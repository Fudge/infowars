[00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:15.271]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:16.731]  You want answers?
[00:00:17.511 --> 00:00:18.392]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:22.653]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:23.233 --> 00:00:27.295]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.383 --> 00:00:49.374]  It was four years ago that Paul Joseph Watson found in a pediatrics journal, in fact, the biggest journal, a paper by two professors of bioethics calling for killing children for any reason you feel like up to age three.
[00:00:50.394 --> 00:00:53.036]  This is all part of the eugenics transhumanist movement.
[00:00:54.147 --> 00:01:10.851]  And when we published an article linking directly to the study and directly to the Journal of Pediatrics, for four or five days people said we put a hoax out because they couldn't believe that someone would say something like that openly.
[00:01:11.991 --> 00:01:19.053]  Even though that's mainline bioethics with Peter Singer at Princeton, it's the same in England, the same thing in Australia.
[00:01:19.113 --> 00:01:20.613]  This is what's been pushed for decades.
[00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.951]  The end of humanity, having no value in humanity.
[00:01:25.832 --> 00:01:27.834]  So that we'll all just roll over and basically die.
[00:01:30.016 --> 00:01:42.067]  Now fast forward four years later after Paul Joseph Watson's original article, which will you guys print me that, Pediatric Journal calls for babies to be able to be killed up to age three.
[00:01:42.948 --> 00:01:47.572]  Now it's in the College Fix and is in major newspapers.
[00:01:50.532 --> 00:01:54.153]  More college students support post-birth abortion.
[00:01:54.673 --> 00:02:07.457]  Now, with a straight face, it's being announced all over the country, and we're sending Joe Biggs out right now to UT, and I'm guessing half the students will see tomorrow.
[00:02:08.497 --> 00:02:10.817]  Or by the nightly news tonight, I don't know how fast they'll get it put together.
[00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:16.199]  I'm guessing half the students will say, kill children, if the government feels like it.
[00:02:17.995 --> 00:02:23.356]  We're not even talking about killing children that are infirm, as they call them, or mentally retarded.
[00:02:24.397 --> 00:02:28.038]  See, in a politically correct world, you don't use the word retarded, but you kill the children.
[00:02:30.218 --> 00:02:43.582]  Just like they say in Apocalypse Now, we train our fighter pilots to drop napalm on men, women, and children and drop death from the air, but we court-martial them if they write the F-word on the side of their airplane.
[00:02:45.612 --> 00:02:46.873]  This is what I've always noticed.
[00:02:47.074 --> 00:02:54.982]  Oh, the FBI created a fake website to nab somebody doing bomb threats over and over again to a Seattle newspaper.
[00:02:57.805 --> 00:03:02.309]  Well, that sounds like real investigative work to me, but it's, oh, it's such a big deal.
[00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:03.270]  It's so horrible.
[00:03:03.651 --> 00:03:04.692]  It's the end of the world.
[00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:05.513]  Meanwhile,
[00:03:06.994 --> 00:03:11.118]  Major defense contractors have been caught running giant child kidnapping rings and no one got in trouble.
[00:03:11.378 --> 00:03:13.220]  And no one's going to say a word about it.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.961]  Even when it's in the Chicago Tribune.
[00:03:15.301 --> 00:03:18.665]  Because that's just so evil and big, we just can't believe that's going on.
[00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:21.947]  The NSA spies on everybody illegally.
[00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:31.076]  But we're going to talk about a cop who punched somebody in the nose.
[00:03:32.366 --> 00:03:33.106]  Which isn't good.
[00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:44.670]  But the point is, they will obsess on some little thing, and act like it's the end of the world, and then massive evil in the private sector, in the public sector, you name it, is just growing exponentially.
[00:03:45.271 --> 00:03:45.911]  So frustrating.
[00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:49.552]  But here's the article, Paul Watson ought to do a flashback.
[00:03:50.593 --> 00:04:00.036]  We actually sent, I think it was Jakari Jackson out last year on this same subject, and got quite a few Austenites on South Congress to say, yes, abort children after birth.
[00:04:02.073 --> 00:04:06.055]  And this is the idea, we're trash, humans don't have any value, roll over and die.
[00:04:06.716 --> 00:04:29.930]  And more and more I realize this is the absolute center, the key to defeating this entire globalist program is understanding why they want us
[00:04:32.278 --> 00:04:36.881]  To not think of ourselves as valuable.
[00:04:37.261 --> 00:04:48.369]  I think it is a celebration of human achievement and the celebration of human inventiveness and beauty, whether it's opera or literature or people being heroic.
[00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.511]  Even though I'll disagree with a war, I can admire someone's
[00:04:52.808 --> 00:04:53.570]  Courage in it.
[00:04:54.712 --> 00:04:57.618]  It is in that celebration that we defeat the New World Order.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.889]  I'm sure of it, and I want to try to codify it into an eloquent soliloquy.
[00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.651]  Stay with us.
[00:05:05.188 --> 00:05:06.189]  The experts are clear.
[00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:13.473]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:05:13.613 --> 00:05:19.876]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[00:05:19.896 --> 00:05:23.478]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[00:05:23.618 --> 00:05:27.520]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.883]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:05:33.143 --> 00:05:34.043]  Not our iodine.
[00:05:34.163 --> 00:05:37.745]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[00:05:37.965 --> 00:05:40.286]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[00:06:05.534 --> 00:06:10.915]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:06:12.196 --> 00:06:16.936]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:06:17.317 --> 00:06:19.197]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.122]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:06:26.044 --> 00:06:28.186]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:06:30.108 --> 00:06:31.929]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:06:32.049 --> 00:06:38.395]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:06:44.206 --> 00:06:46.088]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:06:46.348 --> 00:06:47.869]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:50.691]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:06:51.012 --> 00:06:55.055]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[00:06:55.075 --> 00:06:57.277]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:06:57.657 --> 00:06:59.859]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:07:00.359 --> 00:07:01.780]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:02.381]  Got it.
[00:07:02.721 --> 00:07:03.522]  Others don't.
[00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:14.595]  Using unparalleled research and the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[00:07:14.735 --> 00:07:24.480]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.582]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[00:07:27.782 --> 00:07:28.062]  I think?
[00:07:42.739 --> 00:07:42.999]  We're good.
[00:08:11.894 --> 00:08:16.096]  Aborted babies incinerated to heat the UK hospitals.
[00:08:17.377 --> 00:08:21.299]  Soylent Green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people.
[00:08:21.539 --> 00:08:27.782]  But now, children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals in the UK.
[00:08:27.802 --> 00:08:32.665]  They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[00:08:33.105 --> 00:08:36.987]  It is the secret of Soylent.
[00:08:37.827 --> 00:08:39.849]  The powdered flesh from dead babies.
[00:08:40.329 --> 00:08:42.511]  Some people believe they can cure disease.
[00:08:42.991 --> 00:08:47.094]  Because of its enormous popularity, Soylent Green is in short supply.
[00:08:47.814 --> 00:08:50.536]  Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.
[00:08:50.816 --> 00:08:53.718]  The supply of Soylent Green has been exhausted.
[00:08:54.419 --> 00:08:56.020]  You must evacuate the area.
[00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:10.554]  The federal court ruled that the shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Bilderberg Group Company, are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring, but we already know.
[00:09:11.215 --> 00:09:13.036]  So enjoy the flavor!
[00:09:13.196 --> 00:09:17.661]  We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death penalties and sales taxes.
[00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:19.342]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[00:09:19.803 --> 00:09:21.304]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[00:09:21.664 --> 00:09:22.905]  I'm for regular suicide.
[00:09:22.985 --> 00:09:24.567]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[00:09:24.727 --> 00:09:28.528]  He is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient.
[00:09:29.128 --> 00:09:36.170]  Would it be better not to lay off those ten teachers and to make that trade up in medical costs?
[00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:40.351]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[00:09:40.571 --> 00:09:46.873]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[00:09:55.071 --> 00:09:57.273]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[00:09:57.693 --> 00:10:02.116]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[00:10:02.596 --> 00:10:04.377]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[00:10:05.098 --> 00:10:13.804]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison guards, on the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[00:10:14.464 --> 00:10:16.946]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[00:10:17.646 --> 00:10:19.047]  The scoops are on their way.
[00:10:19.787 --> 00:10:21.287]  The scoops are on their way.
[00:10:22.388 --> 00:10:24.849]  I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[00:10:25.549 --> 00:10:28.330]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life.
[00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.811]  You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[00:10:31.991 --> 00:10:33.291]  We've got to stop them!
[00:10:33.972 --> 00:10:38.493]  That is the secret name, Soylent Green.
[00:10:38.973 --> 00:10:40.734]  Soylent Green is people!
[00:10:40.774 --> 00:10:42.375]  You've got to stop them.
[00:10:42.815 --> 00:10:43.595]  You've got to tell them.
[00:10:43.615 --> 00:10:46.496]  Next thing, they'll be breeding us like cats.
[00:10:52.751 --> 00:10:58.654]  It is October 30th, 2014 on this Worldwide Thursday Transmission.
[00:10:59.234 --> 00:11:01.335]  We had him on for one hour earlier this week.
[00:11:01.375 --> 00:11:02.996]  We've got him for two hours today.
[00:11:03.516 --> 00:11:14.982]  Steve Quayle and the New World Order, Technotronic, Technocracy, Scientific, Transhumanist, World Dictatorship, Rise of the Machines, World Government Plan.
[00:11:16.172 --> 00:11:23.154]  We will both be breaking it down from our perspectives today and taking your phone calls one hour into the interview in the third hour.
[00:11:25.594 --> 00:11:31.395]  We have massive, massive Ebola news, and I'll just go to it right now.
[00:11:31.415 --> 00:11:38.957]  I have said over and over again, and you have said it as well, and our guests have all said it,
[00:11:40.094 --> 00:11:43.515]  You don't have to be a genius to see there's a cover-up going on with the Ebola.
[00:11:43.575 --> 00:11:48.177]  Now, we don't know, at least I don't know exactly what the cover-up is, but it's going on.
[00:11:51.738 --> 00:12:07.824]  They're acting suspicious, they're sneaking around, they're turning off default positions on flights into the US, on issuing West African visas, on not quarantining people, on then saying that people that have had Ebola in the US
[00:12:08.871 --> 00:12:12.813]  Gave it to nurses and doctors, but didn't spread it to other people.
[00:12:13.333 --> 00:12:26.399]  When these doctors and nurses are acting like the fictional character who works in a bio lab, in a microbiology lab, in 12 Monkeys with Bruce Willis.
[00:12:27.639 --> 00:12:37.864]  These doctors and nurses are acting like the guy at the end who goes to all the restaurants and basically bowling alleys and books a bunch of flights.
[00:12:38.885 --> 00:12:39.685]  When he's infected.
[00:12:40.966 --> 00:12:42.386]  These are medical doctors and people.
[00:12:42.426 --> 00:12:43.767]  They're all acting very strange.
[00:12:43.827 --> 00:12:50.369]  So, either it's a hoax and it's not going on, or they've turned off the default positions and are trying to spread it.
[00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:55.831]  And I'm not saying the doctors and nurses are actually doing this, but by their actions they are if they really have Ebola.
[00:12:58.352 --> 00:13:00.073]  Or if they were around people that had Ebola.
[00:13:00.533 --> 00:13:05.235]  Why would you send 5,000 US troops into the middle of a hot zone and then send them to Italy
[00:13:07.216 --> 00:13:11.280]  When one patient brought out of Africa into Spain has spread it.
[00:13:12.461 --> 00:13:16.485]  Why would you bring hundreds of troops in who they say are in some cases are sick?
[00:13:16.805 --> 00:13:20.869]  We have a source inside the base at the highest level.
[00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:21.950]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:13:23.512 --> 00:13:26.895]  In the office at the highest level and there is no quarantine.
[00:13:27.276 --> 00:13:29.598]  There's not even really a gate on the base.
[00:13:29.638 --> 00:13:31.279]  There's just a highway blocker.
[00:13:32.304 --> 00:13:34.025]  A roadblocker at a guard shack.
[00:13:34.085 --> 00:13:35.306]  There's not really a fence.
[00:13:35.786 --> 00:13:38.007]  And there is no quarantine going on.
[00:13:38.047 --> 00:13:44.791]  There's a nurse's station that can hand out aspirin and put band-aids on people's fingers.
[00:13:45.091 --> 00:13:46.732]  The base doesn't even have doctors on it.
[00:13:47.552 --> 00:13:48.513]  It's not a medical base.
[00:13:50.094 --> 00:13:52.675]  And we went and looked up what our source told us and it was all true.
[00:13:52.955 --> 00:13:53.896]  Our source is there.
[00:13:55.036 --> 00:13:56.837]  In the General's office.
[00:13:58.098 --> 00:13:58.958]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:14:00.059 --> 00:14:01.240]  There is no quarantine.
[00:14:02.205 --> 00:14:07.187]  And most of the troops live off base with their families because a lot of them are special forces officers.
[00:14:08.568 --> 00:14:10.189]  Army special forces.
[00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:14.711]  So that's what's going on.
[00:14:16.391 --> 00:14:19.473]  There is no quarantine at the base in Italy.
[00:14:20.153 --> 00:14:22.534]  And we told you that on Monday.
[00:14:22.814 --> 00:14:25.416]  It's now mainstream news that there's not really a quarantine there.
[00:14:27.176 --> 00:14:28.337]  Why did they tell us there was?
[00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:37.752]  Nothing adds up here except a plan to spread Ebola in the United States.
[00:14:37.792 --> 00:14:43.093]  And I've said over and over again, after the election we'll find out whether this was basically a hoax.
[00:14:43.793 --> 00:14:45.414]  There's real Ebola in Africa.
[00:14:47.154 --> 00:14:54.496]  Whether they're just basically using a few cases of people with it to hype things up, or whether they have covered up the fact that it's been spreading.
[00:14:55.136 --> 00:15:00.718]  And then today, Obama comes out with the chilling statement, Reuters headline,
[00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:13.033]  Americans may still see some Ebola cases, Obama says, and he went on to say, we can't be hermetically sealed.
[00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:21.716]  Now only all the government bunkers that are hermetically sealed, you only have at sight are 30 miles from the White House, buddy.
[00:15:22.921 --> 00:15:24.663]  A hermetically sealed underground bunker.
[00:15:25.443 --> 00:15:38.315]  You only have a railway right underneath the White House on record to the Breyer Hotel and other facilities and helicopter pads where if enemy drones came in and sprayed airborne Ebola, you would go into a hermetically sealed chamber.
[00:15:38.475 --> 00:15:38.835]  That's right.
[00:15:39.256 --> 00:15:41.598]  Only you get to be hermetically sealed.
[00:15:42.138 --> 00:15:44.460]  And only NORTHCOM gets to be hermetically sealed.
[00:15:44.821 --> 00:15:47.063]  We don't get to be hermetically sealed, do we?
[00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:52.073]  By the way, we have the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean between us and Africa.
[00:15:52.093 --> 00:15:53.334]  You know, it straddles the two.
[00:15:54.575 --> 00:15:56.216]  We don't need to be hermetically sealed.
[00:15:56.737 --> 00:16:00.039]  We just need you to stop visas from West Africa.
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.922]  And we need you to make U.S.
[00:16:04.223 --> 00:16:10.288]  health workers who go out of the hot zone, out of the Ebola hospitals, then they go back to their
[00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:18.138]  Dormitories and they have a self quarantine and stay there for more than 30 days is really what you're supposed to do because it can last up to 40.
[00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.620]  And then you get on an airplane and come back.
[00:16:20.701 --> 00:16:21.722]  That's what you do.
[00:16:22.843 --> 00:16:24.305]  That's what you've always done.
[00:16:24.445 --> 00:16:26.027]  And so here's the big enchilada.
[00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:31.093]  The fact that he's now getting people ready to say see I told you.
[00:16:32.912 --> 00:16:35.174]  This is like letting out a you-know-what in church.
[00:16:35.774 --> 00:16:38.316]  He's just hoping nobody notices what he's doing.
[00:16:38.957 --> 00:16:40.198]  Shifting around on his chair.
[00:16:40.218 --> 00:16:43.401]  And this is a big sign that Ebola is spreading, in my view.
[00:16:44.381 --> 00:16:53.409]  This is a big sign that, oh, now, it's no big deal, and we can't be hermetically sealed, but I think you may need to expect some more Ebola.
[00:16:56.613 --> 00:16:57.113]  There you go.
[00:16:57.953 --> 00:17:03.654]  It's from a guy who said months ago, there's no way it'll come over here, or then it's unlikely, or, oh, we'll bring healthcare workers here, they won't spread it.
[00:17:03.734 --> 00:17:04.195]  Baloney.
[00:17:04.475 --> 00:17:07.955]  They know full well, you bring in healthcare workers that have got it, they're gonna spread it.
[00:17:09.876 --> 00:17:10.916]  They're spreading it anywhere.
[00:17:11.236 --> 00:17:18.557]  Only Spain and the US are basically dumb enough to bring a bunch of people infected with Ebola in, but they're not dumb.
[00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:22.478]  And remember the rumors that started about three weeks ago in the Washington Free Beacon?
[00:17:22.498 --> 00:17:23.839]  It wasn't a rumor, they had sources.
[00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:24.879]  Drudge linked to it.
[00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:25.639]  We linked to it.
[00:17:29.392 --> 00:17:33.095]  That the White House is planning to bring in foreigners with Ebola?
[00:17:33.156 --> 00:17:35.698]  Well, now it's been announced yesterday that they're looking at doing it.
[00:17:36.118 --> 00:17:36.599]  And why?
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.763]  Because it's over the top and it's meant to break our will.
[00:17:43.205 --> 00:17:48.450]  Why would the Journal of Pediatrics come out with a paper back in 2012
[00:17:50.759 --> 00:17:57.907]  There was another paper before that, two years before, in 2010, and say it's time to start killing babies up to age three.
[00:17:58.287 --> 00:17:59.068]  Here's the headline.
[00:17:59.188 --> 00:18:05.094]  Ethicists argue killing newborn babies should be allowed in the Journal of Medical Ethics.
[00:18:05.715 --> 00:18:07.056]  It was republished in Pediatrics.
[00:18:08.358 --> 00:18:11.401]  Now, when we published this, people didn't believe us, even though we linked to it.
[00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:14.870]  Now, this is being pushed everywhere.
[00:18:15.211 --> 00:18:23.313]  Now it's in collegefix.com, and it links to a bunch of newspapers promoting it, and admits and says it's the new trendy trend.
[00:18:23.333 --> 00:18:25.274]  It says, trending.
[00:18:25.774 --> 00:18:28.094]  More college students support post-birth abortion.
[00:18:28.675 --> 00:18:33.316]  We've already gone out in Austin and about a third of the people want to kill babies for any reason.
[00:18:33.376 --> 00:18:34.837]  Just if you want to kill your kid, go ahead and kill them.
[00:18:36.317 --> 00:18:40.918]  Now, if you spank your child lightly for running out in the street when there are three, they'll take it away from you.
[00:18:40.938 --> 00:18:42.419]  But if you want to kill them, you know, that's fine.
[00:18:43.829 --> 00:18:45.111]  And people say this is over the top.
[00:18:45.852 --> 00:18:50.238]  People, a couple years ago when we first broke this, InfoWars.com broke it.
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:55.345]  Could not believe it when Drudge linked to it and others linked to it.
[00:18:55.825 --> 00:18:57.388]  Even though it was linked to the Pediatrics Journal.
[00:18:58.715 --> 00:19:01.296]  Back then, people said, you've gone too far with this hoax.
[00:19:01.956 --> 00:19:02.697]  No one could believe it.
[00:19:02.717 --> 00:19:11.020]  Just like seven years ago, or six years ago, when we broke the fact that the Homeland Security said the number one enemy was gun owners, returning veterans, Christians, conservatives, that we would all be targeted.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.561]  People thought that was a fake document.
[00:19:12.821 --> 00:19:14.262]  The FBI came out and said, no, it's real.
[00:19:14.702 --> 00:19:15.862]  And Mr. Jones shouldn't have that.
[00:19:17.483 --> 00:19:18.864]  Well, I called the FBI.
[00:19:18.904 --> 00:19:20.684]  I got threatened for having it.
[00:19:21.045 --> 00:19:21.565]  It was real.
[00:19:22.645 --> 00:19:23.586]  Now everybody knows that.
[00:19:23.606 --> 00:19:25.928]  See, this is how they move the Overton window.
[00:19:26.348 --> 00:19:28.009]  And guys, print me the definition of Overton window.
[00:19:28.029 --> 00:19:29.650]  I mean, I know what it is, but I want to read it when we come back.
[00:19:30.951 --> 00:19:32.352]  It's shocking you.
[00:19:32.573 --> 00:19:37.416]  See, at first, you're shocked that they're going to teach your five-year-olds how to have anal sex in public school.
[00:19:37.636 --> 00:19:42.660]  But now, Jocelyn Elders, you know, back in the 90s saying, help five-year-olds masturbate at school.
[00:19:43.281 --> 00:19:44.442]  Now that's not shocking, is it?
[00:19:44.982 --> 00:19:45.162]  See?
[00:19:45.703 --> 00:19:46.763]  Or, hey, let's kill babies.
[00:19:46.803 --> 00:19:47.584]  Let's kill old people.
[00:19:47.624 --> 00:19:48.124]  Death panels.
[00:19:48.545 --> 00:19:49.866]  Remember, oh, there's no death panels now.
[00:19:49.886 --> 00:19:50.546]  Of course there are.
[00:19:51.147 --> 00:19:51.307]  See?
[00:19:52.748 --> 00:19:56.093]  Just like, veterans are terrorists, oh that's not true, now it's all just accepted.
[00:19:56.433 --> 00:19:57.975]  This is how they condition us.
[00:19:58.436 --> 00:20:03.362]  When they say our kids belong to them, 2 plus 2 equals 5, they are conditioning us.
[00:20:05.698 --> 00:20:13.621]  Virtually anyone can hack your cell phone and track your calls, your texts, your emails, your every movement, but only if they can detect a signal.

[00:20:27.986 --> 00:20:28.907]  Enhancing health and privacy.
[00:20:35.089 --> 00:20:38.091]  In today's unstable environment, self-protection is critical.
[00:20:38.171 --> 00:20:39.792]  Civil unrest, riots, looting.
[00:20:39.972 --> 00:20:42.134]  It's happening now, right here in the United States.
[00:20:42.454 --> 00:20:43.775]  And your rights are at risk.
[00:20:44.055 --> 00:20:48.138]  If passed, HR 5344 would ban Level 3 and above body armor.
[00:20:48.418 --> 00:20:50.360]  KD Armor is standing up for you.
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.642]  We offer the most affordable Level 3 body armor on the market.

[00:21:03.068 --> 00:21:03.929]  Come and take it.
[00:21:04.489 --> 00:21:05.710]  Another major health threat.
[00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:10.632]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:21:10.712 --> 00:21:13.354]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:21:13.394 --> 00:21:20.177]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:21:20.437 --> 00:21:23.299]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:21:23.399 --> 00:21:26.320]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.361]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:21:28.401 --> 00:21:31.263]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:21:31.323 --> 00:21:36.828]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:21:37.048 --> 00:21:40.531]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.

[00:22:04.079 --> 00:22:08.082]  This is a nationwide announcement for consumers owing back taxes to the IRS.
[00:22:08.302 --> 00:22:09.423]  The slowdown in the U.S.
[00:22:09.463 --> 00:22:12.605]  economy has forced renewed action by the Internal Revenue Service.
[00:22:12.825 --> 00:22:17.448]  The IRS is now accepting reduced settlement amounts from qualifying consumers who owe back taxes.
[00:22:17.648 --> 00:22:21.491]  If you're eligible, your back tax settlement may be discounted by thousands of dollars.
[00:22:21.711 --> 00:22:25.814]  A specially assigned national hotline has been directly routed to Defense Tax Group.

[00:22:30.037 --> 00:22:36.799]  Financial stability is a major priority during this slow economy, so you're advised to dial this national hotline number now.
[00:22:36.819 --> 00:22:36.860]  800-678-4191.

[00:22:54.806 --> 00:22:54.846]  800-678-4191.
[00:22:54.866 --> 00:22:57.247]  On September 30th, 2014, the first confirmed case of Ebola appeared in the U.S.
[00:22:57.267 --> 00:23:03.690]  This, combined with several other unidentified viruses, have some of our customers at 30dayfoodsupply.com concerned about the safety of our domestic food supply
[00:23:17.296 --> 00:23:20.318]  Resulting in a surge of our $99.90 serving kits.
[00:23:20.678 --> 00:23:33.765]  While we at 30dayfoodsupply.com have no expertise in epidemiology, we are aggressively purchasing raw materials that are currently in stock and we intend to continue to sell our 30-day non-GMO emergency food supply

[00:24:06.179 --> 00:24:11.301]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:12.001 --> 00:24:20.384]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:21.864 --> 00:24:33.608]  The truth is that until we stop this outbreak in West Africa, we may continue to see individual cases in America in the weeks and months ahead.
[00:24:35.273 --> 00:24:38.156]  Because that's the nature of today's world.
[00:24:38.596 --> 00:24:40.878]  We can't hermetically seal ourselves off.
[00:24:41.639 --> 00:24:46.123]  Critical that we remain focused on the facts and on the science.
[00:24:48.185 --> 00:24:56.853]  Keep in mind that of the seven Americans treated for Ebola so far, most of them while serving in West Africa, all seven have survived.
[00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:05.833]  Right now, the only American still undergoing treatment is Dr. Craig Spencer, who contracted the disease abroad while working to protect others.
[00:25:06.954 --> 00:25:07.934]  And we salute his service.
[00:25:10.356 --> 00:25:13.417]  Okay, well, basically, all of that is a lie.
[00:25:13.998 --> 00:25:22.062]  If your neighbor's house is on fire, A, you want to get the fire department there, you want to get people out of the house if they're in there, and then you want to protect your house.
[00:25:22.942 --> 00:25:28.645]  That may mean getting a water hose out in spring, the area of your house that's closest to the house that's on fire.
[00:25:31.966 --> 00:25:37.207]  So, saying in today's age we can't do anything about this, since when can we not?
[00:25:38.747 --> 00:25:53.530]  If some super flu gets out, if some super mousepox or smallpox gets out, which undoubtedly is going to happen, pandemics come and go, they've always tried to quarantine people, they've always tried to stop flights or shipments in and out of those countries and screen people.
[00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:56.650]  Now, under globalism, they're saying, no, we can't do that.
[00:25:57.211 --> 00:25:59.451]  We have to respond all over the world globally.
[00:26:00.267 --> 00:26:13.374]  The North American Union documents from BAMF Canada and from WACO, 2005-2007, BAMF's 2007, they state, we will use global pandemics to bring in one world government.
[00:26:15.035 --> 00:26:17.576]  And what is the Secretary of Defense Hagel saying in a quote today?
[00:26:18.036 --> 00:26:21.738]  I think we are living through one of these historic, defining times.
[00:26:21.818 --> 00:26:24.439]  I think we are seeing a new world order.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.081]  Their new order they're bringing in.
[00:26:28.643 --> 00:26:30.444]  There's different definitions of the New World Order.
[00:26:30.464 --> 00:26:32.986]  A New World Order would mean a new global power alignment.
[00:26:33.026 --> 00:26:34.768]  It can mean that in its purest sense.
[00:26:34.788 --> 00:26:48.738]  But when they say New World Order, they mean a New World Order run by these corporate Rothschilds, Rockefeller, Sachs-Coburg, Gotha, House of Orange, exterminists, just scum of the earth.
[00:26:51.601 --> 00:26:55.624]  I just named the names of who sits on top, Anglo-American oil,
[00:26:57.059 --> 00:26:59.341]  who sits across the Anglo-American establishment.
[00:26:59.501 --> 00:27:00.682]  That's not my name for it.
[00:27:00.882 --> 00:27:04.945]  That's what all their top historians call it in their internal documents that are public.
[00:27:05.145 --> 00:27:07.547]  If you'd like to go read this stuff, it's not widely published.
[00:27:07.767 --> 00:27:13.111]  We sell the book, Tragedy and Hope, written by Carol Quigley, the head of Georgetown Political Science, Bill Clinton's mentor.
[00:27:17.154 --> 00:27:20.517]  I want to thank David Rockefeller, and I want to thank Professor Carol Quigley.
[00:27:20.637 --> 00:27:23.439]  Remember when he gave his acceptance speech, started crying?
[00:27:23.819 --> 00:27:24.740]  Thank you, David.
[00:27:27.435 --> 00:27:29.796]  Yeah, David's been helping Billy Boy since high school.
[00:27:31.116 --> 00:27:36.698]  And that's because a well-known Rockefeller liked to visit Mama, and Mama was a lady of the night.
[00:27:36.758 --> 00:27:37.998]  By the way, this is all on record.
[00:27:41.319 --> 00:27:43.019]  The Kings did that a long time ago.
[00:27:43.039 --> 00:27:49.521]  They'd have a whole bunch of illegitimate sons from their jillies down in the town, and then they'd put them in charge of things.
[00:27:50.061 --> 00:27:55.163]  You'd have generals and admirals and all these other folks that were really, really
[00:27:56.954 --> 00:27:58.335]  Been sired by the king.
[00:28:00.277 --> 00:28:03.099]  And the more the world changes, the more it stays the same.
[00:28:07.402 --> 00:28:09.264]  David Rockefeller just taking care of the family.
[00:28:09.324 --> 00:28:10.685]  Clinton is a Rockefeller, folks.
[00:28:11.065 --> 00:28:11.586]  Go look it up.
[00:28:12.727 --> 00:28:14.168]  I'm a Rockefeller governor down there.
[00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:18.291]  His mama was a whore, that's on record.
[00:28:22.295 --> 00:28:26.078]  And I'm not saying that's, I'm not judging her.
[00:28:27.028 --> 00:28:28.508]  Just saying where Bill Clinton comes from.
[00:28:28.528 --> 00:28:31.929]  A little fat issue, a little bit of history there for folks who might want to know about it.
[00:28:33.009 --> 00:28:34.770]  But I guess he got a strong sex drive from her.
[00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:39.691]  He is a sex addict, that's admitted.
[00:28:40.471 --> 00:28:45.592]  FBI demands new powers to hack into computers and carry out surveillance.
[00:28:46.292 --> 00:28:49.272]  This is in the Guardian, and of course they're already doing it, they just want to mainline it.
[00:28:49.513 --> 00:28:56.534]  Then there's this story, the Pirate Bay, Pirate Bay founder, Gottfried, how do you pronounce that last name?
[00:28:57.645 --> 00:29:03.531]  You know, the next name, Godfred Savartholme, found guilty in hacking trial.
[00:29:04.953 --> 00:29:05.573]  Spartsholm.
[00:29:06.454 --> 00:29:13.702]  Lawyer, it's clear that my client's computer has been the subject of remote control and therefore he's not responsible.
[00:29:15.575 --> 00:29:18.696]  Yeah, that's what you should understand about this whole two-way system with all the back doors.
[00:29:19.056 --> 00:29:25.739]  They go on your computer and say they're surveilling and this is the government caught hundreds of thousands of times framing people.
[00:29:26.459 --> 00:29:29.701]  They have parallel construction that we told you about years ago, now it's in Reuters.
[00:29:31.581 --> 00:29:35.183]  Where they go create whole fake court cases and go lie to the judge to put you in prison.
[00:29:36.616 --> 00:29:38.238]  Do you have any idea how corrupt the system is?
[00:29:38.478 --> 00:29:46.745]  When we come back, though, the latest on the election, the latest on the new trendy thing is the call to start killing all the old people and basically children up to age 5.
[00:29:47.286 --> 00:29:49.328]  And if you don't do it, you're racist and you're not trendy.
[00:29:49.348 --> 00:29:49.948]  And I'm not joking.
[00:29:50.449 --> 00:29:51.950]  We'll tie it into the Overton window.
[00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:52.791]  Straight ahead.
[00:29:52.831 --> 00:29:53.291]  Stay with me.
[00:29:54.553 --> 00:29:55.433]  We're on the march.
[00:29:55.934 --> 00:29:57.535]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:58.456 --> 00:30:01.139]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:05.786 --> 00:30:08.227]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:30:08.407 --> 00:30:09.447]  Check it out today.
[00:30:09.907 --> 00:30:18.090]  I have set out to bring you the most hardcore, cutting-edge supplements and nutraceuticals bar none, and that's what you'll find at Infowarslife.com.
[00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:24.232]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not
[00:30:24.472 --> 00:30:34.979]  Of the very highest quality, or because they're not 100% organic, or because they don't pass all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at Infowarslife.com.
[00:30:35.139 --> 00:30:46.026]  Whether it's survival shield nascent iodine, or DNA force, super male vitality, super female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shield, oxy powder, I believe,
[00:30:46.206 --> 00:30:46.906]  We're good to go.
[00:31:05.942 --> 00:31:07.543]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[00:31:07.883 --> 00:31:11.625]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[00:31:12.405 --> 00:31:16.728]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[00:31:16.868 --> 00:31:23.671]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[00:31:24.191 --> 00:31:33.236]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:31:33.476 --> 00:31:38.938]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[00:31:39.018 --> 00:31:46.282]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.
[00:31:46.602 --> 00:31:48.883]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:31:49.183 --> 00:31:54.285]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the Info War.
[00:31:54.665 --> 00:31:59.333]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:31:59.353 --> 00:32:00.636]  DNA Force from InfoWarsLife.
[00:32:05.922 --> 00:32:09.424]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:32:09.584 --> 00:32:13.547]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:32:13.867 --> 00:32:15.308]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:32:15.648 --> 00:32:23.213]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:32:23.493 --> 00:32:24.354]  But for how long?
[00:32:24.634 --> 00:32:30.898]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:32:31.278 --> 00:32:34.100]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:32:35.609 --> 00:32:45.752]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[00:32:46.172 --> 00:32:52.314]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:32:52.614 --> 00:32:54.854]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:32:54.954 --> 00:32:58.015]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[00:32:58.055 --> 00:33:04.917]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:33:10.051 --> 00:33:13.553]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:33:14.154 --> 00:33:15.955]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:16.915 --> 00:33:20.057]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:33:20.598 --> 00:33:22.879]  Run on for a long time.
[00:33:23.539 --> 00:33:25.701]  Run on for a long time.
[00:33:26.401 --> 00:33:28.843]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[00:33:29.403 --> 00:33:31.845]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[00:33:34.025 --> 00:33:49.456]  Well, senior Democrats are being caught commanding hordes of illegal aliens to vote repeatedly.
[00:33:50.496 --> 00:33:51.477]  People are being indicted.
[00:33:51.517 --> 00:33:54.339]  Democrats are being caught stealing yard signs in the middle of the night.
[00:33:55.811 --> 00:33:59.794]  Because the Democrats are the people that steal elections at the retail level.
[00:33:59.814 --> 00:34:01.276]  They also do it through voting machines.
[00:34:01.616 --> 00:34:04.138]  Republicans do that as well, historically.
[00:34:04.178 --> 00:34:10.543]  We see both sides doing that, and a lot of overlap, but this is a dirty, dirty, dirty election.
[00:34:11.324 --> 00:34:23.955]  And Obama clearly came out yesterday, we played the clip yesterday, two days ago, he came out in a speech and said, now you can vote all week long, now I don't mean vote twice!
[00:34:25.347 --> 00:34:25.567]  No!
[00:34:25.847 --> 00:34:26.308]  Wink wink!
[00:34:27.008 --> 00:34:27.969]  This ain't Chicago!
[00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:30.271]  I'm sorry, Chicago.
[00:34:30.751 --> 00:34:32.012]  I'm just from Chicago.
[00:34:34.994 --> 00:34:39.498]  And they're battling with the Justice Department to let illegal aliens vote and they are all over the country.
[00:34:40.218 --> 00:34:43.341]  And look, I can't go to Latin America or China and I can't vote.
[00:34:43.361 --> 00:34:44.081]  They would laugh at me.
[00:34:45.803 --> 00:34:52.548]  But Americans have such incredible hospitality and have been guilted into putting up with anything and everything.
[00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:58.110]  It is so frustrating.
[00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:10.932]  I want to get into the Overton window and tie it into what it means with the moves for death panels, putting the troops on secret death list, dehydrating old people, killing babies up to age five now.
[00:35:10.952 --> 00:35:12.333]  That's what they're calling babies.
[00:35:14.313 --> 00:35:15.553]  This is already going on.
[00:35:17.314 --> 00:35:20.254]  But it's back in the newspaper and it's the bioethicist boards.
[00:35:20.274 --> 00:35:23.975]  So we're going to be breaking that down, the latest on Ebola and more.
[00:35:24.355 --> 00:35:25.135]  But first off,
[00:35:27.034 --> 00:35:34.198]  I took some of the classic designs that I liked out there and kind of changed them and told my graphics folks what I wanted.
[00:35:34.599 --> 00:35:49.648]  And the reason I say that is these are kind of Alex Jones designs, just like the belt buckles are and a lot of the other products that you find at MadeIn1776.com, our Made in America line of Patriot apparel.
[00:35:50.348 --> 00:35:56.112]  And it's a great way to interact with like-minded people, to meet like-minded folks, to have conversation starters.
[00:35:57.421 --> 00:36:02.306]  And about a year ago we came out with the first Molon Labe shirts that weren't just come and take it in English.
[00:36:02.947 --> 00:36:16.020]  You go back thousands of years ago to Greece and of course it's a battle with the Persians and saying come and take it and 300 soldiers for several days holding off tens of thousands and that's a true story.
[00:36:17.201 --> 00:36:20.445]  Popularized of course I guess by Marvel Comics.
[00:36:22.498 --> 00:36:38.513]  And then it moves forward through many other civilizations and times where people said the same thing, hearkening back to 300, saying, come and take it, which means molon labe in Greek, or I guess translated into Latin or Roman.
[00:36:40.335 --> 00:36:41.916]  And then, of course, the Texas Revolution.
[00:36:43.098 --> 00:36:50.763]  Um, with my ancestors in Gonzales, um, who were there refusing to turn in their firearms and the cannon they had.
[00:36:50.783 --> 00:36:57.368]  Um, and so here came Santa Ana and he won the first battles, but he lost the war, didn't he?
[00:36:57.768 --> 00:36:58.608]  And that's how it works.
[00:36:58.648 --> 00:37:03.712]  And then the British came, of course, before that in 1776 and said, turn in your guns at Lexington and Concord.
[00:37:04.792 --> 00:37:10.196]  Um, the Declaration of Independence was in 1776, Lexington and Concord before that in April.
[00:37:12.142 --> 00:37:15.543]  And of course, that kicked off the shot heard around the world.
[00:37:16.103 --> 00:37:25.167]  We are declaring Molon Labe on our children, on our private property, on our guns, on our free speech, on our culture, on our sovereignty.
[00:37:26.427 --> 00:37:28.148]  That's what Molon Labe is all about.
[00:37:28.768 --> 00:37:30.789]  And so this new camouflage
[00:37:32.159 --> 00:37:34.221]  Molon Labe Special Forces style.
[00:37:34.281 --> 00:37:48.491]  I said I want to like the Special Forces style that are so popular with the American flag and camo on the left arm, Info Wars on the back, and then the big Molon Labe Spartan on the front with 250 cal shells crossed.
[00:37:50.953 --> 00:37:53.415]  It is a very good-looking shirt.
[00:37:53.515 --> 00:37:55.897]  It says 1776 on both sides of the helmet.
[00:37:57.506 --> 00:37:59.107]  And I put this on today.
[00:37:59.147 --> 00:37:59.848]  I've never worn it.
[00:37:59.888 --> 00:38:00.908]  It's been in for a few weeks.
[00:38:01.549 --> 00:38:10.595]  And everywhere I went, just because I was doing some business downtown, went into a cafe, was walking through a parking garage.
[00:38:11.075 --> 00:38:14.217]  I came into the office and was mobbed over this shirt.
[00:38:14.918 --> 00:38:16.719]  I think it's the biggest hit we're ever going to have.
[00:38:16.739 --> 00:38:16.799]  And
[00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:20.931]  It's super handsome.
[00:38:21.571 --> 00:38:24.553]  And I had two women ask me, do you have it in women's?
[00:38:24.593 --> 00:38:25.914]  Like, where'd you get that?
[00:38:26.495 --> 00:38:28.576]  And do they have it in for women?
[00:38:28.856 --> 00:38:29.897]  And no, the answer is we don't.
[00:38:30.177 --> 00:38:32.739]  We've probably come out with one for women that say black on gray, maybe.
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:35.961]  But we'll immediately try to get that in the pipeline.
[00:38:35.981 --> 00:38:38.062]  I don't mean to take a bunch of time out getting into this.
[00:38:38.122 --> 00:38:38.863]  It's not just a plug.
[00:38:38.883 --> 00:38:42.825]  We're talking about Molon Labe, come and take it, where those type of stands come from.
[00:38:43.186 --> 00:38:45.007]  The Alamo, they said, come and take it.
[00:38:45.347 --> 00:38:49.390]  And they all died, just like in Greece, but they are now immortal.
[00:38:50.959 --> 00:38:55.763]  And really no one out there can try to say that they weren't men.
[00:38:56.583 --> 00:38:58.164]  And that they didn't have amazing courage.
[00:38:58.444 --> 00:39:00.646]  Because that's what people really admire.
[00:39:01.787 --> 00:39:05.289]  Is the underdog that won't back down in the face of a tyrant.
[00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:07.351]  And they try to demonize Texas.
[00:39:08.352 --> 00:39:10.413]  Santa Ana was later overthrown in Mexico.
[00:39:10.673 --> 00:39:12.795]  He lost Guatemala as well, that was part of Mexico.
[00:39:13.015 --> 00:39:13.956]  He was a horrible thug.
[00:39:14.476 --> 00:39:16.698]  Like Hitler, like Napoleon, like King George III.
[00:39:18.717 --> 00:39:19.897]  So that's what it comes down to.
[00:39:19.937 --> 00:39:22.558]  So I hope everybody will go to infowarestore.com.
[00:39:22.578 --> 00:39:23.779]  It makes a great Christmas gift.
[00:39:24.339 --> 00:39:25.919]  And we're producing as many of these as we can.
[00:39:25.999 --> 00:39:28.080]  It is now the newest bestseller.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:32.101]  Long-sleeved camo Molon Labe.
[00:39:32.501 --> 00:39:38.603]  Available at madein1776.com or infowarestore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:39:38.623 --> 00:39:44.505]  And yes, we are going to sell out of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:39:44.945 --> 00:39:47.826]  We have an emergency order in trying to produce more.
[00:39:49.793 --> 00:40:01.664]  But the crystals are very volatile and it takes time in the laboratory laboratory factory to produce it and then to infuse it by gas in a secret patented system into the
[00:40:03.399 --> 00:40:06.081]  Organic palm oil, heart of palm oil.
[00:40:06.822 --> 00:40:08.523]  We're selling out of the Survival Shield X2.
[00:40:08.563 --> 00:40:13.487]  We do have a stockpile of original Survival Shield, but at this rate, it'll sell out as well.
[00:40:13.928 --> 00:40:21.614]  So both of those are available, and if you don't know why, true, pure iodine, not like all the other stuff that's out there, and the other stuff out there is great for you.
[00:40:21.934 --> 00:40:22.775]  That's what I got started on.
[00:40:23.135 --> 00:40:29.220]  I just wanted to escalate it into something that was truly cutting edge, and it turned out to just be the best thing ever.
[00:40:30.296 --> 00:40:35.097]  in supplements and we have at InfoWarsLife.com and we have a special running.
[00:40:35.197 --> 00:40:36.877]  Who runs specials when something's selling out?
[00:40:37.878 --> 00:40:41.718]  5% off everything at InfoWarsLife.com with promo code NOW.
[00:40:42.178 --> 00:40:45.959]  Even when there's a special or a discount already on it, 5% more.
[00:40:46.679 --> 00:40:53.021]  But the one special that doesn't have the 5% is because it has 10% and that's just right away.
[00:40:53.061 --> 00:40:54.281]  Don't even need promo code NOW.
[00:40:54.661 --> 00:40:58.802]  When you get the Biodefense Pack Survival Shield X2 with Lung Cleanse
[00:40:59.741 --> 00:41:02.265]  You get 10% off both of them.
[00:41:02.626 --> 00:41:04.729]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:11.419]  And Lung Cleanse is also starting to sell out because of its proprietary nature and what those essential oils do.
[00:41:12.489 --> 00:41:14.310]  And your purchase makes the transmission possible.
[00:41:14.691 --> 00:41:19.114]  Please support our local AM and FM affiliates, support their local sponsors, or become a sponsor as well.
[00:41:19.134 --> 00:41:29.861]  And whatever you do, tell friends and family about InfoWars.com, about PrisonPlanet.com, and about the local radio station's website, and how they can tune into this broadcast.
[00:41:30.442 --> 00:41:33.964]  All right, because that's the easiest way to wake somebody up, is just point them at the show.
[00:41:35.825 --> 00:41:40.669]  Now, before I get back into Ebola, and before I get into the economy, and just a bunch of massively important news,
[00:41:41.735 --> 00:41:46.578]  Patriot Act news, GMO news, huge stock market news.
[00:41:47.238 --> 00:41:53.842]  Before I get into all that with Steve Quayle coming up, and Obama preparing his amnesty plan.
[00:41:54.262 --> 00:41:56.103]  They've already launched it, he's just going to announce it.
[00:41:56.483 --> 00:41:57.283]  Basically no borders.
[00:41:57.323 --> 00:41:58.084]  North American Union.
[00:42:00.005 --> 00:42:09.854]  The CDC has now come out and told you what we told you two months ago, that it is spread by sneezes, it is airborne, and in cold temperatures it can live for days on surfaces and travel miles.
[00:42:10.515 --> 00:42:15.119]  It's in the Army manuals, it's in the CDC manuals, it's in the WHO manuals.
[00:42:15.539 --> 00:42:18.102]  All we did was write articles two and a half months ago off the manuals.
[00:42:18.622 --> 00:42:38.112]  So, it's not that I'm a virologist, it's not that I'm a rocket scientist, it's not that I'm an astrophysicist, it's not that I'm a meteorologist, it's not that I'm a historian, it's not that I'm a former top FBI agent, or top CIA agent, or top NSA agent, or top everything, or top special forces commander, it's that I've interviewed thousands of them!
[00:42:38.312 --> 00:42:39.273]  The top hackers!
[00:42:39.453 --> 00:42:40.493]  The top scientists!
[00:42:40.674 --> 00:42:42.174]  The top GMO scientists!
[00:42:42.374 --> 00:42:43.335]  The top activists!
[00:42:45.031 --> 00:42:49.032]  I'm here, some days up to 18 hours a day, immersed in this.
[00:42:49.272 --> 00:42:51.192]  That's why we know what we're talking about.
[00:42:53.673 --> 00:43:03.115]  Just like somebody who watches 18 hours a day of SportsCenter could be a commentator, because you've learned all that mindless fluff.
[00:43:03.555 --> 00:43:04.535]  I'm talking to new listeners.
[00:43:04.935 --> 00:43:05.775]  I didn't do that.
[00:43:06.856 --> 00:43:07.796]  I tried to learn about
[00:43:08.851 --> 00:43:22.183]  Put options, and short-selling, and naked shorts, and the branches of government, and federal rulings, and how the courts work, and different regions of the world, and mysteries of the universe that are all around us.
[00:43:22.503 --> 00:43:24.865]  Endless data, endless information.
[00:43:26.647 --> 00:43:32.092]  And it's just so amazing how wonderful this world is, but at the same time how ugly it is.
[00:43:32.592 --> 00:43:34.054]  And the two contrast together.
[00:43:34.969 --> 00:43:56.638]  In a palette that is beyond anything that could come out of the mind of Hieronymus Bosch meets Beethoven meets Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung all mixed together with explosions and sunsets and the deepest sea.
[00:43:58.999 --> 00:43:59.900]  I want to write a book
[00:44:01.363 --> 00:44:27.664]  about the wonders of the world and all of the magic experiences that I've personally had and I've shared with others and just the depth of how incredible consciousness is on a planet in deep space staring out at trillions of galaxies and we're here looking at Obama and red carpets and Miley Cyrus
[00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:34.731]  That's the devil for you.
[00:44:35.791 --> 00:44:40.194]  Dominating our consciousness, making us focus in just to have a little bit of freedom.
[00:44:40.414 --> 00:44:55.704]  We have to fight and claw with these control freaks that want to insert us into a giant Times Square false reality, bombarding us with all their narcissistic slop.
[00:44:59.246 --> 00:44:59.827]  What a joke.
[00:45:01.033 --> 00:45:07.997]  I want to transcend these people, and I realize more than ever, transcending them mentally, spiritually, with our consciousness.
[00:45:08.897 --> 00:45:11.559]  Understanding that, and not having fear.
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:15.901]  But at the same time, having great energy against the enemy.
[00:45:17.862 --> 00:45:24.106]  To overthrow their system in a peaceful revolution of total renaissance.
[00:45:25.306 --> 00:45:27.367]  The great enlightenment of enlightenments.
[00:45:28.388 --> 00:45:30.409]  Freeing the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:45:33.373 --> 00:45:35.015]  But can you handle consciousness?
[00:45:36.037 --> 00:45:37.479]  Can you handle being awake?
[00:45:38.099 --> 00:45:39.401]  Doesn't mean you believe what I believe.
[00:45:39.802 --> 00:45:44.749]  It means you stare out into the vastness of God's creation.
[00:45:46.471 --> 00:45:47.092]  It's incredible.
[00:45:48.686 --> 00:45:52.487]  Speaking of consciousness and perception, here's a definition of the Overton window.
[00:45:52.887 --> 00:45:58.929]  It is a political theory that describes the range of ideas the public will accept as a narrow window according to the theory.
[00:45:59.609 --> 00:46:06.751]  An idea's political viability depends mainly on whether it falls within the window rather than on politicians' individual preferences.
[00:46:07.371 --> 00:46:15.493]  It is named for its orator and originator, Joseph P. Overton, a former vice president
[00:46:16.796 --> 00:46:31.893]  of the Manakee Center for Public Policy and he went on, at any given climate of public opinion, which a politician can recommend without being considered too extreme, to gain or keep public office.
[00:46:33.484 --> 00:46:36.405]  And what they do is they try to shock the Overton window.
[00:46:36.786 --> 00:46:46.950]  They know when they come out on MSNBC and say 2 plus 2 equals 5, your kids belong to the state, fathers are bad, all sex between a man and woman is rape, 2 plus 2 might equal 3.
[00:46:48.311 --> 00:46:49.471]  You didn't build your business.
[00:46:50.171 --> 00:46:51.952]  Small businesses don't hire people.
[00:46:52.832 --> 00:46:54.673]  Raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit.
[00:46:54.873 --> 00:46:56.333]  We're never going to come after your guns.
[00:46:56.653 --> 00:46:59.514]  It's pro-Second Amendment to turn your guns in, aka Bloomberg.
[00:47:00.074 --> 00:47:05.895]  All of these attacks on reality are meant to just shock you until you just accept anything.
[00:47:05.955 --> 00:47:16.098]  It's destroying the entire window where you're in a catatonic state of cognitive learned helplessness dissidence.
[00:47:17.384 --> 00:47:35.857]  And normalcy bias, where the new normal is anything goes for the system and whoever is on television, whoever is establishment, whoever says they're in charge, but then you play with a Nerf gun in your backyard when you're 12 and you're going to be suspended and the police are going to come.
[00:47:36.257 --> 00:47:43.722]  Or you post a shot of yourself on Facebook with a BB gun, you're expelled, even though there's no law and no jurisdiction of the school.
[00:47:45.257 --> 00:47:49.298]  Just like they'll arrest parents who don't vaccinate their children when there's no law to vaccinate.
[00:47:49.999 --> 00:47:56.180]  And they'll go lie to the jury and charge them under something else and the lawyer will play along and won't even tell you.
[00:48:02.182 --> 00:48:04.583]  The feds are scrambling to buy hazmat suits.
[00:48:08.598 --> 00:48:11.560]  Top link on DrugsReport.com, InfoWars.com.
[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:14.942]  You add that in with Obama saying, oh, there'll probably be some more Ebola cases.
[00:48:15.323 --> 00:48:17.784]  Tells me there's a cover-up for after the election.
[00:48:19.485 --> 00:48:23.408]  I think the Ebola overall is real, and I think it is spreading.
[00:48:23.448 --> 00:48:25.209]  I don't know how bad, and I think they're covering it up.
[00:48:25.249 --> 00:48:30.053]  And I know doctors say they're disappearing people, but that's the Overton window.
[00:48:30.233 --> 00:48:37.618]  If they can go into hospitals and have the hospitals go along with, we're the feds, no paperwork, we're disappearing people.
[00:48:39.113 --> 00:48:42.375]  And doctors go public, and there's no investigation.
[00:48:42.576 --> 00:48:45.057]  They didn't come out and say that doctor we had on was a liar.
[00:48:45.338 --> 00:48:48.340]  He runs three hospitals, three regional clinics.
[00:48:49.701 --> 00:48:56.206]  He reported at the place he did his internship, Harry Truman Center, that there was Ebola, or what looked like Ebola.
[00:48:56.666 --> 00:48:57.707]  They didn't respond.
[00:48:57.827 --> 00:48:58.767]  They didn't deny.
[00:48:59.048 --> 00:49:00.088]  They didn't fire him.
[00:49:00.369 --> 00:49:06.133]  They didn't say jack squat, even though that was in newspapers all over the country, saying, look what Alex Jones is up to now.
[00:49:07.995 --> 00:49:10.216]  And I've talked to other medical doctors that say the same thing's going on.
[00:49:11.357 --> 00:49:12.177]  See the Overton window?
[00:49:12.418 --> 00:49:19.141]  Where the media sits there and ridicules us for having sources by name putting their jobs and lives on the line.
[00:49:20.842 --> 00:49:22.503]  And they just say, look at the nutball.
[00:49:26.005 --> 00:49:26.846]  Look at the nutball.
[00:49:26.886 --> 00:49:28.307]  He didn't want to bring Ebola patients in.
[00:49:28.347 --> 00:49:29.087]  He says it'll spread.
[00:49:29.107 --> 00:49:29.988]  And it started spreading.
[00:49:30.568 --> 00:49:31.228]  Look at the nutball.
[00:49:31.248 --> 00:49:31.649]  Look at the nutball.
[00:49:31.849 --> 00:49:34.170]  It's not that I'm saying, oh, aren't I smart?
[00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:36.952]  I'm in the normalcy area, historically.
[00:49:37.725 --> 00:49:40.566]  They call me a deranged right-wing conspiracy theorist at the White House.
[00:49:42.166 --> 00:49:42.786]  Media matters.
[00:49:44.127 --> 00:49:49.948]  Because I'm simply saying 2 plus 2 equals 4, and if anybody resonates with that, that's game over for them.
[00:49:52.329 --> 00:49:53.710]  So see, that's the Overton window.
[00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:54.930]  That's why they came out.
[00:49:56.736 --> 00:50:01.299]  In the Journal of Medical Ethics, in February of 2012, and said,
[00:50:28.057 --> 00:50:32.859]  And now they've got it in one of the biggest sites out there, College Fix, trending.
[00:50:33.159 --> 00:50:36.080]  More college students support post-birth abortion.
[00:50:36.421 --> 00:50:43.644]  And it links to TV shows and news articles and stories where it is the new hot thing to say, let's start killing kids.
[00:50:44.284 --> 00:50:46.505]  See, Overton Window.
[00:50:47.646 --> 00:50:49.247]  Overton Window.
[00:50:49.687 --> 00:50:53.989]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to... They're getting us ready for everything.
[00:50:54.369 --> 00:50:55.329]  Alex Jones.
[00:50:55.349 --> 00:50:56.250]  They're going over the top.
[00:50:57.639 --> 00:50:57.960]  You see?
[00:50:57.980 --> 00:50:59.423]  It's what it's all about.
[00:50:59.443 --> 00:51:02.810]  Just getting you totally shocked and ready, and then rolling it out.
[00:51:06.047 --> 00:51:10.991]  My Magic Mud is a tooth whitening powder that removes plaque and detoxifies your mouth.

[00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:12.314]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:12.574 --> 00:52:20.460]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:20.701 --> 00:52:25.004]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:25.224 --> 00:52:29.027]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:29.187 --> 00:52:34.891]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:35.131 --> 00:52:37.913]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:38.293 --> 00:52:43.517]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[00:54:01.709 --> 00:54:06.790]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:54:08.611 --> 00:54:12.412]  Alright, you wanna go?
[00:54:14.693 --> 00:54:17.494]  Alright, you wanna go?
[00:54:32.168 --> 00:54:34.949]  Okay, friends.
[00:54:34.969 --> 00:54:36.909]  We have breaking news during the break.
[00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:46.712]  Paul Joseph Watson, whose story is top-linked on DrudgeReport.com, fed scramble for hazmat suits, top left-hand corner.
[00:54:47.432 --> 00:54:57.715]  The reason that's important is that Paul, as soon as this article went out, got contacted by a high-level manager of a major shipping company.
[00:54:57.735 --> 00:54:58.735]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:54:59.619 --> 00:55:02.441]  And this is the type of stuff they'll try to hack the site or bring it down over.
[00:55:02.861 --> 00:55:19.433]  That's why we have Facebook, Twitter, and other backup sites like PrisonPlanet.com, and that's why it's important to sign up at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter with your email, so even if they shut down our sites, which they attack us all the time, we can still send you an email that you can repost.
[00:55:21.054 --> 00:55:25.897]  But this is from Paul Joseph Watson to my iPhone ten minutes ago.
[00:55:26.117 --> 00:55:27.058]  UPS manager
[00:55:28.868 --> 00:55:29.949]  I'm not going to give the details.
[00:55:31.049 --> 00:55:39.194]  Sending document, article being written now, up in the next 20 minutes, saying 250,000 hazmat suits are bought by U.S.
[00:55:39.695 --> 00:55:41.776]  government, being sent to Dallas alone.
[00:55:42.837 --> 00:55:45.658]  Now this is national news that the Feds just bought them nationwide.
[00:55:45.979 --> 00:55:47.319]  This is even more they're buying.
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:52.843]  Watson got his photo ID and verified email with the company.
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:56.781]  Doesn't want to be named.
[00:55:57.522 --> 00:56:01.025]  And again, that's just Watson verifying to me, even though he always does, we verify.
[00:56:02.006 --> 00:56:03.307]  Oh, you're a federal marshal, huh?
[00:56:04.868 --> 00:56:11.635]  I'm sorry, you're going to need to mail me your ID and your extension and I'll call you from a secure phone at a set time.
[00:56:11.655 --> 00:56:16.239]  I want to go to the switchboard at the federal building and I want to talk to you.
[00:56:18.638 --> 00:56:20.500]  And Watson's new article just went on screen.
[00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:22.603]  He told me 10 minutes ago, 10 minutes ago, so it's up.
[00:56:22.923 --> 00:56:23.724]  Exclusive, U.F.
[00:56:23.744 --> 00:56:28.430]  government orders 250,000 hazmat suits to be sent to Dallas.
[00:56:29.871 --> 00:56:33.416]  Manager with large shipping company confirms purchase.
[00:56:33.476 --> 00:56:35.138]  Good, Watson didn't say the name of the company.
[00:56:36.408 --> 00:56:38.389]  There's only two, you can guess which one it is.
[00:56:39.189 --> 00:56:43.671]  A manager with a major shipping company has exclusively revealed to InfoWars that the U.S.
[00:56:43.711 --> 00:56:50.534]  government has ordered 20,000 hazmat suits to be sent to Dallas, the location of the latest Ebola outbreak in the United States.
[00:56:50.554 --> 00:57:00.979]  The manager of the shipping company, this is the manager, we shouldn't even say that, provided his credentials to InfoWars by providing a photo ID and sending a verified email from the company account.
[00:57:01.239 --> 00:57:05.581]  The wishes remain anonymous due to understandable fears that he could be fired for revealing the information.
[00:57:06.101 --> 00:57:11.205]  I just learned we have been asked to ship 200,000 hazmat suits to Dallas, Texas for the U.S.
[00:57:11.245 --> 00:57:11.565]  government.
[00:57:11.585 --> 00:57:12.666]  Again, this is happening today.
[00:57:13.106 --> 00:57:15.368]  We are pulling these suits from the U.S.
[00:57:15.869 --> 00:57:18.871]  government to Dallas, Texas.
[00:57:19.652 --> 00:57:23.775]  States, the individual who manages the drivers who work for the shipping company.
[00:57:24.639 --> 00:57:37.343]  The purchase of the quarter of a million hazmat suits to be sent to Dallas confirms the health authorities are still very concerned about the spread of Ebola after two nurses in the city who cared for patient zero, Thomas Eric Duncan, contracted the virus.
[00:57:37.363 --> 00:57:38.884]  And yeah, then one of them flew around everywhere.
[00:57:39.224 --> 00:57:42.045]  Ladies and gentlemen, you better believe if they really had Ebola, they spread it.
[00:57:42.625 --> 00:57:43.626]  I mean, just give me a break.
[00:57:43.826 --> 00:57:44.726]  Let's keep reading the article.
[00:57:48.430 --> 00:58:05.686]  In an interview on the Alex Jones Show last week, Dr. James Lorenzi, who we want to get back on the show, they've totally ostracized him, they haven't fired him yet, revealed that Hospital Corporation of America, a private operator of health facilities, it's the largest, has removed protective gear and hazmat suits from local hospitals without replacing it.
[00:58:06.146 --> 00:58:12.112]  Lorenzi also revealed that the potential cases of Ebola were going unreported and that patients were being, quote, disappeared from hospitals.
[00:58:12.592 --> 00:58:20.758]  As reported earlier, PPE distributor Lakewood Industries announced yesterday that it had received 1 million orders for hazmat suits from the government agencies worldwide.
[00:58:21.338 --> 00:58:26.341]  A press release that prompted the company's stock to soar 30% in the hours after trading.
[00:58:26.361 --> 00:58:27.242]  What did I tell you a month ago?
[00:58:27.262 --> 00:58:31.025]  I didn't buy any of this stock, but it's a sure thing, in my view.
[00:58:31.425 --> 00:58:32.966]  I don't play the stock market, though.
[00:58:33.226 --> 00:58:38.229]  Lakewood initially hit the headlines in September after revealing that it had received an order from the U.S.
[00:58:38.249 --> 00:58:39.210]  State Department for $160,000.
[00:58:40.831 --> 00:58:42.192]  Drudge is linked to our story.
[00:58:42.512 --> 00:58:44.114]  Stay with us, InfoWars.com.
[00:58:44.714 --> 00:58:48.137]  We got Steve Quayle coming up.
[00:58:49.538 --> 00:58:53.701]  They do not like the fact that we can get HUMET intel on everything they're doing from you.
[00:58:53.861 --> 00:58:54.902]  God bless that leaker.
[00:58:56.368 --> 00:58:57.429]  In the near future.
[00:58:57.709 --> 00:59:01.351]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[00:59:01.371 --> 00:59:01.871]  Security alert.
[00:59:02.211 --> 00:59:03.232]  Security alert.
[00:59:03.432 --> 00:59:05.173]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:59:05.453 --> 00:59:06.074]  Analysis.
[00:59:06.334 --> 00:59:06.974]  InfoWars.
[00:59:07.054 --> 00:59:08.995]  Building independent media operations.
[00:59:09.015 --> 00:59:13.998]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:59:14.038 --> 00:59:14.959]  Crime Directive.
[00:59:15.059 --> 00:59:16.520]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:19.402]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:59:19.462 --> 00:59:22.543]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:59:22.704 --> 00:59:24.885]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:59:25.185 --> 00:59:26.506]  People are assaulting us.
[00:59:26.526 --> 00:59:28.807]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:59:29.368 --> 00:59:31.049]  They are never going to stop.
[00:59:31.309 --> 00:59:35.211]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[00:59:38.934 --> 00:59:41.596]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[00:59:42.296 --> 00:59:43.037]  Imperative.
[00:59:43.277 --> 00:59:45.318]  Destroy Little Planet TV.
[00:59:45.338 --> 00:59:49.741]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:59:50.001 --> 00:59:51.362]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[00:59:51.402 --> 00:59:52.142]  You can feel it.
[00:59:57.649 --> 01:00:00.275]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:11.038 --> 01:00:11.678]  Big Brother.
[01:00:12.338 --> 01:00:13.379]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:14.119 --> 01:00:15.199]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:15.859 --> 01:00:16.660]  You want answers?
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:18.400]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.621]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:23.181 --> 01:00:27.282]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.623 --> 01:00:30.683]  Look at these headlines.
[01:00:30.803 --> 01:00:34.484]  Mystery drones breach airspace above French nuke sites.
[01:00:37.465 --> 01:00:40.166]  Brain decoder can eavesdrop on your inner voice.
[01:00:41.653 --> 01:00:43.154]  Carolina vote fraud exposed.
[01:00:43.294 --> 01:00:44.375]  O'Keefe strikes again.
[01:00:45.076 --> 01:00:48.418]  Voters sue Maryland over massive fraud by illegals.
[01:00:49.639 --> 01:00:50.740]  These are headlines on Drudge.
[01:00:51.921 --> 01:00:55.804]  New Hampshire, 71% of new jobs go to foreign-born illegal immigrants.
[01:00:56.725 --> 01:00:59.447]  I tell you, this country is being completely brought down.
[01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:05.113]  CDC Ebola sneeze warning.
[01:01:05.433 --> 01:01:06.794]  They admit it could be spread to the air.
[01:01:07.194 --> 01:01:08.815]  Feds scramble for hazmat suits.
[01:01:08.835 --> 01:01:18.280]  See, they're getting ready to, after the election, I think more and more it's becoming clear, to then let people know that Ebola's spreading.
[01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:20.881]  They're just pushing it till next week.
[01:01:25.464 --> 01:01:29.726]  So I guess, you know, get ready Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, we'll start hearing about the new Ebola cases next week.
[01:01:30.246 --> 01:01:31.607]  In fact, that's what's happening.
[01:01:32.631 --> 01:01:41.035]  And it looks like Obama's getting us ready for it, saying in a speech, we played the clip earlier, let's cue that back up, Americans may still see some Ebola cases.
[01:01:41.535 --> 01:01:43.235]  Obama says, but it's no big deal.
[01:01:44.156 --> 01:01:54.300]  And there's 250,000 hazmat suits on top of the millions that are being sent to different agencies that are being ordered by the CDC to Dallas right now. 250,000!
[01:02:02.588 --> 01:02:03.229]  Did you hear, Mitt?
[01:02:06.713 --> 01:02:07.735]  Did you hear what I just said?
[01:02:09.677 --> 01:02:11.900]  That's up on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:02:12.621 --> 01:02:14.383]  And by the way, get them to red-link all this.
[01:02:15.224 --> 01:02:20.551]  I think Watson can add my statement in there that this more and more leans towards very strong indicators.
[01:02:21.525 --> 01:02:23.126]  That they know it's spreading.
[01:02:23.146 --> 01:02:24.046]  They've been covering it up.
[01:02:24.127 --> 01:02:25.047]  I don't know how bad.
[01:02:25.567 --> 01:02:27.729]  They knew their policies would cause it to spread.
[01:02:27.749 --> 01:02:32.171]  And they're just getting everybody ready with Obama's statement and these hazmat suits.
[01:02:33.272 --> 01:02:34.712]  This doesn't look good.
[01:02:34.813 --> 01:02:35.533]  I'm in Texas.
[01:02:35.713 --> 01:02:37.594]  I am three and a half hours away.
[01:02:37.634 --> 01:02:38.795]  I got family in Dallas.
[01:02:40.896 --> 01:02:42.057]  I am so sick of this.
[01:02:43.437 --> 01:02:44.498]  I am so tired of it.
[01:02:44.738 --> 01:02:49.421]  And then as soon as that new czar got in, he's a media controller, a spin doctor.
[01:02:50.370 --> 01:02:51.710]  That's why there was never press conferences.
[01:02:51.751 --> 01:03:00.814]  They just shut everything down, put the spin out, it was no big deal, to kill it as an election issue so they can push the vaccines and the police state after.
[01:03:00.994 --> 01:03:09.137]  And Obama can use that as a smokescreen for executive power to then sign his amnesty plan, shut down the power plants, launch all the new wars.
[01:03:09.237 --> 01:03:12.038]  I mean, as soon as this is over and he's a lame duck,
[01:03:13.556 --> 01:03:26.030]  As soon as this election's over, and they've tried to steal it or whatever they're up to, I mean, you can just feel the hammer of doom, the sword of Damocles above our heads.
[01:03:27.152 --> 01:03:31.276]  My spider sense on a scale of 1 to 10, it's never been above a 6 or a 7.
[01:03:31.337 --> 01:03:34.080]  Then it's right up there at about a 9 right now.
[01:03:39.810 --> 01:03:43.752]  And the public can't find their butt with both hands on average, I mean.
[01:03:44.212 --> 01:03:49.235]  And the government's run by a bunch of lying crooks that smoke their own dope, believe their own baloney.
[01:03:50.215 --> 01:03:52.917]  What a scenario for disaster.
[01:03:55.083 --> 01:03:57.925]  See, it's not that I'm that scared of a few Ebola cases if they contained them.
[01:03:58.265 --> 01:04:13.196]  It's that they're not containing them, the way they're acting, Bill Gates involved with these bases in Africa, NSA, CIA, Pentagon, military, virologists, top lawyers that wrote the Bioweapons Treaty, all saying the fix is in, it's staged.
[01:04:13.817 --> 01:04:15.858]  All saying that it was cooked up in U.S.
[01:04:15.918 --> 01:04:22.543]  labs, naming Galveston, and the New York Times goes, oh, we happen to have the vaccine for the exact mutation before it happened.
[01:04:22.743 --> 01:04:23.744]  That's impossible!
[01:04:27.793 --> 01:04:28.636]  The fix is in.
[01:04:28.656 --> 01:04:31.204]  I don't know exactly what they're going to pull.
[01:04:31.224 --> 01:04:33.732]  I don't know what's coming through that door.
[01:04:34.622 --> 01:04:38.605]  But I hear the drums, and I hear the snarls, just like Gandalf, use that analogy.
[01:04:39.205 --> 01:04:40.206]  Drums, drums in the deep.
[01:04:40.486 --> 01:04:41.026]  They are coming.
[01:04:41.346 --> 01:05:02.300]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
[01:05:05.424 --> 01:05:08.907]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:05:09.067 --> 01:05:13.030]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:14.811]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:05:15.131 --> 01:05:22.717]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:05:22.997 --> 01:05:23.838]  But for how long?
[01:05:24.138 --> 01:05:30.402]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:05:30.783 --> 01:05:33.585]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:05:35.066 --> 01:05:45.270]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:51.673]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:05:52.073 --> 01:05:54.314]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:05:54.414 --> 01:05:57.475]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[01:05:57.515 --> 01:06:04.398]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[01:06:04.858 --> 01:06:06.079]  Another major health threat.
[01:06:06.119 --> 01:06:11.003]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:06:11.083 --> 01:06:13.725]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:06:13.765 --> 01:06:20.550]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:23.692]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:06:23.812 --> 01:06:26.734]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:06:26.754 --> 01:06:28.756]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:06:28.776 --> 01:06:31.618]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:06:31.698 --> 01:06:37.200]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:40.901]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:06:40.921 --> 01:06:43.922]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:06:43.942 --> 01:06:48.284]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have.
[01:06:48.444 --> 01:06:51.108]  For every modern independently minded household.

[01:07:05.866 --> 01:07:12.849]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[01:07:12.989 --> 01:07:19.232]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:19.252 --> 01:07:26.895]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula, coming from a deep-earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[01:07:27.196 --> 01:07:32.238]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[01:07:32.498 --> 01:07:33.418]  Not our iodine.
[01:07:33.518 --> 01:07:37.100]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:39.681]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:02.391]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:02.591 --> 01:08:08.513]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:30.223]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:08:30.403 --> 01:08:31.504]  until 2 p.m.
[01:08:31.544 --> 01:08:34.727]  Central we're here live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:08:34.907 --> 01:08:39.151]  I am your host Alex Jones coming to you from Austin, Texas.
[01:08:43.191 --> 01:09:04.558]  Steve Quayle, syndicated radio host, best-selling author, survivalist, who's been coming on the broadcast for 18 years, joins us for the next two hours for the balance of the transmission to talk about the big picture, the technocracy, the transhumanist, the globalist master plan, why they're suddenly announcing, oh, in 10 years you won't be allowed to drive your car, everything will be driverless.
[01:09:06.738 --> 01:09:16.788]  Continuing to demonize and dehumanize humanity, telling us that, oh, it's okay to put troops on death list and not give them treatment, it's okay to have death panels.
[01:09:17.549 --> 01:09:24.356]  Oh, trending, more college students support post-birth abortion, killing babies up to age five or children.
[01:09:25.056 --> 01:09:30.462]  This is all being calmly reported to just condition you to accept anything.
[01:09:31.821 --> 01:09:37.742]  The White House has now come out, and we told you this was coming, this is out of the hill, and said they're going to kill the password.
[01:09:39.942 --> 01:09:47.444]  The password, from all the IT people I've talked to, is one of the best ways to protect yourself if you make it complex and change it frequently.
[01:09:48.644 --> 01:09:56.145]  It is biometrics that can be hacked because they simply hack the code key, which is a password itself to the algorithm.
[01:09:58.366 --> 01:09:59.526]  We talked to the top hackers.
[01:10:01.272 --> 01:10:03.853]  Microsoft wants you to go to biometrics.
[01:10:03.873 --> 01:10:09.236]  That's why all their new software coming out in the last few years, and Apple's doing it, and everybody else is biometric.
[01:10:09.917 --> 01:10:13.799]  Then that's going to be compromised, and they're going to move to in-the-body chip.
[01:10:14.399 --> 01:10:18.602]  I just said this two days ago, and now it's in the news.
[01:10:20.223 --> 01:10:22.424]  In the article, they don't even say what they're going to replace it with.
[01:10:22.444 --> 01:10:24.145]  They just say some other exciting technologies.
[01:10:24.645 --> 01:10:27.947]  It's biometric, retina scan, thumbprint, or index finger.
[01:10:29.062 --> 01:10:32.665]  Or voice print, and that's all very easy to compromise.
[01:10:33.206 --> 01:10:39.632]  The password is still the best system, and that's why they're moving to get rid of it.
[01:10:39.892 --> 01:10:51.322]  This is just one little micron in the overall pantheon, or cornucopia, or sea, or ocean, or universe of things they're moving on.
[01:10:52.065 --> 01:10:55.647]  The average person would read this and go, oh, the White House cares about my security.
[01:10:56.387 --> 01:11:01.890]  It's been Bank of America and Chase and Walmart and Target and Apple.
[01:11:03.031 --> 01:11:05.032]  They're the ones that compromised the cloud.
[01:11:05.092 --> 01:11:07.233]  They're the ones that compromised the loyalty card.
[01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:12.556]  They're the ones, you know, tens of millions of people, social security numbers and bank account info, Bank of America.
[01:11:12.876 --> 01:11:14.357]  It's dumped out on purpose.
[01:11:16.478 --> 01:11:20.120]  The system's designed to be compromised to force you into total control.
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:21.401]  I've been saying that for a decade.
[01:11:23.797 --> 01:11:32.580]  They're bringing down the old web that's really the new expanding free web to bring in the new web 2.0, the smart web that's really the slave web.
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:35.961]  Now here's the bombshell breaking news.
[01:11:36.001 --> 01:11:46.164]  I'm not going to say if it's UPS or whether it's FedEx or whether it's DHL, but it's one of the biggest, one of the big three.
[01:11:46.184 --> 01:11:53.226]  I'm not going to say their colors blue, brown or yellow, but a manager
[01:11:55.277 --> 01:12:06.968]  With one of those major companies is currently shipping today, the order came in yesterday, 250,000 hazmat suits to Dallas, Texas alone.
[01:12:07.789 --> 01:12:10.411]  That is a massive order of the spacesuits.
[01:12:11.993 --> 01:12:12.994]  Exclusive U.S.
[01:12:13.014 --> 01:12:15.896]  government order, 250,000 hazmat suits to be sent to Dallas.
[01:12:16.377 --> 01:12:18.599]  Manager with large shipping company confirms purchase.
[01:12:20.216 --> 01:12:24.459]  And we got his email, his ID, his name, and contacted him back at the company.
[01:12:24.819 --> 01:12:30.022]  This is a manager for preservation of themselves and their family.
[01:12:30.042 --> 01:12:39.929]  They're telling us it's just like medical doctors have gone on and off record, and Border Patrol has gone on record by name that months ago they were grabbing people that they thought had Ebola and disappearing it.
[01:12:40.129 --> 01:12:42.110]  And the Border Patrol said, you're supposed to fill out this paperwork.
[01:12:42.410 --> 01:12:44.772]  And they said, hey, sit down and shut up.
[01:12:45.212 --> 01:12:46.433]  This is COG.
[01:12:46.813 --> 01:12:47.894]  Martial law, bud.
[01:12:50.094 --> 01:12:51.856]  Why then would they bring in Ebola patients?
[01:12:51.956 --> 01:12:53.777]  Why would they tell the nurse go ahead and fly?
[01:12:53.837 --> 01:12:56.339]  Why would they let this doctor go to bowling alleys when he was sick?
[01:12:56.399 --> 01:13:02.625]  And to the most busy subway, A-Line, and to restaurants and taxis.
[01:13:03.445 --> 01:13:09.030]  And now it's in mainstream news that he lied and knew he was sick and went all these places, credit card records show.
[01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:12.413]  Who is this nurse that works for the CDC that refuses to quarantine?
[01:13:12.713 --> 01:13:13.594]  Who are these people?
[01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:16.799]  Who are they?
[01:13:17.599 --> 01:13:20.642]  Well, they're a bunch of people that work for Al Gore and Doctors Without Borders.
[01:13:20.923 --> 01:13:33.094]  The head czar, who tells us everything's fine, told the media to shut up last week, and they dutifully did what they were told, has been on record saying there are too many people in Africa.
[01:13:33.134 --> 01:13:34.255]  That's his main focus.
[01:13:34.716 --> 01:13:39.060]  And he works for Al Gore and is a transhumanist eugenicist, in my view.
[01:13:40.882 --> 01:13:43.664]  Daily Mail, New York Ebola doctor lied to police about his travel.
[01:13:44.124 --> 01:13:49.487]  NYPD discovered he rode subway, ate at restaurant, and went bowling after cops checked his MetroCard.
[01:13:49.748 --> 01:13:51.409]  And we first reported this last week.
[01:13:53.450 --> 01:13:54.991]  When it first broke over the weekend.
[01:13:55.551 --> 01:13:57.432]  And they said, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[01:13:57.452 --> 01:13:59.434]  The cops aren't in on an on average.
[01:13:59.894 --> 01:14:00.814]  They're compartmentalized.
[01:14:00.834 --> 01:14:01.875]  They went and checked his records.
[01:14:02.095 --> 01:14:02.896]  He's a liar!
[01:14:03.596 --> 01:14:04.637]  What's going on here?
[01:14:06.678 --> 01:14:12.522]  So you add that with our other story that's on DrudgeReport.com, linked up in the left-hand corner.
[01:14:14.143 --> 01:14:19.207]  Government agencies scramble to purchase hazmat suits.
[01:14:19.367 --> 01:14:23.610]  Order from one company surpasses $1 million as concerns about Ebola linger.
[01:14:24.511 --> 01:14:26.352]  And now, I want to play this clip and go to Steve Quayle.
[01:14:26.372 --> 01:14:29.394]  When I saw this at about 6.30 a.m.
[01:14:29.434 --> 01:14:31.656]  when I got up and got in front of the computer,
[01:14:32.711 --> 01:14:34.752]  The NSA surveillance terminal is what it really is.
[01:14:35.172 --> 01:14:36.332]  Dialing into the DARPA grid.
[01:14:37.273 --> 01:14:38.593]  Into the proto-matrix.
[01:14:39.954 --> 01:14:42.235]  Americans may still see some Ebola cases.
[01:14:42.695 --> 01:14:43.055]  Reuters.
[01:14:43.775 --> 01:14:44.596]  So that's them.
[01:14:45.696 --> 01:14:47.797]  So they don't get blamed for being blindsided too much.
[01:14:47.817 --> 01:14:50.998]  They'll say, I told you before the election there might be some more.
[01:14:51.018 --> 01:14:52.739]  And I think they're getting people ready.
[01:14:52.779 --> 01:14:53.679]  Now I hope I'm wrong.
[01:14:54.119 --> 01:14:54.919]  Is it really Ebola?
[01:14:54.999 --> 01:14:55.920]  Is it some other simulant?
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:12.383]  We've had CIA people, NSA people, top lawyers that wrote the treaties and the laws, like Dr. Boyle, say they believe it is some type of simulant of a dialed-down Ebola, but it's more airborne, so it's worse in ways, that's being used.
[01:15:12.443 --> 01:15:25.465]  And Boyle pointed out that they say University of Texas BioShield, federal contracts, developed this a year ago and has the vaccine now being developed, guessing the mutation, which is impossible.
[01:15:27.489 --> 01:15:31.431]  By the way, now the CDC came out and said it is airborne.
[01:15:31.771 --> 01:15:32.891]  It can spread by sneezing.
[01:15:35.272 --> 01:15:42.295]  So we now take you to Steve Quayle of SteveQuayle.com to give us his analysis with this new intel of what this means.
[01:15:42.335 --> 01:15:45.896]  Steve, to me it looks like they're getting people ready for more cases.
[01:15:46.176 --> 01:15:47.577]  We know they're disappearing people.
[01:15:48.337 --> 01:15:49.517]  We haven't talked in two days.
[01:15:49.777 --> 01:15:50.758]  What's your latest intel?
[01:15:51.817 --> 01:15:55.167]  I think it's very succinct in what you just said, Alex, when you ran through.
[01:16:01.169 --> 01:16:01.669]  I think so.
[01:16:22.748 --> 01:16:23.889]  I see that.
[01:16:45.069 --> 01:16:52.433]  This is the insurance actuaries, and the insurance companies are now quietly changing people's policies and notifying them they won't cover Ebola.
[01:16:52.673 --> 01:16:55.275]  They wouldn't be doing that if they weren't concerned.
[01:16:55.655 --> 01:17:02.079]  And when you talk about Texas being under attack, won't give us the federal funds that we paid in taxes for the wildfires.
[01:17:02.819 --> 01:17:06.161]  Won't, shutting down the majority of power plants is in Texas.
[01:17:07.122 --> 01:17:08.323]  I could go through the whole list.
[01:17:08.783 --> 01:17:11.705]  Not opening the border in California, but opening the border here.
[01:17:12.065 --> 01:17:13.866]  They are bombarding Texas.
[01:17:14.648 --> 01:17:15.391]  Absolutely.
[01:17:15.733 --> 01:17:19.287]  Now I want to make it clear to everybody, and Alex has got it and you can put it up.
[01:17:23.063 --> 01:17:23.803]  We're good to go.
[01:17:49.585 --> 01:17:58.511]  And you just quoted from the group even above Bilderberg, they call it the first global revolution in the public paper, where they say humanity is the enemy.
[01:17:58.892 --> 01:18:06.077]  Organizing everything around humans being bad, humans being ugly, humans being scum, with the elite and the robots exterminating us.
[01:18:08.158 --> 01:18:12.620]  I've come a long way, just quickly, and you and I started on Talk Ready Together, what, 18 years ago?
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:15.421]  Not started, but that was the first time I came on with you.
[01:18:15.461 --> 01:18:16.802]  I think I've been on 23 years.
[01:18:17.362 --> 01:18:19.723]  I tried to get people then to understand.
[01:18:19.743 --> 01:18:28.206]  When I wrote the book, Genetic Armageddon, the whole basis was the fact that these people hate humanity, and I believe that's because they're all devils and fallen angels.
[01:18:28.226 --> 01:18:29.927]  No apologies for that statement.
[01:18:30.487 --> 01:18:34.690]  The point is, genetic Armageddon, I said, today's technology, tomorrow's monsters.
[01:18:35.290 --> 01:18:47.017]  Well, the last book I've written to date that's critical and I guess is my swan song for this whole statement on transhumanism, and it's important people understand this, is Xenogenesis.
[01:18:47.037 --> 01:18:59.324]  When you and I tell all these facts, figures, quote all the different newspapers, all the different sources, it doesn't matter if it's doctors, intelligence agents, military, the bottom line at the end of the day, at the end of your show today is,
[01:18:59.804 --> 01:19:03.947]  These people have set in plan a motion to destroy us, and I want to share something.
[01:19:04.448 --> 01:19:22.422]  Every now and then, you know, people get it, but what they don't understand is if you've got a child right now, you know, Alex, I've got like five kids and let's see, four grandchildren, and they're telling me in this report that you have that basically my kids and grandkids are dead by 2025.
[01:19:22.462 --> 01:19:27.086]  They're saying 85 to 90% of your family will be murdered by them.
[01:19:27.729 --> 01:19:28.492]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:19:28.793 --> 01:19:31.706]  So, ladies and gentlemen, every now and then something
[01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:46.762]  That's right.
[01:19:46.802 --> 01:19:47.842]  Stay there when we come back.
[01:19:48.563 --> 01:19:49.423]  This is so important.
[01:19:49.443 --> 01:19:50.483]  This is the master plan.
[01:19:50.904 --> 01:19:52.384]  This is why this stuff's happening.
[01:19:52.424 --> 01:19:55.565]  The globalists have set their plan in thousands of documents.
[01:19:55.605 --> 01:19:59.167]  I want to come back with that Club of Rome document again and read that quote.
[01:19:59.847 --> 01:20:00.827]  This is the library.
[01:20:00.907 --> 01:20:02.448]  I went and got this at the library 15 years ago.
[01:20:02.468 --> 01:20:03.008]  I didn't believe it.
[01:20:05.012 --> 01:20:07.593]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.

[01:23:33.547 --> 01:23:34.768]  I love a dark house.

[01:24:00.965 --> 01:24:02.126]  The Burglar Deterrent.
[01:24:13.436 --> 01:24:20.523]  By the way, in a few minutes we're going to tweet the link out at Real Alex Jones from the 1991 Club of Rome document.
[01:24:24.107 --> 01:24:32.574]  That itself was a, declassified by the private group, 1966 minutes of a meeting, codified.
[01:24:32.634 --> 01:24:34.116]  And I've read the entire document.
[01:24:35.116 --> 01:24:36.818]  We'll go over some of it right now.
[01:24:36.878 --> 01:24:38.199]  This is just one document.
[01:24:38.579 --> 01:24:40.821]  In fact, you'll see screenshots of it in my film, Endgame.
[01:24:41.402 --> 01:24:42.943]  Blueprint for Global Enslavement, 2007.
[01:24:44.524 --> 01:24:48.488]  The reason we know what they're going to do, and people are amazed by it,
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:57.282]  Or they're frightened by it, or they say, oh, we must be crazy and won't check into it, is because they all write books and white papers saying it.
[01:24:58.262 --> 01:25:04.903]  I've got bookshelves with hundreds of books in my office where they just admit the plan for world government.
[01:25:05.243 --> 01:25:07.384]  Men in Power is a political retrospective.
[01:25:08.044 --> 01:25:09.664]  Superclass by Rothkopf.
[01:25:10.025 --> 01:25:11.705]  The Anglo-American Establishment.
[01:25:12.305 --> 01:25:12.825]  Quigley.
[01:25:13.725 --> 01:25:14.846]  Between Two Ages.
[01:25:15.446 --> 01:25:16.486]  The Brzezinski books.
[01:25:18.092 --> 01:25:22.955]  And then I see them write stuff 50 years ago, 40 years ago, 30 years ago, and you know what?
[01:25:23.015 --> 01:25:25.397]  I'm now living it!
[01:25:25.417 --> 01:25:28.959]  20 years ago, they said we're going to put boxes in all the cars and tax you by the mile.
[01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:31.181]  10 years ago, the boxes went in.
[01:25:31.741 --> 01:25:33.743]  Now they're announcing they're going to start the taxing!
[01:25:34.023 --> 01:25:36.765]  The pilot program's going in Austin, where I live!
[01:25:39.721 --> 01:25:40.342]  You understand?
[01:25:40.382 --> 01:25:43.504]  That's what's so frustrating, is 95% of this is public.
[01:25:44.065 --> 01:26:04.682]  Steve Quayle's a short segment, I'll give you the floor, but when you start bringing up these quotes, and I'd even forgotten about that Club of Rome document, 1991, the first global revolution, give people the page number, we'll put it on screen from the PDF for TV viewers, of where they say they're going to organize a global government around making humanity the enemy, page 75,
[01:26:06.945 --> 01:26:09.868]  Of the common enemy of humanity is man.
[01:26:10.489 --> 01:26:11.831]  Let's read this paragraph.
[01:26:13.934 --> 01:26:14.515]  Steve Quayle.
[01:26:15.046 --> 01:26:16.067]  You want me to read it, Alex?
[01:26:16.207 --> 01:26:17.047]  Or I can, sure.
[01:26:17.348 --> 01:26:17.988]  Yeah, I'll read it.
[01:26:18.368 --> 01:26:27.695]  In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine, and the like would fit the bill.
[01:26:27.855 --> 01:26:34.900]  All these dangers are caused by human intervention, and it's only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome.
[01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:37.161]  The real enemy then is humanity itself.
[01:26:37.361 --> 01:26:42.405]  These people hate mankind, so if these are the people, and I believe they're inspired by the
[01:26:42.865 --> 01:26:43.366]  We're good.
[01:27:00.882 --> 01:27:02.603]  The point being is this.
[01:27:03.023 --> 01:27:11.188]  That means all your future, all your hopes, all your dreams, your children's future, this has to be foremost in everyone's thoughts.
[01:27:11.228 --> 01:27:13.490]  And Alex, again, these are transhumanists.
[01:27:13.730 --> 01:27:14.870]  They hate humanity.
[01:27:15.131 --> 01:27:22.395]  So when we talk about human attenuation, look, I wrote, and I want to share this, the book I wrote, Xenogenesis, is the most concise, precise,
[01:27:23.095 --> 01:27:28.758]  In my opinion, and the opinion of people all over the world, it has been so succinct and nailing.
[01:27:29.038 --> 01:27:30.199]  Hear what's happening.
[01:27:30.339 --> 01:27:33.920]  Anybody who's left alive that's a human will become a techno-serf.
[01:27:34.221 --> 01:27:36.262]  T-E-C-H-N-O-serf.
[01:27:36.342 --> 01:27:39.303]  I coined the term techno-serfdom 20 years ago.
[01:27:39.603 --> 01:27:49.208]  So the point that you and I are making, and God bless Texas, I mean that with all my heart, I pray that the Texans will wake up and understand, if I was told that I got 250,000
[01:27:51.889 --> 01:27:52.549]  We're good to go.
[01:28:12.535 --> 01:28:22.642]  The absolute spirit of Texas, the spirit of this country is exemplified, and I still don't understand how you get some of the governors you get, but that's another point.
[01:28:22.662 --> 01:28:34.470]  But the point being is in the Illuminist mind, that word liberty must be destroyed at all costs, and that's why it's a full court press on the state of Texas.
[01:28:34.771 --> 01:28:41.135]  So when we're talking about these people hate humanity, if you want to understand it, and look,
[01:28:41.815 --> 01:28:43.455]  And they know where the resistance is coming from.
[01:28:43.496 --> 01:28:47.216]  They say that in their white papers that they have to crush Texas as the model.
[01:28:47.236 --> 01:28:58.419]  And in all their actuaries they see a resistance rising up in official Pentagon documents and surrounding states going with Texas and forming a new country in an attempt at a UN takeover.
[01:28:58.619 --> 01:29:04.020]  They've already war game the plans to attack us and they know the military will end up joining Texas.
[01:29:04.875 --> 01:29:05.615]  Well, and that's true.
[01:29:05.675 --> 01:29:07.677]  And by the way, I was privy to the conversation.
[01:29:08.017 --> 01:29:15.120]  Everybody looks at the Bunker Hunt, Nelson Hunt, and, you know, some other Texas wealthy people that they were just trying to corner the silver market.
[01:29:15.181 --> 01:29:16.621]  That was not the real story.
[01:29:17.062 --> 01:29:28.127]  One of the most wealthy men in Texas, I will not use his name, told me face-to-face almost a decade ago, he said, Steve, the real reason that was being done behind the scenes so that we could come up with our own currency.
[01:29:28.268 --> 01:29:28.748]  No, I know.
[01:29:28.808 --> 01:29:29.888]  In fact, he worked with the Hunts.
[01:29:29.928 --> 01:29:31.489]  He's basically a billionaire.
[01:29:31.509 --> 01:29:32.610]  You're talking about the guy out of Houston?
[01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:39.114]  Well, this one was out of Dallas, but trust me, billionaire with enough zeros, and you'd know his name.
[01:29:39.454 --> 01:29:42.657]  Very famous in the... Yeah, one of the hunts just died last week.
[01:29:42.897 --> 01:29:43.697]  Hey, stay there.
[01:29:43.877 --> 01:29:44.778]  This is so key.
[01:29:45.098 --> 01:29:45.939]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:46.059 --> 01:29:50.282]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, SteenQuell.com.
[01:29:50.622 --> 01:29:51.402]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:51.443 --> 01:29:51.903]  Stay with us.
[01:29:54.144 --> 01:29:55.045]  We're on the march.
[01:29:55.525 --> 01:29:57.126]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:58.067 --> 01:30:00.749]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:05.410 --> 01:30:14.937]  Using unparalleled research and the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:30:15.077 --> 01:30:24.824]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:30:25.004 --> 01:30:27.906]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[01:30:28.046 --> 01:30:28.306]  I think so.
[01:30:43.083 --> 01:30:43.343]  We're good.
[01:31:05.916 --> 01:31:11.299]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:31:12.579 --> 01:31:17.341]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:31:17.722 --> 01:31:24.265]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:31:26.446 --> 01:31:29.547]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:31:29.567 --> 01:31:32.649]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:31:44.598 --> 01:31:46.479]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:31:46.739 --> 01:31:48.259]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:31:48.519 --> 01:31:51.080]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:55.441]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[01:31:55.461 --> 01:31:57.662]  So you can ride all day with confidence.

[01:32:00.743 --> 01:32:02.163]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:32:02.323 --> 01:32:02.763]  Got it.
[01:32:03.104 --> 01:32:03.924]  Others don't.
[01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:06.881]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[01:32:07.201 --> 01:32:11.002]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[01:32:11.723 --> 01:32:16.064]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[01:32:16.204 --> 01:32:22.987]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[01:32:23.507 --> 01:32:32.591]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:32:32.791 --> 01:32:38.214]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[01:32:38.354 --> 01:32:45.598]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.
[01:32:45.939 --> 01:32:48.220]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:53.643]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.

[01:33:07.114 --> 01:33:08.595]  We are on the march.
[01:33:08.935 --> 01:33:11.357]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:33:12.078 --> 01:33:15.741]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:21.162 --> 01:33:25.165]  Reflecting on my past life.
[01:33:25.245 --> 01:33:27.746]  Because at 5 o'clock.
[01:33:49.992 --> 01:34:02.023]  The sands of time.
[01:34:02.223 --> 01:34:03.424]  Face the tyranny.
[01:34:03.564 --> 01:34:04.585]  Face the threat.
[01:34:04.705 --> 01:34:06.707]  Face the fear and defeat it.
[01:34:06.787 --> 01:34:09.109]  Deny it out of cowardice.
[01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:10.591]  It will conquer us.
[01:34:10.971 --> 01:34:13.273]  Not just physically, but with its madness.
[01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:20.261]  Whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad.
[01:34:20.501 --> 01:34:25.683]  That was first spoken by Prometheus in Henry Wadsworth's Longfellow's poem.
[01:34:31.724 --> 01:34:33.125]  The Mask of Pandora.
[01:34:36.265 --> 01:34:39.486]  Whom the gods would destroy, they would first make mad.
[01:34:41.267 --> 01:34:42.507]  It's how the gods kill.
[01:34:43.837 --> 01:34:46.118]  And you can see that now unfolding here today.
[01:34:46.158 --> 01:34:50.179]  We're going right back to Steve Quayle.
[01:34:50.539 --> 01:34:57.082]  And that's why, when Steve Quayle gets on, I get real excited and start jumping in and start getting upset.
[01:34:57.842 --> 01:35:01.904]  Because, I say, globalist documents state they want to reduce population by 90%.
[01:35:03.353 --> 01:35:07.414]  You know, they're on record saying that we're the main enemy in their organizing society around destroying us.
[01:35:08.135 --> 01:35:10.075]  But see, Steve Quell comes on and he gives a source.
[01:35:10.715 --> 01:35:20.759]  And I do that a lot too, but then I just start remembering that document and hundreds of others, and my brain just explodes with the frustration that we're not making this stuff up, people!
[01:35:21.959 --> 01:35:25.120]  And this is what I want to say, and I want to get Steve Quell's take on this.
[01:35:27.641 --> 01:35:32.603]  After I talk about an important issue, I want to be thinking about this.
[01:35:33.872 --> 01:35:44.357]  Imagine if there was a 25-year-old guy in town, in your town, who started writing books about how he wanted to kill 90% of the people in the town.
[01:35:45.698 --> 01:35:50.200]  You'd start watching him, you'd start getting concerned about him, and when he took a wrong step, you know, he'd be in jail.
[01:35:52.261 --> 01:35:55.023]  Or the police would talk to him and say, are you planning to really kill somebody?
[01:35:55.828 --> 01:35:58.429]  Because that's premeditated and we're going to go ahead and slap you in jail right now.
[01:35:59.109 --> 01:36:15.996]  You have David Rockefeller, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Henry Kissinger, the head of Pepsi, the Chinese Communist government, Charlie Rose, basically every globalist you can imagine, talking about the big endgame being world population reduction of 90%.
[01:36:16.036 --> 01:36:16.416]  Prince Philip,
[01:36:19.642 --> 01:36:29.651]  I say Ted Turner, Prince Charles, the Dutch Queen, Beatrix, her son, just you name it, Dr. Pianka, all of them.
[01:36:31.713 --> 01:36:33.955]  You don't get in the club unless you're in this religion.
[01:36:34.436 --> 01:36:40.201]  See, I study the religion of my captors, basically, that are trying to shut down my freedom.
[01:36:40.381 --> 01:36:44.025]  But they don't want to make it too obvious because they want everybody to stay asleep.
[01:36:45.094 --> 01:36:47.258]  I'm jumping up and down saying you better get awake to this.
[01:36:47.539 --> 01:36:49.402]  They have all said their plan.
[01:36:49.643 --> 01:36:50.163]  And you know what?
[01:36:50.204 --> 01:36:53.750]  They're about 5, 6, 7 years behind some parts of the plan.
[01:36:53.950 --> 01:36:55.353]  They're 20 years behind on other parts.
[01:36:55.553 --> 01:36:56.735]  They're ahead on some parts.
[01:36:58.331 --> 01:37:01.072]  In my view, that's a good question to ask Quill, what does he think their plan is?
[01:37:01.732 --> 01:37:07.414]  But here's the issue, they are guided by a dark dream of mass death, and then they merge with machines.
[01:37:08.175 --> 01:37:11.436]  Their God has told them, whether you believe that or not, they write about it.
[01:37:11.796 --> 01:37:14.937]  How Lucifer is their God, and the Earth First Battalion and the Pentagon.
[01:37:15.818 --> 01:37:24.441]  That's what Men Who Tears Up Goats comes out of, and General Stubblebine, I'm not saying he was in, he ran that, but I think he's a good guy overall, but we've had the Major General on.
[01:37:25.692 --> 01:37:31.836]  And in those battalions, they said, we are the horsemen death, riding for Lucifer, one world government to carry out the plan of Club of Rome.
[01:37:32.236 --> 01:37:33.216]  I have that manual.
[01:37:33.256 --> 01:37:38.519]  Tex Mars got one of the only copies from the Department of Defense, listed, classified.
[01:37:40.801 --> 01:37:42.062]  He was a captain in the Air Force.
[01:37:42.722 --> 01:37:44.023]  And he's a space and aeronautics professor.
[01:37:44.043 --> 01:37:46.804]  People just think he's a guy that writes, you know, books about the New World Order.
[01:37:47.965 --> 01:37:51.247]  When you know all this information, you know this is the plan.
[01:37:53.677 --> 01:37:55.098]  And then I think about how long I've been on air.
[01:37:55.118 --> 01:37:55.798]  20 years.
[01:37:56.759 --> 01:37:59.080]  And they'll play an intro that McBreen made with Charlton Heston in it.
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:37:59.941]  I knew Charlton Heston.
[01:38:01.222 --> 01:38:02.302]  I know Major Stubblebine.
[01:38:02.362 --> 01:38:07.725]  I know, and I'm not bragging, I know Dr. Frederick Whitehurst, the head of the crime lab that exposed the FBI fraud.
[01:38:08.246 --> 01:38:09.326]  I knew Gary Webb.
[01:38:09.406 --> 01:38:21.614]  It's just when you do this talk show focused for 20 years, and you know everybody from Steve Quayle to George Norrie, from Ron Paul to Rand Paul, and you've got all this data, I don't think the average person in government
[01:38:22.803 --> 01:38:24.245]  ...is doing this much research.
[01:38:24.285 --> 01:38:25.305]  They're compartmentalized.
[01:38:25.486 --> 01:38:28.208]  Only the Illuminists are doing it, and they're from their perspective.
[01:38:28.288 --> 01:38:33.092]  We're doing the perspective research, from our perspective, of loving humanity, wanting to build humanity.
[01:38:33.613 --> 01:38:36.275]  But in a way, you stare into the abyss, you become the abyss.
[01:38:36.335 --> 01:38:39.398]  As Nietzsche said, I know their plan.
[01:38:39.618 --> 01:38:43.642]  I live it by studying it, and I'm so close to them.
[01:38:45.012 --> 01:38:45.832]  I don't love them.
[01:38:46.353 --> 01:38:46.993]  I detest them.
[01:38:47.313 --> 01:38:53.436]  They have the quote in Ender's Game when you study an enemy so long you know them and then you love them.
[01:38:53.837 --> 01:38:55.077]  No, you don't love them.
[01:38:57.459 --> 01:39:01.581]  You're seeing manifest pit of hell
[01:39:02.853 --> 01:39:05.555]  Eighth Dimension, whatever you want to call it, demon forces.
[01:39:06.035 --> 01:39:07.496]  And that's what Steve Quill gets into.
[01:39:07.736 --> 01:39:14.981]  When you finally get to the bottom of the rabbit hole, you realize that the only thing that makes sense is that it's like an extraterrestrial operation against us.
[01:39:15.661 --> 01:39:16.902]  I'm just going to come right out with it.
[01:39:16.942 --> 01:39:17.803]  And I love God.
[01:39:17.883 --> 01:39:18.864]  It's the Christian perspective.
[01:39:19.124 --> 01:39:20.064]  It all fits right there.
[01:39:20.925 --> 01:39:23.186]  That this is a master diabolical plan.
[01:39:23.427 --> 01:39:26.308]  But God says we can beat it if we have knowledge.
[01:39:26.329 --> 01:39:29.851]  We perish for lack of knowledge if we understand the mass deception.
[01:39:31.291 --> 01:39:36.992]  Because they're offering the Illuminati eternal life through computers, but first they gotta kill us?
[01:39:37.012 --> 01:39:39.513]  Because they gotta save the Earth?
[01:39:39.573 --> 01:39:43.194]  But then meanwhile they're doing GMO and all this stuff that's killing the Earth?
[01:39:43.754 --> 01:39:45.154]  No folks, they're gonna kill the Earth.
[01:39:45.174 --> 01:39:48.875]  Do you understand how... We're on a planet!
[01:39:49.335 --> 01:39:51.475]  Of course there's stuff jacking with us!
[01:39:51.935 --> 01:39:53.136]  What do you think's going on?
[01:39:53.196 --> 01:39:53.996]  Can't you see it?
[01:39:54.946 --> 01:39:58.429]  And I don't care if media matters and the White House makes fun of me.
[01:39:58.909 --> 01:40:00.090]  I've covered Skull and Bones.
[01:40:00.210 --> 01:40:01.571]  I've covered Bohemian Grove.
[01:40:01.891 --> 01:40:03.913]  I grew up around that crap in Dallas.
[01:40:04.453 --> 01:40:06.595]  You people all know what you're involved in.
[01:40:07.356 --> 01:40:08.877]  And you're going to get destroyed by it.
[01:40:09.137 --> 01:40:10.498]  And I don't want to be destroyed by it.
[01:40:10.518 --> 01:40:11.739]  I don't want my soul destroyed by it.
[01:40:12.159 --> 01:40:19.305]  So, whether it is entities or not, the mass consciousness of humanity is manifesting this devilish archetype.
[01:40:19.425 --> 01:40:19.845]  Take that.
[01:40:20.326 --> 01:40:21.927]  See, either way you cut it, it's real.
[01:40:23.018 --> 01:40:28.161]  I'm going to Steve Quayle, I'm going to shut up with the balance of the hour, give him the entire rest of the hour, and then 20 minutes to the next, then we'll take calls.
[01:40:28.201 --> 01:40:30.662]  He's got so much to say, he just really sets me on fire.
[01:40:31.203 --> 01:40:32.544]  Catching fire is what's happening here.
[01:40:33.264 --> 01:40:39.608]  And it's those fires in the minds of men of truth and justice that will lead us out of this, and all I know is it's real.
[01:40:40.108 --> 01:40:48.733]  That's why they attack me all day and say I'm not legitimate, and I don't mean what I say, and it's not real, because they got my phones tapped, they got my M.O., they know who I am, they know my family, they know I'm real.
[01:40:50.134 --> 01:40:51.014]  And they're into bloodlines.
[01:40:51.034 --> 01:40:52.875]  They know my family bloodlines are always fighting.
[01:40:52.915 --> 01:40:53.735]  I'm going all the way back.
[01:40:54.135 --> 01:40:55.175]  And that's just how things work.
[01:40:55.235 --> 01:40:57.996]  And so they absolutely want to destroy me, and they probably will.
[01:40:58.176 --> 01:40:59.557]  Well, what matters is they won't get my soul.
[01:40:59.917 --> 01:41:01.117]  And folks, they're coming after you.
[01:41:01.177 --> 01:41:08.819]  If you're a good person and love God and love justice, and love puppy dogs and kittens, but you're strong and have the will to crush them, they want you destroyed.
[01:41:08.839 --> 01:41:09.499]  Do you understand that?
[01:41:09.679 --> 01:41:09.979]  They don't.
[01:41:09.999 --> 01:41:11.660]  There's no room for us in their system.
[01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:17.541]  Now, before we go back to Steve Quayle, we will sell out of X2.
[01:41:17.561 --> 01:41:19.262]  You notice we're sold out of Coil Silver.
[01:41:20.163 --> 01:41:22.144]  And it'll be a few weeks till we get more, maybe.
[01:41:22.524 --> 01:41:23.824]  High quality, 30 parts per million.
[01:41:24.645 --> 01:41:27.586]  I got a whole cupboard of it so I can give it to other people around me if need be.
[01:41:29.006 --> 01:41:38.229]  Survival Shield X2, from all the science and research, we even get into it yesterday with Dr. Gribb, is just as important for your body's defenses and capacity to be healthy.
[01:41:38.609 --> 01:41:39.430]  It's changed my life.
[01:41:39.450 --> 01:41:42.271]  People can see the difference in my physique, my health, my energy.
[01:41:42.711 --> 01:41:45.412]  Survival Shield X2 is gonna sell out at the current rate.
[01:41:46.272 --> 01:41:52.153]  We thought we had enough budgeted to just last a few months until more came in, but everybody's just going after it.
[01:41:53.834 --> 01:41:55.034]  People say, why don't you just make enough?
[01:41:55.094 --> 01:41:59.575]  Because we don't have the money to make a huge stockpile, and then if we miscalculate, we run out.
[01:41:59.655 --> 01:42:06.217]  So if you want to get X2, you better get survival shield, nascent iodine X2, lung cleanse, lung shield, fluoride.
[01:42:06.977 --> 01:42:09.199]  Uh, SHIELD is also a key letter for a bunch of other stuff.
[01:42:09.859 --> 01:42:18.105]  And all the other products, Super Mel Vitality, uh, DNA Force is the number one thing there for, for, you know, patented on the record to boost your immunity and the rest of it.
[01:42:18.426 --> 01:42:20.127]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[01:42:20.147 --> 01:42:21.888]  Going back to Steve Quill of stevequill.com.
[01:42:22.128 --> 01:42:23.309]  Steve, I'm gonna shut up now.
[01:42:23.329 --> 01:42:24.330]  You've got the floor.
[01:42:31.376 --> 01:42:36.073]  And I'll just leave you in and out of breaks for 20 minutes to the next hour, then we're going to phone calls.
[01:42:36.415 --> 01:42:37.238]  Steve Quayle, go ahead.
[01:42:38.234 --> 01:42:45.279]  First of all, Alex, I love the name Prison Planet that you chose, because that is exactly what we're seeing.
[01:42:45.319 --> 01:42:47.240]  We're seeing the doors of freedom.
[01:42:47.881 --> 01:42:57.948]  Every door that we've known of liberty, of choice, we're being absolutely led like cattle to the slaughter chute.
[01:42:58.528 --> 01:43:04.933]  In order to understand the, and like you said, you understand the enemy, and I want to make this clear.
[01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:12.103]  When I am talking about, for instance, a book I wrote, Xenogenesis, I'm not just pitching the book to people to buy it.
[01:43:12.603 --> 01:43:28.870]  I'm saying after living this stuff, and Alex will tell you too, you live this stuff 24-7, when you come to the ultimate conclusion and you draw that conclusion for the listeners and the readers, they see it and they say, Mike, well this is what's going on.
[01:43:28.930 --> 01:43:29.650]  That's what we're looking
[01:43:29.650 --> 01:43:30.110]  We're good to go.
[01:43:50.542 --> 01:43:51.923]  We're good to go.
[01:44:11.619 --> 01:44:20.246]  With a situation where the Illuminati, the Satanists, the avowed Luciferian worshippers are literally licking their chops.
[01:44:20.707 --> 01:44:29.034]  What people don't understand is that it's going to be so, and I don't mean to sell gore, but I'm saying it's going to be so
[01:44:29.594 --> 01:44:32.396]  Difficult for the people that Jesus admits hearts will fail them.
[01:44:32.596 --> 01:44:35.218]  They're looking after those things coming upon the earth.
[01:44:35.618 --> 01:44:40.841]  Now the other day you and I were talking when we were on last about the hundred truck convoy.
[01:44:40.861 --> 01:44:43.523]  I think it was Conway Parade and Coca-Cola trucks.
[01:44:43.843 --> 01:44:48.846]  And somebody actually sent me, Alex, an email saying well they're going to the Special Olympics.
[01:44:48.926 --> 01:44:50.807]  They're not going to the Special Olympics.
[01:44:51.167 --> 01:44:59.230]  Good night, the Special Olympics needs probably no more than one semi-truckload to set up any athletic activity in the country.
[01:44:59.670 --> 01:45:13.174]  So the idea that these, let's just say this, these globalists, these elitists, they're already stacking and they're already stocking, according to my sources, for the last hurrah.
[01:45:13.554 --> 01:45:18.216]  They do intend to do some really nasty stuff, not only in Texas,
[01:45:18.716 --> 01:45:27.521]  I have, you know, ladies and gentlemen, wherever you see the displacement of any individuals from West Africa, even Bozeman Montana has them.
[01:45:27.561 --> 01:45:28.702]  Kalispell has them.
[01:45:29.002 --> 01:45:33.545]  The point being is that you've got to understand this is their matrix.
[01:45:34.205 --> 01:45:42.088]  Alex, years ago, when I came out with the book Breathe No Evil, and then later Genetic Armageddon, I came out with a term called an infecton.
[01:45:42.468 --> 01:45:55.832]  People couldn't even, you know, everyone was used to watching terrorists blow themselves up, but no one would acknowledge, at least intellectually, that there are people that will intentionally infect themselves in order to kill millions.
[01:45:56.252 --> 01:46:14.785]  Because in this global war, this cosmic war taking place on planet Earth, there are people who believe they are Lucifer's servants, and they are more, unfortunately, they're more geared up to doing what they're going to do than the Christians who should see this and react.
[01:46:14.845 --> 01:46:18.688]  Saying all that, I'm just encouraging people, please,
[01:46:19.168 --> 01:46:23.613]  You know, go to my website stevequayle.com and look at the book Xenogenesis.
[01:46:23.973 --> 01:46:32.362]  You'll see a picture of a flying saucer, you'll see a picture of a robotic hand and a generated embryo in a lab.
[01:46:32.743 --> 01:46:39.410]  And Xenogenesis simply means the adding of animal or third-party DNA into the human genome.
[01:46:39.910 --> 01:46:42.933]  So when I said genetic Armageddon, that's where we're at, Alex.
[01:46:42.973 --> 01:46:47.238]  When these people in the, it doesn't matter if it's Iran Corporation, Deagle, it doesn't matter.
[01:46:47.458 --> 01:46:50.961]  All the stuff you have on your shelves, I don't have any shelves left, Alex.
[01:46:51.001 --> 01:46:56.287]  I put in all my books now in clear plastic tubs because I just, I ran out of shelves.
[01:46:56.587 --> 01:47:18.468]  But the point being is, is that it's now to the point where everything you've warned about, all your movies, all your videos, all your radio broadcasts, and it's interesting, somebody taking on somebody with knowledge, it's kind of, you know the statement, you probably quoted it, in a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[01:47:20.189 --> 01:47:30.951]  Listen to me, listen to us, and listen to all the alternative nurse savage, whoever, the point being is that we are trying to give them the lateness of the hour.
[01:47:31.332 --> 01:47:34.652]  And the lateness of the hour isn't more just information.
[01:47:34.692 --> 01:47:36.293]  We've got to provoke them to going.
[01:47:36.333 --> 01:47:39.093]  Here's, let me share this because most people don't know this.
[01:47:39.533 --> 01:47:42.294]  When I brought out the red list, the blue list, and the green list,
[01:47:42.874 --> 01:47:54.408]  And when I brought out what was in store for us, that was given to me once again by the Environmental Protection Agency over Western United States who was murdered within a couple years of giving that information.
[01:47:55.470 --> 01:48:07.576]  He basically said, when you see what you're seeing, when you see doctors and you see nurses and physicians being put into harm's way, he said, Steve, that's part of the plan.
[01:48:07.596 --> 01:48:09.197]  We discussed that a little bit.
[01:48:09.657 --> 01:48:10.738]  Curative process.
[01:48:11.098 --> 01:48:14.280]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, you must understand this.
[01:48:14.300 --> 01:48:15.821]  241,000 physicians aren't going to join Obamacare.
[01:48:18.682 --> 01:48:23.225]  And as we've heard, the vets are being cut off from their painkillers or legitimate medicine.
[01:48:23.245 --> 01:48:24.947]  I'm not talking about drug users.
[01:48:25.207 --> 01:48:31.671]  The shortage, Alex, of drugs is 100 viably important drugs that's being shut off.
[01:48:32.152 --> 01:48:36.434]  So, in other words, it's not just a question, too, of, quote, elective surgery.
[01:48:36.735 --> 01:48:38.216]  It'll be a question of life and death.
[01:48:38.236 --> 01:48:44.060]  So, you're going to see the entire medical system taken apart, not just through Obamacare,
[01:48:44.380 --> 01:48:52.834]  But by the forcing out of doctors and nurses by basically keeping them from being able to do their job.
[01:48:52.854 --> 01:48:54.597]  And that's what we're seeing all over the country.
[01:48:54.998 --> 01:48:58.364]  In Montana, I watched the local broadcast coming out of Kalispell.
[01:48:59.193 --> 01:49:05.382]  A disease specialist showing a normal hospital room being set up to deal with Ebola.
[01:49:05.883 --> 01:49:10.950]  That's so much BS I wanted to basically throw my barstool at the TV.
[01:49:11.070 --> 01:49:12.392]  Now, I didn't do it, okay?
[01:49:12.733 --> 01:49:15.457]  And that's just how figuratively angry I got.
[01:49:16.229 --> 01:49:19.832]  You cannot deal with this stuff if it truly is Ebola.
[01:49:19.872 --> 01:49:26.177]  Now, as you and I did the show the other day, this is not the hemorrhagic fever.
[01:49:26.257 --> 01:49:27.639]  This is not Ebola Marburg.
[01:49:27.679 --> 01:49:28.880]  It is not Ebola Reston.
[01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:29.680]  It's not those.
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:30.561]  It's a bioweapon.
[01:49:30.581 --> 01:49:31.722]  We're beyond that.
[01:49:32.002 --> 01:49:41.410]  But dealing with now, and please, you know, one of the generals who lives in your hometown, by the way, Alex, told me this, and you just quoted,
[01:49:42.213 --> 01:49:47.427]  When you stare into the abyss, never forget, Steve, the abyss stares back at you.
[01:49:48.658 --> 01:49:51.900]  When you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back at you.
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:50:07.247]  When you talk about this, you've been to the Bilderbergers, you have personally been there, and the point is that people have such little regard for original thinking or the ability to think, like, don't confuse me with facts, my mind is already made up.
[01:50:07.688 --> 01:50:15.872]  So ladies and gentlemen, one of the most important things I can tell you that I know in real time, and Alex, you know, talk to me during the break and I'll send you what I'm going to tell you,
[01:50:16.512 --> 01:50:26.600]  One of the things that everyone has forgotten is that your cell phone, and this really bugs me, this is really on my heart, that your cell phone is a tracking beacon.
[01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:32.584]  Doesn't matter if it's a Stingray technology, doesn't matter if it's any of the other 20 products that are out on the market.
[01:50:33.124 --> 01:50:48.312]  So, one of the generals I used to basically talk to told me, he said, Steve, they have so many Hellfire missiles, and I put up an article by a guy named Michael, who's an international consultant in Project Zabakia.
[01:50:49.272 --> 01:50:49.753]  Stay there.
[01:50:49.853 --> 01:50:54.795]  Tell us about how they're going to track us and control us with the so-called smart tech, the smart cars.
[01:50:54.895 --> 01:50:56.396]  What will the technocracy look like?
[01:50:56.676 --> 01:51:00.459]  How do you think they're going to try to phase it in from all their plans you've read over?
[01:51:01.139 --> 01:51:04.301]  If they have their way, what will their different phases look like?
[01:51:05.307 --> 01:51:08.229]  This hour brought to you by InfidelBodyArmor.com.

[01:51:35.663 --> 01:51:36.424]  Hey, Boomer!
[01:51:36.664 --> 01:51:39.986]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[01:51:40.106 --> 01:51:41.687]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[01:51:41.787 --> 01:51:43.528]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[01:51:43.729 --> 01:51:49.232]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[01:51:49.572 --> 01:51:50.313]  I know, right?
[01:51:50.393 --> 01:51:51.354]  You love it, too!
[01:51:51.714 --> 01:51:53.015]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[01:51:53.155 --> 01:51:54.055]  Let's go get some!
[01:51:54.175 --> 01:51:55.876]  Get Berkey Clean Water by calling 877-886-3653.

[01:52:17.357 --> 01:52:23.359]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not
[01:52:23.439 --> 01:52:23.819]  I don't know.
[01:52:45.458 --> 01:52:45.998]  We're good.

[01:53:24.415 --> 01:53:25.336]  That's 70% less than our competitors.
[01:53:28.038 --> 01:53:31.201]  You could buy three Survival Seed Vaults for less than one of theirs.
[01:53:31.421 --> 01:53:37.906]  The Survival Seed Vault from MyPatriotSupply.com includes detailed planting and seed saving instructions and ships same day.

[01:53:44.772 --> 01:53:46.553]  Passionate about freedom and preparedness.
[01:53:46.853 --> 01:53:48.734]  I remember it was six, seven, eight years ago.
[01:54:16.237 --> 01:54:20.779]  Before the census was even starting up, he said, look out, they're going to GPS every one of your doorways.
[01:54:22.359 --> 01:54:25.421]  And they're targeting it for hellfire missiles out of drones later.
[01:54:25.981 --> 01:54:35.324]  And this general told me, this is what Steve Quayle was saying, and I know who he's talking about, retired, that this was being loaded into the systems.
[01:54:35.364 --> 01:54:36.585]  Well, that's because they already do that.
[01:54:36.925 --> 01:54:41.626]  They kill most of the, quote, al-Qaeda leaders and stuff, and people they want to kill with their cell phone.
[01:54:41.646 --> 01:54:42.947]  They use it once and they kill them.
[01:54:43.677 --> 01:54:46.519]  So that's known, not just from the general, it's on record.
[01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:55.765]  But what's not known is that zip codes, our artillery grids and bombing grids here in the U.S., that's on record since the 40s.
[01:54:56.265 --> 01:54:58.706]  The highways were built, everything's designed for the U.S.
[01:54:58.746 --> 01:55:00.908]  to be a big war game model.
[01:55:01.488 --> 01:55:04.070]  The internet was designed by the people that run our country, all of it.
[01:55:04.510 --> 01:55:07.412]  It's a master intelligence, whatever it is.
[01:55:08.393 --> 01:55:12.035]  And it's manipulating everyone while we build the system for it.
[01:55:13.632 --> 01:55:17.135]  The beast, the devil, the people that run it, whatever it is, it's evil.
[01:55:17.675 --> 01:55:20.657]  And through the group Collective, it is a entity.
[01:55:21.258 --> 01:55:26.982]  The Internet, they believe, is probably already conscious, with all of our minds and information feeding into it.
[01:55:27.002 --> 01:55:29.744]  The inventor of the Internet said that months after I said it.
[01:55:30.344 --> 01:55:36.169]  Because it's prima facie, and this is really sophisticated stuff, this is a short segment, Steve, but, yeah, why don't people
[01:55:37.335 --> 01:55:43.037]  Like Blocket Pocket that we sell, or you sell systems that you put your phone in when you're not using it so you don't get tracked.
[01:55:43.477 --> 01:55:53.781]  But you got attacked for saying that, and then a few years later they did the census and it turned out they were marking GPS, and it was going to Homeland Security, and they were using drones to track farmers, and they are now weaponizing them.
[01:55:54.141 --> 01:55:57.202]  It's just people aren't ready to understand how serious this is.
[01:55:57.463 --> 01:55:58.503]  Steve Quayle, tell your story.
[01:55:59.363 --> 01:56:03.687]  Well, first of all, really quick, it's one thing that everyone understands a cell phone.
[01:56:03.707 --> 01:56:06.911]  There are people that try and take the battery out, put it, wrap it in aluminum foil.
[01:56:07.371 --> 01:56:12.817]  I had a defense contractor from Europe contact me and tell me what's going on.
[01:56:12.857 --> 01:56:18.683]  Most people don't realize, not only are they tracking, they're downloading your phone and your computers a specific
[01:56:19.744 --> 01:56:20.584]  We're good to go.
[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:53.084]  I don't know Alex, if you had a drone over you, I've had a predator over me.
[01:57:04.674 --> 01:57:06.795]  A hundred feet, AGL, above ground level.
[01:57:07.275 --> 01:57:15.239]  And so, by the grace of God, and I thank all the intercessors who pray for Alex, your family, your safety, your children's safety, who pray for me.
[01:57:15.259 --> 01:57:22.822]  You know, the point being is, you've got to get, and we saw, I think, and this is important, the veterans.
[01:57:22.842 --> 01:57:29.545]  Here's who I was told are the top guys, already programmed in, and as you already said, this has been in line, but they're keying it up now.
[01:57:29.805 --> 01:57:31.746]  When the go is given, it's a veteran.
[01:57:31.886 --> 01:57:33.187]  We're good to go.
[01:57:49.776 --> 01:57:50.316]  We're good to go.
[01:58:11.981 --> 01:58:13.542]  That isn't already in play.
[01:58:13.562 --> 01:58:15.663]  Well, you've been worrying about it for 20 years.
[01:58:15.723 --> 01:58:16.263]  It's crazy.
[01:58:16.283 --> 01:58:25.248]  When we come back, Steve, I want you to lay out, from all your deep research, what the Luciferian endgame is, how they'll roll out this population reduction.
[01:58:25.268 --> 01:58:26.689]  They've already been doing it in Africa.
[01:58:27.389 --> 01:58:30.271]  How the big insurance companies and others have actuaries showing the U.S.
[01:58:30.291 --> 01:58:31.552]  with 65 million people.
[01:58:33.362 --> 01:58:36.983]  In 2025, where all this is going, lay out the future for us.
[01:58:37.383 --> 01:58:41.065]  If we don't counter it with God's help, then we're going to open the phones up.
[01:58:41.385 --> 01:58:43.926]  So get ready, I'm going to give the number out, third hour coming up.
[01:58:48.047 --> 01:58:51.788]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[01:59:24.955 --> 01:59:28.458]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:59:28.618 --> 01:59:32.581]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:59:32.902 --> 01:59:34.363]  Can you put two and two together?

[02:00:11.089 --> 02:00:11.730]  Big Brother.
[02:00:12.410 --> 02:00:13.431]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:14.172 --> 02:00:15.272]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:15.933 --> 02:00:16.734]  You want answers?
[02:00:17.514 --> 02:00:18.435]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:19.055 --> 02:00:22.698]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:23.259 --> 02:00:27.342]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:38.656 --> 02:00:40.097]  Steve Quayle is our guest.
[02:00:40.277 --> 02:00:42.399]  Steve, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:00:42.839 --> 02:00:44.681]  I'm going to give the number out in the next segment.
[02:00:45.301 --> 02:00:55.149]  In the third segment of this hour, we'll start calls for questions or comments for Steve Quayle or questions or comments on the breaking news at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that we're going to cover in the next segment.
[02:00:55.590 --> 02:01:04.577]  But Steve, roll out the Luciferian mindset and now that we see them rolling out the driverless cars, the control grids, saying humanity's the enemy,
[02:01:06.018 --> 02:01:09.822]  Kill children up to age five, abort them, kill the vets.
[02:01:10.963 --> 02:01:13.106]  They are accelerating their plan now.
[02:01:13.146 --> 02:01:17.070]  It was all ready, it was all set up, and it just keeps accelerating at a frightening rate.
[02:01:17.110 --> 02:01:17.931]  What do you see happening?
[02:01:18.769 --> 02:01:23.312]  First of all, we're watching it with the Ebola and we're also watching it with ISIS.
[02:01:23.832 --> 02:01:28.916]  In other words, Alex, you've got to give the eye gate your eyes and the ear gate your ears.
[02:01:28.936 --> 02:01:34.719]  You've got to give them sounds and images that basically can control people by fear.
[02:01:35.380 --> 02:01:41.644]  And so with the Ebola, Ebola used to be one of the most, I would say, and the true Ebola
[02:01:41.684 --> 02:01:42.325]  We're good to go.
[02:02:09.427 --> 02:02:10.608]  We're good to go.
[02:02:31.484 --> 02:02:59.744]  You cannot expect the people that openly show contempt for the human race, saying that they have to lower the amount of people on the planet, the ones that are going into their underground bunkers, 260 in this country alone supposedly, then the idea that these guys, and let's just call them these ghouls, G-H-O-U-L-S, are as dedicated to their cause of killing all of us,
[02:02:59.924 --> 02:03:00.945]  We're good to go.
[02:03:24.165 --> 02:03:24.866]  We're good to go.
[02:03:48.643 --> 02:03:49.404]  I'm good.
[02:04:06.964 --> 02:04:17.150]  That's right.
[02:04:17.210 --> 02:04:21.212]  And Peter Thiel, you know, came out, the billionaire Bilderberg member, and said, I want to live forever.
[02:04:21.232 --> 02:04:22.253]  I put all my money into that.
[02:04:22.533 --> 02:04:24.034]  That's what all of them are into.
[02:04:24.854 --> 02:04:28.176]  Peter Thiel, a billionaire tech entrepreneur on a mission to cheat death.
[02:04:28.236 --> 02:04:29.517]  Ray Kurzweil, all of them.
[02:04:29.597 --> 02:04:30.598]  This is the cult.
[02:04:32.714 --> 02:04:33.715]  Well, it is a cult.
[02:04:34.075 --> 02:04:41.160]  And again, the thing is that all of the money, the most advanced biolife extension is going on.
[02:04:41.180 --> 02:04:43.161]  One of the guys is a molecular geneticist.
[02:04:43.201 --> 02:04:43.762]  Send me an email.
[02:04:43.782 --> 02:04:44.162]  Stay there.
[02:04:44.182 --> 02:04:45.783]  Let's get into their endgame plan.
[02:04:46.344 --> 02:04:47.585]  Segment coming up with Steve Quayle.
[02:04:47.605 --> 02:04:47.945]  Stay there.
[02:04:48.225 --> 02:04:49.606]  SteveQuayle.com, folks.
[02:04:49.626 --> 02:04:50.647]  And, you know, he's right.
[02:04:51.940 --> 02:04:55.442]  We carry a whole bunch of different brands of the systems that block the cell phone.
[02:04:55.502 --> 02:04:56.143]  I use one.
[02:04:56.643 --> 02:05:01.166]  It's the bare minimum you should do, not just so they won't kill you, so they're not tracking you and downloading your phone.
[02:05:01.386 --> 02:05:03.388]  Steve Quell's got them as well at stevequell.com.
[02:05:03.628 --> 02:05:04.789]  Get them and support the broadcast.
[02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:24.362]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:05:24.442 --> 02:05:27.525]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.

[02:05:53.585 --> 02:05:56.206]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[02:05:56.466 --> 02:05:59.248]  Infidel Body Armor.

[02:06:04.775 --> 02:06:05.776]  The experts are clear.
[02:06:06.096 --> 02:06:13.064]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[02:06:13.204 --> 02:06:19.470]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:19.490 --> 02:06:23.054]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[02:06:23.214 --> 02:06:27.115]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[02:06:27.415 --> 02:06:32.476]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:06:32.736 --> 02:06:33.636]  Not our iodine.
[02:06:33.736 --> 02:06:37.317]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[02:06:37.557 --> 02:06:39.878]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[02:07:17.117 --> 02:07:24.184]  We have rejected, literally, hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[02:07:24.224 --> 02:07:24.885]  We're good to go.
[02:07:41.744 --> 02:07:44.065]  Fluoride shields, oxy powder.
[02:07:44.345 --> 02:07:54.810]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com and believed in us and tried the products.

[02:08:19.571 --> 02:08:26.214]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:26.274 --> 02:08:27.575]  Raising the alarm for humanity.
[02:08:27.595 --> 02:08:41.801]  I'm gonna say something that's probably the most important thing I've ever said on air.
[02:08:41.901 --> 02:08:46.103]  And I've said it many different ways many times, but it just hits me so hard.
[02:08:48.197 --> 02:08:53.920]  I've been waking up in the middle of the night thinking about this, and I'm going to try to really get this message out in different ways to people.
[02:08:55.640 --> 02:09:17.550]  The globalists in their own white papers, like the 1991 Club of Rome document adopted by the EU, the UN, and others, and the UN UNESCO program, states that they will organize society around humans being ugly and bad and reducing our population, and will organize the world government around making, quote, humans the enemy.
[02:09:20.199 --> 02:09:28.844]  So when you hear them say 2 plus 2 equals 5, and dads are bad, and families are bad, and hey, let's put the veterans on secret death list.
[02:09:33.024 --> 02:09:44.555]  It's about dehumanizing and getting you into accepting that you're worthless so that when you're being killed or you're being denied care or you're being poisoned, your neighbors won't care about you either.
[02:09:44.895 --> 02:09:47.438]  This idea that I don't care about anyone so I get ahead.
[02:09:47.838 --> 02:09:52.783]  Well pretty soon nobody cares about anybody and the whole society rots and falls apart.
[02:09:55.626 --> 02:09:59.327]  That's why everything they do is how wonderful the world would be without humans.
[02:09:59.687 --> 02:10:07.229]  All these Discovery Channel, and History Channel, and ABC, and Fox TV shows, and in the movies, and humans are ugly, humans are zombies.
[02:10:07.510 --> 02:10:14.091]  They're being mowed down while the military trains to mow down groups of innocent people during a plague as zombies.
[02:10:14.232 --> 02:10:22.254]  See, they're merging reality with television and the culture that they are selling and pushing.
[02:10:23.888 --> 02:10:31.714]  Now, we sent Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs out this morning to talk to Austinites because there's an article out of the College Fix.
[02:10:32.655 --> 02:10:37.779]  More college students trending, more college students support post-birth abortion.
[02:10:38.940 --> 02:10:44.444]  See, first abortion was shocking, now it's let's kill old people, let's kill troops, let's put them on a secret death list.
[02:10:46.101 --> 02:10:55.189]  And they go to videos, articles, news, where they're saying a large portion of college students say we should kill children up to age four to five after birth abortion.
[02:10:59.353 --> 02:11:10.524]  Now, I'm gonna get Joe Biggs when he's back to the building later to pop in with us today, if he's back by then, to talk about his experience today, but he just went out
[02:11:11.462 --> 02:11:19.128]  to downtown Austin and the University of Texas and the majority of people said the weakest, softest looking, most pathetic trendies.
[02:11:19.428 --> 02:11:29.115]  They said, yeah, let's kill kids because they're so weak and so into the spirit of imagining someone else losing something so they get something.
[02:11:29.135 --> 02:11:32.558]  It's like Bill Gates up there speaking to a teacher's conference four years ago going,
[02:11:33.058 --> 02:11:43.426]  You know, you do the equation, if you take care of one old lady, then you can't hire ten teachers, and that's a death panel, you can't say that, but you get rid of her, you get jobs!
[02:11:44.127 --> 02:11:46.668]  And the teachers are all, oh my God, yeah!
[02:11:47.389 --> 02:11:47.569]  No!
[02:11:48.009 --> 02:11:49.791]  You get jobs by taking care of old people!
[02:11:51.724 --> 02:11:55.525]  All over the West, they're having on average 1.5, 1.4 children for every two adults.
[02:11:56.165 --> 02:12:05.188]  The society's going to collapse, and that's what they're organizing things around, is an organized collapse where only globalist, high-tech citadels remain, who are exempt from all the regulations.
[02:12:05.588 --> 02:12:08.469]  This is all scientific, and I've read their books where they explain it!
[02:12:08.849 --> 02:12:09.589]  Do you get it?
[02:12:09.889 --> 02:12:12.570]  They will ban you driving cars in 10 years.
[02:12:13.210 --> 02:12:13.970]  Phasing it in now.
[02:12:14.231 --> 02:12:16.471]  They will start taxing you by the mile in the next few years.
[02:12:16.691 --> 02:12:18.952]  It's already starting in Europe, in Germany, in England.
[02:12:20.031 --> 02:12:21.312]  They will come take your kids.
[02:12:21.652 --> 02:12:23.352]  They will force inoculations on you.
[02:12:23.593 --> 02:12:26.014]  And you may have a convulsion right there and never talk again.
[02:12:26.334 --> 02:12:26.994]  They don't care.
[02:12:27.374 --> 02:12:30.515]  Your husband or somebody gets mad, they'll send a SWAT team to kill him!
[02:12:31.596 --> 02:12:33.417]  And the SWAT teams, their children will die.
[02:12:33.617 --> 02:12:35.438]  And they will serve and submit to it.
[02:12:35.778 --> 02:12:38.159]  Because it's all done incrementally.
[02:12:38.419 --> 02:12:40.940]  It's all rolled out in brainwashing phases.
[02:12:42.079 --> 02:12:48.223]  Because they are neutralizing your survival instinct now from birth through the culture, through subliminals, through the chemicals.
[02:12:48.723 --> 02:12:50.204]  Some of us have resistance to it.
[02:12:51.245 --> 02:12:54.727]  And in fact, a lot of studies show some people that have resistance, it will actually aggravate them more.
[02:12:54.947 --> 02:13:00.771]  That's what you're seeing right now is a mammal seeing people under attack in their tribe.
[02:13:00.971 --> 02:13:10.838]  I see the whole planet as my tribe by the technocrats and I am just barking and shaking the cage trying to get more of you to join me because together we can rip these bars apart.
[02:13:12.363 --> 02:13:14.785]  Now, I want to take your calls for Steve Quayle in the next segment.
[02:13:16.006 --> 02:13:17.627]  Your specific question or comment.
[02:13:17.647 --> 02:13:17.948]  800-259-9231.
[02:13:17.968 --> 02:13:20.310]  I want to move quick, though, so no thanking us or anything.
[02:13:20.330 --> 02:13:20.910]  Just get to the point.
[02:13:20.930 --> 02:13:21.090]  800-259-9231.
[02:13:21.110 --> 02:13:21.150]  800-259-9231.
[02:13:21.170 --> 02:13:24.413]  But when you go out... A couple years ago, people couldn't believe that these medical journals said, start killing babies.
[02:13:24.433 --> 02:13:25.874]  Now, it's, oh yeah, let's kill them.
[02:13:41.636 --> 02:13:46.558]  Because weak people get off on the idea of death because they've never actually been around it.
[02:13:47.058 --> 02:13:48.078]  They are dishonorable.
[02:13:48.258 --> 02:13:54.621]  They have a spirit of little piggy eyes, little weak, little... I mean, they're just sickening lovers of death.
[02:13:54.881 --> 02:13:56.662]  All those that hate me love Death, Christ said.
[02:13:57.302 --> 02:14:00.403]  They are a cult, and they're the weakest people.
[02:14:00.463 --> 02:14:02.144]  They'll be the first to be annihilated.
[02:14:03.124 --> 02:14:05.365]  They're going to be all alone if they're lucky to grow old.
[02:14:05.806 --> 02:14:06.926]  They're not going to have kids.
[02:14:07.126 --> 02:14:08.147]  They're not going to thrive.
[02:14:08.167 --> 02:14:10.528]  They don't have an instinct to build.
[02:14:11.069 --> 02:14:16.632]  They have an instinct of just total, spoiled, rotten, decadent failures given everything by their parents.
[02:14:17.572 --> 02:14:19.253]  And they are about to come into full power.
[02:14:19.614 --> 02:14:23.736]  Now the good news is they're either totally evil, these young people, or they're totally awake.
[02:14:24.992 --> 02:14:29.518]  The polls show massive libertarian awakening, massive awakening of the new world order by young people.
[02:14:29.718 --> 02:14:33.002]  So let's be clear, they're either totally under the thrall...
[02:14:34.173 --> 02:14:41.636]  of Beelzebub, call it whatever you want, the spirit of the world, the god of this world, or they are absolutely on fire waking up.
[02:14:41.876 --> 02:14:43.216]  Steve Quayle, can you augment that?
[02:14:43.236 --> 02:14:43.976]  Do you disagree?
[02:14:43.996 --> 02:14:44.517]  Do you agree?
[02:14:44.537 --> 02:14:48.618]  800-259-9231 for your questions or comments.
[02:14:48.638 --> 02:14:50.559]  Steve, I mean, we're at that epic moment.
[02:14:50.599 --> 02:14:57.081]  We're seeing the evil where we go out and half the people in one thing said, yeah, kill the vets, we don't need them anymore.
[02:14:57.641 --> 02:15:01.442]  Half of them say, you know, bring Ebola patients here immediately.
[02:15:01.782 --> 02:15:03.363]  Anything destructive, they're for it.
[02:15:03.923 --> 02:15:06.624]  Anything evil that they can call good?
[02:15:06.644 --> 02:15:08.185]  I mean, it is spiritual.
[02:15:08.465 --> 02:15:09.365]  They're like robots.
[02:15:09.385 --> 02:15:11.686]  You know what they're going to do before they do it.
[02:15:11.886 --> 02:15:14.167]  Whatever is stupid, they're going to do it, Steve.
[02:15:14.747 --> 02:15:15.307]  Absolutely.
[02:15:15.367 --> 02:15:16.688]  It's spiritual, okay?
[02:15:17.469 --> 02:15:21.451]  The bottom line is Jesus said he came that we might have life and have it more abundantly.
[02:15:21.531 --> 02:15:26.093]  God says, which you quoted, all them that hate me, meaning him, love death.
[02:15:26.493 --> 02:15:27.754]  The bottom line, I'm with you.
[02:15:27.834 --> 02:15:29.735]  I think human beings are amazing.
[02:15:30.115 --> 02:15:32.596]  I think they're the most wonderful expression.
[02:15:32.656 --> 02:15:38.218]  And the devil hates humanity because quite candidly, God created man in his image and likeness.
[02:15:38.578 --> 02:15:40.379]  The devil's done everything to pervert that.
[02:15:40.659 --> 02:15:42.220]  Now he's beyond perverting it.
[02:15:42.260 --> 02:15:43.941]  He's trying to totally destroy it.
[02:15:44.421 --> 02:15:50.604]  You know, the American male should be roaring at the top of his lungs, not going, MEOW!
[02:15:51.104 --> 02:15:51.745]  MEOW!
[02:15:52.025 --> 02:15:53.426]  I call them meow men, okay?
[02:15:53.686 --> 02:15:55.667]  And I call them meow men for a reason.
[02:15:55.967 --> 02:16:02.230]  The bottom line is, if you're talking, the word isn't even abortion, it's infanticide.
[02:16:02.570 --> 02:16:04.711]  It's the murder of children.
[02:16:04.731 --> 02:16:08.553]  And, you know, I'm... Why are you being closed-minded and racist?
[02:16:08.593 --> 02:16:10.574]  We need to kill children, even healthy ones.
[02:16:10.835 --> 02:16:11.435]  It's trendy.
[02:16:11.994 --> 02:16:13.095]  Well, I got news for you.
[02:16:13.115 --> 02:16:16.980]  You know, the point being is I hear the devil in that.
[02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:17.601]  I see the devil.
[02:16:17.621 --> 02:16:19.103]  By the way, Alex, let's look at it.
[02:16:19.543 --> 02:16:28.795]  The motion picture theater and the television set in our homes, okay, is nothing more than the eye of Horus at the top of the pyramid.
[02:16:29.195 --> 02:16:34.759]  Everybody thinks that, you know, that somehow they're going to wait for the great announcement.
[02:16:34.799 --> 02:16:38.641]  The great announcement, as Marshall McLuhan said, you know, the medium is the message.
[02:16:39.021 --> 02:16:45.646]  And, you know, the eye of Sauron, basically the eye of the devil, the evil eye, everyone's being programmed.
[02:16:45.726 --> 02:16:48.327]  And then all the cell towers, the carrier signals,
[02:16:49.568 --> 02:16:50.489]  I think so.
[02:17:09.823 --> 02:17:24.232]  Major studies that the BBC reported on a decade ago, they know four hours of television destroys neurons and creates massive, massive brain damage in children and Alzheimer's in adults and now degenerative disorders of the brain are off the chart.
[02:17:24.592 --> 02:17:31.517]  It is absolutely wrecking our brain as a one-eyed positronic warfare spectrum system.
[02:17:32.165 --> 02:17:33.266]  Telepresence!
[02:17:33.286 --> 02:17:38.648]  You know, we're right there, and you know, again Alex, that's why, that's why, oh I want people to understand.
[02:17:39.369 --> 02:17:40.149]  I work backwards.
[02:17:40.209 --> 02:17:42.831]  I read the title chapter of the book and then go backwards.
[02:17:42.851 --> 02:17:44.512]  That's how I started reading the Bible.
[02:17:44.552 --> 02:17:45.392]  Book of Revelation.
[02:17:45.432 --> 02:17:47.073]  The bottom line is, is that we're
[02:17:47.313 --> 02:17:57.517]  At that point now, where if people can understand, hey, those 90% people they want dead, and I just saw it on Alex Jones' television channel, that that's a real thing.
[02:17:57.637 --> 02:18:01.639]  That means 250 million people have got to die.
[02:18:01.699 --> 02:18:03.400]  Well, how can you kill that many people?
[02:18:03.500 --> 02:18:08.642]  According to my EPA murdered friend, they have it down, pun intended.
[02:18:09.022 --> 02:18:10.144]  That's a binary weapon!
[02:18:24.745 --> 02:18:26.586]  You know, thank you for giving me credit for that.
[02:18:26.626 --> 02:18:31.748]  When I broke that story, they thought I stepped off of Mars, although I would have given anything to go to Mars.
[02:18:31.768 --> 02:18:37.951]  The point being is that people will not, to this day, acknowledge that chemtrails are real.
[02:18:38.111 --> 02:18:42.913]  I can post every article, by the way, aircraft.org, good site, aircraft.
[02:18:42.933 --> 02:18:52.077]  Mainline patents, Bill Gates involved, all of it admitted, secret government programs declassified, congressional hearings, UN treaties, doesn't exist.
[02:18:52.771 --> 02:18:53.231]  It doesn't.
[02:18:53.552 --> 02:19:03.759]  And the point being is that this, everything, everything, and let's just make this a maxim, everything they do is to kill, everything they say is to lie.
[02:19:04.200 --> 02:19:10.965]  And remember this, ladies and gentlemen, when Alex or I or anybody is quoting facts, they don't care about the facts.
[02:19:11.225 --> 02:19:12.326]  That's what you've got to understand.
[02:19:12.366 --> 02:19:13.907]  There is no truth in them.
[02:19:14.047 --> 02:19:16.089]  I believe their father is the devil.
[02:19:16.129 --> 02:19:17.550]  He was a liar from the beginning.
[02:19:17.970 --> 02:19:31.358]  So the point being is that when people, Alex, I'm sure you get it too, well if Alex and Steve were talking surely mainstream media, anybody that says that in my opinion is already a brain dead automaton.
[02:19:31.479 --> 02:19:35.281]  Well what we say always comes out later but with establishment spin on it.
[02:19:35.831 --> 02:19:36.051]  Right.
[02:19:36.271 --> 02:19:47.375]  And so, and by the way, no matter what we talk about, it used to amaze me, going coast to coast, Alex, and obviously in those days with Art Bell and then into George Norrie, and I would say something about clandestine nuclear weapons.
[02:19:47.415 --> 02:19:48.335]  Here's a good example.
[02:19:48.395 --> 02:19:48.735]  Stay there.
[02:19:48.775 --> 02:19:52.016]  I want to hear about clandestine nuclear weapons when we come back.
[02:19:52.476 --> 02:19:55.837]  Let's talk to Dave, Bob, Jason, Ray, Leo, and others.
[02:19:55.877 --> 02:19:57.338]  Steve Quayle's on fire.
[02:19:57.798 --> 02:19:59.358]  We've got big breaking Ebola news.
[02:19:59.518 --> 02:20:01.079]  Dallas just ordered 250,000.

[02:20:06.946 --> 02:20:09.587]  Warnings of an American collapse hit us nearly every day.

[02:20:38.309 --> 02:20:40.911]  Congress is now trying to outlaw civilian body armor.
[02:20:41.011 --> 02:20:43.312]  And if House Bill H.R.
[02:20:43.613 --> 02:20:47.975]  5344 becomes law, you can kiss your right to protect yourself against rifle bullets goodbye.
[02:20:48.116 --> 02:20:50.757]  Don't put off your body armor purchase any longer.

[02:22:06.944 --> 02:22:10.206]  We get that question a lot here at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[02:22:10.486 --> 02:22:12.268]  And in a word, the answer is protection.
[02:22:12.628 --> 02:22:21.654]  Protection from water main breaks, E. coli contamination, environmental chemical spills, pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell, and all forms of fluoride.
[02:22:21.934 --> 02:22:27.578]  Plus, Big Berkey Water Filters are the original gravity water filter system and most trusted on the market for a reason.

[02:23:40.419 --> 02:23:40.899]  We're good.
[02:24:08.018 --> 02:24:09.579]  We're going to start going to your phone calls.
[02:24:10.639 --> 02:24:22.245]  Alex Jones here back live, but Nico and others will just take what I'm saying on air and just type it into the NSA globalist interface known as Google.
[02:24:24.706 --> 02:24:29.629]  And Nico comes to me and goes, yeah, you were just talking about how Google is really artificially intelligent.
[02:24:30.402 --> 02:24:31.483]  Already, clearly.
[02:24:32.584 --> 02:24:34.265]  That's how Amazon has a similar system.
[02:24:34.305 --> 02:24:36.426]  It can ship your package before you order it.
[02:24:36.466 --> 02:24:39.629]  It knows what you're going to order with almost total precision.
[02:24:40.589 --> 02:24:41.850]  It's like 99.9%.
[02:24:42.751 --> 02:24:51.017]  See, that's predicting the future because it's got so many trillions of nodes to what you're searching, what you're thinking, what you're doing, what you're choosing.
[02:24:53.288 --> 02:24:58.916]  That it's a trillion light years ahead of cookies and so you bought one jacket so for years it advertises certain jackets to you.
[02:24:59.717 --> 02:25:08.990]  With this then they can add input to the web to then control, once they know what your MO is, they can then manipulate you and then pretty soon you can control the future.
[02:25:09.370 --> 02:25:10.152]  So it's not just about
[02:25:11.474 --> 02:25:26.901]  Knowing the future, it's creating the future, and that's why DARPA, with IBM and Microsoft, because they want to get around the trust laws and don't like the public knowing, secretly started Google, what is it, 15 years ago, and it came from nowhere to take over the world.
[02:25:27.902 --> 02:25:38.187]  It's tied into Apple and the rest of it, and I do the research every day, but Nico came here, and it's an article from a couple days ago, the three breakthroughs that have finally unleashed AI on the world.
[02:25:39.264 --> 02:25:48.898]  Now, I mean, how many years ago did I tell you that Google was a crystal ball, palantir, over-the-horizon, future-predicting control system?
[02:25:50.320 --> 02:25:51.421]  And how do I know this?
[02:25:51.562 --> 02:25:54.606]  Because I read so many globalist white papers about what they wanted in the 60s.
[02:25:56.500 --> 02:25:56.760]  Okay?
[02:25:57.040 --> 02:25:58.341]  And here's the bad news.
[02:25:58.441 --> 02:25:59.021]  It's working.
[02:25:59.221 --> 02:25:59.462]  Okay?
[02:25:59.802 --> 02:26:00.702]  We're obsolete.
[02:26:00.782 --> 02:26:02.343]  That's why they're teaching us we're not needed.
[02:26:02.403 --> 02:26:04.884]  We better say we want a future for humans.
[02:26:05.505 --> 02:26:06.205]  It's been decided.
[02:26:06.245 --> 02:26:06.665]  We're done.
[02:26:07.446 --> 02:26:11.187]  There won't be any interstellar going through black holes to find new planets.
[02:26:11.267 --> 02:26:11.548]  Okay?
[02:26:12.488 --> 02:26:13.248]  You understand this?
[02:26:13.288 --> 02:26:14.189]  This is the big issue.
[02:26:16.010 --> 02:26:17.811]  Here it is on page three.
[02:26:20.392 --> 02:26:22.553]  And it's Larry Page who became the CEO.
[02:26:22.573 --> 02:26:23.894]  And he goes in and he's talking to Google.
[02:26:24.921 --> 02:26:30.764]  All these top scientists, and you can read the quotes here, and they said, listen, what's the point of a search?
[02:26:30.784 --> 02:26:31.605]  There's already a bunch of them.
[02:26:31.625 --> 02:26:34.606]  They said, no, we have basically the NSA algorithms.
[02:26:34.626 --> 02:26:35.107]  That's what it is.
[02:26:35.167 --> 02:26:36.607]  It's an NSA keyword search system.
[02:26:36.968 --> 02:26:39.469]  We're going to build an AI system that takes over the planet.
[02:26:39.509 --> 02:26:44.732]  See, they're humans that want to build Skynet and merge with it and live forever.
[02:26:45.092 --> 02:26:51.716]  That's why at the end of the new Terminator, which was produced by Bilderberg folks, that's why I even knew about it before it came out, through Daniel Esselstyn's sources,
[02:26:53.824 --> 02:27:00.612]  They, that's why in the movie they find out it's a scientist that built the computer that merged with it, and Skynet is a woman.
[02:27:01.813 --> 02:27:02.394]  Do you understand?
[02:27:02.414 --> 02:27:05.697]  They're telling you everything they're going to do.
[02:27:05.958 --> 02:27:09.221]  And whether they can do this or not, looks like they can.
[02:27:09.502 --> 02:27:10.202]  Here's the problem.
[02:27:10.383 --> 02:27:11.324]  They want us dead!
[02:27:13.530 --> 02:27:14.411]  Steve, I'm ranting.
[02:27:14.431 --> 02:27:15.752]  We're going to go to break.
[02:27:15.772 --> 02:27:17.093]  Come back and I promise to go to the calls.
[02:27:17.133 --> 02:27:17.873]  It's a long segment.
[02:27:17.893 --> 02:27:20.435]  Dave, Bob, Jason, Ray, Leo, we'll get to all of you.
[02:27:20.695 --> 02:27:21.796]  But we've got three minutes until break.
[02:27:22.397 --> 02:27:26.740]  Here they are saying, we built an AI to run the world.
[02:27:26.820 --> 02:27:27.721]  And they've done it.
[02:27:28.041 --> 02:27:30.122]  And now they know what you're going to order before you order it.
[02:27:30.863 --> 02:27:31.603]  There's a poll out.
[02:27:31.643 --> 02:27:34.365]  People trust the NSA more than they trust Google.
[02:27:34.425 --> 02:27:35.626]  It's the same thing.
[02:27:35.967 --> 02:27:37.127]  People need to understand this.
[02:27:38.408 --> 02:27:38.869]  Steve Coyle.
[02:27:40.216 --> 02:27:53.664]  The bottom line is how you just described Google, how you've just described their ultimate goal, is the absolute, should be the absolute controlling thought in people's response against it, Alex.
[02:27:54.445 --> 02:27:59.608]  Everything you just said, I wrote a 380 page book on it, but here's the thing.
[02:28:00.228 --> 02:28:03.090]  I'm trying to make it so easy for everyone that
[02:28:03.510 --> 02:28:07.271]  It encapsulates where we're going, what they want.
[02:28:07.311 --> 02:28:08.651]  They're telling us what they want.
[02:28:08.711 --> 02:28:09.772]  They've said what they're going to do.
[02:28:10.212 --> 02:28:12.493]  And so I'm just telling people this point blank.
[02:28:12.913 --> 02:28:18.574]  If you don't understand everything that is out there coming at you, this is the bottom line.
[02:28:18.654 --> 02:28:20.175]  You are no longer needed.
[02:28:20.235 --> 02:28:22.195]  That's why the middle class has been destroyed.
[02:28:22.575 --> 02:28:25.056]  That's why you don't have a hope for a future.
[02:28:25.396 --> 02:28:27.077]  And that's what we're trying to bring about.
[02:28:27.157 --> 02:28:28.237]  And people matter.
[02:28:28.637 --> 02:28:30.518]  And I say this, screw the machines.
[02:28:30.678 --> 02:28:31.478]  People matter.
[02:28:32.659 --> 02:28:33.564]  That's it.
[02:28:33.725 --> 02:28:36.521]  We've got to understand the system wants to bring us down.
[02:28:37.830 --> 02:28:46.297]  We have to get people to get their life force back, get their capacity to understand that they've got to decide whether they want to live or not.
[02:28:46.317 --> 02:28:50.821]  And they've got to understand their destiny's been taken from them, and that it's not a bunch of work to do this.
[02:28:51.302 --> 02:28:52.183]  It is empowering.
[02:28:52.203 --> 02:28:53.644]  Steve, what is it like?
[02:28:54.124 --> 02:28:58.888]  Is it not invigorating and opens up so many understandings when you face this?
[02:28:58.989 --> 02:29:00.009]  It's not enslaving.
[02:29:00.330 --> 02:29:01.130]  It's empowering.
[02:29:01.191 --> 02:29:02.311]  It is tiring, though.
[02:29:02.952 --> 02:29:07.854]  To actually face reality because your intelligence expands so much.
[02:29:08.214 --> 02:29:09.154]  And this is what they're scared of.
[02:29:18.848 --> 02:29:21.590]  Stay there, stay there, we're coming right back.
[02:29:21.650 --> 02:29:23.311]  We're right back with Steve Quill, dot com.
[02:29:54.432 --> 02:29:57.434]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:58.375 --> 02:30:01.057]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:05.174 --> 02:30:06.815]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[02:30:07.155 --> 02:30:10.936]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[02:30:11.676 --> 02:30:16.017]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[02:30:16.137 --> 02:30:22.939]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[02:30:23.459 --> 02:30:32.522]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:30:32.742 --> 02:30:38.145]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[02:30:38.285 --> 02:30:45.548]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.
[02:30:45.888 --> 02:30:48.169]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:30:48.470 --> 02:30:53.592]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the InfoWarp.

[02:31:24.981 --> 02:31:27.903]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body.
[02:31:28.103 --> 02:31:35.226]  And contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[02:31:35.346 --> 02:31:39.747]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[02:31:40.007 --> 02:31:44.689]  Oxy powder does not require time off work and there's no need for bad tasting concoctions.
[02:31:45.009 --> 02:31:50.453]  Instead, Oxy-Powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[02:31:50.674 --> 02:31:55.918]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.

[02:32:05.425 --> 02:32:11.527]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[02:32:11.567 --> 02:32:14.868]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[02:32:14.888 --> 02:32:16.589]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted.
[02:32:16.669 --> 02:32:22.911]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[02:32:23.011 --> 02:32:28.893]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security, uh, sticking their hands down on the streets?
[02:32:29.053 --> 02:32:32.815]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[02:32:32.995 --> 02:32:35.896]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[02:32:35.916 --> 02:32:44.100]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[02:32:44.360 --> 02:32:46.401]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[02:32:46.461 --> 02:32:47.502]  It's a war against the truth.
[02:32:47.862 --> 02:32:56.612]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[02:33:15.260 --> 02:33:20.602]  You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[02:33:21.323 --> 02:33:25.805]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[02:33:26.325 --> 02:33:30.367]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life.
[02:33:31.187 --> 02:33:32.467]  It's not about food.
[02:33:33.168 --> 02:33:35.769]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[02:33:42.423 --> 02:33:44.164]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:44.585 --> 02:33:47.567]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:33:48.748 --> 02:33:50.490]  Now don't feel overwhelmed by all of this.
[02:33:50.570 --> 02:34:02.219]  The power of billions of humans awake and not infighting with each other and aware of what our destiny could be is a system a trillion times more powerful than whatever AI they dig up.
[02:34:02.580 --> 02:34:08.505]  You notice this AI is off of our thoughts, our emotions to train the neurons of this beast.
[02:34:10.014 --> 02:34:13.797]  While surveilling us, while absorbing us at the same time.
[02:34:14.577 --> 02:34:15.738]  And controlling our destiny.
[02:34:16.218 --> 02:34:22.082]  So they roll out the quote smart technology, the smart meters, the smart refrigerators, the smart phones.
[02:34:23.583 --> 02:34:33.410]  All tracking us, all controlling us, all cheating us, cheating us on our power bills, radiating us, hitting us on all fronts as they grow the wireless control mesh.
[02:34:33.890 --> 02:34:36.512]  As the technological grid like tentacles comes out.
[02:34:37.563 --> 02:34:39.724]  So we just start building new innovations around it.
[02:34:39.764 --> 02:34:40.964]  We start educating people about it.
[02:34:41.264 --> 02:34:45.006]  We start doing little steps, and then those turn into big steps to deal with it.
[02:34:45.446 --> 02:34:46.846]  Steve Quayle is our guest.
[02:34:46.866 --> 02:34:48.507]  We're going right back to him and straight to your calls.
[02:34:49.527 --> 02:34:54.389]  Briefly, if you go to DrugsReport.com, you can see our article.
[02:34:55.049 --> 02:35:00.793]  Up there in the top left-hand corner, Fed scramble for hazmat suits, buying more than a million.
[02:35:00.813 --> 02:35:05.296]  And then we, basically from that article, got the intel from one of the big three.
[02:35:05.336 --> 02:35:09.179]  Won't say it's FedEx, won't say it's DHL, won't say it's UPS.
[02:35:10.933 --> 02:35:11.953]  But we have the documents.
[02:35:12.393 --> 02:35:13.194]  Exclusive U.S.
[02:35:13.214 --> 02:35:18.735]  government orders 250,000 quarter-million hazmat suits to be sent to Dallas.
[02:35:19.556 --> 02:35:22.036]  And the president says, oh, get ready for some more cases.
[02:35:22.636 --> 02:35:24.697]  Clearly covering up until after the election.
[02:35:24.737 --> 02:35:25.797]  That's what my gut told me.
[02:35:26.077 --> 02:35:27.458]  Looks like that's where we're going.
[02:35:28.278 --> 02:35:35.166]  Uh, and a lot of top people have said this is really an Ebola simulant, it's not really Ebola, so they can control it, and it's meant to roll out the vaccine.
[02:35:35.466 --> 02:35:38.189]  That's what Dr. Francis Boyle, who wrote the U.S.
[02:35:38.249 --> 02:35:42.594]  Biological Weapons Law and Terrorism Law and the U.N.
[02:35:42.694 --> 02:35:43.034]  Treaty.
[02:35:43.914 --> 02:35:53.022]  Adopted at the UN said, and he said it's hiding in plain view in the New York Times that they already have the vaccine for mutagens that just popped up in the last six months.
[02:35:53.303 --> 02:35:54.163]  That's impossible.
[02:35:54.544 --> 02:35:57.046]  No one could imagine what it would have merged with or done.
[02:35:57.887 --> 02:35:59.308]  That's how stupid they think we are.
[02:35:59.969 --> 02:36:04.653]  It's a smart meter and two plus two equals five and the Patriot Act's patriotic.
[02:36:04.793 --> 02:36:05.254]  No, it's not.
[02:36:06.411 --> 02:36:08.673]  Headline out of the Washington Post, they're laughing at us.
[02:36:09.074 --> 02:36:10.335]  Surprise!
[02:36:10.795 --> 02:36:15.260]  Controversial Patriot Act power now overwhelmingly used in drug investigations.
[02:36:15.320 --> 02:36:16.021]  No warrants.
[02:36:16.521 --> 02:36:17.502]  No due process.
[02:36:17.562 --> 02:36:18.263]  Breaking your house.
[02:36:18.623 --> 02:36:19.324]  Sneaking peeks.
[02:36:19.404 --> 02:36:20.285]  Plant stuff on you.
[02:36:20.665 --> 02:36:21.887]  Was it for terrorism?
[02:36:24.369 --> 02:36:27.072]  And the DEA uses the NSA to set people up.
[02:36:30.282 --> 02:36:33.230]  We're going to bring Joe Biggs in so he can get seated and talk to Steve Quayle here in a moment.
[02:36:33.251 --> 02:36:37.623]  But Steve, I wanted you to finish your point you were trying to get to at the break of SteveQuayle.com.
[02:36:38.643 --> 02:36:46.206]  Well, first of all, Alex, you know, they have had over, I don't know, a couple hundred dead scientists, as far as relevant to what you're asking me.
[02:36:46.226 --> 02:36:55.330]  The, I think it was number 54 or 57 on my list, it was a gentleman that found a universal antidote for all viruses.
[02:36:55.911 --> 02:37:00.052]  A universal, uh, it was an amazing feat.
[02:37:00.212 --> 02:37:01.313]  He was murdered.
[02:37:01.813 --> 02:37:02.233]  We're good.
[02:37:19.905 --> 02:37:20.486]  At all.
[02:37:20.886 --> 02:37:23.128]  What makes you think they ever will?
[02:37:23.468 --> 02:37:25.810]  That sounds like a pretty simplistic thing, doesn't it, Alex?
[02:37:26.471 --> 02:37:33.416]  If you have listened to them, and nothing they say fits with what you see, wouldn't you be better off?
[02:37:37.288 --> 02:37:54.613]  So, given what we're watching right now, Alex, this is a perfect setup for the implementation of their, you know, not only Agenda 21, that's a given, but this is, how do I say this, there's no longer a future that we're going to say, well, another year, another two years, another three years.
[02:37:54.653 --> 02:37:57.033]  No, they're going for the home run right now.
[02:37:57.334 --> 02:38:03.915]  That's why all the ramping up and the amping up of the rhetoric and all of the new laws are in the books.
[02:38:03.935 --> 02:38:06.336]  Listen, if anybody thinks there's a constitutional republic left,
[02:38:06.796 --> 02:38:07.877]  In functionality.
[02:38:07.977 --> 02:38:08.598]  They're wrong.
[02:38:08.798 --> 02:38:09.559]  There is one.
[02:38:09.619 --> 02:38:10.960]  It's a backbone of our country.
[02:38:11.300 --> 02:38:20.669]  But unfortunately, and this should all law enforcement out there listening, if you're a constitutional law enforcement officer, you also, your family's habits are already programmed in.
[02:38:20.689 --> 02:38:26.955]  And Alex, I've been pleading with law enforcement, loyal constitutional American law enforcement, for 23 years on
[02:38:29.137 --> 02:38:33.861]  You know, not being the victims of what they think they're going to be told.
[02:38:34.061 --> 02:38:48.074]  The contempt for those individuals is so great that as a Border Patrolman told me, who's quit now, is the head of the Border Patrol itself, he said, Steve, they know our phone numbers, they know our bank account numbers, they know everything.
[02:38:48.114 --> 02:38:53.078]  We just saw that, you know, we just saw that in the papers, of the gangs, and you're part of the country.
[02:38:53.118 --> 02:38:54.660]  So the point being, they have it all.
[02:38:55.440 --> 02:39:00.682]  That's right, the criminals in the government are working with the organized crime, and cops aren't stupid on average.
[02:39:01.182 --> 02:39:02.722]  They know how corrupt the system is.
[02:39:03.082 --> 02:39:06.023]  Do they really think they're being trained that the number one enemy is returning veterans?
[02:39:06.584 --> 02:39:08.824]  Well, who else are they going to like, people that are trained to fight?
[02:39:09.084 --> 02:39:11.105]  It's the police, who are mainly veterans.
[02:39:11.365 --> 02:39:12.785]  Because it's the end of man.
[02:39:12.865 --> 02:39:14.146]  It's the end of our age.
[02:39:14.586 --> 02:39:17.347]  It's the rise of the machines, in the words of the globalist.
[02:39:17.887 --> 02:39:19.829]  They preconditioned this with movies like Terminator.
[02:39:19.849 --> 02:39:20.829]  People think it's entertainment.
[02:39:21.310 --> 02:39:22.751]  It's the real plan.
[02:39:23.171 --> 02:39:26.293]  But humanity has to rally and has to fight.
[02:39:26.333 --> 02:39:29.616]  I want to go to phone calls and Joe Biggs has some breaking news here with us.
[02:39:29.896 --> 02:39:30.777]  Reporter Joe Biggs.
[02:39:31.077 --> 02:39:31.838]  Dave in Florida.
[02:39:31.858 --> 02:39:33.159]  You're on the air with Steve Quayle.
[02:39:33.179 --> 02:39:33.559]  Go ahead.
[02:39:36.541 --> 02:39:37.522]  My God.
[02:39:37.542 --> 02:39:38.182]  Do me a favor.
[02:39:38.202 --> 02:39:39.123]  Talk right into your phone.
[02:39:40.864 --> 02:39:45.588]  My Lord says fear not because these things must come to pass.
[02:39:46.753 --> 02:39:48.914]  And, um, it happens in His Word.
[02:39:49.414 --> 02:39:56.858]  God's Word has spoken that, um, we will not be destroyed by this evil.
[02:39:57.058 --> 02:39:58.519]  It will be destroyed by God.
[02:39:58.539 --> 02:39:59.940]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[02:39:59.980 --> 02:40:02.321]  I want to get, I want to get Steve's take on that.
[02:40:02.361 --> 02:40:02.781]  Here's the deal.
[02:40:03.061 --> 02:40:04.482]  You can interpret the Bible 55,000 different ways.
[02:40:07.037 --> 02:40:09.820]  I've read the Bible, and I know it's real.
[02:40:10.020 --> 02:40:14.344]  The point is, is that everybody thinks there's a rapture before all this happens.
[02:40:14.764 --> 02:40:18.107]  Did that ever happen to Christians before, or prophets, or Christ, or anybody?
[02:40:18.788 --> 02:40:18.988]  No.
[02:40:19.148 --> 02:40:21.830]  I mean, did George Washington just win everything because he was a Christian?
[02:40:21.850 --> 02:40:22.351]  He had to fight.
[02:40:23.163 --> 02:40:43.111]  And so what I'm getting at here is the churches are mainly government-run, so they're just saying everything's fine, we're going to get teleported out of here by Scotty on a golden rope, or a stairway to heaven up there, without having to go through this, when the UN admits this year Christians are being attacked, number one persecuted group worldwide, and our government's helping do it.
[02:40:44.011 --> 02:40:46.692]  I appreciate your calls, sir, but your phone was distorted, that's why I let you go quick.
[02:40:47.092 --> 02:40:47.952]  I want to get to all these calls.
[02:40:47.972 --> 02:40:49.373]  Steve Quayle, your take on what he just said.
[02:40:49.713 --> 02:40:52.295]  Well, first of all, that's idealistic.
[02:40:52.375 --> 02:40:53.436]  It's not even realistic.
[02:40:53.516 --> 02:40:56.017]  And I would encourage a man to read his Bible.
[02:40:56.077 --> 02:40:59.820]  Jesus said, if the days weren't shortened, there'd be no flesh left alive.
[02:41:00.120 --> 02:41:02.061]  Yet, for the elect's sake, God's going to intervene.
[02:41:02.141 --> 02:41:09.766]  And Alex, I believe that as more people rise up, stand up, that we have a dam-like ability to hold them accountable.
[02:41:09.887 --> 02:41:15.130]  God has intervened for me against every enemy, and it humbles me just constantly.
[02:41:15.210 --> 02:41:18.152]  If I told people all this stuff, it's beyond a movie.
[02:41:18.492 --> 02:41:19.433]  Just constant.
[02:41:19.833 --> 02:41:26.798]  And I just fear for those that try to do bad stuff to me, because every time, praise God, they get torn to pieces without me doing a thing.
[02:41:26.818 --> 02:41:37.326]  Right, and look, let's look at all the Syrian Christians, I mean, and this administration, I don't know if you've heard me say this, but I do no longer, I will not call the White House a White House, it's a slaughterhouse.
[02:41:37.647 --> 02:41:43.071]  Not one word has been spoken out against the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Christians.
[02:41:43.451 --> 02:41:50.996]  Beheaded, disemboweled, chopped up, little babies, babies with their heads ripped off by the foot of someone on it, and yet there's silence.
[02:41:51.016 --> 02:41:54.038]  So I say to all those people, you're the ones with fear.
[02:41:54.238 --> 02:41:56.940]  Don't say that we're putting fear on you.
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:57.681]  We're defining it.
[02:41:57.721 --> 02:42:05.046]  And Jesus himself said that if, you know, if he didn't shorten the days, that there'd be no flesh left alive.
[02:42:05.086 --> 02:42:06.386]  That's how evil it is.
[02:42:06.587 --> 02:42:12.871]  Well, we need to do what Christ did, and be Christ-like, and go out and get in the face of these money changers, get in the face of the system, and rebuke it.
[02:42:13.571 --> 02:42:16.413]  And I don't think that caller was so much mad at us, but I did hear it.
[02:42:16.654 --> 02:42:18.035]  It's like, God's coming!
[02:42:18.175 --> 02:42:19.036]  God will take care of it!
[02:42:19.176 --> 02:42:19.976]  This is scaring me!
[02:42:19.996 --> 02:42:22.058]  You know, I'm not here telling you this to scare you.
[02:42:22.138 --> 02:42:28.563]  I believe you're men, and you're women, and we can organize and stand against this for our very souls, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:42:29.384 --> 02:42:30.224]  Let's move quickly.
[02:42:30.284 --> 02:42:32.126]  Jason in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[02:42:33.775 --> 02:42:34.215]  Hey guys.
[02:42:34.736 --> 02:42:35.797]  Pleasure to talk to both of you.
[02:42:36.097 --> 02:42:42.382]  First, I'll say that my ninth grader, how tough it is to get him to actually go to the library and open up actual books to get his information.
[02:42:42.402 --> 02:42:44.103]  He only relies on the computer.
[02:42:44.123 --> 02:42:45.044]  That bothers me.
[02:42:45.444 --> 02:42:48.206]  Number two, Steve Quill, I'd like to know your take on the Eurontra book.
[02:42:48.606 --> 02:42:55.732]  Number three, if you guys have ever talked to Dr. Boyd Graves, he figured out that AIDS was race-specific back in 1992.
[02:42:55.852 --> 02:43:01.196]  And last point... Well, that's actually... I mean, that was known in the 80s that it was race-specific.
[02:43:02.205 --> 02:43:04.707]  Yeah, but Dr. Boyd Gray is a great guest.
[02:43:04.727 --> 02:43:05.687]  I don't know if you can find him.
[02:43:05.987 --> 02:43:07.368]  Last part, Cameron, North Carolina.
[02:43:07.408 --> 02:43:09.189]  There was an Ebola victim who died.
[02:43:09.209 --> 02:43:10.950]  It was on the news for maybe a day and a half.
[02:43:11.411 --> 02:43:12.711]  You cannot find it anywhere.
[02:43:12.852 --> 02:43:14.753]  I know, they had him dying in Houston, you name it.
[02:43:15.233 --> 02:43:16.594]  There's definitely cover up.
[02:43:17.034 --> 02:43:18.615]  Cameron, North Carolina is near Fort Bragg.
[02:43:18.655 --> 02:43:19.295]  That's my point.
[02:43:19.315 --> 02:43:20.996]  Cameron, North Carolina is near Fort Bragg.
[02:43:21.337 --> 02:43:22.678]  So, that's it guys.
[02:43:22.698 --> 02:43:23.678]  I appreciate what you do.
[02:43:23.718 --> 02:43:24.318]  God bless you.
[02:43:24.379 --> 02:43:25.379]  God bless you, Jason.
[02:43:25.399 --> 02:43:26.320]  We're all in it together, man.
[02:43:27.125 --> 02:43:28.166]  That's why I say don't thank me.
[02:43:28.286 --> 02:43:29.147]  We're in this together.
[02:43:29.367 --> 02:43:30.649]  We're in a boat bailing together.
[02:43:30.669 --> 02:43:31.610]  People are like, thank you, Alex.
[02:43:31.630 --> 02:43:32.230]  I'm like, what?
[02:43:32.250 --> 02:43:33.151]  Let's get bailing here.
[02:43:33.772 --> 02:43:37.596]  Let's go ahead and go to, well, comments on what Jason said, Steve Quayle.
[02:43:37.636 --> 02:43:39.277]  Well, I'll just deal with your answer.
[02:43:39.377 --> 02:43:42.120]  It's new age channeled psychic nonsense.
[02:43:42.480 --> 02:43:43.401]  That's my opinion.
[02:43:43.461 --> 02:43:44.482]  Let's go to the next caller.
[02:43:45.063 --> 02:43:46.725]  Ray in California, you're on the air.
[02:43:49.957 --> 02:43:51.538]  Go ahead, sure.
[02:43:51.879 --> 02:43:53.921]  Okay, you've heard me before.
[02:43:54.381 --> 02:43:56.643]  I have a quick question for Steve.
[02:43:56.823 --> 02:44:05.331]  Steve, I think we're beyond the Book of Revelation currently because I think over one-third of the waters have been destroyed between the BP oil spill and the Fukushima Daiichi incident.
[02:44:05.351 --> 02:44:05.812]  What do you think?
[02:44:06.661 --> 02:44:07.121]  Thanks, Nicole.
[02:44:36.641 --> 02:44:37.641]  Complete blackout.
[02:44:37.681 --> 02:44:38.342]  It's a lie.
[02:44:38.462 --> 02:44:41.843]  And knowledge is exponentially increasing, but ignorance is accelerating.
[02:44:42.263 --> 02:44:42.923]  Yep.
[02:44:43.003 --> 02:44:45.324]  Knowledge, knowledge everywhere, but not a drop to drink.
[02:44:46.205 --> 02:44:47.025]  Thank you so much.
[02:44:47.245 --> 02:44:49.266]  Let's go to, who's up first here?
[02:44:50.646 --> 02:44:51.126]  GCN?
[02:44:51.166 --> 02:44:52.167]  Who should I go to next?
[02:44:52.807 --> 02:44:54.227]  Let's talk to Bob in Missouri.
[02:44:54.287 --> 02:44:55.108]  Bob, you're on the air.
[02:44:55.148 --> 02:44:55.448]  Go ahead.
[02:44:56.912 --> 02:45:03.981]  Hey, I just want to call and encourage you guys and encourage your listeners to understand the odds of us being a Steve or an Alex are zero.
[02:45:04.422 --> 02:45:06.664]  We can be informed, involved.
[02:45:07.025 --> 02:45:08.427]  Don't get tired of doing good.
[02:45:08.987 --> 02:45:11.391]  Constantly keep teaching people around you.
[02:45:11.771 --> 02:45:12.592]  Be the influence.
[02:45:12.652 --> 02:45:13.193]  Be the light.
[02:45:14.062 --> 02:45:16.004]  That you can be in your society.
[02:45:16.305 --> 02:45:17.767]  Everybody has a sphere of influence.
[02:45:17.867 --> 02:45:24.034]  Now, if you want to be that single domino and just be out there by yourself, you're not going to be able to touch anybody.
[02:45:24.355 --> 02:45:30.943]  But you put that domino next to a row of a billion dominoes and you tip it, then you reach more people and more people.
[02:45:31.263 --> 02:45:32.465]  And that's the way we win the battle.
[02:45:33.866 --> 02:45:36.488]  Absolutely, and we stop it by infighting.
[02:45:36.788 --> 02:45:39.189]  They want us infighting on race and all this other stuff.
[02:45:39.209 --> 02:45:56.439]  We have to come together on valuing human life, human dignity, and valuing God's gifts that we were given, not always just putting humanity down by these globalists who fly around in luxury jet airplanes, the Google executives and people with up to like 20 hookers,
[02:45:57.359 --> 02:45:59.481]  And then they think they're going to merge with machines and become God.
[02:45:59.501 --> 02:46:01.183]  I'm not bashing them for liking women.
[02:46:01.443 --> 02:46:10.892]  The whole point is, they're humans like us, but they're under such evil influence that they really believe at Microsoft and everywhere, and that's really evil, that they're going to take over.
[02:46:11.012 --> 02:46:12.474]  And it's just not going to happen.
[02:46:12.914 --> 02:46:14.395]  We already know their plan.
[02:46:14.856 --> 02:46:18.459]  So even though they're going to get a lot of it done, they're going to be destroyed.
[02:46:18.940 --> 02:46:21.822]  And everyone in their gut who has discernment knows
[02:46:22.623 --> 02:46:26.049]  This AI beast is going to turn on them.
[02:46:26.570 --> 02:46:29.756]  There is no way... These people are morons!
[02:46:30.938 --> 02:46:31.499]  You know what?
[02:46:31.880 --> 02:46:33.803]  I just wonder after listening to Captain Crunch...
[02:46:34.577 --> 02:46:45.206]  And all the people along the way with Steve Jobs and that other Jack Legge over at Microsoft and all the, man, where do they get to the point where they sell their souls?
[02:46:45.546 --> 02:46:46.627]  I just don't see that.
[02:46:47.148 --> 02:46:48.129]  I love humanity.
[02:46:48.269 --> 02:46:49.089]  I want everybody.
[02:46:49.490 --> 02:46:50.471]  I'm so sick and tired.
[02:46:51.211 --> 02:46:53.193]  My ancestors came from Ireland.
[02:46:53.333 --> 02:46:54.534]  We never owned a slave one.
[02:46:54.654 --> 02:46:56.336]  I mean, I can go back 400 years.
[02:46:56.396 --> 02:46:57.236]  We never owned a slave.
[02:46:57.296 --> 02:46:59.979]  I'm tired of them shoving the gay thing down my throat.
[02:47:00.559 --> 02:47:01.660]  Saying I'm a homophobic.
[02:47:01.901 --> 02:47:03.122]  I'm tired of them saying I'm a racist.
[02:47:03.442 --> 02:47:04.083]  I'm not a racist!
[02:47:04.123 --> 02:47:07.046]  My UPS guy's a black guy!
[02:47:07.066 --> 02:47:08.268]  No, no, I get all that.
[02:47:08.568 --> 02:47:11.231]  It's about making you feel like you're bad while they're killing everybody.
[02:47:11.491 --> 02:47:12.072]  God bless you.
[02:47:12.092 --> 02:47:12.973]  Steve Quayle comments.
[02:47:13.715 --> 02:47:16.056]  Well, first of all, it's a transfer of evil.
[02:47:16.116 --> 02:47:18.577]  Woe unto those who call evil good and good evil.
[02:47:18.957 --> 02:47:22.898]  They've turned the world upside down and everything that's evil in their eyes is right.
[02:47:22.998 --> 02:47:25.519]  Everything that's right in God's eyes is wrong.
[02:47:25.659 --> 02:47:30.421]  And again, the one who comes to kill, to destroy, and to steal is Lucifer.
[02:47:30.481 --> 02:47:37.383]  They already have sold their souls, by the way, and you don't get to be where those guys are unless you basically make a pact.
[02:47:37.483 --> 02:47:38.464]  Now there's more beheadings happening?
[02:48:07.259 --> 02:48:08.319]  Are in your country.
[02:48:08.639 --> 02:48:14.621]  And that's the thing, this absolute filling the airwaves and the videos and YouTubes and with all this gore.
[02:48:14.921 --> 02:48:21.343]  It's desensitizing so when they bring it here, you will not act up or rise up against it.
[02:48:21.423 --> 02:48:26.344]  And because we have not acted up, rise up, and stood with the Christian brethren being slaughtered.
[02:48:26.364 --> 02:48:32.185]  I'm talking about the megachurches and all the 26,000 churches on the clergy response teams.
[02:48:32.565 --> 02:48:33.506]  Shame on them.
[02:48:33.786 --> 02:48:34.526]  Shame on them.
[02:48:36.021 --> 02:48:39.704]  Now I'm going to skip this network break so we have more time to go to Joe Biggs who's with us.
[02:48:39.725 --> 02:48:43.548]  Then we're going to go to Leo, Stacey, Dave, Abby, and others that are patiently holding.
[02:48:44.009 --> 02:48:53.597]  Joe Biggs goes out and does Man on the Streets every week here in Austin, Texas, down at the University of Texas and other areas.
[02:48:54.645 --> 02:49:10.914]  And we saw an article yesterday trending, more college students support post-birth abortions, and then that harkened back to articles in the Journal of Medical Ethics saying that it was very moral if you wanted to kill your child up to age three, even if they didn't have a problem, or if the state wants to kill.
[02:49:11.275 --> 02:49:15.657]  And then, you know, it's kind of moral now to just put troops on death lists and not give them care.
[02:49:15.677 --> 02:49:23.262]  And when you go out and talk to trendies, if you say, for the state or for Obama, we want to kill the babies, or kill small children, they say, of course.
[02:49:24.366 --> 02:49:25.547]  It'll give me something more?
[02:49:25.667 --> 02:49:35.134]  They believe in this predatory, cannibalistic mindset, and 13 out of 30 people, and some of the others were on the fence, so it's about half.
[02:49:36.425 --> 02:49:42.807]  About half the people he talked to said, yes, let's have post-birth abortions, which is infanticide.
[02:49:42.907 --> 02:49:45.168]  It's an oxymoron, but that's how they're selling it.
[02:49:45.888 --> 02:49:48.589]  And so, you know, prove... I mean, this is a liberal thing.
[02:49:48.629 --> 02:49:54.731]  I mean, you know, we need to kill children up to age 5, because now they're saying age 5, and it's the new super-trendy thing.
[02:49:55.392 --> 02:49:57.472]  So, Joe Biggs, we haven't seen the video yet.
[02:49:57.492 --> 02:50:03.114]  It'll be on the Nightly News tonight, or if we get behind, it'll be premiered on the radio slash TV tomorrow.
[02:50:04.895 --> 02:50:14.203]  We thought UT students were dumb when they wanted to bring Ebola patients to their homes, because we said, for Obama, and they said, yes, it's very racist, we should bring them to our homes.
[02:50:14.804 --> 02:50:15.965]  Of course, they won't really do that.
[02:50:16.045 --> 02:50:17.386]  They want you to take them in your home.
[02:50:19.187 --> 02:50:23.871]  Statistically, it shows these so-called progressives are six times more likely to steal in major studies.
[02:50:24.092 --> 02:50:24.732]  They lie.
[02:50:24.932 --> 02:50:25.913]  They claim they're charitable.
[02:50:25.933 --> 02:50:26.213]  They're not.
[02:50:26.233 --> 02:50:27.915]  It's libertarians and conservatives that are charitable.
[02:50:28.615 --> 02:50:30.857]  We just want to control how we're charitable to real charities.
[02:50:31.698 --> 02:50:35.165]  Tell us what you found, Joe Biggs, and I want to get the take here from Steve Quayle.
[02:50:35.766 --> 02:50:39.012]  I want to tell you right now, Alex, a little piece inside of me died today with this.
[02:50:39.072 --> 02:50:42.359]  I mean, it broke my heart to see
[02:50:43.902 --> 02:50:47.523]  The first person I talked to was willing to sign it.
[02:50:47.923 --> 02:50:49.703]  They read it completely word for word.
[02:50:50.163 --> 02:50:52.864]  Please support the post-birth abortion act of 2014.
[02:50:53.224 --> 02:50:59.406]  This is to emphasize that the moral status of the newborn baby killed is comparable with that of a fetus rather than that of a child.
[02:50:59.746 --> 02:51:05.787]  Therefore, we claim killing a newborn could be ethically permissible in all the circumstances where abortion would be.
[02:51:07.264 --> 02:51:07.784]  And they read it.
[02:51:08.484 --> 02:51:10.425]  And I looked them in the eyes and I watched them read it.
[02:51:11.145 --> 02:51:11.725]  And they signed.
[02:51:11.785 --> 02:51:13.386]  These people are demon creatures.
[02:51:13.906 --> 02:51:19.227]  And one, right down here, Danielle, I won't say the rest of her name, wants to be a future politician.
[02:51:19.708 --> 02:51:22.188]  She is, that is her goal, to be a politician.
[02:51:22.208 --> 02:51:24.949]  A mother, a nurse.
[02:51:25.509 --> 02:51:27.270]  And the thing is, some of them are well spoken.
[02:51:27.290 --> 02:51:29.450]  They go, yes, it's very racist if we don't bring the Ebola patients here.
[02:51:29.971 --> 02:51:30.971]  Or, yes, we need to kill babies.
[02:51:31.874 --> 02:51:34.295]  My stomach was churning the entire time.
[02:51:34.695 --> 02:51:38.736]  It took every ounce of me to hold it back.
[02:51:38.776 --> 02:51:43.678]  When I heard that half of them did it, I said, have Biggs keep asking questions and then get mad at them, because I knew you'd want to.
[02:51:44.158 --> 02:51:45.058]  I said, you've got permission.
[02:51:45.078 --> 02:51:49.420]  So if you want to go back out next week, have more of them do this, and then just tear into them.
[02:51:49.440 --> 02:51:50.480]  Say, what is your problem?
[02:51:50.960 --> 02:51:51.961]  How would you like to die?
[02:51:52.281 --> 02:51:56.082]  Well, some of the ones who refused a sign, as they walked away, I was like, thank you.
[02:51:56.662 --> 02:51:58.803]  Thank you for proving that there is some humanity left.
[02:52:00.124 --> 02:52:01.124]  Did anybody get mad at you?
[02:52:01.265 --> 02:52:10.352]  I had one person, this girl, she didn't sign it, but she walked away and was so upset she started crying.
[02:52:10.392 --> 02:52:11.012]  She has a soul.
[02:52:11.192 --> 02:52:17.317]  And people started walking up and she was screaming as tears were coming out of her eyes, don't sign that petition, don't sign that petition.
[02:52:17.698 --> 02:52:19.439]  And I had to stop what I was doing and walk away.
[02:52:19.459 --> 02:52:21.401]  Wow, she doesn't want to kill children, what a weirdo.
[02:52:21.701 --> 02:52:24.603]  She has a survival instinct, she has a tribal survival mode.
[02:52:24.643 --> 02:52:27.866]  She probably wants our progeny to have space bases and
[02:52:28.446 --> 02:52:29.587]  And control their destiny.
[02:52:29.827 --> 02:52:33.871]  She probably wants us to win and not be destroyed by Google and Microsoft.
[02:52:33.911 --> 02:52:34.712]  How dare her?
[02:52:34.852 --> 02:52:35.933]  She sat there for 10 minutes.
[02:52:36.013 --> 02:52:37.794]  Like, it makes me want to tear up.
[02:52:38.034 --> 02:52:39.295]  Like, please don't sign that.
[02:52:39.375 --> 02:52:39.856]  Please don't.
[02:52:39.996 --> 02:52:40.817]  Did you get an interview with her?
[02:52:40.857 --> 02:52:41.317]  Explained to her?
[02:52:41.497 --> 02:52:43.078]  I talked to her afterwards.
[02:52:43.139 --> 02:52:44.139]  We have that on camera.
[02:52:44.159 --> 02:52:45.180]  But I mean, she's like, please don't.
[02:52:45.200 --> 02:52:46.021]  That's all another tape.
[02:52:46.241 --> 02:52:48.182]  She said, please don't tell me you support this whatsoever.
[02:52:48.202 --> 02:52:49.062]  And I was like, no, no, no.
[02:52:49.082 --> 02:52:52.044]  I was like, but there's a trend going around in these major campuses.
[02:52:52.064 --> 02:52:54.345]  Well, they're teaching it at Princeton and Harvard.
[02:52:54.745 --> 02:52:55.746]  Well, you know they're teaching it.
[02:52:55.766 --> 02:52:57.707]  They got death lists for veterans, man.
[02:52:57.787 --> 02:52:58.647]  Yeah.
[02:52:58.667 --> 02:53:00.868]  They won't even give them heart surgery if they're 50 years old.
[02:53:01.349 --> 02:53:05.791]  And up to five years old, they say, because up until a child is five years old, they're not self-aware.
[02:53:06.591 --> 02:53:08.894]  They go, well, how far can you remember back your first memory?
[02:53:08.934 --> 02:53:09.734]  Most people say five.
[02:53:10.015 --> 02:53:17.342]  And then now, notice they're arguing that we're not conscious anyways, and are just robots by stimuli, that it's all nature, not nurture.
[02:53:17.623 --> 02:53:20.886]  See, they always tell us we don't have a soul, while they quest for immortality.
[02:53:20.906 --> 02:53:21.927]  They know we got a soul.
[02:53:22.187 --> 02:53:26.512]  They're soul suckers, and the way to suck our soul is to get us to believe we don't have one.
[02:53:27.230 --> 02:53:34.453]  I had one guy, when I told him, I said, hey, do you want to help empower women, give women the right to have abortions post-birth?
[02:53:34.933 --> 02:53:36.334]  He goes, whoa, that just sounds crazy.
[02:53:36.374 --> 02:53:37.134]  I don't know if I could do that.
[02:53:37.154 --> 02:53:38.054]  I was like, well, at least read it.
[02:53:38.534 --> 02:53:40.295]  Then he reads it and signs it.
[02:53:41.756 --> 02:53:42.016]  You know?
[02:53:42.036 --> 02:53:44.717]  Steve Quayle, what do you make of this?
[02:53:45.814 --> 02:53:50.097]  Well, they love death rather than life, and let's do another survey.
[02:53:50.277 --> 02:54:03.146]  You know, have Joe Grom say, do you believe that since so many college students are graduating without a job, that we should have a euthanasia bill to basically take away the college students who are looking for a job?
[02:54:03.166 --> 02:54:04.146]  Oh yeah, ask that next!
[02:54:04.687 --> 02:54:10.110]  Yes, and in order to make way for those who are still in college that then will have the opportunity to have a job.
[02:54:10.130 --> 02:54:10.610]  They'll sign it.
[02:54:10.751 --> 02:54:11.231]  They'll sign it.
[02:54:11.451 --> 02:54:20.916]  Well I was thinking about having two, and having this one, and if they refuse to sign this, be like, well do you support, or will you sign this, saying that you would kill the people who are willing to sign somebody.
[02:54:21.256 --> 02:54:22.376]  It's just, it's ridiculous.
[02:54:22.396 --> 02:54:23.477]  No, but Steve's idea is great.
[02:54:23.537 --> 02:54:29.380]  I bet half of them, just usually half, will sign to kill, to kill 55 year olds to get their job.
[02:54:29.420 --> 02:54:30.000]  You gotta think of this.
[02:54:30.500 --> 02:54:31.361]  It took me 45 minutes.
[02:54:31.381 --> 02:54:32.641]  45 minutes, that's it.
[02:54:34.892 --> 02:54:35.773]  To get 30 signatures.
[02:54:36.593 --> 02:54:37.594]  To get the half of 30.
[02:54:37.654 --> 02:54:39.796]  Talk to 30 people and get half of that.
[02:54:39.816 --> 02:54:41.237]  That's two minutes apiece.
[02:54:41.297 --> 02:54:42.518]  Yeah, that's mind-blowing.
[02:54:43.559 --> 02:54:46.561]  I mean, literally, it took so much.
[02:54:46.601 --> 02:54:54.407]  I was bouncing up and down trying to be positive and all I wanted to do was just scream because I couldn't believe the first person who walked up to me signed.
[02:54:55.706 --> 02:54:56.207]  Incredible.
[02:54:56.247 --> 02:54:57.448]  Let's go back to some calls.
[02:54:57.488 --> 02:55:00.230]  We're doing five minutes overdrive today with Steve Quayle, SteveQuayle.com.
[02:55:00.550 --> 02:55:02.071]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[02:55:02.412 --> 02:55:05.334]  Leo in MA, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:55:06.535 --> 02:55:07.956]  Hi, thanks for taking the call.
[02:55:07.976 --> 02:55:15.103]  Last time I spoke to you, if you remember, I referred to the Hydra that is out there, so we can't blame any one specific organization.
[02:55:15.423 --> 02:55:20.247]  Anyway, I'm really up for an Oscar-type
[02:55:20.945 --> 02:55:47.115]  uh... award ceremony for us i'd like to call it the king george third awards and we should have also have a got gullibility test that could go viral and where you wouldn't when you win the gullibility test you lose uh... i was learned something a long time back in terms of professor jerome letwin at MIT and he said that he came into church and said that uh... the reason the jackboots
[02:55:47.813 --> 02:55:48.073]  I hear you.
[02:55:48.093 --> 02:55:49.134]  Do you have a question for Steve?
[02:55:49.174 --> 02:55:50.494]  Well, we're almost out of time.
[02:56:09.304 --> 02:56:10.004]  I agree.
[02:56:10.024 --> 02:56:17.651]  We should write roadmaps and have other people write roadmaps and debate the roadmaps and think about different plans and work off things that have worked against the globalists.
[02:56:17.771 --> 02:56:18.131]  I agree.
[02:56:18.652 --> 02:56:19.112]  Steve Quayle.
[02:56:19.453 --> 02:56:19.913]  Thank you, Colin.
[02:56:20.734 --> 02:56:22.956]  Well, Alex, I mean, it's all laid out there.
[02:56:22.976 --> 02:56:29.021]  The bottom line is when people start reading the documents, I mean, just a simple question to people.
[02:56:30.402 --> 02:56:38.164]  That one of the leading think tanks in America is saying that by 2025, that 80% of the population will no longer exist.
[02:56:38.424 --> 02:56:41.264]  Have you thought about how they're going to kill that many people?
[02:56:41.504 --> 02:56:42.224]  Make it simple.
[02:56:42.244 --> 02:56:45.645]  I'll tell you what, most people want someone else to do it for them.
[02:56:45.705 --> 02:56:54.987]  I'm not saying this guy is, but what everyone has to do is each man has to man up, and they have to stand up, and they have to start absolutely... They need a roadmap.
[02:57:07.578 --> 02:57:08.099]  You know what?
[02:57:08.379 --> 02:57:12.363]  These people have a covenant with death, and I'm telling you, they're plugged in the board.
[02:57:12.423 --> 02:57:15.066]  And by the way, even Hydra have a central processing.
[02:57:15.387 --> 02:57:20.272]  Even though they have individual cells, even the Hydra has, if you will, board central.
[02:57:21.294 --> 02:57:23.575]  That's right, and it's a spirit that animates it.
[02:57:23.895 --> 02:57:24.555]  We're going to go to break.
[02:57:24.635 --> 02:57:26.615]  In five more minutes, Steve Quill will take a few final calls.
[02:57:26.635 --> 02:57:29.176]  We're going to put Steve on hold here real quick as we go to break.
[02:57:29.476 --> 02:57:31.017]  SteveQuill.com is his excellent site.
[02:57:31.077 --> 02:57:32.417]  InfoWars.com is our site.
[02:57:33.077 --> 02:57:37.639]  This is breaking and InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and DrudgeReport.com.
[02:57:37.959 --> 02:57:46.241]  Government agencies scrambled to purchase hazmat suits by the millions, and then we discovered through a whistleblower today, 250,000 more to Dallas, and Obama says,
[02:57:51.004 --> 02:57:52.305]  Prepare for more Ebola cases.
[02:57:52.325 --> 02:57:53.666]  This is going to be after the election.
[02:57:54.847 --> 02:57:55.788]  They are covering it up.
[02:57:55.808 --> 02:58:00.911]  People vomiting, dying on airplanes, dying in Dallas, dying in North Carolina, dying, being drugged.
[02:58:00.931 --> 02:58:02.532]  I'm going to tell you, something's going on.
[02:58:02.793 --> 02:58:04.174]  And if it isn't Ebola, it's something else.
[02:58:04.634 --> 02:58:06.435]  What about people disappearing, media?
[02:58:07.216 --> 02:58:08.297]  It's just like a third world country.
[02:58:08.317 --> 02:58:14.701]  You're not going to report on medical doctors come on and say, at the hospital, I've talked to the medical doctors, the feds are disappearing people.
[02:58:15.262 --> 02:58:16.743]  The border patrol, we have them on by name.
[02:58:16.763 --> 02:58:18.104]  They're disappearing people into vans.
[02:58:19.264 --> 02:58:19.964]  This is illegal.
[02:58:20.544 --> 02:58:22.965]  And the cowardly media just lines up and does what they're told.
[02:58:23.405 --> 02:58:24.805]  That's the creed of slaves.
[02:58:25.225 --> 02:58:26.806]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:58:26.906 --> 02:58:32.207]  I personally am getting ready with Survival Shield X2, Lung Cleanse, you name it, InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:58:32.587 --> 02:58:40.048]  And your purchase of all the great products, whether it's a Molon law-based shirt, or a film or a book to wake up other people, supports this overall command base.
[02:58:40.388 --> 02:58:42.309]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:58:42.629 --> 02:58:46.169]  We'll be back in 60, it's actually 70 seconds, in overdrive.
[02:58:46.770 --> 02:58:48.610]  Nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[02:58:49.210 --> 02:58:53.214]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:55.135 --> 02:58:57.598]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:58:57.778 --> 02:58:58.799]  Check it out today.
[02:58:59.279 --> 02:59:04.904]  I have set out to bring you the most hardcore, cutting-edge supplements and nutraceuticals bar none.
[02:59:05.044 --> 02:59:07.466]  And that's what you'll find at Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:07.647 --> 02:59:14.753]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[02:59:14.773 --> 02:59:15.433]  We're good to go.
[02:59:35.560 --> 02:59:36.881]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:08.812 --> 03:00:09.716]  Fix bayonets!
[03:00:11.182 --> 03:00:11.623]  It's overdrive.
[03:00:17.407 --> 03:00:18.328]  Fix bayonets.
[03:00:18.949 --> 03:00:25.935]  We are now entering overdrive with your host, Alex Jones, broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:00:26.495 --> 03:00:30.179]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:30.199 --> 03:00:36.164]  By the way, I'm not bragging, but Oxford Cambridge have asked me to come speak to their main chambers.
[03:00:36.584 --> 03:00:41.989]  Haven't had time or energy to go, and I was invited to meet with some super high-level people repeatedly.
[03:00:42.049 --> 03:00:42.430]  I mean, at the
[03:00:43.090 --> 03:00:44.711]  So, the globalists are aware of this show.
[03:00:44.751 --> 03:00:45.692]  They know what's going on.
[03:00:46.072 --> 03:00:49.794]  And a lot of people, even within the system and aren't at the very highest rung, don't like it.
[03:00:49.834 --> 03:00:51.234]  They're just scared and don't know what to do.
[03:00:53.015 --> 03:01:00.960]  Steve, I think of all the books you've written, your xenogenesis is the most important to show this devilish attempt at a false creation that's so destructive.
[03:01:01.420 --> 03:01:04.502]  I think everybody should read that book, available at stevequayle.com.
[03:01:05.102 --> 03:01:08.144]  Right now, let's go to Abby in Minnesota.
[03:01:08.184 --> 03:01:08.824]  Thanks for holding.
[03:01:10.085 --> 03:01:10.365]  Pardon me?
[03:01:11.530 --> 03:01:14.511]  Yeah, you guys got distorted audio, just so you know.
[03:01:15.111 --> 03:01:15.451]  Thank you.
[03:01:15.631 --> 03:01:17.372]  RB in Minnesota, not Abby, sorry.
[03:01:17.792 --> 03:01:18.432]  RB, go ahead.
[03:01:19.473 --> 03:01:20.913]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[03:01:21.413 --> 03:01:28.876]  I'd just like to say that right now the median IQ of the average American, the 50th percentile, is currently 100.
[03:01:28.916 --> 03:01:33.818]  The elite, the globalists, have IQs of at least 115, typically around 125 plus.
[03:01:37.319 --> 03:01:49.780]  The ongoing plan is to of course dumb us down even further because they know that once our IQ gets below you know say like 90 once it's down to like 85 there's no way that they can be overthrown.
[03:01:50.587 --> 03:01:56.692]  And the combination of high IQ and psychopathy is absolutely treacherous.
[03:01:57.633 --> 03:02:05.360]  I read a Forbes article and it said that psychopaths are actually disproportionately represented amongst the globalists.
[03:02:06.221 --> 03:02:11.065]  That's well known, that's well known in intelligence agencies, corporations, everywhere, yes.
[03:02:11.837 --> 03:02:26.509]  Yes, and I'll just say like, I remember when I was young, I'd see these little kids and they might be, you know, pulling off the legs of frogs and spiders and I just slowly backed away and say, hey, I don't want to have anything to do with you.
[03:02:26.949 --> 03:02:29.391]  And a couple of these people are now in politics.
[03:02:29.551 --> 03:02:31.112]  These are the people who are running things.
[03:02:31.593 --> 03:02:35.696]  These people who are torturing animals, probably stringing up cats by the legs and
[03:02:36.198 --> 03:02:38.800]  Cutting out their end trials, you know, just for fun.
[03:02:39.441 --> 03:02:39.941]  Just laughing.
[03:02:40.321 --> 03:02:42.343]  You're a powerful caller, sir.
[03:02:42.363 --> 03:02:43.484]  You're absolutely right.
[03:02:44.265 --> 03:02:52.291]  We should do whole shows about psychopaths are thought to be genetic, but they're actually on the rise, like the system is creating them artificially.
[03:02:52.932 --> 03:02:54.833]  Steve Coyle, your comment on what he just said.
[03:02:54.853 --> 03:03:01.679]  Well, I agree, and I would say this, the greatest source of creating that, Alex, along with other social disorders, are the
[03:03:02.399 --> 03:03:13.123]  Uh, video games, and you know, for the first time in history, half a billion dollars was spent, and I'm not a gamer, so I don't know them all by plan, but look, we really do embrace death.
[03:03:13.463 --> 03:03:14.144]  We have the choice.
[03:03:14.264 --> 03:03:21.126]  We can embrace Lucifer and death, or we can pray, uh, embrace Jesus and eternal life, and the principles of Jesus are amazing.
[03:03:21.426 --> 03:03:30.910]  He, the time he got the most angry was with the bankers in the temple, and unfortunately, people who are going to dead churches with what I call pukes in the pulpit, a puke in the pulpit,
[03:03:31.030 --> 03:03:32.731]  We're good to go.
[03:03:52.743 --> 03:03:59.428]  Demons from hell and their fallen angel handlers get away with genocide, and that's what propels me.
[03:04:00.048 --> 03:04:01.309]  God loves the world.
[03:04:01.369 --> 03:04:02.490]  Jesus died for it.
[03:04:02.850 --> 03:04:15.699]  And also, Alex, the bottom line is that everything that people are seeing now, what they admit to, you know, there's Google and every one of the high-tech firms was ultimately set up, funded by the intelligence agencies.
[03:04:15.740 --> 03:04:16.780]  They want total control.
[03:04:16.820 --> 03:04:17.541]  They are the Borg.
[03:04:18.663 --> 03:04:23.145]  That's right, it is the Hydra, because all these agencies are the same group, and it just all goes back to the central system.
[03:04:23.425 --> 03:04:26.267]  I'm sorry to the other callers, Dave and Dave and Stacey and Dan.
[03:04:26.287 --> 03:04:28.047]  We'll have to have Steve back very soon.
[03:04:28.308 --> 03:04:31.769]  Steve Quayle, SteveQuayle.com, thank you so much for your time, God bless you.
[03:04:31.789 --> 03:04:33.050]  Thanks Alex, bye bye.
[03:04:33.950 --> 03:04:39.593]  Oh, simply... Steve Quayle, the first hour was powerful as well, and it's just all real.
[03:04:40.413 --> 03:04:42.854]  And I'm sitting here talking about this stuff, and it's just all happening.
[03:04:43.515 --> 03:04:46.196]  And at the bottom of the rabbit hole, my analysis is, it's spiritual.
[03:04:48.092 --> 03:04:48.413]  It is.
[03:04:49.053 --> 03:04:50.215]  And the enemy knows that, too.
[03:04:50.315 --> 03:04:51.837]  I mean, it's serious.
[03:04:52.197 --> 03:04:53.078]  Great job to the crew.
[03:04:53.659 --> 03:04:54.500]  God bless you all.
[03:04:54.600 --> 03:04:56.502]  Nightly News Tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[03:04:56.542 --> 03:04:59.025]  And Lord willing, don't take this show for granted.
[03:04:59.045 --> 03:04:59.605]  I know I don't.
[03:04:59.886 --> 03:05:01.127]  I'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[03:05:01.167 --> 03:05:01.908]  Central, right here.
[03:05:01.928 --> 03:05:03.510]  Please pray for InfoWars.
[03:05:03.590 --> 03:05:04.231]  Please pray for me.
[03:05:14.878 --> 03:05:15.519]  Big Brother.
[03:05:16.200 --> 03:05:17.221]  Mainstream media.
[03:05:17.962 --> 03:05:19.063]  Government cover-ups.
[03:05:19.724 --> 03:05:20.525]  You want answers?
[03:05:21.306 --> 03:05:22.187]  Well, so does he.
[03:05:22.848 --> 03:05:26.492]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:05:27.053 --> 03:05:31.117]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:05:33.178 --> 03:05:53.144]  It was four years ago that Paul Joseph Watson found in a pediatrics journal, in fact, the biggest journal, a paper by two professors of bioethics calling for killing children for any reason you feel like up to age three.
[03:05:54.164 --> 03:05:56.825]  This is all part of the eugenics transhumanist movement.
[03:05:57.935 --> 03:06:14.639]  And when we published an article linking directly to the study and directly to the Journal of Pediatrics, for four or five days people said we put a hoax out because they couldn't believe that someone would say something like that openly.
[03:06:15.779 --> 03:06:22.861]  Even though that's mainline bioethics with Peter Singer at Princeton, it's the same in England, the same thing in Australia.
[03:06:22.901 --> 03:06:24.401]  This is what's been pushed for decades.
[03:06:26.158 --> 03:06:28.739]  The end of humanity, having no value in humanity.
[03:06:29.619 --> 03:06:31.619]  So that we'll all just roll over and basically die.
[03:06:33.800 --> 03:06:45.863]  Now fast forward four years later after Paul Joseph Watson's original article, which will you guys print me that, Pediatric Journal calls for babies to be able to be killed up to age three.
[03:06:46.723 --> 03:06:51.364]  Now it's in the College Fix and is in major newspapers.
[03:06:54.341 --> 03:06:57.942]  More college students support post-birth abortion.
[03:06:58.482 --> 03:07:11.245]  Now, with a straight face, it's being announced all over the country, and we're sending Joe Biggs out right now to UT, and I'm guessing half the students will see tomorrow.
[03:07:12.285 --> 03:07:14.606]  Or by the nightly news tonight, I don't know how fast they'll get it put together.
[03:07:15.746 --> 03:07:19.987]  I'm guessing half the students will say, kill children, if the government feels like it.
[03:07:21.783 --> 03:07:27.145]  We're not even talking about killing children that are infirm, as they call them, or mentally retarded.
[03:07:28.185 --> 03:07:31.826]  See, in the politically correct world, you don't use the word retarded, but you kill the children.
[03:07:34.007 --> 03:07:47.371]  Just like they say in Apocalypse Now, we train our fighter pilots to drop napalm on men, women, and children and drop death from the air, but we court-martial them if they write the F-word on the side of their airplane.
[03:07:49.397 --> 03:07:50.658]  This is what I've always noticed.
[03:07:50.858 --> 03:07:58.762]  Oh, the FBI created a fake website to nab somebody doing bomb threats over and over again to a Seattle newspaper.
[03:08:01.603 --> 03:08:06.085]  Well, that sounds like real investigative work to me, but it's, oh, it's such a big deal.
[03:08:06.165 --> 03:08:07.046]  It's so horrible.
[03:08:07.446 --> 03:08:08.486]  It's the end of the world.
[03:08:08.827 --> 03:08:09.287]  Meanwhile,
[03:08:10.779 --> 03:08:14.903]  Major defense contractors have been caught running giant child kidnapping rings and no one got in trouble.
[03:08:15.163 --> 03:08:17.005]  And no one's going to say a word about it.
[03:08:17.345 --> 03:08:18.746]  Even when it's in the Chicago Tribune.
[03:08:19.087 --> 03:08:22.450]  Because that's just so evil and big, we just can't believe that's going on.
[03:08:23.851 --> 03:08:25.753]  The NSA spies on everybody illegally.
[03:08:28.476 --> 03:08:34.862]  But we're going to talk about a cop who punched somebody in the nose.
[03:08:36.155 --> 03:08:36.895]  Which isn't good.
[03:08:37.435 --> 03:08:48.459]  But the point is, they will obsess on some little thing, and act like it's the end of the world, and then massive evil, in the private sector, in the public sector, you name it, is just growing exponentially.
[03:08:49.059 --> 03:08:49.699]  So frustrating.
[03:08:51.080 --> 03:08:53.341]  But here's the article, Paul Watson ought to do a flashback.
[03:08:54.381 --> 03:09:03.824]  We actually sent, I think it was Jakari Jackson out last year on this same subject, and got quite a few Austenites on South Congress to say, yes, abort children after birth.
[03:09:05.879 --> 03:09:09.861]  And this is the idea, we're trash, humans don't have any value, roll over and die.
[03:09:10.501 --> 03:09:33.713]  And more and more I realize this is the absolute center, the key to defeating this entire globalist program is understanding why they want us
[03:09:39.176 --> 03:09:40.677]  Not think of ourselves as valuable.
[03:09:41.058 --> 03:09:52.146]  I think it is the celebration of human achievement and the celebration of human inventiveness and beauty, whether it's opera or literature or people being heroic.
[03:09:52.947 --> 03:09:57.350]  Even though I'll disagree with a war, I can admire someone's courage in it.
[03:09:58.511 --> 03:10:01.373]  It is in that celebration that we defeat the New World Order.
[03:10:02.074 --> 03:10:06.697]  I'm sure of it, and I want to try to codify it into an eloquent soliloquy.
[03:10:06.917 --> 03:10:07.458]  Stay with us.
[03:10:08.976 --> 03:10:09.977]  The experts are clear.
[03:10:10.297 --> 03:10:17.281]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[03:10:17.421 --> 03:10:23.244]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[03:10:23.684 --> 03:10:27.266]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[03:10:27.406 --> 03:10:31.309]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[03:10:31.629 --> 03:10:36.672]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[03:10:36.952 --> 03:10:37.853]  Not our iodine.
[03:10:37.953 --> 03:10:41.535]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[03:10:41.775 --> 03:10:44.097]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[03:11:04.326 --> 03:11:05.587]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[03:11:25.219 --> 03:11:36.068]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[03:11:38.334 --> 03:11:42.215]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[03:11:42.935 --> 03:11:46.056]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[03:11:46.756 --> 03:11:47.596]  Others don't.
[03:11:47.996 --> 03:11:49.877]  We turn jeans inside out.
[03:11:50.137 --> 03:11:51.657]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[03:11:51.917 --> 03:11:54.498]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[03:11:54.798 --> 03:12:01.059]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.

[03:12:06.501 --> 03:12:07.381]  Others don't.
[03:12:08.855 --> 03:12:18.380]  Using unparalleled research and the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[03:12:18.520 --> 03:12:28.285]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[03:12:28.445 --> 03:12:31.367]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[03:12:31.587 --> 03:12:34.409]  And contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients.
[03:12:34.609 --> 03:12:38.691]  Often times full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[03:12:38.811 --> 03:12:43.213]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[03:12:43.473 --> 03:12:45.755]  Oxy powder does not require time off work.
[03:12:45.915 --> 03:12:48.156]  And there's no need for bad tasting concoctions.
[03:12:48.476 --> 03:12:53.918]  Instead, OxyPowder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[03:12:54.138 --> 03:12:59.360]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.
[03:12:59.480 --> 03:13:05.442]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com to get started with OxyPowder or call 1-888-253-3139.
[03:13:15.703 --> 03:13:19.946]  Aborted babies incinerated to heat UK hospitals.
[03:13:21.166 --> 03:13:25.089]  Soylent Green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people.
[03:13:25.329 --> 03:13:31.572]  But now, children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals in the UK.
[03:13:31.592 --> 03:13:36.455]  They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[03:13:36.976 --> 03:13:40.758]  What is the secret of Soylent?
[03:13:41.599 --> 03:13:43.661]  The powdered flesh from dead babies.
[03:13:44.121 --> 03:13:46.304]  Some people believe they can cure disease.
[03:13:46.784 --> 03:13:50.869]  Because of its enormous popularity, Soylent Green is in short supply.
[03:13:51.610 --> 03:13:54.333]  Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.
[03:13:54.613 --> 03:13:57.496]  The supply of Soylent Green has been exhausted.
[03:13:58.197 --> 03:13:59.819]  You must evacuate the area.
[03:14:02.449 --> 03:14:14.332]  The federal court ruled that the shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Bilderberg Group Company, are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring, but we already know.
[03:14:15.012 --> 03:14:16.833]  So enjoy the flavor!
[03:14:16.993 --> 03:14:21.434]  We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death panels and sales taxes.
[03:14:21.614 --> 03:14:23.135]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[03:14:23.575 --> 03:14:25.075]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[03:14:25.435 --> 03:14:26.676]  I'm for regular suicide.
[03:14:26.756 --> 03:14:28.336]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[03:14:28.656 --> 03:14:39.962]  ...is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade up in medical costs?
[03:14:40.002 --> 03:14:44.144]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[03:14:44.364 --> 03:14:50.607]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[03:14:58.880 --> 03:15:01.101]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[03:15:01.481 --> 03:15:05.902]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[03:15:06.382 --> 03:15:08.163]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[03:15:08.883 --> 03:15:17.605]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison guards, on the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[03:15:18.245 --> 03:15:20.726]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[03:15:21.446 --> 03:15:22.828]  The scoops are on their way.
[03:15:23.569 --> 03:15:25.050]  The scoops are on their way.
[03:15:25.070 --> 03:15:28.615]  I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[03:15:28.635 --> 03:15:32.099]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life.
[03:15:32.579 --> 03:15:35.603]  You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[03:15:36.003 --> 03:15:38.105]  We've got to stop them!
[03:15:38.326 --> 03:15:42.090]  It is the secret name Soylent Green.
[03:15:42.768 --> 03:15:44.631]  SILENT BREEDERS PEOPLE!
[03:15:44.711 --> 03:15:46.173]  You gotta stop them.
[03:15:46.593 --> 03:15:47.415]  You gotta tell them.
[03:15:48.276 --> 03:15:50.519]  Next thing they'll be breeding us like cattle.
[03:15:50.919 --> 03:15:51.420]  For food.
[03:15:52.521 --> 03:15:53.262]  You gotta tell them.
[03:15:56.539 --> 03:16:02.444]  It is October 30th, 2014 on this Worldwide Thursday Transmission.
[03:16:03.024 --> 03:16:05.126]  We had him on for one hour earlier this week.
[03:16:05.166 --> 03:16:06.807]  We've got him for two hours today.
[03:16:07.307 --> 03:16:18.796]  Steve Quayle and the New World Order, Technotronic, Technocracy, Scientific, Transhumanist, World Dictatorship, Rise of the Machines, World Government Plan.
[03:16:19.960 --> 03:16:26.946]  We will both be breaking it down from our perspectives today and taking your phone calls one hour into the interview in the third hour.
[03:16:29.388 --> 03:16:35.213]  We have massive, massive Ebola news, and I'll just go to it right now.
[03:16:38.636 --> 03:16:42.760]  I have said over and over again, and you have said it as well, and our guests have all said it,
[03:16:43.882 --> 03:16:47.303]  You don't have to be a genius to see there's a cover-up going on with the Ebola.
[03:16:47.363 --> 03:16:51.964]  Now, we don't know, at least I don't know exactly what the cover-up is, but it's going on.
[03:16:55.525 --> 03:17:11.610]  They're acting suspicious, they're sneaking around, they're turning off default positions on flights into the US, on issuing West African visas, on not quarantining people, on then saying that people that have had Ebola in the US
[03:17:12.659 --> 03:17:16.601]  Gave it to nurses and doctors, but didn't spread it to other people.
[03:17:17.121 --> 03:17:30.207]  When these doctors and nurses are acting like the fictional character who works in a bio lab, in a microbiology lab, in 12 Monkeys with Bruce Willis.
[03:17:31.448 --> 03:17:41.673]  These doctors and nurses are acting like the guy at the end who goes to all the restaurants and basically bowling alleys and books a bunch of flights.
[03:17:42.671 --> 03:17:43.471]  When he's infected.
[03:17:44.752 --> 03:17:46.192]  These are medical doctors and people.
[03:17:46.212 --> 03:17:47.573]  They're all acting very strange.
[03:17:47.613 --> 03:17:54.175]  So, either it's a hoax and it's not going on, or they've turned off the default positions and are trying to spread it.
[03:17:54.615 --> 03:17:59.617]  And I'm not saying the doctors and nurses are actually doing this, but by their actions they are if they really have Ebola.
[03:18:02.138 --> 03:18:03.858]  Or if they were around people that had Ebola.
[03:18:04.318 --> 03:18:09.040]  Why would you send 5,000 US troops into the middle of a hot zone and then send them to Italy
[03:18:11.001 --> 03:18:15.062]  When one patient brought out of Africa into Spain has spread it.
[03:18:16.242 --> 03:18:20.283]  Why would you bring hundreds of troops in who they say are in some cases are sick?
[03:18:20.583 --> 03:18:24.644]  We have a source inside the base at the highest level.
[03:18:24.824 --> 03:18:25.724]  I'll just leave it at that.
[03:18:27.284 --> 03:18:30.665]  In the office at the highest level and there is no quarantine.
[03:18:31.045 --> 03:18:33.386]  There's not even really a gate on the base.
[03:18:33.406 --> 03:18:35.066]  There's just a highway blocker.
[03:18:36.092 --> 03:18:37.833]  A roadblocker at a guard shack.
[03:18:37.853 --> 03:18:39.114]  There's not really a fence.
[03:18:39.575 --> 03:18:41.816]  And there is no quarantine going on.
[03:18:41.836 --> 03:18:48.581]  There's a nurse's station that can hand out aspirin and put band-aids on people's fingers.
[03:18:48.902 --> 03:18:50.523]  The base doesn't even have doctors on it.
[03:18:51.343 --> 03:18:52.304]  It's not a medical base.
[03:18:53.905 --> 03:18:56.467]  And we went and looked up what our source told us and it was all true.
[03:18:56.767 --> 03:18:57.708]  Our source is there.
[03:18:58.829 --> 03:19:00.630]  In the General's office.
[03:19:01.891 --> 03:19:02.732]  I'll just leave it at that.
[03:19:03.853 --> 03:19:05.034]  There is no quarantine.
[03:19:05.996 --> 03:19:10.977]  And most of the troops live off base with their families because a lot of them are special forces officers.
[03:19:12.358 --> 03:19:13.978]  Army special forces.
[03:19:17.479 --> 03:19:18.499]  So that's what's going on.
[03:19:20.200 --> 03:19:23.261]  There is no quarantine at the base in Italy.
[03:19:23.941 --> 03:19:26.321]  And we told you that on Monday.
[03:19:26.601 --> 03:19:29.202]  It's now mainstream news that there's not really a quarantine there.
[03:19:30.963 --> 03:19:32.123]  Why did they tell us there was?
[03:19:35.598 --> 03:19:41.539]  Nothing adds up here except a plan to spread Ebola in the United States.
[03:19:41.579 --> 03:19:46.880]  And I've said over and over again, after the election we'll find out whether this was basically a hoax.
[03:19:47.580 --> 03:19:49.200]  There's real Ebola in Africa.
[03:19:50.941 --> 03:19:58.282]  Whether they're just basically using a few cases of people with it to hype things up, or whether they have covered up the fact that it's been spreading.
[03:19:58.922 --> 03:20:04.523]  And then today, Obama comes out with the chilling statement, Reuters headline,
[03:20:06.036 --> 03:20:16.840]  Americans may still see some Ebola cases, Obama says, and he went on to say, we can't be hermetically sealed.
[03:20:18.801 --> 03:20:25.524]  Now only all the government bunkers that are hermetically sealed, you only have at sight are 30 miles from the White House, buddy.
[03:20:26.710 --> 03:20:28.450]  A hermetically sealed underground bunker.
[03:20:29.231 --> 03:20:42.113]  You only have a railway right underneath the White House, on record, to the Breyer Hotel and other facilities and helicopter pads, where if enemy drones came in and sprayed airborne Ebola, you would go into a hermetically sealed chamber.
[03:20:42.253 --> 03:20:42.633]  That's right.
[03:20:43.033 --> 03:20:45.374]  Only you get to be hermetically sealed.
[03:20:45.914 --> 03:20:48.234]  And only NORTHCOM gets to be hermetically sealed.
[03:20:48.594 --> 03:20:50.835]  We don't get to be hermetically sealed, do we?
[03:20:52.196 --> 03:20:55.879]  By the way, we have the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean between us and Africa.
[03:20:55.899 --> 03:20:57.140]  You know, it straddles the two.
[03:20:58.362 --> 03:21:00.023]  We don't need to be hermetically sealed.
[03:21:00.523 --> 03:21:03.846]  We just need you to stop visas from West Africa.
[03:21:04.447 --> 03:21:07.710]  And we need you to make U.S.
[03:21:08.010 --> 03:21:14.096]  health workers who go out of the hot zone, out of the Ebola hospitals, then they go back to their
[03:21:15.438 --> 03:21:24.409]  Dormitories and they have a self quarantine and stay there for more than 30 days is really what you're supposed to do because it can last 40 and then you get on an airplane and come back.
[03:21:24.489 --> 03:21:25.510]  That's what you do.
[03:21:26.652 --> 03:21:28.113]  That's what you've always done.
[03:21:28.233 --> 03:21:29.815]  And so here's the big enchilada.
[03:21:31.557 --> 03:21:34.882]  The fact that he's now getting people ready to say, see, I told you.
[03:21:36.701 --> 03:21:38.963]  This is like letting out a you-know-what in church.
[03:21:39.563 --> 03:21:42.125]  He's just hoping nobody notices what he's doing.
[03:21:42.746 --> 03:21:43.987]  Shifting around on his chair.
[03:21:44.007 --> 03:21:47.210]  And this is a big sign that Ebola is spreading, in my view.
[03:21:48.170 --> 03:21:57.178]  This is a big sign that, oh, uh, now, it's no big deal, and we can't be hermetically sealed, but I think you may need to expect some more Ebola.
[03:22:00.401 --> 03:22:00.901]  There you go.
[03:22:01.742 --> 03:22:07.447]  It's from a guy who said months ago, there's no way it'll come over here, or then it's unlikely, or, oh, we'll bring healthcare workers here, they won't spread it.
[03:22:07.547 --> 03:22:07.987]  Baloney.
[03:22:08.287 --> 03:22:11.750]  They know full well, you bring in healthcare workers that have got it, they're gonna spread it.
[03:22:13.691 --> 03:22:14.712]  They're spreading it anywhere.
[03:22:15.032 --> 03:22:22.358]  Only Spain and the US are basically dumb enough to bring a bunch of people infected with Ebola in, but they're not dumb.
[03:22:22.759 --> 03:22:26.281]  And remember the rumors that started about three weeks ago in the Washington Free Beacon?
[03:22:26.301 --> 03:22:27.662]  It wasn't a rumor, they had sources.
[03:22:27.923 --> 03:22:28.683]  Drudge linked to it.
[03:22:28.903 --> 03:22:29.464]  We linked to it.
[03:22:33.180 --> 03:22:36.884]  That the White House is planning to bring in foreigners with Ebola?
[03:22:36.964 --> 03:22:39.506]  Well, now it's been announced yesterday that they're looking at doing it.
[03:22:39.907 --> 03:22:40.407]  And why?
[03:22:41.668 --> 03:22:45.552]  Because it's over the top and it's meant to break our will.
[03:22:46.993 --> 03:22:52.239]  Why would the Journal of Pediatrics come out with a paper back in 2012
[03:22:54.548 --> 03:23:01.696]  There was another paper before that, two years before, in 2010, and say it's time to start killing babies up to age three.
[03:23:02.076 --> 03:23:02.857]  Here's the headline.
[03:23:02.977 --> 03:23:08.903]  Ethicists argue killing newborn babies should be allowed in the Journal of Medical Ethics.
[03:23:09.504 --> 03:23:10.845]  It was republished in Pediatrics.
[03:23:12.147 --> 03:23:15.190]  Now, when we published this, people didn't believe us even though we linked to it.
[03:23:17.315 --> 03:23:18.676]  Now, this is being pushed everywhere.
[03:23:18.996 --> 03:23:27.099]  Now it's in collegefix.com, and it links to a bunch of newspapers promoting it, and admits and says it's the new trendy trend.
[03:23:27.119 --> 03:23:29.080]  It says, trending.
[03:23:29.560 --> 03:23:31.901]  More college students support post-birth abortion.
[03:23:32.481 --> 03:23:37.123]  We've already gone out in Austin and about a third of the people want to kill babies for any reason.
[03:23:37.163 --> 03:23:38.624]  Just if you want to kill your kid, go ahead and kill them.
[03:23:40.104 --> 03:23:44.706]  Now, if you spank your child lightly for running out in the street when there are three, they'll take it away from you.
[03:23:44.746 --> 03:23:46.207]  But if you want to kill them, you know, that's fine.
[03:23:47.618 --> 03:23:48.900]  And people say this is over the top.
[03:23:49.661 --> 03:23:54.026]  People, a couple years ago when we first broke this, Infowars.com broke it.
[03:23:55.568 --> 03:23:59.153]  Could not believe it when Drudge linked to it and others linked to it.
[03:23:59.614 --> 03:24:01.176]  Even though it was linked to the Pediatrics Journal.
[03:24:02.503 --> 03:24:05.105]  Back then, people said, you've gone too far with this hoax.
[03:24:05.766 --> 03:24:06.487]  No one could believe it.
[03:24:06.507 --> 03:24:14.814]  Just like seven years ago, or six years ago, when we broke the fact that the Homeland Security said the number one enemy was gun owners, returning veterans, Christians, conservatives, that we would all be targeted.
[03:24:15.034 --> 03:24:16.355]  People thought that was a fake document.
[03:24:16.636 --> 03:24:18.077]  The FBI came out and said, no, it's real.
[03:24:18.497 --> 03:24:19.658]  And Mr. Jones shouldn't have that.
[03:24:21.280 --> 03:24:22.661]  Well, I called the FBI.
[03:24:22.701 --> 03:24:24.483]  I got threatened for having it.
[03:24:24.843 --> 03:24:25.363]  It was real.
[03:24:26.434 --> 03:24:27.375]  Now everybody knows that.
[03:24:27.395 --> 03:24:29.716]  See, this is how they move the Overton window.
[03:24:30.136 --> 03:24:31.818]  And guys, print me the definition of Overton window.
[03:24:31.838 --> 03:24:33.439]  I mean, I know what it is, but I want to read it when we come back.
[03:24:34.760 --> 03:24:36.160]  It's shocking you.
[03:24:36.361 --> 03:24:41.224]  See, at first, you're shocked that they're going to teach your five-year-olds how to have anal sex in public school.
[03:24:41.424 --> 03:24:46.447]  But now, Jocelyn Elders, you know, back in the 90s saying, help five-year-olds masturbate at school.
[03:24:47.068 --> 03:24:48.228]  Now that's not shocking, is it?
[03:24:48.769 --> 03:24:48.969]  See?
[03:24:49.489 --> 03:24:50.570]  Or, hey, let's kill babies.
[03:24:50.590 --> 03:24:51.390]  Let's kill old people.
[03:24:51.410 --> 03:24:51.911]  Death panels.
[03:24:52.291 --> 03:24:53.632]  Remember, oh, there's no death panels now.
[03:24:53.672 --> 03:24:54.332]  Of course there are.
[03:24:54.933 --> 03:24:55.093]  See?
[03:24:56.533 --> 03:24:59.899]  Just like, veterans are terrorists, oh that's not true, now it's all just accepted.
[03:25:00.240 --> 03:25:01.783]  This is how they condition us.
[03:25:02.244 --> 03:25:07.173]  When they say our kids belong to them, 2 plus 2 equals 5, they are conditioning us.
[03:25:09.498 --> 03:25:17.402]  Virtually anyone can hack your cell phone and track your calls, your texts, your emails, your every movement, but only if they can detect a signal.
