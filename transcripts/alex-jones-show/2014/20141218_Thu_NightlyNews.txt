[00:00:00.293 --> 00:00:05.795]  Last night on my orders, America's armed forces began strikes against ISIL targets in Syria.
[00:00:46.324 --> 00:00:48.986]  The people we are fighting today, we funded.
[00:00:49.557 --> 00:00:52.159]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:57.444]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:07.292]  ISIS has grabbed up from the US, from the Saudis, from the Qataris, weapons by the truckload.
[00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:14.318]  And we are now forced to fight against our own weapons, and this body wants to throw more weapons into the mix.
[00:01:27.575 --> 00:01:29.635]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:01:29.735 --> 00:01:30.935]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:01:31.255 --> 00:01:35.396]  It's December 18th, 2014, and that's exactly right, America!
[00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:38.797]  Yeah, where we let other countries tell us how to make our movies.
[00:01:39.177 --> 00:01:46.958]  And not only do we let them tell us how to make our movies like Iron Man 3 or Red Dawn, now if they say, we don't want you to air this movie, we just won't air it.
[00:01:47.278 --> 00:01:51.619]  And now we have the article, Paramount Cancels Alamo Draft House's Team America Screening.
[00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:56.728]  Reportedly, Paramount Pictures has decided not to let the theater chain show the movie at all.
[00:01:57.228 --> 00:02:03.173]  Alamo Draft House sent a message telling their customers that the screening would not take place due to circumstances beyond their control.
[00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:13.661]  See, what had happened was, is Seth Rogen and Jane Franco, they made this little movie called The Interview, in which they go in to assassinate Ken Jeong-un, and it's my understanding there's some type of orgy scene in it.
[00:02:14.181 --> 00:02:16.543]  I wouldn't know because the movie's not supposed to be released.
[00:02:16.843 --> 00:02:18.203]  Because that's what happens here in America.
[00:02:18.223 --> 00:02:19.104]  We have so much freedom.
[00:02:19.384 --> 00:02:24.265]  We let foreign entities show us how to make our movies and also how to promote them or play them at all.
[00:02:24.585 --> 00:02:27.026]  You guys recall Iron Man 3 and also Red Dawn.
[00:02:27.406 --> 00:02:31.827]  They got censored and remade because the Chinese audience didn't like them as they are.
[00:02:32.248 --> 00:02:40.050]  Now Kim Jong Un and his camp supposedly are threatening hack attacks, or I guess already had hack attacks, here in the States because of a movie.
[00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.171]  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.
[00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:45.812]  That's like saying the innocence of Muslims caused the Benghazi attacks.
[00:02:45.892 --> 00:02:47.033]  I don't buy that one bit.
[00:02:47.353 --> 00:02:51.455]  But for more on how this hack attack may not be all that it seems, here's Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:03:02.892 --> 00:03:11.731]  The US government has stridently asserted that North Korea was almost certainly responsible for the Sony hack, with no evidence whatsoever.
[00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.371]  Look at this New York Times headline.
[00:03:14.751 --> 00:03:18.012]  US said to find North Korea ordered cyber attack on Sony.
[00:03:18.393 --> 00:03:24.495]  American officials have concluded that North Korea was centrally involved in the hacking of Sony Pictures computers.
[00:03:24.875 --> 00:03:36.421]  Now if we actually had a real media in the United States, the headline would be something like, no evidence backs up US claim that North Korea ordered cyber attack on Sony.
[00:03:36.861 --> 00:03:38.882]  But because this is the New York Times,
[00:03:39.462 --> 00:03:45.603]  Which is basically a press release outlet for the White House, we get a headline like this.
[00:03:46.403 --> 00:03:53.464]  And it's actually not until halfway down the article that we read, In other words, there's no evidence whatsoever to back up this claim.
[00:03:53.484 --> 00:03:57.525]  As Wired News' Kim Zetta reports, the evidence that North Korea hacked Sony is flimsy.
[00:04:08.297 --> 00:04:14.661]  Sony and the FBI have announced that they've found no evidence so far to tie North Korea to the attack.
[00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:24.628]  In fact, the only evidence that really does indicate anything is that this hack attack on Sony Pictures was an inside job.
[00:04:25.828 --> 00:04:32.553]  As TMZ reports, the people at Sony who are investigating believe the hackers had intimate knowledge of mail systems and their configurations.
[00:04:32.953 --> 00:04:42.721]  They also believe the hackers have knowledge of the internal media distribution systems and the internal IT systems, including human resources and payroll.
[00:04:43.041 --> 00:04:53.689]  And they're suggesting that there could be a link between the huge number of Sony layoffs that have taken place recently and an aggrieved employee that could have been responsible for this hack.
[00:04:54.602 --> 00:05:09.744]  The FBI also suspects that the hack was the work of a disgruntled worker, and that even though the Guardians of Peace group has taken responsibility for breaking into Sony's servers, the group had to have had help from someone familiar with the infrastructure.
[00:05:11.067 --> 00:05:27.283]  After Sony announced yesterday that it would pull the movie The Interview from all cinemas, Paramount followed suit by announcing that Team America, which of course also insults North Korea, would be pulled from theatres nationwide.
[00:05:28.288 --> 00:05:40.611]  But amidst the myriad of accusations and theories as to who is responsible for this hack, be it North Korea or some kind of inside job by a disgruntled employee, here's what they're not telling you.
[00:05:41.491 --> 00:05:51.013]  The two previous cyber attacks that caused anywhere near the alarm created by this Sony hack were done by the US government.
[00:05:52.113 --> 00:06:06.318]  When Alex Jones accused the United States of being behind the Stuxnet virus attack back in 2010, in order to grease the skids for draconian cyber security measures, he was labelled a conspiracy theorist.
[00:06:07.352 --> 00:06:13.858]  Two years later it emerged that the US and Israel were almost certainly responsible for the attack.
[00:06:14.498 --> 00:06:21.905]  And again we saw the same thing with the flame virus aimed at targeting Iran's nuclear program.
[00:06:21.925 --> 00:06:26.248]  It was a conspiracy theory to blame this on the United States and Israel.
[00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:34.635]  Lo and behold the Washington Post subsequently reported US-Israel developed flame computer virus to slow Iranian nuclear efforts.
[00:06:35.441 --> 00:07:00.438]  But of course at the time the blame was solely pinned on foreign actors like Russia just as it is being pinned on North Korea now with the Sony hack in order to justify draconian cyber security measures like the ones that Joe Lieberman called for in giving the White House the same power as China to censor and shut down the internet.
[00:07:01.118 --> 00:07:12.000]  So what do we see now with the Obama administration saying that North Korea is responsible, with no evidence whatsoever, that this is a national security matter?
[00:07:13.493 --> 00:07:18.996]  And that it reiterates the fact that Congress should pass the Cybersecurity Bill.
[00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:21.878]  So now we see this being exploited.
[00:07:21.938 --> 00:07:23.699]  Politicians respond to Sonyhack.
[00:07:23.859 --> 00:07:25.660]  Call for Cybersecurity Bill.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:31.203]  Cybersecurity legislation that has repeatedly stalled in Congress.
[00:07:32.307 --> 00:07:37.809]  is now looking set to get the green light in the aftermath of this Sony hack.
[00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:47.912]  John McCain said in a statement, Congress as a whole must also address these issues and finally pass long overdue comprehensive cyber security legislation.
[00:07:48.792 --> 00:07:53.574]  And just by coincidence, Obama State Department official Catherine Novelli
[00:07:54.494 --> 00:07:59.096]  Was meeting with China's Internet Censorship Czar.
[00:07:59.596 --> 00:08:02.838]  This is the guy overseeing the Great Firewall of China.
[00:08:03.458 --> 00:08:07.680]  The infamous government censorship program over the entire web.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.942]  She was meeting with him at an event in Washington.
[00:08:12.782 --> 00:08:18.346]  Urging cooperation on cyber security between the United States and China.
[00:08:18.906 --> 00:08:29.394]  While, of course, the Obama administration moves to reclassify the Internet under the Telecommunications Act, making it susceptible to FCC control,
[00:08:30.174 --> 00:08:34.797]  Greasing the skids for government oversight and regulation of the web.
[00:08:35.477 --> 00:08:55.769]  So isn't it convenient that right at the time the cyber security legislation is stalled in Congress, as the Obama administration shows its desperation to regulate the internet, now we have this convenient Sony hack that can be used to grease the skids for tightened control.
[00:08:57.076 --> 00:08:57.836]  But what do you think?
[00:08:58.056 --> 00:09:11.502]  Am I a conspiracy theorist for even daring to suggest this premise, just as I was labelled a conspiracy theorist for saying the US was behind Stuxnet and Flame, which later proved to be the case?
[00:09:12.623 --> 00:09:15.384]  Or do you think that this is the work of a disgruntled employee?
[00:09:16.324 --> 00:09:18.325]  The work of a foreign actor like North Korea?
[00:09:19.666 --> 00:09:22.247]  Or is a wider conspiracy afoot?
[00:09:23.345 --> 00:09:25.228]  Let me know what you think in the comments below.
[00:09:25.248 --> 00:09:28.233]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:09:36.243 --> 00:09:39.585]  Cuba move comes as Russia tries to revive ties to Havana.
[00:09:40.026 --> 00:09:54.115]  President Obama's surprise economic and diplomatic opening to Cuba Wednesday comes at a time when Vladimir Putin's Russia has been trying to revive Moscow's once close ties to the Castro regime, a longtime ally of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
[00:09:54.576 --> 00:09:58.999]  Mr. Putin has received support from the Castro regime in Russia's skirmishes with Ukraine this year.
[00:09:59.659 --> 00:10:05.902]  But with Russia's economy cratering this week, Cuba appears to be looking elsewhere for more stable economic support, experts say.
[00:10:06.203 --> 00:10:13.706]  So we see Russia, they're making friends with Cuba, they're making friends with China, going all around the world, doing the best they can to build up their friends.
[00:10:14.827 --> 00:10:22.130]  Us here in the U.S., we're doing everything we can to distance people, to make them mad, to bomb their countries, to tap their diplomats' phones and so forth.
[00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:28.292]  So, you know, I'm not at all happy that Russia is gaining a foothold of a place in the world.
[00:10:28.332 --> 00:10:31.174]  But here in the United States, we're not doing anything to really stop them.
[00:10:31.574 --> 00:10:35.135]  The only thing we're doing is supposedly poking the bear, so to speak.
[00:10:35.515 --> 00:10:37.856]  So let's talk about somebody poking the First Amendment.
[00:10:37.936 --> 00:10:39.037]  It's happening in Tennessee.
[00:10:39.357 --> 00:10:41.718]  Tennessee City outlaws the First Amendment.
[00:10:42.378 --> 00:10:51.565]  In South Pittsburgh, Tennessee, the City Council recently voted 4-1 to approve an all-inclusive social networking policy aimed at discouraging criticism of the government.
[00:10:52.366 --> 00:11:06.658]  It outlaws the exercise of the First Amendment for all city elected representatives, appointed board members, employees, volunteers even, vendors, contractors and anyone else associated with the town in any official capacity to use social networks.
[00:11:07.338 --> 00:11:11.219]  So, you know, yes, we've seen many people come out with controversial statements.
[00:11:11.239 --> 00:11:19.321]  The guy up in Washington, the deputy, he said, we need these MRAPs and these military vehicles to combat the Constitutionalists, the people with all the guns.
[00:11:19.341 --> 00:11:21.161]  We'll talk more about that here in a little bit.
[00:11:21.601 --> 00:11:24.202]  And other controversial statements made all around the country as well.
[00:11:24.282 --> 00:11:32.684]  So I understand why they want to have a somewhat of a policy, but to say that we're just going to pretty much blacklist your free speech because you work for our city.
[00:11:32.704 --> 00:11:34.844]  That's taking it a bridge too far.
[00:11:34.905 --> 00:11:36.885]  This city definitely needs to rethink their policy.
[00:11:37.265 --> 00:11:40.648]  And stop telling their employees, especially the volunteers.
[00:11:40.688 --> 00:11:45.451]  I cannot believe they have volunteers that you cannot use social media without their consent.
[00:11:45.792 --> 00:11:46.892]  Completely ridiculous.
[00:11:47.213 --> 00:11:52.617]  And something else that's completely ridiculous, California and the paramilitary training that's going on out there.
[00:11:53.137 --> 00:11:57.540]  And it says, California Highway Patrol describes itself as a paramilitary organization.
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.903]  And this is a great article by Paul Joseph Watson, but let's hit the bullet points.
[00:12:01.323 --> 00:12:04.345]  Let's take a look at these sections, the screenshots here.
[00:12:04.365 --> 00:12:06.087]  It says, is this job for you?
[00:12:06.787 --> 00:12:12.871]  Are you willing to work in a paramilitary organization operating under structured chain of command?
[00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:14.913]  So that's what they're telling you right there.
[00:12:14.933 --> 00:12:17.174]  You know, this is a paramilitary organization.
[00:12:17.194 --> 00:12:18.615]  You know, do you have all the skills?
[00:12:18.635 --> 00:12:19.476]  Do you have what it takes?
[00:12:19.796 --> 00:12:24.840]  It's not, you know, the blue uniforms and walking around and buying the kids ice cream cones.
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:25.500]  No.
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.141]  Are you ready to do whatever it takes?
[00:12:27.202 --> 00:12:30.584]  Are you ready to use military tactics on people in your own neighborhood?
[00:12:30.604 --> 00:12:31.404]  Let's continue here.
[00:12:32.205 --> 00:12:35.686]  California Highway Patrol is often described as paramilitary department.
[00:12:36.026 --> 00:12:37.046]  They said yes, that's true.
[00:12:37.066 --> 00:12:42.248]  Okay, and also going down it says recruiting America's best to be California's finest.
[00:12:42.888 --> 00:12:49.570]  Former military personnel easily fit into CHP's workforce and adapt well to our paramilitary work environment.
[00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:55.192]  And it says you can use your former military skills to help promote you through the CHP ranks.
[00:12:56.112 --> 00:12:59.215]  And this is what we talk about, these military mindsets.
[00:12:59.735 --> 00:13:01.777]  The shoot first, ask questions later.
[00:13:01.797 --> 00:13:07.102]  You know, if you see one guy shooting from a bus, you light up the entire bus and not try to take out just that one guy.
[00:13:07.403 --> 00:13:08.744]  These are the kind of tactics that we see.
[00:13:09.084 --> 00:13:16.091]  And also California, as well as many other states, have some pretty shady dealings, dealing with their police departments and also their sheriff's departments.
[00:13:16.371 --> 00:13:26.238]  You guys recall not too long ago the Christopher Dorner situation in which they were looking for, you know, a dark-skinned male driving a white truck or something like that.
[00:13:26.618 --> 00:13:30.140]  But regardless, they shot at a blue truck occupied by two white women.
[00:13:30.481 --> 00:13:31.821]  And this is just a complete lunacy.
[00:13:31.841 --> 00:13:34.944]  We were looking for this guy that doesn't look anything like these women.
[00:13:34.964 --> 00:13:37.305]  We're looking for a single guy driving a different colored car.
[00:13:37.325 --> 00:13:39.246]  So let's just shoot whatever car is out here.
[00:13:39.587 --> 00:13:43.249]  And also, Christopher Dorner, let's burn that mother effer down.
[00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:44.230]  You guys recall that?
[00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:56.679]  So, Christopher Dorner is supposedly in the cabin, and he has some hostages, and you can hear the guys on the radio, the police, the sheriffs, whoever they were, saying, get the gas, get the gas, burn the gas, burn that mother-effer down.
[00:13:56.999 --> 00:14:01.682]  And then they come out on mainstream media, and they say, talking to the FBI guy, well, what do you make of this?
[00:14:01.702 --> 00:14:04.184]  What do you make of these claims that this guy made?
[00:14:04.204 --> 00:14:06.546]  He said, well, I'm not exactly sure what context they were talking about.
[00:14:06.986 --> 00:14:09.107]  Now, let's talk about this a little more in depth.
[00:14:09.387 --> 00:14:25.533]  If you and I, viewer, were having a conversation that happens to be recorded by the police, and we say, hey, let's get some gas and burn that mother effer down, and ten minutes later the place is burning to the ground, we're going to be sitting in an interrogation room being asked why we had this conversation, and then the Sheriff's Department comes out,
[00:14:25.973 --> 00:14:28.194]  And they say, you know, what's going on?
[00:14:28.234 --> 00:14:29.134]  This is what the press asks.
[00:14:29.174 --> 00:14:31.815]  And what's going on with these quotes of your officers on the radio?
[00:14:31.835 --> 00:14:38.878]  And the chief or the sheriff, whoever he was, he said, well, a flashbang grenade is commonly referred to as a burner.
[00:14:40.183 --> 00:14:47.166]  Okay, you can call it a rainbow if you want to, but that doesn't explain get the gas, burn the gas, and burn the mother effer down.
[00:14:47.506 --> 00:14:53.568]  And these are the type of paramilitary tactics that very much concern me when we talk about our neighborhood law enforcement.
[00:14:53.808 --> 00:15:01.131]  And that's what we'll be talking about more coming up after this break with Darren McBreen, talking about the shenanigans of the Sheriff's Department in Spokane, Washington.
[00:15:01.531 --> 00:15:01.951]  We're good to go.
[00:15:14.809 --> 00:15:25.275]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock in the last limited shipment of 2014.
[00:15:25.335 --> 00:15:39.965]  The most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process, this ultra clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.

[00:15:44.929 --> 00:15:48.952]  Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to scores of serious problems.
[00:15:49.252 --> 00:15:58.079]  And Secret 12 is a fusion of two organic proprietary forms of Vitamin B12, bringing you a true nutraceutical quality Vitamin B12.
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:15:59.240]  Secret 12.

[00:16:02.082 --> 00:16:02.743]  We're good to go.
[00:16:22.526 --> 00:16:26.311]  There's a reason over 88% of New Year's resolutions fail.
[00:16:26.451 --> 00:16:32.560]  Make this year different by equipping yourself with OxyPowder, the next level in cleansing the body naturally.
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.283]  Using Super Oxygenation OxyPowder.
[00:16:35.584 --> 00:16:37.426]  Available through Infowarslife.com.
[00:16:37.566 --> 00:16:38.728]  Gently cleanses the body.
[00:16:38.908 --> 00:16:40.830]  While you sleep with easy capsules.
[00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:46.834]  Tens of thousands of individuals have used Oxy-Powder to cleanse their bodies and aid in their transformations.
[00:16:47.254 --> 00:16:52.558]  Even InfoWars Nightly News Director Rob Dew has been using Oxy-Powder with incredible success.
[00:16:52.879 --> 00:16:55.220]  Took it that first day, then I took it for six more days after that.
[00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:56.501]  Twelve pounds melted off.
[00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:57.862]  In about a week, I'd say a week.
[00:16:58.023 --> 00:16:58.463]  Seven days.
[00:16:59.023 --> 00:17:00.625]  2015 can be different.
[00:17:00.745 --> 00:17:03.687]  Diet and exercise are important, but a lot of us have already tried that.
[00:17:03.967 --> 00:17:05.769]  Oxy-Powder flushes it out.
[00:17:06.169 --> 00:17:08.911]  Secure your Oxy-Powder at Infowarslife.com.
[00:17:09.172 --> 00:17:11.013]  That's Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:17:20.964 --> 00:17:22.706]  Well, they doubled down, they tripled down.
[00:17:22.966 --> 00:17:28.190]  Now the Spokane, Washington Sheriff's Department is outright refusing to back off the comments that they made last week.
[00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:34.816]  Of course, I'm referring to the deputy who said they need MRAP's military vehicles to go after the Constitutionalists and the gun owners.
[00:17:35.076 --> 00:17:38.039]  They said, hey, these guys are stockpiling weapons and we have to be prepared for that.
[00:17:38.379 --> 00:17:43.543]  Then the Sheriff comes out, he says, hey you guys at Info Wars, you're hate mongers, you're taking this thing out of context.
[00:17:43.923 --> 00:17:53.851]  Even though I don't see how you can take that clip out of context, because you have the lady asking the question, the guy responding to the question, but somehow, according to the Sheriff, that is taking it out of context.
[00:17:54.231 --> 00:18:02.037]  And coming up this weekend, Info Wars, as well as many other Patriots, are going to be out there in Spokane, Washington, to ask the Sheriff's Department what exactly the hell is going on.
[00:18:02.398 --> 00:18:04.900]  And to more on that, we have our reporters in the field.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.581]  We're joined by Darren McBrain on the scene in Spokane Valley.
[00:18:09.042 --> 00:18:10.322]  Darren, tell us what's going on up there.
[00:18:11.363 --> 00:18:12.163]  That's right, Chakari.
[00:18:12.203 --> 00:18:23.008]  We're here in occupied Spokane Valley, Washington, where recently, basically we're investigating comments that were recently made by a Spokane County deputy
[00:18:23.692 --> 00:18:32.501]  Who said, he's basically talking about their recent acquisition of an NRAP, it's a mine-resistant vehicle, used in combat situations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:18:32.762 --> 00:18:41.030]  Well now it's here in the city, and he's saying that it will be utilized to go against constitutionalists and gun owners.
[00:18:41.331 --> 00:18:45.335]  Now a lot of people are very concerned, obviously, about these comments.
[00:18:45.735 --> 00:18:50.598]  But I'm here to tell you that this guy is simply regurgitating what he learned in training.
[00:18:50.959 --> 00:18:57.123]  And get this, Jakari, we recently found out that he got much of his training from the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:18:57.363 --> 00:19:05.048]  That's right, the SPLC is now training, not just here in Spokane, but all across the board, all across the United States.
[00:19:05.108 --> 00:19:07.690]  They are training the nation's police departments.
[00:19:08.032 --> 00:19:11.995]  Yeah, and SPLC, they're the ones who like to say that everybody's a hate group, pretty much.
[00:19:12.035 --> 00:19:14.296]  If you don't follow their narrative, that's what's going on.
[00:19:14.657 --> 00:19:24.463]  And we've previously seen, I believe it was a SWAT commander in the state of Illinois, he said, yes, we need these things for all these returning veterans, these guys, you know, to come back home and make IEDs.
[00:19:24.563 --> 00:19:29.567]  I don't know if there's a rash of IEDs that aren't making the news, but this is the justification for these vehicles.
[00:19:30.626 --> 00:19:31.227]  Well, that's right.
[00:19:31.307 --> 00:19:37.053]  And for those who aren't familiar with the Southern Poverty Law Center, they're a non-profit organization.
[00:19:37.073 --> 00:19:40.036]  A lot of their funding comes from George Soros and the like.
[00:19:40.056 --> 00:19:42.078]  A multi-million dollar organization.
[00:19:42.099 --> 00:19:44.001]  They're growing every year.
[00:19:44.381 --> 00:19:47.705]  And every year they release their annual watch list.
[00:19:47.765 --> 00:19:49.046]  It's a terror watch list.
[00:19:49.106 --> 00:19:51.469]  It's a right-wing extremist list.
[00:19:52.029 --> 00:20:09.871]  And I'm going to read to you some of the people and organizations that have been listed, and this will blow your mind because some of the people that are listed as potential terrorists, as potential right-wing extremists, are Ron Paul, for example, may be, according to them, be a right-wing extremist.
[00:20:10.552 --> 00:20:12.314]  There's also Chuck Baldwin.
[00:20:12.975 --> 00:20:14.016]  There's Alex Jones.
[00:20:14.076 --> 00:20:15.358]  He's public enemy number one.
[00:20:15.418 --> 00:20:20.164]  He's there on their list because of his massive influence with lots of people.
[00:20:20.204 --> 00:20:22.187]  They say he's very, very dangerous.
[00:20:22.747 --> 00:20:28.355]  And they also list, it's basically guilt by association because they do include
[00:20:28.975 --> 00:20:43.520]  Real homegrown right-wing extremists like the KKK, Klansmen, Neo-Nazis, but they mix these guys in with true American patriots and it confuses young people like this guy who just, you know, got on the police department.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:50.763]  He's in training, he's seeing a real threat, but then they put in Ron Paul, constitutionalists like you and I in the mix.
[00:20:51.394 --> 00:20:52.134]  That's exactly right.
[00:20:52.154 --> 00:20:56.217]  Like you said, they have legitimate threats, and then they try to just throw it at anybody else.
[00:20:56.237 --> 00:20:59.599]  You know, okay, so they buy this, so let's just slip in these other few guys.
[00:20:59.899 --> 00:21:04.963]  Now, Darren, I know you guys have a lot of stuff going on out there, so just tell us what's coming up this weekend on the Saturday.
[00:21:05.463 --> 00:21:05.783]  That's right.
[00:21:05.803 --> 00:21:13.988]  Well, we are inviting everybody to come out this Saturday and join us, and it's going to be in Spokane Valley, right there at the police department at 2 o'clock p.m.
[00:21:14.329 --> 00:21:15.609]  We want to open up a dialogue.
[00:21:15.629 --> 00:21:17.891]  We want to communicate with not only the sheriff,
[00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:21.760]  But federal agencies across the board who are attempting
[00:21:22.199 --> 00:21:26.321]  To militarize the police, and attempting, I mean, let's just say they've done it, okay?
[00:21:26.381 --> 00:21:28.562]  We are, this is an occupying force.
[00:21:29.062 --> 00:21:38.506]  The police departments across the board, they behave like an occupying army, and the residents of this county and all across the country, they're getting pretty tired of it.
[00:21:38.886 --> 00:21:45.469]  They don't want to see MRAPs patrolling their neighborhoods, and that is the message that they are sending this Saturday.
[00:21:45.849 --> 00:21:47.550]  No more, and they want that thing out of here.
[00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:49.871]  They want that MRAP to go back to where it came from.
[00:21:50.367 --> 00:21:51.208]  That's exactly right.
[00:21:51.248 --> 00:21:53.029]  Not just there, we see other places as well.
[00:21:53.069 --> 00:21:54.350]  They have them in the St.
[00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:55.090]  Louis, not the St.
[00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.951]  Louis, well they have them in St.
[00:21:55.971 --> 00:21:58.793]  Louis, but I was going to say the San Diego school system.
[00:21:58.953 --> 00:22:01.395]  Many other places as well, they have them at Ohio State.
[00:22:01.415 --> 00:22:05.798]  And a lot of people are asking, why do you guys need those things to just patrol our streets?
[00:22:05.838 --> 00:22:13.204]  And hopefully you guys will get somewhat of an answer this Saturday, but hopefully they will also come to their senses and realize they don't need these things for everyday situations.
[00:22:13.524 --> 00:22:15.325]  Well, Darren McBreen, I'll let you guys get back to work.
[00:22:15.345 --> 00:22:16.086]  Thank you for your time.
[00:22:16.806 --> 00:22:17.627]  All right, Shakari, thank you.
[00:22:18.106 --> 00:22:18.707]  Stay tuned.
[00:22:18.747 --> 00:22:19.668]  This is the Info Wars Nightly News.

[00:22:46.003 --> 00:22:46.803]  Molon Lave.
[00:22:46.963 --> 00:22:48.623]  That's Greek for come and take it.

[00:24:04.509 --> 00:24:06.995]  Yeah, but we the people said no.
[00:24:07.015 --> 00:24:08.538]  Why are they still trying to push this through?
[00:24:08.578 --> 00:24:09.541]  These people aren't elected.
[00:24:09.561 --> 00:24:10.463]  That's unconstitutional.
[00:24:10.483 --> 00:24:11.264]  That's treason, sir.
[00:24:11.625 --> 00:24:12.507]  You understand that?
[00:24:12.768 --> 00:24:14.491]  Agenda 21, that's from the United Nations.
[00:24:14.532 --> 00:24:15.213]  That's what you're trying to push.
[00:24:26.397 --> 00:24:36.279]  Dan Badundi, fame4wars.com, and we're in Providence, Rhode Island, where unelected officials have just taken it upon themselves to push through a draconian bill called Roadmap Rhode Island.
[00:24:36.599 --> 00:24:46.161]  And Roadmap Rhode Island is nothing more than the United Nations Agenda 21, and they did this without the approval of the elected officials or the registered voters.
[00:24:46.181 --> 00:24:56.103]  We have towns and communities that have land that will be impacted, property that will be impacted, and if you put large groups of
[00:24:56.661 --> 00:25:00.862]  Subsidize housing by who, by the way, get their money from the taxpayers.
[00:25:03.263 --> 00:25:07.244]  We are paying for all of this and our children will continue to pay for it.
[00:25:07.564 --> 00:25:13.526]  It feels like we're going to be sodomized for the rest of our lives by big government, big brother.
[00:25:13.686 --> 00:25:18.227]  And if you take money from these people, you're going to be married to them for the rest of your life.
[00:25:24.548 --> 00:25:26.550]  I do not agree with the accusations.
[00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:31.254]  I can understand how people have been misled by things that have been said.
[00:25:55.316 --> 00:25:57.017]  And I think it's very unfortunate.
[00:25:57.037 --> 00:26:03.179]  And I think that the people who have started the misinformation should be held accountable as well.
[00:26:03.799 --> 00:26:07.580]  I will vote in support because I believe it's a good plan.
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.821]  It's just your paycheck.
[00:26:09.281 --> 00:26:09.761]  I get it.
[00:26:10.201 --> 00:26:11.362]  No, it's not my paycheck.
[00:26:11.542 --> 00:26:14.042]  I have zero job security just so they can know.
[00:26:14.403 --> 00:26:16.943]  I will vote for this plan because I think it's a good plan.
[00:26:17.304 --> 00:26:17.984]  It's just a plan.
[00:26:18.024 --> 00:26:19.704]  It doesn't rewrite the Constitution.
[00:26:19.784 --> 00:26:21.145]  It doesn't change the laws.
[00:26:21.758 --> 00:26:28.271]  But it's something that I think will help Rhode Island move in a direction different from the one that you're unhappy with right now.
[00:26:28.291 --> 00:26:29.654]  Thank you.
[00:26:38.676 --> 00:26:40.716]  We help the communities with HUD money.
[00:26:41.217 --> 00:26:45.737]  But doesn't this money come with strings attached to it?
[00:26:46.818 --> 00:26:47.718]  Strings attached?
[00:26:47.958 --> 00:26:51.959]  As in what kind of development is subsidized or supported?
[00:26:51.979 --> 00:26:53.519]  Well, it was all local grown.
[00:26:54.019 --> 00:26:58.200]  When we went to East Natick or to Connecticut, those communities weren't that
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.782]  We're eligible for CDGB money.
[00:27:00.862 --> 00:27:03.243]  It was the neighbors that came and said, we want a sidewalk.
[00:27:03.504 --> 00:27:04.504]  We want better drainage.
[00:27:04.665 --> 00:27:05.385]  And that's what we did.
[00:27:05.465 --> 00:27:16.934]  But this plan, in order to access some... Oakland Beach, East David... With Roadmap RI, will this plan require that communities adhere to HUD standards in order to take some of that money?
[00:27:16.954 --> 00:27:17.935]  Well, there's some standards.
[00:27:18.135 --> 00:27:19.576]  I mean, you can't waste the money.
[00:27:19.836 --> 00:27:24.379]  It has to be spent according to WISE parameters.
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.101]  There's some good government standards.
[00:27:29.121 --> 00:27:29.401]  No, no, no.
[00:27:29.421 --> 00:27:31.522]  The courts have ruled on behalf of property taxpayers over and over again.
[00:27:31.542 --> 00:27:32.062]  On private property.
[00:27:32.102 --> 00:27:32.642]  Over and over again.
[00:27:32.682 --> 00:27:32.902]  I know.
[00:27:32.922 --> 00:27:34.963]  I've dealt with zoning at the local level for many, many years.
[00:27:48.186 --> 00:27:52.487]  Private property issues in the courts are very strong on protecting private property as they continue.
[00:27:52.587 --> 00:27:53.068]  Will continue to be.
[00:27:53.088 --> 00:27:56.549]  Are you saying that story about the handicapped ramp at the lady's house?
[00:27:56.569 --> 00:27:58.389]  I don't know yet, I don't know.
[00:27:58.469 --> 00:28:00.450]  The bike ramp went right in front of somebody's house.
[00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:08.292]  I suppose there's some... I don't want to refute I think it's Mr. Stenhouse's story, but it seemed not common to what I've heard.
[00:28:11.233 --> 00:28:13.355]  Are you surprised at the vocal opposition today?
[00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:40.396]  Yes, because we've worked so hard to have public input over the last 18 months.
[00:28:40.876 --> 00:28:42.037]  A lot of outreach.
[00:28:42.738 --> 00:28:43.939]  As you heard, some testimony.
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:48.804]  I heard about it, I came out, I participated, I was welcomed immediately into the dialogue.
[00:28:49.665 --> 00:28:53.209]  So, of course, they're here today, and that's good.
[00:28:53.829 --> 00:28:55.711]  Expressing their opinion, so on we go.
[00:28:56.051 --> 00:28:57.873]  Governor, why do you think people are against this plan?
[00:28:58.313 --> 00:28:59.635]  There's some against it and some for it.
[00:29:00.015 --> 00:29:04.279]  I was very happy to hear those that are expressing their opinions.
[00:29:04.319 --> 00:29:05.280]  We're a lot in favor.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.402]  I'm sure if you were here, you heard those also.
[00:29:07.502 --> 00:29:09.404]  Is this not a violation of the Constitution, sir?
[00:29:09.544 --> 00:29:10.224]  In the domain?
[00:29:10.264 --> 00:29:11.125]  Yes, it is, sir.
[00:29:11.245 --> 00:29:11.926]  It's treason.
[00:29:12.827 --> 00:29:14.488]  Then there'd be lawyers taking us to court.
[00:29:14.748 --> 00:29:15.689]  No, this is treason, sir.
[00:29:15.709 --> 00:29:17.471]  This is Agenda 21 by the United Nations.
[00:29:17.491 --> 00:29:18.172]  We are onto this.
[00:29:19.856 --> 00:29:20.877]  That's high treason, sir.
[00:29:22.558 --> 00:29:26.300]  That's the Governor of Rhode Island, folks.
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:30.282]  These people here are supporting high treason against the Constitution of the United States.
[00:29:31.262 --> 00:29:32.943]  Private property rights are trying to distinct.
[00:29:39.025 --> 00:29:41.866]  We the people, Governor, not we the officials.
[00:29:41.886 --> 00:29:46.446]  We the people.
[00:29:46.846 --> 00:29:48.107]  The Constitution comes first.
[00:29:48.167 --> 00:29:50.667]  We will not comply with the rule of Macquarie Island.
[00:29:50.807 --> 00:29:54.088]  How are you an investigative reporter and challenging him about we the people?
[00:29:54.908 --> 00:29:56.948]  Because this is pure unconstitutional, ma'am.
[00:29:56.988 --> 00:29:58.329]  What's unconstitutional about it?
[00:29:58.349 --> 00:29:59.029]  Eminent don't name.
[00:29:59.229 --> 00:29:59.929]  I mean, do you not know?
[00:29:59.949 --> 00:30:03.130]  There's nothing in the plan that talks about Eminent don't name.
[00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:05.030]  There's a lot in the plan that talks about that.
[00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:07.071]  That's a good thing.
[00:30:07.191 --> 00:30:11.894]  So I plan to vote in favor of the plan.
[00:30:12.435 --> 00:30:17.238]  So with that, I'll take a motion to approve the plan.
[00:30:17.258 --> 00:30:20.000]  Mr. Flores, Mervyn, you have a motion?
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:26.864]  Mr. Chairman, I make a motion to adopt the state of Rhode Island draft roadmap, Rhode Island economic development plan.
[00:30:27.184 --> 00:30:28.225]  That's moving to the future.
[00:30:29.133 --> 00:30:30.234]  Motion's been made.
[00:30:30.354 --> 00:30:31.815]  Is there a second on the motion?
[00:30:31.835 --> 00:30:35.016]  Director Lewis seconds the motion to approve the plan.
[00:30:35.116 --> 00:30:38.038]  Is there any further discussion from the Council at this time?
[00:30:39.359 --> 00:30:41.020]  Hearing none, I will call the roll.
[00:30:42.532 --> 00:30:45.974]  And Rhode Island has just witnessed today the birth of Agenda 21.
[00:30:46.795 --> 00:30:54.360]  Agenda 21 is the action plan to destroy your sovereignty, and that is your personal sovereignty and your national sovereignty.
[00:30:54.721 --> 00:31:03.327]  This is the green mask, the environmental mask, because if you are terrified that you're killing the planet, you will be willing to accept any restriction.
[00:31:03.707 --> 00:31:04.627]  Hold on, you understand?
[00:31:04.647 --> 00:31:08.030]  We are not going to comply by rule of law.
[00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:09.231]  We will not comply.
[00:31:09.331 --> 00:31:09.531]  Until 1776.
[00:31:09.571 --> 00:31:10.932]  This man is really an activist.
[00:31:11.232 --> 00:31:13.533]  No, I'm just doing my job.
[00:31:29.943 --> 00:31:33.086]  We don't trust the government.
[00:31:33.126 --> 00:31:33.726]  We're tired.
[00:31:33.786 --> 00:31:39.351]  I tell you what, you're not representing all of the voters in your area.
[00:31:39.391 --> 00:31:45.737]  Because I tell you what, when you get up and you say you represent the people in Southeast Iowa, you don't get a gift.
[00:31:54.404 --> 00:31:57.667]  When the pensions of the old people... I'm 77, my brother is 73.
[00:31:57.707 --> 00:32:01.271]  When you go in, and because of a puddle, Hudson wants to come in.
[00:32:01.351 --> 00:32:04.193]  A puddle, or standing water for 40 days, or a pond.
[00:32:04.213 --> 00:32:05.014]  They need that pond.
[00:32:05.094 --> 00:32:06.596]  You've got a lot to learn.
[00:32:06.676 --> 00:32:10.559]  And I tell you what, I'm gonna be there to teach you.
[00:32:17.646 --> 00:32:21.269]  My book, Behind the Green Mask, is a great way to educate yourself.
[00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:23.991]  You want to give this information to your legislators.
[00:32:24.271 --> 00:32:26.393]  Let them know about this if they don't know.
[00:32:26.693 --> 00:32:34.139]  And if they aren't willing to refuse to go along with the federal grants, with the plans, with the projects, then take them out.
[00:32:34.499 --> 00:32:35.660]  Remove them from office.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.981]  And do this locally.
[00:32:43.848 --> 00:32:50.237]  Were you thinking the elf on a shelf was just a playful way to get your kids to behave in the days leading up to Christmas?
[00:32:50.597 --> 00:32:51.638]  Well, think again.
[00:32:51.959 --> 00:32:57.646]  According to a digital tech professor, you're actually conditioning your kids to accept the surveillance state.
[00:32:58.227 --> 00:32:58.648]  Think about it.
[00:32:58.968 --> 00:33:10.499]  He's always watching your kids, he reports back to a higher authority, he'll dole out goodies if they behave, and if not, their name goes on the no-fly, er, the naughty list.
[00:33:10.859 --> 00:33:16.184]  Are you teaching your kids that you're the boss, or some unseen authority is the boss?
[00:33:16.644 --> 00:33:28.867]  In her recently published paper titled, Who's the Boss?, Laura Pinto says the idea of the doll reporting back to Santa each night sets up children for dangerous, uncritical acceptance of power structures.
[00:33:29.407 --> 00:33:34.909]  It teaches kids that it's okay to be spied on and you shouldn't have any expectation of privacy.
[00:33:35.549 --> 00:33:43.954]  Now, considering the fact that children have been told for years that Santa's making a list and checking it twice, Pinto's probably just being paranoid.
[00:33:44.334 --> 00:33:48.316]  But this kind of conditioning behavior isn't unique to the elf on the shelf.
[00:33:48.536 --> 00:33:53.519]  We've seen blatant conditioning like this in cartoons like Disney's Shutterbug Time.
[00:33:53.979 --> 00:33:58.902]  Camera-equipped ladybugs spy on kids and then report back to a central authority.
[00:33:59.702 --> 00:34:09.410]  This introduction to the new totalitarian society is benign, though, because the snooper is just a cute little ladybug who only spies because she loves you.
[00:34:09.711 --> 00:34:17.417]  This is, of course, predictive programming to get your children to accept the coming drone surveillance state, which we warned you about in 2007.
[00:34:17.557 --> 00:34:27.485]  DARPA researchers were working on injecting computer chips into moth pupa and then hatching them into sophisticated cyborg moths, literal shutterbugs.
[00:34:28.326 --> 00:34:40.752]  Now, if you aren't aware, predictive programming is a technique that's based on planting ideas and concepts in the brains of viewers so that they'll seem normal and more easily accepted when they actually happen.
[00:34:41.012 --> 00:34:45.374]  The Vigilant Citizen took an in-depth look at iconic 80s cartoon G.I.
[00:34:45.434 --> 00:34:48.936]  Joe and found a strange case of predictive programming.
[00:34:49.456 --> 00:34:50.276]  In the first G.I.
[00:34:50.316 --> 00:34:53.578]  Joe episode ever aired, titled Pyramid of Darkness,
[00:34:54.218 --> 00:34:59.641]  Cobra seeks to take control of the world by shutting down the power grid of the Northern Hemisphere.
[00:35:00.042 --> 00:35:11.729]  Other episode plots include the replacement of the US dollar, confiscating citizens' gold, and the usage of mind control on civilians and MKUltra in the entertainment business.
[00:35:12.329 --> 00:35:13.390]  Cobra is real!
[00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:15.271]  You can call it whatever you want!
[00:35:16.587 --> 00:35:18.488]  Cobra is in control of America!
[00:35:18.988 --> 00:35:22.971]  I am Supreme Cobra Commander!
[00:35:23.631 --> 00:35:28.434]  You call your petty bureaucrats officials and authorities?
[00:35:28.954 --> 00:35:35.158]  You will kneel before Cobra or face my wrath!
[00:35:35.178 --> 00:35:38.660]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.961]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:35:51.613 --> 00:35:52.895]  Well, that's it for our show tonight.

[00:36:11.212 --> 00:36:16.999]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:27.172]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:36:27.492 --> 00:36:31.255]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:36:31.796 --> 00:36:36.479]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:43.085]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:36:43.405 --> 00:36:45.687]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
