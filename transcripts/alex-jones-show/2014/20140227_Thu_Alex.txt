[00:00:01.631 --> 00:00:02.793]  Coast to coast.
[00:00:03.174 --> 00:00:04.516]  Direct from Austin.
[00:00:05.237 --> 00:00:08.441]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:14.898 --> 00:00:15.519]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.221]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.962 --> 00:00:19.063]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.724 --> 00:00:20.525]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.326 --> 00:00:22.207]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.847 --> 00:00:26.472]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.052 --> 00:00:31.117]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:37.897]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:38.858 --> 00:00:42.660]  I'm David Knight and it's Thursday, February 27th, 2014.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.142]  I'll be filling in for Alex today, but we have an amazing show.
[00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:51.106]  We've got some breaking investigative report coming up in the second hour.
[00:00:51.706 --> 00:00:52.867]  You're not going to want to miss this.
[00:00:52.887 --> 00:00:58.271]  You know, we've got even Rachel Maddow and CNN asking questions about the Boston bombing now.
[00:00:59.107 --> 00:00:59.787]  Can you imagine that?
[00:01:00.488 --> 00:01:01.869]  That's pretty much a change, isn't it?
[00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:03.990]  Things have changed a lot in the last year.
[00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:14.536]  They've gone from mocking Alex to asking questions about a suspect, Ibrahim Todeshev, who's picked up by the FBI for questioning, tells everybody they're going to kill me.
[00:01:14.556 --> 00:01:17.958]  He gets shot six times, I believe it was, once in the back of the head.
[00:01:18.218 --> 00:01:20.539]  I mean, we need to look into this.
[00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:24.862]  There's a lot of questions about both the Boston bombing and Sandy Hook.
[00:01:25.382 --> 00:01:26.604]  About how the government used it?
[00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:30.531]  About assassination of a witness in the case of the Boston bombing?
[00:01:31.576 --> 00:01:33.277]  A lot, a lot of issues.
[00:01:33.317 --> 00:01:37.361]  Now, we've got today, coming up in the second hour, Wolfgang Halbig.
[00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:43.886]  Now, Wolfgang Halbig is a former state trooper, he's a former educator, and he's a school safety consultant.
[00:01:44.326 --> 00:01:46.208]  He's not an investigative reporter.
[00:01:46.228 --> 00:01:50.911]  You know, usually we see these kind of details come out years, maybe decades after the event.
[00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:54.734]  There was an excellent, excellent documentary on the Oklahoma City bombing.
[00:01:55.095 --> 00:01:57.396]  We carry that here at InfoWars.
[00:01:58.686 --> 00:02:04.091]  A lot of times, it takes a very long time for these investigations to be put together by investigative journalists.
[00:02:04.811 --> 00:02:09.956]  This guy, Wolfgang Halbig, as I said, has both experience in law enforcement and education.
[00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:11.477]  He is a school safety consultant.
[00:02:11.557 --> 00:02:24.868]  And so, when the Sandy Hook shooting happened, he investigated it, just as he investigated Columbine and other school shootings to find out what went wrong, what could be changed, how could he advise schools to keep that from happening.
[00:02:25.717 --> 00:02:33.039]  And what he found was amazing, and you're going to want to hear this when he comes in, the detail that he has about what happened at Sandy Hook.
[00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.279]  It makes you question the entire narrative.
[00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:36.640]  And we've questioned it from the very beginning.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.661]  I remember I had just been here a couple of months when it happened, and everything changed.
[00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:47.263]  I mean, Alex doubled down on this like I've never seen before or since.
[00:02:47.723 --> 00:02:48.543]  He knew it was on.
[00:02:48.603 --> 00:02:52.064]  He knew this was a false flag set up to take our gun rights away.
[00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:56.588]  And they have been pretty successful in some of the northeastern areas.
[00:02:56.608 --> 00:02:58.630]  We've got the SAFE Act got passed in New York.
[00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.512]  We see what's going on in Connecticut.
[00:03:00.552 --> 00:03:07.178]  They're now said we're going to register firearms and then they're confiscating them right away from people who haven't turned them in.
[00:03:07.218 --> 00:03:10.021]  And we saw that amazing letter that Alex talked about yesterday.
[00:03:10.922 --> 00:03:20.968]  It was written on the 2nd of January and said, we didn't receive your application, your registration by the 1st of January, so now you have the option of proving to us that you've destroyed them or we're going to come get them or you can turn them in.
[00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:23.050]  It's just amazing.
[00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.712]  As we've always said, registration is a prelude to confiscation.
[00:03:27.272 --> 00:03:33.637]  What's going on in Connecticut with these gun rules as well as Sandy Hook and the subsequent investigation?
[00:03:34.457 --> 00:03:38.878]  When he tried to find out about this, Wolfgang Halbig wasn't just stonewalled.
[00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:43.940]  They didn't just ignore his legal request, Freedom of Information Act request.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:58.684]  They actually threatened him on the phone and got police officers in Florida where he lives to visit his house twice to tell him to stop investigating, stop filing these things, or they were going to put criminal charges on him for asking information.
[00:03:59.265 --> 00:04:01.045]  That's absolutely amazing.
[00:04:01.325 --> 00:04:03.146]  And we're also going to be joined in this hour
[00:04:03.706 --> 00:04:07.309]  With Paul Joseph Watson, he's going to be talking about what's going on in the Ukraine.
[00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:09.331]  We've got developments there with the IMF.
[00:04:09.811 --> 00:04:11.432]  They're now making their move.
[00:04:11.472 --> 00:04:18.658]  They can smell the opportunity to get in and control that country, just like blood and the water.
[00:04:18.718 --> 00:04:21.060]  So we're going to be talking to Paul Joseph Watson about that.
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:32.668]  about the tensions that are being manufactured by Washington between the US and Russia and we're also going to be talking in the third hour to Jakari Jackson and Leanne McAdoo.
[00:04:32.688 --> 00:04:33.849]  They'll be joining us in the studio.
[00:04:35.267 --> 00:04:44.791]  Now we've had some interesting news here in the last couple of days about what's going on in Arizona and religious freedom.
[00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:47.912]  And we've got a take on that right after we come back from break.
[00:04:48.412 --> 00:04:49.512]  It's going to be a little bit different.
[00:04:49.532 --> 00:04:54.634]  I've actually looked at the bill and it's not exactly the way it's been portrayed in the media.
[00:04:54.734 --> 00:04:56.455]  Not at all the way it's been portrayed in the media.
[00:04:56.475 --> 00:04:58.676]  We're going to talk about that and some other stories.
[00:04:59.016 --> 00:05:02.197]  We've got a hundred sailors now sick from Fukushima.
[00:05:02.237 --> 00:05:03.158]  The number is increasing.
[00:05:03.178 --> 00:05:03.838]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:10.017 --> 00:05:12.599]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.724]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:25.872]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:05:26.112 --> 00:05:30.436]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:05:30.636 --> 00:05:34.440]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.303]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:05:40.544 --> 00:05:43.325]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:05:43.705 --> 00:05:48.928]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[00:06:09.585 --> 00:06:12.930]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.273]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:06:15.433 --> 00:06:20.640]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.722]  There are other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:06:24.022 --> 00:06:34.290]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:47.980]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency, super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:54.487]  Supermail Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[00:07:09.682 --> 00:07:15.284]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:07:15.484 --> 00:07:22.686]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:07:22.866 --> 00:07:26.027]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:07:26.207 --> 00:07:28.008]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:07:28.248 --> 00:07:32.810]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.651]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:07:35.812 --> 00:07:41.594]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:07:41.774 --> 00:07:45.236]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[00:07:45.436 --> 00:07:50.498]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:53.660]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:59.785]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[00:07:59.885 --> 00:08:01.887]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.

[00:08:34.484 --> 00:08:35.406]  Thomas Jefferson
[00:08:38.135 --> 00:08:47.221]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:48.142 --> 00:08:49.403]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:49.463 --> 00:08:52.745]  I'm David Knight filling in for Alex today on this Thursday, February 27th, 2014.
[00:08:53.326 --> 00:08:58.429]  Hard to believe that we've already had two months of the new year go by.
[00:08:58.469 --> 00:08:59.690]  It's going very, very quickly.
[00:09:00.191 --> 00:09:01.511]  Now yesterday we had
[00:09:02.512 --> 00:09:05.555]  A lot of news about the battle for religious freedom.
[00:09:05.895 --> 00:09:15.565]  Everybody was waiting to see what the governor of Arizona was going to do about this bill that had been passed in the legislature in Arizona entitled relating to the free exercise of religion.
[00:09:16.937 --> 00:09:22.282]  And I was very interested to see what this was all about, so I actually got the bill and looked at it.
[00:09:22.522 --> 00:09:28.767]  And you know, when I googled the terms, when I searched the terms sex, that's not anywhere in there.
[00:09:29.368 --> 00:09:32.630]  The term gay, the term homosexual is not in there anywhere.
[00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:34.372]  It's all about religious freedom.
[00:09:35.253 --> 00:09:37.455]  And it's about whether or not we're going to allow
[00:09:38.695 --> 00:09:41.416]  Private companies to be dictated to by government.
[00:09:41.456 --> 00:09:43.297]  But we've already had that discussion, haven't we?
[00:09:43.857 --> 00:09:53.101]  And when we see that Hobby Lobby can be fined a million dollars a day because they don't want to provide abortion, which they see as murder.
[00:09:53.321 --> 00:09:55.662]  They don't want to provide that coverage to their employees.
[00:09:56.163 --> 00:09:58.604]  But the Obama administration says, nope, we don't care.
[00:09:58.664 --> 00:10:00.265]  We're going to mandate that to you.
[00:10:00.305 --> 00:10:06.087]  I mean, certainly there's issues with just the idea that they're mandating coverage, that we ought to stop at that point.
[00:10:06.107 --> 00:10:07.488]  But then they go one step further.
[00:10:08.294 --> 00:10:12.255]  And they violate the clear prohibitions against the free exercise of religion.
[00:10:13.135 --> 00:10:20.598]  Let's understand that the free exercise of religion, protected in the First Amendment, is not granted by the First Amendment.
[00:10:21.158 --> 00:10:32.341]  It is actually there to show us that the government is going to respect those fundamental rights that we have for free speech, for freedom of religion, for the right to protect ourselves, for the right to
[00:10:33.101 --> 00:10:34.442]  Keep government at bay.
[00:10:34.482 --> 00:10:35.743]  These are negative rights.
[00:10:35.803 --> 00:10:36.943]  These are not positive rights.
[00:10:36.963 --> 00:10:41.346]  These are things that says, government, you cannot step on these rights that we already have.
[00:10:41.386 --> 00:10:42.947]  These are not being granted by the government.
[00:10:42.967 --> 00:10:44.568]  They're just being recognized by the government.
[00:10:45.148 --> 00:10:48.851]  So it's important when we see how the government reacts to these things.
[00:10:49.551 --> 00:10:55.793]  It tells us, not whether or not we have those rights, it tells us whether or not the government is going to act as a tyrant.
[00:10:56.173 --> 00:10:59.174]  And we're seeing this over and over again, how they're going to act.
[00:10:59.895 --> 00:11:14.820]  So it's kind of interesting to look at this bill, and one of the things that I came across as I'm looking through this, it says that the state action may subsequently burden a person's exercise of religion only if the government or non-governmental person
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.646]  Is both in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest... Wait a minute!
[00:11:21.127 --> 00:11:21.727]  Stop right there!
[00:11:22.188 --> 00:11:27.474]  You mean you can substantially burden a person's exercise of religion if...
[00:11:29.085 --> 00:11:32.109]  It's in furtherance of a compelling government interest?
[00:11:32.849 --> 00:11:33.510]  Are you serious?
[00:11:34.291 --> 00:11:36.233]  That's not what the First Amendment is about.
[00:11:36.954 --> 00:11:40.959]  And to say that this is a bill for the free exercise of religion is not true.
[00:11:41.019 --> 00:11:44.363]  This is simply a head fake for their base.
[00:11:44.863 --> 00:11:48.207]  They know that their base is seeing religious freedom trampled everywhere.
[00:11:49.128 --> 00:11:52.391]  So they want to do something to shore up that base.
[00:11:52.651 --> 00:11:56.854]  That is, if you read the actual bill, it was really very meaningless.
[00:11:57.555 --> 00:12:00.277]  But that was not the way that it came down.
[00:12:00.838 --> 00:12:10.145]  It was such an outrage that all the Republican leadership, McCain in Arizona, as well as even Romney, came out and opposed this bill.
[00:12:10.185 --> 00:12:12.547]  And of course the Republican governor vetoed this bill.
[00:12:13.553 --> 00:12:14.233]  Because you know what?
[00:12:14.614 --> 00:12:25.880]  This fundamentally is about religion, but there's a religion that's far more important today in America, and that's the religion of bowing down before the homosexual community.
[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:36.986]  They're the ones who are setting the agenda, they're the ones that you have to please, and if they think that this is something that is going to impinge on their rights, then you've got to back off.
[00:12:37.346 --> 00:12:38.407]  Because even
[00:12:39.597 --> 00:12:44.983]  Making points with your base as the Republicans are simply trying to do with this meaningless bill.
[00:12:45.583 --> 00:12:49.127]  Even that has to back off if you're going to offend the homosexual community today.
[00:12:49.547 --> 00:12:51.549]  And we saw some other interesting things here too.
[00:12:51.609 --> 00:12:55.914]  We saw the NFL putting pressure on Arizona saying if you pass a bill
[00:12:57.145 --> 00:13:02.628]  That is a weak restatement of religious liberty, then we're going to pull the Super Bowl away.
[00:13:03.008 --> 00:13:12.894]  So you see again, the NFL is always there pushing the social agenda of the government, pushing the control of the government, pushing an anti-family agenda.
[00:13:12.914 --> 00:13:15.256]  You know, they would not allow a very
[00:13:16.217 --> 00:13:27.369]  Uh, very innocuous Super Bowl commercial that showed a man, uh, kind of a morning in America type of commercial, a man coming home to his family, protecting his family.
[00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:28.851]  They would not show that.
[00:13:29.352 --> 00:13:34.017]  They would not show a man exercising the fatherly protection of his family.
[00:13:34.818 --> 00:13:35.980]  There wasn't any guns in it.
[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.241]  They weren't shooting things.
[00:13:37.402 --> 00:13:38.724]  It was just that.
[00:13:38.764 --> 00:13:43.290]  It was kind of a pastoral type of suburban pastoral scene where he comes home.
[00:13:43.931 --> 00:13:44.912]  The NFL pulled that.
[00:13:45.573 --> 00:13:49.378]  And it brings up the question of what does it mean for tolerance?
[00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:51.401]  Now the Washington Examiner
[00:13:52.483 --> 00:14:05.050]  He quoted this and said, our policies emphasize tolerance, inclusiveness, and prohibit discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other improper standard.
[00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:06.831]  Are they really that tolerant of religion?
[00:14:07.071 --> 00:14:08.552]  That was what the NFL said.
[00:14:09.232 --> 00:14:16.416]  I looked up the word tolerance, and it says that you're going to show willingness to allow the existence of opinions or behavior that one doesn't agree with.
[00:14:16.996 --> 00:14:18.277]  But that's not what they want.
[00:14:19.278 --> 00:14:23.081]  They want you to celebrate, to subsidize their relation.
[00:14:23.521 --> 00:14:31.006]  And that's why I have a problem with a lot of libertarians like Gary Johnson, who will come in and make gay marriage one of their main issues.
[00:14:31.286 --> 00:14:40.812]  It really is an infringement on the rights and the liberties of other people to say, if you're going to tolerate the behavior, that means that you're not going to make it a criminal action.
[00:14:40.832 --> 00:14:42.794]  You're not going to intrude in people's lives.
[00:14:43.194 --> 00:14:48.738]  But it also doesn't mean that you have to accept it, that you have to celebrate it, that you have to subsidize it.
[00:14:49.378 --> 00:15:09.290]  I remember the first time I heard about gay marriage, and that was when I was traveling with Andre Maru, who was a Libertarian candidate at the time, and we got that question at a press conference, and he said, the only reason you're looking for this is because you want to force a private company to give you benefits that you are not willing to negotiate with, in a voluntary way.
[00:15:10.031 --> 00:15:13.474]  And he said, and you're also trying to force the taxpayer to get the government to do that.
[00:15:13.894 --> 00:15:19.939]  And you're trying to force people to accept something that they fundamentally don't agree with.
[00:15:19.999 --> 00:15:21.120]  That's not tolerance.
[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.441]  That's servitude.
[00:15:23.142 --> 00:15:28.486]  And it was interesting to see that Tucker Carlson, who is going to be on the show tomorrow, he's going to be in studio.
[00:15:28.566 --> 00:15:35.732]  He's the editor of The Daily Caller and longtime correspondent, commentator on network television.
[00:15:35.772 --> 00:15:37.553]  He's going to be in studio tomorrow with Alex Jones.
[00:15:38.374 --> 00:15:50.942]  And he was raked over the coals when he gave the example of somebody being forced to make a wedding cake or take wedding pictures of a homosexual wedding that they didn't want to take pictures of and being sued by that.
[00:15:51.603 --> 00:15:55.005]  And it's amazing when you look at a situation like this.
[00:15:55.045 --> 00:15:58.027]  This is what the respondent said to that.
[00:15:58.087 --> 00:16:00.248]  The other side of the argument came from
[00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:06.834]  The anchor in this program, McCollum, and she said, well, you're either open for business or you're not open for business.
[00:16:06.855 --> 00:16:09.077]  You can't choose based on different criteria.
[00:16:09.117 --> 00:16:17.064]  You know, I remember a time in America when people had signs up, and I think a lot of places still do, we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone we want.
[00:16:17.867 --> 00:16:21.050]  I don't know why they would do that because they're in it to make money.
[00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:28.836]  I remember when I was a young child, they had one business, a convenience store, would not allow junior high school students in their store.
[00:16:29.256 --> 00:16:31.198]  And even after I got older, I never went back.
[00:16:31.538 --> 00:16:37.202]  I don't know why a businessman would do that, but if they want to make that decision, that's their choice.
[00:16:37.283 --> 00:16:38.463]  And Tucker Carlson said,
[00:16:39.696 --> 00:16:40.716]  It's called tolerance.
[00:16:40.796 --> 00:16:47.638]  When you try to force me to bake a cake for your gay wedding and threaten me with prison if I don't make it, that's called fascism.
[00:16:48.399 --> 00:16:49.879]  It really is fascism.
[00:16:50.039 --> 00:16:52.460]  You know, fascism isn't just extreme nationalism.
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.161]  Fascism has an economic component to it.
[00:16:55.421 --> 00:16:58.902]  That means that tentatively you have private property,
[00:16:59.642 --> 00:17:01.723]  But really, you don't have control over that.
[00:17:01.783 --> 00:17:03.163]  The government has control over it.
[00:17:03.483 --> 00:17:10.405]  That's why we're really going into fascism in this country, where the government dictates everything that you can do.
[00:17:10.765 --> 00:17:13.366]  You don't really have any private property.
[00:17:13.986 --> 00:17:18.627]  Now, we also got coming up in this program on the second hour, we've got Wolfgang Halbig.
[00:17:19.167 --> 00:17:21.989]  And he's going to be talking to us about his Sandy Hook investigation.
[00:17:22.689 --> 00:17:37.238]  It's amazing to see that the mainstream media is now starting to question the Boston bombing narrative, and question the fact that you had the FBI pick up a witness to the Boston bombing, somebody that they said they were going to take in for questioning.
[00:17:37.258 --> 00:17:38.659]  He told his friends, they're going to kill me.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.461]  And in fact, he wound up being shot multiple times, once in the back of the head.
[00:17:42.802 --> 00:17:46.064]  You've got even Rachel Maddow talking about this now.
[00:17:46.644 --> 00:17:47.125]  Pretty amazing.
[00:17:47.145 --> 00:17:51.252]  Maybe she sees the handwriting on the wall as Piers Morgan bit the dust.
[00:17:51.732 --> 00:17:54.297]  But she really hit this and it's better late than never.
[00:17:54.337 --> 00:17:58.243]  Let's listen to some of the things that she said on the MSNBC show that she has.
[00:17:58.263 --> 00:18:01.208]  You guys got that clip?
[00:18:02.816 --> 00:18:09.038]  In January, FBI Director James Comey announced that the Bureau had completed its shooting review in this man's death.
[00:18:09.899 --> 00:18:13.920]  He was shot while being questioned by the FBI and other law enforcement authorities back in May.
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:18.642]  I'm going to show you a couple of photos, which I should warn you are a little bit graphic and might be disturbing.
[00:18:19.902 --> 00:18:28.686]  But from these photos that were taken of that young man's body in the morgue, it appears that he was shot seven times, including once in the top of the head.
[00:18:29.807 --> 00:18:35.371]  Law enforcement officials have said that the man was himself unarmed when the FBI shot and killed him.
[00:18:36.332 --> 00:18:43.237]  And although the FBI's report on this man's shooting is reportedly ready to go, according to James Comey, he says the report on that shooting has been completed.
[00:18:43.577 --> 00:18:44.858]  It still has not been released.
[00:18:45.338 --> 00:18:52.223]  The FBI even blocked the county medical examiner from releasing the autopsy report in this case, even though it was completed and ready to go.
[00:18:53.467 --> 00:18:55.788]  And again, these images are graphic, I'll warn you again.
[00:18:56.528 --> 00:19:06.630]  But the reason we have to count the bullet holes ourselves, looking at these photographs, in order to try to figure out what happened here, is because the FBI won't let that autopsy report be released.
[00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:08.011]  The county's happy to release it.
[00:19:08.051 --> 00:19:10.031]  The FBI is stopping them from doing so.
[00:19:10.911 --> 00:19:21.174]  The reason we have those photographs taken in the morgue is because a friend of the dead man took those photos himself when he went to identify the body, and then he brought the photos to the dead man's father.
[00:19:21.934 --> 00:19:29.285]  And it was the dead man's father who then released the photographs publicly, demanding answers about why the FBI had shot and killed his son.
[00:19:29.426 --> 00:19:34.754]  Why he had to get shot, apparently, seven times, including the top of the head, when he himself was unarmed.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.863]  And that is where the story goes from sort of weird and worrying to intensely weird and worrying.
[00:19:41.243 --> 00:19:46.326]  Because the man who was killed by the FBI in this condo in Orlando, Florida, he was an immigrant from Russia.
[00:19:46.366 --> 00:19:47.887]  He was living here legally.
[00:19:48.428 --> 00:19:49.648]  But his family is still in Russia.
[00:19:49.668 --> 00:19:51.910]  And when he died, his family held his funeral in Russia.
[00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:59.795]  And the friend who had identified his body in the morgue and who took those photos in the morgue to give to the man's father, he attended the funeral in Russia.
[00:19:59.835 --> 00:20:00.696]  He left the U.S.
[00:20:00.736 --> 00:20:01.957]  to go to the funeral in Russia.
[00:20:02.537 --> 00:20:04.839]  Even though that man has a green card and lives here in the U.S.
[00:20:04.999 --> 00:20:09.182]  legally and is legally allowed to travel in and out of the United States, after that funeral, he was never released.
[00:20:10.282 --> 00:20:13.683]  A lot of people's lives and bodies are out of balance.

[00:21:19.039 --> 00:21:20.760]  Burglars call it smash and grab.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.401]  Police call it robbery.
[00:21:23.301 --> 00:21:24.722]  We call it avoidable.

[00:23:09.085 --> 00:23:11.646]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:23:11.906 --> 00:23:16.788]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at My Patriot Supply.
[00:23:17.048 --> 00:23:24.851]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:23:25.151 --> 00:23:29.472]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[00:23:29.672 --> 00:23:33.514]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:23:33.654 --> 00:23:39.355]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:23:39.595 --> 00:23:42.376]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:23:42.756 --> 00:23:47.918]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[00:24:26.783 --> 00:24:28.204]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:28.244 --> 00:24:29.726]  I'm David Knight filling in for Alex.
[00:24:30.246 --> 00:24:33.689]  We're going to be joined in just a few minutes by Paul Joseph Watson from London.
[00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:36.392]  He's going to be talking to us about what's going on in the Ukraine.
[00:24:36.912 --> 00:24:39.195]  We see the IMF smells the problems.
[00:24:39.235 --> 00:24:40.356]  They see an opportunity.
[00:24:40.416 --> 00:24:41.857]  It's like blood in the water.
[00:24:41.897 --> 00:24:45.000]  They're coming in to get them in debt to the bankers.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.643]  And of course, we've been telling you and many others have been telling you that
[00:24:49.383 --> 00:24:55.388]  We believe that this was set up by the bankers in the first place to get them in the sphere and influence of the EU.
[00:24:55.428 --> 00:25:01.634]  You know, they might want to watch the debate that's coming up between Nigel Farage and Nick Clegg in the UK.
[00:25:02.114 --> 00:25:05.698]  Of course, we've talked to Nigel Farage here on the radio show many times.
[00:25:06.058 --> 00:25:07.719]  A masterful debater.
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:11.403]  This guy is amazing and he goes right to the heart of the EU.
[00:25:11.983 --> 00:25:28.149]  He's elected to the EU as an opponent to the EU and he's the guy who stands up and calls them out on their takeovers of countries like Greece and Italy where they take out duly elected prime ministers and put in Goldman Sachs bankers.
[00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:30.990]  It's just amazing what they're doing in the EU.
[00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:31.550]  So before
[00:25:32.389 --> 00:25:36.472]  The Ukraine throws itself into the EU basket.
[00:25:36.532 --> 00:25:53.402]  They ought to take a look at what's being done in countries like Greece, like Italy, see what the bankers are doing there and of course now the bankers are starting to come in offering them the lure of money to try to get them under their control just as they've done the United States and so many other countries.
[00:25:53.442 --> 00:25:56.705]  So we'll be talking to Paul Joseph Watson at the bottom of the hour about that.
[00:25:57.065 --> 00:26:01.628]  Now we went out in the last segment with a clip from Rachel Maddow.
[00:26:02.785 --> 00:26:17.926]  And she's questioning the assassination, and folks, if you're picked up by the FBI and you tell people they're gonna kill me, and you're in a room full of FBI agents, you're unarmed, and you get shot six times, and then once in the back of the head,
[00:26:18.874 --> 00:26:20.116]  That's an execution, folks.
[00:26:20.156 --> 00:26:21.378]  That's not a questioning.
[00:26:21.758 --> 00:26:24.021]  That's exactly what he knew was going to happen.
[00:26:24.522 --> 00:26:28.908]  And it's about time that somebody in the mainstream media complained about that.
[00:26:28.928 --> 00:26:34.115]  You know, I think Rachel Maddow came around to do this because it just looks ridiculous.
[00:26:34.656 --> 00:26:36.537]  For them to ignore this.
[00:26:36.817 --> 00:26:38.218]  They're losing all their credibility.
[00:26:38.518 --> 00:26:41.460]  That's why Piers Morgan's ratings were down in the tank.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.041]  He had no credibility.
[00:26:43.421 --> 00:26:44.842]  So I think they see the handwriting on the wall.
[00:26:44.882 --> 00:26:46.543]  I think they see that they need to do that.
[00:26:46.783 --> 00:26:47.503]  Even CNN.
[00:26:48.024 --> 00:26:55.368]  Even CNN that was really twisting and turning the government's narrative on both Sandy Hook and the Boston bombing.
[00:26:55.548 --> 00:26:57.889]  Even CNN is questioning this.
[00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:03.373]  Let's play a little bit of this clip from CNN where they're questioning the Boston bombing and the events surrounding that on CNN.
[00:27:04.973 --> 00:27:12.800]  Do they perhaps then not see that there's a wider role that Tordeshev and others may not have had anything to do with the bombings at the Marathon?
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:17.044]  Like I told you before, all we have is this one official statement.
[00:27:17.924 --> 00:27:26.192]  It's the FBI's contention that Ibrahim Tordeshev implicated Tamerlan Tsarnaev in that grisly, grisly triple murder in Waltham.
[00:27:28.133 --> 00:27:30.294]  So you have to say there's a lot of questions here.
[00:27:30.334 --> 00:27:56.781]  I mean my investigation starts with Waltham and there are a lot of leads that local officials didn't go through there and then it ends in actually late fall where I find the FBI is still reaching out to Ibrahim Todeshev's friends asking him very very basic questions about the Boston... Well while that may have been you know at least some respite for these victims families in Waltham who have been waiting and waiting for some sort of solution
[00:27:57.381 --> 00:27:59.723]  I don't think that was a... I think that's where you're wrong.
[00:27:59.763 --> 00:28:00.764]  It's not at all.
[00:28:00.784 --> 00:28:03.666]  I mean, the victim's families are really, really hurting here.
[00:28:03.686 --> 00:28:03.946]  Devastated.
[00:28:04.066 --> 00:28:07.009]  I mean, we had a... Let me just ask you one question.
[00:28:07.049 --> 00:28:10.792]  There was one spot where I just stopped and my mouth dropped open, and that was this.
[00:28:11.132 --> 00:28:20.419]  The girlfriend of Toda Shev is perhaps the only person who can give us any insight what his reaction was when he heard about the bombings, i.e.
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:29.546]  Did she suspect he may have known something about it when he heard about the bombings and the death of Tamerlan, that maybe something was afoot?
[00:28:30.046 --> 00:28:40.694]  All she says she told me is she was in the condo with him and he heard about the Boston Marathon bombings, it, assumably after Tamerlan Cernayev died, and he was very, very sad.
[00:28:41.134 --> 00:28:44.737]  Maybe just sad for the death of a friend or sad for the reality of it all?
[00:28:45.037 --> 00:28:46.478]  I mean, it's hard to say.
[00:28:46.558 --> 00:28:47.758]  I mean, it's hard to say.
[00:28:48.418 --> 00:28:50.579]  We just know that they were good friends.
[00:28:51.299 --> 00:28:53.480]  And there's a lot of questions here.
[00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:57.562]  Shockingly, as good friends, it's amazing he wasn't investigated back in 2011.
[00:28:57.702 --> 00:28:58.582]  It's a great piece.
[00:28:58.602 --> 00:28:59.742]  You've done a lot of work.
[00:28:59.782 --> 00:29:01.883]  I highly recommend people take a look.
[00:29:02.103 --> 00:29:05.004]  There is a lot that you have uncovered and you've written about it.
[00:29:05.024 --> 00:29:05.965]  Well, that's it.
[00:29:06.005 --> 00:29:07.065]  That's CNN, folks.
[00:29:07.145 --> 00:29:12.047]  That's CNN taking a critical look at the government's narrative about the Boston bombing.
[00:29:13.012 --> 00:29:13.693]  They were set up.
[00:29:14.073 --> 00:29:15.495]  They were working with the CIA.
[00:29:15.535 --> 00:29:17.778]  You can see them going back and forth into Russia.
[00:29:17.818 --> 00:29:19.681]  You can see Russia asking them questions about this.
[00:29:20.422 --> 00:29:25.328]  Just as the American government is doing in the Ukraine, they've been pushing in Chechnya.
[00:29:25.368 --> 00:29:27.131]  You've got Uncle Sarnaev who is
[00:29:28.072 --> 00:29:31.614]  Married to the head of the CIA station in that area?
[00:29:31.734 --> 00:29:32.474]  I mean, come on.
[00:29:32.534 --> 00:29:34.896]  This is as phony as it gets, folks.
[00:29:35.376 --> 00:29:38.077]  And the government is not above their own conspiracies.
[00:29:38.117 --> 00:29:42.440]  We've got them saying that Barrett Brown and Anonymous were plotting to overthrow the government.
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:43.540]  How absurd does it get?
[00:29:44.081 --> 00:29:50.504]  They got Barrett Browning in jail in Dallas because he'd linked to some data on a website.
[00:29:50.744 --> 00:29:52.265]  Can they throw people in jail for that?
[00:29:52.705 --> 00:29:54.526]  Our government is out of control.
[00:29:54.546 --> 00:29:57.048]  We're going to be right back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:29:57.068 --> 00:29:57.448]  Stay tuned.
[00:29:59.341 --> 00:30:02.328]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:05.936]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.043 --> 00:30:11.664]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:30:11.924 --> 00:30:15.446]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:30:15.586 --> 00:30:19.988]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:30:20.128 --> 00:30:26.111]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:30:26.231 --> 00:30:37.016]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[00:30:37.216 --> 00:30:43.520]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:31:00.709]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia, and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:05.392]  Get your ProPure with the new Pro1 filters today at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:31:05.652 --> 00:31:07.534]  Or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:31:07.674 --> 00:31:10.576]  The facts are in.
[00:31:10.736 --> 00:31:11.877]  The studies are legion.
[00:31:12.157 --> 00:31:19.502]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:31:19.662 --> 00:31:23.105]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:31:23.465 --> 00:31:23.885]  Simple.
[00:31:24.045 --> 00:31:28.488]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:31:28.768 --> 00:31:34.232]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:31:34.492 --> 00:31:50.502]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Live Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:31:50.802 --> 00:31:55.046]  Let's take a stand against the Globalist by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[00:31:55.386 --> 00:31:57.228]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.

[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:18.647]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:32:18.747 --> 00:32:26.974]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:32:27.154 --> 00:32:31.858]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:32:32.038 --> 00:32:38.423]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:38.803 --> 00:32:45.869]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:32:45.969 --> 00:32:52.855]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:32:53.015 --> 00:32:57.359]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:32:57.499 --> 00:33:00.702]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:33:00.862 --> 00:33:07.024]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:33:07.164 --> 00:33:08.864]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:08.944 --> 00:33:13.925]  Generals gathered in their masses.
[00:33:22.299 --> 00:33:25.763]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[00:33:26.224 --> 00:33:29.167]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:33:29.207 --> 00:33:30.368]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:37.812]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:37.892 --> 00:33:39.073]  I'm David Knight here in Austin.
[00:33:39.113 --> 00:33:41.954]  I'm filling in for Alex today on this Thursday, February 27, 2014.
[00:33:42.894 --> 00:33:50.298]  And I'm going to be joined here by Paul Joseph Watson, who is one of our writers here, as well as a reporter.
[00:33:50.838 --> 00:33:57.082]  And he's an expert on what's going on in Europe with the IMF, with the EU, and with the Ukraine.
[00:33:57.182 --> 00:34:03.345]  And so Paul has published many stories about this as it's developing, talking about how the bankers are trying to
[00:34:04.185 --> 00:34:05.927]  Get the Ukraine under their control.
[00:34:05.987 --> 00:34:07.388]  We also see how the U.S.
[00:34:07.468 --> 00:34:11.972]  is trying to increase tension between Russia and America.
[00:34:12.632 --> 00:34:18.077]  And of course, that serves the interests of the military-industrial complex as well, doesn't it?
[00:34:18.157 --> 00:34:23.982]  They were searching around for a mission once the Soviet Union fell apart and they didn't have a credible enemy anymore.
[00:34:24.062 --> 00:34:29.367]  So now they're creating credible enemies everywhere, just like they've done since World War II.
[00:34:29.967 --> 00:34:31.789]  So joining us now is Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:34:31.809 --> 00:34:32.570]  Paul, how are you doing?
[00:34:33.567 --> 00:34:34.708]  Hi David, good to be back.
[00:34:35.208 --> 00:34:35.768]  Great to have you.
[00:34:35.788 --> 00:34:43.632]  Now you want to talk about the IMF and they're jumping into the water here, offering all kinds of money to the Ukraine people.
[00:34:43.692 --> 00:34:46.373]  Just come on in and sign on the bottom line, right?
[00:34:46.413 --> 00:34:50.616]  It's like a kid that just graduated from college getting all these credit card offers, right?
[00:34:52.896 --> 00:34:53.837]  It's amazing, David.
[00:34:54.277 --> 00:35:04.264]  The situation right now is we've seen the faux revolution stirred up by the West, by the NGOs, by the United States, by Britain.
[00:35:04.765 --> 00:35:11.710]  Now we're seeing the counter-revolution which is being stirred up by Russia and which is centred in the Crimea.
[00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:16.194]  The area of Ukraine to the south where Russia has a naval base.
[00:35:16.654 --> 00:35:24.482]  So we basically got a massive arms buildup with Russia preparing fighter jets on combat alert.
[00:35:24.882 --> 00:35:29.847]  They've put out statements saying they've got 150,000 troops ready for a drill.
[00:35:30.368 --> 00:35:33.531]  Ukraine is warning against that military buildup.
[00:35:34.251 --> 00:35:36.012]  As is the United States.
[00:35:36.072 --> 00:35:42.355]  We've got deployment of a US aircraft carrier, which was planned in advance, but some are saying it's related to the building tension.
[00:35:43.075 --> 00:35:52.519]  And then we've got the fact, and this is the key to this entire story, on InfoWars.com, Central Banker appointed as Prime Minister of Ukraine.
[00:35:53.883 --> 00:36:10.975]  Three weeks ago, the top US State Department diplomat in Europe, Victoria Nuland, was involved in a leaked phone conversation with another top US diplomat, and they were basically plotting the overthrow of the democratically elected Ukrainian government.
[00:36:11.335 --> 00:36:22.183]  And the very person that Nuland named in that leaked phone conversation, that they would choose to become the new Prime Minister of the Ukraine, Arseniy Yatsenyuk,
[00:36:22.743 --> 00:36:34.038]  Is now the new head of the Ukraine, so the very person they named three weeks in advance is now in power, proving once again that this was an act of regime change.
[00:36:34.338 --> 00:36:36.401]  Oh yeah, and it was even more than that, Paul.
[00:36:36.421 --> 00:36:39.845]  You know, I had Steve Pichinik on the nightly news and I talked to him about that.
[00:36:40.606 --> 00:36:50.468]  Phone conversation that supposedly was just amazing tradecraft and the the American administration said, I just can't believe that the Russians would listen to our phones like that.
[00:36:50.488 --> 00:36:52.889]  Steve Pchenik said that was the phoniest thing you've ever heard of.
[00:36:53.189 --> 00:36:55.670]  The fact that they would do this on an open line.
[00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:57.950]  They wanted the Russians to know this.
[00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:00.251]  They wanted the world to know this.
[00:37:00.471 --> 00:37:02.811]  It was an in-your-face demonstration.
[00:37:02.831 --> 00:37:04.452]  It was provocative.
[00:37:04.892 --> 00:37:05.872]  It was trying to
[00:37:06.352 --> 00:37:09.216]  It's basically just hubris, but it's also very provocative.
[00:37:09.236 --> 00:37:12.880]  They're trying to provoke tension between the U.S.
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:13.460]  and Russia.
[00:37:13.781 --> 00:37:23.252]  Not just pull the Ukraine out of Russia's sphere, but the Crimea is vitally important to Russia because that's their access to water, to the Black Sea.
[00:37:24.827 --> 00:37:30.572]  Well, it would be like Russia stirring up a revolution in Canada or Mexico.
[00:37:31.433 --> 00:37:39.079]  Or even, you could think about it, if Scotland gained independence, it would be like Russia stirring up a revolution in Scotland, targeting England.
[00:37:39.459 --> 00:37:45.304]  It's that sensitive because Ukraine is fundamentally linked to Russia historically.
[00:37:45.665 --> 00:37:46.866]  It's been part of Russia
[00:37:47.526 --> 00:37:50.188]  For the majority of the past 100 years, of course.
[00:37:50.688 --> 00:37:59.113]  And as you said, this leaked phone conversation, the media treatment of it was the fact that Newland said, F the EU.
[00:37:59.233 --> 00:38:01.414]  And that's what all the headlines became about.
[00:38:01.875 --> 00:38:04.356]  Oh my God, she's saying F the EU.
[00:38:04.396 --> 00:38:05.557]  That wasn't the story.
[00:38:05.637 --> 00:38:13.402]  The story was they were picking by name the future leaders of Ukraine in the overthrow, the coup d'etat that they were planning.
[00:38:14.082 --> 00:38:24.348]  And now we see that that's come to pass, even though Russia started this counter-revolution against it as part of the new Cold War that is emerging, the NATO encirclement of Russia.
[00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:35.695]  Now that that's come to pass in its first stage, the IMF is circling the wagons, its vultures are preparing to swoop on Ukraine to asset-strip the country.
[00:38:36.215 --> 00:38:42.379]  As part of their tried and tested IMF riot plan as Greg Palast exposed back in 2001.
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:45.822]  And today the Associated Press reports that...
[00:38:46.693 --> 00:38:58.445]  The IMF is sending officials to the Ukraine to start discussing with the Ukrainian authorities which policy reforms would be required in exchange for an emergency loan program.
[00:38:58.966 --> 00:39:07.374]  So, in other words, again, just as they did in Greece, this is about turning Ukraine into the IMF, the globalist debt slave, by
[00:39:07.975 --> 00:39:24.334]  Creating the loan shark environment where they have to sell off infrastructure, they have to impose draconian austerity measures, high taxes on their population as happened in Greece, and install technocrats in the government who basically serve as puppets to the IMF, to the globalists.
[00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:25.090]  Absolutely.
[00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:30.672]  You know, Bloomberg reports that they're going to give, that they're offering them, a $35 billion deal.
[00:39:30.752 --> 00:39:33.373]  And of course, that's much better than what the Russians were giving them.
[00:39:33.413 --> 00:39:37.254]  The Russians were only giving them $15 billion that they've halted.
[00:39:37.334 --> 00:39:40.676]  So they're going to get them totally in debt, like you just mentioned.
[00:39:40.696 --> 00:39:41.376]  They're going to
[00:39:42.176 --> 00:40:04.773]  Raise their taxes, they're going to control their country, and they may wind up with a situation, you know, one of the previous premiers in the Ukraine was formerly a central banker in the Ukraine, so he was the one who was on the other side from Yanukovych, and Yanukovych, I don't know if I've got the emphasis on the right syllable there, but I always get confused about the Russian names, but he was a central banker.
[00:40:05.013 --> 00:40:06.655]  The guy for the opposing party
[00:40:07.395 --> 00:40:08.839]  But he was a Ukraine central banker.
[00:40:08.939 --> 00:40:11.406]  These are the guys who've already spent, what is it, Paul?
[00:40:11.466 --> 00:40:14.133]  Five billion dollars to start this revolution there?
[00:40:15.202 --> 00:40:32.593]  Yeah, I mean, Newland announced back in December, around the same time that John McCain went to Ukraine and was buddy-buddy with all these Nazis that are part of the opposition movement, Newland announced that the US had already invested $5 billion in the protest movement in Ukraine.
[00:40:33.013 --> 00:40:35.234]  So again, that shows you they were prepared for this.
[00:40:35.274 --> 00:40:41.258]  The initial protest started, of course, back in November when Ukraine rejected the EU trade deal and went with Russia.
[00:40:41.938 --> 00:41:04.270]  But before that, they knew that this was coming because research shows, and this is linked in my article, that these democratic uprisings, whatever you want to call them, whether they're grassroots or not, whether they're grassroots to begin with and then hijacked by Western powers at a later date, they're entirely predictable because they're linked to
[00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:06.771]  The rise in food prices.
[00:41:06.811 --> 00:41:20.235]  You can track where unrest is going to happen in countries around the world based on if food prices rise above a certain level, which is the UN Food and Agriculture Organization's food price index.
[00:41:20.615 --> 00:41:26.216]  Whenever that index rises above 210, the unrest quickly follows in all these different countries.
[00:41:26.517 --> 00:41:27.437]  You can track it from
[00:41:28.277 --> 00:41:35.762]  Syria, Tunisia of course with the Arab Spring, and most recently Thailand, Venezuela, and you guessed it, Ukraine.
[00:41:36.202 --> 00:41:40.665]  So they know ahead of time when these uprisings are really going to pick up steam.
[00:41:41.066 --> 00:41:51.533]  So even if you believe, which of course a lot of these Euromaidan protesters are dupes, they're useful idiots, even if you believe that it's an organic uprising to begin with, these
[00:41:52.373 --> 00:42:15.502]  Democratic revolutions, as they call them, are seen years in advance by the US State Department, which is why the State Department knew as far back as 2008 that the Arab Spring was coming, which is why they had some of their top operators with these NGOs, also linked to the CFR, like Larry Diamond, actually training the Arab Spring leaders
[00:42:15.842 --> 00:42:20.064]  On how to effectively use Twitter and Facebook to stir up these revolutions.
[00:42:20.404 --> 00:42:36.152]  And as I documented in my expose of the I am a Ukrainian PR stunt, the very same individual, Larry Diamond, CFR member, linked to the State Department, has done extensive work for the NED, National Endowment for Democracy.
[00:42:36.992 --> 00:42:58.958]  He was the one behind this viral video which was basically glib propaganda trying to portray the uprising in Ukraine as exactly that, just a grassroots democratic uprising, when in fact he was the one years ago training Arab Spring activists on behalf of the US State Department on how to foment faux revolutions.
[00:42:59.078 --> 00:43:00.579]  And in fact they did it
[00:43:01.099 --> 00:43:17.417]  In the very same hotel that we visited last year for Bilderberg, because we spoke to the hotel staff, the manager, and he said, yeah, we had all these guys here back in 2008 talking about the Arab Spring, three years before it happened.
[00:43:17.937 --> 00:43:28.748]  So they know when these riots are coming, they have people prepared to train the leaders, and of course Soros' Open Society Institute is involved in that as well, on the ground with the actual protesters.
[00:43:29.269 --> 00:43:35.155]  So they know how to manage these controlled uprisings, even if they're grassroots to begin with.
[00:43:35.635 --> 00:43:44.885]  Well, it's very interesting that you mentioned that they see this as a leading indicator, the price of food, because we just see in the news today that cattle futures in the U.S.
[00:43:44.925 --> 00:43:46.687]  have hit a record level.
[00:43:47.408 --> 00:43:51.552]  And we see that there's a real war on independent farms here in America.
[00:43:51.612 --> 00:43:55.476]  We've got some articles about that that we've been covering on the nightly news the last week or so.
[00:43:56.437 --> 00:44:02.218]  They're coming after farmers in just so many different levels, and it reminds me of what happened in the Ukraine.
[00:44:02.238 --> 00:44:14.821]  You know, Stalin's approach to the Ukraine, and one of the gripes that the Ukrainian people have that is a legitimate gripe is they remember the Holodomor, the starvation that was propagated against the Ukrainian people under Stalin.
[00:44:15.281 --> 00:44:17.982]  We see, however, some of these same tactics
[00:44:18.562 --> 00:44:21.084]  That are going to be used here in America.
[00:44:21.124 --> 00:44:25.446]  We've got the government coming in and shutting down farms over nonsense reasons.
[00:44:25.466 --> 00:44:30.569]  They're now telling organic farmers that they can't use manure or have animals plow their fields.
[00:44:31.049 --> 00:44:34.512]  This has been going on for millennia that this has happened.
[00:44:34.532 --> 00:44:37.373]  But now you're going to have to buy commercial fertilizer, that sort of thing.
[00:44:37.393 --> 00:44:39.715]  But we see the prices going on here.
[00:44:39.735 --> 00:44:43.237]  We see the preparation in America that is our government
[00:44:43.897 --> 00:44:50.706]  Giving military vehicles to police departments, buying billions of rounds of hollow point ammunition, not target rounds.
[00:44:51.027 --> 00:44:54.091]  As you pointed out, you were the spearheading that research, Paul.
[00:44:54.431 --> 00:45:00.840]  It's very worrying to see these kind of leading indicators coming here, but besides just the Ukrainian people,
[00:45:01.621 --> 00:45:10.607]  Getting out of the control of one gang of thugs and under the control of these bankers in Europe, these central bankers, Goldman Sachs and others.
[00:45:11.267 --> 00:45:13.909]  The other aspect of this is the military build-up.
[00:45:13.929 --> 00:45:18.232]  You had an article today about Russia puts fighter jets on combat alert as tensions mount.
[00:45:18.252 --> 00:45:26.617]  I mean, the Crimea is vitally important to the Russians from a strategic standpoint, just as Ukraine is from a food standpoint.
[00:45:28.464 --> 00:45:31.108]  Precisely, and that's the biggest danger, isn't it?
[00:45:31.308 --> 00:45:35.454]  And now a lot of top analysts are saying this is the start of a new Cold War.
[00:45:35.634 --> 00:45:35.815]  Yes.
[00:45:35.955 --> 00:45:44.507]  You could see it coming beforehand because Russia and China have been engaged in some of the biggest military build-ups and aggressive military rhetoric.
[00:45:45.568 --> 00:45:49.851]  For the past decade or so, I mean, I've written several articles over the past few months.
[00:45:50.711 --> 00:45:54.914]  China conducting attacks on mock US aircraft carriers.
[00:45:55.614 --> 00:46:04.259]  They're putting out editorials in state media talking about how the President of China is preparing the PLA for a new giant war.
[00:46:04.859 --> 00:46:12.424]  And then you had the display for the recent Land Rover program in China, where the backdrop for the image was
[00:46:13.204 --> 00:46:15.845]  A picture of a mushroom cloud over Europe.
[00:46:16.626 --> 00:46:17.746]  It was just an accident.
[00:46:18.286 --> 00:46:24.929]  But continued state media editorials in Chinese media talking about targeting the US militarily.
[00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:29.011]  China, of course, just got its first actual aircraft carrier.
[00:46:29.031 --> 00:46:31.072]  They're talking about building more of those.
[00:46:32.953 --> 00:46:37.655]  It's Iran, Russia and China lined up against the United States.
[00:46:37.675 --> 00:47:00.846]  It is a new Cold War and the fact that neoliberals and neoconservatives are willing to foster that by antagonizing Russia by fostering this revolution right on its border just shows how insanely diabolical their plans are and the fact that they have no genuine concern about the future of the world because they're creating a situation
[00:47:01.446 --> 00:47:03.827]  Which could go hot very, very soon.
[00:47:03.867 --> 00:47:10.210]  Now we've got analysts, even BBC analysts, talking about a, quote, hot war in Ukraine.
[00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:11.650]  So, it's crazy.
[00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:14.111]  Well, the war is the lifeblood of the state, isn't it?
[00:47:14.292 --> 00:47:19.474]  And you've got both the American government as well as the Chinese government as well as the Russian government.
[00:47:20.254 --> 00:47:27.098]  They all can make themselves more important in everybody's lives if they create fear about an outbreak of war.
[00:47:27.158 --> 00:47:38.765]  But again, you see, in this build-up here in the Ukraine, if that fosters another Cold War, if that fosters another military build-up with a military-industrial complex, who benefits from that?
[00:47:38.805 --> 00:47:43.588]  Well, of course, the same bankers that are trying to get control of the Ukraine, isn't it?
[00:47:45.265 --> 00:47:51.435]  Well precisely and it also distracts from domestic unrest in America because as you were talking about before
[00:47:52.831 --> 00:48:01.817]  Again, the food price issue in America, once that builds, once people's wallets begin to be hit more and more, there is a potential for unrest.
[00:48:01.857 --> 00:48:16.207]  I mean, I did the article yesterday, Pat Caddell, former presidential advisor and pollster, basically said that the soft depression that Americans are currently experiencing could lead to a Kiev-style uprising in the United States.
[00:48:16.367 --> 00:48:17.988]  And then, of course, you have the U.S.
[00:48:18.108 --> 00:48:20.730]  Army building fake towns, $96 million worth,
[00:48:22.711 --> 00:48:22.891]  Yeah.
[00:48:37.688 --> 00:48:38.808]  It's multifaceted.
[00:48:38.868 --> 00:48:54.172]  Yes, it's for foreign occupation, but it's also for domestic preparation because we know that Fort Hood soldiers and others are being trained that Christians, Tea Party supporters, anti-abortion activists are a radical terror threat.
[00:48:54.232 --> 00:48:55.772]  We've had those articles in the past.
[00:48:56.752 --> 00:48:59.373]  Department of Homeland Security, of course, in its own
[00:48:59.973 --> 00:49:08.937]  funded document describes liberty lovers, that's their quote, liberty lovers, as domestic extremists, links them alongside terrorists.
[00:49:09.357 --> 00:49:21.641]  So you have a federal government in the United States that's increasingly paranoid about its own citizens, which is why they can unite the country around an external threat, which again benefits the military-industrial complex.
[00:49:22.042 --> 00:49:27.944]  Yeah, you know, we tried to get them to talk to us at the Asymmetric Warfare Center there in Virginia, where they built that city,
[00:49:29.073 --> 00:49:35.033]  You know, Paul, it was originally going to be like $60 million and they went 50% over budget on that.
[00:49:35.851 --> 00:49:38.172]  But we wanted to ask them some questions about that.
[00:49:38.272 --> 00:49:39.952]  I wanted to see if they really did have a mosque.
[00:49:39.992 --> 00:49:41.513]  Did you ever see a picture of a mosque there?
[00:49:41.533 --> 00:49:45.093]  Because all I saw was the footage that they put out.
[00:49:45.173 --> 00:49:50.295]  We use that in our report, but all I saw was a small-town Christian church.
[00:49:50.315 --> 00:49:52.435]  Did you see any other pictures that actually showed a mosque?
[00:49:52.455 --> 00:49:55.456]  Or did they say that they had a mosque other than the article?
[00:49:55.496 --> 00:50:01.298]  No, I actually saw the picture of the mosque with the minaret, but they also had, as you said, a Christian church.
[00:50:03.279 --> 00:50:07.782]  We're all being targeted, whether it's Muslims in the Middle East or Americans at home.
[00:50:07.842 --> 00:50:13.045]  I don't think you'd find many small Christian churches like that in a lot of Muslim countries.
[00:50:13.125 --> 00:50:15.727]  So, yeah, it's targeting all of us.
[00:50:15.927 --> 00:50:17.748]  Well, it's clearly an American city.
[00:50:18.429 --> 00:50:22.472]  They had handicap parking signs, they had speed limit signs, they had...
[00:50:23.504 --> 00:50:26.427]  A subway there with the logo from the Washington D.C.
[00:50:26.487 --> 00:50:26.847]  subway.
[00:50:26.887 --> 00:50:29.530]  I mean, everything was very, very detailed.
[00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:39.960]  I found another video where they were actually laying down the slab when they were in the construction process and it actually showed them stubbing up electrical and plumbing.
[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:44.484]  I mean, these are not shells of buildings like they have trained with in the past.
[00:50:44.604 --> 00:50:46.085]  This is something where they are training.
[00:50:46.326 --> 00:50:47.166]  They see us.
[00:50:47.987 --> 00:50:56.895]  As the insurgents in an asymmetric warfare, and it's very clear based on the research that you've done about the ammunition purchases, what we see happening with these military vehicles.
[00:50:57.375 --> 00:51:00.017]  When we come back, I want to ask you about what's going on in Scotland.
[00:51:00.057 --> 00:51:07.223]  We reported on this a year ago, but now Scotland has passed a law that has tremendous implications for parents.
[00:51:07.744 --> 00:51:09.885]  We're going to talk to Paul Joseph Watson right after this break.
[00:51:10.486 --> 00:51:14.769]  I don't know how virtually anyone can hack or track a wireless device.
[00:51:15.029 --> 00:51:20.773]  It's Keith from Block It Pocket with a warning about hackers and Big Brother monitoring your mobile device.
[00:51:20.953 --> 00:51:25.717]  Block It Pocket essentially blocks out any outgoing or incoming signals.
[00:51:25.957 --> 00:51:28.839]  Yes, even when the phone is off and the battery removed.

[00:52:09.795 --> 00:52:10.636]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:52:10.816 --> 00:52:16.139]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:52:16.339 --> 00:52:16.760]  I get it.
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:26.246]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:52:26.466 --> 00:52:27.667]  That's not what's happening.
[00:52:27.867 --> 00:52:36.092]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:52:36.332 --> 00:52:37.573]  If all looks rosy to you,
[00:52:37.793 --> 00:52:39.554]  Then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:52:39.694 --> 00:52:43.757]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:52:43.937 --> 00:52:45.498]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:52:45.538 --> 00:52:48.761]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:52:49.501 --> 00:52:53.104]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:52:53.284 --> 00:52:54.004]  You should, too.
[00:52:54.205 --> 00:52:55.165]  Find out what they know.

[00:52:59.008 --> 00:52:59.208]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:10.402]  Introducing Pro-1.

[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:28.641]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides
[00:53:49.085 --> 00:53:59.410]  Chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[00:54:19.497 --> 00:54:24.864]  Well, I think I see another side, maybe mister.
[00:54:25.285 --> 00:54:27.488]  Another light that shines.
[00:54:28.449 --> 00:54:36.160]  And I look over now, through the door, and I still belong to no one.
[00:54:39.804 --> 00:54:41.425]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:41.485 --> 00:54:49.448]  I'm David Knight filling in for Alex and I'm joined on the line with Paul Joseph Watson, one of our esteemed writers and commentators.
[00:54:49.508 --> 00:54:58.832]  He's in the UK and we've been talking about the IMF and the international bankers making their move as they've been telegraphing for quite some time.
[00:54:58.872 --> 00:54:59.953]  Now it's become very obvious.
[00:54:59.973 --> 00:55:01.994]  They've actually put a price tag on it.
[00:55:02.234 --> 00:55:02.894]  35 million dollars.
[00:55:02.934 --> 00:55:06.156]  That's the price of the freedom of the Ukrainian people.
[00:55:06.176 --> 00:55:06.516]  They're gonna
[00:55:07.577 --> 00:55:12.199]  Loot them and rob them five different ways as they've always done everybody when they come in and take over.
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:15.621]  But now, Paul, I wanted to talk to you about this law that just passed.
[00:55:15.661 --> 00:55:19.303]  We covered this when it came out a year ago, practically in April.
[00:55:20.243 --> 00:55:26.186]  Last year, they were putting forth a bill in Scotland called the Children and Young People's Bill.
[00:55:26.267 --> 00:55:30.549]  And, of course, this is going to, this now passed just within the last week.
[00:55:31.389 --> 00:55:40.831]  And it is going to assign a government guardian to every child in Scotland from birth until 18 years old.
[00:55:41.431 --> 00:55:42.051]  That's amazing!
[00:55:43.031 --> 00:55:54.994]  I mean, there's a lot of reaction from that, from the Christian community there, from people who understand the purpose of the family and who are concerned about government intrusions in the family.
[00:55:55.014 --> 00:55:56.114]  What's your take on this, Paul?
[00:55:57.006 --> 00:56:01.108]  Well, David, I mean, this is chilling cradle-to-grave tyranny.
[00:56:01.228 --> 00:56:09.511]  Imagine if they uncovered an Obamacare regulation which said, oh, by the way, the government has a minder assigned to every child in the United States up to the age of 18.
[00:56:09.731 --> 00:56:11.272]  There would be an outcry.
[00:56:11.592 --> 00:56:15.113]  Yet this bill has passed, largely unopposed in Scotland.
[00:56:15.654 --> 00:56:16.394]  Every child
[00:56:17.014 --> 00:56:24.538]  The NHS will appoint a health worker to act as a named person, a guardian, for every child up until the age of five.
[00:56:24.898 --> 00:56:27.659]  Then it passes over to the local government council.
[00:56:28.199 --> 00:56:38.724]  They will assign individuals to monitor every single child in Scotland to, quote, ensure any potential cases of abuse or developmental difficulties are spotted and acted upon.
[00:56:39.284 --> 00:56:40.085]  What does that mean?
[00:56:40.145 --> 00:56:44.127]  Well, in the UK, just as in the US with the CPS,
[00:56:45.071 --> 00:56:48.373]  They steal children to meet quotas.
[00:56:48.834 --> 00:56:52.356]  In the case of the UK, it's adoption quotas.
[00:56:52.757 --> 00:57:01.843]  We've had a case just in the past week where a four-year-old boy was torn from a loving middle-class family simply to meet an adoption quota.
[00:57:02.143 --> 00:57:09.068]  We've had cases in Colchester, Essex recently, where a family had seven children.
[00:57:09.128 --> 00:57:10.489]  They attempted to have another baby.
[00:57:10.509 --> 00:57:11.210]  They had the baby.
[00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:17.255]  It was taken away from them by the government because the government said their family was too large.
[00:57:17.616 --> 00:57:21.399]  We've had children taken away from families because they're quote too fat.
[00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:25.543]  And then we've had babies removed for apparently no reason whatsoever.
[00:57:26.043 --> 00:57:31.148]  So this is about making it easier for the state to steal people's children.
[00:57:31.689 --> 00:57:37.314]  And then you connect it to other articles like last year I believe it was or a couple of years ago
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:43.102]  There was a family in Northern England, not far from where I used to live in Rotherham.
[00:57:43.722 --> 00:57:46.183]  They were members of the UK Independence Party.
[00:57:46.603 --> 00:57:52.665]  The parents were the foster parents, which is a major party expected to win the European Parliamentary elections.
[00:57:53.146 --> 00:58:04.250]  The local council removed their two foster children because they were members of that political party, because according to the council, the party is, quote, racist,
[00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:07.751]  Because it opposes mass uncontrolled immigration.
[00:58:08.111 --> 00:58:26.737]  And despite the fact that these foster parents had had a fantastic track record, loving parents with numerous different children, numerous different backgrounds and ethnicities, they took the children away because they were members of a political party, a mainstream political party, that opposes immigration.
[00:58:27.177 --> 00:58:28.898]  So that's why they're doing it.
[00:58:29.178 --> 00:58:31.079]  Well, we can see this happening in America.
[00:58:31.119 --> 00:58:44.124]  We have this Connecticut teenager whose parents took her to Massachusetts to get treatment, and because one hospital, Tufts, said that it was a physical problem, Boston Children's Hospital said it was a mental problem, they took that decision away from the parents.
[00:58:44.504 --> 00:58:45.685]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:58:45.705 --> 00:58:46.565]  We see where this is headed.
[00:58:47.045 --> 00:58:47.606]  Thanks, Paul.
[00:58:47.666 --> 00:58:48.466]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:50.507 --> 00:58:54.068]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:54.088 --> 00:58:55.909]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:59.838 --> 00:59:10.185]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:59:10.525 --> 00:59:12.366]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:59:12.566 --> 00:59:13.267]  Fluoride!
[00:59:13.467 --> 00:59:15.268]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:59:15.388 --> 00:59:21.692]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:59:21.952 --> 00:59:26.735]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:59:26.875 --> 00:59:32.959]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:35.361]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[00:59:35.621 --> 00:59:38.243]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[00:59:38.543 --> 00:59:41.925]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[00:59:42.045 --> 00:59:46.649]  You will find survival shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at Infowarslife.com.

[01:00:05.343 --> 01:00:08.086]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:14.847 --> 01:00:15.488]  Big Brother.
[01:00:16.148 --> 01:00:17.170]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:19.012]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:19.672 --> 01:00:20.473]  You want answers?
[01:00:21.254 --> 01:00:22.155]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:22.796 --> 01:00:26.440]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.045]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.884 --> 01:00:34.205]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:34.265 --> 01:00:38.568]  I'm David Knight filling in for Alex and I've got on the phone Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[01:00:39.169 --> 01:00:50.217]  And we were just talking about this outrageous bill that was passed by the Scottish legislature that is going to assign a government minder to every child from birth until the age of 18.
[01:00:53.055 --> 01:01:00.580]  And Paul was just recounting how they've had situations in the UK where children were taken from a family because of the judgment of the government.
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:02.281]  They had too many children.
[01:01:03.041 --> 01:01:06.383]  How they were taken from a family because of their political affiliation.
[01:01:06.423 --> 01:01:08.385]  Of course, it was a mainstream political party.
[01:01:08.405 --> 01:01:12.767]  It wasn't the top two biggest parties, but it's a party that is coming up, the UK Independence Party.
[01:01:13.288 --> 01:01:18.271]  And I was just starting to talk about this case here in Boston, in Massachusetts, where a Connecticut family
[01:01:18.911 --> 01:01:20.292]  ...was seeking help for their daughter.
[01:01:20.932 --> 01:01:24.675]  You have two different hospitals, one of them Tufts, the other one Boston's Children's Hospital.
[01:01:25.255 --> 01:01:27.157]  Tufts says it's a physical problem.
[01:01:28.308 --> 01:01:30.890]  Boston Children's Hospital says it's a mental problem.
[01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:35.213]  The parents should be able to choose between those two conflicting diagnoses.
[01:01:35.253 --> 01:01:39.596]  But instead, the child was removed from their custody by the government.
[01:01:40.376 --> 01:01:43.078]  And they had a gag order put on them by the judge.
[01:01:43.098 --> 01:01:50.483]  And when the father went to Glenn Beck and talked about it on Glenn Beck's program, he was slammed with a contempt of court charge.
[01:01:50.663 --> 01:01:56.187]  And then the mother just passed out recently as they've taken the children away from them and put them in foster care.
[01:01:56.527 --> 01:01:58.128]  This is where this is headed, isn't it, Paul?
[01:01:58.268 --> 01:01:58.435]  Yeah.
[01:01:59.375 --> 01:02:00.296]  It's chilling, David.
[01:02:00.336 --> 01:02:21.430]  I mean, the amount of emails I receive on a weekly basis, both to my private email and to InfoWars, from people merely expressing grief, shock and horror in, you know, five-page emails recounting the whole horror story about how the state has stolen their children, begging me to draw attention to it.
[01:02:21.850 --> 01:02:26.773]  And I can't even get through most of them because it's just so fundamentally disturbing.
[01:02:26.793 --> 01:02:28.935]  There's actually a program in the UK
[01:02:29.515 --> 01:02:29.715]  Yeah.
[01:02:45.268 --> 01:02:47.449]  Eight proper meals and attended school.
[01:02:47.789 --> 01:02:49.909]  So that's the level of invasiveness.
[01:02:49.969 --> 01:03:00.372]  Now it comes out that GCHQ, British spy agency working with the NSA, is, as we predicted years ago, watching our webcams, storing the images from them.
[01:03:00.712 --> 01:03:02.912]  It's completely invasive nanny state.
[01:03:03.292 --> 01:03:05.433]  And again, you know, how much will people put up with?
[01:03:05.473 --> 01:03:06.933]  Well, they'll put up with a lot.
[01:03:07.393 --> 01:03:10.934]  But once it comes to their wallets, that's maybe when it breaks.
[01:03:11.383 --> 01:03:13.505]  Maybe when it comes to their children is when it breaks.
[01:03:13.525 --> 01:03:21.930]  You know, they have maintained the document, the notion here in the U.S., the legal term for it is in loco parentis, which means in place of the parents.
[01:03:22.571 --> 01:03:32.318]  And courts have held over and over again that once you take your child to a government school, you'd have no right to complain about what they do in the school because you've essentially abandoned your child to the state in their eyes.
[01:03:33.038 --> 01:03:41.502]  The whole notion behind this, publicly, is that the government knows better and cares more for these children than the parents do.
[01:03:41.582 --> 01:03:45.963]  And of course, that is an absurd thing on the face of it that we ought to reject.
[01:03:46.063 --> 01:03:49.945]  But we need to understand that it is something far more sinister than that.
[01:03:50.025 --> 01:03:56.408]  This is something that attacks the very fundamental, the most fundamental institution in our society, is the family.
[01:03:57.248 --> 01:04:01.529]  And that was why Plato wanted to remove it so he could have a strong government.
[01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:07.890]  That's what he suggested in the Republic, that no one in an ideal Republic, according to Plato, would even know who their parents were.
[01:04:08.350 --> 01:04:10.811]  Their total allegiance would be to the state.
[01:04:10.851 --> 01:04:18.832]  And that's what we see the social engineers, the socialists of every stripe throughout generations have always sought to impose on a population.
[01:04:18.852 --> 01:04:22.993]  They've always seen the family, as well as God, as their competition.
[01:04:24.801 --> 01:04:25.202]  Exactly.
[01:04:25.222 --> 01:04:26.944]  It's a brave new world scenario.
[01:04:27.084 --> 01:04:35.554]  And of course, statistically, children are more likely to be abused when they're in, quote, government care per capita than in the general population.
[01:04:35.594 --> 01:04:39.179]  So their justification of protecting children is in fact the opposite.
[01:04:39.199 --> 01:04:41.562]  They're more likely to be abused in government care.
[01:04:41.842 --> 01:04:43.124]  Yes, we've seen that over and over again.
[01:04:43.684 --> 01:04:45.065]  Well, Paul, thank you for joining us.
[01:04:45.185 --> 01:04:46.086]  It's just amazing.
[01:04:46.106 --> 01:04:48.088]  We keep watching what happens in the Ukraine.
[01:04:48.148 --> 01:04:49.689]  We see the bankers doubling down.
[01:04:49.729 --> 01:04:54.813]  We see them fostering again a new Cold War so they can sell more military equipment.
[01:04:54.933 --> 01:04:56.034]  You know, they always benefit.
[01:04:56.154 --> 01:04:57.675]  They always profit from these wars.
[01:04:58.356 --> 01:05:01.198]  We're going to be joined right after the break with Jakari Jackson.
[01:05:01.238 --> 01:05:02.539]  And we're going to be taking your calls.
[01:05:02.599 --> 01:05:03.000]  Call us at 800-259-9231.
[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:03.240]  Stay tuned.
[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:03.820]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:10.097 --> 01:05:12.818]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:05:13.098 --> 01:05:17.941]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:05:18.121 --> 01:05:25.304]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:05:25.424 --> 01:05:30.847]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:05:31.067 --> 01:05:34.808]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

[01:07:09.614 --> 01:07:14.219]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:07:14.339 --> 01:07:17.321]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:07:17.462 --> 01:07:22.706]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:07:23.027 --> 01:07:24.688]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:07:24.969 --> 01:07:26.290]  We are what we eat.
[01:07:26.610 --> 01:07:28.512]  Our food is devoid of nutrition.
[01:07:28.732 --> 01:07:29.112]  I don't know.
[01:07:47.225 --> 01:07:54.127]  The site is literally packed with audio and video featuring top health professionals who don't bow down to Big Pharma.

[01:08:22.493 --> 01:08:26.338]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:26.898 --> 01:08:30.963]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:35.941]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:36.002 --> 01:08:37.503]  It's Thursday, February 27, 2014.
[01:08:37.903 --> 01:08:40.005]  I'm David Knight filling in for Alex.
[01:08:40.025 --> 01:08:43.168]  I'm going to join here in the studio with Jakari Jackson.
[01:08:43.188 --> 01:08:45.030]  We're going to be taking your calls in just a couple of minutes.
[01:08:45.931 --> 01:08:48.713]  You know, we had scheduled today Wolfgang Halbig.
[01:08:48.733 --> 01:08:49.834]  Now, he's an investigator.
[01:08:50.635 --> 01:08:54.836]  Who is a former state trooper, a former educator, he is a school security consultant.
[01:08:55.236 --> 01:08:58.857]  He started looking at Sandy Hook because that's his job.
[01:08:59.357 --> 01:09:05.059]  His job is to look at what happens when there's school violence and to advise people how to stop that.
[01:09:05.099 --> 01:09:12.461]  He's investigated Columbine, he's investigated many school shootings over and over again and yet when he tried to investigate Sandy Hook,
[01:09:13.061 --> 01:09:14.644]  What he found was very different.
[01:09:15.205 --> 01:09:21.057]  Not only was he totally stonewalled by the Connecticut police, but they actually threatened him.
[01:09:21.117 --> 01:09:24.624]  They had police in Florida come to his house twice at their request.
[01:09:25.467 --> 01:09:28.188]  And they called him and threatened him on the phone as well.
[01:09:28.708 --> 01:09:30.989]  And what he has found there is absolutely amazing.
[01:09:31.129 --> 01:09:33.990]  This came to our attention when the American Free Press had an interview with him.
[01:09:34.790 --> 01:09:37.011]  We had a Don Salazar do an article about it.
[01:09:37.071 --> 01:09:44.694]  We've interviewed him for the Nightly News and we really wanted to have him on today, but he called just a few minutes ago and said he's got a personal family emergency.
[01:09:45.754 --> 01:09:48.436]  Pray for Wolfgang, whatever is going on with his family.
[01:09:48.496 --> 01:09:51.058]  We hope to have him on again and talk about this soon.
[01:09:51.438 --> 01:09:55.882]  It's amazing to see that this is all collapsing in front of the government's eyes.
[01:09:55.922 --> 01:10:00.405]  These phony narratives about Sandy Hook, these phony narratives about the Boston bombing.
[01:10:00.445 --> 01:10:12.274]  In the last hour, we played clips from both CNN and Rachel Maddow on MSNBC, seriously questioning the events as they were reported, the official story about the Boston bombing.
[01:10:12.595 --> 01:10:14.996]  This is collapsing very quickly for them, and they see
[01:10:15.737 --> 01:10:18.819]  That the mainstream media no longer has any credibility.
[01:10:18.979 --> 01:10:27.466]  I kind of think that the way this is going to happen is that the Voice of America got the prohibition to broadcast.
[01:10:27.806 --> 01:10:30.548]  They were prohibited after they were created at the beginning of the Cold War.
[01:10:30.568 --> 01:10:34.851]  They were prohibited from broadcasting government propaganda into America.
[01:10:35.611 --> 01:10:38.093]  They broadcast American propaganda into Europe.
[01:10:38.153 --> 01:10:40.275]  They were prohibited from doing that here domestically.
[01:10:41.229 --> 01:10:54.337]  Now that prohibition has been lifted, I think what's going to happen is they're going to try to reposition much of the mainstream media as alternative media, questioning to some degree in a limited way what the government's narrative is.
[01:10:54.398 --> 01:10:59.461]  I think that's perhaps maybe what's behind MSNBC and Rachel Maddow, or maybe they're just seeing the
[01:11:00.061 --> 01:11:02.003]  The collapse of Piers Morgan, but whatever.
[01:11:02.223 --> 01:11:12.972]  We welcome the fact that they're asking questions about the murder of Ibrahim Todeshev, who was, they said they were picking him up for questioning, and then they shot him six times, once in the back of the head.
[01:11:12.992 --> 01:11:16.895]  That's clearly a murder, clearly an assassination at the hands of the FBI.
[01:11:17.515 --> 01:11:18.616]  And who investigates the FBI?
[01:11:19.457 --> 01:11:21.878]  Well, that would be the FBI itself, I guess.
[01:11:22.418 --> 01:11:26.059]  And Jakari, we just had Chief Acevedo in here yesterday.
[01:11:26.099 --> 01:11:37.902]  We were questioning him about some of the things that have recently happened that the police have done here in Austin that we think are way over the top in terms of this jogger incident that he had to apologize for last week.
[01:11:38.763 --> 01:11:43.164]  And you did a special report where you went out on the street and you talked to people about that.
[01:11:43.544 --> 01:11:46.345]  Yes, that was one of the big deals from the beginning was
[01:11:47.525 --> 01:11:58.050]  To the people who aren't familiar with the story, the Austin Police Department for the last couple weeks have been cracking down on various traffic infractions, and last week they were studying jaywalking.
[01:11:58.110 --> 01:12:06.975]  So their intention was to go out and sign citations to jaywalkers, but they encountered one young lady who did not want to stop for them, you know, so they claim.
[01:12:07.555 --> 01:12:08.356]  We're good to go.
[01:12:29.554 --> 01:12:33.337]  If she was grabbed from behind or not, because she knew it was an officer approaching her.
[01:12:33.377 --> 01:12:34.398]  So we did a man on the street.
[01:12:34.438 --> 01:12:40.463]  I went out to the streets and I asked young ladies, I said, you know, how would you react if somebody ran up from you, ran up on you from behind?
[01:12:40.483 --> 01:12:44.586]  And I even ran up on some people in the streets and I just ran up behind them.
[01:12:44.606 --> 01:12:46.968]  Like, how do you feel about somebody coming up on you from behind?
[01:12:47.388 --> 01:12:52.372]  And of course, you know, the young ladies who would stop and talk to him, they said, well, you know, I don't care who it is.
[01:12:52.432 --> 01:12:58.577]  If it's a police officer, if it's just some guy on the street, if somebody grabbed me from behind or out of my field of view, I'm either going to jerk away or fight back.
[01:12:58.877 --> 01:12:59.017]  Yeah.
[01:12:59.658 --> 01:13:07.144]  I mean, I really have a problem with this whole notion that because they're wearing a uniform, they can do things that are really unacceptable.
[01:13:07.204 --> 01:13:12.969]  In other words, they have some authority by nature of their uniform, but there needs to be some limits on the police.
[01:13:13.369 --> 01:13:16.612]  And we don't see those limits being enforced when they step over the line.
[01:13:17.293 --> 01:13:18.734]  I understand what Acevedo is saying.
[01:13:18.774 --> 01:13:22.297]  He says, you know, don't run from the police and you won't get shot in the back.
[01:13:22.697 --> 01:13:23.017]  Okay.
[01:13:23.057 --> 01:13:23.778]  That's pretty much it.
[01:13:23.798 --> 01:13:27.559]  Do whatever they tell you to do and you can always take it to court.
[01:13:27.619 --> 01:13:34.483]  But the problem is... And he told, I believe it was an interview with Alex he did a while back, he was talking about how you shouldn't run from the police for any reason.
[01:13:34.663 --> 01:13:34.843]  Yeah.
[01:13:35.103 --> 01:13:40.305]  You know, regardless of how ridiculous the circumstances may be, how unjustified, he says, do not run from the police.
[01:13:40.626 --> 01:13:44.167]  And in the city of Austin, we know that you can be shot in the back if you do run from the police.
[01:13:44.187 --> 01:13:44.547]  That's right.
[01:13:45.488 --> 01:13:47.869]  And see, the problem is, is that they get away with it.
[01:13:48.089 --> 01:13:48.329]  Yes.
[01:13:48.789 --> 01:13:50.870]  And it's not just one isolated incident.
[01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:56.231]  You know, you can look at one case and you can say, all right, well, maybe that's not as it appears to be.
[01:13:56.291 --> 01:14:08.613]  But when it happens over and over and over and over again in every jurisdiction, the American public is starting to come to the idea that there is nothing that a cop can do that they will ever stand trial for or ever be rolled back.
[01:14:08.633 --> 01:14:13.694]  So this whole idea that you do whatever the cop says, and then if you have a problem with it, you can take it to court.
[01:14:14.074 --> 01:14:14.834]  That ain't washing.
[01:14:15.174 --> 01:14:16.055]  I don't see that happening.
[01:14:36.488 --> 01:14:39.870]  Regardless, he flees the bank because he doesn't want to be involved with the police.
[01:14:40.330 --> 01:14:49.916]  The officer commandeers a car to track him down and after a supposed struggle, Larry Jackson is unfortunately shot in the back and dies.
[01:14:50.356 --> 01:14:56.620]  Now, the officer wasn't under investigation until he retired and then APD just dropped investigation.
[01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:05.624]  So which is to say, if you commit a crime where you kill somebody, if you just retire, you don't want to fight it, you say, hey, I'm done with it, then the investigation is dropped.
[01:15:05.804 --> 01:15:06.565]  That's just amazing.
[01:15:07.045 --> 01:15:11.327]  And to point it out too, the guy who ran was a black guy.
[01:15:11.387 --> 01:15:14.548]  The bank robbery suspect was a white guy.
[01:15:14.568 --> 01:15:15.909]  He didn't match the description.
[01:15:16.329 --> 01:15:19.471]  It's just kind of like this Chris Dorner case out in L.A.
[01:15:19.491 --> 01:15:22.112]  where they're looking for a black man and they shoot up
[01:15:22.552 --> 01:15:27.476]  A car with two white women, totally different cars, a car not a truck, different color, the whole bit.
[01:15:27.556 --> 01:15:30.478]  I mean it's just amazing and yet they get away with it.
[01:15:30.578 --> 01:15:30.879]  Why?
[01:15:30.999 --> 01:15:33.901]  Because we've got a legal system that is fundamentally broken.
[01:15:33.921 --> 01:15:35.863]  That's why I don't support the death penalty.
[01:15:36.223 --> 01:15:38.365]  I support the death penalty in principle.
[01:15:38.925 --> 01:15:44.667]  But I don't support it in practice because I don't believe that people are getting a fair and honest trial.
[01:15:44.747 --> 01:15:59.492]  I don't believe that the juries, most importantly, the juries do not see themselves as independent of the judge's instructions as somebody who's going to sit there and and look at the facts and and see that their job is justice to judge the law as well as the facts of the case.
[01:15:59.792 --> 01:16:02.613]  And you have so, in the case of some of these police
[01:16:04.033 --> 01:16:06.015]  Cases where they're not found guilty.
[01:16:06.676 --> 01:16:10.279]  The judges can manipulate that system by withholding evidence.
[01:16:10.479 --> 01:16:15.724]  I mean, they have so much leeway and we don't have an independent jury system.
[01:16:15.744 --> 01:16:17.125]  It's a broken system.
[01:16:17.145 --> 01:16:18.667]  But let's take a look at your report here.
[01:16:19.728 --> 01:16:20.749]  Can we go to that report, guys?
[01:16:22.341 --> 01:16:23.561]  We don't have that ready just yet.
[01:16:23.961 --> 01:16:30.343]  We're here at the spot where last week four Austin police officers were needed to subdue a single female jogger.
[01:16:30.643 --> 01:16:32.663]  The original offense, jaywalking.
[01:16:32.963 --> 01:16:36.444]  She was later on arrested for the failure to identify to an officer.
[01:16:36.764 --> 01:16:38.944]  What happened to the Miranda right to remain silent?
[01:16:38.984 --> 01:16:40.165]  What happened to the Fifth Amendment?
[01:16:40.185 --> 01:16:41.425]  What happened to the First Amendment?
[01:16:41.745 --> 01:16:42.585]  The freedom of speech.
[01:16:42.665 --> 01:16:44.666]  Does that also include the freedom not to speak?
[01:16:44.906 --> 01:16:46.366]  Let's find out what these students have to say.
[01:16:46.386 --> 01:16:47.486]  Hi, excuse me.
[01:16:47.506 --> 01:16:47.546]  Hi.
[01:16:47.646 --> 01:16:51.307]  What do you think about the jogger who got arrested out here last week?
[01:16:51.937 --> 01:16:55.880]  I actually think it's kind of funny because I cross the street all the time.
[01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:58.262]  What do you think about the jaywalker who was arrested last week?
[01:16:59.743 --> 01:17:00.704]  I don't know the whole story, do you?
[01:17:01.385 --> 01:17:04.307]  I don't know the whole story, but with what you heard, do you have any opinion?
[01:17:04.407 --> 01:17:08.571]  Because they say, well she was officially arrested for failing to identify to an officer.
[01:17:08.591 --> 01:17:10.092]  It wasn't the jaywalking charge.
[01:17:10.492 --> 01:17:16.477]  But just the police resources, do you think it's a good use of a police resource to be out here busting jaywalkers?
[01:17:16.517 --> 01:17:17.658]  Just cracking down on jaywalking?
[01:17:18.706 --> 01:17:19.006]  I don't know.
[01:17:19.026 --> 01:17:21.507]  That's sort of like, you know, do you still beat your wife, right?
[01:17:21.947 --> 01:17:23.248]  You can't really beat your wife.
[01:17:23.268 --> 01:17:26.429]  You can't say whether you did or not because you'd be guilty either way.
[01:17:26.889 --> 01:17:30.490]  I don't necessarily agree with his comparison to beating your wife.
[01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:33.251]  I mean, busting a jaywalker is busting a jaywalker.
[01:17:33.831 --> 01:17:41.354]  My thoughts are that's pretty ridiculous, but it was a white girl in a nice part of town, and if it was anybody else, it wouldn't have made the news.
[01:17:41.694 --> 01:17:44.415]  If somebody gets hit from jaywalking, then that's their problem.
[01:17:44.435 --> 01:17:46.056]  You don't need four cops involved.
[01:17:46.844 --> 01:17:49.465]  Um, I think he shouldn't have got arrested or she shouldn't have got arrested.
[01:17:50.046 --> 01:17:50.486]  Why is that?
[01:17:50.506 --> 01:17:52.227]  Because she was just crossing the street.
[01:17:52.607 --> 01:17:52.787]  Right.
[01:17:53.387 --> 01:17:57.389]  Well, you know, the official reason given for her arrest wasn't so much that she crossed the street.
[01:17:57.730 --> 01:18:00.031]  It was because she failed to identify to an officer.
[01:18:00.911 --> 01:18:02.452]  So that means she didn't show her ID?
[01:18:02.472 --> 01:18:07.775]  Is that the... Well, she didn't provide the Austin Police Department with as much information as they desired.
[01:18:07.955 --> 01:18:09.956]  I mean, are you familiar with your Miranda rights?
[01:18:10.447 --> 01:18:11.689]  Yes, I am familiar.
[01:18:11.709 --> 01:18:14.613]  Can you tell me one of the Miranda rights?
[01:18:15.334 --> 01:18:17.838]  You have a right to remain silent.
[01:18:18.407 --> 01:18:19.748]  There have been contradictory reports.
[01:18:19.768 --> 01:18:23.811]  The police are saying that they were in the young lady's field of view when they tried to grab her.
[01:18:23.831 --> 01:18:27.094]  There have been other reports saying that the officers approached her from behind.
[01:18:27.494 --> 01:18:30.737]  Quintero doesn't think the officer did run up beside her, like Acevedo said.
[01:18:31.197 --> 01:18:38.964]  I think he grabbed her slightly from behind, and it may not be from far behind, but enough to where she didn't notice who was grabbing her right away.
[01:18:39.164 --> 01:18:45.229]  So, if you were out jogging, you got your headphones in, you're a single woman alone, and somebody just grabbed you from behind, what would your reaction be?
[01:18:45.655 --> 01:18:46.515]  I would have kept running.
[01:18:46.935 --> 01:18:51.816]  Um, all I heard I read was that she didn't see them coming and they grabbed her from behind.
[01:18:51.836 --> 01:18:55.777]  Whether or not he grabbed her by behind, it doesn't, it's not relevant.
[01:18:56.678 --> 01:18:58.578]  At some point, she knows it's a cop.
[01:18:59.018 --> 01:19:02.899]  If somebody was to grab you from behind for any reason, what would your reaction be?
[01:19:02.919 --> 01:19:07.380]  Um, definitely do exactly what she did, you know, kick their ass.
[01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:10.681]  Uh, excuse me miss, you were jaywalking there for a second.
[01:19:12.968 --> 01:19:15.970]  Okay, so she has to go to class and that's a good reason to jaywalk.
[01:19:16.410 --> 01:19:18.511]  I just want you to know you get arrested by the Austin Police Department.
[01:19:18.852 --> 01:19:21.253]  Let me ask you about some comments that the police chief made.
[01:19:21.773 --> 01:19:28.338]  He said that, you know, the big controversy of last week was that a jogger was arrested, you know, for failing to identify.
[01:19:28.378 --> 01:19:33.081]  He says, in comparison, in other cities you have officers who are actually sexually assaulting people.
[01:19:33.421 --> 01:19:35.982]  So does that concern you at all that the bars have been set kind of low?
[01:19:36.002 --> 01:19:39.965]  He later came back and, you know, took back those comments, but do you think that's
[01:19:40.265 --> 01:19:41.326]  A good place to set the bar?
[01:19:41.787 --> 01:19:44.169]  No, this has nothing to do with sexual assault.
[01:19:44.189 --> 01:19:45.050]  You can't compare that.
[01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:49.754]  Now he has later come back and rescinded those comments, but do you think that's kind of a bad place to set your bar?
[01:19:49.774 --> 01:19:50.735]  That's a great report.
[01:19:50.775 --> 01:19:52.097]  We're out of time on this segment.
[01:19:52.137 --> 01:19:54.979]  We're going to be right back and we're going to talk a little bit more about that.
[01:19:54.999 --> 01:19:58.283]  We're also going to take your calls about what we were talking about earlier about the family.
[01:19:58.303 --> 01:20:03.908]  If you've got calls about Ukraine or anything, we'll be taking those calls right after the break with Jakari Jackson.
[01:20:03.928 --> 01:20:04.569]  We'll be right back.

[01:23:08.687 --> 01:23:11.268]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:23:11.508 --> 01:23:16.390]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at My Patriot Supply.
[01:23:16.650 --> 01:23:24.473]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:23:24.753 --> 01:23:29.078]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:23:29.298 --> 01:23:33.123]  By Patriots Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:23:33.263 --> 01:23:38.989]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:23:39.230 --> 01:23:39.650]  It is rare to
[01:23:39.650 --> 01:23:39.870]  We're good.
[01:24:23.511 --> 01:24:23.994]  I got it.
[01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:27.101]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:27.161 --> 01:24:27.741]  I'm David Knight.
[01:24:27.781 --> 01:24:30.162]  I'm joined here in studio with Jakari Jackson.
[01:24:30.202 --> 01:24:31.723]  We're filling in for Alex Jones today.
[01:24:31.743 --> 01:24:33.564]  There's a lot of breaking news today.
[01:24:33.584 --> 01:24:41.048]  You know, we see that yet another sailor has come forward talking about how his exposure at Fukushima has ruined his health.
[01:24:41.148 --> 01:24:46.291]  It's now up to 100 sailors here and there.
[01:24:46.891 --> 01:24:49.112]  They said that they didn't know.
[01:24:49.132 --> 01:24:50.633]  This is what CBS said.
[01:24:50.653 --> 01:24:53.635]  They didn't know that they were heading into the path of a radiation plume.
[01:24:53.835 --> 01:24:54.055]  Really?
[01:24:54.764 --> 01:24:56.205]  I don't know, I think somebody knew about that.
[01:24:56.585 --> 01:25:03.850]  They said now three years after the exposure, at least 100 of those first responders are suffering from unexplained illnesses like cancer, leukemia, bleeding and hair loss.
[01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:06.532]  We had one of those sailors on the program.
[01:25:06.572 --> 01:25:07.673]  Alex talked to him at length.
[01:25:08.293 --> 01:25:10.535]  A very sad situation, but we've seen over and over again.
[01:25:11.355 --> 01:25:20.601]  A total disregard, whether it's depleted uranium, whether it's Agent Orange, the government doesn't treat soldiers with the respect that they should have for them.
[01:25:21.182 --> 01:25:30.328]  In many cases they treat them worse than they do chimpanzees because they've even said in some cases that they're cheaper than chimpanzees.
[01:25:31.108 --> 01:25:33.350]  Also, Google fears that the FCC's
[01:25:34.432 --> 01:25:36.873]  New internet powers are going to affect even Google.
[01:25:37.673 --> 01:25:41.915]  We've just seen just the last week how the FCC was going to intrude itself into newsrooms.
[01:25:42.055 --> 01:25:43.135]  Everybody was concerned about that.
[01:25:43.175 --> 01:25:45.956]  They said, content is none of your business.
[01:25:45.996 --> 01:25:48.737]  But the FCC is making it their business.
[01:25:49.158 --> 01:25:55.160]  And now the fears are that they're going to do a backdoor content management on the internet
[01:25:56.292 --> 01:26:00.094]  Using the same kind of justification that they were trying to get with SOPA.
[01:26:00.114 --> 01:26:04.217]  We've had SOPA, we've had PIPA, we've had CISPA rejected twice.
[01:26:04.817 --> 01:26:08.479]  Now it looks like they're going to try to just do it with the FCC.
[01:26:08.499 --> 01:26:09.580]  You know, that's kind of jacquard.
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:12.342]  It's kind of like Obama has done this in the past, hasn't he?
[01:26:12.362 --> 01:26:16.924]  You know, he's always come in and just said, well, this is the year of action.
[01:26:17.024 --> 01:26:19.126]  We're just going to go around Congress.
[01:26:19.186 --> 01:26:23.148]  If we can't get internet censorship, internet control passed by Congress, I'm sure we can
[01:26:23.208 --> 01:26:24.149]  Just do the FCC.
[01:26:24.229 --> 01:26:24.769]  Gun stuff?
[01:26:24.929 --> 01:26:25.810]  Oh yeah, whatever.
[01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:31.053]  If I can't get Congress to sign on, I'm just gonna, I got my pen, I got my telephone, that's how I'm going to do it.
[01:26:31.233 --> 01:26:31.614]  That's right.
[01:26:31.954 --> 01:26:38.458]  We've also got, the FBI says that they had human source contact with Bin Laden as far back as 1993.
[01:26:38.638 --> 01:26:41.220]  This is an exclusive from the Washington Times.
[01:26:41.901 --> 01:26:43.482]  But you know, this is not a surprise.
[01:26:43.522 --> 01:26:45.943]  This is something that Cybele Edmonds blew the whistle on.
[01:26:45.963 --> 01:26:49.566]  She tried to get the 9-11 Commission to pay attention to this, and of course they gagged her.
[01:26:50.767 --> 01:27:01.098]  That's how she got the title of the most censored woman in history, a whistleblower, who was at the FBI and she knew that they were in contact with Bin Laden leading up to 9-11.
[01:27:01.579 --> 01:27:06.945]  We've said over and over again that Bin Laden was deeply tied, deeply tied to the CIA.
[01:27:06.985 --> 01:27:07.525]  He was their guy.
[01:27:08.226 --> 01:27:08.366]  Just
[01:27:26.129 --> 01:27:33.976]  Performed by farmers for millennia, using natural organic fertilizer, using animals to plow a field.
[01:27:34.056 --> 01:27:34.797]  No, you can't do that.
[01:27:34.837 --> 01:27:39.781]  You've got to buy your fertilizer from the pharmaceutical companies and Big Agra.
[01:27:40.402 --> 01:27:47.048]  So we're going to be taking your calls on that, but before we do, I want to tell you that this hour is brought to you by My Patriot Supply.
[01:27:47.588 --> 01:27:54.713]  You know, we're seeing attacks on our freedoms like never before, but we can secure our independence by breaking free from the confines of their systems of control.
[01:27:55.094 --> 01:27:59.337]  The path to liberty starts with attaining a level of self-reliance.
[01:27:59.377 --> 01:28:06.762]  And my Patriot Supply is the home of a wide array of survival products, including the Patriot Pantry line of emergency food storage products.

[01:28:33.561 --> 01:28:34.381]  We're listener supported.
[01:28:34.442 --> 01:28:40.486]  We appreciate if you patronize those people who support us.
[01:28:41.291 --> 01:28:41.891]  We're good to go.
[01:29:01.059 --> 01:29:01.920]  We're good to go!
[01:29:30.979 --> 01:29:31.339]  That's right.
[01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:34.802]  And just earlier this week I talked to Mark Baker of Baker's Green Acres.
[01:29:35.242 --> 01:29:42.728]  He's a farmer in Michigan and the pig association there is basically coming after the farmers who are raising heritage pigs.
[01:29:42.768 --> 01:29:43.809]  They're saying that they're feral.
[01:29:44.349 --> 01:29:47.151]  He's been fighting that on his own for almost three years now.
[01:29:47.572 --> 01:29:50.674]  We're gonna be right back after the break and we're gonna take your phone calls.
[01:29:51.254 --> 01:29:52.055]  Tell us what you think.
[01:29:52.635 --> 01:29:56.638]  Whether it's the Ukraine or the FDA cracking down on our food supply.
[01:29:56.678 --> 01:29:57.419]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:57.439 --> 01:29:57.939]  Stay tuned.
[01:29:59.272 --> 01:30:02.258]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:05.885]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.003 --> 01:30:12.565]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:30:12.825 --> 01:30:17.709]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:30:17.969 --> 01:30:25.835]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:30:26.076 --> 01:30:30.399]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:30:30.619 --> 01:30:34.422]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:30:34.562 --> 01:30:40.286]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:30:40.526 --> 01:30:43.308]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:30:43.688 --> 01:30:48.912]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:30:49.072 --> 01:30:57.197]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[01:30:57.217 --> 01:30:57.417]  That's 866-229-0927.
[01:31:04.522 --> 01:31:13.126]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[01:31:13.226 --> 01:31:15.467]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[01:31:15.667 --> 01:31:23.951]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[01:31:24.251 --> 01:31:32.215]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic
[01:31:32.415 --> 01:31:40.367]  A super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:31:40.567 --> 01:31:48.219]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:31:48.619 --> 01:31:54.704]  Supermail Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:31:54.944 --> 01:32:03.570]  For a limited time, we are offering 15% off Supermail Vitality at InfoWarsLife.com to introduce you to this powerful supplement.

[01:32:09.795 --> 01:32:20.205]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:32:20.485 --> 01:32:22.346]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:32:22.547 --> 01:32:23.247]  Fluoride!
[01:32:23.447 --> 01:32:25.009]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:32:25.369 --> 01:32:31.675]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:32:31.915 --> 01:32:36.720]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:42.926]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:32:43.166 --> 01:32:45.348]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:32:45.588 --> 01:32:48.231]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:32:48.531 --> 01:32:51.914]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:32:52.014 --> 01:32:56.596]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:32:57.457 --> 01:33:02.259]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[01:33:02.559 --> 01:33:03.599]  I take it every day.
[01:33:03.739 --> 01:33:06.601]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:21.363]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:21.844 --> 01:33:25.968]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:28.851 --> 01:33:30.153]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:30.233 --> 01:33:31.454]  I'm David Knight filling in for Alex.
[01:33:31.494 --> 01:33:33.476]  I'm joined here in the studio with Jakari Jackson.
[01:33:34.097 --> 01:33:36.840]  And we've been talking about a wide variety of topics.
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:39.542]  Last hour I talked to Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[01:33:40.675 --> 01:33:50.862]  We talked about how they just passed a law in Scotland that would assign a government minder to every child from birth until the age of 18.
[01:33:52.423 --> 01:33:54.724]  And that is absolutely amazing.
[01:33:55.165 --> 01:33:58.307]  And we can't say that that would never happen here, can we, Jakari?
[01:33:58.347 --> 01:34:01.189]  Because we've just seen this case where you've got a Connecticut teenager
[01:34:02.065 --> 01:34:12.214]  Who goes to Massachusetts to get treatment, and you've got one hospital that says it's a physical condition, another one says it's a psychiatric condition, and the parents don't have any say-so in this.
[01:34:12.614 --> 01:34:23.885]  They believe, they agree with the diagnosis that it's a physical condition, and they see their daughter getting constantly worse, wasting away, but the court, the Massachusetts court steps in and says,
[01:34:24.505 --> 01:34:25.306]  Can't do anything about it.
[01:34:25.366 --> 01:34:28.268]  We're not even going to let you talk to the media about it.
[01:34:28.728 --> 01:34:33.432]  And they put a contempt order on the father when he goes and talks to Glenn Beck about it.
[01:34:33.492 --> 01:34:34.813]  It's just outrageous.
[01:34:34.833 --> 01:34:36.594]  And now they put their daughter in foster care.
[01:34:36.634 --> 01:34:36.975]  Exactly.
[01:34:36.995 --> 01:34:43.880]  Because you see even stories where they try to take your children away or put some kind of sanction on you if you refuse to vaccinate your children.
[01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:50.565]  I've read before I vaccinated and I've choose to not vaccinate my child and now they want to take your children away.
[01:34:50.765 --> 01:34:51.485]  Yes, that's right.
[01:34:51.885 --> 01:35:01.369]  Coming against the family, and as we just talked about in the last segment, coming against the family farm, we've had, first we had Obama's Labor Department say about a year ago, wasn't it?
[01:35:01.389 --> 01:35:06.772]  They said that they were going to start taking a close look at child labor laws and how they apply it on the farm, right?
[01:35:06.792 --> 01:35:10.033]  You're not going to be able to work on the farm, you know, I have a family of
[01:35:10.773 --> 01:35:18.438]  Farmers you know some old-time Oklahoma country folks, and you know they were you know Obama supporters And I said you know Obama doesn't want kids to work in the farm.
[01:35:18.458 --> 01:35:20.660]  They just couldn't believe it It's like why would he do that?
[01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:22.601]  I said because he can yeah exactly.
[01:35:22.701 --> 01:35:23.802]  It's absolutely insane.
[01:35:24.442 --> 01:35:35.450]  I just talked earlier this week There's an interview on the nightly news and of course Jakari is on the night is a host and a reporter on the nightly news It's something you guys need to support prison planet TV.
[01:35:35.470 --> 01:35:39.933]  I'll put a little plug in there for word listener supported It's a subscription service just one
[01:35:40.933 --> 01:35:48.658]  Subscription will let you share that with 10 people simultaneously so it's a it's a great way to see our documentaries to see our news reports first but I had
[01:35:49.716 --> 01:35:55.181]  Mark Baker, Baker's Green Acres, he's a farmer in Michigan, and he's raising heritage pigs.
[01:35:55.541 --> 01:36:10.815]  He's letting, it's like free-range cattle, it's like, you know, grass-fed cattle, free-range chickens, that's what he's doing with his pigs, and he's got a strain of heritage pigs that, since he lives in Michigan, they've got hair on them, and based on the physical appearance
[01:36:11.075 --> 01:36:11.335]  That's right.
[01:36:34.628 --> 01:36:42.856]  He said that he got into farming because when he was in the military, the most grounded, most centered people that he met had been raised on a farm.
[01:36:43.376 --> 01:36:45.618]  And he wanted that life for his family.
[01:36:45.978 --> 01:36:48.501]  And he wanted to, you know, so that's why he got into farming.
[01:36:48.781 --> 01:37:00.552]  You've got family farmers who are not producing the kind of factory food that we're concerned about, that's got a lot of pesticides, a lot of steroids, a lot of antibiotics in it.
[01:37:01.598 --> 01:37:07.223]  You've got good, clean, honest food, and the government is coming down on them from every direction like a hammer.
[01:37:07.284 --> 01:37:12.809]  I mean, it was the child labor laws and the EPA, from the Labor Department, it's the EPA came after them with dust regulations.
[01:37:12.869 --> 01:37:16.673]  Now we've got the FDA coming out and saying they can't have natural fertilizer.
[01:37:16.853 --> 01:37:21.898]  And then even during some drought periods, we have seen cows and other livestock eating candy.
[01:37:22.418 --> 01:37:22.598]  Yeah.
[01:37:23.318 --> 01:37:25.119]  It's all kinds of wacky things.
[01:37:25.299 --> 01:37:31.222]  But you know, they want to have the entire food supply controlled by just a few people who are their friends.
[01:37:31.462 --> 01:37:35.284]  Both for monetary purposes, but it's also a very effective political means.
[01:37:35.764 --> 01:37:37.845]  Now we've had a couple of callers who have been waiting for a while.
[01:37:37.885 --> 01:37:40.546]  Let's go to them and give them a chance to weigh in on this.
[01:37:40.926 --> 01:37:41.886]  We were talking about the family.
[01:37:41.926 --> 01:37:44.247]  We got a first call from Bob in Michigan.
[01:37:44.287 --> 01:37:45.408]  He wanted to talk about the family.
[01:37:45.448 --> 01:37:45.648]  Bob?
[01:37:46.681 --> 01:37:49.403]  Thanks for taking my call and joining your show today, guys.
[01:37:49.423 --> 01:37:51.264]  Sounds really great.
[01:37:52.645 --> 01:38:11.356]  You've had other people call in and talk about the relationship of the political structure and how it enslaves people, but people keep saying, well, how can they do that with the children, impose a gag order, tell them what medical care they'll get?
[01:38:11.596 --> 01:38:12.977]  I can't state this enough,
[01:38:13.487 --> 01:38:34.114]  You've had some other people that have really articulated it very well as to why, but you have to remember that the people that are in power see us as chattel goods, possessions, slaves if you will, and whatever is good for that property, they are maintaining that as a corporate asset.
[01:38:34.434 --> 01:38:34.554]  Yes.
[01:38:35.988 --> 01:38:38.609]  I mean, that's the common thread through this whole thing.
[01:38:39.089 --> 01:38:44.111]  And you know, the great late George Carlin said it, they own you.
[01:38:44.131 --> 01:38:50.373]  Exactly, because they own you with your student loan debt, they own you with your mortgage, they own you any kind of way they can.
[01:38:53.221 --> 01:38:54.663]  And that's what this is.
[01:38:55.805 --> 01:39:06.859]  We're talking about the result of a basic misclassification, criminally I might say, and put us all into that really risky, dangerous place.
[01:39:07.421 --> 01:39:10.623]  Yes, and you know, that's a mindset that people need to understand.
[01:39:10.643 --> 01:39:22.772]  They need to understand that this is not coming about because the government is fundamentally incompetent, or they waste money, or they really want to do the right thing, but no, they're basically, they have a very evil agenda.
[01:39:22.792 --> 01:39:24.133]  That's why we keep trying to put this out.
[01:39:24.153 --> 01:39:28.476]  We see this over and over again, and topic after topic, it isn't
[01:39:29.196 --> 01:39:31.998]  Incompetence, it isn't, mistakes being made.
[01:39:32.118 --> 01:39:38.882]  They always try to play that off, just like, you know, you have the situations of Benghazi, you have the situations of the ATF running guns into Mexico.
[01:39:38.902 --> 01:39:43.304]  And they say, oh, it was a few rogue agents, even though Eric Holder has perjured himself.
[01:39:43.344 --> 01:39:47.747]  He knew about it, he may have known about it under another name, but he knew these activities were going on.
[01:39:47.787 --> 01:39:49.728]  But they always try to plead incompetence.
[01:39:49.768 --> 01:39:51.809]  I have too many moving parts in my government.
[01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:55.632]  Well, why don't you shut down those moving parts when you find out they're acting the way they're not supposed to?
[01:39:55.732 --> 01:39:55.892]  Yes.
[01:39:56.132 --> 01:39:56.312]  Yeah.
[01:39:56.572 --> 01:40:00.595]  Fast and Furious, for example, the good example that you bring up there, that was not incompetence.
[01:40:00.615 --> 01:40:04.357]  That was a deliberate effort to destroy the Second Amendment.
[01:40:04.737 --> 01:40:14.763]  It was to manufacture a false flag so they could enact gun control and gun registration so they could prevent gun traveling over the border.
[01:40:15.063 --> 01:40:27.935]  No, they still, even though that Fast and Furious incident was exposed, they still try to use it because Obama goes down to Mexico and he says, the reason why you guys have such a high murder rate with your weapons is because we have a First Amendment in our country.
[01:40:28.035 --> 01:40:28.595]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:29.016 --> 01:40:30.657]  So, I mean, even the New York- Second Amendment, Second Amendment.
[01:40:30.857 --> 01:40:34.581]  Even the New York Times pointed out that it was a false flag in order to do that.
[01:40:34.641 --> 01:40:39.145]  And they had the UN Armed Trade Treaty, which was going to do precisely that.
[01:40:39.185 --> 01:40:48.314]  So they have something in mind that they want to enact, and so they create a false flag that's going to move public opinion just in time for the event to come in.
[01:40:49.014 --> 01:40:54.517]  Fortunately, blew up in their face and was exposed only because a federal agent was killed.
[01:40:54.858 --> 01:40:57.679]  Let's go to, thank you Bob, for the call about the family.
[01:40:57.699 --> 01:40:58.920]  Let's go to D.C.
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:00.001]  and West Virginia.
[01:41:00.061 --> 01:41:02.942]  D.C., you said you got a Washington Times article you want to talk about?
[01:41:03.803 --> 01:41:04.663]  Hey, what's going on guys?
[01:41:04.703 --> 01:41:06.144]  Great job, like always.
[01:41:06.204 --> 01:41:12.588]  Sorry if I'm a little off topic, but I want to talk about the Banker Suicide, also known as murder.
[01:41:13.048 --> 01:41:17.431]  And I wanted to see if you all see any connection between this Washington Times
[01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.611]  We're good to go.
[01:41:39.690 --> 01:41:40.931]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:41:43.212 --> 01:41:45.234]  You have so many different predictions.
[01:41:45.614 --> 01:41:56.000]  I'm not the greatest forecaster, but I definitely do recognize the bankers' suicides or quote suicides, very mysterious circumstances going on with that, and it definitely does concern me.
[01:41:56.421 --> 01:42:02.705]  When you've got somebody who's a former chair of the Fed like Paul Volcker, if they predict a date, I mean certainly...
[01:42:03.661 --> 01:42:08.086]  They could manipulate the markets to the extent that they could precipitate a crash.
[01:42:08.347 --> 01:42:10.149]  We have the Federal Reserve because you had J.P.
[01:42:10.189 --> 01:42:15.014]  Morgan facilitate a crash and use that as an excuse to create the Federal Reserve.
[01:42:15.715 --> 01:42:16.196]  Thank you, D.C.
[01:42:16.236 --> 01:42:18.138]  Let's go to John in Ohio.
[01:42:18.699 --> 01:42:19.680]  You want to talk about the Ukraine?
[01:42:20.630 --> 01:42:30.034]  Yeah, I wanted to first point out that the media that everyone considers their friend in their car in their living room is really a cobra.
[01:42:30.634 --> 01:42:31.575]  It's not your friend.
[01:42:31.675 --> 01:42:40.979]  It's run by the Central Intelligence Agency, the biggest banks that own it or lock with it, the Fortune 100 companies, the war-mongering military industrial war profiteers.
[01:42:41.359 --> 01:42:45.961]  And that was even more confirmed with the FCC regulations that have been revealed recently.
[01:42:47.811 --> 01:42:57.132]  I'm not detailed on that, but that general statement I just made, I think, necessitates we get real alternatives, and I found one, which is global research.
[01:42:57.725 --> 01:43:10.974]  It's a collection of a lot of writers and journalists who will never get on CNN and Fox, and they've been talking about the lies we're being told on global research concerning, well, just about everywhere, including the Ukraine.
[01:43:11.454 --> 01:43:17.859]  And I wanted to bring up some of the incestuous relationships between
[01:43:19.175 --> 01:43:33.642]  Victoria Nuland, this notorious Imperialist, her husband is the neocon founder of the Hitlerian project for a new American century, Robert Kagan.
[01:43:34.142 --> 01:43:45.408]  And he also interlocks with the Republican warmongers because he is the top advisor to Mitt Romney, an even worse warmonger than Obama, which is hard to imagine.
[01:43:46.008 --> 01:43:48.129]  And so you see that there, and you see that
[01:43:48.962 --> 01:44:02.333]  This project for a new American century, I think a lot of people know, was the scheme of the top military industrial types and Democrats and Republicans to overthrow the entire world and establish U.S.
[01:44:03.574 --> 01:44:04.555]  world domination.
[01:44:04.915 --> 01:44:13.803]  They said because of the demise of the Soviet Union this was a golden opportunity, that they were going to eliminate and destroy any country that stood in the way of U.S.
[01:44:13.963 --> 01:44:16.085]  imperialist world domination.
[01:44:16.565 --> 01:44:41.246]  And you look at Samantha Power, the other warmonger, she is the wife of Cass Sunstein, who is the evil demon that, along with the military, that are creating sock puppets to plant pro-war propaganda, pro-overthrow of Syria, Libya, Ukraine propaganda throughout the media, while pretending to be alternative.
[01:44:41.366 --> 01:44:43.548]  And so I think when you look at all of that
[01:44:44.404 --> 01:45:07.524]  uh... from all sides and i i i think uh... uh... it before is uh... uh... on some of its uh... uh... uh... positions is uh... exposing the military c i industrial propaganda like in uh... ukraine uh... syria libya but on the other hand it uh... it it promotes us uh... those that propaganda will come to china and uh... cuba venezuela and sometimes even iran but i think that uh... people have really got to realize that uh...
[01:45:07.904 --> 01:45:11.085]  Well how do you think we promote the uh... how do you think we promote propaganda?
[01:45:11.105 --> 01:45:14.286]  Did you see the interview that I had with Steve Pachinik on the Nightly News the other night?
[01:45:14.886 --> 01:45:16.206]  No, I don't follow.
[01:45:16.346 --> 01:45:17.527]  Do you know who Steve Pachinik is?
[01:45:17.807 --> 01:45:18.407]  Oh sure I do.
[01:45:18.607 --> 01:45:28.830]  Yeah, okay well just for people who don't know, I mean he was advisor to I think it was five administrations, he brokered the Camp David Agreement, he's got long-term involvement in the intelligence community.
[01:45:29.310 --> 01:45:33.831]  But I asked him about the Ukraine, I asked him about Victoria Nuland and he said it was the most
[01:45:34.711 --> 01:45:39.517]  Outrageous, in-your-face, deliberate challenge that he's ever seen.
[01:45:39.717 --> 01:45:46.625]  The fact that she's claiming that they hacked her phone and the phony outrage from the State Department and the U.S.
[01:45:46.645 --> 01:45:48.927]  government that somebody would actually listen to her phone.
[01:45:49.748 --> 01:45:52.030]  I mean, can I really seriously say that with a straight face?
[01:45:52.070 --> 01:46:02.617]  I mean, they're listening to all of our phones, blanket surveillance, dragnet surveillance, and yet they say, can you imagine the Russians listening to somebody at the State Department's phone?
[01:46:02.637 --> 01:46:12.783]  Of course, she did that just to challenge them, just to foment dangerous relationships, to escalate conflict between the U.S.
[01:46:12.984 --> 01:46:18.787]  and the Russians, I think, as part of a way for the military-industrial complex to get back their profit center.
[01:46:20.889 --> 01:46:24.771]  But how do you think that we are promoting propaganda?
[01:46:24.791 --> 01:46:26.331]  Let me ask you to explain that.
[01:46:26.351 --> 01:46:35.616]  Well, I'm saying on certain countries you're doing a good job, like on the Ukraine and Libya and Syria, and pointing out that Al-Qaeda is really behind these
[01:46:42.342 --> 01:46:59.177]  I think you don't apply the same standards of these color revolutions, the CI subversion, and the lies that were being told simply because they're either nominally socialist or they're semi-socialist and there's a kind of a
[01:46:59.657 --> 01:47:04.760]  A red flag that goes up, that changes the whole standards when it comes to those countries.
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:06.261]  We have talked about Venezuela.
[01:47:06.281 --> 01:47:18.989]  We've talked about how there seems to be a double standard in the way that it is very telling how there's a double standard between the way the... I believe it was Kurt Nimmo who put out an article just a few days ago, so maybe you can go to Infowars.com and check up on that for yourself.
[01:47:23.351 --> 01:47:41.814]  I just think that, like today, talking about applying the same standards to a country, if Russia came over here and tried and overthrew Canada and started to move its missiles into a threatening position in our country and...
[01:47:43.255 --> 01:47:44.896]  How about if they put missiles in Cuba?
[01:47:44.916 --> 01:47:46.517]  Will we see that as a crisis?
[01:47:47.677 --> 01:47:48.338]  I think we have.
[01:47:49.098 --> 01:47:54.801]  And quite honestly, I look at the situation in Ukraine and I have a lot of sympathy for the people of Ukraine.
[01:47:55.501 --> 01:47:58.462]  I know they suffered under tremendous despotism.
[01:47:58.903 --> 01:48:02.904]  I know that the Soviet Union went in, they decapitated their leadership.
[01:48:04.085 --> 01:48:13.230]  Co-opted the churches, they had a massive influx of Russians to immigration to control the country, and then they took away their food and they starved them out.
[01:48:13.290 --> 01:48:15.971]  And so I understand that people are still upset about that.
[01:48:15.991 --> 01:48:17.091]  They should be upset about that.
[01:48:17.632 --> 01:48:21.614]  But we also understand there's another gang that's out there eager to subjugate them.
[01:48:21.934 --> 01:48:23.755]  I hope they get their independence somehow.
[01:48:24.415 --> 01:48:30.216]  You know, they're jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire if they get under the control of these European bankers and the IMF.
[01:48:30.256 --> 01:48:31.797]  We said that was happening and now we see it.
[01:48:31.817 --> 01:48:37.318]  As we talked about with Paul Joseph Watson last hour, the IMF is there with, they're going to outbid the Russians.
[01:48:37.378 --> 01:48:43.779]  Instead of $15 billion, the IMF is going to come in with $35 billion and they're going to loot the country left and right.
[01:48:43.879 --> 01:48:44.580]  It's just really sad.
[01:48:44.620 --> 01:48:47.080]  Well, thanks John for calling in from Ohio.
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:49.221]  We've got Brad in Connecticut.
[01:48:49.241 --> 01:48:50.701]  He wanted to talk about Sandy Hook.
[01:48:54.168 --> 01:49:06.235]  I just want to bring up a couple of inconsistencies and weird things that I found from doing my own research about whatever went on in Sandy Hook.
[01:49:06.495 --> 01:49:13.299]  There is the evidence pictures that you can see online and there is two black sweatshirts.
[01:49:14.179 --> 01:49:20.963]  One's by the front passenger and the other's by the rear passenger that are just left on the ground and they never really talk about that.
[01:49:22.486 --> 01:49:25.208]  Yeah, there's a lot of anomalies.
[01:49:25.248 --> 01:49:32.933]  I mean, the article, the interview that Wolfgang Halbig had with American Free Press, it was a 45 minute long interview.
[01:49:34.975 --> 01:49:40.119]  Don Salazar, not Paul Joseph Watson, but Don Salazar had a detailed argument talking about
[01:49:41.159 --> 01:49:45.364]  He kind of focused on the crime scene because that's his investigation background.
[01:49:45.404 --> 01:49:47.226]  He's a former state trooper.
[01:49:47.246 --> 01:49:49.509]  He's a school security consultant.
[01:49:49.549 --> 01:49:53.714]  So there's a lot of strange things that are going on in the periphery of that.
[01:49:53.814 --> 01:49:55.175]  It's very strange that
[01:49:55.796 --> 01:49:58.577]  You don't have any families that have sued.
[01:49:58.617 --> 01:50:00.277]  That's never happened before in a shooting.
[01:50:00.397 --> 01:50:02.178]  There's never been any families that sued.
[01:50:02.718 --> 01:50:12.481]  It was interesting that you did have one family that was going to sue and they were going to sue for a hundred million dollars because, not because their daughter was killed, but because she was frightened.
[01:50:13.522 --> 01:50:18.303]  And they backed off of that after just two weeks and nobody has sued them for negligence.
[01:50:18.343 --> 01:50:20.644]  And of course that's the first thing that seems to happen.
[01:50:20.784 --> 01:50:23.445]  And if they were concerned about children's safety,
[01:50:24.065 --> 01:50:29.529]  You would think that they would be open to school safety consultants like Wolfgang Halbig.
[01:50:29.569 --> 01:50:31.150]  So we want to get him back on.
[01:50:31.170 --> 01:50:33.072]  It's an amazing set of facts.
[01:50:33.092 --> 01:50:38.496]  He's been researching this since it happened in spite of the stonewalling from Connecticut.
[01:50:39.196 --> 01:50:40.917]  And we've had him on the nightly news.
[01:50:40.957 --> 01:50:44.200]  We want to have him on the radio soon and we hope that that'll happen.
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:46.421]  But today he had a family emergency.
[01:50:47.362 --> 01:50:48.282]  Our prayers go out to him.
[01:50:48.302 --> 01:50:52.083]  We're going to be right back with Jakari Jackson and we're going to take more of your calls.
[01:50:52.123 --> 01:51:00.985]  We're talking about Ukraine, we're talking about the attack on the family, the attack on the family farm, and the attack on free speech from the FCC.
[01:51:01.105 --> 01:51:02.246]  So stay tuned, we'll be right back.

[01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:39.120]  Survive to fish.
[01:51:40.717 --> 01:51:42.118]  My name is Jessica Armand.
[01:51:42.238 --> 01:51:44.920]  I'm an activist, a GCN listener, and mother of three.
[01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:49.762]  Our drinking water and food are filled with fluoride and other contaminants that harm our teeth and gums.

[01:52:09.847 --> 01:52:10.247]  Question.
[01:52:10.608 --> 01:52:14.851]  Could too many GMO foods and toxins be overloading your digestive and immune systems?
[01:52:15.412 --> 01:52:16.252]  Answer, yes.
[01:52:16.673 --> 01:52:22.457]  If you're searching for a powerful detox that's gentle enough to use every day, use Pro-EM-1 from Teriganics.

[01:53:09.557 --> 01:53:10.398]  The facts are in.
[01:53:10.598 --> 01:53:11.700]  The studies are legion.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:19.368]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:53:19.509 --> 01:53:22.973]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:53:23.353 --> 01:53:23.734]  Simple.
[01:53:23.914 --> 01:53:28.319]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:53:28.619 --> 01:53:34.084]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:53:34.324 --> 01:53:39.729]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Live fluoride shield formulation.
[01:53:39.889 --> 01:53:50.399]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:53:50.679 --> 01:53:54.883]  Let's take a stand against the globalists by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.

[01:54:25.814 --> 01:54:27.176]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:27.196 --> 01:54:28.617]  I'm David Knight, filling in for Alex.
[01:54:28.678 --> 01:54:33.483]  I'm joined here in studio with Jakari Jackson, another member of the Nightly News crew.
[01:54:33.984 --> 01:54:39.130]  And we're going to be joined by Leanne McAdoo at the bottom of the hour.
[01:54:39.190 --> 01:54:41.794]  She's gonna come in and swap out with Jakari Jackson.
[01:54:41.814 --> 01:54:44.257]  We're taking your calls, talking about news articles today.
[01:54:44.297 --> 01:54:45.218]  We've been talking about
[01:54:45.956 --> 01:55:01.952]  The attack on the family, the attack on the family farm, what's going on in the Ukraine, what does that mean for, not just the Ukrainian people, but what does it mean for us as we see the American government escalating this conflict between... All the war hawks and everybody's ready to go.
[01:55:02.273 --> 01:55:04.034]  Oh yeah, I mean you start going after...
[01:55:05.035 --> 01:55:16.909]  Ukraine and Russia, and you start going after the Crimea, which is their access to water, that's going to be a very... Yeah, we had a caller call in last week talking about the ports out there, and that's a very real concern.
[01:55:17.089 --> 01:55:19.192]  Yeah, that's a good way to stir up a hornet's nest.
[01:55:19.212 --> 01:55:24.999]  If you wanted to start World War III, that's the way you would do it, and we've seen a lot of signs, and we've seen, we've heard warnings from people.
[01:55:26.039 --> 01:55:30.361]  Like Skousen saying that that's exactly what he thinks the government wants to do is start World War III.
[01:55:30.421 --> 01:55:35.524]  We know that governments always profit when there's a war or there's a fear of a war.
[01:55:36.004 --> 01:55:42.607]  So the question is do they just want to drum up conflict between us and Russia and China and Iran?
[01:55:43.207 --> 01:55:52.472]  Certainly that's in the interest of dictatorships like Iran and countries where you've got an oligarchy that's running it like China.
[01:55:53.052 --> 01:55:59.257]  It certainly makes them stronger to brag about how they want to go to war and how prepared they are for war.
[01:55:59.277 --> 01:56:05.361]  But of course, our government is becoming more and more like a dictatorship in every respect, so you would expect them to start doing that.
[01:56:05.441 --> 01:56:11.686]  Even the situation in Syria, where Obama says they crossed the red line, and then he says, no, the American people say they crossed the red line.
[01:56:12.026 --> 01:56:17.310]  Then they show the videos of these YouTube videos with the Al-Qaeda logo on it, show it on the big networks.
[01:56:17.370 --> 01:56:18.371]  You see, it's Assad.
[01:56:18.411 --> 01:56:21.193]  I'm like, oh, Assad with the Al-Qaeda logo on his video.
[01:56:21.213 --> 01:56:22.574]  Like, okay, that makes perfect sense.
[01:56:22.654 --> 01:56:22.954]  That's right.
[01:56:23.154 --> 01:56:25.975]  I guess we're not really too far away from the day when the U.S.
[01:56:26.015 --> 01:56:30.317]  military is going to parade down the streets of Washington on May Day.
[01:56:30.337 --> 01:56:35.818]  Of course, they're already sending out the military vehicles to every village and town.
[01:56:36.399 --> 01:56:42.041]  We've got anti-mine vehicles that are going to every village and town, so I guess they don't need the May Day parade anymore.
[01:56:42.261 --> 01:56:45.362]  I think it's Ohio State, they have that big mine-proof truck.
[01:56:46.502 --> 01:56:50.563]  What kind of frat parties are you guys busting up that you need something that big?
[01:56:51.384 --> 01:56:52.064]  That's my question.
[01:56:52.324 --> 01:56:52.685]  That's right.
[01:56:52.725 --> 01:56:53.666]  Well, let's go to our callers.
[01:56:53.706 --> 01:56:58.674]  We had one caller from Texas, Timmy from Texas, who's been on for a while, hanging on for a while.
[01:56:58.734 --> 01:57:00.818]  You wanted to say something about pension fraud?
[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:03.261]  I read an article.
[01:57:03.281 --> 01:57:05.083]  It was posted yesterday on Drudge.
[01:57:05.723 --> 01:57:07.765]  It was only there for yesterday, but it's over.
[01:57:08.586 --> 01:57:20.256]  It was from Yahoo News, and it said that over 100 firefighters and policemen are being arrested for pension fraud stemming from the 9-11 pensions they got.
[01:57:20.296 --> 01:57:22.418]  I guess they retired shortly after 9-11.
[01:57:22.899 --> 01:57:28.924]  And I just wanted to discuss with you guys if there may, you know, you guys might think there'd be a deeper plot as far as
[01:57:29.508 --> 01:57:31.910]  These are the guys that just kept quiet and took the money.
[01:57:32.431 --> 01:57:37.015]  But in reality, they could be the guys to speak out and say there was maybe a proof of explosive.
[01:57:37.595 --> 01:57:41.699]  And instead they took the money, which in the article states is over $400 million.
[01:57:41.739 --> 01:57:44.321]  So spread that out over 100 people or so.
[01:57:44.341 --> 01:57:45.262]  I mean, that's a lot of money.
[01:57:45.582 --> 01:57:46.183]  What do you guys think?
[01:57:46.755 --> 01:57:47.516]  Well, it's hard to say.
[01:57:47.556 --> 01:57:55.503]  I mean, frankly, I wouldn't be surprised to find anything associated with the 9-11 situation, but we know how the government has used it.
[01:57:55.543 --> 01:57:56.904]  We've covered it over and over again.
[01:57:56.984 --> 01:57:59.727]  Alex has talked to eyewitnesses.
[01:58:00.047 --> 01:58:02.049]  We have done documentaries.
[01:58:02.069 --> 01:58:03.010]  We've covered the news.
[01:58:03.230 --> 01:58:06.033]  It's just amazing, and we see it happening over and over again.
[01:58:06.053 --> 01:58:08.215]  I mean, what do you think about the fact that
[01:58:08.855 --> 01:58:14.018]  Rachel Maddow and MSNBC and CNN are talking about how phony the Boston bombing looks.
[01:58:14.379 --> 01:58:18.961]  Having issues with the fact that the FBI would pick somebody up for questioning and then shoot him in the back of the head.
[01:58:19.102 --> 01:58:20.923]  Well, shoot him six times and once in the back of the head.
[01:58:20.983 --> 01:58:22.704]  I mean, hang on, we'll be right back.
[01:58:22.744 --> 01:58:24.025]  I want to know what you think about that.
[01:58:24.305 --> 01:58:29.248]  Stay tuned, we'll talk about the awakening of the mainstream media, if that's what's going on.
[01:58:29.268 --> 01:58:31.409]  I guess you can say that to an extent.
[01:58:31.730 --> 01:58:32.430]  Maybe, yeah.
[01:58:32.550 --> 01:58:33.551]  We'll see what's behind that.
[01:58:34.511 --> 01:58:35.372]  Stay tuned, we'll be right back.
[01:58:52.449 --> 01:58:56.450]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[02:00:14.639 --> 02:00:15.279]  Big Brother.
[02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:16.980]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:17.721 --> 02:00:18.842]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:19.482 --> 02:00:20.282]  You want answers?
[02:00:21.063 --> 02:00:21.983]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:22.604 --> 02:00:26.266]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:26.806 --> 02:00:30.849]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.330 --> 02:00:33.571]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:33.591 --> 02:00:42.018]  I'm David Knight-Fillian for Alex Today, and I'm joined in studio with my fellow nightly news reporter, Jakari Jackson, and we're taking your calls on a variety of subjects.
[02:00:42.578 --> 02:00:54.228]  Just before the break, we had a caller asking us what we thought about the pension fraud story, if we thought it might possibly be related to the 9-11, what we believe is a conspiracy there, but I asked him a question.
[02:00:54.268 --> 02:00:55.429]  I wanted to know what he thought.
[02:00:56.209 --> 02:01:04.348]  about Rachel Maddow at MSNBC starting to talk now about the FBI assassinating a witness in the Boston bombing and CNN
[02:01:05.566 --> 02:01:08.127]  Actually questioning the government's official story.
[02:01:08.467 --> 02:01:10.987]  Typically they're the ones who put out the government's official story.
[02:01:11.007 --> 02:01:20.370]  I mean, it was amazing when the Boston bombing was happening, we would question details of the narrative and a half hour later we would, it was almost like CNN was responding.
[02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:21.270]  It was kind of surreal.
[02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:22.370]  Yeah, it was pretty surreal.
[02:01:22.710 --> 02:01:30.652]  But they were the spokespersons for what was going on with the Boston bombing and now, I guess to try to bolster their credibility, they're questioning it.
[02:01:31.112 --> 02:01:32.312]  What do you make of that, Collar?
[02:01:33.393 --> 02:01:34.013]  Timmy in Texas?
[02:01:34.233 --> 02:01:34.373]  Yeah.
[02:01:35.421 --> 02:01:40.225]  David, it's like you say, every day on y'all's introductions, they're on the run.
[02:01:40.305 --> 02:01:41.125]  We got them on the run.
[02:01:41.145 --> 02:01:44.288]  The Info Wars is defeating the dinosaur media.
[02:01:44.668 --> 02:01:50.992]  One more thing, on that previous story I covered, Victoria Cavalier with Reuters is who wrote that story.
[02:01:51.012 --> 02:01:52.914]  Jakari, you said you'd want to look into it.
[02:01:53.334 --> 02:01:59.618]  It's just, you know, when big corporate bankers violate or have some sort of fraud against them, there's a hearing on it.
[02:01:59.658 --> 02:02:00.858]  They're not arrested immediately.
[02:02:00.898 --> 02:02:04.220]  And there's over 100 firefighters and policemen that have been arrested.
[02:02:04.260 --> 02:02:07.882]  So it just seems really sketchy, I guess you could say.
[02:02:08.162 --> 02:02:08.363]  Yeah.
[02:02:08.483 --> 02:02:09.903]  And one last thing, guys.
[02:02:10.144 --> 02:02:12.305]  I got to meet y'all there at the Alamo.
[02:02:12.345 --> 02:02:15.086]  Jakari, you were wandering around, lost, trying to find the march.
[02:02:15.226 --> 02:02:16.907]  And I ran into you with a buddy of mine.
[02:02:17.308 --> 02:02:19.089]  So good to meet you guys.
[02:02:19.129 --> 02:02:20.609]  David, I had mentioned to you about the
[02:02:22.262 --> 02:02:25.245]  The Secret Service agent swabbing his children for some odd reason.
[02:02:25.285 --> 02:02:26.786]  I don't know if you remember that conversation.
[02:02:27.486 --> 02:02:27.847]  Yeah.
[02:02:28.507 --> 02:02:29.868]  But it's good to talk to you guys.
[02:02:29.968 --> 02:02:33.851]  And remember, the guy I was with, Ja'Cory, his name's Sean, and he's super trendy.
[02:02:35.873 --> 02:02:37.955]  Well, thanks, Timmy, and thanks for showing up at the Alamo.
[02:02:37.975 --> 02:02:40.517]  You know, we have to stand up for our freedoms or we lose them.
[02:02:40.717 --> 02:02:47.282]  And it's very, very important for us to stand on the freedoms that the government recognizes.
[02:02:47.342 --> 02:02:48.523]  They recognize so few.
[02:02:48.583 --> 02:02:50.905]  And when it's legal to open carry a rifle,
[02:02:51.545 --> 02:02:59.007]  And the police are harassing people for that because they want to make the public, they've gone on record, Eric Holder has said that he wants to brainwash the public.
[02:02:59.427 --> 02:03:05.088]  They want everyone to be afraid, not only of the sight of guns, but the sight of someone with a gun.
[02:03:05.228 --> 02:03:11.830]  And I'm glad the caller brought that up, the Alamo, because everybody asks, you know, we go out here, we fight every day, we get on the show every day.
[02:03:12.150 --> 02:03:13.551]  You know, what progress is being made?
[02:03:13.631 --> 02:03:19.215]  That's progress going out to the Alamo because we had a police chief who said he was going to arrest anybody who came out there with a gun.
[02:03:19.576 --> 02:03:21.657]  You had a thousand-plus people show up with guns.
[02:03:21.938 --> 02:03:22.538]  That's a victory.
[02:03:22.578 --> 02:03:27.081]  When the food babe comes on here and says Subway needs to take the stuff out of the food, that's a victory.
[02:03:27.102 --> 02:03:35.328]  When you have the Hernandez family in San Antonio, Texas, saying that we're not going to wear your RFID tags, they fight it out, Catherine Albrecht gets involved, they win, that's a victory.
[02:03:35.408 --> 02:03:36.689]  Victories happen every day.
[02:03:37.109 --> 02:03:40.971]  You don't see this on your mainstream network, so people just think we're just banging our head against the wall.
[02:03:41.411 --> 02:03:45.433]  Occasionally, we knock a hole through that wall, bust through it, and get the bad guys out of there.
[02:03:45.553 --> 02:03:47.494]  It can happen, but you have to be persistent.
[02:03:47.734 --> 02:03:50.315]  You can't give up and just be encouraged to keep going at it.
[02:03:50.515 --> 02:03:50.875]  That's right.
[02:03:50.955 --> 02:03:57.799]  You've got Rachel Maddow, who's gone from laughing at Alex Jones and making all kinds of bizarre accusations about him.
[02:03:58.219 --> 02:04:00.280]  I mean, he's just questioning the government's official story.
[02:04:00.320 --> 02:04:02.161]  Now she's questioning the government's official story.
[02:04:02.181 --> 02:04:03.441]  That's a huge turnaround.
[02:04:03.741 --> 02:04:05.162]  Let's go to Jerry Inouye.
[02:04:07.304 --> 02:04:14.990]  I'm a longtime listener and I think you guys have been doing a wonderful job.
[02:04:15.070 --> 02:04:16.772]  I just wanted to get that out to you.
[02:04:17.792 --> 02:04:20.134]  You guys are excellent watchmen.
[02:04:20.174 --> 02:04:22.897]  You're letting people know what's happening and what to expect.
[02:04:23.926 --> 02:04:34.876]  And I was just wanting to let you know, I've been living in Northeastern Ohio for most of my life and it's looking more and more like I'm living in Communist China.
[02:04:35.995 --> 02:04:38.756]  Uh, they are pressuring the farmers up here.
[02:04:38.776 --> 02:04:51.019]  Uh, they are building housing allotments right next to farms and then people are complaining that they can smell the cows, they can hear chickens, they can hear pigs.
[02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:55.141]  I mean, they're really just trying to crowd the farmers out.
[02:04:57.588 --> 02:04:58.769]  Hang on, we're going to talk about that.
[02:04:58.789 --> 02:05:06.491]  This LA Times story has a very interesting contradiction between what people want in terms of fresh food and what they think about farms.
[02:05:06.631 --> 02:05:07.891]  Stay tuned, we'll be right back.
[02:05:08.231 --> 02:05:09.632]  Hang on, Jerry, we'll come right back to you.
[02:05:09.852 --> 02:05:10.712]  The facts are in.
[02:05:10.892 --> 02:05:12.033]  The studies are legion.
[02:05:12.293 --> 02:05:19.695]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[02:05:19.815 --> 02:05:23.236]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[02:05:23.616 --> 02:05:24.036]  Simple.
[02:05:24.197 --> 02:05:28.640]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:34.384]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[02:05:34.624 --> 02:05:50.636]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[02:05:50.956 --> 02:05:55.200]  Let's take a stand against the globalists by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[02:05:55.540 --> 02:05:57.362]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.

[02:06:09.714 --> 02:06:15.321]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[02:06:15.522 --> 02:06:22.751]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[02:06:22.911 --> 02:06:26.095]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[02:06:26.255 --> 02:06:28.036]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[02:06:28.296 --> 02:06:32.859]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[02:06:32.939 --> 02:06:35.701]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[02:06:35.861 --> 02:06:41.624]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[02:06:41.824 --> 02:06:45.286]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[02:06:45.486 --> 02:06:50.529]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[02:06:50.729 --> 02:06:53.711]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:53.951 --> 02:06:59.814]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[02:06:59.934 --> 02:07:01.936]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.
[02:07:02.096 --> 02:07:07.519]  Secure your super high quality Nascent Iodine today at InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:13.421]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[02:07:13.521 --> 02:07:15.762]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:07:15.942 --> 02:07:24.245]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[02:07:24.545 --> 02:07:32.488]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic
[02:07:32.828 --> 02:07:40.635]  Super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:07:40.856 --> 02:07:48.503]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:07:48.883 --> 02:07:54.985]  Supermail Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[02:08:21.687 --> 02:08:27.993]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:28.413 --> 02:08:33.298]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Thursday, February 27th, 2014.
[02:08:33.938 --> 02:08:34.579]  I'm David Knight.
[02:08:34.819 --> 02:08:36.220]  I'm filling in for Alex Jones.
[02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:40.204]  I'm joined here in studio with Jakari Jackson, and we've been taking your calls.
[02:08:40.264 --> 02:08:43.707]  Just before the break, we were talking to Jerry in Ohio.
[02:08:43.747 --> 02:08:47.430]  We were talking about farmers, and I asked him to hang on over the break.
[02:08:48.288 --> 02:08:54.755]  We've got this article from the LA Times talking about planned food safety rules attacking organic farmers.
[02:08:55.456 --> 02:08:56.157]  Listen to what they said.
[02:08:56.177 --> 02:08:58.239]  They interviewed a guy, his name is Jim Crawford.
[02:08:58.299 --> 02:09:09.311]  He's an organic farmer and he said that the FDA came to him and said, this is my badge, these are the fines, this is what's hanging over your head and we want you to know that.
[02:09:09.952 --> 02:09:11.172]  Just pure intimidation.
[02:09:11.432 --> 02:09:12.653]  What are they intimidating them about?
[02:09:12.933 --> 02:09:16.554]  Well, they're intimidating them over using natural fertilizer.
[02:09:17.074 --> 02:09:18.554]  You know, what we call manure.
[02:09:19.375 --> 02:09:23.176]  And it's being pushed by, of course, big agri, big corporations.
[02:09:23.516 --> 02:09:27.457]  It's also being pushed by NGOs like the Center for Science and the Public Interest.
[02:09:27.877 --> 02:09:33.019]  They're pushing the FDA not to yield to these family farmers, but to shut them down.
[02:09:33.499 --> 02:09:37.640]  This is the last statement he had to say, and then I want to get Jerry and Ohio's comments on this.
[02:09:38.280 --> 02:09:40.742]  This is what Jim Crawford, the guy that they talked to, said.
[02:09:40.782 --> 02:09:48.790]  He said, the public loves to love and idealize us little family farmers, but the vast majority of us are hanging by a thread.
[02:09:49.410 --> 02:09:52.513]  Now the government is saying, we're going to put a lot more weight on that thread.
[02:09:53.094 --> 02:09:55.016]  What do you think about that, Jerry in Ohio?
[02:09:56.283 --> 02:10:04.428]  Yeah, like I was telling you, they have these township people and they drive around and they're like little mini-Nazis.
[02:10:05.389 --> 02:10:13.454]  If you have a compost bin, if you don't go to get a permit to have one, they come out and they take pictures of it.
[02:10:13.755 --> 02:10:16.136]  Oh, the Green Police.
[02:10:16.516 --> 02:10:18.438]  The Green Police, what's that, that Audi commercial?
[02:10:18.678 --> 02:10:18.958]  Yeah.
[02:10:19.238 --> 02:10:19.338]  Oh.
[02:10:19.919 --> 02:10:20.159]  Yeah.
[02:10:20.539 --> 02:10:24.562]  It says, creating an America that is filled with snoops.
[02:10:25.382 --> 02:10:27.464]  Oh, in so many different ways.
[02:10:27.504 --> 02:10:29.826]  We see America turning into East Germany.
[02:10:30.526 --> 02:10:45.539]  I talked to William Binney, who was the technical director globally of the NSA until he resigned right after 9-11, because he saw the government violating the restrictions that have been put on them about foreign intelligence surveillance, that they were to keep it foreign.
[02:10:45.839 --> 02:10:53.786]  He was somebody who has spent his entire life watching people, watching the government in the Soviet Union, watching the government in East Germany.
[02:10:54.406 --> 02:10:57.188]  And he said that we are becoming exactly like them.
[02:10:57.288 --> 02:10:58.449]  We're going down that path.
[02:10:58.590 --> 02:11:03.674]  And it's not just the government spying on people, but it's the citizens who got this... The snitch culture.
[02:11:03.854 --> 02:11:04.394]  Exactly.
[02:11:04.514 --> 02:11:05.756]  That's what they did in East Germany.
[02:11:06.136 --> 02:11:08.738]  It was getting the citizens to report on each other.
[02:11:08.778 --> 02:11:15.724]  Now, of course, they've got the technology, and it makes it even worse, but it's just creating this snitch mentality, which is what you're talking about, Jerry.
[02:11:16.892 --> 02:11:28.895]  And also, here in Northeast Ohio, they're putting in like these little mini-highways through all these small towns, and they're cutting back all the trees, and they're putting in all these cameras.
[02:11:30.536 --> 02:11:43.739]  What I was told was that when the uprisings begin, and when the cities are burning, that the military are actually going to use the small towns surrounding these big cities to set up command posts.
[02:11:44.933 --> 02:11:50.218]  And also, I've seen some FEMA places also popping up up here.
[02:12:02.090 --> 02:12:05.833]  Bullets and the targets, the targets of little children, the targets of pregnant women.
[02:12:06.133 --> 02:12:07.914]  It's all coming home and they got cameras all over.
[02:12:07.934 --> 02:12:09.896]  They got, you know, 40 plus downtown Austin.
[02:12:09.936 --> 02:12:10.476]  They need more.
[02:12:10.796 --> 02:12:16.400]  They're saying if we had more cameras we wouldn't have fights, you know, like the video, even though there's a camera right where the video was taking place.
[02:12:16.420 --> 02:12:18.121]  Well, they don't like you taking pictures of them, though.
[02:12:18.502 --> 02:12:18.842]  Oh, no.
[02:12:18.982 --> 02:12:19.122]  Yeah.
[02:12:19.682 --> 02:12:26.647]  And we just reported on the nightly news that Cisco is competing with IBM in order to create a physical
[02:12:27.728 --> 02:12:28.569]  Information Highway
[02:12:57.889 --> 02:13:07.790]  Paul Joseph Watson exposed the fact that, or it was Kit, I forget which one of our writers found the story, but they saw an RFP from the Department of Homeland Security to create a...
[02:13:09.016 --> 02:13:30.370]  License database a car license database and then they that went viral and within a couple of days DHS Homeland Security said no no we're withdrawing that we're withdrawing that but we and yet and worse yeah exactly and yet at the same time you see in the tech world you see these reports that IBM and Cisco are competing against each other as to who's going to provide the physical
[02:13:31.030 --> 02:13:37.253]  Information Highway that's going to collect all this information, all this data on you, just in the name of, we're going to make it easy for you.
[02:13:37.273 --> 02:13:39.555]  We're going to let you have internet all the time in your car.
[02:13:39.575 --> 02:13:41.095]  You're going to be able to watch it.
[02:13:41.115 --> 02:13:46.418]  When you go to these cities, these downtown centers, and they say they have the free Wi-Fi, you know, they can spy on you while you're using their thing.
[02:13:46.638 --> 02:13:48.379]  And I'm talking about the license plate scanners.
[02:13:48.419 --> 02:13:52.161]  Now they have police cruisers, I guess they've had them for a while, that can read your license plate.
[02:13:52.181 --> 02:13:55.283]  They're just driving around scanning everybody, violating your Fourth Amendment.
[02:13:55.303 --> 02:13:57.244]  They have no reason, no probable cause to search you.
[02:13:57.584 --> 02:13:59.285]  Also, the red light cameras can do this as well.
[02:13:59.485 --> 02:14:06.891]  Yeah, and they want you to be able to surf the internet and tell them what you're thinking while you're driving along in your driverless car.
[02:14:07.371 --> 02:14:07.452]  Yes.
[02:14:07.492 --> 02:14:09.793]  Okay, which you no longer have control over that anymore either.
[02:14:10.154 --> 02:14:12.336]  Let's go to Tony in Idaho.
[02:14:12.356 --> 02:14:13.777]  You wanted to talk about the family?
[02:14:13.897 --> 02:14:15.378]  We were talking about that earlier, Tony?
[02:14:16.459 --> 02:14:19.001]  Yeah, good to talk to you guys.
[02:14:19.141 --> 02:14:25.687]  I heard Glenn Beck, when he was talking about the little girl, what all they had done to her.
[02:14:25.927 --> 02:14:28.609]  I hadn't heard that they had put her in foster care, though.
[02:14:30.260 --> 02:14:38.385]  What the government does is they're manipulating the law to kind of justify themselves to do a lot of this stuff, and they do it through registration.
[02:14:40.026 --> 02:14:43.328]  They bring the people up in the schools, and the people aren't taught the law.
[02:14:43.368 --> 02:14:46.871]  They don't know what the government's doing or how the government's manipulating the law.
[02:14:47.351 --> 02:14:56.297]  But basically, when you allow your baby to be registered with a birth certificate, you're registering that child to the government.
[02:14:56.852 --> 02:15:02.694]  And once you do that, then the maximum of law says the source of the right determines the governing law.
[02:15:03.134 --> 02:15:05.594]  So when you register it to the government, then they take it.
[02:15:05.854 --> 02:15:06.555]  They just take it.
[02:15:06.575 --> 02:15:08.155]  They have a right to do anything they want.
[02:15:08.595 --> 02:15:08.975]  Exactly.
[02:15:08.995 --> 02:15:19.618]  And when you talk about the school system, this whole generation, I guess it happens generation to generation, they'll rob you of some type of practical knowledge like we see now in our current military.
[02:15:19.638 --> 02:15:22.018]  They're not teaching these young guys about the Bill of Rights.
[02:15:22.038 --> 02:15:23.859]  They're not teaching people about constitutional rights.
[02:15:24.679 --> 02:15:33.545]  They don't want you to know this stuff, so when you come out into the streets to do whatever duties you have to do, you don't know, you're not conscious of these things.
[02:15:33.845 --> 02:15:37.748]  And it happens generation to generation, just with our current system.
[02:15:37.768 --> 02:15:41.390]  There's not going to be a generation who doesn't understand or who hasn't been fed this
[02:15:41.850 --> 02:15:42.470]  I don't think so.
[02:16:03.278 --> 02:16:06.382]  There weren't any policemen in the schools.
[02:16:06.663 --> 02:16:08.425]  We didn't have metal detectors.
[02:16:08.465 --> 02:16:09.646]  We didn't have school lockdown.
[02:16:09.686 --> 02:16:10.487]  We didn't have any of that stuff.
[02:16:10.868 --> 02:16:15.293]  Today, the kids are being raised in a model of a police state.
[02:16:16.134 --> 02:16:17.616]  You know, I've said it over and over again.
[02:16:18.357 --> 02:16:20.658]  Maximum security is actually a prison.
[02:16:21.318 --> 02:16:22.159]  That's what they call a prison.
[02:16:22.179 --> 02:16:29.562]  We see, just like I was talking about earlier in San Antonio, with the RFID trackers at the high schools down there, it's prisoner training.
[02:16:29.802 --> 02:16:34.004]  You give the kids their little ID badge that they have to wear visibly all the time.
[02:16:34.024 --> 02:16:36.805]  You stand in this line, you do this, you can't go here without this permission.
[02:16:37.005 --> 02:16:39.907]  You have to ask permission to go to the water fountain just like you do in jail.
[02:16:39.927 --> 02:16:41.688]  I used to work in jail, that's how it worked.
[02:16:41.868 --> 02:16:43.208]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:16:43.428 --> 02:16:44.149]  If you value
[02:16:45.319 --> 02:16:47.200]  Security over everything else.
[02:16:47.220 --> 02:16:52.564]  You're going to get maximum security, which is a panopticon prison, where everything you do is watched.
[02:16:52.964 --> 02:16:57.447]  You live your life in this fishbowl that the government super analyzes everything that you do.
[02:16:57.487 --> 02:17:00.529]  In many cases, will jump to the wrong conclusion, make you the enemy.
[02:17:01.369 --> 02:17:02.550]  That's what we're coming up to.
[02:17:02.630 --> 02:17:03.471]  Thanks, Tony.
[02:17:03.531 --> 02:17:05.432]  Let's go to Bregan in Wisconsin.
[02:17:05.452 --> 02:17:05.732]  Bregan.
[02:17:08.054 --> 02:17:09.134]  Hey guys.
[02:17:10.415 --> 02:17:10.716]  David.
[02:17:12.573 --> 02:17:13.854]  Sorry, my speakerphone was on.
[02:17:14.254 --> 02:17:22.217]  David, thank you for continuing to pursue this story with Wolfgang.
[02:17:22.698 --> 02:17:23.838]  I really appreciate that.
[02:17:24.518 --> 02:17:26.799]  Our hopes and prayers are with him.
[02:17:29.081 --> 02:17:39.544]  And for those people who haven't heard, Wolfgang Halbig is a former state trooper, former educator, a school security consultant, who started investigating Sandy Hook because that's what he does.
[02:17:39.584 --> 02:17:40.705]  He looks at school security.
[02:17:40.945 --> 02:17:48.887]  They want to tell you that all these gun regulations are to keep the children safe, but they don't want school security experts to know anything about the crime scene.
[02:17:49.287 --> 02:17:55.212]  And after cover-up, after cover-up, after 10 months of trying to get FOIA information, they started threatening him.
[02:17:55.252 --> 02:17:56.533]  They started pushing back against him.
[02:17:56.593 --> 02:17:58.775]  So we've had him on the nightly news.
[02:17:58.795 --> 02:18:01.517]  We wanted to get him on today, but he had a family emergency.
[02:18:01.537 --> 02:18:02.378]  Go ahead, Bregan.
[02:18:03.799 --> 02:18:09.383]  I have a few questions for Wolfgang, but I'll save that for when he gets back on the show.
[02:18:09.823 --> 02:18:13.807]  But one of the primary questions would be, where is all that video?
[02:18:13.947 --> 02:18:16.469]  I mean, they've... Yeah, that's the question since day one.
[02:18:17.301 --> 02:18:28.827]  Yeah, they've exploited all that video from Columbine and every other school shooting and every other mass murder event, and why won't they use it this time?
[02:18:29.007 --> 02:18:35.390]  Well, a lot of people suspect that maybe there is no video showing that very fact.
[02:18:38.550 --> 02:18:43.551]  Thanks again for pursuing Wolfgang and our thoughts and prayers are with him.
[02:18:43.671 --> 02:18:44.692]  I hope he's doing okay.
[02:18:44.972 --> 02:18:47.633]  Well, thank you, Bregan, and thank you for helping us up there in Wisconsin.
[02:18:47.653 --> 02:18:54.194]  You've been involved with the raw milk trials that have taken place up there, and you brought Wolfgang to at least my attention.
[02:18:54.274 --> 02:18:58.436]  I think the writers found him, but thank you so much for your help and following with us.
[02:18:58.636 --> 02:19:00.396]  Let's go to Scott in Texas.
[02:19:00.996 --> 02:19:01.256]  Scott.
[02:19:01.276 --> 02:19:02.957]  I want to talk to you.
[02:19:04.617 --> 02:19:06.942]  Ask your questions, really, about foreign troops.
[02:19:07.282 --> 02:19:10.989]  I know Alex covers this quite a bit on the show.
[02:19:11.009 --> 02:19:13.614]  Got some questions first.
[02:19:13.775 --> 02:19:14.837]  How many troops are there?
[02:19:16.537 --> 02:19:20.278]  I don't have an exact number, but we've seen various drills.
[02:19:20.318 --> 02:19:22.999]  I believe they had one in Miami one or two years ago.
[02:19:23.039 --> 02:19:24.399]  They had troops from all over the world.
[02:19:24.459 --> 02:19:31.921]  I even think there's a few Japanese personnel there as well, running the drills where they had to rescue the mayor.
[02:19:31.961 --> 02:19:33.062]  Yeah, it fluctuates.
[02:19:33.082 --> 02:19:34.422]  They'll bring them in for drills.
[02:19:34.462 --> 02:19:35.823]  Sometimes they'll bring them in for training.
[02:19:37.847 --> 02:19:41.849]  We've got an Australian general who is over some U.S.
[02:19:41.889 --> 02:19:42.610]  troops right now.
[02:19:42.750 --> 02:19:46.212]  I mean, it's pretty amazing the involvement that we have with that.
[02:19:46.272 --> 02:19:48.713]  But hang on, we've got to go to a commercial break.
[02:19:48.733 --> 02:19:49.614]  We're going to be right back.
[02:19:49.634 --> 02:19:51.635]  We've been talking about the attack on the family.
[02:19:51.655 --> 02:19:54.496]  We've been talking about the attack on the family farm.
[02:19:54.676 --> 02:19:56.798]  And we've been talking about what's going on in Ukraine.
[02:19:56.918 --> 02:19:58.218]  What is our government doing?
[02:19:58.258 --> 02:20:00.700]  Are they trying to foster another World War III?
[02:20:00.720 --> 02:20:04.422]  Or are they just trying to build up the military-industrial complex?
[02:20:04.862 --> 02:20:05.282]  Stay tuned.
[02:20:05.382 --> 02:20:06.063]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:09.912 --> 02:20:13.554]  You've been hearing about the amazing benefits of Heart and Body Extract for many years.
[02:20:13.934 --> 02:20:15.275]  Now, hear from the co-founder.

[02:22:09.414 --> 02:22:09.814]  Hi there.
[02:22:10.415 --> 02:22:11.495]  My name is Frank Bates.
[02:22:11.956 --> 02:22:15.158]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[02:22:15.778 --> 02:22:24.564]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[02:22:24.924 --> 02:22:30.948]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[02:22:31.629 --> 02:22:33.210]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[02:22:33.810 --> 02:22:38.914]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[02:22:39.634 --> 02:22:46.717]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[02:22:47.577 --> 02:22:52.479]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[02:22:53.140 --> 02:22:59.042]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[02:22:59.642 --> 02:23:04.985]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:23:05.365 --> 02:23:06.505]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[02:23:08.288 --> 02:23:18.574]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:23:18.894 --> 02:23:20.755]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:23:20.935 --> 02:23:21.615]  Fluoride!
[02:23:21.835 --> 02:23:23.396]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:23:23.737 --> 02:23:30.020]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:23:30.260 --> 02:23:35.021]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[02:23:35.161 --> 02:23:41.203]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:23:41.443 --> 02:23:43.603]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[02:23:43.863 --> 02:23:46.444]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[02:23:46.764 --> 02:23:50.105]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[02:23:50.245 --> 02:23:54.826]  You will find survival shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at Infowarslife.com.
[02:23:55.646 --> 02:24:00.415]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[02:24:25.413 --> 02:24:26.754]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:26.814 --> 02:24:28.255]  I'm David Knight filling in for Alex.
[02:24:28.395 --> 02:24:31.737]  I'm joined here in the studio with Jakari Jackson and we're taking your calls now.
[02:24:31.757 --> 02:24:34.939]  We're going to be joined in the next segment with Leanne McAdoo.
[02:24:34.999 --> 02:24:45.985]  She's going to give us some information about designer babies as well as today in Austin there was a meeting about fluoride in the water and the Infowars crew was pretty well represented there.
[02:24:46.026 --> 02:24:49.788]  That's still ongoing as far as I understand but she's going to give us an update on what's happening there.
[02:24:50.388 --> 02:24:53.349]  And I'm sure there'll be more news on that tonight on the Nightly News.
[02:24:53.969 --> 02:24:58.291]  And also tomorrow, Alex Jones is going to be talking to Tucker Carlson.
[02:24:58.851 --> 02:25:03.493]  Now, you've probably seen Tucker on many, many different news appearances.
[02:25:03.533 --> 02:25:06.334]  He's been on CNN, MSNBC, Fox, PBS.
[02:25:06.994 --> 02:25:11.555]  He's written for GQ, Esquire New York, and he's the founder and editor of the Daily Caller.
[02:25:12.116 --> 02:25:20.538]  He was excoriated this week because of his comments about what it really means to have freedom in this country as a business owner.
[02:25:21.198 --> 02:25:25.260]  Being able to decide who you want to serve and who you want to not serve.
[02:25:25.300 --> 02:25:32.342]  Now, of course, most business owners aren't going to turn people out, but in some cases where you've got a wedding photographer who doesn't
[02:25:32.992 --> 02:25:36.174]  Want to go to cover a gay wedding?
[02:25:36.834 --> 02:25:38.155]  He ought to have the right to do that.
[02:25:38.275 --> 02:25:44.218]  And if you say that he doesn't have the right to do that, as Tucker Carlson pointed out, that is just nothing but fascism.
[02:25:44.258 --> 02:25:45.899]  That's servitude, that's not freedom.
[02:25:45.979 --> 02:25:54.464]  Exactly, because I believe the instance you're referring to is the gentleman who didn't want to make a wedding cake for a gay couple, and they knew, they expected that going in.
[02:25:54.484 --> 02:26:00.067]  They went to this guy purposely for that purpose, and you know, the shenanigans and all the big things that came out of it.
[02:26:00.327 --> 02:26:01.168]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[02:26:01.228 --> 02:26:10.235]  I mean, they really attacked him in the media for stating what I think is the obvious thing, that if you've got a business, you get to decide who you want to do business with.
[02:26:10.275 --> 02:26:12.357]  I mean, if you cut off everybody, you're going to go out of business.
[02:26:12.437 --> 02:26:16.380]  Any restaurant that says we have the right to refuse service to anybody for whatever reason.
[02:26:16.440 --> 02:26:16.821]  That's right.
[02:26:17.021 --> 02:26:20.404]  It's a private business, and if it's a private business,
[02:26:21.044 --> 02:26:32.787]  Where the people who own it and pay taxes and pay for it and have to meet payroll, if they don't have the freedom to make the decisions about how they want to operate, who they want to operate with, then you've got fascism.
[02:26:32.827 --> 02:26:34.268]  You don't have a free market.
[02:26:34.328 --> 02:26:35.848]  You don't have private property.
[02:26:36.068 --> 02:26:38.229]  You simply have economic fascism.
[02:26:38.509 --> 02:26:42.750]  We have token ownership by private individuals, but you don't have actual ownership.
[02:26:42.790 --> 02:26:43.770]  Now he's going to be on tomorrow.
[02:26:43.790 --> 02:26:48.451]  I don't know what he's going to talk about, but he's going to be on with Alex Jones live in studio.
[02:26:48.471 --> 02:26:49.892]  That's Tucker Carlson tomorrow.
[02:26:50.572 --> 02:26:52.653]  Now we were just talking to Scott in Texas.
[02:26:52.693 --> 02:26:57.935]  He had some questions about foreign troops in American soil and some of these urban warfare drills.
[02:26:58.815 --> 02:27:00.256]  Scott, did you have anything else that you wanted to say?
[02:27:00.296 --> 02:27:06.598]  I wanted to get to Rod in France before we get to the break, but Tucker, did you... Scott, did you have another question?
[02:27:07.379 --> 02:27:12.621]  Yeah, what I really wanted to probe you on is Chinese troops in the U.S.
[02:27:13.701 --> 02:27:16.102]  for purposes under the U.N.
[02:27:17.540 --> 02:27:20.321]  Maybe a national disaster, martial law.
[02:27:22.281 --> 02:27:30.243]  If you were the Chinese and you had 300,000 troops in the United States, how long are you going to play ball with the UN when the time comes to deploy?
[02:27:30.263 --> 02:27:36.564]  Are you going to follow the script or are you going to take advantage of the situation?
[02:27:36.624 --> 02:27:39.165]  What do you think is going on in the minds of the Chinese?
[02:27:39.944 --> 02:27:49.490]  Well, I think it's always important for a government that wants to do things in opposition to their citizens, and we see over and over again that the American government sees the American people as the enemy.
[02:27:49.510 --> 02:27:53.293]  It's always been the pattern that you use people that are not
[02:27:54.366 --> 02:27:54.526]  Yes.
[02:28:12.695 --> 02:28:15.056]  But at the very top, you had a few people controlling that.
[02:28:15.116 --> 02:28:17.278]  But when you have a war, you want just the opposite of that.
[02:28:17.298 --> 02:28:18.498]  You want foreign troops to come in and shoot at the people.
[02:28:18.518 --> 02:28:21.700]  Yeah, you want foreign people to come in, just like we see a lot of times in the drug war in Mexico.
[02:28:21.720 --> 02:28:23.681]  They'll bring various agents from the U.S.
[02:28:23.721 --> 02:28:27.283]  down to Mexico to assist in those drug busts.
[02:28:27.303 --> 02:28:27.823]  Thank you, Scott.
[02:28:27.863 --> 02:28:29.224]  Let's go to Rod in France.
[02:28:29.244 --> 02:28:30.664]  You've been holding for a while from France.
[02:28:30.704 --> 02:28:31.625]  Rod, what do you have to say?
[02:28:31.645 --> 02:28:34.446]  Hi, Dave and Jakari.
[02:28:34.506 --> 02:28:36.047]  It's always good to talk to you guys.
[02:28:36.107 --> 02:28:37.288]  You guys do a great job.
[02:28:37.368 --> 02:28:38.528]  Just want to say start now.
[02:28:38.888 --> 02:28:39.129]  Thank you.
[02:28:41.716 --> 02:28:46.759]  What I wanted to talk about, in fact, was Sandy Hook and Wolfgang Halbig.
[02:28:48.320 --> 02:28:50.341]  Of course, I wish him the very best.
[02:28:50.421 --> 02:28:58.467]  I had the opportunity to listen to his podcast from AFP, and it's extremely interesting.
[02:28:58.607 --> 02:29:04.150]  I mean, the things that this guy has to say, and what's amazing about the story is that
[02:29:05.371 --> 02:29:07.275]  This guy, he obviously knows what he's doing.
[02:29:07.295 --> 02:29:15.951]  I mean, it's his job, and he's gone through all the correct channels to try and get information, and the cover-up just seems extensive.
[02:29:18.081 --> 02:29:30.970]  I just find it extremely disturbing that at the last moment, you notice that he hasn't gotten a lot of coverage as opposed to what I find is a very important story.
[02:29:31.570 --> 02:29:46.420]  And I just find it extremely odd that just before he gets on to InfoWars and gets some massive exposure here with an extremely interesting story that he's had a family emergency and I wish him all the best on that.
[02:29:48.341 --> 02:29:48.822]  Nothing going?
[02:29:49.262 --> 02:29:50.023]  Well, eventually.
[02:29:50.263 --> 02:29:50.863]  Thank you.
[02:29:50.903 --> 02:29:57.889]  We're going to be right back after the break with Leanne McAdoo and we're going to follow this story and we've got a lot of information from Wolfgang.
[02:29:57.989 --> 02:29:59.110]  We hope that it's nothing serious.
[02:29:59.130 --> 02:29:59.990]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.491 --> 02:30:02.092]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.033 --> 02:30:05.695]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:30:18.877 --> 02:30:26.988]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:30:27.268 --> 02:30:31.950]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:30:32.130 --> 02:30:38.853]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:30:38.933 --> 02:30:46.017]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:30:46.097 --> 02:30:52.960]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:30:53.120 --> 02:30:57.484]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[02:32:05.481 --> 02:32:07.402]  We're by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:32:07.543 --> 02:32:10.405]  The facts are in.
[02:32:10.565 --> 02:32:11.706]  The studies are legion.
[02:32:11.966 --> 02:32:19.331]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[02:32:19.491 --> 02:32:22.914]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[02:32:23.294 --> 02:32:23.694]  Simple.
[02:32:23.875 --> 02:32:28.298]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[02:32:28.598 --> 02:32:34.083]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[02:32:34.303 --> 02:32:42.850]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Live Fluoride Shield Formulation, using six of the best documented ingredients.
[02:32:43.030 --> 02:32:43.491]  We're good.
[02:33:13.496 --> 02:33:15.019]  We are on the march.
[02:33:15.380 --> 02:33:17.784]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:33:18.546 --> 02:33:22.252]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:28.624 --> 02:33:30.106]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:30.166 --> 02:33:36.413]  I'm David Knight, filling in for Alex, and I'm joined in the studio with Leanne McAdoo, another member of the Nightly News crew.
[02:33:36.433 --> 02:33:43.561]  And Leanne, you were at the Fluoride meeting in Austin, and we've got a lot of InfoWars crew still down there.
[02:33:43.762 --> 02:33:45.003]  Can you give us a teaser for that?
[02:33:45.043 --> 02:33:46.565]  Because that's going to be coming up on the Nightly News.
[02:33:46.585 --> 02:33:48.147]  We've got a report about what's happening down there.
[02:33:48.627 --> 02:34:01.436]  Well, there were a lot of people that showed up to voice how they felt about the fact that the city of Austin is going to be putting, at the very least, a half a million taxpayer dollars into artificially fluoridating the water supply.
[02:34:01.977 --> 02:34:02.857]  Just amazing to me.
[02:34:03.277 --> 02:34:06.440]  They do this all in the name of taking care of people's teeth.
[02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:11.883]  You know, there's a big difference in topical application of something, even if it were safe and effective.
[02:34:11.903 --> 02:34:16.485]  There's a big difference in the topical application of it and ingesting it internally.
[02:34:16.505 --> 02:34:18.726]  You know, there's warnings against that in toothpaste.
[02:34:19.026 --> 02:34:23.168]  And how do you control the dosage when you just dump it into the water?
[02:34:23.749 --> 02:34:31.433]  A dosage for an adult male is going to be different than it is for a female, for a child, and even for a child that's developing, that's a fetus.
[02:34:32.233 --> 02:34:33.154]  How do you control that?
[02:34:33.194 --> 02:34:35.216]  Well, you can't control that if you just dump it in the water.
[02:34:35.296 --> 02:34:40.961]  It absolutely makes no sense, even for the people who want to try to argue that it's safe and effective, but it isn't safe and effective.
[02:34:41.241 --> 02:34:42.482]  We've seen study after study.
[02:34:43.002 --> 02:34:53.671]  Harvard has had several studies, and the most recent one that they've done, along with some Chinese researchers, is to go back and look at multiple studies and try to quantize
[02:34:54.372 --> 02:35:00.878]  The amount of the IQ dropping in the population to the amount of the fluoride.
[02:35:01.079 --> 02:35:06.784]  So they're trying to make a, you know, if you add this much fluoride to the water, you're going to get this much drop in the IQ.
[02:35:06.824 --> 02:35:09.887]  It's not a question as to whether the IQ is going to drop.
[02:35:09.947 --> 02:35:12.089]  It's just a question as to how much.
[02:35:12.330 --> 02:35:12.770]  Exactly.
[02:35:12.870 --> 02:35:13.831]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[02:35:13.851 --> 02:35:15.333]  And yet they tax us to do this.
[02:35:15.393 --> 02:35:17.855]  They put it in and you can't get these people to stop.
[02:35:17.875 --> 02:35:18.616]  Why do you think that is?
[02:35:19.940 --> 02:35:27.144]  Well, some people there were pretty certain that it's because we're dealing with psychopaths, but, you know, I was... That's an element.
[02:35:27.645 --> 02:35:28.565]  That's definitely an element.
[02:35:28.585 --> 02:35:39.071]  I like to give people the benefit of the doubt and say perhaps they, maybe they just were too busy to actually read the warning label when they signed up to put hydrofluorosilicic acid in the water supply, you know?
[02:35:39.091 --> 02:35:40.592]  Well, there's also the money thing.
[02:35:40.632 --> 02:35:41.573]  We can also follow the money.
[02:35:41.953 --> 02:35:43.414]  And we know that there was a... The library.
[02:35:43.834 --> 02:35:44.175]  Exactly.
[02:35:44.195 --> 02:35:45.275]  There was an abrupt 180.
[02:35:46.676 --> 02:36:01.124]  And the way the medical community looked at fluoridation and fluoride, there was an abrupt 180 when the aluminum industry, past executive of Alcoa, became what was then the equivalent to the head of the FDA.
[02:36:01.564 --> 02:36:08.268]  And then, of course, they doubled down on it when it became a waste product of the nuclear industry after that started.
[02:36:09.128 --> 02:36:17.031]  What we're taking is, we're taking the toxic waste from the aluminum and nuclear industries, and we're paying to dump it into our drinking water.
[02:36:17.051 --> 02:36:22.754]  It'd be bad enough if we paid to dispose it for them, but to have to actually eat it, that's like doubling it down.
[02:36:22.814 --> 02:36:25.355]  It's like, you're not just going to pay for it, we're going to shove it down your throat.
[02:36:25.475 --> 02:36:36.388]  The company that we're purchasing it from, the taxpayers are paying for, it says right on their website, you know, don't put into the lakes, rivers, streams, don't let it leak into the air.
[02:36:36.648 --> 02:36:42.495]  But apparently there's some magic wand or something that they wave here at the city of Austin that makes it safe to drink.
[02:36:42.695 --> 02:36:44.237]  As soon as it goes on water supply, it's great.
[02:36:44.257 --> 02:36:45.418]  And back in Raleigh we had
[02:36:46.039 --> 02:36:55.241]  We had some people who had met up on Planet Info Wars, and they wanted to do activism for freedom and liberty there, and the first thing they picked was fluoride.
[02:36:55.261 --> 02:37:01.803]  They go down and talk to the Raleigh City Council, and the Raleigh City Council just picks up their glasses and toasts them and says, yeah, we're going to keep doing it.
[02:37:03.123 --> 02:37:06.844]  It's just amazing the arrogance, the stupidity, and the corruption that's going on.
[02:37:07.124 --> 02:37:08.625]  But you want to talk about something else, too.
[02:37:08.665 --> 02:37:12.706]  You want to talk about a story that you've been following on the nightly news about designer babies.
[02:37:13.208 --> 02:37:16.710]  Right, yeah, Bloomberg actually reported that the U.S.
[02:37:16.750 --> 02:37:25.937]  regulators are now kind of weighing the safety of this new technology that it hopes to eliminate genetic diseases in newborns.
[02:37:26.377 --> 02:37:40.826]  So they've done this before where they've already taken like a fertilized egg or something, but now they're actually going to be taking the DNA from one dad and two mothers to create a disease-free child.
[02:37:42.107 --> 02:37:42.888]  Disease-free.
[02:37:43.228 --> 02:37:44.109]  Yeah, they hope.
[02:37:44.189 --> 02:37:45.070]  Fingers crossed.
[02:37:45.610 --> 02:37:54.097]  If they understand everything about DNA, which we ought to be pretty skeptical about that, since it wasn't very long ago that they were saying, yeah, you know, most of that... Junk DNA.
[02:37:54.137 --> 02:37:59.181]  Yeah, most of that's junk DNA, and then it's like a few years later, well, you know, we just figured out what that's for, and it's no longer junk.
[02:37:59.221 --> 02:38:00.342]  It's like, these are the guys!
[02:38:02.405 --> 02:38:05.230]  Yeah, we're not building pianos here, just nail these two boards together.
[02:38:05.271 --> 02:38:11.903]  I mean, it's kind of, it's very frightening to see them do that, and of course the FDA is involved in that because...
[02:38:13.135 --> 02:38:15.316]  They see us as agricultural products or what?
[02:38:15.336 --> 02:38:16.817]  I mean, it's the drug side of it, I guess.
[02:38:16.837 --> 02:38:17.037]  Exactly.
[02:38:17.057 --> 02:38:18.658]  We're a biological product.
[02:38:20.299 --> 02:38:22.040]  Here, they've done this procedure before.
[02:38:22.320 --> 02:38:29.084]  In 1997 to 2003, there were about 30 children that were born with this same sort of technique.
[02:38:29.445 --> 02:38:32.987]  And then the FDA came in and said, this is a biological product.
[02:38:33.487 --> 02:38:34.548]  We can regulate it.
[02:38:34.888 --> 02:38:37.690]  And so they shut the program down for using it to
[02:38:38.650 --> 02:38:40.551]  Create humans, basically.
[02:38:40.972 --> 02:38:47.497]  So here this kind of ties in to the young lady, the young girl that's been put in foster care at the Boston Children's Hospital.
[02:38:47.517 --> 02:38:48.878]  Yeah, we were talking about that during the break.
[02:38:49.038 --> 02:38:59.025]  What she's suffering from is a defective... The mitochondrial disease, which is the exact disease that this technique here is attempting to eradicate.
[02:38:59.465 --> 02:39:06.010]  So here we're seeing where the government is stepping in and saying in these hospitals they're taking these children away who have this disease.
[02:39:06.250 --> 02:39:06.871]  They're already
[02:39:07.691 --> 02:39:08.931]  Taking the parent out of it.
[02:39:09.312 --> 02:39:11.612]  Actually, the hospital calls it a parent-ectomy.
[02:39:13.113 --> 02:39:13.393]  Really?
[02:39:13.553 --> 02:39:13.793]  Yeah.
[02:39:14.033 --> 02:39:14.373]  Really?
[02:39:14.493 --> 02:39:15.094]  Yeah.
[02:39:15.174 --> 02:39:15.454]  Wow.
[02:39:15.494 --> 02:39:16.674]  That's their little pet name for it.
[02:39:16.694 --> 02:39:16.914]  That's cold.
[02:39:17.174 --> 02:39:17.634]  Exactly.
[02:39:17.974 --> 02:39:24.477]  Yeah, I mean, you've got one well-respected hospital called Tufts that says that that's a physical condition.
[02:39:25.157 --> 02:39:27.958]  And then you've got another one that says it's simply a psychological condition.
[02:39:27.998 --> 02:39:30.999]  The parents are seeing her condition deteriorating rapidly.
[02:39:31.059 --> 02:39:34.260]  They believe that it is a physical condition, but the government
[02:39:34.995 --> 02:39:35.455]  Steps in.
[02:39:35.495 --> 02:39:38.536]  The judge steps in and says, you're not going to make that decision about your child.
[02:39:38.977 --> 02:39:40.877]  We're going to make that decision about your child.
[02:39:41.297 --> 02:39:44.039]  We know your child better than you do.
[02:39:44.499 --> 02:39:47.440]  We have the interest of your child better than you do.
[02:39:47.580 --> 02:39:50.101]  And oh, by the way, you can't even talk to the media about it.
[02:39:50.121 --> 02:39:52.102]  If you do, we're going to slap you with a contempt charge.
[02:39:52.282 --> 02:39:52.962]  Right.
[02:39:53.102 --> 02:39:54.523]  Absolutely amazing.
[02:39:54.563 --> 02:39:55.383]  But that's where they're headed.
[02:39:55.973 --> 02:40:16.763]  Right, and it just shows how much power the Children's Hospital has, because these people have been treating their daughter for this disease for many, many years, and then just a year ago she gets diagnosed with this different mental disorder, somatoform disorder, and they say, oh, that's what she's got, and now you need to stop giving her medication for that, and you're over-medicating her.
[02:40:16.783 --> 02:40:18.904]  This is a very, very important
[02:40:19.964 --> 02:40:24.687]  ...case right here, because it brings together several different factors that we see happening.
[02:40:25.347 --> 02:40:32.412]  And if you don't think this is going to happen more and more frequently with Obamacare, once the government is paying for your healthcare...
[02:40:33.208 --> 02:40:35.370]  They are going to be making the decisions about it.
[02:40:35.550 --> 02:40:37.371]  And we've already seen them making the decisions about it.
[02:40:37.391 --> 02:40:45.477]  We already see them dictating to people how much coverage you're going to have, what's going to be covered, forcing you to buy coverage for things that you can't use.
[02:40:45.737 --> 02:40:48.960]  Single men having to buy maternity care, for example.
[02:40:49.380 --> 02:40:56.005]  And that's why people's insurance rates are skyrocketing by a factor of two, by a factor of five in many cases, why they're losing their insurance.
[02:40:57.706 --> 02:41:03.250]  And it's because this has been written by the insurance company, as Alex has said from the very beginning.
[02:41:03.691 --> 02:41:07.814]  This is not something that is going to make health care more affordable, more accessible.
[02:41:07.934 --> 02:41:13.078]  It's going to make it more expensive and more profitable for the health insurance companies.
[02:41:13.138 --> 02:41:15.619]  It's not going to give us more access to it, but what it will do
[02:41:16.480 --> 02:41:32.735]  Is it will give the government a stranglehold on the health care situation, denying people health care, taking children away from families as we see happening here in this case in Boston, and perhaps if you don't get all your vaccines, then maybe you don't get any health care.
[02:41:33.191 --> 02:41:36.374]  Right, well that's the issue here with these designer babies.
[02:41:36.434 --> 02:41:43.480]  If you're, you know, someone out there who's thinking that this might be a good idea for you, the FDA has already said that this is something that they can regulate.
[02:41:43.540 --> 02:41:45.302]  It's a biological product.
[02:41:45.762 --> 02:41:49.946]  So who's to say that they're gonna, you know, if you decide that
[02:41:50.586 --> 02:41:53.708]  You want to take care of this biological product a certain way.
[02:41:54.169 --> 02:41:59.113]  If they don't agree with that, they can swoop in and say, well, this is what we regulate.
[02:41:59.153 --> 02:42:03.336]  This person is, I mean, do they have the same classification as, you know, a human?
[02:42:03.996 --> 02:42:07.919]  And we see how they treat children and parents now who aren't.
[02:42:08.320 --> 02:42:11.082]  Well, you know, we look at these things over and over again.
[02:42:11.102 --> 02:42:14.404]  It doesn't matter what aspect of your life it is, whether it is
[02:42:15.285 --> 02:42:17.107]  Making health care decisions about your child.
[02:42:17.627 --> 02:42:20.430]  Deciding what kind of food you want to eat.
[02:42:20.930 --> 02:42:29.679]  You can't have raw milk, you can't have organic food because we're going to put those guys out of business because we have politically connected big agricultural firms.
[02:42:30.279 --> 02:42:36.723]  We're going to make GMO legal in the United States when it's banned in country after country.
[02:42:36.803 --> 02:42:38.564]  And fluoride is another example of it.
[02:42:38.744 --> 02:42:40.486]  They're going to dump whatever they want to in our water.
[02:42:40.726 --> 02:42:45.929]  They're going to tell us what we can do with our business, with our families, with our food, with our medicine.
[02:42:46.289 --> 02:42:51.993]  We are their slaves and they're going to tell us whatever is in their best interest so they don't care what we think.
[02:42:52.133 --> 02:42:53.694]  We don't get to make those decisions anymore.
[02:42:53.934 --> 02:42:54.515]  Oh, exactly.
[02:42:54.575 --> 02:42:57.297]  And that's today when we were down at City Hall.
[02:42:57.417 --> 02:42:58.258]  Perfect example.
[02:42:58.778 --> 02:43:05.885]  You know, there's hundreds of people in there today and, you know, people are going presenting their line item, talking, you know, to City Council.
[02:43:06.205 --> 02:43:08.007]  They leave once theirs is addressed.
[02:43:08.407 --> 02:43:16.975]  Once it comes time for the general public to speak to the godly City Council, all these police moved in to the room and kind of
[02:43:17.455 --> 02:43:29.883]  I sat up at different exits and it was just so like, oh, we need to make sure that the slaves don't get out of hand expressing their First Amendment right to their elected officials that they put into those seats.
[02:43:30.223 --> 02:43:43.391]  Well you're lucky they just didn't send you down to a quote-unquote free speech zone like they do at the political conventions where they take anybody who has something to say which is specifically protected speech under the First Amendment
[02:43:44.011 --> 02:43:48.214]  They send people down and away from the conventions, put them in cages.
[02:43:48.314 --> 02:43:50.415]  I mean, it's absolutely ridiculous.
[02:43:50.435 --> 02:43:55.018]  Anybody that thinks... You know, when I was growing up, people used to say, you know, what do you want me to do?
[02:43:55.118 --> 02:43:55.879]  Oh, it's a free country.
[02:43:55.899 --> 02:43:56.239]  Do what you want.
[02:43:56.279 --> 02:43:57.720]  You never hear anybody say that anymore.
[02:43:58.301 --> 02:44:01.723]  Everybody knows deep down it is not a free country.
[02:44:02.303 --> 02:44:03.124]  We don't have freedom.
[02:44:03.144 --> 02:44:05.786]  That's why we talk about it so much, as some Europeans have pointed out.
[02:44:05.806 --> 02:44:06.186]  Shut up.
[02:44:06.266 --> 02:44:06.766]  That's right.
[02:44:07.407 --> 02:44:07.767]  That's right.
[02:44:07.967 --> 02:44:16.790]  Well, the issue here that goes on with these designer babies, they have no idea what the permanent change is going to be when they start messing with the human genome.
[02:44:17.350 --> 02:44:27.753]  And so far they've just tested this on mice and already the mice are showing that they are having breathing problems as well as reduced learning and exploring capabilities.
[02:44:28.433 --> 02:44:35.675]  And so this research, of course, suggests that they don't know what's going to happen when they replace one mitochondrial strain with another.
[02:44:36.675 --> 02:44:37.536]  They just don't know.
[02:44:37.556 --> 02:44:48.521]  And so basically now you're dealing with, you have taken it upon yourself to do this to your child who had no say about whether they wanted to be a genetically modified human.
[02:44:49.222 --> 02:44:59.847]  And now, you know, generation after generation, whatever they have, whatever kind of diseases they may produce as a result is going to continue to be passed down.
[02:45:00.527 --> 02:45:01.448]  So there's no... That's amazing.
[02:45:02.248 --> 02:45:05.593]  And you know, we've seen this with genetically modified crops.
[02:45:05.673 --> 02:45:05.893]  Right.
[02:45:06.013 --> 02:45:16.046]  When they, the French study, where they showed the massive tumors on the rats, very, just an amazing picture, and yet they pushed back on that and they said, you picked
[02:45:16.909 --> 02:45:21.751]  A strain of rats that are prone to tumors and you didn't uh... what was it?
[02:45:21.811 --> 02:45:22.652]  The number of them, right?
[02:45:23.092 --> 02:45:33.117]  And it turns out that Monsanto used exactly the same strain of rats and exactly the same number of rats but Monsanto didn't run the study very long.
[02:45:33.237 --> 02:45:36.138]  Monsanto cut off like one or two, three months or something like that.
[02:45:36.158 --> 02:45:37.499]  These people ran it for about a year.
[02:45:37.519 --> 02:45:38.099]  Two years.
[02:45:38.419 --> 02:45:39.360]  Two years, yeah.
[02:45:39.480 --> 02:45:41.641]  And the rats break out in these massive tumors
[02:45:42.341 --> 02:45:46.546]  This is the way they can skew these things to get whatever results they want.
[02:45:47.006 --> 02:45:54.134]  We heard that pushback, but we didn't hear what the actual study was that proved to the FDA's satisfaction that it was safe.
[02:45:54.395 --> 02:45:54.795]  Exactly.
[02:45:54.855 --> 02:45:56.377]  And it was Monsanto's study.
[02:45:56.397 --> 02:45:57.478]  Yes, exactly.
[02:45:57.498 --> 02:45:58.519]  So they do their own study.
[02:45:58.619 --> 02:46:00.522]  Arms reach study there.
[02:46:01.388 --> 02:46:08.230]  It's a very scary thing when you look at this, and you know, sometimes we have people will contact us and say, what's the big deal?
[02:46:08.750 --> 02:46:11.811]  We've been genetically modifying animals for quite some time.
[02:46:12.011 --> 02:46:20.554]  Well, it is a very big deal because that's not, when you selectively breed animals, that is not the same thing as transgenic
[02:46:21.354 --> 02:46:23.435]  genetic modification, which is what they're doing.
[02:46:23.955 --> 02:46:34.841]  You can go in and you can selectively breed animals, and we've seen that happen with livestock, we've seen that happen with dogs, and you can get quite a bit of variation just by selective breeding within the DNA.
[02:46:35.261 --> 02:46:39.743]  You can then also go into what's called cisgenic genetic modification.
[02:46:39.763 --> 02:46:46.687]  You can actually directly modify the DNA of these animals, and that's kind of dodgy, okay?
[02:46:47.027 --> 02:46:50.049]  That's got a lot of question marks about that, but the transgenic
[02:46:50.709 --> 02:46:54.210]  It's when you take DNA from completely different organisms.
[02:46:54.251 --> 02:46:55.411]  That would never breed normally.
[02:46:55.431 --> 02:46:58.572]  Yeah, you take some DNA from a plant and you put it into an animal.
[02:46:58.772 --> 02:47:03.634]  Or, you know, you cross this with that and, you know... The spiders with the goat's milk.
[02:47:03.874 --> 02:47:04.415]  Exactly.
[02:47:04.475 --> 02:47:05.915]  You get crazy.
[02:47:06.155 --> 02:47:09.097]  That's when you get your Frankenstein animals, your frankenfood.
[02:47:09.457 --> 02:47:12.578]  And that's really where we don't know where this is happening.
[02:47:12.938 --> 02:47:15.279]  And yet, what is the FDA's concern?
[02:47:15.579 --> 02:47:18.881]  The FDA's concern is to shut down heritage
[02:47:19.929 --> 02:47:27.791]  Farmers, to shut down organic farmers, to curtail farming practices that have fed humans for millennia.
[02:47:27.811 --> 02:47:28.231]  Right.
[02:47:28.331 --> 02:47:43.615]  They want to shut that down, put all of our eggs in one basket, this new frankenfood, genetically modified, corporate, factory-produced fertilizer stuff, that's where they want all of our eggs to be, and that one thing, that's a very, very dangerous thing.
[02:47:43.775 --> 02:47:54.682]  It's very dangerous and it kind of falls into the whole eugenics plan because we see with the rat studies, genetically modified foods makes the third generation, they're sterile.
[02:47:54.902 --> 02:47:56.503]  They can no longer reproduce.
[02:47:57.023 --> 02:47:59.825]  And so this is happening with humans.
[02:48:00.345 --> 02:48:13.033]  So if you're sitting here messing now with the human genome, what is to say that you're not creating a totally different species of human in a generation from now or sterile humans that can no longer reproduce?
[02:48:13.433 --> 02:48:17.494]  And who's to say that that isn't their real agenda, bottom line, anyway?
[02:48:17.774 --> 02:48:20.255]  Alex has pointed that out over and over again.
[02:48:20.275 --> 02:48:24.457]  That that's what many of them have been saying for a long time is exactly their agenda.
[02:48:24.977 --> 02:48:28.518]  To do a soft kill, to do a sterilization, to do a population culling.
[02:48:28.938 --> 02:48:31.219]  You've got, uh, they openly talk about it.
[02:48:31.639 --> 02:48:42.946]  People who are in charge of the media, the people who've set up these Georgia Guidestones, the Ted Turners, that they desperately, desperately want to get rid of most, if not all the humans.
[02:48:43.046 --> 02:48:50.711]  I mean, you have this whole Gaia movement that was absolutely crazy that saw human beings as a virus on the planet that had to be stamped out.
[02:48:51.171 --> 02:48:54.333]  That's really what I think is behind this, and I think a lot of these scientists
[02:48:54.853 --> 02:48:55.813]  Do know what they're doing.
[02:48:55.873 --> 02:49:17.178]  I don't, again, you know, we talk about is it a question of incompetence and mistakes or is it just outright evil what they're doing and, you know, when they say that they're going to cull the population and then you have them doing things that are going to result in sterilization in a couple of generations that we've seen happen over and over again in animal studies, maybe that's just their plan.
[02:49:17.543 --> 02:49:17.763]  Right.
[02:49:17.803 --> 02:49:20.904]  It's a safe and effective way to slow kill.
[02:49:21.145 --> 02:49:21.605]  That's right.
[02:49:21.625 --> 02:49:22.305]  That's right.
[02:49:22.325 --> 02:49:24.306]  You want to take a call on small farmers?
[02:49:24.326 --> 02:49:26.087]  We've got Casey in South Carolina.
[02:49:26.107 --> 02:49:27.467]  He's been on the phone for a while.
[02:49:27.507 --> 02:49:28.808]  Casey, what do you think about this?
[02:49:29.528 --> 02:49:29.988]  Hi, David.
[02:49:30.008 --> 02:49:30.449]  Hi, Leanne.
[02:49:30.489 --> 02:49:31.329]  How are you two today?
[02:49:31.509 --> 02:49:31.689]  Hello.
[02:49:31.709 --> 02:49:32.149]  Doing good.
[02:49:32.209 --> 02:49:32.509]  How are you?
[02:49:32.830 --> 02:49:33.390]  Doing real well.
[02:49:33.470 --> 02:49:41.913]  I'm kind of concerned specifically about Codex Alimentarius and how it plays in exactly to what you were just talking about with the culling of the population.
[02:49:41.933 --> 02:49:45.215]  I also feel it ties in with Obamacare and food rationing.
[02:49:46.402 --> 02:49:47.683]  Any thoughts on that from you all?
[02:49:48.504 --> 02:49:49.304]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:49:49.884 --> 02:49:54.807]  As we were talking, when I was talking to Paul Joseph Watson, he pointed out that they can see this stuff coming.
[02:49:55.067 --> 02:49:58.349]  They know and they see that there's a food shortage coming.
[02:49:58.389 --> 02:49:59.770]  They see food prices spiking.
[02:50:00.090 --> 02:50:01.651]  We have that happening in the United States now.
[02:50:02.032 --> 02:50:09.256]  They know that when food is becoming scarce, they know that there's going to be civil unrest that's going to follow as a result.
[02:50:09.816 --> 02:50:11.477]  I think it is all part of their plan.
[02:50:11.497 --> 02:50:16.039]  I think that they're doing things that absolutely make no sense.
[02:50:16.800 --> 02:50:25.904]  And so you have to say they can't really be that stupid, especially when they've got documents saying that their plan is to cull the population, their plan is to cut back the food supply.
[02:50:26.404 --> 02:50:29.646]  When you start seeing this stuff happening, it's not necessarily incompetence.
[02:50:30.051 --> 02:50:41.613]  Right, and they've had these plans for hundreds of years, so they've got their bloodlines or whatever, have no problem continuing to carry on this reality that they see for themselves, you know, the singularity.
[02:50:41.973 --> 02:50:46.734]  Yeah, the guy who came up with the term genocide pointed out the four steps that happened in the Ukraine.
[02:50:46.774 --> 02:50:47.514]  I mentioned it before.
[02:50:47.874 --> 02:50:54.636]  Cut out the political leadership, co-opt the churches, bring in massive immigration, and cut off their food.
[02:50:54.676 --> 02:50:56.716]  We've seen this happen over and over again.
[02:50:57.356 --> 02:51:05.505]  It's a pattern for control, a pattern for tyranny, and it's been executed very well by Stalin, and now it's starting to come around to us.
[02:51:05.525 --> 02:51:06.205]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:06.245 --> 02:51:06.846]  Stay tuned.

[02:52:43.691 --> 02:52:44.872]  Let's ask Thomas Baldrick.
[02:52:46.121 --> 02:52:48.504]  Thomas, talk about customer service at GCN.
[02:52:48.584 --> 02:52:52.888]  GCN is extraordinary in how they take care of their customers.
[02:52:53.108 --> 02:52:59.214]  The bottom line, Freeze Dry Guy keeps advertising on GCN because it works.
[02:52:59.575 --> 02:53:03.498]  If you'd like to experience unbelievable customer service, call Lee Wickenhauser at 877-996-4327, extension 107.
[02:53:08.325 --> 02:53:11.626]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[02:53:11.726 --> 02:53:13.947]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:53:14.147 --> 02:53:22.369]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[02:53:22.669 --> 02:53:32.772]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[02:53:33.152 --> 02:53:46.456]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency, Super Mel Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:53:46.876 --> 02:53:52.938]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:53:53.158 --> 02:54:01.720]  For a limited time, we are offering 15% off Super Mel Vitality at InfoWarsLife.com to introduce you to this powerful supplement.

[02:54:21.092 --> 02:54:22.392]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:22.432 --> 02:54:23.653]  I'm David Knight filling in for Alex.
[02:54:23.673 --> 02:54:26.893]  I'm joined here in studio with Leanne McAdoo, also of the Nightly News.
[02:54:27.713 --> 02:54:33.895]  And we were just talking before the break about fluoride, we're talking about genetic modification, the attack on the family farms.
[02:54:33.915 --> 02:54:39.236]  You know, ultimately, ultimately, you're responsible for yourself and for your family.
[02:54:39.296 --> 02:54:43.657]  You have to do things to take care of your health, to take care of your family's health.
[02:54:44.597 --> 02:54:47.939]  And take a look at the products we've got at Infowarslife.com.
[02:54:47.979 --> 02:54:49.140]  It's a win-win situation.
[02:54:49.160 --> 02:54:57.304]  How we support this operation here is how you can help your family do something good for yourself, do something good for your family, and help the operation here.
[02:54:57.344 --> 02:54:59.405]  We've got water filters to get the fluoride out.
[02:54:59.485 --> 02:55:01.106]  We've got heritage seeds.
[02:55:01.206 --> 02:55:04.027]  We've got iodine survival shield.
[02:55:04.067 --> 02:55:04.468]  We've got
[02:55:05.748 --> 02:55:10.771]  All kinds of products there as well as some t-shirts where you can help spread the news.
[02:55:10.871 --> 02:55:11.212]  Yes.
[02:55:11.272 --> 02:55:19.957]  Leanne has been modeling the Mulan Labe t-shirt and we got a nice design for that, both a male and a female cut design.
[02:55:19.977 --> 02:55:28.842]  We got a lady's shirt there and it's a good way to get the message out about the fact that we have a right to defend ourselves.
[02:55:29.502 --> 02:55:37.023]  We have a right to feed ourselves, we have a right to defend ourselves, and so we hope that you will take a look at those when you're thinking about how you're going to...
[02:55:38.157 --> 02:55:39.338]  Make yourself self-reliant.
[02:55:39.398 --> 02:55:46.181]  We have a lot of products there and that would help the operation if you go to Infowarslife.com and look at our store there.
[02:55:46.201 --> 02:55:47.702]  How about that t-shirt?
[02:55:47.722 --> 02:55:48.462]  You like that t-shirt?
[02:55:48.782 --> 02:55:49.122]  I do.
[02:55:49.262 --> 02:55:50.143]  I helped them.
[02:55:50.183 --> 02:55:55.866]  They were kind of going back and forth between doing the gold foil for the females and I gave it a thumbs up.
[02:55:56.066 --> 02:55:57.046]  It's a great design.
[02:55:57.066 --> 02:55:59.627]  It's pretty sharp with the Spartan helmets and it's sparkly.
[02:55:59.907 --> 02:56:04.670]  It is a great design and you know it's a reminder that nobody ever gives you your freedom.
[02:56:05.350 --> 02:56:06.834]  The Spartans had to fight for it.
[02:56:07.495 --> 02:56:12.989]  The Texans had to fight for it, as Alex pointed out to Piers Morgan, the former host at CNN.
[02:56:14.258 --> 02:56:19.243]  But, you know, it wasn't a Mexican-American thing at the Alamo.
[02:56:20.144 --> 02:56:25.430]  Pretty much every Mexican territory rebelled against Santa Ana.
[02:56:25.470 --> 02:56:26.231]  He was a tyrant.
[02:56:26.851 --> 02:56:28.113]  He had thrown out the Constitution.
[02:56:28.433 --> 02:56:29.614]  He was rewriting the laws.
[02:56:29.654 --> 02:56:33.598]  He was doing whatever he wanted to, like somebody else I know that's in power right now.
[02:56:34.199 --> 02:56:36.341]  And three of those seven
[02:56:37.522 --> 02:56:39.323]  Uh, areas that rebelled against Santa Ana.
[02:56:39.363 --> 02:56:41.564]  Three of them created governments of their own.
[02:56:41.624 --> 02:56:42.444]  Texas was one of them.
[02:56:42.504 --> 02:56:52.989]  Texas was the only one that got its independence, but it was Americans, it was Hispanic, people, people who had immigrated in from America, they fought side by side to end tyranny.
[02:56:53.289 --> 02:57:01.253]  And, you know, I think it's kind of interesting that you've got this vigilante group down in Mexico now taking back their area from the corrupt
[02:57:01.753 --> 02:57:07.857]  Police, the corrupt federales, and the drug lords that were working with the federal government down there.
[02:57:07.897 --> 02:57:14.201]  I think it's ultimately, it comes down to you've got to be able to provide for your own defense.
[02:57:14.241 --> 02:57:17.303]  And that's what the people down there in that Mexican province are doing right now.
[02:57:17.343 --> 02:57:20.405]  That vigilante group, they're taking it back from that drug group called the Knights Templar.
[02:57:21.266 --> 02:57:32.954]  But you were just telling me in the break that Leanne and the InfoWars crew were down at City Hall today, and they were talking about fluoride, and so we were there to give them our perspective on it.
[02:57:32.974 --> 02:57:40.059]  We still have crew that's down there, and you'll be able to catch that on the nightly news, but you were saying that they were talking about urban forests.
[02:57:40.299 --> 02:57:41.200]  Tell us about this one.
[02:57:41.420 --> 02:57:48.382]  Right, well that's why, you know, it is so important for people to go to these City Hall meetings, to go voice your opinion.
[02:57:48.783 --> 02:57:54.645]  I mean, even if you just walk in and go on the little computer and vote to put your opinion that you're for or against something.
[02:57:55.125 --> 02:58:02.767]  It's so important because these people are sitting down there today working on their Agenda 21 Master Plan.
[02:58:03.007 --> 02:58:06.069]  So they're down there today, we're just, we were befuddled.
[02:58:06.209 --> 02:58:09.750]  It's their Imagine Austin Plan and they were talking about
[02:58:10.370 --> 02:58:12.071]  Urban forestry, which is great.
[02:58:12.111 --> 02:58:19.694]  You know, I love trees downtown, but one of the snafus they had was trees on private property.
[02:58:19.714 --> 02:58:21.795]  How do we take over that?
[02:58:21.935 --> 02:58:24.916]  The private property for their urban forest.
[02:58:24.996 --> 02:58:27.257]  See, there isn't any private property.
[02:58:27.657 --> 02:58:28.978]  There isn't any privacy.
[02:58:28.998 --> 02:58:35.280]  Hang on, I've got a couple of callers that have been waiting for a long time and I'm gonna come back right after the break and we're gonna talk to them.
[02:58:35.321 --> 02:58:38.122]  They've been waiting for quite a while to talk and we'll be right back.
[02:58:38.282 --> 02:58:38.602]  Stay tuned.
[02:58:50.282 --> 02:58:52.127]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:58:59.631 --> 02:59:02.212]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:59:02.452 --> 02:59:07.333]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:59:07.593 --> 02:59:15.456]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:59:15.716 --> 02:59:20.017]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:59:20.237 --> 02:59:24.058]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:59:24.198 --> 02:59:29.903]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:59:30.163 --> 02:59:32.925]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:59:33.326 --> 02:59:38.550]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[02:59:38.690 --> 02:59:46.837]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[03:00:00.569 --> 03:00:01.730]  Coast to Coast.
[03:00:02.111 --> 03:00:03.432]  Direct from Austin.
[03:00:04.153 --> 03:00:07.376]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:14.537 --> 03:00:18.702]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:19.363 --> 03:00:20.164]  You want answers?
[03:00:20.945 --> 03:00:21.866]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:22.507 --> 03:00:26.131]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:26.692 --> 03:00:30.757]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:34.218 --> 03:00:35.679]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:35.739 --> 03:00:40.684]  I'm David Knight, subbing for Alex in this Overdrive, and I'm joined here in the studio with Leanne McAdoo.
[03:00:41.244 --> 03:00:44.027]  And we just wanted to clear out a few of the callers who've been waiting for a while.
[03:00:44.047 --> 03:00:47.950]  I got Bill in Georgia, Eric in Tennessee, Rocco in North Carolina, Kevin in Georgia.
[03:00:47.990 --> 03:00:49.572]  I'm going to just limit it to those.
[03:00:49.592 --> 03:00:51.373]  I don't know if we can get through that in this segment here.
[03:00:51.413 --> 03:00:53.075]  We're going to try to go through fairly quickly.
[03:00:53.976 --> 03:00:55.577]  Bill in Georgia, what's on your mind?
[03:00:58.079 --> 03:00:58.380]  Hello.
[03:01:00.444 --> 03:01:02.685]  Okay, let's go to Eric in Tennessee.
[03:01:03.045 --> 03:01:04.006]  Eric, what's on your mind?
[03:01:04.026 --> 03:01:06.427]  David Leehan?
[03:01:07.848 --> 03:01:08.909]  David Leehan, are you there?
[03:01:09.109 --> 03:01:09.609]  Yep, we're there.
[03:01:09.629 --> 03:01:10.109]  How are you doing?
[03:01:10.489 --> 03:01:11.990]  Alright, doing well, doing well.
[03:01:12.010 --> 03:01:13.671]  Glad to hear you guys today.
[03:01:13.711 --> 03:01:16.032]  You always do an excellent job when Alex is away.
[03:01:16.293 --> 03:01:17.653]  Thank you.
[03:01:18.614 --> 03:01:29.780]  The thing that really gets me, people are always crying in their milk about how their kids are taken in and how this and that is going on and how the state steps in.
[03:01:30.543 --> 03:01:38.912]  People forget that that birth certificate that they sign when they have the kid in the hospital pretty much puts them in state custody from day one.
[03:01:39.773 --> 03:01:42.315]  So, I mean, you know, we're a debtor nation.
[03:01:42.355 --> 03:01:47.401]  They own us from the time that we're born until the time that we die and they sign that death certificate.
[03:01:49.263 --> 03:01:53.227]  You know, if people realize that more than they do, I think that
[03:01:53.874 --> 03:01:55.815]  It would change a lot quicker in this country.
[03:01:56.035 --> 03:01:56.936]  Yeah, very good point.
[03:01:57.416 --> 03:02:01.779]  And they've had court decisions where people have complaints, especially in Massachusetts.
[03:02:01.819 --> 03:02:13.506]  I think it was at a school where a parent was concerned about what his children were being taught in school and they said, hey, you know, when you bring your child to the school and turn them over, you've abandoned your child to the state.
[03:02:13.526 --> 03:02:17.088]  I mean, we need to start rolling these things back and people need to understand
[03:02:17.848 --> 03:02:22.550]  Really, what the true perspective of the state is towards us, they really do believe that they own us.
[03:02:22.610 --> 03:02:25.851]  And we need to reassert the fact that they don't, and it's an educational issue.
[03:02:26.551 --> 03:02:27.611]  Thank you very much, Eric.
[03:02:27.691 --> 03:02:32.113]  Let's go to, I want to try to get through as many calls as we can, let's go to Rocco in North Carolina.
[03:02:32.993 --> 03:02:33.834]  Hey, David, thanks.
[03:02:34.174 --> 03:02:34.354]  Hey.
[03:02:35.114 --> 03:02:43.437]  I've been really amazed how all across the board, no one's really covering in detail the plans for this Article 5 Convention.
[03:02:43.908 --> 03:02:47.910]  There's so many players and divergent groups coming into play.
[03:02:47.970 --> 03:02:54.292]  You have the Convention of States people, Glenn Benkrup on board, Mark Levin, Rob Nadelson.
[03:02:54.752 --> 03:02:56.333]  That's not a solution.
[03:02:56.713 --> 03:02:58.053]  You know what the problem is?
[03:02:58.073 --> 03:02:59.514]  The problem is not our Constitution.
[03:03:00.054 --> 03:03:06.218]  The problem is we've got a gang of criminals who are running our government who don't pay any attention to the Constitution or their oath to it.
[03:03:06.298 --> 03:03:07.159]  That's the real problem.
[03:03:07.179 --> 03:03:18.085]  And unless we get that changed, a Constitutional Convention, as far as I can see, can only make things worse because if they don't obey the law now, what makes you think if you had a better law they would obey that?
[03:03:18.146 --> 03:03:24.349]  But of course they can always come in and give themselves legal cover to remove the restrictions that they currently have.
[03:03:24.369 --> 03:03:25.030]  Is that your take on it?
[03:03:25.859 --> 03:03:26.339]  Absolutely.
[03:03:26.539 --> 03:03:28.220]  The logical fallacies are clear.
[03:03:28.260 --> 03:03:29.221]  I completely agree with you.
[03:03:29.301 --> 03:03:34.363]  Not only would you be trusting the current occupants of Congress and the state legislators.
[03:03:34.723 --> 03:03:37.325]  Allegedly, there's two huge logical fallacies.
[03:03:37.365 --> 03:03:44.308]  Number one, you're trusting these people, both breakers, to present good amendments.
[03:03:44.388 --> 03:03:48.690]  And then even if they did, which would be, yeah, it would be hard to believe that would happen.
[03:03:48.950 --> 03:03:52.692]  Then you're going to trust them in Congress to obey the new amendments.
[03:03:54.712 --> 03:04:04.414]  Oh yeah, absolutely, I agree with you.
[03:04:05.134 --> 03:04:13.636]  It's absolutely insane to think that these people would have the integrity to change something, but you know, once they pay attention to that, once the jurisdictions of Washington, D.C.
[03:04:13.656 --> 03:04:20.078]  and Chicago start paying attention to Supreme Court decisions on the Second Amendment as well as to the Constitution, then I'll agree that maybe they've got something there.
[03:04:20.118 --> 03:04:21.778]  Let's go to Kevin in Georgia.
[03:04:24.335 --> 03:04:24.936]  Hey, how you doing?
[03:04:24.956 --> 03:04:25.536]  What's on your mind?
[03:04:27.038 --> 03:04:28.399]  Yeah, about solutions.
[03:04:28.439 --> 03:04:31.141]  Do you know anything about John Deresh?
[03:04:32.082 --> 03:04:32.763]  No, I don't.
[03:04:32.803 --> 03:04:34.004]  I've only got about 20 seconds.
[03:04:34.044 --> 03:04:36.947]  I'm sorry to cut you short, but yeah, tell me real quickly what you want to say.
[03:04:37.734 --> 03:04:38.414]  Talk about it.
[03:04:38.514 --> 03:04:40.035]  NationalLibertyAlliance.org.
[03:04:40.075 --> 03:04:42.196]  He wants to bring back the common law grand jury.
[03:04:43.277 --> 03:04:45.018]  That would straighten out all our problems.
[03:04:45.038 --> 03:04:47.219]  Oh yes, our juries are a mess.
[03:04:47.259 --> 03:04:49.600]  Also look at the Fully Informed Jury Association feature.
[03:04:50.141 --> 03:04:51.141]  Well that's it for today's show.
[03:04:51.161 --> 03:04:52.422]  We're going to be back tomorrow.
