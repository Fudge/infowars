[00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:04.051]  I have had enough of censorship in this country and worldwide.
[00:00:04.511 --> 00:00:11.875]  We were all brought up being taught about authoritarian countries like Nazi Germany or Communist China or Russia where the press is censored.
[00:00:12.455 --> 00:00:21.860]  But I read hundreds of news articles a day and I'm here to tell you the United States is as censored or worse than many authoritarian regimes.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.361]  I send my reporters all over the country.
[00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:35.307]  I have been out myself hundreds of times, and in almost every case, whether it's a water treatment plant in California or the Austin-Birchstrom Airport,
[00:00:36.178 --> 00:00:38.961]  The police show up and say, you can't film without a permit.
[00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:40.902]  You can't film without permission.
[00:00:41.623 --> 00:00:43.845]  I've been in DC multiple times.
[00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.127]  They do not issue permits for news.
[00:00:46.608 --> 00:00:50.511]  And the police come and say, you can't film monuments like the Washington Monument.
[00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:55.536]  Give me a break from 500 yards away on a sidewalk, because you've got to get a permit.
[00:00:56.176 --> 00:00:58.559]  Then you say, well, wait, the city doesn't give permits.
[00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:02.474]  And they say it doesn't matter, we're going to arrest you.
[00:01:03.055 --> 00:01:06.697]  So it's the pure threat of force and the gun outside of law.
[00:01:07.577 --> 00:01:24.426]  It happened today again, when Jakari Jackson and others went down to the airport to ask the public about the fact that actual Al-Qaeda connected, listed terrorist, Muslim Brotherhood have been brought into the country and get to bypass TSA.
[00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:27.867]  The police came out and said, you gotta have a permit.
[00:01:27.947 --> 00:01:28.587]  Let me explain something.
[00:01:28.887 --> 00:01:35.128]  A permit is if you want to block off a major road in New York for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
[00:01:35.928 --> 00:01:41.049]  A permit is if you want to shoot a commercial or a Hollywood movie on the street.
[00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.490]  Cops have to be there, fees have to be paid, officers have to be paid for.
[00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:53.632]  If you as a news gathering organization under precedent, First Amendment, common law, you name it, want to interview people on the sidewalk
[00:01:54.392 --> 00:01:58.275]  Not interfering with the walkways, not interfering with the processing.
[00:01:58.335 --> 00:02:07.923]  If you want to interview people about what's happening at the airport, it's totally, completely protected, and it's been fought in court over and over again.
[00:02:08.323 --> 00:02:08.463]  It's 100%.
[00:02:08.603 --> 00:02:10.324]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:02:10.705 --> 00:02:11.966]  By executive fiat,
[00:02:12.586 --> 00:02:15.329]  And pure intimidation, they're violating the First Amendment.
[00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:17.871]  So, here is the latest in a long train of abuses.
[00:02:18.552 --> 00:02:25.758]  If we don't have the First Amendment right of the press to do interviews on city streets and sidewalks, we have no First Amendment.
[00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:31.484]  Here's Jakari Jackson's report, man on the street, and the police violating the First Amendment.
[00:02:32.524 --> 00:02:37.229]  But it's okay because they're just following orders and the cop tells him he's a big fan.
[00:02:38.814 --> 00:02:41.515]  We need to not just be angry at this police officer.
[00:02:41.535 --> 00:02:43.455]  We need to demand they follow the First Amendment.
[00:02:44.115 --> 00:02:58.158]  And if the cops in the future do the right thing and allow the First Amendment in clearly protected areas, then we need to back those police officers up with the corrupt cities and bureaucrats that are ordering them to do unconstitutional things.
[00:02:58.598 --> 00:03:00.858]  Because these police are doing this under orders.
[00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:02.619]  And it's easy to blame them.
[00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:14.702]  How about we blame ourselves for letting the system get this corrupt to think that in the land of the free, home of the brave, we have less press freedom than in Russia.
[00:03:15.182 --> 00:03:16.444]  Here's Jakari's report.
[00:03:18.607 --> 00:03:23.109]  Being placed on an airport watch list is something that happens all too often in our country.
[00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:31.253]  But what if you were placed on that watch list, not necessarily because of any religious or ethnic affiliation, but because you had affiliations with Al Qaeda?
[00:03:31.653 --> 00:03:33.354]  No, I'm not speaking about the CIA.
[00:03:33.674 --> 00:03:40.317]  The Muslim Brotherhood, which has been deemed a terrorist organization by the Egyptian government, has a free reign through our nation's airports.
[00:03:40.737 --> 00:03:43.319]  What do these God-fearing Americans think about this issue?
[00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:45.540]  Confident with airport security since 9-11?
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.281]  Absolutely.
[00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:53.045]  We've seen that the Muslim Brotherhood, a group that has links to Al-Qaeda, has been able to bypass security screenings.
[00:03:53.625 --> 00:03:57.147]  Do you think that's okay, that a known terrorist organization can bypass security screenings?
[00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.834]  I'll tell you, Miss, that the Muslim Brotherhood, an organization that has links to Al-Qaeda, has been able to bypass U.S.
[00:04:06.854 --> 00:04:09.756]  security, actually be waived through our security measures here in the States.
[00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:10.977]  Really?
[00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:11.898]  I didn't know that.
[00:04:12.758 --> 00:04:13.819]  What's your opinion on it?
[00:04:14.704 --> 00:04:27.449]  Well, my opinion is that when we have such stringent security, just like for people like you and myself, I flew recently, and I'm guessing that you went through the TSA checkpoint where you either had to get a body scan or a pat-down or, you know, something along those lines.
[00:04:27.709 --> 00:04:38.513]  So if you, a non-terrorist, have to go through all these stringent measures just to get on an airplane, I find it very unheartening, disheartening that a terrorist group can... It's annoying to go through security.
[00:04:38.833 --> 00:04:43.975]  The way they scrutinized me, I see that it is really... They say they scrutinized you?
[00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:59.422]  I mean in terms of like checking everything because I come with a passport which is African passport which I look like some brothers or Muslim people.
[00:04:59.442 --> 00:05:09.464]  And so if anybody who's listening out there you know any heads of state or any people in the Justice Department, Defense Department are watching this right now what would you like to say to them if you're concerned about your security?
[00:05:10.293 --> 00:05:17.522]  I would just wish that they would change the way that they do things and make everyone go through the same ritual that we all do.
[00:05:19.544 --> 00:05:22.228]  I know you guys are filming right now, so I'd appreciate it if you didn't.
[00:05:22.268 --> 00:05:24.871]  Well, I mean, well, sir, we film all of our encounters.
[00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:26.533]  If you want to talk to me, I'll be happy to talk to you.
[00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:27.474]  Well, OK.
[00:05:27.834 --> 00:05:29.396]  I'm just, well, how about you come over here?
[00:05:29.436 --> 00:05:29.837]  What's your name?
[00:05:31.341 --> 00:05:33.063]  Uh, if he doesn't want to identify him.
[00:05:33.163 --> 00:05:33.963]  I'm Zakaria Jackson.
[00:05:34.684 --> 00:05:35.285]  I'll talk to you.
[00:05:35.305 --> 00:05:35.905]  Okay, well that's fine.
[00:05:35.925 --> 00:05:36.386]  We can talk.
[00:05:36.786 --> 00:05:41.170]  I'm the airport operations person, and the thing is you guys are out here filming, and it's a business thing.
[00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:48.076]  Somebody gets hurt, you're not permitted, you haven't proven to us insurance and so forth, and so it becomes a liability for us once I see you guys out here.
[00:05:48.436 --> 00:05:51.059]  Okay, and so that's why I come over asking you guys, hey, what are you doing?
[00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:52.400]  You know, all that good stuff.
[00:05:52.741 --> 00:05:56.124]  Have you guys gone through the process like we've asked you to go through several times before?
[00:05:56.565 --> 00:05:59.528]  I've actually been here with you before asking you if you've done that.
[00:05:59.868 --> 00:06:01.810]  And so you're telling me you're not, you haven't done that.
[00:06:02.351 --> 00:06:03.632]  I'll tell you my situation, sir.
[00:06:03.692 --> 00:06:07.416]  You know, I got a, I got a producer and he says, you know, we want to, we want to shoot something.
[00:06:07.436 --> 00:06:08.037]  We want to shoot it quick.
[00:06:08.393 --> 00:06:09.494]  So just go out to the airport.
[00:06:09.534 --> 00:06:10.715]  So we come out to the airport.
[00:06:11.095 --> 00:06:13.277]  We're not in any secure area that I'm aware of.
[00:06:13.297 --> 00:06:14.819]  We're not shooting up by the TSA.
[00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:17.301]  We're out here, you know, we're talking to people as they want to talk to us.
[00:06:17.321 --> 00:06:18.963]  If they don't want to talk to us, we say, that's fine.
[00:06:19.263 --> 00:06:20.084]  We go about our business.
[00:06:20.584 --> 00:06:22.666]  So, you know, we're not interfering with anything.
[00:06:22.686 --> 00:06:25.448]  And I understand what you say with the gentleman Jason.
[00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:31.996]  And I sent the guy, I sent him an email soon as I found out that I was coming here, informing him of the situation.
[00:06:32.016 --> 00:06:37.802]  You know, I was sure that wouldn't be enough time to get a packet together, so you know, I at least try to do my due diligence and inform him.
[00:06:37.822 --> 00:06:43.208]  Alright, so just to be sure, the First Amendment doesn't apply to an airport?
[00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:44.610]  That's not what I said.
[00:06:45.444 --> 00:06:48.426]  But, you know, First Amendment's the right of the press, and I'm sure you know that.
[00:06:49.086 --> 00:06:51.287]  So, basically, I mean, where are we at?
[00:06:51.367 --> 00:06:54.629]  So you're asking us to leave, but we still have our First Amendment right.
[00:06:54.829 --> 00:06:55.310]  That's correct.
[00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:00.713]  We'll just call it quits here, and I'll ask you guys to leave unless you have further business with the city of Austin.
[00:07:01.793 --> 00:07:03.894]  Okay.
[00:07:03.934 --> 00:07:11.279]  So, just so I'm clear, sir, that because we didn't fill out, you know, a piece of paper to come out here, you're saying basically we can't film this location?
[00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:12.019]  That's correct.
[00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:12.920]  That's exactly what I'm telling you.
[00:07:14.428 --> 00:07:18.311]  Alright, we're outside the Austin airport having been asked to leave by the security here.
[00:07:18.632 --> 00:07:25.978]  It seems that the security force is more concerned about journalists with cameras than they are about the Muslim Brotherhood being waived through TSA checkpoint security.
[00:07:26.018 --> 00:07:36.467]  Now I want to be very clear with our viewers that when I speak about the Muslim Brotherhood, I'm talking about a specific militant Al-Qaeda-linked group that the Egyptian government has deemed to be a terrorist organization.
[00:07:36.547 --> 00:07:38.529]  I am not speaking about Muslims in general.
[00:07:38.869 --> 00:07:47.695]  So we came here today to educate the people and let them know that the pat-downs and the body scans and all the things that they have to go through are not required for known terrorist groups.
[00:07:48.056 --> 00:07:50.417]  We were encountered by a security agent for the airport.
[00:07:50.777 --> 00:07:53.159]  He told us that, hey, you guys need a permit to film here.
[00:07:53.539 --> 00:07:54.900]  And I tried to meet the guy halfway.
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.263]  I told him that we had contacted their PIO and at least informed them
[00:07:58.783 --> 00:07:59.404]  Of our presence.
[00:07:59.424 --> 00:08:01.566]  We didn't ask permission, but we at least told him that we were coming.
[00:08:01.907 --> 00:08:03.208]  He said, sir, that's not good enough.
[00:08:03.248 --> 00:08:03.889]  You need a permit.
[00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:07.573]  I said, well, sir, in the United States of America, don't we have a First Amendment?
[00:08:07.814 --> 00:08:12.219]  He says, yes, sir, you do have a First Amendment, but that needs to be accompanied by a permit.
[00:08:12.499 --> 00:08:15.683]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:08:27.353 --> 00:08:31.735]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:08:32.035 --> 00:08:34.316]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:08:34.616 --> 00:08:44.340]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:52.823]  That's why we're rolling out on 100% made-in-America line of incredible pro-liberty apparel.
[00:08:53.063 --> 00:08:55.585]  We are re-popularizing liberty.
[00:08:56.025 --> 00:09:00.267]  We are helping fellow Americans rediscover what made this country great.
[00:09:00.628 --> 00:09:01.528]  We are the spirit of 1776.
[00:09:03.029 --> 00:09:05.311]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[00:09:05.371 --> 00:09:10.594]  We are all brothers and sisters in arms in the animating contest of liberty.
[00:09:10.874 --> 00:09:11.655]  We're good to go.
