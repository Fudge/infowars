[00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:04.044]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:00:04.785 --> 00:00:07.989]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:16.158 --> 00:00:20.321]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:21.802]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.583 --> 00:00:23.463]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:27.746]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.327 --> 00:00:32.389]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.807 --> 00:00:45.251]  Well, this is going to be a particularly jam-packed worldwide broadcast.
[00:00:45.332 --> 00:00:53.201]  Our reporters are going to join us in 30 minutes live from New York City on the eve of the anniversary of the September 11th attacks.
[00:00:53.241 --> 00:00:56.586]  But first, here's a report filed by Leanne McAdoo that's shocking.
[00:00:58.382 --> 00:01:01.263]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:01:01.343 --> 00:01:11.187]  I am standing in Times Square, New York City, which is apparently the number one terror target, according to the online ISIS Jihadi magazine.
[00:01:11.527 --> 00:01:16.729]  Now, they've listed a number of target threats across the United States, as well as the globe.
[00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:19.930]  Don't forget, we've got 11 missing planes.
[00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:28.452]  They could do any number of things with that, but this is apparently the epicenter of what is going to be the new war on terror.
[00:01:28.572 --> 00:01:32.152]  Obama is set to announce that it's no longer Al Qaeda that we need to worry about.
[00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:36.533]  Now it is ISIS, the West's latest creation.
[00:01:36.873 --> 00:01:40.294]  They are going to use to front their global war on terror.
[00:01:40.674 --> 00:01:45.635]  Now we're going to be reporting live as well as you streaming here the next two days.
[00:01:46.215 --> 00:01:50.118]  Coming up on the 13th anniversary of the 9-11 terror attacks.
[00:01:50.458 --> 00:01:59.004]  Now, this year's ceremony is going to be a little bit different because the mayor's office and Mayor Bill de Blasio at City Hall, they're not going to be in charge of this ceremony.
[00:01:59.384 --> 00:02:00.084]  Guess who is?
[00:02:00.565 --> 00:02:12.012]  Now, former Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his top aides have been in control of this ceremony for the last 13 years ever since terrorists toppled the two towers all those years ago.
[00:02:12.413 --> 00:02:15.275]  Well, just before he left office, he made sure to
[00:02:16.095 --> 00:02:28.980]  Relinquish the control of this ceremony over to the 9-11 Memorial Museum and World Trade Center Foundation, of which he is the chairman.
[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.541]  Now, we all know about Bloomberg.
[00:02:30.621 --> 00:02:32.141]  He is the ultimate nanny.
[00:02:32.481 --> 00:02:36.663]  He wants to control the size of soda that people here in New York can drink.
[00:02:36.983 --> 00:02:41.686]  He wants to control how the people of New York City can exercise their Second Amendment.
[00:02:41.966 --> 00:02:49.971]  So of course, he wants to make sure that he can continue exercising control over the official narrative surrounding 9-11.
[00:02:50.391 --> 00:02:55.675]  Now one of the ways he's going to do that is by controlling who has access to the plaza.
[00:02:56.255 --> 00:02:58.418]  This year it's going to be closed off to the public.
[00:02:58.458 --> 00:03:06.729]  The only people who will be invited in are family members of the victims of 9-11 as well as politicians who've been invited in years past.
[00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.571]  That's it.
[00:03:08.151 --> 00:03:11.977]  Not on the invite list once again this year and it's a source of
[00:03:13.038 --> 00:03:15.779]  Protests, basically, are the first responders.
[00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:18.179]  The first responders are not invited.
[00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:31.923]  Shouldn't this be a ceremony to not only remember the fallen of 9-11, but also those who risked their lives as first responders who were able to save so many more lives because of them putting themselves on the line.
[00:03:32.323 --> 00:03:33.523]  These people are not invited.
[00:03:33.943 --> 00:03:41.806]  Is that because Bloomberg is concerned that they're going to cause a ruckus saying, well, what about all those explosions that we heard there on 9-11?
[00:03:41.826 --> 00:03:49.168]  It wasn't just the two planes hitting the towers, but all those anomalies surrounding the boom, boom, boom, as the firefighters described it.
[00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:59.395]  But also, could they be there to just draw attention to the fact that the healthcare that they had to fight for more than a decade to receive is about to run out?
[00:03:59.695 --> 00:04:00.055]  That's right.
[00:04:00.095 --> 00:04:02.877]  They were just granted this healthcare in 2010.
[00:04:03.317 --> 00:04:05.639]  It's about to run out 2014, 2015.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.763]  Obviously, these are very hotly contested issues here.
[00:04:12.223 --> 00:04:18.968]  Just so long, like, issues like the border, which as we have shown you many times, is wide open.
[00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.318]  Joe Big's dressed up as an ISIS jihadist.
[00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:27.731]  Bringing a head with him across the border.
[00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:29.152]  It's wide open.
[00:04:29.492 --> 00:04:32.414]  We are vulnerable to a terror attack.
[00:04:32.734 --> 00:04:35.336]  These are the things that they do not want you to see.
[00:04:35.616 --> 00:04:37.477]  These are the things that they want to control.
[00:04:37.557 --> 00:04:39.438]  This is the message they don't want to get out.
[00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:42.000]  They want you to see what they want you to see.
[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.123]  But that is not what we are going to bring you here at InfoWars.com.
[00:04:46.483 --> 00:04:50.045]  We are going to bring you what they don't want to show you behind the scenes.
[00:04:50.285 --> 00:04:54.368]  Hopefully we're going to be speaking with some of those first responders, getting their take.
[00:04:54.588 --> 00:04:58.714]  Seeing how they feel about being forced outside of the plaza.
[00:04:58.995 --> 00:05:00.497]  They risked their lives that day.
[00:05:00.517 --> 00:05:02.821]  Alright, that's a report from Times Square last night.
[00:05:02.841 --> 00:05:06.646]  The full report will go up on Infowars.com in the next hour or so.
[00:05:06.666 --> 00:05:08.048]  They'll be joining us live in 30 minutes.
[00:05:10.031 --> 00:05:17.100]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.362]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:05:19.563 --> 00:05:24.649]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:29.775]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:05:29.995 --> 00:05:33.056]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:05:33.316 --> 00:05:37.177]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:05:37.397 --> 00:05:41.638]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:05:41.718 --> 00:05:51.721]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:54.462]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:05:54.662 --> 00:06:02.707]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:06:02.847 --> 00:06:06.829]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:20.288]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:06:20.648 --> 00:06:26.752]  Super Male Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:06:27.113 --> 00:06:29.354]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:06:29.454 --> 00:06:32.517]  I look forward to waking up and taking my Super Male Vitality.
[00:06:32.537 --> 00:06:39.422]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Male Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:43.472]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:06:43.632 --> 00:06:47.595]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:06:47.896 --> 00:06:49.357]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:06:49.677 --> 00:06:57.264]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:06:57.544 --> 00:06:58.405]  But for how long?
[00:06:58.685 --> 00:07:04.950]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.153]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:07:09.662 --> 00:07:18.153]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being, and you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[00:07:18.353 --> 00:07:24.561]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:30.226]  Now, our extra-strength new nascent iodine formula is here, Survival Shield X2.
[00:07:30.486 --> 00:07:42.937]  Leading the way into the next generation of super high-quality nascent iodine, InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200-plus million-year-old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[00:07:43.337 --> 00:07:51.323]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients, and completely vegan.
[00:07:51.443 --> 00:07:54.906]  We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 Iodine for radiation.
[00:07:55.106 --> 00:08:04.453]  Pure, clean, and sourced from deep within the Earth, X2 Nascent Iodine is available exclusively at InfoWarsLite.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:08:22.457 --> 00:08:27.818]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:08:27.878 --> 00:08:36.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:50.183]  Different large sections of the Bill of Rights are being incinerated in front of us since the supposed terrorist attacks 13 years ago.
[00:08:50.243 --> 00:08:51.383]  Tomorrow.
[00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:58.553]  Our reporters are on the ground in New York City, Joe Biggs and Leanne McAdoo.
[00:08:58.914 --> 00:09:13.461]  They'll be joining us live from Near Ground Zero that is now a shrine to the end of the Bill of Rights and Constitution and a shrine to NSA surveillance against the American people and persecution of free speech.
[00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:15.062]  They will be there.
[00:09:16.041 --> 00:09:18.002]  Reporting today and tomorrow.
[00:09:18.803 --> 00:09:29.769]  Dr. Ed Group, one of your favorite guests, one of my favorites, will be in studio to talk about this whole vaccine controversy and how it's affecting the intestines, not just the brains of so many children.
[00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:42.677]  And more FDA, CDC whistleblowers going public, there's two of them right now in just the last month, saying no, they were basically involved in a cover-up of autism in the fake studies they put out.
[00:09:43.638 --> 00:09:45.520]  Saying that mercury was good for children's brains.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:46.580]  Close quote.
[00:09:47.361 --> 00:09:48.002]  I'm not joking.
[00:09:48.542 --> 00:09:49.223]  That's what they say.
[00:09:50.443 --> 00:10:09.258]  And then Colonel Schaefer, Lieutenant Colonel Schaefer, who ran Operation Stratus Ivy, the army special warfare operation to try to kill Osama Bin Laden, and it was ordered not to kill him two separate times, he can give us the real inside scoop on Benghazi and so much more, and on what's happening with ISIS.
[00:10:09.779 --> 00:10:10.740]  He was with us
[00:10:12.728 --> 00:10:14.109]  The week of Benghazi.
[00:10:18.072 --> 00:10:26.658]  And I almost don't even want to talk about him coming on the show, because then they call him and tell him not to, and he gets threatened, and a bunch of other stuff happens, but... You remember what he said here, and we've re-aired it.
[00:10:26.698 --> 00:10:31.302]  He said it was a hit to take out Ambassador Stevens of the heat-seeking missiles.
[00:10:31.862 --> 00:10:33.964]  The Empads could be transferred to Al-Qaeda.
[00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:35.525]  You now know them as ISIS.
[00:10:37.006 --> 00:10:39.528]  Now top generals have said that on Fox News and CNN.
[00:10:40.657 --> 00:10:41.838]  It's been in the Associated Press.
[00:10:42.478 --> 00:10:45.560]  We told you years ago, it's now confirmed.
[00:10:46.441 --> 00:10:47.702]  It was confirmed when we told you.
[00:10:49.363 --> 00:10:54.006]  I have a whole bunch of CIA sources, as you know.
[00:10:54.046 --> 00:10:55.367]  Some of them have been on air by name.
[00:10:55.767 --> 00:10:56.728]  Tosh Plumlee and others.
[00:10:57.508 --> 00:11:07.595]  I have Army sources, Navy sources, Marine Corps sources, Secret Service sources, FBI sources,
[00:11:09.574 --> 00:11:11.456]  And I don't get my info digitally.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.281]  That's how we understand what's going on.
[00:11:18.341 --> 00:11:22.545]  Plus, I have looked at the situations unfolding for so long.
[00:11:23.185 --> 00:11:25.127]  You can just see the propaganda they're putting out.
[00:11:25.407 --> 00:11:28.109]  You can see the different geopolitical puzzle pieces.
[00:11:28.429 --> 00:11:29.430]  You know the program.
[00:11:30.731 --> 00:11:34.474]  So much of what's going on is written about by David Rockefeller, Brzezinski,
[00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:38.071]  Henry Kissinger.
[00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:39.331]  I mean, I read their books.
[00:11:40.912 --> 00:11:45.774]  Wesley Clark went into a classified briefing after he'd already left the Pentagon.
[00:11:46.315 --> 00:11:49.276]  He'd been the head of NATO and other things, so they let him in.
[00:11:49.977 --> 00:11:51.257]  We played the clip.
[00:11:51.297 --> 00:12:00.042]  He gave two different speeches in 2007, where he was called into the Pentagon and they were saying, what do you think of this plan, General?
[00:12:00.382 --> 00:12:02.123]  There was a former general that was under him.
[00:12:04.926 --> 00:12:08.187]  And they said, we're going to destabilize and overthrow seven countries.
[00:12:08.947 --> 00:12:10.727]  And they went by list how they were going to do it.
[00:12:12.288 --> 00:12:17.829]  And of course, the plan was later to re-energize Al Qaeda to let them run wild.
[00:12:17.909 --> 00:12:21.810]  Not that they work for the West and follow every order.
[00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:23.591]  They just are very predictable.
[00:12:23.631 --> 00:12:30.052]  You give them a bunch of weapons, you open the door for them, you let them recruit in England and Europe, you let them fly back and forth.
[00:12:30.092 --> 00:12:31.112]  That's all in the news.
[00:12:31.312 --> 00:12:32.893]  They let them just fly around, do whatever they want.
[00:12:33.493 --> 00:12:40.118]  Now over here, the FBI will bust some of them and some of them are getting stopped because one hand doesn't know what the other hand's doing.
[00:12:40.418 --> 00:12:50.446]  And it's so compartmentalized, at the top, running these units, shepherding these units, protecting these units, turning these units loose.
[00:12:50.506 --> 00:12:53.328]  It's kind of like putting rattlesnakes in somebody's sleeping bag.
[00:12:53.528 --> 00:12:57.191]  You don't really run the rattlesnakes, you just dump them in the sleeping bag.
[00:12:57.211 --> 00:13:00.033]  It's like putting a box of Black Widows in somebody's bed.
[00:13:01.172 --> 00:13:07.379]  You don't really run the Black Widows, they don't take orders, but you got them, you took them in a box and dumped them in the bed.
[00:13:07.399 --> 00:13:09.402]  That's basically what's going on here.
[00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:12.926]  People go, wait a minute, you're saying our government runs Al-Qaeda?
[00:13:12.946 --> 00:13:12.986]  No.
[00:13:13.306 --> 00:13:21.176]  What I've always said is, they're protecting them, they're giving them weapons, they're opening doors for them, and then our military has to go fight them, and it's a real war.
[00:13:24.636 --> 00:13:30.959]  But the troops are dead and dying so they can have no-bid weapons contracts and destabilize the planet.
[00:13:31.999 --> 00:13:39.623]  I was on the elliptical this morning watching Fox News with the audio off, reading the teleprompter text up there.
[00:13:40.283 --> 00:13:44.605]  It's funny, whatever their teleprompter's telling them is back on the screen in the closed captioning.
[00:13:44.645 --> 00:13:48.127]  So it's like a two-way mirror as I'm reading the teleprompter that they're reading.
[00:13:49.748 --> 00:13:58.591]  And it was the text, and we're going to find the clip and play it later, of Bush in multiple press conferences saying, we've got to stay in Iraq in 2007.
[00:13:58.791 --> 00:14:04.614]  Because if we don't, Al-Qaeda will take over and use it as a base of operations.
[00:14:07.375 --> 00:14:10.376]  I know some in Washington would like us to start leaving Iraq now.
[00:14:12.417 --> 00:14:16.758]  Begin withdrawing before our commanders tell us we're ready would be dangerous.
[00:14:18.239 --> 00:14:18.699]  For Iraq,
[00:14:19.981 --> 00:14:22.624]  For the region and for the United States.
[00:14:22.644 --> 00:14:27.949]  It would mean surrendering the future of Iraq to Al-Qaeda.
[00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:30.671]  Hit pause.
[00:14:31.152 --> 00:14:33.474]  It would mean surrendering the future of Al-Qaeda.
[00:14:35.236 --> 00:14:35.876]  And that's true.
[00:14:37.337 --> 00:14:39.600]  Because you see, it's like coloring by numbers.
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.902]  They know Saudi Arabia hates Iraq.
[00:14:42.322 --> 00:14:42.963]  We attacked.
[00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:45.950]  Iraq for Saudi Arabia, basically.
[00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.131]  That was one of the largest reasons.
[00:14:47.571 --> 00:14:48.751]  They hated Saddam Hussein.
[00:14:49.411 --> 00:14:57.273]  Again, I'm not lionizing, but compared to the Saudis, Saddam, Assad, Qaddafi are a much better brand than Al-Qaeda.
[00:15:00.394 --> 00:15:09.336]  And so, if you don't keep control and have a Ba'athist, you know, group that's been kicked out, so you put Shiites, basically, in and a coalition government,
[00:15:10.566 --> 00:15:14.227]  If you don't do that, the Sunnis are going to come take over, which is actually a true statement.
[00:15:14.688 --> 00:15:16.768]  But here's the problem, George W. Bush.
[00:15:19.249 --> 00:15:35.115]  Going and removing Saddam began the destabilization to begin with, and you blamed him for 9-11 when everybody knows, bare minimum, Saudi Arabia was caught with their hand in the cookie jar up to their eyeballs with 15 of the 19 supposed hijackers and financing them.
[00:15:36.237 --> 00:15:38.479]  Now, there was a whole other operation going on on top of it.
[00:15:38.499 --> 00:15:39.760]  We know there were bombs in the buildings.
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.381]  We don't know what really happened.
[00:15:41.621 --> 00:15:44.243]  We just know the official story is a fraud.
[00:15:44.843 --> 00:15:48.686]  In so many criminal investigations, you don't know who did it.
[00:15:49.487 --> 00:15:58.354]  But if you pull up to a scene and there's a dead scientist and his wrists are slit, but there's no blood, you know they didn't die from slitting their wrists, like Dr. David Kelly.
[00:16:00.694 --> 00:16:04.415]  You got killed some other way, and it's now come out he was murdered by the government, basically.
[00:16:04.935 --> 00:16:07.556]  In England, for saying there were no WMDs in Iraq.
[00:16:07.956 --> 00:16:09.776]  So, see, it's the same deal.
[00:16:09.816 --> 00:16:11.677]  Do we know exactly who killed Dr. David Kelly?
[00:16:11.937 --> 00:16:13.337]  No, we didn't know for the first decade.
[00:16:14.438 --> 00:16:19.519]  We just know he'd been murdered, and they'd slit his wrist to make it look like he died from slitting his own wrist.
[00:16:19.899 --> 00:16:23.300]  But if you find me dead, and my wrists are slit, and there's no blood,
[00:16:25.592 --> 00:16:27.434]  That means I was taken there and I was already dead.
[00:16:27.754 --> 00:16:28.995]  It's the same thing on 9-11.
[00:16:29.535 --> 00:16:34.560]  You got cops going, they tell us they're blowing up building 7, get back, we have the video, we're going to play it tomorrow.
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.841]  It was on CNN.
[00:16:36.381 --> 00:16:39.004]  They announced the building had fallen, building 7, before it fell.
[00:16:40.145 --> 00:16:42.707]  BBC later admitted they were told it was going to be blown up.
[00:16:43.107 --> 00:16:53.016]  I heard and saw on television, but heard on CBS radio, back when they had CBS radio in 2001, they were going to blow up the Salomon Brothers building, known as building 7.
[00:16:57.472 --> 00:17:00.093]  So again, I don't know exactly what happened.
[00:17:00.714 --> 00:17:07.077]  I just have spoken to the police officers that are on that video on CNN saying, get back.
[00:17:07.638 --> 00:17:12.460]  And they said, well, the Red Cross came and warned us they were going to blow it up and that they had a countdown.
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:14.421]  And I heard the countdown.
[00:17:14.762 --> 00:17:19.464]  Two police officers told me who were on the video, heard the countdown to 10.
[00:17:20.024 --> 00:17:22.126]  So that's why they start running and saying, get back.
[00:17:22.626 --> 00:17:23.426]  They're going to bring it down.
[00:17:23.486 --> 00:17:25.828]  It's going to blow up because they heard the countdown.
[00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:29.171]  Now the media spun it that I was saying the cops had blown it up.
[00:17:29.431 --> 00:17:30.151]  I never said that!
[00:17:30.772 --> 00:17:33.032]  The cops got a 10-second warning to get back.
[00:17:34.533 --> 00:17:36.154]  And you see them running, get back, get back!
[00:17:36.374 --> 00:17:36.774]  Boom!
[00:17:36.834 --> 00:17:37.534]  It blows up!
[00:17:38.535 --> 00:17:39.735]  Do I know what happened?
[00:17:40.035 --> 00:17:40.435]  No!
[00:17:40.775 --> 00:17:41.796]  Are we being lied to?
[00:17:41.996 --> 00:17:42.496]  Yes!
[00:17:44.257 --> 00:17:46.778]  But they've got this clip of Bush that they're playing all over the news.
[00:17:46.798 --> 00:17:48.698]  Oh, this vindicates the whole war!
[00:17:48.938 --> 00:17:50.139]  Use some logic here!
[00:17:50.739 --> 00:17:52.660]  Going and kicking out Saddam Hussein,
[00:17:53.968 --> 00:17:57.689]  Who had been in the Stone Age since 1991 with his whole infrastructure bombed.
[00:17:58.429 --> 00:17:59.929]  Not a threat to anybody in the region.
[00:18:01.529 --> 00:18:08.190]  You take him out, it strengthens Iran, it strengthens Saudi Arabia, it strengthens all the other regimes to come in and take over.
[00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.251]  Oh, and then you gotta go back in again to clean them out.
[00:18:11.551 --> 00:18:14.291]  And it's an endless war, this endless money pit.
[00:18:15.192 --> 00:18:16.532]  What, five trillion dollars?
[00:18:17.092 --> 00:18:19.812]  Was the number I saw a few years ago that's been spent in Iraq since 2003?
[00:18:19.912 --> 00:18:20.632]  Five trillion dollars.
[00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:28.411]  For blaming them for 9-11.
[00:18:30.573 --> 00:18:32.535]  When the Saudi Arabians are clearly involved.
[00:18:32.815 --> 00:18:33.936]  Let's go back to the clip here.
[00:18:34.196 --> 00:18:37.098]  On the eve of Obama announcing bigger operations against ISIS.
[00:18:37.138 --> 00:18:38.139]  Don't believe that for a minute.
[00:18:38.399 --> 00:18:39.240]  That's coming up tonight.
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.260]  He runs them.
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.181]  He gave them the missiles.
[00:18:41.421 --> 00:18:42.422]  This is ridiculous.
[00:18:43.063 --> 00:18:45.805]  Let's go back to President Bush in July of 2007.
[00:18:46.025 --> 00:18:47.006]  Here it is.
[00:18:47.346 --> 00:18:49.848]  We'd be risking mass killings on a horrific scale.
[00:18:51.661 --> 00:18:57.326]  It would mean we allow the terrorists to establish a safe haven in Iraq to replace the one they lost in Afghanistan.
[00:18:57.346 --> 00:19:06.454]  It would mean increasing the probability that American troops would have to return at some later date to confront an enemy that is even more dangerous.
[00:19:07.996 --> 00:19:14.922]  Well, that's absolutely true, Bush, except our government in the last four years, under Obama,
[00:19:16.254 --> 00:19:31.841]  They gave the weapons, the protection in Syria, let them get a safe haven, then they ran back across and then Obama stood down when dozens and dozens of huge convoys of hundreds of trucks and armored vehicles drove in as if they didn't have drones and satellites tracking them.
[00:19:32.081 --> 00:19:37.183]  As if they couldn't have had jets come in and drop JDAMs on them all day and killed every stinking one of them.
[00:19:37.883 --> 00:19:45.587]  As if they couldn't have had anti-tank aircraft go in there and rake them with their Vulcan guns.
[00:19:49.423 --> 00:19:50.444]  No, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:55.327]  The globalists are destabilizing the whole world, and that's why I say the Al Qaeda threat is real.
[00:19:56.008 --> 00:19:57.108]  ISIS is real, folks.
[00:19:57.449 --> 00:20:00.711]  They may let them come here and attack us to take our liberties.
[00:20:01.411 --> 00:20:02.912]  So the war on terror is a fraud.
[00:20:02.953 --> 00:20:03.733]  I've always said that.
[00:20:04.013 --> 00:20:08.436]  But the terror threat is real, and I'll explain why on the other side.

[00:20:45.226 --> 00:20:46.987]  Spare fuel is the answer.
[00:20:47.227 --> 00:20:50.689]  Spare fuel can be used in any gas-powered vehicle or generator.

[00:21:09.332 --> 00:21:16.379]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:21:16.479 --> 00:21:18.621]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:21:18.821 --> 00:21:23.927]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:21:24.107 --> 00:21:29.132]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:21:29.272 --> 00:21:32.295]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:21:32.595 --> 00:21:36.437]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:21:36.657 --> 00:21:40.879]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:21:40.959 --> 00:21:50.984]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:21:51.204 --> 00:21:55.366]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.

[00:22:08.951 --> 00:22:13.973]  We travel so much, and having a fake TV, well, it gives Ed a peace of mind.
[00:22:14.113 --> 00:22:17.234]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets.
[00:22:17.615 --> 00:22:23.637]  But fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[00:22:23.757 --> 00:22:35.662]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[00:22:35.962 --> 00:22:40.326]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.

[00:24:03.329 --> 00:24:04.329]  The gambler understands.
[00:24:25.396 --> 00:24:27.617]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:24:27.637 --> 00:24:27.957]  to 2 p.m.
[00:24:27.977 --> 00:24:29.357]  Central, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:24:30.557 --> 00:24:35.899]  Alright, so Obama is set to announce reportedly tougher airstrikes on ISIS tonight.
[00:24:37.099 --> 00:24:38.999]  That's happening for a lot of different reasons.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:48.522]  Mainly because Congress, the public, Senator Paul and others last year, Senator Cruz, Infowars, led the charge on this.
[00:24:50.031 --> 00:25:01.522]  Pointed out that ISIS, Al Qaeda, that whole group of jihadis are being funded by Saudi Arabia, and NATO, and Turkey, and our government, and Israel's even aiding them in the north of Israel.
[00:25:01.882 --> 00:25:03.864]  That has all come out even in the Jerusalem Post.
[00:25:04.344 --> 00:25:15.735]  So the West has sickeningly, from France right through to Israel, from the United States right through to Germany, has backed Saudi Arabian and Qatari scum.
[00:25:16.775 --> 00:25:18.977]  I'm not calling Saudi Arabians and people from Qatar scum.
[00:25:19.237 --> 00:25:20.598]  I'm saying the Al-Qaeda is scum.
[00:25:24.382 --> 00:25:27.104]  And these groups are always trying to overthrow their own governments, too.
[00:25:27.184 --> 00:25:31.187]  So, see, they're exporting their troublemakers to all these jihadi operations.
[00:25:31.287 --> 00:25:37.533]  And Al-Qaeda, it's come out, is so Western-run, with Zawahiri and the rest of it, that they're not cool anymore.
[00:25:39.292 --> 00:26:06.563]  So that's why they're trying to claim this split where, you know, well, Al-Qaeda was in charge of ISIS, but now they're not, and now they don't like each other, and that's all to confuse the public that we, our government, gave a bunch of weapons in Syria, in Libya, a bunch of other places, to Al-Qaeda to make those countries be failed states, and then say, oh my gosh, we've got to invade Libya, we've got to have French airstrikes in Libya, because Al-Qaeda's there.
[00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:12.113]  Our governments collectively put them there.
[00:26:12.433 --> 00:26:13.814]  That's the big enchilada.
[00:26:14.074 --> 00:26:16.255]  That's the 20 trillion pound elephant in the room.
[00:26:17.456 --> 00:26:21.078]  That's the dead dog under the floorboards that's stinking the house up.
[00:26:21.398 --> 00:26:22.379]  This is the issue.
[00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:28.863]  And if the governments of the world can get away with this, they can pretty much say 2 plus 2 equals 100.
[00:26:31.479 --> 00:26:33.740]  Now why am I saying Islamic State's a real threat?
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:38.261]  It's just like a box of black widows dumped in your neighbor's bed.
[00:26:39.422 --> 00:26:45.684]  The black widows don't work for you per se, but you bred them, fed them, got them ready, and went and dumped them in the bed.
[00:26:47.495 --> 00:26:50.779]  Why are you dumping him in the bed to basically run your neighbor out of the house?
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.863]  And then you're offering an extermination service, basically.
[00:26:54.304 --> 00:26:56.306]  It's so that they have to come to you for protection.
[00:26:56.547 --> 00:27:00.111]  Hey, pay me protection or somebody's going to burn down your grocery store.
[00:27:00.672 --> 00:27:05.077]  Cicero 1910, New York City, Italian Mafia, La Cosa Nostra.
[00:27:05.638 --> 00:27:06.379]  It's the same deal.
[00:27:06.679 --> 00:27:09.021]  You better buy insurance from Homeland Security.
[00:27:09.361 --> 00:27:11.863]  You better give up your liberty and let the NSA run your life.
[00:27:12.204 --> 00:27:17.929]  You better have black uniformed police on the street corner and big black armored vehicles or the terrorists are going to get you.
[00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:22.753]  We better not let journalists videotape police or the terrorists are going to get you.
[00:27:24.054 --> 00:27:24.835]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:27:25.175 --> 00:27:27.257]  The police state isn't in the interest of the police.
[00:27:28.337 --> 00:27:32.919]  Of school teachers, of auto mechanics, of oil men.
[00:27:33.139 --> 00:27:34.079]  I don't care who you are.
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:39.141]  In the end, an authoritarian state is not good for the culture.
[00:27:40.282 --> 00:27:46.084]  But there are always psychopathic control freaks that gravitate towards positions of power in government and the corporate structure.
[00:27:46.104 --> 00:27:47.365]  There's a new study out on it today.
[00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:55.112]  And they're dominating those hierarchical systems, and they just have a twisted vision of the world.
[00:27:55.692 --> 00:28:03.255]  Now, I told you, we're seeing ISIS stuff pop up at the White House, at Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:28:03.836 --> 00:28:09.458]  We are getting chatter from Facebook and Twitter from real groups we've known about for years that are promoting ISIS.
[00:28:10.798 --> 00:28:16.401]  Government-connected, Cass Sunstein-type cognitive infiltration groups, COINTELPRO 2.0.
[00:28:18.749 --> 00:28:27.259]  I'm seeing real street cred with the trendies and with the liberals and people who just want to be shocking and into something dark.
[00:28:29.059 --> 00:28:30.060]  Promoting ISIS.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.322]  And I'm seeing demonstrations in Austin.
[00:28:33.822 --> 00:28:36.203]  I sat there with binoculars.
[00:28:36.504 --> 00:28:37.184]  I gotta be honest.
[00:28:37.204 --> 00:28:37.664]  Downtown.
[00:28:38.685 --> 00:28:39.585]  At a friend's house.
[00:28:40.026 --> 00:28:41.747]  And watched some of this go on just a few weeks ago.
[00:28:42.347 --> 00:28:43.368]  Almost called the police.
[00:28:43.868 --> 00:28:44.909]  With what I saw going on.
[00:28:44.929 --> 00:28:47.810]  But it was probably provocateur action, so I just stayed out of it.
[00:28:48.311 --> 00:28:49.611]  There's a lot of chatter.
[00:28:49.972 --> 00:28:51.192]  A lot of stuff going on.
[00:28:51.232 --> 00:28:54.394]  And we have sources inside that are saying all the other stuff was fake.
[00:28:54.654 --> 00:28:56.135]  We're being told get ready for something real.
[00:28:56.516 --> 00:28:58.457]  If we expose it, they may back off.
[00:28:59.417 --> 00:29:06.501]  But Voice of America has come out and said ISIS militants use jihad cool to recruit globally.
[00:29:06.881 --> 00:29:13.145]  Islamic State extremist group has a phenomenal virtual capacity through social media.
[00:29:14.386 --> 00:29:25.712]  And they either get dirt poor goat farmers from the Middle East that can't even hardly tie their shoelaces to go be jihadis, or they get rich trendies and other people from the West to go join them.
[00:29:25.752 --> 00:29:28.434]  And here's the big issue, what you're not being told by Voice of America.
[00:29:29.465 --> 00:29:36.207]  But you can see in mainstream news, the British and European governments are letting their jihadis fly back and forth.
[00:29:37.367 --> 00:29:46.050]  They're letting them operate, they're letting them recruit, they're letting them garner money to create the clash of civilizations so that when they do end up attacking,
[00:29:47.088 --> 00:29:48.329]  Guess who's going to lose their rights?
[00:29:48.669 --> 00:29:51.130]  Who do they tell you the last five years is the number one terror threat?
[00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:55.131]  Not Muslim extremists, gun owners, veterans, the Tea Party.
[00:29:55.471 --> 00:30:00.573]  It's going to be used against the very good old boys that are going to back the strike on ISIS.
[00:30:01.334 --> 00:30:09.297]  It's nothing but an attempt to disguise the fact that globalist intelligence agencies are running ISIS, aka Al Qaeda.
[00:30:10.618 --> 00:30:19.106]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being, and you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[00:30:19.287 --> 00:30:25.513]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[00:30:25.913 --> 00:30:29.575]  Now, our extra-strength new nascent iodine formula is here.
[00:30:29.796 --> 00:30:31.177]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:30:31.457 --> 00:30:43.925]  Leading the way into the next generation of super high-quality nascent iodine, InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200-plus-million-year-old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[00:30:44.305 --> 00:30:52.291]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients, and completely vegan.
[00:30:52.391 --> 00:30:55.813]  We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 iodine for radiation.
[00:30:56.053 --> 00:30:58.898]  Pure, clean, and sourced from deep within the earth.
[00:30:59.218 --> 00:31:05.408]  X2 Nascent Iodine is available exclusively at Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:31:10.615 --> 00:31:11.836]  Another major health threat.
[00:31:11.876 --> 00:31:16.778]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:31:16.858 --> 00:31:19.500]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:26.303]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:31:26.563 --> 00:31:29.425]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:31:29.565 --> 00:31:32.506]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:31:32.526 --> 00:31:34.507]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:31:34.527 --> 00:31:37.369]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:31:37.449 --> 00:31:42.950]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:46.671]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:31:46.691 --> 00:31:49.672]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:31:49.772 --> 00:31:56.873]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[00:32:09.637 --> 00:32:17.741]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.

[00:32:40.074 --> 00:32:44.456]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male, and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[00:32:44.736 --> 00:32:49.398]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[00:32:49.478 --> 00:32:50.499]  Talk about the effects.
[00:32:50.819 --> 00:32:52.320]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:53.961]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:32:54.241 --> 00:32:55.322]  I feel like I look better.
[00:32:55.362 --> 00:32:56.002]  I feel better.
[00:32:56.062 --> 00:32:57.123]  I feel sexier.
[00:32:57.143 --> 00:32:57.863]  I love it.
[00:32:58.103 --> 00:33:01.025]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[00:33:01.085 --> 00:33:03.827]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[00:33:04.027 --> 00:33:05.067]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:33:05.107 --> 00:33:06.148]  Consult your physician.
[00:33:06.288 --> 00:33:08.489]  Visit Infowarslife.com today.
[00:33:08.509 --> 00:33:09.610]  This is life changing.
[00:33:10.891 --> 00:33:12.752]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[00:33:13.872 --> 00:33:16.294]  Broke my leg in the Santa Fe.
[00:33:18.831 --> 00:33:24.855]  I lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[00:33:24.895 --> 00:33:27.837]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[00:33:27.857 --> 00:33:31.260]  I'll be looking for aid when they pull that gate.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.502]  And I hope that judge ain't blind.
[00:33:34.562 --> 00:33:38.705]  I'm a rebel by morning.
[00:33:42.651 --> 00:33:57.543]  Al Gore said that by the summer of 2013 that the Arctic ice cap would be completely melted and that the southern ice cap, the Antarctic, would be almost completely gone.
[00:33:57.604 --> 00:33:58.224]  He's on record.
[00:33:59.145 --> 00:34:06.451]  He also said that hurricanes would be twice as bad as they currently are, or at that time when he said it, a decade ago.
[00:34:06.591 --> 00:34:08.493]  And he also went on
[00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:13.602]  To basically say that the temperature would be three degrees hotter.
[00:34:14.223 --> 00:34:24.591]  Well, it is being reported today by Bloomberg.com, linked as the top story on DrudgeReport.com, that there have been no named storms.
[00:34:25.552 --> 00:34:37.177]  For the first time since 1992, and hurricane overall levels in the Atlantic and the Caribbean are at the lowest level ever recorded.
[00:34:37.758 --> 00:34:39.238]  That's a little separate factoid.
[00:34:40.219 --> 00:34:43.560]  Tornadoes are at the lowest level they've been since 1960.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.082]  You have to remember, they didn't have Doppler then.
[00:34:48.055 --> 00:34:48.996]  Blanketing the country.
[00:34:49.477 --> 00:34:53.602]  So it's probably the lowest it's ever been since any recordings have been made.
[00:34:53.922 --> 00:34:56.365]  Because now they have basically the whole country covered with Doppler.
[00:34:56.605 --> 00:34:59.729]  They know every time a tornado forms or sets down.
[00:35:00.169 --> 00:35:01.010]  The whole country's covered.
[00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:02.532]  Unless you're talking about areas of Alaska.
[00:35:02.873 --> 00:35:04.114]  The whole continental U.S.
[00:35:04.434 --> 00:35:07.939]  is covered by Doppler radar systems.
[00:35:10.325 --> 00:35:12.206]  And it is the lowest level since 1960.
[00:35:12.486 --> 00:35:13.967]  That's USA Today.
[00:35:14.748 --> 00:35:27.856]  Lowest tornadoes, lowest hurricanes, and the ice cap got 43% bigger in the north, and also 20-plus percent bigger in the south.
[00:35:28.256 --> 00:35:29.017]  I'm gonna say that again.
[00:35:29.037 --> 00:35:30.718]  I'm gonna say that again. 43%.
[00:35:35.643 --> 00:35:41.726]  Polar Bear numbers are five times what they were in the 1954 survey.
[00:35:42.487 --> 00:35:42.867]  Look it up!
[00:35:42.987 --> 00:35:47.429]  Just take anything I say, type it into a search engine, mainstream news.
[00:35:50.211 --> 00:35:51.912]  People say, well I thought mainstream news lies.
[00:35:53.173 --> 00:35:55.174]  No, most of the time mainstream news gets it right.
[00:35:55.434 --> 00:36:01.137]  It's when there's some big official story being pushed by government that you can bet your bottom dollar.
[00:36:03.919 --> 00:36:09.002]  You can bet your bottom dollar that it's a bunch of baloney.
[00:36:09.242 --> 00:36:15.145]  Remember this time last year, Secretary of State Kerry was on TV saying, we have got to strike.
[00:36:16.067 --> 00:36:20.729]  Syria right now, or they're going to attack Europe or the United States, it's imminent.
[00:36:20.749 --> 00:36:26.872]  Lindsey Graham said nukes could go off on the West Coast in New York or in the Carolinas or in Georgia.
[00:36:26.892 --> 00:36:27.272]  Remember?
[00:36:27.412 --> 00:36:29.032]  CBS News, we did reports on it.
[00:36:29.313 --> 00:36:41.918]  If we didn't attack Syria right now, when Assad had done nothing and was battling Al Qaeda, the main force, now known as ISIS, for three years at that time, it's now four years,
[00:36:45.902 --> 00:36:55.024]  Now they're saying NATO needs to go into Libya because ISIS, Al Qaeda, is running around slaughtering everybody and taking over the central government.
[00:36:59.765 --> 00:37:00.325]  It's incredible.
[00:37:01.926 --> 00:37:02.646]  It is unbelievable.
[00:37:03.786 --> 00:37:12.528]  And you've got Republicans and Democrats sitting there blaming each other, well Bush was right to go into Iraq and Obama was wrong to pull the troops out and that's why it's all falling apart now.
[00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:14.709]  That's not even the issue.
[00:37:16.741 --> 00:37:17.241]  In my view.
[00:37:18.422 --> 00:37:37.469]  Why did Obama and NATO allow Al-Qaeda in Iraq to operate in Western Iraq and in Eastern Syria until they now have engulfed the whole region and are attacking in Central Africa, North Africa, Western Africa, they're popping up in Asia, they're popping up in India attacking people.
[00:37:37.749 --> 00:37:44.912]  These are real jihadis, folks, that have been green-lighted to cause a global crisis and the reason I'm harping on it
[00:37:45.979 --> 00:37:52.045]  Is that if we don't get public awareness about this going, the globalists are going to open the doors for these people to attack.
[00:37:52.485 --> 00:38:01.573]  I'm pointing out that they turned them loose so that if any black widows bite us in our beds at night, we know who let the black widows loose.
[00:38:01.693 --> 00:38:02.374]  You understand that?
[00:38:03.495 --> 00:38:11.943]  Because our government and NATO, the people running our government, these criminals, are turning al-Qaeda loose all over the world.
[00:38:12.947 --> 00:38:23.695]  But then separately, Obama says we didn't build our business, and that raising the debt doesn't raise the debt, and Obamacare cut your rates even though it doubled them on average, on and on and on.
[00:38:25.296 --> 00:38:29.399]  Even NBC News admitted yesterday that it's doubling rates and wrecking all these small businesses.
[00:38:30.099 --> 00:38:30.900]  That was in the headline.
[00:38:33.402 --> 00:38:36.264]  Obamacare costs big bucks and destroys jobs.
[00:38:37.267 --> 00:38:38.568]  That's what it was written to do.
[00:38:38.828 --> 00:38:39.289]  And guess what?
[00:38:39.309 --> 00:38:40.029]  There's death panels.
[00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:41.851]  Well, now Obama has come out.
[00:38:41.871 --> 00:38:43.833]  Remember, I'm going to pull the troops out of Iraq.
[00:38:43.933 --> 00:38:45.214]  I'm going to pull the troops out of Iraq.
[00:38:45.454 --> 00:38:47.396]  I'm going to finish what we need to do in Afghanistan.
[00:38:47.996 --> 00:38:51.139]  Our troops will all be out of Iraq the first year I'm in office.
[00:38:53.081 --> 00:38:55.263]  Now he's saying he never said that.
[00:38:56.564 --> 00:38:59.847]  So regardless of what you think about the debate about should we have been in Iraq or not been in Iraq,
[00:39:00.791 --> 00:39:08.598]  Regardless, Obama ran on pulling the troops out of Iraq, and that's how dumb they think we are to get on the news now.
[00:39:09.218 --> 00:39:12.761]  It'd be like if George Herbert Walker Bush said, I never said, read my lips, no new taxes.
[00:39:13.041 --> 00:39:18.126]  No, he said, I'm sorry I'm breaking my pledge, but I have to do this, and he got voted out of office over it.
[00:39:21.569 --> 00:39:26.333]  Now, they just say, I never said that you could keep your doctor.
[00:39:27.261 --> 00:39:28.722]  Well yes you did, over a hundred times.
[00:39:29.162 --> 00:39:31.024]  I never said I wouldn't come after any of your guns.
[00:39:31.324 --> 00:39:32.745]  Yes you did, over a hundred times.
[00:39:33.005 --> 00:39:34.626]  You and that freak, Joe Biden.
[00:39:35.167 --> 00:39:38.389]  We're going to go to our reporters on the ground in Times Square tomorrow.
[00:39:38.409 --> 00:39:45.354]  They'll be near Ground Zero covering the fact that Bloomberg's Anti-Gun Foundation basically runs the New York event.
[00:39:46.515 --> 00:39:48.136]  There's so many angles they're going to be covering.
[00:39:49.241 --> 00:39:51.121]  And they also say New York's the big terror attack.
[00:39:51.361 --> 00:39:53.562]  If they're going to let ISIS into attack, I don't know.
[00:39:53.822 --> 00:39:56.582]  The government's saying imminent will happen on or before 9-11.
[00:39:56.962 --> 00:39:57.722]  I'm not saying that.
[00:39:57.862 --> 00:39:58.823]  I hope that's not the case.
[00:39:59.323 --> 00:40:04.884]  But I want to play a clip of Obama saying over the years that he wanted to get us out of Iraq and would.
[00:40:05.224 --> 00:40:07.604]  Now he's saying, I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:40:08.344 --> 00:40:08.724]  Here it is.
[00:40:09.224 --> 00:40:12.165]  For the first time in nine years.
[00:40:12.585 --> 00:40:13.025]  That's 2012.
[00:40:13.705 --> 00:40:15.266]  There are no Americans fighting in Iraq.
[00:40:15.506 --> 00:40:17.726]  Four years ago, I promised to end the war in Iraq.
[00:40:18.854 --> 00:40:19.194]  We did.
[00:40:19.715 --> 00:40:21.476]  Four years ago I promised to end the war in Iraq.
[00:40:21.836 --> 00:40:22.156]  I did.
[00:40:22.597 --> 00:40:25.358]  Four years ago I promised to end the war in Iraq, and I did.
[00:40:25.679 --> 00:40:27.640]  I told you we'd end the war in Iraq, we did.
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.102]  I said we'd end the Iraq war, we did.
[00:40:30.282 --> 00:40:33.024]  I told you I'd end the war in Iraq, and we did.
[00:40:33.044 --> 00:40:35.105]  I ended the war in Iraq as I promised.
[00:40:35.205 --> 00:40:37.647]  In 2008 I promised we'd end the war in Iraq.
[00:40:38.587 --> 00:40:39.108]  We've ended it.
[00:40:39.348 --> 00:40:42.512]  I was able to keep my promise and end the war in Iraq.
[00:40:42.532 --> 00:40:45.036]  In 2008, I promised we would end the war in Iraq and we've ended it.
[00:40:45.236 --> 00:40:46.658]  The war in Iraq is over.
[00:40:46.718 --> 00:40:47.879]  The war in Iraq is over.
[00:40:47.939 --> 00:40:48.941]  From ending the war in Iraq.
[00:40:48.961 --> 00:40:50.202]  That's why I ended the war in Iraq.
[00:40:50.222 --> 00:40:54.047]  For the first time in nine years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq.
[00:40:56.189 --> 00:41:00.733]  President, do you have any second thoughts about pulling all ground troops out of Iraq?
[00:41:00.793 --> 00:41:07.859]  You know what I just find interesting is the degree to which this issue keeps on coming up.
[00:41:07.939 --> 00:41:08.719]  This is two days ago.
[00:41:08.759 --> 00:41:11.402]  As if this was my decision.
[00:41:13.263 --> 00:41:15.285]  There you go, the Washington Free Beacon compiled that.
[00:41:17.487 --> 00:41:18.127]  Think about that.
[00:41:19.809 --> 00:41:22.451]  And then he basically goes on to say that he didn't pull them out.
[00:41:25.114 --> 00:41:29.016]  They are practicing lies out in the open to confuse everybody.
[00:41:29.316 --> 00:41:42.062]  I want to get a breakdown in the last 24 hours since our reporters have been on the ground at Ground Zero in New York City of the worst terrorist attack in world history by a non-state group, supposedly Al-Qaeda.
[00:41:42.102 --> 00:41:46.864]  Of course, we know that official story is not true, but it was used to take our liberties.
[00:41:46.884 --> 00:41:51.226]  But you're somebody that joined the military because your dad had been, I guess, a Marine
[00:41:52.026 --> 00:42:01.714]  And a family history, but you joined Joe, you told me, to go fight Al Qaeda because you were angry about 9-11 and you fought multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, were highly decorated.
[00:42:02.095 --> 00:42:06.919]  What is it like for you now to see all of this unfolding and to know our government
[00:42:07.299 --> 00:42:15.790]  Funded them, gave them a base again, and now our troops, undoubtedly folks, airstrikes are not going to take out this ISIS force, the most well-funded terror group ever.
[00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:21.216]  How did Al Qaeda go from being gone to being renamed and having billions of dollars and 200,000 troops?
[00:42:21.236 --> 00:42:21.437]  Joe Biggs.
[00:42:24.022 --> 00:42:27.085]  Joe Biggs here, Infowars.com, New York City's Times Square.
[00:42:27.105 --> 00:42:32.049]  It's like falling in love with the most beautiful woman in the world and then being betrayed by that woman.
[00:42:32.429 --> 00:42:38.495]  You know, I joined the military for a reason because I saw the actions that happened on 9-11.
[00:42:38.975 --> 00:42:47.783]  You know, I think like a lot of young men and women did, they were angered by that, without a lot of information, decided to go out and we went based off the propaganda we saw.
[00:42:48.383 --> 00:42:52.785]  We went straight to our recruiters and said, hey, I want to be a part of fixing this problem.
[00:42:52.846 --> 00:42:54.206]  I don't want to sit around and be lazy.
[00:42:54.887 --> 00:43:01.110]  And once I got there and I started seeing the lies unfold, it was the biggest betrayal of my life.
[00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:04.992]  Every time I come back here, it's a little bit easier for me today because I'm in Times Square.
[00:43:05.032 --> 00:43:06.413]  But I'll tell you, when I get closer to
[00:43:06.833 --> 00:43:07.554]  To ground zero.
[00:43:07.574 --> 00:43:09.495]  That's when I get choked up and I can hardly breathe.
[00:43:10.015 --> 00:43:15.239]  I really get weak in the knees, you know, because so many people lost their lives for a lie for no reason.
[00:43:15.479 --> 00:43:22.004]  And then the wars we started after that fact, the people who died on both sides for lies, for money, for these elite.
[00:43:22.304 --> 00:43:23.725]  It just makes me sick in my stomach.
[00:43:25.896 --> 00:43:31.158]  In your gut, and studying 9-11 13 years later, what do you think really happened on 9-11?
[00:43:31.218 --> 00:43:35.159]  I mean, we know the official story is a fairy tale.
[00:43:36.099 --> 00:43:40.581]  But we know Al-Qaeda and these other groups are real, but we know they're being openly funded.
[00:43:40.601 --> 00:43:43.302]  I just can't believe they're getting away with it.
[00:43:43.582 --> 00:43:47.743]  I mean, the bare minimum, our government is funding and letting these people attack us.
[00:43:49.181 --> 00:43:50.462]  Yeah, it's disgusting to see.
[00:43:51.082 --> 00:43:52.443]  I mean, you gotta think about this.
[00:43:52.543 --> 00:43:56.825]  How many coincidences could happen in one day and still people, they believe that?
[00:43:57.505 --> 00:44:03.108]  You know, how does a building right down the street from the towers fall at free-fall speed?
[00:44:03.449 --> 00:44:05.110]  You know, building 7, that's mind-blowing.
[00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:08.551]  If that doesn't make you think about the situation, I don't know what else does.
[00:44:09.192 --> 00:44:16.976]  A plane hitting the Pentagon without leaving any kind of wean marks, any kind of engine parts on the ground, just something that disintegrated into nothingness?
[00:44:17.899 --> 00:44:19.159]  I mean, it's a joke.
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:20.800]  It's a complete and total joke.
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:26.622]  All you have to do is go back, watch the videos, look at the news clips of them looking over the ground.
[00:44:26.862 --> 00:44:31.323]  Any plane crash you've ever seen in history, there's chunks of an engine, things like that.
[00:44:31.603 --> 00:44:36.645]  And every time that we've had one on, or the crashes that day, we're all just disintegrated nothingness.
[00:44:36.665 --> 00:44:39.786]  I mean, that's all you have to do is look at that.
[00:44:39.806 --> 00:44:42.106]  You don't need to be any kind of expert at anything to know.
[00:44:43.507 --> 00:44:46.868]  Just to look at the ground, go back and look at other plane crashes that have happened.
[00:44:47.429 --> 00:44:50.815]  Joe Biggs reporting from New York City and Times Square right now.
[00:44:51.316 --> 00:44:53.780]  I know you've got a bunch of stories you're working on, a lot of different angles.
[00:44:53.820 --> 00:45:00.812]  Tell folks some of the reports that are going to be coming up to Infowars.com and tomorrow when we have a live coverage of the memorial.
[00:45:01.741 --> 00:45:03.262]  Well yeah, we're going to do some man on the streets.
[00:45:03.342 --> 00:45:05.745]  I personally want to get out and speak to a lot of the people.
[00:45:05.865 --> 00:45:12.471]  Ask them if they think that the 13th anniversary of 9-11 will usher in a new decade of terror with this ISIS group.
[00:45:12.791 --> 00:45:20.238]  I want to find out if people are really disturbed as I am that there are 28 classified files still
[00:45:20.858 --> 00:45:22.439]  Missing from the 9-11 report.
[00:45:22.679 --> 00:45:28.703]  You know, Ron Paul is starting this offensive, basically, with social media.
[00:45:29.003 --> 00:45:35.087]  He wants people to put videos up saying, hey, we demand to have these 28 pages declassified.
[00:45:35.447 --> 00:45:36.188]  What are you hiding?
[00:45:36.488 --> 00:45:45.714]  You know, and based off some of the stuff, some of the people he's talked to, he knows that, well, he believes that, you know, President Bush had prior knowledge of the 9-11 attacks based off that.
[00:45:45.954 --> 00:45:48.756]  So I want to ask a lot of people how they feel about that as well.
[00:45:50.820 --> 00:46:08.876]  Also, if they think the ISIS terror threat is something that they're really worried about here in New York City, I'm very curious as to the, I don't know, the mood, I would say, of the people who lived here, went through the first 9-11, and if they think something like that is something that could actually happen again here.
[00:46:09.897 --> 00:46:12.479]  Joe, I want to expand on that point that you just brought up.
[00:46:12.899 --> 00:46:14.000]  We're not the ones
[00:46:14.966 --> 00:46:23.207]  That two Fridays ago put out the report saying that the government believes that an attack is imminent and will happen on or before 9-11.
[00:46:23.508 --> 00:46:25.768]  That was out of Homeland Security and the Border Patrol.
[00:46:26.148 --> 00:46:29.349]  We sent you down there to the border to cover it, to try to draw attention to it.
[00:46:30.889 --> 00:46:33.689]  And I hope there's no attack today or tomorrow.
[00:46:34.149 --> 00:46:42.471]  I'm trying to stop an attack because I don't want people to lose their lives, but even bigger, for all of us to collectively lose the engine of freedom, liberty.
[00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:43.810]  That's
[00:46:59.875 --> 00:47:03.458]  Well, of course, and you know, like we said, we fund them, we back them.
[00:47:03.478 --> 00:47:04.218]  They are now the, you know,
[00:47:30.138 --> 00:47:33.459]  Well, most well-funded terrorist organization in the world.
[00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:40.322]  You know, the fact that the CIA is giving them this money, I mean, quite honestly, do I think that a plane's gonna fly into something?
[00:47:40.882 --> 00:47:41.522]  Honestly, no.
[00:47:41.883 --> 00:47:45.504]  I think they're gonna use them, fly them in here, and then drop them off.
[00:47:45.784 --> 00:47:46.865]  I think that's a better chance.
[00:47:47.225 --> 00:47:50.986]  I mean, if we're funding them, we're not just gonna have them fly into our airspace.
[00:47:51.026 --> 00:47:57.829]  Why just go ahead and bring them in on an American airline, something like that, drop them off, let them eat up with some of their little sleeper cell things?
[00:47:57.909 --> 00:47:58.349]  It's a very
[00:48:00.077 --> 00:48:01.299]  Plausible thing that could happen.
[00:48:02.141 --> 00:48:06.889]  You know, I don't foresee another exact 9-11 happen, but I see something on the ground.
[00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:08.011]  I think that would be more...
[00:48:09.244 --> 00:48:11.726]  Of a different way that they would do it this time.
[00:48:11.766 --> 00:48:12.567]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:48:12.847 --> 00:48:22.334]  When a bunch of Al-Qaeda people or ISIS people go into school and kill 150 little kids, I'm not turning my guns in because the government opened the border up and gave them weapons and let them come here.
[00:48:22.655 --> 00:48:33.203]  And I'm going to be demanding, and everybody else should be, that the government people involved letting this happen, that they hang after a trial right next to the Al-Qaeda people.
[00:48:33.503 --> 00:48:34.324]  I've had enough.
[00:48:34.924 --> 00:48:42.289]  Of a bunch of crazy, jihadi scumbags being turned loose all over the world to destroy Libya, destroy Syria, attack Europe.
[00:48:42.449 --> 00:48:43.530]  What do you say, Joe Biggs?
[00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:45.511]  Oh, I'm completely sick of it.
[00:48:45.571 --> 00:48:46.332]  It's ridiculous.
[00:48:46.692 --> 00:48:48.673]  And like you said, all they want to do is use us.
[00:48:49.274 --> 00:48:51.495]  The elite, they love to have wars.
[00:48:51.795 --> 00:48:52.636]  They want wars.
[00:48:52.676 --> 00:48:53.776]  They make money off of it.
[00:48:54.257 --> 00:48:55.638]  This is their new tool.
[00:48:56.038 --> 00:48:58.720]  ISIS is their Frankenstein, like I said last week over at El Paso.
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:01.942]  That's the Obama administration's monster that they created.
[00:49:02.242 --> 00:49:03.523]  They want them to run around
[00:49:03.843 --> 00:49:09.325]  And put fear in the eyes of the American people, so they feel like, oh I need you more, I need you more Obama, I need you.
[00:49:09.586 --> 00:49:10.626]  Take my liberties away.
[00:49:10.946 --> 00:49:13.447]  I need police, I need MRAPs up and down the road.
[00:49:13.467 --> 00:49:13.787]  That's it.
[00:49:13.807 --> 00:49:16.248]  You guys can have all the guns, take my guns, I don't need them.
[00:49:16.268 --> 00:49:19.950]  Well Joe, I know you're going to be doing some live streams, we'll have them linked up on InfoWars.com.
[00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:24.912]  We're going to come back and talk to Lee Ann McAdoo for the next two segments, ahead of Dr. Grip joining us in the studio.
[00:49:25.272 --> 00:49:29.014]  But if you've got more to report, coming up in about an hour and a half,
[00:49:29.794 --> 00:49:31.076]  Before Schaefer joins us.
[00:49:31.697 --> 00:49:33.580]  Schaefer's on at 1.30 Central today.
[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:35.663]  Colonel Schaefer with a lot of key intel.
[00:49:36.264 --> 00:49:37.906]  We'll be talking to you at 1 o'clock today.
[00:49:37.926 --> 00:49:40.130]  If you've got more, if not, we'll watch for those reports.
[00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:42.173]  On the Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock.
[00:49:42.193 --> 00:49:42.814]  Thank you, Joe Biggs.
[00:49:43.595 --> 00:49:43.915]  Thank you.
[00:49:44.535 --> 00:49:52.258]  We're going to come back and get Leanne McAdoo's take on some of the stories she's working on for InfoWars Nightly News and the syndicated radio show.

[00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:40.990]  Our big story.
[00:51:41.271 --> 00:51:46.132]  Gun owners react as politicians continue to ban high-capacity magazines state by state.
[00:51:46.272 --> 00:51:49.214]  I think that these weapons ought to be stopped.
[00:51:49.394 --> 00:51:51.935]  Magazine restrictions have already happened in nine states.

[00:52:09.381 --> 00:52:09.781]  Question.
[00:52:10.142 --> 00:52:14.385]  Could too many GMO foods and toxins be overloading your digestive and immune systems?
[00:52:14.926 --> 00:52:15.766]  Answer, yes.

[00:52:59.609 --> 00:53:00.309]  Life's getting better.
[00:53:09.119 --> 00:53:09.860]  My name's Bruno.
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:11.080]  I'm 52 years old.
[00:53:11.341 --> 00:53:14.823]  I've tried different protein powders over the years and they've all tasted pretty bad.
[00:53:15.323 --> 00:53:17.325]  I tried One World Whey and found it to be delicious.
[00:53:17.685 --> 00:53:23.389]  After 10 weeks on One World Whey, my wife commented, you have more muscles and you're leaner than when you were 20 years old.
[00:53:23.849 --> 00:53:25.470]  My body has changed dramatically.
[00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:26.511]  I'm a cyclist.
[00:53:26.751 --> 00:53:29.273]  Normally I'll ride two days on and take two days off.
[00:53:29.633 --> 00:53:38.779]  After being on One World Whey, I rode 10 days in a row in over 100 degree heat and then I take another two servings of One World Whey and then work out at the gym for another hour
[00:53:39.699 --> 00:53:41.320]  I just couldn't believe these results.
[00:53:41.721 --> 00:53:45.263]  My normal muscle tightness and soreness after working out are virtually gone.
[00:53:45.663 --> 00:53:46.784]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:53:47.144 --> 00:53:48.765]  One World Whey comes in single serving.
[00:53:49.045 --> 00:53:49.985]  Just give it a try.
[00:53:50.626 --> 00:53:56.449]  One World Whey is derived from Amish grass pastured cows and is newly reformulated to be higher in protein.
[00:53:56.769 --> 00:53:57.190]  Call 888-988-3325.
[00:53:57.210 --> 00:53:57.430]  That's 888-988-3325.

[00:54:34.682 --> 00:54:38.905]  I was listening to this song this morning on the elliptical.
[00:54:39.365 --> 00:54:46.890]  I think that section that Merle Haggard sings is one of the most beautiful pieces of country music I've ever heard.
[00:54:47.991 --> 00:54:50.432]  Poncho needs your prayers, it's true.
[00:54:50.692 --> 00:54:53.134]  Save a few for Lefty 2.
[00:54:53.334 --> 00:54:58.557]  Of course, good old Willie Nelson.
[00:55:06.817 --> 00:55:13.061]  All right, Leon McAdoo joins us from the ground there in New York City in Times Square.
[00:55:13.161 --> 00:55:27.290]  Leon's got a bunch of special reports coming up on the nightly news tonight and live with us tomorrow covering the 13th anniversary of what has become a national holiday of fear-mongering and attacking basic liberty.
[00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:38.035]  And here we are 13 years later, total NSA spying, wide open borders, checkpoints internally, TSA groping everyone, and our government giving Stinger missiles to Al Qaeda.
[00:55:39.016 --> 00:55:43.778]  We now know the war on terror is confirmed, a total fraud, and an attack on our freedoms.
[00:55:44.118 --> 00:55:44.879]  Leanne McAdoo.
[00:55:45.885 --> 00:55:48.847]  That's right Alex, Leanne McAdoo for InfoWars.com.
[00:55:48.907 --> 00:55:51.528]  I'm standing here in Times Square in New York City.
[00:55:51.968 --> 00:55:59.812]  This is apparently the number one terror target according to the glossy online ISIS jihadi recruitment magazine.
[00:56:00.312 --> 00:56:07.696]  I was absolutely shocked, Alex, to find out that the mayor does not have security clearance to classified information.
[00:56:08.076 --> 00:56:13.159]  Just one day before the 13th anniversary of the 9-11 terror attacks, if this
[00:56:13.699 --> 00:56:22.887]  This city right here has a terror threat on it, heightened alert, and the mayor doesn't even have access to classified information that could protect this town.
[00:56:23.447 --> 00:56:30.292]  No, the mayor doesn't have access to 15,000 Stinger missiles, but Al-Qaeda does because our government gave it to them, but that's a non-issue.
[00:56:30.873 --> 00:56:31.593]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:56:32.274 --> 00:56:36.898]  He also doesn't have the ability to even control the ceremony tomorrow.
[00:56:37.859 --> 00:56:44.847]  Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg decided that he was going to go ahead and keep on having control over the official narrative of 9-11.
[00:56:45.267 --> 00:56:48.050]  That includes not inviting the first responders.
[00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:50.693]  They're going to be locked outside the gates.
[00:56:50.713 --> 00:56:52.294]  That's right, they're not even allowed in.
[00:56:52.995 --> 00:56:58.619]  Not just the families, the actual first responders, because they keep complaining that they were never given health care.
[00:56:58.899 --> 00:57:04.482]  No, it's all about a gun grabber and the Bloomberg Foundation running it and collecting money.
[00:57:04.982 --> 00:57:13.368]  We know United Way and others, Leanne, got caught on 9-11, along with the Red Cross, collecting billions and giving part of it to gun control groups.
[00:57:13.788 --> 00:57:14.909]  How much do you want to bet?
[00:57:15.169 --> 00:57:17.930]  I know you're investigating that and looking into it.
[00:57:20.913 --> 00:57:26.057]  Absolutely.
[00:57:26.097 --> 00:57:27.578]  I mean, of course, why wouldn't he?
[00:57:27.598 --> 00:57:32.101]  He can easily siphon off that money to further his own agenda.
[00:57:32.121 --> 00:57:37.886]  We all know that that's what he is very good at, pushing his agendas, his stupid soda ban.
[00:57:37.946 --> 00:57:39.027]  I mean, really.
[00:57:39.087 --> 00:57:40.628]  So, of course, he's going to siphon off
[00:57:41.008 --> 00:58:04.785]  Money to further his agenda and that's the thing that's really frightening if if this Memorial Museum 10 20 30 years down the line Continues to just push that official narrative kids growing up I mean you can barely get convinced then that 2 plus 2 doesn't equal 5 Now they're gonna just be going to this museum and continue to regurgitate this false narrative surrounding 9-11 we can thank Michael Bloomberg and the rest of the globalists for that
[00:58:05.526 --> 00:58:14.073]  Now I know that the city's also been trying to ban cartoon characters out there on the street, but I do see Mickey Mouse is behind you and also Elmo.
[00:58:14.974 --> 00:58:17.676]  Oh yeah, they're all around here.
[00:58:18.237 --> 00:58:30.007]  David Knight did a really great investigative report on this, but apparently a lot of these costume characters were really upset about the fact that illegal aliens were coming in and giving them competition for these jobs.
[00:58:30.507 --> 00:58:38.829]  So they're trying to band together and form these unions and get the city to force these illegal aliens to not come and, you know, give them competition.
[00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:42.730]  Turns out, a lot of these people themselves are undocumented.
[00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:46.611]  So it's kind of... So you've got the undocumented trying to stop the undocumented.
[00:58:46.851 --> 00:58:47.551]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:47.571 --> 00:58:48.311]  Stay with us, Leigh-Anne.
[00:58:48.331 --> 00:58:49.252]  Back to you in one minute.
[00:58:49.552 --> 00:58:50.752]  Second hour coming up.
[00:58:50.772 --> 00:58:56.573]  Leigh-Anne, we've got to come up with some angle for you to do something silly or big with Mickey Mouse or something.
[00:58:56.593 --> 00:58:59.214]  I mean, how do we know Mickey Mouse didn't al-Qaeda?
[00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:02.482]  This is Scottish John for InfoWars.com.
[00:59:02.582 --> 00:59:09.106]  I know that most of you here in this commercial already know about the New World Order, eugenics, and all the other issues covered here at InfoWars.
[00:59:09.286 --> 00:59:11.888]  The question is, do your friends and family know?
[00:59:12.068 --> 00:59:13.829]  If not, then I want to know why.
[00:59:14.009 --> 00:59:16.231]  Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with some people.
[00:59:16.311 --> 00:59:20.534]  They might call you names, or they just want to talk about sports, or soap operas.
[00:59:20.794 --> 00:59:21.795]  I say, so what?
[00:59:21.955 --> 00:59:23.936]  There's a battle going on out there right now.
[00:59:24.156 --> 00:59:27.258]  The ammunition is information, and the soldiers are you.
[00:59:27.519 --> 00:59:31.661]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[00:59:31.801 --> 00:59:37.465]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand years, and I'm still fighting.
[00:59:37.645 --> 00:59:40.667]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're gonna lose everything.
[00:59:40.867 --> 00:59:42.569]  The Info War is worldwide.
[00:59:42.689 --> 00:59:46.831]  Tell your friends about Info Wars and let them know that Info Wars doesn't print bull.
[00:59:47.012 --> 00:59:50.614]  It's real journalism and news backed up by documented facts.
[00:59:50.714 --> 00:59:57.777]  Step up and take your friends and family to InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and PlanetInfoWars.com.
[00:59:57.957 --> 00:59:59.417]  The truth will set them free!
[01:00:15.970 --> 01:00:20.132]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:20.812 --> 01:00:21.613]  You want answers?
[01:00:22.393 --> 01:00:23.274]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.934 --> 01:00:27.556]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:28.116 --> 01:00:32.178]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:47.128 --> 01:00:50.991]  We'll break down some of the InfoWars.com top stories coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:51.111 --> 01:00:52.712]  Dr. Grip will be in studio with us as well.
[01:00:53.213 --> 01:00:55.774]  Going back to Leanne McAdoo in Times Square.
[01:00:56.355 --> 01:01:00.678]  Leanne McAdoo, you know, we need to get those masks off those characters.
[01:01:00.998 --> 01:01:04.001]  There's face scanning cameras put up by Homeland Security everywhere.
[01:01:04.481 --> 01:01:05.942]  We can't have people covering their faces.
[01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:09.265]  I know New York's trying to pass a law because they might be terrorists.
[01:01:09.865 --> 01:01:13.568]  I mean, are you frightened right now because Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse are behind you?
[01:01:14.795 --> 01:01:15.715]  That's right, absolutely.
[01:01:15.755 --> 01:01:23.699]  You can't even wear a mask at a protest anymore, but these people are right here, terror watch Times Square, with their faces covered.
[01:01:24.059 --> 01:01:26.840]  These are potential ISIS terrorists right here behind me.
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:27.780]  This could be Al-Qaeda.
[01:01:28.801 --> 01:01:36.284]  I mean, I would go up and ask them that, you know, how do we know that they couldn't be a space alien, for that matter?
[01:01:36.304 --> 01:01:40.446]  I mean, none of us can have any privacy anywhere.
[01:01:41.206 --> 01:01:43.867]  And so, again, that's the big question, Leigh-Anne.
[01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:46.581]  That's absolutely right.
[01:01:46.661 --> 01:01:48.242]  Privacy is the big thing here.
[01:01:48.343 --> 01:01:50.084]  So we're going to definitely find out.
[01:01:50.144 --> 01:01:56.310]  We're going to find out if they are in fact American citizens, if they are not Al-Qaeda or space aliens.
[01:01:56.330 --> 01:01:58.672]  So we'll be digging into that.
[01:01:59.112 --> 01:01:59.613]  Absolutely.
[01:01:59.633 --> 01:02:02.876]  And obviously we can't joke because they'll spin it and say, are you Al-Qaeda?
[01:02:03.076 --> 01:02:05.658]  We should just say, should people be allowed to wear masks?
[01:02:05.938 --> 01:02:07.460]  Why anyone could be a terrorist?
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:11.924]  And then when they agree with you and say maybe so, go, well then why is government so secret?
[01:02:12.384 --> 01:02:15.527]  Why, since the National Security Act, can they do whatever they want secretly?
[01:02:15.867 --> 01:02:17.569]  That's why our world is so unstable.
[01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:19.551]  Absolutely.
[01:02:19.631 --> 01:02:20.452]  And you see him out here.
[01:02:20.472 --> 01:02:23.334]  The NYPD is all around recruiting.
[01:02:23.855 --> 01:02:27.558]  And this is one of those cities where you actually need them here.
[01:02:27.618 --> 01:02:29.280]  You need these cameras everywhere.
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:30.381]  And you feel it.
[01:02:30.481 --> 01:02:33.184]  And, Alex, I gotta say... You're being sarcastic, right?
[01:02:34.029 --> 01:02:36.191]  It's a little bit different here than I had imagined.
[01:02:37.312 --> 01:02:44.958]  It's very calm, and it's very quiet, and as I'm walking around the city, I feel like I am in the movie, They Live, with all the signs around me.
[01:02:45.038 --> 01:02:46.539]  I mean, it's surreal here.
[01:02:46.879 --> 01:02:52.744]  Well, we need to put a brain tap into your brain to read your thoughts real time as well, Leanne, because you might be thinking something bad.
[01:02:53.464 --> 01:02:54.125]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:02:54.425 --> 01:02:56.727]  I'm pretty sure there's drones following me around right now.
[01:02:57.611 --> 01:03:03.197]  Well, when I was there to cover the RNC in 2004, they did have the surveillance blimp out watching everyone.
[01:03:03.217 --> 01:03:08.263]  And it was, again, to break the ice and get people used to living under an occupied country.
[01:03:08.643 --> 01:03:10.065]  But we're no safer.
[01:03:10.345 --> 01:03:12.288]  What else are you going to be working on in the next two days?
[01:03:13.737 --> 01:03:37.165]  Well, one of the things that I thought was really interesting, when we make our way over to Ground Zero, we'll be working on just a few little reports on that, but one of the things I thought was really interesting, the things they're planning for the ceremonies tomorrow, at both the Ground Zero ceremony as well as the Shanksville ceremony, they're going to be having a moment of silence and reading out all of the names of the victims who lost their lives that day.
[01:03:37.625 --> 01:03:43.267]  Where they won't be reading out any names, they don't even make a mention of it, is there at the Pentagon ceremony.
[01:03:43.647 --> 01:03:43.787]  I think?
[01:03:54.671 --> 01:04:18.031]  Smoking guns surrounding the official story of 9-11, but for me It was really the plane that hit the Pentagon because I was watching that day I was watching and I was listening as a CNN anchor said or the reporter was saying I don't know where this person's getting their information But there's no plane anywhere near the Pentagon and I was looking I was seeing it with my own eyes that the Pentagon was still intact and there was no plane and I asked where's the plane and
[01:04:18.391 --> 01:04:22.913]  But they can just tell you now 13 years later of pushing this official story.
[01:04:22.973 --> 01:04:25.514]  I interviewed some of the people who were inside who barely lived.
[01:04:25.614 --> 01:04:28.095]  One lady who had her baby there with her at work that day.
[01:04:28.115 --> 01:04:30.556]  And there was no plane.
[01:04:30.576 --> 01:04:33.718]  And then people came to her hospital bed and said, you did see a plane.
[01:04:33.738 --> 01:04:34.538]  The FBI did.
[01:04:35.158 --> 01:04:36.739]  So it's just crazy.
[01:04:36.779 --> 01:04:39.620]  It's like Obama said he never pulled troops out of Iraq now.
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.801]  Of course, he said that hundreds of times.
[01:04:41.861 --> 01:04:43.222]  Well, that was his big success.
[01:04:44.019 --> 01:04:48.701]  Two plus two equals five, Leanne, and if you don't believe it, you know what you are, right?
[01:04:50.022 --> 01:04:54.384]  I'm just so frightened of a future filled with Common Core students.
[01:04:55.285 --> 01:05:01.948]  I think we need to have a camera literally inside our head just to make sure that Al-Qaeda isn't inside of there doing something bad.
[01:05:02.329 --> 01:05:06.251]  All right, Leanne, we'll check in with you at one o'clock today before Colonel Schaefer joins us.
[01:05:06.291 --> 01:05:06.891]  Great job.
[01:05:07.251 --> 01:05:07.952]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:07.972 --> 01:05:08.432]  Stay with us.
[01:05:10.663 --> 01:05:17.546]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.
[01:05:17.946 --> 01:05:25.269]  Whether you're out for dinner, working on the farm, or on the road, Diamond Gusset Jeans offers a full spectrum of style and sizes for any occasion.
[01:05:25.849 --> 01:05:30.391]  Our loyal customers enable us to continue sponsoring Liberty Media outlets.

[01:05:36.754 --> 01:05:39.675]  In Liberty, David Hall, Diamond Gusset Jeans Company.
[01:05:40.151 --> 01:05:43.653]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:05:43.813 --> 01:05:47.775]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:48.095 --> 01:05:49.536]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:05:49.856 --> 01:05:57.460]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.561]  But for how long?
[01:05:58.861 --> 01:06:05.124]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:06:05.504 --> 01:06:08.326]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:06:10.003 --> 01:06:16.126]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential Fort Hood situation?
[01:06:16.146 --> 01:06:19.468]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:06:19.568 --> 01:06:21.149]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[01:06:21.169 --> 01:06:27.492]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:06:27.592 --> 01:06:33.495]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[01:06:33.635 --> 01:06:37.398]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:06:37.579 --> 01:06:40.481]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:06:40.661 --> 01:06:48.669]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:06:48.949 --> 01:06:50.991]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:06:51.051 --> 01:06:52.072]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:06:52.452 --> 01:07:01.196]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:21.509]  Sight is the primary input to the brain, arguably making eyesight the most important sense we have.
[01:07:21.849 --> 01:07:29.794]  And just like the other important organs in our bodies, our eyes function at peak levels when they are fed the proper amounts of essential nutrition.
[01:07:30.194 --> 01:07:31.295]  Open your eyes!

[01:08:00.936 --> 01:08:01.356]  Occupower.
[01:08:01.376 --> 01:08:02.137]  Open your eyes.
[01:08:12.290 --> 01:08:14.511]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:15.071 --> 01:08:17.952]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.972 --> 01:08:41.939]  What's happening right now is the establishment's attempt to basically overthrow reality, or have a war on reality.
[01:08:43.092 --> 01:09:00.749]  Where the West, as a group, can arm Al-Qaeda, change their name to ISIS, let them overthrow Libya, try to overthrow Syria, invade Iraq, give them Stinger missiles, and then take everybody's freedoms back in Europe, back in the UK, Australia, the United States.
[01:09:02.351 --> 01:09:04.313]  And other countries have used the war on terror.
[01:09:04.913 --> 01:09:07.336]  Russia has used the war on terror to take freedoms away.
[01:09:08.374 --> 01:09:13.379]  So, the Middle Eastern Jihadis are government's best friend.
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:20.245]  And that's why I'm so upset that Obama openly armed them the last four years.
[01:09:20.765 --> 01:09:28.553]  And now, the headline in the Washington Post, Obama ready to strike at Islamic State militants in Syria, he tells policy experts.
[01:09:29.229 --> 01:09:30.550]  We also played a clip last hour.
[01:09:30.570 --> 01:09:32.611]  We're at a White House press conference two days ago.
[01:09:33.312 --> 01:09:43.038]  He said that he never really pulled the troops out of Iraq, even though that's always what he said he was going to do when he got elected.
[01:09:43.058 --> 01:09:53.024]  One of the few things he actually somewhat followed his promise on, whether you were for the war or against the war, I was against it by the way, it's the saying he never said that.
[01:09:54.005 --> 01:09:55.446]  I never said you could keep your doctor.
[01:09:55.766 --> 01:09:57.507]  I never said it wouldn't increase your health care.
[01:09:58.847 --> 01:09:59.427]  I never said.
[01:09:59.447 --> 01:10:00.088]  I never said.
[01:10:00.108 --> 01:10:04.349]  So that's just some of the news on that front.
[01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:16.455]  Also, up on Infowars.com, anti-gun group takes control of 9-11 ceremony Bloomberg controls and his foundation controls New York's 9-11 anniversary for the 13th year.
[01:10:17.295 --> 01:10:21.397]  White House denies murdering journalist
[01:10:22.435 --> 01:10:26.258]  Who was sold to ISIS by US-supported Syrian rebels.
[01:10:27.258 --> 01:10:30.861]  Obama, again, is set to ignore Congress and announce serious strikes tonight.
[01:10:31.141 --> 01:10:41.848]  They want to strike ISIS, but they want him to come to them, basically, or even have a policy, and he doesn't want to set the precedent that Congress is involved in war, even though they're supposed to be.
[01:10:42.349 --> 01:10:43.109]  It's total treason.
[01:10:43.529 --> 01:10:51.455]  CFR has come out and floated free money to the American people so they can blame hyperinflation on the population right as it begins to go up.
[01:10:52.984 --> 01:10:55.927]  James Woods, the actor, has come out with a mission.
[01:10:56.207 --> 01:11:00.592]  He's issued the Pound or Hashtag Holder Challenge.
[01:11:00.772 --> 01:11:02.174]  Ask followers for help.
[01:11:02.874 --> 01:11:03.916]  We've retweeted this.
[01:11:04.436 --> 01:11:08.320]  He's asking the race-baiting Attorney General.
[01:11:09.318 --> 01:11:15.582]  To decry all the racial attacks on whites that have been going on, and to call it racist so that people stop doing it.
[01:11:16.122 --> 01:11:26.768]  But it's supposedly kosher and okay to attack whites, and we see it, these attacks at shopping malls, Kroger's food stores, at the park, just intensifying.
[01:11:27.289 --> 01:11:32.652]  On video, the people saying it's racially motivated, and nobody gets arrested, nobody gets charged with a hate crime.
[01:11:33.352 --> 01:11:35.975]  Really, pretty frightening that that's going on.
[01:11:35.995 --> 01:11:40.579]  I mean, would you endorse the Klan if they were out beating up black people again?
[01:11:40.599 --> 01:11:43.422]  Or say it was okay, or not decry it?
[01:11:44.783 --> 01:11:47.826]  So, that's some of the news up on InfoWars.com.
[01:11:47.846 --> 01:11:51.750]  There's an article out today, I basically said this yesterday and I agree with it, the era
[01:11:52.791 --> 01:12:02.539]  of widespread biometric identification and microchip implants is here with the rollout of the new iPhone 6 and the iWatch.
[01:12:03.308 --> 01:12:04.088]  The Apple Watch.
[01:12:04.929 --> 01:12:08.010]  It tracks everything you're doing, it surveils you, it's all out in the open.
[01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:16.054]  A chilling video I'm going to cover in the next hour and break down for radio listeners is on the front page of PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:12:16.774 --> 01:12:20.216]  Video model shows how Ebola will spread.
[01:12:20.296 --> 01:12:26.198]  It only takes one infected individual making it through an airport checkpoint, close quote.
[01:12:27.979 --> 01:12:30.400]  So that is coming up as well.
[01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:31.721]  And on the
[01:12:33.183 --> 01:12:34.345]  Ebola front.
[01:12:35.627 --> 01:12:38.332]  Here are some of the headlines.
[01:12:38.833 --> 01:12:43.881]  Ebola seriously threatens Liberia's national existence, their minister says.
[01:12:44.844 --> 01:12:47.465]  Their national existence is threatened.
[01:12:48.246 --> 01:12:57.671]  Continuing here, that's an article out of Reuters, World Health Organization, Ebola has killed 2,288, nearly half in the past 21 days.
[01:12:58.091 --> 01:13:03.514]  It is spreading very, very quickly and a lot of these countries in Africa are saying it's much worse than the media is saying here.
[01:13:03.774 --> 01:13:07.436]  A fourth person with Ebola has been transferred to Atlanta, Georgia.
[01:13:07.856 --> 01:13:08.617]  Very reckless.
[01:13:08.857 --> 01:13:10.638]  We'll get Dr. Gripp's take on that in a moment.
[01:13:11.218 --> 01:13:15.884]  Continuing, Ebola virus spread by taxi passengers says World Health Organization.
[01:13:16.505 --> 01:13:19.688]  So that's some of the news on that front.
[01:13:19.708 --> 01:13:28.159]  And you can go to Infowars.com and see the video showing the model of how it would spread.
[01:13:29.944 --> 01:13:35.668]  I'm asking the question, will they allow Ebola to get to this country or even bring it here as a pretext for political diversion?
[01:13:36.288 --> 01:13:40.672]  The anthrax of 2001 turned out to be Fort Detrick, Maryland, U.S.
[01:13:40.732 --> 01:13:41.692]  super-weaponized.
[01:13:42.173 --> 01:13:44.174]  So the FBI tried to set up three Patsy's.
[01:13:44.214 --> 01:13:44.794]  That failed.
[01:13:45.175 --> 01:13:48.057]  The fourth Patsy was killed in custody.
[01:13:48.557 --> 01:13:50.999]  So that's some of the news on that front.
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:57.324]  Another headline, Feds forcing public schools to accept illegal children without medical screening.
[01:13:57.384 --> 01:14:02.668]  Speaking of Ebola, Obama administration ignores law to ensure future voting base.
[01:14:02.708 --> 01:14:03.448]  The Daily Caller.
[01:14:04.169 --> 01:14:04.849]  Think about that.
[01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:12.695]  We have such a medical tyranny in this country and they try to force vaccines that give kids a lot of the illnesses and diseases that's been proven.
[01:14:13.676 --> 01:14:16.458]  But then they'll let illegals in with tuberculosis.
[01:14:17.018 --> 01:14:19.140]  You name it, it is just crazy.
[01:14:20.652 --> 01:14:25.513]  Speaking of craziness, China meat scandal deals another blow to McDonald's in Japan.
[01:14:26.634 --> 01:14:37.056]  From Russia to Spain to Japan, the citizens just won't eat the nuggets now because they read and know that it's 16-day-old dead meat from the company they use.
[01:14:37.317 --> 01:14:38.737]  That's why they want it radiated.
[01:14:39.017 --> 01:14:41.318]  They spray the viruses on it that eat the bacteria.
[01:14:41.818 --> 01:14:43.218]  It's not food, folks.
[01:14:44.058 --> 01:14:45.859]  I ate McDonald's like five years ago on the road.
[01:14:45.879 --> 01:14:46.299]  There's nothing else.
[01:14:46.339 --> 01:14:46.839]  I got sick.
[01:14:47.519 --> 01:14:48.460]  But if you eat it every day, you're...
[01:14:50.228 --> 01:14:50.929]  You're used to it.
[01:14:52.151 --> 01:14:52.992]  Full of additives.
[01:14:53.092 --> 01:14:54.855]  Full of plasticizers.
[01:14:55.556 --> 01:14:57.198]  They're all grandfathered in to do this.
[01:14:57.238 --> 01:14:57.899]  It's crazy.
[01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:02.445]  But in places like Japan, people just won't buy it.
[01:15:02.485 --> 01:15:03.567]  The government's not banned it.
[01:15:04.568 --> 01:15:05.610]  Russia and others are banning it.
[01:15:07.781 --> 01:15:09.302]  If it's imported from there.
[01:15:10.223 --> 01:15:13.085]  It just shows how America is a dumping ground for anything.
[01:15:13.346 --> 01:15:14.607]  Bad Chinese drugs.
[01:15:15.127 --> 01:15:16.508]  Melamine in the milk.
[01:15:16.568 --> 01:15:18.490]  They executed the people that did that in China.
[01:15:19.170 --> 01:15:22.013]  Our FDA came out a few years ago and said, oh, melamine's okay for kids.
[01:15:23.414 --> 01:15:24.234]  It's wild.
[01:15:24.414 --> 01:15:26.376]  And again, I'm not just here being negative.
[01:15:26.736 --> 01:15:33.602]  When we talk about these type of things, and Americans start caring again, and you stop buying
[01:15:34.983 --> 01:15:40.187]  From places that feed you absolute garbage, they will clean their act up and stop doing it.
[01:15:40.387 --> 01:15:45.651]  When you demand quality, across the board, it raises the culture.
[01:15:46.051 --> 01:15:51.135]  Somehow we got sold the idea that when you pick up your own food and throw it away, that lowers the price.
[01:15:51.215 --> 01:15:51.416]  No.
[01:15:51.896 --> 01:15:59.882]  They just get rid of Help, so the McDonald's are all filthy, and then all the other restaurants do it, and suddenly we just adopt dirty bathrooms and food all over the floor.
[01:16:00.242 --> 01:16:00.883]  And GMO.
[01:16:03.407 --> 01:16:12.450]  When government gets in control of health care and says, Bill Gates says, when we kill one old lady with a death panel, we can hire ten teachers.
[01:16:13.050 --> 01:16:14.231]  And the teachers all clap.
[01:16:15.351 --> 01:16:17.672]  No, when you lower quality and get rid of old people,
[01:16:19.257 --> 01:16:21.278]  As if you teachers aren't going to get screwed over.
[01:16:21.618 --> 01:16:29.661]  It's the idea that somebody gets cheated, we lower our quality of life, we lower our standards, we have austerity, and that it makes everything better.
[01:16:29.841 --> 01:16:30.421]  No it doesn't!
[01:16:30.661 --> 01:16:39.864]  The globalists just want you to accept that so they can socially engineer you because poor people that aren't upwardly mobile aren't uppity and can be pushed around.
[01:16:41.285 --> 01:16:42.365]  And the elite, meanwhile,
[01:16:43.527 --> 01:16:50.130]  The inflation with elite items is just off the chart, because they're up there literally running a rigged global casino.
[01:16:50.430 --> 01:16:53.612]  The Gulag Archipelago, or what does Max Keiser call it?
[01:16:53.632 --> 01:16:54.752]  The Casino Gulag Model.
[01:16:55.272 --> 01:17:03.036]  He drove up here from South Texas, Dr. Group, one of the top product developers in the country, and a good friend of mine.
[01:17:03.056 --> 01:17:06.638]  Global Healing Center is his organization.
[01:17:07.611 --> 01:17:07.771]  Yes.
[01:17:26.411 --> 01:17:33.297]  He helped us develop Occupower, and again, these are high quality products, but we fund our operation with quality.
[01:17:33.777 --> 01:17:40.743]  So it's a win for us, it's a win for you to get a high quality product, a win for us, a win for you, that you then promote a platform of aggressive liberty.
[01:17:42.044 --> 01:17:51.533]  This is what it's all about, so Dr. Group has helped us on so many fronts at InfoWarsLife.com, and now on InfoWarsLife.com, we are selling OxyPowder.
[01:17:52.475 --> 01:18:00.647]  And what happened is, as anybody can see, I've lost even more weight and I'm just glowing compared to what I looked like a couple years ago with the products he helped us develop.
[01:18:01.007 --> 01:18:01.948]  And it just gets better and better.
[01:18:01.968 --> 01:18:07.456]  Well, they finally convinced me to, a couple nights a week, do a detox and start taking Oxy Powder.
[01:18:08.491 --> 01:18:09.872]  That he's the world leader in this.
[01:18:09.892 --> 01:18:12.433]  There's a few knockoffs out there, but he's the progenitor of it.
[01:18:12.473 --> 01:18:14.454]  It's his main global line.
[01:18:15.074 --> 01:18:17.155]  Oxygen-based intestinal cleanser.
[01:18:17.916 --> 01:18:20.377]  And it is literally oxygen tablets.
[01:18:20.577 --> 01:18:23.038]  He's going to break down how it works, that go into the intestines.
[01:18:23.538 --> 01:18:24.499]  You take these at night.
[01:18:24.539 --> 01:18:26.140]  It goes through the stomach, into the intestines.
[01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:29.941]  And boy, let me tell you, you want something that cleans you out.
[01:18:30.362 --> 01:18:34.003]  You want to... Me personally, I just started this two weeks ago.
[01:18:34.964 --> 01:18:36.244]  I lost 10 pounds.
[01:18:38.530 --> 01:18:41.051]  My belly went down because it wasn't fat, folks.
[01:18:41.091 --> 01:18:41.891]  It was my gut.
[01:18:42.371 --> 01:18:45.752]  I'm not going to get into details here, but life-changing.
[01:18:46.472 --> 01:18:49.153]  And I'm going to go from taking it two or three nights a week to seven nights a week.
[01:18:49.173 --> 01:18:52.114]  You've got to build up to it to flush my guts out.
[01:18:53.134 --> 01:18:54.995]  If you think of John Wayne would have only had this.
[01:18:55.715 --> 01:18:56.935]  Oxy Powder.
[01:18:57.455 --> 01:18:59.616]  Oxygen-based intestinal cleanser dietary supplement.
[01:19:00.116 --> 01:19:00.756]  He's not here.
[01:19:00.796 --> 01:19:02.217]  He didn't even come up here to plug this today.
[01:19:02.457 --> 01:19:03.997]  But I said, no, we're going to talk about it.
[01:19:04.237 --> 01:19:05.858]  Plus it funds InfoWars.com.
[01:19:07.085 --> 01:19:08.466]  It funds our whole operation.
[01:19:09.067 --> 01:19:13.050]  What we're doing here, this is the out-of-the-park product.
[01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:16.633]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:19:17.093 --> 01:19:19.135]  120 vegetarian-based capsules.
[01:19:19.415 --> 01:19:21.096]  I'm done ranting about that, Dr. Grip.
[01:19:21.316 --> 01:19:22.317]  I want to get into Ebola.
[01:19:22.637 --> 01:19:25.099]  I want to get into how toxins enter the body, how to truly detox.
[01:19:25.119 --> 01:19:25.740]  This is part of it.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.681]  But let's just plug out of the gates here.
[01:19:28.342 --> 01:19:29.483]  And, you know, infomercial now.
[01:19:31.367 --> 01:19:32.268]  How did you develop it?
[01:19:32.429 --> 01:19:33.590]  Why does it work so well?
[01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:35.473]  Because I've taken Kydo Sand.
[01:19:35.613 --> 01:19:37.436]  I've done other herbal cleanses.
[01:19:37.456 --> 01:19:38.237]  They did something.
[01:19:38.717 --> 01:19:40.280]  This is dramatic!
[01:19:41.314 --> 01:19:53.081]  Well, Howard, first of all, when I was doing my research years ago and looking for the root cause of disease, what I found was, I was looking at the medical profession saying, what are they not teaching their doctors?
[01:19:53.141 --> 01:19:58.705]  What is, you know, what is the big secret that Big Pharma never wants you to find?
[01:19:58.725 --> 01:20:00.666]  My personal trainer says, what's going on, dude?
[01:20:01.126 --> 01:20:03.208]  Your stomach has gone down by half in two weeks.
[01:20:03.248 --> 01:20:03.768]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:20:03.868 --> 01:20:13.670]  People, I mean, people will lose 10 to 15 pounds and a lot of that's compaction because you have 35 feet of intestinal tract, you know, about 10 feet of a large intestine and 25 feet of small intestine.
[01:20:14.170 --> 01:20:20.151]  And when you put toxic residue year after year after year after year, it can build up, especially in your small intestine.
[01:20:20.211 --> 01:20:32.653]  So, you know, Hollywood, this product was developed in 1998 and even people from Hollywood have used it to drop dress size, you know, one or two sizes of their dress, the women, before the Emmys and all the other things.
[01:20:33.553 --> 01:20:44.440]  The good thing about it is, yeah, it's not fat loss, it's that compacted, built-up matter that you've had that turns hard as a rock for years and years and years and years in your system.
[01:20:45.101 --> 01:20:47.542]  Just like you get plaque in your arteries, you get it in your intestines.
[01:20:47.783 --> 01:20:55.968]  The reason why I developed this product, I mean, who came up with the formula initially was Nikolai Tesla and Eugene Blass in a hotel room in 1898.
[01:20:56.268 --> 01:21:03.153]  They came up with a way to stabilize monatomic oxygen onto a magnesium compound.
[01:21:03.753 --> 01:21:22.138]  Now the reason why it works so good and what I discovered when I started doing the research and tracing back a link to every single disease and symptoms that a body can have was that health starts in the intestinal tract or colon and disease also starts in the intestinal tract and colon.
[01:21:22.938 --> 01:21:37.573]  You know, when I found out and linked all the toxins that you're taking in from food, everything that you're getting from the beverages that you drink, the acidity that comes into the bowel, I mean, every single thing starts in the intestinal lining in the bowel.
[01:21:38.314 --> 01:21:39.935]  From the time that you look at food.
[01:21:40.115 --> 01:21:42.377]  But explain how this works because at first I was kind of scared.
[01:21:42.397 --> 01:21:44.558]  I'm like, oxygen tablets is going to puff up my gut.
[01:21:44.598 --> 01:21:49.882]  You're like, no, it's designed to go through and time release with what you developed and patented.
[01:21:49.922 --> 01:21:50.582]  Explain that to people.
[01:21:50.622 --> 01:21:51.182]  It's amazing.
[01:21:51.303 --> 01:21:51.483]  Right.
[01:21:51.703 --> 01:21:54.324]  OK, so what happens is I thought it would hurt or something.
[01:21:54.364 --> 01:21:54.725]  It doesn't.
[01:21:55.245 --> 01:21:59.189]  Well, most people aren't having, you know, two to three bowel movements a day, number one, so they need help.
[01:21:59.269 --> 01:22:07.518]  I mean, the fact is, it's normal nowadays for people to have two or three bowel movements a week instead of two or three bowel movements a day like the animals.
[01:22:07.578 --> 01:22:17.007]  But how it works is, if we want to get everything out of the intestinal lining on a regular basis, I was looking at what is the best and safest way to do it.
[01:22:17.668 --> 01:22:25.011]  Started looking at, you know, the psyllium husk, the metamucil, the over-the-counter laxatives, but all those cause damage to the bowel.
[01:22:25.572 --> 01:22:32.455]  There's only one natural and safe way that you can actually oxidize, you know, those things just scrape the wall.
[01:22:32.575 --> 01:22:34.496]  Oxygen kills everything bad in the body.
[01:22:35.036 --> 01:22:42.960]  Or some of those intestinal cleansers like laxatives will suck the water into the bowel and then you can go into dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, stuff like that.
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:48.963]  But oxygen, a reactive oxygen species, is actually going to have an electron to give.
[01:22:49.003 --> 01:22:53.846]  So most of the toxins and the compaction that are in your bowel is positively charged.
[01:22:53.886 --> 01:22:57.627]  So this works in an oxidation-reduction form.
[01:22:57.647 --> 01:23:02.390]  So it actually turns the solid matter into a liquid or a gas.
[01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:05.532]  Well, think about how oxygen out in the open eats steel.
[01:23:06.252 --> 01:23:07.433]  I mean, it's really powerful.
[01:23:07.833 --> 01:23:07.973]  Right.
[01:23:08.053 --> 01:23:11.115]  So, not, I mean, we're already oxygen deficient anyway.
[01:23:11.135 --> 01:23:16.798]  I mean, we've gone from 28, 32 percent oxygen in the air down to like 6 and 9 percent sometimes in cities.
[01:23:16.838 --> 01:23:20.260]  So, we actually need more oxygen in the body.
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:25.063]  And once the oxygen goes in, once it goes in and it mixes with the hydrochloric acid in your stomach,
[01:23:25.663 --> 01:23:27.805]  Millions of little oxygen bubbles are released.
[01:23:27.825 --> 01:23:37.531]  It's kind of like that commercial, that scrubbing bubbles commercial, where it just scrubs all the way down your intestinal lining and actually oxidizes and melts away all that stuff.
[01:23:37.551 --> 01:23:40.493]  See, there's nothing else out there that's going to actually melt it away.
[01:23:41.053 --> 01:23:52.061]  The bulk fiber products that people take are just going to bulk up in the intestines and maybe scrape a little bit off the sides, but nothing's going to actually chew all the way through and melt everything down.
[01:23:52.121 --> 01:23:55.103]  And I'm already in two weeks after Anthony was like, look, just take it.
[01:23:55.703 --> 01:23:57.024]  You know, you'll want to carry it.
[01:23:57.084 --> 01:23:58.686]  This is, and I was like, really?
[01:23:58.706 --> 01:24:03.350]  Because I mean, you know, I've never messed with my guts and I've taken, you know, some of the, you know, fiber stuff.
[01:24:03.370 --> 01:24:05.652]  I don't have a lot of issues, so I didn't think I really needed it.
[01:24:05.872 --> 01:24:10.236]  Well, I guess I did have issues because it's just incredible how much weight I've lost.
[01:24:10.296 --> 01:24:12.038]  Like I said, it wasn't even really the fat.
[01:24:12.078 --> 01:24:17.162]  That's been slowly going away with exercise and, you know, supplementation and eating better.
[01:24:17.703 --> 01:24:20.445]  But this literally, just suddenly my belly got smaller.
[01:24:20.905 --> 01:24:22.327]  It literally is amazing.
[01:24:23.227 --> 01:24:25.509]  Uh, it doesn't matter if you're stressed out.
[01:24:25.549 --> 01:24:29.333]  I mean, every single disorder is associated with the gut.
[01:24:29.413 --> 01:24:31.595]  And that's what I was telling you when I was doing my research.
[01:24:31.635 --> 01:24:36.079]  I found out that the medical profession doesn't want to teach their doctors too much about the gut.
[01:24:36.139 --> 01:24:47.270]  I found, I talked to gastroenterologists that didn't even really know what was going on with the gut and how to regulate the gut because they know that if everybody finds out how simple it is
[01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:55.337]  To heal your body, prevent disease by just keeping the gut cleansed on a regular basis, then everybody would be doing it.
[01:24:55.377 --> 01:24:56.258]  I mean, it's like animals.
[01:24:56.278 --> 01:25:02.123]  You don't see constipated animals out in nature and squirrels not going to the bathroom and birds flying over and not going to the bathroom.
[01:25:02.723 --> 01:25:05.446]  But you have a constipated nation and they want it that way.
[01:25:05.466 --> 01:25:09.109]  It's one of those systems that's been put into place for eugenics.
[01:25:09.149 --> 01:25:14.134]  Bill and Melinda Gates are obsessed and have spent billions patenting everything to do with gut disorders.
[01:25:14.394 --> 01:25:14.714]  That's right.
[01:25:14.734 --> 01:25:25.477]  And we know from medical doctors that the vaccines are connected in autism to gut disorders that then obviously affects the brain because we know the gut is connected.
[01:25:25.497 --> 01:25:30.018]  70% of your immune system, 70 to 75% of your immune system is located in your gut.
[01:25:30.058 --> 01:25:33.218]  They know if you take out the gut, you take out the body.
[01:25:33.258 --> 01:25:36.599]  That's why it's so important to make sure that your gut is healthy.
[01:25:36.659 --> 01:25:38.360]  You avoid the things that damage the gut.
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:39.680]  That's why they say go with your gut.
[01:25:40.609 --> 01:25:44.914]  That's right, because everybody, you know, you might be suffering, well, think about it this way.
[01:25:46.355 --> 01:25:51.061]  95% of the pharmaceutical drugs cause constipation.
[01:25:51.421 --> 01:25:56.026]  Because they know, they don't want you to eliminate your food very fast, they want it to sit inside your system.
[01:25:56.366 --> 01:25:58.208]  Because the carbohydrates will ferment.
[01:25:58.829 --> 01:26:05.417]  The proteins will turn putrefactic, and the fats will turn rancid, and then you'll have a chemical slew inside your intestines.
[01:26:05.797 --> 01:26:09.802]  Not only that, but why are they introducing genetically modified foods with the Bt toxin?
[01:26:09.842 --> 01:26:11.384]  It burns holes through your gut.
[01:26:11.865 --> 01:26:14.388]  You know, all these... They admit it kills your regular flora.
[01:26:14.628 --> 01:26:19.273]  Why do they put starches and proteins together, you know, like bread and meats together?
[01:26:19.313 --> 01:26:21.615]  They know that that causes irregularities.
[01:26:21.776 --> 01:26:32.127]  Why do they, you know, once you put chemicals in there like MSG to make food taste better, artificial sweeteners, sugar, white flour, I mean, all of it is designed to wreak havoc on your gut.
[01:26:32.227 --> 01:26:34.629]  If you take out the gut, you take out the immune system.
[01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:36.571]  If you constipate people,
[01:26:37.452 --> 01:26:40.914]  Then you're going to have more sickness, more disease, and everything else.
[01:26:40.974 --> 01:26:54.021]  So my whole philosophy is you need to be cleansing and flushing your gut out at least two or three times a week and repairing that gut lining so your body can naturally reactivate its own self-healing mechanism.
[01:26:54.161 --> 01:27:04.547]  Well, if folks go to Infowarslife.com or Infowarsstore.com, you can find the OxyPower by Global Healing Center that Dr. Grip developed decades ago.
[01:27:04.927 --> 01:27:06.648]  This is his main flagship product.
[01:27:06.688 --> 01:27:10.390]  He's developed worldwide, and we have it at Infowarslife.com.
[01:27:10.670 --> 01:27:13.732]  When you purchase it there, you support the entire transmission.
[01:27:13.752 --> 01:27:16.173]  Again, that's Infowarslife.com.
[01:27:17.594 --> 01:27:20.438]  And we have it a little bit discounted out of the gates today for everybody.
[01:27:20.498 --> 01:27:26.687]  While you're there, try the Survival Shield X2 from the crystal iodine deep earth source that nobody else has.
[01:27:27.128 --> 01:27:30.452]  Try the super male vitality, the super female vitality.
[01:27:31.630 --> 01:27:36.875]  Quite frankly, if you go back 18 years ago when I was getting death-threaded and doing all this, I thought they'd kill me.
[01:27:36.895 --> 01:27:38.076]  I thought I'd get put in prison.
[01:27:38.516 --> 01:27:40.578]  I was working 16 hours a day on average.
[01:27:41.138 --> 01:27:44.161]  I went from being in great shape to not working out for 15 years.
[01:27:44.541 --> 01:27:47.784]  Went from 185 pounds to 270 plus pounds.
[01:27:48.365 --> 01:27:49.946]  I've gone down to 220 pounds.
[01:27:50.006 --> 01:27:54.210]  It's taken me five years of trying to change my lifestyle, trying to exercise.
[01:27:54.590 --> 01:27:56.852]  I did the lifestyle change, the exercise.
[01:27:57.333 --> 01:27:58.153]  It only made me lose 20 pounds.
[01:27:58.874 --> 01:28:08.119]  Then getting into supplements, getting into the products, InfoWars Health, InfoWars Life, getting into the iodine, getting into the super male vitality that helped get my glands in order.
[01:28:08.499 --> 01:28:12.441]  That's where the last few years, the bigger changes come, even though I'm older.
[01:28:12.841 --> 01:28:15.603]  And now that I've done the oxygen, it was like, my gosh.
[01:28:16.443 --> 01:28:19.426]  I mean, you guys would tell me every week, you'd call, hey, you gotta try that.
[01:28:19.826 --> 01:28:25.030]  Anthony would call me the last few times, two weeks ago, and go, look, man, I'm telling you, I take this stuff a couple times a week.
[01:28:25.050 --> 01:28:25.951]  You gotta take it.
[01:28:26.311 --> 01:28:27.412]  I know you're losing weight.
[01:28:27.713 --> 01:28:28.854]  This will supercharge it.
[01:28:29.114 --> 01:28:30.295]  You gotta flush your guts out.
[01:28:30.995 --> 01:28:33.317]  And quite frankly, I was like, I don't have a problem with my gut.
[01:28:34.758 --> 01:28:37.281]  And, you know, oxygen tablets in my stomach.
[01:28:37.301 --> 01:28:40.363]  And you're like, well, it will be dramatic, but, you know, it's safe.
[01:28:40.884 --> 01:28:42.005]  So I finally did it.
[01:28:43.065 --> 01:28:44.288]  And it is amazing.
[01:28:44.428 --> 01:28:46.153]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:28:46.675 --> 01:28:48.480]  This is definitely something when you get it.
[01:28:48.881 --> 01:28:50.766]  The Oxy-Powder at Infowarslife.com.
[01:28:52.301 --> 01:28:53.042]  Definitely.
[01:28:53.062 --> 01:28:57.586]  I mean, there's going to be rave reviews because I know what happened to me.
[01:28:57.906 --> 01:29:01.290]  And I'm only building up to two or three pills, you know, a couple nights a week.
[01:29:01.330 --> 01:29:03.892]  I know finally you get to what, five pills a night?
[01:29:04.473 --> 01:29:05.273]  Everybody's different.
[01:29:05.313 --> 01:29:08.096]  Just depends on, you know, your gut and who you are and what you're eating.
[01:29:08.116 --> 01:29:12.920]  You know, that's why we say take two every night until you have three to five bowel movements the following day.
[01:29:13.061 --> 01:29:16.624]  Once you have three to five bowel movements the following day, that's your recommended dose.
[01:29:16.704 --> 01:29:19.026]  And by the way, people can make jokes about this on the internet later.
[01:29:19.246 --> 01:29:20.608]  We're being serious here, folks.
[01:29:20.628 --> 01:29:21.508]  This is serious stuff.
[01:29:21.548 --> 01:29:28.114]  This is why you got so many kids that have autism, because of toxins being formed in the gut, because of the BT factor, the shots, all of it.
[01:29:28.134 --> 01:29:28.875]  This is serious.
[01:29:28.895 --> 01:29:32.178]  Listen, if you want to... People think that they don't have problems with their gut.
[01:29:32.638 --> 01:29:37.460]  10 out of 10 people, 100 out of 100, 1,000 out of 1,000 people have problems with their gut.
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:42.221]  It's linked to depression, anxiety, fatigue, weight gain.
[01:29:42.661 --> 01:29:43.841]  People have nothing to lose.
[01:29:43.882 --> 01:29:45.722]  Bottom line, it all starts from the gut.
[01:29:45.822 --> 01:29:47.122]  You're funding the operation.
[01:29:47.183 --> 01:29:48.663]  This is what the group is most proud of.
[01:29:48.703 --> 01:29:49.383]  Now I know why.
[01:29:49.923 --> 01:29:50.684]  It's over the top.

[01:29:53.764 --> 01:29:57.846]  We're going to shift gears to Ebola and a lot more coming up.
[01:29:57.866 --> 01:29:58.306]  Stay with us.
[01:29:58.846 --> 01:30:01.848]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:01.868 --> 01:30:05.570]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.053 --> 01:30:18.558]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being, and you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[01:30:18.738 --> 01:30:24.942]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[01:30:25.222 --> 01:30:30.583]  Now, our extra strength new nascent iodine formula is here, Survival Shield X2.
[01:30:30.864 --> 01:30:43.347]  Leading the way into the next generation of super high quality nascent iodine, InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200 plus million year old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[01:30:43.727 --> 01:30:50.469]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients.
[01:30:50.669 --> 01:30:51.690]  And completely vegan.
[01:30:51.810 --> 01:30:55.275]  We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 Iodine for radiation.
[01:30:55.475 --> 01:30:58.318]  Pure, clean, and sourced from deep within the Earth.

[01:31:39.887 --> 01:31:43.410]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:31:43.570 --> 01:31:47.513]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:31:47.833 --> 01:31:49.295]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:31:49.615 --> 01:31:57.201]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:31:57.481 --> 01:31:58.322]  But for how long?
[01:31:58.622 --> 01:32:04.887]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:32:05.268 --> 01:32:08.070]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:32:09.366 --> 01:32:16.414]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:32:16.514 --> 01:32:18.677]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:32:18.877 --> 01:32:23.963]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:32:24.163 --> 01:32:29.109]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:32:29.309 --> 01:32:32.370]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:32:32.630 --> 01:32:36.492]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:32:36.712 --> 01:32:40.954]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:32:41.034 --> 01:32:51.018]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:32:51.258 --> 01:32:53.779]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:32:53.959 --> 01:33:02.030]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:33:02.190 --> 01:33:06.155]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:33:38.263 --> 01:33:44.345]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:44.765 --> 01:33:47.166]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:34:04.648 --> 01:34:06.709]  Alright, Dr. Group is here with me.
[01:34:06.729 --> 01:34:08.850]  I actually had his mic on earlier coming in.
[01:34:08.910 --> 01:34:17.174]  He was talking about how the Chinese have tried to secretly get his proprietary system for Oxy-Powder.
[01:34:18.618 --> 01:34:21.479]  This is the global leader, and then I'm done talking about it.
[01:34:22.020 --> 01:34:39.128]  He has the proprietary system, others have tried to imitate it, they can't, where it opens up in the intestines and then literally blows it out of there and literally interacts with the plaques, I guess the pre-diverticula, I guess you would call it, that's in there to boil all this out.
[01:34:40.309 --> 01:34:41.710]  And it's just amazing
[01:34:42.591 --> 01:34:46.032]  That this system literally doesn't want people to know about this.
[01:34:46.373 --> 01:34:50.955]  And you were talking about talking to gastrointestinal experts, medical doctors.
[01:34:51.335 --> 01:34:52.535]  They're not even aware of it.
[01:34:53.115 --> 01:34:54.136]  Yes, that's right.
[01:34:54.176 --> 01:35:05.521]  I mean, as I was doing research and kept going further and further and further, it was amazing to me that our medical scientists, the best in the world, that supposedly know about everything in the human body,
[01:35:06.161 --> 01:35:26.083]  I still didn't know about the appendix or what the appendix does and when I was studying the intestinal tract and learning so much about how all this works and how the holes are getting burnt in there and why people aren't cleaning their intestines on a regular basis and how all this led to disease and then I stumbled across the appendix and I'm like let me pull up some medical literature on the appendix.
[01:35:26.724 --> 01:35:28.406]  You know, it's gotta be important in the body.
[01:35:28.466 --> 01:35:32.851]  It's right there at the juncture of the small intestine and the large intestine and there was nothing there.
[01:35:32.911 --> 01:35:35.794]  I was like, wait a second, why is this being hidden?
[01:35:36.055 --> 01:35:36.856]  Why is this being hidden?
[01:35:36.936 --> 01:35:39.619]  They say the appendix and the gallbladder are vestigial.
[01:35:40.239 --> 01:35:41.461]  That's obviously not true.
[01:35:41.701 --> 01:35:42.342]  No, not at all.
[01:35:42.402 --> 01:35:49.127]  I mean, I had to actually dig up Russian documents and German documents and have them translated to figure out what the appendix was.
[01:35:49.187 --> 01:35:55.792]  And then, it was just like, oh my gosh, the appendix is the microcomputer system of your whole body.
[01:35:56.032 --> 01:35:58.815]  You think your brain is, but really, it's the appendix.
[01:35:58.855 --> 01:36:05.160]  The appendix controls your neurological system, your endocrine system, all of the systems of the body.
[01:36:05.220 --> 01:36:07.862]  It tells the body what's coming in, what's going out.
[01:36:08.462 --> 01:36:12.824]  Why wouldn't your microcomputer be located in your intestines?
[01:36:12.844 --> 01:36:16.126]  That's the first exposure point to every single thing that comes into your body.
[01:36:16.726 --> 01:36:22.029]  And the appendix is what controls all that and what sends the messages and it's about the size of your penis.
[01:36:22.049 --> 01:36:28.472]  By the way, just reading medical literature every day because I'm a newshound, I've seen mainline news over the years admitting that they'd quote found cells
[01:36:29.392 --> 01:36:34.636]  In the intestines that communicate with the spine and the brain, it's all interconnected.
[01:36:34.976 --> 01:36:41.400]  That's why they say go with your gut, because your brain's communicating with your stomach, and it's literally like dinosaurs had multiple brains.
[01:36:41.761 --> 01:36:42.661]  Well, we basically do.
[01:36:43.422 --> 01:36:44.162]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:36:44.623 --> 01:36:45.283]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:36:45.343 --> 01:36:47.525]  The brain of the body is actually the appendix.
[01:36:47.725 --> 01:36:53.609]  And so what happens when the appendix becomes inflamed is that you've poisoned it and it's become inflamed.
[01:36:53.689 --> 01:36:55.470]  And so what does modern medicine do?
[01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:56.331]  They take it out.
[01:36:57.091 --> 01:36:59.191]  And then you have all kinds of health problems after that.
[01:36:59.251 --> 01:37:01.612]  I mean, that's just one... Well, they say the gallbladder is not needed.
[01:37:02.352 --> 01:37:02.612]  Right.
[01:37:02.632 --> 01:37:05.953]  But from what I've read, they know it helps detox the liver.
[01:37:06.493 --> 01:37:08.113]  It's the liver's trash can, right?
[01:37:08.333 --> 01:37:08.573]  Right.
[01:37:08.673 --> 01:37:15.995]  When the liver is congested and the liver is toxic, the gallbladder gets congested, stones start to form in the gallbladder, and then you have a gallbladder attack.
[01:37:16.195 --> 01:37:20.396]  And instead of taking medicinal herbs to loosen it up, turn those stones into
[01:37:21.056 --> 01:37:29.403]  So basically from what I've read medically, but I'm doing this in layman terms, the liver vomits out poison after it's processed back into the guts to be flushed out.
[01:37:40.973 --> 01:37:53.430]  The liver has detoxification systems, and it takes the nutrients, it takes the toxins, and converts some toxins into usable forms, or it takes the nutrients and converts them into usable forms for the body.
[01:37:53.831 --> 01:37:56.134]  The problem is, it's like an oil filter in your car.
[01:37:57.856 --> 01:38:09.263]  Don't change your oil filter and your oil filter becomes congested and the blood can't pump through it and it can't work properly, then the liver also has stones in it, which most people don't know.
[01:38:09.303 --> 01:38:11.004]  They think that the gallbladder just has stones.
[01:38:11.044 --> 01:38:14.466]  When's the last time you've seen a doctor do an ultrasound of the liver?
[01:38:14.526 --> 01:38:15.527]  They just don't do it.
[01:38:15.547 --> 01:38:16.488]  They don't want you to know.
[01:38:16.548 --> 01:38:17.588]  It's like another organ.
[01:38:17.969 --> 01:38:22.972]  The intestines and the liver are actually the two most important organs in the body.
[01:38:23.692 --> 01:38:29.355]  That need to be cleansed on a regular basis, because the liver becomes so congested, it's like high blood pressure.
[01:38:29.395 --> 01:38:46.863]  You know, when someone has high blood pressure, it's not that you have high blood pressure, it's that your liver is so congested and full of stuff that the blood can't even pump through it anymore, and the heart has to pump faster and harder to push the blood through it, so it backs up, and then all of a sudden... I was reading about the liver.
[01:38:46.943 --> 01:38:49.565]  It can be upwards of half dead and grow back.
[01:38:50.430 --> 01:38:51.771]  I mean, it is just amazing.
[01:38:52.111 --> 01:38:55.494]  Yes, and the liver regenerates itself every 90 days.
[01:38:55.554 --> 01:38:59.857]  That's why, you know, but in order to clean the liver, you need to have healthy intestines.
[01:38:59.877 --> 01:39:05.562]  That's why I always start off with intestinal cleansing and then move on to liver and gallbladder cleansing.
[01:39:06.082 --> 01:39:10.707]  And there's nothing or no symptom that can't be rectified by just cleansing your body.
[01:39:10.727 --> 01:39:12.289]  That's why people did fasting.
[01:39:12.669 --> 01:39:15.632]  That's why, you know, people do juicing and they get results.
[01:39:15.652 --> 01:39:18.335]  That's why the Bible said fast and then take herbs.
[01:39:18.375 --> 01:39:20.557]  They would eat the herbs at Passover and things like that.
[01:39:20.758 --> 01:39:21.118]  Exactly.
[01:39:21.118 --> 01:39:21.418]  Absolutely.
[01:39:21.438 --> 01:39:24.100]  I mean, the intestines is just your skin turned inside out.
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:26.421]  It's made of epithelial tissue, just like your skin.
[01:39:26.461 --> 01:39:34.205]  And as a matter of fact, when we came out with oxy powder, people with all kinds of skin conditions, especially acne, all of it started going away.
[01:39:34.345 --> 01:39:45.671]  And I had to actually sign an agreement with one of the oxy companies that came out with a patent for the little pads that you use to rub on your face.
[01:39:47.432 --> 01:39:58.395]  The oxy powder was working so good and people were writing about it online, but they had the patent for oxy and acne, so I had to actually take any claims off in referencing acne for the product.
[01:39:58.735 --> 01:40:07.376]  But the point I'm trying to make is anything that you have going on in your skin is also a direct result of what's going on in your bowel.
[01:40:07.817 --> 01:40:10.737]  So once you clean your bowel, everything starts to clean up.
[01:40:10.777 --> 01:40:13.678]  Your skin starts to clean up, the organs start to clean up.
[01:40:14.358 --> 01:40:16.100]  You start having regular bowel movements.
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:20.564]  You know, people think that they have bowel movement, one bowel movement a day is okay.
[01:40:20.924 --> 01:40:27.210]  And I talk to people all the time and they say that they drink a cup of coffee in the morning, they have a bowel movement and they're fine.
[01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:30.853]  Well, what coffee does is actually cause inflammation and irritation to the bowel.
[01:40:30.873 --> 01:40:32.655]  That's why you have that bowel movement.
[01:40:33.175 --> 01:40:36.398]  You know, people need to focus on eating clean foods, avoid
[01:40:37.259 --> 01:40:40.944]  You know, toxic beverages, avoid the MSG, avoid the GMO foods.
[01:40:40.964 --> 01:40:47.572]  You know, really what wreaks havoc on the intestinal lining is a combination of all those things, especially gluten now as well.
[01:40:47.692 --> 01:40:52.678]  So, my recommendations are, you know, clean your intestines on a regular basis.
[01:40:53.547 --> 01:41:02.572]  You know, the herbal formulas out there, if you want to use them every now and then, that's fine, but the only way you're really going to truly clean the intestines is with oxygen cleansing.
[01:41:02.612 --> 01:41:09.715]  And once your intestines are clean, and you're getting that stuff out of your body on a regular basis, it doesn't have time to soak in.
[01:41:09.975 --> 01:41:20.361]  You know, just imagine if you're taking in a thousand particles of fluoride and pesticides and endocrine-disrupting chemicals every day, and BPAs and all this other stuff, and they sit inside your intestines,
[01:41:21.081 --> 01:41:25.063]  Within three days, they have time to leak through and then go to your organs and cause disease.
[01:41:25.123 --> 01:41:37.568]  But if you're cleansing your bowel on a regular basis, those chemicals that cause the disease aren't able to get into your bloodstream and then, you know, cause you to have all the type of symptoms or develop the diseases that you might have.
[01:41:37.668 --> 01:41:40.809]  Well, I tell you, for the age you are, you look like you're ten years younger than you are.
[01:41:41.109 --> 01:41:44.891]  Yeah, and I take OxyPowder and clean my bowels all the time, but I eat healthy too.
[01:41:45.151 --> 01:41:45.911]  I eat organic.
[01:41:46.331 --> 01:41:47.832]  And water is another big thing.
[01:41:48.372 --> 01:41:51.253]  Most people are dehydrated and your bowels need water.
[01:41:51.273 --> 01:41:52.554]  You need to flush the pipe.
[01:41:53.494 --> 01:41:59.017]  Just think if you had a pipe-like trash can and you didn't have a liner in it and you threw your food in there.
[01:41:59.577 --> 01:42:05.361]  You know, every time, and then you emptied the trash can out, and the next day you threw all your food particles in there and you emptied the trash can.
[01:42:05.782 --> 01:42:10.005]  Every day would be a small layer of food particles building up on that trash can.
[01:42:10.285 --> 01:42:15.629]  And after 30 years, the trash can that was originally this big, the hole in it might be this big.
[01:42:16.269 --> 01:42:20.831]  And, you know, you're not taking that trash can and hosing it down and rinsing it out every day.
[01:42:20.871 --> 01:42:21.791]  You know, that's the problem.
[01:42:21.811 --> 01:42:25.393]  Yeah, it's all really gross, so I'm not going to get into it, but it's absolutely true.
[01:42:25.413 --> 01:42:34.237]  And it is just, it's so incredible how they've suppressed all this information because they want us sick, because they want to treat the illnesses.
[01:42:35.057 --> 01:42:36.438]  They don't want to actually get rid of them.
[01:42:36.458 --> 01:42:40.281]  They don't want to find out why breast cancer or diabetes is exploding, even though we know why.
[01:42:40.822 --> 01:42:41.783]  They want to just treat it.
[01:42:42.923 --> 01:42:43.644]  It's just incredible.
[01:42:43.704 --> 01:42:45.365]  Dr. Group is our guest.
[01:42:45.445 --> 01:42:46.166]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:42:46.586 --> 01:42:47.227]  He just joined us.
[01:42:47.247 --> 01:42:50.890]  We covered a lot of really hardcore police state news, you name it.
[01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:56.775]  Obama's set to announce all these military actions against who he armed, ISIS.
[01:42:57.115 --> 01:42:58.056]  That's coming up tonight.
[01:42:58.076 --> 01:43:02.579]  We've got Colonel Schaefer joining us in the next hour, and our reporters are going to be popping in as well.
[01:43:02.860 --> 01:43:03.980]  But while we have
[01:43:04.938 --> 01:43:05.500]  You hear with us.
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:12.497]  I want to show for TV viewers, radio listeners, and just go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to find this.
[01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:16.082]  Video model shows how Ebola will spread.
[01:43:16.202 --> 01:43:20.446]  It only takes one infection individually making it through an airport checkpoint.
[01:43:20.766 --> 01:43:29.893]  Health officials around the world are scrambling to contain the Ebola virus, and this breaks down how it could literally get to millions if just one carrier gets through.
[01:43:29.953 --> 01:43:32.215]  It's clearly gone somewhat airborne.
[01:43:32.475 --> 01:43:35.158]  That was in the medical data two years ago, mainline science.
[01:43:35.678 --> 01:43:41.403]  It's not super airborne, but it can in spit particles or mucus particles sneezed out.
[01:43:42.163 --> 01:43:48.892]  Transfer from apes to humans or in the studies from monkeys to pigs and
[01:43:50.413 --> 01:43:52.494]  A month ago this was already the biggest Ebola outbreak ever.
[01:43:52.914 --> 01:43:58.537]  Now you've got 2,300 plus deaths and half of those are in the last 21 days.
[01:43:58.937 --> 01:44:04.440]  It's reaching that exponential number because now it doesn't show up in three days if you get Ebola.
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:05.641]  It shows up in a couple weeks.
[01:44:06.701 --> 01:44:07.782]  They think it's mutating.
[01:44:07.822 --> 01:44:13.885]  We know it has a history of being genetically manipulated by different Western governments.
[01:44:14.465 --> 01:44:15.186]  Here's what I'm saying.
[01:44:16.465 --> 01:44:21.307]  We know that mass plagues have killed a third of Europe, the Black Plague.
[01:44:21.827 --> 01:44:24.227]  We know that this stuff can be real.
[01:44:24.267 --> 01:44:30.509]  We know the Spanish Flu killed tens of millions at the end of World War I. So I'm concerned about this.
[01:44:30.549 --> 01:44:32.690]  If there's a real outbreak, we're not going to be told though.
[01:44:33.390 --> 01:44:36.691]  My great uncle died last November.
[01:44:37.592 --> 01:44:39.192]  He lived across the street from my uncle.
[01:44:40.833 --> 01:44:43.233]  My aunt had taken care of my great uncle.
[01:44:44.374 --> 01:44:45.014]  My cousin
[01:44:46.250 --> 01:44:47.811]  Uh, who lived nearby.
[01:44:47.831 --> 01:44:53.875]  Uh, Peter got a respiratory issue, was home a few days, found dead in the morning.
[01:44:54.856 --> 01:44:55.977]  My uncle had taken care of him.
[01:44:56.317 --> 01:45:03.842]  He fought it for a month, and the doctors said that, there and Tyler, that it was the most full the hospital had ever been.
[01:45:04.622 --> 01:45:08.505]  With people with respiratory, they said it was bacteria, it was virus, it was a whole bunch of stuff.
[01:45:08.885 --> 01:45:13.008]  They said it was normal strep that had mutated, and it killed him.
[01:45:15.373 --> 01:45:16.973]  I mean, I'm looking at this next winter coming up.
[01:45:17.033 --> 01:45:18.074]  My dad got it.
[01:45:18.854 --> 01:45:20.354]  Hadn't been this sick in his life.
[01:45:20.394 --> 01:45:21.794]  Took him a month and a half to kick it.
[01:45:23.095 --> 01:45:25.415]  I, like an idiot, went to the medical doctor.
[01:45:25.835 --> 01:45:28.436]  They gave me antibiotics, went away for two weeks, came right back.
[01:45:28.756 --> 01:45:29.556]  I'd never been this sick.
[01:45:29.576 --> 01:45:31.236]  I'm somebody that used to get sick like every two, three years.
[01:45:33.137 --> 01:45:38.318]  Then, Dr. Group, I just went ahead and drank like three bottles of colloidal silver over a week and it went away.
[01:45:38.858 --> 01:45:40.358]  I mean, why didn't I do that to begin with?
[01:45:40.378 --> 01:45:41.739]  And I'm not saying that's a panacea.
[01:45:42.439 --> 01:45:43.159]  It's just that
[01:45:45.106 --> 01:45:50.368]  It's so incredible that we already know there's a real plague.
[01:45:50.388 --> 01:45:51.209]  They're not going to tell us.
[01:45:51.509 --> 01:45:53.290]  What do you think about the Ebola situation?
[01:45:53.550 --> 01:45:54.950]  What are you doing for you and your family?
[01:45:54.970 --> 01:45:56.691]  I'm not worried about Ebola getting here.
[01:45:56.711 --> 01:45:59.893]  I mean, it might happen, but it's certainly ravaging Africa right now.
[01:45:59.913 --> 01:46:00.353]  It's terrible.
[01:46:01.687 --> 01:46:04.528]  I mean, they're talking about ending governments, ending states over there.
[01:46:04.548 --> 01:46:05.008]  It's so bad.
[01:46:05.448 --> 01:46:06.508]  But what about a mousepox?
[01:46:06.528 --> 01:46:07.388]  What about a smallpox?
[01:46:07.408 --> 01:46:09.369]  What about a mutated black plague?
[01:46:09.529 --> 01:46:18.931]  What about a mutated, just run-of-the-mill bacteria from all the GMO, all of the antibiotics in the chickens?
[01:46:19.231 --> 01:46:20.751]  I mean, it's only a matter of time.
[01:46:20.971 --> 01:46:24.472]  We're already seeing the plagues in our kids from vaccines and stuff.
[01:46:24.492 --> 01:46:25.332]  What does your gut tell you?
[01:46:26.502 --> 01:46:33.047]  My gut and the research, just like you've been putting out, shows that we're going to be dealing with a lot of bioweapons here.
[01:46:33.067 --> 01:46:34.528]  I mean, we're already dealing with them.
[01:46:34.588 --> 01:46:37.090]  So, you know, there's a couple of different ways and solutions.
[01:46:37.130 --> 01:46:52.402]  I mean, the solution really, the strongest defense against bioweapons or any type of these viruses or mycoplasms and pleomorphic organisms, which we're seeing now that the viruses can actually change into a bacteria and that bacteria can change into a mycoplasm, etc.
[01:46:53.323 --> 01:46:55.045]  It's keeping your body clean and healthy.
[01:46:55.085 --> 01:46:58.587]  I mean, your immune system is the strongest defense against anything.
[01:46:59.788 --> 01:47:02.150]  The attack is, it's a two-fold attack.
[01:47:02.591 --> 01:47:09.716]  They attack your body, they attack your immune system, they lower it down, and the media will create fear.
[01:47:09.897 --> 01:47:13.920]  And fear creates extra cortisol production and stress.
[01:47:14.380 --> 01:47:18.023]  They know when you're stressed out and you're fearful, your immune system's gonna be down by 70%.
[01:47:18.083 --> 01:47:18.664]  So the panic
[01:47:20.225 --> 01:47:25.374]  Instead of being in charge and ready, we're supposed to just not have storable food, not have guns, wait and just panic.
[01:47:25.434 --> 01:47:25.614]  No.
[01:47:26.195 --> 01:47:33.949]  I find it more reassuring to be prepared, but you're saying being prepared and being confident is actually part of beating it.
[01:47:35.182 --> 01:47:35.682]  Well, yes!
[01:47:35.762 --> 01:47:42.264]  I mean, the thing is, a lot of people out there don't pay attention, and they just believe what they hear on mainstream news, and they're not going to be prepared.
[01:47:42.284 --> 01:47:44.165]  As a matter of fact, they're going to be in a fearful state.
[01:47:44.185 --> 01:47:44.785]  They're already.
[01:47:44.845 --> 01:47:48.727]  I talk to people every day that are scared, calling my office about Ebola outbreaks.
[01:47:48.767 --> 01:47:50.927]  Those are the people that are actually looking for natural.
[01:47:51.208 --> 01:47:53.528]  A lot of people out there are waiting for the vaccine.
[01:47:53.548 --> 01:48:01.091]  They're sitting there praying, and they're calling the CDC, and they're calling the... Notice we're seeing record weird respiratory illnesses in children.
[01:48:01.471 --> 01:48:03.113]  Right after the yearly vaccination.
[01:48:03.473 --> 01:48:07.697]  It came out last year that the whooping cough was caused by the vaccine all over the country.
[01:48:08.218 --> 01:48:08.658]  That's right.
[01:48:08.698 --> 01:48:10.119]  But they admitted it in California.
[01:48:10.220 --> 01:48:13.022]  Their medical doctors went, no, it's the vaccine.
[01:48:13.042 --> 01:48:17.126]  They're begging for a trial Ebola vaccine right now that hasn't even been proven.
[01:48:17.166 --> 01:48:18.608]  You have... From Monsanto.
[01:48:18.968 --> 01:48:26.418]  Yes, you have like 90% of the population that would line up right now at the local drugstore and get injected and not even know what's in that needle.
[01:48:26.639 --> 01:48:28.081]  Bella Molina Gates are involved in it.
[01:48:28.381 --> 01:48:28.822]  That's right.
[01:48:29.142 --> 01:48:29.342]  Yep.
[01:48:29.883 --> 01:48:32.026]  Trace back to the bioweapons, you know, facility.
[01:48:32.066 --> 01:48:33.508]  But the thing is, for the listeners,
[01:48:34.429 --> 01:48:36.911]  You know, you have the solutions in front of you.
[01:48:36.951 --> 01:48:49.518]  I mean, you've been talking about it, I talk about it, you know, stocking up on iodine, which there's never been any virus, bacteria, fungus, any organism that's ever shown a resistance to iodine, to my knowledge.
[01:48:49.718 --> 01:48:52.580]  And if anyone has it, show it to me, because I've never seen it.
[01:48:53.220 --> 01:49:01.248]  Okay, so you have a stock of iodine, you keep your intestines clean, you keep your body clean, you reduce your stress levels if you possibly can.
[01:49:01.288 --> 01:49:09.997]  I mean, you know, with meditation, you know, that's a big huge thing that contributes to, you know, living in the parasympathetic state instead of living in the sympathetic state.
[01:49:10.638 --> 01:49:14.301]  You keep a strong hand of colloidal silver around your house.
[01:49:14.381 --> 01:49:16.962]  Enough for your whole... Breathe in three seconds, breathe out five, right?
[01:49:16.982 --> 01:49:18.483]  That's been helping me a lot with anger.
[01:49:18.503 --> 01:49:18.824]  Sure, sure.
[01:49:18.924 --> 01:49:24.547]  Nine deep breaths has been shown to take you from a sympathetic state into a parasympathetic state.
[01:49:24.587 --> 01:49:33.433]  And when we're talking about, you know, digestion, you should do that before you eat, too, because a lot of times people have gut problems is that they're eating in a stressed environment.
[01:49:33.914 --> 01:49:40.158]  You know, taking nine deep breaths before you eat puts you in a situation to where your body can actually absorb food.
[01:49:40.999 --> 01:49:58.381]  So, being prepared, whether it's Ebola, smallpox, you know, any type of plague, if your immune system's strong, you have clean water, you have clean food, you have silver, oregano oil, which is broad spectrum, MMS, which is another thing that I have, Chaparral, some good antivirals,
[01:49:59.457 --> 01:50:04.378]  You're going to be in good shape and you're going to be the one that's, you and your family are going to be the ones that survive.
[01:50:05.158 --> 01:50:16.620]  You know, and unfortunately, the people that are going to be running out for the vaccines and getting on antibiotics, which is the biggest joke in the world, to put people on antibiotics when they have viral and fungal and other type of, you know.
[01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:18.140]  Well, my great uncle couldn't breathe.
[01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:19.000]  They put him in the hospital.
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:22.561]  He got back out, gave it to my family, probably, and then it killed more people.
[01:50:22.881 --> 01:50:28.462]  I mean, it just shows they admit the stuff in these hospitals is the superbugs that almost nothing can kill.
[01:50:29.002 --> 01:50:31.363]  I mean, I guess they call them immortal cell lines.
[01:50:31.743 --> 01:50:35.344]  What happens when bacteria mutate that have an immortal cell line?
[01:50:35.585 --> 01:50:40.146]  For folks that don't know what an immortal cell line is, we'll come back and talk about that on the other side.
[01:50:40.206 --> 01:50:40.767]  It's real.
[01:50:41.367 --> 01:50:50.070]  They have viral and bacterial cellular cancer cells from the 1950s that are still alive in petri dishes.
[01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:51.471]  With no food.
[01:50:52.251 --> 01:50:53.031]  They don't die.
[01:50:53.411 --> 01:50:55.092]  They're actual zombie cells.
[01:50:55.592 --> 01:50:57.473]  What happens if we get zombie bacteria?
[01:50:58.860 --> 01:51:01.903]  It'll end up being like the Andromeda Strain.
[01:51:01.943 --> 01:51:07.870]  I mean, I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, that that's what we're dealing here with, and it's just crazy.
[01:51:07.890 --> 01:51:08.531]  We'll be right back.

[01:54:01.868 --> 01:54:04.590]  Or visit us at mypatriotsupply.com.
[01:54:04.710 --> 01:54:07.953]  Remember, before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.
[01:54:31.374 --> 01:54:32.435]  Some good news and some bad news.
[01:54:32.455 --> 01:54:34.536]  It's four to six weeks until the DNA Force is in.
[01:54:34.556 --> 01:54:35.677]  It'll probably sell out in a day.
[01:54:35.697 --> 01:54:37.838]  But next time I'll try to produce enough.
[01:54:38.919 --> 01:54:40.059]  It's crazy.
[01:54:42.581 --> 01:54:44.863]  Of course, there have been famous cases of...
[01:54:46.199 --> 01:54:50.280]  These immortal cell lines, you can just Google that and it'll be encyclopedias.
[01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:58.062]  In fact, I'm showing viewers an electron microscope scan of immortal cell lines, basically cancer that never dies.
[01:54:58.682 --> 01:55:07.424]  And the globalists are big into researching this, trying to find the key to immortality was a black lady named Henrietta Lacks.
[01:55:08.004 --> 01:55:08.144]  That's
[01:55:27.372 --> 01:55:30.774]  Dr. Group, so many disasters have come out of just raw research.
[01:55:31.094 --> 01:55:37.138]  These gene guns they've got, firing DNA and RNA into animal genetics, trying to create mutations.
[01:55:37.678 --> 01:55:45.562]  God knows when this stuff's going to get out of control, and I think it is going to be Mother Nature's, God's balance, that'll end up taking it out.
[01:55:45.963 --> 01:55:48.224]  I'm afraid of what the establishment's going to do.
[01:55:48.244 --> 01:55:53.267]  I mean, does Barack Obama think he's safe in a bunker from some type of nanotech bacteria?
[01:55:55.003 --> 01:56:01.885]  I think that he doesn't even know a lot of, you know, what some of the higher up people than him know.
[01:56:01.905 --> 01:56:08.588]  I think that they do, well, I have verified that there is frequency-based equipment.
[01:56:08.608 --> 01:56:11.729]  It goes back to Royal Raymond Rife, who developed
[01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:18.736]  There's a lot of kook stuff out there and people taking advantage of it, but the technology is real.
[01:56:18.916 --> 01:56:22.440]  The Queen of England gets frequency treatments.
[01:56:22.780 --> 01:56:26.524]  There's a lot of ways to deal with erratic cell lines and cell lines.
[01:56:26.944 --> 01:56:34.933]  They use viral particles to transfer these cell lines into your own RNA and DNA and that's when it becomes a problem because when your cells replicate
[01:56:35.273 --> 01:56:39.863]  When your RNA and DNA get altered, and then your cell replicates, it's there.
[01:56:40.004 --> 01:56:42.369]  I mean, it's a pattern in your RNA and DNA.
[01:56:42.409 --> 01:56:43.271]  It's hard to get rid of.
[01:56:44.195 --> 01:56:55.760]  You know, yes, you can keep your body clean and you can, you know, reduce, take cell fusion and work at the cellular level to decrease the ability of your telomeres to shorten.
[01:56:56.261 --> 01:57:09.947]  But the way to, I think, the wave of the future and what we've been looking into, I was on the original Reif research team back in 1998 that was evaluating some of his research and I actually owned Reif's original lab manual.
[01:57:10.387 --> 01:57:21.634]  Now he had a high-powered microscope that could actually view virus and bacteria and saw that those bacteria and viruses were changing form and that's when he developed certain frequencies.
[01:57:22.314 --> 01:57:23.495]  You've done so many interesting things.
[01:57:23.515 --> 01:57:25.216]  We should do a whole show on that lab you owned.
[01:57:25.236 --> 01:57:26.196]  That is incredible.
[01:57:26.516 --> 01:57:27.317]  Right, yeah.
[01:57:27.437 --> 01:57:39.044]  I actually donated a lot of stuff to the World Research Foundation because I was afraid someone was going to break in and steal it from me because I had Reif's original notes in my hand and a lot of other stuff too that
[01:57:40.083 --> 01:57:44.627]  You know, government officials would have liked to have gotten their hands on, so... We know they rated Tesla.
[01:57:45.088 --> 01:57:58.881]  They do, and Tesla's technology is, you know, hopefully some of that's coming out now, and more of it will come out, but... Suppressed by the Rockefellers and by the other supposed inventors.
[01:57:59.682 --> 01:58:01.384]  JPMorgan and others for a long time.
[01:58:01.744 --> 01:58:14.515]  Yeah, and I think in the future, you know, when we get attacked with all this stuff, we're being attacked right now, you know, that's why we're trying to give people, you know, develop the InfoWars Life product line so people can protect themselves.
[01:58:14.555 --> 01:58:18.379]  You know, that's a whole other show, because Nico just popped in my head and reminded me it was JPMorgan mainly.
[01:58:18.799 --> 01:58:23.043]  JPMorgan that literally runs the New World Order has all that secret technology on record.
[01:58:23.283 --> 01:58:23.563]  They did.
[01:58:23.583 --> 01:58:24.784]  They with the FBI got it.
[01:58:24.964 --> 01:58:26.864]  I mean, that's mainstream television amidst that.
[01:58:27.404 --> 01:58:27.585]  Right.
[01:58:27.645 --> 01:58:28.865]  I mean, they've got all that stuff.
[01:58:28.925 --> 01:58:30.165]  It's just, just incredible.
[01:58:30.205 --> 01:58:32.766]  Thomas Edison, what a joke compared to Tesla.
[01:58:33.147 --> 01:58:34.127]  And Tesla probably had like a 300 IQ.
[01:58:34.147 --> 01:58:36.188]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:58:37.108 --> 01:58:37.688]  It is a joke.
[01:58:37.728 --> 01:58:46.811]  I mean, the technology that they have at the underground facilities that have been built all over the United States are technologies where they can transfer frequencies and use frequencies on cell phones.
[01:58:46.831 --> 01:58:47.071]  Stay there.
[01:58:47.091 --> 01:58:47.692]  Five more minutes.
[01:58:47.752 --> 01:58:48.292]  It's amazing.

[01:59:34.295 --> 01:59:38.938]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:59:39.058 --> 01:59:40.059]  Talk about the effects.
[01:59:40.379 --> 01:59:41.880]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[01:59:41.900 --> 01:59:43.562]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[01:59:43.802 --> 01:59:44.863]  I feel like I look better.
[01:59:44.923 --> 01:59:45.563]  I feel better.
[01:59:45.583 --> 01:59:46.704]  I feel sexier.
[01:59:46.724 --> 01:59:47.425]  I love it.
[01:59:47.685 --> 01:59:50.587]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[01:59:50.647 --> 01:59:53.390]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.

[02:00:22.277 --> 02:00:23.198]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.819 --> 02:00:27.442]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:28.002 --> 02:00:32.066]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:42.540 --> 02:00:44.481]  By the way, folks, I don't make stuff up.
[02:00:44.662 --> 02:00:45.242]  People know that.
[02:00:45.262 --> 02:00:46.263]  Occasionally, I make a mistake.
[02:00:46.303 --> 02:00:51.767]  I told you it would take 12 weeks to get more DNA for us, because we've got to buy some of the stuff from Mitsubishi and others.
[02:00:52.547 --> 02:00:56.430]  And then the FDA is involved, and it's like $12,000 a kilo.
[02:00:56.490 --> 02:00:59.933]  I mean, these really are superior products.
[02:01:02.375 --> 02:01:07.638]  We bought most of the Oxy Powder, which is his flagship product at the Global Healing Center.
[02:01:08.458 --> 02:01:14.741]  So, at the rate it's selling, it may all sell out, but then he can probably make it quicker, but it could be out for a few weeks.
[02:01:15.161 --> 02:01:19.864]  So, if you want your Oxy Powder, Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:01:19.984 --> 02:01:25.387]  That's what's great about my listeners knowing that I tell the truth and I mean what I'm saying.
[02:01:26.451 --> 02:01:27.892]  I just wear the truth on my sleeve.
[02:01:28.332 --> 02:01:35.395]  We're funding our operation, selling high quality products that are revolutionary, so that people keep buying them and want more to fund us telling the truth.
[02:01:35.455 --> 02:01:36.415]  I mean, it's real simple.
[02:01:36.575 --> 02:01:38.076]  I don't sell something I don't use.
[02:01:38.596 --> 02:01:42.898]  I would never sell this, you've been trying to get me to for two years, because I'm like, oxygen pills in my gut?
[02:01:43.318 --> 02:01:45.559]  I just, it sounded weird, and I'm ignorant.
[02:01:45.820 --> 02:01:46.320]  I admit it.
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:47.680]  You were right!
[02:01:47.781 --> 02:01:49.121]  It's the best product you've got!
[02:01:49.141 --> 02:01:55.084]  And, uh, it's, it's... I mean, hell, when you lose ten pounds in two weeks, and people are like, what's going on?
[02:01:55.104 --> 02:01:57.045]  I mean, it's, it's amazing!
[02:01:57.325 --> 02:01:57.566]  I know.
[02:01:57.586 --> 02:01:58.886]  I didn't mean to go off on a jag.
[02:01:58.906 --> 02:01:59.787]  I wanted to get into Tesla.
[02:01:59.827 --> 02:02:06.030]  I walked in today, and since the last time I was in the studio, probably about a month ago, and I was like, oh my gosh, look how much weight you've lost.
[02:02:06.070 --> 02:02:11.593]  Yeah, I mean, I gotta take the shirt off, because, I mean, you know, I mean, I got a big torso, so I sit down, there's still a little bit of a belly, but standing up, it's gone.
[02:02:12.053 --> 02:02:12.293]  Yeah!
[02:02:12.373 --> 02:02:13.534]  I mean, it's gone.
[02:02:13.574 --> 02:02:14.074]  You look great.
[02:02:14.214 --> 02:02:15.075]  I mean, it's just, I mean...
[02:02:16.144 --> 02:02:17.025]  Soon as I lose more weight.
[02:02:17.065 --> 02:02:18.065]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[02:02:18.125 --> 02:02:18.666]  Here's the thing.
[02:02:18.706 --> 02:02:21.847]  With OxyPowder, you see results.
[02:02:22.028 --> 02:02:22.928]  You can look online.
[02:02:22.948 --> 02:02:25.510]  There's thousands and thousands of reviews out there.
[02:02:26.270 --> 02:02:28.792]  You start noticing a difference the next day.
[02:02:29.881 --> 02:02:32.002]  I mean, I was a total fat ass just a year ago.
[02:02:32.022 --> 02:02:34.942]  Wait till I take my clothes off, man.
[02:02:35.303 --> 02:02:36.463]  Yeah, you'll be ripped solid.
[02:02:36.483 --> 02:02:39.384]  I mean, it's amazing what happens when you get rid of all that junk in your gut.
[02:02:39.424 --> 02:02:43.445]  I mean, the thing is, you can take this tonight, and I recommend people take it at night before they go to bed.
[02:02:43.525 --> 02:02:50.947]  So, they're laying down slowly, it's chewing through all that stuff, they get up in the morning, they have a few bowel movements, all of it comes out.
[02:02:51.767 --> 02:02:54.629]  And you're energized in the morning when you wake up?
[02:02:54.689 --> 02:02:55.429]  I am energized.
[02:02:55.449 --> 02:02:56.570]  Actually get out of bed?
[02:02:56.590 --> 02:03:00.653]  I worked out for almost two hours this morning, even though I had important stuff to do.
[02:03:01.133 --> 02:03:03.474]  An hour and 45, usually an hour is grueling.
[02:03:03.814 --> 02:03:05.035]  I just wanted to do more.
[02:03:05.976 --> 02:03:08.197]  That's the extra oxygen that's going into your system.
[02:03:08.237 --> 02:03:08.797]  It's amazing.
[02:03:08.837 --> 02:03:16.362]  I mean, you feel stronger, you're energized, you sleep better at night, and you just, in the morning, it's just like, woof, you flush everything out of there.
[02:03:16.382 --> 02:03:19.624]  The guys have said the last two weeks that I have more clarity on air.
[02:03:19.964 --> 02:03:21.045]  Guys, have you not been saying that?
[02:03:22.517 --> 02:03:23.057]  He's turning his mind.
[02:03:23.077 --> 02:03:23.337]  Every day?
[02:03:23.357 --> 02:03:24.598]  He didn't even know he was coming.
[02:03:24.658 --> 02:03:25.839]  I mean, it's really working.
[02:03:27.039 --> 02:03:28.740]  It, I mean, it is amazing.
[02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:30.902]  But it's the fusion of the iodine and everything.
[02:03:31.342 --> 02:03:31.922]  It's everything.
[02:03:31.942 --> 02:03:39.166]  Look, we've, this product, OxyPowder, for example, has actually gone through phase one, two, and three clinical trials.
[02:03:39.426 --> 02:03:43.789]  FDA approved clinical trials for constipation and irritable bowel syndrome.
[02:03:44.049 --> 02:03:45.189]  People are suffering from gas.
[02:03:46.510 --> 02:03:48.151]  Yeah, no, this is huge.
[02:03:48.171 --> 02:03:52.435]  I mean, this is like, if you have a solution to, if you can address and attack the root cause of all disease,
[02:04:06.866 --> 02:04:08.127]  Which is the intestinal lining.
[02:04:08.227 --> 02:04:19.452]  All the other stuff is great, but this actually works on preventing all of the stuff that cause disease and symptoms from entering your body and keeps the most important system in your body.
[02:04:19.893 --> 02:04:22.034]  The intestines are the biggest endocrine gland.
[02:04:22.574 --> 02:04:24.735]  You know, they regulate serotonin.
[02:04:24.995 --> 02:04:27.717]  When you're stressed out, you know, it affects the intestines.
[02:04:28.017 --> 02:04:30.238]  Everything in your body starts from the intestinal tract.
[02:04:30.599 --> 02:04:39.324]  If you can keep it clean a couple times a week, increase the oxygen content into your intestines, drink more water... Well, we know cancer doesn't like oxygen.
[02:04:40.051 --> 02:04:41.272]  We know cancer doesn't like that.
[02:04:41.292 --> 02:04:43.293]  It's an anaerobic cell line.
[02:04:43.374 --> 02:04:46.276]  So when you, you know, it'd be interesting to see.
[02:04:46.576 --> 02:04:51.139]  I've never heard a report from anybody, and we've had people taking this product for close to 20 years.
[02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:55.863]  I've never had a report of anybody developing colon cancer while on this product.
[02:04:55.903 --> 02:04:57.424]  I've never ever had that happen.
[02:04:57.444 --> 02:05:04.829]  Now, I'm not saying and making any claims, but if you keep your intestines, that's the best way to prevent anything.
[02:05:04.889 --> 02:05:06.150]  You mean 2 plus 2 equals 4?
[02:05:06.210 --> 02:05:07.712]  Pretty much.
[02:05:07.732 --> 02:05:08.772]  That's kind of racist.
[02:05:08.812 --> 02:05:09.393]  Thank you, Dr. Grubb.
[02:05:10.649 --> 02:05:14.152]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:05:14.312 --> 02:05:18.275]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:18.595 --> 02:05:20.057]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:05:20.377 --> 02:05:27.963]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.

[02:06:10.351 --> 02:06:16.461]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:06:16.701 --> 02:06:19.202]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:06:19.242 --> 02:06:26.026]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:06:26.287 --> 02:06:29.148]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:06:29.268 --> 02:06:32.210]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:06:32.230 --> 02:06:34.231]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:06:34.251 --> 02:06:37.093]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:06:37.193 --> 02:06:42.675]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:06:42.895 --> 02:06:46.397]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:06:46.417 --> 02:06:49.398]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[02:07:10.168 --> 02:07:18.654]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being, and you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[02:07:18.834 --> 02:07:25.039]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[02:07:25.339 --> 02:07:29.102]  Now, our extra strength new nascent iodine formula is here.
[02:07:29.342 --> 02:07:30.723]  Survival Shield X2.

[02:07:40.750 --> 02:07:43.412]  Found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[02:07:43.832 --> 02:07:51.798]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients, and completely vegan.

[02:08:14.002 --> 02:08:16.203]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:08:16.423 --> 02:08:19.103]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:08:19.143 --> 02:08:23.244]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:23.505 --> 02:08:32.667]  This magic moment So different and so new was like any other
[02:08:34.585 --> 02:08:36.326]  Alright, here's what I want to do.
[02:08:36.366 --> 02:08:43.508]  I am really working as hard as I can on this syndicated broadcast.
[02:09:06.007 --> 02:09:12.451]  Radio slash TV to work in as many of the nightly news reports as we can into the show.
[02:09:13.352 --> 02:09:20.657]  Now about half the time we end up airing these reports minutes after they're done on this radio show first.
[02:09:21.497 --> 02:09:27.281]  So a lot of it you will hear or see here first, about half of it, but a lot of it ends up going out on the nightly news.
[02:09:27.701 --> 02:09:28.422]  Tomorrow
[02:09:29.713 --> 02:09:37.279]  I will do an entire fourth hour of radio slash TV, but the fourth hour will be in the new studio.
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:39.741]  So I'll do three hours in here.
[02:09:40.662 --> 02:09:44.365]  And then for those that like a train wreck, I don't think that's going to happen, but the guys are nervous.
[02:09:45.026 --> 02:09:50.290]  We're going to go over in the new studio and tweak audio and some other stuff because we've done the news out of there for a while.
[02:09:51.792 --> 02:09:53.815]  It's different, you know, doing a 30-minute show.
[02:09:54.155 --> 02:09:55.337]  Most of it's taped to air.
[02:09:55.698 --> 02:10:00.204]  Sometimes we go live afterwards, like when there's key news stories.
[02:10:00.584 --> 02:10:03.028]  We do a lot of live stuff out of there, but it's still different.
[02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:05.801]  To some degree.
[02:10:06.201 --> 02:10:07.042]  I really don't think so.
[02:10:07.102 --> 02:10:12.506]  So tomorrow, fourth hour, the entire fourth hour of Overdrive in the new studio.
[02:10:13.007 --> 02:10:16.830]  And we're very close to firing up some satellite feeds and making some big announcements.
[02:10:17.391 --> 02:10:21.054]  I've gotten behind with a lot of family issues that have been going on the last year.
[02:10:21.074 --> 02:10:22.555]  Let me tell you, when it rains, it pours.
[02:10:23.076 --> 02:10:28.741]  All hell, excuse my French, has been breaking loose in my family on multiple fronts.
[02:10:30.021 --> 02:10:33.322]  And thank God that's cleared up and got better.
[02:10:33.402 --> 02:10:37.163]  Deaths in the family, illnesses, you name it, it's been going on.
[02:10:37.243 --> 02:10:41.484]  Cats and dogs, you know, raining from the sky to quote Ghostbusters.
[02:10:42.404 --> 02:10:44.085]  Wrath of God type of stuff, I'm joking.
[02:10:44.425 --> 02:10:46.045]  Actually, best of times, worst of times.
[02:10:46.305 --> 02:10:47.726]  We've never been more blessed.
[02:10:48.066 --> 02:10:53.187]  There's been just great wondrous things of prosperity and providence happening.
[02:10:54.557 --> 02:10:57.259]  But for everything, there's a season, there's also been some bad stuff.
[02:10:57.279 --> 02:10:58.960]  So I appreciate all your prayers.
[02:10:59.060 --> 02:11:03.764]  That's why we're behind six months or more on a lot of initiatives around here.
[02:11:04.164 --> 02:11:07.086]  Obama deception, two, that's about a year behind.
[02:11:07.106 --> 02:11:09.268]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:11:09.288 --> 02:11:11.189]  We're trying as best we can.
[02:11:12.530 --> 02:11:16.253]  We're trying as best we can to bring you teleprompter-free real news.
[02:11:16.914 --> 02:11:23.679]  One reason mainstream news is so controlled is the corporate execs want to be able to dominate outcomes and not have any liability.
[02:11:24.989 --> 02:11:38.724]  So, centrally stuff is written by a handful of folks, like CBS Broadcast Center, until about five years ago, did most of the news for Fox, CNN, ABC, and NBC.
[02:11:38.764 --> 02:11:39.625]  You can look this up.
[02:11:40.826 --> 02:11:45.170]  And they had thousands of writers and propagandists, and the CIA was there.
[02:11:46.645 --> 02:11:53.809]  And CBS would then prepare even the news packages for most of the other local stations that weren't even CBS affiliates.
[02:11:54.369 --> 02:12:00.232]  And so that's why I would see a CBS news piece saying, Mercury is good for your children.
[02:12:02.354 --> 02:12:02.814]  Locally.
[02:12:02.834 --> 02:12:08.357]  And then I would see ABC with the exact same words in the exact same order nationally.
[02:12:09.229 --> 02:12:15.173]  And then I would tune to Fox locally, I did reports on this at the time, and Show Out was the exact same words, exact same time.
[02:12:15.533 --> 02:12:23.118]  It's not just the big three networks, people kept saying, it's the same stories, in the same order, with the same advertisers.
[02:12:24.578 --> 02:12:27.921]  Because it literally has been one conglomerate for a long time.
[02:12:28.881 --> 02:12:31.663]  Now CBS Broadcast Center in Manhattan doesn't run at all now.
[02:12:35.085 --> 02:12:36.586]  It's complex, but it's also simple.
[02:12:36.946 --> 02:12:40.387]  It makes your head spin, folks, when you know how things really work.
[02:12:41.508 --> 02:12:45.309]  Imagine being me in 2004.
[02:12:49.610 --> 02:13:02.655]  Back then, when I was at home, I would tape the news, and then I would go to the radio studio that was just like four or five people at the time, and I would say, grab it off VHS, it's here, and then we would play it.
[02:13:04.144 --> 02:13:08.947]  A lot of times it was quicker to dump to a tape deck than to a CD or a computer.
[02:13:08.967 --> 02:13:11.349]  The computers would lock up and stuff, even with audio.
[02:13:12.089 --> 02:13:14.611]  And then we'd grab a clip off CBS.
[02:13:16.963 --> 02:13:19.925]  And then we'd play it where they were saying, Mercury's good for your kids.
[02:13:19.945 --> 02:13:30.232]  And then I'd go do my AXS show, this is in 2004, and I would pop in the VHS a lot of times in the control room myself and go, look, they're saying Mercury's good, and I'd hit the button and play it.
[02:13:30.912 --> 02:13:34.114]  Those clips are on YouTube today with hundreds of thousands of views.
[02:13:35.495 --> 02:13:37.917]  Just a testament to me in an AXS TV studio in 2004.
[02:13:38.017 --> 02:13:43.721]  I mean, we were already on probably 70-something affiliates in 2004.
[02:13:43.981 --> 02:13:45.182]  I had a big radio footprint.
[02:13:46.602 --> 02:13:53.477]  I just hadn't learned yet how to make money to be able to hire reporters and get more professional.
[02:13:53.697 --> 02:13:55.120]  In fact, I wanted to stay small.
[02:13:56.297 --> 02:13:58.378]  I wanted to not have to hire more than five or six people.
[02:13:58.678 --> 02:13:59.718]  I didn't like making money.
[02:13:59.918 --> 02:14:01.739]  I didn't run ads on my website.
[02:14:02.079 --> 02:14:06.681]  I would plug my videos a few times a day to try to sell films.
[02:14:07.141 --> 02:14:18.284]  And then I did PrisonPlanet.tv in like 2002 or so to get some members so I could buy cameras and have money to send a reporter on a trip, that reporter being me.
[02:14:19.225 --> 02:14:22.406]  And then I realized the government's coming after me, the mainstream media's coming after me.
[02:14:22.806 --> 02:14:24.346]  I'm reaching millions of people.
[02:14:24.887 --> 02:14:25.527]  I'm a leader.
[02:14:27.617 --> 02:14:29.718]  I have a responsibility to be on air.
[02:14:29.998 --> 02:14:32.440]  I have a responsibility to try to be reaching people.
[02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:33.800]  And to try to get big.
[02:14:34.181 --> 02:14:36.482]  Because little fish get eaten by big fish.
[02:14:37.643 --> 02:14:39.003]  And we now are pretty good-sized fish.
[02:14:39.043 --> 02:14:42.045]  We need to get a lot bigger, folks, because we're going up against the big sharks.
[02:14:43.186 --> 02:14:47.888]  But we got God on our side and hope and a prayer, and that'll get you pretty far in this world if you're doing the right thing.
[02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:52.191]  And the reason I bring that up, I didn't even mean to bring that up, was I noticed
[02:14:53.319 --> 02:14:58.441]  The COINTELPRO on YouTube and everywhere else says, how dare Alex Jones sell a book or a video or a pro-gun t-shirt?
[02:14:58.741 --> 02:14:59.762]  How dare you sell something?
[02:15:00.142 --> 02:15:07.585]  When the globalists take your tax money, give it to NPR, give it to MSNBC, and then sell anti-gun, anti-liberty stuff.
[02:15:08.045 --> 02:15:09.646]  I am proud to make money.
[02:15:10.006 --> 02:15:11.467]  I am proud to hire people.
[02:15:11.807 --> 02:15:13.308]  I am proud to expand.
[02:15:13.688 --> 02:15:15.288]  I am proud to reach more people.
[02:15:15.569 --> 02:15:17.029]  I am proud to be successful.
[02:15:18.150 --> 02:15:21.211]  It shows how screwed up it is to say if you have a business, you didn't build it.
[02:15:22.608 --> 02:15:26.477]  First and foremost, we're a mission to reach people and tell the truth and fight tyranny.
[02:15:28.854 --> 02:15:31.455]  But we obviously have to be a business to support ourselves.
[02:15:31.776 --> 02:15:47.784]  But I think about myself in 2001, 2002, literally having a business plan to not make money and being upset when we had extra money because it meant that I had to expand the operation until I went, wait a minute, that's mind control.
[02:15:48.484 --> 02:15:51.206]  I need to, I want to build up to 300 people.
[02:15:51.666 --> 02:15:53.587]  I want to have a billion viewers.
[02:15:54.607 --> 02:15:55.468]  I want to win!
[02:15:57.881 --> 02:15:58.722]  What a mind game!
[02:15:58.782 --> 02:16:02.384]  So I, folks, I used to sit here and attack the police almost every show.
[02:16:03.904 --> 02:16:05.786]  Because I was playing into the mind control.
[02:16:05.826 --> 02:16:09.948]  Yeah, the police have been given bad training, programming, federalized, globalized.
[02:16:10.488 --> 02:16:13.410]  So then when they act bad, the feds come in as the saviors and take them over.
[02:16:13.650 --> 02:16:23.616]  The mainstream media shows all the bad cop stuff to then create an us-against-them mentality so they can basically have a soft civil war in this country and drive the cops into the hands of the globalists.
[02:16:24.514 --> 02:16:27.655]  It's not that I don't get mad at bad cops or criminals that are cops or things.
[02:16:28.235 --> 02:16:29.036]  We try to change it.
[02:16:29.356 --> 02:16:31.236]  But you don't change it just hating the police.
[02:16:31.716 --> 02:16:33.037]  And I'm not preaching at people.
[02:16:33.717 --> 02:16:36.778]  I didn't know that until about 5, 6, 7, 8 years ago.
[02:16:37.458 --> 02:16:38.379]  I'm learning.
[02:16:39.119 --> 02:16:40.019]  And that's what I'm saying.
[02:16:40.179 --> 02:16:41.800]  Fighting tyranny is a process.
[02:16:43.421 --> 02:16:49.223]  InfoWars is a media laboratory of what would happen if people tried to promote freedom and tell the truth?
[02:16:49.583 --> 02:16:51.363]  What would happen if we were aggressive about it?
[02:16:51.603 --> 02:16:53.204]  What would happen if we were open about it?
[02:16:54.246 --> 02:16:54.887]  What would happen?
[02:16:55.007 --> 02:16:55.548]  This is it.
[02:16:55.568 --> 02:16:56.589]  This is it.
[02:16:56.909 --> 02:16:58.391]  What you're seeing, this is it.
[02:17:00.394 --> 02:17:01.575]  We built it, they came.
[02:17:02.591 --> 02:17:03.431]  We're not perfect.
[02:17:03.451 --> 02:17:04.391]  We've got a lot of problems.
[02:17:04.692 --> 02:17:07.072]  But we are the model of the next level.
[02:17:07.672 --> 02:17:14.154]  And if other people out there get off the establishment reservation that's sinking anyways, we can save this culture and this society.
[02:17:14.434 --> 02:17:18.615]  So I want to work in more of the reports here on air as a fusion of information.
[02:17:18.935 --> 02:17:20.976]  Let's play Jakari Jackson's short report.
[02:17:20.996 --> 02:17:24.657]  I mean, there's upwards of seven or eight of these reports a night in the nightly news.
[02:17:24.997 --> 02:17:26.997]  It's so much better than the radio show in so many ways.
[02:17:27.278 --> 02:17:28.758]  But this is better in other ways as well.
[02:17:29.858 --> 02:17:31.039]  Well, have you talked to the school nurse?
[02:17:31.059 --> 02:17:32.179]  No, she doesn't know anything.
[02:17:32.279 --> 02:17:33.640]  Will you just come get me?
[02:17:33.680 --> 02:17:33.740]  No.
[02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:35.961]  Oh, will you do me a favor then?
[02:17:35.981 --> 02:17:36.081]  What?
[02:17:36.101 --> 02:17:37.282]  Can you bring me my chapstick?
[02:17:54.781 --> 02:17:56.162]  But my lips hurt real bad!
[02:17:56.422 --> 02:17:57.964]  Just passed her from the school nurse.
[02:17:58.024 --> 02:18:00.005]  I know she has like five sticks in her drawer.
[02:18:00.025 --> 02:18:01.807]  I'm not gonna use hers, you sicko!
[02:18:02.887 --> 02:18:03.208]  See ya.
[02:18:07.808 --> 02:18:12.650]  As bizarre as that scene was, a similar event has now actually taken place.
[02:18:13.191 --> 02:18:18.033]  In Virginia, an 11-year-old was told that she couldn't have ChapStick without a doctor's note.
[02:18:18.573 --> 02:18:22.915]  And even if she did produce the prescription, the nurse would have to apply it for her.
[02:18:23.395 --> 02:18:26.657]  It seems that zero tolerance also applies to common sense.
[02:18:27.157 --> 02:18:30.379]  And let us not forget the case of the infamous Pop-Tart gun.
[02:18:30.839 --> 02:18:34.600]  Where a boy in Maryland was suspended after eating his pastry the wrong way.
[02:18:35.081 --> 02:18:39.562]  A school staffer claims that the boy used the gun to imitate a gun sound.
[02:18:40.102 --> 02:18:41.223]  And so what if he did?
[02:18:41.623 --> 02:18:42.963]  But there is hope, though.
[02:18:43.464 --> 02:18:49.546]  Sixth graders in Arkansas were given the task of deciding which of our God-given rights the government should allow us to have.
[02:18:50.006 --> 02:18:54.188]  So if I lose my right to bear arms, hopefully I'll gain my right to bear a lip balm.
[02:18:54.608 --> 02:18:57.729]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[02:18:58.840 --> 02:19:05.165]  And that's just the type of little news giblets where we take incredible news that's happening and point out the rest of the story.
[02:19:06.026 --> 02:19:09.108]  Zero tolerance is about total mindlessness.
[02:19:09.548 --> 02:19:11.230]  It's about shutting down real debate.
[02:19:12.611 --> 02:19:15.673]  Oh, you can't have Luden's cough drops even though they're just candy.
[02:19:16.474 --> 02:19:18.375]  Oh, you can't have ChapStick, it's a drug.
[02:19:18.675 --> 02:19:19.136]  No, it's not.
[02:19:19.416 --> 02:19:20.397]  It's over-the-counter.
[02:19:20.537 --> 02:19:21.518]  It's not even a drug.
[02:19:21.998 --> 02:19:22.258]  It's cream.
[02:19:24.798 --> 02:19:30.889]  It's about turning our kids into prisoners and raising the bar so high that they're all basically criminals.
[02:19:32.270 --> 02:19:35.831]  Suspending kids that are seen playing with Nerf guns in their yard from school.
[02:19:36.291 --> 02:19:37.472]  That's not zero tolerance.
[02:19:37.532 --> 02:19:38.992]  That's a school out of control.
[02:19:39.252 --> 02:19:42.773]  That's a cult trying to henpeck everyone into submission.
[02:19:43.474 --> 02:19:46.835]  And also what we do at InfoWorks Nightly News is we hijack memes.
[02:19:47.275 --> 02:19:49.616]  That spider dog got like 50 million views or whatever.
[02:19:49.936 --> 02:19:54.597]  We hijacked it, put out two reports that have got about 150,000 views just on YouTube alone.
[02:19:54.917 --> 02:19:56.238]  That's just one quick thing we did.
[02:19:57.276 --> 02:19:59.919]  So I'm trying to teach alternative media out there how you can do it.
[02:20:00.179 --> 02:20:08.608]  You can grab the mindless fluff that doesn't matter, hijack it, and then add real news about real spider goats to it to educate people.
[02:20:10.046 --> 02:20:12.628]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[02:20:12.768 --> 02:20:16.771]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[02:20:17.072 --> 02:20:18.313]  Silverlungs.com.
[02:20:18.473 --> 02:20:20.955]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[02:20:21.155 --> 02:20:23.957]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[02:20:24.157 --> 02:20:26.299]  The Silverlungs generator allows you to make your own.
[02:20:26.499 --> 02:20:28.261]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[02:20:28.401 --> 02:20:33.745]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[02:20:33.965 --> 02:20:37.608]  See the Silverlungs generator and lung delivery system at Silverlungs.com.
[02:20:37.748 --> 02:20:39.309]  That's silverlungs.com.
[02:20:39.569 --> 02:20:48.814]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:20:48.874 --> 02:20:49.594]  This capitalism?
[02:20:49.654 --> 02:20:55.777]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:20:55.817 --> 02:20:59.459]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[02:21:06.883 --> 02:21:07.123]  I think?

[02:21:34.692 --> 02:21:39.535]  Because the Power Swabs 5 Minute Challenge is exclusive, it's not available in drugstores.

[02:24:41.572 --> 02:24:44.713]  And there's beer in Texarkana.
[02:24:45.193 --> 02:24:48.854]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:48.914 --> 02:24:49.674]  Thank you so much.
[02:24:50.354 --> 02:24:51.694]  All right, let me play a few more.
[02:24:51.714 --> 02:24:58.116]  There's literally dozens of these in the last few days that are on the nightly news here at 7 o'clock central.
[02:24:58.176 --> 02:25:08.158]  And then Colonel Schaefer, with the inside intel, and I trust whatever he says has proven accurate over the years so many times, from 9-11 to Benghazi, he's going to be joining us.
[02:25:09.478 --> 02:25:12.479]  It takes some work to get him on, because they tell him not to come on.
[02:25:13.500 --> 02:25:14.400]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:25:14.420 --> 02:25:15.861]  He gets chewed out pretty good.
[02:25:16.201 --> 02:25:18.582]  But he cares about getting the truth out, so we appreciate him coming on.
[02:25:19.462 --> 02:25:23.844]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip from David Knight.
[02:25:24.164 --> 02:25:26.785]  This has been going on a while, but now it's openly going on.
[02:25:27.385 --> 02:25:36.209]  Turning the fire department into Homeland Security federalized snitches to spy on government, not just people's houses when they're in them.
[02:25:36.849 --> 02:25:41.611]  And I can think of no government agency better than the fire department on average.
[02:25:41.751 --> 02:25:47.973]  Better people, more patriotic, just the firefighters I know, just, I don't know, for whatever reason, are always the best people in the world.
[02:25:48.453 --> 02:25:49.533]  I just love firefighters.
[02:25:50.054 --> 02:25:51.634]  I just, my experiences personally.
[02:25:52.034 --> 02:25:53.555]  True public servants.
[02:25:54.654 --> 02:25:57.356]  Now they're being turned into feds, who aren't even feds.
[02:25:57.396 --> 02:25:58.556]  The globalists run the feds.
[02:25:58.877 --> 02:26:01.458]  This is so horrible, it's like The Thing.
[02:26:01.778 --> 02:26:05.741]  You know, our precious firefighters are being turned into these globalist creatures.
[02:26:06.081 --> 02:26:07.281]  Here is David Knight's report.
[02:26:07.982 --> 02:26:17.948]  InfoWars has received a curious job posting showing that the Houston Fire Department has a classified position with Homeland Security or police background preferred.
[02:26:18.328 --> 02:26:23.631]  Remember, this is a fire department looking for Homeland Security or police background.
[02:26:23.991 --> 02:26:30.598]  The position will require analytic ability and inductive thinking to address unusual or complex situations.
[02:26:31.039 --> 02:26:41.230]  And this secret policeman inside the fire department will require diplomacy to persuade prominent persons like community leaders, business leaders, and government officials.
[02:26:41.897 --> 02:26:52.044]  Earlier this summer, the Pentagon killed a 60-year program supplying surplus military equipment to rural and small-town fire departments, setting off a firestorm of controversy.
[02:26:52.325 --> 02:27:01.952]  The program was eventually restored, but at the same time they killed surplus equipment for fighting fires, they were lavishing equipment on police departments to fight citizens.
[02:27:02.392 --> 02:27:12.856]  But now the Feds are currying favor with fire departments, giving them equipment, like rugged laptops, and making sure the firemen know who their sugar daddy is, Homeland Security.
[02:27:13.536 --> 02:27:21.239]  And they've created a classified position to influence, persuade, perhaps say something if they see something in the fire department or in the community.
[02:27:21.579 --> 02:27:25.481]  After all, who would think that a fireman would be a spy for DHS?
[02:27:26.061 --> 02:27:30.483]  But in Stasi America, Fed spies and propagandists are everywhere.
[02:27:31.343 --> 02:27:32.364]  Homeland Security.
[02:27:32.845 --> 02:27:36.448]  Deconstructing America through bribery, influence, and spying since 2002.
[02:27:36.689 --> 02:27:38.791]  That's it.
[02:27:38.851 --> 02:27:41.153]  It's a foreign, outside, globalist takeover.
[02:27:41.514 --> 02:27:43.175]  It is meant to be the coup d'etat.
[02:27:43.496 --> 02:27:45.157]  Vici French style against America.
[02:27:45.418 --> 02:27:48.281]  Here's Jakari Jackson's report on the spider dog.
[02:27:56.334 --> 02:27:57.255]  No, that's not real.
[02:27:57.315 --> 02:27:59.337]  It's a dog in a costume, but this is.
[02:27:59.557 --> 02:28:02.199]  Obviously, that was a dog wearing a costume.
[02:28:02.520 --> 02:28:05.122]  But there are real examples of genetic splicing.
[02:28:05.482 --> 02:28:11.968]  And while there may not be any actual spider dogs, at least none that I'm aware of, there are, in fact, spider goats.
[02:28:12.069 --> 02:28:18.935]  So these kids have the genes for a spider in them?
[02:28:19.475 --> 02:28:20.116]  Yes.
[02:28:20.236 --> 02:28:20.937]  It's insane!
[02:28:22.094 --> 02:28:25.536]  And where does the spider silk actually come from?
[02:28:25.576 --> 02:28:26.536]  I mean, where did he get it?
[02:28:26.796 --> 02:28:28.577]  Well, it was designed so it comes in the milk.
[02:28:29.358 --> 02:28:34.620]  They look like such normal goats, but in fact, they're totally unique and bizarre.
[02:28:34.680 --> 02:28:35.321]  I mean, this is bizarre.
[02:28:35.341 --> 02:28:36.321]  That's in New York, by the way.
[02:28:36.581 --> 02:28:38.282]  I guess I would not say it's bizarre.
[02:28:38.502 --> 02:28:43.465]  The goats milk out a super strong silk that can be used for body armor, as well as other things.
[02:28:43.985 --> 02:28:47.389]  And if that wasn't enough, how about a glow-in-the-dark pet?
[02:28:47.869 --> 02:28:53.275]  Jellyfish genes have been injected into cats and other animals to give them their distinctive look.
[02:28:54.015 --> 02:28:59.081]  And to round things out, trout have been genetically modified to have six-pack abs.
[02:28:59.581 --> 02:29:03.766]  Scientists achieved this by switching off a gene that normally stunts muscle growth.
[02:29:04.326 --> 02:29:12.415]  So whether it's a bodybuilder fish or some other type of scientific anomaly, I don't want anything that man's been playing God with to end up on my dinner plate.
[02:29:12.855 --> 02:29:16.019]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[02:29:16.880 --> 02:29:18.160]  That's Jakari Jackson.
[02:29:18.521 --> 02:29:20.761]  We call him Mr. Viral Video around here.
[02:29:21.201 --> 02:29:21.962]  Kicking butt.
[02:29:22.242 --> 02:29:28.183]  See, we take some mindless thing that doesn't matter and then educate people about GMO, genetic engineering that's going on.
[02:29:28.484 --> 02:29:30.204]  And by the way, they can make a cat glow in the dark.
[02:29:30.224 --> 02:29:31.184]  You can buy them right now.
[02:29:31.645 --> 02:29:32.145]  You can buy them.
[02:29:32.425 --> 02:29:33.745]  Here in the U.S., they're from China.
[02:29:34.625 --> 02:29:39.047]  But then it switches on a bunch of other genes and causes all sorts of problems.
[02:29:39.327 --> 02:29:39.507]  I mean,
[02:29:40.785 --> 02:29:42.086]  Humans are going to destroy ourselves.
[02:29:42.166 --> 02:29:43.546]  I'm telling you, this is getting crazy.
[02:29:44.127 --> 02:29:45.467]  Look at how Ebola's mutated.
[02:29:45.487 --> 02:29:54.052]  We're going to talk to Lieutenant Colonel Schaeffer straight ahead to get his inside take on ISIS and the President's speech coming up tonight.
[02:29:54.452 --> 02:29:56.673]  We'll look back at Benghazi and more straight ahead.
[02:29:59.174 --> 02:30:00.095]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.575 --> 02:30:02.176]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.096 --> 02:30:05.778]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:11.070 --> 02:30:12.170]  Open your eyes.
[02:30:12.591 --> 02:30:15.532]  It's time to give your eyes a powerful nutritional boost.
[02:30:16.012 --> 02:30:22.174]  Sight is the primary input to the brain, arguably making eyesight the most important sense we have.
[02:30:22.494 --> 02:30:30.437]  And just like the other important organs in our bodies, our eyes function at peak levels when they are fed the proper amounts of essential nutrition.

[02:31:10.330 --> 02:31:18.816]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being, and you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[02:31:19.016 --> 02:31:25.220]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[02:31:25.640 --> 02:31:29.285]  Now, our extra strength new nascent iodine formula is here.
[02:31:29.525 --> 02:31:30.887]  Survival Shield X2.

[02:32:11.318 --> 02:32:12.359]  In the near future.
[02:32:12.659 --> 02:32:16.280]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:32:16.300 --> 02:32:16.781]  Security alert.
[02:32:17.141 --> 02:32:18.161]  Security alert.
[02:32:18.381 --> 02:32:20.102]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:32:20.382 --> 02:32:21.002]  Analysis.
[02:32:21.263 --> 02:32:21.923]  InfoWars.
[02:32:21.983 --> 02:32:23.904]  Building independent media operations.
[02:32:23.924 --> 02:32:28.946]  You've got the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:32:28.966 --> 02:32:29.906]  Prime Directive.
[02:32:29.987 --> 02:32:31.367]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[02:32:31.547 --> 02:32:34.328]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:32:34.388 --> 02:32:37.450]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:32:37.650 --> 02:32:39.811]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:32:39.991 --> 02:32:41.432]  These people are assaulting us.
[02:32:41.452 --> 02:32:43.793]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:32:44.293 --> 02:32:45.954]  They are never going to stop.
[02:32:46.235 --> 02:32:50.137]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[02:32:50.277 --> 02:32:53.479]  Block free iPhone apps at InfoWars.com.
[02:32:53.879 --> 02:32:56.520]  Block free podcasts and video feeds.
[02:32:57.221 --> 02:32:57.961]  Imperative.
[02:32:58.221 --> 02:33:00.243]  Destroy Prisoner's Limit TV.
[02:33:00.263 --> 02:33:04.645]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:33:04.945 --> 02:33:06.286]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[02:33:06.306 --> 02:33:07.067]  You can feel it.
[02:33:20.402 --> 02:33:22.483]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:22.984 --> 02:33:26.125]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:32.249 --> 02:33:38.212]  By the way, I don't usually think when lines keep dropping that it's a conspiracy, but when somebody like Lt.
[02:33:38.232 --> 02:33:38.492]  Col.
[02:33:38.512 --> 02:33:40.593]  Tony Schaffer's coming on, this stuff starts happening.
[02:33:40.613 --> 02:33:43.875]  Because believe me, they don't like him coming on this show.
[02:33:43.895 --> 02:33:45.536]  Talking about Benghazi, any of it.
[02:33:46.236 --> 02:33:49.798]  I mean, our guests get subpoenaed by the Justice Department, you name it, on Benghazi.
[02:33:49.818 --> 02:33:51.620]  I mean, they are listening right now.
[02:33:52.220 --> 02:33:53.921]  So, he may not even be able to be on today.
[02:33:54.081 --> 02:33:54.381]  We'll see.
[02:33:54.461 --> 02:33:55.982]  We keep trying, it's busy.
[02:33:56.282 --> 02:33:57.543]  He gets on, it disconnects.
[02:33:58.184 --> 02:34:04.548]  So, we'll see what happens with Lieutenant Colonel Tony Schaefer here today on the broadcast.
[02:34:05.488 --> 02:34:18.861]  Speaking of what's happening right now with President Obama set to speak tonight announcing reportedly expanded military operations against ISIS that's been openly armed by NATO and others and with Benghazi weapons.
[02:34:19.242 --> 02:34:22.205]  That has now been admitted to him by top generals on Fox News.
[02:34:23.567 --> 02:34:26.769]  Obama is set to ignore Congress and announce the Syria strikes tonight.
[02:34:26.849 --> 02:34:29.850]  Congress isn't trying to consult with him so they can be part of the decision.
[02:34:30.410 --> 02:34:33.932]  And I'll tell you, I won't cry myself to sleep at night if ISIS gets bombed.
[02:34:34.432 --> 02:34:39.035]  The question is, Congress is supposed to be in charge of this, then the President executes.
[02:34:39.575 --> 02:34:41.156]  He is not consulting Congress.
[02:34:41.676 --> 02:34:43.017]  This article out September 10th.
[02:34:44.175 --> 02:35:02.042]  President Barack Obama is set to ignore Congress once again by launching military strikes inside Syria without consulting lawmakers, a move that threatens to inflame the entire region given that Assad government has repeatedly insisted it will consider any military activity inside Syrian territory as an act of war.
[02:35:03.843 --> 02:35:06.264]  Yeah, I mean this will set the precedent for U.S.
[02:35:06.304 --> 02:35:11.946]  aircraft to be bombing inside Syria who our government a year ago was trying to overthrow
[02:35:14.412 --> 02:35:26.918]  So that the coalition of radicals, 60 plus percent being Al-Qaeda affiliated, that's even the Pentagon's admission, could take the country over and blow up every church they found.
[02:35:27.819 --> 02:35:29.339]  It just doesn't hold water.
[02:35:29.379 --> 02:35:30.000]  It's bizarre.
[02:35:31.141 --> 02:35:42.670]  And it isn't bomb ISIS in Iraq, more than a few bombings a day that looks like it's just for show, like Clinton blowing up the Nigerian aspirin factory when he got caught lying about Monica Lewinsky.
[02:35:43.090 --> 02:35:46.473]  It really reeks of Wag the Dog type stuff, what's happening in Iraq.
[02:35:46.793 --> 02:35:49.095]  This'll probably be on top of the presidential headquarters.
[02:35:49.595 --> 02:35:51.216]  They'll claim Al-Qaeda's in there or something.
[02:35:52.737 --> 02:35:53.418]  Really amazing.
[02:35:53.458 --> 02:35:55.039]  I wanted to get Tony Schafer's take on it.
[02:35:55.059 --> 02:35:55.880]  We'll see if that happens.
[02:35:56.874 --> 02:35:59.455]  President Obama is prepared to use U.S.
[02:35:59.495 --> 02:36:14.000]  military airstrikes in Syria as part of an expanded campaign to defeat the Islamic State, and does not believe he needs former congressional approval to take that action, according to people who have spoken with the President in recent days.
[02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:18.301]  And you've got different Republican leaders coming out and saying they agree with that.
[02:36:20.620 --> 02:36:25.262]  Obama is set to deliver a primetime speech tonight, during which he will make the case for U.S.
[02:36:25.322 --> 02:36:28.484]  airstrikes inside Syria in the name of targeting ISIS militants.
[02:36:29.044 --> 02:36:31.045]  Is he gonna bomb them on 9-11?
[02:36:33.246 --> 02:36:36.508]  Is this all wag the dog from Benghazi revelations that are coming out?
[02:36:38.229 --> 02:36:42.211]  I think undoubtedly it is wag the dog, but wag the dog away from what?
[02:36:43.928 --> 02:36:47.731]  What are they trying to distract and divert away from right now?
[02:36:48.071 --> 02:37:00.679]  And will there be this fabled terror attack that we are being told is coming inside of the United States on or before 9-11?
[02:37:03.962 --> 02:37:09.886]  I know this, there better not be any terror attacks because this government is going to be held responsible, at least by the public I think,
[02:37:10.950 --> 02:37:14.733]  Now again, a lot of things have been happening over in the Middle East.
[02:37:14.753 --> 02:37:16.754]  It's a fluid and complex situation.
[02:37:40.984 --> 02:37:41.784]  But I know this.
[02:37:42.184 --> 02:37:51.647]  Al-Qaeda was supposedly defeated, pretty much, a few years ago, and now we're told the son of Al-Qaeda, IS or ISIS, is taking over the whole planet.
[02:37:52.387 --> 02:37:53.307]  They're going into Africa.
[02:37:53.327 --> 02:37:54.068]  They're going to the Middle East.
[02:37:54.088 --> 02:37:55.408]  They're going into India.
[02:37:55.428 --> 02:37:58.069]  They're showing up in the Far East.
[02:37:58.849 --> 02:38:00.189]  They're supposedly in Mexico.
[02:38:00.329 --> 02:38:01.110]  Is that true?
[02:38:01.130 --> 02:38:09.112]  And what is NATO's real policy when they help fund this very group to attack Syria
[02:38:10.129 --> 02:38:11.631]  in the last two years.
[02:38:13.094 --> 02:38:17.861]  I know that he's been critical of what's been happening in Syria, backing these rebels.
[02:38:18.382 --> 02:38:20.965]  We have Lieutenant Colonel Tony Schaefer on, who
[02:38:24.093 --> 02:38:25.314]  is also a best-selling author.
[02:38:25.354 --> 02:38:28.998]  He's the guy that testified in Congress about Stratus IV.
[02:38:29.518 --> 02:38:32.681]  The last line is his latest book.
[02:38:32.721 --> 02:38:39.048]  He's written nonfiction, but the last line is fiction, so I guess he can get more stuff in there and not have it...
[02:38:40.709 --> 02:38:43.010]  Censored, and it just went into paperback.
[02:38:43.070 --> 02:38:47.652]  Again, it is a New York Times bestseller and has four and a half stars on Amazon.
[02:38:48.073 --> 02:38:48.853]  And I've read the book.
[02:38:48.893 --> 02:38:49.393]  It's excellent.
[02:38:49.413 --> 02:38:50.314]  Just throwing that out there.
[02:38:50.634 --> 02:38:53.235]  Colonel Schaefer, thank you so much for coming on with us today.
[02:38:53.515 --> 02:38:55.076]  We've obviously got a lot of questions for you.
[02:38:55.476 --> 02:38:56.036]  Sure, Alex.
[02:38:56.056 --> 02:38:56.517]  Great to be on.
[02:38:56.557 --> 02:38:57.137]  Thank you for having me.
[02:38:58.137 --> 02:38:58.958]  Where should we start?
[02:38:58.998 --> 02:39:03.160]  The President's coming up tonight claiming he's going to strike ISIS inside Syria.
[02:39:04.096 --> 02:39:06.080]  What happens if Syria gets upset about that?
[02:39:06.380 --> 02:39:08.224]  They said they'll consider it an act of war.
[02:39:08.244 --> 02:39:11.330]  I thought we were backing these very rebels in Syria.
[02:39:11.350 --> 02:39:11.831]  What's happening?
[02:39:12.632 --> 02:39:13.133]  Well, we were!
[02:39:13.193 --> 02:39:14.994]  I mean, that's the grand irony here.
[02:39:15.054 --> 02:39:24.783]  And one of the things I'm hearing, Alex, is going to be, I think, troubling to your audience and to you and me both, is the fact that he's going to ask for, like, $500 million to fund these so-called militia.
[02:39:25.343 --> 02:39:29.527]  And so I'm calling it the Guarantee of Adversary Act of 2014.
[02:39:29.847 --> 02:39:35.392]  So we will guarantee to have enemies trying to kill us for the next 10 years based on the fact we'll be funded.
[02:39:35.412 --> 02:39:37.374]  That's how insane this legislation is.
[02:39:37.854 --> 02:39:40.776]  Because if you like what happened in Libya, that's what he's trying to do.
[02:39:41.256 --> 02:39:45.058]  And so I have no confidence at all in what he's going to talk about tonight.
[02:39:45.098 --> 02:39:56.984]  As a matter of fact, I literally just left Capitol Hill, where we've been meeting with members and staff and had a conference on an alternate strategy we're trying to put forth that we will actually, we're going to make it public.
[02:39:57.004 --> 02:40:00.826]  We're not going to hide our intention to try to get some sunlight shined on this.
[02:40:01.307 --> 02:40:05.289]  But to your point in the opening, Alex, the very people
[02:40:05.911 --> 02:40:29.789]  That they're now, the President's going to talk about trying to kill and roll back, are the ones that had he gone about conducting the airstrikes, destabilizing the Assad regime last summer, had we done that, they would now be in charge of all of Syria, and they would have had not only the army they've stolen from Iraq, they would have had pretty much the whole Syrian army, which is not an unformidable force.
[02:40:31.357 --> 02:40:43.246]  Well, we're even hearing from the family members of one of the journalists who reportedly had his head sawed off by these crazies that it's the so-called good rebels in Syria that sold him to ISIS.
[02:40:43.326 --> 02:40:52.873]  And I've seen Pentagon numbers of 65% of the jihadis there in Syria are al-Qaeda or ISIS linked.
[02:40:53.153 --> 02:40:54.234]  What's the numbers you've got?
[02:40:55.154 --> 02:41:00.457]  The numbers are higher than that, and I don't want to get into it because I've been told exactly what they think they are, and I have to stay away from that.
[02:41:00.477 --> 02:41:02.038]  But let me just tell you, they're higher.
[02:41:02.718 --> 02:41:15.965]  And this is the concern that you and your audience, I think, really need to internalize here, is that funding these guys, fundamentally, may well help destabilize Assad, but when they're done with Assad, they're coming back towards us.
[02:41:16.885 --> 02:41:19.907]  There is no good to be had from funding these militia.
[02:41:20.227 --> 02:41:31.312]  And as you point out, Alex, rightfully, that these so-called allies, these guys that we were working with, sold the journalists, one of the American journalists, into ISIS for purposes of their own making.
[02:41:31.613 --> 02:41:38.136]  So there are, let me be painfully clear here, there are no good radical Muslim militia.
[02:41:38.716 --> 02:41:42.158]  Anytime we fund something like that, it will come back to bite us.
[02:41:43.199 --> 02:41:52.225]  One of the policy points we just made to members in Congress here, Alex, is the fact we have invested in a workable military organization in the Middle East.
[02:41:52.545 --> 02:41:56.108]  These consist of militaries that we have helped shape.
[02:41:56.368 --> 02:41:58.890]  The Egyptian military, the Jordanian military.
[02:41:59.270 --> 02:42:01.191]  These are all militaries which we've invested in.
[02:42:01.551 --> 02:42:13.375]  They have stead offices to the military academies, to the war colleges, and for goodness sake, why would we not want to work with them, such as the Egyptians, who right now, by the way, Alex, are doing what we should have done in Libya.
[02:42:14.235 --> 02:42:26.939]  The Egyptian military is now trying to retake the cities we allowed al-Qaeda to take in Libya, and they're engaging against these very sort of militia in the Sinai Peninsula, trying to help the Israelis out.
[02:42:27.279 --> 02:42:33.944]  So, again, you know, we tend to actually do damage to the very allies we have, such as the Egyptians.
[02:42:34.344 --> 02:42:42.329]  And yet we defund these guys, and what we see here are, again, the tragic results of journals being beheaded.
[02:42:42.930 --> 02:42:49.134]  And I was in a meeting with the Assyrians who have been displaced by ISIS.
[02:42:49.194 --> 02:42:51.115]  I was in a meeting with the Christians yesterday.
[02:42:51.215 --> 02:42:53.597]  And Alex, let me be clear here.
[02:42:53.897 --> 02:42:54.837]  They don't want to come here.
[02:42:54.857 --> 02:42:57.019]  They just want to have help regaining
[02:42:57.419 --> 02:43:04.165]  They're 5,000-year-old cities who they've lived there in peace for thousands of years.
[02:43:04.425 --> 02:43:05.166]  They want them back.
[02:43:05.466 --> 02:43:06.367]  They don't want to come here.
[02:43:06.587 --> 02:43:10.271]  And yet somehow we have allowed for this ISIS to destabilize the region.
[02:43:10.571 --> 02:43:14.655]  And again, it's not like they're going to just take Assad out.
[02:43:14.895 --> 02:43:18.398]  They're going to try to establish their own state, and they're going to come here to kill us next.
[02:43:19.870 --> 02:43:35.575]  All these years supposedly to take out Al Qaeda, being backed by Saudi Arabia and others, and now they've got hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions, and we're told, oh, just give more money to the non-radical group that's the minority, and as you said, are radical as well.
[02:43:36.595 --> 02:43:44.758]  This sounds like more covert funding of ISIS and maybe a payoff to get them to stop attacking Iraq and to go back after Assad.
[02:43:45.078 --> 02:44:02.224]  I mean there's got to be some real policy here or is some covert policy or is this really total ineptitude because I remember you here years ago when Benghazi took place on 9-11 saying it was an arms deal to get weapons to Al-Qaeda.
[02:44:02.504 --> 02:44:03.944]  We just call them ISIS now.
[02:44:04.164 --> 02:44:05.545]  So give us the inside scoop.
[02:44:06.857 --> 02:44:17.484]  The policy is one that's been heavily influenced by, I believe, what is the issue we have been dealing with the past 12 years, Alex, which is something called the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:44:18.505 --> 02:44:26.070]  And as much as I think a lot of folks have been made to think that they are a moderate organization, they are not.
[02:44:26.690 --> 02:44:30.693]  And since last we talked, I met with General Al-Tuheimi.
[02:44:30.893 --> 02:44:32.414]  General Al-Tuheimi is the Chief
[02:44:33.132 --> 02:44:33.973]  We're good to go.
[02:44:51.451 --> 02:44:58.492]  The Brotherhood have been the reason that while we have met Al-Qaeda and defeated them in every tactical engagement for the past 12 years.
[02:44:58.552 --> 02:45:00.613]  Anytime we have to fight them, we win.
[02:45:00.953 --> 02:45:07.594]  The reason that Al-Qaeda has not been defeated is because you have the Brotherhood, who is essentially the feeding organization.
[02:45:07.614 --> 02:45:14.655]  They're the ones who are behind the scenes helping fund Al-Qaeda, all along pretending to be a quote-unquote moderate organization.
[02:45:15.115 --> 02:45:18.616]  An organization, by the way, that is closely aligned to an organization called CARE.
[02:45:19.286 --> 02:45:20.467]  Well, right here in the United States.
[02:45:21.308 --> 02:45:27.955]  The Holy Land Foundation, members of the Holy Land Foundation were convicted because of their link to the Brotherhood.
[02:45:29.176 --> 02:45:33.581]  The same Holy Land Foundation had members of CARE who were unindicted co-conspirators.
[02:45:33.941 --> 02:45:35.683]  So right there is all you need to know.
[02:45:35.703 --> 02:45:36.764]  Let me expand on that.
[02:45:38.045 --> 02:45:39.206]  Yeah.
[02:45:39.346 --> 02:45:45.649]  The monster growing the Al-Qaeda and ISIS heads is the Muslim Brotherhood, Saudi Arabia, and others.
[02:45:46.009 --> 02:45:48.890]  And so every time you cut a head off, five more grow back.
[02:45:49.111 --> 02:45:49.391]  Correct.
[02:45:49.551 --> 02:45:56.574]  And then now, why would President Obama and NATO, because I know there's an internal fight going on and it really made the military mad here in the U.S.
[02:45:56.814 --> 02:45:59.796]  That's why we got so much intel on what really happened from you and others.
[02:46:01.072 --> 02:46:08.217]  Bottom line, how did they think they'd get away with giving 15,000 MPADs to Al Qaeda and other jihadis?
[02:46:08.537 --> 02:46:23.246]  How do they think when they're running around, Reuters is now reporting, and so is the Washington Post, that yes, they have US M16s, yes, they have US anti-tank weapons, yes, they have US anti-aircraft weapons, and they're trying to claim, oh, they got them from the other Syrian rebels.
[02:46:23.586 --> 02:46:23.846]  How?
[02:46:25.188 --> 02:46:26.750]  Who is guilty for this in Washington?
[02:46:26.990 --> 02:46:31.236]  I know that's a dangerous thing to talk about, but I know that's what you are discussing behind closed doors.
[02:46:31.657 --> 02:46:32.158]  Who's to blame?
[02:46:32.731 --> 02:46:34.833]  Well, the administration, this is bad policy.
[02:46:35.073 --> 02:46:46.162]  This is a combination of... The National Security Council, under Susan Rice and Alex, is the equivalent of eight-year-olds running around in Brooks Brothers outfits.
[02:46:46.722 --> 02:46:47.803]  Seriously.
[02:46:47.863 --> 02:46:48.664]  They have no clue.
[02:46:49.004 --> 02:46:56.971]  And then you have a radical ideology that, gee, maybe the United States ought to be taken down a few notches, and maybe if we just treat people better, they'll understand us.
[02:46:57.031 --> 02:47:01.234]  Maybe if we talk to them nicer and show that we understand, they'll be nicer to us.
[02:47:02.615 --> 02:47:04.316]  That is the thinking here, believe it or not.
[02:47:04.817 --> 02:47:08.679]  And what that translates into is hugely bad policy.
[02:47:09.300 --> 02:47:14.883]  I mean, you cannot believe, Alex, some of the nonsense I hear that comes out of the National Security Council.
[02:47:14.903 --> 02:47:19.426]  Well, when I see Susan Rice speak, I'm no military person, but I study military news every day.
[02:47:19.767 --> 02:47:21.027]  They talk like buffoons.
[02:47:21.328 --> 02:47:23.769]  A private in the Army would know more than these women do.
[02:47:24.029 --> 02:47:25.791]  I mean, and they're in charge of all this.
[02:47:28.604 --> 02:47:35.450]  Yeah, so that's what we're dealing with, Alex, is that we don't have any adults in the room actually doing anything.
[02:47:36.130 --> 02:47:53.144]  And as much as I'd like to believe that they're going to figure out a policy going forward, I have no confidence tonight that this policy that President Obama is going to announce will actually do anything to deal with the Islamic State, or ISIS, whatever you want to call it, in any substantial way, because, Alex,
[02:47:53.744 --> 02:47:58.307]  Fundamentally, they've been supporting the very underpinnings of the whole network.
[02:47:58.567 --> 02:48:05.571]  It's not simply about ISIS, it's about Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, it's about Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, it's about Al-Sharia.
[02:48:05.931 --> 02:48:12.275]  It's a network, Alex, that sprung up from the fact that we never got to the root cause of this, which is the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:48:14.893 --> 02:48:27.696]  I just don't see how a president is going to get up on television and claim he's going to run some airstrikes against ISIS and then arm the other Syrian rebels who've been fighting side-by-side with them to then displace ISIS.
[02:48:28.276 --> 02:48:31.716]  I mean, from the perspective of Assad, he can't trust what Obama's saying.
[02:48:32.057 --> 02:48:36.677]  What happens if Assad starts shooting surface-to-air missiles at the U.S.
[02:48:36.737 --> 02:48:38.478]  aircraft that go in there for these strikes?
[02:48:39.879 --> 02:48:52.469]  That's going to be an interesting dilemma because backing up Assad is both Hezbollah, which is the other terrorist organization run by Iran, and our friend Vladimir Putin.
[02:48:52.969 --> 02:49:01.737]  And Alex, I don't know how closely you follow my Facebook postings, I know we're friends on there, but one of the things I've predicted is that if we don't act,
[02:49:02.217 --> 02:49:14.570]  You will see essentially a form of the Warsaw Pact establish itself in the Middle East, and you will see SU-25s, which is the equivalent of the A-10s, rolling in on combat missions in this area to defeat ISIS.
[02:49:14.610 --> 02:49:21.557]  So if we don't do it, you will see, once Putin is done with the Ukraine, and I don't want to get into that right now, but that's a whole other bag of worms.
[02:49:21.597 --> 02:49:22.558]  He's distracted right now.
[02:49:22.598 --> 02:49:23.579]  Putin is with Ukraine.
[02:49:24.039 --> 02:49:24.680]  Once that's done,
[02:49:25.460 --> 02:49:35.327]  I would predict that you'll see Putin actually using military force via Iran to back up Hezbollah and back up his ally Assad if we choose not to do anything against ISIS.
[02:49:35.347 --> 02:49:43.813]  Well could you blame, and I'm not again saying Russia's an angel, could you blame Russia because Al-Qaeda and ISIS is saying they're going to attack Russia next?
[02:49:44.226 --> 02:49:44.506]  No, no, no.
[02:49:44.686 --> 02:50:04.771]  And people who understand the 80s will reflect on the fact that while we were getting our behinds kicked in Beirut, the Russians once had some of their folks kidnapped by Hezbollah, and the Russians basically went back in and killed everybody and killed their families and said, you never touch us again or else we won't do the same tactics to you you do to us.
[02:50:05.092 --> 02:50:06.492]  And that stopped the Russian
[02:50:07.032 --> 02:50:07.773]  We're good to go.
[02:50:26.563 --> 02:50:32.806]  And I've argued, and I met with, again, Yazidi Christians today who were talking about their plight.
[02:50:32.866 --> 02:50:41.950]  It's like, you know, they all believe that as much as ISIS is bad, you know, the better of two evils is Assad, because Assad wasn't out beheading people.
[02:50:42.410 --> 02:50:52.274]  And I think as much as it may pain the President to have to go back against his policy, we need to work with Assad on this, because otherwise we will see ISIS formulate its own nation.
[02:50:52.774 --> 02:50:53.155]  We're good.
[02:51:02.017 --> 02:51:23.086]  I know you're not supposed to say, but from my sources, and I know you've got a lot higher level than I do, you're up there at the Capitol, that they have substantive groups here in the US, and that this could be a way to basically blackmail Obama, because Obama now knows if there's terror attacks, and Susan Rice and others helped create this current group, that they're going to get the blame for it.
[02:51:23.446 --> 02:51:25.087]  Couldn't we have
[02:51:26.127 --> 02:51:27.968]  High-level blackmail already going on?
[02:51:28.088 --> 02:51:36.772]  Oh, I'm seeing, Alex, the same basic patterns I saw right before 9-11 regarding our work, and you mentioned stratus IV-enabled danger.
[02:51:36.792 --> 02:51:46.377]  I am seeing the same neglect, the same wishful thinking at the policy level, where, ah, you know, yeah, they may have to tell us here, but they won't really do anything to hurt us.
[02:51:46.457 --> 02:51:47.638]  That is what I'm hearing.
[02:51:48.138 --> 02:52:09.348]  And I think you have to believe, I don't know this for a fact, but you have to believe that there may be something like that going on because what president, what policy-making body would ever allow known adversaries to act, to walk freely within our border simply because they think that, well, if we, you know, we'll leave, you know, they leave us alone, we'll leave them alone.
[02:52:09.728 --> 02:52:12.590]  That's what, that was the naive thinking that resulted in the 9-11 attacks.
[02:52:13.710 --> 02:52:29.246]  And I'm telling you right now, it may not happen this 9-11, it may not happen the next 9-11, but we are literally allowing the conditions to be created which are going to allow the next 9-11, which I would predict is going to be far more severe, far more catastrophic than the 9-11 attacks could have ever been.
[02:52:29.861 --> 02:52:40.645]  Lieutenant Colonel Tony Schaefer is our guest, folks, and you can go to LondonCenter.org, one of the think tank policy groups he's involved with.
[02:52:41.185 --> 02:52:43.005]  His site's down today, there's a lot of traffic.
[02:52:43.325 --> 02:52:45.586]  It'll be back up soon, OperationDarkHeart.com.
[02:52:45.826 --> 02:52:47.647]  And you've got a bunch of big Facebooks.
[02:52:47.887 --> 02:52:50.628]  What's the main Facebook for people to visit?
[02:52:51.203 --> 02:52:57.027]  Well, right now, I think, you know, you and I talked about this last time when it first came out, and you mentioned it in the opening, the last line.
[02:52:57.567 --> 02:53:06.033]  And you were correct, sir, in that I can talk a lot more about stuff that actually goes on through fiction than I can through the non-fiction, which you may be interested in.
[02:53:06.053 --> 02:53:14.339]  You know, Mark Zaid, my lawyer, and I are still fighting a First Amendment lawsuit against the government about the overarching redactions of information which was unclassified in the first book.
[02:53:14.399 --> 02:53:17.561]  But with that said, I would like people to kind of focus on the last line because
[02:53:18.101 --> 02:53:18.782]  I think it's
[02:53:37.285 --> 02:53:39.588]  Kids coming across are a tug at our heart, Alex.
[02:53:40.008 --> 02:53:41.430]  The issue is not the kids.
[02:53:41.510 --> 02:53:48.057]  It's about the fact that other nefarious folks, drug cartels, terrorist groups, are going to use the Southwest border to get their people in here.
[02:53:48.338 --> 02:53:48.518]  Sure.
[02:53:48.618 --> 02:53:49.839]  I mean, when does your novel come out?
[02:53:49.879 --> 02:53:51.421]  It's now gone, like, six, eight months ago?
[02:53:52.322 --> 02:53:55.886]  It came out a year ago in hardcover, but now it's out in paperback.
[02:53:55.926 --> 02:54:04.415]  Sure, but the point I'm getting at is, when I read the hardcover that came here, well, time flies, a year ago before you came on, it was excellent, and I talked to you on air, I said, this is real, isn't it?
[02:54:04.635 --> 02:54:09.340]  You said, well, I can't say that or they'll stop me, but they won't let me publish the real book, but yeah, this is it.
[02:54:09.741 --> 02:54:11.703]  Since then, what about the optics?
[02:54:12.023 --> 02:54:17.304]  Of literally opening the southern border wide open, busing anybody across that wants to come across.
[02:54:17.664 --> 02:54:27.727]  I've been critical of Rick Perry on a lot of issues, but they've indicted him for holding back money from a drunk, crazy person while he is covertly trying to secure the border.
[02:54:27.807 --> 02:54:29.887]  I have to commend him and the state police.
[02:54:30.267 --> 02:54:33.448]  He's actually trying to secure the border and he's been indicted.
[02:54:33.468 --> 02:54:38.469]  I mean, it's almost like the Democrats are secretly allied with Al Qaeda or something.
[02:54:38.865 --> 02:54:41.988]  Well, this goes back to our conversation about the Brotherhood.
[02:54:42.308 --> 02:54:43.549]  Let me be very clear on this.
[02:54:43.729 --> 02:54:47.592]  The Muslim Brotherhood has penetrated every aspect of our governance.
[02:54:47.872 --> 02:54:49.053]  Every aspect, Alex.
[02:54:49.434 --> 02:54:50.795]  They have influence in the media.
[02:54:51.055 --> 02:54:52.596]  They have influence on Capitol Hill.
[02:54:52.937 --> 02:55:02.885]  They have been able to go through and DOD, and basically, the reason we can't call Islamic radicalism Islamic radicalism is because they have done this Orwellian thing.
[02:55:03.425 --> 02:55:04.846]  And I have a friend of mine who told me this.
[02:55:05.427 --> 02:55:07.669]  The DOD was forced to remove all
[02:55:08.630 --> 02:55:16.038]  All references to radical Islam because of brotherhood influence over the FBI and DOD.
[02:55:16.079 --> 02:55:16.799]  This is not fiction.
[02:55:16.819 --> 02:55:17.540]  This is the way it is.
[02:55:17.580 --> 02:55:18.842]  Well, that brings me to this point.
[02:55:19.884 --> 02:55:22.246]  I'm sure you saw the Fort Hood document came out last year.
[02:55:22.286 --> 02:55:29.550]  Fox News even picked it up where they said, founding fathers wouldn't be welcome in today's army when George Washington founded the army.
[02:55:29.850 --> 02:55:34.533]  And then it went on, don't join evangelical groups of the Tea Party or you'll be disciplined.
[02:55:34.953 --> 02:55:38.315]  Since when can the army say what you can do in your private life if it's legal and lawful?
[02:55:38.716 --> 02:55:45.340]  So Homeland Security says their main mission now is gun owners, veterans, conservatives, libertarians, and that
[02:55:45.960 --> 02:55:48.343]  Radical Islam isn't even on the list.
[02:55:48.403 --> 02:56:00.736]  I mean, that is so crazy that they flipped Homeland Security completely on to the American people with the backdrop of the IRS now trying to shut down Breitbart and arresting Dinesh D'Souza.
[02:56:01.391 --> 02:56:02.692]  Right, you're correct.
[02:56:02.712 --> 02:56:05.173]  And again, this has been their work behind the scenes.
[02:56:05.213 --> 02:56:15.878]  This has been a long-term... Again, Alex, while we've been fighting Al-Qaeda in the battlefield and winning, these folks have been working behind the scenes to subvert all of the governance we hold dear.
[02:56:16.458 --> 02:56:20.640]  And again, I hope your audience understands I'm not being over-bumped on this.
[02:56:21.041 --> 02:56:22.121]  Their influence is real.
[02:56:22.521 --> 02:56:27.084]  And again, this is why General Altohini and now-President Al-Sisi
[02:56:29.746 --> 02:56:47.302]  I know you're not supposed to get into this because you can get in trouble because of the Commander-in-Chief, but those same people were interviewed by WorldNet daily and confirmed Obama's cousin Odinga, the Prime Minister down in Kenya, is making all this money and is reportedly sending hundreds of millions up there financing it and Obama is directly involved.
[02:56:48.260 --> 02:56:52.602]  Well, I don't know that for a fact, but let me tell you this little tidbit, Alex, that I think your audience needs to understand.
[02:56:53.703 --> 02:56:59.686]  Just a few days before I met with General Altohimi, General Altohimi, the Chief of Addition Intelligence, John Brennan was there.
[02:56:59.746 --> 02:57:01.326]  John Brennan, our Director of CIA.
[02:57:01.887 --> 02:57:08.710]  So, one of the things that General Altohimi brought up to me is that he had brought up to John Brennan their issue with the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:57:09.150 --> 02:57:14.293]  And Altohimi, the Chief of their Intelligence, asked John Brennan directly, why don't you help us
[02:57:15.013 --> 02:57:16.013]  Attack the Brotherhood!
[02:57:16.353 --> 02:57:19.114]  Why don't you outlaw the Brotherhood, just like we're about to do?
[02:57:19.174 --> 02:57:20.354]  And by the way, they haven't done it.
[02:57:20.975 --> 02:57:30.177]  And so, Al Tohane didn't really tell us what Brennan said, so I asked him, I said, with all due respect, General, what did John Brennan say to you when you said that, you know, the Brotherhood's an enemy?
[02:57:30.497 --> 02:57:31.617]  What was his reply?
[02:57:32.278 --> 02:57:37.459]  He stiffened up, Alex, in his chair, looked at me sternly and said, John Brennan laughed in my face.
[02:57:38.826 --> 02:57:39.527]  Now think about that.
[02:57:39.987 --> 02:57:46.272]  Our Director of CIA laughed at the Chief of Intelligence of Egypt because he was told that the Brotherhood is a threat.
[02:57:46.792 --> 02:57:56.780]  The Brotherhood was blowing up churches, crucifying people, attacking military bases, trying to blow up the Suez Canal last year that forced the military to go after them.
[02:57:56.980 --> 02:58:00.263]  When they got power, they had a reign of terror in Egypt.
[02:58:00.723 --> 02:58:01.864]  That's correct.
[02:58:02.425 --> 02:58:11.336]  But that tells you right there that John Brennan does not believe that the Brotherhood is a threat because he has been brainwashed by these so-called moderates who are really not.
[02:58:11.796 --> 02:58:13.218]  Colonel Schaeffer, we're out of time.
[02:58:13.278 --> 02:58:16.542]  I could do five minutes overdrive but you probably gotta go.
[02:58:16.722 --> 02:58:18.605]  Can you stay five more minutes after this one-minute break?
[02:58:19.305 --> 02:58:20.026]  Um, I can, yes.
[02:58:39.443 --> 02:58:45.725]  And again, Colonel Schaffer is really important, folks, because he ran the entire Black Ops operation against Al-Qaeda and was ordered to stand down.
[02:58:45.745 --> 02:58:47.146]  You have to understand, right before 9-11.
[02:58:47.206 --> 02:58:48.526]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:48.546 --> 02:58:49.807]  Stay with us in 60 seconds.
[02:58:50.227 --> 02:58:51.648]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:51.748 --> 02:58:55.589]  Oh, and by the way, his new book, you can find that on Amazon.
[02:58:55.649 --> 02:58:57.470]  LondonCenter.org is the website.
[02:58:59.901 --> 02:59:08.392]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being, and you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[02:59:08.572 --> 02:59:14.800]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[02:59:15.080 --> 02:59:18.843]  Now, our extra strength new nascent iodine formula is here.
[02:59:19.083 --> 02:59:20.164]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:59:20.744 --> 02:59:24.748]  Leading the way into the next generation of super high quality nascent iodine.
[02:59:24.908 --> 02:59:30.272]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200 plus million year old salt solutions.
[02:59:30.492 --> 02:59:33.193]  Found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[02:59:33.573 --> 02:59:41.555]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients, and completely vegan.
[02:59:41.675 --> 02:59:45.136]  We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 Iodine for radiation.
[02:59:45.336 --> 02:59:48.157]  Pure, clean, and sourced from deep within the Earth.
[02:59:48.497 --> 02:59:54.678]  X2 Nascent Iodine is available exclusively at Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or call 1-888-253-3139.
[03:00:00.689 --> 03:00:03.551]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[03:00:04.292 --> 03:00:07.494]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:15.649 --> 03:00:19.830]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Coverers.
[03:00:19.850 --> 03:00:27.712]  Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaefer, best-selling author, researcher, the guy that ran the anti-Al Qaeda bin Laden unit that was ordered to stand down, major whistleblower.
[03:00:28.112 --> 03:00:31.233]  He's on with us, still works for the Army War College and other intelligence groups.
[03:00:31.573 --> 03:00:36.554]  At the highest level, he's kind of graduated on from the Army now into other secret operations.
[03:00:36.954 --> 03:00:38.535]  And we've got four minutes left with him.
[03:00:38.915 --> 03:00:40.175]  I want to ask you two things.
[03:00:40.875 --> 03:00:42.157]  What more do we know about Benghazi?
[03:00:42.177 --> 03:00:45.641]  Because everything you said right after it happened here turned out to be accurate.
[03:00:46.062 --> 03:00:46.963]  It's now all admitted.
[03:00:47.584 --> 03:00:52.309]  And what do we know is in the 28 censored pages of the 9-11 report?
[03:00:52.630 --> 03:00:54.993]  People that have seen it said it would bring down the whole system.
[03:00:55.851 --> 03:00:56.312]  Well, two things.
[03:00:56.752 --> 03:01:01.839]  The big thing to focus on now, Alex, is who turned off the response that night of Benghazi.
[03:01:01.879 --> 03:01:11.813]  We know it was turned off, and just so you know how the military works, once a credible act of terror is reported, everybody, all commands start, quote, basically to use a Civil War term,
[03:01:12.193 --> 03:01:13.655]  There was an order to stand down.
[03:01:13.675 --> 03:01:14.295]  There is a cover up.
[03:01:14.315 --> 03:01:15.256]  What did the President know?
[03:01:15.276 --> 03:01:15.797]  When did he know it?
[03:01:28.700 --> 03:01:29.300]  That's what the focus is.
[03:01:29.720 --> 03:01:35.241]  As to the 28 pages, I've met with and talked to multiple members of Congress who read it.
[03:01:35.961 --> 03:01:37.802]  They are convinced the American people need to see it.
[03:01:38.102 --> 03:01:44.503]  It has to do with information which is not convenient to the White House, either White House, the Clinton White House or the Bush White House.
[03:01:44.943 --> 03:01:51.384]  And it has to do with an ally, but since it looked the other way, it allowed a lot of support for the terrorists who conducted the attack.
[03:01:52.304 --> 03:01:53.924]  And so that's what's in there.
[03:01:54.044 --> 03:01:57.185]  It's something that I think... Without getting you in trouble...
[03:01:59.686 --> 03:02:12.613]  But just to be clear, this is what I've been told, that there was a cover-up, that Saudi Arabia was involved, and basically that's why there was a stand-down, because they didn't want to embarrass the Saudis, and that's why six of the ten commissioners want it released, is that right?
[03:02:14.334 --> 03:02:20.617]  I can't confirm everything you just said, but I can confirm the Saudi is the name of the country, which is being implicated, yes.
[03:02:22.138 --> 03:02:23.519]  And do you think it's going to be released?
[03:02:25.353 --> 03:02:31.055]  I'm working with a number of members of Congress and doing everything I can to help behind the scenes.
[03:02:31.575 --> 03:02:32.255]  I hope that they do.
[03:02:32.355 --> 03:02:34.476]  I know there's a coalition right now trying to get it released, Alex.
[03:02:35.136 --> 03:02:36.416]  I hope they get it released.
[03:02:36.456 --> 03:02:41.658]  That's right, you're working with Walter Jones of North Carolina and Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts.
[03:02:41.998 --> 03:02:42.718]  That's correct, yes.
[03:02:43.318 --> 03:02:46.799]  Well, you guys don't need to fly on any small planes, I'll tell you that.
[03:02:48.891 --> 03:02:49.772]  You have a lot of courage.
[03:02:49.792 --> 03:02:56.280]  Let me just, in the minute and a half we have left, because, I mean, you really are, like you said, and Congress was a rock star when it came to secret operations.
[03:02:57.061 --> 03:02:58.583]  How have you survived?
[03:02:58.643 --> 03:03:00.866]  I know you've been chewed out coming on this show and other things.
[03:03:01.227 --> 03:03:05.292]  I mean, is it because there's good people, white hats inside the system that are protecting you?
[03:03:06.108 --> 03:03:09.370]  Look, I don't make a lot of money.
[03:03:09.410 --> 03:03:11.151]  I still struggle like everybody does.
[03:03:11.171 --> 03:03:12.752]  This is not like a glamorous business.
[03:03:12.792 --> 03:03:13.652]  People may think it's not.
[03:03:13.692 --> 03:03:14.013]  It's not.
[03:03:14.593 --> 03:03:24.818]  And I've had a sufficient number of folks, Alex, who appreciated the fact that I'm telling the truth as best I can to get people, you know, I think the American people are owed the correct and truthful answer.
[03:03:24.959 --> 03:03:30.682]  And one of my guiding principles, for better or for worse, is I don't believe there's an expiration date on my oath of office.
[03:03:33.303 --> 03:03:38.448]  So, what I said when I first put the uniform on to me, it still applies to even me as a retired civilian.
[03:03:38.949 --> 03:03:42.492]  So, I'd like to believe that that's what, you know, drives me.
[03:03:42.852 --> 03:03:43.613]  It's tough to get up.
[03:03:43.713 --> 03:03:45.956]  This morning was tough to get up and face some of this stuff, Alex.
[03:03:45.976 --> 03:03:50.059]  But, you know, as best I can, I'm going to try to do what I think is best.
[03:03:50.420 --> 03:03:57.527]  Now, you told me something off-air that I know I can't get into, but you were just saying it's a very interesting environment right now on Capitol Hill.
[03:03:58.007 --> 03:03:58.187]  Right.
[03:03:58.607 --> 03:04:01.309]  There's a lot of things going on behind the scenes.
[03:04:02.190 --> 03:04:04.852]  A lot of what is going to happen next is going to depend on who gets the Senate.
[03:04:04.952 --> 03:04:14.679]  So, you know, there's a lot riding on the fact that I think a lot of people recognize, Alex, that this National Security Council, this president, has some real problems when it comes to national security.
[03:04:15.199 --> 03:04:19.582]  And I don't think they're going to be resolved unless Congress can get its own act together to help focus
[03:04:19.842 --> 03:04:32.052]  And the answer isn't giving 500 million to the other rebels, is the answer to what Rand Paul says, bombing them in Iraq and Syria, working with Assad, actually getting rid of them, and not starting an even bigger war if we don't.
[03:04:32.653 --> 03:04:34.334]  That's the right course of action.
[03:04:34.354 --> 03:04:44.463]  Plus, we're putting forward the idea of organizing an Arab NATO around Egypt and Libya, and Libya and Egypt and Jordan, to help actually do the boots on the ground when we need them.
[03:04:44.503 --> 03:04:46.985]  And trust me, Alex, the Egyptian military are very professional.
[03:04:48.041 --> 03:04:52.403]  All right, well, Colonel Schaefer, thank you so much for the time, and I look forward to speaking to you again soon.
[03:04:52.864 --> 03:04:53.244]  Thank you, sir.
[03:04:53.464 --> 03:04:53.784]  Thank you.
[03:04:53.904 --> 03:04:54.244]  All right.
[03:04:54.324 --> 03:04:55.425]  Powerful interview there.
[03:04:55.905 --> 03:04:59.627]  A lot of news-making intel there, I'll assure you.
[03:04:59.667 --> 03:05:02.609]  Just confirming what's in that 28 pages.
[03:05:02.909 --> 03:05:08.292]  I've confirmed it with others as well, but I've got to get my reporters busy on that, I can tell you.
[03:05:10.669 --> 03:05:16.322]  The Genesis Communications Network is one of America's premier broadcasters of captivating talk radio.
