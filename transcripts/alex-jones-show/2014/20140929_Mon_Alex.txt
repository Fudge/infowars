[00:00:02.693 --> 00:00:03.855]  Coast to coast.
[00:00:04.215 --> 00:00:05.517]  Direct from Austin.
[00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:09.484]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:16.772 --> 00:00:20.933]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:21.613 --> 00:00:22.414]  You want answers?
[00:00:23.194 --> 00:00:24.094]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:28.355]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:32.976]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.468 --> 00:00:43.070]  We were live here Friday.
[00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.134]  We're live today on this Monday edition, 29th day of September 2014.
[00:00:49.055 --> 00:01:03.909]  Before we knew any details of the beheading and attempted beheading, wounding of another woman at a factory facility up in Oklahoma and it wasn't hard to guess that it would be connected to radical Islam.
[00:01:06.394 --> 00:01:11.635]  But you see the media response since it's come out that indeed that's what happened, trying to cover it up.
[00:01:11.795 --> 00:01:15.836]  And I'm not one here calling for a Cold War with Muslims.
[00:01:15.896 --> 00:01:16.936]  I'm not an Islamophobe.
[00:01:16.996 --> 00:01:17.896]  Everybody knows that.
[00:01:18.797 --> 00:01:34.080]  But at the same time, when you have a real radical Islamic offensive that we've been talking about for a long time, four years at least, being launched worldwide and being funded by the highest levels of NATO and Western governments,
[00:01:35.623 --> 00:01:37.904]  You've got to ask, what's the end game plan here?
[00:01:40.465 --> 00:01:46.368]  Well, it's to bring in basically martial law under the name security.
[00:01:46.408 --> 00:01:48.489]  I mean, I was listening to local talk radio today.
[00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:51.170]  I was watching the news this morning, over the weekend.
[00:01:52.131 --> 00:01:56.172]  They were saying, oh, looks like those military equipment are needed to fight ISIS.
[00:01:57.353 --> 00:01:59.094]  Looks like it was the right thing to do.
[00:02:01.513 --> 00:02:24.170]  Was it military equipment, armored vehicles, checkpoints, NSA surveillance that stopped Alton Noland who tried to chop two women's heads off and successfully chopped one woman's head off before being shot by the CEO of the facility who had his concealed carry and mitigated it?
[00:02:25.631 --> 00:02:27.432]  Money on it, this guy would have probably stabbed 10-15 people.
[00:02:30.017 --> 00:02:41.277]  And of course you could go look Saturday and they already had found his Facebook with him showing off with the Islamic State flag and the rest of it promoting Islamic State and they were on CNN this morning.
[00:02:44.443 --> 00:02:47.505]  Saying, gee, we wonder if it's connected to any of that.
[00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:49.266]  Oh my goodness, we don't know.
[00:02:49.947 --> 00:02:55.931]  He has literally, in the last six months, been radicalized hanging around with these people.
[00:02:55.991 --> 00:03:04.677]  He was a football enthusiast slash Oklahoma Christian six and a half months ago on his Facebook post and then got immersed
[00:03:07.006 --> 00:03:08.688]  In a quote, radical mosque.
[00:03:09.648 --> 00:03:19.217]  So he kind of went from being a football player, godfather, thug life type guy, somebody who was on the edge, wanting to be tough, wanting to be a man.
[00:03:20.918 --> 00:03:26.343]  And I've pointed out that the way they use Facebook and Twitter, we're really seeing trendies with ISIS patches.
[00:03:26.383 --> 00:03:28.705]  We're really seeing it because celeb.
[00:03:28.745 --> 00:03:32.428]  We're really seeing it being promoted and pushed by the Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:03:33.397 --> 00:03:37.039]  And out of Kenya through Obama's cousins and half-brother and others.
[00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:49.786]  We really are seeing Google behind the Arab Spring and our government trying to overthrow the former Egyptian dictatorship of Hazem Mubarak to put something in far worse.
[00:03:50.486 --> 00:03:56.569]  And then our media criticizing the military after a year of tyrannical rule of the Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.831]  Something like 20 million Egyptians hit the streets protesting it.
[00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:08.212]  So the military took back over, stopped letting them burn down all the churches and crucify people, and our media, CNN, actually criticized it.
[00:04:09.013 --> 00:04:10.633]  So let's get one thing straight here.
[00:04:11.554 --> 00:04:27.499]  The people running our government, the special interest, are protecting, are funding, are shepherding, are opening the door for radical Wahhabist Islam to launch a jihad worldwide.
[00:04:28.513 --> 00:04:38.318]  And the whole build-up of Homeland Security in the last 12-13 years was in preparation for this, so that we will accept the police state takeover, which will then be flipped onto the Liberty Movement.
[00:04:38.658 --> 00:04:41.460]  Now, I told you that before it happened 13 years ago.
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.741]  It's now happened.
[00:04:42.781 --> 00:04:44.061]  You've now seen the flip begin.
[00:04:44.862 --> 00:04:52.266]  But they need another push to get the cops, the military, everybody to go along with it, so that they get in place
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:06.338]  Get accustomed to going through the motions before they publicly stage false flags in America and turn them loose on anybody who isn't a communist or a sympathizer with the globalists.
[00:05:06.418 --> 00:05:08.301]  We're going to break it all down straight ahead.
[00:05:10.953 --> 00:05:14.454]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:14.614 --> 00:05:18.575]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:18.876 --> 00:05:20.336]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:20.656 --> 00:05:28.238]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:29.359]  But for how long?
[00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:35.921]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:05:36.301 --> 00:05:39.122]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:05:40.532 --> 00:05:41.532]  DNA Force.
[00:05:41.592 --> 00:05:44.793]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:05:44.853 --> 00:05:45.893]  DNA Force.
[00:05:46.013 --> 00:05:54.055]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:05:54.175 --> 00:05:59.236]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:05:59.256 --> 00:06:00.257]  DNA Force.
[00:06:00.297 --> 00:06:02.157]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:06:11.764 --> 00:06:12.825]  In the near future.
[00:06:13.105 --> 00:06:16.748]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[00:06:16.768 --> 00:06:17.248]  Security alert.
[00:06:17.608 --> 00:06:18.629]  Security alert.
[00:06:18.829 --> 00:06:20.550]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:21.471]  Analysis.
[00:06:21.731 --> 00:06:22.371]  InfoWars.
[00:06:22.452 --> 00:06:24.393]  Building independent media operations.
[00:06:24.413 --> 00:06:29.396]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:06:29.436 --> 00:06:30.357]  Prime Directive.
[00:06:30.457 --> 00:06:31.918]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:06:32.018 --> 00:06:34.780]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.922]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:06:38.102 --> 00:06:40.264]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:06:40.384 --> 00:06:41.884]  These people are assaulting us!
[00:06:41.904 --> 00:06:44.265]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:06:44.745 --> 00:06:46.426]  They are never going to stop.
[00:06:46.686 --> 00:06:50.607]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[00:06:57.688 --> 00:06:58.429]  Imperative.
[00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:00.569]  Deploy Critical Minute TV.
[00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:05.090]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.511]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[00:07:10.956 --> 00:07:12.036]  Open your eyes.
[00:07:12.476 --> 00:07:15.397]  It's time to give your eyes a powerful nutritional boost.
[00:07:15.877 --> 00:07:22.019]  Sight is the primary input to the brain, arguably making eyesight the most important sense we have.
[00:07:22.359 --> 00:07:30.362]  And just like the other important organs in our bodies, our eyes function at peak levels when they are fed the proper amounts of essential nutrition.
[00:07:30.742 --> 00:07:31.782]  Open your eyes.
[00:07:32.122 --> 00:07:47.117]  Combining key ingredients like vitamin A, zinc, lutein, proprietary saffron bulb extracts and more, Occupower by InfoWars Life is the new formulation specifically designed to nutritionally assist the natural function of healthy eyes.

[00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:17.863]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:08:17.943 --> 00:08:22.065]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:22.325 --> 00:08:28.009]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.871]  Are we seeing the earth?
[00:08:31.931 --> 00:08:34.332]  You've got it.
[00:08:34.512 --> 00:08:38.174]  Are we seeing the earth now?
[00:08:38.255 --> 00:08:39.916]  You've got it.
[00:08:54.206 --> 00:09:00.692]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, the 29th day of September 2014.
[00:09:01.112 --> 00:09:02.694]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:09:04.495 --> 00:09:12.843]  And every day I seem to come on air and say, wow, our plate is certainly full, but that is not an attempt to make the broadcast sound interesting.
[00:09:12.863 --> 00:09:14.684]  I am completely overwhelmed.
[00:09:15.885 --> 00:09:16.586]  Bellying up.
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:28.023]  To this nightmaric bonanza, this virtual cornucopia of craziness.
[00:09:29.184 --> 00:09:32.885]  But sticking our heads in the sand will only make it worse.
[00:09:32.945 --> 00:09:38.127]  So that's why we're here, to break it down as a radar system and to try to navigate
[00:09:40.748 --> 00:09:53.438]  The planet terra firma approaching its carrying capacity for 7,350,000,000 souls aboard this planetoid.
[00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:05.568]  So fantastic to be here and I'm extremely honored to be your host but it's even more fantastic obviously to be a conscious sentient being
[00:10:07.375 --> 00:10:16.841]  Experiencing this existence with all of you, we are all truly brothers and sisters in that experience, no matter which side we serve.
[00:10:20.403 --> 00:10:23.025]  So always remember how epic consciousness is.
[00:10:23.705 --> 00:10:36.213]  The system, first and foremost, seeks to shudder the mind, to make you feel pointless and weak, and to make you bored, and to make you only tune in to their attempt at false reality,
[00:10:37.298 --> 00:10:40.762]  That is the state-run media and the controlled Hollywood culture.
[00:10:41.643 --> 00:10:47.810]  It is an attempt for them to force you into their artificial consciousness, their system of total control.
[00:10:48.251 --> 00:10:56.421]  And this revolt that I am only a small part of is truly a revolt demanding free will.
[00:11:00.041 --> 00:11:13.047]  And for the self-determination to at least be able to make some of the basic decisions governing all of our individual and, yes, collective destinies as a species.
[00:11:14.468 --> 00:11:15.268]  I am honored to be here.
[00:11:15.308 --> 00:11:16.028]  Thank you so much.
[00:11:16.428 --> 00:11:19.410]  The news websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:26.273]  Obviously, we have Obama coming out saying that they underestimated Islamic State threat.
[00:11:29.414 --> 00:11:40.316]  Islamic State was built by NATO, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, basically everyone in the Middle East, but Iran and Syria and Egypt and Libya.
[00:11:42.256 --> 00:11:56.259]  That matter of a country was our ally or neutral, it's been overthrown and handed over to Islamic State, known as Al-Qaeda, known as Wahhabis, known as Sunni radical arm, the paramilitary takeover arm of Saudi Arabia.
[00:12:00.288 --> 00:12:25.090]  And this is all being done because they know the military finally clicked, finally had a paradigm moment when the light bulb ignited above the head and realized, oh my gosh, there's a global shadow corporate chaos organization that consolidates power out of worldwide crises that is protecting and shepherding radical Islam.
[00:12:28.613 --> 00:12:29.894]  And we don't want to be part of it.
[00:12:30.755 --> 00:12:48.988]  And so once this force had been turned loose, now they have to have some staged bombings of it to try to get the narrative back to Homeland Security and the other Homeland Security systems in Australia, England, Germany, you name it.
[00:12:49.888 --> 00:12:56.213]  They need to now legitimize, not just to us, but to their own people who are really now sitting back
[00:12:57.915 --> 00:12:58.976]  Decompartmentalizing.
[00:13:00.678 --> 00:13:01.379]  So we have that.
[00:13:03.481 --> 00:13:07.066]  We have a little small hors d'oeuvre.
[00:13:09.288 --> 00:13:17.678]  With 36 confirmed dead when a volcano erupted in Japan, spewing ash and toxic fumes.
[00:13:21.055 --> 00:13:32.184]  By comparison, in the reports I've got here, they estimate that the Yellowstone volcano, the supervolcano, the biggest known in the world, there's several, but it's now active.
[00:13:32.204 --> 00:13:33.685]  I want to say that again, active.
[00:13:34.466 --> 00:13:37.228]  And with their computer algorithms, they estimate it will erupt soon.
[00:13:37.648 --> 00:13:40.771]  Now that means the next hundred years, but now it's moving even quicker.
[00:13:41.812 --> 00:13:43.173]  They think it erupts every few million.
[00:13:45.902 --> 00:13:51.186]  That it is between 10 and 20,000 times bigger than what this volcano eruption was.
[00:13:51.927 --> 00:13:53.809]  Hundreds of times bigger than Mount St.
[00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:54.149]  Helens.
[00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:58.533]  Covering more than half the United States in molten ash.
[00:14:01.255 --> 00:14:04.498]  Changing the climate of the planet, sending us into a dark age.
[00:14:05.118 --> 00:14:08.361]  It erupted 2.1 million years ago, 1.3 million years ago, 640,000 years ago according to the isotope readings.
[00:14:13.729 --> 00:14:16.271]  The biggest eruption was 640,000 years ago.
[00:14:20.053 --> 00:14:42.488]  And I'm not saying this is imminent in a human lifetime scale, but it just shows you when they say we need to have stable climate and pay a UN body and Homeland Security domestically to quote, prosecute green crimes of not throwing your recycling away or whatever, that it has nothing to do with protecting anybody.
[00:14:44.656 --> 00:15:05.691]  And everything about surveilling and micromanaging every facet of our lives, as a world unifying religion, that isn't even based on real sensible environmental crises and problems that are happening that need to be dealt with, it's a cover for all of that, as all the GMO and pharmacological crops and cross-species abominations and
[00:15:06.849 --> 00:15:20.639]  Human cloning and chimeras, spider goats, and all glow-in-the-dark dogs, all of it racing forward and we're talking about carbon dioxide and how we've got to have a totally stable climate with no change.
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.001]  The only thing that's stable is change.
[00:15:24.421 --> 00:15:26.162]  The only thing constant is change.
[00:15:26.443 --> 00:15:28.324]  The only thing that continues to happen is change.
[00:15:28.524 --> 00:15:32.527]  Anyone with a literal IQ of 60 points knows that.
[00:15:34.377 --> 00:15:36.058]  But they insult everyone's intelligence.
[00:15:36.118 --> 00:15:39.260]  I saw, no exaggeration, probably 25 articles or more last week.
[00:15:39.681 --> 00:15:45.665]  Mainstream headlines, Smithsonian, NASA, Washington Post, CBS.
[00:15:46.385 --> 00:15:48.287]  No one questions climate change.
[00:15:48.307 --> 00:15:49.368]  It's now not global warming.
[00:15:49.788 --> 00:15:57.613]  And then quotes about, we must not have climate change denial, and we must get the taxes in place to do it, and Obama's gonna act with executive orders regardless.
[00:16:00.956 --> 00:16:02.357]  To protect us from climate change.
[00:16:04.048 --> 00:16:12.134]  When giant asteroids hit the Earth all the time, there's huge volcanoes everywhere, how many civilizations got covered in lava in five minutes like Pompeii?
[00:16:16.077 --> 00:16:16.857]  Krakatoa?
[00:16:19.839 --> 00:16:20.780]  It's just ridiculous!
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.522]  We're on a planet that hadn't even cooled!
[00:16:24.683 --> 00:16:33.249]  With about a mile, two mile thick, depending on where you're at, some places even thinner, floating islands of mountains
[00:16:34.404 --> 00:16:51.958]  Flying at hundreds of thousands of miles an hour through space orbiting a sun out on the edge of a galaxy and we really are worshipping Hollywood stars and Obama and red carpets?
[00:16:52.238 --> 00:16:54.780]  I mean, give me a break!
[00:16:57.125 --> 00:17:00.747]  Go out to West Texas when it's a clear sky, no moon, you'll just fall to your knees.
[00:17:00.767 --> 00:17:02.808]  It's like the stars are just coming down.
[00:17:03.288 --> 00:17:08.790]  The stars are big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:17:11.112 --> 00:17:12.552]  What's that song I remember singing when I was a kid?
[00:17:13.653 --> 00:17:18.615]  The stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:17:19.315 --> 00:17:20.896]  I mean, that's incredible.
[00:17:21.516 --> 00:17:22.257]  What's the Bible say?
[00:17:22.277 --> 00:17:24.618]  You can see God's handiwork in the firmament.
[00:17:28.266 --> 00:17:44.572]  And it is shifting from looking at the dirt and the amoeba-like globalist, and shifting and seeing the big picture, transcending them, just that thought alone begins the journey of escaping this devilish construct they're trying to build.
[00:17:45.553 --> 00:17:50.755]  This technological terror they've constructed to quote Darth Vader.
[00:17:55.239 --> 00:17:58.140]  The arrogance and the hubris of the wicked.
[00:18:02.641 --> 00:18:04.642]  The fool and his money are quickly parted.
[00:18:05.682 --> 00:18:09.043]  More like the fool is quickly parted from his own consciousness and free will.
[00:18:11.444 --> 00:18:13.564]  And all I want people to do is to think for themselves.
[00:18:15.525 --> 00:18:21.587]  The minute we heard about a beheading and a man trying to behead another person, I mean, we knew what it was going to be.
[00:18:22.751 --> 00:18:23.892]  And it's hype!
[00:18:24.412 --> 00:18:35.441]  This guy, the so-called suspect, even though he was seen by over 100 people, Alton Nolan, was killed by the CEO of the company in Oklahoma, who had his concealed carry.
[00:18:36.122 --> 00:18:46.370]  And within a minute and a half of the attack happening, the head of the company went in, the AP reports, and the police report.
[00:18:46.891 --> 00:18:48.472]  They were finally forced to report this.
[00:18:48.492 --> 00:18:49.433]  This was out on Saturday.
[00:18:53.237 --> 00:18:53.997]  He wounded him.
[00:18:54.978 --> 00:19:09.164]  A man fired from an Oklahoma food processing plant beheaded a woman with a knife was attacking another worker when he was shot and wounded by a company official.
[00:19:09.224 --> 00:19:10.785]  Police said Friday.
[00:19:12.806 --> 00:19:16.947]  Alton Nolan having a Freudian slip saying killing him.
[00:19:16.967 --> 00:19:17.788]  I wish he would have killed him.
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:24.345]  Because that's a true crime of hate, to be able to take a knife and go in and saw somebody's head off.
[00:19:28.028 --> 00:19:38.097]  See, young males that haven't had good fatherly role models, it's just a statistical factor, four to seven times more likely to end up in prison, to end up being violent, to end up being thugs.
[00:19:39.098 --> 00:19:45.684]  It's the exact same statistics for a white kid or a black kid, except that blacks are two or three times more likely to be illegitimate now.
[00:19:47.844 --> 00:19:49.104]  And we've talked a lot about this.
[00:19:49.885 --> 00:19:56.187]  And so instead of being a gangster now, because he was into being that previously on his Facebook, a godfather, mac daddy gangster.
[00:19:56.747 --> 00:20:00.028]  Then in the last six months, he got into radical Islam, started attending radical mosque.
[00:20:00.768 --> 00:20:02.229]  And then, well, look what happened.
[00:20:05.419 --> 00:20:10.446]  And it's a pure copycat hype event, but what about real ISIS sleeper cells?
[00:20:20.239 --> 00:20:23.642]  Are you happy paying new higher prices for smaller boxes?

[00:20:40.416 --> 00:20:42.857]  Are you ready to surrender your right to buy body armor?
[00:20:43.137 --> 00:20:43.777]  No joke.
[00:20:43.917 --> 00:20:46.517]  Congress is now trying to outlaw civilian body armor.
[00:20:46.597 --> 00:20:48.918]  And if House Bill H.R.
[00:20:49.198 --> 00:20:53.559]  5344 becomes law, you can kiss your right to protect yourself against rifle bullets goodbye.
[00:20:53.699 --> 00:20:56.360]  Don't put off your body armor purchase any longer.

[00:21:04.042 --> 00:21:06.782]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L.
[00:21:07.022 --> 00:21:08.383]  Infidel Body Armor.
[00:21:08.463 --> 00:21:09.583]  Just won't quit.
[00:21:10.023 --> 00:21:13.685]  We all have our own idea about what being safe and secure means.
[00:21:14.005 --> 00:21:19.228]  The doors lock, bills are paid, you've got a job that keeps the lights on, and a home to call your own.
[00:21:19.508 --> 00:21:21.830]  But what happens when Mother Nature throws a curveball?
[00:21:24.717 --> 00:21:28.660]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time?
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.541]  Do you even have a plan B?
[00:21:31.102 --> 00:21:34.184]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[00:21:34.404 --> 00:21:35.625]  Children left with no home.
[00:21:35.645 --> 00:21:36.986]  And no one's coming to help them.
[00:21:37.487 --> 00:21:40.329]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster.
[00:21:40.529 --> 00:21:42.731]  It's a visit to mypatriotsupply.com.

[00:22:09.887 --> 00:22:15.833]  If you have Candida overgrowth, just taking antifungal agents or starving yourself of sweets does not address the cause.
[00:22:15.953 --> 00:22:21.638]  Candida overgrowth is the result of a toxic, damaged, acidic, low oxygen, and inflamed tissue environment.
[00:22:21.718 --> 00:22:28.685]  The goal should be to remove the toxins, heal damaged tissues, restore healthy pH, eliminate inflammation, and feed beneficial bacteria.
[00:22:28.925 --> 00:22:37.994]  Previous usage of antibiotics or steroids or exposure to mercury or other toxins can damage many cells in the GI tract and body that make you prone to Candida overgrowth.
[00:22:38.154 --> 00:22:40.917]  Removing toxins and healing tissues should be the goal.
[00:22:41.177 --> 00:22:50.446]  One World Whey is a whey protein food that supports detoxification, repair of tissues, and elimination of inflammation, healthy pH, and growth of beneficial bacteria.
[00:22:50.746 --> 00:22:54.628]  One World Whey is duly reformulated to be higher in protein and lower in carbohydrate.
[00:22:54.808 --> 00:23:00.691]  We believe One World Whey is an excellent food to support your efforts to create a healthy internal body environment.
[00:23:00.871 --> 00:23:03.512]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[00:23:03.592 --> 00:23:05.493]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[00:23:09.201 --> 00:23:13.102]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being.
[00:23:13.303 --> 00:23:17.664]  And you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[00:23:17.844 --> 00:23:24.086]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[00:23:24.346 --> 00:23:28.128]  Now, our extra-strength new nascent iodine formula is here.
[00:23:28.348 --> 00:23:29.748]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:23:30.009 --> 00:23:33.970]  Leading the way into the next generation of super high-quality nascent iodine.
[00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:42.433]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200-plus million-year-old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[00:23:42.814 --> 00:23:50.797]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients, and completely vegan.
[00:23:50.917 --> 00:23:54.378]  We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 iodine for radiation.
[00:23:54.578 --> 00:24:03.242]  Pure, clean, and sourced from deep within the Earth, X2 nascent iodine is available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com,
[00:24:03.522 --> 00:24:04.063]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:24:04.203 --> 00:24:28.164]  I don't have to see for miles and miles, even though I can, to see a screw job in the making, happening right in front of me.
[00:24:29.505 --> 00:24:30.165]  Here's an example.
[00:24:30.185 --> 00:24:30.665]  The U.S.
[00:24:30.705 --> 00:24:32.106]  ambassador to the U.N.
[00:24:32.686 --> 00:24:47.312]  said about a week and a half ago, we played the clip here two or three times, that yeah, of course taking out ISIL is about taking out Assad, their arch enemy, who's done nothing but fought al Qaeda for four years with our government arming them.
[00:24:49.372 --> 00:24:55.295]  And now the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the U.S., the video's up on Infowars.com,
[00:24:58.203 --> 00:25:03.986]  Came out on 60 Minutes yesterday and said, yeah, we need to take out ISIL and take out Assad.
[00:25:04.526 --> 00:25:09.529]  That's how dumb they think we are.
[00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:12.531]  It first aired on 60 Minutes.
[00:25:12.551 --> 00:25:18.434]  It also then aired on This Morning with anchor Nora O'Donnell.
[00:25:19.134 --> 00:25:20.515]  I'm not even going to play the clip, OK?
[00:25:21.215 --> 00:25:22.396]  It's just so insulting.
[00:25:24.284 --> 00:25:30.309]  That, you know what, I don't start fights, I don't back invading countries that haven't done anything and blowing up every church.
[00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:37.615]  It's not rocket science to say it's wrong for our government and NATO for four years!
[00:25:38.276 --> 00:25:42.279]  I know I keep harping on this, but it's just so incredible how dumb they think we are, and I guess we are.
[00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:50.286]  To be pumping billions of dollars in, 600 tons of weapons, just the last month or so,
[00:25:53.331 --> 00:26:00.032]  As Senator Paul talked about, into ISIS, they're not getting whole warehouses of armored vehicles and U.S.
[00:26:00.072 --> 00:26:02.813]  Special Forces trucks and U.S.
[00:26:03.073 --> 00:26:09.294]  M-16s at military bases we just left in eastern or western Iraq.
[00:26:10.514 --> 00:26:11.315]  They've been given them.
[00:26:13.255 --> 00:26:15.996]  And our military is completely freaked out, and they should be.
[00:26:19.176 --> 00:26:22.637]  And all of this is about covering Obama's
[00:26:23.612 --> 00:26:33.961]  But, and Hillary Clinton's and the rest of them, and Senator Graham, and Senator McCain, who's so angry at Rand Paul, who keeps saying, you met with ISIS.
[00:26:34.521 --> 00:26:35.542]  And then he goes, that's ridiculous.
[00:26:35.562 --> 00:26:37.083]  Well, actually I did, but so what?
[00:26:37.324 --> 00:26:38.264]  You should go meet with them too.
[00:26:38.304 --> 00:26:39.425]  And then all these headlines.
[00:26:39.505 --> 00:26:40.987]  Rand Paul got caught in a hoax.
[00:26:41.227 --> 00:26:42.228]  McCain never met with anybody.
[00:26:42.468 --> 00:26:42.908]  Boom!
[00:26:43.529 --> 00:26:46.031]  I remember two years ago showing the video, the photos.
[00:26:46.231 --> 00:26:47.112]  He was proud of it.
[00:26:48.253 --> 00:26:51.636]  And half the guys he met with are the leaders of Islamic State.
[00:26:52.452 --> 00:26:56.454]  But they think you're so dumb, they're still up there lying about it!
[00:26:57.914 --> 00:27:00.735]  And now, the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the U.S.
[00:27:00.775 --> 00:27:06.878]  tells CBS News, yeah, it's about taking out Assad after we take out ISIS.
[00:27:09.919 --> 00:27:10.099]  What?
[00:27:11.139 --> 00:27:13.900]  It's about turning that place over to Saudi Arabia.
[00:27:14.481 --> 00:27:15.781]  Saudi Arabia conquered it before.
[00:27:16.942 --> 00:27:17.502]  Last century.
[00:27:18.322 --> 00:27:18.702]  Syria.
[00:27:19.683 --> 00:27:20.163]  Damascus.
[00:27:22.085 --> 00:27:23.186]  And so it's just all about smoke.
[00:27:23.407 --> 00:27:26.850]  So everybody's like, oh my gosh, what's going to happen?
[00:27:27.071 --> 00:27:28.532]  Oh, I guess we had to take them out.
[00:27:28.552 --> 00:27:31.315]  Well, of course, of course, Al Qaeda needs to be destroyed.
[00:27:31.355 --> 00:27:31.916]  It's horrible.
[00:27:33.217 --> 00:27:36.100]  And let me tell you, people say, Alex, you're the one always saying terror is fake.
[00:27:37.085 --> 00:27:39.248]  Why are you saying Islamic State's a real threat now?
[00:27:40.189 --> 00:27:42.272]  Well, I always said there's different types of terror.
[00:27:42.292 --> 00:27:43.574]  There's purely provocateur.
[00:27:43.634 --> 00:27:46.518]  There's wind-up toys where you find mentally ill people and get them to do it.
[00:27:47.199 --> 00:27:54.729]  There's systems where you open the door for terrorists to attack and use the NSA systems to make sure other agencies that are doing their job aren't able to stop them.
[00:27:55.742 --> 00:28:00.163]  Because literally like 98% of the government is compartmentalized and didn't know this stuff was going on.
[00:28:00.483 --> 00:28:05.805]  Now that it's all out in the open, it's the decompartmentalization that could destroy the new world order, folks.
[00:28:06.305 --> 00:28:16.088]  I remember three years ago at Bilderberg, we got the intel from sources inside that they were having main meetings about how to spin that they weren't behind Al-Qaeda and how to cover it up.
[00:28:18.493 --> 00:28:19.494]  The head of NATO was there.
[00:28:20.254 --> 00:28:24.396]  And they were really upset because their narrative was being disrupted.
[00:28:24.636 --> 00:28:28.679]  And the fact that Arab Spring had been launched by them was starting to come out.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:34.722]  And so now Obama's running around saying, we were caught flat-footed!
[00:28:34.762 --> 00:28:36.423]  Well, I got bad intelligence!
[00:28:37.711 --> 00:28:38.651]  Bad intelligence.
[00:28:38.691 --> 00:28:51.696]  They have armed over 100,000 of these jihadis, bare minimum, given them the weapons, turned them loose, all over the place, and the media has backed them, overthrowing Libya, Syria, Egypt, and other areas.
[00:28:51.796 --> 00:28:53.056]  You all saw them do that.
[00:28:54.597 --> 00:28:55.737]  So this is a challenge here.
[00:28:55.797 --> 00:28:56.837]  Are we this dumb?
[00:28:56.857 --> 00:28:59.358]  Well, let me tell you, the public may be dumb.
[00:29:00.859 --> 00:29:01.919]  The military's not.
[00:29:03.615 --> 00:29:05.717]  They all know the players, they all know what's going on.
[00:29:05.737 --> 00:29:07.499]  Let me tell you who else knows.
[00:29:08.259 --> 00:29:09.340]  Quote law enforcement.
[00:29:10.001 --> 00:29:12.704]  Only because they actually have to study these groups and organizations.
[00:29:13.284 --> 00:29:15.326]  And so they know this is completely phony.
[00:29:15.686 --> 00:29:18.849]  So the question is, do you trust a government that's doing stuff like this?
[00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:20.151]  That's all I'm saying.
[00:29:20.371 --> 00:29:25.376]  Because when we come back, the next phase that I've been warning you about is beheadings in America.
[00:29:26.732 --> 00:29:36.055]  Then mass shootings of schools, factories, universities, federal buildings, and a big truck full of plastic explosives rolling right into the White House.
[00:29:36.695 --> 00:29:38.916]  When Obama will be gone, don't worry when they do that.
[00:29:39.456 --> 00:29:40.536]  Oh, he'll be such a hero!
[00:29:40.896 --> 00:29:44.197]  Or the president took off a helicopter a minute before when they got a warning.
[00:29:44.458 --> 00:29:48.559]  I mean, I'm throwing out these scenarios because I know how they work, so they can't pull them.
[00:29:49.665 --> 00:29:50.826]  And believe me, I'm not being arrogant.
[00:29:50.846 --> 00:29:57.829]  They watch, they listen, and then this decompartmentalizes all the Secret Service and other people that are good to know what to look for.
[00:29:58.269 --> 00:29:59.710]  They could blow up Congress, folks.
[00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:03.052]  I'm telling you, they're getting ready to pull something big.
[00:30:03.212 --> 00:30:05.072]  My spider sense feels it.
[00:30:05.112 --> 00:30:06.673]  You've heard me saying it.
[00:30:06.753 --> 00:30:07.754]  Now you're seeing it start.
[00:30:10.874 --> 00:30:19.358]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being, and you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[00:30:19.538 --> 00:30:25.761]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[00:30:26.061 --> 00:30:29.827]  Now, our extra strength new nascent iodine formula is here.
[00:30:30.047 --> 00:30:31.429]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:35.736]  Leading the way into the next generation of super high quality nascent iodine.
[00:30:35.876 --> 00:30:41.265]  Info Wars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200 plus million year old salt solutions.
[00:30:41.465 --> 00:30:44.166]  Found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[00:30:44.546 --> 00:30:52.528]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients, and completely vegan.
[00:30:52.648 --> 00:30:56.109]  We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 iodine for radiation.
[00:30:56.309 --> 00:31:05.651]  Pure, clean, and sourced from deep within the Earth, X2 nascent iodine is available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:31:11.121 --> 00:31:16.522]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:31:17.762 --> 00:31:22.524]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:31:22.904 --> 00:31:29.685]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:31:31.626 --> 00:31:33.786]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:31:35.686 --> 00:31:38.007]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:51.671]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:31:51.931 --> 00:31:53.433]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:31:53.713 --> 00:31:56.295]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:31:56.595 --> 00:32:02.859]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.

[00:32:05.921 --> 00:32:07.342]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:32:07.522 --> 00:32:07.963]  Got it.
[00:32:08.303 --> 00:32:09.104]  Others don't.
[00:32:10.566 --> 00:32:11.807]  Another major health threat.
[00:32:11.827 --> 00:32:16.729]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:32:16.809 --> 00:32:19.450]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:26.253]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:32:26.513 --> 00:32:29.374]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:32:29.514 --> 00:32:32.456]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:32:32.536 --> 00:32:34.457]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:32:34.477 --> 00:32:37.298]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:32:37.398 --> 00:32:42.920]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.621]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:32:46.641 --> 00:32:49.622]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:32:49.722 --> 00:32:56.824]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[00:33:08.548 --> 00:33:14.712]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[00:33:15.192 --> 00:33:15.652]  A lie!
[00:33:16.072 --> 00:33:17.793]  No man is obsolete!
[00:33:18.074 --> 00:33:19.895]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[00:33:19.935 --> 00:33:22.836]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[00:33:23.197 --> 00:33:28.279]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.301]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth!
[00:33:30.341 --> 00:33:31.461]  A crawling insect!
[00:33:31.842 --> 00:33:35.884]  An ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[00:33:36.504 --> 00:33:37.585]  I am a human being!
[00:33:37.985 --> 00:33:45.189]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind!
[00:33:45.729 --> 00:33:46.450]  I don't care!
[00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:47.890]  I tell you, I don't care!
[00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:49.291]  I'm a human being!
[00:33:49.491 --> 00:33:50.032]  I exist!
[00:33:50.132 --> 00:33:54.234]  And if I speak one thought aloud, that thought lives!
[00:33:54.981 --> 00:33:56.783]  Even after I'm summoned into my grave!
[00:33:57.183 --> 00:33:59.906]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[00:34:00.346 --> 00:34:07.773]  Delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength when you have no strength at all!
[00:34:08.033 --> 00:34:10.575]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream!
[00:34:10.996 --> 00:34:13.418]  And the state has no use for your kind!
[00:34:15.099 --> 00:34:18.602]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:34:19.183 --> 00:34:20.905]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:34:23.638 --> 00:34:26.720]  The inventor of the World Wide Web warns of threat to Internet freedom.
[00:34:27.561 --> 00:34:29.662]  Says a global tyranny is taking over.
[00:34:32.504 --> 00:34:38.748]  William Binney, number four at the NSA, a director of their technical operations and development.
[00:34:40.205 --> 00:34:51.611]  They say, even ABC News says, one of the greatest codebreakers and mathematicians in NSA history says it is a total totalitarian takeover with the destruction of free will in mind.
[00:34:51.991 --> 00:34:52.391]  I don't know.
[00:34:52.631 --> 00:34:57.413]  We now have Sir Tim Berners-Lee saying there's a global takeover.
[00:34:57.453 --> 00:34:58.114]  That's AFP.
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:03.261]  We have the former director of the NSA saying it's a totalitarian takeover.
[00:35:04.561 --> 00:35:08.122]  I mean, people say, if there was a takeover happening, people would warn us.
[00:35:08.462 --> 00:35:09.902]  There are good people in the system.
[00:35:11.382 --> 00:35:27.806]  I had Colonel Schaefer on about a month ago, and he said, if you want to know what I really think, because he still gives classified briefings to Congress, interview this gentleman, Mr. Steele, who was a CIA actual field commander with the Army.
[00:35:29.005 --> 00:35:34.287]  And then we get Steele on, and Steele starts saying, this is a false flag, that's a false flag.
[00:35:34.487 --> 00:35:39.048]  They're bringing in martial law because ISIS basically works for them.
[00:35:40.228 --> 00:35:41.569]  Because that's what's going on.
[00:35:43.469 --> 00:35:44.230]  Do you understand that?
[00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:47.691]  We're not up here playing patty cake making stuff up.
[00:35:48.431 --> 00:35:57.814]  When I tell you that they're getting ready to release brigade level, I'm talking 3, 4, 5,000 terrorist sleepers in this country.
[00:35:59.226 --> 00:36:03.048]  That's the type of capabilities from my research that Islamic State has in this country.
[00:36:03.268 --> 00:36:10.633]  This isn't some fake Al-Qaeda wing, cutouts, decoys set up on 9-11 who are really on CIA payroll.
[00:36:10.873 --> 00:36:11.553]  That's confirmed.
[00:36:12.434 --> 00:36:13.675]  That's London Guardian.
[00:36:14.255 --> 00:36:18.017]  That they were at least double agents, bare minimum, and we're being lied to about what really happened.
[00:36:18.438 --> 00:36:22.000]  The 28 pages that Saudi Arabia was intimately involved.
[00:36:22.813 --> 00:36:25.174]  And then our government ordered a stand-down, bare minimum.
[00:36:25.374 --> 00:36:27.694]  That's been confirmed by Congressman Walter Jones.
[00:36:27.934 --> 00:36:29.875]  That's read the 28 pages.
[00:36:30.595 --> 00:36:35.937]  That's been confirmed by Colonel Butler, who was there that day he was on three weeks ago, briefing Congress.
[00:36:37.017 --> 00:36:45.799]  Congress was told in briefings 95% of the Islamic Jihad force attacking Syria is IS.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:47.740]  That's just a catch-all.
[00:36:49.283 --> 00:36:50.144]  I don't know.
[00:37:02.591 --> 00:37:14.794]  They couldn't get a resupply because Congress blocked the funds, and the Pentagon refused to ship the weapons, because the pilots came on this show and literally got death-threatened and everything else, and subpoenaed by the Justice Department.
[00:37:15.034 --> 00:37:19.375]  People are like, oh, there's good people in the CIA, they would ship guns to Al-Qaeda.
[00:37:19.595 --> 00:37:22.115]  Well, they came on the show and told us all about it.
[00:37:23.175 --> 00:37:25.276]  Tosh Plumlee, what do you think that was?
[00:37:27.736 --> 00:37:31.077]  The Pentagon wouldn't do it, so they said, okay, just come into Iraq, resupply there.
[00:37:34.281 --> 00:37:37.102]  And they do it through Saudi Arabia so they can have plausible deniability.
[00:37:37.562 --> 00:37:39.083]  They can fence the money, the weapons.
[00:37:44.205 --> 00:37:46.145]  This is what's happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:46.746 --> 00:38:03.332]  And so, if I wanted to overthrow America, if I wanted to overthrow what's left of Western civilization, if I wanted to bring in a tyranny, so I could then turn the West into an armored compound to launch a global war worldwide to take over the planet for the bankers.
[00:38:04.611 --> 00:38:09.815]  And destroy the other free countries and the other rogue countries, as well as the West, while I was at it.
[00:38:11.597 --> 00:38:16.541]  I would fund radical jihadists worldwide to threaten the West, to stage horrible atrocities.
[00:38:16.901 --> 00:38:25.749]  I would then give them part of the Middle East as their payoff, have their patsies commanded by shadow forces, attack real installations.
[00:38:25.929 --> 00:38:26.930]  They will really be killed.
[00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:29.472]  There will be real wars with our troops and these people.
[00:38:29.772 --> 00:38:31.673]  There will be real police killed by these people.
[00:38:31.974 --> 00:38:33.135]  It's a real world
[00:38:34.426 --> 00:38:34.746]  Fight!
[00:38:35.927 --> 00:38:40.528]  But the whole thing is simulated at the top and is synthetic.
[00:38:40.969 --> 00:38:42.829]  The word they use is synthetic.
[00:38:43.049 --> 00:38:46.951]  This is an artificially manufactured, created system.
[00:38:56.635 --> 00:38:57.535]  And the next move...
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:00.981]  It could be a nuke.
[00:39:01.021 --> 00:39:02.802]  They've put a lot of pre-programming out on that.
[00:39:03.262 --> 00:39:04.323]  Going off in a major city.
[00:39:04.483 --> 00:39:05.383]  A huge dirty bomb.
[00:39:07.345 --> 00:39:09.006]  But they really want to go after guns.
[00:39:12.548 --> 00:39:19.332]  So they'll probably target a Democratic-controlled area where they know they've got a lot of tied-up victims with nobody there to protect them.
[00:39:20.553 --> 00:39:22.815]  New York, Chicago, D.C.
[00:39:24.756 --> 00:39:26.177]  And they'll go in and just kill it.
[00:39:26.637 --> 00:39:27.057]  It could be 200 kids.
[00:39:30.871 --> 00:39:32.693]  And then they'll spin it, we need gun control.
[00:39:33.134 --> 00:39:39.061]  See, these local ISIS sympathizers got their guns legally at gun shows.
[00:39:39.561 --> 00:39:45.068]  I mean, just think about the enemy's mind, learn how they operate, and what would you do if they were them?
[00:39:45.568 --> 00:39:48.932]  That's how I continue to predict what they're going to pull.
[00:39:49.073 --> 00:39:50.755]  You would do something like that, or
[00:39:56.226 --> 00:40:00.570]  By the way, people that say, oh, don't give him any ideas, believe me, these people already have all these ideas.
[00:40:03.712 --> 00:40:05.014]  Let me assure you of that.
[00:40:09.698 --> 00:40:17.644]  Do you know what a hundred real trained terrorists with asymmetrical warfare can do to an industrialized country?
[00:40:20.507 --> 00:40:21.868]  Just unbelievable habit.
[00:40:24.355 --> 00:40:38.748]  And remember, while our southern and northern borders are wide open, they are saying we've got to have the armored vehicles and paramilitary police to counter ISIS when their training is for the Tea Party and gun owners and veterans.
[00:40:39.249 --> 00:40:46.035]  And when they're done letting the jihadis attack the West and shoot down airliners with Stinger missiles that our government gave them $15,000 of, bare minimum,
[00:40:49.588 --> 00:40:57.791]  They are going to come after all of us claiming that somehow we were involved or somehow, you know, we launched terror attacks.
[00:40:59.852 --> 00:41:00.913]  It's a script they're following.
[00:41:03.074 --> 00:41:06.695]  And so I harp on this a lot because this is what I fear.
[00:41:07.135 --> 00:41:10.737]  These are the moves I would make if I was the establishment.
[00:41:11.097 --> 00:41:14.278]  Plus, we've caught them doing this stuff over and over again.
[00:41:16.439 --> 00:41:18.380]  So for me, it's not a question of if but when.
[00:41:23.359 --> 00:41:25.620]  And it's really hard to cover all this other news when we know this.
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:38.945]  Here's Obama, though, trying to distance himself from the stand down of letting 100,000, there's over 200,000 fighters estimated in Syria attacking Assad and the military.
[00:41:38.965 --> 00:41:51.050]  200,000 head choppers, 100,000 whatever it is, they try to downgrade the numbers to, you know, 13,000, 20,000, actual ISIL, ISIL, the names are all meant to confuse people, we know that.
[00:41:51.857 --> 00:42:00.923]  Pouring back into Iraq, and Obama is saying that it's underestimated Islamic State threat.
[00:42:01.063 --> 00:42:01.963]  Underestimated?
[00:42:01.983 --> 00:42:07.607]  That's like Dr. Frankenstein saying he underestimated what his monster would do.
[00:42:09.889 --> 00:42:10.869]  Let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[00:42:12.469 --> 00:42:22.591]  I think our head of the intelligence community, Jim Clappers, acknowledged that I think they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria.
[00:42:23.692 --> 00:42:35.454]  Essentially what happened with ISIL was that you had al-Qaeda in Iraq, which was a vicious group, but our Marines were able to quash with the help of Sunni tribes.
[00:42:36.514 --> 00:42:38.534]  They went back underground.
[00:42:39.075 --> 00:43:04.740]  But over the past couple of years, during the chaos of the Syrian Civil War, where essentially you have huge swaths of the country that are completely ungoverned, they were able to reconstitute themselves and take advantage of that chaos and attract foreign fighters who believed in their jihadist nonsense and traveled everywhere from Europe and the United States to Australia.
[00:43:05.447 --> 00:43:06.767]  Notice how everything's a manipulate.
[00:43:07.568 --> 00:43:10.148]  Our Marines were able to quash, crush them.
[00:43:13.849 --> 00:43:14.470]  Which is true.
[00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:20.411]  That was like six years ago, right as you got into office, that was already done.
[00:43:21.372 --> 00:43:26.353]  And then they were allowed, as we told you three, four years ago, to set up bases in Western Iraq.
[00:43:28.953 --> 00:43:35.798]  To prepare for the attack into Syria, and to set up bases in Jordan, and bases in Turkey, and bases in the Golan Heights.
[00:43:35.918 --> 00:43:36.659]  Israel helped them.
[00:43:36.999 --> 00:43:37.920]  This is in the news!
[00:43:38.921 --> 00:43:40.502]  This is admitted in Jerusalem Post!
[00:43:42.704 --> 00:43:48.208]  To then launch this all-out coordinated attack, and the argument was, oh, it doesn't matter, they're the only ones that'll fight.
[00:43:48.228 --> 00:43:55.713]  Remember three years ago, in Council on Foreign Relations, Foreign Affairs publication, they had the headline, Why We Need Al-Qaeda.
[00:43:56.516 --> 00:43:58.217]  And it said, well, they're the only ones that will fight.
[00:43:58.237 --> 00:43:59.257]  We've got to take out Assad.
[00:44:01.178 --> 00:44:08.281]  And now we're told they're going to shoot down airliners, they're going to bomb us, they're going to start chopping heads, and the border is wide open.
[00:44:11.383 --> 00:44:17.045]  There's the headline, CFR Strategist Praises Al-Qaeda Bombings in Syria.
[00:44:17.485 --> 00:44:25.809]  2012, Paul Joseph Watson, and then links to Foreign Affairs in the article, where you can read it for yourself.
[00:44:28.271 --> 00:44:28.871]  Look at this quote.
[00:44:29.391 --> 00:44:33.453]  The Syrian rebels would be immensely weaker today without Al Qaeda in their ranks.
[00:44:34.233 --> 00:44:41.655]  By and large, Free Syrian Army battalions are tired, divided, chaotic and ineffective.
[00:44:42.275 --> 00:44:50.098]  Feeling abandoned by the West, rebel forces are increasingly demoralized as they square off with the Assad regime's superior weaponry and professional army.
[00:44:52.082 --> 00:44:54.664]  Writes the Senior Fellow of the Middle East Studies in the CFR.
[00:44:55.044 --> 00:44:59.267]  And they go on to say, Al Qaeda fighters, however, may help improve morale.
[00:44:59.567 --> 00:45:06.091]  And then it goes in to say, the influx of jihadis brings discipline, religious fervor, battle experience from Iraq.
[00:45:06.151 --> 00:45:07.112]  Yeah, killing our troops.
[00:45:07.833 --> 00:45:09.714]  Think of the sickening, Machiavellian statement.
[00:45:10.154 --> 00:45:16.298]  Funding from Sunni sympathizers in the Gulf, Saudi Arabia, and most importantly, deadly results.
[00:45:16.358 --> 00:45:20.221]  In short, the FSA needs Al Qaeda now, he adds.
[00:45:20.701 --> 00:45:21.822]  Good job pulling that up, Groot.
[00:45:23.603 --> 00:45:27.285]  Remember, listeners, I say something, you can search it, and you can find it.
[00:45:27.305 --> 00:45:29.267]  I'm not making Jack squat up here.
[00:45:29.287 --> 00:45:33.389]  Does that mean I don't get stuff wrong occasionally or flip dates around?
[00:45:33.409 --> 00:45:33.950]  No, I do.
[00:45:35.831 --> 00:45:42.195]  And I got a whole team of people in there watching what I say, and they go, hey, he didn't get killed, he shot him.
[00:45:42.655 --> 00:45:45.036]  He shot the head chopper, the CEO did.
[00:45:45.077 --> 00:45:46.898]  Oh yeah, thanks for reminding me.
[00:45:46.998 --> 00:45:48.799]  He wounded the head chopper, he didn't kill him.
[00:45:50.776 --> 00:45:53.037]  Because you try thinking on your feet up here with no teleprompter.
[00:45:53.918 --> 00:45:58.500]  But the point is, that's why this is different radio slash TV than anything else, because we're going off real research here.
[00:45:59.241 --> 00:46:04.663]  And I know I've been spending 45 minutes of the first key hour on this, but this is the big enchilada.
[00:46:07.025 --> 00:46:16.830]  And I've got to say, again, it is libertarians, it is conservatives, it is police and military,
[00:46:18.482 --> 00:46:33.712]  Are the only groups getting any grasp of this right now, and I listen to so-called liberal media, and it is just a defense of Obama, and a defense of what's happening, and a defense of all these wars.
[00:46:34.774 --> 00:46:40.098]  And they're really coming out of the woodwork attacking us right now, saying we're traitors because we don't want to attack.
[00:46:40.598 --> 00:46:43.220]  And they're attacking Rand Paul saying he doesn't want to attack ISIS.
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:45.602]  No, he said if we could bomb ISIS, that'd be great.
[00:46:45.902 --> 00:46:47.983]  But why did we arm them to begin with?
[00:46:48.364 --> 00:46:49.344]  That's the big issue.
[00:46:49.524 --> 00:46:53.167]  And then he's not confident in the attacks Obama is ordering launched.
[00:46:54.528 --> 00:46:57.030]  Because they are as phony as a $3 bill.
[00:46:57.110 --> 00:46:58.671]  You can rest assured of that.
[00:46:59.251 --> 00:47:02.914]  Now, Dr. Russell Blaylock is going to be joining us for a full hour.
[00:47:05.529 --> 00:47:12.659]  To look at Obamacare as we've now been into it fully, phase one fully implemented.
[00:47:14.221 --> 00:47:21.691]  There's phase two and three and I also want to get him on about all the different neurological disorders we're seeing increasing and the rest of it.
[00:47:23.223 --> 00:47:26.205]  And the fact that, in fact guys, I forgot to ask you this.
[00:47:26.225 --> 00:47:38.932]  Will you print me all the news the last week of the paralyzed kids in Syria from the UN shots, the paralyzed kids in Colombia from the UN shots, the paralyzed kids in Pakistan, and a bunch of, oh, and the US, I'm sorry.
[00:47:39.072 --> 00:47:51.279]  It was NBC News admitted that the paralyzed kids and the sick kids and the breathing disorders and the neurological problems are directly connected to the vaccinated children in public schools and now all these new super diseases are
[00:47:52.279 --> 00:47:54.520]  Just spreading sick children everywhere.
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:56.061]  Everybody I know has sick kids right now.
[00:47:56.922 --> 00:47:57.922]  It's like the killing fields.
[00:47:58.003 --> 00:48:06.267]  Once the shots start every winter to get that immune system lowered, they admit the H1N1 shot of five years ago cut one shot, cut your immune system in half.
[00:48:07.708 --> 00:48:10.550]  In half for other flus for the rest of your life.
[00:48:12.191 --> 00:48:14.512]  So.
[00:48:14.532 --> 00:48:16.113]  That's just a major Canadian government study.
[00:48:16.253 --> 00:48:16.654]  I'm sorry.
[00:48:16.674 --> 00:48:17.254]  I know the facts.
[00:48:18.154 --> 00:48:19.956]  But you look that up yourself if you care.
[00:48:20.979 --> 00:48:22.240]  So we're gonna get him on about that.
[00:48:24.661 --> 00:48:25.441]  That's all coming up.
[00:48:29.443 --> 00:48:31.164]  By the way, we did get another shipment of it.
[00:48:31.184 --> 00:48:36.707]  A little bit of it came in last week, and a little bit more came in this week, and then we should get the full amount next week.
[00:48:37.667 --> 00:48:38.468]  DNA Force.
[00:48:40.623 --> 00:48:46.588]  Well, anybody that's seen me in person, but also on television, says, man, you know, you look like hell for years, and what have you been doing?
[00:48:46.608 --> 00:49:06.024]  Well, same amount of exercise, but drinking more water, trying to get a little bit more sunshine, trying to be more positive, but the nascent iodine, X2, the purest form, strongest form out there, period, from a deep earth crystal source, all the rest of it's from seaweed, which isn't bad, you know, it's okay whether it's sea salt or seaweed, because this is the real deal.
[00:49:06.905 --> 00:49:07.105]  The X2,
[00:49:08.226 --> 00:49:25.999]  The super male vitality, the DNA force, proprietarily blended with patented ingredients, just one of which is BioPQQ, is backed by over 175 published clinical studies and given the ingredient with the best science achievement award.
[00:49:26.519 --> 00:49:37.908]  And it's a nutraceutical, so we're actually allowed to say a lot of things on InfoWarsLife.com and have videos up there breaking it down with Dr. Group because this is certified, patented, confirmed.
[00:49:38.823 --> 00:49:39.083]  Okay.
[00:49:40.163 --> 00:49:43.144]  A whole bunch of the ingredients, and I'm not going to even tell you what it's done for me.
[00:49:43.224 --> 00:49:44.865]  Just get a bottle of it, try it.
[00:49:45.705 --> 00:49:50.406]  The only PQQ from the U.S., extremely expensive, and we give you the best price.
[00:49:50.486 --> 00:49:52.046]  Costs us $12,000 a kilo.
[00:49:52.446 --> 00:49:53.307]  That's one ingredient.
[00:49:54.007 --> 00:49:57.888]  Not sold for seven or ten times the price like most outlets.
[00:49:58.368 --> 00:50:01.269]  Yeah, we market up about one and a half times, which is still a good markup.
[00:50:01.289 --> 00:50:05.970]  That's how we fund our operation, but the rest of the industry just, I'm sorry, it's five, six, seven, eight, ten times.
[00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:10.974]  No other formula focused on heart, brain, mitochondrial, cellular health available.
[00:50:11.474 --> 00:50:14.216]  Again, only when we have it in supply because it's so hard to get it is back in supply.
[00:50:14.657 --> 00:50:25.786]  Patented, unavailable anywhere else, but through Infowarslife.com provides superior antioxidant shielding to skin cells, to cells, to the entire body, damaged DNA.
[00:50:26.827 --> 00:50:30.292]  And the shortening of telomeres accelerate the aging process.
[00:50:30.452 --> 00:50:31.734]  Fight back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:32.214 --> 00:50:35.999]  Now, we've all had the lawyers and everybody else look at exactly what we're able to say about it.
[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:39.283]  So just go to InfoWarsLife.com and read about it right there.
[00:50:40.828 --> 00:50:48.454]  This was formulated by my dad, who has a background in biology and developing nutraceuticals into approved drugs.
[00:50:49.015 --> 00:50:49.915]  That's what he's done before.
[00:50:50.656 --> 00:50:51.377]  And Dr. Group.
[00:50:51.657 --> 00:50:56.000]  And when we went to the main suppliers of the ingredients, they're like, wow, this is an amazing product.
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:57.822]  We had to sign a lot of big contracts and stuff.
[00:50:57.842 --> 00:50:58.903]  I mean, this is the real deal.
[00:50:59.323 --> 00:51:00.324]  It's available at Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:51:00.344 --> 00:51:00.644]  DNA Force.
[00:51:00.664 --> 00:51:04.267]  Leading competitors are three to five times more expensive.
[00:51:10.885 --> 00:51:13.447]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[00:51:13.587 --> 00:51:17.590]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[00:51:17.890 --> 00:51:19.131]  SilverLungs.com.
[00:51:19.291 --> 00:51:21.772]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[00:51:21.973 --> 00:51:24.754]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[00:51:24.955 --> 00:51:27.096]  The Silver Lungs Generator allows you to make your own.
[00:51:27.316 --> 00:51:29.057]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[00:51:29.218 --> 00:51:34.561]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[00:51:34.781 --> 00:51:38.464]  See the Silver Lungs Generator and lung delivery system at SilverLungs.com.
[00:51:38.584 --> 00:51:40.085]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[00:51:40.385 --> 00:51:43.408]  You heard the discussions all over the radio.
[00:51:43.608 --> 00:51:45.690]  You couldn't believe what you were hearing.
[00:51:46.111 --> 00:51:47.052]  You trusted them.
[00:51:47.572 --> 00:51:48.753]  You felt betrayed.
[00:51:49.234 --> 00:51:51.376]  Your emotions began to consume you.
[00:51:51.876 --> 00:51:52.897]  Outrage set in.
[00:51:53.278 --> 00:51:54.599]  Then, nothing.
[00:51:54.959 --> 00:51:56.921]  Days turned to weeks and months.
[00:51:57.202 --> 00:51:58.102]  Then, you forgot.
[00:51:58.963 --> 00:51:59.864]  But they haven't.
[00:52:00.064 --> 00:52:03.066]  They're still monitoring your every move.
[00:52:03.367 --> 00:52:04.027]  It's coming.
[00:52:04.107 --> 00:52:05.088]  What's coming?
[00:52:05.128 --> 00:52:07.270]  MonitorBlocketPocket.com.
[00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:09.471]  Or will you forget?
[00:52:10.092 --> 00:52:12.654]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:12.914 --> 00:52:17.798]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:18.038 --> 00:52:25.884]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:26.144 --> 00:52:30.469]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:30.669 --> 00:52:34.514]  By Patriots Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:34.654 --> 00:52:40.380]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:40.621 --> 00:52:40.961]  It is rare
[00:52:40.981 --> 00:52:41.261]  We're good.
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:12.383]  Americans, prepare for financial ruin.
[00:53:12.863 --> 00:53:16.746]  That is what one of the world's richest men, Donald Trump, said just a few weeks ago.
[00:53:17.007 --> 00:53:18.308]  What are you doing to prepare?
[00:53:18.328 --> 00:53:21.691]  The problems that caused the last financial crisis were never fixed.
[00:53:22.191 --> 00:53:23.573]  In fact, they're even worse now.
[00:53:23.733 --> 00:53:25.154]  The total amount of debt in the U.S.
[00:53:25.194 --> 00:53:28.377]  has grown by more than 57% since September 2008.
[00:53:28.737 --> 00:53:31.620]  The too-big-to-fail banks are much larger,
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:40.787]  And the massive derivatives bubble is spiraling so far out of control that the only thing left to do is watch the spectacular crash landing that is inevitably coming.
[00:53:41.107 --> 00:53:49.213]  If you're a baby boomer with retirement funds, it's time you consider exiting the Wall Street casino and start a cash-flowing international business of your own.
[00:53:49.493 --> 00:53:55.698]  There may be ways to preserve your wealth, but history has shown that few things can grow your wealth like having your own business.
[00:53:55.938 --> 00:53:56.879]  The crash is coming.
[00:53:57.159 --> 00:53:59.464]  Take measures now to soften the landing.
[00:53:59.745 --> 00:54:02.490]  Go to babyboomerbackupplan.com or call 888-507-8789.
[00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:04.114]  That's babyboomerbackupplan.com.
[00:54:11.711 --> 00:54:16.833]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:17.513 --> 00:54:19.753]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:20.554 --> 00:54:24.695]  So, they do a bunch of vaccination and a mystery illness sweeps the country.
[00:54:25.215 --> 00:54:28.016]  Even Main Street media admits it's connected to vaccinated children.
[00:54:28.976 --> 00:54:35.878]  Kind of like every year you hear about MMR outbreaks, whooping cough outbreaks, and it's the vaccinated kids that have got it.
[00:54:37.659 --> 00:54:39.320]  I'm not against the science of vaccination.
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:43.003]  I know it can even work, but you can't trust these evil companies to do it.
[00:54:43.363 --> 00:54:47.487]  There's other agendas afoot, and there's always been side effects to even good vaccines.
[00:54:48.488 --> 00:54:55.193]  It came out that in Europe, the elite, you can look this up, gets a quote, clean vaccine, a secret vaccine that the public doesn't get.
[00:54:55.213 --> 00:54:58.155]  Just type in, German government gets clean vaccine.
[00:54:58.756 --> 00:55:00.617]  British government gets secret vaccine.
[00:55:00.997 --> 00:55:05.301]  Chinese leadership gets, communist leadership gets clean vaccine.
[00:55:05.341 --> 00:55:06.662]  You will have mainstream news.
[00:55:08.547 --> 00:55:15.674]  Monsanto doesn't eat GMO in their own factories, in their own laboratories, in their own cafeterias.
[00:55:18.117 --> 00:55:22.021]  That's CBC out of Canada.
[00:55:25.504 --> 00:55:28.167]  All I'm saying is you need to look into what's going on here, folks.
[00:55:30.213 --> 00:55:32.294]  I'm just looking up at the stories on Infowars.com.
[00:55:33.114 --> 00:55:36.455]  Establishment desperate to co-opt populist uprising.
[00:55:37.115 --> 00:55:51.200]  Council on Foreign Relations, same group, two and a half years ago admitting the whole plan for the Middle East with Al Qaeda, like we're idiots, I just read it to you, has a plan to take over America and neutralize Americans trying to get their freedom back.
[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:56.122]  They have a plan to, quote, neutralize, quote, American distemper.
[00:55:57.310 --> 00:56:00.772]  Also, Americans resigned to ground troops in ISIS war.
[00:56:01.192 --> 00:56:03.493]  Yeah, they've got the Republicans now pushing that for the Democrats.
[00:56:04.193 --> 00:56:07.194]  Bilderberg Kissinger wants World Army to fight terrorists.
[00:56:08.315 --> 00:56:10.876]  And then they run the terrorists, so they need to have a world government.
[00:56:11.016 --> 00:56:14.377]  Oh, you need a world government with NATO to fight the people NATO armed.
[00:56:14.397 --> 00:56:15.918]  2 plus 2 equals what?
[00:56:17.339 --> 00:56:18.119]  Turn the table!
[00:56:18.219 --> 00:56:19.820]  Stopping Western aggression in Syria.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:22.081]  Excellent article by Tony Cartolucci.
[00:56:22.361 --> 00:56:24.682]  But it's not really Western aggression, it's globalists controlling us.
[00:56:25.609 --> 00:56:28.531]  David Cameron says questioning government policy is terrorism.
[00:56:28.891 --> 00:56:29.932]  There's actual video of it.
[00:56:30.572 --> 00:56:36.756]  ISIS just one mile from Baghdad as Al Qaeda fighters joined forces against Syrian airstrikes.
[00:56:37.317 --> 00:56:39.558]  They didn't join forces, they are Al Qaeda!
[00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:48.604]  So that's just some of the news up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:56:49.024 --> 00:56:54.008]  And let's look more at Alton Nolan, the reported beheader.
[00:56:55.544 --> 00:57:03.107]  Who went into the HR area and made a beeline for two white women, killing one, wounding the other, and it's a racial attack!
[00:57:03.928 --> 00:57:05.648]  Meanwhile, Obama gave another speech.
[00:57:06.489 --> 00:57:07.169]  We have the video.
[00:57:08.490 --> 00:57:09.290]  Play it next hour.
[00:57:09.350 --> 00:57:10.430]  We have time with Blaylock.
[00:57:11.331 --> 00:57:14.652]  Saying that basically everyone knows America is racist.
[00:57:16.333 --> 00:57:20.735]  Well, Alton Nolan said, quote, Sharia law is coming.
[00:57:22.193 --> 00:57:31.099]  Until six months ago, when he became a Muslim, he was into being kind of a Mac Daddy type, you know, the godfather, all this gangster type stuff and football.
[00:57:31.419 --> 00:57:38.403]  But see, it was even more gangster and scary to be an OG with, I guess, ISIS.
[00:57:39.084 --> 00:57:41.445]  So this is more like a lone wolf camp follower.
[00:57:42.706 --> 00:57:46.729]  And I expect to see more of this type of business, the way the media hypes it, as cool as it is online.
[00:57:47.709 --> 00:57:50.390]  I'm the first person months ago to say I'm seeing a cool trend.
[00:57:51.050 --> 00:57:55.692]  I'm seeing this ISIS garbage really being pushed as cool.
[00:57:56.112 --> 00:58:01.295]  They had all these Afghan fighters and stuff on his website and shows him at all these mosques hanging out with the Imams.
[00:58:04.776 --> 00:58:10.358]  Pretty disgusting, ladies and gentlemen, to see this happening.
[00:58:11.439 --> 00:58:16.861]  And of course the media is not saying it's racial and they're not saying it's Islamic.
[00:58:18.382 --> 00:58:21.785]  And here's Obama, quote, most Americans think nation is racist.
[00:58:22.365 --> 00:58:26.189]  And he went on to say that black males, you know, don't trust the police.
[00:58:26.269 --> 00:58:26.989]  Well, here's the issue.
[00:58:27.369 --> 00:58:31.593]  I don't trust a lot of stuff that goes on with the police because historically there can be real corruption problems.
[00:58:31.973 --> 00:58:36.617]  But what about a nightclub that got shot up in Miami?
[00:58:37.698 --> 00:58:42.042]  And what about a cop shot in Ferguson over the weekend?
[00:58:44.372 --> 00:58:52.182]  See, I don't like the out-of-control police culture, but I don't like the gangbanger culture, so let's own up to what's going on here.
[00:58:52.202 --> 00:58:57.828]  The MTV and the media all pushes this stuff because it's good for a clash of civilizations.
[00:58:58.409 --> 00:58:58.810]  We'll be back.
[00:59:00.618 --> 00:59:01.639]  DNA Force.
[00:59:01.699 --> 00:59:04.921]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:59:04.961 --> 00:59:06.002]  DNA Force.
[00:59:06.122 --> 00:59:14.128]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:14.289 --> 00:59:19.332]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:59:19.373 --> 00:59:20.353]  DNA Force.
[00:59:20.413 --> 00:59:22.255]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:59:30.681 --> 00:59:34.203]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:59:34.343 --> 00:59:38.305]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:59:38.625 --> 00:59:40.086]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:59:40.406 --> 00:59:47.990]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:59:48.270 --> 00:59:49.110]  But for how long?

[01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:05.495]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:05.956 --> 01:00:08.683]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:17.311]  Big Brother.
[01:00:17.971 --> 01:00:19.012]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:19.752 --> 01:00:20.853]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:21.514 --> 01:00:22.314]  You want answers?
[01:00:23.095 --> 01:00:23.976]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:24.636 --> 01:00:28.239]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:28.839 --> 01:00:32.942]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:41.029 --> 01:00:42.450]  Coming up in the next segment,
[01:00:46.392 --> 01:00:49.235]  Vaccine mix-up in Syria, not uncommon in the U.S.
[01:00:49.595 --> 01:00:54.080]  Forbes, why the vaccine mix-up killed a bunch of kids, but it's no big deal.
[01:00:57.063 --> 01:01:03.429]  And you've got the enterovirus, D-6-8, what is the mystery repertory virus making U.S.
[01:01:03.469 --> 01:01:07.353]  children sick, and why is it directly connected to the vaccination program?
[01:01:09.775 --> 01:01:11.536]  Virus hitting the USB at the tip of the iceberg.
[01:01:11.936 --> 01:01:16.299]  CDC official says, I watched three of my family members die.
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.742]  Late last year, December into January.
[01:01:21.762 --> 01:01:22.823]  My uncle died in January.
[01:01:24.124 --> 01:01:26.125]  My cousin and my great-uncle, a month before that.
[01:01:27.446 --> 01:01:28.686]  And they all lived by each other.
[01:01:31.348 --> 01:01:35.911]  And we're not sure my great-uncle, we know he died of a respiratory thing, but it was clear it was the same thing to my uncle.
[01:01:37.372 --> 01:01:40.938]  And that's why I told you, it took me a month to kick it.
[01:01:40.958 --> 01:01:42.701]  It took my dad a month to kick it.
[01:01:43.282 --> 01:01:49.132]  It was only guzzling bottles of, for me personally, ploytle silver that finally knocked it out.
[01:01:49.172 --> 01:01:49.894]  Antibiotics wouldn't.
[01:01:52.748 --> 01:01:54.269]  And desperate times mean desperate measures.
[01:01:54.329 --> 01:01:55.169]  I'm not a medical doctor.
[01:01:55.189 --> 01:01:56.109]  I'm not telling you what to do.
[01:01:57.010 --> 01:02:04.612]  It's just that I feel in my gut that this year is going to be a whopper because I've already seen the drug-resistant bugs build to a certain point.
[01:02:04.952 --> 01:02:06.813]  I've already seen... It's not even my gut.
[01:02:06.913 --> 01:02:12.875]  I sit around, I look at the news, I look at the numbers all day, and even though they're not really reporting that a crisis is forming, you can see it.
[01:02:13.195 --> 01:02:17.537]  And then now they're saying, oh yeah, get ready for superbugs, superviruses, superbacteria.
[01:02:18.157 --> 01:02:20.958]  You know, this winter is going to be a Mac Daddy.
[01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:31.683]  And now we have people getting paralyzed who have been exposed to the enterovirus.
[01:02:31.983 --> 01:02:33.504]  Guys, print me the headline from last week.
[01:02:33.564 --> 01:02:35.204]  I forget what publication it was mainstream about.
[01:02:35.224 --> 01:02:36.225]  I think it was NBC.
[01:02:36.785 --> 01:02:41.327]  That, um, mystery illness linked to vaccinated kids.
[01:02:41.887 --> 01:02:42.708]  That was the one I wanted.
[01:02:42.748 --> 01:02:45.549]  And then the, um, I think you gave it to me.
[01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:51.412]  I want the, um, I want the thing about kids dying and, um,
[01:02:52.972 --> 01:03:00.335]  And collapsing to get the HPV in Columbia, and then other stuff, because I want to just be able to show all those when Blaylock comes on with us.
[01:03:00.355 --> 01:03:00.735]  Thank you.
[01:03:03.516 --> 01:03:05.177]  Some of the other news that's coming up.
[01:03:07.218 --> 01:03:09.979]  Fumbled bid for governor imperils Ohio Democrats.
[01:03:11.059 --> 01:03:15.641]  All over the country, Democrats are losing because people are revolting against them.
[01:03:17.691 --> 01:03:25.094]  The problem is if the Republicans don't deliver on some real reform and not scuttling this country, they're going to run the ship up on the rocks fully.
[01:03:26.875 --> 01:03:33.918]  And so people will vote for a ham sandwich or a donkey, pun intended,
[01:03:35.174 --> 01:03:40.635]  Before they will vote for a Democrat right now, because people understand they have been mightily betrayed.
[01:03:40.655 --> 01:03:42.536]  And people say, well, that's just how politics is.
[01:03:42.576 --> 01:03:43.916]  Yeah, but it's getting more severe.
[01:03:43.956 --> 01:03:45.356]  It's getting more extreme.
[01:03:45.396 --> 01:03:49.857]  I mean, Obamacare is a doozy of a whopper on steroids.
[01:03:50.678 --> 01:04:02.580]  It's bold with the death list and the death panels and the rationing of care and the 20 plus taxes and the payroll taxes.
[01:04:02.661 --> 01:04:04.561]  I mean, it is cold blooded.
[01:04:08.726 --> 01:04:12.651]  So, all over the country they're in trouble.
[01:04:15.876 --> 01:04:17.258]  All over the country they're in trouble.
[01:04:18.399 --> 01:04:25.249]  And so it looks like the Republicans are going to take the Senate as well, not just the House.
[01:04:27.324 --> 01:04:31.808]  And the message to Congress is, please don't stop this, or please do this, or please vote for that.
[01:04:31.848 --> 01:04:33.649]  Say, we know about the globalist takeover.
[01:04:34.030 --> 01:04:35.251]  We know the country's corrupt.
[01:04:35.631 --> 01:04:36.932]  We know they're devaluing the dollar.
[01:04:37.252 --> 01:04:39.614]  We know special interests are trying to blackmail you or threaten you.
[01:04:40.035 --> 01:04:42.356]  Just do the right thing together, or the whole country's wrecked.
[01:04:42.376 --> 01:04:43.457]  They're going to bring the whole thing down.
[01:04:43.477 --> 01:04:46.980]  I mean, now this isn't even about being goody two-shoes anymore.
[01:04:47.581 --> 01:04:48.381]  We're far past that.
[01:04:48.421 --> 01:04:52.105]  This is about, do you really want to wreck the golden goose?
[01:04:53.083 --> 01:04:58.629]  Because let me tell you, this isn't good for business, except for a few mega-banks that want to buy this country over the pace of a dollar.
[01:04:59.190 --> 01:05:01.913]  This global depression they're bringing in is bad news.
[01:05:02.373 --> 01:05:06.458]  But if we point out the globalists who are behind it, they may back down and do a soft landing.
[01:05:06.878 --> 01:05:08.901]  They're only going to pull this off if they can get away with it.

[01:06:12.561 --> 01:06:15.525]  It's time to give your eyes a powerful nutritional boost.
[01:06:15.966 --> 01:06:22.134]  Sight is the primary input to the brain, arguably making eyesight the most important sense we have.
[01:06:22.474 --> 01:06:25.879]  And just like the other important organs in our bodies, our eyes
[01:06:25.879 --> 01:06:30.420]  Eyes function at peak levels when they are fed the proper amounts of essential nutrition.
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:31.901]  Open your eyes!

[01:07:01.996 --> 01:07:02.757]  Open your eyes.
[01:07:10.168 --> 01:07:17.210]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:07:17.310 --> 01:07:19.471]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:07:19.671 --> 01:07:24.772]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:07:24.932 --> 01:07:29.874]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:07:30.114 --> 01:07:33.155]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:07:33.435 --> 01:07:37.276]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:07:37.496 --> 01:07:41.737]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:07:41.817 --> 01:07:51.860]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:54.561]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:07:54.761 --> 01:08:02.833]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[01:08:23.248 --> 01:08:24.109]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:24.790 --> 01:08:28.413]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:28.973 --> 01:08:33.057]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:43.803 --> 01:08:50.107]  You're either with us, or you're with the terrorists, George W. Bush famously said after 9-11 at the UN.
[01:08:51.488 --> 01:09:01.155]  Well, our government has publicly, along with NATO and others, armed al-Qaeda, renaming it ISIL-ISIS, it has new names every few weeks, and is turning them loose across the planet.
[01:09:01.595 --> 01:09:11.702]  Former Congressman Ron Paul is going to be joining us tomorrow for 30 minutes with his take on that, his son running for president, and a lot more, and former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura.
[01:09:12.588 --> 01:09:14.929]  We'll also be joining us tomorrow.
[01:09:15.509 --> 01:09:17.990]  They're both on the second and third hours.
[01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:20.390]  We're now in to the second hour today.
[01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:22.431]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:09:23.291 --> 01:09:26.732]  Now, one of my favorite guests is Dr. Russell Blaylock.
[01:09:27.613 --> 01:09:34.815]  And of course, he's a retired brain surgeon, a well-known famous brain surgeon who developed some of the most widely used techniques out there today.
[01:09:36.045 --> 01:09:44.112]  And he has basically in the last 30 years introduced many of the terms that are now in mainline medical journals, like excitotoxins and issues like that.
[01:09:44.913 --> 01:09:53.680]  And he has been vindicated on the dangers of aspartame, mercury in the vaccines, thimerosal.
[01:09:54.901 --> 01:09:56.503]  He's been vindicated over and over again.
[01:09:56.563 --> 01:10:01.227]  In the last month we've seen not one but two, not one but two,
[01:10:03.106 --> 01:10:05.488]  High-level FDA whistleblowers come out.
[01:10:06.008 --> 01:10:13.913]  One of them was one of the scientists that was one of the two main authors of a big study that came out five years ago, six years ago.
[01:10:14.714 --> 01:10:16.395]  And then another one that came out in 2004.
[01:10:16.435 --> 01:10:21.478]  Now the one in 2004 was the one that said mercury is actually good for your children's brains.
[01:10:22.099 --> 01:10:24.620]  And I'm going to play that clip from CBS News from 2004.
[01:10:25.061 --> 01:10:32.846]  And he said that they were basically ordered to omit the evidence showing a tripling in autism in boys.
[01:10:34.707 --> 01:10:41.873]  So, how did Monsanto, with the Searle research, say that monkeys, you know, that were fed in their milk aspartame was fine?
[01:10:42.113 --> 01:10:47.237]  They just omitted all the dead or brain-damaged monkeys and then only kept the ones that were okay and said, oh look, it's fine.
[01:10:47.417 --> 01:10:50.500]  Doesn't matter if 73% of the monkeys died or became brain-damaged.
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:51.901]  They just omitted them from the study.
[01:10:53.002 --> 01:10:53.922]  That's been in Congress.
[01:10:54.943 --> 01:10:56.484]  So, and where I learned about that?
[01:10:56.544 --> 01:10:59.447]  From Dr. Blalock, gotta be 15 years ago on the show.
[01:11:00.655 --> 01:11:04.137]  Of all the guests, he has been the most trailblazing.
[01:11:04.157 --> 01:11:17.165]  I know he hasn't come on to have his butt kissed, but I mean, we need to recognize people that have been demonized on national television, the Associated Press, you name it, when he said the H1N1 was a fraud, it would lower your immune system a year later.
[01:11:17.545 --> 01:11:22.508]  The head of the EU Commission, Dr. Wolfgang Wudarg, came out and confirmed it all.
[01:11:23.128 --> 01:11:24.629]  He has been triple vindicated.
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:50.099]  in everything he said and so I want to just cover the waterfront from the articles he wrote on his BlaylockWellnessCenter.com the articles he wrote from Newsmax.com everything I mean it's just so accurate his research that literally I just he's a national treasure now you know I don't gush like that with most our guests it's just that I've been on the air 20 years I'm interviewing this guy since 1998 or so so I guess about 16 years and
[01:11:54.904 --> 01:12:03.070]  We wouldn't be where we are, having most Americans now aware of what's going on, vaccine levels going way down, people realizing they're dangerous.
[01:12:03.090 --> 01:12:06.972]  We're not against vaccines, it's just that it's what's in them and they've got liability protection.
[01:12:07.513 --> 01:12:08.794]  We've got to clean up their act.
[01:12:09.674 --> 01:12:11.035]  And at least that's my view.
[01:12:11.275 --> 01:12:16.759]  He has a new super awesome website and a podcast, BlaylockHealthChannel.com.
[01:12:16.799 --> 01:12:18.340]  BlaylockHealthChannel.com.
[01:12:19.321 --> 01:12:20.121]  What a resource!
[01:12:20.161 --> 01:12:20.982]  Send that out to everybody.
[01:12:21.302 --> 01:12:22.702]  We're going to tweet it at Real Alex Jones.
[01:12:22.722 --> 01:12:23.943]  We're going to post it to Facebook.
[01:12:24.423 --> 01:12:36.547]  Get that out to everybody, because every child we warn, every parent we warn, they won't listen to somebody like me half the time, or they won't even listen to Ron Paul, or they can fire Hollywood stars that come out.
[01:12:37.387 --> 01:12:40.568]  And criticize vaccines to try to shut everybody up.
[01:12:40.628 --> 01:12:46.030]  But they'll listen to a medical doctor, a brain surgeon, like Dr. Russell Blaylock.
[01:12:46.050 --> 01:12:47.670]  So he's with us for the balance of the hour.
[01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:50.931]  And then we're going to have open phones in the third hour today.
[01:12:50.971 --> 01:12:52.451]  But we're going to cover it all.
[01:12:52.551 --> 01:12:59.553]  Obamacare, the vaccines, this new mystery virus that even CBS and NBC admit is linked to the vaccines.
[01:13:00.013 --> 01:13:01.434]  Four articles the last two weeks.
[01:13:01.994 --> 01:13:05.435]  In three continents, people getting paralyzed or dying from U.N.
[01:13:05.455 --> 01:13:10.236]  vaccine programs, MMR, polio, and Gardasil.
[01:13:11.596 --> 01:13:13.577]  It's just crazy what's happening.
[01:13:14.197 --> 01:13:16.418]  Dr. Blaylock, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:13:16.618 --> 01:13:17.418]  Well, thank you, Allen.
[01:13:18.178 --> 01:13:18.998]  Where do you want to start?
[01:13:20.619 --> 01:13:23.939]  Well, we can start with this enterovirus, D68.
[01:13:27.611 --> 01:13:42.821]  You know, what most people don't know, and a lot of physicians don't know, is that the enteroviruses, which is a group of viruses that normally inhabit the intestine, most of them are pretty benign.
[01:13:42.861 --> 01:13:47.124]  They're just called a mild fever, a little ache, and a few days later you're well.
[01:13:48.245 --> 01:13:51.407]  When I was growing up, in fact, we called it a summer virus.
[01:13:53.188 --> 01:13:55.049]  So these are very common viruses.
[01:13:55.109 --> 01:13:57.271]  Now, what changed to produce the
[01:13:58.012 --> 01:14:06.516]  The epidemic of polio back in the 30s, 40s, and 50s was not a change in the virus.
[01:14:06.616 --> 01:14:10.818]  It was a change in the host, that is, people's, people's immune system.
[01:14:12.018 --> 01:14:24.664]  And analysis of it now by independent scientists, not the politically controlled scientists, but independent scientists, shows that something happened to people's immunity.
[01:14:25.547 --> 01:14:35.976]  And about the time that polio started paralyzing so many children, they were doing widespread inoculations for diphtheria and pertussis.
[01:14:37.777 --> 01:14:45.864]  And there's evidence now that that alters the immune system so that it produces a different disease, and that is paralysis.
[01:14:46.924 --> 01:14:55.071]  And, you know, if the virus itself caused paralysis, then everybody that got infected with the polio enterovirus would have been paralyzed.
[01:14:55.646 --> 01:14:56.166]  Well, they weren't.
[01:14:56.526 --> 01:15:03.210]  The vast majority of people who contracted the polio virus had no disease or very mild disease.
[01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:08.052]  Only a small percentage were ever developing any form of paralysis.
[01:15:08.593 --> 01:15:21.299]  By the way, my grandmother, who's 89, you know, just beautiful, wonderful, smart person, she was given the first polio vaccine and then a month later got polio and it ate half the muscle in her body.
[01:15:21.339 --> 01:15:22.200]  But sorry, just go ahead.
[01:15:23.035 --> 01:15:35.603]  Yeah, and this is one of the things that was the big scandal at the time was that the vaccine itself eventually was causing virtually all the reported cases of polio, not a wild-type virus.
[01:15:37.224 --> 01:15:49.993]  And one of the big puzzles was that the virus seemed to be affecting the wealthier people, the upper economic class, than
[01:15:50.692 --> 01:15:54.094]  And poor neighborhoods, normally we'd see just the opposite.
[01:15:54.835 --> 01:16:01.099]  And what they discovered was that poor kids get a lot of normal infections and so they have good strong immune systems.
[01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:16.970]  Whereas the wealthier kids were being protected against these diseases by avoiding the infections and getting the vaccines and therefore their immune system was very poor and couldn't react to it.
[01:16:17.888 --> 01:16:31.176]  And this is, we're seeing this magnified many times over now, where there's just an unending push to vaccinate for every known disease, even childhood diseases are quite mild.
[01:16:32.016 --> 01:16:35.118]  You know, when I grew up, everybody got measles, mumps, chicken pox.
[01:16:36.919 --> 01:16:38.820]  All of these things were very common.
[01:16:40.341 --> 01:16:42.843]  And that built our immune systems up.
[01:16:42.903 --> 01:16:46.905]  So as we became adults, we're more resistant to things like flu and
[01:16:47.782 --> 01:16:51.023]  And so, you know, I've never had a flu shot in my life.
[01:16:51.043 --> 01:16:52.884]  I've never had a serious case of flu.
[01:16:54.684 --> 01:17:11.270]  But we've weakened everybody's immune system so severely now from all of these things, poor diet, things that we know suppress immunity, like the vaccines, the way they're given, that now people can't react.
[01:17:11.350 --> 01:17:14.771]  And what people don't know about vaccines, and most doctors don't know,
[01:17:15.981 --> 01:17:26.899]  But it's well demonstrated in medical literature that the vaccines shift your immune system to an immune suppression type state called a Th2 shift.
[01:17:27.543 --> 01:17:43.109]  And you said that during the H1N1 scare and then six months later the Canadian government came out with two studies and said that it cut your immune system by as much or more than 50% to take that vaccine.
[01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:46.231]  So you, how did you know that at the time?
[01:17:46.251 --> 01:17:48.192]  I guess just because it had already been done before.
[01:17:48.212 --> 01:17:48.832]  I mean you already knew.
[01:17:49.312 --> 01:17:59.577]  Well, the research has shown that that's what most vaccines do, is they shift your immune system to a weaker antiviral type immune system.
[01:18:00.217 --> 01:18:18.426]  Well, we know, for instance, if we switch over to the Ebola incident in Africa, well, what they don't tell the general public is that Africans almost all have parasitic infections, malaria, roundworms in their intestines.
[01:18:19.284 --> 01:18:32.228]  And that it has been shown by multiple studies, and several recent have come out in Nature Magazine and Science, that this powerfully suppresses their cellular immunity, their ability to fight viruses.
[01:18:33.608 --> 01:18:41.071]  The Ebola virus itself invades the white blood cells that fight viruses and weakens the immune system further.
[01:18:42.031 --> 01:18:44.872]  So, they're at a particularly vulnerable state.
[01:18:45.572 --> 01:18:48.653]  It's not that the virus is such a vicious killer,
[01:18:49.369 --> 01:18:53.032]  It's that the people that it's infecting have this immune suppression.
[01:18:54.333 --> 01:19:14.647]  Well, if you're taking the United States and injecting people with so many vaccines that you're keeping them in a constant state, just like the Africans, that now you're switching everybody to this Th2 immune suppression, then everybody in the United States becomes more susceptible as well.
[01:19:16.483 --> 01:19:18.384]  And no one's talking about that.
[01:19:18.464 --> 01:19:24.006]  Now, a lot of scientists know that, but they're afraid to speak out because their careers would be ruined.
[01:19:24.266 --> 01:19:25.607]  Well, that's what I was about to throw out.
[01:19:26.067 --> 01:19:36.611]  Look at how they get comedians fired from state farm commercials just because in their private life they say, man, something's going on with these vaccines or America's becoming fascist.
[01:19:36.671 --> 01:19:39.092]  But you know this in the literature.
[01:19:39.112 --> 01:19:40.432]  Other medical doctors know it.
[01:19:40.472 --> 01:19:44.534]  My dad's an oral surgeon and a chemist, but he told me this stuff when I was a kid.
[01:19:45.394 --> 01:19:45.794]  I don't know.
[01:20:03.466 --> 01:20:11.129]  Because I'm a good doctor, and I'm Harvard-educated, and you don't tell me I'm wrong, and that's a bunch of quackery.
[01:20:11.410 --> 01:20:14.671]  But then I go read all the mainline studies, the inserts.
[01:20:15.191 --> 01:20:17.732]  You are really covering what's mainline science.
[01:20:18.052 --> 01:20:30.698]  How can there be a disconnect between a Harvard-educated pediatrician and then a brain surgeon like yourself when all you're doing is covering the body of the most scientific, respected literature?
[01:20:31.755 --> 01:20:36.297]  Well, the problem is that most physicians don't read scientific literature.
[01:20:36.477 --> 01:20:41.760]  They read clinical studies, and they read it in only a handful of journals.
[01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:47.042]  For instance, pediatricians read their journal and a couple of other journals, but that's it.
[01:20:47.282 --> 01:20:54.266]  So, most of their information they're getting from the vaccine manufacturers, they're getting from their pediatric
[01:20:55.630 --> 01:20:57.872]  Uh, what I call a trade union.
[01:20:57.892 --> 01:21:02.076]  Uh, and so they're not getting scientific information.
[01:21:02.116 --> 01:21:03.337]  They're getting propaganda.
[01:21:03.357 --> 01:21:09.962]  Sure, I mean, in the journal, you got a Gardasil ad, you got two or three other ads, and then right next to it, an article about how great Gardasil is.
[01:21:10.022 --> 01:21:11.223]  I mean, this is not rocket science.
[01:21:11.403 --> 01:21:18.449]  Well, and the thing is, you see, what I do is I spend a lot of time delving deep into mechanisms by which all this occurred.
[01:21:19.409 --> 01:21:24.994]  And I just finished a couple weeks ago lecturing to a group of pediatricians.
[01:21:25.643 --> 01:21:27.324]  Teaching them this mechanism.
[01:21:28.425 --> 01:21:33.888]  And in the audience were a number of scientists who do excellent science, and they agreed.
[01:21:34.549 --> 01:21:38.011]  They said, you know, the mechanism you're describing is right on target.
[01:21:38.903 --> 01:22:05.907]  Well, when you hear these doctors who get up and say it's completely safe and there's no mechanism by which you could cause it, they don't know what they're talking about because there is a very firm, well-demonstrated scientific method by which these vaccines are causing brain damage, prolonged brain inflammation, and excitotoxicity in the brain that goes on for decades, possibly a lifetime.
[01:22:06.984 --> 01:22:14.989]  That has the potential of increasing a number of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS.
[01:22:15.710 --> 01:22:25.595]  And what shocked me is I cannot believe since my career, and it goes back a good ways, I have never seen so much neurological disease in people.
[01:22:26.476 --> 01:22:30.939]  We're just seeing an explosion of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and ALS.
[01:22:30.979 --> 01:22:35.982]  You know, when I was a resident, we had to look around hard to find a case of ALS.
[01:22:37.115 --> 01:22:38.756]  Now they're everywhere.
[01:22:39.176 --> 01:22:43.258]  Everybody knows somebody that has a friend or a relative that has ALS.
[01:22:43.678 --> 01:22:45.098]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:22:45.819 --> 01:22:54.282]  And yet the medical profession, I'm talking about the clinical practicing doctor, he's totally clueless as to the mechanism by which you can produce this.
[01:22:55.074 --> 01:23:15.460]  Yet in experimental animals, we can produce all of these neurological diseases by stimulating the immune system in ways that resemble vaccination, particularly that sequential excessive vaccination will produce this progressive neurodegeneration, just like we're seeing clinically.
[01:23:16.007 --> 01:23:21.508]  Well, I worked for a large animal vet off and on for three years, and this was 25 years ago.
[01:23:22.609 --> 01:23:29.891]  And back then, one day a week at his clinic, he would take dogs and cats out in the country.
[01:23:30.551 --> 01:23:33.371]  And people would come in and he'd say, you don't need a shot every year.
[01:23:33.391 --> 01:23:35.052]  You know, they need them every three years max.
[01:23:35.732 --> 01:23:38.234]  Some of these vaccines work 10 years on a dog or a cat.
[01:23:38.594 --> 01:23:40.136]  And they'd say, but I'm supposed to get it every year.
[01:23:40.156 --> 01:23:41.396]  And he'd say, no, you don't need that.
[01:23:41.817 --> 01:23:44.719]  And then he would explain to me, we see him have convulsions.
[01:23:45.119 --> 01:23:46.701]  We see him have autoimmune disorders.
[01:23:46.761 --> 01:23:50.103]  We see their allergies, especially in purebreds.
[01:23:51.184 --> 01:23:55.688]  And then now, of course, in the last decade, vets lobbied to get it to every three years.
[01:23:56.028 --> 01:24:02.213]  Now the vaccine companies are pushing back through the veterinary associations to make it at the state level, mandated every year.
[01:24:03.254 --> 01:24:19.755]  Yeah, I hear from a lot of veterinary experts who tell me that they're seeing a terrible deterioration of the dogs and the cats from these vaccinations.
[01:24:20.770 --> 01:24:25.012]  Because just like humans, every time they think of a new vaccine, they give it to them.
[01:24:25.773 --> 01:24:29.415]  And they're seeing this terrible deterioration.
[01:24:29.995 --> 01:24:32.456]  And it's the same sort of disorders we're seeing in humans.
[01:24:32.496 --> 01:24:34.618]  We're seeing brain degeneration.
[01:24:34.658 --> 01:24:38.359]  We're seeing an explosion of autoimmune diseases in the animals.
[01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:40.721]  Well, that's exactly what we're seeing in humans.
[01:24:40.801 --> 01:24:44.223]  We're seeing an explosion of autoimmune diseases of every kind.
[01:24:44.783 --> 01:24:46.804]  They're occurring at early ages.
[01:24:46.824 --> 01:24:48.485]  We're seeing increased MS.
[01:24:49.808 --> 01:24:50.750]  I think so.
[01:25:06.602 --> 01:25:15.971]  And yet, the intimidation by the pharmaceutical companies and the government and link with pharmaceutical companies, scientists are terrified to speak out.
[01:25:16.111 --> 01:25:30.604]  And what they did to Andrew Wakefield is one of the reasons that doctors are so terrified to open their mouth and say, hey look, millions of people are having their lives destroyed and their health destroyed.
[01:25:31.284 --> 01:25:33.485]  By this crazy vaccine policy.
[01:25:33.585 --> 01:25:35.386]  I mean, we're not even reasonable now.
[01:25:35.827 --> 01:25:39.088]  They're wanting to give 150 vaccines over a lifetime.
[01:25:39.969 --> 01:25:44.411]  Well, you can't do that to an animal and not destroy the animal's health.
[01:25:45.672 --> 01:25:48.233]  And you can't do it to a child or a human being.
[01:25:48.434 --> 01:25:53.757]  A child gets about almost 40 different vaccines by the time they start school.
[01:25:54.417 --> 01:25:57.699]  Well now, after they're in school, they want them to get even more vaccines.
[01:25:57.759 --> 01:25:59.960]  And when they go to college, they want more vaccines.
[01:26:00.732 --> 01:26:05.954]  Uh, if they ain't going to the medical profession, they say you can't enter a hospital unless you get a flu shot every year.
[01:26:06.054 --> 01:26:07.875]  Isn't this the heart of tyranny?
[01:26:07.935 --> 01:26:12.537]  Because if you talk to the brain surgeons, the medical doctors, the vets, they'll all tell you the same thing.
[01:26:13.217 --> 01:26:16.458]  The inserts on a lot of the vaccines admit it doesn't even protect you.
[01:26:16.958 --> 01:26:18.399]  More studies out that, uh...
[01:26:18.939 --> 01:26:20.759]  Hepatitis vaccines attack the liver.
[01:26:20.819 --> 01:26:22.080]  Why are we giving newborn babies?
[01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:27.661]  Getting to the heart of this, Dr. Blaylock, they've had decades now to know this is going on.
[01:26:27.701 --> 01:26:28.841]  Instead, they're ramping it up.
[01:26:29.162 --> 01:26:33.503]  Until six years ago, no medical doctor I talked to would ever vaccinate a pregnant woman.
[01:26:33.863 --> 01:26:36.583]  So they doubled down and said, pregnant women need extra.
[01:26:37.884 --> 01:26:46.086]  So instead of admitting that they've been caught in this eugenics policy, is what I believe it really is, and you've documented that as well,
[01:26:47.358 --> 01:26:49.400]  Instead, they seem to be doubling down.
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:51.801]  What's at the bottom of this rabbit hole?
[01:26:51.902 --> 01:26:53.743]  What is the vaccine agenda really about?
[01:26:54.584 --> 01:27:17.101]  Well, before I answer that, I think, without question, the vaccinating of pregnant women, which they say they should be vaccinated during any stage of their pregnancy, is the most absolute, insane, anti-scientific, unsupportable idea anyone could have come up with.
[01:27:17.722 --> 01:27:33.286]  Now, we have overwhelming evidence that immune stimulation during pregnancy increases the risk of that child being born with later developing autism or schizophrenia about six-fold or seven-fold higher.
[01:27:34.306 --> 01:27:35.126]  Now, we know that.
[01:27:35.287 --> 01:27:37.027]  We know miscarriages are increased.
[01:27:37.868 --> 01:27:43.652]  Uh, yet they're carrying out this insane policy of telling every woman to get a vaccine.
[01:27:43.712 --> 01:27:59.123]  Now, the reason they're doing that is because they can't even interpret the scientific studies, which found that if women develop the flu or develop an infection, a serious infection during pregnancy, it increases the risk of autism and schizophrenia in the baby.
[01:27:59.790 --> 01:28:05.620]  But the studies found it's not the virus, it's the immune reaction that causes it.
[01:28:05.721 --> 01:28:06.522]  It's interleukin 6.
[01:28:07.644 --> 01:28:12.192]  And that you can produce it without a virus just by stimulating the immune system.
[01:28:12.842 --> 01:28:25.745]  Well, a woman's risk of getting a serious infection during her pregnancy is pretty small, but they're calling for stimulating the immune system of every pregnant woman in the United States.
[01:28:25.765 --> 01:28:26.245]  Unbelievable.
[01:28:26.305 --> 01:28:27.405]  How insane is that?
[01:28:27.805 --> 01:28:29.726]  I just can't believe it.
[01:28:29.826 --> 01:28:39.088]  The doctors that know this, the scientists that know this, will just sit by and let them destroy the lives of millions of unborn babies.
[01:28:39.908 --> 01:28:47.916]  Uh, and knowing that the science strongly supports that this is the most insane idea anyone could ever come up with.
[01:28:48.016 --> 01:28:50.378]  Number one, the flu vaccine during pregnancy.
[01:28:50.418 --> 01:28:57.525]  The flu vaccine is ineffective for most people and particularly during pregnancy.
[01:28:58.431 --> 01:28:58.971]  Unbelievable.
[01:28:59.031 --> 01:29:04.273]  The neurological disorders, the mental illness, every metric is going parabolic straight up like a rocket and
[01:29:29.397 --> 01:29:34.000]  When we come back, we'll get your answer, because you just set that up with, is it on purpose?
[01:29:34.661 --> 01:29:37.162]  Well, at this point, we know it is because they know.
[01:29:37.182 --> 01:29:41.005]  I mean, every doctor I've talked to goes, yes, it's true.
[01:29:41.125 --> 01:29:42.726]  We know you don't vaccinate pregnant women.
[01:29:42.746 --> 01:29:43.427]  Everybody knew that.
[01:29:43.887 --> 01:29:46.949]  So why do they say in articles I have, women need extra?
[01:29:47.670 --> 01:29:49.911]  I mean, just give a pregnant woman extra.
[01:29:49.951 --> 01:29:50.852]  They just need it.
[01:29:52.136 --> 01:29:53.197]  It's a doubling down.
[01:29:53.257 --> 01:29:54.638]  It's an over-the-top evil.
[01:29:54.718 --> 01:29:55.758]  It's a full commitment.
[01:29:56.879 --> 01:29:58.200]  And it is just devilish.
[01:29:58.220 --> 01:29:59.781]  Dr. Blaylock is our guest.
[01:30:00.021 --> 01:30:00.922]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:01.362 --> 01:30:02.943]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.884 --> 01:30:06.426]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:06.446 --> 01:30:09.788]  BlaylockHealthChannel.com Infowars.com
[01:30:10.891 --> 01:30:12.112]  Another major health threat.
[01:30:12.132 --> 01:30:17.055]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:30:17.115 --> 01:30:19.757]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:30:19.797 --> 01:30:26.562]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:30:26.842 --> 01:30:29.704]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:30:29.824 --> 01:30:32.766]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:30:32.786 --> 01:30:34.768]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:30:34.808 --> 01:30:37.710]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:30:37.790 --> 01:30:43.234]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:30:43.455 --> 01:30:46.938]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:30:46.958 --> 01:30:49.940]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:57.146]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[01:30:57.386 --> 01:31:00.429]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[01:31:10.976 --> 01:31:20.480]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super-oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:30.385]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:31:30.545 --> 01:31:33.466]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[01:31:33.666 --> 01:31:34.287]  I think so.
[01:31:48.643 --> 01:31:48.903]  We're good.
[01:32:11.042 --> 01:32:17.147]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[01:32:17.167 --> 01:32:20.510]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:32:20.610 --> 01:32:22.192]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[01:32:22.252 --> 01:32:28.517]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:32:28.617 --> 01:32:34.502]  Is this another Forks Flight stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[01:32:34.662 --> 01:32:38.425]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:32:38.625 --> 01:32:41.487]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:32:41.507 --> 01:32:49.693]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:32:49.973 --> 01:32:52.015]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:32:52.075 --> 01:32:53.096]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:32:53.476 --> 01:33:02.218]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[01:33:02.418 --> 01:33:04.859]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.
[01:33:05.079 --> 01:33:09.380]  Become a member, share your membership, and help take the info war to the next level.
[01:33:16.621 --> 01:33:22.165]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:22.665 --> 01:33:25.287]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:25.307 --> 01:33:36.636]  We're going to go back to Dr. Blaylock here in a moment and get into Obamacare and other big medical issues that are out there.
[01:33:38.109 --> 01:33:43.874]  BlaylockWellnessCenter.com, Newsmax.com, BlaylockHealthChannel.com, where you'll find this podcast.
[01:33:43.914 --> 01:33:44.915]  It's an excellent website.
[01:33:45.716 --> 01:33:59.408]  And you should be on a mission to send this to school nurses, a mission to send this to their talk show host, a mission to take the YouTube that'll be up by tonight or tomorrow of this live radio slash TV show, and you should send it out to people.
[01:33:59.969 --> 01:34:03.392]  Vaccinating pregnant women is a death sentence in many cases.
[01:34:05.003 --> 01:34:10.044]  Imagine if we were reporting the Nazis would shoot up pregnant women to try to force an abortion.
[01:34:10.584 --> 01:34:19.085]  The UN's been caught adding a hormone synthetically to the tetanus shot to then cause abortions.
[01:34:19.145 --> 01:34:19.766]  You can look that up.
[01:34:19.786 --> 01:34:20.706]  That's mainstream news.
[01:34:20.886 --> 01:34:23.166]  They've been caught in the mid-90s and again last year doing it.
[01:34:24.226 --> 01:34:25.346]  So this is going on.
[01:34:25.366 --> 01:34:27.487]  Remember the Tuskegee syphilis stuff?
[01:34:27.507 --> 01:34:29.707]  Remember all the other tests on troops?
[01:34:29.767 --> 01:34:30.707]  It's still going on.
[01:34:30.827 --> 01:34:34.028]  Why do we trust the people, these eugenicists that run the system?
[01:34:34.810 --> 01:34:40.633]  I'm going to get Dr. Blaylock to get into that and his research and why he thinks this is going on.
[01:34:41.393 --> 01:34:44.595]  Because if we ever admit this is really going on, the whole system will come down.
[01:34:45.655 --> 01:34:49.477]  That's why so many people in the system just rationalize because they've been part of it.
[01:34:49.617 --> 01:34:51.518]  They don't want to admit it through ignorance.
[01:34:52.258 --> 01:34:53.519]  They have aided and abetted.
[01:34:54.707 --> 01:34:56.407]  This scientific dictatorship.
[01:34:57.068 --> 01:34:57.668]  That's my view.
[01:34:57.688 --> 01:34:59.068]  We'll get Dr. Blaylock's view in a moment.
[01:35:00.108 --> 01:35:09.171]  One thing I'm doing because of all the super illnesses, the super bacteria, the MRSA, the flesh-eating garbage, is I'm getting more sun.
[01:35:09.551 --> 01:35:10.791]  I'm drinking purified water.
[01:35:11.171 --> 01:35:12.411]  I'm eating healthier meals.
[01:35:13.572 --> 01:35:13.972]  I am
[01:35:15.072 --> 01:35:27.292]  Taking the true organic vitamins and trace minerals, the true nascent iodine, X2, that we've developed from the deep earth crystal source, not the seaweed source, that is unhealthy and fat as I've gotten.
[01:35:27.452 --> 01:35:29.115]  I mean, everybody can see the difference.
[01:35:29.986 --> 01:35:34.307]  Truly amazing, all the products at Infowarslife.com.
[01:35:34.847 --> 01:35:45.809]  And that's also a win-win, the highest quality trailblazing products developed by top doctors, researchers, nutritionists, pharmacists, you name it, chemists.
[01:35:47.470 --> 01:35:54.611]  It also funds this operation that is a lighthouse in a storm, warning people.
[01:35:55.031 --> 01:35:57.392]  I see a pregnant woman, I start warning her about vaccines.
[01:35:58.444 --> 01:36:00.105]  Not because I'm a hero, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:00.325 --> 01:36:01.986]  I truly am freaked out for that child.
[01:36:02.266 --> 01:36:03.867]  That's a normal behavior.
[01:36:05.668 --> 01:36:12.913]  My uncle, my dad's brother, almost died when he was in a farming accident and got poked and they gave him a tetanus shot, almost killed him.
[01:36:13.813 --> 01:36:16.295]  My mother almost died from a flu shot 15 years ago.
[01:36:17.215 --> 01:36:25.360]  I mean, I can't tell you how many people I know have been killed by vaccines or hurt by them, or how many women are in their second trimester and get a flu shot and have a miscarriage.
[01:36:26.769 --> 01:36:28.571]  And the whole system just kind of covers it up.
[01:36:29.051 --> 01:36:30.293]  This is the corrupting of the system.
[01:36:30.333 --> 01:36:38.741]  So what I do, is I take the survival shield X2, I take the fluoride shield, chelating, detoxifying, it doesn't just go after fluoride, a bunch of other heavy metals and things.
[01:36:39.847 --> 01:36:48.135]  What I do is I take the Super Mill Vitality, that's just simply a bunch of well-known herbs that help boost your whole natural glandular function, your endocrine system.
[01:36:49.035 --> 01:36:55.201]  I take the Occupower, that's concentrated organic compounds known to boost the cells in the eye, but also other cells in the body.
[01:36:55.521 --> 01:37:01.727]  DNA Force, after people clawing at the doors to get it, been sold out for 12 weeks, it's back in.
[01:37:02.227 --> 01:37:05.070]  All available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:37:05.090 --> 01:37:05.851]  The Oxy Powder,
[01:37:06.711 --> 01:37:08.694]  Development Doctor Group to flush out the intestines.
[01:37:08.894 --> 01:37:09.194]  All of it.
[01:37:09.534 --> 01:37:10.636]  Trailblazing Products.
[01:37:10.736 --> 01:37:12.738]  Infowarslife.com or 888.
[01:37:14.922 --> 01:37:15.222]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[01:37:16.463 --> 01:37:19.145]  And with my children, I'm doing the same thing.
[01:37:19.585 --> 01:37:22.367]  Everything I can to boost their immune system.
[01:37:22.787 --> 01:37:26.770]  Infowarslife.com or 888-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[01:37:26.790 --> 01:37:37.037]  And a couple times a day, especially in allergy and cold season, I take the Infowars Lung Cleanse, the concentrated herbs and other ingredients, and take three shots in the mouth.
[01:37:38.358 --> 01:37:41.460]  And then inhale a little bit, just a little bit down into the throat.
[01:37:42.739 --> 01:37:49.743]  True essential oil throat product, not like the others that just have some menthol or something else in it.
[01:37:49.803 --> 01:37:56.266]  This is like Ricola on steroids and it's available at Infowarslife.com as I said.
[01:37:57.167 --> 01:38:03.730]  Dr. Blaylock, I want to play a clip here and get your response to this because I don't like to mention this without playing it because it's so outrageous.
[01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:08.332]  Here's the local version of a national CBS story from 2004.
[01:38:09.173 --> 01:38:10.874]  We now have one of the main authors
[01:38:11.684 --> 01:38:18.338]  uh... of the study admitting they were told to omit the evidence that was actually tripling autism in boys
[01:38:19.423 --> 01:38:21.224]  What a difference 10 years makes.
[01:38:21.644 --> 01:38:24.266]  Here they are 10 years later admitting it was all a lie.
[01:38:24.566 --> 01:38:25.927]  Here's the original report.
[01:38:26.067 --> 01:38:27.968]  Mercury is good for your brain.
[01:38:28.008 --> 01:38:28.368]  Here it is.
[01:38:28.388 --> 01:38:34.452]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[01:38:34.932 --> 01:38:41.376]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives in vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[01:38:41.396 --> 01:38:48.741]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[01:38:50.017 --> 01:39:00.986]  Now, the reason I play that probably for the 300th time over the years is that's what I call the over-the-top stratagem of these companies that funded that fake PR piece to be put out.
[01:39:01.927 --> 01:39:05.289]  That, oh, we know it's hurting women and the insert says don't give it to pregnant women.
[01:39:05.770 --> 01:39:07.131]  Just take it off the insert.
[01:39:08.317 --> 01:39:12.039]  Well, listening to this piece that you played, that was a very clever way that they came out with this.
[01:39:12.379 --> 01:39:12.920]  What they found
[01:39:32.682 --> 01:39:37.505]  Was that these kids that live on islands who eat whale meat.
[01:39:37.625 --> 01:39:41.527]  Whale meat has the highest mercury level of any sea creek.
[01:39:42.727 --> 01:39:54.713]  And they found out that if they ate the whale meat and had high mercury levels, but they also had very high omega-3 intake, it blunted the damaging effect of the mercury.
[01:39:55.674 --> 01:39:59.396]  So they had a slightly higher IQ than
[01:40:00.057 --> 01:40:09.665]  People who were deficient in omega-3, but they were far below the IQ elevation of those who didn't have the mercury.
[01:40:10.446 --> 01:40:26.800]  So they just restated this, implying that the mercury was making the kids smarter and it wasn't the omega-3, but the mercury was interfering with the ability of omega-3 to improve mental function.
[01:40:28.025 --> 01:40:40.848]  Now, the fact that mercury is harmful to the brain, there's more research than you could read the titles to the articles that prove it beyond any stretch of the imagination.
[01:40:41.508 --> 01:40:51.711]  Minute doses, doses that are almost in a nano concentration, can produce significant brain destruction and damage.
[01:40:51.751 --> 01:40:52.991]  It goes on for years.
[01:40:53.757 --> 01:40:55.919]  Now, that is so well demonstrated.
[01:40:55.959 --> 01:41:00.001]  For them to come out with this, it is an absolute lie.
[01:41:00.181 --> 01:41:01.342]  It was a distortion.
[01:41:01.542 --> 01:41:03.644]  It was nothing but pure propaganda.
[01:41:04.284 --> 01:41:10.449]  And it led to the harm of a lot of people, thinking that mercury actually improves your IQ.
[01:41:10.529 --> 01:41:14.011]  That's the most insane, idiotic statement I've ever heard.
[01:41:14.471 --> 01:41:15.352]  And it's unsupportable.
[01:41:16.232 --> 01:41:18.973]  But that's the kind of nonsense these people are involved in.
[01:41:19.053 --> 01:41:33.860]  What they do is they manipulate research, they pay scientists to produce phony research, they even have articles written by a professional company, and then have doctors put their name on it later because it's going to be in a prestigious journal.
[01:41:33.940 --> 01:41:37.942]  And the doctors didn't have anything to do with the writing of or the research.
[01:41:37.982 --> 01:41:40.963]  That's what the UN did with the 2,000 scientists on climate change.
[01:41:41.305 --> 01:41:42.749]  Well, this is happening all the time.
[01:41:43.891 --> 01:41:45.616]  Particularly these pharmaceutical companies.
[01:41:45.676 --> 01:41:48.583]  They pay this company to write fake articles.
[01:41:49.526 --> 01:41:56.389]  And then they'll go to Harvard or Yale or the big universities and get people to put their name on it to give it prestige.
[01:41:56.629 --> 01:42:00.831]  Exactly, but I'm not a brain surgeon, but I've seen hundreds of articles.
[01:42:00.871 --> 01:42:04.293]  I've seen, I mean nothing's been studied more than mercury the last 200 years.
[01:42:04.353 --> 01:42:08.054]  As you said, I mean it's the most destructive thing in the brain except for cyanide.
[01:42:08.314 --> 01:42:12.436]  We have the, guys type in electron microscope mercury and brain tissue.
[01:42:12.756 --> 01:42:14.037]  It causes electrochemical
[01:42:14.677 --> 01:42:22.004]  Chain reactions, explosions, I mean, how do they with straight faces say mercury is good for your child?
[01:42:22.324 --> 01:42:25.006]  I don't see mercury on the vitamin aisle.
[01:42:25.627 --> 01:42:28.089]  They say it because they're getting pockets full of money.
[01:42:29.430 --> 01:42:35.496]  These people are being paid huge amounts of money to make these absurd, harmful statements.
[01:42:35.656 --> 01:42:41.381]  The problem with the scientists that know better than this, the scientists who are doing the real research on mercury,
[01:42:42.020 --> 01:42:49.012]  Brain toxicity generally are badgered and terrified to speak out publicly.
[01:42:49.582 --> 01:42:52.024]  Because, number one, the media will not interview them.
[01:42:52.204 --> 01:42:54.085]  The media will not carry their story.
[01:42:55.426 --> 01:43:00.389]  And the only thing the media will do will destroy their reputations.
[01:43:00.689 --> 01:43:08.033]  And then the pharmaceutical companies and the government and agencies will do everything they can to get these people to lose their jobs.
[01:43:08.093 --> 01:43:10.295]  And this has happened time and time again.
[01:43:10.915 --> 01:43:18.640]  A good friend of mine, David Lewis, wrote a book called Science for Sale, which I recommend anybody that's interested in this subject buy this book.
[01:43:19.814 --> 01:43:36.503]  He worked for the EPA for 30-plus years, and he exposed some of the phony things the EPA was doing that was harming people, published it in one of the most prestigious of the science magazines, and they fired him.
[01:43:37.583 --> 01:43:49.069]  And he goes through here and shows all the cases of people who've been fired, how they control science, how they control the media, tell these fake propaganda stories to the public.
[01:43:50.270 --> 01:43:57.375]  So that they can promote vaccine programs, they can promote fluoride, they can promote whatever they want to.
[01:43:58.055 --> 01:44:00.236]  And the real scientists are never interviewed.
[01:44:00.456 --> 01:44:09.842]  For instance, when they did this big study, the Veristratin study, no true mercury expert was even invited to the meeting.
[01:44:10.883 --> 01:44:16.566]  Now, there were a number that are world-renowned experts on mercury and the effect on the brain.
[01:44:17.146 --> 01:44:18.247]  They weren't consulted.
[01:44:19.483 --> 01:44:22.925]  None of their articles were even quoted or entered into this study.
[01:44:23.785 --> 01:44:29.788]  But even so, the study found that mercury damaged the brains of these children that were from vaccines.
[01:44:30.549 --> 01:44:36.791]  And then they altered the study when they published it in the journal Pediatrics, so it said just the opposite.
[01:44:38.132 --> 01:44:45.135]  This is the kind of shenanigans that goes on every day, and this is the kind of nonsense that the average physician is reading.
[01:44:45.335 --> 01:44:46.136]  So let me ask you this.
[01:44:47.529 --> 01:44:56.235]  Big Pharma just wants to make money, but as we know, Bayer knew they were shipping out the HIV and Hepatitis and the Factor VIII, did it on purpose, didn't care, that came out in trial.
[01:44:57.195 --> 01:45:00.838]  Is it eugenics steering it all, or is it they just don't care?
[01:45:00.878 --> 01:45:09.363]  I mean, how do you get executives, and then this whole chain of people, to get up there and say mercury's good for your kid, and to cover up all the bad things that are happening?
[01:45:09.864 --> 01:45:11.044]  How did it get so evil?
[01:45:11.124 --> 01:45:11.805]  What's going on?
[01:45:12.608 --> 01:45:21.575]  Well, I think the number one driving force for CEOs of companies and head of the Pediatrics Association and all this is money.
[01:45:22.253 --> 01:45:23.614]  They're buying these people.
[01:45:24.074 --> 01:45:26.896]  They're putting large amounts of money into their pocket.
[01:45:27.837 --> 01:45:43.228]  The doctors that are experts and top people at Harvard and Yale and Columbia, they are approached and given contracts to do fake research for these pharmaceutical companies, and they can't resist the money.
[01:45:43.388 --> 01:45:44.088]  It's just too much.
[01:45:44.208 --> 01:45:44.989]  It's too lucrative.
[01:45:45.349 --> 01:45:48.111]  Some of these people are making millions of dollars off of this.
[01:45:48.331 --> 01:45:51.254]  And now they've done the fake research, so now they're part of the crew.
[01:45:51.534 --> 01:45:52.555]  They're now compromised.
[01:45:52.575 --> 01:45:55.919]  They're now defending it because they don't want to be discredited.
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:45:57.821]  Exactly.
[01:45:57.841 --> 01:46:11.214]  And so the real physician, the real researcher who's doing this research that's demonstrating this damage, he's told what you can publish in your journals, but don't ever approach the media.
[01:46:11.984 --> 01:46:24.482]  Uh, you know, there's been numerous cases of these people publishing these articles or trying to get them published in journals and having the pharmaceutical company approach the journal and have the article removed.
[01:46:25.276 --> 01:46:27.037]  This has happened numerous times.
[01:46:27.517 --> 01:46:28.657]  Very good research.
[01:46:28.757 --> 01:46:29.998]  Carefully done research.
[01:46:30.418 --> 01:46:39.681]  But if it shows harm of a pharmaceutical product that's making them billions of dollars, they will use their influence on that journal to have that article removed.
[01:46:39.781 --> 01:46:46.364]  Now, some journals beyond that won't do that, but there's a lot that will.
[01:46:46.404 --> 01:46:49.225]  And a lot of them are the journals that physicians are reading.
[01:46:49.805 --> 01:46:51.786]  So the physician reads these articles.
[01:46:51.886 --> 01:46:54.507]  He thinks it's in a prestigious journal, and he believes it.
[01:46:55.556 --> 01:47:01.782]  Uh, he will not do the homework that takes deeper reading, deeper understanding, and find out he's being lied to.
[01:47:01.802 --> 01:47:05.765]  So they paw parrot this nonsense to their patience.
[01:47:07.011 --> 01:47:08.432]  It's just like this Gardasil thing.
[01:47:08.552 --> 01:47:20.561]  I can't believe that physicians see an 11-year-old girl and 10-year-old girl and tell that mother that that child needs to have a Gardasil vaccine or she's going to get cervical cancer.
[01:47:20.641 --> 01:47:27.005]  Now, number one, he doesn't know anything about HPV virus if he says that because it's sheer nonsense.
[01:47:27.711 --> 01:47:29.552]  And he doesn't know anything about the vaccine.
[01:47:29.992 --> 01:47:33.594]  Now there's been almost 100 girls have died from that vaccine.
[01:47:33.614 --> 01:47:35.955]  There's been thousands that have been harmed.
[01:47:36.095 --> 01:47:37.435]  They continue to be harmed.
[01:47:38.376 --> 01:47:41.397]  And the insert says it doesn't even protect you from HPV.
[01:47:41.677 --> 01:47:44.198]  I want to shift gears to the time we have left and talk about Obamacare.
[01:47:45.119 --> 01:47:46.580]  Now they admit the death panels.
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:48.500]  They admit VA's secret death list.
[01:47:50.532 --> 01:47:53.053]  Ezekiel Emanuel admits it's about getting rid of old people.
[01:47:53.354 --> 01:47:54.955]  An article he wrote, it's time to die by 75.
[01:47:55.975 --> 01:47:57.196]  The case for killing Granny.
[01:47:57.216 --> 01:47:59.197]  21 new taxes.
[01:47:59.557 --> 01:48:00.958]  Bankrupting poor people.
[01:48:01.558 --> 01:48:03.259]  Payroll taxes on poor people.
[01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:05.200]  Rich companies exempt.
[01:48:05.581 --> 01:48:11.904]  I mean, such a monumental screwjob, and the Democrats and Republican leadership defend it.
[01:48:12.765 --> 01:48:19.709]  I mean, is that not a manifest conviction of the power structure that they would bring in this eugenics-based system?
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:25.222]  Yeah, I mean, the Obamacare is just an absolute outrage.
[01:48:25.302 --> 01:48:27.503]  It was a fraud from the very beginning.
[01:48:27.763 --> 01:48:30.745]  It was sold on fraudulent data.
[01:48:31.545 --> 01:48:40.750]  The people who really knew about medical health care, who came forward and said that the numbers you're quoting are false, they're not real.
[01:48:41.570 --> 01:48:48.554]  Most of these people that are uninsured are people who have chosen on their own not to do it because they don't want to spend the money.
[01:48:49.074 --> 01:48:52.257]  They're young, they're healthy, and they don't see any reason to do it.
[01:48:52.938 --> 01:49:05.589]  Well, they inflated the number even further than that to give the public the impression there were all these tens of millions of people that were uncovered and the government was going to do the benevolent thing and make sure they were covered.
[01:49:05.669 --> 01:49:07.350]  Well, they lied from the very beginning.
[01:49:07.470 --> 01:49:08.671]  Oh, you can keep your doctor.
[01:49:09.112 --> 01:49:10.933]  Oh, you can go to any hospital you want to.
[01:49:10.993 --> 01:49:12.074]  You can keep your plan.
[01:49:12.474 --> 01:49:16.438]  They knew that the bill itself said none of that was true.
[01:49:17.405 --> 01:49:19.446]  The media covered for them, as always.
[01:49:19.966 --> 01:49:22.427]  You can always depend on the media to cover for these people.
[01:49:22.507 --> 01:49:30.870]  And then Ezekiel Emanuel admitted on Fox News, we played the clip probably 20 times, not going to play it again, he said, no, this is meant to wreck the old system.
[01:49:31.130 --> 01:49:32.891]  We're working with the insurance companies to do it.
[01:49:33.111 --> 01:49:37.352]  There'll be a few big ones left at the end, and they'll dole out government controlled care.
[01:49:37.593 --> 01:49:46.736]  They admit they are trying to ruin the system, just like you said four years ago on this show, to kick all the old doctors in and bring in a bunch of foreign doctors that aren't even doctors.
[01:49:47.432 --> 01:49:51.913]  Well, most of the people I know in medicine are saying, I can't wait to retire.
[01:49:51.933 --> 01:49:53.473]  I want to get out of it.
[01:49:53.994 --> 01:49:59.655]  I can't stand all this paperwork and control and regimentation and being forced to hurt my patients.
[01:50:00.055 --> 01:50:00.635]  They want out.
[01:50:01.575 --> 01:50:03.776]  And young people are not wanting to get in.
[01:50:03.976 --> 01:50:08.577]  So the answer is, and this is why the government's not worried about bringing in all these foreign doctors.
[01:50:09.518 --> 01:50:18.142]  Uh, from hundreds of countries around the world who, they've been practicing in socialized medicine, so they don't see anything wrong with it.
[01:50:18.162 --> 01:50:26.506]  They'll come here and practice in American socialized medicine because the system they operate in is in shambles, so they figure this has to be better.
[01:50:27.256 --> 01:50:28.777]  Until it ends up in shambles.
[01:50:28.797 --> 01:50:34.402]  Yeah, it's like Californians fleeing to come to Austin and then try to take my guns and raise taxes and wreck everything.
[01:50:34.743 --> 01:50:40.968]  It's like they wreck one place and then they go to the next place to wreck it and like a bunch of locusts they just move to the next target.
[01:50:41.308 --> 01:50:52.738]  Well, I've always said that we need report cards for the public because no one is paying attention that every one of these programs, every one of these socialist systems, every socialist country is in shamble.
[01:50:53.619 --> 01:50:54.920]  Absolute shamble.
[01:50:55.612 --> 01:51:04.635]  And yet there has not been a single success report card of any of these systems, and we keep playing it out as if it's the utopian future.
[01:51:05.676 --> 01:51:06.276]  Absolutely.
[01:51:06.296 --> 01:51:07.656]  Just stay there, Dr. Blaylock.

[01:52:10.037 --> 01:52:11.278]  Another major health threat.
[01:52:11.298 --> 01:52:16.200]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:52:16.260 --> 01:52:18.881]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:52:18.901 --> 01:52:25.724]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:52:25.984 --> 01:52:28.865]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:52:28.985 --> 01:52:31.907]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:52:31.927 --> 01:52:33.928]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:52:33.948 --> 01:52:36.849]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:52:36.869 --> 01:52:42.390]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:52:42.590 --> 01:52:46.091]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:52:46.111 --> 01:52:49.132]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[01:53:23.118 --> 01:53:26.160]  Fool the bad guys with a new improved fake TV.
[01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:32.763]  You asked for it, we listened, and we made our new fake TV three times brighter than our previous model.

[01:53:37.065 --> 01:53:41.808]  It simulates the color and motion of a real TV while you're away from home.
[01:53:42.368 --> 01:53:48.492]  And when burglars think someone is home watching television, they're likely to pass your house and move on to an easier target.
[01:53:48.833 --> 01:53:53.276]  The new, brighter Fake TV is only $39.95 and includes free shipping.

[01:53:57.939 --> 01:53:58.419]  Fake TV.
[01:53:58.459 --> 01:54:00.000]  The burglar deterrent.
[01:54:23.456 --> 01:54:27.919]  Well, we got some really bad news a few hours ago and we just confirmed it with his wife.
[01:54:28.439 --> 01:54:30.380]  I'm going to talk about this at the start of the next hour.
[01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:36.203]  Dr. Stan Monteith, medical doctor, passed away this morning after battling cancer a long time.
[01:54:36.664 --> 01:54:38.225]  He is resting in peace with the Lord.
[01:54:39.105 --> 01:54:40.346]  And they don't want folks to call.
[01:54:40.546 --> 01:54:44.609]  They said if you want to write support or letters to the family, it's Radio Liberty P.O.
[01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:54.016]  Box 969 and I guess that's S-O-Q-U-E-L California 95073.
[01:54:56.878 --> 01:55:01.862]  And he was just an amazing guy and I don't think anybody had more total knowledge
[01:55:05.650 --> 01:55:11.712]  of what was going on and the medical tyranny and why they were doing it than Dr. Stan Monteith.
[01:55:11.772 --> 01:55:18.134]  I mean he would do five hours of radio a day on over a hundred stations around the country including some of our affiliates and it's a true loss.
[01:55:18.154 --> 01:55:21.735]  I don't know how to eulogize him at this point except fight back against the tyranny.
[01:55:22.236 --> 01:55:25.657]  I know even he was on about a few months ago while battling cancer
[01:55:26.792 --> 01:55:27.613]  Well, Stan was a good friend of mine.
[01:55:27.653 --> 01:55:29.574]  I've been to his house, know his wife and his son.
[01:55:56.210 --> 01:55:57.691]  I was very close to Stan.
[01:55:57.852 --> 01:56:02.395]  He's a man of enormous virtue, honesty.
[01:56:02.475 --> 01:56:07.460]  He just loved this country, and he loved freedom, and he fought for it.
[01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:10.382]  He spent all his money on that radio station.
[01:56:10.422 --> 01:56:14.405]  He's just the most wonderful man that I've ever met.
[01:56:14.425 --> 01:56:15.606]  It's incredible.
[01:56:15.666 --> 01:56:16.447]  It's old family.
[01:56:16.607 --> 01:56:20.370]  So I'm really saddened by this.
[01:56:21.251 --> 01:56:22.332]  But what I was telling you,
[01:56:22.978 --> 01:56:36.566]  And Stan, he liked when I would say these things, is that, you know, it's said that man is a socialist in direct proportion to his contempt for his fellow man.
[01:56:37.607 --> 01:56:38.527]  And that's what we see.
[01:56:38.748 --> 01:56:46.852]  These socialists, these central planners, the collectivists, have absolute arrogance.
[01:56:47.493 --> 01:56:49.254]  They see themselves as elites.
[01:56:49.969 --> 01:56:53.331]  That they should dominate and rule and design the world.
[01:56:54.031 --> 01:56:58.373]  And that people are nothing but useless, indolent, stupid cattle.
[01:56:59.154 --> 01:57:01.435]  To be moved around like a chess piece.
[01:57:02.495 --> 01:57:08.418]  And people, unfortunately, too many, are allowing themselves to be treated this way.
[01:57:09.059 --> 01:57:10.439]  You live in a free country.
[01:57:10.499 --> 01:57:12.940]  You have an opportunity to save yourself.
[01:57:13.721 --> 01:57:14.981]  But people need to wake up.
[01:57:15.142 --> 01:57:17.983]  They need to read about socialism, communism.
[01:57:18.644 --> 01:57:19.425]  Collectivism.
[01:57:19.505 --> 01:57:23.168]  They need to understand the words, the propaganda, how this works.
[01:57:25.310 --> 01:57:28.713]  And quit listening to the idiotic propaganda.
[01:57:29.695 --> 01:57:32.217]  They've literally written thousands of books.
[01:57:49.659 --> 01:57:51.821]  That's right, man.
[01:57:51.861 --> 01:57:56.046]  The media, they're yapdogs.
[01:57:56.346 --> 01:58:04.214]  They sit there and tell everybody, oh yeah, it's just what David Rockefeller said.
[01:58:04.234 --> 01:58:05.896]  It's exactly what Brzezinski said.
[01:58:06.297 --> 01:58:07.718]  I tell people, look at two things.
[01:58:08.259 --> 01:58:11.302]  Brzezinski and Rockefeller
[01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:17.105]  And Kissinger, right now, just recently, said, we need to get behind this president.
[01:58:17.165 --> 01:58:21.029]  He's the best president that we could have.
[01:58:21.870 --> 01:58:28.476]  Brzezinski was the one who promoted choosing Obama for the presidency.
[01:58:28.516 --> 01:58:30.919]  Now, Brzezinski's not a stupid man.
[01:58:31.039 --> 01:58:32.380]  He's a very powerful man.
[01:58:32.420 --> 01:58:34.142]  He created the Trilateral Commission.
[01:58:35.193 --> 01:58:39.257]  He writes books, numerous books about geopolitical design.
[01:58:39.317 --> 01:58:41.278]  Dr. Blaylock, the next hour is coming up.
[01:58:41.319 --> 01:58:53.349]  Do five more minutes with us and I know you gotta go to finish up talking about the master plan and a little bit more about your good friend, Dr. Stan Monteith.
[01:58:53.409 --> 01:58:57.152]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:59:00.458 --> 01:59:07.521]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:59:07.621 --> 01:59:09.781]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:59:09.961 --> 01:59:15.063]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:59:15.243 --> 01:59:20.185]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:59:20.405 --> 01:59:23.468]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:59:23.728 --> 01:59:27.592]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:59:27.812 --> 01:59:32.056]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:59:32.137 --> 01:59:42.166]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:59:42.366 --> 01:59:44.889]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs
[01:59:45.009 --> 01:59:45.910]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:45.930 --> 01:59:47.591]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.601 --> 02:00:20.784]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:21.444 --> 02:00:22.245]  You want answers?
[02:00:23.026 --> 02:00:23.926]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:24.567 --> 02:00:28.209]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:28.750 --> 02:00:32.813]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:34.734 --> 02:00:41.420]  I knew that Dr. Blaylock knew Dr. Stan Monteith, but I didn't know they were close friends, and that they'd even been helping him try to battle the cancer.
[02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:47.386]  He lived a lot longer than most people would, the type of cancer he had, and kept broadcasting the last few years with it.
[02:00:48.447 --> 02:00:58.072]  We're going to do a special report for Friday's show when Watson's sitting in and put together some of the older interviews and also some of our video interviews with Dr. Stan Monteith.
[02:00:58.112 --> 02:01:00.814]  We've got a bunch of them together to remember him.
[02:01:01.594 --> 02:01:08.698]  But just contrast this selfless, loving, informed, caring person versus a Hillary Clinton, a monstrous...
[02:01:09.338 --> 02:01:12.100]  People that just have total disdain and Ezekiel Emanuel.
[02:01:12.620 --> 02:01:17.904]  These people just drip hate and envy and fraud, but telling us they're virtuous and liberal.
[02:01:18.905 --> 02:01:24.028]  Any research lets you discover that we're dealing with craven sickos.
[02:01:25.249 --> 02:01:29.252]  Finishing up with their master plan, any other words about Dr. Stan Monteith, Dr. Blaylock?
[02:01:30.212 --> 02:01:36.517]  Well, the point I was making is that here with all the disasters, the Benghazi, the ISIS, the ISIL,
[02:01:37.527 --> 02:01:48.217]  The giveaway of the entire victory and all the sacrifice our armed forces have committed in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[02:01:48.257 --> 02:01:49.478]  He gave that all away.
[02:01:49.758 --> 02:01:50.439]  Gave it away.
[02:01:51.239 --> 02:02:00.808]  And yet, these two brilliant men, Kissinger and Brzezinski, say that this is the best and we should get behind the President?
[02:02:01.508 --> 02:02:04.271]  Now that tells you something about Kissinger and Brzezinski.
[02:02:04.921 --> 02:02:19.044]  Now, anybody who doesn't believe that there's something afoot that's quite foul in our world with these powerful men putting this traitor to our country as president, then there's something wrong.
[02:02:19.284 --> 02:02:20.425]  You need to look into it.
[02:02:20.505 --> 02:02:27.386]  Now, Stan Monteith was a man who always stood for truth over everything.
[02:02:29.007 --> 02:02:32.028]  Stan was one of the finest men.
[02:02:32.048 --> 02:02:33.808]  He was an orthopedic surgeon.
[02:02:34.768 --> 02:02:41.530]  And he spent all his time on this radio broadcast, researching, traveling, teaching, lecturing.
[02:02:41.550 --> 02:02:47.733]  He just was determined to tell people what was going on.
[02:02:47.773 --> 02:02:49.193]  He was a voracious reader.
[02:02:49.653 --> 02:02:58.236]  He knew numerous people of high position who were telling him information from the inside.
[02:02:58.296 --> 02:02:59.837]  We've lost one of the great men.
[02:03:00.698 --> 02:03:02.180]  I don't think you can quantify.
[02:03:10.057 --> 02:03:20.266]  The effect he's had, that's why I admire him, you and Ron Paul and so many others, who truly are out there trying to educate, telling the truth, trying to stop this evil.
[02:03:20.587 --> 02:03:29.395]  And as bad as things are, if it wasn't for all the people like Congressman McDonald and countless others that came before us, we would already be completely overtaken.
[02:03:29.815 --> 02:03:33.619]  These collectivists have already taken down most of the world, they've taken us down to a great extent, but
[02:03:36.206 --> 02:03:40.510]  We just can't quantify where we'd be if it wasn't for people like Dr. Stan Monteith.
[02:03:41.471 --> 02:03:45.034]  Yeah, his contribution is unmeasurable.
[02:03:45.674 --> 02:03:51.519]  And his influence on people around the world is incredible.
[02:03:52.180 --> 02:03:59.206]  I've hardly met a person anywhere who is involved in this that doesn't know Stan Monteith.
[02:04:00.215 --> 02:04:01.396]  He's interviewed everybody.
[02:04:01.436 --> 02:04:05.819]  I mean, he interviewed the highest ranking people, royalty.
[02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:07.701]  It didn't matter who they were.
[02:04:07.721 --> 02:04:10.903]  Somehow he ended up getting them on his radio program.
[02:04:10.963 --> 02:04:13.005]  He was an amazing person.
[02:04:14.106 --> 02:04:19.289]  Well, I hope when I check out I can be, you know, just half as good and prolific as he was.
[02:04:19.329 --> 02:04:22.632]  He's a real example of a role model, a real man.
[02:04:23.766 --> 02:04:26.389]  Well he is and you're carrying on in his tradition.
[02:04:27.271 --> 02:04:35.381]  You're bringing people to your radio program that have an important story to tell and that's how people learn.
[02:04:35.401 --> 02:04:39.166]  The interviews I hear on your program are some of the most important.
[02:04:40.207 --> 02:04:43.729]  Uh, people and defenders of liberty I've ever heard.
[02:04:44.089 --> 02:04:46.071]  BlaylockHealthChannel.com.
[02:04:46.111 --> 02:04:47.531]  Thank you so much, Dr. Blaylock.
[02:04:47.812 --> 02:04:50.553]  And you're even upping your game in the face of tyranny.
[02:04:50.893 --> 02:04:51.154]  That's it.
[02:04:51.194 --> 02:04:54.876]  We all have to redouble because we have a chance to turn this around.
[02:04:54.916 --> 02:04:56.076]  God bless you, Dr. Blaylock.
[02:04:56.216 --> 02:04:57.377]  Well, God bless you, too, Alex.
[02:04:57.677 --> 02:04:59.999]  And God bless Dr. Stan Monteith.
[02:05:00.039 --> 02:05:01.159]  Just such a sweetheart.
[02:05:01.840 --> 02:05:03.781]  And I'm just so sad to hear he's died.
[02:05:04.221 --> 02:05:07.943]  But really, it's bittersweet because he just did such a great job.
[02:05:08.003 --> 02:05:08.964]  He's such a winner.
[02:05:11.161 --> 02:05:12.242]  Open your eyes.
[02:05:12.683 --> 02:05:15.605]  It's time to give your eyes a powerful nutritional boost.
[02:05:16.086 --> 02:05:22.231]  Sight is the primary input to the brain, arguably making eyesight the most important sense we have.

[02:05:30.939 --> 02:05:32.020]  Open your eyes!

[02:06:02.219 --> 02:06:02.859]  Open your eyes.
[02:06:11.038 --> 02:06:16.422]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:06:17.683 --> 02:06:22.426]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:06:22.826 --> 02:06:29.611]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:06:31.552 --> 02:06:34.815]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:06:35.615 --> 02:06:37.917]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:06:40.038 --> 02:06:43.901]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:06:44.621 --> 02:06:47.744]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[02:06:48.464 --> 02:06:49.285]  Others don't.
[02:06:49.705 --> 02:06:51.586]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:06:51.846 --> 02:06:53.368]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:06:53.628 --> 02:06:56.210]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:06:56.510 --> 02:07:02.774]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:07:03.134 --> 02:07:05.336]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:07:05.856 --> 02:07:07.878]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[02:07:08.218 --> 02:07:09.019]  Others don't.
[02:07:10.313 --> 02:07:18.805]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being, and you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[02:07:18.985 --> 02:07:25.253]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[02:07:25.514 --> 02:07:25.774]  Now,
[02:07:26.154 --> 02:07:29.257]  Our extra-strength new nascent iodine formula is here.
[02:07:29.497 --> 02:07:30.858]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:07:31.138 --> 02:07:43.608]  Leading the way into the next generation of super high-quality nascent iodine, InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200-plus million-year-old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[02:07:43.988 --> 02:07:51.974]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients, and completely vegan.
[02:07:52.094 --> 02:07:55.517]  We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 iodine for radiation.
[02:07:55.737 --> 02:07:57.698]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:07:57.758 --> 02:07:59.119]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:27.782 --> 02:08:35.626]  I guess it was about four years ago, I spoke to a capacity hall in Santa Cruz, where Dr. Stan Monteith lived.
[02:08:39.328 --> 02:08:44.690]  And he hobbled over on his bad hips to the microphone, gave a speech.
[02:08:46.831 --> 02:08:51.333]  And we're going to get that speech and air it on the nightly news tonight.
[02:08:51.834 --> 02:08:54.675]  Probably air some of it today before this hour ends.
[02:08:55.936 --> 02:08:56.116]  But,
[02:08:58.465 --> 02:08:59.425]  He died this morning.
[02:08:59.726 --> 02:09:02.407]  Dr. Stan Monteith passed away, GCN Radio host.
[02:09:03.247 --> 02:09:05.568]  This morning, battled cancer for several years.
[02:09:06.328 --> 02:09:08.629]  He's resting with the Lord in peace.
[02:09:09.549 --> 02:09:15.592]  And they've asked you not to call Radio Liberty, because obviously a lot of people are doing that, that you just write any support.
[02:09:16.092 --> 02:09:16.912]  Radio Liberty, P.O.
[02:09:16.952 --> 02:09:20.393]  Box 969, Soquel, California, S-O-Q-U-E-L 95073.
[02:09:28.070 --> 02:09:32.414]  And a few hours ago, I learned about this from Ted Anderson, who was friends with him as well.
[02:09:33.695 --> 02:09:37.558]  And I wanted to call, I believe, Ted, but I wanted to talk to Stan's family, and we did.
[02:09:38.479 --> 02:09:40.001]  So this little message was written by them.
[02:09:40.081 --> 02:09:40.921]  We took it over the phone.
[02:09:40.941 --> 02:09:50.990]  I know we have a lot of AM and FM affiliates out there that are new, so you may not know who Dr. Stan Monteith was, but for almost 50 years,
[02:09:53.823 --> 02:10:14.756]  He warned of the globalist takeover, he interviewed everybody, MI6 chiefs to former prime ministers, to senators, to just you name it, all the KGB defectors, and you name it, he interviewed them.
[02:10:14.776 --> 02:10:16.677]  He was interviewing G. Edward Griffin 40 years ago.
[02:10:18.513 --> 02:10:21.035]  He was interviewing Anthony Sutton 30 years ago.
[02:10:21.815 --> 02:10:24.457]  He was interviewing Senator Church of the Church Committees.
[02:10:24.537 --> 02:10:31.462]  I mean, just, he was immersed in this, no exaggeration, with that focus of an old-line professional medical doctor.
[02:10:31.482 --> 02:10:34.124]  He quit his practice to focus on this, I guess, 30 years ago.
[02:10:35.305 --> 02:10:36.606]  Very lucrative, successful.
[02:10:37.767 --> 02:10:40.709]  And just put everything he had, and worked 18 hours a day.
[02:10:43.475 --> 02:10:44.135]  18 hours a day.
[02:10:44.556 --> 02:10:47.517]  When he had cancer, he would just sleep and then get up and do radio shows.
[02:10:48.297 --> 02:10:50.778]  I'm not going to get into all the stuff I know, the back story.
[02:10:51.478 --> 02:10:53.879]  We were there two years ago for the Obama Deception 2.
[02:10:54.159 --> 02:10:55.160]  I got to put that film out.
[02:10:56.600 --> 02:10:58.721]  And he didn't want to tell us he had cancer at the time.
[02:10:58.741 --> 02:10:59.601]  We learned about it later.
[02:10:59.621 --> 02:11:04.083]  And he would like talk for 10 minutes, go in a room and obviously throw up and stuff.
[02:11:04.783 --> 02:11:07.124]  And then just like come out and do the interview.
[02:11:07.744 --> 02:11:08.165]  And it was big.
[02:11:08.345 --> 02:11:10.145]  And he had all these archives too.
[02:11:10.205 --> 02:11:11.446]  He was offering them to us.
[02:11:12.517 --> 02:11:13.918]  He's saying, I don't know what to do with all this.
[02:11:14.498 --> 02:11:15.899]  We don't have, we don't know what to do with it.
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:26.407]  Literally thousands of film reels and rooms of documents and just, Dr. Stan, whenever we would have some piece of information, he would call and say, I want the source of that.
[02:11:27.628 --> 02:11:31.851]  Or when someone claims something, he would, he would ferret it out and discover who the source was.
[02:11:32.412 --> 02:11:38.256]  He obviously had a lot of intelligence operatives and people feeding him info because he had so much integrity and
[02:11:40.219 --> 02:11:43.881]  He exposed that HIV was a race-specific bioweapon, got the documents.
[02:11:45.182 --> 02:11:48.764]  He never wanted any of the credit for anything.
[02:11:49.725 --> 02:11:54.208]  So many times you track something back to Dr. Stan Monteith.
[02:11:55.854 --> 02:12:08.785]  You track it back to where he'd gotten the document, where he had originally, of course it was in the New York Times, but he'd made a big deal about it back in 1976, whenever Mao Zedong, I think it was 76, died and David Rockefeller wrote an obituary about how wonderful he was.
[02:12:09.105 --> 02:12:14.410]  It was Monteith who made copies of that by the thousands and sent it out to radio people and sent it to Congress and freaked out.
[02:12:14.990 --> 02:12:16.732]  He was one of those people that just
[02:12:17.540 --> 02:12:33.107]  was always at the epicenter of of good change and and defending liberty and battling tyranny and and he did it absolutely with a servant's heart and that's what mattered and uh...
[02:12:34.534 --> 02:12:35.555]  You just gotta be proud of him.
[02:12:36.315 --> 02:12:39.998]  There is so much honor in that and such a sense of completion.
[02:12:40.619 --> 02:12:58.572]  And even though it's sad, it's bittersweet because there's real satisfaction in a man and a family and his wife who've lived integrity, who've lived dedication to fighting evil, who have focused like a laser beam with a commitment.
[02:12:59.593 --> 02:13:00.874]  That's what manliness is.
[02:13:01.539 --> 02:13:09.605]  Not acting tough, not shooting up a bar, not running around, you know, flexing your muscles, threatening other people or road rage.
[02:13:10.266 --> 02:13:23.816]  Manliness is full-on dedication for 14, 18 hours a day for 47, 48 years when he discovered the New World Order conspiracy to fight it and hold it back.
[02:13:27.754 --> 02:13:28.615]  That's a commitment.
[02:13:28.855 --> 02:13:32.938]  Just quiet, focused, in there hammering away at the enemy.
[02:13:33.718 --> 02:13:35.499]  And it takes different strokes for different folks.
[02:13:37.941 --> 02:13:40.803]  I'm, you know, boisterous, angry, aggressive.
[02:13:41.143 --> 02:13:42.764]  Because I got into this when I was 20 years old.
[02:13:43.045 --> 02:13:43.705]  I'm 40 now.
[02:13:44.526 --> 02:13:48.708]  And I get angry when I learn our government funded Mao who killed 84 million people.
[02:13:48.929 --> 02:13:49.709]  I feel threatened!
[02:13:51.050 --> 02:13:52.251]  At a very primitive level.
[02:13:54.092 --> 02:13:56.534]  But people like Stan Montief can control it.
[02:13:58.030 --> 02:14:00.771]  Obviously feeling the same thing, and focus it.
[02:14:01.591 --> 02:14:05.853]  Now some could say, obviously in my 20 years, I've been more successful than Monteith in his 47.
[02:14:06.853 --> 02:14:09.894]  We don't measure things like that, because we stand on his shoulders.
[02:14:10.494 --> 02:14:14.716]  That's why little things you do to fight evil, help an old lady across the street,
[02:14:15.714 --> 02:14:17.735]  Praising a police officer when they do the right thing.
[02:14:18.035 --> 02:14:20.297]  Getting in a police officer's face when they do the wrong thing.
[02:14:21.077 --> 02:14:22.018]  Running for mayor.
[02:14:22.978 --> 02:14:24.719]  Decrying yourself when you do the right thing.
[02:14:25.260 --> 02:14:26.200]  Helping your family.
[02:14:26.600 --> 02:14:30.943]  Not just throwing, you know, grandma in a nursing home to die, but actually taking care of her.
[02:14:30.963 --> 02:14:32.604]  Or making sure they're taken care of at the nursing home.
[02:14:33.445 --> 02:14:35.906]  It's an inside job with all of us to make a better world.
[02:14:36.726 --> 02:14:38.487]  Not letting government treat us like slaves.
[02:14:38.888 --> 02:14:39.688]  Having dignity.
[02:14:40.669 --> 02:14:41.469]  Being honest.
[02:14:43.090 --> 02:14:44.291]  Confronting corruption.
[02:14:50.342 --> 02:14:53.563]  That's what this journey is all about.
[02:14:55.344 --> 02:15:04.667]  And none of you know, I don't know, what ripples in the pond our lives, like rocks hitting the surface, what ripples will touch others.
[02:15:05.608 --> 02:15:08.049]  I mean, I've been in the pond jumping around, splashing quite a bit.
[02:15:08.909 --> 02:15:19.333]  But the real power of InfoWars is you, the listeners, taking action, spreading the word, doing your own AXS TV show, your own YouTube channel, your own local radio show.
[02:15:21.090 --> 02:15:21.970]  Encouraging others.
[02:15:22.531 --> 02:15:27.554]  You don't know who you're going to warn who laughs at you but five years later wakes up.
[02:15:27.895 --> 02:15:32.218]  You don't know how those dominoes and those chain reactions connect into others.
[02:15:33.117 --> 02:15:33.878]  The enemy does.
[02:15:34.819 --> 02:15:35.539]  They have an idea.
[02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:38.182]  Because they understand the power of the individual.
[02:15:38.802 --> 02:15:41.485]  They know what they've done working together in evil, what power it had.
[02:15:42.065 --> 02:15:43.406]  So they know you have power.
[02:15:43.446 --> 02:15:44.687]  They know I have power.
[02:15:45.148 --> 02:15:47.290]  And so they're always there telling us we don't have power.
[02:15:47.310 --> 02:15:50.112]  They're always there telling us that it's all loss, there's nothing we can do.
[02:15:50.633 --> 02:15:51.373]  Revelling in it.
[02:15:51.413 --> 02:15:52.634]  Yeah, your kids belong to us.
[02:15:52.935 --> 02:15:54.376]  Yeah, 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[02:15:54.696 --> 02:15:55.977]  Yeah, you didn't build your business.
[02:15:55.998 --> 02:15:58.119]  Yeah, we're going to get your Bible and your guns.
[02:15:58.880 --> 02:16:01.902]  Because they want to dominate us through their disdain.
[02:16:02.483 --> 02:16:08.107]  Real men and women have too much pride and honor to want to dominate someone who's even lesser.
[02:16:08.888 --> 02:16:10.509]  Or to take advantage of stupid people.
[02:16:10.729 --> 02:16:11.750]  You try to build them up.
[02:16:13.892 --> 02:16:15.553]  So incredibly pathetic.
[02:16:16.113 --> 02:16:20.617]  And the disdain for humanity you people have out there that serve evil makes you want to throw up.
[02:16:22.078 --> 02:16:22.959]  You're a bunch of cowards.
[02:16:23.019 --> 02:16:25.401]  I guarantee you get in a ring with somebody who loves liberty.
[02:16:26.121 --> 02:16:29.347]  Put a battle axe in each person's hand, I don't care how big the evil guy is.
[02:16:30.569 --> 02:16:33.735]  You people will start crapping your pants when it comes time to die.
[02:16:34.417 --> 02:16:36.360]  You're a bunch of cowards and you know it.
[02:16:36.801 --> 02:16:38.424]  And you live in constant fear.
[02:16:39.639 --> 02:16:41.560]  And thank God I'm not part of you people.
[02:16:41.640 --> 02:16:49.563]  Thank God that in all my warts, in all my problems, in all my sin, in all my worldliness, my heart's right and I love justice.
[02:16:49.603 --> 02:16:51.944]  Thank God I don't pray on the innocent.
[02:16:52.004 --> 02:16:58.267]  Thank God that I'm a little bit like my dad and a little bit like somebody like Dr. Stan Montief or Ron Paul.
[02:16:58.327 --> 02:16:58.987]  Thank God.
[02:16:59.207 --> 02:17:00.367]  And I want to become better.
[02:17:00.988 --> 02:17:01.988]  I want to be strong.
[02:17:02.448 --> 02:17:05.950]  I don't ever, ever, ever want to serve the devil.
[02:17:06.860 --> 02:17:13.066]  And I'm here to tell you, you people that get up there with these death panels for old people and these death panels for the veterans, you're serving the devil.
[02:17:14.007 --> 02:17:16.769]  And you may not believe in God, you may not believe in an afterlife.
[02:17:16.949 --> 02:17:18.090]  Let me tell you how the world works.
[02:17:18.491 --> 02:17:26.698]  Guaranteed, everything you're doing to the innocents, everything you're doing to people that are under your power, is going to come back on you tenfold.
[02:17:26.938 --> 02:17:31.222]  You can be assured you will pay in this life, and your children will pay.
[02:17:32.116 --> 02:17:32.937]  Remember that!
[02:17:33.257 --> 02:17:36.780]  Your family name will pay, your line will pay.
[02:17:38.641 --> 02:17:41.544]  Everything you do comes back on you and comes back on your line.
[02:17:42.645 --> 02:17:45.527]  And the world is falling to evil right now.
[02:17:46.087 --> 02:17:50.091]  People can point their fingers at the West and say it's the great source of evil.
[02:17:51.492 --> 02:17:59.939]  But it was also a great source of liberty, so more wealth was produced here, so evil came to take it over, to turn it towards an engine of planetary evil.
[02:18:01.343 --> 02:18:02.955]  Planetary cancer!
[02:18:04.164 --> 02:18:05.585]  And that's what we face now.
[02:18:06.186 --> 02:18:11.610]  So many trendies go, well, there are seven and a half or seven hundred, seven billion, three hundred and something million people.
[02:18:11.630 --> 02:18:12.831]  I mean, there are too many people.
[02:18:12.991 --> 02:18:14.472]  I mean, we do need to sterilize people.
[02:18:14.592 --> 02:18:17.394]  And they'll kind of wink and giggle about it like they're part of it.
[02:18:17.655 --> 02:18:20.016]  You fools, you're being targeted as well.
[02:18:20.237 --> 02:18:31.886]  We should be working to build up humanity, working to find solutions, working to be honest, not working to put deadly vaccines into pregnant women that they know brain damages their babies bare minimum.
[02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:34.919]  I mean, it's all planned, people!
[02:18:39.008 --> 02:18:39.829]  Don't you understand?
[02:18:39.889 --> 02:18:41.550]  You cannot sign on to this!
[02:18:41.910 --> 02:18:43.271]  There's no debate!
[02:18:43.812 --> 02:18:45.573]  The world system is evil!
[02:18:46.173 --> 02:19:07.249]  And it now runs the major churches, it now runs the mainstream media, it's now got a bunch of self-centered people living on fiat money, living on the bubble, that when it collapses, it's going to be the greatest evil the world has ever seen, and anyone with discernment, anyone with intellectual acumen, anyone who's got any
[02:19:08.130 --> 02:19:14.719]  Sixth Sense, or a spirit, or dialed in, you can intellectually see it, but you can also feel it.
[02:19:16.261 --> 02:19:26.433]  The shields, the hedge of protection falling, and evil just boiling up like a tide of stinking death.
[02:19:27.293 --> 02:19:29.654]  My God, I don't want to be part of this.
[02:19:29.814 --> 02:19:31.335]  I don't want to see this unleashed.
[02:19:31.915 --> 02:19:40.339]  I want us all to repent and get our lives right and start going out and facing down evil and facing down the arrogant smile of its servants.
[02:19:41.394 --> 02:19:51.216]  That have just absolutely already turned their souls over to everything bad and are just burning, burning with hate for humanity, burning for hate for themselves.
[02:19:51.536 --> 02:19:55.017]  They've given up, they've given in, they've turned their souls over.
[02:19:55.217 --> 02:19:56.697]  They're not even humans anymore.
[02:19:56.997 --> 02:20:02.918]  They are nothing but biological androids possessed by the ghost and the machine and the spirit of our age.
[02:20:03.339 --> 02:20:08.200]  Satan, the devil, Baphomet, the great black snake, the dragon.
[02:20:08.580 --> 02:20:09.000]  We'll be back.
[02:20:10.700 --> 02:20:13.582]  The Feds are trying to ban your right to own body armor.
[02:20:13.822 --> 02:20:19.486]  It is crucial to purchase your body armor before it is too late and another one of your rights are taken away.

[02:20:40.901 --> 02:20:41.661]  Hey, Boomer!
[02:20:41.901 --> 02:20:45.223]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[02:20:45.343 --> 02:20:46.924]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[02:20:47.024 --> 02:20:48.765]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[02:20:48.965 --> 02:20:54.449]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[02:20:54.809 --> 02:20:55.549]  I know, right?
[02:20:55.629 --> 02:20:56.590]  You love it, too!

[02:21:43.894 --> 02:21:48.495]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[02:21:48.635 --> 02:21:49.656]  Talk about the effects.
[02:21:49.956 --> 02:21:51.436]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.

[02:21:55.197 --> 02:21:56.238]  I feel sexier.
[02:21:56.258 --> 02:21:57.018]  I love it.

[02:24:25.879 --> 02:24:35.044]  A second man, the story's up on InfoWars.com, has been arrested for threatening beheadings.
[02:24:35.984 --> 02:24:38.165]  Demo says that gives the propaganda war a boost.
[02:24:38.745 --> 02:24:39.346]  Certainly does.
[02:24:39.366 --> 02:24:41.607]  We can punch up InfoWars.com for TV viewers.
[02:24:42.027 --> 02:24:47.170]  Propaganda war gets boost from second Oklahoma man arrested for threatening ISIS beheadings.
[02:24:47.610 --> 02:24:53.393]  Homeland terror threat plays out as vital component in war on ISIS.
[02:24:54.534 --> 02:25:01.740]  Well, what you've got is mindless, dumbed-down people that think it's really cool to be part of the Islamic takeover.
[02:25:03.301 --> 02:25:05.062]  And again, radical Islamic takeover.
[02:25:05.102 --> 02:25:06.203]  I'm not an Islamophobe.
[02:25:07.184 --> 02:25:10.887]  This ISIS group's being funded by the West to destabilize the whole region.
[02:25:12.088 --> 02:25:16.851]  And it's a crime against those Arab countries and African countries, you name it.
[02:25:17.092 --> 02:25:18.493]  It's a clash of civilizations.
[02:25:19.312 --> 02:25:25.537]  But then you've got people out there, like Alton Nolan chopping heads off, stopped by a gun owner.
[02:25:26.938 --> 02:25:29.941]  By the company CEO.
[02:25:31.342 --> 02:25:32.683]  And that's what I've got right here.
[02:25:32.743 --> 02:25:33.163]  I mean, look.
[02:25:34.684 --> 02:25:36.226]  Get my instant access pistol safe?
[02:25:36.386 --> 02:25:37.407]  I mean, same thing.
[02:25:37.707 --> 02:25:38.387]  With a revolver.
[02:25:38.407 --> 02:25:41.230]  I mean, just... We've got a whole bunch of folks armed here at the office.
[02:25:41.770 --> 02:25:43.632]  Just like having screwdrivers or whatever else.
[02:25:44.212 --> 02:25:46.834]  I know folks that aren't from Texas come around here and they're like, what in the world?
[02:25:46.874 --> 02:25:47.595]  You know, you got guns?
[02:25:48.015 --> 02:25:48.616]  Yeah, we've got...
[02:25:49.927 --> 02:25:52.988]  M4s, you name it, shotguns, I mean, we're ready.
[02:25:53.908 --> 02:25:56.709]  And it's not that we're looking for trouble, just that somebody is looking for trouble.
[02:25:56.969 --> 02:26:03.151]  We're not going to get in a fetal position, like they train people to do to get shot in the back of the head, so this head shopper could kill ten of us.
[02:26:03.912 --> 02:26:06.312]  We're not going to get in a fetal position and start urinating on ourselves.
[02:26:07.353 --> 02:26:08.233]  Somebody wants a fight?
[02:26:09.593 --> 02:26:10.414]  Somebody's looking for trouble?
[02:26:10.574 --> 02:26:11.474]  They came to the right place.
[02:26:11.494 --> 02:26:12.894]  It's real simple.
[02:26:13.575 --> 02:26:14.415]  We're not living in fear.
[02:26:15.606 --> 02:26:17.248]  People say, oh, you must be fearful and paranoid.
[02:26:17.268 --> 02:26:17.808]  You got guns.
[02:26:17.868 --> 02:26:18.228]  No, no.
[02:26:18.529 --> 02:26:19.249]  It's the opposite.
[02:26:19.289 --> 02:26:20.290]  I got fists, too.
[02:26:23.193 --> 02:26:23.814]  For a reason.
[02:26:25.355 --> 02:26:26.656]  I'm not gonna roll over.
[02:26:27.457 --> 02:26:32.122]  I'm not going... I saw another article today about coyotes terrorizing people across the U.S.
[02:26:32.162 --> 02:26:33.143]  and eating people's pets.
[02:26:33.403 --> 02:26:34.404]  It's because nobody's shooting them.
[02:26:35.629 --> 02:26:36.749]  And it's in all the liberal areas.
[02:26:36.829 --> 02:26:37.709]  Oh, we can't allow that.
[02:26:38.049 --> 02:26:38.590]  They're animals.
[02:26:38.870 --> 02:26:41.170]  Okay, your dog and cats are all going to be dead then.
[02:26:41.530 --> 02:26:42.590]  See, this is how it works.
[02:26:42.610 --> 02:26:56.673]  You want to act like prey animals, and roll over, and teach your sons not to fight back, and your daughters not to fight back, and then you wonder why it's in liberal, feminist-controlled areas that the women are getting raped and attacked, and why your crime rates are 10, 15 times higher?
[02:26:56.973 --> 02:27:00.854]  It's because you've been raised to be prey to the criminal class.
[02:27:01.254 --> 02:27:01.434]  See,
[02:27:03.271 --> 02:27:14.801]  My granddaddy and my daddy raised me to be a farmer, and how to live off the land, and how to be a business man.
[02:27:15.802 --> 02:27:16.903]  You see, that's the difference.
[02:27:18.484 --> 02:27:21.267]  You got a country boy who can't survive, maybe we should come back with that.
[02:27:22.267 --> 02:27:26.011]  I live back in the woods to see the woman, the kids, and the dogs in me.
[02:27:28.021 --> 02:27:29.802]  I can skin a buck, I can run a trot line.
[02:27:30.123 --> 02:27:31.544]  They don't want that.
[02:27:32.184 --> 02:27:38.028]  And they don't want us as black, white, it doesn't matter, Hispanic, whatever, coming together around the family and around liberty.
[02:27:38.389 --> 02:27:41.251]  I got an article, I forgot to, it's in my office, actually in my bathroom.
[02:27:42.612 --> 02:27:43.973]  If somebody will bring it to me, it's out of the journal.
[02:27:44.013 --> 02:27:45.254]  Actually, I'll get it in the break and get it.
[02:27:45.694 --> 02:27:46.935]  It's out of the Journal of Nature.
[02:27:48.996 --> 02:27:57.863]  And it's an excellent article, actually, about how the family unit is what made humans so strong, starting with men and women being absolutely on the same team in the division of labor.
[02:27:58.603 --> 02:28:06.109]  But I read globalist stuff from the 60s about destroying the division of labor, destroying the human family, so the state could absorb us.
[02:28:07.070 --> 02:28:13.095]  And so this article is the same research, but from the perspective of why it's good for men and women to work together.
[02:28:13.925 --> 02:28:15.905]  So see, it's not just one big unified evil.
[02:28:16.185 --> 02:28:18.646]  People have already had so much of this, they know it's bad.
[02:28:19.066 --> 02:28:29.128]  Almost everyone I know, scientists, psychologists, futurists, inventors, anthropologists, sociologists, they get it now.
[02:28:30.408 --> 02:28:32.889]  But they can't get funded by the establishment.
[02:28:33.609 --> 02:28:37.570]  You've got to fund them by buying books and things and research.
[02:28:39.151 --> 02:28:40.533]  It's a money war, folks.
[02:28:41.173 --> 02:28:48.781]  But I'm telling you, most people in the establishment are easier to wake up than other people because they're so close to it, they know how creepy it is.
[02:28:50.896 --> 02:28:58.558]  But I mean, I was reading this whole thing about men and women and how that's what made humans superior and how we took over the planet was our teamwork.
[02:28:59.158 --> 02:29:03.899]  And not a fake collectivism where some ant hive tells us what to do, but we're in little units.
[02:29:04.379 --> 02:29:09.160]  We would vote to put in charge whoever was the smartest, the best, the most trustworthy.
[02:29:09.840 --> 02:29:11.841]  And it was a culture of honor and chivalry.
[02:29:12.361 --> 02:29:24.731]  Now, as the Agrarian Society came in the last 6,000 years, and cities got built, the corruption then became in, because you could have larger organized units, and it wasn't based on small bands and honor anymore.
[02:29:25.411 --> 02:29:27.633]  It was based on whoever had the most troops.
[02:29:28.233 --> 02:29:30.795]  And then taxation, and then decadence set in.
[02:29:31.596 --> 02:29:46.248]  And now we're going to see a hyper-confluence of all the billions of people, the high-tech, the decadence in the establishment, but also the public, the mistakes of the elites magnified into just such an incredible time to be alive.
[02:29:46.288 --> 02:29:49.571]  I mean, this is the most amazing time to ever be alive.
[02:29:50.791 --> 02:29:58.261]  From a macabre point of view, but also from an exhilarating point of view, we are going to see unbelievable things unfold.
[02:29:58.561 --> 02:29:59.703]  So strap yourselves in.
[02:29:59.723 --> 02:30:02.006]  But don't just be a spectator.
[02:30:02.226 --> 02:30:03.387]  Be on the field.
[02:30:03.407 --> 02:30:06.471]  This is your main battle test.
[02:30:07.212 --> 02:30:08.594]  Soldiers, this is it.
[02:30:10.512 --> 02:30:17.580]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:30:17.700 --> 02:30:19.842]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:30:20.022 --> 02:30:25.148]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:30:25.328 --> 02:30:30.253]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:30:30.473 --> 02:30:33.534]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:30:33.794 --> 02:30:37.655]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:30:37.855 --> 02:30:42.096]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:30:42.196 --> 02:30:52.159]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:30:52.419 --> 02:30:54.940]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:30:55.140 --> 02:31:03.212]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[02:31:10.382 --> 02:31:11.622]  Another major health threat.
[02:31:11.642 --> 02:31:16.544]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:31:16.604 --> 02:31:19.245]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:31:19.285 --> 02:31:26.067]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:31:26.327 --> 02:31:29.188]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:31:29.308 --> 02:31:32.269]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:31:32.349 --> 02:31:34.269]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:31:34.289 --> 02:31:37.130]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:31:37.210 --> 02:31:42.711]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:31:42.931 --> 02:31:46.412]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:31:46.432 --> 02:31:49.433]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:31:49.533 --> 02:31:56.634]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[02:32:10.529 --> 02:32:14.032]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:32:14.192 --> 02:32:18.155]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:32:18.456 --> 02:32:19.917]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:32:20.237 --> 02:32:27.824]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:32:28.104 --> 02:32:28.945]  But for how long?

[02:32:35.890 --> 02:32:38.713]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:32:40.074 --> 02:32:41.094]  DNA Force.
[02:32:41.154 --> 02:32:44.355]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:32:44.436 --> 02:32:45.456]  DNA Force.
[02:32:45.576 --> 02:32:53.599]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:32:53.739 --> 02:32:58.780]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:32:58.820 --> 02:32:59.821]  DNA Force.
[02:32:59.861 --> 02:33:01.741]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:33:16.496 --> 02:33:26.784]  The Preacher Man says... The Preacher Man says it's the end of time, in the Mississippi River she's a-goin' dry.
[02:33:27.505 --> 02:33:31.948]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:31.968 --> 02:33:37.713]  Interest is up and the stock market's down, and you're only gettin' mugged if you go downtown.
[02:33:43.083 --> 02:33:46.785]  Not for long, they're gonna put you in a little compact coffin apartment.
[02:33:46.805 --> 02:33:50.267]  We're gonna stop you from having that shotgun.
[02:33:50.628 --> 02:33:52.329]  Only the government can have that, and all the armed guards.
[02:33:52.349 --> 02:33:54.910]  If you want it, something's wrong with you.
[02:34:08.863 --> 02:34:11.605]  I can plow a field all day long.
[02:34:11.685 --> 02:34:15.088]  I can catch catfish from dusk till dawn.
[02:34:15.188 --> 02:34:18.131]  But if you don't plant Monsanto corn, they're gonna come after you.
[02:34:20.072 --> 02:34:22.875]  We make our own whiskey and our own smoke too.
[02:34:22.895 --> 02:34:25.637]  Ain't too many things these old boys can do.
[02:34:25.697 --> 02:34:28.179]  Until the television dishes got put out there on the back 40.
[02:34:30.877 --> 02:34:35.561]  Just sit in the trailer and watch television.
[02:34:35.681 --> 02:34:37.883]  You don't go duck hunting.
[02:34:38.063 --> 02:34:44.749]  You don't go feed the hogs while you watch television and Duck Dynasty do it.
[02:34:45.229 --> 02:34:50.193]  Of course, you don't fight the enemy here at home.
[02:34:50.673 --> 02:34:52.955]  You go and fight the ISIS the government created.
[02:35:02.682 --> 02:35:09.086]  We came from the West Virginia coal mines and the rocky mountains and the western skies.
[02:35:11.007 --> 02:35:13.069]  Dr. Stan Monteith passed away this morning.
[02:35:14.036 --> 02:35:15.036]  He's a really good friend of mine.
[02:35:15.656 --> 02:35:18.957]  I've been on his radio show for at least 18 years as a guest.
[02:35:19.557 --> 02:35:21.638]  He's been on my radio show since about 1997.
[02:35:22.418 --> 02:35:26.559]  So close to that, I interviewed him for a few years until I got on air a few years.
[02:35:27.419 --> 02:35:30.280]  And he died after a two-plus year battle with cancer.
[02:35:30.300 --> 02:35:34.801]  Didn't even tell anybody about it until about the last year, why he wasn't on the air a lot.
[02:35:35.162 --> 02:35:36.442]  Had fill-in guests and others.
[02:35:37.568 --> 02:35:53.493]  But he's gone now and all I can say is he was a very classy person and the amount of intel he put out and how much information went out like ripples from the water when you throw a rock into it from him is mind-blowing.
[02:35:57.714 --> 02:36:07.177]  And it makes me feel so humble about the position we have that reaches even more people every day standing on his shoulders, the shoulders of giants.
[02:36:08.507 --> 02:36:19.532]  And that's why I don't want to be thanked, because I think of how much better job I should be doing with this type of firepower in our hands, at our disposal.
[02:36:19.672 --> 02:36:24.935]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, The Nightly News, this radio show.
[02:36:25.235 --> 02:36:27.896]  We've all got to realize how epic this fight is.
[02:36:27.916 --> 02:36:32.098]  And I'm talking to my reporters, I'm talking to the crew, everybody.
[02:36:33.021 --> 02:36:35.802]  Myself included, and realize we shouldn't take this for granted.
[02:36:36.122 --> 02:36:40.544]  We shouldn't imagine that any of us will be here tomorrow, that InfoWars will be here next month.
[02:36:41.424 --> 02:36:44.505]  InfoWars has never been bigger, never been stronger, never been more successful.
[02:36:44.725 --> 02:36:46.046]  But never had more enemies.
[02:36:46.906 --> 02:36:48.167]  Never had more dirty tricks.
[02:36:48.187 --> 02:36:50.848]  Never had more enemies coming out of the woodwork.
[02:36:52.208 --> 02:36:53.409]  Like roaches at midnight.
[02:36:55.309 --> 02:36:56.210]  In an old restaurant.
[02:36:57.650 --> 02:37:00.151]  Because the enemy is making their move.
[02:37:00.511 --> 02:37:02.592]  Mordor is launching their attack.
[02:37:04.138 --> 02:37:05.099]  This is just the beginning.
[02:37:05.579 --> 02:37:08.020]  I told you a few years ago, I said, just wait, all hell's gonna break loose.
[02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:18.926]  Civil war, staged uprisings, messing with Russia, China, domestic police state, false flag, radical jihadi wind-up toys, like Alton Nolan.
[02:37:19.046 --> 02:37:22.728]  I mean, major evidence he was being radicalized, probably by criminal elements of the government.
[02:37:22.748 --> 02:37:29.471]  You can pull up the New York Times saying almost every terror plot has been hatched by the government, and I bet money this guy's a wind-up toy.
[02:37:29.511 --> 02:37:30.652]  He just fits the whole M.O.
[02:37:32.705 --> 02:37:40.389]  But the plan got foiled, the wind-up toy got killed by somebody, or got wounded by somebody, with a handgun.
[02:37:42.610 --> 02:37:45.292]  There it is, terrorist plots hatched by the FBI, New York Times.
[02:37:46.092 --> 02:37:47.593]  It goes on to say almost all of them.
[02:37:51.135 --> 02:37:53.196]  They go out and find mentally ill people, wind them up.
[02:37:54.637 --> 02:37:59.920]  Turns out a lot of the Islamists' mosque leaders are allowed to say all this stuff in England and here, call for violence.
[02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:01.901]  They're being funded and allowed to radicalize.
[02:38:03.467 --> 02:38:05.848]  Not to even track people back to their home countries.
[02:38:05.948 --> 02:38:08.888]  No, they're being armed over there, but as a destabilization force.
[02:38:09.268 --> 02:38:10.729]  Look, the border is wide open.
[02:38:11.109 --> 02:38:18.250]  So I want to be clear, this threat is real, but it's like dumping a bunch of black widows in your neighbor's bed.
[02:38:19.590 --> 02:38:22.711]  Did you order the black widows to be the most venomous spider in North America?
[02:38:23.571 --> 02:38:25.412]  Did you order the black widows to bite them?
[02:38:25.512 --> 02:38:26.552]  No, you just put them in the bed.
[02:38:28.354 --> 02:38:33.276]  So you are an accomplice because of the premeditation of it.
[02:38:33.556 --> 02:38:39.639]  And it's par for the course that you don't get promoted in these agencies unless you go out and do these things.
[02:38:42.180 --> 02:38:44.602]  And then the argument's, well, it gets us the funding to fight real threats.
[02:38:44.682 --> 02:38:45.342]  It's a simulant.
[02:38:47.283 --> 02:38:49.364]  I don't think it was simulated that the lady's head's getting chopped off.
[02:38:49.384 --> 02:38:53.646]  Now, again, we can't prove that yet, but there's Facebook and him operating and everything else.
[02:38:54.827 --> 02:38:59.009]  The fact that they could get him to do this in six months, I've said this over and over again, hypothetically I would never do it.
[02:39:00.489 --> 02:39:15.075]  I could go out and find schizophrenic or mentally ill or borderline personality disorder people, tell them what they want to hear, mentally ill, you name it, and I mean in a matter of days I could have them do whatever I wanted.
[02:39:17.016 --> 02:39:17.977]  And that's what the government does.
[02:39:20.237 --> 02:39:21.258]  And it's despicable.
[02:39:22.718 --> 02:39:23.719]  It's truly despicable.
[02:39:25.197 --> 02:39:26.598]  And see, this starts the whole narrative.
[02:39:26.638 --> 02:39:28.559]  Oh my gosh, the Muslim terrorists are hiding everywhere.
[02:39:28.819 --> 02:39:29.640]  Give up all your liberties.
[02:39:30.720 --> 02:39:41.627]  Here is the intro to, in about a little nine-minute speech, Dr. Monteith was there to hear me speak a few years ago in Santa Cruz to the listeners of KSCO, Michael's Whirling's Fine group of stations.
[02:39:41.647 --> 02:39:42.888]  He has a few stations there.
[02:39:46.212 --> 02:39:47.753]  I said, hey, will you please get up here and speak?
[02:39:47.793 --> 02:39:48.914]  And he said, oh, I really don't want to.
[02:39:48.934 --> 02:39:49.595]  And I said, please.
[02:39:50.235 --> 02:39:51.356]  And so he gave a short speech.
[02:39:51.676 --> 02:39:52.857]  He did die again this morning.
[02:39:53.277 --> 02:39:59.802]  And we're going to be putting a compilation together for Friday of some of his most important interviews and work and some of our video interviews with him.
[02:40:01.403 --> 02:40:12.993]  Show some of those never-before-seen with Dr. Stan Monteith and some of these interviews he's so sick he can barely talk but it's important information that he's putting out there really trying to impart to people the knowledge.
[02:40:13.353 --> 02:40:17.857]  Let's go ahead and go to some of this speech from a few years ago in Santa Cruz.
[02:40:22.148 --> 02:40:40.149]  Back in the late 1950s when people demonized you and attacked you a hundred times more than they attacked me, because all this stuff's coming true now, this guy was an icon who stood up against us and he does four or five hours of radio every day warning the planet.
[02:40:40.689 --> 02:40:48.533]  And so I wanted, I know most of you know him, but I came to here, not just you and not just to give a speech, but to talk to Dr. Stan Monti.
[02:40:48.733 --> 02:41:02.499]  So I wanted to spend 15-20 minutes crystallizing the fact that he's seen this huge awakening in where society's going and for us to count the cost and decide which side of this equation we're on.
[02:41:02.519 --> 02:41:04.379]  Liberty or tyranny!
[02:41:10.886 --> 02:41:12.447]  You got the floor, you take it away.
[02:41:12.908 --> 02:41:18.334]  Well, I'm not going to take very long because I think that Alex really is doing the most amazing job.
[02:41:18.374 --> 02:41:25.402]  You know, I've been at this for 48 years now, but I've never seen as much enthusiasm as I've seen in the last few years.
[02:41:26.122 --> 02:41:28.865]  And things are getting worse and worse.
[02:41:28.905 --> 02:41:31.888]  Now don't believe them when they tell you that things are going to get better.
[02:41:32.269 --> 02:41:34.070]  That the housing market is going to stabilize.
[02:41:34.151 --> 02:41:34.691]  No, it's not.
[02:41:35.071 --> 02:41:41.358]  The housing market is going to continue to fall and more and more people are going to continue losing their homes.
[02:41:41.398 --> 02:41:42.599]  The jobs are coming back.
[02:41:43.080 --> 02:41:44.821]  The jobs are not coming back.
[02:41:44.882 --> 02:41:47.724]  They've been sent overseas and they're going to stay there.
[02:41:48.665 --> 02:41:49.786]  Why are they going to stay there?
[02:41:50.486 --> 02:41:51.807]  Because there is a plan.
[02:41:52.368 --> 02:41:55.670]  Now, most people really don't know what the plan is, but it's called globalism.
[02:41:56.090 --> 02:42:10.039]  It's an organized effort to lower the living standards in the United States and raise the living standards throughout the world so we can have a one world government, a one world religion, and a one world ruler.
[02:42:10.579 --> 02:42:23.829]  Now, if you want to document this, it's all in something called the Earth Charter, written by Stephen Rockefeller, the nephew of David Rockefeller, by Mikhail Gorbachev, and by Marie Strong.
[02:42:24.590 --> 02:42:29.574]  And there in point 10A of the Earth Charter, they say, we're going to have equitable distribution of wealth.
[02:42:30.314 --> 02:42:31.694]  Between nations.
[02:42:32.455 --> 02:42:34.395]  Now, how do you get equitable distribution of wealth?
[02:42:34.735 --> 02:42:36.316]  Between the United States and China?
[02:42:36.836 --> 02:42:43.898]  Why, you lower living standards in the United States, and you raise living standards in China, and in India, and all throughout the world.
[02:42:44.398 --> 02:42:51.500]  And this is really what's happening that they cannot tell the American people, because most of you are so selfish, you don't want to give up your hand.
[02:42:52.141 --> 02:42:53.664]  You don't want to give up your pension.
[02:42:54.065 --> 02:42:59.275]  You don't want to give up your Social Security and your Medicare benefits and all the wonderful things that we have in this country.
[02:42:59.295 --> 02:43:02.562]  But you must understand, ladies and gentlemen, the America we have known.
[02:43:03.499 --> 02:43:04.680]  It has ceased to exist.
[02:43:05.020 --> 02:43:07.161]  It will never exist again during our lifetime.
[02:43:07.521 --> 02:43:11.223]  But the one thing we can hope is that we're going to be able to preserve an element of freedom.
[02:43:11.984 --> 02:43:14.965]  Now, how are they sending our jobs overseas?
[02:43:14.985 --> 02:43:19.788]  Well, it's a process known as offshoring manufacturing.
[02:43:20.528 --> 02:43:22.970]  And what we do is we take a manufacturer and we say,
[02:43:24.202 --> 02:43:28.245]  You're paying 35% corporate income tax in the United States.
[02:43:28.966 --> 02:43:31.868]  How you'd like to not have to pay any taxes at all?
[02:43:32.528 --> 02:43:34.289]  You move your factory over to China.
[02:43:34.650 --> 02:43:36.331]  You don't have to pay any corporate taxes.
[02:43:36.351 --> 02:43:37.692]  You can keep that money.
[02:43:37.712 --> 02:43:39.173]  You can invest it throughout the world.
[02:43:39.473 --> 02:43:42.035]  You can set up new manufacturing in all sorts of country.
[02:43:42.636 --> 02:43:49.060]  How many of you here, if you were offered that opportunity to make hundreds of millions of dollars, wouldn't take the opportunity?
[02:43:49.120 --> 02:43:51.022]  And that's what our great corporations are doing.
[02:43:51.662 --> 02:43:53.744]  Furthermore, they get abundant labor.
[02:43:53.764 --> 02:43:55.265]  There's all sorts of labor over there.
[02:43:55.405 --> 02:43:56.566]  Cheap labor.
[02:43:56.606 --> 02:43:59.808]  They don't have to put up with the bureaucracy, the harassment they have here.
[02:44:00.249 --> 02:44:07.855]  They do not have to actually pay unemployment insurance, workman's compensation insurance, FICA taxes.
[02:44:08.715 --> 02:44:10.477]  They're actually given loans.
[02:44:10.557 --> 02:44:12.178]  You can get a loan if you go over there.
[02:44:12.698 --> 02:44:17.182]  We're doing everything we can to encourage our corporations to move overseas.
[02:44:18.275 --> 02:44:22.741]  And of course, the reason they do that is because they can bring their products back here because we don't have taxes.
[02:44:23.362 --> 02:44:26.165]  What we need to do, of course, is to protect our economy.
[02:44:26.866 --> 02:44:30.370]  Yes, it'd be nice to help the rest of the world, but first of all, we've got to save America.
[02:44:30.671 --> 02:44:33.855]  And anybody who talks about tariffs now is called a...
[02:44:35.670 --> 02:44:37.072]  Oh, you're a protectionist.
[02:44:37.552 --> 02:44:38.333]  Why don't you know?
[02:44:38.794 --> 02:44:42.898]  If we put up tariffs, why would we have all sorts of people out of work?
[02:44:43.659 --> 02:44:46.903]  If we put up tariffs, we'd have tremendous trade deficits.
[02:44:47.563 --> 02:44:49.385]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have people out of work.
[02:44:49.806 --> 02:44:51.548]  The real unemployment is not 9.6%.
[02:44:51.788 --> 02:44:52.569]  It's close to 20%.
[02:44:56.092 --> 02:45:07.215]  If you use the U6 unemployment figures, which are put out by Bureau of Labor Statistics, but never mentioned by the controlled medium, and then you take away the birth-death ratio, it comes up to over 20%.
[02:45:08.376 --> 02:45:12.657]  If you calculate unemployment today, as they did during the Great Depression, over 20%?
[02:45:13.677 --> 02:45:15.678]  How many times have you heard that from Us Limbaugh?
[02:45:16.465 --> 02:45:20.269]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, you have to understand, number one, the press is controlled in America.
[02:45:20.289 --> 02:45:23.252]  It's controlled by five or six great corporations.
[02:45:24.072 --> 02:45:28.036]  Ninety percent of the press is controlled through interlocking directorates.
[02:45:28.557 --> 02:45:33.461]  And we're talking about Time Warner, Bertelsmann, which is a European corporation,
[02:45:34.382 --> 02:45:45.390]  Viacom, which runs CBS, Disney, which runs ABC, Fox, which runs the Wall Street Journal and Fox News, that's Rupert Murdoch, and then of course the sixth is Comcast.
[02:45:45.430 --> 02:45:49.333]  They just bought up General Electric, and probably just bought up NBC.
[02:45:50.133 --> 02:45:53.436]  Most people don't understand that literally all
[02:45:54.376 --> 02:46:01.943]  The major news magazines and major newspapers and major networks are intertwined in what I call the Brotherhood of Darkness.
[02:46:02.784 --> 02:46:09.490]  Intertwining in the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, and all these things that Alex talks about and he's talked to you many times about.
[02:46:10.270 --> 02:46:11.852]  But they have an organized program.
[02:46:12.708 --> 02:46:13.869]  to destroy this country.
[02:46:14.589 --> 02:46:16.931]  Now, first of all, you offshore our manufacturing.
[02:46:17.411 --> 02:46:18.612]  Eight million jobs are gone.
[02:46:18.752 --> 02:46:20.353]  They're not coming back again.
[02:46:20.393 --> 02:46:22.494]  They're outsourcing our jobs.
[02:46:22.574 --> 02:46:34.962]  And that means, of course, Obama recently gave $23 million to an educational facility over in India to teach Indians how to speak better English so they can have our answering system.
[02:46:35.382 --> 02:46:46.886]  Jobs over there, and we can move our answering services overseas, because they can do our architecture, they can do our engineering, they can read our CT scans and CAT scans and all those sorts of things, medical.
[02:46:46.906 --> 02:46:59.209]  I mean, in fact, there are between 25 and 42 million jobs that can leave America and be done just as well overseas, according to Dr. Alan Binder, who's a professor of economics at Princeton.
[02:46:59.949 --> 02:47:01.090]  What they're talking about
[02:47:01.977 --> 02:47:03.818]  It's impoverishing the American people.
[02:47:04.438 --> 02:47:09.961]  They're encouraging people to come in from other countries, well-trained people with H-1B visas, who work for much less.
[02:47:10.561 --> 02:47:13.543]  They're refusing to enforce our immigration laws.
[02:47:13.563 --> 02:47:13.863]  Why?
[02:47:13.903 --> 02:47:19.125]  Because they want the illegal immigrants to come in, so that we'll work for less and drive down our wages.
[02:47:19.165 --> 02:47:21.206]  Now, right now, people aren't hurting too badly.
[02:47:21.286 --> 02:47:23.647]  I mean, we've got unemployment insurance.
[02:47:24.128 --> 02:47:26.269]  It's been extended out to two years.
[02:47:26.289 --> 02:47:28.470]  You get 50% of what you were making before.
[02:47:29.330 --> 02:47:32.293]  But what happens when the federal government runs out of money?
[02:47:32.913 --> 02:47:34.855]  You can't keep borrowing money.
[02:47:35.716 --> 02:47:45.985]  And eventually what happens, and of course we're going to see this within about 10 years, is that they'll be putting out certainly more for insurance on the national debt.
[02:47:46.885 --> 02:47:53.929]  And for Social Security and Medicare, then all the money that comes in, there won't be anything left over for unemployment insurance, there won't be anything left over for the military.
[02:47:54.490 --> 02:47:57.591]  All of these programs, these wonderful programs, are going to come to an end.
[02:47:58.432 --> 02:48:00.493]  And that's exactly what they want.
[02:48:01.273 --> 02:48:02.034]  Who are they?
[02:48:02.274 --> 02:48:03.575]  Well, they're the Trilateral Commission.
[02:48:04.175 --> 02:48:13.700]  All you need to do, of course, is go back and read what Perry Goldwater told us back in 1979 in his book, No Apologies, when he said, this group is international.
[02:48:13.720 --> 02:48:14.241]  Their goal,
[02:48:14.941 --> 02:48:15.622]  We're good to go.
[02:48:28.715 --> 02:48:38.122]  Every President and or Vice President of the United States came from the membership rolls of the 87 members of the North American chapter of the Trilateral Commission.
[02:48:38.142 --> 02:48:40.404]  Do you think that happened by accident?
[02:48:40.424 --> 02:48:45.848]  6 of the 8 Presidents of the World Bank who control the world finance came from this little group.
[02:48:47.029 --> 02:48:52.033]  8 of the 10 World Trade Representatives who determine our trade policies.
[02:48:52.053 --> 02:48:55.176]  7 of the 12 Secretaries of State and 9 of the Secretaries of Defense.
[02:48:55.416 --> 02:48:56.497]  They control our government.
[02:48:57.435 --> 02:49:00.316]  And Rush Limbaugh is never going to tell you.
[02:49:00.336 --> 02:49:01.997]  And Sean Hannity isn't going to tell you.
[02:49:02.738 --> 02:49:04.138]  And Glenn Beck isn't going to tell you.
[02:49:04.859 --> 02:49:05.919]  But Alex Jones will.
[02:49:15.494 --> 02:49:20.296]  Alex is on the radio locally here that Michael Swerdling has the courage to put him on.
[02:49:20.876 --> 02:49:22.197]  Alex is doing a great job.
[02:49:22.597 --> 02:49:23.257]  He's picking up.
[02:49:23.277 --> 02:49:24.297]  I mean, I'm not going to be around.
[02:49:24.377 --> 02:49:24.437]  I'm 81.
[02:49:24.517 --> 02:49:26.398]  I'm not going to be around that much longer.
[02:49:26.738 --> 02:49:30.860]  But it's great to know that we have people who are going to be able to stand up and tell the truth.
[02:49:32.335 --> 02:49:34.355]  Wow, and there's a little bit more of that speech.
[02:49:34.455 --> 02:49:38.056]  We'll air it on the Nightly News or later in the week, but what a sweetheart.
[02:49:38.976 --> 02:49:42.817]  And believe me, I don't want to be the only host on a big platform telling this stuff.
[02:49:42.857 --> 02:49:43.437]  It's dangerous.
[02:49:44.257 --> 02:49:48.298]  And now you do hear Glenn Beck talk about some of this and others, and that's good.
[02:49:48.858 --> 02:49:50.199]  I'm not in some competition here.
[02:49:50.879 --> 02:49:52.359]  I don't territorialize the truth.
[02:49:52.439 --> 02:49:53.599]  Man, I want out of this.
[02:49:54.460 --> 02:49:55.940]  I liken it to claustrophobia.
[02:49:57.452 --> 02:50:01.253]  The globalists, what they're doing, the evil, the things they're doing, I personally feel it.
[02:50:01.833 --> 02:50:03.973]  And I want to stop it.
[02:50:04.774 --> 02:50:13.976]  And so, we've lost a real warrior, and Dr. Stan Monteith, we love you buddy, you did a great job, you ran the race hard, you won it, you're a winner.
[02:50:14.676 --> 02:50:16.616]  Your family's got to be proud, we're all proud of you.
[02:50:16.656 --> 02:50:18.196]  Great job, Dr. Stan Monteith.
[02:50:18.757 --> 02:50:20.577]  We all salute you and we love you so much.
[02:50:20.917 --> 02:50:24.658]  Great job, and thanks for the last few years being so sick and still fighting so hard.
[02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:26.660]  You really did it all.
[02:50:26.940 --> 02:50:27.781]  Great stamina.
[02:50:27.801 --> 02:50:30.841]  Just a true warrior for justice and the little people.
[02:50:30.902 --> 02:50:31.542]  Thank you so much.
[02:50:31.582 --> 02:50:32.002]  We love you.
[02:50:32.262 --> 02:50:34.402]  Here's that Trilateral Commission quote by Barry Goldwater.
[02:50:34.743 --> 02:50:44.645]  The Trilateral Commission is international and is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political government of the United States.
[02:50:45.126 --> 02:50:53.488]  The Trilateral Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power, political, monetary, intellectual, and ecclesiastical.
[02:50:54.068 --> 02:50:55.389]  Yeah, they took over the churches too.
[02:50:55.969 --> 02:50:58.190]  The universities, the medical, the banking, everything.
[02:50:58.791 --> 02:51:01.492]  And they just so happen to be eugenicists, exterminists.
[02:51:02.653 --> 02:51:04.254]  You might want to find out what that means.
[02:51:04.654 --> 02:51:06.815]  The people running things want you and your family dead.
[02:51:07.556 --> 02:51:09.437]  They gotta kill your brain first, that'll get you ready.
[02:51:10.852 --> 02:51:11.812]  Our big story.
[02:51:12.073 --> 02:51:16.954]  Gun owners react as politicians continue to ban high-capacity magazines state by state.
[02:51:17.094 --> 02:51:19.996]  I think that these weapons ought to be stopped.

[02:51:44.064 --> 02:51:46.445]  Waiting while you acted like we didn't exist.
[02:51:46.605 --> 02:51:49.306]  Waiting for our chance to be taken seriously.
[02:51:49.486 --> 02:51:50.846]  The wait is over.

[02:53:15.657 --> 02:53:16.217]  Treasuries.
[02:53:16.437 --> 02:53:23.500]  At the end of 2008, the time of TARP, the national debt was at $11 trillion, gold trading around $850 per ounce.
[02:53:23.800 --> 02:53:29.462]  Close to 2012, the national debt exceeded $16.4 trillion, gold doubled to $1,600 per ounce.
[02:53:30.482 --> 02:53:33.463]  The $20 trillion threshold for the national debt is inevitable.
[02:53:33.703 --> 02:53:37.665]  Politicians in Washington have a ferocious appetite for spending and stimulus.
[02:53:37.825 --> 02:53:40.106]  What's worse, a printing press to finance.
[02:53:40.506 --> 02:53:46.149]  A hundred years ago, we had a gold standard to limit this madness, but now you have to adopt your own gold standard.
[02:53:46.289 --> 02:53:48.010]  Don't be fooled with paper promises.

[02:54:46.997 --> 02:54:48.198]  Syria to Obama.
[02:54:48.679 --> 02:54:51.421]  Their ministers come out and said quit arming ISIS terrorists.
[02:54:52.102 --> 02:54:52.362]  U.S.
[02:54:52.442 --> 02:54:55.264]  funding of militant groups fuels terrorism.
[02:54:55.324 --> 02:54:56.806]  Syria's foreign minister states.
[02:54:57.970 --> 02:55:02.931]  And of course the Saudi ambassador openly admits that it's about a toppling Assad and a cover for that.
[02:55:03.531 --> 02:55:08.472]  Hong Kong politicians fears mini Tiananmen Square in response to unrest.
[02:55:08.892 --> 02:55:12.093]  That just went up with Paul Joseph Watson minutes ago as well.
[02:55:12.173 --> 02:55:15.054]  And Adon Salazar posted an article minutes ago.
[02:55:15.394 --> 02:55:21.115]  Police urge residents to outfit homes with police-run surveillance cameras.
[02:55:21.135 --> 02:55:22.595]  1984 to keep you safe.
[02:55:23.195 --> 02:55:25.616]  A lot of police departments are saying buy guns and learn how to use them.
[02:55:25.676 --> 02:55:26.356]  That's the answer.
[02:55:28.442 --> 02:55:31.183]  But you don't want to go to this thing where it's a police-monitored camera.
[02:55:31.843 --> 02:55:35.924]  Because then it'll just be hooked into Homeland Security, and that might as well be space aliens.
[02:55:36.024 --> 02:55:39.005]  I mean, it's not your best interest, folks.
[02:55:39.045 --> 02:55:41.026]  You cannot trust the central government.
[02:55:41.106 --> 02:55:42.487]  It has been taken over.
[02:55:44.467 --> 02:55:46.868]  Man, I am just freaked out by Dr. Stan Monteith dying.
[02:55:47.348 --> 02:55:49.149]  I was really thinking about him this weekend.
[02:55:49.809 --> 02:55:52.710]  I was going to call Nico and say, let's get him back on if he's well enough.
[02:55:53.510 --> 02:55:55.511]  But I won't be getting him back on anytime soon.
[02:55:58.044 --> 02:55:58.924]  Not on this go-around.
[02:55:58.964 --> 02:56:00.625]  Maybe at the next level.
[02:56:00.645 --> 02:56:02.466]  I want to do a radio show.
[02:56:02.806 --> 02:56:03.967]  The next plane of existence.
[02:56:04.747 --> 02:56:06.168]  But I already talked about that.
[02:56:06.248 --> 02:56:10.030]  Nightly News is tonight, 7 o'clock central with Leanne McAdoo.
[02:56:10.470 --> 02:56:11.410]  She's hosting tonight.
[02:56:11.430 --> 02:56:14.092]  She's in there doing research right now for a bunch of big breaking stories.
[02:56:15.072 --> 02:56:17.653]  But, oh, is that our story up on Drudge?
[02:56:18.474 --> 02:56:18.814]  Interesting.
[02:56:18.874 --> 02:56:21.875]  So it's on the bottom of the middle column of DrudgeReport.com.
[02:56:22.396 --> 02:56:25.117]  Police urge residents to outfit homes with police-run surveillance cameras.
[02:56:25.657 --> 02:56:26.698]  Man, Drudge is so quick.
[02:56:27.418 --> 02:56:32.100]  That before I'd even refresh InfoWars and seen our own article 10 minutes ago, Drudge already has it up.
[02:56:33.121 --> 02:56:33.921]  That's incredible.
[02:56:34.601 --> 02:56:36.222]  Okay, I wish I could do that.
[02:56:36.282 --> 02:56:39.744]  I just, I tell you, I had a bunch of family stuff going on the last year.
[02:56:39.824 --> 02:56:40.684]  Deaths, you name it.
[02:56:40.724 --> 02:56:47.547]  Now, I got a family member very close to me that is real sick and it's just like when it rains, it pours.
[02:56:47.567 --> 02:56:48.348]  I'm not complaining.
[02:56:48.388 --> 02:56:48.648]  I just...
[02:56:49.915 --> 02:56:54.017]  People dying in your family or being deathly ill just really are having major problems.
[02:56:54.037 --> 02:56:57.359]  Just as a way of, one of the few things that gets me not thinking about work.
[02:56:58.099 --> 02:57:02.321]  I'm still thinking about it like 12 hours a day, but man, I just, I'm not complaining either.
[02:57:02.381 --> 02:57:04.362]  I just, I'm like, man, it's a certain point.
[02:57:05.603 --> 02:57:06.263]  Certain point.
[02:57:06.823 --> 02:57:09.084]  There's times in history where everything happens at once, isn't there?
[02:57:09.865 --> 02:57:11.586]  And this is certainly one of those times.
[02:57:13.749 --> 02:57:14.469]  Here's an article.
[02:57:14.870 --> 02:57:17.671]  Huge plunge in kindergartners vaccination rates.
[02:57:17.871 --> 02:57:20.693]  Officials stumped why people aren't getting the vaccines.
[02:57:21.394 --> 02:57:24.675]  And the new data shows people not getting vaccinated has grown by 414%.
[02:57:24.996 --> 02:57:27.737]  It's because people don't trust you anymore.
[02:57:29.678 --> 02:57:31.079]  The system isn't trusted.
[02:57:31.119 --> 02:57:32.100]  That's on InfoWars.
[02:57:33.661 --> 02:57:36.042]  Briefly, to close out this transmission, I'll be back tomorrow.
[02:57:36.062 --> 02:57:36.803]  We'll be taking calls.
[02:57:36.863 --> 02:57:38.544]  Ron Paul, Jesse Ventura, and others join us.
[02:57:39.349 --> 02:57:40.470]  I want to say great job to the crew.
[02:57:41.050 --> 02:57:50.977]  We really have produced what I believe are some of the best hard-hitting, not-fillered, real-deal, key-missing-link type vaccines.
[02:57:52.390 --> 02:57:52.930]  Vaccines.
[02:57:53.530 --> 02:57:57.132]  Natural, you know, body systems to counter all the vaccines and the rest of it.
[02:57:57.152 --> 02:57:58.572]  I was thinking about vaccines.
[02:58:00.533 --> 02:58:01.013]  Supplements.
[02:58:02.214 --> 02:58:06.895]  And we've got DNA Force back in, the flagship product.
[02:58:07.436 --> 02:58:10.497]  X2, Super Nation, True Nation Iodine.
[02:58:11.357 --> 02:58:13.618]  Turns bright blue on paper, not black or red, folks.
[02:58:13.698 --> 02:58:14.399]  This is a real deal.
[02:58:14.639 --> 02:58:15.299]  Pure crystals.
[02:58:15.699 --> 02:58:17.320]  Turn into gas and inject it into it.
[02:58:17.861 --> 02:58:19.281]  I mean, it's just, nobody does this.
[02:58:19.341 --> 02:58:20.502]  I'm not bragging, it's just fact.
[02:58:20.942 --> 02:58:23.023]  Super male vitality, super female vitality.
[02:58:23.984 --> 02:58:25.805]  They've bombarded us with estrogen mimickers.
[02:58:25.825 --> 02:58:28.787]  This just lets your glands operate naturally, according to what groups said.
