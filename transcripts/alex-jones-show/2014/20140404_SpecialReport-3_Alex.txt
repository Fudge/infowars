[00:00:06.684 --> 00:00:19.193]  We're here at Big Bend National Park, and everywhere we see lessons that are applicable in Mother Nature, but also in human interactions with bullies.
[00:00:19.213 --> 00:00:28.159]  And when I'm talking about bullies, I'm talking about government itself, historically the biggest bully and the largest danger to human populations.
[00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:35.945]  Of course, the University of Hawaii did a big study about it a decade or so ago, finding that government conservatively killed in non-military related deaths
[00:00:37.985 --> 00:00:45.087]  262 million people in the 20th century and government is already online in the 21st century to break that record.
[00:00:46.287 --> 00:00:47.587]  Now what does that have to do with Big Bend?
[00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:48.667]  I'll tell you right now.
[00:00:49.127 --> 00:00:49.528]  Look at this.
[00:00:51.388 --> 00:00:52.188]  Lion warning.
[00:00:53.088 --> 00:00:56.669]  A lion has been frequenting this area and could be aggressive towards humans.
[00:00:57.169 --> 00:01:05.871]  If you see a lion, pick up small children, stand together, appear large, wave arms, shout aggressively, throw stones or sticks, report sightings to a ranger.
[00:01:06.738 --> 00:01:10.081]  Do not show fear, crouch down, run away.
[00:01:11.482 --> 00:01:13.124]  So there you go ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:13.724 --> 00:01:20.010]  When humans act aggressive and defend their private property and are armed
[00:01:21.243 --> 00:01:25.046]  Predators, whether they're bullies or mountain lions, whatever the case is, don't come after you.
[00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:34.913]  When you grovel, like to the TSA, and bow down, and someone in a uniform becomes God, that's the essence of North Korea, the essence of Mexico, the essence of tyranny.
[00:01:35.293 --> 00:01:42.558]  A TSA agent was arrested on January 3rd and was behaving erratically, saying, I am God, I'm in charge.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.182]  And so the answer is to
[00:01:49.096 --> 00:01:58.761]  Be basically a noble savage who's into science and technology and is informed, but at the same time retains your human instinct to not be a prey animal, but to quite frankly be a predator.
[00:01:59.981 --> 00:02:04.223]  That's what's happening as subgroups of humans in government are engaged in predator activity on us.
[00:02:04.263 --> 00:02:04.904]  That's called tyranny.
[00:02:05.364 --> 00:02:11.047]  We're supposed to form family units, cultural units that defend each other and build a better civilization.
[00:02:11.874 --> 00:02:18.160]  Based on Renaissance, art, literature, not based on the rule of the thug.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.785]  So next time tyrants are in your face, don't show fear, don't crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you.
[00:02:24.065 --> 00:02:25.446]  Don't bow down, don't run away.
[00:02:25.967 --> 00:02:26.467]  Stand up.
[00:02:26.867 --> 00:02:28.128]  Stand together as communities.
[00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:31.391]  That's why they're destroying families, that's why they're playing men and women off against each other.
[00:02:31.772 --> 00:02:32.512]  That is the plan.
[00:02:33.293 --> 00:02:34.434]  So come together, folks.
[00:02:34.955 --> 00:02:35.235]  Unity.
[00:02:36.434 --> 00:02:38.135]  I'm David Knight, reporting for InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:02:38.175 --> 00:02:41.537]  Just before I left for Austin, I took my family to the Smoky Mountains.
[00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:07.815]  Now, long before the Europeans named it the Smoky Mountains, the Cherokee had a name for it.
[00:03:07.935 --> 00:03:11.217]  And if I pronounce it correctly, it's something like, Shaakonokwe.
[00:03:11.897 --> 00:03:14.739]  Which means, Place of the Fine Particulate Smog.
[00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:16.099]  No, not actually.
[00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:18.040]  That's what the EPA wants you to think.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.903]  I was surprised to see this graphic on EPA's site where they explain what PM 2.5 is.
[00:03:24.524 --> 00:03:26.765]  They use the Smoky Mountains as a poster child.
[00:03:27.425 --> 00:03:32.308]  Is it really PM 2.5 and man-made smog that makes the Smoky Mountains smoky?
[00:03:32.808 --> 00:03:32.928]  No.
[00:03:33.658 --> 00:03:39.884]  We all know that it isn't, but we see this kind of thing done over and over again, like they did with polar bears on ice flows.
[00:03:39.904 --> 00:03:40.365]  Remember that?
[00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:48.653]  And of course, Al Gore is telling us that the oceans are rising, but he builds his $9 million mansion in Montecito, California, right on the ocean side.
[00:03:49.274 --> 00:03:51.276]  So I don't think he believes that either.
[00:03:51.916 --> 00:03:55.199]  But they use these subliminal messages to try to convince us.
[00:03:56.261 --> 00:03:57.522]  And they can be quite effective.
[00:03:58.215 --> 00:04:04.177]  Speaking of bears, every visitor to the Smoky Mountains gets a handout that looks like this, warning you about black bears.
[00:04:05.018 --> 00:04:12.901]  As my wife was reading that to the small children, I started thinking, a lot of the stuff they were saying about bears could be said about government, especially about the EPA.
[00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:15.002]  Let me just read a few things here.
[00:04:16.222 --> 00:04:20.084]  With aggressive behavior, the bear, the EPA, is demanding more space.
[00:04:20.882 --> 00:04:23.884]  If the bear, or EPA, continues to follow you, stand your ground.
[00:04:24.424 --> 00:04:26.226]  If the EPA gets closer, talk louder.
[00:04:26.426 --> 00:04:27.106]  Or shout at it.
[00:04:27.366 --> 00:04:28.147]  Act aggressively.
[00:04:28.487 --> 00:04:30.468]  Act together as a group if you have companions.
[00:04:30.688 --> 00:04:33.150]  Make yourself look as large as possible.
[00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.910]  Don't run.
[00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:34.891]  Don't turn away.
[00:04:34.911 --> 00:04:37.012]  And don't feed the EPA.
[00:04:37.753 --> 00:04:39.294]  It only encourages further problems.
[00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.152]  David Knight for InfoWars Nightly News.
