[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.770]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:23.762 --> 00:00:26.326]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:42.082 --> 00:00:43.803]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:44.704 --> 00:00:47.846]  Crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:50.688]  Folks, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:50.768 --> 00:00:51.149]  I'm here.
[00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:53.250]  Thank you for joining us on Thanksgiving.
[00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.132]  And no, I'm not live.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.621]  But I am recording this on the eve of Thanksgiving.
[00:00:58.661 --> 00:01:01.502]  We have some powerful rebroadcast coming up.
[00:01:02.322 --> 00:01:08.944]  I'm going to tape some more in the next segment on some key issues, but Phyllis Schlafly about what the Open Borders is really all about.
[00:01:09.424 --> 00:01:11.005]  That was a powerful interview from a month ago.
[00:01:11.025 --> 00:01:11.785]  That's going to re-air.
[00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:14.806]  Then the Freeway Rick Ross interview is going to air.
[00:01:15.286 --> 00:01:25.029]  As of taping, Rick Ross, the rapper, one of the top rappers in the world, who has hundreds of millions of fans, the fake Rick Ross, has responded to Freeway Rick Ross
[00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:31.072]  And that video that we shot with him has gotten millions of views and is on BET, CNN, you name it.
[00:01:31.432 --> 00:01:49.521]  So it shows how we're crashing through the lies and disinformation, getting into pop culture that's normally the weapon system of the globalist, and trying to turn hip-hop, that's turning to gangster rap, into a tool to enlighten and awaken people to the New World Order, to not be part of the thug culture.
[00:01:51.162 --> 00:01:54.324]  You see, I give thanks on Thanksgiving.
[00:01:55.928 --> 00:01:59.190]  For all the great people that have stood up for liberty and freedom.
[00:01:59.891 --> 00:02:02.933]  And I give thanks for you, the listeners, and all that you've done.
[00:02:02.953 --> 00:02:05.334]  It's simply been humbling.
[00:02:07.055 --> 00:02:11.598]  I fight tyrants because they make me mad at a fundamental level and my instinct is to resist them.
[00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:13.619]  Just as you do as well.
[00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.524]  And so no matter whether you're black, white, hispanic, asian, old, young, a muslim, a christian, or even an agnostic,
[00:02:21.798 --> 00:02:31.440]  If you don't want to be a slave, and if you want to be free, and if you like to see others succeed, and you're not a hater, then we're all brothers and sisters together.
[00:02:31.841 --> 00:02:34.921]  And that's really the unifying issue here.
[00:02:37.002 --> 00:02:41.023]  But they take our brotherly love, our sisterly love, that Bob Marley talked about,
[00:02:42.338 --> 00:02:53.167]  And they use that to get us to then do suicidal things like bring in unlimited illegals who are unskilled, who can be politically molded into socialists to complete our journey to slavery.
[00:02:53.207 --> 00:03:01.634]  So we have to have tough love as well and really know how the world works so that they don't use our good intentions against us.
[00:03:01.674 --> 00:03:02.494]  Because it's really true.
[00:03:02.514 --> 00:03:05.957]  I used to hear the road to hell is paved with good intentions and I went, no.
[00:03:06.518 --> 00:03:09.180]  It's paved by evil people manipulating the gullible.
[00:03:10.862 --> 00:03:13.484]  Still, fundamentally, that statement's true, as I've gotten older.
[00:03:14.244 --> 00:03:15.385]  It is paved.
[00:03:16.846 --> 00:03:27.814]  The truck of tyranny, the train of tyranny, and its camp followers rolls down the road, but it is paved with, it's for the children.
[00:03:28.575 --> 00:03:30.736]  Or, oh, it's a social safety net.
[00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:36.080]  Or, oh, the banks will implode if we don't give them this bailout that was really a political takeover.
[00:03:37.588 --> 00:03:44.916]  The world is sophisticated, tyranny and evil hides behind that sophistication, but there is a veil being lifted right now across the world.
[00:03:45.437 --> 00:03:58.772]  People really are waking up, so the globalists, the social engineers are moving into trying to hijack awakenings and turn them towards their own plan for world government, an autocratic, computerized, technological technocracy.
[00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.712]  Or to quote Darth Vader, a technological terror that's been constructed to dehumanize.
[00:04:05.152 --> 00:04:15.295]  They're trying to sell the big plastic Zeitgeist prison, where the computers programmed by the globalists make all the decisions, as the great equalizer into the future.
[00:04:15.535 --> 00:04:16.596]  And we'll all get our 200 square foot
[00:04:18.136 --> 00:04:23.757]  prison dormitory homes and all be told what to eat and when to go to work and what we're going to be when we grow up.
[00:04:24.077 --> 00:04:25.518]  This is the end of free will.
[00:04:25.778 --> 00:04:30.839]  This is humans being turned into nothing but biological androids, as I've said so many times.
[00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:37.261]  And I stand for resisting that and believing in humanity and trying to build everyone up.
[00:04:37.761 --> 00:04:46.543]  So as the Democratic Party tries to fan the flames of the sad Ferguson Brown story to create a larger conflagration,
[00:04:47.904 --> 00:04:51.487]  It's important to realize that they have to divide us so they can conquer us.
[00:04:52.168 --> 00:04:54.010]  Does that mean the police state is a good thing?
[00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.690]  No, it's terrible.
[00:04:55.471 --> 00:04:58.053]  But just fighting with it won't defeat it.
[00:04:58.654 --> 00:05:02.297]  We have to reach out and point out the tyranny.
[00:05:03.522 --> 00:05:06.745]  And talk about alternatives to it and come together.
[00:05:07.126 --> 00:05:11.790]  That's how we'll really triumph with a velvet revolution of ideas, not of guns.
[00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.694]  But we should have the Second Amendment to defend ourselves as a backup.
[00:05:17.415 --> 00:05:18.816]  We'll be back straight ahead.
[00:05:20.441 --> 00:05:24.303]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[00:05:25.044 --> 00:05:31.288]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.
[00:05:31.408 --> 00:05:40.454]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior vitality in males and females.
[00:05:40.834 --> 00:05:45.657]  Supercharge and conquer your world at InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:50.322 --> 00:05:53.804]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:53.964 --> 00:05:57.927]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:58.247 --> 00:05:59.708]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:06:00.028 --> 00:06:05.051]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[00:06:05.352 --> 00:06:07.613]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[00:06:07.893 --> 00:06:08.734]  But for how long?
[00:06:09.034 --> 00:06:11.035]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com.
[00:06:11.235 --> 00:06:15.298]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L bodyarmor.com.
[00:06:15.678 --> 00:06:18.480]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:06:19.932 --> 00:06:24.214]  For months, the Infowars Live Silver Bullet colloidal silver has been completely sold out.
[00:06:24.475 --> 00:06:29.577]  Now, we have finally procured a limited supply from one of the leading manufacturers of nutraceuticals in the nation.
[00:06:29.697 --> 00:06:31.599]  But here's what's truly exciting.
[00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:42.024]  While we could simply sell the survival silver for its already discounted shelf price, we have decided to give back to you, the listeners, who make it all possible with a pre-Black Friday mega sale.
[00:06:42.164 --> 00:06:44.826]  We are launching this mega special with an unprecedented
[00:06:45.566 --> 00:06:49.549]  20% off and free shipping on all Silver Bullet across the board.
[00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:50.590]  All supplies last.
[00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:57.714]  And to help everyone stock up for the next shortage, when you buy four bottles of Silver Bullet, you'll receive the fifth one absolutely free.
[00:06:57.914 --> 00:07:00.896]  That's on top of the 20% off savings and free shipping.
[00:07:00.996 --> 00:07:05.179]  Finally, if supplies hold, we will extend this special out to Cyber Monday.
[00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:08.063]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've never done anything like this before.
[00:07:08.343 --> 00:07:13.910]  Find this mother of all specials and others I've not yet announced yet at InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:14.751]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.653]  On the eve of Thanksgiving this year, I was thinking, what am I really thankful for?
[00:07:23.833 --> 00:07:31.979]  And I gotta tell you, it's my family, it's all the blessings of liberty that our forebearers secured, and it's you, the listeners of the broadcast, who've made everything we do possible.
[00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:40.385]  This Black Friday, I decided to bring you the biggest special we've ever offered on any of the Nutraceuticals at Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:40.485 --> 00:07:44.268]  I'm talking about Silver Bullet colloidal silver that we've been sold out of for months.
[00:07:44.488 --> 00:07:46.389]  This time I doubled down and got even more.
[00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:50.190]  As of me taping this, on the eve of Thanksgiving, we have already sold half of them.
[00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:57.393]  So instead of keeping the price at its regular discounted price, we are going to give you 20% off and free shipping on single bottles.
[00:07:57.573 --> 00:08:00.975]  But if you get four bottles, we're gonna give you the fifth one free and the free shipping.
[00:08:01.115 --> 00:08:05.717]  I don't know how long this special will run, but if supplies last, we will extend it out until Cyber Monday.
[00:08:05.817 --> 00:08:11.439]  You'll find powerful nutraceuticals like Silver Bullet and others at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:08:11.459 --> 00:08:12.039]  Again, this is Alex
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:19.242]  Alex Jones, wishing you all a blessed and happy Thanksgiving, and thanking you all for your support of freedom.
[00:08:22.503 --> 00:08:28.565]  They took my saddle in Houston, broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[00:08:30.686 --> 00:08:36.668]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[00:08:36.688 --> 00:08:39.749]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[00:08:42.356 --> 00:08:44.437]  Rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:08:45.677 --> 00:08:47.018]  Monday through Friday 11 a.m.
[00:08:47.038 --> 00:08:47.398]  to 2 p.m.
[00:08:47.418 --> 00:08:47.758]  Central.
[00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:51.900]  Re-aired across fine stations throughout the United States.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.541]  Blasting out via the internet and global shortwave to the rest of the planet.
[00:08:57.902 --> 00:08:58.022]  Well...
[00:08:59.184 --> 00:09:02.027]  We're going to have some rebroadcast today here on Thanksgiving.
[00:09:02.067 --> 00:09:02.747]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:09:02.767 --> 00:09:05.430]  Phyllis Schlafly is coming up on the open border invasion.
[00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:12.777]  We have the Rick Ross interview that two weeks after we did it live is an international news story from BET to CNN.
[00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:15.439]  We took over the Rick Ross...
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:40.589]  Meme of the top rapper that uses the real Rick Ross's name, and we're reaching out to the whole gangster hip-hop community, explaining to them how it's all a CIA shy-op to create a thug culture, which we now see invading and taking over protests across the country, and the Democratic Party fanning the flames of that to create racial division to distract everybody from Obama's executive order operations.
[00:09:40.649 --> 00:09:43.150]  In fact, we played a clip yesterday on the show.
[00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.471]  Maybe we can cue it up right now.
[00:09:45.652 --> 00:09:54.977]  Where we have Obama coming out, if you can, it doesn't matter, guys, coming out and saying, hey, don't heckle me, I changed the law to legalize illegals.
[00:09:55.317 --> 00:09:56.438]  But even that isn't enough.
[00:09:57.018 --> 00:09:59.579]  Well, you can't just change laws with executive orders.
[00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:01.040]  Congress makes the laws.
[00:10:02.298 --> 00:10:03.959]  What am I thankful for on Thanksgiving?
[00:10:04.619 --> 00:10:07.480]  The fact that I am on the air rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.521]  It's very humbling.
[00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:10.402]  Know that I am very humble.
[00:10:10.502 --> 00:10:11.622]  I appreciate all of you.
[00:10:12.943 --> 00:10:17.605]  And we couldn't do it without all of you and the AM and FM affiliates and the sponsors.
[00:10:18.652 --> 00:10:21.494]  And the good Lord above and my family and the incredible crew.
[00:10:21.814 --> 00:10:29.640]  So I just want to say great job to the crew, everybody in there, Richard, Nico, CJ, everybody behind the scenes that makes it all possible.
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:30.641]  There's no way to thank them all.
[00:10:30.941 --> 00:10:34.243]  I want to thank all of you out there for your prayers as well.
[00:10:34.964 --> 00:10:36.525]  And I want to give something back.
[00:10:37.005 --> 00:10:37.566]  I mean, really.
[00:10:38.326 --> 00:10:45.412]  It's kind of a paradox, because you're giving to us to help fund the operation, but it's a win-win-win, because you also get high-quality products.
[00:10:45.992 --> 00:10:58.062]  We ran a special yesterday, and it's almost sold out, of the remaining colloidal silver bullet, where you can get four bottles with 20% off, and you can get free shipping on that, and a free bottle.
[00:10:58.943 --> 00:11:02.626]  Yeah, free bottle, free shipping, and 20% off the four bottles to begin with.
[00:11:04.116 --> 00:11:07.697]  And then on top of that, a single bottle is 20% off in free shipping.
[00:11:08.137 --> 00:11:09.217]  Unprecedented special.
[00:11:09.797 --> 00:11:10.578]  That's still running.
[00:11:10.918 --> 00:11:17.279]  We're running a Pro-Pure special today on the high-quality, gravity-fed water filters.
[00:11:17.819 --> 00:11:29.562]  Now get this, for 24 hours only, that's all you get authorization from the manufacturer, 50% off all new Pro-Pure Prepper series.
[00:11:31.923 --> 00:11:32.604]  percent off.
[00:11:32.724 --> 00:11:35.986]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com.
[00:11:36.006 --> 00:11:37.507]  There's a bunch of other specials up there.
[00:11:37.848 --> 00:11:39.689]  We've never had specials anywhere near this.
[00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:42.451]  It's our thanks to you on Thanksgiving.
[00:11:42.691 --> 00:11:45.834]  Here is Phyllis Schlafly on this holiday.
[00:11:48.015 --> 00:11:49.817]  But at the top, these are not leftists.
[00:11:50.737 --> 00:11:56.602]  These are deranged control freaks, more akin to what you saw in the French Revolution.
[00:11:57.585 --> 00:12:03.612]  The only behavior I've seen like this is in the French Revolution, if you study the degeneracy of the Jacobins and others.
[00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:05.434]  I don't want to go into a history lesson here.
[00:12:05.694 --> 00:12:06.795]  Phyllis Schlafly joins us.
[00:12:07.096 --> 00:12:07.877]  Thank you so much.
[00:12:07.937 --> 00:12:12.202]  I know you want to get into 2014 elections, what you think that really signified.
[00:12:12.722 --> 00:12:15.104]  The landscape, is it a big political realignment?
[00:12:15.224 --> 00:12:16.205]  I certainly think so.
[00:12:17.186 --> 00:12:22.350]  Can we defeat the establishment Republicans that will try to play ball with the same crony capitalist?
[00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:26.813]  Looking forward to 2016, what do you see in your crystal ball?
[00:12:27.073 --> 00:12:34.940]  We'll discuss it all today in the republishing of your book, Phyllis, but first off, we commend your 55 years of work for liberty.
[00:12:36.093 --> 00:12:44.845]  And we'd like to get your take on my little rant discussing the arrogance that we're seeing out of the so-called left right now.
[00:12:45.106 --> 00:12:48.150]  How would you characterize the mental state of these people?
[00:12:48.996 --> 00:12:51.536]  Well, thank you for all the kind words you said, Alex.
[00:12:51.656 --> 00:12:52.797]  It's good to be on with you.
[00:12:53.417 --> 00:12:54.937]  And you are right.
[00:12:55.617 --> 00:13:05.799]  They deserve a rant because they have really brought this country down the wrong path and the majority of Americans admitted we're going in the wrong way.
[00:13:06.539 --> 00:13:10.200]  And I think what they really want is power and money, our money.
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:17.601]  And they want to make sure that the government has control and makes the decisions for us.
[00:13:18.123 --> 00:13:27.767]  When I grew up, I guess it was years before you grew up, but we had a country of middle-class families who had intact nuclear families.
[00:13:27.827 --> 00:13:33.890]  That is, the mother and father were married to each other and raising their own children in one household.
[00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:39.152]  And now, that's just a minority of people in our country.
[00:13:39.987 --> 00:13:44.571]  But the nuclear family was the self-contained economic unit.
[00:13:44.611 --> 00:13:49.075]  They spent their own money, made their own decisions, decided how they were going to raise their children.
[00:13:49.916 --> 00:13:59.604]  And now we don't have that anymore, and you find the liberals who want to give us government control of everything.
[00:13:59.624 --> 00:14:07.751]  You know this speech that Obama made up in Rhode Island a couple of weeks ago, which he said, we just shouldn't allow women to have the choice
[00:14:08.559 --> 00:14:08.879]  Choice.
[00:14:08.939 --> 00:14:14.283]  He used the word choice of taking care of their own children or being in the workforce.
[00:14:14.983 --> 00:14:21.327]  Because we want them to be in the workforce so they pay more taxes so we can provide them with government child care and raise their children.
[00:14:23.746 --> 00:14:29.449]  And so first they sell the idea that a woman's not worthy if she doesn't have some job paying all these taxes.
[00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:34.152]  And great, if a woman wants a career, go be a constitutional lawyer, change the world like you've done, more power to them.
[00:14:34.612 --> 00:14:36.694]  If a man wants to stay home with the kids, more power to him.
[00:14:36.774 --> 00:14:40.076]  Or wants to go out and, you know, work at a factory or build a factory.
[00:14:40.276 --> 00:14:41.296]  I mean, that's free will.
[00:14:41.677 --> 00:14:47.020]  But the demonization of a maternal role and then now saying,
[00:14:48.126 --> 00:14:49.466]  Women just shouldn't have the choice.
[00:14:49.927 --> 00:14:55.088]  They should be made to go out into the system and let the state raise the children.
[00:14:55.448 --> 00:14:58.769]  That's what MSNBC has been saying in promos now for two years.
[00:14:59.589 --> 00:15:03.331]  Every week promos, they're saying, your kids belong to the state.
[00:15:03.831 --> 00:15:05.731]  They're really coming out of the closet, aren't they?
[00:15:06.091 --> 00:15:07.112]  They certainly are.
[00:15:07.132 --> 00:15:12.093]  And of course, when you go in the workforce, you're going to pay taxes.
[00:15:12.473 --> 00:15:17.635]  And that's going to give these bureaucrats more of your money to spend and tell you how to spend it.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:25.386]  Here's Melissa Harris Perry in an MSNBC promo saying that we got to get past the idea that your kids belong to you.
[00:15:25.826 --> 00:15:33.732]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:15:34.113 --> 00:15:39.097]  Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households, then we start making better investments.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.482]  Well, that's real straight to the left-wing heresy, yes.
[00:15:43.602 --> 00:15:45.724]  It's just absolutely wrong.
[00:15:46.644 --> 00:15:50.667]  Everything we know means children do better when they're raised by their own parents.
[00:15:51.028 --> 00:16:00.855]  In fact, you know, we poured all this money into public schools in an attempt to close the gap, those are the magic words, between the high-achieving and the low-achieving students.
[00:16:01.445 --> 00:16:04.611]  And they used to think the real cause of the gap was poverty.
[00:16:05.132 --> 00:16:08.037]  And now recent research shows it's really not poverty.
[00:16:08.437 --> 00:16:11.683]  It's whether or not the kids are raised by their own mother and father.
[00:16:12.324 --> 00:16:14.829]  And those who are, are going to do better in school.
[00:16:15.188 --> 00:16:20.949]  And of course they knew that in the social engineering, and that's why they've worked as hard as they can to break up the family.
[00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:22.970]  They know full well what they're doing.
[00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:23.930]  It's premeditated.
[00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:33.912]  What do you make of more and more Democrats and leftists coming out and admitting they lie, and admitting they deceive, and admitting they want to wreck the economy so they can be in control?
[00:16:34.693 --> 00:16:42.694]  I mean, for me, that is criminal fraud, to have people involved in Obamacare coming out and saying, we lied to Congress, we lied to the public.
[00:16:43.935 --> 00:16:44.855]  I mean, that's just outrageous.
[00:16:44.855 --> 00:16:49.776]  Well, you know, this case that the Supreme Court has just taken, it's really pretty funny.
[00:16:50.196 --> 00:16:51.597]  It's about Obamacare.
[00:16:52.257 --> 00:17:00.899]  And when the Obamacare said that you only got the subsidies if your exchange was set up by the state.
[00:17:01.339 --> 00:17:02.459]  Their words are very clear.
[00:17:02.479 --> 00:17:03.820]  They're not equivocal at all.
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:09.681]  And they want people to... But most of the states didn't sign up for it.
[00:17:10.473 --> 00:17:12.854]  And so the people want to get the subsidies anyway.
[00:17:13.354 --> 00:17:16.975]  And they're trying to get the Supreme Court to rewrite the legislation.
[00:17:17.655 --> 00:17:20.816]  Now, our Constitution says all legislative powers are in the Congress.
[00:17:20.856 --> 00:17:21.677]  It's very clear.
[00:17:21.697 --> 00:17:23.917]  There's nothing equivocal about it.
[00:17:24.778 --> 00:17:31.580]  And the Supreme Court is going to take that case, and the question is, are they going to stick to the way it was written, or are they going to rewrite it?
[00:17:32.691 --> 00:17:36.853]  Well, there's a real power struggle in American intelligency and the elites itself.
[00:17:36.893 --> 00:17:41.796]  For so long, the Republican bluebloods have worked with the left in this radical transformation.
[00:17:42.196 --> 00:17:52.421]  Now that we see that it's designed to wreck the country and fold us into global government, a lot of elites, who aren't completely criminal, are now trying to put the brakes on things.
[00:17:52.922 --> 00:17:56.543]  I know you have a lot of high-level contacts inside the system.
[00:17:57.104 --> 00:17:59.165]  Do you think that's an accurate statement that there is
[00:18:02.007 --> 00:18:25.522]  Well, I don't see much evidence that it's the establishment, the big boys, the Chamber of Commerce types, who are rethinking it, because they like it when we bring in cheap labor so they can raise their stock price, their value can go up.
[00:18:26.623 --> 00:18:29.325]  But I think the American people are catching on.
[00:18:29.885 --> 00:18:34.489]  That most of the people who are coming in are willing to work for lower wages.
[00:18:35.229 --> 00:18:41.294]  And they were asking me to comment on these states that passed the minimum wage law the other day.
[00:18:41.314 --> 00:18:49.580]  But it's not the actual amount of the wage that is attracting them.
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:54.364]  These people who come in and are working are willing to work for much lower than the minimum wage.
[00:18:54.484 --> 00:18:57.286]  And they genuinely also get welfare on the side as a supplement?
[00:18:57.326 --> 00:18:58.247]  Yes, they certainly do.
[00:18:59.813 --> 00:19:00.353]  That's right.
[00:19:01.113 --> 00:19:16.877]  And so I think the American people are waking up, and the big question now is are we going to let Obama get by with his executive amnesty, which is he wants to bring in more cheap labor, and of course he's bringing in all these diseases.
[00:19:17.557 --> 00:19:28.619]  We've got children dying with this new kind of a TB disease that's being brought in by these unaccompanied minors who are coming in and trying to go into our schools.
[00:19:30.201 --> 00:19:34.824]  And our children are being sacrificed, regardless of what color, on the altar of globalism.
[00:19:34.844 --> 00:19:41.967]  That's why they couldn't control the borders or planes with Ebola, because they don't want to ever send the message that having a border might be something you might want to have.
[00:19:42.047 --> 00:19:43.248]  Phyllis Schlafly, stay there.
[00:19:43.568 --> 00:19:45.429]  We're going to come back, and I want to get into 2014.
[00:19:45.469 --> 00:19:49.251]  How big of a wake-up was it?
[00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:51.472]  2016, Obama's executive power grab.
[00:19:51.532 --> 00:19:54.033]  Will the Republican establishment try to block it?
[00:19:54.073 --> 00:19:55.174]  But I want to agree with you.
[00:19:55.614 --> 00:19:57.475]  It's the grassroots that's waking up.
[00:19:58.723 --> 00:20:16.418]  Not even so much the elite, but I am seeing a lot of signs that there are a lot of people in the establishment that do see now that we're coming to the end of the road and that globalism is not really a good idea and so they may want to change sides basically right here at the end so they don't get the blame.
[00:20:16.778 --> 00:20:17.539]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:17.559 --> 00:20:18.019]  Stay with us.

[00:23:15.822 --> 00:23:17.704]  Alex Jones here.
[00:23:17.784 --> 00:23:29.030]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:33.413]  So many other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients, synthetic additives,
[00:23:33.573 --> 00:23:33.873]  I think?
[00:23:56.519 --> 00:23:56.839]  We're good.
[00:24:33.473 --> 00:24:34.854]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:34.894 --> 00:24:37.896]  Phyllis Schlafly is our guest today for the rest of the hour.
[00:24:38.036 --> 00:24:39.677]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:24:39.697 --> 00:24:42.419]  If you just joined us, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[00:24:42.439 --> 00:24:47.443]  So I want to just give her the floor right now to get into her view on 2014 election.
[00:24:47.503 --> 00:24:48.444]  What does it really mean?
[00:24:49.044 --> 00:24:51.646]  What does she see looking forward into 2016?
[00:24:52.287 --> 00:24:54.348]  What are the big issues?
[00:24:54.409 --> 00:24:54.689]  Phyllis?
[00:24:55.489 --> 00:25:06.623]  Well, a big issue in the 2014 election was the Republicans getting control of the Senate so they can stop Obama from putting any other judge on the Supreme Court.
[00:25:08.145 --> 00:25:13.472]  If he put one more justice on the Supreme Court, I think he would rule this country for the next 30 years.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:22.722]  And I believe that the Republicans should make a decision that they are not going to confirm any more judges appointed by Obama.
[00:25:22.762 --> 00:25:30.444]  Because he's already done quite an effective job of packing the federal court system with left-wing judges.
[00:25:30.524 --> 00:25:35.586]  Sure, shouldn't they block the people he wants for the Attorney General?
[00:25:35.866 --> 00:25:36.526]  Absolutely.
[00:25:36.866 --> 00:25:37.486]  Absolutely.
[00:25:39.047 --> 00:25:40.307]  They ought to have some fight in them.
[00:25:41.783 --> 00:25:45.146]  The people spoke, and they should carry out the wish of the people.
[00:25:45.866 --> 00:25:50.930]  Obama said his policies were all on the ballot, and okay, we'll accept that.
[00:25:51.411 --> 00:25:53.252]  They were, and the people rejected them.
[00:25:54.233 --> 00:25:58.396]  That's right, the Democrats and Obama said this was basically a referendum.
[00:25:58.797 --> 00:26:00.798]  It was a major political realignment.
[00:26:00.818 --> 00:26:05.202]  I mean, the Democrats haven't been this weak since 1920.
[00:26:05.242 --> 00:26:08.705]  I mean, this really is a sign that they're in trouble.
[00:26:09.605 --> 00:26:19.092]  It certainly is, and so it's a good omen for two years from now, and I hope that the Republicans can stay on the ball and be a fighter.
[00:26:19.232 --> 00:26:25.176]  Let's not have any of this talk about bipartisanship and trying to make a deal with them.
[00:26:25.496 --> 00:26:30.019]  Use our majority and restore some constitutional rules.
[00:26:30.769 --> 00:26:40.115]  The idea of letting Obama make new laws with executive amnesty and executive action is just unacceptable in a free country.
[00:26:40.496 --> 00:26:53.825]  What's gonna happen if Boehner and McConnell ride herd on the good Republicans, there's a lot of good ones in there, and they don't repeal Obamacare or they let Obama sign a bunch of executive orders?
[00:26:54.505 --> 00:26:55.546]  What's the word you're getting?
[00:26:55.586 --> 00:26:57.107]  Are they planning to slap him down?
[00:26:57.407 --> 00:26:58.888]  Because Obama seems belligerent.
[00:26:59.128 --> 00:27:00.269]  He says he's going forward.
[00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:11.555]  Yes he is, and he seems to think that he's some kind of a king who can do whatever he wants, and they shouldn't let him get by with it.
[00:27:12.556 --> 00:27:28.665]  Of course, Congress has control of the money, and when he said he won't close our borders to people with Ebola, he wants $6 billion so he can set up a plan to stop Ebola in West Africa.
[00:27:29.255 --> 00:27:30.697]  Now, we didn't elect him for that.
[00:27:31.417 --> 00:27:33.760]  And Congress holds the poor strings.
[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:35.602]  They shouldn't give him the money.
[00:27:38.064 --> 00:27:38.545]  Wow.
[00:27:40.567 --> 00:27:42.629]  You know, it doesn't make sense.
[00:27:42.969 --> 00:27:51.879]  And now one of the big issues that the Republicans are playing coy about is this new, giving Obama fast track.
[00:27:52.478 --> 00:28:06.845]  Now that's giving him power that they never gave to Clinton or Bush or any of the previous presidents, which means they can go make a trade agreement in secret without consulting anybody, with bypassing Congress, and just make it.
[00:28:07.105 --> 00:28:13.668]  And it becomes a treaty with all the advantages and constitutional protection of a treaty.
[00:28:13.868 --> 00:28:21.954]  And of course, that's that Pacific Trade Partnership that's got 30 parts, only one part's been leaked, and it gives control of the internet over to the UN, basically.
[00:28:22.594 --> 00:28:31.321]  This is dictatorship by shadowy boards, and yeah, the Republicans are talking about handing that to him when he's just been given a mandate to do nothing.
[00:28:32.096 --> 00:28:33.437]  Well, we shouldn't let him do it.
[00:28:33.497 --> 00:28:42.260]  We should kick up a fuss, and I'm sorry, we've got to... Well, now listen, Alex, you know that the big fight is within the Republican Party.
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:42.560]  Oh, yes.
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:49.323]  It's between the establishment, the people who like to think they're the kingmakers of our land, and the grassroots.
[00:28:50.123 --> 00:29:00.687]  And that's why people need to read my new book, A Choice, Not an Echo, because that tells you about all the shady deals and shenanigans that they pulled in the past to give us this series of losers.
[00:29:01.243 --> 00:29:03.083]  We used to call them Me Too candidates.
[00:29:03.143 --> 00:29:06.724]  Whatever the Democrats said, the Republican candidate would say Me Too.
[00:29:07.244 --> 00:29:11.385]  That's right, and it's an updated and expanded 50th anniversary issue.
[00:29:11.405 --> 00:29:13.405]  It brings it up to date.
[00:29:13.466 --> 00:29:14.866]  Tell us about the book before we got a break.
[00:29:15.726 --> 00:29:25.428]  Well, the original book I published in 1964, and of course I couldn't get any publishers, so I did it myself, and sold 3 million copies out of my garage.
[00:29:26.446 --> 00:29:29.188]  And that is what created the conservative movement.
[00:29:29.609 --> 00:29:35.754]  Because it told people that we had a real conservative in support, Barry Goldwater, and we could do it.
[00:29:36.134 --> 00:29:39.637]  And we did nominate him in the convention, despite everything.
[00:29:40.077 --> 00:29:46.002]  And then, of course, the big boys smashed him in the general election.
[00:29:46.402 --> 00:29:50.065]  But we got our reward a few years later when we elected Ronald Reagan.
[00:29:50.849 --> 00:30:00.975]  And if we hadn't created the conservative movement with The Choice Not to Echo in 1964, we wouldn't have gotten Ronald Reagan as the greatest president of the 20th century in 1980.
[00:30:01.095 --> 00:30:02.456]  Fellas, stay there.
[00:30:03.256 --> 00:30:04.597]  This is so important, folks.
[00:30:04.637 --> 00:30:07.359]  What one lady did with a book, changing history.
[00:30:07.419 --> 00:30:08.619]  You could change history, too.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:09.620]  Stay with us.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:10.521]  We're on the march.
[00:30:11.021 --> 00:30:12.622]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:13.562 --> 00:30:16.224]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:20.447 --> 00:30:22.108]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[00:30:22.408 --> 00:30:26.189]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:31.291]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[00:30:31.411 --> 00:30:38.194]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[00:30:38.714 --> 00:30:47.778]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:30:47.998 --> 00:30:53.441]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[00:30:53.561 --> 00:31:00.804]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.
[00:31:01.144 --> 00:31:03.425]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:31:03.706 --> 00:31:08.828]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the InfoWarp.
[00:31:09.188 --> 00:31:13.870]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:15.151]  DNA Force from InfoWarsLife.
[00:31:20.279 --> 00:31:24.141]  On the eve of Thanksgiving this year, I was thinking, what am I really thankful for?
[00:31:24.341 --> 00:31:32.466]  And I gotta tell you, it's my family, it's all the blessings of liberty that our forebearers secured, and it's you, the listeners of the broadcast, who've made everything we do possible.
[00:31:32.626 --> 00:31:40.550]  This Black Friday, I decided to bring you the biggest special we've ever offered on any of the Nutraceuticals at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:44.793]  I'm talking about Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver that we've been sold out of for months.
[00:31:45.033 --> 00:31:46.935]  This time I doubled down and got even more.
[00:31:47.195 --> 00:31:50.677]  As of me taping this on the eve of Thanksgiving, we have already sold half of it.
[00:31:50.778 --> 00:31:57.943]  So instead of keeping the price at its regular discounted price, we are going to give you 20% off and free shipping on single bottles.
[00:31:58.123 --> 00:32:01.526]  But if you get four bottles, we're gonna give you the fifth one free and the free shipping.
[00:32:01.646 --> 00:32:06.249]  I don't know how long this special will run, but if supplies last, we will extend it out until Cyber Monday.
[00:32:06.349 --> 00:32:10.433]  You'll find powerful nutraceuticals like Silver Bullet and others at Infowarslife.com
[00:32:11.013 --> 00:32:11.914]  Another major health threat.
[00:32:11.934 --> 00:32:14.617]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:32:14.637 --> 00:32:16.820]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:32:29.073 --> 00:32:35.855]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:32:36.115 --> 00:32:38.996]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:32:39.136 --> 00:32:42.037]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:32:42.117 --> 00:32:44.058]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:32:44.078 --> 00:32:46.959]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:32:47.039 --> 00:32:52.521]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:32:52.741 --> 00:32:56.223]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:32:56.243 --> 00:32:59.244]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:32:59.344 --> 00:33:06.447]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[00:33:06.647 --> 00:33:09.708]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.
[00:33:09.868 --> 00:33:16.151]  Go to infowarsstore.com today to purchase your ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System.
[00:33:16.291 --> 00:33:16.971]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:33:16.991 --> 00:33:38.179]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:48.487 --> 00:33:56.609]  It was Mary Goldwater who almost became president, but they ran TV ads saying there'd be nuclear war, we'd all die if he got elected.
[00:33:56.629 --> 00:34:09.533]  The Trilateralist Commission is international and is intended to be the vehicle for the multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political government of the United States.
[00:34:10.529 --> 00:34:20.881]  The Trilateralist Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power, political, monetary, intellectual, and ecclesiastical.
[00:34:21.202 --> 00:34:22.443]  They've got most of the churches.
[00:34:22.824 --> 00:34:24.366]  They've got things by the Federal Reserve.
[00:34:24.686 --> 00:34:26.869]  They've got the Democratic Party and most of the Republicans.
[00:34:27.129 --> 00:34:28.591]  They've taken control of the universities.
[00:34:30.319 --> 00:34:31.921]  That's from his book, from a U.S.
[00:34:31.941 --> 00:34:35.284]  Senator from Arizona, Barry Goldwater, with no apologies.
[00:34:36.185 --> 00:34:39.528]  And I know folks that knew Barry Goldwater, just as, of course, Phyllis Schlafly knew him well.
[00:34:39.548 --> 00:34:40.469]  What a great guy.
[00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:42.872]  How wonderful it would have been to have him as president.
[00:34:43.372 --> 00:34:48.477]  Reagan had great rhetoric about how, you know, you did build your business, and freedom's great, and everything else.
[00:34:49.538 --> 00:34:52.639]  Politics got away from him in the Congress and some bad things happened.
[00:34:53.619 --> 00:34:57.000]  Some things I disagree with under Reagan and Ron Paul criticized those as well.
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:03.943]  But compare Ronald Reagan to Obama who says you didn't build your business and Hillary came out and said businesses don't hire people.
[00:35:04.543 --> 00:35:06.103]  There's a war against reality.
[00:35:06.123 --> 00:35:11.685]  We're going to talk to her and walk through this new edition of her book because it's very exciting and I want to hear some of these stories.
[00:35:12.881 --> 00:35:18.944]  Then we're going to open the phones up for your quick question or comment, whether you agree, disagree, whatever, for Phyllis Schlafly.
[00:35:19.324 --> 00:35:23.086]  The toll-free number to join us on this live Monday edition is 800-259-9231.
[00:35:23.106 --> 00:35:23.146]  800-259-9231.
[00:35:23.166 --> 00:35:25.407]  Questions or comments for Phyllis Schlafly.
[00:35:25.427 --> 00:35:26.808]  Again, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:35:26.848 --> 00:35:28.248]  Before we go any further,
[00:35:39.363 --> 00:35:42.666]  We've got a whole bunch of new shirts made in America.
[00:35:43.046 --> 00:35:49.631]  The fabric, they're printed in America, everything, the cotton's grown in America, have come in at Madein1776.com.
[00:35:49.911 --> 00:35:56.136]  Now, I'm wearing right now one of the first that came out last year when we launched the Made in 1776 line.
[00:35:57.137 --> 00:36:00.660]  But this is the Join or Die shirt, one of my favorites.
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:05.584]  But we've got some of the new ones in, the Camo, Molon, Labe, and others.
[00:36:06.324 --> 00:36:11.849]  And we've got the .50 caliber 1776 bottle breachers that just won Shark Tank last week.
[00:36:12.129 --> 00:36:16.213]  We're going to get one of those Navy SEALs that owns the company on in the next few days.
[00:36:16.833 --> 00:36:19.175]  The point is, we know stuff that's interesting.
[00:36:19.536 --> 00:36:25.521]  We've got some new belt buckles coming in that are Molon Labe that will sell out quickly that are made in America.
[00:36:25.861 --> 00:36:26.642]  And all of this
[00:36:28.191 --> 00:36:29.912]  Funds the Infowars operation.
[00:36:29.932 --> 00:36:31.333]  We're not like MSNBC.
[00:36:32.113 --> 00:36:36.135]  They got stimulus money or NPR that gets 400 million of taxpayer money every year.
[00:36:36.995 --> 00:36:41.317]  We are funded by folks buying the great products at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:36:42.751 --> 00:36:48.477]  Or madein1776.com or the great supplements at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:36:49.018 --> 00:36:54.083]  Now, InfoWarsStore.com takes you to a directory of all those sites and shopping carts.
[00:36:54.544 --> 00:36:56.346]  It's basically like a whole shopping center right there.
[00:36:56.986 --> 00:37:00.310]  But when you buy the products from us, it funds the operation.
[00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:02.032]  You're shopping with the good guys.
[00:37:03.624 --> 00:37:17.930]  On top of it, the proprietary supplements like DNA Force, Survival Shield, X2, Oxy Powder, all of it is proprietary to the site and to our developer, Dr. Group, and you've heard the incredible reviews out there.
[00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:31.896]  So, InfoWarsLife.com, and here's the good news, the products are very popular, here's the bad news, we are about to sell out of Survival Shield, we are about to sell out of Lung Cleanse, we are about to sell out of DNA Force, Oxy Powder, Super Mel Vitality, basically everything.
[00:37:32.623 --> 00:37:40.985]  Right as more colloidal silver is set to come in next week, and right as one of our new products is set to come in next week, we actually have some of it in but not enough to even offer it.
[00:37:41.906 --> 00:37:45.587]  So if you want any of these products, InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:37:45.947 --> 00:37:49.908]  Also recommend the Great Longevity line of products discounted at InfoWars.
[00:37:50.288 --> 00:38:00.115]  Health.com, the Beyond Tangy Tangerine, the Pollen Burst, just the Alex Pack, all of it at InfoWarsHealth.com.
[00:38:00.175 --> 00:38:08.681]  You can find links there at InfoWarsStore.com as well, or 888-253-3139.
[00:38:09.021 --> 00:38:12.924]  You can call, ask about any specials, and our great crew will answer your questions.
[00:38:12.944 --> 00:38:15.286]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:38:15.726 --> 00:38:19.488]  Going back to Phyllis Schlafly, of course, of the Eagle Forum.
[00:38:19.508 --> 00:38:21.409]  Phyllis, talk about some of the history.
[00:38:21.469 --> 00:38:22.669]  Talk about Barry Goldwater.
[00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:27.112]  Talk about the new edition of your book and why it's so important for people to get it.
[00:38:28.572 --> 00:38:34.155]  Well, when I brought out A Choice Not An Echo, it had this enormous sale.
[00:38:34.685 --> 00:38:43.332]  And what it did was to inspire people to believe that the grassroots could win against the establishment and nominate a real conservative.
[00:38:43.732 --> 00:38:51.418]  Now let me remind you that in that time period, presidents were supposed to come from New York, Pennsylvania, or Ohio.
[00:38:52.019 --> 00:38:54.241]  And Barry Goldwater was from Arizona.
[00:38:54.821 --> 00:38:58.124]  I didn't know anybody who had ever been to Arizona.
[00:38:58.744 --> 00:39:02.586]  There was no baseball team that was farther west or south than St.
[00:39:02.646 --> 00:39:02.987]  Louis.
[00:39:03.567 --> 00:39:05.288]  It was so far away and so distant.
[00:39:05.308 --> 00:39:07.910]  And yet we picked him, and we made speeches for him.
[00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:09.871]  I made speeches all over the country for him.
[00:39:10.531 --> 00:39:13.293]  And it did get him nominated.
[00:39:13.313 --> 00:39:15.434]  Of course, they clobbered him in the election.
[00:39:15.794 --> 00:39:19.396]  But we stayed together as a grassroots conservative.
[00:39:20.097 --> 00:39:25.500]  And then came Ronald Reagan, and we got him elected, and he had two wonderful presidencies.
[00:39:26.228 --> 00:39:29.555]  Not perfect, but certainly better than anything that Democrats had to offer.
[00:39:30.357 --> 00:39:35.929]  And then they kind of disintegrated after that, and we had people who pretended to be conservatives, they really weren't.
[00:39:36.884 --> 00:39:39.166]  And we've got to revive them.
[00:39:39.606 --> 00:39:45.011]  And that's why I've come out with my 50th anniversary edition of A Choice Not An Echo.
[00:39:45.251 --> 00:39:47.233]  Now, it's not a rewrite of the original.
[00:39:47.293 --> 00:39:50.255]  The original's in there just as I wrote it in 64.
[00:39:50.736 --> 00:40:02.186]  But what I do is to bring it up to date with the shenanigans and the behind-the-closed-door deals that were made in all the Republican National Conventions after 1964.
[00:40:02.226 --> 00:40:04.868]  Brings it right up to date.
[00:40:05.548 --> 00:40:13.311]  And I'm telling listeners, you can't be a player in the presidential election next year unless you know the history, unless you know what's in the past.
[00:40:13.891 --> 00:40:18.053]  Because we want to pick somebody who's picked by the grassroots.
[00:40:18.453 --> 00:40:28.416]  We don't want somebody who wants to bring in all this cheap labor and export our good jobs abroad to cheap labor countries.
[00:40:30.756 --> 00:40:35.639]  So it's a big challenge, but you need to know the history in order to get going in the battle.
[00:40:35.959 --> 00:40:36.279]  I agree.
[00:40:36.319 --> 00:40:39.781]  Phyllis, the founder of the Eagle Forum, Phyllis Schlafly, is our guest.
[00:40:40.481 --> 00:40:42.703]  I want to bring up some inside baseball stories here.
[00:40:42.723 --> 00:40:54.449]  I've been told by high-level folks that at the nomination process for the 1980 election, and I've seen the speeches and seen video clips where Ronald Reagan
[00:40:55.578 --> 00:40:55.678]  We're
[00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:18.102]  And then you have the Clinton dynasty and the Bushes working together.
[00:41:18.162 --> 00:41:22.805]  I was always told at the time that Bush had basically fallen down on the election so Clinton could get in.
[00:41:23.145 --> 00:41:24.546]  Now they call him another son.
[00:41:24.566 --> 00:41:26.267]  That's basically been admitted.
[00:41:26.287 --> 00:41:28.149]  Now we're back to more Clinton and Bush.
[00:41:29.571 --> 00:41:44.416]  Well, let me say, Alex, the story of what they tried to do to Reagan when they realized he was going to be nominated is told in my new book, A Choice, Not an Echo, and it's quite a behind-the-scenes story.
[00:41:44.876 --> 00:41:50.118]  What they tried to do was to make Gerald Ford co-president.
[00:41:50.698 --> 00:41:55.699]  And when Dan Rather accosted me on the floor of the convention, he said, what do you think about this, Mr. Schlafly?
[00:41:56.079 --> 00:41:58.240]  And I said, well, it's completely unconstitutional.
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:11.383]  You want to give the Vice President control of the budget, the money, our sovereignty issues, our tax issues, and leave President Reagan with nothing but the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
[00:42:11.403 --> 00:42:12.443]  Well, let's stop right there.
[00:42:12.763 --> 00:42:13.943]  This is such a big deal.
[00:42:13.983 --> 00:42:16.504]  You're confirming what I was told when I was, you know,
[00:42:17.424 --> 00:42:22.514]  A kid, and when I've talked to high-level Republicans that were there, you were there on record on national television.
[00:42:22.534 --> 00:42:23.456]  You were behind the scenes.
[00:42:24.238 --> 00:42:26.422]  The establishment was so afraid of Reagan.
[00:42:27.133 --> 00:42:36.877]  That they were trying to get him to agree to be a titular head and try to change the Constitution illegally inside the party.
[00:42:37.257 --> 00:42:38.598]  Break down exactly what happened.
[00:42:38.638 --> 00:42:39.398]  It's sensational.
[00:42:39.698 --> 00:42:43.360]  Well, tell a story of my new addition of a choice down in Echo.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:47.762]  But they wanted to give all the real power to the Vice President, who would be Gerald Ford.
[00:42:48.282 --> 00:42:53.384]  And the reason they wanted Gerald Ford was that he was the man who took his orders from Henry Kissinger.
[00:42:54.344 --> 00:43:01.650]  And they thought that that would enable them to run the country even if Reagan were elected president.
[00:43:02.351 --> 00:43:12.479]  And that is why Reagan was pounded so heavily by them that he called George Bush at 11.25 that night.
[00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:17.343]  And I was there in the convention hall at 11.25 and said, get on over here.
[00:43:17.504 --> 00:43:19.245]  Bush was already in his pajamas.
[00:43:19.305 --> 00:43:21.487]  He had given up any hope of being on the ticket.
[00:43:22.134 --> 00:43:27.537]  And Reagan brought him over and introduced Bush because he was afraid he couldn't get through the night.
[00:43:27.777 --> 00:43:36.902]  You know, Walter Cronkite from the Skybox had already announced that Gerald Ford was going to be the co-president and have the real power.
[00:43:39.099 --> 00:43:49.165]  So the elites were just struggling to get their people in, and so George Herbert Walker Bush was seen as a better person for him to choose than Gerald Ford.
[00:43:49.526 --> 00:43:49.926]  Oh yeah.
[00:43:50.346 --> 00:43:51.167]  Bush, sure.
[00:43:51.367 --> 00:43:59.532]  But the first George Bush was the choice of the establishment, no question about that, and the grassroots were for Ronald Reagan.
[00:44:01.173 --> 00:44:04.515]  And then we had enough delegates to nominate Reagan
[00:44:05.188 --> 00:44:19.012]  But the establishment, the so-called Kingmakers, cooked up this deal by which they thought they could take the power away from the president and give it to a vice president they could control.
[00:44:20.713 --> 00:44:21.713]  It's amazing though.
[00:44:21.753 --> 00:44:26.955]  So we learned that Ronald Reagan really was anti-New World Order, anti-globalist.
[00:44:28.195 --> 00:44:28.515]  Sure.
[00:44:28.836 --> 00:44:30.036]  But then he gets shot.
[00:44:31.807 --> 00:44:34.309]  And then he goes in for treatment and comes back out.
[00:44:34.789 --> 00:44:36.451]  I know you were in both administrations.
[00:44:36.511 --> 00:44:39.112]  What can you say about what happened inside of those administrations?
[00:44:40.153 --> 00:44:42.235]  Well, Reagan wasn't perfect.
[00:44:42.375 --> 00:44:44.837]  But he certainly was better than anybody else in sight.
[00:44:45.517 --> 00:44:47.498]  And he was the choice of the grassroots.
[00:44:48.259 --> 00:44:54.063]  And he did not turn over all his power to Ford or anybody else.
[00:44:54.884 --> 00:44:57.386]  And yes, he made a number of mistakes.
[00:44:58.633 --> 00:45:03.077]  That's a big difference from Obama, who obviously wants to destroy it.
[00:45:22.005 --> 00:45:25.068]  Well, our ideals were better and we certainly were exceptional.
[00:45:25.668 --> 00:45:32.754]  Now we're an exceptional paradox of just horrible socialists and crony capitalists and then all the other free market folks making this country go.
[00:45:33.095 --> 00:45:41.262]  Why do you think the Democrats are so arrogant now and admit they're lying and admit they want to wreck the economy and saying you didn't build your business?
[00:45:41.762 --> 00:45:43.463]  I mean, that's a way to discredit themselves.
[00:45:43.524 --> 00:45:44.905]  Are they that disconnected?
[00:45:46.246 --> 00:45:49.449]  Well, they have a lot of rich people
[00:45:50.324 --> 00:45:55.133]  And they've always had more money than the grassroots movement.
[00:45:55.614 --> 00:46:00.343]  And I think they were doing a bit of gloating but they
[00:46:02.225 --> 00:46:05.007]  They simply want to continue to control things.
[00:46:05.047 --> 00:46:05.868]  They always have.
[00:46:06.308 --> 00:46:19.477]  And I'm telling the people listening to this program, we beat them in 1964 when we nominated Goldwater, and we beat them in 1980 and 1984 when we nominated Ronald Reagan, and we can do it again if you'll get with it.
[00:46:19.957 --> 00:46:27.682]  Read my books so you know the shenanigans they pulled before, and we won't let them get by with giving us another loser for president this time.
[00:46:27.802 --> 00:46:34.527]  Well, I've never seen the establishment this scared, and I've gone back through the history, and I want to see if you concur with that.
[00:46:34.887 --> 00:46:38.249]  They are really scared of the Tea Party insurrection taking over the Republicans.
[00:46:38.749 --> 00:46:46.234]  They are absolutely lining up against it, but I'm seeing a lot of good signs of major talk show hosts realizing that and now saying that.
[00:46:47.015 --> 00:46:55.040]  And what do you expect them to pull now to try to get a Chris Christie or a Jeb Bush over a Rand Paul or a Ted Cruz?
[00:46:55.601 --> 00:46:56.621]  What do you expect them to pull?
[00:46:57.762 --> 00:47:02.827]  Well, I'm not picking my guy at the present time, but I can tell you it's pretty clear that their number one guy is Jeb Bush.
[00:47:16.296 --> 00:47:21.480]  You know, they believe in the British system of primogeniture.
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:23.161]  They want to take the next one in line.
[00:47:23.721 --> 00:47:26.563]  And if there's the next one in line, there's been one loser after another.
[00:47:26.583 --> 00:47:29.805]  I don't believe the American people are willing to elect another Bush.
[00:47:30.025 --> 00:47:31.626]  Yeah, we rejected royalty in 1776.
[00:47:31.686 --> 00:47:31.866]  We did.
[00:47:33.846 --> 00:47:44.072]  And so, but the grassroots can do it, so get on out, join, and realize that the fight is in the Republican Party.
[00:47:44.152 --> 00:47:45.954]  That's where the important fight is.
[00:47:46.374 --> 00:47:53.678]  Now, we lost several good candidates, including my own candidate for state rep by the Libertarian votes.
[00:47:54.599 --> 00:47:58.021]  It took more than his margin by which he lost.
[00:48:00.474 --> 00:48:05.078]  Maybe you wish we had many parties, like other countries do.
[00:48:05.218 --> 00:48:07.120]  I don't wish that, but some people may.
[00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:10.182]  But we have a two-party system.
[00:48:10.222 --> 00:48:15.126]  Well, I've clearly said... You go to war with the army you have, not the army you wish you had.
[00:48:15.506 --> 00:48:16.287]  Well, I agree.
[00:48:17.047 --> 00:48:24.253]  I vote Libertarian when both candidates are bad, but I said in this election, if there's a Tea Party patriot running against a Democrat,
[00:48:24.973 --> 00:48:29.177]  And even if they're not perfect, you've got to vote for them, because this is a referendum on tyranny.
[00:48:29.417 --> 00:48:30.779]  We have to bring them down.
[00:48:31.059 --> 00:48:32.300]  We have to bloody their nose.
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.862]  We have to make them pay.
[00:48:34.162 --> 00:48:37.265]  We've got to take over... And we did a pretty good job.
[00:48:37.505 --> 00:48:37.705]  Yeah.
[00:48:38.466 --> 00:48:39.567]  We did a pretty good job.
[00:48:39.627 --> 00:48:40.388]  I was really proud of it.
[00:48:40.408 --> 00:48:44.752]  We didn't get everybody, but we got an awful lot and a lot more than they expected to get.
[00:48:46.701 --> 00:48:48.282]  Well, Phyllis, it's just amazing.
[00:48:49.363 --> 00:48:52.725]  I want to have you back on again soon just to talk about the book for a full hour.
[00:48:52.745 --> 00:48:54.826]  I want to go to a few phone calls.
[00:48:54.846 --> 00:48:57.808]  Because I've got so many good inside stories.
[00:48:58.289 --> 00:49:01.070]  And it's up to date.
[00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:03.512]  And you've got to have the ammo if you're going to go to battle.
[00:49:05.513 --> 00:49:06.034]  Wow.
[00:49:06.114 --> 00:49:10.997]  And the ammo is A Choice, Not an Echo, New 50th Anniversary Edition.
[00:49:11.718 --> 00:49:14.881]  Well, I want to talk to the publisher and maybe carry it at the InfoWars store as well.
[00:49:14.921 --> 00:49:15.802]  I can't wait to read it.
[00:49:15.822 --> 00:49:18.986]  I mean, I read the original book, but I haven't, that was like 15 years ago.
[00:49:19.026 --> 00:49:22.670]  I want to read this updated, expanded version.
[00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:23.791]  Phyllis Schlafly is our guest.
[00:49:23.831 --> 00:49:29.377]  I want to go to a few phone calls here when we come back from break, but maybe we'll skip this network break for time.
[00:49:29.417 --> 00:49:33.762]  But Phyllis, anything else you'd like to add to the viewers and listeners out there?
[00:49:34.167 --> 00:49:43.057]  Well, what's in the book is the inside story, like that 1980 behind-the-scenes story of what they tried to do with Reagan is just simply incredible.
[00:49:43.883 --> 00:49:46.065]  And it shows you how these people operate.
[00:49:46.145 --> 00:49:50.588]  And they've got the power and the clout and they do a lot.
[00:49:50.668 --> 00:49:53.209]  But I think people are waking up to that.
[00:49:53.770 --> 00:50:01.475]  You know, at the present time, what they're trying to do is to give Obama more power than the previous presidents ever had.
[00:50:01.515 --> 00:50:08.500]  They want to give him fast track so he can make any deal with foreign countries and not even let Congress know.
[00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:10.221]  Make a deal and make it into the law.
[00:50:11.024 --> 00:50:12.104]  It's called fast track.
[00:50:12.144 --> 00:50:13.825]  Why would we give him any more power?
[00:50:14.125 --> 00:50:15.466]  It blows my mind.
[00:50:17.147 --> 00:50:17.787]  That's right.
[00:50:18.327 --> 00:50:22.689]  In fact, I've seen some Rand Paul statements where he's like, we need to get trade done.
[00:50:22.709 --> 00:50:26.030]  And he needs to clarify that because that's what the other Republicans are saying.
[00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:27.311]  It means give him the power.
[00:50:28.091 --> 00:50:35.114]  He's been given a mandate to be indicted, to be impeached, not a mandate to expand power.
[00:50:35.174 --> 00:50:37.015]  The mandate is repeal Obamacare.
[00:50:37.435 --> 00:50:39.036]  Phyllis Schlafly, what's going to happen
[00:50:39.796 --> 00:50:55.014]  If the neocons and rhinos are able to suppress the Liberty Movement and the Republican Party, and if they don't repeal Obamacare, if they don't shut the President down, if they let him shut down more power plants, if they let him have executive amnesty, I mean, if they do that, what's going to happen?
[00:50:55.875 --> 00:50:58.378]  Well, I'm making up my mind that's not going to happen.
[00:51:00.269 --> 00:51:06.736]  And we've got to educate the grassroots and tell them that they have the power if they will only use it.
[00:51:07.077 --> 00:51:08.478]  That's what we're up against today.
[00:51:08.498 --> 00:51:13.504]  Because a lot of people, you realize there's not many people who can remember 1964 now.
[00:51:14.405 --> 00:51:20.712]  And we need to tell them that we are a country of we the people.
[00:51:21.172 --> 00:51:22.913]  Well, I'll say this about Barry Goldwater.
[00:51:23.533 --> 00:51:30.057]  I mean, nobody was talking about New World Order and trilateral commissions and, you know, just all this stuff back when he was.
[00:51:30.418 --> 00:51:34.580]  He was doing it when it was like speaking Martian because he really cared and was warning people.
[00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:36.581]  He was being the opposite of a politician.
[00:51:36.982 --> 00:51:38.803]  He was being a statesman and studying the two.
[00:51:39.583 --> 00:51:45.827]  Though Reagan was probably more well-spoken and maybe better looking, Barry Goldwater would have been an incredible president.
[00:51:47.028 --> 00:51:48.989]  Yes, he was an authentic conservative.
[00:51:49.938 --> 00:51:51.239]  And that's what we want.
[00:51:51.679 --> 00:51:56.701]  Somebody who really cares about this country and believes our country should be the best and the biggest.
[00:51:57.261 --> 00:52:08.607]  One of the things that I have been responsible for repeatedly putting in the Republican policy platform, adopted at the Republican Convention, is that we need military superiority.
[00:52:09.127 --> 00:52:11.008]  It's not enough to be just strong.
[00:52:11.528 --> 00:52:13.449]  We've got to be the biggest and the best.
[00:52:13.949 --> 00:52:17.911]  And that's the best key to peace for ourselves and for everybody else.
[00:52:18.695 --> 00:52:23.158]  Well, it would be if we didn't have neocons and Obama launching all these wars.
[00:52:23.558 --> 00:52:25.420]  That's why people want to cut the military.
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:31.784]  My concern is they're trying to twist the military into a domestic force with all those memos to go after the Tea Party.
[00:52:32.064 --> 00:52:33.005]  Do you find that chilling?
[00:52:33.706 --> 00:52:37.068]  Yes, and I also find it chilly that they're putting women in combat.
[00:52:37.489 --> 00:52:41.011]  I don't have any respect for the military who send women into combat.
[00:52:41.372 --> 00:52:50.038]  It's kind of like if you hear a noise in your house in the middle of the night and the husband turns over and says, honey, you go on downstairs and see what's going on.
[00:52:50.058 --> 00:52:52.399]  Well, it's a war on reality.
[00:52:52.459 --> 00:52:56.262]  I mean, men can't make babies and men are ugly and women look good.
[00:52:56.322 --> 00:52:58.124]  I mean, there are differences.
[00:52:58.144 --> 00:53:00.085]  The job of the men is to protect their family.
[00:53:00.948 --> 00:53:01.409]  Exactly.
[00:53:01.449 --> 00:53:02.310]  It's men's jobs.
[00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:06.354]  I mean, men, at least the men I know, want to protect their family.
[00:53:06.634 --> 00:53:07.235]  Sure they do.
[00:53:07.656 --> 00:53:16.525]  That's why recent figures show that men who have children earn more money than men who don't.
[00:53:17.046 --> 00:53:18.748]  Well, that's just because they work harder.
[00:53:18.848 --> 00:53:19.689]  They've got a motive.
[00:53:21.357 --> 00:53:25.980]  Well, the minute my wife had our first child, my son, all the, it just clicked.
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:32.704]  Everything in me, I suddenly wanted to be more successful, wanted to work harder, grew up a lot, and it's biological.
[00:53:32.724 --> 00:53:33.565]  Yeah.
[00:53:34.568 --> 00:53:36.628]  And we need to encourage that.
[00:53:36.668 --> 00:53:44.710]  Of course, you're fighting the feminists, but you need to read my other book, Who Killed the American Family?, and you'll see the damage that the feminists did.
[00:53:44.830 --> 00:53:45.850]  I have read that book.
[00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:49.071]  I want to have you back on in a few weeks, so you'll do it just on that book as well.
[00:53:49.511 --> 00:53:50.691]  Phyllis Schlafly is our guest.
[00:53:50.791 --> 00:53:52.112]  Randy in Texas.
[00:53:52.212 --> 00:53:54.072]  Randy, you're on the air.
[00:53:54.132 --> 00:53:54.572]  Go ahead.
[00:53:55.693 --> 00:53:56.573]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:53:56.633 --> 00:53:58.793]  Phyllis, you are God sent.
[00:54:00.614 --> 00:54:02.434]  I went to a program the other evening
[00:54:03.191 --> 00:54:05.312]  Where John Danforth was the speaker.
[00:54:05.332 --> 00:54:15.315]  I know you know John probably very well, and I'd like you to speak about him a little bit, but let me just tell you one thing that he said that was very disturbing to me.
[00:54:15.855 --> 00:54:25.618]  He told me, point blank, that his wife campaigned and raised funds for Mark Pryor in Arkansas.
[00:54:27.099 --> 00:54:31.080]  If that is going on Republican to Democrat,
[00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:42.136]  Something is grossly wrong in this country, and I'd like you to address what you believe that Mr. Danforth's position really is on the Republican Party and conservatism in general.
[00:54:43.117 --> 00:54:49.641]  Well, it's not surprising, because we in Missouri, I live in Missouri, consider him part of the establishment crowd.
[00:54:50.422 --> 00:54:58.207]  And this fight we've been talking about in the National Republican Party between the establishment and the grassroots goes on in the different states.
[00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:03.163]  And in Missouri, Danforth is definitely in the establishment crowd.
[00:55:03.563 --> 00:55:10.988]  Now I'm happy to tell you that in the last election for Missouri's state chairman, we elected a grassrooter.
[00:55:11.208 --> 00:55:12.989]  We elected a real conservative.
[00:55:13.409 --> 00:55:15.070]  And you know, it's kind of funny.
[00:55:15.631 --> 00:55:20.974]  Missouri has a pretty slick system for electing the state chairman.
[00:55:21.294 --> 00:55:23.356]  It's kind of like the way they elect the Pope.
[00:55:23.896 --> 00:55:26.998]  They had a secret ballot, and somebody counts the ballots.
[00:55:27.678 --> 00:55:33.465]  And, uh, Ed Martin won by about three or four votes, and then they immediately take the ballots out and burn them.
[00:55:33.785 --> 00:55:38.631]  That's the way the Pope—they do for the Pope, you know, and the smoke goes up, and then the people know there's been a new Pope.
[00:55:39.514 --> 00:55:51.180]  Well, anyway, we got a conservative, a non-establishment guy, and you can do that in your state and get your grassroots elected as delegates to the Republican National Convention.
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:51.841]  Very exciting.
[00:55:51.861 --> 00:55:52.741]  We're almost out of time.
[00:55:52.781 --> 00:55:53.742]  Thank you so much, Randy.
[00:55:53.762 --> 00:55:55.523]  I'll see if Phil can do five more into overdrive.
[00:55:55.843 --> 00:55:57.884]  Paul Watson's coming on overdrive into the next hour.
[00:55:57.924 --> 00:55:59.945]  I've got Paul Watson coming on with huge breaking news.
[00:56:00.405 --> 00:56:02.326]  I'm trying to get as many of these calls as possible.
[00:56:03.267 --> 00:56:05.108]  I think the Democrats have jumped the shark.
[00:56:05.868 --> 00:56:09.351]  In that they just openly say, we're criminals, we're liars, ah-ha-ha.
[00:56:09.831 --> 00:56:11.612]  I believe they've gone insane like Nero.
[00:56:12.333 --> 00:56:15.275]  And we've got a real chance to beat them now, folks.
[00:56:15.295 --> 00:56:18.797]  They've had so much power that they've acted like lunatics.
[00:56:19.298 --> 00:56:21.719]  And the Republicans that have worked with them are going to be exposed.
[00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:25.542]  If we take this initiative, I believe we can take the country back.
[00:56:25.742 --> 00:56:26.643]  Phyllis, what do you say to that?
[00:56:26.983 --> 00:56:28.344]  Yes, I do.
[00:56:28.604 --> 00:56:29.765]  I absolutely do believe.
[00:56:30.145 --> 00:56:31.426]  And not only that, we must.
[00:56:32.427 --> 00:56:33.608]  Our future depends on it.
[00:56:35.283 --> 00:56:37.284]  Go to my website, EagleFarm.org.
[00:56:37.925 --> 00:56:39.406]  Let's go to Patrick in Texas.
[00:56:39.446 --> 00:56:40.186]  Patrick, you're on the air.
[00:56:40.226 --> 00:56:40.546]  Go ahead.
[00:56:41.787 --> 00:56:42.588]  Hey, Alex.
[00:56:42.768 --> 00:56:44.869]  It's a pleasure listening to you.
[00:56:44.889 --> 00:56:45.689]  Hi, Phyllis.
[00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:47.070]  Hi.
[00:56:47.971 --> 00:56:53.234]  I was a fan of Reagan when I found out that he tried to get rid of the Federal Reserve.
[00:56:53.254 --> 00:56:55.976]  And I think that's why they tried to murder him, you know?
[00:56:56.296 --> 00:56:57.036]  And the IRS.
[00:56:57.276 --> 00:56:57.477]  Yep.
[00:56:58.017 --> 00:56:58.937]  Yeah, and the IRS.
[00:56:59.358 --> 00:57:03.100]  And also, as far as, you know, businesses creating jobs.
[00:57:03.587 --> 00:57:14.723]  The one thing that I think about is the public, you know, their demand for a product, and then the banks allowing the public to get money in order to make these products and actually start entrepreneurship.
[00:57:14.963 --> 00:57:18.248]  And that doesn't happen, and you know, that's the biggest enemy we have are the banks.
[00:57:19.347 --> 00:57:23.030]  Well, the central banks that are waging war on the regular banks, I agree with you.
[00:57:23.050 --> 00:57:26.033]  Phyllis, who is the biggest enemy in corporate America?
[00:57:26.053 --> 00:57:29.256]  You mentioned Chamber of Commerce, all these groups.
[00:57:29.557 --> 00:57:32.519]  The unions vote for open borders, they vote for NAFTA and GATT.
[00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:35.883]  I mean, it's just all these special interests are controlled by who?
[00:57:37.310 --> 00:57:49.217]  Well, I don't know that they're all controlled by anybody, but we certainly, all these groups are pushing for open borders, and we shouldn't let them get by with it, because the majority of people don't want that.
[00:57:49.873 --> 00:57:52.854]  And what they just want is cheap labor.
[00:57:52.934 --> 00:57:53.774]  That's what it's for.
[00:57:54.395 --> 00:58:00.757]  And we should reform the laws that are encouraging businesses to send their good jobs overseas.
[00:58:00.917 --> 00:58:01.797]  It's just awful.
[00:58:02.197 --> 00:58:03.818]  Free trade is such a deceit.
[00:58:03.838 --> 00:58:06.559]  Yeah, because they ride it one-sided.
[00:58:06.639 --> 00:58:10.240]  I've got a little five-minute segment here coming up in about a minute at the break.
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:11.180]  Can you do it?
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:12.461]  If you can't, I've got one more question.
[00:58:12.501 --> 00:58:12.681]  No.
[00:58:13.141 --> 00:58:14.761]  No, I have to go.
[00:58:14.781 --> 00:58:15.282]  I have another.
[00:58:15.302 --> 00:58:15.922]  I understand.
[00:58:15.942 --> 00:58:17.122]  I know you're a hard worker.
[00:58:17.142 --> 00:58:17.943]  Well, then here's my question.
[00:58:17.963 --> 00:58:19.083]  We'll have to take calls on their time.
[00:58:20.126 --> 00:58:28.705]  Can't feminists now see that what they were sold as feminism doesn't empower women and has actually really screwed up women's position and everybody's position?
[00:58:28.725 --> 00:58:30.369]  I mean, isn't feminism in trouble?
[00:58:31.061 --> 00:58:35.203]  Feminism is in big trouble, but we can discuss that the next time I come on your show.
[00:58:35.743 --> 00:58:39.465]  All right, well thank you so much for joining us, Phyllis Schlafly.
[00:58:39.905 --> 00:58:41.066]  Okay, bye Alex.
[00:58:41.266 --> 00:58:42.727]  All right, very interesting lady folks.
[00:58:42.787 --> 00:58:52.392]  I'm telling you, she really is at the heart of what you see with the Tea Party, Liberty Movement, you name it today, battling the Republican Rockefeller Bluebloods.
[00:58:53.432 --> 00:58:55.953]  And I mean, they would have totally taken over if it wasn't for folks like her.
[00:58:56.514 --> 00:58:57.794]  All right, I'm going to go to a few of your calls.
[00:58:57.814 --> 00:58:59.235]  Didn't miss talking to her when we come back.
[00:59:00.834 --> 00:59:02.598]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:59:04.022 --> 00:59:06.267]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:10.211 --> 00:59:14.134]  On the eve of Thanksgiving this year, I was thinking, what am I really thankful for?
[00:59:14.294 --> 00:59:22.379]  And I gotta tell you, it's my family, it's all the blessings of liberty that our forebearers secured, and it's you, the listeners of the broadcast, who've made everything we do possible.
[00:59:22.579 --> 00:59:30.485]  This Black Friday, I decided to bring you the biggest special we've ever offered on any of the Nutraceuticals at Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:30.945 --> 00:59:34.726]  I'm talking about silver bullet colloidal silver that we've been sold out of for months.
[00:59:34.966 --> 00:59:36.867]  This time I doubled down and got even more.
[00:59:37.147 --> 00:59:40.608]  As of me taping this on the eve of Thanksgiving, we have already sold half of it.
[00:59:40.708 --> 00:59:47.870]  So instead of keeping the price at its regular discounted price, we are going to give you 20% off and free shipping on single bottles.
[00:59:48.050 --> 00:59:51.451]  But if you get four bottles, we're gonna give you the fifth one free and the free shipping.
[00:59:51.571 --> 00:59:53.051]  I don't know how long this special will run, but if
[00:59:53.191 --> 00:59:54.812]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:25.086 --> 01:00:25.706]  Big Brother.
[01:00:26.387 --> 01:00:27.407]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:28.148 --> 01:00:29.248]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:29.909 --> 01:00:30.709]  You want answers?
[01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:32.390]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:36.652]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:37.233 --> 01:00:40.674]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:48.342 --> 01:00:48.963]  Touchdown!
[01:00:49.023 --> 01:00:53.706]  Jubilation as the Rosetta mission is a success.
[01:00:54.447 --> 01:00:59.391]  Landing on a comet traveling 34,000 miles per hour towards the sun.
[01:00:59.972 --> 01:01:01.653]  That's the stuff dreams are made of.
[01:01:02.834 --> 01:01:04.836]  Well, we got Freeway Ricky Ross.
[01:01:06.172 --> 01:01:08.073]  The biggest coke dealer probably in U.S.
[01:01:08.093 --> 01:01:14.537]  history ever, quote, busted joining us to blow the history of CIA drug trafficking wide open.
[01:01:14.557 --> 01:01:16.699]  Of course, the big movie, Kill the Messenger.
[01:01:16.719 --> 01:01:19.901]  Guys, give me the IMDb printout on that, please.
[01:01:21.461 --> 01:01:26.625]  Also portrays Ross Innott, and he's here with us in Austin, Texas.
[01:01:27.711 --> 01:01:31.053]  Before he goes to speak to some college students up in Dallas.
[01:01:31.974 --> 01:01:34.576]  And we're going to be, I've been talking to him since he was in prison.
[01:01:34.636 --> 01:01:35.937]  He's been in prison 25 years.
[01:01:36.738 --> 01:01:38.239]  But he's going to be in studio with us.
[01:01:38.259 --> 01:01:39.019]  I haven't even met him yet.
[01:01:39.059 --> 01:01:39.880]  He came in last night.
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:41.141]  He's been out with the crew.
[01:01:41.821 --> 01:01:47.806]  He just arrived and so he'll be in studio with us coming up in the next segment.
[01:01:48.827 --> 01:01:49.607]  Well breaking!
[01:01:49.627 --> 01:01:50.088]  The U.S.
[01:01:50.148 --> 01:01:53.630]  and China just announced a huge deal on climate.
[01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:55.772]  You mean a huge tax deal like Obamacare?
[01:01:57.625 --> 01:02:00.986]  Or the plan to take over the Internet and tax it and regulate it, to protect it.
[01:02:01.406 --> 01:02:02.446]  Obamacare for the Internet.
[01:02:02.986 --> 01:02:03.666]  A huge decision.
[01:02:03.686 --> 01:02:06.927]  He's getting ready on the Internet, on carbon taxes, on your guns.
[01:02:07.307 --> 01:02:11.728]  With the UN Treaty, he says he'll honor that goes in December 24th, a little Christmas present.
[01:02:13.628 --> 01:02:14.469]  Wide open borders.
[01:02:14.829 --> 01:02:15.809]  Going after your guns.
[01:02:16.109 --> 01:02:17.449]  Going after your energy prices.
[01:02:17.729 --> 01:02:19.150]  Going after you with carbon taxes.
[01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:21.470]  Going after you, going after you, going after you.
[01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:23.611]  Going after Fast Track to sign over sovereignty.
[01:02:23.831 --> 01:02:25.451]  Republican leadership involved in that.
[01:02:26.564 --> 01:02:27.044]  The U.S.
[01:02:27.064 --> 01:02:30.005]  and China just announced a huge deal on climate!
[01:02:30.105 --> 01:02:31.105]  Yeah!
[01:02:32.585 --> 01:02:35.006]  And it's a game-changer, Mother Jones reports.
[01:02:35.266 --> 01:02:35.966]  Oh, yes!
[01:02:36.606 --> 01:02:46.549]  The surprise agreement, you mean the sneak attack, aims to double the price of carbon pollution reduction in the United States only!
[01:02:47.089 --> 01:02:47.929]  What a great deal!
[01:02:48.689 --> 01:02:54.631]  You make it harder to work and have factories here, and force it over to China that always signs on but doesn't comply.
[01:02:55.831 --> 01:02:57.071]  Dirty coal power plants.
[01:02:57.111 --> 01:02:58.052]  Three being built a week.
[01:02:58.352 --> 01:02:59.872]  We have more than three being shut down a week.
[01:02:59.912 --> 01:03:00.353]  Clean ones.
[01:03:01.413 --> 01:03:03.794]  What a day, you Obama!
[01:03:04.574 --> 01:03:07.675]  Wow, our electricity already costs five times what it does in China.
[01:03:10.336 --> 01:03:11.796]  So no wonder no one wants to build.
[01:03:12.096 --> 01:03:13.317]  Thank you, yeah!
[01:03:13.557 --> 01:03:14.937]  Let's make it ten times!
[01:03:15.498 --> 01:03:17.778]  Oh man, Obama, what a great deal!
[01:03:18.119 --> 01:03:22.120]  Make our energy ten times more expensive than Chinese coal power energy.
[01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:28.004]  And the average American goes, I don't own coal stocks, I don't have a coal stove.
[01:03:28.605 --> 01:03:34.632]  All you electric car people with your volts and all of you that are like, look at that gasoline guzzling truck.
[01:03:35.192 --> 01:03:37.055]  And you got your electric lawnmowers.
[01:03:37.495 --> 01:03:38.656]  It comes from coal.
[01:03:38.676 --> 01:03:40.338]  Coal, coal, coal.
[01:03:40.499 --> 01:03:42.461]  Coal, coal, coal.
[01:03:45.256 --> 01:03:48.900]  I mean, this is like a bandit blowing the race car engine before the race.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:55.547]  Obama's driving the Chinese race car, and he comes over and like throws a hand grenade in the engine, and we go, oh, thank you!
[01:03:56.087 --> 01:03:57.249]  The engine just, boom, blows out.
[01:03:57.269 --> 01:04:01.293]  Oh, that's such a good... And he's like, wait, the engine didn't totally blow?
[01:04:01.493 --> 01:04:03.836]  Throw an Obamacare hand grenade in there.
[01:04:04.937 --> 01:04:06.999]  Bring in 60 million illegals to bankrupt things.
[01:04:07.019 --> 01:04:07.800]  Another hand grenade.
[01:04:09.056 --> 01:04:12.899]  The thing is, the country was so rich and so powerful, they just can't blow the engine.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:15.681]  You filth!
[01:04:16.161 --> 01:04:20.024]  And we've got 60 million people refusing to pay the income tax, keeping the economy going.
[01:04:20.184 --> 01:04:21.125]  It's meant to shut it off.
[01:04:21.966 --> 01:04:25.048]  Oh, you filth, you trash, you scum.
[01:04:25.068 --> 01:04:27.170]  I mean, this country's under total attack.
[01:04:28.027 --> 01:04:41.973]  In a surprise announcement last night, the world's two biggest economies and greenhouse gas emitters, the United States and China, said they will partner closely on a broad-ranging package of plans to fight climate change, including new targets to reduce carbon pollution, according to a statement from the White House.
[01:04:42.974 --> 01:04:46.115]  But it's going to start out with doubling the price in the U.S.
[01:04:46.135 --> 01:04:47.536]  because we're the leader in that.
[01:04:47.776 --> 01:04:49.137]  Look at Obama smiling.
[01:04:49.337 --> 01:04:49.837]  Can you imagine?
[01:04:50.257 --> 01:04:53.699]  Oh, because they don't just cut the power off, they then charge you more for it.
[01:04:58.746 --> 01:05:01.448]  Alright folks, we're going to go to break now.
[01:05:04.049 --> 01:05:09.953]  And when we return, Freeway Ricky Ross, the real Rick Ross, in studio.
[01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:16.817]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, follow us on Twitter, RealAlexJones.
[01:05:16.837 --> 01:05:17.297]  Stay with us.
[01:05:20.228 --> 01:05:24.529]  For months, the Infowars Live Silver Bullet colloidal silver has been completely sold out.
[01:05:24.769 --> 01:05:29.871]  Now, we have finally procured a limited supply from one of the leading manufacturers of nutraceuticals in the nation.
[01:05:29.991 --> 01:05:31.912]  But here's what's truly exciting.
[01:05:32.052 --> 01:05:42.335]  While we could simply sell the survival silver for its already discounted shelf price, we have decided to give back to you, the listeners, and make it all possible with a pre-Black Friday mega sale.
[01:05:42.455 --> 01:05:45.116]  We are launching this mega special with an unprecedented

[01:05:51.079 --> 01:05:58.022]  And to help everyone stock up for the next shortage, when you buy four bottles of Silver Bullet, you'll receive the fifth one absolutely free.
[01:05:58.202 --> 01:06:01.204]  That's on top of the 20% off savings and free shipping.
[01:06:01.284 --> 01:06:05.466]  Finally, if supplies hold, we will extend this special out to Cyber Monday.
[01:06:05.706 --> 01:06:08.349]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've never done anything like this before.

[01:06:53.778 --> 01:06:57.739]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:06:58.059 --> 01:06:59.499]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:06:59.839 --> 01:07:04.860]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:07.421]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[01:07:07.681 --> 01:07:08.521]  But for how long?
[01:07:08.821 --> 01:07:10.821]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com.
[01:07:11.041 --> 01:07:15.082]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L bodyarmor.com.
[01:07:15.462 --> 01:07:16.643]  Infidel Body Armor.
[01:07:17.343 --> 01:07:18.283]  Just won't quit.
[01:07:19.764 --> 01:07:23.626]  On the eve of Thanksgiving this year, I was thinking, what am I really thankful for?
[01:07:23.846 --> 01:07:31.971]  And I gotta tell you, it's my family, it's all the blessings of liberty that our forebearers secured, and it's you, the listeners of the broadcast, who've made everything we do possible.
[01:07:32.131 --> 01:07:40.055]  This Black Friday, I decided to bring you the biggest special we've ever offered on any of the Nutraceuticals at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:40.515 --> 01:07:44.258]  I'm talking about Silver Bullet Loyal Silver that we've been sold out of for months.
[01:07:44.538 --> 01:07:46.439]  This time I doubled down and got even more.
[01:07:46.699 --> 01:07:50.162]  As of me taping this on the eve of Thanksgiving, we have already sold half of it.
[01:07:50.282 --> 01:07:57.447]  So instead of keeping the price at its regular discounted price, we are going to give you 20% off and free shipping on single bottles.
[01:07:57.607 --> 01:08:00.989]  But if you get four bottles, we're gonna give you the fifth one free and the free shipping.
[01:08:01.129 --> 01:08:05.734]  I don't know how long this special will run, but if supplies last, we will extend it out until Cyber Monday.
[01:08:05.834 --> 01:08:11.620]  You'll find powerful nutraceuticals like Silver Bullet and others at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:19.248]  Again, this is Alex Jones wishing you all a blessed and happy Thanksgiving and thanking you all for your support of freedom.
[01:08:22.290 --> 01:08:30.277]  Yet our best-trained, best-educated, best-equipped, best-prepared troops refuse to fight.
[01:08:31.118 --> 01:08:37.824]  Matter of fact, it's safe to say that they would rather switch than fight!
[01:08:38.564 --> 01:08:40.286]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:40.686 --> 01:08:42.148]  Because there is a war on.
[01:08:42.728 --> 01:08:43.469]  Or your mind.
[01:08:59.955 --> 01:09:03.377]  Alright folks, we're broadcasting worldwide now into the second hour.
[01:09:04.358 --> 01:09:07.180]  Coming up the third hour, we're going to open the phones up for listeners.
[01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:11.743]  Your chance to talk to Freeway Ricky Ross.
[01:09:12.751 --> 01:09:19.273]  And of course, Rick Ross has been recognized as a major pawn of the CIA drug war game.
[01:09:19.773 --> 01:09:22.213]  He was a pioneer in the crack cocaine trade in Los Angeles.
[01:09:22.253 --> 01:09:27.955]  Ross harvested millions of dollars a day as an unknown participant of the CIA and U.S.
[01:09:27.975 --> 01:09:29.935]  Drug Enforcement Agency ops.
[01:09:30.516 --> 01:09:34.276]  And then long after he got out of it, they still set him up and sent him to prison.
[01:09:34.376 --> 01:09:36.077]  And here's my issue.
[01:09:39.508 --> 01:09:46.192]  It's the government that made narcotics illegal when prohibition ended of alcohol because they needed another business to skim off of.
[01:09:46.212 --> 01:09:46.872]  That's on record.
[01:09:47.172 --> 01:09:50.674]  They've been shipping the narcotics into this country since they made them illegal.
[01:09:50.694 --> 01:09:56.518]  You could buy cocaine, heroin, speed, anything under different names at the drugstore.
[01:09:57.478 --> 01:10:02.541]  You would go and get coke syrup, cocaine syrup, shot into your, quote, tonic.
[01:10:03.021 --> 01:10:04.182]  That's where soft drinks came from.
[01:10:06.027 --> 01:10:12.331]  I know I had family that, you know, basically worked in that business up in Waco, where Dr. Pepper comes from.
[01:10:12.632 --> 01:10:13.773]  It had cocaine in it, too.
[01:10:13.793 --> 01:10:16.555]  In fact, one of my ancestors actually named Dr. Pepper.
[01:10:17.495 --> 01:10:20.117]  The point is, doctor will pep you up.
[01:10:20.718 --> 01:10:23.300]  So, this guy's been a Dr. Pepper as well.
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:33.908]  You make it illegal, though, it brings all the prostitution, it brings all the money laundering, it brings all the exploitation into it and makes it dirty.
[01:10:34.568 --> 01:10:37.171]  And how are you going to legalize slavery again in this country?
[01:10:37.191 --> 01:10:43.037]  How are you going to scoop up 3, 4, 5 million people and throw them in jail every year and take their rights away?
[01:10:43.338 --> 01:10:45.360]  You do it by putting something highly addictive.
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:46.401]  Beer's addictive.
[01:10:46.421 --> 01:10:47.462]  We're going to lock them up for that?
[01:10:48.103 --> 01:10:48.924]  Fast food's addictive.
[01:10:48.944 --> 01:10:49.905]  We're going to lock you up for that?
[01:10:51.266 --> 01:10:55.391]  They throw it out, hope people pick up the adulterated poison,
[01:10:56.906 --> 01:10:57.106]  I think?
[01:11:18.937 --> 01:11:19.437]  On record.
[01:11:20.278 --> 01:11:22.480]  And Rick Ross could have shot up about the CIA.
[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:23.440]  He could have gone along.
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:25.362]  They wouldn't have given him a life sentence.
[01:11:25.382 --> 01:11:27.163]  I remember interviewing Gary Webb.
[01:11:27.183 --> 01:11:30.926]  He's got the big Renner film out right now.
[01:11:32.146 --> 01:11:34.388]  Of course, kill the messenger, dealing with it.
[01:11:35.229 --> 01:11:37.030]  And I remember talking to Webb.
[01:11:37.050 --> 01:11:38.411]  He was going to come on in a few months.
[01:11:39.091 --> 01:11:41.153]  And he gave me a disc with all his documents.
[01:11:42.694 --> 01:11:47.316]  And he was going to have a new book coming out to vindicate everything he'd done, everything he'd said.
[01:11:47.656 --> 01:11:50.117]  He won all sorts of prizes, you name it.
[01:11:50.417 --> 01:11:55.819]  But his editors and the LA Times, run by the CIA, that was declassified two months ago.
[01:11:56.239 --> 01:11:58.920]  The CIA did target him with a disinformation campaign.
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.940]  They did lie and say he was discredited.
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:03.541]  He would never admit he was discredited because it wasn't true.
[01:12:03.861 --> 01:12:06.342]  And before he could vindicate himself, they killed him.
[01:12:06.382 --> 01:12:11.344]  Now, why would the CIA declassify that a month before the film came out two months ago?
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:16.784]  Why would they do something like that?
[01:12:16.804 --> 01:12:21.290]  Well, I'm gonna ask Rick Ross that question, but...
[01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:25.713]  I really think it's because it's already so well known.
[01:12:25.773 --> 01:12:34.280]  It's even on Fox News that our troops grow the opium and load it on C-130s and then it comes here and then it goes through people like Ross that are intermediaries.
[01:12:35.081 --> 01:12:39.665]  It goes CIA to the black front because it's the black man bringing us the drugs.
[01:12:40.146 --> 01:12:40.906]  He's the bad guy.
[01:12:41.667 --> 01:12:42.628]  Not the CIA.
[01:12:43.409 --> 01:12:44.430]  Not the establishment.
[01:12:45.874 --> 01:12:47.555]  It's the Tony Montana type.
[01:12:47.935 --> 01:12:48.696]  It's the Cuban.
[01:12:48.716 --> 01:12:49.436]  He's behind it.
[01:12:49.496 --> 01:12:50.157]  It's the black guy.
[01:12:50.457 --> 01:12:54.320]  Or it's the white trash guy in the trailer selling the drugs.
[01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:54.820]  No, it's not.
[01:12:57.222 --> 01:12:59.843]  And as the economy shuts down, more people want the drugs.
[01:13:00.064 --> 01:13:01.204]  Your daughter gets hooked on them.
[01:13:01.645 --> 01:13:03.246]  Now she's a topless dancer.
[01:13:03.266 --> 01:13:04.026]  Then she's a hooker.
[01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:06.668]  This is how you bring down society.
[01:13:07.028 --> 01:13:10.190]  And then you've got SWAT teams running around paramilitary for the war on drugs.
[01:13:10.210 --> 01:13:12.212]  You've got the Patriot Act they're using for the war on drugs.
[01:13:12.512 --> 01:13:15.394]  Merging it all together so everyone's under suspicion.
[01:13:17.216 --> 01:13:19.959]  Your daughter hurts her back in a volleyball accident.
[01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:21.981]  What does that one of my friends when she's 16?
[01:13:22.242 --> 01:13:23.723]  Two years later is addicted to pain pills.
[01:13:24.684 --> 01:13:26.406]  Goes around doctor shopping to get the things.
[01:13:26.426 --> 01:13:28.528]  Instead of getting treatment, they throw her in jail.
[01:13:29.169 --> 01:13:30.410]  Then she gets in with bad people.
[01:13:31.271 --> 01:13:37.879]  Next she comes out with an education in criminal activity after a year and becomes, you guessed it, a streetwalker.
[01:13:38.769 --> 01:13:41.772]  This is how you kill a civilization.
[01:13:41.972 --> 01:13:44.474]  This is how you annihilate a culture.
[01:13:44.674 --> 01:13:46.656]  This is how you bring a country down.
[01:13:47.016 --> 01:13:57.986]  So a minority of people in the YouTube comments and on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com said, what are you doing having a huge cocaine dealer on your show?
[01:13:59.808 --> 01:14:02.871]  Okay, what are you doing putting up with a government that went and hired him?
[01:14:04.454 --> 01:14:05.815]  See, there's no outrage about that.
[01:14:06.195 --> 01:14:10.357]  There's no outrage about the big banks laundering $386 billion in two years.
[01:14:10.657 --> 01:14:12.398]  Bloomberg reported, two banks alone.
[01:14:12.899 --> 01:14:16.160]  Wells Fargo, Wachovia, $380 plus billion.
[01:14:16.441 --> 01:14:16.921]  Type it in.
[01:14:17.521 --> 01:14:20.003]  Big banks laundered $300 plus billion.
[01:14:20.183 --> 01:14:22.904]  It'll pop up Bloomberg, AP, you name it, from four years ago.
[01:14:23.064 --> 01:14:23.805]  That's just one admission.
[01:14:23.965 --> 01:14:24.665]  They paid a $111 million fine.
[01:14:26.817 --> 01:14:29.418]  That's like if you rob a bank for a million bucks paying a $3,000 fine.
[01:14:29.998 --> 01:14:31.619]  It's a slap on the wrist.
[01:14:31.939 --> 01:14:35.781]  It's not a slap on the wrist, it's like them flicking a penny after they rob the bank to the cops.
[01:14:36.021 --> 01:14:40.083]  You walk out, the cops open the truck up, help you load the stolen money, and you throw them a quarter.
[01:14:41.083 --> 01:14:42.164]  That's what this is.
[01:14:42.244 --> 01:14:43.564]  That's how this system works.
[01:14:44.024 --> 01:14:52.368]  And now it's expanding the racket with all the psych testing in the schools and the drugging of the kids that way to get them into the system.
[01:14:55.473 --> 01:14:56.974]  I am the real Rick Ross dot com.
[01:14:57.014 --> 01:14:58.254]  Freeway Rick dot com.
[01:14:58.794 --> 01:15:00.095]  Freeway Rick Ross.
[01:15:01.155 --> 01:15:07.057]  And I'm not going to go over his whole bio, but in 96 they were getting, he hadn't dealt drugs in years, they were getting rid of everybody.
[01:15:07.077 --> 01:15:09.338]  See, they always flush the people that work for him.
[01:15:09.598 --> 01:15:15.060]  He was sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of trying to purchase more than 100 kilograms of cocaine from a federal agent.
[01:15:15.421 --> 01:15:24.264]  Ross became the subject of a controversy later that year when a series of articles by journalist Gary Webb and the San Jose Mercury brought to light the connection between one of Ross' cocaine sources
[01:15:25.612 --> 01:15:28.253]  And the CIA as part of the Iran-Contra scandal.
[01:15:28.613 --> 01:15:33.816]  His sentencing was later reduced to less than 20 years and released in September 2009.
[01:15:33.976 --> 01:15:38.518]  He's finally off the probation, the harassment, all of it.
[01:15:38.818 --> 01:15:40.298]  Able to put his book out that's excellent.
[01:15:40.518 --> 01:15:43.120]  We're selling it at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:45.681]  Even if you already know all this, give this to friends and family.
[01:15:46.021 --> 01:15:52.744]  He is currently in the process of creating a feature-length film for his live story, Cracking the System, and creating his
[01:15:53.564 --> 01:16:05.601]  Autobiography of a book which is now out and that is Freeway Rick Ross the Untold Autobiography by Rick Ross with Kathy Scott available right now at InfoWarsTore.com or by calling 888-253-3139
[01:16:09.318 --> 01:16:11.941]  I admire Rick Ross, because I talked to Gary Webb about it.
[01:16:12.341 --> 01:16:17.046]  When this came out about the CIA and his trial, he didn't really know about it, he was blown away, everything suddenly made sense.
[01:16:17.767 --> 01:16:21.851]  They said, just shut up, don't cooperate with this reporter and people, and we'll go easy.
[01:16:22.111 --> 01:16:23.913]  He didn't, so they gave him life in prison.
[01:16:24.273 --> 01:16:27.576]  That was clearly done politically, so it was reduced.
[01:16:28.530 --> 01:16:29.851]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:16:29.911 --> 01:16:31.691]  The issue is he's repented of it.
[01:16:32.072 --> 01:16:34.233]  The CIA and the New World Order haven't.
[01:16:34.793 --> 01:16:38.555]  So he joins us now until the end of the transmission, the next hour and 45 minutes.
[01:16:38.775 --> 01:16:41.116]  We'll open the phones up for Rick Ross next hour.
[01:16:41.496 --> 01:16:44.838]  But Rick, it was like sunny and 80 degrees a few days ago.
[01:16:45.158 --> 01:16:49.820]  Sorry you gotta be in Austin when this global warming cold front hits, but thank you so much for coming.
[01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:52.383]  No, I'm just blown away to be here.
[01:16:52.463 --> 01:16:59.493]  I remember when I was in prison, and you tried to come down to see me and make sure that I was okay.
[01:16:59.733 --> 01:17:04.820]  And it was one of my dreams to sit here with you in the studio, and here I am today.
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.522]  And I'm just blown away, man.
[01:17:06.582 --> 01:17:07.363]  And thanks for...
[01:17:09.244 --> 01:17:09.985]  For still having me here.
[01:17:10.265 --> 01:17:11.126]  Oh, it's awesome to have you.
[01:17:11.206 --> 01:17:13.688]  And you're speaking to college students all over the country.
[01:17:13.708 --> 01:17:16.431]  You're speaking to the Black Congressional Congress Press Club.
[01:17:16.911 --> 01:17:18.713]  You were at the premiere with Renner of the film.
[01:17:18.953 --> 01:17:21.095]  I mean, you're having a big effect now.
[01:17:21.695 --> 01:17:23.978]  And that is so exciting that you can really educate people.
[01:17:23.998 --> 01:17:27.581]  Because back when this all first came out, people didn't believe the CIA was bringing drugs in.
[01:17:27.781 --> 01:17:28.342]  I didn't believe it.
[01:17:29.207 --> 01:17:35.934]  I mean, I'm gonna be honest with you, even when Gary reported the story and I was like, this guy Gary, what is he talking about?
[01:17:35.974 --> 01:17:38.778]  I was involved with the CIA and no way.
[01:17:40.099 --> 01:17:47.767]  It wasn't until the CIA themselves told me that they were involved and put out their report.
[01:17:47.827 --> 01:17:49.009]  I mean, that was when I really
[01:17:49.781 --> 01:17:52.223]  When it really hit me that, hey, Gary was right.
[01:17:52.783 --> 01:17:55.085]  You know, because, I mean, it was just hard for me to believe.
[01:17:55.145 --> 01:18:01.270]  How can a little guy like me, who wasn't supposed to succeed, couldn't read, couldn't write, high school dropout.
[01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:06.074]  I mean, how could I, you know, be involved with something this big?
[01:18:06.174 --> 01:18:09.436]  I mean, it was just like totally shocking to me.
[01:18:09.597 --> 01:18:10.457]  I'll be honest with you.
[01:18:11.278 --> 01:18:12.459]  Let's start at the beginning.
[01:18:14.958 --> 01:18:28.913]  And in the few minutes we have before break, start at the beginning of your life, your life, get into how you got into drug dealing, how you suddenly found this incredible source that made you the biggest dealer on the West Coast, and then we'll lead right through your trial, prison, the drug war, and phone calls.
[01:18:29.294 --> 01:18:30.095]  All right, let's do that.
[01:18:30.115 --> 01:18:32.437]  Well, you know, I was born here in Texas, Tyler.
[01:18:35.447 --> 01:18:35.768]  This is
[01:18:50.589 --> 01:18:54.171]  I got to see the Black Panthers and, you know, I used to want to be a Panther.
[01:18:54.691 --> 01:19:02.474]  So I go to school and, you know, trying to be like any other normal kid, you know, want to be a police officer, a firefighter, an airplane pilot.
[01:19:03.675 --> 01:19:09.998]  Started playing tennis in high school, you know, did pretty good, made All-City, was offered scholarships, but I couldn't read or write.
[01:19:11.138 --> 01:19:14.560]  So when it was time to take the scholarships, I couldn't go to college.
[01:19:15.495 --> 01:19:22.460]  So I found myself with the one thing that I thought that I could count on was my tennis to get me out the ghetto.
[01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:27.143]  And I found that that was no longer an option for me.
[01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:30.505]  So I found myself back in the streets in South Central Los Angeles.
[01:19:31.932 --> 01:19:40.195]  So I'm walking around trying to figure out, you know, what was I gonna do with myself and couldn't get a job, you know, even though I was a very hard worker.
[01:19:40.595 --> 01:19:49.919]  I had no problem, you know, rolling up my sleeves and doing whatever, car washing, taking out trash, any number of things.
[01:19:49.959 --> 01:19:53.360]  Just anything that I could do to start making a living, I was willing to do it.
[01:19:54.141 --> 01:20:00.223]  Well, one of my friends came from college and he had this stuff called cocaine.
[01:20:01.883 --> 01:20:02.484]  Stay right there.
[01:20:02.504 --> 01:20:06.490]  We're going to come back there and start with your friend from college coming back.
[01:20:07.091 --> 01:20:08.332]  Freeway Rick Ross is our guest.

[01:21:27.787 --> 01:21:35.673]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:21:35.913 --> 01:21:40.136]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:21:40.416 --> 01:21:44.260]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:50.105]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.

[01:24:39.228 --> 01:24:45.334]  The real Rick Ross, Freeway Rick Ross, became the biggest cocaine dealer on the West Coast on record.
[01:24:46.496 --> 01:24:56.100]  It became the heart of an investigation that later the CIA Inspector General had to admit that the CIA was involved in bringing in the majority of the cocaine, at least the West Coast.
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:57.360]  It's much bigger than that.
[01:24:57.420 --> 01:24:58.261]  Meno, Arkansas.
[01:24:58.661 --> 01:25:01.542]  I've interviewed the pilots that were there unloading the cocaine.
[01:25:01.842 --> 01:25:10.726]  Not just Tosh Plumlee, who's on record Iran-Contra testimony, but just so many others that were there and saw
[01:25:11.994 --> 01:25:12.575]  I don't
[01:25:28.479 --> 01:25:31.023]  I mean, a lot of people have died over this information.
[01:25:31.043 --> 01:25:32.085]  I hope you understand this.
[01:25:32.826 --> 01:25:34.809]  And everybody today is like, yeah, we know they bring it in.
[01:25:34.849 --> 01:25:35.349]  Well, wait.
[01:25:35.690 --> 01:25:37.433]  We didn't know this back in the 90s.
[01:25:38.194 --> 01:25:42.420]  There'd been the heroin coming in out of Southeast Asia, but they'd blame a colonel or somebody.
[01:25:42.921 --> 01:25:43.922]  This is organized.
[01:25:44.543 --> 01:25:45.324]  This is a short segment.
[01:25:45.344 --> 01:25:47.545]  I want to go back to you, Rick Roskin.
[01:25:47.626 --> 01:25:48.886]  It's great to have you here, my friend.
[01:25:48.927 --> 01:25:49.787]  I appreciate your courage.
[01:25:50.167 --> 01:25:53.670]  And you're not selling out and getting that longer sentence for not backing down.
[01:25:54.171 --> 01:25:57.393]  But let's get into now where you left off.
[01:25:57.593 --> 01:26:00.535]  You can't get a job that pays well.
[01:26:00.595 --> 01:26:01.716]  You don't have a criminal record.
[01:26:02.657 --> 01:26:05.279]  You could have got a scholarship, but you couldn't read and write for tennis.
[01:26:05.559 --> 01:26:07.060]  And then your friend comes back from college.
[01:26:07.641 --> 01:26:10.163]  Yeah, so he introduces me to cocaine for the first time.
[01:26:11.865 --> 01:26:16.901]  But what I also noticed Alex, you know when I was in prison I did a lot of thinking back and I can remember when...
[01:26:17.805 --> 01:26:26.989]  Before I started selling cocaine, you know, they started coming out with movies like Superfly and almost like priming you up for this lifestyle that you're about to get into.
[01:26:28.469 --> 01:26:32.651]  So when my friend comes and shows me cocaine, I'm interested because I saw Superfly.
[01:26:32.791 --> 01:26:33.611]  What you hit is key.
[01:26:33.671 --> 01:26:35.292]  The CIA has now declassified that.
[01:26:35.612 --> 01:26:40.014]  Rock and roll, the drug culture, the CIA delivered the first suitcases of LSD.
[01:26:41.054 --> 01:26:42.495]  White kids weren't smoking marijuana.
[01:26:42.795 --> 01:26:43.475]  They delivered it.
[01:26:43.815 --> 01:26:44.576]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:26:44.596 --> 01:26:45.616]  They primed the whole deal.
[01:26:45.856 --> 01:26:46.597]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:26:46.677 --> 01:26:53.464]  It's almost like they get your mind ready so that when you get the opportunity that you're interested in... It's called predictive programming.
[01:26:53.484 --> 01:26:55.086]  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[01:26:55.106 --> 01:26:56.247]  It's just what you're saying is absolutely right.
[01:26:56.448 --> 01:26:59.831]  So, when my friend comes and he shows me this stuff, I've never seen it before.
[01:27:00.595 --> 01:27:01.275]  It was yellowish.
[01:27:01.775 --> 01:27:02.415]  Yellowish white.
[01:27:02.435 --> 01:27:05.036]  And I'm like, well I thought cocaine was supposed to be white.
[01:27:05.816 --> 01:27:07.116]  He's like, no man, this is it.
[01:27:07.296 --> 01:27:08.376]  So he introduces it to me.
[01:27:08.396 --> 01:27:10.297]  He gives me a little bit, like $50 worth.
[01:27:10.777 --> 01:27:12.117]  He said, go and see what you can do with it.
[01:27:12.537 --> 01:27:14.498]  So I go around the neighborhood and I'm asking everybody.
[01:27:14.518 --> 01:27:15.598]  Nobody knows what it is.
[01:27:15.938 --> 01:27:17.658]  I mean, I'm going all over South Central LA.
[01:27:18.218 --> 01:27:19.359]  Finally, I run into a guy.
[01:27:19.399 --> 01:27:19.959]  He was a pimp.
[01:27:20.519 --> 01:27:21.519]  And he says, let me see it.
[01:27:22.479 --> 01:27:26.320]  And he takes it and he cooks it up and he says, oh yeah, it's pretty good stuff.
[01:27:27.153 --> 01:27:29.114]  And that's how I got started selling cocaine.
[01:27:29.134 --> 01:27:39.041]  And it went from there to this one person would buy from me and then another one would come and he would introduce me to somebody else until up, you know, some days I'm making three million dollars a day.
[01:27:39.981 --> 01:27:41.623]  So you got in on the ground floor of it?
[01:27:42.103 --> 01:27:43.084]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:27:43.144 --> 01:27:43.744]  Totally ground.
[01:27:45.045 --> 01:27:45.945]  Was totally a novice.
[01:27:46.426 --> 01:27:47.787]  I had never smoked pot.
[01:27:47.967 --> 01:27:53.671]  At that time I was still tinkering on being a tennis player, you know, like, I don't know if you're gonna make it in tennis, you know.
[01:27:54.878 --> 01:27:55.678]  But you gotta do something.
[01:27:55.698 --> 01:27:58.059]  You know, my mom's on my back right now because I'm living with my mom.
[01:27:58.139 --> 01:27:59.419]  I'm not bringing in any income.
[01:28:00.139 --> 01:28:01.380]  And she's really going hard on me.
[01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:02.560]  You know, you're a bum.
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:04.180]  You're not going to be doing nothing with your life.
[01:28:06.181 --> 01:28:07.841]  So I desperately want to do something now.
[01:28:08.302 --> 01:28:09.582]  I need to make some money somewhere.
[01:28:10.042 --> 01:28:14.123]  So when this opportunity came, you know, I thought that it was a blessing from God.
[01:28:14.163 --> 01:28:16.744]  You know, I started off just helping Mike, who was my friend.
[01:28:16.944 --> 01:28:19.404]  You know, I'd make the money for him, give him all the money.
[01:28:19.905 --> 01:28:21.265]  And pretty soon I know the business.
[01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:29.412]  It goes from there, from making $50 a week to, you know, like I said, $3 million a day sometimes.
[01:28:29.432 --> 01:28:35.673]  In fact, I was reading sometimes you were bringing in $30 million a deal every few days.
[01:28:36.354 --> 01:28:37.054]  Well, yeah.
[01:28:37.154 --> 01:28:44.236]  I mean, if you add up 10 days, you know, you do 10 days worth of dealing, you know, you're talking about $10 million or more.
[01:28:44.416 --> 01:28:45.536]  No, like $30 million.
[01:28:45.696 --> 01:28:46.376]  And this is 1980s money?
[01:28:46.416 --> 01:28:47.116]  Yeah, 80s money.
[01:28:47.136 --> 01:28:47.557]  84-ish, 85, 86.
[01:28:53.857 --> 01:28:56.641]  So you were there when folks didn't even know what cocaine was?
[01:28:57.523 --> 01:29:00.107]  In my community, nobody, nobody knew what cocaine was.
[01:29:00.127 --> 01:29:01.629]  Yeah, it was a rich white guy drug.
[01:29:02.110 --> 01:29:02.871]  Well, that's how I felt.
[01:29:02.951 --> 01:29:07.378]  You know, I felt that when I first started selling cocaine, I felt that it was another
[01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:10.121]  Because I've been discriminated against.
[01:29:10.241 --> 01:29:16.546]  You know, I've been to a hospital and they said, oh no, you can't sit right there because this is a white only section.
[01:29:16.566 --> 01:29:17.487]  You have to go to the back.
[01:29:17.527 --> 01:29:20.109]  So when I started selling cocaine, that's how I felt about cocaine.
[01:29:20.129 --> 01:29:24.292]  That it was another one of those things that they said, no, this is for white people and you guys can't have it.
[01:29:24.353 --> 01:29:28.076]  So I felt like I was bringing cocaine to my community to give us something.
[01:29:28.536 --> 01:29:30.477]  But the CIA said, oh, you blacks want it?
[01:29:30.497 --> 01:29:32.079]  We're going to make something special for you.
[01:29:32.259 --> 01:29:33.280]  Here's how you make crack.
[01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:35.161]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:29:36.582 --> 01:29:36.883]  Totally.
[01:29:37.645 --> 01:29:40.212]  Makes it hit harder, be more addictive, turn people into zombies.
[01:29:40.493 --> 01:29:42.258]  Yeah, I mean that's what happened.
[01:29:43.762 --> 01:29:44.645]  Exactly how it turned out.
[01:29:45.823 --> 01:29:46.504]  Unbelievable.
[01:29:46.744 --> 01:29:47.825]  We're gonna break it all down.
[01:29:47.845 --> 01:29:49.146]  18-minute segment coming up.
[01:29:49.166 --> 01:29:49.906]  You're gonna get the floor.
[01:29:50.166 --> 01:29:51.007]  Get ready to roll.
[01:29:51.467 --> 01:29:52.608]  Just go through it all.
[01:29:52.728 --> 01:29:53.929]  Rick Ross is our guest.
[01:29:54.289 --> 01:29:57.752]  Ground level of the CIA crack cocaine epidemic.
[01:29:58.292 --> 01:30:01.514]  And then all of a sudden, years after he's out of it, they want to get rid of all the loose ends.
[01:30:01.534 --> 01:30:03.075]  They're trying to throw him in jail.
[01:30:03.536 --> 01:30:06.318]  Turns out all the people involved, they all knew what was going on.
[01:30:06.338 --> 01:30:07.979]  The CIA came to visit him.
[01:30:08.219 --> 01:30:09.100]  Said, shut your mouth.
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:12.566]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:13.487 --> 01:30:16.172]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:24.214]  On the eve of Thanksgiving this year, I was thinking, what am I really thankful for?
[01:30:24.414 --> 01:30:32.542]  And I gotta tell you, it's my family, it's all the blessings of liberty that our forebearers secured, and it's you, the listeners of the broadcast, who've made everything we do possible.
[01:30:32.682 --> 01:30:40.610]  This Black Friday, I decided to bring you the biggest special we've ever offered on any of the Nutraceuticals at Infowarslife.com.
[01:30:41.050 --> 01:30:44.811]  I'm talking about Silver Bullet colloidal silver that we've been sold out of for months.
[01:30:45.071 --> 01:30:46.952]  This time I doubled down and got even more.
[01:30:47.252 --> 01:30:50.733]  As of me taping this on the eve of Thanksgiving, we have already sold half of it.
[01:30:50.813 --> 01:30:57.995]  So instead of keeping the price at its regular discounted price, we are going to give you 20% off and free shipping on single bottles.
[01:30:58.155 --> 01:31:01.556]  But if you get four bottles, we're gonna give you the fifth one free and the free shipping.
[01:31:01.676 --> 01:31:06.278]  I don't know how long this special will run, but if supplies last, we will extend it out until Cyber Monday.
[01:31:06.398 --> 01:31:10.159]  You'll find powerful nutraceuticals like Silver Bullet and others at InfoWars.com.
[01:31:10.279 --> 01:31:11.701]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[01:31:11.721 --> 01:31:14.724]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:26.555 --> 01:31:30.877]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[01:31:31.018 --> 01:31:37.821]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[01:31:38.341 --> 01:31:47.426]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:47.626 --> 01:31:53.028]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[01:31:53.168 --> 01:32:00.430]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.
[01:32:00.770 --> 01:32:03.050]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:08.452]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the Info War.
[01:32:08.812 --> 01:32:15.836]  Secure your DNA Force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:32:16.697 --> 01:32:18.798]  DNA Force from Infowarslife.
[01:32:20.359 --> 01:32:25.783]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:32:27.023 --> 01:32:31.766]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:32:32.167 --> 01:32:34.008]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:32:36.226 --> 01:32:47.234]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[01:32:49.358 --> 01:33:00.901]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:33:01.161 --> 01:33:02.681]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:33:02.961 --> 01:33:05.522]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:33:05.822 --> 01:33:12.083]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:33:12.463 --> 01:33:14.664]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:33:15.164 --> 01:33:16.584]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:33:16.745 --> 01:33:17.185]  Got it.
[01:33:17.545 --> 01:33:18.325]  Others don't.
[01:33:23.729 --> 01:33:28.832]  I'm beginning a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own.
[01:33:28.872 --> 01:33:44.501]  I've also directed Secretary Johnson and Attorney General Holder to identify additional actions my administration can take on our own, within my existing legal authorities, to do what Congress refuses to do and fix as much of our immigration system as we can.
[01:33:45.182 --> 01:33:50.125]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:57.841]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:58.001 --> 01:34:01.503]  We've got Rick Ross with us for the entire third hour coming up.
[01:34:02.024 --> 01:34:06.967]  About 20 minutes into that hour, I'm going to open the phones up for your questions for Freeway Rick Ross.
[01:34:07.747 --> 01:34:08.828]  And he is here with us.
[01:34:08.908 --> 01:34:12.990]  We are selling his amazing untold story autobiography.
[01:34:13.771 --> 01:34:14.912]  It is available.
[01:34:16.098 --> 01:34:21.421]  At InfowarsStore.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:34:21.441 --> 01:34:25.062]  And you need to give this to young people you know.
[01:34:25.743 --> 01:34:28.424]  You need to give this to police officers you know.
[01:34:28.464 --> 01:34:29.985]  You need to give this to preachers you know.
[01:34:30.545 --> 01:34:36.868]  It is so immoral and hypocritical if the preacher gets up in the pulpit and gives an anti-drug sermon, which I think they should.
[01:34:38.377 --> 01:34:42.901]  Drugs, whether they're prescription or illicit, are just super destructive.
[01:34:42.941 --> 01:34:43.662]  Everybody knows that.
[01:34:44.363 --> 01:34:46.725]  I mean, sure, some opiate pills are fine if your leg's broken.
[01:34:46.745 --> 01:34:49.347]  You had surgery, but it just wrecks people's lives.
[01:34:50.128 --> 01:35:00.257]  They are making this stuff illegal so they can make money in the black market, no pun intended, and then still put you in prison.
[01:35:00.738 --> 01:35:02.439]  This is a social engineering plan.
[01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:03.861]  Also,
[01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:07.952]  It's part of the social engineering with the GMO and the additives in the food and water.
[01:35:08.192 --> 01:35:10.194]  They don't want you getting all natural healthy things.
[01:35:10.514 --> 01:35:22.663]  They don't want you knowing that they've taken the good halogen iodine out of the salt and food and bread and put the bad halogens of bromine, bromide and fluoride in to just fry your glands.
[01:35:22.683 --> 01:35:26.285]  They don't want you to know about Survival Shield X2, nascent iodine.
[01:35:26.325 --> 01:35:28.587]  We're the only company that has the deep earth crystal source.
[01:35:28.927 --> 01:35:31.189]  All the rest is a seaweed source, which is still great.
[01:35:31.889 --> 01:35:35.052]  Sea salt's great if it's all you can get, or the seaweed-based stuff.
[01:35:35.072 --> 01:35:36.774]  That's what I first got on and changed my life.
[01:35:36.954 --> 01:35:38.315]  Helped me lose a bunch of weight and get healthier.
[01:35:38.696 --> 01:35:40.357]  But man, when I got on the Crystal Source X2...
[01:35:42.438 --> 01:35:44.279]  Group have been trying to get a source of this for years.
[01:35:44.999 --> 01:35:45.560]  Dr. Group.
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:48.621]  And then finally, a couple years ago, had it and took him years to get it together.
[01:35:48.641 --> 01:35:52.223]  And, I mean, you gotta jump through DEA hoops, you name it, to get iodine.
[01:35:52.624 --> 01:35:54.625]  Because it's a very powerful substance.
[01:35:55.085 --> 01:35:57.206]  The type we use is the crystal source.
[01:35:57.266 --> 01:35:59.007]  It turns into purple gas.
[01:35:59.627 --> 01:36:01.428]  If you put it on a hot plate, we have video of it.
[01:36:02.229 --> 01:36:03.349]  I mean, it's that pure.
[01:36:03.369 --> 01:36:05.210]  200 million year old.
[01:36:07.074 --> 01:36:08.475]  Unbelievable what it does in your body.
[01:36:08.615 --> 01:36:11.016]  Just get ready for all the oil to come out all the time.
[01:36:11.056 --> 01:36:13.497]  What has done for me and my family has been sensational.
[01:36:13.917 --> 01:36:18.018]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:36:18.038 --> 01:36:22.040]  I got some good news and some bad news.
[01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:24.041]  It is going to sell out by the end of the week.
[01:36:24.621 --> 01:36:27.102]  The good news is it may only take three weeks to get more in.
[01:36:28.102 --> 01:36:34.905]  So if you want Survival Shield X2 discounted 10%, we're just keeping that discount until it sells out when you get it with the Lung Cleanse.
[01:36:34.925 --> 01:36:36.306]  It's part of the Biodefense Pack.
[01:36:37.881 --> 01:36:38.141]  10% off.
[01:36:38.641 --> 01:36:44.863]  You can also use the promo code NOW and get 5% off all the other products that are already discounted.
[01:36:45.203 --> 01:36:50.125]  DNA Force, Oxy Powder, already the lowest price on Oxy Powder, but 5% off promo code now.
[01:36:50.505 --> 01:36:52.365]  Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality.
[01:36:52.825 --> 01:36:57.307]  And again, this doesn't mimic testosterone, the concentrated organic herbs that are in there.
[01:36:57.767 --> 01:37:01.408]  It's stuff that's been developed to get your body to release what you're already supposed to have.
[01:37:02.068 --> 01:37:06.551]  With all the chemicals and the estrogen mimickers that are really screwing men up particularly.
[01:37:06.831 --> 01:37:09.732]  Then the formulations for women to help get them cleaned up.
[01:37:09.772 --> 01:37:10.793]  And you've heard the rave reviews.
[01:37:11.173 --> 01:37:12.314]  We are self-funding here.
[01:37:12.754 --> 01:37:16.416]  I fund this whole operation off books, videos, t-shirts, sponsors.
[01:37:16.916 --> 01:37:19.017]  We're not like NPR getting public money.
[01:37:19.057 --> 01:37:20.938]  We're not like MSNBC getting stimulus money.
[01:37:21.639 --> 01:37:23.900]  Our parent company isn't some weapons manufacturer.
[01:37:24.340 --> 01:37:28.723]  This is an operation set up by me, Alex Jones, to try to promote the truth.
[01:37:29.403 --> 01:37:31.304]  Because the truth will set us free as Christ said.
[01:37:31.644 --> 01:37:33.606]  So Freeway Rick Ross is our guest.
[01:37:33.666 --> 01:37:34.766]  FreewayRick.com.
[01:37:34.786 --> 01:37:36.087]  You can get his book there as well.
[01:37:36.528 --> 01:37:38.989]  Or at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:37:39.449 --> 01:37:42.712]  Find the supplements at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:37:44.933 --> 01:37:46.754]  Or again, the book at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:37:46.774 --> 01:37:48.195]  And please remember to support our local A.M.
[01:37:48.215 --> 01:37:48.475]  and F.M.
[01:37:48.515 --> 01:37:49.016]  affiliates.
[01:37:50.016 --> 01:37:53.338]  Whether it's Oklahoma City or... I haven't plugged some of these new affiliates.
[01:37:53.358 --> 01:37:56.000]  We've got one, a new one in Chicago, on top of our other affiliate.
[01:37:56.981 --> 01:37:57.961]  And we've also got...
[01:37:59.662 --> 01:38:01.163]  Jasper, Texas just turned us on.
[01:38:01.183 --> 01:38:04.024]  It's like five or six new affiliates the last two weeks and I haven't plugged them.
[01:38:04.604 --> 01:38:05.585]  They've told me to plug them.
[01:38:05.625 --> 01:38:11.468]  If you print those out again, I'll actually mention those on air, but please tell friends and family about the show if you're listening to it.
[01:38:11.708 --> 01:38:14.729]  It's a big deal that a show telling the truth like this can be heard.
[01:38:15.069 --> 01:38:15.990]  It's all word of mouth.
[01:38:16.770 --> 01:38:21.992]  Please support their local sponsors, please tell them why you're supporting the sponsors, or become a sponsor.
[01:38:22.012 --> 01:38:31.275]  If you're a car dealership, or a restaurant, or a bookstore, or a maid service, or a hotel, whatever, you better support it.
[01:38:31.515 --> 01:38:37.877]  That's why we've gone from being on the weekends, to weeknights, to primetime, on almost every affiliate that picks up our show.
[01:38:38.437 --> 01:38:42.318]  It's because you have been supporting it, so you're the reason we're reaching more people.
[01:38:42.358 --> 01:38:44.159]  Now Rick Ross, you've got the floor.
[01:38:45.325 --> 01:38:50.132]  You've told the story, biggest cocaine dealer in West Coast history, when it came out in your trial.
[01:38:51.561 --> 01:38:58.944]  That the prosecution knew, the government knew, the DEA knew, the CIA knew, that you were one of their main distributors, but you didn't even know.
[01:38:58.964 --> 01:39:05.387]  I want to get into that relationship and more, but you've gotten to the point in a few years to where, you know, tell the story.
[01:39:05.427 --> 01:39:06.368]  Did you ever use?
[01:39:06.688 --> 01:39:07.968]  Why were you so successful?
[01:39:08.489 --> 01:39:15.592]  And then go ahead and walk through everything that happened, and then now what your message is to the youth about what's really going on, and we'll talk about Gary Webb.
[01:39:15.712 --> 01:39:18.293]  Well, I did start using for a short time.
[01:39:18.373 --> 01:39:20.274]  You know, I got up to a point to where
[01:39:21.653 --> 01:39:23.594]  I probably had about eight or nine thousand dollars.
[01:39:23.654 --> 01:39:24.434]  I thought I was rich.
[01:39:25.715 --> 01:39:29.376]  So, you know, when you're rich, you start experimenting, you know, with the drugs.
[01:39:31.197 --> 01:39:32.698]  And I looked up, all my money was gone.
[01:39:34.138 --> 01:39:35.479]  So I immediately quit using.
[01:39:35.819 --> 01:39:37.820]  You know, I went back and regrouped.
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:38.940]  You know, I learned that from tennis.
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:42.602]  When you're doing something wrong, you go back and you figure out what you're doing wrong.
[01:39:42.622 --> 01:39:44.382]  So I figured out that I couldn't use anymore.
[01:39:44.903 --> 01:39:46.583]  If I wanted to be rich, I had to stop using.
[01:39:46.623 --> 01:39:49.044]  So I stopped using and I went on to get rich.
[01:39:50.065 --> 01:39:50.265]  Well,
[01:39:51.181 --> 01:39:51.901]  I made a lot of money.
[01:39:52.682 --> 01:39:55.163]  You know, like I said, I made three million dollars a day sometimes.
[01:39:55.183 --> 01:40:00.106]  And then it got to the point to where I started seeing the effects that cocaine was having inside of my community.
[01:40:00.627 --> 01:40:04.749]  And it wasn't the effects that I initially thought that it was going to have.
[01:40:04.929 --> 01:40:06.950]  You know, I started seeing people pushing baskets.
[01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:11.173]  I started seeing women walking the streets and women doing anything to get high.
[01:40:11.813 --> 01:40:14.095]  And I started to rethink my position.
[01:40:14.855 --> 01:40:15.515]  That was around
[01:40:18.437 --> 01:40:21.219]  88, 89.
[01:40:19.938 --> 01:40:21.219]  At that time, I threw my hands up.
[01:40:21.299 --> 01:40:21.939]  I said, you know what?
[01:40:21.959 --> 01:40:23.220]  I'm through with the cocaine business.
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:24.020]  I got enough money.
[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:26.642]  I got more money now than I ever thought that I would have in my life.
[01:40:26.682 --> 01:40:27.482]  I got businesses.
[01:40:28.222 --> 01:40:29.003]  So I walked away.
[01:40:30.584 --> 01:40:35.246]  Well, what happened is the government came back and indicted me for the things that I'd already done.
[01:40:35.687 --> 01:40:36.287]  Went to prison.
[01:40:37.307 --> 01:40:38.488]  Did five years in prison.
[01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.669]  I got out.
[01:40:42.510 --> 01:40:45.332]  Immediately after I got out, they had Danilo Blandon started to call me.
[01:40:46.363 --> 01:40:49.544]  And his goal was to get me back inside of drugs, but I didn't want to go back.
[01:40:49.564 --> 01:40:50.904]  I was trying to go straight.
[01:40:51.624 --> 01:40:54.585]  He hounded me for like six months to introduce him to one of my friends.
[01:40:56.085 --> 01:41:09.029]  Once I made the introduction, my friend handed him a bag of money, and the cops swooped in, arrested all of us, and they got me for brokering the deal, for making the introduction, saying that I knew that they were going to be doing a drug deal.
[01:41:10.916 --> 01:41:13.418]  And for that reason that I aided and abetted the crime.
[01:41:14.518 --> 01:41:16.420]  For doing that crime, they gave me a life sentence.
[01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:24.205]  While I was sitting in jail doing this life sentence, fighting my case, I was approached by a reporter, Gary Webb.
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:26.661]  Well, Gary came down and he saw me.
[01:41:26.681 --> 01:41:30.463]  He started talking about that I was in something bigger than, you know, what I thought I was.
[01:41:30.783 --> 01:41:34.025]  But you know also too, Alex, that there were some cops on my case.
[01:41:34.045 --> 01:41:36.286]  They called themselves the Freeway Task Force.
[01:41:36.946 --> 01:41:42.389]  And those cops were robbing and stealing and, you know, they let the dog bite me while I was handcuffed.
[01:41:43.469 --> 01:41:44.530]  They got indicted as well.
[01:41:46.201 --> 01:41:50.607]  So, I meet Gary Webb and he's like, oh man, this is bigger than what you think it is.
[01:41:50.647 --> 01:41:58.899]  I'm thinking that they're talking about the crooked cops, you know, it's like 35, 40 cops that's running around robbing drug dealers, taking their money, and they became drug dealers themselves.
[01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:01.603]  Really, because they was taking the drugs from one person.
[01:42:02.495 --> 01:42:07.719]  Planting them on another person and selling them to this person and just you know just criminal enterprise.
[01:42:08.259 --> 01:42:23.751]  I mean the whole the whole war on drugs is just like one big hopes of one person benefiting this one another one benefiting that way but at the end of the day guys like myself get caught in the middle and and I believe that we're the ones who's paying the biggest price.
[01:42:24.131 --> 01:42:25.652]  Not necessarily myself because
[01:42:27.574 --> 01:42:29.756]  When I was in prison, I couldn't cry about my time.
[01:42:30.336 --> 01:42:36.301]  You know, if they'd have gave me the life sentence so I'd have had to do the rest of my life in prison, I could have accepted that because...
[01:42:38.291 --> 01:42:39.531]  I knew what I was doing.
[01:42:39.892 --> 01:42:44.193]  You know, I knew I was selling drugs, and I knew that I shouldn't have been selling drugs after a period of time.
[01:42:44.733 --> 01:42:51.235]  You know, that's the key to integrity and sanity, I've learned, is admitting when you've been wrong, admitting and owning up to it.
[01:42:51.836 --> 01:42:56.697]  But then there's the giant hypocrisy, they're the ones bringing the drugs in, and they're the ones putting you in jail.
[01:42:56.917 --> 01:43:00.479]  That's a thousand times worse, and they never own up to any of it.
[01:43:00.759 --> 01:43:03.840]  In fact, they sit up there like they're God, and they're clean, and they're good.
[01:43:03.860 --> 01:43:05.220]  That makes you want to throw up.
[01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:06.901]  Well, you know, that's what really, really
[01:43:07.862 --> 01:43:10.668]  It started to affect me, you know, when I was in prison and I'm like...
[01:43:11.667 --> 01:43:16.830]  Once everything came out and I interviewed with the CIA, you know the CIA came down to my jail cell.
[01:43:16.930 --> 01:43:20.972]  Let's talk about that, but let's also go back to your trial when you learn about all this with Gary Webb.
[01:43:21.272 --> 01:43:25.834]  Tell that story, because Webb talked about how he got threatened out in the hall, threatened to kill him and stuff.
[01:43:26.095 --> 01:43:27.355]  They didn't just threaten to kill his kids.
[01:43:27.936 --> 01:43:33.238]  I mean, the feds themselves that were there, not just the CIA, they were basically all in on it.
[01:43:33.338 --> 01:43:36.200]  The VA, I mean, they sent back this new trial.
[01:43:36.420 --> 01:43:37.320]  We're going to trial.
[01:43:40.083 --> 01:43:45.850]  We have a, there's a period in court where you get to interview the informant because we never talk to the informant.
[01:43:45.870 --> 01:43:47.251]  We don't know what the informant is going to say.
[01:43:47.792 --> 01:43:50.995]  You have no clue about what the person who's going to testify against you going to say.
[01:43:51.636 --> 01:43:55.540]  So the court has a thing where they call a pre-trial hearing.
[01:43:56.277 --> 01:43:59.541]  Where the informant is supposed to come to like a little room.
[01:44:00.022 --> 01:44:02.965]  I couldn't be there but my lawyer was supposed to be there and Gary was supposed to be there.
[01:44:03.506 --> 01:44:12.737]  Well anyway, Blandon comes to this hearing, and when they get in the room and my lawyer wants to ask him some questions, and the guy said, everything that I gotta say I'm gonna say during trial.
[01:44:12.777 --> 01:44:14.740]  So we don't know what this guy is gonna say.
[01:44:16.437 --> 01:44:17.878]  You're unable to ever do a deposition?
[01:44:18.258 --> 01:44:19.519]  No deposition with this guy.
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:24.124]  So, when we get to trial, my lawyer don't have a clue what's going on.
[01:44:24.384 --> 01:44:27.086]  All the information that Gary has, we don't have this information.
[01:44:27.587 --> 01:44:28.788]  And Gary's not giving it to us.
[01:44:29.369 --> 01:44:30.850]  He didn't give us this information at first.
[01:44:31.230 --> 01:44:34.594]  Because Gary knew I had the relationship with LA Times.
[01:44:35.515 --> 01:44:45.341]  So I felt that Gary was worried about me leaking his information to Jesse Katz at LA Times, because you know me and Jesse Katz still had a relationship where we talked once in a while.
[01:44:45.401 --> 01:44:46.542]  So Gary didn't give it to us.
[01:44:47.102 --> 01:44:53.106]  We start trial, and in the middle of trial, my lawyer keeps running back and forth to Gary.
[01:44:53.807 --> 01:44:54.707]  Gary's in the audience.
[01:44:55.468 --> 01:44:56.769]  So he's at the trial.
[01:45:01.202 --> 01:45:06.903]  That was smart.
[01:45:06.923 --> 01:45:12.124]  That way the LA Times, now admitted, run by the CIA, the editor of CIA, trying to cover all this up.
[01:45:12.144 --> 01:45:12.884]  You didn't know that.
[01:45:13.384 --> 01:45:18.025]  He could only ask it while it was happening live, so he would get the intel, and they couldn't spin it.
[01:45:18.405 --> 01:45:18.865]  Exactly.
[01:45:19.066 --> 01:45:21.066]  I mean, he had to do it like that almost.
[01:45:21.626 --> 01:45:25.207]  Because I may have given it to Jesse, not knowing
[01:45:26.167 --> 01:45:27.828]  You know, because I didn't know the scope of this.
[01:45:27.848 --> 01:45:29.469]  Believe me, I had no idea.
[01:45:29.509 --> 01:45:32.832]  You know, they tried to say that I told Gary how to put it together.
[01:45:33.712 --> 01:45:34.673]  You know they said that, right?
[01:45:34.693 --> 01:45:34.933]  Yes.
[01:45:35.233 --> 01:45:35.553]  They did.
[01:45:35.654 --> 01:45:40.077]  Oh, Rick Ross dreamed this all up and put this together and fed it to Gary and got Gary to buy into it.
[01:45:40.097 --> 01:45:41.217]  But I didn't know none of this.
[01:45:41.578 --> 01:45:44.039]  They gave me more credit than I deserve.
[01:45:44.059 --> 01:45:46.481]  Who would have thought the LA Times, you know, was involved, yeah.
[01:45:48.459 --> 01:45:49.179]  That's how it works, though.
[01:45:49.199 --> 01:45:52.821]  You're going to take down a culture and bring in and make trillions off drugs.
[01:45:52.861 --> 01:45:53.962]  You've got to run the newspapers.
[01:45:54.142 --> 01:45:54.802]  Yeah, you have to.
[01:45:54.942 --> 01:45:55.383]  You have to.
[01:45:55.663 --> 01:45:56.743]  And that's what's so amazing.
[01:45:56.783 --> 01:46:00.385]  Even right now, today, you know, it baffles me that people don't know this.
[01:46:01.046 --> 01:46:02.727]  I'm like, the CIA admitted it.
[01:46:02.747 --> 01:46:03.827]  They got a report.
[01:46:03.867 --> 01:46:07.409]  You can go to their website and the report is on their website and people don't know it.
[01:46:07.469 --> 01:46:09.630]  Father Inspector General, please continue.
[01:46:11.363 --> 01:46:18.068]  We're in court, and Gary's asking Mallory this, and then the judge recognized what's going on, and she was like, well, why do you keep talking to this reporter?
[01:46:18.629 --> 01:46:21.071]  Why are you running back and forth to him in the courtroom?
[01:46:21.831 --> 01:46:23.553]  I want you to stand here and do this.
[01:46:23.873 --> 01:46:36.583]  We're not on a fishing exposition, because, you know, Gary was asking about certain names, Enrique Ramirez, and then Blandon talks about, well, my boss goes on a fishing trip with George Bush, and when they come back, they say the ends justify the means.
[01:46:39.187 --> 01:46:41.128]  All this type of stuff, but this stuff is still not making sense.
[01:46:41.148 --> 01:46:42.349]  It's all Machiavelli, yeah.
[01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:43.989]  To me, it doesn't make any sense.
[01:46:44.009 --> 01:46:44.590]  You know, I don't know.
[01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:48.932]  I mean, I'm learning about the court system while I'm there, but, you know, I'm not a lawyer.
[01:46:49.492 --> 01:46:52.753]  I'm still a novice.
[01:46:52.773 --> 01:46:54.274]  You know, this is a guy that couldn't read.
[01:46:54.814 --> 01:46:57.015]  You know, two years ago, I couldn't read.
[01:46:57.115 --> 01:47:00.317]  So, I'm still learning what's going on.
[01:47:00.897 --> 01:47:02.438]  So then, eventually, we finish trial.
[01:47:02.498 --> 01:47:03.538]  They give me the life sentence.
[01:47:05.563 --> 01:47:07.486]  Couple months later, Gary's story come out.
[01:47:08.186 --> 01:47:09.268]  Gary sends me a copy.
[01:47:09.288 --> 01:47:11.230]  I get a copy the day before it comes out.
[01:47:12.051 --> 01:47:17.659]  I call Gary on the phone and then we start to talk and he starts to tell me, you know, about the CIA being involved, about the Contras.
[01:47:17.879 --> 01:47:19.601]  Because, you know, I really didn't know what the Contras was.
[01:47:20.698 --> 01:47:22.260]  I had no clue what the conscience was.
[01:47:22.340 --> 01:47:28.366]  Definitely did not know that they were backed by the CIA and Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
[01:47:28.406 --> 01:47:29.868]  Had no clue that they was backed by that.
[01:47:30.549 --> 01:47:35.013]  I did know that Danilo and these guys and all of his friends were fighting a war in their country.
[01:47:36.054 --> 01:47:37.975]  Uh, didn't know what the war was over.
[01:47:37.995 --> 01:47:41.116]  I mean, you're talking about a guy that's illiterate still.
[01:47:41.676 --> 01:47:42.416]  I'm still illiterate.
[01:47:42.756 --> 01:47:43.557]  Had never read a book.
[01:47:43.577 --> 01:47:44.637]  Well, this stuff's complex.
[01:47:44.677 --> 01:47:45.557]  You're busy anyways.
[01:47:45.577 --> 01:47:47.798]  It's come out Ronald Reagan, not defending him.
[01:47:48.078 --> 01:47:48.618]  He didn't know.
[01:47:48.658 --> 01:47:51.760]  It was George Herbert Walker Bush running all that as well, keeping it from him.
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:54.841]  So if the president didn't know, Rick, you can't blame me for not knowing.
[01:47:55.061 --> 01:47:58.402]  Yeah, so I'm still a novice to all the stuff that's going on.
[01:47:59.321 --> 01:48:03.562]  But when it comes out, Gary runs it down to him and he starts to tell me, and I'm like, I just got Gary.
[01:48:04.022 --> 01:48:04.762]  He's out there.
[01:48:06.342 --> 01:48:17.164]  So, the next thing I know, a couple days later, the OIG is at my cell, the CIA is at my cell, Congresswoman Maxine Waters is there.
[01:48:17.184 --> 01:48:19.705]  I mean, it just starts to pour.
[01:48:19.745 --> 01:48:21.065]  All these people are coming and coming.
[01:48:21.105 --> 01:48:22.845]  I'm like, what is going on?
[01:48:22.865 --> 01:48:23.566]  Let's talk about that.
[01:48:23.586 --> 01:48:25.666]  What did the CIA say to you when they came to your cell?
[01:48:26.516 --> 01:48:37.481]  Well, they started to talk to me about how much drugs I sold, who did I get my drugs from, did I have a contract with the CIA, and I was like, no, I ain't never been with the CIA, I don't know nothing about the CIA.
[01:48:37.501 --> 01:48:42.302]  They know you were compartmentalized, they wanted to act like, well, he refutes the story.
[01:48:42.843 --> 01:48:44.964]  Kind of, yeah, that's what they pretty much said.
[01:48:46.602 --> 01:48:48.563]  Uh, did I get drugs from Danilo Blandon?
[01:48:48.603 --> 01:48:50.204]  How long had I been getting drugs from him?
[01:48:50.844 --> 01:48:51.745]  Uh, that kind of stuff.
[01:48:51.785 --> 01:48:53.645]  And I was like, well, you guys want me to talk to you.
[01:48:54.206 --> 01:48:56.127]  Uh, why you don't straighten my court sentence out?
[01:48:56.147 --> 01:48:57.207]  You know, I got a life sentence.
[01:48:57.907 --> 01:48:59.408]  Uh, will you straighten my court sentence out?
[01:48:59.508 --> 01:49:00.949]  No, we don't have anything to do with that.
[01:49:00.969 --> 01:49:02.290]  We're not going to help you with your courts.
[01:49:02.830 --> 01:49:06.131]  Uh, if you want to talk to us, you just talk to us and this is how we're going to do it.
[01:49:06.472 --> 01:49:06.952]  So, uh.
[01:49:08.237 --> 01:49:09.177]  That was pretty much their definition.
[01:49:09.197 --> 01:49:11.918]  By the way, they could have snapped their fingers and got you out in a few years.
[01:49:12.519 --> 01:49:13.579]  Yeah, yeah, I already know.
[01:49:13.979 --> 01:49:24.663]  But, you know, I was incorporating with what they wanted me to do, so... Well, that's why you're, you know, a hero overall, because more and more you had a chance once it came out that it had been going on to throw Gary Webb under the bus.
[01:49:24.703 --> 01:49:25.203]  You wouldn't do it.
[01:49:25.583 --> 01:49:26.383]  Oh, no, no.
[01:49:26.644 --> 01:49:30.825]  I respect what Gary does, what he did, and even... Well, you're right.
[01:49:30.845 --> 01:49:31.745]  He's still alive.
[01:49:31.865 --> 01:49:33.566]  I mean, he's living on through his... yeah.
[01:49:33.846 --> 01:49:34.426]  Through a story?
[01:49:34.627 --> 01:49:45.074]  Absolutely, you know, and people, you know, they're always picking here and there about every little thing, you know, like, even with the movie, you know, what you didn't like about the movie?
[01:49:45.114 --> 01:49:46.255]  How did you like this?
[01:49:46.395 --> 01:49:51.058]  And, you know, it's like, hey, it's the spirit that people have to respect.
[01:49:51.118 --> 01:49:53.380]  I mean, this guy stood up for justice.
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:58.203]  He felt that even though I was selling drugs, that I still had rights that had to be
[01:49:59.964 --> 01:50:06.749]  Respected and that we should be treated... You shouldn't be in jail when the CIA sold you the drugs!
[01:50:07.249 --> 01:50:10.652]  I've had the pilot on that was flying in to the military base!
[01:50:12.082 --> 01:50:12.402]  Yeah.
[01:50:12.422 --> 01:50:13.803]  That they were then delivering to you every week.
[01:50:14.423 --> 01:50:19.725]  Yeah, and, and, and, well, I don't, I don't, I didn't feel that way about myself, but I feel that way about guys right now in prison.
[01:50:20.066 --> 01:50:31.150]  Because right now, we have guys in prison, that's been in prison 25 and 30 years, never shot anybody, never carried a gun, all he did was sold a lot of drugs, and got a lot of time, and he's still there right now today.
[01:50:31.691 --> 01:50:36.273]  Yeah, for those that don't know, the guns are down at the street level, where dealers might get robbed or something.
[01:50:36.653 --> 01:50:39.614]  Up at the top, other than bodyguards, I mean, were there ever guns?
[01:50:39.974 --> 01:50:41.415]  No, no, you didn't really need guns.
[01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:49.383]  The only time I would carry a gun if I went to a club or something like that and I think somebody might be gonna kidnap me or try to do something to me.
[01:50:49.403 --> 01:50:50.464]  It was only self-defense.
[01:50:51.704 --> 01:50:56.107]  Never... I mean, if you got more money than you can ever spend, what are you gonna do with a gun?
[01:50:56.147 --> 01:50:58.588]  You know, guys who carry guns robbing people.
[01:50:59.248 --> 01:51:00.069]  That's because they're broke.
[01:51:00.089 --> 01:51:02.670]  When you got plenty of money, the only way you want a gun is to protect your money.
[01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:03.750]  That's right.
[01:51:04.591 --> 01:51:08.313]  That's what good guns are for, is protecting your family and your money.
[01:51:09.301 --> 01:51:12.944]  I got my mind on my family, and I got my hand on my gun.
[01:51:13.504 --> 01:51:15.865]  We'll be right back with Freeway Ricky Ross.
[01:51:16.306 --> 01:51:17.447]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.

[01:51:50.715 --> 01:51:51.455]  Hey, Boomer!
[01:51:51.695 --> 01:51:55.037]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[01:51:55.137 --> 01:51:56.719]  Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[01:51:56.819 --> 01:51:58.560]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:04.264]  Mom says it's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[01:52:04.624 --> 01:52:05.364]  I know, right?
[01:52:05.444 --> 01:52:06.385]  You love it, too!
[01:52:06.765 --> 01:52:08.066]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[01:52:08.206 --> 01:52:09.087]  Let's go get some!
[01:52:09.227 --> 01:52:10.908]  Get Berkey clean water by calling 877-886-3653.
[01:52:10.968 --> 01:52:11.148]  That's 877-886-3653.
[01:52:11.188 --> 01:52:11.809]  Or visit GoBerkey.com.
[01:52:19.674 --> 01:52:23.676]  On the eve of Thanksgiving this year, I was thinking, what am I really thankful for?
[01:52:23.696 --> 01:52:31.821]  And I gotta tell you, it's my family, it's all the blessings of liberty that our forebearers secured, and it's you, the listeners of the broadcast, who've made everything we do possible.
[01:52:31.961 --> 01:52:39.905]  This Black Friday, I decided to bring you the biggest special we've ever offered on any of the Nutraceuticals at Infowarslife.com.
[01:52:40.345 --> 01:52:44.128]  I'm talking about Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver that we've been sold out of for months.
[01:52:44.368 --> 01:52:46.269]  This time I doubled down and got even more.
[01:52:46.549 --> 01:52:50.072]  As of me taping this on the eve of Thanksgiving, we have already sold half of it.
[01:52:50.132 --> 01:52:57.276]  So instead of keeping the price at its regular discounted price, we are going to give you 20% off and free shipping on single bottles.
[01:52:57.457 --> 01:53:00.859]  But if you get four bottles, we're gonna give you the fifth one free and the free shipping.
[01:53:00.979 --> 01:53:05.582]  I don't know how long this special will run, but if supplies last, we will extend it out until Cyber Monday.
[01:53:05.682 --> 01:53:08.504]  You'll find powerful nutraceuticals like Silver Bullet and other
[01:53:08.524 --> 01:53:11.405]  We all have our own idea about what being safe and secure means.
[01:53:11.425 --> 01:53:15.367]  The doors lock, bills are paid, you've got a job that keeps the lights on, and a home to call your own.
[01:53:15.767 --> 01:53:17.968]  But what happens when Mother Nature throws a curveball?
[01:53:33.951 --> 01:53:37.857]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time?
[01:53:38.217 --> 01:53:39.739]  Do you even have a plan B?
[01:53:40.340 --> 01:53:43.344]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[01:53:43.625 --> 01:53:46.208]  Children left with no homes and no one's coming to help them.
[01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:49.633]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster is
[01:53:50.734 --> 01:53:59.801]  There you'll find the absolute best prices on storable foods, non-GMO seeds, emergency water filtration devices, and so much more.
[01:54:00.001 --> 01:54:04.144]  All orders over $49 qualify for free shipping in the lower 48 states.
[01:54:04.284 --> 01:54:05.885]  Call 866-229-0927.
[01:54:06.366 --> 01:54:08.507]  That's 866-229-0927.
[01:54:08.627 --> 01:54:12.010]  And speak to one of our preparedness advisors today.
[01:54:12.270 --> 01:54:14.992]  Or visit us at mypatriotsupply.com.
[01:54:15.112 --> 01:54:18.375]  Remember, before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.
[01:54:24.326 --> 01:54:26.187]  But it wasn't because I didn't know anything.
[01:54:26.227 --> 01:54:27.208]  I knew too much.
[01:54:52.012 --> 01:54:54.093]  Does that make me crazy?
[01:54:54.954 --> 01:54:55.234]  Does it?
[01:54:55.494 --> 01:54:58.196]  Does that make Gary Webb crazy?
[01:55:00.017 --> 01:55:01.157]  I think it does make me crazy.
[01:55:01.177 --> 01:55:03.799]  Because if you're in a land of nuts, that makes you crazy.
[01:55:03.839 --> 01:55:05.860]  You don't go along with them.
[01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:07.001]  Reuters reports U.S.
[01:55:07.061 --> 01:55:10.543]  states pot legalization not in line with international law.
[01:55:10.723 --> 01:55:11.003]  U.N.
[01:55:11.063 --> 01:55:13.404]  says we can't decriminalize marijuana.
[01:55:13.744 --> 01:55:15.265]  See how we're going under global government?
[01:55:15.645 --> 01:55:19.488]  Obama says he'll put carbon taxes in on us, even if Congress doesn't agree.
[01:55:20.248 --> 01:55:21.168]  Said that in China.
[01:55:21.268 --> 01:55:24.469]  See how we're living under these foreign banks' control.
[01:55:24.869 --> 01:55:26.650]  Parties come and go, but this continues.
[01:55:27.010 --> 01:55:27.370]  Look at this.
[01:55:27.390 --> 01:55:28.590]  This came out a few months ago.
[01:55:28.710 --> 01:55:32.312]  CIA admits destroying Gary Webb's career with the country's largest newspapers.
[01:55:32.552 --> 01:55:34.472]  We're going to talk about that next hour with our guest.
[01:55:35.052 --> 01:55:36.833]  We're going to get into a whole bunch of important news.
[01:55:37.233 --> 01:55:39.354]  Here's the latest story at Infowars.com.
[01:55:39.714 --> 01:55:45.515]  Russia announces deployment of bombers over the Gulf of Mexico as a new Cold War kicks off.
[01:55:45.915 --> 01:55:46.376]  Survey.
[01:55:46.456 --> 01:55:47.136]  Americans have
[01:55:47.956 --> 01:55:51.299]  Smartened up to mass government spying and are totally against the NSA.
[01:55:51.659 --> 01:55:55.543]  DC school strips Christmas from calendar after Muslims complain.
[01:55:56.003 --> 01:55:58.725]  China jails CIA's Imams.
[01:55:59.642 --> 01:56:04.928]  And we have a second video emerging of the Obamacare architect calling American people stupid and admitting it's a rip-off.
[01:56:05.529 --> 01:56:10.215]  Continuing in the UN, causing all sorts of sterilization.
[01:56:10.235 --> 01:56:11.196]  They've been caught doing that.
[01:56:11.216 --> 01:56:16.082]  That's just some of the news up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:56:16.542 --> 01:56:18.484]  Frederick E. Ross is our guest.
[01:56:19.065 --> 01:56:23.026]  He, of course, is played by a fictional, well, not a fictional character.
[01:56:23.326 --> 01:56:27.908]  He's played by an actor in an account of the real-life events that happened.
[01:56:27.928 --> 01:56:29.068]  It's almost like a documentary.
[01:56:29.088 --> 01:56:33.310]  Ian Kyl, the messenger, the hit movie out about the late Gary Webb.
[01:56:33.670 --> 01:56:42.013]  I want to hit this right now before we talk about what the CIA said to you, about your message to young people, about where you see the country and the world going.
[01:56:42.033 --> 01:56:46.154]  I don't want to open the phones up because they'll ask a lot of questions that I didn't think to ask.
[01:56:46.474 --> 01:56:47.615]  We're also going to send out a
[01:56:48.895 --> 01:56:57.237]  Twitter hashtag, so folks can respond, just whatever they want to come up with, to ask questions of Rick Ross, who's in studio with us.
[01:56:57.837 --> 01:57:02.879]  But in the few minutes we have before break, Rick, we've talked a lot about this.
[01:57:03.259 --> 01:57:04.539]  He was coming out with a new book.
[01:57:04.899 --> 01:57:05.979]  He was talking to me.
[01:57:06.479 --> 01:57:08.620]  He wasn't ready to come back on until his new book came out.
[01:57:08.660 --> 01:57:12.021]  He wanted me to put an online bibliography up of a bunch of documents.
[01:57:14.161 --> 01:57:15.421]  He was talking to a bunch of other people.
[01:57:15.721 --> 01:57:16.622]  He was talking to you.
[01:57:16.982 --> 01:57:19.103]  I talked to you right after they killed him.
[01:57:19.503 --> 01:57:22.204]  Or he committed suicide, as they say, in jail.
[01:57:22.264 --> 01:57:22.905]  You didn't buy it.
[01:57:23.605 --> 01:57:25.186]  He told you they'd been breaking into his house.
[01:57:25.226 --> 01:57:25.946]  He'd had to move.
[01:57:26.446 --> 01:57:27.167]  They'd threatened him.
[01:57:27.907 --> 01:57:31.849]  I like how the movie basically implies they killed him, but it ends before they kill him.
[01:57:32.229 --> 01:57:34.090]  This story of him shooting himself twice in the head.
[01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:37.531]  What did Gary Webb talk to you before he died?
[01:57:37.551 --> 01:57:40.412]  I mean, he talked to me about how he was very excited.
[01:57:40.652 --> 01:57:42.353]  He had all the proof to back up what he said.
[01:57:42.653 --> 01:57:44.213]  Yeah, he told me he was going to keep going.
[01:57:44.574 --> 01:57:49.055]  That he was going to get to the bottom of it and that he wasn't going to stop until he was done with it.
[01:57:49.255 --> 01:57:54.497]  And he did tell me about a new book that he was working on and he asked me if I would be a part of that as well.
[01:57:54.958 --> 01:58:00.480]  So, I mean, you know, I was talking to Kevin Booth when Kevin Booth is the one that told me about what happened.
[01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:02.883]  To Gary and I was like, what?
[01:58:03.164 --> 01:58:03.905]  I couldn't believe it.
[01:58:04.005 --> 01:58:06.089]  And right after when I spoke to you, you know,
[01:58:07.566 --> 01:58:11.449]  And that's when you asked me, you know, on air, was I thinking about committing suicide.
[01:58:11.469 --> 01:58:13.370]  And I was like, no, where did that come from?
[01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:17.293]  And I didn't really understand what you was doing until after I went back to myself and I thought about it.
[01:58:17.693 --> 01:58:26.199]  What you were doing was making sure that everybody knew that I was thinking right, that I wasn't planning on killing myself and that I was stable and whatnot.
[01:58:26.239 --> 01:58:28.220]  Yeah, I'm never going to commit suicide.
[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:29.541]  You're never going to commit suicide.
[01:58:29.821 --> 01:58:30.722]  No, no, never.
[01:58:31.322 --> 01:58:33.744]  So if you get shot twice in the head, you didn't do it.
[01:58:33.864 --> 01:58:35.125]  I love my, absolutely.
[01:58:35.165 --> 01:58:36.386]  If I get shot once in the head.
[01:58:37.625 --> 01:58:38.785]  Gary Webb, you think they killed him?
[01:58:39.886 --> 01:58:41.446]  Uh, I mean, it looks like it to me.
[01:58:41.526 --> 01:58:48.609]  I mean, just, just... I'm not a forensic or anything like that, so I really can't say if it's possible that somebody could shoot themselves in the head twice.
[01:58:49.289 --> 01:58:56.432]  Uh, but it just seems odd to me that a person could take a gun and... Because I shot a gun before, and you shoot it in a gun just like this here.
[01:58:57.112 --> 01:59:06.896]  So, and you take... Stay there, we'll talk more about it back... This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:59:11.278 --> 01:59:12.358]  In the near future.
[01:59:12.618 --> 01:59:16.779]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:59:17.119 --> 01:59:18.139]  Security alert.
[01:59:18.339 --> 01:59:20.100]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:59:20.360 --> 01:59:20.980]  Analysis.
[01:59:21.240 --> 01:59:21.900]  InfoWars.
[01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:24.040]  Building independent media operations.
[01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:28.901]  Let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:59:28.941 --> 01:59:29.861]  Prime Directive.
[01:59:29.981 --> 01:59:31.402]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:59:31.522 --> 01:59:34.302]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:59:34.362 --> 01:59:37.443]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:59:37.623 --> 01:59:39.783]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:59:39.923 --> 01:59:41.424]  These people are assaulting us!
[01:59:41.444 --> 01:59:43.686]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:59:44.286 --> 01:59:45.947]  They are never going to stop.
[01:59:46.227 --> 01:59:50.110]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:59:50.270 --> 01:59:53.453]  Block free iPhone ads at InfoWars.com.
[01:59:53.873 --> 01:59:56.495]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[01:59:57.215 --> 01:59:57.976]  Imperative.
[01:59:58.216 --> 02:00:00.217]  Destroy for the planet TV.
[02:00:00.257 --> 02:00:04.661]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:00:04.801 --> 02:00:07.062]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it!
[02:00:12.727 --> 02:00:15.357]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:26.397 --> 02:00:27.037]  Big Brother.
[02:00:27.698 --> 02:00:28.718]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:29.458 --> 02:00:30.559]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:31.239 --> 02:00:32.039]  You want answers?
[02:00:32.820 --> 02:00:33.740]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:37.962]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:38.542 --> 02:00:42.604]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:52.995 --> 02:00:55.356]  I tell you, you ought to hear what we're discussing during the breaks.
[02:00:55.476 --> 02:00:58.797]  Rick Ross on the ground floor of the CIA crack cocaine epidemic.
[02:01:00.118 --> 02:01:02.258]  He wants to get into hip-hop and how it's a weapon.
[02:01:02.939 --> 02:01:05.940]  And of course, a lot of insiders like Professor Griff and others have documented that.
[02:01:05.980 --> 02:01:08.781]  I've talked to famous people, but I can't say their names.
[02:01:09.021 --> 02:01:15.103]  Multiple major rock and roll stars who were in the meetings at MTV where they said, sorry, rock and roll's gone.
[02:01:15.563 --> 02:01:18.524]  We're bringing in the hip-hop, gangster rap, and we're weaponizing it.
[02:01:18.804 --> 02:01:20.065]  That's the word from the chiefs.
[02:01:20.959 --> 02:01:23.401]  And boy, they've done a job, so that's coming up in the next segment.
[02:01:23.701 --> 02:01:30.007]  Getting back to Gary Webb, when you went to the premiere, hung out with Renner, who also helped finance it, did a great job.
[02:01:30.407 --> 02:01:31.829]  Knowing the story as good as I do...
[02:01:32.992 --> 02:01:35.714]  I was really freaked out because it was so accurate.
[02:01:35.754 --> 02:01:37.935]  Obviously, they couldn't show everything, but it was so accurate.
[02:01:37.975 --> 02:01:39.616]  They really, I think, captured his spirit.
[02:01:40.097 --> 02:01:41.378]  I really admire Renner now.
[02:01:41.638 --> 02:01:42.078]  I do, too.
[02:01:42.158 --> 02:01:42.678]  I do, too.
[02:01:42.699 --> 02:01:48.242]  And I met Renner at the screening, me, him, and Michael, and the director, and the head producer.
[02:01:48.262 --> 02:01:50.484]  We all took photos and whatnot, and it was just like...
[02:01:52.225 --> 02:01:53.986]  Almost like Gary was there, you know what I'm saying?
[02:01:54.026 --> 02:01:55.627]  Gary's wife was there, his kids were there.
[02:01:56.027 --> 02:02:01.910]  So for me, it was an opportunity to meet people that I had never met before, but I spoke on the phone.
[02:02:02.610 --> 02:02:12.396]  And to meet his wife and his kids and just the whole environment was like, man, everything that Gary was doing was still alive, you know, to know that he hadn't died.
[02:02:12.416 --> 02:02:20.280]  I wonder how his so-called friends at the newspaper that turned their back on him, I wonder how they feel now being so famous in this film.
[02:02:21.089 --> 02:02:26.272]  Well, yeah, you know, I spoke to Jesse Katz about his role, you know, inside the film.
[02:02:26.332 --> 02:02:33.557]  And, you know, we have Jesse inside of our documentary where he apologizes for basically being a hired gun.
[02:02:34.878 --> 02:02:41.802]  And gunning Gary down, he was saying that that's one of the lowest points that he filled in his journalism, that he did that.
[02:02:42.102 --> 02:02:44.464]  Now, it was the editor of the LA Times that was CIA.
[02:02:45.958 --> 02:02:54.021]  It may have been, but he hired Jesse to... No, no, I understand, but it actually comes out in the film, because they're saying, well, the LA Times says this, and he goes, well yeah, but he's CIA.
[02:02:55.522 --> 02:02:57.422]  And of course, he was never discredited.
[02:02:57.442 --> 02:03:00.944]  That's why they had to kill him, because they tried to kill...
[02:03:01.829 --> 02:03:04.711]  Kim and the media, and then that didn't work, so they just killed him.
[02:03:04.731 --> 02:03:06.332]  Well, you know, the internet saved the story.
[02:03:06.932 --> 02:03:11.535]  I mean, if it wasn't for the internet, the story would have been dead, you know, from the start.
[02:03:11.795 --> 02:03:18.099]  But the thing about it was so good is that it was the first time a major newspaper had ever released a story on the internet.
[02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:24.504]  Once it hit that internet, you know, it just started going from person to person to person to person.
[02:03:24.985 --> 02:03:29.629]  And, uh, you know, another thing, it was the first time that blacks had ever really came out on the internet the way they did.
[02:03:29.649 --> 02:03:37.297]  They really came out and, uh... Oh, let's talk about that when we come back, and then we'll get into, um, the hip-hop and your message to the young people, but...
[02:03:38.058 --> 02:03:42.623]  We ought to find those clips like where Mike Rupert confronts the CIA Director or Maxine Waters does.
[02:03:43.103 --> 02:03:46.467]  You can find it online, like Mike Rupert confronts CIA Director Maxine Waters does.
[02:03:47.047 --> 02:03:49.349]  And Deutch just shuts down and then had to quit after that.
[02:03:49.369 --> 02:03:50.511]  I mean, people were mad.
[02:03:50.531 --> 02:03:51.852]  They're like, you put this on our streets?
[02:03:51.892 --> 02:03:52.713]  That was powerful.
[02:03:53.013 --> 02:03:53.574]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:03:53.794 --> 02:03:55.656]  When he came down to South Central at Locke High School.
[02:03:57.742 --> 02:03:58.483]  I want to get your take.
[02:03:58.503 --> 02:03:59.523]  We'll start talking about that.
[02:04:29.403 --> 02:04:30.724]  And these people wanted the answers.
[02:04:30.744 --> 02:04:32.845]  They want to know why were the kids taken away so long.
[02:04:32.865 --> 02:04:40.009]  You know, I have about 11 friends that's been in prison right now 26 years from selling drugs.
[02:04:40.029 --> 02:04:41.430]  20, maybe even 30 some of them.
[02:04:41.490 --> 02:04:43.231]  So people want answers.
[02:04:43.792 --> 02:04:48.094]  And Dutch felt that it would be better to address it than to let it keep simmering.
[02:04:48.154 --> 02:04:54.038]  And a big mistake he made, you know, by coming to South Central and confronting those people because they really gave it to him.
[02:04:55.060 --> 02:04:59.122]  We're going to play the clips of Mike Rupert and others.
[02:05:00.122 --> 02:05:02.303]  I guess it was Maxine Waters visiting you in your cell.
[02:05:02.323 --> 02:05:04.084]  Who was the congresswoman that was there at that time?
[02:05:04.124 --> 02:05:04.704]  Juanita McDowell.
[02:05:04.764 --> 02:05:05.865]  Maxine Waters was there too.
[02:05:06.005 --> 02:05:06.305]  That's right.
[02:05:06.345 --> 02:05:07.365]  Okay, I'm going from memory here.
[02:05:07.405 --> 02:05:08.126]  They both was there.
[02:05:08.646 --> 02:05:09.806]  But they did find the clips.
[02:05:09.826 --> 02:05:11.027]  We'll play those when we come back.
[02:05:11.667 --> 02:05:14.308]  And we'll give the phone number out so you can have your questions and comments.
[02:05:14.388 --> 02:05:17.049]  And we'll take your Twitter questions at RealAlexJones.
[02:05:17.670 --> 02:05:18.090]  Stay with us.
[02:05:20.427 --> 02:05:23.928]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:05:24.068 --> 02:05:28.049]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:28.350 --> 02:05:29.810]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:05:30.130 --> 02:05:37.712]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.

[02:06:19.986 --> 02:06:21.207]  Another major health threat.
[02:06:21.247 --> 02:06:26.149]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:06:26.229 --> 02:06:28.850]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:06:28.890 --> 02:06:35.652]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:06:35.933 --> 02:06:38.774]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:06:38.914 --> 02:06:41.855]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:06:41.875 --> 02:06:43.856]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:06:43.896 --> 02:06:46.717]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:06:46.817 --> 02:06:52.319]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:06:52.539 --> 02:06:56.020]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:06:56.040 --> 02:06:59.061]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:06:59.141 --> 02:07:06.244]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[02:07:19.690 --> 02:07:23.973]  For months, the Infowars Life Silver Bullet colloidal silver has been completely sold out.
[02:07:24.233 --> 02:07:29.336]  Now, we have finally procured a limited supply from one of the leading manufacturers of nutraceuticals in the nation.
[02:07:29.456 --> 02:07:31.378]  But here's what's truly exciting.
[02:07:31.518 --> 02:07:41.825]  While we could simply sell the survival silver for its already discounted shelf price, we have decided to give back to you, the listeners, who make it all possible with a pre-Black Friday mega sale.
[02:07:41.925 --> 02:07:44.607]  We are launching this mega special with an unprecedented

[02:07:49.469 --> 02:07:50.350]  All supplies last.
[02:07:50.550 --> 02:07:57.453]  And to help everyone stock up for the next shortage, when you buy four bottles of Silver Bullet, you'll receive the fifth one absolutely free.
[02:07:57.673 --> 02:08:00.655]  That's on top of the 20% off savings and free shipping.
[02:08:00.755 --> 02:08:04.917]  Finally, if supplies hold, we will extend this special out to Cyber Monday.
[02:08:05.157 --> 02:08:07.821]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've never done anything like this before.
[02:08:08.102 --> 02:08:13.670]  Find this mother of all specials and others I've not yet announced yet at InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:08:13.730 --> 02:08:14.571]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:08:33.983 --> 02:08:36.964]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:08:37.544 --> 02:08:41.745]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:44.966 --> 02:08:53.788]  I am a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective, and I work South Central Los Angeles, and I will tell you, Director Deutsch, emphatically... Can you speak further into the mic, sir?
[02:08:53.808 --> 02:09:03.151]  These mics don't seem to be... I will tell you, Director Deutsch, as a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective, that the agency has dealt drugs throughout this country for a long time.
[02:09:16.138 --> 02:09:16.939]  All right.
[02:09:17.119 --> 02:09:19.801]  All right.
[02:09:21.162 --> 02:09:21.682]  All right.
[02:09:21.942 --> 02:09:24.564]  Obviously, that is an answer for a lot of you.
[02:09:24.584 --> 02:09:26.545]  Now, can you please... All right.
[02:09:26.706 --> 02:09:29.367]  Now, can you please... Wait, wait, wait.
[02:09:30.068 --> 02:09:30.748]  Wait a minute.
[02:09:32.870 --> 02:09:34.030]  Wait a minute.
[02:09:37.653 --> 02:09:40.114]  Wait a minute here.
[02:09:46.525 --> 02:09:46.986]  Wait a minute.
[02:09:47.146 --> 02:09:50.629]  If you don't like what's going on here, please leave now.
[02:09:50.649 --> 02:09:52.872]  No, no, no.
[02:09:52.972 --> 02:09:53.332]  Leave.
[02:09:53.452 --> 02:09:53.913]  No, no, no.
[02:09:54.113 --> 02:09:57.837]  Leave now because there are others who do want to hear what's going on in this room.
[02:10:00.544 --> 02:10:12.327]  Alright, you can watch an hour of that famous C-SPAN footage, and of course it made Deutsch resign a few weeks later, and then it caused an Inspector General report and they admitted it.
[02:10:12.367 --> 02:10:13.147]  It all came out.
[02:10:13.688 --> 02:10:14.368]  That's the thing.
[02:10:14.408 --> 02:10:17.629]  People say, oh, government involvement, 9-11 will come out.
[02:10:17.749 --> 02:10:18.129]  It has.
[02:10:18.609 --> 02:10:20.629]  Government involvement sterilizing people will come out.
[02:10:20.729 --> 02:10:21.109]  It has.
[02:10:21.510 --> 02:10:23.310]  Government involvement shipping drugs in will come out.
[02:10:23.450 --> 02:10:23.810]  It has.
[02:10:24.170 --> 02:10:26.651]  It came out in the 60s, on the opium.
[02:10:27.947 --> 02:10:31.329]  The heroin in Southeast Asia, it's come out in Afghanistan.
[02:10:32.150 --> 02:10:39.915]  It went from 7% of world opium production in Afghanistan to 93%, that's the UN's own report, after our liberation of it.
[02:10:39.935 --> 02:10:46.720]  I don't need to play the Fox News clips again or CNN or ABC, them admitting our troops guard and grow the opium.
[02:10:46.740 --> 02:10:49.482]  Do you understand that, folks?
[02:10:49.562 --> 02:10:54.165]  And then, if your son or daughter is dumb enough to get on heroin,
[02:10:55.390 --> 02:11:00.055]  God forbid, or unlucky enough, they're gonna throw him in jail when they shipped it in?
[02:11:01.197 --> 02:11:01.897]  That's crazy!
[02:11:03.519 --> 02:11:14.331]  That'd be like if you were a mafia don and ordered one of your guys to go rob a bank, and then the mafia don shows up in a police outfit and takes you to jail for robbing the bank when he publicly ordered him to do that.
[02:11:15.279 --> 02:11:17.220]  Freeway Ricky Ross is our guest.
[02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:21.703]  He went to sell out Gary Webb and others, so they kept him in prison a lot longer than he should have been there.
[02:11:22.384 --> 02:11:27.947]  And again, I don't glorify drug dealing, but it's the fact that it's illegal that puts all this money into it.
[02:11:27.967 --> 02:11:35.852]  You regulate it, you make it a shameful thing to do, you don't have all these Hollywood movies promoting it on purpose to prime the pump, and it will go away.
[02:11:35.992 --> 02:11:39.375]  Areas of Europe have done that, and drug abuse has gone down about 50%.
[02:11:40.075 --> 02:11:41.516]  So it's because I don't like drugs.
[02:11:41.576 --> 02:11:42.697]  Folks, I don't use drugs.
[02:11:44.499 --> 02:11:46.682]  I get prescriptions sometimes, you know, if I'm sick.
[02:11:47.643 --> 02:11:48.404]  I drink coffee.
[02:11:48.464 --> 02:11:49.085]  I drink tea.
[02:11:49.145 --> 02:11:50.607]  Occasionally I drink beer or wine.
[02:11:51.127 --> 02:11:52.008]  But, I mean, that's it.
[02:11:52.769 --> 02:11:56.914]  It's the drug dealers that are currently operating in government and big banks and then low-level ones.
[02:11:56.934 --> 02:11:59.357]  They don't want it to be made legal or decriminalized.
[02:11:59.978 --> 02:12:01.159]  Rick Ross is our guest.
[02:12:01.259 --> 02:12:03.119]  We're going to be taking your phone calls coming up.
[02:12:03.580 --> 02:12:04.840]  It's the Sunday phone number today.
[02:12:04.860 --> 02:12:06.521]  We're running the whole show out of our operation.
[02:12:06.541 --> 02:12:07.141]  877-789-ALEX.
[02:12:07.161 --> 02:12:07.201]  877-789-2539.
[02:12:07.221 --> 02:12:07.942]  Callers for Rick Ross.
[02:12:07.962 --> 02:12:08.122]  877-789-ALEX.
[02:12:08.142 --> 02:12:08.182]  877-789-2539.
[02:12:08.202 --> 02:12:11.163]  And we've got your Twitter questions coming in at hashtag Rick Ross.
[02:12:25.149 --> 02:12:31.211]  Just tweet at us with hashtag Rick Ross on the IW chats at RealAlexJones on Twitter.
[02:12:31.491 --> 02:12:33.212]  We've already got some of those questions pouring in.
[02:12:33.672 --> 02:12:50.998]  Rick, other points you want to make, and I know you want to get into hip-hop, that you say is the new crack cocaine epidemic culture war machine, and then I've got some amazing testimony I can give you on that exact fact, backing up what you have to say.
[02:12:51.238 --> 02:12:52.799]  Tell folks what you told me off-air.
[02:12:53.582 --> 02:12:59.404]  Well, I believe that what they've done is they've taken hip-hop and they've made it glorious to be a drug dealer.
[02:12:59.524 --> 02:13:01.024]  You know, when I sold drugs, I hid.
[02:13:01.044 --> 02:13:02.805]  I didn't want anybody to know I sold drugs.
[02:13:02.905 --> 02:13:07.687]  But now, they got these guys who never sold drugs, technically, you know.
[02:13:07.927 --> 02:13:11.668]  One guy was a correctional officer who goes by the name of Rick Ross now.
[02:13:11.728 --> 02:13:14.549]  He took my whole identity and the court said that he could do it.
[02:13:15.194 --> 02:13:19.316]  And he could prance around the country and say that he's me and take my whole life and use it.
[02:13:20.116 --> 02:13:21.397]  And there was nothing I could do about it.
[02:13:21.417 --> 02:13:22.097]  I can't stop him.
[02:13:22.717 --> 02:13:24.078]  He even grew a beard just like you.
[02:13:24.898 --> 02:13:25.279]  Everything.
[02:13:26.119 --> 02:13:34.843]  So, now they take these guys and these guys say, well, I got to the position that I'm in right now today by selling drugs.
[02:13:35.543 --> 02:13:43.847]  So the message that it tells our kids is that if you go out, you sell drugs, then you can become a great rock star like myself.
[02:13:45.256 --> 02:13:46.197]  And never go to prison.
[02:13:47.318 --> 02:13:52.603]  And I think that that's a false message to be giving people who feel hopeless.
[02:13:52.984 --> 02:13:55.546]  And notice they don't indict the people that are fake and claim all that.
[02:13:56.007 --> 02:14:02.934]  No, no, they want them out there like a lantern fish has that light to get the little fish to swim over so they can eat them.
[02:14:03.630 --> 02:14:04.851]  Exactly, and that's what I believe.
[02:14:04.911 --> 02:14:13.458]  I mean, if I were to go on tape and say, oh yeah, I sold 300 kilos of cocaine, and now you got me admitting that I did that, they would indict me for it.
[02:14:13.938 --> 02:14:16.721]  But the way they're doing it now, they're saying it's just art form.
[02:14:17.261 --> 02:14:18.222]  It's just a form of art.
[02:14:18.302 --> 02:14:25.227]  And I believe that it's sucking in our kids, and you know, you turn on the radio and it's just filled with it.
[02:14:25.247 --> 02:14:26.729]  What do you want to say to Rick Ross?
[02:14:26.749 --> 02:14:28.030]  Because you'll probably see this video.
[02:14:28.590 --> 02:14:29.471]  Well, fake Rick Ross.
[02:14:29.791 --> 02:14:36.535]  I would tell him that it's time to change, that it's time to tell the kids the truth.
[02:14:37.036 --> 02:14:44.061]  You know, and let them know that technically he's never sold drugs and that he didn't get his money from selling drugs.
[02:14:44.441 --> 02:14:48.924]  That Universal gave him the money to do the things that he's doing.
[02:14:48.944 --> 02:14:51.886]  That it's okay to admit that you never did that.
[02:14:52.326 --> 02:14:57.670]  And not let our kids believe that they can go out and sell drugs and never pay a penalty for doing that.
[02:15:01.104 --> 02:15:02.985]  Does it make you angry to see him doing that?
[02:15:04.545 --> 02:15:07.326]  Well, really, the whole culture.
[02:15:07.906 --> 02:15:10.427]  I mean, I'm disappointed in the whole culture.
[02:15:10.807 --> 02:15:15.389]  Really, not really him, because I don't think that he understands what he's doing.
[02:15:16.289 --> 02:15:22.911]  To him, I believe that he's making a living and he's almost like I was when I sold drugs.
[02:15:25.413 --> 02:15:29.138]  So, he don't understand the... But you were actually doing it and taking the risk.
[02:15:29.439 --> 02:15:34.786]  He's out there selling this culture and this idea where young kids are going to go out and get their lives ruined or killed.
[02:15:35.647 --> 02:15:37.289]  In my book, that's a lot worse than what you did.
[02:15:38.755 --> 02:15:40.516]  At least you had your butt hanging out there.
[02:15:40.956 --> 02:15:44.256]  Yeah, and they're getting it to maybe even more people than I did.
[02:15:44.616 --> 02:15:54.158]  I mean, you know... Well, notice though, even though these guys are fake gangsters, they're always getting shot up and killed because real gangsters come after them, or other people that think they're gangsters come after them.
[02:15:54.659 --> 02:15:55.499]  It's totally sick.
[02:15:55.879 --> 02:15:56.559]  It is, it is.
[02:15:56.759 --> 02:15:59.740]  But then, you know, you go to our schools, and guess who you hear on the radio?
[02:16:00.460 --> 02:16:04.121]  Playing in a high school gym on the turntables.
[02:16:04.601 --> 02:16:05.261]  Guess who you hear on the...
[02:16:06.101 --> 02:16:06.541]  Jay-Z.
[02:16:06.922 --> 02:16:08.903]  Well, I'm glad you're speaking to high schools and colleges.
[02:16:08.923 --> 02:16:10.724]  We need to get you to just thousands of them.
[02:16:10.985 --> 02:16:12.045]  We need to shut this down.
[02:16:12.146 --> 02:16:18.390]  Well, you know, and you say that, that it's harder for me to get in with my message than it is for them.
[02:16:18.450 --> 02:16:28.838]  They'll pay these guys $100,000 to come there and tell the kids how much drugs they sold and how glorious it is to sell drugs, and they don't even want me on campus.
[02:16:30.796 --> 02:16:34.079]  Because you're going to tell them, it's the government, it'll ruin your life, don't touch it.
[02:16:35.019 --> 02:16:37.041]  And by the way, you're going to go to prison forever if you don't.
[02:16:37.281 --> 02:16:39.423]  And it's that message that'll keep kids off drugs.
[02:16:40.324 --> 02:16:44.167]  Not the one of, oh, it's sexy and fun, and you want to get involved in this.
[02:16:44.187 --> 02:16:47.410]  This is how you really start rolling and getting all the chicks and everything.
[02:16:47.430 --> 02:16:48.370]  No, you're not going to get any of that.
[02:16:48.591 --> 02:16:50.352]  You're going to end up getting TB in a prison cell.
[02:16:50.852 --> 02:16:51.353]  Exactly.
[02:16:52.113 --> 02:16:54.796]  And get your lights cut off at 7 o'clock at night.
[02:16:57.298 --> 02:16:59.419]  Told when to get up in the morning, when to go to bed.
[02:17:00.512 --> 02:17:01.432]  And how to live your life.
[02:17:03.653 --> 02:17:04.514]  It makes me sick.
[02:17:04.534 --> 02:17:05.995]  And they're going to give you a job.
[02:17:06.715 --> 02:17:07.956]  Or you can't get a job on the street?
[02:17:08.116 --> 02:17:09.556]  Oh, well they got a job for you in prison.
[02:17:10.117 --> 02:17:10.897]  It's called Unicor.
[02:17:10.917 --> 02:17:12.798]  And you're going to make money.
[02:17:13.498 --> 02:17:14.018]  Prison money.
[02:17:14.038 --> 02:17:15.359]  25 cents an hour.
[02:17:16.439 --> 02:17:17.620]  And the job that you're going to be doing?
[02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:18.941]  Skillful job.
[02:17:18.961 --> 02:17:22.802]  Because people on the street, they get $35 an hour to do that same job.
[02:17:23.843 --> 02:17:25.484]  But we're only going to give you 25 cents.
[02:17:26.004 --> 02:17:26.764]  But that's all you need.
[02:17:27.265 --> 02:17:28.105]  Because we're going to feed you.
[02:17:29.571 --> 02:17:29.951]  How's you?
[02:17:30.732 --> 02:17:31.853]  We wash your clothes for you.
[02:17:33.495 --> 02:17:34.776]  You have nothing to worry about in here.
[02:17:35.557 --> 02:17:39.801]  And then the good old boys sit around going, I hear they got hot tubs and cable in them prisons.
[02:17:40.241 --> 02:17:41.442]  I say make them work.
[02:17:41.823 --> 02:17:48.149]  And then they wonder why their son or daughter can't get a job in a factory because the factories are all built on the side of the prisons.
[02:17:48.189 --> 02:17:48.989]  For 25 cents an hour.
[02:17:49.370 --> 02:17:49.530]  Yep.
[02:17:49.810 --> 02:17:53.614]  And then they charge you as much as 50 cent a minute for a phone call.
[02:17:56.553 --> 02:18:02.116]  So you gotta work two hours to talk to your wife or your girlfriend or your son or daughter for two minutes?
[02:18:02.656 --> 02:18:02.836]  Yep.
[02:18:04.157 --> 02:18:04.697]  Absolutely.
[02:18:05.818 --> 02:18:08.239]  And then you know visits, they only let you visit twice a week.
[02:18:11.140 --> 02:18:12.301]  It is such an evil plan.
[02:18:13.301 --> 02:18:16.303]  And then you may be like I was, you know, where your family is in L.A.
[02:18:16.363 --> 02:18:18.564]  and they got you in Texarkana, Texas.
[02:18:20.645 --> 02:18:22.286]  So you may only see your family once a year.
[02:18:22.846 --> 02:18:23.347]  If you're lucky.
[02:18:25.588 --> 02:18:26.068]  If you're lucky.
[02:18:27.574 --> 02:18:33.936]  You look like you're about to cry thinking about all those kids getting sucked in by those spiders run by Universal and all the rest of them.
[02:18:33.956 --> 02:18:37.517]  I mean, they're setting up webs to catch kids and put them in that prison.
[02:18:37.817 --> 02:18:38.337]  Absolutely.
[02:18:38.718 --> 02:18:39.198]  Absolutely.
[02:18:39.238 --> 02:18:44.559]  When you know they got what they call now, I just spoke at a conference in San Francisco.
[02:18:44.619 --> 02:18:49.201]  They call it from Head Start to the prison pipeline.
[02:18:50.281 --> 02:18:51.582]  So they say they can tell right now.
[02:18:51.602 --> 02:18:55.923]  They got people that say they can tell right now a kid that's in kindergarten if he's going to prison.
[02:18:57.383 --> 02:19:08.008]  Well, I read a report, it was in mainstream news in New Mexico about two years ago, that the biggest prison corporation in the world was financing security at the school and was there admitting they're preparing those kids to go to prison.
[02:19:08.548 --> 02:19:11.849]  That the whole thing is just an induction pipeline right into the prison.
[02:19:12.270 --> 02:19:12.910]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[02:19:13.550 --> 02:19:14.150]  I can't believe it.
[02:19:14.410 --> 02:19:18.292]  I mean, how would people stand around and go for something like this here?
[02:19:19.693 --> 02:19:20.233]  I can't do it.
[02:19:21.914 --> 02:19:25.075]  Well, there are people like Professor Griffin and others that are exposing what's happening in hip-hop.
[02:19:25.916 --> 02:19:26.456]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:19:27.609 --> 02:19:29.131]  I spoke to Professor Griffin.
[02:19:29.551 --> 02:19:30.912]  We're planning on doing some things together.
[02:19:31.292 --> 02:19:32.293]  Yeah, he's a really great guy.
[02:19:32.313 --> 02:19:36.717]  Army veteran, really smart guy, trying to expose what's happening.
[02:19:36.877 --> 02:19:39.039]  Well, you know, the record labels are not going to touch those guys, though.
[02:19:39.960 --> 02:19:41.601]  Even though they're the real pioneers of hip-hop.
[02:19:41.821 --> 02:19:43.763]  Absolutely, but he can't get a record on the radio.
[02:19:45.484 --> 02:19:46.285]  Totally underground.
[02:19:46.485 --> 02:19:50.488]  It's going to be up to us, you know, the people in the streets, like, you know, what you're doing right now.
[02:19:50.929 --> 02:19:52.990]  I mean, mainstream won't touch me.
[02:19:53.711 --> 02:19:54.612]  They won't give me an interview.
[02:19:55.376 --> 02:19:56.117]  They won't talk to me.
[02:19:56.137 --> 02:19:58.541]  A drug dealer in my studio?
[02:19:58.721 --> 02:19:59.062]  Never.
[02:20:00.944 --> 02:20:03.288]  Instead, you're the real Rick Ross saying don't use drugs.
[02:20:03.829 --> 02:20:07.755]  And they got the other Rick Ross running around making kids think it's sexy and they want him in the schools.
[02:20:10.615 --> 02:20:12.596]  That's because the spiders want to get those kids.
[02:20:13.356 --> 02:20:14.016]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:20:14.397 --> 02:20:14.777]  Stay there.
[02:20:14.797 --> 02:20:18.138]  I want to come back, get into anything else you want to cover, and take phone calls.
[02:20:18.398 --> 02:20:20.059]  And I'll tell you my story about the inside.
[02:20:20.679 --> 02:20:26.602]  If you have Candida overgrowth, just taking antifungal agents or starving yourself of sweets does not address the cause.
[02:20:26.742 --> 02:20:32.404]  Candida overgrowth is the result of a toxic, damaged, acidic, low oxygen, and inflamed tissue environment.
[02:20:32.504 --> 02:20:36.546]  The goal should be to remove the toxins, heal damaged tissues, restore healthy pH,
[02:20:36.946 --> 02:20:39.487]  Eliminate inflammation and feed beneficial bacteria.
[02:20:39.707 --> 02:20:48.752]  Previous usage of antibiotics or steroids or exposure to mercury or other toxins can damage many cells in the GI tract and body that make you prone to Candida overgrowth.
[02:20:48.932 --> 02:20:51.693]  Removing toxins and healing tissues should be the goal.
[02:20:51.953 --> 02:21:01.258]  One World Whey is a whey protein food that supports detoxification, repair of tissues, and elimination of inflammation, healthy pH, and growth of beneficial bacteria.
[02:21:01.538 --> 02:21:05.400]  One World Whey is duly reformulated to be higher in protein and lower in carbohydrate.
[02:21:05.600 --> 02:21:11.488]  We believe One World Way is an excellent food to support your efforts to create a healthy internal body environment.

[02:21:19.959 --> 02:21:21.822]  Americans, you are being lied to.
[02:21:22.082 --> 02:21:27.984]  Does your skin crawl when a politician or a stock market guru say that we are in the midst of an economic recovery?
[02:21:28.164 --> 02:21:32.206]  According to top insiders, the largest financial meltdown in history is coming.
[02:21:32.346 --> 02:21:36.348]  You can prepare, but if you're living paycheck to paycheck, how do you find the cash?
[02:21:36.668 --> 02:21:40.869]  If you're fortunate enough to have retirement savings, it's probably not enough.
[02:21:41.029 --> 02:21:44.591]  And if it's in the market, it could be wiped out just like the last crash.
[02:21:44.791 --> 02:21:47.792]  But this time it will almost certainly be much worse.
[02:21:48.092 --> 02:21:53.275]  Precious metals are a great hedge, but they won't generate immediate cash flow to pay the bills.
[02:21:53.735 --> 02:21:56.377]  Learn the secret to creating cash flow and freedom.

[02:22:19.593 --> 02:22:23.896]  For months, the InfoWars Live Silver Bullet colloidal silver has been completely sold out.

[02:23:21.271 --> 02:23:22.191]  Today is October 29th, 2014.
[02:23:22.251 --> 02:23:22.611]  Gold opened at $1223.40.
[02:23:22.651 --> 02:23:26.333]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1268.34, $634.17 for a half ounce, or $317.09 for a quarter ounce.
[02:23:26.353 --> 02:23:26.773]  That's $1268.34, $634.17, and $317.09.
[02:23:40.598 --> 02:23:41.660]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:23:41.760 --> 02:23:46.546]  Have you ever wondered why bank, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:23:46.846 --> 02:23:47.387]  Wait a sec.
[02:23:47.527 --> 02:23:51.653]  Gold and silver is going up while Congress is trying to settle on the next debt increase.
[02:23:51.853 --> 02:23:53.295]  And there's no end to this madness.
[02:23:53.535 --> 02:23:58.582]  That old 401k and IRA can be converted into physical gold without tax consequences.
[02:23:59.042 --> 02:24:01.645]  I explained this in my book, 10 Reasons to Buy Gold.

[02:24:07.370 --> 02:24:07.410]  800-686-2237.
[02:24:30.126 --> 02:24:34.290]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:24:35.030 --> 02:24:38.313]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:24:38.353 --> 02:24:39.995]  Your Twitter questions, your phone calls.
[02:24:40.015 --> 02:24:43.978]  When we start the next segment, Rick had more he wanted to say about, quote, dumbing down.
[02:24:43.998 --> 02:24:48.002]  He was describing it like, well, I guess training wheels on the kids right into prison.
[02:24:48.662 --> 02:24:49.823]  Get more into that, Rick Ross.
[02:24:49.843 --> 02:24:53.807]  We're talking about hip-hop and how they program the kids on how they're supposed to act.
[02:24:54.181 --> 02:24:55.782]  Well, you know, like myself, Alex.
[02:24:56.082 --> 02:24:59.363]  They made me believe that I was dumb, that I couldn't read.
[02:24:59.383 --> 02:25:02.344]  And, you know, people ask me all the time, who was it?
[02:25:02.464 --> 02:25:04.525]  Was it my mom, who didn't teach me how to read?
[02:25:04.585 --> 02:25:05.285]  Was it the school?
[02:25:05.685 --> 02:25:06.546]  Well, I don't really know.
[02:25:07.106 --> 02:25:15.409]  But what I do know is that I had come up with a mentality about myself that I was dumb, that I was stupid, that
[02:25:16.812 --> 02:25:17.953]  All I should be was a thug.
[02:25:19.173 --> 02:25:22.094]  And that thugging was cool.
[02:25:22.955 --> 02:25:29.097]  And when I looked around from my prison cell and I started to look at all my friends, that they all thought the same way.
[02:25:30.158 --> 02:25:40.542]  And it was this programming that put us in this position that dealing drugs and gangbanging was easy for us to accept.
[02:25:41.003 --> 02:25:44.944]  And I believe that hip-hop is doing that right now, but on a more massive scale.
[02:25:46.883 --> 02:25:49.389]  The kids now, they wear their pants like we used to.
[02:25:50.972 --> 02:25:52.215]  They talk to things that we used to.
[02:25:52.235 --> 02:25:53.217]  They're ready for prison.
[02:25:54.239 --> 02:25:54.740]  Absolutely.
[02:25:54.760 --> 02:25:55.622]  They're ready to be punk.
[02:25:56.163 --> 02:25:56.644]  Absolutely.
[02:25:57.145 --> 02:25:57.646]  Absolutely.
[02:25:58.769 --> 02:25:59.810]  It's at an all-time high right now.
[02:25:59.850 --> 02:26:05.854]  It must be a joke to the CIA mind controllers to have the young guys already wearing their pants saying, hey, I'm ready to be raped.
[02:26:06.335 --> 02:26:11.159]  I mean, they must be really proud of the masterful job they've done.
[02:26:11.419 --> 02:26:14.561]  And now they're deploying that hip-hop culture into everything.
[02:26:14.621 --> 02:26:16.703]  It's taking over.
[02:26:17.023 --> 02:26:17.683]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:26:17.904 --> 02:26:25.548]  Endorsements, I mean, big companies, you know, companies that wouldn't touch that type of lifestyle before, you know, is all over.
[02:26:25.568 --> 02:26:30.250]  They don't want to have kids wearing sports jackets and doing well, and you've got a future, and you're a vet, no, you're crap.
[02:26:31.151 --> 02:26:34.912]  And now the rock and roll music's, oh, we're all dead, we have no future, humans are crud.
[02:26:35.233 --> 02:26:40.515]  They need us to feel bad about ourselves, that we're hurting the earth, so we roll over and basically become slaves.
[02:26:40.896 --> 02:26:41.396]  Absolutely.
[02:26:41.796 --> 02:26:43.679]  Other points you wanted to make before we got a break.
[02:26:43.759 --> 02:26:54.094]  And that's the point that I believe right now that our kids are in and that's why I'm out here on the streets working to let them know that, you know, I couldn't read but I eventually started doing law.
[02:26:55.131 --> 02:26:58.194]  You know, I found the issue that eventually helped me get out of prison.
[02:26:58.675 --> 02:27:00.417]  So, you know, I wrote a book now.
[02:27:02.199 --> 02:27:04.602]  And you're here warning people about drugs right now?
[02:27:04.822 --> 02:27:05.322]  Absolutely.
[02:27:05.523 --> 02:27:07.164]  And that's what matters is you've changed.
[02:27:07.204 --> 02:27:08.526]  You understand what you did wrong.
[02:27:09.147 --> 02:27:12.250]  And that's more valuable than somebody that never even went through the trials and tribulations.
[02:27:12.310 --> 02:27:12.851]  You're a veteran.
[02:27:13.251 --> 02:27:13.471]  Right.
[02:27:13.551 --> 02:27:17.113]  A veteran of this tyranny, and you're here seeing through the Matrix now.
[02:27:17.353 --> 02:27:18.173]  That's a beautiful thing.
[02:27:18.213 --> 02:27:27.917]  It's like Christ is on the cross, and he's there next to the thief and everything, and the thief apologizes, accepts it, his heart's right, and Christ says, tonight you'll be with me in paradise.
[02:27:28.437 --> 02:27:31.738]  But the soldiers and everybody, they just went along with it.
[02:27:32.138 --> 02:27:32.258]  Yeah.
[02:27:32.418 --> 02:27:34.459]  They think they're winners in this world, and they're not.
[02:27:36.140 --> 02:27:36.640]  Absolutely.
[02:27:39.011 --> 02:27:42.992]  Well, we've got to warn the young people to never use drugs the first time.
[02:27:43.152 --> 02:28:02.276]  I mean, marijuana is a gateway, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't decriminalize it just so they can't throw you in jail, but the whole drug culture is ruining people, and the prescription drugs are pushing on kids in the schools are worse than the illegal drugs, and just stay away from them, and realize you're not empty if you get bad grades, and so you've got to go to the dark side.
[02:28:02.756 --> 02:28:04.597]  You're not empty just because you don't have a bunch of money.
[02:28:05.197 --> 02:28:08.900]  You can paint, you can do music, you can go out and help people.
[02:28:10.922 --> 02:28:18.768]  That's what's going to empower you is going out and standing up to bullies, not just feeling bad because you don't live like people on television.
[02:28:19.328 --> 02:28:21.350]  Yeah, we all can't be on television.
[02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:27.595]  It's crazy that they tell us that if you don't have a pair of Air Jordans that you're not special.
[02:28:27.955 --> 02:28:35.617]  Well, I mean, I was happier before I had all this responsibility and was, quote, on radio and TV and barely had money to buy three pairs of shoes a year, even though that was rich compared to poor people.
[02:28:36.137 --> 02:28:37.277]  I mean, I was totally happy.
[02:28:37.297 --> 02:28:42.759]  I was thinking back to the years when I was, you know, out of high school and stuff and my parents were giving me no help because I didn't ask for it, really.
[02:28:43.139 --> 02:28:43.979]  And I was so poor.
[02:28:44.199 --> 02:28:47.700]  It was the happiest time of my life without all these responsibilities and the rest of it.
[02:28:48.120 --> 02:28:49.881]  And I'm not saying people shouldn't become successful.
[02:28:50.321 --> 02:28:53.402]  It's just that what matters is, is that you're a good person.
[02:28:53.462 --> 02:28:54.522]  That's the real value.
[02:28:54.702 --> 02:28:55.402]  It is, it is.
[02:28:55.602 --> 02:28:56.683]  And that you care about others.
[02:28:56.903 --> 02:29:00.684]  Because when you don't care about other people, then I believe that you're the worst.
[02:29:02.725 --> 02:29:06.186]  And a lot of people that's in power right now, they don't care about anything but your dollars.
[02:29:06.726 --> 02:29:06.927]  You know?
[02:29:06.947 --> 02:29:08.527]  In fact, they enjoy hurting people.
[02:29:09.207 --> 02:29:09.387]  Yeah.
[02:29:09.567 --> 02:29:21.552]  I mean, it's a diabolical plan to ship heroin in, to get millions of Americans addicted from the 50s on, and then to bring in cocaine, weaponize it as crack, which is a CIA recipe that was declassified, and to deploy it right into black neighborhoods.
[02:29:23.115 --> 02:29:24.716]  I mean, that's a nasty thing to do.
[02:29:25.136 --> 02:29:25.397]  It is.
[02:29:25.717 --> 02:29:26.237]  Absolutely.
[02:29:26.737 --> 02:29:29.119]  To a people that doesn't have, that's hopeless.
[02:29:29.159 --> 02:29:30.880]  And then to sell them thug culture.
[02:29:31.501 --> 02:29:37.925]  Cause let me tell you, you know, I'm downtown Austin and there's, you know, basically I call them black clan members, whatever, just black thug culture.
[02:29:38.105 --> 02:29:41.387]  There's white thug culture as well, but they've been told it's okay to hate white people.
[02:29:41.748 --> 02:29:44.429]  I mean, it's, you know, it's, but I don't, I see the plan though.
[02:29:44.609 --> 02:29:48.252]  I see the whole programming to make them like that and to make them hate me.
[02:29:48.512 --> 02:29:52.094]  And then I realized how it's all to divide everybody so the system can manage us.
[02:29:52.995 --> 02:29:54.396]  I mean, that's diabolical.
[02:29:54.777 --> 02:29:55.297]  Absolutely.
[02:29:55.958 --> 02:29:56.678]  That is sick.
[02:29:57.199 --> 02:29:58.120]  That is mind control.
[02:29:58.440 --> 02:30:00.702]  So we've got to transcend it, ladies and gentlemen, and defeat it.
[02:30:00.882 --> 02:30:02.544]  We'll get your take on what I just said when we come back.
[02:30:02.584 --> 02:30:05.126]  Rick Ross, go right to your phone calls and your Twitter questions.
[02:30:05.366 --> 02:30:07.068]  I'll stop hogging him right now.
[02:30:07.108 --> 02:30:08.869]  His website is I Am The Real.
[02:30:09.550 --> 02:30:10.451]  We're on the march.
[02:30:10.951 --> 02:30:12.552]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:13.493 --> 02:30:16.156]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:20.313 --> 02:30:24.195]  On the eve of Thanksgiving this year, I was thinking, what am I really thankful for?
[02:30:24.395 --> 02:30:32.478]  And I gotta tell you, it's my family, it's all the blessings of liberty that our forebearers secured, and it's you, the listeners of the broadcast, who've made everything we do possible.
[02:30:32.658 --> 02:30:40.581]  This Black Friday, I decided to bring you the biggest special we've ever offered on any of the Nutraceuticals at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:30:41.041 --> 02:30:44.784]  I'm talking about Silver Bullock Loyal Silver that we've been sold out of for months.
[02:30:45.064 --> 02:30:46.966]  This time I doubled down and got even more.
[02:30:47.246 --> 02:30:50.689]  As of me taping this on the eve of Thanksgiving, we have already sold half of it.
[02:30:50.809 --> 02:30:57.975]  So instead of keeping the price at its regular discounted price, we are going to give you 20% off and free shipping on single bottles.
[02:30:58.155 --> 02:31:01.518]  But if you get four bottles, we're gonna give you the fifth one free and the free shipping.
[02:31:01.658 --> 02:31:06.242]  I don't know how long this special will run, but if supplies last, we will extend it out until Cyber Monday.
[02:31:06.362 --> 02:31:12.107]  You'll find powerful nutraceuticals like Silver Bullet and others at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:31:12.167 --> 02:31:19.774]  Again, this is Alex Jones wishing you all a blessed and happy Thanksgiving and thanking you all for your support of freedom.
[02:31:20.333 --> 02:31:23.835]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:31:23.995 --> 02:31:27.958]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:31:28.278 --> 02:31:29.739]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:31:30.059 --> 02:31:37.644]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:31:37.924 --> 02:31:38.765]  But for how long?

[02:31:41.266 --> 02:31:45.309]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:31:45.709 --> 02:31:46.870]  Infidel Body Armor.
[02:31:47.570 --> 02:31:48.511]  Just won't quit.

[02:32:19.833 --> 02:32:21.434]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[02:32:21.774 --> 02:32:25.555]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:32:26.296 --> 02:32:30.637]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[02:32:30.757 --> 02:32:37.560]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[02:32:38.060 --> 02:32:47.144]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:32:47.364 --> 02:32:52.828]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[02:32:52.908 --> 02:33:00.173]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.

[02:33:32.529 --> 02:33:38.811]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:43.832 --> 02:33:45.753]  Rick Ross is our guest.
[02:33:45.773 --> 02:33:47.714]  We're going to go to your phone calls here in just a moment.
[02:33:47.734 --> 02:33:50.334]  There was one other point we got talking about fluoride in the water.
[02:33:50.694 --> 02:33:52.095]  What was the other point you wanted to make, you were saying?
[02:33:54.048 --> 02:33:55.249]  I lost my thought, man.
[02:33:55.489 --> 02:33:57.391]  We're having the real discussions here during the breaks.
[02:33:57.771 --> 02:34:05.997]  I've thought so many times, just for the TV audience, I ought to have a button I can hit whenever I'm not eating or making a phone call where we can put live cams in here during the breaks.
[02:34:06.077 --> 02:34:06.297]  Yeah.
[02:34:06.317 --> 02:34:08.079]  Because that's where the really good discussions are happening.
[02:34:08.439 --> 02:34:09.160]  Yeah, that would be good.
[02:34:09.200 --> 02:34:09.820]  That would be good.
[02:34:09.860 --> 02:34:15.845]  But, you know, we done touched on so many good points, man, and I'm just excited, you know, that you have me here.
[02:34:15.905 --> 02:34:17.106]  And we're touching on some of these points.
[02:34:17.546 --> 02:34:19.608]  You know, one of them, too, you know, Obama
[02:34:20.248 --> 02:34:32.696]  He wrote in the 18 to 1 crack law, you know, where it was 100 to 1 for crack and powder, where it had already been proven that powder and crack are identical drugs, except one is smokable and one is not smokable.
[02:34:34.257 --> 02:34:39.920]  So, about a year ago, they changed it 18 to 1, but they should have made it 18 to 1, and then they should have made it retroactive.
[02:34:40.300 --> 02:34:42.902]  You know, say if a guy has been in jail 25 or 30 years, but if it was 18 to 1,
[02:34:46.604 --> 02:34:49.905]  He only got five years in prison, so they would owe him some time.
[02:34:49.925 --> 02:34:50.606]  He would be released.
[02:34:50.626 --> 02:34:51.666]  Well, I totally agree.
[02:34:51.706 --> 02:34:54.467]  If you're non-violent, you should be released.
[02:34:54.588 --> 02:34:54.988]  Period.
[02:34:55.368 --> 02:34:56.929]  Because the government shipped in to begin with.
[02:34:56.949 --> 02:35:04.572]  It'd be like if your judge was the guy that sold you the cocaine, and then now he's presiding over sending you to jail for life.
[02:35:05.592 --> 02:35:06.273]  That's what it is.
[02:35:06.293 --> 02:35:09.054]  It'd be like if Hitler ran the Nuremberg trials.
[02:35:10.339 --> 02:35:12.460]  I mean, it's just, it's pure bull.
[02:35:12.540 --> 02:35:13.120]  I mean, end it.
[02:35:13.340 --> 02:35:14.040]  Yes, it is.
[02:35:14.260 --> 02:35:15.201]  And then they own the prisons.
[02:35:16.001 --> 02:35:16.441]  I remember.
[02:35:17.081 --> 02:35:18.782]  I've talked to two major rock stars.
[02:35:19.302 --> 02:35:21.063]  And it's not the two that you've heard on the show.
[02:35:22.743 --> 02:35:24.264]  I've talked to two major rock stars.
[02:35:25.538 --> 02:35:26.959]  And then I've talked to some hip-hop folks.
[02:35:26.979 --> 02:35:29.420]  They all say that they've heard the same stories.
[02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:35.663]  And some of the memos have come out about the CIA behind rock and roll to create the revolutions, you know, behind bringing the LSD in.
[02:35:35.923 --> 02:35:36.844]  That's been declassified.
[02:35:36.884 --> 02:35:40.106]  But in the early 90s, they said, look, rock's going to be dead.
[02:35:40.146 --> 02:35:40.566]  Get ready.
[02:35:41.006 --> 02:35:42.147]  We're going to bring in hip-hop.
[02:35:42.887 --> 02:35:44.088]  And we're going to gangsterize it.
[02:35:44.368 --> 02:35:46.130]  This is from the guys upstairs.
[02:35:46.430 --> 02:35:47.611]  The government wants this.
[02:35:48.252 --> 02:35:50.974]  Shumner Redstone at Viacom has been ordered to do this.
[02:35:51.635 --> 02:35:56.158]  And big managers and people were all brought in and they said, you better start flipping to this.
[02:35:56.759 --> 02:36:02.083]  That's why you saw a lot of heavy metal guys start doing rap albums and getting other folks in with them and things.
[02:36:02.384 --> 02:36:04.686]  Because they were told, we're going to play these on the record.
[02:36:05.226 --> 02:36:06.427]  And we're going to put this on the air.
[02:36:07.588 --> 02:36:09.270]  And then I talk about my personal self.
[02:36:10.606 --> 02:36:13.087]  I experimented here and there once or twice with hard drugs.
[02:36:13.227 --> 02:36:14.828]  Always had such horrible hangovers.
[02:36:15.568 --> 02:36:17.489]  Methamphetamine a couple times, cocaine a few times.
[02:36:17.529 --> 02:36:18.469]  I'm on record about that.
[02:36:19.129 --> 02:36:19.970]  I just didn't like it.
[02:36:20.930 --> 02:36:24.191]  I've always been a nicotine alcohol type guy and that I've transcended pretty much as well.
[02:36:24.451 --> 02:36:26.912]  Don't even smoke cigars anymore because I always get back on cigarettes when I do.
[02:36:27.532 --> 02:36:31.594]  But, long story short, Sheriff McWhorter
[02:36:33.601 --> 02:36:34.582]  Who later got busted.
[02:36:34.622 --> 02:36:36.383]  He was flying drugs into the Rockwall Airport.
[02:36:36.764 --> 02:36:40.007]  We lived in the richest county in Texas, right outside Dallas, Rockwall, Mille.
[02:36:40.507 --> 02:36:44.130]  And I would be at affluent people's houses for a party when their parents are out of town.
[02:36:44.811 --> 02:36:46.572]  The cheerleader down the street's having a party.
[02:36:46.953 --> 02:36:48.194]  All the 14-year-olds are over there.
[02:36:48.574 --> 02:36:51.116]  And then there'd be 16-year-olds and 18-year-olds would come over.
[02:36:51.456 --> 02:36:52.738]  Wild parties, pool parties.
[02:36:53.258 --> 02:36:54.599]  And the police car would pull up.
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:37:00.684]  And then they'd come in and go, we got the weed, we got the ecstasy, we got the methamphetamine, we got the... And I'd be like, whoa, whoa!
[02:37:01.365 --> 02:37:02.826]  You know, because they had money.
[02:37:03.306 --> 02:37:06.007]  And so many times the cops in cars would deliver the drugs.
[02:37:06.447 --> 02:37:09.669]  So I'd get pulled over a couple years later when I was driving.
[02:37:09.689 --> 02:37:11.330]  That's why we had to move to Austin.
[02:37:13.160 --> 02:37:15.421]  I've told you, this has been in Esquire, it's been in Texas Monthly.
[02:37:15.861 --> 02:37:16.721]  They didn't believe a lot of it.
[02:37:16.741 --> 02:37:22.302]  Went and checked and went, wow, there were a bunch of busts in the Rockwall PD and the county and flying in cocaine.
[02:37:22.322 --> 02:37:22.903]  I remember that.
[02:37:23.063 --> 02:37:23.523]  I remember that.
[02:37:23.543 --> 02:37:25.403]  It was in the newspapers and Reddit.
[02:37:25.963 --> 02:37:31.625]  So they were flooding it with drugs and they would want to search my car and I'd go, man, I saw you two years ago deliver drugs.
[02:37:32.785 --> 02:37:38.248]  Beat me up, take me to jail, threatened to hang me, told my dad's lawyer, move out or we're going to kill him, basically.
[02:37:38.508 --> 02:37:39.049]  Yeah.
[02:37:39.069 --> 02:37:42.230]  And a couple years, we moved out, and then later the feds came in and busted him.
[02:37:43.171 --> 02:37:45.792]  But again, that's the big drug dealer busting the little drug dealer.
[02:37:46.373 --> 02:37:49.394]  Yeah, well you know, that's why they don't like you, Alex, because you're going to keep it 100.
[02:37:49.434 --> 02:37:51.856]  You're going to let them know exactly what's going on.
[02:37:52.176 --> 02:37:55.898]  Well, I wasn't saying anything about the cops stealing drugs until they wanted to search me.
[02:37:55.918 --> 02:37:56.458]  Yeah.
[02:37:57.279 --> 02:37:58.779]  And I'm like, man, you're a drug dealer.
[02:37:59.620 --> 02:38:01.341]  Leave my six pack of beer alone.
[02:38:03.183 --> 02:38:08.867]  Oh, look, you know, like under the truck seat, those, those, um, Silverados had the seat that lifted up the middle.
[02:38:09.047 --> 02:38:09.307]  Yeah.
[02:38:09.388 --> 02:38:10.368]  And there was the six pack.
[02:38:10.408 --> 02:38:11.389]  We weren't even drinking and driving.
[02:38:11.409 --> 02:38:14.691]  We were going to a party and they're like, all right, I got you a minor in possession.
[02:38:14.731 --> 02:38:16.593]  I was just like, you're a drug dealer.
[02:38:18.734 --> 02:38:21.096]  Almost like the fox watching the hen house, huh?
[02:38:21.516 --> 02:38:22.997]  Well, yeah, it's like, you're a drug dealer.
[02:38:23.017 --> 02:38:24.899]  You're going to give me a ticket, take my beer.
[02:38:25.759 --> 02:38:26.580]  Those cops would just go,
[02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:29.580]  They arrested me three times doing that.
[02:38:29.920 --> 02:38:30.381]  Wow.
[02:38:31.481 --> 02:38:32.341]  They would beat me up that bad.
[02:38:32.361 --> 02:38:34.922]  They'd slam my head in the wall and they'd take me there and go, listen.
[02:38:34.942 --> 02:38:36.122]  They didn't beat you with a flashlight?
[02:38:36.282 --> 02:38:36.662]  No, no.
[02:38:36.862 --> 02:38:37.582]  You've been beat up before.
[02:38:37.602 --> 02:38:41.303]  I've been beat with a flashlight while I was handcuffed and let the dog bite me while I was handcuffed.
[02:38:41.383 --> 02:38:44.984]  I mean, these guys are wow, wow.
[02:38:45.764 --> 02:38:48.225]  You know, these, what do you call them, cowboys?
[02:38:48.685 --> 02:38:48.925]  Yeah.
[02:38:48.965 --> 02:38:52.586]  These drug enforcement agents, you know, they're just out there, man.
[02:38:53.126 --> 02:38:54.167]  Most of them are dealers.
[02:38:54.687 --> 02:38:55.547]  Yeah, running rampant.
[02:38:56.627 --> 02:38:58.629]  And, you know, ripping off the public.
[02:38:59.751 --> 02:39:01.052]  Because they're not solving the problem.
[02:39:01.673 --> 02:39:03.976]  Well, now they're so arrogant, even the New York Times reports on it.
[02:39:04.376 --> 02:39:08.121]  They're taking people's cash out of their wallets that have no criminal record, no drugs.
[02:39:08.141 --> 02:39:09.583]  They just go, oh, two grand in your wallet?
[02:39:09.663 --> 02:39:10.444]  Bam, I'm taking it.
[02:39:10.464 --> 02:39:11.866]  Well, you know, Gary stopped that, too.
[02:39:12.387 --> 02:39:13.768]  You remember, they used to have a forfeiture.
[02:39:14.537 --> 02:39:15.337]  Remember the forfeiture laws?
[02:39:15.357 --> 02:39:16.778]  He got it kicked out of the states, yeah.
[02:39:16.958 --> 02:39:18.539]  He made them change their forfeiture laws.
[02:39:18.799 --> 02:39:26.663]  You know, before they could pull you over and say they found a joint in your car and they could take your car and forfeit it.
[02:39:27.303 --> 02:39:31.125]  You go to court and the court throw your case out and you never go to jail and never found guilty.
[02:39:31.165 --> 02:39:34.587]  He did get it reformed but now they came back with the feds, federalized it and they do it now.
[02:39:35.027 --> 02:39:35.628]  Through the police.
[02:39:36.528 --> 02:39:37.528]  Gary did do so much.
[02:39:37.568 --> 02:39:38.688]  Let's go to these calls here.
[02:39:39.028 --> 02:39:39.969]  Folks, get his book.
[02:39:40.029 --> 02:39:52.971]  It's available right now at InfoWarsStore.com or you can go to FreewayRick.com or IAmTheRealRickRoss.com and get the book, Rick Ross, The Untold Autobiography, and give it to the young people in your life, especially any that are getting on drugs.
[02:39:53.711 --> 02:39:59.692]  Donnie McClure asked the question on Twitter, can you elaborate on the rapper Rick Ross and how he stole your image?
[02:39:59.712 --> 02:40:00.772]  I think you already answered that.
[02:40:01.072 --> 02:40:02.213]  And do you like his music?
[02:40:02.233 --> 02:40:02.833]  Do you like his music?
[02:40:03.293 --> 02:40:03.513]  I do.
[02:40:04.333 --> 02:40:04.553]  I do.
[02:40:04.773 --> 02:40:05.354]  You can't help it.
[02:40:05.374 --> 02:40:08.336]  I mean, they have a formula that they're doing with this music.
[02:40:08.996 --> 02:40:10.937]  And you know, our heart beats off of a rhythm.
[02:40:11.758 --> 02:40:12.918]  So they manipulate us, yeah?
[02:40:13.639 --> 02:40:14.219]  Absolutely.
[02:40:14.399 --> 02:40:23.164]  So, and then you hear the music, if you turn on the radio, and I don't really listen to the radio when I like it, you know, because you can't help but hear this music everywhere you go.
[02:40:23.625 --> 02:40:28.507]  You know, you're on the elevator, you're here, you're in the supermarket, you're riding down the street and somebody else is playing in the car.
[02:40:28.527 --> 02:40:31.069]  Well, that's what makes me mad is my kids can't help but like it.
[02:40:31.369 --> 02:40:31.909]  Absolutely.
[02:40:32.069 --> 02:40:34.350]  And if the message was good, it'd be great, but it's weaponized.
[02:40:34.370 --> 02:40:35.291]  The message is bad.
[02:40:35.471 --> 02:40:41.534]  Yeah, it's not motivation, uplifting, you know, telling that you can be somebody special and that you are special no matter what situation.
[02:40:41.554 --> 02:40:44.755]  No, it's like, you gotta be a gangster slinging a rock, the hoes, the, you know.
[02:40:47.056 --> 02:40:47.677]  You got it.
[02:40:49.097 --> 02:40:50.178]  Yeah.
[02:40:50.938 --> 02:40:53.079]  Rick Ross, did you do any business with the CIA?
[02:40:53.119 --> 02:40:54.080]  Well, that's a silly question.
[02:40:55.638 --> 02:40:56.319]  Not knowingly.
[02:40:57.580 --> 02:40:59.301]  Yeah, they had an intermediary between you and them.
[02:40:59.541 --> 02:41:01.984]  Yeah, yeah, Danilo Blandon, the CIA operative.
[02:41:02.364 --> 02:41:03.185]  That's what they call it.
[02:41:03.445 --> 02:41:05.226]  He's not an agent, but he's an operative.
[02:41:05.246 --> 02:41:05.967]  It's a membrane.
[02:41:09.610 --> 02:41:11.291]  Do you know Henry Hill?
[02:41:11.892 --> 02:41:13.233]  Was or ever met Henry Hill?
[02:41:13.273 --> 02:41:15.775]  And if so, how much of a piece of bleep was he?
[02:41:15.815 --> 02:41:16.456]  I don't even know who that is.
[02:41:16.676 --> 02:41:17.217]  No, me either.
[02:41:17.517 --> 02:41:18.117]  Never heard of him.
[02:41:18.137 --> 02:41:18.498]  All right.
[02:41:19.479 --> 02:41:20.860]  We've got more Twitter questions coming in.
[02:41:20.880 --> 02:41:21.640]  We're going to go to calls.
[02:41:23.570 --> 02:41:27.414]  MKT says, what was your first major purchase after making all your drug money?
[02:41:28.536 --> 02:41:29.677]  My first major purchase?
[02:41:30.337 --> 02:41:32.660]  I bought a piece of property that I built a motel on.
[02:41:32.960 --> 02:41:33.461]  That's smart.
[02:41:35.123 --> 02:41:41.590]  Adam Russell asks on iChats, Rick, do you think the government was involved in creating the fake rappers persona to basically troll you?
[02:41:43.191 --> 02:41:44.473]  Sure, I don't think Rick Ross came up with that.
[02:41:45.649 --> 02:41:55.567]  I don't know if they did it to, I don't know what troll me mean, uh, but what I know that happened is they gave it him authenticity, you know, where it was, I thought it was authentic.
[02:41:56.248 --> 02:41:56.469]  Yeah.
[02:41:59.372 --> 02:42:01.993]  In my community, I'm a legend.
[02:42:02.433 --> 02:42:08.454]  People's mothers and fathers had talked about me, so it had already been ingrained in people that Rick Ross was something.
[02:42:08.514 --> 02:42:17.196]  And so when the name came out, people automatically liked that name because they looked at me as almost like a Robin Hood.
[02:42:17.516 --> 02:42:19.296]  Well, Rick Ross rolls off the tongue.
[02:42:19.316 --> 02:42:19.857]  It sounds cool.
[02:42:20.337 --> 02:42:20.577]  Yeah.
[02:42:23.021 --> 02:42:26.443]  When they did him, he already had love for the community.
[02:42:26.483 --> 02:42:27.764]  The community already had love for him.
[02:42:27.824 --> 02:42:36.130]  I don't know if you know who Freddie Fox is, but Freddie Fox told me one time, he was like, man, when I heard that Rick Ross was performing in New York, I went to the show.
[02:42:37.331 --> 02:42:40.493]  And when I got to the show, I see this guy and I was like, that ain't none of my man!
[02:42:42.354 --> 02:42:44.175]  So, they already had a love for Rick Ross.
[02:42:44.776 --> 02:42:49.919]  And what he did is he got that love that the streets had for me, you know, because I was a gangster.
[02:42:49.979 --> 02:42:50.880]  I was out there in the streets.
[02:42:52.856 --> 02:42:53.637]  That's what they wanted.
[02:42:54.257 --> 02:42:56.158]  And he fitted that role, so.
[02:42:58.700 --> 02:43:01.682]  What are some of the things that motivate you today, K-D-E-E ask?
[02:43:03.003 --> 02:43:04.544]  Well, uh, redemption.
[02:43:04.984 --> 02:43:16.811]  You know, to redeem myself, uh, to show young people that, um, no matter where you at today, that you can always improve yourself and become a better person.
[02:43:19.273 --> 02:43:21.594]  How do you pronounce that caller's name, Vladislav?
[02:43:23.388 --> 02:43:24.149]  Vladislav?
[02:43:24.470 --> 02:43:26.773]  Then we're going to go to Vladislav here in just a moment.
[02:43:26.793 --> 02:43:31.880]  In fact, let's go to Vladislav now in Washington here on the air with the real Rick Ross.
[02:43:33.612 --> 02:43:34.272]  Hello, Rick.
[02:43:34.332 --> 02:43:36.434]  My name is Vladislav here in Battleground Washington.
[02:43:37.334 --> 02:43:39.555]  My question is very basic to you.
[02:43:39.615 --> 02:43:42.917]  Basically, what motivated you to deal the drugs with the CIA?
[02:43:43.537 --> 02:43:45.018]  And afterwards, what changed your mind?
[02:43:45.158 --> 02:43:46.379]  But has anybody been listening?
[02:43:46.399 --> 02:43:56.564]  He didn't know he was dealing drugs with the CIA until it came out in court because the operative that was a supplier from the Air Force Base hadn't told him that.
[02:43:56.644 --> 02:43:59.226]  So I don't mean to answer his question for you, but...
[02:44:00.126 --> 02:44:01.706]  I mean, what motivated you to deal drugs?
[02:44:01.746 --> 02:44:02.407]  I think you said that.
[02:44:02.467 --> 02:44:02.927]  Money, right?
[02:44:03.047 --> 02:44:03.487]  Poverty.
[02:44:03.667 --> 02:44:03.927]  Money.
[02:44:04.327 --> 02:44:04.807]  Yeah.
[02:44:05.107 --> 02:44:10.448]  I was tired of my mom struggling and not having food in the refrigerator.
[02:44:11.209 --> 02:44:15.350]  You know, there's been days that me and my brothers and sisters woke up and there was nothing in there to eat.
[02:44:15.610 --> 02:44:16.690]  I've got a question to ask you.
[02:44:16.710 --> 02:44:17.290]  Thank you, caller.
[02:44:17.310 --> 02:44:17.690]  I appreciate it.
[02:44:17.710 --> 02:44:18.350]  I'm not trying to be mean.
[02:44:18.370 --> 02:44:19.191]  He just answered that.
[02:44:22.931 --> 02:44:29.333]  What does your mother think, kind of like that Scarface story, what does your mother think when suddenly you had all this money?
[02:44:30.134 --> 02:44:33.275]  Well, you know, my mom put me out of the house when she first found out I was dealing drugs.
[02:44:33.595 --> 02:44:35.216]  You know, my mom was a diorite Christian.
[02:44:36.076 --> 02:44:39.318]  And, uh, you know, first thing came to her mind, oh, you're going to hell forever.
[02:44:40.018 --> 02:44:41.338]  So, uh, she threw me out the house.
[02:44:41.879 --> 02:44:45.600]  Uh, but when she did, I was already, I was already ghetto rich.
[02:44:45.640 --> 02:44:46.840]  I had a hundred thousand dollars.
[02:44:48.021 --> 02:44:51.322]  So everybody in the neighborhood wanted me to come to their house and stay.
[02:44:51.842 --> 02:44:55.944]  Uh, but eventually she, she started to succumb to the money.
[02:44:56.707 --> 02:45:08.840]  You know, I bought pool pits for the church and air conditioners and you know, I remodeled her house where she didn't have holes in the floors and had exterminated, you know, put the tent over to get rid of the rats and the roaches.
[02:45:08.880 --> 02:45:12.724]  And I was still her son.
[02:45:13.185 --> 02:45:16.428]  So no matter what happened, you know, she still loved me and adored me.
[02:45:19.309 --> 02:45:20.371]  Our relationship never changed.
[02:45:20.391 --> 02:45:20.732]  That's right.
[02:45:20.752 --> 02:45:22.335]  There's nothing more powerful than the flesh.
[02:45:22.896 --> 02:45:23.898]  Flesh of my flesh.
[02:45:24.799 --> 02:45:26.442]  Let's go to Julio in Wyoming.
[02:45:26.483 --> 02:45:28.246]  Julio, welcome to the Airwaves with Rick Ross.
[02:45:28.446 --> 02:45:29.007]  What up Julio?
[02:45:30.017 --> 02:45:31.858]  Hey, what's going on, Rick Ross?
[02:45:32.038 --> 02:45:41.183]  I first learned about you in college when I was a sophomore, when I first heard about Alex Jones, and I want to say God bless you for what you're doing and speaking out against the drug culture.
[02:45:41.623 --> 02:45:47.146]  Studying media in college, it's clear we have this predictive program society.
[02:45:47.366 --> 02:45:55.991]  A quick story I want to share, just living in Wyoming for a couple months, I've interacted with someone who I work with at my radio station, his brother-in-law,
[02:45:56.787 --> 02:46:11.604]  He works for a pharmaceutical company and he legally, I used air quotes on that, legally purchases methamphetamines and cocaine for the big drug manufacturers and they go all over the country to pick up legal purchases.
[02:46:12.945 --> 02:46:16.966]  But I completely agree with what you and Alex are talking about with predictive programming.
[02:46:16.986 --> 02:46:25.369]  There was a movie that came out, what, a couple years ago, Two Guns, with Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg, and again, they kind of just threw it in our face.
[02:46:25.469 --> 02:46:27.570]  They just admit the CIA's bringing the drugs in.
[02:46:27.590 --> 02:46:30.251]  It's all just flapping it in our face.
[02:46:31.031 --> 02:46:34.252]  They admit the Army, the Air Force, they're all doing this.
[02:46:34.292 --> 02:46:39.774]  My question to you, Rick Ross, is what's one of the biggest keys
[02:46:40.521 --> 02:46:43.663]  For us to talk to the youth about drugs.
[02:46:43.703 --> 02:46:49.826]  Here in Wyoming, the Native American culture, they're in a huge rat hole because of methamphetamine use.
[02:46:49.986 --> 02:46:59.532]  And the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which is basically the FBI for Native Americans, they're the ones who are helping push methamphetamine use here.
[02:46:59.552 --> 02:47:00.593]  So how do we talk to
[02:47:03.374 --> 02:47:03.975]  To the people.
[02:47:04.015 --> 02:47:06.038]  How do we even engage the police officers?
[02:47:06.238 --> 02:47:15.270]  At Schaumburg, Illinois, a big suburb of Chicago, recently they've been caught stealing drugs themselves and stealing it from drug dealers and pushing it on the culture.
[02:47:15.290 --> 02:47:15.951]  Well that's it!
[02:47:16.412 --> 02:47:17.774]  And look, they have to stop!
[02:47:18.959 --> 02:47:28.932]  They got rid of alcohol prohibition, now they brought in this new prohibition, and now they want to grab our kids, and it's just, there's never enough, and they laugh on TV and pass Obamacare that's a giant screwjob.
[02:47:29.292 --> 02:47:30.934]  I mean, this thing is out of control.
[02:47:31.314 --> 02:47:32.616]  They're killing the golden goose.
[02:47:32.856 --> 02:47:33.998]  Rick Ross, how do we stop?
[02:47:34.418 --> 02:47:37.521]  Well, I think what you're doing right now, Alex, is a start.
[02:47:37.702 --> 02:47:38.983]  This is how you got to get started.
[02:47:39.003 --> 02:47:42.086]  Because, you know, you're talking about fighting the thousand-pound gorilla.
[02:47:42.586 --> 02:47:45.830]  And you're not going to whoop him, you know, just going head up with him.
[02:47:45.970 --> 02:47:49.253]  And you got to sit down and think and talk like Alex is doing right now.
[02:47:49.653 --> 02:47:51.756]  And, you know, most people don't even want to talk about these issues.
[02:47:52.276 --> 02:47:56.579]  That's right, you gotta force it out there till everybody knows, and it's starting to happen.
[02:47:56.960 --> 02:48:05.046]  Yeah, and once you start to do that, then you can start attacking it, because when people are dumb, and remember how I was?
[02:48:05.086 --> 02:48:10.950]  I was dumb, illiterate, you know, I never read a book, you know, never heard Alex Jones, or nothing.
[02:48:10.990 --> 02:48:14.333]  I didn't know anything, so anything that somebody brought to me, I went for it.
[02:48:15.113 --> 02:48:21.318]  You know, they bring it to you, oh this is for you, it's good for you, take it and use it, and this is how you do it, and then you find yourself caught up in stuff that
[02:48:22.308 --> 02:48:23.709]  Uh, you never thought you could have been a spy?
[02:48:23.729 --> 02:48:34.175]  Well, see, my dad and mom were big into history, and so my dad would tell me when I was young, you know, the government brings in the drugs, here's the big biz Brzezinski's book where he admits it, uh, and, and, and when you're old enough, read it.
[02:48:34.876 --> 02:48:41.620]  And, I mean, and I just thought everybody knew this stuff, and then there were the police dealing drugs, just like my dad said, and then I've, I've had Serpico on.
[02:48:41.640 --> 02:48:43.181]  What do you think about his story?
[02:48:43.201 --> 02:48:44.962]  You know, they, they, police shot him in the face.
[02:48:46.451 --> 02:48:48.333]  Yeah, I mean... Because he didn't want to deal drugs?
[02:48:49.914 --> 02:48:54.018]  I mean, that... He said the entire New York narcotics department and we're all dealing drugs.
[02:48:54.578 --> 02:48:54.838]  Wow.
[02:48:54.918 --> 02:48:56.059]  I said, what percentage?
[02:48:56.080 --> 02:48:56.380]  He said 100%.
[02:48:56.440 --> 02:48:58.241]  Wow.
[02:48:58.301 --> 02:48:59.002]  Everyone he knew.
[02:48:59.963 --> 02:49:01.905]  And then he was even letting them deal the drugs?
[02:49:01.925 --> 02:49:03.706]  He just said, and they still tried to kill him.
[02:49:05.648 --> 02:49:06.028]  Crazy.
[02:49:06.789 --> 02:49:07.670]  Absolutely crazy.
[02:49:07.850 --> 02:49:08.550]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[02:49:08.591 --> 02:49:09.331]  Thank you, Julio.
[02:49:09.351 --> 02:49:10.612]  Let's go to another caller here.
[02:49:10.953 --> 02:49:11.893]  Jacob in Missouri.
[02:49:11.953 --> 02:49:13.335]  Go ahead, you're on the air with Rick Ross.
[02:49:14.349 --> 02:49:15.289]  Yeah, how you guys doing?
[02:49:15.369 --> 02:49:19.391]  I just got a quick question for each one of you, if you can bear with me real quick.
[02:49:19.871 --> 02:49:23.132]  I don't use this word at all, but this is an epic, epic interview.
[02:49:23.272 --> 02:49:26.654]  This is a workout interview right here.
[02:49:26.874 --> 02:49:39.739]  But real quick, Mr. Ross, I literally did a fist bump when I heard you say that you're getting ready to do something with Professor Griff.
[02:49:40.239 --> 02:49:41.400]  I have four brothers.
[02:49:43.058 --> 02:49:45.719]  A couple of us, we're so much alike, we don't get along.
[02:49:45.759 --> 02:49:49.061]  A couple of us, we don't see eye to eye on everything.
[02:49:49.501 --> 02:49:53.703]  We have to drop our differences.
[02:49:53.823 --> 02:49:58.546]  What comes next is my question to you and then I have a question for Alex, too.
[02:49:59.386 --> 02:50:00.166]  What's next?
[02:50:01.247 --> 02:50:07.270]  Can you just get with people like Immoral Technique, KRS-One, and just combine?
[02:50:07.350 --> 02:50:09.151]  Everybody needs to organize and get together.
[02:50:10.388 --> 02:50:12.950]  I agree, but Professor Griffiths wanted to work with me, but I've gotten too busy.
[02:50:13.230 --> 02:50:23.857]  We need to get in the system's face, because they want to control music, and say, we know you're doing it, here's the master plan, here's how you laid it out, and people don't put up with these gangbangers anymore.
[02:50:24.057 --> 02:50:26.999]  They're nothing but soldiers of the New World Order to destroy our communities.
[02:50:27.679 --> 02:50:30.000]  People need to laugh at these gangbangers, not make them heroes.
[02:50:30.020 --> 02:50:30.781]  That's my point, sorry.
[02:50:31.101 --> 02:50:31.941]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[02:50:33.102 --> 02:50:34.902]  We definitely got to do that, hit him right in the face.
[02:50:34.982 --> 02:50:38.984]  And like I said before, what Alex is doing right now, most people won't even talk to me.
[02:50:39.324 --> 02:50:43.425]  They don't want to sit down and debate with me what happened in my life and what I went through.
[02:50:43.445 --> 02:50:47.206]  What they want to do is just say, you're no good two-bit drug dealer.
[02:50:48.166 --> 02:50:49.807]  You should have stayed in prison for the rest of your life.
[02:50:49.927 --> 02:50:51.287]  You shouldn't even be out of prison.
[02:50:52.168 --> 02:50:53.228]  They don't want to look at the facts.
[02:50:53.528 --> 02:50:56.969]  Why I didn't learn how to read till I was 28 years old?
[02:50:57.309 --> 02:50:58.650]  Why was the school pushing me through?
[02:50:59.650 --> 02:51:01.411]  And these are the issues that need to be dealt with.
[02:51:01.451 --> 02:51:05.772]  You know, why are there 600,000 black men, just black men?
[02:51:05.892 --> 02:51:11.714]  And why this country has 2.2 million people in prison right now, and I think like 50-something million on paper.
[02:51:12.815 --> 02:51:14.535]  It's unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:51:14.595 --> 02:51:16.256]  Final segment, let me do some overdrive.
[02:51:16.476 --> 02:51:18.517]  With the real Rick Ross, I'm Alex Jones.

[02:53:18.064 --> 02:53:18.845]  Effective.
[02:53:19.445 --> 02:53:23.429]  On the eve of Thanksgiving this year, I was thinking, what am I really thankful for?
[02:53:23.449 --> 02:53:31.596]  And I gotta tell you, it's my family, it's all the blessings of liberty that our forebearers secured, and it's you, the listeners of the broadcast, who've made everything we do possible.
[02:53:31.756 --> 02:53:39.683]  This Black Friday, I decided to bring you the biggest special we've ever offered on any of the Nutraceuticals at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:53:40.123 --> 02:53:43.885]  I'm talking about silver bullet colloidal silver that we've been sold out of for months.
[02:53:44.145 --> 02:53:46.046]  This time I doubled down and got even more.
[02:53:46.326 --> 02:53:49.808]  As of me taping this on the eve of Thanksgiving, we have already sold half of it.
[02:53:49.888 --> 02:53:57.072]  So instead of keeping the price at its regular discounted price, we are going to give you 20% off and free shipping on single bottles.
[02:53:57.232 --> 02:54:00.594]  But if you get four bottles, we're gonna give you the fifth one free and the free shipping.
[02:54:00.734 --> 02:54:05.338]  I don't know how long this special will run, but if supplies last, we will extend it out until Cyber Monday.

[02:54:26.687 --> 02:54:27.307]  We're back, folks.
[02:54:27.347 --> 02:54:30.428]  We're going to do a little bit of overdrive so we can get to more of your phone calls.
[02:54:30.468 --> 02:54:33.409]  Stephen, James, Mike, Mark, and others.
[02:54:35.050 --> 02:54:38.411]  But before we go any further, some really good Twitter questions are coming in.
[02:54:38.431 --> 02:54:41.812]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:54:43.552 --> 02:54:44.533]  I forgot that had a liner.
[02:54:45.333 --> 02:54:46.193]  It is Alex Jones.
[02:54:46.213 --> 02:54:47.834]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:54:47.874 --> 02:54:49.074]  So many good questions here.
[02:54:52.011 --> 02:54:54.212]  Here's a question that I want to get to.
[02:54:54.852 --> 02:54:59.173]  Have you ever reached out to big artists about de-glorifying drug dealing, i.e.
[02:54:59.233 --> 02:55:00.453]  Jay-Z, etc.?
[02:55:00.833 --> 02:55:02.293]  And if so, what was their reaction?
[02:55:02.834 --> 02:55:09.915]  Well, I tried to reach out to everybody in hip-hop about us coming together and changing this culture and so forth.
[02:55:10.035 --> 02:55:10.956]  Nobody would touch me.
[02:55:11.896 --> 02:55:17.837]  Did have a meeting with Dr. Dre and brought up the subject and I was cut off.
[02:55:20.098 --> 02:55:20.378]  Really?
[02:55:20.758 --> 02:55:20.918]  Yeah.
[02:55:22.318 --> 02:55:25.239]  So right now I'm out on my own.
[02:55:25.259 --> 02:55:32.721]  So the man, people know, you talk about this, you push this poison culture, or the big boys aren't going to put you on the radio?
[02:55:32.741 --> 02:55:33.861]  Oh, absolutely not.
[02:55:34.081 --> 02:55:34.961]  They're not going to touch me.
[02:55:34.981 --> 02:55:36.561]  You start doing the things that I'm doing.
[02:55:37.662 --> 02:55:41.303]  You know, I have to sell my t-shirts, and I bought you one of my shirts, too.
[02:55:41.343 --> 02:55:41.903]  Thank you, sir.
[02:55:42.383 --> 02:55:46.204]  I have to sell my t-shirts and my books to pay my way around the country.
[02:55:46.224 --> 02:55:46.804]  Good looking shirt.
[02:55:47.044 --> 02:55:47.724]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:55:47.744 --> 02:55:51.025]  How do folks book you to come speak to their college, their church, or their high school?
[02:55:51.385 --> 02:56:01.491]  They can get me on Instagram or Twitter or my website RickRossBooks.com or Freeway Rick website and they can book me there.
[02:56:02.032 --> 02:56:02.892]  I'm going to wear this shirt.
[02:56:02.912 --> 02:56:03.893]  I hope it's an extra large.
[02:56:03.913 --> 02:56:04.193]  It is.
[02:56:04.253 --> 02:56:04.874]  It's an extra large.
[02:56:04.914 --> 02:56:05.994]  I told you I was big.
[02:56:06.194 --> 02:56:08.636]  The real Rick Ross is not a rapper.
[02:56:08.676 --> 02:56:10.817]  I tell you, I'm going to wear this shirt.
[02:56:11.538 --> 02:56:12.418]  And it's a nice shirt too.
[02:56:12.478 --> 02:56:13.459]  You feel the quality?
[02:56:13.559 --> 02:56:14.540]  I love that fabric.
[02:56:14.620 --> 02:56:17.682]  Yeah, I used some nice cotton because I know we like nice things.
[02:56:17.722 --> 02:56:18.962]  So I hooked it up.
[02:56:20.587 --> 02:56:23.208]  I think it's important that we send a message to all these guys.
[02:56:23.368 --> 02:56:26.129]  You know, everybody who's promoting this drug culture.
[02:56:26.149 --> 02:56:30.410]  I like the fact that Mark Dice, one of our contributors, he really goes after Rick Ross.
[02:56:30.430 --> 02:56:30.830]  I love Mark.
[02:56:30.930 --> 02:56:31.590]  I love Mark.
[02:56:32.251 --> 02:56:32.811]  He's awesome.
[02:56:32.831 --> 02:56:33.431]  You know who he is.
[02:56:33.471 --> 02:56:33.771]  Good, good.
[02:56:33.791 --> 02:56:34.731]  Yeah, I know who Mark is.
[02:56:34.811 --> 02:56:35.852]  Mark is wonderful.
[02:56:35.892 --> 02:56:42.914]  You know, he hits me up on Twitter and Instagram and we talk about the whole Nine Yards and he went in on the rapper for what he did, you know, and what he's doing.
[02:56:44.693 --> 02:56:45.733]  And I think more people should.
[02:56:46.073 --> 02:56:51.215]  He stole your identity to sell kids on going to prison.
[02:56:51.675 --> 02:56:52.675]  That's got to make you mad.
[02:56:52.695 --> 02:56:53.995]  Yeah, it should.
[02:56:54.075 --> 02:56:55.056]  It should make everybody mad.
[02:56:55.156 --> 02:57:02.377]  And not only mad at him, but mad at the radio stations, mad at the Universal and Warner Brothers.
[02:57:02.617 --> 02:57:05.578]  I don't think adults know what's in this music.
[02:57:07.399 --> 02:57:08.559]  Let me ask you another question here.
[02:57:11.232 --> 02:57:22.147]  I know it's a lofty task, says Brandon Bula, but will we ever see Gary Webb's third book, the person says second, but it would have been his third book, put out by Infowars and the Railroad Cross.
[02:57:22.587 --> 02:57:26.352]  Yeah, I tried to reach out to the family, but they were so scared they never talked to me after they killed him.
[02:57:27.654 --> 02:57:28.696]  Whatever happened to that book?
[02:57:29.990 --> 02:57:30.430]  I don't know.
[02:57:30.611 --> 02:57:36.935]  I mean, you know, I was still in prison when all that happened, so... Maybe you're the guy to reach out to the family.
[02:57:36.955 --> 02:57:38.395]  Have you talked to them since the movie premiere?
[02:57:38.616 --> 02:57:39.876]  I spoke to... No, not since.
[02:57:39.956 --> 02:57:41.858]  I spoke to the wife at a length.
[02:57:41.898 --> 02:57:43.479]  You know, we talked for about 15 minutes.
[02:57:43.879 --> 02:57:48.262]  It was the first time that we had time to sit and talk outside of prison.
[02:57:48.282 --> 02:57:50.943]  When I was in prison, I spoke to her on the phone.
[02:57:51.524 --> 02:57:52.204]  So maybe I should.
[02:57:52.224 --> 02:57:53.325]  I got her phone number now.
[02:57:53.565 --> 02:57:56.167]  So maybe I'll reach out to her and ask her if we can get those notes.
[02:57:57.358 --> 02:58:00.901]  Well, he had a whole book written and he sent me a disk, but it got lost and everything.
[02:58:01.141 --> 02:58:04.544]  Would you be willing to help do that?
[02:58:04.584 --> 02:58:08.807]  Listen, last time I talked to Gary, I was busy.
[02:58:08.867 --> 02:58:10.468]  I said, man, everybody knows the government deals drugs.
[02:58:10.508 --> 02:58:11.209]  I've had you on the show.
[02:58:11.229 --> 02:58:12.310]  I want to get you on again.
[02:58:12.330 --> 02:58:13.751]  He's like, no, not until my book's out.
[02:58:13.771 --> 02:58:14.892]  And then he called back a month later.
[02:58:14.912 --> 02:58:16.173]  He goes, listen, I gave you all those documents.
[02:58:16.193 --> 02:58:16.973]  Put them up on the site.
[02:58:17.474 --> 02:58:19.816]  You know, I need somebody to put this stuff on an internet site.
[02:58:20.256 --> 02:58:21.357]  And I was like, OK, but...
[02:58:23.223 --> 02:58:27.645]  And then he was like, he didn't really cuss a lot, but he's like, damn it, when you're ready to do something about this, you give me a call.
[02:58:27.685 --> 02:58:28.065]  Bang!
[02:58:28.646 --> 02:58:30.807]  I'm sure somebody probably got those notes now, though.
[02:58:30.887 --> 02:58:32.988]  I'd be surprised if his wife still has that stuff.
[02:58:33.268 --> 02:58:34.228]  But he was passionate.
[02:58:34.248 --> 02:58:36.369]  I mean, he was telling me, you need to, you need to get up.
[02:58:36.409 --> 02:58:37.110]  Oh, without a doubt.
[02:58:37.170 --> 02:58:41.692]  I mean, Gary was, he was willing to, I mean, Gary told me before that people have died for going down this road.
[02:58:41.912 --> 02:58:48.555]  You know, I mean, he's like, hey, Rick, when you go down this street here, you know, like I know going down the drug street, selling drugs, you could get killed.
[02:58:49.477 --> 02:58:54.701]  Well, Gary told me that there's been people that went down the same road that he was going down that gotten killed.
[02:58:55.181 --> 02:58:56.262]  He told me that.
[02:58:56.282 --> 02:58:58.904]  People like Gary Webb are true modern-day heroes.
