[00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:26.422]  Today I'm going to hear to talk to you a little bit about a Infamous Wars report that states the Spokane County deputies stated that we need a armored personnel vehicle to deal with constitutionalists that have
[00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:29.111]  Stockpiled ammunition.
[00:00:46.311 --> 00:00:50.314]  That report in and of itself is very misleading.
[00:00:50.834 --> 00:01:15.472]  What you haven't been told is a particular interview started by a lady filming deputies at a charity function that were working with the MRAP and her whole contention was that we were trying to desensitize children to the fact that we had
[00:01:16.693 --> 00:01:17.133]  I'm good.
[00:01:35.165 --> 00:01:39.408]  Because we are engaged in real journalism here.
[00:01:40.148 --> 00:01:42.490]  We go wherever the truth leads us.
[00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.373]  Now, we've seen a long slide towards a paramilitary police state in this country.
[00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:53.477]  I've been talking about it for a long time, made four films on the subject since the late 1990s, and we are now here.
[00:01:54.017 --> 00:01:57.480]  They've gone from denying that this is happening to admitting it.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.604]  The FBI, the DHS, and the nation's police departments, they are being trained that we are the enemy.
[00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:10.046]  And look, I've got here a Department of Justice Constitutionalist Extremist Guide right here in my hand.
[00:02:10.086 --> 00:02:11.686]  This was published by the DOJ.
[00:02:11.706 --> 00:02:20.109]  And it says to look out for American citizens who are members of the Patriot Movement.
[00:02:21.206 --> 00:02:34.236]  This is a training manual that's titled, Investigating Terrorism and Criminal Extremism, published by the DOJ, complete with terms and concepts to help recognize potential extremists.
[00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:37.939]  I'm going to read some of their bullet points, and you're not going to believe this.
[00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.602]  This is what they consider to be extremist speech.
[00:02:42.182 --> 00:02:53.332]  Anyone who talks about black helicopters, well they're obviously prone to conspiracy theory beliefs and they should be monitored and considered a threat according to the DOJ.
[00:02:53.833 --> 00:02:59.718]  If you talk about the Bilderberg Group or the Trilateral Commission or the CFR, you are a threat.
[00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.481]  Anyone who talks about the Illuminati
[00:03:02.941 --> 00:03:03.922]  Or the New World Order?
[00:03:04.222 --> 00:03:05.002]  Well, you're a threat.
[00:03:05.402 --> 00:03:13.966]  And if you stockpile food, water, and weapons, you might be an extremist, according to the United States Department of Justice.
[00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:30.634]  My other question is, since this happened on December 7th, and Infowars didn't reach out until December 12th at 9.39 PM, why didn't they bother to try to take a chance and contact the Sheriff's Office
[00:03:31.556 --> 00:03:32.757]  Let's go to John in Washington.
[00:03:33.237 --> 00:03:33.698]  Go ahead, John.
[00:03:33.718 --> 00:03:33.958]  Hello, guys.
[00:03:33.978 --> 00:03:37.100]  This is a fellow who lived in Spokane, Washington.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.544]  I operated a large informational website in Spokane, and I lived there, and it got so bad
[00:04:00.252 --> 00:04:03.314]  With surveillance and harassment that I moved to a neighboring County.
[00:04:03.334 --> 00:04:23.748]  I live about 14 miles off the paved road and Twice out here in recent history I have seen Bearcats on the dirt road right at sundown patrolling and they were not the same model they were two different ones I was in an adjacent County and
[00:04:24.938 --> 00:04:44.917]  Minding my own business, 10-45 one night in the year 2005, and on a telephone call from Spokane County to Stevens County, the Stevens County Sheriff, who was Craig Thayer, picked me up at my home, transported me across county lines, turned me over to the Spokane County Sheriff's Department,
[00:04:45.257 --> 00:04:53.188]  Who gulagged me for over a week without getting to see a magistrate with absolutely no telephone call whatsoever.
[00:04:53.609 --> 00:05:02.601]  I lost $36,000 in construction contracts because of it and nobody knew where I was and my dogs were locked in the house with no food.
[00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:18.825]  So, I can tell you for a fact that Spokane County not only handles Spokane County like a commissar, they actually dictate to Stephens County, Ponderay County, Ferry County, all of the adjacent counties, Lincoln County,
[00:05:19.205 --> 00:05:22.728]  Whatever Spokane says, they will do it.
[00:05:23.108 --> 00:05:27.611]  Spokane's Mayor David Condon released more details on his police action plan this morning.
[00:05:27.651 --> 00:05:28.051]  Take a look.
[00:05:28.392 --> 00:05:32.435]  It includes having officers connect with communities by attending neighborhood council meetings.
[00:05:32.815 --> 00:05:39.039]  Officers will also receive specialized training to help them deal with vulnerable populations like the mentally ill.
[00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.682]  And Condon wants to enhance civilian oversight of the police department.
[00:05:42.822 --> 00:05:53.552]  All of these changes coming from recommendations out of the use of force commission and those do include those body cameras in which all Spokane police officers will be wearing one of those by the end of the year.
[00:05:54.052 --> 00:06:01.979]  And all of these changes of course sparked by cases like AutoZem in which a former Spokane police officer was sent to prison for using excessive force.
[00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:03.960]  This is video of Sergeant Pete Bunch from 2005.
[00:06:05.341 --> 00:06:11.504]  Last Friday, Bunch was reportedly walking a couple blocks from his South Hill home when a neighbor called police thinking it was a prowler.
[00:06:12.064 --> 00:06:15.006]  She'd watched him walk through her backyard and her neighbor's yards.
[00:06:15.526 --> 00:06:21.309]  Court documents say the first officer on scene stopped Bunch in the street, but Bunch wouldn't look at him and appeared to be in a daze.
[00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:27.272]  Police say Bunch was uncooperative and wouldn't answer questions, but he did say he was looking for his lost dog.
[00:06:27.532 --> 00:06:30.315]  Is obstructing and resisting a fence that can get a sheriff's deputy fired?
[00:06:31.276 --> 00:06:33.519]  Depends on the act.
[00:06:33.739 --> 00:06:37.183]  It's not one of those that is good for your career, I can tell you this.
[00:06:37.364 --> 00:06:40.647]  I can tell you that we have suffered a terrible tragedy this last night.
[00:06:41.548 --> 00:06:47.075]  11 o'clock, my father got out of his bed responding to what he thought was a burglar.
[00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:55.077]  And took a gun with him, challenged that vehicle in his parking lot there in front of the plant farm.
[00:06:56.178 --> 00:06:59.922]  Subsequently, a deputy sheriff shot him and killed him.
[00:07:00.763 --> 00:07:05.187]  We're told Jacobs wanted to turn himself in after a night of drinking on a child support warrant.
[00:07:05.862 --> 00:07:09.443]  Three deputies showed up at their door around 5.40 Saturday morning.
[00:07:09.503 --> 00:07:10.543]  The police knocked on the door.
[00:07:10.623 --> 00:07:11.264]  I opened it.
[00:07:11.324 --> 00:07:12.984]  They asked if he was there.
[00:07:13.044 --> 00:07:13.924]  I moved out of the way.
[00:07:13.964 --> 00:07:14.605]  They come in.
[00:07:14.945 --> 00:07:16.365]  They said, there's a knife, there's a knife.
[00:07:16.505 --> 00:07:18.726]  We're told one deputy shot and killed Jacobs.
[00:07:18.926 --> 00:07:23.227]  He had a knife that was in a big thick case that was in the chair behind him.
[00:07:23.407 --> 00:07:26.128]  Next thing I know, the cops kicked in the door.
[00:07:26.148 --> 00:07:28.569]  I stepped back.
[00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:32.110]  Kenny reached for the knife.
[00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:34.120]  And they shot him.
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:44.066]  In the end, the Department of Justice will issue recommendations, and if they aren't followed, the Spokane Police Department would risk stricter oversight by the DOJ.
[00:07:44.306 --> 00:07:48.249]  Apparently, it wasn't that hot of a story if they waited a week.
[00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:57.615]  Infowars and Alex Jones, in my opinion, this is standard operation procedure.
[00:07:58.375 --> 00:08:02.018]  They only give you what fits their agenda.
[00:08:02.495 --> 00:08:07.257]  That conspiracy theory comes from the mother of all conspiracy theories that seduce Republicans.
[00:08:07.877 --> 00:08:10.398]  It's an internet talk show called Info Wars.
[00:08:10.978 --> 00:08:18.261]  How on earth does that kind of rhetoric to the American people serve any kind of sensible, rational purpose?
[00:08:19.051 --> 00:08:37.075]  Alex Jones may sound crazy, but still has 300 million YouTube... well, he has 300 million people that have watched him on YouTube, and that sort of fringe, arch-conservative, deeply, I think, racist strain is being tapped into at crazy profit by people in the media.
[00:08:37.275 --> 00:08:42.596]  We're getting the big stories wrong over and over again.
[00:08:42.616 --> 00:08:46.117]  If you take a look at their site right now,
[00:08:48.629 --> 00:08:54.631]  You will find death threats towards his deputy that remain on that website.
[00:08:56.071 --> 00:08:59.212]  In my opinion, that is unconscionable.
[00:08:59.792 --> 00:09:05.774]  Challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally, and pop him!
[00:09:05.994 --> 00:09:06.694]  I'd love to see that!
[00:09:07.414 --> 00:09:08.094]  In uniform!
[00:09:10.555 --> 00:09:17.477]  Especially when this deputy has 20 years of law enforcement service, has a Medal of Valor,
[00:09:18.399 --> 00:09:21.223]  And has served his nation in the United States military.
[00:09:22.064 --> 00:09:23.626]  He has taken the oath of office.
[00:09:24.307 --> 00:09:26.811]  He has sworn to protect and uphold the constitution.
[00:09:27.792 --> 00:09:33.700]  It is sad and regrettable that he chose his words poorly.
[00:09:34.727 --> 00:09:37.069]  Because he used broad brush strokes.
[00:09:37.649 --> 00:09:41.513]  If you ask people, many people call me a constitutionalist.
[00:09:41.533 --> 00:09:42.794]  I wear that title with honor.
[00:09:42.834 --> 00:09:45.356]  Because I do firmly believe in the Constitution of the United States.
[00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:46.637]  If you take a look at the facts,
[00:10:04.528 --> 00:10:17.040]  Washington law enforcement has done more to protect the rights, especially the gun rights, of its citizens than many of these groups that are decrying the deputy's comments.
[00:10:19.222 --> 00:10:24.386]  We have worked against the Washington version of the Brady Bill.
[00:10:25.567 --> 00:10:29.151]  I myself and law enforcement in the state of Washington in 2014
[00:10:31.556 --> 00:10:47.164]  Stepped out against I-594, which in my opinion was a very broad brush law that is unenforceable and has issues that affected gun rights.
[00:10:49.105 --> 00:11:00.091]  We have also taken the time to ensure, I personally ensured that in our counties emergency operation plan.
[00:11:01.471 --> 00:11:12.794]  That it reads that no law-abiding citizen will ever have their gun rights or their guns taken from them during a declared emergency.
[00:11:14.654 --> 00:11:24.416]  Again, Washington law enforcement has done more to protect the second amendment and stand for the constitution than many of these groups.
[00:11:24.937 --> 00:11:30.998]  And it is sad that representative Matt Shea has taken these tacks of attacking
[00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:34.401]  His own law enforcement agency, multiple times now.
[00:11:35.916 --> 00:11:37.237]  Why do you need bayonets?
[00:11:37.477 --> 00:11:39.759]  Why do local law enforcement need bayonets?
[00:11:39.779 --> 00:11:42.321]  Give me one instance where they could use those things.
[00:11:42.701 --> 00:11:47.625]  And I think that that's what this particular individual, when they interviewed the deputy, was asking the same question.
[00:11:48.005 --> 00:11:51.808]  And the question has to be answered by him, not by the public.
[00:11:52.149 --> 00:12:04.038]  He's the one that has to defend why he's against being a constitutionalist, being against somebody that loves the rule of law, that loves the Constitution, being against somebody that believes that the Constitution means what it says.
[00:12:04.098 --> 00:12:05.419]  He's got to defend that in his
[00:12:05.859 --> 00:12:10.060]  I didn't hear Matt decry the fact that people that carried the banner that we all support of our constitutional rights
[00:12:34.861 --> 00:12:43.527]  When these people purposely went out and killed police officers.
[00:12:44.347 --> 00:12:52.312]  Whether this is staged, and boy there's a lot of evidence it is, or whether this is just organic mind control of the sick culture.
[00:12:54.033 --> 00:13:00.478]  People that feel so empty and poor and pathetic that they want power, so they imagine they're comic book villains and go out and kill police.
[00:13:01.653 --> 00:13:08.537]  Probably a hundred times the last six months I have said that you're going to start seeing police officers getting shot in public.
[00:13:10.678 --> 00:13:14.000]  And it's going to be blamed on the Tea Party and quote super patriots.
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:19.723]  Because it's in the dramas, it's in the sitcoms, it's in the movies, it's in the comic books.
[00:13:20.663 --> 00:13:24.085]  And whether it's staged black op false flags,
[00:13:25.478 --> 00:13:29.401]  In Las Vegas, after the Bundy incident, to those people that went down to support Bundy,
[00:13:45.376 --> 00:13:50.360]  Killed two Las Vegas police officers and draped their bodies in the Gadsden flag.
[00:13:51.241 --> 00:13:56.225]  I did not hear Representative Ducey decry the death of those officers.
[00:13:57.646 --> 00:14:14.420]  And quite frankly, as constitutional loving citizens, we all should have decried the heinous acts committed by some that claim to hold our beliefs because they truly do not hold our beliefs.
[00:14:15.339 --> 00:14:18.284]  Deport British citizen Piers Morgan for attacking Second Amendment.
[00:14:18.865 --> 00:14:19.666]  Take a look.
[00:14:19.686 --> 00:14:22.110]  More than 104,000 people have signed it so far.
[00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.074]  Joining me now is one of the people behind the petition, Alex Jones.
[00:14:25.094 --> 00:14:27.118]  He's host of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:14:27.138 --> 00:14:28.039]  Hitler took the guns.
[00:14:28.299 --> 00:14:29.341]  Stalin took the guns.
[00:14:29.621 --> 00:14:30.483]  Mao took the guns.
[00:14:30.663 --> 00:14:32.564]  That is the biggest problem we have in America today.
[00:14:58.726 --> 00:15:04.987]  Is that we have people that preach fear and hatred.
[00:15:05.407 --> 00:15:10.548]  And what we need to do is change the way in which people think about guns, especially young people.
[00:15:10.688 --> 00:15:16.429]  One thing that I think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive about this.
[00:15:16.489 --> 00:15:21.110]  It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday.
[00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:28.031]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:15:28.391 --> 00:15:42.307]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it.
[00:15:43.268 --> 00:15:43.528]  I think?
[00:16:15.548 --> 00:16:23.670]  This is nothing more than a continuation of that preaching of fear and hatred against law enforcement and the government.
[00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:39.893]  Our whole society has become polarized and it is a shame that we allow these hate mongers and these fear mongers to control the day.
[00:16:40.444 --> 00:16:45.628]  And CNN, Time Magazine, MSNBC saying, hey, it's good to riot, it's legitimate.
[00:16:46.789 --> 00:16:48.970]  Louis Farrakhan and others saying, yeah, go ahead and target whites.
[00:16:50.231 --> 00:16:50.871]  That's crazy.
[00:16:53.233 --> 00:16:58.797]  You like the Bosnian guy who I guarantee has no connection to slavery in this country?
[00:16:59.558 --> 00:17:01.679]  Barely speaks English, getting his head clubbed in by hammers?
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.502]  I mean, by black folks?
[00:17:05.602 --> 00:17:06.843]  I mean, really, Farrakhan?
[00:17:07.745 --> 00:17:08.045]  Really?
[00:17:08.065 --> 00:17:10.186]  He deserved to have his head clubbed in?
[00:17:10.646 --> 00:17:17.548]  It violates my belief in what America can be.
[00:17:17.568 --> 00:17:28.172]  To hear young people feeling marginalized and distrustful even after they've done everything right.
[00:17:28.532 --> 00:17:29.252]  That's not who we are.
[00:17:30.773 --> 00:17:34.174]  That is President Obama in a press conference yesterday.
[00:17:35.908 --> 00:17:53.034]  I was monitoring all the major morning shows on cable and broadcast TV this morning, NBC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC, 100% hyping and race baiting where the only issue in America is black versus white.
[00:17:56.189 --> 00:17:57.810]  And the people versus the police.
[00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:25.425]  No discussion of the banking complex, the military industrial complex, the legal law firm complex, and accounting firm complex that is tax-free above the law, that has publicly militarized and globalized and federalized our police, and are the authors of the vicious police tactics and policies that have been put forward.
[00:18:26.394 --> 00:18:32.719]  They're installing the same tactics in Europe, in Australia, in the United States, in Canada.
[00:18:34.801 --> 00:18:37.423]  Someone questions the police so they choke them to death.
[00:18:38.925 --> 00:18:42.728]  In the case up in New York where riots are promised if the cops aren't indicted.
[00:18:43.529 --> 00:18:46.111]  And in that case, I mean, they really do killing.
[00:18:47.145 --> 00:18:47.785]  They really do.
[00:18:47.925 --> 00:18:48.345]  Grab him.
[00:18:49.146 --> 00:18:50.086]  He's not resisting him.
[00:18:50.106 --> 00:18:51.067]  He's just talking to him.
[00:18:51.627 --> 00:18:55.008]  And four white cops kill him deader than a hammer.
[00:18:55.648 --> 00:19:02.391]  I am asking every citizen of Spokane County to step up and say no more.
[00:19:03.491 --> 00:19:09.334]  No more demonizing the very people that have sworn to protect you.
[00:19:10.434 --> 00:19:12.135]  Because of three seconds
[00:19:13.436 --> 00:19:19.158]  A video and three seconds of something taken out of context.
[00:19:20.919 --> 00:19:23.720]  That deputy is a very great individual.
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:29.382]  He serves the community well, and I will be having a discussion with him about his choice of words.
[00:19:30.222 --> 00:19:36.344]  But let me leave no doubt in your minds that we are constitutionally based.
[00:19:37.364 --> 00:19:38.765]  We enforce the constitution.
[00:19:39.767 --> 00:19:47.493]  And at no time will that piece of equipment be used to take your constitutional rights away, but it will be used to save your lives.
[00:19:48.274 --> 00:19:49.415]  And that's why we have it.
[00:19:50.015 --> 00:19:54.979]  We have threats from around the world that we deal with on a daily basis.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.483]  We have threats of people going into our schools and shooting our children.
[00:20:00.443 --> 00:20:03.346]  We have threats of people putting bombs on our streets.
[00:20:04.966 --> 00:20:07.208]  We have the equipment to deal with those threats.
[00:20:08.148 --> 00:20:16.514]  And that equipment is there to save your lives and to protect the lives of the men and women that ride in them to come and rescue you.
[00:20:17.835 --> 00:20:19.236]  This is Sheriff Ozzie Knezovich.
[00:20:19.496 --> 00:20:25.260]  I hope I have made it very clear that I am appalled by the misinformation
[00:20:26.636 --> 00:20:34.382]  Put out by InfoWars without the opportunity to address three seconds of comment.
[00:20:35.083 --> 00:20:36.884]  Where's the rest of the tape?
[00:20:37.905 --> 00:20:39.446]  Where's the rest of the interview?
[00:20:40.227 --> 00:20:50.835]  Where's the tape showing the individual that taped this saying that we were trying to use this as propaganda?
[00:20:51.716 --> 00:20:55.499]  This piece of equipment to desensitize children towards it.
[00:20:56.277 --> 00:20:56.878]  Where is that?
[00:20:58.679 --> 00:21:03.323]  If you really want to have the debate, I will be more than happy to debate anybody on this issue.
[00:21:04.324 --> 00:21:09.689]  I will be more than happy to look Alex Jones in the eyes and tell him my opinions.
[00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:13.372]  And I am more than willing to debate
[00:21:14.221 --> 00:21:17.403]  Representative Matt Shea at any time on these issues.
[00:21:18.023 --> 00:21:29.230]  I think that anytime we have somebody that is saying innocent citizens that have done nothing else other than love the Constitution are somehow the enemy, we don't live in a free country anymore.
[00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:32.972]  And when that is allowed to stand, then tyranny gets a foothold.
[00:21:33.032 --> 00:21:43.258]  And I think that that's one of the reasons there's been such this great public outcry here in Spokane Valley, Washington, why there's going to be a protest in front of the sheriff's office this weekend, and why
[00:21:43.678 --> 00:22:01.294]  He needs to take action to do, I think, the right thing, which would be to apologize to the citizens, do some remedial constitutional rights classes, establish a citizen board to oversee the deployment of that MRAP, or even better yet, get rid of it and send it back, and also to meet with the people.
[00:22:01.594 --> 00:22:01.794]  He's a
[00:22:01.834 --> 00:22:06.296]  Even today, there is little value in ensuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it.
[00:22:06.396 --> 00:22:10.918]  And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security
[00:22:30.967 --> 00:22:38.617]  Will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment.
[00:22:39.598 --> 00:22:43.282]  That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it's in my control.
[00:22:53.891 --> 00:23:01.757]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding and making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:23:02.017 --> 00:23:04.078]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:23:04.238 --> 00:23:06.880]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:11.043]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:23:11.283 --> 00:23:14.526]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:23:14.546 --> 00:23:21.811]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:23:21.991 --> 00:23:26.112]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:23:26.292 --> 00:23:27.953]  We are the true media.
[00:23:28.093 --> 00:23:30.714]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:23:30.814 --> 00:23:34.455]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
