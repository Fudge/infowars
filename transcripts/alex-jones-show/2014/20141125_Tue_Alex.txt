[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.333]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.693]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:21.154]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.935 --> 00:00:22.815]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.476 --> 00:00:27.099]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.723]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:48.888 --> 00:01:17.658]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, last night, I sat there in the comfort of my home, the safety of my home, and could not go to sleep until the wee hours watching Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs in Ferguson, Missouri, with gunshots going off all around them, as criminals, quite frankly, I mean, it is terrorism, tried to shoot the police.
[00:01:21.094 --> 00:01:27.517]  And, you know, Dew told them you can pull out of there if you want, but they basically wanted to stay in the middle of the fray.
[00:01:27.557 --> 00:01:35.319]  But I think both Jakari and Joe Biggs will get the biggest bonuses anybody's ever gotten around here for going and doing that.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.060]  It's all over the news.
[00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:42.822]  See, we see ourselves subconsciously as alternative media still.
[00:01:43.362 --> 00:01:44.403]  I don't, but my crew does.
[00:01:45.581 --> 00:01:56.304]  And so whenever cops are hiding, protesters are running, people are shooting at the police, bullets are bouncing off their armored vehicles, Joe Biggs is saying, why is everybody running?
[00:01:56.364 --> 00:01:57.064]  Oh, they're shooting.
[00:01:57.664 --> 00:02:03.266]  It's national news that MSNBC anchor chased off the air by gunfire.
[00:02:03.806 --> 00:02:05.227]  It's national news.
[00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:08.267]  Fires burning in Ferguson and gunshots.
[00:02:08.788 --> 00:02:13.349]  And there are Joe Biggs and Jakari in the middle of the gunfire, not running.
[00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:17.588]  And no one in my operation sees that as even a big deal.
[00:02:19.568 --> 00:02:20.149]  Think about that.
[00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:21.729]  National news.
[00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:28.211]  And again, this is just how the media works, and this is a microcosm of everybody else in this country.
[00:02:28.491 --> 00:02:31.232]  We see government as invincible, government as God.
[00:02:31.892 --> 00:02:34.693]  It doesn't matter if we have millions of listeners, four or five million a day.
[00:02:34.713 --> 00:02:38.233]  It doesn't matter if a million plus people visit Infowars.com a day.
[00:02:38.814 --> 00:02:43.415]  We still think of ourselves as small.
[00:02:44.932 --> 00:02:50.074]  We still think of MSNBC with 200,000 viewers at one time as bigger than us.
[00:02:52.275 --> 00:02:53.655]  And I'm not criticizing anybody.
[00:02:55.416 --> 00:02:59.017]  I almost picked the phone up last night to say, hey, go with this headline, go with that headline.
[00:03:00.537 --> 00:03:01.298]  This is epic.
[00:03:01.438 --> 00:03:02.778]  You're in the middle of gunfire.
[00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:05.439]  This is definitely racially based.
[00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.620]  People are burning down Mexican food restaurants and looting them.
[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.781]  You have the footage.
[00:03:09.921 --> 00:03:12.982]  How incredibly brave Jakari and Joe Biggs are.
[00:03:13.002 --> 00:03:13.562]  And I thought, no.
[00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.810]  They'll understand how epic this is, and then it'll be told.
[00:03:19.551 --> 00:03:20.411]  And then it really wasn't.
[00:03:21.072 --> 00:03:27.795]  And again, I'm gonna get into the whole Ferguson situation, but our response to it is a microcosm.
[00:03:28.236 --> 00:03:32.038]  I went to Infowars.com this morning at 6 a.m.
[00:03:32.058 --> 00:03:45.425]  when I got up, and we were reporting on the CNN people running and the MSNBC running, not on what we saw and how we stayed and how we have six hours videos of all of it happening right there.
[00:03:48.985 --> 00:03:53.926]  You know, live, historic, uncensored, what really went on, true journalism.
[00:03:54.686 --> 00:03:57.707]  Instead, look at CNN.
[00:03:59.587 --> 00:03:59.928]  They ran.
[00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:05.489]  Because that's what the heroes do, is they run while our reporters stand there in the middle of the gunfire.
[00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:08.210]  Now, I'm done ranting about that.
[00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.330]  I'm just talking about how we need to get our minds around this as a people.
[00:04:12.691 --> 00:04:14.211]  The Federal Reserve isn't federal.
[00:04:14.251 --> 00:04:18.232]  It isn't the big stone buildings that are invincible that look like some Olympian god base.
[00:04:19.198 --> 00:04:23.442]  It's a bunch of foreign criminal bankers that hoodwinked and swindled their way into control of the nation.
[00:04:25.363 --> 00:04:25.563]  See?
[00:04:29.406 --> 00:04:29.927]  Understand that?
[00:04:30.647 --> 00:04:32.229]  But saying, oh, it's a big stone building.
[00:04:32.549 --> 00:04:33.390]  It's the establishment.
[00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.311]  Oh, it's got the power.
[00:04:35.331 --> 00:04:39.735]  These criminals count on this allure of grandeur and invincibility.
[00:04:40.595 --> 00:04:44.439]  Now listen, when I come back, I'm going to refocus and get into what actually happened last night.
[00:04:44.679 --> 00:04:47.081]  This is a Rosetta Stone issue you can see into everything on.
[00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:53.951]  Clearly they announced the verdict at night, as a sigh of, trying to make this as bad as possible.
[00:04:53.971 --> 00:04:54.792]  I kept saying that for weeks.
[00:04:55.192 --> 00:05:02.676]  If they announced it right after nightfall, so they announced it one in the morning, it wouldn't have been a video, everybody would have gone to bed.
[00:05:02.776 --> 00:05:07.618]  Maximum effect, two hours after dark, they did it with perfect precision.
[00:05:09.352 --> 00:05:15.595]  When I first got online and I seen the price of the X2 and the DNA Force, I was a little hesitant, but I pulled the trigger on it.
[00:05:15.735 --> 00:05:16.715]  It has changed my life.
[00:05:16.735 --> 00:05:18.816]  I've been taking it for about 24 days now.
[00:05:18.916 --> 00:05:20.277]  Counting the weights, staying in shape.

[00:06:43.213 --> 00:06:47.194]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:06:47.494 --> 00:06:48.955]  Can you put two and two together?

[00:08:32.025 --> 00:08:34.628]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:39.355 --> 00:08:48.624]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live, worldwide, Tuesday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:48.884 --> 00:09:01.776]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to be here for the next three hours covering the aftermath of the Ferguson situation that may continue and will probably continue to erupt tonight right through Thanksgiving.
[00:09:03.038 --> 00:09:21.289]  Now, when you've got ISIS, aka Al-Qaeda, killing around 300,000 people the last four years in Syria, and you've got 15 million children starving to death a year, another 20 million adults, you've got 14 million people dying of malaria every year, I mean, I get it, there are a lot bigger real issues in the world.
[00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:28.334]  But as far as a media event and a PSYOP, and to study social engineering,
[00:09:29.184 --> 00:09:41.275]  And to study anthropology and sociology, the things the globalists scientifically study on record, you can see how Ferguson is a beta test for things much larger.
[00:09:41.835 --> 00:09:45.378]  I said six years ago that Obama was going to stir up race war in America.
[00:09:46.619 --> 00:09:51.444]  I'm on record saying it, let's not exaggerate, probably three or four thousand times.
[00:09:52.705 --> 00:09:53.866]  I said a couple times a week.
[00:09:54.586 --> 00:09:54.987]  You do that,
[00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:59.131]  That's at least 300, 400, 500, maybe a thousand times.
[00:09:59.231 --> 00:09:59.531]  I don't know.
[00:10:00.172 --> 00:10:01.432]  Conservatively, 500 times.
[00:10:01.552 --> 00:10:01.993]  I don't know.
[00:10:02.313 --> 00:10:04.454]  You've probably heard me say it so much you're sick of hearing it.
[00:10:04.894 --> 00:10:13.999]  Now, I'm not a rocket scientist, but I do study anthropology, social engineering, sociology, and you can clearly see
[00:10:15.538 --> 00:10:28.566]  Where the system is trying to exacerbate racial, religious, ethnic, sexual differences and play us off against each other while doing it in the name of multiculturalism.
[00:10:29.347 --> 00:10:30.508]  It's divide and conquer.
[00:10:31.288 --> 00:10:35.351]  It's how the British could have a thousand troops and control the country of India.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.523]  Back when they first took it over hundreds of years ago, was by playing different groups off against each other.
[00:10:41.784 --> 00:10:56.875]  They would send in advanced squads to live there for decades and learn every little division, every little religious or ethnic beef between the Hatfields and the McCoys in that area, and then come in and exacerbate it.
[00:10:57.676 --> 00:11:04.401]  Now caught in the middle are the citizens of Missouri, the citizens of Ferguson, the citizens of America, the police,
[00:11:05.762 --> 00:11:06.703]  The shopkeepers.
[00:11:07.963 --> 00:11:12.586]  And so you've got bad players here on both sides, but it's not the rank-and-file demonstrators.
[00:11:12.606 --> 00:11:14.507]  It's not the rank-and-file police officers.
[00:11:14.867 --> 00:11:17.729]  The rank-and-file police officers are just in there trying to do their job.
[00:11:18.009 --> 00:11:19.810]  They got shot at last night.
[00:11:20.111 --> 00:11:20.711]  A whole bunch.
[00:11:21.511 --> 00:11:27.815]  And Joe Biggs and Jakari Jackson, who I don't know whether I should reprimand them or give them the biggest bonus I've ever given a reporter.
[00:11:28.215 --> 00:11:29.476]  It's going to be the big bonus end.
[00:11:30.217 --> 00:11:31.738]  But not next time.
[00:11:32.913 --> 00:11:37.336]  I told them, if the shooting starts, you're to pull all the way to the back and get in cover.
[00:11:38.697 --> 00:11:39.657]  Well, they didn't do that.
[00:11:40.318 --> 00:11:43.360]  Joe Biggs really didn't, and just stood right up there.
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.082]  And we've got video and audio of it going up on InfoWars.com.
[00:11:47.102 --> 00:11:51.145]  There's lower res, live streams of it, up on InfoWars.com as well.
[00:11:52.045 --> 00:12:00.191]  But it just goes to the fact that they were so in to getting the story, as I guess media jaegers, or hunters.
[00:12:01.258 --> 00:12:08.163]  That they didn't hide when the firefighters ran, the police ran, the protesters ran, as criminals.
[00:12:09.904 --> 00:12:11.105]  That's not a strong enough word.
[00:12:11.165 --> 00:12:13.546]  I mean, military attackers.
[00:12:14.267 --> 00:12:15.087]  It is terrorism.
[00:12:15.788 --> 00:12:17.028]  We're shooting at the police.
[00:12:17.109 --> 00:12:17.909]  Now, here's the problem.
[00:12:18.549 --> 00:12:21.571]  Our government's so corrupt, it could have been a federal agency doing that.
[00:12:22.032 --> 00:12:25.594]  Our government shipped guns to Mexico to blame the Second Amendment and got caught in Fast and Furious.
[00:12:26.094 --> 00:12:27.696]  They staged a bunch of other provocative events.
[00:12:27.916 --> 00:12:29.457]  They allow radical Islamists to stand.
[00:12:30.546 --> 00:12:32.206]  And allow him to set up training camps in the U.S.
[00:12:32.506 --> 00:12:35.487]  So, I don't know if it was provocateur.
[00:12:35.587 --> 00:12:36.487]  Probably not!
[00:12:36.827 --> 00:12:46.870]  There's so much hatred and anger stirred up by MSNBC and CNN and the White House and the Justice Department that there were probably real thugs out there shooting at the police.
[00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.630]  We'll get Chakari Jackson and Joe Biggs' take on this.
[00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:53.771]  But, I will tell them tonight, I don't want to tempt fate.
[00:12:53.851 --> 00:12:54.811]  They want to stay and keep reporting.
[00:12:54.831 --> 00:12:55.231]  That's great.
[00:12:56.112 --> 00:12:57.732]  They are not to be at the front.
[00:12:59.121 --> 00:13:01.061]  Of course, sometimes you're safer at the front than the back.
[00:13:01.862 --> 00:13:04.702]  But I don't want my reporters getting shot.
[00:13:05.802 --> 00:13:08.003]  And the police are the right thing, hiding behind their vehicles.
[00:13:08.723 --> 00:13:10.263]  But see, this will turn into the whole argument.
[00:13:10.303 --> 00:13:11.324]  See, we need armored vehicles.
[00:13:11.344 --> 00:13:12.064]  We got shot at.
[00:13:12.664 --> 00:13:14.084]  Right as the MRAPs get deployed.
[00:13:14.104 --> 00:13:16.245]  Remember a year ago, they did martial law training.
[00:13:16.605 --> 00:13:19.065]  Actually, two years ago, in areas of St.
[00:13:19.105 --> 00:13:19.405]  Louis.
[00:13:20.626 --> 00:13:21.806]  And said, oh, it's for what's coming.
[00:13:23.373 --> 00:13:28.057]  There is a PSYOP going on, and I said this last week, over and over again, on record.
[00:13:28.097 --> 00:13:32.721]  I said, if they announce this... In fact, Jakari was on with me last Wednesday.
[00:13:33.942 --> 00:13:37.845]  And I said, I think if it's provocateur, they'll announce it about two hours after dark.
[00:13:39.467 --> 00:13:40.588]  And Jakari said, I agree with you.
[00:13:41.553 --> 00:13:46.376]  If it isn't provocateur, you announce it in the early morning, like 5 a.m., 6 a.m.
[00:13:46.416 --> 00:13:47.157]  It dribbles out.
[00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:48.658]  People don't organize.
[00:13:48.918 --> 00:13:55.963]  The type of thugs that get on social networks to do this and use the demonstrations as cover to loot and rob, they're asleep till noon.
[00:13:57.024 --> 00:13:59.185]  You announce it in the morning.
[00:14:01.927 --> 00:14:02.988]  I say 4 or 5 a.m.
[00:14:03.929 --> 00:14:05.710]  You announce it two hours after dark.
[00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:09.592]  Everybody just started getting into the beer, getting into the liquor.
[00:14:10.566 --> 00:14:19.150]  You are guaranteeing, and the governor and everybody coming out for hours and hyping it from like four on, like, okay, just be calm, it's coming, just be calm.
[00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:21.451]  They're social engineers, folks.
[00:14:21.691 --> 00:14:23.972]  They're being given federal orders on all this.
[00:14:24.352 --> 00:14:25.653]  They know what they're doing.
[00:14:27.964 --> 00:14:37.050]  So the citizens, the police, and everybody else were put in the middle of this for federal PSYOPs, federalization of police, armored vehicles, continued militarization.
[00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:37.810]  That's bottom line.
[00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:49.917]  Just like in 1991-92 when they stood down in Los Angeles and let the rioting get going, Daryl Gates, formerly CIA on record, that was all a PSYOP to further militarize police and say, see, we need more funds.
[00:14:50.418 --> 00:14:52.019]  Does the average cop know this is happening?
[00:14:52.059 --> 00:14:52.179]  No.
[00:14:53.066 --> 00:14:57.771]  Just like the Seattle riots were provocateured, that came out in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and Seattle Times.
[00:14:58.231 --> 00:15:01.414]  Esquire didn't believe me when they did a profile last year.
[00:15:02.175 --> 00:15:02.555]  Look it up.
[00:15:03.697 --> 00:15:15.949]  They did a profile last year, big cover profile, and he said Delta Force was not at the Seattle riots running it.
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:21.224]  And he went and looked it up, and then saw interviews with the police chief, and where they all admitted they ran it.
[00:15:21.524 --> 00:15:31.354]  Guess who Joe Biggs, who worked aside special forces units in Afghanistan and Iraq, guess who he saw there and got photos and videos of, and we can show that?
[00:15:31.695 --> 00:15:32.395]  Delta Force.
[00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:36.580]  Clearly, Delta Force and then support units.
[00:15:38.826 --> 00:15:40.887]  Guys that have been medically retired who then support them.
[00:15:41.408 --> 00:15:48.533]  He saw spec ops operators, Delta Force, who he worked alongside in Iraq and Afghanistan, especially Afghanistan.
[00:15:49.253 --> 00:15:50.834]  He would like bring people to them and stuff.
[00:15:51.615 --> 00:15:52.476]  That's who he saw there.
[00:15:53.076 --> 00:16:00.741]  So I'm telling you folks, Delta Force works directly for the president and was at Waco and were the ones that torched the building and shot the people.
[00:16:00.761 --> 00:16:02.923]  We have the flare footage later came out in Congress.
[00:16:03.303 --> 00:16:04.424]  Yeah, that stuff all came out.
[00:16:06.752 --> 00:16:10.033]  Just like CIA drug dealing came out in Congress, but nobody ever talks about that.
[00:16:14.375 --> 00:16:16.416]  And they were at the WTO again.
[00:16:16.996 --> 00:16:23.138]  The fact that you bring Delta Force into this, when they operate domestically, it's dirty.
[00:16:23.719 --> 00:16:32.382]  We had Delta Force, myself and Mike Hanson in San Antonio, at gunpoint, take away our footage of them when we were down there showing their drills.
[00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:41.333]  To be clear, they had a MP take it away from us at gunpoint, while they sat there videotaping us.
[00:16:42.113 --> 00:16:46.535]  So, you need to understand, ladies and gentlemen, that's real reporting that Joe Biggs and Sha'Carri Jackson have gotten.
[00:16:46.975 --> 00:16:52.778]  So, you've got horrible thug life, thug culture garbage that's promoted through the media and hip-hop and the rest of it.
[00:16:52.798 --> 00:16:59.121]  We have a special Rick Ross interview coming up that we're going to premiere here today, where he exposes the pipeline from hip-hop to prison.
[00:16:59.801 --> 00:17:00.764]  We're trying to stop this.
[00:17:01.165 --> 00:17:02.710]  That's wrong, that's terrible, that's horrible.
[00:17:03.292 --> 00:17:05.217]  Shooting the police is just terrible.
[00:17:07.523 --> 00:17:11.106]  But at the same time, it's terrible they announced it at night, and who can deny that?
[00:17:11.306 --> 00:17:14.508]  We're going to skip this network break, because the guys have not had any sleep yet.
[00:17:14.788 --> 00:17:19.371]  I want to get their report, let them get their stuff filed, and get some rest before tonight.
[00:17:19.992 --> 00:17:28.378]  And we'll have live streaming on InfoWars Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock Central on, with what undoubtedly will be more rioting, and they're worried that it can break out in other areas.
[00:17:28.438 --> 00:17:31.100]  Most of Ferguson, most of the businesses were burned down.
[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.241]  All sorts of racial stuff.
[00:17:33.642 --> 00:17:34.322]  Burn it down.
[00:17:34.642 --> 00:17:35.984]  If you're white, we're coming for you.
[00:17:36.644 --> 00:17:39.086]  Horrible as the globalists play us off against each other.
[00:17:39.406 --> 00:17:47.794]  Let's go to former Staff Sergeant veteran Joe Biggs, and that's important because he can militarily report on what he saw there and also seeing the special ops
[00:17:48.314 --> 00:17:52.758]  Uh, operators that he believes were probably with, with Delta Force, because that's who they use domestically.
[00:17:52.778 --> 00:17:56.841]  Uh, they had North Carolina plates, by the way, from Bragg, and that's where they're located.
[00:17:57.242 --> 00:18:00.224]  Joe Biggs, tell us overall what you saw, what you witnessed.
[00:18:00.244 --> 00:18:01.685]  I'm not trying to puff you up here.
[00:18:02.246 --> 00:18:03.887]  It's just you guys are so humble.
[00:18:04.248 --> 00:18:09.632]  If you'd have put out the report that you sat there in the gunfire when everybody else ran, and we have footage, that's national news.
[00:18:09.953 --> 00:18:13.576]  It's national news that CNN and MSNBC people ran.
[00:18:14.485 --> 00:18:16.306]  And they were way behind you guys cowering.
[00:18:16.726 --> 00:18:18.586]  So all I'm saying is great job.
[00:18:19.047 --> 00:18:23.948]  Really, I mean, people stand there when a hurricane comes in and it's national news, you know, guys blowing around.
[00:18:24.248 --> 00:18:27.189]  You're there in the right in the middle of it as eyewitnesses.
[00:18:27.249 --> 00:18:28.210]  That's newsworthy.
[00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:29.990]  So great job, Joe Biggs.
[00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:31.151]  Give us your feel.
[00:18:31.371 --> 00:18:34.752]  You just heard me from, you know, 500, 600 miles away.
[00:18:35.112 --> 00:18:36.833]  Give you my take sitting here in Austin.
[00:18:37.213 --> 00:18:39.213]  What is your take on what you saw and what I said?
[00:18:39.233 --> 00:18:44.095]  I mean, there's not a lot of words that can explain the actual
[00:18:45.134 --> 00:18:47.537]  The site in person of what happened here.
[00:18:47.557 --> 00:18:54.325]  And also, just to give you guys a background of where we are right now, I'm on West Florissant Avenue in Ferguson.
[00:18:54.741 --> 00:18:57.601]  And right behind me, this is the McDonald's over to my left.
[00:18:58.002 --> 00:19:03.582]  The windows were busted out everywhere in this area, but the building was not burned down.
[00:19:03.623 --> 00:19:05.423]  But this is a huge complex behind me.
[00:19:05.763 --> 00:19:08.803]  You can see all the way through this building to the other side.
[00:19:08.823 --> 00:19:10.524]  This is a very wide building.
[00:19:10.864 --> 00:19:12.004]  It was burned to the ground.
[00:19:12.304 --> 00:19:16.805]  The transformers in the area that feed power to the buildings exploded last night.
[00:19:16.845 --> 00:19:20.925]  We got some really good footage, and I took a picture just right at the right time.
[00:19:21.265 --> 00:19:24.206]  I mean, last night was complete and total chaos.
[00:19:24.904 --> 00:19:31.754]  I probably counted somewhere over a thousand rounds being fired on the other side of the police, I should say.
[00:19:31.774 --> 00:19:39.505]  It was one of the most heartbreaking things I saw last night, where the firefighters out here at the beginning of the night trying to put these fires out.
[00:19:39.895 --> 00:19:43.537]  And then being told they had to be pulled back because the fire truck was taking fire.
[00:19:43.857 --> 00:19:47.879]  They were shooting at the fire truck, and you could see the firefighters being pulled back.
[00:19:47.899 --> 00:19:48.620]  Yeah, I mean, exactly.
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.541]  Obama has whitewashed this.
[00:19:50.921 --> 00:20:00.126]  Because they couldn't do their job, and they wanted to save a business, and they weren't allowed to because there was these people out there firing at them, and they were just trying to save another business in the community.
[00:20:00.626 --> 00:20:02.288]  Well, Joe, that's a great example of whitewash.
[00:20:02.348 --> 00:20:03.910]  Obama says don't focus on the negative.
[00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:05.232]  This is happening.
[00:20:05.672 --> 00:20:07.034]  And people say, well, ignore Obama.
[00:20:07.074 --> 00:20:13.541]  Well, they said, you know, don't cover Ebola, so the media stopped covering it, even though we know they're covering up cases clearly here in the U.S.
[00:20:13.641 --> 00:20:17.846]  Only Drudge is picking up our stories where we show that there's a cover-up going on.
[00:20:19.848 --> 00:20:20.789]  So the sky's the limit.
[00:20:20.809 --> 00:20:22.291]  But yeah, there's the headline right there.
[00:20:22.671 --> 00:20:23.852]  Fire truck shot.
[00:20:25.413 --> 00:20:27.415]  Terrorist attempt to kill firefighters.
[00:20:28.216 --> 00:20:29.056]  I mean, here's the thing.
[00:20:29.397 --> 00:20:33.340]  I'm against police shooting reporters with rubber bullets for no reason.
[00:20:33.681 --> 00:20:37.003]  But I'm also against them standing down and letting people shoot at firefighters.
[00:20:37.504 --> 00:20:38.385]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:39.506]  I'm glad I didn't go up there.
[00:20:40.206 --> 00:20:42.969]  Because people start shooting at me, I'm going to get really upset.
[00:20:43.229 --> 00:20:44.410]  I mean, who are these people?
[00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:46.432]  Do we have any idea who's shooting at the firefighters?
[00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:52.365]  At one point last night, Alex, it was a crazy sight, and I took an epic photo.
[00:20:52.405 --> 00:20:54.627]  I think it's going to be used for years on end.
[00:20:54.987 --> 00:21:00.232]  It was right in front of the Season's Greetings sign on South Florissant, where the police department is.
[00:21:00.532 --> 00:21:05.276]  There were almost a thousand police officers lined up in the street there.
[00:21:05.797 --> 00:21:11.061]  You know, after they had burnt that police vehicle, Ja'Kari Jackson and I were able to scale a building and get on the roof.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.442]  And get some really neat footage overhead of that car.
[00:21:14.663 --> 00:21:17.445]  And then we decided to pull out and come down here on West Florissant.
[00:21:17.905 --> 00:21:23.590]  And when we got out here, all there was were fire trucks out here trying to put out these flames.
[00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:25.391]  And they had no protection at the time.
[00:21:25.431 --> 00:21:26.312]  There was no one out here to keep them.
[00:21:26.332 --> 00:21:27.333]  That's a major system.
[00:21:27.553 --> 00:21:30.135]  You're saying the police did not protect the firefighters?
[00:21:30.754 --> 00:21:31.995]  No, not for a long time.
[00:21:32.055 --> 00:21:39.000]  I mean, by the time the cops got here, they had already made the fire trucks pull back and the buildings were essentially just left to burn to the ground.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:43.184]  And as you can see, this is not the only building on this road that was burnt to the ground.
[00:21:43.204 --> 00:21:44.505]  There are multiple other buildings.
[00:21:44.545 --> 00:21:46.506]  The Sam's Meat Market was on fire.
[00:21:46.706 --> 00:21:51.390]  There was a rental storage, you know, you rent per storage unit, burnt to the ground.
[00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:55.912]  And other places, I heard a church just right up the street on Canfield.
[00:21:56.392 --> 00:22:02.394]  Someone was shot through the window of their car and they found the dead body sitting in the car in the same complex where Michael Brown was shot.
[00:22:02.815 --> 00:22:06.196]  So last night was complete and total chaos.
[00:22:06.276 --> 00:22:13.779]  My mind was blown by the amount of violence and how bad things went so quickly.
[00:22:14.113 --> 00:22:18.276]  I mean, it broke my heart to see these people just sitting here and, you know, where are they going to go now?
[00:22:18.356 --> 00:22:20.637]  You can't even drive on the street now, Alex.
[00:22:21.038 --> 00:22:25.200]  You can't even go out here because it's completely ruined and devastated.
[00:22:25.621 --> 00:22:28.182]  Everyone, almost everyone out here lost their business.
[00:22:28.603 --> 00:22:39.730]  The amount that the people save up to put into this community, to help out, to supply people with hardware, with the burgers, with everything out here, laundry places, all gone.
[00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:41.151]  Where are they going to go now?
[00:22:43.078 --> 00:22:45.360]  It just broke my heart to see this.
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:48.062]  Last night was the craziest thing I've ever seen.
[00:22:48.102 --> 00:22:51.064]  I mean, far surpassed anything I've ever seen in combat.
[00:22:52.785 --> 00:22:53.666]  Elaborate on that.
[00:22:55.167 --> 00:22:59.610]  Just the lack of the humanity.
[00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:01.291]  I mean, it was just out of control.
[00:23:02.172 --> 00:23:02.512]  There was no...
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.141]  Thought about life.
[00:23:06.381 --> 00:23:07.001]  No one cared.
[00:23:07.041 --> 00:23:08.962]  People were popping off shots for no reason.
[00:23:09.382 --> 00:23:12.183]  I mean, I don't know if you guys know, but they stopped the airspace last night.
[00:23:12.223 --> 00:23:12.924]  They shut it down.
[00:23:13.284 --> 00:23:16.985]  People who were flying in, by the time I got home last night, I turned on the local Fox.
[00:23:17.265 --> 00:23:17.866]  They were at the St.
[00:23:17.886 --> 00:23:18.546]  Louis airport.
[00:23:18.834 --> 00:23:21.655]  There was a lady getting ready to pick up her son who was flying in from Denver.
[00:23:21.835 --> 00:23:24.876]  They were five minutes out and told that they had to turn around and go back to Denver.
[00:23:25.116 --> 00:23:29.678]  They stopped flights coming in last night because people were shooting up in the air and they thought that it could hit a plane.
[00:23:30.178 --> 00:23:31.238]  It was out of control.
[00:23:31.258 --> 00:23:32.639]  Well, that's right.
[00:23:32.879 --> 00:23:34.199]  KMOV reports St.
[00:23:34.219 --> 00:23:37.340]  Louis-bound flights rerouted amid protest.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.661]  You guys got some incredible
[00:23:39.321 --> 00:23:43.543]  Footage of the burning and the looting that was going on.
[00:23:43.823 --> 00:23:45.844]  Joe, let me ask you this, because I want to get this straight.
[00:23:46.384 --> 00:23:58.149]  You're saying, as an expert on this, because you've been on at least three tours of heavy combat, are you saying you heard at least a thousand shots in the direction of the police and firefighters?
[00:23:59.229 --> 00:24:01.270]  Well, I don't know what direction they were in at every time.
[00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:06.732]  At one point, I did hear a snap, like one went right by me, and that's when I got behind a building for a minute.
[00:24:06.752 --> 00:24:08.253]  But other than that, I think a lot of them
[00:24:08.937 --> 00:24:14.662]  Uh, they were directed at some of the fire trucks when I first got here, uh, on West Florissant.
[00:24:14.882 --> 00:24:22.228]  And then, you know, the police officers reported last night, too, in the press conference around 2 a.m., that a lot of them, uh, a few police officers were injured.
[00:24:22.308 --> 00:24:25.010]  One was shot pretty bad in the arm and was taken to the hospital.
[00:24:25.391 --> 00:24:31.035]  But a lot of it, I think, was just up in the air and apparently at one person who is now dead sitting in a car.
[00:24:31.095 --> 00:24:33.117]  So, like I said, last night was out of control.
[00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:42.232]  And I was listening to the broadcast before I came on, and you were talking about how a lot of these mainstream media corporations were essentially just running for their lives, and it happened.
[00:24:42.252 --> 00:24:49.154]  I mean, we were sitting out there, Jakari Jackson and I were high-fiving each other because these guys were fleeing and running back there.
[00:24:49.174 --> 00:24:57.496]  They're in a staging area way back here with the National Guard around them and cops patrolling around them, and they're talking about what's going on out here like they have anything to do with what's going on.
[00:24:57.516 --> 00:25:00.796]  The footage you got, you and Jakari, we were just showing some of the footage you guys got.
[00:25:01.177 --> 00:25:03.037]  It looks like something out of a science fiction movie.
[00:25:03.397 --> 00:25:10.819]  Oh, I mean, like I said earlier when I opened the show, there's no words that can explain to actually be here and see it.
[00:25:10.999 --> 00:25:14.739]  The video will never captivate what happened here.
[00:25:14.779 --> 00:25:17.440]  The smell, the aroma, everything burning.
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:28.882]  So why was it wilder than some of those battles you were in that Esquire and Rolling Stone wrote about where there were explosions all around you for hours and fighter jets bombing targets and some of the biggest battles in Afghanistan that you were in?
[00:25:30.302 --> 00:25:32.983]  Because I've got 30 men that I trust with my life.
[00:25:33.427 --> 00:25:36.830]  You know, last night it was me and Jakari and then everyone else, you don't know who they are.
[00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:40.694]  So it was the sheer anarchy, it was the chaos that made it so weird?
[00:25:41.034 --> 00:25:44.177]  Yeah, I mean, it was like me and him against the world almost.
[00:25:44.197 --> 00:25:49.061]  I mean, it was two of us and there were thousands of people out here and gunfire going off everywhere.
[00:25:49.481 --> 00:25:55.967]  I mean, at one point I felt like it was just the craziest thing I'd ever witnessed.
[00:25:57.649 --> 00:25:58.790]  It was just mind-blowing.
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:03.641]  When you guys see the report that's coming up right now, I think it's up now, and they should be getting it.
[00:26:04.021 --> 00:26:05.141]  You guys have to play this.
[00:26:05.201 --> 00:26:08.582]  I mean, it is amazing footage of what happened.
[00:26:08.602 --> 00:26:09.742]  What should the headline be?
[00:26:09.862 --> 00:26:15.763]  Exclusive, you know, frontline Ferguson riot footage?
[00:26:15.863 --> 00:26:20.584]  Or, or, or, or... I mean, what headline should we give this video?
[00:26:23.325 --> 00:26:28.086]  Info wars... I'm trying to think of a good way to...
[00:26:29.775 --> 00:26:32.436]  You need really good words for this because the footage is just so epic.
[00:26:33.557 --> 00:26:36.719]  Epic, uh, Ferguson race war footage?
[00:26:37.459 --> 00:26:37.999]  Yeah, there you go.
[00:26:38.479 --> 00:26:39.060]  Something like that.
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:41.361]  And again, folks, we just have total transparency.
[00:26:41.381 --> 00:26:44.182]  I mean, look at Joe driving while there's burning buildings beside him.
[00:26:44.843 --> 00:26:45.763]  This is crazy.
[00:26:46.323 --> 00:26:47.964]  I'm going to make the call right now, Joe.
[00:26:48.164 --> 00:26:49.625]  I don't want you guys back out there tonight.
[00:26:49.965 --> 00:26:55.288]  I don't want to... I don't want to have you guys shot in the head like the person they killed.
[00:26:56.349 --> 00:26:57.169]  Alex, you know that
[00:26:57.970 --> 00:26:59.812]  It's just going to be hard for me to do something like that.
[00:27:00.252 --> 00:27:02.254]  I'm the kind of guy that I don't run from it.
[00:27:02.314 --> 00:27:03.295]  I have to run towards it.
[00:27:03.816 --> 00:27:04.536]  No, I understand.
[00:27:04.556 --> 00:27:08.000]  I know it's exciting, but I don't, I mean, I don't need to get one of you guys shot for heaven's sake.
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:08.781]  Oh no, we're good.
[00:27:08.841 --> 00:27:10.302]  I mean, we work together great out here.
[00:27:10.322 --> 00:27:11.884]  I mean, there was no issues last night.
[00:27:12.424 --> 00:27:18.550]  Uh, we stayed within maybe two arms length, uh, apart at the most, you know, he, he was down filming really good stuff.
[00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:22.434]  And I was talking to, uh, the nightly news crew back at the studio.
[00:27:22.796 --> 00:27:29.399]  I mean, we maintained a good distance, and at any time, if things got too... Oh yeah, you had bullets flying by your head, man!
[00:27:29.419 --> 00:27:30.299]  Yeah.
[00:27:30.639 --> 00:27:37.382]  I mean, we got footage of you hiding behind the armored veh... I mean, the police are hiding behind the armored vehicle, and then you guys are out there with the bullets flying by.
[00:27:37.702 --> 00:27:38.382]  That is just crazy.
[00:27:38.622 --> 00:27:43.484]  You used the word, though, that a thousand shots you would estimate is what you heard?
[00:27:43.504 --> 00:27:48.767]  I mean, at one point in a five-minute span, I counted about a hundred in my head.
[00:27:49.207 --> 00:27:51.728]  You know, and we were out here for five hours, six hours, so...
[00:27:52.421 --> 00:27:53.301]  You know, do the math.
[00:27:53.321 --> 00:28:00.825]  I mean, at one point, I think for about an hour and a half, every few seconds you heard, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.
[00:28:00.865 --> 00:28:03.107]  And then one time was like, pop, pop, pop, pop.
[00:28:03.267 --> 00:28:05.648]  You know, nonstop.
[00:28:05.708 --> 00:28:11.711]  You know, you know it's bad when the cops are pulling up a blockade of vehicles and then hiding behind it.
[00:28:12.211 --> 00:28:15.253]  And then they're not even worried about people walking up behind them at that point.
[00:28:15.273 --> 00:28:17.854]  They were just hiding, you know.
[00:28:18.014 --> 00:28:19.375]  But I do have to say this.
[00:28:19.455 --> 00:28:21.456]  Last night, the police did
[00:28:22.225 --> 00:28:24.148]  From what I saw, pretty great job.
[00:28:24.208 --> 00:28:26.170]  They did not act the way they did back in August.
[00:28:26.471 --> 00:28:27.752]  They did not attack journalists.
[00:28:28.073 --> 00:28:32.218]  You know, we had one issue with them not letting us come back to our vehicle, but that didn't last long.
[00:28:32.258 --> 00:28:35.323]  I told them I would get over here to the vehicle I did because that's what I do.
[00:28:35.783 --> 00:28:38.427]  But, you know, other than that, they weren't attacking us.
[00:28:38.447 --> 00:28:39.328]  They weren't shooting at us.
[00:28:39.721 --> 00:28:41.421]  They weren't harassing us in any way.
[00:28:41.441 --> 00:28:49.883]  I had people listening to the police scanners and they were being told over the police scanners to leave the media alone, to let them have free reign and coverage over whatever they wanted.
[00:28:50.223 --> 00:28:51.583]  So the cops didn't bother us at all.
[00:28:51.603 --> 00:28:52.883]  So I have to give them props on that.
[00:28:53.304 --> 00:28:57.604]  You know, I didn't see any excessive force last night like we saw in August.
[00:28:57.844 --> 00:29:06.846]  You know, mainly after listening to the two o'clock in the morning press brief by the chief, he said that, you know, we were just going to sit back and treat this like a sporting event.
[00:29:07.367 --> 00:29:08.167]  Or a festival.
[00:29:08.227 --> 00:29:26.754]  We said we were just gonna sit back and, you know, not be, uh, not use excessive force because, you know, they took so much heat from their actions in August that they felt like last night they had to sit back to prove a point that if they're not out there running around and actually being proactive that the city's gonna burn to the ground.
[00:29:26.774 --> 00:29:28.874]  But I was about to say, that's the PSYOP.
[00:29:29.054 --> 00:29:30.835]  Use excessive force up front.
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.121]  Tonight's gonna be ten times worse, I guarantee it.
[00:29:34.361 --> 00:29:40.504]  The amount of National Guard that's gonna be in the area, the helicopters in the air, the police, the agents, everything.
[00:29:40.564 --> 00:29:42.425]  Tonight will be crazy.
[00:29:42.725 --> 00:29:43.645]  Alright, incredible job.
[00:29:43.685 --> 00:29:55.050]  We have the best reporters with the most courage standing there as police fire tear gas and rubber bullets over them at people shooting at them with live ammo from firearms, bouncing off armored vehicles.
[00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:57.992]  This is sensationally out of control.
[00:29:58.712 --> 00:29:59.133]  Stay with us.
[00:29:59.153 --> 00:30:00.234]  We're gonna talk to Jakari next.
[00:30:00.254 --> 00:30:01.796]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.718 --> 00:30:05.422]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.154 --> 00:30:15.136]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:30:15.376 --> 00:30:21.518]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:30:21.698 --> 00:30:28.660]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:30:29.021 --> 00:30:38.864]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.
[00:30:39.524 --> 00:30:45.448]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:30:45.688 --> 00:30:48.370]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:50.271]  And adenosylcobalamin.
[00:30:50.512 --> 00:30:53.854]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:30:54.114 --> 00:30:55.715]  No needles, no injections.
[00:30:55.995 --> 00:30:57.496]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:30:57.656 --> 00:30:58.737]  Try it for yourself.
[00:30:58.857 --> 00:30:59.898]  Discover the secret.
[00:31:00.098 --> 00:31:00.418]  Secret 12.

[00:31:09.945 --> 00:31:10.946]  The experts are clear.
[00:31:11.266 --> 00:31:18.232]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:31:18.373 --> 00:31:24.639]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:24.659 --> 00:31:28.242]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[00:31:28.362 --> 00:31:32.263]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:31:32.584 --> 00:31:37.626]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:31:37.906 --> 00:31:38.806]  Not our iodine.
[00:31:38.906 --> 00:31:42.487]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[00:31:42.727 --> 00:31:45.068]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[00:32:39.755 --> 00:32:43.257]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:32:43.417 --> 00:32:47.379]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:32:47.699 --> 00:32:49.160]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:57.065]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:32:57.345 --> 00:32:58.185]  But for how long?
[00:32:58.486 --> 00:33:04.749]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:33:05.109 --> 00:33:07.931]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:33:13.378 --> 00:33:33.025]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:52.347 --> 00:33:55.748]  Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost our Skype feed to Ferguson.
[00:33:55.768 --> 00:33:58.748]  We're going to try to get Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs back on with us.
[00:34:00.288 --> 00:34:05.729]  If you were up last night watching the live feed for six hours, then you know why I'm so upset.
[00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:08.830]  This was crazy.
[00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:16.971]  And then you just heard Biggs talking about hearing the police talk, even on the news.
[00:34:17.051 --> 00:34:19.152]  The police chief had said, well fine, you want restraint?
[00:34:19.452 --> 00:34:20.292]  We'll show you restraint.
[00:34:21.274 --> 00:34:32.036]  Then they have the media hype all this up, let every thug and gangbanger in the state area come there to use the demonstrations as cover to loot.
[00:34:33.697 --> 00:34:42.779]  And then they start shooting at police and citizens and kill somebody in their car and burn down a whole bunch of buildings, giving protesting a bad name, the First Amendment a bad name.
[00:34:44.819 --> 00:34:48.900]  The police treated the press nice because they were ordered to stand down this time.
[00:34:49.741 --> 00:34:51.722]  Because they wanted everybody to see the looting.
[00:34:53.283 --> 00:34:55.064]  Now, does that say the police themselves are bad?
[00:34:55.144 --> 00:34:55.344]  No.
[00:34:55.644 --> 00:34:57.205]  It's a federally run PSYOP.
[00:34:59.927 --> 00:35:05.350]  And then Obama comes in and says, let's have calm, and he plays the part of the unifier.
[00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:06.751]  The daddy figure.
[00:35:07.151 --> 00:35:10.693]  While all of his surrogates try to stir stuff up, just like they got caught.
[00:35:12.128 --> 00:35:18.113]  In Florida, with the Trayvon Martin situation, running the demonstration meetings, trying to get things going violent.
[00:35:18.333 --> 00:35:22.876]  Because that's all they've got with their constituents, is making it all racially based.
[00:35:24.637 --> 00:35:25.658]  That's what they're going for.
[00:35:26.279 --> 00:35:30.762]  Now, the video has now gone up on YouTube, that we've been playing in the background.
[00:35:30.782 --> 00:35:35.826]  If you're a radio listener, we simulcast television at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:35:37.432 --> 00:35:48.876]  Starting at about six o'clock central tonight when it gets dark, we'll have the nightly news on with our reporters on the ground with our roundtable in there breaking everything down.
[00:35:51.017 --> 00:35:58.079]  I will probably come in later in the evening and give the crew some relief.
[00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:02.310]  When they've been broadcasting for three or four hours.
[00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:03.971]  And we will continue to cover this.
[00:36:04.011 --> 00:36:06.251]  But this isn't just about race riots.
[00:36:06.291 --> 00:36:08.652]  It isn't just about race war, as one state senator called it.
[00:36:09.072 --> 00:36:11.712]  It's about cultural manipulation.
[00:36:12.452 --> 00:36:14.813]  And it's about understanding how the manipulation works.
[00:36:15.273 --> 00:36:24.774]  But it's also about being able to watch the news and to see the manipulation there and to learn how that works.
[00:36:25.315 --> 00:36:27.435]  This is about decompartmentalizing the police,
[00:36:28.607 --> 00:36:32.770]  The general public, everybody, so that we understand the larger game plan.
[00:36:33.471 --> 00:36:34.772]  Delta Force was at Waco.
[00:36:35.853 --> 00:36:37.374]  I forgot to ask Joe Biggs about that.
[00:36:37.914 --> 00:36:40.776]  Delta Force was in Seattle for the WTO.
[00:36:41.056 --> 00:36:45.160]  They set the precedent for the armored vehicles, the federalization, the black uniforms in 99.
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:49.703]  They used these as rollout events and you could see the media hyping it.
[00:36:50.764 --> 00:36:51.724]  That's the reason we covered it.
[00:36:51.885 --> 00:36:53.466]  We don't usually cover what the media is hyping.
[00:36:54.534 --> 00:37:08.601]  But if they're hyping it for an event, we've got to get involved covering it so that we can try to affect the overall PSYOP for a better outcome of enlightening people, not further caging them mentally.
[00:37:08.781 --> 00:37:11.282]  But we're going to air the audio and the video of this.
[00:37:11.642 --> 00:37:15.484]  The problem is there's so much cussing on the video by the rioters.
[00:37:16.425 --> 00:37:19.726]  There's a reason, folks, that I don't go to these type of events.
[00:37:20.487 --> 00:37:22.548]  If cops shoot me with rubber bullets for no reason,
[00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:25.971]  And point, he loaded M16s at me with no reason.
[00:37:26.252 --> 00:37:27.052]  I'm gonna get upset.
[00:37:27.392 --> 00:37:28.973]  So I just don't put myself in that position.
[00:37:29.333 --> 00:37:30.434]  Everybody knows I've done it a lot.
[00:37:30.454 --> 00:37:34.836]  I've been arrested five, six times for demonstrating peacefully, or not even demonstrating, just being a reporter.
[00:37:35.857 --> 00:37:39.419]  I'm glad that Joe Biggs and Jakari can put up with all this.
[00:37:40.159 --> 00:37:41.380]  Joe got shot, you name it.
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:44.762]  Now last night, oh, come right on in, reporters.
[00:37:44.842 --> 00:37:45.963]  Yes, we know your media.
[00:37:46.403 --> 00:37:46.963]  That's fine.
[00:37:47.003 --> 00:37:48.204]  Now go show the bad looters.
[00:37:49.912 --> 00:37:55.239]  So there is no good or bad guys in this, except I guess the firefighters and the media trying to cover it.
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:59.203]  Because I'm telling you, if I was a shopkeeper, I wouldn't board it up.
[00:38:00.106 --> 00:38:01.726]  I would just sit there and wait with my guns.
[00:38:02.207 --> 00:38:12.490]  Because I am sick of just criminal mobs of thugs going around and attacking, trying to block people on the road who are in their cars, clearly targeting people racially.
[00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:16.951]  It would disgust me to see a mob of white people acting like this versus, you know, black folks.
[00:38:17.451 --> 00:38:21.172]  And again, that's what this is all about, ladies and gentlemen, is division.
[00:38:23.213 --> 00:38:27.834]  But clearly, you got a bunch of criminals using this as their cover to act however they want.
[00:38:28.772 --> 00:38:33.354]  You've got the system using the criminal element as a pretext to take over society.
[00:38:33.414 --> 00:38:34.414]  That's the bottom line.
[00:38:34.834 --> 00:38:48.499]  And the fact that they announced the verdict at 8 o'clock at night, or 7 o'clock at night, and, you know, waited a few hours, waited until it got dark, and sat on it to the exact moment when it would have the worst effect possible, is incredible.
[00:38:48.759 --> 00:38:52.041]  But again, fires burn in Ferguson, gunshots heard in the streets.
[00:38:52.081 --> 00:38:54.662]  We'll be covering it all tonight and tomorrow, the aftermath.
[00:38:55.162 --> 00:38:58.263]  MSNBC anchor chased off air by gunfire.
[00:39:00.737 --> 00:39:04.420]  Ferguson grand jury decision, CNN and Fox News reporters attacked on air.
[00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:07.803]  Networks go live to Obama remarks over no indictment.
[00:39:08.123 --> 00:39:13.628]  I mean, what is the president doing responding to a police officer-involved shooting?
[00:39:14.108 --> 00:39:16.110]  By the way, they had black witnesses that came in.
[00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:18.732]  I have the grand jury transcripts here.
[00:39:19.213 --> 00:39:23.076]  Everybody already knows about this, saying that Brown charged him.
[00:39:26.201 --> 00:39:30.463]  And had already gone at him once, and that basically the cop told the truth.
[00:39:31.524 --> 00:39:34.505]  Is it good that this young black man is dead?
[00:39:36.186 --> 00:39:37.026]  No, it's not good.
[00:39:37.066 --> 00:39:40.788]  Is it good that he was strong-arming a business right before?
[00:39:40.828 --> 00:39:46.591]  I mean, this is the culture now in America, is to promote being thugs.
[00:39:47.851 --> 00:39:50.012]  And it's growing across the board.
[00:39:51.593 --> 00:39:55.215]  And that's what got Mr. Brown killed, in my view.
[00:39:57.079 --> 00:40:00.783]  But what about 52% of black people never being born?
[00:40:01.163 --> 00:40:02.765]  You're not going to hear a word out of the media on that.
[00:40:02.805 --> 00:40:04.126]  You're going to have riots about that.
[00:40:04.707 --> 00:40:10.933]  I mean, I would see riots as it comes out that cancer viruses have been put in vaccines and sterilants here in the U.S.
[00:40:11.353 --> 00:40:13.035]  You know, you get sterilized for something?
[00:40:14.136 --> 00:40:14.736]  Can't have kids?
[00:40:14.777 --> 00:40:15.737]  That's a reason to riot.
[00:40:16.018 --> 00:40:18.841]  But you don't go riot with cops or burn down your own neighborhood.
[00:40:19.081 --> 00:40:20.782]  You go after the pharmaceutical company.
[00:40:21.505 --> 00:40:22.906]  And I'm not saying do that.
[00:40:23.646 --> 00:40:28.308]  But then you could argue, well, you know, they're going after somebody that did something to them and there was no justice.
[00:40:29.049 --> 00:40:36.572]  But if we put out enough news about what's in the vaccines and about abortion, culturally there'll be a backlash where politically they'll get prosecuted.
[00:40:41.055 --> 00:40:42.755]  But again, the firefighters did their job.
[00:40:42.796 --> 00:40:47.478]  They went in and they got shot at by people trying to burn down the community.
[00:40:48.635 --> 00:40:48.695]  And
[00:41:04.686 --> 00:41:18.632]  The Merry Christmas over the Ferguson Main Street with the armored vehicles and the smoke and the flashbangs being fired and the tear gas being fired as bullets are fired back the other direction, pinging off the metal structures.
[00:41:19.072 --> 00:41:23.474]  I mean, you have definitely been in the middle of combat now, Jakari.
[00:41:24.074 --> 00:41:27.335]  And again, you guys will not tonight go stand in the middle of it.
[00:41:27.815 --> 00:41:31.757]  I want you guys behind something metal, taking a cue from the police.
[00:41:31.797 --> 00:41:33.598]  I mean, I know you want to get the most epic footage,
[00:41:34.258 --> 00:41:36.460]  But, uh, and we have the epic footage.
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:38.181]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[00:41:38.581 --> 00:41:43.165]  Independent media stands in face of Ferguson gunfire while mainstream media flees.
[00:41:43.465 --> 00:41:45.386]  That's got the HD video right there.
[00:41:45.807 --> 00:41:49.309]  Inside the Battle of Ferguson, Jakari Jackson, what do you have to say?
[00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:52.631]  Jakari Jackson reporting from Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:41:52.672 --> 00:41:53.372]  That's right, Alex.
[00:41:53.492 --> 00:41:54.273]  It was wild.
[00:41:54.313 --> 00:41:58.396]  Helicopters, burning buildings, gunshots, tear gas.
[00:41:58.776 --> 00:42:00.297]  Saw a car crash a couple days ago.
[00:42:00.757 --> 00:42:01.278]  This has been
[00:42:02.615 --> 00:42:06.882]  At least for me, I'm sure for Joe as well, one of the most epic things I've ever witnessed.
[00:42:07.924 --> 00:42:10.949]  Especially to see that this happened in the United States of America.
[00:42:11.554 --> 00:42:15.336]  And as Joe said earlier, by and large, the police were on their best behavior.
[00:42:15.356 --> 00:42:17.538]  We had no issues with them last night.
[00:42:17.778 --> 00:42:25.142]  We did have some issues, or at least we saw some other journalists who had issues with a few of the protesters, I don't want to call them protesters, a few of the people out in the crowd.
[00:42:25.443 --> 00:42:28.204]  We actually encountered a guy after we left the police station.
[00:42:28.244 --> 00:42:32.527]  We were walking to our vehicle, about to drive down here to our current location, where the building burned down.
[00:42:32.787 --> 00:42:37.630]  The video that you were talking about where Joe was driving the car and the building's burning, that's the building back there.
[00:42:38.197 --> 00:42:39.497]  So we encountered a journalist.
[00:42:39.717 --> 00:42:41.238]  He said, hey, can I get in the car with you guys?
[00:42:41.258 --> 00:42:43.078]  Some guys just try to jump me and take my camera.
[00:42:43.298 --> 00:42:44.719]  We said, yeah, so get in the car with us.
[00:42:45.099 --> 00:42:47.480]  So we drive down here and we're out walking around.
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:48.840]  We see the firefighters.
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.080]  We see the burning buildings.
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:51.521]  And then some guys approach Joe.
[00:42:51.781 --> 00:42:53.421]  I'm not sure if this got on camera.
[00:42:53.441 --> 00:42:54.422]  I didn't get it on my camera.
[00:42:54.662 --> 00:42:55.742]  But some guys walk up to Joe.
[00:42:56.673 --> 00:42:58.094]  And they're about to mess with him.
[00:42:58.354 --> 00:43:00.515]  See, he has an InfoWars microphone on his chest.
[00:43:00.535 --> 00:43:01.716]  He has it strapped to his vest.
[00:43:01.736 --> 00:43:03.137]  He says, oh, InfoWars, you guys are cool.
[00:43:03.157 --> 00:43:03.938]  I'm not going to mess with you.
[00:43:04.158 --> 00:43:05.699]  Then he goes and messes with some other people.
[00:43:06.019 --> 00:43:10.282]  It was bizarre the amount of stuff that was going on out here last night.
[00:43:10.302 --> 00:43:11.122]  Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[00:43:11.182 --> 00:43:13.684]  If somebody punches you or Joe, I mean, you're going to fight back.
[00:43:13.704 --> 00:43:14.744]  They're going to get their butt kicked.
[00:43:15.085 --> 00:43:18.827]  It's not like you're some MSNBC reporter that's going to fall down on the ground in a fetal position.
[00:43:19.591 --> 00:43:20.572]  Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[00:43:20.632 --> 00:43:21.952]  But, you know, we didn't have those issues.
[00:43:22.353 --> 00:43:28.716]  You know, after everybody realized we weren't cops, you know, that was the rumor for a couple of days until people started to go back and watch our videos.
[00:43:28.736 --> 00:43:29.777]  Like, okay, these guys are cool.
[00:43:30.117 --> 00:43:32.658]  After they realized that, they didn't, they haven't messed with us since.
[00:43:33.078 --> 00:43:37.721]  But, you know, we were out here, they were shooting the gunfire right over in this direction.
[00:43:37.761 --> 00:43:39.382]  Just pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.
[00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:44.732]  I mean, guys going through entire magazines and, you know, at the time I couldn't believe they were shooting that many shots.
[00:43:44.752 --> 00:43:49.113]  I'm like, they have to be shooting them in the air because nobody would shoot that many shots at somebody.
[00:43:49.513 --> 00:43:51.954]  Although, we've seen that happen in previous things.
[00:43:52.314 --> 00:43:53.814]  So, they were shooting over here.
[00:43:53.834 --> 00:43:55.235]  We were next to the firefighters.
[00:43:55.495 --> 00:43:58.036]  If you guys watch the video, it's when the video goes to night vision.
[00:43:58.356 --> 00:44:00.056]  And you can hear the call come over the radio.
[00:44:00.096 --> 00:44:01.057]  He's like, get out of there!
[00:44:01.097 --> 00:44:02.777]  You know, some guy talking to the firefighters.
[00:44:02.797 --> 00:44:03.517]  He's like, get out there!
[00:44:03.537 --> 00:44:04.198]  It's too dangerous!
[00:44:04.498 --> 00:44:06.418]  And the guys, you know, nothing against the firefighters.
[00:44:06.438 --> 00:44:07.439]  They're just following their orders.
[00:44:07.759 --> 00:44:08.739]  They got up and they left.
[00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:12.817]  And actually they got up and left in such a hurry they left their fire hoses behind.
[00:44:13.334 --> 00:44:17.697]  But myself and Joe Biggs, we remained on the scene and continued to record.
[00:44:17.877 --> 00:44:21.520]  Then we go down the street to where the Martial Law Command Base was last time.
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:25.383]  Now they have the National Guard post up there as well as the media area.
[00:44:25.403 --> 00:44:26.924]  A lot of your satellite trucks are up the street.
[00:44:27.485 --> 00:44:31.267]  And we get in there and we see the Humvees driving around in a circle.
[00:44:31.528 --> 00:44:36.271]  We see that shot where I'm shooting over Joe's shoulder and you can see the city burning in front of him.
[00:44:36.591 --> 00:44:38.753]  You know, it was so wild, so bizarre.
[00:44:39.173 --> 00:44:44.119]  I mean, it was really, you know, we experienced an action movie last night, and I don't mean that in a good sense.
[00:44:46.202 --> 00:44:46.742]  Wow, Jakari.
[00:44:46.762 --> 00:44:47.703]  It was completely wild.
[00:44:48.204 --> 00:44:50.427]  What else do you expect to see happen tonight?
[00:44:50.707 --> 00:44:52.049]  Joe thinks it's going to be a lot worse.
[00:44:53.305 --> 00:44:59.250]  Well, if you think about some of the riots previously, you know, the second night is, you know, when people get really amped up.
[00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:07.237]  We've seen the police, you know, they've been kind to media, but they are, you know, pretty much standing back, waiting in the wings, just making sure that they're not attacked.
[00:45:07.737 --> 00:45:12.181]  So I'm not sure if they're going to get more proactive as far as stopping the looting, the rioting.
[00:45:13.082 --> 00:45:18.507]  There were some stores right in front of the police station, the Boost Mobile store that I walked into in that footage.
[00:45:18.787 --> 00:45:21.049]  That is directly across the street from the police station.
[00:45:21.489 --> 00:45:24.951]  So, and you contrast that with what's going on in Clayton, Missouri.
[00:45:24.971 --> 00:45:27.573]  We shot those reports this past weekend.
[00:45:28.113 --> 00:45:29.074]  Everything is blocked off.
[00:45:29.414 --> 00:45:32.076]  I mean, the police station has a barricade going all the way around it.
[00:45:32.116 --> 00:45:34.837]  The Just Center has a barricade going all the way around it.
[00:45:34.877 --> 00:45:37.419]  They locked that area down, but you contrast that
[00:45:37.779 --> 00:45:38.280]  We're good to go.
[00:45:54.854 --> 00:45:56.095]  We're good to go.
[00:46:25.394 --> 00:46:28.175]  About the fact that they made the announcement.
[00:46:29.555 --> 00:46:47.941]  I think it was a horrible decision to make it that late at night because we first heard about I think we were live on the show with David probably about one or two o'clock when they announced they had come to the decision we're like okay well we'll hear the decision pretty soon like we're gonna wait till eight o'clock you know they made it like some primetime TV event you know some made for TV movie made for TV reality show.
[00:46:47.961 --> 00:46:50.821]  They kept building it out kept coming out absolutely.
[00:46:51.542 --> 00:46:53.202]  Yeah and then they just waited till it got dark
[00:46:53.587 --> 00:47:16.400]  Everybody's out there in front of the police station the beginning of that video you've been showing that's immediately after the verdict is announced and you know people are mad and they're you know voicing their opinions and then it all went downhill from there you know they could have announced it early in the day you know people were at work at school or wherever they are but they wait till everybody comes out everybody's out in front of the police station ready to do whatever they're going to do you know by and large let's not stop
[00:47:17.443 --> 00:47:19.106]  And forget about the peaceful demonstrators.
[00:47:19.126 --> 00:47:20.167]  There are plenty of peaceful people.
[00:47:20.187 --> 00:47:24.514]  You know, they were upset with the verdict, but they went home and they went about their normal business.
[00:47:24.734 --> 00:47:32.847]  You know, the people who came out here, a lot of people are calling them outside agitators, provocateurs, people who don't live in this community who were out here burning down the buildings last night.
[00:47:32.967 --> 00:47:33.347]  That's right.
[00:47:33.387 --> 00:47:40.112]  There are criminals that use the protests and the police behavior as a cover.
[00:47:40.592 --> 00:47:51.700]  And if the police wouldn't have attacked folks early on, then it wouldn't have turned the tide politically against them for a while to then allow criminals to take advantage of it.
[00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:54.162]  And look, they way overuse the terrorist label.
[00:47:55.734 --> 00:48:02.520]  When they, you know, say that gun owners and veterans are terrorists or if you're in the Tea Party you might be a terrorist or your speech is terrorism.
[00:48:02.861 --> 00:48:13.431]  But when you've got people coming to shoot firefighters and to shoot police because you don't like a grand jury verdict and you're trying to kill them to send a political message...
[00:48:14.588 --> 00:48:15.589]  That is the definition.
[00:48:16.391 --> 00:48:22.159]  Violence or the threat of violence to achieve a political or economic aim is the definition of terrorism.
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:27.366]  And I gotta say it, you know, notice the media aren't calling these people terrorists now.
[00:48:28.357 --> 00:48:35.818]  But, with the Tea Party, if somebody sends a threatening letter to an abortuary, they call it paper terrorism.
[00:48:35.838 --> 00:48:44.060]  So I just want to illustrate here that I think the organized getting-together-and-shooting-a-thousand-rounds-at-police-and-firefighters is terrorism.
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:54.342]  And I think it's terrorizing the First Amendment, and it's a terroristic threat against the media to have the police brutalizing and shooting reporters like you and Jakari with rubber bullets.
[00:48:55.362 --> 00:49:01.691]  I'm mad at that, and I'm really mad at people shooting at the cops and firefighters with lead bullets, because that makes the Second Amendment look bad.
[00:49:02.372 --> 00:49:03.694]  What's your take on that, Jakari?
[00:49:04.215 --> 00:49:05.116]  Oh, that's exactly right.
[00:49:05.156 --> 00:49:07.179]  That's what all the anti-gun people say.
[00:49:07.199 --> 00:49:11.185]  Well, look, you see all these people, they're going to talk about those record gun sales, and they're going to say all the guns
[00:49:11.584 --> 00:49:11.784]  What's
[00:49:29.386 --> 00:49:31.046]  Because of situations like this.
[00:49:31.427 --> 00:49:38.848]  You know, if they would have did what they did in Clayton, and had a more secure environment, it would have been less damage out here, I'm confident of that.
[00:49:38.868 --> 00:49:42.349]  I guarantee you, the police, they were broken up in real teams.
[00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:45.550]  See somebody shooting a gun, boom, take them down.
[00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:48.011]  If a few of those criminals had got shot early on...
[00:49:49.071 --> 00:49:50.832]  All the criminals would have dispersed immediately.
[00:49:51.232 --> 00:49:53.253]  They know they've got the green light, Jakari.
[00:49:53.493 --> 00:49:58.255]  Since you mentioned it, I want to play this clip from the incredible footage you and Joe shot.
[00:49:58.556 --> 00:50:02.097]  The video's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com if you're a radio listener.
[00:50:02.117 --> 00:50:07.340]  You've got to see this, where they order the firefighters to pull out as you are being shot at.
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:15.804]  There are bullets bouncing around as this happens, and we've got all the footage of the boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, where criminal terrorists, and that's what they are,
[00:50:16.845 --> 00:50:18.418]  Are out there shooting at the firefighters.
[00:50:18.459 --> 00:50:18.761]  Here it is.
[00:50:37.406 --> 00:50:38.286]  It is wild.
[00:50:39.307 --> 00:50:40.247]  Buildings have been looted.
[00:50:40.267 --> 00:50:46.490]  I personally have witnessed a McDonald's or seen the aftermath of a McDonald's.
[00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:48.391]  There's more of it on InfoWars.com.
[00:50:48.431 --> 00:50:51.932]  Some of that may not come through AM radio well, but I can hear it clearly.
[00:50:52.333 --> 00:50:53.273]  Jakari, stay there.
[00:50:53.293 --> 00:50:55.014]  I want to get final comments from you and Joe Beggs.
[00:50:55.254 --> 00:50:58.355]  I want to talk to Joe about Delta Force being there.
[00:50:58.875 --> 00:51:04.178]  We've got photos and videos of that up on InfoWars.com, but the exclusive footage that people need to see.
[00:51:04.758 --> 00:51:07.534]  Where we show all sides of it is on InfoWars.com.
[00:51:09.534 --> 00:51:14.835]  Hey everyone, my Ghost 80% AR-15 project was a total success!
[00:51:15.155 --> 00:51:17.656]  Thank you Guns80.com, thank you.
[00:51:18.056 --> 00:51:20.437]  I bought my Ghost AR-15 at Guns80.com.
[00:51:20.517 --> 00:51:22.317]  It's everything I expected and more.
[00:51:22.798 --> 00:51:28.119]  Just got a note from my buddy Mark and now they're having a huge Black Friday and a big Cyber Monday sale.
[00:51:28.459 --> 00:51:30.159]  Guess Christmas is coming early this year.
[00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:34.361]  I'm definitely ordering one for my brother on Black Friday because the price drops to 400 bucks.
[00:51:36.061 --> 00:51:37.922]  Yes, I did just say that.
[00:51:38.142 --> 00:51:37.922]  $400.
[00:51:38.182 --> 00:51:40.022]  Unbelievable.

[00:52:09.173 --> 00:52:12.355]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:52:12.675 --> 00:52:20.659]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:52:20.899 --> 00:52:26.022]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[00:53:28.065 --> 00:53:32.548]  This new technology is hundreds of times more effective than colloidal or ionic silver.

[00:54:05.702 --> 00:54:07.425]  SupernaturalSilver.com.
[00:54:45.231 --> 00:54:48.033]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:54:48.093 --> 00:54:48.574]  to 2 p.m.
[00:54:48.614 --> 00:54:49.895]  Central, we're here live.
[00:54:50.275 --> 00:54:52.877]  This broadcast is not about dumbing down the information.
[00:54:53.738 --> 00:55:05.927]  It's about seeing all sides of it, studying it through the lens of history, and trying to really understand where it's all going and how the unseen hand of the globalist is trying to manipulate things.
[00:55:06.327 --> 00:55:08.129]  Doesn't mean the New World Order is in total control.
[00:55:08.449 --> 00:55:14.674]  They're trying to build a panopticonic, omnipresent grid that is anti-human.
[00:55:15.945 --> 00:55:33.807]  And at the end of the day, whether you're black, white, Hispanic, Asian, it doesn't matter, in Ferguson or anywhere else, the globalists want to create racial division, they want to create fear, they've militarized rap music and hip-hop, declassified, to create a thug culture, to prepare black men especially for prison.
[00:55:35.182 --> 00:55:41.566]  We've got a Rick Ross interview that he did in studio with me when he was here a few weeks ago that's condensed.
[00:55:41.927 --> 00:55:44.448]  It's a powerful calling out of the fake Rick Ross.
[00:55:44.849 --> 00:55:47.230]  We're going to air that at the bottom of the third hour today.
[00:55:47.791 --> 00:55:53.175]  In the second and third hour, though, we're going to cover other world news, get into Ferguson and take your phone calls.
[00:55:53.195 --> 00:55:58.238]  In fact, the whole next hour, because this is bigger than Ferguson, it's about understanding the PSYOP.
[00:55:58.278 --> 00:55:58.939]  It's all coming up.
[00:56:00.368 --> 00:56:06.950]  I told everybody that Secret 12, proprietary, B12, super organic, the type that people inject.
[00:56:07.731 --> 00:56:10.131]  This is, you know, nutraceutical, pharmaceutical grade.
[00:56:11.112 --> 00:56:14.273]  Nobody's ever put something out like this on the open market.
[00:56:14.453 --> 00:56:15.333]  It's legal and lawful.
[00:56:15.553 --> 00:56:18.794]  Just nobody would dare put something this expensive out at a low price.
[00:56:19.034 --> 00:56:24.596]  They'd rather put synthetic, cheap, vitamin B12 that you can get for $2 a bottle and sell it for $30.
[00:56:25.256 --> 00:56:26.677]  Well no, we get medical grade.
[00:56:28.669 --> 00:56:32.412]  So, you know, we have something that costs us $10, $12 a bottle and sell it for $20 something.
[00:56:33.473 --> 00:56:34.294]  We still have a markup.
[00:56:34.334 --> 00:56:35.375]  We still fund our operation.
[00:56:35.415 --> 00:56:36.816]  We just want to give you the very best.
[00:56:37.256 --> 00:56:38.858]  You get maximum absorption.
[00:56:39.178 --> 00:56:42.721]  The only way you get better absorption is getting a prescription and getting the injectable.
[00:56:43.021 --> 00:56:45.383]  This is the same as the injectable, but this is not for injection.
[00:56:47.065 --> 00:56:48.806]  Because that has a bunch of preservatives and stuff in it.
[00:56:48.846 --> 00:56:53.410]  This has nothing in it but real vitamin B12, two different types of organic.
[00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:54.231]  80% the injectable type.
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:57.560]  There's about a hundred bottles left.
[00:56:58.001 --> 00:57:00.281]  I just asked Buckley, I said, you know, how much is left?
[00:57:00.341 --> 00:57:01.521]  He said, yeah, we're about to pull it.
[00:57:02.401 --> 00:57:05.342]  You know, we almost sold out of it in two days, then it tailed off.
[00:57:06.502 --> 00:57:08.743]  Well, if you want it, we won't have it for weeks, if not months.
[00:57:08.763 --> 00:57:12.704]  If you want Secret 12, Infowarslife.com right now.
[00:57:13.084 --> 00:57:15.864]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:15.964 --> 00:57:16.344]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:57:16.364 --> 00:57:16.604]  Also,
[00:57:25.945 --> 00:57:33.590]  It took us two and a half months to get more silver bullet, super high quality, colloidal silver from the biggest and best lab in the country.
[00:57:33.970 --> 00:57:36.432]  They supply the largest organic shopping
[00:57:38.550 --> 00:57:39.611]  market out there in the country.
[00:57:39.631 --> 00:57:46.034]  This is the same stuff as you find there, just with our label, for five to ten dollars cheaper, depending on what they're selling it for at the time.
[00:57:46.094 --> 00:57:52.857]  So it's the best known colloidal silver from our research out there, from the best lab, thirty parts per million, at the lowest price.
[00:57:53.257 --> 00:57:54.498]  Silver bullet colloidal silver.
[00:57:55.358 --> 00:58:05.843]  Again, we just did our biggest run ever, predicting people wanted this during this critical time of the year, with all the different illnesses and things that are going on, and viruses move better in the cold, and immune systems are down.
[00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:10.934]  Silver Bullet, ladies and gentlemen, is what I'm doing to bolster my body's natural defenses.
[00:58:11.054 --> 00:58:15.198]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:15.238 --> 00:58:18.200]  This will be sold out in about a week at current sales.
[00:58:18.781 --> 00:58:20.042]  So I would stock up your cupboard.
[00:58:20.342 --> 00:58:22.084]  It's a great gift to give friends and family.
[00:58:22.344 --> 00:58:26.108]  It's great topical when I get cut or have a rash or a bacterial infection.
[00:58:26.608 --> 00:58:26.868]  Boom!
[00:58:27.649 --> 00:58:37.015]  Silver Bullets, what I personally use, Infowarslife.com, our private label of the best colloidal silver out there on the market, and the price is incredibly affordable as well.
[00:58:37.296 --> 00:58:40.338]  And all the other high-quality products at Infowarslife.com.
[00:58:40.758 --> 00:58:42.159]  This is the perfect Christmas gift.
[00:58:42.179 --> 00:58:46.041]  You can shop early, but it may not be available in a week or so, so I would order now.
[00:58:46.402 --> 00:58:52.366]  More with Jakari Jackson, Joe Biggs, your phone calls coming up second hour inside the Battle of Ferguson.
[00:58:52.406 --> 00:58:54.227]  It's going to get bigger tonight, unfortunately.
[00:58:54.267 --> 00:58:56.068]  This could spread to other cities.
[00:58:56.088 --> 00:58:56.488]  Stay with us.
[00:58:59.590 --> 00:59:00.831]  Another major health threat.
[00:59:00.851 --> 00:59:05.753]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:59:05.833 --> 00:59:08.474]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:59:08.514 --> 00:59:15.277]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:59:15.557 --> 00:59:18.418]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:59:18.538 --> 00:59:21.480]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:23.481]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:59:23.501 --> 00:59:26.362]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:59:26.442 --> 00:59:31.924]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:59:32.144 --> 00:59:35.625]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:59:35.645 --> 00:59:38.646]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:59:38.746 --> 00:59:45.848]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[00:59:46.068 --> 00:59:49.129]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[00:59:55.751 --> 00:59:56.192]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:59:56.352 --> 00:59:57.393]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:15.441 --> 01:00:16.082]  Big Brother.
[01:00:16.742 --> 01:00:17.763]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:18.504 --> 01:00:19.585]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:20.265 --> 01:00:21.066]  You want answers?
[01:00:21.846 --> 01:00:22.747]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.408 --> 01:00:27.011]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.591 --> 01:00:31.695]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.116 --> 01:00:40.522]  Well, eyewitnesses told the grand jury, black eyewitnesses, that Brown charged the police officer and had been attacking him, basically.
[01:00:40.582 --> 01:00:43.705]  I'm not endorsing the police state or how our country's degenerated.
[01:00:45.026 --> 01:00:47.409]  But the globalists want to produce a thug culture.
[01:00:48.511 --> 01:00:52.156]  We have the special report with Rick Ross coming up where he breaks that down.
[01:00:53.278 --> 01:00:54.860]  The hip-hop to prison pipeline.
[01:00:56.442 --> 01:00:58.125]  I'm gonna give the number out at the start of the next segment.
[01:00:58.385 --> 01:00:59.327]  Start going to your phone calls.
[01:01:00.467 --> 01:01:03.950]  Joe Biggs, we were going to go back to him and talk about Delta Force that he saw there.
[01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:05.991]  We'll do that in the next segment briefly.
[01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:08.693]  He had to go because he's working on a big story.
[01:01:09.754 --> 01:01:12.576]  So Jakari is back in front of the camera in Ferguson.
[01:01:13.617 --> 01:01:16.278]  Jakari, I mean, the PSYOP is so obvious.
[01:01:16.559 --> 01:01:24.264]  When they make the announcement at 7.30 at night, the worst time to do it, with all that hype, they kept coming out over and over again, we're going to announce, we're going to announce it.
[01:01:24.925 --> 01:01:26.206]  Having the police stand down,
[01:01:27.535 --> 01:01:28.696]  Letting it get hyped up.
[01:01:29.476 --> 01:01:34.479]  MSNBC and CNN trying to, you know, basically legitimize, you know, the looters as protesters.
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:38.502]  I mean, I think this all is very, very suspicious.
[01:01:39.782 --> 01:01:42.284]  What's your bottom line on what you're expecting?
[01:01:42.304 --> 01:01:51.610]  Because if this continues tonight and another day, if it starts to spread to other cities, this could be a major political distraction from all the executive orders and the rest of it.
[01:01:55.732 --> 01:01:56.913]  What do you think is happening, Jakari?
[01:01:58.231 --> 01:02:01.612]  Yes, I believe it is a major political distraction because we see this.
[01:02:01.872 --> 01:02:03.853]  They just announced the amnesty.
[01:02:03.913 --> 01:02:07.334]  So I think it definitely is conveniently located.
[01:02:07.354 --> 01:02:09.174]  You know, never let a good crisis go to waste.
[01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:12.475]  The new people were very focused on the Ferguson issue.
[01:02:12.895 --> 01:02:14.436]  So it's going to distract from anything.
[01:02:14.456 --> 01:02:19.818]  You know, who knows what else is going to be run through during this time when everybody's so focused on what's going on here.
[01:02:19.838 --> 01:02:24.399]  And this is an important story, but there are many other things going on in the United States as well.
[01:02:26.849 --> 01:02:31.553]  Sure, and I mean what type of country gets brought to its knees over a police shooting?
[01:02:32.754 --> 01:02:38.298]  I mean clearly there's good shootings by police, there's bad shootings, there's good cases of citizens shooting people, there's bad cases.
[01:02:38.959 --> 01:02:47.065]  Since when can the media decide to make something the big giant event and then all hell breaks loose predictably?
[01:02:47.125 --> 01:02:47.706]  It's so sad.
[01:02:49.076 --> 01:03:04.051]  Yeah it is sad and as I was talking with David a couple days ago and he's asking why this shooting because we see other shootings that or other episodes of a police interaction that are much more cut and dry you know things where it's really not debated that the police officer acted you know outside of his
[01:03:05.086 --> 01:03:05.186]  Yes.
[01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:38.599]  The right time, the right area, they had the right type of populace, the right type of police response at that time to push the narrative.
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:46.125]  So I think that's really how they got on this particular issue and there have been many other shootings before and since that didn't get near as much fanfare.
[01:03:47.943 --> 01:03:57.650]  Alright, Jakari, I know you've got some people there talking over the mic, so I'm going to come back to you and finish up after the break, after we can move away or get to a position where you're not getting talked over.
[01:03:57.710 --> 01:04:05.395]  Then we'll talk to Joe about his military perspective on the Spec Ops folks from Fort Bragg with North Carolina Plates.
[01:04:05.475 --> 01:04:08.297]  Clearly Army there, clearly 35 years old or so, maybe 40.
[01:04:10.678 --> 01:04:16.322]  Quite a few of them running around the courthouse and the fact that they're there really escalates this.
[01:04:16.382 --> 01:04:17.442]  We'll talk to you after the break.
[01:04:17.783 --> 01:04:27.168]  That's Sha'Carri Jackson from the epicenter of the looting and the rioting last night and people shooting at the first responders.
[01:04:28.349 --> 01:04:29.230]  Outrageous!
[01:04:30.551 --> 01:04:31.991]  Absolutely outrageous!
[01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:43.397]  It just makes my head spin that when we caught people with Moloff cocktails and caught people throwing them, right there the police wouldn't go after them because they've been ordered not to.
[01:04:44.895 --> 01:04:46.736]  But they would shoot our people with rubber bullets.
[01:04:47.296 --> 01:04:50.638]  I mean, I don't even want to demonize the police, but what do you say about that?
[01:04:51.218 --> 01:04:55.460]  There's clearly an agenda in the orders they're being given to escalate this.
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:59.962]  And we said, if they make the announcement early in the night and do all this, they won a big event.
[01:05:00.382 --> 01:05:03.084]  If the police didn't stand down and allow looting, they won a big event.
[01:05:03.304 --> 01:05:07.005]  They're trying to prime the whole country to blow up like in the 60s.
[01:05:07.346 --> 01:05:07.806]  Stay with us.
[01:05:09.875 --> 01:05:15.236]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:05:16.516 --> 01:05:21.277]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:05:21.657 --> 01:05:28.438]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:05:30.379 --> 01:05:33.619]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:36.380]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:05:38.735 --> 01:05:42.737]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:05:43.457 --> 01:05:48.140]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:50.421]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:05:50.681 --> 01:05:52.182]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:05:52.462 --> 01:05:55.043]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:05:55.343 --> 01:06:01.607]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:06:01.967 --> 01:06:04.188]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:06:04.668 --> 01:06:07.830]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it, others don't.
[01:06:10.262 --> 01:06:11.303]  In the near future.
[01:06:11.603 --> 01:06:15.746]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:06:16.086 --> 01:06:17.107]  Security alert.
[01:06:17.327 --> 01:06:19.089]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:06:19.329 --> 01:06:19.949]  Analysis.
[01:06:20.209 --> 01:06:20.870]  InfoWars.
[01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:22.891]  Building independent media operations.
[01:06:22.912 --> 01:06:27.895]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:06:27.915 --> 01:06:28.856]  Prime Directive.
[01:06:28.956 --> 01:06:30.397]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:06:30.497 --> 01:06:33.279]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:06:33.339 --> 01:06:36.462]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:06:36.582 --> 01:06:38.823]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:06:38.883 --> 01:06:39.624]  These people are a
[01:06:39.804 --> 01:06:46.828]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:06:46.889 --> 01:06:48.850]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:50.191]  You can feel it.
[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:10.481]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[01:07:10.801 --> 01:07:14.582]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[01:07:15.343 --> 01:07:19.664]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[01:07:19.804 --> 01:07:26.607]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[01:07:27.107 --> 01:07:36.171]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:07:36.411 --> 01:07:41.815]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[01:07:41.955 --> 01:07:49.219]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:51.841]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:07:52.121 --> 01:07:57.285]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game changer that also supports the InfoWar.

[01:08:14.077 --> 01:08:17.419]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:20.250 --> 01:08:22.712]  Well, you really can't make stuff up like this.
[01:08:22.813 --> 01:08:29.278]  I've got an article up on InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and the mainstream media TV video report about it.
[01:08:29.718 --> 01:08:33.682]  England is looking at restricting knives, banning people basically having butcher knives.
[01:08:34.522 --> 01:08:36.664]  They proposed this before, but now it's moving ahead.
[01:08:37.185 --> 01:08:41.028]  Laws to ban citizens having knives because we need to stop stabbings.
[01:08:42.109 --> 01:08:45.792]  Anybody can make a knife in a matter of minutes with household tools.
[01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:50.141]  You can bash somebody's brains out with thousands of things.
[01:08:50.221 --> 01:08:53.523]  A brick, a rolling pin, a hammer.
[01:08:55.263 --> 01:08:57.844]  Thousands of people a year get killed by hammers in the US.
[01:08:58.244 --> 01:08:59.025]  Gonna ban hammers?
[01:08:59.645 --> 01:09:03.087]  Just amazing that they can convince the public.
[01:09:03.207 --> 01:09:05.187]  How about they chop our hands off?
[01:09:05.848 --> 01:09:07.668]  Because people use their hands to hold weapons.
[01:09:08.689 --> 01:09:11.430]  How about we just kill everybody so that people stop committing murder?
[01:09:12.150 --> 01:09:13.391]  This is the logic.
[01:09:13.811 --> 01:09:15.552]  If there are no more humans, we will have peace.
[01:09:16.656 --> 01:09:18.597]  Sounds like something Emperor Palpatine would say.
[01:09:21.758 --> 01:09:26.299]  We have Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs both reporting from Ferguson, Missouri.
[01:09:26.319 --> 01:09:45.246]  If Joe Biggs is ready, we're going to finish up with Jakari and then go to Joe Biggs here in just a moment to talk about Delta Force that he videotaped Sunday and shot photos of with Jakari outside the Justice Center, aka courthouse, there at the county seat.
[01:09:46.531 --> 01:09:53.456]  And then coming up, I'm going to go through all the latest on this because most experts agree we're going to see more rioting tonight.
[01:09:54.057 --> 01:10:07.146]  The big issue for me, Jakari, is that if they continue to hype this and continue to have the police now stand down, even as they're getting shot at and bullets are bouncing around and they're shooting at firefighters and their fire trucks,
[01:10:08.127 --> 01:10:32.589]  If they don't go and identify who's doing this, the police intelligence units who could easily see what's happening with their binoculars and surveillance, if they don't swarm in and start grabbing the bad guys that are giving the protesters a bad name, then this is going to escalate and be a free fire zone for criminals to continue to kill people like they killed one person last night driving in their car, probably racially motivated.
[01:10:33.584 --> 01:10:39.649]  If that continues, it will spread to other parts of the country, and I think that's what the Justice Department wants.
[01:10:39.689 --> 01:10:42.812]  They ship guns to Mexico to destabilize it, and blame the Second Amendment.
[01:10:43.012 --> 01:10:44.173]  That killed 100,000 people.
[01:10:44.553 --> 01:10:46.755]  The overall drug war has in the last seven, eight years.
[01:10:47.355 --> 01:10:48.957]  Thousands of them from Fast and Furious.
[01:10:48.997 --> 01:10:50.618]  So, we know this goes on.
[01:10:50.658 --> 01:10:53.540]  They made the announcement at a key time to exacerbate it.
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:59.105]  We have the live stream footage that you and others got, that as soon as the verdict comes out, people start running.
[01:11:00.751 --> 01:11:03.274]  from the demonstration area to set things on fire.
[01:11:03.954 --> 01:11:07.758]  Black-owned businesses, white-owned businesses, Mexican food restaurants looted and torched.
[01:11:08.519 --> 01:11:14.965]  I mean, what type of evil person wants to burn down a neighborhood of random people
[01:11:16.261 --> 01:11:18.602]  I mean, I can even see the stupidness of racially motivated.
[01:11:18.622 --> 01:11:21.643]  If you think, you know, it's whites doing it to you, go burn down a white business.
[01:11:21.663 --> 01:11:26.946]  That's still stupid, bigoted, like the Klan, you know, killing some innocent black person or burning down their church.
[01:11:27.506 --> 01:11:31.768]  But I just really don't get, go burn down a black-owned business.
[01:11:31.808 --> 01:11:36.670]  It just seems so mindless and just seems like total criminals taking advantage of this.
[01:11:36.730 --> 01:11:45.394]  Jakari, do you agree with me or what's your view on how bad this might get and this could spread to other parts of the country?
[01:11:46.929 --> 01:11:54.112]  Yeah, we hear a lot of chatter of people talking about they want to have a similar thing in LA and Chicago, many other areas as well.
[01:11:54.472 --> 01:11:58.733]  As far as burning down the businesses and looting the businesses, we talked to a couple of the shopkeepers.
[01:11:58.793 --> 01:12:06.476]  It's in that video that you guys have, you know, immediately after the looting happened and the people who got looted didn't have their businesses boarded.
[01:12:06.912 --> 01:12:08.654]  And we asked him, we said, why didn't you board your business?
[01:12:08.694 --> 01:12:10.295]  I said, we had faith in this community.
[01:12:10.556 --> 01:12:11.697]  We trusted our neighbors.
[01:12:12.017 --> 01:12:13.178]  And this is what happened to us.
[01:12:13.539 --> 01:12:20.485]  And once again, a lot of the people who came in here to do the looting, they were, you know, outside provocateurs and all that, but their businesses were damaged.
[01:12:20.525 --> 01:12:27.092]  Nonetheless, we talked to a lady who works in a barbershop, also a man who owned a store right across the street that sold wireless
[01:12:27.692 --> 01:12:31.915]  Well, I cover it, Jakari, in my film from 2000, Police State 2 The Takeover, my second in the Police State series.
[01:12:31.935 --> 01:12:34.116]  I show the police being interviewed.
[01:12:34.136 --> 01:12:36.578]  I even show the newscast and news articles and the eyewitnesses.
[01:12:56.932 --> 01:13:18.446]  That Delta Force was there, running security, and that the White House was in command of hundreds of anarchists, who were brought in out of a university in Oregon, and then housed and protected, and they were allowed to loot Nike Town, they were allowed to attack, the cops were ordered to stand down, be hit by bottles and stuff, for the TV cameras.
[01:13:18.746 --> 01:13:21.268]  Now the cops didn't know what was going on, later they spoke out.
[01:13:22.008 --> 01:13:25.651]  Then they were turned loose on the peaceful 60,000 demonstrators a day later,
[01:13:26.744 --> 01:13:28.225]  And went out and attacked everybody.
[01:13:29.165 --> 01:13:30.286]  So that's what's being done here.
[01:13:30.686 --> 01:13:35.528]  They're going to let some cops get shot, let some firefighters get shot, let some shopkeepers get killed.
[01:13:36.008 --> 01:13:37.609]  People are going to say, you better do something.
[01:13:37.989 --> 01:13:43.892]  And then they're going to go after all the demonstrators, people, period, and sell the message that the First Amendment leads to violence.
[01:13:44.232 --> 01:13:45.232]  So we've got to get rid of it.
[01:13:45.652 --> 01:13:47.293]  And that includes free speech online.
[01:13:47.573 --> 01:13:48.694]  We've got to curtail this.
[01:13:49.594 --> 01:13:54.017]  Or it causes crises, it causes flash mobs, it causes Arab Springs.
[01:13:54.738 --> 01:14:04.685]  When we know it was Google came out two years after and bragged that they met in north of London at the same hotel where they had Bilderberg a year later.
[01:14:05.666 --> 01:14:11.487]  And that they planned the Arab Spring, and how to only let certain groups get traction on Facebook and Twitter.
[01:14:11.727 --> 01:14:16.489]  See, the globalists run these big global platforms, and then during key times, they steer things.
[01:14:17.109 --> 01:14:18.729]  Now, is the average cop bad in Egypt?
[01:14:18.789 --> 01:14:18.989]  No.
[01:14:19.289 --> 01:14:20.749]  Is the average cop bad in Ferguson?
[01:14:20.789 --> 01:14:20.990]  No.
[01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:23.770]  They're just the rubber meeting the road of the PSYOP.
[01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:24.630]  They don't know either.
[01:14:25.771 --> 01:14:26.871]  Ja'kar, your take on that?
[01:14:27.851 --> 01:14:28.571]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:14:28.591 --> 01:14:31.672]  You know, a lot of the guys out here, they were much better behaved last night.
[01:14:32.079 --> 01:14:32.319]  I think so.
[01:14:47.748 --> 01:14:50.051]  They had the riots and the looting going on.
[01:14:50.111 --> 01:14:52.574]  Many of the businesses got looted along this street.
[01:14:52.835 --> 01:14:58.242]  And then they came in the next couple days with the MRAPs, and that's when you saw the guys pointing guns at people in the crowd and doing all that.
[01:14:58.282 --> 01:14:59.904]  So I think there will be a similar thing.
[01:15:00.184 --> 01:15:05.852]  They'll come out with a more, with a harder hand and deal with people a little more harshly tonight, I would expect.
[01:15:07.501 --> 01:15:12.045]  All right, Jakari, I know that Joe's having to secure the vehicle because a bunch of media's now come to the site we're here at.
[01:15:12.565 --> 01:15:13.746]  That's kind of how media does.
[01:15:13.786 --> 01:15:15.628]  They flock and kind of start stacking up.
[01:15:15.928 --> 01:15:21.472]  So we'll talk to him about the military Delta Force, folks, that he got video of with you coming up later.
[01:15:22.273 --> 01:15:25.236]  Go get some sleep, get some rest, as much as you can for tonight.
[01:15:25.796 --> 01:15:33.903]  And we'll have more epic coverage, real journalism with live streaming, not edited, so everybody can make their own decision tonight.
[01:15:34.603 --> 01:15:37.826]  Starting at dark at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:15:38.227 --> 01:15:56.043]  Normally you've got to be a subscriber to see the nightly news, but we're going to have that up as a free feed again tonight, both off our PrisonPlanet.tv feed and off of your Ustream live feed as backup tonight, 7 o'clock Central Standard Time, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:15:56.123 --> 01:15:57.705]  Thank you so much, Sha'Carri Jackson.
[01:15:58.225 --> 01:15:58.866]  Alright, thank you, Alex.
[01:15:59.605 --> 01:16:01.186]  Folks, it's your chance now.
[01:16:01.627 --> 01:16:06.210]  You've heard for an hour and 15 minutes my view, Jakari's view, Joe's view.
[01:16:07.131 --> 01:16:11.814]  I want to hear your view coming up in the next segment.
[01:16:13.776 --> 01:16:17.839]  Can anyone defend mindlessly shooting at firefighters?
[01:16:20.001 --> 01:16:26.506]  Even if you've been wronged by the police and hate the police, if somebody commits a crime against you who looks a certain way,
[01:16:27.639 --> 01:16:28.719]  Where's a blue uniform?
[01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:30.000]  Just like skin color.
[01:16:31.901 --> 01:16:35.202]  And are you just going to shoot another random cop because some cop beat you up?
[01:16:36.703 --> 01:16:41.165]  This is how you get anarchy and it's a Psy-Op.
[01:16:41.445 --> 01:16:45.607]  We're all being played off against each other and this broadcast is all about stopping that.
[01:16:46.007 --> 01:16:48.648]  It's all about getting outside the box, seeing the big picture.
[01:16:49.228 --> 01:16:52.009]  You don't have to believe what I say or what I think is going on.
[01:16:52.029 --> 01:16:54.330]  A lot of the time I'm throwing out the pieces here.
[01:16:54.670 --> 01:16:56.071]  I don't know exactly what's going on.
[01:16:57.521 --> 01:17:09.824]  I know there's all the signs of the globalists, through the federal government, trying to divide this country and trying to destabilize this nation as a pretext for the National Stability Police Force that the Rand Corporation and the Pentagon want to set up.
[01:17:12.444 --> 01:17:19.426]  I want to get your take, especially if you are in Missouri or in Ferguson, you go to the head of the line.
[01:17:20.222 --> 01:17:24.469]  Or if you're in another major urban area and have seen any looting that the media hasn't covered.
[01:17:24.489 --> 01:17:26.533]  Because there's some sporadic reports of that coming in.
[01:17:26.873 --> 01:17:29.678]  The way this is being hyped, why would they want to hype this?
[01:17:29.958 --> 01:17:33.585]  Why would they make the announcement right at dark or, you know, 8.03 central?
[01:17:35.729 --> 01:17:36.710]  A couple hours after dark.
[01:17:37.190 --> 01:17:38.691]  Prime way to create hysteria.
[01:17:39.151 --> 01:17:41.272]  Prime way to exacerbate tensions.
[01:17:41.913 --> 01:17:43.033]  I want to get your take.
[01:17:43.113 --> 01:17:44.594]  Here is the toll-free number.
[01:17:44.614 --> 01:17:44.975]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:17:44.995 --> 01:17:45.115]  800-259-9231.
[01:17:45.135 --> 01:17:47.396]  And what is Ferguson diverting from?
[01:17:47.436 --> 01:17:48.777]  The giant amnesty legislation.
[01:18:00.014 --> 01:18:10.192]  The fact that the president's acting unilaterally, the fact that a lawsuit's been filed on Obamacare, saying he's overstretched his executive power, that ties into the whole immigration situation.
[01:18:12.581 --> 01:18:14.002]  Trying to destabilize Russia.
[01:18:14.642 --> 01:18:16.263]  What's happening with currencies worldwide?
[01:18:16.443 --> 01:18:17.984]  That's a two-part question for listeners.
[01:18:18.384 --> 01:18:19.625]  What's your take on Ferguson?
[01:18:19.865 --> 01:18:21.005]  How bad do you think it will get?
[01:18:21.025 --> 01:18:23.186]  Do you think our analysis is incorrect?
[01:18:23.587 --> 01:18:25.328]  We're just trying to state the facts here, what we see.
[01:18:25.348 --> 01:18:25.388]  800-259-9231.
[01:18:31.135 --> 01:18:33.618]  But the way I look at it, it's like that old cheesy show, Dragnet.
[01:18:33.938 --> 01:18:35.841]  Dun-dun-dun, just the facts.
[01:18:36.441 --> 01:18:45.673]  We're just looking at what's historically going on here, indexing it with past activities, and the playbook of the globalists, and the fact that Delta Force is on the ground.
[01:18:46.994 --> 01:18:50.619]  Time and time again, they will run PSYOPs for the president.
[01:18:52.093 --> 01:19:00.641]  And they'll have psychiatrists behind the scenes, sociologists and anthropologists, and they'll tell the Delta Force, as their mouthpiece, what to go out and what to say and what to do.
[01:19:01.342 --> 01:19:08.209]  When they got rid of the FBI hostage rescue team and got rid of all the Lon Horiyuchi and the rest of them at Waco, who came in to do the final deal?
[01:19:08.249 --> 01:19:08.869]  Delta Force.
[01:19:09.730 --> 01:19:10.591]  Who did Seattle?
[01:19:10.651 --> 01:19:11.312]  Delta Force.
[01:19:12.213 --> 01:19:16.537]  Did the little idiot anarchists, you know, flown in out of Oregon know they were part of a government operation?
[01:19:18.254 --> 01:19:19.455]  Well, we are paid by the government.
[01:19:19.475 --> 01:19:20.115]  We are protected.
[01:19:20.135 --> 01:19:21.016]  We don't work for the government.
[01:19:21.376 --> 01:19:21.877]  Yes, you do.
[01:19:23.538 --> 01:19:26.060]  So we're exposing all of this, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:35.607]  And this is a replay of 1992 riots all over again that could really get out of hand nationwide and be used as a pretext to make the public beg for tyranny.
[01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:44.278]  And the epic photo that Joe Biggs got with all of the riot police with Season's Greetings hanging over them, an InfoWars.com photo.
[01:19:44.899 --> 01:19:53.909]  We need to get our watermarks on those and get those out on InfoWars.com and on Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and all other transmission points.
[01:19:54.269 --> 01:19:55.891]  Robert in Michigan.
[01:19:55.951 --> 01:19:56.592]  Ben in St.
[01:19:56.612 --> 01:19:57.272]  Louis, Missouri.
[01:19:57.653 --> 01:19:58.474]  Clint in Michigan.
[01:19:59.488 --> 01:20:00.248]  And a lot of others.
[01:20:00.268 --> 01:20:01.668]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:20:01.688 --> 01:20:02.449]  800-259-9231.
[01:20:02.489 --> 01:20:09.110]  Live coverage from the ground in Ferguson continues.
[01:20:09.670 --> 01:20:12.291]  This holiday season, give the gift that keeps on giving.
[01:20:12.311 --> 01:20:14.911]  An in-home freeze-dryer from Harvest Right.
[01:20:15.271 --> 01:20:19.472]  With your very own freeze-dryer, you'll be able to freeze-dry the food your family loves.

[01:20:29.574 --> 01:20:30.876]  Or in 25 years.
[01:20:31.156 --> 01:20:35.641]  Go to HarvestRight.com and find out how you can get your in-home freeze dryer.
[01:20:35.941 --> 01:20:37.223]  Layaway is available.
[01:20:37.283 --> 01:20:38.945]  That's HarvestRight.com.
[01:20:39.465 --> 01:20:43.270]  Digestive health is key to wellness and Pro-EM 1 is the key to digestive health.
[01:20:43.410 --> 01:20:44.391]  Pro-EM 1 is a
[01:20:44.411 --> 01:20:44.631]  I think.
[01:21:09.332 --> 01:21:11.614]  What good is a Big Berkey water filter?
[01:21:12.234 --> 01:21:15.496]  We get that question a lot here at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[01:21:15.776 --> 01:21:17.558]  And in a word, the answer is protection.
[01:21:17.918 --> 01:21:26.944]  Protection from water main breaks, E. coli contamination, environmental chemical spills, pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell, and all forms of fluoride.
[01:21:27.224 --> 01:21:32.868]  Plus, Big Berkey water filters are the original gravity water filter system and most trusted on the market for a reason.

[01:22:08.948 --> 01:22:11.530]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:22:11.790 --> 01:22:16.654]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:22:16.894 --> 01:22:24.780]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:25.021 --> 01:22:29.324]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[01:22:29.544 --> 01:22:33.347]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:22:33.507 --> 01:22:39.230]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:22:39.450 --> 01:22:42.231]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:22:42.632 --> 01:22:47.794]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[01:23:10.625 --> 01:23:12.986]  You must be gone on vacation for a while.
[01:23:13.226 --> 01:23:14.466]  Thanks for all the jewelry.

[01:24:27.933 --> 01:24:33.594]  Ken, Neil, Robert, Ben, Clint, I'm going to all of you at the start of the next segment.
[01:24:33.634 --> 01:24:34.575]  This is a short segment.
[01:24:34.595 --> 01:24:37.455]  I want to get some of these clips out of the way that are so important.
[01:24:37.475 --> 01:24:39.116]  This just broke in the last few hours.
[01:24:40.216 --> 01:24:44.077]  It's online right now at InfoWars.com as one of the top
[01:24:45.094 --> 01:24:59.119]  We've got stories, and this only adds to the mounting pile of evidence that this is a federal shy-op to get this out of control as a political diversion so Obama can get all his executive orders through if they can get rioting breaking out around the country.
[01:24:59.579 --> 01:25:06.961]  The good news was the Justice Department got caught last year in Florida, now two years ago, trying to get the Zimmerman thing going.
[01:25:07.141 --> 01:25:09.202]  They got caught by alternative media.
[01:25:10.302 --> 01:25:11.643]  They've been caught trying to do that here.
[01:25:13.092 --> 01:25:17.154]  And now, grand jury decision has come out.
[01:25:17.194 --> 01:25:18.195]  We've seen the aftermath.
[01:25:18.215 --> 01:25:19.696]  It's probably going to get a lot worse tonight.
[01:25:19.716 --> 01:25:21.757]  We've got reporters on the ground to cover it.
[01:25:23.037 --> 01:25:28.160]  And we now have two shocking clips that are up on Infowars.com.
[01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:29.201]  Official.
[01:25:30.401 --> 01:25:34.904]  Obama ordered National Guard stand down during Ferguson riots.
[01:25:35.244 --> 01:25:35.964]  Unbelievable.
[01:25:36.464 --> 01:25:39.106]  Make the announcement at 8 o'clock at night, an hour and a half after dark.
[01:25:42.182 --> 01:25:43.482]  Have the police stand down.
[01:25:44.282 --> 01:25:45.543]  Demonize the First Amendment.
[01:25:46.443 --> 01:25:47.483]  Let a cop get shot.
[01:25:47.523 --> 01:25:48.683]  Let a citizen get killed.
[01:25:51.044 --> 01:25:51.644]  Unbelievable.
[01:25:52.024 --> 01:25:56.405]  Missouri Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder says National Guard was deployed to St.
[01:25:56.445 --> 01:26:00.506]  Louis but was told to stand down in Ferguson by Obama administration.
[01:26:01.626 --> 01:26:03.527]  Since when is the governor not in charge?
[01:26:03.547 --> 01:26:04.927]  Remember he wouldn't say he was in charge?
[01:26:07.264 --> 01:26:09.526]  Remember, remember the governor last week, wouldn't say he was in charge?
[01:26:10.047 --> 01:26:14.091]  The Ferguson mayor, James Knowles, says requests for National Guard were turned down.
[01:26:14.331 --> 01:26:19.937]  That's two officials, if you want to use that word, saying they were ordered to stand down.
[01:26:20.037 --> 01:26:21.018]  Clearly there's a stand down.
[01:26:23.921 --> 01:26:28.125]  How about you stand down shooting reporters and never stand down to looters or people shooting at you?
[01:26:29.298 --> 01:26:33.201]  I think that's illegal, by the way, to let people run around and just shoot at firefighters and burn things down.
[01:26:33.861 --> 01:26:37.924]  Missouri governor, Jay Nixon, stumbles on Ferguson responsibility question.
[01:26:38.304 --> 01:26:39.425]  ABC News, remember that?
[01:26:41.967 --> 01:26:45.969]  Yeah, Obama's running this whole deal, and they're tinker-toying it.
[01:26:45.989 --> 01:26:49.572]  They're seeing if they can get an uprising going, which they can then be the saviors to.
[01:26:51.806 --> 01:26:54.267]  And the police and the citizens are being played off against each other.
[01:26:54.587 --> 01:26:55.347]  That's the PSYOP.
[01:26:55.367 --> 01:26:59.449]  That's why we can't let them start the civil war I've been warning about ad nauseum.
[01:26:59.709 --> 01:27:03.751]  Here's a lieutenant governor on Obama ordering a stand down.
[01:27:04.131 --> 01:27:05.271]  Why do we even have governors?
[01:27:05.611 --> 01:27:06.852]  Why do we have lieutenant governors?
[01:27:07.132 --> 01:27:08.092]  Why do we have states?
[01:27:08.393 --> 01:27:09.493]  Why do we have state police?
[01:27:09.753 --> 01:27:10.813]  Why do we have local police?
[01:27:11.074 --> 01:27:12.234]  Why do we have dog catchers?
[01:27:12.514 --> 01:27:14.215]  Why shouldn't everything just be federal?
[01:27:14.795 --> 01:27:16.056]  Because it basically already is.
[01:27:16.256 --> 01:27:16.637]  Here it is.
[01:27:34.741 --> 01:27:39.644]  We know that they were kept away because they did not come in and stop that from the get-go.
[01:27:40.064 --> 01:27:42.406]  They were deployed at other parts of the St.
[01:27:42.446 --> 01:27:43.066]  Louis region.
[01:27:43.146 --> 01:27:43.967]  In the city of St.
[01:27:44.007 --> 01:27:50.771]  Louis, Mayor Slay had them at a couple of different, I mean, a couple of dozen different locations, I'm told.
[01:27:51.211 --> 01:27:52.411]  Maybe other parts of St.
[01:27:52.431 --> 01:27:52.992]  Louis County.
[01:27:53.372 --> 01:27:59.756]  Why were they not in there at the first sign of an overturned police car or a smashed police car window
[01:28:00.436 --> 01:28:03.079]  With a show of force that would have stopped this.
[01:28:03.159 --> 01:28:05.541]  And here's my question that the governor must answer.
[01:28:06.242 --> 01:28:14.489]  Is the reason that the National Guard was not in there because the Obama administration and the Holder Justice Department leaned on you to keep them out?
[01:28:15.190 --> 01:28:22.417]  I cannot imagine any other reason why the governor who mobilized the National Guard would not have them in there to stop this.
[01:28:23.658 --> 01:28:24.919]  That's right, that's what's going on.
[01:28:24.979 --> 01:28:26.780]  Missouri Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder.
[01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:31.964]  Let's go to the Ferguson Mayor, James Knowles, saying the request was turned down.
[01:28:32.464 --> 01:28:32.784]  Boom!
[01:28:33.225 --> 01:28:34.045]  Somebody's behind it.
[01:28:34.145 --> 01:28:35.867]  It's clearly the Obama administration.
[01:28:36.087 --> 01:28:40.710]  You can bet your bottom dollar that's who's in control with the Delta Force of the whole situation.
[01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:41.250]  Let's go to it.
[01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:44.853]  Unfortunately, I know I've been on the phone in contact with
[01:28:45.313 --> 01:28:59.040]  The county executive's office, I know he has requested, I am requesting, have requested the National Guard troops to come out from the command post to help restore order along the business district.
[01:29:00.101 --> 01:29:01.182]  We have not seen that.
[01:29:02.182 --> 01:29:10.827]  It's my understanding that the commanders out on the streets have requested this and those calls have gone unheeded at this point.
[01:29:11.534 --> 01:29:20.580]  So, at this point, unless we can get the current situation stabilized, right now it doesn't appear that there's any end in sight.
[01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:27.445]  And we need to have the governor step up, give us the resources that he's promised from the beginning.
[01:29:27.465 --> 01:29:33.069]  He stated that he would have a strong response if the resources necessary would be provided.
[01:29:33.089 --> 01:29:35.390]  They have not been provided so far.
[01:29:35.871 --> 01:29:37.211]  We need that right now.
[01:29:38.326 --> 01:29:39.827]  And guaranteed, it's Obama.
[01:29:39.867 --> 01:29:45.309]  That's who is in control of the National Guard, countrywide, under the new Homeland Security rules.
[01:29:45.709 --> 01:29:47.210]  Governors are more vestigial.
[01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:51.671]  They could announce and reclaim their state power, but they don't.
[01:29:52.752 --> 01:29:53.972]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:54.072 --> 01:29:55.033]  Your calls are straight ahead.
[01:29:55.093 --> 01:29:56.133]  Infowars.com.
[01:29:58.734 --> 01:29:59.635]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.135 --> 01:30:01.735]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.656 --> 01:30:05.337]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.622 --> 01:30:19.149]  Using unparalleled research and the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:30:19.289 --> 01:30:29.056]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:30:29.216 --> 01:30:32.138]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[01:30:32.338 --> 01:30:32.959]  I think so.
[01:30:47.295 --> 01:30:47.555]  We're good.
[01:31:09.881 --> 01:31:13.382]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:31:13.542 --> 01:31:17.503]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:31:17.824 --> 01:31:19.264]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:31:19.604 --> 01:31:27.166]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:31:27.447 --> 01:31:28.307]  But for how long?
[01:31:28.587 --> 01:31:30.588]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com.
[01:31:30.808 --> 01:31:34.869]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L bodyarmor.com.
[01:31:35.229 --> 01:31:36.389]  Infidel Body Armor.
[01:31:37.110 --> 01:31:38.050]  Just won't quit.
[01:31:39.645 --> 01:31:43.486]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[01:31:44.246 --> 01:31:50.508]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.

[01:32:09.301 --> 01:32:15.582]  When I first got online and I seen the price of the X2 and the DNA Force, I was a little hesitant, but I pulled the trigger on it.
[01:32:15.702 --> 01:32:16.683]  It has changed my life.
[01:32:16.703 --> 01:32:18.803]  I've been taking it for about 24 days now.
[01:32:18.883 --> 01:32:20.243]  Counting the weights, staying in shape.
[01:32:20.403 --> 01:32:22.844]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:22.944 --> 01:32:24.384]  You've heard the callers to the show.
[01:32:24.404 --> 01:32:28.345]  Several months back, I started taking your nascent iodine and your super meal.
[01:32:28.405 --> 01:32:30.285]  Prior to this, I was barely walking.
[01:32:30.385 --> 01:32:33.046]  Now I'm able to function as a human again.
[01:32:33.166 --> 01:32:51.056]  Whether it's Survival Shield Nascent Iodine or DNA Force, Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality, Lung Cleanse, Fluoride Shield, Oxy Powder, I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:51.096 --> 01:32:56.358]  They actually do just amazing what it's able to do to actually detox the body.
[01:32:56.678 --> 01:32:57.519]  It's great stuff.
[01:32:57.619 --> 01:32:58.479]  I'm gonna promote something.
[01:32:58.499 --> 01:33:01.300]  It's gotta be something I personally use and that I believe in.

[01:33:10.223 --> 01:33:10.824]  Another world.
[01:33:10.904 --> 01:33:11.824]  Another time.
[01:33:11.904 --> 01:33:12.804]  In the age of one.
[01:33:36.948 --> 01:33:40.850]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:41.571 --> 01:33:47.634]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:34:06.889 --> 01:34:09.090]  Hey, look at the top of DrudgeReport.com.
[01:34:11.212 --> 01:34:15.354]  It's got the same photo that Joe Biggs got, or maybe somebody else took a similar one.
[01:34:15.994 --> 01:34:17.095]  Seasons Greetings.
[01:34:18.776 --> 01:34:20.277]  Ferguson businesses burned.
[01:34:20.837 --> 01:34:23.558]  Police cars torched.
[01:34:28.021 --> 01:34:28.801]  That's the article.
[01:34:30.622 --> 01:34:34.265]  I'm trying to go to the article, but stupid pop-up on the St.
[01:34:34.285 --> 01:34:34.565]  Louis
[01:34:35.728 --> 01:34:37.229]  Post-Dispatch, shut it down.
[01:34:37.249 --> 01:34:44.893]  I tell you, even with Macs now, they're just coming up with pop-ups that are just invincible.
[01:34:45.673 --> 01:34:47.274]  They're so incredibly annoying.
[01:34:49.295 --> 01:34:51.897]  We're going to be taking your phone calls here in just a moment.
[01:34:52.717 --> 01:34:56.800]  Missouri Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder says National Guard was deployed in St.
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:58.781]  Louis but was told to stand down in Ferguson.
[01:34:59.381 --> 01:35:03.003]  He believes, by the Obama administration, the mayor is saying the same thing.
[01:35:03.624 --> 01:35:04.664]  Well, they're just waiting.
[01:35:04.804 --> 01:35:09.927]  Obama is, so then they can send them in when the public begs for the police state.
[01:35:10.188 --> 01:35:13.350]  But it has to get out of control first before that can be done.
[01:35:14.270 --> 01:35:16.072]  Or it may be worse than what they've done in the past.
[01:35:16.452 --> 01:35:19.234]  This is a standard procedure to promote a police state.
[01:35:19.835 --> 01:35:20.895]  It may be worse than that.
[01:35:21.256 --> 01:35:36.307]  They may be wanting to stir it up all over the country as a destabilization program inside the United States to bring in even more tyranny and to become a political distraction from all the different things Obama is up to and what they are doing.
[01:35:37.649 --> 01:35:38.869]  Now I've given the phone number out.
[01:35:38.889 --> 01:35:40.070]  The phone lines are loaded.
[01:35:40.671 --> 01:35:42.913]  I want to take your phone calls.
[01:35:44.065 --> 01:35:48.466]  And I want to get your take on this, but also what is this diverting from?
[01:35:49.067 --> 01:35:51.947]  Because clearly it's distracting from a whole host of issues.
[01:35:52.808 --> 01:35:58.949]  But couldn't the race baiters at MSNBC or others pick a better poster person, a better poster child than Brown?
[01:36:01.226 --> 01:36:13.093]  From all the reports we've gotten was a big oversized thug who liked to thug around and was, you know, minutes before he was killed, shaking down the little shopkeeper, stealing some cigars.
[01:36:13.813 --> 01:36:16.835]  And people say, oh big deal, you know, you shouldn't die for that.
[01:36:17.736 --> 01:36:18.016]  Listen!
[01:36:19.076 --> 01:36:20.738]  You reckless drive, you're gonna die.
[01:36:20.758 --> 01:36:25.305]  I mean, you go out and attack a cop and then run back and charge him again, you're gonna get shot.
[01:36:25.866 --> 01:36:28.609]  And I'm not saying that's a good thing that he got shot and dead.
[01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:32.755]  I don't get off on a black guy being dead and I'm all, oh right, shoot that black guy.
[01:36:33.216 --> 01:36:34.498]  That's not my view on this.
[01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:37.701]  But I reject the police state.
[01:36:37.961 --> 01:36:42.162]  I also reject the thug culture promoted by MTV and the rest of it.
[01:36:42.942 --> 01:36:43.982]  As a political weapon.
[01:36:44.022 --> 01:36:47.803]  We're going to air a special hard-hitting report on that at the bottom of the next hour.
[01:36:47.823 --> 01:36:50.404]  But right now, without further ado, I'm going to go to Clint.
[01:36:51.224 --> 01:36:54.045]  Then I'm going to go to Ben and Robert and Neil and Ken.
[01:36:54.525 --> 01:36:55.245]  One after the other.
[01:36:55.285 --> 01:36:57.806]  And as each person hangs up, that's your chance to call in 800-259-9231.
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:11.823]  I'm predicting riots twice as big as what we saw last night, and I think it's a safe bet you will see some other events around the country.
[01:37:12.403 --> 01:37:16.765]  Hopefully, though, this will become a dud like the Trayvon Martin race baiting.
[01:37:17.405 --> 01:37:18.785]  Because what else does Obama have?
[01:37:18.825 --> 01:37:22.166]  The globalists are taking black people's future more than anybody else's.
[01:37:22.647 --> 01:37:24.587]  Their unemployment is at record levels.
[01:37:25.347 --> 01:37:26.868]  Basically doubled under Obozo.
[01:37:29.693 --> 01:37:30.854]  And again, I call him a bozo.
[01:37:30.894 --> 01:37:31.934]  It's an ad-hoc attack.
[01:37:31.974 --> 01:37:32.854]  He's no bozo at all.
[01:37:33.095 --> 01:37:37.036]  He's a corporate front man doing exactly what he was put in there to do.
[01:37:37.397 --> 01:37:45.100]  Create division while the banksters rob this country and de-industrialize us and then play us off against each other while they're doing that.
[01:37:46.501 --> 01:37:47.941]  Clinton, Michigan, thanks for calling.
[01:37:48.242 --> 01:37:48.942]  You're on the air.
[01:37:49.722 --> 01:37:51.083]  What's your take on the situation?
[01:37:52.003 --> 01:37:52.724]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:37:53.044 --> 01:37:53.404]  Good, brother.
[01:37:54.264 --> 01:38:01.148]  Hey, well first I want to say I think Brown was picked because he didn't, he wasn't innocent.
[01:38:01.568 --> 01:38:08.952]  If they would have picked an innocent person to use, I think people would have rallied around the protesters and said, oh this, you know, I see why they're doing it.
[01:38:09.012 --> 01:38:16.776]  Now they pick a guy who clearly was at wrong in what he did, so therefore you don't have those people rallying around those protesters.
[01:38:16.796 --> 01:38:17.776]  But my question is, is
[01:38:19.747 --> 01:38:23.651]  You know, obviously it's clear today that it's an inside job.
[01:38:23.671 --> 01:38:26.713]  You've got people manipulating it all over the place.
[01:38:26.733 --> 01:38:29.316]  You know, they pick 7 o'clock to air it and everything.
[01:38:30.765 --> 01:38:34.247]  Well, don't any of the local people that are involved in this see this?
[01:38:34.387 --> 01:38:35.468]  Or are they in on it?
[01:38:35.628 --> 01:38:37.069]  Do you think they're in on it?
[01:38:37.109 --> 01:38:41.031]  We've talked to a lot of locals that day one said they're trying to create a riot, trying to create division.
[01:38:41.371 --> 01:38:49.337]  That's what most, you know, the working black folks that we talk to down on the ground, you know, guys coming home from work with their John Deere hats on are mad.
[01:38:49.997 --> 01:38:58.763]  They don't like the media, they don't like what the police are doing shooting reporters, but they also know the thugs are in there piggybacking on this and being protected basically.
[01:38:59.763 --> 01:39:07.267]  I mean, again, they didn't go arrest folks shooting at the police because they were ordered to stand down.
[01:39:08.267 --> 01:39:19.892]  And what you raise about how they picked Brown, the media picked this case because they knew full well in the end it would be a winner for the establishment.
[01:39:20.613 --> 01:39:21.553]  You're absolutely right.
[01:39:21.593 --> 01:39:22.273]  Good to hear from you.
[01:39:22.594 --> 01:39:23.214]  Ben in St.
[01:39:23.254 --> 01:39:27.496]  Louis, the epicenter, what's your take on the situation?
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:32.625]  Well, I just wanted to say hello and thank you for taking my call.
[01:39:32.905 --> 01:39:37.430]  It's been a very interesting, you know, last few weeks, last few months here in St.
[01:39:37.470 --> 01:39:37.730]  Louis.
[01:39:37.770 --> 01:39:44.919]  I mean, nothing in my neighborhood got very interesting, but down in South City, over at Grand,
[01:39:45.672 --> 01:39:49.814]  You know, they were smashing windows and, you know, committing crime and all that kind of stuff.
[01:39:49.854 --> 01:40:00.818]  But the one thing that has become abundantly clear to me over this entire situation is the importance of the media and the role that the media plays in anything.
[01:40:01.459 --> 01:40:04.060]  You know, you can't, you just can't overstate that.
[01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:12.443]  You know, basically your guys being on the front lines, Joe and Jakari, have been doing a great job and have just blown this thing wide open.
[01:40:14.835 --> 01:40:34.826]  I mean, obviously, when you have the corporate controlled media, you know, figuring out which way they want the public to debate, framing the debate from the public, giving them one side or the other, you know, you eliminate any sort of chance to have a meaningful discussion about police tactics, you know, race relations, things like that.
[01:40:36.006 --> 01:40:44.231]  So, I mean, that's just the thing that has been my big takeaway from this, is just the importance of media and the role that they, you know, play.
[01:40:44.907 --> 01:40:46.649]  When situations like this happen.
[01:40:48.571 --> 01:40:53.217]  I agree with what you're saying and clearly making the decision.
[01:40:53.817 --> 01:41:01.005]  You couldn't have picked 8 o'clock when I knew the decision hours before as a worst time to make the announcement.
[01:41:01.466 --> 01:41:03.789]  If I was going to pick the absolute worst time
[01:41:05.228 --> 01:41:09.833]  An hour and a half after dark, and I would keep having the governor, and keep having the mayor come out.
[01:41:10.013 --> 01:41:11.935]  Now calm down there, and don't go crazy.
[01:41:12.135 --> 01:41:13.637]  Now hold on a minute.
[01:41:13.957 --> 01:41:15.899]  I mean, I heard that on the radio last night.
[01:41:15.919 --> 01:41:26.771]  I was driving home, and I was listening to coverage on 590 at like 5 o'clock, our local affiliate, and Jeff Ward
[01:41:28.854 --> 01:41:33.276]  The local house friend of mine, he was going, man, they're trying to hype this.
[01:41:33.516 --> 01:41:35.597]  Man, they're acting like it's a sporting event.
[01:41:36.097 --> 01:41:37.818]  They're trying to make this as bad as possible.
[01:41:38.058 --> 01:41:38.799]  Absolutely.
[01:41:40.339 --> 01:41:43.601]  Who is telling them how to announce stuff?
[01:41:43.641 --> 01:41:45.162]  I guarantee you it's the military.
[01:41:46.007 --> 01:41:49.128]  The PSYOPs, and they're there believing everything they're told.
[01:41:49.808 --> 01:41:54.089]  And again, the way PSYOPs works, is I'm not blaming the military when I say this.
[01:41:54.169 --> 01:41:55.169]  I don't mean the rank and file.
[01:41:55.949 --> 01:42:01.270]  When the President sends the Delta Force in, especially Democratic Presidents, I've noticed a pattern.
[01:42:01.650 --> 01:42:06.271]  WACO, WTO, and other events, and I've dealt with Delta Force.
[01:42:07.032 --> 01:42:09.392]  On record, I made a police state film about them.
[01:42:10.152 --> 01:42:11.753]  And got messed with.
[01:42:12.293 --> 01:42:12.993]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:42:14.161 --> 01:42:16.943]  Look, I've told the story, there's video of it, I'm not going to get into it again today.
[01:42:17.564 --> 01:42:18.525]  But it was not fun.
[01:42:19.585 --> 01:42:22.408]  Hotels broken into, shy ops, you name it.
[01:42:22.928 --> 01:42:25.370]  They just think you're not allowed to be an American and have a First Amendment.
[01:42:25.751 --> 01:42:28.993]  Because they get messages from the President and get told what to do.
[01:42:29.954 --> 01:42:30.895]  And they send them in there.
[01:42:36.045 --> 01:42:38.047]  And they then stir things up, basically.
[01:42:38.567 --> 01:42:40.409]  I mean, who would tell them, release it at 8 o'clock?
[01:42:40.749 --> 01:42:42.811]  Who would tell them, have the National Guard stand down?
[01:42:43.231 --> 01:42:45.493]  See, why wouldn't the Governor say who was in charge?
[01:42:45.993 --> 01:42:53.079]  The President is in charge, and who does the President use when they want to stir up a destabilization program?
[01:42:54.100 --> 01:42:54.720]  Delta Force.
[01:42:55.821 --> 01:42:57.042]  Who created Delta Force?
[01:42:57.162 --> 01:42:57.783]  Jimmy Carter.
[01:42:59.864 --> 01:43:01.986]  They do not even take orders from the Pentagon.
[01:43:03.647 --> 01:43:05.269]  It is a special unit
[01:43:06.271 --> 01:43:08.993]  Well, there are three squadrons, what they call them?
[01:43:09.033 --> 01:43:10.233]  Up to five squadrons now?
[01:43:11.474 --> 01:43:14.336]  And then they've got auxiliary sheep-dip groups out of Delta Force.
[01:43:14.756 --> 01:43:16.257]  They've got groups above Delta Force.
[01:43:16.877 --> 01:43:23.481]  But these are what Delta Force operators looked and acted like that Joe Biggs saw in Afghanistan and Iraq, and I've dealt with them.
[01:43:24.102 --> 01:43:30.926]  In fact, I think I've seen some of these very guys 14, 15 years ago messing around when I was doing stuff.
[01:43:32.534 --> 01:43:43.897]  And I was just trying to show urban warfare drills, because they would announce I was insane and say there are no black helicopters in San Antonio, there are no black helicopters in Kingsville, there are no black helicopters in Houston.
[01:43:44.497 --> 01:43:52.720]  And then one crashed in Houston, and we had the colonel on that runs Soldier of Fortune talking about it, and they got mad at him for even publishing it.
[01:43:53.677 --> 01:43:55.998]  They basically sent some threats to him.
[01:43:57.018 --> 01:44:03.059]  They didn't even want people to know they were doing this martial law drill acclimation operation.
[01:44:03.099 --> 01:44:08.161]  So the fact that they're involved tells me they're calling the shots.
[01:44:08.621 --> 01:44:12.202]  Because they were calling the shots in Seattle for Clinton at the WTO.
[01:44:13.582 --> 01:44:14.842]  And not just running security.
[01:44:16.023 --> 01:44:16.703]  And that's another thing.
[01:44:16.723 --> 01:44:17.523]  They'll have cutouts.
[01:44:17.583 --> 01:44:19.543]  Like they'll have regular Delta Force people there.
[01:44:19.924 --> 01:44:21.224]  They'll have Navy SEALs there.
[01:44:23.018 --> 01:44:25.841]  And then they'll have another group of mercenaries there dressed like them.
[01:44:25.861 --> 01:44:28.324]  I mean, things aren't usually even what they seem.
[01:44:34.711 --> 01:44:35.632]  Robert in Michigan.
[01:44:35.652 --> 01:44:36.172]  You're on the air.
[01:44:36.212 --> 01:44:36.773]  Thanks for holding.
[01:44:38.114 --> 01:44:38.875]  Hey, Alex.
[01:44:38.895 --> 01:44:39.536]  What's up, man?
[01:44:39.896 --> 01:44:41.098]  Worldwide broadcast, brother.
[01:44:41.118 --> 01:44:41.678]  What's going on?
[01:44:42.779 --> 01:44:43.200]  Nothing much.
[01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:43.921]  How you doing, man?
[01:44:44.101 --> 01:44:44.321]  Good.
[01:44:44.361 --> 01:44:44.922]  Thanks for calling.
[01:44:46.278 --> 01:44:46.639]  I don't know.
[01:45:04.631 --> 01:45:16.178]  After so long, just the chaos in the street, and like you said, the military, the National Guard, they weren't at the hot zones, they were defending the more important properties like the malls and they were just somewhere else.
[01:45:16.639 --> 01:45:20.941]  And just letting chaos happen, and then all of a sudden they started to matriculate to other cities.
[01:45:21.762 --> 01:45:26.905]  That's right, they let people burn down a neighborhood of hard-working, mainly black people.
[01:45:27.365 --> 01:45:29.867]  They let the looters from out of town basically do that.
[01:45:30.527 --> 01:45:37.269]  And if they would have instantly pounced on and arrested or shot people shooting at them, which you're supposed to do, it would have stopped.
[01:45:37.309 --> 01:45:39.730]  But instead, they're letting it get out of hand.
[01:45:40.410 --> 01:45:43.111]  And look, this is a PSYOP period.
[01:45:43.572 --> 01:45:45.032]  Who do you think's pulling the strings?
[01:45:47.253 --> 01:45:59.257]  It's definitely the globalists because, you know what, America is the last bastion of hope for the world, you know, from a biblical standpoint, from an economic standpoint, because the average man has a chance here in America.
[01:46:00.004 --> 01:46:08.952]  And, you know, the fact that we had the First Amendment and the Second Amendment, which is under complete attack, you know, once that goes out the window, then it's going to be all chaos, you know what I'm saying?
[01:46:08.992 --> 01:46:21.344]  And this is just another attack on the Constitution, because I'm really concerned about what's going to happen on December 24th when everyone's, you know, getting ready for the Christmas holiday, and then they're going to have some kind of U.N.
[01:46:21.364 --> 01:46:25.568]  treaties, you know, outlanding guns, you know, weapons.
[01:46:26.218 --> 01:46:33.936]  I mean, I live in Detroit, you know, it's obviously the most dangerous city in the world, but, you know, I take comfort in having protection, being able to protect my family and my home.
[01:46:35.450 --> 01:46:40.153]  The police chief, every real police officer said, hey, we really can't help you.
[01:46:40.173 --> 01:46:41.835]  There's no way they can get here faster.
[01:46:41.875 --> 01:46:42.355]  That's right.
[01:46:42.395 --> 01:46:46.658]  For the first time in years, the crime rates dropped because the police said, go get guns.
[01:46:46.698 --> 01:46:48.499]  And all these liberals went, get guns.
[01:46:48.559 --> 01:46:50.120]  They went, got guns, took classes.
[01:46:50.621 --> 01:46:52.842]  A few dozen criminals get shot in home invasions.
[01:46:53.163 --> 01:46:54.844]  Suddenly, they're not carjacking as much.
[01:46:55.144 --> 01:46:56.665]  Suddenly, they're not home invading as much.
[01:46:57.025 --> 01:46:58.086]  That's the answer.
[01:46:58.827 --> 01:47:04.671]  And remember the last six months, New York Times, everybody, Washington Post, we're a police state.
[01:47:05.211 --> 01:47:06.592]  You know, we don't need armored vehicles.
[01:47:07.072 --> 01:47:11.196]  Well now, with them getting shot at, oh, we do need armored vehicles, see?
[01:47:11.736 --> 01:47:15.359]  You can see the PSYOP, but we... The PSYOP goes further.
[01:47:16.633 --> 01:47:28.482]  They want us to now see the police as our enemy through all of this, instead of realizing they're being PSYOPed more than we are, and on average they know what's going on more than the general public does.
[01:47:29.002 --> 01:47:31.924]  The average cops understand they're being ordered to stand down.
[01:47:32.004 --> 01:47:33.645]  They know this is a PSYOP.
[01:47:33.706 --> 01:47:37.088]  They know that there's a cover-up on where the orders are coming from.
[01:47:38.009 --> 01:47:39.069]  Great to hear from you, Robert.
[01:47:39.170 --> 01:47:40.270]  In Michigan, great points.
[01:47:40.651 --> 01:47:42.672]  Let's talk to Neil in Pennsylvania.
[01:47:42.732 --> 01:47:43.613]  Neil, you're on the air.
[01:47:44.554 --> 01:47:45.694]  Hey, what's going on, Alex?
[01:47:45.934 --> 01:47:46.535]  Good to have you here.
[01:47:46.555 --> 01:47:48.095]  Go ahead.
[01:47:48.135 --> 01:47:55.297]  Quick question about wondering if how they're bringing in, like when martial law is going to start in Ferguson, obviously.
[01:47:55.317 --> 01:48:01.719]  Do you think with them having all these big protests going on across the country that it's just a
[01:48:03.287 --> 01:48:24.461]  Well, look, the Occupy Wall Street movement was funded by Soros, was funded by a bunch of globalists, but they left it open-ended at first to try to get good people to join it with legitimate beefs against corruption on Wall Street and insider trading and bid rigging and all the rest of it.
[01:48:25.970 --> 01:48:28.372]  Well, now it's the same thing here.
[01:48:28.852 --> 01:48:46.344]  They want to try to foment this and steer it and control it, and if they can get it rolling, the White House, the globalists, would love to have riots across the country to create more racial division, more destabilization, more of a pretext to roll the armored vehicles out to all the departments, right as there's a bipartisan backlash against that.
[01:48:46.744 --> 01:48:49.506]  This is being done at a key time as a beta test.
[01:48:49.526 --> 01:48:54.870]  Just like Obama said, Ebola was a beta test
[01:48:56.345 --> 01:48:59.086]  Test case for a more serious airborne thing in the future.
[01:48:59.486 --> 01:49:01.287]  They don't let a good crisis go to waste.
[01:49:01.607 --> 01:49:02.688]  They are studying this.
[01:49:03.228 --> 01:49:04.168]  They are testing this.
[01:49:04.208 --> 01:49:05.489]  They are manipulating this.
[01:49:06.089 --> 01:49:11.171]  And yes, they are certainly trying to see if they can control it.
[01:49:11.491 --> 01:49:18.935]  But as soon as they couldn't get Occupy to do what they wanted, 36 cities in one night, the feds ordered police to arrest them.
[01:49:19.235 --> 01:49:20.655]  They had FBI sniper teams.
[01:49:20.715 --> 01:49:21.616]  It was declassified.
[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:30.928]  Aiming guns, well it wasn't declassified, WikiLeaks released it, excuse me, prepared to kill the Occupy leaders.
[01:49:31.308 --> 01:49:36.814]  So they were doing that to see if cops could be briefed on, by the way, we're going to kill peaceful leaders.
[01:49:37.634 --> 01:49:44.762]  So see, it's all about seeing what they can get cops to do, seeing what they can get FBI to do, seeing what they can get Delta Force to do.
[01:49:45.876 --> 01:49:50.200]  And they put Delta Force in charge because Delta Force will do anything they're ordered to do.
[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:58.467]  They read Machiavelli, they're taught Injustifies the Means, they're taught all this squirrely stuff, and so they think it's normal.
[01:50:00.889 --> 01:50:02.490]  I mean, I'll be quite honest with you folks.
[01:50:05.313 --> 01:50:09.957]  All it would take would be a few people to start shooting some guns to get other people to start doing it as well.
[01:50:10.497 --> 01:50:12.379]  And what do you think?
[01:50:14.164 --> 01:50:14.804]  Copycat.
[01:50:14.904 --> 01:50:17.765]  Yeah, that would definitely start that up.
[01:50:18.325 --> 01:50:27.168]  I was watching the live feed last night and I was wondering about how Joe Biggs had the, I guess the cops out in the regular clothes and stuff right in front of him.
[01:50:27.188 --> 01:50:29.068]  He was kind of whispering and pointing it out.
[01:50:30.248 --> 01:50:34.210]  Any sign of the Kraft International boys up there, like from the Boston bombing?
[01:50:35.810 --> 01:50:38.931]  Well, they were wearing the hats, the Punisher hats and the uniform of Kraft.
[01:50:40.393 --> 01:50:46.236]  I know I walked into a facility, a restaurant, and there was a Kraft guy in there, and he got up and left when he saw me.
[01:50:46.256 --> 01:50:48.297]  I don't know, why are you wearing a Kraft shirt, man?
[01:50:49.318 --> 01:50:55.982]  Anyways, I don't think Kraft was involved, but they were definitely, people dressed like them were definitely there, probably as decoys.
[01:50:56.782 --> 01:50:58.803]  By the way, something really just clicked.
[01:50:59.024 --> 01:51:00.464]  We're going to talk about when we come back from break.
[01:51:01.785 --> 01:51:06.628]  There are now protesters going to the White House, in mass, over
[01:51:07.984 --> 01:51:08.965]  The Ferguson shooting.
[01:51:08.985 --> 01:51:09.685]  We're gonna break this down.
[01:51:09.705 --> 01:51:12.466]  This hour brought to you by InfidelBodyArmor.com.

[01:52:08.797 --> 01:52:10.718]  Americans, you are being lied to.
[01:52:10.938 --> 01:52:16.820]  Does your skin crawl when a politician or a stock market guru say that we are in the midst of an economic recovery?
[01:52:17.021 --> 01:52:21.042]  According to top insiders, the largest financial meltdown in history is coming.
[01:52:21.202 --> 01:52:25.224]  You can prepare, but if you're living paycheck to paycheck, how do you find the cash?
[01:52:25.524 --> 01:52:29.726]  If you're fortunate enough to have retirement savings, it's probably not enough.
[01:52:29.886 --> 01:52:33.448]  And if it's in the market, it could be wiped out just like the last crash.
[01:52:33.648 --> 01:52:36.649]  But this time it will almost certainly be much worse.
[01:52:36.929 --> 01:52:42.131]  Precious metals are a great hedge, but they won't generate immediate cash flow to pay the bills.

[01:53:13.743 --> 01:53:19.885]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:53:20.065 --> 01:53:27.027]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[01:53:27.347 --> 01:53:37.212]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[01:53:37.812 --> 01:53:43.734]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:53:43.955 --> 01:53:47.136]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and
[01:53:47.436 --> 01:53:48.537]  Adenosylcobalamin.
[01:53:48.777 --> 01:53:52.140]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:53:52.381 --> 01:53:54.002]  No needles, no injections.

[01:54:24.053 --> 01:54:40.880]  I remember hearing this last night, but then when I saw the video just now, again we simulcast video, not just audio for radio listeners, at infowars.com.
[01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:42.421]  There's a free feed every day.
[01:54:43.221 --> 01:54:51.085]  Ferguson protesters gather at White House as Darren Wilson cleared, and it looks like thousands of people
[01:54:52.822 --> 01:54:56.004]  Thousands of people, it looks like, just gathered.
[01:54:57.605 --> 01:54:59.606]  Predominantly black, but a lot of white folks.
[01:55:02.849 --> 01:55:05.390]  And they show up demanding justice.
[01:55:06.091 --> 01:55:07.632]  Is it right to rebel?
[01:55:10.153 --> 01:55:11.494]  A bunch of Democratic Party groups.
[01:55:12.675 --> 01:55:15.737]  Darren Wilson murdered Mike Brown.
[01:55:15.997 --> 01:55:16.517]  No, he didn't.
[01:55:17.018 --> 01:55:18.539]  Grand jury heard all the black witnesses.
[01:55:19.599 --> 01:55:20.580]  Black Lives Matter.
[01:55:21.060 --> 01:55:21.861]  Stop racist
[01:55:23.612 --> 01:55:24.473]  Police terror.
[01:55:27.016 --> 01:55:34.964]  Do you people understand that 52% of black people since 1973 were killed before they were born?
[01:55:36.105 --> 01:55:41.030]  Do you understand that fluoride has double the effect on black males than it has on anybody else?
[01:55:41.471 --> 01:55:46.356]  Do you realize that you are under attack, so is everybody else, by the globalists?
[01:55:48.123 --> 01:56:00.473]  But when the media says it's time to go protest, let's go protest about Brown, who's about the worst poster child to be against police brutality you could ever have.
[01:56:01.273 --> 01:56:03.535]  A big thug, the evidence shows.
[01:56:06.197 --> 01:56:07.238]  Locked out of his mind.
[01:56:07.698 --> 01:56:10.240]  The grand jury witnesses said he was acting like a demon.
[01:56:10.281 --> 01:56:11.141]  He was crazed.
[01:56:13.083 --> 01:56:14.464]  God knows what was going on.
[01:56:17.492 --> 01:56:18.212]  This is who?
[01:56:18.333 --> 01:56:19.773]  I mean, this is so stupid!
[01:56:21.034 --> 01:56:25.057]  All fighting with each other, going to Obama, begging him to do something.
[01:56:25.237 --> 01:56:25.577]  He is.
[01:56:25.617 --> 01:56:26.538]  He took your jobs.
[01:56:28.579 --> 01:56:31.180]  Black unemployment went from 7% to 15%.
[01:56:31.641 --> 01:56:32.201]  Do the math.
[01:56:32.561 --> 01:56:35.503]  That's more than doubled since he got in office.
[01:56:36.864 --> 01:56:38.685]  Other unemployment didn't go that bad.
[01:56:42.884 --> 01:56:47.928]  You go and you beg to Obama, and they may have the Justice Department come down and indict the cop.
[01:56:49.049 --> 01:56:53.892]  Which again, federalization, federalization, federalization.
[01:56:54.933 --> 01:57:03.299]  I'm going to go to Ken in South Carolina and Rick and Dan and James and Chris and everybody else as soon as we start the next hour.
[01:57:03.319 --> 01:57:07.863]  We did pretty good taking a lot of calls, but I'm really going to move quick when we start the next hour.
[01:57:09.642 --> 01:57:23.411]  And then we'll go through some of the latest developments on this front, but if people are already demonstrating by the thousands in front of the White House... By the way, you don't get a permit, usually, to demonstrate in front of the White House.
[01:57:23.431 --> 01:57:24.131]  They arrest you.
[01:57:24.831 --> 01:57:26.212]  Even liberal groups, they arrest you.
[01:57:26.773 --> 01:57:28.013]  Pro-gun groups, you can forget it.
[01:57:30.575 --> 01:57:33.517]  I've been there, 200 yards away, and they tell me don't videotape.
[01:57:34.412 --> 01:57:37.134]  On video, the Secret Service on bikes and uniforms.
[01:57:37.694 --> 01:57:44.059]  But now, oh, thousands want to show up at night with their signs all ready, printed out by these Democratic Party groups.
[01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:47.581]  PSLweb.org.
[01:57:52.325 --> 01:57:54.646]  And you can see the handwriting on the so-called handmade ones.
[01:57:55.047 --> 01:57:56.648]  I've been to UN events and things and covered them.
[01:57:56.668 --> 01:57:59.590]  They'll have a whole stack of fake signs made up that look different.
[01:58:00.711 --> 01:58:02.132]  I'm going to throw up at this point.
[01:58:03.561 --> 01:58:05.022]  I'm looking at a Washington Times article.
[01:58:07.784 --> 01:58:10.085]  What this signifies, yeah, liberation.
[01:58:10.125 --> 01:58:11.586]  It's basically like a communist group.
[01:58:12.546 --> 01:58:13.287]  Oh my gosh.
[01:58:13.627 --> 01:58:14.728]  About the PSL.
[01:58:15.848 --> 01:58:18.850]  The Socialist Liberation Newspaper.
[01:58:19.591 --> 01:58:20.351]  Oh my God.
[01:58:20.531 --> 01:58:20.912]  Help me.
[01:58:22.112 --> 01:58:22.733]  Oh my God.
[01:58:23.573 --> 01:58:24.894]  Who wants violent revolution?
[01:58:25.314 --> 01:58:25.895]  The communists.
[01:58:26.335 --> 01:58:27.235]  Who wants an overthrow?
[01:58:27.275 --> 01:58:28.336]  Who wants to get stuff going?
[01:58:28.976 --> 01:58:31.218]  But above that, the globalists fund communists.
[01:58:31.238 --> 01:58:33.039]  Why would the biggest banks fund communists and stuff?
[01:58:34.366 --> 01:58:37.028]  Because they want the destabilization to then be able to come in and crush it.
[01:58:38.069 --> 01:58:42.753]  This is... I'm telling you, if they'll do this here, it means they're planning to move nationwide to stir stuff up.
[01:58:43.233 --> 01:58:47.196]  The White House is definitely fanning the flames, definitely behind this.
[01:58:47.536 --> 01:58:48.697]  Third hour coming up.
[01:58:49.278 --> 01:58:50.539]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:50.619 --> 01:58:51.920]  Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock.
[01:58:52.160 --> 01:58:52.980]  Third hour coming up.
[01:58:59.645 --> 01:59:03.148]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:59:03.308 --> 01:59:07.271]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:59:07.591 --> 01:59:09.053]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:59:09.373 --> 01:59:16.959]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:59:17.239 --> 01:59:18.080]  But for how long?
[01:59:18.380 --> 01:59:24.645]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:59:25.025 --> 01:59:27.828]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:59:29.423 --> 01:59:33.266]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[01:59:34.027 --> 01:59:40.272]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.
[01:59:40.392 --> 01:59:49.439]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior vitality in males and females.

[02:00:01.460 --> 02:00:04.076]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:15.526 --> 02:00:16.146]  Big Brother.
[02:00:16.826 --> 02:00:17.867]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:18.607 --> 02:00:19.687]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:20.367 --> 02:00:21.168]  You want answers?
[02:00:21.948 --> 02:00:22.868]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.488 --> 02:00:27.129]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:27.689 --> 02:00:31.770]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.110 --> 02:00:34.931]  Protester has phone stolen while live streaming.
[02:00:35.291 --> 02:00:37.632]  MSNBC anchor chased off by gunfire.
[02:00:38.552 --> 02:00:40.393]  Fox reporter in Ferguson attacked.
[02:00:40.433 --> 02:00:41.193]  Camera stolen.
[02:00:43.939 --> 02:00:48.281]  I mean, you got demonstrators being robbed by thugs.
[02:00:48.401 --> 02:00:51.162]  It's just a free-for-all of criminal scumdom.
[02:00:52.822 --> 02:00:54.123]  Meant to demonize the First Amendment.
[02:00:54.783 --> 02:00:55.924]  That's why they're being protected.
[02:00:56.744 --> 02:00:58.164]  Will they let it go two or three nights?
[02:00:58.725 --> 02:01:01.286]  Let the rioting go through Thanksgiving before the feds do something?
[02:01:02.666 --> 02:01:04.467]  There'll be no investigation of who was in charge.
[02:01:04.887 --> 02:01:07.048]  There'll be no investigation of why it's allowed to get out of hand.
[02:01:08.868 --> 02:01:10.589]  Our reporters will be investigating, though.
[02:01:11.549 --> 02:01:12.150]  And that's why
[02:01:13.174 --> 02:01:15.037]  They better watch it once the police move.
[02:01:15.998 --> 02:01:20.243]  Because the police are being nice to the reporters now, only because that's their orders.
[02:01:21.084 --> 02:01:22.166]  In this phase of the PSYOP.
[02:01:23.147 --> 02:01:26.431]  As soon as they're ready to move, they'll start attacking reporters again, I predict.
[02:01:27.293 --> 02:01:29.235]  Ken in South Carolina, thanks for holding.
[02:01:29.556 --> 02:01:30.437]  You're on the air, welcome.
[02:01:32.116 --> 02:01:41.588]  Hey Alex, I'm really glad that you've had the foresight to use the money that we give you as supporters to send Jakari and Joe out there on the front lines because we don't have to listen to the lies CNN and the Fox.
[02:01:41.668 --> 02:01:44.592]  We can analyze the raw footage ourselves as it happens.
[02:01:45.939 --> 02:01:46.580]  Well, thank you, sir.
[02:01:46.620 --> 02:01:47.360]  That's our goal.
[02:01:47.420 --> 02:01:48.681]  That's why we have the sponsors.
[02:01:48.701 --> 02:01:49.862]  That's why we have the products.
[02:01:50.142 --> 02:02:01.590]  It's so we can build good studios, so we can dress nice, so we can send out good investigative journalists, so we can try to bring you live six-hour feeds, so you can make a decision.
[02:02:01.670 --> 02:02:02.031]  Thank you.
[02:02:02.051 --> 02:02:02.331]  Go ahead.
[02:02:03.396 --> 02:02:04.016]  And that's the thing.
[02:02:04.056 --> 02:02:06.317]  For the folks that weren't watching this, I watched the whole thing live.
[02:02:06.357 --> 02:02:08.899]  I really appreciate Joe and Jakari getting that footage the way they did.
[02:02:09.199 --> 02:02:11.580]  I want to point out first, let's get this out of the way, Alex.
[02:02:12.020 --> 02:02:28.888]  As you know, if George Zimmerman had to defend himself in court with his own personal resources in a case where the law enforcement did not want to charge him, this officer, right or wrong, could have been charged by the state, guilty or not, and gone through the process and kept everything transparent and this could have been de-escalated.
[02:02:29.824 --> 02:02:33.666]  Number two, as a fire chief, arson is a difficult thing.
[02:02:33.686 --> 02:02:35.868]  You can't just torch a building in five minutes.
[02:02:36.428 --> 02:02:45.894]  And when Jakari and Joe were down the block, when they left the main scene, they went down the block when the building was on fire, those firefighters cutting the doors were trying to breach ahead of the fire.
[02:02:46.274 --> 02:02:51.998]  So even they were surprised at the rate at which that fire was going through that building, and they thought they could get ahead of it, but they didn't.
[02:02:52.498 --> 02:03:00.829]  That was a major, for folks that didn't see, we're talking about a huge warehouse building, and unless they insulated with paper, I don't see how that building went quite as fast as it did.
[02:03:01.209 --> 02:03:07.257]  The fire department pre-planned, so they would have known if there was something hazmat, and if it was a matchstick house, they would have stayed outside.
[02:03:07.297 --> 02:03:08.759]  They wouldn't have been breaching, making entry.
[02:03:09.685 --> 02:03:12.226]  The officers have to be defended.
[02:03:12.246 --> 02:03:17.527]  The line officers pulled those men out because the police department refused to give them support and defense.
[02:03:17.947 --> 02:03:20.208]  And those firefighters have laid down their lives for their community.
[02:03:20.248 --> 02:03:28.210]  So the firefighters are not to be blamed, and those officers aren't, because they're responsible for every firefighter under their command, and they know those guys would not have backed off.
[02:03:29.050 --> 02:03:29.390]  That's right.
[02:03:29.430 --> 02:03:32.111]  I should have gone to you earlier, and I want to hold you over.
[02:03:32.891 --> 02:03:33.212]  Do this.
[02:03:33.232 --> 02:03:35.732]  I want to come back at the start of the next segment and have you start over.
[02:03:35.772 --> 02:03:37.653]  As I saw on screen, Ken,
[02:03:39.281 --> 02:03:41.122]  You know, quote firefighter.
[02:03:41.702 --> 02:03:44.464]  Are you currently a firefighter or are you saying you're a fire chief?
[02:03:45.424 --> 02:03:50.867]  I was a fire chief, I was a firefighter, and I was a South Carolina Fire Academy certified instructor for interior firefighting.
[02:03:51.607 --> 02:04:01.412]  I have over 500 if not 700 calls under my belt over 13 years combined service in the fire service and I did carabadging down in South Carolina for a short period as an LEO.
[02:04:02.634 --> 02:04:17.819]  Sure, well I want to come back from break then and pick your brain if you watched hours of the live footage to tell us as an expert your perspective on what you saw because I'm here just trying to brainstorm with the public, brainstorm with my reporters, try to figure out exactly what's happening.
[02:04:18.780 --> 02:04:19.600]  I see Obama
[02:04:20.888 --> 02:04:23.170]  Clearly in control of the guard, having him stand down.
[02:04:23.190 --> 02:04:26.293]  Having the announcement at 8 o'clock at night, the perfect time.
[02:04:26.733 --> 02:04:27.994]  Having the police stand down.
[02:04:28.014 --> 02:04:31.757]  This looks like a premeditated operation.
[02:04:31.837 --> 02:04:32.278]  Stay there.
[02:04:32.678 --> 02:04:33.098]  Don't hang up.
[02:04:33.118 --> 02:04:34.460]  I'm going to come right back to you, Ken.
[02:04:35.888 --> 02:04:50.443]  So you can give us your take on what you saw, and if you think we're getting it right here on air, straight ahead, or where we're getting it wrong, come right back to you, Ken, in South Carolina, former fire chief, to get your take on that and police officer.
[02:04:50.923 --> 02:04:52.044]  And then we'll go to Rick.
[02:04:52.765 --> 02:04:57.510]  And then we'll go to Dan, and James, and Chris, and others, and then it's your chance to call in.
[02:04:57.850 --> 02:05:01.493]  Toll-free number is 800-259-9231.
[02:05:01.834 --> 02:05:05.677]  Because if it is a PSYOP, which it clearly is, what's the big endgame?
[02:05:06.078 --> 02:05:07.239]  That's the next shoe to drop.
[02:05:09.872 --> 02:05:15.255]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:05:16.515 --> 02:05:21.277]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:05:21.658 --> 02:05:28.441]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:30.382 --> 02:05:32.583]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:05:32.863 --> 02:05:36.725]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:05:48.543 --> 02:05:50.424]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:05:50.684 --> 02:05:52.205]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:05:52.465 --> 02:05:55.026]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:05:55.346 --> 02:05:59.407]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[02:05:59.427 --> 02:06:01.608]  So you can ride all day with confidence.

[02:06:04.689 --> 02:06:06.109]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:06:06.269 --> 02:06:06.709]  Got it.
[02:06:07.050 --> 02:06:07.850]  Others don't.
[02:06:09.434 --> 02:06:10.435]  The experts are clear.
[02:06:10.755 --> 02:06:17.739]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[02:06:17.879 --> 02:06:24.122]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[02:06:24.142 --> 02:06:27.744]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[02:06:27.864 --> 02:06:31.765]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[02:06:32.085 --> 02:06:37.126]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:06:37.407 --> 02:06:38.307]  Not our iodine.
[02:06:38.407 --> 02:06:44.568]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[02:07:53.262 --> 02:07:53.842]  We have the power!
[02:07:53.862 --> 02:07:54.763]  Do you want to fight?
[02:07:54.783 --> 02:07:56.083]  You better believe you got one!
[02:08:21.824 --> 02:08:26.267]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:08:26.867 --> 02:08:28.328]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:30.509 --> 02:08:32.591]  We've got open phones throughout this hour.
[02:08:35.458 --> 02:08:44.748]  And I've asked police officers, firefighters, you name it, to call in and give us your take on the live stream feeds that we and others have had, the coverage you've seen on mainstream media.
[02:08:45.509 --> 02:08:51.515]  We had upwards of 200,000 people at any one time logged in to our two different streams last night.
[02:08:52.316 --> 02:08:54.737]  And that's a lot for alternative media.
[02:08:54.817 --> 02:08:56.758]  I mean, I'm on commercial AM and FM stations.
[02:08:57.158 --> 02:09:01.179]  You could even kind of call that mainstream media or old-school alternative media.
[02:09:02.080 --> 02:09:11.383]  But to be trailblazing with hundreds of thousands of live streaming viewers really challenges the old media because
[02:09:13.607 --> 02:09:16.970]  They can't just show you little clips and then try to spin it.
[02:09:17.410 --> 02:09:21.034]  You can see for yourself what really went on and what happened.
[02:09:21.394 --> 02:09:31.062]  Certainly we took the hours of footage we have and condensed some of it down to, I don't want to call it highlights because it's pretty scary stuff, but the absolute chaos.
[02:09:31.082 --> 02:09:35.326]  You know, Joe Biggs had embedded reporters with him in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:09:35.767 --> 02:09:37.768]  They got written about in Esquire and in
[02:09:38.863 --> 02:09:39.844]  Rolling Stone, you name it.
[02:09:40.104 --> 02:09:42.486]  Because Biggs happened to see a lot of heavy combat.
[02:09:42.506 --> 02:09:44.828]  He got blown up twice in armored vehicles.
[02:09:45.909 --> 02:09:47.591]  He got shot up several times.
[02:09:47.931 --> 02:09:54.857]  He was in some of the biggest Taliban battles that there were in Afghanistan that went on for days in some cases.
[02:09:56.198 --> 02:10:00.321]  And he said this was more bizarre because it was just so stupid.
[02:10:00.962 --> 02:10:04.245]  The shooting in all directions and people burning things down.
[02:10:05.766 --> 02:10:09.449]  Protestors, robbing protestors, because they're not really protestors.
[02:10:09.890 --> 02:10:11.451]  Some of them, obviously, are criminals.
[02:10:11.851 --> 02:10:20.239]  Piggybacking on this, but what type of criminal shoots at firefighters trying to put people's houses out in a black neighborhood?
[02:10:20.259 --> 02:10:22.100]  I mean, they burn down mainly black businesses.
[02:10:22.621 --> 02:10:25.884]  There's an article out reporting on this.
[02:10:25.984 --> 02:10:28.366]  Most businesses destroyed were minority-owned.
[02:10:29.417 --> 02:10:37.541]  Breitbart reports, and it goes over a listing of them, and then they burn down like Mexican food restaurants and cleaners owned by black people.
[02:10:37.701 --> 02:10:40.643]  I mean, let's just burn this cleaners down here.
[02:10:41.984 --> 02:10:49.508]  That'd be like, God forbid, let's say a bad cop shot one of my kids for no reason.
[02:10:50.048 --> 02:10:51.269]  I would civilly sue them.
[02:10:51.849 --> 02:10:52.810]  I would go after them.
[02:10:52.970 --> 02:10:53.930]  I would speak about it.
[02:10:54.931 --> 02:10:58.973]  And if justice wasn't done, well, I'd have to think about it at that point.
[02:11:00.043 --> 02:11:01.404]  But it would be that cop.
[02:11:02.385 --> 02:11:08.529]  Not all the cops or not a Mexican food restaurant or here let me take my baby to a protest.
[02:11:09.170 --> 02:11:16.134]  Again, folks are taught that this is how they protest because it makes you pathetic in the world's eyes.
[02:11:17.095 --> 02:11:18.856]  Instead of being politically involved.
[02:11:19.557 --> 02:11:24.160]  The establishment doesn't mess with people that are politically involved and are middle class.
[02:11:24.220 --> 02:11:26.442]  I don't care what color you are because they know your trouble.
[02:11:26.742 --> 02:11:27.803]  You know how to get stuff done.
[02:11:28.902 --> 02:11:33.787]  They don't mess with somebody in a sports jacket with a suit and tie that pulls up in a Mercedes-Benz.
[02:11:34.087 --> 02:11:37.811]  And I'm not saying you're not successful if you don't pull up in a Mercedes-Benz.
[02:11:38.231 --> 02:11:40.794]  The point is that the system pays attention to that.
[02:11:41.334 --> 02:11:44.558]  And they know you're not a wounded gazelle.
[02:11:45.999 --> 02:11:57.304]  Even if you're looking at the system as purely predatory, the system has predatory sectors in it, veins in it, and there's an attempt to make the system predatory across the board.
[02:11:57.564 --> 02:11:58.385]  That's globalism.
[02:11:58.425 --> 02:11:59.045]  That's tyranny.
[02:11:59.725 --> 02:12:01.206]  But that's from the top down.
[02:12:01.626 --> 02:12:12.031]  We need to politically target the progenitors, the kingpins, the mafiadons, the globalists that are setting the social engineering system.
[02:12:13.198 --> 02:12:20.744]  Not firefighters, not police officers, not a black church got set on fire?
[02:12:21.245 --> 02:12:22.686]  Biggs is going to go over and get some footage of that.
[02:12:22.726 --> 02:12:26.129]  I mean, what is going on here?
[02:12:26.909 --> 02:12:31.373]  What culture has been created where we see this thug life garbage?
[02:12:31.633 --> 02:12:32.074]  And by the way,
[02:12:33.035 --> 02:12:42.399]  They've got it in white culture, where it's more of like a end of the world, I don't care about anybody, hurt myself, hurt others, almost satanic stuff going on.
[02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:48.322]  This is happening in the youth, it's being pushed in the culture, and it's part of the societal sickness.
[02:12:48.342 --> 02:12:50.023]  Now I'm gonna shut up and go to Ken and others.
[02:12:50.363 --> 02:12:53.405]  Ken called in earlier, but we went to break, so I wanted to recap.
[02:12:53.865 --> 02:13:00.348]  He's been a police officer, he's also 13 years a firefighter and a police chief, a fire chief.
[02:13:00.868 --> 02:13:12.931]  And he's moved on to other lines of work now, but he was breaking down what he saw in our live streams and some of the HD footage of where the firefighters are getting shot at and get ordered to be pulled out.
[02:13:13.631 --> 02:13:19.632]  And bullets are literally bouncing off of the armored vehicles and hitting the firetrucks.
[02:13:20.012 --> 02:13:24.213]  Just like we saw in 1992 in LA, people shooting at the firetrucks.
[02:13:24.693 --> 02:13:27.014]  And we had two officers that were shot last night, you name it.
[02:13:27.884 --> 02:13:35.589]  When this will only create massive enmity now in the community, massive distrust, massive problems.
[02:13:36.029 --> 02:13:40.012]  And the larger question is, why did Obama order a stand down of the National Guard?
[02:13:40.472 --> 02:13:42.714]  When the governor had said they would be energetic and aggressive.
[02:13:43.254 --> 02:13:44.555]  Why did the police stand down?
[02:13:44.915 --> 02:13:47.397]  That will elicit a much bigger response tonight.
[02:13:48.237 --> 02:13:52.799]  And we'll be the green light for this to show up in other parts of the country in my humble view.
[02:13:53.620 --> 02:13:59.883]  Now we'll get Ken's take as an expert, a firefighter, a former fire chief, and he's also a police officer.
[02:14:00.423 --> 02:14:06.146]  Ken, tell me what you think of our coverage so far, then give us your perspectives on what you saw.
[02:14:06.566 --> 02:14:07.987]  And it sounded like you were hinting
[02:14:08.976 --> 02:14:21.473]  That footage you saw that we put out, where they're trying to get ahead of the fire and block it, but that it was moving so quickly, were you hinting at the fact that these arsonists look like they have sophisticated training, or what were you getting at?
[02:14:22.992 --> 02:14:25.913]  Yes, I'm hitting, let's for credibility's sake let me clarify now.
[02:14:25.993 --> 02:14:28.014]  I was law enforcement, I was a security officer.
[02:14:28.034 --> 02:14:30.835]  We get police training and we're sworn law enforcement for the state.
[02:14:30.855 --> 02:14:33.737]  I was not a regular police officer, though I was a beat cop on the accounts.
[02:14:33.757 --> 02:14:34.737]  I had to do police work.
[02:14:35.117 --> 02:14:35.797]  Sure, sure, I understand.
[02:14:35.817 --> 02:14:41.520]  You had just said you carried a badge and gun and you were talking about being a firefighter, but just getting that out of the way, go ahead.
[02:14:42.577 --> 02:14:43.438]  The footage has been great.
[02:14:43.518 --> 02:14:54.770]  Initially, I want to point out that those officers, when the first shots were fired, which probably were an agent provocateur, when Joe and Ja'Kari were right there at the police station, those officers started backing down.
[02:14:54.810 --> 02:15:02.778]  And I posted, you know, watch out because they're backing down to play the victim here so that they can justify a brutal response.
[02:15:03.198 --> 02:15:05.420]  And then a few minutes later we see them moving down the street.
[02:15:05.861 --> 02:15:13.549]  For the record, when they closed off those streets with cars that Joe and Jakari reported, that made the streets were all then public walkways.
[02:15:14.109 --> 02:15:15.871]  Once they blocked those streets to...
[02:15:17.179 --> 02:15:17.739]  Car traffic.
[02:15:18.159 --> 02:15:18.860]  It was walkways.
[02:15:19.300 --> 02:15:26.923]  They then marched on the people and tear gassed the crowd, which led to, you know, forcing the crowd into a violent response.
[02:15:27.403 --> 02:15:29.304]  And then all of a sudden we find about the fires.
[02:15:29.744 --> 02:15:33.226]  And that's the problem of building that large down the street that far away.
[02:15:33.246 --> 02:15:36.007]  It takes time to burn a building like that.
[02:15:36.287 --> 02:15:39.269]  Like the nail place has highly flammable chemicals in it.
[02:15:39.389 --> 02:15:44.931]  It could burn, but even that place, it takes a few minutes to get the fire going to a point that it roars like that.
[02:15:45.515 --> 02:15:49.276]  With a major building, you have to question the timing.
[02:15:49.477 --> 02:15:53.158]  I've responded to fires after a half hour and we get there in time to save a small building.
[02:15:53.418 --> 02:15:56.439]  I mean, I'm talking about a house, not even a major warehouse.
[02:15:56.799 --> 02:16:03.842]  So unless that insulation was in there, those guys pre-planned their building so if there was something dangerous in there and they thought it was going to burn quickly and collapse,
[02:16:04.545 --> 02:16:12.353]  Like the major fire that happened in Georgetown, South Carolina recently, where our firefighters didn't go in because they knew ahead of time, don't go in if it catches fire, surround and drown.
[02:16:12.753 --> 02:16:18.138]  With this, they did a surround and drown on the front, but they began cutting in, breaching as though they could get ahead of the fire.
[02:16:18.459 --> 02:16:22.923]  So they were not anticipating that that fire could sweep that entire building the way it did.
[02:16:23.550 --> 02:16:29.379]  So, and the other thing is, Alex, we always teach, watch the crowd in a potential arson situation.
[02:16:29.399 --> 02:16:36.710]  Now, we know this is arson, whether or not it's an agent provocateur, whether it's not, you know, whether it's outside, whether it's Delta Force, black helicopters, I don't care.
[02:16:37.211 --> 02:16:39.394]  Whoever burned it, did it, it was arson.
[02:16:40.279 --> 02:16:49.165]  That meant that they would be watching, and the second thing is, if it was some sort of agent provocateur, they would then be the ones firing on the fire department.
[02:16:49.565 --> 02:17:00.312]  Immediately, the police should have gone ahead and circled, and given them shielding, and then looked for where those shots are being fired, because that's your prime suspect in the arson case, because they don't want the fire to go out.
[02:17:00.632 --> 02:17:07.036]  The firefighters were concerned that if they didn't contain it in that building, it could spread to the surrounding community, literally burning down the city.
[02:17:07.728 --> 02:17:09.050]  And so they weren't going to give up.
[02:17:09.570 --> 02:17:17.298]  But that's what begs the question, is how buildings like these burn that fast, because it takes planning, you know, to make sure a building goes up in flames.
[02:17:17.359 --> 02:17:23.605]  I've seen a building burn that I suspected that it was allowed to burn, and it took two hours to burn it down.
[02:17:23.785 --> 02:17:29.612]  And we're talking about a lumber, we're talking about lumber burning, you know, and paint company, and it took hours to burn.
[02:17:29.972 --> 02:17:36.839]  Sure, unless it's really dry and there's 80 mile an hour winds, I guess those are some of the only fires that can really go quick, unless it's an old tinderbox house.
[02:17:37.140 --> 02:17:40.483]  I'm not a firefighter like you, but I absolutely hear what you're saying.
[02:17:41.024 --> 02:17:43.146]  Big picture, what do you think's really going on here?
[02:17:43.466 --> 02:17:45.168]  What do you think this is distracting from?
[02:17:45.469 --> 02:17:48.452]  Who do you think's behind this, if it is an overall PSYOP?
[02:17:49.602 --> 02:17:57.330]  Well, Obama couldn't get his outbreak so far and he couldn't get his other problems, so it looks like this is a tinderbox.
[02:17:57.811 --> 02:18:06.060]  This is throwing a spark into a tinderbox because this is escalating because the people in Ferguson have a right to be upset.
[02:18:06.580 --> 02:18:07.780]  There has been malfeasance.
[02:18:07.820 --> 02:18:13.402]  We're seeing, I mean, no one wants to discuss about the black guy that was suicidal that got shot by cops when he was over 10 feet away.
[02:18:13.662 --> 02:18:15.423]  There was no way for him to jump on those two officers.
[02:18:15.763 --> 02:18:17.644]  It happened right after this guy's shooting.
[02:18:18.104 --> 02:18:20.585]  No one is protesting Crawford to this level.
[02:18:20.965 --> 02:18:27.267]  So they're provoking this because there was sufficient manpower to have gotten the instigators and the provocateurs.
[02:18:27.687 --> 02:18:31.208]  When the people were in the street and they were protesting peaceably,
[02:18:32.083 --> 02:18:34.145]  Even though there might have been gunfire, there was nobody in the crowd.
[02:18:34.705 --> 02:18:38.307]  Alex, when you dump a mag into a crowd, you expect multiple casualties.
[02:18:38.808 --> 02:18:40.929]  There weren't multiple casualties at the first firing.
[02:18:41.550 --> 02:18:47.894]  The black gentleman standing next to Joe last night was cussing at the cops and taunting them, but he would not fire first.
[02:18:47.934 --> 02:18:50.776]  He said, hey, if you shoot at us and you kill anybody else, we'll shoot back.
[02:18:51.076 --> 02:18:52.277]  And that's what people need to look at.
[02:18:52.317 --> 02:18:54.699]  The locals were saying, hey, this has got to stop.
[02:18:54.739 --> 02:18:56.140]  This shoot first mentality has got to stop.
[02:18:56.400 --> 02:18:57.661]  But if you shoot us, we'll shoot back.
[02:18:58.021 --> 02:19:01.085]  They were not being provocative or firing at the police officers.
[02:19:01.385 --> 02:19:03.007]  So it calls into question who was doing the shooting.
[02:19:03.288 --> 02:19:05.190]  And the people in the street were not shooting.
[02:19:05.530 --> 02:19:09.455]  They were kneeling, some of them, in a peaceful protest like Tiananmen Square.
[02:19:09.816 --> 02:19:11.678]  And the response was to tear gas the crowd.
[02:19:11.998 --> 02:19:13.881]  It's a myth that you can do riot control, Alex.
[02:19:14.361 --> 02:19:15.382]  You can't control a crowd.
[02:19:15.422 --> 02:19:16.582]  They can tear you apart.
[02:19:16.683 --> 02:19:23.427]  I've got a friend that was a veteran in Korea, and when the human wave attacks started in Korea, they slaughtered them wholesale.
[02:19:23.467 --> 02:19:24.988]  They couldn't stop the human wave attacks.
[02:19:25.348 --> 02:19:28.430]  If that crowd had wanted those police officers, they could have had them.
[02:19:28.770 --> 02:19:29.670]  They were being peaceable.
[02:19:30.071 --> 02:19:37.275]  But to attack the crowd with violence is to provoke the people, because the next step, when they can't get justice, they feel they have been wrong.
[02:19:37.927 --> 02:19:38.207]  Absolutely.
[02:19:38.668 --> 02:19:43.032]  Look, if they'd have pounced on people, the criminals, immediately, they'd have been heroes.
[02:19:43.072 --> 02:19:45.214]  All this would have got shut down.
[02:19:45.234 --> 02:19:45.434]  That's 101.
[02:19:45.554 --> 02:19:45.854]  Great call.
[02:19:45.874 --> 02:19:46.535]  Great perspective.
[02:19:46.675 --> 02:19:47.155]  Thank you, Ken.
[02:20:04.969 --> 02:20:08.510]  We'll come back with Dan and others that are patiently holding.
[02:20:08.851 --> 02:20:09.911]  Stay with us, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:20:10.231 --> 02:20:10.992]  Hey Boomer!
[02:20:11.232 --> 02:20:14.573]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[02:20:14.673 --> 02:20:16.254]  Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[02:20:16.354 --> 02:20:18.094]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[02:20:18.295 --> 02:20:23.797]  Mom says it's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[02:20:24.137 --> 02:20:24.897]  I know, right?
[02:20:24.977 --> 02:20:25.758]  You love it too!
[02:20:26.778 --> 02:20:27.578]  I'm thirsty, too.
[02:20:27.718 --> 02:20:28.619]  Let's go get some!

[02:20:39.261 --> 02:20:41.842]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.

[02:21:09.762 --> 02:21:14.828]  The lining of your lungs is supposed to be protected with glutathione to neutralize incoming irritants.

[02:21:24.500 --> 02:21:25.580]  Hi, my name is Bill O'Brien.
[02:21:26.021 --> 02:21:28.782]  I generally suffer through an asthmatic breathing type situation.
[02:21:29.502 --> 02:21:32.363]  My breathing is shallow and generally constricted in the nose and lungs.
[02:21:33.043 --> 02:21:38.245]  After consuming One World Weight today, I have tremendous energy and also notice my breathing is free.
[02:21:39.025 --> 02:21:46.008]  I can feel the air in my left nostril and it is free all the way to my abdomen, which is pretty remarkable because I rarely get that feeling.
[02:21:46.028 --> 02:21:48.409]  Being a singer, I love feeling this unrestricted voice.
[02:21:49.125 --> 02:21:52.306]  The only thing new I've actually added to my routine is One World Way.
[02:21:52.927 --> 02:21:53.127]  Wow!

[02:24:23.426 --> 02:24:23.767]  Central.
[02:24:24.227 --> 02:24:28.772]  I'll be here live this coming next Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:24:28.812 --> 02:24:29.173]  Central.
[02:24:29.193 --> 02:24:32.657]  I think I'm gonna take off Thursday and Friday to be with family.
[02:24:34.594 --> 02:24:49.333]  But if all Hades is breaking loose and these riots spread around the country, I or David Knight or some of the other crew will be in here with special reports live on the radio and live on the nightly news.
[02:24:49.413 --> 02:24:49.754]  In fact,
[02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:52.942]  We'll have continual coverage and commentary.
[02:24:53.223 --> 02:24:58.709]  Jakari and Biggs are going to be there as well, covering what's unfolding.
[02:24:59.229 --> 02:25:02.693]  And we'll have live streams at the top of Infowars.com tonight.
[02:25:04.415 --> 02:25:08.719]  I guess the headline will be, Live Feed of Ferguson War Zone.
[02:25:09.740 --> 02:25:11.062]  Because that's what it is.
[02:25:12.551 --> 02:25:15.713]  Alright, let's go through a bunch of your calls, and I've got other breaking news.
[02:25:15.733 --> 02:25:19.695]  Obamacare architect Gruber set to testify at December House hearing.
[02:25:19.755 --> 02:25:20.115]  Good.
[02:25:20.475 --> 02:25:21.196]  Drag him in.
[02:25:22.176 --> 02:25:23.877]  That's just some of the news we've got coming up.
[02:25:24.237 --> 02:25:26.438]  Right now, let's go to Dan in Texas.
[02:25:26.458 --> 02:25:27.039]  Thanks for holding.
[02:25:28.179 --> 02:25:29.220]  Hi Alex, good afternoon.
[02:25:31.104 --> 02:25:31.824]  Thank you.
[02:25:31.844 --> 02:25:58.302]  Alright, Alex, as I was listening to the show today and watching the live feed last night, it just occurred to me, what if we could, like the Infowarriors, could show that there's still some hope for the light in the world, and help maybe, a little fund to help rebuild, not rebuild the city, I mean that's overcoming too much, but some of these mom and pop, they gotta be a deductible, you know, something like that, like how do you help the phone lady, the Obama phone lady, or that artist you met at the Alamo, and
[02:25:59.466 --> 02:26:00.626]  You know, I try to do that.
[02:26:00.666 --> 02:26:01.967]  I try to show good cops.
[02:26:02.027 --> 02:26:04.587]  I try to show, you know, success stories.
[02:26:04.747 --> 02:26:07.108]  I try to be as positive as I can because that's the answer.
[02:26:07.568 --> 02:26:08.668]  I don't want to just be negative.
[02:26:09.388 --> 02:26:18.770]  But at the same time, there's footage of what looks like, you know, part black CNN reporter being hit in the head by a rock.
[02:26:18.850 --> 02:26:24.832]  And there's another lady who looks, you know, a lady of color from another channel being attacked by the crowd.
[02:26:25.871 --> 02:26:31.094]  And I just think it's a bunch of scum thugs that just want an excuse to commit crime.
[02:26:32.215 --> 02:26:36.457]  And that's what you always see is a lot of criminals will piggyback on some cause.
[02:26:37.538 --> 02:26:43.162]  And the system knows this and is allowing this to go on so they can demonize all of our basic freedoms.
[02:26:43.182 --> 02:26:43.642]  But I hear you.
[02:26:44.987 --> 02:26:46.650]  You can just see the desperate.
[02:26:46.670 --> 02:26:47.792]  This is a low blow.
[02:26:48.173 --> 02:26:52.080]  This isn't something up there at the 9-11 type thing.
[02:26:52.160 --> 02:26:55.847]  This is so low that this is like a last-ditch effort.
[02:26:56.775 --> 02:26:57.135]  Yeah, no.
[02:26:57.536 --> 02:26:58.216]  Oh, I agree.
[02:26:59.057 --> 02:27:07.744]  And why would Delta Force, I'm not saying they've done this, but they've done it before in Seattle, and they killed the folks at Waco, they're the ones, came out in congressional testimony.
[02:27:07.764 --> 02:27:09.925]  People don't say, there's a mystery of Waco.
[02:27:10.085 --> 02:27:10.786]  There's no mystery.
[02:27:11.146 --> 02:27:12.167]  Delta Force was there.
[02:27:12.808 --> 02:27:16.610]  They were the ones behind the Bradley fighting vehicles, doing the infantry maneuvers.
[02:27:17.031 --> 02:27:20.033]  They were the ones that shot the peoples they were trying to get out the back.
[02:27:20.473 --> 02:27:21.754]  They were the ones that went in and put
[02:27:22.575 --> 02:27:30.738]  The bomb on the church records vault, the concrete structure inside where the women and children were hiding, and it turned them into splattered soup all over the walls.
[02:27:31.258 --> 02:27:41.861]  General Benton K. Parton was the former head of Air Force Weapons Development, has like three degrees, frequent guest of this show, ran the HAARP program, everything.
[02:27:43.047 --> 02:27:44.488]  He went and investigated it.
[02:27:44.948 --> 02:27:46.930]  He got the photos and all the rest of it.
[02:27:47.410 --> 02:27:48.471]  The people were unburned.
[02:27:48.491 --> 02:27:49.211]  They were soup.
[02:27:49.992 --> 02:27:54.335]  The Delta Force, with an infantry maneuver, climbed in the building, killed a bunch of people.
[02:27:54.675 --> 02:27:56.316]  They had an order, kill everyone.
[02:27:57.277 --> 02:27:59.098]  And they went in there and they killed the men.
[02:27:59.759 --> 02:28:06.603]  They went in and planted a bomb on top of the building and then blew a hole right through it with shrapnel, with a shape charge, killing everybody.
[02:28:08.205 --> 02:28:11.227]  And the fact that they're there now
[02:28:13.015 --> 02:28:14.496]  Prime suspects and everything.
[02:28:14.516 --> 02:28:20.102]  I'll tell you right now, or whoever those special forces are from Fort Bragg, may not be Delta Force.
[02:28:21.122 --> 02:28:23.825]  I'm just sorry they've done it over and over and over again.
[02:28:24.325 --> 02:28:27.268]  As soon as they showed up, it screamed red flags.
[02:28:27.969 --> 02:28:29.610]  Screamed staged events.
[02:28:29.991 --> 02:28:30.831]  And who do they work for?
[02:28:30.932 --> 02:28:31.772]  Not even the Pentagon.
[02:28:32.033 --> 02:28:34.515]  They work for the President directly.
[02:28:35.922 --> 02:28:38.285]  And so that tells you who's in charge of this whole situation.
[02:28:38.845 --> 02:28:43.211]  Because Biggs saw them basically ordering the police and sheriffs and state police around.
[02:28:43.831 --> 02:28:46.254]  So, the Army's there.
[02:28:47.155 --> 02:28:48.336]  I believe it's the PSYOP.
[02:28:49.039 --> 02:29:04.811]  They're letting the crooks run wild to try to get this stirred up nationwide, and then you run a PSYOP as you stir it up and let it happen, you also demonize all demonstrations going forward, and you legitimize weaponizing the police, federalizing the police, that's the endgame.
[02:29:05.071 --> 02:29:13.477]  Now I'm not saying Delta Force did this this time, but they've done it before, they did it in Seattle, so I'm saying this is suspicious, what do you say?
[02:29:18.533 --> 02:29:20.834]  I'm not going to go to calls because I'm going to break the short segment.
[02:29:20.854 --> 02:29:21.675]  Long segment coming up.
[02:29:21.695 --> 02:29:27.177]  I'm going right to James and then Chris and Jeff and Boris and others.
[02:29:27.197 --> 02:29:27.537]  800-259-9231.
[02:29:27.557 --> 02:29:28.278]  800-259-9231.
[02:29:28.298 --> 02:29:36.702]  We got Boris in Arizona listening or watching on his Roku.
[02:29:37.082 --> 02:29:40.784]  Yeah, you can see the show on Roku and Boxee and a hundred other platforms, literally.
[02:29:40.964 --> 02:29:42.205]  I can't keep track of them all.
[02:29:44.787 --> 02:29:46.748]  I Heart Radio, we're still messing with that.
[02:29:46.768 --> 02:29:50.429]  They called us up and wanted to put us on like six months ago, but we're only on their podcast.
[02:29:50.469 --> 02:29:53.790]  And then we wanted to pick it up live, and we've been monkeying around with that.
[02:29:54.170 --> 02:29:55.251]  We're gonna see what happens with that.
[02:29:56.171 --> 02:29:57.531]  But we're gonna come right back with your calls.
[02:29:57.591 --> 02:29:58.052]  Stay with us.
[02:29:58.872 --> 02:29:59.752]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.272 --> 02:30:01.873]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.793 --> 02:30:05.474]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.526 --> 02:30:11.166]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[02:30:11.486 --> 02:30:15.267]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[02:30:16.007 --> 02:30:20.328]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[02:30:20.468 --> 02:30:27.269]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[02:30:27.769 --> 02:30:36.851]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:30:37.071 --> 02:30:42.534]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[02:30:42.614 --> 02:30:49.878]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.
[02:30:50.199 --> 02:30:52.500]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:30:52.780 --> 02:30:57.923]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the InfoWarp.

[02:31:02.949 --> 02:31:04.231]  DNA Force from InfoWarsLife.
[02:31:09.634 --> 02:31:14.637]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[02:31:14.877 --> 02:31:21.000]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:31:21.200 --> 02:31:28.164]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[02:31:28.504 --> 02:31:38.409]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.
[02:31:39.009 --> 02:31:44.954]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:31:45.174 --> 02:31:49.717]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[02:31:49.998 --> 02:31:53.360]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, lied on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:31:53.600 --> 02:31:55.222]  No needles, no injections.
[02:31:55.502 --> 02:31:56.983]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:31:57.143 --> 02:31:58.204]  Try it for yourself.
[02:31:58.344 --> 02:32:00.326]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.
[02:32:00.646 --> 02:32:05.810]  Secure your revolutionary Secret 12 formula right now at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:32:09.560 --> 02:32:10.780]  Another major health threat.
[02:32:10.820 --> 02:32:15.722]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:32:15.802 --> 02:32:18.423]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:32:18.463 --> 02:32:25.245]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:32:25.505 --> 02:32:28.366]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:32:28.526 --> 02:32:31.447]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:32:31.527 --> 02:32:33.447]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:32:33.487 --> 02:32:36.288]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:32:36.408 --> 02:32:41.890]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:32:42.130 --> 02:32:45.612]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:32:45.632 --> 02:32:48.633]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:32:48.733 --> 02:32:55.816]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[02:33:05.660 --> 02:33:06.360]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:33:06.380 --> 02:33:14.964]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:33:15.064 --> 02:33:20.367]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:37.540 --> 02:33:52.788]  We're going right back to your phone calls.
[02:33:52.808 --> 02:33:57.991]  Then we have this special report where the real Rick Ross calls out the gangsters.
[02:33:59.232 --> 02:34:00.433]  This is a perfect time to play this.
[02:34:00.473 --> 02:34:03.435]  We've had this report ready for about a week, but I want to premiere it here on the radio.
[02:34:04.335 --> 02:34:12.992]  Another video linked up on Infowars.com because this is, you know, first billionaire, you know, ghetto drug dealer for the CIA.
[02:34:13.413 --> 02:34:15.777]  He's repented of it decades ago, went public.
[02:34:16.920 --> 02:34:17.620]  About what happened.
[02:34:17.640 --> 02:34:21.222]  They kept his sentence a lot longer because he stood up against the system.
[02:34:21.282 --> 02:34:33.929]  Rick Ross, that brief interview is coming up, but it's very powerful and it's a challenge to hip-hop that's been weaponized to create this type of nightmare, gangster thug culture that's spreading like a disease into every community.
[02:34:34.710 --> 02:34:36.711]  It is weaponized media on record.
[02:34:37.151 --> 02:34:41.193]  That's coming up here, and then we'll go back to your phone calls, but I'm going to calls here in a moment first.
[02:34:42.234 --> 02:34:43.915]  I told you Secret 12 would sell out.
[02:34:45.660 --> 02:34:57.223]  They eventually came to me and said we got about a hundred bottles left and that it might be a month might be three months till we get more because it's so hard to secure the true organic methylcobalamin that is the organic
[02:34:59.019 --> 02:35:03.280]  Vegan type that is so absorbable compared to other linguals and sublinguals.
[02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:06.341]  That is pills you take by mouth or liquids you take in the mouth.
[02:35:06.721 --> 02:35:09.222]  This is a true nutraceutical at a very low price.
[02:35:09.662 --> 02:35:14.424]  If you want Secret 12, this is your last chance to probably get it and be able to get it by Christmas for sure.
[02:35:14.444 --> 02:35:16.104]  You'll get it way before Christmas.
[02:35:16.144 --> 02:35:16.844]  It's a great gift.
[02:35:17.265 --> 02:35:18.785]  So it'll be gone by today.
[02:35:18.885 --> 02:35:26.667]  Secret 12, 80% methylcobalamin, 20% this other key type that they say mixes with it and does something with the upload as a key enzyme.
[02:35:27.067 --> 02:35:28.348]  I don't understand it all, but
[02:35:28.888 --> 02:35:33.291]  Let me tell you, you want energy that's natural and healthy and doesn't have a hangover, this is it.
[02:35:33.831 --> 02:35:36.213]  Vitamin B12 deficiency is a serious issue.
[02:35:36.533 --> 02:35:37.534]  We've talked a lot about it.
[02:35:38.915 --> 02:35:39.615]  Secret 12.
[02:35:41.096 --> 02:35:46.520]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:35:46.540 --> 02:35:50.322]  And we were out of this for, I don't know, two, three months.
[02:35:50.782 --> 02:35:54.285]  Super high quality colloidal silver, silver bullet.
[02:35:54.685 --> 02:35:57.307]  I don't normally take silver just on a daily basis.
[02:35:58.107 --> 02:36:08.035]  But I've been taking it obviously going into the winter with all these superbugs and the rest of it because I believe and the evidence shows it's going to really give me a leg up against a lot of these resistant bacteria and the rest of it.
[02:36:08.055 --> 02:36:10.256]  That's what I'm personally doing, what my family's doing.
[02:36:10.857 --> 02:36:17.362]  When I couldn't get rid of stuff with antibiotics back in January, it had killed three family members, three family members.
[02:36:19.358 --> 02:36:20.800]  I just chugged several bottles of it.
[02:36:20.820 --> 02:36:21.761]  I'm not saying you should do that.
[02:36:21.801 --> 02:36:22.682]  Consult your physician.
[02:36:23.443 --> 02:36:27.468]  Too much silver, you know, if you drink like five bottles a week for a couple years, your nose might turn blue.
[02:36:27.809 --> 02:36:28.510]  I mean, I'm not kidding.
[02:36:28.910 --> 02:36:30.993]  I mean, it's serious business, though.
[02:36:31.333 --> 02:36:32.875]  And people have done this for thousands of years.
[02:36:33.255 --> 02:36:36.399]  Silver Bullet, at current sales rates, it'll be gone in a week.
[02:36:37.205 --> 02:36:38.485]  And then it'll take months to get it again.
[02:36:39.305 --> 02:36:41.886]  And this is, from our research, the best colloidal silver out there.
[02:36:42.266 --> 02:36:45.847]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:36:45.867 --> 02:36:47.987]  It lasts for years.
[02:36:48.007 --> 02:36:49.507]  It's a great gift to give.
[02:36:50.668 --> 02:36:52.148]  Tell folks, hey, here's some silver.
[02:36:52.188 --> 02:36:52.668]  Look into it.
[02:36:52.728 --> 02:36:55.649]  Topical, antiseptic, antibiotic, you name it.
[02:36:56.149 --> 02:36:57.429]  Topical, bare minimum.
[02:36:57.589 --> 02:37:02.830]  It's known to be one of the only things effective against all this flesh-eating garbage and the rest of it now.
[02:37:03.928 --> 02:37:11.256]  So, InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:37:11.276 --> 02:37:16.061]  And again, the Secret 12 that I'm so proud of, that is going to be gone.
[02:37:16.401 --> 02:37:18.344]  More successful than I even thought it would be.
[02:37:18.704 --> 02:37:20.706]  We did a pretty big run of it for our first run.
[02:37:21.947 --> 02:37:26.670]  So again, Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:37:26.690 --> 02:37:33.173]  Your purchases supports us having reporters spend eight, nine days, ten days, it'll be in Ferguson.
[02:37:33.653 --> 02:37:35.334]  It supports us sending people to Bilderberg.
[02:37:35.654 --> 02:37:37.155]  It supports us sending folks to the border.
[02:37:37.355 --> 02:37:39.636]  We're building a real news organization here.
[02:37:41.357 --> 02:37:45.239]  With all of our great crew and writers and researchers, that takes a lot of money.
[02:37:45.740 --> 02:37:47.961]  So we don't take taxpayer money like MSNBC or
[02:37:49.557 --> 02:37:50.998]  You know, things like NPR.
[02:37:51.058 --> 02:38:03.045]  We get it by selling ProGun t-shirts, or Made in America George Washington belt buckles, or Molon Labe, and just so many other products that we think are cool, and you've agreed and supported us, so thank you.
[02:38:03.305 --> 02:38:04.125]  We're all in this together.
[02:38:04.365 --> 02:38:06.847]  Please support our local AM and FM affiliates as well.
[02:38:07.727 --> 02:38:10.429]  Become sponsors, support the sponsors, let the station know.
[02:38:10.949 --> 02:38:13.751]  I haven't even plugged this yet because I'm going to do a TV ad for it, a radio ad.
[02:38:14.531 --> 02:38:16.994]  We sold out of two forms of the Molon Labe.
[02:38:17.295 --> 02:38:19.457]  We only print 500 of each, made in America.
[02:38:19.878 --> 02:38:21.700]  Well, they're forged of brass.
[02:38:22.822 --> 02:38:23.883]  One of them is nickel covered.
[02:38:23.903 --> 02:38:25.364]  Those are a little bit more expensive.
[02:38:26.545 --> 02:38:27.445]  We have limited edition.
[02:38:27.605 --> 02:38:28.786]  These are only 500 of each.
[02:38:29.086 --> 02:38:38.352]  We have a Molon Labe with an M16 belt buckle and a Molon Labe 50 cal Centurion or actually it's a Greek Spartan.
[02:38:39.193 --> 02:38:40.174]  Those are now available.
[02:38:40.414 --> 02:38:44.917]  You notice we sold out of the camouflage shirts that I basically came up with a design for.
[02:38:45.537 --> 02:38:46.538]  We sold out of so many.
[02:38:46.838 --> 02:38:50.641]  We will sell out very quickly of the new limited edition
[02:38:52.287 --> 02:38:58.989]  Molon Labe belt buckles, 500 of each, info or store.com or madein1776.com.
[02:38:59.349 --> 02:39:06.351]  This company is out on the West Coast, Oregon, and it is a veteran-owned operation that hires veterans.
[02:39:07.011 --> 02:39:10.772]  And you notice the other group, we started selling the Navy SEAL made
[02:39:12.170 --> 02:39:13.271]  Hey Alex, can you hear me okay?
[02:39:42.486 --> 02:39:43.847]  No, no, no worries, dude.
[02:39:43.887 --> 02:39:44.848]  Your rants are amazing.
[02:39:45.209 --> 02:39:45.769]  Oh, come on.
[02:39:45.929 --> 02:39:49.112]  I have a few points I'd like to go over real quick if that's cool.
[02:39:49.212 --> 02:39:49.733]  Go ahead, brother.
[02:39:51.094 --> 02:39:51.614]  All right.
[02:39:52.595 --> 02:39:54.577]  First of all, fantastic show.
[02:39:55.178 --> 02:39:56.759]  You're promoting it amazingly well.
[02:39:57.140 --> 02:39:58.221]  News organization, everything.
[02:39:58.921 --> 02:40:01.824]  I'd like to talk with a guest, so please have a conversation with me.
[02:40:03.045 --> 02:40:05.407]  Ferguson, they have a lot of things they need to do.
[02:40:05.647 --> 02:40:06.028]  You're right.
[02:40:06.048 --> 02:40:07.249]  They have a lot of
[02:40:08.332 --> 02:40:09.352]  Conflict on both sides.
[02:40:10.173 --> 02:40:15.134]  The police, the rioters, they're both using this in a way to push an agenda.
[02:40:15.154 --> 02:40:15.494]  You're right, 100%.
[02:40:15.855 --> 02:40:18.535]  Well, I don't think the police are.
[02:40:19.296 --> 02:40:22.097]  The politicians commanding the police are.
[02:40:23.757 --> 02:40:24.758]  Yeah, I agree 100%.
[02:40:24.818 --> 02:40:27.498]  All of these callers that you're having are fantastic.
[02:40:27.518 --> 02:40:28.579]  They're touching on these things.
[02:40:28.919 --> 02:40:33.400]  We don't know who's doing what, but there's clearly an agenda being pushed on both sides.
[02:40:33.500 --> 02:40:34.941]  Everybody can see that, right?
[02:40:36.004 --> 02:40:38.405]  Yes, and my agenda is live in a free country.
[02:40:40.026 --> 02:40:40.967]  Exactly, me too.
[02:40:41.487 --> 02:40:45.849]  I have a pretty interesting story about the last week of my life, if you'd like to hear it.
[02:40:46.009 --> 02:40:46.990]  Sure, go ahead, real quick.
[02:40:48.111 --> 02:40:56.215]  Okay, I got mugged, I almost got mugged on Monday, and I had my firearm on me, and then the next day, police confiscated it.
[02:40:56.455 --> 02:40:58.256]  And I'll go into that in detail if you have time.
[02:40:59.537 --> 02:41:03.599]  Oh wow, so you defended yourself, or threatened, well yeah, I mean, tell the story.
[02:41:04.830 --> 02:41:08.000]  Okay, okay, so it's a little bit of a story, but bear with me.
[02:41:09.734 --> 02:41:13.175]  I was approached by two people in a very suspicious way.
[02:41:13.195 --> 02:41:14.696]  I had my registered pistol on me.
[02:41:15.116 --> 02:41:16.676]  I didn't pull it out, anything like that.
[02:41:17.117 --> 02:41:19.117]  I got the feeling like they were going to mug me.
[02:41:19.657 --> 02:41:24.219]  And I talked them down, basically, didn't even show that I had a pistol.
[02:41:24.739 --> 02:41:26.119]  And we both went on our ways.
[02:41:26.520 --> 02:41:34.202]  And the next day, two police officers in the city where I live confiscated my pistol from me, violated my Second and Fourth Amendment rights.
[02:41:34.562 --> 02:41:36.023]  There's so much stuff going on, man.
[02:41:36.083 --> 02:41:36.343]  I'm just...
[02:41:36.863 --> 02:41:40.045]  Yeah, well, California has a soft, cold war against guns.
[02:41:40.645 --> 02:41:43.466]  Even Bloomberg had the headline, you know, confiscation begins.
[02:41:43.987 --> 02:41:45.688]  They're taking them from veterans, you name it.
[02:41:46.088 --> 02:41:48.649]  And so what were the people like, hey, nice watch, why don't you give it to me?
[02:41:48.729 --> 02:41:52.531]  Or, I mean, was it that kind of soft mugging that you see so much?
[02:41:53.071 --> 02:41:54.792]  Or describe what you did.
[02:41:54.812 --> 02:41:55.853]  I mean, how did they back down?
[02:41:55.893 --> 02:41:56.853]  Did you tell them you had a gun?
[02:41:58.414 --> 02:41:58.934]  No, I didn't.
[02:41:58.954 --> 02:42:03.677]  These guys were like 18, 19, I guess, maybe Hispanic mixed.
[02:42:04.339 --> 02:42:07.582]  Uh, they look like they're a bunch of wannabe thugs from the area, you know what I mean?
[02:42:08.643 --> 02:42:11.245]  Uh, they come up to me and say, hey, what are you posted up here for?
[02:42:11.265 --> 02:42:12.946]  I'm like, it's none of your business.
[02:42:13.186 --> 02:42:13.967]  Why are you asking?
[02:42:14.187 --> 02:42:22.653]  And all this stuff, and they got really confrontational, and I tried to cool down, didn't go for my pistol, but I had their feet, and talked them both dead, and then they walked away.
[02:42:23.274 --> 02:42:24.154]  That's pretty much how it went.
[02:42:24.255 --> 02:42:27.637]  Now, now, now, I mean, you say they confiscated it.
[02:42:27.657 --> 02:42:28.938]  Have they opened an investigation?
[02:42:28.958 --> 02:42:30.920]  Did they just say, give me your gun?
[02:42:32.318 --> 02:42:36.219]  Okay, so I'm sitting in my car and they come up on me real quick.
[02:42:36.239 --> 02:42:37.500]  I need to get out of the car.
[02:42:37.660 --> 02:42:38.600]  My pistol's on my hip.
[02:42:39.301 --> 02:42:40.141]  And I comply.
[02:42:40.161 --> 02:42:41.381]  I agree.
[02:42:41.661 --> 02:42:42.922]  I'm not law-abiding 100%.
[02:42:42.962 --> 02:42:43.502]  I understand.
[02:42:43.762 --> 02:42:46.023]  Go ahead and finish the story.
[02:42:47.296 --> 02:42:49.517]  And they asked me if I have anything.
[02:42:49.697 --> 02:42:50.437]  I have my pistol.
[02:42:51.057 --> 02:42:53.717]  And they find it and they're surprised that I'm honest with them.
[02:42:54.218 --> 02:43:00.379]  Long story short, they give me a misdemeanor for carrying a loaded firearm in California because it's a police state in the UN.
[02:43:01.139 --> 02:43:01.699]  All that stuff.
[02:43:01.719 --> 02:43:02.479]  No, I understand.
[02:43:02.659 --> 02:43:05.680]  Listen, you need to go fight that.
[02:43:05.700 --> 02:43:07.000]  You need to get your firearm back.
[02:43:07.300 --> 02:43:08.481]  You need to fight that case.
[02:43:09.101 --> 02:43:10.141]  I appreciate your call.
[02:43:10.841 --> 02:43:13.942]  Now I'm going to go ahead and go to this Rick Ross story report.
[02:43:14.915 --> 02:43:19.619]  And again, this is a man who travels the country now telling young people don't use drugs.
[02:43:20.680 --> 02:43:23.282]  This is a guy traveling saying don't be into gangster culture.
[02:43:24.282 --> 02:43:28.226]  This is a guy exposing gangster rap.
[02:43:29.048 --> 02:43:32.170]  Who is an icon in that whole culture.
[02:43:32.450 --> 02:43:33.970]  He never asked to be, they made him one.
[02:43:34.030 --> 02:43:37.152]  One of the top rappers took his identity, calls himself Rick Ross.
[02:43:37.732 --> 02:43:42.254]  So he's reaching out to Rick Ross saying you could save tens of millions of people.
[02:43:42.274 --> 02:43:44.175]  You could try to turn this around.
[02:43:44.696 --> 02:43:45.716]  They've weaponized it.
[02:43:45.776 --> 02:43:49.438]  Just like the CIA admits they infiltrated rock and roll to create rebellion.
[02:43:51.920 --> 02:43:53.361]  Now they've done this with hip-hop.
[02:43:53.781 --> 02:43:54.842]  They've gangsterized it.
[02:43:54.862 --> 02:43:56.243]  They've weaponized it worldwide.
[02:43:56.563 --> 02:43:58.564]  Here is Rick Ross's special report.
[02:43:58.845 --> 02:44:03.007]  We're going to have it reposted to InfoWars.com right now in the tile section.
[02:44:03.267 --> 02:44:04.228]  We're going to tweet it out.
[02:44:04.768 --> 02:44:07.390]  And I want everybody to tweet it at the fake Rick Ross.
[02:44:07.930 --> 02:44:09.231]  And so we'll have his Twitter up there.
[02:44:09.251 --> 02:44:13.134]  I'll have Lewis put it out on the real Alex Jones on Twitter in the next 20 minutes.
[02:44:14.435 --> 02:44:16.276]  Send this as a Twitter bomb.
[02:44:17.637 --> 02:44:18.637]  I'm the real Rick Ross.
[02:44:39.139 --> 02:44:40.861]  Today, there's a new epidemic.
[02:44:41.181 --> 02:44:42.242]  Smokable cocaine.
[02:44:42.723 --> 02:44:44.124]  Otherwise known as crack.
[02:44:44.885 --> 02:44:51.572]  I will tell you, Director Deutch, as a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective, that the agency has dealt drugs throughout this country for a long time.
[02:44:52.970 --> 02:44:58.531]  The CIA used him as a pawn to sell drugs to help fund the secret war in Nicaragua.
[02:44:58.711 --> 02:45:02.432]  Illegal cocaine is coming into our country at alarming levels.
[02:45:02.872 --> 02:45:07.653]  He was a 1980's drug lord who became a multi-millionaire urban legend in Los Angeles.
[02:45:08.074 --> 02:45:11.254]  A rap star even stole his name and parlayed it into a music career.
[02:45:13.115 --> 02:45:14.675]  I'm your neighborhood drug dealer!
[02:45:14.795 --> 02:45:15.555]  Drug dealer!
[02:45:15.775 --> 02:45:18.716]  It's your neighborhood drug dealer!
[02:45:18.956 --> 02:45:20.456]  Hey, you see Rick Rouse in there?
[02:45:20.757 --> 02:45:21.217]  Rick Rouse!
[02:45:21.237 --> 02:45:22.577]  The real Rick Rouse!
[02:45:23.086 --> 02:45:30.251]  To William Roberts, aka Rick Ross, who's using my name, I'm inviting you in to come with me.
[02:45:31.012 --> 02:45:32.052]  Let's fight this culture.
[02:45:32.773 --> 02:45:36.375]  Let's fight this penitentiary culture that hip-hop's been spreading.
[02:45:37.236 --> 02:45:38.017]  Let's make a difference.
[02:45:38.497 --> 02:45:46.402]  Me and you need to come together, and you need to tell them that you didn't make your money selling drugs, and making music is how you became famous.
[02:45:46.422 --> 02:45:48.384]  See, there's nothing wrong with making music.
[02:45:48.784 --> 02:45:52.547]  Just like there's nothing wrong with being a correctional officer, if that's what you did.
[02:45:53.843 --> 02:46:05.134]  But so many of our friends who look up to you and look up to me are out on the streets thinking that they can go out and sell drugs and parlay that into a record career.
[02:46:07.236 --> 02:46:16.825]  I don't know if you know that they're not gonna make it, but I know that they're gonna wind up in prison with prison sentences three and four times what they should be.
[02:46:17.856 --> 02:46:19.617]  Because this war on drugs is no joke.
[02:46:20.758 --> 02:46:25.982]  I have 10 or 11 friends still in prison right now with life sentences.
[02:46:27.242 --> 02:46:29.224]  Including one that even you know, Big Meech.
[02:46:30.645 --> 02:46:32.626]  I know how much you respect me and care about me.
[02:46:32.966 --> 02:46:34.247]  Otherwise, you wouldn't have took my name.
[02:46:36.368 --> 02:46:37.389]  Take a chance with me now.
[02:46:39.010 --> 02:46:39.851]  Let's make a difference.
[02:46:40.431 --> 02:46:45.895]  And even if William Roberts, aka Rick Ross, don't decide to come with me and join hands,
[02:46:47.406 --> 02:46:50.347]  Then the rest of the artists out there, let's us come together.
[02:46:52.288 --> 02:46:55.969]  Professor Griff, KRS-One, and so forth.
[02:46:57.150 --> 02:46:58.010]  Let's join hands.
[02:46:58.771 --> 02:47:00.491]  Let's change this thug culture.
[02:47:01.011 --> 02:47:04.893]  Let's change this hip-hop to prison pipeline.
[02:47:06.714 --> 02:47:07.494]  Let's make it happen.
[02:47:08.234 --> 02:47:08.995]  Right now, today.
[02:47:09.235 --> 02:47:09.795]  Let's do it.
[02:47:10.515 --> 02:47:12.256]  And not just you, the whole hip-hop community.
[02:47:12.776 --> 02:47:13.717]  I'm asking all of you.
[02:47:14.297 --> 02:47:15.497]  Let's all of us come together.
[02:47:15.797 --> 02:47:16.778]  Let's change these laws.
[02:47:17.785 --> 02:47:20.127]  Right now and in this senseless war on drugs.
[02:47:21.388 --> 02:47:34.599]  A lot of times we go through life and we start to believe that the things that we're experiencing in our life and the things that we see in our communities are the only way it is.
[02:47:35.679 --> 02:47:37.301]  Like, this the way it is.
[02:47:37.641 --> 02:47:38.642]  This the way it's supposed to be.
[02:47:39.842 --> 02:47:43.504]  And when you start to think like that, you can get trapped in a box.
[02:47:44.264 --> 02:47:45.605]  Hip-hop has taken over the world.
[02:47:46.205 --> 02:47:49.447]  If we can take hip-hop back, we can change the whole planet.
[02:47:50.247 --> 02:47:53.088]  We can bring real peace and no more war.
[02:47:53.929 --> 02:47:54.889]  Let's be pioneers.
[02:47:56.530 --> 02:48:02.773]  Let's be talked about forever for how we change the way society thinks about each other.
[02:48:03.133 --> 02:48:04.874]  It don't have to always be a war on drugs.
[02:48:05.134 --> 02:48:07.075]  If we can educate ourselves to where
[02:48:08.505 --> 02:48:15.070]  Our kids and our brothers and our sisters and our mothers and our fathers look at drugs the way we look at rat poison.
[02:48:15.570 --> 02:48:20.994]  You know, we just don't go around using rat poison and other chemicals that's harmful to our body.
[02:48:21.374 --> 02:48:28.179]  If we teach our people how to not use drugs the same way, then eventually we don't have to worry about them using drugs.
[02:48:28.980 --> 02:48:32.402]  Now you may never have heard of some of these stars, but your kids have.
[02:48:33.162 --> 02:48:35.304]  They're heroes to a whole new generation.
[02:48:36.024 --> 02:48:37.886]  Now they take these guys and these guys say, well,
[02:48:39.350 --> 02:48:43.271]  I got to the position that I'm in right now today by selling drugs.
[02:48:43.971 --> 02:48:54.634]  So the message that it tells our kids is that if you go out, you sell drugs, then you can become a great rock star like myself and never go to prison.
[02:48:55.734 --> 02:49:01.055]  And I think that that's a false message to be giving people who feel hopeless.
[02:49:01.696 --> 02:49:07.377]  I'm letting you know right now that the establishment is using hip-hop
[02:49:08.336 --> 02:49:13.877]  To prime these kids for a life that's gonna send them to prison, just like they did with me.
[02:49:14.698 --> 02:49:29.541]  See, when I was coming up, there was Superfly, Tequila Sunrise, Square Face, all these movies to make you think that you could start with nothing, and then you could have the whole world at the palm of your hand.
[02:49:31.382 --> 02:49:33.602]  Only that there was no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
[02:49:34.922 --> 02:49:37.283]  It was a set of handcuffs and shackles.
[02:49:38.240 --> 02:49:40.520]  And you want to know why the CIA symbol is behind me?
[02:49:40.540 --> 02:49:44.101]  Because they were the guys behind me when I was selling drugs.
[02:49:44.781 --> 02:49:48.822]  And now, they're behind hip-hop and rock and roll.
[02:49:50.222 --> 02:49:55.243]  This prison, hip-hop connection, they're behind that too.
[02:49:56.124 --> 02:49:59.844]  If it was good for them to sell drugs, then it should have been good for me to sell drugs.
[02:50:00.064 --> 02:50:03.625]  The money from the drugs went to buy guns for the country.
[02:50:04.345 --> 02:50:07.646]  Even if you don't read my book, warn your kids.
[02:50:08.524 --> 02:50:09.105]  Let them know.
[02:50:10.426 --> 02:50:12.408]  But I advise you that this book is worth reading.
[02:50:13.009 --> 02:50:13.930]  Definitely for your kids.
[02:50:13.990 --> 02:50:16.133]  Even if you don't read it, get it for your kids.
[02:50:16.173 --> 02:50:17.194]  Get it for your loved ones.
[02:50:17.714 --> 02:50:19.857]  Let them see what the drug culture is all about.
[02:50:20.798 --> 02:50:25.062]  It's not manufactured like the stuff you see on TV and you hear in music.
[02:50:25.903 --> 02:50:26.744]  This is real life.
[02:50:27.805 --> 02:50:28.426]  It's your life.
[02:50:29.087 --> 02:50:29.908]  Your loved one's life.
[02:50:31.380 --> 02:50:32.220]  Let's make a difference.
[02:50:33.161 --> 02:50:34.041]  You know where to find me.
[02:50:34.542 --> 02:50:35.262]  FreewayRicky.
[02:50:35.582 --> 02:50:37.323]  Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.
[02:50:37.623 --> 02:50:38.884]  FreewayRick.com.
[02:50:39.244 --> 02:50:39.724]  Hit me up.
[02:50:40.505 --> 02:50:41.225]  You know I'm out here.
[02:50:41.845 --> 02:50:45.887]  Yeah, it's very important that I redeem myself for the wrongs that I've done.
[02:50:45.907 --> 02:50:56.533]  And I feel that the way that I can redeem myself the best is by helping others not fall in the same footsteps that I fell in.
[02:50:56.993 --> 02:50:59.014]  Because I believe that it's a trap.
[02:50:59.974 --> 02:51:00.955]  It's a trap to catch you.
[02:51:02.446 --> 02:51:08.227]  Yeah, just cause you're doing bad and you're looking for a way to make an income.
[02:51:09.127 --> 02:51:14.948]  There's people that'll take your freedom forever and ever.
[02:51:14.968 --> 02:51:16.449]  Don't make the same mistake I made.
[02:51:17.049 --> 02:51:17.769]  Don't get caught up.
[02:51:19.389 --> 02:51:20.830]  It's time for us to wake up and face it.
[02:51:22.390 --> 02:51:25.010]  Get the truth and you're done.
[02:51:30.114 --> 02:51:34.418]  Well, that's an extremely powerful little 7-8 minute investigative report.
[02:51:35.499 --> 02:51:37.581]  It's powerful audibly, if you're a radio listener.
[02:51:37.681 --> 02:51:41.785]  It's very powerful, the video of him speaking to high school and college students.
[02:51:42.346 --> 02:51:52.175]  Just while he was here in Texas, Josh Owens shot all those pieces with Rob Dewey helping some and traveled around Texas for four or five days with Rick Ross.
[02:51:52.595 --> 02:51:57.738]  Josh Owens has been here less than a year now from the Carolinas and is just doing a fabulous job.
[02:51:58.199 --> 02:52:05.764]  There's so many people behind the scenes here at Infowars, like Josh Owens, who's been shot at by the rubber bullets and Bennett, the whole standoff with the Bundys.
[02:52:05.884 --> 02:52:09.666]  I mean, our reporters really are like wartime reporters now.
[02:52:10.567 --> 02:52:11.267]  And our camera people.
[02:52:11.567 --> 02:52:12.368]  This is not a joke.
[02:52:13.348 --> 02:52:14.049]  This is not a game.
[02:52:16.547 --> 02:52:22.489]  But I used to go out in the field a lot more than I do now, because I have to literally be here and make the decisions and run things like a general.
[02:52:22.949 --> 02:52:31.271]  Doesn't mean I didn't spend years out there as a private, right up through a sergeant, you know, right up to general, basically, in the info war in our own sector.
[02:52:32.672 --> 02:52:39.214]  The reason I don't go out in public a lot is there's no amount of security, folks, that will stop the stuff they've already tried.
[02:52:40.800 --> 02:52:43.601]  I don't want to be dramatic here, but it's real bad.
[02:52:44.942 --> 02:52:48.883]  Anybody wants to wonder what's really going on or how real this is, believe me, it's real.
[02:52:49.764 --> 02:52:50.304]  Believe me.
[02:52:51.764 --> 02:52:56.506]  And that's another reason that I know that there's a mix of people in the system.
[02:52:57.127 --> 02:53:00.288]  The evil's not just in the government or not just in the corporations, it's in us.
[02:53:00.688 --> 02:53:01.608]  Just like the goods there.
[02:53:02.569 --> 02:53:09.912]  And I know for a fact some of our best intel's come from the FBI, from federal marshals, from state police, from the Austin Police Department.
[02:53:10.720 --> 02:53:11.100]  I don't know.
[02:53:32.009 --> 02:53:40.235]  It's black and white when it comes to communism being absolutely horrible, or the Second Amendment being key to freedom, or family being key, or vaccines, you can't trust them.
[02:53:40.535 --> 02:53:51.903]  But when it comes to just saying black people are all gang-banging criminals, or cops are all scum, it's all about dividing us, and it's coming together with good, wholesome messages.
[02:53:52.563 --> 02:53:53.244]  That are truthful.
[02:53:53.484 --> 02:53:57.667]  You're not going to keep people off drugs, telling them, that'll kill you the first time you try it, blah, blah, blah.
[02:53:57.707 --> 02:54:02.250]  You know, you teach them, hey, it's being shipped in by foreign banks that run the government at the top.
[02:54:03.131 --> 02:54:05.933]  They're doing it to make slavery legal in the modern time.
[02:54:07.334 --> 02:54:08.175]  Don't be part of it.
[02:54:09.576 --> 02:54:14.379]  But see, instead, the media can manipulate the inner city as its practice ground and have folks burn down their own neighborhood.
[02:54:16.661 --> 02:54:17.362]  And it's sad.
[02:54:18.973 --> 02:54:27.716]  It doesn't make me feel good to be able to look at a group of people who've been manipulated and watch them fall down and then feel good about myself that I'm not part of that quote group.
[02:54:27.976 --> 02:54:28.596]  I'm a human being.
[02:54:28.636 --> 02:54:29.436]  I'm part of that group.
[02:54:30.617 --> 02:54:36.418]  That's why folks are always sending me anti-semitic stuff and saying they want to kill me and I'm Jewish and all this stuff.
[02:54:36.458 --> 02:54:36.999]  I go, you know what?
[02:54:37.059 --> 02:54:37.679]  I am Jewish.
[02:54:39.159 --> 02:54:39.479]  You bet.
[02:54:39.519 --> 02:54:40.220]  I'm Jewish.
[02:54:40.660 --> 02:54:41.240]  You bet I am.
[02:54:41.480 --> 02:54:42.680]  Of course, I'm not Jewish.
[02:54:43.360 --> 02:54:43.901]  But you know what?
[02:54:43.981 --> 02:54:47.902]  You want to use that as a slang, as some kind of evil thing, because I'm not anti-semitic?
[02:54:48.789 --> 02:54:52.893]  Like that makes you better than me because you just want to call me using the pejorative or kike or whatever?
[02:54:53.574 --> 02:54:58.218]  I take it as a badge of honor that I'm more attacked by white supremacists
[02:55:08.140 --> 02:55:10.903]  than anybody in the world when you go online.
[02:55:11.543 --> 02:55:13.405]  You can see the aggregates on Google searches.
[02:55:13.725 --> 02:55:14.446]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:55:14.906 --> 02:55:19.871]  Who do you think runs the groups that are putting out the K-word and the N-word and the division?
[02:55:19.951 --> 02:55:23.935]  It's the tiny globalists that want to play everybody off against each other.
[02:55:25.151 --> 02:55:31.376]  So that they can get us all wanting peace so bad, that we'll let them ban the n-word, or ban the k-word.
[02:55:32.296 --> 02:55:35.619]  And then once they've banned those words, they can ban the word mom or dad.
[02:55:35.639 --> 02:55:37.500]  And you're like, what are you not gonna ban that?
[02:55:37.720 --> 02:55:40.963]  They're already in Europe and the US banning it in government documents.
[02:55:41.403 --> 02:55:43.344]  They're already banning brown bags in Seattle.
[02:55:43.564 --> 02:55:44.825]  Don't say brown bag, it's racist.
[02:55:44.845 --> 02:55:46.246]  Brown bag, brown bag, brown bag.
[02:55:46.487 --> 02:55:49.569]  It's not words that are evil, it's how they're used.
[02:55:51.903 --> 02:55:55.386]  So the fact that a bunch of globalists run white supremacists want me dead?
[02:55:56.386 --> 02:55:57.347]  Badge of honor.
[02:55:58.007 --> 02:56:03.912]  The fact that the ADL that protects real Nazis like George Soros hates me and lies about me?
[02:56:04.012 --> 02:56:04.912]  Badge of courage.
[02:56:06.133 --> 02:56:07.494]  See, because I just tell the truth.
[02:56:07.794 --> 02:56:08.795]  My job isn't hard.
[02:56:09.516 --> 02:56:11.917]  Israel attacks the USS Liberty trying to sink the ship?
[02:56:12.698 --> 02:56:13.478]  To blame it on Egypt?
[02:56:13.638 --> 02:56:14.779]  I expose the false flag.
[02:56:14.799 --> 02:56:16.801]  Because Israel isn't a sacred cow.
[02:56:17.241 --> 02:56:19.743]  Israel's arrogant, like all these other governments.
[02:56:21.840 --> 02:56:24.861]  Why do you think I have the Saudi Arabian government talking trash about me?
[02:56:25.782 --> 02:56:27.203]  They got their people creeping around here.
[02:56:28.063 --> 02:56:30.224]  Because we're having an effect, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:30.544 --> 02:56:31.825]  We know what's going on.
[02:56:32.065 --> 02:56:32.965]  We're accurate.
[02:56:33.225 --> 02:56:34.886]  We really are telling people the truth.
[02:56:35.647 --> 02:56:38.388]  As close to it as you're going to get, because I promise I don't have all the answers.
[02:56:41.189 --> 02:56:42.670]  I didn't mean to go off on a whole jag.
[02:56:42.690 --> 02:56:48.633]  It's just that I can't sit back and feel good about 52% of black people never being born.
[02:56:49.818 --> 02:56:58.508]  I can't sit back about Mexican girls being forcibly inoculated with Gardasil that's known to basically reduce their fertility and give them autoimmune disorders.
[02:56:59.965 --> 02:57:22.442]  Even if the giant hordes of uneducated people are being used as dumbed-down political weapons against me and my family, even though maybe 30% of black people are raving racist, in my experience, and absolutely would slit my throat if they could get away with it, I won't sit there and say, good, kill all their babies before they get out of them, because I will not sign on to dehumanization.
[02:57:22.782 --> 02:57:24.603]  And that's not being a hero, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:57:24.923 --> 02:57:26.665]  That is common sense.
[02:57:29.395 --> 02:57:39.343]  If you won't stand up for justice across the board, regardless of what color somebody is, or what their religion is, you're not going to get justice when it comes time for you to get it.
[02:57:40.104 --> 02:57:43.767]  And that's what I'm telling the police out there in these corrupt cities, corrupt counties.
[02:57:44.127 --> 02:57:45.609]  You thinking you're good old boy network?
[02:57:47.149 --> 02:57:51.371]  You're going to get away with doing bad things to people and it's not going to come back on you and your family?
[02:57:51.651 --> 02:57:52.671]  Here's another little message.
[02:57:53.151 --> 02:57:57.733]  You people that are into evil, it comes back on your family, not just on you.
[02:57:57.753 --> 02:58:00.094]  So I didn't mean to go off on a jag rant.
[02:58:00.134 --> 02:58:03.015]  I'm going to go to break, come back and go to Chris in Florida who's been holding.
[02:58:03.935 --> 02:58:05.616]  I don't even read these comments.
[02:58:05.676 --> 02:58:06.036]  I should have.
[02:58:06.076 --> 02:58:07.936]  Black Panther, Obama, race wars.
[02:58:07.956 --> 02:58:08.917]  We'll see what he has to say.
[02:58:09.917 --> 02:58:12.178]  We'll talk to Boris in Arizona.
[02:58:13.163 --> 02:58:16.285]  Beth in Arizona, Rick in Pennsylvania, Jason in Texas.
[02:58:16.625 --> 02:58:19.848]  I'm going to do at least 30 minutes of overdrive in here.
[02:58:20.328 --> 02:58:28.634]  And then if David Knight wants to do it, I know he was up last night, I'd like him to finish out the hour with his take on what he saw yesterday and keep taking your calls.
[02:58:28.974 --> 02:58:33.777]  I'd do a whole hour of overdrive, but I got a bunch of stuff I got to do for the nightly news and a bunch of other things.
[02:58:34.117 --> 02:58:36.779]  But I think we'll do an hour of overdrive here coming up.
[02:58:36.799 --> 02:58:40.442]  Let's go see if David Knight wants to get suited up and come in here and take these phone calls.
[02:58:40.982 --> 02:58:44.846]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, your calls are 70 seconds away.
[02:58:45.526 --> 02:58:47.888]  I'm Alex Jones, broadcasting from Austin, Texas.
[02:58:47.928 --> 02:58:49.169]  Our reporters are in Ferguson.
[02:58:49.330 --> 02:58:50.491]  They'll be there tonight.
[02:58:50.571 --> 02:58:52.232]  Free feeds at Infowars.com.
[02:58:53.153 --> 02:58:55.335]  Fourth Hour of Overdrive coming up.
[02:58:55.455 --> 02:58:56.396]  Some stations don't carry it.
[02:58:59.472 --> 02:59:08.998]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[02:59:09.138 --> 02:59:18.883]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[02:59:19.063 --> 02:59:21.985]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[02:59:22.125 --> 02:59:22.385]  I think so.
[02:59:37.222 --> 02:59:38.443]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:21.830 --> 03:00:22.751]  Fix bayonets.
[03:00:23.351 --> 03:00:30.354]  We are now entering overdrive with your host, Alex Jones, broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:00:30.915 --> 03:00:34.616]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:36.457 --> 03:00:47.463]  Yeah, the racist New Black Panther Party hates me.
[03:00:48.479 --> 03:00:49.740]  The white supremacists hate me.
[03:00:50.780 --> 03:00:52.521]  And the globalists that run the government hate me.
[03:00:53.482 --> 03:00:54.542]  Federal Reserve hates me.
[03:00:55.363 --> 03:00:56.203]  White House hates me.
[03:00:56.243 --> 03:00:57.864]  That must mean I'm doing a pretty good job here.
[03:00:58.324 --> 03:00:59.505]  Whole hour of overdrive.
[03:00:59.525 --> 03:01:00.926]  Some stations carried the fourth hour.
[03:01:00.946 --> 03:01:01.986]  I did four hours for years.
[03:01:02.326 --> 03:01:03.847]  I did three hours for like 12 years.
[03:01:03.867 --> 03:01:06.669]  Then I did four hours for about five years.
[03:01:07.930 --> 03:01:14.998]  Last few years, I have quit that and gone back to three because it's just I'm too exhausted to finish all the administrative and research stuff after doing four hours.
[03:01:15.058 --> 03:01:18.422]  But today, I want to take call after call after call.
[03:01:19.303 --> 03:01:20.504]  I'll go to about 20 after.
[03:01:20.524 --> 03:01:24.308]  If David Knight wants to do it, he can come in for 40 minutes and take your calls and give his take.
[03:01:24.368 --> 03:01:26.671]  Chris in Florida, thank you so much for holding.
[03:01:26.691 --> 03:01:27.732]  We appreciate you joining us.
[03:01:28.939 --> 03:01:46.426]  Well, Alex, you do tend to underestimate the assessment of the situation sometimes, and I know I called about the new Black Panther Party, but on hold you mentioned that fluoride negatively impacts blacks, and it's actually five to six times worse than whites, and about three times for Mexican-Americans.
[03:01:46.506 --> 03:01:47.186]  I know, I know.
[03:01:47.226 --> 03:01:49.187]  I was going with a very conservative estimate.
[03:01:49.207 --> 03:01:49.547]  You're right.
[03:01:50.060 --> 03:02:09.536]  Sure, and that's the CDC and Dartmouth College, so yeah, you know, just keep on showing your concern for the black community, like Reverend Elvita King, who's the daughter of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and his niece, his daughter is Bernice, and his niece is Elvita, who say water fluoridation is a civil right.
[03:02:09.556 --> 03:02:10.456]  That's right.
[03:02:10.476 --> 03:02:10.597]  And St.
[03:02:10.617 --> 03:02:12.058]  Louis County is being fluoridated.
[03:02:12.078 --> 03:02:14.680]  That's right, we've had her on the show, you're right.
[03:02:15.307 --> 03:02:15.567]  Great.
[03:02:16.148 --> 03:02:27.605]  And, you know, because it causes more criminality due to higher lead uptake, and sincere black leaders would be covering these kinds of things that you... Yeah, no, it makes you mentally ill and aggressive.
[03:02:28.466 --> 03:02:30.369]  Just like we saw Mr. Brown acting.
[03:02:31.508 --> 03:02:31.828]  Indeed.
[03:02:32.229 --> 03:02:36.053]  And yeah, we should do a hair mineral analysis and see what the deal is with that.
[03:02:36.454 --> 03:02:44.744]  Now as for the New Black Panther Party, go to theobamafile.com and in the search bar enter Shabazz, S-H-A-B-A-Z-Z.
[03:02:45.144 --> 03:02:47.387]  That's the National Director of the New Black Panther Party.
[03:02:47.807 --> 03:02:49.970]  And you'll see back in 2007 in Selma, Alabama,
[03:02:51.952 --> 03:03:04.787]  He made a campaign stop supporting Senator Obama, and you can see the photos with a uniform from Breitbart, with another uniformed New Black Panther Party member, along with Malik Zulu Shabazz.
[03:03:05.248 --> 03:03:10.594]  And in 2008, on Obama's own website, he thanked the endorsement from the New Black Panther Party.
[03:03:13.045 --> 03:03:27.155]  It's really amazing that they won't even give out the White House login sheet to say whether Malik Shabazz, who visited the White House several times, is the same as Malik Zulu Shabazz, the National Director of the New Pinko-Pansy Party.
[03:03:28.176 --> 03:03:37.542]  Now, we have Michelle Williams, if you remember, called for a bounty on George Zimmerman, just as a bounty has been called for on Darren Wilson.
[03:03:38.440 --> 03:03:52.645]  And Michelle Williams of the former Chief of Staff for the Tampa New Black Panther Party, locally here on a community-sponsored radio station, it's actually only about 70% community-sponsored it turns out, called the WMNF.
[03:03:52.725 --> 03:03:57.507]  They've been trying to rehabilitate for Michelle Williams' reputation over the years.
[03:03:58.508 --> 03:04:04.655]  Well, that's the big tell-tale sign that all these socialists and commie groups are trying to get stuff going nationwide over this.
[03:04:04.675 --> 03:04:07.038]  Because they're trying to prop up socialism.
[03:04:07.058 --> 03:04:07.959]  You know, it hadn't worked.
[03:04:08.379 --> 03:04:12.985]  So they want to make it now just racially based, so folks still support their failed ideas.
[03:04:13.405 --> 03:04:15.568]  I mean, it is really a cold-blooded thing they're doing.
[03:04:16.889 --> 03:04:30.199]  Indeed, and several, at least five of the different radio personalities, I called for the con and I asked them to condemn Michelle Williams inciting a riot, which is the type of behavior that only an informant, a taxpayer-funded informant, could get away with.
[03:04:30.279 --> 03:04:30.700]  Exactly.
[03:04:30.740 --> 03:04:32.861]  If you or I did that, we'd be arrested and rightfully so.
[03:04:33.021 --> 03:04:36.184]  Why are these people allowed to criminally provocateur?
[03:04:37.611 --> 03:04:55.280]  Well because obviously the answer is a friend of mine took the approach of directly asking them that are you have you or have you ever worked for the FBI and my friend Frank did that and since then she was actually burned as will happen of course to the informants who do not come clean with her secret identities.
[03:04:55.720 --> 03:05:02.112]  She's serving 15 years of probation for attempting to sell a house that did not belong to her.
[03:05:02.152 --> 03:05:03.014]  Well, that's right.
[03:05:03.615 --> 03:05:07.562]  All you informants, they will always burn you in the end if you're involved in dirty stuff.
[03:05:07.582 --> 03:05:08.184]  We'll be back.
[03:05:10.339 --> 03:05:11.360]  You pick up the receiver.
[03:05:11.580 --> 03:05:18.445]  With your heart racing and sweat dripping from your forehead, you finally muster the courage to dial the number to call into your favorite talk radio show.
[03:05:18.505 --> 03:05:21.688]  It rings once, twice, and then... Hello, it's GCN.
[03:05:21.848 --> 03:05:23.469]  What's your name and the state you're calling from?
[03:05:23.509 --> 03:05:26.872]  Surprised you got through, you squeak out... Jason from Minnesota?
[03:05:26.952 --> 03:05:27.452]  Please hold.
[03:05:27.572 --> 03:05:34.478]  As you patiently wait for your turn, you begin to daydream about being a famous talk radio host and what it would be like to have your own show.
[03:05:34.858 --> 03:05:36.539]  Jason from Minnesota, you're up!
[03:05:36.619 --> 03:05:40.441]  Millions of loyal listeners worldwide, waiting to call and talk to you.
[03:05:40.461 --> 03:05:41.521]  What color are you there?
[03:05:41.661 --> 03:05:44.263]  Cheering crowds surround you, calling out your name.
[03:05:44.383 --> 03:05:44.863]  Jason!
[03:05:44.923 --> 03:05:46.084]  Jason!
[03:05:46.164 --> 03:05:46.464]  Jason!
[03:05:46.844 --> 03:05:47.704]  Going once.
[03:05:48.005 --> 03:05:48.505]  Twice.
[03:05:48.785 --> 03:05:50.506]  Okay, we gotta move on to the next caller.
[03:05:50.806 --> 03:05:51.386]  You blew it.
[03:05:51.426 --> 03:05:51.626]  Huh?

[03:06:09.802 --> 03:06:14.765]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[03:06:15.025 --> 03:06:21.148]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[03:06:21.328 --> 03:06:28.292]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[03:06:28.632 --> 03:06:38.477]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.

[03:06:45.240 --> 03:06:47.921]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[03:06:48.321 --> 03:06:49.821]  And adenosylcobalamin.
[03:06:50.062 --> 03:06:53.403]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[03:06:53.663 --> 03:06:55.284]  No needles, no injections.
[03:06:55.544 --> 03:06:57.024]  Don't take my word for it.
[03:06:57.184 --> 03:06:58.265]  Try it for yourself.

[03:08:11.174 --> 03:08:13.375]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:13.935 --> 03:08:16.656]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:22.728 --> 03:08:40.840]  Hashtag Rick Ross one of the top rappers in the world reaches tens of millions of people every week Pushing fake gang mindless culture the real Rick Ross That the fake Rick Ross stole his identity has called him out and challenged him so
[03:08:42.737 --> 03:08:52.842]  At hashtag Rick Ross from Real Alex Jones, retweet our tweet, but also attach to the hashtag Rick Ross we've been hijacking the last two weeks as a test.
[03:08:52.962 --> 03:08:54.243]  Remember we had Google bombs?
[03:08:54.543 --> 03:08:56.424]  So they changed the algorithm to block us.
[03:08:56.724 --> 03:08:58.966]  We could have the number one search every day if we wanted it.
[03:08:59.526 --> 03:09:00.486]  We had that for a couple years.
[03:09:00.526 --> 03:09:02.067]  I should have used it more wisely.
[03:09:03.388 --> 03:09:06.349]  Well, we are now taking over the hashtag Rick Ross.
[03:09:06.369 --> 03:09:08.931]  In fact, we already took over Colgate's for a while.
[03:09:09.946 --> 03:09:10.848]  And reach tens of millions?
[03:09:10.868 --> 03:09:12.070]  I'm not kidding here.
[03:09:12.131 --> 03:09:12.471]  Millions.
[03:09:12.892 --> 03:09:15.457]  We are now going to hijack hashtag Rick Ross.
[03:09:15.478 --> 03:09:20.468]  So tweet with hashtag Rick Ross the video that said real Alex Jones.
[03:09:21.593 --> 03:09:24.854]  It is key to get this out to everybody.
[03:09:25.755 --> 03:09:36.199]  It is absolutely essential that folks send that video out to their friends and to their family.
[03:09:36.679 --> 03:09:39.420]  Now, we're going to have overdrive for the rest of the hour taking phone calls.
[03:09:39.480 --> 03:09:40.541]  I'm leaving at the next segment.
[03:09:41.301 --> 03:09:48.643]  David Knight's going to be in here to take your calls, call after call, so you get a chance to get the word out to folks.
[03:09:49.583 --> 03:09:54.504]  Again, the video is The Real Rick Ross Challenge, and it's hashtag Rick Ross.
[03:09:54.524 --> 03:09:57.705]  The name of the video is The Real Rick Ross Challenge.
[03:09:58.485 --> 03:09:59.565]  Hashtag Rick Ross.
[03:09:59.945 --> 03:10:02.226]  I know most of our audience isn't into the Twitter thing.
[03:10:02.586 --> 03:10:03.566]  We're trying to reach
[03:10:04.466 --> 03:10:11.251]  The young people, the folks that are under this mind control, under this bondage, and we're successful doing it through these systems.
[03:10:12.733 --> 03:10:16.996]  Let's go ahead now and go to Boris in Arizona, here on the air.
[03:10:17.056 --> 03:10:17.416]  Welcome.
[03:10:18.877 --> 03:10:20.739]  Privyet, Comrade Alexander.
[03:10:21.419 --> 03:10:24.502]  The very essence of Ferguson is a giant paradox.
[03:10:25.082 --> 03:10:32.128]  You have peaceful protesters being harassed and bugged, while looters and armed thugs are free to do what they want at their own absurd will.
[03:10:33.182 --> 03:10:36.865]  Incidentally, you have Eric Holder and other demons provoking Ferguson.
[03:10:37.426 --> 03:10:41.129]  This is all very, very reminiscent of the Western-backed Kevriots.
[03:10:41.269 --> 03:10:47.975]  Tie this in with DUI checkpoints, free speech zones, pat-downs at the airport, Border Patrol internal checkpoints.
[03:10:49.316 --> 03:10:51.618]  I guess the question is, will the inevitable take place?
[03:10:51.898 --> 03:10:52.719]  But don't you worry.
[03:10:52.999 --> 03:10:55.821]  Don't you worry, Alex, because the answer to the stars will be right back.
[03:10:57.143 --> 03:11:00.946]  I can't even decipher the malarkey anymore, but I guess truth is stranger than the fixin'.
[03:11:02.381 --> 03:11:03.862]  Man, we've had the best callers today.
[03:11:04.022 --> 03:11:06.383]  All of you guys and gals are like poets or something.
[03:11:06.923 --> 03:11:08.744]  We've almost exclusively had men calling today.
[03:11:08.764 --> 03:11:09.945]  Maybe we should have some women calling.
[03:11:09.965 --> 03:11:15.228]  Some days it's all women, some days all men, some days a mix.
[03:11:15.248 --> 03:11:15.568]  800-259-9231.
[03:11:16.028 --> 03:11:17.869]  Undoubtedly, this is a shy-op.
[03:11:18.049 --> 03:11:20.831]  Undoubtedly, there is a lot of manipulation.
[03:11:22.071 --> 03:11:28.872]  I think because government, even if something organically happens, artificially tries to spin things in their direction.
[03:11:29.152 --> 03:11:30.073]  What is that direction?
[03:11:30.133 --> 03:11:31.113]  More militarization?
[03:11:31.513 --> 03:11:32.653]  More federalization?
[03:11:33.053 --> 03:11:33.813]  More division?
[03:11:33.873 --> 03:11:34.894]  More balkanization?
[03:11:35.194 --> 03:11:36.494]  What else do you think is going on here?
[03:11:36.774 --> 03:11:38.474]  A smokescreen from all the amnesty?
[03:11:38.794 --> 03:11:40.295]  A smokescreen from Obamacare?
[03:11:41.015 --> 03:11:47.496]  And it gets Obama supporters back only thinking race, instead of about how we're all being collectively screwed over.
[03:11:48.601 --> 03:11:51.064]  Yeah, you make a very good cognizant point.
[03:11:51.124 --> 03:11:52.605]  Balkanization at its finest.
[03:11:53.486 --> 03:11:56.609]  I guess you've asked a couple times what you think the endgame is.
[03:11:57.530 --> 03:12:08.201]  In my subjective viewpoint, I see the further, furtherization of the police state, new litigation to strip more civil liberties under the false pretense of safety.
[03:12:08.301 --> 03:12:11.144]  And I pray to God that, you know, it plays out to the contrary.
[03:12:11.957 --> 03:12:17.238]  Evidently, that's the way it looks like it's going, so I guess time will tell.
[03:12:17.838 --> 03:12:18.658]  God bless you, sir.
[03:12:18.738 --> 03:12:19.298]  Great points.
[03:12:19.338 --> 03:12:20.098]  Good to hear from you.
[03:12:20.219 --> 03:12:21.859]  One more article before I go back to calls.
[03:12:22.339 --> 03:12:26.040]  School expels 8-year-old whose mother refused to give her vaccine.
[03:12:27.100 --> 03:12:28.760]  Family doctor deemed unsafe.
[03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:31.301]  This is in Long Island now.
[03:12:32.041 --> 03:12:39.082]  So schools and hospitals, even when there's no law to take it, will now expel you and not give you the waiver form.
[03:12:39.960 --> 03:12:43.623]  This is because their whole vaccine system is collapsing.
[03:12:43.663 --> 03:12:44.304]  People know.
[03:12:44.564 --> 03:12:45.605]  There's a video report.
[03:12:45.625 --> 03:12:47.567]  I want to get this girl's family on, guys.
[03:12:47.927 --> 03:12:48.527]  Please try to get her.
[03:12:48.968 --> 03:13:02.720]  A showdown over vaccinations has erupted in a Long Island town after the mother of an eight-year-old was told by her doctor that a new school district rule requires children to get a booster shot at too young an age.
[03:13:04.969 --> 03:13:07.291]  See, doctors now are kind of creeping away from vaccines.
[03:13:07.311 --> 03:13:08.712]  They realize the evidence is overwhelming.
[03:13:08.732 --> 03:13:21.583]  So it's like, oh, don't don't take too many or back off or go slower because they've doubled and then tripled the amount of vaccines that people used to take in the 50s and 60s.
[03:13:22.064 --> 03:13:23.365]  So the problems are overwhelming.
[03:13:23.725 --> 03:13:25.346]  So the school said, we have a rule.
[03:13:26.252 --> 03:13:30.419]  Like, you can't play with a Nerf gun in your own backyard if your neighbor sees we're going to expel you.
[03:13:31.001 --> 03:13:34.427]  Well, you don't have any say over what you do at your house and a Nerf gun.
[03:13:35.088 --> 03:13:36.831]  See, it's all social engineering.
[03:13:39.562 --> 03:13:42.164]  And obviously, they're not even telling him that there's a waiver.
[03:13:42.444 --> 03:13:48.008]  I guarantee you, they're telling him it's the law and not telling him there's a waiver.
[03:13:48.368 --> 03:13:49.149]  It's not even a law.
[03:13:49.609 --> 03:13:58.836]  It's state health department policy, through the Department of Health at the federal level, down to the state, to the county, that it's policy rule that you take this.
[03:13:58.876 --> 03:14:01.918]  See, when Rick Perry said, it's the law, you gotta take Gardasil?
[03:14:04.660 --> 03:14:06.241]  And I said, no, it's not the law.
[03:14:08.027 --> 03:14:13.372]  He put it on the list of recommended vaccines under school policy in the state of Texas.
[03:14:14.132 --> 03:14:16.034]  And it took people months to believe me.
[03:14:16.434 --> 03:14:17.435]  We were the spearhead of that.
[03:14:17.455 --> 03:14:18.616]  I'm proud of the fact we exposed it.
[03:14:19.096 --> 03:14:21.278]  Going, I'm telling you, here's the law, here's the waivers.
[03:14:21.979 --> 03:14:23.560]  The law says you don't have to have a waiver.
[03:14:23.620 --> 03:14:26.963]  It's just that the school wants it for the health department.
[03:14:27.683 --> 03:14:28.344]  Blah, blah, blah.
[03:14:30.446 --> 03:14:31.907]  People are like, no, the governor wouldn't lie.
[03:14:31.967 --> 03:14:32.768]  It's the law.
[03:14:35.140 --> 03:14:40.843]  See, by having a governor do that, it had such authority, people went, man, Alex, you gotta be, he wouldn't dare lie.
[03:14:41.504 --> 03:14:47.207]  See, but the bigger the lie, the harder it is to bring it down, but when you do, the harder it falls.
[03:14:47.507 --> 03:14:49.928]  And then it crushes a bunch of other lies around it.
[03:14:50.448 --> 03:14:54.230]  Like a meteor out of space, crushing when it hits, leaving a crater.
[03:14:56.532 --> 03:14:59.093]  When you talk to libertarians and conservatives, why do you not like Rick Perry?
[03:14:59.293 --> 03:15:00.374]  Because of his vaccine stuff.
[03:15:02.079 --> 03:15:05.201]  And Rick Perry has come out and said, I apologize, I should have handled that better.
[03:15:05.721 --> 03:15:07.482]  That's not perfect, but at least it's something.
[03:15:08.442 --> 03:15:10.063]  What about all the dead girls, Perry?
[03:15:12.785 --> 03:15:13.645]  Clear your conscience.
[03:15:14.085 --> 03:15:15.486]  Come out and speak out more.
[03:15:15.686 --> 03:15:16.686]  I know you listen to the show.
[03:15:17.327 --> 03:15:18.047]  Say it's wrong.
[03:15:18.147 --> 03:15:18.708]  Warn people.
[03:15:18.948 --> 03:15:20.188]  Don't have this on your conscience.
[03:15:21.549 --> 03:15:22.670]  Rick, in Pennsylvania.
[03:15:22.690 --> 03:15:23.290]  Thanks for holding.
[03:15:25.011 --> 03:15:25.931]  Hello Alex, how are you?
[03:15:26.091 --> 03:15:26.552]  Good, brother.
[03:15:26.572 --> 03:15:27.152]  Thanks for calling.
[03:15:28.260 --> 03:15:32.004]  A loyal listener for years, and I loved your show.
[03:15:32.044 --> 03:15:36.829]  I want to say that I did watch your interview a few weeks ago with the real Rick Ross.
[03:15:36.909 --> 03:15:42.115]  I thought that was one of the most powerful interviews that I've seen in a long time.
[03:15:42.295 --> 03:15:42.835]  Well, thank you, Brian.
[03:15:42.875 --> 03:15:43.256]  I loved it.
[03:15:43.956 --> 03:15:44.537]  It was excellent.
[03:15:45.177 --> 03:15:55.746]  With Ferguson, I do want to say that, you know, when Obama came on yesterday and asked for quiet and peace and peaceful protests, you know, who was he speaking to?
[03:15:55.826 --> 03:16:01.330]  Because, you know, everyone that was there to protest a riot was already out on the streets.
[03:16:01.750 --> 03:16:05.233]  They weren't listening to Obama making his speech.
[03:16:05.313 --> 03:16:06.134]  They could have cared less.
[03:16:06.374 --> 03:16:14.896]  It was only meant to make him look like he's a peacemaker when he's got the Justice Department in there and MSNBC winding everybody racially up.
[03:16:15.997 --> 03:16:16.937]  Absolutely, I agree.
[03:16:17.037 --> 03:16:25.559]  And, you know, I was watching at 2 o'clock in the morning when they announced, when the chief came on and said, you know, we didn't have enough people or resources.
[03:16:26.240 --> 03:16:30.621]  And he said, I think he said something like, we need 10,000 people to take care of this.
[03:16:31.388 --> 03:16:43.977]  Bull, if they had police every half block or whatever, in body armor, keeping their heads down on rooftops, you know, have a squad car around the corner, have people on rooftops, you see somebody with a gun, you just shoot them.
[03:16:44.617 --> 03:16:50.021]  I mean, you put guys on the roofs with sniper rifles, and you see somebody out there shooting the guns at people, you kill them!
[03:16:51.062 --> 03:16:55.525]  And you can have a video camera on the gun, videotape it, there's no debating it, you release it.
[03:16:55.885 --> 03:16:56.926]  Why didn't they
[03:16:58.291 --> 03:17:05.674]  Just go ahead and let, you know, the cop get charged, just like the Zimmerman deal, show that it would come out.
[03:17:06.454 --> 03:17:07.895]  Show that it would show all the evidence.
[03:17:07.995 --> 03:17:11.316]  Why did they sit on it from the beginning when they knew they had all these witnesses?
[03:17:12.016 --> 03:17:15.057]  See, I'm telling you, man, this whole thing stinks to high heaven.
[03:17:15.517 --> 03:17:16.318]  Anything else, Rick?
[03:17:17.518 --> 03:17:24.421]  I just believe that this has all been staged and, you know, anyone that believes that this is anything more than a
[03:17:25.618 --> 03:17:43.727]  Show of the federal government taking over our rights and policing us to a point where we no longer can even believe in anything that they have to say or do is, you know, you deserve it if you believe this stuff, because this is absolutely insane.
[03:17:43.867 --> 03:17:46.188]  I've never seen anything like this before in my life.
[03:17:47.819 --> 03:17:50.582]  Alright, God bless you, great job, we appreciate your call.
[03:17:50.922 --> 03:17:53.444]  I just say that, great job to the callers, because they are just great callers.
[03:17:54.045 --> 03:17:56.107]  Let's talk to Beth in Arizona, you're on the air.
[03:17:57.523 --> 03:18:05.467]  Hi Alex, I was looking at the pictures from the protests going on and there was a picture in D.C.
[03:18:06.027 --> 03:18:11.010]  and I always have a habit of looking at the bottom of the protester's sign to see who their sponsor is.
[03:18:11.650 --> 03:18:17.333]  Well this one group in D.C., the sponsor was AnswerCoalition.org.
[03:18:17.933 --> 03:18:23.216]  So I pull it up and at the bottom of the page it says find a demonstration here.
[03:18:24.193 --> 03:18:35.798]  And it also says, be sure to circulate this important appeal by veterans to members of the Missouri National Guard calling on them to stand with Ferguson protesters, not the police.
[03:18:36.879 --> 03:18:44.022]  So when you click on the link to find a protest, it takes you to another page called MarchForward.org.
[03:18:45.003 --> 03:18:52.146]  This is veterans, if you scan down the page, it's all veterans that are either currently serving or have served.
[03:18:52.933 --> 03:18:59.557]  In all branches of military that seem to be anti-imperialist, anti-government.
[03:18:59.597 --> 03:19:05.620]  Yeah, how do you think the Weathermen ended up recruiting Grathwald because he was a Green Beret?
[03:19:05.900 --> 03:19:07.381]  That's who they always want to get.
[03:19:08.274 --> 03:19:15.242]  And if you look at these groups, the signs are communist and socialist groups that are trying to get this going.
[03:19:15.303 --> 03:19:23.052]  I mean this, I'm telling you, Obama is trying to test and see if he can use this, like Trayvon Martin, to try to get a clash going.
[03:19:23.072 --> 03:19:26.235]  And it's just, it's unbelievable.
[03:19:26.496 --> 03:19:27.237]  It's unbelievable.
[03:19:27.777 --> 03:19:31.200]  I don't know whether they want to have a communist takeover or whether they want to have a fascist takeover.
[03:19:31.660 --> 03:19:36.423]  You know, they may have the problem and then use the police, or they may actually overthrow the system.
[03:19:36.744 --> 03:19:37.644]  I mean, who knows?
[03:19:37.744 --> 03:19:39.706]  It's just Katie bar the door.
[03:19:39.866 --> 03:19:44.970]  Everybody should be digging into who's behind trying to get this stuff, you know, these so-called protests going.
[03:19:46.787 --> 03:19:49.490]  Send us your tips at ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[03:19:50.111 --> 03:19:51.472]  But yes, really interesting points.

[03:19:54.776 --> 03:19:57.158]  We just looked up one group, and it's basically a communist group.
[03:19:57.178 --> 03:19:59.280]  You go to their website, they got red flags.
[03:19:59.741 --> 03:20:01.903]  That's who got them to go march on the White House last night.
[03:20:01.923 --> 03:20:04.906]  And again, it's their First Amendment right.
[03:20:05.107 --> 03:20:07.249]  They're just hijacking this to use it.
[03:20:09.571 --> 03:20:10.812]  I love a dark house.
[03:20:11.192 --> 03:20:13.614]  Inside is all the stuff you work so hard for.
[03:20:13.634 --> 03:20:15.656]  And I'm gonna rob you blind.
[03:20:15.996 --> 03:20:18.018]  Don't be the next victim of a break-in.

[03:22:08.248 --> 03:22:14.470]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[03:22:14.930 --> 03:22:22.692]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[03:22:23.033 --> 03:22:30.875]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[03:22:31.215 --> 03:22:35.957]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:22:36.298 --> 03:22:41.020]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.

[03:24:05.807 --> 03:24:06.448]  I'll see you there!
[03:24:19.109 --> 03:24:22.853]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on Overdrive.
[03:24:22.913 --> 03:24:23.473]  I'm David Knight.
[03:24:23.493 --> 03:24:24.715]  I'm going to be taking your calls.
[03:24:24.755 --> 03:24:28.358]  We wanted to get your response, so I'm going to continue this through the rest of the hour.
[03:24:29.399 --> 03:24:37.848]  Before I do, I just want to say that what we should be having right now is a national conversation on excessive police violence.
[03:24:38.442 --> 03:24:47.851]  We've been covering this over and over and over again, and yet they've deliberately manipulated this into a conversation that is strictly going to be about racism.
[03:24:48.891 --> 03:24:50.032]  That's what's happening right now.
[03:24:50.592 --> 03:25:08.781]  When you look at what they did last night, remember that when these riots initially happened in the aftermath of the shooting, and I think the thing that viscerally set everybody off about this was leaving the body in the street for so long unattended, making it look as though they had absolute contempt for Michael Brown.
[03:25:09.901 --> 03:25:22.064]  But remember that when they were having these protests, these demonstrations, violence, when our reporters were there the first time, they told everybody, protest all you want, but don't be here after dark.
[03:25:23.308 --> 03:25:29.471]  They knew that was when the riots were always taking place at precisely the time they released this.
[03:25:29.791 --> 03:25:32.633]  This was calculated to incite violence.
[03:25:33.313 --> 03:25:36.995]  We had an indictment decision early in the day.
[03:25:37.456 --> 03:25:38.696]  We had it at 1 o'clock.
[03:25:38.716 --> 03:25:44.239]  They had told the schools in the past when they first started this long, drawn-out grand jury procedure.
[03:25:44.259 --> 03:25:45.120]  They had told the schools.
[03:25:45.740 --> 03:25:49.422]  We will notify you if it's a weekday within three hours of the grand jury.
[03:25:49.442 --> 03:25:52.503]  We'll give you three hours notification so you can make preparations at the schools.
[03:25:52.543 --> 03:25:54.784]  Of course, they canceled the schools this week.
[03:25:55.885 --> 03:26:00.947]  Nevertheless, they waited seven or more hours before they released this.
[03:26:01.067 --> 03:26:02.568]  Waited until 8 p.m.
[03:26:02.848 --> 03:26:06.470]  when it was as early as possible, yet totally dark.
[03:26:07.070 --> 03:26:08.111]  That's what they wanted to do.
[03:26:08.151 --> 03:26:09.051]  They engineered this.
[03:26:09.311 --> 03:26:11.132]  Let's go to your comments, Jason in Texas.
[03:26:11.152 --> 03:26:11.612]  You're up next.
[03:26:11.672 --> 03:26:11.993]  Go ahead.
[03:26:13.533 --> 03:26:14.774]  Hey David, thanks for taking my call.
[03:26:15.453 --> 03:26:15.893]  Sure, go ahead.
[03:26:15.933 --> 03:26:16.433]  What's on your mind?
[03:26:16.653 --> 03:26:17.554]  I had a quick question.
[03:26:18.074 --> 03:26:19.334]  Not really a question, but a comment.
[03:26:21.335 --> 03:26:29.637]  I read in the, I think it was the Free Beacon a couple days ago, that Obama had called for some sort of civil air patrol to buzz the White House.
[03:26:29.697 --> 03:26:31.958]  I think it was between the hours of 12 and 2.
[03:26:34.038 --> 03:26:42.781]  My thought is, was he doing this because of his lack of, he didn't really believe in his
[03:26:44.091 --> 03:26:44.511]  I think so.
[03:26:59.302 --> 03:26:59.882]  Well, I don't know.
[03:26:59.942 --> 03:27:07.685]  I haven't seen that report, and quite frankly, I don't think Obama is worried about this not working, you know, about taking some heat for this.
[03:27:08.245 --> 03:27:09.406]  He wants this.
[03:27:09.766 --> 03:27:14.348]  I think they stretched this thing out for an incredibly, incredibly long period of time.
[03:27:14.408 --> 03:27:21.090]  This prosecutor, who is a Democrat, I think stretched this thing out because they have been trying to play the race card for this election all along.
[03:27:21.450 --> 03:27:22.631]  They knew they were going to take a beating.
[03:27:23.211 --> 03:27:25.192]  Nobody was happy with Obama's policies.
[03:27:25.533 --> 03:27:36.720]  The only thing they had going was exactly what Landrieu, who was running for re-election, the female senator in Louisiana, said, they don't like women, and they don't like blacks.
[03:27:36.740 --> 03:27:38.802]  That's why they're angry at me and Obama.
[03:27:39.522 --> 03:27:41.044]  We elected Obama twice.
[03:27:41.564 --> 03:27:42.745]  She got elected three times.
[03:27:43.046 --> 03:27:45.949]  They're trying to make it about sexism, about racism.
[03:27:46.329 --> 03:27:48.151]  That's the only thing they can fall back on.
[03:27:48.171 --> 03:27:53.677]  So I think this falls perfectly within the plans of things that he would like to see happen, quite frankly.
[03:27:54.117 --> 03:27:55.198]  They have engineered this.
[03:27:55.258 --> 03:27:57.701]  They want the police to believe that this is a war zone.
[03:27:58.181 --> 03:28:03.943]  More importantly, they want the public to believe that we need to fully militarize our police.
[03:28:03.983 --> 03:28:05.403]  This is what they're selling everybody.
[03:28:05.803 --> 03:28:12.465]  This is the rules of engagement, that they live in a war zone, that they need to shoot first and keep shooting until their gun is empty.
[03:28:12.525 --> 03:28:16.306]  That's what they've been training the police in the last few years.
[03:28:16.346 --> 03:28:19.207]  They have radically changed the rules of engagement for the police.
[03:28:19.747 --> 03:28:23.728]  It is coming from Washington and it is a militarization of the police.
[03:28:23.768 --> 03:28:25.929]  Did you have anything else you wanted to comment on?
[03:28:26.758 --> 03:28:26.998]  I did.
[03:28:27.058 --> 03:28:28.720]  I was just going to say, make a comment.
[03:28:28.780 --> 03:28:41.293]  Do you think the, by the military standing down at Ferguson and letting, you know, the looters and the people that are, you know, shooting the guns off, are they trying to make a strong case for December 24th with the U.N.
[03:28:41.313 --> 03:28:45.177]  Small Trade Treaty, you know, trying to persuade
[03:28:49.398 --> 03:28:50.259]  Certainly with everything.
[03:28:51.219 --> 03:28:56.961]  As one of the callers earlier pointed out, who was a long time fireman, this is kind of a rope-a-dope.
[03:28:57.241 --> 03:28:58.901]  Let's stand back.
[03:28:58.981 --> 03:29:00.202]  Let's let them riot.
[03:29:00.262 --> 03:29:05.664]  We're not going to get in their way if they want to burn down a building, if they want to loot a building.
[03:29:06.104 --> 03:29:07.824]  We'll kind of let this roll for one night.
[03:29:08.004 --> 03:29:09.145]  Everybody take your pictures.
[03:29:09.185 --> 03:29:10.585]  We'll let that percolate in the media.
[03:29:10.645 --> 03:29:12.626]  And then today they come down with an iron fist.
[03:29:13.166 --> 03:29:14.367]  That's probably what we'll see happen.
[03:29:14.707 --> 03:29:17.309]  It's the same strategy they're doing with Ebola, if you look at it.
[03:29:17.769 --> 03:29:20.451]  They want Ebola to be brought into this country.
[03:29:20.871 --> 03:29:30.197]  They don't want to have any quarantine, but boy, they've got the rules and regulations to hammer us with a medical tyranny once this thing gets out of hand.
[03:29:30.297 --> 03:29:31.538]  They want disorder.
[03:29:31.578 --> 03:29:32.539]  They want chaos.
[03:29:32.579 --> 03:29:33.419]  They want crisis.
[03:29:33.459 --> 03:29:34.960]  That's the way they grow their government.
[03:29:35.280 --> 03:29:35.781]  Thanks, Jason.
[03:29:35.821 --> 03:29:36.882]  Let's go to John in Kentucky.
[03:29:36.902 --> 03:29:37.102]  John?
[03:29:38.041 --> 03:29:39.642]  Oh wait, we're going up to a commercial break.
[03:29:39.982 --> 03:29:44.484]  We're gonna be right back with John in Kentucky, Jeremy in Michigan, and several more that are on the line.
[03:29:44.804 --> 03:29:46.305]  Hang on, we'll be right back with your calls.
[03:29:58.410 --> 03:29:59.310]  We're on the march.
[03:29:59.811 --> 03:30:01.411]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:30:02.332 --> 03:30:05.033]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:09.881 --> 03:30:12.163]  What good is a Big Berkey water filter?
[03:30:12.763 --> 03:30:16.025]  We get that question a lot here at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[03:30:16.305 --> 03:30:18.107]  And in a word, the answer is protection.
[03:30:18.467 --> 03:30:27.493]  Protection from water main breaks, E. coli contamination, environmental chemical spills, pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell, and all forms of fluoride.
[03:30:27.773 --> 03:30:33.417]  Plus, Big Berkey water filters are the original gravity water filter system and most trusted on the market for a reason.

[03:31:09.508 --> 03:31:15.754]  When I first got online and I seen the price of the X2 and the DNA Force, I was a little hesitant, but I pulled the trigger on it.
[03:31:15.834 --> 03:31:16.855]  It has changed my life.
[03:31:16.875 --> 03:31:18.957]  I've been taking it for about 24 days now.
[03:31:19.057 --> 03:31:20.419]  Counting the weights, gaining shape.

[03:31:23.101 --> 03:31:24.543]  You've heard the callers to the show.
[03:31:24.583 --> 03:31:28.466]  Several months back, I started taking your nascent iodine and your super meal.
[03:31:28.526 --> 03:31:30.408]  Prior to this, I was barely walking.
[03:31:30.508 --> 03:31:33.151]  Now, I'm able to function as a human again.
[03:31:33.251 --> 03:31:50.727]  Whether it's Survival Shield Nascent Iodine or DNA Force, Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality, Lung Cleanse, Fluoride Shields, Oxy Powder, I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com.

[03:32:12.592 --> 03:32:15.735]  At no time in history have precious metals been more important.
[03:32:15.935 --> 03:32:18.418]  Certainly not in my 22 years in the industry.
[03:32:18.678 --> 03:32:22.341]  The dollar has lost over 90% of its value in the last 60 years.
[03:32:22.622 --> 03:32:26.105]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.
[03:32:26.385 --> 03:32:27.466]  Ours is not immune.
[03:32:27.787 --> 03:32:29.428]  The time is now to be proactive.

[03:32:43.039 --> 03:32:46.221]  Do you want to leave a legacy of wealth or debt for your family?

[03:32:49.943 --> 03:32:50.924]  Be proactive, not reactive.
[03:32:50.944 --> 03:32:51.124]  Call 1-800-686-2237
[03:33:04.995 --> 03:33:05.517]  Extension 116.
[03:33:28.126 --> 03:33:29.386]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:29.466 --> 03:33:30.067]  I'm David Knight.
[03:33:30.087 --> 03:33:31.187]  Here we're in Overdrive.
[03:33:31.207 --> 03:33:32.067]  We're taking your calls.
[03:33:32.087 --> 03:33:35.348]  We want to get your reactions to what's going on in Ferguson.
[03:33:35.428 --> 03:33:42.031]  It's a huge watershed event because there are some real systemic problems here.
[03:33:42.071 --> 03:33:45.092]  And of course, racism is an element here.
[03:33:45.112 --> 03:33:53.174]  It definitely is falling disproportionately on black people, but just like the war on drugs, it also falls disproportionately on black people.
[03:33:53.254 --> 03:33:54.255]  It affects all of us.
[03:33:54.955 --> 03:33:57.018]  It destroys our justice system.
[03:33:57.859 --> 03:34:04.187]  Any of us can be shot dead by the police and they can essentially get away with it with these different rules of engagement.
[03:34:04.227 --> 03:34:07.231]  We need to have outside oversight.
[03:34:07.732 --> 03:34:11.877]  What you just saw with this grand jury process, this secretive process, was not a real trial.
[03:34:12.538 --> 03:34:15.360]  There was not a jury, there was not openness, there was not transparency.
[03:34:15.700 --> 03:34:20.063]  Usually it is a pro forma process, it goes through, doesn't take very long.
[03:34:20.343 --> 03:34:27.248]  They stretch this, something that usually takes less than a day, they stretched into three months, or more than three months.
[03:34:28.388 --> 03:34:34.132]  This is something that is very unusual, it's very unusual for the defendant to testify at all before a grand jury.
[03:34:34.172 --> 03:34:34.412]  Why?
[03:34:34.812 --> 03:34:37.494]  Because there's no, he cannot have his lawyer.
[03:34:37.554 --> 03:34:39.876]  There's nobody there but the prosecutor.
[03:34:41.018 --> 03:34:43.421]  And so, Darren Wilson, the defendant, testified.
[03:34:43.521 --> 03:34:45.804]  He gave over four hours of testimony.
[03:34:46.204 --> 03:34:47.506]  Very unusual situation.
[03:34:47.566 --> 03:34:50.650]  It almost makes it look like the prosecutor doesn't want to prosecute, doesn't it?
[03:34:51.820 --> 03:34:59.686]  We need to have this conversation, yet this, because the way this is handled, I believe they have deliberately manipulated this in order to feed racism.
[03:35:00.346 --> 03:35:13.195]  We have seen many other cases, and we haven't seen the kind of turnout in blatant, clear-cut situations where the man was killed, had absolutely no guilt.
[03:35:13.495 --> 03:35:15.657]  We had that in the Walmart situation.
[03:35:15.837 --> 03:35:16.437]  We're good to go.
[03:35:37.205 --> 03:35:41.747]  Yet there is nothing done to the guy who made the false call either.
[03:35:42.227 --> 03:35:50.891]  We have the video footage showing that he didn't threaten anybody, showing that he was shot before he was given an opportunity to set the toy gun down.
[03:35:51.912 --> 03:35:53.234]  Yet, nothing has been done.
[03:35:53.434 --> 03:35:57.419]  Not even the person who essentially yelled fire in a crowded theater.
[03:35:57.459 --> 03:35:59.162]  The guy who made the 911 call.
[03:35:59.202 --> 03:36:00.964]  No charges have been brought against him either.
[03:36:01.605 --> 03:36:04.068]  There are serious problems with this system.
[03:36:04.569 --> 03:36:07.252]  And it goes far beyond one group or another.
[03:36:07.853 --> 03:36:13.136]  We go back to the famous quote from Pastor Martin Niemöller, from the Nazi regime.
[03:36:13.176 --> 03:36:15.357]  He said, they came against this group, I didn't do anything.
[03:36:15.377 --> 03:36:18.378]  They came against that group, I didn't do anything, because I wasn't a member of those groups.
[03:36:18.398 --> 03:36:20.339]  And then they came against me and there was nobody left.
[03:36:20.880 --> 03:36:23.181]  That is precisely the situation we see here.
[03:36:23.321 --> 03:36:27.243]  If we're going to fall back into this group against that group, it's not about that.
[03:36:27.563 --> 03:36:30.045]  It's not even about everybody versus the police.
[03:36:30.666 --> 03:36:32.687]  They're going to fall prey to this as well.
[03:36:33.168 --> 03:36:45.578]  Now, I want to go back to your calls, but before we do, I want to let you know this hour is brought to you by the Alex Jones, by the Infowarslife.com, and we have about a week left of Silver Bullet at the rate that it's going.
[03:36:45.598 --> 03:36:47.540]  We're going to run out probably of Secret 12 today.
[03:36:48.761 --> 03:36:51.322]  And it takes a long time to get these things back in.
[03:36:51.382 --> 03:36:54.984]  We get them in one batch at a time, especially silver bullet.
[03:36:55.064 --> 03:36:57.726]  It could take us at least six weeks to get that back in.
[03:36:58.226 --> 03:37:03.188]  It's very difficult and dangerous to make it in the high concentrations of 30 parts per million that we have here.
[03:37:03.689 --> 03:37:06.330]  It's in a deionized water base.
[03:37:06.490 --> 03:37:08.871]  It's free of toxic artificial additives.
[03:37:09.292 --> 03:37:15.675]  There's never been a more important time to have a powerful and clean form of colloidal silver within reach for you and your family.
[03:37:16.155 --> 03:37:21.238]  Go to m4slife.com to order your Silver Bullet now or call 888-253-3139.
[03:37:21.298 --> 03:37:24.521]  That's 888-253-139.
[03:37:25.341 --> 03:37:39.030]  With cold season upon us and various other things that you need to be protected against in this time of year, it's a great time to stock up on these things that can help you fight infection, things that can build your immune system.
[03:37:39.430 --> 03:37:45.034]  So again, Secret 12 is going to sell out today and probably at the rate things have been going, we're going to be out of Silver Bullet within a week.
[03:37:45.174 --> 03:37:45.835]  Yes David, how are you doing?
[03:38:00.170 --> 03:38:03.014]  Yeah, I was calling in about a comment on Ferguson.
[03:38:03.074 --> 03:38:09.421]  I think it really is like a testing ground of what they're going to spread across the rest of the country.
[03:38:09.822 --> 03:38:16.290]  Because like you were saying earlier, they really haven't had a bigger reaction to this type of situation like they have here.
[03:38:17.236 --> 03:38:41.026]  Yeah, it gives them a chance to use their new toys, it gives them a chance to use their new rules of engagement, it gives them a chance to try it out, and we have been a testing ground for their propaganda manipulation through the press because they have deliberately made this particular case where you've got a situation where possibly the officer was justified at some level to use force.
[03:38:41.886 --> 03:38:50.130]  Whether or not it was fully justified, I believe they should have had an indictment of probable cause from the grand jury.
[03:38:50.190 --> 03:38:54.593]  I think they should have had an open, transparent trial because here's the system.
[03:38:55.673 --> 03:39:02.057]  We have the officer's guilt or innocence is not as important as the system's guilt or innocence.
[03:39:02.757 --> 03:39:07.259]  Everyone is rightfully questioning whether or not we have a legitimate system.
[03:39:07.820 --> 03:39:17.825]  And we need to see that the system is capable of opening, of openly operating and being transparent and putting all of its cards on the table.
[03:39:18.185 --> 03:39:19.205]  We should have had a trial.
[03:39:19.245 --> 03:39:23.147]  We could have seen the exculpatory evidence brought out little by little.
[03:39:23.227 --> 03:39:25.409]  People could have discussed it as it was going along.
[03:39:25.749 --> 03:39:27.870]  They could have stood this thing down.
[03:39:27.930 --> 03:39:31.912]  Instead, they kept it secret in a grand jury operation.
[03:39:32.332 --> 03:39:33.433]  Yeah, I agree with you there.
[03:39:33.453 --> 03:39:40.059]  And I agree with Alex on the fact that they are using like, berets or Delta Force or something there because it just don't add up.
[03:40:00.265 --> 03:40:09.288]  And another thing I was wanting to tell you guys about is my, like, in my small town, Mount Sterling, Kentucky, like, it's a pretty small town.
[03:40:09.668 --> 03:40:14.510]  I mean, you know, we got Lexington and everything else around, and there ain't as many people here.
[03:40:15.050 --> 03:40:28.535]  But there's been like a lot of, uh, I think they're about to do something here, because there's been like a lot of military activity, CIA vehicles, like, numerous other amount of agencies here, and just, like,
[03:40:29.463 --> 03:40:30.684]  Weird things been going on.
[03:40:30.724 --> 03:40:34.208]  Too many, like, military vehicles and helicopters.
[03:40:34.228 --> 03:40:40.173]  Well, I can tell you that you're seeing militarization all over the country, and it is really a national problem.
[03:40:40.694 --> 03:40:43.476]  As well, as I said, the rules of engagement that we're seeing from the police.
[03:40:43.696 --> 03:40:44.317]  Thank you, John.
[03:40:44.717 --> 03:40:47.220]  Let's move on to Jeremy in Michigan.
[03:40:47.240 --> 03:40:47.540]  Jeremy.
[03:40:51.704 --> 03:40:52.184]  Go ahead, Jeremy.
[03:40:52.384 --> 03:40:52.645]  Hello?
[03:40:52.985 --> 03:40:53.846]  Yes, go ahead.
[03:40:54.366 --> 03:40:55.047]  Oh, hey, David.
[03:40:55.939 --> 03:41:03.643]  Yeah, I just wanted to applaud you for at least mentioning that some of this has something to do with race.
[03:41:04.243 --> 03:41:21.352]  Because all I've seen, and what's quite frankly appalling, is the level of insensitivity to the fact that black people have been disproportionately incarcerated, as well as Latinos, harassed and beaten by the police.
[03:41:24.224 --> 03:41:34.176]  There's not enough credit given to the organic nature of this whole protest and this whole outrage, what's really not a protest, which is really just rioting and acting crazy.
[03:41:34.617 --> 03:41:41.185]  It's because of the fury, because a lot of people don't understand what it's like to be black and discriminated against.
[03:41:42.106 --> 03:41:53.836]  And as a black man, you know, having been discriminated on plenty of times, and every other black person I've known at some point, it's a deep feeling of hurt and rage that comes with it.
[03:41:53.876 --> 03:41:57.078]  Because you just want to, you know, be respectful and get along with people.
[03:41:57.238 --> 03:42:05.806]  And no matter how respectful you are, just as we saw with the cop on the East Coast side, when the guy got out of his truck just trying to get his license, it just gunned down.
[03:42:06.727 --> 03:42:08.148]  Uh, you know, it's that kind of thing.
[03:42:08.208 --> 03:42:16.316]  No matter how respectful you are, even after getting shot, calling them, sir, you're still looked at as someone who has, it has to be something wrong with it.
[03:42:16.356 --> 03:42:27.988]  And that's quite frankly, even with Alex Jones, surprisingly enough, someone who I've seen just a year ago protesting, uh, and, and, and, and police harassing him and he, you know, he goes, here I am getting assaulted, getting assaulted.
[03:42:28.228 --> 03:42:29.129]  He knows exactly.
[03:42:30.090 --> 03:42:30.990]  Well, and that's just it.
[03:42:31.331 --> 03:42:42.300]  It's not, you know, certainly as I said before, there is a component of racism in this and you cannot deny that when you see that it is 10 times or 12 times or more.
[03:42:42.320 --> 03:42:47.565]  80% of the people who go to jail for marijuana possession actually serve time are black.
[03:42:47.585 --> 03:42:54.851]  You don't see the same kinds of conviction rates with the rest of the population that you see with blacks for marijuana, for example.
[03:42:55.251 --> 03:42:56.773]  And of course, the shootings.
[03:42:56.873 --> 03:42:58.094]  It's a much, much higher rate.
[03:42:58.134 --> 03:43:02.099]  It's so far out of proportion, you have to acknowledge that that's an element of it.
[03:43:02.880 --> 03:43:07.265]  But if they divide us along racial lines, none of us will be safe.
[03:43:07.665 --> 03:43:11.650]  That's the way that we don't get anything changed, is that they divide us from that.
[03:43:12.050 --> 03:43:15.635]  I cannot even imagine how you as a black man feels by this.
[03:43:16.155 --> 03:43:23.939]  I get a little bit of a taste of it when I see people who are here as illegal aliens essentially getting a pass when they do things in traffic.
[03:43:23.979 --> 03:43:30.382]  We've had people in my family now hit twice and these are illegal aliens and basically they don't even get a ticket.
[03:43:30.463 --> 03:43:31.783]  They just tell them to go ahead and go.
[03:43:32.263 --> 03:43:33.604]  So that infuriates me.
[03:43:33.644 --> 03:43:38.787]  That's a very minor thing compared to what's happening to the black people in this country.
[03:43:39.247 --> 03:43:44.430]  And you know, that is something where people who are not citizens of this country are getting a preferential treatment.
[03:43:44.450 --> 03:43:48.012]  We see it with the welfare that they receive coming in as illegal immigrants.
[03:43:48.352 --> 03:43:50.674]  We see it with their legal status even on the streets.
[03:43:51.354 --> 03:43:54.496]  And that is something where they get, and it's not even a racial thing.
[03:43:54.796 --> 03:43:56.097]  It's not even a Hispanic thing.
[03:43:56.537 --> 03:43:58.738]  That's a citizen versus non-citizen thing.
[03:43:58.778 --> 03:44:01.140]  If you're a white, black, Hispanic citizen,
[03:44:01.880 --> 03:44:05.322]  You're not going to get the same kind of treatment as an illegal alien does on the road.
[03:44:05.342 --> 03:44:06.523]  So that makes me angry.
[03:44:06.783 --> 03:44:17.190]  I can only imagine if there's the kind of disproportionate actions with black people in terms of shootings, in terms of incarceration for the war on drugs.
[03:44:17.690 --> 03:44:20.011]  But we can't fall into that trap.
[03:44:20.672 --> 03:44:21.973]  That's what they want us to do.
[03:44:22.013 --> 03:44:23.874]  They want to pit one group against the other.
[03:44:24.274 --> 03:44:25.815]  We need to take on this system.
[03:44:26.095 --> 03:44:28.197]  And that's why I said earlier, Jeremy, that
[03:44:29.266 --> 03:44:33.287]  What people needed to see was they needed to see that the system was honest.
[03:44:33.927 --> 03:44:35.307]  And I'm not convinced that it was.
[03:44:35.347 --> 03:44:45.629]  And I think they deliberately kept it hidden, kept it in the dark the entire process, then released the verdict in the dark, literally, to try to foment this kind of race war.
[03:44:45.749 --> 03:44:49.490]  And now we see that's all that people want to talk about is the race aspect of it.
[03:44:49.710 --> 03:44:55.671]  It was a black man who was shot in Walmart with a BB gun that he was going to buy from Walmart and a phone in his hand.
[03:44:56.571 --> 03:45:00.355]  That was something where that was a clear case he was not doing anything wrong.
[03:45:00.415 --> 03:45:02.276]  We had the videotapes from the store.
[03:45:02.677 --> 03:45:08.963]  Something needed to be done about that and ask yourself why we didn't see that many protests there in that area.
[03:45:09.003 --> 03:45:10.484]  There's a few people that are protesting it.
[03:45:11.004 --> 03:45:16.269]  One of the major protests they've had the student organization protesting that there and outside of Dayton, Ohio.
[03:45:17.150 --> 03:45:19.713]  The second group that was there was Open Carry.
[03:45:20.273 --> 03:45:36.888]  And I saw a video of that, and almost all the people in that open carry rally were white people, because they understood that if they could get shot down merely having a gun in their hands, the police feel justified because they don't get indicted shooting a man in a Walmart with a BB gun in his hand.
[03:45:37.128 --> 03:45:42.572]  They can shoot these guys who have a real gun, and it's an open carry state, they can shoot them down in the street if they feel like it.
[03:45:42.593 --> 03:45:44.714]  All they have to say is, I felt like I was threatened.
[03:45:44.935 --> 03:45:46.376]  I'd love to have your comment on that.
[03:45:47.951 --> 03:45:48.654]  Right, right.
[03:45:48.755 --> 03:45:49.960]  And you never...
[03:45:50.780 --> 03:45:59.046]  It seems like it is selective as far as which one they choose, but at the same time, it's the incident itself which causes the outrage.
[03:45:59.586 --> 03:46:00.587]  One has to be chosen.
[03:46:00.627 --> 03:46:03.048]  I mean, it doesn't matter to me which one because they're all bad.
[03:46:03.468 --> 03:46:17.197]  So, I mean, I don't feel like it's a selective process as far as what they pick and choose, or which ones to talk about and protest about, or how Sharpton gets up and makes a big deal about, because there's so many instances that it has to start somewhere.
[03:46:17.217 --> 03:46:19.359]  Well, yeah, but let's go back to the Walmart.
[03:46:19.739 --> 03:46:28.622]  Okay, you had a white officer who killed this black man in the store who was not doing anything whatsoever, and they go through and they have an indictment.
[03:46:28.682 --> 03:46:33.644]  I mean, we didn't see the national mainstream media really talking about this much.
[03:46:33.964 --> 03:46:35.205]  You didn't see Eric Holder there.
[03:46:35.485 --> 03:46:37.706]  You didn't see Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson there.
[03:46:38.066 --> 03:46:42.367]  They could have made the same case that he was shot down because he was black and it was a white officer.
[03:46:42.628 --> 03:46:43.468]  They didn't do it.
[03:46:44.048 --> 03:46:46.991]  They picked the case where there was going to be some ambiguity.
[03:46:47.052 --> 03:46:51.116]  They waited a long time to talk about the exculpatory evidence about Darren Wilson.
[03:46:51.136 --> 03:46:53.719]  They waited a long time to start dribbling that out.
[03:46:54.160 --> 03:47:01.108]  Then they had, for several months, they had a secretive trial and then they release all of it after dark.
[03:47:01.588 --> 03:47:04.072]  At the precise time they know people want to riot.
[03:47:04.112 --> 03:47:10.861]  This thing is a, this was engineered to create race riots from the very beginning, I believe.
[03:47:10.901 --> 03:47:17.431]  It was not there to really talk about the real problems of racism or to talk about the real problems of excessive use of police force.
[03:47:19.085 --> 03:47:34.299]  The whole thing it looks very corrupt and I mean you could just feel it happening and I said when I was watching it on TV I said you know what Satan won tonight because when you look all you see is the images of anarchy and fire and it looked as if
[03:47:34.879 --> 03:47:46.372]  It was Satan having his way and showing the world that no matter how much you may want justice or what you think is right, no matter what side you're on, tonight is all about anarchy.
[03:47:50.036 --> 03:47:59.402]  I don't like how it's the two-sided media where you got Fox News who automatically will promote, you know, George Zimmerman or Darren Wilson.
[03:47:59.422 --> 03:48:03.865]  And you have MSNBC who will automatically get on the side of the Mike Browns.
[03:48:03.925 --> 03:48:09.148]  And it just separates people just having those two stations battling each day.
[03:48:09.168 --> 03:48:12.731]  I mean, you know, if you feel like getting in the race... It's the left-right paradigm.
[03:48:12.891 --> 03:48:13.451]  It's the left-right.
[03:48:13.471 --> 03:48:14.112]  They give you
[03:48:14.972 --> 03:48:17.993]  Two choices, both of which are control from the top.
[03:48:18.313 --> 03:48:23.874]  And they have those two forces pick an issue and fight against each other so you can pick one side or the other.
[03:48:24.234 --> 03:48:28.896]  They're not going to talk about the real substantive third issue, which is excessive police violence.
[03:48:29.116 --> 03:48:34.257]  They're going to, if they talk about it at all, they'll talk about it in the context of racism and racism alone.
[03:48:34.957 --> 03:48:35.837]  Thank you so much, Jeremy.
[03:48:35.857 --> 03:48:39.878]  Let's go to, I want to try to get everybody a chance here, Zachary in Florida.
[03:48:39.938 --> 03:48:40.558]  Zachary, go ahead.
[03:48:41.899 --> 03:48:42.119]  Hello.
[03:48:43.106 --> 03:48:45.427]  Yeah, I was calling about the Ferguson riots.
[03:48:46.127 --> 03:48:51.548]  I think they're actually kind of justified due to the fact that everybody is so angry.
[03:48:51.668 --> 03:48:56.190]  Everybody is so fed up at how the government has been treating us.
[03:48:56.750 --> 03:49:01.291]  And in our Constitution, it says we are allowed to dismantle our government if it's not working.
[03:49:01.883 --> 03:49:02.564]  Which, it's not.
[03:49:03.004 --> 03:49:09.289]  But if we try to dismantle it, we're automatically branded as terrorists or whatever, you know what I'm saying?
[03:49:09.369 --> 03:49:10.610]  I agree, I agree.
[03:49:10.670 --> 03:49:13.473]  Let me kick in there with a different example, okay?
[03:49:13.513 --> 03:49:19.518]  Now, as one of the callers was talking about earlier in our live coverage, we had Joe Biggs there last night.
[03:49:19.618 --> 03:49:27.865]  We had, there was a man, he was yelling at the top of his lungs, obscenities, at the cops, and he had a gun on his side, but he was not pointing the gun at them.
[03:49:28.385 --> 03:49:29.386]  He did not shoot first.
[03:49:29.886 --> 03:49:32.128]  He was telling them, if you shoot, we're going to shoot back.
[03:49:33.049 --> 03:49:34.710]  Let me compare this to the Bundy Ranch.
[03:49:35.270 --> 03:49:37.872]  Because of the Bundy Ranch, they had a clear objective.
[03:49:38.513 --> 03:49:43.077]  They did not wait a long time to let the government get ahead of this thing.
[03:49:43.777 --> 03:49:47.020]  And they made it clear that they were willing to take a bullet
[03:49:47.600 --> 03:49:50.442]  If necessary, to get what they wanted.
[03:49:50.582 --> 03:49:53.545]  And what they wanted was for the police to stand down.
[03:49:53.585 --> 03:49:58.188]  They were sick and tired of seeing their neighbors brutalized over a period of a couple of weeks.
[03:49:58.568 --> 03:50:01.410]  And so you had ranchers come together in defense of that.
[03:50:01.470 --> 03:50:03.392]  They had an objective where they could get the cattle back.
[03:50:03.432 --> 03:50:09.096]  But it was really about standing up to the police and saying, you're not going to do this to us.
[03:50:09.336 --> 03:50:14.060]  I saw a clip of one of the older cowboys who had come over from Arizona.
[03:50:14.800 --> 03:50:19.044]  Uh, who was, he considered himself to be a neighbor because the distances there are so great.
[03:50:19.385 --> 03:50:23.048]  But he said, you're not going to taser a man on a horse.
[03:50:23.188 --> 03:50:30.415]  We saw you taser women, take them down from behind, but you're not going to taser a man on a thousand pound animal.
[03:50:30.675 --> 03:50:31.917]  You're going to have to shoot him off.
[03:50:31.937 --> 03:50:33.738]  You're going to have to shoot me off of this horse.
[03:50:33.758 --> 03:50:35.280]  We're not going to stand for this anymore.
[03:50:35.940 --> 03:50:37.001]  That's what people need to do.
[03:50:37.061 --> 03:50:37.841]  They need to stand up.
[03:50:37.881 --> 03:50:38.902]  They need to do it peacefully.
[03:50:38.942 --> 03:50:44.405]  They need to have leaders who are going to stand up and put a legitimate face on this.
[03:50:44.765 --> 03:50:54.331]  And that's why we need to work with our people at the local level, at the state level, to stand up to this federal tyranny because that's where these rules of engagement are coming from.
[03:50:54.771 --> 03:50:57.773]  It's not that Eric Holder is going to do anything to stop this.
[03:50:58.213 --> 03:50:59.034]  They're the ones who are
[03:50:59.714 --> 03:51:02.355]  Infowarslife.com.

[03:51:21.824 --> 03:51:26.826]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line.
[03:51:26.966 --> 03:51:38.629]  Because they are not of the very highest quality, or because they're not 100% organic, or because they don't pass all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at Infowarslife.com.
[03:51:38.769 --> 03:51:49.712]  Whether it's survival shield nascent iodine, or DNA force, super male vitality, super female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shield, oxy powder, I believe
[03:51:49.912 --> 03:51:50.433]  We're good.
[03:52:08.686 --> 03:52:12.328]  We all have our own idea about what being safe and secure means.
[03:52:12.669 --> 03:52:17.892]  The doors lock, bills are paid, you've got a job that keeps the lights on, and a home to call your own.
[03:52:18.172 --> 03:52:20.574]  But what happens when Mother Nature throws a curveball?
[03:52:23.395 --> 03:52:27.320]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time?
[03:52:27.681 --> 03:52:29.203]  Do you even have a plan B?
[03:52:29.783 --> 03:52:32.787]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[03:52:33.067 --> 03:52:35.651]  Children left with no homes and no one's coming to help them.
[03:52:36.151 --> 03:52:38.995]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster.
[03:52:39.155 --> 03:52:39.715]  We're good to go.
[03:53:08.266 --> 03:53:13.269]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[03:54:15.987 --> 03:54:21.310]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight.
[03:54:21.350 --> 03:54:27.213]  We're going into, we've been in overdrive for nearly an hour trying to take people's calls on this Ferguson issue.
[03:54:27.514 --> 03:54:31.376]  Let's go quickly so we can go through everybody, as many people as we can here.
[03:54:31.396 --> 03:54:33.017]  Let's go to Matt in Louisiana.
[03:54:33.057 --> 03:54:33.277]  Matt?
[03:54:35.638 --> 03:54:36.558]  Hello Matt, are you there?
[03:54:37.659 --> 03:54:37.859]  Yeah.
[03:54:38.279 --> 03:54:38.920]  Hey, go ahead.
[03:54:41.354 --> 03:54:45.099]  My issue on Ferguson, the whole thing seemed really strange.
[03:54:45.660 --> 03:54:54.310]  The time they started it, the random bullets, I didn't hear about any victims, the times of the fires, it all seemed kind of fake and set up.
[03:54:55.717 --> 03:54:56.878]  Yeah, I believe so too.
[03:54:56.958 --> 03:55:00.741]  I think that they've done everything that they can from the very beginning to exacerbate this.
[03:55:01.842 --> 03:55:08.987]  In terms of the timing of when they released evidence, that would have shown that the officer acted at least in some degree to self-defense.
[03:55:09.427 --> 03:55:11.849]  If not totally, they took a very long time to do that.
[03:55:12.229 --> 03:55:16.973]  And of course, the timing in which they released this was just the icing on the cake to do this at 8 o'clock.
[03:55:17.493 --> 03:55:18.314]  Just amazing to me.
[03:55:18.734 --> 03:55:19.595]  Did you have any other comment?
[03:55:20.922 --> 03:55:23.002]  Yeah, you said about the guy in Walmart.
[03:55:23.022 --> 03:55:39.386]  The reason why I think, you know, they don't blow up about, you know, that like they did to Ferguson is because, you know, the protests and, you know, all the random looting and the violence actually makes the police look in a way better for this whole situation.
[03:55:39.546 --> 03:55:46.288]  And if they would bring it up on like the case in Walmart, of course, there's no way that that would make us look bad because, you know, it was,
[03:55:47.208 --> 03:55:51.332]  We have to be smart about how we pick our battles, and we have to be smart about how we fight our battles.
[03:55:51.552 --> 03:56:08.708]  And to do this, they are basically fighting on their terms, and that is making the police look as if it's necessary to have full-on militarization, that they're the only thing standing between you and race riots when they have fomented these race riots, in my opinion.
[03:56:09.408 --> 03:56:10.949]  From the very beginning of the way they released this.
[03:56:10.969 --> 03:56:11.409]  Thank you, Matt.
[03:56:11.429 --> 03:56:12.309]  Let's move on quickly.
[03:56:12.709 --> 03:56:13.469]  Truth Raider in Oregon.
[03:56:13.489 --> 03:56:15.130]  You said you had three words to describe this.
[03:56:15.150 --> 03:56:15.950]  I'm gonna give you your shot.
[03:56:16.350 --> 03:56:16.690]  Go ahead.
[03:56:16.710 --> 03:56:17.230]  Three words.
[03:56:18.871 --> 03:56:19.231]  David!
[03:56:19.471 --> 03:56:19.691]  Hey.
[03:56:19.771 --> 03:56:21.192]  Have you ever heard of Mae Brussell?
[03:56:21.752 --> 03:56:24.853]  A legendary broadcaster back in the early 1970s through the 1980s.
[03:56:25.053 --> 03:56:25.273]  No.
[03:56:25.313 --> 03:56:25.873]  Not familiar one.
[03:56:26.813 --> 03:56:28.134]  She describes it very best.
[03:56:28.154 --> 03:56:28.434]  Go on.
[03:56:28.474 --> 03:56:31.155]  You can go online on YouTube and type in Mae Brussell.
[03:56:31.175 --> 03:56:31.635]  Mm-hmm.
[03:56:31.875 --> 03:56:32.295]  Broadcast.
[03:56:32.355 --> 03:56:33.515]  And she was legendary.
[03:56:33.555 --> 03:56:36.456]  She was one of those that broadcasted all this material a long time ago.
[03:56:36.536 --> 03:56:37.157]  Three words.
[03:56:37.657 --> 03:56:37.877]  Mm-hmm.
[03:56:37.977 --> 03:56:38.337]  That she
[03:56:43.027 --> 03:56:43.227]  Yes.
[03:56:43.547 --> 03:56:44.147]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:56:44.727 --> 03:56:45.087]  That's right.
[03:56:45.447 --> 03:56:48.728]  It's about creating a dichotomy here.
[03:56:49.248 --> 03:56:53.648]  You've got, you know, one, you've got a thesis and an antithesis, right?
[03:56:53.788 --> 03:56:55.049]  That's what they have always done.
[03:56:55.109 --> 03:56:57.009]  That's what the Democrats and the Republicans are about.
[03:56:57.049 --> 03:56:59.089]  That's why they only want to give us two parties.
[03:56:59.489 --> 03:57:03.750]  So everything has to be broken into these phony two choices.
[03:57:03.790 --> 03:57:04.910]  And that's what they're doing right now.
[03:57:04.950 --> 03:57:06.951]  They're portraying this as a race war.
[03:57:07.331 --> 03:57:08.251]  And of course, you need
[03:57:08.951 --> 03:57:14.074]  Bigger, stronger, more militarized police departments to protect you from this race war.
[03:57:14.154 --> 03:57:14.915]  Thank you, Truth Raider.
[03:57:14.955 --> 03:57:17.496]  Let's quickly move on to Josh in Virginia.
[03:57:17.536 --> 03:57:17.896]  Josh.
[03:57:19.837 --> 03:57:20.618]  Hey, Mr. Knight.
[03:57:20.638 --> 03:57:21.979]  It's an honor to speak with you.
[03:57:21.999 --> 03:57:23.239]  I'm an admirer of your work.
[03:57:23.520 --> 03:57:24.760]  Well, thank you.
[03:57:25.161 --> 03:57:31.144]  I know we don't have much time, but I wanted to briefly touch on the protests going on around the country that seem to have been censored so far today.
[03:57:31.584 --> 03:57:31.885]  Yes.
[03:57:31.905 --> 03:57:34.146]  We were watching live stream New York City.
[03:57:34.186 --> 03:57:35.907]  They took over the Triborough Bridge.
[03:57:36.420 --> 03:57:42.024]  And it was citizen journalists right there on the front line where we were able to watch this just enthralled all night.
[03:57:42.104 --> 03:57:45.527]  And then, you know, the next day, my wife has family in New York.
[03:57:45.547 --> 03:57:46.548]  They knew nothing about it.
[03:57:46.588 --> 03:57:47.589]  They weren't reporting on it.
[03:57:47.909 --> 03:57:51.732]  There were scenes in Oakland of the protesters and the cops.
[03:57:52.290 --> 03:57:52.770]  We're good to go.
[03:58:08.303 --> 03:58:10.284]  People almost just need a reason now.
[03:58:10.324 --> 03:58:11.564]  They're so fed up.
[03:58:11.844 --> 03:58:25.528]  A trigger event could happen, maybe not now because again, this was all state managed it looks like from the get-go, but if something really were to happen and people were to take to the streets, the power really does lie with the people and you were able to see it only through the social media.
[03:58:25.688 --> 03:58:26.208]  That's true.
[03:58:26.768 --> 03:58:27.169]  That's true.
[03:58:27.209 --> 03:58:27.829]  Thank you, Josh.
[03:58:28.149 --> 03:58:35.411]  Yeah, there are some links up on Drudge about protests that are going on in other parts of the country and of course there was a grievous shooting this weekend in New York.
[03:58:36.071 --> 03:58:38.052]  Now that's it for today, but join us tonight.
[03:58:38.072 --> 03:58:41.393]  We're going to have the nightly news live at 7 central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:41.473 --> 03:58:41.854]  Eastern.
[03:58:41.894 --> 03:58:44.195]  More reports from Ferguson and our reporters who are there.
[03:58:44.895 --> 03:58:50.917]  Join us then.
[03:58:50.957 --> 03:58:52.818]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:53.579 --> 03:58:54.759]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:59:01.287 --> 03:59:02.347]  In the near future.
[03:59:02.627 --> 03:59:04.968]  Do you realize how fake it all is?
