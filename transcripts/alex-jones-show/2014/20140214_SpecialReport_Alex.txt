[00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:07.651]  Guns.com is reporting that an 18-year-old Maryland student has gotten into trouble for leaving an unloaded shotgun in his car.
[00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:15.533]  The article says that a person was checking for parking stickers and noticed the gun covered in clothing in the backseat of the young man's car.
[00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:19.454]  The student was pulled out of class and arrested in the principal's presence.
[00:00:20.174 --> 00:00:26.378]  The student claims that he had gone hunting the night before and forgot that he had the gun in his car, but made attempts to cover it up.
[00:00:26.978 --> 00:00:31.080]  Unprescribed ADHD medication was also found in the student's vehicle.
[00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:38.785]  The report says that authorities found no ill intent on the student's behalf, but he could still be expelled if the school says so.
[00:00:39.265 --> 00:00:41.827]  Yes, he was on school grounds with a weapon.
[00:00:41.867 --> 00:00:44.548]  You know, they have the zero tolerance, these gun-free zones.
[00:00:44.748 --> 00:00:45.549]  Many schools are.
[00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.390]  But he made a reasonable attempt to cover up the gun.
[00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:56.914]  You know, people who actually own firearms know that you may occasionally find yourself in a situation where you're not supposed to have your gun and you have it on you anyway.
[00:00:57.334 --> 00:00:58.214]  So I feel for the guy.
[00:00:58.294 --> 00:01:00.395]  I definitely don't want this to be a scourge.
[00:01:00.855 --> 00:01:05.618]  And if you're one of these people who says, you know, this can never happen to me or, you know, he deserves whatever he gets.
[00:01:05.998 --> 00:01:07.018]  Take a look at this guy.
[00:01:07.598 --> 00:01:13.021]  He is a, I guess you can't call him an anti-gun advocate, but he is a gun control advocate.
[00:01:13.841 --> 00:01:16.664]  He went into school with a gun on his person.
[00:01:16.864 --> 00:01:23.951]  So even people who are for stricter gun laws occasionally find themselves in the situation where they have a gun on them.
[00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:38.364]  And if you're one of these people who are absolute hate guns, hate anybody bringing a gun on campus, you say both these guys, whether it's the young student or the older gun control advocate, you say both these guys deserve whatever they get.
[00:01:39.249 --> 00:02:01.462]  Remember all the stories we've done recently, and I definitely stressed recently, about children being expelled from school, encountering police on different levels because they ate their Pop-Tarts the wrong way, or because they brought in a bubble gun to school, or they made a gun with their fingers, or a bow and arrow with their fingers, or drew a picture of a gun.
[00:02:01.482 --> 00:02:04.984]  I think there's definitely something wrong with this gun control agenda.
[00:02:05.424 --> 00:02:08.366]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:02:09.113 --> 00:02:14.216]  And what we need to do is change the way in which people think about guns, especially young people.
[00:02:14.376 --> 00:02:20.120]  One thing that I think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive about this.
[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.803]  It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday.
[00:02:24.863 --> 00:02:31.748]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:02:40.524 --> 00:02:44.928]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:02:45.228 --> 00:02:47.490]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:57.499]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
[00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:06.041]  That's why we're rolling out on a 100% made in America line of incredible pro-liberty apparel.
[00:03:06.241 --> 00:03:08.782]  We are re-popularizing liberty.
