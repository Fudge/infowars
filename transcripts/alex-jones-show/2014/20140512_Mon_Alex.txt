[00:00:01.714 --> 00:00:04.561]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:00:05.303 --> 00:00:08.512]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:14.727 --> 00:00:15.367]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.028 --> 00:00:17.048]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:18.909]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.549 --> 00:00:20.350]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.011]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.691 --> 00:00:26.293]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.873 --> 00:00:30.975]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.296 --> 00:00:39.139]  You know, quite frankly, I'm getting Ukraine... fatigue.
[00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:49.751]  But I've got to continue to watch it as a real-life dangerous soap opera that could cause thermal nuclear war and extinct human life on this planet.
[00:00:50.852 --> 00:01:02.455]  The old sick joke of everything but the cockroaches and subterranean bacteria would be dead in a full-out nuclear exchange between the Russian Federation and the United States.
[00:01:02.635 --> 00:01:09.117]  Ron Paul has come out in an article on Infowars.com and says, what does the US government want in Ukraine?
[00:01:10.165 --> 00:01:18.632]  Well, the problem with that, and of course Ron Paul's communicating with the public and things they can understand, is that it's not the U.S.
[00:01:18.672 --> 00:01:19.033]  government.
[00:01:19.113 --> 00:01:25.318]  It is the globalists disconnected from their actions through hundreds of layers of separation.
[00:01:26.199 --> 00:01:30.443]  I mean, generals can get you into giant wars because they're separated, but at least they know war.
[00:01:31.183 --> 00:01:36.889]  And it's the generals that continue and the admirals that continue to stop larger wars.
[00:01:38.072 --> 00:01:39.373]  Like the Syria situation.
[00:01:39.773 --> 00:01:43.114]  It was the Pentagon, along with the American people, that said, do not do this.
[00:01:46.496 --> 00:01:57.321]  And it's the Pentagon that continues to put the brakes on what the politicians and the big corporations are doing, who are smart when it comes to psychology and markets and manipulation.
[00:01:57.921 --> 00:02:04.364]  They are not smart long-term messing with other governments that have nuclear weapons.
[00:02:07.546 --> 00:02:09.807]  And you can only buy off so many people in Russia.
[00:02:09.827 --> 00:02:11.989]  You can only buy off so many of the Chinese leadership.
[00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:15.331]  The globalists are playing all these countries off against each other.
[00:02:15.391 --> 00:02:21.014]  I know I say that over and over again, but Russia launched Topol-M missiles, practicing the nuke, the U.S.
[00:02:21.054 --> 00:02:22.094]  and Europe last week.
[00:02:23.515 --> 00:02:26.317]  And now there is another report, U.S.
[00:02:26.337 --> 00:02:32.260]  to conduct strategic bomber exercises, nuclear drills, follow massive Russian war games last week.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.501]  I mean, this is just not good.
[00:02:33.521 --> 00:02:36.423]  I know that's an understatement.
[00:02:37.512 --> 00:02:40.094]  It's so sensational, I don't have words to describe it properly.
[00:02:41.115 --> 00:02:42.956]  It's a bad situation on every front.
[00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:43.757]  I know you know that.
[00:02:44.337 --> 00:02:46.079]  There's been a bunch of developments on that front.
[00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.800]  I was watching these videos at like 6 a.m.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.280]  this morning.
[00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:57.187]  They're all up on Infowars.com of just like mercenaries shooting people that were trying to go vote in areas of eastern Ukraine.
[00:02:57.788 --> 00:02:59.309]  I mean, out and out thugs.
[00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.591]  Like something out of a movie.
[00:03:02.692 --> 00:03:08.136]  Shooting people, beating people, and of course, it's all heroic and historic according to our media.
[00:03:08.796 --> 00:03:09.837]  Totally disgusting.
[00:03:11.078 --> 00:03:19.724]  I mean, it's just an ongoing out-of-control soap op, because at first they're shooting in the air, and then you see them start shooting people, and there's people shot in the crowd.
[00:03:22.886 --> 00:03:24.107]  Just simply amazing.
[00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:28.710]  So, we're going to be getting into all of that today.
[00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:30.712]  Look, I'm gonna cover
[00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:33.846]  The Boko Haram situation.
[00:03:34.486 --> 00:03:37.587]  I've spent about a week watching this and haven't commented much.
[00:03:38.528 --> 00:03:41.609]  And I went and did some research just to confirm my previous research.
[00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:46.351]  Because I have the knowledge, I've done the research, but there's so much research it gets foggy.
[00:03:46.491 --> 00:03:55.475]  And I went, isn't Boko Haram protected and used to manipulate the Christian majority, animist majority, those two together, in Nigeria?
[00:03:56.216 --> 00:03:59.197]  Isn't Boko Haram and the North CIA connected?
[00:04:00.455 --> 00:04:19.127]  And I was sitting there this weekend, and then I was on the elliptical this morning, at the gym, watching MSNBC with the sound off, watching the closed captioning, and I went, look at this propaganda, they were saying lean forward, that's a classic Soviet communist term, well it even predates that, it's Marxist.
[00:04:21.228 --> 00:04:27.833]  And then they showed George Washington, his handout, and said lean forward, like George Washington is for Sovietism.
[00:04:28.613 --> 00:04:29.193]  That was like,
[00:04:31.971 --> 00:04:36.535]  When Obama said Paul Revere would have loved the NSA, and the NSA is Paul Revere.
[00:04:36.575 --> 00:04:37.456]  I mean, just give me a break.
[00:04:38.817 --> 00:04:44.042]  But then, I was sitting there watching Boko Haram with the sound off, and I went, that's staged!
[00:04:44.823 --> 00:04:45.844]  That's totally fake!
[00:04:47.142 --> 00:04:48.843]  And it's just like so much other stuff.
[00:04:48.863 --> 00:04:53.126]  I told you that abortion lady saying she loves getting abortions and holds a picture of the dead baby.
[00:04:53.686 --> 00:04:54.727]  I told her she was an actress.
[00:04:54.907 --> 00:04:56.007]  It came out she was an actress.
[00:04:56.067 --> 00:04:58.149]  I mean, the Boko Haram thing's fake.
[00:04:58.229 --> 00:04:59.609]  I'm gonna explain why I think so.
[00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.611]  I don't have total proof, but I got a lot of evidence.
[00:05:03.332 --> 00:05:04.792]  And watch, it'll come out later, it's staged.
[00:05:06.053 --> 00:05:07.174]  I'm gonna tell you about that when we come back.
[00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:12.838]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:05:13.098 --> 00:05:17.981]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:05:18.242 --> 00:05:26.107]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:05:26.347 --> 00:05:30.670]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.693]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:05:34.833 --> 00:05:40.537]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:05:40.797 --> 00:05:43.579]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:49.183]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:05:49.343 --> 00:05:57.469]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.709]  That's 866-229-0927.
[00:06:04.033 --> 00:06:06.394]  Do business with someone who shares your values.
[00:06:06.674 --> 00:06:09.395]  BuyPatriotsSupply.com slash Alex.
[00:06:10.456 --> 00:06:16.318]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:06:16.338 --> 00:06:19.700]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.381]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:06:21.421 --> 00:06:27.723]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:27.803 --> 00:06:33.686]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the fence on the streets?
[00:06:33.846 --> 00:06:37.608]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:06:37.808 --> 00:06:40.690]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:48.895]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:06:49.155 --> 00:06:51.196]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:06:51.256 --> 00:06:52.297]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:06:52.657 --> 00:07:01.421]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[00:07:01.601 --> 00:07:04.063]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.

[00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:13.204]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:07:13.304 --> 00:07:15.546]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:07:15.726 --> 00:07:24.013]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:07:24.313 --> 00:07:34.542]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:07:34.862 --> 00:07:48.269]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency, Supramel Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:54.772]  Supramel Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:07:55.013 --> 00:08:03.637]  For a limited time, we are offering 15% off Supramel Vitality at InfoWarsLife.com to introduce you to this powerful supplement.

[00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:34.161]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:34.241 --> 00:08:35.722]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:08:45.632 --> 00:08:53.297]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Monday, already the 12th day of May 2014.
[00:08:53.957 --> 00:08:56.799]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:08:56.819 --> 00:09:04.523]  We're going to be here live for the next three hours, as we are weekdays, 11am to 2pm.
[00:09:05.303 --> 00:09:12.388]  Dr. Steve Pachinick is going to be joining us, former head of psychological warfare operations for the State Department.
[00:09:13.288 --> 00:09:14.489]  Director of the CIA.
[00:09:15.129 --> 00:09:22.073]  He was over the psychiatric psyops for the Camp David Accords successfully.
[00:09:22.973 --> 00:09:26.896]  And he was over a lot of different Delta Force operations.
[00:09:27.436 --> 00:09:28.737]  Most of them clandestine.
[00:09:28.757 --> 00:09:30.558]  He, of course, worked for the Bushes and others.
[00:09:31.318 --> 00:09:32.259]  Very interesting guy.
[00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:33.259]  People ask, why do I have him on?
[00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:35.120]  Well, he co-wrote a bunch of Tom Clancy's books.
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.642]  He's got a new book coming out with some of the work of Tom Clancy.
[00:09:39.042 --> 00:09:40.463]  He's produced a bunch of big movies.
[00:09:40.903 --> 00:09:41.944]  And he's a big insider.
[00:09:43.252 --> 00:09:45.573]  And he wants to cover the waterfront with us today.
[00:09:45.613 --> 00:09:47.573]  We'll pick his brain.
[00:09:47.613 --> 00:09:49.434]  I'm sure he'll be trying to pick ours.
[00:09:51.195 --> 00:09:52.115]  He's a listener of the show.
[00:09:54.336 --> 00:10:01.978]  Dr. Steve Pchenik, medical doctor and psychiatrist and former Navy captain, will be joining us.
[00:10:03.138 --> 00:10:05.339]  This is a Navy commander or whatever it is above captain.
[00:10:05.699 --> 00:10:08.440]  So that is coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.321]  He'll be with us about 45 minutes in the second hour.
[00:10:13.012 --> 00:10:18.855]  Now, all of that said, before I get into U.S.
[00:10:18.875 --> 00:10:40.844]  to conduct strategic bomber exercises practicing nuking Russia, before I get into the incredible new developments in Ukraine with Ukrainian government, Soros-controlled forces shooting people trying to vote, and there's video of this, it's pretty amazing, before we get into all the rest of the news breaking here domestically, and there is a lot of it,
[00:10:44.315 --> 00:10:55.781]  I have held my tongue on Boko Haram for about a week since this broke, as I cogitated on it, and as I did research.
[00:10:57.802 --> 00:11:09.968]  And there are thousands of points that go into this, literally thousands of points, so I tend to get caught up trying to give you all my data points of why I'm telling you something before I ever get to what I'm going to say.
[00:11:11.428 --> 00:11:12.269]  But let me just say this.
[00:11:13.188 --> 00:11:32.279]  We know Boko Haram is working for Western intelligence agencies as a Central Western or Western Central destabilization force similar to the Kony 2012 movement using a dead boogeyman or bogey.
[00:11:33.739 --> 00:11:34.100]  Kony.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.982]  Kony 2012 which we know was a government psyop that came out.
[00:11:39.244 --> 00:11:43.425]  Just like they had PSYOPs to overthrow the Ukrainian government that were State Department funded on record.
[00:11:45.726 --> 00:11:49.407]  They would say in the videos, I'm grassroots, I'm filming this myself, no one told me to do it.
[00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:54.248]  And then it would end up it was an actress funded publicly by the State Department.
[00:11:55.648 --> 00:11:57.308]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[00:11:58.229 --> 00:12:02.950]  So I knew Bokum Haram, or Boku Haram,
[00:12:04.468 --> 00:12:06.488]  Was a double, triple agent operation.
[00:12:07.569 --> 00:12:09.649]  Because the majority are Christian and animist.
[00:12:10.149 --> 00:12:17.751]  If you add those two groups together in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, like 300 million people or something now, almost, I mean, this is incredible.
[00:12:19.371 --> 00:12:28.613]  And that they're being used as a pretext to basically militarize the central government that again is Christian slash animist, or earth worship group.
[00:12:29.608 --> 00:12:38.753]  And that they're playing that group off against them so that Nigeria will take Western aid and more IMF World Bank funding and so they can be controlled by the globalists.
[00:12:41.114 --> 00:12:44.896]  It's just like they brought AFRICAN the last few years into Africa.
[00:12:44.936 --> 00:12:46.937]  They took out Libya, put Al-Qaeda in.
[00:12:47.237 --> 00:12:52.020]  The federal government admitted last week that, oh my gosh, it was a total screw-up taking out Qaddafi.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.040]  It's horrible there now.
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.221]  No colleges.
[00:12:54.261 --> 00:12:55.641]  The women are having burkas put on their heads.
[00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:58.303]  And Al-Qaeda is using it to launch attacks all over Africa.
[00:12:59.008 --> 00:13:03.352]  It was a perfect military base for clandestine Al-Qaeda operations in Libya.
[00:13:03.712 --> 00:13:04.433]  That was the plan.
[00:13:04.473 --> 00:13:05.554]  Now the U.S.
[00:13:05.694 --> 00:13:19.425]  military, and the French military, and Ivory Coast, and North Africa, everywhere else, can come in and invade, and they just say on the news it's to fight Al-Qaeda, but even the president of the Ivory Coast earlier this year said no.
[00:13:20.672 --> 00:13:28.897]  It is white mercenaries taking over the oil rigs, and then NATO shows up with France to kick them out, and takes the nation's oil rigs.
[00:13:31.118 --> 00:13:32.779]  And the presidential palace blows up.
[00:13:33.139 --> 00:13:34.940]  You know, it was in a couple of those.
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:39.443]  Ivory Coast is one country, there's a couple others, Sierra Leone, you name it.
[00:13:40.043 --> 00:13:45.126]  I mean, so much of this is going on, I can't even keep track of it, and I know the countries and the players.
[00:13:46.744 --> 00:13:48.205]  In Guyana and all the rest of it.
[00:13:48.225 --> 00:13:50.428]  I mean, it's just full-out war in Africa.
[00:13:51.909 --> 00:13:54.031]  And the governments even get it.
[00:13:54.491 --> 00:13:57.414]  These are pro-Western governments that are being double-crossed, by the way.
[00:13:58.375 --> 00:14:02.959]  These are Christians and tribalists, animists, you name it.
[00:14:02.999 --> 00:14:04.121]  They're not even Muslims.
[00:14:05.101 --> 00:14:09.526]  And they're in the news, you can pull it up, saying, this is staged.
[00:14:09.966 --> 00:14:11.588]  They run the radical Muslims.
[00:14:13.678 --> 00:14:19.443]  So I wanted to go over some of this to explain what's happening, but basically it's just a smokescreen.
[00:14:21.745 --> 00:14:27.069]  Now there's the global research headline, CIA covert ops in Nigeria, fertile ground for US-sponsored Balkanization.
[00:14:27.729 --> 00:14:31.813]  And that's an article from, I guess, two days ago.
[00:14:32.694 --> 00:14:35.496]  So the folks at Global Research get it too, they're very sophisticated.
[00:14:37.202 --> 00:14:38.323]  And, I mean, they should be.
[00:14:38.363 --> 00:14:41.226]  They're tied into the continent of Europe and the Russians.
[00:14:41.987 --> 00:14:45.571]  But the point is, is that that is what's going on.
[00:14:47.857 --> 00:14:57.782]  And it's so complex on the surface, and it's complex in its depths, but it's also simple when you understand the overall program, create chaos.
[00:14:58.242 --> 00:15:01.463]  They're not for the Muslims, they're not for the Christians, they're not for the animist.
[00:15:02.064 --> 00:15:16.871]  They are for destabilization, balkanization, crises, so the UN, NATO, and the globalists and AFRICOM can come in then with martial plans for Europe, martial plans for Africa, martial plans for Pakistan.
[00:15:17.711 --> 00:15:18.511]  I mean, why did the U.S.
[00:15:18.551 --> 00:15:28.614]  government fly 44,000 Taliban al-Qaeda leaders and top military and al-Qaeda in the airlift of evil two months after the war started in 2001?
[00:15:29.434 --> 00:15:32.635]  Why did they fly them out in November, started in September?
[00:15:33.855 --> 00:15:36.355]  Why did they fly them out and give them weapons and gold?
[00:15:37.476 --> 00:15:42.917]  Also, untraceable gold to buy more weapons to then attack and destabilize and infiltrate the government of Pakistan.
[00:15:44.551 --> 00:15:57.194]  Just like they're attacking Syria using Al-Qaeda, and arming them in Iraq, and they don't care about Al-Qaeda that attacks our troops, or even our own mercenaries, I say ours, the globalists, in Iraq, because that's a reason to still be in Iraq!
[00:15:58.634 --> 00:16:00.555]  Killing is the business, business is good.
[00:16:00.795 --> 00:16:03.455]  They get it coming and going, all directions.
[00:16:03.776 --> 00:16:05.216]  And I know you know this.
[00:16:06.136 --> 00:16:08.657]  This is what the British did with the opium wars in China.
[00:16:09.237 --> 00:16:10.717]  This is what the Norman did.
[00:16:11.737 --> 00:16:12.578]  Which are really the British.
[00:16:13.018 --> 00:16:13.958]  The British system.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:43.213]  The Vikings took over France, and then they ran off and took over Germany, what was a group of Germanic states, and they've been doing this system where they, again, you'd have Norman, British, Norman, French, they'd have uprisings, they'd have a war, people would line up under the leader, and they would then kill off their populations, and those letters are public, going back 800 years ago, 500 years ago, right through the last 100 years, and you had German kings
[00:16:44.324 --> 00:16:46.986]  Running England, who would then have wars with Germany.
[00:16:48.668 --> 00:16:50.769]  This is how they do it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:55.373]  And other people, I guess, just aren't smart enough to figure this out.
[00:16:57.335 --> 00:16:59.636]  And of course, the Chinese engaged in Balkanization.
[00:16:59.917 --> 00:17:01.198]  Kublai Khan engaged in it.
[00:17:01.918 --> 00:17:03.179]  The Huns engaged in it.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.381]  The Japanese engaged in it.
[00:17:05.481 --> 00:17:07.523]  The samurai groups and shoguns.
[00:17:07.543 --> 00:17:09.945]  I mean, this is the system of control.
[00:17:10.565 --> 00:17:12.527]  And people had better figure it out
[00:17:14.522 --> 00:17:15.242]  Or it's game over.
[00:17:15.282 --> 00:17:17.963]  But just here's one example today on this from Breitbart.
[00:17:18.943 --> 00:17:24.164]  Hillary Clinton protested designation of Boko Haram as terrorist group.
[00:17:24.864 --> 00:17:35.766]  While Secretary of State Hillary Clinton fought hard against officially designating the Islamist to Boko Haram as a terror group, placing her in the camp of far leftist group MoveOn.org.
[00:17:36.046 --> 00:17:37.806]  They're not far left, folks.
[00:17:38.086 --> 00:17:39.906]  George Soros was a Nazi collaborator.
[00:17:41.787 --> 00:17:42.487]  He funds MoveOn.
[00:17:43.561 --> 00:17:46.103]  They have to cover every area of the chessboard.
[00:17:46.123 --> 00:17:51.366]  They have to be the liberal opposition, so no real opposition to war forms.
[00:17:53.568 --> 00:17:56.390]  It's like The Thing, the 1980s John Carpenter film.
[00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:00.853]  It plans to take over the whole world, ladies and gentlemen, and it will play the part of every group.
[00:18:01.773 --> 00:18:02.894]  That's why it keeps winning.
[00:18:04.995 --> 00:18:09.318]  Hillary Clinton is an ultra-wicked anti-human garbage.
[00:18:10.299 --> 00:18:11.540]  A psychopathic demon.
[00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:15.104]  A full-spectrum dominance worm.
[00:18:18.186 --> 00:18:24.491]  But right here, why do you think you saw Michelle Obama last week, sickeningly, saying, bring back her girls, with a look.
[00:18:24.551 --> 00:18:25.692]  It gives them moral high ground.
[00:18:25.732 --> 00:18:27.434]  Look, we're fighting radical Islam.
[00:18:27.634 --> 00:18:29.175]  Look, we care about women's rights.
[00:18:29.536 --> 00:18:31.878]  Meanwhile, the group is globalist-run.
[00:18:32.798 --> 00:18:41.246]  And they're going to use it to invade all of Africa, to quote, hunt down anybody they want, bypassing radical Muslims, and going right at the Christians they kill all over Africa.
[00:18:42.042 --> 00:18:42.643]  Just like the U.N.
[00:18:42.663 --> 00:18:44.365]  did in 1994 in Rwanda.
[00:18:45.506 --> 00:18:46.427]  That wasn't a U.N.
[00:18:46.487 --> 00:18:47.027]  screw-up.
[00:18:47.107 --> 00:18:50.171]  I mean, and everybody goes, look at Michelle, she's so upset.
[00:18:50.271 --> 00:18:51.252]  This is sick!
[00:18:52.013 --> 00:18:58.560]  Boko Haram in the North is being given globalist aid to break that country in two and destabilize all of Western Africa.
[00:19:02.162 --> 00:19:05.804]  Just like Kony 2012 was meant to push for an invasion of Africa.
[00:19:05.824 --> 00:19:08.105]  It's just like, did you see that crazy looking guy?
[00:19:08.425 --> 00:19:10.906]  Saying, we want your women, they're going to be our slaves, ha ha ha.
[00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:14.528]  Out of central casting, guaranteed being directed.
[00:19:15.108 --> 00:19:24.253]  I wouldn't be surprised if somebody like... Who's the guy that, Jerry Bruckheimer.
[00:19:25.033 --> 00:19:26.274]  He did Blackhawk down the movie.
[00:19:26.534 --> 00:19:28.995]  Bruckheimer got caught running the save it, bribing Lynch thing.
[00:19:30.182 --> 00:19:31.603]  That was fake, that came out in BBC.
[00:19:31.903 --> 00:19:35.724]  Totally fake, with sat video, shot and directed by him.
[00:19:36.104 --> 00:19:37.124]  Totally fake, saving her.
[00:19:37.285 --> 00:19:37.845]  It's all come out.
[00:19:40.366 --> 00:19:42.426]  In fact, I bet Jerry Bruckheimer's involved.
[00:19:42.446 --> 00:19:44.307]  He might have been there, directing that.
[00:19:44.847 --> 00:19:46.648]  That might have been directed in Lanley, Virginia.
[00:19:47.688 --> 00:19:52.410]  Just like the leader of Al-Qaeda, Adam Gadahn, is the son of the former head of the ADL.
[00:19:54.031 --> 00:20:03.906]  And then, uh, Wired Magazine had a symposium, and they looked at the Al Qaeda logo next to the Pentagon logo, and it was uploaded in the same video layer.
[00:20:05.808 --> 00:20:07.130]  I'm gonna explain it all when we get back.
[00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:07.491]  Stay with me.
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.941]  Tired of taking handfuls of vitamin pills?
[00:20:12.141 --> 00:20:16.863]  Look and feel super with a great-tasting lipid vitamin and mineral supplement called Passion For Life.

[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.303]  So my elementary school-aged child is begging me for a cell phone.
[00:20:43.363 --> 00:20:44.463]  Please, Mom, please!
[00:20:44.664 --> 00:20:45.624]  All the kids have them!
[00:20:45.664 --> 00:20:55.272]  But I've seen the research, and it makes sense to me that any mobile device that operates using electromagnetic frequencies that close to me or my child's head needs to be blocked.
[00:20:55.712 --> 00:20:57.833]  Harmful wireless radiation is real.

[00:21:07.036 --> 00:21:08.857]  Enhancing health and privacy.
[00:21:08.877 --> 00:21:12.818]  It's been said, those who control the food, control the people.
[00:21:13.098 --> 00:21:16.820]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:22.843]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[00:21:23.103 --> 00:21:33.188]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods, and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system, which accounts for 80% of your immune system.

[00:22:09.078 --> 00:22:11.660]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.784]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at My Patriot Supply.
[00:22:17.044 --> 00:22:24.891]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:22:25.151 --> 00:22:29.456]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:22:29.677 --> 00:22:33.501]  By Patriots Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:22:33.661 --> 00:22:39.368]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:22:39.609 --> 00:22:40.009]  It is rare
[00:22:40.029 --> 00:22:40.249]  We're good.
[00:23:08.807 --> 00:23:15.373]  Heart and Body Extract continues to receive positive testimonials from people who have experienced amazing results, like Reid.
[00:23:15.393 --> 00:23:21.218]  I just wanted to send you a quick but a very big thank you for Heart and Body Extract.
[00:23:21.578 --> 00:23:29.265]  I've been on the formula for nearly a month now, and the improvement in the circulation of my legs has been simply amazing.
[00:23:29.665 --> 00:23:31.307]  Reid was facing a tough choice.
[00:23:31.647 --> 00:23:38.554]  I was facing surgery due to the severity of a 100% blocked artery in both my legs.
[00:23:38.995 --> 00:23:48.725]  And my decision, waiting for surgery to say no and try heart and body extract instead, has been thankfully the right decision.
[00:23:48.865 --> 00:23:49.606]  And the result?
[00:23:49.766 --> 00:23:53.250]  I can now walk up steps without noticeable pain.
[00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:56.132]  Order Heart and Body Extract at 866-295-5305, 866-295-5305 or HBextract.com.
[00:23:56.172 --> 00:23:59.035]  Heart and Body Extract, for a long and healthy life!
[00:24:18.076 --> 00:24:33.970]  Every move the globalists make, every breath they take, the organic human defense force of seven and a half billion people will be watching everything they do.
[00:24:36.652 --> 00:24:44.319]  The people are aware of what's going on and are learning about the tricks of the globalists.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.723]  And we are expanding our understanding every single day.
[00:25:01.736 --> 00:25:18.299]  Northern and central areas of Nigeria and Western Africa is a destabilization force of the globalists, of the mercenaries, of the big diamond companies, of the corrupt elements of the oil companies that want to have a pretext to have Africa in squalor and not stabilize.
[00:25:18.419 --> 00:25:27.561]  Same reason they brought down Libya and put Al-Qaeda in, and now the news says, oh my gosh, Al-Qaeda is operating inside
[00:25:28.968 --> 00:25:32.170]  Of almost every African country, we've got to invade all of them!
[00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:34.031]  They've got a base in Libya!
[00:25:34.571 --> 00:25:35.312]  This is terrible!
[00:25:35.372 --> 00:25:39.634]  And no one in the media and the controlled press goes, why did we put Al-Qaeda in charge there?
[00:25:39.954 --> 00:25:41.295]  Why did we give them heavy weapons?
[00:25:41.735 --> 00:25:45.877]  Why did we overthrow a guy that had been working with the West for eight years, Muammar Gaddafi?
[00:25:46.438 --> 00:25:50.240]  Well, why is our government trying to overthrow Syria and using Al-Qaeda?
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.081]  Because they want destabilization.
[00:25:53.121 --> 00:25:54.142]  Now, I know you know that.
[00:25:54.662 --> 00:25:57.704]  But inner people like Bill Maher,
[00:25:59.435 --> 00:26:02.238]  Coming up in the next segment, we're going to play a big clip of this with Dinesh D'Souza.
[00:26:03.359 --> 00:26:05.520]  And he's saying, no, all of Islam is bad.
[00:26:07.122 --> 00:26:08.983]  And then attaching it to Christianity.
[00:26:12.046 --> 00:26:13.007]  And, you know, religion's bad.
[00:26:13.027 --> 00:26:17.791]  Well, what about his religion of big government and his religion of eugenics and kill more people?
[00:26:18.091 --> 00:26:19.312]  I want to get the highway moving.
[00:26:19.592 --> 00:26:21.154]  I guess he would like Boku Haram.
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:34.703]  You have to understand, his God, Obama, his God, Hillary, his God, the New World Order, is literally funding and helping every radical jihad group out there, except for Hezbollah, run by the Iranians.
[00:26:35.603 --> 00:26:45.945]  The only real terrorist group, according to the West, the group you could call a real independent Islamic Shiite group that really does blow stuff up and kill people,
[00:26:46.733 --> 00:26:53.516]  Usually as a response, I'm not defending that, I'm just saying, they use asymmetrical warfare, you want to call them terrorists, go ahead, is Iran.
[00:26:53.856 --> 00:26:54.376]  That's it.
[00:26:55.957 --> 00:27:01.279]  The Saudi Arabian variant, Al Qaeda, that's the main group, is run by the globalists.
[00:27:01.459 --> 00:27:04.140]  That's public knowledge for anyone who's not a moron.
[00:27:05.981 --> 00:27:07.541]  That's a pretty big revelation, though, isn't it?
[00:27:07.801 --> 00:27:09.302]  And it's hanging out in plain view.
[00:27:09.662 --> 00:27:20.545]  And our military, God bless them, they made mistakes and followed orders that were wrong, but they're going, look, we're not going to follow Al-Qaeda now, and we're not going to be their air force, and we're not going to train Al-Qaeda to overthrow all these countries.
[00:27:20.705 --> 00:27:23.425]  Egypt, Syria, you name it, we're not going to be part of this.
[00:27:25.646 --> 00:27:30.047]  So now the globalists have moved on to Ukraine for destabilization for all of Eastern Europe.
[00:27:32.264 --> 00:27:39.168]  But Bill Maher comes out, this will get him big brownie points with neocons and conservatives, and has said, Islam is the problem, period.
[00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:48.694]  The issue is that while he's all high and mighty, literally the people he works for, literally sock puppet Al Qaeda.
[00:27:49.675 --> 00:27:54.778]  And that doesn't absolve Saudi Arabia and radical Islam, it's a real group, a real threat.
[00:27:54.998 --> 00:27:55.519]  It's just that
[00:27:59.147 --> 00:28:07.174]  If Al-Qaeda's the horses, the New World Order's the driver, and ride shotguns NATO, on this stagecoach to hell.
[00:28:07.454 --> 00:28:15.301]  So here's a short clip of Bill Maher, you know, acting like he's against the radical Islamic threat, or saying it's all Muslims, period.
[00:28:15.762 --> 00:28:17.523]  This will sell the police state domestically.
[00:28:17.724 --> 00:28:20.286]  They can then take our rights for this shadowy enemy.
[00:28:20.546 --> 00:28:22.388]  And he knows full well what he's doing.
[00:28:23.322 --> 00:28:26.284]  This is like saying that all Muslims are guilty.
[00:28:26.425 --> 00:28:28.106]  I'm not saying that.
[00:28:28.146 --> 00:28:30.168]  You're hearing that, but we're not saying that.
[00:28:30.188 --> 00:28:32.430]  What you're saying is Islam is the problem.
[00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:34.051]  Islam is the problem.
[00:28:34.071 --> 00:28:34.431]  Correct.
[00:28:34.651 --> 00:28:38.475]  All religions are the problem, but especially this one.
[00:28:40.757 --> 00:28:41.537]  Let me stop right there.
[00:28:41.557 --> 00:28:42.738]  You know, I kind of agree with you.
[00:28:42.818 --> 00:28:44.620]  Religion, but not relationships with God.
[00:28:45.882 --> 00:28:47.244]  But you see, everything's a religion.
[00:28:47.685 --> 00:28:49.428]  People that are foodies are obsessed with food.
[00:28:49.468 --> 00:28:51.832]  People that are obsessed with tattoos worship tattoos.
[00:28:51.872 --> 00:28:52.453]  It's their idol.
[00:28:52.714 --> 00:28:53.475]  It's their golden calf.
[00:28:53.515 --> 00:28:53.775]  Fine.
[00:28:54.296 --> 00:28:55.999]  People that worship sex, hedonist.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.141]  That's their religion.
[00:28:58.035 --> 00:29:04.700]  The globalists are anti-human eugenicists that study how to control and dumb down populations to make us the prey class.
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:12.606]  And he has said he's a eugenicist and wants death and wants abortion and thinks humans are crap and wants us dead so the world can be his.
[00:29:13.346 --> 00:29:26.276]  So of course he wants to sit there and push a police state and an invasion and destabilization of Africa while he acts high and mighty just like Michelle Obama bring home our girls when their Secretary of State
[00:29:27.509 --> 00:29:32.871]  Has been protecting this organization for six years, Boko Haram.
[00:29:33.451 --> 00:29:34.792]  That is on record.
[00:29:35.732 --> 00:29:38.413]  It was a controversy five and a half years ago when she did it.
[00:29:38.913 --> 00:29:47.617]  But again, the average American just sees Hillary up there concerned and Michelle concerned, not knowing their front people for the group literally behind this.
[00:29:48.777 --> 00:29:50.618]  Literally behind this.
[00:29:51.988 --> 00:29:55.470]  And they're going to use the Muslim threat, the radical Muslim threat, to make us all slaves.
[00:29:56.091 --> 00:29:56.671]  Well, you know what?
[00:29:56.771 --> 00:29:57.412]  I'm sick of it.
[00:29:57.452 --> 00:29:58.172]  Don't take my rights.
[00:29:58.252 --> 00:29:58.633]  Period.
[00:29:59.193 --> 00:30:00.074]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.574 --> 00:30:02.175]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.096 --> 00:30:05.798]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.972 --> 00:30:13.955]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:30:14.015 --> 00:30:18.157]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:30:18.397 --> 00:30:21.779]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.921]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:30:25.081 --> 00:30:32.406]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:30:32.646 --> 00:30:36.307]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:30:36.547 --> 00:30:40.788]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:30:40.968 --> 00:30:46.889]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:30:46.929 --> 00:30:50.950]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:53.410]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:54.950]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:56.331]  It's time to take action.
[00:30:56.491 --> 00:30:58.131]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:31:10.017 --> 00:31:17.161]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:31:17.281 --> 00:31:19.463]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:31:19.643 --> 00:31:24.828]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:31:25.008 --> 00:31:30.113]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:31:30.253 --> 00:31:33.336]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:31:33.636 --> 00:31:37.539]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:31:37.759 --> 00:31:42.082]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:31:42.142 --> 00:31:52.289]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:31:52.509 --> 00:31:56.872]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[00:31:56.992 --> 00:32:03.436]  The new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:32:03.576 --> 00:32:09.277]  Now available exclusively at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:32:09.478 --> 00:32:12.998]  This is Alex Jones for Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:13.158 --> 00:32:15.079]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[00:32:15.299 --> 00:32:21.280]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[00:32:21.481 --> 00:32:26.482]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[00:32:26.562 --> 00:32:31.263]  The new Infowarslife silver bullet colloidal silver is the answer for you and your family.
[00:32:31.443 --> 00:32:35.964]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[00:32:36.244 --> 00:32:44.626]  The InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[00:32:44.847 --> 00:32:46.787]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[00:32:46.987 --> 00:32:54.129]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver.
[00:32:54.349 --> 00:33:00.897]  Using electrical processes within a base of deionized water for your preparedness storage or your home kitchen.
[00:33:00.997 --> 00:33:09.166]  Purchase your bottle of InfoWarsLife.com Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver today and find other amazing supplements at InfoWarsLife.com
[00:33:31.031 --> 00:33:34.934]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:33:35.475 --> 00:33:36.636]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:36.756 --> 00:33:46.506]  And if you are listening or watching this transmission and taking action, waking others up, you are the resistance.
[00:33:51.199 --> 00:33:52.861]  Little Rammstein bringing us in.
[00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:07.254]  Why does it that German sounds literally like Klingon goblins dancing?
[00:34:12.156 --> 00:34:14.176]  I used to listen to Rammstein, like, in college.
[00:34:14.497 --> 00:34:16.497]  But I was first on the air.
[00:34:17.517 --> 00:34:18.977]  I've been listening to it a lot lately.
[00:34:18.997 --> 00:34:23.718]  It's probably not good for me to listen to it.
[00:34:23.758 --> 00:34:25.759]  Makes me get too happy.
[00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:29.240]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.741]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:34:34.861 --> 00:34:35.801]  until 2 p.m.
[00:34:36.401 --> 00:34:37.942]  Central Standard Time.
[00:34:38.082 --> 00:34:39.902]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are here live.
[00:34:42.028 --> 00:34:48.432]  Back weeknights, seven o'clock central for InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:34:52.395 --> 00:34:54.657]  We've got some really serious news here.
[00:34:54.777 --> 00:34:56.358]  Officials say there's a second U.S.
[00:34:56.398 --> 00:34:58.279]  case of MERS being reported.
[00:34:58.319 --> 00:35:01.842]  This thing kills a lot of the people that come in contact with it.
[00:35:01.922 --> 00:35:04.784]  AP reports health officials have confirmed a second
[00:35:05.603 --> 00:35:05.883]  U.S.
[00:35:05.943 --> 00:35:09.445]  case of a mysterious virus that has sickened hundreds in the Middle East.
[00:35:09.885 --> 00:35:10.926]  Well, it's killed a lot of people.
[00:35:11.646 --> 00:35:18.090]  A news conference to discuss the case has been scheduled for later today by the Florida Department of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
[00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:21.932]  The virus is MERS, or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.
[00:35:21.952 --> 00:35:28.656]  It is a respiratory illness that begins with flu-like fever, a cough that can lead to shortness of breath, pneumonia, and death.
[00:35:29.216 --> 00:35:31.958]  A third of those who develop symptoms die from it.
[00:35:32.078 --> 00:35:32.478]  You hear that?
[00:35:33.646 --> 00:35:36.248]  That means if your family gets it, four or five people, two of you are dead.
[00:35:36.288 --> 00:35:37.709]  It's not a good situation.
[00:35:38.209 --> 00:35:40.331]  Most cases have been seen in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East.
[00:35:40.791 --> 00:35:42.873]  Earlier this month, a first U.S.
[00:35:42.913 --> 00:35:47.716]  case was diagnosed in a man who traveled from Saudi Arabia to the U.S.
[00:35:47.756 --> 00:35:48.877]  So let's just stop right there.
[00:35:50.178 --> 00:35:52.620]  But they're not checking for people coming from Saudi Arabia.
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:59.785]  They get to bypass homeland security because the Saudi king doesn't like his people being grubbed on or x-rayed.
[00:36:00.748 --> 00:36:03.691]  Their women don't have to take their headdresses off, but your wife?
[00:36:04.611 --> 00:36:08.014]  Your wife's going to get groped by a lady that looks like Janet Reno.
[00:36:09.075 --> 00:36:12.979]  Because you've got to be nudged and broken and taught to be a good slave.
[00:36:14.656 --> 00:36:16.597]  Now, let's continue here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:16.617 --> 00:36:17.857]  I'll give you this whole Bill Marklip.
[00:36:18.377 --> 00:36:21.519]  You can do a search, Boko Haram, CIA.
[00:36:22.119 --> 00:36:24.020]  Boko Haram, Al Qaeda.
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.461]  Boko Haram, Hillary Clinton.
[00:36:26.881 --> 00:36:30.642]  And you will get the fact that Boko Haram is Western funded.
[00:36:31.202 --> 00:36:32.343]  It's beyond CIA.
[00:36:33.003 --> 00:36:35.964]  Mercenary, globalist funded, because they want to destabilize Africa.
[00:36:36.144 --> 00:36:37.965]  Here's the Daily Beast, that's the Democrats.
[00:36:40.043 --> 00:36:40.884]  What is that, Newsweek?
[00:36:41.364 --> 00:36:43.465]  Boko Haram's Bin Laden connection.
[00:36:44.026 --> 00:36:52.491]  Some intelligence analysts believe that Osama Bin Laden provided everything from seed money to strategic direction to the now infamous Nigerian terror group.
[00:36:53.152 --> 00:37:05.620]  Well, yeah, he's the cutout for the CIA, for MI6, on record, for Saudi intelligence, on record, on record, on record, on record.
[00:37:07.701 --> 00:37:09.363]  And now they put Al Qaeda in control.
[00:37:10.566 --> 00:37:24.874]  In Libya, right in the middle of North Africa, to invade Nigeria, right down to Central Africa, right into the Congo, I mean, right into the Gold Coast, right into the Ivory Coast.
[00:37:24.914 --> 00:37:26.135]  I mean, it is just Al-Qaeda.
[00:37:27.035 --> 00:37:30.497]  Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda.
[00:37:30.777 --> 00:37:35.300]  They are hitting all over Africa, but don't worry, here comes the army!
[00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:36.600]  Here comes the bugle.
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:37.281]  Can we find a...
[00:37:38.487 --> 00:37:41.548]  Army Cavalry Bugle calling in the infantry.
[00:37:41.568 --> 00:37:45.149]  What's the actual technical name of calling in the infantry?
[00:37:45.169 --> 00:37:47.729]  No, that's not the infantry, the cavalry.
[00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:51.350]  I want to hear the Cavalry Bugle.
[00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:54.711]  It's when the infantry calls in the Cavalry Bugle.
[00:37:54.731 --> 00:37:56.872]  In the old westerns, that's really what they did.
[00:37:57.847 --> 00:38:04.210]  They still did it even up into Vietnam when the helicopters would come in to assist ground troops in a battle.
[00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:06.891]  They would blow the bugle and sometimes have it on the loudspeakers.
[00:38:07.451 --> 00:38:09.552]  That's accurate when I do that in Apocalypse Now.
[00:38:11.012 --> 00:38:14.854]  So, here comes the Army, here comes NORTHCOM, here comes the Marines.
[00:38:15.134 --> 00:38:22.777]  From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli, we will fight George Soros' battles.
[00:38:25.638 --> 00:38:27.159]  Al Qaeda's blowing everything up!
[00:38:27.439 --> 00:38:28.960]  Boko Haram kidnapped women!
[00:38:29.521 --> 00:38:30.241]  What do we do?
[00:38:30.741 --> 00:38:32.863]  You call in the Big Red One and the Army!
[00:38:33.203 --> 00:38:34.164]  Here come the drones!
[00:38:35.168 --> 00:38:36.629]  What does the head of the Pentagon say?
[00:38:37.449 --> 00:38:39.170]  What does the Army Secretary say?
[00:38:39.851 --> 00:38:41.391]  It's time to drone everything!
[00:38:41.812 --> 00:38:42.732]  Drones are sexy.
[00:38:42.752 --> 00:38:43.573]  Drones are good.
[00:38:43.893 --> 00:38:46.754]  Well, we'll probably get Michelle Obama and Jay-Z to call for it.
[00:38:47.375 --> 00:38:48.776]  Bomb anybody and everybody.
[00:38:48.876 --> 00:38:49.476]  Kill everybody.
[00:38:49.796 --> 00:38:52.137]  Line up villagers, Christian, Muslim, animist.
[00:38:52.518 --> 00:38:52.998]  Murder them.
[00:38:53.038 --> 00:38:53.858]  Take their gold.
[00:38:54.119 --> 00:38:54.919]  Take their timber.
[00:38:54.979 --> 00:38:55.840]  Make them slaves.
[00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.300]  Put them in slave pits.
[00:38:57.701 --> 00:38:59.962]  It doesn't matter, because there was a Muslim
[00:39:00.362 --> 00:39:13.191]  Boca, Haram, and Michelle, the most beautiful snapping turtle in North America, why, she came out, ladies and gentlemen, and she said, bring our girls home.
[00:39:14.512 --> 00:39:17.334]  Even though Hillary runs the whole operation and the White House is behind it.
[00:39:17.354 --> 00:39:22.538]  In fact, can we hear that bugle one more time, calling in the cavalry?
[00:39:24.179 --> 00:39:29.723]  I mean, this is important, that all of Africa be invaded, just like we told you six years ago in Obama deception.
[00:39:32.608 --> 00:39:37.332]  And the army will actually believe, when they're there, they're fighting Al-Qaeda.
[00:39:38.653 --> 00:39:40.555]  But when they get there, they'll be killing Christians, mainly.
[00:39:42.096 --> 00:39:46.920]  Now, because the average person doesn't know who these countries are, doesn't know who these people are, they don't know what's going on.
[00:39:48.201 --> 00:39:51.644]  So, oh, Bin Laden funding Boko Haram!
[00:39:52.385 --> 00:39:57.009]  Oh, Hillary Clinton protested designation of Boko Haram as a terrorist group.
[00:39:57.389 --> 00:40:00.732]  That was before they got all their weapons and launched their offensive to destabilize the region.
[00:40:01.869 --> 00:40:04.793]  Now they won't be bombed or killed, they'll be left alone.
[00:40:05.213 --> 00:40:08.637]  Or maybe they'll stage the death of this Hollywood actor they've got as the leader of it.
[00:40:08.657 --> 00:40:13.343]  In fact, can we get the video, the now famous Boca Haram video of the leader of it?
[00:40:13.864 --> 00:40:18.670]  Saying, we want your women, we will kidnap them, we will sell them, we will make the Christians convert to Islam.
[00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:27.777]  Because Islam is about murdering women, Islam is about enslaving women, Islam is about controlling them and selling them and making them slaves.
[00:40:27.837 --> 00:40:29.859]  I mean, no one talks like that.
[00:40:30.119 --> 00:40:31.580]  And I'm not defending radical Islam.
[00:40:31.941 --> 00:40:34.222]  The point is, it's central casting.
[00:40:35.123 --> 00:40:40.805]  The son of the former head of the ADL, Adam Gadahn, who was arrested beating up Muslims repeatedly in California.
[00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:46.147]  He hated them so much, he would go outside mosques as a teenager, listening to heavy metal, and beat them up.
[00:40:46.727 --> 00:40:48.688]  And then they said, hey, you really want to fight the Muslims?
[00:40:48.728 --> 00:40:52.749]  Become them, demonize them, clash of civilizations, my boy.
[00:40:53.409 --> 00:40:55.450]  You don't beat them up outside their mosque.
[00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:57.891]  You lead them to blow stuff up.
[00:41:02.288 --> 00:41:04.290]  Ah, isn't that just perfect?
[00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:07.592]  If you guys are looking for the Boca Haram video, I saw you had it last Friday.
[00:41:07.932 --> 00:41:09.773]  There's another one, it's all over the news.
[00:41:10.474 --> 00:41:18.840]  I mean, you just type in Boca Haram video, it is universal, everywhere, every channel, total push for total invasion.
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:31.048]  They're there saying, get me, get me, I'm evil, I hurt women, I sexually mutilate them, we're gonna grab your daughters, we're gonna make them convert, ah ha ha, we're gonna kill your daughters, literally out of central casting.
[00:41:33.789 --> 00:41:35.150]  It's kind of like the Hatari militia.
[00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:38.733]  I saw a video with the guy in camo with two guards behind him.
[00:41:38.773 --> 00:41:40.935]  It looked totally fake, the way a dictator would act.
[00:41:40.995 --> 00:41:41.836]  And I said, that's fake.
[00:41:42.056 --> 00:41:43.117]  That group's federal run.
[00:41:43.337 --> 00:41:46.480]  They're going to shut down that group out of 800-plus militia groups we know of.
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:47.541]  There's more than that.
[00:41:47.961 --> 00:41:48.902]  That group's fed run.
[00:41:48.942 --> 00:41:49.503]  Turned out it was.
[00:41:49.723 --> 00:41:50.143]  I was correct.
[00:41:50.183 --> 00:41:50.644]  It was all true.
[00:41:50.864 --> 00:41:52.866]  Because I can see fake video.
[00:41:55.009 --> 00:41:56.690]  I can see fake video.
[00:41:56.850 --> 00:42:00.052]  I know fake video when I see it.
[00:42:00.453 --> 00:42:04.375]  And we're going to be going over that video for you.
[00:42:05.756 --> 00:42:06.857]  But here are the headlines.
[00:42:07.257 --> 00:42:09.699]  Who are Nigeria's Boko Haram Islamicists?
[00:42:10.159 --> 00:42:15.483]  Boko Haram, an Islamicist group, active since 2009, since Obama got elected.
[00:42:15.923 --> 00:42:16.423]  You notice that?
[00:42:17.124 --> 00:42:18.365]  Part of the Nigeria program.
[00:42:19.365 --> 00:42:22.568]  Boko Haram offers to swap kidnapped Nigerian girls for prisoners.
[00:42:23.604 --> 00:42:24.764]  Nigerian abducted girls.
[00:42:24.784 --> 00:42:27.445]  Boko Haram leader claims captives converted to Islam.
[00:42:28.406 --> 00:42:29.206]  CIA director.
[00:42:29.286 --> 00:42:29.506]  U.S.
[00:42:29.526 --> 00:42:32.407]  doing everything we can to find Nigerian kidnapped girls.
[00:42:32.767 --> 00:42:36.269]  Oh, the CIA is going to save the girls.
[00:42:36.669 --> 00:42:38.830]  Because when one person dies, it's a tragedy.
[00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:40.390]  10,000 dies is a statistic.
[00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:42.871]  Drones and the CIA are so sexy.
[00:42:42.891 --> 00:42:43.731]  They're the good guys.
[00:42:44.131 --> 00:42:45.172]  Like Captain America.
[00:42:46.567 --> 00:42:48.668]  And then it just goes on from there.
[00:42:48.768 --> 00:43:05.719]  So, we're going to go ahead and go to about five minutes of this clip of the Savior, Bill Maher, and he loves Obama, and they're fighting against radicalism, and thank God Obama is doing everything he can to fight the group they've been funding and running, and just like Al-Qaeda and Benghazi.
[00:43:05.779 --> 00:43:07.420]  I mean, it's so good of him.
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:12.743]  See, this gets the heat off of them for openly.
[00:43:14.244 --> 00:43:15.445]  This gets the heat off of them
[00:43:16.906 --> 00:43:18.787]  For openly running Al-Qaeda.
[00:43:18.827 --> 00:43:21.568]  The globalists are concerned that this is coming out, that the military knows about it.
[00:43:21.608 --> 00:43:30.171]  So, oh look, here's a Muslim threat, here's why we've got to invade Africa, and Obama can get up and beat his chest, and Hillary can, and say, see, I'm fighting Boko Haram!
[00:43:30.531 --> 00:43:33.532]  Which she said, don't put on a terrorist list, so we can give them money.
[00:43:36.033 --> 00:43:40.135]  And don't put the new Al-Qaeda groups, al-Nusra, on the, because we want to give them money.
[00:43:40.155 --> 00:43:41.275]  I mean, it's all there.
[00:43:41.736 --> 00:43:45.337]  It's hiding in plain view, because they know the general public can't find Nigeria.
[00:43:47.244 --> 00:43:48.424]  With both eyeballs and a map.
[00:43:49.945 --> 00:43:52.545]  I mean, I go out and talk to the general public, folks, they can't find Australia.
[00:43:53.825 --> 00:43:55.826]  They've done TV shows, people can't find Australia.
[00:43:57.086 --> 00:44:00.627]  Or you put Al-Qaeda stand on it, and Americans will say, yeah, blow that up.
[00:44:01.047 --> 00:44:01.907]  That's where Al-Qaeda is.
[00:44:02.107 --> 00:44:04.587]  They don't know where the Middle East is, folks, it doesn't have names on it.
[00:44:06.588 --> 00:44:10.148]  And so the globalists that have hijacked this country run radical Islam.
[00:44:10.308 --> 00:44:12.249]  And I want to be clear, I'm not saying it isn't a threat.
[00:44:12.449 --> 00:44:13.329]  It's a serious threat.
[00:44:15.282 --> 00:44:19.005]  Iran has come out today and said, quote, you know, we've defeated the U.S.
[00:44:19.065 --> 00:44:23.329]  and NATO with Russia in Syria, but you've got a big problem.
[00:44:23.769 --> 00:44:28.433]  They came out and said radical Wahhabis are not going to attack Europe, and don't you dare blame us.
[00:44:29.054 --> 00:44:30.054]  See, Iran gets it.
[00:44:30.235 --> 00:44:35.319]  And I'm not romanticizing Iran, but they're archenemies with Al Qaeda, and they understand the plan.
[00:44:35.819 --> 00:44:38.962]  So they're saying, don't blow stuff up with Stinger missiles and blame us.
[00:44:39.262 --> 00:44:40.723]  We're not going to be attacking you.
[00:44:41.044 --> 00:44:41.944]  Do not attack us.
[00:44:42.972 --> 00:44:47.316]  And we know your plan is to turn everything over to Al Qaeda, and we're against Al Qaeda.
[00:44:47.516 --> 00:44:49.638]  They're arch-enemies with Al Qaeda.
[00:44:51.379 --> 00:44:53.261]  Folks, I don't like what the Mullahs are doing in Iran.
[00:44:53.421 --> 00:44:54.262]  I hate Al Qaeda.
[00:44:56.483 --> 00:44:59.806]  But again, the Mullahs are CIA-connected back in the 70s as well.
[00:45:00.066 --> 00:45:01.268]  It's all a double-triple game.
[00:45:01.708 --> 00:45:07.573]  Now let's go to this clip of Bill Maher playing the part of the Savior, saying something that will make him real popular.
[00:45:09.278 --> 00:45:10.780]  This is political correctness, folks.
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:13.303]  Run Al-Qaeda while you claim you're fighting it.
[00:45:13.863 --> 00:45:14.404]  Here's Bill Maher.
[00:45:14.744 --> 00:45:23.975]  Let's move to the thing you kind of raised before, which is the Muslim question, because it was in the news this week, big time, with Boko Haram.
[00:45:24.415 --> 00:45:25.757]  I guess I'm pronouncing that right.
[00:45:25.797 --> 00:45:29.882]  They're the people who sell, they abducted all these girls in Nigeria.
[00:45:30.362 --> 00:45:31.504]  And they want to sell them.
[00:45:31.544 --> 00:45:33.066]  Let me read the quote from the leader.
[00:45:33.106 --> 00:45:34.588]  He said, I abducted your girls.
[00:45:34.708 --> 00:45:36.591]  I will sell them in the market by Allah.
[00:45:36.932 --> 00:45:38.594]  There is a market for selling humans.
[00:45:38.714 --> 00:45:39.976]  Allah says I should sell them.
[00:45:40.276 --> 00:45:41.538]  He commands me to sell them.
[00:45:41.638 --> 00:45:42.520]  I will sell women.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:43.321]  I sell women.
[00:45:45.404 --> 00:45:47.225]  I think this man says he wants to sell women.
[00:45:47.525 --> 00:45:49.446]  I'm getting that from him.
[00:45:49.466 --> 00:45:53.988]  And I've heard people say that this is evil, which we would all agree, a cancer.
[00:45:54.128 --> 00:46:00.291]  Obama's statement was, we have not extinguished mankind's darkest impulses.
[00:46:00.911 --> 00:46:08.775]  There's no mention here of connectedness to the religion, which is always what I am seeking to do, because I think that's the elephant in the room.
[00:46:09.155 --> 00:46:13.237]  And that in the religion at large, women are seen as property.
[00:46:13.917 --> 00:46:17.540]  Second class at best, often as property.
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:20.743]  Shouldn't that be brought to light in this debate as well?
[00:46:20.943 --> 00:46:22.804]  Don't you think it is being known?
[00:46:22.984 --> 00:46:23.705]  I don't.
[00:46:23.745 --> 00:46:32.652]  When I read about this horrifying group, and they're saying Allah Akbar, I mean they're saying God is great, let's snatch this 13 year old and sell her or kill her.
[00:46:32.892 --> 00:46:35.795]  It is so, it's beyond comprehension how evil this is.
[00:46:35.815 --> 00:46:40.839]  But when I see it described, I see it described as a radical sectarian or Islamic terrorist group.
[00:46:40.859 --> 00:46:42.520]  You do realize this is Global Trump?
[00:46:43.841 --> 00:46:48.065]  I think the point that Bill is making is that it's not just radical sectarian groups.
[00:46:48.125 --> 00:46:49.106]  That's right.
[00:46:49.187 --> 00:46:50.268]  It's not just an outrage.
[00:46:50.308 --> 00:46:51.048]  I'm here to interpret.
[00:46:51.068 --> 00:46:52.410]  It's not a few bad apples.
[00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:53.371]  That's a good translation.
[00:46:53.391 --> 00:46:55.753]  Thank you.
[00:46:56.293 --> 00:46:58.516]  This is the few bad apples argument.
[00:46:58.936 --> 00:47:00.177]  I think it's a few bad arguments.
[00:47:00.217 --> 00:47:03.980]  I think you have to have a clear eye at what's happening in the world around you.
[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:12.007]  And Islam, as one of the great major religions, is providing a disproportionate share of radical nutbags killing people right now.
[00:47:12.067 --> 00:47:14.329]  That's just, I think, happening right now.
[00:47:14.649 --> 00:47:17.512]  Saudi Arabian intelligence is working with the West.
[00:47:18.012 --> 00:47:21.074]  Turkey, even again in the BBC, they had to admit what we and others broke.
[00:47:21.134 --> 00:47:23.095]  Turkey has been caught launching false flag attacks.
[00:47:40.845 --> 00:47:43.646]  With the President and the Defense Minister on the phone planning them.
[00:47:43.966 --> 00:47:45.506]  The Russians have been capturing all that.
[00:47:46.006 --> 00:47:46.907]  They don't deny the U.S.
[00:47:46.967 --> 00:47:51.788]  Ambassador, you know, on the phone with one of the top State Department people how to stage stuff.
[00:47:51.808 --> 00:47:53.689]  I mean, this is what they're doing.
[00:47:55.129 --> 00:47:56.229]  And it's for you.
[00:47:56.669 --> 00:47:59.710]  The armored vehicles, the checkpoints, it's for the Tea Party and gun owners.
[00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:03.671]  And that's why the left is supporting all this, because this is their takeover.
[00:48:04.131 --> 00:48:05.772]  And when you wake up, it's all for you.
[00:48:07.537 --> 00:48:11.139]  The combat robots, all of it, and all the training has nothing to do with Islam.
[00:48:11.359 --> 00:48:16.301]  That's why if you criticize radical Islam in any way, you're banned from universities, you're banned from speaking.
[00:48:17.842 --> 00:48:21.984]  In fact, I've got an article here now, it's official, from Harvard.
[00:48:22.784 --> 00:48:23.744]  This is from Harvard.
[00:48:25.665 --> 00:48:31.668]  All you can eat taco bars deemed offensive face campus extinction.
[00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:41.921]  Well, I mean, you're supposed to have a Greek thing, uh, you can have a, uh, Polynesian-style party at the pool, a taco bar, fish tacos, has nothing to do with putting down Hispanics.
[00:48:42.281 --> 00:48:45.204]  But the local La Raza La Reconquista says, basically,
[00:48:46.544 --> 00:48:47.225]  There's a monopoly.
[00:48:47.265 --> 00:48:49.728]  Unless it's Hispanic run, you can't serve tacos.
[00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:54.695]  So any Mexican food restaurants owned by anybody that's not Hispanic need to be shut down.
[00:48:55.016 --> 00:49:01.084]  And Fiesta Texas, if it's not owned, if Six Flags is not owned by Hispanics only, I want Six Flags shut down.
[00:49:01.104 --> 00:49:02.406]  It's got a Mexican flag on it.
[00:49:03.027 --> 00:49:04.868]  This is the ultimate political correctness.
[00:49:05.129 --> 00:49:07.611]  You can fund Al-Qaeda to sexually mutilate women.
[00:49:08.131 --> 00:49:12.995]  You can fund Al-Qaeda to launch all these wars and kill 300,000 people in Syria, at least.
[00:49:13.015 --> 00:49:13.675]  That's the new numbers.
[00:49:14.296 --> 00:49:17.638]  You can do all this evil, kill 40,000 blacks in Libya, Al-Qaeda.
[00:49:18.178 --> 00:49:19.339]  That's wonderful and good.
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:23.142]  But you say, hey, let's have a fiesta and all get drunk.
[00:49:24.343 --> 00:49:25.904]  Believe me, I've been to fiesta parties in college.
[00:49:25.924 --> 00:49:27.405]  It has nothing to do with putting down Mexicans.
[00:49:27.726 --> 00:49:29.407]  There's a bunch of Mexicans there having a great time.
[00:49:31.957 --> 00:49:39.021]  I mean, I go to parties sometime downtown and there'll be a bunch of mainly Hispanics, you know, with their friends, black, white, you name it, having a fiesta party.
[00:49:39.621 --> 00:49:41.382]  Everybody's wearing little sombreros, getting drunk.
[00:49:42.042 --> 00:49:44.063]  It had nothing to do with putting down Mexicans, folks.
[00:49:45.344 --> 00:49:47.645]  All over the Southwest, it is a Mexican culture.
[00:49:47.665 --> 00:49:48.766]  Let me scare everybody with a newsflash.
[00:49:50.427 --> 00:49:52.227]  Everybody's been native here since it began.
[00:49:52.247 --> 00:49:56.009]  That's what cowboy hats and chaps and leather belts and all of it is.
[00:49:56.029 --> 00:49:57.010]  I mean, it's ridiculous!
[00:49:57.830 --> 00:49:59.071]  It's absolutely out of control.
[00:49:59.291 --> 00:50:00.712]  My cousin grew up in Guatemala.
[00:50:02.705 --> 00:50:04.846]  Does that mean he can't speak Spanish because he's white?
[00:50:05.126 --> 00:50:09.507]  This is pure bull, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:09.527 --> 00:50:10.787]  This is political correctness.
[00:50:10.807 --> 00:50:13.128]  This is the control of the language.
[00:50:13.588 --> 00:50:23.530]  So I'm going to send my reporters out to Taco Bell, which isn't Mexican food to begin with, but it's like corporate poison, and have them say, hey, should this be shut down as racist?
[00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:26.051]  Because, you know, they're serving tacos in there.
[00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:31.862]  Yeah, is it evil I'm even playing mariachi music?
[00:50:32.643 --> 00:50:37.907]  Is it evil I go to a Mexican food restaurant and pay the mariachi band to come over and play Roo-Koo-Koo to me because I like it?
[00:50:39.368 --> 00:50:39.608]  Is it?
[00:50:40.469 --> 00:50:49.677]  This is about making us all feel guilty when we're not racist and we're not bad while the real globalist control goes on and they sterilize Hispanic girls with Gardasil shots in Mexico.
[00:50:51.516 --> 00:50:54.218]  It's a New World Order takeover, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:55.158 --> 00:50:56.359]  Am I racist against Germans?
[00:50:56.559 --> 00:50:58.541]  Because I came in and said I like the way German sounds?
[00:50:58.941 --> 00:50:59.321]  RUM.
[00:50:59.341 --> 00:51:00.142]  STEIN.
[00:51:00.162 --> 00:51:04.184]  We're going to come back and play some of the Boko Haram group.
[00:51:05.005 --> 00:51:08.687]  Must mean I'm anti-African because I don't like the CIA Boko Haram murdering women.
[00:51:08.808 --> 00:51:09.228]  Racist!
[00:51:10.373 --> 00:51:15.297]  Gentlemen, in search of a million-dollar smile that'll make them take notice, I mean really get their attention?
[00:51:15.677 --> 00:51:16.598]  Then get the mud!
[00:51:17.019 --> 00:51:17.999]  My Magic Mud!
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:22.963]  The fluoride-free whitener with no chemicals, additives, GMOs, or bad taste.
[00:51:23.384 --> 00:51:24.345]  And safe to swallow.
[00:51:24.805 --> 00:51:30.390]  My Magic Mud detoxifies, reduces sensitivity, cleans and strengthens your teeth while it whitens.
[00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:33.232]  Comes as a powder for pure whitening power.
[00:51:33.612 --> 00:51:35.614]  Start looking good for that special someone.
[00:51:35.994 --> 00:51:37.035]  Get the mud now!
[00:51:37.415 --> 00:51:38.576]  MyMagicMud.com
[00:51:39.457 --> 00:51:48.723]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:51:48.783 --> 00:51:49.503]  This capitalism?
[00:51:49.563 --> 00:51:55.687]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:51:55.727 --> 00:51:59.369]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:51:59.429 --> 00:52:00.350]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:01.410]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:01.690]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:52:01.751 --> 00:52:02.091]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:52:13.436 --> 00:52:15.076]  Curious about what comes next?
[00:52:15.856 --> 00:52:22.058]  Next is the feeling of vulnerability you get after you arrive home to discover your house has been ransacked by burglars.
[00:52:22.538 --> 00:52:25.578]  Fool the bad guys with a new improved fake TV.
[00:52:25.918 --> 00:52:32.179]  You asked for it, we listened, and we made our new fake TV three times brighter than our previous model.
[00:52:32.399 --> 00:52:36.000]  The brightness of our new fake TV is equivalent to a 40-inch TV.
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:41.221]  It simulates the color and motion of a real TV while you're away from home.
[00:52:41.801 --> 00:52:47.903]  And when burglars think someone is home watching television, they're likely to pass your house and move on to an easier target.
[00:52:48.264 --> 00:52:52.685]  The new, brighter Fake TV is only $39.95 and includes free shipping.
[00:52:53.065 --> 00:52:55.666]  Go to Faketv.com or call 1-877-5-Fake-TV.
[00:52:55.686 --> 00:52:56.146]  That's 877-532-5388.
[00:52:56.166 --> 00:52:57.187]  Or go to Faketv.com.
[00:52:57.367 --> 00:52:57.827]  Fake TV.
[00:52:57.867 --> 00:52:59.308]  The burglar deterrent.
[00:53:08.954 --> 00:53:13.315]  I'm sick of how the big drug companies are keeping men from fixing their ED without pills.
[00:53:13.635 --> 00:53:20.076]  Matt Cook here from GetEDSolutions.com, and I've helped thousands of men fully recover from ED without pills, pumps, or supplements.
[00:53:20.156 --> 00:53:24.197]  But the big drug companies collect $5 billion in revenue from sales of ED medications.
[00:53:24.397 --> 00:53:25.718]  They don't want my message to get out.
[00:53:25.798 --> 00:53:26.978]  Things are so much better now.
[00:53:27.358 --> 00:53:29.518]  Everything kinda came back overnight.
[00:53:29.698 --> 00:53:32.099]  My girlfriend is very happy.
[00:53:32.259 --> 00:53:35.562]  I purchased your product yesterday and it was fantastic.
[00:53:35.723 --> 00:53:39.006]  I have used your system for about three weeks and I'm already seeing great results.
[00:53:39.246 --> 00:53:50.137]  If you're one of the 52% of men who suffer ED, you must go to my website at GetEDSolutions.com and watch an instant web class that shows you how to get rid of your ED forever from the privacy of your own home.
[00:53:50.278 --> 00:53:54.522]  That's GetEDSolutions.com for an eye-opening web class you can watch instantly.
[00:53:54.622 --> 00:54:04.014]  You'll never be the same, and your wife or girlfriend will thank you because you were smart enough not to just believe the big drug companies, but to find out the truth about ED at GetEDSolutions.com.
[00:54:04.194 --> 00:54:06.056]  That's GetEDSolutions.com.
[00:54:06.176 --> 00:54:07.638]  GetEDSolutions.com.
[00:54:30.074 --> 00:54:35.237]  Ladies and gentlemen, consciousness, life is a great gift, and I am so honored to be here with you today.
[00:54:35.917 --> 00:54:36.477]  I am humbled.
[00:54:37.538 --> 00:54:41.060]  Facing up against this great evil, I act like a maniac, because I am a maniac.
[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:53.006]  You know, it takes a maniac to be willing to go up against the globalist maniacs, and that's why I have been successful and resonated with a lot of people, despite all the rough edges.
[00:54:54.126 --> 00:54:58.949]  Because it really came to me last week that my one attribute is that I'm a straight shooter.
[00:55:00.117 --> 00:55:04.598]  My one attribute is I tell the truth even when the truth makes me look bad.
[00:55:05.779 --> 00:55:08.019]  Sometimes I'm so honest with people I just can't believe it.
[00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:16.842]  And I lied more when I was a child than when I was a teenager, but I really came to the realization that I don't lie.
[00:55:18.703 --> 00:55:20.423]  And I'm one of the most truthful people I know.
[00:55:21.724 --> 00:55:24.064]  And I'm not bragging about that.
[00:55:24.484 --> 00:55:25.925]  I'm just being honest that
[00:55:27.577 --> 00:55:28.578]  No brag, just fact.
[00:55:28.618 --> 00:55:29.579]  I forget who said that.
[00:55:30.299 --> 00:55:35.783]  That that is something that isn't very common now in society, and that that's the true value.
[00:55:37.024 --> 00:55:42.309]  And that's why the system always tries to say I'm a liar, or a deceiver, or take my mistakes and claim it was on purpose.
[00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:50.235]  Is so they can twist things and make you not believe that there's good people out there, because you're good as well.
[00:55:51.610 --> 00:55:53.371]  They know there's good men out there.
[00:55:54.211 --> 00:55:55.852]  They know there's good women out there.
[00:55:56.353 --> 00:56:01.596]  They know there's people of conscience and passion who desire justice.
[00:56:03.717 --> 00:56:04.577]  And they're afraid of you.
[00:56:06.098 --> 00:56:09.980]  And the battle for civilization and humanity is fought in each and every one of our hearts.
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:12.321]  I always heard that growing up, didn't really understand it.
[00:56:12.642 --> 00:56:18.705]  But it's true, if we all are just moral people, if we all are upstanding people, if we all try to be good people,
[00:56:20.885 --> 00:56:22.486]  And work hard, and have faith.
[00:56:24.227 --> 00:56:25.267]  We can change the world.
[00:56:27.488 --> 00:56:35.512]  But if Madison Avenue can make us feel inadequate, weak, pathetic, and confuse us, they can get us and program us, and we've got to change that.
[00:56:35.813 --> 00:56:44.137]  I've got a clip of the Boko Haram leader, in what looks like a completely scripted video, who's been State Department, you know, supported by Hillary Clinton, basically.
[00:56:45.707 --> 00:56:47.149]  Who's now milking this?
[00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:56.257]  Here's a little bit of this video, and if you're watching, radio listeners have already seen it, and here's the audio, but this looks to me like it's staged and scripted.
[00:56:56.617 --> 00:56:58.859]  And then you go look it up, and the CIA's been connected to them.
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:00.961]  It's very sick.
[00:57:01.101 --> 00:57:01.521]  Here's the clip.
[00:57:08.735 --> 00:57:10.376]  That guy may not be an actor.
[00:57:10.396 --> 00:57:10.936]  He probably is.
[00:57:10.956 --> 00:57:13.116]  I believe he's a mentally ill egomaniac.
[00:57:31.934 --> 00:57:33.936]  By the way, of course they've converted.
[00:57:33.956 --> 00:57:35.237]  It's Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:57:35.297 --> 00:57:36.438]  It's like kidnappers.
[00:57:36.999 --> 00:57:44.145]  People then serve to try to get out of it.
[00:57:44.565 --> 00:57:45.746]  And that's enough.
[00:57:45.786 --> 00:57:47.128]  We'll come back to more over the next hour.
[00:57:47.348 --> 00:57:54.294]  But what I want to get to here is that he says in there, they've converted, but I might kill them or sell them.
[00:57:54.654 --> 00:57:58.958]  So these are precious Muslims, and you're saying you might kill them or sell them.
[00:58:03.288 --> 00:58:05.589]  I mean, you couldn't write worse PR for, quote, Islam.
[00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:11.072]  So did they get this guy out of Central Casting, or did they find the most radical nutjob they could to put him in power?
[00:58:11.092 --> 00:58:17.855]  I mean, the guy clearly has the narcissistic look of most of the yuppies I see down on 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th Street downtown.
[00:58:17.915 --> 00:58:20.916]  He has that crazed power trip look in his eye.
[00:58:22.116 --> 00:58:24.277]  That's more of a, he's scared, so he's just trying to act tough.
[00:58:25.258 --> 00:58:27.359]  But if you back it up, he has this narcissist look where he's like,
[00:58:28.274 --> 00:58:29.394]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:53.651 --> 00:58:55.635]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[00:58:59.995 --> 00:59:07.821]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:59:08.121 --> 00:59:10.202]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:59:10.343 --> 00:59:12.984]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:59:13.044 --> 00:59:17.167]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment, and pushes Obamacare.
[00:59:17.468 --> 00:59:20.610]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:27.915]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:59:28.075 --> 00:59:32.217]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:59:32.398 --> 00:59:34.099]  We are the true media.
[00:59:34.179 --> 00:59:36.800]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:40.522]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.

[00:59:52.609 --> 00:59:54.352]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:14.537 --> 01:00:15.178]  Big Brother.
[01:00:15.858 --> 01:00:16.879]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:18.741]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:19.381 --> 01:00:20.182]  You want answers?
[01:00:20.963 --> 01:00:21.864]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:22.524 --> 01:00:26.147]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:26.708 --> 01:00:30.752]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.792 --> 01:00:37.836]  All right, folks, if you just joined us, Dr. Steve Patino is going to be with us until about 45 after.
[01:00:38.716 --> 01:00:53.189]  Then I want to open the phones up to talk about Boko Haram and the fact that even the Daily Beast admits it's connected to Al-Qaeda, it's globalist run, and that Hillary Clinton's been protecting the group for six years so they could build them up since they got founded in 2009.
[01:00:53.289 --> 01:00:58.313]  I mean, this is so incredibly obvious what's going on.
[01:00:58.373 --> 01:00:59.094]  It's amazing.
[01:01:00.518 --> 01:01:02.239]  So I'll get Pchenik's take on that.
[01:01:02.279 --> 01:01:05.920]  We'll see if he weasels on it or if he's... I know he's listening.
[01:01:06.521 --> 01:01:08.081]  Or if he gives us his real take on it.
[01:01:09.202 --> 01:01:11.142]  But that's coming up in a lot of other issues.
[01:01:11.182 --> 01:01:12.263]  The Russia situation.
[01:01:12.803 --> 01:01:13.804]  His new book that's coming out.
[01:01:13.844 --> 01:01:14.624]  That's all coming up.
[01:01:17.685 --> 01:01:22.567]  But let's play more from the start with the Boko Haram statement of their leader.
[01:01:24.730 --> 01:01:25.690]  Mr. CIA.
[01:01:26.431 --> 01:01:31.233]  Let's go ahead and play the rest of that clip that I started playing in the last segment.
[01:01:32.273 --> 01:01:37.495]  It is now four years or five years that you arrested our brethren and they are still in your prison.
[01:01:38.275 --> 01:01:42.457]  You are doing many things to them.
[01:01:44.558 --> 01:01:46.139]  And now you're talking about these girls?
[01:01:46.879 --> 01:01:50.180]  We will never release them until after you release our brethren.
[01:01:58.373 --> 01:01:59.374]  Is this public school?
[01:02:00.634 --> 01:02:01.475]  We love Obama.
[01:02:04.557 --> 01:02:10.340]  Yeah, there's a full clip, guys, that they've been playing on the news, where he talks about we're gonna kill these women or we'll sell them.
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:12.221]  And that's the clip I want.
[01:02:13.882 --> 01:02:14.863]  It's just everywhere.
[01:02:14.903 --> 01:02:15.643]  It's ubiquitous.
[01:02:16.644 --> 01:02:18.465]  And I want to find that one.
[01:02:18.505 --> 01:02:19.425]  I'll find it during the break.
[01:02:19.706 --> 01:02:20.946]  Because it's an important clip.
[01:02:22.567 --> 01:02:23.668]  And it needs to be played.
[01:02:25.908 --> 01:02:34.372]  Now, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, we will also get into some other news on the broadcast here today.
[01:02:34.392 --> 01:02:39.475]  1776 worldwide, the Second Amendment comes to Mexico.
[01:02:41.365 --> 01:02:46.949]  Very important article dealing with the two-hour radio show I did yesterday on this subject mainly.
[01:02:46.969 --> 01:02:50.711]  I did about an hour plus of the two-hour Sunday show on this.
[01:02:51.451 --> 01:02:56.154]  This proves individuals having guns lowers crime and returns civilization.
[01:02:56.475 --> 01:03:01.618]  This proves the Swiss-US-Dutch model that's been banned in the Netherlands.
[01:03:02.338 --> 01:03:04.180]  This proves the people are the answer.
[01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:11.070]  And I really like seeing Mexico turn the corner in many areas where the people have gotten guns illegally in the U.S.
[01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:19.022]  And I kind of did a quick rant Saturday on this on the YouTube where I say, you know, we're going to fight tyrants out there like Piers Morgan.
[01:03:20.464 --> 01:03:23.126]  And some people, trolls, said he's saying Piers Morgan's good.
[01:03:23.246 --> 01:03:24.347]  Everybody knows that's not what I'm saying.
[01:03:25.027 --> 01:03:27.389]  And then I went on to say Fast and Furious was bad.
[01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:36.615]  The government shipped guns in to blame it on the Mexican people and the American people so that the Mexicans couldn't have guns to defend themselves.
[01:03:37.015 --> 01:03:42.679]  The drug cartels buy weapons, military grade that you can't get in gun shops.
[01:03:42.879 --> 01:03:47.502]  So I was explaining that there are good things happening with guns from the U.S.
[01:03:47.522 --> 01:03:50.204]  getting into Mexico, but that Fast and Furious
[01:03:51.745 --> 01:04:06.194]  ...was a cover to keep legitimate guns getting to Mexicans to defend themselves and that the cartels buy mainly German armaments that they're obsessed with that are fully auto and tanks and things.
[01:04:06.214 --> 01:04:07.554]  So it was very clear what I was saying.
[01:04:08.335 --> 01:04:10.736]  And many people are just so dumb they don't understand on YouTube.
[01:04:11.237 --> 01:04:16.059]  Because after, you know, I shoot a special report on the weekend, upload it right to YouTube, the post on Infowars.com,
[01:04:17.193 --> 01:04:25.579]  I'm saying that Fast and Furious was meant to, you know, blame the cartel murders on the Second Amendment, not on the fact that guns from the U.S.
[01:04:25.639 --> 01:04:27.840]  are helping Mexican citizens defeat the cartels.
[01:04:28.401 --> 01:04:30.682]  And people went, what, you're saying now Fast and Furious was good?
[01:04:30.942 --> 01:04:41.490]  No, Fast and Furious was the government operation to frame guns bought over the counter for the destabilization of Mexico when it's the gun control and the drug war that's done it.
[01:04:42.694 --> 01:04:45.135]  Did I say that clearly, or am I not a good communicator?
[01:04:45.175 --> 01:04:45.896]  Guys, tell me the truth.
[01:04:45.916 --> 01:04:47.957]  I mean, did I just explain that or not?
[01:04:49.298 --> 01:04:49.898]  Be honest with me.
[01:04:49.918 --> 01:04:52.039]  I think you did a pretty good job, Alex.
[01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:53.200]  Okay.
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:54.280]  I'm not just saying that because you're my boss.
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:55.441]  No, I mean, literally.
[01:04:55.661 --> 01:04:56.261]  I don't understand.
[01:04:56.301 --> 01:04:56.782]  I explained that.
[01:04:56.802 --> 01:04:57.822]  People go, well, what?
[01:04:57.862 --> 01:04:59.663]  Now you're saying it's good Obama shipped guns in there?
[01:05:00.343 --> 01:05:00.704]  No!
[01:05:01.004 --> 01:05:08.368]  That was a small amount they shipped in to then trace them to try to blame the violence on our guns, not the cartels!
[01:05:09.867 --> 01:05:18.872]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:05:18.952 --> 01:05:27.056]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:05:27.356 --> 01:05:32.038]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[01:06:09.924 --> 01:06:13.926]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:06:13.946 --> 01:06:18.107]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:06:18.327 --> 01:06:21.728]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:06:21.989 --> 01:06:24.870]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:32.372]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:06:32.593 --> 01:06:36.234]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:06:36.434 --> 01:06:40.758]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:06:40.938 --> 01:06:46.863]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:06:46.903 --> 01:06:50.686]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:06:50.826 --> 01:06:53.408]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:06:53.588 --> 01:06:54.929]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:06:55.089 --> 01:06:56.310]  It's time to take action.
[01:06:56.451 --> 01:06:58.172]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:17.184]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:07:17.284 --> 01:07:19.465]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:07:19.646 --> 01:07:24.848]  Indoor air has been shown to have 2 to 5 times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:07:25.008 --> 01:07:30.111]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:07:30.251 --> 01:07:33.333]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:07:33.633 --> 01:07:37.556]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:07:37.756 --> 01:07:42.079]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:07:42.159 --> 01:07:52.306]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:07:52.506 --> 01:07:56.889]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[01:07:56.989 --> 01:08:03.433]  The new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[01:08:12.517 --> 01:08:18.540]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:22.122]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:25.854 --> 01:08:29.797]  Well, Dr. Steve Pachenik joins us for the next 45 minutes and I'm going to open the phones up.
[01:08:29.837 --> 01:08:31.218]  Dr. Steve Pachenik is an M.D.
[01:08:31.418 --> 01:08:32.278]  and a Ph.D.
[01:08:32.298 --> 01:08:36.321]  psychiatrist, an American former State Department official, author, and publisher.
[01:08:36.661 --> 01:08:39.603]  Wrote a bunch of books with Tom Clancy like NetForce and OpCenter.
[01:08:40.044 --> 01:08:41.124]  Produced a bunch of big films.
[01:08:41.144 --> 01:08:43.426]  StevePachenik.com is his website.
[01:08:43.846 --> 01:08:47.769]  trained in psychiatry at Harvard University and International Relations at MIT.
[01:08:48.270 --> 01:08:55.435]  His novels are based on over 20 years experience resolving international crises and hostage situations for the Department of State for four administrations.
[01:08:55.796 --> 01:08:59.999]  He was also instrumental in the Camp David Accords as well, and I'm witness to that.
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:07.205]  And he joins us, I want to cover the waterfront if you can, in little nodes here, and get your take on a whole bunch of stuff.
[01:09:08.626 --> 01:09:09.487]  Boca Haram,
[01:09:11.761 --> 01:09:14.044]  Is on record being protected by Hillary Clinton.
[01:09:14.064 --> 01:09:16.066]  You know, I know you don't think it's too bad.
[01:09:16.086 --> 01:09:18.690]  I mean, it's interesting who you like and who you don't like.
[01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:20.272]  But we'll see what you say today.
[01:09:20.512 --> 01:09:22.254]  She didn't want them designated as a terror group.
[01:09:22.614 --> 01:09:23.455]  Now this is happening.
[01:09:23.495 --> 01:09:24.457]  Looks staged to me.
[01:09:24.857 --> 01:09:26.319]  So is this even really Boko Haram?
[01:09:26.339 --> 01:09:26.779]  Who knows?
[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:29.703]  I want to get your take on the latest on the Benghazi committee.
[01:09:29.723 --> 01:09:30.824]  You say you've got intel on that.
[01:09:31.825 --> 01:09:34.448]  I want to get into what's happening in Syria, Ukraine.
[01:09:34.488 --> 01:09:38.292]  I want to cover the waterfront with Dr. Steve Pucinich.
[01:09:38.593 --> 01:09:40.114]  Doc, it's good to have you back on with us.
[01:09:40.134 --> 01:09:43.918]  You also wrote a book, started writing a book, I know, three years ago.
[01:09:43.958 --> 01:09:45.139]  I've seen this on the news.
[01:09:46.881 --> 01:09:49.664]  With the late Tom Clancy, so that got held up.
[01:09:49.744 --> 01:09:52.967]  So you wrote it, he wrote it, you finish it up with a couple of authors.
[01:09:53.668 --> 01:09:59.294]  So I guess you guys were working on a book about the Syria Civil War before it started or right as it was beginning to start.
[01:09:59.654 --> 01:10:05.741]  So I want to get your take on Out of the Ashes that's about to be published or is coming out very soon.
[01:10:06.161 --> 01:10:07.262]  So Doc, good to have you with us.
[01:10:07.302 --> 01:10:07.843]  A lot to cover.
[01:10:08.655 --> 01:10:11.197]  It's a grand pleasure to be with you, Alex.
[01:10:11.297 --> 01:10:13.538]  It's a wonderful time to always talk to your audience.
[01:10:13.578 --> 01:10:14.879]  There's a lot we're going to have to cover.
[01:10:14.939 --> 01:10:21.404]  The new book with Tom Clancy, Steve Pichenik, but written by George Galdarisi and Dick Couch, two excellent
[01:10:21.877 --> 01:10:45.284]  Military experts have been in the military, are still involved with national security, have written an excellent book, which we wrote about two to three years ago, predicting the ongoing slaughter in Syria and the fact that Syria, Tehran, Iran, and Russia would be aligned against Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and basically not getting the United States involved.
[01:10:45.344 --> 01:10:50.506]  But it was a war between the Shiites, the Sunni, and Muslims against the Christians.
[01:10:50.846 --> 01:10:55.329]  And what we wrote out of the ashes was that this is a complicated situation.
[01:10:55.389 --> 01:11:05.556]  We brought in the Navy, Special Forces, George Galdarisi, and Dick Couch did an excellent job of describing the various techniques that we would have used and have been using
[01:11:06.056 --> 01:11:18.042]  In Syria and the fact that we are using now special forces and CIA operatives out of Jordan who've been titrated, vetted out and guns were shipped into Syria.
[01:11:18.482 --> 01:11:22.944]  Now let me get out of the book for a minute and I think everybody should really take a look at that book.
[01:11:23.204 --> 01:11:24.725]  But let's talk about Benghazi.
[01:11:24.805 --> 01:11:27.726]  Why does Benghazi relate to Syria and why is now
[01:11:28.266 --> 01:11:42.723]  The investigation done by Trey Gowder, a very important investigation because for the most part Hillary Clinton is responsible for a lot of the negligence that was involved.
[01:11:43.303 --> 01:11:48.127]  In the State Department in terms of their indifference to what happened to Benghazi.
[01:11:48.167 --> 01:12:07.023]  I don't have to go over the entire story, but the key of the entire Benghazi investigation under the new federal prosecutor who comes out of South Carolina, and I have a lot of respect for him, is the fact that Trey Gowdy, who is a federal prosecutor, is a Republican, but is very neutral, really has to look at the new
[01:12:07.783 --> 01:12:11.207]  Uh, people who he has to bring, uh, subpoenas to.
[01:12:11.407 --> 01:12:16.653]  And that's not necessarily Hillary Clinton or Jerry or, uh, John Kerry.
[01:12:17.053 --> 01:12:19.436]  The following people should be subpoenaed.
[01:12:19.496 --> 01:12:21.498]  Number one, it's the people in the White House.
[01:12:21.919 --> 01:12:29.467]  Because what this is, and really what happened in Benghazi is a rogue operation that's consistent with what happened to
[01:12:29.969 --> 01:12:34.334]  William Colby in the 1970s under the Church Committee.
[01:12:34.554 --> 01:12:37.978]  Most people in the media really do not know what they're talking about.
[01:12:38.399 --> 01:12:50.332]  The only media that really had a very clear understanding was Fred Murdoch's and Roger Ailes' understanding that this was a coup attempt to get
[01:12:51.288 --> 01:12:54.110]  David Petraeus out by John Brennan.
[01:12:54.270 --> 01:13:04.436]  So what we're talking about now is that John Brennan, who is now the director of the CIA, but at the time when Benghazi occurred, he was an assistant to the President of the United States.
[01:13:04.536 --> 01:13:06.877]  He had no immunity whatsoever.
[01:13:07.358 --> 01:13:16.183]  He ran an illegal rogue operation, which was called SOCOM, Special Operations Command, which was a paramilitary unit that undermined
[01:13:17.190 --> 01:13:22.933]  David Petraeus, who's the head of the CIA, and they weren't running an embassy in Libya.
[01:13:23.013 --> 01:13:27.496]  That's why Hillary Clinton could claim, well, that wasn't really our involvement.
[01:13:27.516 --> 01:13:36.221]  By the way, you said this weeks after it happened, and now a lot of it has come out, that indeed it was a clandestine arms shipment to the jihadis.
[01:13:37.322 --> 01:13:39.903]  That's correct Alex, as usually you're correct.
[01:13:39.963 --> 01:13:49.748]  Not only was it a clandestine arm shipment to the jihadis, but it was also a terror center and it was not an official embassy.
[01:13:50.209 --> 01:13:54.791]  That's why the ambassador happened to be there, but he waived any protection.
[01:13:55.191 --> 01:14:02.295]  That's why he said basically to Eric Boswell and Pat Kennedy of the State Department when I knew that I'm taken care of.
[01:14:02.335 --> 01:14:07.138]  But he had nothing to do with the buildings that we've seen and where the violence occurred.
[01:14:07.178 --> 01:14:18.645]  That was a counselor office, which is not under the protection of the State Department, but is actually a safe house where the CIA and SOCOM were able to interrogate prisoners
[01:14:19.345 --> 01:14:19.946]  I don't know.
[01:14:35.249 --> 01:14:49.313]  And David Petraeus, who was undermined as the director of the CIA by John Brennan and sending his SOCOM troops under the direction of McRaven and the Navy and paramilitary organizations.
[01:14:49.393 --> 01:14:53.535]  So what we have here is a rogue operation that harks back to the 1970s.
[01:14:55.245 --> 01:15:06.748]  Well, William Colby was running rogue operations under the CIA, but in this case, the CIA was directed by Petraeus, and it was an attempt by John Brennan, who was the consultant.
[01:15:07.845 --> 01:15:15.690]  To the President, who tried to undermine Petraeus and got rid of him and then used the libel.
[01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:35.282]  So what we have here is a very important chance for the American government to look at a period of time which is not McCarthyism in terms of Republican insights and investigation, but in terms of a McCarthyism that's replete and orchestrated by the Obama administration.
[01:15:35.342 --> 01:15:45.610]  Well let me stop you right there, because undoubtedly, let's pull back, undoubtedly Turkey's been caught running false flags to blame Syria, nobody's romanticizing Assad, but you knew the father and the son, I want you to talk about that.
[01:15:46.611 --> 01:15:51.855]  Expanding now, the Al-Qaeda forces that have been built up in western Iraq are now even allowed to attack.
[01:15:52.976 --> 01:16:03.781]  A major city, so that's a pretext for more occupation of Iraq, the order-out-of-chaos system, with these corporate interests who don't have America's interests at heart, but only have destabilization at heart.
[01:16:04.142 --> 01:16:08.584]  And then I tie that into now the globalists using Libya as an AFRICOM base.
[01:16:09.284 --> 01:16:21.094]  To launch all sorts of destabilization operations all over Africa, from Uganda right over to Sierra Leone, right over to the Ivory Coast, right over to Nigeria.
[01:16:21.695 --> 01:16:29.261]  I mean, really, aren't we seeing kind of a great game, a Zbigniew Brzezinski program that then kind of meets a neocon program?
[01:16:29.281 --> 01:16:31.123]  Because, you know, we can say it's a rogue operation.
[01:16:31.343 --> 01:16:33.665]  We know they always allow groups to, quote, operate rogues.
[01:16:33.685 --> 01:16:34.445]  They deny it later.
[01:16:34.666 --> 01:16:37.268]  But there is a certified move by Obama
[01:16:38.429 --> 01:16:44.896]  Well, that's correct.
[01:16:45.977 --> 01:16:47.419]  Alex, you're absolutely correct.
[01:16:47.519 --> 01:16:57.150]  What happened, however, like all arming of terrorist groups, there was a blowback back to the Saudi government in the past two, three weeks.
[01:16:57.808 --> 01:17:07.716]  I have been informed and I've been monitoring the situation where the Soleimani brothers, it's only seven who control Saudi Arabia, they are not in good shape.
[01:17:08.176 --> 01:17:18.264]  They have lost their oil capability, they have increased their unemployment, but they basically have now had to fight the very organization that they created.
[01:17:18.684 --> 01:17:22.906]  The Salafists, the Sufis, the Al-Qaeda, the Al-Qaeda of Africa.
[01:17:23.286 --> 01:17:32.791]  So now they've been informed that they have to now fight the very organizations who were sent into Syria to fight against... That's the intel I was given.
[01:17:32.811 --> 01:17:33.392]  Let me stop you.
[01:17:33.412 --> 01:17:42.736]  That this is a quadruple cross by the globalists to actually destabilize not just Syria and Iran, but to take down Saudi Arabia in the final equation.
[01:17:43.036 --> 01:17:45.798]  What's your inside scoop on what they plan to replace it with?
[01:17:46.724 --> 01:17:49.065]  I'm not going to replace Saudi Arabia with anything.
[01:17:49.125 --> 01:17:51.986]  Saudi Arabia is now a failed state, Alex.
[01:17:52.026 --> 01:18:07.150]  From my point of view, because it has 40% unemployment, it has water piercing right through its oil wells, it can no longer turn out the production of oil that we, the United States, do not need because we're net exporters of gas.
[01:18:07.170 --> 01:18:11.011]  So now the globalists are done with Saudi Arabia, now it's just going to be put into a failed state.
[01:18:11.966 --> 01:18:12.046]  It's
[01:18:27.424 --> 01:18:35.251]  Jordan, so you have a coalition of kind of quasi-marginalized groups, which will be not relevant to our strategic interest.
[01:18:35.591 --> 01:18:46.460]  Our strategic interests are now moving to think back, or the Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Ocean, with regard to China, China's war with Japan, and China's war with Vietnam.
[01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:49.663]  And that's what I wrote about 20 years ago on Pacifica.
[01:18:50.203 --> 01:18:59.110]  We're in fact the Chinese are going out of their way to create a problem in a small group of islands which are 120 miles.
[01:18:59.530 --> 01:19:04.794]  And is that what the... I want to come back then after this break and break down the geopolitical ramifications.
[01:19:04.814 --> 01:19:09.717]  But I remember you on this show about three or four years ago talking about the pivot before it happened.
[01:19:10.578 --> 01:19:21.146]  And then talk about strategically then how the system knew and kind of what some of the power blocks are inside the Anglo-American establishment.
[01:19:21.446 --> 01:19:26.450]  Because I know there's different factions, but the faction I don't like is the one teaching kids 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[01:19:27.230 --> 01:19:29.692]  It's the faction saying there shouldn't be fathers in families.
[01:19:30.052 --> 01:19:32.534]  It's the faction not letting us have power plants.
[01:19:32.994 --> 01:19:34.696]  I mean, I want to talk about the factions here.
[01:19:35.516 --> 01:19:40.941]  That are running this country into the ground, because they do some things that help the country and the people, and other things that hurt us.
[01:19:41.321 --> 01:19:43.664]  So I want to talk to Steve Pchenik, who's an Insider's Insider.
[01:19:44.044 --> 01:19:50.310]  Straight ahead, his new book, that he and Tom Clancy were working on, is now being published posthumously.
[01:19:50.330 --> 01:19:51.531]  Here's Bigger Writer's Pcheniker.
[01:19:52.091 --> 01:19:55.675]  Clancy, they just have guys that basically work with it and kind of publicly ghostwrite it.
[01:19:56.075 --> 01:19:58.638]  So he talked about those two Navy guys that have put the book out.
[01:19:59.119 --> 01:20:00.921]  So that's coming out as well.
[01:20:01.461 --> 01:20:02.683]  It's all coming up.
[01:20:02.763 --> 01:20:05.466]  This is not your daddy's talk radio.
[01:20:05.486 --> 01:20:08.169]  This is real analysis, deep information.
[01:20:10.057 --> 01:20:13.219]  Harvest Right is the world's first in-home freeze-dryer.

[01:23:08.772 --> 01:23:11.353]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:23:11.613 --> 01:23:16.495]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at My Patriot Supply.
[01:23:16.735 --> 01:23:24.578]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:23:24.838 --> 01:23:29.161]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[01:23:29.361 --> 01:23:33.204]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:23:33.344 --> 01:23:39.068]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:23:39.308 --> 01:23:42.070]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:47.614]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:23:47.814 --> 01:23:55.942]  Go to MyPatriotsSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[01:23:56.002 --> 01:23:56.282]  That's 866-229-0927.
[01:23:56.322 --> 01:23:59.005]  Do business with someone who shares your values.
[01:23:59.045 --> 01:24:00.166]  MyPatriotsSupply.com slash Alex.
[01:24:10.038 --> 01:24:17.183]  Even Naomi Wolf has come out and talked about the CIA's ties.
[01:24:29.352 --> 01:24:31.833]  To Boko Haram, this is a destabilization force.
[01:24:31.854 --> 01:24:36.116]  I'm not even blaming the CIA, there's a whole bunch of groups that want destabilization.
[01:24:36.776 --> 01:24:44.280]  And you know, I can sit back and see the plan to destabilize Saudi Arabia, the plan to destabilize Iran, the plan to destabilize Ukraine, the plan to destabilize, you know.
[01:24:44.661 --> 01:24:55.747]  But then the very same globalists that are doing that, arguing they want to build this world government to stop war, are the ones trying to break up families, cut off our energy, using their power to consolidate control.
[01:24:58.644 --> 01:25:05.807]  I don't see the New World Order, as George Herbert Walker Bush called for it, bringing stability or order.
[01:25:07.147 --> 01:25:08.368]  I see it bringing disorder.
[01:25:08.848 --> 01:25:11.989]  And of course, the Russians have their New World Order, the Chinese have their New World Order.
[01:25:12.669 --> 01:25:14.950]  All I see is a bunch of kleptocrats
[01:25:17.190 --> 01:25:19.012]  Excusing their predatory actions.
[01:25:19.932 --> 01:25:23.496]  And it's the opposite of a society that I think is going to survive.
[01:25:23.876 --> 01:25:26.198]  Dr. Pucinich, I mean, I'm just throwing that out there on the table.
[01:25:26.438 --> 01:25:29.301]  I can see the great game, the divide and conquer, all of it.
[01:25:30.241 --> 01:25:32.523]  But America really is losing its moral high ground.
[01:25:32.804 --> 01:25:35.286]  Who are the players in the power structure from your perspective?
[01:25:36.502 --> 01:25:42.525]  Players in the power structures are number one, the banking industry, the oil conglomerates that come out.
[01:25:42.645 --> 01:25:46.567]  You have the major energy companies coming out of Texas.
[01:25:47.048 --> 01:25:54.472]  You have the military-industrial complex like Northrop Grumman, Lockheed, ATK, which provides ammunition.
[01:25:55.092 --> 01:25:58.354]  You have Raytheon, which provides the military-industrial.
[01:25:58.394 --> 01:26:04.217]  You have a whole series of beltway bandits who have nothing else to do except to take
[01:26:04.633 --> 01:26:21.741]  The rotational system of generals who have failed in the military, they get their pensions of $150,000, they're offered $2 billion as they were in Booz Allen, which Snowden came out of, and then they get retread again into a military industrial complex.
[01:26:21.781 --> 01:26:23.162]  So we don't really have a government.
[01:26:23.522 --> 01:26:30.065]  What we have is an outsourcing machine, which we American people are paying twice for and getting no outside product.
[01:26:30.485 --> 01:26:33.606]  So what you have is not a unified world structure.
[01:26:33.686 --> 01:26:50.852]  What you have is a constant, ongoing system, which is a dysfunctional banking system of money just going around through military, industrial, energy complex, Northrop Grumman, CACI, SAIC, L3, MITRE, Blackwater,
[01:26:51.432 --> 01:27:01.922]  All of which are in the business of creating what Kissinger used to call strategic tension or problems, and then they ship that out to our military or paramilitary units.
[01:27:02.243 --> 01:27:06.066]  And what happens is the paramilitary units, they're under the control of the CIA.
[01:27:06.407 --> 01:27:07.508]  That has to be stopped.
[01:27:08.008 --> 01:27:13.614]  All paramilitary units have to go back into the military and the CIA has to be investigated.
[01:27:13.634 --> 01:27:30.111]  They have to be completely cleaned out and John Brennan has to go in front of the Benghazi committee without immunity because he's on an accepted service and the prosecutor has to start questioning him as he did William Colby in the
[01:27:30.391 --> 01:27:35.714]  I want to get into that with you and talk about a bunch of other big issues that tie together and where you see the world going with Dr. Steve Pcheneg.
[01:27:36.074 --> 01:27:37.554]  StevePcheneg.com.
[01:27:37.955 --> 01:27:40.496]  The world government does not exist as the world government.
[01:27:40.536 --> 01:27:47.659]  What is in fact happening is we are losing our priority in the world systems on several levels.
[01:27:48.368 --> 01:27:53.456]  Number one, because we have weak leadership, consistent from Clinton on Bush Jr.
[01:27:53.516 --> 01:27:55.278]  to Obama, who's a disaster.
[01:27:55.759 --> 01:27:57.181]  A man who never had a job.
[01:27:57.602 --> 01:27:59.524]  A man who never had an executive position.
[01:27:59.544 --> 01:28:01.267]  A man who never even was a senator.
[01:28:01.387 --> 01:28:03.090]  He was a false senator, wrote a book.
[01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:08.852]  Who came out of the CIA, had never had any experience, and they cannot make any decision.
[01:28:09.072 --> 01:28:14.194]  He's run by a woman named Valerie Jarrett in the White House, who comes from Chicago.
[01:28:14.214 --> 01:28:17.796]  Her father was in Iran, probably was a CIA operative.
[01:28:18.116 --> 01:28:22.738]  He comes out of the CIA, went to Occidental College, which was the CIA agency.
[01:28:23.198 --> 01:28:25.020]  I never really had any experience.
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:27.922]  He is totally incompetent, dysfunctional.
[01:28:28.402 --> 01:28:41.612]  A man like Putin, who's been in the intelligence community, sees it very clearly, sees his indecisiveness, sees the fact that we have no strategic sense either in Crimea or Ukraine, which by the way, Crimea does belong to Russia.
[01:28:42.033 --> 01:28:51.560]  I was there when we took down the Soviet Union and it was an informal agreement that Crimea would always remain to the Soviet system or the Russian system because it's the only port.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.441]  Which belongs to Russian.
[01:28:53.481 --> 01:28:58.924]  It's the only place where the Russian battleships and Navy can get out on the warm water port.
[01:28:58.964 --> 01:29:04.108]  So it's not a question of Anschluss or Nazi annexation.
[01:29:04.488 --> 01:29:10.852]  It was all started by, again, incompetent people under John Kerry by the name of Valerie Nuland.
[01:29:11.232 --> 01:29:29.938]  Who's an Assistant Secretary of State for Victoria Nuland, who's Assistant Secretary of State for Western Europe, probably a CIA cover, was related to a neocon, started all these problems while Putin was in Sochi, and started to create what we call agitation propaganda.
[01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:31.559]  Agitation propaganda.
[01:29:31.639 --> 01:29:32.219]  Agit-prop.
[01:29:32.519 --> 01:29:33.739]  Stay there, Dr. Pucinich.
[01:29:34.119 --> 01:29:38.541]  I want to come right back and break all this down and where you see it going, because
[01:29:39.381 --> 01:29:47.648]  Look, Obama is so busy trying to wreck our education system, trying to target the Tea Party and gun owners and libertarians with homeland security.
[01:29:48.849 --> 01:29:55.535]  I want to talk about the degeneracy infesting the ruling class of really wanting to undermine their empire.
[01:29:55.695 --> 01:29:56.916]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:29:56.936 --> 01:29:57.557]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:59.038 --> 01:29:59.919]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.419 --> 01:30:02.041]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.961 --> 01:30:05.644]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.761 --> 01:30:13.083]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[01:30:13.203 --> 01:30:15.445]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[01:30:15.625 --> 01:30:23.910]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:34.437]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:30:34.757 --> 01:30:48.145]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency, Super Mel Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:30:48.566 --> 01:30:54.669]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:30:54.910 --> 01:31:03.535]  For a limited time, we are offering 15% off Super Mel Vitality at InfoWarsLife.com to introduce you to this powerful supplement.
[01:31:03.655 --> 01:31:07.621]  Visit Infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality.
[01:31:07.801 --> 01:31:08.642]  Infowarslife.com
[01:31:10.322 --> 01:31:16.446]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[01:31:16.466 --> 01:31:19.768]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:31:19.788 --> 01:31:20.569]  Here we go, folks!
[01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:21.469]  I'm being assaulted!
[01:31:21.489 --> 01:31:27.773]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:31:27.893 --> 01:31:33.757]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote homeless security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[01:31:33.937 --> 01:31:37.702]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:31:37.902 --> 01:31:40.805]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:31:40.845 --> 01:31:48.995]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:31:49.255 --> 01:31:51.317]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:31:51.378 --> 01:31:52.399]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:31:52.759 --> 01:32:01.507]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[01:32:01.707 --> 01:32:04.149]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.

[01:32:10.086 --> 01:32:13.007]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:32:13.027 --> 01:32:15.108]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[01:32:15.308 --> 01:32:21.250]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[01:32:21.470 --> 01:32:26.471]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[01:32:26.551 --> 01:32:31.253]  The new InfoWars Life silver bullet colloidal silver is the answer for you and your family.
[01:32:31.433 --> 01:32:34.254]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives.
[01:32:34.434 --> 01:32:44.622]  The Infowars LifeSilver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a two ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[01:32:44.862 --> 01:32:46.803]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[01:32:47.004 --> 01:32:54.149]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver.
[01:32:54.329 --> 01:33:00.896]  Using electrical processes within a base of deionized water for your preparedness storage or your home kitchen.
[01:33:01.016 --> 01:33:09.165]  Purchase your bottle of InfoWarsLife.com Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver today and find other amazing supplements at InfoWarsLife.com
[01:33:28.038 --> 01:33:32.480]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:33:33.081 --> 01:33:34.561]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:36.963 --> 01:33:54.552]  I'm seeing more and more mainline university reports in the news where they admit the political class worldwide wants things to destabilize because then they can distract off one of those new problems and not build a better civilization.
[01:33:56.297 --> 01:33:59.818]  So it really is a, I would call it a mental illness in the ruling class.
[01:33:59.858 --> 01:34:01.659]  Like, I don't want an American empire.
[01:34:02.979 --> 01:34:03.759]  We don't even have that.
[01:34:03.799 --> 01:34:18.904]  We have this corporate revolving door empire of all these special interests who are so removed from the ground that they're doing very dangerous things, very dehumanizing things, and not taking any responsibility for it.
[01:34:21.015 --> 01:34:22.477]  It's a very serious situation.
[01:34:22.537 --> 01:34:29.384]  I saw an MIT report just last year we covered where they said, we have transferred our high-tech systems and can basically never beat China now.
[01:34:30.025 --> 01:34:33.228]  And that it's true, the deindustrialization, they claim that we would have high-tech stuff.
[01:34:33.248 --> 01:34:33.609]  We don't.
[01:34:33.889 --> 01:34:34.389]  We're screwed.
[01:34:34.750 --> 01:34:36.372]  Yeah, the elite believe their own bull.
[01:34:37.577 --> 01:34:39.717]  And then now, what are we going to do?
[01:34:39.938 --> 01:34:42.118]  Dr. Steve Pucinich has been warning about this for decades.
[01:34:42.458 --> 01:34:43.858]  We're going back to him in a moment.
[01:34:43.878 --> 01:34:44.339]  We've got him.
[01:34:45.539 --> 01:34:48.359]  We'll just go the whole hour with him, if he can do it, and then take calls in the third hour.
[01:34:48.379 --> 01:34:50.020]  I've got a bunch of news I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:57.221]  But before we go any further, ladies and gentlemen, this hour is brought to you by mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex.
[01:34:57.922 --> 01:35:01.842]  And they are great, high-quality, storable foods, non-GMO, great customer service.
[01:35:02.183 --> 01:35:03.623]  They've got a lot of their preparedness items.
[01:35:04.562 --> 01:35:06.505]  MyPatronSupply.com forward slash Alex.
[01:35:06.926 --> 01:35:11.633]  If you do not have storable food, I think you're crazy in this unstable world that lasts more than 20 years.
[01:35:12.315 --> 01:35:15.079]  You can give them a call at 866-229-0927.
[01:35:15.419 --> 01:35:17.383]  MyPatronSupply.com forward slash Alex.
[01:35:17.863 --> 01:35:18.444]  And then of course,
[01:35:19.636 --> 01:35:33.201]  We're mainly funded by viewers and listeners like you out there that are members to PrisonPlanet.tv to see the nightly news and all my films and the high-def commercial-free video and audio podcasts of the daytime show and live special events and so much more.
[01:35:33.221 --> 01:35:35.442]  You're really funding the tip of the spear on the info war.
[01:35:35.902 --> 01:35:40.203]  As Hillary says, the establishment's losing the info war and we're proud to be right at the forefront of that.
[01:35:41.144 --> 01:35:43.845]  Because these people can get away with anything if we're not exposing what they're up to.
[01:35:44.758 --> 01:35:52.782]  And then finally, you can get the very best water filtration systems anywhere at the lowest price, 10% off with promo code WATER.
[01:35:53.282 --> 01:35:59.606]  ProPure, ProOne, G2, 2.0 filters, cut out the glyphosates, the fluoride, everything.
[01:36:00.086 --> 01:36:02.507]  They're the same price or lower than the leading competitors.
[01:36:02.907 --> 01:36:07.730]  The leading competitors, just side-by-side comparisons at info or store.com.
[01:36:07.850 --> 01:36:09.911]  It blows the competition away.
[01:36:09.931 --> 01:36:11.011]  Or we'd sell the competition.
[01:36:11.312 --> 01:36:12.572]  We'd sell everything at a low price.
[01:36:12.892 --> 01:36:13.553]  We're a free market.
[01:36:14.414 --> 01:36:15.595]  But there's just nothing that compares.
[01:36:15.615 --> 01:36:19.040]  We've got some LifeStraws and other systems that are great as well, but they don't cut everything out.
[01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:21.223]  They just make water safe to drink.
[01:36:21.684 --> 01:36:23.607]  These are basic things everybody needs.
[01:36:24.659 --> 01:36:25.960]  The system wants us dependent.
[01:36:26.020 --> 01:36:27.202]  We need to be independent.
[01:36:27.262 --> 01:36:29.704]  Our own media, our own food, our own gardens.
[01:36:29.744 --> 01:36:33.027]  We have the best seed center for your summer or fall garden coming up.
[01:36:33.408 --> 01:36:34.169]  Get started now.

[01:36:39.214 --> 01:36:41.776]  The lowest prices at the Infowars Seed Center.
[01:36:42.177 --> 01:36:43.318]  InfowarsStore.com
[01:36:44.759 --> 01:36:48.482]  And finally, we have InfoWarsLife.com with the best organic coffee.
[01:36:49.243 --> 01:36:49.823]  It's my favorite.
[01:36:49.843 --> 01:36:50.344]  People love it.
[01:36:50.604 --> 01:36:51.685]  Wake of America coffee.
[01:36:52.286 --> 01:36:55.108]  We've, from Chiapas, Mexico, grown on the high mountains there.
[01:36:56.609 --> 01:36:58.251]  Super high quality organic soil.
[01:36:58.631 --> 01:37:02.134]  We've got the InfoWars Life nascent iodine, unlike any other out there.
[01:37:02.715 --> 01:37:05.537]  We've got the Survival Shield nascent iodine.
[01:37:05.577 --> 01:37:06.918]  We've got the Lung Cleanse.
[01:37:07.479 --> 01:37:10.101]  We've got the Super Mel Vitality you've heard all the rave reviews from.
[01:37:10.441 --> 01:37:10.841]  Try it!
[01:37:11.542 --> 01:37:16.086]  Bare minimum you're supporting the broadcast, but once people try it, the rave reviews from what it does.
[01:37:16.166 --> 01:37:20.149]  It's not a mimicker of steroids, of testosterone.
[01:37:20.790 --> 01:37:26.474]  It is a system known to block estrogen mimickers and stimulate your glands to naturally produce.
[01:37:26.815 --> 01:37:28.016]  You've seen the rave reviews.
[01:37:28.596 --> 01:37:32.637]  I still am not the prettiest man in the world, but people tell me I've lost a lot of weight and look great.
[01:37:32.957 --> 01:37:34.257]  This has helped me work out more.
[01:37:34.637 --> 01:37:35.778]  Super Male Vitality.
[01:37:35.918 --> 01:37:38.218]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:37:38.298 --> 01:37:40.099]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:37:40.139 --> 01:37:41.779]  The Pro-Gun Milan Labe shirts.
[01:37:42.359 --> 01:37:43.099]  Women's Apparel.
[01:37:43.199 --> 01:37:44.000]  Made in America.
[01:37:44.020 --> 01:37:45.080]  888-253-3139.
[01:37:45.420 --> 01:37:46.680]  You can call.
[01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:51.061]  We'll send you a free catalog or answer any of your questions.
[01:37:51.081 --> 01:37:52.222]  888-253-3139.
[01:37:52.722 --> 01:37:57.723]  Now, I'm going to try to shut up and give you the floor, Dr. Pachenik.
[01:37:58.163 --> 01:38:22.111]  So you can really get rolling here, but we can look at all the battlefields and all the manipulations and all the special interests and all the Obama vacations, more than any other president, and the authoritarianism of the First Lady saying, don't say bossy, and all the rest of it, and Hillary, you know, saying let's save the girls when she wouldn't put Boko Haram on the terror list.
[01:38:24.011 --> 01:38:34.438]  The degeneracy of the system, the corruption, the disconnect, the Obama saying raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt, saying if you have a business you didn't build that.
[01:38:36.784 --> 01:38:42.710]  The communist slogans leaned forward right out of Karl Marx on MSNBC and CNN.
[01:38:43.431 --> 01:38:46.334]  I mean, really, I never believed it was a communist conspiracy.
[01:38:46.634 --> 01:38:49.857]  I knew that special interests used that to domesticate people.
[01:38:50.258 --> 01:38:54.982]  But now I realize that the only ones active and mobile in the corrupt corporate system
[01:38:55.803 --> 01:39:04.731]  are a bunch of really sickening authoritarian folks that are calling for the arrest of anybody who is right of Mao Zedong.
[01:39:05.171 --> 01:39:07.493]  And I see the CIA helping put Mao in on all this.
[01:39:07.914 --> 01:39:12.037]  I mean, it really freaks me out to think, who are the ruling class?
[01:39:12.257 --> 01:39:13.458]  What is the ideology?
[01:39:13.819 --> 01:39:15.440]  Why do they hate Christians so much?
[01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:16.481]  Dr. Pachinik.
[01:39:17.912 --> 01:39:22.936]  Well, number one, I don't think there's any more of what we would call a ruling class.
[01:39:22.976 --> 01:39:27.199]  What we have is just, we have a fractionation of a government.
[01:39:27.740 --> 01:39:39.749]  And basically, in some ways, it's really quite good because we have a totally incompetent president, followed by a formally incompetent president, followed by a formally immoral incompetent president.
[01:39:40.289 --> 01:39:42.571]  So for 30 years, we've had no one
[01:39:43.035 --> 01:39:48.137]  He's really been in charge and has had any capability to run this country.
[01:39:48.257 --> 01:39:51.819]  However, that doesn't mean they're not vitriolic and they were not dangerous.
[01:39:52.359 --> 01:39:53.579]  As you know, Bush Jr.
[01:39:53.639 --> 01:39:58.321]  initiated 9-11, initiated the Iraq War, and then lied.
[01:39:58.501 --> 01:40:04.404]  What we have here with Obama is a total sociopath, quite ignorant, quite incompetent.
[01:40:04.504 --> 01:40:07.425]  I've said it for years from the beginning, Alex, when you and I talk.
[01:40:07.885 --> 01:40:09.026]  Very dysfunctional.
[01:40:09.406 --> 01:40:11.368]  He's a product of Valerie Jarrett.
[01:40:11.388 --> 01:40:23.816]  He's a product of the banking system and the Pfizer companies, the big pharma, where he gave them $80 billion for a very dysfunctional health care system called Obamacare.
[01:40:24.257 --> 01:40:28.340]  And now what you have is basically companies on their own saying, you know what?
[01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:30.101]  To hell with America.
[01:40:30.441 --> 01:40:31.742]  And they really don't care.
[01:40:32.102 --> 01:40:37.086]  The companies have become basically these egregiously greedy
[01:40:37.586 --> 01:40:42.288]  Self-important companies that have no loyalty to the United States.
[01:40:42.348 --> 01:41:03.076]  For example, Pfizer, one of the biggest billion-dollar companies in the United States that supplies our medicine, has decided to leave our tax system and do what we call an inversion and go to England so that they can buy a lousy company called AstraZeneca, which is worth nothing on the equity basis, in order to avoid our taxes.
[01:41:03.556 --> 01:41:16.525]  So the job of all of our companies has not been to be an American company or a flagship, but it's to avoid taxes, to produce the greatest amount of profit, and to make sure that they pay the least amount of money.
[01:41:16.965 --> 01:41:19.687]  So there's no sense of American affiliation.
[01:41:19.727 --> 01:41:20.728]  Where does that come from?
[01:41:21.068 --> 01:41:23.790]  It comes from the very top, as you correctly stated.
[01:41:24.390 --> 01:41:26.493]  Is there a wild, wide cabal?
[01:41:26.874 --> 01:41:27.074]  No.
[01:41:27.534 --> 01:41:40.952]  Because it's so diffractionated, it is so self-oriented, it is so egregiously greedy and dysfunctional that what's happening is everybody now is going out on their own, even our own generals.
[01:41:41.312 --> 01:41:41.613]  I'm good.
[01:41:54.887 --> 01:41:55.928]  Well, I was about to say...
[01:42:21.309 --> 01:42:33.236]  From what I know, just 20-30 years ago, most people who were in the CIA were mainly Christians, conservative types, maybe misguided, but super focused, top of their class.
[01:42:33.876 --> 01:42:47.064]  Nowadays, because they're all over the place, they've like tripled the size of it, it's literally guys just sitting around bragging that they're in the CIA to girls and walking around with black suits and black sunglasses, just acting like they're secret police.
[01:42:48.044 --> 01:42:51.967]  I mean, more and more we're acting like a third world country is what I'm saying.
[01:42:52.007 --> 01:42:52.567]  Exactly.
[01:42:53.348 --> 01:42:55.630]  You're correct.
[01:42:56.170 --> 01:43:04.496]  I want you to realize that we, the American people, among your audience, we're spending over $180 billion for intelligence that's worth nothing.
[01:43:05.063 --> 01:43:07.225]  Most of the CIA are outsourced.
[01:43:07.286 --> 01:43:13.372]  That's 70 to 80 percent of the people who work in the CIA really don't get paid by the CIA itself.
[01:43:13.452 --> 01:43:20.540]  They then join SAIC, CAIC, MITRE, all these cut out organizations that are totally worthless.
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:22.462]  And then you have all these think tanks.
[01:43:22.802 --> 01:43:31.047]  Then you have the Secret Service, which really never serves the American public, but serves their own needs and maintains that they protect the President.
[01:43:31.187 --> 01:43:33.809]  Protected Presidents are dispensable.
[01:43:34.169 --> 01:43:36.030]  The country is not dispensable.
[01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:38.191]  The office of the President is not dispensable.
[01:43:38.471 --> 01:43:43.154]  Yet not one Secret Service agent ever stood up and said, Obama's lying.
[01:43:43.654 --> 01:43:44.555]  Bush was lying.
[01:43:45.055 --> 01:43:46.016]  Clinton was lying.
[01:43:46.136 --> 01:43:47.337]  They never said a word.
[01:43:47.357 --> 01:43:49.759]  So their loyalty is not to the country.
[01:43:50.119 --> 01:43:53.562]  It is to their own jobs and their own sense of secrecy.
[01:43:53.602 --> 01:43:59.928]  So what we have is a government of military intelligence and secrecy within this republic.
[01:44:00.348 --> 01:44:06.972]  Which has never been opened up, which has never been fragmented by great Christians like General Eisenhower.
[01:44:07.472 --> 01:44:16.937]  Even Jimmy Carter fired 9,000 CIA operatives and they call him dysfunctional, yet he was the one who made a treaty between Israel and Egypt.
[01:44:16.997 --> 01:44:19.038]  I haven't seen any other president say it.
[01:44:19.399 --> 01:44:27.143]  And we have lost the Christian, Judaic values of this country and it became a monetary, greedy,
[01:44:27.703 --> 01:44:29.164]  Self-absorbed country.
[01:44:29.264 --> 01:44:31.366]  Now, how does that relate to our education?
[01:44:31.466 --> 01:44:33.728]  Our education is a disaster.
[01:44:34.269 --> 01:44:36.490]  It is a disaster of the highest order.
[01:44:37.031 --> 01:44:44.217]  I've gone to Cornell, MIT, and Harvard, and I can tell you that each of those schools have literally whored their way
[01:44:44.797 --> 01:44:46.658]  Into mercenary activity.
[01:44:47.119 --> 01:44:50.841]  I recently took a course at MIT on Internet Big Data.
[01:44:50.981 --> 01:44:56.425]  It was a terrible course, yet it gave away its MIT prestige because it needed the money.
[01:44:56.745 --> 01:45:04.230]  Now, one of the teachers was really an American, and those who were American knew nothing about banking and knew nothing about finance.
[01:45:04.270 --> 01:45:04.790]  No, that's it.
[01:45:04.910 --> 01:45:06.792]  Americans know how to act tough.
[01:45:06.832 --> 01:45:11.175]  Now, the hard-working truck drivers and farmers and school teachers, people, they're all trying.
[01:45:11.855 --> 01:45:22.257]  But literally, anyone in the establishment now just goes around posing all day, talking about how smart they are, and I talk to executives and people now, and they don't know anything either.
[01:45:22.297 --> 01:45:23.157]  It's really scary.
[01:45:23.377 --> 01:45:23.557]  No.
[01:45:24.037 --> 01:45:34.679]  And not only is it scary, but you just had an example at Walmart where they lost money, yet the executives made money while the employees lost their money and lost the stock value.
[01:45:34.999 --> 01:45:41.040]  So you have a very criminal, inconsistent system where we don't have an oversight.
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:43.342]  Congress has to be eliminated.
[01:45:43.662 --> 01:45:51.650]  The entire system of Congress and the Senate is nothing more than a fancy welfare state unless we begin to bring in new parties.
[01:45:51.710 --> 01:45:54.113]  We can no longer have the Republican and Democrats.
[01:45:54.433 --> 01:45:59.498]  They're dysfunctional, they're sociopathic, and we need new parties that come up.
[01:46:01.118 --> 01:46:12.041]  We need more than two parties, and we need to break through this notion that if a Republican comes up for a Democrat, it's absolutely irrelevant.
[01:46:12.341 --> 01:46:14.401]  Look at the absurdity of where we've come.
[01:46:14.441 --> 01:46:20.583]  We've come through 30 years of disgrace, immorality, and achristian values, and who would he come up with?
[01:46:20.983 --> 01:46:22.183]  Bush and Hillary Clinton.
[01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:31.236]  That is a disgraceful stigma on the American public to say these are the only two candidates that we have of a president.
[01:46:31.396 --> 01:46:33.238]  No, we should have had more candidates.
[01:46:33.598 --> 01:46:36.120]  We have great Americans, even like you.
[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:38.101]  I don't care if you started a party.
[01:46:38.562 --> 01:46:39.482]  It's not relevant.
[01:46:39.903 --> 01:46:40.663]  I'm serious.
[01:46:40.823 --> 01:46:49.470]  And I don't care if a libertarian starts a party, Rand Paul, anyone, but they have to be able to break into the system and have the experience
[01:46:51.095 --> 01:47:00.159]  Sure, but let me ask you this question, because you're a top analyst and the head of PSYOPS for the State Department and have run just countless secret operations, so I respect your view on this.
[01:47:00.519 --> 01:47:04.441]  Where does your gut tell you, Dr. Pachinik, the world is going?
[01:47:04.881 --> 01:47:07.982]  What does your gut tell you is going to happen to Western civilization?
[01:47:08.443 --> 01:47:14.145]  You were starting to get into China and the pivot there and what China was doing earlier when we went to break.
[01:47:14.426 --> 01:47:15.286]  Talk about that some.
[01:47:16.121 --> 01:47:20.143]  Well, my gut is telling me that things are not good in America, overall.
[01:47:20.383 --> 01:47:24.565]  In terms of the overall regime of America, we no longer need it.
[01:47:25.185 --> 01:47:32.728]  I'm telling you from a gut level, having worked after five presidents, I want to inform your audience, a president is really only good for 100 days.
[01:47:33.168 --> 01:47:36.890]  The rest of the time, we're wasting money on a person just running around,
[01:47:37.330 --> 01:47:38.751]  And bullshitting, quite frankly.
[01:47:38.791 --> 01:47:40.473]  Just saying nothing and doing nothing.
[01:47:40.873 --> 01:47:46.017]  Whether it's Obama, whether it's Bush Jr., whether it's Clinton, whether it's any other president.
[01:47:46.117 --> 01:47:47.218]  So we don't really need it.
[01:47:47.278 --> 01:47:53.303]  We have to go back to our founding Christian fathers like George Washington, who was very leery of having a president.
[01:47:53.483 --> 01:47:56.586]  Secondly, the Congress has to be disbanded, reoriented.
[01:47:57.046 --> 01:48:00.029]  Along with the Senate, because that's nothing more than a welfare state.
[01:48:00.409 --> 01:48:03.132]  Number three, I'm very disappointed in our military.
[01:48:03.272 --> 01:48:11.199]  From my point of view, our military, professional military, is nothing more than a fanciful communist system where we take care of them from cradle to grave.
[01:48:11.639 --> 01:48:13.441]  Very few of them have ever been in combat.
[01:48:13.501 --> 01:48:15.543]  If they've been in combat, they show leadership.
[01:48:15.843 --> 01:48:17.424]  They never go up to the generalship.
[01:48:17.524 --> 01:48:19.086]  And the generals and the admirals
[01:48:19.486 --> 01:48:28.809]  Then we go become executives at SAIC, CACI, or Northrop Grumman, and they waste our money.
[01:48:28.869 --> 01:48:30.990]  So we're constantly wasting our money.
[01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:33.030]  Our CIA is worthless.
[01:48:33.070 --> 01:48:34.831]  We have to completely get rid of it.
[01:48:35.151 --> 01:48:37.352]  We have 16 intelligence organizations.
[01:48:37.392 --> 01:48:38.152]  We don't need them.
[01:48:38.212 --> 01:48:39.352]  They haven't been effective.
[01:48:39.712 --> 01:48:41.293]  They have done absolutely nothing.
[01:48:41.693 --> 01:48:44.354]  Then we get back to the three branches of government.
[01:48:44.474 --> 01:48:48.316]  Now we get John Roberts, whom I do not respect at the Supreme Court.
[01:48:48.616 --> 01:48:57.360]  This is an individual who's supposed to be Christian, yet he made one of the most stupid, illogical decisions that a corporation has the freedom of speech.
[01:48:57.420 --> 01:48:58.300]  He was paid off.
[01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:00.521]  I can assure you he was paid off.
[01:49:00.941 --> 01:49:05.363]  I can assure you he has a questionable background as a Supreme Court Justice.
[01:49:05.683 --> 01:49:09.205]  He was appointed by nobody else but the most stupidest
[01:49:13.732 --> 01:49:22.437]  Well that's why the establishment got rid of him is because he wanted to be president and they didn't want somebody acting like president.
[01:49:22.457 --> 01:49:22.857]  I agree with that.
[01:49:22.877 --> 01:49:23.898]  Let me ask you this question then.
[01:49:25.307 --> 01:49:38.171]  Looking at where this is going, I mean, I know the military at the top sold out, but when it comes to the enlisted, the non-commissioned officers, and even low-level commissioned officers, they're some of the most professional, informed people, and they listen to this show.
[01:49:38.571 --> 01:49:41.852]  Almost everyone I talk to in the military on the street is a listener.
[01:49:41.912 --> 01:49:43.633]  I'm not bragging, it's actually pretty scary.
[01:49:43.673 --> 01:49:49.935]  No, I agree with you, and I want to address them personally, because I have repeatedly, for three years, asked for the
[01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:54.343]  With his resignation of General Shinseki, I knew he was incompetent.
[01:49:54.784 --> 01:49:56.725]  I knew he couldn't run the VA.
[01:49:56.886 --> 01:50:01.410]  And if I'm saying this to my VA veterans, and I'm a veteran, that he has to go.
[01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:08.095]  But he was so obstinate, so arrogant, and so incompetent that he remained there until men died.
[01:50:08.115 --> 01:50:14.341]  Now, I'm saying this to our military at the captain level, the lieutenant level, and the lieutenant colonel level.
[01:50:14.421 --> 01:50:17.584]  You will never have a chance to get promoted in a system
[01:50:17.964 --> 01:50:18.885]  We're good to go.
[01:50:33.596 --> 01:50:36.158]  Automatically, just like George Marshall did.
[01:50:36.499 --> 01:50:46.347]  So when we go back to the history of where we were the greatest, we had men who came in and dared to defy the system, dared to say to the generals, you're not qualified.
[01:50:46.367 --> 01:50:49.169]  Well, in the old days, most of the generals were combat vets.
[01:50:49.229 --> 01:50:51.151]  Now, I looked it up, most of them had never even been in combat.
[01:50:51.752 --> 01:50:54.935]  Well, even the ones who were in combat vet, they had very little combat.
[01:50:55.015 --> 01:50:57.356]  I mean, Petraeus never really had combat vet.
[01:50:57.397 --> 01:51:04.002]  With all due respect to him, he was shot at a shooting gallery and then promoted himself all the way to the top.
[01:51:04.402 --> 01:51:09.066]  I think for all generals, there are other four-star generals that the NSA never saw combat.
[01:51:09.842 --> 01:51:11.863]  30 hours in Iraq is not combat.
[01:51:12.223 --> 01:51:13.923]  And I'm not talking about just combat.
[01:51:14.023 --> 01:51:20.825]  I'm talking about understanding the strategy, the tactics of war, and what is our national security interest, and how do you manipulate it.
[01:51:21.185 --> 01:51:29.887]  Now, one of our military or intelligence officers really get trained in psychological warfare, psychological determination, group dynamics.
[01:51:29.987 --> 01:51:38.409]  So now that they're going to have to confront China, I have a whole commander of the Pacific who has to deal with problems with China becoming the number one power.
[01:51:38.789 --> 01:51:44.611]  By the way, China next week will be the number one gross economic country in the world.
[01:51:44.651 --> 01:51:46.911]  We have become the number two.
[01:51:47.492 --> 01:51:55.534]  And China will now determine the four structures of where they will go in Southeast Asia, where they will deal with Iran,
[01:51:56.014 --> 01:51:57.796]  Where they will go in Saudi Arabia.
[01:51:58.136 --> 01:52:02.039]  They have international connections to Africa, which we don't.
[01:52:02.439 --> 01:52:04.501]  But they don't care about human rights.
[01:52:04.561 --> 01:52:11.427]  What they care about is expansionism of money and power and they are becoming extremely influential.
[01:52:11.827 --> 01:52:16.051]  There will be a point of confrontation now that I've never said before with China.
[01:52:16.231 --> 01:52:24.017]  Well yeah, I mean, I'm not romanticizing Japan, but it looks like China is the one pushing it, saying, we'll take islands, we're prepared for war.
[01:52:24.037 --> 01:52:28.721]  Do you think they might actually try to take some of those islands, or take Philippine islands?
[01:52:29.485 --> 01:52:30.445]  Yes, I think.
[01:52:30.525 --> 01:52:31.326]  Here's the issue.
[01:52:31.426 --> 01:52:46.310]  When I wrote about Pax Pacifica and some of us wrote in the Op Center books about North Korea and the Chinese episode, I think we have another book coming out with George Galdarisi and Dick Couch about the ongoing Chinese situation after out of the ashes.
[01:52:46.410 --> 01:52:51.152]  Basically, what we're saying now is China will be the dominant force in Southeast Asia.
[01:52:51.172 --> 01:52:55.033]  They will dominate Vietnam, Philippines, Taiwan, Indonesia.
[01:52:55.573 --> 01:52:56.734]  We're good to go.
[01:53:14.941 --> 01:53:33.836]  In Obama, in the Bush family, what we need are people who've had real experiences and can come on the line and we have military officers now who have to deal with China in a negotiated way, also limit setting, and at the same time be able to confront what the Chinese call the cabbage strategy.
[01:53:34.236 --> 01:53:41.862]  The cabbage strategy is to lay in all kinds of boats and patrol boats around the Spratly Islands, the Paracel Islands.
[01:53:42.303 --> 01:53:42.683]  Why?
[01:53:42.843 --> 01:53:43.884]  Because there's oil.
[01:53:44.384 --> 01:54:02.130]  The most important point of oil in the Southeast Asia is around these small Paracels, Bratly Islands, and it's been there for over 20 to 30 years, and there will be a confrontation between the Chinese and the Vietnam, and it's occurred over the past four or five days.
[01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:09.653]  I wrote about it 20 years ago, I predicted it would happen, and I will predict that China will keep pushing and pushing until it gets to the
[01:54:09.873 --> 01:54:10.874]  Putin can only go so far.
[01:54:10.894 --> 01:54:11.756]  Putin is now hurting.
[01:54:11.796 --> 01:54:13.338]  We're hemorrhaging him economically.
[01:54:13.798 --> 01:54:14.799]  The ruble will go down.
[01:54:24.761 --> 01:54:26.603]  On rating went down to a junk bond.
[01:54:26.663 --> 01:54:29.245]  Basically, Putin is now the king of the junk bond.
[01:54:29.865 --> 01:54:31.386]  Ukraine is a dead asset.
[01:54:31.406 --> 01:54:36.289]  There will be no value to us in terms of going to war or doing anything in the Ukraine.
[01:54:36.330 --> 01:54:37.831]  There will be no civil war.
[01:54:37.851 --> 01:54:40.953]  Crimea does belong to Russia.
[01:54:41.073 --> 01:54:45.196]  It fought for it, lost over a million men in the Crimean War, lost 300,000 in battle.
[01:54:47.017 --> 01:54:51.619]  The British lost $100,000, the Turks lost $100,000, but it belongs to Russia.
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:56.282]  The rest of Ukraine he can have because it's a $15 billion debt asset.
[01:54:56.602 --> 01:55:02.345]  There's no money available, the Ukrainians have not developed anything, and they will have to make their own determination.
[01:55:02.385 --> 01:55:07.088]  The West Ukraine government is totally useless, and Victoria Highland can
[01:55:08.598 --> 01:55:26.363]  Nuland can be the one who should be indicted for creating agitation propaganda as well as John... I can't believe, exactly, I can't believe that they openly give speeches saying they spent five billion dollars on the country and I can't believe they talk on telephones not knowing the Russians are recording it.
[01:55:26.763 --> 01:55:28.924]  What is... I mean they literally act like idiots.
[01:55:30.199 --> 01:55:33.120]  Well, not only an idiot, that's called agitation propaganda.
[01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:42.983]  That's why the CIA, which I think he really works for, and John Kerry, whose father worked for the CIA, I think he's nothing more than a tactical, kind of, I think, moron.
[01:55:43.143 --> 01:55:45.624]  Oh, you think they knew the Russians were listening and put it on?
[01:55:46.977 --> 01:56:06.683]  Alex, you know exactly, when she said fuck you to the European Union, she basically knew that she wanted it picked up, because NSIE, we monitor, we not I, but they monitor, the NSA monitors, the Russians monitor, everybody monitors, and she did that purposely as part of education propaganda.
[01:56:07.003 --> 01:56:11.544]  It's a stupid tactic, it was a stupid strategy, and now we're paying a heavy price.
[01:56:11.644 --> 01:56:15.345]  But I agree with you, Putin doesn't want the rest of it, because there's no assets there,
[01:56:17.260 --> 01:56:18.866]  $15 billion debt asset.
[01:56:19.543 --> 01:56:20.684]  He can't do anything with it.
[01:56:20.764 --> 01:56:21.745]  He doesn't really want it.
[01:56:21.805 --> 01:56:25.848]  But Soros wants it to say, oh look, Europe's all screwed up.
[01:56:25.888 --> 01:56:28.770]  Give us trillions more as a banker bailout cover.
[01:56:29.170 --> 01:56:33.854]  Dr. Steve Pachinik, I really enjoyed you coming on StevePachinik.com.
[01:56:33.874 --> 01:56:40.759]  The new book that you co-authored or developed with Tom Clancy is coming out, Out of the Ashes, and we'll have you back again soon.
[01:56:40.799 --> 01:56:42.461]  I really appreciate you coming on the broadcast.
[01:56:42.481 --> 01:56:43.341]  Thank you, everybody.
[01:56:43.561 --> 01:56:44.502]  Thank you always, Alex.
[01:56:44.782 --> 01:56:45.583]  Thank you so much.
[01:56:45.623 --> 01:56:46.504]  I appreciate you joining us.
[01:56:46.564 --> 01:56:47.404]  Okay, he's gone.
[01:56:49.244 --> 01:56:50.965]  That was a pretty straight up interview he just gave us.
[01:56:51.085 --> 01:56:54.967]  I agree with pretty much everything he said from the perspective of the establishment.
[01:56:56.488 --> 01:56:58.169]  But what he's saying is really true.
[01:56:58.209 --> 01:57:01.992]  The New World Order is like a bunch of corporate interests getting away with everything.
[01:57:03.313 --> 01:57:13.419]  They have diplomatic immunity and are above the law and don't get taxed and then avoid taxation and then lobby to have people that stay here as taxes raised.
[01:57:13.919 --> 01:57:15.280]  That will destroy the country!
[01:57:18.124 --> 01:57:21.247]  They don't care about stability, they don't care about their kids, nothing!
[01:57:22.328 --> 01:57:24.009]  You people are out of control!
[01:57:24.029 --> 01:57:36.381]  I mean, it's crazy to realize that there's a New World Order computerized grid and a surveillance system, but it's all a bunch of crooks dialing into it, just running around looting.
[01:57:36.441 --> 01:57:37.702]  It's just, it's crazy town.
[01:57:38.523 --> 01:57:42.946]  It's like the globalists run the New World Order, but they're like German barbarians looting Rome.
[01:57:43.908 --> 01:57:48.150]  And I don't even like Rome, but I live here, and they're running around looting everything.
[01:57:48.610 --> 01:57:50.651]  Where are they going to go once the whole thing burns down?
[01:57:51.552 --> 01:57:54.713]  We should try to fix it, back out of it, have a moral society.
[01:57:55.834 --> 01:58:05.118]  Not burn it all to the ground, running around stealing everything, and teaching kids 2 plus 2 equals 5, because you're a bunch of social eugenicists that hate everything.
[01:58:05.299 --> 01:58:06.739]  It's crazy town, folks, is what it is.
[01:58:07.860 --> 01:58:10.121]  It really is crazy town, and
[01:58:12.020 --> 01:58:13.641]  All I want is stability and to have a future.
[01:58:13.661 --> 01:58:15.682]  And you people want to wreck everything.
[01:58:15.722 --> 01:58:16.763]  I'm talking to the establishment.
[01:58:16.943 --> 01:58:17.463]  You're nuts!
[01:58:18.944 --> 01:58:20.865]  And I'll say the average military person's awake.
[01:58:21.425 --> 01:58:21.845]  That's good.
[01:58:22.326 --> 01:58:24.487]  But the general staff are a bunch of scum.
[01:58:26.673 --> 01:58:28.614]  And they'll sell out to anybody, just like the Vichy French.
[01:58:29.134 --> 01:58:30.394]  Please support this broadcast.
[01:58:30.414 --> 01:58:31.374]  Spread the word about it.
[01:58:32.155 --> 01:58:33.495]  Tell your friends and family about it.
[01:58:34.015 --> 01:58:39.597]  Buy the books, the videos, the t-shirts, all of it at InfowarsStore.com to help fund our operation to continue it and expand it.
[01:58:39.797 --> 01:58:40.797]  Thank you all for your support.
[01:58:40.817 --> 01:58:41.598]  Third hour coming up.
[01:58:41.878 --> 01:58:42.758]  I'll give the number out.
[01:58:43.018 --> 01:58:43.818]  A bunch of calls.
[01:58:43.978 --> 01:58:44.778]  A ton of news.
[01:58:45.059 --> 01:58:46.159]  Covering the waterfront.
[01:58:46.459 --> 01:58:47.239]  Straight ahead.
[01:58:47.259 --> 01:58:48.340]  Hour number three.
[01:58:50.460 --> 01:58:51.561]  Nightly news tonight, seven.
[01:58:51.581 --> 01:58:53.501]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:53.641 --> 01:58:54.741]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:55.082 --> 01:58:55.882]  Share your memberships.
[01:58:59.753 --> 01:59:03.754]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:59:03.794 --> 01:59:07.915]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:59:08.155 --> 01:59:11.576]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:59:11.816 --> 01:59:14.697]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:59:14.877 --> 01:59:22.199]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:59:22.419 --> 01:59:26.060]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:59:26.340 --> 01:59:30.581]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:59:30.761 --> 01:59:36.683]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:59:36.723 --> 01:59:40.503]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:59:40.663 --> 01:59:43.224]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:59:43.404 --> 01:59:44.744]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:59:44.904 --> 01:59:46.145]  It's time to take action.
[01:59:46.265 --> 01:59:47.985]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:00:02.516 --> 02:00:04.458]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:04.919 --> 02:00:07.622]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:14.454 --> 02:00:18.617]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:19.278 --> 02:00:20.079]  You want answers?
[02:00:20.859 --> 02:00:21.780]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:26.023]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:26.604 --> 02:00:30.687]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.927 --> 02:00:37.773]  Alright, I want your take on the fact that it's just a public secret that Boku Haram is a CIA globalist find.
[02:00:38.453 --> 02:00:41.596]  So here's Hillary that protected him and didn't put him on a terror watch list or
[02:00:42.596 --> 02:00:44.558]  A terror designation to stop money getting to them.
[02:00:45.258 --> 02:00:48.060]  It's set up right when Obama gets in office as part of destabilizing Africa.
[02:00:49.341 --> 02:00:50.442]  What is your take on that?
[02:00:50.842 --> 02:00:52.403]  And we'll take a lot of your phone calls.
[02:00:53.124 --> 02:00:56.706]  I'd like to hear from military, especially that's been in AFRICOM and seen any of this.
[02:00:57.067 --> 02:00:59.408]  But you're compartmentalized, I know, but now you can see the big picture.
[02:00:59.428 --> 02:01:00.329]  You probably already saw it.
[02:01:00.569 --> 02:01:02.410]  You saw the Obama deception out six years ago.
[02:01:02.450 --> 02:01:04.172]  It all came true.
[02:01:04.192 --> 02:01:05.192]  800-259-9231.
[02:01:06.093 --> 02:01:08.295]  That film, free online.
[02:01:08.315 --> 02:01:11.537]  You can also buy the DVD to have a higher quality copy and that can't be censored.
[02:01:13.712 --> 02:01:18.154]  It's got 14 million views on one channel, 5 million on another, 8 million on another.
[02:01:18.414 --> 02:01:23.176]  Before Google took it down, it was on Google Video 6 years ago, they still had that.
[02:01:23.456 --> 02:01:25.857]  It had more than 30 million views just on that one channel.
[02:01:25.917 --> 02:01:26.977]  So I haven't done the math.
[02:01:27.938 --> 02:01:28.438]  60 million views?
[02:01:28.478 --> 02:01:28.798]  I don't know.
[02:01:29.539 --> 02:01:31.819]  You can buy the DVD at mfolwarrestore.com.
[02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:33.240]  Just to have it in your collection.
[02:01:34.921 --> 02:01:36.181]  That's good because they take the web down.
[02:01:36.221 --> 02:01:42.344]  You watch it and people keep saying, this film's better now and more important than it was 6 years ago.
[02:01:43.579 --> 02:01:48.002]  Came out in 2009 in March because all of it came true.
[02:01:49.203 --> 02:01:51.704]  And that's why I haven't released Obama Deception 2 as an update.
[02:01:54.486 --> 02:02:00.790]  I don't want to say it's become obsolete because I've taken three years to make it, but it's just always evolving and I just don't know what to do.
[02:02:00.870 --> 02:02:02.071]  There's so much.
[02:02:05.513 --> 02:02:06.694]  I just can't put out crap.
[02:02:07.675 --> 02:02:08.435]  And it's not crap.
[02:02:08.935 --> 02:02:10.877]  It's just that I want to put out something really good.
[02:02:12.093 --> 02:02:15.274]  But I'm just so busy, I don't have time to film make, and I just don't know what to do.
[02:02:16.334 --> 02:02:19.195]  Because we've got a great film already, but I want to update it and add a bunch of stuff.
[02:02:19.215 --> 02:02:19.896]  It's just crazy.
[02:02:21.356 --> 02:02:22.216]  It's all just crazy.
[02:02:24.217 --> 02:02:25.317]  But think about freedom.
[02:02:26.478 --> 02:02:34.381]  That I could make a film, that Infowars could make a film, that's been seen more than 55 million times that I know of.
[02:02:34.401 --> 02:02:36.241]  55 million times.
[02:02:36.261 --> 02:02:37.402]  55 million.
[02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:49.682]  Most people I don't think watched it twice, so let's say it's been seen by 30 million people.
[02:02:51.043 --> 02:02:52.704]  That scares the establishment.
[02:02:54.065 --> 02:02:57.107]  And I was watching MSNBC and CNN this morning on an elliptical.
[02:03:00.188 --> 02:03:02.430]  I was reading the text, I wasn't listening to it.
[02:03:03.499 --> 02:03:15.588]  And it was just, I recognize all these former White House people were the host and the guest, and it's all about how they want to be movie stars and narcissists, and they love being on air, but no one's watching them!
[02:03:15.889 --> 02:03:22.234]  It's little pinhead, grimy nobodies, full of baloney, with no honor, that no one wants to follow.
[02:03:22.254 --> 02:03:24.375]  I mean, you people are a joke!
[02:03:24.615 --> 02:03:27.698]  You could put scantily clad women on there, like Fox, and do better.
[02:03:30.751 --> 02:03:36.494]  But, you know, we are ruled over by these people because they've inherited the big centralized government, the centralized system.
[02:03:36.874 --> 02:03:38.175]  But they really are a joke.
[02:03:39.975 --> 02:03:42.797]  And it's important to realize that they're just all jokes.
[02:03:42.817 --> 02:03:54.662]  I mean, all the women's magazines, I see at the grocery store, everywhere, at the dentist's office, whatever, is how everything, Hillary's a movie star, and really, Michelle and Hillary and all them want to be like movie stars.
[02:03:54.682 --> 02:03:59.845]  They want to go, and the public thinks this is real, it's just all a bunch of soft people.
[02:04:02.014 --> 02:04:03.956]  America has smoked its own dope.
[02:04:05.457 --> 02:04:07.338]  America has drunk its own propaganda.
[02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:13.403]  It's time to stick our finger down our collective throat, vomit it up, and get the poison out.
[02:04:13.423 --> 02:04:14.724]  800-259-9231 800-259-9231
[02:04:21.616 --> 02:04:23.637]  First time, long time, whatever, we're gonna take your calls.
[02:04:23.677 --> 02:04:28.640]  Just all I ask is have a good phone, and when I say your name and go to you, you'll hear the phone system go pshhh.
[02:04:29.201 --> 02:04:30.882]  That means you're on, and just make your point.
[02:04:30.902 --> 02:04:33.123]  I'm gonna try to move the next person.
[02:04:33.143 --> 02:04:34.544]  800-259-9231.
[02:04:34.944 --> 02:04:38.326]  We've got a bunch of other stuff.
[02:04:38.346 --> 02:04:40.047]  Hagel, we missed VA problems.
[02:04:40.668 --> 02:04:42.889]  They missed him at secret death lists to not give him treatment.
[02:04:45.717 --> 02:04:49.478]  We've also got more on, is Mexican food racist?
[02:04:49.518 --> 02:04:51.678]  No, no, no, I'm not saying Mexicans are racist or Mexican food is not.
[02:04:52.118 --> 02:04:53.779]  Is it racist if you eat Mexican food?
[02:04:53.799 --> 02:04:58.000]  And I think the answer obviously is, they're banning it everywhere for white people.
[02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:00.960]  Because it's a racist action for white people to eat Mexican food.
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:01.540]  I'm not joking.
[02:05:01.941 --> 02:05:03.821]  All you can eat taco bars deemed offensive.
[02:05:04.161 --> 02:05:05.321]  Face campus extinction.
[02:05:05.681 --> 02:05:06.162]  We'll be back.
[02:05:06.742 --> 02:05:07.802]  That sounds like a free country, huh?
[02:05:09.716 --> 02:05:18.726]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best-tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:05:18.806 --> 02:05:27.055]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:05:27.215 --> 02:05:31.880]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:05:32.080 --> 02:05:38.785]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:05:38.865 --> 02:05:45.951]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:05:46.051 --> 02:05:52.916]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:05:53.076 --> 02:05:57.419]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:05:57.559 --> 02:06:00.782]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:06:00.922 --> 02:06:07.045]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great-tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:06:07.225 --> 02:06:09.466]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:10.106 --> 02:06:17.989]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[02:06:18.229 --> 02:06:20.190]  All the major networks are state-run.
[02:06:20.450 --> 02:06:23.072]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[02:06:23.152 --> 02:06:27.556]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[02:06:27.596 --> 02:06:30.738]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[02:06:30.758 --> 02:06:38.044]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[02:06:38.224 --> 02:06:42.347]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[02:06:42.527 --> 02:06:44.229]  We are the true media.
[02:06:44.329 --> 02:06:46.931]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[02:06:46.991 --> 02:06:50.655]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.

[02:07:09.807 --> 02:07:20.209]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:07:20.489 --> 02:07:22.350]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:07:22.550 --> 02:07:23.250]  Fluoride!
[02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:25.010]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:07:25.351 --> 02:07:31.672]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:07:31.912 --> 02:07:36.716]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[02:07:36.856 --> 02:07:42.941]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:07:43.161 --> 02:07:45.283]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[02:07:45.603 --> 02:07:48.225]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[02:07:48.525 --> 02:07:51.908]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[02:07:52.028 --> 02:07:56.611]  You will find survival shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:57.452 --> 02:08:02.255]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[02:08:03.736 --> 02:08:06.618]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:08:27.626 --> 02:08:32.087]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:08:32.667 --> 02:08:34.167]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:36.428 --> 02:08:41.549]  Yeah, I played this earlier in the broadcast today, but I thought we'd play it again.
[02:08:41.869 --> 02:08:45.030]  Because it fits into this headline.
[02:08:45.170 --> 02:08:45.510]  U.S.
[02:08:45.550 --> 02:08:48.350]  to conduct strategic bomber exercise.
[02:08:48.370 --> 02:08:54.131]  Nuclear drills follow massive Russian war games last week.
[02:08:54.852 --> 02:08:56.072]  Referendum results.
[02:08:57.262 --> 02:09:00.604]  In Lunsk and other regions show landslide support for self-rule.
[02:09:02.105 --> 02:09:03.026]  What does the U.S.
[02:09:03.066 --> 02:09:04.326]  government want in Ukraine?
[02:09:04.366 --> 02:09:05.027]  Well, it's not the U.S.
[02:09:05.067 --> 02:09:09.990]  government, it's the globalists sock-puppeting our nation towards destabilization and war.
[02:09:10.330 --> 02:09:17.154]  Here's some of the breaking news up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:09:17.294 --> 02:09:18.335]  Very important article.
[02:09:18.695 --> 02:09:22.238]  Greenwald's come out, says NSA intercepts computer hardware.
[02:09:23.251 --> 02:09:27.993]  Yeah, you could have heard that on my show in 1996.
[02:09:28.693 --> 02:09:44.598]  We documented with engineers that when the hardware is being shipped, it's being added in, or they pay them to do it at the factories, or they now have it where they can energize the chips, even when your computer's not plugged into a wall or on, and steal the data out of the capacitors that turn the computer on.
[02:09:46.659 --> 02:09:47.499]  Did you hear what I just said?
[02:09:48.919 --> 02:09:50.040]  We're breaking all of this.
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:55.043]  But now Greenwald, why he's telling us, because he has Snowden.
[02:09:55.924 --> 02:09:56.044]  U.S.
[02:09:56.064 --> 02:10:00.286]  government tampers with routers before factory scaling and sending them out.
[02:10:00.787 --> 02:10:10.313]  In fact, this is, I should get Buckley Hammond in here, my cousin, who worked at a major silicon chip maker back when we were both in college and out of it.
[02:10:10.953 --> 02:10:16.377]  And he described these guys would come in with guns and everything and watch them with the bunny suits when they would make
[02:10:17.117 --> 02:10:20.560]  Secret chips, and they didn't even know what the chips were.
[02:10:21.481 --> 02:10:23.242]  They were having them add stuff, you name it.
[02:10:23.743 --> 02:10:25.104]  I mean, this is just such a joke.
[02:10:25.164 --> 02:10:27.266]  But oh, there's no illegal spying going on.
[02:10:27.306 --> 02:10:28.427]  It's just routed into everything.
[02:10:28.747 --> 02:10:30.849]  So there's the new article up on InfoWars.com.
[02:10:31.770 --> 02:10:35.052]  Indiana gets new military helicopters for homeland security missions, close quote.
[02:10:36.493 --> 02:10:44.961]  The Lakotas, manufactured by Airbus Group, will also aid state and local federal law enforcement agencies in case of an emergency.
[02:10:46.107 --> 02:10:48.050]  The UH-72 Lakota.
[02:10:48.330 --> 02:10:50.333]  There's unlimited helicopters and unlimited money.
[02:10:51.175 --> 02:10:57.404]  Again, you've got to pay higher taxes or you're mean and hateful and racist, but they will take your house if you don't pay the taxes.
[02:10:58.385 --> 02:10:59.808]  But stealing from people, that's good.
[02:11:01.803 --> 02:11:02.844]  Boko Haram, the I.M.
[02:11:02.864 --> 02:11:04.426]  of the globalist designs on Nigeria.
[02:11:04.446 --> 02:11:05.948]  Very important article by Kurt Nemo.
[02:11:06.388 --> 02:11:08.871]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:11:08.991 --> 02:11:16.179]  An extremely important article that we've tweeted out at Real Alex Jones and I hope everyone gets and passes on to friends and family.
[02:11:17.617 --> 02:11:35.131]  And media sources, you name it, is that Mexico, of all places, the citizens have gotten guns out of the U.S., not the ones that Obama shipped down there to trace back and blame drug violence on the Second Amendment, but guns that Mexicans got, mainly deer rifles, you name it, to protect themselves against the drug cartels.
[02:11:35.611 --> 02:11:44.999]  Even the AP had to admit in an article we covered yesterday, and it's in this article, that crime rates have dropped, order's been restored, the people are being hailed, and are getting support rising for them.
[02:11:45.279 --> 02:11:49.502]  And none of it will be perfect, but it just shows arming the general public's the way to go.
[02:11:50.023 --> 02:11:50.923]  It's linked in red.
[02:11:50.943 --> 02:11:55.627]  The headline is, 1776 worldwide, the second amendment comes to Mexico.
[02:11:56.347 --> 02:12:00.631]  Mexican citizens defy gun ban in order to defend themselves against violent criminals.
[02:12:01.071 --> 02:12:04.774]  And then there is the edited, you know, trimmed down for brevity.
[02:12:06.175 --> 02:12:17.468]  First 45 minutes of the show down to 18 minutes, Mexico planning to legalize guns, and they're moving towards, okay, you can have guns, because the people just legally used them and did whatever they wanted.
[02:12:19.010 --> 02:12:21.012]  And without compliance, government can do nothing.
[02:12:22.294 --> 02:12:24.256]  It's kind of like the illegals here in the U.S.
[02:12:24.336 --> 02:12:25.698]  They've always just done whatever they want.
[02:12:26.553 --> 02:12:29.854]  So the government just goes ahead now and tries to make them voters and lets them do whatever they want.
[02:12:30.214 --> 02:12:34.316]  Meanwhile, US citizens, I don't care if you're black, white, Hispanic, comply with everything.
[02:12:34.336 --> 02:12:35.777]  We're known as big, fat, stupid chumps.
[02:12:36.537 --> 02:12:40.058]  It is time to stop complying when government is out of line.
[02:12:40.278 --> 02:12:41.659]  That's what jury nullification is.
[02:12:41.959 --> 02:12:43.400]  You judge the facts and the law.
[02:12:44.260 --> 02:12:46.961]  I mean, look, you know, if somebody rapes and kills a guy's daughter,
[02:12:48.687 --> 02:12:53.248]  And, you know, that's the time to kill fiction is based on real accounts of, you know, composite of things that happened.
[02:12:53.788 --> 02:13:00.390]  Somebody rapes and kills your daughter or whatever, and they let the guy off that did it, and you saw him do it, you know they did it, kill him!
[02:13:01.690 --> 02:13:04.371]  I mean, that's, that's, that's the precept, that's the idea.
[02:13:04.651 --> 02:13:13.133]  And then the jury now sees a dad in the, in the docks there, about to be given prison time for killing somebody that raped and killed her daughter.
[02:13:13.393 --> 02:13:14.393]  The jury says not guilty!
[02:13:15.984 --> 02:13:16.765]  Crime of passion.
[02:13:17.445 --> 02:13:18.706]  We are the boss.
[02:13:18.826 --> 02:13:19.687]  We are the people.
[02:13:19.867 --> 02:13:20.287]  Our will.
[02:13:20.768 --> 02:13:21.849]  Not the establishment.
[02:13:23.070 --> 02:13:23.990]  We will have guns.
[02:13:24.371 --> 02:13:25.432]  We will have private property.
[02:13:25.532 --> 02:13:26.472]  Our children are ours.
[02:13:30.015 --> 02:13:30.656]  We're sick of it.
[02:13:30.896 --> 02:13:36.560]  But we've been taught to let everything else tell us what to do, so we don't know how to navigate the world like domesticated animals that don't know how to find food.
[02:13:37.281 --> 02:13:39.243]  We have to have the animating contest of liberty.
[02:13:39.623 --> 02:13:40.584]  So please get that article.
[02:13:41.678 --> 02:13:43.059]  Off of InfoWars.com.
[02:13:43.759 --> 02:13:46.521]  Get it out to your friends, your family, everybody.
[02:14:12.307 --> 02:14:18.210]  You need them to attack stuff so you can take America's rights and build an army who claims for Al-Qaeda, but it's really for the American people.
[02:14:18.970 --> 02:14:22.712]  And then again, Bill Maher shocks, says Islam is the problem.
[02:14:23.192 --> 02:14:26.493]  Doesn't point out Obama and the globalists are running in radical Islam.
[02:14:26.853 --> 02:14:36.358]  Now I said I want to take your calls on Ukraine, Africa, military industrial complex, terrorism, the VA situation, whatever you want to talk about 800-259-9231.
[02:14:40.728 --> 02:14:42.389]  Tim, in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:14:42.669 --> 02:14:42.969]  Thank you.
[02:14:44.850 --> 02:14:45.871]  Yes, good morning, Alex.
[02:14:46.111 --> 02:14:47.712]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:14:48.552 --> 02:14:51.794]  I want to speak on the African situation and tie it in with Ukraine.
[02:14:52.414 --> 02:14:58.258]  At the outside of the program, you talked about them playing nations against each other.
[02:14:58.618 --> 02:15:02.440]  It's worse than that, and it's more complicated than that, I believe.
[02:15:02.660 --> 02:15:04.981]  They're playing regional blocks against each other.
[02:15:05.602 --> 02:15:08.023]  In Africa, there was an article just last Friday
[02:15:08.604 --> 02:15:09.724]  No, no, no, that's it.
[02:15:09.744 --> 02:15:13.786]  You bring in the terrorists as a way to create the regional globalist AFRICOM control system.
[02:15:13.806 --> 02:15:14.066]  No, exactly.
[02:15:29.341 --> 02:15:38.286]  Now, as far as Ukraine is concerned, Alex, I've made the video blockhead that was the finalist in your video contest last year.
[02:15:38.466 --> 02:15:52.073]  That wasn't a technological masterpiece, but I want to thank you for that contest because it allowed me to, motivated me to, assemble some facts that make me conclude that this region building is what they're up to.
[02:15:53.514 --> 02:15:57.596]  I know, I wish sometime you could re-examine Henry Kissinger's
[02:15:58.254 --> 02:16:04.280]  Famous or infamous New York Times op-ed from 2009, The Chance for a New World Order.
[02:16:04.500 --> 02:16:04.761]  Oh yeah.
[02:16:05.401 --> 02:16:09.766]  In that article Kissinger wrote that this order would come about in either one of two ways.
[02:16:10.487 --> 02:16:29.340]  Either the world would accept what he called an international political regulatory system, or by constructing the size of the political jurisdictions in more manageable regional units, which he said would likely be brought about in a new mercantilism of competing regional units.
[02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:41.189]  Alex, I know you're a student of history, and you know that... They use mercantilism to only let you produce certain things, so you're dependent on the other group to give you the others, and the globalists manage that as a referee.
[02:16:41.489 --> 02:16:52.358]  That's the global control over the modern mercantile system, and I've called the New World Order the modern mercantile system, where only licensed, authorized groups can be involved in commerce.
[02:16:52.858 --> 02:16:54.600]  Everyone else is controlled by taxes.
[02:16:55.340 --> 02:16:56.740]  America was under mercantilism.
[02:16:56.800 --> 02:16:58.201]  That's what George Washington hated.
[02:16:58.581 --> 02:17:01.902]  And yes, Gaddafi was giving the oil wealth.
[02:17:02.422 --> 02:17:05.643]  I'm not romanticizing him, but compared to these guys, he was a good guy at the end.
[02:17:06.083 --> 02:17:10.324]  He was actually trying to create a real African Union to actually help Africa.
[02:17:10.784 --> 02:17:12.124]  And that was not going to be allowed.
[02:17:12.425 --> 02:17:16.986]  So this is part of a destabilization where they bring in the different forces.
[02:17:17.006 --> 02:17:17.806]  You're absolutely correct.
[02:17:18.660 --> 02:17:21.062]  The key to that is what mercantilism did.
[02:17:21.102 --> 02:17:34.191]  The main characteristic of mercantilism was a consolidation of central control within each empire in order to counter the perceived threats or the conceived threats from the other empires.
[02:17:34.671 --> 02:17:37.852]  And that's exactly what they're doing in order to form these regions.
[02:18:05.047 --> 02:18:06.209]  A little better quality.
[02:18:06.409 --> 02:18:08.191]  I redid Blockheads, by the way.
[02:18:08.211 --> 02:18:09.912]  A little better sound thing.
[02:18:10.333 --> 02:18:13.276]  I'd appreciate it if I could... Sure, sure.
[02:18:13.316 --> 02:18:17.039]  What's the exact headline on YouTube so we can pull up your Blockheads video?
[02:18:17.680 --> 02:18:24.287]  Okay, the new one is called Kissinger, World Order, and the New Cold War.
[02:18:25.276 --> 02:18:29.319]  Kissinger, World Order, and the New Cold War, and what was the original blockhead called?
[02:18:29.399 --> 02:18:30.600]  Full, full headline.
[02:18:30.660 --> 02:18:33.102]  Blockheads, Builders of the New World Order.
[02:18:33.362 --> 02:18:34.963]  Blockheads, Builders of the New World Order.
[02:18:35.664 --> 02:18:39.727]  Absolutely, when you read Kissinger's writings, when you read Brzezinski's, it's all public!
[02:18:40.307 --> 02:18:48.669]  I mean, like I keep saying, the White House science czar wrote a book the year I was born saying we're going to put fluoride in the water to brain damage people.
[02:18:48.709 --> 02:18:50.269]  I mean, it's not my opinion.
[02:18:51.310 --> 02:18:52.070]  Eco-science.
[02:18:52.130 --> 02:18:58.631]  I mean, what is it like for you, who's a smart guy, so you spend time researching it, you know this is real.
[02:18:58.651 --> 02:19:01.992]  I mean, it's just crazy to watch him doing this.
[02:19:02.612 --> 02:19:04.693]  Well, it's just the same as you, Alex.
[02:19:04.753 --> 02:19:09.894]  Trying to tell people this, and they deny it, but won't look at the material.
[02:19:10.464 --> 02:19:13.048]  And I think that's probably the most frustrating of all.
[02:19:13.068 --> 02:19:13.649]  It is.
[02:19:15.694 --> 02:19:16.234]  Thank you, Tim.
[02:19:16.275 --> 02:19:17.015]  I appreciate your call.

[02:22:08.815 --> 02:22:09.796]  Attention America!
[02:22:10.136 --> 02:22:17.279]  Within a little-known government document is devastating information that could cost the United States its most valuable asset.
[02:22:17.739 --> 02:22:21.121]  My name is Jeff Opdycke, former reporter for the Wall Street Journal.
[02:22:21.141 --> 02:22:29.905]  I've uncovered shocking evidence within the details of document FT-900, revealing the largest cover-up of President Obama's career.
[02:22:30.306 --> 02:22:33.367]  This will have a substantial impact on our nation.
[02:22:33.807 --> 02:22:36.949]  Millions of Americans will fall into poverty overnight.
[02:22:37.469 --> 02:22:44.376]  A recent report from the Treasury Department said an event of this nature has, quote, the potential to be catastrophic.
[02:22:44.816 --> 02:22:54.305]  Within a matter of weeks, the way of life for millions of Americans will be destroyed, and the standard of living will be like nothing this country has seen in nearly a century.
[02:22:54.705 --> 02:22:58.429]  To learn how you can protect yourself and your family from this government attack,

[02:24:24.381 --> 02:24:26.621]  I got a bunch of clips I haven't played that I want to comment on.
[02:24:26.661 --> 02:24:28.082]  We'll do that after we take some more calls.
[02:24:29.342 --> 02:24:31.182]  Common Core opponents slammed as extremists.
[02:24:31.202 --> 02:24:32.743]  That's the new thing, that you're basically terrorists.
[02:24:33.603 --> 02:24:35.463]  If you don't like 2 plus 2 equals 5, of course.
[02:24:35.523 --> 02:24:39.044]  I mean, O'Brien tortured Winston in 1984 because he thought it was meant for.
[02:24:40.304 --> 02:24:44.225]  A Harvard petition opposes a sacred black mass.
[02:24:44.285 --> 02:24:45.065]  We're going to get into that.
[02:24:46.245 --> 02:24:47.446]  And a bunch of other clips.
[02:24:47.786 --> 02:24:49.526]  Schumer attacks the First Amendment.
[02:24:50.700 --> 02:24:54.083]  Senator Schumer, he's talking about a new First Amendment where you keep your mouth shut.
[02:24:55.084 --> 02:24:55.925]  Because he's liberal.
[02:24:56.845 --> 02:24:59.067]  That's why he wants to take your rights away, because that's liberal.
[02:25:00.749 --> 02:25:03.091]  Let's go ahead and talk to Zach in Wisconsin.
[02:25:03.111 --> 02:25:04.392]  You're on the air, thanks for calling.
[02:25:05.573 --> 02:25:10.838]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to talk about how the military-industrial conflict and these big bankers
[02:25:11.345 --> 02:25:13.206]  We'll go and overthrow a country's government.
[02:25:13.226 --> 02:25:15.086]  That's a little bit corrupt, you know, not perfect.
[02:25:15.567 --> 02:25:17.147]  And they'll promise equality and welfare.
[02:25:17.167 --> 02:25:22.169]  Well, it's kind of friendly, though, when they blow up your country and put Al-Qaeda in to sexually mutilate women and put bags on their heads.
[02:25:22.209 --> 02:25:22.729]  I mean, come on.
[02:25:23.309 --> 02:25:24.190]  Don't be racist, sir.
[02:25:25.450 --> 02:25:29.732]  Yeah, and then they'll go and then they'll make laws making everyone equally oppressed.
[02:25:29.752 --> 02:25:32.193]  And then the people think, oh, at least we're all getting treated the same.
[02:25:32.213 --> 02:25:33.373]  We're all equally oppressed.
[02:25:34.008 --> 02:25:41.393]  But then the elite go and make themselves exempt from all the laws and the country ends up being worse off before when it had its old government in power.
[02:25:42.994 --> 02:25:44.655]  No, that's exactly what's going on.
[02:25:44.695 --> 02:25:45.696]  And then here's the best part.
[02:25:45.876 --> 02:25:56.403]  We end up paying for it and getting the blame when the average American has been under mind control with television for more than 50 years and doesn't know how to find their behind with both hands.
[02:25:57.403 --> 02:25:58.704]  So that's what's so frustrating.
[02:25:58.744 --> 02:25:59.725]  I appreciate your call, Zach.
[02:26:00.165 --> 02:26:01.646]  Let's talk to Nick in Virginia.
[02:26:01.666 --> 02:26:02.487]  Nick, you're on the air.
[02:26:04.042 --> 02:26:05.163]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[02:26:05.663 --> 02:26:06.724]  Oh, worldwide transmission.
[02:26:07.804 --> 02:26:11.386]  I just want to talk about Obama Deception 2.
[02:26:11.846 --> 02:26:12.607]  How's that going?
[02:26:13.067 --> 02:26:14.288]  You know, I could have put it out a year ago.
[02:26:14.308 --> 02:26:15.408]  I could have put it out six months ago.
[02:26:15.468 --> 02:26:16.989]  I just keep updating it.
[02:26:17.009 --> 02:26:18.070]  There's so much to cover.
[02:26:18.890 --> 02:26:19.350]  Who knows?
[02:26:20.411 --> 02:26:22.512]  If I release it, it'll be in the early fall.
[02:26:23.633 --> 02:26:27.115]  I mean, I've got to release it.
[02:26:27.135 --> 02:26:28.796]  I've just had so much going on.
[02:26:28.816 --> 02:26:31.917]  I mean, you could take some time off, man.
[02:26:31.957 --> 02:26:32.658]  You're a busy guy.
[02:26:33.598 --> 02:26:35.078]  Take time off to make the film.
[02:26:35.098 --> 02:26:37.319]  Yes, that's a vacation, let me tell you.
[02:26:37.679 --> 02:26:39.880]  Only do the Sunday show.
[02:26:41.640 --> 02:26:46.901]  You know, I already, maybe once a month or so, that's taped or I have a night in here.
[02:26:47.481 --> 02:26:50.062]  I did take some Sunday shows off months ago trying to work on that film.
[02:26:50.702 --> 02:26:51.362]  I hear you, buddy.
[02:26:51.962 --> 02:26:53.443]  Listen, I need other people to make films.
[02:26:54.483 --> 02:26:57.264]  I'd like to find filmmakers that I could produce films, you know.
[02:26:57.624 --> 02:27:00.144]  I got a lot of plans, it's just that I can only do so much.
[02:27:01.805 --> 02:27:02.445]  Great day, man.
[02:27:03.899 --> 02:27:04.279]  What'd you say?
[02:27:06.221 --> 02:27:07.261]  Oh, have a great day, thank you.
[02:27:07.602 --> 02:27:08.622]  Sorry, his audio was low.
[02:27:08.962 --> 02:27:09.323]  Thank you.
[02:27:10.123 --> 02:27:13.365]  John in New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:27:13.385 --> 02:27:15.727]  Good afternoon, thank you for taking my call.
[02:27:15.747 --> 02:27:17.848]  I have two questions, please.
[02:27:18.569 --> 02:27:27.215]  First, there have been news reports lately that the CIA and the Pentagon supports and protects pedophiles in Afghanistan.
[02:27:29.052 --> 02:27:33.877]  For example, I was watching this program called TCT Television with Bill Federer.
[02:27:34.318 --> 02:27:43.067]  He said he spoke to returning veterans who told him personally that they were forced to protect these pedophiles because they were our allies.
[02:27:43.407 --> 02:27:44.549]  Do you know anything about that?
[02:27:45.851 --> 02:27:50.476]  Well, I mean, I know that some of the Muslim extremists over there have sex with, like, 13-year-old girls.
[02:27:51.797 --> 02:27:58.123]  But, I mean, you know, I'm not even endorsing it, but a hundred years ago or so, people got married at 13 in this country.
[02:27:58.724 --> 02:28:03.688]  So, there's giant sex trade going on worldwide of underage people that I'm totally against.
[02:28:06.491 --> 02:28:13.455]  I'm not for criminalization of prostitution, because all that does is let the state run it, the pimps run it, and makes it dirty like the drug war.
[02:28:13.475 --> 02:28:17.757]  I don't support drugs, but I want to decriminalize the drug war because it makes more drugs be on the streets.
[02:28:18.137 --> 02:28:19.358]  You know, it's that same idea.
[02:28:20.259 --> 02:28:24.381]  But yeah, Afghanistan is a giant, no-bid contract, black hole.
[02:28:25.731 --> 02:28:28.192]  Where they can engage in every form of evil you can imagine.
[02:28:28.212 --> 02:28:35.575]  And I know the troops have been told, you know, help them grow the opium and, you know, let them conscript 14-year-olds into war and everything else.
[02:28:35.615 --> 02:28:39.777]  So, I don't know about the name you mentioned, but I'm vaguely familiar with the story.
[02:28:41.097 --> 02:28:47.900]  These are, um, but these are, they rape boys and the Taliban, to their credit, would execute pedophiles.
[02:28:48.405 --> 02:28:54.768]  And the Wall Street Journal has a reporter on it, even 60 Minutes, this fellow, Henry Hinkrompton.
[02:28:54.828 --> 02:29:11.016]  You know, I mean, all this 60 Minutes stuff, they usually have some cause celeb, Tony 2012, oh, somebody's protecting, I mean, the UN runs giant child kidnapping rings, so, I don't really watch a lot of mainstream television, so I've answered your question, I'm not familiar specifically with what you're saying, thank you.
[02:29:11.696 --> 02:29:14.077]  Let's go ahead and talk to Miles in Florida.
[02:29:14.457 --> 02:29:15.618]  Miles, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:29:16.792 --> 02:29:18.512]  Hey Alex, just calling in, man.
[02:29:18.532 --> 02:29:21.593]  I wanted to let you know what's going on down here in South Florida.
[02:29:21.653 --> 02:29:23.533]  This place is totally done for.
[02:29:23.653 --> 02:29:27.734]  I suggest any patriots that live down here, go ahead and start getting ready to hit the road.
[02:29:28.174 --> 02:29:36.956]  They have these Haitians, these Cubans coming in here by like, I don't know if they're coming in by like super busloads or whatever, but they're flooding every single job.
[02:29:37.516 --> 02:29:41.537]  And you go in there, myself, I try to get a job, I have to speak Spanish.
[02:29:41.597 --> 02:29:43.317]  And they blatantly tell me, you know,
[02:29:43.937 --> 02:29:44.978]  Do you speak Spanish?
[02:29:45.058 --> 02:29:45.918]  How good is your Spanish?
[02:29:45.958 --> 02:29:47.319]  I'm getting tested on my Spanish.
[02:29:47.359 --> 02:29:49.060]  No, I've talked to chefs in L.A.
[02:29:49.860 --> 02:29:51.621]  If you don't speak Spanish, you don't get a job.
[02:29:52.121 --> 02:29:57.184]  They're flooding the country with third world populations.
[02:29:57.204 --> 02:29:58.064]  I'm going to come back to you.
[02:29:58.124 --> 02:29:58.404]  Hold on.
[02:29:58.925 --> 02:29:59.825]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.325 --> 02:30:01.926]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.847 --> 02:30:05.528]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.614 --> 02:30:14.177]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:30:14.337 --> 02:30:17.299]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:30:17.459 --> 02:30:22.683]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:30:23.023 --> 02:30:24.664]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:30:24.944 --> 02:30:26.205]  We are what we eat.
[02:30:26.565 --> 02:30:30.909]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:30:31.250 --> 02:30:35.254]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:30:35.474 --> 02:30:37.816]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:30:38.036 --> 02:30:43.962]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:31:09.612 --> 02:31:16.714]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:31:16.874 --> 02:31:19.036]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:31:19.216 --> 02:31:24.420]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:31:24.580 --> 02:31:29.704]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:31:29.824 --> 02:31:32.926]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:31:33.206 --> 02:31:37.129]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:31:37.349 --> 02:31:41.653]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:31:41.733 --> 02:31:51.900]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:31:52.101 --> 02:31:56.464]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.

[02:32:09.052 --> 02:32:12.954]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[02:32:13.054 --> 02:32:15.295]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:32:15.475 --> 02:32:26.140]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs after consulting top doctors, nutritionists,
[02:32:26.300 --> 02:32:40.228]  Pharmacist and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:32:40.368 --> 02:32:48.012]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:32:48.412 --> 02:32:55.756]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose for a limited time

[02:33:11.905 --> 02:33:13.286]  Zack, this is Crystal Palace.
[02:33:13.426 --> 02:33:13.546]  Inc.
[02:33:13.586 --> 02:33:15.528]  NORAD has declared DEFCON 3.
[02:33:15.568 --> 02:33:16.868]  Scramble all alert aircraft.
[02:33:17.409 --> 02:33:19.170]  I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.
[02:33:20.868 --> 02:33:24.809]  The Whopper spends all its time thinking about World War III.
[02:33:25.349 --> 02:33:26.810]  Target selection complete.
[02:33:26.870 --> 02:33:28.710]  Time-on-target sequence complete.
[02:33:28.730 --> 02:33:35.612]  22 Typhoon-class submarines departing Petropavlovsk, turning southbound at Nordkapp, bearing 095 degrees.
[02:33:35.912 --> 02:33:41.234]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan Air Defense Zone.
[02:33:41.774 --> 02:33:48.095]  From the front lines of the Information War... Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode.
[02:33:48.195 --> 02:33:49.556]  We are at DEFCON 1.
[02:33:51.974 --> 02:33:54.256]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[02:33:54.276 --> 02:33:55.297]  You betcha!
[02:33:55.377 --> 02:33:59.542]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:33:59.702 --> 02:34:02.645]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[02:34:03.246 --> 02:34:06.450]  3... 2... 1... Impact!
[02:34:08.112 --> 02:34:10.014]  Shall we play a game?
[02:34:10.214 --> 02:34:10.775]  How about...
[02:34:16.090 --> 02:34:20.613]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:34:20.933 --> 02:34:22.954]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready.
[02:34:23.234 --> 02:34:24.455]  Awaiting launch codes.
[02:34:24.815 --> 02:34:25.976]  We are on a launch mode.
[02:34:26.436 --> 02:34:29.878]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[02:34:30.358 --> 02:34:34.301]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:34:34.741 --> 02:34:35.081]  We're in!
[02:34:36.242 --> 02:34:37.943]  Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[02:34:38.003 --> 02:34:40.104]  We have a Soviet submarine launch detection.
[02:34:40.544 --> 02:34:42.145]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[02:34:42.586 --> 02:34:49.091]  I wish I was like everybody else.
[02:34:50.252 --> 02:34:51.073]  A strange game.
[02:34:51.133 --> 02:34:52.875]  The only way to win is not to play.
[02:34:53.255 --> 02:34:55.397]  Going right back to your phone calls, miles in Florida.
[02:34:55.957 --> 02:34:58.920]  They politically correct, you know, make it about, oh, you're bashing immigrants.
[02:34:58.960 --> 02:35:00.741]  Well, can I move to their country and get everything free?
[02:35:02.162 --> 02:35:03.123]  Or get subsidized?
[02:35:04.845 --> 02:35:05.765]  It's like Walmart.
[02:35:05.845 --> 02:35:08.688]  I mean, I know it's designed to drive down wages and take over the country.
[02:35:11.513 --> 02:35:12.534]  It's not designed to compete.
[02:35:12.614 --> 02:35:13.875]  It's designed to create monopolies.
[02:35:15.436 --> 02:35:17.778]  I'm not racist against anybody because I don't like Walmart.
[02:35:20.621 --> 02:35:22.983]  And it's the same thing with all of these immigrants.
[02:35:23.383 --> 02:35:31.430]  The most low-skilled, the criminals, the dregs, just pouring in everywhere, pouring in, pouring in, pouring in.
[02:35:33.692 --> 02:35:35.354]  So they'll then vote to take my guns.
[02:35:37.452 --> 02:35:41.335]  I mean, one thing, like scientists were pouring in, or people that contributed something.
[02:35:41.676 --> 02:35:43.777]  And of course, there are some good immigrants, but they didn't come here legal.
[02:35:45.179 --> 02:35:49.582]  And yeah, everywhere I go, it's just swamped with poor people from the third world.
[02:35:51.344 --> 02:35:55.187]  There are 7 billion people, roughly.
[02:35:56.608 --> 02:36:00.231]  Well, 7.5 billion plus worldwide, but I don't know, 650 million or so.
[02:36:03.854 --> 02:36:05.476]  If you count Russia and
[02:36:07.537 --> 02:36:11.940]  Western Europe and the US, I guess that's about 600 and something million.
[02:36:12.581 --> 02:36:13.501]  Westerners count.
[02:36:13.662 --> 02:36:15.623]  Australia, a few other countries, 700 million.
[02:36:17.064 --> 02:36:17.524]  Japan.
[02:36:19.666 --> 02:36:23.289]  But the point is, let's say there's 700 million, 800 million people, I don't know.
[02:36:24.069 --> 02:36:27.392]  It's below a billion that live
[02:36:28.800 --> 02:36:38.089]  In First World Nations, then you've got six plus billion, more than six and a half, almost seven billion people that want to come here.
[02:36:39.391 --> 02:36:40.051]  Over six billion.
[02:36:42.454 --> 02:36:49.461]  And it's a very simple equation, bring in the illegals, drive down wages, dumb the population down, the people are coming from poor countries with no education.
[02:36:50.871 --> 02:36:59.554]  And it's game over for the establishment using our, quote, democracy so that people can out-vote and make the indigenous population slaves.
[02:36:59.955 --> 02:37:04.796]  Well, in a republic, your action against individuals is blocked even if you have a majority.
[02:37:06.277 --> 02:37:08.638]  The majority vote to make black people slaves again.
[02:37:08.658 --> 02:37:09.818]  I'm sorry, you can't do that.
[02:37:10.699 --> 02:37:13.100]  The majority vote to take my guns or take my property.
[02:37:13.120 --> 02:37:13.640]  You can't do that.
[02:37:13.900 --> 02:37:16.601]  But it's been happening because they're democratizing us.
[02:37:17.161 --> 02:37:18.041]  But finish your point.
[02:37:18.141 --> 02:37:19.042]  I know that Florida
[02:37:20.396 --> 02:37:22.257]  In many areas, looks like a war zone.
[02:37:23.258 --> 02:37:24.559]  But the Midwest looks like that.
[02:37:24.579 --> 02:37:26.741]  I mean, I drive all over this country, and it's rough.
[02:37:27.481 --> 02:37:30.903]  Dallas used to be a booming city, and I've been up there.
[02:37:30.964 --> 02:37:36.227]  It looks worn at the edges, and this country's having its wealth sucked out of it.
[02:37:37.068 --> 02:37:40.270]  Go ahead, Miles, finish your point.
[02:37:41.331 --> 02:37:45.474]  Well, Alex, I just wanted to say, man, besides the illegals that are, I mean, not illegals,
[02:37:46.232 --> 02:37:48.093]  You know, whatever they are, immigrants that are coming here.
[02:37:49.254 --> 02:37:50.995]  It's flooded with trendies as well.
[02:37:51.316 --> 02:37:52.196]  So it's the both of them.
[02:37:52.236 --> 02:37:57.840]  It's trendies and them together, you know, against pretty much anyone who thinks like a normal person.
[02:37:58.620 --> 02:38:01.082]  And I can't even hold down a job.
[02:38:01.162 --> 02:38:05.045]  I'm getting I have to quit because these people make me go crazy working with them.
[02:38:05.812 --> 02:38:08.595]  Uh, what they'll do, they'll pretty much do anything for a dollar.
[02:38:08.635 --> 02:38:10.037]  They, all they want is overtime.
[02:38:10.237 --> 02:38:12.539]  They don't care about their hourly wage going up or anything.
[02:38:12.700 --> 02:38:13.721]  They just want overtime.
[02:38:13.761 --> 02:38:15.583]  They want to work 60, 70 hours.
[02:38:15.843 --> 02:38:16.584]  The more the better.
[02:38:16.604 --> 02:38:17.385]  They don't need to go home.
[02:38:17.425 --> 02:38:18.406]  They'll sleep in their car.
[02:38:19.275 --> 02:38:20.716]  So, it's crazy down here.
[02:38:20.736 --> 02:38:27.261]  I started a YouTube channel like you said to do, and I started putting out videos talking about it, and people are liking it.
[02:38:27.281 --> 02:38:29.883]  I've got some subscribers, and you know, you were right.
[02:38:29.903 --> 02:38:34.166]  It does make you feel better to do it, and once you join the fight, you start to feel better.
[02:38:34.186 --> 02:38:35.427]  So, I want to thank you for that.
[02:38:35.607 --> 02:38:36.107]  Well, thank you.
[02:38:36.127 --> 02:38:37.168]  Tell folks the website.
[02:38:38.409 --> 02:38:40.871]  It's Trendy Go Boom on YouTube.
[02:38:41.465 --> 02:38:42.486]  Thank you, I appreciate your call.
[02:38:42.526 --> 02:38:46.911]  And folks, you're not trendy if you like to wear a fedora, or you got earrings or tattoos, you know.
[02:38:46.951 --> 02:38:48.072]  If that's your style, great.
[02:38:48.132 --> 02:38:49.613]  Some of it looks good, you know, out there.
[02:38:51.896 --> 02:39:02.066]  The point is, it's like trendies then accept whatever the media's saying and think they are the boss, and think they know everything, and think you're weird if you're wearing a polo shirt, because that's what you like.
[02:39:03.695 --> 02:39:11.446]  I mean, trendies will actually say, ha ha, look, that guy's wearing top-siders and prep shorts, and well, that's what I like to wear.
[02:39:13.373 --> 02:39:22.236]  I mean, they're comfortable shoes, it's the summer, and I like wearing a shirt I can just grab off the rack, primary color, throw it on, not think about it.
[02:39:22.616 --> 02:39:24.316]  I don't think about styling my hair.
[02:39:24.756 --> 02:39:29.118]  I brush my teeth, I comb my hair, 20 seconds of combing my hair, I'm done.
[02:39:29.818 --> 02:39:35.319]  See, I'm about what I believe and what I stand for and who I am, not what I look like necessarily.
[02:39:37.880 --> 02:39:40.501]  I mean, I guarantee you folks, if I put a Misfits shirt on,
[02:39:41.750 --> 02:39:45.812]  And you know, wore like black jeans and like ran around and acted trendy.
[02:39:45.872 --> 02:39:48.253]  I mean, it would be like women running around throwing themselves at me.
[02:39:51.295 --> 02:39:52.816]  That's how the society works.
[02:39:52.876 --> 02:39:53.936]  It shouldn't be what you're wearing.
[02:39:54.157 --> 02:39:56.478]  By the way, I happen to like the Misfits, some of their songs.
[02:39:56.578 --> 02:39:57.378]  I think it's great music.
[02:39:57.738 --> 02:39:59.439]  I just don't wear the t-shirt.
[02:40:01.656 --> 02:40:02.837]  That's what I'm trying to get out of here.
[02:40:02.917 --> 02:40:04.598]  Or like, two socks that aren't the same color.
[02:40:05.119 --> 02:40:06.720]  Or have my hair all bozo'd out.
[02:40:07.540 --> 02:40:08.801]  And then they have no content.
[02:40:08.841 --> 02:40:09.482]  There's nobody there.
[02:40:09.722 --> 02:40:12.344]  If you look weird and then you're smart and cool, that's fine with me then.
[02:40:13.025 --> 02:40:14.926]  Because I'm not offended by how you look.
[02:40:14.986 --> 02:40:18.869]  It's not shocking to me that you look different.
[02:40:19.790 --> 02:40:25.534]  It's that it means, oh, this person may be completely hollow and a fake intellectual.
[02:40:27.796 --> 02:40:28.136]  Oh no.
[02:40:28.837 --> 02:40:29.237]  Not that.
[02:40:31.149 --> 02:40:34.831]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Bob in Michigan.
[02:40:35.311 --> 02:40:36.272]  Bob, you're on the air.
[02:40:36.332 --> 02:40:41.094]  Before I go to Bob, I've known people that go like, hey Alex, you know, you're not cool.
[02:40:41.114 --> 02:40:45.216]  You're not like a rock and roll punk rocker or something, you know, because you don't dress like that.
[02:40:45.236 --> 02:40:46.176]  It's just like, look at these people.
[02:40:46.617 --> 02:40:49.558]  All they have is the possession of how they look.
[02:40:50.338 --> 02:40:51.079]  You know what I have?
[02:40:51.259 --> 02:40:52.399]  I have the fact that I'm honorable.
[02:40:52.499 --> 02:40:53.200]  I study the world.
[02:40:53.220 --> 02:40:53.980]  I know how things work.
[02:40:54.981 --> 02:40:55.461]  See what I'm saying?
[02:40:56.421 --> 02:40:58.362]  And I don't know, maybe I should get a green mohawk or something.
[02:40:58.402 --> 02:40:59.303]  Maybe then I would be cool.
[02:41:01.237 --> 02:41:07.264]  It'd be like the guys that wear cowboy hats but never worked on a ranch or don't know how to use a lariat, a lasso.
[02:41:08.585 --> 02:41:12.810]  I mean, I know how to do a little bit of that stuff, but I wouldn't even call myself a bad cowboy.
[02:41:13.711 --> 02:41:15.694]  And then you see these guys that are all hat and no cattle.
[02:41:15.734 --> 02:41:16.495]  It's kind of the same thing.
[02:41:16.535 --> 02:41:17.556]  It's like dress-up.
[02:41:20.134 --> 02:41:31.662]  I mean, if I've got to go back in the day when I was a kid or high school during the summer and go work for a couple months mending the fences, yeah, I wore a Stetson straw hat then so my face wouldn't burn off.
[02:41:33.483 --> 02:41:34.084]  See what I'm saying?
[02:41:34.124 --> 02:41:42.089]  It's just, I'm not against you want to wear a cowboy hat and go out dancing or whatever, but then those are the people that think they're really tough and cool because they've done that and they've never been on a horse.
[02:41:42.209 --> 02:41:44.651]  You know, it's just kind of, you know, it's the same deal.
[02:41:45.950 --> 02:41:49.512]  Or like all these guys that wear MMA stuff, which they may be great fighters, maybe they're into it.
[02:41:49.532 --> 02:41:50.873]  The point is, it's not against the MAA.
[02:41:50.933 --> 02:41:53.735]  I've gone and seen a lot of, you know, Joe Rogan's my good friend, the host of it.
[02:41:56.137 --> 02:41:56.657]  UFC.
[02:41:57.598 --> 02:42:02.021]  It's just that then, they want to wear that stuff and act like you're scared of them.
[02:42:02.061 --> 02:42:11.948]  It's like, you see these people walking down city streets with pit bulls that are growling at you, and then they'll get real mad when I'll go, hey man, get your dog in line.
[02:42:11.988 --> 02:42:14.570]  They say something and I go, listen, I'm on a really urchy, really bad right now.
[02:42:15.580 --> 02:42:17.021]  I'll start screaming at him, and I can't help it.
[02:42:17.061 --> 02:42:18.521]  And they're going, what's your problem?
[02:42:18.661 --> 02:42:20.522]  And this one guy's big husband got in my face.
[02:42:20.722 --> 02:42:21.782]  I said, go ahead and hit me, man.
[02:42:21.942 --> 02:42:23.623]  I'm going to stomp your butt in the ground right now.
[02:42:23.963 --> 02:42:28.545]  You're German shepherds, yet they have five of them on the green bell off a leash, ran up snapping at me.
[02:42:28.585 --> 02:42:29.965]  And I said, get out of here!
[02:42:29.986 --> 02:42:31.126]  You're supposed to run them off.
[02:42:31.146 --> 02:42:32.006]  The dogs ran back.
[02:42:32.346 --> 02:42:33.527]  And the guy ran up, bowed up.
[02:42:33.567 --> 02:42:35.167]  And I'm like, man, you're in the wrong.
[02:42:35.348 --> 02:42:36.528]  Your dogs almost attacked me.
[02:42:36.708 --> 02:42:38.449]  I'm about to hurt you really bad, buddy.
[02:42:39.485 --> 02:42:42.709]  Let's say you're really tough, you're still about to get in a fight with somebody that's meaner now.
[02:42:43.109 --> 02:42:44.030]  Do you want this fight?
[02:42:44.171 --> 02:42:45.893]  Then back off, you got two seconds!
[02:42:48.816 --> 02:42:52.460]  And that guy might have kicked my butt, but let me tell you, he's gonna get it right back.
[02:42:53.001 --> 02:42:55.044]  He's not gonna walk away unscathed from this.
[02:42:55.584 --> 02:42:57.567]  He'll probably walk away in a coma.
[02:42:58.837 --> 02:43:01.018]  And the whole point is, it's the same thing with the New World Order.
[02:43:01.258 --> 02:43:05.400]  It's all these people that want to push it, push it, push it, push it, push it, push it, push it.
[02:43:05.540 --> 02:43:08.802]  Just pushin' and pushin' and pushin' and pushin' and pushin'.
[02:43:09.402 --> 02:43:10.843]  Pretty soon you're gonna get pushed back.
[02:43:12.964 --> 02:43:15.845]  Man, it happens all the time on the hockey backfield.
[02:43:16.626 --> 02:43:20.528]  This Rottweiler, yesterday, was kinda coming up ground with a guy, and I just wasn't in the mood.
[02:43:20.548 --> 02:43:22.929]  I was like, hi doggy, and pushed it away, and the dog was about to bite me.
[02:43:23.529 --> 02:43:26.371]  And I'm just like, man, you got a mean dog, keep it in your backyard.
[02:43:27.503 --> 02:43:29.684]  You know, I'm not here for your dog to mess with me.
[02:43:29.744 --> 02:43:30.445]  I love dogs!
[02:43:31.205 --> 02:43:32.206]  But I've got a French Bulldog.
[02:43:32.706 --> 02:43:35.108]  You see, I'm not looking to act tough because I've got a mean dog.
[02:43:35.828 --> 02:43:37.669]  I don't own a junkyard I'm trying to guard.
[02:43:37.689 --> 02:43:40.111]  I'm ranting and I apologize.
[02:43:40.351 --> 02:43:41.772]  I just shouldn't go off and digress.
[02:43:43.193 --> 02:43:49.937]  I start flashing back people on their damn dogs and... It's the exact same thing.
[02:43:52.018 --> 02:43:53.780]  They want... It doesn't matter.
[02:43:54.100 --> 02:43:55.661]  Anyways, Bob in Michigan, go ahead.
[02:43:56.755 --> 02:43:57.035]  Hey Alex.
[02:43:57.355 --> 02:43:57.855]  Hey buddy.
[02:43:58.576 --> 02:44:01.917]  The Georgia Guidestones is in eight languages.
[02:44:02.697 --> 02:44:07.439]  With all those immigrants, couldn't you get somebody to speak in those eight languages?
[02:44:08.300 --> 02:44:12.742]  And also the 16 questions for Newtown.
[02:44:14.863 --> 02:44:18.184]  Yeah, is there an article or something?
[02:44:18.204 --> 02:44:20.525]  Because I'm trying to make exactly where you're going with the question.
[02:44:24.346 --> 02:44:29.367]  Yeah, we've sent our crews there twice, and it's in a bunch of languages, but it's in English, so we know what it says.
[02:44:29.988 --> 02:44:31.908]  But, I mean, what are you saying?
[02:44:31.968 --> 02:44:37.670]  We could, like, get people there and, like, do a video where people say in Japanese or whatever?
[02:44:37.690 --> 02:44:39.710]  Yeah, in eight languages, yeah.
[02:44:40.451 --> 02:44:41.751]  And then that way we inform others.
[02:44:41.811 --> 02:44:42.471]  I see what you're saying.
[02:44:43.511 --> 02:44:47.753]  And then, you know, the 16 questions for Newtown, you know?
[02:44:50.293 --> 02:44:51.414]  Well, now, what is that?
[02:44:51.574 --> 02:44:52.314]  I don't know what that is.
[02:44:53.986 --> 02:44:56.287]  I called you a couple of weeks ago on your Sunday show.
[02:44:56.727 --> 02:44:59.028]  Oh, the investigator, his questions, yes.
[02:44:59.348 --> 02:45:01.369]  He was on our nightly news last week as well, yes.
[02:45:01.789 --> 02:45:01.989]  Good.
[02:45:02.729 --> 02:45:03.730]  All right, thank you so much.
[02:45:03.770 --> 02:45:04.530]  Great points, Bob.
[02:45:04.550 --> 02:45:06.491]  Great questions or things that you raise.
[02:45:06.531 --> 02:45:07.651]  I'm just not omnipresent.
[02:45:07.671 --> 02:45:12.973]  People call up and, you know, and like say something and I'm just, explain to me what you're saying.
[02:45:14.053 --> 02:45:16.994]  Common Side Effects is the name of this person from Hawaii.
[02:45:17.194 --> 02:45:18.135]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[02:45:18.763 --> 02:45:19.983]  Hey, go ahead.
[02:45:20.123 --> 02:45:27.245]  Yeah, I just want to first say that I appreciate your show, and I'm a subscriber, and I like the Pollen Bursts a lot.
[02:45:27.705 --> 02:45:28.146]  Thank you.
[02:45:28.206 --> 02:45:31.066]  Yeah, it's really awesome.
[02:45:31.586 --> 02:45:39.309]  For sure, I don't agree with everything you say, but man, what a world if we agreed with everything that everybody said, it would just be ridiculous.
[02:45:39.349 --> 02:45:44.150]  Well, if 10% of what I'm saying is true, we're in crazy town, and believe me, most of what I'm saying is true.
[02:45:44.730 --> 02:45:46.130]  And people say, well, what's a lie then?
[02:45:46.190 --> 02:45:47.791]  No, no, I'm sure I'm wrong about some things.
[02:45:48.251 --> 02:45:52.112]  Yeah, I've been listening to you for a long time and so I think I have a good reference point.
[02:46:08.516 --> 02:46:12.479]  Of what you say and what you stand by and the fruits that you actually bear.
[02:46:12.920 --> 02:46:20.065]  And I was telling the other brethren, I was like, you know, I'm tired of people telling me about this Jew conspiracy thing.
[02:46:20.186 --> 02:46:24.949]  Cause it's like, you know, if somebody can't, if somebody comes to me and say, Oh, it's the Jews.
[02:46:25.110 --> 02:46:27.031]  I'm like, I look at them like they're crazy.
[02:46:27.051 --> 02:46:33.116]  Because first of all, that's so vague, you know, even if it's, it could be true or whatever, it's so vague.
[02:46:33.536 --> 02:46:37.960]  So I'm like, look, man, this man calls out the Rothschilds every time.
[02:46:38.533 --> 02:46:42.514]  And he calls out the other perpetrators of these crimes.
[02:46:42.674 --> 02:46:50.657]  So how can you sit there and tell me that he is holding this conspiracy for the Jews?
[02:46:51.557 --> 02:46:58.640]  And don't you understand how this man is like the tip of the spear in the alternative media?
[02:46:59.020 --> 02:47:03.341]  He can't just come out and say stupid stuff like that, you know?
[02:47:05.583 --> 02:47:17.954]  I just, and there's like a lot of stuff that I don't agree with you about but to you, you come off like a real person to me and right now I know how you speak upon the sincerity of people and
[02:47:18.824 --> 02:47:20.746]  You just, you come off real.
[02:47:21.067 --> 02:47:21.387]  You know?
[02:47:21.407 --> 02:47:22.809]  Well thank you sir, so do you.
[02:47:22.869 --> 02:47:24.831]  Look, all I'm trying to do is get people thinking.
[02:47:25.171 --> 02:47:40.368]  But I'm trying to bring people together so I don't make it and say evil comes from white people or evil comes from black people or evil comes from Asians or evil comes from Jews or evil comes from Christians or the evil comes from the Muslims.
[02:47:40.928 --> 02:47:41.968]  I mean, that's what Bill Maher said.
[02:47:42.008 --> 02:47:43.549]  He said, the evil really is the Muslims.
[02:47:43.569 --> 02:47:44.730]  You know, they really are the problem.
[02:47:45.250 --> 02:47:52.953]  And, you know, my whole issue, meanwhile the CIA is openly running the very group he's talking about, and so they're trying to make Islam like that.
[02:47:52.993 --> 02:47:56.474]  The point is, is that I'm not defending it either, because I'm not a Muslim.
[02:47:56.514 --> 02:48:04.818]  The point is that clearly there's a lot of powerful people that have come out of the Jewish faith, the Jewish genetic system, whatever you want to call it.
[02:48:05.857 --> 02:48:33.629]  and uh... but you know there's a lot of uh... you know powerful asians in engineering as well so yeah i mean there are ethnic mafias involved as italian mafia involved in the world order don't blame all jews because there's a jewish mafia bugsy seagull the whole nine yards i'm really trying to sell liberty and freedom no matter what color you are i mean i've had a lot of jewish friends and have jewish friends that love liberty are super smart nice people and nothing but help me people like aaron russo god rest his soul
[02:48:34.309 --> 02:48:37.631]  And so, you know, you're going to... Jews, on average, I think, are really smart people.
[02:48:38.471 --> 02:48:41.533]  You know, every group has stereotypes, but you're going to have bad Jews, you're going to have good Jews.
[02:48:42.093 --> 02:48:52.959]  And so my whole thing is, Cass Sunstein's a Jew, and he says at the White House, we're going to go out and stir up conspiracy groups along lines, racial lines, religious lines, to play them off against each other.
[02:48:53.199 --> 02:48:53.879]  Well, that's it.
[02:48:54.039 --> 02:48:59.722]  So, you go out, because I'm creating unity, and you say, I work for the Vatican.
[02:49:00.102 --> 02:49:02.944]  Turns out the guy that says that actually pretty much works for Israel.
[02:49:03.704 --> 02:49:05.385]  A certain Israeli groups.
[02:49:05.465 --> 02:49:06.746]  It's not one monolithic group.
[02:49:07.306 --> 02:49:14.730]  And then you've got the FBI white supremacist types like Hal Turner saying I'm Jewish and my family's Jewish and I work for Israel.
[02:49:14.990 --> 02:49:16.571]  Turns out he was a federal officer.
[02:49:17.011 --> 02:49:17.751]  He's in jail now.
[02:49:17.792 --> 02:49:18.312]  They burned him.
[02:49:19.192 --> 02:49:26.839]  And that's all because I was honest and said that my wife's mother, her dad, her grandfather was Jewish, and I'm part Native American.
[02:49:27.040 --> 02:49:34.967]  But I'm an American, I'm a liberty lover, and I don't think that's shameful, you know, that my wife has some Jewish heritage.
[02:49:35.027 --> 02:49:41.332]  And, you know, her family's like nuclear physicists and, you know, classical violinists, some of them, smart people, Harvard doctors, you name it.
[02:49:41.373 --> 02:49:44.876]  But, you know, she's got her, you know, her dad's from like West Texas, wears a cowboy hat.
[02:49:45.296 --> 02:49:47.518]  And as a, you know, as an English name.
[02:49:47.778 --> 02:49:48.938]  It's just, you know, she's a Christian.
[02:49:48.959 --> 02:49:54.862]  And the whole point is, is that, is that, you know, I mean, if they take over and it was a Nazi coup, would, you know, would I be killed?
[02:49:54.902 --> 02:49:55.603]  My kids killed?
[02:49:55.623 --> 02:49:58.185]  Because, because, you know, I have some connection to Jews.
[02:49:58.225 --> 02:50:01.767]  I mean, I don't think there's any Europeans out there that don't have some type of Jewish bloodline.
[02:50:02.087 --> 02:50:11.674]  I don't know that in my genealogy, but I bet it's there somewhere because, you know, I've got so many, you know, different European bloodlines in my bloodline.
[02:50:12.274 --> 02:50:14.776]  The Jews have been in Europe for thousands of years.
[02:50:15.776 --> 02:50:21.257]  They were merchants along with the Romans, and so there have been Jews in Europe for over 2,000 years.
[02:50:22.258 --> 02:50:24.918]  And so, I mean, it's just, you know, they turned out Hitler had some Jewish blood.
[02:50:25.298 --> 02:50:26.078]  That was a big deal.
[02:50:26.979 --> 02:50:29.139]  So I just don't sit there and demonize anybody.
[02:50:29.159 --> 02:50:30.559]  But look, I appreciate your call.
[02:50:31.360 --> 02:50:33.880]  People want to intellectually feel like they've one-upped you.
[02:50:34.980 --> 02:50:39.541]  And so instead of debating what I've done, what I stand for, they just go, I'm morally bigger and better.
[02:50:39.902 --> 02:50:41.662]  Alex Jones is an Israeli agent.
[02:50:42.631 --> 02:50:45.453]  Even though I'm critical of Israel and critical of the things they're doing.
[02:50:46.573 --> 02:50:55.099]  You know, when I criticize a war against Russia, they have neocon groups run by the CIA publicly, publicly, come out and say that I work for Putin.
[02:50:55.119 --> 02:50:55.959]  Well, that's just pure bull.
[02:50:56.419 --> 02:50:57.620]  Don't speak a word of Russian.
[02:50:57.660 --> 02:50:59.661]  I know how to say gulag or buskal.
[02:50:59.741 --> 02:51:01.582]  I guess I can say the word vodka.
[02:51:02.823 --> 02:51:07.706]  I mean, I know the Russian women are beautiful, but I mean, other than that, I'm being accused of working for Putin.
[02:51:07.726 --> 02:51:08.287]  It's pure bull!
[02:51:08.507 --> 02:51:09.087]  It's pure bull!
[02:51:09.648 --> 02:51:10.808]  Hey, this is Steve Sanchez.

[02:54:35.175 --> 02:54:37.277]  We're all
[02:54:45.211 --> 02:54:49.092]  Money Through Fronty, folks.
[02:54:49.152 --> 02:54:49.852]  11am to 2pm.
[02:54:49.992 --> 02:54:52.373]  We're here.
[02:55:14.147 --> 02:55:18.790]  Then we come back 7 o'clock central with InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:55:21.671 --> 02:55:24.173]  Alright, I mentioned this earlier, I want to play it now.
[02:55:24.353 --> 02:55:33.138]  This is Chuckie Schumer two years ago saying there should be limits on C-SPAN in the Senate floor, in the Senate podium about restricting the First Amendment.
[02:55:33.198 --> 02:55:40.442]  Now, Jay Rockefeller has also, we played the clip, said they need to get rid of free speech and we'd be better off without internet.
[02:55:40.802 --> 02:55:42.023]  So here is Chuckie Schumer.
[02:55:43.368 --> 02:55:44.853]  So I believe there ought to be limits.
[02:55:45.796 --> 02:55:48.745]  Because the First Amendment is not absolute.
[02:55:49.667 --> 02:55:50.871]  No amendment is absolute.
[02:55:53.114 --> 02:55:55.935]  You can't scream fire falsely in a crowded theater.
[02:55:55.975 --> 02:55:56.996]  We have libel laws.
[02:55:57.036 --> 02:55:58.697]  We have anti-pornography laws.
[02:55:58.717 --> 02:56:01.898]  Can't be pro-life, we'll censor you and have the IRS come after you.
[02:56:02.478 --> 02:56:03.759]  Yeah, he uses that as fire and theater.
[02:56:03.779 --> 02:56:04.779]  That's a call to action.
[02:56:05.019 --> 02:56:06.100]  That's kill that person.
[02:56:06.860 --> 02:56:07.781]  That's a call to violence.
[02:56:07.961 --> 02:56:09.341]  That's not First Amendment.
[02:56:09.782 --> 02:56:13.103]  That is a call to action totally different and you know it as a lawyer.
[02:56:13.763 --> 02:56:18.986]  Now, let's go to the new piece, a little clip from Fox News about a new First Amendment that Lord Schumer is proposing.
[02:56:19.918 --> 02:56:33.247]  When the Supreme Court or any of my colleagues say that the Koch brothers' First Amendment rights are being deprived, that they're not being heard, it defies common sense.
[02:56:34.268 --> 02:56:35.289]  It defies logic.
[02:56:35.509 --> 02:56:47.297]  The ability to be heard is different than the ability to drown out every other point of view using modern technology simply because you have a lot more money.
[02:56:48.086 --> 02:56:50.908]  By the way, I get zero money from the Koch Brothers.
[02:56:50.928 --> 02:56:54.190]  Until about four or five years ago, I would call them the Kotz Brothers, because I would just read the name.
[02:56:54.610 --> 02:56:55.590]  They fund Bill Clinton.
[02:56:55.610 --> 02:56:57.551]  We've had Greg Paulus, who's a liberal on all of them.
[02:56:57.832 --> 02:56:58.832]  He's an honest liberal, though.
[02:57:00.173 --> 02:57:01.994]  He will tell you the Koch Brothers fund both parties.
[02:57:02.234 --> 02:57:03.335]  They're in a fight with Soros.
[02:57:05.596 --> 02:57:13.861]  And they've been funding some of the mainline Republican Tea Party groups that tried to take over the real Tea Party that Ron Paul started, and that this audience started like eight years ago.
[02:57:15.140 --> 02:57:15.560]  I love it.
[02:57:15.580 --> 02:57:17.482]  People go, oh Alex Jones, you work for the Koch brothers.
[02:57:18.042 --> 02:57:22.665]  And they say it with a satisfaction like I'm a nobody and they're this big moral person.
[02:57:23.005 --> 02:57:23.886]  I work for the Koch brothers.
[02:57:23.906 --> 02:57:24.566]  I work for Israel.
[02:57:24.786 --> 02:57:25.447]  I work for Putin.
[02:57:25.847 --> 02:57:26.647]  I work for the Vatican.
[02:57:26.708 --> 02:57:27.668]  I can't work for them all.
[02:57:28.048 --> 02:57:30.030]  I work for me and liberty and you.
[02:57:30.050 --> 02:57:32.211]  Because if I'm going to be free, you need to be free.
[02:57:33.072 --> 02:57:34.753]  But it just changes the subject.
[02:57:35.113 --> 02:57:36.134]  I'm not running your life.
[02:57:36.414 --> 02:57:38.255]  I'm not signing you on to the trillions in debt.
[02:57:38.615 --> 02:57:42.318]  I'm the one saying General Electric and Google should not be able to escape taxes.
[02:57:43.223 --> 02:57:44.644]  The Koch brothers shouldn't be able to?
[02:57:45.185 --> 02:57:45.965]  Outside the country?
[02:57:46.966 --> 02:57:47.427]  Any of them?
[02:57:50.089 --> 02:57:55.774]  You know, just ignore the work we've got to do and just say, oh, Alex is an agent.
[02:57:57.416 --> 02:58:01.159]  You know, Alex said he'd had some family that worked in, you know, clandestine operations.
[02:58:01.219 --> 02:58:07.905]  Yeah, I told you that on the show to explain that they said the government was corrupt and evil and that I was on the right track.
[02:58:08.345 --> 02:58:08.746]  Duh!
[02:58:08.986 --> 02:58:09.726]  Being honest.
[02:58:10.885 --> 02:58:15.169]  Kinda like I admitted that I've been involved in abortions back when I was a teenager in early college.
[02:58:16.209 --> 02:58:21.134]  I didn't like that it happened, but it happened, and my activity contributed to it, and I apologize, and I repent for it.
[02:58:21.674 --> 02:58:23.716]  I told you that as part of full disclosure!
[02:58:24.616 --> 02:58:26.238]  And I don't care that I'm being criticized.
[02:58:26.258 --> 02:58:28.940]  That's gonna happen when it's like Fight Club everywhere I go.
[02:58:28.960 --> 02:58:30.221]  People are like, yes, Mr. Jones.
[02:58:30.241 --> 02:58:31.602]  I mean, the listenership is huge.
[02:58:31.642 --> 02:58:32.143]  It's incredible.
[02:58:32.743 --> 02:58:33.884]  It's an incredible responsibility.
[02:58:34.124 --> 02:58:36.626]  I'm on the opposite of a power trip, how big this show is.
[02:58:36.987 --> 02:58:42.931]  But I want you out there who aren't government agents to stop being mentally ill and to get past just calling everyone a government agent.
[02:58:43.211 --> 02:58:44.553]  You'll know a government agent.
[02:58:45.473 --> 02:58:47.475]  They'll be promoting 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[02:58:47.535 --> 02:58:50.317]  Alright, doing some overdrive to take your calls.
[02:58:50.737 --> 02:58:52.879]  Be ready, Carl and others.
[02:58:52.979 --> 02:58:54.921]  Carl and Bob and others.
[02:58:54.941 --> 02:58:56.282]  I'm going right to you.
[02:58:56.622 --> 02:58:57.303]  Right to you.
[02:58:57.723 --> 02:58:58.744]  Infowars.com.
[02:58:59.580 --> 02:59:08.563]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:59:08.663 --> 02:59:16.746]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:59:17.046 --> 02:59:21.748]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:59:21.928 --> 02:59:28.631]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:28.711 --> 02:59:35.795]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:59:35.895 --> 02:59:42.758]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:59:42.918 --> 02:59:47.280]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:59:47.400 --> 02:59:50.661]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:59:50.781 --> 02:59:56.923]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.

[03:00:00.444 --> 03:00:01.605]  Coast to Coast.
[03:00:01.985 --> 03:00:03.385]  Direct from Austin.
[03:00:04.025 --> 03:00:07.247]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:14.420 --> 03:00:18.581]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:19.241 --> 03:00:20.042]  You want answers?
[03:00:20.822 --> 03:00:21.722]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:22.362 --> 03:00:26.023]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:26.564 --> 03:00:30.665]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:31.425 --> 03:00:34.506]  We're all living in America.
[03:00:34.886 --> 03:00:36.126]  It's wonderful.
[03:00:36.907 --> 03:00:37.407]  Carl!
[03:00:38.627 --> 03:00:39.687]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[03:00:40.368 --> 03:00:41.508]  Calling from Washington.
[03:00:42.455 --> 03:00:44.996]  Yeah, a couple questions.
[03:00:45.596 --> 03:00:51.517]  First of all, would tequila be considered discriminatory or racist?
[03:00:52.197 --> 03:00:52.797]  Absolutely.
[03:00:53.057 --> 03:00:56.318]  Anybody who's white seen eating tacos on campus is now racist.
[03:00:56.638 --> 03:00:58.878]  They're banning any type of fiesta parties.
[03:00:59.718 --> 03:01:06.540]  Because again, everyone must feel like you're racist, except the UN lining up people and shooting them to take their property and the New York Times reporting on it.
[03:01:06.580 --> 03:01:07.360]  That's a good thing.
[03:01:07.700 --> 03:01:10.001]  Mass murder, death, cancer viruses and vaccines.
[03:01:10.281 --> 03:01:11.981]  Just don't eat tacos or drink tequila.
[03:01:12.779 --> 03:01:13.079]  Yeah.
[03:01:13.420 --> 03:01:14.441]  Is bourbon racist?
[03:01:15.282 --> 03:01:15.562]  It is.
[03:01:15.742 --> 03:01:16.743]  It's against Kentucky.
[03:01:17.204 --> 03:01:17.344]  Oh.
[03:01:17.544 --> 03:01:18.465]  Well, I'm from Kentucky.
[03:01:18.665 --> 03:01:19.406]  Can I drink bourbon?
[03:01:19.886 --> 03:01:22.149]  You can punch me in the nose for just saying the word Kentucky, buddy.
[03:01:22.569 --> 03:01:23.009]  You got it.
[03:01:23.230 --> 03:01:24.471]  Knowledge is racism.
[03:01:24.491 --> 03:01:29.156]  We should all just be, oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:01:29.576 --> 03:01:34.822]  I was wondering, how effective can this be if they find Lois Lerner
[03:01:36.010 --> 03:01:38.492]  Guilty of contempt, but they're not going to arrest her.
[03:01:38.592 --> 03:01:41.214]  Well, Boehner has already said that he's not going to go after her.
[03:01:41.234 --> 03:01:44.776]  The Republicans aren't going to try to have her arrested, so they're just all part of the criminal operation.
[03:01:45.436 --> 03:01:46.817]  They don't care about their kid's future or anything.
[03:01:46.837 --> 03:01:49.880]  They just care about a bigger mansion, more helicopters, and more women.
[03:01:50.400 --> 03:01:53.262]  Well, actually, with the Congress, more guys.
[03:01:53.302 --> 03:01:53.642]  I'm sorry.
[03:01:54.263 --> 03:01:56.204]  Whatever.
[03:01:56.224 --> 03:01:58.025]  And I'm asking for forgiveness.
[03:01:58.565 --> 03:02:01.467]  Am I entitled to one mistake after 35 years?
[03:02:01.688 --> 03:02:03.389]  Am I entitled to one mistake?
[03:02:03.409 --> 03:02:04.610]  It's so fake, man.
[03:02:05.370 --> 03:02:06.831]  I can't even get that off the screen.
[03:02:06.851 --> 03:02:08.472]  I saw that this morning and almost threw up.
[03:02:09.413 --> 03:02:11.875]  I mean, I didn't do anything.
[03:02:11.975 --> 03:02:13.976]  I just thought, I only did one thing.
[03:02:13.996 --> 03:02:15.137]  He's done this like over and over again.
[03:02:15.678 --> 03:02:20.281]  The thing is he runs a PR organization making a franchise he's part of look bad.
[03:02:21.722 --> 03:02:24.364]  But in a way, I guess let him have his team and just don't go to it.
[03:02:24.404 --> 03:02:25.025]  It's free market.
[03:02:25.405 --> 03:02:30.689]  My issue is all you can eat taco bars deemed offensive face campus extinction.
[03:02:31.704 --> 03:02:32.184]  I love it.
[03:02:32.524 --> 03:02:33.745]  This is crazy land.
[03:02:34.185 --> 03:02:35.986]  Bob in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[03:02:36.006 --> 03:02:36.586]  Thanks for holding.
[03:02:36.606 --> 03:02:36.967]  Go ahead.
[03:02:37.507 --> 03:02:42.089]  I just wanted to say I love tacos and I'll eat as many as I want anytime I want.
[03:02:42.429 --> 03:02:50.173]  The thing is this, the total hypocrisy of our administration, our State Department, CIA, everything with this Ukrainian situation.
[03:02:50.574 --> 03:02:57.377]  Now, at first when they're funding these freedom fighters or whatever they want to call them, protesters,
[03:02:57.802 --> 03:03:08.670]  They're protesters, and we got Victoria Nuland out there giving them cookies on the front line, giving them support, and then they overthrow the government using the neo-Nazis for the violence that they do.
[03:03:08.690 --> 03:03:09.570]  Don't be racist!
[03:03:09.670 --> 03:03:13.033]  Obama's behind it, so if you're not for neo-Nazis, you're racist.
[03:03:13.953 --> 03:03:17.536]  It's okay for Obama to fund the group kidnapping the women in Africa.
[03:03:17.936 --> 03:03:19.597]  It's okay for them to fund neo-Nazis.
[03:03:19.837 --> 03:03:21.679]  What's racist is eating tacos.
[03:03:23.183 --> 03:03:38.862]  Listen, but the total hypocrisy of them now, these people in the Eastern Ukraine are predominantly Russian speakers, now they want to bail out from this illegal coup that took place in Kiev, but now everybody's going to call them terrorists.
[03:03:39.142 --> 03:03:42.286]  Oh, they've been calling them terrorists and Nazis when they're the opposite group?
[03:03:42.748 --> 03:03:49.291]  Yeah, but I understand that, but how can our State Department and the administration deal with the hypocrisy?
[03:03:49.351 --> 03:03:50.352]  Have they no shame?
[03:03:50.672 --> 03:03:53.653]  Because they go ahead and... No, no, no, no, they think we're totally stupid.
[03:03:53.693 --> 03:03:54.513]  It's 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[03:03:54.754 --> 03:04:04.018]  I mean, and again, everyone's running around going, I better not have tacos, I'm racist, to think that's the new... to make us all feel guilty, while meanwhile they're funding neo-Nazis.
[03:04:04.038 --> 03:04:04.778]  It's just insane.
[03:04:05.058 --> 03:04:07.539]  James in California, last caller, sorry to BJ and Blake.
[03:04:07.820 --> 03:04:08.420]  Go ahead, James.
[03:04:09.451 --> 03:04:10.791]  Yes, hi Alex.
[03:04:11.091 --> 03:04:11.611]  Hey!
[03:04:11.831 --> 03:04:14.672]  What do you know about synthetic artificial telepathy?
[03:04:15.892 --> 03:04:22.493]  I mean... Yes, synthetic artificial telepathy is what the internet can do, predicting human activities almost 100% of the time.
[03:04:22.513 --> 03:04:26.894]  I mean, look at how Amazon can predict what you're going to order before you order it.
[03:04:28.454 --> 03:04:33.855]  Yeah, well I happen to know some people in Minneapolis that I've known for 30-some years.
[03:04:34.735 --> 03:04:37.616]  And one of them used to be a police officer before he retired.
[03:04:38.496 --> 03:04:42.099]  He came up, he somehow acquired this device.
[03:04:42.760 --> 03:04:46.083]  Somebody else knew in the police force.
[03:04:47.665 --> 03:04:51.028]  And they've been using this on people for years.
[03:04:51.772 --> 03:04:52.673]  Well, do me a favor.
[03:04:52.733 --> 03:04:55.854]  I mean, it was like a high-tech divining rod or something.
[03:04:56.095 --> 03:04:56.615]  Do me a favor.
[03:04:56.655 --> 03:04:58.476]  Send me a letter or send me an email with more details.
[03:04:58.496 --> 03:04:59.197]  I'm sorry I'm out of time.
[03:04:59.537 --> 03:05:01.378]  I'll look up synthetic telepathy device.
[03:05:02.398 --> 03:05:04.520]  Seven o'clock tonight, the news.
[03:05:04.940 --> 03:05:06.461]  It's hardcore, hard-hitting.
[03:05:06.641 --> 03:05:07.622]  Help spread the word.
[03:05:07.722 --> 03:05:08.602]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:05:10.323 --> 03:05:13.745]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's... Information.
[03:05:13.765 --> 03:05:14.806]  Important information.
[03:05:15.066 --> 03:05:19.949]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[03:05:20.189 --> 03:05:21.430]  Several years ago, Matt was
