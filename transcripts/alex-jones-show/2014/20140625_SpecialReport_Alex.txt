[00:00:10.222 --> 00:00:13.026]  Right now we really don't have a lot of domestic terrorists.
[00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.988]  So the FBI is getting bored.
[00:00:15.268 --> 00:00:17.371]  So they're creating bad guys to go after.
[00:00:17.411 --> 00:00:27.404]  It's like Batman and Gotham City running out of the Joker, Two-Face, and then finding someone else and pissing them off and getting them to go out so he has someone to fight.
[00:00:27.544 --> 00:00:29.026]  That's all the FBI is doing right now.
[00:00:29.226 --> 00:00:33.070]  Can the federal government take credit for saving us from a plot of its own creation?
[00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.713]  The FBI has foiled about 17 plots to kill Americans.
[00:00:36.853 --> 00:00:41.097]  The 17 that were interrupted by the feds were created by the feds.
[00:00:41.377 --> 00:00:46.802]  The more curious cases are the remaining 17 for which the federal government has taken credit.
[00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.181]  They all have a common and reprehensible thread.
[00:00:50.621 --> 00:00:55.343]  They were planned, plotted, controlled, and carried out by the federal government itself.
[00:00:55.663 --> 00:00:57.144]  Right now we have the case in Florida.
[00:00:57.184 --> 00:01:00.265]  Marty Winters is a 55-year-old prepper.
[00:01:00.786 --> 00:01:03.907]  It's usually the good family right down the street that you know to.
[00:01:03.927 --> 00:01:08.629]  They go to church every day, hard-working Americans who pay their bills, and really all they're doing is they're just trying to prepare
[00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:11.110]  In case something bad happens, what's wrong with that?
[00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.593]  You know, the way our government's going right now, the way our economy is, it looks like that is a possibility that, you know, everything could collapse.
[00:01:17.954 --> 00:01:19.514]  So what's wrong with being prepared?
[00:01:19.635 --> 00:01:29.720]  Our government wants us to be prepared for a worst case scenario by forcing us to buy Obamacare, but we as Americans can't prepare, we can't go out and buy MREs, we can't have
[00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.233]  You know, water purification devices and stored water, guns and ammunition, just to be on the safe side.
[00:01:36.394 --> 00:01:39.420]  And this man had an FBI agent infiltrate
[00:01:40.373 --> 00:01:48.159]  His River Otter Prepper Group and say that he had 50 AK-47s buried across his properties.
[00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:54.824]  He had a house that was booby-trapped that he would catch on fire and when federal agents showed up, it would kill them.
[00:01:55.264 --> 00:02:01.229]  Now after the search warrant was given, they went in and found five legally registered guns in a safe.
[00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.833]  No huge weapons cache that the FBI informant who was embedded in there said that he had.
[00:02:06.093 --> 00:02:10.256]  And there were no homes out of the properties that he owned that were rigged to blow up.
[00:02:10.556 --> 00:02:14.819]  You know, it wasn't this huge elaborate scheme that the FBI made it out to be.
[00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:23.324]  You know, they just wanted to go after a guy who was a prepper, who wants to preach, and you know, a friendly neighbor guy, and demonize this man.
[00:02:23.784 --> 00:02:24.664]  This is the new normal.
[00:02:24.764 --> 00:02:30.768]  I mean, in a sense, when, you know, you mentioned Qazi Nafis, for example, the man who tried to detonate a bomb at the Federal Reserve Building.
[00:02:30.828 --> 00:02:32.629]  You know, here was a guy who had nothing.
[00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:34.030]  He never had access to any weapons.
[00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.592]  He never had any contact with Al-Qaeda or a terrorist organization.
[00:02:36.732 --> 00:02:44.377]  It was actually an undercover agent who provided everything he needed, provided the bomb, provided the transportation, provided the money, and that allowed him to commit this crime.
[00:02:44.457 --> 00:02:52.103]  What we're seeing more and more in these sting operations is people who are on the fringes, who are desperate, sometimes mentally ill, and they're the ones being caught in these sting operations.
[00:02:52.841 --> 00:02:56.884]  Well, as you can see, the FBI obviously doesn't have our best interests in mind at all.
[00:02:56.944 --> 00:03:02.188]  You know, they have funded almost every single domestic terrorist incident in America.
[00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:09.433]  Underwear bomber, 93 at the Twin Towers or the World Trade Center, when the car bomb went in and blew up and killed some people and injured a lot more.
[00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:18.219]  They have a history of taking these people and taking their simple, small idea that was never going to turn into anything and then give them the money and the weapons to pull it off.
[00:03:24.517 --> 00:03:28.921]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:03:29.221 --> 00:03:31.483]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:03:31.803 --> 00:03:41.492]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
[00:03:41.832 --> 00:03:50.034]  That's why we're rolling out on a 100% made in America line of incredible pro-liberty apparel.
[00:03:50.234 --> 00:03:52.775]  We are re-popularizing liberty.
