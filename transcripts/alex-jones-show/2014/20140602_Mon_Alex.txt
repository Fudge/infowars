[00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:02.671]  Coast to coast.
[00:00:03.051 --> 00:00:04.371]  Direct from Austin.
[00:00:05.112 --> 00:00:08.314]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:14.605 --> 00:00:15.245]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.926 --> 00:00:16.946]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.687 --> 00:00:18.787]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.448 --> 00:00:20.248]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:21.909]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.172]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.772 --> 00:00:30.834]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:52.744]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, June 2nd, 2014.
[00:00:52.784 --> 00:00:59.390]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.574]  I am coming to you from the road with my family.
[00:01:04.234 --> 00:01:18.724]  We are going to have Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, Infowars.com reporter, joining us during the next 45 minutes or so with one of our other reporters, Leanne McAdoo of Infowars Nightly News.
[00:01:19.165 --> 00:01:26.670]  We've got a lot of geopolitical news, a lot of Obama scandal news, more resignation news reportedly coming.
[00:01:27.884 --> 00:01:36.512]  A lot of other situations boiling around the world, but this Bo Bergdahl army story, last week we see it come out that Obama
[00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.961]  has intentionally blown the cover of a CIA asset.
[00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:46.202]  And we'll be breaking down all the names and details with Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs coming up in the next segment.
[00:01:46.882 --> 00:01:52.623]  We see the report that he blows the cover of the CIA asset and is in hot water for that.
[00:01:53.983 --> 00:02:03.165]  And before we find out why this is all going on, Bo Bergdahl, who told members of his army team, I'm going to go AWOL, which is clearly
[00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:13.555]  A cover could be a cover for him to then artificially defect to the Taliban to quote then infiltrate that group.
[00:02:13.635 --> 00:02:24.000]  And we know both groups, Taliban, Al Qaeda, there's two or three different groups of Taliban, different sub factions of Al Qaeda, different sub factions of the CIA, different sub factions in the army.
[00:02:24.321 --> 00:02:26.602]  This is what countries and intelligence agencies do.
[00:02:28.263 --> 00:02:29.746]  The whole thing stinks really bad.
[00:02:30.608 --> 00:02:36.760]  Then you've got a Twitter that appears to be his dad's, operating for years, that came out.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.584]  We'll put that tweet on screen.
[00:02:38.964 --> 00:02:39.846]  We have a Twitter account.
[00:02:41.092 --> 00:02:50.735]  Where his father is talking about there'll be great vengeance, there'll be great payback for every Afghan child that's been killed.
[00:02:51.596 --> 00:02:54.617]  And then his dad gets up on television and starts speaking in Farsi.
[00:02:55.197 --> 00:03:03.160]  Immediately when this started breaking Friday through Saturday, Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs was calling myself and others saying, look, this just doesn't hold water.
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:11.524]  I'd heard about this guy, you know, he said years ago from people that were in his unit saying that something was, you know, going on with him.
[00:03:12.044 --> 00:03:21.369]  And for those that don't know what sheet dipping is, you will stage your death or you'll get out of the military or they'll claim you failed at special forces training like Ed Snowden or Timothy McVeigh.
[00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:27.031]  And then you're put into clandestine operations, which is confirmed now with McVeigh and Snowden.
[00:03:27.351 --> 00:03:28.352]  That's not speculation.
[00:03:28.712 --> 00:03:31.994]  So when you see this M.O., we ought to get Steve Pucinich to pop in.
[00:03:32.594 --> 00:03:34.356]  For 10 minutes today or tomorrow on this.
[00:03:34.396 --> 00:03:40.543]  I was just thinking he's saying that the Snowden situation is a double agent operation.
[00:03:40.864 --> 00:03:45.729]  And then now Snowden comes out and says I was trained as a spy by the CIA and by others.
[00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:48.652]  So we have that report as well.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:04:04.604]  Again, it becomes a larger diversion and a distraction and just a PR stunt by Obama to say, look, I'm bringing our boys home by releasing a whole bunch of top Taliban people out of Gitmo.
[00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:12.827]  So I'm not saying that it is a conspiracy yet, but it's definitely pointing in that direction.
[00:04:13.207 --> 00:04:14.588]  And we should never forget that
[00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:25.018]  This is the same administration that hands down, hands down, staged the release of the death of Bin Laden.
[00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.882]  This is the administration that lied and said the Navy witnessed him being thrown overboard.
[00:04:29.922 --> 00:04:34.185]  Turns out that's not true, and faked the situation from photos and said they were watching live video feeds.
[00:04:34.205 --> 00:04:34.726]  That didn't happen.
[00:04:35.026 --> 00:04:37.088]  I've interviewed the Navy SEALs' families on air.
[00:04:37.408 --> 00:04:43.053]  They even know the name of the Bin Laden look-alike double agent.
[00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:49.626]  I don't have to go back into that whole story of why that was fake.
[00:04:49.646 --> 00:04:51.766]  I meant to cover up the whole birth certificate story.
[00:04:52.126 --> 00:04:54.287]  But this has all the earmarks of a stunt.
[00:04:54.307 --> 00:04:57.928]  We're going to dissect it coming up in the aftermath of Bilderberg 2014.
[00:04:58.628 --> 00:05:00.008]  It was really important.
[00:05:00.928 --> 00:05:03.129]  And just a ton of other vital news today.
[00:05:03.989 --> 00:05:04.429]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.490]  We have some huge guests coming up this week as well.
[00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.070]  It's a big week.
[00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.450]  Stay with us.
[00:05:09.813 --> 00:05:13.815]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:17.997]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:21.638]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:05:21.878 --> 00:05:24.760]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:32.263]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:05:32.483 --> 00:05:36.125]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:05:36.405 --> 00:05:40.647]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:05:40.807 --> 00:05:46.751]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:05:46.791 --> 00:05:50.813]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:05:50.853 --> 00:05:53.254]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:05:53.474 --> 00:05:54.815]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:05:54.975 --> 00:05:56.196]  It's time to take action.
[00:05:56.336 --> 00:05:57.997]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:06:09.846 --> 00:06:16.871]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:06:17.011 --> 00:06:19.172]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:06:19.352 --> 00:06:24.454]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:29.657]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:06:29.797 --> 00:06:32.838]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:06:33.118 --> 00:06:36.981]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:06:37.201 --> 00:06:41.444]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:06:41.524 --> 00:06:51.552]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape, but that we can fight back against.
[00:06:51.752 --> 00:06:54.274]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:06:54.454 --> 00:07:02.520]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.622]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:07:10.626 --> 00:07:12.407]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[00:07:12.948 --> 00:07:19.892]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:30.799]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:40.426]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[00:07:41.146 --> 00:07:44.587]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[00:07:45.227 --> 00:07:48.648]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[00:07:48.988 --> 00:07:50.549]  Experience the new formula.
[00:07:51.049 --> 00:07:53.010]  Experience the ancient purity.
[00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:54.550]  Shield your family.
[00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.331]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:07:56.771 --> 00:07:59.352]  Available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:59.932 --> 00:08:03.893]  X2 from InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:08:19.537 --> 00:08:21.718]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:22.179 --> 00:08:23.940]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:32.202 --> 00:08:44.685]  So much of what we see on the news concerning the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, MI6, different intelligence agencies, doesn't even have to do with the public.
[00:08:45.506 --> 00:08:49.347]  It is different agencies that are basically fighting with each other.
[00:08:50.907 --> 00:08:54.788]  So many times, it turns out that that's really what's going on.
[00:08:56.269 --> 00:09:00.250]  And earlier last week, we had the Washington Times break the story
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.061]  That was then picked up by the other media.
[00:09:03.502 --> 00:09:16.312]  Obama insists on protecting incel sources days after blowing CIA agents cover the head agent in Kabul, in Afghanistan.
[00:09:16.332 --> 00:09:29.083]  Three days after the White House inadvertently blew the cover, yeah right, of the CIA's top officer in Kabul, President Obama on Wednesday said his administration is committed to effective intelligence gathering and protecting sources and methods abroad.
[00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:35.821]  And again, not that this story in and of itself is that important, unless you use it to learn how things really work.
[00:09:37.263 --> 00:09:53.159]  At a first approximation of this, looking at it this weekend, the Beau Bergdahl army story, who's been in captivity for almost five years supposedly, looks like an infiltration operation where you purposefully claim you've defected to the Taliban.
[00:09:55.033 --> 00:09:59.016]  And then they don't trust you, they grab you, and then you're a quasi-prisoner.
[00:09:59.917 --> 00:10:04.240]  And then you act like you've got Stockholm Syndrome, and then you basically join them.
[00:10:05.359 --> 00:10:08.081]  And then you have the dad with his Twitter, reportedly.
[00:10:08.542 --> 00:10:09.562]  It looks like it's his real Twitter.
[00:10:09.602 --> 00:10:18.849]  It's not verified, but it's been operating for years, saying, you know, people will pay for the death of Afghan children and growing a big beard and all the rest of it.
[00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:20.911]  The whole thing stinks to high heaven.
[00:10:20.931 --> 00:10:25.615]  The fact that Obama has him and his wife out there, they wouldn't trot some soldier's dad and mom out.
[00:10:26.235 --> 00:10:28.418]  Unless they absolutely knew who they were and trusted them.
[00:10:28.799 --> 00:10:35.488]  This is the same Obama ran the whole fake Bin Laden death deal that's been proven to be a fraud, hands down, up one side and down the other.
[00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:38.352]  We should probably on the nightly news tonight and then I'll air it tomorrow.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:45.223]  Recap the lies of the Bin Laden raid with the fact that they court-martialed a record number of people on the aircraft carrier.
[00:10:45.463 --> 00:10:46.443]  They said they never saw it.
[00:10:46.703 --> 00:10:58.689]  The Navy SEALs, the families who've been on the show, two different families, saying, no, we know the name of the Bin Laden double lookalike who was killed at the compound, a CIA asset they set up.
[00:10:59.049 --> 00:11:03.291]  Turned out the CIA was running in that whole area, the fake inoculation program.
[00:11:03.511 --> 00:11:04.252]  That was their cover.
[00:11:05.092 --> 00:11:07.293]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, this is ridiculous.
[00:11:07.313 --> 00:11:08.454]  You send Navy SEALs in.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.642]  You literally kill your own double asset bin Laden look-alike.
[00:11:14.262 --> 00:11:17.143]  And then you blow up their helicopter on the ground trying to get rid of them.
[00:11:17.463 --> 00:11:18.604]  The experimental helicopter.
[00:11:18.884 --> 00:11:21.765]  Then you bury the fake body on the ship, but there is no body.
[00:11:22.025 --> 00:11:22.765]  No one sees it.
[00:11:22.966 --> 00:11:25.667]  You put fake photos out claiming their Pentagon leaked.
[00:11:26.547 --> 00:11:27.888]  Fake Situation Room photos.
[00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:29.708]  Fake video feeds that weren't real.
[00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:32.610]  Dr. Steve Pachinik
[00:11:33.664 --> 00:11:35.767]  Who is about the most high-level spy we've ever had on.
[00:11:35.807 --> 00:11:37.890]  I mean he co-wrote the books with Tom Clancy.
[00:11:39.513 --> 00:11:45.602]  He obviously ran the Camp David Accords, helped found Delta Force with General Boykin.
[00:11:48.226 --> 00:11:57.131]  He has run all sorts of clandestine operations, snuck into North Korea last year for us, because he knows the North Koreans, basically got in and then admitted he was there.
[00:11:59.032 --> 00:12:07.176]  He said that was totally staged on my show in 2002, before it came out on CBS News, that bin Laden had been treated at a U.S.
[00:12:07.196 --> 00:12:08.617]  military hospital in Dubai.
[00:12:09.758 --> 00:12:11.098]  He said that before it was in the news.
[00:12:11.539 --> 00:12:17.422]  And after he broke that on our show, also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, high level at the time, until he resigned,
[00:12:18.835 --> 00:12:24.126]  He then came out and basically predicted even more.
[00:12:25.351 --> 00:12:31.374]  And he said this was staged then, that his body was on ice, that they would stage his death later.
[00:12:31.914 --> 00:12:33.375]  Maybe even in a new administration.
[00:12:33.635 --> 00:12:35.316]  And then it all came true, like he said.
[00:12:36.576 --> 00:12:42.639]  So that said, until about 45 after, we're joined by Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, a combat veteran, of course.
[00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:51.543]  Been written about in Esquire magazine for some of the big battles he was in that were covered by the late Michael Hastings, who I believe was probably a
[00:12:53.917 --> 00:13:06.380]  agency asset we don't know which agency but he had the whole cut out of that inside interagency battles probably killed with a car bomb to cover that up told friends and family he was running for his life minutes before his car blew up
[00:13:07.904 --> 00:13:10.046]  And the FBI was investigating and said they weren't.
[00:13:10.166 --> 00:13:18.755]  So again, Michael Hastings, friend, combat veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq, just immediately said things didn't fit Friday and Saturday.
[00:13:18.775 --> 00:13:21.738]  And I said, hold, hold off, stand down.
[00:13:22.239 --> 00:13:23.901]  I don't want to be the first out front on this.
[00:13:24.021 --> 00:13:24.581]  I believe you.
[00:13:25.442 --> 00:13:28.724]  It is coming on the heels of this head CIA asset having their cover blown.
[00:13:29.465 --> 00:13:32.186]  That probably meant that this other guy's got cover blown.
[00:13:32.486 --> 00:13:35.869]  And so they said, OK, we've got to now stage you coming back.
[00:13:36.169 --> 00:13:41.172]  And I've seen this before, where they will have a, quote, al-Qaeda operative and their cover gets blown.
[00:13:41.192 --> 00:13:43.573]  It's really CIA or defense intelligence.
[00:13:43.833 --> 00:13:46.315]  And then they'll quietly release them and change their name.
[00:13:46.675 --> 00:13:48.717]  So this has been done over and over again.
[00:13:48.957 --> 00:13:50.598]  Now, I'm not saying Bo Bergdahl
[00:13:51.278 --> 00:13:56.140]  is a CIA asset or is a defense intelligence asset and this is all staged.
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:01.283]  I'm saying all the pieces and the timing of this points at that.
[00:14:02.284 --> 00:14:05.387]  Now, sometimes things point at something and that's not what it is.
[00:14:05.847 --> 00:14:15.217]  But a bunch of red flashing arrows, you know, like it's a late night diner, are pointing into this thing and we're just analyzing it.
[00:14:15.257 --> 00:14:23.565]  We don't claim we have all the answers, but we have a great pool of experts from, you know, staff sergeants who knew some of the people, talked to folks involved in the unit.
[00:14:24.245 --> 00:14:27.650]  He said that to me Saturday, and I said, well, I haven't seen that yet.
[00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:36.722]  Then Sunday, it was in CNN, and we'll put that article on screen, that people in his unit are saying something was weird, looked, staged us, walked off into the desert.
[00:14:37.724 --> 00:14:38.905]  This is pretty crazy.
[00:14:39.766 --> 00:14:46.012]  And again, that would be the cover for him actually defecting or going AWOL and then getting captured.
[00:14:46.813 --> 00:14:48.595]  So we'll get Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs on this.
[00:14:48.995 --> 00:14:57.003]  Leanne McAdoo has been following this since she was following the CIA asset section leader in that area, having this cover blown.
[00:14:57.443 --> 00:15:00.086]  And again, when they claim this is done by accident, give me a break.
[00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:02.770]  When Bush did this, it was a huge deal and should be.
[00:15:03.211 --> 00:15:04.473]  Why is it now happening?
[00:15:04.734 --> 00:15:07.459]  Because there's inter-agency fighting going on, bare minimum.
[00:15:07.879 --> 00:15:09.282]  And it's not a good trade either.
[00:15:10.168 --> 00:15:15.709]  Four Taliban commanders, or is it five, for some army soldier.
[00:15:16.129 --> 00:15:17.269]  They wouldn't normally do this.
[00:15:17.409 --> 00:15:18.610]  Why are they doing it now?
[00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.010]  This will encourage the grabbing of more soldiers.
[00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:25.551]  And again, this may not be clandestine, may be a great guy.
[00:15:25.891 --> 00:15:28.632]  I'm not even saying that I believe that's happening.
[00:15:28.652 --> 00:15:30.232]  I'm saying things point towards that.
[00:15:30.532 --> 00:15:31.912]  We'd be crazy if we didn't bring it up.
[00:15:32.212 --> 00:15:34.233]  Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, what's your take on this?
[00:15:34.793 --> 00:15:40.195]  Well, Saturday, just like a lot of people, I woke up to the news that Bo Bergdahl was finally coming home.
[00:15:40.995 --> 00:15:44.316]  And I was sitting there thinking, just like most people, that gut reaction, wow, this is great.
[00:15:44.696 --> 00:15:51.178]  But as I started really going back and looking at a lot of the stuff that was going on, I saw my buddy Jason Leopold out of L.A.
[00:15:51.759 --> 00:15:56.760]  He said that he's known about Bergdahl coming back since last Saturday.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.621]  He is on the White House email list.
[00:15:59.639 --> 00:16:03.042]  And the first email came out saying, Bo Bergdahl's coming back.
[00:16:03.082 --> 00:16:08.946]  And then he said he got another email that, you know, a person, you know, unknown was coming back.
[00:16:09.006 --> 00:16:14.070]  So for some reason, the White House went from saying him to then not saying his name again.
[00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:15.752]  So I found that interesting.
[00:16:16.032 --> 00:16:21.736]  But if you want, pull up that video of Bo's father talking to the president Saturday morning.
[00:16:21.756 --> 00:16:28.802]  I missed you in all the aspects of your recovery to full health.
[00:16:30.771 --> 00:16:44.764]  But most of all, I'm proud of how much you wanted to help the Afghan people and what you were willing to do to go to that length.
[00:16:47.126 --> 00:16:55.673]  My father did an interview yesterday on CNN and what he was talking about, and I just found it chilling.
[00:16:56.636 --> 00:17:12.264]  He, the whole interview, he's very calm and collective, but as soon as he talks about what his son's doing for Afghanistan, you see that vein pop up out of his head, and you see him get real teary-eyed and choked up, and I found that to be just very, you know, unusual.
[00:17:12.284 --> 00:17:25.391]  You know, a lot of the people were saying that his son, even before deployment, talked about, he said, hey, if this deployment is bogus, I will walk off the base and into the mountains of Pakistan.
[00:17:26.872 --> 00:17:27.593]  You told me that, sir.
[00:17:27.613 --> 00:17:32.321]  You have that article up on InfoWars.com.
[00:17:34.605 --> 00:17:39.927]  Well, when I got to Bob Bergdahl's account, the Twitter account, I saw that tweet.
[00:17:40.448 --> 00:17:42.108]  And I saw it right before it got deleted.
[00:17:42.428 --> 00:17:45.350]  He says, I'm still working to free all Guantanamo prisoners.
[00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:48.571]  God will repay for the death of every Afghan child.
[00:17:49.051 --> 00:17:49.391]  Amen.
[00:17:49.932 --> 00:17:57.035]  Well, Beau's father is supposed to be a devout Christian, so the fact that he misspells Amen, I found that to be a little weird too as well.
[00:18:00.006 --> 00:18:06.796]  Immediately they took that tweet down and I find that, you know, that in itself right there is a little shady too.
[00:18:07.497 --> 00:18:11.543]  You know, yesterday with that press release from his father when he goes and talks about that.
[00:18:13.826 --> 00:18:15.467]  It just sent chills down my back.
[00:18:15.887 --> 00:18:20.790]  You know, now we know Obama released five Gitmo detainees for Bo's release.
[00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:22.171]  You know, what does that mean?
[00:18:22.511 --> 00:18:29.555]  Well, the President's message to the Taliban and other enemies out there is America will pay any price to get someone out.
[00:18:29.575 --> 00:18:37.260]  I mean, these are bad things for our enemies to know that five Gitmo detainees are equivalent to one American.
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:41.042]  Now what if a Taliban kidnaps someone tomorrow?
[00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:45.971]  You know, if that's a civilian, are we going to just forget about them because they're military?
[00:18:46.471 --> 00:18:46.691]  No!
[00:18:47.632 --> 00:18:49.192]  You know, we're going to go after them.
[00:18:49.492 --> 00:18:57.094]  And when you put the price of an American, you know, put the price on an American head like Sergeant Bo Bergdahl, you put prices on everyone's head.
[00:18:57.455 --> 00:19:01.716]  Now it's unsafe for all Americans all over the world now to be out.
[00:19:01.996 --> 00:19:02.596]  Sure, sure.
[00:19:02.736 --> 00:19:04.517]  Let me ask you this question though, separately.
[00:19:05.157 --> 00:19:08.418]  On the heels of the CIA assets cover being blown,
[00:19:09.378 --> 00:19:10.639]  We now learn weeks before.
[00:19:10.659 --> 00:19:16.543]  I mean, that to me is a big connection to suddenly this guy's being sent back.
[00:19:17.704 --> 00:19:19.004]  What does this sound like to you?
[00:19:19.024 --> 00:19:20.746]  I mean, what's your gut tell you is going on there?
[00:19:21.046 --> 00:19:29.992]  Yeah, I mean, when I had time to sit down and think about this, you know, they're talking about how they blew a CIA operatives cover and all of a sudden Bo Bergdahl needed to be pulled out.
[00:19:30.632 --> 00:19:32.594]  You know, of being captive because he was in danger.
[00:19:32.894 --> 00:19:36.817]  But he wasn't in danger for the entire five years he was held captive?
[00:19:36.837 --> 00:19:38.118]  I mean, that doesn't make sense.
[00:19:38.158 --> 00:19:43.042]  The Haqqani Network is one of the most vile, evil terrorist networks out there.
[00:19:43.062 --> 00:19:45.484]  They're called the Sopranos of Afghanistan.
[00:19:45.964 --> 00:19:51.128]  You know, these guys chop people's heads off, and he was fine for those five years, but now he's in danger?
[00:19:51.148 --> 00:19:52.109]  I don't get that.
[00:19:53.971 --> 00:20:00.414]  Well, let's come back and continue to break this down and what this means for Obama with all the different resignations in his administration and the rest of it.
[00:20:00.434 --> 00:20:01.754]  Straight ahead with Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs.
[00:20:02.095 --> 00:20:02.815]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:20:02.875 --> 00:20:05.096]  It's June 2nd on this Monday edition.
[00:20:05.136 --> 00:20:05.476]  Stay with us.
[00:20:10.078 --> 00:20:13.920]  How long would you last if all grocery stores ceased to exist?
[00:20:15.001 --> 00:20:15.861]  Not in America.
[00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:17.341]  This can't happen in America.
[00:20:17.701 --> 00:20:19.402]  Because I'm not concerned about our government.
[00:20:19.942 --> 00:20:21.422]  I'm looking at survival stuff.
[00:20:21.762 --> 00:20:24.843]  I was raised as a Girl Scout and their motto was to be prepared.
[00:20:25.223 --> 00:20:30.484]  Food for Patriots was an opportunity for me to be able to put some things aside.
[00:20:30.504 --> 00:20:34.404]  I said, well, this is a product worth having, because it's so good.
[00:20:34.424 --> 00:20:36.865]  I like the pricing for what I got.
[00:20:37.385 --> 00:20:39.525]  I like the containers they were shipped in.
[00:20:39.545 --> 00:20:41.026]  They keep in touch with you.
[00:20:41.046 --> 00:20:41.926]  You get your emails.
[00:20:41.966 --> 00:20:43.326]  You get your confirmations.
[00:20:43.766 --> 00:20:47.149]  Customer service is just absolutely fantastic.
[00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:51.394]  Plan on buying probably about four more of these minimum.
[00:20:51.474 --> 00:20:52.615]  And this just came so quick.
[00:20:52.695 --> 00:20:54.216]  It came right when they said it would come.
[00:20:54.296 --> 00:20:59.842]  Thanks for supplying all this stuff for us, because I think we're all going to be needing it in a very short time.
[00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:03.812]  Join over 50,000 Americans who have trusted Food for Patriots.

[00:22:09.502 --> 00:22:15.610]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential foreclosure situation?
[00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:18.954]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:22:19.055 --> 00:22:20.637]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:22:20.697 --> 00:22:26.865]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:22:27.005 --> 00:22:32.949]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:22:33.049 --> 00:22:36.791]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:22:36.991 --> 00:22:39.913]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:22:39.933 --> 00:22:48.079]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:22:48.319 --> 00:22:50.360]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:51.461]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:22:51.821 --> 00:23:00.529]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[00:23:10.055 --> 00:23:14.397]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:23:14.557 --> 00:23:20.179]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:23:20.259 --> 00:23:23.621]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:24:32.101 --> 00:24:38.406]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us with this Monday, Worldwide, June 2nd, 2014 Global Transmission.
[00:24:38.867 --> 00:24:58.121]  I am Alex Jones, reporting from on the road, and I will be reporting for the next few days from the road, but the great part about the InfoWars operation is we have the amazing team of the writers, the researchers, the investigative journalists, the reporters, everyone working together with that great team behind the scenes, technically as well.
[00:25:03.288 --> 00:25:06.652]  Chris Jordan, John Bowne, Nico, everyone.
[00:25:06.692 --> 00:25:07.412]  I mean, there's a lot of folks.
[00:25:07.472 --> 00:25:13.398]  I just don't have time to think, but they are certainly all amazing in there doing a super job.
[00:25:13.919 --> 00:25:22.388]  Now, going back to Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, who has friends from the Army who knew this guy, and they've turned him into this cause celeb.
[00:25:22.428 --> 00:25:22.788]  And you know what?
[00:25:22.808 --> 00:25:23.249]  He might have
[00:25:24.335 --> 00:25:26.416]  You know, gone off in the desert and got grabbed by these guys.
[00:25:26.737 --> 00:25:30.639]  We need to go back to the original story of Bo Bergdahl.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.420]  What do we know about that?
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.703]  I mean, how did he get supposedly captured by the Taliban?
[00:25:36.123 --> 00:25:46.009]  And why are his comrades saying that he was more of a deserter, that's the headline in CNN, than this Taliban victim?
[00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:47.070]  What's really going on here?
[00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:52.034]  And why does his dad get all choked up when he talks about the Afghan people?
[00:25:52.114 --> 00:25:53.755]  I mean, that just sounds like a psy-op to me.
[00:25:54.475 --> 00:25:59.397]  Well, he was in a infantry unit out of Alaska.
[00:26:00.177 --> 00:26:06.380]  And when he joined the army, a lot of the guys didn't like him because they said he didn't interact with people.
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:11.181]  He read books all the time, stayed to himself, practiced meditation.
[00:26:11.201 --> 00:26:13.762]  He would do curls with his saw.
[00:26:14.183 --> 00:26:17.644]  You know, he was just very dedicated to his cause at the time.
[00:26:19.198 --> 00:26:27.043]  And now, we have two stories, and the first story is, is, you know, he had walked off the base and was then AWOL.
[00:26:27.543 --> 00:26:34.648]  Another story is, is that he was on a foot patrol and fell behind, and he actually fell behind to use the bathroom.
[00:26:34.688 --> 00:26:41.332]  He had, you know, sat down to use the bathroom, and a Taliban guy grabbed him and, you know, took him.
[00:26:42.012 --> 00:26:47.737]  And you can, if you read the Hastings article, it talks about he's got some of the chatter in there on the Taliban.
[00:26:47.877 --> 00:26:50.280]  They're laughing, saying, oh, we've got an American.
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:51.381]  Let's make a video.
[00:26:51.421 --> 00:26:54.303]  Let's get it out to everyone and let them know that we have somebody.
[00:26:55.324 --> 00:27:02.330]  So there's two different stories, but I find it believable that he did walk off the base and desert.
[00:27:04.232 --> 00:27:05.073]  What do you think about that?
[00:27:06.368 --> 00:27:09.813]  Well, I mean, that's what his buddies are saying, and they could be wrong.
[00:27:10.253 --> 00:27:13.237]  It's just that, again, he didn't fit in with everybody.
[00:27:13.818 --> 00:27:19.245]  And just what you described there, it sounds more like an intelligence agency operative's M.O.
[00:27:19.285 --> 00:27:20.227]  than a soldier's M.O.
[00:27:20.267 --> 00:27:20.747]  What do you think?
[00:27:21.328 --> 00:27:23.489]  Well, the funny thing of those is about his father.
[00:27:23.709 --> 00:27:24.749]  He is a U.S.
[00:27:25.049 --> 00:27:28.190]  Postal Service worker and had been for 20-something years.
[00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:45.816]  The fact that he speaks Pashtun in a very perfect dialect, I don't know many people in Idaho who probably speak Pashtun, but I think it's kind of odd that this man speaks it to the T. I mean, just his, the way he sounded, the way he said everything was spot on from what I heard when I was in Afghanistan.
[00:27:46.176 --> 00:27:47.777]  So I think there's a little something behind him.
[00:27:49.033 --> 00:27:51.954]  What was Bergdahl's special mission to help the Afghan people?
[00:27:52.114 --> 00:27:52.954]  I mean, what does that mean?
[00:27:53.794 --> 00:28:07.238]  Well, from a lot of the emails that he was sending home, he said that, you know, he was ashamed to be an American because of what he saw going on over there, and that he felt like he needed to help the Afghan people and get out there.
[00:28:07.298 --> 00:28:10.479]  So, I'm thinking he... And then he's the one that gets captured.
[00:28:10.559 --> 00:28:11.799]  He's the one that gets captured.
[00:28:12.019 --> 00:28:14.700]  Sounds like a perfect person to infiltrate their network.
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.162]  I mean, maybe he is a hero, like his dad says.
[00:28:17.402 --> 00:28:22.926]  If he had the courage to get picked up on purpose to go into captivity, maybe the guy is a hero.
[00:28:23.186 --> 00:28:24.167]  We're just not getting it.
[00:28:24.647 --> 00:28:27.049]  Then the question is, why is Obama now revealing it?
[00:28:27.069 --> 00:28:30.612]  It's because his cover got blown by this section chief.
[00:28:31.353 --> 00:28:41.320]  What's weird is, when his dad talks, Jesse goes, I'm proud of how much you wanted to help Afghan people, that you were willing to go to the length that you did to help them out.
[00:28:43.772 --> 00:28:47.473]  Confirming that his son did, in fact, walk off the base and go AWOL?
[00:28:48.773 --> 00:28:54.775]  That's what I find to be just a little... Everyone's stories right now, when you start putting all these pieces together, you know, look at him right now.
[00:28:54.835 --> 00:28:56.376]  He's smiling, looking at the President.
[00:28:56.976 --> 00:29:01.437]  I just think there's something other than this whole happy, welcoming home story going on.
[00:29:01.457 --> 00:29:05.098]  I was about to say, most families, they're not going to get him anywhere near Obama.
[00:29:05.638 --> 00:29:07.220]  The Navy SEAL families, you name it.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.642]  I mean, they act like they know each other.
[00:29:09.702 --> 00:29:11.664]  I mean, this, this, this, this whole thing.
[00:29:12.044 --> 00:29:15.868]  The father needs to answer these questions because he's done some stuff that's unusual.
[00:29:16.188 --> 00:29:22.134]  You do unusual stuff under stress, but I mean, you know, I thought he was like a hillbilly with the beard and all that until he started speaking Pashtun.
[00:29:22.995 --> 00:29:27.820]  I tell you, Biggs, I want to find out from your other Army buddies what they think about this.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.182]  I know you've already been talking to some of them.
[00:29:29.542 --> 00:29:31.785]  When we come back, let's talk about that with Leanne McAdoo.
[00:29:32.165 --> 00:29:37.632]  And let's also open the phones up for active duty or former Army that know anything, specifically 800-259-9231.
[00:29:37.712 --> 00:29:39.594]  Do you know anything or what's your gut tell you?
[00:29:43.678 --> 00:29:43.778]  800-259-9231.
[00:29:44.599 --> 00:29:46.299]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:29:46.379 --> 00:29:49.441]  This is real talk radio.
[00:29:49.561 --> 00:29:50.181]  Real issues.
[00:29:50.481 --> 00:29:51.461]  Not mindless fluff.
[00:29:51.681 --> 00:29:53.382]  This is the thinking person's radio.
[00:29:53.662 --> 00:29:54.422]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:29:54.723 --> 00:29:58.564]  Infowars.com.
[00:29:59.104 --> 00:30:00.025]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.505 --> 00:30:02.105]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.046 --> 00:30:05.707]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:11.039 --> 00:30:12.100]  In the near future.
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:16.023]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[00:30:16.043 --> 00:30:16.543]  Security alert.
[00:30:16.884 --> 00:30:17.884]  Security alert.
[00:30:18.105 --> 00:30:19.846]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:30:20.106 --> 00:30:20.727]  Analysis.
[00:30:21.007 --> 00:30:21.647]  InfoWars.
[00:30:21.707 --> 00:30:23.649]  Building independent media operations.
[00:30:23.669 --> 00:30:28.653]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:30:28.693 --> 00:30:29.633]  Crime Directive.
[00:30:29.733 --> 00:30:31.134]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:30:31.275 --> 00:30:34.057]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:30:34.117 --> 00:30:37.199]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:30:37.379 --> 00:30:39.541]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:30:39.701 --> 00:30:41.142]  These people are assaulting us!
[00:30:41.182 --> 00:30:43.523]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:30:44.003 --> 00:30:45.684]  They are never going to stop.
[00:30:45.964 --> 00:30:49.866]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[00:30:50.007 --> 00:30:53.208]  Block free iPhone ads at Infowars.com.
[00:30:53.608 --> 00:30:56.250]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:57.711]  Imperative.
[00:30:57.951 --> 00:30:59.952]  Destroy Prison Planet TV.
[00:30:59.972 --> 00:31:04.374]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:31:04.514 --> 00:31:06.916]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it!
[00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:12.573]  This is Leanne McAdoo for InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:31:12.854 --> 00:31:18.760]  I'm here with Dr. Edward Group, Master Herbologist and Chief Formulator behind the InfoWarsLife products.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:23.385]  Dr. Group, what have you been hearing from women who've started taking Super Female Vitality?
[00:31:23.485 --> 00:31:30.053]  You know, we've heard the reviews and feedback from Super Male Vitality from emails to even excited callers on the radio.
[00:31:30.333 --> 00:31:32.215]  Now, the answer for women is here.
[00:31:32.375 --> 00:31:43.904]  A new formulation specifically designed for the female body, Super Female Vitality, delivers 10 key herbs that work synergistically to revitalize the unique biology of women.
[00:31:44.024 --> 00:31:46.026]  I'm so glad that you guys made this for women.
[00:31:46.046 --> 00:31:51.590]  When he brought me home the bottle of Super Female, I had tons of energy, tons of motivation, a lot of drive.
[00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:52.851]  My husband thinks I've been in a better mood.
[00:31:52.891 --> 00:31:55.253]  Our relationship, all I can say is this is a lot better.
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:59.902]  I've just started taking Super Female Vitality from InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:32:00.082 --> 00:32:08.224]  Supplies are limited, so secure yours today at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or dial 1-888-253-3139.
[00:32:08.765 --> 00:32:13.886]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:32:13.926 --> 00:32:17.988]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:32:18.268 --> 00:32:21.690]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:24.812]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:32:24.973 --> 00:32:32.317]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins of heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:32:32.558 --> 00:32:36.180]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:40.701]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:32:40.881 --> 00:32:46.802]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:32:46.842 --> 00:32:50.863]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:32:50.903 --> 00:32:53.323]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:32:53.524 --> 00:32:54.864]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:32:55.024 --> 00:32:56.244]  It's time to take action.
[00:32:56.384 --> 00:32:58.084]  It's time to filter our water.
[00:32:58.205 --> 00:33:05.346]  Visit InfoWarsThor.com and use promo code WATER to get 10% off their entire family of incredible products.
[00:33:05.566 --> 00:33:06.907]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[00:33:06.927 --> 00:33:08.888]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:33:08.908 --> 00:33:17.673]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:35.602 --> 00:33:41.844]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, everybody knows I don't like the military-industrial complex.
[00:33:42.464 --> 00:33:46.625]  I don't like what the CIA did in 1947, taking over our government, making it secret.
[00:33:47.565 --> 00:33:53.727]  But at the same time, there are people like Tosh Plumley, famous CIA contractor who's a patriot and continues to expose bad stuff.
[00:33:54.647 --> 00:33:59.708]  I've had family that worked in the Army and CIA and places who were great patriots and who loved liberty.
[00:34:01.098 --> 00:34:07.020]  But it's the top-down system that is so incredibly corrupt.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:13.262]  And when you've studied this for 20 years like I have or longer, you learn to recognize when a story doesn't wash.
[00:34:13.362 --> 00:34:15.022]  And by the way, I'm not the only one.
[00:34:15.542 --> 00:34:29.607]  Our listeners, Saturday and Sunday, when we had just little articles posted on Infowars.com with the mainstream story, and just little blurbs from AP and CNN and places, people are like, how dare you post this saying this is real, this is pure bull.
[00:34:30.327 --> 00:34:33.229]  You know, Jones, I'm getting sick of you towing the establishment line.
[00:34:33.269 --> 00:34:36.752]  And by the way, that shooting two weeks ago in California was fake.
[00:34:37.532 --> 00:34:39.954]  Listen, I know they stage stuff.
[00:34:40.715 --> 00:34:41.775]  I know a lot of stuff's fake.
[00:34:42.496 --> 00:34:43.677]  Sometimes things aren't fake.
[00:34:44.377 --> 00:34:47.059]  And I just don't say something's fake out of the gates.
[00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:49.421]  The Bin Laden thing takes two hours to cover.
[00:34:49.541 --> 00:34:49.981]  We've done it.
[00:34:50.302 --> 00:34:57.407]  The videos have, you know, three, four million views apiece on YouTube alone of my radio show and TV show breaking down why the Bin Laden thing was fake.
[00:34:58.769 --> 00:35:03.817]  This looks like it's fake, but we don't know how it's fake, is my view.
[00:35:05.199 --> 00:35:06.701]  We're not getting one-tenth the story.
[00:35:07.162 --> 00:35:08.785]  This is propaganda for Obama.
[00:35:08.845 --> 00:35:13.292]  It's blowing up in his face, showing that they tried to spin something that was already bad.
[00:35:14.884 --> 00:35:16.825]  You can tell when they really stage something.
[00:35:16.865 --> 00:35:17.686]  They're all lined up.
[00:35:17.706 --> 00:35:18.366]  They're all ready.
[00:35:18.667 --> 00:35:19.767]  It's a unified message.
[00:35:20.728 --> 00:35:21.528]  Like Sandy Hook.
[00:35:22.049 --> 00:35:24.951]  Or the Bin Laden supposed raid, killing.
[00:35:25.831 --> 00:35:37.279]  But in the case of other events, when it's all over the map and a train wreck, it's them trying to use a crisis and not let it go to waste, as the White House Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, now Chicago Mob Boss, said.
[00:35:38.496 --> 00:35:44.698]  Now before I go any further, we're going to go back to Biggs, play some White House clips, get Leon McAdoo's take on this, and take your calls.
[00:35:44.978 --> 00:35:53.120]  And I'll let Biggs go off the screen and announce who those callers are once we're ready to go to those calls at about 45 after or so.
[00:35:53.461 --> 00:35:57.102]  Because again, he's in the main chair running the show in the first hour.
[00:35:57.162 --> 00:35:58.142]  We have another guest coming up.
[00:35:58.822 --> 00:36:04.427]  In the second and third hour, John Rapoport, who I like to have on routinely, he was on for 15 minutes with us Sunday.
[00:36:04.447 --> 00:36:07.689]  He'll be riding shotgun with us covering a host of news as well today.
[00:36:07.709 --> 00:36:12.593]  We'll probably rope in some of the other reporters today and play some of their special reports as well.
[00:36:13.573 --> 00:36:20.419]  But please don't forget this entire media operation is truly organic, truly liberty-based, truth-based.
[00:36:20.999 --> 00:36:22.222]  Our bias is telling the truth.
[00:36:22.543 --> 00:36:23.766]  Our bias is being honorable.
[00:36:24.187 --> 00:36:25.429]  Our bias is chivalry.
[00:36:26.011 --> 00:36:29.459]  Our bias is trying to bring back freedom and what made America great.
[00:36:30.367 --> 00:36:32.088]  Our bias is being good guys.
[00:36:32.468 --> 00:36:33.829]  Our bias is not being cowards.
[00:36:34.389 --> 00:36:37.251]  And we fund this operation bringing you the very best products out there.
[00:36:37.551 --> 00:36:42.754]  The Pro-Pure G2, filters that cut out all the glyphosate, the hydrofluorosilicic acid, all of it.
[00:36:43.374 --> 00:36:45.235]  Annihilates the competition side by side.
[00:36:45.495 --> 00:36:46.916]  Or I'd be selling the competition.
[00:36:47.296 --> 00:36:54.060]  We sell more than 12 different companies, non-GMO, heirloom, super high quality seeds at the lowest price available anywhere.
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:55.941]  At the InfoWare Store Seed Center.
[00:36:56.341 --> 00:36:57.242]  InfoWareStore.com.
[00:36:58.042 --> 00:37:08.089]  If there were five great gravity-fed filter companies out there that we hadn't tried to work with over the years and had issues with, in customer service, you name it, we would be selling it all.
[00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:13.433]  So, it's not some differentiation of, my filter outsells the best.
[00:37:14.093 --> 00:37:15.554]  And everybody else is terrible.
[00:37:16.014 --> 00:37:17.375]  I would be selling all of them.
[00:37:17.475 --> 00:37:19.116]  That's how I do things, okay?
[00:37:19.416 --> 00:37:21.357]  I would sell everything good I could get my hands on.
[00:37:21.897 --> 00:37:28.181]  We sell, like, four different companies of shortwave radios, from super expensive, down to very inexpensive, but not, you know, not junky.
[00:37:29.842 --> 00:37:31.543]  That's all available at infowarrestore.com.
[00:37:32.717 --> 00:37:39.141]  When it comes to supplements, we've got the great longevity supplements at InfoWarsHealth.com, the Beyond Tangy Tangerine, you name it.
[00:37:39.862 --> 00:37:49.408]  But we want to develop truly original things like the proprietary nascent iodine that we quietly believe probably is the only real nascent iodine out there, truly.
[00:37:49.448 --> 00:37:52.990]  We've got tests that we're going to be showing people, both lay tests and scientific very soon.
[00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:58.873]  Also, expanding on that, we have the super male vitality that's so popular.
[00:37:58.893 --> 00:37:59.794]  You've heard the rave reviews.
[00:38:00.154 --> 00:38:02.235]  The super feminine vitality just came out.
[00:38:02.575 --> 00:38:04.316]  We got a limited couple thousand bottles.
[00:38:05.057 --> 00:38:12.741]  They have effectively sold out as of today, but the laboratory knew we would want more without us asking and ran about a thousand more.
[00:38:13.161 --> 00:38:19.705]  Those are being labeled now, so we're not going to take it down and say back order right now, where you can't even get it.
[00:38:20.603 --> 00:38:24.646]  We are saying you better get the Super Feminine Vitality right now if you want it.
[00:38:25.227 --> 00:38:26.047]  It's that popular.
[00:38:26.848 --> 00:38:29.350]  So when that thousand's gone, it'll take a few weeks to get more.
[00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:33.113]  The X2, we had a lot of it made.
[00:38:34.053 --> 00:38:38.056]  Multi-years in the development and testing that Dr. Group was putting together.
[00:38:38.157 --> 00:38:42.620]  And we have the regular Super Nation Iodine Survival Shield as proprietary.
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:43.200]  That's excellent.
[00:38:43.581 --> 00:38:44.581]  I believe it's great for kids.
[00:38:44.622 --> 00:38:45.342]  Check with your physician.
[00:38:45.382 --> 00:38:46.063]  It's not as strong.
[00:38:46.123 --> 00:38:46.623]  It's excellent.
[00:38:47.584 --> 00:38:49.785]  I had to build up, even with it, I had a toxic
[00:38:50.706 --> 00:38:53.148]  Detox response that group predicted two weeks.
[00:38:53.189 --> 00:38:59.134]  He said two weeks to a month in and then it was amazing after my skin cleared up Just I never really had bad skin, but all the stuff came out.
[00:38:59.374 --> 00:39:02.858]  I lost a bunch of weight more energy It came at a perfect time in my life.
[00:39:02.898 --> 00:39:06.661]  Well, he said look he told me a year ago He goes don't come out with this and make something even better.
[00:39:06.681 --> 00:39:07.902]  I don't know you take forever.
[00:39:07.922 --> 00:39:09.384]  I want to put this out It's great.
[00:39:09.624 --> 00:39:09.844]  He goes.
[00:39:09.904 --> 00:39:14.809]  Okay, then he came out with the new x2 for us proprietary with us and
[00:39:16.395 --> 00:39:18.357]  And it's bright red.
[00:39:18.537 --> 00:39:25.302]  It's not black or dark brown like the other iodines that you still need, obviously, but aren't as good from our research.
[00:39:26.122 --> 00:39:28.744]  And then you have the other more palatable but weaker
[00:39:29.833 --> 00:39:34.396]  It was stronger than other iodines of the similar type, but weaker compared to some of the, you know, Lugol's type stuff.
[00:39:35.137 --> 00:39:41.802]  This new X2 is bright red, and then it turns bright blue-purple on paper, like five times darker than our other survival shield.
[00:39:42.062 --> 00:39:42.982]  And we're still selling both.
[00:39:43.002 --> 00:39:48.727]  We've discounted the original survival shield an additional $5, and the new survival shield's the same price as the old survival shield.
[00:39:48.747 --> 00:39:51.969]  So, X2, and then of course we have the original X1.
[00:39:52.409 --> 00:39:54.751]  And I don't really see us coming out with any other X's after this.
[00:39:55.491 --> 00:39:57.033]  It's just that it's funding the operation.
[00:39:57.473 --> 00:40:04.180]  At current sales rates, it'll be sold out by the end of the week, and that it may be as much as two months until we get more of it.
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:11.768]  We believe it'll be sooner, but again, these purple crystals that nobody else has, the other stuff's out of seaweed, I'm not knocking that.
[00:40:12.108 --> 00:40:16.873]  This is from a mine, purple crystals that eat through the floor like in the movie Alien.
[00:40:17.413 --> 00:40:21.396]  When they're not in this gas form put into the tincture.
[00:40:22.057 --> 00:40:23.337]  That's why it goes right to the blood.
[00:40:23.377 --> 00:40:24.458]  That's why it's so different.
[00:40:25.079 --> 00:40:27.641]  I mean, literally, real iodine is amazing.
[00:40:27.881 --> 00:40:28.921]  That's why it detoxes.
[00:40:28.941 --> 00:40:30.242]  That's why it goes through the body.
[00:40:31.103 --> 00:40:33.125]  It's why they put stuff that blocks it in the water.
[00:40:33.425 --> 00:40:34.405]  Because it's incredible.
[00:40:34.465 --> 00:40:35.927]  I mean, just try it for yourself.
[00:40:36.207 --> 00:40:37.328]  It's fun in the operation.
[00:40:37.568 --> 00:40:38.809]  We appreciate all your support.
[00:40:39.029 --> 00:40:46.094]  But that's how we're able to bring you this information is with revolutionary products like X2 and Super Feminine Vitality and Super Male Vitality.
[00:40:46.374 --> 00:40:46.474]  Yes.
[00:41:01.291 --> 00:41:07.633]  We're just trying to find out exactly what's going on here, but the story doesn't add up and his own members of his unit are saying that.
[00:41:07.653 --> 00:41:09.234]  Staff Sergeant Biggs, you've got a clip you want to play.
[00:41:27.361 --> 00:41:34.045]  Yeah, I wanted everyone to see that clip from his parents talking to the President of the White House on Saturday.
[00:41:34.786 --> 00:41:45.353]  I just want to see what everyone thinks about how he reacts and how he's talking to the President, and listen to his dialect, how he's speaking Pashtun, and how it's so, you know, perfect and just on point.
[00:41:48.274 --> 00:41:54.839]  I'd like to say to Beau right now, who's having trouble speaking English, I'm your father, Beau.
[00:41:58.115 --> 00:42:01.738]  Um, the people of Afghanistan, the same.
[00:42:02.639 --> 00:42:05.301]  Um, Khalifa Al Thani.
[00:42:08.043 --> 00:42:11.866]  I mean, what is, what is he, he's bringing up that Afghanistan again.
[00:42:11.886 --> 00:42:18.031]  I mean, he is, it sounds like his son's been trained to super deep cover for this mission all along to penetrate their network.
[00:42:18.922 --> 00:42:19.642]  Yeah, definitely.
[00:42:19.663 --> 00:42:28.488]  I mean, I think he was in, he had to have been in contact with the Haqqani Network as well to keep up his dialect and to be able to keep speaking that way.
[00:42:28.528 --> 00:42:31.991]  I mean, he had to be doing some negotiations for a long time himself.
[00:42:32.031 --> 00:42:33.151]  I don't know what you know.
[00:42:34.092 --> 00:42:36.734]  And of course, five years your son gone, you would learn how to do this stuff.
[00:42:37.274 --> 00:42:41.697]  But, but I mean, you told me that's one of the hardest languages to understand or speak correctly.
[00:42:41.837 --> 00:42:45.000]  Yeah, I mean, when I was over there, I had to use Rosetta Stone.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.922]  And when you're in the Army, they give you a free copy of that.
[00:42:47.942 --> 00:42:50.965]  You're able to go on and learn languages like that.
[00:42:51.005 --> 00:42:55.989]  So when I was over there, I was able to pick it up for a little bit of time, you know, learn how to write a little bit as well.
[00:42:56.229 --> 00:42:59.912]  But once you get back and you don't have anybody to talk to, that goes away really fast.
[00:42:59.972 --> 00:43:06.978]  I mean, I don't know who he's talking to in Idaho to be able to keep that up at all.
[00:43:08.104 --> 00:43:08.584]  Absolutely.
[00:43:08.604 --> 00:43:13.928]  I mean to copy a Texas accent properly, you need to live here years and years and years.
[00:43:14.308 --> 00:43:15.009]  It's the same deal.
[00:43:15.029 --> 00:43:20.593]  I mean, how does he in Idaho speak with a, you're saying that Pashtun accent sounds dead on or close?
[00:43:20.853 --> 00:43:21.814]  It's very close.
[00:43:21.894 --> 00:43:23.215]  I mean, it's not easy.
[00:43:23.255 --> 00:43:33.322]  I mean, I've heard a lot of Americans who are interpreters who learn the language and they don't come off as comfortable and as well versed as he does in that, you know, in that interview with the president.
[00:43:33.542 --> 00:43:35.844]  And he's doing it with the President on national television.
[00:43:35.884 --> 00:43:38.867]  Yeah, smiling, patting each other on the back, you know, having a good old time.
[00:43:40.528 --> 00:43:42.570]  Do we have any callers yet on the board there, Staff Sergeant?
[00:43:43.351 --> 00:43:48.475]  Um, yes, I see... Okay, well, just be ready to go to those after we get Leanne's take on this.
[00:43:48.835 --> 00:43:50.877]  Leanne McAdoo, what is your take on this?
[00:43:50.937 --> 00:43:56.122]  I know you've been researching this the last few days and you have your perspective on it.
[00:43:57.045 --> 00:43:58.987]  Well, it's all kind of throwing me off.
[00:43:59.107 --> 00:44:06.396]  I was celebrating my little brother's graduation when they announced this on Saturday, so I really didn't know who they were even speaking about.
[00:44:06.416 --> 00:44:15.767]  I just saw, you know, the line there, POW had been released, and so I was just kind of watching it, you know, watching Obama, you know, and his
[00:44:16.972 --> 00:44:17.372]  Demeanor.
[00:44:32.879 --> 00:44:46.206]  And then he gets up and he, you can really see in his demeanor, just the way that he was even interacting with Obama, and Obama says, I want the father to speak, and then if the mother has anything to add, you know, we'll let that happen.
[00:44:46.346 --> 00:44:53.910]  And they didn't even listen to him, they did, she spoke, and then he went up and speak, and you could see Obama's face, the way that he reacts to
[00:44:55.231 --> 00:44:55.411]  I think?
[00:45:19.645 --> 00:45:22.087]  Become a sympathizer with him as well?
[00:45:22.227 --> 00:45:25.390]  Or, I mean, clearly, like, he's got the beard and... Well, that is Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:34.977]  I mean, this could just be Stockholm Syndrome, that more and more people, and Americans are primed for this now, that when they're under an oppressor, they tend to start worshipping the oppressor.
[00:45:35.358 --> 00:45:38.260]  That explains the worship of our big, fat, out-of-control, evil government.
[00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:39.541]  That could be it, too.
[00:45:40.141 --> 00:45:42.223]  It could be he's deep-covered to infiltrate the group.
[00:45:42.623 --> 00:45:43.804]  Well, that was my first instinct.
[00:45:43.824 --> 00:45:45.526]  That was my very first instinct.
[00:45:45.566 --> 00:45:46.787]  That's what you told me Saturday, yeah.
[00:45:47.307 --> 00:45:49.048]  Well, because I didn't know who they were speaking about.
[00:45:49.128 --> 00:45:54.452]  And then I just see him, the man, come out and speak Pashtun and say, you know, thank you so much for everyone that's helped.
[00:45:54.492 --> 00:45:57.033]  And then I was like, man, that guy's deep cover.
[00:45:57.154 --> 00:45:59.455]  That's deep cover right there.
[00:45:59.855 --> 00:46:06.119]  That they're getting his kid out now, who had gone to, you know, such lengths to assimilate into this network.
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:08.561]  And then his father as well.
[00:46:08.861 --> 00:46:11.583]  I mean, that's, to me, that's my first instinct.
[00:46:11.623 --> 00:46:14.085]  Well, show that Brett Bard article real quick, if you don't mind.
[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:20.088]  And it's titled, Did the Obama White House Trade Five Terrorists for Taliban Sympathizer?
[00:46:20.548 --> 00:46:23.292]  And it says, in 2010, the Taliban claimed that Sgt.
[00:46:23.332 --> 00:46:27.819]  Bo Bergdahl had converted to Islam and had taught them bomb-making techniques.
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:30.483]  Bergdahl had also changed his name to Abdullah.
[00:46:31.024 --> 00:46:36.208]  You know, this is very comparable to the tell of Sergeant Brody and the Homeland Show on Showtime.
[00:46:36.649 --> 00:46:37.990]  That's what, I'm glad you said that.
[00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:39.631]  I was thinking about that last night and forgotten.
[00:46:39.671 --> 00:46:41.392]  That's the angle we need to look at here.
[00:46:41.673 --> 00:46:47.998]  Because I'm telling you, they have this narrative on all these shows like Homeland and cartoons and everywhere that the vets are going to be the terrorists.
[00:46:48.258 --> 00:46:50.179]  That the vets have all turned to Taliban.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.621]  They've all turned to Al-Qaeda.
[00:46:51.801 --> 00:46:54.063]  They're all going to attack you, which is ridiculous.
[00:46:54.323 --> 00:47:00.488]  So they have to manufacture it then in this narrative to make the troops and the Tea Party the new Al-Qaeda.
[00:47:00.988 --> 00:47:09.150]  I've been writing articles for six years about how they were going to claim white Al Qaeda and claim this narrative because we got some of their internal documents that we published, obviously.
[00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:12.251]  And then here we are, you know, saying why we don't trust it.
[00:47:12.851 --> 00:47:18.172]  That's because our subconscious has all this data we've already covered in thousands of shows, and now it's bubbling out.
[00:47:18.532 --> 00:47:20.093]  That's the angle right there, Biggs.
[00:47:20.113 --> 00:47:20.673]  You just hit it.
[00:47:22.528 --> 00:47:23.189]  Right, exactly.
[00:47:23.209 --> 00:47:33.637]  Well, we were speaking, you know, on Saturday just watching this and Biggs is like, well, the real story is the fact that we traded these five terrorists for this one soldier that's going to set an awful precedent.
[00:47:33.678 --> 00:47:39.362]  But less than 24 hours, you know, usually the media would just say, well, Obama says this guy's a hero.
[00:47:39.542 --> 00:47:40.303]  Case closed.
[00:47:40.463 --> 00:47:40.983]  Let's move on.
[00:47:42.004 --> 00:48:04.049]  Less than 24 hours later they are already all these articles with all this backstory saying is this did we just you know rescue this guy who had defected anyway and so they were immediately going with this different story and so I was talking to Biggs like you know we've got the the photos that surfaced of the first white suicide bomber and how this was
[00:48:05.149 --> 00:48:13.033]  Foreign policy, I believe, who's saying that the big fear is that Americans teaming up with Al-Qaeda-affiliated groups will return to the U.S.
[00:48:13.073 --> 00:48:14.674]  to conduct terrorist attacks.
[00:48:15.414 --> 00:48:18.556]  And so now they're kind of pulling in this whole story.
[00:48:20.162 --> 00:48:25.926]  Well, I was talking to my buddy yesterday, Jason Leopold, and the FBI likes to call him the FOIA terrorist.
[00:48:26.007 --> 00:48:28.548]  And, you know, I wanted to throw a few of these things by him as well.
[00:48:28.969 --> 00:48:34.273]  And one of the things he had mentioned was, he's like, he's like, remember that email you got from Hastings?
[00:48:34.453 --> 00:48:37.195]  And he said that the FBI was coming after him and looking for him.
[00:48:37.656 --> 00:48:40.057]  And I go, yeah, he's like, I think this is what it was about.
[00:48:40.117 --> 00:48:41.438]  Because if you remember,
[00:48:42.239 --> 00:48:48.061]  Hastings' last article was America's Last Prisoner of War, and it was about Bo Burgle at the time.
[00:48:48.081 --> 00:48:49.822]  Wait, it's all coming together?
[00:48:50.062 --> 00:48:50.262]  Yeah.
[00:48:50.602 --> 00:48:51.763]  I'd forgotten you'd said that.
[00:48:51.803 --> 00:48:53.263]  You need to get your buddy on the show.
[00:48:53.283 --> 00:48:53.764]  Can you do that?
[00:48:54.504 --> 00:48:54.964]  Possibly.
[00:48:55.304 --> 00:48:57.305]  I'll give him a call again today and see what he can do.
[00:48:57.325 --> 00:48:58.946]  Well, let's do it tomorrow.
[00:48:59.206 --> 00:49:00.786]  Yeah.
[00:49:00.826 --> 00:49:01.767]  Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:49:01.787 --> 00:49:02.127]  I forgot.
[00:49:02.387 --> 00:49:04.008]  Hastings did an article about this.
[00:49:04.368 --> 00:49:05.408]  You were just mentioning it.
[00:49:06.048 --> 00:49:06.769]  Oh my gosh.
[00:49:06.969 --> 00:49:08.769]  So what does your buddy think?
[00:49:10.492 --> 00:49:14.794]  I mean, we all think this is connected now, you know, with the death and all that as well.
[00:49:14.894 --> 00:49:24.500]  He honestly thinks that the FBI was after him because of this, you know, and shortly after his death, he says, you know, the FBI released a statement saying we have nothing to do with this.
[00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:32.544]  But after many FOIA attempts and all that, it's come to light that the FBI was looking into him because of his interest in Bo Bergdahl.
[00:49:32.965 --> 00:49:36.887]  And they found it very disturbing, and they called that controversial journalism.
[00:49:38.356 --> 00:49:41.217]  That's right, and you talked about this months ago on the show.
[00:49:41.877 --> 00:49:47.698]  So here we are talking about Bo Bergdahl and this months ago in association with Hastings' death.
[00:49:47.738 --> 00:49:50.939]  And we know the FBI visited his house, or we know the Fed showed up.
[00:49:50.999 --> 00:49:56.561]  We know his wife, who you went to the funeral, who you knew, said that she was mad and upset.
[00:49:56.781 --> 00:50:01.542]  Then she goes on CNN with Piers Morgan and says, everything's wonderful, like a Stepford wife.
[00:50:01.622 --> 00:50:03.443]  I mean, this is really starting to smell.
[00:50:03.983 --> 00:50:04.743]  Coming full circle.
[00:50:05.163 --> 00:50:08.969]  And she was the head assistant to the National Security Council.
[00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:11.873]  I mean, that's the top of the pyramid.
[00:50:11.933 --> 00:50:14.377]  That's the top of the black box government.
[00:50:14.777 --> 00:50:16.680]  I mean, that's who runs Homeland Security.
[00:50:16.921 --> 00:50:18.303]  That's who runs the dictatorship.
[00:50:18.343 --> 00:50:18.663]  That's it.
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:20.601]  I mean this whole story stinks.
[00:50:21.061 --> 00:50:22.502]  I don't believe a lick of it.
[00:50:22.882 --> 00:50:29.886]  It's another... Well it's like you said Hastings would be in like bombs and missiles blowing up and huge battles with you and he was just totally relaxed and smiling.
[00:50:30.166 --> 00:50:35.249]  You never saw other journalists that acted like that and you know you've said on record you think Hastings was some type of operative.
[00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:44.354]  I mean he was down in there I mean and another thing that was well though is he thought that you know for a while he thought his wife was almost kind of sent there as a mole too.
[00:50:45.575 --> 00:50:46.536]  Well, of course.
[00:50:46.676 --> 00:50:48.558]  Of course spies are going to have spies on each other.
[00:50:48.638 --> 00:50:49.959]  I mean, this is just out of control.
[00:50:49.979 --> 00:50:51.060]  We're going to go to break.

[00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:05.214]  But InfoWars.com and our team is hot on the trail of finding out the truth.
[00:51:05.534 --> 00:51:08.017]  It doesn't add up what Obama is telling us.
[00:51:08.357 --> 00:51:09.258]  I know that's hard to believe.
[00:51:09.278 --> 00:51:09.819]  He would never lie.

[00:51:54.338 --> 00:51:57.339]  This is Michael Steger, candidate for Congress in San Francisco.
[00:51:58.059 --> 00:51:59.220]  There's a vote this Tuesday.
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:04.581]  If you want to send a message to both political parties and their Wall Street backers, here's your chance.
[00:52:05.221 --> 00:52:07.002]  It's time we impeach Obama.
[00:52:07.642 --> 00:52:09.143]  He's like Dick Cheney, but worse.
[00:52:09.743 --> 00:52:12.284]  Torture, spying, wars, bailouts.
[00:52:12.584 --> 00:52:13.424]  He's a disaster.
[00:52:13.844 --> 00:52:16.125]  He went straight to Wall Street and never turned back.
[00:52:17.188 --> 00:52:21.914]  Next, pass Glass-Steagall just like Franklin Roosevelt, and shut down Wall Street.
[00:52:22.314 --> 00:52:24.256]  It's time to put some bankers in jail.
[00:52:25.097 --> 00:52:34.168]  Then, go back to the policies of John Kennedy, reignite our space program and fusion research, and initiate big projects like water development to end the drought.
[00:52:34.989 --> 00:52:35.710]  You want a future?
[00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:37.652]  You want a nation you can be proud of?
[00:52:38.193 --> 00:52:40.776]  Then it's time to stop complaining and get out and vote.
[00:52:41.277 --> 00:52:42.678]  Tuesday, June 3rd.
[00:52:43.259 --> 00:52:44.040]  It's not about you.
[00:52:44.541 --> 00:52:45.422]  It's about the future.
[00:52:45.802 --> 00:52:47.044]  And now is the time to fight.
[00:52:47.584 --> 00:52:49.767]  This is Michael Steger and I have approved this message.
[00:52:50.248 --> 00:52:52.871]  This message has been paid for by the Michael Steger for Congress campaign.
[00:52:53.706 --> 00:52:56.288]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:56.548 --> 00:53:01.410]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:53:01.671 --> 00:53:09.555]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:53:09.795 --> 00:53:14.098]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:53:14.318 --> 00:53:18.120]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:23.984]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:53:24.224 --> 00:53:27.006]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:53:27.406 --> 00:53:32.610]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:53:32.770 --> 00:53:40.895]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[00:54:23.468 --> 00:54:24.489]  It is Monday, June 2nd, 2014.
[00:54:24.649 --> 00:54:28.252]  We've got a call from Afghanistan whose line keeps dropping.
[00:54:28.272 --> 00:54:29.113]  Probably a sat phone.
[00:54:29.573 --> 00:54:31.935]  Mark in Afghanistan, Army contractor.
[00:54:32.235 --> 00:54:33.296]  What is your take on this?
[00:54:33.316 --> 00:54:35.678]  Then Chris, Joe, Sean, Billy and others.
[00:54:35.718 --> 00:54:36.279]  You're on the air.
[00:54:36.319 --> 00:54:36.999]  Thanks for calling.
[00:54:37.299 --> 00:54:38.661]  What is your take on this story?
[00:54:40.982 --> 00:54:51.271]  Well, I'm uh... I was talking about this thing with a couple of my friends today and one of the guys actually went to that base that the guy left from.
[00:54:52.049 --> 00:55:01.793]  And the guy, when he was there, the guys that were there, the troops that were there were telling him about how the guy walked up, laid his gear down at the gate and walked out.
[00:55:02.814 --> 00:55:07.376]  So you were wondering about whether this story is actual or not.
[00:55:07.416 --> 00:55:07.676]  Yeah.
[00:55:08.016 --> 00:55:08.236]  Yeah.
[00:55:08.876 --> 00:55:11.057]  Guy walked up, laid his gear down and walked away.
[00:55:11.077 --> 00:55:12.158]  Told him I'm going home.
[00:55:12.958 --> 00:55:17.680]  And then the first sergeant there came up to the guy and said, why did you let him leave?
[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:19.020]  And they were like, well, he's a grown man.
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:20.001]  What are we going to do?
[00:55:20.021 --> 00:55:20.301]  Shoot him?
[00:55:21.209 --> 00:55:21.770]  No, not at all.
[00:55:38.982 --> 00:55:42.643]  Well, I mean, that's what they're saying, people in the unit are saying on CNN.
[00:55:43.244 --> 00:55:45.664]  So, this is blowing up in Obama's face.
[00:55:46.325 --> 00:55:49.426]  Caller, Mark in Afghanistan, what does your gut tell you is going on?
[00:55:49.446 --> 00:55:56.548]  Did your buddies that were at this base, did they have any idea what was really going on, more than just saying that it looked like he went AWOL?
[00:55:58.669 --> 00:56:03.271]  No, it just, this guy just flipped out the way that he done out here, you know.
[00:56:04.366 --> 00:56:07.588]  You have one guy that flipped out and went and shot a bunch of people up.
[00:56:07.608 --> 00:56:09.369]  You have this guy that walked away.
[00:56:09.409 --> 00:56:11.171]  You have people out here capping themselves.
[00:56:11.231 --> 00:56:14.993]  I've heard other... I've heard soldiers talking about other soldiers capping themselves.
[00:56:15.033 --> 00:56:18.075]  You know, they're kind of like, well... Why?
[00:56:18.316 --> 00:56:18.736]  You know?
[00:56:18.856 --> 00:56:26.041]  I mean... You know, some... You know, for the people that have been out... I mean, I've been out doing jobs.
[00:56:26.501 --> 00:56:31.144]  I'm an employee of the military-industrial complex, if you will.
[00:56:31.885 --> 00:56:33.426]  And I've been out where...
[00:56:34.422 --> 00:56:37.945]  I don't know.
[00:56:38.025 --> 00:56:40.867]  I just didn't get rattled like some people do, I guess.
[00:56:40.967 --> 00:56:42.688]  Some people can't handle it.
[00:56:43.989 --> 00:56:47.272]  But why they do what they do, I don't know.
[00:56:47.532 --> 00:56:50.994]  Nobody really... Mark, very, very interesting information.
[00:56:51.034 --> 00:56:51.795]  Thank you so much.
[00:56:51.895 --> 00:56:55.718]  Joe in Connecticut, Army vet, what's your take on this?
[00:56:56.365 --> 00:57:05.489]  Hi Alex, one of the first things that I wondered, I mean I've been following this story since the beginning when he did walk away from the base and soldier flipped out and went crazy.
[00:57:05.509 --> 00:57:09.470]  I was wondering how he got off, but he wasn't captured by the Taliban.
[00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:10.691]  Sergeant Biggs touched on this.
[00:57:11.391 --> 00:57:15.753]  The Taliban wouldn't keep him alive for five years unless he assimilated into them.
[00:57:17.493 --> 00:57:21.695]  They would look at him as the infidel, less than nothing, and immediately dispatch him.
[00:57:21.736 --> 00:57:30.400]  I mean, they wouldn't keep him alive for five years, but I find the timing of it so funny because it just totally takes the heat off the VA scandal and everything else.
[00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:31.400]  Bingo!
[00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:34.161]  It totally changes the subject off of VA.
[00:57:34.822 --> 00:57:37.283]  Oh, man, I tell you, these callers really are putting the pieces together for us.
[00:57:37.303 --> 00:57:42.966]  I mean, one of the things, though, too, when I was in Iraq, I remember watching the video of one of the soldiers having his head sawed off.
[00:57:43.706 --> 00:57:47.028]  I mean, that is a chilling image that will never leave my mind.
[00:57:47.428 --> 00:57:53.171]  And the last thing I would ever do was walk off of a base because I know in the back of my head that I could get my head chopped off.
[00:57:53.211 --> 00:57:57.573]  I know if I fell behind in a, in a ruck march, I could get my head chopped off.
[00:57:57.913 --> 00:58:03.256]  You know, I mean, my cousin was telling me about how off of a base is because, you know, you have nothing to fear.
[00:58:04.016 --> 00:58:09.360]  That's what, that's another scary thing is, he walked off the base and didn't even think, alright I'm gonna get my head chopped off.
[00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:13.304]  The Haqqani Network is known as the Sopranos of Afghanistan.
[00:58:13.744 --> 00:58:15.125]  I mean, these are bad guys.
[00:58:15.145 --> 00:58:21.850]  I was about to say, my cousin was given backup to these medevac helicopters, where there are all these burned kids on the road.
[00:58:22.651 --> 00:58:26.795]  And when they got there, they burned their own kids up and then they came out with bombs to try to blow them up.
[00:58:27.055 --> 00:58:29.837]  But they'd already figured it out and landed their helicopters further away.
[00:58:29.877 --> 00:58:32.960]  But, I mean, that's the total brainwashing we're talking about here.
[00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:34.241]  Amazing.
[00:58:34.281 --> 00:58:35.562]  Thank you, Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs.
[00:58:35.602 --> 00:58:36.723]  Thank you, Joe in Connecticut.
[00:58:37.264 --> 00:58:38.485]  Yeah, this diverts off.
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:45.247]  I guess it's the new Malaysian plane story from the VA scandal that was absolutely exposing him.
[00:58:45.267 --> 00:58:48.030]  Chris, Sean, and Billy, your calls are coming up.
[00:58:48.050 --> 00:58:48.471]  Stay with us.
[00:58:49.172 --> 00:58:49.833]  Oh, and then Pchenik.
[00:58:50.133 --> 00:58:51.715]  Pchenik's coming up, folks.
[00:58:51.755 --> 00:58:53.117]  Pchenik wants to chime in.
[00:58:53.137 --> 00:58:55.039]  8 after next hour.
[00:58:55.159 --> 00:58:58.723]  Then we've got other people coming up.
[00:58:59.628 --> 00:59:06.693]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:59:06.793 --> 00:59:08.955]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:59:09.135 --> 00:59:14.238]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:59:14.418 --> 00:59:19.362]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:59:19.582 --> 00:59:22.643]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:59:22.903 --> 00:59:26.764]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:59:26.984 --> 00:59:31.225]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:59:31.285 --> 00:59:41.348]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:59:41.528 --> 00:59:44.049]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs
[00:59:44.189 --> 00:59:45.090]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:45.110 --> 00:59:46.751]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:14.605 --> 01:00:18.767]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:19.447 --> 01:00:20.248]  You want answers?
[01:00:21.028 --> 01:00:21.928]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:22.569 --> 01:00:26.210]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:30.812]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:47.784]  The Bo Bergdahl story, the last article written by... He had more articles coming out.
[01:00:48.304 --> 01:00:49.505]  Michael Hastings was on this.
[01:00:49.805 --> 01:00:53.187]  Notice we have one of his good buddies, Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, working for InfoWars.
[01:00:53.788 --> 01:00:56.630]  He's been saying these are connected for a long time since he died.
[01:00:57.330 --> 01:00:59.572]  I don't know, six, eight months ago, however long ago it was, maybe a year.
[01:00:59.612 --> 01:01:00.152]  Time flies.
[01:01:00.492 --> 01:01:02.634]  How long has Hastings been dead now, Joe?
[01:01:02.694 --> 01:01:05.716]  It'll be a year June 18th, so we're coming right up on it right now.
[01:01:05.916 --> 01:01:11.080]  It's almost a year, and we gotta go back to all those shows where you mentioned it might have been the Bo Bergdahl case.
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.541]  I remember rolling my eyes.
[01:01:12.841 --> 01:01:14.502]  What's a POW have to do with it?
[01:01:14.902 --> 01:01:17.524]  I mean, this is really getting serious now, folks.
[01:01:17.544 --> 01:01:19.966]  And as usual, we're right on top of what's going on.
[01:01:20.466 --> 01:01:23.468]  We just haven't figured it out yet, because we're always in the middle of it to begin with.
[01:01:24.209 --> 01:01:28.331]  But Leanne McAdoo's riding shotgun, Steve Pchenik's coming up to give his take, and Leanne and...
[01:01:30.012 --> 01:01:31.793]  All right, Alex.
[01:01:32.253 --> 01:01:43.396]  Thank you for this provocative, truth-based journalism that you're doing this morning.
[01:01:43.436 --> 01:01:44.816]  And hats off to Sgt.
[01:01:44.876 --> 01:01:47.417]  Bugs for his service.
[01:01:47.457 --> 01:01:48.117]  My apologies.
[01:01:48.917 --> 01:01:49.177]  Thank you.
[01:01:49.237 --> 01:01:49.798]  That's all right, brother.
[01:01:49.818 --> 01:01:50.698]  What do you think is going on here?
[01:01:51.488 --> 01:01:52.489]  Couple of factoids.
[01:01:52.730 --> 01:02:01.782]  One, whenever this purported father, Robert Burgdahl, is making his announcement and the wife is speaking, look at him in the background.
[01:02:01.882 --> 01:02:02.443]  Observe.
[01:02:02.904 --> 01:02:06.589]  He has a very pronounced closing of his right eye.
[01:02:07.142 --> 01:02:12.764]  Leaving the left eye open specifically, almost like a wink and a nod signal to somebody.
[01:02:13.225 --> 01:02:18.987]  Don't know who, but it's very obvious he's communicating in some sort of fashion to alert someone.
[01:02:19.107 --> 01:02:28.371]  It's just like in the show Homeland, how Sergeant Brody does the same thing as finger tappings when he was sending the videos back home when he was being held captive.
[01:02:28.391 --> 01:02:29.091]  It's the same thing.
[01:02:29.131 --> 01:02:32.493]  I think he's kind of sending some kind of code over that video doing that.
[01:02:33.823 --> 01:02:34.543]  Absolutely.
[01:02:35.124 --> 01:02:51.652]  Also, when you look at Hegel's coming out and trying to claim that capitulation and negotiation with terrorists is merely hostage negotiation, it speaks to the lies that they're trying to fabricate in this rhetoric-based story.
[01:02:52.327 --> 01:03:16.418]  Followed by Susan Rice's coming forward, Kim hauling around, stuttering her lack of credibility based upon her lies perpetrated in the Benghazi scam with Hillary Clinton, just really have destroyed any pretense of credibility she may have ever had, and she seems to be an agent of Valerie Jenrette in the White House, the real talking hand for the puppet Obama.
[01:03:17.085 --> 01:03:35.715]  But these are really things that fly in the face, and like you say, his perfect speaking of Pashtun really just defied any concept of normality for an American unless they have absolutely been schooled in that particular language for a lengthy time.
[01:03:36.618 --> 01:03:38.299]  Yeah, I agree with you 100% on that.
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:47.587]  And that leans towards him being an infiltrator for some agency, not actually being a double or going over to the Afghans.
[01:03:48.747 --> 01:04:01.998]  And so in my gut, that tells me this is part of a whole new rollout that, oh look, the Tea Party and the soldiers are Al Qaeda, which we see them actually trying to promote right now in the news, flipping homeland security onto the American people.
[01:04:02.478 --> 01:04:04.339]  Your take on that, Chris, and then Joe Biggs.
[01:04:09.250 --> 01:04:14.174]  Agent Provocateur masked as a jihadi terrorist in truth.
[01:04:16.072 --> 01:04:16.652]  That's what I think.
[01:04:16.672 --> 01:04:17.972]  Well, that caller really says it well.
[01:04:18.353 --> 01:04:21.573]  Agent provocateur, masked as a jihadi terrorist.
[01:04:21.613 --> 01:04:22.033]  Joe Biggs?
[01:04:22.053 --> 01:04:30.115]  Well, one of the other things, though, that Lee and I spoke about yesterday, or the day before, was that maybe this is really all about the father.
[01:04:30.175 --> 01:04:40.038]  Maybe he's the one who is the actual, you know, the operative, and did something, and the son had to go in almost as, what was it we were saying yesterday?
[01:04:40.638 --> 01:04:46.921]  Remember that we were saying that we were thinking that the father was the one who was actually working for the CIA and he had done something.
[01:04:47.201 --> 01:04:51.584]  As you can see when he's talking to the president, he has that snarl look, you know, almost kind of like, ha, you know.
[01:04:51.604 --> 01:04:53.705]  He had to negotiate to get his son back.
[01:04:53.725 --> 01:04:59.308]  Well, bottom line, they're covering something up and this is distracting from the VA scandal and I don't believe a word of it.
[01:04:59.328 --> 01:05:01.349]  And now we remember Hastings was hot on the trail of this.
[01:05:01.749 --> 01:05:02.789]  I mean, this is big.
[01:05:03.090 --> 01:05:07.052]  We'll be right back and we'll get more from Leanne McAdoo and Steve Pucinich and Joe Biggs.
[01:05:07.072 --> 01:05:07.532]  Stay with us.
[01:05:09.793 --> 01:05:10.614]  I don't know what it is.
[01:05:10.854 --> 01:05:12.615]  Ralph just won't pay any attention to me.
[01:05:12.715 --> 01:05:16.657]  When he comes home from work, all he ever does is play video games and go to sleep.
[01:05:16.818 --> 01:05:18.098]  Just like I don't even exist.
[01:05:18.439 --> 01:05:20.240]  Oh Betty, that's just awful.
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:21.581]  Does this seem familiar?
[01:05:21.761 --> 01:05:24.362]  If the answer to this question is yes, then listen carefully.
[01:05:24.483 --> 01:05:29.726]  Toxic pesticides, GMO foods and additives, BPA plastics, contaminated water supplies.
[01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:34.809]  Many of these toxic additives are deliberately engineered to attack and weaken human masculinity.
[01:05:34.949 --> 01:05:37.391]  It's part of the eugenics population control movement.
[01:05:37.651 --> 01:05:38.111]  Look it up.
[01:05:38.332 --> 01:05:45.037]  If men are more interested in online gaming than they are in their wives, a serious population crisis is soon to follow.

[01:06:27.214 --> 01:06:33.139]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote homeless security by sticking our hands down on the streets?

[01:06:48.550 --> 01:06:50.611]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:06:50.671 --> 01:06:51.772]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:06:52.092 --> 01:07:00.837]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[01:07:10.145 --> 01:07:11.906]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[01:07:12.447 --> 01:07:19.411]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[01:07:19.871 --> 01:07:30.298]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[01:07:30.719 --> 01:07:39.925]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[01:07:40.665 --> 01:07:44.086]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[01:07:44.726 --> 01:07:48.146]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[01:07:48.487 --> 01:07:50.047]  Experience the new formula.
[01:07:50.547 --> 01:07:52.527]  Experience the ancient purity.

[01:07:54.448 --> 01:07:55.828]  Survival Shield X2.

[01:07:59.429 --> 01:08:03.389]  X2 from InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:08:11.516 --> 01:08:13.724]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:14.307 --> 01:08:17.097]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:25.345 --> 01:08:32.387]  We are now well into the second hour of this live Monday, the second day of June 2014.
[01:08:33.587 --> 01:08:36.928]  Worldwide transmission coming up at the start of the next segment.
[01:08:36.948 --> 01:08:46.311]  We're going to have John Rappaport, who was on with us on the Sunday show for like two segments, on for a lot more today to cover the waterfront of propaganda, disinformation and more.
[01:08:46.811 --> 01:08:52.873]  Popping in on very short notice is Dr. Steve Pachinick, former head of psychological operations for the State Department.
[01:08:53.914 --> 01:09:00.681]  Co-author with Tom Clancy and kind of a master negotiator in his own right.
[01:09:01.342 --> 01:09:05.907]  And listen, I don't know his take on this Bo Bergdahl Army report.
[01:09:06.568 --> 01:09:09.711]  I just know that when it all happened, I went, haven't I heard that before?
[01:09:09.731 --> 01:09:15.437]  And then it was the story Hastings was working on, he'd already done one, when his car got blown up.
[01:09:16.283 --> 01:09:17.083]  Out in California.
[01:09:17.864 --> 01:09:21.366]  And then the wife was getting threatened and everything, and then she goes on TV and says everything's fine.
[01:09:21.886 --> 01:09:27.449]  She's the head, you know, minion at the National Security Council, doesn't get any more high level than that.
[01:09:27.469 --> 01:09:31.010]  I mean, you know, in those meetings with like eight people, she's in there.
[01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:35.873]  I mean, I think both of them have the cutouts of spies of some agency.
[01:09:36.353 --> 01:09:39.635]  And Biggs knew him, you know, Esquire articles, in serious combat.
[01:09:40.035 --> 01:09:41.896]  And he said all other media would basically freak out.
[01:09:41.936 --> 01:09:45.638]  Biggs just loved it, was smiling and enjoying, you know, rockets falling all around him.
[01:09:46.538 --> 01:09:51.501]  Uh, or, you know, Biggs was saying that about, uh, Hastings, Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs who works for mfoldwars.com.
[01:09:51.981 --> 01:10:00.226]  And now you have Bo Bergdahl and his dad, if you just joined us, uh, his own buddies saying, no, he walked off the base.
[01:10:00.246 --> 01:10:00.886]  He went AWOL.
[01:10:01.347 --> 01:10:04.828]  Well, Biggs was telling me that days ago when this first broke and I said, I can't find that.
[01:10:05.049 --> 01:10:06.489]  We're not, we're not going to go with that.
[01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:08.450]  Well, now it came out what Biggs said.
[01:10:08.491 --> 01:10:10.592]  Biggs has friends that were in the unit with him.
[01:10:11.372 --> 01:10:13.394]  And we've had contractors calling in saying, no, no.
[01:10:13.414 --> 01:10:14.395]  I mean, we know people on the base.
[01:10:14.415 --> 01:10:15.075]  Same thing happened.
[01:10:15.115 --> 01:10:15.476]  He left.
[01:10:15.516 --> 01:10:16.216]  He said he was going.
[01:10:16.577 --> 01:10:17.818]  Same thing CNN's reporting.
[01:10:18.198 --> 01:10:19.779]  So there's a lot of issues here.
[01:10:19.799 --> 01:10:21.861]  I want Leanne McAdoo to be able to ask some questions.
[01:10:22.482 --> 01:10:27.666]  And I also want to get Joe Biggs to be able to ask some and kind of recap this.
[01:10:28.206 --> 01:10:34.332]  But just briefly, because I appreciate you popping in on short notice, you were just on the Sunday show, Dr. Steve Pachinick.
[01:10:35.544 --> 01:10:37.085]  What do you know about this?
[01:10:37.105 --> 01:10:38.466]  Because sometimes you know what happened.
[01:10:38.887 --> 01:10:40.048]  Or what is your take on it?
[01:10:40.128 --> 01:10:47.254]  Are we wrong to think this doesn't make sense with the CIA boss in Kabul getting his cover blown by Obama two weeks ago?
[01:10:47.674 --> 01:10:48.855]  And then now this happens.
[01:10:49.235 --> 01:10:54.920]  Is this guy a deep cover infiltrator into the Taliban, into the Akhani network?
[01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:56.281]  Dr. Pachinik, what do you know?
[01:10:56.641 --> 01:11:05.968]  Well, what I know is I'm going to give you a very special, unusual story that will show you the hypocrisy and inconsistency of this administration.
[01:11:06.228 --> 01:11:11.612]  One month ago, I was served a subpoena by the FBI on behalf of the U.S.
[01:11:11.672 --> 01:11:16.956]  Attorney of the Southern District of Florida, by the name of Brian Fraser, at the Bahasta
[01:11:17.697 --> 01:11:18.579]  We're good.
[01:11:33.525 --> 01:11:49.200]  35 years ago as US Military Officer and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State and I was brought in on charges of criminal charges for doing exactly the opposite and being consistent with our policy of no negotiation with the Red Brigade terrorists and as a result
[01:11:50.023 --> 01:11:53.346]  The Aldo Moro, the Prime Minister of Italy, died.
[01:11:54.046 --> 01:12:10.058]  35 years later, the State Department and the Justice Department, under the orders of Obama, has ordered me to appear before the court just one week ago, May 27th, 2014, at 10 a.m., in front of Brian Fraser, in front of an Italian prosecutor,
[01:12:10.698 --> 01:12:24.972]  At the behest of the Italian prosecutor with the overlying notion that I will be committed for criminal indictment if I don't reveal what I had done in saving Italy and refusing to negotiate with terrorists.
[01:12:25.092 --> 01:12:29.316]  So what this shows, and what this just happened to me, and you're the only one to know now,
[01:12:29.796 --> 01:12:31.098]  The case number is here.
[01:12:31.158 --> 01:12:34.242]  It's 14 MC 21380 Altoonaga.
[01:12:34.622 --> 01:12:36.004]  The judge was Altoonaga.
[01:12:36.424 --> 01:12:39.488]  The attorney general was Brian Fraser.
[01:12:39.648 --> 01:12:47.678]  And I was brought up on charges that I potentially have killed a prime minister because I refused to negotiate in a time of war.
[01:12:48.579 --> 01:12:49.040]  I don't know.
[01:13:10.896 --> 01:13:18.346]  Negotiated with a terrorist, allowed a deserter, this is a deserter, this is not an infiltrator, to leave his post.
[01:13:18.586 --> 01:13:22.291]  He should have been jailed, stockaded, and incarcerated.
[01:13:22.512 --> 01:13:24.394]  And he is not a prisoner of war.
[01:13:24.434 --> 01:13:25.375]  He is a deserter.
[01:13:26.076 --> 01:13:27.217]  He should have been tried.
[01:13:27.537 --> 01:13:37.125]  I, in turn, have been tried for saving my country, saving Italy, and I've had to pay $20,000 to a lawyer just to show up to explain why I did that.
[01:13:37.145 --> 01:13:40.808]  By the way, Dr. Pucinich, I've got to interrupt you, and we'll go to our guests at 33 after.
[01:13:40.848 --> 01:13:41.769]  This is too important.
[01:13:42.129 --> 01:13:46.933]  But for people that don't know, Dr. Pucinich will never talk about this on air, but I've gone and checked into him over the years.
[01:13:46.953 --> 01:13:52.318]  He's in the London Independent, the BBC, and Le Figaro in France, and the biggest papers in Italy.
[01:13:53.018 --> 01:14:05.725]  That where they say Dr. Steve Pucinich killed the Prime Minister by manipulating the Red Brigade and not negotiating and then they killed him, which is crazy because how is not negotiating killing him when they're the ones that killed him?
[01:14:06.205 --> 01:14:09.146]  So that's in the papers 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 5 years ago.
[01:14:10.427 --> 01:14:13.429]  I mean, you can look up Dr. Steve Pucinich, and that's pretty much what you get on him.
[01:14:14.510 --> 01:14:17.152]  I mean, you know, running those operations with the Army and others.
[01:14:17.672 --> 01:14:21.575]  And of course, he helped found Delta Force with General Boykin, who's also a listener of the show.
[01:14:22.135 --> 01:14:26.498]  And what I can't believe here is, we get him on about this, and he drops this bombshell.
[01:14:26.518 --> 01:14:28.499]  You didn't tell us that, Dr. Pucinich.
[01:14:28.519 --> 01:14:28.619]  No.
[01:14:28.679 --> 01:14:30.621]  Was it sealed, what happened in the court?
[01:14:30.701 --> 01:14:38.346]  Because I couldn't say a word to you or anybody else, but since I appeared on May 27th in front of a prosecutor who was flown over from Italy,
[01:14:38.926 --> 01:14:40.027]  We had an interpreter.
[01:14:40.047 --> 01:14:41.808]  This is all American tax dollars.
[01:14:41.888 --> 01:14:43.789]  Plus, we had Brian Fraser sitting there.
[01:14:43.889 --> 01:14:44.949]  I had to hire a lawyer for $20,000.
[01:14:45.010 --> 01:14:48.471]  But what I want to say, was this under a national security order?
[01:14:48.491 --> 01:14:50.052]  Because I don't want to violate one of those.
[01:14:50.072 --> 01:14:51.773]  No, it's not under national security orders.
[01:14:51.793 --> 01:15:07.402]  As a matter of fact, this is a totally illegal procedure because they brought in a former military officer in a civilian court and they didn't even know I was a military officer at the time because I was a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Counterterrorism and Management.
[01:15:07.842 --> 01:15:17.428]  And so what happened is the military, the CIA, our Justice Department, State Department completely abandoned me as a former officer of the military.
[01:15:17.769 --> 01:15:21.511]  And now they're saying that they always leave, they never leave anybody behind.
[01:15:21.651 --> 01:15:22.832]  It's an absolute lie.
[01:15:22.932 --> 01:15:24.373]  General Dempsey should resign.
[01:15:24.993 --> 01:15:26.634]  I was at Principal Hostage Negotiation.
[01:15:42.366 --> 01:15:49.690]  By the way, you're on record as the head psychiatrist over the PSYOP to be able to get the Camp David Accords as well.
[01:15:49.710 --> 01:15:52.111]  I was the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State and one of the first.
[01:15:52.131 --> 01:15:55.332]  I had just saved over 500 hostages in the Hanafi Muslim.
[01:15:55.733 --> 01:16:04.177]  I was asked by Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, at the behest of Jimmy Carter, and at the behest of Warren Christopher, to go over to Italy.
[01:16:04.637 --> 01:16:07.138]  It was Prime Minister Kosyga, he was the Interior Minister.
[01:16:07.418 --> 01:16:08.239]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:16:08.279 --> 01:16:10.880]  Are they going after you now because of what you're saying on this show?
[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:10.940]  No.
[01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:13.001]  I know they're purging a lot of people right now.
[01:16:13.161 --> 01:16:18.864]  This was before... No, no, I know this happened a long time ago, but they're going to use... Why are they coming after you now is what I'm saying.
[01:16:18.884 --> 01:16:35.934]  I have no idea because they believe that as a result of my actions of no negotiation with the terrorists, which is exactly what we've been doing our entire life, where I've saved countless thousands of Italians, I've saved the country of Italy from being totally devalued and destabilized.
[01:16:36.714 --> 01:16:42.137]  For those that don't know, the Communists were going to take Italy over at that point, and you are credited with stopping them.
[01:16:42.317 --> 01:16:46.659]  And the Communists, the PCI under Berlinger, refused to support the Red Brigade.
[01:16:46.739 --> 01:16:51.962]  So what you have is a situation where the President abandoned a soldier like me.
[01:16:52.242 --> 01:16:55.184]  The military, I had requested that our military help me.
[01:16:55.504 --> 01:17:14.772]  They abandoned me, the CIA abandoned me, you're talking about Justice abandoned me, you're talking about State Department Kerry, and in contrast they're telling you how great they are in a situation where you have a deserter and a man who didn't serve our country and who became an ally of the Al-Qaeda unit of the
[01:17:14.872 --> 01:17:20.136]  I know, and they're spinning it, and his dad speaks perfect Farsi.
[01:17:20.156 --> 01:17:23.078]  Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs says none of this smells right to him.
[01:17:23.158 --> 01:17:26.601]  Joe, Leanne McAdoo, do you have any questions for Dr. Pachinick?
[01:17:28.015 --> 01:17:28.215]  Go ahead.
[01:17:28.995 --> 01:17:37.817]  Oh, well, one of the things I wanted to ask, though, was, you know, how many American lives do you think are going to be endangered now by us negotiating with terrorists now?
[01:17:37.857 --> 01:17:42.198]  My answer, let me just say this, Dr. Pachetnik, my answer is every U.S.
[01:17:42.298 --> 01:17:43.758]  officer, every U.S.
[01:17:43.838 --> 01:17:55.981]  noncommissioned individual, and every covert operative from 15 different intelligence units, including the CIA, the NSA, the NGA, and almost every American who's out there serving our country.
[01:17:57.353 --> 01:17:58.495]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:17:58.515 --> 01:18:01.358]  I mean, like you said, the president should be impeached on this.
[01:18:01.758 --> 01:18:04.541]  I mean, this is just... What is Obama doing?
[01:18:04.581 --> 01:18:06.003]  It seems like he's going crazy.
[01:18:06.567 --> 01:18:10.088]  Well, I don't know if he's going crazy, but he's completely incompetent.
[01:18:10.308 --> 01:18:18.491]  From the Benghazi issue, to the Osama Bin Laden, to Newtown, to the Santa Barbara, to the fact that he keeps on... He has no idea what he's doing.
[01:18:18.971 --> 01:18:19.872]  He is incompetent.
[01:18:20.272 --> 01:18:26.154]  In any situation, in any government, I've served five different presidents and continue to work with our Defense Department.
[01:18:26.694 --> 01:18:28.475]  I have never seen such incompetency.
[01:18:28.515 --> 01:18:32.236]  It has nothing to do with the Democrat, Republican, or whether he's black or white.
[01:18:32.616 --> 01:18:34.037]  The man has never had any
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:53.053]  He's also got a bunch of foundation heads who've never even been in the military, and I'm not putting down that they're women, but it is a bunch of women, I mean, that he's got running the State Department and everything who just want to have... I mean, it seems crazy.
[01:18:53.513 --> 01:19:03.262]  Well, there's no excuse for John Kerry, who's a senator and a combat veteran in Vietnam, not to know our policy and to have accepted it.
[01:19:03.342 --> 01:19:11.390]  There's absolutely no excuse for Chuck Hagel, whom I supported as Secretary of Defense, to allow himself and allow General Dempsey
[01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:13.411]  Okay, let me stop right there.
[01:19:13.451 --> 01:19:14.372]  We're going to skip this.
[01:19:40.282 --> 01:19:41.442]  We're going to skip this network break.
[01:19:42.063 --> 01:19:43.523]  Let's just skip the network break.
[01:19:43.923 --> 01:19:46.664]  I want to bring Leanne McAdoo in, who's been holding patiently in the wings.
[01:19:47.064 --> 01:19:48.985]  She was hopping up and down Saturday about this.
[01:19:49.045 --> 01:19:50.286]  I wasn't really paying attention to it.
[01:19:50.586 --> 01:19:54.187]  I'm glad she raised it to my attention and that Biggs did as well.
[01:19:54.547 --> 01:19:56.808]  Leanne, what are your questions or comments for Dr. Pichenning?
[01:19:57.930 --> 01:20:05.137]  Well, it kind of seems like they're turning against Obama, almost setting him up for impeachment at this point.
[01:20:05.177 --> 01:20:10.802]  They're done using him to create chaos, as he's done a very good job of creating chaos.
[01:20:11.523 --> 01:20:15.786]  But now, they immediately, in less than 24 hours, threw him under the bus.
[01:20:15.806 --> 01:20:17.748]  So it's almost like they're setting him up for something.
[01:20:18.329 --> 01:20:21.191]  But what I'm curious about is why these particular
[01:20:22.052 --> 01:20:26.455]  Uh, terrorists were released from Gitmo because they're part of a different network.
[01:20:26.515 --> 01:20:28.396]  Now, obviously, we need to do a little bit more research.
[01:20:28.756 --> 01:20:30.017]  We'll have this for the nightly news.
[01:20:30.517 --> 01:20:36.980]  But there were other Taliban leaders that were part of the network that was holding Bergdahl that they could have negotiated for.
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:38.121]  So why these?
[01:20:38.561 --> 01:20:39.762]  Why these particular guys?
[01:20:39.782 --> 01:20:41.503]  Yeah, we need to look at those people closely.
[01:20:41.563 --> 01:20:44.705]  Why does this bother, you know, working to negotiate for these guys?
[01:20:48.573 --> 01:20:50.495]  Well, I think you asked a brilliant question.
[01:20:50.615 --> 01:20:56.720]  First of all, the people who really held, as I understood, Bergdahl were not part of the Al Qaeda group.
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:57.541]  They were Haqqani.
[01:20:57.661 --> 01:21:01.745]  Haqqani is a spinoff of the CIA and the Pakistani ISI.
[01:21:02.445 --> 01:21:05.128]  And we, ironically, have been working with them, or the U.S.
[01:21:05.148 --> 01:21:07.590]  government's been working with Haqqani for a long time.
[01:21:07.730 --> 01:21:22.064]  So, this administration had a very good idea of what was happening to Bergdahl for a long time, but your point about releasing these terrorists, who were not part of the Haqqani, they are real, online killers, and very professional killers.
[01:21:22.104 --> 01:21:26.208]  You've killed thousands of Shiites, and when they go out again, they will kill again.
[01:21:26.648 --> 01:21:27.729]  There's no issue there.
[01:21:27.849 --> 01:21:32.873]  You release a terrorist and you get a promise from Qatar that they will be fine.
[01:21:32.953 --> 01:21:36.135]  Qatar is a place where, you know, you can buy and sell anything.
[01:21:36.175 --> 01:21:37.236]  It's like Casablanca.
[01:21:37.636 --> 01:21:39.858]  Well, let me raise this to Dr. Pichetti.
[01:21:39.878 --> 01:21:43.601]  But in Qatar, though, that's the spot where they send soldiers for mid-tour leave.
[01:21:44.181 --> 01:21:51.023]  You know, so you're going to have soldiers in Qatar, and you're going to have these five terrorists who hate America running around out there having a field day.
[01:21:51.203 --> 01:21:51.423]  Correct.
[01:21:51.483 --> 01:21:55.424]  And then how can we guarantee that this government can even, you know, keep dibs on these guys?
[01:21:55.484 --> 01:21:56.585]  I mean... Let me throw this out.
[01:21:56.625 --> 01:21:57.405]  Let me throw this out.
[01:21:57.565 --> 01:22:01.886]  Well, they may have been turned or something, but the point is, we don't know that, or we can get the genetics take on it.
[01:22:02.186 --> 01:22:02.966]  Here's my issue.
[01:22:03.226 --> 01:22:04.627]  We're seeing a public reset.
[01:22:05.347 --> 01:22:06.048]  We're good to go.
[01:22:25.589 --> 01:22:32.370]  Well, what's happening is Al Qaeda is becoming stronger and stronger and Obama can't admit that and that was the issue with Benghazi.
[01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:34.591]  What happened in Benghazi was that we didn't have really an embassy there.
[01:22:53.706 --> 01:23:00.647]  We had a house where we were interrogating the terrorists and basically shipping guns into Syria, which is what we're doing again.
[01:23:01.408 --> 01:23:07.869]  We have no policy, and I think what the person said correctly is, we're not imploding the President.
[01:23:07.949 --> 01:23:09.729]  The President is imploding himself.
[01:23:10.089 --> 01:23:12.090]  He has no control of what's going on.
[01:23:12.270 --> 01:23:14.090]  The CIA has no real intelligence.
[01:23:14.670 --> 01:23:19.291]  They're shipping guns into the system and they're increasing the volatility of the area.
[01:23:19.995 --> 01:23:22.656]  By really incompetency.
[01:23:22.996 --> 01:23:27.838]  And what's happening now is we have to probably go in at some point in order to control it.
[01:23:27.879 --> 01:23:36.502]  But right now we have CIA operators in Jordan who are determining which terrorists can go in there and who are moderate, which is absolutely absurd.
[01:23:37.043 --> 01:23:38.623]  Once you're a terrorist, you're a terrorist.
[01:23:38.643 --> 01:23:42.505]  There is no such thing as a moderate or extreme terrorist, if you're willing to use violence.
[01:23:42.905 --> 01:23:43.025]  Sure.
[01:24:01.601 --> 01:24:06.826]  Well, I mean, they're clearly going with the order-out-of-chaos model, but there's not even order they're taking out of the chaos.
[01:24:07.587 --> 01:24:15.596]  And that's what, I guess, the British intelligence head said a few months ago, was that they've never seen such disjointed lack of a message.
[01:24:15.616 --> 01:24:20.801]  And I think it's because the military-industrial-complex interests and the big banks that own it, they just want more conflict.
[01:24:21.201 --> 01:24:24.265]  So I guess in the final equation, they do know what they're doing, Dr. Pachinic.
[01:24:24.765 --> 01:24:25.305]  Not really.
[01:24:25.325 --> 01:24:37.888]  What's happening is, even though the military-industrial complex exists, what's really happening is we're getting an escalation of chaos, and we're getting what we're not looking at, quite frankly, my friend, is in China.
[01:24:38.068 --> 01:24:46.710]  And China is becoming more and more of an aggravation on our Asian front, and they're engaging themselves with Vietnam, the Philippines,
[01:24:48.391 --> 01:24:50.292]  Let me ask you that, Dr. Pachinik, because you raised it.
[01:24:50.312 --> 01:24:54.775]  I know you've been to North Korea, you name it, and worked with the South Korean government and worked with the Japanese government.
[01:24:55.716 --> 01:25:04.882]  Expanding on that, and you reported last year live for us there, you were a few years ago saying, watch China, watch China, and I kind of halfway rolled my eyes, because they're already taking us over economically.
[01:25:05.283 --> 01:25:07.024]  Why on earth would they want to mess with Japan?
[01:25:07.384 --> 01:25:09.826]  Now they're saying, we'll take islands of Japan.
[01:25:10.126 --> 01:25:11.467]  We'll take islands of the Philippines.
[01:25:11.747 --> 01:25:14.628]  They're now threatening to basically invade Vietnam.
[01:25:15.008 --> 01:25:20.150]  I mean, what's going on in China that's got them this aggressive when historically they've not acted like this?
[01:25:20.710 --> 01:25:22.711]  China has always watched our leaders.
[01:25:23.011 --> 01:25:25.753]  When it worked with Nixon, it was very much afraid of him.
[01:25:25.973 --> 01:25:29.094]  When they had to deal with Bush Senior, they were very much afraid of him.
[01:25:29.274 --> 01:25:31.835]  When we have a strong leader, they pull back.
[01:25:32.275 --> 01:25:35.977]  When you have a weak leader, you have people like Putin who will annex.
[01:25:36.713 --> 01:25:42.260]  Crimea and you will have a Chinese leadership say okay now we will go into the Spratly Islands.
[01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:49.770]  The reason they're going into that area where we we have a national interest or a world strategic interest is because it's oil.
[01:25:50.171 --> 01:25:54.757]  It's oil and gas which Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan claim.
[01:25:55.297 --> 01:26:08.329]  It's been a claim for 20 years, but now that they see we have an incompetent president, who should really resign, or be impeached, they will move forward, because they know nothing can happen, and think that can not do very much about it at this point.
[01:26:08.729 --> 01:26:10.531]  All they can act is just negotiate it.
[01:26:10.951 --> 01:26:19.759]  Yeah, for those that don't know, the Chinese have been with arms, taking over oil rigs and stuff already, so, I mean, this is really escalating fast.
[01:26:19.899 --> 01:26:20.180]  Correct.
[01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:26.683]  And at the same time, we're incredibly escalating into a chaotic state in the Middle East.
[01:26:26.863 --> 01:26:31.145]  In short, we have a president who doesn't belong there, who has no idea what he's doing.
[01:26:31.586 --> 01:26:37.789]  We have a national security advisor who has already failed in Libya, lied to the public in Benghazi.
[01:26:38.269 --> 01:26:40.851]  And it's really not a qualified to make any statements.
[01:26:40.871 --> 01:26:43.172]  We have a Secretary of State who's totally incompetent.
[01:26:43.632 --> 01:26:45.793]  Well, here's my final question to Dr. Pachinic.
[01:26:46.194 --> 01:26:48.775]  ...to global warming and has no idea of what he's doing.
[01:26:49.135 --> 01:26:51.577]  And we have Hagel, who's done absolutely nothing.
[01:26:51.697 --> 01:26:56.540]  In short, we do not have a government, but we're paying a lot of money for incompetency.
[01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:01.963]  Leanne McAdoo, Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, final questions for Dr. Pachinic or final statements?
[01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:11.366]  Well, I think, you know, for me personally, I really, I feel like they, the globalists, they're done with Obama.
[01:27:11.566 --> 01:27:25.397]  I mean, I really feel like he has created so much chaos and now with just the media kind of turning on him and not just accepting the story, this guy's a hero, let's move on, you know, this is big.
[01:27:25.417 --> 01:27:28.320]  And the fact that he did all of this without going through the proper
[01:27:29.020 --> 01:27:31.302]  I agree, but don't think the networks behind Obama are going to not give up power.
[01:27:31.322 --> 01:27:34.345]  They could stage a false flag and try to use that to get their butt out of the fire.
[01:27:34.385 --> 01:27:35.166]  Biggs, any other comments?
[01:27:35.186 --> 01:27:37.328]  Because I want to get Patrionic's take on a false flag.
[01:27:53.243 --> 01:28:02.386]  Oh, I'm just curious as to whether or not they're going to somehow spin this to make him a hero, or in fact, are they going to actually punish him as a deserter like he should be?
[01:28:02.406 --> 01:28:07.348]  They're going to spin him as a hero, but the irony of what you just brought out is an excellent point.
[01:28:07.388 --> 01:28:14.271]  The more they make him a hero, I can guarantee you from his own personal dynamics, and I've dealt with a lot of hostages who were not heroes.
[01:28:15.693 --> 01:28:18.417]  None of the homeboys are treasonous as this gentleman was.
[01:28:18.917 --> 01:28:20.860]  He will commit suicide at some point.
[01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:22.462]  There's no question about it.
[01:28:22.602 --> 01:28:24.805]  Because he knows very well he was treasonous.
[01:28:25.245 --> 01:28:26.667]  He was A.W.O.L.
[01:28:26.868 --> 01:28:28.209]  and he consorted with the enemy.
[01:28:28.229 --> 01:28:33.016]  I've never met a hostage who could not speak English after years of being incarcerated.
[01:28:33.576 --> 01:28:37.218]  Yeah, they chop people's heads off all the time, but he's left unscathed.
[01:28:55.087 --> 01:29:07.840]  An inability to speak English tells me that he went completely to the other side, willing to... And by the way, his dad knows that, because he said, you need to, you know, like a diver coming up too quick, you know, you need, you know, you could end up dying.
[01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:10.963]  So I guess the army doctors are telling him that, Dr. Pachinik?
[01:29:11.323 --> 01:29:20.531]  Well, what's happening is his dad basically intimidated Obama and the administration because what happened is this man should never have been recruited into the army.
[01:29:20.631 --> 01:29:22.272]  This was a very sweet boy.
[01:29:22.332 --> 01:29:28.998]  He was an ex-ballet dancer, dancing in the Nutcracker Suite, and he was a free spirit who grew up in a cabin lodge.
[01:29:29.418 --> 01:29:30.519]  Yeah, he was a saw gunner.
[01:29:50.851 --> 01:29:52.152]  Dr. Pachinik, we're out of time.
[01:29:52.212 --> 01:29:53.152]  Thank you for the short notice.
[01:29:53.172 --> 01:29:54.253]  StevePachinik.com.
[01:29:55.513 --> 01:29:56.934]  Thank you, Leon McAdoo, Joe Biggs.
[01:29:57.214 --> 01:29:57.815]  We'll have more.
[01:29:58.155 --> 01:29:58.655]  Stay with us.
[01:29:58.695 --> 01:29:59.856]  We got... We're on the march.
[01:30:00.076 --> 01:30:00.736]  Rappaport's coming up.
[01:30:00.756 --> 01:30:01.477]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:01.517 --> 01:30:02.117]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:02.177 --> 01:30:02.537]  Stay with us.
[01:30:02.857 --> 01:30:05.539]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.815 --> 01:30:13.798]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:30:13.838 --> 01:30:17.961]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:30:18.221 --> 01:30:21.644]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:30:21.864 --> 01:30:24.766]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:30:24.926 --> 01:30:32.232]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins of heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:30:32.492 --> 01:30:36.133]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:30:36.393 --> 01:30:40.635]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:30:40.815 --> 01:30:46.736]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:30:46.776 --> 01:30:50.558]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:30:50.718 --> 01:30:53.259]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:30:53.459 --> 01:30:54.819]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:30:54.959 --> 01:30:56.179]  It's time to take action.
[01:30:56.339 --> 01:30:57.980]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:31:08.893 --> 01:31:12.457]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:31:12.717 --> 01:31:15.941]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots.
[01:31:16.101 --> 01:31:17.523]  Over at My Patriot Supply.
[01:31:34.423 --> 01:31:40.148]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:31:40.388 --> 01:31:43.171]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:31:43.551 --> 01:31:48.776]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:31:48.936 --> 01:31:56.963]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[01:32:01.388 --> 01:32:03.453]  That's 866-229-0927.

[01:32:06.279 --> 01:32:08.945]  BuyPatriotsupply.com slash Alex.
[01:32:10.985 --> 01:32:12.025]  In the near future.
[01:32:12.306 --> 01:32:16.447]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:32:16.807 --> 01:32:17.807]  Security alert.
[01:32:18.027 --> 01:32:19.768]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:32:20.028 --> 01:32:20.648]  Analysis.
[01:32:20.908 --> 01:32:21.569]  InfoWars.
[01:32:21.629 --> 01:32:23.589]  Building independent media operations.
[01:32:23.609 --> 01:32:28.571]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:32:28.611 --> 01:32:29.591]  Crime Directive.
[01:32:29.652 --> 01:32:31.112]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:32:31.192 --> 01:32:33.973]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:32:34.053 --> 01:32:37.114]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:32:37.294 --> 01:32:39.455]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:32:39.775 --> 01:32:41.095]  People are assaulting us.
[01:32:41.115 --> 01:32:43.416]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:32:43.936 --> 01:32:45.617]  They are never going to stop.
[01:32:45.897 --> 01:32:49.778]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:32:49.938 --> 01:32:53.099]  Block free iPhone app at InfoWars.com.
[01:32:53.519 --> 01:32:56.180]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[01:32:56.900 --> 01:32:57.620]  Imperative.
[01:32:57.880 --> 01:32:59.881]  Destroy Little Minute TV.
[01:32:59.901 --> 01:33:04.322]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:33:04.422 --> 01:33:05.943]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[01:33:05.963 --> 01:33:06.723]  You can feel it.
[01:33:20.054 --> 01:33:23.375]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:24.116 --> 01:33:26.277]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:32.980]  All right.
[01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:37.442]  You know, sometimes we don't have him on for four or five months, and then we'll have him on three times in one week.
[01:33:38.322 --> 01:33:42.324]  But I want to make him a bigger part of the nightly news, and also the whole operation.
[01:33:42.844 --> 01:33:46.766]  And he's John Rappaport, best-selling author, researcher, political analyst.
[01:33:47.648 --> 01:33:49.212]  Investigative journalist in so many other hats.
[01:33:49.232 --> 01:33:52.660]  He's coming up in just one moment to cover the waterfront of issues.
[01:33:53.381 --> 01:33:55.767]  And I know that we have Sean in Wyoming worked with
[01:33:57.833 --> 01:34:02.176]  Worked on issues concerning the question I had dealing with Bergdahl.
[01:34:02.736 --> 01:34:06.599]  We've got Brandon in Texas who's active army who's been holding as well.
[01:34:06.679 --> 01:34:11.522]  So we'll finish up with Bergdahl first with Rappaport and get his take on that.
[01:34:11.962 --> 01:34:13.684]  He's always up on the news as a newshound.
[01:34:14.004 --> 01:34:25.532]  Let those callers that have been holding for 30 minutes get off the line, Brandon and then Sean, and then move forward into all these other issues with the host of nomorefakenews.com, John Rappaport.
[01:34:26.092 --> 01:34:27.493]  Before we go any further,
[01:34:28.894 --> 01:34:32.415]  We are going to sell out of the Super Female Vitality.
[01:34:32.535 --> 01:34:39.839]  All it is is 10 well-known herbs that are organic and concentrated in a live, cold-pressed, tincture form.
[01:34:40.796 --> 01:34:47.821]  And that's why everyone I talk to, I mean almost everyone, I know one person, it's now like ten women I know that have taken it.
[01:34:48.601 --> 01:34:52.564]  One person said it made them tired at first and that's because they think they had a hormone imbalance or something.
[01:34:52.884 --> 01:34:54.185]  So it can affect people differently.
[01:34:54.825 --> 01:34:57.607]  Have said it makes them bounce off the walls with energy, libido, you name it.
[01:34:58.208 --> 01:35:02.691]  They had already at the laboratory run less than a thousand extra for our next order.
[01:35:04.011 --> 01:35:06.012]  So we can get those so we're not backward.
[01:35:06.052 --> 01:35:07.152]  Those are coming in a few days.
[01:35:07.652 --> 01:35:11.053]  But when those are gone, it could be three weeks, it could be a month and a half.
[01:35:11.694 --> 01:35:16.675]  Because we're waiting on two of the herbs that are raw to be cold-pressed.
[01:35:16.735 --> 01:35:20.016]  And you've got to get them certified organic and all the rest of it.
[01:35:20.056 --> 01:35:21.317]  We're very neurotic about that.
[01:35:21.337 --> 01:35:23.137]  Because we want to bring you the very best quality.
[01:35:23.157 --> 01:35:24.158]  I mean, it cost us $15 to $20 a bottle.
[01:35:26.198 --> 01:35:30.342]  Other people have similar stuff, it's like $2 a bottle, and they sell it for $100 instead of $50 like we do.
[01:35:30.942 --> 01:35:38.849]  And this is how we fund our operation, bringing you the Super Male Vitality, which we have plenty of, the Super Female Vitality, and the X2 Iodine.
[01:35:39.810 --> 01:35:47.337]  Now, again, we came out a year ago with the first survival shield, we still have that in stock, and have discounted it, and it's great.
[01:35:49.399 --> 01:35:52.322]  It turns blue on paper, all the other iodines turn black.
[01:35:53.459 --> 01:35:56.520]  And that's because we believe they're bound with the alcohol or something, but you still need it.
[01:35:56.540 --> 01:35:57.120]  You still need iodine.
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:59.581]  The problem is it's not palatable for kids and things like that.
[01:36:00.461 --> 01:36:05.903]  He came out with the X2 that is from deep iodine crystals that are purple.
[01:36:06.784 --> 01:36:08.844]  That's why it's important on paper, folks, it turns purple.
[01:36:09.204 --> 01:36:10.845]  The other iodines don't turn purple, you'll notice.
[01:36:11.425 --> 01:36:19.708]  That's because this is real pure iodine, and that's why Dr. Group believes it goes into the blood and just has this big effect because it just goes right into you.
[01:36:20.508 --> 01:36:22.429]  Now, consult your physician before you take it.
[01:36:23.406 --> 01:36:27.548]  And, or your health care provider, and I would go slow on that, but that's my advice.
[01:36:27.568 --> 01:36:38.711]  You know, this is all, I mean, even the government admits you need iodine, they used to put it in the salt, and they don't now, and instead they put stuff in the food chain that's the opposite of it, the bromines, the bromides that block iodine.
[01:36:38.772 --> 01:36:47.034]  But for me, this has just been life-changing, and we love to promote and sell things that are excellent, that help fund the operation and the hardcore free speech we have.
[01:36:47.415 --> 01:36:50.796]  So, bare minimum, try it out for yourself if you're talking to your health care provider.
[01:36:51.696 --> 01:36:53.798]  And reading all the, you know, disclaimers and things.
[01:36:54.379 --> 01:36:57.022]  I mean, hell, they can make you have disclaimers for vitamin C now, folks.
[01:36:57.062 --> 01:36:57.643]  So just whatever.
[01:36:57.663 --> 01:36:58.523]  Look into it for yourself.
[01:36:59.304 --> 01:37:01.987]  And bare minimum, you've helped the broadcast.
[01:37:02.828 --> 01:37:06.212]  Bare minimum, you have funded hardcore free speech.
[01:37:06.572 --> 01:37:08.114]  And I want to thank all of you that have gotten the products.
[01:37:08.134 --> 01:37:08.975]  You've heard the rave reviews.
[01:37:10.576 --> 01:37:15.478]  I believe, like we've seen in almost all other cases, you will love it and be blown away by it and become a regular user of it.
[01:37:16.018 --> 01:37:21.040]  So, we have the X2 Survival Shield now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:22.620]  That's one word, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:23.741]  Or call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[01:37:27.242 --> 01:37:43.926]  We also have on InfoWarsStore.com all the ProGun t-shirts, all the Liberty Base t-shirts, the Don't Tread on Me, the ball caps, the hunting hats, the camo hats, the Made in America bronze, George Washington 1776 belt buckles, all of it limited edition at Madein1776.com.
[01:37:44.326 --> 01:37:52.668]  That'll just take you to the subpage that has the Made in America stuff at InfoWarsStore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:37:53.048 --> 01:37:55.129]  And we couldn't do any of this without your support.
[01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:56.269]  We don't have George Soros.
[01:37:57.554 --> 01:38:00.016]  Like the globalists have to fund 5 billion to overthrow Ukraine.
[01:38:00.936 --> 01:38:06.720]  We don't have billions of stimulus money like NPR and MSNBC get in taxpayer money.
[01:38:07.221 --> 01:38:12.484]  We are literally sink or swim, free market, free will, free association, you decide to support us.
[01:38:13.064 --> 01:38:14.025]  And that's the only way I'd have it.
[01:38:14.405 --> 01:38:18.708]  And they haven't wrecked the country and the world to an extent yet to where we can't get the funding.
[01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:19.669]  So thank you.
[01:38:19.969 --> 01:38:23.612]  If the funding continues to come in, sometimes it's lean, sometimes it's fat,
[01:38:24.554 --> 01:38:29.579]  We take the fat, we put it into the operation to get more reporters, more people trained to do more.
[01:38:30.139 --> 01:38:31.140]  And that's what we're doing now.
[01:38:31.401 --> 01:38:38.588]  From Bilderberg, to the FEMA camps in Virginia, to the radiation on the West Coast, to just reporters everywhere.
[01:38:39.068 --> 01:38:45.875]  Our great reporters like Jakari Jackson, Leanne McAdoo, Darren McBreen, Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs,
[01:38:47.236 --> 01:38:51.160]  You know, just all the great reporters, like John Bowne, there are so many others.
[01:38:51.220 --> 01:38:54.643]  Paul Watson, Steve Watson, Kurt Nemo, just all of them.
[01:38:55.083 --> 01:38:56.784]  And the video editors and the whole team.
[01:38:57.765 --> 01:39:03.570]  It's now over 50 people total and you have customer service, shipping, reporters, writers, crew running the shows.
[01:39:03.770 --> 01:39:06.052]  Everyone is just as important as everybody else.
[01:39:06.072 --> 01:39:10.316]  Because let's face it, I'm the first person to not be a narcissist on a power trip.
[01:39:10.516 --> 01:39:14.540]  I get very excited about the people we've reached and what we've been able to do with passion and the truth.
[01:39:15.441 --> 01:39:16.921]  But different strokes for different folks.
[01:39:19.402 --> 01:39:20.502]  I come off as obnoxious.
[01:39:20.582 --> 01:39:21.863]  I come off as aggressive.
[01:39:21.903 --> 01:39:25.343]  I come off as bombastic, as interrupting on many fronts.
[01:39:26.644 --> 01:39:29.645]  Some people don't like me, but they'll like our other reporters.
[01:39:29.745 --> 01:39:31.025]  They'll like Leanne McAdoo.
[01:39:31.745 --> 01:39:35.046]  They'll like a Rob Dew and their perspective on the world.
[01:39:35.874 --> 01:39:37.915]  And our yardstick is, do you love liberty?
[01:39:37.955 --> 01:39:38.855]  Do you want the truth?
[01:39:39.135 --> 01:39:40.216]  Do you care about history?
[01:39:40.476 --> 01:39:41.376]  Do you care about freedom?
[01:39:41.436 --> 01:39:42.777]  That's the kind of reporters we want.
[01:39:43.157 --> 01:39:45.838]  Some of them have journalism degrees from the University of Texas, like Leanne.
[01:39:46.238 --> 01:39:50.839]  Others have worked for, you know, McClatchy and, uh, Scripps Howard, like McBreen.
[01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:57.042]  Others have worked for, you know, uh, production for semiconductor companies, like Rob Dew.
[01:39:58.082 --> 01:40:00.145]  Others have no formal training like yours truly.
[01:40:00.805 --> 01:40:02.968]  We all just bring truth and justice to the table.
[01:40:03.989 --> 01:40:05.591]  And we're very excited to have the whole team here.
[01:40:05.611 --> 01:40:12.098]  I want to take some time out to thank all of you for supporting the operation so we could build this one-of-a-kind operation.
[01:40:12.118 --> 01:40:17.744]  I want to thank God, number one, for the providence of taking a sinner and a weak creature like myself
[01:40:18.345 --> 01:40:23.989]  And the fact that I just turned my will over to liberty and was given something even greater than free will.
[01:40:24.069 --> 01:40:27.451]  I still have free will, but it's free will with a drive towards justice.
[01:40:28.132 --> 01:40:29.213]  And so I am so humble.
[01:40:29.853 --> 01:40:31.754]  And I'm living the American dream of liberty.
[01:40:32.054 --> 01:40:34.656]  There's great evil happening, but that's what animates us.
[01:40:34.716 --> 01:40:37.258]  That's the opposing force that tests our mettle.
[01:40:37.698 --> 01:40:39.840]  And so I am humble before my creator.
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:45.984]  And humble before other great lovers of liberty like John Rappaport and so many others that we have on this broadcast.
[01:40:46.284 --> 01:40:50.066]  John, I want to go to a few calls from Brandon and Sean and then give you the floor.
[01:40:50.106 --> 01:40:55.650]  In fact, I may even let you just take over the last 30 minutes to really get into whatever you want and may just step away.
[01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:56.891]  Not even because of time.
[01:40:57.191 --> 01:40:59.973]  Wild horses couldn't drag me away, but I'm getting you primed.
[01:41:00.613 --> 01:41:12.240]  Uh, to maybe even send you some better equipment and have you host the show sometimes, uh, just like the great, uh, David Knight does, who's out of the country with Josh Owens coming back from Bilderberg today in Copenhagen.
[01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:17.863]  Uh, but give us your brief take, uh, on, I mean, not too brief on the Bo Bergdahl story.
[01:41:17.943 --> 01:41:19.524]  Why it doesn't, it doesn't smell good to me.
[01:41:19.544 --> 01:41:21.585]  I want to see if it doesn't smell good to you.
[01:41:21.965 --> 01:41:24.387]  And then we're going to go to Brandon and Sean and then move on to other issues.
[01:41:25.629 --> 01:41:26.309]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:41:26.489 --> 01:41:27.069]  Absolutely.
[01:41:27.750 --> 01:41:29.730]  Well, I would say three things quickly.
[01:41:29.970 --> 01:41:37.393]  One is, an operation like this to bring back this guy is aimed at demoralizing U.S.
[01:41:37.433 --> 01:41:37.893]  soldiers.
[01:41:38.993 --> 01:41:41.094]  The entire, you know, rank and file.
[01:41:42.429 --> 01:41:43.350]  That's number one.
[01:41:43.811 --> 01:41:50.018]  That's exactly how do you give focus to a traitor and someone who went and joined other people and then hold that up.
[01:41:50.478 --> 01:41:52.000]  It's meant to make us all feel bad.
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:53.522]  See, I hadn't gone with that angle.
[01:41:53.822 --> 01:41:54.223]  You hit it.
[01:41:54.263 --> 01:41:54.603]  Go ahead.
[01:41:54.923 --> 01:41:55.544]  Expand on that.
[01:41:55.965 --> 01:41:56.225]  Right.
[01:41:56.485 --> 01:41:58.027]  I mean, that's the idea.
[01:41:58.087 --> 01:41:59.228]  The guy is a wall.
[01:41:59.248 --> 01:42:00.350]  He deserves whatever.
[01:42:01.151 --> 01:42:02.272]  And all of a sudden,
[01:42:02.850 --> 01:42:09.756]  This tremendous deal is made to return these Taliban chiefs in return, you know, for this guy.
[01:42:09.936 --> 01:42:11.637]  And so what do the soldiers start thinking?
[01:42:11.657 --> 01:42:13.939]  Well, what are we doing over here in Afghanistan?
[01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:29.812]  You know, we're dying, we're getting wounded, we're serving multiple tours to capture and kill these Taliban people, and all of a sudden, a few of the major ones are free, and this guy who walked away, a U.S.
[01:42:29.852 --> 01:42:32.314]  soldier, he's returned to the United States.
[01:42:33.231 --> 01:42:41.106]  So that immediately puts a total cold blanket on the whole rank and file of the U.S.
[01:42:41.166 --> 01:42:41.387]  Army.
[01:42:42.026 --> 01:42:55.859]  And then number two, of course, it distracts everybody from the enormous VA scandal, the enormous and growing VA scandal that we haven't even begun to scratch the surface on, believe me.
[01:42:56.159 --> 01:43:04.327]  I mean, as huge as the implications are so far, that's nothing to compare to what's going to be dug up on this by people that are really looking.
[01:43:04.387 --> 01:43:05.267]  So this
[01:43:05.988 --> 01:43:07.690]  Yes, this is speculation, but who knows?
[01:43:22.723 --> 01:43:24.545]  Maybe this guy, this U.S.
[01:43:24.605 --> 01:43:31.452]  soldier that was just returned, suppose, for example, he was actually getting ready to talk in public.
[01:43:32.092 --> 01:43:33.914]  Not because somebody had brainwashed him.
[01:43:34.174 --> 01:43:34.615]  Who knows?
[01:43:34.835 --> 01:43:36.457]  I don't know who this guy actually is.
[01:43:36.817 --> 01:43:42.202]  But just suppose that he wants to go public and talk about what's happened in the war over there.
[01:43:43.503 --> 01:43:44.164]  And the U.S.
[01:43:44.204 --> 01:43:46.026]  intelligence community got wind of it.
[01:43:47.389 --> 01:43:49.210]  Wouldn't that be incredible?
[01:43:49.330 --> 01:43:53.972]  And they say to the Akani Network, you grab him, you give him back, we'll give you who you want.
[01:43:54.252 --> 01:43:55.933]  Now they have him locked down in a hospital.
[01:43:56.433 --> 01:43:56.933]  Exactly.
[01:43:57.233 --> 01:43:58.414]  And never to be seen again.
[01:43:59.314 --> 01:43:59.594]  Boom.
[01:44:00.035 --> 01:44:00.655]  End of story.
[01:44:03.216 --> 01:44:04.076]  Could very well be.
[01:44:04.217 --> 01:44:05.417]  I think we've hit all the angles.
[01:44:05.517 --> 01:44:06.778]  I think we've hit all the angles on that.
[01:44:06.798 --> 01:44:08.939]  Let's take a call from Brandon and then Sean.
[01:44:08.979 --> 01:44:10.579]  Brandon is Active Army.
[01:44:10.779 --> 01:44:11.460]  Thank you for holding.
[01:44:11.780 --> 01:44:13.341]  Brandon, what's your take on this whole thing?
[01:44:14.141 --> 01:44:16.182]  Yeah, I think we need to go back to the
[01:44:16.843 --> 01:44:23.764]  The difference in stories between whether or not this guy walked off the FOB or whether or not he fell behind on a patrol.
[01:44:24.865 --> 01:44:31.846]  If he walked off that FOB, the soldiers around him would have, say he just dropped all his gear and his weapon.
[01:44:32.926 --> 01:44:37.207]  His platoon sergeant would have had to check that back in, his TA-50 and his weapon.
[01:44:37.687 --> 01:44:41.748]  Now, I think that we have to look at that first.
[01:44:42.529 --> 01:44:43.789]  I mean, there's a paper trail there.
[01:44:43.829 --> 01:44:44.970]  There's always a paper trail.
[01:44:45.210 --> 01:44:52.791]  So you're saying the hobbits, the hobbits at the base, as they're called, would have actually checked all that and had a record.
[01:44:52.951 --> 01:44:57.872]  Well, that's what CNN is saying, is that, oh my gosh, people at the base are saying he walked off.
[01:44:58.673 --> 01:44:59.433]  But there'd be proof.
[01:45:01.013 --> 01:45:01.273]  Right.
[01:45:02.273 --> 01:45:06.834]  So, another thing, I don't see how he could have possibly fell behind on a patrol.
[01:45:06.914 --> 01:45:09.615]  Any squad leader worth his salt is never going to let
[01:45:10.336 --> 01:45:11.137]  Anybody outside.
[01:45:11.177 --> 01:45:13.579]  I mean, accountability is a huge thing in the military.
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:15.841]  I'm just not buying it.
[01:45:17.622 --> 01:45:19.243]  I think it's more likely... We'll continue.
[01:45:19.283 --> 01:45:21.185]  I was interrupting you.
[01:45:22.005 --> 01:45:25.488]  Going back to this forward base and describing how security works on those.
[01:45:27.550 --> 01:45:37.298]  Well, there's... The only way he could have walked off that FOB was if he was on an ECP, which is the entry control point.
[01:45:37.918 --> 01:45:39.900]  There would have been several people seeing him do it.
[01:45:41.068 --> 01:45:48.954]  Um, yeah, they could have been told to lie or whatever about it, but most time they don't cover all their bases.
[01:45:48.974 --> 01:45:50.194]  There's going to be a paper trail.
[01:45:50.274 --> 01:46:00.962]  And if he was, if he fell behind on a patrol and got picked up out in the middle of nowhere, then his weapon and TA-50 would be missing, which TA-50 is what, you know, your gear you carry.
[01:46:02.002 --> 01:46:06.686]  So that's, I'm hearing two different stories on that.
[01:46:06.766 --> 01:46:07.206]  And I think,
[01:46:07.811 --> 01:46:12.515]  If we get to the bottom of that, we'll find out a lot more about what this guy really is.
[01:46:12.615 --> 01:46:14.837]  Personally, I think he was a traitor to begin with.
[01:46:18.421 --> 01:46:19.882]  What do other people around you think?
[01:46:21.804 --> 01:46:22.464]  Same thing.
[01:46:22.584 --> 01:46:25.287]  That's the conclusion that we've pretty much all come to.
[01:46:25.307 --> 01:46:34.135]  I don't know anybody that knows him personally, but it's just not, it's not passing the smell test with any of us.
[01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:43.365]  Why would Obama then do this and release five of these really bad guys and then at the same time build this guy up like a hero?
[01:46:43.405 --> 01:46:46.207]  I mean, doesn't Obama know that'll blow up in his face?
[01:46:46.227 --> 01:46:46.888]  He just doesn't care.
[01:46:48.009 --> 01:46:48.769]  I don't think he cares.
[01:46:48.829 --> 01:46:50.350]  I think he's just helping his buddies out.
[01:46:51.431 --> 01:46:51.831]  That's it.
[01:46:51.891 --> 01:46:52.392]  Bottom line.
[01:46:56.895 --> 01:46:57.495]  Very interesting.
[01:46:57.515 --> 01:46:58.416]  I appreciate your call.
[01:46:58.736 --> 01:46:59.937]  Let's talk to Sean in Wyoming.
[01:46:59.957 --> 01:47:00.898]  Sean, go ahead.
[01:47:00.918 --> 01:47:01.298]  You're on the air.
[01:47:01.991 --> 01:47:02.752]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:47:02.772 --> 01:47:03.853]  I haven't talked to you in a while.
[01:47:04.073 --> 01:47:09.337]  I'm the fellow who worked with the Reagan National Advance Team for the campaign in Haiti with the Secret Service and so forth.
[01:47:09.678 --> 01:47:14.502]  And I've been up here in Wyoming for 36 years and I want to throw some more food for thought.
[01:47:14.522 --> 01:47:22.869]  I think you basically, we've got all the pieces of, there's been some tremendous points and they all have validity.
[01:47:23.529 --> 01:47:28.534]  But what I, you know, I've been up in Wyoming for 36 years and I know the people
[01:47:29.466 --> 01:47:33.987]  And the different political factions in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho like the back of my hand.
[01:47:34.007 --> 01:47:44.511]  And what struck me most telling is the fact when they wheeled these folks out with Obama the other day and then when they flew back into Boise and they had that press conference.
[01:47:45.211 --> 01:47:48.832]  There's all kinds of different factions in Idaho as you might know.
[01:47:49.432 --> 01:47:54.094]  There's constitutionalists and white supremacists and Nazis and former government people.
[01:47:54.574 --> 01:47:55.754]  And it's a whole plethora.
[01:47:56.314 --> 01:47:58.495]  It's unlike anything in Montana or Wyoming.
[01:47:59.179 --> 01:48:06.462]  And what you have here is basically, by the way of the appearance of the boy's father, a nonconformist.
[01:48:06.502 --> 01:48:08.743]  And he can be a nonconformist on the left or right.
[01:48:09.183 --> 01:48:13.725]  He certainly, to me, came across as a little bit in the hippie deal.
[01:48:13.825 --> 01:48:15.565]  And they're naturalists.
[01:48:15.665 --> 01:48:20.247]  If you look at her... So you're saying he was kind of an odd duck, a hippie odd duck?
[01:48:20.427 --> 01:48:25.210]  Well, he was typical of anybody who knows the social climate of Idaho.
[01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:28.612]  Central Idaho and Northern Idaho where all these different people gather.
[01:48:29.233 --> 01:48:34.817]  And this very guy, you know, it could be Pchenik may have something, this guy may have walked away.
[01:48:34.837 --> 01:48:36.418]  He might have been another Brad Tillman.
[01:48:36.438 --> 01:48:46.384]  He went over there and had some moral objections on what we were doing, walked over to the other side, and he had come from a family
[01:48:48.252 --> 01:48:53.315]  Uh, that, let's say, were progressives and thought outside the box.
[01:48:53.435 --> 01:49:03.281]  And that's what the old man was trying to communicate with him the other day, how proud he was that he held to his moral convictions.
[01:49:03.341 --> 01:49:05.362]  But it doesn't smell right.
[01:49:05.902 --> 01:49:10.005]  It's just part of a continual psyop, whether it's in Santa Barbara.
[01:49:10.605 --> 01:49:19.107]  Or a new town, or this deal, and it's obviously, the first thing that hit me was the fact that it's a major distraction from the VA.
[01:49:19.147 --> 01:49:31.610]  We've got our own problems here in Wyoming, down at the base in Cheyenne, Fort Warren, and then the fact that they came from Idaho.
[01:49:31.630 --> 01:49:37.572]  It's just very interesting, and it's just another PSYOP as far as I'm concerned.
[01:49:38.388 --> 01:49:39.409]  All right, very interesting point.
[01:49:39.429 --> 01:49:47.733]  We're going to take one more call after break, or right now, and then come back from break with John Rappaport of nomorefakenews.com, who's riding shotgun with me here today.
[01:49:49.553 --> 01:49:58.098]  Pat Tillman didn't like them growing opium and guarding it, and didn't like the fact they were doing photo ops, and were working with some of the Al-Qaeda, Taliban, but not the others.
[01:49:58.898 --> 01:50:02.720]  And now all that's come out, so I don't want to put him in the same area as this guy.
[01:50:03.460 --> 01:50:09.525]  Uh, Pat Tillman was an amazing guy, making five million dollars a year, turned it all loose, because he thought America was under attack.
[01:50:10.426 --> 01:50:12.888]  Uh, and then he went over there and found it was a bigger fraud and got upset.
[01:50:13.268 --> 01:50:14.769]  Totally different person than this guy.
[01:50:15.430 --> 01:50:19.373]  Uh, let's talk to, um, Max in Idaho real quick.
[01:50:19.413 --> 01:50:21.715]  Says mother-in-law is friends with family, knows parents.
[01:50:22.135 --> 01:50:23.756]  Max, what's your take on all this, briefly?
[01:50:25.498 --> 01:50:27.779]  Uh, this isn't Max, this is his mother-in-law.
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:29.541]  Okay, just says Max.
[01:50:29.921 --> 01:50:30.602]  Okay, fine, go ahead.
[01:50:30.622 --> 01:50:32.163]  And I know, I know both parents.
[01:50:33.697 --> 01:50:35.058]  Okay, so what's your take on this then?
[01:50:36.399 --> 01:50:37.460]  You know, I really don't know.
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:40.422]  I know that they're wonderful people.
[01:50:40.442 --> 01:50:56.833]  I believe that Bo's father grew a beard and began to speak Arabic right after Bo was captured because he, I think there was nothing more than just he wanted to support his father.
[01:50:56.853 --> 01:50:58.094]  So he was doing it through solidarity.
[01:50:58.134 --> 01:50:58.735]  Stay there, ma'am.
[01:50:58.775 --> 01:50:59.355]  Don't hang up.
[01:50:59.555 --> 01:51:00.456]  What's your name, ma'am?
[01:51:02.300 --> 01:51:03.962]  Okay, Susan, stay there.
[01:51:04.262 --> 01:51:06.404]  And then we're going to get right, we're going to ask you a question as well.
[01:51:06.765 --> 01:51:07.786]  And then that's it.
[01:51:07.846 --> 01:51:10.168]  I got to stop taking calls.

[01:53:53.278 --> 01:53:55.219]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.
[01:53:55.460 --> 01:53:59.982]  Is it time to convert paper 401ks and IRAs to solid gold and silver yet?
[01:54:00.162 --> 01:54:01.723]  Get our 10 Reasons book free.
[01:54:01.923 --> 01:54:02.184]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:54:02.204 --> 01:54:02.404]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:54:43.496 --> 01:54:47.017]  By the way, I haven't gotten to any of the aftermath of Bilderberg 2014.
[01:54:47.057 --> 01:54:48.298]  A lot of important intel.
[01:54:48.778 --> 01:54:51.419]  I was on Coast to Coast AM last night, breaking some of that down.
[01:54:51.799 --> 01:54:54.220]  John Rappaport, I said, what do you want to get into today?
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:55.461]  Some wildcard issue.
[01:54:55.481 --> 01:55:03.424]  And he goes, free energy or other forms of alternative energy that are being suppressed while they prepare to cut off our old forms of energy.
[01:55:04.424 --> 01:55:06.166]  And he's really got a lot of intel on that.
[01:55:06.186 --> 01:55:09.649]  We're going to spend a lot of the next hour on that subject.
[01:55:10.009 --> 01:55:17.095]  If you go up to DrudgeReport.com, it's now scrolled down to the bottom right-hand side, you can find an article that we put out last night.
[01:55:17.815 --> 01:55:24.161]  And it says, in the U.S., four major news networks, zero Bilderberg 2014 coverage.
[01:55:24.701 --> 01:55:26.343]  Only some CNBC coverage.
[01:55:27.679 --> 01:55:28.439]  Drudge covered it.
[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:30.220]  InfoWars covered it.
[01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:31.380]  WorldNetDaily covered it.
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:33.761]  A whole bunch of European newspapers covered it.
[01:55:34.541 --> 01:55:37.202]  But no news in the U.S.
[01:55:38.243 --> 01:55:39.503]  other than one cable network.
[01:55:40.043 --> 01:55:42.644]  And that's because people want to know about business, so it was business news.
[01:55:43.845 --> 01:55:49.587]  And it's just incredible that not even Fox News would cover this.
[01:55:51.627 --> 01:55:52.127]  Last year
[01:55:54.048 --> 01:55:58.233]  Napolitano did cover it when he was filling in on one of the shows on Fox Business.
[01:55:59.595 --> 01:56:02.298]  So, again, that's why they're becoming obsolete.
[01:56:03.660 --> 01:56:10.989]  It's because they won't talk about world leaders meeting in secret, when the world leaders brag in their own minutes and told German news that they're more powerful than Davos.
[01:56:11.912 --> 01:56:13.633]  So I'm going to get Rappaport's take on that.
[01:56:14.213 --> 01:56:16.414]  John Rappaport coming up, riding shotgun with us.
[01:56:17.035 --> 01:56:20.356]  Briefly here, going back to Susan, says she knows the family.
[01:56:20.957 --> 01:56:28.340]  Any other points you'd like to make on this whole situation with the so-called, you know, prisoner of war release, Bo Bergdahl.
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:28.721]  Go ahead.
[01:56:30.221 --> 01:56:33.303]  Well, my take on it, I've known the kid since he was a little boy.
[01:56:33.323 --> 01:56:35.364]  I've known Bob and Jamie forever.
[01:56:36.545 --> 01:56:38.906]  My daughter went to school with Bo.
[01:56:39.546 --> 01:56:40.867]  He was just nothing more than a
[01:56:41.596 --> 01:56:47.561]  And I think that he just wandered off because I think he got over there and he was scared.
[01:56:48.041 --> 01:56:48.902]  He didn't want to be there.
[01:56:48.922 --> 01:56:51.344]  I think it was very innocent.
[01:56:52.345 --> 01:57:05.275]  I think he was brainwashed as far as I'm concerned because if you knew the valley that we were all raised in, it's a very simple valley and there's nothing to be scared of to be raised there.
[01:57:05.735 --> 01:57:08.818]  You're just raised and the boys either go off to service or they go to college.
[01:57:10.635 --> 01:57:18.080]  And Bo decided to go to the service and he got caught up in something that he wasn't prepared for.
[01:57:18.820 --> 01:57:21.182]  And I think it's nothing more or nothing less than that.
[01:57:22.290 --> 01:57:36.419]  Ma'am, I'd like to put you on hold, and I believe you who you say you are, but check that as a journalist to make sure it's on record, and have you on the nightly news tonight to talk about the family, to talk about the town, and to reach out to the family.
[01:57:36.439 --> 01:57:45.145]  Because I'm saying, he could have been a deep cover agent, could be a hero infiltrating, could be what Pchenik says, you know, deserting, and, you know, off the reservation.
[01:57:45.425 --> 01:57:46.926]  Could have been grabbed, we don't know.
[01:57:47.327 --> 01:57:51.930]  It's just, I don't believe anything comes out of Obama's mouth, and I don't know why they bring all this out now.
[01:57:53.512 --> 01:57:54.953]  It's a very sophisticated question.
[01:57:55.014 --> 01:57:56.035]  I'd like to get the truth out.
[01:57:56.535 --> 01:57:58.918]  So if you can reach out to the family for us, I'd appreciate that.
[01:57:58.938 --> 01:58:08.951]  But I'm going to put you on hold, and if you do that, I'd like to get your name and number, and see if we can have you, you know, go public and document you are who you say you are, so that we can get you to come on the Nightly News tonight, okay?
[01:58:08.971 --> 01:58:10.253]  Thank you so much.
[01:58:10.313 --> 01:58:11.034]  Please don't hang up.
[01:58:13.206 --> 01:58:13.927]  So there you go, folks.
[01:58:13.947 --> 01:58:15.348]  We're just seeking the truth on this.
[01:58:15.828 --> 01:58:19.512]  With all the fake stuff we've seen put out, it's just something isn't adding up.
[01:58:19.872 --> 01:58:23.676]  In closing on that subject, what do you make of what she just said, John Rappaport?
[01:58:26.260 --> 01:58:26.961]  You bet!
[01:58:44.919 --> 01:58:47.842]  It's quite different than anybody thinks it is.
[01:58:47.862 --> 01:58:48.883]  Let's come right back in 60 seconds.
[01:58:59.577 --> 01:59:02.420]  This is Leanne McAdoo for InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:02.701 --> 01:59:08.607]  I'm here with Dr. Edward Group, Master Herbologist and Chief Formulator behind the InfoWarsLife products.
[01:59:08.807 --> 01:59:13.232]  Dr. Group, what have you been hearing from women who've started taking Super Female Vitality?
[01:59:13.312 --> 01:59:19.880]  You know, we've heard the reviews and feedback from Super Male Vitality from emails to even excited callers on the radio.
[01:59:20.180 --> 01:59:22.061]  Now, the answer for women is here.
[01:59:22.201 --> 01:59:33.745]  A new formulation specifically designed for the female body, Super Female Vitality, delivers 10 key herbs that work synergistically to revitalize the unique biology of women.
[01:59:33.865 --> 01:59:35.846]  I'm so glad that you guys made this for women.
[01:59:35.886 --> 01:59:41.428]  When he brought me home, the bottle of Super Female had tons of energy, tons of motivation, a lot of drive.
[01:59:41.448 --> 01:59:42.789]  My husband thinks I've been in a better mood.
[01:59:42.809 --> 01:59:45.350]  Our relationship, all I can say is this is a lot better now.
[01:59:45.590 --> 01:59:49.734]  I've just started taking Super Female Vitality from InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:49.934 --> 01:59:56.280]  Supplies are limited, so secure yours today at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or dial 1-888-253-3139.
[02:00:14.485 --> 02:00:18.648]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:19.308 --> 02:00:20.109]  You want answers?
[02:00:20.889 --> 02:00:21.790]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:22.450 --> 02:00:26.053]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:26.633 --> 02:00:30.676]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:41.765 --> 02:00:45.369]  You know it really shows how controlled the networks are in this country.
[02:00:45.389 --> 02:00:53.979]  That's what targets the mainline public that doesn't know their hands from their butt in many cases because of the upbringing of the media brainwashing system.
[02:00:54.920 --> 02:00:58.323]  We've got John Rappaport on the line with this investigative journalist.
[02:00:58.724 --> 02:00:59.444]  No more fake news.
[02:00:59.825 --> 02:01:00.886]  This is a short segment.
[02:01:01.246 --> 02:01:03.329]  Bunch of long segments coming up and I want him to really
[02:01:03.869 --> 02:01:09.712]  Be able to get into the conspiracy to shut off our old industry while blocking new energy, while acting like they're for the new energy.
[02:01:09.732 --> 02:01:13.073]  So I'm going to give him the floor from 24 after to the end.
[02:01:13.093 --> 02:01:16.134]  That's about 30 minutes of airtime with Jon Rappaport.
[02:01:16.535 --> 02:01:17.435]  I don't even have to go anywhere.
[02:01:17.455 --> 02:01:19.016]  I just want to turn the show over to him and listen.
[02:01:19.756 --> 02:01:21.397]  So that's coming up with Jon Rappaport.
[02:01:22.217 --> 02:01:29.519]  Today, and I'll be back tomorrow with the show with Paul Watson, David Knight, and a bunch of other people, a bunch of big guests coming up this week.
[02:01:29.980 --> 02:01:32.680]  But you were getting into the real reality of Afghanistan.
[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:40.703]  I've got my breakdown reality of what it's really like, just a big hole to dump money into, a full-spectrum dominance, globalist system.
[02:01:41.423 --> 02:01:47.265]  Break down your take on Afghanistan, and we'll go to break, come back, mention Bilderberg, a few other issues, and then get into free energy.
[02:01:48.607 --> 02:01:49.468]  No question about it.
[02:01:49.548 --> 02:01:52.770]  It's, as you say, a full spectrum dominance operation.
[02:01:53.391 --> 02:01:55.072]  It's also drugs.
[02:01:55.192 --> 02:01:58.335]  It's also, you know, a rise in the poppies.
[02:01:58.755 --> 02:02:02.458]  Lots more poppies growing since we went over there.
[02:02:02.838 --> 02:02:04.580]  The opium is flowing.
[02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:06.861]  The opium has to be kept flowing.
[02:02:06.901 --> 02:02:11.923]  There's a long-standing project to build an oil pipeline through there.
[02:02:12.543 --> 02:02:16.965]  There's all kinds of military, geopolitical, economic reasons.
[02:02:17.245 --> 02:02:18.126]  We're over there.
[02:02:18.646 --> 02:02:22.668]  And then, of course, you've got the rules of engagement, which would drive anybody crazy.
[02:02:23.388 --> 02:02:30.052]  You know, do you have to call back to get permission to kill somebody in case you don't know who they are and they might have a gun and they're ready to kill you?
[02:02:30.612 --> 02:02:32.773]  And you're gonna do two or three tours like this?
[02:02:33.573 --> 02:02:50.162]  I mean, the whole idea that, yes, we're over there, we're an army, we're not just an intelligence group, but we're an army, we're killing people, this is a war, but we can only kill certain people a certain amount of the time and we're helping other people build villages and so forth, all at the same time.
[02:02:50.202 --> 02:02:51.923]  This is not what an army does.
[02:02:52.563 --> 02:02:54.324]  This is not the way an army can operate.
[02:02:54.624 --> 02:02:56.286]  This creates crazy people.
[02:02:56.646 --> 02:02:57.927]  People that want to walk away.
[02:02:58.007 --> 02:02:59.428]  People that want to kill themselves.
[02:02:59.848 --> 02:03:16.700]  And then you put them on all kinds of psychiatric drugs which they use to self-medicate themselves over there that cause suicide like the SSRI antidepressants and you've got a complete catastrophe as witnessed by what's happening at the VA now.
[02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:27.996]  So, I go back to saying this is a major distraction, this whole prisoner exchange thing, to cover up the deep corruption at the VA.
[02:03:30.526 --> 02:03:31.567]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:03:31.947 --> 02:03:41.554]  Man, I tell you, I mean, I know they built Obama up as the savior, and he's meant to be politically destroyed by the end so a new savior can come in, but he is rotting on the vine really fast right now.
[02:03:41.574 --> 02:03:47.038]  I mean, can they leave him in another two years, or will he end up getting impeached or something?
[02:03:47.833 --> 02:03:49.454]  I don't see any way he can be impeached.
[02:03:49.514 --> 02:03:51.014]  He's there till the end.
[02:03:51.854 --> 02:03:59.217]  And then they're all, the media, are all going to try to celebrate his presidency and do all sorts of, you know, retrospectives.
[02:03:59.277 --> 02:04:01.818]  You can count on, you know, endless amounts.
[02:04:01.918 --> 02:04:02.338]  Exactly.
[02:04:02.378 --> 02:04:06.139]  They'll tear him down, let him fall on the sword, then they'll build him back up later.
[02:04:06.679 --> 02:04:06.959]  Sure.
[02:04:07.079 --> 02:04:08.140]  Just like they did to Clinton.
[02:04:09.020 --> 02:04:11.241]  And you even see it a little bit with Bush.
[02:04:12.002 --> 02:04:13.123]  They always do the same thing.
[02:04:13.583 --> 02:04:20.607]  And Obama is going to take place in the pantheon of great presidents eventually by revisionist history.
[02:04:21.553 --> 02:04:23.154]  But, that finally comes to an end.
[02:04:23.194 --> 02:04:30.738]  I mean, the cynicism, the 9% approval rating as low as 6 for Congress, I mean, this is not the same old cycle anymore.
[02:04:30.818 --> 02:04:31.879]  I don't see him getting away with it.
[02:04:31.919 --> 02:04:33.920]  I want to talk about that with you when we get back.
[02:04:34.140 --> 02:04:39.923]  And, something we talked about on the Sunday Show, that's why I wanted to get you back today, because we ran out of time.
[02:04:39.943 --> 02:04:42.024]  Let's spend some time on positive stuff first.
[02:04:42.444 --> 02:04:43.385]  What it is to be free.
[02:04:44.165 --> 02:04:49.250]  Where the world's going, how we can change ourselves inside to change the world outside.
[02:04:49.290 --> 02:04:53.333]  Then we'll get into energy and the energy game they're playing.
[02:04:53.353 --> 02:04:54.454]  I agree with your analysis.
[02:04:54.514 --> 02:04:57.136]  Some of the articles you've written at nomorefakenews.com.
[02:04:57.457 --> 02:05:03.322]  I want you to break down that deep, informed view coming up straight ahead and a little bit of Bilderberg news.
[02:05:03.582 --> 02:05:05.684]  With John Rappaport, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:05.724 --> 02:05:06.965]  This is GCNlive.com.
[02:05:09.614 --> 02:05:14.177]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:05:14.337 --> 02:05:17.299]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:05:17.459 --> 02:05:22.682]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:05:23.022 --> 02:05:24.683]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:05:24.963 --> 02:05:26.284]  We are what we eat.
[02:05:26.584 --> 02:05:29.206]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processes.
[02:05:29.206 --> 02:05:29.466]  I'm good.
[02:05:52.031 --> 02:05:54.133]  Who don't bow down to Big Pharma?
[02:05:54.273 --> 02:06:00.098]  The fight against the New World Order starts with you, and you can't stand against the machine of your sick, tired, and obese.

[02:06:09.625 --> 02:06:16.712]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:06:16.812 --> 02:06:18.955]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:06:19.155 --> 02:06:24.260]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:06:24.440 --> 02:06:29.385]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:06:29.585 --> 02:06:32.648]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:06:32.908 --> 02:06:36.772]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:06:36.992 --> 02:06:41.236]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:06:41.317 --> 02:06:51.346]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:06:51.546 --> 02:06:54.069]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:06:55.110 --> 02:07:02.295]  The new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:07:02.455 --> 02:07:06.417]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:07:10.182 --> 02:07:11.963]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[02:07:12.484 --> 02:07:19.428]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[02:07:19.908 --> 02:07:30.335]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[02:07:30.736 --> 02:07:39.962]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[02:07:40.702 --> 02:07:44.123]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[02:07:44.743 --> 02:07:48.164]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[02:07:48.524 --> 02:07:50.085]  Experience the new formula.
[02:07:50.585 --> 02:07:52.546]  Experience the ancient purity.
[02:07:53.146 --> 02:07:54.106]  Shield your family.
[02:07:54.486 --> 02:07:55.867]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:07:56.307 --> 02:07:58.888]  Available now at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:59.468 --> 02:08:03.429]  X2 from Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:08:26.152 --> 02:08:32.284]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:08:32.725 --> 02:08:34.167]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:08:37.133 --> 02:08:43.837]  That's right, and the GreatInfoWars.com crew with the nightly news studios and more are up there in Austin, Texas.
[02:08:45.057 --> 02:08:55.283]  I am down on the coast of Texas, you know, one week, not even vacation, working vacation with my children so that we can do a little bit of body surfing and spend time with them before they grow up.
[02:08:55.483 --> 02:08:58.385]  But I'm down here pretty much working about half, half speed.
[02:08:59.145 --> 02:09:07.074]  With the family, and we'll be co-hosting the news radio show all five days this week, at least part of the time.
[02:09:07.094 --> 02:09:09.777]  And we're going to have Paul Watson, David Knight, and so many others.
[02:09:10.137 --> 02:09:12.240]  Some of the stories up on Infowars.com.
[02:09:14.602 --> 02:09:16.863]  Burgled, if you pronounce it that way.
[02:09:17.863 --> 02:09:20.244]  Release arranged by CIA terror group.
[02:09:20.964 --> 02:09:25.486]  Police interrogate protesters for entering Bilderberg Hotel a day after they leave.
[02:09:25.506 --> 02:09:28.887]  There's video of that by Paul Joseph Watson on Infowars.com.
[02:09:29.247 --> 02:09:35.469]  White House launches propaganda at troll level, actually buying Google keywords now to put out their lies.
[02:09:36.596 --> 02:09:40.259]  Dems defend Obama's politically calculated release of terrorists.
[02:09:40.679 --> 02:09:43.902]  Bilderberg 2014, blowed wide open, a big boil-down article.
[02:09:44.342 --> 02:09:46.104]  Bilderberg 2014, George R.S.
[02:09:46.144 --> 02:09:48.305]  Bowen and the man at the center of everything.
[02:09:48.746 --> 02:09:53.429]  Mental health screening, a good way to decrease liberty, poor way to increase security, Ron Paul.
[02:09:54.090 --> 02:09:55.611]  The velocity of money in the U.S.
[02:09:55.871 --> 02:09:59.534]  falls to an all-time record low as the money's devalued.
[02:10:00.575 --> 02:10:14.760]  But first, I wanted to finish up with Bilderberg, and then get into some positive news with John Rappaport of nomorefakenews.com, who's giving us his commentary today, and will be hosting the last 40 minutes of the show today, just because I want to hear him do a presentation on what's really happening with energy.
[02:10:14.780 --> 02:10:15.901]  This affects everybody.
[02:10:16.521 --> 02:10:18.662]  I don't own stock in energy, or I don't work for it.
[02:10:19.382 --> 02:10:22.703]  Energy's your number one cost, and this is where they're really gaming us.
[02:10:22.743 --> 02:10:23.823]  You want to conquer somebody?
[02:10:24.124 --> 02:10:24.924]  Control the energy.
[02:10:26.087 --> 02:10:34.010]  So, we're gonna, from the calories our kids eat, to the oil in our cars, to the coal-powered plants, to the solar farms, to the wind farms, it's all gamed, folks.
[02:10:34.550 --> 02:10:37.451]  The globalists are scientific in their takeover, read eco-science.
[02:10:37.791 --> 02:10:40.452]  They break down the control of energy at every level.
[02:10:41.293 --> 02:10:49.856]  But, we saw them black out the windows at Bilderberg and put up fences and go to the greatest links ever in Copenhagen, Denmark, to block the public and the press this year.
[02:10:51.056 --> 02:10:51.557]  But then,
[02:10:52.964 --> 02:11:01.988]  On, like, the sixth floor, men all come up in robes, all holding on to each other, acting weird, and have some pretty boy come and wave at everybody and flaunt it at the media.
[02:11:02.708 --> 02:11:08.010]  And General Petraeus would come to the window and stare at people and others and just really act weird.
[02:11:08.530 --> 02:11:10.591]  And I guess they're really mad it's being exposed.
[02:11:10.611 --> 02:11:12.612]  They can't deny there's a shadow global government.
[02:11:13.152 --> 02:11:14.213]  This is really coming out.
[02:11:14.973 --> 02:11:17.234]  We're showing some video of that for TV viewers right now.
[02:11:17.334 --> 02:11:20.834]  Radio listeners can go to InfoWars.com and see the videos in HD.
[02:11:21.355 --> 02:11:24.075]  But what do you think's really behind all this?
[02:11:24.435 --> 02:11:30.757]  Black the windows out, but have multiple Bilderberg group members come out and talk to the press and the public, saying we're no big deal.
[02:11:31.157 --> 02:11:35.638]  But have other Bilderberg members tell the German press we actually pretty much run things.
[02:11:37.879 --> 02:11:43.382]  And the leader of the Dutch Parliament say, I don't violate the law being here to discuss government policy because we're public.
[02:11:43.722 --> 02:11:44.763]  Well, no, you're not public.
[02:11:45.343 --> 02:11:46.744]  So are they scared of indictment?
[02:11:46.764 --> 02:11:47.924]  There's talk of that in England.
[02:11:48.705 --> 02:11:58.170]  Why are they blocking out windows but leaving one open and having men, old men parade around with a pretty boy, you know, scantily clothed and in bath rubs?
[02:11:58.690 --> 02:12:00.171]  What is this really all about?
[02:12:00.691 --> 02:12:04.553]  Are they acting like they don't care that we know because they actually do care?
[02:12:04.613 --> 02:12:05.294]  John Rappaport.
[02:12:06.695 --> 02:12:16.342]  It's a complicated situation, but point number one is, I think they have to make a pretense that this is now public.
[02:12:17.262 --> 02:12:17.843]  Because it is.
[02:12:18.403 --> 02:12:19.684]  Because it's been exposed.
[02:12:20.525 --> 02:12:31.153]  So, they can't go around anymore saying, Secret Bilderberg, Secret Bilderberg, because everybody knows about it now, or, I mean, through Infowars and other alternative media.
[02:12:31.989 --> 02:12:39.272]  People realize it, so they have to make a pretense of saying they're public, otherwise they could be indicted.
[02:12:39.772 --> 02:12:46.834]  They could be indicted for doing national government business as an international secret society, which they are.
[02:12:47.614 --> 02:12:48.695]  So on the one hand,
[02:12:49.395 --> 02:12:55.359]  They've got to now sort of give the impression, hey, we're not trying to conceal anything.
[02:12:55.860 --> 02:13:00.963]  Here we are, you know, and we'll have a conversation with you and with you and so on and so forth.
[02:13:01.444 --> 02:13:05.507]  On the other hand, you've got some of the crazier members.
[02:13:06.368 --> 02:13:18.189]  Uh, who are still back in the Stone Age trying to conceal the whole thing and blocking out windows, and then you've got the real loons in their, you know, white bathrobes doing God knows what.
[02:13:18.309 --> 02:13:19.150]  Reminds me of
[02:13:19.983 --> 02:13:20.883]  I mean, you can't.
[02:13:44.749 --> 02:13:55.157]  No nation's laws permit government people to go to a secret international conference and make policy decisions outside their own government.
[02:13:55.237 --> 02:13:59.000]  I mean, they put you in prison for that if they catch you or if they want to catch you.
[02:13:59.580 --> 02:14:02.822]  So that's why I think you're seeing a little bit of this.
[02:14:03.363 --> 02:14:05.745]  Oh, you know, we're just a bunch of guys sitting around.
[02:14:05.805 --> 02:14:07.226]  Of course, we're meeting here.
[02:14:07.606 --> 02:14:08.987]  We're not trying to hide anything.
[02:14:12.639 --> 02:14:16.721]  And I looked up the floor plan of that Marriott conference center.
[02:14:17.722 --> 02:14:20.003]  The gym is down on the lower floor.
[02:14:21.084 --> 02:14:31.169]  They were in a suite in a bunch of bathrobes holding on to each other with a pretty boy in the middle of them, flaunting and teasing everyone.
[02:14:32.089 --> 02:14:34.231]  And, I mean, that's very sophomoric behavior.
[02:14:34.851 --> 02:14:36.572]  And I don't know what the point of it is.
[02:14:36.812 --> 02:14:37.653]  And I agree with you.
[02:14:37.673 --> 02:14:40.275]  It just, it shows different factions, and that's what it is.
[02:14:40.775 --> 02:14:43.557]  Bidding for control of the main levers of power.
[02:14:43.937 --> 02:14:45.778]  Now, I want to talk about the essence of being free.
[02:14:45.818 --> 02:14:47.179]  We don't need government to make us free.
[02:14:48.220 --> 02:14:51.002]  We begin to act like free beings, and the rest will follow.
[02:14:52.264 --> 02:14:54.325]  We ran out of time Sunday talking about that.
[02:14:54.345 --> 02:14:56.866]  I wanted to recap that briefly as we go to break.
[02:14:57.186 --> 02:15:10.291]  But before we go there and come back with your energy presentation that I won't be here for, we'll have a six-minute segment, an 18-minute segment, and a six-minute segment to finish out the show here today because I don't want you to be interrupted getting into that, John.
[02:15:11.789 --> 02:15:12.989]  But I want to be clear on energy.
[02:15:13.710 --> 02:15:15.110]  I want to explore our oil.
[02:15:15.871 --> 02:15:17.831]  I want to explore natural gas.
[02:15:18.151 --> 02:15:21.553]  I want to use coal, because we have clean-burning plants, because that's the energy we have.
[02:15:22.093 --> 02:15:25.234]  But I also know they've blocked a lot of the free energy, the zero-point stuff.
[02:15:25.534 --> 02:15:37.599]  It's come out they've been blocking it, discrediting it, trying to control the new energy systems by only giving money to their friends who never even build anything, or build something that's a fraud, or build something that's 60-year-old alternative energy.
[02:15:38.619 --> 02:15:40.220]  So they're blocking renaissance in this.
[02:15:40.300 --> 02:15:47.286]  And some of the alternative energy people go, how dare you promote an oil boom in the US while claiming you're for new forms of energy.
[02:15:47.306 --> 02:15:48.186]  Well, that's hypocritical.
[02:15:48.486 --> 02:15:49.647]  Of course I'm for more.
[02:15:49.967 --> 02:15:52.069]  Whatever we've currently got, we need more of.
[02:15:52.509 --> 02:15:53.790]  Better than the Saudi Arabians.
[02:15:53.850 --> 02:15:56.893]  Better to have low prices while developing new systems.
[02:15:56.973 --> 02:15:58.113]  I don't think the two
[02:15:59.355 --> 02:16:00.896]  Conflict with each other at all.
[02:16:01.796 --> 02:16:05.418]  I mean, I'm absolutely for North American oil exploration.
[02:16:05.878 --> 02:16:06.819]  I want it to be done good.
[02:16:06.839 --> 02:16:08.440]  I don't like fracking in populated areas.
[02:16:08.460 --> 02:16:10.741]  There's a good way to do fracking versus a bad way.
[02:16:11.381 --> 02:16:13.362]  They can define fracking as any type of drilling.
[02:16:13.782 --> 02:16:15.283]  So, I mean, it's the Saudi Arabians.
[02:16:15.323 --> 02:16:18.005]  We've caught them funding the main anti-fracking movement.
[02:16:18.045 --> 02:16:18.685]  That's just a fact.
[02:16:19.734 --> 02:16:22.816]  Uh, you know, and because they don't want stuff being developed here.
[02:16:23.076 --> 02:16:25.038]  Well, most of our oil exploration is not fracking.
[02:16:25.438 --> 02:16:27.559]  So I want to let you break it all down coming up.
[02:16:27.599 --> 02:16:29.220]  I wanted to throw that in.
[02:16:29.541 --> 02:16:30.781]  Now take us out to break.
[02:16:31.102 --> 02:16:33.623]  We're going to break here in about three minutes.
[02:16:33.643 --> 02:16:35.244]  So I'm now going to turn things over to you, John.
[02:16:35.264 --> 02:16:35.945]  You'll hear the music.
[02:16:36.385 --> 02:16:42.888]  You take us out, you intro us, we'll take the training wheels off here and let you host the show because you're, you know, a great guy and I know can do it.
[02:16:43.249 --> 02:16:49.892]  But briefly, take us out what the essence of freedom is for John Rappaport and I will see everybody else tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[02:16:49.952 --> 02:16:52.613]  Central here with the weekday show.
[02:16:53.214 --> 02:16:55.795]  Alex Jones handing the baton off to John Rappaport.
[02:16:56.335 --> 02:16:57.236]  Thanks so much Alex.
[02:16:58.116 --> 02:17:01.278]  At the end of the Sunday conversation that we had
[02:17:02.256 --> 02:17:08.462]  You made the point, and it's absolutely correct, that freedom is not something that's given to you by the government.
[02:17:09.103 --> 02:17:12.526]  I don't care what the documents are, even the founding documents.
[02:17:13.447 --> 02:17:18.432]  The founding documents did not create freedom as if it had never existed before.
[02:17:19.152 --> 02:17:21.054]  You individually have your freedom.
[02:17:21.114 --> 02:17:22.416]  You've always had your freedom.
[02:17:22.976 --> 02:17:30.540]  Everybody has that potential within them, and they have to know what that means at a profound level, not just some superficial level.
[02:17:30.580 --> 02:17:42.966]  Because once you understand what it really means, your own freedom, independent from anything else, then you begin to understand what you need to do now in this situation that we find ourselves in.
[02:17:43.006 --> 02:17:44.407]  That's the big one.
[02:17:44.968 --> 02:17:46.228]  But that's the first step.
[02:17:46.768 --> 02:17:49.450]  The Constitution did not create freedom.
[02:17:50.911 --> 02:17:58.294]  The Articles of Confederation, the Declaration of Independence, they did not give people freedom that was never there to begin with.
[02:17:59.254 --> 02:18:02.535]  It confirmed the freedom that every individual has.
[02:18:03.075 --> 02:18:10.938]  And think of the disaster if individuals don't understand within themselves what their own freedom really is at the most profound level.
[02:18:11.478 --> 02:18:12.178]  Then we're done.
[02:18:13.099 --> 02:18:14.139]  That has to change.
[02:18:14.879 --> 02:18:16.800]  That has to really, really change.
[02:18:19.594 --> 02:18:23.675]  So, that's where we're going with that conversation about freedom.
[02:18:24.856 --> 02:18:32.758]  It means that every individual begins with a contemplation of what his own liberty and freedom really means to him.
[02:18:33.559 --> 02:18:38.600]  Does it mean that you can buy a soda at the 7-Eleven instead of at the liquor store?
[02:18:39.220 --> 02:18:40.081]  Is that where it goes?
[02:18:40.461 --> 02:18:46.283]  Does it mean that you can buy, you know, a two-seater couch instead of a chair?
[02:18:47.243 --> 02:18:52.985]  Or a 1999 car that's been completely remodeled?
[02:18:53.045 --> 02:18:55.486]  I mean, is that the limit of what freedom means?
[02:18:55.906 --> 02:18:57.227]  That you can take a vacation?
[02:18:57.307 --> 02:18:58.347]  Is that what it's all about?
[02:18:58.407 --> 02:19:00.048]  Is that the beginning and the end of it?
[02:19:00.988 --> 02:19:09.811]  Is freedom mean that you can shut your eyes to what's happening in the world and that nobody's going to punish you for retreating into a little burrow somewhere?
[02:19:09.891 --> 02:19:11.172]  Is that what your freedom means?
[02:19:12.772 --> 02:19:14.473]  Nobody can say to you
[02:19:16.704 --> 02:19:17.484]  What your freedom?
[02:19:17.544 --> 02:19:18.445]  You have to find it.
[02:19:19.185 --> 02:19:20.206]  You have to decide.
[02:19:20.646 --> 02:19:31.652]  And you have to go down below the everyday nonsense of social conversation and mainstream media and so forth to find out what that is.
[02:19:32.052 --> 02:19:35.394]  You would think that would be part of the educational system, don't you think so?
[02:19:36.034 --> 02:19:43.979]  Thomas Jefferson, as part of the founding of the public education system, wanted it to be the education of citizens.
[02:19:44.839 --> 02:19:45.780]  Because why?
[02:19:46.261 --> 02:19:51.345]  Because, he said, this was a republic, unlike any other form of government that ever existed.
[02:19:51.365 --> 02:20:00.594]  Therefore, the entire purpose of the education system should be to educate children into understanding what the role of a citizen would be in a republic.
[02:20:02.335 --> 02:20:04.097]  Do you find any discussion of freedom now?
[02:20:04.117 --> 02:20:04.457]  In schools?
[02:20:07.051 --> 02:20:07.491]  No, you don't.
[02:20:08.392 --> 02:20:09.713]  You'll be back on InfoWars.

[02:24:19.701 --> 02:24:29.368]  Just to wrap up what I was saying about freedom, do you know any schools in America where this is the issue, as it should be?
[02:24:30.789 --> 02:24:37.313]  I'll write a 2,000 word essay on what it means to you to be free in this country now.
[02:24:38.354 --> 02:24:38.794]  Why not?
[02:24:39.775 --> 02:24:40.715]  Indeed, why not?
[02:24:41.136 --> 02:24:42.557]  What could be a greater issue?
[02:24:42.897 --> 02:24:47.640]  But if you happen to bring that up in the school these days, I mean, you could be suspended.
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:49.001]  Who knows what would happen?
[02:24:50.057 --> 02:24:56.391]  Individual freedom in an elementary school, in a high school, in a college, university.
[02:24:57.512 --> 02:24:58.413]  You could be stoned.
[02:24:58.733 --> 02:25:00.214]  I mean, this is verboten.
[02:25:00.614 --> 02:25:02.435]  You cannot bring up this subject.
[02:25:02.575 --> 02:25:08.779]  This is not a subject for discussion, much less assignment in classes.
[02:25:09.499 --> 02:25:22.667]  Professor gets up at the beginning of a class in college and says, the most important thing you can learn about in college is your individual freedom, and that's what we're going to focus on in this class in Philosophy of Oubladi, whatever.
[02:25:24.744 --> 02:25:28.527]  That guy's on a short leash from that moment on, that teacher.
[02:25:29.488 --> 02:25:34.953]  His career is going to be sidetracked if he persists in that.
[02:25:35.573 --> 02:25:37.515]  And yet, that's the basis of the country.
[02:25:38.095 --> 02:25:40.517]  That's what the Constitution was, Declaration of Independence.
[02:25:40.998 --> 02:25:41.678]  What happened?
[02:25:42.159 --> 02:25:43.320]  Complete overthrow.
[02:25:43.340 --> 02:25:44.160]  That's what happened.
[02:25:45.962 --> 02:25:50.986]  But that doesn't stop you, as an individual, from doing that work.
[02:25:51.547 --> 02:25:52.868]  Because when you hit page
[02:25:54.469 --> 02:26:04.278]  And you really understand, at the most profound level, what your freedom really means, what it is, then you know what to do.
[02:26:04.579 --> 02:26:05.460]  Then you understand.
[02:26:05.760 --> 02:26:07.201]  Then you can apply your mind.
[02:26:08.242 --> 02:26:18.632]  Not to some harebrained scheme, but to something that's going to contribute to turning this whole massive fascist oligarchy around.
[02:26:19.092 --> 02:26:19.353]  Okay.
[02:26:21.045 --> 02:26:21.485]  Energy.
[02:26:22.546 --> 02:26:26.748]  So now 30% we're going to cut 30% of coal.
[02:26:26.808 --> 02:26:28.689]  No problem, the president says.
[02:26:29.009 --> 02:26:31.371]  This in fact is going to create more jobs.
[02:26:31.431 --> 02:26:32.031]  It's a miracle.
[02:26:32.371 --> 02:26:35.953]  I mean he's got to be a magician if not an outright messiah.
[02:26:36.954 --> 02:26:42.997]  If he can cut coal by 30% and yet in the process create more jobs and
[02:26:44.522 --> 02:26:45.583]  And even more energy.
[02:26:45.783 --> 02:26:49.307]  This is like saying today is tomorrow, night is day, day is night.
[02:26:49.407 --> 02:26:51.890]  It's all 1984 lingo.
[02:26:52.831 --> 02:27:04.903]  At the same time, as Alex said in the last segment, and this is very important, you've got to keep the energy you have while you actually develop energy of the future.
[02:27:07.802 --> 02:27:20.847]  And I'm sorry to insult certain environmentalists about this, who I guess want to go back into the forest and scratch on the ground for roots and tubers and depopulate the planet down to about 100 million people.
[02:27:21.187 --> 02:27:30.710]  But in a society of civilization, you've got to keep the energy you have while you develop actual new energy, not phony new energy, real
[02:27:32.486 --> 02:27:32.666]  I think?
[02:28:02.540 --> 02:28:07.464]  He discovered a way to transfer solar energy into pipes within panels.
[02:28:07.924 --> 02:28:18.773]  And in fact, he built a factory in Egypt, which apparently runs to this present day, based entirely on solar in Mahadi.
[02:28:19.454 --> 02:28:23.517]  Pumps out 6,000 gallons of water, this solar
[02:28:24.991 --> 02:28:26.032]  That's pretty good.
[02:28:39.349 --> 02:28:40.930]  The real technology back then.
[02:28:41.351 --> 02:28:42.552]  This had real legs.
[02:28:42.972 --> 02:28:59.026]  This could be utilized, in fact was utilized, if you look at old photographs of Los Angeles all the way along the line in the early teens of the 20th century, you could see solar panels on all the houses until the oil boom hit.
[02:28:59.426 --> 02:29:03.669]  And it became obvious that this could be a monopoly for the few.
[02:29:04.390 --> 02:29:05.951]  I mean, we may not be able to control
[02:29:06.872 --> 02:29:12.019]  Well the sun, boys, because everybody's got access to it, but we can certainly control the oil.
[02:29:12.460 --> 02:29:13.441]  So what we have to do...
[02:29:14.975 --> 02:29:34.789]  Is destroy, suppress, defame, propagandize against all other forms of phony phony baloney energy and say it's all about oil, it always was and it always will be and you still to this day hear propaganda with that line whenever anybody really seriously brings up alternative energy.
[02:29:34.829 --> 02:29:38.772]  I'm not talking about Obama or Bush or Clinton alternative energy.
[02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:51.223]  I'm talking about the real things, which is a separate issue, quite apart from these phony schemes to create what looks like alternative energy, when it actually isn't.
[02:29:51.604 --> 02:29:53.284]  We're going out here at the bottom of the hour.
[02:29:53.544 --> 02:29:58.266]  I'm sitting in for Alex Jones, this is John Rappaport, and we will be back after this break.
[02:29:58.906 --> 02:30:01.907]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.827 --> 02:30:05.508]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.628 --> 02:30:10.429]  I don't know what it is.
[02:30:10.649 --> 02:30:12.390]  Ralph just won't pay any attention to me.
[02:30:12.531 --> 02:30:16.474]  When he comes home from work, all he ever does is play video games and go to sleep.
[02:30:16.654 --> 02:30:17.875]  It's like I don't even exist.
[02:30:18.235 --> 02:30:20.057]  Oh Betty, that's just awful.
[02:30:20.197 --> 02:30:21.398]  Does this seem familiar?
[02:30:21.558 --> 02:30:24.160]  If the answer to this question is yes, then listen carefully.
[02:30:24.280 --> 02:30:34.629]  Toxic pesticides, GMO foods and additives, BPA plastics, contaminated water supplies, many of these toxic additives are deliberately engineered to attack and weaken human masculinity.
[02:30:34.769 --> 02:30:37.271]  It's part of the eugenics population control movement.
[02:30:37.472 --> 02:30:37.912]  Look it up.
[02:30:38.152 --> 02:30:44.840]  If men are more interested in online gaming than they are in their wives, a serious population crisis is soon to follow.
[02:30:45.020 --> 02:30:50.126]  Energize the man in your life with Super Male Vitality from InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:31:09.525 --> 02:31:12.107]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:31:12.367 --> 02:31:17.250]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:31:17.491 --> 02:31:25.376]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:31:25.616 --> 02:31:29.939]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:31:30.139 --> 02:31:33.942]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:31:34.102 --> 02:31:39.804]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:31:40.044 --> 02:31:42.824]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:31:43.204 --> 02:31:48.446]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[02:31:48.586 --> 02:31:56.708]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[02:31:56.768 --> 02:31:56.948]  That's 866-229-0927.
[02:32:03.570 --> 02:32:05.658]  Business with someone who shares your values.

[02:32:09.289 --> 02:32:13.310]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:32:13.350 --> 02:32:17.491]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:32:17.711 --> 02:32:21.112]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:32:21.372 --> 02:32:24.253]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:32:24.413 --> 02:32:31.775]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins of heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:32:31.995 --> 02:32:35.616]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:32:35.836 --> 02:32:40.139]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:32:40.299 --> 02:32:46.243]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:32:46.283 --> 02:32:50.045]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:32:50.205 --> 02:32:52.747]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:32:52.947 --> 02:32:54.308]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:32:54.468 --> 02:32:55.689]  It's time to take action.
[02:32:55.829 --> 02:32:57.530]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:33:06.575 --> 02:33:07.416]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:35.216 --> 02:33:38.500]  This is John Rattenporth sitting in for Alex Jones for the rest of the hour.
[02:33:38.520 --> 02:33:44.608]  I just want to mention the tremendous work that all the crew at Infowars do.
[02:33:45.409 --> 02:33:50.495]  I mean, because I've been a reporter for 30 years, I understand how operations work.
[02:33:50.916 --> 02:33:52.758]  And to put this together without
[02:33:53.559 --> 02:33:58.002]  You know, government subsidies and all kinds of easy cash.
[02:33:58.422 --> 02:34:08.369]  To actually make this an entrepreneurial news independent operation is far from easy, especially with about 50 people on board.
[02:34:08.949 --> 02:34:16.855]  The reporters and the crew do a great job and they finance this whole operation on the basis of
[02:34:18.174 --> 02:34:30.888]  The products that they tell you about, that you buy, that are the best products they can possibly bring to you, that you will find at infowarslife.com, which is the store.
[02:34:31.588 --> 02:34:39.357]  Especially two new products, X2, which is a nascent iodine, and Super Female Vitality.
[02:34:40.393 --> 02:34:42.695]  Those are two of the newest products in the store.
[02:34:43.295 --> 02:34:44.676]  I urge you to look into this.
[02:34:44.996 --> 02:34:56.024]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com, the store, and support the crew at InfoWars and get yourself access to unique products at the same time.
[02:34:57.245 --> 02:34:57.585]  Okay?
[02:34:58.106 --> 02:34:58.426]  Okay.
[02:34:58.826 --> 02:34:59.687]  Make sure you do that.
[02:35:01.608 --> 02:35:03.189]  We're getting back to energy.
[02:35:03.630 --> 02:35:06.872]  And of course, those products are about energy.
[02:35:07.012 --> 02:35:08.193]  Energy is everywhere.
[02:35:09.707 --> 02:35:11.448]  How much energy do you have today?
[02:35:12.349 --> 02:35:13.170]  Can you last?
[02:35:13.330 --> 02:35:14.450]  Can you get through the day?
[02:35:14.851 --> 02:35:16.552]  How many cups of coffee do you need?
[02:35:16.832 --> 02:35:18.033]  How many Red Bulls?
[02:35:18.633 --> 02:35:21.796]  Everybody is involved with energy on some level.
[02:35:22.016 --> 02:35:31.463]  Whether it's personal energy, energy to run their machines, their devices, their cars, their houses, their offices, places of business.
[02:35:31.883 --> 02:35:35.586]  The society, the civilization runs on energy.
[02:35:37.867 --> 02:35:38.728]  So what's the problem?
[02:35:39.963 --> 02:35:42.326]  Well, we don't have a problem with that.
[02:35:42.626 --> 02:35:51.456]  The problem is that the people who control this planet, the elites, they want to dominate the energy.
[02:35:53.123 --> 02:35:53.683]  Monopoly.
[02:35:53.743 --> 02:35:54.264]  Cartel.
[02:35:54.284 --> 02:35:55.444]  That's what we're talking about.
[02:35:56.285 --> 02:35:59.767]  And oil is the perfect mechanism for this to do.
[02:36:00.627 --> 02:36:04.289]  And they can foment wars in the Middle East, where a lot of the oil is.
[02:36:04.729 --> 02:36:06.770]  And they can make oil seem scarcer.
[02:36:07.150 --> 02:36:08.511]  And they can raise the price.
[02:36:08.591 --> 02:36:10.732]  And they can manipulate the price up and down.
[02:36:11.173 --> 02:36:16.055]  Because they control the basic energy commodity of the planet.
[02:36:17.836 --> 02:36:18.897]  In their view,
[02:36:20.444 --> 02:36:22.045]  Which they are promoting to you.
[02:36:22.945 --> 02:36:23.706]  To everybody.
[02:36:24.246 --> 02:36:25.387]  This is what we have, folks.
[02:36:25.567 --> 02:36:26.307]  We have oil.
[02:36:26.367 --> 02:36:27.187]  That's all we have.
[02:36:27.368 --> 02:36:28.668]  There's nothing else, really.
[02:36:29.088 --> 02:36:35.271]  If we give up the oil, we're all going to go into the darkness and the chaos, which is a complete lie.
[02:36:35.852 --> 02:36:39.754]  Because there have been many suppressed energy technologies.
[02:36:40.214 --> 02:36:48.718]  Not the woo-woo fairy tale, I put a crystal on the mantle and looked at it and suddenly my car started driving down the street.
[02:36:48.898 --> 02:36:49.899]  I'm not talking about that.
[02:36:51.098 --> 02:36:54.801]  I'm talking about Frank Schumann that I spoke about in the last segment.
[02:36:55.261 --> 02:37:03.607]  This was a guy, an engineer, who pioneered engines that ran on solar in the beginning of the 20th century.
[02:37:04.128 --> 02:37:05.208]  What happened to that?
[02:37:05.969 --> 02:37:14.915]  That was an existing, workable, useful, dramatic breakthrough technology right then and there at the beginning of the 20th century.
[02:37:17.277 --> 02:37:28.005]  1913 started pumping 6,000 gallons of water per minute through that solar energy off of the Nile into cotton fields in Egypt.
[02:37:29.226 --> 02:37:31.668]  You would think somebody would get a clue from that.
[02:37:33.109 --> 02:37:33.989]  Revolutionizing.
[02:37:34.009 --> 02:37:37.312]  Let me tell you about something really extraordinary.
[02:37:38.513 --> 02:37:39.673]  Passamaquoddy.
[02:37:40.754 --> 02:37:41.735]  Passamaquoddy.
[02:37:43.336 --> 02:37:45.417]  The Maine, state of Maine,
[02:37:46.423 --> 02:37:56.593]  Passamaquoddy Tidal Basin Project that JFK was obsessively interested in since his days as a U.S.
[02:37:56.633 --> 02:37:56.993]  Senator.
[02:37:57.013 --> 02:38:00.777]  We're talking the late 1950s.
[02:38:01.017 --> 02:38:04.261]  In 1959, he went up to the state of Maine and looked over this proposal.
[02:38:05.001 --> 02:38:25.097]  To build a tidal basin project right off the coast of Maine with a huge turbine because the height of the water tide every day was very high, very low, very high, very low, very good for turning a turbine and creating electricity.
[02:38:25.457 --> 02:38:29.520]  An enormous amount of electricity, get this, for the state of Maine.
[02:38:32.303 --> 02:38:32.363]  In 1962
[02:38:34.488 --> 02:38:35.678]  He commissioned a report.
[02:38:35.718 --> 02:38:36.786]  He was president then.
[02:38:37.674 --> 02:38:39.675]  What is happening with Passamaquoddy?
[02:38:39.955 --> 02:38:42.055]  It's being stalled all these years.
[02:38:42.595 --> 02:38:44.636]  Different entities are fighting over it.
[02:38:44.696 --> 02:38:46.977]  Different cartels are trying to stop it.
[02:38:47.157 --> 02:38:48.157]  I want a report.
[02:38:48.637 --> 02:38:51.218]  The report was turned in to President Kennedy.
[02:38:51.798 --> 02:38:56.939]  It was a positive report on the possibilities from Passamaquoddy.
[02:38:57.680 --> 02:38:59.200]  The Tidal Basin Project.
[02:38:59.280 --> 02:39:01.581]  Shortly after that, JFK was murdered.
[02:39:02.201 --> 02:39:05.402]  And the whole project went into abeyance.
[02:39:07.378 --> 02:39:10.083]  It's not just the Passamaquoddy Project.
[02:39:10.684 --> 02:39:13.168]  It's anywhere in the country, in America.
[02:39:13.609 --> 02:39:15.271]  It's anywhere in the world.
[02:39:16.581 --> 02:39:20.582]  Where there is a coastal inlet that has those conditions.
[02:39:21.363 --> 02:39:29.665]  There are many, many, many, many coastal inlets all over the world that could be used to build these water turbine projects.
[02:39:30.106 --> 02:39:35.627]  This is not woo-woo, fairy tale, up in the clouds, alternative energy.
[02:39:36.048 --> 02:39:43.890]  This is straight ahead, down the line, electricity production, using the ocean, using the tides and turbines.
[02:39:44.450 --> 02:39:45.851]  Everybody knows about this.
[02:39:47.190 --> 02:39:58.237]  There's at least one company I researched some years ago, there are probably more now, that can put small turbines in rivers and produce energy for local communities.
[02:39:59.137 --> 02:40:02.159]  This is not strange, weird stuff.
[02:40:02.259 --> 02:40:03.259]  This is real stuff.
[02:40:03.340 --> 02:40:12.705]  And remember, Nikola Tesla, the famous inventor, when he died, the FBI instantly raided his hotel room and took
[02:40:16.016 --> 02:40:19.818]  What are we talking about when we talk about human health, folks?
[02:40:45.475 --> 02:40:46.096]  Think about this.
[02:40:46.156 --> 02:40:46.476]  Come on.
[02:40:47.056 --> 02:40:48.097]  We're talking about energy.
[02:40:48.418 --> 02:40:53.462]  What's the difference in energy level between a very sick person and a very healthy person?
[02:40:54.443 --> 02:40:55.444]  Human energy.
[02:40:55.844 --> 02:40:57.746]  Not just energy to run cars.
[02:40:58.086 --> 02:40:58.947]  Human energy.
[02:41:00.307 --> 02:41:19.117]  We've had a great deal of suppressed research about that, starting, not starting with, but including Royal Reif, the famous scientist in Southern California who developed his own breakthrough microscope that could observe microorganisms in action.
[02:41:20.490 --> 02:41:30.952]  And his frequency generator that he used to experiment on these microorganisms and kill off destructive ones with frequencies.
[02:41:32.333 --> 02:41:37.474]  In his time, you can see the newspaper articles, they appeared in Southern California.
[02:41:37.794 --> 02:41:48.456]  He was heralded as a genius by medical authorities until he decided not to cooperate with them to form any sort of cooperative business.
[02:41:48.456 --> 02:41:53.419]  This venture, at which point he became persona non grata, at which point he became a fraud.
[02:41:53.519 --> 02:41:55.540]  All of a sudden, the man was a fraud.
[02:41:55.900 --> 02:41:58.262]  He was a genius yesterday, now he's a fraud.
[02:41:58.342 --> 02:41:59.422]  Now he's dangerous.
[02:41:59.803 --> 02:42:00.723]  Now he's evil.
[02:42:01.063 --> 02:42:05.746]  Now he's distracting people away from what can really cure cancer.
[02:42:07.607 --> 02:42:08.368]  Oh, baby.
[02:42:09.448 --> 02:42:15.792]  Rife cured, what was it, 16 people with cancer who were seriously ill with cancer.
[02:42:16.724 --> 02:42:21.608]  The newspaper articles appeared on this, it was verified, and then suddenly it never happened.
[02:42:21.768 --> 02:42:22.869]  Suddenly it didn't happen.
[02:42:24.610 --> 02:42:29.654]  Do you realize what we're talking about in terms of human energy uptake?
[02:42:30.415 --> 02:42:36.540]  The difference between somebody who's in desperate straits with cancer and a cured individual?
[02:42:38.001 --> 02:42:40.222]  What about Stan Brzezinski down in Texas?
[02:42:41.483 --> 02:42:41.944]  Houston?
[02:42:43.032 --> 02:42:43.472]  What is it?
[02:42:43.612 --> 02:42:57.619]  Seven grand juries, state and federal, that have been mounted to destroy Brzezinski because he invented his own medicine to treat cancer that was not part of the pharmaceutical complex.
[02:42:59.340 --> 02:43:01.401]  That worked on a number of patients.
[02:43:02.822 --> 02:43:08.285]  Brzezinski never overstated what he could do with his medicine, neoplastins.
[02:43:09.865 --> 02:43:11.266]  He continued to do research.
[02:43:11.306 --> 02:43:12.687]  He continued to treat people.
[02:43:14.688 --> 02:43:24.790]  I know a guy in Los Angeles, personally, who lives for, I'm going to say, 20 to 25 years longer than doctors said he could because he was treated by Brzezinski.
[02:43:26.050 --> 02:43:32.891]  And yet now, tremendous strictures and restraints on which patients Brzezinski is allowed to treat.
[02:43:33.852 --> 02:43:35.272]  Who can come to his clinic?
[02:43:35.332 --> 02:43:37.952]  What can he do with people as a doctor?
[02:43:39.212 --> 02:43:41.833]  And the legal assault never seems to stop on the guy.
[02:43:42.947 --> 02:43:44.608]  Grand jury after grand jury.
[02:43:44.908 --> 02:43:51.232]  They can indict a ham sandwich, is the saying about a grand jury, but no grand jury ever indicted Brzezinski.
[02:43:51.672 --> 02:43:52.033]  Why?
[02:43:52.373 --> 02:44:07.522]  Because they all realized that the DAs and the prosecutors were lying through their teeth when they tried to destroy this humanitarian doctor in Texas, and so they refused to turn back permission to prosecute.
[02:44:09.735 --> 02:44:20.362]  We're talking about human energy there, which is at least as vital as the energy to power a civilization through cables, through wireless means, whatever.
[02:44:20.662 --> 02:44:29.407]  We're looking at suppression of alternative technologies from top to bottom, all over the place, everywhere.
[02:44:29.787 --> 02:44:36.752]  And this JFK-Passamaquoddy story, you check it out on Google in depth.
[02:44:38.035 --> 02:44:45.700]  Andrea Silberthorn, I believe is the woman's name, who did the original research on the full story behind this.
[02:44:45.900 --> 02:44:46.761]  The full story.
[02:44:47.401 --> 02:44:50.923]  We're talking about, you want a conspiracy and a scandal?
[02:44:50.943 --> 02:44:57.668]  A devastating scandal that ends up, one way or another, with the murder of the U.S.
[02:44:57.748 --> 02:44:58.208]  President?
[02:44:58.808 --> 02:45:05.413]  And a project to liberate the country from oil monopolies?
[02:45:06.653 --> 02:45:07.554]  Pastor McQuaddie.
[02:45:10.450 --> 02:45:13.554]  These are incredible stories that I'm talking about here.
[02:45:14.135 --> 02:45:15.577]  Incredible human events.
[02:45:16.057 --> 02:45:17.519]  And what do they all point to?
[02:45:18.200 --> 02:45:21.745]  They point to the fact that for a very long time,
[02:45:23.183 --> 02:45:51.297]  We, the human race, have had the capacity to produce energy abundance in every conceivable way from many different vectors on this planet, and that this has been suppressed by the energy cartels and monopolies, and by the secret societies like Bilderberg, or like the Council on Foreign Relations, like the Trilateral Commission, like the CIA, like many different groups.
[02:45:52.642 --> 02:46:01.985]  Behind the scenes, like megacorporations operating in concert with intelligence agencies, I'm not blowing smoke here, folks.
[02:46:03.205 --> 02:46:09.127]  Abundance is a viable principle that exists now for everybody on the planet.
[02:46:10.968 --> 02:46:16.009]  Through the means that have been discovered and invented, and then suppressed.
[02:46:17.209 --> 02:46:22.211]  Suppressed to create the scarcity that we now face.
[02:46:23.243 --> 02:46:43.127]  The artificial money scarcity, the artificial job destruction, the artificial health destruction through the practice of toxic modern medicine, the artificial destruction of different avenues of energy from solar and ocean to more sophisticated means, as in the case of Tesla.
[02:46:44.567 --> 02:46:47.328]  The destruction of all of that by their suppression.
[02:46:48.487 --> 02:46:55.391]  So that you and I and everybody else are now living in an artificially created world.
[02:46:57.232 --> 02:47:01.395]  That's the reality that has been imposed upon us.
[02:47:02.175 --> 02:47:15.223]  And thousands and hundreds of thousands of lying, deceiving, scum, propagandists, public pundits, fake scientists have cooperated, have sold their souls
[02:47:16.835 --> 02:47:34.443]  To prop up the idea that we are living in a world on a planet of extreme scarcity and it's tooth for tooth, claw against claw, all the way, when that has not been the case for a very long time.
[02:47:35.604 --> 02:47:39.446]  This is the secret in the temple of the monopolies.
[02:47:40.506 --> 02:47:41.987]  This is what they are concealing.
[02:47:42.707 --> 02:47:45.669]  And in the field of energy, it's absolutely monstrous.
[02:47:47.205 --> 02:48:00.394]  And there are many more energy breakthroughs that I could mention here, but I wanted to focus on a few to set you exploring, to set you finding out for yourself.
[02:48:00.954 --> 02:48:02.075]  This is the case.
[02:48:02.916 --> 02:48:15.184]  When you drive your car to the pump and you look at the price, you're not just looking at the manipulated money price of oil, you're looking at a far greater manipulation.
[02:48:16.277 --> 02:48:25.744]  You're looking at the destruction of societies and civilizations based on this premise that oil is all we've got, folks.
[02:48:26.124 --> 02:48:28.325]  Oil is all we'll ever have.
[02:48:29.826 --> 02:48:37.552]  And to assure you once again, I'm not with the people who say, well, we have to shut down all the oil, and while we're at it, all the coal, and shut down everything.
[02:48:38.342 --> 02:48:45.867]  Because I want to go out into the forest and crawl along the floor and eat roots and tubers and live in a tree.
[02:48:45.887 --> 02:48:49.389]  Uh uh.
[02:48:50.449 --> 02:48:51.950]  That's not my goal in life.
[02:48:53.191 --> 02:48:54.492]  I'm not talking about that.
[02:48:55.613 --> 02:49:02.417]  I'm talking about the fact that we keep the energy avenues open that we have now.
[02:49:04.048 --> 02:49:14.012]  And we actually let in the door the suppressed technologies, which by now would have obviated our need for oil.
[02:49:14.652 --> 02:49:18.493]  It would have been done as it was supposed to be done, you see.
[02:49:18.933 --> 02:49:27.436]  It's not depopulate the planet, let's go back to living in trees and let the few barons of the estate run the entire Earth.
[02:49:27.836 --> 02:49:29.037]  That's not the picture.
[02:49:30.273 --> 02:49:33.435]  That was never a sane picture for anybody.
[02:49:33.895 --> 02:49:39.517]  Only the lunatics running the asylum thought that was a good idea and still think it is.
[02:49:40.358 --> 02:49:40.638]  No.
[02:49:41.598 --> 02:49:51.463]  In the natural scheme of things, by the early part of the 20th century, oil would have started to be overtaken.
[02:49:52.323 --> 02:49:53.084]  It would have happened.
[02:49:53.982 --> 02:50:05.254]  And the technologies that Tesla and others developed would have by now overtaken oil and we would be living in a different world where every human would have access to energy.
[02:50:06.896 --> 02:50:16.686]  Every human minus nobody would have access to all the energy they need.
[02:50:18.553 --> 02:50:23.296]  If these technologies had not been suppressed, no question about it.
[02:50:24.256 --> 02:50:26.138]  Ditto for the field of healing.
[02:50:27.999 --> 02:50:38.545]  By now, we would have seen incredible breakthrough healing of the entire range of human disease.
[02:50:40.666 --> 02:50:45.309]  If technologies had been allowed to develop, that's all we needed.
[02:50:47.422 --> 02:50:48.804]  Okay, we're coming to a break here.
[02:50:48.844 --> 02:50:53.330]  This is John Rappaport sitting in for Alex Jones on InfoWars Radio.
[02:50:53.730 --> 02:51:01.060]  And don't forget to go to InfoWarsLife.com to see about some breakthrough new health products.
[02:51:09.650 --> 02:51:12.211]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:51:12.471 --> 02:51:17.334]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:51:17.594 --> 02:51:25.479]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:51:25.719 --> 02:51:30.022]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:51:30.242 --> 02:51:34.044]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.

[02:51:40.149 --> 02:51:42.931]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:51:43.331 --> 02:51:48.535]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from MyPatriotSupply.

[02:53:08.869 --> 02:53:12.311]  It's been said, those who control the food, control the people.
[02:53:12.531 --> 02:53:16.234]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[02:53:16.334 --> 02:53:22.278]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[02:53:22.538 --> 02:53:32.604]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods, and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system, which accounts for 80% of your immune system.

[02:54:00.585 --> 02:54:06.870]  We're here sitting in for Alex Jones on our last segment, talking about energy, energy suppression,
[02:54:29.420 --> 02:54:42.243]  I was reminded that, take these names down, Nick Gonzales, doctor in New York, Stan Brzezinski, doctor in Houston, Dr. Joseph Gold in New York State.
[02:54:43.303 --> 02:54:48.164]  Three breakthrough technologies, medical technologies.
[02:54:49.484 --> 02:54:52.465]  And I don't mean by that, oh this cures everybody all the time.
[02:54:52.525 --> 02:54:53.645]  People sometimes write to me.
[02:54:54.346 --> 02:54:56.847]  What do they think I am, some kind of a complete rube?
[02:54:57.367 --> 02:55:01.549]  Take this and everybody in the world will be cured all the time.
[02:55:02.849 --> 02:55:03.210]  Hold on.
[02:55:04.210 --> 02:55:07.831]  What these doctors were saying is very promising.
[02:55:08.212 --> 02:55:08.752]  It works.
[02:55:09.512 --> 02:55:10.472]  We've seen it work.
[02:55:11.413 --> 02:55:15.575]  We want to study it further because we know it can be applied to more people.
[02:55:16.735 --> 02:55:18.456]  It's been shown to work.
[02:55:21.157 --> 02:55:23.538]  With gold, it was hydrazine sulfate.
[02:55:24.551 --> 02:55:25.511]  for cancer patients.
[02:55:26.632 --> 02:55:31.694]  Nick Gonzalez in New York, an enzyme and nutritional protocol for cancer.
[02:55:32.454 --> 02:55:37.056]  Stan Brzezinski in Houston, neoplastins, a protocol for cancer.
[02:55:38.356 --> 02:55:39.537]  And here's the kicker, folks.
[02:55:40.177 --> 02:55:46.780]  Eventually, all these three were studied by the official domain of medical science.
[02:55:46.840 --> 02:55:50.161]  In other words, clinical trial with volunteers.
[02:55:51.787 --> 02:55:54.348]  Forced into it by pressure and pressure.
[02:55:54.449 --> 02:55:55.509]  All right, we'll look at it.
[02:55:55.569 --> 02:55:56.250]  We'll look at it.
[02:55:56.770 --> 02:56:04.194]  And then every single one of those clinical trials in all these cases were perverted and twisted.
[02:56:04.634 --> 02:56:11.478]  The protocols were changed to produce a negative and disastrous outcome.
[02:56:13.018 --> 02:56:14.439]  That's what we're dealing with here.
[02:56:15.079 --> 02:56:15.639]  Murderers.
[02:56:16.299 --> 02:56:17.380]  That's what we're dealing with.
[02:56:17.960 --> 02:56:27.543]  People who murder in order to protect, in this case, a monopoly of the toxic drug pharmaceutical complex and cartel.
[02:56:29.184 --> 02:56:32.625]  But the difference between sickness and health is all about energy.
[02:56:33.845 --> 02:56:38.427]  The difference between a society of scarcity and abundance is all about energy.
[02:56:39.447 --> 02:56:41.668]  And if you want to talk about free energy,
[02:56:42.543 --> 02:56:47.799]  What it really means is not just energy out of nowhere.
[02:56:49.025 --> 02:56:56.868]  It means actual energy delivered for free or for pennies to everybody on the planet.
[02:56:56.908 --> 02:56:57.989]  Yes, it can be sold.
[02:56:58.229 --> 02:56:59.329]  Of course it can be sold.
[02:56:59.669 --> 02:57:02.330]  It doesn't have to be sold at any kind of a high price.
[02:57:02.770 --> 02:57:12.294]  It can be sold for pennies to everybody, in which case, whoever is producing this technology, however many companies, are all making a nice profit.
[02:57:12.654 --> 02:57:13.655]  Nobody's suffering.
[02:57:13.815 --> 02:57:16.836]  Everybody's having an abundance of energy.
[02:57:18.462 --> 02:57:25.498]  We have to liberate this fact about where the world is now.
[02:57:27.628 --> 02:57:37.851]  We have to liberate these technologies and more technologies that will give us the abundance that we need in terms of human energy and the energy to run civilization.
[02:57:38.872 --> 02:57:40.012]  That's the agenda.
[02:57:40.312 --> 02:57:50.255]  That's the agenda that the elites are trying to destroy and distract us from with all of this other insanity that goes on day by day by day by day.
[02:57:51.756 --> 02:57:54.837]  That's why wars are created at the highest level.
[02:57:56.650 --> 02:58:04.154]  Control the monopoly, control the one basic form of energy that we have, the big lie.
[02:58:05.614 --> 02:58:12.237]  Distract everybody, give them all kinds of high-flying idealistic reasons for war and destroying each other.
[02:58:12.798 --> 02:58:15.539]  Oh yes, we have to do it in the name of this and that and the other thing.
[02:58:15.599 --> 02:58:21.722]  No, all you have to do is turn your attention to the suppressed technologies.
[02:58:23.055 --> 02:58:24.615]  Thanks so much, folks, for tuning in.
[02:58:24.655 --> 02:58:28.436]  John Rappaport sitting in for Alex Jones, InfoWars Radio.
