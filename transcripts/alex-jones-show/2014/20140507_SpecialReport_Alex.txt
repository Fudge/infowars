[00:00:08.322 --> 00:00:15.067]  The news is plagued with headlines warning that deadly superbugs that evade antibiotics is spreading globally.
[00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:24.173]  The World Health Organization is calling for urgent action to preserve the power of antibiotics as the effects of drug resistance will be devastating.
[00:00:24.573 --> 00:00:32.139]  Something as simple as a scratch or a UTI could kill and once beaten diseases could resurface as fatal illnesses.
[00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:40.224]  According to a new report from the World Health Organization, antibiotic resistance is now a bigger crisis than the AIDS epidemic.
[00:00:40.744 --> 00:00:45.707]  One of the best-known superbugs, MRSA, is estimated to kill around 19,000 people in the US annually.
[00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:48.430]  I think?
[00:01:05.612 --> 00:01:12.458]  Last year, a mystery flu-like illness killed dozens of people in Texas, including family members of Alex Jones.
[00:01:13.038 --> 00:01:22.085]  The cause of illness has yet to be diagnosed, but doctors are certain it's not H1N1, but they say perhaps it could be a new form of the disease.
[00:01:22.546 --> 00:01:27.630]  But while there's the threat of a post-antibiotic era and new drug-resistant diseases are imminent,
[00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.455]  Why is the government reconstituting deadly viruses?
[00:01:31.815 --> 00:01:36.641]  Earlier this year, researchers reconstructed the DNA of the first-ever bubonic plague.
[00:01:36.962 --> 00:01:44.471]  The researcher hasn't ruled out the possibility for potentially dangerous mutations and warned there could be new outbreaks.
[00:01:45.032 --> 00:01:56.800]  Researchers reconstituted the 1918 Spanish flu, perhaps the most lethal plague in the history of humankind, to help prevent a calamity, they hoped, and not cause one.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:09.368]  Scientists experiment with these potentially deadly viruses in order to develop new vaccines and treatments, but sometimes those strains and their mutations might not stay safely inside the lab.
[00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.971]  Last month, a Maximum Research Facility lab in Texas
[00:02:13.191 --> 00:02:13.711]  We're good.
[00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:36.912]  A French lab reported it lost more than 2,000 vials containing fragments of the deadly SARS virus.
[00:02:37.312 --> 00:02:40.396]  How can it be that easy to misplace a bioweapon?
[00:02:40.756 --> 00:02:49.786]  And even more curious, the genetic code for these agents is uploaded into public databases so other researchers can download them to conduct experiments.
[00:02:50.387 --> 00:02:54.229]  How easy would it be for a bioterrorist to exploit that information?
[00:02:54.689 --> 00:03:02.674]  As headlines are flooded with the warnings of a post-antibiotic era, drug makers have said they will no longer produce antibiotics.
[00:03:03.294 --> 00:03:08.537]  No doubt this will drive up the cost of existing antibiotics, but what else is behind this?
[00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:11.658]  Is it a push to get people to buy more medical insurance?
[00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:14.120]  Or is it something more sinister?
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.564]  Like leaving the entire population helpless to a superbug or a weaponized bacterial outbreak.
[00:03:21.025 --> 00:03:24.947]  Outbreaks like the Ebola virus that is currently spreading throughout Africa.
[00:03:25.428 --> 00:03:39.998]  In April, a mob in Guinea descended upon an Ebola treatment clinic, accusing Doctors Without Borders health workers of bringing the Ebola virus with them to Guinea, where there had never previously been any cases of the virus.
[00:03:40.638 --> 00:03:41.199]  I don't know.
[00:03:55.757 --> 00:04:07.641]  FEMA is advertising for contractors who can supply medical biohazard disposal capabilities, 40-yard dumpsters, and medical supplies to go with 1,000 tent hospitals set up across the United States.
[00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:13.862]  The emergency rollout of these services must be able to be completed within 24 to 48 hours.
[00:04:14.043 --> 00:04:22.965]  These large-scale purchases indicate that FEMA is not just making routine emergency preparations, but instead gearing up for a major crisis.
[00:04:23.445 --> 00:04:24.466]  They're getting prepared.
[00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:25.246]  Are you?
[00:04:31.872 --> 00:04:37.277]  Friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:04:37.498 --> 00:04:44.725]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:48.088]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:04:48.188 --> 00:04:49.970]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.855]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with Nascent Iodine.
