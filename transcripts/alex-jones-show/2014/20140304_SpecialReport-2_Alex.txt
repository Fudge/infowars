[00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:06.394]  Just for your information, it is a criminal offense to disrupt a public meeting.
[00:00:06.414 --> 00:00:11.498]  If you persist in that kind of behavior, you can potentially be charged with that.
[00:00:11.998 --> 00:00:14.280]  I wanted to let you know that.
[00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:16.562]  And we'll go on with our discussion.
[00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:17.783]  There's a motion on the table.
[00:00:18.944 --> 00:00:28.071]  I want to say, following Councilmember Spellman's, we have listened to evidence on this subject for several years.
[00:00:29.238 --> 00:00:29.858]  Several years.
[00:00:30.959 --> 00:00:32.099]  Five, I'll accept five.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:41.742]  We have gone to the trouble to send this item to a council committee and receive testimony from our health department here at the city.
[00:00:42.382 --> 00:00:43.803]  We've heard from other experts.
[00:00:43.963 --> 00:00:48.144]  I even asked my dentist and his answer was unequivocal.
[00:00:48.244 --> 00:00:54.086]  Yes, fluoride in the water at safe levels is something that we should continue to do.
[00:00:54.727 --> 00:00:57.808]  So I've heard no scientific evidence to the contrary.
[00:00:57.868 --> 00:00:58.788]  I'll support the motion.
[00:00:59.415 --> 00:01:07.662]  Once again, City Council had no qualms about issuing another four-year round of toxic chemicals into the Austin, Texas water supply.
[00:01:08.162 --> 00:01:10.764]  Hydrofluoric acid has shown to have those symptoms.
[00:01:11.385 --> 00:01:12.025]  Arthritis.
[00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:13.987]  I'm 23 years old.
[00:01:14.067 --> 00:01:15.828]  I shouldn't have signs of arthritis.
[00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:22.654]  It's corrosive to the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes through direct contact, inhalation, or ingestion.
[00:01:23.174 --> 00:01:26.477]  Dr. Philip Grandjean at the Harvard School of Public Health.
[00:01:27.137 --> 00:01:47.413]  And Dr. Phillip Landergan, a pediatrician at the Mount Sinai Medical School in New York City, commented, the developing human brain is uniquely vulnerable to toxic chemical exposures and major windows of developmental vulnerability occur in utero and during infancy and early childhood.
[00:01:47.754 --> 00:01:51.657]  The fetus is not well protected against industrial chemicals.
[00:01:52.217 --> 00:01:55.240]  The placenta does not block the passage of environmental
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:04.064]  Toxicants from the maternal to the fetal circulation and more than 200 foreign chemicals have been detected in umbilical cord blood.
[00:02:05.145 --> 00:02:20.392]  They conclude disorders of neurobehavioral development affect 10 to 15% of all births and prevalence of autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit disorder seem to be increasing worldwide.
[00:02:20.712 --> 00:02:21.492]  We're telling you the truth.
[00:02:21.592 --> 00:02:23.793]  It's not like those facts are made up.
[00:02:23.853 --> 00:02:25.154]  It's like this is a toxic chemical.
[00:02:25.354 --> 00:02:28.515]  It's not necessary in our water and we're spending two million dollars on this.
[00:02:28.635 --> 00:02:32.277]  Having fluoride in the water, all the research I've done, it's not good for us.
[00:02:32.657 --> 00:02:43.121]  Regardless of those voices that were cut in half by Mayor Lee Leffingwell in violation of Articles 2527 and 2529 of the Austin City Code.
[00:02:43.902 --> 00:02:47.403]  It's within our authority to limit testimony to any amount
[00:02:49.949 --> 00:03:02.954]  A unanimous vote awarded Florida-based Mosaic LLC up to $2,290,900 of taxpayer dollars to essentially poison themselves.
[00:03:05.775 --> 00:03:07.716]  I need to speak to somebody about fluoride.
[00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:12.158]  Should I be concerned about my child or myself swallowing this?
[00:03:13.934 --> 00:03:18.117]  If they get more than a mouthful, you know, I would want you to call us.
[00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:25.724]  Otherwise, normally we just recommend have, you know, chew up some Tums or drink a glass of milk because that helps bind up the fluoride.
[00:03:26.004 --> 00:03:26.284]  Okay.
[00:03:26.324 --> 00:03:35.451]  I also read that the Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, allows this amount in a single glass of drinking water.
[00:03:35.692 --> 00:03:39.555]  If my kid drinks more than one glass of water per day, should I call you?
[00:03:40.774 --> 00:03:41.855]  I wouldn't expect so, no.
[00:03:41.995 --> 00:03:43.636]  I was going to say, I'm not sure.
[00:03:43.937 --> 00:03:45.078]  Doesn't that make sense, though?
[00:03:45.518 --> 00:03:46.959]  Yeah, no, I understand.
[00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:48.500]  Your logic is perfectly, yeah.
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.202]  I mean, it makes complete sense to me.
[00:03:50.722 --> 00:03:55.186]  The council members are not ignorant of the consequences of water fluoridation.
[00:03:55.466 --> 00:04:05.854]  Back in 2011, fluoridation expert Dr. Paul Conant and dentist Dr. E. Griffin Cole presented fact after indisputable fact to the council.
[00:04:06.355 --> 00:04:07.856]  They cited a review in 1993, and as you've already seen,
[00:04:10.868 --> 00:04:11.288]  That's good.
[00:04:26.127 --> 00:04:29.130]  In nearly every country, whether it was fluoridated or not.
[00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.395]  But in the end, the love affair with the aluminum and phosphate mining industries won the day.
[00:04:35.955 --> 00:04:47.545]  Since 1945, 69 years later, fluoride, a topical medication, continues to be ingested by the majority of the United States of America.
