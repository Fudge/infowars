[00:00:19.178 --> 00:00:20.699]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.799 --> 00:00:21.399]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:22.320]  It's Tuesday, August 26, 2014.
[00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.541]  And here are our top stories.
[00:00:27.983 --> 00:00:32.805]  Tonight, the push for national ID cards is on.
[00:00:33.846 --> 00:00:37.928]  Then, a white Marine falls victim to a black hate crime.
[00:00:38.708 --> 00:00:42.490]  And a Utah rep questions the use of militarized police.
[00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:46.693]  That's next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:48.771 --> 00:01:02.561]  Well, not a day goes by that we're not being prepared for the executive amnesty of Obama.
[00:01:02.861 --> 00:01:14.870]  Today, we see Illinois Democrat Louise Gutierrez, who, if you remember, just recently went before La Raza, the racist group The Race, and said, we are going to stop the deportation of our people.
[00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:23.295]  Now he's saying that it's music to his ears, that someone would have a source at the White House that say that it's 5 million people that are going to be given amnesty.
[00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:28.018]  He said, let me say tomorrow, the next day, and all of this week, we're getting ready.
[00:01:28.598 --> 00:01:30.059]  Well, how is he getting ready?
[00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:33.081]  He says, so I've been going around meeting with other
[00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:39.346]  With major news organizations, newspaper editorial boards, columnists and others here in Chicago.
[00:01:39.386 --> 00:01:43.509]  In other words, he's meeting with people that are going to shape public opinion.
[00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.994]  He's meeting with people who are going to propagandize the public and spin this in the way that they want to spin it.
[00:01:49.574 --> 00:01:56.199]  He said, together with all these news organizations and editorial boards and columnists, he said, we're going to prepare a model for the nation.
[00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:04.685]  Because when five million people are allowed the opportunity to come out from under the shadows, come out from under the shadows, what are they doing in the shadows?
[00:02:05.106 --> 00:02:07.388]  And into the light of day and get legalized.
[00:02:07.428 --> 00:02:08.689]  Hey, I thought they were...
[00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:10.170]  Undocumented.
[00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.472]  I didn't think they were illegals.
[00:02:11.712 --> 00:02:13.955]  He's admitting that what they're doing is illegal.
[00:02:14.456 --> 00:02:21.225]  Now they also were saying that they expect Obama to make a move next week after he returns from Estonia and Wales.
[00:02:22.082 --> 00:02:28.824]  Now, the Mexican president is visiting America, and he's lecturing us on what we should do with our immigration laws.
[00:02:28.864 --> 00:02:35.065]  He was visiting Jerry Brown in California, and this is part of a two-day trip through California.
[00:02:35.105 --> 00:02:38.506]  They say, in Politico, to immigrant-friendly California.
[00:02:38.906 --> 00:02:44.388]  And of course, Jerry Brown is going out of his way to be friendly to the president and to illegal immigrants.
[00:02:44.408 --> 00:02:46.048]  He says, it wasn't very long ago.
[00:02:46.348 --> 00:02:55.233]  This is Jerry Brown talking, governor of California, that the governor of California was outlawing driver's licenses for people who were undocumented from Mexico.
[00:02:55.913 --> 00:02:57.594]  That's not the law anymore, he brags.
[00:02:58.014 --> 00:02:59.075]  Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:02:59.835 --> 00:03:14.503]  Undocumented people were not getting licenses, but now we're going to give people that don't have any documents, that don't have any legal basis for a driver's license issued by the state of California, if they're Mexican citizens, let them get a Mexican driver's license.
[00:03:15.063 --> 00:03:18.267]  And Jerry Brown has the audacity to say that that's not the law anymore.
[00:03:18.287 --> 00:03:20.129]  Why does he care what the law is?
[00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.051]  He just looks the other way.
[00:03:22.492 --> 00:03:26.797]  Now, he signed a bill last year that will enable immigrants to get driver's licenses.
[00:03:27.277 --> 00:03:30.461]  And California voters, they note in Politico, voted in 1994 in Proposition 187
[00:03:33.044 --> 00:03:39.828]  That immigrants who are in this country illegally would not get social services, things like health care or education.
[00:03:40.228 --> 00:03:53.356]  But of course, that was overthrown by our own courts, because our politicians, our courts, are going to ram through the North American Union and the welfare state, the Cloward and Piven strategy, regardless of what Americans want.
[00:03:54.383 --> 00:03:58.646]  Politico points out that Hispanics have now become a force to be reckoned with in California.
[00:03:58.686 --> 00:04:06.130]  They now make up the largest of any racial or ethnic group in the state, though their voter registration numbers still lag behind whites.
[00:04:06.351 --> 00:04:07.631]  Well, they're going to take care of that.
[00:04:08.052 --> 00:04:14.596]  They're going to grant them amnesty, they're going to give them driver's licenses, and they're going to let them vote because that's what this is really about.
[00:04:14.756 --> 00:04:19.299]  It's about selecting the voters that are going to keep them in office and give them carte blanche
[00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:20.659]  For a socialist state.
[00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:29.041]  Now this is what the Mexican president said as he lectured us on how we should allow people who are flaunting our laws to stay here.
[00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:33.082]  He says there are still states that have not evolved as much as California.
[00:04:33.422 --> 00:04:35.103]  That still skimp on recognition.
[00:04:35.483 --> 00:04:38.083]  And even worse, on the rights of immigrants.
[00:04:38.603 --> 00:04:40.624]  The rights of illegal immigrants.
[00:04:41.164 --> 00:04:52.508]  He said, those who still believe and bet for the exclusion and the discrimination and the rejection of diversity, I only have one thing to say, the future, and a very near future, will demonstrate your ethical mistakes.
[00:04:52.989 --> 00:04:59.551]  So he spends this as exclusion, as discrimination, as a rejection of diversity.
[00:04:59.931 --> 00:05:04.433]  No, it's actually standing for the legal process that immigrants have traditionally gone through.
[00:05:04.853 --> 00:05:07.654]  It's actually standing for some control over our country.
[00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:17.818]  Some control over the number of people that are going to be brought in to see if they have the means, as every other country in the world requires the means of their own support, to support their own family.
[00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:27.882]  But as they give driver's licenses to illegal aliens in California, American citizens are going to get national ID cards.
[00:05:27.922 --> 00:05:29.783]  This is a story from the Ron Paul forums.
[00:05:29.843 --> 00:05:31.423]  It's picked up on Infowars.com today.
[00:05:31.503 --> 00:05:32.364]  Propaganda alert!
[00:05:32.924 --> 00:05:37.957]  Without a national ID card, you may be banned from boarding airplanes as soon as 2016.
[00:05:38.197 --> 00:05:41.886]  Now this is a case of a woman who is from Massachusetts.
[00:05:42.833 --> 00:05:50.176]  She was not allowed to enter a federal building in Washington this month because she only had a Massachusetts driver's license.
[00:05:50.536 --> 00:05:55.979]  And they're one of only nine states that have not signed on to a new federal law called Real ID.
[00:05:56.579 --> 00:06:04.782]  And they point out in this article that if nothing changes, those people in those nine states will even lose the ability to display their licenses in order to board a plane.
[00:06:05.162 --> 00:06:08.724]  See, if she had something from the Border Patrol that was a permiso,
[00:06:09.204 --> 00:06:12.287]  Or if she had identification from the Mexican Embassy, that would be fine.
[00:06:12.607 --> 00:06:13.708]  She could get on a plane with that.
[00:06:13.728 --> 00:06:16.091]  She could probably go into federal buildings with no problem whatsoever.
[00:06:16.451 --> 00:06:21.796]  But she only has a driver's license from Massachusetts as an American citizen.
[00:06:22.177 --> 00:06:23.077]  That's not good enough.
[00:06:23.418 --> 00:06:33.387]  Now they point out that Massachusetts and other places have refused to enact REAL ID because it costs them millions of dollars and those states are concerned about privacy.
[00:06:34.028 --> 00:06:34.488]  That's right.
[00:06:34.848 --> 00:06:35.349]  So are we.
[00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:46.114]  Now they say that unless they adopt it, of course, they will soon find themselves banned even from White House tours next year and from commercial airplanes as soon as 2016.
[00:06:47.275 --> 00:06:50.196]  But who needs a stinking driver's license anyway?
[00:06:50.797 --> 00:06:52.578]  We're not going to be driving cars.
[00:06:52.898 --> 00:06:54.599]  The cars are going to be driving themselves.
[00:06:55.461 --> 00:07:09.929]  In another piece of news that we see coming out with increasing frequency, and of course this is a story from the Washington Post, it's picked up on Drudge again, there's every day, there's more stories about driverless cars, about autonomous cars as they point out in this particular article.
[00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:15.332]  No, I think actually right now, you are autonomous, you are self-driving, not your car.
[00:07:15.372 --> 00:07:20.835]  These are robotic cars that are going to be driven by computers and they are going to be controlled by the government.
[00:07:21.095 --> 00:07:27.499]  Now, in this particular case, the Washington Post reporter is driving around with someone who is going through the busy streets of Washington, D.C.
[00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:32.081]  And they said, many people don't really think that this is going to happen that soon.
[00:07:32.161 --> 00:07:41.307]  She said, swing a stick on the mall this summer and you'll hit a dozen skeptics who doubt that the streets of Washington, or any city for that matter, will ever be filled with cars that drive themselves.
[00:07:41.367 --> 00:07:48.411]  But the doubters may well witness that transformation in their lifetime, very likely sooner than they think.
[00:07:49.051 --> 00:07:57.374]  Now, before we talk about the time frame that they put in this article at the very end of it, she pointed out something that I think we ought to all step back and look at.
[00:07:57.394 --> 00:08:07.977]  She says, if this car, a silver gray Cadillac SUV that's converted to autonomous driving, if this car looked the least bit odd, she says, the Capitol Police would swarm after it with their machine guns.
[00:08:08.357 --> 00:08:08.798]  That's right.
[00:08:09.118 --> 00:08:17.369]  And in this paranoid police state that we now live in, do we really want to give total control, yeah, of our transportation to the government?
[00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:24.579]  So that they will not only know everywhere we go, but be able to stop, divert, control our cars in any way that they wish to.
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:30.445]  Now, this is the time frame that these people are talking about, the person that took her around from Carnegie Mellon Institute.
[00:08:30.785 --> 00:08:41.876]  He said within the next three to five years, there'll be a highway pilot feature, for example, that'll allow you to get on the interstate and just drive from one city to the other and it will take care of doing the interstate driving.
[00:08:42.356 --> 00:08:47.700]  After that, shortly, they will have the ability to start switching lanes and driving faster.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.723]  Then, after that, in another three to four years, look for traffic jam assistance capability.
[00:08:53.083 --> 00:09:00.028]  The car will take over you while inching through bumper-to-bumper traffic and alert you to take back control once it's clear sailing.
[00:09:00.549 --> 00:09:03.991]  No, actually, eventually, you're not going to have a steering wheel.
[00:09:04.011 --> 00:09:05.612]  You're not going to have brakes in your car.
[00:09:05.632 --> 00:09:07.113]  It's just going to be the computer driving it.
[00:09:07.493 --> 00:09:09.575]  But this is what he had to say that I thought was interesting.
[00:09:09.955 --> 00:09:13.278]  He said, the totally driverless version will happen sometime in the 2020s.
[00:09:13.338 --> 00:09:15.761]  Most people believe it'll be the very early 2020s.
[00:09:16.221 --> 00:09:19.064]  He said, the whole process will be incremental.
[00:09:19.585 --> 00:09:21.587]  Isn't that the way we always lose our freedoms?
[00:09:21.887 --> 00:09:30.155]  He said, more and more scenarios that we drive in will become automated, and one fine day, you've given up complete control, but you don't even notice.
[00:09:30.776 --> 00:09:31.136]  That's right.
[00:09:31.897 --> 00:09:41.805]  Former Senator Alan Simpson said that the loss of freedom isn't a slippery slope, it's going down a staircase that's ever-descending into tyranny.
[00:09:43.376 --> 00:09:49.383]  Now, people are going to be driven away from their cars with fines and with fees from the police.
[00:09:49.423 --> 00:09:51.025]  That's one of the techniques that they're going to use.
[00:09:51.485 --> 00:10:00.376]  But right now, we're seeing in many of the police departments that are out of control, we're seeing that they're doing the very same thing with their fees.
[00:10:00.416 --> 00:10:02.738]  Look at what's happening in Ferguson, Missouri, of course.
[00:10:03.379 --> 00:10:09.445]  This is from Governing.com and they say skyrocketing court fines are major revenue generators for Ferguson.
[00:10:09.886 --> 00:10:19.836]  Some say that Ferguson's increasing reliance on court fines to fund its municipal operations may have contributed to its residents' distrust in law enforcement and government.
[00:10:20.416 --> 00:10:22.278]  Well, I think it's also an indicator.
[00:10:22.319 --> 00:10:30.969]  Whenever the government views its citizens as cattle to be milked, it's not very long before we start seeing corruption and excessive force following.
[00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.372]  But look at what happened in Ferguson, for example.
[00:10:33.773 --> 00:10:38.759]  They point out that court fines now account for one-fifth of the total operating revenue of the city.
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.421]  One-fifth of their revenue.
[00:10:40.802 --> 00:10:41.102]  The St.
[00:10:41.122 --> 00:10:51.655]  Louis suburb of only about 21,000 residents took in more than $2.5 million in municipal court revenue last fiscal year, representing an 80% increase from just two years prior.
[00:10:51.975 --> 00:10:55.340]  Now take a look at this graph that's on this article right here at the bottom.
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.282]  You can see that it's kind of going along.
[00:10:57.322 --> 00:10:58.043]  There it is right there.
[00:10:58.163 --> 00:11:01.207]  And in just the last couple of years, it's skyrocketed.
[00:11:01.627 --> 00:11:03.690]  Now this is what an assistant professor to St.
[00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.212]  Louis University School of Law said.
[00:11:05.232 --> 00:11:09.317]  He described the court system in Ferguson and in certain areas of St.
[00:11:09.357 --> 00:11:09.617]  Louis.
[00:11:09.857 --> 00:11:12.380]  He said they function primarily as a revenue generator.
[00:11:13.021 --> 00:11:17.384]  They don't want to actually incarcerate people because it costs more money, so they fine him, he said.
[00:11:17.924 --> 00:11:20.186]  It appears to be a blatant money grab.
[00:11:20.786 --> 00:11:22.867]  Does that resemble the town that you live in?
[00:11:23.047 --> 00:11:24.508]  I've lived in many towns like that.
[00:11:24.889 --> 00:11:26.389]  It's a pattern of behavior.
[00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:31.433]  And of course, you're going to see them treating people with no respect when they rob you on the highway.
[00:11:31.453 --> 00:11:37.737]  He says, from his time representing clients in Ferguson, he estimates that the court, which holds three sessions each month, heard 200 to 300 cases
[00:11:39.898 --> 00:11:41.727]  Per hour on some days.
[00:11:42.129 --> 00:11:42.591]  That's right.
[00:11:42.691 --> 00:11:44.258]  It's just a revenue stream.
[00:11:45.356 --> 00:11:55.622]  Now we have a congressman who is talking about demilitarizing the police, and it really underscores that this is a federal problem as much as it is a local problem.
[00:11:55.662 --> 00:11:57.143]  It's being driven by the feds.
[00:11:57.664 --> 00:12:05.909]  This is Representative Stewart, and he is seeking, according to the Deseret News in Salt Lake City, Utah, he is seeking to introduce a bill.
[00:12:06.449 --> 00:12:10.632]  The bill is the Regulatory Agency Demilitarization Act.
[00:12:11.112 --> 00:12:17.155]  He says it's a response to SWAT-style teams at various federal agencies, including the Bureau of Land Management.
[00:12:17.175 --> 00:12:26.179]  And he says this all started back with the Bundy standoff, when he realized that you have all these various agencies that essentially have their own SWAT teams.
[00:12:26.439 --> 00:12:35.204]  He says, I don't feel comfortable now in the wake of Ferguson taking advantage of that and trying to sell it by saying, look what's happening out in Ferguson, therefore come and support my bill.
[00:12:36.084 --> 00:12:44.148]  This, I think, underscores the fact that it is not just an urban issue, it's not a rural issue, like people were saying in the Bundy Ranch.
[00:12:44.188 --> 00:12:52.492]  It wasn't a case of what was happening there, so much as with the laws, with the federal ownership of the land, yes, that was an issue.
[00:12:53.132 --> 00:13:01.015]  But the real issue was the militarization of the police, the militarization of these regulatory agencies, the way they were treating people there.
[00:13:01.375 --> 00:13:06.056]  And in the same way, when you look at the urban environment, it's the issue of the way they're treating people.
[00:13:06.096 --> 00:13:08.037]  It's not just an urban or rural issue.
[00:13:08.357 --> 00:13:10.017]  It's not a white or a black issue.
[00:13:10.417 --> 00:13:14.879]  This is a national issue because it's being driven by the federal government.
[00:13:15.319 --> 00:13:22.224]  Now he says that he introduced this bill following the standoff between heavily armed BLM agents and Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy and his supporters.
[00:13:22.264 --> 00:13:32.910]  He said, there is no reason, I don't think, that the Department of Education, the IRS, the FDA, or you know, pick a regulatory agency, needs what is essentially a SWAT team.
[00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:42.497]  Now his bill will prohibit federal agencies who are not traditionally involved in law enforcement from purchasing machine guns, grenades, and similar weapons
[00:13:43.197 --> 00:13:48.639]  This is authority that was granted to them, of course, by the Homeland Security Act.
[00:13:49.179 --> 00:13:56.362]  Yes, the Homeland Security Act of 2002, that fundamentally transformed America, and not for the better.
[00:13:57.002 --> 00:14:07.626]  The Department of Education has already used a SWAT team to point loaded guns in the face of a family and drag them out on the front lawn, face down, because of a delinquent student loan.
[00:14:08.226 --> 00:14:10.587]  That's America, thanks to Homeland Security.
[00:14:10.827 --> 00:14:13.647]  Hopefully, he'll have some effect and get that turned back.
[00:14:14.508 --> 00:14:22.530]  Now, in more news from Ferguson and the police state, we see a white Marine beaten by a black mob in Michael Brown's revenge attack.
[00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:27.111]  Now, this incident actually took place in Mississippi, not in Missouri.
[00:14:27.731 --> 00:14:40.016]  I had a couple of white men who were told that they needed to leave the Waffle House because there was a group of black men upset about the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and that the restaurant wasn't a safe place for whites.
[00:14:40.616 --> 00:14:47.859]  Now, they left, and they were followed by a group of 20 men, and when one of them came out of the restroom, he found that the other guy was being attacked.
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:53.322]  This fellow, David Knighton, who is a veteran from the Air Force, served in Afghanistan.
[00:14:53.962 --> 00:14:54.582]  He was attacked.
[00:14:54.702 --> 00:14:59.585]  Also, he suffered broken bones in his face, a blood clot in his right eye, and a cut over his left eye.
[00:14:59.665 --> 00:15:02.886]  The other fellow has now been hospitalized with an induced coma.
[00:15:03.346 --> 00:15:04.527]  But this is what happened.
[00:15:04.547 --> 00:15:08.909]  The police were called to the scene about 2 a.m., which is about an hour after this all started.
[00:15:09.469 --> 00:15:20.234]  But the mob had already left, and despite the context of the argument and the yelling of racial slurs, the police chief, Tim Brinkley, said the incident wasn't being treated as a hate crime.
[00:15:20.914 --> 00:15:29.618]  Of course, we've seen a lot of pushing of racial stereotypes, trying to push a division between white and black, and also against the police in Ferguson.
[00:15:30.078 --> 00:15:41.024]  We've seen that with people like Al Sharpton coming in, but we also saw that with Dan Page, the officer who supposedly pushed Don Lemon of CNN and was subsequently suspended or fired.
[00:15:41.444 --> 00:15:47.947]  We're going to have a report on that tomorrow because there's a lot of interesting background on this fellow who's presenting himself
[00:15:48.547 --> 00:15:53.069]  Not only as a police officer, but as a very high-ranking military official.
[00:15:53.229 --> 00:15:54.510]  Is this part of a PSYOP?
[00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.070]  We'll have that report tomorrow.
[00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:06.495]  Coming up after the break, we have a report from Leanne McAdoo and John Bowne, who are in San Francisco getting a resident's take on the aftermath of the earthquake and how the government is handling it.
[00:16:06.575 --> 00:16:07.015]  Stay with us.
[00:16:08.832 --> 00:16:12.634]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[00:16:13.054 --> 00:16:14.234]  I can like taste dirt in it.
[00:16:14.314 --> 00:16:15.435]  God knows what's in this.
[00:16:15.595 --> 00:16:16.576]  This has an aftertaste.
[00:16:16.616 --> 00:16:18.196]  Tastes like Austin water?
[00:16:18.457 --> 00:16:19.297]  Yeah, it does.
[00:16:19.377 --> 00:16:23.519]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[00:16:23.779 --> 00:16:29.882]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered for the ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[00:16:29.982 --> 00:16:30.783]  High quality H2O.
[00:16:31.383 --> 00:16:32.424]  That one is better.
[00:16:32.464 --> 00:16:33.444]  Tastes like nothing.
[00:16:33.724 --> 00:16:35.145]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[00:16:35.165 --> 00:16:35.725]  It's good water.
[00:16:35.805 --> 00:16:44.348]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, Monsanto's deadly pesticide, glyphosate, and many others.
[00:16:44.749 --> 00:16:52.252]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lower IQ, and even cancer.
[00:16:52.532 --> 00:16:55.033]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[00:16:55.673 --> 00:16:57.954]  It has that processed flavor to it.
[00:16:58.294 --> 00:17:07.877]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances and many more, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[00:17:07.897 --> 00:17:09.618]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[00:17:09.698 --> 00:17:10.378]  It's good water.
[00:17:11.047 --> 00:17:11.507]  Refreshing.
[00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:12.288]  It's good.

[00:18:08.835 --> 00:18:15.485]  24 hours after a devastating earthquake rocked Napa Valley, California, locals are picking up the pieces.
[00:18:16.186 --> 00:18:19.271]  The 6.0 magnitude earthquake left more than 100 injured.
[00:18:20.287 --> 00:18:29.710]  Homes were shaken from their foundations, and potentially more than a billion dollars worth of damage was done to the already struggling wine industry.
[00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:34.692]  125 aftershocks have followed the quake, and experts say there are more to come.
[00:18:35.292 --> 00:18:38.113]  One longtime resident describes the harrowing event.
[00:18:38.655 --> 00:18:47.039]  The jolting was from south to north, and I was grabbing onto the windowsill, and I was crying out to the Lord, Save me!
[00:18:47.099 --> 00:18:47.580]  Save me!
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:58.105]  And all I could see were flashes of electrical lightning outside, and all I could think about is, I'm going to get crushed in this house with my cat, and I'm going to die.
[00:18:59.266 --> 00:19:07.430]  And just one minute after the quake, I called my wife on my cell phone, and I said, You're not going to believe this,
[00:19:09.252 --> 00:19:10.013]  I almost died.
[00:19:10.033 --> 00:19:12.356]  I said, the house is ruined.
[00:19:12.396 --> 00:19:13.377]  But it really wasn't.
[00:19:13.437 --> 00:19:15.479]  But in my imagination, I was in shock.
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:19.103]  And I thought the house was going to come down.
[00:19:20.064 --> 00:19:24.970]  But it was all the dishes and all the glassware falling downstairs that caused all this.
[00:19:26.733 --> 00:19:29.976]  And all I can think about is, I'm going down with my house.
[00:19:30.736 --> 00:19:32.257]  And I'm going to die.
[00:19:32.538 --> 00:19:35.280]  It was the most violent shaking I've ever experienced.
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.422]  And it was from side to side.
[00:19:38.402 --> 00:19:42.926]  And with every jolt, I can hear more glass falling.
[00:19:43.546 --> 00:19:50.752]  And I'm thinking, the house is breaking apart, and I'm going down with my house, and I'm going to get crushed.
[00:19:51.713 --> 00:19:52.874]  And it was just utter fear.
[00:19:54.164 --> 00:19:57.545]  And you said you live in, your home was built in 1903.
[00:19:57.885 --> 00:20:02.027]  How did your house make it when there's so many other older homes around here that didn't?
[00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:04.808]  Well, there's a little story behind that.
[00:20:04.868 --> 00:20:16.231]  About 20 years ago, my insurance company, we have a new insurance company, so they forced me to bolt the house down to the foundation and put shear walls in the lower level.
[00:20:16.852 --> 00:20:21.813]  And I'm grumbling all the time I was doing it, but now I'm never going to grumble.
[00:20:22.714 --> 00:20:23.634]  Because that's what saved me.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.101]  They saved you and your cat and your house.
[00:20:26.982 --> 00:20:27.523]  Absolutely.
[00:20:27.783 --> 00:20:30.746]  Well, so a state of emergency was declared.
[00:20:30.786 --> 00:20:31.907]  Do you think that's appropriate?
[00:20:32.047 --> 00:20:34.869]  Well, I was one of the last blocks to get power.
[00:20:36.531 --> 00:20:40.594]  I went to a friend's house last night, but when I came home this morning, we had power.
[00:20:40.674 --> 00:20:41.855]  And we were one of the last.
[00:20:41.895 --> 00:20:45.739]  There were like 5,000 customers that didn't have power.
[00:20:46.099 --> 00:20:47.941]  And when I came home, we had power.
[00:20:48.281 --> 00:20:50.743]  Some of these buildings are well over 100 years old.
[00:20:52.546 --> 00:20:56.628]  And it's just not financially feasible to build them up.
[00:20:57.488 --> 00:21:01.670]  And it's just a sadness that you're going to lose part of the history of Napa.
[00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:08.194]  They said there's a 50-50 chance that there's going to be another 5.0 quake within the next five days.
[00:21:08.594 --> 00:21:14.997]  That that's something that's... Well, I don't know if they can actually prove that, but
[00:21:16.261 --> 00:21:17.464]  You live here in California.
[00:21:17.504 --> 00:21:20.249]  You're always prepared for an earthquake.
[00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:23.535]  Some of the things I've learned is I'm going to
[00:21:25.711 --> 00:21:40.424]  I'm going to fasten all my bookcases to the walls and I'm going to make sure that all my cabinets have locks on them, child proof locks, so there's a lot that's going to happen in my house and I'm sure other homeowners are going to be doing the same thing.
[00:21:41.205 --> 00:21:50.894]  In fact, about a year and a half ago I had a business idea and I was going to install these automatic gas shut off valves on gas meters and all my friends said, you know, they kind of laughed at me, but
[00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:52.800]  Would they be laughing now?
[00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:56.101]  It's just a gorgeous building and inside it's beautiful.
[00:21:56.921 --> 00:21:58.581]  And I don't know if they're going to be able to fix that.
[00:21:58.641 --> 00:21:59.522]  I just don't know how.
[00:21:59.942 --> 00:22:04.803]  So we've seen buildings, they have the yellow tape, which means that they're, you know, not fully.
[00:22:05.303 --> 00:22:05.603]  Yes.
[00:22:05.783 --> 00:22:08.163]  And then others that don't even really look that bad.
[00:22:08.203 --> 00:22:09.484]  I've got the red tape around it.
[00:22:09.584 --> 00:22:14.025]  Have we even seen the most devastating part of town yet?
[00:22:14.145 --> 00:22:15.145]  I mean, have you seen?
[00:22:15.305 --> 00:22:16.446]  Yeah, you're looking at it.
[00:22:16.886 --> 00:22:22.191]  But buildings like this, I mean, this is just architecture that you don't see anymore.
[00:22:22.211 --> 00:22:22.551]  Right.
[00:22:22.811 --> 00:22:30.357]  So, it's unfortunate, but I think nature has called the shots.
[00:22:30.618 --> 00:22:30.898]  Yeah.
[00:22:31.018 --> 00:22:32.919]  How do you feel about the wine industry?
[00:22:32.939 --> 00:22:34.361]  How do you think they're going to be affected by this?
[00:22:35.171 --> 00:22:39.438]  In a year we'll know exactly what it's costing, but right now we can only guess.
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:42.103]  It's going to be in the hundreds of millions.
[00:22:42.744 --> 00:22:43.204]  Guaranteed.
[00:22:43.605 --> 00:22:46.270]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com

[00:24:59.448 --> 00:24:59.968]  Welcome back.
[00:25:00.108 --> 00:25:06.532]  Now this weekend we've seen yet another volunteer worker brought from Africa to a Western country.
[00:25:06.913 --> 00:25:08.694]  This time it's to the UK.
[00:25:09.394 --> 00:25:13.116]  We're concerned about what's happening to our biosecurity protocols.
[00:25:13.176 --> 00:25:14.857]  Are they deliberately being stood down?
[00:25:14.897 --> 00:25:17.019]  So we wanted to talk to someone who is an expert.
[00:25:17.699 --> 00:25:29.667]  Dr. Richard Davis has a company that is actually developing an Ebola cure, so he's very familiar with the protocols, the level four security protocols that should be handled around this type of disease.
[00:25:30.247 --> 00:25:34.170]  He is a founder of five successful companies, two of which have gone public.
[00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:41.915]  He's a physician, inventor, and successful serial entrepreneur who has authored over 400 patents and trademarks worldwide.
[00:25:41.975 --> 00:25:43.817]  Joining us now is Dr. Richard Davis.
[00:25:44.557 --> 00:25:46.918]  Well, Dr. Davis, I want to talk to you about a number of things.
[00:25:47.018 --> 00:25:58.502]  I want to talk to you about the way that we see people increasingly being brought into Western countries for treatment rather than being treated there, the kind of containment and biosecurity issues that that raises.
[00:25:59.282 --> 00:26:08.025]  But you contacted us and told us that you had, within your company, some spectacular results treating Ebola before this outbreak occurred.
[00:26:08.065 --> 00:26:10.666]  You had a product called RC2 Beta.
[00:26:11.226 --> 00:26:12.407]  You said you were working with the U.S.
[00:26:12.467 --> 00:26:14.389]  Army at Fort Detrick over the past year.
[00:26:14.429 --> 00:26:24.658]  You had killed Ebola and a number of other deadly viruses in a way that had never occurred before that was entirely non-toxic to surrounding normal, uninfected cells, according to your email.
[00:26:24.898 --> 00:26:31.024]  So I want to talk to you about that, but before we get to that, let's talk about these cases of people coming to the United States.
[00:26:31.064 --> 00:26:37.330]  We just had in England, in the U.K., they just had a British Ebola patient arrive this last weekend for treatment.
[00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:54.639]  I thought it was kind of interesting that they said the patient is currently not seriously unwell, and yet in the pictures that we're looking at here, you can see them rolling his bed around with plastic on it, but you also see people that are in the vicinity of this patient that don't seem to have much, if any, protective clothing on it.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.321]  What are we seeing here as they're bringing people in?
[00:26:57.501 --> 00:27:01.103]  Are they following the biosecurity methods, or are they just ignoring them?
[00:27:02.697 --> 00:27:04.179]  Well, I think that that's a great question.
[00:27:04.219 --> 00:27:05.500]  And thank you for having me on.
[00:27:06.261 --> 00:27:07.523]  David, it's a pleasure.
[00:27:09.265 --> 00:27:21.299]  My experience goes back to my days in the Navy, where I received a significant amount of nuclear biological and chemical training, as part of my being part of a readiness command.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:22.621]  And I think that
[00:27:23.306 --> 00:27:29.354]  That my understanding at that time, and I don't think it's changed since, that we wouldn't have done it this way.
[00:27:30.675 --> 00:27:40.187]  Patients that have these kinds of very, very deadly and potentially very contagious infections would be treated in a way that would be vastly different.
[00:27:41.207 --> 00:27:58.355]  I think that at a very minimum, if the idea, and I don't understand the rationale for bringing these people out of country as opposed to bringing the drugs in, which would have been the most conservative approach, but if you had a compelling reason to get these people out of country,
[00:27:59.556 --> 00:28:13.888]  There are a number of level 3 portable and mobile containment facilities that are readily available that could be put on board ships so that the contagion could be limited to just shipboard personnel.
[00:28:14.268 --> 00:28:22.035]  It could be much easier to isolate those people and it might be a better step as opposed to bringing them into very populated areas where
[00:28:23.082 --> 00:28:26.466]  I do not know if the Emory facility is a level four.
[00:28:26.666 --> 00:28:27.547]  I just don't know.
[00:28:27.567 --> 00:28:33.333]  I've done a lot of reading and I can't find what the level of that facility is.
[00:28:33.653 --> 00:28:35.014]  Let me get your response to this.
[00:28:35.094 --> 00:28:40.600]  As somebody who obviously has worked with Ebola, you know what the procedures and protocols are.
[00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:44.464]  I came across an article that I found very disturbing.
[00:28:44.504 --> 00:28:45.104]  It was from a
[00:28:45.885 --> 00:28:46.286]  I don't know.
[00:29:03.544 --> 00:29:06.648]  But they say that he basically has just flouted these regulations.
[00:29:06.668 --> 00:29:08.130]  They're calling on him to be fired.
[00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:16.940]  One of the things that they, some of the things that they pointed out, they said it's encouraging, it isn't encouraging to see this doctor who was brought back, Dr. Brantley, who's now cured, fortunately.
[00:29:17.281 --> 00:29:21.466]  But they say that he was seen walking around in a hazmat suit when this first began.
[00:29:21.926 --> 00:29:22.306]  I think so.
[00:29:42.122 --> 00:29:52.309]  He was treated on the ground floor, even though in Africa, where they had the center of this outbreak, they had a separate facility for these kind of hemorrhagic fevers.
[00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:56.412]  They didn't keep it in the same hospital building where they were treating other patients.
[00:29:56.432 --> 00:29:59.394]  Yet he's brought into the ground floor of a hospital there.
[00:29:59.434 --> 00:30:00.295]  Could you comment on that?
[00:30:01.502 --> 00:30:04.864]  Well, I think that they're mistaken about that.
[00:30:05.184 --> 00:30:05.424]  Okay.
[00:30:05.544 --> 00:30:11.688]  Since that the hazmat suits with the positive pressure are meant to prevent you from becoming infected.
[00:30:11.968 --> 00:30:15.330]  They're meant to keep things from the outer world from getting to you.
[00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:22.254]  If you're already infected and put yourself under positive pressure, you would simply be pushing the virus out into the surrounding area.
[00:30:23.475 --> 00:30:39.346]  I can understand why they didn't provide a positive pressure, but they did provide a fully contained hazmat suit for his brief transportation between the vehicle and the containment facility of whatever degree it might happen to be.
[00:30:39.867 --> 00:30:42.048]  So I would actually agree with that.
[00:30:42.329 --> 00:30:46.692]  My concern is why bring him to a very populated place in the first place?
[00:30:46.972 --> 00:30:47.172]  Yes.
[00:30:47.832 --> 00:30:51.393]  I simply don't understand what the compelling reason for doing that.
[00:30:51.813 --> 00:30:52.433]  There may be one.
[00:30:52.733 --> 00:30:54.273]  I simply am not aware of what that might be.
[00:30:54.694 --> 00:30:58.294]  It seems like it would be far easier to send the treatment to them.
[00:30:58.814 --> 00:31:05.236]  Now, I did see some information that he did receive, of course, the ZMapp vaccine in-country.
[00:31:05.776 --> 00:31:15.818]  Perhaps, do you believe that he was brought here after he had responded favorably to that, where they believe that he was not as contagious, perhaps, or in later stages of recovery?
[00:31:16.758 --> 00:31:17.799]  Do you know anything about that?
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.341]  I don't have any information about that.
[00:31:20.661 --> 00:31:30.589]  I'm just delighted that he recovered and the ZMapp technology worked as advertised because it was apparently the first time that it had ever been used in humans.
[00:31:31.049 --> 00:31:35.412]  It had been obviously used in non-human primates before with success.
[00:31:35.913 --> 00:31:37.494]  So I'm delighted that
[00:31:37.834 --> 00:31:40.455]  That there is a technology out there for this disease.
[00:31:41.115 --> 00:32:03.404]  I just think that there may be some potential limitations to its ultimate use because it is a biological, requires a lot of steps, a tremendous amount of purification and other things which although they have become increasingly routine, you wouldn't think that a vaccine of this nature would ever be considered anything like being routine.
[00:32:03.704 --> 00:32:03.824]  Yes.
[00:32:04.364 --> 00:32:05.625]  Now, we're almost out of time.
[00:32:05.645 --> 00:32:06.805]  We've got a couple of minutes left.
[00:32:06.925 --> 00:32:10.647]  I wanted to get on to your treatment and kind of compare it to the ZMapp treatment.
[00:32:10.667 --> 00:32:14.428]  The ZMapp treatment, as I read about how it works, concerns me on a number of levels.
[00:32:14.488 --> 00:32:16.529]  First, they give the disease to some mice.
[00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:19.731]  Then, as they develop antibodies, they genetically modify those.
[00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:23.532]  Then, they put them in a genetically modified tobacco plant to grow them.
[00:32:23.933 --> 00:32:29.295]  Then, they take the plant-a-bodies that come out of that GMO tobacco and inject that into people.
[00:32:29.875 --> 00:32:36.256]  In a sense, basically already having the antibodies created so that you don't have to create them in your own body.
[00:32:36.536 --> 00:32:42.757]  So instead of injecting you with a weakened or dead form of the disease, they directly inject what they call plant-a-bodies.
[00:32:42.817 --> 00:32:45.618]  And you had some spectacular results, as you point out in your email.
[00:32:46.198 --> 00:32:49.798]  Tell us what happened as you were working with the Army at Fort Detrick.
[00:32:50.058 --> 00:32:58.120]  You were doing tests there and they were seeing the results, and yet, as this outbreak was happening in Africa, basically it went silent.
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:58.600]  Is that correct?
[00:32:59.397 --> 00:32:59.897]  That's correct.
[00:33:00.558 --> 00:33:04.722]  I think that, you know, the results that we had were in tissue culture.
[00:33:05.142 --> 00:33:14.190]  We had not yet advanced to animal studies, although the drug has been used by the company that we acquired this technology from.
[00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:20.416]  They had actually had some experience in both horses and man in the use of this drug for different indications.
[00:33:21.256 --> 00:33:27.802]  The drug has been tried, but in uncontrolled trials, which would have to be considered anecdotal by any scientific perspective.
[00:33:28.142 --> 00:33:29.743]  But at least the data is there.
[00:33:30.104 --> 00:33:31.725]  There was some experience.
[00:33:32.365 --> 00:33:41.273]  And the fact is that when we provided this with the Army, they tested it against a number of different viruses from a number of different viral families.
[00:33:41.953 --> 00:33:43.573]  And the results were spectacular.
[00:33:44.154 --> 00:33:54.756]  With increasing dose, we were approaching 100% kill in Ebola with 100% kill of Marburg virus, Rift Valley fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis.
[00:33:55.156 --> 00:34:05.078]  And we've seen in other treatments, in other disease indications at other research facilities, its effectiveness against a number of different viral targets.
[00:34:05.458 --> 00:34:06.820]  We're out of time, Dr. Davis.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:19.896]  I certainly hope that your research continues, because I'm very concerned about the complexity, the mechanisms, and the possible adverse side effects of this GMO vaccine, ZMapp, and whether it might be mandated for the general population.
[00:34:19.916 --> 00:34:22.158]  Thank you so much for joining us, and thank you for your research.
[00:34:22.659 --> 00:34:23.220]  Thank you, David.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.141]  Appreciate it very much.
[00:34:24.241 --> 00:34:24.561]  Thank you.
[00:34:24.721 --> 00:34:24.962]  Bye-bye.
[00:34:25.555 --> 00:34:45.653]  Well of course my concern is that these people are being brought back, our protocols are being violated, because they want to create a PR campaign of panic and then show them as being cured so they can then roll out a massive mandatory campaign of vaccinations using these kinds of genetically modified vaccines.
[00:34:46.334 --> 00:35:02.480]  We know that it's cured this one doctor and also the assistant that was with him, who was brought back, Dr. Brantley, but what are the long-term consequences of this and what are they going to add to it once they start mass producing it like they do other vaccines?
[00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:06.401]  Well, stay with us because we're going to continue to cover this as it develops.
[00:35:06.481 --> 00:35:10.323]  And if you're a Prison Planet TV subscriber, we'll keep you updated.
[00:35:10.343 --> 00:35:14.284]  It's something that you can share with up to 11 other people simultaneously.
[00:35:14.584 --> 00:35:16.565]  It helps to support our operation here.
[00:35:17.105 --> 00:35:21.667]  And you can also share with those people all the documentaries of Alex Jones.
[00:35:22.227 --> 00:35:23.007]  Well, that's it for tonight.
[00:35:23.027 --> 00:35:25.308]  We'll be back tomorrow at 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[00:35:25.348 --> 00:35:25.608]  Eastern.
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:36.926]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:35:37.286 --> 00:35:38.747]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:35:38.787 --> 00:35:40.148]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:35:40.429 --> 00:35:41.550]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:46.874]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:46.994 --> 00:35:50.738]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[00:36:28.177 --> 00:36:37.223]  It was about six and a half years ago, Obama was president-elect, and I sat in here in this very green room at Cap City Comedy Club, Joe.
[00:36:37.563 --> 00:36:39.384]  That video's been seen about 40 million times now.
[00:36:39.424 --> 00:36:40.005]  It's ridiculous.
[00:36:40.669 --> 00:36:41.150]  Literally.
[00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:43.772]  Like 14 million on just one spot on YouTube.
[00:36:43.872 --> 00:36:44.593]  That's ridiculous.
[00:36:44.993 --> 00:36:52.581]  You early on, when everybody else was saying Obama was the savior, you were saying, why does anybody expect him to be any different?
[00:36:53.902 --> 00:36:56.985]  And it was like right when he was president-elect or right when he got out of office.
[00:36:57.126 --> 00:37:00.529]  It's pretty obvious that there's some gigantic financial institutions
[00:37:00.779 --> 00:37:04.181]  That have been pulling the strings of politicians in this country for a long time.
[00:37:04.561 --> 00:37:11.404]  And just the fact that we have it set up where they can donate millions of dollars to these guys' funds, these guys' campaigns.
[00:37:11.784 --> 00:37:14.566]  I mean, how do we not expect it all to go bad?
[00:37:15.026 --> 00:37:17.547]  They put so much into him, built him up as his big brand name.
[00:37:17.587 --> 00:37:18.267]  What's your take on that?
[00:37:18.407 --> 00:37:19.168]  Well, you know what, man?
[00:37:19.188 --> 00:37:21.689]  I don't even think Obama is to blame.
[00:37:22.449 --> 00:37:23.110]  I really don't.
[00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:25.471]  I don't think there's an individual that's to blame.
[00:37:26.408 --> 00:37:51.076]  I think that what we're looking at, and I'm obviously no political expert by any means, but as a person who's observing a system, who's a person who's observing this strange society that we live in and how it's influenced by money and corporations and how politicians are beholden to so many different groups before they get into any positions of power.
[00:37:51.916 --> 00:37:54.339]  It's incredibly difficult to change anything.
[00:37:54.839 --> 00:38:01.766]  And it's not like this statement about Obama as President or Obama as a person.
[00:38:02.086 --> 00:38:06.010]  It's more that the system is so intertangled.
[00:38:06.511 --> 00:38:07.852]  It's so intertwined.
[00:38:08.154 --> 00:38:26.333]  With political interest groups, and with lobbyists, and with corporations having mad control over the political system, over who gets represented, who represents which party, the people that have the most money historically have done the best.
[00:38:26.755 --> 00:38:29.116]  I mean, it's like a big, crazy money grab.
[00:38:29.336 --> 00:38:36.799]  And then these people get into these positions of power, and I don't think they have nearly as much control as we like to think they do.
[00:38:37.319 --> 00:38:43.402]  And I think he gets into this position of power, and I think it's probably just a melee in there.
[00:38:43.902 --> 00:38:55.947]  A melee of money, and lobbyists, and the military-industrial complex, and influence of foreign leaders, and chaos, and threats of terrorism.
[00:38:56.607 --> 00:38:57.747]  Jesus Christ!
[00:38:57.827 --> 00:39:00.048]  I mean, could you imagine that guy's job?
[00:39:00.128 --> 00:39:01.329]  It's an impossible job!
[00:39:01.369 --> 00:39:08.591]  It's an impossible job for any person, for any person, for any one person to try to turn this crazy ship around.
[00:39:08.972 --> 00:39:13.053]  So I didn't have any faith in his ability to do it, but I bet nobody can do that job.
[00:39:13.473 --> 00:39:15.414]  I think that job is almost impossible.
[00:39:16.454 --> 00:39:27.324]  It's almost impossible to be some person who's going to make everybody happy and who's also going to make all the people that got you into power happy and then make the culture happy.
[00:39:27.344 --> 00:39:35.331]  Well that's a true story, what's in the movie, Nixon with Oliver Stone that he produced, where Nixon goes out to the memorial at night.
[00:39:36.374 --> 00:39:39.597]  And then all the anti-war folks come up to him and all the anti-Nixon people.
[00:39:39.617 --> 00:39:41.758]  He goes, look, it's a big beast, a big machine.
[00:39:41.798 --> 00:39:42.539]  I can't stop it.
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:50.485]  I think that's exactly... I mean, I think the beast that Nixon faced was probably still way too big for anybody to handle.
[00:39:50.765 --> 00:39:53.788]  But I think that the beast Obama faces is far bigger.
[00:39:54.466 --> 00:39:55.947]  It's far crazier.
[00:39:56.147 --> 00:39:56.988]  It's the whole thing.
[00:39:57.929 --> 00:39:59.991]  And the stakes are higher.
[00:40:00.371 --> 00:40:11.380]  Because the wars we're in are so preposterous after Vietnam, there's this sort of despair that happens when people realize, like, we didn't learn anything.
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:13.161]  We didn't learn anything.
[00:40:13.602 --> 00:40:22.329]  We're still involved in quagmires in other countries that cost massive, massive amounts of lives, both Americans and other people.
[00:40:22.714 --> 00:40:26.836]  We get caught in these things and they're incredibly disappointing for people.
[00:40:27.116 --> 00:40:31.638]  When we look at our culture, I think America likes to be a proud country.
[00:40:31.658 --> 00:40:37.960]  We like to look at ourselves as really like a special type of people.
[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:40.161]  We're the children of immigrants.
[00:40:40.578 --> 00:40:44.041]  The crazy people that came here when everybody else was banking on Europe.
[00:40:44.122 --> 00:40:45.963]  We were like, let's get on a boat.
[00:40:46.063 --> 00:40:47.985]  And hundreds of years ago, those were our ancestors.
[00:40:48.246 --> 00:40:49.327]  And this is where we are today.
[00:40:49.767 --> 00:40:53.351]  But if you look at our actions, it's depressing.
[00:40:54.224 --> 00:41:01.667]  For people to look at the actions of their country and not totally be able to defend something that we've done militarily.
[00:41:02.047 --> 00:41:15.812]  You know, when people look at that and they go, I don't, you know, there's a lot of people that I know that are patriots, a lot of people that I know that are veterans, that love America, that believe in the military, and they're very upset with the way the direction of these wars has gone.
[00:41:16.692 --> 00:41:21.174]  Very upset with the image that it's given America worldwide.
[00:41:21.614 --> 00:41:22.735]  You know, there's the famous
[00:41:24.656 --> 00:41:34.320]  The point that many people had right after September 11th was this was an incredible time where there was so much sympathy of these other nations.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.662]  They were so on the side of America that America had been attacked.
[00:41:37.882 --> 00:41:38.622]  This is horrible.
[00:41:38.642 --> 00:41:39.642]  The whole world was watching.
[00:41:40.123 --> 00:41:47.886]  And within a period of a few years, our actions were so f***ed up that we lost all that sympathy.
[00:41:47.906 --> 00:41:52.488]  There was this moment where America had this position of love.
[00:41:52.981 --> 00:41:53.522]  We're good to go.
[00:42:12.315 --> 00:42:14.697]  Where does your gut tell you the country's going?
[00:42:14.857 --> 00:42:21.624]  Because so many people that the metrics show towards some type of collapse, not just here, but worldwide.
[00:42:21.684 --> 00:42:24.806]  I know you personally have been moving towards getting off the grid some.
[00:42:25.527 --> 00:42:28.330]  Well, I think getting off the grid's a good idea just because the grid is goofy.
[00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:33.995]  If you could figure out a way to make your own electricity and get your own water out of the ground, like, why would you not do that?
[00:42:34.015 --> 00:42:37.979]  As long as you're testing your water and you know that your water's good, it just seems awesome.
[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:41.401]  It seems like a cool thing to be able to get your electricity from the sun.
[00:42:42.081 --> 00:42:45.283]  But I don't think necessarily civilization is going to collapse.
[00:42:46.203 --> 00:42:49.705]  I think people far smarter than me have engineered this thing.
[00:42:49.725 --> 00:42:56.508]  I just think that we're just in a weird period of life.
[00:42:57.068 --> 00:42:59.369]  We're also in a weird period of information.
[00:42:59.809 --> 00:43:01.390]  It's a weird period of like the news.
[00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:03.271]  You know, like this Edward Snowden stuff.
[00:43:04.291 --> 00:43:05.932]  You know, Glenn Greenwald.
[00:43:06.448 --> 00:43:11.092]  The ability to distribute a big crazy story like that has completely shifted.
[00:43:11.653 --> 00:43:13.655]  It's not only like the New York Times.
[00:43:13.735 --> 00:43:15.537]  It's not only like a corporation.
[00:43:15.957 --> 00:43:20.021]  It's small individuals have this weird ability to do stuff like that now.
[00:43:20.321 --> 00:43:21.462]  World changing stuff.
[00:43:23.064 --> 00:43:24.685]  It's almost like a pre-singularities.
[00:43:25.126 --> 00:43:28.108]  Like smaller waves building up to bigger waves.
[00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:33.152]  I mean, that's how I knew about the NSA and the hubs and the major buildings.
[00:43:33.592 --> 00:43:37.354]  Remember, like, in 1999, I'd be telling you about that stuff and how they were listening to everything?
[00:43:37.434 --> 00:43:42.196]  Dude, you thought they were spying on everything way before anybody did.
[00:43:42.517 --> 00:43:43.537]  But I'm up to my horn.
[00:43:43.677 --> 00:43:44.017]  I didn't.
[00:43:44.398 --> 00:43:45.138]  I was at Psyche.
[00:43:45.158 --> 00:43:46.259]  Yeah, but it's not just that.
[00:43:46.299 --> 00:43:46.979]  It was in the documents.
[00:43:47.019 --> 00:43:48.380]  You had the documents.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:49.380]  You had the documents.
[00:43:50.261 --> 00:43:57.064]  One thing that I always tell everybody, like, the first video that I ever saw that made me go, what?
[00:43:57.284 --> 00:43:58.265]  They do that?
[00:43:59.045 --> 00:43:59.726]  That's real?
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.042]  There's a peaceful protest in order to make it non-peaceful.
[00:44:19.062 --> 00:44:28.991]  You have these guys coming with government-issue boots, ski masks, f*** everything up, smash things, and then they turn it into like a war zone, so then the cops get to move in and arrest everybody.
[00:44:29.251 --> 00:44:31.153]  They made the whole thing a no-protest zone.
[00:44:31.413 --> 00:44:34.636]  These guys, they get holed up in some house somewhere, right?
[00:44:34.656 --> 00:44:36.157]  Yeah, they got to pay for their house.
[00:44:37.118 --> 00:44:38.699]  And then they negotiated them free.
[00:44:39.059 --> 00:44:39.820]  They got free.
[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:43.003]  So these guys, they like smashed all these windows.
[00:44:43.043 --> 00:44:44.344]  And they had the Delta Force running.
[00:44:45.479 --> 00:44:47.460]  I mean, people in Seattle knew about that.
[00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:50.942]  I was being called a conspiracy theorist just because I had the local newspapers from there.
[00:44:51.222 --> 00:44:53.203]  It sounds so crazy.
[00:44:53.443 --> 00:44:55.124]  If someone tells you that, you go, that's crazy.
[00:44:55.324 --> 00:45:00.987]  But then you find out that is actually a tactic that gets used to break up protests.
[00:45:01.907 --> 00:45:02.107]  I think.
[00:45:21.784 --> 00:45:26.026]  Megan, any sign yet of police trying to track them down?
[00:45:26.106 --> 00:45:27.247]  There's no silent police anywhere.
[00:45:27.267 --> 00:45:28.048]  They're gone, Mike.
[00:45:28.068 --> 00:45:31.229]  They're breaking the bank window here at US Bank.
[00:45:31.289 --> 00:45:32.750]  We gotta get out of here.
[00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:38.314]  We're gonna run up the street because if they see us, they attack us.
[00:45:38.454 --> 00:45:40.455]  And so we're keeping a safe distance away from them.
[00:45:41.078 --> 00:45:48.203]  Several police officers have told us because they were assigned to control the protest crowds, they weren't allowed to break ranks and to stop the black bloc.
[00:45:48.543 --> 00:45:51.745]  So the group just continued destroying property for nearly an hour.
[00:45:52.932 --> 00:45:54.333]  What's wrong with this picture?
[00:45:54.394 --> 00:45:59.178]  If the police are supposedly there to protect the public and property, then why?
[00:45:59.479 --> 00:46:15.055]  Why did State Police, Seattle Police, as well as the Feds, stand back and allow the anarchists, en masse, to run around and throw bottles at police, cones, rocks, you name it, and assault private property, as well as members of the general public?
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:20.003]  Because they needed someone to demonize the rest of the good demonstrators.
[00:46:20.603 --> 00:46:23.545]  Now, my friends, this is an old tactic throughout history.
[00:46:24.025 --> 00:46:38.774]  If you have opposition, you simply demonize them by creating your own crisis, your own massacre, or terrorist bombing, or incident, and then blaming it on your political opponents.
[00:46:39.594 --> 00:46:46.699]  When you have 50, 60,000 peaceful demonstrators out exposing the corruption, how do you neutralize them?
[00:46:47.379 --> 00:46:52.083]  Well, you simply send in your boys to create a crisis to offer a solution.
[00:46:52.103 --> 00:46:55.285]  Now, we're not saying that local police knew what was going on.
[00:46:55.645 --> 00:46:56.206]  Certainly not.
[00:46:56.246 --> 00:47:00.288]  They just were following their orders, which is frightening in and of itself to
[00:47:01.249 --> 00:47:08.011]  Let a bunch of anarchists, 30 or 40 of them tops, run around and burn and break things because they were ordered to do so?
[00:47:08.492 --> 00:47:11.573]  It's hard for most people to witness chaos and destruction.
[00:47:11.993 --> 00:47:16.374]  But Detective Donnie Lowe says as a police officer at the scene... I was embarrassed.
[00:47:16.514 --> 00:47:23.917]  Lowe and his fellow officers were under orders to hold their ground last Tuesday when protesters blocked access to the convention center.
[00:47:24.537 --> 00:47:29.739]  He says it was painful to watch the crowd harass delegates and not be able to help them.
[00:47:30.359 --> 00:47:33.942]  He wasn't even allowed to catch the crooks looting downtown businesses.
[00:47:34.243 --> 00:47:40.108]  I watched this guy loot Nike Town, sit in the window of Nike Town.
[00:47:41.049 --> 00:47:45.193]  At some point in time, the employees of Nike Town, they were chased out.
[00:47:45.213 --> 00:47:49.757]  And they came running to us for assistance, and we wasn't allowed to do anything.
[00:47:51.124 --> 00:47:54.807]  Detective Lowe has, well, half the answer right.
[00:47:55.308 --> 00:47:57.069]  He's got half the picture in his hands.
[00:47:57.189 --> 00:48:13.883]  Certainly, it's horrible, it's inexcusable that city leaders, under the control of the federal government in Seattle, would instruct the police not to apprehend criminals while they were engaging in crimes publicly.
[00:48:14.804 --> 00:48:18.867]  Crimes like robbery, arson, and assault.
[00:48:19.761 --> 00:48:29.767]  That makes the police chief, the mayor, the Justice Department, the Delta Force, the FBI, you name them, running this operation guilty as accomplices.
[00:48:30.748 --> 00:48:35.470]  But in a second, Detective Lowe falls for the old trick we've been talking so much about.
[00:48:35.971 --> 00:48:37.832]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[00:48:37.872 --> 00:48:40.754]  He says, you know, we were attacked out there for a day.
[00:48:41.914 --> 00:48:47.878]  But you know, later the city got it together and we went ahead and declared the emergency while we had the no protest zone.
[00:48:47.918 --> 00:48:49.239]  Yeah, half the city.
[00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:52.096]  Why the civil emergency was needed.
[00:48:52.177 --> 00:48:54.645]  We finally, you know, we got to get tough on them.
[00:48:55.345 --> 00:49:12.892]  Yeah, you got to get tough on all the peaceful demonstrators that were shutting down the WTO, the World Trade Organization, and now when people think of protesters across the country, especially city leaders, city managers and others say, boy, we better crack down, we better ban protests here, too!
[00:49:13.352 --> 00:49:18.715]  And they're passing ordinances across the nation to implement emergencies whenever they feel like it.
[00:49:19.175 --> 00:49:21.776]  And the federal government is rubbing its hands together.
[00:49:23.101 --> 00:49:31.060]  All started by 30 to 40 anarchists, running around, burning and beating and smashing and stealing.
[00:49:32.088 --> 00:49:47.254]  And the police, like dogs at the end of a chain, a Rottweiler you've been slapping, suddenly had their leashes released and with wanton abandon, they rampaged out in a berserk fashion and attacked old ladies, store owners, you name it.
[00:49:47.814 --> 00:49:50.896]  And then they got to ship everybody to the FEMA Center!
[00:49:50.976 --> 00:49:51.996]  That's right!
[00:49:52.156 --> 00:49:57.658]  FEMA was helping during this learning process for everyone.
[00:49:57.678 --> 00:50:01.440]  I think our biggest problem here was
[00:50:03.493 --> 00:50:08.915]  Leadership within this department refused to take appropriate actions when it was clearly necessary.
[00:50:09.735 --> 00:50:15.618]  If you thought the anarchists who commandeered a privately owned downtown building were out of town now, well, think again.
[00:50:15.638 --> 00:50:21.580]  As Carbo 7 Eyewitness News reporter Christina McKenna has found out, they're still here and still living rent-free.
[00:50:22.324 --> 00:50:27.768]  Susan, when these anarchists moved out of the building behind me on Saturday, a lot of people thought they should have been headed to jail.
[00:50:28.108 --> 00:50:37.695]  Instead, it turns out, a lot of them just headed around the corner, and they're now living in a building right over here, where they're enjoying electricity, hot water, and heat, all rent-free.
[00:50:39.577 --> 00:50:41.919]  Saturday afternoon was a celebration here.
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:48.866]  Seven days after they commandeered this downtown building, anarchists walked away without a word from police.
[00:50:49.167 --> 00:50:50.188]  It feels to me like we won.
[00:50:50.548 --> 00:50:52.310]  And at least some are still winning.
[00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:58.176]  As part of the deal to get them to surrender this building, anarchists were offered housing just around the corner.
[00:50:58.656 --> 00:50:59.697]  At the same price.
[00:51:00.258 --> 00:51:10.889]  The building is owned by the Low Income Housing Institute, a private non-profit that is in large part funded by the city, and is now working with the city to house the anarchists.
[00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:15.775]  First of all, the criminal trespass, if that was me or you, or the average person out on the street, we'd be in jail.
[00:51:16.317 --> 00:51:19.458]  John Satoli can't believe the anarchists aren't in jail now.
[00:51:19.758 --> 00:51:28.501]  As a lawful tenant in the building the anarchists had seized, he was locked out of his packaging and shipping business for a week during his busiest season.
[00:51:28.921 --> 00:51:36.104]  Satoli can't believe he's now contemplating bankruptcy and the people who put them there have paid no consequence at all.
[00:51:36.344 --> 00:51:36.944]  They walked away.
[00:51:36.964 --> 00:51:44.247]  They walked away and they, the city of Seattle, low-income housing, moved them across the street on me and yours taxpayers' dollars.
[00:51:45.205 --> 00:51:48.949]  So why didn't the police department arrest the anarchists when they moved out of that building?
[00:51:49.029 --> 00:51:54.135]  Well, that's a question a lot of people are asking, especially since the West Precinct is just down the block.
[00:51:54.456 --> 00:51:56.118]  We asked the police department this weekend.
[00:51:56.278 --> 00:51:57.279]  We asked them again today.
[00:51:57.299 --> 00:51:59.482]  They still haven't returned our call with an answer.
[00:51:59.662 --> 00:52:04.948]  Instead of eviction, police asked housing activists to negotiate with demonstrators.
[00:52:05.228 --> 00:52:17.977]  Sharon Lee of the Low Income Housing Institute convinced the protesters to voluntarily leave the building in part by offering them temporary housing in a private non-profit shelter around the corner.
[00:52:18.916 --> 00:52:24.558]  The best behavior I saw was by the Seattle Police Department, the Washington State Patrol, and the Federal Bureau of Investigations.
[00:52:24.819 --> 00:52:26.579]  From the city's standpoint, we had security.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:29.541]  And at least 20 agencies were involved.
[00:52:29.601 --> 00:52:38.624]  We had the lead, but clearly the Secret Service, the FBI, all the state and local agencies dealing with security, the Port of Seattle, ATF.
[00:52:40.825 --> 00:52:53.034]  And a lot of work from traveling to Geneva to looking at the NATO conference in Washington, D.C., trying to do the best they could to understand what both the threat was and then how to plan to do it.
[00:52:53.234 --> 00:52:57.657]  From the start to the finish and even after, the anarchists were housed.
[00:52:58.158 --> 00:52:59.138]  They were protected.
[00:52:59.559 --> 00:53:02.241]  They were not to be arrested by Seattle police.
[00:53:02.941 --> 00:53:04.982]  It's a staged, managed operation.
[00:53:05.722 --> 00:53:19.787]  After the anarchists had put on their display for the news cameras, the authorities had all they needed to rationalize a total suspension of civil as well as human rights, publicly, in front of everyone's eyes.
[00:53:20.167 --> 00:53:27.550]  They started declaring that people couldn't have banners or posters or even stickers or buttons on their clothes against the WTO.
[00:53:28.517 --> 00:53:35.217]  Anyone who got in their way was arrested and shipped to a FEMA center, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
[00:53:36.172 --> 00:53:51.096]  In direct violation of Posse Comitatus had Delta Force on the ground from day one of the demonstrations and protests, continually integrating the local state, county, and city police under federal command.
[00:53:51.356 --> 00:53:59.538]  This should be a giant red flag for any American concerned about their God-given rights and their freedom in this country.
[00:54:00.424 --> 00:54:03.006]  That WTO stuff is one of the most telling things I've ever seen.
[00:54:03.026 --> 00:54:04.868]  I was like, wow, that's really what they do.
[00:54:04.888 --> 00:54:05.949]  They really do do that.
[00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:07.991]  But it makes sense.
[00:54:09.812 --> 00:54:13.075]  Engineering like that has been done throughout military history, right?
[00:54:13.115 --> 00:54:14.957]  I mean, haven't they always done things like that?
[00:54:15.638 --> 00:54:17.099]  I wasn't here, but now I am.
[00:54:17.179 --> 00:54:18.080]  I've teleported over.
[00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:19.061]  I made him sit next to me.
[00:54:19.281 --> 00:54:19.881]  I get lonely.
[00:54:19.961 --> 00:54:22.664]  Look at this guy over here.
[00:54:23.937 --> 00:54:25.818]  So, let's talk about your comedy career.
[00:54:26.218 --> 00:54:27.899]  It just keeps getting bigger and bigger.
[00:54:27.919 --> 00:54:31.421]  I mean, you've got to be now one of the most famous people in comedy.
[00:54:32.161 --> 00:54:37.985]  Not just in the current times, but overall, you're in the pantheon now of the greats.
[00:54:38.025 --> 00:54:38.985]  Well, that's ridiculous.
[00:54:39.065 --> 00:54:40.006]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:54:40.026 --> 00:54:41.446]  This is a lot of great comics.
[00:54:41.486 --> 00:54:44.248]  People don't get excited about The Office without many people, buddy.
[00:54:44.508 --> 00:54:46.049]  And all over, folks talk about you.
[00:54:46.089 --> 00:54:46.869]  Well, that's so nice of them.
[00:54:46.889 --> 00:54:51.532]  I know you don't want to hear about yourself all day, but it's fun to hear that your comedy's really... Look, you're growing exponentially.
[00:54:52.626 --> 00:54:55.929]  Um, well, I think, uh, I'm definitely working at it.
[00:54:55.949 --> 00:54:58.051]  I'm doing a lot of stand-up, and I love it.
[00:54:58.071 --> 00:54:59.132]  It's so much fun.
[00:54:59.632 --> 00:55:01.714]  I think that's the key to the whole thing, for me.
[00:55:01.734 --> 00:55:03.636]  It's just, I really enjoy it.
[00:55:06.518 --> 00:55:11.563]  I'm Joe Austin, I present to you one of my funniest pals, the host of the Joe Rogan Experience.
[00:55:11.683 --> 00:55:14.745]  See how long you can get when I say my name, Joe Rogan.
[00:55:30.161 --> 00:55:30.921]  I enjoy writing.
[00:55:30.941 --> 00:55:33.124]  I enjoy creating new stuff.
[00:55:33.244 --> 00:55:34.485]  I enjoy putting it together.
[00:55:34.505 --> 00:55:40.472]  I enjoy making people laugh and I enjoy people feeling like they got their money's worth.
[00:55:40.572 --> 00:55:42.013]  I want it to be a good exchange.
[00:55:42.033 --> 00:55:45.517]  It means a lot to me that people have a good time.
[00:55:45.717 --> 00:55:47.019]  It's very, very important.
[00:55:47.439 --> 00:55:48.380]  Like, I never take it lightly.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:51.622]  There's no roof on Earth and we're flying through space.
[00:55:52.023 --> 00:55:55.805]  Yeah, you should be f***ing your pants all the time.
[00:55:55.886 --> 00:55:58.487]  It's ridiculous that that doesn't even get brought up.
[00:55:58.688 --> 00:56:03.911]  You're on a ball that's spinning a thousand miles an hour in a circle.
[00:56:04.052 --> 00:56:11.177]  And it's floating in the sky next to a giant fireball that's a million times bigger than Earth.
[00:56:11.557 --> 00:56:12.538]  And no one talks.
[00:56:12.638 --> 00:56:13.639]  Oh, the sun's up.
[00:56:13.719 --> 00:56:16.261]  That's a floating f***ing fireball that wants to kill you!
[00:56:16.761 --> 00:56:19.923]  It's trying to give you cancer!
[00:56:20.243 --> 00:56:22.064]  If you stare at it, you go blind!
[00:56:22.084 --> 00:56:23.765]  Do you think that the world's going to collapse?
[00:56:24.425 --> 00:56:28.307]  Well, it's a designed... Doesn't everybody always think the world's going to collapse?
[00:56:28.327 --> 00:56:28.507]  Sure.
[00:56:28.747 --> 00:56:30.769]  Because sometimes civilization does collapse.
[00:56:30.889 --> 00:56:31.129]  Yeah.
[00:56:31.269 --> 00:56:32.009]  In different periods.
[00:56:32.029 --> 00:56:33.410]  And so that's kind of a racial memory.
[00:56:34.310 --> 00:56:36.972]  It is so cold-blooded how it's all been actuaried out.
[00:56:38.913 --> 00:56:40.194]  It's to consolidate power.
[00:56:40.334 --> 00:56:43.615]  It's to... And it's not for American interest.
[00:56:43.675 --> 00:56:44.416]  It's just that we...
[00:56:44.909 --> 00:56:51.832]  Have it under the heavy or engineering a lot of other countries that's why things are being tested out the Empire test things out here.
[00:56:52.172 --> 00:56:54.493]  Are we like the Columbus Ohio for the Empire?
[00:56:55.234 --> 00:56:55.674]  I think so.
[00:56:55.874 --> 00:56:57.615]  You know Columbus Ohio where Brian's from?
[00:56:58.675 --> 00:57:08.139]  He said that when he grew up there he would get products they would test products like new cereals and didn't didn't exist anywhere else in the country they tested out in Columbus.
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:09.880]  Well that's it
[00:57:10.478 --> 00:57:16.901]  The elite can use these Machiavellian tactics and social engineering and propaganda and focus groups to have control.
[00:57:17.482 --> 00:57:23.705]  But in the process of putting us into that, it automatically dumbs us down and destroys the civilization they live in as well.
[00:57:24.025 --> 00:57:31.949]  So it's almost like cheating by the establishment, is that it is so set up at the top, but they don't run all the chaos.
[00:57:32.650 --> 00:57:36.332]  They more like steer it and manipulate it and then have learned how to guide it.
[00:57:37.672 --> 00:57:38.953]  In what way are they guiding it?
[00:57:40.191 --> 00:57:46.636]  Is it possible that it's just capitalizing on flaws in human nature, flaws in our society?
[00:57:46.996 --> 00:57:49.298]  There's already major flaws and major currents.
[00:57:49.318 --> 00:57:53.942]  It's like Caesar said, there's a tide in the affairs of men, but take up the flood of these onto fortune.
[00:57:54.577 --> 00:57:55.597]  And so, yes.
[00:57:56.177 --> 00:58:00.018]  And so they're basically, they're basically surfing, surfing this.
[00:58:00.038 --> 00:58:02.019]  So I agree with you, it is this big chaos theory.
[00:58:02.319 --> 00:58:04.119]  It's out of control, but they know people.
[00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:07.240]  It always drives me crazy with all this Illuminati shit.
[00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:16.262]  How do I know it's just one crazy old, you know, like Howard Hunt type dude, who's like writing a bunch of wacky shit.
[00:58:16.803 --> 00:58:19.283]  But what's really going on is not that, he's like a nutty dude.
[00:58:19.363 --> 00:58:20.403]  I'll tell you how we know.
[00:58:21.064 --> 00:58:22.424]  It is a big idea.
[00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:24.671]  A new world order.
[00:58:25.352 --> 00:58:27.634]  We are now facing a common challenge.
[00:58:29.035 --> 00:58:39.325]  And the challenge is how to build a world order for the first time in history on a global basis.
[00:58:39.966 --> 00:58:48.654]  The affirmative task we have now is to actually create a new world order.
[00:58:49.808 --> 00:58:51.849]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:58:51.949 --> 00:58:54.370]  Is it one world, the central bankers in charge?
[00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:57.932]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[00:58:57.972 --> 00:58:58.712]  Of course we are.
[00:58:58.752 --> 00:59:01.433]  We are absolutely slaves to central banks.
[00:59:01.513 --> 00:59:10.377]  There are hundreds of books like Tragedy and Hope and so many others written by the top think tank heads, the Rand Corporation.
[00:59:10.397 --> 00:59:11.678]  What do they believe?
[00:59:11.878 --> 00:59:14.419]  Ecoscience written by the current White House
[00:59:14.719 --> 00:59:16.060]  I think a lot of it does.
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:16.800]  I think a lot of it does.
[00:59:34.335 --> 00:59:36.137]  And so it was actually, a lot of it was out then.
[00:59:36.157 --> 00:59:38.619]  It's just that Snowden released a whole lot more.
[00:59:38.659 --> 00:59:41.761]  But separate from that, what gets you the most excited today?
[00:59:42.822 --> 00:59:44.604]  You just switched gears on me, man.
[00:59:44.624 --> 00:59:46.926]  Microphones and the cable boxes.
[00:59:46.946 --> 00:59:48.868]  The world's doomed, but what gets you happy?
[00:59:50.429 --> 00:59:52.371]  It's fun, Alex Jones.
[00:59:52.591 --> 00:59:55.073]  If you have good friends, you have a good life.
[00:59:55.563 --> 00:59:55.823]  Right?
[00:59:55.843 --> 00:59:58.024]  I mean, isn't that what life is about?
[00:59:58.264 --> 01:00:00.325]  Just enjoying time?
[01:00:00.505 --> 01:00:01.085]  Having a good time?
[01:00:01.345 --> 01:00:02.646]  Alright, alright, getting serious.
[01:00:03.406 --> 01:00:04.086]  Robin Williams.
[01:00:04.307 --> 01:00:05.287]  Oh, that's sad.
[01:00:08.268 --> 01:00:09.048]  It's just sad.
[01:00:09.249 --> 01:00:10.869]  You know, it's sad when anybody has depression.
[01:00:11.529 --> 01:00:20.273]  And when a guy who's so beloved doesn't feel it and kills himself, it seems almost, almost impossibly tragic.
[01:00:21.293 --> 01:00:21.594]  You know?
[01:00:22.234 --> 01:00:22.594]  I met him.
[01:00:23.741 --> 01:00:29.607]  I met Robin Williams at the Hollywood Improv and I didn't know it was him until I was in the middle of talking to him.
[01:00:31.109 --> 01:00:34.893]  I did a show and there was a line of people at the show that were taking pictures.
[01:00:35.732 --> 01:00:44.296]  And I was taking pictures with all these people and this guy comes up and he starts telling me, just being really complimentary, telling me he loved this one bit that I did about dolphins.
[01:00:44.356 --> 01:00:47.998]  And then I'm looking at him and I'm realizing, holy shit, this is Robin Williams.
[01:00:48.578 --> 01:00:50.839]  I thought I was just talking to some guy.
[01:00:51.419 --> 01:00:57.062]  In the middle of talking to him, I'm like, this is what he was... There was no pretense, nothing weird about him.
[01:00:57.142 --> 01:00:58.363]  He's a giant movie star.
[01:00:58.463 --> 01:01:00.564]  He waited in line with all the other people.
[01:01:01.485 --> 01:01:04.028]  And he had a hat on and glasses and I didn't know it was him.
[01:01:04.629 --> 01:01:09.535]  I literally didn't know it was him until he was like two minutes into our conversation.
[01:01:10.756 --> 01:01:11.838]  That you are here.
[01:01:12.899 --> 01:01:15.742]  That life exists and identity.
[01:01:17.344 --> 01:01:20.829]  That the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse.
[01:01:21.542 --> 01:01:25.806]  I'm filming a comedy special next week at the Denver Comedy Works.
[01:01:25.886 --> 01:01:29.990]  This is a club outside of, in Denver rather, downtown.
[01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:33.072]  It's like this amazing small comedy club.
[01:01:33.253 --> 01:01:35.134]  It's like 200 seats, really low ceiling.
[01:01:35.214 --> 01:01:37.056]  It's like real old school comedy club.
[01:01:37.316 --> 01:01:39.258]  Like one of the best clubs in the country.
[01:01:39.398 --> 01:01:40.579]  So I'm super excited about it.
[01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:45.043]  I've only got one or two questions more because you've got to go out there and talk and I appreciate you spending time with the show.
[01:01:45.243 --> 01:01:45.444]  Hey!
[01:01:46.801 --> 01:01:51.523]  I agree and I disagree with you on your chemtrail show, On Conspiracies.
[01:01:51.543 --> 01:01:52.283]  That was a good show.
[01:01:52.303 --> 01:01:54.203]  Are you still doing that show?
[01:01:54.484 --> 01:01:55.444]  No, I don't think so.
[01:01:55.764 --> 01:01:59.825]  We're still talking, but if we do do it, it's going to be in a different way.
[01:02:00.325 --> 01:02:07.668]  There was a problem with that show, and one of the problems is that most of the subjects were kind of...
[01:02:08.976 --> 01:02:14.517]  Like, you know, you're talking to people about UFOs, you're talking to people about Bigfoot, you're hoping that you're going to get some real information.
[01:02:14.617 --> 01:02:14.897]  Oh, yeah.
[01:02:15.117 --> 01:02:25.100]  The reality is, when you start digging into how a lot of these folks think, they have this exorbitant need to believe that those things are true.
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:29.241]  Whether it's UFOs, whether it's Bigfoot, and there's not a lot of critical thinking.
[01:02:29.341 --> 01:02:34.442]  No, no, I agree, but the media only lets you have shows where you cover Bigfoot and Chupacabras.
[01:02:34.482 --> 01:02:36.143]  They often meet some shows like that.
[01:02:36.163 --> 01:02:37.803]  I was on Ventura's show for a while, and
[01:02:38.283 --> 01:02:40.544]  It went to that in the third season, so they basically cancelled it.
[01:02:40.764 --> 01:02:42.004]  So I think that's more of a corporate thing.
[01:02:42.044 --> 01:02:43.165]  But listen, I agree with you.
[01:02:43.185 --> 01:02:46.426]  A lot of the so-called conspiracy culture is BS stuff on purpose.
[01:02:46.926 --> 01:02:48.987]  And most of the chemtrail stuff is bull.
[01:02:49.047 --> 01:02:49.887]  It's ice crystals.
[01:02:50.167 --> 01:02:54.409]  But there are real government programs to geo-engineer and manipulate the weather.
[01:02:54.589 --> 01:02:55.570]  I think you're probably right.
[01:02:55.830 --> 01:02:56.830]  I don't doubt that.
[01:02:57.090 --> 01:02:58.551]  That's not what I doubted at all.
[01:02:59.311 --> 01:02:59.591]  No, I know.
[01:02:59.611 --> 01:03:01.032]  It's just what particular people are saying.
[01:03:01.052 --> 01:03:03.753]  This is a real issue when people are looking at Southwest flights.
[01:03:03.773 --> 01:03:07.534]  They're going back and forth over Burbank Airport, or any airport, and they look at them
[01:03:07.955 --> 01:03:10.658]  And they, you know, they think something is going on.
[01:03:10.838 --> 01:03:12.600]  They think that they're getting sprayed.
[01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:15.582]  They think that the government is spraying them.
[01:03:15.623 --> 01:03:17.825]  They think the NSA is watching them.
[01:03:17.885 --> 01:03:24.451]  What they need to understand is the reality is, no, it's not like a spray that's in the air.
[01:03:24.611 --> 01:03:28.935]  But what's going on is it's jet fuel that's burning in the air.
[01:03:29.436 --> 01:03:32.159]  And to the tone of millions of flights.
[01:03:32.699 --> 01:03:36.423]  I mean, the tune of millions of flights... At the Earth, it is 20% darker than Arkansas.
[01:03:36.924 --> 01:03:38.526]  Yeah, and well, that was one of the things about 9-11.
[01:03:38.546 --> 01:03:39.527]  No, no, I love the show.
[01:03:39.567 --> 01:03:48.938]  I mean, I actually agree with you that there's all these schizophrenics who literally think everything's going on, but then meanwhile, the government's so out of control that then a lot of times, some of it's going on.
[01:03:49.399 --> 01:03:51.722]  So, I mean, I must totally imagine being a schizophrenic now.
[01:03:52.362 --> 01:03:56.866]  When there's just so much crazy, real stuff, and it must just feed the fire.
[01:03:56.886 --> 01:03:58.308]  But I'm sorry, you're talking about 9-11.
[01:03:58.328 --> 01:04:07.156]  Well, I was saying, after 9-11, when they stopped flights, there was this, like, change in the Earth's temperature because of all the fire.
[01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:07.696]  Oh yeah, I remember.
[01:04:07.876 --> 01:04:08.677]  It was madness.
[01:04:09.025 --> 01:04:13.348]  The United States temperature changed in a measurable way because there was no flight.
[01:04:13.649 --> 01:04:16.951]  Because of the artificial clouds that are created, they do alter the temperature.
[01:04:17.312 --> 01:04:24.117]  But what people should be really concerned with is the instances of disease, of lung disease that people have that live near airports.
[01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:24.978]  Oh, it's incredible.
[01:04:24.998 --> 01:04:26.699]  Dude, it's not good at all.
[01:04:26.919 --> 01:04:29.301]  Living near an airport is terrible for you.
[01:04:29.341 --> 01:04:30.662]  That's the real chemtrail.
[01:04:30.943 --> 01:04:32.684]  The real chemtrail is the fuel.
[01:04:32.904 --> 01:04:35.206]  Yeah, it's not that there's sprays in the sky.
[01:04:35.266 --> 01:04:36.708]  A lot of them don't like to land heavy.
[01:04:36.728 --> 01:04:38.690]  The big secret is they start dumping fuels.
[01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:39.251]  You know that.
[01:04:39.271 --> 01:04:39.451]  Yeah.
[01:04:39.831 --> 01:04:40.912]  I mean, it is crazy.
[01:04:41.132 --> 01:04:43.455]  Well, it's also, I mean, they...
[01:04:44.159 --> 01:04:49.760]  Most, look, there have been all sorts of theories about geoengineering, of how to accomplish it.
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:54.361]  There's been all sorts of discussion about what to do if the hole in the ozone layer gets bigger.
[01:04:54.381 --> 01:05:05.484]  Many, many scientists have come up with what they think are theories or partial solutions or ideas for future concepts that could be a solution someday when technology reaches that certain point.
[01:05:05.584 --> 01:05:06.344]  Space layers.
[01:05:07.705 --> 01:05:11.070]  To think that they have it would be silly.
[01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:12.853]  Why wouldn't they think about those things?
[01:05:12.873 --> 01:05:14.636]  Why wouldn't they study those things?
[01:05:15.057 --> 01:05:17.000]  It's just, how much of it are we actually seeing?
[01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:20.145]  When you're seeing all these things that people think are artificial clouds,
[01:05:21.676 --> 01:05:27.337]  If you call, if you think that that's the government spraying, the problem is you f***ed up the real conspiracies.
[01:05:27.897 --> 01:05:35.098]  When you have something that is simple and disprovable, like just the fact that jets cause condensation.
[01:05:35.619 --> 01:05:39.319]  Condensation in the air, rather, goes through these jets and it creates artificial clouds.
[01:05:39.419 --> 01:05:39.699]  Sure.
[01:05:39.739 --> 01:05:48.801]  Like it's been proven that... Be honest, what did you think when I first mentioned, like in 1998 here at Cap City Comedy Club, some mutual friends brought me down here and we hung out and had dinner and stuff and had fun.
[01:05:49.341 --> 01:05:54.002]  What did you think when I was saying a lot of, you know, wild stuff then versus now, the police state?
[01:05:54.022 --> 01:05:55.422]  You were way ahead of your time.
[01:05:55.442 --> 01:05:56.682]  I don't know what you're saying.
[01:05:56.742 --> 01:05:58.443]  You were so far ahead of your time.
[01:05:58.483 --> 01:06:02.103]  This is what, you know, look, are you a paranoid guy?
[01:06:04.144 --> 01:06:05.364]  Yes, you're a little paranoid.
[01:06:05.684 --> 01:06:05.884]  But?
[01:06:06.144 --> 01:06:06.884]  You write a lot.
[01:06:07.824 --> 01:06:14.765]  And you were right about them using military tactics for the police in the 90s.
[01:06:14.825 --> 01:06:17.306]  You were talking about how one day it's going to be like Tiananmen Square.
[01:06:17.326 --> 01:06:18.646]  They're going to roll tanks out.
[01:06:19.403 --> 01:06:21.104]  And I remember thinking, how crazy is he?
[01:06:21.124 --> 01:06:25.648]  He thinks they're going to roll tanks, they're going to have military people on the streets in American soil.
[01:06:25.688 --> 01:06:26.868]  That would never happen.
[01:06:27.329 --> 01:06:28.069]  But that's happened.
[01:06:28.810 --> 01:06:34.374]  But I was reading Rand Corporation National Military Stabilization Force quotes.
[01:06:34.861 --> 01:06:38.705]  That's what I'm telling people is that a lot of it isn't just theoretical.
[01:06:39.065 --> 01:06:41.147]  They're planning a global authoritarian system.
[01:06:41.167 --> 01:06:41.988]  It's not even Americans.
[01:06:42.168 --> 01:06:42.828]  It's not the military.
[01:06:42.849 --> 01:06:43.489]  It's not the cops.
[01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:45.671]  It's these global central planners.
[01:06:45.751 --> 01:06:47.973]  But it seems to be there's more police violence.
[01:06:48.013 --> 01:06:52.417]  There was something on one of the websites that had the
[01:06:53.223 --> 01:06:56.324]  Four unarmed men were killed by police this month.
[01:06:56.604 --> 01:06:57.824]  They might have this profile.
[01:06:57.844 --> 01:06:59.785]  These guys were killed by cops.
[01:07:00.585 --> 01:07:03.786]  What about the UC Davis thing, just spraying people in handcuffs?
[01:07:04.166 --> 01:07:05.706]  Remember, you spoke out against that.
[01:07:05.726 --> 01:07:07.367]  Well, they weren't even handcuffs, right?
[01:07:07.427 --> 01:07:08.387]  Weren't they protesting?
[01:07:08.447 --> 01:07:09.387]  Didn't they just block?
[01:07:09.587 --> 01:07:10.807]  Yeah, they sat down on the ground.
[01:07:10.847 --> 01:07:13.468]  Some had already been handcuffed because they wouldn't get up.
[01:07:13.908 --> 01:07:15.168]  So it was torture to get up.
[01:07:15.188 --> 01:07:17.009]  There's a real problem when you
[01:07:17.585 --> 01:07:33.951]  You control people in ways, you know, like if you have a giant system, like the kind of system that we have now, and you control people in ways where everybody can watch, you put on these displays of power, but everybody sees that, and it riles everybody else up.
[01:07:34.752 --> 01:07:39.714]  It's like, you know, when people see a riot, it makes other riots more likely to happen.
[01:07:40.054 --> 01:07:43.495]  It makes the possibility of other riots, and that's one of the things that I think that
[01:07:43.854 --> 01:07:45.795]  The military's totally terrified about it.
[01:07:45.955 --> 01:07:48.335]  Or the police, the militarized.
[01:07:48.375 --> 01:07:50.776]  So why are they pushing tactics that actually incite it?
[01:07:50.816 --> 01:07:52.837]  Because they're trying to scare everybody and they're backing down.
[01:07:52.997 --> 01:07:54.157]  That's the only way they know how.
[01:07:54.257 --> 01:07:58.859]  It's like that old expression, if you only have a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
[01:07:59.319 --> 01:08:02.780]  It's like they're trying to get people to back down and people want blood.
[01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:04.520]  You know, this kid got shot.
[01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:10.062]  The whole thing is like... One of those things where... I may have to go there one day.
[01:08:10.082 --> 01:08:10.702]  Very difficult.
[01:08:10.842 --> 01:08:13.043]  Very difficult to see how they're going to calm everybody down.
[01:08:13.642 --> 01:08:14.063]  We're good to go.
[01:08:29.304 --> 01:08:30.906]  Those are terrible terrible moments.
[01:08:32.068 --> 01:08:37.394]  As the violence ramps up and as the police state ramps up, the two things go together.
[01:08:37.414 --> 01:08:44.003]  That's why I was talking earlier about why is government building more bunkers and billions of rounds of ammo and thousands of armored vehicles and
[01:08:44.603 --> 01:08:46.504]  You know, training to take on the gun owners.
[01:08:46.524 --> 01:08:47.445]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:08:47.465 --> 01:08:51.748]  Can you imagine if the government tries an open gun confiscation program, Joe?
[01:08:52.348 --> 01:08:53.209]  People believe in it.
[01:08:53.249 --> 01:08:54.510]  Some people think it's the right idea.
[01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:59.473]  I've talked to people that are intelligent people that talk to me about Australia.
[01:08:59.713 --> 01:09:03.636]  Australia did something similar and they reduced the amount of gun violence drastically.
[01:09:04.336 --> 01:09:05.977]  But overall muggings and stuff won't help.
[01:09:06.317 --> 01:09:06.618]  Do they?
[01:09:06.918 --> 01:09:07.738]  Yeah, it's just like England.
[01:09:07.758 --> 01:09:08.739]  You ban the guns, yeah.
[01:09:09.179 --> 01:09:10.980]  That stuff goes down, but overall crime goes up.
[01:09:11.241 --> 01:09:13.102]  Well, in closing, what is
[01:09:14.454 --> 01:09:19.876]  Your favorite comedy bit of all time by someone else, and then what is your all favorite of yours?
[01:09:19.996 --> 01:09:25.657]  I don't have a favorite of my own, but my favorite of all time... It would have to be Sam Kinison.
[01:09:26.218 --> 01:09:29.119]  I worked at this place called the Boston Athletic Club.
[01:09:29.159 --> 01:09:30.899]  This is before I ever thought about being a comic.
[01:09:30.999 --> 01:09:32.139]  I was probably like 19 years old.
[01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:39.962]  And I was working at this place, and there was this chick behind the counter that was my friend, and she was going on about this Sam Kinison guy.
[01:09:40.322 --> 01:09:42.243]  I saw Sam Kinison on HBO.
[01:09:42.343 --> 01:09:43.703]  Oh my God, it was so funny!
[01:09:44.028 --> 01:09:48.198]  She goes, he did this bit about, so she did the bit.
[01:09:48.319 --> 01:09:49.742]  She did the Kinison bit for me.
[01:09:50.003 --> 01:09:51.507]  She got down on the ground.
[01:09:52.114 --> 01:09:54.035]  And did the whole bit, it never ends!
[01:09:54.315 --> 01:09:55.175]  It never ends!
[01:09:55.395 --> 01:09:56.155]  Help!
[01:09:56.175 --> 01:09:56.255]  Help!
[01:09:56.315 --> 01:09:58.676]  So she's doing that in the parking lot.
[01:09:58.756 --> 01:10:01.177]  She is doing an impression of Sam Kinison.
[01:10:01.457 --> 01:10:03.457]  She was yelling out the bit.
[01:10:04.018 --> 01:10:06.478]  And so I went, God, I gotta see this.
[01:10:06.798 --> 01:10:09.899]  So I went out and got a VHS copy of it.
[01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:12.560]  I saw it, or somehow or another, I watched it.
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:14.681]  Did that almost spur you into wanting to be in comedy?
[01:10:14.781 --> 01:10:18.222]  It was the first time that I ever thought that I could be a comedian.
[01:10:18.582 --> 01:10:21.004]  Not because I was, like, as good as him or anything like that.
[01:10:21.104 --> 01:10:23.965]  What it made me realize is, like, oh, that's comedy, too!
[01:10:24.846 --> 01:10:28.248]  Like, comedy is not just those guys that I love watching on Evening of the Improv.
[01:10:28.268 --> 01:10:29.709]  We used to love Evening of the Improv.
[01:10:30.029 --> 01:10:36.152]  Like, they would have all those shows, and the guys would get out there in their blazers, and they would say something really funny, and then the next guy would come up, and he would do the same thing.
[01:10:36.393 --> 01:10:38.014]  And they all had, like, sort of a similar path.
[01:10:38.434 --> 01:10:39.154]  I really loved it.
[01:10:39.414 --> 01:10:43.417]  Like, I was a big Jerry Seinfeld fan, and I loved, uh, you know,
[01:10:44.217 --> 01:10:46.219]  There's so many great comics from that time.
[01:10:46.319 --> 01:10:48.041]  Richard Jenney, he was a big Richard Jenney fan.
[01:10:48.341 --> 01:10:51.444]  But out of nowhere, this Sam Kinsey guy comes along.
[01:10:51.844 --> 01:10:53.205]  And I saw what he was doing.
[01:10:53.625 --> 01:11:02.033]  He had a t-shirt on, it was a cut t-shirt, and he had a long coat on, like a trench coat, and a backwards fedora.
[01:11:02.433 --> 01:11:04.575]  Not a fedora, but one of those Kango hats.
[01:11:05.154 --> 01:11:07.916]  And I remember watching it, watching him do it, and I was like, wow.
[01:11:08.156 --> 01:11:08.796]  Is he your favorite?
[01:11:09.557 --> 01:11:10.297]  He's my favorite.
[01:11:10.357 --> 01:11:11.098]  For one year.
[01:11:11.418 --> 01:11:13.860]  I think for one year, Kinnison was the greatest comic ever.
[01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:14.580]  I think in 1986.
[01:11:16.241 --> 01:11:23.586]  But I think he's also a cautionary tale because he's such a brilliant comic, but he's so haunted by demons.
[01:11:23.626 --> 01:11:33.152]  Like, you want to listen to, uh, Mark Maron has a fantastic, uh, account of, like, all the times, like, he was hanging out and partying with Kinnison when he was coming up.
[01:11:33.192 --> 01:11:33.973]  He was a young guy.
[01:11:34.366 --> 01:11:38.910]  And he worked at the Comedy Store, and he did Blow with Kinnison, and they told coke-crazy stories.
[01:11:39.170 --> 01:11:43.934]  Mark said that they did so much coke that he heard voices in his head for a year.
[01:11:45.015 --> 01:11:45.415]  Wow!
[01:11:45.555 --> 01:11:46.696]  Which is crazy.
[01:11:47.197 --> 01:11:48.918]  And it took its toll.
[01:11:48.938 --> 01:11:49.939]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:11:49.959 --> 01:11:53.562]  It took its toll on his performances, on his comedy itself.
[01:11:53.942 --> 01:11:58.526]  Because I think in that first year, before he became like Sam Kinnison, the megastar,
[01:11:59.130 --> 01:12:04.394]  He was hungry, and he was creative, and he was doing a lot of really groundbreaking stuff.
[01:12:04.474 --> 01:12:12.300]  I mean, there's some people that think that, you know, some of it was like misogynistic, or homophobic, and you know, there's good points to be made.
[01:12:12.861 --> 01:12:13.701]  But it's real, so what?
[01:12:13.741 --> 01:12:14.322]  It's comedy!
[01:12:14.382 --> 01:12:15.262]  But there's points to be made.
[01:12:15.282 --> 01:12:18.665]  That's tyranny, John, telling people not to sell dirty jokes, or funny jokes, or cultural jokes.
[01:12:18.685 --> 01:12:22.228]  Well, I think there's points to be made like that in other art forms, too.
[01:12:22.308 --> 01:12:23.128]  In movies, too.
[01:12:23.209 --> 01:12:28.933]  I mean, there's funny movies, there's great movies that show, you know, horrible things that you really shouldn't do to people.
[01:12:29.403 --> 01:12:30.965]  But they're great in movie form.
[01:12:31.405 --> 01:12:32.646]  You know who else is a great comic?
[01:12:33.187 --> 01:12:34.228]  And I'm here to see him tonight.
[01:12:34.528 --> 01:12:35.529]  It's Joe Rogan.
[01:12:35.709 --> 01:12:37.030]  He's coming up in mere minutes.
[01:12:37.351 --> 01:12:38.532]  This is, we've got show business.
[01:12:38.992 --> 01:12:40.353]  Alright, well thanks for the time, man.
[01:12:40.393 --> 01:12:40.934]  You're awesome.
[01:12:41.014 --> 01:12:41.935]  That was a great interview.
[01:12:41.955 --> 01:12:44.617]  InfoWars.com, plug your websites.
[01:12:44.998 --> 01:12:47.040]  JoeRogan.net, InfoWars.com.
[01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:48.041]  That's it.
[01:12:48.241 --> 01:12:50.683]  And the podcast with, I mean, the Joe Rogan experience.
[01:12:50.703 --> 01:12:51.724]  You get it on iTunes.
[01:12:52.205 --> 01:12:53.466]  If the Illuminati lets you.
[01:12:54.744 --> 01:12:59.709]  If the black helicopters don't come and take away your f***ing cell phone, you think I'm playing games?
[01:13:00.489 --> 01:13:02.571]  Government-issued boots, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:02.771 --> 01:13:03.992]  Absolutely verifiable.
[01:13:04.152 --> 01:13:05.394]  I've got the documents right here.
[01:13:05.554 --> 01:13:09.257]  We've got close, high-profile, high-resolution photographs.
[01:13:11.739 --> 01:13:12.580]  What's your favorite rock band?
[01:13:14.242 --> 01:13:17.084]  Um... I don't... Skiddard, maybe?
[01:13:28.755 --> 01:13:34.861]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[01:13:34.881 --> 01:13:38.224]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:13:38.324 --> 01:13:39.926]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant!
[01:13:39.966 --> 01:13:46.212]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:13:46.332 --> 01:13:52.238]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[01:13:52.378 --> 01:13:56.120]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.

[01:13:59.402 --> 01:14:07.387]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:14:07.687 --> 01:14:09.728]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:14:09.768 --> 01:14:10.829]  It's a war against the truth.
