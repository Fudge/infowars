[00:00:19.702 --> 00:00:21.663]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.763 --> 00:00:23.024]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.344 --> 00:00:26.846]  It's January 22nd, 2014, and here's a look at tonight's show.
[00:00:28.927 --> 00:00:32.929]  Tonight, has the infamous hacker, Guccifer, been caught in Romania?
[00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:37.751]  Is this the year the machines invade the human workforce in record numbers?
[00:00:39.052 --> 00:00:44.595]  We call Telly Blackwood to talk about his alleged encounter with a TSA rep regarding his contest submission.
[00:00:46.015 --> 00:00:48.997]  All this and more on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:54.574 --> 00:00:55.214]  And welcome back.
[00:00:55.475 --> 00:00:56.975]  We'll lead off our night with this.
[00:00:57.316 --> 00:01:05.080]  Police in Romania are saying that they have caught Guccifer, the legendary hacker who allegedly hacked the likes of Colin Powell and also Tony Blair.
[00:01:05.501 --> 00:01:08.482]  They're saying that the suspect's name is Marcel Leighill.
[00:01:09.203 --> 00:01:14.946]  He was allegedly contacted in the Romanian city of Arad, but we'll give you more information as it develops.
[00:01:16.187 --> 00:01:19.829]  LAPD stood down for minutes before TSA's shooting.
[00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:22.650]  Now this is the situation at LAX with the shooting out there.
[00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:37.657]  LAPD officers assigned to the area, while Paul Ciancia began his shooting spree targeting TSA agents at LAX airport, stood down minutes before the attack began, leaving for breaks without informing their dispatcher as required.
[00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:43.280]  Departmental procedures require that officers notify a dispatcher before going on break.
[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:56.509]  So it seems like a whole lot of laxed security at your nation's airport, because not only that, but we showed you the stories of the Muslim Brotherhood being able to be waived, just walk straight through TSA security without a screening.
[00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:05.215]  And not just this, but when you want to talk about stand downs, we also saw the stand down at the Navy Yard shooting where the SWAT team did not intercept the culprit there.
[00:02:05.755 --> 00:02:07.617]  So back to the airports, whether it's
[00:02:08.417 --> 00:02:16.520]  You know, your Navy Yard shootings, whether it's the LAX airport, whatever it is, this notion that the government is always going to be there to protect you is just not true.
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:26.603]  Because you see this situation, you see the LAX shootings, anything else that's going on, even the shooting, excuse me, not the shooting, but the incident with the underwear bomber, it wasn't the government that stopped that.
[00:02:26.704 --> 00:02:33.386]  It was the proactive people on that plane who jumped on the guy and stopped him from, you know, blowing up the plane with his firecracker or whatever it was.
[00:02:33.906 --> 00:02:39.008]  So just be aware of that, protect yourself, do what you can because the government won't always be there to save you.
[00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:44.411]  And speaking of the government not being there to save you, what if the government shows up with excessive force?
[00:02:44.851 --> 00:02:48.252]  Utah police obtained grenade launchers, riot gear from feds.
[00:02:48.593 --> 00:02:53.475]  Now these police are not to be confused with the ones from North Dakota who use drones to catch cattle thieves.
[00:02:53.815 --> 00:03:00.498]  Also not to be confused with the campus police at Ohio State University who use armored cars to, I guess, bust up frat parties.
[00:03:01.158 --> 00:03:17.703]  For the past five years, the Pentagon has equipped dozens of Utah police departments with a wide variety of military equipment, commonly used in riot responses such as the aforementioned grenade launchers, M-14s, M-16s, and mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles.
[00:03:18.223 --> 00:03:19.044]  The article goes on.
[00:03:19.944 --> 00:03:24.787]  Several of the sheriffs indicated that the equipment would only be used in worst-case scenarios.
[00:03:25.107 --> 00:03:29.769]  Well, that makes me feel a whole lot better that they're saving their grenade launchers for a worst-case scenario.
[00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:42.276]  Because, as you may recall, one of my first reports when I started working here at InfoWars was about the police in Colorado, Colorado Springs, who use full-on body armor riot gear for the most routine and mundane of calls.
[00:03:42.316 --> 00:03:46.899]  You get a call, you know, some kids out there tagging the school buses or the billboards.
[00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:51.943]  You know, send Judge Dredd out there in his full combat gear to bust up these kids and, you know, put them in their place.
[00:03:52.383 --> 00:03:56.546]  So at least the police here are saying that they're going to use these in the worst case scenarios.
[00:03:57.166 --> 00:04:01.549]  And I'm not, you know, discounting the fact that these things shoot grenades.
[00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.132]  Because people will say, well, you don't always have to shoot a grenade out of a grenade launcher.
[00:04:05.152 --> 00:04:06.833]  You can shoot smoke grenades.
[00:04:06.853 --> 00:04:08.554]  You can shoot other type of grenades.
[00:04:08.574 --> 00:04:10.616]  They don't always have to be fragment grenades.
[00:04:10.656 --> 00:04:14.659]  But I'm not discounting the fact that these things could potentially shoot that type of ordnance.
[00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:16.080]  And it does very much concern me.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.662]  And it concerns me because I see things like this.
[00:04:19.082 --> 00:04:19.682]  War zone.
[00:04:20.043 --> 00:04:23.225]  Open street battles in Kyiv as rioters police face off.
[00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:31.371]  Riot police brutally dispersed radical protesters from central Kyiv in the largest operation since the latest outbreak of violence.
[00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:35.154]  Almost 200 officers have been injured over four days of scuffles.
[00:04:35.534 --> 00:04:38.036]  Two people were reportedly killed amid the crisis.
[00:04:38.576 --> 00:04:42.920]  And this is a preview of what could happen in this country if the economy continues to worsen.
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.264]  Because it's not just economic factors, but the economy definitely played a role in this Kiev incident.
[00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:55.050]  But, you know, think about all the things that could happen just here in the States, because you have the dollar devaluation, you have the fiat currency.
[00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:01.195]  So if things get bad enough, if this stuff really hits the fan, how long will it be before America looks like this?
[00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:05.639]  And we can get to that situation sooner than we anticipated, because now we ask this question.
[00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:09.062]  It's 2014, the year that a robot will take your job.
[00:05:09.443 --> 00:05:14.107]  The job-o-pocalypse is set to strike as droids are trained to flip burgers.
[00:05:14.808 --> 00:05:25.780]  Experts are predicting a job-o-pocalypse as robots take over manual jobs, while scientists at Cambridge warn that machines should have their intelligence limited to stop them from outsmarting us.
[00:05:26.417 --> 00:05:30.420]  It's not just working at the burger joint at McDonald's or Wendy's or anyplace else.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.621]  They're also replacing the servicemen.
[00:05:32.701 --> 00:05:34.322]  Of course, you know about the drones in the sky.
[00:05:34.642 --> 00:05:43.328]  You also have the RoboCod, the COD, the drone of the seas, and also these land-walking robots straight out of a Star Wars movie being developed by DARPA.
[00:05:43.348 --> 00:05:45.009]  So it's all coming to a head.
[00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:53.334]  They don't want you, they don't need you in the future, and it's one thing to replace something like Blockbuster with a Redbox, but do you really want to be serviced
[00:05:53.814 --> 00:05:54.014]  I think?
[00:06:24.154 --> 00:06:26.095]  I'm like, well this is a place to get to concealed carry.
[00:06:26.115 --> 00:06:27.335]  He's like, yeah, but you got to do it online.
[00:06:27.875 --> 00:06:32.177]  And I didn't say it to the guy, but I'm thinking, I'm like, what are you going to do in like two years when they replace you with a pod?
[00:06:32.197 --> 00:06:33.798]  You're going to be the next Obama pod.
[00:06:33.818 --> 00:06:35.478]  You're going to be a red box in two years, bro.
[00:06:35.838 --> 00:06:37.479]  And I'm not saying this to down the guy.
[00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:40.300]  I really felt bad for this guy that he's not going to have a job.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:46.862]  But if you do these things where somebody shows up and all you do is say, go fill it out online, then what do they need you for?
[00:06:47.242 --> 00:06:51.063]  These guys will end up on food stamps just like this record.
[00:06:51.403 --> 00:06:53.044]  20% of households on food stamps in 2013.
[00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:55.104]  And it's not just that.
[00:06:55.464 --> 00:07:07.568]  The numbers also show that there was a record number of individuals on food stamps in 2013, and that the cost of the program, that being the SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, was at an all-time high.
[00:07:08.408 --> 00:07:15.718]  So you have a record number of individuals on food stamps and also the cost steadily rising to be on the program.
[00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:21.767]  So I don't understand why people can't understand that you don't want to be dependent on the government.
[00:07:22.107 --> 00:07:25.232]  Ask all the people who were dependent on the government during Hurricane Katrina
[00:07:25.572 --> 00:07:29.993]  When they were in the Superdome and waiting for water to be there, did they enjoy being dependent on the government?
[00:07:30.233 --> 00:07:31.233]  But you say that was Bush.
[00:07:31.393 --> 00:07:39.155]  Okay, what about this current administration, Michelle Obama, trying to tell your kids what they can and cannot eat by her active program or whatever it's called.
[00:07:39.475 --> 00:07:46.276]  And the kids at these high schools who are actually in school put out viral YouTube videos, you can find them yourself, talking about how they're hungry.
[00:07:46.296 --> 00:07:47.116]  Kids are passing out.
[00:07:47.456 --> 00:07:50.377]  The jocks are saying they don't have enough to eat to go out and play the football game.
[00:07:50.657 --> 00:07:52.838]  It's just a big mess all the way around.
[00:07:52.878 --> 00:07:54.058]  So yeah, that's what you're going to have.
[00:07:54.838 --> 00:07:55.118]  I think so.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.141]  We're good to go.
[00:08:29.457 --> 00:08:36.439]  Not only that, people are killing themselves in China by not only breathing this, but you go to the Foxconn factories in China, people are jumping off.
[00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:40.500]  They had to put suicide nets out there to stop this from going any further.
[00:08:40.881 --> 00:08:45.322]  So if you're on the West Coast, you have just the general West Coast.
[00:08:45.902 --> 00:08:46.362]  Yes, we are.
[00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:08.371]  Meanwhile, they're getting their preparation for themselves, getting their iodine and so forth.
[00:09:08.671 --> 00:09:09.912]  And they're, you know, on the low.
[00:09:09.932 --> 00:09:15.833]  They're out there testing the kelp and the other things out there, trying to find out why the starfish are melting and dying.
[00:09:16.073 --> 00:09:16.993]  But they don't want to tell you.
[00:09:17.033 --> 00:09:23.415]  They don't want to put any signs on these beaches telling you that these beaches have, or at least one of the beaches, has radiation levels.
[00:09:23.695 --> 00:09:24.135]  I think so.
[00:09:49.414 --> 00:09:54.117]  Now, to take care of something else, we're taking care of business in the form of bitcoins.
[00:09:54.417 --> 00:09:59.660]  Now, a couple of casinos in Las Vegas are accepting bitcoins, but you can't use them for gambling, at least yet.
[00:10:00.041 --> 00:10:04.183]  So if you're a fan of bitcoin, just keep an eye on the situation and maybe you can use it one day.
[00:10:04.223 --> 00:10:07.365]  Not encouraging gambling, just saying that's what the current situation is.
[00:10:07.645 --> 00:10:09.286]  And now we'll end tonight with a shocker.
[00:10:09.466 --> 00:10:13.309]  Mainstream media is now reporting on non-GMO shopping.
[00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:15.732]  FDA approved of all of these things.
[00:10:15.792 --> 00:10:21.022]  This is saying these are safe, there is no health risk, and these are good to use to improve the food supply.
[00:10:21.465 --> 00:10:27.031]  And I don't agree with everything that lady said, but I'm glad that they're at least talking about GMOs on mainstream TV.
[00:10:27.351 --> 00:10:30.194]  Now stay tuned because after this break we'll show you a special report.
[00:10:30.555 --> 00:10:34.879]  I went out in the streets and talked to people about the TSA leaving the airport, so you don't want to miss that.
[00:10:35.239 --> 00:10:42.827]  And also David Knight will talk to Telly Blackwood, an independent filmmaker, about his encounter, alleged encounter, with a TSA agent who called him on the phone.
[00:10:42.847 --> 00:10:44.049]  So stay tuned for both of those.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.241]  Introducing Pro-1.

[00:10:58.144 --> 00:11:02.527]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.

[00:11:08.791 --> 00:11:19.578]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[00:11:19.798 --> 00:11:22.460]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates.

[00:11:56.377 --> 00:12:05.380]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:13.702]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:12:13.862 --> 00:12:18.584]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:39.573]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.

[00:13:11.764 --> 00:13:14.645]  Gropings, detention pods, and x-ray scanners.
[00:13:15.005 --> 00:13:17.586]  A few of the things you can experience at your local airport.
[00:13:17.887 --> 00:13:21.608]  But how would you feel if these things left the airport and came to meet you?
[00:13:21.628 --> 00:13:22.949]  Hi, how are you guys doing?
[00:13:23.369 --> 00:13:25.810]  How do you guys feel about the security at the airport since 9-11?
[00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.171]  We're not interested in talking about it.
[00:13:29.511 --> 00:13:29.752]  Okay.
[00:13:32.413 --> 00:13:37.335]  You do know that it's coming outside of the airport, sir, and it's going to have TSA Viper team down the streets and at the Super Bowl?
[00:13:38.345 --> 00:13:42.627]  Alright, this guy loves the fact that they'll be checking him at the Super Bowl.
[00:13:42.828 --> 00:13:44.088]  He gave me a big thumbs up.
[00:13:44.308 --> 00:13:46.349]  It's kind of annoying, in a sense.
[00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:47.310]  In what way?
[00:13:49.511 --> 00:13:51.092]  Having to get naked, you know what I mean?
[00:13:54.265 --> 00:13:55.326]  Get the pat-downs and all that?
[00:13:55.486 --> 00:13:58.048]  Yeah, and having to put your hands in the air and do all that good stuff.
[00:13:58.108 --> 00:14:03.652]  Well, you know at the Super Bowls they're starting to do pat-downs, you know, TSA-style pat-downs when you go into these big events.
[00:14:03.692 --> 00:14:07.995]  These say travel light because there will be numerous checkpoints throughout the entire week.
[00:14:08.096 --> 00:14:09.036]  It's not going to bother me.
[00:14:09.096 --> 00:14:11.358]  I'll be watching it from my sofa at home.
[00:14:11.638 --> 00:14:16.602]  I don't really like to go to big events like that for those particular reasons because I'm scared of something.
[00:14:16.942 --> 00:14:18.503]  That's a lot of people, you know what I mean?
[00:14:18.523 --> 00:14:20.565]  So anything can happen with all those people there.
[00:14:21.223 --> 00:14:23.945]  How do you guys feel about the security at the airport since 9-11?
[00:14:25.746 --> 00:14:27.807]  It's getting more friendly with TSA PreCheck.
[00:14:28.708 --> 00:14:29.128]  And you, sir?
[00:14:30.248 --> 00:14:30.789]  Yeah, I agree.
[00:14:30.869 --> 00:14:32.190]  I'm a frequent traveler.
[00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:35.412]  I'm TSA PreCheck, so it doesn't really affect me too much.
[00:14:35.672 --> 00:14:37.073]  They have TSA Viper teams.
[00:14:37.093 --> 00:14:40.935]  They're going to be checking bus terminals and airports, some areas they're already doing this.
[00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:42.476]  I don't know.
[00:14:42.496 --> 00:14:43.657]  I might feel safer, actually.
[00:14:44.117 --> 00:14:47.159]  They check bus terminals and also train stations.
[00:14:47.619 --> 00:14:48.539]  No, but I got to go.
[00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:49.640]  Thank you, sir.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:50.561]  You go to the mall?
[00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:56.654]  Okay, so would you be willing to accept anything that goes on here to get inside the mall?
[00:14:58.696 --> 00:14:58.936]  No.
[00:14:59.977 --> 00:15:01.818]  I wouldn't go through a pat-down to go to the mall, no.
[00:15:02.359 --> 00:15:04.321]  So they're on the buses, they're on the trains.
[00:15:04.661 --> 00:15:08.684]  What if a day came when you got a random checkpoint and there's the TSA wanting to check your car?
[00:15:08.724 --> 00:15:10.245]  Would you feel okay with that?
[00:15:12.779 --> 00:15:13.359]  I think so.
[00:15:13.499 --> 00:15:20.684]  Tennessee is now the first state ever to work with the TSA to deploy a simultaneous counter-terrorism operation statewide.
[00:15:21.024 --> 00:15:25.226]  What if, for some reason, they decide maybe they want to do random checkpoints and check you in your car?
[00:15:25.286 --> 00:15:35.252]  You know, this was a massive operation, really bringing all federal, state, and local agencies together to not only do random searches, but also create an army of agents on wheels.
[00:15:35.492 --> 00:15:39.015]  Would you guys be okay with that, if they had a random TSA checkpoint to search your car?
[00:15:39.695 --> 00:15:41.096]  Well, that's happened to me at other
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.401]  Airports like in Los Angeles.
[00:15:43.961 --> 00:15:47.824]  Your vehicle has been inspected under the TSA regulations.
[00:15:48.464 --> 00:15:49.145]  In L.A.
[00:15:49.165 --> 00:15:51.046]  they do it all the time.
[00:15:51.106 --> 00:15:52.867]  You guys had the incident at the L.A.
[00:15:52.947 --> 00:15:53.587]  airport, right?
[00:15:53.667 --> 00:15:55.048]  That was just a couple months ago.
[00:15:56.429 --> 00:15:59.491]  And do you think any additional security could have ended that?
[00:16:00.151 --> 00:16:05.635]  Having someone there who was armed with more than just a walkie-talkie or whatever.
[00:16:07.276 --> 00:16:07.977]  Less crowds.
[00:16:08.878 --> 00:16:09.158]  L.A.'
[00:16:09.138 --> 00:16:09.819]  's a madhouse.
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.823]  What if, you know, the day came when they started doing random checkpoints?
[00:16:12.843 --> 00:16:14.505]  You're driving in your car and you get pulled over.
[00:16:14.545 --> 00:16:16.006]  It's TSA 1 to check your car.
[00:16:16.667 --> 00:16:18.629]  No, not for probable cause.
[00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:21.413]  Well, what's the probable cause here at the airport?
[00:16:21.997 --> 00:16:29.541]  I mean, it's not a probable cause at the airport, but it's a little bit dangerous when you're getting on a plane and now nobody can no longer get to you.
[00:16:29.561 --> 00:16:31.242]  You cannot get to anybody else.
[00:16:31.282 --> 00:16:36.646]  You know, if I'm in my car, you don't have a reason for me to just search my personal space.
[00:16:36.946 --> 00:16:38.046]  You know what I mean?
[00:16:38.066 --> 00:16:39.807]  So you have rights, Fourth Amendment rights?
[00:16:40.468 --> 00:16:40.628]  Yeah.
[00:16:41.656 --> 00:16:51.002]  Good, bad or indifferent, whether they love it or hate it, the people we spoke to today are at least content to put up with these measures at the airport, trading their liberty for security.

[00:18:21.441 --> 00:18:28.671]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:18:28.831 --> 00:18:32.016]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:18:32.176 --> 00:18:33.958]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:18:34.198 --> 00:18:38.784]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:18:38.864 --> 00:18:41.627]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:47.574]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:18:47.734 --> 00:18:51.195]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[00:18:51.395 --> 00:18:56.457]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.

[00:19:23.211 --> 00:19:23.751]  What's your question?
[00:19:23.791 --> 00:19:24.271]  How can I help you?
[00:19:24.471 --> 00:19:29.452]  Okay, well, question one I'd like to ask is what exactly was the purpose for that video?
[00:19:29.533 --> 00:19:30.213]  What is it for?
[00:19:31.093 --> 00:19:32.713]  It was just a comical parody video.
[00:19:33.493 --> 00:19:48.297]  I've been doing parody videos for a long time, and I'm interested in the subject of TSA groping and floundering, which has been in the papers and news and YouTube all over the place, so I decided to exercise my First Amendment right and made a funny video.
[00:19:49.505 --> 00:19:49.905]  That's all?
[00:19:50.685 --> 00:19:56.427]  The second question is why would you do such a video comparing our hard workers to Nazis and Adolf Hitler?
[00:19:57.668 --> 00:20:06.371]  Well, you guys are kind of dictator-like and tell people if they make jokes about the TSA you're going to arrest them and, you know, there's plenty of video out there.
[00:20:06.391 --> 00:20:11.653]  I mean, no disrespect, there's plenty of video out there showing you guys doing all this crap, grabbing grannies and kids.
[00:20:11.673 --> 00:20:12.393]  Are you serious?
[00:20:13.313 --> 00:20:17.855]  My concerns are our workers are being portrayed as criminals when they're here to protect us from terrorists.
[00:20:18.669 --> 00:20:20.190]  They do that on a daily basis.
[00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:24.872]  And how many terrorists have you guys caught since day one of this program?
[00:20:25.793 --> 00:20:32.877]  It's our main focus of our department to hunt terrorists and look for them on every situation we can find.
[00:20:33.869 --> 00:20:34.730]  And how many have you found?
[00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:35.950]  You haven't found any.
[00:20:36.391 --> 00:20:40.513]  Tell me how many numbers, how many terrorists have you stopped from doing any kind of plots against America?
[00:20:41.093 --> 00:20:44.936]  Since the PSA... We've found potential terrorists every day in airports all across the world.
[00:20:45.116 --> 00:20:45.436]  Really?
[00:20:45.476 --> 00:20:46.096]  What, Americans?
[00:20:46.136 --> 00:20:47.517]  Many workers have already seen them.
[00:20:47.857 --> 00:20:50.799]  They've already seen your video and find it very offensive.
[00:20:50.839 --> 00:20:52.960]  And our workers have families with children, sir.
[00:20:53.681 --> 00:20:54.021]  Really?
[00:20:54.101 --> 00:20:57.043]  How would you feel about it if one of their kids came across your video?
[00:20:58.475 --> 00:21:01.518]  Um... People that look like their parents groping people.
[00:21:01.878 --> 00:21:03.379]  Well, that really happens.
[00:21:03.399 --> 00:21:07.942]  They can go onto YouTube and type in TSA groping and hundreds of videos will come up.
[00:21:07.983 --> 00:21:11.025]  Why does mine spark your attention so much?
[00:21:11.872 --> 00:21:12.292]  Are you serious?
[00:21:12.312 --> 00:21:12.992]  Defamation of character?
[00:21:13.012 --> 00:21:14.453]  You guys are a bunch of child molest and criminal perverts.
[00:21:14.473 --> 00:21:15.393]  Go ahead and take me to court.
[00:21:15.413 --> 00:21:15.613]  Go to hell.
[00:21:15.633 --> 00:21:16.893]  I don't give a crap.
[00:21:16.913 --> 00:21:17.813]  Do what you gotta do.
[00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:35.680]  We're prepared to take action if you don't comply by this.
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:36.440]  Yeah, I bet.
[00:21:36.481 --> 00:21:40.624]  If you don't comply, they're going to take some serious action, I'm telling you.
[00:21:41.065 --> 00:21:45.769]  Wow, are they going to go extra deep and full cavity search at me at the airport next time I come there, or what?
[00:21:45.789 --> 00:21:49.772]  You can say whatever you want, but you can put your name flagged when traveling the airwaves.
[00:21:50.113 --> 00:21:50.733]  Oh, wow.
[00:21:50.873 --> 00:21:55.898]  I'm going to take the train anyway because I don't want to get groped by you perverts anyway, so you go ahead and do what you got to do.
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:03.905]  Well that was a response to an entry in our We Will Resist NSA and TSA Tyranny contest.
[00:22:04.365 --> 00:22:07.208]  Now that entrant was Tully Leatherface Blackwood.
[00:22:07.628 --> 00:22:10.751]  He also was an entrant into the Operation Paul Revere contest.
[00:22:11.292 --> 00:22:12.573]  And he got into a lot of trouble.
[00:22:12.613 --> 00:22:15.876]  It caused him a lot of problems with his off-the-hook TV YouTube channel.
[00:22:16.217 --> 00:22:20.581]  So we want to talk to him about that phone call and about his entries and his past experience.
[00:22:20.601 --> 00:22:21.662]  What he thinks is behind this.
[00:22:23.271 --> 00:22:24.051]  Welcome back, Telly.
[00:22:24.531 --> 00:22:27.793]  It's been an interesting time every time you get involved in a contest.
[00:22:27.833 --> 00:22:28.673]  Now we've got another one.
[00:22:29.153 --> 00:22:36.916]  We'll talk about that other contest and all the aftermath that came out of that, but tell us briefly what happened with this phone call from somebody claiming that he was with the TSA.
[00:22:37.856 --> 00:22:41.357]  Well, briefly, the day before, I had received a phone call.
[00:22:41.977 --> 00:22:45.999]  I was actually up in the hills at my buddy's house, and it was the same guy.
[00:22:46.059 --> 00:22:52.061]  His name was John C., and I started sending him some TSA, and he asked some questions for me.
[00:22:53.044 --> 00:22:55.885]  And so I pretty much just, I'm like, I wish I could record this.
[00:22:56.685 --> 00:22:59.686]  So I was like, hey, can you like just call me back tomorrow?
[00:22:59.726 --> 00:23:00.806]  I can't hear you very well.
[00:23:00.826 --> 00:23:01.987]  My reception's terrible.
[00:23:02.887 --> 00:23:04.348]  And he was like, yeah, that'd be fine.
[00:23:04.368 --> 00:23:05.048]  So I'm like, great.
[00:23:06.048 --> 00:23:14.031]  So as soon as I got off the phone, probably a couple hours, within a couple hours, I went ahead and downloaded an application to where I can go ahead and automatically record phone calls.
[00:23:14.551 --> 00:23:16.851]  Then the next day I got the phone call.
[00:23:18.152 --> 00:23:19.612]  Now he said he was with the TSA.
[00:23:19.912 --> 00:23:20.973]  Did he ever give you a name?
[00:23:22.655 --> 00:23:25.036]  When you talked to him, did you get a phone number?
[00:23:25.836 --> 00:23:26.977]  He just said his name was John.
[00:23:27.437 --> 00:23:32.099]  The first time he said his name was John C. The second time around he just said John.
[00:23:32.119 --> 00:23:38.782]  The phone number was a private number so there was no source to show where it was coming from.
[00:23:40.146 --> 00:23:41.087]  Okay, so that was it.
[00:23:41.407 --> 00:24:05.328]  Now, you had a lot of trouble with a previous contest, with the Paul Revere Contest, and in that contest you did a, it was a video, to briefly recap people that hadn't seen it, George Washington sends someone to fetch Michael Moore and Piers Morgan for a kind of waterboarding, and you got some angry pushback from Michael Moore on Twitter, and that went viral, and then after that your YouTube channel got shut down.
[00:24:05.348 --> 00:24:07.010]  Do you think this is related to that in any way?
[00:24:08.166 --> 00:24:09.487]  I don't think it's related.
[00:24:09.847 --> 00:24:12.930]  I pretty much think it's probably the same kind of frustration.
[00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:15.211]  Somebody seeing it felt a little offended.
[00:24:16.112 --> 00:24:22.877]  I can't confirm, you know, or know for sure if that was a TSA person, but the point is they got across.
[00:24:22.957 --> 00:24:28.141]  It's getting a point across and that's the good thing, good part of the goal of this whole video.
[00:24:28.877 --> 00:24:29.617]  That's good.
[00:24:29.657 --> 00:24:39.182]  Now, you know, when it happened before, it was really an amazing Catch-22 situation, and it was a good example when they took your entire channel down and deleted your Gmail account.
[00:24:39.202 --> 00:24:42.024]  It's a good example of what they really want to do to everybody with CISPA.
[00:24:42.344 --> 00:24:53.629]  And that is basically if anyone makes any kind of a claim against you, they would just shut your channel down, shut your website down, whatever, and it's up... the burden of proof is on you to try to get that started again.
[00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:58.152]  And yet, in this situation, you had kind of a Catch-22 where you couldn't even
[00:24:58.852 --> 00:25:00.513]  Yeah, it was a total run-around.
[00:25:00.533 --> 00:25:04.754]  You couldn't really get anything done or get anything accomplished.
[00:25:05.695 --> 00:25:07.996]  It was really a major run-around and a major hassle to get my channel back.
[00:25:22.125 --> 00:25:33.972]  The Muslim Brotherhood was just allowed to pass through, given a VIP pass, even before anybody from their organization was in the government of Egypt, and they just got a pass from TSA.
[00:25:34.512 --> 00:25:44.238]  We see that this is something that really seemed to bother somebody, whether somebody that didn't like you from the previous contest, or somebody who's now a TSA employee, or maybe even the official
[00:25:44.898 --> 00:25:47.420]  Yeah, it's hard to get a response from anybody on anything these days, it seems like.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.041]  I was kind of there at first.
[00:26:11.027 --> 00:26:12.488]  Exactly, what was going on here?
[00:26:12.508 --> 00:26:15.770]  And I was like, oh boy, do I go ahead and play along with this?
[00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:18.852]  Or do I go ahead and just pull off, are you recording me?
[00:26:18.872 --> 00:26:20.574]  And if not, hang up kind of deal?
[00:26:20.954 --> 00:26:22.115]  How do you think they got your number?
[00:26:22.515 --> 00:26:23.656]  Is your number listed?
[00:26:24.756 --> 00:26:26.157]  My number is all over the place.
[00:26:26.317 --> 00:26:29.480]  I was, you know, I'm an actor and been out in the media a lot.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.061]  I never really hid or tried to be much of a private person.
[00:26:32.081 --> 00:26:35.684]  I enjoyed interacting with people and fans and
[00:26:36.602 --> 00:26:41.784]  Even since the Viva La Bam thing in 2004, up to this day I still get calls from fans.
[00:26:41.864 --> 00:26:44.485]  I talk to them and I give them time.
[00:26:44.505 --> 00:26:47.706]  If it weren't for them I wouldn't be where I'm at.
[00:26:48.127 --> 00:27:01.672]  Now you've been a professional wrestler, you've had the Off The Hook TV channel on YouTube, of course that was one that was taken down and inactive for several months so that really damaged you being offline, but are you still going to continue doing that?
[00:27:03.286 --> 00:27:17.253]  We're still doing a little off-the-hook TV videos here and there, but primarily now we're still focusing on the prescription for murder documentary, and we also have a couple other movies, motion pictures, we're actually in plan for filming as well.
[00:27:17.673 --> 00:27:22.756]  Okay, yeah, that's right, you've got a documentary that you're working on that's related to health issues.
[00:27:23.547 --> 00:27:27.188]  Well, thanks for participating in this contest.
[00:27:27.228 --> 00:27:28.428]  We wish you the best of luck.
[00:27:28.488 --> 00:27:34.190]  Your stuff is always controversial, always gets a lot of reactions, and let them see what it looks like for themselves.
[00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:37.651]  And best of luck for that, Telly, and best of luck with your documentary as well.

[00:28:42.813 --> 00:28:47.277]  Well, with flu season in full effect, the push for vaccination is really intense.
[00:28:47.678 --> 00:28:51.681]  But what they might not be telling you is you could be trading one danger for another.
[00:28:52.142 --> 00:29:00.510]  So we went undercover at two of the nation's top walk-in flu shot pharmacies to see what they had to say about the vaccine's safety and effectiveness.
[00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:03.432]  Hello, how are you?
[00:29:03.452 --> 00:29:05.795]  Hi, where do you guys do flu shots?
[00:29:06.898 --> 00:29:11.100]  Do you think that it's safe and effective?
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:14.241]  It's 50-70% effective against it.
[00:29:14.641 --> 00:29:18.062]  If you do get the flu, it'll be a lot less severe.
[00:29:18.322 --> 00:29:24.825]  We had a tech that did get a shot, did come down with it, but it only took her like two days to bounce back.
[00:29:25.325 --> 00:29:27.025]  As you can tell, things are deteriorating.
[00:29:27.125 --> 00:29:28.426]  Is there any advice you can give me?
[00:29:28.586 --> 00:29:30.206]  Don't ever take a flu shot again.
[00:29:30.226 --> 00:29:38.308]  Now, I watched that night with Dr. Oz, and I... We both saw him put that thing in my arm, and within 10 days, I was struck down.
[00:29:38.328 --> 00:29:39.569]  Have you had a flu shot this year?
[00:29:39.749 --> 00:29:40.629]  No, I don't do that.
[00:29:40.769 --> 00:29:41.609]  I'm not gonna get sick.
[00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:46.511]  Well, see, the thing is, I got a flu shot and said I was not gonna get sick, and I got sick.
[00:29:46.711 --> 00:29:47.891]  That's why I don't need to get a flu shot.
[00:29:48.689 --> 00:29:52.651]  So it's not 100% effective and may even cause the flu.
[00:29:52.971 --> 00:29:59.093]  But what do the pharmacists have to say about thimerosal, which you'll find they were very careful to avoid calling it mercury.
[00:29:59.553 --> 00:30:00.934]  It's a preservative.
[00:30:01.694 --> 00:30:04.055]  Is there mercury in that flu shot?
[00:30:04.735 --> 00:30:07.016]  There is an extremely small amount.
[00:30:07.196 --> 00:30:08.657]  Not anything that's dangerous.
[00:30:09.497 --> 00:30:10.558]  And it is preservative-free.
[00:30:11.864 --> 00:30:13.385]  Why do they put that in there?
[00:30:13.726 --> 00:30:17.629]  I don't understand.
[00:30:17.649 --> 00:30:22.913]  The preservative free are drawn up individually so it's more expensive.
[00:30:23.233 --> 00:30:28.337]  The vials, they can do one vial so you can buy it at a cheaper price.
[00:30:28.557 --> 00:30:31.239]  The amount of preservative is less than a can of tuna.
[00:30:31.934 --> 00:30:36.177]  So if you look at it that way, it's really not significant.
[00:30:36.477 --> 00:30:38.158]  So as long as you're not getting a bunch of shots?
[00:30:38.178 --> 00:30:39.519]  Yes, at one time.
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:47.905]  Studies show that most pregnant women should avoid eating canned tuna though, so this really wasn't sitting easy with me.
[00:30:47.985 --> 00:30:52.548]  So I wanted to see what she would say if I introduced pregnancy into the equation.
[00:30:52.668 --> 00:30:54.690]  Would she warn me of potential dangers?
[00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:58.915]  Okay, I'm not pregnant at all, but I'm like, trying to be.
[00:30:58.935 --> 00:30:59.656]  Is that a issue?
[00:30:59.756 --> 00:31:02.420]  They recommend that the pregnant women get the flu shot.
[00:31:02.981 --> 00:31:07.648]  They actually had one death of a pregnant woman last week, and she hadn't had the shot.
[00:31:07.668 --> 00:31:10.352]  Yeah, but here I was reading that it's highly recommended.
[00:31:10.816 --> 00:31:12.197]  For them to get it?
[00:31:12.337 --> 00:31:14.098]  Yeah, every OB to get it.
[00:31:14.359 --> 00:31:20.803]  Because if they come down with a foot bite, they can hardly treat them.
[00:31:21.884 --> 00:31:27.288]  So this shot with the... So they're extremely propelling right now in Texas.
[00:31:27.328 --> 00:31:30.991]  We're trying to get them to get the shot right now.
[00:31:31.011 --> 00:31:32.752]  Wow, even the one with mercury in it?
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:43.427]  Both places administer Fluzone, which contains three influenza strains recommended for this flu season, including the 2009 H1N1.
[00:31:44.328 --> 00:31:51.114]  Surprisingly, Fluzone's own patient information sheet says that animal studies haven't been conducted with Fluzone.
[00:31:51.394 --> 00:31:59.382]  In fact, it says it is not known whether Fluzone can cause fetal harm when given to a pregnant woman or if it can affect reproduction capacity.
[00:31:59.582 --> 00:32:05.663]  So, an untested flu vaccine is being recommended for pregnant women and those who are trying to get pregnant.
[00:32:05.803 --> 00:32:10.064]  Flu zones should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.
[00:32:10.624 --> 00:32:16.025]  According to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, reports of fetal demise during the 2009 H1N1 season increased by 4,250%.
[00:32:16.065 --> 00:32:19.766]  And a study published in 2012 exposes an insane failed experiment on pregnant women during the 2009 flu season.
[00:32:29.628 --> 00:32:38.958]  Dr. Gary Goldman's study published in the Human and Environmental Toxicology Journal points out an astounding fact that no one saw until the publishing of the Goldman study.
[00:32:39.138 --> 00:32:49.789]  The CDC had recommended the double dosing of the pregnant population with the seasonal flu vaccine with mercury and the untested H1N1 vaccine with mercury.
[00:32:50.470 --> 00:33:03.575]  He highlights the fact that the safety and effectiveness of the AH1N1 had never been established in pregnant women, and that the combination of two different influenza vaccines had never been tested on pregnant women at all.
[00:33:04.115 --> 00:33:09.877]  And if you ask for the vaccination package insert like we recommend, you'll find that the warning is still there.
[00:33:09.978 --> 00:33:13.319]  It hasn't been tested on fetal development or reproduction.
[00:33:13.339 --> 00:33:16.780]  The only thing that pregnant women can't get is the live virus.
[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:18.741]  Is the mist into the nose.
[00:33:20.222 --> 00:33:28.036]  Yeah, the pregnant women have to avoid all the live viruses, but the inactivated ones, which most of them do contain migraine, are safe.
[00:33:30.461 --> 00:33:36.944]  And while the increase in vaccinations is wiping out some viruses, new superbugs are popping up to replace them.
[00:33:37.324 --> 00:33:39.145]  You know, you can't fool Mother Nature.
[00:33:39.305 --> 00:33:45.668]  And as you start to eliminate certain bacteria by the vaccines, other bacteria and viruses fill in the gap.
[00:33:46.068 --> 00:33:54.532]  What do you have to say about this thing where it says, like, if I get the flu shot, it can increase my chance of getting a different kind of flu?
[00:33:56.911 --> 00:34:10.309]  For example, they have now shown and discovered in research articles that the pertussis vaccine, which has been eliminating the pertussis bacteria, and we've been seeing the increased rates of pertussis going up.
[00:34:10.729 --> 00:34:12.270]  They've been trying to figure out why that is.
[00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:27.698]  Well, there was an article that came out a couple of weeks ago that said that because the pertussis vaccine eliminates the Bordetella pertussis bacteria, it has created a gap in which another bacteria called Bordetella parapertussis is filling in the gap.
[00:34:28.198 --> 00:34:40.492]  And now that they're finding that that bacteria may have, that Bordetella peripertussis, may have increased more than 40 times in these children that have had a pertussis vaccine.
[00:34:40.852 --> 00:34:46.799]  So now they are developing whooping cough or symptoms that look like whooping cough, but maybe not quite as severe as whooping cough.
[00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:51.182]  And they're finding that it's being caused by this new bacteria called peripertussis.
[00:34:51.563 --> 00:34:55.846]  And I think that's happening with all of the Prevnar vaccines for strep.
[00:34:55.946 --> 00:35:05.834]  It certainly happened for Hib, that as we eliminated Haemophilus influenzae B, there are more strains of that bacteria falling in the gap that are more stronger and more virulent.
[00:35:06.394 --> 00:35:16.585]  So why on earth are they pushing these untested vaccines that are, at best, 70% effective against some viruses and, at worst, are creating new superbugs?
[00:35:17.065 --> 00:35:23.772]  When I started into this back in September of 2000, the vaccine industry was about a $10 billion of your industry.
[00:35:24.212 --> 00:35:26.374]  Now it's in the $30-60 billion.
[00:35:26.435 --> 00:35:29.558]  Some of the vaccines are making $5-10 billion on their own.
[00:35:29.978 --> 00:35:32.361]  The point is, all vaccines come with risks.
[00:35:32.581 --> 00:35:39.848]  So, unless you want to be a paying beta tester for Big Pharma's failed experiments, research the dangers for yourself.
[00:35:40.009 --> 00:35:45.875]  Decide if it's right for you, because even well-meaning healthcare practitioners might not have all the facts.
