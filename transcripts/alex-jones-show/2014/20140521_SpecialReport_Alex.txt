[00:00:03.046 --> 00:00:08.169]  The Affordable Care Act has forced Americans to acquire insurance or face stiff penalties.
[00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.872]  And like many other institutions, insurance companies are not immune to fraud.
[00:00:13.272 --> 00:00:22.797]  According to Dr. Kenneth Fisher's allegations, Noridian Mutual Insurance Company permitted some of its members to receive more benefits than other members on the same insurance plan.
[00:00:22.997 --> 00:00:28.781]  Dr. Fisher alleges that the practice may be costing members millions in increased premiums and other costs.
[00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:33.266]  There is also fraud in times of crisis when people need help the most.
[00:00:33.706 --> 00:00:47.041]  Two Hurricane Katrina whistleblowers have shown that a state farm insurance company committed fraud against the federal government in the mishandling of a homeowner's claim after the devastating 2005 storm, according to a federal jury in Mississippi.
[00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:48.022]  In New York,
[00:00:48.362 --> 00:00:51.625]  There's been reported fraud surrounding Hurricane Sandy as well.
[00:00:52.105 --> 00:01:04.114]  State officials are investigating whether Tri-State Consumer Insurance Company is illegally refusing to participate in a mediation program established to help Superstorm Sandy victims get fair settlements for damage to their homes.
[00:01:04.575 --> 00:01:06.696]  Insurance fraud is well documented.
[00:01:06.876 --> 00:01:09.679]  The FBI estimates that insurance fraud costs U.S.
[00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:13.722]  families as much as $700 a year in increased premiums.
[00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:16.184]  And that's not even counting health insurance.
[00:01:16.804 --> 00:01:20.446]  And one of the largest insurance fraud cases in recent history.
[00:01:20.786 --> 00:01:23.427]  Building 7 of the World Trade Center.
[00:01:23.447 --> 00:01:26.608]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander.
[00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:29.930]  Telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.532]  I said, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life.
[00:01:33.552 --> 00:01:36.493]  Maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.
[00:01:42.792 --> 00:01:50.675]  This would be the equivalent of two neighboring houses burning to the ground so you blew yours up and were still able to collect the insurance money.
[00:01:51.055 --> 00:01:55.076]  Silverstein would go on to say that he meant pull out the first responders.
[00:01:55.376 --> 00:02:02.679]  You can debate what would happen to a building struck by a plane, but Building 7 is a controlled demolition if I ever saw one.
[00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:05.920]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.822]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[00:02:09.382 --> 00:02:10.923]  It just pancaked.
[00:02:11.163 --> 00:02:13.724]  Well, pancaking almost like a precision implosion.
[00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:26.512]  It's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[00:02:39.508 --> 00:02:45.634]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:02:45.654 --> 00:02:48.976]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:02:48.997 --> 00:02:50.698]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:02:50.738 --> 00:02:56.984]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:02:57.104 --> 00:03:02.969]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.890]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.011]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:03:10.171 --> 00:03:18.153]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:03:18.453 --> 00:03:20.474]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:21.574]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:03:21.954 --> 00:03:30.703]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
