[00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.811]  The city of Houston demanded to see pastors' sermons in a chilling attempt to silence free speech.
[00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:17.912]  The controversy is centered around Houston's so-called bathroom bill.
[00:00:18.232 --> 00:00:23.574]  It's a law that passed in June, allowing members of the opposite sex to use each other's restrooms.
[00:00:24.054 --> 00:00:28.935]  Houston residents responded by collecting 50,000 signatures to get the measure repealed.
[00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:38.160]  But the city's lesbian mayor and her city attorney rejected the petition, and this prompted its supporters and the Alliance Defending Freedom to file a lawsuit.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:47.826]  Well, the city shot back, and they demanded that pastors who are opposed to the law hand over their communications with church members regarding transgender individuals.
[00:00:48.126 --> 00:00:55.751]  The attempt to intimidate pastors by obtaining any sermons and communications is clearly a violation of the First Amendment.
[00:00:56.091 --> 00:01:01.974]  It's a full frontal assault on religious freedom and a blatant abuse of power against political enemies.
[00:01:02.275 --> 00:01:07.838]  Now we know that the government is all about the separation of church and state when it comes to tax exemption.
[00:01:08.338 --> 00:01:14.485]  But, to them, the church is quite a handy place of infiltration when it comes to exerting their authority.
[00:01:22.413 --> 00:01:25.295]  Easing public fears and quelling dissent would be critical.
[00:01:25.776 --> 00:01:30.919]  And that's exactly what the Clergy Response Team, as it's called, helped accomplish in New Orleans.
[00:01:31.339 --> 00:01:37.242]  Such Clergy Response Teams would walk a tightrope between the needs of the government versus the wishes of the public.
[00:01:37.743 --> 00:01:44.547]  In a lot of cases, these clergy would already be known in the neighborhoods in which they're helping to defuse that situation.
[00:01:44.867 --> 00:01:52.270]  For the clergy, one of the biggest tools that they will have in helping calm the public down or obey the law is the Bible itself.
[00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.130]  Specifically, Romans.
[00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.571]  Romans 13.
[00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:59.452]  A government that sees itself as God wants to be worshipped.
[00:01:59.912 --> 00:02:02.833]  So naturally, tyrannical governments invade the church.
[00:02:03.413 --> 00:02:06.875]  And this invasion is typically granted by way of Romans 13.
[00:02:07.975 --> 00:02:09.538]  Because the government is established by the Lord.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.480]  You know?
[00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:12.465]  And that's what we believe in the Christian faith.
[00:02:12.485 --> 00:02:13.687]  That's what's stated in the scripture.
[00:02:14.168 --> 00:02:17.275]  And if we don't get the preachers of America to shake off...
[00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:29.896]  This asinine interpretation of Romans Chapter 13, to obey the government no matter what, we are going to repeat the fate and the destiny of Germany.
[00:02:29.976 --> 00:02:39.601]  The Nazi regime took Romans Chapter 13, they created entire messages around that fallacious interpretation, sent it out to the churches.
[00:02:40.282 --> 00:02:41.023]  And the pastors.
[00:02:41.343 --> 00:02:45.365]  And then they regurgitated it in their pulpits in Nazi Germany.
[00:02:45.385 --> 00:02:48.627]  The net result was, of those 14,000 evangelical churches, 800 stood against it.
[00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:48.627]  800.
[00:02:48.687 --> 00:02:49.247]  5% of 14,000 tried to resist.
[00:02:59.526 --> 00:03:14.044]  So the battle has always been, will men be free to be governed by God, or will they submit to the tyrannical reign of those who would usurp the authority of God?
[00:03:14.504 --> 00:03:15.826]  Now even non-Christians
[00:03:16.687 --> 00:03:24.214]  Even non-Christians must have the freedom to either choose to worship God or not, and that is central to our understanding of freedom in this country.
[00:03:24.535 --> 00:03:31.742]  That's why we have this sacrosanct doctrine that we believe that all men are free in the matter of faith and religion.
[00:03:32.042 --> 00:03:35.726]  Without that, you're reduced to tyranny, you're reduced to despotism.
[00:03:36.286 --> 00:03:38.928]  And I think that's the battle, Alex, that we're facing today.
[00:03:38.988 --> 00:03:52.256]  God's trying to make you free so you can choose free will and develop as your own person, but the globalists and throughout history, they're always trying to become God, act like God, take your free will to make you a slave.
[00:03:52.716 --> 00:03:57.479]  They're really going after everybody's free will and they want the state to be God.
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:04.364]  Our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the forces that rule and govern this dark world.
[00:04:05.202 --> 00:04:09.457]  And that's why we have the famous quote by the founders, resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
