[00:00:02.253 --> 00:00:05.155]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com in Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:00:05.375 --> 00:00:11.700]  I'm standing right at the spot where I was shot by a rubber bullet and Josh Owens and Jakari Jackson were gassed.
[00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.562]  We were all separated and you guys know how that story goes.
[00:00:14.602 --> 00:00:17.364]  We had to run in different directions.
[00:00:17.424 --> 00:00:25.089]  Josh Owens was stuck over here with someone from Vice in their car while the police were shooting flashbangs at them.
[00:00:25.389 --> 00:00:27.811]  Jakari Jackson was chased down this road right here.
[00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:33.332]  And I got the footage of Al Jazeera being attacked as well and myself got shot right here.
[00:00:33.692 --> 00:00:42.854]  And then I actually had two of the young black boys or teenagers actually help pick me up and then help me hop through fences through this neighborhood right over here if you want to take a look.
[00:00:43.094 --> 00:00:50.695]  I had to go through all that that rubbish and all that stuff and then hop fences for about an hour and a half until we finally met up.
[00:00:51.195 --> 00:00:52.935]  Now this is what you see.
[00:00:52.975 --> 00:00:55.476]  You see a very calm area in Ferguson right now.
[00:00:55.716 --> 00:00:56.136]  Ferguson
[00:00:57.718 --> 00:00:58.739]  This is what it looks like.
[00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.480]  Now I encourage you to go turn on an MSM channel.
[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.601]  Go turn on Fox.
[00:01:03.641 --> 00:01:04.481]  Go turn on CNN.
[00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:08.263]  Go turn on your local news affiliate and see what they're saying.
[00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:11.004]  They make it seem like this place right here is a war zone.
[00:01:11.484 --> 00:01:18.227]  That there are people standing up in the roads right now, throwing Molotov cocktails, burning down buildings and all that.
[00:01:18.627 --> 00:01:19.848]  That is not what's happening.
[00:01:20.068 --> 00:01:22.629]  What that is, is the MSM.
[00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:24.170]  They're bought out by the government.
[00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:26.894]  They are promoting this violence.
[00:01:26.974 --> 00:01:40.760]  They want the world to make it, they want it to seem like it's just complete and total chaos so they can do what they did last time and steal martial law, bring in these curfews like they said didn't exist but then all of a sudden existed.
[00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.882]  You know, what this is about is more than just the death of Michael Brown.
[00:01:45.442 --> 00:01:48.983]  It's, the world got to see what's really going on behind the curtain.
[00:01:49.444 --> 00:01:52.385]  You know, journalists being attacked for reporting the news.
[00:01:53.305 --> 00:01:54.185]  That's ridiculous.
[00:01:54.445 --> 00:01:56.286]  You know, yeah, a rubber bullet hit me.
[00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:57.986]  I'm not gonna cry about it.
[00:01:58.026 --> 00:01:58.466]  I don't care.
[00:01:58.506 --> 00:01:59.206]  It's a rubber bullet.
[00:01:59.246 --> 00:02:00.047]  I've been to combat.
[00:02:00.087 --> 00:02:01.047]  I did my ten years.
[00:02:01.407 --> 00:02:02.967]  I've seen heavy-duty combat.
[00:02:03.267 --> 00:02:05.388]  That's not the point, that a rubber bullet hit me.
[00:02:06.088 --> 00:02:10.689]  The point is, is that police officers broke the law and attacked journalists.
[00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:17.811]  The thing is, is that the police officers broke the law and told protesters they couldn't stand still when they were being peaceful.
[00:02:18.697 --> 00:02:19.678]  They were attacking them.
[00:02:19.878 --> 00:02:26.384]  They had their hands on their batons, wringing it around like this, and beating them on the ground, pointing sniper rifles at people.
[00:02:27.004 --> 00:02:29.447]  That's the country that we're starting to live in now.
[00:02:29.847 --> 00:02:30.588]  This is 1984.
[00:02:31.008 --> 00:02:32.730]  Orwell was right.
[00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.891]  All this right here?
[00:02:34.491 --> 00:02:43.918]  This is calm now, but the only reason it turned to what it did last time is because the police came out here with their MRAPs, started pointing sniper rifles at people, and people reacted to that.
[00:02:44.258 --> 00:02:55.246]  Tell me how you would feel at home if you were out walking up and down the street, and a military vehicle pops up, and a guy comes out of the hatch with a sniper rifle and puts a red dot on your chest, and tell me you're not going to be a little pissed off.
[00:02:55.807 --> 00:03:00.791]  I'd like to see you sit out here and keep the calm and composure that 98% of the people out here did.
[00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:08.975]  I saw peaceful, beautiful people sitting out here holding arms, locked up, talking, praying, and being peaceful.
[00:03:09.735 --> 00:03:12.917]  It's not what they're trying to fear hype it up to be.
[00:03:13.217 --> 00:03:17.379]  The fear mongering is out of control with MSM when it comes to what's going on out here.
[00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.831]  There's nothing wrong with going out and peacefully assembling and talking about that.
[00:03:23.311 --> 00:03:24.972]  You know, that's what we're supposed to do.
[00:03:25.012 --> 00:03:26.112]  It's in the Constitution.
[00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:28.352]  That is our right to come out here.
[00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:32.733]  And when the police come in here and peed on that and tell you, hey, you can't sit there.
[00:03:33.054 --> 00:03:33.874]  You got to move on.
[00:03:34.054 --> 00:03:35.394]  Hey, you can't be over here.
[00:03:35.434 --> 00:03:35.994]  You're a journalist.
[00:03:36.014 --> 00:03:37.255]  Get that camera out of my face.
[00:03:37.555 --> 00:03:38.555]  I'm going to effing kill you.
[00:03:39.434 --> 00:03:41.117]  That's when our country is getting out of control.
[00:03:41.337 --> 00:03:46.605]  And that's when you, as a people, need to talk to your friends and family and go, hey, wake the hell up.
[00:03:46.845 --> 00:03:47.867]  This is what's going on.
[00:03:48.087 --> 00:03:49.369]  We need to do something about this.
[00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.813]  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.
[00:03:52.454 --> 00:03:54.197]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
