[00:00:19.568 --> 00:00:21.290]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.853]  I'm David Knight and it's Monday, September 1st, 2014.
[00:00:25.434 --> 00:00:27.116]  Now tonight we have a special edition for you.
[00:00:27.156 --> 00:00:31.120]  We have a replay of some of our very important recent reports.
[00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.627]  You know, with your support, we've been able to give you first-hand reporting from some of the hot spots like Ferguson,
[00:00:38.127 --> 00:00:40.988]  It's a very different perspective than you get from the mainstream media.
[00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:47.790]  We think it's worth taking another look at it, and it's something that we appreciate you supporting us, allowing us to send these reporters into the field.
[00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.131]  It's your subscription to Prison Planet TV that helps us to do this.
[00:00:51.891 --> 00:00:53.831]  So, without further ado, here are those reports.
[00:00:55.532 --> 00:01:00.053]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com at Glenn Spencer's ranch in Hereford, Arizona.
[00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:06.955]  We just now got back from the flight that he took us up on in a single-engine Cessna, where he showed us what he promised.
[00:01:07.927 --> 00:01:10.588]  Mind-blowing stuff across our borders right now.
[00:01:10.988 --> 00:01:21.212]  We're going to show you the footage of what we saw and explain to you what it is, what Glenn's telling us it means, because he is the leading expert on the border in this area.
[00:01:21.252 --> 00:01:23.233]  He has been covering this for 22 years.
[00:01:23.573 --> 00:01:27.175]  All the stuff that he has predicted and said would happen has happened.
[00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:34.138]  What you can see right behind me is a pretty, you know, regular-sized fence, and there's that here for a little bit.
[00:01:34.798 --> 00:01:39.620]  But once you get a few more miles up this way, what we saw was just crazy.
[00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.602]  What the Department of Homeland Security, what our government is telling you.
[00:01:43.222 --> 00:01:49.305]  They say that there's a fence up, so when they get in front of a press conference and they say something, they can feel good about themselves.
[00:01:49.905 --> 00:01:51.286]  They can feel like they're not lying.
[00:01:51.826 --> 00:01:57.847]  But their idea of this huge fence that's really going to cross our border is a lot like what you saw yesterday.
[00:01:58.227 --> 00:01:59.688]  It's so easy to step over.
[00:01:59.728 --> 00:02:03.828]  It is so easy to get through that without anybody knowing you.
[00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:13.510]  Once we got a few miles up the road right up here, when we were flying down, you get over this little mountain ravine and you don't see anything at all.
[00:02:14.191 --> 00:02:16.691]  There's just open areas for miles.
[00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:18.071]  We flew for 30 minutes.
[00:02:18.431 --> 00:02:20.512]  There was not one Border Patrol vehicle
[00:02:21.354 --> 00:02:21.394]  In
[00:02:39.485 --> 00:02:45.850]  To put up the fence that they're saying that they're going to have to support us, to help protect us from all the stuff that's happening.
[00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:47.172]  But they're not doing that.
[00:02:47.512 --> 00:02:52.856]  Instead, they're wasting our tax dollars on this fancy facility that doesn't even need to be there.
[00:02:53.517 --> 00:02:54.178]  It's ridiculous.
[00:02:54.838 --> 00:03:05.027]  And all you'll see for 30 minutes we saw just flying over the over Arizona and Mexico was just something literally waist high that you could just step over and you're home free.
[00:03:06.826 --> 00:03:09.335]  If that doesn't just blow your mind, I don't know what else can.
[00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:12.646]  Our government is purposely doing this right now.
[00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.131]  You know, we saw earlier a fence that they put up.
[00:03:17.191 --> 00:03:19.894]  They spent three million dollars every mile to put up a fence.
[00:03:20.294 --> 00:03:22.636]  And all they did was raise it up, put the pins in.
[00:03:23.397 --> 00:03:24.497]  This stuff is everywhere.
[00:03:24.598 --> 00:03:25.698]  Anybody can come through.
[00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:28.501]  And people say, oh, that's racist to say something like that.
[00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:29.061]  No, no, no.
[00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:29.842]  No, it's not.
[00:03:30.282 --> 00:03:34.566]  Because you don't know who comes into Mexico, and then you don't know who comes from Mexico into our country.
[00:03:35.046 --> 00:03:36.748]  Because our borders aren't secure.
[00:03:38.897 --> 00:03:41.459]  You need to call people who are in charge.
[00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:43.381]  We need to get a hold of the people of the White House.
[00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:47.604]  We need to do something because this is horrible.
[00:03:49.846 --> 00:03:57.192]  The stories that we heard from the ranchers here are mind-blowing about the things they see, the people coming through, the smuggling.
[00:03:57.612 --> 00:04:03.157]  They use these little trenches and ravines that come through under the border and hide, and there's trees and stuff.
[00:04:03.497 --> 00:04:04.538]  You're not going to see that.
[00:04:04.918 --> 00:04:08.460]  They put up some fancy camera every now and then the Border Patrol does.
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.101]  Half of them don't even work.
[00:04:10.441 --> 00:04:14.523]  And if they do, they can't see someone walking through that little area and flying overhead.
[00:04:14.563 --> 00:04:23.028]  What we saw is it's so easy to have cover and concealment and never be seen by all this money they're wasting on these stupid cameras that don't do anything.
[00:04:23.588 --> 00:04:25.529]  We don't have enough Border Patrol on our borders.
[00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.171]  Sending a military out here is really not the answer.
[00:04:31.323 --> 00:04:32.544]  We need to do something about it.
[00:04:33.144 --> 00:04:34.344]  You need to wake up America.
[00:04:34.605 --> 00:04:41.688]  You need to start talking about this stuff and we need to make a change because this crap going on out here is ridiculous and it's got to stop.
[00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:44.369]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:51.793]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com in Hereford, Arizona right along the borderline fence through
[00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:55.130]  Glenn Spencer's backyard.
[00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:58.633]  This is the gentleman we spoke to the other day on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:59.293 --> 00:05:00.954]  As you can see, it's a pretty big fence.
[00:05:01.835 --> 00:05:03.036]  About 100 yards up there.
[00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:06.178]  Then it comes into this little fence right here.
[00:05:06.678 --> 00:05:15.945]  And what I'm going to show you is how easy it is if you're an illegal alien trying to come across a border or a drug smuggler to come into America.
[00:05:16.325 --> 00:05:17.726]  This right here is mind-blowing.
[00:05:17.786 --> 00:05:18.307]  Check this out.
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.461]  You come right over through this.
[00:05:24.362 --> 00:05:25.082]  You come over here.
[00:05:27.824 --> 00:05:30.226]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am in Mexico right now.
[00:05:30.687 --> 00:05:31.087]  This is it.
[00:05:31.147 --> 00:05:32.048]  That's how easy it was.
[00:05:32.068 --> 00:05:39.254]  There's nothing here to keep me from coming across into the country and flooding our streets with drugs and illegal aliens.
[00:05:39.674 --> 00:05:41.055]  This is what's going on right now.
[00:05:41.535 --> 00:05:43.277]  The Border Patrol is not doing anything.
[00:05:43.297 --> 00:05:46.760]  They're saying it's going to take another five years to even get some of this stuff fixed.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.142]  And they've been saying that for a decade.
[00:05:50.114 --> 00:05:59.040]  This is crazy, this is stuff that the people in America need to look at, and this is something that we need to get fixed, because we have to stop this illegal flood of aliens coming to our country right now.
[00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:01.873]  Alright, now you can see this.
[00:06:01.953 --> 00:06:04.556]  The process to come back in to the U.S.
[00:06:04.576 --> 00:06:05.256]  is so easy.
[00:06:05.456 --> 00:06:06.237]  And this is what happens.
[00:06:06.257 --> 00:06:07.298]  They come through this fence.
[00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:08.460]  They bring their drugs.
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.622]  There's no Border Patrol anywhere around out in this area.
[00:06:11.282 --> 00:06:13.805]  And what happens is, this is a wildlife refuge through here.
[00:06:14.586 --> 00:06:21.072]  For about 20 miles, there is no way the Border Patrol can even access this land unless they have
[00:06:21.793 --> 00:06:48.513]  Absolute positive identity of a suspect coming across so that means 99% of the time they have no idea these people are coming through and what happens is these guys can just essentially walk all the way out here and They're home free once they get past this area this wildlife refuge through here There's nothing that stops them from getting into our country the Obama voters are now free to enter our country And we are importing this poverty, but it's not just happening here in the border.
[00:06:48.553 --> 00:06:50.795]  This is happening everywhere It's happening in Minnesota
[00:06:51.275 --> 00:06:56.840]  It's been all over our country right now but this is where it starts and this is where we need to stop it.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:04.026]  Stay tuned because for the next 36 hours we will continue putting up reports informing you on the situation down here at the border.
[00:07:04.386 --> 00:07:08.590]  I'm Joe Biggs on the front lines of battle for immigration with InfoWars.com
[00:07:09.778 --> 00:07:14.081]  About two weeks ago, it went viral when Spider-Man fought cops in Times Square.
[00:07:14.722 --> 00:07:18.204]  The New York Times interviewed many of them, looking behind the masks.
[00:07:18.584 --> 00:07:29.713]  They talked to a Mexican Elmo, an Ecuadorian Spongebob, a Colombian Statue of Liberty, and another one from the Dominican Republic, Peruvian Toy Story characters, a Moroccan Spider-Man, a Colombian penguin,
[00:07:30.453 --> 00:07:30.913]  That's right.
[00:07:31.294 --> 00:07:35.057]  These costumed characters are virtually all illegal aliens.
[00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:38.639]  They came here illegally, working menial jobs that paid very little.
[00:07:39.059 --> 00:07:44.444]  Then they learned they could buy unlicensed costumes from Peru and panhandle in Times Square.
[00:07:44.944 --> 00:07:49.447]  The Ecuadorian SpongeBob made $80 in just five hours on his first day.
[00:07:49.848 --> 00:07:50.988]  COOKIE!
[00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:53.030]  Panhandling is against the law.
[00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.953]  Using someone else's copyrighted character in your business is against the law.
[00:07:57.253 --> 00:07:59.977]  But the New York Times gives him a pass saying, See?
[00:07:59.997 --> 00:08:00.357]  It's okay.
[00:08:00.377 --> 00:08:01.218]  They don't speak English.
[00:08:01.238 --> 00:08:03.441]  Illegal aliens are above all of our laws, including our copyright laws.
[00:08:13.655 --> 00:08:19.159]  Yet we're told that because of copyright violations, we have to hand over an internet kill switch to the government.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:25.384]  They want to be able to instantly shut down any website on a mere accusation of copyright violation.
[00:08:25.685 --> 00:08:35.733]  And it's the very same companies that tolerate copyright violations in Times Square by illegal aliens that are screaming the loudest about internet control for copyright protection.
[00:08:36.093 --> 00:08:37.194]  Take Disney, for example.
[00:08:37.634 --> 00:08:43.177]  Except for these illegal costume characters, Disney has been incredibly aggressive in protecting their copyrights.
[00:08:43.677 --> 00:08:52.122]  They got a lot of bad publicity back in 1986 when they threatened three daycare centers with expensive lawsuits because they had painted Disney characters on their walls.
[00:08:52.502 --> 00:08:58.926]  Hanna-Barbera not only offered their characters as a replacement, they sent their own studio artists to paint the mural.
[00:08:59.426 --> 00:09:08.892]  Then three years later, Disney sued the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the people who do the Oscars, because they opened their Oscar show with Snow White and didn't get permission.
[00:09:09.273 --> 00:09:13.475]  It is so exciting to be here tonight.
[00:09:14.256 --> 00:09:18.579]  There are stars out tonight.
[00:09:18.599 --> 00:09:20.380]  Stars with glamour are gleaming.
[00:09:22.369 --> 00:09:26.314]  It's a shame they didn't stop that performance with a prior restraining order.
[00:09:26.875 --> 00:09:36.668]  Then in 2008, in a case exactly like what's going on in Times Square, a couple with a children's party business performed for the kids in Winnie the Pooh costumes.
[00:09:37.329 --> 00:09:43.794]  Disney sent them a cease and desist letter, which they complied with, except the demand to send Disney the costume.
[00:09:44.134 --> 00:09:47.837]  Instead, they returned it to the unlicensed Peruvian company for credit.
[00:09:48.198 --> 00:09:52.181]  The same company illegals in Times Square prefer to get their costumes from.
[00:09:52.501 --> 00:09:56.984]  Disney slapped the couple with a $1 million lawsuit, plus attorney's fees.
[00:09:57.365 --> 00:09:59.626]  And at the time, Disney said this.
[00:10:00.147 --> 00:10:06.172]  Without firm licensing agreements, the company noted, it cannot control the quality and nature of the performance.
[00:10:06.812 --> 00:10:13.074]  The quality of the costumes, or the quality and background of the individuals providing the performance.
[00:10:13.695 --> 00:10:20.417]  Disney's already seen its character turned into a sex toy story when an illegal woody was arrested for sex abuse.
[00:10:21.157 --> 00:10:23.258]  Even Santa Claus has weighed in on the issue.
[00:10:23.558 --> 00:10:33.582]  That's right, the real Santa Claus, a monk in North Pole, Alaska, who's legally changed his name, wants licensing of these Times Square characters to screen out pedophiles.
[00:10:34.082 --> 00:10:38.185]  But illegal costume characters want regulations to shut out competition.
[00:10:38.785 --> 00:10:42.627]  Especially those Americans who they say flout the law.
[00:10:43.087 --> 00:10:45.049]  What's the Spanish word for irony?
[00:10:45.749 --> 00:10:50.452]  But they seriously don't like Americans calling them money-grubbing aravistas.
[00:10:50.612 --> 00:10:51.573]  In other words, newcomers.
[00:10:52.053 --> 00:10:54.514]  Times Square, they say, is their territory.
[00:10:54.835 --> 00:11:00.038]  The panhandling illegal costume character business is for illegal aliens who started it.
[00:11:00.638 --> 00:11:06.821]  Yet, these black market entrepreneurs truly understand the basis of most of our business regulation.
[00:11:07.221 --> 00:11:09.662]  And that is to keep out your competition.
[00:11:10.022 --> 00:11:17.365]  Now, if they want the government to come in and regulate those money-grubbing Americans, which laws are the illegal costume characters going to obey?
[00:11:17.745 --> 00:11:21.347]  Do they want New York City to give them a license to illegally use copyrights?
[00:11:21.867 --> 00:11:28.731]  Should we ignore their copyright theft and call them undocumented costume characters until they get a license from Disney or Sesame Street?
[00:11:28.991 --> 00:11:31.472]  Are they even trying to get a copyright license?
[00:11:31.992 --> 00:11:38.156]  They pretend they're not violating the copyrights by saying that they're just street performers and they're not doing this for a living.
[00:11:38.436 --> 00:11:44.319]  But when New York City put up signs this past weekend telling tourists that photos are free, tipping is optional,
[00:11:44.679 --> 00:11:49.225]  An illegal costume character named Juan Perez complained that his income had dropped from $80 to $15.
[00:11:49.365 --> 00:11:50.106]  Another, Claudia Arias, said,
[00:12:01.741 --> 00:12:06.644]  But wait, I thought they weren't doing this for money, because that would be panhandling and copyright infringement.
[00:12:06.964 --> 00:12:15.649]  Now that the illegal costume characters have been caught in a lie, they're going to unite, and they're going to create a union so they can have political clout in town hall.
[00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:26.135]  They've turned to La Fuente, an organization that has a history of lobbying in favor of illegal activity and demanding rights for those who actually flout the law.
[00:12:26.756 --> 00:12:28.257]  Illegal characters are above the law.
[00:12:28.997 --> 00:12:34.520]  Only those with political connections and lobbyists can stay in business or be allowed to work.
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:40.483]  Who would have thought that Cookie Monster could give us such a comprehensive lesson on our immigration policy?
[00:12:44.039 --> 00:12:44.800]  Don't shoot!
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.680]  Hands up!
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:46.541]  Don't shoot!
[00:12:46.601 --> 00:12:47.381]  Hands up!
[00:12:47.481 --> 00:12:48.242]  Don't shoot!
[00:12:48.322 --> 00:12:49.062]  Hands up!
[00:12:49.142 --> 00:12:49.843]  Don't shoot!
[00:12:50.063 --> 00:12:50.723]  Hands up!
[00:12:50.803 --> 00:12:51.464]  Don't shoot!
[00:12:52.164 --> 00:12:55.566]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com in Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:12:55.886 --> 00:12:59.449]  Right now, the riot police are standing beside us, right behind us.
[00:12:59.489 --> 00:13:02.470]  They have this entire bridge, this road, blocked off.
[00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:03.951]  You are in the parking lot.
[00:13:04.612 --> 00:13:05.292]  This is the St.
[00:13:05.332 --> 00:13:06.933]  Louis County Police Department.
[00:13:07.714 --> 00:13:10.876]  Disperse now or you will be arrested.
[00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:29.584]  As you can see, tensions are high here in Ferguson because of what happened.
[00:13:29.845 --> 00:13:31.005]  The people are tired.
[00:13:31.366 --> 00:13:33.467]  People all over America are tired.
[00:13:33.767 --> 00:13:34.328]  How cops
[00:13:34.788 --> 00:13:37.350]  Kill and beat innocent people for no reason.
[00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:41.213]  This is what we have to look forward to all over the place.
[00:13:41.453 --> 00:13:46.737]  Look how quick, within a matter of days, they were able to go into a martial law status here in Ferguson.
[00:14:01.108 --> 00:14:02.829]  I'm putting my life on the line for my people.
[00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.591]  I'm putting my life on the line for everybody in this country.
[00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:06.172]  I believe in equality.
[00:14:06.212 --> 00:14:07.713]  We have a right to assemble!
[00:14:07.953 --> 00:14:09.535]  And why the cops tell us we can't be out here?
[00:14:09.555 --> 00:14:11.196]  Like you said, we have a right to assemble.
[00:14:11.216 --> 00:14:11.776]  Martial laws.
[00:14:11.816 --> 00:14:12.537]  Martial laws.
[00:14:12.557 --> 00:14:14.258]  The one authority of police every day.
[00:14:14.498 --> 00:14:15.939]  They have complete domain over us.
[00:14:15.979 --> 00:14:16.660]  They are like gods.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.982]  If they tell you not to do something, you cannot do it.
[00:14:19.002 --> 00:14:21.263]  And if you do, they will treat you like a dog.
[00:14:21.283 --> 00:14:22.144]  You will be shot down.
[00:14:22.404 --> 00:14:23.425]  Well, at least for a black man.
[00:14:23.465 --> 00:14:25.426]  I'm not sure for everybody, but I do understand that.
[00:14:25.747 --> 00:14:27.308]  I hope it's not like that for everybody.
[00:14:27.968 --> 00:14:28.548]  It shouldn't be.
[00:14:28.608 --> 00:14:31.889]  It should not be like that for any human being to live on this planet.
[00:14:31.929 --> 00:14:33.030]  We're from the same blood.
[00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:35.070]  We are from the same descendants.
[00:14:36.051 --> 00:14:41.432]  There's no way one person can tell us or one small amount of people can tell us what and what we cannot do.
[00:14:41.452 --> 00:14:43.253]  There's something as an actual people being unity.
[00:14:43.273 --> 00:14:44.793]  That's not something we cannot happen at all.
[00:14:45.234 --> 00:14:45.534]  At all.
[00:14:46.234 --> 00:14:47.074]  Mike Brown!
[00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:48.515]  Mike Brown!
[00:14:48.955 --> 00:14:50.115]  Mike Brown!
[00:14:50.275 --> 00:14:51.515]  Mike Brown!
[00:14:51.636 --> 00:14:53.316]  Mike Brown!
[00:14:53.376 --> 00:14:54.256]  We are!
[00:14:54.396 --> 00:14:55.037]  Mike Brown!
[00:14:55.097 --> 00:14:55.517]  We are!
[00:14:55.717 --> 00:14:56.317]  Mike Brown!
[00:14:58.237 --> 00:15:03.560]  The citizens here are standing their ground and protesting and speaking about what they know, what they believe in.
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.382]  So far from what you heard, the people here are very educated.
[00:15:06.682 --> 00:15:07.803]  They know about their rights.
[00:15:08.063 --> 00:15:13.086]  They're just trying to get across their point that they're tired of this kind of stuff going on.
[00:15:13.546 --> 00:15:22.051]  As you can see behind me right now, there are riot police, linked arm, probably 60 to 70 armed personnel with tanks and armored vehicles behind them.
[00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:26.694]  They are ready to push through the town of Ferguson and completely lock it down.
[00:15:27.054 --> 00:15:27.495]  What is that?
[00:15:27.795 --> 00:15:28.716]  That's martial law.
[00:15:29.176 --> 00:15:32.759]  That's going to happen across our entire nation because our government doesn't care.
[00:15:32.779 --> 00:15:34.160]  This is crazy.
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:37.803]  This is what America has to look up to, look forward to, if they do not wake up.
[00:15:38.283 --> 00:15:38.864]  Listen to me.
[00:15:39.204 --> 00:15:39.784]  Wake up.
[00:15:40.725 --> 00:15:43.067]  Stop sitting on your couch and being lazy.
[00:15:43.427 --> 00:15:46.149]  This kind of stuff can come to your town and happen in a second.
[00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:47.310]  Know your rights.
[00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:50.273]  Know what you're able to do as an American and stand up for that right.
[00:15:51.013 --> 00:15:54.561]  The stuff is intense and we're going to keep following this for the next few days.
[00:15:54.822 --> 00:15:57.227]  Stay tuned to InfoWars.com for more reports.
[00:15:57.488 --> 00:15:58.109]  I'm Joe Biggs.

[00:16:08.527 --> 00:16:16.754]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:16:16.934 --> 00:16:21.598]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:16:35.766 --> 00:16:37.567]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[00:16:37.667 --> 00:16:42.650]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:47.133]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[00:18:11.175 --> 00:18:35.454]  Tonight we quite frankly have some extremely shocking information and that's in a news system that is just full of incredibly disturbing things and we bring you this information not to scare you but to hopefully cause a debate in this country about the serious things that are happening so we can reverse what's unfolding.
[00:18:36.676 --> 00:18:42.618]  The Department of Homeland Security is always saying that if you see something, say something.
[00:18:43.658 --> 00:19:00.084]  Well, historically, when you see government buying millions of bullets, openly saying the American people are the main terror threat, openly saying that Christians and gun owners are the number one threat, even above Al-Qaeda, and buying thousands of armored vehicles, and admitting
[00:19:01.246 --> 00:19:06.654]  That they plan to put regular army on the streets of every major city and town.
[00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:15.326]  And the government sets up a Rural Affairs Commission run by NORTHCOM and the Department of Defense to keep an eye on rural communities.
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:23.243]  While our government is openly funding Al-Qaeda and ISIS in the Middle East, you know that treason is taking place.
[00:19:23.303 --> 00:19:27.244]  And so, we have seen something and we are saying something.
[00:19:27.404 --> 00:19:34.107]  And viewers out there, one of them will just go by CB in places like Georgia,
[00:19:34.967 --> 00:19:40.951]  Are the HUMET, or the True Organic Human Intelligence, and our eyes and ears.
[00:19:41.251 --> 00:19:49.856]  And that's why Infowars.com every week breaks national news stories that get picked up by thousands of publications and national television.
[00:19:50.116 --> 00:19:53.498]  Because we are engaged in real journalism here.
[00:19:54.238 --> 00:19:56.579]  We go wherever the truth leads us.
[00:19:56.679 --> 00:20:01.460]  Now, we've seen a long slide towards a paramilitary police state in this country.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:07.562]  I've been talking about it for a long time, made four films on the subject since the late 1990s, and we are now here.
[00:20:08.102 --> 00:20:11.603]  They've gone from denying that this is happening to admitting it.
[00:20:12.584 --> 00:20:14.864]  I struggle to put a headline on this.
[00:20:15.945 --> 00:20:19.466]  Regular Army Trains to Inter-Americans.
[00:20:21.084 --> 00:20:25.605]  Regular Army trains to take over U.S.
[00:20:25.685 --> 00:20:26.065]  cities.
[00:20:26.545 --> 00:20:28.646]  But that doesn't encompass how bad this is.
[00:20:29.666 --> 00:20:32.066]  The end of Posse Comitatus, which it is.
[00:20:32.907 --> 00:20:40.188]  The 1878 law banning regular army engaging in law enforcement operations in the states.
[00:20:40.208 --> 00:20:43.869]  That's why the governors call out the National Guard, not the quote, big army.
[00:20:44.821 --> 00:20:45.581]  This is a big deal.
[00:20:46.382 --> 00:20:56.626]  And in 2007 and 2009 in the Defense Authorization Acts, the National Defense Authorization Acts, they basically removed it and said, don't worry, we won't, you know, abuse this new power.
[00:20:57.106 --> 00:21:05.170]  As we see military at kite festivals in Austin and we see the National Guard going under the President, not under the states.
[00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:13.734]  It's a major transference of power from the already weak states to the out-of-control central government and there's a massive
[00:21:14.708 --> 00:21:23.091]  Ratcheting up from this training being secret when I first started reporting on it in 1996, to it now being out in the open.
[00:21:24.031 --> 00:21:36.795]  Back in 1996, 97, 98, I would go show urban warfare drills, they're practicing to confiscate guns, and the information was so shocking that they would have the media come out and say, no, Delta Force was not in Houston.
[00:21:37.595 --> 00:21:46.800]  Or Delta Force was not in San Antonio until I went and interviewed police chiefs and others that said, no, no, they're here and they're buying people off.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.361]  It appears to be a covert takeover plan.
[00:21:49.841 --> 00:21:50.802]  Now, that was Clinton.
[00:21:50.902 --> 00:21:52.703]  Now, under Obama, it's gone into full gear.
[00:21:53.183 --> 00:21:54.484]  Bush was involved in it as well.
[00:21:55.544 --> 00:21:58.286]  Just a fact, under Democrats, this stuff goes into high gear.
[00:21:58.786 --> 00:22:04.709]  And again, they're saying domestically, Tea Party, Christians, we're veterans, are THE terror threat, not Al Qaeda.
[00:22:05.449 --> 00:22:07.651]  That is sensational information.
[00:22:07.691 --> 00:22:11.673]  Hopefully, if you get this video out to people, we're about to get into the details, we can, uh...
[00:22:12.571 --> 00:22:15.674]  Get a debate going in Congress at the state level about this.
[00:22:16.355 --> 00:22:18.837]  You out there as viewers have already spurred a debate about this.
[00:22:19.217 --> 00:22:21.379]  I talk to congressmen and women all the time on and off air.
[00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:25.923]  And they say they're having hearings on this precisely because of your work.
[00:22:26.244 --> 00:22:27.124]  So understand that here.
[00:22:27.901 --> 00:22:28.961]  It's like a horse and carriage.
[00:22:29.622 --> 00:22:31.022]  Or it's like a lock and key.
[00:22:32.162 --> 00:22:32.943]  It goes together.
[00:22:33.123 --> 00:22:35.803]  You are the reason we know about this.
[00:22:35.823 --> 00:22:43.926]  This information you're about to see, that is big army, regular army, trying to put black people behind barbed wire.
[00:22:43.946 --> 00:22:45.906]  I mean, that's the footage.
[00:22:46.647 --> 00:22:51.008]  You're about to see that a local, who works in the area, I'll leave it at that,
[00:22:53.021 --> 00:22:55.243]  Keep seeing really scary stuff going on at the base.
[00:22:55.283 --> 00:23:09.093]  He sent us some photos of lockdown cities, of collapse, of the highway shut down, of the military training for all sorts of draw and quarter and confiscation, blockading of cities and roads.
[00:23:09.554 --> 00:23:11.115]  He sent us some photos we're going to show you.
[00:23:11.155 --> 00:23:17.420]  They took with his GoPro from the highway, but he directed us to the YouTube website of Guardian Centers.
[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:23.442]  Which is the privately owned facility that gets government contracts where this is going on.
[00:23:23.502 --> 00:23:25.462]  Now, this does not reflect on Guardian Centers.
[00:23:25.742 --> 00:23:29.684]  They've got all sorts of legitimate firefighter, police training, military training going on there.
[00:23:30.244 --> 00:23:32.505]  The issue is the training, not the center.
[00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:46.329]  The specifics of their own video about Guardian Center shows us hidden in plain view in between the images of the fire department getting people out of flooded cities to the military
[00:23:47.572 --> 00:23:55.360]  Apprehending, arresting citizens and handing them over to the police, just like we saw in Katrina with the gun confiscation that they first tried to deny.
[00:23:55.820 --> 00:24:02.446]  That's the issue, is that we've been told by the military, we have the documents, we've covered it, that the military is training for national gun confiscation.
[00:24:03.507 --> 00:24:09.193]  It's already begun in many different states like New York and California.
[00:24:09.593 --> 00:24:12.055]  And again, they don't want this being debated, they just want it to slowly
[00:24:13.163 --> 00:24:15.805]  The Pentagon wants authority to post almost 400,000 military personnel in the U.S.
[00:24:15.826 --> 00:24:16.306]  from the progressive.
[00:24:16.326 --> 00:24:18.388]  But it was also in the Associated Press at the time.
[00:24:18.728 --> 00:24:22.211]  And they are now moving the troops back out of the Middle East and other areas.
[00:24:35.239 --> 00:24:43.444]  To the United States for what they call Brigade Homeland, that is famously also in the Stars and Stripes and Army Times.
[00:24:43.744 --> 00:24:45.385]  Here's another one, Clarksville online.
[00:24:45.405 --> 00:24:49.128]  101 airborne soldiers to conduct air assault training in Troy, Tennessee.
[00:24:49.528 --> 00:24:54.431]  Again, this is all conditioning the public, the troops, everybody to just accept this.
[00:24:54.751 --> 00:24:56.332]  So the troops aren't villains in this.
[00:24:56.352 --> 00:24:59.414]  In fact, they're the most awake group out there because of this going on.
[00:25:00.775 --> 00:25:01.696]  We're talking about the training.
[00:25:02.665 --> 00:25:05.408]  That's being directed from the White House to the National Security Council.
[00:25:05.808 --> 00:25:07.971]  Not about guardian centers, not about the troops.
[00:25:07.991 --> 00:25:09.072]  I want to be clear.
[00:25:09.092 --> 00:25:14.378]  Because we've learned the propaganda they use on the police and military is, see, they're criticizing you and you're just trying to help people.
[00:25:15.114 --> 00:25:20.037]  No, we're pointing out what's going on inside of these larger operations.
[00:25:20.537 --> 00:25:21.518]  The real operations.
[00:25:21.978 --> 00:25:22.559]  Here's another one.
[00:25:22.599 --> 00:25:27.742]  Accepting FEMA camp prisoners for illegal immigrants justifies them for Americans.
[00:25:27.762 --> 00:25:34.326]  We're going to go through this then get to the footage of the black people being thrown in basically the FEMA center, the mock FEMA center.
[00:25:35.867 --> 00:25:36.487]  Again, back in 2011.
[00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:50.470]  We posted articles warning of the fact that under Rex 84, which is a public plan, they would use the collapse of borders as a pretext to suspend the Constitution and bring in martial law.
[00:25:51.946 --> 00:25:59.550]  And at the Guardian Centers, the training is moving towards what is clearly civil emergency or martial law.
[00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:18.960]  And right here in this article from two years ago, where they were finishing the center, they admit they have a whole area to simulate New Orleans Ninth Ward and what was done there and to be submerged just like Katrina, just like the gun confiscation that we witnessed there.
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:22.281]  There's also a CNN article that breaks this down.
[00:26:23.002 --> 00:26:25.443]  Take a tour of the Doomsday Disneyland.
[00:26:26.063 --> 00:26:31.926]  And again, that is this Guardian Center's facility, one of the largest in the world, where this is going on.
[00:26:31.946 --> 00:26:32.626]  And here's the issue.
[00:26:32.866 --> 00:26:34.427]  Why don't they use military bases for this?
[00:26:34.887 --> 00:26:40.890]  Because it's not traditional and sends up red flags to have police and military.
[00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:45.894]  Together, training at a military base, even though that's going on covertly.
[00:26:46.394 --> 00:26:49.337]  So, they're now doing it at these giant private centers.
[00:26:49.837 --> 00:26:53.040]  Now, let's go to the big enchilada before we get to the video.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:58.845]  Interment Resettlement Operations, we broke this a couple years ago, when it was sent to us by military sources.
[00:26:59.946 --> 00:27:05.731]  After that happened, they posted it on army.mil, kind of, oh, it's no big deal, see, you got a secret document, we'll just put it out.
[00:27:06.491 --> 00:27:06.952]  No big deal.
[00:27:07.967 --> 00:27:11.571]  Like catching your neighbor walking out with your television and they claim they were taking it to have it repaired or something.
[00:27:11.891 --> 00:27:13.113]  Oh, it's no big deal, Bob.
[00:27:13.133 --> 00:27:15.756]  Or you catch your neighbor in bed with your wife.
[00:27:15.836 --> 00:27:17.878]  Oh, I was just doing a gynecology exam.
[00:27:18.398 --> 00:27:20.100]  They released FM 3-39.40 and this document
[00:27:23.911 --> 00:27:26.892]  She has social security numbers, how to round up the American people.
[00:27:26.952 --> 00:27:36.417]  We have articles on InfoWars.com about it where you can see the subsections where more than 20 times it says American citizens, social security numbers, how to process, how to get our biometrics.
[00:27:36.697 --> 00:27:39.098]  It's like we were citizens of Fallujah, Iraq.
[00:27:39.138 --> 00:27:40.879]  It goes through all of it.
[00:27:41.039 --> 00:27:43.360]  First they tried to deny it, then they admitted it.
[00:27:43.921 --> 00:27:46.442]  We've also seen training in places like
[00:27:47.142 --> 00:27:56.024]  Arcadia, Iowa, where they said in the paper, they're working with a local gun shop and the citizens do door-to-door gun confiscation drill for training here in America.
[00:27:56.604 --> 00:27:59.205]  Once that blew up, they started to back off.
[00:27:59.945 --> 00:28:15.128]  We got the governor to respond in Tennessee a few years ago when they had regular army with National Guard, state police, ATF, the FBI, local police, all putting them under a unified federal FEMA command running an illegal checkpoint on one of the major highway searching vehicles.
[00:28:16.008 --> 00:28:21.833]  So again, this is just changing the culture, bringing all of this in.
[00:28:22.353 --> 00:28:27.998]  But I want to play from a promotional video put out by Guardian Centers.
[00:28:29.219 --> 00:28:30.920]  Some of the video for you right now.
[00:28:31.901 --> 00:28:45.746]  And we've been showing some of it as well while I've been talking here, where, again, interspersed with the firefighters and other legitimate things, it shows the military rounding people up, and every one of them is black.
[00:28:46.526 --> 00:28:48.027]  Now that's newsworthy right there.
[00:28:49.607 --> 00:28:56.530]  I've been to these drills where they all are farmers, wearing John Deere caps and stuff, saying, you know, you can't take my land, you can't take my guns.
[00:28:57.649 --> 00:28:58.650]  Very scary stuff.
[00:28:59.191 --> 00:29:01.412]  But it was a black farmer, white farmer, Hispanic farmer.
[00:29:02.293 --> 00:29:04.135]  Little extra black folks.
[00:29:04.215 --> 00:29:08.619]  I mean, obviously saying, oh, it's for Al-Qaeda, that's a bad group, but it's really for all Americans.
[00:29:09.059 --> 00:29:12.102]  Oh, well, blacks, you know, they're kind of looked down on quietly by some people.
[00:29:12.382 --> 00:29:13.963]  Oh, look, it's for blacks, so it's okay.
[00:29:14.404 --> 00:29:16.265]  And it's military and white guys.
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:23.403]  White civilians looking on as groups of blacks tump over cars and, you know, get rounded up and thrown behind barbed wire.
[00:29:23.463 --> 00:29:25.043]  I mean, this is pretty outrageous.
[00:29:25.524 --> 00:29:29.705]  But don't expect Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton, the race baiters, to say anything.
[00:29:30.566 --> 00:29:39.990]  They're just there to create more racial division in this country, not actually point out that there's preparation to target black communities, which are under gun control like Chicago and has the highest crime rate in the world.
[00:29:41.141 --> 00:29:46.349]  Which are under the fake drug war that's bringing down Chicago, just like Mexico's collapsing.
[00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:50.195]  It's the policies that are causing this cultural collapse.
[00:29:50.235 --> 00:29:53.841]  But here's some of the promotional video, hiding in plain view.
[00:30:21.664 --> 00:30:26.868]  Let me show you just a few more articles that will give you a larger picture as we connect the dots here.
[00:30:26.888 --> 00:30:39.940]  Then we're going to go to Staff Sergeant, retired Joe Biggs, to specifically analyze some of this video that shows regular Army engaging in civilian suppression, basically, nor the way to describe it.
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.964]  Look at this headline from today that was picked up by DrugsReport.com.
[00:30:44.004 --> 00:30:47.949]  We're going to show a short clip from the larger newscast here in just a moment.
[00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:56.440]  Armed Homeland Security agents in community outreach to let people know they're in the area and to remind them about the snitch program.
[00:30:57.021 --> 00:30:58.463]  And we'll go ahead and play a clip of that now.
[00:30:58.916 --> 00:31:01.017]  Again, it is essential to understand, we are seeing an explosion
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:27.682]  Of paramilitary preparation for gun confiscation, martial law, round-up, civil unrest, you name it.
[00:31:28.023 --> 00:31:29.703]  Is it the border being collapsed by design?
[00:31:29.723 --> 00:31:30.304]  Is that part of it?
[00:31:30.664 --> 00:31:30.984]  Clearly.
[00:31:31.484 --> 00:31:33.805]  Is it the dollar being deserted worldwide by design?
[00:31:34.085 --> 00:31:34.426]  Clearly.
[00:31:34.746 --> 00:31:37.027]  Is it war in Ukraine and possible war with Russia?
[00:31:37.747 --> 00:31:38.107]  Clearly.
[00:31:39.128 --> 00:31:45.571]  The issue is it's George Soros and the Globalist, on record, bragging they're behind the open borders and the Open Border Society.
[00:31:46.687 --> 00:31:51.129]  That they're behind the Ukraine takeover, that they're behind ISIS and the Arab Spring.
[00:31:51.869 --> 00:31:55.131]  I mean, they are starting what appears to be the beginning of World War III right now.
[00:31:56.712 --> 00:32:02.094]  That's where all this leads, and the government is on full drill to lock everything down and come after the American people.
[00:32:03.195 --> 00:32:05.156]  So this is really an emergency alert here.
[00:32:06.156 --> 00:32:16.221]  And again, a few years ago, we saw these weird internal Homeland Security training videos, and then public ones about see something, say something, where every terrorist was a white business executive.
[00:32:17.065 --> 00:32:18.706]  And I said they're rebranding to the Tea Party.
[00:32:18.766 --> 00:32:19.086]  Watch.
[00:32:19.226 --> 00:32:20.126]  And they've done that now.
[00:32:20.146 --> 00:32:21.286]  I mean, you can see it.
[00:32:21.686 --> 00:32:24.567]  First internal, saying our new enemy is the Tea Party, white people.
[00:32:26.548 --> 00:32:27.448]  Then it goes public.
[00:32:28.088 --> 00:32:29.169]  Then it becomes policy.
[00:32:29.449 --> 00:32:31.689]  People said, oh, you're just being racist, worrying about white people.
[00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:32.010]  No.
[00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:39.412]  If there's videos where all the terrorists are white people, and then internally they say the enemy is the Tea Party and gun owners,
[00:32:40.615 --> 00:32:42.116]  You know what's next, and we were proven right.
[00:32:42.536 --> 00:32:46.719]  Well, when it's showing nothing but black people, I've got a big concern as well.
[00:32:47.419 --> 00:32:54.524]  I've got a concern if it was showing black, white, Hispanic, Asian, but they're doing it to kind of sell the idea of, well, this is a troublemaking group.
[00:32:54.924 --> 00:32:55.985]  The Army's only for them.
[00:32:56.405 --> 00:32:58.827]  So the general public will accept it.
[00:33:01.363 --> 00:33:04.004]  They're showing minority communities that we're going to take the rights of whitey.
[00:33:04.664 --> 00:33:10.107]  And they're showing, you know, the law enforcement, you know, community that's in some areas, I guess, a white bastion or whatever.
[00:33:10.667 --> 00:33:12.168]  Oh, it's for the blacks.
[00:33:12.708 --> 00:33:15.389]  No, folks, it's for everybody.
[00:33:15.869 --> 00:33:24.933]  Who was the German preacher that said first they came for the communists and I wasn't a communist, said nothing, and then they came for the labor unions, I wasn't a labor union, then they came for me and there was no one else to stand up?
[00:33:25.854 --> 00:33:26.814]  This is for everybody.
[00:33:27.474 --> 00:33:29.595]  This is about taking your pension funds, it's about taking over.
[00:33:31.235 --> 00:33:35.136]  You can look up, again, the Army Times, you name it, admitting that they want to set up brigade homeland.
[00:33:35.156 --> 00:33:35.976]  That was six years ago.
[00:33:36.296 --> 00:33:37.016]  They've now done it.
[00:33:37.337 --> 00:33:38.197]  They're rolling it out.
[00:33:38.757 --> 00:33:39.717]  I mentioned this article.
[00:33:39.757 --> 00:33:42.198]  Guardsmen to conduct urban training at Arcadia in April.
[00:33:42.478 --> 00:33:49.400]  They admitted gun confiscation, drilling here, and they got all upset when we said that and reported on it and said that they hadn't said that.
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:50.640]  We have the Colonel on.
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:56.903]  We've also got FEMA camp prisoners, again we mentioned that, using the illegals to prime that pump.
[00:33:57.523 --> 00:34:00.905]  We have the governor responding and saying the feds can't do that anymore after Tennessee.
[00:34:01.326 --> 00:34:14.313]  So that's the good news is that you can say no to all this, but for those that are in denial about posse comitatus and what the NDAA has changed in the last few years incrementally to where there's nothing left,
[00:34:15.359 --> 00:34:24.310]  I wanted to go to Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, retired, to give us his breakdown because he served in Iraq and Afghanistan with a lot of the groups that are now coming home.
[00:34:25.495 --> 00:34:34.280]  To literally go after the American people as veterans can't get health care and are getting the word they can't buy guns anymore with no evidence or no reason at all.
[00:34:34.581 --> 00:34:44.727]  This is now pointed at us and the military appreciates these transmissions because on average I can't imagine a group more informed than Army and Marines, Air Force, you name it.
[00:34:45.067 --> 00:34:47.128]  Because again, they're decompartmentalized.
[00:34:47.148 --> 00:34:47.909]  They're in the middle of this.
[00:34:48.269 --> 00:34:49.109]  They see what's happening.
[00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:53.092]  Joe, before you analyze these patches for folks, I want to get your take overall.
[00:34:53.112 --> 00:34:54.693]  You've been sitting here tonight while we're
[00:34:55.413 --> 00:35:01.859]  Well, one of the things I like that you said is that the veterans overseas are getting ready to come home to this, and it reminded me of the past few days.
[00:35:01.879 --> 00:35:03.380]  I have a buddy who's stationed in Japan.
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.142]  I've got another that's in Afghanistan.
[00:35:17.574 --> 00:35:24.300]  They can't see a lot of these websites, and they're coming to me and saying, hey Joe, what's really happening in America right now?
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.481]  What's going on at the border?
[00:35:25.842 --> 00:35:28.784]  Why is our police being militarized so much?
[00:35:29.713 --> 00:35:32.594]  And I have to tell them, and it breaks their heart every single time.
[00:35:32.914 --> 00:35:34.574]  They're like, why is this happening right now?
[00:35:34.854 --> 00:35:37.395]  Am I really going to come home to this right now?
[00:35:37.735 --> 00:35:40.556]  And they're scared of what's happening to America right now.
[00:35:40.836 --> 00:35:41.636]  And I don't blame them.
[00:35:41.696 --> 00:35:42.556]  Because they're not traitors.
[00:35:42.836 --> 00:35:43.397]  Yeah, they're not.
[00:35:43.417 --> 00:35:44.857]  They don't want anything to do with this.
[00:35:45.437 --> 00:35:48.738]  You know, most of them go over there, like I said, for a good purpose.
[00:35:48.778 --> 00:35:51.519]  You know, a lot of them want the college, the benefits, something like that.
[00:35:51.559 --> 00:35:55.540]  None of them want to go and come back and be trained to take over cities here in America.
[00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:56.620]  No one has that.
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:57.661]  No one wants to do that.
[00:35:57.681 --> 00:35:59.983]  Well, a lot of them do it because of family, like your dad.
[00:36:00.163 --> 00:36:01.244]  Yeah, my father.
[00:36:01.284 --> 00:36:03.466]  I mean, it was in my blood to join the military.
[00:36:04.227 --> 00:36:05.968]  My father did it, my great-grandfather.
[00:36:06.529 --> 00:36:09.051]  And it's just something that we did in our family.
[00:36:09.111 --> 00:36:10.713]  If you were male, you joined the military.
[00:36:11.914 --> 00:36:12.935]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:36:13.355 --> 00:36:22.544]  And a lot of these guys are seeing what's happening back here, and it's literally breaking their heart every day to know that our country is slipping away while they're over there fighting for their country.
[00:36:23.697 --> 00:36:28.460]  Well, I want Joe, the people that are running this, to know that they're not doing this in the dark.
[00:36:29.481 --> 00:36:32.423]  The military is over 85% awake.
[00:36:33.284 --> 00:36:34.025]  That's what I've found.
[00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:35.205]  Even officers on the street.
[00:36:35.265 --> 00:36:35.786]  Oh, I agree.
[00:36:36.606 --> 00:36:37.027]  Completely.
[00:36:37.707 --> 00:36:42.231]  Everybody I've talked to is 100% with the information we're putting out, they're saying that's spot on.
[00:36:43.952 --> 00:36:45.533]  What do you think the establishment's thinking?
[00:36:45.553 --> 00:36:46.514]  I mean, they're not going to get away with this.
[00:36:47.541 --> 00:36:48.322]  I just don't understand.
[00:36:48.382 --> 00:36:51.444]  I mean, this video we're about to show, it's not National Guard.
[00:36:51.744 --> 00:36:54.265]  That's their job to take care of stuff here back in the homeland.
[00:36:54.546 --> 00:37:01.250]  This is Big Army, Regular Army, 3rd Infantry Division, 1st Cavalry, 1st Armored Division.
[00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:02.370]  This is the tip of the spear?
[00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:02.611]  Yes.
[00:37:03.431 --> 00:37:04.552]  Explain to folks what that means.
[00:37:04.652 --> 00:37:05.653]  This is not just regular army.
[00:37:05.873 --> 00:37:07.694]  This is the absolute shock forces.
[00:37:07.914 --> 00:37:08.154]  Yes.
[00:37:08.915 --> 00:37:10.696]  3rd ID is one of the biggest infantry units.
[00:37:10.736 --> 00:37:12.017]  They are some of the first ones to go in.
[00:37:12.617 --> 00:37:14.939]  1st Armored Division is one of the biggest armored.
[00:37:15.379 --> 00:37:17.780]  You know, your tanks, your paladins, things like that.
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:21.002]  And 1st Cavalry is one of the biggest cavalry divisions there is.
[00:37:21.463 --> 00:37:29.768]  So they've got the three biggest guys in there right now training at this place for, you know, an apparent martial law takeover.
[00:37:30.028 --> 00:37:30.789]  It's unbelievable.
[00:37:31.843 --> 00:37:33.583]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:37:33.663 --> 00:37:34.644]  It's really happening.
[00:37:34.664 --> 00:37:37.924]  We've seen the signs for a long time, but it was over the horizon.
[00:37:37.984 --> 00:37:39.485]  Now it's in our face.
[00:37:40.365 --> 00:37:46.927]  And before we get to these patches, a little bit of gallows humor here, some comic relief, but it's also a good analogy.
[00:37:47.687 --> 00:37:51.408]  If you think about the first Ghostbusters movie, I think it's a great comedy.
[00:37:52.268 --> 00:37:56.089]  They're talking about normal paranormal activity being the size of a Twinkie.
[00:37:57.469 --> 00:38:01.370]  And now the paranormal activity is the size of a giant, you know, 20, 40 foot long Twinkie.
[00:38:01.857 --> 00:38:08.239]  Well, let's say this Twinkie represents the normal amount of psychokinetic energy in the New York area.
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:16.202]  According to this morning's sample, it would be a Twinkie 35 feet long, weighing approximately 600 pounds.
[00:38:17.783 --> 00:38:18.623]  That's a big Twinkie.
[00:38:20.064 --> 00:38:23.565]  Normal paramilitary activity in a free society doesn't exist.
[00:38:24.165 --> 00:38:25.026]  It isn't going on.
[00:38:25.846 --> 00:38:28.807]  Now it's just off the charts giant, is the point.
[00:38:29.247 --> 00:38:31.128]  And it's accelerating, it's building.
[00:38:32.833 --> 00:38:38.514]  You can see it, it's like an enemy army lining up against your border for war, but it's not even a foreign country.
[00:38:39.034 --> 00:38:40.915]  It's our own military, that's why they're freaking out.
[00:38:40.935 --> 00:38:42.915]  Do you think that's a good analogy, Joe?
[00:38:43.195 --> 00:38:43.735]  Oh, definitely.
[00:38:43.755 --> 00:38:55.157]  I mean, it's... Just imagine opening up and you're sitting in your house and you hear explosions, you hear helicopters flying overhead, and you peek through your blind real quick and you look outside, and it's U.S.
[00:38:55.197 --> 00:38:58.718]  military, it's army, with American flags on their shoulders, and you're sitting there like,
[00:38:59.861 --> 00:39:00.963]  Why are you on our streets?
[00:39:00.983 --> 00:39:01.724]  What are you doing here?
[00:39:01.824 --> 00:39:03.386]  And they admit that's to acclimate everyone.
[00:39:03.406 --> 00:39:04.407]  Look at the Boston bombing.
[00:39:04.427 --> 00:39:04.968]  Hey, ease it in.
[00:39:05.008 --> 00:39:05.589]  You ease it in.
[00:39:05.929 --> 00:39:06.811]  Look at the Boston bombing.
[00:39:06.831 --> 00:39:07.772]  Going to everybody's houses.
[00:39:08.313 --> 00:39:09.414]  Oh, you're a black lady.
[00:39:09.454 --> 00:39:10.275]  You're a blonde haired lady.
[00:39:10.295 --> 00:39:11.877]  You look nothing like the guy we're looking for.
[00:39:12.078 --> 00:39:13.440]  We're going to drag you out with a gun to your head.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.102]  We're going to drive around pointing guns at you.
[00:39:15.122 --> 00:39:16.223]  It's all a power grab.
[00:39:17.133 --> 00:39:20.496]  Yeah, it's a mind-blowing.
[00:39:20.536 --> 00:39:23.898]  Every day that something passes like this, I just don't understand how we're getting to this.
[00:39:24.018 --> 00:39:25.179]  What does your gut tell you?
[00:39:25.259 --> 00:39:32.145]  Is it all of the collapsing border, the dollar, the stage takeover, or is it one of those things, the collapsing border war with Russia?
[00:39:32.465 --> 00:39:34.287]  Why do you think they've got this in such high gear?
[00:39:35.233 --> 00:39:39.036]  Well, the thing with the border, I'm thinking they want to import this poverty.
[00:39:39.596 --> 00:39:45.980]  They want to, essentially, we're pulling the Border Patrol agents away from the border, and then they're talking about bringing in National Guard.
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.161]  So what does that do?
[00:39:47.201 --> 00:39:48.542]  That starts scaring people.
[00:39:48.902 --> 00:39:52.044]  You start seeing National Guard up and down the streets, you're thinking martial law.
[00:39:52.104 --> 00:39:52.704]  It's the cover!
[00:39:52.724 --> 00:39:54.846]  It's the cover to be in the first phase, I agree.
[00:39:55.386 --> 00:39:55.786]  Completely.
[00:39:56.207 --> 00:40:18.781]  Once that happens on the border and it becomes everyday norm that you're seeing the tanks rolling up and down the streets, the Humvees, the MRAPs, the soldiers with the M4s strapped to their chests, next thing you have these guys, the big army, coming in, the 1st Armored Division, the 1st Cav, 3rd Infantry Division, these guys will be on the streets in the MRAPs along with the militarized police as well.
[00:40:20.062 --> 00:40:20.843]  God Almighty.
[00:40:22.028 --> 00:40:25.811]  And the public will think they're here to help with the collapse.
[00:40:25.851 --> 00:40:26.551]  Protect and serve.
[00:40:26.571 --> 00:40:27.071]  It's protect and serve.
[00:40:27.432 --> 00:40:30.534]  And then it will set the precedent that we're permanently under martial law.
[00:40:30.634 --> 00:40:31.755]  Yeah, completely.
[00:40:31.775 --> 00:40:33.356]  That's exactly what they're going for.
[00:40:33.476 --> 00:40:35.217]  But they're going to call it civil emergency.
[00:40:35.817 --> 00:40:38.980]  Once it happens, most of these people that are asleep and sheeple,
[00:40:40.113 --> 00:40:40.854]  They won't even care.
[00:40:40.874 --> 00:40:42.755]  Because it's gradually happened.
[00:40:43.035 --> 00:40:46.077]  The people who are awake right now, we're the ones that are pulling our hair out every day.
[00:40:46.457 --> 00:40:47.397]  You know, distressed out.
[00:40:47.417 --> 00:40:48.698]  We see the tyranny.
[00:40:48.738 --> 00:40:49.619]  We see what's happening.
[00:40:50.139 --> 00:40:51.360]  These guys aren't even paying attention.
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:52.540]  When it happens, they won't even care.
[00:40:53.321 --> 00:41:00.365]  They're bringing us into a permanent emergency and the groups that are waking up are political people that are savvy patriots because we're the targets.
[00:41:01.451 --> 00:41:06.352]  Of the next phase and the police and military because they know this is not, this was not legal just a few years ago.
[00:41:07.033 --> 00:41:08.533]  They had to change laws to do this.
[00:41:08.953 --> 00:41:11.854]  Well one of the things they're doing though too is the failed VA.
[00:41:12.594 --> 00:41:14.915]  What happens when you can't get your veterans the healthcare they need?
[00:41:14.975 --> 00:41:15.615]  They don't get better.
[00:41:15.875 --> 00:41:17.216]  They can't fight back.
[00:41:17.356 --> 00:41:18.176]  You just make them the enemy.
[00:41:18.496 --> 00:41:19.196]  They can't fight back.
[00:41:19.236 --> 00:41:20.657]  You're taking enemy away.
[00:41:20.977 --> 00:41:21.537]  That's what they're doing.
[00:41:21.557 --> 00:41:22.037]  They're planning.
[00:41:22.057 --> 00:41:23.957]  They're saying, hey, these guys are trained.
[00:41:23.977 --> 00:41:26.358]  They have the information, the knowledge to defeat us.
[00:41:26.678 --> 00:41:30.019]  We're going to deny them the health care they need so they can't fight back.
[00:41:30.239 --> 00:41:38.421]  When we roll in this martial law, these guys will be dead in the street basically, laying there, internal bleeding, whatever's going on, unable to fight back after so long.
[00:41:38.581 --> 00:41:39.521]  You're talking about yourself.
[00:41:39.542 --> 00:41:55.490]  What do you think of the illegals in South Texas to get this $60 million facility where they have $1,000 rooms and with spas, hot tubs, tennis courts down there at a luxury facility that the government's about to buy for them?
[00:41:56.070 --> 00:42:00.412]  We're opening up all these centers for these illegal aliens, but we're not doing anything for homeless veterans.
[00:42:00.432 --> 00:42:05.555]  We're not doing anything for Americans in general who need the help of America.
[00:42:06.104 --> 00:42:06.925]  They're not doing anything.
[00:42:06.945 --> 00:42:12.510]  Well, look at how they're turning off the power plant, shipping our jobs overseas, devaluing the dollar.
[00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:13.832]  They are destroying this country.
[00:42:14.372 --> 00:42:16.034]  In closing, let's look at some of these patches, Joe.
[00:42:16.054 --> 00:42:19.137]  All right, so some of the video right here you're going to see is pretty disturbing.
[00:42:19.738 --> 00:42:25.483]  Actual big army out here training to put people into FEMA camps, essentially.
[00:42:25.804 --> 00:42:26.404]  You will have
[00:42:27.375 --> 00:42:31.959]  Then taking them into custody, detaining them, and handing them over to police to be held.
[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:35.162]  So right here we have a 3rd Infantry Division patch.
[00:42:35.643 --> 00:42:39.507]  You'll also see a 1st Armored Division, which is out of El Paso, Texas.
[00:42:40.027 --> 00:42:42.569]  And then you'll see a 1st Cavalry Division patch as well.
[00:42:44.451 --> 00:42:46.253]  Helicopters coming in, soldiers.
[00:42:48.495 --> 00:42:49.456]  It looks fine and dandy.
[00:42:49.476 --> 00:42:51.078]  Then you got the Constantino wire right here.
[00:42:52.304 --> 00:43:03.467]  Soldier, white guy, actually fighting an African-American citizen, getting her, trying to detain her until the cops can come and put her in a camp.
[00:43:04.808 --> 00:43:05.408]  And there you go.
[00:43:06.288 --> 00:43:09.669]  This is what's happening right now in our backyard every day.
[00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:13.070]  And then as you watch longer, they're all black.
[00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:14.271]  Look, you got black guys right there.
[00:43:14.691 --> 00:43:18.552]  Yeah, they're the only ones that flip over cars and go and riot, apparently.
[00:43:21.513 --> 00:43:22.073]  Then they burn it.
[00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:29.231]  These centers are popping up everywhere right now.
[00:43:29.751 --> 00:43:31.051]  The one that we saw in Virginia.
[00:43:31.471 --> 00:43:37.833]  There's the Marine Base one now that looks more like a rural, suburbia kind with the churches and all that as well.
[00:43:38.133 --> 00:43:39.013]  And now we have this.
[00:43:39.713 --> 00:43:41.134]  This is even more in-depth.
[00:43:41.214 --> 00:43:43.794]  This is completely mind-blowing.
[00:43:43.894 --> 00:43:51.056]  It gives me chills watching this to see the lengths they're going to, the training they have, that they're going through to bring this to our country on our streets.
[00:43:52.602 --> 00:43:54.824]  We're going to continue to follow this tomorrow on the radio, 11 a.m.
[00:43:54.844 --> 00:43:55.525]  to 2 p.m.
[00:43:55.565 --> 00:43:59.409]  Again, this is extended, expanded coverage here on InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:01.992]  These are the times that try men and women's souls.
[00:44:03.033 --> 00:44:04.295]  I've only scratched the surface here.
[00:44:04.315 --> 00:44:05.456]  You've got to go read FM.
[00:44:07.751 --> 00:44:13.234]  3-39.40 where it says it's for you and your family and how they're going to break up the families inside the camps.
[00:44:14.195 --> 00:44:18.337]  This nightmare will come true if we don't wake up from it and say no.
[00:44:19.038 --> 00:44:20.379]  It's just that simple.
[00:44:20.659 --> 00:44:26.763]  The good news is the military knows how illegal this is, knows how bad it is, but
[00:44:27.603 --> 00:44:28.585]  Can they get the word out?
[00:44:28.625 --> 00:44:29.446]  Can we get the word out?
[00:44:29.466 --> 00:44:30.208]  Can you get the word out?
[00:44:30.528 --> 00:44:32.171]  And what do we call this report tonight?
[00:44:32.952 --> 00:44:34.775]  Obama preparing martial law?
[00:44:36.979 --> 00:44:37.540]  Big army?
[00:44:38.141 --> 00:44:38.862]  Regular army?
[00:44:38.943 --> 00:44:41.086]  Or army trains to take on black Americans?
[00:44:43.595 --> 00:44:46.116]  I mean, there's so many things in this story.
[00:44:47.216 --> 00:44:49.437]  Preparations for martial law goes into high gear.
[00:44:51.078 --> 00:44:51.538]  Breaking.
[00:44:52.278 --> 00:44:52.878]  Video.
[00:44:54.459 --> 00:44:56.060]  Because see, so much of this is headlines.
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:45:01.262]  And I share with you our knowledge, as viewers, of our frustrations.
[00:45:01.302 --> 00:45:06.163]  Because my problem is I underestimate how bad things are.
[00:45:06.243 --> 00:45:07.604]  I don't exaggerate most of the time.
[00:45:10.129 --> 00:45:18.736]  That's rare when we get it wrong and say that it's, you know, worse than it actually is.
[00:45:19.576 --> 00:45:21.518]  It's usually much worse than we even thought.
[00:45:21.598 --> 00:45:24.520]  So, I don't even know how to respond to this treason.
[00:45:25.001 --> 00:45:28.824]  Joe, in closing, what should we call this report tonight?
[00:45:29.204 --> 00:45:30.345]  There's so much going on right here.
[00:45:30.365 --> 00:45:32.847]  There's so much that it's hard to pinpoint one thing.
[00:45:33.887 --> 00:45:34.268]  It's just...
[00:45:36.101 --> 00:45:42.647]  Well, you saw that clip earlier where they go, we're just here to let you know we're here as federal police and to watch your neighbors.
[00:45:42.887 --> 00:45:44.208]  I mean, it's Twilight Zone.
[00:45:44.308 --> 00:45:45.929]  It's direct authoritarianism.
[00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:51.934]  Ladies and gentlemen, send this video that we'll later post on YouTube at InfoWars.com to your friends and family.
[00:45:51.994 --> 00:45:52.775]  Send it to Congress.
[00:45:53.215 --> 00:45:54.456]  Send it to other radio hosts.
[00:45:55.217 --> 00:45:58.158]  If Americans want any future, we better reverse this.
[00:45:58.198 --> 00:46:00.339]  This is not security, this is insecurity.
[00:46:00.739 --> 00:46:06.701]  This is being done so they can politically break this country's back and make us domesticated slaves.
[00:46:06.861 --> 00:46:09.202]  Bottom line, that's what this type of stuff is for.
[00:46:09.642 --> 00:46:10.942]  Well, that's it for this extended coverage.
[00:46:11.002 --> 00:46:12.303]  Great job to the incredible crew.
[00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:15.864]  Please continue to support us and your prayers until tomorrow.
[00:46:15.944 --> 00:46:19.225]  I'm Alex Jones signing off from the Infowars Media Center.
[00:46:20.712 --> 00:46:24.495]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[00:46:24.935 --> 00:46:26.136]  I didn't like taste dirt in it.
[00:46:26.196 --> 00:46:27.337]  God knows what's in this.
[00:46:27.477 --> 00:46:28.458]  This has an aftertaste.
[00:46:28.478 --> 00:46:30.079]  Tastes like Austin water?
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:31.180]  Yeah, it does.
[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:35.404]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[00:46:35.644 --> 00:46:41.789]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered for the ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[00:46:41.989 --> 00:46:42.710]  I call it H2O.
[00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:44.291]  That one is better.
[00:46:44.351 --> 00:46:45.332]  Tastes like nothing.
[00:46:45.512 --> 00:46:47.013]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[00:46:47.074 --> 00:46:47.594]  It's good water.
[00:46:47.674 --> 00:46:56.224]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, Monsanto's deadly pesticide, glyphosate, and many others.
[00:46:56.624 --> 00:47:04.133]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[00:47:04.413 --> 00:47:06.936]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[00:47:07.536 --> 00:47:09.819]  It has that processed flavor to it.
[00:47:10.179 --> 00:47:19.749]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances and many more, leaving only fresh tasting, deliciously clean water.
[00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:21.511]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[00:47:21.591 --> 00:47:22.272]  It's good water.
[00:47:22.944 --> 00:47:23.384]  Refreshing.
[00:47:23.825 --> 00:47:24.165]  It's good.

[00:47:40.506 --> 00:47:44.827]  You've experienced and heard about the benefits of Super Male Vitality.
[00:47:45.327 --> 00:47:47.828]  Now, the new formula has arrived.
[00:47:48.188 --> 00:47:52.069]  Introducing the new Super Female Vitality.

[00:48:19.522 --> 00:48:22.224]  This is Jakari Jackson for InfoWars.com.
[00:48:22.484 --> 00:48:23.285]  We're here in the St.
[00:48:23.325 --> 00:48:28.409]  Louis area, the areas that have been plagued by riots, protests, and also police brutality.
[00:48:28.669 --> 00:48:35.594]  But I want to bring your attention to something different here tonight, because we've talked about all those things, but let's talk about the lies of the mainstream media.
[00:48:35.894 --> 00:48:38.876]  This has come out on Fox 2 News now.
[00:48:39.217 --> 00:48:44.100]  It says, despite reports SWAT team helped Al Jazeera reporters did not take their equipment.
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:47.463]  And this is pretty much parodying a statement of the St.
[00:48:47.503 --> 00:48:49.124]  Charles County Sheriff's Department.
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:51.781]  And they said, no, we're not harming these journalists.
[00:48:52.002 --> 00:48:53.363]  We're not looting their equipment.
[00:48:53.643 --> 00:48:54.263]  We're helping them.
[00:48:54.303 --> 00:48:55.164]  Well, I was there.
[00:48:59.787 --> 00:49:00.967]  Infowars.com.
[00:49:01.748 --> 00:49:04.069]  The guys are coming in the trucks.
[00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:05.610]  They're coming to flank.
[00:49:07.532 --> 00:49:11.554]  Mommy, you don't have to.
[00:49:11.574 --> 00:49:12.475]  All right.
[00:49:14.076 --> 00:49:15.417]  So, here they come.
[00:49:18.690 --> 00:49:20.310]  Joe Biggs got shot with a rubber bullet.
[00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:23.111]  Because after having
[00:49:36.246 --> 00:49:38.427]  Multiple gas canisters fired at me.
[00:49:38.447 --> 00:49:40.549]  I had to jump in somebody's yard and run through.
[00:49:40.849 --> 00:49:43.750]  And lo and behold, I happened to run into Al Jazeera.
[00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:47.032]  There's also a local NBC affiliate out there as well.
[00:49:47.292 --> 00:49:49.574]  And they say they were helping, not harming Al Jazeera.
[00:49:49.774 --> 00:49:52.015]  You take a look at this footage and you tell me what you think.
[00:49:52.455 --> 00:49:54.076]  What's he doing at the news camera?
[00:49:54.316 --> 00:49:54.657]  Look!
[00:49:54.817 --> 00:49:56.698]  This is prank over here!
[00:49:58.499 --> 00:50:00.020]  He's shooting us!
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:01.080]  What's the bullet?
[00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:01.260]  Wow!
[00:50:01.421 --> 00:50:02.021]  Are you still on?
[00:50:04.741 --> 00:50:07.462]  There's media over here trying to cover the story!
[00:50:08.923 --> 00:50:09.223]  Hello?
[00:50:11.044 --> 00:50:14.586]  Yeah, well, we're getting shot at with rubber bullets right now, okay?
[00:50:14.646 --> 00:50:16.167]  So I don't know what to tell you.
[00:50:16.307 --> 00:50:17.148]  Yeah!
[00:50:17.428 --> 00:50:18.388]  That's a rubber bullet, bro.
[00:50:18.428 --> 00:50:19.669]  They've been shooting them at everybody.
[00:50:23.311 --> 00:50:23.431]  Okay.
[00:50:23.511 --> 00:50:28.494]  I mean, as of right now, we're okay until they start shooting rubber bullets in our direction.
[00:50:41.516 --> 00:50:42.036]  Whoa!
[00:50:42.076 --> 00:50:43.077]  They threw it at the news!
[00:50:43.157 --> 00:50:45.719]  Well, I'm news too, but you know what I'm talking about.
[00:50:45.739 --> 00:50:48.821]  We're moving!
[00:50:48.881 --> 00:50:51.663]  We're moving!
[00:50:51.943 --> 00:50:53.144]  Usher!
[00:50:53.184 --> 00:50:54.325]  Get Usher!
[00:50:54.365 --> 00:50:54.986]  Get out!
[00:50:55.786 --> 00:50:56.587]  Alright.
[00:50:56.627 --> 00:50:58.628]  Look, so they did it to the new media too.
[00:51:02.651 --> 00:51:03.472]  Usher!
[00:51:03.492 --> 00:51:04.873]  You got here, bro?
[00:51:05.093 --> 00:51:05.954]  Hey, who do you guys work for?
[00:51:07.093 --> 00:51:08.233]  We're with Al Jazeera America.
[00:51:08.313 --> 00:51:09.314]  Al Jazeera America.
[00:51:09.334 --> 00:51:11.794]  So they puff smoke at Al Jazeera America.
[00:51:13.695 --> 00:51:14.995]  They fired a rubber bullet at us.
[00:51:16.196 --> 00:51:17.756]  And then tear gassed us.
[00:51:17.776 --> 00:51:20.857]  They tear gassed Al Jazeera America.
[00:51:21.197 --> 00:51:23.118]  So you see, it's not just InfoWars.com.
[00:51:23.378 --> 00:51:25.158]  They're popping at anybody who's out here with a camera.
[00:51:25.958 --> 00:51:26.579]  So there it is.
[00:51:26.639 --> 00:51:27.339]  Proof positive.
[00:51:27.379 --> 00:51:28.939]  Them targeting reporters.
[00:51:28.979 --> 00:51:30.780]  But according to them, it never happened.
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:31.740]  They were just there to help.
[00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:47.239]  So they come and they tell you to turn your video camera off before they storm you, and then if they catch you with your video camera on, then they bomb you with the smoke grenades and then they shoot you with the rubber bullets, but everything's fine because the Sheriff's Department came out and said so.
[00:51:47.519 --> 00:51:50.401]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:51:51.377 --> 00:51:54.599]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com in Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:51:55.099 --> 00:51:56.921]  Now for the 8th day.
[00:51:57.541 --> 00:52:02.384]  We're going to continue to bring you up-to-date coverage of what is going on out here.
[00:52:03.025 --> 00:52:09.789]  One of the big questions for tonight, and pretty much every night, will the police attack the protesters?
[00:52:10.349 --> 00:52:15.231]  And if so, are they also going to infringe on the media's First Amendment rights?
[00:52:15.751 --> 00:52:18.292]  Because we've been seeing it more and more every day.
[00:52:18.312 --> 00:52:20.592]  Now, like I said, this is our eighth day here.
[00:52:20.893 --> 00:52:28.735]  This is the first time in the past few days we haven't had a designated media section right over here beside the McDonald's.
[00:52:28.755 --> 00:52:37.298]  They have completely cleared that out and they have only set up an area back at the Martial Law Command Center where you saw us last night.
[00:52:38.399 --> 00:52:42.146]  We're not sure who's a journalist and who's not.
[00:52:42.166 --> 00:52:46.093]  And yes, if I see somebody with a $50,000 camera on their shoulder, I'm pretty sure.
[00:52:50.377 --> 00:52:59.959]  It seems like there's a lot more activity tonight than there was last night, and that could be due to the fact that another person was yet killed again by a police officer.
[00:53:00.479 --> 00:53:08.760]  Justified or not, the people in this town have their emotions running high, and this could affect how things act the rest of the week.
[00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:10.080]  Hands up!
[00:53:11.381 --> 00:53:11.961]  Hands up!
[00:53:12.801 --> 00:53:19.142]  Right before everything turned into pure and total chaos in Ferguson, there was calm.
[00:53:26.735 --> 00:53:36.199]  Kip began investigating reports of provocateurs in the area around the time I came across a stash of glass bottles sitting under this metallic bin.
[00:53:37.079 --> 00:53:44.742]  Instead of getting shot by the cops because honestly I had walked across and kicked one and it just made my skin crawl.
[00:53:44.762 --> 00:53:49.885]  I was like oh my god they're gonna all hear that and they're just gonna start shooting rounds at me.
[00:53:51.249 --> 00:53:52.290]  I didn't pick up the bottle.
[00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:58.412]  Instead, I walked over to numerous officers and I said, hey, I don't want anything to break out here tonight.
[00:53:58.472 --> 00:54:10.498]  I don't want anything bad to happen, but I just want you to let you know I found a stash of glass bottles of the same brand, so they're not just random ones, and they're sitting under this bin over there, like, stacked together.
[00:54:11.478 --> 00:54:12.479]  They didn't do anything about it.
[00:54:12.679 --> 00:54:14.320]  The cops were more concerned
[00:54:15.319 --> 00:54:17.360]  But sweeping the media out of the area.
[00:54:17.941 --> 00:54:18.941]  So I'm sitting there for a second.
[00:54:19.001 --> 00:54:19.742]  It calms down.
[00:54:19.762 --> 00:54:25.946]  I run back to the road where there's this metal wire going across the sidewalk and I hear...
[00:54:46.126 --> 00:54:51.487]  And I'm sitting here looking and this police officer with no mask, no helmet, anything at all.
[00:54:51.787 --> 00:54:58.429]  He's just got an M4 in his hand and he's got it pointed within two inches of this guy with a camera.
[00:54:58.969 --> 00:55:01.090]  And he's sitting there saying that he was going to kill this guy.
[00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:02.470]  And he said, I'm media.
[00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:04.071]  And he goes, I don't effing care.
[00:55:05.350 --> 00:55:06.690]  What is going on?
[00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:15.412]  These guys are out of control and they keep telling you on mainstream media, on Fox, on CNN, oh you know it was a very peaceful night.
[00:55:15.552 --> 00:55:16.033]  Negative!
[00:55:16.073 --> 00:55:18.993]  It's peaceful until you guys get out of control.
[00:55:19.493 --> 00:55:21.454]  They started attacking journalists.
[00:55:21.594 --> 00:55:29.836]  I witnessed three journalists get thrown to the ground by multiple police officers and were punched
[00:55:30.496 --> 00:55:34.618]  Grabbed, wrangled, hog tied up, and carried out of there.
[00:55:35.138 --> 00:55:37.219]  Exercising their rights as media.
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:40.721]  They were moving when the cops told them to get out of their way.
[00:55:41.001 --> 00:55:45.223]  Since I've been here, it has been complete and total madness.
[00:55:45.524 --> 00:55:52.027]  The police are against the media because they know the truth will get out, and they do not want that to happen.
[00:55:53.439 --> 00:55:54.720]  What do you think about this, Captain?
[00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:56.361]  They're arresting journalists.
[00:55:56.441 --> 00:55:58.702]  Yesterday you told us they weren't arresting journalists.
[00:55:58.782 --> 00:56:01.883]  Now they're arresting journalists.
[00:56:01.943 --> 00:56:03.364]  Now you're arresting journalists.
[00:56:03.404 --> 00:56:05.185]  Sidewalk, please.
[00:56:05.505 --> 00:56:16.891]  I felt like such an environment that it was going to get so bad that I felt that I had to choose safety over footage at that point, and I had to get my team out of there.
[00:56:17.371 --> 00:56:19.492]  I don't like having my rights stripped away.
[00:56:19.512 --> 00:56:22.594]  I don't think anybody that lives in a free country likes that as well.
[00:56:23.732 --> 00:56:29.183]  You know, we're here to bring you, the viewer, the people, the truth as it happens.
[00:56:30.105 --> 00:56:33.612]  You know, and when they keep us from doing that, it sucks.
[00:56:49.195 --> 00:56:50.036]  The facts are in.
[00:56:50.216 --> 00:56:51.356]  The studies are legion.
[00:56:51.637 --> 00:56:58.982]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:56:59.162 --> 00:57:02.604]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:57:02.964 --> 00:57:03.384]  Simple.
[00:57:03.545 --> 00:57:07.968]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:57:08.268 --> 00:57:11.490]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet.
[00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:13.712]  But we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:57:13.972 --> 00:57:19.358]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars line fluoride shield formulation.
[00:57:19.518 --> 00:57:30.008]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:57:30.328 --> 00:57:32.170]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:34.533]  By blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[00:57:34.874 --> 00:57:36.716]  I use fluoride shield every day.
