[00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:13.994]  Many people use Wikipedia as a jump-off point for their research, but even Wiki will tell you that not all of their entries are up to snuff.
[00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:15.756]  Enter the federal government.
[00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:19.801]  The National Archives recently teamed up with Wiki for an edit-a-thon.
[00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:26.689]  Edit sessions are not unique, but when the government is involved, I'm concerned that they may be redacting more than editing.
[00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:33.754]  We've seen the supposedly transparent, press-friendly Obama administration's scheme to put government monitors in newsrooms.
[00:00:34.114 --> 00:00:38.397]  And if you call the FCC to ask about this, you get the runaround.
[00:00:38.657 --> 00:00:40.058]  David Knight with Free Speech Systems.
[00:00:40.118 --> 00:00:44.682]  I had some questions about the multi-market study of critical information needs.
[00:00:45.102 --> 00:00:47.203]  Do you have a moment that I could ask you a couple questions?
[00:00:48.785 --> 00:00:51.346]  Unfortunately, I'm not at liberty to answer any questions.
[00:00:51.406 --> 00:00:54.829]  You're certainly more than welcome to contact our Office of Media Relations, though.
[00:00:55.544 --> 00:00:55.864]  Oh, okay.
[00:00:55.884 --> 00:00:58.866]  You were listed on the FCC press release as a person to contact.
[00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:05.969]  Yes, and with respect to press inquiries, we're directing them now to our Office of Media Relations.
[00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:07.449]  Just one quick question.
[00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.270]  How come that changed?
[00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.212]  How come you decide not to field those questions anymore?
[00:01:14.312 --> 00:01:21.215]  Because we've just decided to route all of the media inquiries through that office for uniformity of response.
[00:01:22.556 --> 00:01:24.837]  University Office of Media Relations.
[00:01:25.646 --> 00:01:38.133]  Please leave a message.
[00:01:40.114 --> 00:01:43.436]  Hi Mr. Margolis, this is David Knight with Free Speech Systems.
[00:01:43.716 --> 00:01:48.739]  I'm calling you because I just called that number you gave me for the Office of Media Relations.
[00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:52.982]  I've called them three times and all I get is an answering machine like I'm getting now your number.
[00:01:55.663 --> 00:01:58.064]  Thank you for calling the FCC's Consumer Center.
[00:01:58.804 --> 00:02:02.646]  Sometimes agencies aren't that successful at stonewalling the press.
[00:02:03.086 --> 00:02:07.188]  It's come out that the CIA will now openly propagandize Americans.
[00:02:07.388 --> 00:02:11.110]  Very much illegal, but if you won't be held accountable, then why not?
[00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.453]  We've seen whistleblowers like Amber Lyons speak out about media censorship, but she's not the only one.
[00:02:17.893 --> 00:02:20.914]  And contributing to the growth of the alternative media, now we have this.
[00:02:21.354 --> 00:02:23.295]  Former CBS reporter agrees.
[00:02:23.655 --> 00:02:26.556]  Mainstream media manipulated, controlled by the establishment.
[00:02:26.976 --> 00:02:27.557]  And this is Ms.
[00:02:27.577 --> 00:02:30.618]  Cheryl Atkinson, who served as a correspondent with CNN.
[00:02:31.334 --> 00:02:36.278]  At my heart, I feel like I'm an investigative reporter, and that's what I can bring to the table and contribute.
[00:02:36.898 --> 00:02:41.322]  And quite frankly, in the last couple of years, there just wasn't the appetite for that kind of reporting.
[00:02:41.582 --> 00:02:58.915]  I'm seeking out now, which is sort of in flux, is the opportunity to bring underserved stories to a broad audience through an editorial process that doesn't censor, that doesn't try to direct a story to go in a certain unnatural direction, but lets the story be told the way the story naturally is occurring.
[00:02:59.255 --> 00:03:04.721]  But to the government's credit, they have promised to stop lying because of sites like Drudge Report.
[00:03:05.242 --> 00:03:05.843]  Yeah, right.
[00:03:06.163 --> 00:03:10.388]  We'll leave you with how the government-guided mainstream press keeps their narratives going.
[00:03:10.648 --> 00:03:13.392]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:03:14.693 --> 00:03:19.517]  A lot of times people say, I heard something on CNN and then I read it again in Time Magazine.
[00:03:19.577 --> 00:03:23.940]  Well, you recognize Time Warner owns both CNN and Time Magazine.
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.803]  Or they'll say, you know, I heard it on Fox and then I read it in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:03:27.823 --> 00:03:33.207]  Well, you can see Fox and Wall Street Journal both line up under the News Corporation and so on and so forth.
[00:03:33.227 --> 00:03:35.208]  You can do this all across the board.
[00:03:42.915 --> 00:03:43.736]  The facts are in.
[00:03:43.936 --> 00:03:45.057]  The studies are legion.
[00:03:45.337 --> 00:03:52.702]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:03:52.842 --> 00:03:58.226]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
[00:03:58.386 --> 00:04:08.893]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
