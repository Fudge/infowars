[00:00:01.912 --> 00:00:04.818]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:08.725]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:16.485 --> 00:00:17.126]  Big Brother.
[00:00:17.787 --> 00:00:18.828]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:19.549 --> 00:00:20.650]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:21.311 --> 00:00:22.112]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.913 --> 00:00:23.834]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.455 --> 00:00:28.080]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.706]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.076 --> 00:00:35.257]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:35.317 --> 00:00:36.697]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[00:00:37.158 --> 00:00:41.060]  We have a jam-packed show on this 1st of July, 2014.
[00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.984]  You know, we're coming up to the 4th of July this weekend, and I just saw a story on the BBC.
[00:00:48.124 --> 00:00:51.966]  Internet billionaire Nick Hanauer warns of a coming revolution.
[00:00:52.026 --> 00:00:52.526]  That's right.
[00:00:52.546 --> 00:00:57.049]  It wasn't just 1776, it's going to be coming again.
[00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.851]  The question is, will it be a peaceful or a violent revolution?
[00:01:01.431 --> 00:01:07.637]  Will it be a revolution that results in more individual freedom or an authoritarian police state?
[00:01:08.138 --> 00:01:09.660]  Now, he had some interesting things to say.
[00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.881]  We're going to talk about that.
[00:01:11.481 --> 00:01:16.827]  He says that if they don't fix some of the problems, the pitchforks are going to come out.
[00:01:17.267 --> 00:01:17.828]  They certainly are.
[00:01:17.848 --> 00:01:21.231]  I don't necessarily agree with his solution, but we're going to talk about that.
[00:01:21.852 --> 00:01:28.174]  And of course we're going to also have in this edition today, we're going to be talking to author Peter Van Buren.
[00:01:28.214 --> 00:01:33.836]  Now he's not only an author of a couple of books, he was somebody who worked at the State Department for a couple of decades.
[00:01:34.396 --> 00:01:40.678]  And so we want to talk to him about his book, which is The Ghost of Tom Jode, The Story of the 99%.
[00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:45.220]  You may remember that name, Tom Jode?
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.081]  That's the main character from The Grapes of Wrath.
[00:01:48.161 --> 00:01:51.882]  If you remember the movie, that was the character that was played by Henry Fonda.
[00:01:52.902 --> 00:01:57.304]  And so he kind of brings that into a more contemporary setting.
[00:01:58.044 --> 00:02:06.707]  Instead of it being set in the Depression, it's set in Middle America, going into the, from the 1950s to the current day.
[00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:12.969]  Instead of the Dust Bowl, we've got the Rust Belt that he's talking about.
[00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:29.901]  That's going to be an interesting interview because he spent a lot of time in Iraq and it was just Sunday that the New York Times, specifically James Risen, started talking about how Blackwater guards in the embassy there in Iraq were essentially doing whatever they wished.
[00:02:30.501 --> 00:02:33.665]  And even threatening State Department investigators.
[00:02:33.825 --> 00:02:34.646]  Threatening to kill them.
[00:02:34.907 --> 00:02:43.638]  Saying, this is Iraq, I can kill you if I want to and no one could or would do anything about it.
[00:02:44.038 --> 00:02:45.220]  We're in Iraq.
[00:02:45.821 --> 00:02:47.863]  That was what the Blackwater...
[00:02:48.868 --> 00:03:00.139]  People there told the State Department investigators and shortly after that we had that massacre of 17 civilians including a nine-year-old boy in a public square.
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.866]  They're now being investigated for murder but I want to talk to him about what happened and what
[00:03:08.234 --> 00:03:09.815]  What he saw there in Iraq.
[00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:11.176]  So that's going to be a very interesting interview.
[00:03:11.216 --> 00:03:13.858]  We got Paul Joseph Watson joining us at the bottom of this hour.
[00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.982]  He's going to be talking about the new revelation from the mainstream media.
[00:03:19.042 --> 00:03:24.386]  We've been telling you about it for a long time, but I guess you can believe it now because Charlie Rose says so.
[00:03:25.327 --> 00:03:28.948]  It's kind of like the old Get Smart series, you know, where he says, uh, would you believe?
[00:03:28.968 --> 00:03:30.888]  Uh, it's not that we're lying.
[00:03:30.928 --> 00:03:32.369]  That's what he was doing when he was doing it.
[00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:39.991]  It's that, uh, people won't believe us unless it's coming from CBS or PBS or NBC or some other mainstream media.
[00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:45.592]  Well, now they're openly talking about how they're using LED lights to monitor people.
[00:03:46.272 --> 00:03:50.036]  Yeah, it's no longer a tinfoil hat issue, and it never was.
[00:03:50.136 --> 00:03:55.382]  We knew the technology was there just as we knew that people were looking at you through your laptops.
[00:03:55.842 --> 00:04:00.187]  People laughed at Alex Jones for a long time about saying that they were spying on us.
[00:04:00.788 --> 00:04:04.572]  Now it's common knowledge, and many people are just pushing back and saying, so what?
[00:04:05.012 --> 00:04:07.893]  We're going to talk about the implications of that with Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:04:07.913 --> 00:04:08.674]  He has a story up.
[00:04:09.194 --> 00:04:14.336]  He also has a story up about how people get used to living in slavery.
[00:04:14.396 --> 00:04:16.077]  That's an amazing story.
[00:04:16.137 --> 00:04:18.558]  So we're going to go over that article from Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:04:19.018 --> 00:04:19.838]  We have another story here.
[00:04:19.898 --> 00:04:24.580]  Police arrest a paraplegic man for considering himself to be a pedestrian.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.421]  And it's not just that they arrested him.
[00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:28.802]  They threw him out of his wheelchair.
[00:04:29.662 --> 00:04:33.464]  Face on the ground when he refused to stand up.
[00:04:34.064 --> 00:04:39.966]  See, the problem is he's in a wheelchair, as he explained to them, because he is paralyzed from the chest down.
[00:04:40.727 --> 00:04:42.867]  And so that's what we see happening here.
[00:04:42.887 --> 00:04:46.969]  We've also got some updates on this Tea Party defeat in Mississippi.
[00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:54.172]  We now have a Mississippi Democrat Party officials who are admitting that the Cochran team wanted help in stealing the elections
[00:04:54.232 --> 00:04:54.673]  Stay with us.
[00:04:54.693 --> 00:04:55.515]  We're going to be right back.
[00:04:55.535 --> 00:04:59.244]  We're going to have reports from Alex Jones on Agenda 21 as well.
[00:04:59.305 --> 00:05:00.006]  So stay with us.
[00:05:00.026 --> 00:05:01.189]  It's going to be an exciting program.
[00:05:10.521 --> 00:05:15.265]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[00:05:15.485 --> 00:05:18.587]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[00:05:18.828 --> 00:05:20.689]  She's just not the woman I married.
[00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:22.871]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[00:05:23.091 --> 00:05:24.572]  Does this seem familiar?
[00:05:24.752 --> 00:05:27.794]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[00:05:28.075 --> 00:05:29.416]  If so, consider this.
[00:05:29.656 --> 00:05:38.583]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[00:05:38.943 --> 00:05:44.946]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.
[00:05:45.326 --> 00:05:46.946]  Forget synthetic chemicals.
[00:05:47.367 --> 00:05:55.010]  Super Female Vitality brings forward key herbs specifically chosen for women's biology without the use of phony additives.

[00:06:04.061 --> 00:06:04.782]  Live Life Healthy!
[00:06:10.342 --> 00:06:17.426]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:06:17.506 --> 00:06:19.668]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:06:19.848 --> 00:06:24.971]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:30.174]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:06:30.314 --> 00:06:33.336]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:06:33.616 --> 00:06:37.478]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:06:37.698 --> 00:06:41.940]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:52.045]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:54.766]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:06:54.966 --> 00:07:03.019]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[00:07:11.249 --> 00:07:12.310]  In the near future.
[00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.753]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[00:07:17.093 --> 00:07:18.114]  Security alert.
[00:07:18.314 --> 00:07:20.055]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:20.936]  Analysis.
[00:07:21.196 --> 00:07:21.856]  InfoWars.
[00:07:21.917 --> 00:07:23.878]  Building independent media operations.
[00:07:23.898 --> 00:07:28.881]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:07:28.901 --> 00:07:29.842]  Crime Directive.
[00:07:29.942 --> 00:07:31.363]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:07:31.483 --> 00:07:34.265]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:07:34.345 --> 00:07:37.407]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:07:37.587 --> 00:07:39.749]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:41.370]  These people are assaulting us!
[00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.513]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:07:43.553 --> 00:07:45.895]  They are never going to stop.
[00:07:46.176 --> 00:07:50.080]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.424]  Block free iPhone ads at InfoWars.com.
[00:07:53.824 --> 00:07:56.487]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[00:07:57.188 --> 00:07:57.928]  Imperative.
[00:07:58.169 --> 00:08:00.071]  Destroy 4-Minute TV.
[00:08:00.131 --> 00:08:02.013]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy!
[00:08:02.293 --> 00:08:04.675]  Not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:08:04.856 --> 00:08:06.257]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[00:08:06.277 --> 00:08:18.309]  You can feel it.
[00:08:19.069 --> 00:08:24.054]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:08:24.074 --> 00:08:25.576]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:28.621 --> 00:08:33.082]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, your host on this July 1st, 2014.
[00:08:33.622 --> 00:08:43.665]  Now, tomorrow is July the 2nd, and you know, one of the ways that you might want to celebrate the 4th of July weekend is go check out a new movie from Dinesh D'Souza.
[00:08:44.486 --> 00:08:55.369]  He's been a guest on the Alex Jones Show, talking about this movie, talking about how he's being persecuted by the Obama administration, because you know, they do come after anyone who they don't like.
[00:08:56.257 --> 00:08:58.418]  Think about the Espionage Act of 1917.
[00:09:00.258 --> 00:09:06.180]  For 92 years, it was used three times, from Presidents Woodrow Wilson all the way up to Obama.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.662]  Then within five years, he's used it six times, mostly against journalists.
[00:09:12.222 --> 00:09:29.545]  I was just talking before the break about that story that was broken by the New York Times Sunday by James Risen talking about how Blackwater felt that they were free to threaten any State Department investigators, said, I can kill you and there's nothing that anyone could or would do about it because this is Iraq.
[00:09:30.586 --> 00:09:32.668]  This is the attitude of Blackwater.
[00:09:33.188 --> 00:09:36.691]  And that was just a couple of weeks before the massacre of 17 civilians.
[00:09:37.071 --> 00:09:43.276]  We're going to be talking to Peter Van Buren, a State Department official who worked for them for a couple of decades.
[00:09:43.517 --> 00:09:46.699]  And he was there shortly before that time.
[00:09:46.739 --> 00:09:50.122]  So I want to get his feeling on what's going on in Iraq right now.
[00:09:50.162 --> 00:09:55.727]  What was it like to be in that kind of a work environment there at the embassy in Baghdad?
[00:09:56.167 --> 00:10:02.998]  And of course, when he started writing about the failed policies of the State Department, they attacked him, just like they did Dinesh D'Souza.
[00:10:04.056 --> 00:10:09.878]  They came after him initially because he linked to something that was put up at WikiLeaks.
[00:10:10.158 --> 00:10:13.459]  He didn't leak information, he linked to it.
[00:10:14.219 --> 00:10:21.141]  And many people believe that that was a trial balloon for what they would later do to journalist Barrett Browning.
[00:10:21.581 --> 00:10:24.642]  So, this is an important trend that we see.
[00:10:24.662 --> 00:10:26.582]  Of course, they're coming after Dinesh D'Souza.
[00:10:26.742 --> 00:10:32.204]  They will find anything that they can come after somebody about, whether it's using the IRS or the FEC.
[00:10:33.664 --> 00:10:38.247]  Or whether or not they're going to claim that it's national security coming after someone.
[00:10:38.287 --> 00:10:40.948]  But Dinesh D'Souza's movie is coming out tomorrow.
[00:10:41.408 --> 00:10:51.153]  And there's an article by Jerome Corsi, another frequent guest here of Alex's on the radio show, saying that the left is coming out screaming against his movie before it comes out.
[00:10:51.233 --> 00:10:57.976]  They want to give it a lot of attention because his previous movie was the second most popular political documentary of all time, earning
[00:10:58.476 --> 00:10:59.096]  We're good to go.
[00:11:13.649 --> 00:11:15.070]  This is what one of the guys said.
[00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:17.832]  This guy's name is Romero.
[00:11:17.892 --> 00:11:21.454]  He writes for the Daily Beast.
[00:11:22.275 --> 00:11:26.538]  And he said, D'Souza is a conservative provocateur.
[00:11:27.178 --> 00:11:39.286]  And Romero said that he lacked the space to dispute every specious point that D'Souza makes in America, or to highlight every bit of nonsensical sophistry he employs in order to mask the emptiness of his so-called reasoning.
[00:11:39.326 --> 00:11:40.827]  Well, there you go.
[00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:43.009]  He says he's just throwing factoids against the wall.
[00:11:43.749 --> 00:11:46.994]  But he doesn't have the time to address those factoids.
[00:11:47.514 --> 00:11:51.900]  He just doesn't have the space to refute it, so he just calls him names.
[00:11:53.643 --> 00:11:58.089]  Just says, his arguments are just specious and I don't have room to refute them.
[00:11:58.469 --> 00:11:59.931]  He doesn't even try to address them.
[00:12:00.532 --> 00:12:03.596]  He calls them factoids instead of facts.
[00:12:04.096 --> 00:12:05.918]  It's the language that they use.
[00:12:06.299 --> 00:12:08.601]  They always come at you with the language.
[00:12:09.182 --> 00:12:11.745]  I thought there was an interesting link on Drudge today.
[00:12:11.965 --> 00:12:13.387]  The language of despotism.
[00:12:13.427 --> 00:12:14.808]  This came out of the Hoover Institute.
[00:12:15.749 --> 00:12:19.452]  And one of the things this article says, they go back, they say it's not just Orwell.
[00:12:20.293 --> 00:12:31.761]  In 1984 they said there was a Greek writer who said that words have to change their ordinary meaning and to take that which was now given them in order to control people.
[00:12:31.882 --> 00:12:39.547]  Orwell went on to say politics in the English language, he said, political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible.
[00:12:39.908 --> 00:12:41.689]  And they give a couple of examples in this article.
[00:12:41.729 --> 00:12:44.812]  They talk about how we've had the term affirmative action.
[00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:49.575]  That's been replaced with race-sensitive admissions.
[00:12:50.336 --> 00:13:01.125]  And he says, but affirmative action was itself a euphemism for racial quotas and the use of college admissions until they were struck down by the Supreme Court case in 1978, Bakke.
[00:13:01.805 --> 00:13:09.292]  To salvage racial discrimination, which any process gives race an advantage necessarily requires, Bakke legitimized yet another euphemism.
[00:13:09.952 --> 00:13:10.533]  Diversity!
[00:13:11.194 --> 00:13:17.362]  After a compelling state interest that had justified taking race into account in the university admissions.
[00:13:17.462 --> 00:13:21.628]  So they use those terms and we... Now, here's a question for you.
[00:13:22.837 --> 00:13:24.538]  One more example he's got here before I get to that.
[00:13:26.259 --> 00:13:35.263]  In 2009, of course, there were 13 people killed at Fort Hood by a Muslim army major, and that's still classified as, quote, workplace violence.
[00:13:35.943 --> 00:13:36.643]  Workplace violence.
[00:13:36.964 --> 00:13:38.604]  Now, here's a pop quiz.
[00:13:39.385 --> 00:13:43.767]  What other term do you hear in the news every day that is propaganda?
[00:13:45.368 --> 00:13:45.788]  Time's up.
[00:13:46.848 --> 00:13:47.889]  Undocumented immigrants.
[00:13:48.877 --> 00:13:49.777]  Undocumented immigrants.
[00:13:49.797 --> 00:13:54.219]  See, the illegal aliens are not illegal, and they're not from another country.
[00:13:54.579 --> 00:13:55.639]  They're immigrants.
[00:13:55.719 --> 00:13:58.860]  They're now living here, and they just don't have their documentation yet.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.202]  But of course, the city of New York and other places are going to offer them
[00:14:04.002 --> 00:14:08.366]  Five million dollars to defend them, to provide documentation for them.
[00:14:08.506 --> 00:14:11.429]  Everything from library cards to every other form of ID.
[00:14:11.449 --> 00:14:23.660]  And I'm sure they'll find a way to get them in as voters, because this is one of the things that this collapse of the border is about, is a massive gerrymandering on steroids.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.144]  Because, you know, always with gerrymandering, they've made a fine art of going into
[00:14:28.784 --> 00:14:30.065]  We're good to go.
[00:14:49.784 --> 00:14:58.286]  Now, instead of using computers to pick which voters you want in which districts, they're just going to import the voters into the areas that they want.
[00:14:58.326 --> 00:15:02.307]  You know, bring them into California, bring them into New York.
[00:15:03.047 --> 00:15:07.528]  And we've got a clip from one of the places in California.
[00:15:07.548 --> 00:15:08.629]  Guys, can you cue this up?
[00:15:08.789 --> 00:15:16.891]  We have a mayor in California and he's talking about how the immigrants are going to be brought in
[00:15:18.214 --> 00:15:22.956]  About 140 every 72 hours from Texas.
[00:15:24.176 --> 00:15:27.998]  And the people are not very happy about it at this town meeting.
[00:15:28.018 --> 00:15:30.839]  Can you guys play that?
[00:15:30.879 --> 00:15:33.900]  We've been told that most of these immigrants are families.
[00:15:34.221 --> 00:15:38.022]  These are mothers and young children, or fathers and young children.
[00:15:38.182 --> 00:15:45.545]  The mayor tried to reassure constituents their safety is not in jeopardy, but his words did little to soothe a heated crowd.
[00:15:45.565 --> 00:15:46.846]  I'd like to know, sir,
[00:15:47.606 --> 00:15:54.892]  Do we have a plan, and I'd like to know what that plan is, in the event that these people are starting to be dealt all over town.
[00:15:54.912 --> 00:15:59.596]  I'm sorry, I don't feel our officials, and I apologize to everybody, are being really honest.
[00:16:00.076 --> 00:16:05.641]  Federal immigration officials say the immigrants processed in Murrieta are unlikely to stay in the area.
[00:16:05.961 --> 00:16:15.829]  What will happen is once they're processed by the Border Patrol, they'll be released to ICE agents who will make sure they get to their destination and or transportation hubs.
[00:16:16.149 --> 00:16:20.916]  Murrieta's mayor says this first group of 140 people may be the tip of the iceberg.
[00:16:21.217 --> 00:16:29.869]  He says it's possible that every 72 hours another group of about 140 undocumented immigrants will be coming here for processing at this facility.
[00:16:30.543 --> 00:16:31.023]  That's right.
[00:16:31.063 --> 00:16:33.465]  They don't feel like they're being told the truth.
[00:16:33.525 --> 00:16:34.506]  Well, guess what?
[00:16:34.606 --> 00:16:35.126]  Neither do we.
[00:16:35.606 --> 00:16:38.949]  We have a story up on InfoWars from Don Salazar.
[00:16:38.969 --> 00:16:40.290]  It's been picked up by the Drudge Report.
[00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:44.553]  Two more swine flu cases confirmed among minor detainees.
[00:16:45.273 --> 00:16:47.294]  And this is something that broke over the weekend.
[00:16:47.334 --> 00:16:53.599]  We had two additional cases of swine flu virus were confirmed amongst the Central American illegal immigrant minors.
[00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:58.401]  This is information that came to us from the president of the local Border Patrol Union.
[00:16:58.441 --> 00:17:04.124]  He said both cases involving juveniles were confirmed on Friday by medical personnel located at the facility.
[00:17:04.524 --> 00:17:11.147]  He also said about 120 people have been isolated due to exposure with the afflicted juveniles.
[00:17:11.227 --> 00:17:21.832]  And then on Sunday, he said two more children at the Border Patrol station in Brownsville were also isolated, although they have not confirmed that those are H1N1 swine flu viruses yet.
[00:17:22.492 --> 00:17:23.373]  This is his comment.
[00:17:23.433 --> 00:17:29.901]  This is what the guy who is talking to us at the National Border Patrol Council said.
[00:17:30.061 --> 00:17:36.289]  It is contagious and we're transporting people to different parts of the state and to different parts of the country.
[00:17:36.329 --> 00:17:38.051]  And you hear people in California say
[00:17:38.932 --> 00:17:39.713]  What's going on?
[00:17:39.913 --> 00:17:50.058]  They're sending 140 people about every 72 hours, you heard the mayor say, and then ICE is going to transport them farther into the country, and that was his point.
[00:17:50.098 --> 00:17:55.641]  He said, these minors are being kept in overcrowded facilities, ridden with poor hygiene.
[00:17:55.801 --> 00:17:59.203]  This is the ideal condition for a viral outbreak.
[00:17:59.723 --> 00:18:00.584]  That was just yesterday.
[00:18:00.644 --> 00:18:06.007]  I talked to Dr. Stanley Monteith on the show, and he was talking about how when HIV was first discovered,
[00:18:06.747 --> 00:18:09.749]  That it was treated not as a contagious disease.
[00:18:09.849 --> 00:18:12.531]  People were not told how to avoid exposure to it.
[00:18:12.611 --> 00:18:13.472]  We didn't do anything.
[00:18:13.532 --> 00:18:18.415]  The CDC would not do anything to stop exposure to it or to help people to stop exposure to it.
[00:18:18.675 --> 00:18:20.616]  No, it was treated as a political issue.
[00:18:21.397 --> 00:18:31.424]  And so now we have not just HIV because it was also, they said, there's increasing worries about immigrants hailing from Honduras that could be affected with HIV.
[00:18:31.724 --> 00:18:32.565]  It's not just HIV.
[00:18:33.405 --> 00:18:43.049]  It's a whole slew of diseases that have been identified, but of course, as we also reported, the CDC has no interest in this.
[00:18:43.129 --> 00:18:48.752]  These border officials, the Border Patrol Union has contacted the CDC, asked them for help.
[00:18:48.812 --> 00:18:50.672]  They said, it's not our job.
[00:18:51.093 --> 00:18:51.873]  It's not their job.
[00:18:53.188 --> 00:18:59.731]  Now, one of the things behind this, of course, is we would like to get people to understand is that this is about making NAFTA a fact.
[00:18:59.871 --> 00:19:03.632]  As Petraeus said, this is something that was passed 20 years ago.
[00:19:03.672 --> 00:19:04.513]  They passed NAFTA.
[00:19:04.893 --> 00:19:05.993]  The laws have been on the books.
[00:19:06.253 --> 00:19:08.754]  Now they're making it an established fact.
[00:19:08.854 --> 00:19:10.215]  It was the law du jour.
[00:19:10.255 --> 00:19:12.316]  Now it's becoming de facto.
[00:19:12.356 --> 00:19:13.756]  They're making it an accomplished fact.
[00:19:13.776 --> 00:19:16.898]  And one of the things that he said in that speech, where he said, what comes after America?
[00:19:16.918 --> 00:19:17.478]  Well, that's simple.
[00:19:18.098 --> 00:19:19.059]  North America.
[00:19:19.099 --> 00:19:22.382]  He means North American Union and he made it very clear that was what he meant.
[00:19:23.282 --> 00:19:33.391]  He was talking about how the demographics in all these other countries are falling and Europe even in China and other places in Asia and yet in North America they're increasing.
[00:19:34.189 --> 00:19:34.789]  It's like, really?
[00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.230]  Really?
[00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:36.110]  Are they really increasing?
[00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:36.410]  U.S.
[00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:43.675]  News and World Report says today that America's evolving look since this shows that white deaths are outpacing births.
[00:19:44.415 --> 00:19:44.755]  Okay?
[00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:45.836]  It's not happening.
[00:19:46.116 --> 00:19:49.078]  They're bringing people in for that demographic increase.
[00:19:49.418 --> 00:19:53.841]  And yet in the same speech, he talks about how they're going to have to get along with fewer people working.
[00:19:53.881 --> 00:19:55.922]  They're not looking at that for the long term.
[00:19:55.942 --> 00:19:57.663]  They're not bringing them in for workers.
[00:19:58.163 --> 00:20:09.285]  Stay with us, we're going to have Paul Joseph Watson at the bottom of the hour, Alex Jones is going to have a special report on Agenda 21, and Peter Van Buren, a diplomat who's been in Iraq at Baghdad, gives us the scoop.
[00:20:10.806 --> 00:20:14.747]  Hey folks, this is Larry Crisp for babyboomerbackupplan.com.
[00:20:14.947 --> 00:20:18.107]  I don't have to tell you, this economy sucks.
[00:20:18.647 --> 00:20:25.749]  Unlike the political elite and Wall Street bankers, you know that debts don't disappear and bailouts have big consequences.
[00:20:26.169 --> 00:20:32.613]  Stock and real estate market bubbles can pop at any moment and evaporate most or all of your retirement savings.
[00:20:32.973 --> 00:20:37.156]  Folks, we're in the weakest economy of our lifetime and it's likely to get much worse.
[00:20:37.476 --> 00:20:43.360]  Virtually zero sectors of the economy are hiring and workforce participation is at record lows.
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:50.665]  And I'm here to tell you, this may be the best thing that could happen to you if you move decidedly and develop a backup plan immediately.
[00:20:50.825 --> 00:20:56.490]  Proportionately more millionaires were created during the Great Depression than at any time in history.
[00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:58.531]  And history is about to repeat itself.

[00:21:10.967 --> 00:21:12.728]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grew.
[00:21:13.249 --> 00:21:20.233]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[00:21:20.693 --> 00:21:31.120]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[00:21:31.501 --> 00:21:40.747]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[00:21:41.467 --> 00:21:44.910]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[00:21:45.531 --> 00:21:48.974]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[00:21:49.314 --> 00:21:50.855]  Experience the new formula.
[00:21:51.356 --> 00:21:53.338]  Experience the ancient purity.
[00:21:53.938 --> 00:21:54.879]  Shield your family.
[00:21:55.279 --> 00:21:56.660]  Survival Shield X2.

[00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:13.256]  It's been said, those who control the food, control the people.
[00:22:13.476 --> 00:22:17.222]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[00:22:17.302 --> 00:22:23.231]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[00:22:23.512 --> 00:22:24.874]  Genetically modified crops.
[00:22:24.994 --> 00:22:33.580]  Processed foods and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system, which accounts for 80% of your immune system.
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:38.143]  Take back control of your health with Pro-EM1 Probiotic from Terragenics.
[00:22:38.363 --> 00:22:46.348]  Pro-EM1 Probiotic helps protect your body against irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, diabetes,
[00:22:46.508 --> 00:22:48.369]  The common cold and much more.
[00:22:48.509 --> 00:23:00.034]  And including a powerful probiotic like Pro-EM-1 as part of your daily routine puts you back in control and prevents you from becoming a mindless zombie manipulated by the pharmaceutical and GMO agendas.
[00:23:00.214 --> 00:23:03.135]  Call Terragenics at 866-369-3678 or visit Terragenics.com.

[00:23:09.478 --> 00:23:10.919]  A sudden change in the wind.
[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:17.464]  The day grows dark as ominous clouds move in and lightning begins to carve arcs in the sky.
[00:23:17.884 --> 00:23:20.606]  And you realize you are not prepared.
[00:23:22.288 --> 00:23:26.050]  The number of intense storms is increasing exponentially in the U.S.
[00:23:26.331 --> 00:23:32.175]  Tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding and droughts are happening with greater magnitude and frequency.
[00:23:32.415 --> 00:23:35.077]  If you are choosing to rely on the government to save you,
[00:23:35.117 --> 00:23:36.558]  And no one's coming to help them.
[00:23:36.738 --> 00:23:38.079]  You could be dead wrong.
[00:23:38.319 --> 00:23:43.422]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster is a visit to mypatriotsupply.com.
[00:23:43.502 --> 00:23:50.486]  There, you'll find the absolute best prices on storable foods, non-GMO seeds, emergency water filtration devices, and so much more.
[00:23:50.506 --> 00:23:50.886]  I don't know.
[00:24:23.226 --> 00:24:24.527]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:24.567 --> 00:24:25.687]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[00:24:25.727 --> 00:24:29.049]  I'm going to be joined in the next segment, Paul Joseph Watson, out of the UK.
[00:24:29.069 --> 00:24:32.772]  We're going to talk about some breaking articles on Infowars.com.
[00:24:33.512 --> 00:24:51.062]  One of them, we've now learned from Charlie Rose, who of course we can now trust him, even though Alex has been telling you this for a very long time, that your LED lights can be used to track you, to spy on you, even to determine if you've got firearms.
[00:24:51.302 --> 00:24:51.863]  How about that?
[00:24:53.214 --> 00:24:57.677]  No paranoia there because that's Charlie Rose and we can believe anything he has to say.
[00:24:58.278 --> 00:25:09.625]  Also, an amazing article about a guy who lived in a prison and lived as a slave in North Korea and how he can't get his head around being free.
[00:25:10.185 --> 00:25:11.825]  They kind of liked his slavery.
[00:25:11.845 --> 00:25:14.606]  So we're going to be talking about that with Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:25:14.746 --> 00:25:19.808]  Alex Jones also has a special report coming up in the second hour on Agenda 21.
[00:25:19.868 --> 00:25:21.748]  You won't want to miss that special report.
[00:25:22.348 --> 00:25:27.190]  And we're going to be talking to Peter Van Buren, somebody who for 23 years worked for the State Department.
[00:25:28.157 --> 00:25:48.737]  He was talking after he left the State Department about how ineffective things were in Iraq, so we want to talk to him and get his take as someone who's been there, who's been fairly high up in the State Department, get his take on what is going on now in Iraq, and also what we just learned on Sunday about how Blackwater was threatening
[00:25:48.797 --> 00:25:49.557]  We're good to go.
[00:26:11.323 --> 00:26:23.292]  About the Hobby Lobby, about the mandate, and it was a clash of, can the government force us to violate our religious convictions?
[00:26:24.013 --> 00:26:32.960]  And of course the left was saying, well, this is a corporation because this family business decided to incorporate, now they no longer have any religious freedom.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.281]  The Supreme Court said
[00:26:35.163 --> 00:26:36.363]  No, actually, they do.
[00:26:36.544 --> 00:26:38.764]  And the Supreme Court, I believe, made the right decision.
[00:26:38.784 --> 00:26:45.867]  Now, of course, we had in the dissent, we had some female justices were very angry about this.
[00:26:45.967 --> 00:26:56.851]  The Justice Ginsburg said, well, we're going to have a situation now where just anyone, any corporation or anyone can assert they have religious objections.
[00:26:56.871 --> 00:26:57.951]  It's like, yeah.
[00:26:58.823 --> 00:27:01.445]  Yeah, that's what the First Amendment is about.
[00:27:02.126 --> 00:27:04.748]  She thought that was just too radical of an idea.
[00:27:04.788 --> 00:27:06.169]  She actually used that word.
[00:27:06.209 --> 00:27:07.270]  She said it was too radical.
[00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:13.455]  We saw that Supreme Court Justice Kagan said that, you can't do this.
[00:27:14.236 --> 00:27:16.618]  Congress gave an entitlement.
[00:27:17.158 --> 00:27:18.079]  They made a law.
[00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:26.315]  Well, the First Amendment says Congress shall make no law abridging the free exercise of religion.
[00:27:26.715 --> 00:27:28.616]  The exercise of religion.
[00:27:28.737 --> 00:27:33.420]  These are not just convictions that we hold quietly in the closet.
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:45.088]  And of course, there's been a lot of reactions to this, and a lot of hate calling for Hobby Lobby to be boycotted, many people calling for violence, calling for it to be burned down, and of course,
[00:27:45.888 --> 00:27:48.552]  Doesn't look like the government's worried about that.
[00:27:48.672 --> 00:27:57.626]  They would be all over it if somebody was talking about burning down the White House, but you can talk about burning down people's private property and their businesses and evidently that's not a problem.
[00:27:58.683 --> 00:27:59.803]  This, I thought, was interesting.
[00:27:59.823 --> 00:28:11.046]  And along the same line, we see that in Canada, a small town, City Council, has cancelled an event at a city-owned facility last month after learning that the event was going to be sponsored in part by Chick-fil-A.
[00:28:11.566 --> 00:28:13.647]  This is a town of about 85,000 people.
[00:28:14.187 --> 00:28:23.629]  It was going to be an event that was going to be leased out to a Georgia-based leadership organization there in Nanaimo, British Columbia, I believe is the way it's pronounced.
[00:28:24.329 --> 00:28:26.811]  And this is what the city council person said.
[00:28:26.871 --> 00:28:37.197]  He said, um, any events that are associated with organizations or people that promote or have a history of divisiveness, homophobia, or expressions of hate.
[00:28:37.897 --> 00:28:38.197]  Hate?
[00:28:38.618 --> 00:28:40.199]  I didn't know that Chick-fil-A was about hate.
[00:28:41.079 --> 00:28:42.460]  Will not be permitted by the city.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.803]  And then he went on to say, to compare them to organized crime.
[00:28:45.863 --> 00:28:51.727]  He said, I think that Chick-fil-A's beliefs are almost to a criminal point of view this day and age.
[00:28:51.767 --> 00:28:56.291]  Yes, they nearly have criminalized any dissent with the state religion.
[00:28:56.631 --> 00:29:07.058]  And when he compares it to organized crime, we need to realize that if we don't stand for due process for even the worst people, even somebody you don't like, then you're going to lose it for yourself.
[00:29:07.935 --> 00:29:17.162]  The RICO statutes were initially created because they couldn't get convictions against organized crime and it wasn't too long before they were using it against abortion protesters.
[00:29:18.283 --> 00:29:25.228]  This is the kind of slippery slope we see and now it's gotten to the point where they feel like they can go in and confiscate the assets of people.
[00:29:25.268 --> 00:29:32.133]  We just had a case where a couple who was accused of stealing medical devices took out a loan on their home.
[00:29:33.394 --> 00:29:38.536]  And the government came in and confiscated their funds from that loan that they'd gotten out to defend themselves.
[00:29:38.576 --> 00:29:46.760]  So now they're left defenseless and they justified it in the same way that they justified attacking organized crime and taking away their due process.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:53.463]  We have to stand for that even for the worst in society or we wind up with this kind of political correctness and tyranny.
[00:29:53.703 --> 00:29:56.084]  We'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[00:29:56.104 --> 00:29:57.405]  Stay with us.
[00:29:59.671 --> 00:30:02.654]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.674 --> 00:30:06.278]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.399 --> 00:30:12.300]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:20.562]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:30:20.662 --> 00:30:27.984]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:30:28.224 --> 00:30:32.505]  I just received my Male Vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[00:30:32.825 --> 00:30:42.990]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:49.634]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:30:49.934 --> 00:30:52.155]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:30:52.175 --> 00:30:56.157]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[00:30:56.317 --> 00:30:57.918]  It's not just the Super Mel Vitality.
[00:30:58.258 --> 00:31:02.201]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.
[00:31:02.422 --> 00:31:09.347]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mel Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[00:31:10.447 --> 00:31:14.449]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:31:14.469 --> 00:31:18.630]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:22.271]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:31:22.512 --> 00:31:25.393]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:31:25.553 --> 00:31:32.915]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:31:33.136 --> 00:31:36.757]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:31:36.977 --> 00:31:41.279]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:31:41.459 --> 00:31:47.381]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:31:47.421 --> 00:31:51.183]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:31:51.363 --> 00:31:53.884]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:31:54.084 --> 00:31:55.445]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:31:55.605 --> 00:31:56.825]  It's time to take action.
[00:31:56.965 --> 00:31:58.686]  It's time to filter our water.
[00:31:58.826 --> 00:32:05.909]  Visit InfowarsStore.com and use promo code WATER to get 10% off their entire family of incredible products.
[00:32:10.791 --> 00:32:16.753]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:32:16.953 --> 00:32:21.155]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:32:21.515 --> 00:32:26.077]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:32:26.497 --> 00:32:29.119]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:32:29.419 --> 00:32:34.622]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:32:34.863 --> 00:32:41.747]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:32:42.247 --> 00:32:46.030]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:51.173]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:51.513 --> 00:32:52.354]  This is innovating.
[00:32:52.634 --> 00:32:59.924]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:33:00.124 --> 00:33:04.169]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:09.556]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off Super Detox Special at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:33:20.868 --> 00:33:25.010]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:27.212]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:29.153 --> 00:33:30.534]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:30.654 --> 00:33:35.917]  I'm David Knight here in Austin and from the UK we're being joined now with Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:33:35.937 --> 00:33:39.819]  We're going to talk about a couple of articles that he's got up on InfoWars.com.
[00:33:40.479 --> 00:33:43.841]  Smart streetlights to track everything we do all the time?
[00:33:44.361 --> 00:33:47.003]  You can believe that because now CBS News is reporting it.
[00:33:47.623 --> 00:33:51.326]  And also, can a slave ever truly understand freedom?
[00:33:51.386 --> 00:33:55.789]  A man who escaped from a North Korean death camp now wants to return.
[00:33:55.809 --> 00:33:58.190]  So we're going to talk to Paul Joseph Watson about that.
[00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:05.995]  Before we do, I want to let you know that this hour of the Alex Jones Radio Show is brought to you by some of the products that we offer here.
[00:34:06.035 --> 00:34:08.417]  And of course, that's the way we fund our operation.
[00:34:08.917 --> 00:34:10.979]  We're not funded by grants from the government.
[00:34:11.039 --> 00:34:16.923]  We're not funded by big pharmaceutical companies, as most of the networks are today.
[00:34:17.703 --> 00:34:19.786]  We're funded by the products that we offer you.
[00:34:20.227 --> 00:34:23.912]  We believe that they're a way to help you and it helps us.
[00:34:24.072 --> 00:34:25.975]  It funds us and it helps your family.
[00:34:26.055 --> 00:34:28.839]  One of those products is a 25% off special right now.
[00:34:28.879 --> 00:34:29.841]  That's Fluoride Shield.
[00:34:30.421 --> 00:34:33.145]  It's an exclusive blend of key herbs and ingredients.
[00:34:33.726 --> 00:34:44.828]  Specifically infused within the formula to help support the elimination of toxic forms of fluoride and other dangerous compounds like mercury, chlorine, and bromine from within the body.
[00:34:44.868 --> 00:34:47.268]  You can find that at Infowarslife.com.
[00:34:47.688 --> 00:34:48.909]  It's 25% off.
[00:34:49.489 --> 00:34:50.449]  Fluoride shield.
[00:34:50.589 --> 00:34:57.450]  Even if you're on a well, you're still going to get exposed to a lot of these chemicals just as you move through society.
[00:34:57.490 --> 00:35:02.531]  If you ever eat out, you're probably exposed in most places to fluoride in your water.
[00:35:03.211 --> 00:35:08.914]  We also have a limited edition of some new Made in 1776 buckles.
[00:35:08.974 --> 00:35:15.437]  And of course, as the 4th of July is coming up, this is a great way to show your support of freedom.
[00:35:15.717 --> 00:35:19.118]  And this particular buckle is about Second Amendment rights.
[00:35:19.158 --> 00:35:20.639]  This is a Molon Lave buckle.
[00:35:20.699 --> 00:35:23.500]  It's the same beautiful design we have on our t-shirts.
[00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:26.822]  It's a limited edition run of only 500 buckles per color.
[00:35:27.782 --> 00:35:36.745]  They have Made in 1776 on the back, as well as a number that tells you which one of these special editions it is.
[00:35:36.805 --> 00:35:39.666]  It's a great conversation starter, and they look super.
[00:35:39.746 --> 00:35:46.929]  So you can find that at InfoWarsStore.com, and you can find the Fluoride Shield 25% off at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:48.590]  Welcome, Paul.
[00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:49.330]  How are you?
[00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:51.591]  David, good to be back.
[00:35:52.261 --> 00:35:53.361]  It's good to have you on here.
[00:35:53.421 --> 00:35:58.543]  You had a interesting article here, and it was very interesting to hear what they had to say.
[00:35:58.583 --> 00:36:08.187]  Of course, Alex has been talking about this, InfoWars has been talking about this for a long time, but now we see that the mainstream media doesn't want to ignore this anymore, do they?
[00:36:09.363 --> 00:36:10.544]  About the LED lights.
[00:36:11.024 --> 00:36:18.690]  Yeah, this is basically a product placement by CBS News talking about these new smart LED lights which are being rolled out in major cities across the US.
[00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:22.373]  Las Vegas last year, also New York's rolling them out.
[00:36:23.013 --> 00:36:30.278]  Basically they touted the environmental benefits of saving energy, saving money with these new LED lights.
[00:36:30.378 --> 00:36:34.902]  They kind of gave some token credence to the privacy concerns
[00:36:35.422 --> 00:36:36.843]  While skirting around them.
[00:36:37.203 --> 00:36:51.773]  And basically the CBS anchor says that these new smart streetlights, which as you said we reported years ago through Intellistreet, which is a different company introducing them, will have the ability eventually to track everything we do all the time.
[00:36:51.813 --> 00:37:00.018]  Because what they don't tell you in this CBS News report is the fact that they can record and store actual conversations.
[00:37:00.379 --> 00:37:04.902]  You're walking down the street, the streetlight picks up your conversation, stores it
[00:37:05.482 --> 00:37:07.123]  No doubt, in an NSA database.
[00:37:07.163 --> 00:37:14.887]  That's what they didn't tell you in the CBS report, but it was basically a product placement for these new spying systems masquerading as lies.
[00:37:14.987 --> 00:37:16.727]  Let's play a little bit of that report here.
[00:37:16.787 --> 00:37:21.850]  It's a little bit too long for us to play the entire part of it, but let's play a little bit of that report from CBS This Morning.
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.783]  When you find yourself in Terminal B at Newark Airport, look up!
[00:37:26.123 --> 00:37:28.605]  Those aren't just new lights, they're smart lights.
[00:37:28.945 --> 00:37:35.730]  A sophisticated array of LED fixtures with built-in sensors and cameras connected over a wireless network.
[00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:38.853]  They monitor security, the flow of foot traffic.
[00:37:39.133 --> 00:37:41.955]  Newark's primarily interested in energy savings.
[00:37:42.295 --> 00:37:50.261]  Hugh Martin is president of Sensitivity, a Silicon Valley company that developed the smart lights at Newark and this parking garage in San Jose.
[00:37:50.782 --> 00:37:52.043]  So, these lights
[00:37:54.076 --> 00:37:55.327]  They sense that we're walking?
[00:37:56.147 --> 00:37:59.549]  Yeah, there's a motion sensor in each individual light.
[00:38:00.209 --> 00:38:01.669]  What does this do as far as energy?
[00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:09.873]  This week we saved about $3,500, over $182,000 a year in energy saved just from this.
[00:38:10.533 --> 00:38:17.637]  Across the globe, cities are phasing out old energy-wasting incandescent and sodium bulbs and replacing them with... Okay, that's good.
[00:38:17.657 --> 00:38:20.178]  Yeah, it's not about saving energy.
[00:38:20.258 --> 00:38:25.000]  You can save energy if you've just got an LED bulb, but they're talking about
[00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:37.851]  Watching you about tracking you and they even show in that report They talk about how they're using it for security in a private corporations parking lot And they say this is tracking you everywhere you go and as you just pointed out Paul.
[00:38:38.171 --> 00:38:50.462]  They're recording it So I don't think if you're if you're tracking people you've got all these other devices there, and you're recording stuff That I guess really kind of hurts your energy savings a little bit doesn't it, but it's really not about energy savings
[00:38:51.365 --> 00:38:58.989]  No, I mean in the report they also talk about license plate tracking, so it has very little to do with energy savings and everything to do with surveillance.
[00:38:59.429 --> 00:39:03.170]  And you know we ask commonly what is the ultimate goal of surveillance?
[00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:11.354]  It's not about the surveillance itself, it's about cultivating the fear amongst the general public that everything they do is under ubiquitous surveillance.
[00:39:11.814 --> 00:39:15.336]  So it goes back to what we've talked about before, which is the panopticon effect.
[00:39:15.656 --> 00:39:19.438]  You know, what Foucault talked about in Discipline and Punish, which is that
[00:39:19.978 --> 00:39:24.182]  Those who believe they are being watched will do what is wanted of them.
[00:39:24.562 --> 00:39:25.803]  Obedient compliance.
[00:39:25.944 --> 00:39:29.327]  Without even realizing that they're being controlled.
[00:39:29.367 --> 00:39:31.308]  And that's the whole idea.
[00:39:31.368 --> 00:39:34.391]  It's about creating this compulsion to obedience.
[00:39:34.851 --> 00:39:35.272]  It's about
[00:39:35.592 --> 00:39:48.597]  Institutionalizing the whole idea of, you know, don't stick your neck out, don't talk about politics, don't exercise your freedoms, don't deviate from the received wisdom of the establishment, because Big Brother is always watching.
[00:39:48.637 --> 00:39:51.778]  That's the ultimate goal of surveillance, as we've explained many times.
[00:39:52.298 --> 00:39:55.759]  And the real freedom is to say, I don't care.
[00:39:55.779 --> 00:39:59.361]  I don't care if you're watching me, I'm going to do it anyway.
[00:39:59.381 --> 00:40:02.302]  And that's the attitude that people need to adopt.
[00:40:02.862 --> 00:40:06.203]  They constantly are talking about Orwell in this piece.
[00:40:06.243 --> 00:40:17.587]  They throw it out several times, and I thought it was interesting that at the very end, where this reporter says to the guy that people heard there at the beginning, this is kind of Orwellian, isn't it?
[00:40:17.967 --> 00:40:26.190]  And he comes back and immediately says, well, wouldn't you want to protect your children if this could determine that somebody had a gun on them?
[00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:40.516]  Near a school, so as you're pointing out, they're looking at license plates, they're connecting it to a database, they bragged about how this was going to be a global system, and then at the very end he's talking about scanning to see if somebody's got a gun on them.
[00:40:40.736 --> 00:40:43.397]  And of course, it's all about the children, isn't it Paul?
[00:40:43.437 --> 00:40:48.059]  They always do that, whether it's destroying our borders or destroying our rights, it's all about children.
[00:40:48.119 --> 00:40:49.180]  It's always the beard.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.221]  It sounds rather Orwellian.
[00:40:52.302 --> 00:41:04.614]  At least the parents of kids at a school feel better if they knew that there was a analytic that looked for objects that could be guns on people that were coming into the school.
[00:41:05.095 --> 00:41:05.756]  Yeah, there you go.
[00:41:06.036 --> 00:41:06.897]  Wouldn't that be a good thing?
[00:41:06.997 --> 00:41:07.778]  Wouldn't that be a good thing?
[00:41:09.442 --> 00:41:10.644]  It's always for the kids, isn't it?
[00:41:10.684 --> 00:41:15.828]  Just like, you know, DHS attaching RFID tags to children because they really care about the kids.
[00:41:16.129 --> 00:41:16.349]  Oh yeah.
[00:41:16.389 --> 00:41:21.133]  But it's not about... we know what it's about because we've seen the history, we've seen the pattern, we've seen where it's going.
[00:41:22.114 --> 00:41:25.377]  There have been studies, for example, Stanford University 1975 study,
[00:41:27.279 --> 00:41:38.448]  Which illustrated that participants will side with the establishment position on political arguments like legalizing marijuana if they think their responses are going to be seen by authorities.
[00:41:39.529 --> 00:41:42.532]  There are other studies which show that people, writers,
[00:41:44.293 --> 00:41:52.879]  More reluctant to talk about political subjects, 25% because they fear that it will be picked up in their emails, in their phone conversations with their friends.
[00:41:52.919 --> 00:42:12.992]  So a quarter of Americans at least are subjected to this panopticon effect where you self-censor, you self-regulate not only your free speech but your behavior and the exercise of your freedoms which of course only benefits the establishment, only benefits the state which is one of the major reasons why they're rolling out this huge surveillance network.
[00:42:13.412 --> 00:42:13.853]  That's right.
[00:42:13.933 --> 00:42:16.076]  You have to get over that hump.
[00:42:16.656 --> 00:42:23.884]  You have to get to the point where you say, I'm going to speak out about this anyway, whatever the consequences, and then at that point, you're in.
[00:42:24.445 --> 00:42:29.711]  You're in, and now you're free to say whatever you want to, to criticize this, to speak up for your freedoms.
[00:42:30.552 --> 00:42:38.200]  Talking about that panoptagon effect and people self-censoring themselves and being afraid to say what they are, take it one step further with this other article, Paul.
[00:42:38.661 --> 00:42:40.923]  Can a slave ever truly understand freedom?
[00:42:41.003 --> 00:42:45.348]  This is about the guy who escaped North Korean death camp and now wants to return.
[00:42:46.837 --> 00:42:52.323]  Yeah, this is a documentary I watched a couple of nights ago called Camp 14 Total Control Zone.
[00:42:52.343 --> 00:42:53.724]  I encourage everybody to watch it.
[00:42:54.325 --> 00:42:59.770]  It's basically about a North Korean who was born inside a North Korean death camp.
[00:43:00.291 --> 00:43:02.253]  He witnessed all kinds of horrors.
[00:43:02.293 --> 00:43:03.995]  He was brutally tortured, punished.
[00:43:04.355 --> 00:43:09.180]  He even witnessed the public execution of his mother and his brother because he had
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:14.286]  He had no innate family, you know, he couldn't embrace even the concept of family.
[00:43:14.647 --> 00:43:19.753]  He said that he had no emotion whatsoever when he was watching the execution of his mother and his brother.
[00:43:20.233 --> 00:43:27.602]  So when he risked his life to escape, many years later when he was 23, remember he was born in the camp,
[00:43:28.283 --> 00:43:30.324]  They basically conducted an interview with him.
[00:43:30.364 --> 00:43:31.824]  He defected to South Korea.
[00:43:32.425 --> 00:43:42.248]  And he said that he missed life in the camp and that he wanted to return to this North Korean death camp, this torture camp, because he felt pure.
[00:43:42.308 --> 00:43:44.008]  He had a lack of concern.
[00:43:44.489 --> 00:43:46.509]  He didn't have to worry about free will.
[00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:53.812]  So again, as I point out in the article, it speaks to this idea of, you know, statism in its most undiluted expression.
[00:43:54.312 --> 00:44:07.121]  Which is the ability to induce this potent form of Stockholm Syndrome, where the slave has the need to express free will, or even think about free will, completely eliminated.
[00:44:07.501 --> 00:44:17.668]  So even though he's being tortured every day, he's witnessing all these horrors, he moves to South Korea, relative freedom in comparison, and yet he wants to return to the death camp.
[00:44:18.048 --> 00:44:22.191]  Which is why I asked in the headline, you know, can a slave ever truly understand freedom?
[00:44:22.251 --> 00:44:23.892]  Because if you're born into it, then
[00:44:24.512 --> 00:44:26.214]  What does freedom represent to you?
[00:44:26.274 --> 00:44:39.825]  So I made the comparison, you know, we've got billions of people who are content to remain imprisoned in their own self-imposed jail cells, again going back to the fear of stepping outside their comfort zones in terms of surveillance.
[00:44:40.325 --> 00:44:47.211]  So you can draw a parallel between this North Korean prison inmate who wants to return to the labor camp
[00:44:47.811 --> 00:44:56.578]  And billions of people today who are content to remain in their own self-imprisoned delusion and never, you know, peek outside Pandora's box.
[00:44:56.818 --> 00:45:05.905]  You know, I hear people talk all the time about the trade-off between liberty and security, and the mainstream media and the government want us to believe that there is some kind of a trade-off.
[00:45:07.199 --> 00:45:11.180]  When you trade off your liberty, people without liberty are slaves.
[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:20.023]  And so to the degree that you trade off your human dignity and your human freedom, you become more of a slave by that amount.
[00:45:20.103 --> 00:45:24.244]  And when you trade all of it off, you essentially have all of your security.
[00:45:24.484 --> 00:45:26.544]  You live in a maximum security.
[00:45:26.584 --> 00:45:27.365]  That's a prison.
[00:45:27.645 --> 00:45:28.805]  And so that's what this guy wants.
[00:45:28.845 --> 00:45:30.445]  He really wants his security.
[00:45:30.465 --> 00:45:35.367]  He wants to get back into a maximum security prison in North Korea.
[00:45:36.047 --> 00:45:38.690]  And many people want that today in America.
[00:45:38.931 --> 00:45:46.520]  I used to, I said this yesterday, I used to hear all the time people say, as just kind of a joke, a figure of speech, hey, it's a free country, and you know, they say, hey, can I do this?
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:47.802]  It's a free country, do whatever you want.
[00:45:47.822 --> 00:45:49.384]  You don't hear people say that anymore.
[00:45:49.424 --> 00:45:53.229]  People don't think of America as being a free country, and it isn't a free country.
[00:45:53.769 --> 00:45:56.771]  Because one of the other things you used to hear all the time was, hey, there ought to be a law.
[00:45:57.132 --> 00:45:58.893]  Or, you know, you're making a federal case out of it.
[00:45:58.933 --> 00:46:02.536]  They've made a federal case out of everything, and they made a law essentially about everything.
[00:46:02.576 --> 00:46:07.559]  But the other thing, Paul, that I think this brings out is the danger.
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:10.602]  You said that he had absolutely no concept of family.
[00:46:11.062 --> 00:46:14.805]  He didn't react to the fact that he saw members of his family executed.
[00:46:15.465 --> 00:46:18.268]  That has been the dream of tyrants forever.
[00:46:19.076 --> 00:46:20.817]  It was formalized in Plato's Republic.
[00:46:20.857 --> 00:46:30.622]  They wanted to make sure that people didn't know who their parents were, so that their only family, the only thing that they had any connection to, was the state, no matter how badly it treated them.
[00:46:31.022 --> 00:46:32.283]  And that's what this guy has.
[00:46:32.323 --> 00:46:34.804]  He's evidence of how well that works.
[00:46:34.884 --> 00:46:39.866]  And I feel like that's the danger when we see this massive influx of young people.
[00:46:39.926 --> 00:46:46.710]  And of course, part of that is a beard, to say that it's all about the youth coming across the border, because Obama does
[00:46:47.310 --> 00:47:17.030]  Classify children as people up to the age of 31 in his documents there, but you know that is a danger when we see there are massive number of children that are coming in and I think that that connection that they have losing that connection to their family to that degree coming into a different culture where we can't reach them to get them to understand the American traditions of Liberty because of language barrier as easily or as soon I think that's a very dangerous part of this explosion of immigration at the border.
[00:47:18.611 --> 00:47:34.005]  Exactly, and I mean also tying into this in terms of enslavement and surveillance is the Facebook issue, which if the audience didn't hear about this, Facebook basically conducted a secret experiment back in 2012 with 700 users.
[00:47:34.445 --> 00:47:41.191]  They displayed either positive or negative stories on their Facebook news feed and gauged the response and of course they found that
[00:47:41.551 --> 00:47:43.832]  Quote, the results show emotional contagion.
[00:47:43.892 --> 00:47:48.393]  People who saw negative posts were more likely to respond with their own negative posts.
[00:47:48.973 --> 00:47:58.435]  So, you know, I made a video yesterday asking the question, why does Facebook have a team of scientists conducting secret experiments to manipulate emotions?
[00:47:58.455 --> 00:48:05.257]  And it actually turns out that they changed the terms of agreement after this experiment was conducted to try and make it more ethical.
[00:48:05.877 --> 00:48:16.624]  And I made the connection between the fact that we know authorities in the UK and the US are preparing for these riots, for this domestic disorder, you know, building fake towns, buying riot control gear.
[00:48:16.964 --> 00:48:24.029]  We've also got top economists predicting civil unrest as a result of this soaring food inflation and wealth inequality.
[00:48:24.689 --> 00:48:33.955]  So I made the connection between, you know, they're aware that social revolutions, the Arab Spring, etc., were founded on social media.
[00:48:34.335 --> 00:48:43.102]  And they're very nervous about being able to sway and control social media in terms of gauging dissatisfaction amongst the public.
[00:48:43.522 --> 00:48:56.652]  So in tying it to the fear of riots, the fear of domestic disorder, it actually turns out today that a clear connection has emerged between this Facebook study and the concept of authorities preparing for civil unrest.
[00:48:56.692 --> 00:49:00.255]  Because one of the individuals who conducted the Facebook study
[00:49:00.675 --> 00:49:03.459]  Jeffrey T. Hancock from Cornell University.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:14.294]  He was the same individual who received funding from the Department of Defense, the Pentagon, for a study called Cornell Modeling Discourse and Social Dynamics in Authoritarian Regimes.
[00:49:14.775 --> 00:49:15.315]  And this is
[00:49:15.936 --> 00:49:30.266]  What we talked about last month, this is the Minerva Institute which hit the headlines for its involvement in another DoD program which funds universities to study dynamics and risks to predict large-scale civil unrest around the world.
[00:49:30.766 --> 00:49:41.233]  So this Facebook secret study to manipulate people's emotions was in part created, contrived by one of the same individuals who's working with the Pentagon, with the DoD
[00:49:41.793 --> 00:49:45.316]  To try and model, predict, and prepare for mass civil unrest.
[00:49:45.336 --> 00:49:47.978]  So now we have a clear connection between the two.
[00:49:48.719 --> 00:49:52.722]  Yeah, it's not just a format out there that lets you express yourself.
[00:49:52.782 --> 00:49:56.525]  They're very interested in not only monitoring what people are doing.
[00:49:56.565 --> 00:50:01.469]  We see all the time that they're coming after people for things that were said on Facebook.
[00:50:01.489 --> 00:50:06.312]  So we know that law enforcement at all levels is monitoring Facebook fairly closely.
[00:50:07.213 --> 00:50:14.141]  But the teens who are using it, the adults who are using it, I think they kind of look at this, Paul, as like some kind of a reality TV show.
[00:50:15.222 --> 00:50:20.307]  And I think it's interesting to remember that the very first reality TV show, I think, was Big Brother.
[00:50:21.409 --> 00:50:22.269]  That ought to be telling.
[00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:31.116]  But they look at this and say, well, you know, I guess I can become a celebrity like the people that were on Big Brother if I just expose my life and put all this stuff out there.
[00:50:31.156 --> 00:50:36.579]  But as you pointed out, they're using things to manipulate people.
[00:50:36.619 --> 00:50:38.240]  They're finding a way that they can manipulate people.
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:43.804]  There was in the New York Times article about this, there was a tweet from a privacy activist, Lauren Weinstein.
[00:50:43.824 --> 00:50:51.669]  She says, I wonder if Facebook killed anyone with their emotional manipulation stunt at their scale and with depressed people out there.
[00:50:51.989 --> 00:50:52.570]  It's possible.
[00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:53.891]  That is possible.
[00:50:53.931 --> 00:50:54.771]  So we're going to be right back.
[00:50:54.791 --> 00:50:56.633]  We're going to talk to Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:50:56.653 --> 00:51:03.638]  We're going to be talking to him about what's happening with this and also about perhaps what's going on with the Snowden leaks.
[00:51:03.958 --> 00:51:07.021]  That was pulled back at the last minute by Glenn Greenwald.
[00:51:07.061 --> 00:51:08.682]  We'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:51:10.533 --> 00:51:18.437]  Virtually anyone can hack your cell phone and track your calls, your texts, your emails, your every movement, but only if they can detect a signal.

[00:52:14.529 --> 00:52:17.611]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[00:52:17.871 --> 00:52:19.712]  She's just not the woman I married.
[00:52:19.972 --> 00:52:21.894]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[00:52:22.154 --> 00:52:23.635]  Does this seem familiar?

[00:54:21.047 --> 00:54:24.189]  There's a man going around taking names.
[00:54:24.989 --> 00:54:26.410]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:35.915]  I'm David Knight here in Austin and in the UK we're joined by Paul Joseph Watson and we were just talking before the break about this Facebook experiment.
[00:54:35.995 --> 00:54:42.899]  As some people pointed out, academic protocols generally call for getting people's consent before psychological research is conducted on them.
[00:54:42.939 --> 00:54:44.520]  That's the way the New York Times put it.
[00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:49.661]  Other people said doing psychological testing on people crosses the line.
[00:54:50.221 --> 00:54:51.501]  And of course that's what they were doing.
[00:54:51.541 --> 00:55:00.583]  They were doing psychological testing trying to change people's moods from being positive to being negative or make them depressed.
[00:55:00.643 --> 00:55:03.044]  And of course they found that they were able to do that.
[00:55:03.084 --> 00:55:05.864]  See, Facebook is not just about monitoring you.
[00:55:05.944 --> 00:55:08.205]  It's also about controlling you.
[00:55:09.085 --> 00:55:10.086]  Just like the media.
[00:55:10.426 --> 00:55:15.068]  They're not trying to get people in this experiment to purchase a particular product.
[00:55:15.649 --> 00:55:19.031]  They're trying to make them depressed or make them happy.
[00:55:19.451 --> 00:55:21.472]  And they were successful in doing that, weren't they, Paul?
[00:55:22.745 --> 00:55:23.125]  They were.
[00:55:23.145 --> 00:55:30.372]  The results show that they could manipulate people's moods because the people who saw negative posts then posted their own negative items.
[00:55:30.432 --> 00:55:39.980]  And again, it's been linked to this same individual who's helping the Pentagon prepare for large-scale civil unrest around the world.
[00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:47.647]  So, obviously it indicates that they're preparing to use Facebook and other social media to gauge dissatisfaction amongst the public.
[00:55:48.007 --> 00:55:57.795]  In the hope that they can then manipulate it in order to achieve their own ends, which is obviously to keep people pacified in terms of civil, in times of civil unrest or emergency.
[00:55:58.155 --> 00:55:59.636]  Yeah, the Minerva Project, yes.
[00:56:00.477 --> 00:56:13.067]  And I also find it very alarming that we see that the conditions that were laid down back in the 80s, back in 1984 by Oliver North and Rex 84, as well as Operation Garden Plot,
[00:56:13.968 --> 00:56:22.793]  We see that those conditions that they were laying down, like massive collapse of the border, a massive economic collapse, we see them creating those situations right now.
[00:56:23.353 --> 00:56:34.019]  As you've been pointing out for a number of years, we see in their purchases that they're militarizing the police, but they're also accumulating vast amounts of ammunition and military vehicles.
[00:56:34.519 --> 00:56:40.943]  In every way, they're monitoring and preparing and even initiating a massive economic collapse.
[00:56:42.432 --> 00:56:44.653]  Exactly, that they're preparing for civil unrest.
[00:56:44.713 --> 00:56:47.734]  Whether it arrives or not remains to be seen, but they're gearing up for it.
[00:56:48.274 --> 00:57:04.600]  Also, if you remember back in, I think it was 2007, quite a while ago now, we got a number of pastors who approached us and said that they were part of a FEMA program which was based around pacifying populations in the event of emergencies or civil unrest.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:09.202]  They actually were training the pastors to go out and tell their congregation to quote
[00:57:09.642 --> 00:57:13.425]  Obey government in these times of chaos or disorder.
[00:57:13.806 --> 00:57:27.257]  So these programs, as you said, they go back decades and again with Garden Plot and what came out from Oliver North, immigration, a crisis, an influx of immigrants from across the border was one of the examples they gave.
[00:57:27.757 --> 00:57:32.339]  In which they may be forced to use internment camps to keep people in prison.
[00:57:32.399 --> 00:57:49.987]  So we've had a history of these programs being revealed and now we've got them gaming social media to try and influence people's emotions and the shocking thing is that there is a connection to these preparations for civil unrest and we're going to have an article on InfoWars.com about this very shortly.
[00:57:50.347 --> 00:57:53.828]  And of course we keep hearing from them that it's not a crisis, it's an opportunity.
[00:57:53.868 --> 00:57:58.889]  We hear that not only from Pelosi, but we hear it from high-ranking leaders within the GOP.
[00:57:59.629 --> 00:58:12.132]  In the short time that we've got, I thought it was interesting, and I want to get your take on this, Glenn Greenwald was going to release a large list of people that the NSA had been spying on, that they came across in the Snowden documents.
[00:58:12.472 --> 00:58:15.873]  He was going to release that at midnight last night, and he backed off
[00:58:16.653 --> 00:58:21.117]  Saying that he's been given some new information from the government that he has to consider about that.
[00:58:22.158 --> 00:58:27.323]  We're almost out of time, but I'd like to get your take on that briefly if you can hang around to the next segment there, Paul.
[00:58:27.784 --> 00:58:28.024]  Sure.
[00:58:28.264 --> 00:58:28.805]  Okay, great.
[00:58:29.005 --> 00:58:31.447]  We're going to be right back with Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[00:58:31.828 --> 00:58:35.071]  I'm David Knight here in Austin on the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[00:58:35.131 --> 00:58:38.634]  And Alex is going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour with a report on Agenda 21.
[00:58:38.915 --> 00:58:40.036]  You won't want to miss that.
[00:58:40.456 --> 00:58:43.597]  Also, Peter Van Buren, a former diplomat from Iraq.
[00:58:43.657 --> 00:58:48.119]  He's going to give us his take on Baghdad and the collapse in Iraq.
[00:58:48.139 --> 00:58:49.999]  Stay with us.
[00:58:50.879 --> 00:58:52.720]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:54.321 --> 00:58:56.141]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:00.174 --> 00:59:07.241]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:59:07.341 --> 00:59:09.503]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:59:09.684 --> 00:59:14.809]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:59:14.989 --> 00:59:19.914]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:59:20.134 --> 00:59:23.197]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:59:23.457 --> 00:59:27.320]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:31.784]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:59:31.864 --> 00:59:41.873]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:59:42.093 --> 00:59:44.615]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:59:44.735 --> 00:59:45.635]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:45.655 --> 00:59:47.296]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:16.921]  Big Brother.
[01:00:17.582 --> 01:00:18.603]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:19.344 --> 01:00:20.445]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:21.106 --> 01:00:21.907]  You want answers?
[01:00:22.688 --> 01:00:23.589]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:27.835]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:28.435 --> 01:00:32.481]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:34.628 --> 01:00:35.908]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:35.988 --> 01:00:37.269]  I'm David Knight here in Austin.
[01:00:37.489 --> 01:00:41.590]  I'm your host today, but I'm joined at the moment with Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:44.791]  We've been talking about his articles up on Infowars.com.
[01:00:45.271 --> 01:00:55.695]  One of them is CBS News, and Charlie Rose essentially bragging to the public now about how wonderful these smart streetlights are, that they can track everything we do all the time.
[01:00:56.215 --> 01:00:58.235]  But don't worry, it's all about saving energy.
[01:00:58.575 --> 01:01:03.837]  But they keep throwing in these references to Orwell, talking about a, isn't this Orwellian?
[01:01:03.857 --> 01:01:20.720]  They mention that several times in it, they talk about how they've got a global network, they talk about how they're going to be able to use it to protect the children at school, because they're also going to be able to not just track your movements, not just read your license plate, but they're going to be able to determine if somebody's got a gun on them.
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:31.178]  That's what these streetlights are capable of, and as Paul mentioned, they've already, it's already come out that these streetlights are capable of recording and storing phone conversations.
[01:01:31.819 --> 01:01:34.463]  It really is a panopticon, isn't it, Paul?
[01:01:35.936 --> 01:01:44.220]  Well precisely, and of course the interest in all this was rejuvenated last year by the Snowden revelations, as you mentioned before the break.
[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:56.027]  Now, Greenwald is saying that he had this big revelation coming whereby we would learn exactly what organisations and individuals the NSA was spying on directly.
[01:01:56.647 --> 01:02:07.695]  Now he's delayed it after announcing that it would be released at midnight last night because he says the United States government suddenly began making new last-minute claims which we intend to investigate before publishing.
[01:02:08.076 --> 01:02:17.223]  Which is surprising because if you read his book, the same thing happened on numerous occasions right before a new Snowden revelation was due to be released.
[01:02:17.643 --> 01:02:22.507]  The US government tried to put pressure on not only Greenwald but also the Guardian newspaper
[01:02:22.947 --> 01:02:24.830]  Not to release that story.
[01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:27.072]  So, you know, he defied them then.
[01:02:27.092 --> 01:02:33.701]  He refused to listen to anything they had to say, but now he's apparently listened to their concerns and has delayed the story.
[01:02:34.021 --> 01:02:38.026]  There's also another aspect to it, which is that, and this is on Infowars.com today,
[01:02:38.667 --> 01:02:49.989]  The leak whistleblower website Cryptone.org has announced that they're going to release all the Snowden documents later this month, quote, in order to avert a war.
[01:02:50.469 --> 01:03:03.212]  So of course, whereas Greenwald has been doling them out one by one slowly, which is probably the best method to keep it in the news, Cryptone has announced that they're set to release all the Snowden documents in one huge data dump.
[01:03:03.292 --> 01:03:03.432]  So
[01:03:04.393 --> 01:03:13.794]  That will satisfy some of the people who have called for that, but also will kind of derail it being in the news constantly by Greenwald's preferred method of doling them out.
[01:03:14.693 --> 01:03:17.114]  Well, and of course, you know, you can look at that any number of ways.
[01:03:17.194 --> 01:03:19.655]  I mean, personally, I want to see them all come out.
[01:03:19.715 --> 01:03:33.320]  I think we're perfectly capable of having a crowd-sourced investigation, and I think a lot of people have been uncomfortable with the way they've been doled out to keep it in the news as to promote his book or whatever, and so I welcome the fact that they will come out.
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:35.321]  I'm kind of concerned about Cryptome.
[01:03:35.401 --> 01:03:40.003]  I hope that they're not going to get shut down by talking about this earlier, but I think
[01:03:40.723 --> 01:03:45.926]  The danger of putting these, I mean, you can say, you can make a case on either side of this.
[01:03:45.946 --> 01:03:55.332]  You can say that it keeps it in the news, but the other thing that you could say is that perhaps it, by pulling it out one piece at a time, maybe it's getting people too accustomed to it.
[01:03:55.372 --> 01:03:57.513]  Maybe if it was a giant shock all at once.
[01:03:57.594 --> 01:04:01.196]  So hopefully there's a lot of stuff here that's going to shock people.
[01:04:01.456 --> 01:04:02.737]  I was looking forward to
[01:04:03.637 --> 01:04:14.170]  Uh, this, this leak because I thought that finally some of these people who may be surprised that they are being watched might get galvanized to take action rather than, uh, sit on the sidelines.
[01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:19.236]  What you were just talking about before, the panoptagon effect of trying to intimidate people to not say anything.
[01:04:19.256 --> 01:04:21.739]  Hey, if you know your name's on the list, go for it.
[01:04:23.325 --> 01:04:29.789]  Well precisely, and it would be fascinating to find out who is on that list, but I mean... I hope we're on it!
[01:04:29.889 --> 01:04:31.790]  I'd be disappointed if we're not on it, wouldn't you?
[01:04:31.870 --> 01:04:44.799]  I mean... In some fashion I would hope that we were on it, whether they were just monitoring our content or, you know, Alex individually or whoever, I would hope that we were on it, because it is... it's a kind of badge of honor, like you said, once you get past the point of fear, it's like...
[01:04:45.279 --> 01:04:46.561]  I don't care if you're watching me.
[01:04:46.621 --> 01:04:47.162]  That's right.
[01:04:47.242 --> 01:04:50.767]  If you're over the target and you're taking flight, then that's all well and good.
[01:04:50.827 --> 01:04:59.979]  But, yeah, if they dump the whole document, there are going to be a thousand different writers and researchers, me included, who are going to be digging into it for new stories.
[01:05:00.259 --> 01:05:01.741]  It's an information war, isn't it, Paul?
[01:05:02.262 --> 01:05:05.403]  It's an information war and once you get past your first battle, it's like a real war.
[01:05:05.583 --> 01:05:06.724]  You're in it at that point.
[01:05:07.104 --> 01:05:08.204]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:05:08.244 --> 01:05:09.705]  Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[01:05:09.745 --> 01:05:10.125]  Stay with us.
[01:05:10.145 --> 01:05:10.625]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:10.645 --> 01:05:12.346]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:05:12.686 --> 01:05:20.628]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:05:20.708 --> 01:05:27.771]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:05:28.251 --> 01:05:32.574]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that was some good stuff.
[01:05:32.854 --> 01:05:43.020]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:49.684]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[01:06:10.276 --> 01:06:14.259]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:06:14.299 --> 01:06:18.463]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:06:18.683 --> 01:06:22.086]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:06:22.346 --> 01:06:25.228]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:06:25.369 --> 01:06:32.735]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:06:32.955 --> 01:06:36.598]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:06:36.838 --> 01:06:41.099]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:06:41.279 --> 01:06:47.201]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:06:47.241 --> 01:06:51.021]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:06:51.161 --> 01:06:53.722]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:06:53.922 --> 01:06:55.262]  The establishment is not going to do it.
[01:06:55.422 --> 01:06:56.643]  It's time to take action.
[01:06:56.783 --> 01:06:58.483]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:12.850]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[01:07:13.371 --> 01:07:20.335]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[01:07:20.795 --> 01:07:31.242]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[01:07:31.643 --> 01:07:40.869]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:45.010]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[01:07:45.650 --> 01:07:49.071]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[01:07:49.431 --> 01:07:50.971]  Experience the new formula.
[01:07:51.471 --> 01:07:53.452]  Experience the ancient purity.
[01:07:54.052 --> 01:07:55.012]  Shield your family.
[01:07:55.372 --> 01:07:56.773]  Survival Shield X2.

[01:08:11.724 --> 01:08:16.777]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:17.138 --> 01:08:19.424]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:23.567 --> 01:08:24.848]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:24.948 --> 01:08:26.109]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:34.333]  Up on N4Wars.com we have an article, Obama orders more troops, gunships and drones to Iraq.
[01:08:34.554 --> 01:08:40.837]  It says this announcement will bring to nearly 800 total number of US forces going back to Iraq.
[01:08:41.498 --> 01:08:44.279]  Now remember, at first he wasn't going to send anybody.
[01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:45.540]  Then it was going to be 300.
[01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:47.941]  Then it became 500.
[01:08:48.482 --> 01:08:49.582]  Now we've confirmed it's 800.
[01:08:51.032 --> 01:09:02.977]  Paul Joseph Watson, who I was just talking to in the UK, has been sent communications from many people in the military saying that their training and their entire units are going in February of next year.
[01:09:03.097 --> 01:09:07.099]  So this is a re-escalation of the war in Iraq.
[01:09:07.839 --> 01:09:10.960]  We're going to have joining us in the third hour, Peter Van Buren.
[01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:11.960]  He was a U.S.
[01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:13.361]  diplomat for 23 years.
[01:09:13.421 --> 01:09:20.663]  He spent time in Iraq as part of the effort to quote-unquote reconstitute Iraq or to reconstruct it.
[01:09:21.923 --> 01:09:30.325]  As somebody from the south who knows that history, when I hear the words reconstruction, I grab for my gun because I know what they did there.
[01:09:30.686 --> 01:09:35.427]  But they're going to reconstruct an area that they've already destroyed.
[01:09:36.408 --> 01:09:38.229]  We're going to talk to him about what he saw in Iraq.
[01:09:38.270 --> 01:09:57.885]  We're going to talk to him about the embassy there in Iraq, this massive presence there, as well as the revelations that came out from the New York Times on Sunday about the attitude of Blackwater, threatening State Department investigators, saying, if you bother me, I will kill you.
[01:09:58.126 --> 01:10:01.829]  And there's nothing anyone could or would do about it, because this is Iraq.
[01:10:02.850 --> 01:10:06.134]  That's what Blackwater was telling State Department investigators.
[01:10:06.174 --> 01:10:07.955]  So we're going to talk to Peter Van Buren about that.
[01:10:08.476 --> 01:10:14.803]  We're also going to talk to him about his book, Ghost of Tom Joe, the story of the 99%.
[01:10:15.524 --> 01:10:21.850]  And of course, today in the news on BBC, we have an internet billionaire, Nick Hanauer, who warns of a coming revolution.
[01:10:22.651 --> 01:10:28.178]  He's made a lot of money off of the internet, and he has a warning for his fellow gazillionaires.
[01:10:28.258 --> 01:10:34.846]  He says, if we don't do something to fix the glaring inequities in this economy, the pitchforks are going to be coming for us.
[01:10:35.708 --> 01:10:37.229]  He says, do you think the U.S.
[01:10:37.289 --> 01:10:37.750]  is special?
[01:10:38.351 --> 01:10:38.912]  Is it different?
[01:10:39.787 --> 01:10:40.387]  You're wrong.
[01:10:40.447 --> 01:10:41.747]  No nation is immune.
[01:10:41.787 --> 01:10:45.048]  Just ask the Russian czars or the French aristocracy.
[01:10:45.128 --> 01:10:48.649]  And so, we're going to be talking to Peter Van Buren about the ghost of Tom Jode.
[01:10:49.029 --> 01:10:53.810]  He takes the story, of course, Tom Jode is the character, if you remember, from The Grapes of Wrath.
[01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:57.451]  It was the central character, the character played by Henry Fonda in the movie.
[01:10:58.231 --> 01:11:02.512]  He kind of updates that from the Great Depression to the 1950s and on.
[01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:05.053]  So instead of the Dust Bowl, we've got the Rust Belt.
[01:11:05.673 --> 01:11:08.014]  And he updates that idea.
[01:11:08.054 --> 01:11:08.314]  Now, this
[01:11:09.929 --> 01:11:17.932]  Billionaire here, the Nick Hanauer, who was speaking in the BBC, he thinks this can all be saved by creating a new minimum wage.
[01:11:18.372 --> 01:11:21.833]  I don't think that you can mandate wealth out of the central government.
[01:11:21.953 --> 01:11:25.354]  I think that what we ought to mandate is freedom and dignity.
[01:11:25.414 --> 01:11:27.795]  Maybe we ought to mandate the Bill of Rights.
[01:11:28.695 --> 01:11:31.857]  If we do that sort of thing, that's what's going to turn it around.
[01:11:32.217 --> 01:11:34.618]  It's people having control of their life.
[01:11:34.678 --> 01:11:45.083]  If they have control and freedom in their life, if everything is not owned by just a handful of people, if we stop this consolidation somehow, and I think the way to do it
[01:11:45.763 --> 01:11:49.988]  is to not allow the government to become the instrument of these corporations.
[01:11:50.048 --> 01:11:53.833]  They always use the government to shut down competition.
[01:11:54.274 --> 01:11:57.257]  So I think the key thing is to establish individual rights.
[01:11:57.838 --> 01:12:04.726]  Certainly isn't going to help, I don't think, to raise minimum wages because that just gets eaten up by inflation.
[01:12:05.367 --> 01:12:09.430]  Now of course there's breaking news on the immigration front as well.
[01:12:09.531 --> 01:12:17.117]  We see that a sheriff has said that we come across decomposed bodies of immigrants quite often, as reported by CBS News.
[01:12:17.797 --> 01:12:21.640]  Isn't it interesting that there's been so much said about the three teenagers in Israel
[01:12:22.694 --> 01:12:23.355]  Who were killed.
[01:12:24.216 --> 01:12:35.269]  And yet, people are not talking about the admissions of this sheriff and others who are saying, after they found this 11-year-old Guatemalan boy, the sheriff says, down here, finding a decomposed body?
[01:12:35.589 --> 01:12:37.351]  Well, we come across them quite often.
[01:12:37.391 --> 01:12:39.094]  And that's Sheriff Eddie Guerra.
[01:12:40.273 --> 01:12:46.196]  See, the person who is creating these types of circumstances, of course, is Barack Obama.
[01:12:46.276 --> 01:12:51.618]  As the Border Patrol agents who have talked to us have said, nothing has changed in those countries recently.
[01:12:52.078 --> 01:12:58.061]  What has changed is the way the immigrants are being handled, and the messages that's being sent to them.
[01:12:58.581 --> 01:13:06.225]  So we've got some reports, we've had reporters down there at the border, and we've got a report from John Bound about the real problem.
[01:13:06.705 --> 01:13:07.285]  Terrorists.
[01:13:07.626 --> 01:13:07.966]  We have
[01:13:08.726 --> 01:13:12.388]  The people at the TSA coming down and everybody, what about our open borders?
[01:13:12.448 --> 01:13:13.609]  Here's John Bowne's report.
[01:13:14.189 --> 01:13:19.353]  These cities just above the US-Mexico border don't receive any federal funding.
[01:13:19.973 --> 01:13:32.761]  The law-abiding, land-owning residents of towns such as Falfurrias, Texas are overrun by a tsunami of illegals as a result of what's called the funnel effect.
[01:13:33.021 --> 01:13:47.031]  The militarization of the border, which includes checkpoints, barriers, and security technology, diverts the human smuggling operations into treacherous, searing, and rugged terrain that delivers many illegal aliens to their deaths.
[01:13:47.331 --> 01:13:53.395]  And ranch owners and Texas border volunteer founders Mike and Linda Vickers contending with the outcome.
[01:13:53.655 --> 01:14:00.317]  What they're about to tell you may cause alarm, because America isn't simply being invaded by countries south of its border.
[01:14:00.837 --> 01:14:05.038]  It is increasingly being invaded by countries from all over the world.
[01:14:05.198 --> 01:14:09.579]  Can you speak about your organization and explain where some of your volunteers come from and who they are?
[01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:12.940]  Actually, we even have a lot of out-of-staters.
[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:18.961]  Nebraska, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Oklahoma, many from Florida.
[01:14:20.281 --> 01:14:27.565]  Part of our mission is to enforce, or help, assist Border Patrol and other law enforcement entities out here.
[01:14:27.805 --> 01:14:43.812]  We will post out on these heavily trafficked areas and report specific numbers to Border Patrol, specific locations, and they have learned that we're a big help.
[01:14:43.952 --> 01:14:45.792]  We're like extra eyes and ears out here.
[01:14:47.853 --> 01:15:04.844]  We also, a big part of our mission is awareness and we do many speaking engagements to let people know exactly what's going on out here and what we're seeing despite what others say in high political offices that the border is safe.
[01:15:05.684 --> 01:15:07.145]  These border towns are safe.
[01:15:07.526 --> 01:15:08.026]  It is not.
[01:15:08.366 --> 01:15:15.831]  Our ranch gate is 69 miles north of the bridge in Hidalgo that goes into Rionosa, Mexico.
[01:15:15.851 --> 01:15:17.252]  A little over a day's walk.
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:21.221]  Well, actually, most of these people don't walk 69 miles.
[01:15:21.241 --> 01:15:33.406]  They all pay a criminal organization, mainly the cartels, big money to be brought up here and let out south of this Border Patrol checkpoint, four and a half miles south of our ranch on U.S.
[01:15:33.426 --> 01:15:33.786]  Highway 281.
[01:15:35.607 --> 01:15:39.769]  They're all contributing to organized crime by paying large sums of money to be brought in here.
[01:15:39.809 --> 01:15:43.790]  And to give you an example, the Chinese are paying $50,000.
[01:15:43.950 --> 01:15:46.051]  The Indians are paying $10,000 to $20,000.
[01:15:46.571 --> 01:15:48.732]  All the Central Americans, the average is about $7,000.
[01:15:48.872 --> 01:15:54.154]  So, and the Mexicans, especially Southern Mexico, are paying $3,000.
[01:15:54.214 --> 01:15:54.774]  So, it's a huge, huge
[01:15:58.256 --> 01:16:03.418]  money event for the cartels probably even more lucrative than the drug business.
[01:16:03.679 --> 01:16:09.222]  What percentage are you seeing from places other than South and Central America?
[01:16:09.302 --> 01:16:21.388]  The Border Patrol and Homeland Security categorize the people that are not from Mexico as other than Mexicans and prior to last night they were it was running about 73 percent
[01:16:23.075 --> 01:16:28.179]  of the people apprehended in the Rio Grande Valley or OTMs, other than Mexican.
[01:16:28.199 --> 01:16:33.362]  A lot of Central Americans, but really from all over the world.
[01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:38.506]  And we were informed last night that that number has escalated to 80%.
[01:16:39.967 --> 01:16:43.549]  So, and this is a fact.
[01:16:43.589 --> 01:16:45.591]  So most of the people that we encounter here
[01:16:46.437 --> 01:16:50.221]  A larger percentage of them are people from other countries other than Mexico.
[01:16:50.281 --> 01:16:53.283]  And we're not told about the special interest aliens.
[01:16:53.904 --> 01:16:56.286]  We have had Somalians here.
[01:16:56.666 --> 01:17:03.252]  Once they got on that special alien list, they won't tell us that anymore.
[01:17:03.332 --> 01:17:11.759]  But there have been Somalians, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Chinese, you name it, we've had it here.
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:12.880]  We've also
[01:17:14.376 --> 01:17:27.468]  Found evidence that people from these special interest countries in particular Pakistan and Afghanistan Iran Are coming through our property During one of our Texas border volunteer operations last year.
[01:17:27.948 --> 01:17:38.577]  We had a group of ten We spotted we followed them informed the Border Patrol where they were going to come out on the highway Border Patrol were not able to respond fast enough.
[01:17:38.618 --> 01:17:40.219]  They got they climbed the fence and
[01:17:41.116 --> 01:17:45.698]  And loaded up and left and were not caught.
[01:17:46.639 --> 01:17:51.301]  But as one of them was climbing over the fence, he dropped a package.
[01:17:52.728 --> 01:17:55.851]  And that package was an Urdu dictionary.
[01:17:55.931 --> 01:18:00.315]  Urdu is a language spoken in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
[01:18:01.056 --> 01:18:09.264]  And in that translation book, Urdu and English, there were a lot of phrases circled and outlined.
[01:18:09.884 --> 01:18:11.025]  Do you speak Spanish?
[01:18:11.706 --> 01:18:12.647]  Do you speak English?
[01:18:13.468 --> 01:18:14.689]  You must pay in dollars?
[01:18:15.882 --> 01:18:29.769]  So we know that special interest countries in particular countries like Pakistan or Afghanistan that are not particularly friendly with our country are slipping through here under the disguise of and under the
[01:18:30.835 --> 01:18:38.557]  Uh, all this other activity that's going on where these families are given up and and the Border Patrol resources are being compromised.
[01:18:39.137 --> 01:18:42.098]  So it's easier for them to slip through this private property.
[01:18:42.678 --> 01:18:43.998]  And that's just one example.
[01:18:44.218 --> 01:18:50.359]  And more recently, within the past two weeks, some Iranian money was found in a bailout vehicle.
[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:52.920]  So we know they're coming in here.
[01:18:53.140 --> 01:19:07.257]  Besides that Iranian money being found in a bailout vehicle up here, four Syrians, which is not, you know, public news yet, but four Syrians were apprehended on the Rio Grande River a couple days ago.
[01:19:07.437 --> 01:19:10.701]  We're never divulged the special interest aliens.
[01:19:11.922 --> 01:19:14.165]  But I think it's time America gets alarmed.
[01:19:14.806 --> 01:19:16.668]  They've already come through here.
[01:19:16.748 --> 01:19:18.891]  It's us, it's the humanitarian crisis.
[01:19:19.251 --> 01:19:20.934]  And it's an OTM crisis.
[01:19:21.815 --> 01:19:24.378]  Just take out the factor of the women and children.
[01:19:24.498 --> 01:19:26.841]  It's an other than Mexican crisis right now.
[01:19:27.242 --> 01:19:28.804]  We're being invaded.
[01:19:29.364 --> 01:19:32.068]  We don't have time for that full report, but you can see it.
[01:19:32.088 --> 01:19:32.748]  It's up on YouTube now.
[01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:35.732]  That report is Borders are Wide Open to Terrorists.
[01:19:35.752 --> 01:19:36.193]  Red Alert!
[01:19:47.611 --> 01:19:49.992]  That's John Bowne's report down at the border.

[01:22:17.131 --> 01:22:25.015]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:25.255 --> 01:22:29.558]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.

[01:23:48.502 --> 01:23:49.702]  Chaos on our border.
[01:23:50.122 --> 01:23:52.183]  China and Russia bypassing the dollar.
[01:23:52.643 --> 01:23:54.203]  Life is getting ready to change.

[01:23:57.604 --> 01:24:00.785]  Go to babyboomerbackupplan.com or call 888-507-8789.
[01:24:00.825 --> 01:24:01.005]  That's 888-507-8789.
[01:24:22.375 --> 01:24:23.676]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:23.796 --> 01:24:24.557]  I'm David Knight.
[01:24:25.097 --> 01:24:29.721]  We're going to be joined in the next segment by Alex Jones with a special report on Agenda 21.
[01:24:30.001 --> 01:24:30.882]  You won't want to miss that.
[01:24:31.623 --> 01:24:34.465]  Yesterday we had a landmark Supreme Court decision.
[01:24:35.326 --> 01:24:43.393]  We had a test of government mandates to buy things versus our First Amendment rights about the free exercise of religion.
[01:24:43.933 --> 01:24:49.157]  And surprisingly, the Supreme Court came down on the side of the Constitution.
[01:24:49.938 --> 01:24:57.342]  But just narrowly, a 5-4 decision, and some of the justices on the dissenting side were very angry about that.
[01:24:57.682 --> 01:25:01.344]  Ginsburg wrote, anyone can assert their religious objections.
[01:25:01.364 --> 01:25:02.704]  This is just too radical.
[01:25:03.365 --> 01:25:05.746]  Yeah, freedom is a radical idea.
[01:25:06.146 --> 01:25:10.889]  So is individual liberty, and it's not just about holding beliefs.
[01:25:11.409 --> 01:25:14.050]  It's about the free exercise of beliefs.
[01:25:14.590 --> 01:25:18.292]  Kagan wrote, Congress gave this as an entitlement.
[01:25:18.332 --> 01:25:19.053]  This is a law.
[01:25:19.713 --> 01:25:27.656]  Well, the First Amendment says you shall make no law abridging freedom of speech or the free exercise of religion.
[01:25:28.176 --> 01:25:30.057]  Now we have some quotes from Hillary Clinton.
[01:25:30.697 --> 01:25:35.178]  She said that she thought that this was very disturbing, deeply disturbing.
[01:25:35.838 --> 01:25:38.399]  She got very animated when she was asked about this.
[01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:45.542]  They say that she delivered a fiery and impassioned reply, calling it deeply disturbing, among other things.
[01:25:45.962 --> 01:25:48.743]  I want to focus on what Nancy Pelosi said, though.
[01:25:49.483 --> 01:25:53.409]  She had, I think, the most interesting take on this.
[01:25:54.430 --> 01:26:00.278]  She said that this is a gross violation of workers' religious rights.
[01:26:00.999 --> 01:26:02.822]  Ooh, their religious rights.
[01:26:03.423 --> 01:26:04.985]  Let's think about that for a moment.
[01:26:06.047 --> 01:26:09.268]  Is this really about the exercise of religion?
[01:26:09.288 --> 01:26:13.109]  We had a lot of people come back and say that that was shameless.
[01:26:13.149 --> 01:26:16.050]  They said, are you on some kind of medication?
[01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:17.691]  Religious rights violation?
[01:26:17.731 --> 01:26:20.432]  You'll see a lot of these collected on twitchy.com.
[01:26:21.872 --> 01:26:24.133]  Well, they're laughing about what she says.
[01:26:24.513 --> 01:26:35.355]  She also tweeted out that SCOTUS, that's the Supreme Court, took an outrageous step against women's rights, setting a dangerous precedent that permits corporations to choose which laws to obey.
[01:26:35.375 --> 01:26:41.916]  To which somebody said, oh, you mean like your president and how he only obeys the laws that suit him?
[01:26:42.316 --> 01:26:43.857]  So they're pointing out that hypocrisy.
[01:26:43.877 --> 01:26:48.738]  They're pointing out that this isn't about religious rights of women.
[01:26:49.758 --> 01:26:50.518]  But it really is.
[01:26:50.979 --> 01:26:51.579]  It really is.
[01:26:51.679 --> 01:26:58.202]  Because, see, from Nancy Pelosi's standpoint, from the feminist's standpoint, it really is a religion.
[01:26:58.382 --> 01:27:02.364]  You have to understand that abortion to them is like a sacrament.
[01:27:03.237 --> 01:27:08.621]  Listen to what the National Abortion Rights Action League said about this decision.
[01:27:09.302 --> 01:27:13.585]  Elisa Hoag, president of Naral Pro-Choice America, condemned the ruling.
[01:27:14.146 --> 01:27:17.769]  I am saddened and disappointed and actually quite disturbed.
[01:27:17.869 --> 01:27:25.315]  It is a rough day in our country when five male justices rule that discrimination against women is not discrimination at all.
[01:27:26.135 --> 01:27:36.262]  99% of women use birth control at some point in our lifetime and the justices show that they're out of touch when they support bosses who want to reach beyond the boardroom into our bedrooms.
[01:27:36.442 --> 01:27:38.403]  It's not what this country stands for.
[01:27:40.064 --> 01:27:44.047]  Okay, you heard her say that 99% of women use contraceptives.
[01:27:45.187 --> 01:27:51.692]  We also know that 85% of companies provided that kind of coverage before the Obama mandates.
[01:27:52.659 --> 01:27:59.049]  Now, boardrooms are not reaching into the bedrooms of people to stop them from doing anything that they want.
[01:27:59.710 --> 01:28:02.334]  The coercion is the other way around.
[01:28:03.464 --> 01:28:04.725]  Ron Paul had this to say.
[01:28:04.785 --> 01:28:07.728]  This is up on the article that we have on Infowars.com.
[01:28:07.748 --> 01:28:15.216]  He said, I think the most profoundly confusing argument has been the argument that not being able to get free birth control is discriminating against women.
[01:28:15.296 --> 01:28:16.657]  This to me is utterly amazing.
[01:28:17.078 --> 01:28:23.024]  If somebody wants something, and they wish to have something, they demand something, they say they have a right to it.
[01:28:23.044 --> 01:28:24.185]  That's absolutely wrong.
[01:28:24.545 --> 01:28:27.448]  That's why we have this runaway welfare state.
[01:28:27.488 --> 01:28:28.689]  That's what Ron Paul said about it.
[01:28:28.749 --> 01:28:29.991]  He's exactly right.
[01:28:30.491 --> 01:28:32.974]  They're not denying them the right to take this.
[01:28:33.074 --> 01:28:38.919]  What they're saying is that they have religious convictions and they cannot be compelled to violate those.
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:44.962]  And quite frankly, I think if they hadn't got... I believe that Chief Justice Roberts was blackmailed.
[01:28:45.002 --> 01:28:50.664]  We now know, everybody knows, that the government is watching everything that everybody is doing.
[01:28:51.284 --> 01:28:52.324]  Everyone believes that now.
[01:28:52.364 --> 01:28:56.646]  We've been telling you that at Infowars.com for a very long time, but now it's common knowledge.
[01:28:57.066 --> 01:28:59.067]  Who do you think they're going to be watching most closely?
[01:28:59.807 --> 01:29:06.329]  Well, it's going to be the Chief Justices of the Supreme Court or the Supreme Court Justices, people in power, congressmen.
[01:29:06.769 --> 01:29:15.252]  I think that's what's behind this nine to nothing decision this last week that said that they have to have a search warrant in order to search people's phones.
[01:29:15.372 --> 01:29:19.273]  I think the Supreme Court has been a victim of this kind of blackmail.
[01:29:19.353 --> 01:29:24.694]  How else could Chief Justice Roberts write both the dissenting and the majority opinion on this?
[01:29:24.994 --> 01:29:26.835]  Do a very quick 180 saying that
[01:29:27.395 --> 01:29:29.696]  This is not an unconstitutional mandate.
[01:29:29.756 --> 01:29:30.856]  It's simply a tax.
[01:29:31.056 --> 01:29:33.417]  No, it is an unconstitutional mandate.
[01:29:33.777 --> 01:29:41.700]  I'm very glad that Hobby Lobby and this other small company stood up for their rights, put their lives and their property on the line.
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:44.982]  That's what the founders of this country did to get their rights.
[01:29:45.062 --> 01:29:48.643]  We need more people like them who will take this to the mat.
[01:29:49.483 --> 01:29:52.964]  We're going to be right back with Alex Jones and a special report on Agenda 21.
[01:29:53.084 --> 01:29:53.565]  Stay with us.
[01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:02.566]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.487 --> 01:30:06.192]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.504 --> 01:30:16.547]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[01:30:16.607 --> 01:30:19.929]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:30:19.949 --> 01:30:21.650]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[01:30:21.710 --> 01:30:27.973]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:30:28.073 --> 01:30:33.976]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote homeless security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[01:30:34.136 --> 01:30:37.899]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:30:38.079 --> 01:30:40.961]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:30:40.981 --> 01:30:49.167]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:30:49.427 --> 01:30:51.489]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:30:51.529 --> 01:30:52.570]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:30:52.930 --> 01:31:01.680]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[01:31:01.901 --> 01:31:04.343]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.
[01:31:04.544 --> 01:31:08.849]  Become a member, share your membership, and help take the info war to the next level.
[01:31:10.516 --> 01:31:16.479]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:31:16.679 --> 01:31:20.861]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:31:21.242 --> 01:31:25.804]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:31:26.224 --> 01:31:28.845]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:31:29.145 --> 01:31:34.326]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:31:34.606 --> 01:31:41.467]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:31:41.967 --> 01:31:45.728]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:31:46.108 --> 01:31:50.889]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:51.209 --> 01:31:52.069]  This is innovating.
[01:31:52.349 --> 01:31:59.654]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:31:59.834 --> 01:32:03.896]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[01:32:04.096 --> 01:32:09.260]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:32:10.197 --> 01:32:12.078]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:32:12.418 --> 01:32:20.341]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:32:20.461 --> 01:32:27.524]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:32:28.004 --> 01:32:32.266]  I just received my Male Vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[01:32:32.586 --> 01:32:42.769]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:32:43.229 --> 01:32:49.390]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:32:49.710 --> 01:32:51.931]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:32:51.951 --> 01:32:55.932]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and getting the day started.
[01:32:56.092 --> 01:32:57.693]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[01:32:58.033 --> 01:33:01.974]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.
[01:33:02.214 --> 01:33:09.157]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[01:33:10.798 --> 01:33:15.800]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.604 --> 01:33:32.292]  My friends, thank you for joining us today here on the Radio Slash Television Transmission.
[01:33:32.752 --> 01:33:37.579]  We're going to be going back to David Knight in the radio studio here in just a few minutes.
[01:33:38.260 --> 01:33:42.966]  But I wanted to spend some time breaking down
[01:33:44.522 --> 01:34:07.938]  What's transpired since UN Agenda 21 was globally ratified by the United Nations back in 1992 to be international law, whether nations want to adopt the law or not, as far as the UN sees it and the eugenicists globalists that control it, they are going to enforce it by hook or by crook.
[01:34:08.558 --> 01:34:13.382]  In the past, people like Napoleon Bonaparte and Adolf Hitler in Europe tried to take over by force.
[01:34:14.321 --> 01:34:20.045]  But the corporatist learned that what can't be done with force can be done by stealth.
[01:34:20.165 --> 01:34:27.890]  So I wanted to go back into the archives here in a few minutes and play some clips here for the radio and TV audience today.
[01:34:29.511 --> 01:34:40.375]  Excerpts from my 1997 film that I produced with my cousin who's been working here off and on since, Buckley Hammond, who ran camera with me.
[01:34:41.195 --> 01:34:45.557]  And I just mention that fact because he's recently come back to work with us after being gone for about 11 years.
[01:34:45.597 --> 01:34:47.398]  We're very excited to have him here.
[01:34:47.698 --> 01:34:52.359]  But when I shot and directed and produced this film back in 1997, almost no one
[01:34:56.661 --> 01:34:58.062]  Was aware of what's in the 21.
[01:34:58.643 --> 01:35:01.264]  Almost no one was aware of Cloward and Piven.
[01:35:02.025 --> 01:35:06.729]  And the plan to bring in neo-feudalism in the UN's own words.
[01:35:07.429 --> 01:35:14.734]  And we cover that in the film Endgame with Dr. Michael Kaufman, whose maps in Congress off the UN documents showed half the country
[01:35:15.695 --> 01:35:23.238]  Off limits to human activity completely, then the rest of it only under partial human use.
[01:35:23.758 --> 01:35:29.220]  And again, that's down to the mile land controlled by the establishment.
[01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:37.604]  So it's a form of artificial scarcity, not just here in the U.S., but worldwide to shut down your competition in business, real estate, industry.
[01:35:38.564 --> 01:35:42.089]  Where only you are allowed to operate and no one else is.
[01:35:42.669 --> 01:35:45.112]  A form of corporate or diplomatic immunity.
[01:35:45.513 --> 01:35:47.475]  From taxes, regulations, you name it.
[01:35:47.636 --> 01:35:51.020]  And I know I hammer this almost every week because it's so key.
[01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:52.241]  It's how the world really works.
[01:35:53.693 --> 01:36:08.821]  And the globalists are quite public about that, but I wanted to just look at a quick web search under environmental tyranny and agenda 21 that Rob Dew did today and just go over some of the recent history of what's been unfolding.
[01:36:09.642 --> 01:36:12.323]  First off, I want to look at the New York Times.
[01:36:14.525 --> 01:36:18.647]  They are pretty much the establishment talking point propaganda center.
[01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:27.623]  For the rest of the dinosaur media, and for the last few years, this was in 2012, they have been running around
[01:36:29.466 --> 01:36:46.277]  Saying that there is no Agenda 21, there is no move to control human activity, there is no move to use zoning as a form of feudalism to bring in a new dark age of control, even though that's in the Biological Diversity Assessment 1996 and part of Agenda 21 to 1992.
[01:36:46.777 --> 01:36:47.298]  But here it is.
[01:36:47.318 --> 01:36:49.339]  Activists fight green projects seeing UN plot.
[01:36:56.957 --> 01:36:58.278]  And they're like, oh, it's so terrible.
[01:36:58.779 --> 01:37:08.329]  These projects we have to basically federalize every town in the country by getting cities to adopt these regulations to circumvent the states and go under U.N.
[01:37:08.409 --> 01:37:08.809]  treaty.
[01:37:09.330 --> 01:37:10.691]  Oh, my gosh, it's insane.
[01:37:10.791 --> 01:37:11.812]  It doesn't exist.
[01:37:12.313 --> 01:37:13.954]  None of it is happening.
[01:37:14.695 --> 01:37:19.020]  So I thought I would just show you here, if you're a TV viewer or director of your radio listener,
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:20.341]  Even Wikipedia.
[01:37:20.841 --> 01:37:25.245]  Everybody knows Wikipedia is not totally accurate when it gets vandalized, but usually it's very accurate.
[01:37:25.565 --> 01:37:39.296]  You go to the bibliography on Agenda 21, on Wikipedia, and you can see the bibliography to all the government documents and the official UN website where it's on record.
[01:37:39.956 --> 01:37:46.522]  And this is the so-called voluntary implemented action plan of the United Nations.
[01:37:47.242 --> 01:37:53.667]  That's not really true, because through adjoining treaties in UNESCO, it is brought into law.
[01:37:53.707 --> 01:37:59.351]  But the point is, it does exist, despite what the New York Times says.
[01:37:59.971 --> 01:38:07.757]  And it shows the New York Times has lost a lot of power, because famously they did a review of the film New World Order that came out about a year after Bilderberg 2008.
[01:38:10.011 --> 01:38:11.952]  Where Obama and Hillary were meeting in secret.
[01:38:11.972 --> 01:38:12.792]  We got video of this.
[01:38:13.413 --> 01:38:22.216]  They said that I was there imagining they were meeting, having a full-on hallucination at the Marriott in Chantilly, Virginia.
[01:38:23.377 --> 01:38:25.598]  Even though now it's totally admitted to have happened.
[01:38:26.578 --> 01:38:29.340]  Remember the New York Times said none of that even went on.
[01:38:29.860 --> 01:38:32.901]  Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
[01:38:33.081 --> 01:38:33.682]  Move along.
[01:38:34.122 --> 01:38:34.642]  Move along.
[01:38:34.702 --> 01:38:38.904]  These aren't the droids you're looking for.
[01:38:39.778 --> 01:38:44.381]  But again, the good news is people are seeing the manifestation of agenda 21.
[01:38:45.021 --> 01:38:55.327]  Show, I don't know, 14, 15, 16, 17 years after I produced my first film, I thought that we would just go over some more of the things it's doing.
[01:38:55.547 --> 01:38:57.588]  Let's look at this article right here, CBS News.
[01:38:58.089 --> 01:39:03.252]  Bloomberg announces winner of micro apartment design competition.
[01:39:04.175 --> 01:39:23.228]  And you've got these big real estate owners like Bloomberg and others, it's happening in San Francisco and Austin, Texas, not just New York, where, oh, you pay double or triple per square foot what you would have paid for a 2,000 square foot apartment, or a 1,000 square foot apartment, or if you've got a big family, a 3,000 foot condo, you now pay
[01:39:27.503 --> 01:39:34.386]  Effectively, ladies and gentlemen, double or even triple for a 250 square foot, and now they're making them smaller.
[01:39:34.626 --> 01:39:41.970]  They're building one in Austin that will house over 5,000 people, where it's 200 square feet, despite all the studies showing.
[01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:43.931]  It's like elephants in tiny cages.
[01:39:44.331 --> 01:39:45.311]  Not good for you.
[01:39:45.872 --> 01:39:47.732]  So this is all in agenda 21.
[01:39:49.053 --> 01:39:55.555]  To have higher taxes, and to take more of your money, and then to get you to accept less as if it's cool.
[01:39:56.216 --> 01:40:08.100]  And I get the consumerism can be out of control, but these are elites who want red carpets, and Air Force One, and 15 houses, and five wives, and six kids like Ted Turner.
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:17.226]  But you're not supposed to have air conditioning or ever be able to have a car, as Obama famously told Africans earlier this year.
[01:40:17.286 --> 01:40:18.547]  In fact, we'll play that clip now.
[01:40:19.128 --> 01:40:30.496]  Ultimately, if you think about all the youth that everybody's mentioned here in Africa, if everybody's raising living standards to the point where everybody's got a car and everybody's got air conditioning and everybody's got a big house,
[01:40:32.112 --> 01:40:33.652]  Well, the planet will boil over.
[01:40:34.573 --> 01:40:38.694]  Alright, so Bloomberg announces winner of micro-apartments design competition.
[01:40:38.714 --> 01:40:41.134]  This was just a few years ago, now it's going on everywhere.
[01:40:41.534 --> 01:40:44.335]  And this is how they sell it as the newest, coolest thing.
[01:40:44.395 --> 01:40:47.196]  Hey, pay double or triple and live in a coffin house.
[01:40:48.036 --> 01:40:51.437]  For rent, your very own Zen21 shoebox apartment.
[01:40:51.977 --> 01:40:55.258]  Again, this is being reported across the board.
[01:40:55.598 --> 01:40:56.578]  Here's another headline.
[01:40:57.138 --> 01:41:00.139]  Micro-apartments could be hazardous to your mental health.
[01:41:00.990 --> 01:41:30.196]  and then it breaks down uh... the studies showing that it's not good for you to basically live in a jail cell uh... so the elites uh... can control and run your life here's another one living in a box the desperate workers forced to live in a tiny coffin apartments of tokyo which still cost up to four hundred pounds a month or about seven hundred dollars again it's about charging you to live in a coffin style house more it's not about
[01:41:31.206 --> 01:41:35.855]  Cutting back on spoilage or living large.
[01:41:35.875 --> 01:41:39.362]  It's about poor people learning to live even more poor.
[01:41:40.521 --> 01:41:52.768]  And there's more breakdowns here in Austin with the development where they are setting up short-term rentals controlled in a complex that the city is going to run and basically own.
[01:41:53.548 --> 01:42:00.873]  Just very scary to have government like the Communist Chinese getting into the business of these coffin-like facilities.
[01:42:01.733 --> 01:42:04.955]  Moving right along, here's another example of what agenda 21 means.
[01:42:05.535 --> 01:42:08.137]  Western Land Takeover, former BLM chief,
[01:42:09.491 --> 01:42:13.435]  State lawmakers clash as millions of acres are taken out of use.
[01:42:13.816 --> 01:42:22.504]  Case in point, the Bundy Ranch, where you had 35 families, now only 1, because they used the regulations and fees to raise it, to bankrupt you.
[01:42:22.524 --> 01:42:26.829]  Like Obama said, you can build a coal power plant, but we're going to raise the taxes to bankrupt you.
[01:42:27.570 --> 01:42:32.475]  You can have ranches, but we're just going to raise the prices until it bankrupts you, and we wonder why beef prices have doubled.
[01:42:33.727 --> 01:42:36.949]  So, continuing here, here's another article along that line.
[01:42:37.209 --> 01:42:40.431]  BLMI's 90,000 acres of Texas land.
[01:42:40.511 --> 01:42:43.193]  They only, you know, have half the West at hundreds of millions of acres.
[01:42:43.653 --> 01:42:48.055]  Now they want even more of rancher's land that they have the title to.
[01:42:48.716 --> 01:42:54.079]  Sticker shock is steakhouse beef prices highest in 27 years.
[01:42:54.899 --> 01:43:02.304]  So, these are just examples of what living under this system is like.
[01:43:03.064 --> 01:43:11.711]  Now, in conclusion, before we go to these clips from my first film, America Destroyed by Design, let's go to some more of these articles.
[01:43:11.751 --> 01:43:12.472]  Here's Fortune.
[01:43:13.513 --> 01:43:17.296]  June 21, Global Conspiracy or Climate Savior?
[01:43:18.277 --> 01:43:31.708]  And they kind of, you know, make a joke out of it because, again, all the different establishment publications don't want us mobilizing against this corporate stealth takeover of society that's in all the documents in public.
[01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:37.373]  So again, here's that move under Agenda 21 to abolish the suburbs.
[01:43:38.513 --> 01:43:40.015]  Obama, will he abolish them?
[01:43:40.475 --> 01:43:45.159]  Agenda 21 conspiracy to wipe out freedoms of all US citizens.
[01:43:45.219 --> 01:43:48.361]  And it gets into the idea of urban sprawl being horrible.
[01:43:49.281 --> 01:43:51.382]  The problem is we're already laid out to live like that.
[01:43:51.642 --> 01:43:55.164]  We don't want to go into the central cities where everything costs so much.
[01:43:55.684 --> 01:43:59.026]  This will only hurt the poorest people that much more.
[01:43:59.106 --> 01:44:00.767]  This is the model of social engineering.
[01:44:01.268 --> 01:44:02.308]  Here's another headline.
[01:44:02.328 --> 01:44:06.330]  Gen21 GOP candidate vows to stop UN plan.
[01:44:06.670 --> 01:44:10.673]  It's very popular to expose this and to run on a prosperity ticket.
[01:44:10.993 --> 01:44:14.134]  That's why the system doesn't want us talking about it.
[01:44:14.515 --> 01:44:15.135]  Here's another one.
[01:44:15.215 --> 01:44:17.716]  Esquire saying that
[01:44:18.957 --> 01:44:23.240]  It's a con game to try to say that this program's even going on.
[01:44:23.260 --> 01:44:28.022]  Remember how they would try to deny that the UN even basically was trying to set up a world government?
[01:44:28.462 --> 01:44:30.303]  Or they'd try to say there was no NSA spying?
[01:44:30.744 --> 01:44:32.905]  Or there were no lies about WMDs in Iraq?
[01:44:33.245 --> 01:44:35.546]  I mean, the people know that, no, this is going on.
[01:44:35.927 --> 01:44:39.048]  And denying that it exists doesn't work anymore.
[01:44:39.449 --> 01:44:46.673]  In fact, under Agenda 21, they've tried to ban all over the world children learning how to be farmers under their parents and doing their chores.
[01:44:47.253 --> 01:44:47.994]  Here's a headline.
[01:44:48.114 --> 01:44:49.855]  EPA mulls tougher dust standards.
[01:44:50.315 --> 01:44:56.520]  Agency mulls particulate matter standards that would shut down every hay barn in the country.
[01:44:56.780 --> 01:44:58.221]  That's out of the Courier Press.
[01:44:58.942 --> 01:44:59.582]  Here's another one.
[01:44:59.722 --> 01:45:02.724]  Arizona loses to EPA on farm dust.
[01:45:03.125 --> 01:45:05.466]  They're moving ahead to shut it down.
[01:45:06.087 --> 01:45:06.447]  Okay?
[01:45:06.467 --> 01:45:07.308]  Can't have dust.
[01:45:07.768 --> 01:45:10.750]  Obama team wants children banned from doing farm chores.
[01:45:11.431 --> 01:45:11.791]  You see?
[01:45:12.852 --> 01:45:15.334]  This is what's going on under the Department of Labor.
[01:45:17.367 --> 01:45:22.009]  Saying that your children can't even carry out the trash or get the eggs out of the chicken coop.
[01:45:22.389 --> 01:45:23.690]  This is the total control.
[01:45:23.970 --> 01:45:25.670]  This is why they're banning lemonade stands.
[01:45:25.991 --> 01:45:30.412]  And Forbes Magazine has to ask, why is there a war on lemonade stands all over the United States?
[01:45:30.432 --> 01:45:36.995]  It's why they're banning farmers markets and Amish selling milk and why they're raiding organic food stores that aren't Whole Foods and are Mom and Pops.
[01:45:37.595 --> 01:45:39.416]  Because they want you in their system.
[01:45:39.716 --> 01:45:40.817]  They want you at Walmart.
[01:45:41.437 --> 01:45:42.458]  They want you at target.
[01:45:42.498 --> 01:45:48.003]  They want you only buying their tainted, GMO, additive-ridden, social engineering garbage.
[01:45:48.944 --> 01:45:55.371]  And that's why real liberals, real conservatives, real pro-people, pro-prosperity humans need...
[01:45:56.926 --> 01:46:07.756]  To be aware of what's going on and to absolutely say no to this agenda because it is a eugenics, anti-human, neo-feudalistic, fascist program that is on record.
[01:46:07.776 --> 01:46:14.843]  And only your ignorance, only my ignorance and my inaction and your inaction can allow this to continue.
[01:46:15.143 --> 01:46:32.693]  Let's go to a few excerpts of where I tried to warn people at the Grand Canyon and more, and where we show the actual documents and warn of the UN treaties back in 1997, and then we'll come back on the other side in the radio studio to get David Knight's take on this.
[01:46:32.853 --> 01:46:33.474]  Stay with us.
[01:46:34.694 --> 01:46:38.316]  We're here at the model United Nations Day, January 16th, 1998.
[01:46:42.409 --> 01:46:54.000]  We went in and discussed with a lot of people, a lot of issues, and saw the youth being educated, being trained in the ways of world governance and the growth of the world government control apparatus.
[01:46:54.460 --> 01:46:56.282]  And I see y'all are wearing little worlds there.
[01:46:56.322 --> 01:46:57.363]  Do y'all care about the world?
[01:46:57.383 --> 01:46:58.103]  Yeah.
[01:46:58.504 --> 01:46:59.445]  Y'all are good people, aren't you?
[01:46:59.725 --> 01:47:00.966]  Yeah.
[01:47:00.986 --> 01:47:02.327]  Do y'all think the United Nations is helping?
[01:47:02.868 --> 01:47:03.108]  Mm-hmm.
[01:47:03.609 --> 01:47:05.831]  Yeah, I think it's a great way to, like, make world peace.
[01:47:06.661 --> 01:47:07.964]  A great way to make world peace.
[01:47:08.605 --> 01:47:12.713]  Because through global governance, we can knock out all the troublemakers.
[01:47:13.234 --> 01:47:13.414]  Yes.
[01:47:14.055 --> 01:47:15.117]  Is that what y'all been talking about?
[01:47:15.979 --> 01:47:16.520]  Yeah.
[01:47:16.620 --> 01:47:17.041]  Sort of.
[01:47:17.201 --> 01:47:17.342]  Yeah.
[01:47:18.719 --> 01:47:19.380]  Well, that's great.
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:20.701]  I hope y'all have an enjoyable time.
[01:47:20.721 --> 01:47:21.642]  Okay.
[01:47:21.662 --> 01:47:22.102]  Thanks a lot.
[01:47:22.142 --> 01:47:22.522]  Thank you.
[01:47:22.542 --> 01:47:24.184]  What do you think about the United Nations?
[01:47:24.744 --> 01:47:27.506]  It's cool.
[01:47:28.067 --> 01:47:29.168]  It's kind of fun.
[01:47:29.228 --> 01:47:30.449]  It is really cool.
[01:47:30.589 --> 01:47:32.150]  It decides a whole lot of world issues.
[01:47:32.411 --> 01:47:34.392]  World peace and stuff.
[01:47:34.772 --> 01:47:36.594]  It's really exciting.
[01:47:37.275 --> 01:47:37.915]  Nifty.
[01:47:38.395 --> 01:47:40.537]  Model United Nations just won more than many committees.
[01:47:41.418 --> 01:47:44.541]  Helpless young people yielding themselves to the elite's hands.
[01:47:46.522 --> 01:47:47.263]  I could tell them about
[01:47:49.751 --> 01:47:51.812]  The people that really control it but they never understand it.
[01:47:52.793 --> 01:48:00.837]  It's this petty taste of power that gets them to believe that they're really doing something good when they're really working for something bad.
[01:48:03.219 --> 01:48:08.221]  I'm standing here in Northern Arizona overlooking the beautiful Grand Canyon.
[01:48:08.862 --> 01:48:10.963]  One of America's most beautiful treasures.
[01:48:12.501 --> 01:48:30.784]  And it's very distressing to me, and other patriots, and people that truly do care about the environment in America, that Bill Clinton, with his executive order, January 19th, 1996, number 12,986, began the precedent to sign over our national treasures to international control.
[01:48:31.545 --> 01:48:34.825]  Yes, this is a international biosphere and world heritage site.
[01:48:35.585 --> 01:48:37.386]  And guess who controls those?
[01:48:37.986 --> 01:48:38.986]  The United Nations.
[01:48:40.484 --> 01:48:45.807]  The United Nations is nothing more than a front group for international banks based in Europe and in America.
[01:48:46.727 --> 01:48:48.368]  They care nothing about the environment.
[01:48:48.628 --> 01:48:54.011]  They care about using it as an excuse to tell you how you can use the environment.
[01:48:54.251 --> 01:48:59.813]  To get you used to listening to what they say and what you can do and what you can use.
[01:49:00.674 --> 01:49:06.917]  I'm sure y'all have all heard they're planning to restrict cars to the Grand Canyon and bring buses in quite soon.
[01:49:07.457 --> 01:49:09.518]  Well, I'm here during peak season at the end of the summer
[01:49:10.319 --> 01:49:14.142]  And I don't see any problem with Americans coming to the Grand Canyon.
[01:49:14.602 --> 01:49:16.904]  They're paying exorbitant prices of $20 a car.
[01:49:19.346 --> 01:49:24.890]  Wake up and understand that large corporations think in a long-term game.
[01:49:26.271 --> 01:49:34.476]  They understand that if they can restrict use to this place and get international control in here, then 10, 20 years down the road, they can start construction and building.
[01:49:35.197 --> 01:49:36.478]  Which they're already doing, by the way.
[01:49:37.078 --> 01:49:39.240]  So, we are for real conservation.
[01:49:40.003 --> 01:49:58.551]  But we are against organized crime cliques that call themselves international bankers and elite corporations coming in and buying off your politicians like Bill Clinton, who is an incredible traitor to this country, who then signs over promptly our rights to use and to maintain our natural wonders.
[01:50:00.032 --> 01:50:01.993]  There's a lot of money in controlling these places.
[01:50:02.413 --> 01:50:03.653]  A lot of people come and visit them.
[01:50:04.814 --> 01:50:09.616]  Just cut through their lies and it's sterling simple exactly what's happening.
[01:50:10.089 --> 01:50:20.193]  Now let's go talk to some park rangers and other individuals, perhaps some of the tourists here, and see if they've even heard of this terrible crime that's being committed against the American people.
[01:50:20.473 --> 01:50:22.734]  This giant land grab.
[01:50:25.075 --> 01:50:28.657]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm conducting a scientific experiment.
[01:50:29.457 --> 01:50:34.479]  I want to ask y'all if y'all know about executive orders signed January 19th, 1996 by President Bill Clinton
[01:50:36.804 --> 01:50:44.450]  Number 12,986, which designated this as a World Heritage Site under UNESCO, a corporation of the United Nations.
[01:50:45.791 --> 01:50:47.513]  None of you heard about this in the mainstream media?
[01:50:47.533 --> 01:50:49.094]  None of you heard about it?
[01:50:50.555 --> 01:50:51.636]  Nobody's heard about this, have you?
[01:50:51.696 --> 01:50:57.961]  Well, they took down the signs in most parks because there was a furor about three days after they put up the United Nations signs.
[01:50:58.842 --> 01:50:59.683]  No one's heard about it, huh?
[01:51:01.704 --> 01:51:03.406]  Well, see, that's how fascism breeds.
[01:51:04.574 --> 01:51:09.336]  The environmentalist movement is now nothing but an arm of corrupt international banks and corporations.
[01:51:09.616 --> 01:51:13.958]  They're using it as an excuse for land grabs all over the entire world.
[01:51:15.619 --> 01:51:16.879]  Remember this and check it out.
[01:51:16.979 --> 01:51:17.700]  Executive order.
[01:51:17.740 --> 01:51:18.680]  Call the Interior Department.
[01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:19.481]  Call Bruce Babbitt.
[01:51:19.941 --> 01:51:20.621]  Executive order 12,986.
[01:51:21.481 --> 01:51:23.802]  It's important.
[01:51:24.883 --> 01:51:27.084]  The modern bureaus of propaganda keep this from you.
[01:51:30.891 --> 01:51:35.317]  No sooner had I turned away that some of the crowd began to laugh and call me a kook.
[01:51:35.657 --> 01:51:39.482]  I guess they won't take the time to check out the executive order 12,986.
[01:51:39.962 --> 01:51:44.148]  I guess they don't believe it unless they hear it from Peter Jennings' mouth.
[01:51:45.709 --> 01:51:54.072]  At the Grand Canyon Main Visitor Center, we talked to some of the people at the front desk, and they politely said, yes, we've heard about the UN, but we're not quite sure what's going on.
[01:51:54.112 --> 01:51:59.893]  There was some rigamarole, some protest about the UN signs, so they have been moved in some of the national parks.
[01:52:00.514 --> 01:52:04.215]  And then later, we got a little visit from the head honchos, who were quite rude.
[01:52:04.255 --> 01:52:08.456]  Unfortunately, they wouldn't let us take our cameras behind closed doors, where I was threatened with arrest.
[01:52:10.657 --> 01:52:11.537]  Is there anybody that I can
[01:52:12.964 --> 01:52:15.946]  Who will just tell me the same thing you did, but just where I can have a mic on and things?
[01:52:16.426 --> 01:52:19.248]  Well, we have a public affairs officer right here.
[01:52:19.968 --> 01:52:23.991]  Well, you heard me just ask him to just politely talk to public affairs officer.
[01:52:24.031 --> 01:52:28.033]  We were sitting down for about 10 minutes with our cameras off and barely got a shot of her.
[01:52:28.073 --> 01:52:29.134]  That's why we had to freeze it.
[01:52:29.154 --> 01:52:30.595]  We only got about a half a second of her.
[01:52:31.395 --> 01:52:35.878]  She was very rude and drug me in the back and threatened to arrest me for dare to ask questions.
[01:52:35.938 --> 01:52:37.279]  Was I some type of terrorist?
[01:52:37.959 --> 01:52:40.281]  And you should have seen the monster they had in the back with us.
[01:52:40.981 --> 01:52:42.142]  This is all part of America.
[01:52:43.015 --> 01:52:43.855]  It's flat-out corruption.
[01:52:45.796 --> 01:52:47.477]  You own and control these public lands.
[01:52:48.857 --> 01:52:53.719]  Not the federal government, and not their international lackey friends controlled by foreign corrupt banks.
[01:52:54.420 --> 01:52:54.920]  End of story.
[01:52:56.966 --> 01:53:01.669]  We've now reached the north entrance of Yellowstone National Park here in Montana.
[01:53:02.009 --> 01:53:06.132]  And let's just read what the important inscription at the front of this old gate reads.
[01:53:06.852 --> 01:53:09.274]  For the benefit and the enjoyment of the people.
[01:53:09.474 --> 01:53:14.357]  Created by an act of Congress, March 1st, 1872.
[01:53:15.098 --> 01:53:19.100]  We dropped by the main visitor center and they sent us over to the main administration building.
[01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:22.843]  We simply wanted to ask what's going on with the United Nations and our parks.
[01:53:24.079 --> 01:53:24.559]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:53:24.579 --> 01:53:25.600]  Fine, how are you?
[01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:26.660]  Oh, I saw something that looked just like you.
[01:53:27.201 --> 01:53:35.084]  Uh, we're going all over the country doing independent film, and we're just, we already talked to Bruce Babbitt's office, and we just wanted to ask questions about the Biosphere designation.
[01:53:36.625 --> 01:53:37.306]  You're filming?
[01:53:37.406 --> 01:53:38.986]  Do you have a filming permit?
[01:53:39.447 --> 01:53:40.107]  Oh, there's a permit?
[01:53:40.327 --> 01:53:40.467]  Yes.
[01:53:40.647 --> 01:53:42.568]  I'm here making my own documentary.
[01:53:42.588 --> 01:53:43.669]  Could you turn off your camera?
[01:53:45.723 --> 01:53:57.680]  I just want to reiterate the fact that everyone was very polite at most of the parks, but once you would get to a park and get to the main upper level areas, they were all very rude.
[01:53:57.700 --> 01:53:59.183]  They would tell you to turn the camera off.
[01:53:59.243 --> 01:53:59.763]  We would.
[01:53:59.783 --> 01:54:01.666]  Then they took us to the back and again,
[01:54:02.287 --> 01:54:05.890]  Threatened us with fines for having a camera in the park.
[01:54:05.930 --> 01:54:07.171]  And I said, well, I see cameras everywhere.
[01:54:07.191 --> 01:54:08.772]  And they said, well, you're a professional, aren't you?
[01:54:08.792 --> 01:54:09.893]  And I said, well, not really.
[01:54:09.913 --> 01:54:11.034]  I guess I am.
[01:54:11.535 --> 01:54:13.376]  And then, what kind of weirdos are you?
[01:54:13.436 --> 01:54:15.678]  Got me back in the office, called more of them back there.
[01:54:15.698 --> 01:54:19.822]  I got threatened to be arrested at two places and you just saw how polite I was.
[01:54:20.422 --> 01:54:24.666]  And then they thought that I had a bug hidden on me or something and wouldn't even hardly talk to me back there.
[01:54:24.706 --> 01:54:28.789]  They'd all been advised about dangerous people asking questions.
[01:54:28.829 --> 01:54:30.731]  They acted like a military encampment.
[01:54:31.311 --> 01:54:32.472]  It was very, very strange.
[01:54:32.912 --> 01:54:33.973]  Someone had prepared them.
[01:54:35.054 --> 01:54:38.657]  Despite the administration not being very helpful, we did locate the U.N.
[01:54:38.717 --> 01:54:42.621]  signs, both the International Biosphere and the World Heritage Site.
[01:54:43.181 --> 01:54:43.782]  Y'all are the owners.
[01:54:43.822 --> 01:54:47.905]  I mean, we bought into this whole federal government type deal, and now they're telling us that we can't even use what we supposedly own?
[01:54:48.626 --> 01:54:50.527]  Well, I don't know.
[01:54:50.627 --> 01:54:51.668]  I'd rather... Yeah.
[01:54:53.069 --> 01:54:56.312]  Turns this over to the United Nations, and they got a plaque down at the main central office.
[01:54:57.994 --> 01:54:59.535]  It'd probably be easier just not to think about it.
[01:55:02.332 --> 01:55:03.913]  Scott, are you in the conspiracy theory?
[01:55:04.993 --> 01:55:06.074]  It's not a conspiracy theory.
[01:55:06.094 --> 01:55:07.595]  There's a bronze plaque right up there, ma'am.
[01:55:09.096 --> 01:55:09.896]  You see that right there?
[01:55:10.296 --> 01:55:15.559]  They talk about a Hollywood movie, rather than the bronze plaque in the executive order.
[01:55:16.540 --> 01:55:18.481]  That is what's wrong with America, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:19.041 --> 01:55:27.646]  People have been taught, bred, from a foot tall, absolutely not to care, while they're being raided by the government, which is controlled by corrupt corporations.
[01:55:28.868 --> 01:55:30.390]  When I say that, I mean the top 20.
[01:55:30.930 --> 01:55:33.053]  What people think is rich is a joke in this country.
[01:55:33.413 --> 01:55:35.396]  They think a nice house and a nice car is wealthy.
[01:55:35.656 --> 01:55:38.740]  And that's why it's so easy for the establishment to manipulate people.
[01:55:39.721 --> 01:55:43.165]  You notice the well-informed people would talk to us and knew of the executive orders.
[01:55:43.385 --> 01:55:43.686]  Only a few.
[01:55:43.806 --> 01:55:48.611]  And they're probably the people who've actually done well, economically, because they were able to sift through the lies.
[01:55:49.252 --> 01:55:52.033]  But the rest of America seems to love being conned.
[01:55:52.273 --> 01:55:56.335]  It's like they get into being lied to and they get an incredible thrill out of the whole thing.
[01:55:56.935 --> 01:55:57.895]  That is painful to me.
[01:55:58.215 --> 01:56:00.036]  That's why I'll continue to make these documentaries.
[01:56:00.296 --> 01:56:03.517]  I will continue to rant and rave on the radio about factual information.
[01:56:03.797 --> 01:56:09.940]  And if people don't have the inner strength to rise up to a threat, foreign or domestic, and stand up for U.S.
[01:56:09.980 --> 01:56:12.541]  sovereignty, then I feel really, really sorry for them.
[01:56:12.901 --> 01:56:15.022]  Because that's where we are in America today.
[01:56:15.362 --> 01:56:16.302]  We are under siege.
[01:56:16.322 --> 01:56:18.403]  We're losing our property rights as we speak.
[01:56:24.090 --> 01:56:26.171]  All right, and that report is up on YouTube.
[01:56:26.191 --> 01:56:28.713]  It's Agenda 21 equals death.
[01:56:28.933 --> 01:56:31.495]  I hope you enjoy that flashback to 1998.
[01:56:32.255 --> 01:56:38.340]  That was Alex Jones's first documentary, America Destroyed by Design, 16 years ago.
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:41.742]  He was talking about Agenda 21 and how they're going to roll this out.
[01:56:41.822 --> 01:56:53.870]  This is all about a very, very tiny number of elites controlling everything, going back to a kind of feudal system where we're the serfs and they own everything.
[01:56:54.811 --> 01:56:59.774]  That's what we're talking about when we talk about the 1%, although it's a much smaller number than the 1%.
[01:57:00.274 --> 01:57:03.577]  We're going to be joined in the next hour by Peter Van Buren.
[01:57:04.077 --> 01:57:07.720]  He has a book, The Ghosts of Tom Joad, a story of the 99%.
[01:57:07.980 --> 01:57:16.186]  It's essentially a reimagining of The Grapes of Wrath, where instead of the Great Depression, the setting is mid-20th century America.
[01:57:16.626 --> 01:57:18.928]  Instead of the Dust Bowl, it's the Rust Belt.
[01:57:19.668 --> 01:57:30.375]  And instead of the rapid collapse of the Great Depression, it's going to be about the continual decline of America that we see as we fall into this control by the very few.
[01:57:30.395 --> 01:57:38.340]  Now we're also going to talk to him about the re-escalation of Iraq because the other thing about Peter Van Buren was for 23 years he worked for the State Department.
[01:57:39.204 --> 01:57:42.366]  As part of that job, he was in Iraq.
[01:57:42.406 --> 01:57:48.270]  He also wrote another book, We Met Well, how we lost the hearts and minds of the people in Iraq.
[01:57:48.370 --> 01:57:54.474]  So we're going to talk to him as we see Iraq collapsing back into revolution.
[01:57:55.464 --> 01:58:06.471]  As we see Obama saying that first he's not going to send any troops in, then it's going to be 300 troops, 500 troops, and now on Infowars today we have an article saying that it's going to be 800 troops.
[01:58:06.571 --> 01:58:16.497]  Although we learned a few days ago from an article by Paul Joseph Watson that many people in the military have been told that they are training for redeployment to Iraq, that their entire
[01:58:17.077 --> 01:58:18.838]  Organization is going to be sent over there.
[01:58:18.898 --> 01:58:22.200]  So it's going to be much more than 800 troops.
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:25.102]  This is doubling every couple of days.
[01:58:25.142 --> 01:58:27.524]  So we're going to talk to him about Iraq.
[01:58:27.684 --> 01:58:30.746]  We're going to talk to him about the ghost of Tom Joad.
[01:58:30.766 --> 01:58:32.907]  And of course, that's a central character in the Grapes of Wrath.
[01:58:33.487 --> 01:58:37.350]  I think it was number 12 on the AFI list of top 100 heroes.
[01:58:37.790 --> 01:58:38.210]  Stay with us.
[01:58:38.250 --> 01:58:39.151]  We're going to be right back.
[01:58:52.842 --> 01:58:56.791]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:59:00.248 --> 01:59:04.250]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:59:04.270 --> 01:59:08.391]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:59:08.651 --> 01:59:12.052]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:59:12.313 --> 01:59:15.194]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:59:15.354 --> 01:59:22.757]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:59:22.917 --> 01:59:26.558]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:59:26.778 --> 01:59:31.082]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:59:31.262 --> 01:59:37.187]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:59:37.227 --> 01:59:41.010]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:59:41.170 --> 01:59:43.692]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:59:43.892 --> 01:59:45.253]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:59:45.393 --> 01:59:46.634]  It's time to take action.
[01:59:46.775 --> 01:59:48.496]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:00:03.187 --> 02:00:05.108]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:05.589 --> 02:00:08.351]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.175 --> 02:00:16.815]  Big Brother.
[02:00:17.476 --> 02:00:18.516]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:19.257 --> 02:00:20.338]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:20.998 --> 02:00:21.818]  You want answers?
[02:00:22.599 --> 02:00:23.579]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:24.140 --> 02:00:27.782]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:28.322 --> 02:00:32.385]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:34.266 --> 02:00:35.608]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:35.748 --> 02:00:36.889]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[02:00:37.570 --> 02:00:40.873]  We're going to be talking to Peter Van Buren in the next segment.
[02:00:41.494 --> 02:00:51.725]  Now, this is a man who had 23 years experience at the State Department, and he wrote a book about the failed efforts in Iraq.
[02:00:52.586 --> 02:00:55.708]  How We Lost the Hearts and Minds of Iraq was a subtitle of it.
[02:00:56.368 --> 02:00:58.850]  We Met Well was the main title of that book.
[02:00:58.890 --> 02:01:03.692]  He's now written another book about the difference between the 99% and the 1%.
[02:01:04.173 --> 02:01:09.776]  Essentially going back to the idea of the Grapes of Wrath, but putting it in a different setting.
[02:01:09.796 --> 02:01:14.359]  And so the Dust Bowl, the Rust Belt, he calls it the Ghost of Tom Joe.
[02:01:14.379 --> 02:01:16.100]  And of course that was the central character, the
[02:01:17.409 --> 02:01:34.364]  Henry Fonda character, if you saw the movie, and he's talking about the rapid, not the rapid collapse like the Great Depression, but the continual decline of America into a kind of a world where even a smaller number than the 1% are controlling everything.
[02:01:34.424 --> 02:01:35.105]  We know that that's
[02:01:35.425 --> 02:01:42.747]  We see the massive consolidation not only in banks or insurance companies, in communication companies, we see that everywhere.
[02:01:42.968 --> 02:01:49.910]  There's an article up on Infowars.com right now, profiteering on the banker desk, regulator says the public has no right to details.
[02:01:51.121 --> 02:01:51.601]  J.P.
[02:01:51.662 --> 02:01:58.508]  Morgan could potentially hold upwards of $179 billion of life insurance on their employees.
[02:01:58.548 --> 02:02:09.578]  And of course, it's been kind of an ongoing puzzle as to how many of these bankers who are making so much money just keep jumping out of buildings as if the Great Depression had already hit.
[02:02:10.279 --> 02:02:20.068]  And they say on this story here that as of December the 31st, 2013, JP Morgan held $17.9 billion in bank-owned life insurance assets.
[02:02:20.088 --> 02:02:21.890]  So I think it's $17 billion, maybe not $179.
[02:02:23.271 --> 02:02:28.656]  A dark corner of the insurance market that allows banks to take out life insurance policies on their workers.
[02:02:29.537 --> 02:02:36.080]  And secretly pocket the death benefits and receive generous tax perks subsidized by U.S.
[02:02:36.140 --> 02:02:36.800]  taxpayers.
[02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:37.301]  There you go.
[02:02:37.321 --> 02:02:51.427]  Now if you had a murder mystery, and it is a mystery how these guys, how many of them are committing suicide, if you had a murder mystery and somebody had a 18 billion dollar insurance policy on them, you might consider them to be one of the prime suspects.
[02:02:51.447 --> 02:02:53.428]  But of course that would be a conspiracy theory.
[02:02:54.128 --> 02:03:01.710]  What is not a conspiracy theory is the continually doubling of the number of people that are going to be sent back to Iraq.
[02:03:01.730 --> 02:03:04.270]  It started out as zero, now it's 300, 500.
[02:03:04.351 --> 02:03:13.893]  Now today we have a story up on Infowars.com that 800 are now going to be sent back to Iraq according to the State Department and Obama administration, the Pentagon.
[02:03:14.773 --> 02:03:22.958]  But of course we've had word that a lot of soldiers are being told that their entire unit is being trained to go back to Iraq and to be deployed there.
[02:03:22.978 --> 02:03:28.242]  So we're going to be talking to Peter Van Buren as somebody who spent time in Iraq.
[02:03:28.262 --> 02:03:30.123]  We want to ask him what's going on there.
[02:03:30.683 --> 02:03:31.484]  Get his take on it.
[02:03:31.564 --> 02:03:41.010]  As somebody who spent a great deal of time there trying to essentially create a democracy in the ruins of what the American government had done to that country.
[02:03:41.710 --> 02:03:56.106]  I also want to talk to him about this story that came out on Sunday, showing that Blackwater had, just a couple of weeks before this massacre in 2007, where 17 civilians, including a 9-year-old, were shot and killed.
[02:03:59.469 --> 02:04:11.460]  A State Department investigator was threatened by Blackwater's top manager there and told that he could kill the government's chief investigator and quote, no one could or would do anything about it as we were in Iraq.
[02:04:13.041 --> 02:04:23.188]  And according to this article by James Risen, American embassy officials in Baghdad sided with Blackwater rather than the State Department investigators as the dispute over the probe escalated in August 2007.
[02:04:24.029 --> 02:04:31.033]  The officials told the investigators that they had disrupted the embassy's relationship with a security contractor and ordered them to leave the country.
[02:04:31.894 --> 02:04:33.075]  And Gene C. Richter,
[02:04:34.056 --> 02:04:42.579]  One of the investigators wrote in a memo to the State Department that James Risen got a hold of and said, Blackwater contractors saw themselves as above the law.
[02:04:43.179 --> 02:04:54.382]  Now this is the same James Risen who is now a problem for the Obama administration because the government is trying to imprison him for not giving up his sources.
[02:04:55.143 --> 02:04:56.583]  And he says he's got two choices.
[02:04:56.723 --> 02:04:59.544]  He can give up everything he believes in or he can go to jail.
[02:05:00.347 --> 02:05:03.109]  Will the Obama administration send him to jail or will they back down?
[02:05:03.529 --> 02:05:07.951]  We're going to ask James Risen about Iraq and about how they came after him when he wrote the book.
[02:05:07.971 --> 02:05:08.471]  Stay with us.
[02:05:10.232 --> 02:05:17.316]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:05:17.416 --> 02:05:19.557]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:05:19.757 --> 02:05:24.860]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:30.003]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:05:30.183 --> 02:05:33.266]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:05:33.506 --> 02:05:37.390]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:05:37.590 --> 02:05:41.834]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:05:41.915 --> 02:05:51.964]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:05:52.144 --> 02:05:54.667]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:05:54.847 --> 02:06:02.913]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:06:03.053 --> 02:06:07.015]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:06:10.745 --> 02:06:12.526]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grew.
[02:06:13.047 --> 02:06:20.031]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[02:06:20.471 --> 02:06:30.918]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[02:06:31.319 --> 02:06:40.545]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[02:06:41.265 --> 02:06:44.688]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[02:06:45.329 --> 02:06:48.752]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[02:06:49.112 --> 02:06:50.653]  Experience the new formula.
[02:06:51.154 --> 02:06:53.116]  Experience the ancient purity.
[02:06:53.736 --> 02:06:54.657]  Shield your family.
[02:06:55.077 --> 02:06:56.458]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:06:56.879 --> 02:06:59.481]  Available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:07:00.041 --> 02:07:04.025]  X2 from InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:07:10.017 --> 02:07:11.237]  In the near future.
[02:07:11.518 --> 02:07:15.159]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:07:15.179 --> 02:07:15.659]  Security alert.
[02:07:16.019 --> 02:07:17.019]  Security alert.
[02:07:17.239 --> 02:07:18.980]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:07:19.240 --> 02:07:19.860]  Analysis.
[02:07:20.140 --> 02:07:20.781]  InfoWars.
[02:07:20.841 --> 02:07:22.801]  Building independent media operations.
[02:07:22.821 --> 02:07:27.783]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:07:27.823 --> 02:07:28.763]  Prime Directive.
[02:07:28.863 --> 02:07:30.284]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[02:07:30.404 --> 02:07:33.225]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:07:33.245 --> 02:07:36.326]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:07:36.506 --> 02:07:38.727]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:07:38.787 --> 02:07:39.667]  These people are assassins.
[02:07:39.747 --> 02:07:39.887]  Tom.
[02:08:19.784 --> 02:08:24.567]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:25.408 --> 02:08:29.050]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:29.491 --> 02:08:32.693]  Here's a song from Bruce Springsteen, Ghost of Tom Jones.
[02:08:32.733 --> 02:08:34.494]  We're going to tell you who that is if you don't know.
[02:08:34.634 --> 02:08:35.895]  Listen to these lyrics for a second.
[02:08:51.095 --> 02:08:52.556]  Ghost of Tom Joe.
[02:08:52.596 --> 02:08:58.538]  I said the Ghost of Tom Joe.
[02:08:58.578 --> 02:09:02.940]  That's Bruce Springsteen.
[02:09:14.568 --> 02:09:17.070]  And we're talking to Peter Van Buren.
[02:09:17.151 --> 02:09:18.872]  I said just before him, James Risen.
[02:09:18.952 --> 02:09:22.616]  No, it's Peter Van Buren we're going to be talking to about James Risen's report.
[02:09:23.496 --> 02:09:29.182]  He wrote a book as well, The Ghost of Tom Jode, and we're going to have him talk about that.
[02:09:29.202 --> 02:09:30.523]  Did you catch those lyrics in there?
[02:09:30.563 --> 02:09:31.804]  Those Springsteen lyrics?
[02:09:31.944 --> 02:09:33.165]  Welcome to the New World Order.
[02:09:33.245 --> 02:09:35.668]  Families sleeping in their cars in the Southwest.
[02:09:36.208 --> 02:09:38.750]  No home, no job, no peace, no rest.
[02:09:39.619 --> 02:09:42.561]  That's right, Tom Joe, the ghost of Tom Joe, the story of the 99%.
[02:09:44.263 --> 02:09:44.983]  That's his new book.
[02:09:45.284 --> 02:09:53.610]  I want to talk to him also, before we get to that, Peter Van Buren, I'd like to talk to you about your experience in Iraq, because we see that all coming back.
[02:09:53.650 --> 02:09:55.372]  We see ISIS coming in.
[02:09:56.373 --> 02:09:57.493]  You wrote a book previously.
[02:09:58.254 --> 02:10:06.239]  We met well, and how you lost, even though you tried, you lost the hearts and minds of the people in Iraq after that country was destroyed by our invasion.
[02:10:06.899 --> 02:10:08.761]  What's your take on what's going on there now?
[02:10:08.821 --> 02:10:15.565]  Somebody who's been there, who's been in the embassy there in Baghdad, somebody who worked for the State Department for a couple of decades.
[02:10:16.300 --> 02:10:17.341]  Alex, it's good to be back.
[02:10:17.641 --> 02:10:23.367]  I think that if we were to republish the book today, I would probably change the title to I Told You So.
[02:10:23.388 --> 02:10:25.790]  Yeah, that would be good.
[02:10:25.950 --> 02:10:30.195]  And I take no pleasure in being right in this case.
[02:10:30.931 --> 02:10:45.778]  When I left Iraq in 2010, it was obvious to me that the United States had failed over nine years of occupation to address the most fundamental issues that had pulled Iraq apart after our invasion.
[02:10:46.658 --> 02:10:57.443]  Among those issues, the most primary of them was to resolve in some way the broad differences between the ethnic groups, the religious groups, the tribal groups in Iraq.
[02:10:58.464 --> 02:11:02.687]  And we'll use the terms Sunni, Shia, and Kurd here in a broad way.
[02:11:03.167 --> 02:11:17.898]  Because I know many of your informed listeners understand that within each of those groups there are subgroups and many folks who identify with the Sunni bloc are actually expressing tribal connections more than religious connections and so on.
[02:11:17.938 --> 02:11:21.320]  But for simplicity's sake, we'll stick with those three terms.
[02:11:22.441 --> 02:11:32.865]  Iraq was never a nation prior to World War I. It was created artificially by the British after the war, as they took apart the Turkish Ottoman Empire.
[02:11:33.445 --> 02:11:38.607]  And the British sort of said, well, let's draw a line here, let's draw a line there, and hope it all works out.
[02:11:39.627 --> 02:11:51.091]  They actually grouped together people that did not get along, did not like each other, did not see themselves as all part of the same country, in this case.
[02:11:51.903 --> 02:11:59.967]  The Sunni group covered a number of borders, mostly overflowing between what's now called Syria and Iraq.
[02:12:00.688 --> 02:12:12.474]  The Kurds imagined themselves an independent people, but their homeland, if you will, crisscrossed borders with Turkey, with Iraq, with Iran, and some other places in the neighborhood.
[02:12:13.283 --> 02:12:20.869]  The Shias saw themselves as a group that crossed the Iraqi border into Iran, but none of this mattered.
[02:12:20.889 --> 02:12:23.411]  Lines were going to be drawn, and off we went.
[02:12:24.031 --> 02:12:36.040]  After periods of relative stability and instability, Saddam Hussein took power, and in his sense, using what clearly were terrible techniques of repression, kept a lid on all this.
[02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:39.303]  Basically brought the groups together enough
[02:12:40.063 --> 02:12:41.984]  that they held as a nation-state.
[02:12:42.064 --> 02:12:46.507]  When somebody got out of line, he used a lot of force to bring them back into line.
[02:12:47.148 --> 02:12:57.474]  It was imperfect, it was horrible, but it worked in the Middle East to maintain what diplomats call a balance of power, an uneasy set of relationships.
[02:12:58.235 --> 02:12:59.336]  That's the history lesson.
[02:13:00.076 --> 02:13:02.698]  Now let's take a look at where we are today.
[02:13:05.370 --> 02:13:08.152]  The Iraq of today is chaos.
[02:13:08.592 --> 02:13:13.155]  The United States tipped over the anthill in 2003 when we did away with Saddam.
[02:13:13.815 --> 02:13:19.838]  We not only took out one bad guy, we actually destroyed civil society in Iraq.
[02:13:19.858 --> 02:13:20.859]  I saw this myself.
[02:13:21.179 --> 02:13:23.941]  There was no electricity, nobody was picking up the garbage.
[02:13:24.441 --> 02:13:35.665]  There were no water, people couldn't even send their kids to school, because the United States threw the teachers out of work, claiming that they were members of Saddam's political party and couldn't be trusted anymore.
[02:13:36.586 --> 02:13:46.049]  Well, it's one thing to kick over an anthill, it's one thing to break stuff, that's relatively easy, it's another thing to try to put something back together.
[02:13:46.710 --> 02:13:49.791]  And when the United States failed to do that, and then simply
[02:13:51.093 --> 02:14:00.325]  Left in 2011, we set the stage for the chaos we're seeing in Iraq played out on our TV screens and on the internet today.
[02:14:01.783 --> 02:14:04.165]  You know, you were there about what time?
[02:14:04.205 --> 02:14:12.112]  Because I was looking at this article that came out on Sunday from James Risen on the New York Times talking about what was going on with Blackwater back in 2007.
[02:14:12.252 --> 02:14:14.073]  What time frame were you there?
[02:14:14.734 --> 02:14:16.696]  I was actually in Iraq between 2007 and 2009, excuse me, and 2010.
[02:14:16.736 --> 02:14:18.737]  But I saw Blackwater or whatever name they were going on at that time.
[02:14:18.757 --> 02:14:19.658]  They changed names an awful lot.
[02:14:28.045 --> 02:14:35.828]  You know, if you're kiting checks or defrauding credit card companies or running away from an ex-spouse, you know, you've got to keep on the move and change names.
[02:14:35.928 --> 02:14:36.348]  That's right.
[02:14:36.789 --> 02:14:38.749]  And I forget what they were named.
[02:14:38.769 --> 02:14:41.810]  We'll call them John Smith during the time I was there.
[02:14:43.516 --> 02:14:50.601]  You know, the thing about James Risen's article is how, first of all, surprising it is in terms of detail.
[02:14:51.522 --> 02:14:59.768]  As your listeners certainly know, the State Department investigators who went out to look into what Blackwater was doing were threatened with murder.
[02:14:59.949 --> 02:15:02.791]  Their very lives were threatened if they continued the investigation.
[02:15:04.023 --> 02:15:14.818]  And while those details are shocking and almost terrifying, given how much money, over a billion dollars of taxpayer money was spent to support Blackwater,
[02:15:15.888 --> 02:15:20.449]  The broader strokes of the article were familiar to anyone who had served in Iraq.
[02:15:21.329 --> 02:15:22.369]  We saw these guys.
[02:15:22.829 --> 02:15:25.310]  I was lucky enough to be embedded with the U.S.
[02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:25.890]  military.
[02:15:26.430 --> 02:15:38.413]  And as such, my security was dependent on soldiers who were professionals, who understood what they needed to do in order to protect themselves, to protect me, to do their jobs.
[02:15:39.393 --> 02:15:40.133]  And I was very lucky.
[02:15:40.453 --> 02:15:45.698]  Whenever I visited the embassy or worked with people from the embassy, we saw Blackwater.
[02:15:45.899 --> 02:15:51.504]  And as I said in my book, we meant, well, these guys were basically a frat house with guns.
[02:15:53.206 --> 02:15:54.287]  That's a great way of describing it.
[02:15:54.307 --> 02:16:00.193]  You're talking about these different tribes, the Kurds, the Sunnis, the Shiites, and a lot of people...
[02:16:01.627 --> 02:16:02.708]  Who have a biblical background.
[02:16:02.728 --> 02:16:05.649]  They might recognize them as like the Medes, the Persians, the Babylonians.
[02:16:06.489 --> 02:16:27.860]  I think that these borders, these boundaries that were set up by the British Empire when they went in there, separating these different groups into different territories and not really setting the boundaries as to where the tribes live, but then putting some tribes, collecting them together into Iraq or to Iran or putting part of them into both of those countries or into Turkey in the case of the Kurds.
[02:16:28.420 --> 02:16:50.447]  I think that was deliberate to kind of divide and conquer these people so it's not really surprising but you know we put this other tribe in there this mercenary tribe called Blackwater which it was just like you said like a you know frat house with guns and a bull in a china shop and the attitude that they had given a billion dollars that they could they could kill anybody that they want and right after this
[02:16:51.767 --> 02:16:55.450]  Incident there with the investigators, they in fact did kill whoever they wanted.
[02:16:55.510 --> 02:17:09.420]  I mean, they're talking about in terms of details here, they're saying that American personnel were, these Blackwater personnel were known for their swagger, their recklessness, running cars off the road, shooting wildly in the streets, even killing civilians.
[02:17:09.500 --> 02:17:11.441]  I mean, that's the kind of stuff these guys were doing.
[02:17:11.461 --> 02:17:16.685]  That's why I guess the State Department investigators were there, and they got told that, hey, we'll kill you if we wish.
[02:17:17.489 --> 02:17:24.773]  Let me give you some examples of Blackwater swagger that I saw or experienced firsthand.
[02:17:25.834 --> 02:17:30.476]  Blackwater guys, the soldiers, would work out in the gym constantly.
[02:17:30.516 --> 02:17:33.778]  That was pretty much one of the few things you had to do in your spare time.
[02:17:34.418 --> 02:17:40.742]  And even though they worked out all the time and ate the same food as the Blackwater people, they got strong.
[02:17:41.622 --> 02:17:43.563]  But they didn't get crazy.
[02:17:43.763 --> 02:17:46.225]  The Blackwater guys were roided out.
[02:17:46.505 --> 02:17:55.870]  It was obvious to anyone who had ever hung around a gym that the difference between the guys who pumped iron honestly and clean and the guys who were taking steroids.
[02:17:56.391 --> 02:17:58.612]  The Blackwater folks were popping veins.
[02:17:58.792 --> 02:18:00.773]  They were screaming.
[02:18:00.913 --> 02:18:02.154]  They were running amok.
[02:18:02.794 --> 02:18:07.017]  It was obvious that they were eating steroids like candy.
[02:18:07.817 --> 02:18:13.161]  The other thing the Blackwater people did is they were legendary for the parties that they held.
[02:18:13.241 --> 02:18:17.624]  These were Roman orgies, which is an insult to Romans, practically.
[02:18:18.284 --> 02:18:22.667]  The thing is, you had to be either a very connected embassy male
[02:18:23.470 --> 02:18:33.100]  To get invited to these things, meaning you were one of the people who helped oversee the Blackwater contracts, or you had to be any type of female whatsoever.
[02:18:34.081 --> 02:18:38.426]  And the stories that came out of these parties were incredible.
[02:18:38.506 --> 02:18:42.590]  People dancing naked on the bars, rifles being fired off.
[02:18:43.311 --> 02:18:49.117]  People passed out drunk, ambulances being called to haul off people with alcohol poisoning.
[02:18:49.697 --> 02:18:56.524]  Story after story after story, and the next morning the Blackwater guys would be out there all hungover, armed to the teeth.
[02:18:57.906 --> 02:19:06.014]  The soldiers that I work with constantly made fun of them, both for their hair gel and the gold chains they wore out into the field.
[02:19:06.494 --> 02:19:14.063]  Yeah, this clip, this picture that was on the New York Times article, I mean, one of those guys looked like Pierce Brosnan, you know, the guy that's... I mean, it looks really funny.
[02:19:14.344 --> 02:19:15.445]  Except on steroids.
[02:19:16.066 --> 02:19:16.286]  Yes.
[02:19:17.227 --> 02:19:25.397]  But the other thing the soldiers would often talk about, and it wouldn't be with as much laughter, is how little discipline the Blackwater guys had.
[02:19:26.238 --> 02:19:31.442]  They would exercise none of what we call weapons discipline.
[02:19:31.462 --> 02:19:38.508]  The idea would be that when you get a whole bunch of people armed with automatic weapons, one of the things you want to do is make sure you don't shoot each other.
[02:19:39.574 --> 02:19:47.060]  And so, without making a bad joke about some of those parties, accidental discharges were really a critical question.
[02:19:47.100 --> 02:19:49.082]  You didn't want to accidentally shoot somebody.
[02:19:49.122 --> 02:19:52.665]  You didn't want to accidentally point your gun at a friendly.
[02:19:53.205 --> 02:19:56.048]  You wanted to make sure that you were not a danger to others.
[02:19:56.188 --> 02:19:59.670]  The Blackwater guys exercised none of that discipline.
[02:19:59.690 --> 02:20:00.952]  They were dangerous to be around.
[02:20:00.972 --> 02:20:01.652]  No real gun control.
[02:20:01.672 --> 02:20:03.534]  We're going to be right back after the break.
[02:20:03.574 --> 02:20:05.835]  We're going to talk to you a little bit, James, about
[02:20:06.796 --> 02:20:07.458]  Isis.
[02:20:07.498 --> 02:20:08.699]  We had some comments yesterday.
[02:20:08.780 --> 02:20:09.781]  Rand Paul was on Hannity.
[02:20:09.801 --> 02:20:10.642]  I want to get your take on it.
[02:20:10.662 --> 02:20:11.083]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:11.103 --> 02:20:14.388]  How long would you last if all grocery stores ceased to exist?
[02:20:15.479 --> 02:20:16.339]  Not in America.
[02:20:16.379 --> 02:20:17.819]  This can't happen in America.
[02:20:18.180 --> 02:20:21.900]  Because of my concern about our government, I was looking at survival stuff.
[02:20:22.240 --> 02:20:25.321]  I was raised as a Girl Scout, and their motto was to be prepared.
[02:20:25.701 --> 02:20:30.942]  Food for Patriots was an opportunity for me to be able to put some things aside.
[02:20:30.962 --> 02:20:34.882]  I said, well, this is a product worth having, even as it's so good.
[02:20:34.902 --> 02:20:37.443]  I like the pricing for what I got.
[02:20:37.863 --> 02:20:40.023]  I like the containers they were shipped in.
[02:20:40.323 --> 02:20:41.504]  They keep in touch with you.
[02:20:41.524 --> 02:20:42.404]  You get your emails.
[02:20:42.424 --> 02:20:43.804]  You get your confirmations.
[02:20:44.224 --> 02:20:47.446]  The customer service is just absolutely fantastic.
[02:20:48.026 --> 02:20:51.869]  Plan on buying probably about four more of these minimum.
[02:20:51.949 --> 02:20:53.089]  And it just came so quick.
[02:20:53.169 --> 02:20:54.690]  It came right when they said it would come.
[02:20:54.770 --> 02:21:00.314]  Thanks for supplying all this stuff for us, because I think we're all going to be needing it in a very short time.

[02:22:09.767 --> 02:22:11.088]  A sudden change in the wind
[02:22:11.628 --> 02:22:17.609]  The day grows dark as ominous clouds move in and lightning begins to carve arcs in the sky.
[02:22:17.629 --> 02:22:20.850]  And you realize you are not prepared.
[02:22:22.530 --> 02:22:26.291]  The number of intense storms is increasing exponentially in the U.S.
[02:22:26.591 --> 02:22:32.392]  Tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding and droughts are happening with greater magnitude and frequency.
[02:22:32.652 --> 02:22:35.313]  If you are choosing to rely on the government to save you,
[02:22:35.413 --> 02:22:36.813]  And no one's coming to help them.
[02:22:36.973 --> 02:22:38.294]  You could be dead wrong.
[02:22:38.594 --> 02:22:43.675]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster is a visit to mypatriotsupply.com.

[02:23:09.430 --> 02:23:10.531]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:23:10.611 --> 02:23:14.935]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:23:15.095 --> 02:23:20.740]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[02:23:20.820 --> 02:23:24.103]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:23:24.383 --> 02:23:26.945]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:27.045 --> 02:23:31.869]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:23:32.010 --> 02:23:32.770]  Call 800-686-2237.

[02:24:07.876 --> 02:24:08.196]  Go now.
[02:24:23.030 --> 02:24:24.351]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:24.451 --> 02:24:29.353]  I'm David Knight, and I'm talking to Peter Van Buren, a long-time State Department diplomat.
[02:24:30.013 --> 02:24:31.534]  He wrote a book on his experience.
[02:24:31.714 --> 02:24:33.134]  He said, uh, we meant well.
[02:24:33.374 --> 02:24:36.516]  How we lost, though, the hearts and minds of the people of Iraq.
[02:24:37.313 --> 02:24:41.237]  And as Peter was saying earlier, he would retitle it, I Told You So.
[02:24:41.297 --> 02:24:53.310]  One of the things that we've been telling people is that the funding of rebels in Syria by the US government was going to have destabilizing, to put it mildly, effects.
[02:24:54.144 --> 02:24:57.585]  Rand Paul was just on Hannity last night and he talks about this.
[02:24:57.665 --> 02:25:01.086]  I wanted to get Peter's take on this.
[02:25:01.126 --> 02:25:02.527]  Sorry Peter to call you James Risen.
[02:25:02.567 --> 02:25:09.609]  We've been talking about this James Risen revelation about Blackwater and how they threatened even State Department officials.
[02:25:09.629 --> 02:25:12.310]  There's so much I've called you James twice here.
[02:25:12.330 --> 02:25:15.991]  But it's Peter Van Buren and we're going to talk to him after this segment.
[02:25:16.571 --> 02:25:20.574]  About the new book that he has, Ghosts of Tom Joe, the story of the 99%.
[02:25:20.895 --> 02:25:26.019]  I'm anxious to get to that, but I want to finish up on a rock since you had so much experience there.
[02:25:26.579 --> 02:25:31.323]  And I wanted to get your take on this clip from the Sean Hannity Show last night with Rand Paul.
[02:25:31.343 --> 02:25:32.064]  Let's play that clip.
[02:25:32.364 --> 02:25:39.767]  There's a lot of reasons why, you know, these radical Sunni groups that are associated with Al-Qaeda, this ISIS group, why they've become stronger.
[02:25:39.867 --> 02:25:43.908]  But one of the reasons they're stronger is that we have been allied with them in Syria.
[02:25:43.948 --> 02:25:46.949]  We've been funding Islamic rebels who kill Christians.
[02:25:46.989 --> 02:25:51.130]  We've been funding Islamic rebels to fight against Iranian proxies in Syria.
[02:25:51.250 --> 02:25:55.032]  But now we're on the other side of the world and we would be siding with the Iranian guard.
[02:25:55.132 --> 02:25:57.473]  If we were actually to put troops in, they'd be fighting the Iranian guard.
[02:25:57.493 --> 02:25:58.713]  No, I'm not saying that at all.
[02:25:59.434 --> 02:26:07.157]  Yeah, and Hannity then tries to spin this back into a shell game, as Kurt Nemo puts it in his article, where we've embedded that clip.
[02:26:07.197 --> 02:26:13.380]  He says, blaming that Obama and the Democrats are the ones who really created this situation.
[02:26:13.640 --> 02:26:16.301]  What's your take on this, on our involvement with ISIS?
[02:26:16.843 --> 02:26:26.386]  Well, it's clear to me that the United States' foreign policy is based on a completely failed theory, and I think Rand Paul gets at this.
[02:26:26.446 --> 02:26:31.007]  The United States, as a diplomat for 24 years, I saw this firsthand.
[02:26:31.047 --> 02:26:42.831]  The United States has this fantasy image that the world is a series of chessboards, and the chessboard labeled Syria, and there's one next to it labeled Iraq, and another one labeled Iran, and so forth.
[02:26:43.331 --> 02:26:49.977]  And that we can make moves on one of those boards which somehow don't affect what happens on the other chess boards.
[02:26:50.838 --> 02:26:56.603]  Now, of course, in reality this world is extremely complicated, particularly when you get into the Middle East.
[02:26:57.144 --> 02:26:58.525]  As we talked about earlier in the hour,
[02:27:00.109 --> 02:27:03.490]  The borders in the Middle East are artificial.
[02:27:03.550 --> 02:27:12.112]  They do not represent where the actual tribal religious lines of unity actually lie.
[02:27:12.732 --> 02:27:17.894]  The United States has found itself through a series of short-term thinking
[02:27:18.855 --> 02:27:37.797]  Funding rebels in Syria who are now fighting against the government that the United States is supporting in Iraq, which itself is supported by Iran, who the United States is opposing for its nuclear program.
[02:27:39.235 --> 02:27:54.101]  And in fact, the 800 American troops and counting, along with their helicopters and drones and aircraft, are in a position where we're going to be in a supporting role to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, supporting
[02:27:54.981 --> 02:27:57.424]  The Shia Maliki government in Iraq.
[02:27:57.864 --> 02:28:07.094]  Let me get your reaction to what Wesley Clark said years ago when he said there was a plan to go after one country after the other, talked about Libya, Syria, then go into Iran and that sort of thing.
[02:28:08.255 --> 02:28:09.337]  Do you believe that's the case?
[02:28:09.377 --> 02:28:11.959]  Do you believe that it's the case as we've been told by
[02:28:13.340 --> 02:28:28.227]  Some in the intelligence and military community that Benghazi was an effort to supply these rebels so that we could overthrow these governments so that we could maintain a constant state of chaos and war in that area in order to control it.
[02:28:29.158 --> 02:28:30.719]  There's a number of things tangled up in there.
[02:28:30.739 --> 02:28:33.680]  First of all, General Clark is absolutely correct.
[02:28:34.360 --> 02:28:41.343]  There was a plan in 2003 to topple country after country in the Middle East.
[02:28:41.823 --> 02:28:43.684]  Iraq was supposed to be the first one.
[02:28:43.724 --> 02:28:44.745]  It was supposed to be quick.
[02:28:45.565 --> 02:28:50.047]  And the troops were supposed to then turn west into Syria.
[02:28:50.726 --> 02:28:58.573]  meet up with uh... the israelis in lebanon and and basically in a matter of months maybe a little longer
[02:28:59.989 --> 02:29:01.950]  Create a Middle Eastern quick fix.
[02:29:02.430 --> 02:29:06.932]  The Iranians were expected to basically sue for peace, cut a deal.
[02:29:07.572 --> 02:29:15.415]  They had found, they would have found themselves at that time with the American army on their western border in Iraq and the American army on their eastern border in Afghanistan.
[02:29:15.975 --> 02:29:18.556]  That was 2003 and that was the plan.
[02:29:18.836 --> 02:29:20.997]  Unfortunately, it unraveled pretty quickly.
[02:29:22.415 --> 02:29:27.897]  In Libya, when the United States interceded there, we basically repeated the same mistakes as Iraq.
[02:29:27.977 --> 02:29:34.419]  We tackled and toppled a strongman, Qaddafi in that case, without any plan to replace him.
[02:29:35.239 --> 02:29:48.543]  Many people believe that what was happening in Benghazi was an attempt by the United States to gather up as many weapons from Libya as possible, particularly shoulder-fired anti-aircraft
[02:29:49.023 --> 02:29:49.643]  Uh, weapons.
[02:29:49.743 --> 02:29:51.544]  Hang on, we're going to have to pick this up on the other side of the break.
[02:29:51.564 --> 02:29:52.705]  We've got a hard break coming up.
[02:29:52.865 --> 02:29:54.406]  We're talking to Peter Van Buren.
[02:29:54.426 --> 02:29:59.188]  We're going to be talking to him about his diplomatic experience in Iraq, as well as his new book.
[02:29:59.208 --> 02:29:59.588]  Stay with us.
[02:29:59.608 --> 02:30:00.388]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.868 --> 02:30:02.469]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.410 --> 02:30:06.091]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.362 --> 02:30:15.103]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[02:30:15.343 --> 02:30:18.444]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[02:30:18.684 --> 02:30:20.505]  She's just not the woman I married.
[02:30:20.785 --> 02:30:22.725]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[02:30:22.945 --> 02:30:24.405]  Does this seem familiar?
[02:30:24.586 --> 02:30:27.646]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[02:30:27.926 --> 02:30:29.247]  If so, consider this.
[02:30:29.507 --> 02:30:38.429]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[02:30:38.789 --> 02:30:44.817]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.
[02:30:45.178 --> 02:30:46.800]  Forget synthetic chemicals.
[02:30:47.220 --> 02:30:54.871]  Super Female Vitality brings forward key herbs specifically chosen for women's biology without the use of phony additives.

[02:31:08.442 --> 02:31:09.483]  Live life healthy.
[02:31:09.503 --> 02:31:14.127]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:31:14.167 --> 02:31:18.210]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:31:18.490 --> 02:31:21.912]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:31:22.152 --> 02:31:25.054]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:31:25.194 --> 02:31:32.559]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins of heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:31:32.779 --> 02:31:36.401]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:31:36.681 --> 02:31:40.923]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:31:41.103 --> 02:31:47.027]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:31:47.067 --> 02:31:50.849]  Fluoride, it's in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:31:51.009 --> 02:31:53.550]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:31:53.750 --> 02:31:55.111]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:31:55.251 --> 02:31:56.492]  It's time to take action.
[02:31:56.632 --> 02:31:58.333]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:32:10.020 --> 02:32:17.086]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:32:17.186 --> 02:32:19.347]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:32:19.547 --> 02:32:24.651]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:32:24.811 --> 02:32:29.755]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:32:29.975 --> 02:32:33.036]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:32:33.296 --> 02:32:37.158]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:32:37.378 --> 02:32:41.620]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:32:41.700 --> 02:32:51.704]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:32:51.924 --> 02:32:54.445]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:32:54.765 --> 02:32:56.585]  SAC, this is Crystal Palace.
[02:32:56.645 --> 02:32:56.745]  Inc.
[02:32:56.765 --> 02:32:59.046]  NORAD has declared DEFCON 3 Scramble Alert Aircraft.
[02:32:59.106 --> 02:33:00.446]  I repeat, Scramble Alert Aircraft.
[02:33:19.721 --> 02:33:23.702]  The Whopper spends all its time thinking about World War III.
[02:33:24.202 --> 02:33:25.662]  Target selection complete.
[02:33:25.722 --> 02:33:27.562]  Time-on-target sequence complete.
[02:33:28.362 --> 02:33:34.464]  22 Typhoon-class submarines departing Petropavlovsk, turning southbound at Nordkapp, bearing 095 degrees.
[02:33:34.744 --> 02:33:40.084]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan Air Defense Zone.
[02:33:40.625 --> 02:33:46.966]  From the front lines of the Information War... Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode.
[02:33:47.066 --> 02:33:48.406]  We are at DEFCON 1.
[02:33:50.835 --> 02:33:53.077]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[02:33:53.097 --> 02:33:53.757]  You bet!
[02:33:54.218 --> 02:33:58.381]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:33:58.541 --> 02:34:01.483]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[02:34:01.503 --> 02:34:05.306]  3... 2... 1... Impact!
[02:34:06.947 --> 02:34:08.848]  Shall we play a game?
[02:34:09.068 --> 02:34:09.649]  How about...
[02:34:14.947 --> 02:34:19.449]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:34:19.789 --> 02:34:21.790]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready.
[02:34:22.070 --> 02:34:22.931]  Awaiting launch codes.
[02:34:23.671 --> 02:34:24.832]  We are on a launch mode.
[02:34:25.292 --> 02:34:28.873]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[02:34:29.213 --> 02:34:33.135]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:34:33.595 --> 02:34:33.936]  We're in!
[02:34:35.096 --> 02:34:36.397]  Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[02:34:36.877 --> 02:34:38.958]  We have Soviet submarine launch detection.
[02:34:39.398 --> 02:34:41.041]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[02:34:41.441 --> 02:34:42.903]  I wish I was like everybody else.
[02:34:42.923 --> 02:34:44.325]  Strange end.
[02:34:45.006 --> 02:34:47.951]  The only winning goal is not to play.
[02:34:57.102 --> 02:35:08.691]  And as we see the escalation of the Cold War, as we see it being brought back with events in the Ukraine and the administration pushing there, we also see the re-escalation of Iraq.
[02:35:08.712 --> 02:35:13.676]  And we've been talking to Peter Van Buren, a man who is a 24-year veteran of the State Department.
[02:35:14.036 --> 02:35:15.237]  He spent a year in Iraq.
[02:35:15.297 --> 02:35:19.981]  He wrote a book on it when he came back, How I Helped Lose the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of the Iraqi People.
[02:35:20.601 --> 02:35:24.706]  The title was We Met Well and his website is wemetwell.com.
[02:35:24.726 --> 02:35:34.996]  We were talking just before the break and I want to get back to that about Rand Paul's comments last night on Sean Hannity saying that one of the reasons that ISIS is stronger...
[02:35:35.917 --> 02:35:40.340]  is that we've been allied with them in Syria and we've been funding Islamic rebels.
[02:35:40.420 --> 02:35:54.748]  But before I do, Peter, let me remind our listeners that this hour is brought to them by MyPatriotSupply and of course with the unrest that we see, the collapse of the border with soaring meat prices, it's clear that there is no longer time to wait.
[02:35:54.808 --> 02:35:56.249]  You need to start getting prepared today.
[02:35:56.269 --> 02:36:01.872]  Get on over to MyPatriotSupply.com and check out their complete line of preparedness products.
[02:36:02.512 --> 02:36:06.633]  My Patriot Supply is the home of the Patriot Pantry line of emergency food storage.
[02:36:07.214 --> 02:36:10.495]  If you don't have food, you're no threat to the New World Order.
[02:36:10.555 --> 02:36:17.857]  They're counting on you to be ever-dependent slaves to their system of control, but you can fight back and establish independence for you and your family.
[02:36:18.317 --> 02:36:21.058]  By securing your own private supply of storable food.
[02:36:21.498 --> 02:36:24.279]  There's no better way to prepare than this Patriot-owned company.

[02:36:34.442 --> 02:36:38.643]  That website again is MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex.
[02:36:39.423 --> 02:36:47.706]  And as I was just saying, Peter, talking about the New World Order and we look at the lyrics we came in just in the first segment when you came in with us.
[02:36:47.726 --> 02:36:52.708]  We're playing Bruce Springsteen's song about the ghost of Tom Joad.
[02:36:53.149 --> 02:36:56.690]  That's the title of your book, The Ghost of Tom Joad, a story of the 99%.
[02:36:56.770 --> 02:36:57.370]  And in that he says,
[02:36:59.031 --> 02:37:00.372]  Welcome to the New World Order.
[02:37:00.872 --> 02:37:03.213]  Families sleeping in their cars in the Southwest.
[02:37:03.273 --> 02:37:05.334]  No home, no job, no peace, no rest.
[02:37:05.854 --> 02:37:10.136]  I want to get to that, but you were just starting to talk about what had happened in Libya.
[02:37:10.156 --> 02:37:23.382]  And of course we've been told by Steve Pchenik and others that in their opinion what was happening was something of an internecine warfare between the CIA, one group trying to stop the other group from arming terrorists that they were going to use as surrogates.
[02:37:23.422 --> 02:37:25.903]  What's your take on what happened in Libya?
[02:37:26.703 --> 02:37:34.270]  A lot of people believe that the American facility in Benghazi, and we do need to stop calling it a consulate.
[02:37:34.330 --> 02:37:36.832]  It was not a State Department consulate.
[02:37:36.892 --> 02:37:38.073]  It was a U.S.
[02:37:38.113 --> 02:37:46.261]  government facility that appeared to be staffed primarily by CIA and so-called ex-military contractors, if you will.
[02:37:46.881 --> 02:38:00.204]  And many people believe that one of their most important jobs there was gathering up weapons off the Libyan battlefield, primarily shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles, and transshipping those to Syria.
[02:38:01.024 --> 02:38:10.286]  It's important, if you're the United States and you're trying to supply weapons to bad guys, that your fingerprints are not obviously on them.
[02:38:10.826 --> 02:38:20.718]  And so there's no easier way to do that than to pick up weapons in one part of the Middle East, put them on a third country ship, and send them off to another part of the Middle East.
[02:38:21.078 --> 02:38:24.782]  And it's very possible that was what was going on in Benghazi.
[02:38:25.503 --> 02:38:40.771]  But regardless, it's critical to understand that the United States has been supporting the Sunni rebels, insurgents, gangsters, thugs, whatever word you want to apply, in Syria, as have our purported allies in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
[02:38:41.491 --> 02:38:55.912]  The fact that these thugs have decided now to stick with their more deeply felt allegiances to their brothers in Iraq instead of fighting America's proxy war in Syria should surprise absolutely no one.
[02:38:56.892 --> 02:39:06.362]  That's right, and it's the same people that are essentially pushing these endless wars, I believe, that are the 1% of the 1%.
[02:39:06.422 --> 02:39:11.267]  Tell us now, I want to move on to your new book, The Ghosts of Tom Joad, a story of the 99%.
[02:39:12.889 --> 02:39:13.810]  Tell us about that book.
[02:39:14.070 --> 02:39:15.792]  Tell us what you're talking about there.
[02:39:16.260 --> 02:39:23.527]  Ghosts of Tom Jode is a look at the last 50 years of American life.
[02:39:24.448 --> 02:39:36.539]  It starts out right after World War II, when people were able to come home from the wars, to have jobs waiting for them, when there were union jobs, factory jobs, jobs for white-collar people.
[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:38.421]  There were jobs for everyone.
[02:39:38.601 --> 02:39:48.043]  And it was possible by working hard to support your family, better yourself, maybe look forward to a better life for your kids than you had.
[02:39:49.062 --> 02:40:10.840]  That life in America stood for 30-some years until the middle of the 1970s, when some political decisions and some insights from America's corporate leaders, that basically they could make as much money or more making things overseas as they could here in the United States, changed the way our life works.
[02:40:11.861 --> 02:40:22.306]  Up until 1973, the growth curves of the rich and the middle class rose about the same percentages, about 6% for each.
[02:40:22.366 --> 02:40:28.189]  The rich obviously got richer, but the middle class also saw their wealth and their wages rise.
[02:40:29.030 --> 02:40:31.571]  We went over the top of that hill in the mid-1970s, and since then,
[02:40:33.852 --> 02:40:41.832]  The amount of money and with it the amount of control that a very small number of Americans, the 1% have, has gone skyrocketing.
[02:40:42.699 --> 02:40:48.602]  While the amount of money and wealth and thus power the middle class has has fallen dramatically.
[02:40:49.042 --> 02:40:55.606]  The Ghost of Tom Joe tells that story with some detail but more in the sense of a human scale.
[02:40:55.746 --> 02:40:59.708]  There's plenty of great books about economics out there with lots of math in them.
[02:41:00.308 --> 02:41:01.749]  My book doesn't have any numbers.
[02:41:01.889 --> 02:41:04.230]  It doesn't have any math or any formulas in it.
[02:41:04.810 --> 02:41:06.131]  It's about people.
[02:41:06.651 --> 02:41:07.272]  It's about us.
[02:41:08.297 --> 02:41:18.023]  It's about the lives we lead, the country that we had, and the hopes that, Dave, we might become better people than what we are now.
[02:41:18.664 --> 02:41:32.153]  I think that was what was so powerful about The Grapes of Wrath, and I'm reminded of, of course that was Steinbeck, I'm reminded of Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises, where a character there was asked, how did he go bankrupt?
[02:41:32.213 --> 02:41:33.714]  And he said, well basically two ways.
[02:41:34.474 --> 02:41:37.136]  First, gradually, then suddenly.
[02:41:37.156 --> 02:41:47.603]  I think we've been going gradually bankrupt in this country and now there's a sense from, I think, everybody in terms of every metric that we see that this is happening suddenly.
[02:41:47.663 --> 02:41:49.164]  This is starting to accelerate.
[02:41:49.184 --> 02:41:51.165]  We're starting to hit the knee of the curve.
[02:41:51.185 --> 02:41:52.506]  We're starting to go exponential.
[02:41:53.007 --> 02:41:56.609]  There's a real dread from people as to what's around the corner.
[02:41:56.669 --> 02:41:58.851]  We've seen what happens with the Rust Belt, but
[02:41:59.471 --> 02:42:03.273]  Do we have a kind of dust bowl depression in our future?
[02:42:03.293 --> 02:42:12.017]  And I think a lot of this, you're talking about, you know, how wealth has come to be consolidated in the hands of a very, very few people.
[02:42:12.537 --> 02:42:17.499]  As we see the consolidation of corporations, we also see the consolidation of governments, don't we?
[02:42:17.539 --> 02:42:18.520]  And things like NAFTA.
[02:42:18.580 --> 02:42:25.023]  Now we have these secret trade agreements, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Trans-Atlantic Partnership being negotiated where these
[02:42:25.683 --> 02:42:33.767]  Large, multinational corporations are essentially going to be given sovereign power on the level of former sovereign states.
[02:42:34.928 --> 02:42:40.631]  What Joseph Tom Joad says is that these things are not by accident.
[02:42:40.731 --> 02:42:44.253]  These aren't the magic of the free markets.
[02:42:44.313 --> 02:42:50.396]  These aren't what we've come to call capitalism doing what it does.
[02:42:50.416 --> 02:42:50.457]  No.
[02:42:51.517 --> 02:43:03.292]  What we're seeing is the result of very conscious decisions by a very few people in Washington, in some corporate executive suites, to try to take it all.
[02:43:04.488 --> 02:43:08.049]  Whereas, there always were rich people and there always were poor people.
[02:43:08.149 --> 02:43:14.792]  For a lot of years in the United States, there was always enough for people in the middle class.
[02:43:14.952 --> 02:43:19.854]  And there was always the promise of maybe a little bit more, particularly if you were willing to work hard.
[02:43:20.554 --> 02:43:22.675]  That has been taken away from us.
[02:43:23.295 --> 02:43:31.118]  We've recreated, instead of the middle class, something your listeners and everyone out there already knows, and that's this thing we call the working poor.
[02:43:31.858 --> 02:43:32.098]  Yes.
[02:43:32.258 --> 02:43:37.921]  About two-thirds of the people who receive food stamps or food benefits are working people.
[02:43:38.722 --> 02:43:41.703]  These aren't welfare queens, as the expression goes.
[02:43:41.723 --> 02:43:47.146]  These aren't people laying on their couch because they're too lazy to work or they don't want to work.
[02:43:47.186 --> 02:43:49.047]  They just want to live off the government.
[02:43:49.768 --> 02:43:50.648]  That isn't the case.
[02:43:50.688 --> 02:43:51.889]  These are working people.
[02:43:52.429 --> 02:43:57.232]  One out of every five children in the United States is in a food insecure situation.
[02:43:58.519 --> 02:44:04.662]  This is us that we're talking about, and we've been placed here by a small group of people who wants it all.
[02:44:05.042 --> 02:44:12.946]  Look, the CEO of Walmart, if you took his yearly salary and divided it into, say, a 50-hour work week, makes over $4,000 an hour.
[02:44:17.270 --> 02:44:28.513]  People there, in your listening area, if they work at Walmart, are hoping to pull down seven or eight dollars an hour, and that's based on the twenty, maybe thirty hours a week they can squeeze out of it.
[02:44:29.273 --> 02:44:30.053]  Lazy people?
[02:44:30.313 --> 02:44:31.013]  I don't think so.
[02:44:31.293 --> 02:44:40.736]  Most of the working people that I know are trying to hold down two, maybe three jobs, hoping to put together enough money to take care of themselves and their family.
[02:44:40.976 --> 02:44:45.037]  All that money's going someplace, and it's going, I'm afraid, straight up.
[02:44:45.816 --> 02:44:52.921]  You know, you're talking about how jobs moved out of this country were exported to China and elsewhere.
[02:44:52.961 --> 02:44:55.883]  Those were manufacturing jobs, essentially, at the beginning.
[02:44:56.604 --> 02:45:03.069]  Now what we're looking at is a future where even service jobs, and we were told that, well, we need to move them
[02:45:03.889 --> 02:45:06.951]  Offshore, because we've got unions that have become too powerful.
[02:45:06.991 --> 02:45:09.513]  These people are getting paid way more than they should be.
[02:45:09.533 --> 02:45:16.438]  And maybe that was true to some degree, that the salaries had been negotiated up to a level that maybe wasn't sustainable.
[02:45:16.879 --> 02:45:17.279]  Whatever.
[02:45:17.339 --> 02:45:18.320]  Now we're seeing
[02:45:18.880 --> 02:45:24.605]  That service jobs are going to be very quickly replaced by automation, by robotics.
[02:45:25.526 --> 02:45:33.933]  We're looking at, within just a few years, I believe, we're going to see the entire transportation industry, that entire service industry, disappear.
[02:45:34.414 --> 02:45:40.199]  There's all these fights going on with taxi drivers and taxi unions with Uber.
[02:45:40.879 --> 02:45:59.164]  And yet the Uber CEO has said that he wants to see a situation in the future, and he is paying drivers at the moment to take people around in competition to the taxi drivers, but he wants to see a future where the dude in the car goes away because that dude in the car is what's making your ride expensive.
[02:45:59.224 --> 02:46:00.384]  And then he goes on to say,
[02:46:01.044 --> 02:46:08.689]  That he envisions a situation where we need to get over the idea that cars are hardware that are privately owned.
[02:46:08.709 --> 02:46:11.671]  We need to see these vehicles as part of the community.
[02:46:12.172 --> 02:46:14.613]  No, they're actually going to be vehicles that he owns.
[02:46:14.674 --> 02:46:17.616]  He's going to be the one who is Uber everything, right?
[02:46:18.076 --> 02:46:26.061]  This is a good example of consolidation, I think, because we're going to see taxi drivers, as well as truck drivers, as well as delivery people.
[02:46:26.202 --> 02:46:29.204]  That's all going to go away with these computer-driven cars.
[02:46:30.124 --> 02:46:31.366]  That's coming in the future.
[02:46:31.706 --> 02:46:37.212]  But tomorrow, and right around the corner, you're going to see even greater losses in minimum wage jobs.
[02:46:37.232 --> 02:46:42.738]  The majority of people who work for minimum wage, or less than minimum wage, are in the food service industry.
[02:46:43.339 --> 02:46:51.387]  And those jobs are being replaced, as we speak, by touch screens, by tablets, by other ways of ordering food that don't involve human beings.
[02:46:52.368 --> 02:46:54.889]  The pattern here should be pretty obvious.
[02:46:55.369 --> 02:47:01.991]  And for the folks who say, well, you know, we couldn't have paid people more and those damn unions ruined all this for us.
[02:47:02.591 --> 02:47:13.255]  You know, after 30 years of union jobs disappearing and people going on food stamps and finding themselves unemployed, I just gotta ask, how'd that work out for us?
[02:47:13.703 --> 02:47:14.944]  Yeah, exactly, yeah.
[02:47:15.545 --> 02:47:31.562]  And I guess really part of the reason that this war has worked initially is that when you go to a place like China and people see an increase in their standard of living, even though their standard of living is still abysmally poor, many people in China were seeing their standard of living going up by 20, 30, 40 percent, and that
[02:47:34.105 --> 02:47:38.408]  Made them feel somewhat happy about that and they felt they were making progress.
[02:47:38.428 --> 02:47:39.249]  Let's put it that way.
[02:47:39.609 --> 02:47:45.293]  Although you do have people committing suicide now in these factories, sewing notes into clothing saying, you know, help us.
[02:47:45.373 --> 02:47:46.855]  I mean, you know, there's that side of it.
[02:47:47.195 --> 02:47:51.458]  But there is also a side of some of these people they believe that they're making economic progress.
[02:47:51.578 --> 02:47:56.861]  However, in America we see just the opposite, and we're going to be seeing that all throughout Western countries.
[02:47:57.142 --> 02:47:58.442]  We're going to be seeing just the opposite.
[02:47:58.463 --> 02:48:07.649]  We're going to be seeing people whose standards of living are being dropped by 20%, 30%, 40%, maybe disappearing altogether as their jobs disappear.
[02:48:08.109 --> 02:48:14.953]  And I think that this, we've thought of this transportation industry thing as being maybe 10 years out, 20 years out.
[02:48:15.354 --> 02:48:18.115]  Now they're talking about, Google is talking about it being 3 to 5 years out.
[02:48:19.136 --> 02:48:27.359]  They were saying at the beginning of the year they had solved, essentially they believe, the technical issues, and we can talk about that, you know, the blue screen of death if your computer crashes.
[02:48:27.839 --> 02:48:32.300]  But, you know, they think that they have solved the technical issues.
[02:48:32.360 --> 02:48:35.881]  So the beginning of the year, they said what was remaining were legal issues.
[02:48:35.941 --> 02:48:40.263]  And about April, we saw the European Union as well as California saying that
[02:48:40.843 --> 02:48:48.131]  Starting in just the next few months, they're going to allow these self-driving cars to be operated without somebody at the wheel, ready to take the wheel.
[02:48:48.172 --> 02:48:54.158]  So they're moving the legal issues out of the way, and they're ready to start rolling this out quite literally.
[02:48:54.799 --> 02:48:58.804]  The patterns are very, very clear for anyone who wants to take a look at them.
[02:48:59.304 --> 02:49:11.754]  You know, it's funny because when I tried to sell this book, Ghosts of Tom Joe, to the publishers in New York City, which is where most of the book publishing industry is located, I couldn't get a foot in the door.
[02:49:12.154 --> 02:49:14.176]  What do you mean there's poor people in America?
[02:49:14.216 --> 02:49:17.779]  What do you mean that there's people somewhere in between New York and L.A.
[02:49:18.219 --> 02:49:22.442]  who are forced to work two or three jobs just to hold a life together?
[02:49:22.883 --> 02:49:23.703]  What are you talking about?
[02:49:23.743 --> 02:49:24.424]  We don't see that.
[02:49:24.464 --> 02:49:25.425]  We don't know anything about that.
[02:49:25.985 --> 02:49:34.909]  The very first publisher I approached outside of New York, a group of people in Indiana, said, we want this book.
[02:49:35.029 --> 02:49:38.370]  We've been waiting for someone to come along and tell these stories.
[02:49:39.290 --> 02:49:43.652]  And I find the very same thing happens now when I speak to people around the country.
[02:49:43.732 --> 02:49:45.593]  I have to kind of check myself.
[02:49:46.353 --> 02:49:53.156]  And when I'm on the East Coast, I'm in Boston or New York talking about this, I find that I have to stop
[02:49:54.296 --> 02:49:56.619]  And explain some of these terms.
[02:49:57.200 --> 02:50:05.869]  And when I speak outside of these big cities, I find that I have to instead say, do you know that people in New York don't know who you are?
[02:50:05.889 --> 02:50:06.650]  Yeah.
[02:50:06.830 --> 02:50:08.291]  And don't know how you live.
[02:50:08.772 --> 02:50:09.513]  And don't care.
[02:50:10.193 --> 02:50:12.156]  And probably really, really don't care.
[02:50:12.256 --> 02:50:24.370]  Politicians will show up in our small towns once every four years, promise new jobs, promise job training, promise to fix things up, wash their hands in Purell, and then get out of town before something sticks to them.
[02:50:24.770 --> 02:50:33.934]  Well we see some politician like Hillary Clinton, for example, talking about the 99% when she has a half a billion dollars given to her foundation by Goldman Sachs.
[02:50:33.954 --> 02:50:36.435]  They're holding fundraisers in Goldman Sachs offices.
[02:50:36.775 --> 02:50:40.817]  She's getting a quarter of a million dollars for a speech at a university and the students are saying,
[02:50:41.317 --> 02:50:42.018]  What's going on?
[02:50:42.058 --> 02:50:42.818]  What's wrong with this?
[02:50:43.278 --> 02:50:45.600]  We're going to be right back with Peter Van Buren.
[02:50:45.700 --> 02:50:48.222]  His book is Ghosts of Tom Joad, a story of the 99%.
[02:50:49.623 --> 02:50:53.265]  And I want to talk to you a little bit more about the setting and the time setting of this book.
[02:50:53.806 --> 02:50:55.667]  And we'll be right back with Peter Van Buren.
[02:50:55.707 --> 02:50:56.107]  Stay with us.

[02:54:17.225 --> 02:54:18.527]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:18.567 --> 02:54:24.454]  I've just been talking to Peter Van Buren, the author of a new book, Ghosts of Tom Joe, the story of the 99%.
[02:54:25.475 --> 02:54:31.502]  And just before we went to the break, I was talking about that phony champion of the 99%, Hillary Clinton.
[02:54:32.123 --> 02:54:34.646]  Peter, you used to work for her at the State Department, didn't you?
[02:54:35.443 --> 02:54:39.626]  I work under her, we'll say.
[02:54:39.946 --> 02:54:46.451]  I worked at a fairly low level at the State Department and for most of my career had little contact with the Secretary of State's office.
[02:54:46.491 --> 02:54:59.680]  However, once I wrote my whistleblowing book, We Meant Well, about the war in Iraq, it was Mrs. Clinton's staff that ran the campaign to push me out of the State Department.
[02:55:00.480 --> 02:55:08.842]  In particular, one of her deputies slash henchmen is a name that many of your listeners either are familiar with or should be familiar with, Pat Kennedy.
[02:55:09.882 --> 02:55:18.043]  Pat Kennedy's name was on the 2007 report from Iraq exonerating Blackwater from any misdealings.
[02:55:18.703 --> 02:55:27.305]  Pat Kennedy was the lead person explaining why Hillary Clinton was not guilty of anything over the Benghazi disaster.
[02:55:27.945 --> 02:55:34.908]  And Pat Kennedy was the person who signed off on all of the attempts to persecute and prosecute me at the Department of State.
[02:55:35.689 --> 02:55:36.589]  He's a bureaucrat.
[02:55:36.709 --> 02:55:49.995]  He's a person that doesn't appear in public very often, but as the Hillary campaign cranks up and the documentaries, Triumph of Hillary's Will, are released, keep an eye out for that name.
[02:55:50.035 --> 02:55:51.736]  You'll be surprised where it pops up.
[02:55:52.156 --> 02:55:59.326]  Yeah, I'll just refer people to that James Risen story that we were talking about from the New York Times on Sunday about Blackwater and what we were talking about in the first part of the interview.
[02:55:59.406 --> 02:56:07.477]  People can check out his credentials and his credibility by learning what really went on with Blackwater in Iraq as that's coming out now.
[02:56:08.718 --> 02:56:10.679]  Peter, tell us a little bit about your book.
[02:56:11.039 --> 02:56:13.599]  Now, you said it starts in the 1950s and goes forward.
[02:56:13.679 --> 02:56:32.565]  It's a fictional account that really is kind of a more of a, it's not an economics text, it's not a political text, you're not going through metrics, you're really going through the kind of visceral experience that people are going through as America is, as I said before, approaching bankruptcy first gradually and then we're afraid maybe now suddenly.
[02:56:32.945 --> 02:56:37.126]  Does it go further into the future from where we are or is it coming up to the present?
[02:56:37.606 --> 02:56:39.468]  It takes us right up till today.
[02:56:39.488 --> 02:56:51.961]  It's fiction in the sense that I've put this story all in one family to make it easier to read and a little more comfortable of a story.
[02:56:52.542 --> 02:56:56.286]  Because economics at the end of the day is not about numbers, it's about people.
[02:56:57.006 --> 02:57:04.788]  And just like my book about Iraq that I lived, this story itself touches my own life and I'm sure the lives of many others.
[02:57:04.848 --> 02:57:07.249]  I grew up in the Rust Belt in Ohio.
[02:57:07.769 --> 02:57:11.630]  I saw firsthand the loss of jobs, the factory closings.
[02:57:12.910 --> 02:57:18.292]  I was able to leave that area and get a job with the State Department, but when I came back,
[02:57:19.012 --> 02:57:27.599]  As a 54-year-old out of work at the State Department, I went back into the minimum wage economy and saw firsthand how this is all working now.
[02:57:27.819 --> 02:57:36.606]  I spoke with an endless number of people who were in the same situation, and then went back to the Midwest and spent most of the summer traveling there, talking with folks.
[02:57:37.247 --> 02:57:54.057]  I spent some time living out of my car and came to understand what was happening to our own selves, our own people, Americans, who were abandoned by their government, who were left aside by a very few hyper-wealthy people.
[02:57:54.697 --> 02:58:02.159]  Who saw them not as human beings, but essentially the same way that people would look at animals, or cattle, or farm animals.
[02:58:03.080 --> 02:58:09.862]  A quantity that needed to be kept fed for what they were going to do and then when they were no longer necessary, pushed aside.
[02:58:10.242 --> 02:58:16.063]  Yes, it was just Senator Jeff Sessions just recently said, you're treating people like commodities.
[02:58:16.604 --> 02:58:18.484]  And that's essentially what you're saying.
[02:58:18.904 --> 02:58:24.726]  I'm reminded you're talking about how difficult it was for you after your experiences of being pushed out of the State Department.
[02:58:24.806 --> 02:58:31.207]  I'm reminded of Thomas Drake who wound up blowing the whistle at the NSA and then becoming an Apple genius to try to make ends meet.
[02:58:31.487 --> 02:58:34.988]  Again, that book is The Ghost of Tom Joe, the story of the 99%.
[02:58:35.428 --> 02:58:38.489]  Peter Van Buren, go to his website, wemetwell.com.
[02:58:39.409 --> 02:58:41.190]  Alex Jones will be with us tomorrow.
