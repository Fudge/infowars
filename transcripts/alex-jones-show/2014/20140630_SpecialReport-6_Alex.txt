[00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:13.450]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached a historic crossroads.
[00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.392]  The globalists are collapsing our republic right now in front of our very eyes.
[00:00:19.872 --> 00:00:25.114]  They are destroying national sovereignty to bring us into the North American Union.
[00:00:25.894 --> 00:00:47.757]  Crony capitalists that have created the planetary corporate system that we know as the New World Order have been very open about the fact that they want a homogenized, dumbed-down, poor global population that can be exploited for their labor and who will be very pliable in the social engineer's hands.
[00:00:48.803 --> 00:00:57.209]  And we have seen illegal aliens in the last 25 years or so pumped into this country, most of them legalized.
[00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:15.243]  Now they want to legalize between 20 and 30 million that are left, and Obama in the last few years has stopped deportations, has given awards to illegal aliens' children that are here illegally to create a giant flood, to accelerate the deluge that was already there.
[00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:18.486]  And that has now happened.
[00:01:19.507 --> 00:01:35.160]  We sent our reporters, Jakari Jackson and others, down to the Texas border last week, and what they discovered was even worse than what libertarian and constitutional media was reporting.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:56.353]  Dinosaur Media is saying, oh America's evil, we should have totally open borders and give everyone free welfare, and you're hateful and racist if you don't take the immigrants in, and Obama not having deportations has nothing to do with the increased surge in illegals from Latin America and other parts of the world pouring across.
[00:01:57.173 --> 00:02:00.219]  Conservative media said, gee, it's terrible.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.363]  Obama is encouraging it.
[00:02:02.543 --> 00:02:03.525]  What are we going to do?
[00:02:03.926 --> 00:02:07.553]  We better pass amnesty to stop it, which will only encourage it.
[00:02:09.793 --> 00:02:26.970]  Real media, media that's been absolutely on target like InfoWars.com, DrudgeReport.com and WorldNetDaily.com have been reporting on the fact that it's a premeditated plan to implode the borders, swamp the western states so bad that the feds come in in an emergency
[00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:43.046]  And basically use this as a false flag crisis to bring in even more levels of control and force the passage of the Immigration Reform Act that supposedly gives them a legal way into the country when they're already being legalized by Fiat.
[00:02:43.586 --> 00:02:51.293]  It'd be like if your boat had a leak in it, shooting more holes in the bottom of the boat and calling that a solution to the leak you have.
[00:02:52.313 --> 00:02:59.198]  It's absolutely insane how they promote this level of nation-ending garbage.
[00:02:59.238 --> 00:03:00.559]  And this is the end of the country.
[00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:08.345]  Mexico, Guatemala, and other Central and South American nations south of southern North America, where Mexico resides,
[00:03:09.245 --> 00:03:09.345]  Are
[00:03:26.938 --> 00:03:30.922]  Women with three or four children and no husband who go directly on welfare.
[00:03:31.243 --> 00:03:34.286]  This country will go bankrupt by design.
[00:03:34.626 --> 00:03:38.470]  But that is the Democratic Party's own plan from the 1960s.
[00:03:38.871 --> 00:03:46.538]  Cloward and Piven, the sociologists, a plan to use the welfare system to bankrupt the country and then bring in total socialism.
[00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:48.720]  As a solution.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.881]  We know socialism and communism don't work for the average person.
[00:03:53.241 --> 00:04:12.629]  It does make the political class the new royalty and that's why they've been promoting it with the offshore crony capitalists who are deeply in bed with them because the crony capitalists have written the laws to make themselves largely exempt from the socialism, from the collectivism, from the taxes and the regulation.
[00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:16.110]  Like France's socialist party on record
[00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:29.336]  That pays almost no taxes and have been caught with giant Swiss bank accounts while making the general middle class have a 101% tax in 2013 and 14 to bankrupt them.
[00:04:30.077 --> 00:04:35.039]  The socialist class is tax exempt in the political area.
[00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:38.541]  Again, this is the key to the control system.
[00:04:39.441 --> 00:04:57.752]  So I wanted to take all the reports they filed last week and the reports that John Bowne and others when they got back gave us, some of which haven't even been seen yet on the nightly news, and condense it all into one big master report so you can understand just exactly what's happening.
[00:04:57.792 --> 00:05:05.897]  Because we didn't know how bad it was as much as InfoWars.com knew, as much as I understood about this takeover plan.
[00:05:07.049 --> 00:05:23.198]  I didn't realize that the Border Patrol lets the buses come in in Brownsville, McAllen, and other areas, and then once they get here, they give them vouchers to go wherever they want in the United States, where the illegal aliens say they've got family.
[00:05:23.538 --> 00:05:27.281]  And it's not just children and teenagers, it's mothers and it's fathers.
[00:05:27.421 --> 00:05:34.685]  It is the literal destitute to be attached to the government taxpayer funded system
[00:05:35.405 --> 00:05:49.325]  As the veterans don't get treatment, as death panels are set up, as old people are being euthanized, as the pension funds are being raided, as beef prices and other commodities are increasing because of dollar devaluation.
[00:05:50.547 --> 00:06:00.697]  The collapsing system in Mexico is the battering ram to bring in all the other poor Latin Americans and literally implode this country.
[00:06:00.978 --> 00:06:06.223]  We are seeing total treason unfold and take place right now in front of us.
[00:06:06.643 --> 00:06:11.989]  Now we're going to get into all the video evidence of this with Jakari Jackson narrating here in just a moment.
[00:06:13.055 --> 00:06:14.176]  And his special report.
[00:06:14.216 --> 00:06:20.664]  But first off, let's look at what we learned, thanks to our reporters going to the borders, that has now forced the mainstream media to cover this.
[00:06:21.124 --> 00:06:25.509]  Days after we broke this news last week, you would see it on Fox and CNN.
[00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.075]  In part, thanks to DrugsReport.com picking up our articles.
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:50.420]  By last Wednesday, we had caught the Border Patrol red-handed and had the emergency manager head of McAllen admit that 90-plus percent of the illegals getting off the buses had been given, again, vouchers and tickets and authorization illegally, violates federal law, by the Border Patrol under Obama's orders,
[00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:54.686]  To be sent into the interior, wherever they wanted to go.
[00:06:55.327 --> 00:06:56.308]  Unprecedented.
[00:06:56.709 --> 00:07:02.716]  I can't get a free ticket from Austin down to McAllen, but they can get one thousands of miles to Chicago, Illinois.
[00:07:04.227 --> 00:07:25.356]  After that broke, we were able to talk to a ice whistleblower who, and that's coming up, who confirmed that they're bringing in tuberculosis, smallpox, chicken pox, you name it, an absolute disaster, and that MS-13 is pouring in, and more and more Border Patrol is now just resigning in disgust
[00:07:26.056 --> 00:07:43.420]  Over all of this, because they realize now that their job is to, quote, make formula, heat formula and change diapers of the illegal aliens and act as butlers as the illegals complain that the HEB food store food is not gourmet enough.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:50.962]  Continuing in the article that went viral, Paul Watson of Infowars.com discovered
[00:07:52.205 --> 00:08:08.738]  On the federal government's own website that indeed there is a purchase order out back from January showing this was premeditated to help bring the illegal aliens in to the country and deploy them around the nation.
[00:08:09.438 --> 00:08:18.883]  And there is that particular document you can link through at InfoWars.com in this report.
[00:08:19.363 --> 00:08:22.244]  DHS to pay for illegal immigrants to be escorted into the U.S.
[00:08:22.925 --> 00:08:26.566]  and it breaks down here with a link to the federal government's own
[00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:35.737]  Public website, FedBizOpps, where you can bid on carrying out this contract.
[00:08:35.777 --> 00:08:38.339]  So, huge news on that front.
[00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:44.684]  We also documented that Evangelical, Catholic and Protestant churches getting government
[00:08:45.763 --> 00:09:11.076]  State funding through the church initiatives that Bush launched, faith-based initiative, they're being paid to pick up the illegals where the border patrol leaves off once their buses arrive and to ship them to other facilities and to get them their driver's license and voter registration cards to begin voting to pass gun control and even further open borders.
[00:09:11.116 --> 00:09:12.557]  So this is the political end
[00:09:13.597 --> 00:09:19.220]  of liberty in this country, bringing in populations that are being made dependent from the very beginning.
[00:09:19.621 --> 00:09:26.905]  And again, there's that story from PrisonPlanet.com, establishment church groups aiding illegal immigrant invasion of the United States.
[00:09:27.585 --> 00:09:31.947]  And the establishment will not stop there if they are allowed to do this.
[00:09:32.027 --> 00:09:32.528]  The sky
[00:09:33.678 --> 00:09:34.238]  is the limit.
[00:09:34.258 --> 00:09:46.427]  Hillary Clinton said last week, so did Obama, that we need Australian-style gun bans, and that gun owners are terrorizing America, and that our ideas, our rights themselves, are terrorism.
[00:09:47.327 --> 00:10:02.598]  Now I want to go to this report, again, filed by our great reporter Shikari Jackson, John Bowne, Adon Salazar, writing for InfoWars.com, and Joe Jennings, and then we will return back to the InfoWars radio show today
[00:10:02.998 --> 00:10:05.539]  Being hosted by our very own David Knight.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:11.122]  I'm Alex Jones coming to you from the new InfoWars.com television studios.
[00:10:11.562 --> 00:10:13.844]  Again, here is the special report.
[00:10:14.164 --> 00:10:16.385]  Please give this report out to your friends and family.
[00:10:16.685 --> 00:10:25.690]  This is the end of this country being replaced by total squalor and tyranny under the North American Union if we don't speak up and say no now.
[00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:32.997]  With daily reports of illegal immigrants crossing into the United States, InfoWars headed to South Texas to investigate.
[00:10:33.477 --> 00:10:42.386]  In McAllen, Texas, we found that church groups were working with the city of McAllen to transport and house illegal immigrants who had been recently released by the Border Patrol.
[00:10:42.646 --> 00:10:46.350]  Many immigrants were fleeing countries that could be considered failed states.
[00:10:46.755 --> 00:10:49.917]  Now as you can see behind me, there's a van that's ready to transport some children.
[00:10:50.277 --> 00:10:51.959]  I'm not sure if they're going to a military base.
[00:10:52.219 --> 00:10:54.120]  I'm not sure if they're going to another church facility.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:59.824]  But as you recall, our reporters went to San Antonio, Texas and encountered some children at a base there.
[00:10:59.984 --> 00:11:03.006]  The representatives we talked to did stress that the illegals
[00:11:03.066 --> 00:11:03.526]  We're good to go!
[00:11:17.807 --> 00:11:26.177]  The only ones that you'll see here are family units that are like a mom and a couple of kids that they have determined don't pose any sort of security risk.
[00:11:26.217 --> 00:11:32.544]  They have a criminal background and they've got relatives or help somewhere in the interior.
[00:11:32.925 --> 00:11:34.467]  So that category of people
[00:11:35.305 --> 00:11:38.407]  With what we learned, we went to the border in search of illegal crossings.
[00:11:38.427 --> 00:11:42.790]  We spotted a Border Patrol unit tailing us, so we pulled over to the side to see if it actually was following us, and indeed it was.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:01.221]  No longer being pursued, we headed to South Padre Island on a side mission.
[00:12:01.581 --> 00:12:05.803]  Earlier this year, Info Wars had tested radiation levels on the U.S.
[00:12:05.883 --> 00:12:06.643]  West Coast.
[00:12:07.123 --> 00:12:12.285]  And since the immigration story had brought us to the Gulf Coast, we decided to test that as well.
[00:12:13.025 --> 00:12:19.967]  During the trip, we had been in contact with an ICE agent who was eager to blow the whistle on practices in his organization.
[00:12:20.287 --> 00:12:22.888]  His report revealed chilling health concerns.
[00:12:23.228 --> 00:12:24.529]  What are you guys doing to help
[00:12:26.272 --> 00:12:27.272]  Absolutely, yeah.
[00:12:27.372 --> 00:12:47.659]  If whoever is going to be detained, they go through a lengthy screening process, doing chest x-rays, chest tuberculosis, things of that nature, and they're treated.
[00:12:47.879 --> 00:12:54.221]  They're treated, and typically, let's say for example, personal tuberculosis will not be released until either A,
[00:12:57.026 --> 00:13:14.698]  The treatment is completed, or B, they can get together with the person where they're from and get with medical there and make sure that they can continue to take their treatment when they return to their country.
[00:13:14.998 --> 00:13:18.801]  What's the most common illness that you see coming from these Central American countries?
[00:13:19.001 --> 00:13:23.384]  We do get our isolated cases of people with tuberculosis,
[00:13:25.495 --> 00:13:33.006]  There may be a couple that come through that they admit to having a communicable disease.
[00:13:34.288 --> 00:13:36.431]  But I mean, really?
[00:13:36.451 --> 00:13:39.816]  We don't check for communicable diseases.
[00:13:39.856 --> 00:13:40.237]  We don't...
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.082]  Later, our search took us to Brownsville, Texas.
[00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:51.767]  We tried to talk to the public information officer at the border crossing, but he refused to comment on camera.
[00:13:51.947 --> 00:13:56.411]  He told us to put in a media request that would be responded to within 21 days.
[00:13:56.791 --> 00:14:03.776]  While I was conversing with the PIO, a rifleman was dispatched to deal with the rest of our crew as they were filming the checkpoint.
[00:14:03.796 --> 00:14:05.117]  I just want to report some illegals!
[00:14:05.358 --> 00:14:06.759]  This guy has a gun, this guy has a...
[00:14:07.521 --> 00:14:08.201]  Assault rifle.
[00:14:08.442 --> 00:14:14.805]  Our original mission to film illegals being transported to bus stations had exceeded beyond our expectations.
[00:14:15.205 --> 00:14:20.088]  We even found out that FCC controlled media had followed in our footsteps in McAllen.
[00:14:20.508 --> 00:14:27.452]  We headed home but with one last checkpoint separating us from Austin, the security theater was impossible to avoid.
[00:14:28.132 --> 00:14:32.176]  Like the TSA, Border Patrol screens at mandatory checkpoints.
[00:14:32.717 --> 00:14:38.482]  It seems like the individual agents use their own discretion to judge who and who is not on the level.
[00:14:39.103 --> 00:14:48.892]  InfoWars reporter John Bound decided to tell the Border Patrol that if they really wanted to do their jobs effectively, he had a few suggestions on where they could find illegals.
[00:14:51.875 --> 00:14:52.556]  Hi, how you doing?
[00:14:53.857 --> 00:15:03.659]  Hey, I just want to make you aware of the fact that the organization you work for, the Border Patrol, is funding illegals coming into our country completely illegally.
[00:15:03.719 --> 00:15:04.379]  Are you aware of that?
[00:15:04.619 --> 00:15:05.239]  I am aware of that.
[00:15:05.639 --> 00:15:06.799]  We gotta talk to somebody else.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.961]  We got chased around by Border Patrol because we're American journalists.
[00:15:14.221 --> 00:15:20.942]  Now, Border Patrol is part of an illegal act against the American people.
[00:15:21.002 --> 00:15:22.482]  I'm not some whack job.
[00:15:23.231 --> 00:15:28.235]  I just wanted to bring it to your attention and let you know that you may run into more people like me.
[00:15:28.755 --> 00:15:32.178]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
