[00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:07.935]  In the wake of the tragic shooting at Fort Hood, Texas last week, Governor Rick Perry did what I expected him to do.
[00:00:09.116 --> 00:00:18.203]  He came out and ordered the flags in the state of Texas flown at half-mast, which on the surface seems like a nice thing to do.
[00:00:19.175 --> 00:00:25.038]  But it was Joseph Stalin, one of history's greatest tyrants, that said, when one man dies, it's a tragedy.
[00:00:25.478 --> 00:00:28.699]  When 10,000 die, it's a statistic.
[00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:31.140]  22 veterans commit suicide every day.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.061]  Seven of them active duty.
[00:00:33.261 --> 00:00:34.141]  That's a world record.
[00:00:34.682 --> 00:00:37.563]  Even breaking the record that we saw at the end of Vietnam.
[00:00:38.263 --> 00:00:39.604]  There's no discussion of that.
[00:00:39.904 --> 00:00:43.465]  They just throw more psychotropic drugs at them, known to cause suicide.
[00:00:43.705 --> 00:00:45.686]  They make them serve more and more deployments.
[00:00:45.986 --> 00:00:47.047]  They treat them like crap.
[00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:57.587]  A lot of them are going bankrupt, they cut their pay, they screw them over, but it's okay because Rick Perry put the flags at half-mast and we all feel sorry for the dead.
[00:00:58.467 --> 00:01:08.833]  The three dead, four of you count the shooter, 16 wounded, when we've got 22 people killing themselves, seven every single day who are active duty.
[00:01:08.853 --> 00:01:09.394]  Think about that.
[00:01:09.874 --> 00:01:13.516]  The flag makes us feel good, like we're doing something for the veterans.
[00:01:13.616 --> 00:01:16.138]  It's sentimental, it's totally on the surface.
[00:01:17.168 --> 00:01:18.188]  Just like Obamacare.
[00:01:18.588 --> 00:01:19.469]  They say it's free.
[00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:21.089]  They say you can keep your doctor.
[00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.770]  You like your plan and your doctor, you can keep them.
[00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.550]  You'll be able to keep your health care plan.
[00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.371]  If you like your plan, you keep your plan.
[00:01:28.391 --> 00:01:31.672]  If you like your doctor, you like your plan, you can keep your doctor.
[00:01:31.712 --> 00:01:32.532]  You can keep your plan.
[00:01:32.552 --> 00:01:33.352]  They say it's wonderful.
[00:01:33.652 --> 00:01:34.432]  All of it's lies.
[00:01:34.793 --> 00:01:36.433]  Raises payroll taxes on poor people.
[00:01:36.793 --> 00:01:37.753]  Gets rid of your doctor.
[00:01:38.013 --> 00:01:39.314]  Doubles or triples prices.
[00:01:39.654 --> 00:01:41.214]  Written by the big insurance companies.
[00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:42.915]  Lets them lower the standard of care.
[00:01:43.255 --> 00:01:43.755]  Doesn't matter.
[00:01:44.455 --> 00:01:47.077]  Obama loves you and wanted to give you something.
[00:01:47.458 --> 00:01:50.160]  Like Perry gave us a flag at half-mast.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.242]  And I'm not just attacking Rick Perry.
[00:01:53.303 --> 00:01:56.205]  He would be attacked if he didn't put the flag at half-mast.
[00:01:56.686 --> 00:01:58.327]  What does that say about us?
[00:01:59.028 --> 00:02:07.475]  We want to feel good about ourselves while not actually getting our hands dirty and finding out why the so-called volunteer army is killing itself.
[00:02:08.342 --> 00:02:23.905]  The truth is, too many deployments, drugs known to cause suicide, sweeping it under the rug, veterans being treated like crap, all these Homeland Security reports saying veterans are the number one terror threat in the future, that the Tea Party is a threat, that evangelicals are a threat.
[00:02:25.146 --> 00:02:29.126]  Simply put, the veterans are being treated like garbage and that's why they're committing suicide.
[00:02:29.466 --> 00:02:31.667]  And so we need to stop treating them like garbage
[00:02:32.617 --> 00:02:36.699]  Not just pat him on the head or give the dog a bone by flying the flag at half-mast.
[00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:46.964]  It really is absurd, and it really illustrates how we've become a nation of BSers, run by a culture of PR pitchmen.
[00:02:47.824 --> 00:02:49.905]  In fact, they're getting rid of the White House Press Corps now.
[00:02:50.345 --> 00:02:52.106]  They're not even going to have regular press conferences.
[00:02:53.226 --> 00:02:53.886]  And why should they?
[00:02:54.106 --> 00:03:00.790]  They can just have PR flaks, put out the lies, and then the accomplice media, the lapdog press, will go along with it.
[00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.293]  So that's why every time I saw the flags this last weekend at half-mast, it irritated me.
[00:03:07.973 --> 00:03:18.698]  Because it reminded me of how, not just the veterans, but foster children, anybody who's in government care, or in government clutches, is treated like absolute garbage.
[00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.919]  And how
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:31.524]  As the government and Obamacare and the school lunch program federalize everything, more and more, I am a slave of this system, just as you are, and I want off this plantation.
[00:03:32.344 --> 00:03:34.304]  I don't want to see our veterans treated like crap.
[00:03:35.065 --> 00:03:39.006]  I don't want to see the politicians exempt from all the things they do to us.
[00:03:39.646 --> 00:03:48.029]  I want to see them out there fighting for this empire if they think it's so great, but we know the rich kids of Congress almost never go to war.
