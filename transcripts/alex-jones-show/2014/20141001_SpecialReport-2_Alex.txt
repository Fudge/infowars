[00:00:11.983 --> 00:00:22.125]  Golf addict, President Obama doesn't care that you know he played roughly 800 hours of golf on about 200 golf trips since he was crowned Imperial Bankster Puppet in 2009.
[00:00:22.805 --> 00:00:37.869]  With the stock market bubble about to burst, civil unrest, a third of the country unemployed and eating from the taxpayer trough, disease, ISIS, drug cartels on our borders and inside our country, nope, President Obama only shows up to work, according to the Daily Caller, 700 times.
[00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:43.113]  100 times less than his cherished golf outings.
[00:00:43.713 --> 00:00:45.115]  Pretty nice gig, huh?
[00:00:45.735 --> 00:00:51.281]  What if the average American worker got to spend more time goofing off than actually working?
[00:00:51.401 --> 00:01:02.672]  The average American worker is breaking their back working two to three jobs just to make rent, while Obama's corporacratic golf buddies earn 331 times as much as the average American worker.
[00:01:02.992 --> 00:01:09.857]  Hey, does it really matter that he teed off immediately after gripping the hearts and minds with his heartfelt speech about beheaded journalist James Foley?
[00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:13.740]  Let's go while we're young!
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.700]  You mind, sir?
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.881]  Trying to tee off?
[00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:23.166]  Why should he be bothered with briefings on ISIS from intelligence since 2012 when he has a tee time to catch?
[00:01:23.707 --> 00:01:32.613]  There is no doubt that their advance, their movement over the last several months has been more rapid than
[00:01:34.213 --> 00:01:42.777]  Well, ISIS isn't that big a deal.
[00:01:42.797 --> 00:01:46.619]  They're only threatening to cross our borders and take over America.
[00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:49.160]  But who am I to criticize the President?
[00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:52.357]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:01:52.577 --> 00:01:54.520]  He's literally surrounded by incompetence.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.589]  You know, I've been there for hundreds of fence jumpers, and they never make it even close.
[00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:03.894]  You know, we have dogs, there's multiple layers of security.
[00:02:04.355 --> 00:02:05.477]  There was a failure here.
[00:02:05.717 --> 00:02:09.540]  His hooker crazed secret service can't even keep one man out of the White House.
[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.203]  But that will probably roll out as another excuse for them not to do their job.
[00:02:14.523 --> 00:02:20.087]  As we all cower in fear whether or not Obama's life is safe, another question comes to mind.
[00:02:20.467 --> 00:02:23.048]  Is America safe under Obama?
[00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:26.311]  Obama has decimated the friggin' Constitution.
[00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:30.293]  So I don't give a damn because if he doesn't follow the Constitution, we don't have business.
[00:02:43.117 --> 00:02:45.399]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:48.521]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
