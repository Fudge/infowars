[00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:03.293]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:00:04.014 --> 00:00:07.217]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:14.983 --> 00:00:15.624]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.284 --> 00:00:17.325]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.065 --> 00:00:19.166]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.827 --> 00:00:20.627]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.408 --> 00:00:22.308]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.611]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.132 --> 00:00:31.195]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.505 --> 00:00:37.868]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Wednesday, July 2nd, 2014.
[00:00:38.528 --> 00:00:40.290]  I'm David Knight, your host for this hour.
[00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:51.560]  Alex is going to be joining us later in the show, and we're also going to have an interview with Harry Dent, an economist who is going to talk to us about the metrics of what's happening.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.002]  We've got a pretty high stock market right now.
[00:00:54.022 --> 00:00:54.882]  The Dow hit 17,000 this week.
[00:00:56.744 --> 00:01:00.505]  He thinks that's at the top, and he's going to talk about what he thinks is next.
[00:01:00.605 --> 00:01:02.586]  And he's not the only one who's talking about that.
[00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:07.168]  We've got Donald Trump saying that Americans need to prepare for financial ruin.
[00:01:07.888 --> 00:01:10.069]  But he's going to be joining us later in the show.
[00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:14.371]  Of course, yesterday we had Peter Van Buren, who was talking about the ghost of Tom Jode.
[00:01:15.231 --> 00:01:24.259]  Essentially a retelling of the Depression-era story of Grapes of Wrath, putting that in the context of not the Dust Bowl, but the Rust Belt.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.401]  So that was kind of a fictional take on it.
[00:01:26.421 --> 00:01:31.226]  Today we're going to have someone who's going to talk to us about the economics of it, about the metrics of it.
[00:01:32.267 --> 00:01:39.794]  We have a couple of stories that are breaking, you know, even as I was driving into work today, even PBS is talking about health concerns at the border.
[00:01:41.147 --> 00:01:54.860]  As the border collapses and we see anyone and everyone coming in, as we see people being held in very close quarters in conditions that are less than ideal for sanity, we see that even they're talking about it, but of course they're downplaying the risk.
[00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.764]  They're talking about it because they want to reassure people that there's not any risk.
[00:01:59.284 --> 00:02:00.725]  Well, there actually is.
[00:02:00.805 --> 00:02:13.593]  And you know, as we interviewed people over the weekend, we were told by Border Patrol agents, and there's a story that's still up on Drudge today, two more swine flu cases confirmed among minor detainees and other two treated for flu-like symptoms.
[00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:15.074]  This is Don Salazar's story.
[00:02:15.654 --> 00:02:17.415]  We talked to Border Patrol agents there.
[00:02:17.435 --> 00:02:18.496]  They were very concerned.
[00:02:18.996 --> 00:02:25.141]  Border Patrol agents are testing positive for some of these diseases, not just H1N1, but other diseases that are coming in.
[00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:29.644]  They contacted the CDC, and the CDC said, that's not our job.
[00:02:30.265 --> 00:02:43.955]  Clearly they're not worried about it, but they are worried enough about it to essentially tell the government mouthpieces and the mainstream media to start reassuring the public that, don't worry, we're not going to open the door to a pandemic, or maybe to terrorism, or to drug cartels.
[00:02:44.055 --> 00:02:46.477]  It's just for the children that we're collapsing the borders.
[00:02:47.317 --> 00:03:02.596]  Also up today, we've got a story, a further breakdown of what happened with Facebook as people discovered that they were part of a very large experiment to see if Facebook, with its massive reach, could manipulate the public's mood.
[00:03:03.357 --> 00:03:03.677]  Answer?
[00:03:03.897 --> 00:03:04.618]  Yes they can.
[00:03:04.858 --> 00:03:05.838]  But there's a little bit more to that.
[00:03:06.338 --> 00:03:09.840]  Actually they're linked to Pentagon research on civil unrest.
[00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.921]  This is a story that's up on InfoWars.
[00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:19.444]  Steve Watson points out that the research appears to be at least in part connected to a Pentagon-led project called the Minerva Initiative.
[00:03:19.904 --> 00:03:23.386]  So we're going to break that down for you and the connections there at Cornell University.
[00:03:23.906 --> 00:03:25.747]  But there's a huge story that's coming out.
[00:03:25.787 --> 00:03:28.488]  Of course a bill has been introduced in California
[00:03:28.948 --> 00:03:30.250]  California is AB 1014.
[00:03:32.534 --> 00:03:35.799]  Label the most draconian gun control legislation in the country.
[00:03:36.721 --> 00:03:42.991]  This is a bill that would allow the police to confiscate guns based on accusation alone.
[00:03:44.025 --> 00:03:46.428]  Based on accusation alone.
[00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.294]  Now, this is something that ought to concern everyone.
[00:03:50.314 --> 00:03:53.118]  Not just people who favor gun control.
[00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:58.805]  This is something that even the people who favor gun control should say should be concerned about this.
[00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:05.211]  Because this is another area where they're gutting due process and real trials.
[00:04:05.271 --> 00:04:10.836]  It's another area where we're moving into a kind of a star chamber legal system.
[00:04:11.196 --> 00:04:12.357]  You know, we have the FISA court.
[00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:13.538]  That's not a real court.
[00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.380]  It's just a single judge.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.182]  No adversarial relationship there.
[00:04:17.662 --> 00:04:18.102]  No jury.
[00:04:18.843 --> 00:04:23.026]  You don't have a jury of your peers before your rights are taken away with this?
[00:04:23.306 --> 00:04:26.588]  We should be very concerned about things like the FISA Court.
[00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:31.732]  We should be very concerned about things like this California law, regardless of the issue.
[00:04:32.052 --> 00:04:41.119]  Whether it's about guns or whatever, we should be concerned that people's fundamental rights, that their property, can be taken away merely by accusation.
[00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.640]  We're going to be talking more about that.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.502]  And of course, at the same time that's happening, we learned that
[00:04:46.002 --> 00:04:54.897]  From the Wall Street Journal, that Janet Yellen, the new Fed Commission, has this massive security detail surrounding her as if she was a President of the United States.
[00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:57.121]  That's the double standard.
[00:04:57.402 --> 00:04:58.243]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:58.423 --> 00:04:58.964]  Stay with us.
[00:05:08.982 --> 00:05:10.863]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:05:11.203 --> 00:05:19.127]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:05:19.248 --> 00:05:26.311]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:05:26.812 --> 00:05:31.054]  I just received my Male Vitality about three days ago and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[00:05:31.394 --> 00:05:41.597]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[00:05:42.017 --> 00:05:48.179]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:50.740]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.741]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:56.482]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[00:05:56.842 --> 00:06:00.764]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.
[00:06:01.004 --> 00:06:07.927]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:15.044]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential Fort Hood situation?
[00:06:15.085 --> 00:06:18.407]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:06:18.427 --> 00:06:20.129]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant!
[00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:26.435]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:26.535 --> 00:06:32.440]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.343]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:06:36.523 --> 00:06:39.425]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:06:39.605 --> 00:06:47.611]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:06:47.871 --> 00:06:49.933]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:06:49.973 --> 00:06:51.034]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:06:51.394 --> 00:07:00.120]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.762]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.

[00:07:09.428 --> 00:07:11.209]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:18.694]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[00:07:19.154 --> 00:07:29.581]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[00:07:30.002 --> 00:07:39.228]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[00:07:39.948 --> 00:07:43.369]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:47.431]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[00:07:47.771 --> 00:07:49.331]  Experience the new formula.
[00:07:49.831 --> 00:07:51.792]  Experience the ancient purity.
[00:07:52.392 --> 00:07:53.693]  Shield your family.
[00:07:53.733 --> 00:07:55.113]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:07:55.553 --> 00:07:58.134]  Available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:58.714 --> 00:08:02.696]  X2 from InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:08:21.824 --> 00:08:24.046]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:24.466 --> 00:08:29.750]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:08:30.791 --> 00:08:37.696]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Wednesday, July 2nd, 2014.
[00:08:39.037 --> 00:08:39.738]  I'm David Knight.
[00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:44.262]  Alex Jones is going to be joining us live in the studio later in the show.
[00:08:44.682 --> 00:08:49.746]  We're also going to have Harry Dent, the economist, talking to us about what he sees as the challenges ahead
[00:08:50.246 --> 00:08:57.550]  Of course, yesterday we had Peter Van Buren giving us a fictional look at the current situation in America's decline since the 1950s.
[00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.051]  Kind of a retelling of the Grapes of Wrath.
[00:09:00.471 --> 00:09:02.792]  Calls it the Ghost of Tom Jode.
[00:09:03.133 --> 00:09:03.673]  The story of the 99%.
[00:09:04.653 --> 00:09:08.095]  He looks at the decline since the 1950s.
[00:09:08.135 --> 00:09:16.479]  And of course, as we heard Hemingway say in his book, The Sun Also Rises, one of the characters is asked how he went bankrupt.
[00:09:16.499 --> 00:09:19.301]  He said, well, gradually at first, and then suddenly.
[00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:22.403]  And that's the way we believe this is going to roll out.
[00:09:22.483 --> 00:09:24.145]  Things are certainly accelerating.
[00:09:24.185 --> 00:09:44.962]  We have the collapse of the border as part of the Cloward and Piven strategy, strategized back in the 1960s to collapse the United States with a welfare state, an entitlement state, to rapidly increase that to the point that it could no longer be sustained so they could rebuild on the ruins of America the kind of socialist utopia that they want to see.
[00:09:45.823 --> 00:09:52.367]  And that is a common recurring theme to see people talking about destroying America so they can rebuild their socialist utopia.
[00:09:52.747 --> 00:09:55.808]  We went to see America Last Night by Dinesh D'Souza.
[00:09:55.828 --> 00:09:57.049]  It was an early release.
[00:09:57.109 --> 00:09:58.630]  It's official release is today.
[00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:00.531]  And that was a common theme.
[00:10:00.891 --> 00:10:05.874]  You hear that a lot, that America has to be destroyed so that we can rebuild something completely different.
[00:10:06.514 --> 00:10:07.275]  I liked the film.
[00:10:07.355 --> 00:10:08.355]  I give it a thumbs up.
[00:10:08.395 --> 00:10:11.097]  I'm going to talk a little bit later, though, a little bit more qualified about that.
[00:10:11.177 --> 00:10:17.240]  We went, several of us with Infowars, went there last night and we uploaded a review that's now up on YouTube.
[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:25.185]  Jakari Jackson, Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, Kit Daniels and I, and my son Travis, we all went and we talked what we saw about that.
[00:10:25.285 --> 00:10:30.068]  But I wanted to break that down a little bit more because I think there's a little bit more to it.
[00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:32.530]  You know, the movie that I really am anxious to see,
[00:10:33.536 --> 00:10:39.279]  Was the one that they previewed, which was about Gary Webb that's coming up in October.
[00:10:39.299 --> 00:10:40.460]  It's called Kill the Messenger.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.581]  It's played by Jeremy Renner.
[00:10:42.821 --> 00:10:52.646]  I hope, I hope that they're going to really lay out what happened with Iran-Contra, with the crack cocaine epidemic that the CIA created in L.A.
[00:10:52.706 --> 00:10:56.628]  with freeway Ricky Ross and the murder of Gary Webb.
[00:10:56.648 --> 00:10:58.329]  Not the suicide of Gary Webb.
[00:10:58.849 --> 00:10:59.529]  He was killed.
[00:10:59.549 --> 00:11:00.670]  I hated to see.
[00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:08.395]  One of the things I didn't like in the Dinesh D'Souza movie was, although he talked about Aaron Schwartz, he talked about it as if he had been driven to suicide.
[00:11:09.035 --> 00:11:14.538]  I don't believe that his psychological outlook was one that was conducive to suicide.
[00:11:14.578 --> 00:11:16.799]  We've seen this so many, many times.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.882]  And I don't think that Aaron Schwartz was driven to suicide.
[00:11:21.702 --> 00:11:30.866]  Uh, Carmen Ortiz, the prosecutor there, her husband, tweeted that they had offered him a deal, not a 35 year in prison, but just a few months, and he turned that down.
[00:11:30.926 --> 00:11:31.686]  He was a fighter.
[00:11:31.746 --> 00:11:34.668]  He was every bit as much of a fighter as Dinesh D'Souza.
[00:11:35.468 --> 00:11:39.630]  And if Dinesh D'Souza suddenly commits suicide, I'm not going to believe that either.
[00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:41.791]  I think you ought to see this movie.
[00:11:41.811 --> 00:11:43.132]  I think there's a lot to talk about.
[00:11:43.172 --> 00:11:45.093]  It talks about real, substantive stuff.
[00:11:45.113 --> 00:11:48.155]  I mean, go to see it instead of Transformers.
[00:11:48.175 --> 00:11:54.580]  I mean, you'll be talking about Transformers and asking yourself and everybody that saw it, what was that about if you do go waste your money on that?
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.101]  But this is something that's real.
[00:11:56.141 --> 00:11:57.722]  This is something that you can talk about.
[00:11:57.742 --> 00:12:05.947]  And of course, you're not going to agree with everything he has to say because it's politics and nobody agrees totally on politics just like they don't agree on religion.
[00:12:06.548 --> 00:12:09.730]  Now, we have a key story that's up on Infowars.com today.
[00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:15.633]  A bill would allow the police to confiscate guns based on accusations alone.
[00:12:15.673 --> 00:12:19.114]  This is California's bill AB1014.
[00:12:19.494 --> 00:12:23.076]  Labeled the most draconian gun control legislation in the country.
[00:12:23.556 --> 00:12:34.702]  They would allow the police to confiscate a person's firearms solely on the basis of an accusation made against the gun owner by a family member or a health professional.
[00:12:35.512 --> 00:12:41.057]  See, that's one of the dangerous things that we did in the wake of some of these mass shootings.
[00:12:41.798 --> 00:12:48.904]  People on the right started saying, hey, we need to give the psychological community power over our lives.
[00:12:49.565 --> 00:12:51.467]  That is insane.
[00:12:51.987 --> 00:12:52.928]  That's really insane.
[00:12:53.008 --> 00:12:59.714]  And people, even people who support gun control, should be concerned about this because of the loss of due process.
[00:13:00.575 --> 00:13:07.979]  In so many areas of our lives, we are seeing due process thrown under the bus, shredded, destroyed.
[00:13:08.479 --> 00:13:14.802]  Whether it's the NDAA or whether it's things like this, we need to have an adversarial trial.
[00:13:15.102 --> 00:13:20.204]  We need to have a real trial, with a judge, with somebody representing the other side.
[00:13:20.665 --> 00:13:21.845]  We need to have a jury.
[00:13:22.205 --> 00:13:24.206]  We've pretty much lost jury trials.
[00:13:24.246 --> 00:13:25.087]  They've used
[00:13:26.027 --> 00:13:30.611]  Threats and escalated the charges so much that most people don't go with the jury trial.
[00:13:30.991 --> 00:13:37.657]  And part of that is because the judges have been lying to the juries about what their real power and their responsibility is.
[00:13:37.717 --> 00:13:43.182]  We need fully informed juries who understand that they're not there just to judge the facts of the law.
[00:13:43.603 --> 00:13:45.784]  They're there to judge the law itself.
[00:13:46.525 --> 00:13:55.852]  We have many state constitutions that say that explicitly, and it is implied in all of the history of English common law that that is the responsibility of juries.
[00:13:56.192 --> 00:13:57.854]  We have to watch each other's backs.
[00:13:58.294 --> 00:14:03.338]  That's where the people have their greatest power, in veto, and that is in vetoing laws.
[00:14:03.658 --> 00:14:08.622]  That's one of the ways we stopped alcohol prohibition, even before they repealed that amendment.
[00:14:09.382 --> 00:14:13.546]  So this is something that ought to concern everybody, and here's an example that's given out of the
[00:14:14.625 --> 00:14:15.365]  Out of the article.
[00:14:15.765 --> 00:14:29.870]  If, for example, person A goes to a judge and files a complaint about person B, person B can then have his or her guns and gun rights taken away without any idea why or to even have a chance to plead their case.
[00:14:30.711 --> 00:14:33.732]  Do you really want to throw due process away to that extent?
[00:14:34.412 --> 00:14:44.717]  Only after law enforcement searched person B, their family, friends, place of work, anywhere else that police might have thought person B would hide guns, would that person then have the right to defend themselves.
[00:14:44.797 --> 00:14:47.819]  You would be guilty until proven innocent.
[00:14:48.539 --> 00:14:49.980]  You know, we've seen that happen
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:15:07.848]  With all of the regulatory agencies, they all operate under this civil idea that because they're going to file a quote-unquote civil action against you, whether it's the IRS or the EPA or the Bureau of Land Management or whoever it is, all of these organizations that have been created
[00:15:09.295 --> 00:15:18.264]  The Congress has essentially abdicated their legislative responsibilities to these groups, these fiefdoms, these bureaucracies.
[00:15:18.805 --> 00:15:23.810]  They create their own internal courts where you are guilty and have to prove your innocence.
[00:15:24.611 --> 00:15:28.053]  They even have, in many cases now, their own police that they're heavily arming.
[00:15:28.513 --> 00:15:31.455]  We need to be very concerned about this trend in America.
[00:15:31.555 --> 00:15:33.876]  And look at this hypocrisy.
[00:15:34.256 --> 00:15:39.559]  We see the Wall Street Journal reporting that the security detail for Fed Chairwoman irks her neighbors.
[00:15:39.639 --> 00:15:40.660]  This is Janet Yellen.
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:47.486]  They said one of the most powerful economic policy makers in the world moved into the neighborhood and ruined it, according to many.
[00:15:47.826 --> 00:16:01.078]  They say the neighbors said earlier this year the security detail protecting new Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen barreled through the cul-de-sac where she lives in oversized vans loaded with guns, cameras and take-out pizza.
[00:16:01.658 --> 00:16:18.250]  It established an armed camp, they said, next door to Mrs. Forman's townhome according to a written bill of grievance presented by concerned neighbors demanding that the uniformed police presence is uncomfortable for residents of various religious persuasions like Quakers.
[00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:20.031]  But listen to some of the things that they do.
[00:16:20.071 --> 00:16:21.372]  They have said security trucks
[00:16:22.574 --> 00:16:32.118]  Weighing approximately 7,000 pounds each, sit idling on the street for approximately 22 minutes each day as she's getting ready for her morning pickup.
[00:16:32.899 --> 00:16:36.320]  And then, of course, they race out along with their Secret Service police.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:44.144]  The government is paying $5,000 or $6,000 a month or more to rent an entire townhome in Georgetown to put the cops in.
[00:16:44.963 --> 00:16:54.526]  Now, this picture that's at the top of the article has a card stuck in the window that says, Federal Reserve Police on Official Business.
[00:16:55.426 --> 00:17:00.988]  Yeah, we're offering the kind of protection to this private corporation.
[00:17:01.148 --> 00:17:05.109]  The head of this private corporation, the Federal Reserve, is not federal.
[00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:06.270]  It is private.
[00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:09.891]  And this bankster, this gangster, is getting
[00:17:10.851 --> 00:17:14.537]  Security from the Feds like she's the President or the Vice President.
[00:17:14.558 --> 00:17:19.105]  We didn't provide this kind of security probably to the President before World War II.
[00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:22.010]  And now look at what we do for our banker-in-chief.
[00:17:23.564 --> 00:17:31.331]  Now as we're talking about prohibition and what they're doing, what they're trying to do with guns, we should remember how this turned out with alcohol prohibition.
[00:17:31.911 --> 00:17:36.215]  We should remember how it turned out with marijuana prohibition, for example.
[00:17:36.676 --> 00:17:38.337]  Look at this report from the Liberty Crier.
[00:17:38.357 --> 00:17:44.403]  It says six months of legal marijuana and Colorado has more cash and less crime.
[00:17:44.983 --> 00:17:53.632]  Now they point out that there's been a 10% decrease in overall crime from the last year in Colorado and a 5.2% drop in violent crime.
[00:17:54.152 --> 00:17:58.897]  They have taken in $10 million in taxes in just 10 months.
[00:17:59.898 --> 00:18:00.278]  Guess what?
[00:18:01.107 --> 00:18:02.228]  We can handle freedom.
[00:18:03.028 --> 00:18:06.170]  We can handle marijuana and guns.
[00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:15.194]  What we can't handle is prohibition, because prohibition gives a monopoly to the worst elements of society, to organized crime.
[00:18:15.554 --> 00:18:19.396]  That's why you've got a lot of law enforcement against prohibition.
[00:18:19.776 --> 00:18:21.978]  I've talked many times to that organization, LEAP.
[00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:26.180]  We've interviewed them on the nightly news, on the radio here.
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:31.742]  They're against prohibition because prohibition itself is a problem.
[00:18:32.022 --> 00:18:33.583]  It destroys society.
[00:18:33.663 --> 00:18:34.863]  It increases crime.
[00:18:35.383 --> 00:18:39.825]  And you're going to see crime increase a lot if you prohibit guns.
[00:18:40.545 --> 00:18:43.166]  Even more so than the prohibition of marijuana.
[00:18:43.446 --> 00:18:44.127]  You're going to see
[00:18:45.007 --> 00:18:50.952]  Guns take a new and virulent form as they're released into a free black market.
[00:18:50.972 --> 00:18:58.679]  You're going to see design take off, just like you've seen in alcohol prohibition, the increase in the concentration of alcohol.
[00:18:58.699 --> 00:19:02.582]  Just as you saw in all drug prohibition, the increase in concentration.
[00:19:02.783 --> 00:19:06.185]  Even in marijuana, they increased it during prohibition.
[00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:07.166]  And of course,
[00:19:08.689 --> 00:19:09.810]  News has also come out.
[00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:10.510]  This is interesting.
[00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.311]  This is up on Infowars.com.
[00:19:12.512 --> 00:19:18.275]  Former Arizona Governor Gary Johnson is now becoming the CEO of a pot company.
[00:19:18.756 --> 00:19:20.137]  He says, I'm excited about this.
[00:19:20.677 --> 00:19:24.580]  I think this is really a change in the world kind of thing.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.041]  The company is going to be Nevada-based.
[00:19:27.562 --> 00:19:30.183]  It's Cannabis Sativa or Sativa.
[00:19:30.203 --> 00:19:31.184]  I don't know how to pronounce it.
[00:19:31.244 --> 00:19:31.704]  Sativa.
[00:19:31.764 --> 00:19:32.165]  Thank you.
[00:19:32.265 --> 00:19:32.585]  Thank you.
[00:19:33.766 --> 00:19:35.867]  So anyway, that's going to bear watching.
[00:19:35.907 --> 00:19:38.049]  Now, on economics news, we have
[00:19:39.309 --> 00:19:42.571]  We have a lot of news coming up and we're going to be right back.
[00:19:42.591 --> 00:19:48.275]  We're coming up to a break but of course Donald Trump is telling us that we need to prepare for financial ruin.
[00:19:48.875 --> 00:19:54.358]  And of course later in the show we're going to be talking to Harry Dent and we're going to see what he thinks.
[00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:56.080]  What he thinks about the timing.
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:59.462]  We've talked in recent days to Gerald Cilenti and others.
[00:20:00.282 --> 00:20:04.464]  It is accelerating, and we need to be aware of what's going on, and we need to take precautions.
[00:20:04.484 --> 00:20:09.167]  We'll be right back, and I'm going to give you a little bit more of my take on Dinesh D'Souza's America.
[00:20:09.207 --> 00:20:09.527]  Stay with us.

[00:21:26.374 --> 00:21:30.757]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.

[00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:12.075]  Hey folks, this is Larry Crisp for babyboomerbackupplan.com.
[00:23:12.275 --> 00:23:15.438]  I don't have to tell you, this economy sucks.
[00:23:15.979 --> 00:23:23.067]  Unlike the political elite and Wall Street bankers, you know that debts don't disappear and bailouts have big consequences.
[00:23:23.487 --> 00:23:29.953]  Stock and real estate market bubbles can pop at any moment and evaporate most or all of your retirement savings.
[00:23:30.294 --> 00:23:34.478]  Folks, we're in the weakest economy of our lifetime and it's likely to get much worse.
[00:23:34.798 --> 00:23:40.664]  Virtually zero sectors of the economy are hiring and workforce participation is at record lows.
[00:23:41.124 --> 00:23:47.969]  And I'm here to tell you, this may be the best thing that could happen to you if you move decidedly and develop a backup plan immediately.
[00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:53.812]  Proportionately more millionaires were created during the Great Depression than at any time in history.
[00:23:53.952 --> 00:23:55.854]  And history is about to repeat itself.

[00:24:09.651 --> 00:24:28.516]  No one knows what it's like To be the bad man To be the sad man Behind blue eyes No one knows what it's like To behave
[00:24:30.182 --> 00:24:31.523]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:31.603 --> 00:24:32.283]  I'm David Knight.
[00:24:32.343 --> 00:24:39.827]  Now, Alex is going to be joining us live in the studio to cover news as well as to interview Harry Dent on the economy.
[00:24:40.568 --> 00:24:43.389]  There's a lot of economic news that's popped out in the last couple of days.
[00:24:43.409 --> 00:24:51.473]  Of course, we know that the border collapse is part of a planned economic collapse of America, but it's not just there that it's happening.
[00:24:51.513 --> 00:24:56.056]  We're going to see some massive new taxes everywhere that are going to be rolling out.
[00:24:56.716 --> 00:25:01.132]  One of those is coming in the form of highway taxes, as I reported just last week.
[00:25:02.176 --> 00:25:09.639]  We see all of these mainstream media outlets talking about a 12-cent hike in the federal gas tax.
[00:25:09.759 --> 00:25:11.379]  A 12-cent hike.
[00:25:11.959 --> 00:25:13.100]  It's not a 12-cent hike.
[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:17.201]  Right now, the federal gas tax is 18 cents per gallon.
[00:25:17.581 --> 00:25:24.183]  So if you add 12 cents to that, you're doing a 67% increase in federal taxes.
[00:25:24.644 --> 00:25:26.924]  Now, Obama released this plan yesterday.
[00:25:26.944 --> 00:25:28.305]  It's a very large plan.
[00:25:29.125 --> 00:25:34.449]  He says his highway plan is not crazy, it's not socialism, and it's not an imperial presidency.
[00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:38.311]  Well, actually, it's going to be a lot of corporate cronyism.
[00:25:38.391 --> 00:25:41.553]  It's going to be a lot of corporate fascism, economic fascism.
[00:25:41.933 --> 00:25:43.715]  But there is a socialist aspect of it.
[00:25:44.395 --> 00:25:52.197]  Even though they're going to increase all of these taxes, a lot of these taxes are not going to be going to your roads and to your bridges.
[00:25:52.237 --> 00:25:58.279]  They're going to be building the socialist dream, and that is light rail, commuter trains, that sort of thing.
[00:25:58.299 --> 00:25:59.479]  Here's a clip from Obama.
[00:26:00.259 --> 00:26:01.100]  It's not crazy.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:03.680]  It's not socialism.
[00:26:06.201 --> 00:26:13.263]  You know, it's not the imperial presidency.
[00:26:15.362 --> 00:26:16.363]  No laws are broken.
[00:26:16.804 --> 00:26:22.549]  We're just building roads and bridges like we've been doing for the last, I don't know, 50, 100 years?
[00:26:22.569 --> 00:26:22.769]  Yeah, right.
[00:26:25.666 --> 00:26:28.549]  It's also not a 12 cent bump.
[00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:32.732]  It is a 67 percent bump in gas lien taxes.
[00:26:33.092 --> 00:26:34.914]  And that's not the only place where they're going up on things.
[00:26:34.934 --> 00:26:39.118]  We've got a article on Infowars.com from Zero Hedge.
[00:26:39.458 --> 00:26:46.424]  It says interest on new student loans is going to rise by 20 percent starting July the 1st.
[00:26:46.584 --> 00:26:48.826]  All new loans for the 2013-2014 student year will increase from 3.86
[00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:54.271]  We're good to go.
[00:27:05.663 --> 00:27:09.605]  What they're doing is, look at this in the context of what's happening at the border.
[00:27:09.645 --> 00:27:23.514]  They're opening the border, they're offering either in-state tuition to illegal citizens, as John Bowne calls them, and that's a good way to put it, because of course, as he said, they're illegal, but they get all of the benefits of citizens.
[00:27:23.574 --> 00:27:25.435]  Actually, they get even more benefits than citizens.
[00:27:25.495 --> 00:27:32.039]  Citizens can't go to another state that they haven't lived in and get in-state tuition, but the illegal citizens can.
[00:27:32.719 --> 00:27:35.422]  They can even get full ride tuition at many of these places.
[00:27:35.462 --> 00:27:49.055]  Now, if you're an American citizen, if you're a legal citizen, then you're going to have to essentially work for these banksters the rest of your life, because even if you go bankrupt, you're not going to be able to get rid of the student debt.
[00:27:49.836 --> 00:27:54.000]  But of course, there is a way for you to get out, and that is if you will pledge to do
[00:27:55.041 --> 00:27:58.582]  Indentured servitude to the federal government, to Washington.
[00:27:59.583 --> 00:28:00.503]  People are catching on.
[00:28:00.543 --> 00:28:06.885]  You know, Obama just came out in a Quinnipiac poll that voters think he's the worst president since 1945.
[00:28:06.925 --> 00:28:12.727]  33% of the voters think that Obama is worse than any other president since World War II.
[00:28:13.527 --> 00:28:14.868]  George Bush came in second at 28%.
[00:28:16.568 --> 00:28:18.369]  Third place was Richard Nixon and he was at 13%.
[00:28:18.409 --> 00:28:19.389]  Jimmy Carter was at 8%.
[00:28:22.961 --> 00:28:26.523]  You know, there's something else that people can agree on, and this is a very good sign.
[00:28:27.243 --> 00:28:31.426]  74% of Americans don't believe that they have to give up privacy for security.
[00:28:32.286 --> 00:28:34.547]  That is a false trade.
[00:28:34.927 --> 00:28:37.849]  Just like giving up your liberty for security.
[00:28:37.929 --> 00:28:41.931]  If you give up your liberty for security, you will never have any security.
[00:28:42.391 --> 00:28:44.392]  Slaves don't have security.
[00:28:44.432 --> 00:28:48.715]  To the extent that you give up your liberty, to that extent you become a slave.
[00:28:49.375 --> 00:28:51.798]  And if you give up all of your liberty, you live in a prison.
[00:28:51.858 --> 00:28:53.000]  It's called maximum security.
[00:28:53.381 --> 00:28:56.725]  And so now, people have been told that for a long time.
[00:28:56.745 --> 00:28:58.908]  They need to trade off liberty for security.
[00:28:58.928 --> 00:29:02.974]  And so, many people buy that because they've been propagandized about that for so long.
[00:29:03.394 --> 00:29:06.679]  But they haven't been propagandized about this privacy issue for very long.
[00:29:07.622 --> 00:29:17.368]  And the encouraging thing about this is that this is across all seven political categorizations of the Pew Research Center that took this poll.
[00:29:17.969 --> 00:29:20.110]  And look at these different ones.
[00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:22.572]  Now the highest one was the hard-pressed skeptics.
[00:29:22.612 --> 00:29:22.912]  That was 83%.
[00:29:23.392 --> 00:29:30.937]  The lowest ones were tied for the next generation left and the faith and family left.
[00:29:31.538 --> 00:29:33.239]  They only agreed at 66%.
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:41.003]  I thought that we all, I thought the left was unified, that we all have a right to privacy.
[00:29:41.843 --> 00:29:44.745]  Oh, I'm sorry, that's just what they mean when they say abortions.
[00:29:45.125 --> 00:29:52.708]  They don't really want you to have real privacy, but at least even there, a majority, 66%, don't want to see that trade-off.
[00:29:52.989 --> 00:29:56.810]  We're going to be right back with more news and that review about America.
[00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:57.571]  Dinesh D'Souza.
[00:29:58.231 --> 00:30:01.216]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.157 --> 00:30:04.841]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.048 --> 00:30:13.030]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:17.212]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:30:17.432 --> 00:30:20.833]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:30:21.093 --> 00:30:23.995]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:30:24.135 --> 00:30:31.518]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:30:31.718 --> 00:30:35.360]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:39.862]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:30:40.042 --> 00:30:45.965]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:30:46.005 --> 00:30:49.766]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:30:49.946 --> 00:30:52.488]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:30:52.688 --> 00:30:54.028]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:30:54.188 --> 00:30:55.429]  It's time to take action.
[00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:57.270]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:31:10.265 --> 00:31:11.306]  In the near future.
[00:31:11.606 --> 00:31:15.748]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[00:31:16.088 --> 00:31:17.109]  Security, alert.
[00:31:17.309 --> 00:31:19.050]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:22.872]  Analysis, InfoWars, building independent media operations.
[00:31:22.892 --> 00:31:27.875]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:31:27.915 --> 00:31:30.396]  Crime directive, discredit Alex Jones.
[00:31:30.496 --> 00:31:33.278]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:31:33.338 --> 00:31:36.399]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:31:36.579 --> 00:31:38.821]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:31:38.881 --> 00:31:39.601]  These people are a
[00:31:39.821 --> 00:31:41.802]  They're never going to stop.
[00:31:42.002 --> 00:31:49.966]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[00:31:50.106 --> 00:32:03.612]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:32:03.732 --> 00:32:05.252]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[00:32:05.272 --> 00:32:06.013]  You can feel it.
[00:32:08.917 --> 00:32:13.658]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[00:32:13.878 --> 00:32:16.978]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[00:32:17.238 --> 00:32:19.059]  She's just not the woman I married.
[00:32:19.339 --> 00:32:21.279]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[00:32:21.499 --> 00:32:22.959]  Does this seem familiar?
[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.200]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:27.800]  If so, consider this.
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:36.962]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[00:32:37.342 --> 00:32:43.371]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.
[00:32:43.732 --> 00:32:45.354]  Forget synthetic chemicals.
[00:32:45.774 --> 00:32:53.426]  Super Female Vitality brings forward key herbs specifically chosen for women's biology without the use of phony additives.

[00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:02.449]  Live life healthy.
[00:33:02.629 --> 00:33:03.609]  I see the red moon rising
[00:33:18.649 --> 00:33:24.785]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:25.146 --> 00:33:26.991]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:33.024 --> 00:33:34.585]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:34.605 --> 00:33:37.007]  Now, many of us see a bad moon rising.
[00:33:37.067 --> 00:33:38.508]  We see this collapse of the border.
[00:33:38.989 --> 00:33:42.111]  We understand what that's going to mean economically to the country.
[00:33:42.672 --> 00:33:50.218]  As I just reported, Obama's new bill is not just a 12-cent hike, it is a 67% increase in highway taxes.
[00:33:50.778 --> 00:33:58.244]  Much of that money is going to be redistributed to crony capitalists, to a kind of fascism, but it's also going to be reallocated
[00:33:58.704 --> 00:34:04.487]  To things other than roads and bridges for the cars and the drivers who are paying those highway taxes.
[00:34:04.507 --> 00:34:12.732]  A lot of that's going to be redirected to these pet projects, these crony capitalism projects to put in light rail.
[00:34:13.372 --> 00:34:16.334]  And of course they're also going up on student loans by 20%.
[00:34:16.974 --> 00:34:18.775]  Those are just some of the economic issues.
[00:34:18.895 --> 00:34:20.376]  Things are accelerating.
[00:34:20.976 --> 00:34:24.421]  Alex Jones is going to be in the show live in studio.
[00:34:24.461 --> 00:34:34.033]  He's going to go over some of the news that's coming up and I know he's going to have a lot to say about this new California bill that would allow police to confiscate guns just based on accusation.
[00:34:34.734 --> 00:34:37.437]  Shredding the whole idea of due process.
[00:34:38.598 --> 00:34:47.347]  Now, last night we went to see the new film by Dinesh D'Souza, America, and I want to give you a little bit more about my take on that.
[00:34:47.387 --> 00:34:54.654]  But before I do, I want to let you know that this hour of the Alex Jones Show is brought to you by our sponsor, My Patriot Supply.
[00:34:55.235 --> 00:35:01.641]  As we look at the pending economic collapse, the collapse of the border, the soaring meat prices, the soaring prices at the gas pump,
[00:35:02.262 --> 00:35:04.082]  It's clear there's no longer time to wait.
[00:35:04.523 --> 00:35:05.983]  You need to start getting prepared today.
[00:35:06.363 --> 00:35:08.123]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com.
[00:35:08.163 --> 00:35:10.404]  Check out their complete line of preparedness products.
[00:35:10.924 --> 00:35:14.965]  My Patriot Supply is the home of the Patriot Pantry line of emergency food storage.
[00:35:15.505 --> 00:35:18.466]  If you don't have food, you're no threat to the new world order.
[00:35:18.486 --> 00:35:22.587]  They're counting on you to be ever-dependent slaves to their system of control.
[00:35:22.627 --> 00:35:23.507]  But you can fight back.
[00:35:23.927 --> 00:35:30.009]  You can establish independence for yourself, for your family, by securing your own private supply of storable food.
[00:35:30.549 --> 00:35:33.270]  There's no better way to prepare than this Patriot-owned company.

[00:35:52.139 --> 00:35:54.780]  Now, as I was just saying, we have a film review from last night.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:58.782]  The official release of Dinesh D'Souza's America is today.
[00:35:59.907 --> 00:36:02.470]  Several of us with the Infowar crew went there last night.
[00:36:03.071 --> 00:36:12.442]  Jakari Jackson, Kit Daniels and I, Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, my son, we gave our take on it on an iPhone just as we stepped outside the movie theater.
[00:36:12.562 --> 00:36:13.824]  As I've thought about it more,
[00:36:14.972 --> 00:36:17.415]  I wanted to kind of... I gave it a thumbs up.
[00:36:17.836 --> 00:36:18.237]  I like it.
[00:36:18.357 --> 00:36:19.759]  I would recommend that you go to see it.
[00:36:19.879 --> 00:36:22.202]  We need to support independent film.
[00:36:22.482 --> 00:36:29.572]  We need to support a variety of voices who are going to give us a different take on things than the Michael Moores of the world, than Hollywood.
[00:36:29.612 --> 00:36:32.295]  We need that other conversation in there.
[00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:35.413]  And there's some very good things about this movie.
[00:36:35.453 --> 00:36:37.695]  I thought the production values were excellent.
[00:36:37.816 --> 00:36:42.301]  As Darren McBreen said, the Fox News crowd is going to love their worldview on it.
[00:36:42.361 --> 00:36:44.104]  It's very Republican, very GOP.
[00:36:44.784 --> 00:36:50.952]  But just like religion and politics, there's a lot of disagreement that people are going to have about a lot of different issues.
[00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:58.451]  One of the strongest things that he had in there was his take on Saul Alinsky, his exposé of Saul Alinsky.
[00:36:58.491 --> 00:36:59.312]  That's very good.
[00:36:59.792 --> 00:37:14.275]  And if you've got somebody in school, if you've got family or children who are in college or somebody that's even in government school, his take on Howard Zinn and Howard Zinn's revisionist history of America
[00:37:14.915 --> 00:37:17.637]  That was really the main thrust of the movie in my opinion.
[00:37:18.157 --> 00:37:23.480]  It was really kind of the academic world in which Dinesh D'Souza really kind of stays for the most part.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.421]  And so that was what he was most concerned about.
[00:37:25.461 --> 00:37:33.566]  And that was how American history was being changed by Howard Zinn and others to try to make us collectively feel guilty.
[00:37:33.746 --> 00:37:38.049]  Because that's a way that they can essentially take down our system of government.
[00:37:38.469 --> 00:37:40.170]  And at that level he's very right.
[00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:42.372]  That whole premise is a very strong premise.
[00:37:43.072 --> 00:37:50.096]  We don't want to destroy America and rebuild this socialist paradise, and that's the motivation with Howard Zinn and many of these other people.
[00:37:50.757 --> 00:37:55.000]  But I think that's also a weakness of the film, in that it ignores the police state.
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.601]  It ignores what George Bush did.
[00:37:57.621 --> 00:38:01.744]  When he looks at these various criticisms from the academic left,
[00:38:02.344 --> 00:38:16.393]  When he looks at the criticisms about slavery, when he looks at the criticisms about how the Indians were treated, when he looks at the criticisms about what we're doing with the military-industrial complex, his defense, I thought, really fell flat.
[00:38:17.334 --> 00:38:20.536]  When he talks about slavery, it was essentially talking about how
[00:38:21.894 --> 00:38:27.599]  The other countries of the world, historically, and all other countries have had slaves.
[00:38:27.839 --> 00:38:29.741]  That just doesn't do it.
[00:38:30.281 --> 00:38:32.343]  It's not enough to say everybody does it.
[00:38:33.745 --> 00:38:38.429]  We need to condemn it without any reservations, categorically.
[00:38:38.789 --> 00:38:39.730]  And we need to move on.
[00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:44.754]  Where he got it right were in quotes like from Bono where he talked about the
[00:38:45.899 --> 00:38:47.041]  Ideals of America.
[00:38:47.101 --> 00:38:49.384]  That America was essentially an idea.
[00:38:49.945 --> 00:38:51.908]  And that's what we need to take away from the founders.
[00:38:51.968 --> 00:39:00.180]  The founders had a wonderful idea of building a country based on individual liberty and certain inalienable rights.
[00:39:01.101 --> 00:39:03.243]  Now, they were less than perfect people.
[00:39:03.443 --> 00:39:05.364]  There was hypocrisy in what they did.
[00:39:05.665 --> 00:39:07.226]  There was contradiction in what they did.
[00:39:07.666 --> 00:39:09.668]  We don't need to make excuses for that.
[00:39:09.728 --> 00:39:12.590]  We can condemn that and still embrace the ideal.
[00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:18.054]  Part of what they did was to give us a system of government of checks and balances.
[00:39:18.654 --> 00:39:22.097]  That came from their Christian understanding of the fallen nature of man.
[00:39:22.477 --> 00:39:23.938]  That man is inherently evil.
[00:39:24.279 --> 00:39:28.342]  Because we're not angels, we cannot give absolute power to people in government.
[00:39:29.002 --> 00:39:41.250]  And so they created a system of checks and balances, both within the central government and outside of the central government, against the central government, to balance it in multiple ways because the thing they were most concerned about was consolidation.
[00:39:41.951 --> 00:39:58.061]  Now the tact that Dinesh D'Souza and many conservatives take, and this is what I didn't talk about in the review, is to counterbalance these founders who owned slaves at the beginning of the republic, to try to counter them by making Abraham Lincoln into some kind of a
[00:39:59.383 --> 00:40:02.286]  A liberating saint, to do a hagiography on him.
[00:40:02.366 --> 00:40:08.372]  And there was far too much naive stuff in there about Abraham Lincoln.
[00:40:08.412 --> 00:40:14.219]  If you want to know about Abraham Lincoln, look up the real Abraham Lincoln by Thomas DiLorenzo or Lincoln the Man.
[00:40:14.259 --> 00:40:19.364]  There's many historical books that point out what happened during the Civil War.
[00:40:20.345 --> 00:40:22.267]  Lincoln destroyed due process.
[00:40:22.307 --> 00:40:23.829]  He gave us an income tax.
[00:40:23.869 --> 00:40:24.910]  He gave us a draft.
[00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:27.452]  We had some of the biggest riots we've ever had in this country.
[00:40:27.953 --> 00:40:32.457]  He was opposed by many of the abolitionists who had supported abolition.
[00:40:32.477 --> 00:40:34.900]  They opposed what Abraham Lincoln was doing.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:41.947]  That does not balance or justify what happened with the slaves from the founders.
[00:40:42.447 --> 00:40:42.908]  We don't
[00:40:44.025 --> 00:40:49.669]  We don't have to rely on having some kind of a saint replace these initial founders.
[00:40:49.869 --> 00:40:59.096]  We need to understand that the system itself needs to be reformed in some areas, but it's not bad based on evil men or less than perfect men.
[00:40:59.716 --> 00:41:05.198]  And so we don't need to create a false version of Abraham Lincoln in order to move this country forward.
[00:41:05.618 --> 00:41:07.198]  That was my biggest criticism of it.
[00:41:07.598 --> 00:41:18.221]  I was very disappointed to see just the lockstep embrace of what happened in Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam, all these continual wars that we've had after World War II.
[00:41:19.002 --> 00:41:26.744]  Not recognizing this is being driven by the military-industrial complex to say that we didn't make any money off of Vietnam, that we didn't make any money off of Iraq.
[00:41:27.384 --> 00:41:30.246]  No, there were people who made a lot of money off of those wars.
[00:41:30.727 --> 00:41:32.648]  They're called the military-industrial complex.
[00:41:33.129 --> 00:41:36.371]  We don't need to excuse it based on that.
[00:41:36.451 --> 00:41:40.275]  Those were inexcusable lies that were told to the American public.
[00:41:40.315 --> 00:41:46.179]  A lot of people who were compartmentalized went and fought in those wars for very noble reasons, but they were lied to.
[00:41:47.233 --> 00:41:57.224]  We just had a congressman come out and say that we need to stop talking about how mistakes were made and talk about how we were lied to.
[00:41:57.324 --> 00:41:58.465]  Dennis Kucinich said that.
[00:41:58.745 --> 00:42:01.688]  He said that in the Huffington Post on the very next day.
[00:42:02.449 --> 00:42:05.411]  Harry Reid comes out and said, mistakes were made on Iraq.
[00:42:05.832 --> 00:42:07.733]  No, we need to own up to our mistakes.
[00:42:07.753 --> 00:42:10.555]  We need to own up to the fact that we were lied to about Iraq.
[00:42:10.916 --> 00:42:20.843]  We need to own up to the fact that slavery was wrong, not make any excuses for it, and understand that even the people who gave us that system of government, the founders, were less than perfect.
[00:42:21.103 --> 00:42:25.227]  But that doesn't take away from the ideas of individual liberty and freedom.
[00:42:25.467 --> 00:42:26.648]  When I went to Bilderberg,
[00:42:27.697 --> 00:42:29.338]  And was talking to people there in Copenhagen.
[00:42:29.358 --> 00:42:37.722]  We were talking about how the Constitution had essentially been just a dead letter, a piece of paper, according to George Bush, as he's reported to have said.
[00:42:38.142 --> 00:42:40.263]  It's just a blank piece of paper.
[00:42:41.667 --> 00:42:50.271]  But they said you have something very important that we don't have in Denmark and that is a tradition, a history of individual liberty.
[00:42:50.531 --> 00:42:56.094]  You have a system of government that was based on that and that's something that's very important that we need to hang on to.
[00:42:56.154 --> 00:43:10.862]  So I would still recommend that you go see the film but I would also recommend that you spend a little bit of time and learn about Abraham Lincoln and not try to justify what the wrongs that other people have done by creating a false hagiography about Abraham Lincoln.
[00:43:12.062 --> 00:43:13.645]  Now there's a story that's breaking today.
[00:43:13.665 --> 00:43:19.035]  HHS bars a congressman in Oklahoma from seeing immigrant children.
[00:43:20.069 --> 00:43:23.931]  As we've talked about many times, there is an opacity about what's going on.
[00:43:23.971 --> 00:43:25.612]  They're trying to keep this secret.
[00:43:25.972 --> 00:43:28.373]  They're barring even congressmen from going in.
[00:43:28.673 --> 00:43:31.354]  This is Jim Bridenstine, Republican of Oklahoma.
[00:43:31.374 --> 00:43:32.835]  He said, what are they trying to hide?
[00:43:33.375 --> 00:43:36.036]  Do they not want the children to speak with members of Congress?
[00:43:36.576 --> 00:43:40.658]  As a Navy pilot, I've been involved in operations countering illicit human trafficking.
[00:43:41.139 --> 00:43:44.740]  I would like to know to whom these children are being released.
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.301]  That's a very good point.
[00:43:47.136 --> 00:43:51.318]  Are they being held and released into a human trafficking operation?
[00:43:51.338 --> 00:43:52.938]  Because that happens in America as well.
[00:43:53.539 --> 00:43:55.839]  He said the security guards would not even let him in.
[00:43:55.859 --> 00:44:00.181]  He says, what kind of a country do we have when even a congressman can't see what's going on?
[00:44:00.281 --> 00:44:04.343]  And that's what we ran into when our reporters went down to the Nancy Pelosi
[00:44:05.123 --> 00:44:07.324]  Photo op that happened this last Saturday.
[00:44:07.384 --> 00:44:12.967]  Here's a clip of what happened to Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs as Michael Savage talks about it.
[00:44:13.147 --> 00:44:13.907]  What the real media is doing.
[00:44:13.927 --> 00:44:14.428]  I'm a citizen's son.
[00:44:14.568 --> 00:44:15.428]  I believe in America.
[00:44:15.528 --> 00:44:16.609]  I believe in the rule of law.
[00:44:16.969 --> 00:44:17.729]  I believe in borders.
[00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:18.530]  I believe in language.
[00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:19.350]  I believe in culture.
[00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:29.155]  And I am sick and tired of seeing illegitimate, illegal aliens running all over my country and running all over Congress and rioting and screaming for what they want.
[00:44:29.895 --> 00:44:30.596]  Why don't we riot?
[00:44:30.716 --> 00:44:34.099]  Why don't we go to Durbin's office and tell him what we think of him?
[00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:41.887]  It would only take small groups of 50 people, at any time, to start screaming at any congressman or senator, wherever they may go.
[00:44:42.588 --> 00:44:44.130]  Groups of 50, that's all it would take.
[00:44:44.951 --> 00:44:46.312]  You'd get your way, I can guarantee you.
[00:44:46.332 --> 00:44:47.393]  I didn't say hurt anybody.
[00:44:48.494 --> 00:44:49.876]  That's the last thing you want to do.
[00:44:51.443 --> 00:45:03.953]  If they'll let illegal aliens break into Congress and start screaming and then spewing hatred, demanding amnesty for 30 million illegal aliens, why don't you let Durbin know, Feinstein know, Boxer know, Pelosi know?
[00:45:05.514 --> 00:45:10.358]  You know, someone tried this from, it was from Infowars over the weekend.
[00:45:10.378 --> 00:45:11.699]  Oh, we have a wonderful soundbite.
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:14.041]  One of their reporters tried to talk to Ms.
[00:45:14.121 --> 00:45:15.302]  Pelosi, the imperious.
[00:45:16.023 --> 00:45:18.304]  They wouldn't let her near, they wouldn't let him near her.
[00:45:19.093 --> 00:45:21.094]  They said he wasn't a designated journalist.
[00:45:21.114 --> 00:45:22.114]  Do we have that soundbite?
[00:45:22.134 --> 00:45:22.955]  I know we do.
[00:45:23.775 --> 00:45:29.217]  He went up to her, and it's Joe Biggs from Prison Planet in clip number two.
[00:45:29.257 --> 00:45:29.837]  Listen to this.
[00:45:30.398 --> 00:45:30.938]  And here we are.
[00:45:30.978 --> 00:45:31.998]  That's the question I asked.
[00:45:32.098 --> 00:45:33.239]  I didn't get much of a response.
[00:45:33.259 --> 00:45:36.940]  She kind of put her head down and rushed out of here in her convoy.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.241]  But it's kind of funny the spot she picked.
[00:45:39.281 --> 00:45:41.102]  If you look, we got the swing set.
[00:45:41.122 --> 00:45:45.304]  There's a school in the background because, like she said during the conference, that it's all about the children.
[00:45:46.064 --> 00:45:48.305]  This humanitarian crisis is all about the children.
[00:45:48.545 --> 00:45:56.969]  But when I spoke to the Vice President of the Border Patrol Unit two days ago, he said that the cartels were using these children as a beard.
[00:45:57.809 --> 00:46:03.232]  And what was happening was we're pulling these Border Patrol agents off our borders and allowing these
[00:46:04.794 --> 00:46:08.935]  You can see that full clip of Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs up on our YouTube channel.
[00:46:09.776 --> 00:46:14.157]  That's what happens when we go and try to confront people and ask real questions.
[00:46:14.197 --> 00:46:15.057]  She had a photo op.
[00:46:15.117 --> 00:46:16.578]  I don't think she even took questions.
[00:46:16.938 --> 00:46:18.919]  And that's what outraged Michael Savage.
[00:46:19.299 --> 00:46:20.279]  And it's even worse than that.
[00:46:20.319 --> 00:46:25.621]  We see congressmen who are not allowed to have access, who are not allowed to know what's happening to these children.
[00:46:26.121 --> 00:46:29.562]  Are they being turned over to a child trafficking operation?
[00:46:30.142 --> 00:46:42.964]  He says any member of Congress, this is the congressman from Oklahoma, Jim Bridenstine, he said any member of Congress should have the legal authority to visit a federal youth detention facility without waiting three weeks.
[00:46:43.484 --> 00:46:45.665]  Now joining us in the studio is Alex Jones.
[00:46:45.705 --> 00:46:46.525]  Welcome back, Alex.
[00:46:47.005 --> 00:46:47.645]  Great to have you here.
[00:46:47.905 --> 00:46:50.686]  David, I took off a week to spend time with a family.
[00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:58.023]  You know, over the years I tend to not ever take off and then I get more and more frantic on air and more and more wild.
[00:46:59.724 --> 00:47:01.785]  Which I guess has its place, but it's good for me to take off.
[00:47:02.265 --> 00:47:07.708]  So I did take off and it gives you a lot of retrospective, but also you can pull back and see the big picture.
[00:47:08.488 --> 00:47:12.590]  And so I've got a lot of important things to talk about in the second and third hour today.
[00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:23.215]  Again, my flight back into the United States was canceled once it got into Houston last night, the flight from Houston back in to Austin once I got back into the U.S.
[00:47:23.755 --> 00:47:26.156]  And so that was canceled by about one in the morning.
[00:47:26.176 --> 00:47:28.757]  So I got up about five in the morning and then that was held
[00:47:28.797 --> 00:47:29.097]  I think so.
[00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:54.713]  Realize why this has been done and how we turn it around.
[00:47:55.154 --> 00:48:06.083]  So I've got some pretty heavy issues that obviously dovetails with exactly what you're covering here today, because what we're witnessing is tyranny.
[00:48:06.964 --> 00:48:13.489]  And it's now reached a point, as we warned people for so long it would, where the bottom falls out and there's no restraint.
[00:48:14.421 --> 00:48:27.678]  And we are now going to see, as the criminology and psychology shows for thousands of years, before they had the term psychology out of Germany or Russia or England, thousands of years ago, rulers and social engineers knew the systems that control populations.
[00:48:28.138 --> 00:48:32.103]  We also know the types of elites that are out there throughout history and how they manifest.
[00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:34.451]  They start acting out.
[00:48:34.871 --> 00:48:39.997]  A psychopath that's killed 10, 15, 20 people starts getting wilder and wilder, taunting the police.
[00:48:40.677 --> 00:48:41.918]  They do that a lot.
[00:48:42.819 --> 00:48:43.920]  Operating out in the open.
[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:47.144]  Instead of killing one person every few months, it starts being two or three a weekend.
[00:48:48.145 --> 00:48:51.268]  Sending them clues so that they can almost want to get caught.
[00:48:51.808 --> 00:48:53.390]  And that's what we see happening with these people.
[00:48:54.151 --> 00:48:54.471]  Absolutely.
[00:48:54.491 --> 00:48:56.853]  I mean, it's a fact that a bunch of these kids are mules.
[00:48:57.814 --> 00:48:59.916]  It's a fact they've been using bases forever for drug dealing.
[00:49:01.137 --> 00:49:07.042]  It's a fact that they, every time we try to go to a press conference, we show up and the military
[00:49:08.177 --> 00:49:13.462]  Threatens our reporters, and says we'll take your military ID away if you keep coming to these.
[00:49:13.482 --> 00:49:16.085]  And we're like, here's the press release, there's a press conference.
[00:49:16.285 --> 00:49:17.306]  But it isn't a press conference.
[00:49:17.626 --> 00:49:20.289]  They have these things you notice on federal reservations now.
[00:49:20.509 --> 00:49:20.709]  Yeah.
[00:49:20.829 --> 00:49:23.212]  The Congresswomen, criminals like Pelosi.
[00:49:23.232 --> 00:49:24.933]  I mean, this is an arch terrorist criminal.
[00:49:25.394 --> 00:49:26.975]  We're literally destroying the country right now.
[00:49:27.616 --> 00:49:29.718]  And then saying we're racist and we don't want open borders.
[00:49:30.038 --> 00:49:30.979]  No one has open borders.
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:32.661]  If we bordered Switzerland,
[00:49:34.011 --> 00:49:36.993]  They wouldn't be letting us in because we don't have the wealth and things they have.
[00:49:37.913 --> 00:49:39.374]  And they wouldn't want us on their welfare system.
[00:49:40.335 --> 00:49:45.678]  This is having one of the most failed countries in the world bordering us with the whole world going into depression.
[00:49:45.698 --> 00:49:49.640]  I mean Latin America, the Caribbean, the crime rates have more than doubled on average.
[00:49:50.833 --> 00:49:53.296]  It's all over the news, the travel advisories.
[00:49:53.856 --> 00:49:55.117]  I just came back from the Caribbean.
[00:49:56.578 --> 00:50:04.285]  And even in the places that have been some of the better areas with low crime, I talked to the police and they said, no, we just don't put it in the newspaper.
[00:50:04.345 --> 00:50:04.765]  Watch out.
[00:50:05.826 --> 00:50:09.328]  And that was in, well, I'll talk about it coming up later.
[00:50:10.068 --> 00:50:14.111]  It's just that the world is being artificially collapsed right now.
[00:50:14.971 --> 00:50:16.052]  And we're going to be discussing that.
[00:50:16.652 --> 00:50:20.634]  Come back and put some bookends on this in this next segment and five into the next hour, David.
[00:50:20.994 --> 00:50:21.875]  And then I'm going to come in.
[00:50:22.115 --> 00:50:24.756]  I'll probably do some overdrive today as well.
[00:50:25.757 --> 00:50:27.518]  We may have shuffled Lord Monton tomorrow.
[00:50:27.558 --> 00:50:28.118]  I'm not sure.
[00:50:28.138 --> 00:50:30.859]  And is Mr. Dent still on?
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:31.320]  Yes.
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:32.561]  Yes, okay.
[00:50:32.921 --> 00:50:36.726]  So, again, I literally just took a shower because I didn't have my toiletries.
[00:50:36.746 --> 00:50:37.847]  That was in the check-in luggage.
[00:50:38.288 --> 00:50:41.051]  So I also had to run home and, you know, shave and things.
[00:50:41.091 --> 00:50:46.237]  I was sure I was killing people on the plane with bad breath today, this morning, and everybody else around me.
[00:50:46.257 --> 00:50:47.138]  But we're going to come back.
[00:50:47.339 --> 00:50:48.820]  It's just there's so much to talk about.
[00:50:49.341 --> 00:50:58.845]  We can look at all the window dressing articles and the latest shoe to drop, but it's the larger societal de-evolution we're at that we'll be talking about coming up.
[00:50:59.145 --> 00:51:07.729]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, back in the saddle, late but still here, with David Knight, who's done a superlative job, and we want to thank all the sponsors and listeners and the great crew as well.
[00:51:07.749 --> 00:51:08.149]  Stay with us.
[00:51:08.909 --> 00:51:13.813]  Gentlemen, in search of a million-dollar smile that'll make them take notice, I mean really get their attention?
[00:51:14.193 --> 00:51:15.114]  Then get the mud!
[00:51:15.554 --> 00:51:16.535]  My Magic Mud!
[00:51:16.955 --> 00:51:21.499]  The fluoride-free whitener with no chemicals, additives, GMOs, or bad taste.
[00:51:21.919 --> 00:51:22.880]  And safe to swallow.
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:28.924]  My Magic Mud detoxifies, reduces sensitivity, cleans and strengthens your teeth while it whitens.
[00:51:29.324 --> 00:51:31.746]  Comes as a powder for pure whitening power.

[00:52:07.802 --> 00:52:10.364]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:10.625 --> 00:52:15.509]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:15.749 --> 00:52:23.597]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:23.877 --> 00:52:28.182]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:28.382 --> 00:52:32.226]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:32.366 --> 00:52:38.092]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:38.332 --> 00:52:41.115]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:41.496 --> 00:52:46.621]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[00:53:37.103 --> 00:53:38.124]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:53:38.204 --> 00:53:42.547]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:53:42.707 --> 00:53:48.330]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:51.773]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:53:51.993 --> 00:53:54.554]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[00:54:23.962 --> 00:54:25.323]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:25.403 --> 00:54:26.084]  I'm David Knight.
[00:54:26.424 --> 00:54:29.647]  Alex is going to be joining us in the next hour, live here in the studio.
[00:54:29.667 --> 00:54:35.552]  He's going to tell you what he's been doing, relaxing, taking some time with his family, as we all need to do.
[00:54:36.093 --> 00:54:41.178]  And he's going to have a lot to say, I'm sure, about the massive developments that have happened.
[00:54:41.878 --> 00:54:51.601]  In the last week or so, the collapse of the border, now this new bill in California that's going to do away with any due process for anyone who owns a gun.
[00:54:51.661 --> 00:54:56.642]  You can just have them seized, your rights terminated by mere accusation.
[00:54:57.242 --> 00:54:59.783]  And not even just by a psychiatrist.
[00:54:59.963 --> 00:55:03.225]  But it can be done by some family member who doesn't like you.
[00:55:03.606 --> 00:55:03.946]  Anyone.
[00:55:03.986 --> 00:55:10.410]  You don't have a right to a real trial and we see that happening in area after area after area.
[00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:13.052]  Another story up on Infowars.com.
[00:55:13.612 --> 00:55:20.637]  Privacy and Civil Liberties Board is mostly unconcerned about PRISM or backbone tapping by the NSA.
[00:55:20.997 --> 00:55:27.042]  Now this is an organization, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, PCLOB.
[00:55:27.842 --> 00:55:38.190]  Now, if you look up this organization on the web, you see that they describe themselves as an independent bipartisan agency within the executive branch.
[00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:43.474]  Well, they criticize the 215 bulk data collection efforts, but now
[00:55:44.275 --> 00:55:52.903]  On this 702 program, they are essentially saying it's legal, it's constitutional, and it's effective as a counter-terrorism tool.
[00:55:53.264 --> 00:55:53.924]  No, it's not.
[00:55:54.365 --> 00:55:55.426]  It's not any of those things.
[00:55:55.486 --> 00:56:04.154]  It's not constitutional, it's not legal, and it's not effective to have this PRISM program as well as Dragnet backbone tapping.
[00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:22.926]  You're not going to see the government agencies stand up and back our individual liberties, but people are realizing that that's exactly what is happening, is that we're losing our privacy on just the promise of security.
[00:56:22.946 --> 00:56:24.126]  A very
[00:56:26.327 --> 00:56:55.547]  Encouraging report was one that I just talked about where we had the majority of people in seven different demographic areas said that they would not trade their privacy for security and of course the lowest one was 66% with a couple of self-described left viewing demographics but across the board it went up to 88% and it was every one of them it was a majority of them realized that this was a false promise that we were being given.
[00:56:56.267 --> 00:56:58.910]  This is a corrupt, hypocritical government.
[00:56:58.950 --> 00:57:07.157]  We see the border collapsing at the same time they continue to do these rollouts internally, spying on us, handling us with the TSA.
[00:57:07.538 --> 00:57:15.665]  Now we've got another incident, and that is Congress people are now no longer going to have to report travel that is paid for by private groups.
[00:57:15.725 --> 00:57:19.386]  Yes, this is something that was done behind closed doors without a public announcement.
[00:57:19.406 --> 00:57:21.567]  It was done by the House Ethics Committee.
[00:57:22.007 --> 00:57:26.229]  They reversed more than three decades of precedent where it was counted as a gift.
[00:57:26.469 --> 00:57:42.315]  Now at the same time they're doing that, WorldNetDaily points out that the feds are doing gunpoint searches of private planes to such an extent that one congressman is trying to, or rather a senator, Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, is trying to stop that.
[00:57:42.375 --> 00:57:44.076]  He's putting in a pilot's bill of rights.
[00:57:44.736 --> 00:57:46.257]  We all have a Bill of Rights.
[00:57:46.317 --> 00:57:48.417]  We don't need a pilot's Bill of Rights.
[00:57:48.517 --> 00:57:50.718]  We need to enforce the Bill of Rights.
[00:57:51.158 --> 00:57:53.439]  The Fourth Amendment needs to be enforced.
[00:57:53.479 --> 00:57:55.680]  Let's do that for everybody, not just a few people.
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:57.621]  But that shows the hypocrisy, doesn't it?
[00:57:58.181 --> 00:58:03.843]  Where you've got Congress now saying that they can accept flights to anywhere, and it's no longer an ethics issue.
[00:58:04.143 --> 00:58:08.265]  But meanwhile, anybody with a private plane is going to get gunpoint searches.
[00:58:09.065 --> 00:58:12.027]  That's what we see rolling out as this tyranny is rolling out.
[00:58:12.588 --> 00:58:21.595]  One of the ways that you can support this operation, one of the ways that you can get this information out there and help to get people on is with the Mulan Lave belt buckles.
[00:58:21.695 --> 00:58:22.956]  We've got 500 of them.
[00:58:22.976 --> 00:58:23.937]  It's a limited edition.
[00:58:24.157 --> 00:58:26.899]  They're not going to last long at the rate that they're moving right now.
[00:58:26.919 --> 00:58:27.680]  A beautiful buckle.
[00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:29.861]  It's kind of based on that t-shirt design that we have.
[00:58:30.322 --> 00:58:33.144]  And just like I was saying about the Dinesh D'Souza movie,
[00:58:33.644 --> 00:58:36.266]  It's a way to support the alternative media.
[00:58:36.706 --> 00:58:38.668]  It's a way to increase debate.
[00:58:38.988 --> 00:58:41.230]  It's something that you can talk to people about.
[00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:43.431]  They're going to ask you, what's your belt buckle about?
[00:58:43.451 --> 00:58:45.013]  They're going to be sold out in just a few weeks.
[00:58:45.353 --> 00:58:47.074]  So go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:47.114 --> 00:58:49.876]  We'll be right back after the break with Alex Jones live.
[00:58:49.896 --> 00:58:52.978]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:53.039 --> 00:58:54.840]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:59.094 --> 00:59:05.058]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:59:05.259 --> 00:59:09.461]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:59:09.822 --> 00:59:14.385]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:59:14.785 --> 00:59:17.407]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:59:17.727 --> 00:59:22.889]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:30.033]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:59:30.554 --> 00:59:34.336]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:59:34.696 --> 00:59:39.478]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:39.798 --> 00:59:40.659]  This is innovating.
[00:59:40.939 --> 00:59:48.221]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:59:48.241 --> 00:59:52.482]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[01:00:14.898 --> 01:00:19.063]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:19.744 --> 01:00:20.545]  You want answers?
[01:00:21.306 --> 01:00:22.207]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:22.868 --> 01:00:26.513]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.054 --> 01:00:31.119]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:34.884 --> 01:00:36.264]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:36.364 --> 01:00:37.125]  I'm David Knight.
[01:00:37.165 --> 01:00:41.446]  In this last segment that I'm going to be on, Alex is going to be joining us live in studio.
[01:00:41.486 --> 01:00:43.506]  He's back from his well-deserved vacation.
[01:00:44.026 --> 01:00:45.226]  He's got a lot to talk about.
[01:00:45.286 --> 01:00:55.789]  I know you're going to want to hear his take on what's happened in the last week with the collapse of the border, leading, as we've been telling you for a very long time, as Alex Jones has been telling you, leading to a kind of implosion.
[01:00:56.429 --> 01:00:58.011]  Overloading the entitlement system.
[01:00:58.091 --> 01:01:02.897]  This has been gamed by socialist planners for a very long time.
[01:01:02.917 --> 01:01:07.622]  They want to destroy the country economically so they can rebuild their socialist paradise.
[01:01:08.243 --> 01:01:10.485]  Now one of the articles that we had earlier this week
[01:01:11.206 --> 01:01:24.529]  Was the situation in Detroit where one of the richest areas in the country, as we've gutted the manufacturing there, is now declining into a kind of a third world state where people can't even pay their water bills.
[01:01:24.909 --> 01:01:27.169]  They're having their water cut off by the thousands.
[01:01:27.549 --> 01:01:34.691]  Now if you look at this article from the LA Times, if you look at this lady who's at the very top here, her name is Nicole Hill, she's holding up past due water bills.
[01:01:35.111 --> 01:01:45.938]  Now, one of the things that I didn't talk about, because I got on to how the socialists are working with the bankers to collapse economies here, just like they did in the socialist paradise of Venezuela with Hugo Chavez.
[01:01:46.279 --> 01:01:51.402]  They're bragging about how the bankers got 700% return on their investment in Bloomberg.
[01:01:51.742 --> 01:02:03.430]  You've got Barclays saying, even though the people there don't have water, even though they have to leave the country in order to get medicine, that their first responsibility is to pay their debt to the bankers.
[01:02:04.711 --> 01:02:10.597]  What I didn't talk about and what I meant to talk about the other day when I showed this was, what comes after the economic collapse?
[01:02:10.657 --> 01:02:13.479]  What are they going to rebuild on top of the ruins?
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:22.007]  Well, to give you a glimpse, let's look at this person here, Nicole Hill, who's the person that the LA Times uses essentially as the example of what's going on.
[01:02:22.628 --> 01:02:27.912]  She says, it's frightening because you think it's something that only happens somewhere in a third world country like Africa.
[01:02:28.633 --> 01:02:34.778]  She is a single mother who is studying Homeland Security at a local college.
[01:02:34.958 --> 01:02:36.459]  Do you see how this is breaking down?
[01:02:37.159 --> 01:02:38.901]  She's a Homeland Security major.
[01:02:39.841 --> 01:02:45.485]  Detroit has been collapsed by socialism into a decaying hulk of what it formerly was.
[01:02:46.266 --> 01:02:48.808]  The manufacturing jobs have been sent overseas.
[01:02:49.288 --> 01:02:51.710]  The people can't pay for their water bills, so what's left?
[01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:57.566]  They can study to become a part of the police surveillance state.
[01:02:58.327 --> 01:03:05.836]  It's Homeland Security that is running the tyranny internally in this country, that is collapsing the borders.
[01:03:06.077 --> 01:03:10.662]  It's Homeland Security that's doing that, and it's Homeland Security that these people are going to be working for.
[01:03:11.824 --> 01:03:14.085]  And Alex, did you want to say something on that?
[01:03:14.286 --> 01:03:14.706]  No, sir.
[01:03:14.786 --> 01:03:15.486]  I apologize.
[01:03:15.546 --> 01:03:16.827]  I'm just in here getting my notes ready.
[01:03:17.147 --> 01:03:18.068]  Okay, that's good.
[01:03:18.608 --> 01:03:22.070]  I know he's going to have a lot to say about that.
[01:03:22.110 --> 01:03:23.271]  I thought you were coming for the mic.
[01:03:23.771 --> 01:03:27.273]  But that's what they're going to build on the ruins of this country.
[01:03:27.834 --> 01:03:31.516]  We've seen David Petraeus talking about what comes after America.
[01:03:32.370 --> 01:03:34.432]  North America, the North American Union.
[01:03:34.472 --> 01:03:39.776]  We've seen Nancy Pelosi saying, we have a community north and south that just happens to have a border running through it.
[01:03:40.677 --> 01:03:46.962]  They are now making an established fact what they passed into law 20 years ago.
[01:03:47.783 --> 01:03:52.327]  And if you look at the NDAA, at indefinite detention without trial,
[01:03:53.177 --> 01:03:58.922]  Looking, changing, declaring the United States to be a war zone, saying that they're going to enact military law.
[01:03:59.343 --> 01:04:08.551]  They have done RECS 87, all of these different plans for decades, and now they're going to roll them out just like they're rolling out NAFTA.
[01:04:09.434 --> 01:04:14.758]  These people who are coming in from Central and South America, that is all part of the NAFTA plan.
[01:04:15.698 --> 01:04:17.920]  And that's what they're going to do with the police state.
[01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:20.241]  They enact the laws, they let them sit there for a while.
[01:04:20.341 --> 01:04:30.288]  If they had immediately started arresting people under the NDAA and holding them indefinitely without trial, if they had passed that law and started doing that right away, there would have been a massive resistance against it.
[01:04:30.868 --> 01:04:36.150]  As it was, Obama said, I'm going to sign it, but don't worry, I'm not really going to enforce it.
[01:04:36.770 --> 01:04:42.833]  If they had done the same thing with NAFTA, if they'd signed the trade agreement and then immediately collapsed the borders, people would have woken up.
[01:04:42.933 --> 01:04:44.673]  They let it sit there for decades.
[01:04:45.093 --> 01:04:46.294]  Now they're doing it.
[01:04:46.894 --> 01:04:48.915]  Alex is going to be in here in the next segment.
[01:04:48.955 --> 01:04:54.657]  He's going to be talking to Harry Dent about the economic situation that we're faced with here in the United States.
[01:04:55.337 --> 01:04:55.837]  Stay with us.
[01:04:55.857 --> 01:04:57.078]  We're going to be right back.
[01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:15.927]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:05:16.027 --> 01:05:18.189]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:23.475]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:05:23.655 --> 01:05:28.600]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:31.883]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:05:32.143 --> 01:05:36.007]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:05:36.207 --> 01:05:40.471]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:05:40.532 --> 01:05:50.561]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:05:50.781 --> 01:05:53.304]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:05:53.484 --> 01:06:01.530]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:05.652]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:06:09.448 --> 01:06:11.209]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grew.
[01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:18.714]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[01:06:19.174 --> 01:06:29.601]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[01:06:30.002 --> 01:06:39.228]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[01:06:39.968 --> 01:06:43.371]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[01:06:44.012 --> 01:06:47.495]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[01:06:47.795 --> 01:06:49.356]  Experience the new formula.
[01:06:49.857 --> 01:06:51.819]  Experience the ancient purity.
[01:06:52.419 --> 01:06:53.360]  Shield your family.
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.141]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:06:55.582 --> 01:06:57.624]  Available now at Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:58.744 --> 01:07:02.708]  X2 from Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:07:07.819 --> 01:07:09.740]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:17.983]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:07:18.103 --> 01:07:25.386]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:07:25.646 --> 01:07:29.908]  I just received my Male Vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[01:07:30.248 --> 01:07:40.413]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:07:40.873 --> 01:07:47.037]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:07:47.357 --> 01:07:49.578]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:07:49.598 --> 01:07:53.600]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and getting the day started.
[01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:55.341]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[01:07:55.701 --> 01:07:59.623]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.
[01:07:59.864 --> 01:08:06.807]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[01:08:10.570 --> 01:08:12.791]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:13.351 --> 01:08:16.153]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:28.473 --> 01:08:32.135]  Well, I only took off six days.
[01:08:33.696 --> 01:08:37.859]  And it feels like I've been gone a hundred years.
[01:08:37.879 --> 01:08:48.526]  And we have had emails flooding in, phone calls by the hundreds, thousands of emails, people all over YouTube, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com in the comments.
[01:08:48.886 --> 01:08:49.747]  Where is Alex?
[01:08:49.827 --> 01:08:50.627]  Where is Alex?
[01:08:50.687 --> 01:08:51.348]  Where is Alex?
[01:08:52.333 --> 01:09:00.416]  And I tell you, I am really touched by the fact that every time I take a few days off, it becomes a big deal with the wonderful listeners.
[01:09:01.056 --> 01:09:02.957]  And I'm extremely humbled by that.
[01:09:03.577 --> 01:09:04.257]  And I mean that.
[01:09:04.597 --> 01:09:05.818]  I'm extremely humbled by it.
[01:09:06.318 --> 01:09:12.560]  But I gotta say, a lot of folks I talk to, when I was even out of the country, miss it when I'm gone.
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:14.241]  People come up to me, hey, you're not on yesterday.
[01:09:14.261 --> 01:09:16.881]  I guess you're here, where I was in the Caribbean.
[01:09:16.901 --> 01:09:17.982]  I'll tell you about that coming up.
[01:09:18.874 --> 01:09:23.276]  But boy, David Knight and your crew are just doing a wonderful job.
[01:09:23.296 --> 01:09:27.957]  So, you know, used to we didn't like it when you were gone, and we still don't.
[01:09:28.357 --> 01:09:34.039]  But man, what a great crew you've got and what a great find you have in David Knight.
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:46.444]  But you know, David Knight, who filled in the last hour, because everybody I talk to, and of course the news is reporting on this as well, but everybody I talk to says the airlines are just a nightmare now.
[01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:51.192]  And it seems like the last year, every time I fly, it's totally screwed up.
[01:09:52.993 --> 01:09:54.734]  And this time was no different.
[01:09:55.274 --> 01:09:56.615]  And I'm not going to go into the whole story.
[01:09:56.735 --> 01:09:59.137]  All of you, I'm sure, have your own horror stories.
[01:09:59.737 --> 01:10:03.420]  It's just that this country is degenerating and degenerating fast.
[01:10:04.601 --> 01:10:14.047]  And when you go to Europe, or you go even to third world countries, in the Caribbean, and they're more free than the U.S.
[01:10:14.107 --> 01:10:16.489]  on so many fronts, it really freaks you out.
[01:10:18.203 --> 01:10:19.644]  At least it does from my perspective.
[01:10:22.447 --> 01:10:36.418]  And I've got a lot of mixed feelings concerning this, because on the one hand, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible things are happening.
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.562]  But on the other hand, incredibly good things are happening as well.
[01:10:42.083 --> 01:10:44.325]  The old saying is, it's got to get bad before it gets better.
[01:10:45.452 --> 01:10:46.833]  Or it's always darkest before the dawn.
[01:10:47.093 --> 01:10:50.977]  We call those cliches because people say them so much because it's true.
[01:10:53.219 --> 01:10:54.480]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:55.341]  It's true.
[01:10:59.184 --> 01:11:00.445]  Misery loves company.
[01:11:00.586 --> 01:11:01.086]  It's true.
[01:11:02.287 --> 01:11:05.730]  Governments, if they get big, will hurt you and hurt you bad.
[01:11:06.131 --> 01:11:06.551]  It's true.
[01:11:07.292 --> 01:11:09.694]  Government is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.
[01:11:10.054 --> 01:11:10.775]  George Washington.
[01:11:11.710 --> 01:11:17.336]  And America, somehow in the last 60 years, got to the point of thinking, no, no, no, all that is not true.
[01:11:17.717 --> 01:11:21.581]  It's crazy to not want to have a giant government that runs your life.
[01:11:22.021 --> 01:11:25.105]  It's crazy to think that government might do something wrong.
[01:11:25.505 --> 01:11:25.785]  Why?
[01:11:26.026 --> 01:11:26.867]  Keep the faith!
[01:11:28.544 --> 01:11:36.110]  There's John Kerry and Hillary Clinton and Obama and Michelle, but also Hollande and Cameron.
[01:11:36.210 --> 01:11:40.713]  I mean, you look at their speeches, because I look at hundreds of news articles a day, conservatively.
[01:11:41.313 --> 01:11:42.294]  Let's be honest.
[01:11:42.674 --> 01:11:47.118]  Five hundred to six hundred articles I look at a day, maybe a hundred I read.
[01:11:51.181 --> 01:11:51.981]  I'm a news junkie.
[01:11:52.382 --> 01:11:55.804]  But I'm sure you're seeing this too, but these are public speeches.
[01:11:55.824 --> 01:11:56.625]  It's not like it's hidden.
[01:11:57.401 --> 01:12:07.767]  Where they're saying, keep the faith, it's gonna get better, government loves you, government's the answer, don't listen to people that say that tyranny's right around the corner, and that government's some sinister force, it's a force of good.
[01:12:09.548 --> 01:12:20.314]  No, the truth is, anything big and unaccountable will manifest the worst traits in humanity, and will wreck civilizations, and will burn cities, and put people in slave camps.
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:36.864]  I don't care if it's the Aztecs, I don't care if it's the Babylonians, I don't care if it's the ancient Druids, I don't care if it was the Japanese during some periods, or whether it was the North Koreans, or whether it was Africa, it's the same story over and over again.
[01:12:37.604 --> 01:12:44.726]  Rome, and I say this a lot, but I really want to quantify it before I get into all the news.
[01:12:48.717 --> 01:12:50.558]  We are in a progressing tyranny.
[01:12:51.238 --> 01:12:54.420]  It's progressive, like brain cancer, malignant cancer.
[01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:56.661]  It's metastasized.
[01:12:57.481 --> 01:12:58.622]  It's blooming right now.
[01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:10.527]  And unequivocally, I can say the people running things are clearly going to stage massive terror attacks and blame it on domestic groups.
[01:13:11.168 --> 01:13:14.029]  And they are going to try to come arrest a lot of people.
[01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:17.871]  And they really are going to start a civil war.
[01:13:22.765 --> 01:13:28.929]  And anybody that doesn't want to go along with their tyranny, they'll have ISIS, Al Qaeda, blow something up and claim that they did it with you.
[01:13:28.949 --> 01:13:30.270]  And it's real simple.
[01:13:31.071 --> 01:13:38.376]  People either wake up to that, that we've been hijacked, and we are honest about it, or we're going to lose everything.
[01:13:39.557 --> 01:13:44.600]  And I'm 100% sure, that's why every time I end up taking off a week, I realize I should do it more.
[01:13:45.661 --> 01:13:50.164]  Because when I do, it's just so much clearer.
[01:13:52.679 --> 01:14:14.837]  But you don't need a bunch of perception or historical perspectives or super smarts to look at what's going on not just here but all over the world under globalist management and to see that they've created a really deviant, sick system.
[01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:19.656]  And we all study history to a certain extent.
[01:14:19.676 --> 01:14:22.501]  I mean, everybody knows the famous things that have happened in history.
[01:14:23.002 --> 01:14:24.104]  Everybody knows.
[01:14:25.930 --> 01:14:27.471]  That's another cliche, but it really is true.
[01:14:28.392 --> 01:14:46.848]  That elites kill their own family members, marry their horses, dress up like werewolves and tear children's throats out, sacrifice children on fiery altars, bloody altars, have giant wars, make everyone worship them as God, and then become so psychopathic they commit suicide.
[01:14:47.995 --> 01:15:03.524]  I mean, if you study ancient corrupt societies in Rome, you name it though, it would end up basically that if the leader or group of leaders had nuclear weapons, they would detonate them just so they could destroy the Earth.
[01:15:07.586 --> 01:15:15.511]  In the old days, if it was Nero or it was, I forget which, a lot of the Aztec kings and Toltecs and Olmecs, they would commit suicide as well.
[01:15:18.672 --> 01:15:24.194]  That that's what the elites do, is they kill a bunch of people and do weird stuff.
[01:15:24.254 --> 01:15:33.717]  I mean, everybody knows about the elites and their weird sexual proclivities that are bizarre.
[01:15:34.817 --> 01:15:37.978]  And believe me, the general public has no idea what goes on in Hollywood.
[01:15:38.598 --> 01:15:40.199]  No idea what goes on in rock and roll.
[01:15:40.579 --> 01:15:43.440]  I mean, people think they know what the royal family of England's into.
[01:15:45.808 --> 01:15:52.094]  It's so horrible, ladies and gentlemen, that I don't even want to talk about it on air.
[01:15:54.596 --> 01:16:03.364]  And you see the general public, who thinks they know things are corrupt and bad, but really just don't have any idea how deep the waters really are.
[01:16:08.834 --> 01:16:16.260]  You know, I say that it's the best of times, the worst of times, to quote the intro passage from A Tale of Two Cities.
[01:16:19.162 --> 01:16:21.564]  But it is the best of times and the worst of times.
[01:16:23.605 --> 01:16:30.371]  And we're coming to the final leg in a downward spiral cycle
[01:16:32.708 --> 01:16:56.745]  That is going to be the most insane, out-of-control, mass mental illness breakdown the world's ever witnessed, with a bunch of high-tech, GMO, nuclear weapons, melting-down reactors, mass pharmakeia, drugging of the population, cultural breakdown, societal rot,
[01:17:01.167 --> 01:17:07.429]  If we don't turn the corner soon, it's going to be earth-shaking.
[01:17:08.369 --> 01:17:10.269]  It's going to be biblical in nature.
[01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:16.611]  It's going to be a third of the Earth's population dead, conservatively.
[01:17:17.211 --> 01:17:19.872]  And that's what metrics show, not what the Bible says.
[01:17:20.792 --> 01:17:28.794]  The Bible does say that, but... When you come face-to-face with what is now about to unfold, the purposed
[01:17:29.957 --> 01:17:36.382]  Purposeful, provisioned, lovingly prepared collapse of civilization.
[01:17:39.784 --> 01:17:41.485]  Agenda 21 on PCP.
[01:17:44.207 --> 01:17:45.928]  Cloward and Piven squared.
[01:17:50.672 --> 01:17:59.058]  With the globalists who tried to convince us that none of this was being set up, none of this was being prepared, don't pay attention to the man behind the mirror, go to sleep,
[01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:09.826]  And now, at the edge of the precipice, all they can use is the incredible goodwill.
[01:18:11.907 --> 01:18:30.781]  And what was good in Christendom and the Renaissance, those two things mixing together in Western culture, they use the good, better angels of Western civilization to then manipulate the good men and women that could stop this.
[01:18:33.550 --> 01:19:01.089]  into actually aiding it through the new religion of political correctness that is a religion of societal suicide a cultural national abortion of a full-grown civilization a murder and when you look at the truly evil people running things they have a
[01:19:02.379 --> 01:19:05.826]  Real desire to sink the planet.
[01:19:06.327 --> 01:19:08.190]  I mean, look at what globalists do to the third world countries.
[01:19:08.230 --> 01:19:12.238]  They've been keeping them in squalor and keeping them down and dumbing down their culture.
[01:19:13.223 --> 01:19:13.643]  Forever.
[01:19:14.484 --> 01:19:20.469]  And they've been doing it to a certain extent here, but wanted strong imperial command bases to launch their programs.
[01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:40.005]  But the age of man is coming to an end, and so now humanity has to be pulled down into the slums and have their food supply cut off, so they can be socially engineered to accept full cultural control and absorption into the eugenics paradigm.
[01:19:41.144 --> 01:19:50.973]  of forced population reduction on which an HR Geiger-like Hellraiser template will be overlaid.
[01:19:50.993 --> 01:19:55.076]  I mean, they're not going to kill everybody to build something beautiful.
[01:19:55.597 --> 01:19:57.979]  The killing the people is the destination.
[01:19:58.519 --> 01:20:00.381]  The journey is the destination.
[01:20:01.822 --> 01:20:04.585]  The seals of hell, the very gates
[01:20:05.825 --> 01:20:08.049]  Of hell are now being opened.
[01:20:08.089 --> 01:20:08.910]  We'll be right back.

[01:21:14.431 --> 01:21:16.233]  And in a word, the answer is protection.
[01:21:16.593 --> 01:21:25.619]  Protection from water main breaks, E. coli contamination, environmental chemical spills, pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell, and all forms of fluoride.
[01:21:25.899 --> 01:21:31.543]  Plus, Big Berkey water filters are the original gravity water filter system and most trusted on the market for a reason.

[01:21:43.090 --> 01:21:44.530]  That means big savings.

[01:22:07.702 --> 01:22:10.264]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:22:10.525 --> 01:22:15.409]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotsSupply.
[01:22:15.650 --> 01:22:23.537]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:23.777 --> 01:22:28.081]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:22:28.301 --> 01:22:32.105]  MyPatriotsSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:22:32.265 --> 01:22:37.967]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:22:38.207 --> 01:22:40.988]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:22:41.368 --> 01:22:46.590]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[01:23:36.758 --> 01:23:41.261]  There's one major factor affecting the health of millions, and most people are completely unaware.
[01:23:41.501 --> 01:23:47.064]  Acid levels, soda, meat, dairy, caffeine, and sugar can all lead to elevated acid levels in the body.
[01:23:47.204 --> 01:23:51.667]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops get the body's pH levels back in perfect balance.

[01:24:38.527 --> 01:24:39.047]  Welcome back.
[01:24:39.407 --> 01:24:44.369]  That was kind of a meandering last segment.
[01:24:44.389 --> 01:24:51.691]  Let me try to hone it in here and play a clip of Nancy Pelosi dovetailed with General Petraeus in a moment.
[01:24:54.691 --> 01:25:01.733]  But when you study criminology, when you study psychology, when you study anthropology, it's all really the same.
[01:25:02.293 --> 01:25:03.474]  The patterns are repeated.
[01:25:05.394 --> 01:25:07.415]  And whether you believe in a physical devil or not,
[01:25:08.371 --> 01:25:18.016]  When we let an authoritarian system come into place, the very worst in the culture will end up migrating into positions of power.
[01:25:19.437 --> 01:25:33.304]  And you'll have people low-level, even in a corrupt system, that will mitigate some of that, because they have humanity, and they will basically sidestep the fraud.
[01:25:33.944 --> 01:25:35.565]  They will sidestep the oppression.
[01:25:37.153 --> 01:25:40.935]  They will let you get out of the net.
[01:25:44.518 --> 01:26:02.989]  But once the computerized system goes into place, and you have zero ability to make your own decisions in corporate life, religious life, private life, governmental systems, regulatory systems, you are now simply a biological android.
[01:26:04.170 --> 01:26:04.630]  A robot.
[01:26:06.055 --> 01:26:08.637]  That is carrying out the orders it's given.
[01:26:11.959 --> 01:26:31.574]  And then you're allowed a little tribal stimulation and some soccer games or football and you're allowed to have some sex and you're allowed to... While the noose is being tightened on the species itself and you're being given binary weapons, binary poisons into your body,
[01:26:34.158 --> 01:26:43.866]  To kill you down the road and they'll even make money out of treating the artificial illness that you were given.
[01:26:46.068 --> 01:26:57.297]  And I think that's really what it all comes down to is 100% there is an artificial global scientific dictatorship forming that wants full control and is getting close.
[01:27:00.237 --> 01:27:05.081]  And the only way to beat it is to fully admit how real it is.
[01:27:07.643 --> 01:27:16.009]  Because again, the general public are still good people on average, but are just so ignorant because they're being faced with something so encompassing.
[01:27:17.811 --> 01:27:20.713]  And I'm like a monkey in a cage that sees the bars.
[01:27:21.634 --> 01:27:28.079]  And I'm simply trying to get the other creatures around me to realize that we're in an artificial system.
[01:27:30.438 --> 01:27:41.146]  That's becoming more and more artificial all the time, whose aim is our domination and then our slow bleeding out and destruction.
[01:27:43.508 --> 01:27:45.409]  The goal is to imprison us.
[01:27:45.890 --> 01:27:47.491]  The goal is to torture us.
[01:27:48.071 --> 01:27:52.735]  The goal is to destroy our families, destroy our culture, and to render us down.
[01:27:54.721 --> 01:28:15.797]  That's why good people tend to lose in the first three quarters of historical fights against evil, because good just can't believe it's happening, because it doesn't make sense from a perspective of someone that has empathy, and that has honor, and that wants to be loving, and that wants to be good, to have pure darkness coming against you.
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:20.801]  You just can't believe your lying eyes.
[01:28:25.882 --> 01:28:34.926]  But the good news is, every metric shows that government and the corporate systems that control it are in deep trouble.
[01:28:34.946 --> 01:28:39.288]  7% approval rating gallop for Congress.
[01:28:39.729 --> 01:28:43.390]  14% approval rating down from 17 just a few months ago for the mainstream media.
[01:28:44.531 --> 01:28:48.173]  Alternative media, highest approval ratings ever.
[01:28:49.013 --> 01:28:50.454]  Meteoric metric rise.
[01:28:56.246 --> 01:29:02.647]  But then you have to go to the next level and realize the system knows that and it knew that all along and it knew this would be unpopular.
[01:29:02.988 --> 01:29:07.488]  That's why the armored vehicles, the tanks, the helicopters, the checkpoints are coming out of the box.
[01:29:09.449 --> 01:29:18.611]  And coming out of the subterranean garages is because they're taking the gloves off.
[01:29:20.509 --> 01:29:29.231]  But the average person even that's going to enforce all this is being decompartmentalized as the gloves come off.
[01:29:29.251 --> 01:29:37.994]  They're going, wait a minute, because the Liberty Movement, before we got to this point, warned everyone and was demonized and attacked.
[01:29:38.734 --> 01:29:41.655]  And the enemy's demonization and hatred and attack of us
[01:29:42.834 --> 01:29:47.717]  Actually drew attention to us and is now boomeranging back on them.
[01:29:47.777 --> 01:29:52.921]  So we're at this key flux point right now where this could be turned around.
[01:29:53.721 --> 01:29:56.763]  I want to talk about that when we come back, but we can stop this.
[01:29:58.084 --> 01:29:58.985]  We're on the march.
[01:29:59.485 --> 01:30:01.086]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.007 --> 01:30:04.689]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:08.985 --> 01:30:12.987]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:30:13.007 --> 01:30:17.128]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:30:17.388 --> 01:30:20.789]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:30:21.050 --> 01:30:23.931]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:30:24.091 --> 01:30:31.454]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:30:31.654 --> 01:30:35.295]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:30:35.555 --> 01:30:39.816]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:30:39.976 --> 01:30:45.918]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:30:45.978 --> 01:30:49.718]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:30:49.878 --> 01:30:52.439]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:30:52.619 --> 01:30:53.979]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:30:54.139 --> 01:30:55.360]  It's time to take action.
[01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:57.200]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:31:09.301 --> 01:31:14.043]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[01:31:14.263 --> 01:31:17.364]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[01:31:17.624 --> 01:31:19.445]  She's just not the woman I married.
[01:31:19.725 --> 01:31:21.645]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[01:31:21.885 --> 01:31:23.346]  Does this seem familiar?
[01:31:23.526 --> 01:31:26.567]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[01:31:26.847 --> 01:31:28.168]  If so, consider this.
[01:31:28.428 --> 01:31:37.371]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[01:31:37.731 --> 01:31:43.735]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.
[01:31:44.115 --> 01:31:45.736]  Forget synthetic chemicals.
[01:31:46.136 --> 01:31:53.821]  Super Female Vitality brings forward key herbs specifically chosen for women's biology without the use of phony additives.

[01:32:02.025 --> 01:32:03.025]  Live Life Healthy!
[01:32:09.361 --> 01:32:15.310]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:19.716]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:32:20.077 --> 01:32:24.644]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:32:25.044 --> 01:32:27.666]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:32:27.966 --> 01:32:33.169]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:32:33.410 --> 01:32:40.314]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:32:40.814 --> 01:32:44.577]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:32:44.937 --> 01:32:49.720]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:50.901]  This is innovating.
[01:32:51.181 --> 01:32:58.485]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:32:58.645 --> 01:33:02.728]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[01:33:16.443 --> 01:33:27.330]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[01:33:31.553 --> 01:33:34.315]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:38.258 --> 01:33:41.500]  Just as sure as the sun came up this morning, it's going to set in the evening.
[01:33:45.017 --> 01:33:53.703]  The globalists do plan an authoritarian hardcore takeover in this country.
[01:33:55.365 --> 01:34:10.936]  And it's a marvel of the enemy PSYOP that we can be in the middle of a global financial sustained meltdown and have the establishment since 2008
[01:34:14.665 --> 01:34:40.014]  Globally turning the economy off on purpose, only giving themselves the literally hundreds of trillions in dollars and euros and other currencies, and then passing the debt on to us, while creating giant welfare classes whose daily government prayers are answered with more welfare and more largesse.
[01:34:41.056 --> 01:34:44.859]  Ready to do politically whatever they're told for their handouts.
[01:34:51.005 --> 01:35:00.713]  Now, now continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, I've got so many hundreds of points I want to make.
[01:35:05.517 --> 01:35:07.259]  But we are in the midst
[01:35:09.159 --> 01:35:13.420]  Of the continued economic conquest of the planet by the globalists.
[01:35:15.841 --> 01:35:24.503]  And again, they want to economically have conquest and control, so that they can then run our lives, because that's what they desire to do.
[01:35:25.924 --> 01:35:28.744]  And they want to run our lives in a very bad direction.
[01:35:30.485 --> 01:35:33.786]  And as their plan comes into crisp focus,
[01:35:35.290 --> 01:35:41.992]  And everyone sees the hypocrisy, everyone sees the fraud, everyone sees the security theater for what it is, a power grab.
[01:35:44.713 --> 01:35:48.474]  All of us will have a decision to make as it becomes more and more apparent.
[01:35:49.675 --> 01:35:52.796]  Are you going to speak out against this when we have a chance to turn it around?
[01:35:56.377 --> 01:36:00.378]  Or are you going to be forced to stand up against it when there's not much hope?
[01:36:03.263 --> 01:36:08.607]  But, now you realize how evil it is, and just your fight or flight kicks in, there's nowhere to run.
[01:36:08.647 --> 01:36:09.027]  You fight.
[01:36:11.108 --> 01:36:12.369]  I just got chills when I said that.
[01:36:13.870 --> 01:36:15.151]  And then of course there's a worse time.
[01:36:15.571 --> 01:36:17.252]  And I'm paraphrasing Winston Churchill right now.
[01:36:18.253 --> 01:36:19.534]  There's a time when you don't have any hope.
[01:36:21.175 --> 01:36:26.238]  But you're still gonna fight, because it's better than being on your knees, having these wolves pull your guts out your rear end.
[01:36:27.439 --> 01:36:28.399]  That's what wolves do, folks.
[01:36:28.439 --> 01:36:29.780]  They eat you from the hind end up.
[01:36:30.741 --> 01:36:31.801]  Because they like to watch you.
[01:36:32.739 --> 01:36:33.559]  They like to hurt you.
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:35.701]  They like to hear you cry and beg.
[01:36:36.041 --> 01:36:38.562]  They enjoy their red meat with screams.
[01:36:40.824 --> 01:36:43.485]  The New World Order has already killed most of us.
[01:36:44.506 --> 01:36:48.008]  They've already taken 10, 20, 30 years off our lifespans.
[01:36:49.368 --> 01:36:51.289]  They've already fed us GMO poison.
[01:36:51.329 --> 01:36:52.970]  They've already filled our water with poison.
[01:36:54.271 --> 01:36:59.194]  And they sell us expensive treatments for what they've helped engineer.
[01:37:00.518 --> 01:37:18.649]  A lot of it's human stupidity and human corruption, but guiding it and riding this beast of corruption, directing it like a grand conductor, is the archetype of Mephistopheles.
[01:37:23.171 --> 01:37:24.312]  And people ask, why?
[01:37:25.132 --> 01:37:27.774]  Because, to them,
[01:37:29.582 --> 01:37:35.025]  Great evil and great suffering of the innocent is a beautiful thing.
[01:37:36.546 --> 01:37:44.071]  And we are a nation that rationalized and made up the legal arguments that on many levels can make sense to you.
[01:37:45.131 --> 01:37:51.715]  That 53 million babies since 1973 were not humans.
[01:37:55.637 --> 01:37:58.159]  And black people weren't humans, so go ahead and inject them with syphilis.
[01:38:01.004 --> 01:38:05.627]  And Appalachian poor white people weren't humans, so go ahead and sterilize them, inject them with syphilis.
[01:38:05.667 --> 01:38:06.627]  Oh yeah, that's coming out too.
[01:38:06.647 --> 01:38:13.551]  It's just, you know, anybody they can get their hands on who nobody will believe, they're going to do this to them.
[01:38:14.772 --> 01:38:21.756]  What do you think they're doing now when I could sit here for 10 hours and just read declassified public tests?
[01:38:23.163 --> 01:38:29.389]  of lethal and close to lethal agents on innocent populations by the people running this government.
[01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:35.755]  Of course they took blood for 42 years worldwide at birth from everyone under globalist control.
[01:38:35.775 --> 01:38:40.180]  That's the British Empire, Europe and the United States.
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:41.321]  That's the global empire right now.
[01:38:43.325 --> 01:38:50.289]  I mean, my gosh, the Arabs are corrupt and out of control, the Russians have got their own corruption, but they're not putting cancer viruses in their vaccines.
[01:38:50.570 --> 01:38:52.111]  Oh, they were back in the Soviet Union.
[01:38:52.691 --> 01:38:55.713]  That's why they've rejected everything they were, at least on the surface.
[01:38:56.173 --> 01:38:57.414]  Old habits die hard.
[01:39:01.617 --> 01:39:03.958]  But it's all real.
[01:39:04.799 --> 01:39:05.979]  The New World Order is real.
[01:39:06.319 --> 01:39:07.941]  All the things they're doing to us are real.
[01:39:09.882 --> 01:39:11.523]  Look at the lawlessness
[01:39:14.685 --> 01:39:27.308]  of military bases all over the United States as staging grounds for the welfare queens of Latin America and the rest of the world now is coming.
[01:39:28.608 --> 01:39:43.991]  These aren't the quote hard-working immigrants that would come here in the past who then second-generation will become welfare queens like other Americans but still vote for the Democratic Party and gun control and socialism because that was the group that was their friend.
[01:39:45.109 --> 01:39:47.250]  Even as they push Gardasil shots on their daughters.
[01:39:49.991 --> 01:39:51.092]  Sterilization shots.
[01:39:53.533 --> 01:40:08.619]  Now it's literally the criminal dregs, the mules, the gang members, the mentally disturbed, the prisoners, and, you know, 500-pound women with six kids.
[01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:11.060]  And six-sex underwear.
[01:40:13.829 --> 01:40:32.757]  Dumping them here and then having the gall with Nancy Pelosi Last weekend Coming out and saying we're all Citizens of North America this hemisphere.
[01:40:32.997 --> 01:40:34.158]  We're all Americans.
[01:40:34.638 --> 01:40:39.120]  That's that's the new talking point That's Petraeus saying what's next North America?
[01:40:40.201 --> 01:40:42.842]  But it's not some North America where you mix
[01:40:44.122 --> 01:40:49.486]  Switzerland and the United States better attributes with the better attributes of Latin America.
[01:40:49.506 --> 01:40:51.107]  And there's some good things about Latin America.
[01:40:51.587 --> 01:40:52.167]  No, no, no.
[01:40:52.488 --> 01:40:58.351]  You take the worst things and you put them on a pedestal.
[01:41:00.153 --> 01:41:05.096]  And why did the CIA declassify last year that they would promote sick and deviant art?
[01:41:07.984 --> 01:41:09.906]  And that they would push that on the American audience?
[01:41:10.386 --> 01:41:15.230]  Because they had to get you, in their own words, used to accepting anything.
[01:41:16.531 --> 01:41:18.773]  And it's not that I can't handle sick or deviant art.
[01:41:19.834 --> 01:41:24.939]  It's not that there isn't even something sometimes too sick or deviant art to illustrate something political.
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:30.624]  It's that they pushed it to sabotage
[01:41:33.570 --> 01:41:56.544]  The elective process that a normal brain would develop over life to push people into degeneracy so that you would be weak and could be destroyed.
[01:41:59.324 --> 01:42:01.786]  And I've told people that for years, and now it's declassified.
[01:42:01.826 --> 01:42:07.129]  I mean, it's not... I don't need to read classified documents to look at an operation.
[01:42:12.872 --> 01:42:21.217]  And, again, it is as if Satan himself ran our government.
[01:42:24.299 --> 01:42:25.440]  Whether you believe in the devil or not.
[01:42:31.482 --> 01:42:46.325]  Because the way they get good people to go along with this, and to work for it, and to be part of it, and how deceived they are, and how invested in the lie they are, destroying their own future.
[01:42:51.786 --> 01:42:55.687]  Imagine the fact that we broke, three weeks ago,
[01:42:58.697 --> 01:43:08.921]  With emergency managers, ICE agents, video of it, whistleblowers, on camera, off camera, by every journalistic standard.
[01:43:09.681 --> 01:43:16.964]  Wasn't the radio host Alex Jones, the mad prophet of the airwaves as they call me, you know, at the Southern Poverty Law Center or Time Magazine, up there ranting about it.
[01:43:16.984 --> 01:43:20.425]  It was just reporters being serious, going down doing interviews.
[01:43:22.807 --> 01:43:35.296]  Then a week after we broke it, and Drudge Report carried it, DrudgeReport.com carried the Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com articles, AP came out and said, yeah, the illegals are being bused deeper into the United States by the government.
[01:43:35.856 --> 01:43:41.340]  They didn't go on to say, by the way, the government pays for it and advertises for them to come up here, but they told most of the story.
[01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:44.162]  And then guess who came out as soon as that got traction?
[01:43:45.603 --> 01:43:51.227]  The White House came out, through Media Matters, but the White House came out as well, and said,
[01:43:52.964 --> 01:43:55.566]  I mean, this is the anatomy, the tissue of a total fraud.
[01:43:56.946 --> 01:43:57.807]  The structure of it.
[01:43:59.068 --> 01:44:05.491]  You can study just this one lie with a master's degree, because once you understand this lie, you understand how all the other lies work.
[01:44:07.292 --> 01:44:20.120]  And how the lie just sits there as a fraud, and then it's just an excuse for us to do nothing, Congress to do nothing, the states to do nothing, while our entire futures are being burned down now.
[01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:22.301]  This is only the beginning.
[01:44:29.451 --> 01:44:32.813]  You have small towns collapsing all along the 2,000 mile border.
[01:44:32.893 --> 01:44:34.294]  You have crime exploding.
[01:44:39.017 --> 01:44:45.242]  And you have the federal government pulling in with buses from Mexico.
[01:44:46.262 --> 01:44:49.805]  And no Border Patrol trucks at a stand down, and not just us saying it,
[01:44:50.796 --> 01:45:05.332]  The Border Patrol Union President and Vice President are on Infowars.com, Breitbart, on record saying, yes, we've been ordered three months ago to stand down from Southern California.
[01:45:10.046 --> 01:45:11.007]  To Southern Texas.
[01:45:11.547 --> 01:45:13.488]  From San Diego to Brownsville is the quote.
[01:45:14.389 --> 01:45:16.391]  There is no border enforcement going on.
[01:45:16.771 --> 01:45:20.293]  I was down in Big Bend three months ago and told you, I used to see Border Patrol everywhere.
[01:45:20.333 --> 01:45:20.994]  They were nowhere.
[01:45:25.737 --> 01:45:30.901]  I used to pull into the checkpoint in Alpine, 70 miles in, where they would let illegals through, but be told to go after citizens.
[01:45:31.281 --> 01:45:32.082]  There was no one there.
[01:45:32.962 --> 01:45:35.104]  One guy, and they just were waving everybody through.
[01:45:35.664 --> 01:45:37.486]  Wide open.
[01:45:38.519 --> 01:45:41.660]  And Mexico opened its southern border on record.
[01:45:45.401 --> 01:45:56.324]  I mean, this is the false flag, and the public is so in the dark that even when AP comes out and admits it, no one has an instinct to get freaked out about it.
[01:46:01.345 --> 01:46:05.406]  And so really, I'm just marveling, taking off six days, spending time with family.
[01:46:10.467 --> 01:46:17.048]  I just, just in retrospective, it was just, it just hit me.
[01:46:17.129 --> 01:46:18.089]  It's all real.
[01:46:18.169 --> 01:46:20.849]  It's really, it's all beyond what I thought.
[01:46:20.889 --> 01:46:21.890]  It's so evil.
[01:46:22.290 --> 01:46:23.690]  And it's all just about to start.
[01:46:24.130 --> 01:46:26.210]  You've seen nothing, nothing yet.
[01:46:27.231 --> 01:46:30.411]  They really want to put 50 million of us in camps just in the U.S.
[01:46:30.451 --> 01:46:32.772]  alone and pull our teeth out with pliers, folks.
[01:46:34.292 --> 01:46:35.012]  And they will do it.
[01:46:36.733 --> 01:46:37.453]  Because they want to.
[01:46:38.732 --> 01:46:41.234]  They really are going to blow up federal buildings and blame it on us.
[01:46:43.015 --> 01:46:50.760]  They really are going to bring in a total world government and release bioweapons in the next phase after that and just start calling people en masse.
[01:46:53.422 --> 01:47:01.967]  They really are wrecking everything on purpose and again, you go to the TSA
[01:47:05.441 --> 01:47:12.024]  And you say you want to opt out, and the public's been bucking them so much they've made them behave and gotten rid of the more imperious people.
[01:47:14.005 --> 01:47:18.407]  But I had this one guy literally bug his eyes out and go, so you want to opt out?
[01:47:18.427 --> 01:47:19.208]  Like he was scaring me.
[01:47:20.708 --> 01:47:24.530]  This is in Houston last night, coming back through at the end of, quote, customs.
[01:47:26.171 --> 01:47:30.653]  And I started just preaching at them, not in a loud voice, and they were freaking out.
[01:47:30.673 --> 01:47:31.814]  They had like six of them around me.
[01:47:32.454 --> 01:47:34.295]  And all I was doing was calmly.
[01:47:35.222 --> 01:47:38.224]  Saying, listen, this is all basically unlawful.
[01:47:42.007 --> 01:47:46.771]  But I said, you know, the southern border is wide open.
[01:47:47.832 --> 01:47:50.994]  And I said, you're supposed to let me through and just do your quote pat down.
[01:47:53.096 --> 01:47:54.377]  You know, I've done nothing to you.
[01:47:54.797 --> 01:47:59.041]  And I'm sad that you're such an unhappy person that you were bugging your eyes out of me and getting mad at me.
[01:48:00.503 --> 01:48:03.525]  And this went on for about two minutes and they all just collapsed.
[01:48:03.805 --> 01:48:06.786]  And then the head guy came over and apologized and took me through.
[01:48:08.127 --> 01:48:10.828]  And I realized the fact that I didn't even get angry at him.
[01:48:11.409 --> 01:48:14.190]  I literally said, you are a poor slave and I love you.
[01:48:15.190 --> 01:48:21.494]  And I'm sorry that you've had such an empty life, that this is the only job you've got and you're on this petty power trip.
[01:48:22.234 --> 01:48:23.955]  And that you know this is a fraud and a lie.
[01:48:24.966 --> 01:48:26.566]  And you know you're jumping all over me.
[01:48:26.606 --> 01:48:31.268]  This old lady, it was like six of them, in my face, and you're acting like you'd like to hurt me.
[01:48:34.669 --> 01:48:37.990]  Look at your fellow citizens with their shoes off to be humiliated.
[01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:45.372]  Like they're going into a, you know, a delousing Nazi facility with their clothes stripped off.
[01:48:47.492 --> 01:48:50.353]  And just look at how this is a total preparation for takeover.
[01:48:51.613 --> 01:48:54.174]  And how they lie to you about the cancer risk of these machines.
[01:48:59.164 --> 01:49:00.604]  And see, it wasn't fun anymore.
[01:49:00.624 --> 01:49:02.725]  Because I wasn't even angry at him.
[01:49:05.825 --> 01:49:07.666]  But our borders are wide open.
[01:49:10.606 --> 01:49:13.247]  And they now have internal highway checkpoints.
[01:49:14.627 --> 01:49:16.608]  They now have snitch systems.
[01:49:16.648 --> 01:49:25.189]  They now, in the news, oh yes, nationwide we're putting up microphones and systems that grab all your data without warrants and track everything you do in real time to keep you safe.
[01:49:25.549 --> 01:49:27.070]  It's all completely illegal, but we're doing it.
[01:49:27.450 --> 01:49:28.270]  But the border's wide open.
[01:49:29.761 --> 01:49:38.949]  Oh, and by the way, the Tea Party are terrorists, and the Pentagon's trading that they're going to start a civil war and start bombing police stations everywhere, with no proof, no evidence, no background, no history.
[01:49:39.729 --> 01:49:46.615]  Again, with all the sitcoms and dramas showing the Patriots blowing everything up in almost every TV show out there.
[01:49:47.896 --> 01:49:52.600]  Every cop show, every drama, every FBI show, every, you know, 24-type show.
[01:49:53.761 --> 01:49:55.642]  Because they're preparing that.
[01:49:56.583 --> 01:49:57.584]  And they don't care
[01:49:59.793 --> 01:50:06.658]  How many people die because they're sitting offshore, they're going to watch the whole thing and fiddle while America burns?
[01:50:10.821 --> 01:50:13.563]  And so really it comes down to this point for the American people.
[01:50:13.843 --> 01:50:14.884]  The people of the world as well.
[01:50:14.904 --> 01:50:15.524]  This is global.
[01:50:17.586 --> 01:50:19.447]  You may think you're in Switzerland, you're going to be okay.
[01:50:19.467 --> 01:50:22.169]  You may think you're off in some Caribbean island, you're going to be okay.
[01:50:22.209 --> 01:50:22.610]  No, you're not.
[01:50:25.932 --> 01:50:26.773]  This collapse
[01:50:28.849 --> 01:50:30.349]  Is a spiritual collapse.
[01:50:31.070 --> 01:50:33.230]  A cultural collapse of morals.
[01:50:37.032 --> 01:50:38.932]  And all of it is so expertly done.
[01:50:38.952 --> 01:50:45.094]  Where they only gave the TV licenses to the most horrible, fake, con artist preachers.
[01:50:46.855 --> 01:50:48.135]  To destroy Christianity.
[01:50:48.175 --> 01:50:49.775]  I mean, it's genius!
[01:50:51.376 --> 01:50:52.576]  I mean, I marvel at it.
[01:50:53.197 --> 01:50:53.817]  Quite frankly.
[01:50:53.837 --> 01:50:57.698]  Because I see the whole design.
[01:50:59.821 --> 01:51:02.107]  And then I see the public walking into the meat grinder.
[01:51:02.127 --> 01:51:05.515]  And I don't even know what to say.
[01:51:05.535 --> 01:51:07.379]  I'm going to play the Pelosi Club when we come back.
[01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:08.021]  Stay with us.

[01:51:38.885 --> 01:51:39.665]  This is Dan Pilla.
[01:51:39.685 --> 01:51:41.186]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:51:41.506 --> 01:51:42.787]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:51:43.147 --> 01:51:45.488]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:51:45.968 --> 01:51:47.829]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:51:48.269 --> 01:51:52.311]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[01:52:00.915 --> 01:52:02.236]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[01:52:08.303 --> 01:52:14.245]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:52:14.465 --> 01:52:18.667]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:52:19.027 --> 01:52:23.549]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:52:23.969 --> 01:52:26.590]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:52:26.890 --> 01:52:32.091]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:52:32.351 --> 01:52:39.192]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:52:39.712 --> 01:52:43.473]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:52:43.833 --> 01:52:48.614]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:52:48.934 --> 01:52:49.794]  This is innovating.
[01:52:50.074 --> 01:52:57.340]  And the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:52:57.540 --> 01:53:01.584]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[01:53:07.649 --> 01:53:09.070]  A sudden change in the wind.
[01:53:09.530 --> 01:53:15.532]  The day grows dark as ominous clouds move in and lightning begins to carve arcs in the sky.
[01:53:15.552 --> 01:53:18.733]  And you realize you are not prepared.
[01:53:20.433 --> 01:53:24.174]  The number of intense storms is increasing exponentially in the U.S.
[01:53:24.474 --> 01:53:30.316]  Tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding, and droughts are happening with greater magnitude and frequency.
[01:53:30.556 --> 01:53:33.217]  If you are choosing to rely on the government to save your
[01:53:33.297 --> 01:53:34.717]  And no one's coming to help them.
[01:53:34.898 --> 01:53:36.218]  You could be dead wrong.
[01:53:36.478 --> 01:53:41.580]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster is a visit to mypatriotsupply.com.

[01:53:57.826 --> 01:54:01.247]  And speak to one of our preparedness advisors today.
[01:54:01.447 --> 01:54:04.689]  Remember, before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.
[01:54:05.069 --> 01:54:06.770]  MyPatriotsSupply.com
[01:54:19.716 --> 01:54:30.983]  I want to thank the Creator for the gift of consciousness and for the fact that despite all of my foibles and warts, I do want justice.
[01:54:32.804 --> 01:54:33.725]  And I'm not a coward.
[01:54:35.786 --> 01:54:37.747]  And I'm going to go to the end against these people.
[01:54:38.808 --> 01:54:42.090]  Because there's no hope in giving in to them.
[01:54:43.331 --> 01:54:46.313]  And I think once we can create a spark
[01:54:48.689 --> 01:54:54.610]  In the mind out there, in fact I know this, it's infectious, especially in a time of great evil.
[01:54:58.451 --> 01:55:07.573]  We need to reach out to people and let them know the full story, why things are bad, why things don't seem right, why things are so twisted.
[01:55:09.394 --> 01:55:14.155]  Think of the arrogance of the elite to open the Mexican border to Guatemala
[01:55:15.051 --> 01:55:31.074]  And to open the Texas and California and Arizona and other borders on the south of the United States to flood the country and have Nancy Pelosi say, oh, I love the Hispanic children.
[01:55:31.514 --> 01:55:33.614]  I want to take some home with me if I could.
[01:55:34.054 --> 01:55:40.435]  As if that multi-hundred millionaire swindling criminal mafia literal witch.
[01:55:41.196 --> 01:55:43.776]  I mean, these are gangsters, folks, by every metric.
[01:55:45.333 --> 01:55:46.394]  Feinstein, all of them.
[01:55:46.414 --> 01:55:48.657]  I mean, these are criminal masterminds.
[01:55:55.507 --> 01:56:01.455]  And they can open the borders up and say, don't be racist, take home some Hispanic children.
[01:56:02.636 --> 01:56:02.837]  What?
[01:56:04.776 --> 01:56:07.399]  And this is our family.
[01:56:07.439 --> 01:56:08.560]  This is North America.
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:10.322]  This is our region.
[01:56:10.382 --> 01:56:11.563]  This is our hemisphere.
[01:56:12.684 --> 01:56:21.312]  Because we're in the North American Union, and what conservatives have to realize is George W. Bush signed that in a secret agreement with Vicente Fox, declassified 2007.
[01:56:21.352 --> 01:56:21.692]  He signed it in 2005.
[01:56:21.733 --> 01:56:22.874]  The full agreement remains classified.
[01:56:29.209 --> 01:56:30.610]  That's why I've been freaking out, folks.
[01:56:30.630 --> 01:56:38.733]  They have classified North American Union agreements, and then Bush comes out in 2007 and gives a Rose Garden speech with Merkel.
[01:56:40.213 --> 01:56:41.073]  This is an endgame.
[01:56:41.414 --> 01:56:44.235]  And Barroso, the head of the union at the time, admitting it all!
[01:56:45.615 --> 01:56:53.178]  I mean, it's like the Southern Poverty Law Center and the White House mouthpiece, the mouth of Soran, Media Matters.
[01:56:54.827 --> 01:57:02.393]  Came out last week and said, you know, Fox News, CNN, picking up Alex Jones' conspiracy theory that they're letting illegals in.
[01:57:02.673 --> 01:57:03.534]  Letting them in?
[01:57:03.974 --> 01:57:06.276]  Hell, they're paying to ship them wherever they want to go!
[01:57:06.296 --> 01:57:08.117]  I mean, I have it in triplicate!
[01:57:09.298 --> 01:57:13.321]  Ice whistleblowers, emergency managers of major cities, video of it!
[01:57:17.363 --> 01:57:23.667]  I mean, you think I just get up here and say hydrofluorosilicic acid will reduce your child's IQ by at least 10 points, Harvard study?
[01:57:23.987 --> 01:57:25.168]  You think I just made that up?
[01:57:26.428 --> 01:57:28.009]  Seven-fold increase in bone cancer?
[01:57:28.149 --> 01:57:31.512]  You think I just... I'm not making jack crap up, okay?
[01:57:31.672 --> 01:57:33.173]  I'm not making nothing up!
[01:57:33.193 --> 01:57:36.715]  And I'm sick of people out there in denial.
[01:57:36.875 --> 01:57:38.516]  You're gonna lose everything, people!
[01:57:40.077 --> 01:57:42.218]  We're in grave danger.
[01:57:42.958 --> 01:57:46.921]  We're already in deep you-know-what, but it's getting deeper fast.
[01:57:49.113 --> 01:57:56.659]  And as a man, as a parent, I mean, my spider sense is just off the charts.
[01:57:56.799 --> 01:58:06.047]  And I told you months ago, get ready, they've got full-scale war in Ukraine, full-scale war in the Middle East and in Africa with Al Qaeda taking over everywhere.
[01:58:07.448 --> 01:58:09.470]  Missiles have been given to them by our evil government.
[01:58:09.670 --> 01:58:10.811]  The border's wide open.
[01:58:11.271 --> 01:58:13.873]  It's like a bad James Bond villain runs America.
[01:58:14.734 --> 01:58:15.875]  And it's beyond Obama.
[01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:20.061]  I never got to the Pelosi clip.
[01:58:20.081 --> 01:58:24.144]  We'll get to it with... Let's... There he did.
[01:58:24.164 --> 01:58:25.305]  Let's go out to break with her.
[01:58:25.525 --> 01:58:26.125]  I said I'd do it.
[01:58:26.406 --> 01:58:27.206]  Go out to break with her.
[01:58:27.226 --> 01:58:27.546]  Here she is.
[01:58:27.887 --> 01:58:33.631]  Anyone who comes here sees that this is a community with a border going through it.
[01:58:34.091 --> 01:58:38.495]  Boldly proclaimed the coming North American decades as the title now.
[01:58:39.315 --> 01:58:47.904]  It's founded on recognition that if you put these three economies together, as has been the case 20 years ago... We'll be back, we'll be back.
[01:58:48.204 --> 01:58:50.106]  And again, he goes on to say, what's next, America?
[01:58:50.126 --> 01:58:50.667]  That's Petraeus.
[01:58:50.947 --> 01:58:55.192]  And again, they told you they weren't doing it while they do it!
[01:58:55.372 --> 01:58:56.273]  And it isn't good!
[01:58:56.293 --> 01:58:57.214]  That's another thing!
[01:58:59.417 --> 01:59:01.178]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grew.
[01:59:01.699 --> 01:59:08.663]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[01:59:09.123 --> 01:59:19.550]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[01:59:19.971 --> 01:59:29.197]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[01:59:29.917 --> 01:59:33.338]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[01:59:33.978 --> 01:59:37.399]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[01:59:37.739 --> 01:59:39.300]  Experience the new formula.
[01:59:39.800 --> 01:59:41.761]  Experience the ancient purity.
[01:59:42.361 --> 01:59:43.661]  Shield your family.
[01:59:43.701 --> 01:59:45.082]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:59:45.522 --> 01:59:48.123]  Available now at Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:48.683 --> 01:59:52.664]  X2 from Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:00:01.624 --> 02:00:03.529]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:04.010 --> 02:00:06.797]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:14.724 --> 02:00:15.344]  Big Brother.
[02:00:16.024 --> 02:00:17.045]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:17.785 --> 02:00:18.885]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:19.545 --> 02:00:20.345]  You want answers?
[02:00:21.126 --> 02:00:22.026]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:22.666 --> 02:00:26.267]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:26.867 --> 02:00:30.968]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:37.570 --> 02:00:40.911]  Born out of chaos is the globalist's credo.
[02:00:41.871 --> 02:00:42.331]  Maximum.
[02:00:44.738 --> 02:00:45.058]  Signet.
[02:00:48.722 --> 02:00:51.685]  And until they're punished for their crimes, we have no future.
[02:00:52.225 --> 02:00:54.848]  Billionaire tells Americans prepare for financial ruin.
[02:00:56.529 --> 02:00:58.111]  Trump points out downgrade of U.S.
[02:00:58.151 --> 02:00:59.032]  debt is inevitable.
[02:01:00.373 --> 02:01:01.714]  Yeah, we were maneuvered to this point.
[02:01:02.655 --> 02:01:07.240]  And those of us that said don't do it, you're a conspiracy theorist because you have top economists on.
[02:01:09.718 --> 02:01:35.648]  You know, and I was so thankful three weeks ago when Drudge linked to a lot of Infowars.com stories, not because it sent traffic to my website, and that's part of it, but because the story then broke and it forced the national debate to begin, which the White House came out and said, this is not happening.
[02:01:37.028 --> 02:01:38.429]  We're not letting illegals in.
[02:01:39.935 --> 02:01:46.338]  And because you didn't have amnesty, this has now happened, the answer is legalize everybody and that'll make everybody stop coming.
[02:01:46.578 --> 02:01:46.758]  What?
[02:01:47.739 --> 02:01:47.979]  Yeah.
[02:01:48.879 --> 02:01:50.420]  We're gonna legalize bank robbing.
[02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:51.941]  That'll make bank robbery stop.
[02:01:52.021 --> 02:01:54.582]  I mean, it's just, it's insane.
[02:01:55.703 --> 02:01:57.704]  It would increase bank robbery, just so you know.
[02:02:00.256 --> 02:02:02.357]  And it's a system run by criminals for criminals.
[02:02:02.417 --> 02:02:09.379]  It's like where they say, you can't have a gun to defend yourself at your bank or your business, but the police aren't going to respond when you get robbed.
[02:02:09.839 --> 02:02:10.819]  I mean, that's what this is.
[02:02:11.099 --> 02:02:19.962]  Give us your guns, America, and we're going to let the dregs of the world come here and just walk across the border and we'll put them on a bus and bus them right into the middle of the country.
[02:02:21.982 --> 02:02:22.902]  National suicide.
[02:02:22.922 --> 02:02:28.244]  And I know I keep going back to that over and over again, but I was complaining.
[02:02:32.037 --> 02:02:42.519]  Earlier, last week, that, you know, the national media was spinning and lying with our story about the border being wide open.
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:44.360]  But why was I complaining?
[02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:53.462]  They ignored the Border Patrol President, and they ignored the Vice President, saying there's an open stand down.
[02:02:54.302 --> 02:02:54.842]  That's the quote.
[02:02:54.902 --> 02:02:55.863]  There is a stand down.
[02:02:56.143 --> 02:02:57.103]  There is no border.
[02:03:00.336 --> 02:03:04.237]  They're told, citizens that come back through, look and see if they've got Rohibbonol in the car.
[02:03:04.517 --> 02:03:05.838]  Arrest some college kids.
[02:03:06.658 --> 02:03:08.339]  All we're allowed to do is arrest college kids.
[02:03:09.719 --> 02:03:10.839]  And we don't even want to do it.
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:25.104]  Because they are not allowed to enforce the law, they enforce the criminal hatred that the globalists have for America, and for anybody that's American, because in these wars,
[02:03:26.195 --> 02:03:30.298]  If you study history, the globalists hate the seed of America.
[02:03:31.639 --> 02:03:39.745]  They hate the culture, the idea, not of all the bad things America's done, but the good things America did were so revolutionary.
[02:03:40.165 --> 02:03:41.406]  Everyone in the world wanted to come here.
[02:03:41.686 --> 02:03:42.467]  It was special.
[02:03:49.992 --> 02:03:55.536]  It's that quote from The Last of the Mohicans, right towards the end.
[02:03:57.386 --> 02:04:04.232]  In the fight scene, where the two, you know, alpha Native Americans battle to the death.
[02:04:08.055 --> 02:04:15.522]  And he says to him, I'm gonna kill you, and I'm gonna kill your daughters, and I'm gonna wipe your seed off the face of this earth.
[02:04:18.749 --> 02:04:19.950]  That's real power, folks.
[02:04:20.430 --> 02:04:26.674]  The globalists aren't just attacking humans, they're attacking the trees, they're attacking the fish, the amphibians.
[02:04:27.655 --> 02:04:33.818]  They're genetically re-engineering everything with horrible consequences.
[02:04:39.362 --> 02:04:41.103]  And then they run the environmental movement.
[02:04:43.814 --> 02:04:51.959]  Again, so we're all distracted onto what plants breathe as the scourge, not just the hundreds of horrible things that are going on.
[02:04:52.799 --> 02:04:53.900]  That's what I'm saying, folks.
[02:04:53.960 --> 02:04:56.141]  I mean, it's like the elite.
[02:04:57.442 --> 02:04:59.403]  Our evil space aliens come here to destroy us.
[02:04:59.443 --> 02:05:00.404]  I mean, they're that bad.
[02:05:01.385 --> 02:05:03.746]  I mean, they really are that bad.
[02:05:03.806 --> 02:05:05.307]  We are in the hands of pure evil.
[02:05:05.787 --> 02:05:06.668]  That's what I'm getting at here.
[02:05:08.720 --> 02:05:15.784]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:05:15.864 --> 02:05:18.025]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:05:18.225 --> 02:05:23.327]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:05:23.487 --> 02:05:28.430]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:05:28.670 --> 02:05:31.733]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:05:31.993 --> 02:05:35.856]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:05:36.056 --> 02:05:40.300]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:05:40.380 --> 02:05:50.409]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:05:50.629 --> 02:05:53.131]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs
[02:05:53.311 --> 02:06:01.375]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:06:01.515 --> 02:06:05.497]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:06:08.612 --> 02:06:14.778]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[02:06:14.798 --> 02:06:18.120]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[02:06:18.140 --> 02:06:19.822]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant!
[02:06:19.842 --> 02:06:26.148]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[02:06:26.248 --> 02:06:32.133]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[02:06:32.293 --> 02:06:36.055]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[02:06:36.235 --> 02:06:39.136]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[02:06:39.156 --> 02:06:47.319]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[02:06:47.600 --> 02:06:49.640]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[02:06:49.700 --> 02:06:50.741]  It's a war against the truth.
[02:06:51.101 --> 02:06:59.853]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[02:07:08.624 --> 02:07:10.505]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[02:07:10.845 --> 02:07:18.788]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:07:18.888 --> 02:07:26.171]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:07:26.451 --> 02:07:30.713]  I just received my Male Vitality about three days ago and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[02:07:31.033 --> 02:07:41.238]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[02:07:41.658 --> 02:07:47.822]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:07:48.142 --> 02:07:50.383]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:07:50.503 --> 02:07:54.345]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and getting the day started.
[02:07:54.525 --> 02:07:56.127]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[02:07:56.487 --> 02:08:00.412]  All the products in Infowarslife.com are simply amazing.
[02:08:00.652 --> 02:08:07.581]  Visit Infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from Infowarslife.
[02:08:20.080 --> 02:08:24.023]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:08:24.483 --> 02:08:26.005]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:33.310 --> 02:08:39.855]  And if you are listening or watching this emergency global transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:40.936 --> 02:08:46.440]  I'm just a normal person, folks, who about 22 years ago discovered a lot of the crimes being conducted by
[02:08:48.030 --> 02:09:05.495]  Offshore anti-free market corporate interest through governments in an attempt to shut down free markets while blaming free markets for their kleptocratic brand of socialism on the bottom to domesticate the public fascism sitting on top now I've used my own
[02:09:06.195 --> 02:09:06.435]  I think?
[02:09:36.277 --> 02:09:36.938]  Can defeat them.
[02:09:38.479 --> 02:09:48.146]  If one guy from Texas can reach 3 million, 4 million people a day, 15, 20 million people a week, conservatively, what can you do in your area?
[02:09:48.967 --> 02:09:57.694]  And I don't want to start this interview talking about myself, but I never got to this earlier, because I got, my flight got cancelled last night, getting back in the country, and then I was late an hour into the show getting here.
[02:09:57.714 --> 02:10:00.656]  I just want to make this point, we're going to our guest, and I want to ask him this up front.
[02:10:04.588 --> 02:10:06.689]  But when I say it's the best of times, worst of times.
[02:10:06.729 --> 02:10:09.089]  We're getting some good Supreme Court rulings, a lot of them.
[02:10:10.470 --> 02:10:16.432]  Not just the fact that you can have companies that don't have to pay for abortions, basically, like Hobby Lobby.
[02:10:17.452 --> 02:10:19.373]  And we're seeing some other good rulings out of them.
[02:10:21.233 --> 02:10:25.935]  And we're seeing more and more people talk about crony capitalism versus real capitalism.
[02:10:25.975 --> 02:10:32.197]  We're seeing billionaires come out and more and more tell it like it is.
[02:10:33.683 --> 02:10:36.664]  Like Donald Trump, saying that prepare for financial ruin.
[02:10:37.745 --> 02:10:46.389]  And we're seeing more and more of the media, even MSNBC and CNN, and especially CNBC, they'll say, oh yeah, there are crony capitalists that like wrecking things.
[02:10:46.409 --> 02:10:51.952]  I mean, folks are starting to get a basic self-preservation instinct.
[02:10:59.475 --> 02:11:02.437]  And people better, because here's the big issue.
[02:11:04.918 --> 02:11:27.901]  If, for three weeks, Congress, as the National Review has published, with a letter by a representative from Oklahoma, if members of Congress aren't allowed into these military bases, and there's private security strutting around, and they've detained our reporters for even trying to go shoot video through the fence,
[02:11:29.116 --> 02:11:33.617]  And you've got a culture of total lying, and they're busing the illegals in that don't even have skills.
[02:11:33.637 --> 02:11:34.558]  They're not even skilled workers.
[02:11:35.858 --> 02:11:36.678]  Criminals, you name it.
[02:11:38.699 --> 02:11:40.360]  The question is, what comes next?
[02:11:40.620 --> 02:11:43.101]  Well, here's another issue for the establishment.
[02:11:43.121 --> 02:11:47.202]  This is what I want to bring up with Mr. Dent, who's about to join us.
[02:11:48.735 --> 02:11:50.756]  You've got all this craziness going on.
[02:11:51.457 --> 02:11:53.919]  A lot of good things happening, but also a lot of bad things happening.
[02:11:54.399 --> 02:11:56.701]  But the establishment acts like they don't care.
[02:11:57.241 --> 02:11:59.403]  Like they know something we don't know.
[02:11:59.763 --> 02:12:00.824]  And they're just invincible.
[02:12:02.093 --> 02:12:14.019]  I mean, Obama, in the first campaign, and again in the last campaign, took about a third of his donations offshore, through websites, with even fake names and stuff, each case a felony, and never got in trouble.
[02:12:14.560 --> 02:12:29.528]  I mean, that's just one example of the legions of crimes that are going on, while they then use the IRS to persecute, you know, the institutes and things that promote conservative financial ideas, or pro-life groups.
[02:12:29.768 --> 02:12:31.409]  It's real tyranny, is what I'm saying.
[02:12:32.683 --> 02:12:52.285]  And then meanwhile I'm in the airport yesterday to see this dichotomy in Houston and I go to the TSA and I don't want to be put in the naked body scanner so they get all angry at me and act like I've done something wrong and then I explain to them that they know full well it's all a fraud and they basically let me through and then I go through customs
[02:12:55.612 --> 02:13:11.521]  And the guy's a listener, and said he only got the job because, you know, he had family that died in 9-11, he's retired military, and then he knows the whole thing's fraud, and government runs ISIS, and, uh, yeah, they put an X on your thing here to be searched and harassed, but this is all a load of crap I'm sending you through.
[02:13:12.022 --> 02:13:13.983]  You have no criminal record, I listen to your show every day.
[02:13:16.260 --> 02:13:17.942]  By the way, I was waiting for what happened there.
[02:13:17.982 --> 02:13:18.702]  I even recorded it.
[02:13:18.722 --> 02:13:19.483]  I don't think I'm going to air it.
[02:13:19.503 --> 02:13:20.704]  Don't want to get the guy in trouble.
[02:13:21.044 --> 02:13:25.228]  The point is, is that he said, yeah, the machines are taking over.
[02:13:25.248 --> 02:13:33.515]  That program machine that we don't even know who put stuff in it tries to keep, you name it, from even coming into the country.
[02:13:33.896 --> 02:13:35.977]  He goes, congressmen have trouble getting back in the country.
[02:13:36.758 --> 02:13:39.480]  You have trouble getting back in the country, but the illegals can come right in.
[02:13:39.860 --> 02:13:45.763]  You see, that's why they want computers in there, so that it's all centralized and people can't say no to the tyranny.
[02:13:46.304 --> 02:13:48.585]  But there was that dichotomy, and then when I was in the Caribbean...
[02:13:51.434 --> 02:13:56.116]  In places like Grand Cayman, I mean, I was mobbed more than even I am in Austin, Texas.
[02:13:56.196 --> 02:13:58.637]  I mean, mobbed by the people at the hotel.
[02:13:59.157 --> 02:14:01.378]  Mobbed at other hotels by the staff.
[02:14:01.398 --> 02:14:04.439]  I went to the Ritz-Carlton for dinner with some friends.
[02:14:04.899 --> 02:14:05.679]  Just incredible.
[02:14:07.420 --> 02:14:13.602]  Just everywhere I went, at the airports, the police were listeners.
[02:14:13.702 --> 02:14:18.244]  It was just completely blowing me away that they all got it on that island.
[02:14:20.100 --> 02:14:23.521]  So there is hope, because I'm not bragging, hey, Alex Jones is a big deal.
[02:14:24.882 --> 02:14:26.643]  I'm saying liberty is popular.
[02:14:27.323 --> 02:14:30.024]  Legalizing freedom is popular, as Ron Paul says.
[02:14:30.725 --> 02:14:32.785]  And we're selling snow cones in hell.
[02:14:34.246 --> 02:14:37.748]  They're selling lighting people on fire on the 4th of July.
[02:14:38.068 --> 02:14:40.029]  People don't want to be burned up, folks.
[02:14:40.069 --> 02:14:40.949]  They want a snow cone.
[02:14:41.889 --> 02:14:44.791]  And the system is creating a hell right now.
[02:14:45.351 --> 02:14:47.672]  We're joined for the rest of the hour by Harry Dent.
[02:14:49.212 --> 02:14:50.232]  He's a best-selling author.
[02:14:50.252 --> 02:14:52.093]  Made a lot of accurate predictions.
[02:14:52.113 --> 02:14:54.194]  Of course, was a top analyst for Bain Capital.
[02:14:55.615 --> 02:15:00.577]  And he's been on the show four or five times as a popular guest.
[02:15:00.597 --> 02:15:01.577]  We appreciate him coming back on.
[02:15:01.857 --> 02:15:02.638]  His new book's out.
[02:15:02.678 --> 02:15:15.743]  He's offering our listeners, it's a nice thing he's sent along, at harrydent.com forward slash Alex Jones, a free chapter from his book and more with some of the key charts and things we're going to be showing here today.
[02:15:15.763 --> 02:15:16.843]  And I want to get into that with him.
[02:15:16.863 --> 02:15:17.944]  I want to debate
[02:15:19.105 --> 02:15:20.766]  Uh, inflation, deflation with him.
[02:15:20.806 --> 02:15:26.087]  Not that I even disagree with him, but I want to go through these nuances with a technical guy, just with my layman view.
[02:15:26.327 --> 02:15:28.748]  Maybe he can explain some of these paradoxes to me.
[02:15:29.308 --> 02:15:36.230]  But first, the last five minutes, you heard me break down just some of my experiences, uh, being out of the country, coming back to the country.
[02:15:36.470 --> 02:15:37.531]  The border is wide open.
[02:15:37.551 --> 02:15:40.351]  The government pays to ship illegals in on the buses.
[02:15:40.371 --> 02:15:42.012]  We have video of it and them admitting it.
[02:15:43.194 --> 02:15:50.606]  Obama won't admit it and says it's ridiculous we should have amnesty to fix this when they already are causing it by giving them fiat.
[02:15:52.140 --> 02:15:52.661]  Amnesty.
[02:15:53.041 --> 02:15:55.382]  People are waking up, but still things are getting worse.
[02:15:55.722 --> 02:15:57.123]  The elite are acting like they don't care.
[02:15:57.484 --> 02:16:02.887]  In five minutes before we go to break, or I'll skip the break, explain to me your perspective on what's happening.
[02:16:03.167 --> 02:16:05.388]  I mean, is this like Caligula marrying his horse?
[02:16:05.949 --> 02:16:07.430]  Are Nero committing suicide?
[02:16:07.470 --> 02:16:10.672]  I mean, is the elite going insane, like Hitler attacking Russia?
[02:16:11.092 --> 02:16:14.194]  Or is there some method to this, Mr. Dent?
[02:16:15.495 --> 02:16:16.756]  Well, no, it's not to me.
[02:16:16.796 --> 02:16:20.039]  Like he said before, people are destroying natural systems.
[02:16:20.199 --> 02:16:26.324]  Free market capitalism is a natural, organic, biological system that needs the dynamics of opposites.
[02:16:27.104 --> 02:16:28.746]  It is being overmanaged.
[02:16:28.766 --> 02:16:31.788]  They're trying to run the economy like it's a machine.
[02:16:31.808 --> 02:16:32.909]  You know, they're not.
[02:16:32.929 --> 02:16:33.309]  They don't.
[02:16:33.349 --> 02:16:35.771]  We have the worst immigration policies in the world.
[02:16:35.831 --> 02:16:39.755]  I'm just back from Australia in February, about to go back in July again.
[02:16:40.035 --> 02:16:41.336]  They have the best immigration.
[02:16:41.816 --> 02:16:45.118]  You know, you have to be qualified to get in.
[02:16:45.758 --> 02:16:47.619]  They attract the people they want.
[02:16:47.659 --> 02:16:49.540]  You can't just run across the borders.
[02:16:49.580 --> 02:16:51.841]  They're surrounded by an ocean, so that makes it a little easier for them.
[02:16:52.361 --> 02:16:56.323]  We've got horrible immigration policies, but we have even worse financial policies.
[02:16:56.363 --> 02:17:02.647]  The government is basically running our economy now on artificial drugs, and that never works out well.
[02:17:02.947 --> 02:17:05.608]  They're not allowing debts to rebalance.
[02:17:05.628 --> 02:17:09.350]  They're not allowing bubbles to rebalance and the economy to rebalance.
[02:17:09.370 --> 02:17:10.891]  They're just saying the economy can't slow down.
[02:17:11.911 --> 02:17:13.112]  over the economy.
[02:17:13.653 --> 02:17:17.755]  Again, trying to run it like it's an inorganic machine, which it's not.
[02:17:17.815 --> 02:17:25.761]  So, you know, I hear all the stuff you say about, you know, pollution in the environment, you know, modified foods.
[02:17:25.801 --> 02:17:36.728]  Well, I mean, I just listen to guys saying, you know, our intestines are all screwed up because we overuse drugs and antibiotics so much that we've killed all the good bacteria while fighting the bad.
[02:17:36.768 --> 02:17:38.910]  I mean, we don't have enough respect for
[02:17:39.350 --> 02:17:40.950]  Or the wisdom of natural systems.
[02:17:41.091 --> 02:17:45.752]  Adam Smith said it, you know, the invisible hand, how our economy runs from the bottoms up.
[02:17:45.812 --> 02:17:53.654]  If you just set some good rules and let it, let innovation happen and let booms and busts happen and let inflation and deflation happen.
[02:17:53.694 --> 02:17:57.495]  In my work, inflation and deflation are the critical
[02:17:58.395 --> 02:18:00.757]  Um, incentives for innovation.
[02:18:00.857 --> 02:18:05.879]  And if you don't allow this to happen, and most of the innovations happen in bus, not in boom.
[02:18:06.419 --> 02:18:08.441]  And then they come into our economy in the boom.
[02:18:08.481 --> 02:18:13.463]  So economists to me, politicians do not understand our economy.
[02:18:13.503 --> 02:18:15.124]  They have kind of hijacked it.
[02:18:15.404 --> 02:18:17.225]  They are running it for elite interest.
[02:18:17.265 --> 02:18:22.448]  The top 1% has run away with almost all the gains now for decades and
[02:18:23.374 --> 02:18:33.320]  By keeping this bubble going, after creating the greatest bubble in history, debt and financial assets, the government's only policy is to keep the bubble going forever.
[02:18:33.340 --> 02:18:38.283]  It keeps the top 1%, making outsized gains.
[02:18:38.864 --> 02:18:42.586]  It fosters all this inequality and polarization in society.
[02:18:42.606 --> 02:18:49.130]  It's the worst economic policies I've ever seen in history, and that tells me that it's going to end badly.
[02:18:49.170 --> 02:18:52.212]  And of course, I've been warning the last few times on your show as well that
[02:18:52.692 --> 02:18:56.455]  The Dow is going to get to somewhere like 17,000, where it is recently.
[02:18:57.535 --> 02:19:00.317]  And by the way, you said that just about a month and a half ago on the show.
[02:19:00.357 --> 02:19:01.298]  People can go back to it.
[02:19:01.618 --> 02:19:02.459]  That did come true.
[02:19:02.639 --> 02:19:03.820]  In fact, you don't like to brag.
[02:19:04.580 --> 02:19:07.642]  Folks can go to your website and see some of the past reports, harrydent.com.
[02:19:08.122 --> 02:19:12.045]  But tell some of the people out there some of the predictions you've made that have been spot on.
[02:19:12.065 --> 02:19:15.467]  I mean, you do have a very accurate prediction background here.
[02:19:15.948 --> 02:19:17.809]  That's who we have on the show, people that are accurate.
[02:19:18.069 --> 02:19:23.912]  I mean, you can tune into CNBC most days and just get a bunch of bull, because they're being literally told to put that out.
[02:19:23.932 --> 02:19:24.972]  I've talked to some behind the scenes.
[02:19:25.272 --> 02:19:29.715]  They would lose their jobs, like Dylan Radigan or whatever, if they don't play ball.
[02:19:30.735 --> 02:19:34.597]  So, recap for folks, some of the big predictions you've made that came true.
[02:19:35.117 --> 02:19:38.099]  Well, first of all, you know, the biggest tool we use, of many, is demographics.
[02:19:38.139 --> 02:19:45.964]  We know exactly when people buy the most cars, houses, when they spend the most money, borrow the most, pay for babysitting, you name it.
[02:19:45.984 --> 02:19:49.046]  There's almost nothing I don't know about the life cycle of consumers.
[02:19:49.347 --> 02:19:54.930]  And consumers are 70% of our GDP, and businesses who invest when consumers are growing are another 10.
[02:19:55.331 --> 02:19:56.551]  Government's only 20, thank God.
[02:19:57.932 --> 02:20:00.134]  So we use demographics to predict trends.
[02:20:00.975 --> 02:20:13.985]  When I first got these tools in late 89, I came out with my first book and we predicted simultaneously that Japan would see a giant crash in the 1990s, while the US and Europe would see the greatest boom in history.
[02:20:14.066 --> 02:20:16.808]  People thought we were absolutely nuts.
[02:20:17.388 --> 02:20:26.751]  Then in the early 90s, when we had the recession that we predicted, we said, no, we're going to come out of this, and the Dow is going to hit 10,000 or higher by the early 2000s, and that happened.
[02:20:27.092 --> 02:20:30.893]  We called the tech peak in February and April.
[02:20:30.913 --> 02:20:39.376]  We called the internet peak in February and the NASDAQ peak in April, just within one month of the peak, and said, look, this bubble, this is a peak.
[02:20:39.436 --> 02:20:40.516]  It's going to start to burst.
[02:20:40.957 --> 02:20:42.817]  Then we called the housing peak in late 2005.
[02:20:42.937 --> 02:20:43.277]  I literally
[02:20:45.547 --> 02:20:53.193]  Moved from Miami to Tampa in that time period, sold my house in Miami, rented in Tampa, saved a fortune.
[02:20:53.213 --> 02:20:54.634]  So I practice what I preach.
[02:20:55.074 --> 02:21:03.560]  And we've been saying now for 20 years that in late 2007, the baby boomers would peak in spending and we would start to move into a downward economy.
[02:21:03.600 --> 02:21:06.843]  Well, we did get our big crash in 2008, right on cue.
[02:21:07.183 --> 02:21:09.745]  But governments have just said, well, we won't let that happen anymore.
[02:21:09.765 --> 02:21:11.086]  We won't let the economy go down.
[02:21:11.106 --> 02:21:12.267]  We won't let banks fail.
[02:21:12.307 --> 02:21:12.727]  We won't let
[02:21:13.127 --> 02:21:13.908]  Companies fail.
[02:21:13.928 --> 02:21:21.115]  We won't let debts be restructured or entitlements, which are just off the charts unaffordable.
[02:21:21.155 --> 02:21:31.845]  So they're preventing the very crisis that could rebalance our economy, get rid of this top 1% running away with all the games and everything, but they won't do it.
[02:21:32.186 --> 02:21:34.888]  And so what's going to happen instead, they just created a bubble.
[02:21:34.928 --> 02:21:36.430]  They created a bigger bubble again.
[02:21:37.210 --> 02:21:44.114]  And we've been telling people and over the last several months, somewhere around Dow 17,000, a little higher, this bubble is going to peak.
[02:21:44.194 --> 02:21:45.174]  It's going to peak soon.
[02:21:45.634 --> 02:21:52.638]  And the next crash is going to take us to lower lows than we saw in 2009, about 5,000 to 6,000 on the Dow.
[02:21:52.678 --> 02:21:56.060]  That's a very clear pattern, higher highs in each bubble peak.
[02:21:56.640 --> 02:21:58.042]  Lower lows in each crash.
[02:21:58.062 --> 02:22:02.990]  The government keeps stimulating to try to avoid the crisis but only creates a bigger crisis down the road.
[02:22:03.030 --> 02:22:05.894]  Just like taking more drugs to keep from coming down.
[02:22:05.914 --> 02:22:08.357]  That's exactly what they're doing for natural drugs.
[02:22:08.477 --> 02:22:12.103]  Quantitative easing is basically like crack for the economy.
[02:22:13.482 --> 02:22:25.190]  Again, if you've just joined us, you can visit the website harrydent.com forward slash Alex Jones and you can get unpublished chapter, so it's an unpublished chapter, that's even better, of the Demographic Cliff book that's already a bestseller.
[02:22:25.210 --> 02:22:38.558]  We're going to go through some of those graphs today as well if you're a TV viewer watching at prisonplanet.tv or infowars.com forward slash show to find the free feed of the daytime broadcast and transmission.
[02:22:39.139 --> 02:22:40.560]  Now, continuing with Harry Dent,
[02:22:41.374 --> 02:22:42.796]  If you just tuned in, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:22:43.256 --> 02:22:47.681]  We're talking about where the world is today and so many people send me emails.
[02:22:48.001 --> 02:22:53.827]  It is a minority, but I do get a lot of them and I get it on the street or when I do radio interviews or TV interviews.
[02:22:55.009 --> 02:22:56.911]  Alex, why are you such a pessimist?
[02:22:56.991 --> 02:22:58.192]  Why are you complaining?
[02:22:58.252 --> 02:23:00.894]  Why are you saying this is bad or this is terrible?
[02:23:01.174 --> 02:23:04.056]  Well, it's because I want to differentiate what's good from bad.
[02:23:04.517 --> 02:23:09.140]  I socially want to wake people up to try to make the world a freer, more open place.
[02:23:09.200 --> 02:23:14.444]  Now, if someone disagrees with me about what my views are, that's fine, but it's my free speech.
[02:23:15.225 --> 02:23:19.708]  But denying all these trends that are as clear as the nose on my face or your face
[02:23:20.729 --> 02:23:27.814]  Is the stuff of societal collapse, and if we don't reverse this, we have a managed economy like Japan or Venezuela.
[02:23:28.755 --> 02:23:29.916]  Two different managed systems.
[02:23:30.256 --> 02:23:36.381]  One of them managed much better, but still in a 20-year recession slash depression, with signs of total societal collapse.
[02:23:36.441 --> 02:23:37.381]  Nobody's having kids.
[02:23:37.882 --> 02:23:39.783]  You look at Venezuela, they can't keep the lights on.
[02:23:39.803 --> 02:23:45.848]  I mean, we know that managed systems don't work, and we know that there's this tiny elite
[02:23:46.857 --> 02:24:03.689]  That are scapegoating the free market while they run away with all the gains, creating a giant piranha-like underclass that they are using politically to fully socialize the once great Western nations because the globalists are exempt in most cases from what they've done to us.
[02:24:03.749 --> 02:24:07.032]  So what I'm asking you is, how do we politically
[02:24:07.452 --> 02:24:12.474]  I understand it's important to know these trends and understand them so we can individually take care of ourselves and be in a better position.
[02:24:12.734 --> 02:24:14.155]  Maybe even, you know, thrive from it.
[02:24:14.435 --> 02:24:16.816]  That's a very moral and smart thing to do.
[02:24:17.737 --> 02:24:21.378]  But at the same time, what do you say about political hope?
[02:24:21.438 --> 02:24:27.881]  I mean, there's some huge awakening happening on one side, but also incredible arrogance by the ruling class on the other.
[02:24:28.221 --> 02:24:29.742]  So where does all this go?
[02:24:30.851 --> 02:24:36.056]  Well, you know, Ali, the only hope I have, and this is exactly what I see happen, a crisis is what gets people clear.
[02:24:36.176 --> 02:24:37.037]  I am just like you.
[02:24:37.157 --> 02:24:39.739]  I am crystal clear on debt trends.
[02:24:39.759 --> 02:24:40.820]  They're off the charts.
[02:24:40.860 --> 02:24:43.543]  The greatest debt bubble in history, and that never ends well.
[02:24:43.863 --> 02:24:46.105]  Entitlements are even worse than that.
[02:24:46.125 --> 02:24:51.110]  We never even had entitlements in the Great Depression when that debt bubble and financial bubble burst.
[02:24:51.150 --> 02:24:52.491]  We got financial assets.
[02:24:53.011 --> 02:25:09.878]  Overvalued again, more than ever, about to burst, and we're going to see a crisis because a lot of wealth is going to disappear in these bubble bursts, and a lot of banks are going to have to fail when people realize the government can't just artificially create growth forever when the demographic trends and the debt trends are down.
[02:25:09.918 --> 02:25:11.899]  So I'm clear on this, but I'm also clear
[02:25:12.882 --> 02:25:13.842]  Unlike economists.
[02:25:14.322 --> 02:25:16.603]  They're saying that China is the new model.
[02:25:16.723 --> 02:25:18.043]  State-driven capitalism.
[02:25:18.063 --> 02:25:20.024]  And I'm like, you have to be kidding me.
[02:25:20.444 --> 02:25:24.645]  China makes Japan or any other managed system look like nothing.
[02:25:24.725 --> 02:25:29.847]  China has over-expanded, over-managed their economy from top to bottom.
[02:25:29.887 --> 02:25:31.687]  And talk about crony capitalism.
[02:25:31.947 --> 02:25:36.989]  The way you get rich in China is you're the friend with the local Communist Party mafia leader.
[02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:38.089]  And that's what it is.
[02:25:38.149 --> 02:25:39.149]  It's a big mafia.
[02:25:39.229 --> 02:25:40.070]  China has 27%.
[02:25:41.950 --> 02:25:43.332]  Let me just stop you for a minute.
[02:25:56.647 --> 02:25:57.107]  We're good to go.
[02:26:11.935 --> 02:26:13.536]  Sure, sure, well they're going to use...
[02:26:38.106 --> 02:26:44.792]  Well, I mean, in the brains of the socialist bean counters, the collapsing things gives them more power so that they think they're going to survive it.
[02:26:45.072 --> 02:26:48.395]  But if we politically expose them, this could really be the end of them.
[02:26:48.495 --> 02:26:49.055]  I agree with you.
[02:26:49.316 --> 02:26:52.799]  The crisis they've been helping create and exacerbate
[02:26:53.539 --> 02:26:59.043]  Is there downfall if we simply tell the truth with a narrative against their narrative?
[02:26:59.403 --> 02:27:02.064]  Our narrative, the truth, will defeat their narrative, the lie.
[02:27:02.104 --> 02:27:04.946]  But looking at China, you hit the nail on the head right there.
[02:27:05.006 --> 02:27:05.887]  Nobody brings this up.
[02:27:06.247 --> 02:27:11.971]  When I look at Europe and the US as elites, what upsets me about the real controlling socialist elite
[02:27:12.891 --> 02:27:27.122]  Is that A, they're exempt from what they're doing to the rest of us, but B, they're so anti-freedom, anti-market, anti-mail, anti-independence that they don't even want to lifeblood in their own system that they've...
[02:27:27.822 --> 02:27:28.583]  Got control of.
[02:27:28.883 --> 02:27:47.836]  But then they embrace, in the Economist magazine every month, I guess you're talking about that, I see it everywhere, China that has suicide nets, mobile execution vans, forced abortions in their factories, just stuff off the chart evil, rivers getting set on fire, they're so toxic, and then this is the model
[02:27:49.082 --> 02:27:55.224]  A bunch of Chinese generals that are tax-exempt making millions of dollars with their corrupt little royalty mafia families.
[02:27:55.464 --> 02:28:06.947]  I know I'm ranting here, Harry, but the fact that our elite loves the Chinese model, the Chinese communist state-run model, shows you how much trouble we're in.
[02:28:07.799 --> 02:28:11.701]  Yeah, you know, these people who love this model ought to go over there and choke on the smog.
[02:28:11.761 --> 02:28:14.682]  And like you say, they're the most polluted environment.
[02:28:14.702 --> 02:28:16.583]  They're creating the most pollution in the world.
[02:28:17.403 --> 02:28:21.485]  They're adding the most to this global bubble that is just going to burst.
[02:28:21.886 --> 02:28:24.067]  And again, that's what we'll talk later about deflation.
[02:28:24.087 --> 02:28:30.670]  When you get bubbles burst, when wealth disappears, when debts fail and get restructured, money disappears.
[02:28:31.850 --> 02:28:47.319]  Disappears and you get look fewer dollars chasing the same good you get deflation not inflation And all this over capacity and over building any China's pretty much overbuilt their economy for the next 12 years in advance
[02:28:47.819 --> 02:28:48.139]  I think?
[02:29:05.526 --> 02:29:06.847]  That's an economist's dream.
[02:29:07.127 --> 02:29:17.230]  But if you look at it and you get this chapter, believe me, the reason I'm putting all this stuff out like you is I'm going to be there to say I told you so because people do need to learn.
[02:29:17.270 --> 02:29:18.730]  We are going to get this crisis.
[02:29:18.750 --> 02:29:20.631]  You cannot keep a bubble going forever.
[02:29:20.931 --> 02:29:22.892]  You cannot manipulate our economy forever.
[02:29:22.912 --> 02:29:26.513]  You can't take more and more financial drugs and not have consequences.
[02:29:26.813 --> 02:29:36.680]  So this crisis is going to hit, but people need to understand why it happened, and what the cause of it was, so we don't repeat these mistakes, and so these people do lose credibility.
[02:29:36.700 --> 02:29:37.300]  That's right, Harry.
[02:29:37.320 --> 02:29:37.921]  We've got to go to break.
[02:29:37.941 --> 02:29:39.281]  The spread is screwing our economy.
[02:29:39.902 --> 02:29:41.243]  Harry Dent's our guest.
[02:29:41.283 --> 02:29:42.043]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:42.664 --> 02:29:45.446]  Dave Bratton, Virginia, just won the primary, as folks know.
[02:29:46.086 --> 02:29:46.987]  He's an economist.
[02:29:47.227 --> 02:29:48.768]  Sounds just like Mr. Dent.
[02:29:49.648 --> 02:29:51.430]  This is a popular idea, folks.
[02:29:51.950 --> 02:29:55.672]  We're going to break it all down the other side, and look at where the economy's going.
[02:29:55.993 --> 02:29:56.433]  Stay with us.
[02:29:58.037 --> 02:30:01.046]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:30:01.988 --> 02:30:04.676]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:08.777 --> 02:30:12.778]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:30:12.818 --> 02:30:16.959]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:30:17.180 --> 02:30:20.601]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:30:20.841 --> 02:30:23.722]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:30:23.862 --> 02:30:31.224]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:30:31.444 --> 02:30:35.085]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:30:35.305 --> 02:30:39.586]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:30:39.766 --> 02:30:45.688]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:30:45.728 --> 02:30:46.408]  Fluoride.
[02:30:46.588 --> 02:30:47.049]  Is it tea?
[02:30:47.069 --> 02:30:47.669]  Is it coffee?
[02:30:47.689 --> 02:30:48.229]  Is it water?
[02:30:48.249 --> 02:30:48.709]  Is it bread?
[02:30:48.729 --> 02:30:49.509]  Is it toothpaste?
[02:30:49.669 --> 02:30:52.210]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:30:52.410 --> 02:30:53.771]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:30:53.911 --> 02:30:55.151]  It's time to take action.
[02:30:55.291 --> 02:30:56.992]  It's time to filter our water.
[02:30:57.112 --> 02:31:04.234]  Visit InfoWarsThor.com and use promo code WATER to get 10% off their entire family of incredible products.
[02:31:09.356 --> 02:31:15.279]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:31:15.499 --> 02:31:19.701]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:31:20.062 --> 02:31:24.624]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:31:25.044 --> 02:31:27.646]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:31:27.966 --> 02:31:33.149]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:31:33.410 --> 02:31:40.294]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:31:40.794 --> 02:31:44.577]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:31:44.917 --> 02:31:49.720]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:50.040 --> 02:31:50.901]  This is innovating.
[02:31:51.181 --> 02:31:58.466]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:31:58.666 --> 02:32:02.708]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[02:32:09.619 --> 02:32:11.400]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[02:32:11.921 --> 02:32:18.885]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[02:32:19.345 --> 02:32:29.772]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[02:32:30.173 --> 02:32:39.399]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[02:32:40.139 --> 02:32:43.540]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[02:32:44.200 --> 02:32:47.600]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[02:32:47.961 --> 02:32:49.521]  Experience the new formula.
[02:32:50.021 --> 02:32:51.981]  Experience the ancient purity.
[02:32:52.581 --> 02:32:53.542]  Shield your family.
[02:32:53.922 --> 02:32:55.302]  Survival Shield X2.

[02:33:20.275 --> 02:33:22.176]  Escape from the New World Order.
[02:33:23.657 --> 02:33:25.258]  Need to have a new movie with Kurt Russell.
[02:33:27.900 --> 02:33:29.962]  Directed by John Garbinder.
[02:33:32.504 --> 02:33:34.305]  We need to get Rowdy Piper back on.
[02:33:34.986 --> 02:33:37.728]  When we had him on last year about They Live, that was awesome.
[02:33:38.783 --> 02:33:40.265]  We're going to go back to Harry Dent.
[02:33:40.285 --> 02:33:43.989]  Again, you can go to harrydent.com forward slash alexjones.
[02:33:44.009 --> 02:33:45.631]  He's got an unpublished chapter.
[02:33:46.091 --> 02:33:49.515]  I kind of halfway read this because I got in late today with the flights.
[02:33:50.456 --> 02:33:52.358]  And I was like, oh, is he supposed to have one of his chapters?
[02:33:52.398 --> 02:33:52.979]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:33:53.339 --> 02:33:56.963]  He already had some of the chapters I saw up on the side a few months ago when it first came out.
[02:33:58.953 --> 02:34:01.513]  This is an unpublished one that really came out after the book.
[02:34:01.533 --> 02:34:04.574]  And we're going to talk about his predictions now.
[02:34:05.494 --> 02:34:12.255]  And perhaps he can explain to myself and others out there what he's getting at saying it's deflation, not inflation.
[02:34:12.315 --> 02:34:15.276]  And I just want to talk to him about what I'm seeing.
[02:34:15.316 --> 02:34:19.577]  But tomorrow, and I may even do like an hour overdrive today because I got here late.
[02:34:20.437 --> 02:34:21.797]  Some stations carry that fourth hour.
[02:34:21.817 --> 02:34:24.718]  I want to get into a bunch of this news and take your phone calls.
[02:34:24.738 --> 02:34:26.758]  I'm not sure if I have time to do that yet.
[02:34:27.961 --> 02:34:28.421]  We'll see.
[02:34:29.062 --> 02:34:33.524]  I'm just more reflective now, because I like to scuba dive, I like to snorkel.
[02:34:33.984 --> 02:34:53.813]  I never get to do it, so I went down to the Caribbean, and I'd be on the boat, and they'd be being real nice to me with all those other people on the boat, you know, going snorkeling or scuba diving or going out to see the stingrays or going out to be on a wreck, and they would just, it was, can we have a photo now at the end?
[02:34:53.873 --> 02:34:54.913]  And I'd say, what's going on?
[02:34:54.993 --> 02:34:55.954]  Oh, we're all listeners.
[02:34:58.700 --> 02:35:06.327]  And again, one of the tour guides would be, you know, a cop who also runs a company to go out and see the wreck.
[02:35:07.068 --> 02:35:15.496]  Or it would then be, I mean, I did probably like six or seven of these tours, sometimes two a day, and every time they were listeners.
[02:35:18.357 --> 02:35:21.439]  I'd be in a grocery store and a cop would walk by and go, Alex Jones!
[02:35:22.380 --> 02:35:23.241]  Like what you're doing!
[02:35:24.001 --> 02:35:28.325]  I'd be in a dive shop and there'd be, you know, three black Caribbean guys in there.
[02:35:28.865 --> 02:35:30.126]  They'd all go, that voice!
[02:35:30.166 --> 02:35:31.107]  You're Alex Jones!
[02:35:31.167 --> 02:35:32.087]  I like what you say!
[02:35:32.167 --> 02:35:33.228]  I have a lot of the same views!
[02:35:33.529 --> 02:35:34.109]  We listen!
[02:35:35.490 --> 02:35:37.952]  And again, I'm not up here bragging, hey I got a bunch of listeners!
[02:35:38.893 --> 02:35:45.918]  What I'm saying is, we should be able to turn this around if Tea Party candidates are winning, not just here but in Europe.
[02:35:47.148 --> 02:35:54.050]  Le Pen and the UKIP party all over Europe, I mean, they got the biggest gains in the EU election.
[02:35:57.710 --> 02:35:58.671]  And it's happening here.
[02:35:58.691 --> 02:36:01.371]  So we're going to go back to Mr. Dent here in a moment.
[02:36:01.511 --> 02:36:04.152]  I just want to tell people, this is exciting.
[02:36:05.552 --> 02:36:14.094]  Because I learned, in this particular Caribbean island, they would never say anything when you're at a restaurant, or wouldn't say anything when you'd gone out and done your trip, and at the end they would say, I'm a listener.
[02:36:15.376 --> 02:36:17.681]  Or they'd be sitting there holding me in, like, reverence.
[02:36:18.924 --> 02:36:20.547]  And I could tell, I'd go, are you a listener?
[02:36:20.607 --> 02:36:23.474]  Well, I didn't want to bother you, sir, but we really appreciate you.
[02:36:23.494 --> 02:36:25.257]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[02:36:26.565 --> 02:36:28.846]  Amazing that I can go to England.
[02:36:28.986 --> 02:36:34.807]  People saw live feeds of this on the, at Bilderberg two years ago, or now a year and a half ago.
[02:36:35.387 --> 02:36:41.849]  And I just go to Big Ben, do a live feed, and there's people walking by, by the scores, and like half of them are stopping.
[02:36:41.889 --> 02:36:42.449]  Alex Jones!
[02:36:42.529 --> 02:36:42.849]  Alex Jones!
[02:36:43.509 --> 02:36:53.871]  Quite frankly, I don't know where these numbers are at, because we have millions a day we can track to visit the sites, listen to the show, and AM and FM stuff, but I don't know where the numbers are, where it's all coming from.
[02:36:53.952 --> 02:36:54.392]  YouTube?
[02:36:54.772 --> 02:36:55.412]  That can't be it.
[02:36:56.212 --> 02:36:59.974]  All I'm telling you is, government has a 7% approval rating right now.
[02:37:01.154 --> 02:37:02.415]  We should be able to beat this!
[02:37:02.895 --> 02:37:04.996]  We should be able to take the country and the world back!
[02:37:05.616 --> 02:37:06.636]  That's what I'm getting at here.
[02:37:07.737 --> 02:37:13.739]  Now, before we go back to our guest here, this whole broadcast is Lister-supported.
[02:37:13.879 --> 02:37:17.861]  I can hire more reporters, I can pay my reporters better, I can
[02:37:19.091 --> 02:37:19.931]  Get better equipment.
[02:37:19.951 --> 02:37:20.892]  You've seen the new studio.
[02:37:20.932 --> 02:37:22.592]  We'll be doing the show out of there full-time soon.
[02:37:22.852 --> 02:37:24.433]  But I've been doing a lot of special reports out of there.
[02:37:25.013 --> 02:37:27.714]  What I did last week was, before I left town, I taped a bunch of reports.
[02:37:28.034 --> 02:37:32.336]  Then they aired them live on the show with David Knight, who was live.
[02:37:32.796 --> 02:37:34.737]  But they had taped to air, obviously, my clips.
[02:37:36.257 --> 02:37:40.539]  And we're building all of this because of your support.
[02:37:40.699 --> 02:37:41.779]  And it costs a lot.
[02:37:41.939 --> 02:37:44.320]  I don't want to get into how much it costs to run this whole operation here.
[02:37:44.360 --> 02:37:46.261]  But one reason it's been successful is that I take
[02:37:48.214 --> 02:37:52.741]  It's got to be 95% of the money that comes in here and put it right back in the operation.
[02:37:53.592 --> 02:37:53.992]  We're good to go.
[02:38:23.892 --> 02:38:33.639]  And we sell the best products, the best supplements, the best Made in America t-shirts and Molon Labe belt buckles that are selling so fast they'll be gone in two weeks at this rate.
[02:38:33.999 --> 02:38:35.260]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:38:35.680 --> 02:38:38.222]  We've got the great anti-socialism shirt that's the best seller.
[02:38:39.083 --> 02:38:44.066]  We've got everything at Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, Infowarshealth.com, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[02:38:52.452 --> 02:38:54.997]  And just please continue to support us in the free market.
[02:38:56.079 --> 02:38:57.522]  This is true free association.
[02:38:58.403 --> 02:39:02.471]  A, I mean I like being a good guy and I like having high quality products I'm proud of.
[02:39:03.390 --> 02:39:05.132]  That's just normal instincts to be successful.
[02:39:05.172 --> 02:39:10.697]  Good guys, you know, end up being successful because you treat people like you want to be treated until you get a rigged system.
[02:39:11.378 --> 02:39:20.806]  But we sell the best products because I really only want to sell you the best water filters at the lowest price that really are number one and destroy the competition in gravity-fed filters pro-pure.
[02:39:21.247 --> 02:39:23.289]  I really want to sell you the best nascent iodine.
[02:39:23.589 --> 02:39:28.494]  I really want to sell you the best super male vitality that's just done amazing things for my energy, my libido, you name it.
[02:39:29.125 --> 02:39:34.367]  I really want you to get these products and get a great deal and be blown away by the quality of them.
[02:39:35.448 --> 02:39:38.089]  And then fund our operations so we can all be successful together.
[02:39:38.109 --> 02:39:42.750]  Because I'm defending family rights, the second amendment, sovereignty.
[02:39:43.771 --> 02:39:44.191]  We're here!
[02:39:45.031 --> 02:39:46.012]  Because it's survival.
[02:39:46.072 --> 02:39:47.692]  I don't deserve to be patted on the back.
[02:39:48.032 --> 02:39:49.593]  I deserve you to stand right beside me.
[02:39:49.973 --> 02:39:51.474]  That means financial support.
[02:39:52.474 --> 02:39:54.475]  And that means the armies of people that listen.
[02:39:56.494 --> 02:40:02.336]  Need to tell other people how they can listen or pass forward those videos, pass forward those news articles, those clips.
[02:40:02.717 --> 02:40:12.360]  Everybody should send a link out of harrydent.com forward slash alexjones to read about this, so when this all comes down, people then understand our credibility goes even higher.
[02:40:12.841 --> 02:40:14.781]  Why do you think the show's exploding?
[02:40:15.081 --> 02:40:17.783]  Why do you think Harry Dent's popularity is exploding?
[02:40:18.123 --> 02:40:18.983]  Or Rand Paul's?
[02:40:19.043 --> 02:40:19.663]  Or Ted Cruz?
[02:40:20.103 --> 02:40:20.964]  Because folks
[02:40:21.604 --> 02:40:23.844]  We're on the deck of the Titanic saying, get to the lifeboats.
[02:40:23.884 --> 02:40:41.407]  Now, I've been ranting, sir, it's just that I think it's important before we get into the economy and where it's all going, and some of your charts you're about to show here for TV viewers, radio listeners will be able to find this on YouTube tomorrow, or prisonplanet.tv tonight, but there's a free feed at infowars.com forward slash show right now.
[02:40:42.208 --> 02:40:43.988]  But briefly, and then I want to get into inflation.
[02:40:44.668 --> 02:40:49.589]  Briefly, I mean, I'm not a technical financial scientist like you,
[02:40:50.740 --> 02:40:55.068]  I just look at it with street smarts as a layman, but how would you quantify what I just said?
[02:40:55.088 --> 02:40:58.254]  Do you agree with it about the awakening, A?
[02:40:58.796 --> 02:41:00.459]  Or B, am I being too optimistic?
[02:41:00.479 --> 02:41:01.541]  I mean, what does your gut tell you?
[02:41:02.421 --> 02:41:16.527]  No, I think, I study a lot of cycles, Alex, and one of them is a 250-year revolutionary cycle, as in the Revolutionary War, 250 years ago, and the whole wealth of nations by Adam Smith and stuff.
[02:41:16.587 --> 02:41:19.108]  We're ripe for a major revolution.
[02:41:19.188 --> 02:41:24.751]  Things do go towards more freedom, even though at times they go the other way, and I think that's what's going to come out of this.
[02:41:25.251 --> 02:41:26.091]  I do think it's important.
[02:41:26.111 --> 02:41:27.331]  I've got the same mission you do.
[02:41:27.391 --> 02:41:28.572]  I'm just warning people.
[02:41:28.932 --> 02:41:30.732]  The media doesn't want people to hear this.
[02:41:30.792 --> 02:41:32.513]  Politicians don't want people to hear it.
[02:41:32.893 --> 02:41:35.073]  You know, Merrill Lynch doesn't want people to hear it.
[02:41:35.113 --> 02:41:37.133]  You know, in financial institutions and banks.
[02:41:37.494 --> 02:41:38.454]  But this is the truth.
[02:41:38.514 --> 02:41:40.854]  I just tell people, here's how much debt we have.
[02:41:40.874 --> 02:41:45.135]  We have $127 trillion by my last conservative count.
[02:41:45.575 --> 02:41:46.895]  Eight times GDP.
[02:41:47.376 --> 02:41:48.916]  Here's what our demographics say.
[02:41:48.956 --> 02:41:49.876]  It predicted the boom.
[02:41:49.936 --> 02:41:51.096]  Now it's predicting a bust.
[02:41:51.156 --> 02:41:52.917]  So I'm not a bearish person.
[02:41:52.957 --> 02:41:54.337]  I've been bullish for 20 years.
[02:41:54.817 --> 02:42:00.578]  But the trends are down, and now with these bubbles, I've also studied every bubble in history.
[02:42:00.618 --> 02:42:06.980]  I've got a whole chapter in the book, Chapter 5 on Bubbles, this unpublished chapter on China, the greatest bubble of them all.
[02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:10.161]  You've got to understand bubbles, because people get in denial.
[02:42:10.581 --> 02:42:19.443]  And so I agree with you, people who hear this sort of stuff, who hear the truth, need to tell other people, and warn them, because people are going to get their ass handed to them.
[02:42:19.463 --> 02:42:23.944]  I hate to say this, but you know, you think the last crash was bad, or the last recession,
[02:42:24.807 --> 02:42:37.672]  I think this is going to be more like the Great Depression because the longer they put this off and the more they pump up all this artificial money, which again is just like taking an artificial drug to stay high and get higher.
[02:42:37.712 --> 02:42:38.432]  It's exactly that.
[02:42:38.653 --> 02:42:40.333]  The worse the come down is going to be.
[02:42:40.393 --> 02:42:42.674]  So people do really do need to be prepared.
[02:42:43.114 --> 02:42:45.895]  They need to get in safe investments now.
[02:42:45.935 --> 02:42:48.396]  Don't don't chase this bubble any further.
[02:42:48.416 --> 02:42:49.837]  It may go up another few percent.
[02:42:50.378 --> 02:42:54.806]  It's already bubbly and I tell you if I can show the one chart I should show people.
[02:42:55.692 --> 02:42:59.014]  Is that megaphone chart I alluded to earlier.
[02:42:59.034 --> 02:43:01.115]  If you look at them, this is a very simple chart.
[02:43:01.135 --> 02:43:02.496]  Nothing complicated about it.
[02:43:03.056 --> 02:43:07.739]  Each bubble has taken us to new highs and each crash has taken us to new lows.
[02:43:07.759 --> 02:43:16.063]  This is exactly a similar pattern to how the market peaked when the last generation peaked in their spending, the Bob Hope or World War II generation.
[02:43:16.103 --> 02:43:18.065]  We had three higher peaks in 65, 68 and 72.
[02:43:20.886 --> 02:43:27.328]  And then we kept having lower lows and of course the big crash hit in 73-74 and nobody saw that coming.
[02:43:27.608 --> 02:43:29.209]  This is a very obvious pattern.
[02:43:29.629 --> 02:43:31.069]  You talk about common sense.
[02:43:31.389 --> 02:43:33.910]  Our biggest indicator is the spending wave.
[02:43:33.970 --> 02:43:40.752]  It's just a 46-year lag for the predictable, quantifiable peak in spending of the average household in this country.
[02:43:41.132 --> 02:43:45.534]  And it would have told you decades ago that we would have an unprecedented boom from 1983
[02:43:47.194 --> 02:43:57.222]  to 2007 with the rising baby boomers earning and spending more money getting their kids in college and all that good stuff and then we would have a downturn from 2008 to 2020 to 2023.
[02:43:57.463 --> 02:44:00.165]  That's a very simple indicator.
[02:44:00.265 --> 02:44:00.965]  Common sense.
[02:44:01.065 --> 02:44:03.247]  People spend more money as they raise their families.
[02:44:03.267 --> 02:44:04.448]  Who doesn't understand that?
[02:44:04.828 --> 02:44:06.169]  We can quantify it.
[02:44:06.189 --> 02:44:07.210]  We can project this.
[02:44:07.270 --> 02:44:11.654]  We know when people are born and I just for legal and illegal immigrants
[02:44:12.074 --> 02:44:12.514]  Well, you know why?
[02:44:12.534 --> 02:44:20.798]  It's because they want to specialize in different schools to then compete with each other to have more textbooks and then to confuse the whole thing so nobody can even understand it.
[02:44:20.818 --> 02:44:24.080]  That's what a lot of the big banks have been financing for a hundred years.
[02:44:36.485 --> 02:44:45.852]  Is basically conflating everything, but let me ask you this, and I want you to go to the charts and basically predict the next shoe to drop with our guest here today, Harry Dent.
[02:44:46.672 --> 02:44:47.693]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:44:47.733 --> 02:44:55.839]  Look, I agree with you that when the big depression really kicks off, we're already in an obvious long-term recession, depression in many areas of the world, depression in different sectors.
[02:44:56.639 --> 02:45:02.564]  It's a very managed economy, so some areas are boom, but the larger aggregate, just looking at it, is bust.
[02:45:03.225 --> 02:45:09.811]  And even the establishment is starting to admit that, and they're buying armored vehicles, and the Pentagon admits they're preparing for collapse, and Europe's preparing.
[02:45:10.171 --> 02:45:12.293]  So, we know what's happening.
[02:45:12.693 --> 02:45:14.114]  But just like when you were on a few months ago,
[02:45:15.191 --> 02:45:37.005]  I said, look, I get that there is going to be deflation, that's probably where this goes, but the elites have been taking trillions, bailing out their too-big-to-fails, giving it to themselves, and so you can see luxury items, Bentleys, big houses, helicopters, they're all double, triple, huge inflation, because the elite are being smart, they're keeping it all to themselves.
[02:45:37.386 --> 02:45:38.867]  The problem is it leaks out.
[02:45:38.907 --> 02:45:40.088]  There is some trickle-down.
[02:45:41.088 --> 02:45:44.232]  And so now it's causing inflation in a lot of areas.
[02:45:44.532 --> 02:45:47.957]  The QE, even though it's slowing, look at meat prices exploding.
[02:45:47.997 --> 02:45:51.381]  Look at state, everybody, I go out, everything's going up in price.
[02:45:52.041 --> 02:45:54.224]  When I was in the Caribbean, I said, why is stuff so expensive?
[02:45:54.264 --> 02:45:56.367]  They said, well, we're pegged to the dollar here.
[02:45:56.787 --> 02:45:59.330]  You know, I mean, my God, they were aware of it.
[02:46:00.071 --> 02:46:01.652]  That's how inflation works, correct me if I'm wrong.
[02:46:01.932 --> 02:46:08.495]  It's generally worse outside the country first, then those dollars start coming back in, the different M1, M2.
[02:46:08.895 --> 02:46:23.761]  So, break down for me how we're seeing inflation, but also there is a deflation in business, deflation in some of the real markets, trillions of dollars chasing the stock market, pumping it up with QE dollars.
[02:46:23.801 --> 02:46:28.503]  I mean, aren't we seeing a stock market inflation, just like we see in some commodities?
[02:46:28.764 --> 02:46:29.424]  Explain this to me.
[02:46:30.060 --> 02:46:30.720]  Yeah, that's what we're seeing.
[02:46:30.961 --> 02:46:33.382]  What you're getting, this only happens once in a lifetime.
[02:46:33.422 --> 02:46:35.464]  That's why people don't understand it and see it.
[02:46:35.864 --> 02:46:41.108]  The last bubble economy we had was from World War I into the Roaring Twenties.
[02:46:41.528 --> 02:46:44.430]  And in that time, you get debt growing way faster in the economy.
[02:46:44.450 --> 02:46:48.393]  You can't, a debt grew from 1983 to 2008 at its peak.
[02:46:48.473 --> 02:46:53.897]  Private and public debt together grew at 2.6 times our economy, our GDP.
[02:46:54.297 --> 02:46:58.460]  You can't do that for 25 years without getting a huge debt imbalance.
[02:46:58.840 --> 02:47:00.061]  So you get too much debt.
[02:47:00.441 --> 02:47:02.062]  That overstimulates the economy.
[02:47:02.082 --> 02:47:07.345]  The government then, on top of that, pours in money every time we have a recession and pushes down interest rates.
[02:47:07.725 --> 02:47:10.046]  And that causes even more borrowing and leverage.
[02:47:10.227 --> 02:47:17.170]  So you create more and more leverage, again, like a financial drug, like steroids or crack, financial enhancing drugs.
[02:47:17.791 --> 02:47:19.572]  And basically, it creates bubbles.
[02:47:19.992 --> 02:47:26.616]  Businesses... Sure, I understand, but explain to me how you're saying we're going to see, you know, depressionary stuff.
[02:47:27.711 --> 02:47:34.540]  But, I mean, economists didn't think until the 70s you could have inflation and depression, but then they had stagflation.
[02:47:34.840 --> 02:47:36.622]  Would this be hyperstaginflation?
[02:47:36.883 --> 02:47:43.491]  Or once it blows up and pops, is it so bad, then things will implode and then that will take out the inflation?
[02:47:43.531 --> 02:47:44.152]  I mean, what's happening?
[02:47:44.639 --> 02:47:49.422]  Yeah, actually Alex, in chapter one of my book I showed four seasons of our economy.
[02:47:49.962 --> 02:47:57.367]  Spring boom, a summer stagflation, high inflation, recession, which again economists never understood even when it happened.
[02:47:57.687 --> 02:48:01.109]  It's part of the model that repeats once in a lifetime all throughout history.
[02:48:01.429 --> 02:48:05.952]  Then you get a fall bubble boom and that inflation falls, you get very low interest rates.
[02:48:06.212 --> 02:48:13.216]  That's when technologies move most mainstream like microcomputers in this one and automobiles in the roaring 20s and stuff like that.
[02:48:13.956 --> 02:48:25.262]  But when you get this bubble, people over-borrow, over-expand, over-leverage, and then when the generation cycles turn down, the bubbles burst, and you get a huge debt deleveraging.
[02:48:25.302 --> 02:48:27.723]  I mean, in the health industries, they call it a detox.
[02:48:28.103 --> 02:48:30.364]  Or if somebody's coming off drugs, they call it a detox.
[02:48:30.664 --> 02:48:31.945]  It's a debt detox.
[02:48:32.586 --> 02:48:39.410]  What happened in the Great Depression is that we went from debt, being 190% of GDP, down to 60%.
[02:48:39.970 --> 02:48:41.531]  We shed a ton of debt.
[02:48:41.611 --> 02:48:43.272]  Trillions and trillions of dollars of debt.
[02:48:43.633 --> 02:48:49.536]  Most of it private debt, because government deficits only tend to go up in downturn because their revenues go down and their costs go up.
[02:48:49.556 --> 02:48:50.637]  But we shed debt.
[02:48:50.957 --> 02:48:52.278]  The economy rebalanced.
[02:48:52.318 --> 02:48:53.298]  The bubbles burst.
[02:48:53.378 --> 02:48:55.279]  Real estate went back down to reality.
[02:48:55.600 --> 02:48:56.440]  Stocks crashed 89%.
[02:48:58.201 --> 02:49:08.746]  See, all these top 1% of people that are controlling all the assets, they're the ones that are going to get hit the worst when this bubble finally bursts and doesn't get cranked back up by the government.
[02:49:08.766 --> 02:49:14.388]  The government has saved the banks and has saved the top 1% and it's screwed the everyday household.
[02:49:14.788 --> 02:49:25.113]  What should have happened is we should have written down these mortgages, which were way over lent by banks, and they're the sophisticated people, not the everyday household, way over lent against high home valuations.
[02:49:25.153 --> 02:49:29.595]  Those home valuations need to come down where a young family can afford a home again.
[02:49:29.996 --> 02:49:31.496]  Mortgages need to be written off.
[02:49:31.556 --> 02:49:38.120]  If the average person had their mortgage written down in half in line with their house, they would be a lot better off instead of worse off.
[02:49:38.940 --> 02:49:41.122]  It's this, the financial bubble's bursting.
[02:49:41.202 --> 02:49:46.546]  The Dow goes from $17,000, my ultimate target is more like $3,000 to $4,000 down the road around 2020.
[02:49:46.746 --> 02:49:51.269]  That's going to destroy, you know, 80% of people's wealth.
[02:49:51.309 --> 02:49:55.592]  You've got $80 trillion in net worth that could be cut in half.
[02:49:55.632 --> 02:49:57.334]  That's money that disappears.
[02:49:57.654 --> 02:49:58.695]  Home prices drop.
[02:49:58.955 --> 02:50:00.096]  Stock prices drop.
[02:50:00.236 --> 02:50:01.076]  All this sort of stuff.
[02:50:01.457 --> 02:50:03.658]  A lot of debt gets restructured and written off.
[02:50:03.858 --> 02:50:07.221]  That means, as I said earlier, money disappearing.
[02:50:07.601 --> 02:50:11.823]  It never comes back, or at least for a long time, and that creates deflation.
[02:50:11.843 --> 02:50:18.227]  So it's the opposite of the inflation, what I call summer season we saw in the 70s, and that's the way the economy goes.
[02:50:18.307 --> 02:50:27.632]  It goes from mild inflation in spring, to high inflation in summer, to falling inflation again, which everybody loves in fall, and then to deflation in winter.
[02:50:27.712 --> 02:50:29.773]  This happens over and over and again.
[02:50:29.833 --> 02:50:33.195]  It used to be every 50 to 60 years when our lifespans were that.
[02:50:33.455 --> 02:50:36.417]  Now our lifespans are more like 80, so this cycle is more like 80 years.
[02:50:37.037 --> 02:50:38.919]  Economists don't understand this.
[02:50:39.219 --> 02:50:49.068]  They don't understand the dynamics of the free market system, why deflation and inflation actually stimulate the strongest innovations that pay off for decades.
[02:50:49.449 --> 02:51:00.880]  They also, I mean, having home prices come back down, having a lot of debt written off, restructuring our entitlements, which we can't even remotely afford what's been promised by the government for Medicare, Medicaid.
[02:51:02.461 --> 02:51:02.921]  Exactly!
[02:51:02.961 --> 02:51:03.942]  It makes things cheaper.
[02:51:03.982 --> 02:51:04.862]  It makes things cheaper.
[02:51:04.882 --> 02:51:05.623]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:05.683 --> 02:51:06.143]  Stay with us.
[02:51:06.763 --> 02:51:08.745]  I want to ask you a few other questions on the subject.
[02:51:08.765 --> 02:51:09.905]  Hey, this is Steve Sanchez.

[02:51:12.207 --> 02:51:14.308]  Wondering when the stock market is going to collapse?
[02:51:14.448 --> 02:51:17.430]  You probably want answers, but you know you can't trust the global elite.
[02:51:17.490 --> 02:51:22.753]  Well, my good friend Brett Kitchen, best-selling author, has created a DVD set called The Millionaire Black Box.

[02:52:37.714 --> 02:52:39.255]  You are now in the crosshairs.
[02:52:39.415 --> 02:52:44.177]  The NSA and the FBI are treating you like a criminal and monitoring your every move.
[02:52:44.597 --> 02:52:51.360]  Ron Paul said recently, the evidence of the totalitarian nature of this government is on display undeniably every day.
[02:52:51.640 --> 02:52:55.742]  What's taking place right now is a coup and the destruction of the Constitution.
[02:52:56.102 --> 02:52:58.623]  But a friend and patriot has discovered a loophole.
[02:52:58.903 --> 02:53:04.166]  Find out about the NSA loophole before they shut it down at privacylockdown.com.

[02:53:07.307 --> 02:53:07.707]  Question.
[02:53:08.067 --> 02:53:12.310]  Could too many GMO foods and toxins be overloading your digestive and immune systems?
[02:53:12.870 --> 02:53:13.711]  Answer, yes.
[02:53:14.111 --> 02:53:19.894]  If you're searching for a powerful detox that's gentle enough to use every day, use Pro-EM-1 from Kerriganix.

[02:53:57.274 --> 02:53:58.254]  Life's getting better.
[02:54:17.538 --> 02:54:27.020]  I tend to get a little frantic on air with guests like Mr. Dent because we're not really talking about something that's rocket science here.
[02:54:27.660 --> 02:54:28.381]  It's historical.
[02:54:28.441 --> 02:54:36.443]  Now, he takes it and shows it in a scientific way so people can see the facts for themselves, but this is all common sense.
[02:54:37.283 --> 02:54:38.723]  And I've studied the establishment.
[02:54:39.123 --> 02:54:46.785]  They have created models where they think they're going to get more power out of this incremental collapse and domesticate us, break our will.
[02:54:49.073 --> 02:54:50.574]  They're smoking their own dope.
[02:54:50.794 --> 02:54:53.135]  They can't manage their way out of a wet paper bag.
[02:54:53.635 --> 02:54:55.756]  And Obama vacations four months a year.
[02:54:57.757 --> 02:54:59.178]  So this is not going to go well.
[02:54:59.518 --> 02:55:00.619]  I don't know what's going to happen.
[02:55:02.539 --> 02:55:06.221]  But it runs from bad to worse with a lot of crazy mixed in.
[02:55:06.942 --> 02:55:09.723]  And I don't want to see this like some Planet of the Apes scenario.
[02:55:10.816 --> 02:55:15.838]  I mean, I've seen some of these governmental and corporate interests that have just wrecked other countries that were great nations.
[02:55:17.279 --> 02:55:19.500]  It happened to Chile and others.
[02:55:19.600 --> 02:55:25.543]  And I just am so sad to see them trying to turn this country into a third world nation.
[02:55:27.384 --> 02:55:33.887]  And I guess I'm involved in collective hand-wringing, just saying, how do we wake people up?
[02:55:33.927 --> 02:55:36.548]  And I think it's with the fundamentals, it's the basics.
[02:55:39.105 --> 02:55:51.434]  What do you expect the political class in Europe, the United States, and other places to do when one of these crises goes over the edge like Ukraine, ISIS in the Middle East, China blowing up all the time?
[02:55:51.454 --> 02:55:52.835]  People say, where's the meltdown?
[02:55:52.875 --> 02:55:53.555]  Where's the blow-up?
[02:55:54.035 --> 02:56:00.620]  Look at the societal rot, the cities, the dozens of states about to go bankrupt, hundreds of cities already bankrupt.
[02:56:01.020 --> 02:56:03.382]  All the numbers, it's just so astronomical.
[02:56:03.642 --> 02:56:04.683]  I mean, it's guaranteed.
[02:56:04.703 --> 02:56:06.204]  It's like a guy that's had five heart attacks.
[02:56:07.082 --> 02:56:12.666]  And he's 85 years old, and they're saying he's got to walk up the Empire State Building stairway.
[02:56:12.686 --> 02:56:17.590]  I mean, we don't know if he's going to have a heart attack this time, but he's going to have one soon is what I'm saying.
[02:56:18.491 --> 02:56:22.354]  I just feel like I'm sitting on top of a bunch of lit TNT, Harry.
[02:56:23.595 --> 02:56:28.596]  Well, as you know, in addition to our demographic cycles, I have an innovation cycle every 45 years.
[02:56:28.616 --> 02:56:29.337]  It's very simple.
[02:56:29.657 --> 02:56:34.638]  A geopolitical cycle that turns negative every 36 years.
[02:56:35.198 --> 02:56:42.800]  From 9-11 into the end of this decade, this cycle continues to point down and everything has gone wrong since then.
[02:56:43.220 --> 02:56:49.302]  The Middle East is an outright Shia-Sunni civil war that's going to blow up now that we're not willing to intervene anymore.
[02:56:49.882 --> 02:56:52.183]  I don't think we should have been the first place in that case.
[02:56:52.503 --> 02:56:57.184]  China's going to have unbelievable social unrest when this bubble bursts.
[02:56:57.485 --> 02:57:08.468]  They've got 221 million unregistered rural citizens living in cities that aren't even legal people there, and they don't have any skills.
[02:57:08.488 --> 02:57:13.250]  They're tolerated like illegal immigrants here in the United States, and then boom, they will not be tolerated in the bus.
[02:57:13.270 --> 02:57:14.350]  They're going to have huge
[02:57:14.910 --> 02:57:23.295]  So things are going to get worse, and we've got strong polarization in this country, and you know, when this bubble bursts, it's going to be bad next time.
[02:57:23.335 --> 02:57:28.158]  And I think what I see happening is everybody's been telling people it's okay.
[02:57:28.178 --> 02:57:34.902]  You know, the leaders in Europe, the leaders in the US, the Chinese, oh, we can manage this, we can have a soft landing, we can engineer our economy.
[02:57:35.282 --> 02:57:40.145]  These people are going to lose credibility because they told us it was going to be okay.
[02:57:40.845 --> 02:57:41.105]  I don't
[02:57:56.844 --> 02:58:00.945]  You know, I'm popular with a certain group of people and in certain arenas like this.
[02:58:01.225 --> 02:58:03.986]  CNBC has me on just as a contrary person.
[02:58:04.026 --> 02:58:05.066]  They don't agree with me.
[02:58:05.426 --> 02:58:07.507]  They don't want to hear what I have to say.
[02:58:07.787 --> 02:58:13.048]  But people are going to remember people like you or I or other people said, hey, there's a problem here.
[02:58:13.248 --> 02:58:14.489]  Hey, there's a crisis coming.
[02:58:14.689 --> 02:58:20.050]  So people are going to naturally listen to those people and not to the people that told them everything's OK.
[02:58:20.090 --> 02:58:20.810]  We can manage.
[02:58:20.830 --> 02:58:21.050]  Sure.
[02:58:21.610 --> 02:58:23.251]  Harry, Dan, I don't want to
[02:58:25.882 --> 02:58:26.703]  We'll bug you too much.
[02:58:26.743 --> 02:58:31.250]  I know you're a busy guy, but I'd like to get you back soon to specifically give people tips.
[02:58:31.290 --> 02:58:39.382]  I know you can't give them individually tips, but maybe take an hour of calls and talk about what people individually could do if you were them.
[02:58:39.402 --> 02:58:41.425]  So hopefully you'll come back on the next few weeks.
[02:58:42.526 --> 02:58:45.829]  Yeah, I've got to go to Australia, but I'll be back like early August.
[02:58:45.869 --> 02:58:46.470]  Let's do it.
[02:58:46.510 --> 02:58:48.672]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[02:58:48.832 --> 02:58:49.553]  You want to finish?
[02:58:49.573 --> 02:58:50.473]  We're back in one minute.
[02:58:50.493 --> 02:58:51.815]  If you do five more minutes, we'll let you finish.
[02:58:52.295 --> 02:58:55.038]  Alright, harrydent.com, Alex Jones.
[02:58:55.058 --> 02:58:57.100]  You can find the new chapter, the ghost chapter.
[02:58:58.686 --> 02:59:03.428]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[02:59:03.648 --> 02:59:06.770]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[02:59:07.010 --> 02:59:08.851]  She's just not the woman I married.
[02:59:09.111 --> 02:59:11.032]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[02:59:11.272 --> 02:59:12.753]  Does this seem familiar?
[02:59:12.913 --> 02:59:15.955]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[02:59:16.235 --> 02:59:17.575]  If so, consider this.
[02:59:17.815 --> 02:59:26.740]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[02:59:27.100 --> 02:59:33.128]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.
[02:59:33.488 --> 02:59:35.130]  Forget synthetic chemicals.
[02:59:35.531 --> 02:59:43.201]  Super Female Vitality brings forward key herbs specifically chosen for women's biology without the use of phony additives.

[02:59:56.748 --> 02:59:57.829]  Live Life Healthy.
[02:59:59.510 --> 03:00:00.670]  Coast to Coast.
[03:00:01.050 --> 03:00:02.451]  Direct from Austin.
[03:00:03.092 --> 03:00:06.293]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:14.625 --> 03:00:18.787]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:19.447 --> 03:00:20.248]  You want answers?
[03:00:21.028 --> 03:00:22.008]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:22.288 --> 03:00:26.190]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:26.770 --> 03:00:30.852]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:33.353 --> 03:00:35.474]  By the way, I'll do the full three hours tomorrow.
[03:00:35.694 --> 03:00:37.155]  I'm going to be on the nightly news tonight.
[03:00:37.935 --> 03:00:38.776]  A lot coming up.
[03:00:38.976 --> 03:00:40.957]  Alex Jones here, back in town.
[03:00:43.570 --> 03:00:49.395]  Harrydent.com forward slash Alex Jones to find the unpublished chapter of his book because it didn't come out in time to get in the bestseller.
[03:00:50.255 --> 03:00:51.436]  The Demographic Cliff.
[03:00:52.777 --> 03:00:53.958]  Excellent reading, by the way.
[03:00:54.819 --> 03:01:00.524]  It's unfortunate, but denying these things is only going to make it worse, so we're here just admitting how serious things have gotten.
[03:01:01.901 --> 03:01:11.408]  But continuing with our guest, in the four or five minutes we have left in this segment, he was getting cut off, talking about he'd come on once he gets back from Australia.
[03:01:11.868 --> 03:01:13.809]  That's an interesting point you raise about Australia.
[03:01:14.835 --> 03:01:16.936]  Doing things better on several fronts.
[03:01:16.976 --> 03:01:19.238]  They're now moving to vote down carbon taxes.
[03:01:20.098 --> 03:01:23.260]  I'm seeing moves to try to repeal some of their anti-gun laws there.
[03:01:23.941 --> 03:01:24.601]  You've been there.
[03:01:24.621 --> 03:01:25.622]  I haven't been to Australia.
[03:01:25.642 --> 03:01:26.542]  You've been there recently.
[03:01:26.562 --> 03:01:34.587]  You used to go and assess companies, assess countries for major financial institutions out there like Bain.
[03:01:36.208 --> 03:01:41.071]  What would you say about a country like Australia versus China versus the United States?
[03:01:41.872 --> 03:01:47.214]  Well, unfortunately, Australia's biggest customer for their exports is China, so they're going to feel that very hard.
[03:01:47.635 --> 03:01:50.796]  And they do have a big real estate bubble that they're in denial about.
[03:01:50.816 --> 03:01:54.478]  But Australia's government has almost no debt, like you said.
[03:01:54.858 --> 03:02:06.803]  They have such potent immigration policies, and they're attracting highly qualified Asian citizens that may, on average, be more educated and more affluent than the average person in Australia.
[03:02:07.124 --> 03:02:10.265]  They're one of the few countries in the world, the Western rich countries, that actually
[03:02:10.445 --> 03:02:10.765]  I think so.
[03:02:35.331 --> 03:02:45.498]  Australia will probably survive this crisis better than any other wealthy country, or among the best, and it will do much better in the next boom, especially being on the Pacific Rim.
[03:02:45.558 --> 03:02:47.839]  So I tell you, man, I thought of moving to Australia.
[03:02:47.959 --> 03:02:49.020]  I love the country.
[03:02:49.500 --> 03:02:58.846]  I sell five times as many books per capita, given the smaller population, there than I do in the U.S., and they're great people, and I think they're really lucky.
[03:02:58.866 --> 03:03:03.349]  They have a lot of resources, and they've got better common sense
[03:03:03.929 --> 03:03:07.353]  But you almost sound like you're saying it's the new Singapore.
[03:03:07.373 --> 03:03:09.134]  You're saying Australia is the new Singapore?
[03:03:30.057 --> 03:03:44.153]  I wouldn't go with that because it's not as much a financial center, but they are a wealthy country and a major exporter to the whole Pacific Rim Asian region, which is going to be the biggest growth energy in the future.
[03:03:44.573 --> 03:03:48.357]  I mean, most developed countries are not going to grow as fast, including the U.S.
[03:03:48.418 --> 03:03:50.380]  We've got much better demographics than Europe.
[03:03:50.980 --> 03:03:59.323]  But we should be attracting high-skilled people because we have aborted our next generation so we need to import people.
[03:03:59.663 --> 03:04:00.103]  I get that.
[03:04:00.143 --> 03:04:02.904]  We just don't need welfare moms that'll vote Democratic.
[03:04:03.584 --> 03:04:04.825]  I mean literally with five kids.
[03:04:04.845 --> 03:04:06.505]  I mean this is this is national suicide.
[03:04:06.545 --> 03:04:14.848]  We have our quotas on the high-skilled people that we come over here and attract to educate in the best universities in the world and then we let people run across the border.
[03:04:15.008 --> 03:04:16.869]  So it's not a good immigration policy.
[03:04:17.509 --> 03:04:18.890]  It's a way to destroy a country.
[03:04:19.570 --> 03:04:21.252]  Harry Dent, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[03:04:21.912 --> 03:04:22.773]  Sure, enjoyed it.
[03:04:22.953 --> 03:04:23.753]  Look forward to talking to him later.
[03:04:24.454 --> 03:04:25.674]  And again, Harry's a really great guy.
[03:04:25.694 --> 03:04:28.997]  I agree with him on the economics, but you can see what a nice guy he is from the perspective.
[03:04:29.017 --> 03:04:30.898]  He's like, oh, they got cameras, they don't let you speed.
[03:04:33.479 --> 03:04:41.024]  But again, it's that attitude of like, well, the system, you know, is out of control, it's corrupt, it's dumb, but, you know, oh, the cameras, you know, they're going to make people be law-abiding.
[03:04:41.625 --> 03:04:43.486]  And see, that's so much the problem is that
[03:04:45.350 --> 03:04:50.215]  is that you can always have a good argument for what the system's doing until you see it from another angle.
[03:04:50.235 --> 03:04:51.456]  Well, that was my point on the cameras.
[03:04:52.617 --> 03:04:55.680]  But all will tell in time.
[03:04:55.700 --> 03:04:59.223]  I'm glad I was able to get into the broadcast today.
[03:04:59.243 --> 03:05:00.104]  Great job to the crew.
[03:05:00.244 --> 03:05:01.145]  I'll take a lot of calls.
[03:05:01.505 --> 03:05:02.946]  Got some big guests tomorrow.
[03:05:02.966 --> 03:05:04.848]  11 a.m.
[03:05:04.888 --> 03:05:06.750]  Central, Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock.
[03:05:10.467 --> 03:05:11.528]  In the near future.
[03:05:11.788 --> 03:05:15.970]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[03:05:16.290 --> 03:05:17.311]  Security alert.
[03:05:17.531 --> 03:05:19.272]  This is Homeland Security.
[03:05:19.532 --> 03:05:20.172]  Analysis.
[03:05:20.412 --> 03:05:23.094]  InfoWars building independent media operations.
[03:05:23.114 --> 03:05:28.097]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[03:05:28.117 --> 03:05:29.077]  Crime Directive.
[03:05:29.137 --> 03:05:30.638]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[03:05:30.698 --> 03:05:33.480]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[03:05:33.540 --> 03:05:36.641]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[03:05:36.801 --> 03:05:39.023]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[03:05:39.083 --> 03:05:39.823]  These people are a
[03:05:40.023 --> 03:05:42.004]  They're never going to stop.
[03:05:42.204 --> 03:05:49.006]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[03:05:49.066 --> 03:05:55.709]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[03:05:56.369 --> 03:06:02.251]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[03:06:08.843 --> 03:06:10.204]  It's time for some Life Talk.
[03:06:10.805 --> 03:06:16.910]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[03:06:16.930 --> 03:06:20.233]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[03:06:20.253 --> 03:06:21.975]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted.
[03:06:21.995 --> 03:06:28.301]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[03:06:28.401 --> 03:06:34.266]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless and security sticking their hands down on the streets?
[03:06:34.426 --> 03:06:38.188]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[03:06:38.388 --> 03:06:41.290]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[03:06:41.330 --> 03:06:49.475]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[03:06:49.735 --> 03:06:51.796]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[03:06:51.836 --> 03:06:52.877]  It's a war against the truth.
[03:06:53.237 --> 03:07:02.000]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[03:07:02.200 --> 03:07:04.621]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.

[03:07:11.288 --> 03:07:13.069]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[03:07:13.590 --> 03:07:20.554]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[03:07:21.014 --> 03:07:31.461]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[03:07:31.862 --> 03:07:41.088]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[03:07:41.808 --> 03:07:45.249]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[03:07:45.870 --> 03:07:49.291]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[03:07:49.651 --> 03:07:51.191]  Experience the new formula.
[03:07:51.691 --> 03:07:53.672]  Experience the ancient purity.
[03:07:54.272 --> 03:07:55.233]  Shield your family.
[03:07:55.593 --> 03:07:56.973]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:07:57.413 --> 03:07:59.994]  Available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:08:00.574 --> 03:08:04.556]  X2 from InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[03:08:23.687 --> 03:08:26.309]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:08:26.329 --> 03:08:32.014]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:08:32.654 --> 03:08:39.539]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Wednesday, July 2nd, 2014.
[03:08:40.900 --> 03:08:41.601]  I'm David Knight.
[03:08:42.282 --> 03:08:46.125]  Alex Jones is going to be joining us live in the studio later in the show.
[03:08:46.545 --> 03:08:51.609]  We're also going to have Harry Dent, the economist, talking to us about what he sees as the challenges ahead
[03:08:52.129 --> 03:08:59.414]  Of course, yesterday we had Peter Van Buren giving us a fictional look at the current situation in America's decline since the 1950s.
[03:08:59.694 --> 03:09:02.196]  Kind of a retelling of the Grapes of Wrath.
[03:09:02.616 --> 03:09:04.938]  Calls it the Ghost of Tom Jode.
[03:09:05.278 --> 03:09:05.818]  The story of the 99%.
[03:09:06.799 --> 03:09:10.241]  He looks at the decline since the 1950s.
[03:09:10.281 --> 03:09:18.627]  And of course, as we heard Hemingway say in his book, The Sun Also Rises, one of the characters is asked how he went bankrupt.
[03:09:18.647 --> 03:09:21.449]  He said, well, gradually at first, and then suddenly.
[03:09:22.109 --> 03:09:24.551]  And that's the way we believe this is going to roll out.
[03:09:24.631 --> 03:09:26.292]  Things are certainly accelerating.
[03:09:26.332 --> 03:09:43.986]  We have the collapse of the border as part of the Cloward and Piven strategy, strategized back in the 1960s to collapse the United States with a welfare state, an entitlement state, to rapidly increase that to the point that it could no longer be sustained so they could rebuild on the ruins of America.
[03:09:44.586 --> 03:09:45.126]  No, we're good.
