[00:00:01.249 --> 00:00:03.730]  How much indication do you have about premeditation here?
[00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.831]  Was there anything tied to the timing of it?
[00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:08.132]  Was there something going on at this building?
[00:00:08.172 --> 00:00:08.812]  I do not know.
[00:00:08.832 --> 00:00:10.413]  That'll be part of the investigation.
[00:00:10.573 --> 00:00:15.475]  I did not say his rank nor his name and I'll do that when his family is appropriately notified.
[00:00:16.475 --> 00:00:18.636]  Sir, you said he came from another installation in February.
[00:00:18.656 --> 00:00:19.036]  Can you tell us
[00:00:20.527 --> 00:00:22.168]  At this time, I prefer not.
[00:00:22.408 --> 00:00:28.549]  He was undergoing behavioral health and psychiatric treatment for depression and anxiety.
[00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:38.832]  There are reports, I don't know if he was diagnosed in a clinical sense, there are reports that he self-reported a traumatic brain injury previously coming back from the Iraq.
[00:00:39.232 --> 00:00:40.912]  Was he on any sort of medications?
[00:00:41.293 --> 00:00:42.893]  He was on medications, that's correct.
[00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:46.054]  Like SSRIs or antidepressants, anything of that nature?
[00:00:46.514 --> 00:00:46.694]  Yes.
[00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:55.027]  Was the FBI already on the scene due to the alert that they gave out on Monday regarding a possible mass shooting?
[00:00:55.667 --> 00:01:02.793]  We have a local FBI liaison officer, but no, large FBI assets were not here.
[00:01:04.434 --> 00:01:06.576]  They are actually inbound to help with the investigation.
[00:01:07.316 --> 00:01:08.697]  All of the wounded and killed were military.
[00:01:08.717 --> 00:01:13.962]  General, the female officer who engaged him, how would you describe what she did today?
[00:01:14.722 --> 00:01:24.411]  So it's clearly heroic what she did at that moment in time and she did her job and she did exactly what we would expect of a United States Army military force.
[00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:29.015]  What are your thoughts on how the military can feel about that?
[00:01:29.035 --> 00:01:30.416]  You're not allowed to carry concealed weapons.
[00:01:30.436 --> 00:01:31.397]  Do you think that should change?
[00:01:34.134 --> 00:01:34.755]  No, I don't think so.
[00:01:34.775 --> 00:01:36.396]  We should have concealed weapons on both sides.
[00:01:36.997 --> 00:01:39.099]  We have law enforcement agents.
[00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.401]  We're trained professionals and I don't endorse carrying concealed weapons.
[00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:44.824]  How long did it take for the law enforcement to reach the scene?
[00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:46.706]  It was within minutes.
[00:01:46.826 --> 00:01:47.386]  Within minutes?
[00:01:47.426 --> 00:01:48.888]  Exact time, probably.
[00:01:49.928 --> 00:01:50.669]  10 to 15 maybe?
[00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:56.972]  So you're saying that we should have concealed weapons but it still takes 10 to 15 minutes for law enforcement to even reach the scene?
[00:01:57.553 --> 00:01:58.493]  What's your comments on that?
[00:01:58.513 --> 00:02:04.417]  I think the law enforcement acted very rapidly and swiftly given the nature of this circumstance.
[00:02:04.537 --> 00:02:06.838]  I understand that but there's still people that have died.
[00:02:06.858 --> 00:02:11.341]  I'm not going to have another debate with you on carrying weapons on a military installation.
[00:02:11.361 --> 00:02:16.144]  I just ask for all your thoughts and prayers for the fallen and for the wounded in this particular case.
[00:02:16.224 --> 00:02:17.985]  Thank you very much.
[00:02:24.306 --> 00:02:25.026]  Excuse me, General.
[00:02:25.446 --> 00:02:33.368]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential foreign military situation?
[00:02:34.168 --> 00:02:38.969]  Yeah, there's no link that we know of to that particular case, that we know of.
[00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:40.989]  We're investigating everything, but there's no particular link.
[00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.570]  I am aware of that FBI report and there's no particular link to that, that we know of.
[00:02:52.335 --> 00:03:00.197]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:03:00.457 --> 00:03:02.517]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:03:02.677 --> 00:03:05.338]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:03:05.378 --> 00:03:09.479]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.959]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:20.241]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:03:20.401 --> 00:03:31.466]  The brainwashing media machine has been turned up on high and it's time for humanity to double down on the true people's media and strike back against the tyrants that are destroying our civilization with their lies and fraud.
[00:03:31.686 --> 00:03:33.067]  We are the resistance.
[00:03:33.347 --> 00:03:34.687]  You are the resistance.
[00:03:35.067 --> 00:03:36.628]  You are the info war.
[00:03:36.788 --> 00:03:40.910]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.751]  We are the true media.
[00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:45.492]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:49.256]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
