[00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.430]  To our soils, to the atmosphere itself.
[00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.131]  Our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:00:06.231 --> 00:00:08.372]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:00:08.572 --> 00:00:13.674]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:00:13.854 --> 00:00:18.796]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:00:19.016 --> 00:00:22.058]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:00:22.338 --> 00:00:26.200]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.642]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:40.747]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:00:40.968 --> 00:00:43.489]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:45.571]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.812]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:01:20.472 --> 00:01:21.273]  You want answers?
[00:01:22.054 --> 00:01:22.934]  Well, so does he.
[00:01:23.595 --> 00:01:27.217]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:01:27.798 --> 00:01:31.901]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:01:36.344 --> 00:01:37.845]  The Nazi Blitzkrieg.
[00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:40.587]  Above.
[00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:52.391]  France, and then of course England, killed hundreds of thousands of people, raining bombs down on major cities, particularly the Blitz.
[00:01:53.851 --> 00:02:11.895]  And you did not see one one-thousandth of the panic that we saw in the West yesterday and today, when a reported Islamist convert with connections, at least as a fellow traveler and admirer of ISIS, that means Al-Qaeda's new comic book name,
[00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:41.654]  attacked the parliament shooting one of the uh... honor guard ceremonial honor guard that was there at the war memorial and then himself being shot by the sergeant at arms of course it was someone with a gun that was able to stop the bad guy with a gun good guys with guns stopping bad guys with guns two plus two equals four but to see the panic for hours after the parliament piling chairs up on doors
[00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:57.803]  And just men with their submachine guns shaking in fear, like they had just battled a Tyrannosaurus Rex, shows the mind control and the fear that they've instilled, not just in the general public, but government itself.
[00:02:59.803 --> 00:03:04.464]  This does not radiate confidence worldwide for the West, I will assure you.
[00:03:07.205 --> 00:03:08.045]  It's over the top.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.283]  And again, it's very sad for the gentleman that was shot and killed.
[00:03:16.144 --> 00:03:21.688]  But we had to hear how there was a second gunman for hours as they locked down much of the city of Ottawa.
[00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:32.414]  It's just another signpost on the road to insanity.
[00:03:32.474 --> 00:03:38.258]  Corporal Nathan Cirillo of Hamilton identified a soldier gunned down in Ottawa attack.
[00:03:39.728 --> 00:03:53.112]  This coward reportedly just walked right up to him and shot him multiple times in the chest, and then went and mindlessly sprayed some bullets into the parliament, and then was shot and killed before he could kill more people.
[00:03:54.513 --> 00:04:00.374]  And it's because of these radical Islamicists being funded by the West that I have predicted we'll start mass shootings.
[00:04:00.734 --> 00:04:01.675]  Not hard to predict that.
[00:04:01.695 --> 00:04:05.556]  It's like predicting tornadoes will come sometimes in the spring.
[00:04:08.965 --> 00:04:13.087]  Or that you'll get hurricanes in the fall in the Atlantic Ocean.
[00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:17.009]  Or you'll get typhoons in the Pacific.
[00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:29.454]  If you go out and you fund and you rock star these groups, and you give them all this attention, you let them operate on Twitter and Facebook, while InfoWars is censored, you're going to have this go on.
[00:04:29.695 --> 00:04:32.376]  And they don't care if people cross the border and come and do this.
[00:04:34.381 --> 00:04:38.465]  I predicted they're going to shoot down airplanes in Europe, Canada, or the US, or all three.
[00:04:39.326 --> 00:04:44.431]  We've talked about the 15,000 missing heat-seeking missiles that our government basically gave to Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:45.612]  They changed the name to ISIS.
[00:04:45.672 --> 00:04:46.212]  It's a big deal!
[00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:59.105]  Now, I'm going to cover that, but I'm just going to stop right here, and I'm going to tell everybody something that we're working on right now that is so big
[00:05:03.908 --> 00:05:12.517]  That I don't even feel worthy as a news organization, myself individually, I don't feel like, it's just bizarre, like why me?
[00:05:12.617 --> 00:05:14.419]  Why do we always get the information?
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.522]  Why are we given such dangerous information?
[00:05:18.423 --> 00:05:20.746]  Why don't other people get what's going on?
[00:05:22.548 --> 00:05:24.370]  And when I say I don't feel up to it,
[00:05:30.293 --> 00:05:33.975]  I don't know how to announce the information I have on air.
[00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:50.484]  I'm going to try to think about it during the break and I have a tendency when I've got things this horrible, but this is important to report, to not cover it.
[00:05:52.405 --> 00:05:59.029]  You notice I just went into the shooting up in Ottawa because psychologically, even though it's a tragedy, it's more comforting to me because it's something I know.
[00:06:01.578 --> 00:06:02.360]  I mean, it's terrible.
[00:06:02.581 --> 00:06:06.331]  It's the opposite of comforting, but compared to the news I have, it is comforting.
[00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:07.935]  We're gonna try to cover it when we come back.
[00:06:09.691 --> 00:06:19.877]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[00:06:20.258 --> 00:06:26.341]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:06:26.721 --> 00:06:28.943]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:06:29.043 --> 00:06:32.105]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[00:06:32.145 --> 00:06:39.029]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:06:39.525 --> 00:06:43.028]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:06:43.188 --> 00:06:47.151]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:06:47.472 --> 00:06:48.913]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:06:49.233 --> 00:06:56.840]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.961]  But for how long?
[00:06:58.241 --> 00:07:04.506]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:07:04.886 --> 00:07:07.709]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:07:09.557 --> 00:07:10.778]  Another major health threat.
[00:07:10.818 --> 00:07:15.720]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.441]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:07:18.481 --> 00:07:25.243]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:07:25.524 --> 00:07:28.385]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:07:28.525 --> 00:07:31.446]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:07:31.466 --> 00:07:33.447]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:07:33.487 --> 00:07:36.308]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:07:36.408 --> 00:07:41.911]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:07:42.131 --> 00:07:45.613]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:07:45.633 --> 00:07:48.634]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:07:48.734 --> 00:07:55.818]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[00:08:09.304 --> 00:08:10.305]  The experts are clear.
[00:08:10.625 --> 00:08:17.587]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:08:17.727 --> 00:08:23.990]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:27.591]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[00:08:27.731 --> 00:08:31.632]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:08:31.952 --> 00:08:36.993]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:08:37.274 --> 00:08:38.174]  Not our iodine.
[00:08:38.274 --> 00:08:41.855]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[00:08:42.095 --> 00:08:44.435]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[00:09:18.872 --> 00:09:22.333]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:09:22.933 --> 00:09:24.733]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:09:33.295 --> 00:09:36.276]  We're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:09:36.456 --> 00:09:36.916]  to 2 p.m.
[00:09:36.936 --> 00:09:37.356]  Central.
[00:09:39.457 --> 00:09:40.997]  And we just go where the truth takes us.
[00:09:44.994 --> 00:10:09.171]  Coming up at the bottom of the shower we're going to have a medical doctor on who wants to use his name and who he's given us his credentials who says that there are cases of Ebola in major hospitals and that they're told to basically cover it up and say that it was malaria out of Africa
[00:10:11.633 --> 00:10:16.854]  And that the feds come and swoop the bodies or the patients away.
[00:10:18.094 --> 00:10:35.297]  Now remember, the head of the Border Patrol Union said two months ago and last week on this show, we're gonna get him back on by the way if we can today or tomorrow, that indeed the CDC is on the border and is picking up people that have Ebola-like symptoms.
[00:10:37.578 --> 00:10:39.618]  Now the reason this is of such concern
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:51.267]  is that for a week we've been in contact with a doctor who is the head of a major Texas hospital.
[00:10:53.449 --> 00:10:55.710]  This is a doctor I've known personally for about a year.
[00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:59.793]  A doctor I've had dinner with multiple times.
[00:11:01.114 --> 00:11:04.176]  A doctor I've gone out with friends to the Broken Spoke.
[00:11:05.937 --> 00:11:08.739]  It's not a medical doctor that runs a hospital in Austin.
[00:11:08.779 --> 00:11:09.660]  It's another major
[00:11:10.936 --> 00:11:15.018]  Texas City, and he doesn't even want the city named, but you can probably guess.
[00:11:16.618 --> 00:11:24.882]  He told us a week ago, confirmed exactly what this other doctor, who's coming on record, is going to tell you.
[00:11:26.243 --> 00:11:36.267]  Now, since we began to learn about this, we began reaching out to other medical doctors and hospitals, and they get very upset and say, I'm not supposed to talk to you about this, but yes, this is going on.
[00:11:38.246 --> 00:11:42.286]  Ladies and gentlemen, Ebola is probably spreading inside the United States right now.
[00:11:44.076 --> 00:11:47.898]  My gut level look at this, why are they saying the family doesn't have it?
[00:11:48.218 --> 00:11:49.339]  Why did none of the neighbors get it?
[00:11:49.359 --> 00:11:51.780]  None of the kids that are around his kids, but two nurses.
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.320]  The nurses have unions.
[00:11:53.981 --> 00:11:55.962]  The nurses are going to speak up for themselves.
[00:11:56.782 --> 00:11:58.423]  The nurses have already been protesting.
[00:11:59.183 --> 00:12:08.788]  The cleanup crews on the airplanes three weeks ago in New York and other areas began going on strike, saying I'm not going to clean up vomit on these African flights.
[00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:11.551]  They're coming in out of countries with Ebola.
[00:12:11.891 --> 00:12:14.252]  We know they're covering up the numbers of Ebola deaths in Africa.
[00:12:14.472 --> 00:12:16.153]  That's even in Associated Press.
[00:12:17.354 --> 00:12:20.895]  They're set to have over a million people get Ebola.
[00:12:21.195 --> 00:12:23.136]  The only place they can run is to the U.S.
[00:12:23.196 --> 00:12:25.537]  Everybody else shut the flights down months ago.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.401]  It's a no-brainer that they're covering up Ebola.
[00:12:33.721 --> 00:12:37.043]  Now, it's a no-brainer and I've said in my gut I believe that's going on.
[00:12:38.695 --> 00:12:42.036]  Because my intellectual research shows that they're covering it up.
[00:12:42.456 --> 00:12:44.677]  All the evidence points there, they're trying to spread it.
[00:12:45.077 --> 00:12:54.021]  But also my gut, and everybody else's gut, that I talk to, is on fire right now.
[00:12:57.062 --> 00:13:04.365]  And then I talk to a major doctor, who quite frankly runs more than one hospital.
[00:13:04.405 --> 00:13:05.265]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:13:05.325 --> 00:13:06.166]  I mean a major
[00:13:07.575 --> 00:13:10.417]  Medical center, medical doctor, director.
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:18.322]  And he says, I will lose my license, they will come after me, we've been told, do not talk about it.
[00:13:18.362 --> 00:13:19.122]  But yes, it's true.
[00:13:19.483 --> 00:13:21.864]  And don't you say who I am.
[00:13:22.284 --> 00:13:23.705]  So we sit on this for a week.
[00:13:26.127 --> 00:13:29.309]  Anthony Gucciardi comes on yesterday, and I don't know what my problem is.
[00:13:29.349 --> 00:13:31.010]  That's why I say, why me?
[00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.892]  I don't even feel like I'm up to be able to cover things this big, quite frankly.
[00:13:35.427 --> 00:13:44.229]  And he mentions, we know medical doctors that say it's spreading, so a medical doctor calls in, we get his number, get his info, call, check, on the hospital site, it's him.
[00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:48.230]  And he says, yeah, they're threatening people, he's coming on in 15 minutes.
[00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:50.731]  He goes, I don't care, this is too important.
[00:13:51.311 --> 00:13:52.692]  Hippocratic oath, do no harm.
[00:13:55.572 --> 00:13:56.593]  This is sensational.
[00:13:57.913 --> 00:13:59.654]  This is the stuff talk radio's made of.
[00:14:00.514 --> 00:14:01.214]  And I hate it.
[00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.101]  I absolutely hate breaking this to you.
[00:14:06.121 --> 00:14:09.603]  This government is so evil.
[00:14:09.723 --> 00:14:11.144]  I mean, I have three children.
[00:14:11.164 --> 00:14:14.285]  I have a family I love.
[00:14:15.546 --> 00:14:26.271]  And to know that this is probably confirming what we can already see the evidence of, 95% chance Ebola's spreading and they're covering it up.
[00:14:29.812 --> 00:14:30.593]  I just can't believe it.
[00:14:32.094 --> 00:14:32.954]  What an evil government.
[00:14:34.787 --> 00:14:39.333]  Because here's the deal, they're not just covering it up to stop panic, they're covering up things that would have stopped it spreading.
[00:14:39.373 --> 00:14:40.734]  They want this on purpose.
[00:14:42.016 --> 00:14:50.707]  And I'm just coming myself face to face with the fact that I've been right, we are in this much trouble, this just validates everything, and I'm not happy to be validated.
[00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:53.611]  To be vindicated.
[00:14:54.994 --> 00:14:59.297]  Because every instinct I've got is you've done your job, you've fought hard enough, buddy.
[00:14:59.758 --> 00:15:01.619]  You've spent 20 years battling this.
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.621]  You are a major target.
[00:15:04.441 --> 00:15:07.644]  Get out of here or shut up and shut it down.
[00:15:13.288 --> 00:15:15.250]  Because most other people are cowards.
[00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.451]  There aren't a lot of other outlets that'll cover things like this.
[00:15:18.672 --> 00:15:20.454]  And so you better believe I'm a major target.
[00:15:21.527 --> 00:15:27.652]  But I'm not going to shut it down and I'm not going to shut up because sure, I could run from this for a while.
[00:15:28.252 --> 00:15:35.238]  We all collectively got in this position by running from tyranny and by trying to appease it and by not going up against it.
[00:15:35.859 --> 00:15:39.682]  And it's like being beat up once a week by a bully at school, you finally decide to fight back.
[00:15:40.963 --> 00:15:48.169]  And even if you lose the fight, they'll move on to somebody weaker because you fought back and bloodied their nose as well.
[00:15:49.301 --> 00:15:53.103]  And politically, not physically, it's time to start bloodying the establishment's nose.
[00:15:54.543 --> 00:16:17.513]  And that's what it's going to do when doctors and nurses don't shut up and go public with what the head of the Retired Border Patrol Union has said, what Border Patrol active duty officers have told us, point blank, here in Austin and in Las Vegas at a medical conference Dr. Group was attending.
[00:16:19.229 --> 00:16:22.051]  That yes, they're whisking people away and disappearing them.
[00:16:24.073 --> 00:16:29.217]  Now, if they were doing that to stop panic, it would still be illegal and dangerous.
[00:16:29.317 --> 00:16:31.539]  But you could argue, don't want to create a panic.
[00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:35.662]  Not when they're letting the flight still in and clearly letting it spread.
[00:16:35.702 --> 00:16:42.667]  So see, they want the tyranny to whisk away whoever they want and create that precedent with secret medical armies backed up by paramilitary.
[00:16:43.348 --> 00:16:47.311]  They want to introduce the idea of this going on while letting the crisis intensify.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:52.902]  Former Top Border Patrol Agent, CDC Disappearing Potential Ebola Victims.
[00:16:53.362 --> 00:16:57.925]  That's from October 10th, 2014, 13 days ago.
[00:17:00.326 --> 00:17:01.807]  And I'll continue reading from the article.
[00:17:02.968 --> 00:17:05.109]  Former Border Patrol Agent Zach Taylor
[00:17:06.445 --> 00:17:16.112]  Has divulged that the CDC is working with Border Patrol authorities and the Department of Homeland Security to disappear potential Ebola victims attempting to cross the border into the United States.
[00:17:16.973 --> 00:17:28.421]  I want Don Salazar and Curt Nemo and Kit Daniels and Paul Watson and Steve Watson and Mikhail Thelen to all write about this from your own angle.
[00:17:29.362 --> 00:17:33.505]  With Zach Taylor and these medical doctors, whatever angle you want to go with,
[00:17:34.514 --> 00:17:39.595]  But showing the history of them aiding and abetting the Ebola virus to try to raise the alarm.
[00:17:40.415 --> 00:17:42.616]  And Watson's usually listening, but he's over in England.
[00:17:42.636 --> 00:17:43.476]  He went back to London.
[00:17:43.496 --> 00:17:44.716]  He visited with us for three weeks.
[00:17:45.156 --> 00:17:49.277]  He's thinking about coming here part-time in the years to work over here with us.
[00:17:50.518 --> 00:17:51.138]  Call Watson.
[00:17:51.538 --> 00:17:54.138]  Have him call Steve.
[00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:55.699]  They need to tune in to what you're about to hear.
[00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:33.315]  See, when I'm up here talking about genderless gingerbread figurines and the mayor wanting to arrest, because that's what the subpoenas were for a criminal investigation, of preachers that speak out against homosexuality, what are we doing with stores saying we're only going to have genderless gingerbread people to not offend folks, and they want to arrest preachers for reading out of the Bible?
[00:18:34.485 --> 00:18:37.046]  And you've got all these mystery illnesses flooding across the border.
[00:18:41.066 --> 00:18:44.587]  And you've got people still rioting in St.
[00:18:44.627 --> 00:18:47.048]  Louis and Ferguson.
[00:18:50.548 --> 00:18:54.609]  And Africa has clearly been hit by some type of bioweapon, souped up Ebola.
[00:18:55.389 --> 00:18:57.170]  We had Francis Boyle that wrote the U.S.
[00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:00.531]  Biological Weapons Treaty that got adopted worldwide.
[00:19:01.091 --> 00:19:02.391]  Biological weapons expert.
[00:19:04.687 --> 00:19:11.168]  Dr. Francis Boyle, who's also a lawyer, and he says it's a government operation.
[00:19:11.588 --> 00:19:14.529]  Wayne Madsen, formerly the NSA, says it's a government operation.
[00:19:14.569 --> 00:19:15.129]  Names, names.
[00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:18.950]  The African scientists are saying that.
[00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:27.832]  We have BBC pieces, video pieces from the 90s admitting the South African government created weaponized airborne Ebola and stuff to sterilize blacks.
[00:19:28.712 --> 00:19:32.793]  I mean, I wish all this intel wasn't just rolling in.
[00:19:33.686 --> 00:19:42.052]  You think we like breaking, one week after Benghazi, that it was a hit of the ambassador because he didn't want to transfer Stinger missiles to Al-Qaeda?
[00:19:43.553 --> 00:19:50.037]  And that we predicted they would then say prepare for the Stinger attacks in the West, which they're now doing, but never pointing out that our government armed them?
[00:19:51.678 --> 00:19:52.939]  Do you think it's fun?
[00:19:52.959 --> 00:20:01.145]  I just want you to know, for people that are new listeners that go, oh this is off the chart crazy, this stuff's too intense, I'm sorry, that's what's really going on.
[00:20:03.217 --> 00:20:05.238]  I don't want this to be this way either, okay?
[00:20:07.539 --> 00:20:09.560]  But what does this tell us about our government?
[00:20:11.841 --> 00:20:24.788]  Major medical doctors have told us off record, people I know good, that Ebola is spreading in the U.S.
[00:20:26.169 --> 00:20:27.990]  in major hospitals all over the place.
[00:20:29.551 --> 00:20:31.672]  And they're whisking the people away and they don't know where.
[00:20:32.517 --> 00:20:39.621]  And they're telling them shut up and say that it's some type of African fever or jungle fever or that it's some type of malaria.
[00:20:40.781 --> 00:20:41.322]  When it's not.
[00:20:43.022 --> 00:20:45.884]  Malaria doesn't cause big bloody pustules all over you.
[00:20:50.862 --> 00:20:51.623]  We're going to go to break.
[00:20:52.264 --> 00:20:57.771]  I'm going to try to get my mind focused and say a little prayer for my family and everybody else, because we're all in this together.
[00:20:58.612 --> 00:21:00.855]  This is how they're bringing in the world government, a stage crisis.
[00:21:00.875 --> 00:21:04.920]  This is what the North American Union documents show from 2007 Banff, Canada.
[00:21:05.481 --> 00:21:06.062]  We'll be right back.
[00:21:09.242 --> 00:21:13.407]  Do you lay awake at night and worry about the health and safety of you and your loved ones?
[00:21:13.627 --> 00:21:17.473]  Do you wonder what would happen if you weren't able to get to a hospital or doctor?
[00:21:17.733 --> 00:21:22.780]  How can you keep your family safe against the deadly pathogens that are beginning to emerge in the world today?
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.263]  Give yourself peace of mind with Supernatural Silver.
[00:21:26.723 --> 00:21:33.669]  Supernatural Silver is turning heads around the world as a new weapon in the fight against bacteria, viruses and fungus.

[00:22:10.066 --> 00:22:12.127]  Mike Stenerson from Midas Resources.
[00:22:12.347 --> 00:22:15.508]  At no time in history have precious metals been more important.
[00:22:15.688 --> 00:22:18.169]  Certainly not in my 22 years in the industry.
[00:22:18.409 --> 00:22:22.090]  The dollar has lost over 90% of its value in the last 60 years.
[00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:25.851]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.
[00:22:26.111 --> 00:22:27.212]  Ours is not immune.
[00:22:27.532 --> 00:22:29.172]  The time is now to be proactive.
[00:22:29.192 --> 00:22:29.752]  1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[00:22:34.514 --> 00:22:36.856]  Anything tied to the dollar is at risk.
[00:22:37.216 --> 00:22:41.640]  CDs, annuities, 401Ks, IRAs, stocks, bonds, you name it.
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:42.581]  So decide.
[00:22:42.821 --> 00:22:45.944]  Do you want to leave a legacy of wealth or debt for your family?
[00:22:46.164 --> 00:22:47.125]  The choice is yours.
[00:22:47.465 --> 00:22:48.506]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[00:22:48.586 --> 00:22:49.587]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[00:22:58.194 --> 00:22:59.979]  Be proactive, not reactive.
[00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:00.882]  Call 1-800-686-2237, extension 116.
[00:23:08.704 --> 00:23:11.706]  In today's unstable environment, self-protection is critical.
[00:23:11.786 --> 00:23:13.388]  Civil unrest, riots, looting.
[00:23:13.548 --> 00:23:15.709]  It's happening now, right here in the United States.
[00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:17.351]  And your rights are at risk.
[00:23:17.631 --> 00:23:21.654]  If passed, HR 5344 would ban level 3 and above body armor.
[00:23:21.994 --> 00:23:23.915]  KD Armor is standing up for you.
[00:23:24.156 --> 00:23:27.218]  We offer the most affordable level 3 body armor on the market.
[00:23:27.278 --> 00:23:31.621]  KD Level 3 Armor withstands pistol and rifle hits up to 7.62 NATO.

[00:23:35.864 --> 00:23:36.505]  KD Armor.
[00:23:36.645 --> 00:23:37.506]  Come and take it.
[00:23:38.146 --> 00:23:39.187]  Your house is dark.
[00:23:39.547 --> 00:23:39.967]  Vacant.
[00:23:40.207 --> 00:23:42.569]  You must be gone on vacation for a while.
[00:23:42.589 --> 00:23:44.050]  Thanks for all the jewelry.
[00:23:44.671 --> 00:23:46.672]  Don't be the next victim of a break-in.
[00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:55.238]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone is inside watching TV and makes your home unappealing to would-be thieves.
[00:23:55.458 --> 00:23:56.739]  Don't these people ever leave?
[00:23:56.859 --> 00:23:58.480]  Starting at $24.95.
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.681]  And there's free shipping.
[00:23:59.941 --> 00:24:04.504]  Go to Faketv.com or ask for it at your local hardware store.
[00:24:04.524 --> 00:24:05.685]  Faketv.
[00:24:05.885 --> 00:24:07.046]  The Burglar Deterrent.
[00:24:07.706 --> 00:24:11.353]  We all have our own idea about what being safe and secure means.
[00:24:11.674 --> 00:24:16.944]  The doors lock, bills are paid, you've got a job that keeps the lights on, and a home to call your own.
[00:24:17.204 --> 00:24:19.528]  But what happens when Mother Nature throws a curveball?
[00:24:22.411 --> 00:24:26.315]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time?
[00:24:26.676 --> 00:24:28.217]  Do you even have a plan B?
[00:24:28.798 --> 00:24:31.861]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[00:24:32.081 --> 00:24:34.664]  Children left with no homes and no one's coming to help them.
[00:24:35.165 --> 00:24:38.008]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster.
[00:24:38.208 --> 00:24:38.588]  I think so.
[00:25:33.087 --> 00:25:34.187]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:25:34.287 --> 00:25:37.528]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:25:42.189 --> 00:25:59.654]  And this office, myself included, have talked to multiple doctors, medical doctors, one of them that heads up a major hospital operation, multiple hospitals, that indeed Ebola
[00:26:00.967 --> 00:26:02.869]  What they believe is Ebola is showing up.
[00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:20.128]  We are getting whistleblower contacts now pouring in from Customs and Border Enforcement and other agencies confirming what we've gotten from our other ICE sources and our medical doctor sources.
[00:26:21.718 --> 00:26:36.942]  That there are people that have Ebola-like symptoms coming off of West African flights all over the United States, and they're being ordered to release them when they screen positive for Ebola with the first test.
[00:26:39.362 --> 00:26:45.644]  And by that, the first test just shows that it's probable that you have it, and that you need to go for further screening and an official test.
[00:26:46.854 --> 00:26:48.875]  And they just were ordered to release them.
[00:26:50.095 --> 00:26:55.157]  This is the type of intel with people saying, I work for ICE.
[00:26:55.237 --> 00:26:56.057]  Here's my number.
[00:26:56.237 --> 00:26:57.138]  Call me at lunch.
[00:26:59.158 --> 00:27:04.160]  And then we call these people, medical doctors and others, and they give us their info and who they are.
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.961]  And we call them on the hospital phone and get them on at the hospital.
[00:27:08.121 --> 00:27:10.202]  Separate from people we know.
[00:27:12.343 --> 00:27:15.064]  So obviously what we're going to do here today
[00:27:19.426 --> 00:27:40.627]  is open the phones up after this doctor that's coming on a few minutes the next segment leaves us so that more medical doctors, nurses, nurse practitioners, border patrol, customs enforcement, TSA, you name it
[00:27:41.834 --> 00:27:47.696]  Police officers show you can call in, and if you want to go on record, you can.
[00:27:47.776 --> 00:27:49.397]  We'll call you, vet who you are.
[00:27:50.417 --> 00:27:53.258]  We have folks send us a copy of their driver's license.
[00:27:53.798 --> 00:27:54.798]  We call you at work.
[00:27:55.919 --> 00:27:56.539]  That's what we do.
[00:27:56.579 --> 00:28:04.902]  We don't just get a call from a guy saying he's a medical doctor and then just believe it.
[00:28:05.702 --> 00:28:07.763]  We go and find them on the hospital website.
[00:28:10.424 --> 00:28:11.344]  We call them up at work.
[00:28:13.482 --> 00:28:14.442]  We talk to them at work.
[00:28:16.643 --> 00:28:17.163]  What we do.
[00:28:26.504 --> 00:28:28.665]  It's not just that they're letting the Ebola spread.
[00:28:28.685 --> 00:28:29.685]  It's that they're covering it up.
[00:28:31.385 --> 00:28:33.025]  And I guess they think they can contain it.
[00:28:33.945 --> 00:28:35.246]  Or maybe they want it to be out of control.
[00:28:35.406 --> 00:28:35.786]  I don't know.
[00:28:36.066 --> 00:28:36.966]  I just know it's criminal.
[00:28:37.426 --> 00:28:38.266]  It's out of control.
[00:28:38.746 --> 00:28:42.307]  And what does it say about the people running this country?
[00:28:43.257 --> 00:28:51.402]  The British for two months plus have sealed their borders and don't let flights in from West Africa and screen people who jumped from other countries.
[00:28:51.422 --> 00:28:53.343]  They have a global database of where you came from.
[00:28:57.126 --> 00:28:59.787]  Interpol databases, other databases, credit card records.
[00:29:00.768 --> 00:29:02.569]  That's all run through the computers to begin with.
[00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:03.830]  Worldwide.
[00:29:05.444 --> 00:29:13.650]  Unless you live in the middle of nowhere and you're going and paying some small airline, you know, in some ten-seater or six-seater to fly you over the mountain in Alaska.
[00:29:14.471 --> 00:29:19.795]  Unless you're flying on planes that way, or you're hitching a ride with somebody who's a private pilot, you're in the system.
[00:29:19.815 --> 00:29:25.699]  And there aren't a lot of private pilots flying in out of West Africa into North America, I'll assure you.
[00:29:28.556 --> 00:29:39.041]  So, they know what's going on, and it's so bold, it's so crazy, it's got so many angles, it gives me a headache.
[00:29:42.582 --> 00:29:45.503]  Interpol, yeah, is moving with face scanning globally when you travel.
[00:29:45.803 --> 00:29:47.004]  By the way, Interpol's worldwide.
[00:29:48.643 --> 00:30:00.665]  By the way, the head of Interpol earlier this year said that they should arm everyone worldwide and that would stop Islamists attacking shopping malls and other facilities like the Parliament.
[00:30:03.286 --> 00:30:08.406]  And the sad part about this is the West doesn't even differentiate radical Islamists from regular Muslims.
[00:30:08.667 --> 00:30:09.627]  And there is a big difference.
[00:30:10.267 --> 00:30:11.687]  Most Muslim Jews want to live in peace.
[00:30:11.707 --> 00:30:16.748]  They're always being attacked by the jihadis, being funded by the West and by Saudi Arabia and others.
[00:30:19.983 --> 00:30:21.865]  And what stopped the bad guy up in Ottawa?
[00:30:21.885 --> 00:30:22.545]  Somebody with a gun.
[00:30:23.166 --> 00:30:25.087]  But that all pales in significance.
[00:30:27.289 --> 00:30:28.630]  And they're acting like it's the end of the world.
[00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:31.993]  It's being called the news the Battle of Ottawa.
[00:30:34.235 --> 00:30:34.776]  Two people dead.
[00:30:36.537 --> 00:30:36.998]  Meanwhile...
[00:30:38.055 --> 00:30:40.937]  We talked to medical doctors and they tell us there's a cover-up going on.
[00:30:40.957 --> 00:30:46.260]  We're going to talk to one of those doctors straight ahead on the other side of this break.
[00:30:46.701 --> 00:30:47.361]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:47.401 --> 00:30:49.102]  Tell your friends and family to tune in right now.

[00:30:53.625 --> 00:30:54.065]  Stay with us.
[00:30:59.009 --> 00:30:59.929]  We're on the march.
[00:31:00.409 --> 00:31:02.010]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:31:02.931 --> 00:31:05.633]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:31:09.847 --> 00:31:19.373]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[00:31:19.513 --> 00:31:29.258]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:31:29.438 --> 00:31:32.340]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:33.181]  I think so.
[00:31:47.517 --> 00:31:47.777]  We're good.
[00:32:09.895 --> 00:32:20.080]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:26.862]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:32:26.923 --> 00:32:29.164]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:32:29.264 --> 00:32:32.325]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.

[00:32:39.668 --> 00:32:43.190]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:47.292]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:32:47.612 --> 00:32:49.073]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:32:49.393 --> 00:32:54.416]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.

[00:33:09.366 --> 00:33:11.007]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[00:33:11.308 --> 00:33:15.110]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[00:33:15.851 --> 00:33:20.174]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[00:33:20.314 --> 00:33:27.099]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[00:33:27.619 --> 00:33:36.686]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:33:36.886 --> 00:33:42.368]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.

[00:34:27.179 --> 00:34:30.680]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:42.464]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:34:42.685 --> 00:34:51.087]  I'll tell you, the news that I've been gathering over the last few weeks is extremely painful.
[00:34:51.228 --> 00:34:52.348]  I'm an American.
[00:34:53.188 --> 00:34:55.189]  I'm a father of three children.
[00:34:57.486 --> 00:34:58.606]  I live in Texas.
[00:34:58.726 --> 00:35:00.147]  I have family in Dallas.
[00:35:00.167 --> 00:35:00.987]  It's my hometown.
[00:35:03.468 --> 00:35:25.635]  And in the last, really, two weeks, we talked to Dr. Edward Group, who was at a medical conference in Vegas, who talked to senior members of the Border Patrol and ICE, who were there trying to find alternative treatments and ways to bolster the Border Patrol and ICE's immune system and for their families.
[00:35:26.724 --> 00:35:35.728]  And they brought up former deputy head of the Border Patrol and now the head of the Retirees Union, Zach Taylor.
[00:35:37.268 --> 00:35:47.372]  And they said that his intel was that indeed they had CDC vehicles on the border and were picking up people they believed had Ebola and were whisking them away to unknown facilities.
[00:35:49.293 --> 00:35:52.395]  Then, I was contacted by a
[00:35:54.378 --> 00:36:01.823]  Medical doctor who manages a very large hospital that has other hospitals outside of it.
[00:36:02.103 --> 00:36:02.804]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:36:04.065 --> 00:36:09.048]  Who lived in Austin previously, lives in another major Texas city.
[00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:12.911]  I'll just say this, it has a pro football team.
[00:36:15.103 --> 00:36:16.103]  I'm already saying too much.
[00:36:16.164 --> 00:36:28.389]  The point is, he said exactly what the gentleman is about to say right now, and I was sitting on this for a week, trying to talk to other medical doctors I know in major cities, and they wouldn't talk to me.
[00:36:28.429 --> 00:36:35.012]  They just said, what you're hearing is what we're hearing, and we've got what looks like confirmation of it, but don't you say you talk to me.
[00:36:35.392 --> 00:36:36.853]  I don't want to lose my license or worse.
[00:36:38.297 --> 00:36:39.597]  They are disappearing people.
[00:36:39.717 --> 00:36:44.219]  Now that's exactly what senior members of the current Border Patrol told us.
[00:36:44.759 --> 00:36:46.019]  And we have those whistleblowers.
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:54.822]  We were directed by some of these sources, as you know, three months ago, the New York Times later picked it up and admitted it was true, to McAllen, Texas.
[00:36:54.842 --> 00:36:57.783]  And then we're going to our guest.
[00:37:00.504 --> 00:37:05.766]  Where the Border Patrol was loading the illegals and their kids up on buses with vouchers into the rest of the country.
[00:37:06.046 --> 00:37:07.126]  So our sources are good.
[00:37:10.239 --> 00:37:29.273]  Now, we're joined by James Lorenzi and he works, Dr. Lorenzi works at the Cass Regional Medical Center in Garden City, Missouri.
[00:37:30.922 --> 00:37:40.787]  And he holds a DO and bachelor's degree in chemistry from Drury University and received his medical degree from Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences.
[00:37:41.347 --> 00:37:46.190]  He completed his internship and residency in family medicine at Truman Lakewood Medical Center
[00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:50.554]  And is affiliated with the Harrisonville Family Medicine, Inc.
[00:37:50.814 --> 00:38:03.767]  In addition to his practices in Archie Medical Clinic and Garden City Medical Clinic, Dr. Lorenzi serves as the collaborating physician for nurses, practitioners, and it goes through all of that.
[00:38:04.861 --> 00:38:17.968]  He joins us, he's a doctor of osteopathic medicine, which is another branch of the MDs, and he's saying exactly what a major medical doctor that I know personally told me, shaking with fear.
[00:38:19.284 --> 00:38:19.764]  A week ago.
[00:38:19.964 --> 00:38:29.968]  And this is why I have trouble even doing the broadcast, why I've been very upset around the office, is because we're trying to document all this, and as we document it, it's horrifying.
[00:38:30.529 --> 00:38:36.031]  Now, he's got to leave, he's got patients in 10 minutes, so we're going to go to him, he'll be back on in the next few days for a full hour.
[00:38:36.471 --> 00:38:39.372]  We want to encourage other medical doctors or medical workers to call in.
[00:38:39.612 --> 00:38:43.634]  We can vet who you are, either protect your identity, or if you want to go public, that's fine.
[00:38:43.834 --> 00:38:47.576]  Well, about four weeks ago, when the Symbola thing really started taking off here in the United States,
[00:39:12.785 --> 00:39:15.747]  All of a sudden, you start hearing about patients possibly having Ebola.
[00:39:15.927 --> 00:39:17.868]  The hospitals were beginning to test for it.
[00:39:19.369 --> 00:39:35.020]  Well, a friend of mine that's a resident at Truman Medical Center, which is where I did my residency at, called me and said, hey, we've got a possible Ebola patient here, and he's bleeding out of all of his... I'm not going to use the language to use, but he's bleeding out of all of his orifices.
[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:38.863]  He's in septic shock, hypotensive, high fever.
[00:39:38.923 --> 00:39:42.505]  He was visiting Africa, or he was from Africa, I believe.
[00:39:43.252 --> 00:39:43.872]  I'm good to go.
[00:40:06.856 --> 00:40:13.062]  And I told him to let me know, because I wanted to call your show, I wanted to let people know that, hey, we've got a case here in Kansas City.
[00:40:13.102 --> 00:40:16.906]  Well, he called me back the next day and said they disappeared the patient.
[00:40:16.926 --> 00:40:18.387]  I said, what do you mean they disappeared him?
[00:40:18.407 --> 00:40:19.728]  Because the patient's gone.
[00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:28.176]  They were told that he left AMA, which means against medical advice, but the guy wasn't, he couldn't even, he wouldn't have been able to leave.
[00:40:28.357 --> 00:40:29.698]  I mean, he was just in that bad of a shape.
[00:40:30.749 --> 00:40:37.354]  I said, well, look for John Doe, which is the name that they use in hospitals in case, you know, somebody's admitted that they don't know who you are.
[00:40:37.834 --> 00:40:40.936]  And there was no John Doe's in the hospital, so they said the patient disappeared.
[00:40:41.496 --> 00:40:51.503]  Well, the following day, they had a meeting with anybody that had contact with that patient and said that he didn't have Ebola, he had malaria.
[00:40:52.464 --> 00:40:57.988]  Well, all of a sudden, that's when we heard that all these other cases in these other cities
[00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:00.410]  They were coming back and saying, no, they didn't have Ebola.
[00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:01.350]  They had malaria.
[00:41:01.591 --> 00:41:05.551]  That seemed to like... That's what they were told to tell everybody.
[00:41:07.051 --> 00:41:13.893]  Well, then we had a second patient at Research Medical Center that was rumored to have... I have friends there, too.
[00:41:13.933 --> 00:41:16.053]  They called me and said, we have a possible Ebola patient.
[00:41:16.233 --> 00:41:17.293]  That patient disappeared.
[00:41:18.833 --> 00:41:26.355]  There was a patient more recently at KU Medical Center, which is just across from the Kansas side, about 20 minutes from here.
[00:41:28.214 --> 00:41:33.935]  That patient, I don't know what the status of that patient is, but they came out and said they didn't have, people love to say, typhoid.
[00:41:36.116 --> 00:41:47.198]  So there, something very, very strange is going on, and I wouldn't have thought much about it, but this is happening in other areas of the country, not only in Kansas City.
[00:41:47.478 --> 00:41:48.618]  These patients are disappearing.
[00:41:48.658 --> 00:41:51.919]  They're doing something on the patient's side, and God knows where they're going.
[00:41:53.663 --> 00:41:58.445]  Well, we have flights into Houston, flights into New York from Nigeria.
[00:41:58.865 --> 00:42:01.406]  That's the country the Ebola people are getting into to fly out.
[00:42:01.446 --> 00:42:03.267]  That's the major airline hub.
[00:42:03.547 --> 00:42:06.628]  They come from other African nations in most cases.
[00:42:06.688 --> 00:42:15.292]  They die vomiting on airplanes, or they're found dead in pools of blood and vomit and feces, not to get too detailed here, in Houston.
[00:42:16.272 --> 00:42:23.583]  And they're just told instantly Ebola ruled out before they even get the dead body off the plane in the case of JFK.
[00:42:24.023 --> 00:42:27.148]  But the telltale sign is the medical people don't want to be around it.
[00:42:27.468 --> 00:42:29.491]  The folks cleaning up the airplanes are on strike.
[00:42:29.771 --> 00:42:31.814]  They're scared saying there's vomit all over the place.
[00:42:32.655 --> 00:42:40.823]  It looks like there is a flood of refugees, medical refugees, out of West Africa here, because other African countries won't let them in.
[00:42:40.843 --> 00:42:46.628]  I mean, undoubtedly, if two nurses got Ebola from patient zero,
[00:42:47.529 --> 00:42:53.012]  And then now they say it's all stopped when this guy was running around for a week and a half vomiting everywhere, doctor.
[00:42:53.292 --> 00:42:54.753]  Does that make any sense to you?
[00:42:54.773 --> 00:43:00.916]  I mean, what you're saying and what others are telling us is that this is happening in Dallas, you name it, the same thing.
[00:43:00.956 --> 00:43:02.237]  They come in, they disappear them.
[00:43:02.477 --> 00:43:05.478]  We have it from the Border Patrol that the same thing's going on.
[00:43:05.498 --> 00:43:10.101]  Do you think they're trying to cover this up so there won't be a panic?
[00:43:10.401 --> 00:43:13.443]  If they were doing that, why would they then
[00:43:15.187 --> 00:43:16.649]  Uh, not stop the flights.
[00:43:17.309 --> 00:43:25.215]  I mean, it'd be one thing if they were disappearing people to army bases, which they were supposed to to begin with, is just publicly take them there, where they're level four.
[00:43:25.235 --> 00:43:25.956]  That's the default.
[00:43:26.697 --> 00:43:31.140]  But then why would they still let them come in and then let people that have it spread it?
[00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:35.364]  And why would the CDC tell a nurse that treated an Ebola patient, hey, I have a fever.
[00:43:35.404 --> 00:43:37.966]  Is it okay if I fly to visit family?
[00:43:38.726 --> 00:43:39.607]  And they tell her, yes.
[00:43:39.927 --> 00:43:41.429]  What does this sound like to you?
[00:43:43.477 --> 00:43:45.118]  There's several different scenarios.
[00:43:45.238 --> 00:43:48.740]  I mean, either they're deliberately trying to cause us to spread, number one.
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:50.221]  Number two, they don't want to cause a panic.
[00:43:50.261 --> 00:43:53.623]  And there's hundreds or thousands of people that already have it.
[00:43:54.483 --> 00:43:58.065]  And it's just a matter of time before people become aware of this.
[00:43:58.085 --> 00:44:02.328]  They're trying to delay it as much as possible so they can get ready to try to deal with the panic.
[00:44:03.608 --> 00:44:08.731]  Or, um... That's the way it makes no sense.
[00:44:08.771 --> 00:44:10.192]  We're told that our hospital
[00:44:10.782 --> 00:44:11.463]  Yeah, we're good.
[00:44:30.831 --> 00:44:31.832]  Dr. Lorenzi, stay there.
[00:44:31.852 --> 00:44:32.892]  That is bombshell.
[00:44:33.433 --> 00:44:34.233]  That just clicked.
[00:44:34.353 --> 00:44:40.577]  They've been ordered in major cities two weeks ago on the police networks in New York.
[00:44:40.637 --> 00:44:44.080]  The firefighters and others have been told, do not use the word Ebola.
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:45.200]  Use code words.
[00:44:45.841 --> 00:44:48.603]  And there's the Daily Mail headline for TV viewers.
[00:44:48.983 --> 00:44:51.725]  So clearly we know there's a cover-up going on.
[00:44:52.025 --> 00:44:53.326]  That's key proof right there.
[00:44:53.366 --> 00:44:53.986]  That is amazing.
[00:44:54.226 --> 00:44:59.850]  So you specifically and others have been told, do not let people know there's an Ebola case?
[00:45:03.107 --> 00:45:05.590]  Okay, please go to your next point, excuse me.
[00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:18.242]  Well, another interesting thing that I found out from several nurses and from drug reps that come to our hospital, to my office, they have contact with various people around the city.
[00:45:18.342 --> 00:45:25.770]  And HVA, which is one of the big hospital companies that owns a lot of hospitals in the country, they own several in Kansas City,
[00:45:26.485 --> 00:45:38.594]  They went two days ago, three days ago now, they went and they took all of the gear, the protective equipment, away from all the different departments without replacing it with anything.
[00:45:38.634 --> 00:45:40.315]  They took the N95 masks, they took their
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:43.881]  You are just dropping bombshell after bombshell.
[00:45:43.901 --> 00:45:48.083]  So it's fair, we'll just basically have no protection or just wear a mask.
[00:45:48.123 --> 00:45:49.004]  That is amazing.
[00:46:13.991 --> 00:46:24.374]  So they don't want people in spacesuits at hospitals, even though it'll protect them, because that would cause a panic.
[00:46:24.394 --> 00:46:26.715]  It's all about the image.
[00:46:26.735 --> 00:46:28.216]  It's all about the optics.
[00:46:40.134 --> 00:46:49.557]  Stupid little package that contained an N95 mask, some booties, gloves, and a gown, and told us that if we have a suspected Ebola case, put this on.
[00:46:50.457 --> 00:46:57.919]  And they told the office staff to ask, this is a screening process now that we're told to do, ask them if they've traveled anywhere.
[00:46:58.059 --> 00:47:01.420]  And they said, okay, well, if they have, if they've traveled, did they come back from Africa?
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:01.840]  Then what?
[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:03.140]  Well, we don't know.
[00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:03.961]  Just ask them.
[00:47:04.301 --> 00:47:08.862]  And that's the screening process that we're told to do at this point in time.
[00:47:12.028 --> 00:47:17.113]  Yeah, that's like telling somebody they can jump out of an airplane at 10,000 feet with an umbrella as a parachute.
[00:47:19.115 --> 00:47:26.642]  I mean, the reason I'm coming on here is I'm hoping to find out from other physicians around the country or medical personnel, is this going on just here?
[00:47:26.702 --> 00:47:28.363]  Is it just our hospitals in Kansas City?
[00:47:28.403 --> 00:47:29.745]  Or is this going on everywhere?
[00:47:29.785 --> 00:47:31.947]  I think I already know the answer to that.
[00:47:34.508 --> 00:47:35.669]  It's time to not be afraid.
[00:47:35.729 --> 00:47:37.050]  I mean, it's just a piece of paper.
[00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:37.751]  It's a medical license.
[00:47:37.771 --> 00:47:40.272]  I mean, if they pull my license for this, so be it.
[00:47:40.352 --> 00:47:42.274]  I mean, we need to get this information out.
[00:47:42.314 --> 00:47:43.675]  This is serious.
[00:47:43.895 --> 00:47:44.555]  Well, that's right.
[00:47:45.176 --> 00:47:50.439]  I mean, they used to tell radio stations, don't criticize the President or the FCC might take your license.
[00:47:50.479 --> 00:47:51.700]  What is this, Soviet Russia?
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.221]  What happened to the First Amendment?
[00:47:55.529 --> 00:48:00.896]  You shouldn't have to be part of a criminal conspiracy to cover up Ebola and lie to people.
[00:48:01.797 --> 00:48:05.201]  You should get an award for doing the right thing, not be penalized.
[00:48:05.261 --> 00:48:09.366]  But the right thing to do is the right thing to do, and there's strength in numbers.
[00:48:09.406 --> 00:48:12.810]  We need more people, as you said, to call in here.
[00:48:14.298 --> 00:48:19.659]  In fact, we have a guest coming up, and he's a very important guest on the economy front, Harry Dent.
[00:48:20.659 --> 00:48:27.201]  I am tempted to try to move him to 1230, or move him to another day, just because I need to open the phones up.
[00:48:27.961 --> 00:48:39.243]  Specifically, this is such huge news, it's even bigger than the economy, because this will tank the economy if we don't get the word out on it, but Dr. James Lorenzi, thank you for your courage.
[00:48:39.943 --> 00:48:42.904]  Specifically, why do you think the other medical doctors we're talking to
[00:48:43.999 --> 00:48:44.979]  It doesn't make any sense.
[00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:48.141]  I'm not afraid of doing the right thing.
[00:48:48.161 --> 00:48:54.904]  I think it's the cops out here that are afraid of maybe their employers, maybe losing their jobs, causing them to stir.
[00:49:14.543 --> 00:49:16.345]  To me it makes no sense.
[00:49:16.605 --> 00:49:20.829]  There's no other option than doing something like this to wake people up.
[00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:22.090]  It's the right thing to do.
[00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:23.872]  That's why we went into medicine, to help people.
[00:49:24.533 --> 00:49:28.096]  It just becomes so bureaucratic.
[00:49:28.136 --> 00:49:30.118]  There's so much bureaucracy now in medicine.
[00:49:30.558 --> 00:49:30.899]  I don't know.
[00:49:30.939 --> 00:49:32.540]  I can't answer why they're not coming out.
[00:49:33.001 --> 00:49:34.362]  It makes no sense to me.
[00:49:37.284 --> 00:49:46.675]  Well, you're near a major city, and so that's why you're also seeing in a lot of smaller towns or regions that aren't in the major thoroughfares probably haven't seen this hit yet.
[00:49:47.075 --> 00:49:54.324]  In the few minutes we've got left with you, Doctor, I want to get you back again tonight on the Nightly News if you can, or tomorrow for another update, and then obviously Sunday.
[00:49:55.645 --> 00:50:01.650]  We are having a bunch of whistleblowers contact us in government, you name it, including Ebola screeners at airports.
[00:50:02.031 --> 00:50:05.854]  It's just we have to process all that investigative material as well.
[00:50:06.915 --> 00:50:10.618]  So it's important for people to continue to blow the whistle and to blow the whistle to others.
[00:50:11.278 --> 00:50:15.822]  Because I think a lot of this is just ignorance, but we do need whistleblowers to call in.
[00:50:15.842 --> 00:50:18.944]  We need them to confirm or deny this or give us more intel.
[00:50:19.264 --> 00:50:22.847]  The problem is, I've already confirmed what you're saying from folks in Texas.
[00:50:24.008 --> 00:50:27.230]  Anything else you'd like to add out there for listeners?
[00:50:29.472 --> 00:50:35.477]  Just be aware, be careful, stay away from places where there's large groups of people.
[00:50:35.597 --> 00:50:40.781]  I really think this is much more serious than they're letting on, whether this is really Ebola or something else.
[00:50:41.351 --> 00:50:42.332]  Something is going on.
[00:50:42.352 --> 00:51:03.345]  They're preparing for something and I think they're delaying the information coming out as long as possible because they're putting whatever system they're trying to put into place, whether it's the martial law situation or if they're going to, you know, because some of those executive orders Obama signed takes over all medical personnel.
[00:51:03.425 --> 00:51:05.907]  And I don't know if they're trying to get that set up.
[00:51:06.487 --> 00:51:06.888]  I don't know.
[00:51:08.601 --> 00:51:11.784]  Keep your eyes and ears open and stay out of hospitals if you can.
[00:51:11.804 --> 00:51:14.046]  That's the worst place in the world to be right now.
[00:51:15.127 --> 00:51:16.568]  Especially flu season coming around.
[00:51:16.628 --> 00:51:17.709]  It's going to be a nightmare.
[00:51:17.949 --> 00:51:23.374]  When flu season hits, people are going to be coming to the hospital for flu or Ebola or they don't know what they have.
[00:51:23.414 --> 00:51:26.236]  It's going to be around a bunch of other people.
[00:51:26.256 --> 00:51:27.817]  It's going to be a nightmare.
[00:51:28.538 --> 00:51:31.741]  Every doctor that I've spoken with is terrified of this fall.
[00:51:33.322 --> 00:51:34.123]  Let me ask you this.
[00:51:34.163 --> 00:51:35.324]  We're going to skip this network break.
[00:51:35.364 --> 00:51:37.806]  I know you've got to go in just a few minutes, but I want to keep it as long as we can.
[00:51:37.846 --> 00:51:38.707]  Tell me when you've got to go.
[00:51:39.447 --> 00:51:45.513]  The other key question, what do the other medical doctors, what do the nurses, what do they think is going on?
[00:51:46.554 --> 00:51:51.138]  Is it a state of concern, a state of not caring, a state of panic, of quiet panic?
[00:51:51.158 --> 00:51:51.738]  What's going on?
[00:51:52.319 --> 00:51:55.442]  Well, a lot of them come up to me and I say, well, I'll let you know when it's starting to panic.
[00:51:55.522 --> 00:51:57.303]  But they are very, very concerned.
[00:51:58.502 --> 00:52:00.846]  Well, especially when you don't have the right gear!
[00:52:13.487 --> 00:52:14.947]  That's correct.
[00:52:15.207 --> 00:52:17.488]  And there's been no training at the hospital.
[00:52:17.588 --> 00:52:22.990]  And I called the Infectious Disease Nurse and said, listen, we need to practice this scenario.
[00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:24.390]  We need to know where to go.
[00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:25.230]  Where's the gear at?
[00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:26.430]  Oh, we've got it covered.
[00:52:26.471 --> 00:52:27.111]  Don't worry about it.
[00:52:27.471 --> 00:52:28.211]  And they don't.
[00:52:28.291 --> 00:52:29.771]  And everybody's freaking out.
[00:52:30.091 --> 00:52:31.612]  It's like nobody knows what to do.
[00:52:31.632 --> 00:52:38.074]  So there is a sense of panic that's slowly occurring, at least at our hospital.
[00:52:38.094 --> 00:52:39.334]  I can't speak for the other hospitals.
[00:52:40.423 --> 00:52:49.050]  The drug reps are actually, I'm getting a lot of information from them because they go around, we see the same reps all the time and kind of develop a personal relationship with them.
[00:52:49.751 --> 00:52:52.913]  And they go around and talk to other doctors and they're telling me the same thing.
[00:52:53.674 --> 00:52:54.655]  That's all they're talking about.
[00:52:55.330 --> 00:52:57.251]  That's what patients are asking about.
[00:52:57.271 --> 00:52:58.892]  They're coming in asking, Doc, what do we do?
[00:52:58.912 --> 00:53:00.793]  I say, I don't know.
[00:53:00.813 --> 00:53:02.274]  Get some colloidal silver.
[00:53:02.294 --> 00:53:04.796]  You know, that's the only thing I know that's going to help you.
[00:53:05.216 --> 00:53:08.758]  And get some N95 masks and stay away from public places.
[00:53:09.178 --> 00:53:11.700]  But people are very concerned about it.
[00:53:13.241 --> 00:53:20.425]  So in your medical opinion, you think there's some evidence showing that colloidal silver is a good alternative antibiotic?
[00:53:21.288 --> 00:53:31.694]  Absolutely, because I actually have a generator that I purchased for my old name, where I got it from, but I spoke with the guy that made it, and he's got some information.
[00:53:31.714 --> 00:53:33.135]  There's actually a U.S.
[00:53:33.155 --> 00:53:37.397]  Army study that I pulled that shows that it does kill Ebola.
[00:53:38.918 --> 00:53:42.721]  They tested it back in, I think it was in the 80s.
[00:53:42.761 --> 00:53:44.161]  Anybody can search for it and find it.
[00:53:44.642 --> 00:53:46.643]  Colonial silver does kill Ebola.
[00:53:47.283 --> 00:53:49.965]  It kills, as well as the flu virus.
[00:53:50.749 --> 00:53:53.730]  I don't think we can say from my view, but I'm not a medical doctor like you, that
[00:54:03.376 --> 00:54:15.903]  I mean, certainly, it could be alternative treatment, has a lot of promising things that it's shown, and I know government itself has been buying heavily into it, while demonizing anybody that tries to talk about any alternative treatment.
[00:54:16.963 --> 00:54:31.692]  I mean, it was well known back during the Black Plague that lots of garlic and vitamin C, they didn't know what vitamin C was, but fruit helped people, you know, not get it because it boosted their immune system, and that's all we're here talking about is obviously staying away
[00:54:32.774 --> 00:54:42.224]  from airports if you can, staying away from international hubs, and quite frankly, West Africans coming off airplanes.
[00:54:42.664 --> 00:54:46.268]  That's a no-brainer when they're set to have a million-plus cases over there.
[00:54:49.082 --> 00:55:16.385]  It's just absolutely vital that we all be vigilant, and I think get the word out here, because if there is a concern, not a panic, then they'll shut down the flights, because if Ebola isn't exponentially spreading, Doc, if more flights pour in, and the World Health Organization estimates that more Ebola flights will end up getting into Western countries, why then, if they admit that, would they allow that to continue with something that kills 70% of people?
[00:55:16.405 --> 00:55:17.226]  What's your view on that?
[00:55:18.649 --> 00:55:30.532]  He's going to prove that his open border policy is a failure in contributing to this, and he can directly correlate that to Obama's policy, and he would truly be, you know, Ebola, as we like to call him now.
[00:55:30.892 --> 00:55:32.113]  I think that's the main reason.
[00:55:32.433 --> 00:55:37.714]  And the only alternative is that they're trying, they want people to get infected.
[00:55:37.774 --> 00:55:39.515]  They want, they need this to occur.
[00:55:39.535 --> 00:55:40.875]  This is their next big crisis.
[00:55:40.995 --> 00:55:44.056]  You know, don't let a crisis go to waste type of a scenario.
[00:55:44.536 --> 00:55:47.857]  And the CDC can play with their toys, they can go out and they can
[00:55:48.314 --> 00:55:57.081]  They can implement the protocols, they can get their airtime, they can be the saviors of the country, but by then it's going to be too late, I think.
[00:55:58.102 --> 00:56:00.544]  Dr. James Lorenzi, thank you so much.
[00:56:00.564 --> 00:56:03.587]  We're going to give you my cell phone number as you leave here.
[00:56:03.627 --> 00:56:04.587]  Please give it to him, guys.
[00:56:04.948 --> 00:56:15.336]  We're going to give you Anthony Gucciardi's cell, Nico Acosta's cell, so that you can get in contact with us, because we've had other whistleblowers before that
[00:56:17.179 --> 00:56:19.481]  You know, had some pretty serious repercussions.
[00:56:19.521 --> 00:56:24.906]  The fact that we're talking to you openly, though, the fact that you put your name out, I think, protects you to a great extent.
[00:56:25.467 --> 00:56:31.152]  In my experience, it's folks that don't give their name, they use the NSA to figure out who was on and then threaten them.
[00:56:31.172 --> 00:56:39.499]  I think the fact that what you're doing is so moral, and most people, even in the government, agree with you, we should all say a prayer for you, a prayer for this nation, but
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:48.388]  As Mark Twain said in the beginning, a patriot's a scarce man, hated, feared, and scorned, but in time when his cause succeeds, the timid join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[00:56:48.729 --> 00:56:50.711]  Thank you for what you've done for my family.
[00:56:51.291 --> 00:57:02.623]  Thank you for what you've done for all of us, and your courage, because we know a lot of Border Patrol people, a lot of medical people, who are saying the exact same thing, including people that have seen it happen in their hospital.
[00:57:03.499 --> 00:57:31.961]  in a major texas city and they're scared to come on and i'm glad they even called me that that took more courage but uh... you you are the equivalent of the info war of our audi murphy coming on here sir so just god bless you doctor well thank you very much and keep up the great work i really enjoy what you do god bless you god bless you we're all in this together you know i went and saw last night fury with brad pitt and i know a lot of world war two sherman tankers who i hunted with when i was a kid they're all dead now
[00:57:32.702 --> 00:57:43.189]  And I'd always try to get them to tell me war stories, and they'd say, kid, imagine a beautiful blonde that looks like Marilyn Monroe walks up with a trench coat, opens it up, and starts shooting at you with a machine gun, and you cut her in half.
[00:57:43.809 --> 00:57:46.451]  Now, let's go hunting, but don't ask me any more war stories.
[00:57:48.172 --> 00:57:54.736]  And so the movie's very accurate from a lot of the reports I've gotten and things, and what it was like over there.
[00:57:54.756 --> 00:58:00.220]  And the story is Audie Murphy, through North Africa, into Italy, into Germany.
[00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:02.681]  And the character is Audie Murphy.
[00:58:02.821 --> 00:58:05.522]  And the reason I'm talking about this is that was a real Audie Murphy we just talked to.
[00:58:06.363 --> 00:58:14.987]  In the Info War, it takes more courage, historically, to do something that's not even military, when you're being backed and told it's okay, than to do something against the grain in your own country.
[00:58:16.268 --> 00:58:17.589]  And they ripped off Audie Murphy.
[00:58:17.649 --> 00:58:27.574]  It's the story of Audie Murphy, except it was one guy killing 300 people at a crossroads against a bunch of SS and Germans and half-cracks.
[00:58:28.154 --> 00:58:29.635]  It was Audie Murphy and he didn't get killed.
[00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:34.541]  And, it's just, that's how screwed up Hollywood is.
[00:58:35.701 --> 00:58:39.483]  Is that it looks like Audie Murphy, you know, Audie Murphy looked like Brad Pitt, or he looks like him.
[00:58:39.903 --> 00:58:40.823]  It is Audie Murphy.
[00:58:42.924 --> 00:58:44.024]  And they don't give him credit!
[00:58:45.185 --> 00:58:45.745]  It's sick!
[00:58:46.725 --> 00:58:48.206]  And they've got him getting killed at the end.
[00:58:49.426 --> 00:58:50.727]  It's just, it's, everything's twisted.
[00:58:50.747 --> 00:58:54.188]  I mean, they should at least say, some of this is based on Audie Murphy, but I didn't see that.
[00:58:57.008 --> 00:58:58.771]  And I don't know why I just digressed off into that.
[00:58:59.031 --> 00:59:04.060]  It's just that we need people that have the moral courage to stand up for this country now or lose everything.
[00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:05.382]  Where are the men out there?
[00:59:06.043 --> 00:59:07.245]  Well, we just talked to one of them.
[00:59:08.286 --> 00:59:09.649]  Dr. James Lorenzi.
[00:59:12.162 --> 00:59:13.704]  And he's like thanking me for what I do.
[00:59:13.724 --> 00:59:16.307]  Hey, we're trying to self-preserve here.
[00:59:16.808 --> 00:59:17.989]  We're trying to do the same thing.
[00:59:18.090 --> 00:59:19.051]  I don't deserve to be thanked.
[00:59:19.351 --> 00:59:20.052]  This is what I do.
[00:59:20.533 --> 00:59:21.955]  This is what I said I wanted to do.
[00:59:21.975 --> 00:59:23.376]  I said I wanted to fight tyranny.
[00:59:23.456 --> 00:59:24.978]  I wanted the truth, the whole truth.
[00:59:25.239 --> 00:59:29.805]  I pray to God every day to sanctify me, to lead God and direct me because I am a wicked devil.
[00:59:30.888 --> 00:59:32.129]  And then I'd be used as a vessel.
[00:59:32.189 --> 00:59:33.709]  I've tried to turn myself over to God.
[00:59:34.330 --> 00:59:36.090]  And this is what I was born to do.
[00:59:36.471 --> 00:59:37.851]  And I know you were born to do this as well.
[00:59:38.372 --> 00:59:41.313]  But I'll tell you, folks, we shouldn't be thanked for what we're doing.
[00:59:41.333 --> 00:59:45.915]  We should be thanking God for giving us the guidance, because this is the time to call on God.
[00:59:46.135 --> 00:59:46.615]  We'll be back.
[00:59:46.655 --> 00:59:47.076]  Stay with us.
[00:59:50.157 --> 00:59:54.459]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:00:11.898 --> 01:00:18.682]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[01:00:54.930 --> 01:00:56.351]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:00:56.511 --> 01:00:56.951]  Got it.
[01:00:57.291 --> 01:00:58.072]  Others don't.
[01:01:01.634 --> 01:01:04.230]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:16.200]  Big Brother.
[01:01:16.881 --> 01:01:17.901]  Mainstream media.
[01:01:18.642 --> 01:01:19.742]  Government cover-ups.
[01:01:20.403 --> 01:01:21.203]  You want answers?
[01:01:21.983 --> 01:01:22.864]  Well, so does he.
[01:01:23.524 --> 01:01:27.186]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:01:27.726 --> 01:01:31.788]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:46.241]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[01:01:48.363 --> 01:02:00.111]  If you just joined us, we had a medical doctor, James Lorenzi, join us from the Cass Regional Medical Center in Garden City, Missouri.
[01:02:02.152 --> 01:02:08.317]  And he has talked to the doctors, to the nurses, with people bleeding out of every orifice, being disappeared,
[01:02:09.531 --> 01:02:12.494]  Out of the books, just gone, being scooped up, and they're freaked out.
[01:02:12.894 --> 01:02:23.363]  They've had their medical gear taken away, and they've talked to the medical drug reps who go around to all the hospitals and they say it's happening at a lot of big medical facilities.
[01:02:23.403 --> 01:02:30.210]  So, I was trying to say, hey, clearly we hope there's not a lot of Ebola cases, but why are they bringing people in?
[01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:33.472]  I know another medical doctor, MD,
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:45.667]  You know, that dinner with, repeatedly, I know well, hung out with probably 10 times, who lives in a major city in Texas.
[01:02:49.329 --> 01:03:06.810]  Doesn't even want that listed, and has confirmed, told us this last week, and we've been ferreting around trying to confirm it, and so, Gucciardi yesterday was on, he said we should get calls about this if this is the case, or he was talking about it, and James Lorenzi, Dr. James Lorenzi called in.
[01:03:08.914 --> 01:03:20.118]  So I won't make you hold if you're a nurse, a medical worker, an EMT, a police officer, a medical manager, a DOD, hazmat person.
[01:03:20.698 --> 01:03:26.120]  If you have seen this or heard this or can confirm this, we're 95% there.
[01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:27.621]  This is going on.
[01:03:28.261 --> 01:03:30.402]  He listed the hospital where it's happening.
[01:03:32.002 --> 01:03:32.783]  Clearly Ebola.
[01:03:35.143 --> 01:03:36.044]  And they're saying it's
[01:03:39.431 --> 01:03:41.172]  Malaria that doesn't have any of the same symptoms.
[01:03:44.455 --> 01:03:45.296]  And people are freaked out.
[01:03:47.758 --> 01:03:49.859]  So I need to hear from you out there.
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:52.601]  Here is the toll-free number, 800-259-9231.
[01:03:53.002 --> 01:04:02.309]  I know most folks that are out there working all the time, like medical doctors and nurses and nurse practitioners and clinic people.
[01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:04.991]  Imagine being the receptionist at these places?
[01:04:06.032 --> 01:04:06.613]  Or the intake?
[01:04:07.554 --> 01:04:12.678]  Can you imagine being the police when these Ebola people are running once this stuff starts spreading and having to go?
[01:04:12.698 --> 01:04:13.739]  I mean, this is going to be a nightmare.
[01:04:14.639 --> 01:04:19.123]  And see, everybody that works for the system that went along with it, you're going to be on the receiving end.
[01:04:19.143 --> 01:04:20.484]  That's what I keep warning everybody.
[01:04:20.504 --> 01:04:24.567]  When a tyranny comes in, or judgment comes upon a nation, it's bad.
[01:04:25.227 --> 01:04:33.193]  For people that are good, average cops, people that are nice guys, nice ladies, that aren't bad people that matter, the system's bad, you're going to be run over by it.
[01:04:34.154 --> 01:04:36.716]  You're going to be where the rubber meets the road, and I wouldn't want to be there.
[01:04:38.268 --> 01:04:38.888]  800-259-9231.
[01:04:38.908 --> 01:04:39.668]  800-259-9231.
[01:04:39.688 --> 01:04:50.611]  And we have senior Border Patrol people telling us and ICE folks the same thing.
[01:04:51.352 --> 01:04:59.454]  And we have just whistleblower contacts via email with the government email headers coming in with the people ready to go public.
[01:05:00.754 --> 01:05:06.456]  And so I got my reporters trying to produce the nightly news and trying to write articles while at the same time trying to go over all this.
[01:05:07.435 --> 01:05:07.936]  Journalism 101.
[01:05:11.747 --> 01:05:14.434]  How will Obama and the globalists get away with this one?
[01:05:15.290 --> 01:05:20.714]  I'm trying to figure out a way this isn't true or this isn't right, or that there's something else that makes you bleed out of every orifice.
[01:05:22.135 --> 01:05:23.836]  But why would they whisk them away and cover it up?
[01:05:23.876 --> 01:05:25.657]  I'm trying to ignore the Border Patrol.
[01:05:25.697 --> 01:05:28.379]  I'm trying to ignore Senior Agent Zack Taylor.
[01:05:29.139 --> 01:05:38.726]  I'm trying to ignore the intel, the common sense, my lying eyes, my gut, everything we've seen, the flights still coming in, people dying, vomiting on the planes.
[01:05:39.526 --> 01:05:45.048]  The airport cleanup crews going on strike three weeks ago because they know what we know.
[01:05:45.669 --> 01:05:47.689]  But everything points towards Ebola.
[01:05:49.310 --> 01:05:52.851]  And the media is attacking me for daring to be pointing all this out.
[01:05:53.752 --> 01:05:57.493]  I'm sure there'll be a price to pay for telling the truth, but that's our job.
[01:05:58.674 --> 01:06:01.275]  I'm not even afraid of the system coming after me.
[01:06:01.315 --> 01:06:03.556]  I'm just afraid of what they'll do to the innocents in this country.
[01:06:04.296 --> 01:06:06.037]  I mean, somebody's got to stop these people.
[01:06:06.097 --> 01:06:06.497]  We'll be back.
[01:06:09.807 --> 01:06:13.308]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:06:13.468 --> 01:06:17.449]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:06:17.749 --> 01:06:19.210]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:06:19.530 --> 01:06:27.112]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:06:27.393 --> 01:06:28.233]  But for how long?
[01:06:28.533 --> 01:06:34.795]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:06:35.155 --> 01:06:37.976]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:06:39.421 --> 01:06:49.627]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[01:06:49.988 --> 01:06:56.071]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:06:56.451 --> 01:06:58.673]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:06:58.773 --> 01:07:01.835]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[01:07:01.875 --> 01:07:08.759]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[01:07:08.979 --> 01:07:09.999]  The experts are clear.
[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:17.282]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[01:07:17.422 --> 01:07:23.665]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:23.685 --> 01:07:27.286]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[01:07:27.426 --> 01:07:31.308]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[01:07:31.628 --> 01:07:36.671]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[01:07:36.951 --> 01:07:37.852]  Not our iodine.
[01:07:37.972 --> 01:07:44.135]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to be completely pure.
[01:07:44.315 --> 01:07:46.236]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today.
[01:07:46.356 --> 01:07:47.697]  See the informational videos.

[01:08:08.686 --> 01:08:15.751]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:08:15.851 --> 01:08:18.013]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:08:18.193 --> 01:08:23.297]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:08:23.477 --> 01:08:28.481]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:08:28.641 --> 01:08:31.683]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:08:31.963 --> 01:08:35.824]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:08:36.024 --> 01:08:40.284]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:08:40.344 --> 01:08:50.386]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:08:50.586 --> 01:09:01.348]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:09:01.488 --> 01:09:06.896]  Now available exclusively at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:09:06.956 --> 01:09:13.545]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:09:14.106 --> 01:09:16.890]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:09:32.901 --> 01:09:33.281]  We're back.
[01:09:33.321 --> 01:09:34.902]  We're broadcasting worldwide.
[01:09:35.102 --> 01:09:36.603]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:09:39.165 --> 01:09:43.368]  If you just joined us, I'm going to recap and then go to your phone calls.
[01:09:44.849 --> 01:09:47.971]  This is probably one of the most important broadcasts I've ever done.
[01:09:47.991 --> 01:09:59.838]  A little more on a week ago, a very successful medical doctor that I know that manages a group of hospitals.
[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:02.260]  Big ones.
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:26.298]  In a major city in Texas, told one of my associates, that had first introduced me to this gentleman about a year ago, that there are people that have Ebola-like symptoms, bleeding out of every orifice, in hospitals, in major Texas cities, that are being disappeared.
[01:10:27.844 --> 01:10:31.005]  The Feds show up, there's no record, they just whisk them away.
[01:10:31.225 --> 01:10:34.926]  Which the hospitals aren't supposed to do, that's violation of federal and state law.
[01:10:35.786 --> 01:10:38.307]  And there's not even a record in the hospital, it's expunged.
[01:10:42.048 --> 01:10:52.091]  I then had a chance to talk to this individual about it, and then I reached out to some other medical doctors and people and they said, yes, that's what's going on, and they even named some of the hospitals.
[01:10:53.894 --> 01:11:02.418]  All of them said, don't say what city I'm in and don't say my name or they'll pull my license or worse, but you should be scared, you should get your family ready.
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:13.804]  Well, Anthony Gucciardi talked about this yesterday when he was on In This Hour with David Knight.
[01:11:17.605 --> 01:11:20.507]  Well, I've been busy behind the scenes trying to research all this.
[01:11:20.527 --> 01:11:22.348]  I mean, this is big news, folks.
[01:11:22.368 --> 01:11:22.668]  This is
[01:11:23.615 --> 01:11:26.556]  This is the type of stuff that makes you get sick at your stomach.
[01:11:27.977 --> 01:11:30.898]  I don't mean that as a double entendre that a bulldog gives you a stomachache.
[01:11:30.938 --> 01:11:40.342]  I mean, I've... I don't get anxiety when ten cops, you know, jump out of a van and run up and say they're going to arrest me in New York because I'm covering a demonstration and threatening to beat my brains in.
[01:11:40.562 --> 01:11:42.763]  And I've been arrested, you know, repeatedly in New York.
[01:11:43.473 --> 01:11:44.533]  I'm not saying I'm a tough guy.
[01:11:44.633 --> 01:11:48.835]  You've seen footage of troops jumping out of a vehicle and running up with guns saying, turn your cameras off.
[01:11:48.875 --> 01:11:49.835]  And I tell them I'm not going to.
[01:11:49.975 --> 01:11:56.917]  I mean, I just, I don't have anxiety and I've been to the point of basically throwing up from anxiety.
[01:11:57.417 --> 01:11:58.838]  That's how real this is.
[01:11:58.978 --> 01:11:59.258]  Okay.
[01:11:59.918 --> 01:12:02.279]  Because it's not just that I'm scared of Ebola and have three children.
[01:12:03.419 --> 01:12:05.800]  It gets you real deep when you got little kids and this is going on.
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:08.020]  Why would the government bring in more flights?
[01:12:08.221 --> 01:12:09.521]  Why are they covering things up?
[01:12:10.888 --> 01:12:12.188]  It's not just to stop a panic.
[01:12:12.228 --> 01:12:15.069]  They want to get it going before the big panic sets in.
[01:12:15.289 --> 01:12:18.210]  They've done everything they can to cause the maximum disaster.
[01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:31.833]  And then, Dr. James Lorenzi, who works at Cass Regional Medical Center, we called him yesterday, called him today, confirmed, called him there at his offices.
[01:12:32.353 --> 01:12:33.193]  He was just on with us.
[01:12:33.573 --> 01:12:34.354]  We called and got him.
[01:12:34.374 --> 01:12:35.274]  You know, get us Dr.
[01:12:36.704 --> 01:12:37.385]  Lorenzi on.
[01:12:37.505 --> 01:12:38.165]  They go and get him.
[01:12:38.205 --> 01:12:39.306]  That's how we document things.
[01:12:39.326 --> 01:12:42.849]  We don't just... We got a federal marshal whistleblower.
[01:12:45.671 --> 01:12:48.673]  It's a little different because you can't call up and say, is this your federal marshal?
[01:12:48.974 --> 01:12:56.800]  You just have to ferret around and check it and then confirm it and call the numbers on the documents and get threatened by the feds that you have secret documents and, you know, why do you have those?
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:58.141]  Give those to us right now.
[01:12:58.161 --> 01:13:01.503]  I mean, that's... you have to vet things as a journalist.
[01:13:02.104 --> 01:13:05.907]  We vetted him and I got a sick feeling when we called the hospital and got him on the line.
[01:13:10.342 --> 01:13:11.623]  And he knew we were going to call and do that.
[01:13:11.643 --> 01:13:15.706]  A lot of times we have whistleblowers send us their military IDs, you name it.
[01:13:15.826 --> 01:13:22.110]  And it's gotten to the point where they have to mail them to us now because they'll intercept them on the internet and then go harass them, or worse.
[01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:23.091]  This is serious.
[01:13:23.111 --> 01:13:34.699]  It's like Matt Drudge said a few years ago, you gotta now meet your sources like Deep Throat from the whole Watergate situation with Nixon in parking garages.
[01:13:35.619 --> 01:13:37.701]  I actually meet people in parking garages.
[01:13:40.356 --> 01:13:41.196]  You know why they do that?
[01:13:41.236 --> 01:13:43.357]  Because they don't have GPS into a parking garage.
[01:13:43.377 --> 01:13:45.337]  It doesn't shoot through the concrete.
[01:13:47.217 --> 01:13:52.838]  In the old days, you just met in a parking garage because it was a place where you couldn't be seen by satellite, where your cars were parked by each other.
[01:13:54.979 --> 01:13:58.339]  So, I'm living in the middle of a spy movie, and you are too.
[01:13:58.559 --> 01:14:00.300]  I mean, this is really going on.
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:02.120]  This is really happening.
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:07.101]  And if you're not concerned and freaked out, something's wrong with you.
[01:14:08.877 --> 01:14:15.979]  So we're opening the phones up to medical workers, medical doctors, you name it, to talk about what Dr. James Lorenzi told us.
[01:14:16.239 --> 01:14:26.203]  And he named the medical centers, he named what's happening, and how people are being disappeared by the feds that come in and grab them and wheel them off.
[01:14:26.909 --> 01:14:33.672]  That's exactly what the head of the retiree Border Patrol Union said when we talked to senior Border Patrol and ICE officials.
[01:14:34.032 --> 01:14:37.033]  And they said, we've seen this, but Zach Taylor's retired.
[01:14:37.113 --> 01:14:38.014]  You can talk to him.
[01:14:38.494 --> 01:14:40.875]  He's who we give the intel to, basically.
[01:14:42.555 --> 01:14:43.916]  And so we got Zach Taylor on.
[01:14:43.936 --> 01:14:45.136]  He said, yeah, no, they got vans.
[01:14:45.157 --> 01:14:45.837]  They're grabbing people.
[01:14:46.604 --> 01:14:48.006]  That was October 10th.
[01:14:48.046 --> 01:14:49.668]  So you understand, this is confirmed, basically.
[01:14:49.968 --> 01:14:53.332]  The reason I'm freaked out at this point, it's pretty much confirmed.
[01:14:53.673 --> 01:14:59.359]  There's a hope and a prayer that there's something else making people bleed out, but why would the feds be covering it up?
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:14:59.800]  Okay?
[01:15:00.441 --> 01:15:01.222]  That's all I can say.
[01:15:04.025 --> 01:15:05.686]  Louise is a dental assistant.
[01:15:05.706 --> 01:15:06.606]  Let's talk about Ebola.
[01:15:06.626 --> 01:15:07.666]  Yeah, that's folks that would see it.
[01:15:08.386 --> 01:15:11.688]  Sue's in Missouri, medical technologist.
[01:15:11.808 --> 01:15:12.668]  That's all the equipment.
[01:15:13.228 --> 01:15:15.209]  Steve's in Mass, staff nurse at a hospital.
[01:15:15.589 --> 01:15:17.530]  Sarah's in Texas, friend works for a hospital.
[01:15:18.150 --> 01:15:19.290]  So we'll go just in order.
[01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:20.731]  Sue in Missouri, thanks for calling.
[01:15:20.751 --> 01:15:22.791]  Do you have any information for us?
[01:15:22.811 --> 01:15:27.193]  First of all, I just want to say thank you, Alex, and your team.
[01:15:27.233 --> 01:15:28.353]  You're doing a great job.
[01:15:28.733 --> 01:15:32.515]  I just wish that I could get more people to listen.
[01:15:35.898 --> 01:15:44.725]  The thought that they're pulling the protective equipment, you know, not letting people get the protective equipment.
[01:15:46.006 --> 01:15:51.030]  My idea about that is, okay, what's the bottom line?
[01:15:52.211 --> 01:15:53.472]  Usually, what's the bottom line?
[01:15:53.512 --> 01:15:54.193]  It's the dollar.
[01:15:54.813 --> 01:15:58.376]  Okay, what do they have out there in the wings that they want to give to everybody?
[01:15:59.597 --> 01:16:03.520]  Okay, so if they take the protective equipment away from the medical workers,
[01:16:04.198 --> 01:16:07.099]  What's their next line of defense?
[01:16:07.119 --> 01:16:20.761]  By the way, he mentions the Hospital Corporation of America, which is the biggest hospital chain, and my dad's even done work with them, and is a medical consultant, and he said they're taking their gear away.
[01:16:21.521 --> 01:16:22.901]  So it's, quote, all equal.
[01:16:23.161 --> 01:16:24.501]  No, it's so they don't create a panic.
[01:16:24.761 --> 01:16:27.222]  Well, that's criminal to take the gear away.
[01:16:27.262 --> 01:16:29.002]  I mean, that's like taking cops' guns away.
[01:16:29.062 --> 01:16:30.522]  This is insane.
[01:16:30.542 --> 01:16:33.483]  I want the people to say, give me the vaccine.
[01:16:35.674 --> 01:16:40.615]  So if the medical workers take the vaccine, then the rest of the people are going to think the vaccine is okay to take.
[01:16:42.355 --> 01:16:48.196]  I think they're doing it because they want people, they're going to make the nurses and the doctors take the damn vaccine.
[01:16:48.376 --> 01:16:48.856]  Oh, that's it.
[01:16:48.896 --> 01:16:49.816]  Just like with flu.
[01:16:49.836 --> 01:16:51.397]  They take it.
[01:16:51.737 --> 01:16:53.117]  They're taking their equipment away.
[01:16:53.217 --> 01:16:56.558]  So now we know we have no protection when we go to a patient's room.
[01:16:57.778 --> 01:16:58.978]  Or we have no protection.
[01:16:59.018 --> 01:17:03.159]  I work in the laboratory, so we have no protection when we work in the lab.
[01:17:06.098 --> 01:17:10.522]  I think they're taking it away because the next thing the nurses will have to do is what?
[01:17:10.542 --> 01:17:11.483]  Give me the vaccine!
[01:17:12.384 --> 01:17:13.104]  Very well said.
[01:17:13.124 --> 01:17:13.705]  Thank you, Sue.
[01:17:13.725 --> 01:17:17.488]  We'll see if we can get any intel from Steve in Mass, staff nurse at a hospital.
[01:17:17.508 --> 01:17:19.230]  Steve, do you have any information on this?
[01:17:20.511 --> 01:17:21.372]  Hi, can you hear me, Alex?
[01:17:21.412 --> 01:17:21.772]  Yes, sir.
[01:17:21.792 --> 01:17:23.694]  Hi, Alex.
[01:17:23.874 --> 01:17:25.875]  I've been a registered nurse for about seven years.
[01:17:26.676 --> 01:17:28.538]  My wife's also a nurse here in Massachusetts.
[01:17:29.318 --> 01:17:31.621]  And if this thing gets here, I mean, it's going to be a nightmare.
[01:17:31.841 --> 01:17:33.062]  You know, you have people waiting.
[01:17:33.989 --> 01:17:38.393]  12 hours in the emergency room piled on top of each other before they can even see a doctor.
[01:17:38.413 --> 01:17:44.177]  You know, that's plenty of time for the Ebola to spread or, you know, jump patients to patients or patients to nurses.
[01:17:44.597 --> 01:17:48.440]  That's what they say is the waiting room is the most dangerous place in America right now.
[01:17:49.381 --> 01:17:52.103]  Yes, and there's, you know, there's maybe three negative pressure rooms.
[01:17:53.132 --> 01:17:55.274]  Um, maybe in each emergency room.
[01:17:56.034 --> 01:18:00.998]  Um, and what the first caller said about the flu shot, what I would encourage all healthcare workers to do is refuse it.
[01:18:01.538 --> 01:18:05.841]  Then they'll make you wear a mask and, you know, probably be safer than taking the flu vaccine anyway.
[01:18:07.923 --> 01:18:12.386]  Do you have any information on what this doctor said earlier and what the medical doctors I've talked to are saying?
[01:18:12.406 --> 01:18:21.993]  Uh, I do know that they have started training in one out of the seven hospitals for Ebola, but it was merely a 15-minute in-service where they put a mask on and some gowns.
[01:18:22.614 --> 01:18:24.441]  No protective equipment for the eyes.
[01:18:25.866 --> 01:18:27.832]  Like someone said the other week, the N95.
[01:18:29.224 --> 01:18:36.626]  Isn't the appropriate match for Ebola that you need something bigger like the N-100, and I encourage all healthcare workers to buy it for themselves and use it at work.
[01:18:36.746 --> 01:18:37.206]  Exactly.
[01:18:37.246 --> 01:18:38.046]  Thank you so much.
[01:18:38.646 --> 01:18:43.908]  Bobby's a New York City firefighter, and that's in the New York Post and the New York Times.
[01:18:43.928 --> 01:18:51.209]  They've been told, do not use the word Ebola over your radio, so that's evidence of the pre-preparation for cover-up.
[01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:52.710]  What's your information, Bobby?
[01:18:52.750 --> 01:18:53.390]  Thanks for calling.
[01:18:54.290 --> 01:18:54.710]  Hey, Alex.
[01:18:54.730 --> 01:18:55.410]  How you doing, man?
[01:18:55.450 --> 01:18:56.391]  Long time listener.
[01:18:56.431 --> 01:18:57.091]  First time caller.
[01:18:59.219 --> 01:19:01.381]  To be honest with you, I work in the Bronx.
[01:19:01.581 --> 01:19:03.263]  I haven't really heard anything about that.
[01:19:03.443 --> 01:19:05.945]  Maybe the dispatches have gotten that information?
[01:19:06.185 --> 01:19:06.545]  Sure.
[01:19:06.585 --> 01:19:11.409]  Because we get very limited information at the firehouse, so to speak.
[01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:16.414]  But, I mean, other than that, we haven't heard any information about that.
[01:19:16.994 --> 01:19:17.194]  Sure.
[01:19:17.214 --> 01:19:18.816]  Well, we just put the New York Post up on screen.
[01:19:18.876 --> 01:19:19.977]  What's your take on all this?
[01:19:21.358 --> 01:19:27.343]  Well, I could tell you at the firehouse level, we barely have any information about Ebola.
[01:19:28.288 --> 01:19:38.334]  I mean, they give us these baseline suits, which basically are just for like projectile vomit.
[01:19:38.354 --> 01:19:40.415]  Very often we do CPR and such.
[01:19:41.976 --> 01:19:45.178]  But as far as Ebola goes, no, we're not equipped at all.
[01:19:45.218 --> 01:19:46.479]  There's no question we're not equipped.
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:51.782]  What did you think of what Dr. James Lorenzi was saying earlier?
[01:19:52.921 --> 01:19:59.026]  Honestly, I missed most of that interview, but I'm sure it's par for the course of what he was saying.
[01:20:00.247 --> 01:20:10.817]  He was naming the hospital where they have people that look like they're dying of Ebola being disappeared by the feds, and he's talked to other doctors and they say it's going on in other areas, and I know a major doctor in Texas saying the same thing.
[01:20:12.045 --> 01:20:16.829]  Yeah, I mean, we're walking into stuff where, like, we don't even know what we're getting involved in.
[01:20:16.849 --> 01:20:21.612]  Like, we get a ticket at the firehouse, which is the, you know, the call.
[01:20:21.953 --> 01:20:28.698]  You know, someone calls 9-1-1, and we get a ticket at the firehouse, and we barely even know what we're getting into.
[01:20:28.718 --> 01:20:33.702]  They have this system implemented, it's called UCT, Unified Call Taker.
[01:20:33.722 --> 01:20:35.964]  It's just basic information.
[01:20:36.224 --> 01:20:37.405]  We don't even know what we're getting into.
[01:20:38.339 --> 01:20:48.285]  Yeah, I've read that a lot of these centralized homeland security code systems now are not allowing real communication because it dumbs down the communication and takes the local control away.
[01:20:48.305 --> 01:20:49.425]  Never a good idea in my view.
[01:20:49.685 --> 01:20:50.286]  Thank you, Bobby.
[01:20:50.326 --> 01:20:51.006]  Be safe up there.
[01:20:51.026 --> 01:20:56.429]  Remember the deadly dust and the firefighters and they said it was safe to breathe when their internal documents said it was deadly.
[01:20:56.789 --> 01:21:06.555]  Louise, Jeff, Joe, Sarah, your calls are all coming up straight ahead and you can all email us at whistleblowers at infowars.com.

[01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:43.921]  Civil unrest, riots, looting.
[01:21:44.081 --> 01:21:46.242]  It's happening now, right here in the United States.
[01:21:46.562 --> 01:21:47.882]  And your rights are at risk.
[01:21:48.162 --> 01:21:52.264]  If passed, HR 5344 would ban Level 3 and above body armor.
[01:21:52.524 --> 01:21:54.465]  KD Armor is standing up for you.

[01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:12.972]  On September 30th, 2014, the first confirmed case of Ebola appeared in the U.S.
[01:22:13.292 --> 01:22:25.296]  This combined with several other unidentified viruses have some of our customers at 30dayfoodsupply.com concerned about the safety of our domestic food supply, resulting in a surge of our $99.90 serving kits.

[01:25:41.588 --> 01:25:43.469]  When the man comes around.
[01:25:44.428 --> 01:25:48.750]  Alright, we've got a police officer, Corey, who's an EMT police officer in Wisconsin.
[01:25:48.770 --> 01:25:52.831]  We've got Sarah, who's got a friend who works at a hospital that told her some info that's very cryptic.
[01:25:53.351 --> 01:25:56.152]  We've got Luis, a dental assistant, has info.
[01:25:56.192 --> 01:25:57.693]  Jeff in Indiana is a firefighter.
[01:25:58.153 --> 01:25:58.993]  I want to get to everybody.
[01:25:59.033 --> 01:26:01.334]  We have Harry Dent coming on, but we'll get to you as well.
[01:26:01.974 --> 01:26:04.095]  Let's move quickly through these calls.
[01:26:04.475 --> 01:26:06.256]  Sarah in Texas, tell us your information.
[01:26:06.296 --> 01:26:06.616]  Thank you.
[01:26:07.996 --> 01:26:09.237]  Hi Alex, can you hear me?
[01:26:09.297 --> 01:26:09.737]  Yes, I can.
[01:26:11.016 --> 01:26:12.777]  Okay, sorry, I'm nervous.
[01:26:12.817 --> 01:26:13.978]  I've never been on the radio before.
[01:26:13.998 --> 01:26:14.799]  No, thank you for calling.
[01:26:14.839 --> 01:26:15.179]  Go ahead.
[01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:25.687]  Okay, so I have a friend who works at a very big hospital in, like, northern Dallas,
[01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:30.600]  Yeah, sorry.
[01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:35.981]  I don't really want to give out any information because I'm not supposed to talk about it, but... Well, listen, if you're not the actual person, it's okay.
[01:26:36.001 --> 01:26:37.281]  Just tell us what you... We need to know.
[01:26:37.301 --> 01:26:39.482]  We need to be scared of this Ebola getting out of hand.
[01:26:39.842 --> 01:26:42.322]  Not of... I mean, if you don't actually work there, there's not much they can do.
[01:26:42.582 --> 01:26:43.863]  Just tell us what they told you, please.
[01:26:45.643 --> 01:26:57.305]  Basically, this happened maybe about three or four weeks ago in this hospital that somebody came in there with Ebola-like symptoms, but basically, what it boiled down to is that they were
[01:27:07.892 --> 01:27:10.855]  That's what the major Texas City doctor told me.
[01:27:10.875 --> 01:27:15.198]  I just want to give out the info and I'm sworn to shut up.
[01:27:15.658 --> 01:27:20.102]  And then the other fellow who confirmed his identity up in Missouri, that's what they're being told.
[01:27:20.242 --> 01:27:24.225]  And the doctors are all, malaria doesn't make you bleed out of your eyeballs in your rear end.
[01:27:25.407 --> 01:27:27.768]  Malaria makes you get the chills and shrivel up and lose weight.
[01:27:28.268 --> 01:27:29.309]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:27:29.529 --> 01:27:33.051]  So that's what they told you, was that they thought something was going on?
[01:27:34.411 --> 01:27:36.852]  Yes, and they thought that was weird.
[01:27:38.053 --> 01:27:43.895]  You know, also what everybody else has been saying about the doctors losing their protective gear and stuff.
[01:27:44.276 --> 01:27:50.438]  Well, nobody ever talks about the people that have to go in and clean up after these patients, like in the ER.
[01:27:50.458 --> 01:27:51.679]  You know what I mean?
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:54.520]  Sure, sure.
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:28:02.464]  I mean, the janitorial service with one Ebola patient in Dallas, they had bloody bandages and stuff, quote, piled to the ceiling.
[01:28:02.864 --> 01:28:03.424]  God bless you.
[01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:04.224]  Thank you for the call.
[01:28:04.705 --> 01:28:10.527]  Joe in Texas, who's a medical worker, listening on KDAV, 1590 AM.
[01:28:11.467 --> 01:28:11.927]  Go ahead.
[01:28:12.128 --> 01:28:13.088]  Welcome to the airwaves.
[01:28:14.469 --> 01:28:17.210]  Yes, I will try to make this as brief as possible.
[01:28:17.690 --> 01:28:19.791]  However, I'm not sure if I can.
[01:28:20.011 --> 01:28:22.712]  The point I wanted to make, though, is
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:42.169]  Big Pharmacy cannot do a double-blind study on an Ebola treatment, so they're working in conjunction with the CDC to spread this as wide as possible before true panic instills the country, and then they can actually test their treatments.
[01:28:43.429 --> 01:28:46.651]  It's all the dollar signs with the government and Big Pharmacy.
[01:28:48.015 --> 01:28:56.362]  Well, that's for sure that they stand to gain from it, but they must think we're dumb if this gets out of hand and they let it happen.
[01:28:56.422 --> 01:29:00.025]  I mean, they just must think they're above the law and totally invincible.
[01:29:00.265 --> 01:29:01.946]  Folks are going to be mad when kids are dead.
[01:29:02.487 --> 01:29:03.748]  I'm telling you, I've had enough of this.
[01:29:04.789 --> 01:29:12.155]  Trying to downplay as much as possible so that people will continue with their normal lives and be carriers.
[01:29:12.719 --> 01:29:17.060]  And spread it so they can actually do a true study on a treatment.
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:18.621]  And where are you specifically?
[01:29:18.641 --> 01:29:20.341]  I mean, I know the station you're calling from, but where are you?
[01:29:21.941 --> 01:29:24.542]  I am currently in Lubbock, Texas.
[01:29:25.402 --> 01:29:27.223]  And what are the other medical workers you talk to?
[01:29:27.263 --> 01:29:30.504]  I mean, do they agree with you or what's their take?
[01:29:30.804 --> 01:29:36.085]  They are terrified that the CDC is kind of blowing this off.
[01:29:37.652 --> 01:29:38.172]  In the country.
[01:29:38.192 --> 01:29:48.937]  They're taking it seriously in Africa, but they're not protecting our own citizens because they want to do their government's bidding.
[01:29:48.977 --> 01:29:51.138]  They want to bring this country down and make a bunch of money, yeah.
[01:29:51.778 --> 01:29:51.938]  Yeah.
[01:29:52.578 --> 01:29:52.758]  Yes.
[01:29:54.579 --> 01:29:55.379]  I am so sick of it.
[01:29:55.399 --> 01:29:56.200]  Well, God bless you.
[01:29:56.220 --> 01:29:57.420]  Thank you for the call.
[01:29:57.740 --> 01:30:00.001]  Corey in Wisconsin, a police officer.
[01:30:00.161 --> 01:30:00.781]  Got about a minute.
[01:30:00.802 --> 01:30:01.382]  Thanks for calling.
[01:30:01.402 --> 01:30:01.682]  Go ahead.
[01:30:03.371 --> 01:30:12.418]  Alex, hey, I'm just calling to confirm the earlier reports that you had about how we're dispatched to a call, whether it's possibly Ebola, that they do not want to say Ebola over the air.
[01:30:13.078 --> 01:30:21.665]  And they will say for our agency, quote, they have positive answers to additional screening questions, which our dispatchers ask to the patient.
[01:30:22.806 --> 01:30:24.287]  They have positive answers.
[01:30:25.888 --> 01:30:27.009]  What do they say exactly again?
[01:30:27.850 --> 01:30:32.993]  Yeah, our dispatcher will ask the person, do you have a fever greater than 100.4 Fahrenheit?
[01:30:33.053 --> 01:30:36.815]  Do you have severe headaches, unexplained bleeding?
[01:30:36.875 --> 01:30:47.280]  If they answer yes to those questions, and they ask if they've been to West Africa, Guinea, Liberia, and if they've had contact with... You know, we got... We have Harry Dent coming on, but we'll keep him in until the next hour.
[01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:47.820]  Stay there, sir.
[01:30:49.594 --> 01:30:51.436]  Corey, Officer Corey, don't hang up.
[01:30:51.456 --> 01:30:53.658]  I want to come back and let you finish up for a minute or so.
[01:30:53.678 --> 01:30:54.760]  This is key information.
[01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:56.942]  Confirming what the New York Post reported.
[01:30:56.982 --> 01:30:57.562]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:57.582 --> 01:30:57.963]  Stay with us.
[01:30:58.884 --> 01:30:59.765]  We're on the march.
[01:31:00.285 --> 01:31:01.887]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:31:02.808 --> 01:31:05.491]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:31:09.614 --> 01:31:11.235]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[01:31:11.555 --> 01:31:15.336]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[01:31:16.076 --> 01:31:20.417]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[01:31:20.537 --> 01:31:27.339]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[01:31:27.859 --> 01:31:36.922]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:37.142 --> 01:31:42.544]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[01:31:42.684 --> 01:31:49.948]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.
[01:31:50.288 --> 01:31:52.569]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:31:52.849 --> 01:31:57.931]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.

[01:32:03.278 --> 01:32:04.300]  DNA Force from InfoWarsLife.
[01:32:09.793 --> 01:32:19.319]  Using unparalleled research and the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:32:19.459 --> 01:32:29.204]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:32:29.384 --> 01:32:32.306]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body.
[01:32:32.506 --> 01:32:33.127]  I think so.
[01:32:47.483 --> 01:32:47.723]  We're good.
[01:33:10.862 --> 01:33:11.922]  In the near future.
[01:33:12.202 --> 01:33:16.343]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:33:16.703 --> 01:33:17.703]  Security alert.
[01:33:17.923 --> 01:33:19.664]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:33:19.944 --> 01:33:20.564]  Analysis.
[01:33:20.804 --> 01:33:23.485]  InfoWars building independent media operations.
[01:33:23.505 --> 01:33:28.486]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:33:28.526 --> 01:33:29.446]  Prime Directive.
[01:33:29.546 --> 01:33:31.026]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:33:31.086 --> 01:33:33.867]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:33:33.947 --> 01:33:37.027]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:33:37.188 --> 01:33:39.348]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:33:39.668 --> 01:33:40.989]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:33:41.009 --> 01:33:43.351]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:33:43.831 --> 01:33:45.512]  They are never going to stop.
[01:33:45.793 --> 01:33:49.716]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:33:49.836 --> 01:33:53.058]  Block free iPhone ads at InfoWars.com.
[01:33:53.438 --> 01:33:56.100]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[01:33:56.801 --> 01:33:57.522]  Imperative.
[01:33:57.782 --> 01:33:59.783]  Destroy 30-minute TV.
[01:33:59.823 --> 01:34:04.207]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:34:04.227 --> 01:34:06.628]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[01:34:19.329 --> 01:34:23.492]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:34:24.233 --> 01:34:26.154]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:34:28.196 --> 01:34:36.622]  If you just joined us, normally I would cancel all the guests on a day with something this important happening, but I didn't cancel Harry Dent.
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:43.361]  Because he's making a lot of accurate predictions on the economy and what would start happening to the stock market.
[01:34:43.821 --> 01:34:51.083]  He was on with us just a few months ago and predicted that it would start going down and he predicted some other things that are starting to unfold.
[01:34:51.523 --> 01:34:52.643]  So I wanted to get him on.
[01:34:52.683 --> 01:35:07.006]  We moved him up 30 minutes or back 30 minutes because obviously I've talked to a major medical doctor who I know personally who manages a very large hospital and a group of hospitals who said
[01:35:08.237 --> 01:35:15.062]  They're definitely disappearing people that are bleeding out, we believe with Ebola, and the feds are coming and taking them away.
[01:35:15.522 --> 01:35:26.210]  We then interviewed last week confirming this, Agent Zach Taylor, former deputy head of the Border Patrol, now the head of their union, and he said this has been going on for months on the southern border.
[01:35:29.172 --> 01:35:31.533]  So, very, very suspicious.
[01:35:31.553 --> 01:35:36.437]  Then, Dr. James Larazzini,
[01:35:39.145 --> 01:35:43.308]  At Cache Regional Medical Center in Garden City, Missouri contacted us.
[01:35:43.749 --> 01:35:46.371]  We contacted him back, called him, got him on at the hospital.
[01:35:47.131 --> 01:35:49.333]  Had him on via his cell phone after that.
[01:35:50.274 --> 01:35:50.894]  Last hour.
[01:35:53.116 --> 01:35:58.180]  Naming the medical centers, naming where people are bleeding out, and then they're just disappeared by the feds.
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:35:59.181]  Nothing is signed out.
[01:35:59.761 --> 01:36:00.382]  It's incredible.
[01:36:00.922 --> 01:36:03.504]  And they're basically threatening people not to talk about it.
[01:36:03.524 --> 01:36:05.286]  We've had police officers call in and confirm it.
[01:36:06.451 --> 01:36:13.016]  It's been in the New York Post, you name it, that they're telling firefighters and police, don't use on the dispatch the word Ebola.
[01:36:13.397 --> 01:36:16.879]  And then we have a police officer, Cory in Wisconsin, who got cut off by the brake.
[01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:26.907]  Spend a minute, sir, just recap, you're an EMT slash police officer, what you're being told, what they're saying, what the codes are, and what their reasons are for that.
[01:36:26.988 --> 01:36:27.288]  Please, sir.
[01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:41.941]  Yeah, Alex, we got a memo about a week ago stating that if we are dispatched to somebody who has a fever, the dispatcher will ask questions specifically if they've been to Africa or West Africa, if they have a fever over 104, things like that.
[01:36:41.981 --> 01:36:49.507]  If those questions are answered yes, we will then be dispatched along with the ALS, which is Advanced Life Support Unit, along with the battalion.
[01:36:51.068 --> 01:36:51.709]  Okay, cool.
[01:36:52.726 --> 01:36:59.188]  Um, we have positive answers to additional screening questions, which is code for possible Ebola.
[01:36:59.648 --> 01:37:08.390]  At that point, our police department has said that we will not enter the scene, and the fire department itself has told us that they may not even enter the scene as well.
[01:37:09.050 --> 01:37:17.712]  As far as what happens after that, I'm not sure, but we do have instructions to call the health department, and I'm sure they would be in contact with the CDC then.
[01:37:20.083 --> 01:37:23.547]  What about the ethical issues of vans pulling up and disappearing people?
[01:37:23.587 --> 01:37:24.648]  They should just be honest.
[01:37:25.249 --> 01:37:28.792]  And they should be quarantined in military facilities that are designed for this.
[01:37:29.053 --> 01:37:30.614]  That's why we paid for them and built them.
[01:37:31.767 --> 01:37:34.228]  Why cover up that the disappearances are going on?
[01:37:34.748 --> 01:37:39.929]  We've now confirmed this in triplicate with doctors and border patrol people by name.
[01:37:39.969 --> 01:37:40.909]  This is now confirmed.
[01:37:41.749 --> 01:37:47.191]  Because my concern is it sets up the infrastructure to expand this to political people and other things.
[01:37:47.251 --> 01:37:53.032]  If you can get government to cover up disappearing medical people for medical issues, then you can do anything in my view.
[01:37:54.653 --> 01:37:54.833]  Sure.
[01:37:55.013 --> 01:37:56.153]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:37:57.029 --> 01:38:00.872]  As far as equipment, equipping us, the police department, we have no equipment.
[01:38:01.312 --> 01:38:06.975]  The fire department has no specific equipment that would be effective against Ebola.
[01:38:09.557 --> 01:38:11.879]  Well, it's getting out of hand, and there's clearly a cover-up.
[01:38:11.939 --> 01:38:14.400]  I just pray it's not as bad as it looks.
[01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:16.461]  What does your gut tell you is going on?
[01:38:18.323 --> 01:38:22.285]  Well, I think it might be an epidemic.
[01:38:23.406 --> 01:38:24.987]  I have a chance to
[01:38:25.822 --> 01:38:28.743]  Interacts with illegal immigrants all the time.
[01:38:29.624 --> 01:38:32.405]  I work in a small village, and I still encounter them all the time.
[01:38:33.326 --> 01:38:50.854]  And I think, with the borders being open, as they are, this is... They don't want it to get out that it probably is more widespread than it is, because it can be tied to illegal immigration, just like the virus that the school kids are getting, and it's tied to Latin American countries, as well.
[01:38:51.874 --> 01:38:52.514]  Yep, that's it.
[01:38:52.575 --> 01:38:56.697]  Total political correctness, and then they get to implode the country and make billions off the vaccines.
[01:38:56.998 --> 01:38:57.898]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:38:57.918 --> 01:38:58.799]  Thank you for the information.
[01:38:59.419 --> 01:39:04.083]  Okay, we're going to go to our guest here for 30 minutes in the next hour, then I will continue with your calls.
[01:39:04.463 --> 01:39:14.010]  And we have a reporter joining us from Ottawa, Dan Dix of his organization up there, Press for Truth, is going to be joining us as well at the bottom of the next hour.
[01:39:15.286 --> 01:39:25.935]  Briefly, what I'm personally doing to boost my immune system is Survival Shield X2, nascent iodine that I believe from the research we've done is just as important as colloidal silver and other things.
[01:39:26.556 --> 01:39:30.299]  Also, super male vitality, super female vitality, lung cleanse.
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:31.741]  70% of the immune system is in the gut.
[01:39:32.884 --> 01:39:41.389]  The OxyPowder DNA Force does stuff above and beyond vitamin C and with the Bio PQQ and the CoQ10 organic sources of that.
[01:39:41.769 --> 01:39:44.190]  It is a nutraceutical of the highest quality.
[01:39:44.230 --> 01:39:45.511]  It's all available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:39:48.337 --> 01:40:04.952]  I've been saying for six months boost your immune system going into this winter because I lost three family members this last year into this year December January were hellish times and I have a lot of family in the medical field they just say it's unbelievable what the MRSA and stuff's doing so bottom line I would try to abuse
[01:40:06.013 --> 01:40:10.618]  As much as you can, boost your immune system, boost your body's natural defenses.
[01:40:10.658 --> 01:40:11.679]  That's what I'm personally doing.
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:16.825]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:40:17.545 --> 01:40:23.512]  And you don't just get the highest quality supplements out there, you support the tip of the spear in the information war.
[01:40:23.852 --> 01:40:24.072]  So 888-253-3139.
[01:40:29.037 --> 01:40:30.837]  And we've got Phil in Florida who's a physician.
[01:40:30.877 --> 01:40:32.198]  We'll get to you if you have to go.
[01:40:32.218 --> 01:40:35.218]  We can get your number and call you back when Mr. Dent leaves us.
[01:40:35.799 --> 01:40:37.779]  We've got Jeff in Indiana, firefighter.
[01:40:38.139 --> 01:40:41.240]  Tracy, we've got Ben who's an environmental health worker.
[01:40:41.260 --> 01:40:43.640]  We need to hear from you, so stay there if you can.
[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:46.501]  But our guest has got important info on the economy.
[01:40:46.941 --> 01:40:51.462]  What would Ebola affect the economy like as well?
[01:40:52.449 --> 01:40:59.633]  And we're joined by Harry Dent, author of The Demographic Cliff and editor of the free newsletter Economy and Markets.
[01:41:00.093 --> 01:41:06.797]  He's the founder of Vent Research and was formerly a top analyst at Bain Capital and ran a lot of major operations there.
[01:41:07.097 --> 01:41:08.538]  He's had a bunch of best-selling books.
[01:41:09.118 --> 01:41:14.341]  His first, a big best-seller, was The Great Boom Ahead, published in 92, which folks thought was crazy.
[01:41:15.201 --> 01:41:20.162]  He accurately forecasted the unanticipated boom of the 90s and the continued expansion in 2007.
[01:41:20.202 --> 01:41:26.424]  Then he predicted the 2008 collapse and harrydent.com is his website.
[01:41:26.784 --> 01:41:35.066]  If you go to harrydent.com forward slash Alex Jones, he did something nice, publishing some of his book that's been unpublished online just for our listeners.
[01:41:35.326 --> 01:41:37.907]  harrydent.com forward slash Alex Jones.
[01:41:37.927 --> 01:41:42.328]  He always sends us great graphs and documents to put on screen for TV viewers.
[01:41:42.688 --> 01:41:47.350]  So I'd encourage radio listeners to go to Infowars.com forward slash show to actually watch the feed.
[01:41:48.190 --> 01:41:54.472]  Or later you can always go to PrisonPlanet.tv as a subscriber and see the TV version simulcast of this transmission.
[01:41:54.932 --> 01:41:56.533]  Sorry to get you on late here today.
[01:41:57.013 --> 01:42:02.655]  We have medical doctors confirming to us that they're covering up what they believe to be Ebola and whisking him away.
[01:42:02.675 --> 01:42:05.936]  How would, in your view as an economist and an analyst,
[01:42:07.237 --> 01:42:13.886]  How would this affect things if they do cover up Ebola and there's even a moderate epidemic, a few thousand people that get it?
[01:42:14.667 --> 01:42:18.673]  I mean, looks to me like that would cause some major shockwaves in the economy.
[01:42:19.670 --> 01:42:35.747]  Well, you know, this recent mini crash, 10% down in the markets, was a combination of the Ebola news and Germany's economic minister standing up to Mario Draghi at the ECB in Europe and saying, no more QE.
[01:42:35.767 --> 01:42:36.587]  This is crazy.
[01:42:36.648 --> 01:42:38.529]  So the markets are not going to like this.
[01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:39.330]  I think they care more.
[01:42:40.351 --> 01:42:50.258]  About no more QE in Germany, but if Ebola gets any significant size, everybody knows this is exponential if it happens and we've seen epidemics like this before.
[01:42:50.278 --> 01:42:52.900]  There was a great one in the early 20s during a downturn.
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:43:01.847]  So, you know, at some point it could have a big impact and particularly if it's not known or covered up and then suddenly it's found out.
[01:43:01.947 --> 01:43:05.309]  So I mean, I'm definitely not an expert on that, but we do see it.
[01:43:05.329 --> 01:43:07.231]  We actually we just had a conference in Miami.
[01:43:08.354 --> 01:43:22.946]  And had a speaker from the Elliott Wave organization that said their their studies show that when stock markets peak and go down, as we're seeing, like, in the early thirties or the mid seventies or now, you usually do get.
[01:43:23.979 --> 01:43:28.523]  Things like epidemics and you get things, you know, weird weather like the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.
[01:43:28.563 --> 01:43:32.086]  So these things tend to happen together in cycles.
[01:43:32.106 --> 01:43:32.506]  That's right.
[01:43:32.526 --> 01:43:33.767]  You said this six months ago.
[01:43:33.787 --> 01:43:37.230]  You said epidemics and weird weather and people like, well, how is that explained?
[01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:37.750]  It's sun.
[01:43:37.851 --> 01:43:38.691]  It's sun cycles.
[01:43:39.712 --> 01:43:40.913]  Well, that's part of it, too.
[01:43:41.093 --> 01:43:45.337]  About every 10 years, our solar radiation peaks and then goes down.
[01:43:46.537 --> 01:44:02.410]  Um, for 5 to 6 years, and in those down cycles, you're more likely to see any type of thing from worsening weather, less rainfall, less sunshine, possibly epidemics, and all 88, I went back 190 years, 88% of substantial financial crises, crashes,
[01:44:08.834 --> 01:44:13.377]  Occur and major recessions occurred in this down solar spot cycle.
[01:44:13.437 --> 01:44:16.159]  So this is a very tangible cycle.
[01:44:16.838 --> 01:44:19.960]  That does have a tangible effect on the economy.
[01:44:20.401 --> 01:44:34.831]  We've just seen the most extended sunspot cycle in history, at least back to the 1700s, the last one, and now this cycle points down from 2014 into late 2019, early 2020.
[01:44:34.911 --> 01:44:37.552]  So this is saying we're going to have a financial crisis.
[01:44:37.572 --> 01:44:42.396]  If we're going to have anything major go wrong in the world, it's going to happen in the next five years.
[01:44:43.666 --> 01:44:51.116]  You've got a article up on your site right now, harrydent.com forward slash Alex Jones, says Dow 6000, are you prepared?
[01:44:51.617 --> 01:44:56.143]  Again, you were on with us about six months ago and predicted the stock market would start going down.
[01:44:56.764 --> 01:44:57.505]  It has done that.
[01:44:57.565 --> 01:44:59.968]  What is your latest analysis?
[01:45:00.709 --> 01:45:04.391]  Well, you know, we're in a, I think, a topping process here that could go either way.
[01:45:04.431 --> 01:45:11.716]  We've been saying, and you probably have this chart, megaphone pattern every bull market and bubble we've had.
[01:45:11.736 --> 01:45:16.298]  We've had bubble after bubble of stocks and commodities and everything, even real estate.
[01:45:16.678 --> 01:45:22.002]  But, you know, the first peak was 2000, the tech bubble, and then a big crash, and then a higher high in 2007, and then a bigger crash.
[01:45:24.623 --> 01:45:27.685]  And now we've got an even higher high, and that's the megaphone pattern.
[01:45:27.985 --> 01:45:33.509]  Each bubble takes us to new highs, but each crash afterwards takes us to even lower lows.
[01:45:33.549 --> 01:45:37.171]  So we've been predicting for the last year that the Dow would peak around 17,200 to 300.
[01:45:37.251 --> 01:45:37.891]  It actually hit 17,350.
[01:45:42.234 --> 01:45:52.204]  Not in September and then the next crash over a couple of years would take us probably around late 2016 give or take to around 5800 to 6000 on the Dow.
[01:45:52.624 --> 01:45:56.949]  That's a 65% crash and that wouldn't be the bottom, but that would be similar.
[01:45:57.629 --> 01:46:05.191]  To the worst crash we saw in the 1970s extended bear market when the last generation peaked in spending in 73 and 74.
[01:46:05.251 --> 01:46:07.471]  So we're looking for a big crash.
[01:46:07.931 --> 01:46:11.512]  My only question is, we told people, look, sell at $17,000, $200,000 to $300,000.
[01:46:12.252 --> 01:46:15.393]  The upside on this megaphone pattern is very, very limited.
[01:46:15.633 --> 01:46:17.814]  And the downside is very strong.
[01:46:17.854 --> 01:46:18.534]  You never know.
[01:46:19.369 --> 01:46:27.220]  There's going to be bad news about Ebola, or Germany, or China bubble bursting, all things we've been predicting would happen, and there's many other things.
[01:46:27.781 --> 01:46:29.403]  So the downside's much stronger.
[01:46:29.463 --> 01:46:30.685]  Now, what we had is two things.
[01:46:31.559 --> 01:46:41.607]  We had a key trend that would say, look, if we peaked over $17,000 and then broke below $16,500, that's a sign that the momentum's over.
[01:46:41.667 --> 01:46:48.413]  Well, we did that, but then the market turned around with the bulls jumping back in, and now it's gone back up.
[01:46:48.473 --> 01:46:54.358]  And we had what's called a confirmation rally just a couple days ago that said, you know,
[01:46:55.178 --> 01:47:05.847]  There's a chance we may make a slight new high, so I'd say it's about 50-50 that we made a top in September, or 50% chance that we'll see a top, but only slightly higher.
[01:47:05.907 --> 01:47:09.210]  I would estimate Dow 17,500 at the highest.
[01:47:09.530 --> 01:47:12.693]  So there's not much upside, and there's a whole lot of downside.
[01:47:12.713 --> 01:47:17.417]  This megaphone pattern was the same thing that happened when the last generation peaked.
[01:47:18.384 --> 01:47:32.288]  Between 1965 and 68, and then stimulus to follow, you saw a peak in 65, a crash, a peak in 68, higher, a bigger crash, and then the biggest crash came after the peak in late 72 into late 74 crash.
[01:47:32.328 --> 01:47:34.949]  So this megaphone pattern, very powerful.
[01:47:35.069 --> 01:47:38.350]  Economists are ignoring it because they're in denial about the bubble.
[01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:40.791]  All they do is say there is no bubble because of this.
[01:47:40.831 --> 01:47:41.611]  There is no bubble.
[01:47:41.671 --> 01:47:43.252]  Janet Yellen says there's no bubble.
[01:47:43.852 --> 01:47:44.953]  Mario Draghi.
[01:47:44.993 --> 01:48:04.011]  Meanwhile people like Donald Trump and John Williams of Shadow Stats and so many others are joining you saying get out this is going to be really big but but let's look at the megaphone chart for TV viewers I'll describe it for radio listeners and it shows history up until now the chart that's just computer-generated basically shows by 2015
[01:48:05.712 --> 01:48:12.681]  The big drop begins, and then it spikes back up in 2016 for a little bit, but still overall down from the high.
[01:48:13.001 --> 01:48:17.446]  And then it really goes down in 2017, back up a little bit into 2019.
[01:48:17.847 --> 01:48:19.909]  And then, are you saying it bottoms out by 2023?
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:26.265]  Yeah, actually, I think early 2020 is my best estimate.
[01:48:26.285 --> 01:48:29.628]  The reason, Alex, is we've got demographic cycles that we're known for.
[01:48:29.728 --> 01:48:37.797]  It's just a 46-year lag on the birth index for the peak in spending of the average person, a scientifically documentable fact and a projectable trend.
[01:48:37.897 --> 01:48:38.858]  Sure, and the elites know that.
[01:48:38.878 --> 01:48:41.561]  They look at populations and trends and where they're going to invest next.
[01:48:42.062 --> 01:48:43.283]  So let me ask you this, then.
[01:48:46.008 --> 01:48:50.170]  In the past, though, they didn't have this much market rigging, this much flash trading.
[01:48:50.511 --> 01:48:53.052]  They didn't have this high tech of derivatives.
[01:48:53.632 --> 01:48:58.555]  They just had old-fashioned counterfeiting and, you know, they had old-fashioned fractional reserve banking.
[01:48:58.895 --> 01:49:13.343]  With all the new manipulations they've got and automation and new technologies and more scientific mumbo-jumbo in the systems, is there a way that they can flim-flam out of this and break the 6,000-year-old trends?
[01:49:15.031 --> 01:49:16.792]  Well, you know, they already have, Alex.
[01:49:16.852 --> 01:49:28.601]  This boom on technologies, the internet peaking back in like 2007-8, demographic trends as we predicted 20 years ago, the baby boom would peak by late 2007, and they did.
[01:49:29.062 --> 01:49:30.923]  Housing would decline, they did.
[01:49:31.103 --> 01:49:33.365]  Autos are going to decline, start to decline next year.
[01:49:33.425 --> 01:49:34.546]  They come late on the cycle.
[01:49:34.806 --> 01:49:38.369]  We predicted all this stuff, but the government has kept the economy going.
[01:49:38.909 --> 01:49:48.952]  Not as good as before but kept it going and the stock market's gone to new highs because they're throwing trillions of dollars in the economy and it's not being lent because everybody over borrowed.
[01:49:48.992 --> 01:49:53.233]  Businesses and consumers already over in debt, over in capacity, too big a home.
[01:49:53.593 --> 01:50:00.555]  So the money's just going into speculation and it's driving the markets up and companies are buying back their stock and doing all this artificial
[01:50:00.555 --> 01:50:00.715]  Exactly.
[01:50:00.755 --> 01:50:02.697]  So what do you expect to happen with the QE?
[01:50:02.737 --> 01:50:04.618]  Will they dial it back or shut it off completely?
[01:50:04.838 --> 01:50:09.362]  And why is Germany the only major group we see complaining about QE Unlimited?
[01:50:24.588 --> 01:50:34.043]  Well, Germany's the only country that's gone through a hyperinflation in the last century, and so they know the ravages of inflation, and they're the only ones objecting.
[01:50:34.063 --> 01:50:36.968]  Everybody else is just like, well, cover it over, give us a free lunch.
[01:50:36.988 --> 01:50:38.691]  I mean, that's what everybody's doing.
[01:50:39.785 --> 01:50:47.652]  I think, you know, the Fed, I've been saying for the last year, the Fed is tapering, and now they're going back to zero, supposedly, this month.
[01:50:48.113 --> 01:50:49.954]  They're tapering right at the wrong time.
[01:50:50.055 --> 01:50:51.976]  I don't like QE in the first place.
[01:50:52.036 --> 01:51:01.365]  It's artificial, it distorts the markets, it kills free market capitalism and the whole innovation process that needs booms and busts and inflation and deflation and all the things they try to prevent.
[01:51:01.886 --> 01:51:03.728]  But they're tapering just as
[01:51:04.682 --> 01:51:07.943]  The second wave of demographic decline hits the United States.
[01:51:08.223 --> 01:51:11.205]  Homer Simpson peaked in 2007 at age 46.
[01:51:12.425 --> 01:51:21.329]  The wealthiest people, the top 20% in our society, they're still highly employed, college educated, benefiting from this bubble because they own most of the financial assets.
[01:51:21.709 --> 01:51:28.231]  They're due to peak late this year, right about now, and fall off the spending cliff just like Homer Simpson did.
[01:51:28.491 --> 01:51:30.452]  The Fed doesn't understand demographics.
[01:51:30.472 --> 01:51:32.513]  They just think, well, the economy's doing better.
[01:51:33.273 --> 01:51:40.136]  And so we can now taper off and not look like a bunch of idiots and act like we've got to stimulate the economy forever, because that's a sign that it's weak.
[01:51:40.516 --> 01:51:49.079]  To have to stimulate it for six years just to get 2% growth on average, when our normal growth rates are 3-4%, it shows how weak the economy is.
[01:51:49.819 --> 01:51:55.561]  To have this low inflation with this much money printing shows how strong deflationary trends are.
[01:51:55.581 --> 01:51:56.802]  Oh, I agree, and we've been seeing that.
[01:51:57.302 --> 01:51:59.984]  We've been seeing that happen now, some deflationary evidence.
[01:52:00.024 --> 01:52:01.985]  I want to get into that when we come back with Harry Dent.
[01:52:02.005 --> 01:52:12.593]  harrydent.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com
[01:52:24.661 --> 01:52:26.584]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.
[01:52:26.844 --> 01:52:31.369]  Is it time to convert paper 401ks and IRAs to solid gold and silver yet?

[01:52:39.478 --> 01:52:42.059]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[01:52:42.179 --> 01:52:46.180]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:47.721]  Silverlungs.com.

[01:53:03.386 --> 01:53:07.047]  See the Silverlungs generator and lung delivery system at Silverlungs.com.
[01:53:07.187 --> 01:53:08.688]  That's Silverlungs.com.
[01:53:09.068 --> 01:53:10.069]  The experts are clear.

[01:53:23.756 --> 01:53:31.380]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula, coming from a deep-earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:36.743]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[01:53:37.003 --> 01:53:37.903]  Not our iodine.
[01:53:38.023 --> 01:53:41.604]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[01:53:41.824 --> 01:53:44.165]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[01:55:09.917 --> 01:55:10.557]  Here's what we know.
[01:55:27.048 --> 01:55:28.648]  We live in a very rigged economy.
[01:55:29.749 --> 01:55:39.712]  There were mainstream news articles on Monday I saw admitting that the NSA is being used to give key intel to select global corporations, a lot of them not even US, to corner markets.
[01:55:41.332 --> 01:55:49.035]  We don't want to live in this rigged system where we pay for this big panopticonic spy grid and then a bunch of inside interests basically fix the economy.
[01:55:49.215 --> 01:55:54.177]  There's always been fixes and problems and that's what turns you into third world nation.
[01:55:56.098 --> 01:56:16.085]  Now they're scapegoating the free market for this crony system they built, where they bought the public for some chicken feed welfare, and then they have all this corporate welfare, and then they're always out trying to extinguish any real free market corporations or companies or individuals, as if the very idea of free market threatens their rule and hegemony.
[01:56:17.179 --> 01:56:18.500]  They want to kill the golden goose.
[01:56:18.620 --> 01:56:19.501]  That's my view on it.
[01:56:20.101 --> 01:56:30.149]  Harry Dent, best-selling author, researcher, former top analyst, and, well, he got us up a lot of their operations with Bain Capital, joins us about 15-20 minutes to the next hour.
[01:56:30.409 --> 01:56:41.057]  Then I'm going to go to medical doctors and others calling in with their take on Ebola and the bombshell news we broke in the last hour that there are people that clearly have Ebola in hospitals and the feds are whisking them away.
[01:56:41.378 --> 01:56:42.539]  This is just wild.
[01:56:42.979 --> 01:56:46.502]  And I've talked personally not just to this medical doctor on record on air, but another one I know.
[01:56:47.307 --> 01:56:51.209]  In a major city in Texas that said it is going on, and it's very freaked out.
[01:56:52.050 --> 01:57:10.741]  Mr. Dent, getting back into what we're seeing on a depressionary level with all this inflationary garbage paper on top of it, why there's that paradox, and then your take on my view that there's scapegoating capitalism for the rack and ruin that the departure from capitalism is causing.
[01:57:12.148 --> 01:57:15.869]  You know, Alex, free market capitalism always goes to extremes.
[01:57:16.529 --> 01:57:18.790]  But it rebalances itself, just like the body.
[01:57:18.830 --> 01:57:19.850]  The body gets out of balance.
[01:57:20.030 --> 01:57:24.892]  It knows how to rebalance itself, especially to eat the right foods and feed it right and stuff.
[01:57:25.432 --> 01:57:26.612]  The government started this.
[01:57:26.672 --> 01:57:29.013]  It started with Greenspan after the 87 crash.
[01:57:29.053 --> 01:57:30.974]  He said, oh my gosh, we can't have a crash like this.
[01:57:31.014 --> 01:57:32.454]  So he pushes interest rates down.
[01:57:32.934 --> 01:57:37.698]  And then, you know, the S&L crisis again, and then long-term capital management, a big hedge fund fail.
[01:57:38.098 --> 01:57:43.503]  They've been pushing down interest rates, short-term and long-term, manipulating the economy.
[01:57:43.523 --> 01:57:45.624]  They don't trust the Fremont Capitalist System.
[01:57:45.924 --> 01:57:48.867]  And if you don't let it work, you don't get the innovation.
[01:57:49.147 --> 01:57:53.370]  The innovation comes from the extremes of boom and bust, inflation and deflation.
[01:57:53.610 --> 01:57:55.631]  We need those dynamic opposites.
[01:57:55.871 --> 01:57:58.513]  They're trying to turn this darn thing into a machine.
[01:57:58.793 --> 01:57:59.534]  It's not a machine.
[01:57:59.594 --> 01:58:01.975]  It's an organic process just like our body.
[01:58:02.015 --> 01:58:04.357]  So they are killing the golden goose.
[01:58:04.377 --> 01:58:06.718]  We just had David Stockman at our major conference.
[01:58:06.738 --> 01:58:07.539]  He said the same thing.
[01:58:07.579 --> 01:58:10.901]  He called it the corruption of capitalism in America.
[01:58:11.341 --> 01:58:12.402]  So that's what they're doing.
[01:58:12.442 --> 01:58:15.084]  And they're blaming the free markets when things go wrong.
[01:58:15.224 --> 01:58:17.245]  They've been rigging this since 1987.
[01:58:19.602 --> 01:58:25.430]  With the President's Committee on Open Markets, the Plunge Protection Team, and many other systems, this is a rigged game.
[01:58:25.710 --> 01:58:28.354]  My issue with it being rigged is not that it just kills innovation.
[01:58:29.415 --> 01:58:35.503]  It allows select groups to capitalize on it at the expense of other real entrepreneurs and risk-takers.
[01:58:36.229 --> 01:58:36.689]  No, that's right.
[01:58:36.729 --> 01:58:37.991]  There's no question about it.
[01:58:38.811 --> 01:58:47.158]  And by the Fed keeping this bubble going, even when it burst in 2008, all they're doing is favoring all those special interests on Wall Street.
[01:58:47.539 --> 01:58:53.884]  I mean, I want to see some major financial institutions and investment funds go down because they deserve to.
[01:58:54.224 --> 01:58:55.465]  I want to see banks go down.
[01:58:55.485 --> 01:58:56.787]  They made horrible loans.
[01:58:57.087 --> 01:59:03.393]  In the free market system, the way we learn and grow is there's consequences when you do something wrong.
[01:59:03.433 --> 01:59:04.154]  That's how you learn.
[01:59:04.214 --> 01:59:11.862]  And people don't realize even in human life, not just in our economy, we learn and grow and evolve the most when we learn from our mistakes.
[01:59:12.142 --> 01:59:13.544]  Not just when we're unsuccessful.
[01:59:13.664 --> 01:59:14.986]  We learn during crises.
[01:59:15.506 --> 01:59:16.067]  Exactly.
[01:59:16.388 --> 01:59:24.618]  The greatest innovations, the greatest leaders have always, and I mean always, come through crises like the 1930s and World War II or like the 1970s inflation era.
[01:59:28.573 --> 01:59:30.474]  Harry Dent is our guest right now.
[01:59:30.554 --> 01:59:35.317]  HarryDent.com forward slash Alex Jones to find the free chapter of his book on the China crisis.
[01:59:36.178 --> 01:59:37.159]  I want to talk about that.
[01:59:37.219 --> 01:59:39.160]  Chapter 10, the China disaster ahead.
[01:59:39.900 --> 01:59:43.303]  A huge ticking time bomb and we'll break down how that affects us here.
[01:59:43.643 --> 01:59:47.045]  And then your calls are coming up on the Ebola situation.
[01:59:47.085 --> 01:59:48.126]  Stay with us, third hour.
[01:59:52.128 --> 01:59:56.091]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:59:59.437 --> 02:00:06.486]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:00:06.606 --> 02:00:08.768]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:00:08.949 --> 02:00:14.055]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:00:14.235 --> 02:00:19.181]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:00:19.381 --> 02:00:22.444]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:00:22.704 --> 02:00:26.568]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:00:26.788 --> 02:00:31.032]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:00:31.113 --> 02:00:41.142]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:00:41.342 --> 02:00:43.865]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:00:44.045 --> 02:00:45.946]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:01:15.492 --> 02:01:16.153]  Big Brother.
[02:01:16.813 --> 02:01:17.834]  Mainstream media.
[02:01:18.574 --> 02:01:19.675]  Government cover-ups.
[02:01:20.336 --> 02:01:21.136]  You want answers?
[02:01:21.917 --> 02:01:22.817]  Well, so does he.
[02:01:23.458 --> 02:01:27.101]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:27.661 --> 02:01:31.764]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:01:32.084 --> 02:01:35.327]  Harry Dent, economist, best-selling author, is our guest.
[02:01:36.167 --> 02:02:01.665]  Coming up in about 15 minutes, I'm going to go back to your calls, medical people, doctors, you name it, calling in to give their take on Dr. James Lorenzi coming on from the Cass Regional Medical Center, listing the hospital where he was in residency before he was fully a doctor, where he talked to the doctors and nurses and people are coming in bleeding out and they're saying it's Ebola and they're whisking them away and saying shut up about it.
[02:02:02.305 --> 02:02:04.446]  I mean it's just huge news and telling them say that it's
[02:02:05.708 --> 02:02:07.908]  You know, something else that doesn't even have those symptoms.
[02:02:08.669 --> 02:02:10.269]  So, that's coming up.
[02:02:10.329 --> 02:02:13.029]  So, thank you, Phil, who's a physician, and others for holding.
[02:02:13.409 --> 02:02:17.110]  I want to hear from you, Jeff, who's a firefighter, Ben, environmental health worker.
[02:02:18.130 --> 02:02:20.711]  Our guest right now is Mr. Dent.
[02:02:21.591 --> 02:02:24.452]  Let's get into the free chapter you've got up for all the listeners.
[02:02:24.492 --> 02:02:27.752]  I appreciate you doing that at harrydent.com forward slash Alex Jones.
[02:02:28.472 --> 02:02:31.233]  China, Chapter 10, the China disaster ahead.
[02:02:32.591 --> 02:02:36.492]  Yeah, Alex, this did not make it in time for the U.S.
[02:02:36.552 --> 02:02:39.733]  version of the demographic clip, but it did make it in my Asian books.
[02:02:39.773 --> 02:02:47.516]  I want to make sure people can get this chapter, so you can get it free at harrydent.com slash unpublished or by going to slash Alex Jones.
[02:02:48.676 --> 02:02:51.038]  This is the biggest story of our time.
[02:02:51.518 --> 02:02:53.559]  China has become the second largest country.
[02:02:53.579 --> 02:02:55.080]  It's been the fastest growing country.
[02:02:55.140 --> 02:03:03.184]  People understand how much that economy is manipulated, top-down, centrally planned, more than any economy ever in history.
[02:03:03.624 --> 02:03:09.327]  They have moved 15% of the population, 220 million people in the last 15 years.
[02:03:09.367 --> 02:03:10.247]  The biggest push
[02:03:10.247 --> 02:03:10.427]  I think?
[02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:37.382]  They have 30 to 50% more industrial capacity than they need.
[02:03:38.043 --> 02:03:42.706]  Infrastructures, bridges, railroads, roads, the nowhere that make any other place look like nothing.
[02:03:43.887 --> 02:03:46.269]  27% of their urban homes are vacant.
[02:03:46.649 --> 02:03:56.717]  They have built enough infrastructure and housing and offices and all this stuff for the next 12 to 15 years, even at the highest migration rates in history, which no way is going to continue.
[02:03:57.446 --> 02:03:59.027]  The China bubble is going to burst.
[02:03:59.067 --> 02:04:07.253]  These 220 million unskilled people are not even legal citizens in the cities they're in, only in their rural areas.
[02:04:07.433 --> 02:04:20.562]  I think not only is this migration going to stop and this over-building is going to collapse on itself, but a lot of these rural people are going to have to move back to rural areas if they're left and haven't paved over them already with empty condos.
[02:04:20.602 --> 02:04:22.824]  But China is the largest, most
[02:04:22.944 --> 02:04:23.584]  We're good to go.
[02:04:51.607 --> 02:04:57.755]  It will reverberate around the world more than the subprime crisis and the banking crisis in the U.S.
[02:04:58.156 --> 02:04:58.717]  back in 2008.
[02:04:59.758 --> 02:05:01.060]  You've got to get this chapter.
[02:05:01.080 --> 02:05:03.203]  I go to it in depth.
[02:05:03.304 --> 02:05:04.846]  This is the biggest thing that's going to happen.
[02:05:04.866 --> 02:05:07.630]  The other thing, Alex, just to bring it up while I'm at it, Germany.
[02:05:08.456 --> 02:05:18.420]  In the late 80s, 88, 89, I said Japan's going to fall off a cliff and collapse in the 90s while the US and Europe have the strongest demographic baby boom spending trend in history.
[02:05:18.700 --> 02:05:19.960]  That's exactly what happened.
[02:05:20.040 --> 02:05:24.642]  Germany has a worse demographic slowdown from 2014 to 2022 than Japan had in the 90s.
[02:05:28.163 --> 02:05:32.944]  And worse than any country in Europe, and many follow it, Germany is going to lead Europe down.
[02:05:33.464 --> 02:05:41.245]  And like we mentioned earlier, Germany is the only country smart enough to say that endless money printing is not the way to deal with this crisis.
[02:05:41.605 --> 02:05:42.706]  Debt restructuring.
[02:05:42.726 --> 02:05:45.946]  The reality is they're smart enough on that, but guess what?
[02:05:46.126 --> 02:05:47.606]  They're supposed to hold Europe together.
[02:05:47.906 --> 02:05:49.427]  They're going to keep falling apart.
[02:05:49.467 --> 02:05:53.787]  You think they're hesitant, QE, or hesitant to bail out southern European countries.
[02:05:53.827 --> 02:05:56.828]  Now wait until their economy keeps failing in the last
[02:06:00.430 --> 02:06:00.991]  That's right.
[02:06:01.091 --> 02:06:07.515]  Final segment with our guest harrydent.com forward slash Alex Jones to find the free chapter or get the book and then your phone call.
[02:06:07.535 --> 02:06:07.956]  Stay with us.
[02:06:09.502 --> 02:06:10.503]  The experts are clear.
[02:06:10.823 --> 02:06:17.809]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[02:06:17.949 --> 02:06:24.195]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:24.215 --> 02:06:31.861]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula, coming from a deep-earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[02:06:32.162 --> 02:06:37.206]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:06:37.466 --> 02:06:38.346]  Not our iodine.
[02:06:38.486 --> 02:06:44.629]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[02:07:09.656 --> 02:07:13.157]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:07:13.317 --> 02:07:17.278]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:07:17.598 --> 02:07:19.038]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:07:19.378 --> 02:07:26.940]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:07:27.220 --> 02:07:28.081]  But for how long?
[02:07:28.361 --> 02:07:34.622]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:07:35.002 --> 02:07:37.823]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:07:39.298 --> 02:07:49.405]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[02:07:49.865 --> 02:07:55.909]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:07:56.329 --> 02:07:58.550]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.

[02:08:09.079 --> 02:08:18.605]  Using unparalleled research and the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[02:08:18.745 --> 02:08:28.490]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[02:08:28.670 --> 02:08:31.592]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[02:08:31.792 --> 02:08:32.413]  I think so.
[02:08:46.909 --> 02:08:48.269]  Well, it's the final countdown.
[02:09:36.223 --> 02:09:36.685]  Yeah.
[02:09:43.035 --> 02:09:46.498]  Monday through Friday, ladies and gentlemen, from 11 a.m.
[02:09:46.718 --> 02:09:48.220]  Central to 2 p.m.
[02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:53.785]  Central, we're here live, back weeknight, 7 o'clock Central, with InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:09:54.265 --> 02:09:55.546]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:09:55.586 --> 02:09:56.467]  Here's some of the headlines.
[02:09:56.928 --> 02:09:59.009]  FBI and DHS issue bulletin.
[02:09:59.410 --> 02:10:02.092]  Warning of IS attacks on police in U.S.
[02:10:03.914 --> 02:10:08.178]  I've been saying for four years that Al Qaeda forces funded by the West
[02:10:09.226 --> 02:10:14.369]  Getting Stinger missiles from the West to attack Assad and Libya and everybody else would end up coming over here.
[02:10:14.670 --> 02:10:15.250]  Now it's happening.
[02:10:15.270 --> 02:10:16.711]  Look what happened in Canada yesterday.
[02:10:17.351 --> 02:10:23.095]  We've got an investigative journalist joining us at the bottom of the hour, Dan Dix, from Ottawa to break that down.
[02:10:24.296 --> 02:10:27.278]  Also, Ebola inevitable from U.S.
[02:10:27.318 --> 02:10:30.720]  southern border is basically what Southcom is now saying, but it's wide open.
[02:10:31.724 --> 02:10:34.465]  George Soros calls for war with Russia.
[02:10:34.485 --> 02:10:35.406]  A Kurt Nimmo story.
[02:10:36.266 --> 02:10:39.208]  No refusal blood draw checkpoint planned for Ohio.
[02:10:39.768 --> 02:10:42.350]  Protesters who plan to smash police brutality.
[02:10:42.730 --> 02:10:44.691]  Pumpkins arrested for littering and assault.
[02:10:45.331 --> 02:10:49.073]  Well, they were throwing the pumpkins across police lines in the direction of police.
[02:10:49.593 --> 02:10:51.655]  I mean, it's just asking for it.
[02:10:52.275 --> 02:10:53.656]  We got Ebola in the country, folks.
[02:10:54.656 --> 02:10:55.777]  Ferguson stuff needs to stop.
[02:10:57.345 --> 02:11:03.410]  Australian government funds a new play called Kill Climate Deniers.
[02:11:04.011 --> 02:11:08.235]  Weather Channel co-founder, effort to prove global warming is man-made, has failed.
[02:11:10.287 --> 02:11:15.210]  Calibration error changes GOP votes to Democrats in Illinois County.
[02:11:15.570 --> 02:11:16.110]  Fox News.
[02:11:16.130 --> 02:11:18.051]  Yeah, I'm sure that's what's really going on.
[02:11:18.291 --> 02:11:23.134]  That's some of the news up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:11:23.434 --> 02:11:29.978]  Democrats are racing away from Obama right now and he's being booed and folks are walking off with a few fundraisers he comes to.
[02:11:30.418 --> 02:11:37.862]  The New York Times said yesterday, of course, that they are, quote, in a emergency situation, have hit the panic button.
[02:11:38.602 --> 02:11:40.123]  I'm saying the President's not relevant.
[02:11:40.704 --> 02:11:42.104]  He's gone in two years.
[02:11:42.845 --> 02:11:44.466]  They're now race-baiting heavily.
[02:11:44.506 --> 02:11:48.829]  DrudgeReport.com has articles and video of that unfolding.
[02:11:49.149 --> 02:11:58.716]  From The Daily Caller, going back to Harry Dent, economist, researcher, best-selling author, harrydent.com forward slash Alex Jones.
[02:11:59.116 --> 02:12:05.160]  You can get his new book there on the site, The Demographic Cliff, that I absolutely agree with.
[02:12:05.860 --> 02:12:07.762]  In the time we've got left, what is your
[02:12:08.702 --> 02:12:10.484]  ...prognosis on Germany finishing up.
[02:12:10.804 --> 02:12:24.657]  What do you make of what's happening in the Ukraine, short-term, long-term, and then shifting back to the elections and what's happening here, what your view on Obama and what he might pull as a wild card in the economy?
[02:12:25.660 --> 02:12:39.090]  Well, you know, the first thing with Russia and Ukraine, we have a geopolitical cycle that I developed in late 2005 and early 2006 to add to my demographic cycles, because I realized it has a huge impact on stock valuations.
[02:12:39.370 --> 02:12:41.972]  And this shifts about every 18 years.
[02:12:41.992 --> 02:12:45.054]  1983 to 2000, nothing went wrong in the world.
[02:12:45.094 --> 02:12:50.238]  We had one quick war with Saddam Hussein, attacked him, backed out, no big deal.
[02:12:50.718 --> 02:12:52.440]  2001 forward, we know what happened.
[02:12:52.460 --> 02:12:54.101]  9-11 and then, I don't know,
[02:12:54.141 --> 02:12:54.581]  I think so.
[02:13:11.609 --> 02:13:12.610]  Moving into Ukraine.
[02:13:12.690 --> 02:13:14.832]  Obviously, they want to restore the Soviet Union.
[02:13:14.872 --> 02:13:23.918]  They are one of the worst demographic countries ahead, a declining power, but they still have the only real offensive force in the world outside the United States.
[02:13:23.938 --> 02:13:26.479]  So this is a mini World War III possible.
[02:13:27.020 --> 02:13:37.887]  This geopolitical cycle points down from 2001 into at least late 2019, early 2020, which means we got five more years of this getting worse.
[02:13:38.047 --> 02:13:40.569]  And by the way... It's not just about over, it's not.
[02:13:41.369 --> 02:14:00.770]  I mean, just to back up what you're saying, look at the Ministry of Defense report from 2007, the London Guardian reported on, uh, revolution, flash mobs and brain chips, a grim vision of the future, and then you can actually read the report from the Ministry of Defense, uh, future strategic context planning, they predict
[02:14:01.511 --> 02:14:11.278]  Basically, 2015, 2016 through 2022 or so, global meltdown, just absolute insane terrorism, wars, you name it.
[02:14:11.739 --> 02:14:16.903]  The Pentagon then declassified last year a report from the same year saying what you're saying, saying what I'm saying.
[02:14:16.923 --> 02:14:18.004]  It's not like we're being pessimists.
[02:14:18.364 --> 02:14:20.546]  We're saying folks need to be ready for this in these cycles.
[02:14:21.570 --> 02:14:22.550]  The elites know this.
[02:14:22.590 --> 02:14:23.771]  George Soros knows this.
[02:14:24.411 --> 02:14:28.233]  The CIA people I know, Pentagon people, high-level all know this.
[02:14:28.593 --> 02:14:30.053]  Billionaires I know know this.
[02:14:30.713 --> 02:14:32.034]  All the real analysts know this.
[02:14:32.294 --> 02:14:40.357]  So you've got separate real analysts like you who are out there talking to real investors, institutional investors, retail investors that are smart enough to research.
[02:14:40.677 --> 02:14:42.278]  Then you've got the CNBC crowd
[02:14:43.098 --> 02:14:50.744]  That's kind of got its own brand of hype with Jim Cramer up there, but even some truth comes out on those shows now about how we have a crony centralized system.
[02:14:51.644 --> 02:14:54.266]  I mean, how can you be so accurate?
[02:14:54.286 --> 02:14:55.607]  And we know what's going on.
[02:14:55.868 --> 02:15:01.252]  The Pentagon knows what's going on, but we're not really hearing this message a lot of other places.
[02:15:01.852 --> 02:15:02.693]  It's just crazy.
[02:15:02.733 --> 02:15:04.154]  What do you expect to come out of this?
[02:15:04.892 --> 02:15:13.381]  Well, again, Alex, it's only going to get worse at a time when demographic trends get worse, innovation slowing down after everybody's been on the Internet, and this sunspot cycle is pointing out.
[02:15:13.521 --> 02:15:18.686]  All four of our cycles are down at the same time from late 2014 to early 2020.
[02:15:19.387 --> 02:15:25.954]  That's only happened twice, the mid-70s and early 30s, the worst two economic crises in the last century.
[02:15:25.994 --> 02:15:28.156]  So it's only going to get worse.
[02:15:28.596 --> 02:15:31.116]  And so, and these cycles are very solid.
[02:15:31.156 --> 02:15:35.557]  Again, since 2001, geopolitics trends have just gotten worse.
[02:15:35.737 --> 02:15:41.638]  The stock market is acting like there's nothing wrong in the world, and that's why people say, oh, the market's not overvalued.
[02:15:41.858 --> 02:15:45.379]  It's way overvalued compared to demographic trends and geopolitical.
[02:15:45.399 --> 02:15:53.660]  So the stock market's going to have to get in reality for one thing, but you're going to have to look at your life and your business and say, it's not just the stock market and economy going down.
[02:15:53.700 --> 02:15:57.721]  The world's going to get much more uncertain and more dangerous.
[02:15:58.041 --> 02:16:01.342]  Well, my gut tells me China's unprecedented manipulation, U.S.
[02:16:01.362 --> 02:16:11.324]  manipulation, EU manipulation, all this manipulation will only make it worse when these bubbles finally implode and they can't pump them up again anymore.
[02:16:11.784 --> 02:16:18.885]  The book, The Demographic Cliff, is available in bookstores everywhere or at harrydent.com forward slash Alex Jones.
[02:16:18.905 --> 02:16:24.047]  You can find right there a free chapter that you didn't end up getting in the book on the China disaster ahead.
[02:16:24.307 --> 02:16:25.487]  Thank you so much for the time, sir.
[02:16:26.167 --> 02:16:26.768]  Thank you Alex.
[02:16:27.368 --> 02:16:28.189]  Always interesting.
[02:16:28.909 --> 02:16:30.971]  And I tell ya, I'm not being pessimistic.
[02:16:30.991 --> 02:16:32.052]  People say, oh don't be pessimistic.
[02:16:32.653 --> 02:16:33.513]  You gotta live in the real world.
[02:16:33.553 --> 02:16:34.834]  I'm being very positive here.
[02:16:35.595 --> 02:16:40.299]  Like the police know that murders and robberies and rapes more than double on a full moon.
[02:16:40.900 --> 02:16:44.122]  You can give whatever reason you think that is, they know that in major cities.
[02:16:44.743 --> 02:16:45.884]  It's also bad in the countryside.
[02:16:47.908 --> 02:16:48.509]  It's cycles.
[02:16:48.549 --> 02:16:49.510]  We run off cycles.
[02:16:49.971 --> 02:16:51.192]  And it's not mumbo-jumbo.
[02:16:51.312 --> 02:16:52.133]  It's the moon.
[02:16:52.193 --> 02:16:52.854]  It's the sun.
[02:16:54.436 --> 02:16:55.878]  The sun causes all the life on earth.
[02:16:56.498 --> 02:16:58.260]  And it goes into these cycles historically.
[02:16:58.821 --> 02:17:02.225]  And then you add the demographic cliffs that run congruent with it.
[02:17:02.606 --> 02:17:04.187]  And you add the military and the oil.
[02:17:05.629 --> 02:17:09.211]  And the energy and the carrying capacity, it is crazy.
[02:17:09.511 --> 02:17:11.833]  Now, I really appreciate Phil, who says he's a physician.
[02:17:12.233 --> 02:17:13.954]  Holden, we'll go to Ben and Jeff as well.
[02:17:14.314 --> 02:17:16.315]  I cut Den off early so I could get to you guys.
[02:17:17.156 --> 02:17:18.797]  Again, I put the call out 800-259-9231.
[02:17:18.817 --> 02:17:19.497]  800-259-9231.
[02:17:19.517 --> 02:17:24.500]  Are you military?
[02:17:24.560 --> 02:17:25.100]  Are you police?
[02:17:25.140 --> 02:17:25.921]  Are you firefighters?
[02:17:25.981 --> 02:17:27.021]  Are you medical doctors?
[02:17:27.502 --> 02:17:28.682]  Are you medical workers?
[02:17:28.742 --> 02:17:29.643]  Are you RNs?
[02:17:29.803 --> 02:17:30.984]  Are you nurse practitioners?
[02:17:32.168 --> 02:17:47.667]  What do you say about Dr. James Lorenzi, who was on, who confirmed what other medical doctors I know were saying, that people come in with what's clearly Ebola bleeding out, they're told to say it's malaria that has really none of the same symptoms, and then the feds sneak them off like something out of a science fiction dystopic movie.
[02:17:48.894 --> 02:17:51.215]  What do you have to say about that bombshell interview?
[02:17:51.555 --> 02:17:56.477]  We'll have the articles up soon on InfoWars.com as all of this breaks here today.
[02:17:57.077 --> 02:18:02.719]  But Phil in Florida, who says you're a physician, tell us your take on this.
[02:18:04.680 --> 02:18:06.321]  Yes, Alex, I am a physician.
[02:18:06.381 --> 02:18:10.102]  I'm a family medicine doctor here in Daytona Beach.
[02:18:11.543 --> 02:18:13.904]  I just wanted to add something to what Dr. Lorenzi said.
[02:18:15.243 --> 02:18:20.724]  Even though the feds might be coming in and breaking down, before I went to medical school, I was a lab tech.
[02:18:21.004 --> 02:18:26.885]  And I don't, you know, there's a way to prove whether it's malaria or not.
[02:18:26.905 --> 02:18:39.628]  And what you want to do is, if you're the lab tech, and it never really bothered me as a lab tech, to make a slide and maybe just put it under there, because you have to demonstrate the parasite in the peripheral blood smear.
[02:18:40.108 --> 02:18:43.549]  And if it's not malaria, then the parasite's not going to be there.
[02:18:46.581 --> 02:18:54.448]  That's right, but I mean, I'm no rocket scientist, but Ebola and malaria, malaria doesn't make you bleed out all your holes, does it?
[02:18:55.569 --> 02:19:04.437]  Only in severe, severe cases, and it's nowhere near as severe as what we've been seeing with Ebola now or in the past.
[02:19:05.959 --> 02:19:11.404]  So, like you said earlier, there's a raging fever, you might urinate blood,
[02:19:13.301 --> 02:19:22.571]  Occasionally, rarely, people bleed in the intestinal tract, but the one way to make that diagnosis is to grab that slide.
[02:19:23.452 --> 02:19:33.142]  I don't know, when I worked afternoon shift or midnight shift, like I said, there wasn't anybody there to stop me from maybe just making an extra slide and sticking it under the refrigerator there.
[02:19:33.162 --> 02:19:33.683]  Exactly.
[02:19:33.723 --> 02:19:34.544]  Let me ask you this, Doc.
[02:19:35.771 --> 02:19:37.712]  What do you make of them disappearing, the people?
[02:19:37.752 --> 02:19:43.895]  We have it from the Border Patrol, ICE, and two medical doctors that I've talked to personally, that this is going on.
[02:19:44.415 --> 02:19:48.697]  So, even if it isn't, and I hope it's not Ebola, why are they whisking him away and no record?
[02:19:49.897 --> 02:19:53.359]  No, that's, I mean, I'm in the same camp with you and Dr. Lorenzi on that.
[02:19:54.519 --> 02:20:02.883]  It's either a false flag that they're planning, they're going to unleash these people at some point, or they don't want to panic and mass hysteria of how severe the problem actually is.
[02:20:04.773 --> 02:20:08.756]  But the way to stop a real panic is to be up front early on and shut it down, right?
[02:20:09.576 --> 02:20:10.137]  Absolutely.
[02:20:10.277 --> 02:20:11.498]  Just isolate the people.
[02:20:11.838 --> 02:20:18.622]  I mean, you know, the most ridiculous thing is just letting people flow through here without any isolation.
[02:20:19.283 --> 02:20:19.863]  It's a joke!
[02:20:19.883 --> 02:20:23.265]  The UN model says we will get more flights with Ebola.
[02:20:23.285 --> 02:20:25.847]  They're predicting that we'll get more Ebola.
[02:20:25.967 --> 02:20:26.868]  What are they doing?
[02:20:27.785 --> 02:20:28.005]  Yeah.
[02:20:28.265 --> 02:20:31.648]  From there, just isolate them from the airport for 21 days.
[02:20:32.369 --> 02:20:36.032]  You know, whatever reason you're here, the problem is you came from this area.
[02:20:36.432 --> 02:20:36.773]  That's right.
[02:20:36.813 --> 02:20:41.256]  If you're dumb enough to try to come here and you're not a citizen, you're going to get locked up for 21 days.
[02:20:42.618 --> 02:20:48.322]  I mean, you know, and not to violate the right or anything or passage, but just to make sure you're not going to kill off our population.
[02:20:48.342 --> 02:20:48.803]  Well, sure.
[02:20:48.823 --> 02:20:49.143]  Exactly.
[02:20:49.243 --> 02:20:54.648]  I'm anti-police state, but it's not police state since ancient times to quarantine sick people so everybody doesn't get it.
[02:20:55.407 --> 02:20:56.672]  I mean, that's just what you do.
[02:20:57.937 --> 02:20:58.419]  Amazing.
[02:20:58.520 --> 02:20:59.223]  Alright, sir.
[02:20:59.524 --> 02:21:00.729]  Anything else you'd like to add, Doc?
[02:21:01.736 --> 02:21:02.637]  Uh, no.
[02:21:02.777 --> 02:21:03.878]  Keep up the good fight, Alex.
[02:21:04.038 --> 02:21:04.479]  I'll try.
[02:21:04.499 --> 02:21:05.039]  God bless you.

[02:21:12.606 --> 02:21:15.168]  It takes less than 10 seconds to kick in a door.
[02:21:15.468 --> 02:21:18.171]  10 seconds is not enough time to protect your family.
[02:21:18.251 --> 02:21:20.012]  And what would happen if you were not home?
[02:21:20.212 --> 02:21:22.895]  EZ Armor is the ultimate security solution.

[02:22:37.718 --> 02:22:41.280]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.

[02:24:38.251 --> 02:24:38.992]  Hey, Boomer!
[02:24:39.232 --> 02:24:42.573]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[02:24:42.673 --> 02:24:44.253]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[02:24:44.354 --> 02:24:46.114]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[02:24:46.294 --> 02:24:51.796]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[02:24:52.136 --> 02:24:52.897]  I know, right?
[02:24:52.977 --> 02:24:53.897]  You love it, too!
[02:24:54.277 --> 02:24:55.598]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[02:24:55.738 --> 02:24:56.618]  Let's go get some.

[02:25:13.209 --> 02:25:33.835]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here back live and I want to speak very slowly and very clearly because we were very clear on this in the first hour and we have articles coming out in the next 15-20 minutes at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com so this can all be very very clear.
[02:25:35.546 --> 02:25:45.570]  James Lorenzi, who is a doctor, he works at Cass Regional Medical Center and surrounding medical centers that are affiliated with it.
[02:25:47.150 --> 02:25:50.331]  They have not had what was suspected Ebola case.
[02:25:50.971 --> 02:25:53.032]  We were very clear when he was on about that.
[02:25:53.912 --> 02:26:00.675]  What happens is, listeners don't listen, because there's millions of them, so some of them are going to be out of any group, not paying attention.
[02:26:02.699 --> 02:26:08.122]  And so they start bombarding Cass Regional Medical Center asking them if they have Ebola.
[02:26:08.322 --> 02:26:10.284]  They don't have any Ebola cases.
[02:26:10.864 --> 02:26:18.769]  The only confirmed Ebola cases were in Dallas and then they let one nurse fly around a bunch of places and more aircraft are coming in with Ebola.
[02:26:20.290 --> 02:26:27.234]  He did his medical internship when he was out of college before he became a full doctor at Truman Lakewood Medical Center.
[02:26:28.319 --> 02:26:39.443]  And we're going through his interview, getting all an article, but that's where he got one of the calls from a doctor and nurses he knows, saying people come in bleeding out their rear end, you name it, looks like Ebola.
[02:26:39.743 --> 02:26:41.643]  The feds swoop in, they disappear the people.
[02:26:42.124 --> 02:26:42.884]  That's the issue.
[02:26:42.964 --> 02:26:44.044]  Could be malaria.
[02:26:45.365 --> 02:26:46.685]  But the point is, is the cover-up.
[02:26:46.905 --> 02:26:48.286]  We have this from the Border Patrol.
[02:26:48.806 --> 02:26:49.526]  So let's be clear.
[02:26:49.626 --> 02:26:52.827]  Cass Regional Medical Center doesn't even have suspected cases.
[02:26:52.867 --> 02:26:53.347]  They're fine.
[02:26:54.428 --> 02:26:55.028]  Let's be clear.
[02:26:56.158 --> 02:27:01.302]  Former top Border Patrol agent, Zach Taylor, who told us this weeks ago that they're scooping folks up on the border.
[02:27:01.483 --> 02:27:02.163]  He doesn't have it.
[02:27:02.483 --> 02:27:03.024]  I don't have it.
[02:27:03.384 --> 02:27:04.825]  Anthony doesn't have it, okay?
[02:27:05.706 --> 02:27:13.413]  The story is, and I'm not talking down to most of the audience, but those out there, this is how Ebola creates a panic, because the government's lying, that destroys confidence.
[02:27:13.693 --> 02:27:20.459]  We have a medical doctor on that confirms what a major medical doctor in Texas told us over a week ago, that we know personally.
[02:27:21.260 --> 02:27:23.962]  That this stuff's going on in Texas and they've been told shut up.
[02:27:24.222 --> 02:27:25.282]  We've had firefighters on.
[02:27:25.783 --> 02:27:30.686]  We've covered the news where the police and others are told don't say Ebola when you think it is.
[02:27:30.746 --> 02:27:32.226]  So that's the story.
[02:27:33.287 --> 02:27:35.248]  We got people dying, vomiting on airplanes.
[02:27:35.828 --> 02:27:37.730]  That doesn't mean that's Ebola 100%.
[02:27:37.950 --> 02:27:39.110]  We're just reporting on it.
[02:27:42.279 --> 02:27:47.904]  It's the Truman facility, not affiliated with Cass Regional Medical Center.
[02:27:48.224 --> 02:27:54.390]  Truman Lakewood Medical Center is where they thought this may have happened, and we want to investigate the person being disappeared out of there.
[02:27:55.090 --> 02:27:55.430]  Okay?
[02:27:55.450 --> 02:27:57.893]  I'm going to be very clear, because this is the message I get.
[02:27:58.073 --> 02:28:01.015]  That's why I said he had a lot of courage, because they'll attack anybody for anything.
[02:28:01.235 --> 02:28:03.738]  He could say that the Capitol was on fire, and they'd probably crucify him.
[02:28:04.462 --> 02:28:09.466]  Now, he got a call from the head of the major company, who was saying, I like you, you're nice, you just better clarify.
[02:28:09.947 --> 02:28:11.468]  Well, that CEO needs to know this.
[02:28:12.348 --> 02:28:15.691]  He did what he was supposed to do, he did put out the accurate info.
[02:28:16.472 --> 02:28:20.435]  The fact that the public doesn't know which end is up sometimes, it's just the way it is.
[02:28:20.875 --> 02:28:29.623]  You cannot, you know, it's the fault of the government not responding to the Ebola, and not having proper training, that's causing this fear.
[02:28:30.703 --> 02:28:32.304]  Okay, and the people have a right to know.
[02:28:32.324 --> 02:28:38.108]  That's why no one will touch this, and it's how the cover-up works, because everyone is so scared to talk about what's going on.
[02:28:38.408 --> 02:28:43.212]  Of course if you've got a bunch of Ebola patients being brought in, it's going to start spreading like it's done in Spain.
[02:28:44.090 --> 02:28:45.091]  That's why they never did it before.
[02:28:45.531 --> 02:28:47.973]  Of course you bring in people from West Africa that's plagued with Ebola.
[02:28:48.153 --> 02:28:49.034]  You're going to get Ebola!
[02:28:49.454 --> 02:28:50.355]  That's the issue!
[02:28:50.655 --> 02:28:52.216]  Not those of us reporting on it.
[02:28:52.837 --> 02:28:55.038]  So again, Cass Regional Medical Center, great folks.
[02:28:55.379 --> 02:28:56.880]  We were clear that's not where this was.
[02:28:57.280 --> 02:29:01.803]  If it was there, a suspected case and a cover-up, we would say that.
[02:29:02.084 --> 02:29:03.084]  We did not say that.
[02:29:03.104 --> 02:29:04.145]  I'm going to say it one more time.
[02:29:04.425 --> 02:29:06.227]  Truman Lakewood Medical Center.
[02:29:06.587 --> 02:29:08.729]  Truman Lakewood, and that was not confirmed Ebola either.
[02:29:09.409 --> 02:29:10.809]  People there were very suspicious.
[02:29:11.190 --> 02:29:13.350]  And the people, the person was then disappeared.
[02:29:13.650 --> 02:29:15.251]  That's what needs to be investigated.
[02:29:15.871 --> 02:29:16.871]  This is a free country.
[02:29:17.052 --> 02:29:18.352]  We are what's left of the free press.
[02:29:18.732 --> 02:29:19.932]  We will continue to report it.
[02:29:21.433 --> 02:29:22.073]  Here's the message.
[02:29:22.513 --> 02:29:22.813]  Urgent.
[02:29:23.954 --> 02:29:30.756]  Dr. Lorenzi is getting a flight from his hospital CEO and he wants you to clarify that Ebola is not at his hospital, Cass Regional Medical Center.
[02:29:31.276 --> 02:29:36.398]  It is at other hospitals, potentially, potential Ebola, in the area.
[02:29:37.617 --> 02:29:42.001]  And it's Missouri, folks, not... Anyways, not Kansas.
[02:29:42.301 --> 02:29:46.504]  Now, again, ladies and gentlemen, we don't know this was Ebola.
[02:29:47.705 --> 02:29:51.949]  What we know is, is that common sense shows it would continue to spread, and we know there's a cover-up.
[02:29:51.969 --> 02:29:53.790]  They're telling firefighters and police to cover it up.
[02:29:54.431 --> 02:29:56.353]  So, that right there, we're investigating.
[02:29:57.694 --> 02:29:59.655]  You talked to the medical doctor here in Texas.
[02:30:00.396 --> 02:30:02.518]  What did he tell you, Anthony Gucciardi?
[02:30:03.712 --> 02:30:04.332]  Turn his mic on, thanks.
[02:30:04.352 --> 02:30:07.074]  The doctor we just spoke to called me... Start over, go ahead.
[02:30:07.454 --> 02:30:11.075]  The doctor we just spoke to was the one who called me freaking out, saying the CEO called him.
[02:30:11.115 --> 02:30:14.977]  They were getting thousands of calls to their medical center freaking out about Ebola.
[02:30:14.997 --> 02:30:16.958]  Of course, that's what America would do is call the wrong hospital.
[02:30:16.998 --> 02:30:17.698]  Two key facts.
[02:30:17.738 --> 02:30:25.962]  Number one, I was the one who also spoke to a close friend of mine who, if he were to come on air right now and explain what he saw to me, and if he actually went public with it, it would be over.
[02:30:26.402 --> 02:30:28.003]  It would be international news immediately.
[02:30:28.363 --> 02:30:30.264]  We're talking about someone that runs multiple hospitals.
[02:30:30.544 --> 02:30:32.045]  That flies around helicopters.
[02:30:32.065 --> 02:30:34.967]  But do you see why he's so afraid now to go on air?
[02:30:35.307 --> 02:30:41.551]  Because, unfortunately, they know, oh, people won't get it, and they'll go crazy, and everyone will go after him.
[02:30:41.811 --> 02:30:42.872]  They won't be thankful for him.
[02:30:42.912 --> 02:30:43.693]  They'll go after him.
[02:30:44.473 --> 02:30:46.855]  So you're not even allowed now to go out and say common sense.
[02:30:46.915 --> 02:30:50.717]  If we let people with Ebola get on planes and fly here, we might get Ebola.
[02:30:51.097 --> 02:30:57.902]  You know, we can't even go on that now because he's afraid he'll lose his medical license if he goes and speaks to the fact that, yes, he's seen potential Ebola patients.
[02:30:57.922 --> 02:30:58.342]  Stay there.
[02:30:58.382 --> 02:30:58.742]  Stay there.
[02:30:58.762 --> 02:30:59.483]  We're on the march.
[02:31:00.103 --> 02:31:00.924]  Stay there.
[02:31:01.024 --> 02:31:01.764]  I'll be back.
[02:31:02.665 --> 02:31:04.967]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Nippon.
[02:31:04.987 --> 02:31:07.248]  It's Truman Lakewood that the report came from.
[02:31:07.308 --> 02:31:08.389]  Truman Lakewood.
[02:31:09.430 --> 02:31:16.495]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:31:16.575 --> 02:31:18.736]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:31:18.917 --> 02:31:24.020]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:31:24.200 --> 02:31:29.164]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:31:29.364 --> 02:31:32.427]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:31:32.687 --> 02:31:36.551]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:31:36.771 --> 02:31:40.995]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:31:41.096 --> 02:31:51.105]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:31:51.325 --> 02:31:53.848]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:31:54.028 --> 02:32:02.080]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:32:02.240 --> 02:32:06.205]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:32:09.386 --> 02:32:11.027]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[02:32:11.367 --> 02:32:15.148]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[02:32:15.889 --> 02:32:20.230]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[02:32:20.350 --> 02:32:27.153]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[02:32:27.673 --> 02:32:36.737]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:32:36.957 --> 02:32:42.400]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[02:32:42.501 --> 02:32:49.765]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.
[02:32:50.085 --> 02:32:52.387]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:32:52.667 --> 02:32:57.790]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.

[02:33:06.037 --> 02:33:08.138]  DNA Force from Infowarslife.
[02:33:09.740 --> 02:33:15.144]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:33:16.405 --> 02:33:21.149]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:33:21.529 --> 02:33:23.010]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[02:33:25.612 --> 02:33:28.314]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:33:30.255 --> 02:33:32.376]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:33:34.317 --> 02:33:36.598]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:33:36.618 --> 02:33:42.642]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:33:43.342 --> 02:33:46.084]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[02:33:48.400 --> 02:33:50.282]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:33:50.542 --> 02:33:52.063]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:33:52.323 --> 02:33:54.886]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:33:55.206 --> 02:33:59.249]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[02:33:59.269 --> 02:34:01.471]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:34:01.852 --> 02:34:04.053]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:34:04.554 --> 02:34:05.975]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:34:06.135 --> 02:34:06.576]  Got it.
[02:34:06.916 --> 02:34:07.717]  Others don't.
[02:34:29.802 --> 02:34:34.746]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:34:34.766 --> 02:34:39.810]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:34:39.850 --> 02:34:41.031]  Shooter Jennings bringing us in.
[02:34:42.987 --> 02:34:46.668]  We're going to go to Ben, Jeff, Frank, who's a physician, and others.
[02:34:46.708 --> 02:34:51.909]  We've got Dan Dix of Press for Truth up there in Ottawa, the capital of Canada.
[02:34:51.949 --> 02:34:53.249]  Their parliament is in the background.
[02:34:53.589 --> 02:34:55.430]  We're going to go to him on the shooting yesterday.
[02:34:55.470 --> 02:34:56.390]  Could it be a false flag?
[02:34:56.410 --> 02:34:57.050]  I don't know.
[02:34:57.070 --> 02:35:01.211]  This guy looks like a useful idiot buffoon trying to commit suicide by terrorism.
[02:35:02.071 --> 02:35:05.732]  But we're going to get Dan Dix's take on that from the ground.
[02:35:05.772 --> 02:35:08.773]  He's a Canadian who lives up there and done a lot of reporting for us.
[02:35:09.213 --> 02:35:10.073]  But finishing up,
[02:35:11.443 --> 02:35:18.567]  We talked to a medical doctor that we know who manages a very large medical institution.
[02:35:18.587 --> 02:35:20.689]  I mean, it has a lot of hospitals.
[02:35:20.709 --> 02:35:21.849]  In fact, I don't want to say too much.
[02:35:21.889 --> 02:35:22.830]  We'll give it away in Texas.
[02:35:24.791 --> 02:35:29.374]  And Anthony, when we talked to him, said, hey, let us go public.
[02:35:29.414 --> 02:35:31.595]  And he said, quite frankly, the public won't understand it.
[02:35:31.615 --> 02:35:33.056]  It'll just come back on me.
[02:35:34.239 --> 02:35:34.499]  I don't
[02:35:53.161 --> 02:36:09.288]  Uh, from Cass Regional Medical Center, where they haven't had some suspicious cases, haven't had at Cass Regional Medical Center, and said the place where he did his residency, Truman Lakewood, he has people there, doctors, nurses, he knows, that are calling him, saying it looks like Ebola, acts like it, they just disappear in the people.
[02:36:09.508 --> 02:36:11.228]  Well, that's what the Border Patrol's telling us.
[02:36:11.689 --> 02:36:15.830]  We have that article, former Border Patrol agent, CDC, disappearing potential Ebola victims.
[02:36:16.050 --> 02:36:17.071]  That's from October 10th.
[02:36:17.671 --> 02:36:22.373]  So we're getting it from Border Patrol, current, former, medical doctors, other medical doctors.
[02:36:23.678 --> 02:36:25.724]  And so that's what we're talking about.
[02:36:25.744 --> 02:36:30.418]  So before we go to press for truth and shift gears and back into calls.
[02:36:31.825 --> 02:36:35.147]  Explain what this medical doctor that we know very well told us.
[02:36:35.647 --> 02:36:36.867]  Sure, and he's not a listener.
[02:36:36.947 --> 02:36:40.769]  He doesn't, you know, actually really get himself involved with all this information.
[02:36:40.789 --> 02:36:41.649]  We just know him separately.
[02:36:41.969 --> 02:36:48.392]  Exactly, and also coincides with what the Border Patrol's saying, with what Dr. Group's saying about a Las Vegas conference of other medical doctors.
[02:36:48.452 --> 02:36:49.272]  It's all the same thing.
[02:36:49.633 --> 02:36:55.515]  Basically, he was telling me, as James was, they just classify it as malaria and disappear people.
[02:36:55.675 --> 02:37:02.002]  Or specifically someone walks in with what looks like Ebola and oftentimes the hospitals and the nurses don't want to deal with it.
[02:37:02.463 --> 02:37:05.306]  And the nurses, one of his nurses was telling me she's going to quit her job.
[02:37:05.666 --> 02:37:06.487]  She hates people.
[02:37:06.527 --> 02:37:07.508]  She hates dealing with them.
[02:37:07.588 --> 02:37:11.012]  She doesn't want her family get Ebola because of these people and she can't handle it.
[02:37:11.032 --> 02:37:11.873]  Man, this is social.
[02:37:11.893 --> 02:37:13.435]  This is you hanging out with some of the nurses.
[02:37:13.495 --> 02:37:13.615]  Yeah.
[02:37:13.715 --> 02:37:18.499]  This was, uh, I'm not even going to go into too much detail, but anyway, this type of nurse is someone who would deal with Ebola patients.
[02:37:18.919 --> 02:37:21.602]  And she was talking about how everyone is aware.
[02:37:21.722 --> 02:37:23.103]  And Paul Watson was there as well.
[02:37:23.123 --> 02:37:24.044]  Paul Watson was there as well.
[02:37:24.524 --> 02:37:27.727]  Everyone in the medical community in Dallas is fully aware of it.
[02:37:28.047 --> 02:37:28.748]  It's a big joke.
[02:37:28.808 --> 02:37:30.149]  The CDC gives them nothing.
[02:37:30.189 --> 02:37:31.490]  We're going to say the city, it's Dallas.
[02:37:31.730 --> 02:37:32.370]  It's Dallas.
[02:37:32.831 --> 02:37:34.691]  And there's hospitals in other regions as well.
[02:37:34.711 --> 02:37:36.472]  But anyway, it's a big joke up there.
[02:37:36.512 --> 02:37:38.493]  The CDC doesn't give them enough preparation.
[02:37:38.874 --> 02:37:44.997]  They know that there are Ebola cases going around, or at least suspected Ebola cases, what looks like Ebola, and they classify it as malaria.
[02:37:45.177 --> 02:37:49.879]  Or the CDC comes in, and this is what the doctor was telling me, the CDC comes in and basically takes it over.
[02:37:50.479 --> 02:37:53.981]  And then after that, it's under their jurisdiction and he doesn't have to deal with it anymore.
[02:37:54.321 --> 02:37:56.763]  And I said, why don't you come on air and at least just tell us some of that.
[02:37:56.783 --> 02:37:58.465]  And he goes, no, no.
[02:37:58.485 --> 02:38:00.526]  He said, maybe if you let me use a voice changer.
[02:38:00.546 --> 02:38:01.427]  But then he even said no.
[02:38:01.487 --> 02:38:02.168]  He said, you know why?
[02:38:02.428 --> 02:38:03.549]  Because it won't help.
[02:38:03.689 --> 02:38:06.471]  They'll actually come after me and everyone will hate me for doing so.
[02:38:06.732 --> 02:38:08.333]  They'll say he has it or something.
[02:38:08.373 --> 02:38:09.334]  Or Martians were there.
[02:38:09.354 --> 02:38:10.095]  They'll say his hospital.
[02:38:10.135 --> 02:38:11.836]  I mean, we're just reporting on what's known.
[02:38:11.856 --> 02:38:13.057]  They're telling cops cover it up.
[02:38:13.217 --> 02:38:14.198]  They're telling firefighters.
[02:38:14.218 --> 02:38:15.539]  We got the Border Patrol warning us.
[02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:16.640]  It's confirmed.
[02:38:16.980 --> 02:38:18.402]  There's suspicious stuff going on.
[02:38:18.582 --> 02:38:19.803]  And who cares they're disappearing people.
[02:38:20.063 --> 02:38:24.006]  It's all the fault of this American doctor who dared stick his head up.
[02:38:24.306 --> 02:38:25.007]  It's all his fault.
[02:38:25.227 --> 02:38:25.847]  It's a big joke.
[02:38:26.648 --> 02:38:29.450]  And then the whole thing is, why are we even debating this?
[02:38:29.510 --> 02:38:34.474]  Because they're flying people over with Ebola into the United States and then letting nurses run around.
[02:38:34.854 --> 02:38:41.379]  Even though they admit it takes 56 days for some people with healthy immune systems to incubate Ebola, they're letting them out after 21 days in quarantine.
[02:38:41.459 --> 02:38:43.020]  And they're telling them, oh, you're sick?
[02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:43.940]  You treated Ebola patients?
[02:38:43.960 --> 02:38:45.161]  Go ahead and fly, Cupcake.
[02:38:45.241 --> 02:38:46.041]  Go to a major city.
[02:38:46.081 --> 02:38:46.461]  It's fine.
[02:38:46.481 --> 02:38:47.202]  Everything will be okay.
[02:38:47.422 --> 02:38:48.702]  So these doctors know it's a big joke.
[02:38:48.722 --> 02:38:49.363]  They're not idiots.
[02:38:49.423 --> 02:38:53.405]  I mean, these top doctors running these hospitals, they don't need to even look at the news.
[02:38:53.425 --> 02:38:59.908]  They say, well, yeah, they're letting nurses out who treated an Ebola patient, when those are the only ones now openly getting Ebola.
[02:38:59.988 --> 02:39:01.188]  Let them go to a major city.
[02:39:01.408 --> 02:39:03.630]  Gee, I wonder if we're going to have Ebola cases.
[02:39:03.910 --> 02:39:10.753]  And that's why the doctors are all freaking out, because they're the ones that are the most informed about this, saying, well, am I even going to go to work anymore?
[02:39:10.913 --> 02:39:16.035]  And that's why the nurses, like he said, exactly the same thing I was told by my friend, the nurses are going to quit.
[02:39:16.415 --> 02:39:19.416]  The medical infrastructure is going to start leaving their jobs.
[02:39:19.436 --> 02:39:24.218]  Dr. Lorenzi is only saying what's already on their papers, that they're not being told and this is going on.
[02:39:24.599 --> 02:39:25.359]  But see, that's how bad it is.
[02:39:25.379 --> 02:39:29.020]  It's not the open borders, it's not the planes coming in, it's not the fact there's a cover-up going on.
[02:39:29.281 --> 02:39:35.663]  No, it's the fault that we would dare say, you know, this is going on, this needs to be investigated.
[02:39:36.383 --> 02:39:39.605]  This doctor says people are being disappeared at another hospital.
[02:39:40.663 --> 02:39:43.245]  The public can't even get it right and thinks it's his hospital.
[02:39:43.626 --> 02:39:44.386]  It's just, we're doomed.
[02:39:44.506 --> 02:39:45.807]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[02:39:46.868 --> 02:39:48.890]  I apologize that we're telling you this is going on.
[02:39:48.910 --> 02:39:49.691]  It's all my fault.
[02:39:49.711 --> 02:39:53.614]  It's like if there's a giant sinkhole and everyone is standing around the sinkhole saying, look, there's a sinkhole.
[02:39:53.634 --> 02:39:56.176]  And we go in there and we say, look, there's a giant sinkhole downtown.
[02:39:56.616 --> 02:39:59.819]  And then everyone's like, oh my God, there's a sinkhole in Florida?
[02:40:00.419 --> 02:40:02.201]  Or you saw dinosaurs eating people?
[02:40:03.582 --> 02:40:05.404]  Yeah, or how do you know there's a sinkhole?
[02:40:05.444 --> 02:40:09.528]  Well, every single person saw the sinkhole and is talking about it, and I'm getting calls about it in pictures everywhere.
[02:40:09.789 --> 02:40:11.130]  Well, there's no sinkhole.
[02:40:11.190 --> 02:40:13.252]  It must be on the moon or something.
[02:40:13.472 --> 02:40:14.033]  It's not hard to find.
[02:40:14.213 --> 02:40:18.758]  Obviously, they say no one that's got in contact with Gattabola but two nurses in gear.
[02:40:19.279 --> 02:40:20.260]  Does anyone believe that?
[02:40:20.860 --> 02:40:21.881]  And then the nurses left.
[02:40:22.702 --> 02:40:24.804]  And then the nurses are sick flying around.
[02:40:24.824 --> 02:40:27.806]  It is comical after a while, when you think about it.
[02:40:28.126 --> 02:40:35.772]  What's really comical is the news media now saying Ebola is fine, it was only one guy that had it, everything's okay, nothing is happening.
[02:40:35.792 --> 02:40:38.053]  You notice they don't even have news articles about Ebola anymore.
[02:40:38.574 --> 02:40:39.615]  They only have talking points.
[02:40:39.935 --> 02:40:43.918]  And the czar doesn't even show up to the meetings and says there's too many black people in Africa.
[02:40:44.278 --> 02:40:44.438]  Yeah.
[02:40:44.698 --> 02:40:45.539]  You can't make this up.
[02:40:45.839 --> 02:40:49.760]  No, I mean, I'm wondering who called CNN and others and said, hey, stop talking about this.
[02:40:50.261 --> 02:40:54.362]  Because it went from them freaking out about it, like with actual nurses, like the L.A.
[02:40:54.382 --> 02:41:06.127]  Times article where the nurses were like, yeah, the patient zero sat in the waiting room for four hours and we had no gear to treat him and he was brought in and we potentially contaminated the entire hazmat area.
[02:41:06.147 --> 02:41:10.229]  People are dying, vomiting on African flights out of areas ravaged on the plane.
[02:41:10.469 --> 02:41:11.970]  They don't even test and they just go, oh, it's not Ebola.
[02:41:12.270 --> 02:41:15.192]  And now they're like, no, no, it's okay, Ebola's not... Obvious cover-up!
[02:41:15.432 --> 02:41:17.694]  Does that mean all of these are going to be real Ebola cases?
[02:41:17.734 --> 02:41:18.254]  We don't know.
[02:41:18.274 --> 02:41:22.137]  I mean, there might not have been Ebola at the Truman Lakewood Medical Center.
[02:41:22.177 --> 02:41:23.578]  Probably wasn't, for all we know.
[02:41:23.978 --> 02:41:26.360]  The point is, is that their people are being whisked away.
[02:41:26.380 --> 02:41:29.042]  I hope if I get whisked away, there's an investigation, Anthony.
[02:41:29.062 --> 02:41:29.903]  Well, how dare we ask?
[02:41:30.860 --> 02:41:31.301]  I mean, no.
[02:41:32.001 --> 02:41:35.945]  With top Border Patrol people saying, yeah, there's people with potential Ebola symptoms.
[02:41:35.985 --> 02:41:36.445]  Disappeared.
[02:41:36.525 --> 02:41:37.146]  Disappeared.
[02:41:37.446 --> 02:41:39.488]  And then doctors, independently.
[02:41:39.568 --> 02:41:41.509]  Again, these are not people that listen to the show.
[02:41:41.670 --> 02:41:42.891]  Coming up to me, just talking about it.
[02:41:42.911 --> 02:41:44.312]  This is people that we hang out with.
[02:41:44.432 --> 02:41:45.233]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:41:45.273 --> 02:41:48.155]  This is someone that's... This is people we go out on boats with, socially.
[02:41:48.175 --> 02:41:52.099]  That we go, you know, sports, golf, you know, you name it.
[02:41:52.679 --> 02:41:53.860]  I mean, you date some of the nurses.
[02:41:54.040 --> 02:41:55.742]  And what's sad... It's a very horrible job.
[02:41:55.782 --> 02:41:56.462]  It's a horrible life.
[02:41:56.742 --> 02:42:00.125]  What's really sad is they're not even freaking out.
[02:42:00.145 --> 02:42:01.606]  He's not even saying, like, oh my God, it's Ebola.
[02:42:01.626 --> 02:42:05.830]  He's just like, yes, there's probably Ebola in many hospitals and we're probably going to have to deal with it.
[02:42:05.850 --> 02:42:07.992]  The CDC is inept and we don't know what to do.
[02:42:08.552 --> 02:42:09.753]  It's not like he's freaking out.
[02:42:10.073 --> 02:42:11.454]  And then I'm like, well, you should be freaking out.
[02:42:11.474 --> 02:42:13.576]  He's like, well, you know, it's happening.
[02:42:13.676 --> 02:42:18.240]  When they don't close off the borders to infected countries and they come over, it's probably going to happen.
[02:42:18.720 --> 02:42:20.182]  He's just matter-of-factly stating it.
[02:42:20.822 --> 02:42:23.864]  But no, but he was also saying that they've got the reports of him whisking away.
[02:42:24.084 --> 02:42:27.266]  Oh, of course, yeah, because they disappear them and they can't find them in the medical records anymore.
[02:42:27.767 --> 02:42:29.488]  Just like he said, that's what is freaking me out.
[02:42:29.588 --> 02:42:30.929]  And no one seems to care.
[02:42:30.969 --> 02:42:34.151]  What freaks me out the most is they're independently saying all of these things.
[02:42:34.191 --> 02:42:35.652]  Same with him saying the nurses are going to quit.
[02:42:36.012 --> 02:42:37.793]  They go and look it up in the medical records system.
[02:42:37.833 --> 02:42:38.694]  It's not there anymore.
[02:42:38.974 --> 02:42:40.215]  This is over and over again.
[02:42:40.275 --> 02:42:41.576]  And they're not they don't know each other.
[02:42:41.596 --> 02:42:43.197]  This is a guy from up near Kansas City.
[02:42:43.257 --> 02:42:44.918]  And this is someone from in Texas.
[02:42:45.794 --> 02:42:51.099]  This is completely different areas, and they're finding the same thing, and they just say it's malaria, and they're like, well, the symptoms are completely different.
[02:42:51.119 --> 02:42:55.743]  They're bleeding out of their behind, and they're urinating blood, and they're like, well, that's okay.
[02:42:55.983 --> 02:42:58.725]  The CDC will come in and determine it, and then it's just nothing.
[02:42:59.986 --> 02:43:00.367]  Every time.
[02:43:00.647 --> 02:43:01.788]  Well, I just want to say bad job.
[02:43:02.654 --> 02:43:04.156]  There's no Ebola, everything's fine.
[02:43:04.857 --> 02:43:09.583]  We should go to Liberia to prove that we're not intolerant and that we want to keep the borders open.
[02:43:09.623 --> 02:43:13.168]  We should go to Liberia, no protection whatsoever, and everything will be fine.
[02:43:15.251 --> 02:43:16.633]  And cry like Kim Jong-un?
[02:43:16.673 --> 02:43:18.035]  Yeah, this is abortion.
[02:43:18.155 --> 02:43:18.636]  Kim Jong-un.
[02:43:19.196 --> 02:43:22.038]  Alright, I appreciate you Anthony, great job.
[02:43:22.058 --> 02:43:24.640]  We've got a bunch of articles going up on InfoWars.com.
[02:43:24.660 --> 02:43:33.886]  I want to apologize to our next guest here, ladies and gentlemen, because I ended up pushing him back today, but obviously he understands in news that happens.
[02:43:34.166 --> 02:43:41.992]  Dan Dix, Press for Truth, I think it's .ca, this says com, but great website, great investigative journalist, done a lot of investigative journalist work for us.
[02:43:42.652 --> 02:43:45.393]  And he's got the headline, What Happened in Ottawa, up on his site.
[02:43:45.413 --> 02:43:47.934]  We should post that article and that video.
[02:43:48.034 --> 02:43:51.315]  Dan, you're there in front of the Parliament where the shooting happened yesterday.
[02:43:51.735 --> 02:43:54.496]  You would have thought that Godzilla descended and was destroying the city.
[02:43:54.516 --> 02:43:57.737]  I know one man died and also the reported shooter died.
[02:43:58.338 --> 02:44:01.459]  We know that the Royal Mounted Police got caught a few years ago nearby.
[02:44:02.499 --> 02:44:04.781]  ...attacking themselves, dressed up as anarchists.
[02:44:04.801 --> 02:44:07.604]  They had to later admit that indeed that was a false flag.
[02:44:08.004 --> 02:44:11.367]  But this doesn't look like a false flag to me because it was so inept.
[02:44:11.687 --> 02:44:12.988]  He could only kill one person.
[02:44:13.248 --> 02:44:15.330]  He got killed by the sergeant-at-arms quickly.
[02:44:15.851 --> 02:44:16.451]  But who knows?
[02:44:16.511 --> 02:44:17.592]  Nowadays stuff's so fake.
[02:44:17.912 --> 02:44:19.554]  You live up there, Dan Dix.
[02:44:19.654 --> 02:44:21.896]  There's the Parliament right behind you.
[02:44:21.916 --> 02:44:23.137]  I see a lot of press there.
[02:44:23.617 --> 02:44:24.458]  What do you think happened?
[02:44:25.347 --> 02:44:35.651]  Well, regardless of what happened, one thing I do know is that this is going to completely change the political landscape here in Canada, simply because of the way that people are reacting to this.
[02:44:35.991 --> 02:44:44.615]  Now whether or not this was a false flag, or if this was an organic kind of rogue lash out, it still remains to be seen.
[02:44:45.035 --> 02:44:49.277]  But the bottom line is, we do have to be careful as Canadians about how we respond.
[02:44:49.677 --> 02:44:50.458]  To such a thing.
[02:44:50.818 --> 02:45:01.087]  I'm finding, I've interviewed a lot of people today and the general consensus is that everybody seems to be okay with the increase in a police state around here, so long as it keeps people safe.
[02:45:01.227 --> 02:45:06.071]  So, the media is already touting this as being an act of terrorism.
[02:45:06.411 --> 02:45:10.295]  There are newspapers all over the world saying terror has arrived here in Canada.
[02:45:10.755 --> 02:45:17.044]  Meanwhile, we don't even have all the facts in on this guy yet, but unfortunately the damage is done with headlines like that.
[02:45:17.064 --> 02:45:25.676]  It conditions the minds of the masses and the Canadian people to believe that there is a terrorist threat, and meanwhile we don't even know if this is true yet or not.
[02:45:27.262 --> 02:45:33.184]  Expanding on that, sometimes they have drills where they get somebody and then claim they're a Muslim convert and set them up like 7-7.
[02:45:33.784 --> 02:45:35.205]  We know that was a false flag.
[02:45:35.545 --> 02:45:38.766]  That's even come out, and I've had retired intelligence officers from England on about it.
[02:45:39.066 --> 02:45:40.146]  So we know they do this.
[02:45:40.207 --> 02:45:41.627]  The Romano police got caught.
[02:45:41.987 --> 02:45:43.228]  We wrote an article about it yesterday.
[02:45:43.248 --> 02:45:49.430]  They were all wearing the same boots, attacking police as a pretext to then attack the anti-WTO people and others.
[02:45:50.150 --> 02:45:53.991]  So we know this stuff goes on, but it could be some crazy, you know, person.
[02:45:54.031 --> 02:45:54.772]  But I agree with you.
[02:45:54.852 --> 02:45:55.672]  The response
[02:45:56.690 --> 02:45:58.151]  Give up your rights, you'll be safe.
[02:45:58.731 --> 02:46:01.393]  I mean, they were barricading stuff hours after he was dead.
[02:46:01.733 --> 02:46:08.377]  Just the panicking, the checkpoints, the guy strutting around behind you right now, kind of keeping an eye on you because you look so dangerous.
[02:46:08.777 --> 02:46:12.359]  I mean, how about they stop just letting all these people fly in unfettered?
[02:46:12.879 --> 02:46:13.720]  See, that's my issue.
[02:46:13.740 --> 02:46:15.581]  If you're going to have open immigration, do it.
[02:46:16.021 --> 02:46:22.063]  But then don't take everybody's rights acting like internally you can set up checkpoints randomly when the main borders are open.
[02:46:22.403 --> 02:46:23.663]  It's clearly a power grab.
[02:46:23.923 --> 02:46:25.404]  Look at our government funding ISIS.
[02:46:25.764 --> 02:46:34.066]  I wonder how the Syrians, like 300,000 people, getting murdered the last four years by Western-backed jihadis that this guy, they claim, was connected to.
[02:46:34.426 --> 02:46:39.227]  I mean, what's going to happen when ISIS does come over here and blow up schools or attack police stations?
[02:46:39.407 --> 02:46:40.708]  I'm not giving my rights up.
[02:46:42.035 --> 02:46:45.758]  You know, because they use Stinger missiles to blow planes out of the sky that our government gave them, Dan.
[02:46:46.418 --> 02:46:52.702]  Well, I'll tell you, Alex, they've been conditioning us to be afraid and to accept these draconian measures.
[02:46:53.702 --> 02:47:09.052]  I put together a video called Conditioning Canadians on the War on Terror, and if people want to see that, it's available at PressForTruth.ca, and in it, we extensively document, over the last six or seven years, all the various amounts of conditioning
[02:47:09.492 --> 02:47:29.769]  And setups that CSIS, the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service, and the RCMP have been involved in, when sometimes it may just be coercing an informant, setting these guys up and incubating them and allowing some sort of attack to happen once they have become radicalized through
[02:47:30.169 --> 02:47:31.450]  The intelligence communities.
[02:47:32.190 --> 02:47:44.778]  So we documented that extensively and how over the last six years, there's been heavy conditioning here in Canada to basically, you know, as soon as something happens here, the first thing everybody thinks is terrorists.
[02:47:44.858 --> 02:47:46.099]  It must be terrorists.
[02:47:46.379 --> 02:47:52.223]  And they've been setting this up for quite some time now, trying to link these guys with the Islamic State, ISIS.
[02:47:52.403 --> 02:47:57.827]  As you may know, Stephen Harper recently sent a whole fleet of F-18 fighter
[02:47:58.527 --> 02:48:00.589]  That's right, and ISIS said they would then attack Canada.
[02:48:00.609 --> 02:48:01.049]  Remember that?
[02:48:01.930 --> 02:48:02.891]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:48:03.051 --> 02:48:06.334]  So now, as you said, is this a case of retaliation?
[02:48:06.495 --> 02:48:07.816]  Is this a rogue nut?
[02:48:07.896 --> 02:48:12.060]  Is this an all-out false flag, which it very well could be as well?
[02:48:12.120 --> 02:48:14.102]  Remains to be seen.
[02:48:15.003 --> 02:48:17.465]  But again, we simply just can't
[02:48:18.223 --> 02:48:27.128]  Rush into bombing other countries and removing all the rights of the Canadian people here because of this tragic incident.
[02:48:27.228 --> 02:48:31.571]  Well, I mean, in the old days, if a couple of people got shot, they'd find out who was responsible and bring them to justice.
[02:48:31.631 --> 02:48:33.632]  Everybody wouldn't roll around in total fear.
[02:48:33.692 --> 02:48:39.695]  They used to send one Texas Ranger to take on, like, a hundred people, and they'd say, you know, why'd they only send one?
[02:48:39.716 --> 02:48:47.160]  Well, that's because all we need to get into this mode of just guys with machine guns everywhere running around hysterical like a beehive.
[02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:52.783]  When only two people got killed, it just looks like total drama queen behavior.
[02:48:52.803 --> 02:48:54.044]  It looks pretty cowardly to me.
[02:48:54.324 --> 02:48:59.487]  And again, I'm just saying, compared to the way people used to act anywhere, this is not how you project strength.
[02:48:59.967 --> 02:49:02.489]  Is the barricading, the freaking out, the hyperventilating.
[02:49:02.789 --> 02:49:05.570]  It looked like the Ayatollah Khomeini walked by earlier.
[02:49:05.971 --> 02:49:06.691]  Who were those folks?
[02:49:06.711 --> 02:49:08.312]  Did you see those guys look like Iranians?
[02:49:09.312 --> 02:49:11.153]  Yeah, a number of people are still here.
[02:49:11.613 --> 02:49:17.376]  If you want, I can walk you through here and give you a bit of a look at what the scene really is like here.
[02:49:17.456 --> 02:49:20.537]  I mean, there is a lot of media around right now doing interviews.
[02:49:20.898 --> 02:49:23.279]  This is pretty much the front of the gate.
[02:49:23.339 --> 02:49:27.861]  This is the memorial that is just being set up for the fallen soldiers.
[02:49:27.881 --> 02:49:34.604]  So people have been coming here all day today paying their respects and a lot of media, a lot of other kind of groups here.
[02:49:36.763 --> 02:49:38.164]  Yeah, those guys though, I'm not sure.
[02:49:38.544 --> 02:49:43.406]  They just walked up, but as soon as I'm done here, I'm going to try to interview some of those guys.
[02:49:43.747 --> 02:49:45.327]  Well, it is a tragedy for the soldier.
[02:49:45.347 --> 02:49:47.269]  He's just sitting there on honor guard.
[02:49:47.329 --> 02:49:48.949]  Somebody walks up and shoots him repeatedly.
[02:49:48.969 --> 02:49:52.011]  I've just seen a lot of witnesses that say they saw it.
[02:49:52.031 --> 02:49:53.412]  It looked pretty credible.
[02:49:53.852 --> 02:49:55.053]  It could be a false flag.
[02:49:55.493 --> 02:49:58.936]  It's that FBI tactic even the New York Times reported on.
[02:49:59.217 --> 02:50:05.842]  Out of 100 bombing plots in the U.S., it turned out 97, I think, were hatched by the FBI, if you read the report.
[02:50:06.283 --> 02:50:07.884]  This is a very dangerous precedent.
[02:50:09.545 --> 02:50:11.107]  I just don't think we can trust what we're being told.
[02:50:11.883 --> 02:50:23.606]  Well, you know, Alex, it's come out that the soldier was armed with the gun, but it turns out the gun is not loaded, and they never are, and of course, it's gonna bring up... Ridiculous.
[02:50:24.842 --> 02:50:25.562]  Of course it is.
[02:50:25.762 --> 02:50:29.946]  What's the point of having a soldier on guard if he is not armed?
[02:50:29.966 --> 02:50:35.611]  And of course, we don't know yet what kind of a weapon or all we know is this is a long gun that was used.
[02:50:35.731 --> 02:50:36.872]  Yeah, there is no way.
[02:50:36.952 --> 02:50:47.642]  It looks like a .243 or a .30-30 or something, but continuing here, imagine being on guard duty at a parliament and you don't have a loaded gun.
[02:50:48.143 --> 02:50:49.184]  It's a major target.
[02:50:50.144 --> 02:50:50.525]  Yeah.
[02:50:50.545 --> 02:50:51.525]  This is just ridiculous.
[02:50:52.166 --> 02:50:56.289]  And I mean, why government has all this police state and they can't protect the Parliament?
[02:50:56.369 --> 02:50:57.310]  I mean, that is ridiculous.
[02:50:58.391 --> 02:50:59.272]  Yeah, that's just it.
[02:50:59.312 --> 02:51:04.075]  I mean, apparently this guy walks up to the soldier and he shoots him.
[02:51:04.496 --> 02:51:07.378]  He then manages to make his way a great deal.
[02:51:07.598 --> 02:51:08.179]  I can show you.
[02:51:08.279 --> 02:51:13.202]  Here is the monument and Parliament building is all the way over there.
[02:51:13.222 --> 02:51:14.984]  It's like 300 yards.
[02:51:15.044 --> 02:51:15.404]  I've been there.
[02:51:15.424 --> 02:51:15.865]  It's about 300 yards.
[02:51:16.570 --> 02:51:20.072]  Yeah, yeah, I mean, it is, yeah.
[02:51:20.272 --> 02:51:31.018]  And he managed to go from there into the Parliament building where there are security checks to get by, there are metal detectors, there are security guards you've got to get by.
[02:51:34.220 --> 02:51:35.681]  Yeah, so he managed to get through.
[02:51:35.701 --> 02:51:38.102]  Why was it the Sergeant of Arms that shot him?
[02:51:38.142 --> 02:51:43.766]  I mean, that the Sergeant of Arms out of probably 100 security people would be the person to shoot him.
[02:51:44.206 --> 02:51:45.707]  Maybe the security isn't allowed to have guns?
[02:51:47.174 --> 02:51:56.585]  Um, yeah, well, I do know that none of the footage inside of there actually has any clips of this guy.
[02:51:56.605 --> 02:51:58.847]  They can't seem to find any video of him.
[02:51:58.887 --> 02:51:59.928]  That sounds suspicious.
[02:51:59.969 --> 02:52:00.930]  Dan Dix, stay there.
[02:52:00.950 --> 02:52:05.595]  We're going to do some overdrive to talk to Jeff Frank, who's a physician, and Ben.
[02:52:06.095 --> 02:52:07.777]  This is a very important transmission today.
[02:52:07.797 --> 02:52:08.198]  Stay with us.
[02:52:09.597 --> 02:52:14.120]  I'm watching and waiting for the right time to take everything you own.
[02:52:14.520 --> 02:52:15.721]  I love a dark house.
[02:52:16.061 --> 02:52:18.083]  Don't be the next victim of a break-in.
[02:52:18.163 --> 02:52:26.629]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone is inside watching TV and makes your home unappealing to would-be thieves.
[02:52:26.849 --> 02:52:28.150]  Don't these people ever leave?
[02:52:28.250 --> 02:52:31.092]  Starting at $24.95 and there's free shipping.
[02:52:31.312 --> 02:52:35.895]  Go to Faketv.com or ask for it at your local hardware store.
[02:52:36.295 --> 02:52:38.437]  Faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[02:52:39.653 --> 02:52:40.454]  This is Dan Pilla.
[02:52:40.474 --> 02:52:41.955]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:52:42.255 --> 02:52:43.556]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:52:43.916 --> 02:52:46.238]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:52:46.738 --> 02:52:48.600]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:52:49.020 --> 02:52:53.083]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[02:52:53.543 --> 02:52:57.246]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[02:52:57.486 --> 02:53:00.929]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[02:53:01.249 --> 02:53:01.669]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[02:53:01.689 --> 02:53:03.310]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[02:53:08.601 --> 02:53:09.582]  The experts are clear.
[02:53:09.922 --> 02:53:16.867]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[02:53:17.027 --> 02:53:23.271]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[02:53:23.291 --> 02:53:26.894]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[02:53:27.014 --> 02:53:30.917]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[02:53:31.237 --> 02:53:36.281]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:53:36.561 --> 02:53:37.442]  Not our iodine.
[02:53:37.562 --> 02:53:41.144]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[02:53:41.384 --> 02:53:43.726]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[02:54:37.725 --> 02:54:46.991]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:54:47.031 --> 02:54:47.771]  This capitalism?
[02:54:47.831 --> 02:54:53.935]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:54:53.995 --> 02:54:57.637]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[02:54:57.697 --> 02:54:58.618]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:54:58.638 --> 02:54:59.658]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:54:59.698 --> 02:54:59.959]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:55:00.019 --> 02:55:00.359]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:55:29.002 --> 02:55:34.250]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's Silver Bullet, Colloidal Silver, or Survival Shield Super Nascent Iodine X2,
[02:55:36.249 --> 02:55:46.215]  We have the highest quality known systems out there that I believe from the research we've done, and I personally have experienced it, boost my health and well-being and bolsters my natural defenses.
[02:55:46.816 --> 02:55:59.464]  Oxy-Powder, DNA Force, Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality, it's all available at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:56:04.367 --> 02:56:19.855]  And the DNA force, as nutraceutical level, Bio-PQQ, CoQ10, and a bunch of other things, I mean just one of these ingredients, is equivalent of, the group was saying, and he showed me the equations, of 500 little crates of blueberries.
[02:56:20.575 --> 02:56:23.477]  So it's beyond vitamin C. It is just, it's just amazing.
[02:56:23.937 --> 02:56:27.039]  We can even make claims on it that are on the site, because it's patented.
[02:56:27.898 --> 02:56:31.180]  A bunch of the ingredients are patented and have literally hundreds of studies behind them.
[02:56:31.460 --> 02:56:32.760]  Go watch the informational videos.
[02:56:32.820 --> 02:56:37.743]  Read about DNA Force at Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:56:38.663 --> 02:56:50.469]  And again, your purchase of the Molon Labe t-shirts, the books, the films, all of it, funds our operations so we can fearlessly try to break down the latest.
[02:56:50.529 --> 02:56:55.351]  Oh, there's a new camouflage Molon Labe shirt in that I think gives the others a run for their money.
[02:56:55.391 --> 02:56:57.072]  Long sleeve for the winner.
[02:56:57.572 --> 02:56:58.553]  I'm going to be wearing mine.
[02:56:58.593 --> 02:56:59.773]  In fact, they just came in today.
[02:56:59.793 --> 02:57:00.834]  I noticed it's up on the side.
[02:57:01.334 --> 02:57:02.435]  I couldn't wait until this came in.
[02:57:02.495 --> 02:57:04.556]  It's got that high-tech camo pattern to it.
[02:57:05.176 --> 02:57:07.818]  So, InfowarsStore.com or MadeIn1776.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:57:07.858 --> 02:57:09.659]  DanDickSuppressForTruth.ca or .tv.
[02:57:17.003 --> 02:57:18.285]  Uh, is our guest.
[02:57:18.305 --> 02:57:19.667]  A lot of his films are on his site.
[02:57:20.047 --> 02:57:26.556]  I'm going to go into some overdrive and talk to, uh, Frank, who's a California physician, Jeff, a firefighter, and EnviroTech specialist.
[02:57:26.817 --> 02:57:27.998]  Appreciate you guys holding.
[02:57:28.018 --> 02:57:31.863]  Uh, but in a few minutes we've got left, Dan, I want to invite you on the nightly news.
[02:57:32.884 --> 02:57:38.008]  There, if they can tape some of that with you for later tonight, so you can expand on the amazing reporting you're doing.
[02:57:38.408 --> 02:57:47.634]  But in the few minutes we've got left, other points you'd like to make from the scene of the battle for Ottawa, as it's being called, greater than the Nazi blitz on London.
[02:57:48.635 --> 02:57:56.520]  Everyone rolling around on the ground in fear, begging for Big Brother to watch everything they do to keep them safe from ISIS that the Canadian government's been part of arming.
[02:57:57.426 --> 02:58:16.234]  Well, Alex, I would just beg people not to fear their governments, not to fear this Islamic State, and to realize that this is indeed about getting us into going along with some of these plans that they have for Canadians.
[02:58:16.295 --> 02:58:21.457]  So, I just want to encourage Canadians to remember that we just can't
[02:58:22.137 --> 02:58:29.881]  Simply just jump all over this and listen to what the mainstream media is reporting because they're doing a very shoddy job, I must say.
[02:58:30.581 --> 02:58:35.603]  So that's why we just decided to come down here and get on the grounds and try to get to the bottom of what's going on.
[02:58:36.024 --> 02:58:40.886]  If this does indeed turn out to be a false flag, if we find out this guy was on SSRI drugs or
[02:58:41.506 --> 02:58:43.788]  Or he was involved in the military.
[02:58:43.928 --> 02:58:45.369]  All these things will come out.
[02:58:45.749 --> 02:58:47.991]  But remember, they're already calling it terrorism.
[02:58:48.191 --> 02:58:51.233]  Do not be afraid of terrorism here in Canada.
[02:58:51.334 --> 02:58:56.878]  And if it does, always remember folks that suspect number one is definitely the state.
[02:58:57.458 --> 02:59:01.263]  Because that's who stands to gain in the power grab and has been caught doing it over and over again.
[02:59:01.283 --> 02:59:05.128]  And I love how they were aiming guns at reporters yesterday and saying, don't report.
[02:59:05.188 --> 02:59:09.653]  And there's a security guard or cop keeps walking around giving you the eye.
[02:59:09.673 --> 02:59:12.396]  I mean, because you're just so suspicious, Dan.
[02:59:13.017 --> 02:59:13.738]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:59:13.798 --> 02:59:15.901]  Well, I guess we're sometimes.
[02:59:16.596 --> 02:59:22.019]  Perhaps considered the enemy in these types of environments, so I'll have to be careful out here, Alex.
[02:59:22.640 --> 02:59:28.383]  Now, the parliament is a beautiful neo-gothic construction built, I guess, about a hundred years ago.
[02:59:28.403 --> 02:59:31.585]  I spent hours looking at it when I was there a few years ago.
[02:59:32.205 --> 02:59:32.925]  I got video.
[02:59:32.945 --> 02:59:37.646]  I remember you and I walked around just discussing all the occult symbolism on that building.
[02:59:37.706 --> 02:59:41.628]  I have videos of that on my YouTube channel, youtube.com slash Weaving Spider.
[02:59:42.488 --> 02:59:45.669]  It's back in 2006 now, quite some time ago.
[02:59:46.149 --> 02:59:48.069]  Dan, we gotta have you back on the nightly news.
[02:59:48.109 --> 02:59:49.350]  Yeah, it's just so occultic.
[02:59:49.650 --> 02:59:51.070]  They admit that they wear rituals in there.
[02:59:51.090 --> 02:59:53.171]  I was gonna ask, are you able to get near the building?
[02:59:53.831 --> 02:59:55.791]  This is as close as I can get right now.
[02:59:56.111 --> 02:59:57.172]  Alright, we'll talk to you soon.
[02:59:57.192 --> 02:59:58.092]  We'll come back in overdrive.
[02:59:59.474 --> 03:00:00.694]  Another major health threat.
[03:00:00.734 --> 03:00:05.636]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[03:00:05.696 --> 03:00:08.357]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[03:00:08.397 --> 03:00:15.159]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[03:00:15.419 --> 03:00:18.280]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[03:00:18.400 --> 03:00:21.361]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[03:00:21.441 --> 03:00:23.362]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[03:00:23.382 --> 03:00:26.243]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[03:00:26.323 --> 03:00:31.825]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[03:00:32.045 --> 03:00:35.527]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[03:00:35.547 --> 03:00:38.528]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[03:00:38.648 --> 03:00:45.731]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[03:00:45.951 --> 03:00:49.012]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[03:00:56.236 --> 03:00:57.277]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:01:15.339 --> 03:01:19.500]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:01:20.181 --> 03:01:20.981]  You want answers?
[03:01:21.761 --> 03:01:22.641]  Well, so does he.
[03:01:23.301 --> 03:01:26.943]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:01:27.503 --> 03:01:31.544]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:01:38.061 --> 03:01:39.002]  Alright, final segment.
[03:01:39.022 --> 03:01:41.585]  I want to thank Frank, a physician, for holding for 30 minutes.
[03:01:41.885 --> 03:01:43.987]  We'll go to Jeff, who's been holding for an hour, a firefighter.
[03:01:44.648 --> 03:01:47.230]  Frank, your take on the Ebola situation?
[03:01:47.270 --> 03:01:52.015]  Medical doctors telling us they see what they believe is Ebola cases, and then people are disappearing.
[03:01:54.433 --> 03:01:58.274]  Great show, Mr. Alex.
[03:01:58.294 --> 03:02:15.320]  I would not be surprised at that, but my take on it is, I'm thinking that if this virus, that if it was Ebola, is mutating, you need to get samples if you're going to make a vaccine off of it, so you can have the latest and greatest.
[03:02:16.641 --> 03:02:19.824]  The other thing is, I think I sent you a show a couple of weeks ago.
[03:02:19.844 --> 03:02:38.503]  I was also the family practice and hyperbaric physician and I think I sent you some information regarding something that came out actually last October in 2013 from a journal of virology where it said the hemoxygenase 1 enzyme actually stops the Ebola virus replication.
[03:02:39.432 --> 03:03:02.162]  And, you know, I would say I've been a little bit consumed with this, and so, you know, with my interest in hyperbarics, since that is a subspecialty of mine, I actually found that if you put yourself in a chamber, you're actually, and this is all documented, this is research that's out there, I think your staff might have it, it shows that if you go in a chamber, a hyperbaric chamber, you're actually upregulating your hemoxygenase 1.
[03:03:03.444 --> 03:03:13.127]  Well absolutely, Ebola can't live in oxygen and things, and I'm no doctor like you, but I've seen the medical literature about with viruses and other things going in hyperbaric chambers.
[03:03:13.147 --> 03:03:14.848]  That's what the Royal Family and others do.
[03:03:15.288 --> 03:03:18.409]  They also put their blood through different systems with UV light and things.
[03:03:19.489 --> 03:03:22.530]  Joel Skousen's daughter couldn't get rid of MRSA, knocked it out for her.
[03:03:23.610 --> 03:03:25.971]  You know, I couldn't get rid of a chest cold, my dad couldn't.
[03:03:26.951 --> 03:03:28.132]  Colloidal Silver knocked it out.
[03:03:28.172 --> 03:03:28.792]  I mean, it worked.
[03:03:29.232 --> 03:03:35.298]  I mean, I went with the antibiotics first, like a dummy, but it's just amazing.
[03:03:35.318 --> 03:03:36.098]  Thank you so much.
[03:03:36.459 --> 03:03:37.159]  Thanks for the call.
[03:03:37.480 --> 03:03:39.562]  Jeff in Indiana, you're on the air a firefighter.
[03:03:39.582 --> 03:03:40.523]  What's your take on this?
[03:03:42.104 --> 03:03:43.345]  Well, how you doing, Alex?
[03:03:43.385 --> 03:03:43.726]  Good, sir.
[03:03:44.687 --> 03:03:46.148]  Hey, I got real quick.
[03:03:46.628 --> 03:03:50.132]  I kind of want to reiterate what the guy called earlier from the Bronx.
[03:03:50.152 --> 03:03:51.433]  Was he a firefighter or a policeman?
[03:03:52.334 --> 03:03:53.295]  I believe it was a firefighter.
[03:03:53.939 --> 03:03:54.119]  Yeah.
[03:03:54.419 --> 03:04:03.101]  Well, I worked for the Napa Fire Department half for 25 years, more than one of the biggest in the country, and we've had very little training on this.
[03:04:03.121 --> 03:04:09.203]  The training that we have had on it is, basically, it was a 20-minute, you know, computer training.
[03:04:10.163 --> 03:04:19.445]  And you could tell that this training was sent right from the CDC, because it said things like, you know, wash your hands, it's not airborne, it can only live on surfaces for a few minutes.
[03:04:19.485 --> 03:04:21.606]  We've been given zero equipment to deal with this.
[03:04:22.987 --> 03:04:30.650]  The EMS department in Annapolis, they've actually given them some Tyvek suits and respirators, but they're giving the fire department nothing.
[03:04:31.511 --> 03:04:43.555]  And the thing about the firefighters, we will be... We're going to encounter this way before the doctors and the nurses do, because most firefighters in the United States that have paid professional firefighters are also EMP.
[03:04:44.235 --> 03:04:50.418]  So, 85% of what we do is EMS-related, and we will have... We will be the first ones rolling in on this.
[03:04:51.576 --> 03:04:54.617]  We were instructed in the training that it's not to be called Ebola.
[03:04:54.637 --> 03:04:56.757]  We're not to say Ebola on the air.
[03:04:56.898 --> 03:05:04.820]  I can't remember what they told us, but that it's going to be dispatched as like a code 75 or something, but it's not going to be, you know, we're not to say Ebola.
[03:05:05.160 --> 03:05:19.404]  So, but the problem is, you know, we could walk right, the way they dispatch things lots of times is not necessarily what you're going to because the people who are taking the phone calls don't pay attention or whatever, and we could walk right into the stuff and not even know it.
[03:05:20.319 --> 03:05:27.542]  Exactly, if they don't really know that this is a hazardous material, special caution at least, then people will just walk right into it.
[03:05:28.483 --> 03:05:44.290]  Well, you know, I was also on the hazmat team for five years, and one of the most important things when you deal with any type of hazardous materials incident, which I consider, if it's true or bold, to be hazardous materials, is the decontamination process, and when you take off your protective gear.
[03:05:44.830 --> 03:05:46.731]  You can't just put a suit on, walk in,
[03:05:47.392 --> 03:06:00.422]  Yeah, there's a huge event that goes on all around it or you'll just catch it when you take the suit off or give it to others.
[03:06:00.883 --> 03:06:01.463]  Absolutely.
[03:06:01.503 --> 03:06:05.366]  That's why this is so incredible is that just one patient can clog up a whole hospital.
[03:06:05.627 --> 03:06:06.267]  Thank you so much.
[03:06:06.287 --> 03:06:06.908]  We're out of time.
[03:06:07.348 --> 03:06:08.029]  Nightly News tonight at 7.
[03:06:10.180 --> 03:06:17.670]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO
