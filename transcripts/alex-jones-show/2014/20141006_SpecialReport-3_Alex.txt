[00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.372]  Well, it sounds like the perfect script for a horror movie.
[00:00:12.732 --> 00:00:17.396]  A virus with no vaccine and no cure kills thousands of people.
[00:00:17.757 --> 00:00:21.320]  And despite containment efforts, the virus is spreading.
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.404]  So many times, we will take something and then dial it back.
[00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:28.926]  Because we don't want to sound sensational.
[00:00:29.327 --> 00:00:31.529]  If it is sensational, it is sensational.
[00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:32.930]  And then you should report it.
[00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:36.333]  So many times in history, incredibly bad things happen.
[00:00:38.874 --> 00:00:46.299]  Because people can't believe something amazing is happening, either amazingly good or amazingly bad.
[00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:54.564]  So many people have something wonderful drop in their laps and they will self-destructively destroy themselves to sabotage it, not believing that they could be successful.
[00:00:55.205 --> 00:01:01.109]  Plans for mass graves confirmed, government surveying, cemetery readiness.
[00:01:02.438 --> 00:01:03.638]  For flu outbreak.
[00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:12.122]  His article needs to get people concerned so that we can have a debate about this and hopefully stop whatever's coming.
[00:01:12.582 --> 00:01:14.123]  Or at least be individually prepared for it.
[00:01:15.363 --> 00:01:23.727]  Because it's not my job to scare you, but when something is scary, it's not my job to say, is FEMA preparing for a pandemic?
[00:01:23.847 --> 00:01:24.527]  Question mark.
[00:01:25.847 --> 00:01:31.850]  Federal agency seeks 40 yard dumpsters for biomedical waste disposal during emergency.
[00:01:33.203 --> 00:01:43.108]  Well, I mean, they're preparing mass graves, they're preparing forced inoculations, they're preparing under InfraGard, lockdowns under clergy response teams, the church is saying, take your inoculations, go to the campus of the Lord.
[00:01:43.448 --> 00:01:44.468]  That's on the news!
[00:01:44.848 --> 00:01:54.073]  They're expanding across the board, and their main mission is letting the foreign globalist offshore crime syndicate take over this country.
[00:01:54.453 --> 00:02:00.616]  But here it is, plans for mass graves confirmed, government surveying, cemetery readiness for flu outbreak.
[00:02:01.832 --> 00:02:05.396]  And how to bury millions in Illinois, Indiana, New York.
[00:02:05.456 --> 00:02:07.017]  That's just three states we got documented.
[00:02:07.037 --> 00:02:16.487]  Our experts here at the CDC and across our government agree that the chances of an Ebola outbreak here in the United States are extremely low.
[00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:24.755]  There's a lot of evidence linking the development of Ebola and when it first began to show up on the scenes the last 40 years.
[00:02:26.056 --> 00:02:33.077]  Two western bioweapons laboratories that were on the Gold Coast, the western coast of Africa.
[00:02:33.798 --> 00:02:50.821]  And then, by 2002, tens of billions of dollars were spent for a program called BioShield, and under the cover of creating cures for biological weapons or treatments, they built bioweapons labs all over the United States, including in populated areas, despite protest.
[00:02:51.201 --> 00:03:02.164]  Like at the University of Texas in Galveston, right where hurricanes hit, and didn't even put the deadly pathogens in containment facilities underground, they did it in level 2 facilities.
[00:03:02.564 --> 00:03:07.005]  That's just like bringing Ebola infected patients to general hospitals.
[00:03:07.025 --> 00:03:15.747]  My concern is that do we have a bunch of little time bombs walking around the streets of America that are going to suddenly explode and we're going to suddenly start having cases?
[00:03:16.267 --> 00:03:24.275]  And it certainly doesn't help, like Dr. Davis suggested, bringing in infected people because none of us really trained for dealing with this level of infectious disease.
[00:03:24.355 --> 00:03:29.319]  It's not commonplace for us to down up and deal with patients of this caliber.
[00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.001]  New estimates by the U.S.
[00:03:31.021 --> 00:03:38.528]  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are warning that the number of Ebola cases could reach 1.4 million by mid-January.
[00:03:39.148 --> 00:03:39.429]  U.S.
[00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:44.195]  State Department orders 160,000 Ebola hazmat suits.
[00:03:44.675 --> 00:03:47.098]  Bulk purchases prompts concerns.
[00:03:48.681 --> 00:03:51.502]  About spread of deadly epidemic.
[00:03:51.822 --> 00:03:57.784]  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned hospitals and doctors that now is the time to prepare.
[00:03:58.464 --> 00:03:59.404]  Obama says U.S.
[00:03:59.444 --> 00:04:10.887]  military to provide equipment resources to battle Ebola epidemic in Africa and now it could gestate for a lot longer period making it more likely that it will end up getting into the United States.
[00:04:11.468 --> 00:04:15.549]  Our efforts to help mobilize the international community to fight it
[00:04:16.405 --> 00:04:20.930]  And the steps that we're taking to keep people here at home safe.
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.283]  ...has the capability of infecting 10 million people.
[00:04:34.084 --> 00:04:43.330]  Between the specialists they have on the ground in West Africa and here at headquarters, they've got hundreds of professionals who are working tirelessly on this issue.
[00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:53.036]  In a speech to the United Nations member states at the beginning of September, MSF's international president signaled the failure of the current strategy for combating Ebola.
[00:04:54.097 --> 00:05:05.064]  No organization, and that includes MSF, is equipped to deal with the explosion in the number of cases, the dozens of infected health workers, and collapse of the affected country's health systems.
[00:05:05.485 --> 00:05:07.526]  This is something that we take very seriously.
[00:05:08.426 --> 00:05:15.711]  As soon as there is an outbreak anywhere in the world of any disease, that could have significant effects.
[00:05:16.952 --> 00:05:23.016]  The CDC is in communication with the World Health Organization and other multilateral
[00:05:23.695 --> 00:05:24.195]  I think so.
[00:05:41.184 --> 00:05:47.449]  And that if it does, the CDC will invoke powers to hold a healthy person against their will.
[00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:59.539]  Dr. Gottlieb also points at an executive order passed by Obama on July 31st which allows for the detention of Americans who merely display signs of any respiratory illness.
[00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:03.501]  The CDC has confirmed the first case of Ebola in the United States.
[00:06:04.021 --> 00:06:06.462]  Obviously this is an unprecedented development.
[00:06:06.662 --> 00:06:16.846]  They admitted, they acknowledged, that family members of the victim there in the Dallas Hospital may also have been infected with the virus, as well as members of the community.
[00:06:17.266 --> 00:06:24.990]  And now we know that this victim, this Ebola victim, was active for several days with symptoms of the disease walking around the community.
[00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.211]  So the question remains, who else could have been infected?
[00:06:28.331 --> 00:06:34.035]  Now to go back over those four days and figure out anybody that person may have had contact with.
[00:06:34.195 --> 00:06:35.756]  That's absolutely critical.
[00:06:36.136 --> 00:06:41.800]  It is absolutely crucial to do that to try and prevent other people from possibly spreading this virus.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.682]  Now they're saying 80 people are being monitored.
[00:06:45.382 --> 00:06:48.865]  This one person can affect up to 80 people.
[00:06:49.065 --> 00:06:52.608]  Meanwhile, the CDC wants to tell you that there's nothing going on.
[00:06:53.068 --> 00:06:54.169]  That everything's fine.
[00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:55.330]  There's nothing to worry about.
[00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.132]  Continue going to school.
[00:06:57.352 --> 00:06:59.433]  Continue letting your child go out there.
[00:06:59.754 --> 00:07:00.995]  But the parents are saying no.
[00:07:01.035 --> 00:07:03.677]  The parents are pulling their kids out of the schools here.
[00:07:03.937 --> 00:07:07.700]  Because we know five children went to four of the local schools in the area.
[00:07:08.721 --> 00:07:11.123]  We will contact anyone who we think
[00:07:11.898 --> 00:07:17.384]  Has any likelihood of having had an exposure to the individual while they were infectious?
[00:07:18.205 --> 00:07:25.493]  At that point, at this point, that does not include anyone who might have traveled with him because he was not infectious at that time.
[00:07:25.614 --> 00:07:31.040]  Why haven't the flights from West Africa been stopped from coming into America like Europe and France have done?
[00:07:32.392 --> 00:07:35.293]  That's a question that's really not in my domain.
[00:07:35.453 --> 00:07:39.975]  We did not discuss that specific question.
[00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:43.336]  People talk about, well, we shouldn't allow any flights in from Liberia.
[00:07:44.277 --> 00:07:55.041]  I mean, we in America, how dare we turn our backs on Liberia, given the fact that this is a country that was founded in the 1820s, 1830s, because of American slavery.
[00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:59.163]  We could be looking at hundreds of thousands of people infected,
[00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:05.252]  With profound political and economic and security implications for all of us.
[00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:20.876]  Michael T. Osterholm, Director of the Centers for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, acknowledged in a recent New York Times op-ed that virologists are loathe to discuss openly, but are definitely considering in private, the possibility that Ebola has gone airborne.
[00:08:21.377 --> 00:08:25.498]  Top German virologist, Jonas Schmidt-Konsast,
[00:08:26.158 --> 00:08:32.743]  Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas.
[00:08:50.699 --> 00:08:57.233]  And let every other power know that this hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house.
