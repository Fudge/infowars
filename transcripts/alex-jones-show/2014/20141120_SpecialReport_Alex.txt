[00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:13.303]  The most recent rape allegations against Bill Cosby are being met with mixed reactions.
[00:00:13.743 --> 00:00:22.429]  After all, the 77-year-old was America's dad, Cliff Huxtable, who helped to break through racial barriers on primetime television.
[00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:33.317]  This meant for years, the media and most of the American public looked the other way, even after he dodged multiple accusations from women accusing him of drugging and raping them.
[00:00:33.657 --> 00:00:37.780]  Cosby even settled a civil suit with one accuser under undisclosed terms.
[00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:51.226]  But now with so many women coming forward and the power of the court of public opinion playing out online, people are finally beginning to grasp that perhaps a beloved TV father could be a serial rapist.
[00:00:51.707 --> 00:00:56.409]  So what does this say about the power of not only the media, but also our conditioning,
[00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:08.219]  When these victims dare speak out about this abuse, they are ostracized and driven into obscurity, while these men are protected and go on to have thriving careers.
[00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:17.587]  When womanizing former President Bill Clinton was accused of sexually assaulting multiple women, the media and feminists alike rallied around him.
[00:01:18.067 --> 00:01:25.453]  Clinton, who like Bill Cosby, has a long history of alleged sexual violence against women, dating back some 30 years.
[00:01:25.713 --> 00:01:37.241]  The media not only attempted to cover up the Lewinsky affair, his White House was pouring every ounce of energy into portraying this 21-year-old woman as a crazed liar and stalker.
[00:01:37.662 --> 00:01:40.784]  That is, until she produced Clinton's DNA evidence.
[00:01:41.164 --> 00:01:47.839]  The media, all too eager to play along, helped condition the public to believe their president was above the law.
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.567]  As a president, he could commit perjury and lie under oath.
[00:01:52.523 --> 00:02:08.855]  Director Woody Allen, who has for decades dodged allegations of sexually abusing his daughter, just wrapped his latest feature film, which will undoubtedly be heaped with praise, while the media firestorms surrounding his alleged molestation will have long fizzled out.
[00:02:09.336 --> 00:02:21.845]  And the latest manifestation of media conditioning happened just last night, when CNN's Don Lemon blamed a Cosby rape accuser for not using her teeth to bite her way out of sexual assault.
[00:02:22.205 --> 00:02:24.806]  Clearly, Lemon should have bit his tongue.
[00:02:25.347 --> 00:02:36.032]  Now, brushing off allegations of sexual assault and victim blaming not only allows the accused to move on to their next victim, but it also minimizes the act itself.
[00:02:36.712 --> 00:02:44.356]  This means that if a rapist were to receive any punishment at all, jail time might be less than those who are caught with marijuana,
[00:02:44.836 --> 00:03:05.568]  Or in the case of the Steubenville rape, the hackers who were responsible for leaking the rape video could be sentenced to up to 25 years in prison, while the two teenage boys who actually drugged and raped a teenage girl while videotaping and photographing the entire violent escapade will spend a mere 24 months in prison.
[00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:18.356]  And just to show how seriously those in power take rape accusations, two police officers here in Austin, Texas were caught on a dash cam saying, go ahead and call the cops.
[00:03:18.757 --> 00:03:20.278]  They can't un-rape you.
[00:03:20.798 --> 00:03:34.987]  And after responding to questions about the shocking string of rapes by officers, Highway Patrol Captain George Brown went on television telling women that if they don't want to be raped by police, they should obey traffic laws.
[00:03:35.427 --> 00:03:37.769]  Every two minutes, someone in the U.S.
[00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.772]  age 12 and older is sexually assaulted.
[00:03:41.233 --> 00:03:43.695]  It's an unacceptable act of violence.
[00:03:44.236 --> 00:03:56.508]  But while we're trying to teach young men that no means no, how can they expect to believe that when they see their older male counterparts getting away with sexual assault so long as they have enough money or influence?
[00:03:57.128 --> 00:04:08.915]  It's time for us to start standing behind these women who come forward, rather than protecting their rapists, and especially famous ones, under decades of lies, fraud, and deceit.
