[00:00:10.936 --> 00:00:18.260]  Hey guys, Rob Dew here from InfoWars.com, and as you know, if you've been watching any type of media out there, zombies have been everywhere.
[00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:21.682]  In the news, in comic books, in fiction, everywhere.
[00:00:22.023 --> 00:00:25.805]  Well, this weekend is the start of the newest season of The Walking Dead.
[00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:34.730]  Season 5 is going to premiere on Sunday, and our sources contacted us from over on the West Coast with some very interesting details.
[00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.673]  I'm not going to give you too much, but I will be giving you some spoilers here at the end.
[00:00:38.853 --> 00:00:40.454]  We didn't want to hurt you.
[00:00:43.527 --> 00:00:49.736]  But first I want to clear up a few things that have been going on with some different hoax articles that have been happening with zombies.
[00:00:50.597 --> 00:00:58.468]  Just two days ago from International Business Times, Ebola zombie apocalypse 2014 risen from the dead story is a hoax.
[00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.350]  And they are referencing an article that came out of a magazine called Huzzlers.
[00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.551]  H-U-Z-L-E-R-S.
[00:01:07.011 --> 00:01:08.111]  And they came out, here's the headline.
[00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:13.412]  Breaking news, Ebola victim rises from the dead in Africa, fear of a zombie apocalypse.
[00:01:13.432 --> 00:01:16.753]  They even show the picture of the guy that has supposedly risen from the dead.
[00:01:16.893 --> 00:01:20.834]  Yes, he does look exactly like what you would think a zombie would look like.
[00:01:21.434 --> 00:01:22.875]  Here's a quote from the article.
[00:01:22.975 --> 00:01:27.878]  Officials in Liberia have released the first confirmed image of a captured Ebola victim who rose from the dead.
[00:01:28.398 --> 00:01:36.963]  The name of the victim has not been released by the WHO and news of the patient rising from the dead comes only hours after the United States announced its first Ebola victim in Dallas.
[00:01:37.384 --> 00:01:44.428]  What these guys here are doing are kind of taking that news, creating fantasy and then try to ride off that wave of
[00:01:44.788 --> 00:01:56.032]  Zombie paranoia, Ebola victims coming into the United States, which we have been doing since, well, since the end of the summer we've been importing Ebola here into the United States, which is a serious issue.
[00:01:56.593 --> 00:01:58.954]  But, of course, people like this aren't going to talk about that.
[00:01:58.974 --> 00:02:03.015]  They're going to try to fancify it up and make a bunch of hubbub about nothing.
[00:02:03.295 --> 00:02:06.216]  Well, then you have our article that came out late last month.
[00:02:06.477 --> 00:02:07.077]  Here's the headline.
[00:02:07.757 --> 00:02:09.019]  And it's written by Don Salazar.
[00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.080]  Zombie apocalypse.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.763]  Ebola patients reportedly rise from the dead.
[00:02:13.204 --> 00:02:15.827]  Two patients come back to life right before their funerals.
[00:02:16.267 --> 00:02:19.511]  Well, if you read down, our source of the article is not Huzzlers.
[00:02:19.692 --> 00:02:20.312]  It's actually...
[00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:30.114]  A newspaper in Africa, the New Dawn, Truly Independent is what they call it, and from their article, their headline is, Dead Ebola Patients Resurrect.
[00:02:30.955 --> 00:02:36.978]  Two Ebola patients who died of the virus in separate communities in Nimba County have reportedly resurrected in the country.
[00:02:37.178 --> 00:02:45.382]  The victims, both females believed to be in their 60s and 40s respectively, died of the Ebola virus recently in Hope Village community and Catholic community in Gonta, Nimba.
[00:02:45.882 --> 00:02:51.546]  So this is actually a true source of news that we were getting our article from, that we wrote our article from.
[00:02:51.926 --> 00:03:00.833]  Not made up of whole cloth, which is essentially what the Huzzlers article was, taking that paranoia and putting a slight spin of truth and other stuff that were out there.
[00:03:01.733 --> 00:03:02.274]  I think?
[00:03:32.153 --> 00:03:33.814]  Here's another thing that is not a hoax.
[00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:40.896]  Out of CNN Politics, this was May 16, 2014, Pentagon lays out battle plan against zombies.
[00:03:41.716 --> 00:03:46.137]  In an unclassified document titled CONOP8888, officials from the U.S.
[00:03:46.157 --> 00:03:51.319]  Strategic Command use the specter of a planet-wide attack by the Walking Dead as training to complete for
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.844]  How to plan for real-life large-scale operations, emergencies, and catastrophes.
[00:03:56.944 --> 00:03:59.446]  And the Pentagon says there's a reasonable explanation.
[00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:04.650]  They're basically doing this to get everybody kind of juiced up and, oh yeah, we're going to go fight zombies.
[00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:08.854]  Which is really interesting because, well, about two years ago now,
[00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:22.103]  A company called the Halo Corp has trained, at the time, they've trained over 600,000 soldiers in a zombie-like scenario where they had soldiers actually shooting zombies during a medical pandemic.
[00:04:22.123 --> 00:04:23.503]  And we're going to roll some of that footage now.
[00:04:23.543 --> 00:04:25.124]  You can see the zombies walking in.
[00:04:25.904 --> 00:04:27.224]  Here's the troops shooting at them.
[00:04:34.405 --> 00:04:36.406]  Oh, and look, here's the tank rolling up.
[00:04:36.486 --> 00:04:38.466]  And look at the guys getting out in hazmat suits.
[00:04:39.864 --> 00:04:50.471]  Maybe something you could see in the future of people bleeding from their mouths and eyeballs and ears from their different orifices walking towards another group of people being defended by armed guards.
[00:04:51.171 --> 00:04:54.873]  The guards start mowing them down because they've been trained in this scenario to mow down people.
[00:04:55.494 --> 00:04:57.175]  And then you have guys in pandemic suits.
[00:04:57.195 --> 00:05:02.498]  So that's clearly a very, very plausible scenario that they developed.
[00:05:02.978 --> 00:05:07.401]  And what I really find interesting is a comment from the guy who was organizing all this.
[00:05:07.761 --> 00:05:08.662]  And here's what he had to say.
[00:05:10.163 --> 00:05:16.505]  Strategic Operations has trained some 600,000 military and law enforcement members using this technique.
[00:05:16.745 --> 00:05:19.746]  We've got it down to a science, if you will, if there is such a thing.
[00:05:19.826 --> 00:05:20.987]  It's an art, obviously.
[00:05:22.307 --> 00:05:29.070]  Now before we get to those spoilers for Season 5, I'm giving you plenty of chances to turn this off before we get to them, but before we get to those...
[00:05:30.168 --> 00:05:30.989]  You don't have to do this.
[00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:32.871]  We can put the world back to how it was.
[00:05:33.311 --> 00:05:41.899]  Remember in, it was back in 2013 in March, there was an episode in The Walking Dead where Rick is coming along and he meets the guy that actually helped him in the pilot.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:52.910]  And that guy has set up a security perimeter around the apartment complex he was living in and zombies were getting caught up in the barbed wire and then he was, you know, finishing them off by either shooting them or stabbing them with a spear.
[00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.132]  Well, here's an article out of the Daily Mail.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.901]  Is that fence to keep people out or patients in?
[00:05:59.041 --> 00:05:59.322]  U.S.
[00:05:59.402 --> 00:06:04.384]  troops set up at first Ebola-filled hospital in Liberia and start with a barbed wire perimeter.
[00:06:04.804 --> 00:06:16.050]  And there's photographs here, you can see them setting up the Constantino wire, just stretching out many layers of it, setting that up, putting it in, burying it with fence poles, stuff to really keep it secure, sort of like the same thing.
[00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.732]  Maybe they've watched that episode and decided this is what we have to do to keep us safe.
[00:06:19.792 --> 00:06:24.355]  If you remember, even a few weeks ago, there was a patient who got out of an Ebola.
[00:06:24.935 --> 00:06:25.055]  Go!
[00:06:25.075 --> 00:06:26.777]  You don't know what is at stake!
[00:06:47.810 --> 00:07:00.396]  So the end of Season 4 you saw some of the main characters get rounded up in this area called Terminus where they've been trying to get to all of that season and they all got split up and you had different adventures going on there and at the end we see them rounded up into a boxcar.
[00:07:00.917 --> 00:07:09.241]  Well now in Season 5 apparently people are going to be a bigger problem than the zombies and that is coming out of our sources that
[00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:30.081]  The zombies are going to still be there, but it's the people fighting each other, which we saw, which you've seen in other seasons with, you know, the governor and things like that, of the people not really coming together and working together as a team, actually seizing different resources and excluding some people and bringing in some people, and really, a really dog-eat-dog world, a Darwinian scenario.
[00:07:31.001 --> 00:07:34.682]  We're also going to have more major characters dying off, and really quickly.
[00:07:35.342 --> 00:07:43.285]  Don't be surprised if you see several of your favorites, maybe even Norman Reedus, the archer, maybe seeing him die off.
[00:07:43.825 --> 00:07:44.305]  Who knows?
[00:07:44.465 --> 00:07:51.227]  I'm not going to spoil that one for you, but I was told at least two people who I know for a fact are going to die, and they are going to be main characters.
[00:07:52.108 --> 00:07:53.548]  There is going to be more romance.
[00:07:53.628 --> 00:07:55.329]  It's not just going to be Glenn and Maggie.
[00:07:55.349 --> 00:07:57.709]  You're also going to have some other romances develop.
[00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.930]  They didn't say who.
[00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:01.651]  My guess is it's going to be Beth and Daryl.
[00:08:02.091 --> 00:08:08.675]  Also, we're now at least a year and a half, maybe two years into the zombie apocalypse, and the zombies are really starting to fall apart.
[00:08:08.695 --> 00:08:15.119]  So you're going to see some more grotesque zombies than you would have seen in the previous seasons, where before they still looked like they could have been humans.
[00:08:15.559 --> 00:08:23.284]  Maybe they could be turned back into humans with special drugs or whatever, but now it's full-blown rotting corpses coming at you.
[00:08:23.664 --> 00:08:23.924]  We're good.
[00:08:39.033 --> 00:08:42.116]  Wow, this is a pretty entertaining series and it's a lot of fun out there.
[00:08:42.136 --> 00:08:49.183]  There is some real scary stuff going on, especially with our country and the precautions that they're not taking that they should be taking with Ebola.
[00:08:49.503 --> 00:08:50.164]  So remember that.
[00:08:50.184 --> 00:08:51.745]  I'm going to put some links down there at the bottom.
[00:08:52.045 --> 00:08:54.468]  Let me know what you think is going to be happening in the Walking Dead season.
[00:08:54.508 --> 00:08:57.731]  And for all you InfoWars fans who are wondering why I'm talking about the Walking Dead,
[00:08:58.231 --> 00:08:59.732]  It's called hijacking media.
[00:09:00.112 --> 00:09:06.114]  We bring up media stuff to get other people in there and then put our spin on it and let them know what's really going on out there.
[00:09:06.134 --> 00:09:07.614]  So I hope you appreciated this.
[00:09:07.674 --> 00:09:08.775]  Please spread it out to your friends.
[00:09:08.895 --> 00:09:10.475]  Like and subscribe below if you haven't done that.
[00:09:10.956 --> 00:09:13.296]  I'm Rob Doo with Infowars.com and we'll see you next time.
[00:09:21.448 --> 00:09:24.229]  TSA stick hand in my pants for safety.
[00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.531]  Drones overhead good.
[00:09:27.831 --> 00:09:29.752]  GMO food make you strong.
[00:09:30.573 --> 00:09:35.535]  Vaccine in arm good.
[00:09:35.715 --> 00:09:38.056]  Mainstream media tell you truth.
[00:09:51.209 --> 00:09:52.630]  My friends, we have done it.
[00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:59.353]  With Dr. Group's help, we have developed the ultimate male vitality supplement with eight concentrated super herbs.
[00:09:59.993 --> 00:10:05.495]  This is the answer to the globalist war on male vitality with the estrogen mimickers they've added to the food and the water supply.
[00:10:05.795 --> 00:10:12.038]  And now our test pilot, our Chuck Yeager, Dr. Edward Group, is here to test his greatest invention.
[00:10:12.238 --> 00:10:12.598]  Doctor?
[00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:14.179]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:10:14.559 --> 00:10:18.961]  I will now take two droppers to test this ultimate male vitality formula.
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.186]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a momentous moment.
[00:10:25.206 --> 00:10:27.029]  Thank you, Dr. Groot.
[00:10:27.911 --> 00:10:30.195]  I will activate my muscles by doing push-ups.
[00:10:30.899 --> 00:10:32.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is it.
[00:10:32.741 --> 00:10:33.501]  This is the move.
[00:10:33.541 --> 00:10:35.103]  This is unprecedented.
[00:10:35.123 --> 00:10:37.805]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to see what happens right now.
[00:10:37.825 --> 00:10:38.746]  Oh my God!
[00:10:38.886 --> 00:10:39.567]  What the hell!
[00:10:39.747 --> 00:10:40.528]  Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[00:10:40.728 --> 00:10:41.409]  Get out of here!
[00:10:41.429 --> 00:10:41.929]  Shut this down!
[00:10:41.949 --> 00:10:43.250]  This is not safe!
[00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:43.811]  Hold on!
[00:10:44.011 --> 00:10:45.112]  Settle down!
[00:10:45.272 --> 00:10:46.033]  Get another doctor!
[00:10:46.073 --> 00:10:46.633]  Something's wrong!
[00:10:46.894 --> 00:10:47.554]  Something's wrong with him!
[00:10:47.574 --> 00:10:48.095]  Help him!
[00:10:48.115 --> 00:10:50.137]  Ladies and gentlemen, we did not intend for that to happen.
[00:10:50.237 --> 00:10:51.097]  I take it personally.
[00:10:51.318 --> 00:10:52.459]  Do not have those problems.
[00:10:53.099 --> 00:10:56.882]  Again, these are authorized herbs, well known to be safe.
[00:10:58.243 --> 00:10:59.284]  Please, doctor!
[00:10:59.684 --> 00:11:00.524]  Doctor, wait a minute!
[00:11:00.725 --> 00:11:03.406]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're just going to cut the commercial for just a moment.
[00:11:03.606 --> 00:11:04.127]  Cut, cut, cut!
[00:11:04.167 --> 00:11:08.930]  Get everybody out of here!
[00:11:09.651 --> 00:11:10.871]  Super Male Vitality.
[00:11:11.452 --> 00:11:12.052]  It's awesome.
[00:11:12.513 --> 00:11:14.314]  Just not this awesome.
[00:11:16.724 --> 00:11:19.446]  Ladies and gentlemen, the dramatization you've just seen is just that.
[00:11:20.026 --> 00:11:26.029]  It is satire to illustrate in a satirical way the incredible power of super male vitality.
[00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:35.194]  It will not turn you into Conan the Barbarian, but it will help block some of the estrogen mimickers and reportedly let your glands produce the natural hormones your body needs.
[00:11:35.694 --> 00:11:39.676]  It also does have some other side effects in the human testing that we discovered, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:39.696 --> 00:11:43.098]  I'm about to illustrate right now what that is.
[00:11:43.718 --> 00:11:44.578]  Let's see if I can do it again.
[00:11:44.598 --> 00:11:45.519]  It takes some focus.
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.082]  Up, up and away!
[00:11:55.271 --> 00:11:59.717]  Start your journey to super male vitality today at InfoWarsLife.com
