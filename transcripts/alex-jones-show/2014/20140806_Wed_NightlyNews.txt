[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:04.954]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[00:00:05.094 --> 00:00:07.216]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds.
[00:00:07.336 --> 00:00:12.902]  One thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans, everybody in between, is that we all hated the bank bailout.
[00:00:13.082 --> 00:00:16.285]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.427]  Time to choose sides is now.
[00:00:23.717 --> 00:00:27.101]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is an emergency transmission.
[00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:35.169]  The United States government has been taken over by a shadow government, a criminal element that spies on the American people.
[00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:42.377]  It launches false flag terror attacks on its own citizens and it starts illegal and unjust wars for
[00:00:42.777 --> 00:00:54.343]  Well, for resources and imperial control, and they're hell-bent on destroying what's left of our constitutional republic in order to establish a one-world government in its ruins.
[00:00:54.763 --> 00:01:08.810]  Those of you watching our broadcast for the first time tonight, well, I'm sure you've figured out by now that you're not watching the mainstream news media, because the truth will not be televised, at least not by any of the mainstream television news networks,
[00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.550]  Thank you.
[00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:36.581]  Tonight, a massive buildup of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border in the last 48 hours.
[00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:39.843]  And is the government hiding suspected Ebola cases from the public?
[00:01:39.943 --> 00:01:44.765]  There have been about a half a dozen patients who have had their blood tested because of concern.
[00:01:44.785 --> 00:01:47.866]  Those particular patients, their stories were not made public.
[00:01:48.146 --> 00:01:50.547]  Then Jesse Ventura sets the record straight.
[00:01:51.307 --> 00:01:54.509]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:02:00.131 --> 00:02:14.275]  Well, it looks like Russia is finally preparing for a large-scale invasion of the Ukraine, as there has recently been a massive build-up on the Ukrainian border, where Russia has more than doubled their troop levels.
[00:02:14.555 --> 00:02:17.335]  So, it definitely looks like they are getting ready to rumble.
[00:02:17.435 --> 00:02:27.438]  Yesterday, Vladimir Putin called for an emergency meeting on the United Nations Security Council to resolve the humanitarian crisis in the Ukraine.
[00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:31.522]  Yeah, notice how it's always a humanitarian crisis.
[00:02:32.103 --> 00:02:44.677]  But the untold story behind the crisis is that this is an energy tug-of-war that's being fought between Russia and Western powers and the Ukraine is simply caught up in the middle.
[00:02:45.057 --> 00:02:52.481]  Not to mention the fact that Ukraine is a very important and strategic placemat on the Grand Chess Board.
[00:02:52.842 --> 00:03:00.126]  Now, there is reportedly tens of thousands of people displaced because of the fighting over the last several months.
[00:03:00.706 --> 00:03:16.186]  The Russian Foreign Ministry said the UN and the Red Cross have a readiness plan to deploy a humanitarian mission to the Ukraine, which some consider to be a pretext for an invasion by Russian forces.
[00:03:16.807 --> 00:03:17.348]  Yeah, you think?
[00:03:17.968 --> 00:03:20.590]  I mean, the Russians are battle ready.
[00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:28.097]  They have a large force of infantry, armor, artillery and air defense right there on the Ukrainian border.
[00:03:28.377 --> 00:03:31.119]  And we're talking about 17 battalions.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.301]  That's about 20,000 troops.
[00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:39.026]  And to be honest, I don't think the Obama administration is prepared to do anything about it.
[00:03:39.366 --> 00:03:52.015]  After heavy sanctions against Russian politicians and businessmen, and a direct attack on Russia's economy, Vladimir Putin is about to show the world what a Russian response looks like.
[00:03:52.916 --> 00:03:55.158]  So brace yourselves, the Russians are coming.
[00:03:55.458 --> 00:03:59.541]  And this could very well be the build-up to the next great war.
[00:03:59.941 --> 00:04:07.026]  Now, I want to switch gears real quick and talk about the recent Ebola outbreak, because the CDC
[00:04:08.107 --> 00:04:13.628]  Still remain silent on the number of potential Ebola victims inside the United States.
[00:04:14.228 --> 00:04:15.388]  That's a scary thought.
[00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:20.349]  Now I understand that the CDC might not want to start a panic, or would they?
[00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:23.750]  But there is a growing concern that U.S.
[00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.531]  hospitals are not prepared to deal with a wider outbreak of the virus.
[00:04:28.791 --> 00:04:33.392]  You may recall yesterday we reported that CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta
[00:04:33.972 --> 00:04:46.657]  ...said that health authorities had tested at least six potential Ebola victims, but their stories were not made public, suggesting that the CDC was keeping a lid on that information.
[00:04:47.137 --> 00:05:01.063]  And don't forget that we reported last week that President Barack Obama signed an executive order which allows health care authorities to detain Americans who merely show signs of a respiratory illness.
[00:05:01.463 --> 00:05:15.173]  Meanwhile, the CDC has also outlined measures for dealing with an outbreak which will allow for the quarantine of well persons, so healthy individuals who do not show symptoms of the disease.
[00:05:15.893 --> 00:05:16.133]  Wow.
[00:05:16.934 --> 00:05:20.116]  That, my friends, that sounds like forced vaccinations.
[00:05:20.517 --> 00:05:22.778]  That sounds like internment camps.
[00:05:23.278 --> 00:05:30.824]  And for more on this, we take you now to Leanne McAdoo, who is standing by with a retired sergeant and a bioweapons expert.
[00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:32.998]  Thank you, Darren.
[00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:35.940]  Well, today I'm going to be speaking with Christopher Palo.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.821]  He is a retired sergeant.
[00:05:38.161 --> 00:05:45.924]  He spent more than 10 years working as a chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear specialist in the U.S.
[00:05:46.024 --> 00:05:50.667]  Army, where he worked extensively researching the Ebola virus.
[00:05:51.067 --> 00:05:59.671]  Now, Christopher is going to be speaking with me today specifically about the risks associated with transporting this deadly strain of Ebola into the country.
[00:06:00.091 --> 00:06:01.552]  Christopher, well, welcome to the show.
[00:06:01.892 --> 00:06:13.041]  Now, the CDC specifically cautioned people against flying to these affected regions, but you believe that it's perfectly safe that the State Department has now brought in these infected Americans to the country.
[00:06:13.301 --> 00:06:13.582]  Why?
[00:06:14.743 --> 00:06:18.686]  Because of the level of safety that the CDC actually has.
[00:06:19.426 --> 00:06:24.890]  In each one of the, in the CDC, there are certain levels of labs.
[00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.912]  They're called BSLs or biosafety labs.
[00:06:27.352 --> 00:06:28.493]  They range from one through four.
[00:06:29.594 --> 00:06:36.478]  Um, at level four, being the highest, um, basically that's where Ebola and an Ebola patient would go.
[00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:48.485]  You know, in each hospital that a, uh, Ebola patient would go to, especially if it's run by the CDC, has these, these, uh, I guess parameters you could say set up to where it's safe.
[00:06:48.886 --> 00:06:50.767]  They're in a completely, uh, sealed room.
[00:06:51.267 --> 00:06:53.990]  Where it's actually, it's under pressured.
[00:06:54.450 --> 00:07:00.556]  So say for some reason there's a crack in the glass or a hole in the wall, air will actually flow into the room not letting anything out.
[00:07:00.836 --> 00:07:04.960]  And since Ebola is not an airborne agent or a pathogen rather,
[00:07:06.661 --> 00:07:08.604]  There's not a lot of issue with that.
[00:07:08.964 --> 00:07:12.168]  I mean, with Ebola, you treat it like you would a cold or anything like that.
[00:07:12.709 --> 00:07:15.052]  You just stay away from bodily fluids or anything like that.
[00:07:16.033 --> 00:07:25.124]  Any test done on an individual who has Ebola, they either do it in the room there or they triple
[00:07:26.065 --> 00:07:37.093]  Basically, they triple contain the sample in a metal container, and then an airtight plastic bag, and then essentially what's a safe to transport it to another location.
[00:07:37.233 --> 00:07:51.783]  And in this location, there's a lab where it's, again, it's under-pressured, and the people who are working in the lab are in over-pressured suits, meaning that there's more pressure on the inside of the suit than the outside air, so air would flow out, again, not letting the contagion in.
[00:07:52.643 --> 00:07:52.803]  I don't
[00:08:13.815 --> 00:08:14.155]  I'm sorry.
[00:08:35.947 --> 00:08:42.933]  Well, the AP reported that one of these patients was actually walked out of the ambulance and walked right into the hospital.
[00:08:42.953 --> 00:08:46.016]  He wasn't inside one of these special containment tents.
[00:08:46.216 --> 00:08:48.258]  That's not really level four isolation.
[00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:49.018]  Right.
[00:08:49.038 --> 00:08:55.604]  I believe I saw that video of him being actually walked from the ambulance into the hospital.
[00:08:55.644 --> 00:08:58.666]  If you look, he is in a suit, right?
[00:08:58.686 --> 00:09:00.028]  And like I said, it's not airborne.
[00:09:00.828 --> 00:09:01.509]  It comes from
[00:09:03.824 --> 00:09:08.906]  It's like I said, it's bodily fluids, you know, spit, feces, blood, what have you.
[00:09:10.167 --> 00:09:24.053]  And also there is a 2 to 21 day incubation period where it sits there, you don't show any symptoms, you know, so the guy's not going to be hacking up blood and making the actual agent, I'm sorry, not agent, the pathogen aerosolized.
[00:09:24.793 --> 00:09:37.177]  So basically covering him up in a suit where he can't, none of his bodily fluids can get out and transporting him from point A, from the ambulance to the hospital as long as there's, you know, it's perfectly safe as long as there's nobody around him.
[00:09:37.197 --> 00:09:45.200]  What they're going to do with that suit afterwards is they're going to burn it, you know, and they're going to put him in an isolated area and quarantine him for research and treatment.
[00:09:46.041 --> 00:09:56.496]  Now, one strain of Ebola, the Ebola Reston, was actually found to be transmitted between monkeys via air, and that was in Reston, Virginia.
[00:09:56.936 --> 00:09:58.619]  Yes, yes.
[00:09:58.659 --> 00:10:00.782]  What it was, was it was because it's considered a
[00:10:03.465 --> 00:10:03.525]  I'm
[00:10:20.576 --> 00:10:21.616]  Um, from you coughing.
[00:10:22.016 --> 00:10:28.278]  And so that way it can be transmitted through the air, but it's not really like an airborne airborne threat.
[00:10:28.698 --> 00:10:29.779]  It's within a certain parameter.
[00:10:29.799 --> 00:10:33.580]  And that's why in Reston, it is actually, they're quarantined off.
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:42.282]  And then after that happened, they tested everybody and they cleared down the room and actually shut, um, what's called, um, flooded the room with UV with UV rays after that.
[00:10:43.317 --> 00:10:46.979]  So one of the things we really would need to worry about is if there are any human error.
[00:10:47.299 --> 00:11:02.128]  Obviously we've reported before how the CDC and a lot of these other maximum lab facilities, maximum security facilities have mistakenly put smallpox vials like on a shelf back in a storage room and just forgot about it and things like that.
[00:11:02.209 --> 00:11:07.352]  So there's always the potential for something like this to cause an outbreak.
[00:11:08.152 --> 00:11:09.093]  But you don't really think that that's
[00:11:09.921 --> 00:11:12.744]  Yeah, I mean there is potential.
[00:11:12.764 --> 00:11:14.686]  There's human error, you know.
[00:11:14.846 --> 00:11:29.060]  The one thing about Ebola as opposed to other contagions is there are actually people who have PhDs in virology that will not work with Ebola because it is so deadly and it is so dangerous.
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.003]  So I feel that the level of fear here actually
[00:11:32.503 --> 00:11:40.250]  Would help to minimize, not eliminate, you know, because you can almost never eliminate human error, but minimize human error in that.
[00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:41.912]  Now, is there a chance it can get out?
[00:11:42.853 --> 00:11:44.414]  Yes, it can.
[00:11:44.615 --> 00:11:46.176]  You know, I mean, there's a chance for anything, really.
[00:11:47.237 --> 00:11:57.547]  But it's minimal, and I personally, I am not afraid of it, or even to go into the facility where the Ebola patient is being housed, if you will.
[00:11:58.837 --> 00:12:07.725]  Now when we were speaking yesterday, you were saying that the potentiality of Ebola being used as a bioweapon was, you know, just really didn't even make sense.
[00:12:08.226 --> 00:12:12.950]  But the Navy Times published an article just recently speaking about how U.S.
[00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:16.394]  biowarfare scientists have been interested in Ebola since the 1970s.
[00:12:19.375 --> 00:12:29.397]  Mainly because Ebola and its fellow viruses have high mortality rates and its stable nature in aerosol make it attractive as a potential biological weapon.
[00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:31.136]  Right.
[00:12:32.336 --> 00:12:51.681]  Well, the thing about bioweapons is we as a country have basically signed agreements, and I believe it's part of the Geneva Convention, that says that the only reason we cannot create bioweapons, we cannot create chemical weapons, we can on the other hand keep a stockpile of
[00:12:52.461 --> 00:13:04.528]  Certain materials like, you know, Ebola or, you know, Spanish flu or whatever around to do tests on them to figure out how to create deterrent from other countries using bioweapons.
[00:13:05.068 --> 00:13:14.853]  Now, the idea of an actual Ebola, the only way to actually create an Ebola bioweapon is to actually take the Ebola virus and mutate it into something you can control.
[00:13:14.933 --> 00:13:17.955]  But right now we don't know hardly anything about Ebola.
[00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:22.977]  In order to actually create treatments for it, let alone turn it into a bioweapon.
[00:13:23.317 --> 00:13:30.400]  The idea of using Ebola as a bioweapon is, in my mind, just, it's a terrible idea because you can't control it.
[00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:35.282]  You know, you drop, you say, you turn Ebola into a bioweapon in a bomb form.
[00:13:35.502 --> 00:13:36.462]  You drop it on a country.
[00:13:36.782 --> 00:13:41.965]  Next thing you know, the entire country is infected with Ebola because it spreads ridiculously fast.
[00:13:42.065 --> 00:13:44.786]  It has a burner, it basically, from
[00:13:45.686 --> 00:13:55.393]  As an incubation period of 2 to 21 days, meaning you don't show any symptoms from 2 to 21 days, so you're running around, flying around, interacting with people, you know, shaking hands, spreading bodily fluids, all that jazz.
[00:13:56.193 --> 00:14:02.878]  In that case, it could probably, in my opinion anyway, it could probably take out the entire world's population in a few months.
[00:14:03.358 --> 00:14:05.840]  So in that way, it's a terrible idea.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.001]  It's not a good idea at all.
[00:14:07.241 --> 00:14:08.362]  I don't think
[00:14:08.962 --> 00:14:09.122]  What's
[00:14:29.292 --> 00:14:29.533]  I'm good.
[00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:45.543]  And that way it would be, that way it would be feasible, but not Ebola.
[00:14:45.883 --> 00:14:54.687]  You know, to actually make a virus into a bioweapon, especially when we can't cure viruses, we can treat them and we can vaccinate against some of them, but we can't cure them.
[00:14:54.747 --> 00:14:59.129]  It's just, it's, in my, in my head, it's just, it's not, it's not feasible, really.
[00:14:59.429 --> 00:15:01.630]  So what about the fact that we have U.S.
[00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.611]  biowarfare researchers in the Ebola zone?
[00:15:04.951 --> 00:15:14.534]  Fort Detrick, people there, they just released a paper to the CDC about a month ago admitting that the particular strain that they're working with, that the U.S.
[00:15:14.574 --> 00:15:20.695]  government has a patent on, may have been responsible for the particular outbreak that's going on in Sierra Leone.
[00:15:21.836 --> 00:15:22.496]  That's frightening.
[00:15:23.132 --> 00:15:23.833]  That is, that is.
[00:15:24.673 --> 00:15:29.376]  I personally don't know really much about that, that particular statement.
[00:15:31.137 --> 00:15:39.702]  But you can, think of it this way, the, you know, with bioweapons researchers, they're, you know, especially working for the U.S.
[00:15:39.742 --> 00:15:41.584]  military in that aspect, they're going to be the top in the field.
[00:15:43.084 --> 00:15:51.570]  And they're going to know the most about a certain subject, you know, in this case Ebola, BDV, I'm sorry, BDBV, you know.
[00:15:52.310 --> 00:16:03.459]  So, they're the ones who are going to be out there knowing, okay, so this strain does this, this, this, and this, you know, and by using these synthesized proteins or whatever, we may be able to put a stop on it.
[00:16:03.559 --> 00:16:14.147]  And by them actually, you know, to comment on the quote itself, if they're the cause of it, I don't know.
[00:16:14.267 --> 00:16:16.069]  I honestly couldn't tell you.
[00:16:16.489 --> 00:16:18.010]  I know that that would actually be in
[00:16:19.151 --> 00:16:19.772]  We're good.
[00:16:30.834 --> 00:16:36.219]  You know, early 2000s was because they were using chemical weapons on, you know, in northern Iraq.
[00:16:36.279 --> 00:16:37.360]  We went there to stop that.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:45.326]  And, I mean, if we're doing that to, you know, Central Africa censors Southern Africa, then that pretty much just makes us hypocrites.
[00:16:45.386 --> 00:16:47.969]  But I don't know anything about that personally.
[00:16:47.989 --> 00:16:50.711]  I haven't seen that article or read about it.
[00:16:51.692 --> 00:16:55.395]  So I really can't make an informed comment on that, if that makes sense.
[00:16:55.675 --> 00:16:56.416]  Right, absolutely.
[00:16:56.456 --> 00:17:03.321]  Well, it just kind of proves that we need to have a deeper investigation into what exactly they're studying there at that lab.
[00:17:03.341 --> 00:17:15.389]  I'm sure they'll claim all sorts of national security issues with finding out what they're doing in there, but that's a huge cause for concern if they're actually admitting that that could potentially have caused that current outbreak.
[00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:20.414]  Are we seeing here with this, you know, the media here is really hyping it up.
[00:17:20.454 --> 00:17:26.980]  We've got CNN standing outside the hospitals reporting on all of these people that are showing symptoms of Ebola.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:33.466]  Meanwhile, you know, like we discussed yesterday, you said having the flu or, you know, mono could give you Ebola-like symptoms.
[00:17:34.747 --> 00:17:41.173]  I feel like this is kind of what we saw leading up to the swine flu when they really rolled it out and rushed out the vaccines.
[00:17:42.287 --> 00:17:44.489]  Yeah, it's... I mean, there are a lot of things.
[00:17:44.529 --> 00:17:46.911]  I mean, it's a worst-case scenario, you know?
[00:17:47.011 --> 00:17:55.079]  So, once... It's like, okay, say you're in college and you're taking a... You haven't taken a psychology class, but you're gonna just take an abnormal psychology class.
[00:17:55.659 --> 00:18:00.043]  All of a sudden, you have everything in that class because you start fitting certain criteria, you know?
[00:18:01.184 --> 00:18:05.265]  What the doctors will do when a person's like, I think I got Ebola, right?
[00:18:05.285 --> 00:18:06.545]  They're going to quarantine them.
[00:18:06.565 --> 00:18:07.606]  They're going to do it.
[00:18:07.626 --> 00:18:08.686]  I mean, because it's protocol.
[00:18:09.026 --> 00:18:19.008]  And then they're going to test for certain things like malaria, typhoid fever, shinglosis, cholera, and a whole slew of other things, you know, because it's...
[00:18:21.349 --> 00:18:36.013]  They have to rule out these other ones first because, I mean, basically Ebola is a death sentence, you know, and they can actually do, they can actually combat, if you will, maybe not cure, but combat some of these other viruses and other diseases.
[00:18:36.973 --> 00:18:40.174]  But again, it's just really, these people are
[00:18:40.754 --> 00:18:42.095]  You know, oh, I'm sick.
[00:18:42.175 --> 00:18:44.237]  I have it because I have so many symptoms.
[00:18:44.257 --> 00:18:44.738]  I have a headache.
[00:18:44.798 --> 00:18:45.718]  I have a backache, you know.
[00:18:45.859 --> 00:18:49.221]  Oh, you know, I mean that could be any number of things, you know.
[00:18:49.622 --> 00:18:55.207]  It starts out like a lot of other viruses or diseases and then, you know, goes from there.
[00:18:55.247 --> 00:18:58.289]  I mean, you'll know you have Ebola after about two weeks when you start bleeding out.
[00:18:58.530 --> 00:18:58.790]  Just saying.
[00:18:59.249 --> 00:18:59.489]  Right.
[00:19:00.089 --> 00:19:07.833]  Well, it seems like there are certain, you know, people that are going to profit off of having this potential scare.
[00:19:07.973 --> 00:19:14.856]  Obviously, you know, we heard about Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney, you know, really profiting off Tamiflu with the whole swine flu thing.
[00:19:14.896 --> 00:19:19.118]  Of course, a lot of people died as a result of the rushing out of that vaccine.
[00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:20.279]  We don't really hear about that.
[00:19:20.319 --> 00:19:22.220]  They pulled, you know, Tamiflu off the shelves.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:23.541]  And everything like that.
[00:19:23.621 --> 00:19:27.084]  And now they're saying they want to rush out this new Ebola vaccine.
[00:19:27.604 --> 00:19:32.528]  Meanwhile, Ebola isn't even, it's not even a huge pandemic at the moment.
[00:19:32.548 --> 00:19:37.052]  We've got two cases of people we've actually brought in to the country.
[00:19:37.152 --> 00:19:38.453]  Nothing that's actually been here.
[00:19:39.139 --> 00:19:39.579]  Exactly.
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:47.526]  I mean, yeah, we've had Ebola as the virus itself in the United States at least since the 80s.
[00:19:47.946 --> 00:19:52.630]  It's been, like I said, been in four labs, at least four labs in DC and in Atlanta.
[00:19:53.371 --> 00:19:57.294]  But you said something earlier that, or yesterday, that actually really connects to this.
[00:19:57.434 --> 00:19:59.656]  It's the best way to control people is through fear.
[00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:03.479]  You know, so you want to sell a product, make these people think they need it.
[00:20:03.999 --> 00:20:04.079]  Yeah.
[00:20:14.844 --> 00:20:16.465]  But, you know, that's what I see.
[00:20:16.525 --> 00:20:22.007]  I see causing a panic, and then causing a need for something, and then creating profits out of it.
[00:20:22.027 --> 00:20:22.687]  Does that make sense?
[00:20:23.067 --> 00:20:23.987]  Yeah.
[00:20:24.027 --> 00:20:25.448]  Yeah, I mean, to me, that's what it is.
[00:20:25.548 --> 00:20:26.648]  It's just, they're creating this panic.
[00:20:26.668 --> 00:20:29.969]  You bring a guy over, all of a sudden, oh, opportunity for money, you know?
[00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:40.393]  In my opinion, and, you know, this is just me, in my opinion, there is no reason to be afraid, because the CDC has things under control, you know?
[00:20:40.733 --> 00:20:42.474]  Yes, there is a potential for human error,
[00:20:43.462 --> 00:21:12.381]  But I believe given the circumstances of this virus and the fact that there's really only two people that we know of for a fact that have it in the United States, and they're both under quarantine by the CDC who works directly with the World Health Organization, who are the two greatest, you know, companies or organizations rather on the planet for, you know, biological, you know, and biologically contagion, you know, elements of science, if you will.
[00:21:14.664 --> 00:21:17.689]  To bring these people into the country.
[00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:38.702]  Well, so do you have any advice for people, anything that they can particularly do if they are just very fearful, you know, short of going, rushing out, getting this experimental vaccine that they're talking about pushing out in September?
[00:21:39.242 --> 00:21:43.266]  What are some other things people can be aware of, take precautions, things like that?
[00:21:44.218 --> 00:21:45.239]  Inform yourself, really.
[00:21:45.979 --> 00:21:48.100]  The best thing you can do is become knowledgeable.
[00:21:48.781 --> 00:21:53.583]  Go to the CDC websites, go to the World Health Organization websites, pick up a book.
[00:21:53.743 --> 00:21:55.224]  Actually learn about this thing.
[00:21:55.304 --> 00:22:01.628]  Learn about what it does, how it does, and then once you see that, actually figure out, okay, now how are they controlling it?
[00:22:02.008 --> 00:22:07.111]  Again, the CDC websites have all this information, the World Health Organization have all this information, and they're actually hotlines.
[00:22:07.791 --> 00:22:07.911]  Yeah.
[00:22:26.681 --> 00:22:31.143]  You know, obviously make him wear a mask and then get him to the doctor to get him checked out.
[00:22:31.443 --> 00:22:32.824]  That's the best you can do.
[00:22:33.284 --> 00:22:34.944]  There is no magical cure.
[00:22:34.984 --> 00:22:39.626]  Like I read someplace that it said, if I eat three onions a day, I won't get, you know, Ebola.
[00:22:39.967 --> 00:22:41.187]  No, that's a terrible idea.
[00:22:41.227 --> 00:22:48.190]  It might help your ulcers, but no, you know, um, there is no magical pill or magical cure or magical anything for this.
[00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.051]  You just have to be informed and
[00:22:50.931 --> 00:23:04.145]  Cautious, you know, not don't be afraid of it, you know, because you're afraid of it then it's gonna cause you to do Erratic things and things that you wouldn't normally do which may actually end up in a self-fulfilling prophecy, but just be knowledgeable about it, really All right.
[00:23:04.165 --> 00:23:12.214]  Well, thank you so much for joining us I mean, I'm still a little you know, even though I want to put all my trust into the CDC and the World Health Organization we know
[00:23:13.288 --> 00:23:19.210]  They get kind of their bread and butter from vaccines and big pharma, so it's a little, you know, caught in those things.
[00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:27.093]  But I am kind of really wanting people to be cautious about getting caught up in all the fear surrounding this because it's definitely a form of control.
[00:23:27.873 --> 00:23:28.334]  I agree.
[00:23:28.414 --> 00:23:33.476]  And like I said, the best thing you could do is just to form yourself, you know, learn about it, study it, know it.
[00:23:33.896 --> 00:23:34.116]  So.
[00:23:35.036 --> 00:23:35.256]  All right.
[00:23:35.296 --> 00:23:36.477]  Well, thank you so much for your time.
[00:23:37.097 --> 00:23:37.337]  Thank you.
[00:23:38.527 --> 00:23:43.229]  Well, Christopher Palo has more than 10 years of extensive research into this disease.
[00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:46.490]  He doesn't believe that Ebola is something we need to be really concerned with.
[00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:55.814]  At the moment, presently as today, there are just a little over 900 cases of people who have actually died from this current outbreak of Ebola.
[00:23:56.634 --> 00:23:58.715]  No cases so far here in the U.S.
[00:23:58.915 --> 00:24:05.757]  save for those two Americans who have been brought in by the State Department, who says it's perfectly fine, perfectly safe that they are being brought in.
[00:24:06.238 --> 00:24:06.938]  So the question is,
[00:24:07.478 --> 00:24:13.143]  Why are the media really ramping this up as a potential national health scare?
[00:24:13.183 --> 00:24:15.085]  Something we really need to be concerned about.
[00:24:15.425 --> 00:24:19.949]  Why are they pushing out an experimental Ebola vaccine in September?
[00:24:20.409 --> 00:24:25.314]  Why does Obama all of a sudden grant himself new executive authority
[00:24:25.754 --> 00:24:30.377]  To detain and quarantine people who are showing Ebola-like symptoms.
[00:24:30.417 --> 00:24:40.903]  He already had the authority to quarantine and detain people showing symptoms of kind of flu-like symptoms, but now he specifically granted himself the authority with Ebola.
[00:24:41.264 --> 00:24:49.849]  Of course, then we have the CDC changing their website, updating it really to give the American people tips on how they can protect themselves and prevent
[00:24:50.369 --> 00:24:50.969]  I think so.
[00:25:10.714 --> 00:25:14.515]  Who stands to profit from a potential pandemic?
[00:25:14.915 --> 00:25:22.257]  Is it, you know, the same with the swine flu, where people who are creating this vaccine are going to be making all of this money?
[00:25:22.657 --> 00:25:30.219]  Speaking of vaccines, that experimental vaccine that the two American patients have been treated with, it seems to be helping them.
[00:25:30.359 --> 00:25:37.601]  In fact, that doctor who created that was actually one that was caught on video several years ago joking
[00:25:38.161 --> 00:25:45.605]  About wiping out the population of, you know, a large portion of the population with a GMO vaccine.
[00:25:45.985 --> 00:25:47.206]  He was kind of joking about that.
[00:25:47.286 --> 00:25:50.888]  So, you know, that could just be obviously a coincidence here.
[00:25:51.048 --> 00:25:59.693]  But the fact that Ebola is now being touted as something that could be wiping out large portions of the population, something that we really need to be concerned with,
[00:26:00.273 --> 00:26:06.619]  Like Christopher Palo said, turning something like Ebola into a bioweapon would be completely mental.
[00:26:06.959 --> 00:26:14.146]  You can't control it and it would wipe out 90% of the population if it was allowed to spread like wildfire.
[00:26:14.646 --> 00:26:25.676]  And just refer back to the Georgia Guidestones and something like Ebola wiping out the population is directly in line with the globalist plan to clean up the planet.
[00:26:26.337 --> 00:26:28.378]  So, I don't really know where to go with this.
[00:26:29.059 --> 00:26:30.860]  Presently, I would agree with Christopher.
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:31.801]  Educate yourself.
[00:26:32.261 --> 00:26:34.402]  Don't buy into the fear at this moment.
[00:26:34.462 --> 00:26:37.545]  Don't go lining up to get those experimental vaccines.
[00:26:38.325 --> 00:26:45.830]  But again, we're just going to have to do a little bit more research and find out what the endgame is with this current pandemic.
[00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:51.414]  Now, coming up right after this, we are going to be giving you an update on Jesse Ventura.
[00:26:53.134 --> 00:26:55.536]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:27:23.434 --> 00:27:27.236]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[00:27:27.656 --> 00:27:28.877]  I didn't, I taste dirt in it.
[00:27:28.917 --> 00:27:30.037]  God knows what's in this.
[00:27:30.177 --> 00:27:31.178]  This has an aftertaste.
[00:27:31.198 --> 00:27:32.799]  Tastes like Austin water?
[00:27:33.059 --> 00:27:33.499]  Yeah, it does.
[00:27:33.699 --> 00:27:33.899]  Ugh.
[00:27:33.959 --> 00:27:38.121]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[00:27:38.361 --> 00:27:44.464]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered through the ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[00:27:44.604 --> 00:27:45.425]  High quality H2O.
[00:27:45.445 --> 00:27:46.985]  That one is better.
[00:27:47.065 --> 00:27:48.046]  Tastes like nothing.
[00:27:48.326 --> 00:27:49.727]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[00:27:49.787 --> 00:27:50.287]  It's good water.
[00:27:50.387 --> 00:27:58.934]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, Monsanto's deadly pesticide, glyphosate, and many others.
[00:27:59.334 --> 00:28:06.840]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[00:28:07.121 --> 00:28:09.623]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[00:28:10.203 --> 00:28:12.547]  Yeah, there's that processed flavor to it.
[00:28:12.887 --> 00:28:22.461]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances and many more, leaving only fresh tasting, deliciously clean water.
[00:28:22.581 --> 00:28:24.023]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[00:28:24.043 --> 00:28:24.985]  It's good water.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.101]  Refreshing.
[00:28:26.541 --> 00:28:26.902]  It's good.

[00:29:02.233 --> 00:29:06.817]  Tonight, Jesse Ventura sets the record straight on the Chris Kyle lawsuit.
[00:29:07.157 --> 00:29:15.543]  This following an especially vindictive response by the media for Ventura's attempt to clear his name and save his reputation.
[00:29:16.144 --> 00:29:23.369]  So the jury yesterday found defamation of character, ordered Kyle's estate to pay Ventura 1.8 million dollars.
[00:29:23.409 --> 00:29:25.651]  Keep in mind, Mr. Kyle is dead.
[00:29:25.771 --> 00:29:33.858]  We have multiple sound bites, multiple quotes from Jesse Ventura, and, you know, comments against our own military and this nation.
[00:29:34.078 --> 00:29:41.805]  But it seems like the height of cruelty to punish the guy's wife, and that is what Jesse Ventura has done.
[00:29:41.825 --> 00:29:44.327]  I mean, everyone's jaw is dropped today.
[00:29:44.747 --> 00:29:51.068]  Now we all know Chris Kyle was a legendary Navy SEAL sniper who defamed Jesse Ventura in 2012.
[00:29:51.648 --> 00:30:01.110]  This was shortly after he released his book and he appeared on national television claiming that he actually punched Jesse Ventura in the face and knocked him out.
[00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:13.713]  This was in response to Jesse Ventura's allegedly walking around and bad-mouthing the Navy SEALs, not to mention bad-mouthing then President Bush and bad-mouthing America.
[00:30:14.153 --> 00:30:27.717]  Needless to say, Fox News and the rest of the establishment media had a field day with this story, but in typical mainstream fashion, they failed to look into all the circumstances surrounding the case, and they rushed to judgment.
[00:30:28.158 --> 00:30:38.601]  Either that, or this was an orchestrated character assassination against Ventura, who is known for his outspoken views and criticism of our corrupt government.
[00:30:39.301 --> 00:30:41.142]  So he was bad mouth in the war, right?
[00:30:41.803 --> 00:30:44.825]  Bad mouth in the war, bad mouth in Bush, bad mouth in America.
[00:30:45.185 --> 00:30:47.166]  This gentleman accused me of treason.
[00:30:48.147 --> 00:30:55.211]  And in the military, I being ex-military, in the military treason is a very serious crime.
[00:30:55.511 --> 00:30:57.993]  In the military, it carries the death sentence.
[00:30:58.353 --> 00:31:02.156]  And when you're accused of treason, you're going to fight it, which is what I did.
[00:31:02.576 --> 00:31:04.357]  Let's get a few facts straight here.
[00:31:04.777 --> 00:31:09.421]  I filed this lawsuit immediately when the book appeared in January of 2012.
[00:31:10.923 --> 00:31:12.484]  I had just gone to Mexico.
[00:31:12.644 --> 00:31:13.886]  I was off the grid.
[00:31:14.006 --> 00:31:17.189]  I had only communication was through the internet.
[00:31:17.569 --> 00:31:23.054]  And I learn of this book that comes out where he allegedly punched me out for me committing treason.
[00:31:23.849 --> 00:31:26.210]  So I immediately contacted my attorneys.
[00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:27.710]  I said, we have to stop this.
[00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:37.173]  And so we filed the lawsuit shortly in the latter part of January, 2012, when Chris Kyle was still very much alive.
[00:31:37.393 --> 00:31:44.415]  He would not do one thing to restore my reputation, and he would not admit that he made the story up.
[00:31:44.675 --> 00:31:47.256]  The only thing they would offer me was money.
[00:31:47.496 --> 00:31:51.177]  So if I wanted strictly money, I could have settled right there.
[00:31:52.182 --> 00:31:57.706]  I could have settled right there for just money, but I wanted and sought the truth.
[00:31:58.146 --> 00:31:59.827]  That's why it had to go to court.
[00:31:59.947 --> 00:32:04.910]  The lawsuit proceeded forward, and unfortunately, Mr. Kyle was killed.
[00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:07.292]  He met an untimely death and was murdered.
[00:32:07.984 --> 00:32:13.548]  Now, one of the big criticisms people tell me is I should have dropped the lawsuit right there.
[00:32:13.948 --> 00:32:26.236]  That wouldn't have cleared my name, and even when we continued from there on, no matter what evidence was going on, they refused to move one inch on restoring my reputation.
[00:32:26.296 --> 00:32:27.697]  They said it was off the table.
[00:32:27.997 --> 00:32:30.539]  At the time this alleged incident took place,
[00:32:31.219 --> 00:32:41.786]  I was 6 foot 4, 255, 260 pounds, I still had 19 and a half inch arms, and I was a pretty big man.
[00:32:41.966 --> 00:32:47.830]  And to believe that Chris Kyle could strike me in the face and not leave a mark?
[00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:52.092]  Yet Chris Kyle said they saw me on television with black eyes.
[00:32:52.733 --> 00:32:54.154]  Yet they could not produce.
[00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:57.262]  The television that showed me with a black eye.
[00:32:57.662 --> 00:33:02.665]  He said when he hit me, there were four people standing right next to me when I went down.
[00:33:03.166 --> 00:33:05.447]  Yet they produced none of those people.
[00:33:05.788 --> 00:33:13.173]  They had no witness during this trial who said, with any credibility, who said they saw me get hit.
[00:33:13.453 --> 00:33:18.377]  The jury saw the evidence and the jury concurred and believed the evidence.
[00:33:18.597 --> 00:33:22.439]  Yet you've got political pundits out there saying the jury's all wrong!
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:24.541]  The jury's full of crap!
[00:33:25.336 --> 00:33:27.939]  Yet these political pundits weren't in the trial.
[00:33:28.499 --> 00:33:29.821]  They know nothing about it.
[00:33:29.961 --> 00:33:33.224]  They don't know one fact about what was presented as evidence.
[00:33:34.005 --> 00:33:45.877]  Jesse Ventura should be thankful for the men and women in uniform who protect our freedoms, our capitalism, and who protect his ability to make a living with so little actual talent.
[00:33:47.167 --> 00:33:52.571]  Yeah, good for you, because he's taken food out of the mouths of Chris Kyle's children.
[00:33:52.611 --> 00:33:53.431]  Bernie!
[00:33:54.152 --> 00:33:55.833]  Is there any way to side with Jesse on this?
[00:33:56.093 --> 00:33:57.014]  No way, no way.
[00:33:57.054 --> 00:33:58.515]  He is a big loser.
[00:33:59.676 --> 00:34:01.137]  I'm ashamed to be bald right now.
[00:34:02.777 --> 00:34:08.360]  When you sue a widow and you get money out of her, that's the best way to restore your reputation.
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:12.062]  See, I just had to prove to everyone I'm not as bad of a guy as everyone says I am.
[00:34:12.102 --> 00:34:24.689]  The jury saw the evidence and the jury moved forward and ruled on the evidence and the jury found that I had been defamed and they had found there had been unjust enrichment.
[00:34:25.316 --> 00:34:31.198]  Because of that defamation, and they are the ones that awarded me the $1.8 million.
[00:34:31.458 --> 00:34:32.778]  I didn't control the money.
[00:34:32.798 --> 00:34:35.259]  I didn't control what I won.
[00:34:35.319 --> 00:34:37.020]  I didn't even control the charges.
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:44.862]  There were three charges that the federal judge, Kyle, no relation, allowed to continue forward on the bench.
[00:34:44.922 --> 00:34:48.023]  It was his professional judge's opinion.
[00:34:48.695 --> 00:34:51.977]  The jury got it and the jury made the award.
[00:34:51.997 --> 00:34:52.857]  I didn't.
[00:34:53.438 --> 00:35:10.267]  During this process and after Chris Kyle died, a petition was brought by former members of the UDT SEAL community to throw me out of the UDT SEAL Association for continuing to attempt to clear my name with this lawsuit.
[00:35:11.408 --> 00:35:15.710]  It broke my heart because there were people on that petition that I served with.
[00:35:16.605 --> 00:35:18.907]  And I was never given the benefit of the doubt.
[00:35:19.067 --> 00:35:20.768]  The truth was never even brought up.
[00:35:20.829 --> 00:35:24.411]  The truth wasn't even considered in this petition.
[00:35:25.172 --> 00:35:33.138]  No one even considered what if Jesse Ventura has the truth and Chris Kyle is lying, which is the truth.
[00:35:33.258 --> 00:35:37.422]  Chris Kyle did lie and Jesse Ventura did have the truth.
[00:35:37.962 --> 00:35:41.005]  But apparently to these people, the truth didn't matter.
[00:35:41.325 --> 00:35:44.828]  You know, I have an entire generation of young SEALs now who hate me.
[00:35:45.464 --> 00:35:46.585]  And I didn't do anything.
[00:35:47.546 --> 00:35:48.628]  I am a victim here.
[00:35:49.048 --> 00:35:52.972]  As much as many of you maybe don't want to believe that, it is the truth.
[00:35:53.232 --> 00:35:53.993]  I am a victim.
[00:35:54.394 --> 00:35:55.215]  I did nothing.
[00:35:55.955 --> 00:36:01.822]  And yet I had to go, me and my family, had to go through two and a half years of hell also.
[00:36:02.677 --> 00:36:07.959]  In facing the media and facing the insults and everything else that happens to you.
[00:36:08.359 --> 00:36:11.100]  But nobody thinks about my family or me.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:12.640]  I'm moving forward.
[00:36:13.101 --> 00:36:14.441]  This is in the past now.
[00:36:14.801 --> 00:36:16.362]  I will continue to move forward.
[00:36:16.702 --> 00:36:20.683]  I will continue to be Jesse Ventura, Governor, former Governor of Minnesota.
[00:36:21.023 --> 00:36:26.205]  And I will continue to be a vigilant citizen and hold my government's feet to the fire.
[00:36:26.605 --> 00:36:28.446]  This isn't going to change a thing.
[00:36:28.866 --> 00:36:29.387]  That's right.
[00:36:29.567 --> 00:36:33.090]  The jury saw the evidence and they ruled in favor of Jesse Ventura.
[00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:42.258]  Now, y'all need to wake up and understand just how dangerous this is when the mainstream press attacks you and they uniformly go after you.
[00:36:42.339 --> 00:36:44.881]  I mean, this is called character assassination.
[00:36:45.201 --> 00:36:53.229]  Because Ventura has the audacity to speak his mind and talk about the mega-corruption in our government, that makes him dangerous.
[00:36:53.789 --> 00:36:59.712]  And some of you are so blinded by false patriotism that you never even bothered to look up the facts.
[00:37:00.492 --> 00:37:06.074]  You heard the chorus of talking media heads dogpile on Ventura and you joined the herd.
[00:37:06.514 --> 00:37:14.818]  You know the father of propaganda, Edward Bernays, well he discovered that we humans have what he referred to as a herd mentality.
[00:37:15.158 --> 00:37:17.199]  By instinct we follow a herd.
[00:37:17.719 --> 00:37:26.187]  And of course the establishment knows this and they use the techniques and principles of crowd psychology to control and manipulate the masses.
[00:37:26.747 --> 00:37:30.450]  It's crowd control through propaganda and it's highly effective.
[00:37:30.851 --> 00:37:35.515]  And they go around basically regurgitating what they hear on the mainstream news.
[00:37:35.955 --> 00:37:38.598]  And when it comes to the Ventura Chris Kyle lawsuit...
[00:37:39.218 --> 00:37:39.759]  Think about it.
[00:37:40.239 --> 00:37:49.008]  A typical jury in the good ol' USA, you would think that they would tend to lean favorably towards a fallen war hero and his widow.
[00:37:49.548 --> 00:37:52.631]  Yet, the jury sided with Jesse Ventura.
[00:37:52.871 --> 00:37:54.373]  And that speaks volumes.
[00:37:55.481 --> 00:38:01.986]  Alright, and that was recorded earlier today in one of our many studios here in Austin, Texas.

[00:38:58.203 --> 00:39:05.547]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:39:05.707 --> 00:39:11.070]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.

[00:40:55.865 --> 00:41:03.853]  And finally tonight on InfoWars Nightly News, she spent the last five days with us down here in Austin, Texas, visiting us from Cleveland, Ohio.
[00:41:04.513 --> 00:41:06.655]  She's Michelle Dougherty, a.k.a.
[00:41:06.815 --> 00:41:15.644]  The Obama Phone Lady, and she's here with us as we try to get her idea on what the American Dream really stands for.
[00:41:16.264 --> 00:41:17.806]  And Michelle, what is the American Dream?
[00:41:18.834 --> 00:41:22.918]  The American dream is to push away from the government.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:27.483]  Get out and get you a, I got a bank account.
[00:41:28.164 --> 00:41:31.167]  I got, I'm on the right track in case I get my checks.
[00:41:31.287 --> 00:41:38.535]  I don't have to pay, you know, those crooked people six or seven or ten, twenty bucks to cash my check.
[00:41:39.035 --> 00:41:41.137]  Michelle, there's been a saying out there for a long time.
[00:41:41.958 --> 00:41:44.362]  And we call them cliches because they're so true.
[00:41:45.043 --> 00:41:47.226]  The more things change, the more they stay the same.
[00:41:47.767 --> 00:41:49.229]  There's nothing new under the sun.
[00:41:49.289 --> 00:41:50.771]  Power corrupts absolutely.
[00:41:51.773 --> 00:41:54.677]  You don't want to go out and catch fish for somebody.
[00:41:55.058 --> 00:41:57.000]  You want to teach a man or a woman how to fish.
[00:41:57.765 --> 00:41:58.145]  Right.
[00:41:58.345 --> 00:42:11.990]  And there's a lot you could teach me, a lot I could teach you, but the system, the political system that wants people domesticated under their control, they want to give you fish to run your life, not teach you how to go out and catch the fish yourselves.
[00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:12.650]  Right.
[00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:18.854]  You're absolutely right, because you know the way I was taught to go out and catch the fish myself?
[00:42:19.015 --> 00:42:21.016]  You know, I got a little grips on it now.
[00:42:21.476 --> 00:42:27.261]  I don't have to be waiting on something to come that might come or not come.
[00:42:27.321 --> 00:42:32.925]  You know, and on the government, you know, they cut everything, so you don't know if it's gonna come or it's not gonna come.
[00:42:32.965 --> 00:42:39.930]  So it's best to be independent, with your own job, with things to go, to get a bank account,
[00:42:42.313 --> 00:43:09.886]  Withdraw money when you need it, you know, not just waiting on the once in a month or like, you know What I was I was going through was a battle was when I get ready to get the little check I got a run around the cash it you know what I'm saying pay these people twelve or thirteen dollars to take out my Hundred fifty dollars just crazy stuff that the system have caught me up in so much of that, you know Well, I did not know they didn't teach you them the kind of things, you know, you had to go to the
[00:43:10.626 --> 00:43:11.927]  What we wanted to do was just to show
[00:43:32.538 --> 00:43:55.507]  The viewers out there and people that are unaware, who may have been better off where they were born or how they were brought up with their opportunities, to understand that the poorest working Americans are being preyed on by these payday loans and these places that take huge percentages of your check just to cash them when that check they're cashing is guaranteed and it's all computerized and they know the money's good.
[00:43:56.127 --> 00:43:57.668]  To go out and show people... Not to scam!
[00:43:57.748 --> 00:43:58.628]  They pimping us.
[00:43:58.748 --> 00:43:59.949]  They pimp you like that.
[00:44:00.109 --> 00:44:00.589]  Exactly.
[00:44:00.689 --> 00:44:13.854]  Show people how easy it is to get a bank account, how easy it is to go out and get some decent clothes inexpensively, how easy it is to try to, you know, go out and basically start over from square one to try to get out of the system.
[00:44:14.194 --> 00:44:16.075]  Because the goal is get out of the system.
[00:44:16.455 --> 00:44:20.637]  The establishment wants us institutionalized so that we're under their control.
[00:44:20.997 --> 00:44:23.978]  Went from my Obama phone to a new galaxy.
[00:44:25.253 --> 00:44:29.316]  Well, Obama, thanks for letting me use this phone for them couple years.
[00:44:29.896 --> 00:44:31.317]  I'll stick a fork in it.
[00:44:31.517 --> 00:44:32.638]  It's a done deal.
[00:44:33.359 --> 00:44:34.820]  You've been busy the last few days.
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:36.661]  I've been in there doing the radio show.
[00:44:37.101 --> 00:44:45.467]  I know some of my reporters and writers, like Anthony Gucciardi, have kind of taken you around town to try to get you out of the clutches of the system.
[00:44:45.527 --> 00:44:46.388]  Were they successful?
[00:44:46.428 --> 00:44:46.808]  How'd it go?
[00:44:47.048 --> 00:44:48.489]  Oh, it was beautiful.
[00:44:48.549 --> 00:44:49.930]  I was able to go swimming.
[00:44:50.371 --> 00:44:51.812]  Tell me about your trip to Barton Springs.
[00:44:52.792 --> 00:44:54.113]  Oh, I loved it.
[00:44:55.686 --> 00:45:01.191]  It was a really experience for a person have never been out to something like that.
[00:45:01.331 --> 00:45:01.511]  Wow.
[00:45:01.551 --> 00:45:04.474]  I've never seen a big pond like that.
[00:45:05.135 --> 00:45:09.639]  And it only cost three and four dollars and I could have stayed all day.
[00:45:09.679 --> 00:45:10.680]  You'd be a great sales lady.
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:12.161]  I heard folks love the Obama phone lady.
[00:45:12.361 --> 00:45:12.781]  Oh yeah.
[00:45:13.042 --> 00:45:14.003]  I'll sell your phone.
[00:45:14.043 --> 00:45:15.043]  No more Obama phone.
[00:45:15.063 --> 00:45:17.125]  You can get this one for a little small price.
[00:45:17.386 --> 00:45:17.826]  Exactly.
[00:45:18.326 --> 00:45:19.127]  It works a lot better, huh?
[00:45:19.147 --> 00:45:19.988]  A lot better.
[00:45:20.008 --> 00:45:21.729]  Doesn't go to the Mexican billionaire, Carlos Slim.
[00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:26.093]  I'm here to turn in this old Obama phone for a new one.
[00:45:26.614 --> 00:45:28.755]  After all this time, I'm upgrading.
[00:45:29.236 --> 00:45:30.657]  No more Obama phone.
[00:45:31.118 --> 00:45:32.399]  In my eyes, it's like...
[00:45:33.541 --> 00:45:44.344]  You know, the government have control of you when you're, you know, you put your name and you stay at the welfare building four, five, six hours a day, once a month, or whenever they tell you to come.
[00:45:44.584 --> 00:45:47.805]  My goal was to get off all of that stuff, you know?
[00:45:47.825 --> 00:45:50.186]  I got me a bank account now.
[00:45:50.606 --> 00:45:53.867]  I'm going to further my goal in getting a better job now.
[00:45:54.687 --> 00:45:55.927]  You know, it winged me off.
[00:45:56.027 --> 00:45:59.989]  It let me see that I don't have to depend on the government for the check.
[00:46:01.937 --> 00:46:04.998]  It's not gonna make it, you know, if I get it, if I don't.
[00:46:05.219 --> 00:46:07.139]  I don't need it anymore, you know.
[00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:09.781]  I haven't been getting it in 36 months.
[00:46:10.401 --> 00:46:16.204]  And you said you were gonna give us back those checks if you got a kid under 18, and it haven't did it.
[00:46:16.304 --> 00:46:18.145]  So, I mean, you know...
[00:46:19.085 --> 00:46:24.626]  It was real rough, but now, you know, I see the real world where I can get out and get a better job.
[00:46:25.146 --> 00:46:26.267]  It's like you labeled.
[00:46:26.487 --> 00:46:28.187]  You know, my name is Michelle.
[00:46:28.267 --> 00:46:29.987]  I get such amount a month.
[00:46:30.087 --> 00:46:31.908]  I get such amount of food stamps.
[00:46:32.468 --> 00:46:34.028]  It's like he pimped us.
[00:46:34.128 --> 00:46:40.030]  Cause you know, now that he said he was going to do things and he didn't do things, you know, what you going to do?
[00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:43.450]  Wait on him to make it go through where you're going to get the money?
[00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:45.831]  Or are you going to get a check if you got kids under 18?
[00:46:46.971 --> 00:46:48.253]  You can't rely on that.
[00:46:48.313 --> 00:46:51.637]  You have to, a little bit, go out and get it yourself.
[00:46:52.177 --> 00:46:52.578]  You know?
[00:46:52.598 --> 00:46:54.981]  You have to give up something to get something.
[00:46:55.181 --> 00:47:00.247]  So, I gave up a few things that I used to do, I don't do anymore, and this is what God blessed me.
[00:47:00.427 --> 00:47:02.490]  This is what I did on my own to get it.
[00:47:04.082 --> 00:47:28.000]  My goal in talking to you over the last two years or so, Michelle, was to try to get you to just at least see things from my angle a little bit about how prosperous people were, comparatively, whether they be poor whites or blacks, before the big welfare society came in, that sold itself as a panacea that was going to save everybody and create a utopia, but it's really done the opposite.
[00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:29.181]  It's created dependency.
[00:47:29.941 --> 00:47:31.542]  It's created rot in this country.
[00:47:32.342 --> 00:47:41.224]  It's created groups of people that would politically go along with anything because they saw their fate not governed by themselves, but by the state.
[00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:41.785]  Right.
[00:47:42.005 --> 00:47:44.305]  And I mean, that sounds like 1984 to me.
[00:47:44.626 --> 00:47:50.227]  Well, you know, it's been going on for a while because, you know, I have a son that's 25 and 23.
[00:47:51.127 --> 00:47:55.529]  And, you know, now with the younger kids, it's been really a rough
[00:47:56.744 --> 00:48:03.200]  Rough time with the, with the little, you know, my little kids that I have now been back in the day.
[00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:04.844]  And, you know, I'm not saying it was...
[00:48:05.993 --> 00:48:17.720]  Clinton or Obama, but, you know, when you work for a man and he say what he's gonna do, you respect him supposed to do what you say you're gonna do in a couple years, four years, five years, whatever it is.
[00:48:18.401 --> 00:48:24.705]  You know, and most of the black low minority are people that help you get in to be a president.
[00:48:24.805 --> 00:48:28.948]  You know, we still hanging on like you pimped us and didn't do anything.
[00:48:29.028 --> 00:48:29.688]  We're waiting.
[00:48:29.928 --> 00:48:32.170]  But the rich folks, unquote, unquote,
[00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:35.832]  They're just smooth selling with whatever you do.
[00:48:36.192 --> 00:48:37.693]  So don't get caught up in that.
[00:48:37.833 --> 00:48:45.457]  Well, Obama gave giant tax breaks to thousands of companies who promoted Obamacare but wanted to be exempt from it.
[00:48:45.937 --> 00:48:53.501]  So if a McDonald's doesn't have to give health care to their employees, what does that do to the other hamburger place that can't afford to do it?
[00:48:54.301 --> 00:48:55.562]  No one gets it, does it?
[00:48:56.573 --> 00:48:57.613]  It puts him out of business.
[00:48:57.753 --> 00:48:58.014]  Right.
[00:48:58.274 --> 00:49:03.916]  Or if Warren Buffett's the biggest recipient of the banker bailout money, why would he be lobbying for higher taxes then?
[00:49:04.656 --> 00:49:05.997]  Because he gets the tax money.
[00:49:06.077 --> 00:49:08.237]  Right, he gets some percentage out of it or something.
[00:49:08.257 --> 00:49:08.758]  Basically.
[00:49:08.818 --> 00:49:09.018]  Yeah.
[00:49:09.078 --> 00:49:19.522]  The ultra-rich are against the new money and the recently- But they already said, you know, just like some millionaires or people with money.
[00:49:20.393 --> 00:49:26.998]  For instance, that's living, they're set, they really, a lot of rich people, to me, that wasn't even on Obama.
[00:49:27.479 --> 00:49:37.367]  You know, I really believe that when Obama won, by his color and the person and his background, a lot of black, low-minority, poor people got him in there.
[00:49:38.268 --> 00:49:43.392]  You know, because we thought he was going to do more, or do better than the way we were living.
[00:49:44.264 --> 00:49:48.267]  You know, and I, you know, I wondered, you know, why you haven't seen none of this?
[00:49:48.367 --> 00:49:51.729]  Or why you didn't do nothing to try to help some of these people?
[00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:52.369]  Save us.
[00:49:52.449 --> 00:49:55.071]  I mean, not save us, but, you know, you gotta be like me.
[00:49:55.551 --> 00:49:57.853]  You gotta get out, get independent.
[00:49:59.025 --> 00:50:01.026]  You know, dress up and fight.
[00:50:01.086 --> 00:50:03.306]  It's like a war out here in life.
[00:50:03.366 --> 00:50:08.428]  You know, when you go for an interview, you got 20 people at the same interview, which don't catch their eye.
[00:50:08.868 --> 00:50:09.688]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:50:09.788 --> 00:50:19.332]  Take Martin Luther King, and we'll play a clip of him in one of his famous speeches talking about judge people on the character of their deeds, not on the color of their skin.
[00:50:19.712 --> 00:50:20.392]  I have a dream.
[00:50:20.932 --> 00:50:26.774]  My four little children will one day live in a nation where they will
[00:50:29.642 --> 00:50:31.426]  By the content of their character.
[00:50:31.847 --> 00:50:33.410]  I have a dream today!
[00:50:42.756 --> 00:50:55.082]  But it seems like under Obama we've seen that go full circle, where now it's all about he's black so black folks vote for him, and then Hispanics are supposed to only vote for people that are Hispanic, and then whites are supposed to only vote for people that are whites.
[00:50:55.802 --> 00:51:02.506]  I would vote for anybody that wanted to promote liberty, stop the NSA spying, restore the Second Amendment, restore sovereignty.
[00:51:03.006 --> 00:51:06.508]  I really care about what people believe and what they stand for.
[00:51:06.828 --> 00:51:07.788]  That's what I'm looking for.
[00:51:07.828 --> 00:51:08.609]  It's like a musician.
[00:51:09.403 --> 00:51:12.744]  If a musician is white and plays the drums great, I love them.
[00:51:13.185 --> 00:51:15.706]  If they're black and play the drums great, I love them.
[00:51:16.146 --> 00:51:24.689]  I don't care what color they are, if they play the guitar good, or they sing good like Marvin Gaye, or they sing good... Like Teddy Pendergrass?
[00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:28.871]  Absolutely, or George Jones, or anybody, or Waylon Jennings.
[00:51:29.471 --> 00:51:34.694]  I mean, it's all about resonating with that individual and what they stand for.
[00:51:35.074 --> 00:51:35.334]  Right.
[00:51:36.394 --> 00:51:37.635]  You haven't did too much for me.
[00:51:39.423 --> 00:51:42.886]  A lot of people during the first campaign in 2008 would say, I'm not going to pay for gas.
[00:51:42.906 --> 00:51:44.407]  I'm going to have to pay for housing.
[00:51:44.427 --> 00:51:45.467]  All that stuff went up.
[00:51:45.508 --> 00:51:46.568]  You're going to give it all to me.
[00:51:46.608 --> 00:51:47.849]  And he wouldn't say no, no, no.
[00:51:48.209 --> 00:51:49.310]  He would go along with that.
[00:51:50.051 --> 00:51:50.571]  But he didn't.
[00:51:51.112 --> 00:51:56.275]  But how does he give somebody a house or a car without taking it from somebody else, Michelle?
[00:51:58.857 --> 00:52:02.940]  I mean, George Soros did get most of his money through fraud and scams.
[00:52:03.321 --> 00:52:03.501]  Right.
[00:52:03.581 --> 00:52:05.082]  And Nazi collaborating to begin with.
[00:52:06.038 --> 00:52:12.700]  But I wouldn't even want to take all his money and redistribute it because it would set the precedent to take good people's money and redistribute it.
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:14.480]  It's so dangerous.
[00:52:14.841 --> 00:52:15.021]  Right.
[00:52:15.281 --> 00:52:16.281]  And I've had... Gotta watch it.
[00:52:16.621 --> 00:52:17.281]  Gotta watch it.
[00:52:17.441 --> 00:52:22.943]  I've had friends and family who had their little house, nothing fancy taken, by the IRS claiming they hadn't paid everything.
[00:52:24.107 --> 00:52:24.227]  Sure.
[00:52:46.715 --> 00:52:47.556]  Who's going to be for dinner?
[00:52:48.036 --> 00:52:48.356]  Sheep.
[00:52:49.077 --> 00:52:49.538]  Exactly.
[00:52:49.578 --> 00:52:52.520]  The two wolves are going to vote to eat the sheep.
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:59.226]  Now, the elite don't have a lot of people, so they play class warfare off with the poor people against the middle class.
[00:52:59.246 --> 00:53:10.717]  So you get the poor people with the ultra-rich taking down the middle class that actually keeps the economy going, and that hires the poor people, and that buys the things, and is a ladder up for the poor people.
[00:53:10.757 --> 00:53:11.738]  Historically, it's a fact.
[00:53:12.358 --> 00:53:17.900]  And historically, elites want to shut down middle classes because that's their enemy.
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:21.200]  Once they've got a giant poor mass, there's no ladder up.
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:22.121]  They control everybody.
[00:53:22.601 --> 00:53:36.905]  That's why you've got all the big billionaires, almost all of them, but a few, giving money for socialism, giving money for big government, not to make you free and empower you, but to just give you enough to just shut up and get out the way.
[00:53:36.985 --> 00:53:37.545]  Get out of the way.
[00:53:37.865 --> 00:53:38.105]  Right.
[00:53:38.485 --> 00:53:39.706]  That's exactly what they did.
[00:53:39.726 --> 00:53:41.046]  And see, I don't want that, Michelle.
[00:53:41.286 --> 00:53:41.747]  Me neither.
[00:53:41.807 --> 00:53:47.492]  I don't want to live in a country where 51% are bought off by the government and elite groups to enslave the other 49.
[00:53:47.953 --> 00:53:50.215]  We're in a limited democracy, a republic.
[00:53:51.445 --> 00:54:02.467]  Well sure, the majority votes for who we want in office, but they can't spy on us illegally, they can't take our guns, they can't take our kids without due process, they can't enslave us, they can't get rid of our sovereignty.
[00:54:03.228 --> 00:54:04.608]  So that's what a republic is.
[00:54:05.348 --> 00:54:09.349]  A republic is a limited democracy where everybody's right is protected.
[00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:12.450]  And we never truly fulfilled the ideas of the republic.
[00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:17.531]  Because you'd have 95% voting to enslave the 5% that were black.
[00:54:17.891 --> 00:54:18.171]  Right.
[00:54:18.191 --> 00:54:18.651]  Was that right?
[00:54:19.758 --> 00:54:19.998]  No.
[00:54:20.339 --> 00:54:25.103]  Was it right to have 95% voting to enslave the other group?
[00:54:25.883 --> 00:54:26.904]  No, that was not right.
[00:54:26.944 --> 00:54:32.889]  Well, then today we have a more modern form of it, where 51% vote to take the money of somebody else.
[00:54:33.310 --> 00:54:35.271]  But see, the big guys are never going to get caught like that.
[00:54:35.572 --> 00:54:37.693]  They're offshore tax-exempt, U.N.
[00:54:38.074 --> 00:54:39.155]  diplomatic immunity.
[00:54:39.415 --> 00:54:41.557]  They're not paying zero in most cases.
[00:54:42.057 --> 00:54:42.618]  Max 3%.
[00:54:43.458 --> 00:54:44.319]  Guess how much I pay?
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:45.840]  Probably high tax.
[00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:46.041]  40% federal.
[00:54:48.407 --> 00:54:54.392]  Not counting all the dozens of other tax, I paid close to 70%, 68% my accountant says in taxes.
[00:54:55.092 --> 00:54:56.473]  Imagine if I had more of that money.
[00:54:56.793 --> 00:55:00.916]  I wouldn't just have a bigger house, nicer things, more crew and fund the economy.
[00:55:01.016 --> 00:55:02.337]  I would have more people working here.
[00:55:02.737 --> 00:55:03.898]  I would have more reporters.
[00:55:04.038 --> 00:55:04.839]  I would have more money.
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:09.822]  But it's got to go to the government and then they decide where to spend it.
[00:55:11.297 --> 00:55:12.158]  Not the viewers.
[00:55:12.658 --> 00:55:21.946]  See, in a free, open society, people vote with their dollars of what the food they want, of the clothes they want, of the media they like or think is informative.
[00:55:22.206 --> 00:55:23.927]  And so you get real diversity in ideas.
[00:55:24.387 --> 00:55:25.368]  That's a true renaissance.
[00:55:25.929 --> 00:55:37.238]  But when government controls it, it only goes to select groups, like Carlos Slim for the Obama phones, or to the big insurance companies that wrote Obamacare to raise payroll taxes on poor people.
[00:55:37.478 --> 00:55:38.359]  I mean, what is your view?
[00:55:38.399 --> 00:55:39.820]  How do you see Obama going down?
[00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:40.540]  In history.
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:45.724]  Because for me, it's not just about bashing Obama because it's fun to do.
[00:55:46.324 --> 00:55:49.026]  I called for Bush's impeachment for the Iraq War and a lot more.
[00:55:49.706 --> 00:55:57.131]  It's about realizing he's the corporate front man, he's the pitch man for a fraud to con a bunch of people.
[00:55:57.511 --> 00:56:04.676]  Could John McCain or Mitt Romney have gotten this many cons through against minority groups as Obama got?
[00:56:04.996 --> 00:56:05.136]  No.
[00:56:06.744 --> 00:56:07.464]  I don't think so.
[00:56:07.825 --> 00:56:09.866]  I don't think a Romney would have got that many.
[00:56:10.246 --> 00:56:10.846]  I agree with you.
[00:56:11.166 --> 00:56:12.767]  He was out for the rich.
[00:56:13.408 --> 00:56:15.329]  So do you see the genius of Obama?
[00:56:15.949 --> 00:56:16.169]  No.
[00:56:16.489 --> 00:56:18.550]  I don't see no genius of Obama.
[00:56:19.111 --> 00:56:21.292]  That's why Wall Street gave him more money than Romney.
[00:56:22.017 --> 00:56:23.218]  Right, because he won, right?
[00:56:23.718 --> 00:56:29.461]  Well, because they knew he could game people more than he could get their agenda through.
[00:56:29.981 --> 00:56:30.201]  Right.
[00:56:30.261 --> 00:56:33.263]  You think the elite really care one way or the other what color the president is?
[00:56:33.283 --> 00:56:34.283]  No.
[00:56:34.443 --> 00:56:35.924]  These people are bringing down countries.
[00:56:36.424 --> 00:56:38.285]  These people are shipping the narcotics in.
[00:56:38.605 --> 00:56:40.026]  These people are laundering the money.
[00:56:40.346 --> 00:56:43.127]  These people rule the planet because they're scam artists.
[00:56:43.408 --> 00:56:46.889]  And the minute we wake up to that larger scam, Michelle, it's game over.
[00:56:47.209 --> 00:56:47.710]  It's over.
[00:56:48.610 --> 00:56:50.571]  So now it's over for Obama, right?
[00:56:51.011 --> 00:56:54.433]  Well, he'll leave, they'll bring in another puppet, and then they'll rehabilitate him.
[00:56:54.833 --> 00:56:55.573]  Oh, that's what it'll do.
[00:56:55.593 --> 00:56:57.054]  It'll go on and on and on.
[00:56:57.074 --> 00:56:58.454]  But when are they gonna stop that?
[00:56:58.615 --> 00:57:00.615]  I'm sure you went to a magic show when you were a kid.
[00:57:00.856 --> 00:57:01.136]  Yeah.
[00:57:02.056 --> 00:57:04.997]  And if you were five, six years old, you really thought he was pulling a rabbit out, didn't you?
[00:57:05.057 --> 00:57:05.578]  Right, right.
[00:57:05.638 --> 00:57:05.938]  I did.
[00:57:06.198 --> 00:57:06.518]  I did.
[00:57:06.798 --> 00:57:11.000]  But what about later when somebody tells you, no, there's really a trap door in the hat.
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:12.241]  And it go up under.
[00:57:13.641 --> 00:57:15.782]  Wow, that was the same way you told me to.
[00:57:15.922 --> 00:57:24.924]  Once we stop debating whether the rabbit's racist or whether the magician's racist or whether the magician's having sex with his assistant, that's all the big fake smoke and mirrors.
[00:57:25.445 --> 00:57:28.626]  Once we realize it's all a fraud, now we understand the trick.
[00:57:29.146 --> 00:57:29.406]  Alright.
[00:57:29.946 --> 00:57:33.147]  And my job is to get you and others to see the trick.
[00:57:34.286 --> 00:57:34.766]  I see it.
[00:57:35.207 --> 00:57:39.089]  It's fun to laugh at ourselves, get up, dust off, and keep it moving.
[00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:40.170]  At least you know to write.
[00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:42.011]  Fool me once, shame on you.
[00:57:42.591 --> 00:57:44.012]  Fool me twice, shame on me.
[00:57:44.672 --> 00:57:45.773]  And that's what it comes down to.
[00:57:45.993 --> 00:57:46.954]  And none of us have got it all.
[00:57:46.974 --> 00:57:48.455]  We're all learning more and more as it goes.
[00:57:48.555 --> 00:57:48.915]  It's true.
[00:57:49.075 --> 00:57:50.396]  But I would like nothing more.
[00:57:51.513 --> 00:57:57.755]  Then to see all the people out there in America come together and realize the corporate welfare is what's really going on.
[00:57:58.395 --> 00:58:01.676]  And that's why the corporate welfare people want the general public on welfare.
[00:58:01.956 --> 00:58:04.677]  Because then if you're getting a crumb, they can get the whole buffet.
[00:58:04.997 --> 00:58:05.237]  Right.
[00:58:05.377 --> 00:58:10.079]  See, they're getting the whole buffet, and we're saying, hey, middle class is saying, you don't need that buffet.
[00:58:11.199 --> 00:58:11.959]  We should have to pay for it.
[00:58:11.979 --> 00:58:14.460]  And they go, yeah, we're going to give some scraps to these people.
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:16.661]  You're going to vote for us to get the buffet, right?
[00:58:16.681 --> 00:58:18.681]  That's how it goes.
[00:58:18.701 --> 00:58:20.242]  So you guys get a crumb.
[00:58:21.397 --> 00:58:25.658]  Veterans get a crumb, but meanwhile, the big banks run the whole show.
[00:58:25.899 --> 00:58:26.479]  Run it all.
[00:58:26.859 --> 00:58:28.539]  We didn't get nothing.
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:31.901]  Even with the medical care, that's what I wanted to know.
[00:58:31.981 --> 00:58:34.121]  Some people got it and some people didn't.
[00:58:34.842 --> 00:58:39.103]  You know, like he said, all the people without medical, he's gonna make sure they got medical.
[00:58:39.603 --> 00:58:41.664]  I know some people today, they still don't have it.
[00:58:42.369 --> 00:58:42.709]  You know?
[00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:52.960]  But I bet them big shots and all them people around, like you say, the big nursing homes, the stores, the big Macy's and all, I bet they all got what they got for their workers.
[00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:53.820]  Well, here's how it works.
[00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:58.385]  Just like you've never been able to really get a bank account, we were finally able to help you do that by showing you how to jump through a few hoops.
[00:58:58.625 --> 00:58:58.966]  Yes.
[00:58:59.086 --> 00:59:00.787]  And then they used to make you run around town to all these...
[00:59:01.528 --> 00:59:03.710]  They told me I was going to check pace.
[00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:05.611]  But the lady said, check pace?
[00:59:05.631 --> 00:59:07.913]  We're going to cross that out.
[00:59:08.453 --> 00:59:09.154]  She told me.
[00:59:09.454 --> 00:59:11.736]  So see, those are the real forms of economic discrimination.
[00:59:11.896 --> 00:59:13.978]  You went all the way around to give me a bank account.
[00:59:14.258 --> 00:59:15.219]  To open a bank account.
[00:59:15.239 --> 00:59:16.159]  And so we jumped to the hoops.
[00:59:16.179 --> 00:59:17.140]  We got you the bank account now.
[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:18.421]  That's the beginning of building your credit.
[00:59:18.801 --> 00:59:21.063]  The beginning of getting off the economic plantation.
[00:59:21.664 --> 00:59:22.544]  Economic plantation.
[00:59:22.584 --> 00:59:26.067]  And that's really what it's all about, is gaming black, white, Hispanic.
[00:59:26.467 --> 00:59:27.088]  They don't care.
[00:59:27.708 --> 00:59:29.490]  And it's the same way with the corporate welfare.
[00:59:30.799 --> 00:59:41.667]  You can give, on average, a couple thousand dollars to a House or Senate member, and you can get hundreds of thousands back in government contracts, loans, loan guarantees, bailouts.
[00:59:42.267 --> 00:59:44.689]  You give a million bucks, you might get a billion dollars back.
[00:59:44.969 --> 00:59:45.209]  Right.
[00:59:45.409 --> 00:59:47.291]  The more you put in, the more you get back.
[00:59:47.491 --> 00:59:50.453]  That's the issue, and so we've become a mafia-based economy.
[00:59:51.994 --> 00:59:52.594]  That's bad.
[00:59:53.395 --> 00:59:54.696]  That's bad business, man.
[00:59:55.387 --> 00:59:57.268]  They gotta do something about that.
[00:59:57.348 --> 01:00:03.012]  They frame you to get you somewhere, you know, and then just let you lay out there like that.
[01:00:03.452 --> 01:00:06.595]  Did you know Obama's supporters are some of the biggest slumlords in America?
[01:00:06.835 --> 01:00:07.375]  I believe you.
[01:00:07.735 --> 01:00:14.180]  Just like I go to church, some of the people at church, they're on property, and people tell me they're the biggest slumlords.
[01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:14.820]  There he is.
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:15.861]  I really believe that.
[01:00:16.181 --> 01:00:22.766]  Because I believe the people that got everything, what they care about us down here that's suffering or don't have anything.
[01:00:23.267 --> 01:00:25.589]  You know, back in the day, you help me, I help you.
[01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:29.712]  Now, if you stick a fork in it, I'll stick one right after you, you know?
[01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:31.373]  Whatever it is, you know?
[01:00:32.414 --> 01:00:32.734]  That's right.
[01:00:32.754 --> 01:00:34.856]  We're becoming a very barbarous society.
[01:00:35.457 --> 01:00:44.324]  And elites that stop caring about the general public and who go to a purely corrupt system always have planted the seeds of their own destruction.
[01:00:45.126 --> 01:00:46.788]  And we're not going to have to wait for these seeds to grow.
[01:00:46.828 --> 01:00:47.669]  They've already grown.
[01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:49.271]  And they out of hand.
[01:00:49.291 --> 01:00:50.672]  Into a thicket of corruption.
[01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:51.193]  Right.
[01:00:51.373 --> 01:00:53.075]  And judgment day is coming.
[01:00:53.215 --> 01:00:54.096]  You know what it is.
[01:00:54.136 --> 01:00:55.438]  You know what you got facing.
[01:00:55.558 --> 01:00:56.719]  You know what you didn't do.
[01:00:56.779 --> 01:00:57.980]  What you said you was going to do.
[01:00:58.001 --> 01:00:58.881]  Now you're there.
[01:00:59.082 --> 01:01:00.063]  What can you do?
[01:01:00.403 --> 01:01:03.787]  Well, what they're doing is bringing in a whole other group of people they can con one more time.
[01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:04.047]  Right.
[01:01:04.227 --> 01:01:05.189]  All the poor illegals.
[01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:07.511]  They ain't gonna give me no more.
[01:01:29.125 --> 01:01:30.246]  Not just the Democrats.
[01:01:30.706 --> 01:01:30.926]  Right.
[01:01:31.046 --> 01:01:35.308]  Especially when not just the Democrats did it, the Republicans did too, right?
[01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:37.450]  They're all at the top working together.
[01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:38.730]  All in it together.
[01:01:39.110 --> 01:01:39.471]  You're right.
[01:01:39.491 --> 01:01:41.372]  Michelle, anything else you want to add to Nominally News?
[01:01:42.232 --> 01:01:42.952]  I really lose.
[01:01:43.173 --> 01:01:46.134]  I really enjoy being on Infowars.com.
[01:01:46.274 --> 01:01:54.999]  It really gave me a good idea of life on life terms, you know, and taking it not depending on government
[01:01:56.195 --> 01:01:58.577]  No more Obama phone, no more Obama phone, I have a GXX.
[01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:16.313]  Here I am again, Obama phone lady.
[01:02:16.353 --> 01:02:20.658]  What we need is people to teach us how to fish and not to give us fish.
[01:02:20.939 --> 01:02:22.420]  Teach us how to fish!
[01:02:22.601 --> 01:02:27.247]  And you're going to do more because you're going to be independent on your own self, not the president.
[01:02:27.547 --> 01:02:31.432]  Plus, catching your own fish and running your own life is very fun.
[01:02:32.648 --> 01:02:34.989]  Now I'll see you soon, Obama Phone Lady!
[01:02:35.549 --> 01:02:38.890]  Well that's what it's all about here at InfoWars.com, the nightly news.
