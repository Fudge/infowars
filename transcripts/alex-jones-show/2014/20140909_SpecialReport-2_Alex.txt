[00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:08.883]  Well, have you talked to the school nurse?
[00:00:09.363 --> 00:00:10.804]  No, she doesn't know anything.
[00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:12.925]  Will you just come get me?
[00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:12.985]  No.
[00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:16.507]  Well, will you do me a favor then?
[00:00:16.527 --> 00:00:17.287]  What?
[00:00:17.307 --> 00:00:19.588]  Can you bring me my chapstick?
[00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:21.149]  No, Napoleon.
[00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:23.010]  But my lips hurt real bad!
[00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.851]  I just bought some from the school nurse.
[00:00:24.911 --> 00:00:26.892]  I know she has like five sticks in her drawer.
[00:00:26.912 --> 00:00:28.713]  I'm not gonna use hers, you sicko!
[00:00:29.754 --> 00:00:30.154]  See ya.
[00:00:31.615 --> 00:00:31.755]  Ugh!
[00:00:33.296 --> 00:00:33.636]  Idiot!
[00:00:34.668 --> 00:00:39.511]  As bizarre as that scene was, a similar event has now actually taken place.
[00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:44.854]  In Virginia, an 11-year-old was told that she couldn't have ChapStick without a doctor's note.
[00:00:45.427 --> 00:00:49.769]  And even if she did produce the prescription, the nurse would have to apply it for her.
[00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:53.531]  It seems that zero tolerance also applies to common sense.
[00:00:54.011 --> 00:01:01.475]  And let us not forget the case of the infamous Pop-Tart gun, where a boy in Maryland was suspended after eating his pastry the wrong way.
[00:01:01.955 --> 00:01:06.397]  A school staffer claims that the boy used the gun to imitate a gun sound.
[00:01:06.977 --> 00:01:08.078]  And so what if he did?
[00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:09.820]  But there is hope, though.
[00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:16.448]  Sixth graders in Arkansas were given the task of deciding which of our God-given rights the government should allow us to have.
[00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.054]  So if I lose my right to bear arms, hopefully I'll gain my right to bear lip balm.
