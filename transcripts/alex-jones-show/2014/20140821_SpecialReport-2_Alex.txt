[00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.253]  Governor Rick Perry was booked in the Travis County Jail today for two felony counts of abuse of power.
[00:00:13.573 --> 00:00:22.459]  All of this because he refused $7.5 million to the office of the Travis County DA after Rosemary Lemberg was caught driving under the influence back in 2013.
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.561]  You think I'm not gonna pull over?
[00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:27.442]  No, I'm aware of who you are, ma'am.
[00:00:27.602 --> 00:00:30.963]  I went to a friend's house tonight.
[00:00:31.183 --> 00:00:31.423]  Okay.
[00:00:31.483 --> 00:00:32.384]  Had a cup of drink.
[00:00:32.724 --> 00:00:33.704]  I am not drunk.
[00:00:34.105 --> 00:00:36.366]  Governor Perry spoke to the crowd for five minutes.
[00:00:36.546 --> 00:00:39.567]  I'm here today because I believe in the rule of law.
[00:00:41.068 --> 00:00:48.471]  And I'm here today because I did the right thing.
[00:00:52.096 --> 00:01:02.198]  I'm going to enter this courthouse with my head held high, knowing the actions that I took were not only lawful and legal, but right.
[00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:09.700]  And if I had to do so, I would veto funding for the Public Integrity Unit again.
[00:01:16.422 --> 00:01:20.043]  You think, think any governor
[00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:37.414]  Democrat or Republican would expect this important unit with jurisdiction over state officials be led by someone who lives up to the highest standards of conduct and personal integrity.
[00:01:39.596 --> 00:01:42.799]  And this issue is far bigger than me.
[00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.362]  It's about the rule of law.
[00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:58.969]  It's about the Constitution that allows not just a governor but every citizen to speak their mind free of political interference or legal intimidation.
[00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:08.372]  This indictment is nothing short of an attack on the constitutional powers of the office of governor.
[00:02:09.653 --> 00:02:15.815]  There are important fundamental issues at stake and I will not allow
[00:02:16.707 --> 00:02:20.289]  This attack on our system of government to stand.
[00:02:27.492 --> 00:02:32.634]  I'm gonna fight this injustice with every fiber of my being.
[00:02:34.935 --> 00:02:36.076]  And we will prevail.
[00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.903]  And we'll prevail because we're standing for the rule of law.
[00:02:50.565 --> 00:02:55.770]  Returning 10 minutes later to the crowd, Perry now faced a maximum penalty of 99 years in prison.
[00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:09.200]  As required by law, I reported to the county authorities a few minutes ago, and I want to take a moment to say thank you to the sheriff's deputies
[00:03:10.362 --> 00:03:14.606]  And for the great professionalism that they showed me just now.
[00:03:17.348 --> 00:03:18.169]  Let me be clear.
[00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.855]  It is our system of constitutional checks and balances that is being challenged here today.
[00:03:26.936 --> 00:03:39.046]  This prosecution would seek to erode the power of all Texas governors, Republican or Democrat, to veto legislation
[00:03:39.685 --> 00:03:42.786]  and funding that they deem inappropriate.
[00:03:43.647 --> 00:03:48.409]  It is a chilling restraint on the right of free speech.
[00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.552]  The actions that I took were lawful, they were legal, and they were proper.
[00:03:57.833 --> 00:04:08.678]  This indictment is fundamentally a political act that seeks to achieve at the courthouse what could not be achieved at the ballot box.
[00:04:22.182 --> 00:04:27.845]  But we don't resolve political disputes or policy differences by indictments.
[00:04:28.885 --> 00:04:33.128]  We don't criminalize political or policy disagreements.
[00:04:35.269 --> 00:04:36.690]  We will prevail.
[00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.791]  We will prevail.
[00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.771]  And will prevail because the rule of law will prevail.
[00:04:51.751 --> 00:05:05.495]  I remain focused on the work of the people of this state, doing the job I was elected to do, and I will not be distracted by these baseless political charges.
[00:05:05.795 --> 00:05:06.835]  Thank you and God bless you.
[00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:19.032]  The Globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:05:19.292 --> 00:05:21.253]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:05:24.295 --> 00:05:28.317]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:05:28.637 --> 00:05:31.778]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:05:31.798 --> 00:05:39.102]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:05:39.262 --> 00:05:43.404]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:05:43.584 --> 00:05:45.245]  We are the true media.
[00:05:45.385 --> 00:05:47.966]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:05:48.066 --> 00:05:51.688]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
