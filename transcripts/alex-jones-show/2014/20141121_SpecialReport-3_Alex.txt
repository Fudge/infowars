[00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:12.692]  The laws governing the immigration system aren't working.
[00:00:14.574 --> 00:00:15.515]  The system is broken.
[00:00:15.535 --> 00:00:19.799]  I do hope there is a positive resolution to the debate.
[00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:28.848]  We must remember that the vast majority of immigrants are decent people who work hard and support their families and practice their faith.
[00:00:29.488 --> 00:00:30.969]  And leave responsible lives.
[00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.851]  This is how absurd this has become under the Bush administration.
[00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:40.995]  Because you know, there is a smart way to protect our borders, and there is a dumb way to protect our borders.
[00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:45.818]  So I would have a review, I would listen to the people who live along the border.
[00:00:45.938 --> 00:00:48.980]  Well this is an area where Senator Clinton and I almost entirely agree.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.162]  I think that the key is to consult with local communities.
[00:00:52.262 --> 00:00:54.343]  The Bush administration is not real good at listening.
[00:00:54.563 --> 00:00:55.644]  That's not what they do well.
[00:00:56.204 --> 00:00:57.066]  This isn't theater.
[00:00:57.086 --> 00:00:57.506]  This is a problem.
[00:00:57.546 --> 00:00:58.608]  I'm not interested in...
[00:01:10.723 --> 00:01:11.184]  Photo ops.
[00:01:11.764 --> 00:01:24.678]  Every time he opens his mouth about immigration and what he's gonna do, there's a huge negative impact on us that live out here along the border, especially in the rural areas where all the smuggling trails are.
[00:01:24.778 --> 00:01:27.581]  They wish I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself.
[00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:30.764]  But that's not how democracy works.
[00:01:31.388 --> 00:01:36.311]  A spokeswoman for the Davidson County Sheriff's Office said you said it was in this country illegally.
[00:01:36.551 --> 00:01:41.313]  Gurau Aguilar faces three counts of aggravated sexual battery of a person under the age of 13.
[00:01:42.094 --> 00:01:45.556]  Jacobo Gurau faces one count of rape of a person under the age of 13.
[00:01:45.596 --> 00:01:51.939]  Police believe 19-year-old Sergio Perez, an illegal immigrant, attacked the woman in her home Sunday.
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:59.587]  418 children were raped by illegals in the state of North Carolina in the month of August 2014 alone.
[00:02:00.007 --> 00:02:06.473]  If he tells the Department of Homeland Security how to process people when they want to come in the country, he can do that.
[00:02:06.514 --> 00:02:07.635]  He runs the executive branch.
[00:02:08.215 --> 00:02:18.566]  But if he tells Homeland Security and Border Patrol, look the other way when illegals come in, that is violating his oath because it's a failure to enforce the law and he took an oath to uphold the law.
[00:02:18.907 --> 00:02:29.678]  So if the practical effect of his executive order is the opposite of what the law requires, I hate to say this, Republicans don't want to do it and I understand why, he's a candidate for impeachment.
[00:02:29.878 --> 00:02:36.462]  Well, look, in my view, we need to be a nation that welcomes and celebrates legal immigrants.
[00:02:36.522 --> 00:02:39.824]  People who follow the rules, but at the same time, rule of law matters.
[00:02:39.884 --> 00:02:44.726]  And if you look at any sovereign nation, securing your border is critically important.
[00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:45.807]  If you come down to Texas,
[00:02:46.488 --> 00:03:00.910]  You see photographs that are heartbreaking because they entrust themselves to transnational global criminal cartels to secure the borders and then improve and streamline legal immigration so people can come to America consistent with the rule of law.
[00:03:01.684 --> 00:03:04.265]  Who was talking the talk, and who walked the walk?
[00:03:04.925 --> 00:03:14.548]  Because I walked, and the folks from Chicago know that I was on television talking about making sure that we got a humane and comprehensive immigration policy.
[00:03:14.608 --> 00:03:19.549]  I didn't run away from the issue, and I didn't just talk about it in front of Latino audiences.
[00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:22.990]  That's something that I think we should remember.
[00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.210]  There are a few examples.
[00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:30.352]  Believe me, the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting.
[00:03:34.682 --> 00:03:37.604]  I promise you, not just on immigration reform.
[00:03:41.926 --> 00:03:47.670]  But that's not how our system works.
[00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.751]  That's not how our democracy functions.
[00:03:51.492 --> 00:03:53.513]  That's not how our Constitution is written.
[00:03:54.093 --> 00:03:55.234]  We're defined by a creed.
[00:03:55.254 --> 00:03:57.215]  An idea.
[00:03:59.776 --> 00:04:02.818]  And we want that tradition to continue, but too often we're losing talent
[00:04:04.881 --> 00:04:10.647]  Because after the enormous investment we make in students and young researchers, we tell them to go home.
[00:04:11.688 --> 00:04:20.718]  Part of staying competitive in a global economy is making sure that we have an immigration system that doesn't send away talent, but attracts it.
[00:04:21.318 --> 00:04:23.821]  We want them to initiate new discoveries and start businesses.
[00:04:23.841 --> 00:04:27.545]  So that's what I'll be talking about a little bit tonight.
[00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.761]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
