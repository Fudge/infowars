[00:00:08.134 --> 00:00:15.643]  Twitter has announced that it's actively suspending accounts that share graphic images or footage of the alleged beheading of the American journalist James Foley.
[00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:22.632]  An online campaign was quickly launched calling for a blackout of the group, saying don't share video, give them nothing.
[00:00:22.972 --> 00:00:25.696]  YouTube has also repeatedly pulled the video down.
[00:00:25.936 --> 00:00:33.983]  British police have actually warned the public that just watching the James Foley video may be a criminal offense under terrorism legislation.
[00:00:34.243 --> 00:00:42.010]  And a journalist should not be committing an act of terrorism for merely viewing a video for investigative or reporting purposes.
[00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:47.275]  Of course, British authorities aren't going to pursue everyone who watches or disseminates the video.
[00:00:47.595 --> 00:00:50.398]  But threats, combined with selective enforcement,
[00:00:50.882 --> 00:00:56.183]  We'll set the pretext that governments can decide what information is off-limits to the general public.
[00:00:56.504 --> 00:01:03.165]  ISIS has had great success on social media, easily sharing their graphic images and extremist ideology.
[00:01:03.505 --> 00:01:09.467]  Now, in one respect, it is important to deny this PR-savvy terror group the celebrity that they desire.
[00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:19.910]  But on the other hand, it is only through viewing these horrific acts that people will actually grasp the sheer terror that this group is capable of and committing on a daily basis.
[00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.831]  So why censor now?
[00:01:22.431 --> 00:01:32.417]  Twitter didn't remove any of the graphic images making the rounds for more than a year now of Christians, Iraqis, Syrians, soldiers and others slaughtered by ISIS.
[00:01:32.898 --> 00:01:37.080]  And that's why censorship of the James Foley video is so concerning.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:45.605]  In terms of brutality, the video pales in comparison to all the other gruesome images and videos that have been posted by this terrorist organization.
[00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:48.227]  Yet it is the James Foley video
[00:01:48.527 --> 00:01:51.409]  That Obama says shocks the consciousness of the world.
[00:01:52.330 --> 00:02:03.139]  Censoring the video creates a pretext that governments can declare any content whatsoever on the internet to be extremist in nature and therefore off-limits to the general public.
[00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:12.226]  And recall that the government recently declared that liberty lovers and patriots and tea partiers were people holding extremist ideology.
[00:02:12.406 --> 00:02:16.590]  So are they setting the precedent that any political content posted by these groups could be censored?
[00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.375]  The video of this alleged murder is already being exploited by the state so it can ramp up re-intervention in Iraq.
[00:02:23.495 --> 00:02:28.479]  When people harm Americans anywhere, we do what's necessary to see that justice is done.
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:39.729]  The United States and its partners will capitalize on popular outrage over ISIS, stepping up their bombing campaign using this video as a convenient and powerful propaganda tool.
