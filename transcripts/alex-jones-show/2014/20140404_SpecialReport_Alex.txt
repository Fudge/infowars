[00:00:08.373 --> 00:00:08.874]  The U.S.
[00:00:08.934 --> 00:00:14.902]  government created a secret social media platform aimed at taking down Cuba's communist government.
[00:00:15.303 --> 00:00:18.508]  With the recent introduction of cell phone use in Cuba, U.S.
[00:00:18.568 --> 00:00:22.533]  officials saw the perfect opportunity to reach hundreds of thousands on the island.
[00:00:22.994 --> 00:00:24.957]  The plan was to launch a Cuban Twitter.
[00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:26.117]  We're good to go.
[00:00:48.462 --> 00:00:53.104]  Mass gatherings called at a moment's notice that might trigger a Cuban Spring.
[00:00:53.545 --> 00:00:58.747]  This was incredibly dangerous for the some 40,000 young Cubans who were interacting with the platform.
[00:00:59.187 --> 00:01:05.971]  They had no idea that the messages they thought were uninfluenced by their government were in fact financed by the U.S.
[00:01:06.011 --> 00:01:08.152]  government and influenced by its agenda.
[00:01:08.852 --> 00:01:12.974]  Social media platforms like Twitter have aided uprisings in several countries.
[00:01:13.334 --> 00:01:16.556]  And in 2011, Hillary Clinton admitted the U.S.
[00:01:16.636 --> 00:01:20.878]  helped people in oppressive Internet environments get around filters.
[00:01:21.438 --> 00:01:25.920]  There's no telling how many of these uprisings have been financed and influenced by the U.S.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:26.340]  government.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.621]  But while the U.S.
[00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:36.725]  government admits that social media is a powerful tool in taking down regimes overseas, it wouldn't like to see technology having that same effect here in America.
[00:01:37.145 --> 00:01:47.119]  That's why every year we're seeing legislation like SOPA, CISPA and PIPA, as well as the executive order signed by Obama that gives him the authority to shut down the Internet.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.868]  Instruments to fight the enemy abroad are now being used as tools of tyranny here in America.
[00:01:53.148 --> 00:01:56.390]  Tanks used for war are now being brought to our streets.
[00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:04.675]  Urban warfare training has increased at home, and we are being openly propagandized to thanks to last year's reform of the Smith Month Act.
[00:02:05.055 --> 00:02:17.403]  The lifting of the propaganda ban will now allow a vast ocean of programming by Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and other media, which is now heard in over a hundred countries, to be heard here at home as well.
[00:02:17.783 --> 00:02:21.726]  Talk radio is and was the original alternative media.
[00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:31.030]  When print was controlled, when the TV was controlled, only three channels, it was talk radio where people could call in and talk about things.
[00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.152]  And so many stories would break regionally that would end up becoming very important.
[00:02:35.172 --> 00:02:37.873]  And it was the place that could change what was happening legislatively.
[00:02:38.253 --> 00:02:42.435]  Government, tyrants in government, have always feared talk radio.
[00:02:43.097 --> 00:02:44.558]  And they're doing everything they can to kill it now.
[00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:53.087]  And in response to a government losing the info war, NSA champion Mike Rogers will be coming to a radio station near you.
