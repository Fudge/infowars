[00:00:00.492 --> 00:00:03.101]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:16.055 --> 00:00:16.716]  Big Brother.
[00:00:17.376 --> 00:00:18.397]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:19.138 --> 00:00:20.239]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.701]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:23.382]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:27.647]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.227 --> 00:00:32.291]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.254 --> 00:00:50.193]  What we see happening is powerful financial institutions globally that are able to create money out of thin air for themselves using communist systems of political management against
[00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.467]  Not just the people of the United States, but the world.
[00:00:53.847 --> 00:00:56.127]  But it's not a communist conspiracy.
[00:00:57.147 --> 00:01:06.470]  It is liberation theology, class warfare tactics being used by crony capitalists that are best described as fascist.
[00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.551]  I absolutely must get to all the news today.
[00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:13.951]  There is so much of it.
[00:01:15.132 --> 00:01:15.832]  So important.
[00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:26.426]  We have former Congressman Bob Barr, who was way ahead in polls, and was clearly going to win in Georgia, and did not win, and a Tea Party favorite won.
[00:01:27.427 --> 00:01:34.350]  So, for the people of Georgia, I guess he wasn't even hardcore enough for them, though he made some mistakes in Congress.
[00:01:34.851 --> 00:01:36.492]  He is not an unknown quantity.
[00:01:37.518 --> 00:01:41.802]  Fought against the NSA spying, the police state, gun control.
[00:01:41.962 --> 00:01:51.391]  I mean, I'd give Bob Barr an A-plus rating, and I'd take the Bob Barr I've known for 17, 18 years, probably over the guy that beat him, but hey, that's fine.
[00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:57.577]  It just shows perception, and even somebody like Bob Barr got beat out by a Tea Party candidate.
[00:01:58.397 --> 00:02:01.800]  Bob Barr is going to be joining us to talk about Ferguson.
[00:02:02.904 --> 00:02:08.685]  The clear race riots the Democratic Party is trying to start, and where he thinks that's going, and a host of other issues.
[00:02:09.165 --> 00:02:26.629]  So former Congressman Bob Barr, also formerly a federal prosecutor, and also formerly in special operations of the CIA, he will be joining us coming up today to also look at Obama's imperial presidency.
[00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:30.450]  Barr had sworn to begin impeachment proceedings
[00:02:31.983 --> 00:02:34.985]  When he got into office, that's why I was very happy.
[00:02:35.425 --> 00:02:38.468]  You know who started impeachment last time with David Shippers?
[00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.010]  Who we also have on the broadcast.
[00:02:43.131 --> 00:02:43.751]  It was Bob Barr.
[00:02:44.752 --> 00:02:49.315]  So I wanted him to get back into Congress because I knew he would go after Obama.
[00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:52.577]  You can't just leave Obama in there.
[00:02:53.938 --> 00:02:55.680]  He's going to pull a bunch of dirty tricks.
[00:02:56.721 --> 00:03:02.205]  The globalists want to go with this liberation theology, racial division move.
[00:03:03.906 --> 00:03:05.367]  And it is thoroughly disgusting.
[00:03:05.427 --> 00:03:17.635]  The NFL, the Congressional Black Caucus, putting their hands up, big demonstrations all over, where it's being implied that all police killed Brown.
[00:03:18.956 --> 00:03:23.659]  And I was watching videos in New York and other cities as people walked by the police, hatefully looking at them.
[00:03:25.202 --> 00:03:26.983]  Like they were just total scum.
[00:03:29.144 --> 00:03:31.785]  I'm the guy that made four films against the police state.
[00:03:32.326 --> 00:03:35.427]  I'm the guy that constantly criticizes bad police.
[00:03:36.107 --> 00:03:38.769]  You don't change it though just saying kill them all.
[00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:46.793]  You play right into the globalist plan to get them into their own gang mentality and it is outrageous what's happening.
[00:03:48.117 --> 00:04:03.024]  This is a huge double cross because when they're done demonizing the police, they're going to play out scenarios of civil war and attacks on police departments that are going to legitimize the paramilitary use of police against the Republic.
[00:04:03.664 --> 00:04:06.225]  And then the real civil war kicks off.
[00:04:08.086 --> 00:04:15.269]  So this is an attempt, as I've been saying for 15 years, since I figured this out, but intensely the last six or seven, that they're going operational,
[00:04:16.872 --> 00:04:22.194]  With the globalists building up the police state and then blaming the average cop for that, when it's everybody's to blame.
[00:04:22.894 --> 00:04:24.974]  And then playing us off against each other in a war.
[00:04:25.455 --> 00:04:30.416]  And I know, like a parrot, I covered that five, six times an hour yesterday, because I'm so worried about it.
[00:04:30.736 --> 00:04:31.937]  I'm not going to obsess on that.
[00:04:31.957 --> 00:04:35.858]  I'm going to mainly just look at the race ban that's going on and how outrageous it is.
[00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:38.040]  It's truly sickening.
[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.723]  And CNN, Time Magazine, MSNBC saying, hey, it's good to riot, it's legitimate.
[00:04:44.864 --> 00:04:47.086]  Louis Farrakhan and others saying, yeah, go ahead and target whites.
[00:04:48.306 --> 00:04:48.967]  That's crazy.
[00:04:51.348 --> 00:04:52.729]  You like the Bosnian guy?
[00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.892]  Who I guarantee has no connection to slavery in this country.
[00:04:57.652 --> 00:04:59.734]  Barely speaks English, getting his head clubbed in by hammers.
[00:05:02.834 --> 00:05:03.574]  By black folks?
[00:05:03.674 --> 00:05:04.975]  I mean, really, Farrakhan?
[00:05:05.855 --> 00:05:06.136]  Really?
[00:05:06.156 --> 00:05:08.296]  He deserved to have his head clubbed in?
[00:05:11.218 --> 00:05:16.620]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:05:17.861 --> 00:05:22.623]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:05:23.003 --> 00:05:29.726]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:05:31.724 --> 00:05:33.829]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:05:35.813 --> 00:05:38.139]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[00:05:49.888 --> 00:05:51.749]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:53.529]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:56.370]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:02.951]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:06:03.311 --> 00:06:05.512]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:06:06.012 --> 00:06:07.452]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:06:07.612 --> 00:06:08.053]  Got it.
[00:06:08.393 --> 00:06:09.253]  Others don't.
[00:06:10.612 --> 00:06:14.895]  For months, the Infowars Live Silver Bullet colloidal silver has been completely sold out.
[00:06:15.155 --> 00:06:20.259]  Now, we have finally procured a limited supply from one of the leading manufacturers of nutraceuticals in the nation.
[00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:22.300]  But here's what's truly exciting.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:32.747]  While we could simply sell the survival silver for its already discounted shelf price, we have decided to give back to you, the listeners, who make it all possible with a pre-Black Friday mega sale.
[00:06:32.847 --> 00:06:35.509]  We are launching this mega special with an unprecedented
[00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:41.272]  20% off and free shipping on all Silver Bullet across the board while supplies last.
[00:06:41.472 --> 00:06:48.397]  And to help everyone stock up for the next shortage, when you buy four bottles of Silver Bullet, you'll receive the fifth one absolutely free.
[00:06:48.577 --> 00:06:51.578]  That's on top of the 20% off savings and free shipping.
[00:06:51.678 --> 00:06:55.841]  Finally, if supplies hold, we will extend this special out to Cyber Monday.
[00:06:56.081 --> 00:06:58.745]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've never done anything like this before.
[00:06:59.026 --> 00:07:04.594]  Find this mother of all specials and others I've not yet announced yet at InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:07:04.654 --> 00:07:05.716]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:07:10.518 --> 00:07:14.421]  On the eve of Thanksgiving this year, I was thinking, what am I really thankful for?
[00:07:14.561 --> 00:07:22.726]  And I gotta tell you, it's my family, it's all the blessings of liberty that our forebearers secured, and it's you, the listeners of the broadcast, who've made everything we do possible.
[00:07:22.866 --> 00:07:30.792]  This Black Friday, I decided to bring you the biggest special we've ever offered on any of the Nutraceuticals at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:31.232 --> 00:07:35.035]  I'm talking about Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver that we've been sold out of for months.
[00:07:35.255 --> 00:07:37.176]  This time I doubled down and got even more.
[00:07:37.436 --> 00:07:40.899]  As of me taping this on the eve of Thanksgiving, we have already sold half of it.
[00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:48.163]  So instead of keeping the price at its regular discounted price, we are going to give you 20% off and free shipping on single bottles.
[00:07:48.344 --> 00:07:51.746]  But if you get four bottles, we're gonna give you the fifth one free and the free shipping.
[00:07:51.866 --> 00:07:56.469]  I don't know how long this special will run, but if supplies last, we will extend it out until Cyber Monday.
[00:07:56.569 --> 00:08:00.672]  You'll find powerful nutraceuticals like Silver Bullet and others at Infowarslife.com.
[00:08:01.372 --> 00:08:09.982]  Again, this is Alex Jones wishing you all a blessed and happy Thanksgiving and thanking you all for your support of freedom.
[00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:31.800]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:08:32.641 --> 00:08:34.081]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:08:34.301 --> 00:08:35.482]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:35.982 --> 00:08:40.483]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:43.164 --> 00:08:49.126]  It violates my belief in what America can be.
[00:08:50.147 --> 00:08:51.027]  To hear young people
[00:08:54.159 --> 00:09:00.704]  Feeling marginalized and distrustful even after they've done everything right.
[00:09:01.104 --> 00:09:01.785]  That's not who we are.
[00:09:03.326 --> 00:09:06.788]  That is President Obama in a press conference yesterday.
[00:09:06.808 --> 00:09:12.492]  I was monitoring all the major morning shows on cable and broadcast TV this morning.
[00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:17.876]  NBC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC.
[00:09:17.896 --> 00:09:22.780]  100% hyping and race baiting were the only issue in America
[00:09:24.429 --> 00:09:53.818]  is black versus white and the people versus the police no discussion of the banking complex the military industrial complex the legal law firm complex and accounting firm complex that is tax-free above the law that has publicly militarized and globalized and federalized our police and are the authors of the
[00:09:59.264 --> 00:10:04.468]  vicious police tactics and policies that have been put forward.
[00:10:05.409 --> 00:10:11.753]  They're installing the same tactics in Europe, in Australia, in the United States, in Canada.
[00:10:13.835 --> 00:10:16.456]  Someone questions the police so they choke them to death.
[00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:21.760]  In the case up in New York, where riots are promised if the cops aren't indicted.
[00:10:22.581 --> 00:10:25.123]  And in that case, I mean, they really do kill him.
[00:10:26.172 --> 00:10:26.813]  They really do.
[00:10:26.953 --> 00:10:27.373]  Grab him.
[00:10:28.174 --> 00:10:29.114]  He's not resisting him.
[00:10:29.134 --> 00:10:30.115]  He's just talking to him.
[00:10:30.655 --> 00:10:34.038]  And four white cops kill him deader than a hammer.
[00:10:34.338 --> 00:10:38.542]  We're going to talk about that case coming up.
[00:10:38.622 --> 00:10:40.543]  So there are certainly these type of cases.
[00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:41.964]  Eric Gardner.
[00:10:42.825 --> 00:10:43.766]  Choked to death.
[00:10:43.946 --> 00:10:44.426]  Executed.
[00:10:50.391 --> 00:10:51.532]  In my view, murdered.
[00:10:54.914 --> 00:10:55.835]  And then of course you have
[00:10:59.721 --> 00:11:08.172]  Thomas Kelly, a white guy, son of a cop, I should add, killed exactly the same way.
[00:11:08.212 --> 00:11:11.396]  Well, his head was beaten in over about 15 minutes and he was choked.
[00:11:11.416 --> 00:11:13.138]  They're not sure what exactly killed him.
[00:11:13.438 --> 00:11:17.243]  His neck was broken and he just begged for daddy over and over again.
[00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:18.585]  And let me tell you something right now.
[00:11:19.349 --> 00:11:21.989]  The cops don't care if you're white, you're black, you're Hispanic.
[00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:29.691]  They've been trained in their threat continuum that if something looks like a gun, shoot ya, and that if you don't follow their orders, they have a right to kill you.
[00:11:31.431 --> 00:11:38.493]  And I've heard Austin Police Chief on air just say, look, even if a police officer's order is not right and is illegal, follow it and you won't get hurt.
[00:11:41.653 --> 00:11:43.133]  And that's just the standard attitude.
[00:11:43.974 --> 00:11:45.994]  Police didn't behave like this in the past.
[00:11:47.674 --> 00:11:49.575]  When they did, there were serious repercussions.
[00:11:49.735 --> 00:11:52.957]  And so, there is a us-against-them mentality.
[00:11:52.977 --> 00:11:59.580]  There is a Marine Corps killer mentality being put into the police where they've been trained the public is the enemy, basically.
[00:12:02.381 --> 00:12:06.623]  Now, you get the federal government run by the UNESCO social engineers.
[00:12:06.663 --> 00:12:10.505]  We are under UN social engineering under a 1961 treaty.
[00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:14.127]  And it's expanded in other treaties.
[00:12:15.087 --> 00:12:16.668]  That's why it's all standardized worldwide.
[00:12:19.844 --> 00:12:24.745]  Two have a paramilitary police force that will finally suppress, dominate, and disarm the people.
[00:12:30.066 --> 00:12:36.908]  And so, to get this party started, they now want to blame it on what the general public can see.
[00:12:37.928 --> 00:12:44.930]  The helicopters, the checkpoints, the face scanning cameras, the black uniforms, the SWAT teams, the illegal checkpoints.
[00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:54.854]  They now know that we're on the verge of this, and so they're trying to play us off against each other, as I have said over and over again.
[00:12:57.256 --> 00:12:59.017]  Are there real legitimate issues?
[00:12:59.837 --> 00:13:00.438]  Absolutely.
[00:13:02.059 --> 00:13:15.807]  And in some police departments, they're bucking the global trend and trying to engage in real community policing and not kleptocratic cancer revenue generation.
[00:13:17.659 --> 00:13:46.000]  But the real drivers are the big banking institutions and others that own the big five prison companies worldwide who lobby for the police state, who lobby for the school-to-prison pipeline, complete with the gangster rap and gangster rock and all the other thug music that's meant to prime the youth and use their natural rebellion as a direct pipeline into the system.
[00:13:47.028 --> 00:13:48.309]  You want to be rebellious?
[00:13:49.089 --> 00:14:01.537]  Get a job young, wear a sports jacket, become successful, become a family man, build a community, become part of the system, and turn it off.
[00:14:03.218 --> 00:14:11.864]  And there are a lot of people working in the system that I know, governmental and corporate, who are there, quietly every day, sabotaging globalist operations.
[00:14:13.373 --> 00:14:20.018]  And that's what frustrates the globalists and why they want a centralized system where every bureaucrat, every corporate officer
[00:14:21.306 --> 00:14:41.499]  right down to the local level must follow a worldwide standardized corporate private zoning program down to your speech and down to whether you can have a fireplace or what type of light bulbs or toilet you can have to how many children you can have and it's called UN Agenda 21 of the Treaty of 1992.
[00:14:46.505 --> 00:14:58.768]  That Congress did not ratify, but that has been implemented by George Herbert Walker, William Jefferson Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:15:03.329 --> 00:15:04.610]  You want to know who the enemy is?
[00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:13.672]  It's these global treaties we didn't ratify that Obama is now putting us under, and Congress isn't even allowed to read the new Trans-Pacific Partnership Treaty.
[00:15:14.625 --> 00:15:20.721]  Wikileaks leaked one section of it, and it was total regulation and censorship of the web.
[00:15:21.082 --> 00:15:23.268]  And let me tell you, Wikileaks is a front for Google.
[00:15:24.915 --> 00:15:40.985]  And others who don't want governments to take over the web because Google has been artificially intelligent for a long time and is now taking over the physical plane right now, putting their hubs in and taking over every major company out there, just so you know.
[00:15:41.285 --> 00:15:46.889]  So there's a fight inside the AI system and I'm here to give you a newsflash, government already lost.
[00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:53.033]  That's the only reason Google released one of the 30 parts of that partnership
[00:15:55.939 --> 00:16:04.242]  I've talked to folks that have been at these events as aides, and it is a total global governance official takeover happening right now, but that's a whole other subject.
[00:16:05.942 --> 00:16:08.463]  So how do you divert people while all this is happening?
[00:16:08.483 --> 00:16:21.608]  While the standard of living goes down for the average person, while deindustrialization takes place, while everything is done to ensure we can't have meaningful jobs and a future with the media teaching school kids they're worthless and that humans are a cancer.
[00:16:22.834 --> 00:16:27.636]  With the medical tyranny, the laced, poison-in-a-needle vaccines.
[00:16:28.896 --> 00:16:32.238]  What do you do while all this dismantling is taking place?
[00:16:33.258 --> 00:16:37.700]  This siege, where only the globalists are allowed to operate and consolidate power.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.722]  Well, how would the British control India, outnumbered about 10,000 to 1?
[00:16:45.034 --> 00:16:59.191]  How would other empires, the Romans, outnumbered 20-30-1 in Germany, and in Britannia, and other areas, and Gaul, and Africa, North Africa.
[00:16:59.731 --> 00:17:00.512]  How would they do it?
[00:17:00.973 --> 00:17:03.636]  They would play the different tribes off against each other.
[00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:05.969]  And I've talked a lot about it.
[00:17:06.009 --> 00:17:07.710]  I recently reordered it because I couldn't find it.
[00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:15.292]  A collection of essays written to the Roman Senate by Julius Caesar, first king of the new Rome.
[00:17:15.852 --> 00:17:24.134]  They had kings before, and they had their rise to power when they outlawed kings, and then the kings came back and replaced the patrician class.
[00:17:24.174 --> 00:17:28.955]  But I went back and read that book again a few weeks ago, written by Julius Caesar.
[00:17:30.452 --> 00:17:32.793]  Pretty interesting, you know, to read what Julius Caesar actually wrote.
[00:17:33.073 --> 00:17:34.333]  To read what Adolf Hitler wrote.
[00:17:34.513 --> 00:17:35.914]  I've read Adolf Hitler's two books.
[00:17:36.554 --> 00:17:37.754]  He didn't just write Mein Kampf.
[00:17:37.774 --> 00:17:38.374]  He wrote one other.
[00:17:38.414 --> 00:17:38.995]  I forget the name.
[00:17:40.275 --> 00:17:42.676]  When you buy those things at the bookstore, they think you love Hitler.
[00:17:42.936 --> 00:17:44.176]  That's how dumb the public is.
[00:17:44.216 --> 00:17:45.397]  No, I want to know what he said.
[00:17:45.417 --> 00:17:50.558]  I feel like reading a book written by Jeffrey Dahmer doesn't mean I want to put people in the refrigerator.
[00:17:51.439 --> 00:17:53.079]  I want to understand people like that.
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:58.521]  That's why I've read Das Kapital and the Communist Manifesto.
[00:17:59.346 --> 00:18:01.068]  Because I want to understand the enemy.
[00:18:05.072 --> 00:18:07.534]  But this is all a takeover plan.
[00:18:08.996 --> 00:18:11.418]  And there's no doubt now they're trying to cause a race war.
[00:18:11.959 --> 00:18:13.981]  No doubt they're trying to make this the issue.
[00:18:15.102 --> 00:18:18.786]  That white people and that police
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.161]  Are the reason the dollars devalued?
[00:18:23.421 --> 00:18:24.982]  Are the reason there's crime on the streets?
[00:18:25.682 --> 00:18:28.464]  Are the reason that there's any problems?
[00:18:28.544 --> 00:18:32.326]  And my issue is there is injustice.
[00:18:32.406 --> 00:18:34.027]  A lot of police departments are above the law.
[00:18:34.087 --> 00:18:34.667]  That's wrong.
[00:18:35.467 --> 00:18:42.011]  But the globalists are triggering the injustice they helped build and are now pointing
[00:18:43.157 --> 00:18:49.459]  The people, in a racially based way, at whites and police, in an attempt to destabilize the nation.
[00:18:49.799 --> 00:18:50.599]  And it is a crime.
[00:18:51.579 --> 00:18:55.901]  We've got Brown's stepfather, they're talking about indicting him for saying, burn down the city.
[00:18:56.921 --> 00:18:58.901]  Well, I mean, it's pretty clear what he said.
[00:18:58.921 --> 00:19:04.803]  And if he doesn't get indicted, well then, next time, somebody else, I guess, can say burn the city down.
[00:19:06.957 --> 00:19:10.681]  Ferguson Police Chief, a lot of discussion about charging Brown's stepfather with inciting riot.
[00:19:11.122 --> 00:19:14.426]  Violent agitators will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
[00:19:15.968 --> 00:19:17.930]  Well, you pretty much have to do that.
[00:19:19.011 --> 00:19:20.934]  Or a real civil war is going to start.
[00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:26.040]  And let me just give Louis Farrakhan and everybody else a little message here.
[00:19:27.498 --> 00:19:32.600]  It will not go good for the grassroots, whether you're black, white, or Hispanic, or Asian.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.900]  And I don't think Farrakhan's stupid.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.562]  And Farrakhan must know that the powers that be want this.
[00:19:38.982 --> 00:19:41.763]  So I ask Louis Farrakhan, why are you doing this?
[00:19:42.003 --> 00:19:45.264]  There's new clips of Farrakhan talking about killing people.
[00:19:50.605 --> 00:19:55.727]  Meanwhile, whether you're black or white, the entire Detroit public lighting system is down.
[00:19:59.198 --> 00:20:01.443]  Yep, that's being reported by the Detroit newspaper.
[00:20:03.067 --> 00:20:04.951]  The entire lighting system is down.
[00:20:05.092 --> 00:20:06.535]  That's the plan.
[00:20:07.156 --> 00:20:08.580]  Lights out in the Republic.
[00:20:10.805 --> 00:20:11.546]  Hey, Boomer!
[00:20:11.806 --> 00:20:15.127]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[00:20:15.247 --> 00:20:16.807]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[00:20:16.908 --> 00:20:18.668]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[00:20:18.868 --> 00:20:24.350]  Mom says it's because the Berkey Filtration System cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:25.451]  I know, right?
[00:20:25.531 --> 00:20:26.471]  You love it, too!
[00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:28.152]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.

[00:21:09.304 --> 00:21:17.610]  What disaster is so powerful it unleashes a chain of mass pandemics, economic meltdowns, and violent food riots all at the same time?
[00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:20.591]  NASA has already set the countdown timer.
[00:21:20.711 --> 00:21:25.132]  And right now, the 21st century apocalypse is less than 13 months away.
[00:21:25.472 --> 00:21:29.273]  Former CIA Director James Woolsey says two-thirds of the U.S.
[00:21:29.313 --> 00:21:31.954]  population could perish in a matter of seconds.
[00:21:32.334 --> 00:21:34.334]  The world as we know it will cease to exist.
[00:21:34.674 --> 00:21:36.455]  The world's economy will be wiped out.
[00:21:36.655 --> 00:21:37.935]  Mass riots will follow.
[00:21:38.075 --> 00:21:38.936]  We're good to go.
[00:22:08.075 --> 00:22:08.535]  No.

[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:37.545]  So, black churches on fire, grocery stores in many markets robbed, people stealing the lottery tickets.
[00:24:38.725 --> 00:24:42.848]  This is legitimate because white people are inherently bad.
[00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:48.952]  It doesn't matter that only a very small percentage of white people in this country's ancestors had slaves.
[00:24:49.473 --> 00:24:51.774]  It doesn't matter if the guy getting clubbed to death in St.
[00:24:51.834 --> 00:24:58.178]  Louis, didn't even speak English hardly, and was from Bosnia with no connection to black slavery.
[00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:00.180]  It's all legitimate.
[00:25:00.998 --> 00:25:02.419]  Time Magazine headline.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.463]  When it's time to riot, in defense of rioting.
[00:25:07.443 --> 00:25:08.805]  CNN, same thing.
[00:25:10.546 --> 00:25:14.169]  MSNBC, this is because America was founded on racism.
[00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:27.400]  Well, yeah, if you went to Africa at the time, blacks were selling blacks, and Arabs were selling blacks, and whites were still getting sold all over the world, and serfdom wasn't abolished in areas of Germania until the 1880s.
[00:25:31.141 --> 00:25:45.013]  So again, imagine a thousand years from now, all we'll hear about if we were to survive as a culture, is how white people, a minority on the planet, about 7% of the population, are the essence of evil.
[00:25:48.256 --> 00:25:49.637]  But notice who's saying that.
[00:25:50.078 --> 00:25:53.741]  Time Magazine, CNN, MSNBC, the White House.
[00:25:54.822 --> 00:25:56.964]  Exacerbating, race-baiting.
[00:25:58.345 --> 00:26:05.768]  Trying to get the police attacked, which will then legitimize the militarization and the paramilitary tactics that are absolutely horrible.
[00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:11.251]  Works perfectly, doesn't it?
[00:26:11.351 --> 00:26:17.553]  Congressional Black Caucus takes to the floor and puts their hands up saying, don't shoot.
[00:26:20.134 --> 00:26:25.977]  I wonder if the black congressman, that they're doing that, I wonder how many times they've been attacked by white people, physically.
[00:26:28.192 --> 00:26:30.713]  I mean, imagine if I walked around with my hands up when I saw black people.
[00:26:30.953 --> 00:26:34.554]  Oh my gosh, I've probably been attacked by black people 15, 20 times growing up in Dallas.
[00:26:34.854 --> 00:26:35.874]  I've been put in the hospital.
[00:26:36.254 --> 00:26:38.054]  Oh, you're black!
[00:26:38.314 --> 00:26:38.935]  It's your fault!
[00:26:39.115 --> 00:26:39.515]  You did it!
[00:26:39.695 --> 00:26:40.795]  A black guy attacked me!
[00:26:41.375 --> 00:26:44.216]  You'd be like, you crazy person!
[00:26:44.396 --> 00:26:45.436]  I'm not the one that did that!
[00:26:48.397 --> 00:26:55.178]  And the video I saw in New York of mainly white demonstrators, white liberals, all walking by, looking at the police like, how dare you!
[00:26:55.659 --> 00:26:57.179]  You pieces of filth!
[00:26:57.864 --> 00:27:02.887]  Just, oh my gosh, Mr. Brown, like they did it.
[00:27:05.429 --> 00:27:07.230]  I am not going to take this fake guilt.
[00:27:08.691 --> 00:27:11.232]  Where I'm not for Obamacare, so you call me racist?
[00:27:11.352 --> 00:27:12.853]  Oh my gosh, I'm so scared.
[00:27:14.214 --> 00:27:14.814]  Oh, don't worry.
[00:27:15.735 --> 00:27:24.180]  Planned Parenthood, the literal, and I will use the word literally, because it literally is the Hitler eugenics arm in America.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.541]  It started Hitler.
[00:27:26.141 --> 00:27:26.581]  On record.
[00:27:27.082 --> 00:27:27.462]  Funding.
[00:27:28.897 --> 00:27:32.719]  Rockefeller Foundation called Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany.
[00:27:33.299 --> 00:27:34.739]  Funded it, set it up, everything.
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:42.302]  They are calling for marches and trying to, oh, because they love black people.
[00:27:42.763 --> 00:27:44.983]  Why doesn't Louis Farrakhan come out against Planned Parenthood?
[00:27:45.244 --> 00:27:46.184]  If he has, I haven't heard it.
[00:27:46.584 --> 00:27:48.765]  Why doesn't he come out against, I mean, give me a break.
[00:27:50.575 --> 00:27:52.756]  This is all completely staged.
[00:27:53.377 --> 00:27:54.857]  The article's on Infowars.com.
[00:27:55.198 --> 00:28:02.161]  Without a hint of irony, Planned Parenthood joins hashtag black lives matter protest.
[00:28:03.322 --> 00:28:06.644]  Yeah, the 52% of blacks that aren't born because of abortion, I think they do matter.
[00:28:08.705 --> 00:28:12.207]  But remember, that's from a blonde-haired, blue-eyed, white devil.
[00:28:12.227 --> 00:28:19.151]  Of course, Martin Luther King said, it's not the color of the skin, it's the content of your deeds, what you stand for, and I agree with that.
[00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:24.673]  In fact, they used it to legitimize the transatlantic slave trade 500 years ago.
[00:28:25.313 --> 00:28:29.637]  When they started outlawing slavery in some areas of Europe, like Italy, white slaves were being outlawed.
[00:28:30.257 --> 00:28:30.998]  They said, what are we going to do?
[00:28:31.018 --> 00:28:33.039]  Well, the Arabs are running black slaves all over the place.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:34.220]  Well, what do we say?
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:38.584]  Well, we'll say that they're basically the sons of Ham and have a mark of Cain.
[00:28:38.604 --> 00:28:39.525]  And that's why they're black.
[00:28:39.865 --> 00:28:41.506]  And so they're evil and they're devils.
[00:28:42.107 --> 00:28:43.428]  And so they deserve to be slaves.
[00:28:44.731 --> 00:28:49.295]  Oh, and now whites are inherently evil because we're the devil and have the mark of Cain.
[00:28:49.535 --> 00:28:51.477]  That's what the black liberation groups teach.
[00:28:52.098 --> 00:28:54.580]  I mean, can't people come up with anything new?
[00:28:56.702 --> 00:28:58.923]  But it's always an excuse to abuse somebody.
[00:29:00.305 --> 00:29:05.970]  In Africa, the UN will go in and get one black tribe to kill the other black tribe because they worship a different animal.
[00:29:06.803 --> 00:29:14.343]  They'll get one animus group to kill another animus group because one group follows the lion and the other group, you know, follows the monitor lizard of the tortoise.
[00:29:16.257 --> 00:29:18.839]  This is the type of idiocy that we're dealing with here.
[00:29:19.259 --> 00:29:22.682]  Instead of tribally being based on the ideas of freedom.
[00:29:22.982 --> 00:29:24.983]  But let's go out to break with President Obama.
[00:29:25.664 --> 00:29:27.465]  We're gonna come back from break with President Obama.
[00:29:27.785 --> 00:29:40.154]  He says, youth that have tried to do everything right, that's right, burn buildings down, shoot at firefighters, shoot cops, hammer people to death, everything, they're doing everything right.
[00:29:40.594 --> 00:29:45.258]  And then, all this does is smokescreen a case we're gonna cover when we come back.
[00:29:48.171 --> 00:29:54.834]  Staten Island police killed Eric Gardner with chokehold and the word is if the police don't get in trouble there's going to be riots.
[00:29:56.515 --> 00:29:58.296]  This is a lot more legitimate case than Brown.
[00:29:59.297 --> 00:30:02.298]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.219 --> 00:30:05.900]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.564 --> 00:30:12.205]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[00:30:12.525 --> 00:30:16.307]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[00:30:17.067 --> 00:30:21.430]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:28.313]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[00:30:28.833 --> 00:30:37.898]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:30:38.118 --> 00:30:43.521]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[00:30:43.681 --> 00:30:50.925]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.
[00:30:51.266 --> 00:30:53.547]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:30:53.827 --> 00:30:58.970]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the InfoWarp.

[00:31:10.416 --> 00:31:14.298]  On the eve of Thanksgiving this year, I was thinking, what am I really thankful for?
[00:31:14.459 --> 00:31:22.604]  And I gotta tell you, it's my family, it's all the blessings of liberty that our forebearers secured, and it's you, the listeners of the broadcast, who've made everything we do possible.
[00:31:22.764 --> 00:31:30.689]  This Black Friday, I decided to bring you the biggest special we've ever offered on any of the Nutraceuticals at Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:31.129 --> 00:31:34.931]  I'm talking about silver bullet colloidal silver that we've been sold out of for months.
[00:31:35.171 --> 00:31:37.073]  This time I doubled down and got even more.
[00:31:37.333 --> 00:31:40.795]  As of me taping this on the eve of Thanksgiving, we have already sold half of it.
[00:31:40.915 --> 00:31:48.079]  So instead of keeping the price at its regular discounted price, we are going to give you 20% off and free shipping on single bottles.
[00:31:48.239 --> 00:31:51.641]  But if you get four bottles, we're gonna give you the fifth one free and the free shipping.
[00:31:51.761 --> 00:31:53.262]  I don't know how long this special will run, but if
[00:31:53.342 --> 00:31:54.163]  Supplies last.
[00:31:54.183 --> 00:31:56.365]  We will extend it out until Cyber Monday.
[00:31:56.465 --> 00:32:02.252]  You'll find powerful nutraceuticals like Silver Bullet and others at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:32:02.272 --> 00:32:09.880]  Again, this is Alex Jones wishing you all a blessed and happy Thanksgiving and thanking you all for your support of freedom.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.461]  Another major health threat.
[00:32:11.501 --> 00:32:16.403]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:32:16.483 --> 00:32:19.124]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:32:19.164 --> 00:32:25.928]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:32:26.188 --> 00:32:29.049]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:32:29.189 --> 00:32:32.131]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:32:32.211 --> 00:32:34.132]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:32:34.152 --> 00:32:36.973]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:32:37.073 --> 00:32:42.575]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:32:42.815 --> 00:32:46.296]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:32:46.316 --> 00:32:49.297]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:32:49.397 --> 00:32:56.500]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.781]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[00:33:19.859 --> 00:33:24.163]  I am a shotgun rider for the San Jacinto Line.
[00:33:24.424 --> 00:33:28.508]  The desert is my brother, my skin is cracked and dry.
[00:33:29.108 --> 00:33:36.375]  I was riding on a cold coast and everything was fine, till we took a shorter road to save some time.
[00:33:38.795 --> 00:33:42.480]  Bandits only fired once, they shot me in the chest.
[00:33:43.802 --> 00:33:48.389]  They may have wounded me, but they'll never get the best of better men.
[00:33:48.509 --> 00:33:51.854]  I'll ride again.
[00:33:51.914 --> 00:33:53.075]  Yes, I'll ride again.
[00:33:54.162 --> 00:33:58.904]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:34:16.192 --> 00:34:21.633]  Buck to Sandbar.
[00:34:23.454 --> 00:34:27.514]  That's the highwayman bringing us in.
[00:34:28.134 --> 00:34:33.616]  You know, the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry, it was once said.
[00:34:36.996 --> 00:34:40.897]  And Providence does bend.
[00:34:41.986 --> 00:34:45.210]  As Martin Luther King said, towards those that want justice and freedom.
[00:34:48.153 --> 00:34:51.997]  This exact quote was, justice, the universe bends towards justice.
[00:34:53.678 --> 00:34:55.160]  And I've certainly found that in my life.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:56.722]  There's a lot of injustice in this country.
[00:34:58.783 --> 00:35:01.365]  A lot of bad things happening in this nation, obviously.
[00:35:02.406 --> 00:35:09.793]  And I would say, clearly, on average, in many cities and areas, black people are singled out.
[00:35:10.173 --> 00:35:11.494]  They are pulled over more.
[00:35:12.075 --> 00:35:13.096]  The statistics show it.
[00:35:13.136 --> 00:35:14.077]  They do get harassed.
[00:35:14.717 --> 00:35:16.139]  Even by black cops.
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:24.786]  Because there is the stereotype, promulgated by MTV and the social engineers, of the thug culture.
[00:35:25.683 --> 00:35:41.981]  But unfortunately, there are a lot of good, hard-working, smart, good people who get brushed with a broad brush because of the thug culture that has grown in the black community and is growing everywhere else as well.
[00:35:42.001 --> 00:35:47.627]  I mean, as a white guy, if I dressed like a thug, I'd be treated like one.
[00:35:50.239 --> 00:35:51.681]  I saw that growing up in high school.
[00:35:52.723 --> 00:35:55.647]  I liked dressing preppy, not because I wanted to be cool and be a prep.
[00:35:56.208 --> 00:36:00.053]  I just liked how slacks or blue jeans and a polo shirt felt.
[00:36:00.634 --> 00:36:01.635]  It was easy, it was quick.
[00:36:02.754 --> 00:36:06.937]  And, uh, you know, the trendies putting on all these elaborate outfits and things, great!
[00:36:07.317 --> 00:36:08.598]  I just don't have time to mess with it.
[00:36:08.978 --> 00:36:23.307]  I still comb my hair straight back in the morning, and about 45 minutes later it dries out, and sometimes when I take a shower after working out and I come into the office, it's sticking straight up, because I comb it straight back and everybody always laughs when I walk by, and I go in the bathroom and barely comb my hair and I'm done.
[00:36:23.327 --> 00:36:30.532]  So I wouldn't say I'm a prep because I want to be a prep, it's just that's the style that I liked.
[00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:33.472]  Got a lot better treatment because of that.
[00:36:47.814 --> 00:36:54.997]  It's how you act and it's what you stand for long term that governs in this country whether you're going to be successful or not.
[00:36:55.357 --> 00:36:57.717]  Now more and more you've got to be a globalist insider.
[00:36:58.138 --> 00:37:02.059]  They're trying to get rid of the free market that allows anybody to become successful.
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:05.560]  Anybody to excel.
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.261]  And you could still do that in this country.
[00:37:08.701 --> 00:37:11.962]  We're still in the top 10 nations to be able to start a business and survive.
[00:37:12.182 --> 00:37:13.803]  We were number one a few decades ago.
[00:37:15.404 --> 00:37:16.364]  But in some metrics
[00:37:18.573 --> 00:37:21.999]  We're behind every industrialized nation when it comes to freedom.
[00:37:24.162 --> 00:37:32.496]  We still have a lot of economic freedom, but when it comes to police state being spied on, surveillance, due process being run over, yes, we're in trouble!
[00:37:34.096 --> 00:37:38.018]  And the foreign banks, the multinationals, the globalists are the authors.
[00:37:38.078 --> 00:37:42.541]  They are running the show, the funding, the grants, the training.
[00:37:43.341 --> 00:37:48.084]  And I told you this Ferguson situation looked like it was staged before it happened.
[00:37:48.144 --> 00:37:57.729]  Two weeks before I said, get ready for the media to try to stir up inner-city black communities as a diversion after the election.
[00:37:58.916 --> 00:38:06.178]  And then I said the last few weeks, look for the UN to come out with their UN treaty and call for disarming the American people.
[00:38:06.478 --> 00:38:07.159]  Wait for it.
[00:38:07.619 --> 00:38:08.319]  Wait for it.
[00:38:09.159 --> 00:38:10.160]  And the police.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.461]  State Department Memorandum 7277.
[00:38:21.723 --> 00:38:27.345]  UN attacks US gun rights and more, citing Ferguson and cops.
[00:38:28.877 --> 00:38:39.610]  How many times the last two, three weeks when that treaty got announced that they're going to go ahead with it December 24th as a Christmas present and Obama says he'll implement it as his authority without Congress.
[00:38:43.395 --> 00:38:46.219]  Think about the magnitude of that.
[00:38:47.549 --> 00:38:52.612]  Freedom from War, the United States program for general and complete disarmament in a peaceful world, U.S.
[00:38:52.652 --> 00:38:56.394]  State Department memorandum to line up with the U.N.
[00:38:56.594 --> 00:39:04.539]  UNESCO treaty, and it lists the treaty numbers.
[00:39:04.559 --> 00:39:05.420]  1961, September.
[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:08.421]  Office of Public Service, Bureau of Public Affairs.
[00:39:09.202 --> 00:39:12.204]  That's an unofficial treaty we operate under.
[00:39:13.164 --> 00:39:15.606]  And when they're done with the Civil War in America,
[00:39:16.601 --> 00:39:17.741]  That they planned even then.
[00:39:17.761 --> 00:39:36.228]  I was first told about 7277, even though it was public, by General Benton K. Parton, four-star general when he retired, head of the Air Force at one point, but before that head of Air Force Weapons Development.
[00:39:39.892 --> 00:39:43.374]  Parton, of course, exposed, went to Oklahoma the day after and showed how they'd blown the building up.
[00:39:43.875 --> 00:39:44.735]  He could see it on TV.
[00:39:45.276 --> 00:39:46.497]  The blast points on the columns.
[00:39:47.077 --> 00:39:49.539]  We even had the witnesses inside seeing the feds plant the bombs.
[00:39:49.659 --> 00:39:50.499]  We know their names!
[00:39:52.701 --> 00:39:54.902]  Parton knew Clinton blew that thing.
[00:39:57.804 --> 00:40:01.887]  And Parton talked about the briefings they got, high level in the 70s and 80s.
[00:40:03.188 --> 00:40:04.589]  Secret briefings, basically.
[00:40:06.286 --> 00:40:13.108]  Inside the military, internal groups that were aware of this, and were trying to stop it.
[00:40:13.128 --> 00:40:24.673]  And 7277 and others are public documents where it shows, first they disarmed the American people, then they disarmed the police, then they disarmed the military, and it is directly out of the Hunger Games.
[00:40:26.213 --> 00:40:28.174]  So when I talk about this, it's not from Hunger Games.
[00:40:29.218 --> 00:40:43.730]  Hunger Games is imitating this, where you have these regions, these sectors, and you've got these floating platforms with peacekeepers, and everybody else is kept without electricity on the ground at starvation level.
[00:40:48.233 --> 00:40:50.175]  What's this right here, out of the Detroit Free Press?
[00:40:50.195 --> 00:40:52.477]  DetroitNews.com.
[00:40:55.019 --> 00:40:57.601]  Entire Detroit public lighting system is down.
[00:40:59.747 --> 00:41:15.671]  A widespread power outage Tuesday has caused evacuations of buildings throughout the downtown, including Joe Lewis Arena, Colman A. Young Municipal Center, and Frank Murphy Hall of Justice, the Detroit Institute of Arts, and some buildings in Wayne State University.
[00:41:16.732 --> 00:41:22.673]  DTE Energy Co., Scott Simons, said it looks like the entire Detroit public lighting system is down.
[00:41:23.133 --> 00:41:28.375]  They already announced three months ago they turned off the street lights at night, affecting about 100 buildings, and it just goes on.
[00:41:31.084 --> 00:41:32.005]  Still out as we talk.
[00:41:35.748 --> 00:41:37.650]  This is Democratic Party politics.
[00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:38.791]  This is socialism.
[00:41:38.871 --> 00:41:40.052]  This is corruption.
[00:41:40.373 --> 00:41:41.394]  This is where it leads.
[00:41:41.454 --> 00:41:42.334]  This is where it goes.
[00:41:42.735 --> 00:41:45.998]  This is where Al Gore laughing at Ross Perot.
[00:41:46.018 --> 00:41:47.139]  Remember in 1994?
[00:41:47.739 --> 00:41:48.860]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
[00:41:49.321 --> 00:41:50.662]  Ross Perot, you're so stupid.
[00:41:51.943 --> 00:41:53.625]  NAFTA and GATT will raise our wages.
[00:41:56.462 --> 00:42:01.644]  So they de-industrialize you and then say, oh, let's up the wages after they devalue the dollar.
[00:42:04.584 --> 00:42:07.905]  They cut your arms off, cut your legs off, and then give you a wheelchair.
[00:42:10.706 --> 00:42:15.568]  But that's only to break our back and break our will.
[00:42:16.988 --> 00:42:20.209]  That's only to bring this system in.
[00:42:25.885 --> 00:42:27.745]  When they're done, the real fun starts.
[00:42:28.585 --> 00:42:30.306]  So here it is from the United Nations.
[00:42:31.786 --> 00:42:54.870]  But first, let's play that clip of Obama saying, when you do everything you're supposed to, which is shooting police and firefighters that have done nothing, burning down buildings, when you've done everything you're supposed to, beating people in the head with hammers till they die, and attacking reporters and getting in people's faces, when you've done everything you're supposed to, and then you don't get justice,
[00:42:56.607 --> 00:42:58.808]  What, like the grand jury was supposed to ignore the witnesses?
[00:43:00.068 --> 00:43:00.528]  And who knows?
[00:43:00.548 --> 00:43:02.629]  It could be wrong, could be a lie.
[00:43:02.949 --> 00:43:07.830]  The point is the government's manipulating this to get us all fighting with each other.
[00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:09.090]  That's the elephant in the room.
[00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:10.031]  Here's Obama.
[00:43:10.651 --> 00:43:16.552]  It violates my belief in what America can be.
[00:43:17.573 --> 00:43:18.453]  To hear young people
[00:43:21.565 --> 00:43:28.128]  Feeling marginalized and distrustful even after they've done everything right.
[00:43:28.528 --> 00:43:29.209]  That's not who we are.
[00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:36.672]  And I don't think that's who the overwhelming majority of Americans want us to be.
[00:43:38.522 --> 00:43:48.970]  And I think there may be a convergence here where we've got outstanding law enforcement officials who recognize that times have changed and want to be responsive.
[00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:52.733]  I know that Richard Berry... Let's just stop right there.
[00:43:52.773 --> 00:44:05.403]  Times have changed, implying that this police officer shot Brown because, you know, he's old-fashioned racist or whatever.
[00:44:08.379 --> 00:44:09.700]  It just goes on and on.
[00:44:12.102 --> 00:44:14.604]  Now, continuing, I want to go to this next clip.
[00:44:14.644 --> 00:44:18.407]  This is Dick Cheney, before I get back into the UN information and give you details of that.
[00:44:18.968 --> 00:44:21.249]  Dick Cheney says ISIS will nuke the US.
[00:44:21.309 --> 00:44:25.113]  Remember Lindsey Graham last year when we discovered the missing nukes at Daesh?
[00:44:25.433 --> 00:44:26.374]  And they would not deny it.
[00:44:26.974 --> 00:44:33.739]  And within hours of us reporting it, it was on CBS News, Senator Graham saying, yes, nukes will go off on the East Coast.
[00:44:34.804 --> 00:44:44.007]  From Islamic State, he said, from the radicals in Syria, if we don't overthrow Assad, acting like he was the radicals, when it's the opposite group.
[00:44:45.487 --> 00:44:54.509]  And I noticed the Council on Foreign Relations making preparations and others for tactical nukes to go off in Dallas, Chicago, Cleveland, and Denver.
[00:44:55.089 --> 00:44:58.911]  Because they always love to tell us what they're going to do before they do it, and so back in 2003, and then again recently,
[00:45:01.684 --> 00:45:07.779]  The head of the Hart-Rudman Commission, it's a key Council on Foreign Relations super body, I mean it makes the decisions.
[00:45:09.858 --> 00:45:13.101]  The Rubin Commission decided to adopt the Rand Corporation plan for the police state.
[00:45:13.141 --> 00:45:14.121]  I mean, that's how powerful they are.
[00:45:14.281 --> 00:45:15.162]  You can watch them discuss it.
[00:45:15.202 --> 00:45:16.883]  You can go to C-SPAN archives and watch it.
[00:45:16.903 --> 00:45:22.908]  There's probably been 20 meetings I know of of the Hart-Rubin Commission on television with the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:45:22.928 --> 00:45:23.989]  That's how I know all this stuff.
[00:45:24.489 --> 00:45:26.811]  And they just said, yeah, we're looking for Dallas and Cleveland to get hit.
[00:45:26.831 --> 00:45:27.452]  They will be hit.
[00:45:28.032 --> 00:45:29.113]  That'll be the end of your way of life.
[00:45:30.074 --> 00:45:31.074]  That'll bring in the New World Order.
[00:45:31.435 --> 00:45:32.976]  I mean, these are bizarre quotes.
[00:45:32.996 --> 00:45:33.937]  You want me to pull them up for you?
[00:45:34.895 --> 00:45:41.802]  They think you're so stupid, Gary Hart writes public letters in the Huffington Post about how the government stages terror attacks and how great it is.
[00:45:45.466 --> 00:45:51.652]  So, let's go ahead and play Dick Cheney saying ISIS will nuke the US.
[00:45:52.776 --> 00:46:00.942]  We've now got the terrorist Taliban organization in Pakistan conducting a big raid on Karachi Airport.
[00:46:01.183 --> 00:46:02.444]  Why do we care about Pakistan?
[00:46:02.464 --> 00:46:04.185]  We only have 50 to 100 nukes.
[00:46:04.906 --> 00:46:13.172]  And if you combine the terrorists with the ability to get their hands on a weapon of some kind, then obviously we're going to see a very serious situation.
[00:46:13.232 --> 00:46:15.914]  It almost seems like... and maybe I'm reading into what you're saying.
[00:46:16.795 --> 00:46:27.404]  That if we don't get real about the rise and the march of radical Islam right now, that literally we face the potential of a human catastrophe on a scale that we've not seen before.
[00:46:27.425 --> 00:46:28.525]  Am I reading into that?
[00:46:28.566 --> 00:46:29.787]  I think that's an accurate statement.
[00:46:30.047 --> 00:46:36.392]  I think that threat will increase dramatically and as well we already know for example from A.Q.
[00:46:36.593 --> 00:46:37.814]  Khan, the man who put together
[00:46:38.314 --> 00:46:39.015]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:47:00.559 --> 00:47:04.542]  To that kind of technology, obviously, becomes increasingly problematic.
[00:47:05.023 --> 00:47:09.106]  On top of that, we've got Iran trying to build a nuclear program.
[00:47:09.146 --> 00:47:10.627]  Yeah, I see the world the way you do.
[00:47:10.928 --> 00:47:13.310]  I view this as a real, clear, and present danger.
[00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:19.635]  Almost the potential for a modern-day holocaust that we've not seen, maybe in your grandkids' lives or my kids' lives.
[00:47:20.656 --> 00:47:21.597]  Pretty scary stuff.
[00:47:21.937 --> 00:47:22.598]  It is scary stuff.
[00:47:22.618 --> 00:47:22.958]  It is scary.
[00:47:24.019 --> 00:47:32.183]  Of course, he doesn't tell you that on record, the Bill Clinton administration transferred all of those weapons systems to AQ Khan Laboratories.
[00:47:32.823 --> 00:47:34.504]  To AQ Khan and his laboratories.
[00:47:36.505 --> 00:47:38.166]  I mean, that's on record.
[00:47:38.206 --> 00:47:38.666]  Look it up.
[00:47:39.187 --> 00:47:41.488]  That's all over the news, 15 years ago.
[00:47:42.908 --> 00:47:45.410]  Of course, they don't tell you
[00:47:47.122 --> 00:47:57.711]  That our government funded the 200,000 plus Al-Qaeda fighters to run around in a four-year jihad killing everybody that wasn't a radical bloodsucker inside Syria.
[00:48:00.593 --> 00:48:03.735]  They count on us being ignorant and I am so sick of it.
[00:48:03.956 --> 00:48:13.583]  Now I've told you for three weeks straight since they announced the treaty that Ferguson and they were going to stage riots and that they would then call for UN control and State Department memorandum 7277 under UN UNESCO law.
[00:48:17.196 --> 00:48:21.118]  And now the story from the New American Magazine is up on Infowars.com.
[00:48:23.619 --> 00:48:24.879]  Again, is there police brutality?
[00:48:24.939 --> 00:48:26.700]  Are there racist cops out there on all sides?
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:27.000]  Yes.
[00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:28.521]  Is there stuff going on that's wrong?
[00:48:28.561 --> 00:48:28.761]  Yes.
[00:48:28.781 --> 00:48:30.202]  I'm going to cover a case of that next segment.
[00:48:32.183 --> 00:48:33.683]  But is this being played?
[00:48:33.863 --> 00:48:34.904]  Is this a scam?
[00:48:35.084 --> 00:48:37.365]  Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[00:48:40.066 --> 00:48:40.306]  U.N.
[00:48:40.346 --> 00:48:41.607]  attacks, U.S.
[00:48:41.727 --> 00:48:46.329]  gun rights and more, citing Ferguson and cops, and then it quotes Ban Ki-moon,
[00:48:47.352 --> 00:48:50.335]  I mean, if you talk back to the cops in South Korea, folks, they literally break your neck.
[00:48:52.417 --> 00:49:04.708]  Pointing to the killing of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson, along with subsequent unrest in Ferguson and policing issues, the dictator-dominated United Nations has launched another brazen assault on America and U.S.
[00:49:04.748 --> 00:49:07.010]  sovereignty and the gun rights of Americans.
[00:49:08.071 --> 00:49:08.311]  U.N.
[00:49:08.351 --> 00:49:13.036]  boss Ban Ki-moon, who's in South Korea, the Global Bodies Human Rights Council,
[00:49:14.369 --> 00:49:21.955]  And even the UN Committee Against Torture all took turns lambasting the United States as an alleged stronghold of systematic racism and police brutality.
[00:49:22.779 --> 00:49:37.029]  To fix the problems, the UN argued, Americans need, their elected officials must submit to the demands of self-styled global authorities, close quote, including some unconstitutional gun control to further restrict access to firearms, the UN goes on.
[00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:39.851]  And you read the article, they want the police restricted too.
[00:49:40.172 --> 00:49:44.134]  See, hey, we don't want the UN controlling our police.
[00:49:44.575 --> 00:49:47.537]  Our police are already under UN, that's why they act like this.
[00:49:49.678 --> 00:49:51.620]  Look at the muralization, cross-training.
[00:49:53.171 --> 00:49:56.734]  Okay, I forget to tell people about this, and it's such a big deal, it's crazy.
[00:49:57.334 --> 00:50:04.661]  We are running the biggest special ever on PrisonPlanet.tv to see the nightly news, all my films, special live events.

[00:50:20.096 --> 00:50:23.158]  We're running it through this week and this week only.

[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:52.462]  Looks like me police murder.
[00:50:59.190 --> 00:51:00.871]  I don't think it's premeditated, but it is murder.
[00:51:01.371 --> 00:51:09.793]  Up in New York, four white cops choking a black man to death, and how that contrasts with the Brown case, and I'll tell you about some of the other specials coming up.

[00:51:45.841 --> 00:51:48.523]  10 seconds is not enough time to protect your family.

[00:52:09.477 --> 00:52:14.319]  Did you know by age 50, half of all men have an enlarged prostate?
[00:52:14.779 --> 00:52:21.201]  This means more urges to urinate, longer bathroom trips, waking at night to urinate, or issues with sex.

[00:53:09.045 --> 00:53:12.691]  We all have our own idea about what being safe and secure means.
[00:53:13.031 --> 00:53:18.239]  The door's locked, bills are paid, you've got a job that keeps the lights on, and a home to call your own.
[00:53:18.539 --> 00:53:20.922]  But what happens when Mother Nature throws a curveball?
[00:53:23.732 --> 00:53:27.654]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time?
[00:53:28.014 --> 00:53:29.575]  Do you even have a plan B?
[00:53:30.115 --> 00:53:33.137]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[00:53:33.437 --> 00:53:34.638]  Children left with no homes.
[00:53:34.678 --> 00:53:35.998]  And no one's coming to help them.
[00:53:36.498 --> 00:53:39.340]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster.
[00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:41.741]  is a visit to mypatriotsupply.com.

[00:54:02.065 --> 00:54:04.786]  Or visit us at mypatriotsupply.com.
[00:54:04.906 --> 00:54:08.147]  Remember, before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.
[00:54:10.478 --> 00:54:16.121]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:19.703 --> 00:54:37.353]  John Harmon that helps with the satellite uplinks and things like that up in Minnesota where GCN Radio Network is based, GCNlive.com, was talking to us during the break pointing out that when it's 20-30 below up there in Minnesota, if the power went out like it's done in Detroit for a day or so, a lot of people would die.
[00:54:38.467 --> 00:54:44.872]  And under UN Agenda 21, you're not allowed to have a fireplace or firewood or even a gas space heater as a backup.
[00:54:45.452 --> 00:54:46.533]  You just need to die.
[00:54:47.534 --> 00:54:54.599]  So everything is about not letting us be independent, not letting us be self-sufficient, letting us be totally under their control.
[00:54:54.879 --> 00:54:57.981]  You can't have a house, you can't have a car, you can't have a fireplace.
[00:54:58.061 --> 00:55:01.664]  Sorry Africa, you can't ever have a future, Obama told them.
[00:55:01.944 --> 00:55:03.866]  But that's not racist because he's black.
[00:55:04.867 --> 00:55:14.635]  See, this is about acting like the Democratic Party is against the police state and police brutality when they are up to their eyeballs in it, just like the Republican Party.
[00:55:16.656 --> 00:55:20.539]  There's the headline, EPA wants to snuff out wood and pellet stoves.
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:21.460]  It's now coming here.
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:24.222]  San Francisco's already putting taxes and regulations on them.
[00:55:24.943 --> 00:55:27.845]  John Harmon, what would happen if the power was out in Minneapolis-St.
[00:55:27.865 --> 00:55:28.386]  Paul right now?
[00:55:29.389 --> 00:55:34.911]  If the power went out for even just a few days, it would be just chaotic.
[00:55:35.151 --> 00:55:39.033]  I mean, can you only imagine how cold it is now with the heat on?
[00:55:39.293 --> 00:55:42.754]  But I mean, if the power goes out, we'd be screwed.
[00:55:42.974 --> 00:55:47.676]  I mean, there would be people, you know, raiding grocery stores within days.
[00:55:47.976 --> 00:55:51.237]  I mean, it would be just... Look at what's going on in Detroit.
[00:55:51.397 --> 00:55:53.438]  I mean, it gets cold there, too.
[00:55:53.558 --> 00:55:57.080]  But I mean, here, it's... We wouldn't be able to survive.
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:57.660]  There'd be no way.
[00:55:58.260 --> 00:55:59.681]  Well, it's racist for you to survive.
[00:55:59.721 --> 00:56:01.822]  I appreciate you coming on, John Harmon.
[00:56:02.243 --> 00:56:02.723]  Not a problem.
[00:56:03.163 --> 00:56:04.284]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:05.665 --> 00:56:11.409]  Again, I want to get into this case, but we've got a former congressman coming on to talk about the imperial presidency.
[00:56:11.789 --> 00:56:25.138]  What would Bob Barr do, as a former federal prosecutor, if he was in Congress right now, which we wish he was in Congress right now, to try to impeach Obama, try to block all these executive orders, the UN gun treaty, so much more.
[00:56:25.298 --> 00:56:26.359]  That is coming up.
[00:56:26.699 --> 00:56:27.860]  Before I go any further,
[00:56:28.919 --> 00:56:31.141]  We're running the biggest specials we ever had.
[00:56:31.201 --> 00:56:33.744]  We're extending Cyber Monday right through this whole week.
[00:56:34.124 --> 00:56:39.490]  Free shipping on everything at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:56:40.831 --> 00:56:42.713]  And MadeIn1776.com.
[00:56:43.213 --> 00:56:48.779]  Now MadeIn1776.com and InfoWarsLife.com are just subsections of InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:56:49.039 --> 00:56:50.541]  But everything on the site.
[00:56:51.394 --> 00:56:59.916]  Whether it's Made in America, new Molon Labe belt buckles, the new design, the new .50 cal Spartan design that came in with 1776 and Infowars.
[00:57:00.516 --> 00:57:01.716]  Have a limited amount of each one.
[00:57:01.756 --> 00:57:03.617]  They will sell out this month, probably.
[00:57:04.017 --> 00:57:05.057]  They'll sell out, guaranteed.
[00:57:05.077 --> 00:57:07.738]  We have the Molon Labe with an M16 belt buckles.
[00:57:08.358 --> 00:57:11.339]  The Made in America apparel, it's all Made in America.
[00:57:12.059 --> 00:57:12.919]  Free shipping.
[00:57:14.519 --> 00:57:15.540]  And big discounts.
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:20.241]  But some of the other discounts we have is seven months free
[00:57:21.477 --> 00:57:24.440]  A year, half price for PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:57:24.761 --> 00:57:26.322]  We will run out of silver.
[00:57:26.923 --> 00:57:32.229]  We were able to get even more produced, but that's it for the year from the major laboratory of Silver Bullet.
[00:57:32.689 --> 00:57:33.870]  We're just going to max it out.
[00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:36.353]  We're not going to stop the sale, even though it would sell out in a week.
[00:57:36.913 --> 00:57:38.095]  It'll probably sell out in two or three days.
[00:57:38.135 --> 00:57:38.956]  We're keeping it going.
[00:57:39.556 --> 00:57:42.119]  20% off all colloidal silver at Infowarslife.com.
[00:57:43.991 --> 00:57:50.053]  And when you buy four, you get 20% off and free shipping and get the fifth bottle free.
[00:57:50.533 --> 00:57:51.974]  Nobody's got a deal like this.
[00:57:52.254 --> 00:57:57.116]  We already had the lowest price on Silver Bullet of this quality of colloidal silver.
[00:57:57.536 --> 00:57:58.617]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:58.797 --> 00:58:00.217]  Also, buy a bottle of DNA Force.
[00:58:05.379 --> 00:58:08.241]  This is the highest quality pharmaceutical out there across the board.
[00:58:08.562 --> 00:58:16.008]  Get two bottles free of Survival Shield Super Nascent Iodine that is again set to sell out probably this week.
[00:58:16.088 --> 00:58:18.029]  Unfortunately, we're trying to get more in.
[00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:21.532]  Super Male Vitality is the leader in the sale right now.
[00:58:22.493 --> 00:58:24.455]  30% off Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality.
[00:58:24.915 --> 00:58:27.397]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:27.477 --> 00:58:28.778]  And it's so exciting because
[00:58:32.761 --> 00:58:33.341]  It's a win-win.
[00:58:33.381 --> 00:58:34.321]  It funds the operation.
[00:58:34.341 --> 00:58:35.362]  They're high-quality products.
[00:58:35.822 --> 00:58:37.402]  And people are just loving these sales.
[00:58:37.742 --> 00:58:38.902]  It's having the byproduct, though.
[00:58:38.922 --> 00:58:40.243]  It's going to run us out of our stock.
[00:58:40.563 --> 00:58:41.963]  But I'm a hardcore capitalist.
[00:58:42.083 --> 00:58:46.424]  I'm going to just double down and keep this going throughout the week or while supplies last.
[00:58:46.684 --> 00:58:50.445]  So get yours while you can and support the transmission and get high-quality products.
[00:58:50.885 --> 00:58:52.225]  I know we're hardcore free marketers.
[00:58:52.245 --> 00:58:53.065]  We're not ashamed of it.
[00:58:53.105 --> 00:58:53.465]  Sorry.
[00:58:53.825 --> 00:58:54.625]  We fund ourselves.
[00:58:54.705 --> 00:58:55.746]  We don't take taxpayer money.
[00:58:55.766 --> 00:58:56.526]  Stay with us.
[00:58:59.884 --> 00:59:03.807]  On the eve of Thanksgiving this year, I was thinking, what am I really thankful for?
[00:59:03.967 --> 00:59:12.112]  And I gotta tell you, it's my family, it's all the blessings of liberty that our forebearers secured, and it's you, the listeners of the broadcast, who've made everything we do possible.
[00:59:12.232 --> 00:59:20.178]  This Black Friday, I decided to bring you the biggest special we've ever offered on any of the Nutraceuticals at Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:20.618 --> 00:59:24.420]  I'm talking about Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver that we've been sold out of for months.
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:26.541]  This time I doubled down and got even more.
[00:59:26.822 --> 00:59:30.224]  As of me taping this on the eve of Thanksgiving, we have already sold half of it.
[00:59:30.404 --> 00:59:37.568]  So instead of keeping the price at its regular discounted price, we are going to give you 20% off and free shipping on single bottles.
[00:59:37.728 --> 00:59:41.110]  But if you get four bottles, we're gonna give you the fifth one free and the free shipping.
[00:59:41.130 --> 00:59:45.872]  I don't know how long this special will run, but if supplies last, we will extend it out until Cyber Monday.
[00:59:45.972 --> 00:59:50.055]  You'll find powerful nutraceuticals like Silver Bullet and others at Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:50.435 --> 00:59:52.156]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:15.885 --> 01:00:20.046]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:20.727 --> 01:00:21.527]  You want answers?
[01:00:22.307 --> 01:00:23.187]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.868 --> 01:00:27.529]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:28.029 --> 01:00:32.090]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:48.976 --> 01:00:54.263]  And it had to do with the stepfather of Michael Brown, who said, burn this down.
[01:00:54.703 --> 01:00:59.509]  Talking about the town of Ferguson, leading into the events of last week.
[01:00:59.930 --> 01:01:03.154]  My question is, do you believe those comments should be pursued?
[01:01:03.274 --> 01:01:04.396]  Is that inciting a riot?
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:13.828]  We are pursuing those comments, and there's a lot of discussion going on about that right now, but I really can't get into that at this time.
[01:01:14.389 --> 01:01:23.898]  Is there an atmosphere where maybe there's a group in law enforcement, maybe in the prosecutor's office, arguing that, oh, we should just let it die?
[01:01:24.619 --> 01:01:29.044]  But wouldn't that just encourage people in the future to act the same way and feel that they could get away with it?
[01:01:31.314 --> 01:01:37.216]  No, we can't let all that happened in Ferguson and Delwood and the community die.
[01:01:37.916 --> 01:01:48.599]  Everyone who is responsible for taking away people's property, their livelihoods, their jobs, their businesses, every single one of them needs to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
[01:01:48.879 --> 01:01:50.180]  What about back in August when this happened, Chief?
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.440]  I think I'm joined by all my colleagues now.
[01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:54.081]  Did you use the videotape then to go after people?
[01:01:55.701 --> 01:01:56.022]  We did.
[01:01:56.562 --> 01:01:57.382]  Yeah, okay.
[01:02:01.209 --> 01:02:09.757]  You know, let's go to this other case, because it's funny, whenever you have one of these cases, it doesn't become a big national story.
[01:02:10.417 --> 01:02:25.851]  The media chose a loser like Brown, who is strong-arming a store over cigars, probably to make blunts with, and thugging out, and was it too extreme what the cop did?
[01:02:27.065 --> 01:02:29.167]  I don't know, he says he got assaulted and then he charged him again.
[01:02:29.667 --> 01:02:31.629]  Whatever, the whole world doesn't revolve around this.
[01:02:31.649 --> 01:02:32.850]  It's like a drama queen.
[01:02:33.811 --> 01:02:34.932]  Bad stuff happens all the time.
[01:02:35.913 --> 01:02:40.497]  People, I probably know six, seven people that have like schizophrenic brothers or sisters.
[01:02:41.138 --> 01:02:47.224]  In fact, I had it happen to some distant family, not too distant, but the husband of my great aunt, who just died recently.
[01:02:48.965 --> 01:02:49.285]  You know, her.
[01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:51.930]  Second husband after a death.
[01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:58.053]  The point is, his daughter had schizophrenia, a mental disorder, and freaked out and the cops came to her house.
[01:02:58.073 --> 01:02:58.533]  She was unarmed.
[01:02:58.553 --> 01:02:59.754]  They shot her, thinking she was armed.
[01:03:00.674 --> 01:03:03.356]  I mean, is the whole world going to be burned down because of it?
[01:03:03.376 --> 01:03:10.039]  There's just countless examples of mentally ill people that I've known, or people that I know that know them, who get killed by the police.
[01:03:11.619 --> 01:03:12.140]  That's not a thing.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:15.141]  I wouldn't just call the cops unless you really got an emergency going on.
[01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:18.151]  Because you don't know what's going to happen.
[01:03:18.171 --> 01:03:19.692]  You don't know if you're going to get a bad cop.
[01:03:19.732 --> 01:03:21.132]  You don't know if you're going to get a stupid cop.
[01:03:21.433 --> 01:03:22.113]  A scared cop.
[01:03:23.614 --> 01:03:24.954]  It's a dangerous situation.
[01:03:24.994 --> 01:03:29.697]  People call the cops now if their McDonald's cheeseburger is cold.
[01:03:29.737 --> 01:03:30.497]  That was a real case.
[01:03:31.158 --> 01:03:34.419]  Or if their son or daughter, their five-year-old, is not doing what mommy says.
[01:03:34.439 --> 01:03:35.280]  You call the police.
[01:03:37.321 --> 01:03:38.762]  Well, we have the case here.
[01:03:38.782 --> 01:03:40.562]  We're going to talk more about it later.
[01:03:40.582 --> 01:03:43.244]  In Staten Island of Eric Gardner.
[01:03:46.047 --> 01:03:56.690]  Garner, being choked to death, and he's just got his hands up talking to the police, going, hey, hey, hey, I don't, you know, need to be arrested, blah, blah, blah.
[01:03:57.130 --> 01:04:09.413]  Boom, they get him, they slam him down, and everybody's seen this, where the person's not resisting the cop, and they say, get on the ground, they throw you down, and go ahead and jump on your back with their knees, or jump on your head, or knock your head in the ground.
[01:04:10.253 --> 01:04:12.994]  I've been arrested a few times demonstrating.
[01:04:14.062 --> 01:04:20.646]  And in every case but once, they knocked my head into things and shoved me around and put the handcuffs on too tight.
[01:04:23.468 --> 01:04:25.409]  Then one time, I went down to the Travis County Jail.
[01:04:26.289 --> 01:04:28.931]  The one time they didn't rough me up, the state police didn't rough me up.
[01:04:29.291 --> 01:04:33.774]  And when I get there, this little short redhead guy goes, oh Alex Jones, you really think you're something, huh?
[01:04:33.814 --> 01:04:34.254]  Turn around.
[01:04:35.315 --> 01:04:38.177]  And shoved my face and nose enough to give me a bruise.
[01:04:39.252 --> 01:04:39.852]  Into the wall.
[01:04:40.713 --> 01:04:42.353]  And he's like, oh, you gotta do something?
[01:04:42.373 --> 01:04:43.314]  You gotta do something?
[01:04:43.714 --> 01:04:47.756]  I mean, so obviously a bunch of cowardly nobodies try to get jobs like that.
[01:04:47.816 --> 01:04:48.336]  Not everybody.
[01:04:48.716 --> 01:04:50.337]  But there's that factor in there.
[01:04:50.377 --> 01:04:51.077]  There's that element.
[01:04:51.457 --> 01:04:53.338]  And I don't know why it's allowed to flourish.
[01:04:53.718 --> 01:04:54.938]  We're all upset about that.
[01:04:55.019 --> 01:04:56.059]  Those of us that want justice.
[01:04:56.819 --> 01:04:57.820]  But Brown ain't it.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:00.061]  And it's all a big globalist U.N.
[01:05:00.121 --> 01:05:02.662]  program to stir up division in this country.
[01:05:02.682 --> 01:05:06.583]  And to legitimize killing white people with hammers.
[01:05:06.603 --> 01:05:08.144]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[01:05:09.946 --> 01:05:14.229]  For months, the Infowars Live Silver Bullet colloidal silver has been completely sold out.
[01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:19.594]  Now, we have finally procured a limited supply from one of the leading manufacturers of nutraceuticals in the nation.
[01:05:19.714 --> 01:05:21.615]  But here's what's truly exciting.
[01:05:21.776 --> 01:05:32.064]  While we could simply sell the survival silver for its already discounted shelf price, we have decided to give back to you, the listeners, who make it all possible with a pre-Black Friday mega sale.
[01:05:32.184 --> 01:05:35.026]  We are launching this mega special with an unprecedented 20% off
[01:05:36.067 --> 01:05:40.609]  And free shipping on all Silver Bullet across the board while supplies last.
[01:05:40.809 --> 01:05:43.210]  And to help everyone stock up before the next shortage.
[01:05:43.370 --> 01:05:47.732]  When you buy 4 bottles of Silver Bullet, you will receive the 5th one absolutely free.
[01:05:47.913 --> 01:05:50.914]  That's on top of the 20% off savings and free shipping.
[01:05:50.994 --> 01:05:55.176]  Finally, if supplies hold, we will extend this special out to Cyber Monday.
[01:05:55.416 --> 01:05:58.057]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've never done anything like this before.
[01:05:58.337 --> 01:06:03.919]  Find this mother of all specials and others I've not yet announced yet at InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:06:03.979 --> 01:06:05.040]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:06:10.031 --> 01:06:13.533]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:06:13.673 --> 01:06:17.654]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:06:17.955 --> 01:06:19.415]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:06:19.735 --> 01:06:24.778]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[01:06:25.078 --> 01:06:27.319]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[01:06:27.599 --> 01:06:28.439]  But for how long?
[01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:30.740]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:06:30.961 --> 01:06:35.002]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:06:35.383 --> 01:06:38.184]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:06:39.727 --> 01:06:43.590]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[01:06:44.330 --> 01:06:50.595]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.
[01:06:50.715 --> 01:06:59.761]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior vitality in males and females.
[01:07:00.121 --> 01:07:04.965]  Supercharge and conquer your world at InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:07:09.528 --> 01:07:13.390]  On the eve of Thanksgiving this year, I was thinking, what am I really thankful for?
[01:07:13.590 --> 01:07:21.715]  And I gotta tell you, it's my family, it's all the blessings of liberty that our forebearers secured, and it's you, the listeners of the broadcast, who've made everything we do possible.
[01:07:21.895 --> 01:07:29.799]  This Black Friday, I decided to bring you the biggest special we've ever offered on any of the Nutraceuticals at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:30.259 --> 01:07:34.022]  I'm talking about Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver that we've been sold out of for months.
[01:07:34.282 --> 01:07:36.163]  This time I doubled down and got even more.
[01:07:36.443 --> 01:07:39.926]  As of me taping this on the eve of Thanksgiving, we have already sold half of it.
[01:07:40.026 --> 01:07:47.191]  So instead of keeping the price at its regular discounted price, we are going to give you 20% off and free shipping on single bottles.
[01:07:47.371 --> 01:07:50.733]  But if you get four bottles, we're gonna give you the fifth one free and the free shipping.
[01:07:50.753 --> 01:07:55.517]  I don't know how long this special will run, but if supplies last, we will extend it out until Cyber Monday.
[01:07:55.597 --> 01:07:59.680]  You'll find powerful nutraceuticals like Silver Bullet and others at Infowarslife.com.
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:03.123]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:03.143 --> 01:08:04.404]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:34.963 --> 01:08:42.387]  Well we're joined by the head of Liberty Guard that's fighting against the police state nationwide and what the TSA is up to.
[01:08:42.427 --> 01:08:51.713]  He's also a former congressman and he's the man that introduced the impeachment articles against William Jefferson Clinton and of course he's former congressman Bob Barr.
[01:08:52.393 --> 01:09:01.078]  He was way ahead in polls and I thought he was going to get in in that district in Georgia there outside Atlanta but he lost to the Tea Party candidate.
[01:09:01.679 --> 01:09:03.120]  And it's kind of a paradox because
[01:09:04.486 --> 01:09:10.149]  I'm a big Tea Party guy, but I knew that Bob Barr, on almost every issue, was an outsider.
[01:09:10.189 --> 01:09:20.294]  He was exposing the NSA, the police state, fighting against gun control, and trying to impeach Bill Clinton whenever the establishment didn't want that.
[01:09:21.286 --> 01:09:35.731]  So, whereas I think the candidate that beat him is a fine person, it shows how powerful the huge backlash was against any incumbent, even though Barr wasn't an incumbent and had been out of Congress for a while.
[01:09:36.331 --> 01:09:38.872]  I wanted Barr to be in there because he would start the impeachment.
[01:09:39.192 --> 01:09:40.573]  He said, boom, first day.
[01:09:41.173 --> 01:09:46.080]  Now Obama says he's going after the guns using UN treaty, not law.
[01:09:46.481 --> 01:09:48.203]  He says he's shutting off more power plants.
[01:09:48.503 --> 01:09:49.925]  He's doing naked amnesty.
[01:09:50.626 --> 01:09:54.411]  He is putting our troops under more NATO-UN control.
[01:09:54.952 --> 01:09:58.056]  Across the board, acting unilaterally.
[01:09:59.019 --> 01:10:05.202]  And he's got two years left, so I want to talk to Bob Barr first briefly about his election to see if he concurs with what I just said.
[01:10:05.922 --> 01:10:13.285]  And then I want to get into the UN saying not just the people of America need to be disarmed, but the police as well.
[01:10:13.365 --> 01:10:23.189]  See, only the UN under their memorandum 7277 and UNESCO, that they believe is law even if we don't ratify it, only the UN has the weapons.
[01:10:23.809 --> 01:10:24.630]  How creepy
[01:10:25.751 --> 01:10:29.056]  is that, and that's the headline at Infowars.com, U.N.
[01:10:29.116 --> 01:10:29.897]  attacks, U.S.
[01:10:29.957 --> 01:10:32.762]  gun rights, and more, citing Ferguson and the police.
[01:10:33.282 --> 01:10:36.647]  In my mind, and we'll talk about this as well, there's no doubt
[01:10:37.915 --> 01:10:42.736]  That they're trying to cause racial division, riots in America, because that's all Obama's got.
[01:10:43.076 --> 01:10:50.778]  We'll have Bob Barr put on his former CIA hat, and his former federal prosecutor hat, to ask where he thinks all this is going.
[01:10:50.818 --> 01:11:04.941]  But the NFL, the Black Caucus in Congress, holding up their hands, don't shoot, implying that white people inherently want to kill black people, and that police inherently are involved in police shootings, and are guilty for what another cop does.
[01:11:05.421 --> 01:11:06.381]  I mean, this is race
[01:11:06.561 --> 01:11:10.244]  That's class warfare right out of the Joe Stalin book, in my view.
[01:11:10.424 --> 01:11:11.464]  Now that's a mouthful.
[01:11:12.245 --> 01:11:15.948]  Again, former Congressman Bob Barr joins us.
[01:11:16.588 --> 01:11:26.555]  Let's go through all those points, sir, but first off, the election, the Tea Party victories, what do you think that says to the establishment?
[01:11:27.398 --> 01:11:31.681]  Well, first of all, Alex, great to be with you and your listeners once again.
[01:11:31.801 --> 01:11:39.227]  It's always great to get into these topics with you, because not only do you understand them, but your listeners do as well.
[01:11:39.247 --> 01:11:44.731]  They understand the importance of the fundamental principles that we're talking about here.
[01:11:44.751 --> 01:11:56.099]  It was a strange election, not only in my race for the 11th District here in Georgia, but in a couple of other races in Georgia, and I noticed elsewhere as well.
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:12.972]  Anybody who had any experience or prior service in Washington, such as I did, having served, as you mentioned, as the first to call for William Jefferson Clinton to be impeached back in the mid and late 1990s,
[01:12:15.594 --> 01:12:23.021]  Anybody who had any experience up there was labeled, as my opponent labeled me, as the establishment.
[01:12:23.061 --> 01:12:28.686]  Now, anybody who knows me knows that, you know, I'm anything but the establishment.
[01:12:29.126 --> 01:12:33.190]  But that was truly a deciding factor.
[01:12:34.491 --> 01:12:49.430]  So, you know, Jack Kingston, for example, even though Jack Kingston, former member of the Appropriations Committee, and he was and is still a sitting member of Congress, he gave up his House seat to run for the Senate.
[01:12:50.670 --> 01:12:54.853]  And I think he suffered the same thing, even though he truly was an incumbent.
[01:12:55.293 --> 01:12:58.975]  But there still are a lot of issues out there.
[01:12:59.095 --> 01:13:08.640]  I remain just as committed to fighting for the Constitution and the causes and the principles that it represents as you do.
[01:13:09.161 --> 01:13:18.366]  Whether I'm in office or not, I certainly would have enjoyed serving the people of America once again in the House to use the
[01:13:18.906 --> 01:13:27.071]  Yeah, the background, the experience that I have to fight against increases in government power and limitations on individual liberty.
[01:13:27.091 --> 01:13:33.675]  I didn't get that chance this time, but I'm continuing to fight the good fight from the private sector.
[01:13:34.215 --> 01:13:38.819]  Well sure, I mean it'd be like not voting for Ron Paul if he ran again because he'd already been in there.
[01:13:38.839 --> 01:13:52.211]  I mean I see it as overall a positive sign that people are really fed up, but it still shows that they're not overall educated though on how to in some cases go with somebody that has experience.
[01:13:53.536 --> 01:13:56.879]  And you know will actually go after people.
[01:13:56.979 --> 01:14:01.983]  I mean, as a prosecutor, I would guess that's why you had the cojones to do that.
[01:14:02.003 --> 01:14:06.807]  I mean, it's obviously dangerous to try to impeach a sitting president, especially Slick Willie.
[01:14:07.348 --> 01:14:14.214]  And these new Tea Party people that have gotten in, they better deliver or they're going to be in deep trouble with their constituents.
[01:14:15.951 --> 01:14:17.352]  You're absolutely correct.
[01:14:17.953 --> 01:14:19.634]  I love the Tea Party movement.
[01:14:19.654 --> 01:14:20.895]  I think it's very healthy.
[01:14:21.476 --> 01:14:24.478]  We have some very strong Tea Party groups here in Georgia.
[01:14:24.559 --> 01:14:34.767]  I mean, Jenny Beth Martin, the head of Tea Party Patriots, is here in Georgia and got her start in politics working in one of my campaigns back in 2002.
[01:14:39.251 --> 01:14:53.962]  Yeah, there are some folks that are involved with the Tea Party that just don't quite understand that we need to use those Tea Party values in conjunction with people who know how to move them forward.
[01:14:55.363 --> 01:15:03.969]  At the same time, we need people up in Washington who have the courage to say no to government spending, government power.
[01:15:04.549 --> 01:15:15.134]  At the same time, we do need some people up there who understand how to move our constitutional agenda forward, and that's what we're missing in a lot of these cases.
[01:15:15.914 --> 01:15:17.555]  Well, the real battle begins.
[01:15:17.635 --> 01:15:20.996]  What do you expect Obama to now do that he's a lame duck?
[01:15:21.036 --> 01:15:27.799]  We're seeing unprecedented power grabs, even Krauthammer saying it's time to impeach him.
[01:15:28.819 --> 01:15:31.761]  Turley, who's a liberal, says that he's tripled the abuses of Bush.
[01:15:32.501 --> 01:15:46.402]  I mean, if he opens the borders to all the illegals, which he's already done, but does an executive order, if he keeps, you know, shutting off power plants, and all these other executive actions, and going after our guns, I mean, this is outrageous!
[01:15:47.746 --> 01:15:48.487]  It truly is.
[01:15:49.267 --> 01:16:04.919]  As bad as Bill Clinton was, and he was a bad president, there is no way of sugarcoating that, certainly, but as bad as he was, he did not have the deep-seated ideological arrogance that is at the core of Barack Obama.
[01:16:05.619 --> 01:16:08.821]  Bill Clinton was very much a narcissist.
[01:16:08.841 --> 01:16:26.052]  I mean, as long as he was happy and got the things that he wanted and was able to use the perks of power, whether it was first as the governor of Arkansas to his own benefit and then as president of the United States to his own benefit, he was happy.
[01:16:26.732 --> 01:16:31.975]  He was a happy camper, you know, as long as he could have the women and so forth and travel and whatnot.
[01:16:35.959 --> 01:16:39.685]  Barack Obama is a very, very different animal.
[01:16:39.745 --> 01:16:48.460]  This man has more hubris and arrogance than anybody else that I've ever come across in public life.
[01:16:49.639 --> 01:17:05.103]  He truly believes that he is the chosen one, that because he was elected and then re-elected as president, that puts him in a plane above everybody else in the country, including even members of his own party.
[01:17:06.243 --> 01:17:14.265]  You talk with members, Democratic members of the House and the Senate in private, and a lot of them will say, this guy, this president,
[01:17:15.009 --> 01:17:15.369]  I don't know.
[01:17:36.284 --> 01:17:56.319]  He will simply shift gears, not worry about going to Harry Reid for anything, and simply use the power that he believes he has and can wield as president, quite regardless of whether or not there is any constitutional or historic basis for what he's doing.
[01:17:57.219 --> 01:18:01.583]  We are entering, Alex, a very dangerous period in American history with this man.
[01:18:02.509 --> 01:18:05.152]  And that's why I wish that Ron Paul was still in Congress.
[01:18:05.212 --> 01:18:14.781]  I wish you were there as well, because I don't even see any of these new people, the lot of them that are great folks, challenging Boehner, challenging McConnell.
[01:18:14.801 --> 01:18:17.684]  I mean, they need to be putting heat on them.
[01:18:18.365 --> 01:18:21.207]  To go after Obama and to rein him in and block him.
[01:18:21.227 --> 01:18:26.391]  I know they follow the lawsuit, but I mean you're the former congressman and a former federal prosecutor.
[01:18:26.731 --> 01:18:34.316]  What is the proper move in Congress right now and what would you be doing to try to pressure Boehner and others to take that action?
[01:18:35.617 --> 01:18:39.380]  Reminding them that they have, they in the House and in the Senate,
[01:18:40.111 --> 01:19:09.714]  Have a constitutional responsibility, not a political responsibility, but a constitutional responsibility to ensure that within the legislative branch, and that includes appropriations of all funds that are used by the executive branch, they have an absolute responsibility to ensure that the law is being followed, that the intent of the legislation passed by the Congresses and signed by Presidents
[01:19:10.214 --> 01:19:10.574]  We're good.
[01:19:23.610 --> 01:19:34.873]  Not only steps that can be taken, but must be taken to stop the expenditure of any taxpayer dollars for actions that are unconstitutional by this president.
[01:19:35.894 --> 01:19:47.777]  This notion I saw somewhere that one of the top Republican leaders in the House was saying, well, we can't stop appropriated funds from being used
[01:19:48.317 --> 01:19:50.138]  I mean, that's just absolute nonsense.
[01:19:50.298 --> 01:19:56.921]  Every one of the departments, offices, individual positions in the executive branch
[01:20:09.691 --> 01:20:14.673]  is funded through appropriations passed by law by the Congress.
[01:20:15.413 --> 01:20:22.996]  And no funds can be used under our Constitution, but as have been authorized and appropriated by the Congress.
[01:20:23.516 --> 01:20:33.980]  The Congress absolutely can deny any funds from being used for any particular purpose, such as carrying out an executive order that is unconstitutional.
[01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:41.525]  And this notion that, well, we can't do it, it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, Alex.
[01:20:41.745 --> 01:20:47.009]  Well, they also lie, because I've studied it, I know you have as well, under Bush Sr.
[01:20:47.089 --> 01:21:03.039]  and under Reagan, when they did executive actions, it was to line up, working with Congress, and with laws passed in Congress for the previous amnesties that were targeted and much smaller, but also criticized, this is the President operating
[01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:14.876]  Against the Congress, just like he's doing on carbon taxes and CO2, just like he's doing on military action, just like he's doing on gun control.
[01:21:14.976 --> 01:21:18.662]  I mean, on so many issues, he's just doing whatever he wants.
[01:21:20.414 --> 01:21:23.558]  And Congress just sort of sits back and says, thank you, sir.
[01:21:23.618 --> 01:21:24.839]  May we have another, sir?
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:41.016]  And every time they do that, in other words, every time the Congress does nothing in the face of a president essentially thumbing his nose at the Congress saying, I am not going to follow a law passed by Congress or I am going to follow a
[01:21:43.968 --> 01:21:44.528]  We're good to go.
[01:22:02.501 --> 01:22:15.811]  Yeah, this is why, you know, one of the things that we're doing at Liberty Guard, and I appreciate your mentioning our LibertyGuard.org site, is we have a site called LameDuckDynasty.org.
[01:22:17.770 --> 01:22:31.313]  To highlight the importance right now during this lame duck session of the citizenry getting involved and putting pressure on the House and Senate Republican leaders to stop this.
[01:22:31.333 --> 01:22:40.594]  So we're encouraging people not just to go to LibertyGuard.org but to LameDuckDynasty.org and helping us out.
[01:22:40.654 --> 01:22:41.415]  Spread the word.
[01:22:41.455 --> 01:22:43.275]  This is a very dangerous time.
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:50.126]  Well, for those that don't know, you go to libertyguard.org, you've got a lot of resources, legal tips, facts.
[01:22:50.966 --> 01:23:00.857]  Again, we're not attacking the average TSA person, but naked body scanners, groping children, taking our shoes off while our own government funds ISIS and these other radical groups.
[01:23:00.997 --> 01:23:03.380]  I mean, it's all about training us that we don't have rights.
[01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:05.542]  It's a social engineering program.
[01:23:06.752 --> 01:23:07.672]  Plain and simple.
[01:23:08.293 --> 01:23:11.374]  And I just really appreciate the fact that you've been leading the charge.
[01:23:11.654 --> 01:23:14.775]  Now they're trying to get you to pre-check in.
[01:23:15.215 --> 01:23:24.739]  And I'm telling you, I like the idea of convenience, doing an interview with the TSA, doing a screening process, and then I don't have to go through all that added security.
[01:23:24.859 --> 01:23:25.660]  The problem is...
[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:31.645]  Is that then they'll just bring it back on everybody later once everyone gets permission to travel.
[01:23:32.045 --> 01:23:37.369]  This is the idea they're introducing internal checkpoints while our borders are wide open.
[01:23:37.389 --> 01:23:50.641]  I mean, how can our borders be wide open and the Border Patrol be completing the smuggling process, as one Border Patrol agent said, shipping them in with vouchers, but then I have to go through internal checkpoints
[01:23:51.321 --> 01:23:58.070]  And be, you know, asked questions with these screening programs where they do behavioral analysis on me.
[01:23:59.486 --> 01:24:03.227]  BDOs, Behavior Detection Officers.
[01:24:04.988 --> 01:24:13.291]  It reminds me, particularly the way you've accurately described it there Alex, of the old Superman bizarro world.
[01:24:13.311 --> 01:24:21.494]  You know, where Superman somehow would go into this dimension, this bizarro dimension, where everything is the opposite of the way it is in the real world.
[01:24:22.014 --> 01:24:23.154]  You're absolutely correct.
[01:24:23.975 --> 01:24:24.575]  Here we are.
[01:24:25.335 --> 01:24:44.005]  Uh, with, uh, not only are borders essentially wide open, but, you know, Obama and the Department of Homeland Security people just standing on our side of the border, you know, waving people in, please come in, andale, andale, uh, and then at the same time we're subjecting American citizens
[01:24:44.725 --> 01:25:06.935]  Who have, often forgotten, a legally recognized right to travel being denied that fundamental right to travel simply because government agents have decided that they're going to stop you from doing so unless you do everything that they tell you to do.
[01:25:08.456 --> 01:25:16.781]  And every time they come up, you've mentioned Alex, this pre-TSA pre-check program, they can never even make up their minds on that.
[01:25:16.841 --> 01:25:26.728]  They start that pre-check program, seems to be working fairly well, and now, somebody was telling me the other day that, well, now they're making it random.
[01:25:27.008 --> 01:25:33.833]  So, you sign up for it, and you go through, and sometimes it allows you to use it, sometimes it doesn't.
[01:25:34.333 --> 01:25:40.581]  I mean, the nonsense, absolute, utter nonsense that you have to go through in order to exercise what the U.S.
[01:25:40.601 --> 01:25:52.797]  Supreme Court recognized half a century ago as a fundamental right, and that is the right to travel, is absolutely meaningless nowadays in the name of so-called security.
[01:25:53.524 --> 01:25:53.944]  Exactly.
[01:25:53.964 --> 01:25:58.786]  You can't have the federal government stick a checkpoint in front of something and say, this is the rules.
[01:25:59.366 --> 01:26:02.046]  I mean, you're a lawyer, you're an expert on these things, but explain it to me.
[01:26:03.327 --> 01:26:04.947]  But I'll tell you the common law, it's pretty simple.
[01:26:05.007 --> 01:26:13.810]  If the airline itself wanted to say, once you get to our gate, we're going to search you, you would decide whether or not you wanted to go through that.
[01:26:14.090 --> 01:26:17.891]  Maybe one airline didn't do it, one airline did, but that's free market.
[01:26:18.171 --> 01:26:21.552]  But you don't have the government itself say, it's a privilege to travel.
[01:26:22.315 --> 01:26:22.775]  That's right.
[01:26:23.856 --> 01:26:28.099]  It's no longer a right as almost everything that the government deals with nowadays.
[01:26:28.639 --> 01:26:30.060]  It's not a right, it's a privilege.
[01:26:31.501 --> 01:26:46.452]  I was talking with a local reporter here in Marietta, Georgia the other day about a local police department that is spending a bunch of money to get a new license plate reader system.
[01:26:47.348 --> 01:27:05.146]  Uh, and, you know, they were saying, well, gee, you know, now, uh, you know, we can, during the holiday shopping season, we can send a patrol car through a mall, uh, parking lot, and within a matter of minutes, identify any, uh, any cars that, uh, that might have warrants outstanding or are stolen.
[01:27:05.786 --> 01:27:06.687]  Uh, now, wait a minute.
[01:27:07.879 --> 01:27:23.129]  Now, if I want to go to a church, or I want to go to a business, or I want to go to a political event, or I just want to go out shopping, I'm subject now to having my license plate read, recorded, and a record made of that.
[01:27:23.149 --> 01:27:26.031]  And where you went, and that's what it's really all about.
[01:27:29.216 --> 01:27:36.263]  It's just outrageous, and most of this is being driven by the tail wagging the dog, and that is federal monies.
[01:27:36.803 --> 01:27:47.093]  Federal monies are being made available to local police departments with this whiz-bang technology, so they snap it up, and we'll worry about the details later.
[01:27:47.133 --> 01:27:48.214]  Trust us, they say.
[01:27:48.654 --> 01:27:49.575]  Well, I don't.
[01:27:49.715 --> 01:27:50.776]  I don't trust government.
[01:27:51.564 --> 01:27:58.587]  Well, we know that they've been secretly, since Bill Clinton's days, putting up, in tests, federal license plate reading cameras on major highways.
[01:27:58.647 --> 01:28:07.971]  Now they're proliferating all over the place, and imagine if Nazi Germany or the Soviets would have had this type of technology, what they would have done.
[01:28:08.051 --> 01:28:10.832]  These things always get abused, and as you said,
[01:28:11.252 --> 01:28:15.976]  They've caught San Francisco using them a few years ago to track where everybody goes and creating records.
[01:28:16.036 --> 01:28:18.478]  Now they want to use them to tax you by the mile.
[01:28:19.078 --> 01:28:20.820]  They use them at a lot of the toll roads now.
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:25.904]  It's proliferating and it destroys any level of privacy.
[01:28:25.944 --> 01:28:35.331]  We've only got about 10 minutes left with former Congressman Bob Barr, then we'll open the phones up and take calls and get into some other news, but we've got about a minute and a half before we go to break, sir.
[01:28:35.912 --> 01:28:39.054]  Shifting gears into Ferguson, I mean, in my
[01:28:40.295 --> 01:28:43.938]  This is total race baiting by the Democrats to change the subject.
[01:28:44.758 --> 01:28:50.822]  We've got attacks on whites, hammer murders going on, Farrakhan Singh basically killed people.
[01:28:51.583 --> 01:28:57.386]  The Democrats, President Obama came out yesterday and said these youth have done nothing but done the right thing.
[01:28:57.987 --> 01:29:02.650]  I mean this is legitimizing a lot of criminal activity and equating it with free speech.
[01:29:02.690 --> 01:29:04.651]  What do you think the endgame is here?
[01:29:05.829 --> 01:29:12.992]  The endgame is the same as it is whether we're talking about TSA or the FEC or the FCC.
[01:29:13.293 --> 01:29:15.774]  It's all about the big C, control.
[01:29:16.974 --> 01:29:33.522]  One of the other aspects of what we see happening in Ferguson, I know you've looked at this and noticed this also Alex, in addition to the rampant criminal activity and the race baiting and so forth that's been going on there.
[01:29:34.722 --> 01:29:39.804]  There was a very interesting sort of little noticed aspect of this.
[01:29:40.364 --> 01:29:43.425]  There was a group of folks called Oath Keepers.
[01:29:43.545 --> 01:29:45.365]  Ah, let's talk about them when we come back.
[01:29:45.765 --> 01:29:46.585]  Private citizens.
[01:29:46.665 --> 01:29:48.986]  I'd love to chat about that and where that's taken us.
[01:29:49.026 --> 01:29:49.386]  That's right.
[01:29:49.406 --> 01:29:52.347]  In fact, the police tried to basically shut that down.
[01:29:52.387 --> 01:29:54.768]  How dare private citizens try to stop the crime?
[01:29:54.988 --> 01:29:55.548]  We'll be back.
[01:29:55.588 --> 01:29:56.008]  Stay with us.
[01:29:59.317 --> 01:30:02.326]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.

[01:30:11.218 --> 01:30:12.279]  In the near future.
[01:30:12.559 --> 01:30:16.700]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:30:17.061 --> 01:30:18.061]  Security alert.
[01:30:18.281 --> 01:30:20.022]  This is Homeland Security.

[01:33:06.293 --> 01:33:06.493]  GCN.
[01:33:37.390 --> 01:33:39.032]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:33:39.152 --> 01:33:45.718]  Former Congressman Bob Barr, the head of LibertyGuard.org, is riding shotgun with us for another 10 minutes or so.
[01:33:46.419 --> 01:33:50.983]  Then I will get into other news that's breaking at InfoWars.com and open the phones up.
[01:33:51.023 --> 01:33:52.925]  I'll give out the number coming up in about 10 minutes.
[01:33:54.046 --> 01:33:57.589]  You were getting into Oath Keepers when the break cut you off.
[01:33:58.270 --> 01:33:59.270]  Tell folks about that.
[01:34:00.552 --> 01:34:01.533]  Thank you once again, Alex.
[01:34:03.827 --> 01:34:22.931]  A lot of folks may not have noticed it, but shortly after the start of the most recent round of riots and lawlessness in Ferguson, there were a number of individuals who appeared to help businesses and on rooftops to help maintain order.
[01:34:23.592 --> 01:34:24.512]  These were
[01:34:26.573 --> 01:34:39.757]  Private citizens, law-abiding private citizens, many of them military veterans, former law enforcement, and first responders, who simply have taken an oath to protect and uphold the Constitution.
[01:34:40.097 --> 01:34:43.298]  And they went to Ferguson, put themselves at risk,
[01:34:43.878 --> 01:34:50.342]  Go in there on their own to simply help local business and property owners protect their businesses.
[01:34:51.542 --> 01:34:58.506]  And rather than the police authorities in Missouri and Ferguson say, we really appreciate this.
[01:34:58.606 --> 01:35:00.027]  Thank you for helping us out.
[01:35:00.067 --> 01:35:01.307]  We obviously need the help.
[01:35:01.908 --> 01:35:03.248]  What did they get for their efforts?
[01:35:03.708 --> 01:35:10.132]  The Oath Keepers were told to get out of town or they'd be arrested because they didn't have licenses
[01:35:10.928 --> 01:35:12.529]  To do what they were doing.
[01:35:12.549 --> 01:35:18.551]  That is simply helping individual citizens and business owners protect their property.
[01:35:18.571 --> 01:35:24.514]  This is the state of affairs in America and the Western world today.
[01:35:25.214 --> 01:35:32.977]  Citizens who wish to help maintain order and protect their rights and to carry out
[01:35:33.437 --> 01:35:38.181]  They're God-given responsibility to protect themselves and their fellow citizens.
[01:35:38.541 --> 01:35:40.423]  That's not ultimately the job of the police.
[01:35:40.523 --> 01:35:54.955]  It's the job and the responsibility of individual citizens are now being told by police, not only do we not want your help, but you're going to be arrested if you continue to help because it's against public safety.
[01:35:55.295 --> 01:36:02.721]  We, the police, are responsible for public safety and anybody who interferes with that by trying to protect themselves and others will be arrested.
[01:36:03.629 --> 01:36:08.970]  Well, that's what's happening here, and again, I've looked at the state laws in Missouri on this.
[01:36:08.990 --> 01:36:14.472]  We've had Stuart Rose, who's a constitutional lawyer, on and the head of Oath Keepers on the nightly news to discuss what happened.
[01:36:15.572 --> 01:36:19.033]  The business owners asked them and said, yes, please do come.
[01:36:19.493 --> 01:36:21.994]  We've had some of the business owners on, the gun shops and others.
[01:36:22.434 --> 01:36:30.316]  They wanted the Oath Keepers to be on top of their property, and I think the police are wrong that even free association
[01:36:32.125 --> 01:36:36.809]  Someone says, yes, please be here and help protect me, and it's a private citizen doing it.
[01:36:36.869 --> 01:36:44.717]  It's not commerce, and so it's not subject to licensure, and I believe that's a fraudulent, unlawful order given by the police.
[01:36:46.415 --> 01:36:47.636]  It clearly is.
[01:36:48.936 --> 01:36:50.917]  But it's typical of government, Alex.
[01:36:50.977 --> 01:36:52.178]  We see it in so many ways.
[01:36:52.618 --> 01:36:54.799]  Government wants to have its cake and eat it, too.
[01:36:54.999 --> 01:37:06.404]  On the one hand, the police don't want to be liable for citizens being harmed, so they take the position, which is actually a legitimate one, that, you know,
[01:37:07.262 --> 01:37:21.932]  That people don't have a right to be protected by the police, but then on the other hand, they want to control people so they don't want to leave the citizenry with the tools in their hands to actually protect themselves.
[01:37:21.972 --> 01:37:31.178]  So they say, well, yes, we don't have a responsibility to protect you because if we did, then if we didn't, we could be liable for it, but
[01:37:31.878 --> 01:37:36.943]  We're going to be the ones that decide when and how to protect you, not you.
[01:37:36.963 --> 01:37:52.718]  And that sets the whole notion of individual responsibility and individual God-given rights on its head and places absolute control, which is what government wants, in the hands of government officials.
[01:37:54.107 --> 01:38:15.165]  You're right, and to have the police freak out and come up and say, hey, come down, basically with your hands up, you can't be on that rooftop, even after they talked to the business owners and said, no, no, we want them there, it's that image of citizens with guns that makes the state so upset because they want the monopoly of control.
[01:38:16.146 --> 01:38:18.488]  I'm sure the average cops appreciate Oath Keepers.
[01:38:19.329 --> 01:38:22.830]  But at the same time, the bureaucrats, they want that monopoly.
[01:38:23.210 --> 01:38:24.311]  Just like in the L.A.
[01:38:24.371 --> 01:38:32.073]  riots when the police stood down because they didn't want to be called, you know, police brutality or abusers or racists.
[01:38:32.674 --> 01:38:41.537]  Then it was the Korean shopkeepers protecting the whole neighborhood with their shotguns and the media back during the 92 riots asked, you know, should they be arrested?
[01:38:41.877 --> 01:38:44.978]  Should they be allowed to not have their businesses burned down?
[01:38:44.998 --> 01:38:47.879]  I mean, the ultimate crime in this society now
[01:38:48.559 --> 01:38:54.524]  It's like public schools teach kids, don't fight back if a bully attacks you, get in a fetal position.
[01:38:54.925 --> 01:39:02.271]  And they teach people now that have home invasions, don't have a gun, play dead, or urinate on them.
[01:39:02.331 --> 01:39:04.613]  I mean, I'm not trying to be gross here, that's what they teach.
[01:39:07.336 --> 01:39:08.837]  I hadn't heard that one before.
[01:39:09.278 --> 01:39:10.499]  I promise, I'm not kidding.
[01:39:12.736 --> 01:39:15.998]  I know it's not funny, but it's so ludicrous.
[01:39:16.519 --> 01:39:26.304]  And again, it gets us back to that image that I keep coming back to with how strange things have gotten to the old bizarro world.
[01:39:28.510 --> 01:39:45.239]  Hopefully, Alex, through your work and the work of other folks who really understand and are willing to put their reputations and jobs on the line in support of the Constitution, we can start to turn this around in the next couple of years.
[01:39:46.059 --> 01:39:51.922]  But darn, we've got to have new and stronger leadership in the House and the Senate.
[01:39:52.595 --> 01:40:08.480]  And we've got to really pay attention and get involved with the presidential primary coming up, because if we lose again, I'm not sure where we're going to wind up.
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:16.603]  I mean, I know I'm going to continue fighting, and I know you will, but we don't have a lot of time left to start turning this thing around.
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:21.102]  It's a best-of-times, worst-of-times scenario from my view.
[01:40:21.142 --> 01:40:29.629]  There's never been more hardcore people of all race, colors and creeds awake to the basic tenets of liberty and the problems of tyranny.
[01:40:30.650 --> 01:40:32.952]  But of the groups not awake across the board,
[01:40:33.672 --> 01:40:44.154]  There is just a servile, decadent mindlessness in society with folks that just do nothing but play on their iPads all day or watch television.
[01:40:44.714 --> 01:40:52.735]  And I can't imagine where this nation will be in the future if those types of people continue to dominate society.
[01:40:54.436 --> 01:40:57.816]  It's not a pretty picture that it conjures up.
[01:40:59.117 --> 01:41:01.677]  What we need, we've got to have people who
[01:41:02.739 --> 01:41:11.443]  Who understand the situation, who have courage in the backbone to protect what we have and to start turning it around.
[01:41:11.463 --> 01:41:14.824]  Because it's not going to happen.
[01:41:15.385 --> 01:41:18.826]  Liberty is not a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[01:41:19.286 --> 01:41:22.708]  We have to work at it constantly.
[01:41:22.808 --> 01:41:26.470]  Our founders understood that liberty is not guaranteed.
[01:41:26.890 --> 01:41:29.111]  We have to fight for it every single day.
[01:41:29.864 --> 01:41:31.105]  LibertyGuard.org.
[01:41:31.145 --> 01:41:32.366]  Bob Barr's got to go in just a minute.
[01:41:32.386 --> 01:41:33.868]  Let me ask you one final question.
[01:41:34.308 --> 01:41:41.574]  In your gut, not a prediction, but just a dead reckoning, do you think anyone will stand up against Obama in Congress?
[01:41:42.355 --> 01:41:44.176]  Will they let him do the blanket amnesty?
[01:41:44.256 --> 01:41:48.460]  Will they let him try to use executive power against the guns and claim the U.N.
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:49.261]  gives him authority?
[01:41:49.281 --> 01:41:51.423]  I mean, is there anything Obama
[01:41:53.337 --> 01:41:56.398]  We were talking during the break earlier about the race baiting.
[01:41:56.438 --> 01:41:59.599]  You said it's so incredibly obvious they don't even care.
[01:41:59.619 --> 01:42:03.200]  I mean, when I watch MSNBC, it is bizarro world.
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:04.561]  It is so transparent.
[01:42:05.321 --> 01:42:08.622]  They are clearly villains, exacerbating a problem.
[01:42:09.482 --> 01:42:12.804]  And now they're defending, rioting in Time Magazine?
[01:42:12.824 --> 01:42:16.647]  I mean, they're now beating people's brains out for no reason with hammers.
[01:42:17.227 --> 01:42:23.111]  Racial attacks, women being attacked at Papa John's, and the media is defending it.
[01:42:23.471 --> 01:42:25.733]  What is wrong with the establishment?
[01:42:27.343 --> 01:42:43.189]  What is wrong with the establishment is we have had now two and three generations of the constitutional dumbing down of this country and this notion that everybody is a victim, particularly if you're a person of color.
[01:42:44.150 --> 01:42:49.112]  Everybody's a victim and government will solve all of the problems for you.
[01:42:50.052 --> 01:42:51.193]  It's come home to roost.
[01:42:51.293 --> 01:42:52.213]  It's come a cropper.
[01:42:53.493 --> 01:42:54.614]  It didn't happen overnight.
[01:42:55.214 --> 01:43:21.788]  You know, just as one would yearn for the days if we had an Attorney General who was actually going to Ferguson to assist law enforcement, to denounce lawbreakers, to denounce rioters, and yet what we have is we have an Attorney General going around to churches talking about what we need to do within government to address these problems.
[01:43:22.588 --> 01:43:24.049]  Uh, of racial profiling.
[01:43:24.089 --> 01:43:36.573]  Racial profiling has nothing to do with what's going on in Ferguson, uh, other than from the standpoint of racial race baiting by Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson and so forth.
[01:43:37.213 --> 01:43:44.835]  And yet, uh, we have, uh, the entire institution of the federal government on the opposite side.
[01:43:45.315 --> 01:43:47.516]  This administration is not going to change.
[01:43:48.203 --> 01:43:53.588]  The leadership in the Congress does not appear ready, willing, and able to change.
[01:43:54.268 --> 01:43:57.972]  But ultimately, I still am optimistic.
[01:43:58.032 --> 01:43:59.153]  I think there are enough
[01:43:59.995 --> 01:44:10.543]  Good people, some of them new people in the House and the Senate, on the Republican side, that they will make sure that some things are done.
[01:44:10.563 --> 01:44:22.493]  I'm not overly optimistic, but I do believe that we are going to see enough people stand up so that we will start to turn this thing around.
[01:44:23.053 --> 01:44:28.935]  And there are cases where the police clearly do beat and shoot black people to death for no reason.
[01:44:28.955 --> 01:44:30.796]  And those are real cases.
[01:44:30.816 --> 01:44:32.317]  And a lot of times the police get indicted.
[01:44:33.037 --> 01:44:35.178]  There's also cases where they kill white people the same way.
[01:44:35.198 --> 01:44:41.961]  It's just this case is one of the worst ones to pick when all the evidence points towards Brown being a thug.
[01:44:42.321 --> 01:44:43.041]  I'm sad he's dead.
[01:44:43.061 --> 01:44:44.222]  We're going to talk about the case of Eric
[01:44:45.362 --> 01:44:46.822]  Bob Barr, thank you for the time.
[01:45:09.946 --> 01:45:11.567]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:45:11.627 --> 01:45:15.010]  LibertyGuard.org, and I look forward to being with you again in the near future.
[01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:15.390]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:15.410 --> 01:45:16.291]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[01:45:17.152 --> 01:45:22.416]  Well, there goes Bob Barr, and I want to talk about this case and then open the phones up.
[01:45:23.016 --> 01:45:35.225]  Eric Garter in Staten Island, because these are the kind of cases I see where whites, blacks, Hispanics, you name it, get killed by white cops, black cops, Hispanic cops.
[01:45:35.305 --> 01:45:35.906]  It's the training.
[01:45:36.914 --> 01:45:44.555]  And man, you know, four white guys just grabbed this black guy that isn't resisting, shoved him down on the ground and choked him to death.
[01:45:46.996 --> 01:45:50.056]  And I guess they must be big UFC fans, but they don't know what they're doing.
[01:45:50.976 --> 01:45:53.037]  And I just, it's just that image.
[01:45:53.077 --> 01:45:58.978]  And it's like the white state police in Oklahoma who pull over the black EMT who does nothing and they start choking him.
[01:45:58.998 --> 01:46:02.979]  And he controls himself and takes it and puts his hands at his side.
[01:46:03.919 --> 01:46:04.639]  And I just,
[01:46:06.568 --> 01:46:11.453]  It's bizarre, and you know, I get upset watching him kill this guy because he's a human being.
[01:46:12.494 --> 01:46:15.998]  And the cop's shoving his head full of power into the ground and just killing him!
[01:46:19.021 --> 01:46:22.965]  And there are a lot of wimp types that want to be cops.
[01:46:23.326 --> 01:46:28.892]  In the old days, the word was you didn't hire wimps because they would end up hurting people because they got something to prove.
[01:46:31.078 --> 01:46:38.120]  You rarely see cops that are really big or tough and you can, you know, former military or whatever just throwing their weight around starting fights.
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:46.282]  It is usually, not even so much little cops, but it's the cops that got something to prove.
[01:46:46.942 --> 01:46:50.483]  People that were a lot of times bullies in high school or whatever and they want that authority.
[01:46:51.203 --> 01:46:57.125]  And you can just see it instantly the way a cop's behaving, whether they're just trying to do their job or they're on a power trip.
[01:46:58.412 --> 01:46:59.512]  And I think it's manslaughter.
[01:46:59.532 --> 01:47:11.136]  We're going to play the audio and video of this, if you're a radio listener, Infowars.com forward slash show of a Staten Island police killing Eric Gardner.
[01:47:12.176 --> 01:47:14.057]  So let's go ahead and play that clip.
[01:47:15.657 --> 01:47:16.138]  And then we'll...
[01:47:30.329 --> 01:47:37.577]  I love how they shit on his head and his arm.
[01:47:37.597 --> 01:47:40.340]  Stop it right there, I can't even watch this.
[01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:41.461]  Just hold on, back it up a little bit.
[01:47:42.182 --> 01:47:44.744]  Here in Grownmen Bag, it's just like that other tape.
[01:47:45.728 --> 01:47:46.888]  Where they kill that white guy.
[01:47:47.208 --> 01:47:49.949]  It's just... You know, Kelly Thomas, they start begging.
[01:47:50.469 --> 01:47:52.090]  And the cops get real excited about it.
[01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:54.290]  Like wolves tearing a sheep apart.
[01:47:55.171 --> 01:47:59.392]  They put their knees on his arm because they want to hurt somebody.
[01:48:01.432 --> 01:48:02.933]  And then they say, put your arm behind your back.
[01:48:02.953 --> 01:48:04.553]  Just like the Kelly Thomas, they keep going.
[01:48:05.453 --> 01:48:08.654]  Put your hands behind your back as they're all sitting on him, beating his brains out.
[01:48:09.794 --> 01:48:11.055]  Just go ahead and play the rest of it.
[01:48:11.075 --> 01:48:11.415]  Here it is.
[01:48:14.063 --> 01:48:16.305]  Once again, police beating up on people.
[01:48:16.745 --> 01:48:18.806]  All he did was break up a fight.
[01:48:18.907 --> 01:48:21.848]  And this is what happens for breaking up a fight.
[01:48:22.769 --> 01:48:23.249]  It's crazy.
[01:48:46.482 --> 01:48:47.563]  And so this is going on.
[01:48:47.583 --> 01:48:48.604]  Can't breathe.
[01:48:48.644 --> 01:48:49.024]  Can't breathe.
[01:48:49.064 --> 01:48:49.264]  Killed him.
[01:48:49.284 --> 01:48:50.265]  Look, now they gave this man a seizure.
[01:48:50.285 --> 01:48:51.125]  Yo, move out the way!
[01:48:51.185 --> 01:48:53.067]  Even after he's seizured, they're going in to kill.
[01:48:53.087 --> 01:48:53.387]  Back it up!
[01:48:53.447 --> 01:48:53.747]  Back it up!
[01:48:53.767 --> 01:48:54.088]  Back it up!
[01:48:54.128 --> 01:48:54.748]  Back it up!
[01:48:54.788 --> 01:48:55.108]  Back it up!
[01:48:55.128 --> 01:48:55.428]  Back it up!
[01:48:55.449 --> 01:48:55.829]  Back it up!
[01:48:55.849 --> 01:48:56.269]  Back it up!
[01:48:56.289 --> 01:48:56.589]  Back it up!
[01:48:56.609 --> 01:48:56.850]  Back it up!
[01:48:56.890 --> 01:48:57.170]  Back it up!
[01:48:57.210 --> 01:48:57.530]  Back it up!
[01:48:57.550 --> 01:48:57.830]  Back it up!
[01:48:57.850 --> 01:48:58.211]  Back it up!
[01:48:58.231 --> 01:48:58.511]  Back it up!
[01:48:58.531 --> 01:48:58.831]  Back it up!
[01:48:58.851 --> 01:48:59.131]  Back it up!
[01:48:59.151 --> 01:48:59.391]  Back it up!
[01:48:59.411 --> 01:48:59.732]  Back it up!
[01:48:59.752 --> 01:49:00.052]  Back it up!
[01:49:00.072 --> 01:49:00.312]  Back it up!
[01:49:00.332 --> 01:49:00.772]  Back it up!
[01:49:00.812 --> 01:49:01.173]  Back it up!
[01:49:01.193 --> 01:49:01.473]  Back it up!
[01:49:01.493 --> 01:49:01.813]  Back it up!
[01:49:01.833 --> 01:49:02.133]  Back it up!
[01:49:02.153 --> 01:49:02.774]  Back it up!
[01:49:02.794 --> 01:49:03.014]  Back it up!
[01:49:03.034 --> 01:49:03.274]  Back it up!
[01:49:03.314 --> 01:49:03.554]  Back it up!
[01:49:03.574 --> 01:49:03.895]  Back it up!
[01:49:03.915 --> 01:49:04.255]  Back it up!
[01:49:04.315 --> 01:49:04.635]  Back it up!
[01:49:04.695 --> 01:49:05.196]  Back it up!
[01:49:05.216 --> 01:49:05.436]  Back it up!
[01:49:05.456 --> 01:49:05.696]  Back it up!
[01:49:05.716 --> 01:49:05.936]  Back it up!
[01:49:05.996 --> 01:49:06.256]  Back it up!
[01:49:06.276 --> 01:49:06.557]  Back it up!
[01:49:06.577 --> 01:49:07.517]  Back it up!
[01:49:07.537 --> 01:49:07.857]  Back it up!
[01:49:07.898 --> 01:49:08.218]  Back it up!
[01:49:08.258 --> 01:49:08.618]  Back it up!
[01:49:09.679 --> 01:49:09.859]  Back
[01:49:16.203 --> 01:49:19.548]  And they're talking about riots and stuff if the police don't get indicted on this one.
[01:49:20.129 --> 01:49:21.451]  And I think it's manslaughter.
[01:49:23.214 --> 01:49:27.079]  I mean, yeah, I think they should indict the ones that did it for manslaughter, and then they'll think next time.
[01:49:27.340 --> 01:49:29.143]  Or, hey, you don't want to be put in that position.
[01:49:29.183 --> 01:49:29.904]  You want to be immune?
[01:49:29.944 --> 01:49:30.525]  Don't be a cop.
[01:49:33.536 --> 01:49:38.300]  But, you want to kill somebody, then you need to face the consequences.
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:41.522]  That means the black race is beating white people's heads in with hammers.
[01:49:41.922 --> 01:49:43.764]  They need to get blown away.
[01:49:43.784 --> 01:49:46.405]  If you run to me with a hammer, I'm going to pull a gun out and shoot you.
[01:49:46.425 --> 01:49:47.947]  I'm not going to play games.
[01:49:48.827 --> 01:49:49.888]  And it's the same thing.
[01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:51.729]  Shoot at firefighters.
[01:49:51.749 --> 01:49:52.570]  You need to get shot.
[01:49:55.332 --> 01:49:58.674]  But just because you're in a gang of police doesn't mean you get to kill people either.
[01:49:58.954 --> 01:50:02.257]  It's this gang mob psychology that we're dealing with.
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:04.581]  I'm very upset.
[01:50:05.161 --> 01:50:19.270]  But what they're doing is they're taking real concern about this and projecting it onto Brown to cause an explosion to then end up causing a distraction from what the globalists are doing in the big picture.
[01:50:20.571 --> 01:50:26.294]  And then Obama gets to sit up there and act like he's concerned about police brutality and, oh, that's what he's doing for the community.
[01:50:26.334 --> 01:50:26.995]  He's giving back.
[01:50:28.325 --> 01:50:29.606]  He's sticking with the hood.
[01:50:29.906 --> 01:50:31.047]  He's sticking with the brothers.
[01:50:31.528 --> 01:50:32.208]  Give me a break.
[01:50:32.328 --> 01:50:37.353]  Obama has got Al-Qaeda forces murdering every black person they can find in Libya.
[01:50:37.993 --> 01:50:40.936]  He's got them murdering non-radical Muslims everywhere.
[01:50:41.136 --> 01:50:42.177]  Hundreds of thousands of people.
[01:50:42.517 --> 01:50:43.698]  It's a murder machine.
[01:50:44.339 --> 01:50:46.841]  Planned Parenthood, though, stands with Brown.
[01:50:47.822 --> 01:50:51.225]  Oh, because they're upset they couldn't kill him when he was in his mommy.
[01:50:52.444 --> 01:50:55.646]  It's just a total sick joke.
[01:50:55.666 --> 01:51:01.349]  And having race war on white people isn't going to stop police being given this type of training.
[01:51:02.130 --> 01:51:05.832]  The issue is the federal training that turned them into killing machines.
[01:51:10.071 --> 01:51:12.972]  This hour brought to you by InfidelBodyArmor.com.

[01:52:09.235 --> 01:52:14.077]  Did you know by age 50, half of all men have an enlarged prostate?
[01:52:14.538 --> 01:52:20.941]  This means more urges to urinate, longer bathroom trips, waking at night to urinate, or issues with sex.

[01:52:58.604 --> 01:52:59.145]  Don't wait.
[01:52:59.545 --> 01:53:00.205]  Just call 1-800-852-1820.
[01:53:00.266 --> 01:53:00.466]  That's 1-800-852-1820.
[01:53:00.546 --> 01:53:00.746]  Call 1-800-852-1820.
[01:53:09.012 --> 01:53:10.734]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[01:53:10.934 --> 01:53:14.257]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[01:53:14.577 --> 01:53:15.558]  A pair of scissors.
[01:53:15.938 --> 01:53:21.422]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for them.
[01:53:21.723 --> 01:53:26.387]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[01:53:26.647 --> 01:53:27.467]  The phone line.
[01:53:27.628 --> 01:53:32.552]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[01:53:32.892 --> 01:53:36.635]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[01:53:36.775 --> 01:53:39.678]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[01:53:40.099 --> 01:53:42.341]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.
[01:53:42.562 --> 01:53:46.767]  Built by Harvard engineers, SimpliSafe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.

[01:54:10.119 --> 01:54:21.942]  So Eric Garner was choked to death for no reason.
[01:54:23.707 --> 01:54:25.749]  And who knows if the people that did it will get in any trouble.
[01:54:26.649 --> 01:54:39.878]  Because the police should not be above the law, and there is a lot of problems, but that's driven by the very same social engineers that now want to blame all of the political problems we have on the police solely.
[01:54:41.599 --> 01:54:49.585]  As counties, as cities, as societies, you shouldn't put up with the type of tactics that have come into quote law enforcement.
[01:54:49.925 --> 01:54:52.447]  We need peace officers, not
[01:54:54.128 --> 01:54:59.971]  Soldiers who are big UFC fans who want to see how many people they can kill.
[01:55:02.372 --> 01:55:04.213]  Now, we're going to open the phones up in the next hour.
[01:55:04.413 --> 01:55:06.334]  I want to talk to first-time callers today.
[01:55:06.634 --> 01:55:08.635]  Haven't done that in four or five shows.
[01:55:09.335 --> 01:55:14.097]  I'd like to get your take on what is obviously incredible race baiting by the White House.
[01:55:14.537 --> 01:55:15.518]  What is their endgame?
[01:55:15.558 --> 01:55:21.881]  Well, it's to get riots going nationwide and then have the UN call for gun control, which has now happened today.
[01:55:23.527 --> 01:55:27.351]  That story is on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:55:27.531 --> 01:55:27.732]  U.N.
[01:55:27.792 --> 01:55:28.673]  attacks, U.S.
[01:55:29.033 --> 01:55:30.114]  gun rights, and more.
[01:55:31.516 --> 01:55:33.938]  Citing Ferguson police.
[01:55:36.681 --> 01:55:39.324]  So that's the headline on InfoWars.com.
[01:55:39.424 --> 01:55:44.249]  Also, judge issues temporary ban on arrest for feeding the homeless.
[01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:48.002]  MSNBC guest says USA founded on racism.
[01:55:48.342 --> 01:55:50.723]  Ferguson riots caused by white supremacy.
[01:55:51.323 --> 01:55:56.226]  New York prepares for riots as grand jury weighs Eric Garner decision.
[01:55:56.666 --> 01:55:57.787]  Kurt Nemo story.
[01:55:58.867 --> 01:56:01.109]  And there's a new club of Reverend Farrakhan saying...
[01:56:02.349 --> 01:56:05.492]  The blacks need to stop dying for nothing and start dying for something.
[01:56:05.552 --> 01:56:08.834]  I mean, he's really trying to, I guess, get a race war going.
[01:56:09.955 --> 01:56:11.797]  Maybe Farrakhan really thinks that'll happen.
[01:56:12.438 --> 01:56:17.402]  But I mean, it'll just be random whites in their car coming home from work and their head beating with a hammer, who've done nothing.
[01:56:19.778 --> 01:56:26.506]  Ferguson Police Chief, a lot of discussion about charging Brown's stepfather with inciting a riot.
[01:56:26.947 --> 01:56:28.028]  Well, what's Farrakhan doing?
[01:56:28.589 --> 01:56:33.435]  Islamic State says bomb expert threatens London with dubious dirty bomb.
[01:56:34.276 --> 01:56:35.337]  I'm gonna break that down.
[01:56:35.458 --> 01:56:38.421]  Family demands hate crime charges for murderers of
[01:56:39.648 --> 01:56:45.491]  Zimrik Bejik, the Bosnian immigrant killed in a hammer attack by St.
[01:56:45.531 --> 01:56:49.932]  Louis black teens, heard screaming, kill the white people.
[01:56:51.773 --> 01:57:04.999]  And without a hint of irony, Planned Parenthood joins the hashtag Black Lives Matter protest, when their main founding mission is to kill black people before they ever get out of the womb.
[01:57:06.531 --> 01:57:08.511]  So sad how this manipulation is happening.
[01:57:08.571 --> 01:57:09.432]  Full court press.
[01:57:09.592 --> 01:57:10.252]  NFL.
[01:57:11.752 --> 01:57:12.332]  Congress.
[01:57:13.112 --> 01:57:14.553]  The new thing is hold your hands up.
[01:57:15.973 --> 01:57:19.314]  Should whites walk around with a hammer in their hand and go up to blacks and say don't kill me bro?
[01:57:19.754 --> 01:57:20.134]  Well no!
[01:57:20.374 --> 01:57:23.375]  You can't blame black people for what racist blacks do.
[01:57:23.735 --> 01:57:26.355]  Anymore than you can hold your hands up and be the victim.
[01:57:26.375 --> 01:57:28.796]  It just gets so old.
[01:57:29.536 --> 01:57:31.836]  Now before we go any further, I keep doing this at the end of the hour.
[01:57:31.856 --> 01:57:33.477]  I should be announcing this every segment.
[01:57:33.517 --> 01:57:34.177]  It's so important.

[01:59:00.106 --> 01:59:01.327]  Another major health threat.
[01:59:01.367 --> 01:59:06.269]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:59:06.349 --> 01:59:08.970]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:59:09.010 --> 01:59:15.792]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:59:16.053 --> 01:59:18.914]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:59:19.034 --> 01:59:21.975]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:59:21.995 --> 01:59:23.996]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:59:24.016 --> 01:59:26.857]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:59:26.937 --> 01:59:32.439]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:59:32.659 --> 01:59:36.160]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:59:36.180 --> 01:59:39.161]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:59:39.181 --> 01:59:46.363]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[01:59:56.827 --> 01:59:57.908]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:15.902 --> 02:00:20.084]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:20.745 --> 02:00:21.545]  You want answers?
[02:00:22.326 --> 02:00:23.246]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.867 --> 02:00:27.469]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:28.049 --> 02:00:32.112]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:39.835 --> 02:00:46.479]  All right, I want to take 30 minutes of calls, intensely, and then I want to get into a bunch of news on other economic issues and things I haven't hit.
[02:00:46.499 --> 02:00:47.759]  I've got to get to all this other news.
[02:00:48.179 --> 02:00:49.100]  Lisa mentioned some of it.
[02:00:50.060 --> 02:00:53.742]  But I want to talk to first-time callers here today about, again, what is your line in the sand?
[02:00:54.722 --> 02:00:56.263]  What do you think about the incredible race baiting?
[02:00:56.303 --> 02:00:57.424]  What are the globalists planning?
[02:00:58.922 --> 02:01:02.984]  Do you think Obama's going to be held accountable for all his executive power-grabbing, the open borders?
[02:01:03.004 --> 02:01:06.326]  I mean, this is bizarro world, as Bob Barr said earlier.
[02:01:06.346 --> 02:01:08.947]  The toll-free number is 800-259-9231.
[02:01:09.007 --> 02:01:14.110]  But you can bring up any subjects you want.
[02:01:14.150 --> 02:01:18.632]  I mean, we've got other crazy stories that are so important, like subconscious ordering.
[02:01:18.972 --> 02:01:24.595]  New Pizza Hut menu scans retinas, basically reads your mind to take the order.
[02:01:26.055 --> 02:01:28.236]  This is big, and I'm going to break it down coming up.
[02:01:28.756 --> 02:01:32.017]  Just like Amazon says they'll take your order before you order it.
[02:01:32.037 --> 02:01:34.658]  We're going to explain what that really means, or I'll give you my take.
[02:01:35.598 --> 02:01:36.378]  Also, U.S.
[02:01:36.438 --> 02:01:38.679]  Ebola vaccine, clear safety test.
[02:01:38.979 --> 02:01:42.880]  Oh, if you believe that, I got a bridge I'm happy to sell you.
[02:01:43.761 --> 02:01:47.362]  Falling oil prices could cripple vulnerable Russia, trigger World War III.
[02:01:48.002 --> 02:01:50.223]  That's just some of the news that's coming up.
[02:01:51.063 --> 02:01:53.804]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to Keith in Indiana.
[02:01:53.844 --> 02:01:54.444]  You're on the air.
[02:01:57.125 --> 02:01:58.005]  Alex, how you doing?
[02:01:58.165 --> 02:01:58.566]  Good, brother.
[02:02:00.666 --> 02:02:20.013]  Yeah, my line in the sand was drawn a long time ago when they started to attack my family and my loved ones through poisonous food and other products that are out there every single day that everybody takes and they don't realize that it's totally killing them.
[02:02:20.493 --> 02:02:22.753]  We've consolidated our family.
[02:02:22.773 --> 02:02:23.494]  We're
[02:02:25.069 --> 02:02:36.197]  We have multiple acres on one mortgage, and there's six incomes that are working on one mortgage, and we're freeing ourselves through the love of our family.
[02:02:36.217 --> 02:02:42.421]  I wanted to give you one anecdotal incident that happened to me when I was a child, when I was in eighth grade.
[02:02:42.441 --> 02:02:51.648]  I had never been vaccinated, and in school they brought me to the principal's office with all the principals and the head nurse, and they asked me,
[02:02:52.381 --> 02:02:58.295]  Well, I haven't been vaccinated and I was prompted by my parents to say it's a religious objection.
[02:02:58.515 --> 02:03:00.119]  That's the one thing that they cannot...
[02:03:03.876 --> 02:03:12.198]  But notice they all called you in like you've done something wrong with peer pressure when there's not even a law.
[02:03:12.838 --> 02:03:20.000]  There's just a policy that they say you need to get an exemption for to create the illusion of a crime being committed.
[02:03:20.420 --> 02:03:25.322]  They'll even kick you out of school fraudulently and then trigger truancy charges that are thrown out.
[02:03:26.477 --> 02:03:31.279]  If you know your rights, but it shows the collective criminal fraud going on.
[02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:36.582]  There is a conscientious objector, there's a medical exemption, and there's a religious exemption.
[02:03:36.842 --> 02:03:39.404]  But they're exemptions to a non-law.
[02:03:39.424 --> 02:03:40.084]  Do you understand that?
[02:03:41.087 --> 02:03:42.748]  I absolutely understand that.
[02:03:42.868 --> 02:03:45.210]  It's our only defense right now.
[02:03:45.230 --> 02:03:48.172]  I tell people every single day, it is not the law.
[02:03:48.393 --> 02:03:49.193]  People come to me.
[02:03:49.634 --> 02:03:53.877]  They come to me and say, I don't know if I want to vaccinate my child or not.
[02:03:53.937 --> 02:03:57.219]  I'm afraid that I won't be able to go into public school because it's against the law.
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:00.402]  The first thing I tell them, I say, it is not against the law.
[02:04:01.042 --> 02:04:02.063]  It's not against the law.
[02:04:02.083 --> 02:04:04.044]  But see, this shows how the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[02:04:04.064 --> 02:04:05.586]  Now they can keep a fraud going.
[02:04:06.426 --> 02:04:16.018]  And the school knows they're involved in a fraud because federal funds and state funds are tied, more than test scores, they're tied to vaccination.
[02:04:16.278 --> 02:04:19.662]  Because vaccination is the big conspiracy.
[02:04:19.682 --> 02:04:20.764]  So finish the story.
[02:04:20.784 --> 02:04:24.088]  I mean, the principal, the nurse, they're there.
[02:04:24.128 --> 02:04:24.789]  What'd they say to you?
[02:04:25.746 --> 02:04:26.927]  So how did it end?
[02:04:26.947 --> 02:04:27.667]  How did it end?
[02:04:46.127 --> 02:04:47.768]  Well, sorry, I mean it's beyond that.
[02:04:48.148 --> 02:04:50.710]  But, you know, that is a whole smart thing to do, is what the illegals do.
[02:04:50.730 --> 02:05:04.297]  Of course, then they don't pay taxes and are by the law, but get a bunch of folks together on a property, like family used to do, and have grandparents, everybody there, neighbors, cousins, and then pool your resources and live like kings, and start a black market.
[02:05:04.498 --> 02:05:05.458]  I mean, that's the way to go now.
[02:05:05.478 --> 02:05:06.819]  It's the only way to survive for many people.
[02:05:07.259 --> 02:05:07.819]  We'll be back.
[02:05:10.174 --> 02:05:13.675]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:05:13.815 --> 02:05:17.776]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:18.096 --> 02:05:19.556]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:05:19.876 --> 02:05:27.458]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:05:27.738 --> 02:05:28.578]  But for how long?

[02:06:10.054 --> 02:06:11.274]  Another major health threat.
[02:06:11.294 --> 02:06:16.196]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:06:16.276 --> 02:06:18.917]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:06:18.957 --> 02:06:25.739]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:06:25.999 --> 02:06:28.860]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:06:28.980 --> 02:06:31.941]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:06:32.021 --> 02:06:33.942]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:06:33.962 --> 02:06:36.803]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:06:36.903 --> 02:06:42.386]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:06:42.606 --> 02:06:46.108]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:06:46.128 --> 02:06:49.109]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:06:49.229 --> 02:06:56.313]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[02:07:09.740 --> 02:07:11.402]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[02:07:11.722 --> 02:07:15.504]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:07:16.265 --> 02:07:20.588]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[02:07:20.728 --> 02:07:25.391]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth.
[02:07:25.851 --> 02:07:27.493]  Nerve growth and rejuvenation.
[02:07:28.013 --> 02:07:37.142]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:07:37.322 --> 02:07:39.264]  We now have the synergistic solution.
[02:07:39.504 --> 02:07:42.788]  DNA force, just one of the key compounds.
[02:07:42.868 --> 02:07:46.171]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:07:46.511 --> 02:07:50.112]  And over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.

[02:08:18.092 --> 02:08:25.816]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:34.420 --> 02:08:36.581]  The wagers of sin are death.
[02:08:38.082 --> 02:08:40.583]  And our country's become pretty darn corrupt.
[02:08:41.443 --> 02:08:47.146]  And so like opening a portal on a submarine, the water of tyranny is pouring in.
[02:08:49.232 --> 02:08:51.655]  We're opening the phones up for any issue you want to discuss.
[02:08:51.695 --> 02:08:55.339]  First Time Callers 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 The White House, the media, they're all betting on hyping the Brown shooting.
[02:09:07.842 --> 02:09:10.603]  And they're legitimizing rioting and racial attacks.
[02:09:11.344 --> 02:09:19.007]  I guess believing turning the American people against each other will distract us while the globalists rob us seven ways to Sunday.
[02:09:20.087 --> 02:09:22.188]  UN has now attacked U.S.
[02:09:22.368 --> 02:09:24.349]  gun rights and more, citing Ferguson.
[02:09:25.629 --> 02:09:27.630]  Says they have their new UN treaty to go after us.
[02:09:27.670 --> 02:09:31.372]  This is Detroit's entire electrical grid basically goes down.
[02:09:33.595 --> 02:09:35.075]  That's some of the news I've already hit.
[02:09:35.115 --> 02:09:41.257]  There is a ton of news that I have not gotten to yet that I will be covering on a host of issues.
[02:09:43.177 --> 02:09:45.438]  The situation with Russia is intensifying.
[02:09:46.418 --> 02:09:52.079]  FEMA kept a close eye on Ferguson during August protest when it was first going on.
[02:09:52.499 --> 02:09:53.880]  That's just some of what's coming up.
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:10:01.302]  But I wanted to play the first Lewis Farrakhan clip because there's a new clip in a story we have on Infowars.com
[02:10:04.028 --> 02:10:09.830]  With the latest comments by Farrakhan, some of the most radical he's ever issued.
[02:10:10.290 --> 02:10:13.811]  Let's go ahead and go to that first clip from last week.
[02:10:13.951 --> 02:10:27.835]  Now as long as they kill us and go to Wendy's and have a burger and go to sleep, they're going to keep killing us.
[02:10:27.875 --> 02:10:30.116]  But when we die and they die,
[02:10:34.008 --> 02:10:42.210]  Then soon, we're gonna sit at a table and talk about retirement!
[02:10:43.250 --> 02:10:44.970]  We want some of this earth!
[02:10:47.351 --> 02:10:53.132]  Or we'll tear this damn country up!
[02:10:54.412 --> 02:10:56.592]  As-salamu alaykum!
[02:10:56.632 --> 02:11:00.113]  I mean, do you think the insurance companies care if some stuff gets torn up?
[02:11:03.095 --> 02:11:13.578]  Obama, with the Republicans, with the insurance companies, wrote Obamacare to rob every poor person in America and fleece the rest of the middle class and set up death panels, for heaven's sakes.
[02:11:15.759 --> 02:11:17.980]  I mean, come on, Farrakhan, let's hear you talk about abortion.
[02:11:18.620 --> 02:11:21.561]  Let's hear you talk about what's in the GMO crops.
[02:11:21.601 --> 02:11:22.421]  I know you do some.
[02:11:23.161 --> 02:11:27.863]  Let's hear you get into real issues that are silent, creeping death for everybody.
[02:11:28.752 --> 02:11:29.773]  Fluoridation of water.
[02:11:30.553 --> 02:11:39.497]  I know the Final Call newspaper, I've read it before, has even quoted some of our reports.
[02:11:40.398 --> 02:11:44.740]  I mean, that's good stuff to strengthen the black community or any other community.
[02:11:45.340 --> 02:11:53.124]  But what Farrakhan's doing now, just randomly saying, you know, if whites die, this will stop happening.
[02:11:53.144 --> 02:11:53.684]  No, it won't.
[02:11:54.725 --> 02:11:56.926]  It'll kick off a race war and a bunch of people will die.
[02:11:57.938 --> 02:11:59.579]  And create racism and division.
[02:12:00.259 --> 02:12:07.982]  But I know, originally Nation of Islam was black only, and wanted its own country, and that's still there, that separatist idea.
[02:12:08.042 --> 02:12:11.323]  That's why a lot of the white supremacist groups like the Nation of Islam.
[02:12:12.503 --> 02:12:15.284]  Because they're like, yes, whites need to be separate, and blacks need to be separate.
[02:12:15.764 --> 02:12:18.866]  Look, people can do whatever they want, in their own lives, okay?
[02:12:18.886 --> 02:12:19.626]  I support freedom.
[02:12:21.525 --> 02:12:26.310]  But I don't want black people to be hurt, and I don't want white people to be hurt.
[02:12:26.750 --> 02:12:29.994]  Besides, most people in this country aren't even one thing or the other anymore.
[02:12:31.675 --> 02:12:33.537]  It's just pure manipulation.
[02:12:34.418 --> 02:12:37.682]  And I guess it's easy for Farrakhan's base to get up there and talk like that.
[02:12:38.522 --> 02:12:40.484]  But there's a new clip out from Farrakhan now.
[02:12:40.925 --> 02:12:42.126]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[02:12:43.287 --> 02:12:44.609]  You may not want to fight.
[02:12:51.144 --> 02:12:53.385]  But you better get ready.
[02:12:55.026 --> 02:13:02.971]  Teach your baby how to throw the bottle if they can't bite.
[02:13:14.197 --> 02:13:15.478]  We're going to die anyway.
[02:13:23.616 --> 02:13:24.857]  Let's die for something.
[02:13:26.197 --> 02:13:28.519]  Guys, will you find it where Farrakhan talks about me?
[02:13:30.299 --> 02:13:39.724]  In one of those clips, he's talked about me a couple times, it's just, it's something like, Lewis Farrakhan talks about Alex Jones, and he gets real excited.
[02:13:39.964 --> 02:13:42.466]  Maybe he's not a plant, maybe he really thinks violence is good.
[02:13:42.806 --> 02:13:46.288]  He gets real excited when I blow up at Piers Morgan and say,
[02:13:47.390 --> 02:13:50.513]  If you try to take our firearms, 1776 will commence again.
[02:13:50.553 --> 02:13:51.653]  Well, that's how it started to begin with.
[02:13:51.994 --> 02:13:53.435]  And it will be a civil war then.
[02:13:53.815 --> 02:14:05.464]  Any cop carrying out orders to disarm the public in a general disarmament is unconstitutional, is an act of domination, and people can legitimately resist that, and the police aren't stupid, they're not going to try it.
[02:14:06.225 --> 02:14:10.128]  They got federal squads trying in California right now, but I don't count that as the U.S.
[02:14:10.528 --> 02:14:11.609]  It isn't going to fly.
[02:14:14.747 --> 02:14:21.549]  And I mean, I wonder if Farrakhan's got cancer again or something, or... Because he looks crazy when he's talking about everybody's gonna die anyways.
[02:14:22.410 --> 02:14:24.150]  And he gets that crazy look in his eye.
[02:14:24.170 --> 02:14:26.551]  Is he about to start passing Kool-Aid out or something?
[02:14:27.732 --> 02:14:36.655]  I mean, do you have any idea what would happen if inner-city people, period, poor whites, blacks, Hispanics, whatever, tried to go out and attack rural areas?
[02:14:37.847 --> 02:14:41.429]  I mean, do you have any idea how trained with guns are people are in rural areas?
[02:14:41.789 --> 02:14:42.990]  And how many guns there are?
[02:14:43.010 --> 02:14:48.173]  I mean, do you really, Farrakhan, think white people in the countryside are scared?
[02:14:50.674 --> 02:14:52.375]  If the feds come, they're ready to kill.
[02:14:52.875 --> 02:14:54.897]  If a mob of black people come, they're ready to kill.
[02:14:55.137 --> 02:14:56.437]  They don't care what color you are.
[02:14:56.598 --> 02:14:57.838]  They're not looking for trouble either.
[02:14:58.979 --> 02:15:04.222]  I mean, that's the most ridiculous asinine statement about a race war with white people.
[02:15:07.873 --> 02:15:10.296]  All you're going to have is the police mowing black people down.
[02:15:10.576 --> 02:15:12.678]  They are going to let this thing get out of hand.
[02:15:13.118 --> 02:15:23.829]  I'm telling you, they may actually pull the trigger on this and start a big stinking race war that is completely pointless for the people, but works like a charm for the establishment.
[02:15:23.849 --> 02:15:25.291]  And then afterwards, they'll bring the UN in.
[02:15:26.539 --> 02:15:27.199]  And restore order.
[02:15:27.219 --> 02:15:31.261]  This is how they have their communist revolution and they kick it off with race riots in America.
[02:15:31.721 --> 02:15:35.883]  And they use the disdain for, in many cases, the out of control police.
[02:15:36.144 --> 02:15:40.626]  You know, what about the white homeless unarmed man in Albuquerque earlier this year?
[02:15:44.067 --> 02:15:44.768]  I forget his name.
[02:15:46.246 --> 02:15:47.407]  Maybe you guys print me an article on it.
[02:15:47.847 --> 02:15:49.488]  We've played the video probably 20 times here.
[02:15:50.068 --> 02:15:52.529]  And the cops are shooting him going, boo yeah, alright, yeah!
[02:15:52.549 --> 02:15:56.492]  And then they shoot him some more and say, don't, you know, don't resist, as he's dead.
[02:15:57.392 --> 02:15:58.373]  Like that makes it okay.
[02:15:58.433 --> 02:15:59.153]  Don't resist!
[02:16:00.594 --> 02:16:05.016]  It'd be like going to a gravesite and shooting the, shooting the ground and going, don't resist me!
[02:16:05.757 --> 02:16:06.497]  You're resisting me!
[02:16:06.517 --> 02:16:07.057]  You were buried in 1875!
[02:16:07.237 --> 02:16:09.739]  Boom, boom, boom, don't resist me!
[02:16:10.486 --> 02:16:12.267]  And they let the dog come over and bite on him.
[02:16:12.547 --> 02:16:14.868]  Video shows Albuquerque police killing homeless man.
[02:16:15.568 --> 02:16:16.829]  Just one more in a long line.
[02:16:17.489 --> 02:16:18.609]  James Boyd.
[02:16:18.990 --> 02:16:20.230]  Where is Louis Farrakhan here?
[02:16:20.250 --> 02:16:25.432]  Let me tell you, if there was video like this, of them shooting a black homeless guy, I'd be up in arms.
[02:16:26.553 --> 02:16:30.494]  I mean, I just don't... All those cops should be indicted, and they haven't been.
[02:16:30.895 --> 02:16:38.758]  And then we get the squad car video of the leader cop who got fired off the state police, driving up on his squad car, talking to his buddies on the radio,
[02:16:40.063 --> 02:16:43.325]  Knowing I can't wait to blow this guy's bleepers off.
[02:16:43.785 --> 02:16:44.705]  I'm gonna kill him.
[02:16:46.566 --> 02:16:48.807]  And they come over and they go, why?
[02:16:50.408 --> 02:16:53.990]  Just, just, just, I can't wait to kill somebody!
[02:16:54.210 --> 02:16:55.630]  And that's what, a Hispanic cop?
[02:16:56.711 --> 02:16:58.071]  Wants to kill a homeless guy?
[02:16:58.091 --> 02:16:59.432]  I don't think he wanted to kill him because he was white.
[02:16:59.772 --> 02:17:00.613]  He just was crazy!
[02:17:00.953 --> 02:17:04.554]  It's like the cops we see all the time every week walking into convenience stores.
[02:17:04.575 --> 02:17:07.556]  They'll just pull a gun out and put it in somebody's head just to scare the hell out of them.
[02:17:11.118 --> 02:17:15.203]  I'm going to shoot him in the bleeper, says cop, before executing camper.
[02:17:16.465 --> 02:17:23.674]  An Albuquerque police officer who killed a mentally ill homeless man last March expressed his desire to shoot him in the genitalia.
[02:17:24.074 --> 02:17:25.376]  New dash cam footage reveals.
[02:17:25.396 --> 02:17:25.957]  Let's scroll down.
[02:17:27.551 --> 02:17:28.652]  Then the article goes through it all.
[02:17:29.373 --> 02:17:42.705]  The video, obtained by KOB4 News, details a conversation between APD officer Keith Sandy and another, okay, one of the guys was Hispanic, I forget, I guess he's white, officer, right before the fatal shooting of James Boyd.
[02:17:43.185 --> 02:17:52.094]  During the confrontation, Sandy can be heard discussing his desire to shoot Boyd, who he refers to as a effing lunatic, in the bleeping with a shotgun.
[02:17:52.694 --> 02:17:53.315]  And he got to.
[02:17:56.314 --> 02:17:56.574]  I don't know.
[02:18:17.346 --> 02:18:24.908]  Starry-eyed in that last video clip, you can't see it on radio, it's on Infowars.com, when he goes, "'Cause we're all gonna, we're all gonna die."
[02:18:25.348 --> 02:18:26.509]  And he looks crazy.
[02:18:27.249 --> 02:18:27.949]  Let's go to the clip.
[02:18:29.469 --> 02:18:38.412]  And I saw a Mr. Alex Jones on television recently with Piers Morgan of CNN.
[02:18:41.513 --> 02:18:44.614]  And he said, before we allow you
[02:18:45.984 --> 02:18:48.367]  To take our guns from us!
[02:18:48.387 --> 02:18:51.310]  1776 will play out again.
[02:18:57.290 --> 02:19:02.491]  We intend to return America not to a democracy.
[02:19:02.811 --> 02:19:05.592]  You are lying to the American people.
[02:19:05.832 --> 02:19:08.512]  You're robbing them of democracy.
[02:19:08.832 --> 02:19:10.753]  This is not a democracy.
[02:19:11.053 --> 02:19:16.614]  This is an oligarchy that is leading America into fascism.
[02:19:17.934 --> 02:19:18.474]  Yes.
[02:19:19.234 --> 02:19:19.674]  That's enough.
[02:19:19.694 --> 02:19:20.834]  He goes on and on.
[02:19:21.375 --> 02:19:23.415]  I mean, it's just what is going on here?
[02:19:25.131 --> 02:19:27.993]  Louis Farrakhan has like 10 million followers, it's estimated.
[02:19:29.033 --> 02:19:34.896]  And he's talking about, go out and kill the white people, and then they will stop killing us.
[02:19:35.076 --> 02:19:36.317]  I don't want to kill anybody!
[02:19:40.619 --> 02:19:42.640]  And he's being allowed to do it.
[02:19:43.821 --> 02:19:51.745]  I mean, I made vague comments about resisting the government back in the mid-90s, and they had groups of people beat me up.
[02:19:52.346 --> 02:19:52.886]  I fought back.
[02:19:55.243 --> 02:19:59.789]  FBI following me around, questioning me, everything else.
[02:19:59.809 --> 02:20:02.191]  And I was like, I didn't mean I'm going to get violent.
[02:20:02.532 --> 02:20:07.798]  But I mean, believe me, folks, you start getting into stuff and you have a following, the system shows up.
[02:20:08.239 --> 02:20:09.000]  Not with Farrakhan.

[02:20:39.634 --> 02:20:41.475]  Mom, I can't do my math homework.
[02:20:41.675 --> 02:20:42.736]  I just don't get it.
[02:20:43.096 --> 02:20:43.996]  I hate math.
[02:20:44.577 --> 02:20:48.699]  I've always tried to be a good mother, but when it came to Jamie's math, I was at a loss.
[02:20:48.959 --> 02:20:51.580]  Then a friend told me about Math Made Easy DVDs.

[02:22:09.051 --> 02:22:10.772]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[02:22:10.992 --> 02:22:14.314]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[02:22:14.634 --> 02:22:15.595]  A pair of scissors.
[02:22:15.975 --> 02:22:21.478]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for them.
[02:22:21.758 --> 02:22:26.440]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[02:22:26.701 --> 02:22:27.501]  The phone line.
[02:22:27.681 --> 02:22:32.604]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[02:22:32.924 --> 02:22:36.666]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[02:22:36.826 --> 02:22:39.729]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[02:22:40.149 --> 02:22:42.412]  SimpliSafe Home Security is the smarter choice.

[02:23:09.417 --> 02:23:14.502]  The lining of your lungs is supposed to be protected with glutathione to neutralize incoming irritants.
[02:23:14.782 --> 02:23:18.485]  In the absence of enough glutathione, your lungs are more prone to irritation.
[02:23:18.645 --> 02:23:23.770]  Listen to the real-world results of one man using a powerful glutathione-supporting food.
[02:23:23.790 --> 02:23:25.272]  Hi, my name is Bill O'Brien.
[02:23:25.692 --> 02:23:28.454]  I generally suffer through an asthmatic breathing type situation.
[02:23:29.155 --> 02:23:32.018]  My breathing is shallow and generally constricted in the nose and lungs.
[02:23:32.699 --> 02:23:37.926]  After consuming one world away today, I have tremendous energy and also notice my breathing is free.
[02:23:38.687 --> 02:23:42.272]  I can feel the air in my left nostril and it is free all the way to my abdomen.
[02:23:42.652 --> 02:23:45.056]  Which is pretty remarkable because I rarely get that feeling.
[02:23:45.697 --> 02:23:48.080]  Being a singer, I love feeling this unrestricted voice.
[02:23:48.780 --> 02:23:51.983]  The only thing new I've actually added to my routine is One World Way.
[02:23:52.583 --> 02:23:52.863]  Wow!

[02:24:01.910 --> 02:24:05.033]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[02:24:10.957 --> 02:24:13.700]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:24:13.720 --> 02:24:17.563]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.

[02:25:04.380 --> 02:25:05.561]  It's a great activist tool.

[02:25:10.424 --> 02:25:13.866]  It's helping fund true 21st century liberty-based media.
[02:25:14.266 --> 02:25:15.687]  Let's go to Ramon in Texas.
[02:25:15.707 --> 02:25:16.948]  Thanks for holding your on the air.
[02:25:18.749 --> 02:25:19.589]  You bet, you bet.
[02:25:19.609 --> 02:25:24.712]  Hey, Alex, I guess I should call you governor because I voted for you.
[02:25:26.373 --> 02:25:27.834]  What, did you vote for me in the election?
[02:25:28.854 --> 02:25:35.698]  Yeah, where you have the ability to just fill it in with a name, I put your name in there.
[02:25:37.208 --> 02:25:38.129]  Wow, that's interesting.
[02:25:38.149 --> 02:25:39.150]  I wonder what that does.
[02:25:39.170 --> 02:25:45.876]  I don't know, but if enough people did it, maybe they'd have to make a news story out of it or something.
[02:25:46.476 --> 02:25:52.441]  Well, instead they've got news stories in Texas Monthly that I'm the long dead Bill Hicks, so we're in a lot of trouble.
[02:25:54.323 --> 02:25:55.064]  Well, that's for sure.
[02:25:55.384 --> 02:25:57.626]  Hey, my line is a sandman.
[02:25:57.846 --> 02:26:00.649]  It's just been kind of a slow boil.
[02:26:01.932 --> 02:26:09.942]  Side swipe by an illegal and then I got hit in the rear by, uh, my car did, uh, by a, uh, illegal, but...
[02:26:10.731 --> 02:26:13.632]  You know, almost everybody I know has been hit by an illegal.
[02:26:14.512 --> 02:26:17.613]  And almost everybody I know who's been to Mexico has been robbed by the police.
[02:26:18.213 --> 02:26:21.214]  But we're just supposed to just totally adopt a failed, collapsed country.
[02:26:21.614 --> 02:26:24.515]  And yeah, these illegals drive like psychomaniacs.
[02:26:24.835 --> 02:26:26.435]  They get to drunk drive everything else.
[02:26:26.855 --> 02:26:33.117]  But then the police, no matter what color you are, will throw the book at citizens because they know we're chumps.
[02:26:33.897 --> 02:26:35.979]  They know we're chumps and will go pay the tickets.
[02:26:36.239 --> 02:26:38.521]  And that's discrimination that I'm sick of.
[02:26:38.782 --> 02:26:46.589]  Not because I hate people south of the border, but because they are allowed to walk all over us because we are a nation of chumps.
[02:26:46.669 --> 02:26:47.510]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:26:48.531 --> 02:26:50.733]  Yeah, all three of those things have happened to me.
[02:26:50.813 --> 02:26:53.715]  I've been to Mexico and been hit up by the cops many times.
[02:26:54.176 --> 02:26:54.957]  Well, you deserve it.
[02:26:55.037 --> 02:26:56.238]  I mean, if you're white, you deserve it.
[02:26:57.293 --> 02:27:02.217]  Well, uh... Listen, the Mexican cops shake down brown-skinned people even more.
[02:27:02.817 --> 02:27:04.699]  So, I mean, I've seen that statistically.
[02:27:05.039 --> 02:27:06.300]  So it's not like they're being racist.
[02:27:06.320 --> 02:27:10.183]  They actually, they didn't get away with shaking Mexicans down more than blacks or whites.
[02:27:10.223 --> 02:27:15.147]  And if you're a Mexican-American, look out, they'll really come after you, in my experience down in Mexico.
[02:27:15.187 --> 02:27:16.008]  But go ahead, sorry.
[02:27:16.948 --> 02:27:22.793]  Just a few years ago, I had to fill out white instead of Hispanic, but that's all changed now.
[02:27:23.253 --> 02:27:26.416]  Anyway, the thing, the thing that is kind of
[02:27:27.425 --> 02:27:37.091]  Kind of set me off or push me over the edge is that I just recently applied for a passport and I had one like 20 years ago and lost it.
[02:27:37.271 --> 02:27:37.991]  Used it and lost it.
[02:27:38.011 --> 02:27:55.442]  That's when I was traveling in Central America and Mexico and stuff, but they have written me back saying that the long-form birth certificate that I supplied said that I was born at home and that there's no medical
[02:27:56.465 --> 02:27:59.007]  Official record of my birth.
[02:27:59.267 --> 02:28:11.676]  So they're questioning whether I'm an American or not, and they're not going to issue me a passport unless I can produce some kind of official record.
[02:28:11.696 --> 02:28:12.817]  A family Bible is?
[02:28:13.437 --> 02:28:22.083]  Or you can find out who the doctor was you first saw after that, or they can get affidavits from family.
[02:28:22.103 --> 02:28:22.984]  You're gonna have to get a lawyer.
[02:28:24.119 --> 02:28:31.381]  Yeah, I tell you what, I'll get one eventually, but it's just... Oh yeah, they've made it to legally be a citizen, or even if you are, almost impossible.
[02:28:32.141 --> 02:28:47.085]  Again, I told people ten years ago with TSA, because I saw the C-SPAN hearing when they admitted it, they wanted to break our will, make us feel horrible going through TSA, then go, oh, come pre-screen with us, come have a TSA interview, jump through hoops, and then we'll only search you sometimes.
[02:28:47.725 --> 02:28:48.686]  And so it's the same thing
[02:28:50.106 --> 02:28:51.086]  with the open borders.
[02:28:51.526 --> 02:28:54.647]  You want to come here, be illegal, cheat the system, do whatever, that's fine.
[02:28:55.187 --> 02:28:58.768]  But if you want to become a legal citizen, it takes about 14 years.
[02:28:59.488 --> 02:29:06.249]  And now I'm hearing about more and more people where the records get lost at the hospital or home births.
[02:29:06.870 --> 02:29:10.250]  They want you in the system from birth and they're going to say you don't exist.
[02:29:10.650 --> 02:29:11.391]  Good to hear from you.
[02:29:11.411 --> 02:29:13.091]  I appreciate your call, Ramon.
[02:29:13.431 --> 02:29:14.591]  That is really frustrating.
[02:29:14.931 --> 02:29:16.072]  Let's go to John in PA.
[02:29:16.092 --> 02:29:17.172]  We'll hold him over if need be.
[02:29:17.212 --> 02:29:17.532]  Go ahead.
[02:29:18.715 --> 02:29:19.656]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:29:19.837 --> 02:29:20.257]  Good, brother.
[02:29:33.564 --> 02:29:37.648]  You know, putting this symbol up for some racial outrage that doesn't even exist.
[02:29:37.688 --> 02:29:38.149]  Stay there.
[02:29:38.689 --> 02:29:41.512]  I don't get your point yet because you haven't been able to finish, but I've got mine on this.
[02:29:41.912 --> 02:29:43.254]  I think it's almost subliminal.
[02:29:43.294 --> 02:29:44.055]  Like, we give up.
[02:29:44.375 --> 02:29:45.056]  We submit.
[02:29:45.316 --> 02:29:46.917]  The new freedom is put your hands up.
[02:29:46.957 --> 02:29:47.558]  I'm a prisoner.
[02:29:47.578 --> 02:29:48.539]  Because that's what TSA is.
[02:29:49.620 --> 02:29:51.521]  Is go through, you're a president, put your hands up.
[02:29:52.602 --> 02:29:53.883]  And so, it's just sick.
[02:29:53.923 --> 02:29:55.785]  And then Obama acting like he cares so much.
[02:29:55.805 --> 02:29:59.087]  Because, you know, he's taking your job, so he might as well say, you know, he cares about you.
[02:29:59.227 --> 02:29:59.787]  We're on the march.
[02:29:59.807 --> 02:30:00.288]  We'll be right back.
[02:30:00.628 --> 02:30:02.209]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.150 --> 02:30:05.832]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.484 --> 02:30:15.885]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:30:17.146 --> 02:30:21.887]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:30:22.287 --> 02:30:28.829]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:30:31.009 --> 02:30:33.190]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:30:35.070 --> 02:30:37.331]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:30:39.509 --> 02:30:43.372]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:30:44.093 --> 02:30:47.215]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[02:30:47.936 --> 02:30:48.757]  Others don't.
[02:30:49.177 --> 02:30:51.038]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:30:51.319 --> 02:30:52.820]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[02:30:53.100 --> 02:30:55.682]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:30:55.982 --> 02:31:02.248]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:31:02.608 --> 02:31:04.830]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:31:05.310 --> 02:31:07.332]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[02:31:07.692 --> 02:31:08.493]  Others don't.
[02:31:10.359 --> 02:31:13.741]  We've had an amazing year here at Supernatural Silver.
[02:31:13.961 --> 02:31:23.387]  We've truly enjoyed the fantastic response from thousands of people as they've tried our extraordinary product, and we're thrilled at the life-changing results people have.

[02:32:09.844 --> 02:32:12.426]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:32:12.686 --> 02:32:17.550]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:32:17.810 --> 02:32:25.696]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:32:25.937 --> 02:32:30.240]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:32:30.460 --> 02:32:34.263]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:32:34.423 --> 02:32:40.124]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:32:40.364 --> 02:32:43.145]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:32:43.525 --> 02:32:48.726]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[02:32:48.886 --> 02:32:57.008]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[02:32:57.068 --> 02:32:57.249]  That's 866-229-0927.
[02:33:03.610 --> 02:33:05.952]  Do business with someone who shares your values.
[02:33:06.232 --> 02:33:08.974]  BuyPatriotsupply.com slash Alex.
[02:33:20.323 --> 02:33:30.491]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[02:33:32.575 --> 02:33:35.898]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[02:33:36.318 --> 02:33:39.641]  I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.
[02:33:39.921 --> 02:33:42.083]  It's a military mission in North St.
[02:33:42.123 --> 02:33:42.484]  Louis.
[02:33:42.764 --> 02:33:45.046]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town.
[02:33:45.326 --> 02:33:49.830]  And don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[02:33:49.990 --> 02:33:54.494]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[02:33:54.774 --> 02:33:55.655]  Guns will be taken.
[02:33:55.675 --> 02:33:56.896]  No one will be able to be armed.
[02:33:57.176 --> 02:33:58.157]  We will take all weapons.
[02:33:58.357 --> 02:34:00.678]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[02:34:00.738 --> 02:34:05.101]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[02:34:05.301 --> 02:34:05.581]  Enough.
[02:34:06.161 --> 02:34:06.421]  Enough.
[02:34:06.962 --> 02:34:07.242]  Enough.
[02:34:08.022 --> 02:34:08.242]  Enough.
[02:34:08.382 --> 02:34:12.865]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[02:34:12.945 --> 02:34:16.887]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[02:34:19.028 --> 02:34:32.380]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[02:34:32.520 --> 02:34:35.102]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[02:34:36.123 --> 02:34:37.704]  Somebody else made that happen.
[02:34:38.544 --> 02:34:44.526]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[02:34:44.826 --> 02:34:49.488]  Blackhawk choppers soaring through the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[02:34:49.788 --> 02:34:54.470]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[02:35:02.222 --> 02:35:07.228]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[02:35:07.569 --> 02:35:08.790]  You're in your apartment!
[02:35:08.870 --> 02:35:10.052]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[02:35:10.192 --> 02:35:11.113]  Go back inside right now!
[02:35:11.213 --> 02:35:11.974]  I am inside.
[02:35:12.275 --> 02:35:13.316]  I have two words for you.
[02:35:14.157 --> 02:35:14.998]  Predator groans.
[02:35:15.999 --> 02:35:17.001]  You will never see it coming.
[02:35:21.027 --> 02:35:23.488]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras.
[02:35:23.889 --> 02:35:33.033]  Parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[02:35:33.133 --> 02:35:38.396]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in, and now they're coming in like they're trespassers, punching and shoving people.
[02:35:38.576 --> 02:35:43.379]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down!
[02:35:43.659 --> 02:35:45.720]  If you want them, come and take them!
[02:35:47.321 --> 02:35:48.803]  We are on the march.
[02:35:49.124 --> 02:35:51.688]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:35:51.988 --> 02:35:56.736]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:36:11.560 --> 02:36:16.624]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[02:36:17.084 --> 02:36:20.086]  This is the heart of 1776!
[02:36:22.047 --> 02:36:23.949]  Alright folks, we are back live.
[02:36:23.989 --> 02:36:27.952]  I wanted to air that police state piece that Derrick McBrain made like a year ago.
[02:36:28.965 --> 02:36:44.824]  Because it illustrates we are against the police state, but we want to legitimately criticize it, expose it, and legislatively change it, but also state, if you follow UN globalist orders, outside of law, to try to take our guns,
[02:36:46.098 --> 02:36:47.881]  Then it will mean confrontation.
[02:36:48.843 --> 02:36:53.430]  And we're doing that in an organized, focused, serious fashion.
[02:36:54.192 --> 02:36:59.441]  You're not going to catch pro-gun groups burning down churches and shooting at firefighters.
[02:37:00.694 --> 02:37:18.503]  You're going to catch us strapping guns to our back and going to San Antonio where they say it's illegal to open carry and we're going to do it right in front of the police just like Rosa Parks sitting at the front of the bus in civil disobedience and open carry folks are doing that all over the country for our God-given rights, the true civil rights movement.
[02:37:20.363 --> 02:37:27.667]  But you get the NFL and MSNBC and all the usual suspects involved pushing
[02:37:29.961 --> 02:37:38.245]  And trying to get everybody fighting with each other, that's all the Democrats have.
[02:37:39.805 --> 02:37:41.046]  It's all they've ever had.
[02:37:42.086 --> 02:37:43.547]  They need to change the subject.
[02:37:44.007 --> 02:37:47.589]  Of course out of 320 million people, you can find some tragedies out there.
[02:37:48.489 --> 02:37:52.391]  And they're wrong, and we should make something out of it, but Brown appears to not be it.
[02:37:54.107 --> 02:37:55.388]  They tried with Trayvon Martin.
[02:37:55.408 --> 02:37:56.308]  They're trying with this.
[02:37:56.328 --> 02:37:57.468]  It's so obvious.
[02:37:58.289 --> 02:38:00.870]  While they screw us over, they're doing this.
[02:38:00.970 --> 02:38:01.850]  And it's dangerous.
[02:38:03.931 --> 02:38:07.073]  We have Charles Barkley basically speaking to this as well.
[02:38:07.353 --> 02:38:12.535]  And of course, he'll be called a sellout as well because he doesn't want a civil war either.
[02:38:14.568 --> 02:38:17.490]  I got more support now than I got negativity.
[02:38:17.810 --> 02:38:22.174]  I know some of the... That's like them jackasses who are looting.
[02:38:22.694 --> 02:38:24.035]  Those aren't real black people.
[02:38:24.075 --> 02:38:25.136]  Those are scumbags.
[02:38:25.709 --> 02:38:28.412]  No, real black people, they're not out there looting.
[02:38:28.873 --> 02:38:36.981]  I just watched a great story on CNN where a bunch of folks, really amazing folks, wouldn't let them burn down an establishment.
[02:38:37.482 --> 02:38:38.583]  It was a great story.
[02:38:39.704 --> 02:38:44.410]  You know, I was in Philly this summer when I saw four black kids went in a store
[02:38:45.070 --> 02:38:47.031]  And left money when nobody was in the store.
[02:38:47.451 --> 02:38:53.314]  But unfortunately, the way the media portrays a lot of black people, we only put the negative black people on television, Mike.
[02:38:53.514 --> 02:38:55.795]  We don't put the good, hard-working black people.
[02:38:56.136 --> 02:38:58.737]  And that's what I said, and that's what I meant.
[02:38:59.157 --> 02:39:06.661]  There's a perception among some black people, you're not a thug, a hood rat, you don't wear your pants down by your ass, you're not black enough.
[02:39:07.121 --> 02:39:09.782]  And they're always holding us back, plain and simple.
[02:39:10.242 --> 02:39:13.184]  And I ain't shedding up, and I ain't backing down.
[02:39:13.854 --> 02:39:15.135]  Well, and you never do.
[02:39:15.415 --> 02:39:20.378]  So let's, since you brought up Ferguson, let's bring that up because we've been talking about it in the first hour of this show.
[02:39:21.058 --> 02:39:38.189]  Your reaction to the reaction in Ferguson, now me as a white person, I see that as a reflection of black America's mistrust of white authority and the American judicial system, and I mean, to me, it was going to happen, because there's just no trust out there.
[02:39:38.469 --> 02:39:40.010]  How did you see that whole situation?
[02:39:40.438 --> 02:39:42.181]  Well, I thought it was really unfortunate.
[02:39:42.681 --> 02:39:53.016]  Like I say, I need to really read the grand jury, because, you know, Mike, we live in a quick story media, social network situation.
[02:39:53.036 --> 02:39:56.341]  You know, I'm hearing things today I haven't heard at all.
[02:39:57.277 --> 02:40:03.339]  Uh, you know, that even the black witnesses said this guy came 20 feet at the officer.
[02:40:03.819 --> 02:40:06.880]  They were fighting inside the car and two bullets went off.
[02:40:07.380 --> 02:40:09.741]  You know, I didn't know the kid came.
[02:40:10.021 --> 02:40:11.641]  I mean, the blood splattered.
[02:40:11.661 --> 02:40:13.622]  So the guy came at the cop 20 feet.
[02:40:14.902 --> 02:40:21.567]  I'm not saying who's right or wrong, I'm just hearing the true story that came out of the grand jury investigation.
[02:40:21.707 --> 02:40:29.832]  Yeah, the evidence would lead you to believe that the officer acted properly, but the mistrust, black people aren't going to ever see that.
[02:40:30.492 --> 02:40:31.993]  And that's where the problem lies.
[02:40:32.413 --> 02:40:33.694]  Well, but let me just say this, man.
[02:40:34.015 --> 02:40:35.896]  I think we have to be weak, weak.
[02:40:36.376 --> 02:40:39.518]  I know I'm black, but I'm going to try to always be honest and fair.
[02:40:39.898 --> 02:40:43.761]  We have to be really careful with the cops, man, because if it wasn't for the cops,
[02:40:44.435 --> 02:40:47.116]  We'd be living in the wild, wild west in our neighborhoods.
[02:40:47.796 --> 02:40:54.218]  I think we can't pick out certain incidents that don't go our way and act like the cops are all bad.
[02:40:54.238 --> 02:40:57.760]  I hate when we do that, because think about it.
[02:40:58.740 --> 02:41:02.501]  Do you know how bad some of these neighborhoods would be if it wasn't for the cops?
[02:41:04.262 --> 02:41:07.763]  Listen, first of all, it's always great to play Monday morning quarterback.
[02:41:08.877 --> 02:41:09.838]  Like, he shot him a lot.
[02:41:09.878 --> 02:41:14.219]  Like, well, if you've got a gun and you're fighting with somebody, you're not going to shoot them once.
[02:41:14.259 --> 02:41:16.060]  You're going to pull the trigger X amount of times.
[02:41:16.480 --> 02:41:18.601]  Like I say, I don't know what happened in Ferguson.
[02:41:18.661 --> 02:41:19.701]  Nobody knows what happened.
[02:41:20.201 --> 02:41:25.403]  I want to take the time, as a responsible person, read the grand jury statement.
[02:41:26.504 --> 02:41:29.425]  Like I say, I didn't know they got to fight inside the car.
[02:41:30.625 --> 02:41:34.187]  That tells me something like, wow, there's two shots in the car.
[02:41:34.207 --> 02:41:37.028]  I really like Charles Barkley.
[02:41:37.711 --> 02:41:41.712]  I mean, he really is a smart guy who really tries to think everything out.
[02:41:42.152 --> 02:41:43.193]  And that's what I try to do.
[02:41:44.813 --> 02:41:46.754]  That's what I basically want here.
[02:41:47.234 --> 02:41:51.215]  But separately, the Brown thing isn't even important compared to what's happening in the world.
[02:41:51.976 --> 02:41:54.016]  15 million people starve to death a year.
[02:41:55.117 --> 02:41:56.457]  15 million children starve to death.
[02:41:56.477 --> 02:41:57.637]  Another 20 million adults.
[02:41:58.378 --> 02:41:59.458]  About a third of them in Africa.
[02:42:01.038 --> 02:42:13.063]  I mean, I don't brag about myself and stuff, but I've researched charities where 90% of it actually goes to people and they dig wells and buy them calves and cows and try to get electricity into the areas.
[02:42:13.163 --> 02:42:16.284]  And I give to four or five charities, mainly in Africa.
[02:42:16.524 --> 02:42:17.885]  I've never told that story before.
[02:42:19.775 --> 02:42:21.538]  Because I want to actually help those people.
[02:42:21.858 --> 02:42:26.105]  And I fight to keep the GMO that Bill Gates wants to give them, close quote.
[02:42:26.425 --> 02:42:29.891]  But that's not because I'm some bleeding heart and have some guilt about black people.
[02:42:30.612 --> 02:42:34.337]  I've donated money to poor kids in the Philippines and poor kids in Guatemala.
[02:42:35.509 --> 02:42:48.515]  But I go out and I do the research on charities that I know aren't globalist fronts, and I know aren't pushing New World Order agendas and saying, we'll dig you a well, but everybody in the village has got to take these vaccines.
[02:42:49.455 --> 02:42:52.437]  Or we'll give each, you know, family a cow.
[02:42:54.598 --> 02:42:58.299]  With the heifer program, my grandma likes that a lot, so I've been involved in it as well.
[02:42:59.660 --> 02:43:01.441]  And then you find out there's an agenda behind it.
[02:43:02.850 --> 02:43:04.891]  And it's not because I'm some bleeding heart.
[02:43:05.571 --> 02:43:11.152]  You're supposed to, as a successful person, go out and find people you want to help.
[02:43:12.152 --> 02:43:17.214]  But when the government says, oh, just give us your tax money, we'll hand it out and we'll help who we want to help.
[02:43:17.574 --> 02:43:21.695]  Oh, let us federalize health care that's already screwed up because of federalization.
[02:43:21.935 --> 02:43:24.956]  And of course it's now a train wreck because it's designed to be.
[02:43:26.892 --> 02:43:29.494]  The special interests want big government.
[02:43:29.834 --> 02:43:41.702]  Microsoft, Miller Brewing, IBM, Google, all, every globalist company, AT&T, Time Warner, every one of them.
[02:43:42.904 --> 02:43:43.705]  Except Ford.
[02:43:43.925 --> 02:43:45.766]  I'm not saying Ford's some great corporation.
[02:43:45.786 --> 02:43:47.107]  I've just noticed they don't give to a lot of it.
[02:43:47.707 --> 02:43:54.412]  Is giving to take the guns, to open the borders, to cut the wages, to shut up world government, to feed you GMO.
[02:43:54.693 --> 02:43:55.773]  I mean, they are in there.
[02:43:55.873 --> 02:43:57.174]  They are the enemy.
[02:43:58.976 --> 02:44:00.857]  They are the people devaluing the dollar.
[02:44:02.278 --> 02:44:06.441]  They're the people that have jacked up our gas prices artificially through OPEC for the last 30 years.
[02:44:06.641 --> 02:44:08.823]  And now because they want to bankrupt Russia, they're lowering the price.
[02:44:09.716 --> 02:44:15.481]  Once Russia's bankrupted, because they lowered the price some, by selling oil cheap, then it's going to go sky high.
[02:44:15.501 --> 02:44:21.386]  You'll be paying $15, $10, depending on where you live, $10 to $20 is where they want it.
[02:44:21.547 --> 02:44:26.111]  The UN has said different numbers of $14 to $16, $10, it varies.
[02:44:26.451 --> 02:44:30.534]  I mean, once they've bankrupted Russia... See, why am I against bankrupting Russia?
[02:44:31.235 --> 02:44:33.197]  Because it's a massive screw job.
[02:44:34.038 --> 02:44:35.539]  Russia isn't starting fights.
[02:44:35.899 --> 02:44:37.421]  Russia's selling energy cheap.
[02:44:37.781 --> 02:44:39.122]  The cartel doesn't like it.
[02:44:39.463 --> 02:44:40.764]  That should upset you.
[02:44:41.425 --> 02:44:43.166]  Shutting Russia down should upset you.
[02:44:43.366 --> 02:44:44.868]  We need some competition in the world.
[02:44:46.587 --> 02:44:48.308]  Just like shutting down our power plants.
[02:44:48.688 --> 02:44:55.110]  I obsess on that because 59% of our power seven years ago came from coal plants.
[02:44:55.510 --> 02:44:57.931]  It was 50% a few years ago.
[02:44:58.011 --> 02:44:58.711]  Now it's something like 37.
[02:44:58.811 --> 02:45:02.533]  They are shutting our power off.
[02:45:03.893 --> 02:45:07.394]  Detroit lights are off in Detroit.
[02:45:07.574 --> 02:45:09.935]  They turned the street lights off months ago.
[02:45:10.235 --> 02:45:11.816]  Now they don't even have power, period!
[02:45:13.797 --> 02:45:15.698]  We're being shut down here, people!
[02:45:15.718 --> 02:45:17.538]  I don't care what color you are!
[02:45:17.718 --> 02:45:18.779]  We're being screwed over!
[02:45:19.699 --> 02:45:23.020]  Excuse me, I went to those clips, haven't gone to your calls, and I'm getting upset.
[02:45:23.840 --> 02:45:25.041]  I'm getting upset, I'm gonna settle down.
[02:45:25.821 --> 02:45:27.342]  I'm gonna settle down.
[02:45:27.402 --> 02:45:28.622]  Okay, I've learned not to get mad.
[02:45:30.643 --> 02:45:31.763]  Okay, okay, okay.
[02:45:31.783 --> 02:45:33.044]  I'm not putting on an act here.
[02:45:33.064 --> 02:45:34.744]  People know I really have problems blowing up.
[02:45:35.444 --> 02:45:37.405]  I've gotten a lot better not blowing up around the office.
[02:45:37.985 --> 02:45:39.846]  I've gotten a lot better not blowing up in my private life.
[02:45:40.006 --> 02:45:40.966]  So I'm not gonna blow up.
[02:45:41.747 --> 02:45:42.567]  I'm not gonna blow up.
[02:45:43.886 --> 02:45:45.027]  I am just sick of it!
[02:45:45.687 --> 02:45:46.307]  I am sick!
[02:45:46.347 --> 02:45:51.790]  And what you said, these hood rats, these scum, and they're not scum because they're black.
[02:45:51.970 --> 02:45:54.612]  I would, I hate the white drag rats.
[02:45:54.632 --> 02:45:58.534]  They got white drag rats in Austin that I've talked about for years that rob people.
[02:46:00.089 --> 02:46:01.090]  And man, I tell you what.
[02:46:01.450 --> 02:46:03.892]  One time I had like nine of them try to demand I give them money.
[02:46:04.892 --> 02:46:06.093]  Said something smart-mouthed to me.
[02:46:06.474 --> 02:46:07.454]  And I was there with a friend.
[02:46:07.494 --> 02:46:08.475]  Tommy Pallotta was there.
[02:46:09.115 --> 02:46:10.076]  And we walked out of a restaurant.
[02:46:10.096 --> 02:46:10.576]  I turned around.
[02:46:10.616 --> 02:46:11.317]  I said, come on!
[02:46:11.517 --> 02:46:13.719]  I will kick every one of your asses right now.
[02:46:15.620 --> 02:46:16.240]  And they backed off.
[02:46:16.260 --> 02:46:17.641]  They're like, hey man, why don't you give us some money?
[02:46:17.661 --> 02:46:18.682]  Yeah, punk.
[02:46:20.103 --> 02:46:21.144]  It's like a soft robbery.
[02:46:21.164 --> 02:46:21.864]  And I turned around.
[02:46:21.884 --> 02:46:23.566]  I'm not saying I'm a tough guy.
[02:46:23.586 --> 02:46:24.266]  I just can't help it.
[02:46:24.486 --> 02:46:25.167]  And I said, listen!
[02:46:25.627 --> 02:46:25.987]  Get up!
[02:46:26.267 --> 02:46:26.648]  Let's go!
[02:46:28.206 --> 02:46:31.947]  When Tommy made the joke, he goes, yeah, you knew that I was going to back you up, right?
[02:46:32.127 --> 02:46:33.147]  That's why you just did that?
[02:46:33.587 --> 02:46:35.127]  No, it's not that I got something to prove.
[02:46:35.427 --> 02:46:37.828]  I know they've robbed a bunch of women on bicycles.
[02:46:38.948 --> 02:46:42.689]  I know people that have been robbed by those people, and I want to beat the hell out of them.
[02:46:43.269 --> 02:46:44.809]  And it's not because I'm looking for trouble.
[02:46:44.929 --> 02:46:46.349]  I'm sick of gangs.
[02:46:46.749 --> 02:46:51.330]  Like I said last week, I don't care if it's a black gang, or a white gang, or a cop gang.
[02:46:51.530 --> 02:46:53.530]  You act like a bunch of thugs, I don't like you.
[02:46:53.910 --> 02:46:55.471]  I didn't mean to start ranting, I apologize.
[02:46:55.491 --> 02:46:56.651]  I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[02:46:59.582 --> 02:47:00.163]  Hold on just a minute.
[02:47:00.583 --> 02:47:01.024]  Alright.
[02:47:01.904 --> 02:47:02.545]  Hold on just a minute.
[02:47:02.885 --> 02:47:03.866]  Alright, here we go.
[02:47:04.948 --> 02:47:06.750]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are offering...
[02:47:07.984 --> 02:47:11.446]  The biggest sales we've ever had and it's how we fund our operation.
[02:47:11.686 --> 02:47:13.087]  This is really like a money bomb for us.
[02:47:13.407 --> 02:47:20.231]  Selling high quality products at very low prices to help fund into the next year and an expansion of our news division and things we need to do like that.
[02:47:21.152 --> 02:47:23.033]  And plus we just sell super high quality products.
[02:47:23.073 --> 02:47:25.675]  Seven months free for the nightly news and all the films.
[02:47:25.715 --> 02:47:26.715]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:47:26.735 --> 02:47:27.396]  Sign up for a year.
[02:47:27.416 --> 02:47:28.096]  It's $29.95 instead of $59.95.
[02:47:28.136 --> 02:47:28.496]  That's $30 off.
[02:47:28.536 --> 02:47:30.177]  Silver will sell out 20% off and free shipping on single bottles.
[02:47:36.261 --> 02:47:42.542]  Four bottles, get the fifth free and 20% off, and a free bottle, fifth bottle, of Silver Bullet.
[02:47:42.582 --> 02:47:44.283]  We're about to sell out of the Nation Iodine.
[02:47:44.303 --> 02:47:47.303]  We'll only have the regular Iodine, that's excellent as well, regular Survival Shield.
[02:47:47.603 --> 02:47:54.725]  But two bottles of Survival Shield, free, with your order of DNA Force.
[02:47:54.825 --> 02:48:01.686]  Two bottles of the regular Survival Shield, absolutely free when you order the DNA Force.

[02:48:04.835 --> 02:48:11.158]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:48:11.739 --> 02:48:17.102]  And they tell me that some of these sales are so extreme that they're not even profitable.
[02:48:17.442 --> 02:48:17.862]  I don't care.
[02:48:17.882 --> 02:48:19.183]  I just want to give everybody a really good deal.
[02:48:20.003 --> 02:48:22.124]  And overall, introduce people to these products.
[02:48:22.465 --> 02:48:24.806]  The Infowars Lifeline, you name it, have been truly life-changing.
[02:48:24.826 --> 02:48:26.807]  I mean, look how much different I look if you're watching me on TV.
[02:48:27.227 --> 02:48:28.828]  And I still live the same way I lived.
[02:48:28.908 --> 02:48:29.889]  I work out the same amount.
[02:48:30.589 --> 02:48:45.481]  Whole nine yards, and I'd gotten to 279 pounds, 278 pounds, battled down to about 250, 245, and couldn't, and I've dropped down to 220, 220, and it's just amazing.
[02:48:46.302 --> 02:48:51.767]  And my blood pressure is now not low, but for 40, about to be 41, they said it's almost low.
[02:48:52.492 --> 02:49:05.778]  I went and got a doctor checkup two weeks ago, and I hadn't been in there in six months, and they said, my God, your blood pressure was really high two years ago, only a little bit high six months ago, and now it's super.
[02:49:06.958 --> 02:49:08.779]  In fact, I ought to get my blood pressure report.
[02:49:09.099 --> 02:49:10.700]  They did blood tests and stuff too.
[02:49:11.320 --> 02:49:12.281]  My sugar was a little high.
[02:49:13.137 --> 02:49:15.698]  That's because I eat too much sugar.
[02:49:16.798 --> 02:49:19.058]  It wasn't like pre-diabetic or anything, but that was my only issue.
[02:49:19.278 --> 02:49:21.399]  I've got all my blood tests, all my reports, everything.
[02:49:22.839 --> 02:49:26.120]  And it's these products with the moderate exercise.
[02:49:27.360 --> 02:49:32.062]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:49:32.542 --> 02:49:34.302]  John and PA, I'm sorry for making you hold.
[02:49:34.582 --> 02:49:35.502]  Go ahead and finish your point.
[02:49:35.902 --> 02:49:37.783]  You were talking about what hands up, don't shoot means?
[02:49:38.706 --> 02:49:49.460]  Yeah, yeah, like you said, it's a symbolic surrender, it's a sort of prototypical Nazi salute, it's a, you know, brown shirt, we'll see Mike Brown shirt, we'll just see more and more of these instances.
[02:49:49.980 --> 02:49:54.146]  And one more thing, the 1033 program Obama announced yesterday,
[02:49:55.120 --> 02:49:59.004]  He's not going to end 1033, he's going to make sure it's consistent everywhere.
[02:49:59.084 --> 02:50:05.329]  So we just announced the rollout of military, you know, stormtroopers everywhere and no one's able to see it.
[02:50:05.469 --> 02:50:06.530]  And we not predict that.
[02:50:06.570 --> 02:50:11.955]  They're going to have the UN come in and then they're going to say federalized police, militarize them as the answer.
[02:50:13.035 --> 02:50:17.139]  I will tell you, New York liberals have no idea what's going on.
[02:50:17.199 --> 02:50:19.401]  My social circle, they're out of it.
[02:50:20.402 --> 02:50:28.670]  I saw mainly white people marching and being all mad at the police in New York, blaming them for Brown, as if every cop in the world is guilty.
[02:50:28.870 --> 02:50:30.832]  But the globalists, they're guilty of nothing.
[02:50:32.222 --> 02:50:32.763]  Right, of course.
[02:50:32.783 --> 02:50:38.251]  Well, yeah, they, you know, they just promote Planned Parenthood and climate change and, you know, they'll buy into it.
[02:50:38.612 --> 02:50:39.814]  People will buy into anything, man.
[02:50:40.114 --> 02:50:42.157]  Oh, I tell you, that's what I'm worried about is the trendies.
[02:50:42.237 --> 02:50:44.240]  I mean, they don't know what planet they're on.
[02:50:44.761 --> 02:50:45.683]  I appreciate your call.
[02:50:45.723 --> 02:50:46.284]  God bless you.
[02:50:48.106 --> 02:50:49.207]  Man, I tell you, I'm ranting.
[02:50:49.527 --> 02:50:50.728]  Dan in Illinois, I'll go to you.
[02:50:50.748 --> 02:50:51.429]  Thanks for holding.
[02:50:52.069 --> 02:50:54.431]  And then Ralph and Spencer and Robert.
[02:50:55.452 --> 02:50:57.473]  Again, we're broadcasting worldwide.
[02:50:57.593 --> 02:50:58.674]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:50:59.755 --> 02:51:01.676]  And you can follow us on Twitter at RealAlexJones.
[02:51:01.716 --> 02:51:03.898]  I'm going to go walk around, settle down during this break.
[02:51:04.899 --> 02:51:05.820]  And we'll be back.
[02:51:05.840 --> 02:51:06.180]  Stay with us.

[02:51:25.022 --> 02:51:27.102]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.
[02:51:27.342 --> 02:51:31.884]  Is it time to convert paper 401ks and IRAs to solid gold and silver yet?

[02:52:09.941 --> 02:52:13.965]  There may be a hidden danger lurking in our homes and surroundings.
[02:52:14.105 --> 02:52:16.747]  Without the right equipment, you'll never know it's there.
[02:52:16.888 --> 02:52:24.615]  Natural and man-made nuclear radiation can find its way into our living environment, and maser instruments are your best line of defense.
[02:52:25.015 --> 02:52:33.666]  Unlike lower-cost products, Maser Instruments detects all forms of nuclear radiation, including alpha, beta, gamma, and x-rays.
[02:52:34.086 --> 02:52:39.954]  Most products require you manually turn them on for each use, but Maser Instruments are different.
[02:52:40.274 --> 02:52:41.015]  They're designed to
[02:52:41.015 --> 02:52:41.595]  We're good.
[02:53:09.500 --> 02:53:14.443]  Do you have relatives and friends that are convinced there's no need ever to prepare for any kind of emergency?
[02:53:14.624 --> 02:53:17.125]  Are these also folks you buy Christmas presents for?
[02:53:17.626 --> 02:53:21.608]  At 30dayfoodsupply.com, we can solve both of these problems at the same time.
[02:53:21.928 --> 02:53:27.052]  Go to 30dayfoodsupply.com or call 541-229-0010.
[02:53:27.292 --> 02:53:29.313]  We can ship your Christmas presents directly to them.
[02:53:29.593 --> 02:53:38.399]  Choose from our original $99 30-day food supply, our long-term storage vegan burger mixes, and other oatmeal, soups, porridges, beans, and granolas for everyday use.
[02:53:38.800 --> 02:53:39.360]  All products are
[02:53:39.360 --> 02:53:39.960]  We're good.
[02:54:09.264 --> 02:54:11.607]  Yeah.
[02:54:11.807 --> 02:54:12.768]  You know why I get mad?
[02:54:12.788 --> 02:54:15.311]  It's because I'm so frustrated.
[02:54:15.331 --> 02:54:18.575]  There's all this news I wanted to get to that I didn't get to that's so important.
[02:54:18.595 --> 02:54:20.378]  And there's all these callers.
[02:54:20.498 --> 02:54:21.899]  And it's just so simple.
[02:54:21.939 --> 02:54:22.720]  This is staged.
[02:54:23.081 --> 02:54:25.063]  It's so simple they're stirring everybody up.
[02:54:25.824 --> 02:54:28.467]  And it just makes me so upset to see the mainstream media
[02:54:29.188 --> 02:54:32.589]  Race-baiting like this, and then this will only empower the police state.
[02:54:33.150 --> 02:54:35.490]  See, that's the rest of the story, and I meant to say that today.
[02:54:35.510 --> 02:54:37.071]  I'm glad the caller just mentioned it.
[02:54:37.451 --> 02:54:55.718]  I was watching CBS News again with the Bilderberg Group member Charlie Rose on there, and they're talking about the answer is federalization of police and more funding, which is the training, is the black uniforms, is the zero tolerance, kill everybody training.
[02:54:57.628 --> 02:55:00.769]  And so on top of it, Obama, oh, healthcare's messed up?
[02:55:00.869 --> 02:55:02.909]  I'll screw it up ten times worse because I love you.
[02:55:04.049 --> 02:55:08.450]  It's like they always come in and make it worse, and then grandstand up there.
[02:55:08.570 --> 02:55:15.952]  And then Planned Parenthood has joined in the demonstrations when their mission, they were founded to kill black people.
[02:55:18.072 --> 02:55:20.773]  And I wish Louis Faircom would do some good and talk about that.
[02:55:22.033 --> 02:55:25.414]  But no, no, no, no, it's only get upset about a thug brown.
[02:55:26.550 --> 02:55:27.651]  He's a thug in my view.
[02:55:31.014 --> 02:55:33.656]  Does that mean that then the cops are all angels?
[02:55:33.956 --> 02:55:35.878]  Absolutely not.
[02:55:37.039 --> 02:55:39.161]  And I fight that every single day.
[02:55:39.541 --> 02:55:41.082]  And I don't care what color you are.
[02:55:41.843 --> 02:55:46.307]  And by the way, if you're a good cop fighting a corrupt system, we've had Serpico on multiple times.
[02:55:46.347 --> 02:55:46.907]  He's a listener.
[02:55:48.388 --> 02:55:51.171]  But other cops that aren't as well known, we've defended and helped.
[02:55:52.782 --> 02:55:56.304]  We stand for justice, because I want justice in my life.
[02:55:56.664 --> 02:55:58.685]  I'm going to give you the best justice I can.
[02:55:59.405 --> 02:56:02.207]  And we need to start not liking thugs in this country.
[02:56:03.147 --> 02:56:03.607]  Period.
[02:56:04.768 --> 02:56:06.169]  I don't care if they got a uniform.
[02:56:06.209 --> 02:56:07.129]  I don't care who they are.
[02:56:07.449 --> 02:56:08.870]  You see a cop acting like a thug?
[02:56:09.370 --> 02:56:10.931]  I've done this a hundred times on video.
[02:56:11.431 --> 02:56:13.032]  I'll go over and tell them you're acting like a thug.
[02:56:13.292 --> 02:56:14.473]  And sometimes I get arrested.
[02:56:17.474 --> 02:56:18.735]  They don't have a right to act like that.
[02:56:18.935 --> 02:56:19.475]  But you know what?
[02:56:19.515 --> 02:56:21.296]  The public doesn't have a right to act like that either.
[02:56:21.456 --> 02:56:22.357]  We're all just people.
[02:56:25.256 --> 02:56:27.097]  Dan in Illinois, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:56:27.157 --> 02:56:27.477]  Welcome.
[02:56:29.098 --> 02:56:33.241]  Yeah, I want to thank you for being a great host and I enjoy your show.
[02:56:34.173 --> 02:56:50.298]  And I want to say, the way I'm going to draw my line in the sand is saying that I disagree with you when you say Benjamin Franklin, who was a member of the Hellfire Club, said his favorite Bible quote was, God helps those who help themselves.
[02:56:50.738 --> 02:56:52.698]  That is not even in the Bible.
[02:56:52.758 --> 02:56:55.019]  That is not an accurate Bible quote.
[02:56:55.439 --> 02:57:17.796]  Well, absolutely, I think you are right, and I don't remember saying exactly what you just said, but I'm not sure now that that history channel shows, I researched it, about him being in the Hellfire Club was true, and so when I said that ten years ago and played the clip, and then it turns out that where he lived in England after that was the place where two doctors lived that were doing an encyclopedia on
[02:57:18.997 --> 02:57:35.023]  On the anatomy, pre-Grey's anatomy, the encyclopedia, and that those dead bodies were from basically, you had to grave rob back then, when somebody died, to be able to actually do anatomy, because they were superstitious and wouldn't let the doctors do it.
[02:57:35.263 --> 02:57:37.484]  So I apologize to Benjamin Franklin.
[02:57:37.924 --> 02:57:40.345]  I believe that was a demonization campaign against him.
[02:57:40.525 --> 02:57:41.646]  But go ahead, sir, you've got the floor.
[02:57:43.342 --> 02:57:53.111]  That's from poor Richard's almanac, what he was quoting, and you got to be saved to fight the new world order, Alex.
[02:57:53.571 --> 02:57:56.915]  That's our only hope, and I disagree with you about the rapture.
[02:57:56.995 --> 02:58:06.263]  There is a rapture, and we will be saved, and those who are left behind are those who's going to face the Antichrist, not the true believers.
[02:58:06.884 --> 02:58:07.905]  Well, I sure hope you're right!
[02:58:10.376 --> 02:58:13.818]  This guy's word is right, and you got to learn it.
[02:58:14.279 --> 02:58:19.943]  Alex, before you got to say it on air, you got to study it and get into it and learn it.
[02:58:19.983 --> 02:58:23.405]  This is Bible Dan, and I'm the man with the Bible in his hand.
[02:58:23.425 --> 02:58:25.226]  Do you have a YouTube channel?
[02:58:27.248 --> 02:58:27.628]  Uh, me?
[02:58:27.888 --> 02:58:28.148]  Yeah.
[02:58:29.589 --> 02:58:34.453]  Uh, well, I'll start one if you help me out and be my first guest on my channel.
[02:58:35.407 --> 02:58:37.188]  You know, maybe I should start doing that to get activists.
[02:58:37.748 --> 02:58:38.489]  Maybe I'd do that.
[02:58:38.869 --> 02:58:41.230]  How about you start your channel, then we'll see about being a guest on there.
[02:58:41.250 --> 02:58:42.511]  All right, God bless you.
[02:58:42.531 --> 02:58:46.513]  I'm going to do some overdrive and go to Ralph and others that are patiently holding.

[02:59:33.656 --> 02:59:37.619]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:59:37.939 --> 02:59:39.400]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:59:39.720 --> 02:59:44.744]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[02:59:45.044 --> 02:59:47.306]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[02:59:47.586 --> 02:59:48.426]  But for how long?

[03:00:23.829 --> 03:00:30.835]  We are now entering overdrive with your host, Alex Jones, broadcasting live from the front lines.

[03:00:38.061 --> 03:00:38.802]  Let's move quick.
[03:00:38.982 --> 03:00:39.803]  I've been babbling.
[03:00:40.103 --> 03:00:41.804]  Ralph in Arizona, thanks for calling.
[03:00:41.844 --> 03:00:42.405]  You're on the air.
[03:00:44.907 --> 03:00:45.327]  Hello?
[03:00:45.667 --> 03:00:46.188]  Yes, welcome.
[03:00:48.615 --> 03:00:49.296]  Well, hello.
[03:00:49.376 --> 03:00:52.277]  It's my honor to meet you.
[03:00:52.297 --> 03:00:54.579]  I have the highest regard for the work you do.
[03:00:54.599 --> 03:00:56.340]  Well, thanks for putting up with me, brother.
[03:00:57.981 --> 03:01:00.662]  Well, I respect your scholarship.
[03:01:00.842 --> 03:01:10.728]  I respect the fact that you vet your sources and you cite and reference everything, and this is important to me.
[03:01:13.858 --> 03:01:22.965]  Uh, there's a lot that I'm not going to say, but you have asked what is my line in the sand.
[03:01:23.305 --> 03:01:23.826]  Is that correct?
[03:01:24.166 --> 03:01:24.586]  Yes, sir.
[03:01:26.167 --> 03:01:26.608]  All right.
[03:01:27.508 --> 03:01:34.254]  My line in the... Basically, okay.
[03:01:35.074 --> 03:01:38.677]  My line in the sand is basic lawlessness.
[03:01:40.218 --> 03:01:40.979]  When you have
[03:01:41.764 --> 03:01:53.870]  The lawlessness of government corporations and individuals that breaks down the foundation for civil society to function.
[03:01:55.591 --> 03:02:00.053]  For that reason, I don't think you're looking at a revolutionary situation.
[03:02:00.293 --> 03:02:04.935]  It's more what you'd call historically a reaction.
[03:02:06.556 --> 03:02:09.958]  And as you know, Robert Browning said, we live in visions of Rome.
[03:02:12.503 --> 03:02:35.510]  In the late Roman Empire, there were a series of pretenders who actually didn't possess the legitimate rights to citizenship who came in and occupied the consulate, and then from that, that led to a series of reactions.
[03:02:36.850 --> 03:02:38.611]  And the reestablishment of order,
[03:02:40.716 --> 03:02:47.079]  In those cases, the reaction was kind of short-lived, but hopefully not.
[03:02:47.979 --> 03:02:48.520]  No, you're right.
[03:02:48.540 --> 03:02:56.724]  I mean, we could have just reactions that restabilize things, but the globalists are trying to create anarchy so they can bring in more control is the answer.
[03:02:56.964 --> 03:02:58.165]  I think that's really what's happening.
[03:02:59.745 --> 03:03:02.747]  Yeah, that's right, and we must not let them.
[03:03:04.748 --> 03:03:08.250]  That's absolutely the situation.
[03:03:10.192 --> 03:03:21.922]  The other line in the sand, and this is a little bit more exotic, is Southeast German, Prussian, Krapolinian psychiatry.
[03:03:25.045 --> 03:03:34.814]  Most people don't know that psychiatry, in the case of Stalin and Hitler, it's always been the handmaiden of tyranny.
[03:03:36.846 --> 03:03:37.686]  Are you still with me?
[03:03:37.766 --> 03:03:39.287]  I'm listening to you, absolutely.
[03:03:39.307 --> 03:03:40.787]  I'm just seeing a new headline.
[03:03:41.067 --> 03:03:46.768]  Police blame the man killed by a hammer for his own murder, saying he was at the wrong place at the wrong time.
[03:03:47.409 --> 03:03:53.350]  How sick that, again, they are covering up what really happened.
[03:03:53.370 --> 03:03:54.270]  This is just incredible.
[03:03:54.290 --> 03:03:54.890]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:03:55.251 --> 03:03:56.611]  Very interesting points, you're right.
[03:03:57.711 --> 03:04:05.033]  And a lot of the German psychology that came out in the last 200 years also is a big part of this modern tyranny we're under.
[03:04:07.324 --> 03:04:09.045]  Uh, what was that last word?
[03:04:09.586 --> 03:04:10.706]  What kind of psychology?
[03:04:11.467 --> 03:04:18.610]  A lot of the psychology that came out of Germany in the last 200 years is, is, has been adopted as forms of oppression.
[03:04:20.031 --> 03:04:21.432]  Yeah, Emil Kraepelin.
[03:04:21.492 --> 03:04:23.013]  People don't realize this.
[03:04:23.153 --> 03:04:28.896]  In the 60s from Gidget series, you know, it's kind of Miley Cyrus.
[03:04:28.976 --> 03:04:30.176]  They did the same thing.
[03:04:30.216 --> 03:04:33.378]  You know, they start out with a sweet, innocent, young girl.
[03:04:34.119 --> 03:04:46.845]  And then they turn her into, turn them into whatever, you know, Hitler's ministry, Goebbels' ministry of enlightenment came to the United States in Operation Paperclip.
[03:04:47.781 --> 03:04:49.543]  You know what you're talking about, Ralph.
[03:04:49.563 --> 03:04:50.864]  You gotta promise to call back.
[03:04:51.264 --> 03:04:52.926]  I wish people like Ralph would have a YouTube channel.
[03:04:53.326 --> 03:04:54.967]  Because, I mean, what he's talking about is really accurate.
[03:04:55.368 --> 03:04:56.329]  And then we gotta cut him off.
[03:04:57.109 --> 03:04:57.730]  I promise.
[03:04:58.110 --> 03:04:59.852]  Or CJ can punch me in the nose.
[03:05:00.332 --> 03:05:01.213]  He doesn't want to, though.
[03:05:01.753 --> 03:05:03.194]  I'm gonna take a bunch of calls tomorrow.
[03:05:03.214 --> 03:05:03.975]  We did okay today.
[03:05:04.175 --> 03:05:05.016]  Good show overall.
[03:05:05.036 --> 03:05:06.757]  But tomorrow, I'm taking a bunch of your calls.
[03:05:06.777 --> 03:05:07.338]  I'm out of time.
[03:05:10.140 --> 03:05:14.684]  The knowledge of the... When you're out on the road, the last
