[00:00:07.435 --> 00:00:13.438]  For Tevis Junior High Vice Principal Kent Williams, bringing a concealed handgun to work was a simple choice.
[00:00:13.838 --> 00:00:16.159]  Someone had called the district to report the gun.
[00:00:16.319 --> 00:00:21.762]  The 51-year-old was arrested for potentially violating the California Gun-Free School Zone Act.
[00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:28.765]  But just hours later, the administrator was released after BPD said he didn't break any laws because of his permit.
[00:00:30.034 --> 00:00:34.216]  That's what we're referring to when we talk about the suppression of Second Amendment rights.
[00:00:34.696 --> 00:00:37.558]  A license-concealed carrier arrested for lawful carry.
[00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:41.400]  But the naysayers will bring up the Idaho professor that shot himself in the foot.
[00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:49.384]  And I will admit it wasn't the finest moment in the history of campus carry, but it's also not all-inclusive of the history of campus carry.
[00:00:49.704 --> 00:00:53.466]  Consider the story of Harold Isd and their superintendent, David Thweet.
[00:00:54.875 --> 00:01:01.698]  Every one of the plans in the United States in schools, emergency plans, are to lock the doors and hide the kids.
[00:01:02.238 --> 00:01:05.879]  Well, that was disturbing to us because we're 30 minutes from law enforcement.
[00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:11.861]  We had no way to protect ourselves and there wasn't anybody around to take care of us.
[00:01:11.921 --> 00:01:13.322]  We were our first responders.
[00:01:13.502 --> 00:01:13.682]  Right.
[00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:17.765]  I came up with a plan, and the plan has been on the news a lot.
[00:01:17.785 --> 00:01:19.687]  It's pretty self-explanatory.
[00:01:20.067 --> 00:01:21.268]  They have to have a CHL.
[00:01:21.808 --> 00:01:22.889]  We approve them.
[00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.251]  The board approves them individually.
[00:01:25.691 --> 00:01:33.958]  We undergo some extra training, and then we use frangible ammunition, which breaks apart when it hits hard objects, to avoid ricochet.
[00:01:34.238 --> 00:01:36.200]  But the advantage of our plan is
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.888]  Is that we have multiple people within the school, within the building, that can respond.
[00:01:43.148 --> 00:01:44.009]  We don't just have one.
[00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.574]  You know, every plan out there is a security guard.
[00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.356]  Well, what happens when he goes to the dentist?
[00:01:49.376 --> 00:01:50.618]  What happens when he has the flu?
[00:01:51.339 --> 00:01:53.922]  What happens when he goes to lunch, for crying out loud?
[00:01:55.165 --> 00:01:58.628]  That school has operated with a pro-gun stance for years without incident.
[00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:08.618]  So if your solution to campus violence is to sit back and wait for the police to come and save you, consider that the officers responding may not be any better trained with firearms than anyone else.

[00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:19.268]  50 cent, too short, all of them talk about block 40.
[00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:24.503]  Okay, I'm the only one in this room who confesses enough and I know I'll be carried to the block for it.
[00:02:24.964 --> 00:02:26.125]  I'm the only one.
