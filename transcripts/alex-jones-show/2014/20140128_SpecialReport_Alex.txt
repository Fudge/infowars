[00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:27.082]  And we've got up on screen, up on screen for TV viewers right now, C-SPAN with State of the Union coverage, and they've been groveling for a good hour right now, talking about the gracious leader, the dear leader, Kim Jong-un, I mean, Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:00:28.062 --> 00:00:46.337]  Who is about to come out and then drive in his armored limousine with armed guards protecting him across the street over to the Capitol where he will address a joint group of the House and Senate who will then engage in copious clapping.
[00:00:47.017 --> 00:01:02.648]  And if anyone dares say that he's a liar during Ball Face Lies, they will be exposed and demonized and lied about and censured for saying that Obama is indeed a big fat dictator.
[00:01:03.148 --> 00:01:05.470]  Now the establishment wants a dictatorship.
[00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.091]  Doesn't mean Obama will stay in office.
[00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:11.997]  But they want the presidency to be unilateral and be able to get away with whatever it wants.
[00:01:12.037 --> 00:01:18.626]  And here's the Associated Press today that came out just hours ago with the first leak of the speech saying,
[00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.703]  For more American families, that's what I'm going to do.
[00:01:28.624 --> 00:01:30.406]  Dictators never say I'm an evil liar.
[00:01:30.426 --> 00:01:31.588]  They say it's for you.
[00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.392]  And if it'll just give me dictatorial power, I'll take care of you.
[00:01:35.813 --> 00:01:39.076]  Now, Ted Cruz has come out in the Wall Street Journal just minutes ago.
[00:01:39.657 --> 00:01:40.318]  It's 7.36, 29 seconds right now.
[00:01:44.291 --> 00:01:46.593]  826 or 836 Eastern Time.
[00:01:47.014 --> 00:01:55.020]  We are live, unscripted, no teleprompters, right now, just toe-to-toe, bare knuckles, with the crime syndicate that seized America.
[00:01:55.341 --> 00:01:56.121]  It's bipartisan.
[00:01:56.562 --> 00:02:02.326]  And Ted Cruz says, the imperial presidency of Barack Obama.
[00:02:03.628 --> 00:02:10.934]  In the nation's history, there is simply no precedent for an American president so wantonly ignoring federal law.
[00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:24.620]  Oh yeah, he violates the entire federal law on immigration, on sovereignty, on war, on power plants, on carbon, on Obamacare, on NDAA.
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.001]  He does whatever he wants.
[00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:31.545]  And he says we're not going to make churches pay for abortions or birth control in a state of the union five years ago.
[00:02:31.806 --> 00:02:32.446]  That was a lie.
[00:02:32.987 --> 00:02:35.028]  And if you've got your doctor, you can keep him.
[00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:36.569]  Or I won't go after your guns.
[00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.853]  This is the reality, and it's the season we're in at the end of this hundred-year Federal Reserve bubble.
[00:02:43.714 --> 00:02:47.096]  Now, for the next five, six, seven minutes, we've got David Knight in studio with us.
[00:02:47.416 --> 00:02:52.939]  He'll be back with live commentary during the State of the Union, like Mystery Science Theater.
[00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:54.280]  He's bypassed Congress.
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.603]  We're bypassing his BS to live while he's on screen during the stage-canned applause to counter it.
[00:03:01.284 --> 00:03:02.905]  But David Knight's here to talk about this.
[00:03:02.925 --> 00:03:04.826]  We were watching, David, on
[00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.730]  The White House.
[00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:24.390]  I mean, we didn't get ready for this.
[00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.470]  We just have the research.
[00:03:25.951 --> 00:03:27.271]  We're here telling the truth.
[00:03:27.871 --> 00:03:29.432]  What is it like?
[00:03:29.832 --> 00:03:43.259]  Is it as surreal for you, David Knight, reporter from Forbes Nightly News, if you just tuned in for the first time, is it surreal for you as it is for me to be living something out of history, Julius Caesar, Adolf Hitler?
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.760]  I mean, it's really happening.
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.584]  And it's the corporate media is going, well, he is kind of a dictator, like the Christian Science Monitor says.
[00:03:52.344 --> 00:03:54.025]  But it's a good dictator.
[00:03:54.065 --> 00:03:57.787]  I mean, we kind of need an Emperor Palpatine to save us.
[00:03:58.628 --> 00:04:04.011]  Well, yesterday I was amazed to see this phrase that he's going to assert his unilateral agenda.
[00:04:04.491 --> 00:04:06.573]  And it's like, in other words, he's going to be a dictator.
[00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:08.134]  He's going to assert his dictatorship.
[00:04:08.714 --> 00:04:12.436]  And I did a Google search of it and you see headline after headline after headline.
[00:04:12.616 --> 00:04:13.677]  It became a talking point for
[00:04:13.677 --> 00:04:13.957]  I don't know.
[00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:44.874]  Julius Caesar increased the dole, or the minimum wage, but only for votes in Rome to control the city itself.
[00:04:45.194 --> 00:04:47.856]  He was a dictator, but still the city was controlled by Roman citizens.
[00:04:48.197 --> 00:04:51.759]  And a vote, that's where all this comes from, 2,050-something years ago.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.781]  So he knows there's hyperinflation.
[00:04:53.801 --> 00:04:55.502]  He knows you can't live on $7 an hour.
[00:04:55.702 --> 00:04:55.982]  Oh yeah.
[00:04:56.343 --> 00:04:57.123]  Or whatever it is.
[00:04:57.143 --> 00:04:59.405]  So he says, I'll make it $10.
[00:04:59.725 --> 00:05:02.047]  So he takes away with one hand, gives back with another.
[00:05:02.307 --> 00:05:03.088]  But it's not even that.
[00:05:03.148 --> 00:05:08.092]  He's lying about that because it's only on new contracts, new federal contracts he's going to raise it for.
[00:05:08.232 --> 00:05:09.092]  That's right.
[00:05:09.112 --> 00:05:12.955]  So, he comes out to his constituency that wants a higher minimum wage because they think that's going to help them.
[00:05:12.975 --> 00:05:14.637]  Knowing they're going to call for it like Obamacare.
[00:05:14.837 --> 00:05:15.017]  Exactly.
[00:05:15.037 --> 00:05:18.560]  They pass Obamacare, then he says, oh, make me a dictator, I'll fix it.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.242]  Or, oh, I thought minimum wage, but they stopped me.
[00:05:21.802 --> 00:05:23.103]  They think they're going to get the free deal.
[00:05:23.364 --> 00:05:24.725]  Make me a dictator, I'll give it to you.
[00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:34.677]  Meanwhile, last year, in his State of the Union Address, he talked about the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is going to eviscerate the working poor, unlike anything they've ever seen before.
[00:05:34.937 --> 00:05:41.944]  So he's sending their jobs away, he's going to unilaterally triple immigration, which is going to increase the competition at the lower wages.
[00:05:42.084 --> 00:05:42.644]  That's racist.
[00:05:42.724 --> 00:05:44.106]  Don't talk bad about him.
[00:05:44.626 --> 00:05:47.889]  He said two weeks ago, racism is why he's unpopular.
[00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.829]  Right, that's right.
[00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:50.070]  Now, will you please stop being racist?
[00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.431]  People just discovered that he's black.
[00:05:51.811 --> 00:06:03.237]  But, you know, he's got Obamacare, which put in new mandates when employers hits the people at the bottom of the working scale the hardest, because they're now defined as being full-time if they just work 30 hours, so it makes them a lot more expensive.
[00:06:03.297 --> 00:06:08.139]  So they're going to be inclined to hire illegal aliens at the bottom of the pay wage.
[00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:09.179]  All these different things.
[00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:11.861]  Well, that's why the Republican leadership is for the open borders.
[00:06:12.061 --> 00:06:12.221]  Right.
[00:06:12.361 --> 00:06:15.883]  All these Democrats ought to think, why are all the big corporate groups for this?
[00:06:16.443 --> 00:06:18.484]  Because it's going to sell you down the river, idiots.
[00:06:18.924 --> 00:06:26.766]  He's like dumping arsenic in their food and then giving them this little sugar high of the minimum wage increase, which is going to only last a short period of time.
[00:06:27.166 --> 00:06:27.947]  It's going to be eaten up.
[00:06:27.987 --> 00:06:29.987]  It's going to move through all the rest of the economy.
[00:06:30.027 --> 00:06:31.908]  They're still going to be at the bottom of the economy.
[00:06:32.128 --> 00:06:34.168]  They're still not going to be raising the standard of living.
[00:06:34.188 --> 00:06:35.949]  Let me economically explain why they've done that.
[00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:41.971]  If they can keep inflation only in the ultra elite, they can give themselves unlimited Federal Reserve fiat.
[00:06:42.651 --> 00:06:43.191]  Trillions.
[00:06:43.671 --> 00:06:46.513]  But if they ever let it trickle down, it'll cause hyperinflation.
[00:06:47.133 --> 00:06:48.454]  So this is a desperate move.
[00:06:48.514 --> 00:06:50.895]  Well, and he wants to index it to inflation.
[00:06:51.235 --> 00:06:53.796]  And if you do that, like you're talking about, it is going to cause hyperinflation.
[00:06:53.816 --> 00:06:54.836]  It's going to cause a spiral.
[00:06:55.137 --> 00:07:01.980]  And it's going to be a death spiral for the economy if they do that sort of thing, because the minimum wage always trickles throughout the entire economy.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.200]  But I don't need to intellectually listen to you, David.
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:04.741]  You're racist.
[00:07:05.578 --> 00:07:05.758]  Yeah.
[00:07:05.998 --> 00:07:10.361]  Well, you know, the amazing thing is, four years ago, Joe Wilson said, you're a liar.
[00:07:10.661 --> 00:07:11.541]  Shouted out, you lie.
[00:07:11.941 --> 00:07:15.683]  It was a great moment because you had kind of this impromptu back and forth.
[00:07:15.723 --> 00:07:18.785]  He just, just burst out because he is lying over and over again.
[00:07:18.825 --> 00:07:21.827]  What's really interesting is to look at his previous State of the Union addresses.
[00:07:21.867 --> 00:07:23.928]  That's why I printed out his previous State of the Union addresses.
[00:07:23.948 --> 00:07:24.488]  You've got them right here.
[00:07:24.528 --> 00:07:24.748]  Yeah.
[00:07:24.788 --> 00:07:27.690]  Looked at all these different things, all the different lies that he's had throughout the years.
[00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:31.472]  And in that little clip, that 38 second clip, let's play that clip.
[00:07:31.892 --> 00:07:32.533]  You guys got that clip?
[00:07:32.553 --> 00:07:37.076]  Yeah, we've got this clip of the congressman that got censured talking about the dear Fuhrer.
[00:07:37.116 --> 00:07:39.839]  Let's roll that live right now here on air.
[00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:43.642]  While we're getting it, it is 742 and 30 seconds.
[00:07:44.242 --> 00:07:45.984]  Give me a thumbs up as soon as you got it, guys.
[00:07:46.164 --> 00:07:48.066]  What they were doing was they were talking about whether...
[00:07:48.686 --> 00:07:49.487]  We're good to go.
[00:08:10.968 --> 00:08:12.708]  Well, they're also going after the Catholic Church.
[00:08:31.033 --> 00:08:34.718]  The bottom line here is, we told the truth about all this.
[00:08:34.778 --> 00:08:34.958]  Yes.
[00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:38.083]  You can read the legislation, you can see what they were promoting.
[00:08:38.403 --> 00:08:40.746]  They were advertising we're going to give illegals free health care.
[00:08:41.067 --> 00:08:43.770]  They were advertising we're going to make the Catholic Church pay for abortions.
[00:08:44.271 --> 00:08:46.734]  And so the guy said, Joe Wilson, you lie!
[00:08:46.754 --> 00:08:47.175]  Yeah.
[00:08:47.415 --> 00:08:58.561]  And that was the ultimate sin, is to say the emperor wears no clothes, kind of like Ted Cruz was on Face the Nation and said Obama's becoming a dictator, he's arresting members of the press, Dinesh D'Souza, this is dangerous.
[00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:02.583]  That went out on the internet feed, an hour later when the show aired, they cut it.
[00:09:02.623 --> 00:09:03.784]  That's right, that's right.
[00:09:04.424 --> 00:09:10.087]  And it's true, it sounds radical when we break with decorum and say this is tyranny or Ted Cruz does it.
[00:09:11.408 --> 00:09:17.590]  If your house is burning and you, or your neighbor's house is burning and you go beat on the door and say your house is on fire, you're not being a fear monger.
[00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:18.110]  Right.
[00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:19.591]  I mean, the house is on fire.
[00:09:19.711 --> 00:09:20.051]  That's right.
[00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:22.132]  So, so there's this delusional idea.
[00:09:22.192 --> 00:09:23.212]  We do have the clip now.
[00:09:23.512 --> 00:09:25.913]  Again, we're live folks, have some computer crashes occasionally.
[00:09:26.253 --> 00:09:32.355]  We have the Joe Wilson response in the media when he dared commit sacrilege five years ago.
[00:09:32.435 --> 00:09:32.895]  Here it is.
[00:09:33.475 --> 00:09:37.277]  There are also those who claim that our reform efforts would ensure illegal immigrants.
[00:09:38.997 --> 00:09:40.498]  This too is false.
[00:09:41.687 --> 00:09:47.451]  The reforms I'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally.
[00:09:54.515 --> 00:09:57.817]  And one more misunderstanding I want to clear up.
[00:09:59.038 --> 00:10:06.883]  Under our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions, and federal conscience laws will remain in place.
[00:10:10.809 --> 00:10:13.112]  I want to stop right there and explain what's happening.
[00:10:14.193 --> 00:10:17.056]  It's like when Ted Cruz came out and gave a 28-hour filibuster.
[00:10:17.296 --> 00:10:18.237]  Incredible job.
[00:10:19.118 --> 00:10:23.202]  They went, oh, he's discredited when Obamacare fell apart.
[00:10:24.158 --> 00:10:25.479]  When he'd actually been empowered.
[00:10:25.519 --> 00:10:27.361]  They went, oh, it's over for him.
[00:10:27.681 --> 00:10:28.522]  It's the same deal.
[00:10:29.663 --> 00:10:35.269]  You see Biden, you see Pelosi acting like, this is outrageous that he would dare say you lie.
[00:10:35.589 --> 00:10:36.870]  They had the bill at the time.
[00:10:37.211 --> 00:10:38.051]  It did all that.
[00:10:38.111 --> 00:10:38.332]  Yes.
[00:10:38.492 --> 00:10:45.298]  But they were counting on viewers who don't know, don't know how to go look up bills, just believing that they acted more confident.
[00:10:45.959 --> 00:10:46.881]  It's a pure con game.
[00:10:47.141 --> 00:10:50.146]  And that's what's so frustrating about this, is they want to make him poor.
[00:10:50.186 --> 00:10:51.148]  They want to bankrupt him.
[00:10:51.528 --> 00:10:52.670]  They're lying openly.
[00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.553]  Since then, he's been caught in all these lies.
[00:10:54.994 --> 00:10:58.780]  And he's going back to the well, back to the thing one more time to try to manipulate people.
[00:10:59.497 --> 00:11:07.960]  One last thing I want to say, and remember we had about a month ago, everybody learned that volunteer fire departments across the country were going to be shut down because of Obamacare.
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.141]  They were going to force them to pay for Obamacare even though these firemen were volunteer.
[00:11:12.621 --> 00:11:15.102]  Now this is from his State of the Union speech last year.
[00:11:15.122 --> 00:11:23.885]  He said, we won't grow the middle class simply by shifting the cost of health care onto families are already struggling or forcing communities to lay off more teachers, cops, and firefighters.
[00:11:24.505 --> 00:11:31.988]  Now they had to walk that back on January the 10th to give firefighters an exemption from the Obama Affordable Health Care.
[00:11:32.568 --> 00:11:37.029]  And again, they didn't do that with Congress, it's executive orders that they run this stuff through.
[00:11:37.209 --> 00:11:47.713]  So even his own law, he's been acting unilaterally to assert his agenda, and they realize time after time that they have to give exemptions to people or they will destroy that group.
[00:11:47.773 --> 00:11:53.375]  So whenever you've got a vocal group that organizes and says, look what Obamacare is doing to us, they give them an exemption.
[00:11:53.755 --> 00:11:58.478]  And it's trying to keep the people who are really protesting it quiet, just like John Corbett getting a free pass from the TSA.
[00:12:10.845 --> 00:12:11.906]  Because he's their biggest critic.
[00:12:11.946 --> 00:12:13.066]  We saw people like Conrad saying it.
[00:12:13.086 --> 00:12:14.107]  We're going to go to a quick break.
[00:12:14.127 --> 00:12:18.490]  We're going to come back with Jakari Jackson and Leigh-Anne McAdoo for 10 minutes because Obama's running a bit late.
[00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:22.393]  Then we're going to cover, all of us in here together, Mystery Science Theater style.
[00:12:22.693 --> 00:12:27.416]  While he's on that screen right behind you, we're going to be countering what he says in live time.
[00:12:27.436 --> 00:12:31.879]  Then you'll all come back after I'm gone to break down all this research David Knight did.
[00:12:32.259 --> 00:12:34.341]  I gotta have you back on the radio tomorrow to break all this down.
[00:12:34.681 --> 00:12:38.244]  Okay, we're gonna go to break and come right back with Jakari Jackson and Leanne McAdoo.
[00:12:38.544 --> 00:12:43.909]  We're covering the state of the dictatorship, the state of the would-be dictator, Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:12:44.249 --> 00:12:44.830]  Stay with us.
[00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:51.335]  This is real, live, uncensored, teleprompter-free, powered by liberty, powered by a heart that loves freedom.
[00:12:51.355 --> 00:12:51.936]  We'll be right back.
[00:13:02.779 --> 00:13:07.522]  The bad news is Obama is officially becoming a dictator.
[00:13:08.283 --> 00:13:14.907]  The good news is the people of the United States and the world are beginning to wake up and get concerned.
[00:13:15.687 --> 00:13:19.030]  Obama is going to give his State of the Union address tonight.
[00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:30.612]  And we're going to have live coverage 7 o'clock central at Infowarsnews.com and Infowars.com of the lead up to this historic address.
[00:13:31.172 --> 00:13:38.974]  Then I'm going to be covering it live during the applause and giving my commentary and analysis on the fly.
[00:13:39.674 --> 00:13:47.976]  Obama has said that he's going to sell the idea of a unitary executive acting alone in a power grab tonight.
[00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:53.938]  This is going to be like Emperor Palpatine's speech where he talks about the first galactic empire.
[00:13:54.538 --> 00:13:57.680]  And so this is how freedom dies with thunderous applause.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:05.643]  We're going to be covering this historic speech live tonight in more than a two hour transmission before
[00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:07.951]  During and after.
[00:14:08.191 --> 00:14:09.692]  And not just myself, Alex Jones.
[00:14:10.093 --> 00:14:19.700]  We're going to have Jakari Jackson, David Knight, Leanne McAdoo, and more with the great InfoWars team tonight, coming up 7 o'clock central.
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:29.487]  If you're not a PrisonPlanet.tv member or an InfoWarsNews.com member, you'll be able to find the free feed at InfoWars.com forward slash show as well.
[00:14:30.007 --> 00:14:34.511]  It's important that all of us speak out against this attempt to take over our nation.
[00:14:35.111 --> 00:14:36.432]  And this is just in.
[00:14:36.912 --> 00:14:43.895]  Footage of Obama today with a group of his supporters practicing tonight's speech.
[00:14:44.276 --> 00:14:50.879]  So I leave you with this exclusive of Inside Obama practicing for his State of the Union.
[00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:06.374]  Hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems.
[00:15:07.135 --> 00:15:15.359]  They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.
[00:15:27.637 --> 00:15:28.638]  You should reject these voices.
[00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:36.805]  Because what they suggest is that our brave and creative and unique experiment in self-rule is somehow just a sham.
[00:15:37.786 --> 00:15:44.912]  It is only fitting that a free scream should sound the alarm against those who would destroy.
[00:15:44.972 --> 00:15:48.716]  We have never been a people who place all of our faith in government to solve our problems.
[00:15:49.376 --> 00:15:50.117]  We shouldn't want to.
[00:15:51.098 --> 00:15:53.620]  The motion picture has no equal.
[00:15:57.233 --> 00:16:04.476]  Join us tonight, 7 o'clock central, at PrisonPlanet.tv or at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:16:04.896 --> 00:16:08.878]  And remember, if you're watching this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:16:09.438 --> 00:16:17.141]  The Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire!
[00:16:17.401 --> 00:16:24.384]  For a safe and secure society!
[00:16:26.647 --> 00:16:27.469]  So this is how Liberty dies.
[00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:28.170]  With a nurse applause.
[00:16:56.536 --> 00:17:01.087]  Now you can watch the InfoWars Nightly News streaming live as it happens for free.
[00:17:01.588 --> 00:17:04.796]  Check it out at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:17:16.946 --> 00:17:32.759]  A true revolutionary radio slash TV here on the InfoWars Nightly News, teleprompter free with real reporters, real analysis, or a real crew doing a great job up here working now for about 14 hours with my radio show today and now the TV show, the news, and the live coverage.
[00:17:32.799 --> 00:17:38.945]  We're doing the best we can and I want to thank all of you that are PrisonPlanet.TV subscribers for making this possible.
[00:17:38.985 --> 00:17:39.946]  We couldn't do it without you.
[00:17:40.566 --> 00:17:42.168]  Now Obama's a few minutes behind.
[00:17:42.348 --> 00:17:45.431]  Hitler always did that, building up his nighttime speeches.
[00:17:46.272 --> 00:17:48.114]  So we'll be going to him in about 10 minutes.
[00:17:48.494 --> 00:17:50.717]  In fact, let's punch up the C-SPAN feed we've got.
[00:17:51.458 --> 00:17:55.342]  They're milling around in the District of Criminals Congress building.
[00:17:56.658 --> 00:18:04.345]  As you can see there on screen, we'll leave some of that ambient background noise there for everybody preparing for this.
[00:18:04.405 --> 00:18:07.167]  But, Jakari Jackson, Lee Ann McAdoo are here.
[00:18:07.508 --> 00:18:09.129]  Jakari, you've been here a year now.
[00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:19.499]  What is it like for you, you were already informed when we hired you in the reporters contest, but what is it like for you to be in the middle of this, immersed in it, 10 to 15 hours a day?
[00:18:19.899 --> 00:18:21.640]  What is it like to see this unfolding?
[00:18:22.522 --> 00:18:26.633]  Or do you think it's not an issue that Obama says he can act unilaterally across the board?
[00:18:27.193 --> 00:18:40.023]  Not very much is it, Alex, because I remember one of my submissions for the reporter contest, I talked about the NDAA, you know, the National Offensive Authorization Act, which he signed at midnight, hoping that people wouldn't notice it, and just to see all the things that came after that.
[00:18:40.043 --> 00:18:41.585]  You know, I was hoping, you know, that would be the biggest thing.
[00:18:41.605 --> 00:18:45.588]  You know, he'll do that, that'll be his peak, that'll be his apex, and then it will all go down from there.
[00:18:45.608 --> 00:18:47.089]  It's been the exact opposite.
[00:18:47.389 --> 00:18:56.657]  He hit that and just, he hit his stride and he went straight on with more tyranny, more phone checks, more lying to old Obama phone ladies, lying to everybody.
[00:18:57.017 --> 00:19:00.399]  That's what he's been doing, Alex, and it's very disheartening to see that he continues like that.
[00:19:00.419 --> 00:19:01.820]  And again, Obama is a puppet.
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.722]  It's the power structure behind him, but regardless, he's their quarterback.
[00:19:05.082 --> 00:19:12.567]  So we have to point it out, if his cult continues on exactly like Hitler or Stalin or anybody, he's just being given the power.
[00:19:12.687 --> 00:19:13.467]  Given the power.
[00:19:14.008 --> 00:19:14.908]  What does your gut tell you?
[00:19:14.948 --> 00:19:15.609]  Where is this going?
[00:19:16.189 --> 00:19:17.029]  It's not going well.
[00:19:17.129 --> 00:19:18.410]  Just like you said, he is a puppet.
[00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.930]  Because I hear people say all the time, let's impeach Obama.
[00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:22.811]  And I don't think that's necessarily a bad idea.
[00:19:23.031 --> 00:19:28.912]  But if we don't get rid of the power structure that allows guys like him to operate, Bush, Clinton, whoever else, whoever may be next.
[00:19:28.952 --> 00:19:33.553]  If we don't get rid of this power structure, the next puppet will just come in and take his place and do the exact same things.
[00:19:34.013 --> 00:19:34.473]  Exactly.
[00:19:34.533 --> 00:19:38.634]  It shows how just each president gets worse because the power structure is more arrogant.
[00:19:38.654 --> 00:19:42.635]  But if he sets all these precedents now to get away with this, think of the next guy.
[00:19:42.975 --> 00:19:45.556]  Leanne McAdoo, what's it like for you working here eight, nine months?
[00:19:46.598 --> 00:19:49.519]  Well, for me, it's just been pretty extreme.
[00:19:50.079 --> 00:19:55.762]  You know, not working here, I can kind of take myself out of the equation and turn off the State of the Union address last year.
[00:19:55.802 --> 00:19:56.702]  I don't have to watch it.
[00:19:57.122 --> 00:20:02.885]  But here now, it's my job to just see how fast they're really ramping up their efforts to turn this thing on.
[00:20:02.925 --> 00:20:05.006]  And it is because people are waking up now.
[00:20:05.066 --> 00:20:07.667]  They're starting to realize that this is a big show.
[00:20:08.567 --> 00:20:13.188]  And that, you know, we don't want to be distracted anymore, so we see their efforts really turning on.
[00:20:13.228 --> 00:20:18.329]  I think that's why Obama's warming up to using executive action.
[00:20:18.489 --> 00:20:19.630]  Oh look, Boehner!
[00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:25.051]  Boehner's saying the joint session will come to order.
[00:20:25.071 --> 00:20:30.132]  Members of the committee on the part of the House will escort the President of the United States into the chamber.
[00:20:30.172 --> 00:20:32.213]  Alright, they're going to do this whole rigmarole.
[00:20:33.183 --> 00:20:34.903]  And you can at least tell in the background.
[00:20:35.584 --> 00:20:36.704]  Here's the great distraction.
[00:20:37.144 --> 00:20:39.864]  They are acting like Obama is in control.
[00:20:41.905 --> 00:20:44.645]  The last president was in somewhat controllable skin and they blew his head off.
[00:20:45.426 --> 00:20:47.646]  Eisenhower stood up against them, spoke out.
[00:20:47.906 --> 00:20:48.886]  Others spoke out against them.
[00:20:49.326 --> 00:20:52.767]  They've assassinated other presidents who spoke out against special interests.
[00:20:53.867 --> 00:20:56.588]  And the rest of these guys are intimidated and controlled as well.
[00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:02.394]  So, they want to make it look like Obama's running everything, so he gets the blame in the end for all the stuff they've done.
[00:21:02.514 --> 00:21:04.095]  Well, then why are we going after Obama?
[00:21:04.475 --> 00:21:05.456]  Well, it's a double-edged sword.
[00:21:05.776 --> 00:21:10.160]  He is their front guy, so you bring him down early, you bring down their agenda.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:14.563]  We don't want to hear him discredited like Clinton after he leaves, and then built back up later.
[00:21:14.803 --> 00:21:15.103]  Right.
[00:21:15.123 --> 00:21:17.105]  No, no, we want him discredited now.
[00:21:17.425 --> 00:21:19.927]  We want investigations now to stall the agenda.
[00:21:20.107 --> 00:21:22.009]  They don't care if we learn about him later.
[00:21:23.191 --> 00:21:26.313]  Well, Alex, you know he is discredited now because he has low approval ratings.
[00:21:26.353 --> 00:21:28.114]  Nobody wants to hear what this guy has to say anymore.
[00:21:28.374 --> 00:21:35.598]  Even his backers, you know, like my mom, she voted for Obama, you know, this recent election, but now she's trying to back off a little bit because she's, you know, she's from Oklahoma.
[00:21:35.618 --> 00:21:36.719]  She's like, yeah, I want my guns.
[00:21:36.739 --> 00:21:39.200]  I don't want to give up my gun for Barack Obama.
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.962]  Is he going to come protect me until my breaks in my house at three in the morning?
[00:21:42.322 --> 00:21:58.415]  And these incremental steps, because he keeps hitting somebody at some level, whether it's gay marriage, or abortion, or guns, or whatever your issue may be, and I'm not saying any of those things are particularly bad or horrible, but just whatever your issue may be, once he crosses that threshold, Alex, that's when people wake up to it.
[00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:00.330]  That's right.
[00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:01.851]  But I mean, it's the betrayals.
[00:22:01.911 --> 00:22:07.052]  They're training us to accept betrayals and Clinton, Bush, now Obama.
[00:22:07.992 --> 00:22:10.073]  And they're just whole hog going after everybody.
[00:22:10.113 --> 00:22:12.714]  And then look at these pimps on TV.
[00:22:13.274 --> 00:22:15.635]  I mean, a lot of the Republicans say, oh, let him be unpopular.
[00:22:15.815 --> 00:22:16.755]  We'll get elected later.
[00:22:17.315 --> 00:22:19.056]  So they can then do the same thing again?
[00:22:19.116 --> 00:22:19.316]  No.
[00:22:20.296 --> 00:22:23.577]  Anybody that looks at this can see this is unhealthy for the entire system.
[00:22:24.181 --> 00:22:30.846]  Right, well they rolled out a spokesperson on CNN or MSNBC, you know, a few months ago to say, everybody, all the presidents lie.
[00:22:30.866 --> 00:22:35.130]  I mean, we just have to decide how much of the lies are we going to be okay with.
[00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:38.252]  And just kind of like warming us all up to being able to protect.
[00:22:38.272 --> 00:22:41.915]  Maybe one thing if a president lied about assassinating some spy or something they could prove.
[00:22:41.955 --> 00:22:45.738]  But when you're like, I'm going to cut your health insurance in half and then it triples.
[00:22:46.338 --> 00:22:47.959]  Or, don't worry, I'm not going to come after your guns.
[00:22:48.019 --> 00:22:48.379]  None of them.
[00:22:48.419 --> 00:22:49.140]  And he comes after them.
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.441]  Or, don't worry, I'm not going to give illegals free insurance.
[00:22:51.501 --> 00:22:52.202]  And he's doing it.
[00:22:52.542 --> 00:22:54.643]  Don't worry, I'm not going to make the Catholic Church pay for abortions.
[00:22:54.683 --> 00:22:55.063]  He does it.
[00:22:55.083 --> 00:22:56.284]  I'm going to shut down Guantanamo.
[00:22:56.564 --> 00:22:57.385]  And then expands it.
[00:22:57.425 --> 00:22:58.345]  I mean, exactly.
[00:22:58.405 --> 00:23:01.567]  It's every... Or, I'm not going to sign the NDAA.
[00:23:01.607 --> 00:23:02.107]  And he wrote it.
[00:23:03.068 --> 00:23:04.089]  We signed the Patriot Act.
[00:23:04.289 --> 00:23:04.569]  All that.
[00:23:05.939 --> 00:23:08.742]  Yeah, I mean it is our peace prize funding Al-Qaeda.
[00:23:09.763 --> 00:23:14.948]  And then just look at all these, it's a bunch of wannabe, if you're watching this on C-SPAN, let's punch them up for everybody.
[00:23:15.368 --> 00:23:16.650]  Look at these narcissists.
[00:23:17.934 --> 00:23:23.197]  It's all about how they're stars and they want to be on red carpets and they want to land in all these jets.
[00:23:24.137 --> 00:23:27.639]  And folks, look, I'm somebody who's been in big movies and doesn't want to be in more.
[00:23:28.059 --> 00:23:29.780]  I'm somebody that's actually had big success.
[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:31.701]  I can tell you it's empty and means nothing.
[00:23:32.242 --> 00:23:34.483]  But I've been around a lot of big politicians and corporate people.
[00:23:34.763 --> 00:23:38.225]  They will fall down on their knees in front of a B-level actor.
[00:23:39.204 --> 00:23:40.725]  I've seen him in front of A-list actors.
[00:23:40.925 --> 00:23:41.726]  Literally U.S.
[00:23:41.746 --> 00:23:44.027]  Senators grovel at parties I've been at.
[00:23:44.548 --> 00:23:46.369]  And I'm saying they're not fit to leave, folks.
[00:23:46.389 --> 00:23:47.370]  They're not knightly.
[00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:48.851]  They're not honorable.
[00:23:49.251 --> 00:23:51.233]  They are literally on power trips.
[00:23:51.253 --> 00:23:52.513]  They're not into being good people.
[00:23:52.814 --> 00:23:54.635]  They're into being narcissists.
[00:23:54.695 --> 00:24:02.480]  All they care about is this giant exercise in acting like they're good people when they're screwing everybody.
[00:24:02.981 --> 00:24:05.523]  Jokari, we're about to go to the Fuhrer entering the area.
[00:24:05.903 --> 00:24:08.425]  Liam, we're about to get to Kim Jong-un entering the area.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:13.025]  Closing comments each on this before we go and bring David Knight in.
[00:24:13.046 --> 00:24:20.717]  Before we turn the television, turn towards it, and before we begin addressing the man they would make dictator.
[00:24:21.317 --> 00:24:24.319]  Well, I just want everybody to pay attention because this is the time to do it.
[00:24:24.359 --> 00:24:26.620]  You know, you don't have to wait for the next election cycle.
[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:30.482]  If you're fed up with the way things are, if you're fed up with the way things have been, this is the time.
[00:24:30.762 --> 00:24:32.563]  You know, this is the time to get into the arena.
[00:24:32.583 --> 00:24:34.063]  This is the time to get active.
[00:24:34.103 --> 00:24:34.564]  Call your friends.
[00:24:34.604 --> 00:24:35.744]  Call your friends and family right now.
[00:24:35.764 --> 00:24:42.388]  Tell them to tune in and get real coverage of this thing, not the glossed over, oh, he was wearing such a nice tie or doesn't he have such a nice haircut.
[00:24:42.648 --> 00:24:46.130]  Not any of that crap, but the real news about the real issues that are going on in the U.S.
[00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:46.510]  right now.
[00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:48.161]  Right.
[00:24:48.181 --> 00:24:53.929]  If you want to know how much of a fool they think you are, just look at the whitehouse.gov website right now.
[00:24:53.989 --> 00:24:57.193]  It's showing the president putting on makeup and preparing to be the actor Obama.
[00:24:57.213 --> 00:24:58.234]  And looking at the camera.
[00:24:58.294 --> 00:24:59.236]  Looking at the screen.
[00:24:59.256 --> 00:25:00.277]  We've got to do a report on that.
[00:25:00.317 --> 00:25:00.497]  Yeah.
[00:25:01.192 --> 00:25:02.233]  That is so discrediting.
[00:25:02.273 --> 00:25:03.193]  He's a method actor.
[00:25:03.453 --> 00:25:08.256]  Yeah, all the actors are there saying, oh, we love Obama and they've got like their little reality showing.
[00:25:08.376 --> 00:25:13.699]  Oh, a day at the White House, we're here, the puppets, you know, they're pulling our strings and this is what we do.
[00:25:13.779 --> 00:25:21.343]  And I mean, that's how Donald Trump... And then look, they bring in the traitorous Supreme Court that authorized Obamacare as a tax to foreign corporations.
[00:25:22.183 --> 00:25:25.125]  I mean, they bring in these traitors like they're movie stars.
[00:25:25.465 --> 00:25:26.766]  They're these damn peacocks.
[00:25:26.846 --> 00:25:27.166]  Go ahead.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.862]  I just can't with the clapping.
[00:25:29.963 --> 00:25:31.925]  I mean, last year it was 8 minutes long.
[00:25:32.125 --> 00:25:37.913]  So, ugh, that's just... The thunderous applause, that Star Wars line Alex, you always like to say.
[00:25:37.973 --> 00:25:40.537]  This is how the empire falls with all the applause.
[00:25:41.017 --> 00:25:42.539]  It is now 8 o'clock central.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:49.023]  And they are making everyone with bated breath prepare for the Fuhrer to enter, again, to make it look like he's running things.
[00:25:49.464 --> 00:25:53.506]  Again, the office that's been given dictatorial power is running things.
[00:25:53.906 --> 00:25:57.248]  The National Security Council, run by foreign banks, is running things.
[00:25:57.748 --> 00:25:59.890]  But Obama, the puppet, isn't.
[00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:04.792]  So again, they built him up as a dictator and as the guy doing it because he's disposable.
[00:26:05.153 --> 00:26:08.575]  It's so important to tear down Obama while pointing out
[00:26:09.295 --> 00:26:11.136]  That presidents have become puppets.
[00:26:11.736 --> 00:26:15.178]  But again, they are preparing with bated breath for the Fuhrer to enter.
[00:26:15.418 --> 00:26:22.781]  And he's supposed to get people back to the table to have hope in him again, so they won't revolt while they ram through the rest of the agenda.
[00:26:22.821 --> 00:26:23.161]  Leanne?
[00:26:23.421 --> 00:26:25.022]  Well, what do you think that he's gonna ask for?
[00:26:25.042 --> 00:26:26.983]  I think he's gonna call for more drones.
[00:26:27.918 --> 00:26:28.598]  Well, we know.
[00:26:28.758 --> 00:26:31.940]  I mean, he's going to say, I can fix things if you let me run everything.
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:33.441]  And there's been gridlock.
[00:26:33.941 --> 00:26:35.842]  Raising the debt ceiling doesn't raise the debt ceiling.
[00:26:35.962 --> 00:26:37.002]  I'm going to give you jobs.
[00:26:37.763 --> 00:26:39.524]  The idea of government's going to give me a job.
[00:26:40.404 --> 00:26:42.605]  Maybe in the Soviet Union, you see how well that worked?
[00:26:43.125 --> 00:26:45.406]  Don't give you a job working at the NSA.
[00:26:45.446 --> 00:26:46.187]  That's what they're going to do.
[00:26:46.227 --> 00:26:47.807]  They'll give you a job as a drone pilot.
[00:26:48.068 --> 00:26:49.508]  Those are going to be the new jobs in America.
[00:26:49.928 --> 00:26:53.310]  Because we look at all the job creation, a lot of these things are in the government.
[00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:55.451]  And that's until the robots replace you.
[00:26:55.691 --> 00:26:56.932]  What else do you think he's going to call for?
[00:26:57.812 --> 00:26:59.954]  I think Leanne had a real good point with the drones.
[00:26:59.994 --> 00:27:02.517]  More power, I think that's going to be the big thing regardless of anything.
[00:27:03.097 --> 00:27:06.040]  I can fix it if you just give me a little bit more time and a lot more power.
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:08.342]  I think that's going to be the main focus of the speech.
[00:27:08.582 --> 00:27:14.468]  Meanwhile, they're lobbying to shut down the power plants, to ship the jobs overseas, to sign new so-called free trade deals.
[00:27:15.129 --> 00:27:18.292]  Everything is about getting more people on food stamps, more people dependent.
[00:27:18.792 --> 00:27:19.973]  Yeah, and Obamacare, of course.
[00:27:20.254 --> 00:27:22.136]  Oh my gosh, the President's Cabinet!
[00:27:22.196 --> 00:27:23.377]  More rock stars!
[00:27:23.998 --> 00:27:26.380]  Oh my gosh, it's like the Grammys and the Oscars.
[00:27:26.741 --> 00:27:30.104]  We've already seen the degenerate, corrupt judges of the Supreme Court.
[00:27:30.144 --> 00:27:32.827]  Now it's Kerry that openly funds Al Qaeda.
[00:27:33.348 --> 00:27:37.593]  Worldwide, murdering and blowing up churches and killing Christians everywhere.
[00:27:38.053 --> 00:27:39.495]  And lying about Benghazi.
[00:27:40.375 --> 00:27:41.496]  Eric Holder's behind me.
[00:27:41.516 --> 00:27:42.677]  Oh, it's like the Skeksy Parade.
[00:27:42.697 --> 00:27:44.358]  Oh my, it's the Skeksy Parade.
[00:27:45.139 --> 00:27:49.642]  Fast and Furious caught shipping guns to Mexico to blame the Second Amendment.
[00:27:50.495 --> 00:28:03.527]  And he's got the Energy Secretary there shutting down the power plants, and they've got the Secretary of Defense there, Hagel, who got elected 90% of the districts with his own voting machines in Nebraska.
[00:28:03.547 --> 00:28:04.868]  I mean, isn't this nice?
[00:28:04.888 --> 00:28:06.269]  Here, let's bring in some more criminals.
[00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:10.673]  I mean, when you're informed, the general public just says, he has a nice suit on.
[00:28:11.414 --> 00:28:12.014]  I mean, you know.
[00:28:12.215 --> 00:28:15.878]  Oh, I guarantee it's going to be, you know, how is Michelle Obama's haircut?
[00:28:16.298 --> 00:28:17.979]  I think I'll talk about how he's going great.
[00:28:18.079 --> 00:28:20.060]  You know, it's going to be something stupid.
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:22.362]  Holder's going great, trying to take the guns off the street.
[00:28:22.682 --> 00:28:26.665]  We need to literally talk to the media and have them brainwash the public against the Second Amendment.
[00:28:26.885 --> 00:28:27.545]  Because this is it.
[00:28:27.585 --> 00:28:29.907]  I mean, the play-by-play has begun.
[00:28:29.927 --> 00:28:31.227]  You know, it's about to begin.
[00:28:31.247 --> 00:28:32.208]  Let's just on TV.
[00:28:32.248 --> 00:28:34.469]  Let's just get a chair in here for David Knight.
[00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:37.811]  Let's go ahead and get position and let's turn towards the television.
[00:28:38.172 --> 00:28:39.312]  Mystery, science, tyranny.
[00:28:40.053 --> 00:28:40.453]  Here we go.
[00:28:40.473 --> 00:28:41.614]  This is live, uncensored.
[00:28:42.074 --> 00:28:43.875]  You know, we're not having to
[00:28:45.754 --> 00:28:46.415]  I am not getting a feed here.
[00:28:46.435 --> 00:28:47.116]  I can sure see the criminals.
[00:29:08.894 --> 00:29:09.214]  Yes.
[00:29:10.075 --> 00:29:10.515]  Look at them.
[00:29:10.535 --> 00:29:17.059]  Yeah, I'm wondering if they have the Illuminati like they do at the Super Bowl and the Grammys.
[00:29:17.119 --> 00:29:18.339]  It's pretty much like that now.
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:19.200]  Am I plugged?
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:19.840]  I'm plugged again.
[00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:21.261]  I'm not getting feeds here.
[00:29:21.761 --> 00:29:22.622]  Doesn't matter, it's live.
[00:29:22.682 --> 00:29:25.684]  Hey, I don't even need to hear what they're saying to tell the lies they're telling.
[00:29:26.104 --> 00:29:28.986]  And Michelle's telling that guy that War Hero.
[00:29:29.086 --> 00:29:29.986]  I'm not moving anything here.
[00:29:31.287 --> 00:29:32.728]  Oh, yeah, it's cutting out again.
[00:29:34.769 --> 00:29:36.550]  You know, they show War Heroes like that and yet
[00:29:37.062 --> 00:29:39.183]  You were just talking yesterday to someone from the U.S.S.
[00:29:39.243 --> 00:29:42.924]  Reagan who they won't, still won't acknowledge what they did to these people on the U.S.S.
[00:29:42.964 --> 00:29:45.865]  Reagan when they sent them to Fukushima and exposed them with all that radiation.
[00:29:46.405 --> 00:29:48.125]  Wouldn't even give them iodine as a protection.
[00:29:48.405 --> 00:29:58.969]  Yeah, that's exactly right, David, and not just that, but we see when the veterans come home, you know, they just try to say that they're mentally unfit, try to take their guns, they lock them up, deny them the health care that they fought and deserved for.
[00:29:58.989 --> 00:30:00.829]  You know, they lock up guys like C.J.
[00:30:00.889 --> 00:30:05.471]  Grisham, a guy who went out and fought for his country, and now he can't even walk down the street with his gun, with his own son.
[00:30:07.091 --> 00:30:08.992]  Criticizing the federal government is hateful.
[00:30:09.372 --> 00:30:09.712]  Come on.
[00:30:10.112 --> 00:30:15.455]  I mean, I know I'm extremist, Alex, but I want people to have rights if they, God forbid, went out there and fought for them.
[00:30:15.495 --> 00:30:22.238]  You're a bad guy for being informed and working 15 hours a day, one of the hardest working guys here at the office.
[00:30:22.258 --> 00:30:24.859]  How dare you criticize our
[00:30:25.179 --> 00:30:28.803]  Well, you know, I'm working hard, Alex, but I'm not working hard to take away people's rights.
[00:30:28.823 --> 00:30:43.978]  So I guess, you know, if I just redirected my energy to something positive, you know, like I was, if I was Michelle Obama and I wanted to tell school kids what they could and couldn't eat, or Miss Sebelius, who says, you know, whatever, you know, you ask her a question about what's really going on, whatever, I don't care, it's so-and-so.
[00:30:44.478 --> 00:30:47.819]  More of you say this piece of legislation did this or that.
[00:30:48.399 --> 00:30:50.380]  They just say conspiracy theory.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.500]  You bought two million bullets.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:52.981]  You're launching domestic drones.
[00:30:53.021 --> 00:30:53.561]  Conspiracy.
[00:30:53.601 --> 00:30:54.041]  Conspiracy.
[00:30:54.381 --> 00:30:55.041]  While they admit it.
[00:30:55.181 --> 00:31:03.064]  Leanne McAdoo, as we sit here doing the state of the BS report, what do you make of this?
[00:31:04.284 --> 00:31:07.625]  I just think, I mean, everyone's gathered around for this theater.
[00:31:07.705 --> 00:31:12.726]  Where are all these people when Obama's magic pen is signing executive orders?
[00:31:13.627 --> 00:31:14.907]  Why do they all look so happy?
[00:31:14.987 --> 00:31:15.867]  I mean, they're here.
[00:31:15.887 --> 00:31:18.428]  Because they're con artists, narcissistic crooks.
[00:31:18.688 --> 00:31:29.251]  Listen, Leanne, Boehner, Boehner came out today and he said, well, the president, if he wants to do executive orders and take over, he just better follow the Constitution.
[00:31:29.791 --> 00:31:32.532]  The president ignoring the legislative and judicial
[00:31:33.783 --> 00:31:38.432]  With a pen is a violation of the Constitution completely.
[00:31:40.114 --> 00:31:41.274]  What's happening here?
[00:31:41.314 --> 00:31:42.935]  They tell everybody it's going to start at 8 o'clock.
[00:31:43.435 --> 00:31:48.617]  And now they've got these people from the cabinet taking their walk down the aisle.
[00:31:48.777 --> 00:31:49.358]  These mummies.
[00:31:49.558 --> 00:31:49.938]  These mummies.
[00:31:50.018 --> 00:31:54.079]  It's all screen time for these frickin' peacocks.
[00:31:54.379 --> 00:31:55.380]  Well, I got news for them.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.840]  Their mainstream media is dying.
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:58.101]  They're like the dinosaurs.
[00:31:58.181 --> 00:32:01.982]  Look at that sack of crap out there on the House and Senate floor.
[00:32:02.382 --> 00:32:07.865]  Only a few dozen patriots amongst a literal retreat of globalist droppings.
[00:32:07.925 --> 00:32:08.305]  I'm sorry.
[00:32:08.365 --> 00:32:08.685]  Go ahead.
[00:32:09.861 --> 00:32:12.883]  We're six minutes after and they're still taking their red carpet walks.
[00:32:13.343 --> 00:32:16.585]  And we have to wait for the eight minute clapping narcissists.
[00:32:16.725 --> 00:32:24.510]  Again, folks, this is the latrine cam right now here on the Discovery Channel where we show you inside the New York or DC sewers.
[00:32:25.011 --> 00:32:31.215]  You can see different pieces of scrofula that have been dropped from the hind end of the parasites.
[00:32:31.695 --> 00:32:33.576]  These men aren't even maggots and women.
[00:32:33.956 --> 00:32:36.938]  These are literally the droppings of the globalist George.
[00:32:37.138 --> 00:32:38.199]  I was thinking about George Soros.
[00:32:38.579 --> 00:32:43.383]  He was a guy selling Jews out, his own people, in Nazi Germany.
[00:32:44.223 --> 00:32:44.704]  Absolutely.
[00:32:44.744 --> 00:32:50.988]  There's a real feed with them without their cloaks on that actually disguises their real identity.
[00:32:51.048 --> 00:32:51.789]  Skeksi Parade.
[00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:58.854]  I was thinking about George Soros who admits he was a top Nazi collaborator, but then if you criticize him the ADL comes after him.
[00:32:59.134 --> 00:33:03.558]  When both my grandfathers almost died, one as a fighter pilot and one as a
[00:33:04.638 --> 00:33:16.568]  Liberator and a B-17 pilot over Europe, fighting Nazis, and then I've got to listen to George Soros funding the Democratic Party, who's a Nazi pig, lecture me how I'm a Nazi if I'm against Obama.
[00:33:16.808 --> 00:33:19.651]  What do you say about that, Leanne, Jakari, and then David Knight?
[00:33:20.592 --> 00:33:27.079]  Well, I mean, you look at this shot right here, Alex, and you see all these guys with the top brass on, but, you know, these are the guys who get the benefits.
[00:33:27.099 --> 00:33:39.733]  That guy right there, I mean, I'm sure his benefits are well-deserved, but these are the guys that they'll parade out and say, you know, we helped this guy, this is a good guy, but all the other veterans, the guys who, you know, can skin a buck and run a trot line, they don't care about those guys.
[00:33:39.753 --> 00:33:41.214]  Those are actually the guys they want to target.
[00:33:41.815 --> 00:33:43.055]  That's what they say, and exactly.
[00:33:43.076 --> 00:33:48.137]  They put one poor, disabled hero up next to Michelle, and then it makes her good.
[00:33:48.778 --> 00:33:51.279]  And I have to admit, I didn't like Dempsey, but he did stop.
[00:33:51.599 --> 00:33:55.480]  He did tell Obama there'd be a revolt if he attacked Syria for Al-Qaeda.
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.841]  For that traitor Hagel right there on screen.
[00:33:58.421 --> 00:34:00.342]  To the average American who doesn't know, that's Chuck Hagel.
[00:34:00.742 --> 00:34:02.002]  An absolute demon on screen.
[00:34:02.323 --> 00:34:04.443]  Was part of illegal CIA activities in Vietnam.
[00:34:05.664 --> 00:34:07.024]  Let's put it on screen right there for folks.
[00:34:07.404 --> 00:34:08.565]  Full screen for folks if we can.
[00:34:09.053 --> 00:34:17.639]  Well, obviously they're going to talk about the war some because they've got a veteran that they're going to use as window dressing for their wars, but I think it's really going to focus on the economy because this is an election year.
[00:34:18.339 --> 00:34:20.921]  So I think he's going to tell people how fiscally responsible he is.
[00:34:21.361 --> 00:34:26.905]  It was real interesting when I went back and looked at these... Oh, no, no, he's going to say, make me a dictator, I'll get you jobs.
[00:34:27.205 --> 00:34:28.786]  Make me a dictator, I'll give you free health care.
[00:34:29.166 --> 00:34:31.968]  Well, now he got the health care, now make him a dictator, he'll make it free.
[00:34:32.008 --> 00:34:32.468]  Go ahead, David.
[00:34:32.689 --> 00:34:33.849]  Well, before the 2012 election, in 2011, he was saying,
[00:34:36.511 --> 00:34:39.913]  I'm proposing starting this year we freeze annual domestic spending, okay?
[00:34:39.933 --> 00:34:41.814]  And he said the freeze is going to be painful cuts.
[00:34:42.155 --> 00:34:51.140]  Then after the election, he said these sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts would devastate priorities like election, and this thing known as the sequester is a really bad idea.
[00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.262]  Everyone understands we just can't cut our way to prosperity.
[00:34:54.302 --> 00:34:57.904]  I guess we can spend and borrow our way to prosperity, right?
[00:34:57.984 --> 00:35:00.446]  Absolutely, and I was just thinking, when you get the document
[00:35:00.486 --> 00:35:00.686]  Oh, Vayner!
[00:35:00.706 --> 00:35:01.527]  Vayner is about to speak.
[00:35:13.494 --> 00:35:15.255]  The President of the United States!
[00:35:15.775 --> 00:35:17.075]  Oh my gosh!
[00:35:17.575 --> 00:35:19.436]  They built it up for ten minutes exactly!
[00:35:19.716 --> 00:35:21.457]  Oh my gosh, he's a Hollywood star!
[00:35:21.917 --> 00:35:23.918]  That's exactly what it is.
[00:35:24.058 --> 00:35:27.819]  Meanwhile, Boehner's under amazing heat that he's let Obama be a dictator.
[00:35:28.199 --> 00:35:32.281]  So now he's like, well you better be a good dictator and follow the Constitution.
[00:35:32.621 --> 00:35:33.981]  A constitutional dictator.
[00:35:34.281 --> 00:35:35.702]  In fact, that's the theme here tonight.
[00:35:36.022 --> 00:35:37.662]  We need a constitutional dictator.
[00:35:37.702 --> 00:35:38.583]  Leigh Ann, what do you say to that?
[00:35:38.603 --> 00:35:40.323]  I mean, the fuhrer is coming in.
[00:35:40.603 --> 00:35:42.104]  Are you getting excited, Leigh Ann?
[00:35:42.464 --> 00:35:43.905]  I am so excited.
[00:35:44.305 --> 00:35:47.226]  Actually, let me just... What about an Obama sex tape?
[00:35:47.607 --> 00:35:48.747]  Bigger than Kim Kardashian.
[00:35:48.787 --> 00:35:50.608]  We need one of those.
[00:35:50.988 --> 00:35:51.789]  One of his boyfriends.
[00:35:53.169 --> 00:35:54.050]  There he is, Alex.
[00:35:54.130 --> 00:36:00.033]  It's like when they walk in at a Justin Bieber concert and everybody wants to jump up and shake his hand.
[00:36:02.097 --> 00:36:04.078]  Where are the fainting ladies?
[00:36:04.358 --> 00:36:10.360]  You know, I want to shake the hand of authors I admire, of poets, of trailblazers, of firefighters that go in burning buildings.
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.441]  I want to shake the hand of really cool people that are honorable.
[00:36:13.801 --> 00:36:16.982]  Who cares about Justin Bieber or Barack Obama?
[00:36:17.042 --> 00:36:18.502]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:36:18.842 --> 00:36:20.863]  Aren't we sick of manufactured stars?
[00:36:21.403 --> 00:36:22.804]  Don't we want real people?
[00:36:23.184 --> 00:36:24.724]  Because humans are meant to like stars.
[00:36:24.984 --> 00:36:27.085]  We're meant to admire good men and women.
[00:36:28.052 --> 00:36:29.613]  Of every race, color, creed, and religion.
[00:36:29.653 --> 00:36:30.794]  I admire Martin Luther King.
[00:36:31.074 --> 00:36:32.915]  He believed in so much of what he did, he got killed for it.
[00:36:33.235 --> 00:36:33.996]  Or JFK.
[00:36:34.156 --> 00:36:35.877]  They weren't perfect men, but they were real!
[00:36:36.217 --> 00:36:38.878]  They were so real, the power structure blew their heads off!
[00:36:39.299 --> 00:36:47.644]  But instead, I sit here and look at this pimp up here, using the names of good people to sell an anti-human agenda to break the back of this country.
[00:36:47.684 --> 00:36:48.124]  David Knight.
[00:36:48.956 --> 00:36:50.077]  Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
[00:36:50.097 --> 00:36:52.238]  I guess you could just say he's the man who would be king.
[00:36:52.278 --> 00:36:54.759]  But, you know, he crossed the Rubicon a long time ago.
[00:36:55.219 --> 00:36:59.861]  It's just getting more and more in your face, more and more blatant as every day goes by.
[00:37:00.582 --> 00:37:05.964]  And the fact that he's going to say that he's going to now assert his unilateral agenda, we'll have to see what he's going to do.
[00:37:06.044 --> 00:37:08.686]  But, you know, he's been asserting it all this time.
[00:37:09.146 --> 00:37:11.027]  But now he's just coming out and saying that he's going to do it.
[00:37:11.047 --> 00:37:12.508]  And look, he's meeting with all his mafia.
[00:37:12.948 --> 00:37:14.769]  And Jakari said something so poignant.
[00:37:15.569 --> 00:37:28.579]  In the first part of the interview live tonight, about 40 minutes ago, after the news, he said, I expected Obama to go down after the NDAA, secret arrest, torture of Americans, but instead he just kept going up because he was artificially backed.
[00:37:28.939 --> 00:37:30.620]  That showed me he's going all the way.
[00:37:31.161 --> 00:37:32.482]  And that crystallized it all.
[00:37:32.962 --> 00:37:35.224]  He's going all the way.
[00:37:35.444 --> 00:37:36.445]  Because he's getting away with it.
[00:37:36.665 --> 00:37:41.127]  Because he's getting away with it, and the power structure is scared they've committed so many crimes.
[00:37:41.507 --> 00:37:42.768]  They're going all the way.
[00:37:42.808 --> 00:37:44.329]  Their front man's going all the way.
[00:37:44.709 --> 00:37:45.309]  They're committed.
[00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:46.350]  What do we do about that, David?
[00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:55.674]  Well, when you compare it to Nixon, when you look at what happened with Nixon, the IRS commissioner, at the time he got the enemies list from Nixon, what he did was he put it in the safe, according to him, but he didn't audit anybody.
[00:37:55.694 --> 00:37:59.476]  They could see that he didn't move against the enemies list, and then he gave it to the prosecutors.
[00:37:59.876 --> 00:38:02.618]  They actually impeached Nixon for doing what
[00:38:03.158 --> 00:38:32.278]  Obama is doing on a much much larger scale to everybody but instead now what you see is you see the IRS commissioner actually prosecuting his enemies list lying about it saying that this is something that was done at a lower level something that even though it came out they're now expanding the attack yes exactly arresting filmmakers exactly because nothing happened to him now they're going after the filmmakers now they're going after the political opponents they're expanding it because they got away with it like Hitler exactly exactly I mean we are screwed
[00:38:32.598 --> 00:38:37.362]  Yeah, we're screwed, and now he's finally making his way up to the podium.
[00:38:37.422 --> 00:38:39.023]  You know, gotta shake Biden's hand.
[00:38:39.043 --> 00:38:40.084]  I've never seen that guy before.
[00:38:40.104 --> 00:38:42.325]  And, you know, he's making his rounds.
[00:38:42.345 --> 00:38:43.226]  That won't be too much of a dictator.
[00:38:43.426 --> 00:38:45.428]  Oh, look at those two that play golf every week together.
[00:38:45.888 --> 00:38:49.050]  Acting like... I mean, this is... And look at... Look at Boehner.
[00:38:49.251 --> 00:38:50.752]  I mean, Boehner is a total scum.
[00:38:51.252 --> 00:38:51.913]  Boehner's the enemy.
[00:38:51.953 --> 00:38:53.694]  Leigh Ann, final comments before the Führer speaks.
[00:38:53.834 --> 00:38:57.577]  Well, just all these people are clapping what's about to happen.
[00:38:57.637 --> 00:39:00.219]  I mean, they're like, yay, there's no longer a democracy.
[00:39:00.299 --> 00:39:00.880]  There he is.
[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:02.141]  I'm allegiant to you.
[00:39:02.161 --> 00:39:04.363]  Well, see, they get more power through his power.
[00:39:05.043 --> 00:39:06.445]  This is literally a criminal meeting.
[00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:09.792]  They want the power for when they get it back in office.
[00:39:09.832 --> 00:39:12.853]  They don't want to take it away from Obama because they're going to get back in office someday.
[00:39:12.873 --> 00:39:16.696]  They want to be able to do the indefinite detention without trial or accusation.
[00:39:16.716 --> 00:39:17.056]  Here we go.
[00:39:17.096 --> 00:39:17.436]  That's right.
[00:39:17.456 --> 00:39:17.916]  Here we go.
[00:39:17.997 --> 00:39:18.417]  Here we go.
[00:39:18.457 --> 00:39:21.619]  Now, we will be commenting during his BS sermons.
[00:39:22.539 --> 00:39:22.960]  Here we go.
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:23.540]  Oh, you ready?
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:24.100]  You ready?
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:24.761]  I'm a real guy.
[00:39:24.861 --> 00:39:27.062]  I've been rehearsing this many times.
[00:39:27.362 --> 00:39:27.742]  Here we go.
[00:39:29.143 --> 00:39:30.644]  It's a fake voice, like a preacher voice.
[00:39:30.664 --> 00:39:31.545]  Members of Congress,
[00:39:32.418 --> 00:39:32.998]  Who's that actor?
[00:39:33.038 --> 00:39:35.260]  He admits he copies him?
[00:39:35.661 --> 00:39:37.082]  The President of the United States.
[00:39:37.102 --> 00:39:38.042]  Yeah, Lennox admits.
[00:39:38.563 --> 00:39:40.024]  They're standing back up.
[00:39:40.064 --> 00:39:40.484]  What's that?
[00:39:41.005 --> 00:39:43.927]  Well, you've done such a great job screwing everybody, buddy.
[00:39:44.307 --> 00:39:45.128]  Getting the heat off us.
[00:39:45.388 --> 00:39:46.669]  Hey, let's all clap for him, too.
[00:39:46.689 --> 00:39:47.049]  Come on.
[00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:48.070]  Yeah!
[00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:49.011]  Yeah!
[00:39:49.511 --> 00:39:51.613]  Yeah for Jeffrey Dahmer and Adolf Hitler.
[00:39:52.013 --> 00:39:53.894]  Man, you really are screwing the working people.
[00:39:54.155 --> 00:39:55.336]  Bankrupt in America.
[00:39:56.156 --> 00:39:57.978]  You're dealing with no foreign enemy can do.
[00:39:58.318 --> 00:39:59.098]  Yeah!
[00:39:59.819 --> 00:40:00.660]  Yeah, come on.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:01.180]  Let's clap.
[00:40:06.306 --> 00:40:09.750]  I think that's a good deal Larry.
[00:40:10.451 --> 00:40:16.318]  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, fellow criminals.
[00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:19.023]  Let's get this party started.
[00:40:19.043 --> 00:40:21.165]  We're going to gut this hog and move to Switzerland.
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:35.982]  Total cooked BS.
[00:40:36.062 --> 00:40:36.603]  Lowest IQ.
[00:40:36.623 --> 00:40:37.043]  An entrepreneur.
[00:40:37.544 --> 00:40:39.706]  Flipped on the lights in her tech startup.
[00:40:39.926 --> 00:40:40.808]  I thought they didn't build it.
[00:40:40.828 --> 00:40:41.368]  Did her part.
[00:40:41.729 --> 00:40:42.369]  You got a business.
[00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:43.230]  You didn't build that.
[00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:46.234]  More than 8 million new jobs our businesses have created.
[00:40:46.254 --> 00:40:47.075]  Somebody else did that.
[00:40:47.415 --> 00:40:50.980]  Hey Alex, we're about 30 seconds in and I notice you haven't said anything about how nice his suit looks.
[00:40:51.787 --> 00:40:53.928]  Well, no, all that matters to me is the suit.
[00:40:54.188 --> 00:40:55.469]  You notice that the tie is straight.
[00:40:55.509 --> 00:40:56.129]  An auto worker?
[00:40:56.149 --> 00:40:56.209]  Yes.
[00:40:56.689 --> 00:40:56.929]  Yes, it is.
[00:40:56.949 --> 00:41:00.011]  Fine-tuned some of the best most fuel-efficient cars in the world?
[00:41:00.451 --> 00:41:01.011]  We could learn from that.
[00:41:01.051 --> 00:41:01.752]  And did his part.
[00:41:02.272 --> 00:41:02.572]  Me too.
[00:41:02.592 --> 00:41:05.493]  To help America wean itself off foreign oil.
[00:41:05.733 --> 00:41:09.515]  Oh, wean us off foreign oil while you block the Keystone Pipeline?
[00:41:09.715 --> 00:41:10.175]  You damn liar.
[00:41:10.235 --> 00:41:12.937]  Strongest prior stretch of farm exports in our history.
[00:41:12.957 --> 00:41:16.138]  That's why he signed the Rule of Fairness for every child.
[00:41:16.158 --> 00:41:16.918]  We have the Pentagon.
[00:41:16.938 --> 00:41:17.299]  Spot on, everybody.
[00:41:17.319 --> 00:41:20.020]  First prescription to treat asthma that his mother could afford.
[00:41:21.111 --> 00:41:21.251]  Oh!
[00:41:21.271 --> 00:41:23.613]  What about that lady that never got her house?
[00:41:23.653 --> 00:41:24.153]  What about that?
[00:41:24.173 --> 00:41:26.975]  I mean, the point is they're increasing drug prices.
[00:41:27.615 --> 00:41:28.716]  We pay the highest level for drugs.
[00:41:28.736 --> 00:41:33.939]  A man took the bus home from the graveyard shift, bone-tired, but dreaming big dreams for his son.
[00:41:34.319 --> 00:41:35.580]  He wants you to dream big dreams.
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:37.802]  In a tight-knit community... Dreams of his real father.
[00:41:37.822 --> 00:41:38.362]  ...all across the country.
[00:41:38.402 --> 00:41:39.683]  ...his con artistry one more time.
[00:41:39.703 --> 00:41:41.284]  Fathers and mothers... Stay asleep.
[00:41:41.324 --> 00:41:44.426]  ...tuck in their kids, put an arm around their spouse,
[00:41:45.851 --> 00:41:47.131]  Remember fallen comrades.
[00:41:48.131 --> 00:41:51.632]  Give thanks for being our troops fighting for al-Qaeda.
[00:41:51.792 --> 00:41:52.172]  Long years.
[00:41:52.192 --> 00:41:52.812]  Against Syria.
[00:41:53.092 --> 00:41:54.113]  It's finally coming to an end.
[00:41:55.053 --> 00:41:58.394]  Bahaman cars, I suppose, it's our own government staging bombings.
[00:41:58.754 --> 00:42:01.414]  What about the Muslim Brotherhood coming in past the TSA?
[00:42:01.434 --> 00:42:02.694]  He didn't mention anything about that.
[00:42:02.714 --> 00:42:06.035]  That's right, the Muslim Brotherhood is exempt, but Ja'kar, you've got to fly to the Super Bowl to cover it.
[00:42:06.535 --> 00:42:07.155]  You're going, right?
[00:42:07.215 --> 00:42:10.196]  Ja'kar is going to cover it live on Friday and Sunday.
[00:42:11.004 --> 00:42:11.945]  Well, that's alright.
[00:42:12.685 --> 00:42:15.468]  He probably got blown up by a CIA bomb, that poor veteran right there.
[00:42:15.508 --> 00:42:19.731]  Tonight, this chamber speaks with one voice to the people we represent.
[00:42:20.451 --> 00:42:26.817]  Our minions, our slaves, our food, our citizens, our feet, who make the state of our union strong.
[00:42:27.057 --> 00:42:29.058]  Remember, he stood in the mirror practicing this.
[00:42:29.198 --> 00:42:30.339]  He's talking to his teleprompter.
[00:42:30.359 --> 00:42:32.901]  You speak to the heart, you don't need to stand in front of a damn teleprompter.
[00:42:32.921 --> 00:42:33.862]  You're who we represent.
[00:42:36.397 --> 00:42:38.738]  The lowest unemployment rate in over five years.
[00:42:40.879 --> 00:42:41.379]  What?
[00:42:41.419 --> 00:42:42.299]  He's been in seven.
[00:42:42.959 --> 00:42:47.341]  Oh my god, doubling the blackout unemployment rate since the 1990s.
[00:42:47.681 --> 00:42:48.301]  Oh my god.
[00:42:48.401 --> 00:42:52.602]  They lowered it because they took people off of the register because they haven't had a job for so long.
[00:42:52.622 --> 00:42:53.503]  Yeah, yeah, that's what they do.
[00:42:53.523 --> 00:42:54.163]  It's a total scam.
[00:42:54.643 --> 00:42:56.724]  Real unemployment is 36%.
[00:42:56.884 --> 00:42:58.384]  36, 37, yeah.
[00:42:59.645 --> 00:43:02.086]  But Leanne, forget the real economists.
[00:43:02.146 --> 00:43:03.646]  They claim it's 8% or something, right?
[00:43:04.006 --> 00:43:04.286]  Yeah.
[00:43:04.466 --> 00:43:05.267]  No, everything's fine.
[00:43:06.277 --> 00:43:07.518]  Yeah, everything's fine, yeah.
[00:43:07.838 --> 00:43:10.019]  Lowest rates in five years.
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:16.323]  Business leaders around the world have declared that China is no longer the world's number one place to invest.
[00:43:17.123 --> 00:43:17.723]  America is.
[00:43:18.684 --> 00:43:21.545]  Yeah, you lowered the wages so much, we got more slaves than they did.
[00:43:22.966 --> 00:43:24.187]  Invested all your slave labor.
[00:43:24.207 --> 00:43:25.167]  They're suing it up again.
[00:43:25.428 --> 00:43:25.768]  Okay, alright.
[00:43:26.658 --> 00:43:28.399]  We haven't heard that report.
[00:43:28.419 --> 00:43:28.719]  Yeah, I know.
[00:43:28.739 --> 00:43:29.340]  It's not true.
[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:30.300]  Everything's going to China.
[00:43:30.921 --> 00:43:32.402]  I was just countering his BS.
[00:43:32.422 --> 00:43:33.522]  Breaking news.
[00:43:33.542 --> 00:43:34.243]  Save the Union.
[00:43:35.123 --> 00:43:39.506]  Is that why almost all my family that used to be middle class can't get a job or can't pay their bills and they have a job?
[00:43:39.526 --> 00:43:41.007]  That's right.
[00:43:41.027 --> 00:43:48.952]  After five years of grit and determined effort, the United States is better positioned... Grit and determined effort.
[00:43:48.992 --> 00:43:50.172]  Now he's John Wayne.
[00:43:51.733 --> 00:43:53.915]  The question for everyone in this chamber.
[00:43:55.339 --> 00:43:57.561]  Running through every decision we make this year.
[00:43:58.181 --> 00:43:59.462]  Well, he blocks all of it.
[00:43:59.702 --> 00:44:01.223]  And then says they're gridlocking.
[00:44:01.364 --> 00:44:02.745]  Or hinder this progress.
[00:44:03.345 --> 00:44:04.366]  Hinder this progress.
[00:44:04.906 --> 00:44:05.266]  Of the cancer.
[00:44:05.287 --> 00:44:10.931]  For several years now, this town has been consumed by a rancorous argument over the proper size of the federal government.
[00:44:11.531 --> 00:44:14.053]  His argument is, any debate is gridlock.
[00:44:14.373 --> 00:44:16.334]  That's dictatorship.
[00:44:17.154 --> 00:44:19.696]  See, if you just let me run everything, I'll fix it.
[00:44:20.076 --> 00:44:21.176]  It's coming up.
[00:44:21.797 --> 00:44:26.479]  See, the debate is keeping us from carrying out what we have to do.
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:28.380]  I need to be a dictator.
[00:44:28.781 --> 00:44:30.562]  The banks that run him want to be a dictator.
[00:44:30.582 --> 00:44:32.042]  They already took over Europe.
[00:44:32.263 --> 00:44:35.084]  Look at Italy, where they put the Goldman Sachs guy as the president.
[00:44:35.224 --> 00:44:35.644]  Appointed.
[00:44:36.345 --> 00:44:37.325]  Greece, appointed.
[00:44:37.606 --> 00:44:38.606]  Spain, appointed.
[00:44:39.026 --> 00:44:39.887]  Iceland, appointed.
[00:44:41.027 --> 00:44:43.929]  They are appointing dictators, and that's what they tell them.
[00:44:44.129 --> 00:44:47.311]  We'll fix things that they created if you just make us dictators.
[00:44:47.832 --> 00:44:50.233]  I mean, this is a... Look, how do I know what they're going to do?
[00:44:50.273 --> 00:44:51.674]  They do it over and over again, Jakari.
[00:44:52.094 --> 00:44:53.896]  Exactly, exactly, and people keep standing up.
[00:44:53.956 --> 00:44:55.036]  Oh, rebuilding the trust.
[00:44:55.176 --> 00:44:55.997]  Don't you trust him?
[00:44:56.457 --> 00:44:58.058]  Yes, I do, Alex, as a matter of fact.
[00:44:58.098 --> 00:44:59.019]  I'm glad you brought that up.
[00:44:59.499 --> 00:45:01.160]  I trust him to take my rights away.
[00:45:01.661 --> 00:45:06.204]  Congress finally produced a budget... But why are you facing the facts?
[00:45:06.244 --> 00:45:07.204]  I mean, just be delusional.
[00:45:08.834 --> 00:45:19.722]  Well, you know, when he talks about things like education and the education bubble and, you know, all these kids that go to college that come out with, you know, $30,000 grand, $30 grand plus of student loan debt now they can't find a job.
[00:45:20.122 --> 00:45:28.889]  He's declaring economic victory because he's got a bunch of metrics that the government manufactures that have absolutely nothing to do with the reality.
[00:45:28.909 --> 00:45:30.350]  Oh yeah, they say we're not in a depression.
[00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:33.512]  All the real economists say we've been in a depression since Bush.
[00:45:33.873 --> 00:45:35.354]  The stock market is doing really well.
[00:45:35.914 --> 00:45:38.517]  Stock market is doing really well.
[00:45:39.238 --> 00:45:40.739]  He's performing for his masters.
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:43.502]  But everybody else, Main Street is not doing well.
[00:45:43.722 --> 00:45:47.546]  And they come up with these phony employment figures, these phony GDP figures.
[00:45:47.586 --> 00:45:48.107]  They're phony.
[00:45:48.327 --> 00:45:49.689]  They're cooked metrics.
[00:45:50.267 --> 00:45:55.412]  What I believe unites the people of this nation, regardless of race or region or party.
[00:45:56.133 --> 00:46:06.283]  He says regardless of race, when all his operatives create race baiting and say the NRA is run by the Klan, when his party is on record the party of the Klan.
[00:46:06.303 --> 00:46:07.404]  I mean, let's just be honest.
[00:46:07.964 --> 00:46:19.959]  But he thinks people are so dumb, and I guess they are, they don't know they got freaked out by Eisenhower and the Civil Rights Act of 1961, or 1960, so they flipped the script.
[00:46:19.999 --> 00:46:21.741]  Don't ever say the Klan doesn't know what they're doing.
[00:46:22.522 --> 00:46:26.007]  Margaret Sanger said we gotta hire black people so we can abort all these folks.
[00:46:27.188 --> 00:46:30.749]  Oh yeah, you got Bird from West Virginia, you know, he just recently passed away.
[00:46:30.849 --> 00:46:33.149]  If you don't talk about a Grand Dragon, man, you're racist.
[00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:36.350]  Hey, don't talk about his Grand Dragon friend.
[00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:37.190]  What's your problem?
[00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:39.471]  That Grand Dragon isn't racist, you are.
[00:46:39.531 --> 00:46:40.251]  That's right.
[00:46:40.311 --> 00:46:43.272]  George Soros, a top Nazi collaborator, isn't racist.
[00:46:43.732 --> 00:46:44.612]  He isn't anti-Semitic.
[00:46:44.632 --> 00:46:44.712]  I am!
[00:46:53.683 --> 00:46:56.285]  The level, it's a wall of BS is the issue.
[00:46:56.665 --> 00:46:59.147]  It's the opposite of what they're saying.
[00:46:59.447 --> 00:47:01.048]  Leanne, what's your comments on this?
[00:47:01.148 --> 00:47:05.371]  Well, I'm curious to see what he's going to try and fast track now.
[00:47:07.257 --> 00:47:13.543]  We ought to put him literally next to, in a Photoshop deal, next to, in a Grand Dragon outfit.
[00:47:13.944 --> 00:47:15.446]  I think that's the answer.
[00:47:15.486 --> 00:47:16.146]  No, I'm serious.
[00:47:16.306 --> 00:47:19.069]  Because they're always saying we're racist because we want our guns.
[00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:20.951]  That has no connection to reality.
[00:47:21.732 --> 00:47:23.734]  Why don't we just put him in a Grand Dragon outfit?
[00:47:24.395 --> 00:47:30.484]  Practical proposals to speed up growth, strengthen the middle class, and build new ladder... Speed up growth!
[00:47:30.544 --> 00:47:33.389]  They've got Agenda 21, shutting down our power plants.
[00:47:33.909 --> 00:47:35.512]  If you've got a coal plant, we'll bankrupt you.
[00:47:35.532 --> 00:47:36.994]  Half our power comes from that or more.
[00:47:37.875 --> 00:47:39.958]  David Knight, your comment on speeding up growth?
[00:47:40.659 --> 00:47:49.045]  He's trying to walk this tightrope of saying that our economy is doing great, but we've got to do more for people who are working too many hours, too long, you know.
[00:47:49.125 --> 00:47:56.170]  So he's trying to, he's trying to... You know, Obamacare cuts your hours, Obamacare cuts your hours, and now you've got to work two or three jobs just to make minimum wage now.
[00:47:56.570 --> 00:47:57.410]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:59.132]  He speaks to the problems they create.
[00:47:59.472 --> 00:48:05.636]  He mentioned the Trans-Pacific Partnership last year as something that's going to create jobs, portrayed it exactly the opposite of what it is.
[00:48:05.656 --> 00:48:09.879]  It'll be interesting to see if he talks about that tonight, since he failed to get it done this last year.
[00:48:10.578 --> 00:48:11.178]  Michelle's.
[00:48:12.439 --> 00:48:16.362]  As usual, let's make this personal about my wife that has nothing to do with it.
[00:48:16.822 --> 00:48:19.044]  Let's distract off to her the second puppet.
[00:48:21.926 --> 00:48:26.609]  That's the guy that had his brain blown out.
[00:48:26.969 --> 00:48:31.092]  That guy's got his arm blown off in some fake war, so he's having a clap on his chest.
[00:48:31.112 --> 00:48:31.973]  Poor fella.
[00:48:31.993 --> 00:48:38.938]  There's schools telling your kids what they can and can't eat, but they can eat rat crap in the city of Chicago.
[00:48:39.366 --> 00:48:40.329]  And that's an achievement.
[00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:43.138]  And MSNBC announces our kids will go on to the stage.
[00:48:43.218 --> 00:48:44.181]  That's exactly right.
[00:48:45.919 --> 00:48:50.700]  The Joining Forces Alliance that Michelle and Jill Biden launched has already encouraged employers to hire more people.
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:54.821]  This is all about taking our goodwill as good people.
[00:48:55.061 --> 00:48:58.261]  And so we think, oh, this sounds good and getting us to buy into it.
[00:48:58.301 --> 00:49:02.822]  But, Jakari, like you said, everybody you know, everybody I know that supported Obama is waking up.
[00:49:03.302 --> 00:49:07.303]  We just don't want them to then run to the mainline Republicans and think that's the answer.
[00:49:07.323 --> 00:49:08.643]  Then the seesaw keeps winning.
[00:49:09.124 --> 00:49:11.364]  We want to get constitutionalists
[00:49:12.093 --> 00:49:15.156]  Bill of Rights Constitution has never been fully realized.
[00:49:15.457 --> 00:49:20.121]  Back in, not because that's perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than conscious lying.
[00:49:20.402 --> 00:49:21.923]  We need honorable people.
[00:49:22.244 --> 00:49:28.270]  Imagine if a David Knight, Leanne McAdoo, Jakari Jackson, Alex Jones were in Congress.
[00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:29.551]  I will, and I'm not running.
[00:49:29.972 --> 00:49:33.555]  My point is, I would never compromise or sell people out.
[00:49:34.236 --> 00:49:36.700]  By God, all that matters to me is really being real.
[00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:39.063]  That's the real value in life.
[00:49:39.183 --> 00:49:39.824]  That's right.
[00:49:39.864 --> 00:49:41.346]  We might be standing up saying, you lie.
[00:49:43.163 --> 00:49:44.584]  They believe.
[00:49:45.044 --> 00:49:46.345]  Talk about that congressman, David.
[00:49:46.725 --> 00:49:48.686]  I mean, he got demonized by the Republicans.
[00:49:48.746 --> 00:49:49.607]  Republicans came after him.
[00:49:49.627 --> 00:49:50.567]  But it turned out he was right.
[00:49:50.707 --> 00:49:51.808]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:49:51.888 --> 00:49:52.248]  Absolutely.
[00:49:52.288 --> 00:49:54.250]  We know now that he really lied.
[00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:55.650]  Say his name.
[00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:56.171]  Joe Wilson.
[00:49:56.511 --> 00:49:57.331]  He said, you lie.
[00:49:57.712 --> 00:49:58.432]  Oh yeah.
[00:49:58.772 --> 00:50:00.513]  And we know now that he is, he was lying.
[00:50:00.753 --> 00:50:01.594]  That's four years ago.
[00:50:01.994 --> 00:50:09.959]  And we know that his saying that they weren't going to force people to pay for abortions and their medical coverage if it was against their religion, we know that's a lie.
[00:50:10.947 --> 00:50:11.687]  He said that right after it.
[00:50:11.727 --> 00:50:13.108]  He said, I'm not coming after any of your guys.
[00:50:13.148 --> 00:50:14.629]  Not your rifle, your handgun, your shotgun.
[00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:15.890]  You can keep your doctor.
[00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:18.332]  It's going to cut your bill down to the price of a cable bill.
[00:50:19.412 --> 00:50:21.153]  You know, we're going to shut down Guantanamo.
[00:50:21.333 --> 00:50:22.594]  We're not going to hire any lobbyists.
[00:50:22.774 --> 00:50:26.176]  And that was his big initiative last year in the State of the Union was gun control.
[00:50:26.196 --> 00:50:26.477]  Remember?
[00:50:27.157 --> 00:50:34.522]  That was his big... He had all these anecdotes about people who were suffering from guns and that's how he ended the speech for the big finale.
[00:50:34.962 --> 00:50:36.563]  But we shut that down this last year.
[00:50:37.303 --> 00:50:38.965]  While the government harbors the teeth.
[00:50:38.985 --> 00:50:39.986]  Chakar, your take on that?
[00:50:40.026 --> 00:50:42.387]  Well, we know we're just a bunch of bitter clingers, Alex.
[00:50:42.407 --> 00:50:43.568]  You know that better than anybody.
[00:50:43.628 --> 00:50:47.571]  I know you have guns and Bibles, multiples of both, on the same way.
[00:50:47.612 --> 00:50:53.656]  But, you know, if they want to have the bullets, if they want to have the monopoly of force, if they want to have mind-resisting cars, it's all good.
[00:50:54.617 --> 00:50:56.098]  Drones, too.
[00:50:56.138 --> 00:50:58.540]  Because you can't fight a drone, according to Al Sharpton.
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:03.104]  The defining project of our generation must be to restore that promise.
[00:51:04.312 --> 00:51:05.212]  While they take it away.
[00:51:05.232 --> 00:51:07.874]  They just want to get us to work harder for their BS.
[00:51:08.074 --> 00:51:11.416]  The best measure of opportunity is access to a good job.
[00:51:12.996 --> 00:51:17.239]  With the economy picking up speed, companies say they intend to hire more people this year.
[00:51:17.459 --> 00:51:20.340]  That's because they can't have full-time employees.
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:21.261]  Exactly.
[00:51:21.301 --> 00:51:23.022]  You gotta hire more people.
[00:51:23.042 --> 00:51:24.362]  30 hours under Obamacare.
[00:51:24.382 --> 00:51:25.423]  Go ahead and speak for that, Chakari.
[00:51:25.843 --> 00:51:31.446]  No, no, that's just what David was saying because you can't have a full-time employee because they don't want to pay those Obamacare benefits.
[00:51:31.846 --> 00:51:34.869]  Listen, we can't hire more people because of Obamacare.
[00:51:35.069 --> 00:51:40.653]  I mean, I bust my butt bringing money in here, and let me tell you, it takes a lot to run all this.
[00:51:40.793 --> 00:51:43.756]  And they make me, I pay people above what media standard is.
[00:51:44.136 --> 00:51:50.141]  But the way healthcare works, if I've got to do all that, and then I've got to do all these regulations, I just can't do it.
[00:51:50.181 --> 00:51:51.342]  He said he's going to lower tax rates?
[00:51:51.382 --> 00:51:52.603]  Did he actually just say that?
[00:51:58.908 --> 00:52:01.610]  At least he's backed off his speeches where he says, you didn't build that.
[00:52:03.771 --> 00:52:04.992]  But see, now he's a dictator.
[00:52:05.012 --> 00:52:05.372]  It doesn't matter.
[00:52:05.392 --> 00:52:06.533]  He can tell you whatever you want to hear.
[00:52:08.134 --> 00:52:09.315]  It's like whispering in a girl's ear.
[00:52:10.096 --> 00:52:20.143]  Moreover, we can take the money we save from this transition to tax reform to create jobs, rebuilding our roads, upgrading our ports, unclogging our commutes.
[00:52:21.141 --> 00:52:25.365]  Because in today's global economy, first class jobs... They're going to measure every mile you drive.
[00:52:25.385 --> 00:52:26.886]  What kind of commission are we going to have?
[00:52:26.967 --> 00:52:28.708]  They're going to tax us on every single mile.
[00:52:28.728 --> 00:52:34.153]  Congress to protect more than 3 million jobs by finishing transportation and waterways bills this summer.
[00:52:36.355 --> 00:52:37.777]  Select jobs for the mafia.
[00:52:40.182 --> 00:52:41.203]  But I'll act on my own.
[00:52:41.583 --> 00:52:42.324]  To slash bureaucracy.
[00:52:42.344 --> 00:52:42.765]  Here we go.
[00:52:42.885 --> 00:52:44.406]  And streamline the permitting process.
[00:52:44.466 --> 00:52:44.987]  Here we go.
[00:52:45.367 --> 00:52:47.369]  Streamline the permitting.
[00:52:47.469 --> 00:52:48.090]  Act on my own.
[00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:51.393]  Remember how he said, Jakari, I'll never act on my own as a constitutional?
[00:52:51.633 --> 00:52:53.435]  And he said, I don't want to act on my own, but you want me to?
[00:52:53.915 --> 00:52:55.417]  For six years he's been selling.
[00:52:55.837 --> 00:52:57.659]  I don't want to act on my own, but it will sure fix things.
[00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:01.342]  No, he's streamlining the permitting process.
[00:53:01.382 --> 00:53:02.662]  Which means he gives it to his buddies.
[00:53:02.742 --> 00:53:04.083]  I said that before he said it.
[00:53:04.624 --> 00:53:05.444]  Bush used to say that.
[00:53:05.464 --> 00:53:08.466]  Remember when he made the comment, it would be a lot easier if I could just be a dictator?
[00:53:08.486 --> 00:53:10.067]  Yeah, a lot easier if I was a dictator.
[00:53:10.347 --> 00:53:12.469]  Just so long as I'm the dictator.
[00:53:13.089 --> 00:53:14.090]  Well, he's going to do it.
[00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:17.392]  But that's racist against white people that you don't like Bush.
[00:53:18.621 --> 00:53:20.102]  I used to hear that when I didn't like Bush.
[00:53:20.222 --> 00:53:24.143]  I would get these emails by white supremacists saying, you just don't like white people.
[00:53:24.923 --> 00:53:26.184]  It's the same mindless crap.
[00:53:26.304 --> 00:53:31.946]  Listen, if Obama had blue skin and was like Rand Paul or Ron Paul, I'd support him.
[00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:35.252]  He could have antennas on the top of his head.
[00:53:35.772 --> 00:53:39.275]  All I want is my freedom, and not foreign corporations running all this.
[00:53:39.575 --> 00:53:40.956]  This is great coverage, isn't it?
[00:53:41.277 --> 00:53:41.637]  Exactly.
[00:53:41.697 --> 00:53:42.578]  It's disrespectful.
[00:53:42.858 --> 00:53:46.741]  I'm glad that some people are now tired of standing up and clapping, like, look at this guy with his paper in his hand.
[00:53:46.761 --> 00:53:48.062]  He's like, yeah, I don't care about this.
[00:53:48.082 --> 00:53:49.123]  He's like, wait a minute.
[00:53:52.867 --> 00:53:57.990]  Over the past five years, my administration has made more loans to small businesses than any other.
[00:53:58.390 --> 00:53:58.931]  You know why?
[00:53:58.951 --> 00:54:00.792]  Because we had the Small Business Bureau head on.
[00:54:00.992 --> 00:54:04.634]  They call billionaire corporations small business now, including offshore.
[00:54:04.854 --> 00:54:09.857]  Like you said, they change all the definitions, they change all the metrics, they game them with computers.
[00:54:10.497 --> 00:54:16.100]  By law, they're supposed to have certain set-asides for small businesses, and yet they're giving them to the largest corporations.
[00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:17.581]  They're getting the biggest contracts.
[00:54:17.701 --> 00:54:21.844]  And then he says, I've given record amounts to small businesses because they game the computer.
[00:54:23.325 --> 00:54:24.907]  That's not how you define small business.
[00:54:25.648 --> 00:54:26.669]  Hey, David.
[00:54:27.329 --> 00:54:28.791]  Obamacare cut the health care cost.
[00:54:28.871 --> 00:54:29.712]  Doesn't matter, it doubled it.
[00:54:29.792 --> 00:54:30.713]  That's right, that's right.
[00:54:31.074 --> 00:54:32.175]  My dad's is doubled.
[00:54:32.215 --> 00:54:33.156]  People I know's tripled.
[00:54:33.576 --> 00:54:34.197]  Mine's doubled.
[00:54:34.477 --> 00:54:35.398]  That's no big deal.
[00:54:35.719 --> 00:54:38.001]  I've never even had a claim, David.
[00:54:38.061 --> 00:54:39.943]  Except when my wife had kids.
[00:54:40.324 --> 00:54:40.824]  Neither should we.
[00:54:43.223 --> 00:54:48.046]  We know that the nation that goes all in on innovation today will own the global economy.
[00:54:48.066 --> 00:54:50.227]  That we innovate and you give to China and everybody else.
[00:54:50.247 --> 00:54:52.208]  This is an edge America cannot surrender.
[00:54:52.228 --> 00:54:54.229]  The NSA takes our technology and gives it to Silicon Valley.
[00:54:54.249 --> 00:54:59.452]  Federally funded research helped lead to the ideas and inventions behind Google and smartphones.
[00:54:59.832 --> 00:55:01.533]  That's how you control it, the NSA.
[00:55:01.553 --> 00:55:02.533]  Nice, nice prism, yeah.
[00:55:02.653 --> 00:55:03.494]  You didn't build that.
[00:55:03.534 --> 00:55:05.095]  Last year's cuts to basic research.
[00:55:06.015 --> 00:55:13.421]  Eisenhower warned of the military-industrial complex dominating technology so they could selectively give it to insiders.
[00:55:13.801 --> 00:55:15.462]  Here he is 50 years later.
[00:55:15.482 --> 00:55:20.066]  Do they have a applause sign like they do on Jay Leno because these people keep standing up and clapping?
[00:55:20.106 --> 00:55:21.927]  Is it just like right out of camera shop?
[00:55:23.814 --> 00:55:24.734]  That's a good question.
[00:55:24.774 --> 00:55:25.415]  Not antibiotics.
[00:55:25.475 --> 00:55:29.756]  They're going to stop making antibiotics.
[00:55:29.796 --> 00:55:33.297]  By the way, vaccines aren't for bacteria, they're for viruses.
[00:55:33.317 --> 00:55:34.298]  Did you hear that?
[00:55:34.338 --> 00:55:39.360]  They're for bacteria.
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:44.862]  Yeah, don't let you sue them when their own vaccines kill you dead in a hammer.
[00:55:45.502 --> 00:55:47.002]  Gardasil gives you the damn warts.
[00:55:48.223 --> 00:55:51.264]  Now, one of the biggest factors in bringing more jobs back
[00:55:52.276 --> 00:55:56.698]  You know, everything was paid for, like a Super Bowl ad with donors.
[00:55:56.718 --> 00:55:58.058]  This was all paid for.
[00:55:58.078 --> 00:56:00.619]  Like, that's the angle that's just come out before, but nobody covers it.
[00:56:00.739 --> 00:56:03.400]  Every line has been paid for by special interests.
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:04.820]  Like, do this, do that.
[00:56:05.481 --> 00:56:09.282]  So, he probably got paid $5 million for the Democrats just to say vaccines are good for you.
[00:56:10.638 --> 00:56:12.399]  One of the reasons why is natural gas.
[00:56:12.639 --> 00:56:14.440]  He should have to wear all his sponsors.
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:16.381]  It'd be pretty tacky if he had all those patches.
[00:56:16.761 --> 00:56:20.663]  It'd be defense contractors, foreign banks, big Klu Klux Klan sign on his chest.
[00:56:20.703 --> 00:56:27.467]  This is a plan to invest almost a hundred billion dollars in new factories that use natural gas.
[00:56:28.737 --> 00:56:29.498]  I'll cut red tape.
[00:56:29.558 --> 00:56:31.319]  You gotta hand it to the Ku Klux Klan though.
[00:56:31.819 --> 00:56:36.402]  They fought for 40 years to keep blacks from getting guns and the NRA had to be formed.
[00:56:37.123 --> 00:56:43.707]  And then they took over the Democratic Party and it's the black cities that can't have guns that have the highest crime rates because the criminals run wild.
[00:56:44.548 --> 00:56:45.929]  Then it creates a criminal society.
[00:56:46.329 --> 00:56:47.590]  You've got to actually hand it to them.
[00:56:47.971 --> 00:56:50.152]  They are smarter than us at many levels.
[00:56:50.192 --> 00:56:50.673]  No, they are!
[00:56:51.093 --> 00:56:51.453]  They are!
[00:56:51.673 --> 00:56:52.054]  They are!
[00:56:52.194 --> 00:56:56.577]  And we're so damn naive and so nice, we cannot figure it out.
[00:56:56.877 --> 00:56:59.919]  And I don't mean to bring this Klan thing up over and over again.
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:08.706]  It just started clicking to me this weekend about George Soros being a top Nazi collaborator and the ADL gives him awards and attacks me when I attack him.
[00:57:08.926 --> 00:57:13.249]  When he went on 60 Minutes and admitted he was a Nazi collaborator and said, no big deal, it was a good thing, good.
[00:57:14.289 --> 00:57:19.115]  And then I think about how he's trying to overthrow Kiev and Ukraine because they won't join the EU.
[00:57:19.695 --> 00:57:21.117]  And then I thought about the Democrats.
[00:57:21.157 --> 00:57:27.104]  And I went back and did research about how they literally... The Ku Klux Klan had millions that used to march every year.
[00:57:27.344 --> 00:57:28.646]  They are the Democrats.
[00:57:29.246 --> 00:57:32.410]  And I think about how they literally run everything.
[00:57:35.566 --> 00:57:37.550]  I just can't believe how dumb we've been!
[00:57:37.931 --> 00:57:40.115]  These damn people are criminals!
[00:57:40.175 --> 00:57:41.578]  I mean, it's amazing!
[00:57:42.419 --> 00:57:46.226]  Literally, this is on record, Martin Luther King was a Republican.
[00:57:47.349 --> 00:57:49.270]  And they came to him and they said, you better join the Democrats.
[00:57:49.310 --> 00:57:50.150]  He wouldn't do it, they shot him.
[00:57:50.790 --> 00:57:55.292]  And then they put Jesse Jackson, it turned out, People Have Gone Public was there, knew all about it, helped cover it up.
[00:57:55.952 --> 00:57:59.334]  They literally killed Martin Luther King because he wouldn't join these people.
[00:57:59.514 --> 00:58:02.015]  And I'm not defending the Republicans, they bought them off too.
[00:58:02.335 --> 00:58:07.097]  The point is, these are the worst damn people there are, and I'm sick of their crap!
[00:58:07.437 --> 00:58:09.918]  What do you say to that, David, Jakaria, then Leanne?
[00:58:10.638 --> 00:58:11.458]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[00:58:11.478 --> 00:58:15.660]  Oh, they rescued the automakers by shipping it to China, General Motors.
[00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:17.500]  I mean, it's all BS.
[00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:18.141]  Go ahead, David.
[00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:19.201]  You're absolutely right.
[00:58:19.221 --> 00:58:21.402]  When I was growing up in Florida, it was all Democrats.
[00:58:21.802 --> 00:58:23.783]  And that was when they had the bad segregation thing.
[00:58:23.863 --> 00:58:28.684]  And that was, it was Eisenhower who sent in the people to stop that, the National Guard to stop that.
[00:58:28.924 --> 00:58:30.525]  And then they just pivoted real quick.
[00:58:30.565 --> 00:58:34.186]  And all of a sudden now, they're the good guys, the Democrats, right?
[00:58:34.226 --> 00:58:35.427]  The ones, the same ones.
[00:58:35.447 --> 00:58:37.107]  They fought the Civil Rights Act.
[00:58:37.287 --> 00:58:37.967]  Yeah, it was the same.
[00:58:37.988 --> 00:58:39.208]  But the public's so damn dumb.
[00:58:39.548 --> 00:58:44.430]  They didn't even change Democrat politicians, they just said, okay, now we're the pro-civil rights guys.
[00:58:45.130 --> 00:58:47.371]  Yeah, but I no longer ran Dragon in Congress.
[00:58:47.391 --> 00:58:49.011]  That's right, they just took off the hood.
[00:58:49.291 --> 00:58:50.592]  And they're good guys, you know?
[00:58:51.412 --> 00:58:53.573]  It's so over the top, I can't even believe it, Chikari.
[00:58:53.633 --> 00:58:58.374]  Oh yeah, I mean, everything David just said, it's just, it's smoke and mirrors.
[00:58:58.414 --> 00:59:03.076]  Like I said, we have to change the system as a whole, not just replace a Democrat with a Republican.
[00:59:04.306 --> 00:59:06.609]  I agree, but the Democrats right now are the tip of the spear.
[00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:09.172]  And the Republican leadership is trying to block the Tea Party.
[00:59:09.192 --> 00:59:11.816]  Why do you think they're demonizing the Tea Party so bad, Jakari?
[00:59:12.637 --> 00:59:15.160]  They don't want any real grassroots movement.
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:21.688]  They want all this fake, provocateur-controlled opposition, I guess is the proper term.
[00:59:22.088 --> 00:59:22.629]  That's a good point.
[00:59:24.605 --> 00:59:38.675]  Well, that's kind of like the Nazi playbook, where it was like the 50 steps, and one of the big ones was infiltrating one of the parties in the country, and to convince them that, you know, that's the good party, and that would be how you would take that country down.
[00:59:39.476 --> 00:59:41.818]  And in that case, the Nazis were going to use the Republicans.
[00:59:42.238 --> 00:59:42.819]  But that failed.
[00:59:42.839 --> 00:59:43.179]  Go ahead.
[00:59:43.567 --> 00:59:46.329]  I forget what that thing was, but that was like... No, no, it was the Cormac Dixon Committee.
[00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:46.830]  Yeah, you're right.
[00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:50.873]  It was mind-blowing, because right there you see all the points with taking it down.
[00:59:50.893 --> 00:59:53.655]  And just the Grammys was a perfect example of that.
[00:59:54.235 --> 00:59:55.616]  Of their plan working.
[00:59:55.696 --> 01:00:00.020]  And these are the Democratic people, they had the gay weddings, you know, during the Grammys.
[01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:01.140]  It's like their playbook.
[01:00:01.661 --> 01:00:02.321]  Play by play.
[01:00:02.341 --> 01:00:04.523]  Here we go, immigration.
[01:00:05.183 --> 01:00:08.126]  I mean, we got the most open borders in the world.
[01:00:08.406 --> 01:00:10.007]  We give the illegals all this free stuff.
[01:00:10.307 --> 01:00:12.129]  We're bankrupt if we do this, guys.
[01:00:14.851 --> 01:00:16.153]  It's just mind-boggling to me.
[01:00:16.233 --> 01:00:18.155]  Can I go to Mexico, Jakari, and get a free baby?
[01:00:18.175 --> 01:00:20.738]  I mean, can I go to Mexico without having to be stopped at the border?
[01:00:20.858 --> 01:00:21.719]  I mean, can we start with that?
[01:00:21.859 --> 01:00:25.083]  And I know that members of both parties in the House want to do the same.
[01:00:25.103 --> 01:00:26.685]  Because big money wants it.
[01:00:26.705 --> 01:00:33.372]  Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by only... Only because you aborted 55 million people.
[01:00:34.013 --> 01:00:34.714]  And for good reason.
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:45.229]  When people come here to fulfill their dreams... Bringing these people in is going to put pressure on the people at the lowest end of the wage scale.
[01:00:45.269 --> 01:00:57.279]  So he's saying to these people that he's going to help them with minimum wage, but, you know, the last couple nights I've done the news, I've talked about what's going on in Ukraine, you're talking about what Soros and these other guys are doing, but there's a lot of people in Ukraine who are fighting...
[01:00:58.729 --> 01:01:00.912]  You're talking about a Nazi collaborator, don't be.
[01:01:01.112 --> 01:01:08.301]  That's right, there's a lot of people who are fighting back in the streets because they were the victims of Stalin's genocide.
[01:01:08.341 --> 01:01:15.050]  And one of the things that Stalin did, there were four things that he did, one of those was to bring in a massive immigration of Russians.
[01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:18.452]  Who are going to be on the side of the statists who are trying to control them.
[01:01:18.872 --> 01:01:21.453]  And that's exactly what they're doing with this massive immigration.
[01:01:21.593 --> 01:01:22.014]  Exactly.
[01:01:22.074 --> 01:01:25.816]  And the Ukrainians remember the evil of Stalin 60 years ago.
[01:01:26.376 --> 01:01:27.857]  And I'm not siding with Russia.
[01:01:28.197 --> 01:01:30.738]  The point is the EU is another greater evil.
[01:01:31.219 --> 01:01:33.020]  Russia's not even trying to dominate Ukraine.
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:37.382]  But you know, of course, the Europeans don't even understand what's really going on in the EU for the most part.
[01:01:37.542 --> 01:01:39.823]  So why would we expect that the Ukrainians would understand?
[01:01:39.863 --> 01:01:41.764]  They're going to jump out of the frying pan and into the fire.
[01:01:42.004 --> 01:01:43.545]  They don't know anything about what's going on in the EU.
[01:01:43.565 --> 01:01:44.826]  Because they're experts on sports.
[01:01:45.206 --> 01:01:45.646]  Soccer.
[01:01:46.267 --> 01:01:47.628]  Not experts on politique.
[01:01:47.928 --> 01:01:48.128]  Jakari?
[01:01:48.148 --> 01:01:50.090]  No, you said it well.
[01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:50.710]  You said it well.
[01:02:00.188 --> 01:02:05.191]  Is that why I bought two cars from Detroit the last two years?
[01:02:05.632 --> 01:02:08.674]  You're doing everything you can to shut down Detroit.
[01:02:09.154 --> 01:02:10.195]  Man, I'm sick of this!
[01:02:11.315 --> 01:02:13.957]  $22 billion to ship General Motors to China.
[01:02:14.618 --> 01:02:16.679]  And by the way, that doesn't even help the Chinese.
[01:02:16.759 --> 01:02:17.940]  They pay them slave labor.
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.382]  And Angie, they didn't have to pay back.
[01:02:20.442 --> 01:02:22.383]  And now Fiat owns Chrysler 100%.
[01:02:22.423 --> 01:02:24.565]  Yeah, they're moving Jeep.
[01:02:24.765 --> 01:02:25.746]  Yes.
[01:02:25.826 --> 01:02:27.387]  I bought my dad a Jeep five years ago.
[01:02:27.967 --> 01:02:29.748]  They're moving Jeep to Italy.
[01:02:30.029 --> 01:02:34.032]  Yeah, they gave him a sweetheart deal and just a couple... Now wait a minute, are you against Italians?
[01:02:34.872 --> 01:02:37.134]  Wait a minute, Obama just said... Yeah, I'm gonna change the subject.
[01:02:37.354 --> 01:02:37.694]  The U.S.
[01:02:37.774 --> 01:02:38.455]  is the best country.
[01:02:38.475 --> 01:02:40.736]  It goes along with his Fiat rule that he's got here.
[01:02:40.756 --> 01:02:41.177]  Rule by Fiat.
[01:02:42.998 --> 01:02:48.881]  That's racist to use an Italian word.
[01:02:49.121 --> 01:02:52.363]  To fill government type jobs, the only new economy.
[01:02:52.463 --> 01:02:53.043]  Right.
[01:02:53.103 --> 01:02:55.284]  And to indoctrinate, do what we say, you get a job.
[01:02:55.444 --> 01:03:00.507]  Well, janitors and stuff, he's raising the minimum wage if you're a federal contractor.
[01:03:00.567 --> 01:03:01.968]  Even though he's inflating the currency.
[01:03:02.168 --> 01:03:02.348]  Yeah.
[01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:12.376]  I'm also convinced we can help Americans return to the workforce faster by reforming unemployment insurance so that it's more effective in today's economy.
[01:03:12.816 --> 01:03:17.299]  Yeah, that means I won't hire anybody because they get all this unemployment insurance.
[01:03:17.399 --> 01:03:23.783]  I hire employees that literally sometimes act like Linda Blair or whatever, and then I'm supposed to pay them unemployment insurance.
[01:03:25.965 --> 01:03:26.525]  Not you guys.
[01:03:26.545 --> 01:03:27.666]  You guys have been a real catch.
[01:03:29.031 --> 01:03:29.951]  A creme de la creme.
[01:03:29.971 --> 01:03:31.632]  You and John Bowne and Darren McBrain.
[01:03:32.393 --> 01:03:34.313]  Darren will be here tonight, but he's out with a stomachache.
[01:03:35.214 --> 01:03:35.334]  Oh.
[01:03:35.574 --> 01:03:35.874]  Yeah.
[01:03:36.074 --> 01:03:36.735]  Sorry to hear that.
[01:03:37.575 --> 01:03:38.275]  Let me tell you why.
[01:03:39.216 --> 01:03:39.856]  He does good work.
[01:03:39.876 --> 01:03:42.877]  Misty DeMars, the mother of two young boys.
[01:03:43.178 --> 01:03:43.898]  Oh, here we go.
[01:03:44.238 --> 01:03:45.379]  She'd been steadily employed.
[01:03:45.399 --> 01:03:47.800]  Let me recognize you, a mama of two boys.
[01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:48.960]  They hit every demographic.
[01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:51.621]  Jacari, talk about, were you in here, it was Leanne.
[01:03:52.182 --> 01:03:54.843]  We saw the intro, all these Hollywood stars and him in front of the mirror.
[01:03:55.123 --> 01:03:55.944]  Oh yeah, I saw that.
[01:03:56.305 --> 01:03:59.809]  He did a movie, I guess a movie with Spielberg.
[01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:02.212]  And it was like, unplayed by Daniel Day-Lewis.
[01:04:02.232 --> 01:04:05.356]  And there's him up there talking and then he's hanging out with the Miami Heat.
[01:04:06.097 --> 01:04:07.840]  Just, you know, a big time celebrity.
[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:10.643]  You know, I don't have a problem with a guy having celebrity friends and all that.
[01:04:10.964 --> 01:04:11.585]  But we see Jamie Foxx.
[01:04:11.605 --> 01:04:12.506]  But that's all they've got.
[01:04:12.526 --> 01:04:13.287]  That's all they've got.
[01:04:13.407 --> 01:04:15.868]  This was the feed on WhiteHouse.gov.
[01:04:16.148 --> 01:04:17.489]  This is like a blooping video feed.
[01:04:17.509 --> 01:04:19.189]  Barack Obama, our Lord and Savior?
[01:04:19.209 --> 01:04:25.992]  Right, showing him hobnobbing with Carole King and all these different stars and primping in front of the mirror.
[01:04:26.672 --> 01:04:28.953]  Well, it was on the loop to show the State of the Union.
[01:04:29.013 --> 01:04:30.374]  No, it showed him practicing.
[01:04:30.394 --> 01:04:31.994]  Yeah, James Hill was there.
[01:04:32.315 --> 01:04:37.196]  I will pay my taxes and we will raise our children in their own home in the community we live in.
[01:04:37.216 --> 01:04:38.017]  And give them vaccines.
[01:04:38.057 --> 01:04:40.498]  Wait a minute, MSNBC says the state runs our kids.
[01:04:42.659 --> 01:04:47.223]  Congress, give these hard-working, responsible Americans that chance.
[01:04:47.263 --> 01:04:49.846]  See, Congress, do whatever I say.
[01:04:49.906 --> 01:04:50.947]  Raise the debt limit.
[01:04:51.027 --> 01:04:52.128]  Get rid of all the freedom.
[01:04:52.508 --> 01:04:53.870]  Give me dictatorial power.
[01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:54.671]  You've already done it.
[01:04:55.071 --> 01:04:56.132]  I'm gonna blame you.
[01:04:56.552 --> 01:04:57.553]  Make me the Führer.
[01:04:57.914 --> 01:04:58.534]  Come on.
[01:04:58.714 --> 01:04:59.615]  I'm Adolf Hitler.
[01:05:00.016 --> 01:05:00.937]  I will free Germany.
[01:05:01.217 --> 01:05:02.218]  Just give me the power.
[01:05:02.498 --> 01:05:04.961]  Don't tell me that he's pro-business and pro-family.
[01:05:05.401 --> 01:05:06.522]  They're not pro-choice.
[01:05:06.602 --> 01:05:09.285]  The only choice they want to give you is whether or not you kill your kid.
[01:05:09.345 --> 01:05:14.411]  They don't want to give you a choice about whether you give your kid a vaccine, how you educate your kid, what you feed your kid.
[01:05:14.891 --> 01:05:17.053]  Only if you're going to kill your kid do they give you a choice.
[01:05:17.073 --> 01:05:19.156]  That's right, but David, this whole info war is complex.
[01:05:19.796 --> 01:05:20.457]  I didn't build it.
[01:05:20.497 --> 01:05:21.477]  The listeners didn't build it.
[01:05:21.837 --> 01:05:23.539]  You and Jakari and Leigh-Anne didn't build it.
[01:05:23.819 --> 01:05:28.262]  Marcos Morales out there and Rob Dew and Wes, none of them built it.
[01:05:28.642 --> 01:05:29.803]  Joe, you didn't build it.
[01:05:30.483 --> 01:05:31.204]  He built it!
[01:05:31.464 --> 01:05:32.504]  Get it straight!
[01:05:32.885 --> 01:05:34.846]  Government, you're racist against the state.
[01:05:36.587 --> 01:05:37.428]  Sick!
[01:05:37.508 --> 01:05:39.789]  Jakari, you want to thank Obama for building your career?
[01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:40.970]  I definitely would.
[01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:42.771]  Did he put your socks on this morning?
[01:05:42.951 --> 01:05:46.694]  He did and he brushed my teeth and he shaved my head and did a whole bunch of stuff for me.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:51.023]  Tony, that is a little racist.
[01:05:51.123 --> 01:05:51.843]  I know, I know.
[01:05:51.863 --> 01:05:53.465]  Because you're criticizing Obama right now.
[01:05:53.625 --> 01:05:53.965]  I know.
[01:05:54.866 --> 01:05:56.147]  Leanne, you too, you got a shaved head.
[01:05:56.227 --> 01:05:57.148]  That's racist.
[01:05:57.188 --> 01:05:59.210]  He gave you a closer cut than he gave himself there.
[01:05:59.510 --> 01:06:01.572]  Hey, I'm going to have a naturally shaved head soon.
[01:06:01.773 --> 01:06:05.596]  It's all falling out from the radiation.
[01:06:05.636 --> 01:06:06.497]  We bring it in the youth.
[01:06:06.517 --> 01:06:09.379]  Great teachers and an innovative tutoring program.
[01:06:10.356 --> 01:06:11.076]  He let him march.
[01:06:11.436 --> 01:06:12.717]  Oh look, he's a teacher!
[01:06:13.117 --> 01:06:17.659]  We care about you while we try to get rid of public education and make it corporate education.
[01:06:17.919 --> 01:06:20.540]  They ruin public education, they make it corporate education.
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.341]  And oh, we gotta help you with Bill and Melinda Gates.
[01:06:23.381 --> 01:06:24.442]  He's going to college this fall.
[01:06:24.582 --> 01:06:29.184]  He's training the new robots to be obedient.
[01:06:29.204 --> 01:06:33.326]  He's like, we can't kill this guy yet, but Foxconn robots are coming online soon.
[01:06:35.547 --> 01:06:38.388]  Five years ago, we set out to change the odds for all our kids.
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:51.705]  We worked with lenders to reform student loans, and today more... It's like the housing deal where they screw everybody with a new deal on that.
[01:06:51.785 --> 01:07:01.869]  I mean, I guess I was in school more recently than anybody else, and everybody is just, you know, out the wazoo with student loans.
[01:07:01.889 --> 01:07:08.071]  You know, I was lucky to get out with a little over five grand, but a lot of people have much more than that.
[01:07:08.331 --> 01:07:11.234]  Yeah, don't lower the cost of the tuition or the cost of the school.
[01:07:11.314 --> 01:07:13.436]  Just give them the ability to become debt slaves.
[01:07:13.756 --> 01:07:16.979]  And you can't even get rid of your college debt if you declare bankruptcy.
[01:07:17.039 --> 01:07:18.800]  So you're permanently in debt to these people.
[01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:20.402]  Yeah, well he changed that so he can't get out.
[01:07:20.442 --> 01:07:21.223]  That's a reform.
[01:07:22.185 --> 01:07:23.146]  Change you can believe in.
[01:07:44.437 --> 01:07:48.081]  Well, I just, what's wrong with artificially increasing the price of labor?
[01:07:48.421 --> 01:07:51.905]  Well, in this job market, a lot of college graduates are doing minimum wage jobs.
[01:07:52.025 --> 01:07:52.545]  It's a fact.
[01:07:52.926 --> 01:07:53.086]  Yeah.
[01:07:53.707 --> 01:07:57.490]  I go to H-E-B, a local food store, to get food and stuff for the family.
[01:07:58.111 --> 01:08:01.014]  And I run into people that have, like, three degrees, PhDs.
[01:08:01.835 --> 01:08:06.760]  You're not getting a job unless it's for a defense contractor, or homeland security, or data mining.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.762]  Yeah, they'll try to recruit you, you know, straight in college.
[01:08:09.782 --> 01:08:19.928]  When I was in college, you know, I met with, well, not met, you know, officially, but went to job fairs and talked to by the FBI, many other alphabet agencies.
[01:08:19.948 --> 01:08:20.909]  They all were trying to recruit me.
[01:08:20.969 --> 01:08:22.750]  I was a criminal justice major.
[01:08:22.790 --> 01:08:24.371]  Hey, you want to come, come work with us?
[01:08:24.431 --> 01:08:25.151]  I'm glad I didn't.
[01:08:25.171 --> 01:08:26.612]  They may have tried to, you know, have some drill.
[01:08:26.632 --> 01:08:27.813]  You want to show up to our drill next week?
[01:08:28.233 --> 01:08:33.016]  You know, hold this, hold this bomb and, you know, and be set up for the rest of your life like the, like the Tsarnaev brothers.
[01:08:33.036 --> 01:08:33.737]  Take this backpack.
[01:08:34.117 --> 01:08:34.297]  Yeah.
[01:08:35.208 --> 01:08:40.693]  I got a feeling they would make you a G-man.
[01:08:40.733 --> 01:08:43.375]  You come off, you're pretty slick and got the whole look going.
[01:08:43.956 --> 01:08:44.476]  Oh, thank you.
[01:08:44.997 --> 01:08:48.520]  We talked to C-Bell Edmonds and I was like, you know, how do they recruit these guys?
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:51.462]  And she was like, well, they like the young college guys, the athletic guys.
[01:08:51.522 --> 01:08:57.748]  It's helpful that they speak multiple languages, which I don't, so I guess that may have kept me from being a Patsy.
[01:09:00.185 --> 01:09:06.149]  Last year I also pledged to connect 99% of our students to high-speed broadband.
[01:09:06.169 --> 01:09:08.651]  So we can track everything you do and put it in a database.
[01:09:08.671 --> 01:09:08.651]  99%.
[01:09:08.691 --> 01:09:10.172]  He got money for all those.
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:27.282]  We're working to redesign high schools and partner them with colleges and employers that offer the real-world education and hands-on training
[01:09:40.327 --> 01:09:41.729]  That's Bill Gates stuff.
[01:09:42.009 --> 01:09:42.990]  That's school to work.
[01:09:43.450 --> 01:09:47.815]  We're going to engineer the economy where we decide what job you can have.
[01:09:47.915 --> 01:09:54.202]  And they redesigned the schools to be a simulation of living in a police state.
[01:09:54.662 --> 01:09:57.625]  It's a militarized police state compared to what I went to school in.
[01:10:02.674 --> 01:10:08.457]  And I want to work with Congress to see how we can help even more Americans who feel trapped by student loan debt.
[01:10:08.537 --> 01:10:13.620]  Well, how about you quit promising all these guys in college that they can get the dream job before they even graduate?
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:15.001]  I guess, you know, I'm accepted to the rule.
[01:10:15.041 --> 01:10:15.602]  That happened to me.
[01:10:15.862 --> 01:10:16.962]  But it doesn't happen to everybody.
[01:10:17.143 --> 01:10:17.903]  No, no, exactly.
[01:10:18.443 --> 01:10:19.084]  You know why?
[01:10:19.104 --> 01:10:21.205]  It wasn't your college that did it, which might have helped you.
[01:10:21.425 --> 01:10:22.225]  You did a good report.
[01:10:22.466 --> 01:10:23.086]  Yeah.
[01:10:23.166 --> 01:10:24.487]  And you were smart and good looking.
[01:10:24.967 --> 01:10:25.487]  Oh, thank you.
[01:10:25.507 --> 01:10:26.587]  That's what you say to all of us.
[01:10:26.607 --> 01:10:27.268]  No, I mean, come on.
[01:10:27.288 --> 01:10:27.808]  No, no, no.
[01:10:27.868 --> 01:10:28.948]  No, I mean, you're a handsome guy.
[01:10:29.268 --> 01:10:30.088]  You're well-spoken.
[01:10:30.348 --> 01:10:31.168]  You did a good report.
[01:10:31.208 --> 01:10:31.869]  We interviewed you.
[01:10:32.169 --> 01:10:33.089]  You were in Oklahoma.
[01:10:33.369 --> 01:10:34.349]  You ready to come down here?
[01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:35.489]  You've been here a year.
[01:10:35.529 --> 01:10:36.130]  You performed.
[01:10:36.150 --> 01:10:36.550]  You're in.
[01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:40.290]  Look, college didn't get you that job, Jakari.
[01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:41.331]  You doing that video did it.
[01:10:41.371 --> 01:10:41.731]  I know that.
[01:10:42.191 --> 01:10:42.931]  Let's get that straight.
[01:10:44.271 --> 01:10:47.072]  I mean, did you learn any of that in college, that broadcasting?
[01:10:47.731 --> 01:10:48.251]  Very little.
[01:10:48.511 --> 01:10:52.472]  You know, I learned some basic, basic editing.
[01:10:52.792 --> 01:10:57.253]  But, you know, the college I was in at the time wasn't really preparing me for what I do now.
[01:10:57.273 --> 01:11:04.195]  But, you know, if you'd have gone and got private lessons, they got companies that do that, it'd probably been one-tenth the video editing lessons.
[01:11:04.515 --> 01:11:06.416]  Again, it's free market education is the way to go.
[01:11:06.476 --> 01:11:07.796]  One-tenth the cost, one-tenth the time.
[01:11:07.876 --> 01:11:09.196]  I took an editing class.
[01:11:10.056 --> 01:11:11.597]  Three or four of them paid for them, like 200 bucks.
[01:11:13.194 --> 01:11:15.175]  I was in college at the time, and that's why I quit college.
[01:11:15.535 --> 01:11:20.918]  I was learning more in a two-hour class a week than I was learning in a semester at the community college.
[01:11:21.119 --> 01:11:24.340]  Because I was hands-on, folks showing me the stuff and how stuff really worked.
[01:11:25.421 --> 01:11:26.842]  Again, I'm not even knocking college.
[01:11:26.882 --> 01:11:30.444]  It would be good if they actually got back to really preparing me.
[01:11:30.804 --> 01:11:32.485]  Instead, they've become indoctrination centers.
[01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:34.126]  Here, let's clap for Obama right now.
[01:11:34.166 --> 01:11:34.446]  Come on.
[01:11:34.987 --> 01:11:35.367]  Come on.
[01:11:36.628 --> 01:11:36.908]  Come on.
[01:11:37.828 --> 01:11:40.510]  She deserves to have a baby without sacrificing her job.
[01:11:41.539 --> 01:11:42.700]  And sacrifice for the baby.
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.861]  To care for a sick child or a sick parent.
[01:11:46.881 --> 01:11:49.002]  But he wants to abort that baby as quickly as possible.
[01:11:49.602 --> 01:11:50.903]  He cares about babies, you hear that?
[01:11:50.923 --> 01:11:53.004]  Recognize the old man or whoever they got to take care of.
[01:11:53.084 --> 01:11:57.305]  It's time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a Mad Men episode.
[01:11:58.046 --> 01:11:59.766]  This year, let's all come together.
[01:12:00.267 --> 01:12:01.487]  Congress, the White House.
[01:12:01.507 --> 01:12:02.828]  They bring in Hollywood stuff.
[01:12:03.188 --> 01:12:07.310]  Wall Street to Main Street to give every woman the opportunity she deserves.
[01:12:08.874 --> 01:12:12.115]  I believe when women succeed, America succeeds.
[01:12:12.135 --> 01:12:13.315]  He cares about women.
[01:12:13.375 --> 01:12:14.336]  He said the same thing.
[01:12:14.376 --> 01:12:15.616]  Nobody else does but him.
[01:12:15.656 --> 01:12:16.617]  He's at the high ground.
[01:12:16.657 --> 01:12:20.798]  Why don't you lower the taxes so the wives don't have to work to make ends meet?
[01:12:21.358 --> 01:12:23.499]  You know, David, when you did that movie, what was it?
[01:12:23.859 --> 01:12:24.699]  It's a Wonderful Life.
[01:12:25.479 --> 01:12:31.822]  And the guy, he got a $30,000, or he was offered a $30,000 a year job, and he thought he was the richest guy in town.
[01:12:32.002 --> 01:12:35.643]  Because they destroyed the value of the currency, and if you look at what
[01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:43.419]  A family of five paid an income taxes back in the fifties, it was like two percent, what they were typically paying.
[01:12:43.699 --> 01:12:50.124]  And now what they've done is for the amount of money that the wife contributes to the family, that's what they've raised the taxes to.
[01:12:50.204 --> 01:13:00.573]  So basically she's working to pay the higher... And again, if she wants to work, that's fine, but the modern feminist movement was about ending families and making women work, because they're like, hell, 51% of the population
[01:13:02.674 --> 01:13:03.775]  51% women, it's even more now.
[01:13:04.195 --> 01:13:05.815]  Genetically, we have more women than men.
[01:13:06.235 --> 01:13:07.656]  We can make them work for us.
[01:13:08.076 --> 01:13:15.278]  But my point is, you're going to have single moms who have to work, of course, but a lot of women are working just to make ends meet.
[01:13:15.338 --> 01:13:16.779]  But he said he cares about women.
[01:13:16.799 --> 01:13:17.379]  He cares, not you!
[01:13:21.667 --> 01:13:23.707]  Five states have passed laws to raise theirs.
[01:13:23.808 --> 01:13:24.928]  They've devalued the currency.
[01:13:25.288 --> 01:13:26.968]  They've sold the jobs out.
[01:13:27.608 --> 01:13:30.349]  They've had Obamacare that makes you go to $30 an hour or less.
[01:13:31.049 --> 01:13:32.870]  And now they do need a raise, actually.
[01:13:33.150 --> 01:13:35.290]  The problem is it'll just make people let folks go.
[01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:37.131]  No entry-level jobs.
[01:13:37.551 --> 01:13:40.371]  All the economists show this, but he's gonna do it.
[01:13:40.952 --> 01:13:42.332]  Look, he's gonna give me money.
[01:13:43.092 --> 01:13:45.754]  Look, he's got earrings, he knows everything.
[01:13:45.815 --> 01:13:50.739]  Artificially raise the cost of the employees like Obamacare did, you're going to reduce employment.
[01:13:50.819 --> 01:13:52.280]  It's just that simple.
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:53.641]  People are not going to hire people that don't work.
[01:13:53.661 --> 01:13:58.766]  But that's okay because we went from 25 million on food stamps to 50 million under Obama, and that's a good thing.
[01:13:59.146 --> 01:14:02.789]  Working class people for the first time in history have to have it as a supplement.
[01:14:03.029 --> 01:14:04.130]  They need the government.
[01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:07.793]  Cloward and Piven, we need to bankrupt everybody to make them dependent.
[01:14:08.094 --> 01:14:08.894]  Yeah!
[01:14:09.315 --> 01:14:09.915]  Come on!
[01:14:11.857 --> 01:14:13.178]  Come on.
[01:14:13.218 --> 01:14:22.345]  To every mayor, governor, state legislator in America, I say you don't have to wait for Congress to act.
[01:14:23.526 --> 01:14:25.708]  Americans will support you if you take this on.
[01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:30.272]  And as a chief executive, I intend to lead by example.
[01:14:31.373 --> 01:14:37.458]  Profitable corporations like Costco see higher wages as the smart way to boost productivity.
[01:14:39.355 --> 01:14:43.196]  Ford did that when people weren't being paid a livable wage.
[01:14:43.236 --> 01:14:44.257]  He did it free market.
[01:14:44.997 --> 01:14:46.338]  You're not Henry Ford.
[01:14:46.378 --> 01:14:47.779]  God Almighty.
[01:14:47.979 --> 01:14:54.742]  When he mentions these corporation names, we ought to have like a cash register sound, like ka-ching, you know, because that's his product placement.
[01:14:55.422 --> 01:14:57.403]  Well, Costco's are big Democrats that give him money.
[01:14:57.944 --> 01:14:58.644]  That's on record.
[01:14:58.965 --> 01:15:02.927]  I was told by a major sponsor, because I criticized Costco one time, they left us.
[01:15:03.508 --> 01:15:05.369]  And they said, our products are in Costco stores.
[01:15:05.789 --> 01:15:06.690]  We've been told, drop you.
[01:15:07.230 --> 01:15:08.671]  That's how mafia these guys are.
[01:15:09.332 --> 01:15:10.132]  I'm not going to name names.
[01:15:10.632 --> 01:15:15.556]  Of course, to reach millions more, Congress does need to get on board.
[01:15:17.529 --> 01:15:19.811]  Today the federal minimum wage is worth about 20%.
[01:15:19.891 --> 01:15:21.673]  See, they're not on board.
[01:15:21.793 --> 01:15:23.314]  I'm trying to be a dictator.
[01:15:23.535 --> 01:15:25.256]  Look at this shot over here on the camera.
[01:15:25.456 --> 01:15:27.839]  Why do they not have any purchasing powers?
[01:15:27.919 --> 01:15:29.580]  Because they've inflated the currency.
[01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:31.001]  The Federal Reserve has inflated the currency.
[01:15:31.021 --> 01:15:33.043]  Why don't they ask why it doesn't have any purchasing power?
[01:15:33.504 --> 01:15:34.405]  It's an obvious answer.
[01:15:34.525 --> 01:15:36.607]  Look at these crooks.
[01:15:36.707 --> 01:15:39.069]  It'll give businesses customers with more money to spend.
[01:15:40.330 --> 01:15:43.773]  They just don't want the blame for what they're doing.
[01:15:44.193 --> 01:15:46.735]  This is to act like they're not the agenda 21.
[01:15:47.115 --> 01:15:48.336]  They're not the globalism.
[01:15:48.716 --> 01:15:50.718]  They're not the deindustrialization.
[01:15:51.338 --> 01:15:52.079]  It's Congress.
[01:15:52.099 --> 01:15:53.480]  They didn't do whatever I said.
[01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:56.181]  Even though they said you could do whatever you wanted on Obamacare.
[01:15:56.602 --> 01:15:57.482]  And spying.
[01:15:58.023 --> 01:15:59.524]  And the automakers.
[01:16:00.144 --> 01:16:00.805]  And NAFTA.
[01:16:00.865 --> 01:16:01.305]  And GATT.
[01:16:01.325 --> 01:16:02.426]  And all the new expansions.
[01:16:02.786 --> 01:16:04.387]  Just give the executive everything.
[01:16:04.407 --> 01:16:09.131]  There are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet.
[01:16:10.307 --> 01:16:17.532]  And few are more effective at reducing inequality and helping families pull themselves into hard work than the Earned Income Tax Credit.
[01:16:18.812 --> 01:16:22.395]  Right now, when you get a bunch of government help, it's like the kiss of death, you know what I'm saying?
[01:16:23.235 --> 01:16:26.937]  They can pull that Obama phone out of their hand anytime they want to.
[01:16:27.037 --> 01:16:28.819]  Well, they got people with 15 of them, does that help them?
[01:16:28.859 --> 01:16:34.102]  I agree with Republicans like Senator Rubio that it doesn't do enough for single workers who don't have kids.
[01:16:35.250 --> 01:16:36.991]  So let's work together to strengthen the credit.
[01:16:37.291 --> 01:16:39.532]  I'm a single worker who doesn't have kids.
[01:16:39.552 --> 01:16:42.413]  Listen, he just keeps saying, work together, work together.
[01:16:43.333 --> 01:16:44.034]  I'm here to help.
[01:16:44.054 --> 01:16:51.356]  He's seen in Saving Private Ryan, which is based on true events, where the guy's about to beat the Nazi soldier and they're in a knife fight.
[01:16:51.797 --> 01:16:53.377]  Then he goes, I'm friend, I'm friend, stop.
[01:16:53.677 --> 01:16:54.898]  The guy gives up for a minute.
[01:16:55.058 --> 01:16:57.299]  He sticks the knife in him.
[01:16:57.439 --> 01:16:58.319]  He sticks the knife in him.
[01:16:58.679 --> 01:17:04.682]  This is like, I'm your friend, work together, do what I want, I'm here to... He is, he's a baseball closer.
[01:17:06.129 --> 01:17:08.411]  And they know Americans are guilty about racism.
[01:17:08.771 --> 01:17:10.332]  They know we're guilty about inequality.
[01:17:11.073 --> 01:17:12.254]  Most countries aren't guilty about it.
[01:17:12.494 --> 01:17:12.694]  Right.
[01:17:13.014 --> 01:17:16.777]  America has been, compared to other countries, special in that we've had real fights.
[01:17:17.598 --> 01:17:21.420]  Long before the Civil War, it was people morally saying, we're against this.
[01:17:21.841 --> 01:17:24.503]  They almost had a civil war when the country first got started over slavery.
[01:17:25.236 --> 01:17:25.556]  I don't know.
[01:17:45.558 --> 01:17:47.381]  It doesn't mean we're great or high or mighty.
[01:17:47.901 --> 01:17:49.684]  It just means we've been better than other people.
[01:17:49.744 --> 01:17:50.144]  It's true.
[01:17:50.424 --> 01:17:51.966]  But we're not exceptional now.
[01:17:52.427 --> 01:17:56.272]  As Putin said, in goodness, we're exceptional in evil.
[01:17:56.913 --> 01:17:57.313]  Exactly.
[01:17:57.394 --> 01:17:57.894]  And BS.
[01:18:00.851 --> 01:18:06.616]  Future generations like the kids that get bombed by the drones like it was in Pakistan, 80% of the people killed.
[01:18:07.096 --> 01:18:09.178]  Pakistan Interior Minister said we're non-combatants.
[01:18:09.338 --> 01:18:13.482]  What about Obama cutting off real African aid and stuff that's killed?
[01:18:13.502 --> 01:18:15.804]  What about him saying Africans can't have air conditioning?
[01:18:16.264 --> 01:18:16.444]  Right.
[01:18:16.725 --> 01:18:21.331]  You know, he said, listen, I'm flying on a big jet, red carpet, you can't have a car or air conditioning.
[01:18:21.751 --> 01:18:23.694]  You gotta pay the globalists more money.
[01:18:24.295 --> 01:18:25.376]  He's saying, don't have a dream.
[01:18:25.917 --> 01:18:31.604]  By the way, they know if they industrialize it, it'll clean up the countries, they'll have less than two kids.
[01:18:31.764 --> 01:18:32.946]  Like every other country that does it.
[01:18:33.286 --> 01:18:33.646]  No, no, no.
[01:18:33.927 --> 01:18:35.909]  That's the World Commission on Population by the British.
[01:18:36.930 --> 01:18:35.909]  49.
[01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:41.354]  They said, let them industrialize in Latin America, Africa, and Asia.
[01:18:41.614 --> 01:18:42.735]  They'll have five, six kids.
[01:18:42.775 --> 01:18:43.596]  Half of them will die.
[01:18:43.616 --> 01:18:44.717]  It'll wreck their society.
[01:18:45.038 --> 01:18:46.419]  We can keep them down and control them.
[01:18:46.699 --> 01:18:51.984]  No, I want, like, I want my grandkids to go to African spaceports to blast off for Alpha Centauri.
[01:18:52.425 --> 01:18:54.106]  Like, you know, doing high fives with everybody.
[01:18:54.767 --> 01:18:56.648]  You know, I want a future for everybody.
[01:18:57.348 --> 01:18:59.549]  These people act like they're trying to help everybody.
[01:18:59.829 --> 01:19:02.810]  They're trying to suppress everybody so they can control them.
[01:19:03.170 --> 01:19:04.390]  That's what makes me angry.
[01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:07.751]  Africa's got more resources than any continent.
[01:19:08.591 --> 01:19:13.273]  Just like Mexico, in studies, I'm getting chills, has three times the resources of the U.S.
[01:19:13.673 --> 01:19:15.814]  But they can't do anything because they're corrupt.
[01:19:16.334 --> 01:19:17.954]  Well, that's why they focused on them at Bilderberg.
[01:19:18.174 --> 01:19:19.655]  They're going in to get those resources.
[01:19:20.415 --> 01:19:20.695]  Africa?
[01:19:20.935 --> 01:19:21.435]  Yeah, Africa.
[01:19:24.176 --> 01:19:33.002]  Drowning in trace elements, rare earth minerals, gold, silver, timber, resources, people, everything.
[01:19:33.262 --> 01:19:35.384]  The truth is the colonial powers never pulled out.
[01:19:35.844 --> 01:19:43.870]  They have just screwed that country, that whole region, eight different directions, and then they use guys like him while they're invading the destabilized sovereign countries.
[01:19:44.130 --> 01:19:47.572]  You try to mine your own diamonds in a country and don't pay De Beers in Oppenheimer?
[01:19:47.833 --> 01:19:49.914]  They invade you and claim it's a blood diamond.
[01:19:50.154 --> 01:19:56.767]  And they have Hollywood movies with Leonardo DiCaprio about how it's bad for Africa to sell its own diamonds to create a monopoly.
[01:19:57.428 --> 01:19:59.593]  And that's the model of everything they do.
[01:20:01.276 --> 01:20:02.158]  Any comments, Leanne?
[01:20:04.704 --> 01:20:06.565]  Oh, you've been here a long time, but you're doing a good job.
[01:20:07.385 --> 01:20:08.726]  Come on, tell us what you think about all this.
[01:20:09.066 --> 01:20:10.567]  What's it like to be here, ethically?
[01:20:10.827 --> 01:20:13.388]  I can tell the crowd is getting a little less enthused.
[01:20:13.508 --> 01:20:16.890]  Less people each time are standing up to cheer him on.
[01:20:17.330 --> 01:20:17.450]  Oh!
[01:20:17.810 --> 01:20:19.191]  Don't charge a woman more!
[01:20:19.631 --> 01:20:20.632]  I care about women!
[01:20:21.412 --> 01:20:22.713]  All the UN-run sex slaves.
[01:20:23.653 --> 01:20:24.794]  Minorities, I care about you.
[01:20:25.154 --> 01:20:26.054]  Women, I care about you.
[01:20:26.114 --> 01:20:26.675]  It's all talk.
[01:20:26.695 --> 01:20:33.058]  We did all this while adding years to Medicare's finances, keeping Medicare premiums flat,
[01:20:34.361 --> 01:20:37.045]  And lowering prescription costs for millions of seniors.
[01:20:37.085 --> 01:20:37.946]  They've all exploded.
[01:20:38.046 --> 01:20:40.209]  I mean, this is just... That was another BushCon game.
[01:20:40.349 --> 01:20:43.993]  I do not expect to convince my Republican friends on the merits of this law.
[01:20:45.575 --> 01:20:47.998]  Everybody knows Obamacare is a great deal!
[01:20:48.908 --> 01:20:49.709]  He's recycling his speech.
[01:20:49.749 --> 01:20:53.513]  I know that the American people are not interested in refighting old battles.
[01:20:54.054 --> 01:21:03.465]  So, again, if you have specific plans to cut costs, cover more people, increase choice, tell America what you do differently.
[01:21:03.485 --> 01:21:04.526]  Look at those mummies.
[01:21:04.727 --> 01:21:06.689]  Let's see if the numbers add up.
[01:21:07.694 --> 01:21:08.455]  That's the opposition.
[01:21:08.475 --> 01:21:13.298]  There should be black and hispanic and asian republican libertarians in there.
[01:21:13.398 --> 01:21:14.999]  Millions of americans like Amanda.
[01:21:15.019 --> 01:21:15.439]  There aren't.
[01:21:15.479 --> 01:21:16.580]  I mean this is disgusting.
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:17.481]  That's why we're screwed.
[01:21:18.161 --> 01:21:19.182]  I mean this is disgusting.
[01:21:21.735 --> 01:21:23.055]  See, I'm like Martin Luther King.
[01:21:23.535 --> 01:21:27.476]  I care about your brain and what you stand for and the character and what you've done.
[01:21:27.877 --> 01:21:30.297]  These people are all about how much BS you got.
[01:21:31.017 --> 01:21:34.078]  Let me show... It's like Show Me State, Missouri.
[01:21:34.618 --> 01:21:35.719]  What have you done?
[01:21:36.239 --> 01:21:37.239]  What do you do?
[01:21:37.719 --> 01:21:38.899]  What do you stand for?
[01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:40.440]  Who are you?
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:42.620]  Not what BS comes out of your mouth.
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:43.361]  Right.
[01:21:43.721 --> 01:21:44.601]  God Almighty.
[01:21:44.961 --> 01:21:48.502]  I mean, as much as I hate Obama, I look at these Republicans, I want to throw up.
[01:21:49.474 --> 01:21:51.496]  A bunch of power-tripping people.
[01:21:51.716 --> 01:21:52.337]  Old people.
[01:21:52.497 --> 01:21:55.279]  I don't think it's old people, but they're old evil people.
[01:21:55.420 --> 01:22:02.406]  And if you want to know the real impact this law is having, just talk to Governor Steve Beshear of Kentucky, who's here tonight.
[01:22:03.307 --> 01:22:05.409]  Now, Kentucky is not the most liberal part of the country.
[01:22:07.162 --> 01:22:12.965]  He's here to sell out when on record 200,000 people lost their health care in Kentucky.
[01:22:13.886 --> 01:22:18.428]  It was like, Governor, you're here, I'm giving you 30 seconds on TV, you narcissistic turd.
[01:22:19.429 --> 01:22:24.352]  So sit here and act like you care about all this and play games.
[01:22:24.612 --> 01:22:26.233]  200,000 lost their insurance.
[01:22:26.313 --> 01:22:34.537]  We're going to make all those old Appalachian people that literally live on $200 a month and are starving to death, we're going to give them a free deal.
[01:22:35.077 --> 01:22:35.818]  Turn up his BS.
[01:22:37.816 --> 01:22:38.279]  Steve's right.
[01:22:39.687 --> 01:22:46.128]  That's why tonight I ask every American who knows someone without health insurance to help them get covered by March 31st.
[01:22:46.368 --> 01:22:47.729]  Yeah, get them enrolled.
[01:22:47.789 --> 01:22:51.870]  Take them out to the big box stores so they can go to the Obamacare pod.
[01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.570]  Like you did.
[01:22:52.610 --> 01:22:56.771]  Yeah, and they can be diagnosed with obesity.
[01:22:56.811 --> 01:22:57.851]  You're obese?
[01:22:57.891 --> 01:22:58.811]  Would you like a pill?
[01:22:59.151 --> 01:22:59.391]  Yes.
[01:22:59.571 --> 01:23:02.092]  It didn't spit out the pill, but I don't think it's too far from that.
[01:23:02.152 --> 01:23:06.473]  Well, we know a lot of people who lost their health insurance because they can't afford the new policy.
[01:23:06.513 --> 01:23:07.613]  It's more than their home payment.
[01:23:08.823 --> 01:23:09.003]  Right?
[01:23:09.203 --> 01:23:15.466]  They're mandated that they've got to buy all this stuff that they don't need because it was the insurance companies that wrote these policies.
[01:23:15.506 --> 01:23:18.328]  It's the insurance companies that are benefiting from this, not the American public.
[01:23:18.968 --> 01:23:23.070]  Well, the spirit of citizenship, he wants to make this about black, white, Hispanic.
[01:23:23.650 --> 01:23:26.532]  I don't care about a computer in my house that was black, white, or purple.
[01:23:27.412 --> 01:23:27.993]  Or green.
[01:23:28.473 --> 01:23:29.634]  I want the computer to work.
[01:23:30.134 --> 01:23:31.034]  I want it to be good.
[01:23:31.134 --> 01:23:33.736]  Well, we're a free computer with a spirit.
[01:23:34.976 --> 01:23:36.557]  And the thing he's selling is a fraud.
[01:23:36.797 --> 01:23:38.278]  I mean, the whole world's wide open.
[01:23:39.909 --> 01:23:43.270]  To coming to America, but the rest of the world's not open to us going there.
[01:23:44.010 --> 01:23:55.294]  I mean, I can't move anywhere without literally paying him hundreds of thousands of dollars, showing I have a job, and he's saying we're not nice if we don't let all these illegals in when the rest of the world's shut down but open to America.
[01:23:55.714 --> 01:23:58.615]  I mean, it's just a fraud, and they use our goodwill to do this.
[01:23:58.755 --> 01:23:59.515]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:23:59.836 --> 01:24:03.777]  Conservative Republicans and Liberal Democrats are working together to strengthen it.
[01:24:04.037 --> 01:24:05.257]  Because big banks want it, yeah.
[01:24:05.277 --> 01:24:06.738]  The bipartisan commission I appointed.
[01:24:07.418 --> 01:24:13.680]  Well, when you hear something bipartisan, the elite wants it, you know it's like cancer, run the other direction.
[01:24:13.941 --> 01:24:15.321]  Bipartisan wants your guns.
[01:24:15.641 --> 01:24:16.862]  Bipartisan wants a war.
[01:24:17.202 --> 01:24:20.703]  Bipartisan wants socialist health care.
[01:24:20.743 --> 01:24:22.344]  The Republicans help write this thing.
[01:24:23.104 --> 01:24:24.205]  That's why they won't repeal it.
[01:24:24.485 --> 01:24:25.565]  Because they help write it.
[01:24:26.165 --> 01:24:28.386]  As the wet dream of the big insurance companies.
[01:24:29.247 --> 01:24:33.248]  It looks just like Romney's health care policy that he had in Massachusetts that he wrote with Ted Kennedy.
[01:24:34.208 --> 01:24:35.209]  They admit that's the model.
[01:24:36.769 --> 01:24:37.330]  Bipartisan.
[01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:41.874]  Citizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals.
[01:24:41.894 --> 01:24:42.395]  There you go!
[01:24:42.455 --> 01:24:44.037]  Voting to take my guns.
[01:24:44.057 --> 01:24:44.477]  I told you.
[01:24:44.497 --> 01:24:45.178]  I want to hear this.
[01:24:45.238 --> 01:24:54.248]  I've seen the courage of parents, students, pastors, police officers all over this country who say, we are not afraid.
[01:24:55.373 --> 01:25:06.236]  And I intend to keep trying, with or without Congress, to help stop more tragedies from visiting innocent Americans in our movie theaters, our shopping malls, more schools like Sandy Hook.
[01:25:06.296 --> 01:25:08.637]  They are teaching them to vote and take our guns.
[01:25:08.657 --> 01:25:12.958]  While he goes down to Mexico and says the Mexican drug violence is because of the U.S.
[01:25:13.038 --> 01:25:16.339]  Second Amendment, even though he's running guns down there with Operation Fast and Furious.
[01:25:16.359 --> 01:25:17.740]  To blame the Second Amendment.
[01:25:19.138 --> 01:25:20.239]  What do you say to that, Jakari?
[01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:21.721]  Well, he talked about the pastors.
[01:25:21.741 --> 01:25:26.947]  You know, we got pastors, guys like Terry Holcomb, who was arrested for open-carrying his gun.
[01:25:26.967 --> 01:25:28.328]  We have veterans like C.J.
[01:25:28.368 --> 01:25:28.729]  Grisham.
[01:25:29.029 --> 01:25:32.793]  We got moms like Victoria and all the other people in the open-carry group.
[01:25:32.833 --> 01:25:33.995]  But he doesn't want to talk about that.
[01:25:35.089 --> 01:25:43.597]  I know this chamber agrees that few Americans give more to their country than our diplomats and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces.
[01:25:44.137 --> 01:25:52.605]  Man, he is connecting citizenship and turning our guns in, screwing the military, and getting our guns.
[01:25:52.725 --> 01:25:53.626]  I mean, I told you.
[01:25:53.666 --> 01:25:54.406]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:25:54.587 --> 01:25:55.167]  What was that, Crew?
[01:25:58.740 --> 01:25:58.900]  Yeah.
[01:25:59.401 --> 01:26:00.662]  Oh yeah, all the diplomats they kill.
[01:26:00.943 --> 01:26:03.666]  What about how they're hiring all those diplomats who don't even know what country they're working for?
[01:26:03.686 --> 01:26:06.089]  Yeah, we were talking about that earlier today.
[01:26:08.492 --> 01:26:09.754]  Look at that military brass.
[01:26:09.774 --> 01:26:11.015]  Do they not look like a group?
[01:26:11.035 --> 01:26:12.577]  I think that's the first time they've stood up.
[01:26:12.597 --> 01:26:14.900]  Yeah, that's the only time they've stood up to.
[01:26:18.968 --> 01:26:23.594]  Well look, you're supposed to... If we had a great president, I wouldn't want everybody applauding.
[01:26:23.634 --> 01:26:24.335]  This is dangerous.
[01:26:25.217 --> 01:26:27.740]  We need balkanization and separation of powers.
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:31.565]  When I took office, nearly 180,000 Americans were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:26:37.213 --> 01:26:39.534]  Today, all our troops are out of Iraq.
[01:26:39.854 --> 01:26:40.254]  Lie!
[01:26:40.834 --> 01:26:44.115]  More than 60,000 of our troops have already come home from Afghanistan.
[01:26:44.135 --> 01:26:45.616]  Yeah, one group, they beefed up the other.
[01:26:45.776 --> 01:26:46.336]  This is all lies.
[01:26:46.416 --> 01:26:48.857]  Afghan forces now in the lead for their own security.
[01:26:49.377 --> 01:26:51.278]  Our troops have moved to a support role.
[01:26:52.218 --> 01:26:55.739]  Together with our allies, we will complete our mission there by the end of this year.
[01:26:55.839 --> 01:27:00.561]  And by the way, they've moved them to Africa, Latin America, and Asia.
[01:27:01.321 --> 01:27:02.982]  They're just moving them to other theaters.
[01:27:07.950 --> 01:27:10.831]  He's now saying 2020 for the troops out of Afghanistan.
[01:27:10.991 --> 01:27:11.491]  Oh, that's nice.
[01:27:11.751 --> 01:27:15.372]  He promises what second year in office he'd have them out.
[01:27:15.392 --> 01:27:21.334]  After 2014, we will support a unified Afghanistan as it takes responsibility for its own future.
[01:27:21.594 --> 01:27:23.274]  You mean with our own opium production.
[01:27:23.294 --> 01:27:31.596]  If the Afghan government signs a security agreement that we have negotiated, a small force of Americans could remain in Afghanistan with NATO allies.
[01:27:31.616 --> 01:27:33.157]  They're having the military rotate out.
[01:27:33.217 --> 01:27:34.717]  I've got family involved.
[01:27:35.057 --> 01:27:36.038]  They're just called contractors.
[01:27:36.058 --> 01:27:37.138]  We're not resisting Afghan forces.
[01:27:38.392 --> 01:27:39.533]  Or they put U.S.
[01:27:39.573 --> 01:27:43.476]  military under NATO so they don't count them.
[01:27:43.796 --> 01:27:44.777]  Oh, you're now NATO.
[01:27:44.837 --> 01:27:49.961]  I mean, I have family over there now that's been told, next year you're going to be called NATO.
[01:27:50.281 --> 01:27:51.962]  But it's still U.S.
[01:27:52.002 --> 01:27:52.403]  military.
[01:27:52.743 --> 01:27:53.483]  Army.
[01:27:57.326 --> 01:28:00.008]  Like you said, David, it's all semantical changes.
[01:28:06.237 --> 01:28:07.941]  But I guess on paper it makes it true.
[01:28:08.302 --> 01:28:08.764]  Like U.S.
[01:28:08.804 --> 01:28:11.270]  military's pulling out, they're now gonna be called NATO.
[01:28:12.353 --> 01:28:12.935]  The fact is...
[01:28:14.013 --> 01:28:14.914]  That danger remains.
[01:28:15.174 --> 01:28:17.456]  The fact is we're funding Al-Qaeda all over the world.
[01:28:17.476 --> 01:28:20.198]  We've put Al-Qaeda's core leadership on a path to defeat.
[01:28:20.739 --> 01:28:21.980]  The threat has evolved.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.641]  By giving them aid.
[01:28:23.681 --> 01:28:26.243]  Extremists take root in different parts of the world.
[01:28:26.523 --> 01:28:28.365]  Like Libya, where you backed them, and Syria.
[01:28:28.385 --> 01:28:28.725]  Yemen.
[01:28:29.246 --> 01:28:29.806]  Somalia.
[01:28:30.527 --> 01:28:30.867]  Egypt.
[01:28:31.187 --> 01:28:32.508]  Those are just J.V.
[01:28:32.648 --> 01:28:32.949]  Al-Qaeda.
[01:28:32.969 --> 01:28:34.150]  Remember when he called them J.V.?
[01:28:34.350 --> 01:28:35.090]  Junior Varsity.
[01:28:35.130 --> 01:28:36.351]  Yeah, they were Junior Varsity Al-Qaeda.
[01:28:36.371 --> 01:28:37.733]  Those are the good guys, the J.V.
[01:28:37.833 --> 01:28:38.293]  Al-Qaeda.
[01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:40.795]  Well, see, Al-Qaeda said we should support them.
[01:28:40.835 --> 01:28:42.336]  That rejects the agenda.
[01:28:43.177 --> 01:28:43.717]  We're good to go.
[01:29:15.998 --> 01:29:17.339]  Well, now the Republicans stand up.
[01:29:17.799 --> 01:29:20.360]  Yeah, let's kill some Al-Qaeda!
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:23.281]  We have to remain vigilant.
[01:29:24.922 --> 01:29:31.505]  But I strongly believe our leadership and our security cannot depend on our outstanding military alone.
[01:29:31.925 --> 01:29:33.045]  We need NSA!
[01:29:33.065 --> 01:29:34.386]  NSA!
[01:29:34.546 --> 01:29:37.987]  I have used force when needed to protect the American people.
[01:29:38.408 --> 01:29:41.529]  And I will never hesitate to do so as long as I hold this office.
[01:29:42.947 --> 01:29:51.853]  But I will not send our troops into harm's way unless it is truly necessary, nor will I allow our sons and daughters to be mired in open-ended conflicts.
[01:29:52.974 --> 01:29:55.596]  We must fight the battles that need to be fought.
[01:29:56.056 --> 01:29:58.298]  Not those that terrorists prefer from us.
[01:29:59.099 --> 01:30:03.662]  Large-scale deployments that drain our strength and may ultimately feed extremism.
[01:30:05.522 --> 01:30:10.344]  What feeds extremism is the murdering of innocent people with his drone.
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:31.383]  He's losing his, uh, fervor that he had at the beginning of the thing.
[01:30:31.563 --> 01:30:32.604]  He's very serious.
[01:30:33.365 --> 01:30:37.248]  If people abroad believe we strike within their countries without regard for the consequences.
[01:30:37.268 --> 01:30:37.789]  Oh, drones.
[01:30:37.809 --> 01:30:39.070]  You said we've got drones.
[01:30:39.090 --> 01:30:39.850]  You said we've got drones.
[01:30:39.870 --> 01:30:41.151]  Are you psychic?
[01:30:41.271 --> 01:30:42.593]  I didn't think you were talking about drones.
[01:30:42.813 --> 01:30:43.733]  Well, that's the big thing.
[01:30:43.753 --> 01:30:45.935]  They're going to be in the sky en masse.
[01:30:45.995 --> 01:30:50.719]  I guess it means we attack countries we're not even at war with, outside Geneva Convention.
[01:30:50.759 --> 01:30:52.361]  Warming people is not being violated.
[01:30:54.636 --> 01:30:59.478]  Well, and he said those people believe that their rights are being violated when they're innocently killed.
[01:30:59.598 --> 01:31:02.459]  It's like, we had a wedding, we killed 20 of you to kill one guy.
[01:31:03.279 --> 01:31:11.323]  This needs to be the year Congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.
[01:31:11.343 --> 01:31:12.363]  They move it someplace else.
[01:31:12.423 --> 01:31:15.604]  He's spinning it to total black sides, total ghost sides.
[01:31:16.085 --> 01:31:18.025]  We want to move to total torture sides.
[01:31:18.466 --> 01:31:19.526]  Let me do whatever I want.
[01:31:19.566 --> 01:31:20.366]  Ten times worse.
[01:31:21.647 --> 01:31:24.248]  And it's Congress' fault that Gitmo's still operating, not his.
[01:31:26.857 --> 01:31:28.658]  Why doesn't he use his magic pen to close it?
[01:31:28.678 --> 01:31:30.019]  In a world of complex threats.
[01:31:30.419 --> 01:31:32.040]  Yeah, he could act unilaterally.
[01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:35.201]  He doesn't want the military, the marines, to control the prison.
[01:31:35.221 --> 01:31:40.764]  He wants the CIA contractors to put a bag over whoever's head they want.
[01:31:41.864 --> 01:31:44.826]  American diplomacy has rallied more than 50 countries.
[01:31:44.846 --> 01:31:47.987]  What's it like when you know all the facts and you study them at sea?
[01:31:48.007 --> 01:31:49.488]  What you know, the public doesn't know.
[01:31:49.528 --> 01:31:50.729]  How frustrating is it, Jakari?
[01:31:52.203 --> 01:31:55.404]  It is very frustrating, but I meet a lot of awake people on the streets.
[01:31:55.444 --> 01:31:56.584]  No, I know, but let's face it.
[01:31:56.724 --> 01:31:57.845]  We study this all day.
[01:31:58.185 --> 01:32:00.105]  What is it like to know the facts and then watch this?
[01:32:00.305 --> 01:32:07.507]  Well, I mean, just to see all the lies and all the BS and the half-truths and the flat-out lies that the guy pushes out there.
[01:32:07.927 --> 01:32:12.508]  It's very frustrating that many people will watch this and think that because he's saying it, he'd be in a suit.
[01:32:12.748 --> 01:32:13.089]  I agree.
[01:32:13.129 --> 01:32:14.609]  The Syrian people, though, Ja'kari.
[01:32:16.380 --> 01:32:19.062]  As we speak, American diplomacy is supported.
[01:32:19.542 --> 01:32:20.883]  Israelis and Palestinians.
[01:32:20.903 --> 01:32:23.065]  Three years ago they started funding Al Qaeda.
[01:32:23.325 --> 01:32:26.187]  They said we had to bomb them five months ago, there'd be nuclear war.
[01:32:26.927 --> 01:32:29.449]  The military and the public and all of us here backed them off.
[01:32:29.709 --> 01:32:32.651]  Now he's taking credit for the diplomacy he fought against.
[01:32:32.691 --> 01:32:33.072]  Go ahead.
[01:32:34.152 --> 01:32:37.635]  A Jewish state that knows America will always be at their side.
[01:32:37.655 --> 01:32:42.178]  Is that Rohrabacher over there?
[01:32:47.432 --> 01:32:49.273]  That's weird, I've interviewed like half these people.
[01:32:53.996 --> 01:33:07.083]  And it is American diplomacy, backed by pressure, that has halted the progress of Iran's nuclear program and rolled back parts of that program for the very first time in a decade.
[01:33:08.462 --> 01:33:14.243]  Was it American diplomacy when Prince Bondar threatened Putin about the Olympics?
[01:33:14.583 --> 01:33:16.124]  And they did bomb him.
[01:33:16.204 --> 01:33:20.584]  I guess you could call that... It's not installing advanced centrifuges.
[01:33:21.545 --> 01:33:23.485]  What are you making of this?
[01:33:24.025 --> 01:33:30.046]  Well, it surprises me that... Does anyone care that he's recycling the same exact things that he said?
[01:33:30.186 --> 01:33:32.067]  I mean, these are all the things that were on the table.
[01:33:32.147 --> 01:33:34.727]  So it's just the same BS, the same lies.
[01:33:34.847 --> 01:33:36.028]  Nothing happened last year.
[01:33:36.088 --> 01:33:37.728]  No change is going to happen this year.
[01:33:39.178 --> 01:33:40.559]  It's called New Lies for Old.
[01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:42.141]  Or Old Lies for Old.
[01:33:42.941 --> 01:33:43.962]  What would you call it, Jakari?
[01:33:44.783 --> 01:33:46.244]  I call it BS, is what I call it.
[01:33:46.985 --> 01:33:55.753]  Well, why do we put up with this year after year, and then these people sit in the seats like, you know, that something's really going to happen.
[01:33:55.773 --> 01:33:57.815]  I mean, don't they get tired of this?
[01:33:57.835 --> 01:34:01.578]  How many years has it been promising to get rid of Gitmo?
[01:34:02.304 --> 01:34:04.586]  And of course, they all said, oh, that's... Nine years.
[01:34:04.646 --> 01:34:05.206]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:34:05.226 --> 01:34:06.187]  He did it a year before I ran away.
[01:34:06.207 --> 01:34:07.948]  But now he's saying he has no control over it.
[01:34:08.068 --> 01:34:09.009]  I mean, come on.
[01:34:09.389 --> 01:34:09.629]  Yeah.
[01:34:10.469 --> 01:34:15.913]  I thought he has unilateral... But he wants, he says, get rid of it with something much, much worse.
[01:34:15.933 --> 01:34:16.333]  Oh, yeah.
[01:34:17.554 --> 01:34:19.896]  But these negotiations don't rely on trust.
[01:34:20.016 --> 01:34:20.856]  We're now at one hour.
[01:34:21.457 --> 01:34:21.857]  One hour.
[01:34:21.977 --> 01:34:24.179]  Any long-term deal we agree to... Of this bomb.
[01:34:24.199 --> 01:34:29.562]  ...must be based on verifiable action that convinces us and the international community... Verifiable.
[01:34:29.582 --> 01:34:32.004]  ...that Iran is not building a nuclear bomb.
[01:34:33.621 --> 01:34:43.169]  If John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan could negotiate with the Soviet Union, then surely a strong and confident America can negotiate with less powerful adversaries today.
[01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:47.172]  And now he's acting like he's in diplomacy with Iran.
[01:34:47.533 --> 01:34:49.174]  He failed at overthrowing Syria.
[01:34:49.614 --> 01:34:51.356]  They've already got nukes.
[01:34:51.416 --> 01:34:54.659]  I've got special warfare top people telling me.
[01:34:54.679 --> 01:34:58.021]  The sanctions that we put in place help make this opportunity possible.
[01:34:59.923 --> 01:35:00.664]  But let me be clear.
[01:35:02.028 --> 01:35:08.675]  If this Congress sends me a new sanctions bill now that threatens to derail these talks, I will veto it.
[01:35:12.479 --> 01:35:15.442]  For the sake of our national security.
[01:35:15.682 --> 01:35:17.464]  They're just acting like they're friends with Iran.
[01:35:17.484 --> 01:35:20.127]  They're going to attack them later.
[01:35:20.247 --> 01:35:22.590]  This is all so they act like they did diplomacy.
[01:35:25.569 --> 01:35:30.192]  If Iran's leaders do not seize this opportunity, then I will be the first to call for more sanctions.
[01:35:30.212 --> 01:35:30.712]  There you go.
[01:35:31.032 --> 01:35:35.635]  And stand ready to exercise all offers to make sure Iran's leaders... Well, that's why Obama's slick.
[01:35:35.695 --> 01:35:37.176]  Let me tell you, they got a good guy.
[01:35:37.196 --> 01:35:41.158]  They couldn't find anybody but him that could be this good.
[01:35:41.198 --> 01:35:42.639]  I mean, he's a great quarterback for them.
[01:35:43.179 --> 01:35:44.600]  He's a really good con artist.
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:46.101]  He delivers the B.S.
[01:35:46.141 --> 01:35:46.941]  like nobody I've ever seen.
[01:35:46.961 --> 01:35:48.042]  Well, that's why they're all clapping.
[01:35:48.062 --> 01:35:49.063]  That makes it even more evil.
[01:35:49.603 --> 01:35:50.303]  It's unbelievable.
[01:35:50.383 --> 01:35:51.644]  He's good at this.
[01:35:51.684 --> 01:35:53.285]  He's really good at selling this.
[01:35:53.965 --> 01:35:54.726]  The risks of war.
[01:35:57.353 --> 01:36:11.668]  Finally, let's remember that our leadership is defined not as threats, but by the enormous opportunities to do good and promote understanding around the globe.
[01:36:12.008 --> 01:36:14.211]  To forge greater cooperation.
[01:36:14.231 --> 01:36:15.232]  To expand new markets.
[01:36:16.704 --> 01:36:18.866]  To free people from fear and want.
[01:36:19.286 --> 01:36:20.487]  From fear while they hype it.
[01:36:20.707 --> 01:36:21.188]  And no one.
[01:36:21.688 --> 01:36:24.350]  Hey listen, I'm going to do this now.
[01:36:24.410 --> 01:36:27.893]  I'm going to go watch you guys in the director's booth.
[01:36:28.093 --> 01:36:30.675]  I'm going to let you finish up and I want you guys to spend 15-20 minutes.
[01:36:32.793 --> 01:36:34.054]  From Tunisia to Burma.
[01:36:55.050 --> 01:36:59.314]  I want you to break down for 20 minutes after this what you've witnessed.
[01:37:00.055 --> 01:37:01.796]  But God, this has gone on for an hour now.
[01:37:01.897 --> 01:37:05.099]  I want to thank all the viewers out there and subscribers.
[01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:10.845]  PrisonPlanet.tv, you wouldn't see original info like this if it wasn't for your support.
[01:37:10.925 --> 01:37:17.250]  So you support us by free will with your purchases and memberships and Poor'sLife.com and everything else.
[01:37:17.831 --> 01:37:19.713]  Alright, let's go to full screen for now.
[01:37:22.338 --> 01:37:35.043]  As we did in the Philippines, when our Marines and civilians rushed to aid those battered by a typhoon, and who are greeted with words like, we will never forget your kindness, and God bless America.
[01:37:37.504 --> 01:37:41.506]  We do these things because they help promote our long-term security.
[01:37:43.006 --> 01:37:51.350]  And we do them because we believe in the inherent dignity and equality of every human being, regardless of race or religion.
[01:37:52.438 --> 01:37:53.139]  We're good to go.
[01:38:23.925 --> 01:38:29.048]  My fellow Americans, no other country in the world does what we do.
[01:38:31.129 --> 01:38:33.650]  On every issue, the world turns to us.
[01:38:35.191 --> 01:38:45.015]  Not simply because of the size of our economy or our military might, but because of the ideals we stand for, and the burdens we bear to advance them.
[01:38:47.857 --> 01:38:50.138]  No one knows this better than those who serve in uniform.
[01:38:52.352 --> 01:38:58.417]  As this time of war draws to a close, a new generation of heroes returns to civilian life.
[01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:10.348]  We'll keep slashing that backlog so our veterans receive the benefits they've earned and our wounded warriors receive the health care, including the mental health care, that they need.
[01:39:28.635 --> 01:39:33.916]  We'll keep working to help all our veterans translate their skills and leadership into jobs here at home.
[01:39:35.456 --> 01:39:40.757]  And we will all continue to join forces to honor and support our remarkable military families.
[01:39:44.158 --> 01:39:47.179]  Let me tell you about one of those families I've come to know.
[01:39:49.319 --> 01:39:54.120]  I first met Corey Remsburg, a proud Army Ranger.
[01:39:55.831 --> 01:40:05.159]  At Omaha Beach, on the 65th anniversary of D-Day, along with some of his fellow Rangers, he walked me through the program and the ceremony.
[01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:07.662]  He was a strong, impressive young man.
[01:40:08.002 --> 01:40:08.803]  He had an easy manner.
[01:40:09.063 --> 01:40:09.964]  He was sharp as a tack.
[01:40:10.764 --> 01:40:12.946]  And we joked around and took pictures.
[01:40:13.447 --> 01:40:14.448]  I told him to stay in touch.
[01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:20.053]  A few months later, on his 10th deployment,
[01:40:21.618 --> 01:40:26.000]  Cory was nearly killed by a massive roadside bomb in Afghanistan.
[01:40:28.361 --> 01:40:34.123]  His comrades found him in a canal, face down, underwater, shrapnel in his brain.
[01:40:36.664 --> 01:40:38.665]  For months, he lay in a coma.
[01:40:40.185 --> 01:40:46.188]  The next time I met him in the hospital, he couldn't speak, could barely move.
[01:40:48.689 --> 01:40:56.472]  Over the years, he's endured dozens of surgeries and procedures, hours of grueling rehab every day.
[01:40:58.873 --> 01:41:03.394]  Even now, Cory is still blind in one eye, still struggles on his left side.
[01:41:05.395 --> 01:41:15.219]  But slowly, steadily, with the support of caregivers like his dad, Craig, and the community around him, Cory has grown stronger.
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:17.860]  Day by day,
[01:41:18.496 --> 01:41:22.718]  He's learned to speak again, and stand again, and walk again.
[01:41:24.279 --> 01:41:27.660]  He's working toward the day when he can serve his country again.
[01:41:30.801 --> 01:41:33.262]  My recovery has not been easy, he says.
[01:41:35.663 --> 01:41:39.065]  Nothing in life that's worth anything is easy.
[01:41:42.426 --> 01:41:45.568]  Cory is here tonight, and like the army he loves,
[01:41:46.670 --> 01:41:47.853]  Like the America he serves.
[01:41:48.936 --> 01:41:53.428]  Sergeant First Class Corey Ramsburg never gives up and he does not quit.
[01:42:51.044 --> 01:42:54.887]  I'm just so disgusted to see them using this guy as window dressing.
[01:42:54.947 --> 01:42:56.568]  They've used him ten deployments.
[01:42:56.608 --> 01:42:57.128]  Did you hear that?
[01:42:57.288 --> 01:42:58.289]  Ten deployments.
[01:42:58.829 --> 01:43:04.633]  I mean, do they care about the people in the USS Reagan that they exposed to radiation needlessly at Fukushima?
[01:43:05.013 --> 01:43:06.114]  Didn't give them any protection.
[01:43:06.354 --> 01:43:10.177]  They don't protect any of the people at Fallujah that were using the depleted uranium.
[01:43:10.597 --> 01:43:11.718]  They use these people.
[01:43:12.338 --> 01:43:18.100]  They use these people, and he's being used right now to support an unjustifiable war.
[01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:18.880]  Exactly.
[01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:24.562]  You heard Obama talk about getting the people the treatment that they needed, the soldiers the treatment that they need.
[01:43:24.822 --> 01:43:30.484]  But when you send guys out there for 10 deployments, I can't blame them for coming back, you know, a little shell-shocked.
[01:43:32.115 --> 01:43:34.336]  They need to just stop the war.
[01:43:34.876 --> 01:43:41.921]  He's been there for five years, and he's not only continued these wars, but he's tried to get us involved in additional wars, and we stopped it this last year.
[01:43:42.602 --> 01:43:43.042]  Exactly.
[01:43:43.362 --> 01:43:51.227]  We had a conflict, I guess still have the ongoing conflict potentially with Syria, and you know they want to beat the war drums on that, but also other things happening as well.
[01:43:51.248 --> 01:43:51.328]  Yeah.
[01:43:52.329 --> 01:43:55.155]  Alright, and that's why they're getting everyone to clap for the military.
[01:43:55.256 --> 01:43:57.882]  10th deployment, let's give them a round of applause.
[01:43:59.004 --> 01:44:01.169]  They need to keep sending them out there to go die.
[01:44:02.168 --> 01:44:11.937]  I look at this, and tonight there's a lot that we didn't hear because, frankly, we were talking, but when we look at this transcript, what's really going to be interesting is when we look at this a year from now.
[01:44:12.418 --> 01:44:19.144]  Because I went back and I looked at his State of the Union addresses that he's had each of the previous years, and it's amazing the lies that he's told.
[01:44:19.224 --> 01:44:26.111]  And some of them just absolute blatant lies, but then a lot of these, you don't see the lie until the Obamacare kicks in, or whatever.
[01:44:26.271 --> 01:44:28.633]  I mean, he was telling lies about climate change.
[01:44:28.673 --> 01:44:31.775]  He was saying that for 12 of the last 15 years we've had warming.
[01:44:31.815 --> 01:44:32.796]  He said that last year.
[01:44:33.336 --> 01:44:34.057]  That's not true.
[01:44:34.177 --> 01:44:35.138]  It's exactly the opposite.
[01:44:35.158 --> 01:44:38.080]  I believe he said something about global warming in his inauguration.
[01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:38.900]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:44:39.141 --> 01:44:43.804]  But I mean, the IPCC is saying, what are we going to do?
[01:44:43.824 --> 01:44:48.187]  We need to address the fact that we don't have global warming, that we haven't had it, that it's a trend.
[01:44:48.548 --> 01:44:51.910]  And yet he said exactly the opposite when he was talking about it.
[01:44:52.050 --> 01:44:53.091]  I've got the quote here.
[01:44:53.151 --> 01:44:58.897]  Yeah, you know, David, we have so much global warming that they're actually considering pushing back the Super Bowl because they have so much snow up there.
[01:44:59.017 --> 01:45:01.580]  That's your global warming at work.
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:09.569]  That's why he doesn't care about the facts, though, because he's going to have his executive authority to just go ahead and sign climate change bills.
[01:45:10.333 --> 01:45:15.978]  Well, you know, what's interesting is, if we look at what he said in 2013 about the NSA, essentially, right?
[01:45:16.339 --> 01:45:22.865]  Now, remember that last year, 2013, when he did this address, he was a couple of months away from the Snowden leaks.
[01:45:23.426 --> 01:45:26.669]  Okay, and what he was saying in that, he says, we have kept Congress fully informed.
[01:45:26.909 --> 01:45:31.072]  Well, it was a couple of months after that that they had Clapper lie into Congress and say, no, there is no program.
[01:45:31.513 --> 01:45:32.373]  And Congress knew that.
[01:45:32.754 --> 01:45:34.935]  It wasn't because the Obama administration was informing them.
[01:45:34.955 --> 01:45:37.357]  They knew that they were lying about that, and they lied to them.
[01:45:37.377 --> 01:45:47.886]  But he says that we are prosecuting terrorists, consistent with our laws and system of checks and balances, and we're even more transparent to the American people and to the world.
[01:45:48.406 --> 01:45:52.909]  Well, they became very transparent to the American people and the world just a few months after that.
[01:45:52.949 --> 01:45:58.211]  They became transparent that they were lying scumbags, breaking the law, spying on everyone.
[01:45:58.752 --> 01:45:59.612]  It's amazing.
[01:45:59.692 --> 01:46:06.116]  And then he goes on to talk about how they needed to protect us from hackers who were going to steal people's identity.
[01:46:06.736 --> 01:46:07.097]  I think so.
[01:46:26.796 --> 01:46:27.477]  I don't know.
[01:46:41.687 --> 01:46:42.387]  No, he can't talk about that.
[01:46:42.407 --> 01:46:42.868]  So we knew that.
[01:46:43.248 --> 01:46:52.354]  And yet they're going to justify this stuff based on the fact that we're all threatened from some boogeyman outside when we all learned that the boogeyman is inside.
[01:46:52.654 --> 01:46:55.276]  It became a very widely known thing.
[01:46:55.316 --> 01:46:55.696]  Exactly.
[01:46:55.716 --> 01:46:58.057]  Now, David, it seems like the speech is over now.
[01:46:58.118 --> 01:46:59.919]  I believe Obama is moving through the crowd.
[01:46:59.939 --> 01:47:02.080]  Maybe we can pull that back up and see.
[01:47:02.140 --> 01:47:04.642]  There he is, you know, doing his rock star thing again.
[01:47:05.342 --> 01:47:10.304]  Walking through the crowd, shaking hands, you know, no babies to kiss, but I'm sure if there were some, he'd be kissing them.
[01:47:10.964 --> 01:47:12.705]  So, you know, what do you guys think about this?
[01:47:12.725 --> 01:47:28.572]  You know, now that this is over and, you know, the parts we are able to hear over our commentary, just, you know, Leanne, you called it talking about the drones and the warfare, other things, you know, such as Obamacare, other aspects that he mentioned or failed to mention.
[01:47:28.652 --> 01:47:31.293]  Was there anything that you guys thought he was going to talk about that he didn't?
[01:47:32.199 --> 01:47:34.360]  I kind of thought he was going to talk about the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:35.560]  He talked about it last year.
[01:47:35.660 --> 01:47:39.201]  Maybe he didn't want to bring it up because he failed to execute on it for his master's.
[01:47:39.541 --> 01:47:43.222]  They were going to push that through secretly on everybody at the end of the year.
[01:47:43.262 --> 01:47:49.184]  They had pushed through this fast-tracked authorization that they're working on to try to get it through.
[01:47:49.304 --> 01:47:52.085]  So they've been negotiating this, of course, for people who don't know.
[01:47:52.345 --> 01:48:00.808]  The Trans-Pacific Partnership is being negotiated by over 600 corporate lobbyists, and elected representatives are not allowed to see what is in it.
[01:48:01.562 --> 01:48:04.765]  Of any country, not just our country, but any country, you're not allowed to see what's in it.
[01:48:05.105 --> 01:48:06.526]  But we have had leaks from it.
[01:48:06.607 --> 01:48:17.896]  We do know that it's not simply a trade agreement that's going to eviscerate our economy, eviscerate our workers, like the previous trade agreements have, but it's also going to do things like enact CISPA.
[01:48:18.257 --> 01:48:24.702]  It's going to do things in terms of intellectual property, a lot of things that are not typically done in a trade agreement.
[01:48:24.803 --> 01:48:26.504]  It's going to make
[01:48:27.705 --> 01:48:27.805]  Yes.
[01:48:46.508 --> 01:48:46.808]  Thank you.
[01:49:07.745 --> 01:49:08.846]  It's not going to do that at all.
[01:49:08.906 --> 01:49:10.487]  It's going to do exactly the opposite.
[01:49:10.527 --> 01:49:11.828]  We know exactly what's going to happen.
[01:49:12.169 --> 01:49:15.251]  We were told that it was going to be this giant sucking sound when NAFTA came in.
[01:49:15.531 --> 01:49:17.032]  And it was a giant sucking sound.
[01:49:17.052 --> 01:49:19.494]  And we've been sucking jobs out of the economy ever since.
[01:49:19.534 --> 01:49:22.997]  And this is going to speed that process up, put it on steroids.
[01:49:23.057 --> 01:49:23.998]  And he didn't talk about that.
[01:49:24.218 --> 01:49:25.659]  Yeah, well, that's what he was saying last year.
[01:49:25.699 --> 01:49:28.861]  He'd hoped that that would be the thing that he could complete by the end of the year.
[01:49:29.001 --> 01:49:34.084]  And there, once again, there was no congressional oversight, yet they're still clapping, going, that sounds like a great idea.
[01:49:34.484 --> 01:49:37.046]  We should fast track that and make that happen.
[01:49:37.586 --> 01:49:41.009]  And maybe he didn't bring it up this year as well, because people...
[01:49:41.969 --> 01:49:48.591]  The public is now finally catching on to this TPP, and you see these big movements of stop the TPP, wait a minute, this is a bad thing.
[01:49:48.992 --> 01:49:55.614]  So maybe he kind of reeled that back because it's now in the public's consciousness, what is this thing, and wait, he's going to fast track it?
[01:49:55.934 --> 01:49:58.355]  A year ago, very few people were talking about it, anywhere.
[01:49:59.465 --> 01:50:07.591]  But now there is some awareness of it, and so what he does is, with executive order to show that he's going to act unilaterally today, he comes up and says, I'm going to raise the minimum wage.
[01:50:07.651 --> 01:50:15.336]  But when you look at the fine print, he's still lying to his base, his base that thinks that they're going to be better off when they're not by having the minimum wage raised.
[01:50:15.456 --> 01:50:20.139]  All he's going to do is raise the minimum wage for federal contractors, and not even that.
[01:50:20.399 --> 01:50:22.801]  It's going to be for new federal contracts.
[01:50:23.061 --> 01:50:23.741]  And not even that.
[01:50:24.141 --> 01:50:26.262]  It's going to have to be a major new rewrite.
[01:50:26.322 --> 01:50:29.683]  And if they just renew somebody's contract, that still isn't going to qualify.
[01:50:29.723 --> 01:50:31.884]  They're still not going to have to raise the minimum wage.
[01:50:31.924 --> 01:50:35.485]  So it's lie on top of lie, spin on top of spin.
[01:50:35.765 --> 01:50:38.465]  He's lying to his own base, just like he's lying to everybody else.
[01:50:38.525 --> 01:50:39.926]  Yeah, you know, and we talk about
[01:50:40.925 --> 01:50:46.706]  Raising the wages, the minimum wage, and you know, I've been out to these fast food rallies and the Fight for $15, everybody wants $15.
[01:50:46.806 --> 01:50:57.748]  I don't have a problem with these guys making more money, but one of the questions I asked the guy, I said, you know, do you think your time would be better served if you went out here and protested the Federal Reserve and tried to stop the dollar devaluation?
[01:50:57.768 --> 01:51:07.350]  Because as we talked about, you were talking about that film back in the 50s, you know, if you're making $30,000 a year, you could be, you know, the head of the household making all the money.
[01:51:07.410 --> 01:51:09.411]  Mom stays at home with the kids and everything was fine.
[01:51:09.831 --> 01:51:10.311]  But, you know,
[01:51:10.751 --> 01:51:16.093]  Well, when they talk about how they're... When $15 an hour is the new $7 an hour, then everybody's going to be out there doing the same thing again.
[01:51:16.213 --> 01:51:16.854]  That's right.
[01:51:17.074 --> 01:51:20.695]  Ask the question, why don't I have the purchasing power that I did a few years ago?
[01:51:20.715 --> 01:51:22.156]  They're not asking why that's happening.
[01:51:22.416 --> 01:51:24.417]  And so it's going to happen all over again.
[01:51:24.457 --> 01:51:31.740]  We've seen this happen for the last 100 years and nobody says, let's get off of this merry-go-round and let's take a look at what the real root cause is.
[01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:33.581]  Because they just want to put a band-aid on it.
[01:51:33.701 --> 01:51:34.721]  They just want to make them happy.
[01:51:35.121 --> 01:51:42.443]  It's kind of like when my sons were young and we go to the store and I hand them a $10 bill and we get back some bubblegum and a bunch of ones.
[01:51:42.483 --> 01:51:43.444]  They think we got more money.
[01:51:43.744 --> 01:51:48.365]  Well, if they do that with a minimum wage, these people think that they've got more money and it's not going to work out that way.
[01:51:48.505 --> 01:51:54.667]  Even if they index it to inflation, when we still have inflation, it's going to just create a spiral.
[01:51:54.967 --> 01:51:57.508]  And it's going to be a death spiral of inflation for the economy.
[01:51:57.910 --> 01:51:58.291]  Exactly.
[01:51:58.471 --> 01:52:07.041]  When I was watching that speech, the thing that hit me most was his talk about education and the kids in school and the student loans and the debt and all that.
[01:52:07.321 --> 01:52:16.973]  As I was talking about during the commentary, I guess I'm the most recent guy out of us to be in school and I've got friends who are still in school or recently got out of school and they have these just
[01:52:17.293 --> 01:52:18.634]  Well that's always the case.
[01:52:42.688 --> 01:52:44.229]  That's always been the case with a college degree.
[01:52:44.249 --> 01:52:51.353]  It was that way when I was in college, except that we didn't have the kind of tuition costs that is orders of magnitude higher than it used to be.
[01:52:51.773 --> 01:52:58.417]  But no problem, they'll give you a loan with an easy payment plan so that you can be in debt to the bankers for your entire life.
[01:52:58.517 --> 01:52:59.278]  That's what they want to do.
[01:52:59.318 --> 01:53:05.781]  They want to get you out of, once you get into the workforce, they want you to enter the workforce as a wage slave to the bankers.
[01:53:05.901 --> 01:53:06.842]  That's what this is all about.
[01:53:07.142 --> 01:53:07.482]  Exactly.
[01:53:07.502 --> 01:53:09.284]  It's about them owning everything.
[01:53:09.344 --> 01:53:11.285]  That's what the Trans-Pacific Partnership is about.
[01:53:11.586 --> 01:53:17.330]  It's about them asserting ownership over everything, over intellectual property, to use it to censor the Internet.
[01:53:17.731 --> 01:53:23.595]  That's what the Trans-Pacific Partnership is, and that's, I think, why people are starting to wake up to it, why he didn't talk about that today.
[01:53:23.655 --> 01:53:25.557]  Anything else that you wanted to bring up?
[01:53:25.657 --> 01:53:40.914]  Well, you know, I'm a big Second Amendment advocate, and I see this guy come up there, and he talks about the families, maybe the Sandy Hook families or whoever else, who lost their children in these unfortunate incidents, and they very much are unfortunate, but to say that
[01:53:41.434 --> 01:53:44.775]  When he comes out on stage, he said, I'm not going to take your rifle away, I'm not going to take your shotgun away.
[01:53:45.055 --> 01:53:46.756]  Meanwhile, he's talking about these bitter clingers.
[01:53:46.796 --> 01:53:48.957]  If you have a gun in your Bible, you're a bitter clinger.
[01:53:49.097 --> 01:53:55.359]  But in the debates with Romney, this is why it was so boggling to me, you know, when he says that he's not going to take your guns away.
[01:53:55.419 --> 01:54:02.182]  But in the debates with Romney, he's talking about taking away AK-47s, he's talking about taking away cheap handguns in the city of Chicago.
[01:54:02.482 --> 01:54:04.162]  Meanwhile, he says, I'm not trying to take your guns away.
[01:54:04.222 --> 01:54:05.383]  But the deal about that was,
[01:54:05.803 --> 01:54:15.706]  A lot of the Democrats say, well, Obama's not trying to take your gun away, because he was content to sit back and let Dianne Feinstein do whatever she wanted, and whatever she was going to get passed, he was going to be okay with it.
[01:54:15.726 --> 01:54:22.887]  And that's proof positive, because when that legislation failed, he was on TV with Gabby Giffords and Biden and whoever else was there, you know, all due respect to Ms.
[01:54:22.907 --> 01:54:24.808]  Giffords, but he goes up there and he says, well,
[01:54:25.528 --> 01:54:28.031]  Our country, they failed us today.
[01:54:28.051 --> 01:54:31.254]  We didn't get this common sense reform that 98% of Americans wanted.
[01:54:31.634 --> 01:54:32.455]  I'm like, who are you asking?
[01:54:32.515 --> 01:54:39.122]  He asked 10 people who work in the White House, and that's his 90% of Americans who want stricter gun laws.
[01:54:39.442 --> 01:54:43.486]  Well, Americans are voting in the marketplace by buying guns and ammunition as quickly as they could.
[01:54:43.866 --> 01:54:48.749]  And the thing that makes Obama more dangerous than these other politicians is that he's smarter about what he's doing.
[01:54:49.009 --> 01:54:56.332]  He's doing stealth control by controlling ammunition and controlling the supply and doing things like that under the radar.
[01:54:56.392 --> 01:54:57.793]  Little tiny pieces like that.
[01:54:57.813 --> 01:54:59.214]  That's what makes him so dangerous.
[01:54:59.454 --> 01:55:05.378]  But we have guys, you know, we got the constitutional sheriff's guys like Sheriff Mack, the sheriffs that stood up in Colorado.
[01:55:05.398 --> 01:55:08.560]  So people are pushing back against this and I'm very happy to see it.
[01:55:08.580 --> 01:55:09.461]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:55:09.561 --> 01:55:16.686]  Well, last year when he opened up his State of the Union, he invoked the Constitution saying that it should be something to bring them all together.
[01:55:16.966 --> 01:55:18.407]  And this year it didn't go there at all.
[01:55:18.427 --> 01:55:20.789]  It was more like, I'm going to do this with or without you.
[01:55:21.230 --> 01:55:28.596]  Seems the president should be trying to bring the country together and doing things that both the House and the Senate, everyone can agree on.
[01:55:29.117 --> 01:55:32.880]  But then we hear, you know, Jones says anything you hear bipartisan, run away, run away.
[01:55:32.940 --> 01:55:33.681]  It's like a cancer.
[01:55:34.401 --> 01:55:39.702]  Well, it's going to be interesting to see what he does this year, but I don't think the State of the Union is really going to have anything much to do with it.
[01:55:39.862 --> 01:55:40.603]  It never does.
[01:55:40.743 --> 01:55:42.083]  It's always a pack of lies.
[01:55:42.603 --> 01:55:45.444]  It's really more interesting to look at what he said in years past.
[01:55:45.884 --> 01:55:48.205]  He's talking about Chrysler growing faster than any other U.S.
[01:55:48.245 --> 01:55:48.985]  major car company.
[01:55:49.025 --> 01:55:52.526]  That was in 2012, and of course, Chrysler is no longer a U.S.
[01:55:52.686 --> 01:55:53.266]  car company.
[01:55:53.326 --> 01:55:53.566]  Correct.
[01:55:53.706 --> 01:55:56.127]  Made possible by Obama and by Bush.
[01:55:56.247 --> 01:55:58.687]  And they finished that up this last year, so they're gone.
[01:55:59.227 --> 01:56:00.268]  And GM is on its way.
[01:56:01.508 --> 01:56:04.350]  And I'm just wondering when people will get tired of hearing these lies.
[01:56:04.390 --> 01:56:05.490]  People who are paying attention.
[01:56:05.730 --> 01:56:09.472]  If you're the most diehard Obama supporter, you must have realized these lies now.
[01:56:09.832 --> 01:56:12.954]  Or even if you don't want to say that they're lies, they're things that he couldn't follow through on.
[01:56:13.254 --> 01:56:15.035]  You know, he couldn't shut down Guantanamo.
[01:56:15.075 --> 01:56:17.116]  He couldn't not raise your taxes.
[01:56:17.136 --> 01:56:18.497]  He couldn't do a lot of things.
[01:56:18.939 --> 01:56:26.288]  You know, so at very least, you know, I hope people are waking up to this, that even if they think his intentions are good, he can't follow through on what he says he's going to do.
[01:56:26.528 --> 01:56:28.650]  And that doesn't mean we just necessarily get rid of Obama.
[01:56:28.670 --> 01:56:29.792]  I'm not saying that's a bad idea.
[01:56:30.072 --> 01:56:33.977]  But you have to get rid of the system that allows this guy to play ball in such a fashion.
[01:56:34.017 --> 01:56:34.838]  The same thing with Bush.
[01:56:35.058 --> 01:56:36.059]  The same thing with Clinton.
[01:56:36.460 --> 01:56:39.183]  And, you know, just make sure that it doesn't happen going into the new elections.
[01:56:39.403 --> 01:56:44.627]  But I think the key way to reform the system, one of the things that you have to do, is not allow them to get away with it.
[01:56:44.947 --> 01:56:52.012]  And that's what is so very dangerous, is that the Republicans are allowing them to get away with one criminal scandal after the other.
[01:56:52.052 --> 01:56:54.654]  Whether it's Fast and Furious, Benghazi, you name it.
[01:56:54.734 --> 01:56:58.436]  It's gone on and on and on, using the IRS and the FBI after their political enemies.
[01:56:58.696 --> 01:57:07.883]  We see that, it goes unpunished, it only gets worse, and that's what's really dangerous about this whole situation that we're in right now, is that we don't have a party in opposition.
[01:57:08.308 --> 01:57:16.473]  Right, and we see them coming after people that are in the media or, you know, filmmakers and people that are exercising their First Amendment.
[01:57:16.513 --> 01:57:23.578]  We see the Democrats coming after the politician who was selling some, you know, products on the side.
[01:57:23.638 --> 01:57:33.865]  Like, they are going after very minimal things and the Republicans are the ones that need to be going after Obama for the things that he's doing, breaking the law.
[01:57:35.316 --> 01:57:35.696]  You're right.
[01:57:35.836 --> 01:57:43.220]  Well you know they don't do this because they want all these same powers when they get back in the office and that's why you have to break out of this left-right paradigm.
[01:57:43.441 --> 01:57:44.841]  You say they're both doing the same things.
[01:57:44.861 --> 01:57:45.742]  I don't want either of them.
[01:57:45.842 --> 01:57:46.222]  That's right.
[01:57:46.522 --> 01:57:50.965]  And there's very few people who will take the opposition when their guy gets in power.
[01:57:51.505 --> 01:57:52.686]  We see that now with the left.
[01:57:52.726 --> 01:57:53.666]  We've seen it with the right.
[01:57:54.267 --> 01:58:03.051]  And hopefully, a lot of these people who are criticizing these things that Obama is doing right now, who are on the right, hopefully they'll criticize those same things when their guy gets in power.
[01:58:03.111 --> 01:58:06.053]  Because the same, as you point out, the same bureaucracy is going to be in power.
[01:58:06.753 --> 01:58:11.496]  Well, I think we're done for tonight, and we're going to be back tomorrow at 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[01:58:11.716 --> 01:58:12.156]  Eastern.
[01:58:12.276 --> 01:58:22.501]  Thanks for joining us, Jakari Jackson and Leanne McAdoo, and we've just seen Obama's State of the Union, or I guess we should call it the State of the Unilateral Assertions.
[01:58:23.081 --> 01:58:26.803]  So we're going to see exactly what he does as he rolls out Dictator 2.0.
