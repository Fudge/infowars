[00:00:01.127 --> 00:00:10.309]  Well, former NSA employee turned whistleblower Edward Snowden says he has a holy sh** smoking gun revelation coming.
[00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:15.490]  Now, I'm quoting Snowden from an upcoming issue of Wired Magazine.
[00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.531]  Here is the cover photo where he is wrapped up in the American flag.
[00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:29.953]  Now, in the interview with Wired, Snowden says he doesn't have anywhere near the 1.7 million documents the government claims he does,
[00:00:30.393 --> 00:00:36.340]  But he still has a significant amount of information that is yet to be made public.
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.281]  That's right.
[00:00:37.361 --> 00:00:42.687]  Now he has volumes of documents that he hasn't even had a chance to read yet.
[00:00:43.067 --> 00:00:45.490]  And that, my friends, that makes the U.S.
[00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.512]  government very, very nervous.
[00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:49.435]  Because they don't know what he's got.
[00:00:49.895 --> 00:01:04.689]  And they're afraid that somewhere in the piles of documents there is incriminating evidence that would severely damage them all politically, and who knows, perhaps even shatter the whole false left versus right paradigm.
[00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:05.710]  One could only hope.
[00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:15.052]  Now, Snowden says in the Wired Magazine interview, I think they think there is a smoking gun in there that would be the death of them all politically.
[00:01:15.452 --> 00:01:24.494]  He goes on to say that somewhere in their damage assessment, they must have seen something that was like, holy s**t, and they think it's still out there.
[00:01:25.114 --> 00:01:27.555]  What do you think the new Snowden info could be, Ray?
[00:01:29.244 --> 00:01:31.427]  Well, Alex, good to be back with you.
[00:01:31.687 --> 00:01:32.748]  That is a curveball.
[00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:35.731]  Could you give me a minute to get my catcher's mitt?
[00:01:38.855 --> 00:01:47.084]  You know, I'd only be speculating, but I imagine, given what Glenn Greenwald has kinched it at in the past,
[00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:59.448]  That there are names and there are numbers and there are incredibly heinous snooping activities going on against very important people.
[00:02:01.313 --> 00:02:05.996]  I'll let you guess who they are, but they couldn't be more important in our country.
[00:02:06.957 --> 00:02:14.182]  And once that's revealed, one would expect that substance you mentioned to hit the fan.
[00:02:15.042 --> 00:02:28.412]  But you know, the way things are working, Alex, with the executive and the Congress and parts of our judicial system all kind of complicit in these crimes against our Constitution,
[00:02:29.485 --> 00:02:34.407]  You know I'd have to say I'd have to be from Missouri as to whether anything would be done about this.
[00:02:35.027 --> 00:02:41.610]  Now that was from earlier today on the Alex Jones Show in an interview with former top CIA analyst Ray McGovern.
[00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:52.215]  Now I think it was very interesting that in this interview with Snowden in the Wired Magazine issue that's coming up next month that they also interviewed James Bamford.
[00:02:52.535 --> 00:02:57.257]  Now he's the guy who blew the whistle on the Northwoods documents.
[00:02:57.797 --> 00:03:03.502]  Perhaps the the most documented false flag terror operation of all time.
[00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:05.604]  Operation Northwoods.
[00:03:06.045 --> 00:03:18.877]  And James Bamford, who is a US Navy intelligence analyst who became a best-selling author and journalist, well he was able to get his hands on the Northwoods document through the Freedom of Information Act for his book
[00:03:19.377 --> 00:03:19.897]  I think so.
[00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:49.812]  Luckily, by the time it reached JFK's desk, he rejected it, and rumors have it that JFK fired General Limitzer as a result of the madness.
[00:03:50.432 --> 00:03:53.953]  Now, here's what's in the Northwoods document.
[00:03:54.433 --> 00:04:01.655]  It called for violent terrorism to be launched on the streets of Washington, D.C., Miami, and elsewhere across America.
[00:04:02.135 --> 00:04:05.336]  It called for innocent people to be shot on American streets.
[00:04:05.916 --> 00:04:10.501]  Snipers to shoot and kill our own troops stationed at Gitmo.
[00:04:11.142 --> 00:04:16.007]  They wanted to sink a boatload of Cuban refugees escaping Cuba to Florida.
[00:04:16.368 --> 00:04:19.611]  People would be framed for bombings that they did not commit.
[00:04:20.252 --> 00:04:22.815]  And you know, a lot of this sounds eerily familiar to 9-11.
[00:04:25.157 --> 00:04:29.018]  Operation Northwoods called for commercial airliners to be hijacked.
[00:04:29.398 --> 00:04:39.141]  They wanted to crash a passenger airliner into the ocean, preferably full of high school and college students, because that would have, you know, really upset the American public.
[00:04:39.481 --> 00:04:50.424]  So these people were obviously maniacal, they were crazy, and it was approved, and undoubtedly would have got the green light if JFK had not rejected it.
[00:04:51.084 --> 00:04:55.026]  It is a dramatic example of what our government is capable of doing.
[00:04:55.706 --> 00:05:04.031]  And for those of you who call this a crazy conspiracy theory, I can already see the comments on YouTube, wake up and smell the tyranny.
[00:05:04.591 --> 00:05:09.614]  The Operation Northwoods, it's a living, breathing, live document.
[00:05:09.694 --> 00:05:12.015]  It exists in the National Archives.
[00:05:12.095 --> 00:05:14.476]  It was obtained by the Freedom of Information Act.
[00:05:14.796 --> 00:05:19.299]  It was signed off by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Pentagon.
[00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:20.579]  So it is real.
[00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:32.944]  And I'm wondering if somewhere in the volumes of documents that are in right now in the possession of Edward Snowden, perhaps there is more evidence, more proof of false flag terrorism.
