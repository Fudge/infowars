[00:00:11.052 --> 00:00:14.796]  Hey guys, Rob Dew here from InfoWars Nightly News and I want to talk about solutions.
[00:00:15.296 --> 00:00:21.483]  One of the things we talk about a lot on InfoWars.com and in the documentaries and videos that we make here is that you are the solution.
[00:00:21.543 --> 00:00:22.964]  You have to be part of the solution.
[00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:26.208]  If you wait for others to do it, you're going to be waiting a long time.
[00:00:26.248 --> 00:00:30.152]  You need to stand up and become active and get involved in the game.
[00:00:30.712 --> 00:00:39.642]  One way to do that is by saying no, opting out, like with the TSA, or spending your dollars locally instead of at a big box chain.
[00:00:39.662 --> 00:00:41.164]  These are all ways that you can get involved.
[00:00:41.664 --> 00:00:45.308]  Well, now we have Obamacare, and this is a big medical tyranny thing.
[00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:49.233]  Here's just a little bit of what Alex Jones has to say about Obamacare earlier this year.
[00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.311]  Basically, it was a blank check to do whatever they want.
[00:00:52.631 --> 00:01:18.221]  Share all your data, NSA the medical records, federalize it, give it to all these corporate interests, kick people off their existing plans, kick people off that had pre-existing conditions, not cover children, lower the quality of care, double, triple, quadruple prices, shut down small health care divisions and providers, small insurance companies and HMOs, small clinic chains that help the poor.
[00:01:21.052 --> 00:01:23.573]  I come from a family of physicians and healthcare management.
[00:01:23.593 --> 00:01:24.634]  I mean, I know about this stuff.
[00:01:25.074 --> 00:01:26.235]  And I had doctors on.
[00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:27.836]  I had researchers on.
[00:01:28.096 --> 00:01:30.017]  The insurance companies bragged that they wrote it.
[00:01:30.297 --> 00:01:31.598]  They lobbied to get it passed.
[00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.000]  The Republican leadership helped write it.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.982]  And I said, this is a bipartisan screwjob and it's really going to hurt people.
[00:01:38.362 --> 00:01:45.106]  So most of you watching this are going to agree that Obamacare is not a good thing, it was written by the insurance companies, and you know all the rest.
[00:01:45.886 --> 00:01:52.750]  But what I want to talk about are ways to get around Obamacare, especially the fees, because starting in 2015, the fees are going to get bigger.
[00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.151]  In fact, here's what it says on healthcare.gov.
[00:01:55.671 --> 00:02:03.576]  If you don't have coverage in 2015, you'll pay the higher of these two amounts, 2% of your yearly household income, or $325 per person for the year,
[00:02:06.297 --> 00:02:08.818]  The maximum penalty per family using this method is $975.
[00:02:09.698 --> 00:02:14.400]  So if you have a family of four, you're going to be paying close to $1,000 in fines for 2015.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.721]  And it's only going to go up.
[00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:18.762]  You've seen the articles on InfoWars.
[00:02:18.982 --> 00:02:25.665]  We've read emails out from people of others out there who've seen their rates rise or have their plans cut.
[00:02:26.645 --> 00:02:27.905]  They've seen prices double.
[00:02:27.945 --> 00:02:32.467]  Some people are paying more for their health insurance than their mortgage on their house.
[00:02:32.787 --> 00:02:33.968]  But you remember what Obama said.
[00:02:34.608 --> 00:02:39.489]  If you've got health care already, then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it.
[00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.470]  If you like the plan you have, you can keep it.
[00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.250]  I intend to keep this promise.
[00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.951]  If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan.
[00:02:46.971 --> 00:02:49.792]  If you like your plan and your doctor, you can keep them.
[00:02:49.892 --> 00:02:51.552]  You'll be able to keep your health care plan.
[00:02:51.832 --> 00:02:54.393]  If you like your plan, you keep your plan.
[00:02:54.413 --> 00:02:58.594]  If you like your doctor, you like your plan, you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan.
[00:02:58.614 --> 00:03:01.715]  If you like your current insurance, you keep that insurance.
[00:03:02.495 --> 00:03:03.015]  Period.
[00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:04.015]  So what do you do?
[00:03:04.376 --> 00:03:04.956]  Where do you go?
[00:03:05.496 --> 00:03:12.618]  Is there an alternative to this skyrocketing insurance where it's got super high premiums and deductibles that have been calculated never to be reached?
[00:03:13.218 --> 00:03:18.880]  But before we get to these solutions, let's just look at one instance here of insurance companies and their disreputable dealings.
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.621]  Here's what advocate Dr. Margaret Flowers had to say about the health insurance system in New York State.
[00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:30.563]  I think, looking at our Blue Cross program here, and what they found was that about one out of every five claims was denied just randomly.
[00:03:30.963 --> 00:03:34.364]  Like if five claims come in, they just pull one out and say they're not going to pay this one.
[00:03:34.625 --> 00:03:45.748]  And we have evidence of this in New York from people that worked in these claim offices, that if there was a certain level area of the city, lower income area, they would deny those claims because they knew people didn't have the resources to fight back.
[00:03:46.548 --> 00:03:50.329]  All the more reason to get out of a system that wasn't even designed to help you in the first place.
[00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.570]  A little over a year ago, me and my wife had the same problem.
[00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:02.112]  I saw insurance as a scam, I was sick and tired of paying the high premiums and the deductibles that you can never reach, and then we heard from a neighbor about a program called Samaritan Ministries.
[00:04:02.552 --> 00:04:07.013]  It was started back in 1994 by Ted Penninger from his home in Washington, Illinois.
[00:04:07.293 --> 00:04:14.815]  The group has since grown to 36,000 member households participating, and they have around $9 million available each month to meet health care needs.
[00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:17.596]  They don't consider themselves health insurance.
[00:04:17.836 --> 00:04:19.676]  What they call it is health sharing.
[00:04:19.836 --> 00:04:20.657]  And here's how it works.
[00:04:21.197 --> 00:04:30.460]  Health sharing is a biblical approach to paying for health care based on passages such as Galatians 6 verse 2, which says, So each member commits to sending a set share amount each month.
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.301]  These shares are sent directly through the mail from one household to another member with needs.
[00:04:42.003 --> 00:04:49.281]  Samaritan Ministries uses a database that randomly matches shares to needs so that sharing is coordinated and that shares go to the appropriate members with the needs.
[00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:55.840]  Our share by the way is just a little over four hundred dollars and that covers a family of five and that's what we pay per month.
[00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:02.301]  One section which I like on their website is called accountability which is a word you do not see on many major health insurance sites.
[00:05:03.021 --> 00:05:11.503]  So I'm taking money out of this bloated giant bureaucracy that we call health care and the insurance system and sending my money directly to people to help them with their medical needs.
[00:05:11.643 --> 00:05:15.884]  It's a great way to participate in your community and just help one another plus
[00:05:16.624 --> 00:05:18.865]  When you need to use the services, they're there for you.
[00:05:19.505 --> 00:05:23.047]  And by participating in this, I get to bypass those Obamacare fines.
[00:05:23.407 --> 00:05:30.570]  That's right, Samaritan Ministries and a few others I'm going to mention are grandfathered in so they're not beholden to the laws of Obamacare.
[00:05:31.291 --> 00:05:38.374]  Now they do have a questionnaire and a few forms they want you to fill out and they want you to attend church and you have to have your application and any claims signed by a pastor.
[00:05:38.914 --> 00:05:41.535]  So if you don't attend church, you might want to find one in your area.
[00:05:41.875 --> 00:05:45.537]  And also, you need to take a long look at SamaritanMinistries.org.
[00:05:45.557 --> 00:05:49.939]  It's got all the questions, everything you can answer that I couldn't possibly get to in this report.
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.422]  Earlier this year, we had an unfortunate incident and it cost us over $600 in medical bills.
[00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:58.863]  After filling out the forms and sending everything in, we got over $500 back.
[00:06:00.504 --> 00:06:07.773]  This was our first experience using Samaritan Ministries, but let me tell you, I feel good about using it and I think you should check it out and really give it a try.
[00:06:07.793 --> 00:06:10.036]  It's a great way to get out of this Obamacare system.
[00:06:11.465 --> 00:06:17.507]  So this is one way you can get out of the system, stop feeding it, take away its fuel, thereby taking away its power.
[00:06:17.667 --> 00:06:19.207]  It's a great way to do it.
[00:06:19.247 --> 00:06:20.668]  Now I'm going to describe a few more here.
[00:06:21.108 --> 00:06:25.349]  The article, Opting Out of Obamacare Through Medical Sharing Ministries, focuses on MediShare.
[00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.771]  Founded in 1993, MediShare historically grew at roughly 10% a year.
[00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:36.393]  Since Obamacare passed in 2010, the growth has ticked up to about 15%, as some Americans look to end-run the mandate.
[00:06:36.573 --> 00:06:44.299]  About 150,000 people are members of medical sharing ministries and 60,000 of them belong to MediShare, according to MediShare President CEO Tony Meggs.
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:50.564]  The Obamacare fee exemption requires health sharing ministries to have been in operation before December 31st, 1999.
[00:06:51.905 --> 00:06:59.251]  So if you're looking at one that's been around since the 2000s, you may want to take a quick look because they're probably not going to be able to opt out of this Obamacare fee system.
[00:07:00.472 --> 00:07:02.974]  So we've looked at Samaritan Ministries and MediShare.
[00:07:03.254 --> 00:07:06.396]  The final one here is called LibertyHealthShare.org.
[00:07:06.877 --> 00:07:10.199]  They call their system a tried and true cost sharing method that works.
[00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:15.062]  Liberty HealthShare is a reorganization of an existing group that has been sharing costs since 1988.
[00:07:15.222 --> 00:07:18.705]  They have been operating successfully for decades because it works.
[00:07:19.145 --> 00:07:22.608]  During that period, over $20 million has been shared to meet each other's costs.
[00:07:23.048 --> 00:07:28.132]  Medical cost sharing is currently being used by thousands of families nationwide meeting their health care costs each month.
[00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:30.349]  And you can look on their website.
[00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:33.991]  They have sections like person-to-person sharing, how the funds are used.
[00:07:34.591 --> 00:07:36.792]  They also talk about accountability, which I think is great.
[00:07:37.052 --> 00:07:42.394]  And they have three different option levels you can get into, so I suggest you check those out and see if they meet your needs.
[00:07:43.971 --> 00:07:57.684]  And finally, there's a group out there called GreenInsurance.com, which sets itself up as a co-op, and they have a couple membership levels, and they offer to provide up to 100% alternative medicine coverage for services like acupuncture, cleansing, detoxing, even massage.
[00:07:58.024 --> 00:08:04.310]  But this site looks brand new, so I don't think it's going to qualify for that Obamacare exemption, but you may want to call them and find out, or send them an email.
[00:08:05.475 --> 00:08:06.995]  So there are alternatives out there.
[00:08:07.315 --> 00:08:08.936]  I'm using one of them, and it works for me.
[00:08:08.956 --> 00:08:13.457]  It lets me opt out of Obamacare, and let me tell you, that is one way to defeat the system.
[00:08:14.057 --> 00:08:14.737]  Thanks for watching.
[00:08:14.998 --> 00:08:21.119]  Be sure to subscribe to this channel and share this video to everybody you know, especially if they're looking for a way to get out of Obamacare.
[00:08:21.499 --> 00:08:27.121]  And in the comments section, I'd like you to write if you're using a health-sharing service, which one you're using, and if it works for you.
[00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:31.602]  And if you're a government-paid troll, please tell us how that government-paid health insurance is working out for you.
