[00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:06.431]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com in Spokane, Washington, standing outside of the Superior Courthouse.
[00:00:06.731 --> 00:00:08.792]  Now I'm here with Representative Matt Shea.
[00:00:09.112 --> 00:00:10.613]  You have some new information for us.
[00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:14.994]  Absolutely, going to be introducing the bill, the repeal I-594 here in Washington State.
[00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.935]  We'll be introducing that here in the next two weeks.
[00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:21.317]  And based on the turnout today, a lot of people are supportive of that idea.
[00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:26.004]  Yeah, it's good to see a lot of American citizens coming out and supporting the Second Amendment.
[00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:27.307]  They say, hey, you know what?
[00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:28.749]  You're not going to infringe on our rights.
[00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.736]  You're not going to bully us around and tell us what we can and cannot do.
[00:00:33.473 --> 00:00:33.953]  Absolutely.
[00:00:34.013 --> 00:00:43.458]  And the point is, you can't have rights that are given to you by God voted away by 51% to take away the 49%'s rights that are unalienable.
[00:00:43.778 --> 00:00:45.099]  And I think that's the whole point behind this.
[00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:53.603]  I think it's also the point behind many people in the rally today understanding that Article 1, Section 24 of the state constitution says, our right to bear arms shall not be impaired.
[00:00:53.623 --> 00:00:55.444]  And that's exactly what this initiative does.
[00:00:55.464 --> 00:00:58.226]  All 18 very confusing, vague pages of it.
[00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:04.569]  Now, what's something you want to tell the rest of America right now, who's watching, who might have something like this come to their state?
[00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.190]  What's a message you could give to them?
[00:01:07.091 --> 00:01:08.252]  Freedom is non-negotiable.
[00:01:08.592 --> 00:01:13.715]  We have to stand for freedom now, not just for us, but for our kids, our grandkids, and our great-grandkids.
[00:01:14.095 --> 00:01:20.659]  And in addition to that, freedom not being negotiable, if we don't stand for it now, we might not have the ability to stand for freedom later.
[00:01:21.701 --> 00:01:22.701]  Yes, that's very true.
[00:01:22.941 --> 00:01:23.942]  Now take a look at this real quick.
[00:01:23.962 --> 00:01:26.983]  Look at all the people who came out here today in support of this.
[00:01:27.503 --> 00:01:28.283]  This is amazing.
[00:01:28.604 --> 00:01:32.125]  Everybody out here came out here in support of what's going on.
[00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:33.826]  We need more Americans to do this.
[00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:38.747]  We need more cities, towns, to stand up and say, you know what, enough is enough.
[00:01:38.787 --> 00:01:40.308]  You're not going to infringe on our rights.
[00:01:40.728 --> 00:01:42.809]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
