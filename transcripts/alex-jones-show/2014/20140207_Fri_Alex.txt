[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:00.329]  Tom.
[00:00:01.411 --> 00:00:02.592]  Coast to Coast.
[00:00:02.953 --> 00:00:04.314]  Direct from Austin.
[00:00:05.015 --> 00:00:08.219]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:14.758 --> 00:00:18.940]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.401]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:22.082]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:26.344]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.904 --> 00:00:30.966]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:49.622 --> 00:00:57.587]  Man, I tell you, I have marveled at Ted Cruz and how he's been hardcore, telling it like it is when faced with real tyranny.
[00:00:58.468 --> 00:01:11.236]  And I've been pointing out that Ted Cruz will become the leader of the Republican Party if the neocons aren't able to block him, if he continues with the hardcore rhetoric, which is based on what's actually happening.
[00:01:12.036 --> 00:01:17.540]  When you're faced with total tyranny and just absolute power grabbing, you have to counter it with what it is.
[00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:29.000]  Not be like, well that sounds a little extreme to say Obama's trying to become a dictator, or stage Benghazi to ship weapons to Al Qaeda, or stage Fast and Furious, or sold out the country to China.
[00:01:30.221 --> 00:01:40.712]  But now, this is coming up in the next segment, Rand Paul has demanded Democrats return money raised by quote, sexual predator Bill Clinton.
[00:01:41.656 --> 00:01:43.437]  That's how you take these criminals down.
[00:01:44.058 --> 00:01:46.079]  You should get hard core.
[00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:49.461]  And we have the video of Rand Paul saying that.
[00:01:49.721 --> 00:01:50.902]  I just, I love it.
[00:01:50.922 --> 00:01:54.364]  We're going to have an arms race now of who can turn the rhetoric up.
[00:01:55.792 --> 00:02:04.914]  And notice the social engineers and the gatekeepers and the people that try to tell you how to think and what to do at MSNBC and CNN are always, it's discrediting to turn the rhetoric up.
[00:02:05.394 --> 00:02:07.135]  It's discrediting to be mean.
[00:02:07.675 --> 00:02:15.617]  It's discrediting to use all these volatile terms while they use, you're a Klan member if you own a gun.
[00:02:15.957 --> 00:02:18.137]  If you don't like Obamacare, it's because you hate black people.
[00:02:18.197 --> 00:02:21.638]  I mean, that's over the top, hardcore rhetoric based in lies.
[00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:24.899]  But Bill Clinton settled cases.
[00:02:27.185 --> 00:02:42.648]  If you followed this back in 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, like I did, on radio every day, where he would literally just rape women on a routine basis, break their jaws, beat the living daylights out of them, and he would settle the lawsuits.
[00:02:43.028 --> 00:02:47.249]  I'm not going to get into what he did to the women, but it included biting bloody chunks out of them.
[00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:52.490]  I mean, we're talking hardcore Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer type behavior, okay?
[00:02:54.127 --> 00:02:56.991]  And then if people spoke out about it, he'd have their arms broken.
[00:02:57.691 --> 00:03:00.255]  I'm telling you though, I hope they don't blow up Rand Paul's airplane.
[00:03:00.615 --> 00:03:01.917]  And, you know, when he's flying or something.
[00:03:01.937 --> 00:03:02.858]  Because here's the issue.
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.383]  If we get everybody talking like this, they can't kill us all.
[00:03:08.066 --> 00:03:10.908]  That's why I love to get other talk show hosts on.
[00:03:10.948 --> 00:03:12.429]  I don't want to walk point in this thing.
[00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.210]  It's not because I don't even want to die.
[00:03:14.571 --> 00:03:15.371]  I mean, I want to win.
[00:03:16.012 --> 00:03:18.894]  We win by getting everybody telling the truth, everybody going public.
[00:03:19.194 --> 00:03:28.060]  The story is up on DrudgeReport.com, the place that broke the original Monica Lewinsky story that opened up all the sexual garbage.
[00:03:28.621 --> 00:03:35.826]  By the way, the word is, and I'm going to talk about this later, I've never met Jay Leno, but I know a lot of folks that know Jay Leno and have been on his show.
[00:03:36.823 --> 00:03:39.926]  And they've told me Jay Leno brings up, you know, hey, Alex Jones, you like him?
[00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:40.666]  I like his show.
[00:03:41.427 --> 00:03:45.130]  And then about a year ago, we got contacted by the Jay Leno people, one of their main producers.
[00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.411]  They said, well, Jay wants to get you on.
[00:03:47.452 --> 00:03:50.634]  He listens to the show every day, every day.
[00:03:51.755 --> 00:03:54.217]  And we listen all the time and get a lot of material from the show.
[00:03:54.237 --> 00:03:54.738]  And I said, really?
[00:03:54.758 --> 00:03:55.879]  And they said, oh, you'd be surprised.
[00:03:57.056 --> 00:04:00.119]  Uh, and, uh, but, and then later they said, no, it's too political.
[00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:01.240]  They won't let him.
[00:04:01.921 --> 00:04:03.482]  Well, that's the article out today.
[00:04:03.602 --> 00:04:04.924]  Infowars.com.
[00:04:05.304 --> 00:04:09.428]  Was Jay Leno canned by NBC for criticizing Obama?
[00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:18.096]  And he would make jokes that were just, I mean, completely obvious that, you know, that, hey, there really is a big bro in Washington and he really does listen.
[00:04:18.985 --> 00:04:19.985]  Through the NSA to you.
[00:04:20.686 --> 00:04:27.308]  And jokes like that, and, hey, you know, he said you could keep your doctor, but now you can't keep it, but he never said you couldn't keep it, even though he said you could keep it.
[00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.409]  I mean, that's good comic material.
[00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.692]  And Jon Stewart's done it some, but his brother's the head of the New York Stock Exchange, and he's really kind of a made man.
[00:04:37.253 --> 00:04:40.435]  And everybody's turned against Obama, so he does a little bit of it, but he kind of makes it a joke.
[00:04:40.956 --> 00:04:41.636]  Jay Leno.
[00:04:42.396 --> 00:04:43.377]  Here's the deal in Hollywood.
[00:04:43.397 --> 00:04:45.178]  If you're libertarian or conservative, you're gone.
[00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:47.300]  And they don't let you do it.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:54.945]  See, Stewart's a liberal, so he's then allowed to attack Obama just because Obama's so unpopular.
[00:04:55.805 --> 00:04:57.126]  They're deserting the sinking ship.
[00:04:57.206 --> 00:05:00.148]  But Jay Leno is a libertarian, is a lister of the show.
[00:05:00.549 --> 00:05:03.751]  And I'm not saying that's the reason he's fired, but that just gives you an example of why they don't like him.
[00:05:03.771 --> 00:05:06.312]  Jay Leno's a really good guy from folks I know that know him.
[00:05:06.432 --> 00:05:06.933]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:09.894 --> 00:05:11.515]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:05:11.776 --> 00:05:15.277]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:05:15.418 --> 00:05:19.820]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.943]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:05:26.063 --> 00:05:27.224]  Advanced manufacturing technology.
[00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:27.424]  I think?
[00:05:50.208 --> 00:06:00.537]  Chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:06:00.857 --> 00:06:06.161]  Get your Pro-Pure with the new Pro-1 filters today at infowarstore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:06:09.887 --> 00:06:10.728]  The facts are in.
[00:06:10.908 --> 00:06:12.030]  The studies are legion.
[00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:19.699]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:23.303]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:06:23.663 --> 00:06:24.064]  Simple.
[00:06:24.224 --> 00:06:28.589]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:06:28.929 --> 00:06:34.395]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:06:34.655 --> 00:06:50.673]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:06:50.973 --> 00:06:55.217]  Let's take a stand against the Globalist by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[00:06:55.557 --> 00:06:57.399]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[00:06:57.719 --> 00:07:03.004]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[00:07:03.264 --> 00:07:07.528]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[00:07:07.688 --> 00:07:09.009]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:18.836]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:07:18.896 --> 00:07:26.982]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:07:27.302 --> 00:07:27.562]  We are.
[00:07:57.162 --> 00:07:57.662]  I don't think so.
[00:08:24.427 --> 00:08:30.713]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.621]  I'm a fire starter.
[00:08:40.482 --> 00:08:41.623]  You're a fire starter.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.421]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m.
[00:08:56.461 --> 00:08:56.821]  to 2 p.m.
[00:08:56.861 --> 00:08:57.201]  Central.
[00:08:57.561 --> 00:08:59.422]  We're here.
[00:09:01.662 --> 00:09:04.843]  And then you've got, of course, the Sunday transmission, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:09:07.864 --> 00:09:09.765]  Central Standard Time as well.
[00:09:09.805 --> 00:09:15.487]  The news websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:09:16.767 --> 00:09:18.428]  There is so much news going on.
[00:09:18.448 --> 00:09:41.266]  We've got former congressman Bob Barr back on because I wanted to pick his brain about all the new scandals coming out and his move that got demonized in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and on CNN and on MSNBC on this broadcast two weeks ago saying he will move to impeach Obama if he's re-elected to the Congress from the district outside Atlanta.
[00:09:42.532 --> 00:09:44.493]  Just I guess northwest of Atlanta, going into Atlanta.
[00:09:45.033 --> 00:09:51.537]  And he is about 30 points ahead of all his competition right now in an uncontested race with the Democrats.
[00:09:52.097 --> 00:09:57.280]  So barring them killing him or setting him up, he's gonna get back in.
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.522]  And people go, well, hey, Bob Barr was in Congress for a long time.
[00:09:59.542 --> 00:10:00.162]  What's the big deal?
[00:10:00.602 --> 00:10:01.603]  His time has now come.
[00:10:02.805 --> 00:10:10.152]  I can look at Rand Paul, I can look at Ted Cruz and their leadership that's absolutely delightful and bullying and heartening.
[00:10:10.812 --> 00:10:14.316]  And then I look at somebody like Bob Barr, it's just going to be incredible.
[00:10:14.596 --> 00:10:16.037]  It's going to be absolutely incredible.
[00:10:16.538 --> 00:10:21.903]  And I see this as more major players in the fight for true libertarian constitutional ideas.
[00:10:22.303 --> 00:10:24.165]  We can beat the globalists.
[00:10:25.589 --> 00:10:26.909]  They're not invincible, folks.
[00:10:27.349 --> 00:10:34.591]  We have to first understand we have the moral high ground, we have the history, we have the Americana, we have the way out of all the problems.
[00:10:35.972 --> 00:10:44.554]  The only problem is it will create so much prosperity that America will become so rich again that we'll become decadent slobs and become enslaved again.
[00:10:45.754 --> 00:10:48.375]  But we're kind of in that flux point right now.
[00:10:48.515 --> 00:10:54.857]  Four percent of the world's population, half the world's wealth until the 1990s, and then they've drained about half that off now.
[00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:57.911]  We had the biggest middle class.
[00:10:57.971 --> 00:10:58.891]  In fact, the U.S.
[00:10:58.951 --> 00:11:05.235]  middle class, by some metrics, you can look this up, was bigger than all other middle classes combined.
[00:11:07.316 --> 00:11:18.282]  Now, until about the 1950s, Argentina had the biggest per capita middle class in the world, and there was a saying called, he's as rich as an Argentine.
[00:11:20.803 --> 00:11:24.906]  They got a corrupt kleptocratic government, devalued the currency, shut up combines, monopolies,
[00:11:25.856 --> 00:11:27.898]  Argentina is a literal hell pit.
[00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.800]  I've talked to friends and family that have been there recently.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.121]  Countryside.
[00:11:31.261 --> 00:11:32.082]  It's a beautiful country.
[00:11:32.402 --> 00:11:33.043]  Major cities.
[00:11:33.343 --> 00:11:33.824]  Hell pit.
[00:11:35.014 --> 00:11:43.539]  And you see, you can see this online, the photos and videos, good-looking families, these are not drunks or mentally ill people, living in doorways all over the place.
[00:11:44.239 --> 00:11:46.380]  People that were formerly doctors, lawyers, you name it.
[00:11:46.781 --> 00:11:53.564]  They have taken a country just like America was and literally, literally run it into the ground.
[00:11:53.905 --> 00:12:00.208]  Argentina had more money in 1900 per capita than the United States did in the 50s.
[00:12:00.869 --> 00:12:02.950]  And they have wrecked it.
[00:12:04.179 --> 00:12:06.841]  Absolutely, completely wrecked it.
[00:12:08.943 --> 00:12:09.723]  And that's a big bummer.
[00:12:10.424 --> 00:12:11.825]  There's not many places to go.
[00:12:12.325 --> 00:12:14.347]  I wish there were a bunch of free, rich countries.
[00:12:15.128 --> 00:12:17.710]  I love America, but man, if it falls, I want somewhere to go.
[00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:19.611]  And there isn't, except for Switzerland.
[00:12:20.832 --> 00:12:22.914]  And a few northern European countries, maybe Iceland.
[00:12:26.296 --> 00:12:28.858]  And it really bums me out to see this happening.
[00:12:30.059 --> 00:12:31.140]  To say the least, obviously.
[00:12:32.856 --> 00:12:43.592]  And so the gatekeepers, they want to sit there while they kleptocratically divide and conquer and subdivide and strip mine like a corporate takeover.
[00:12:45.231 --> 00:12:46.531]  And sell off of our country.
[00:12:46.571 --> 00:12:48.672]  That's what's happening in Greece, that's what's happening here now.
[00:12:48.712 --> 00:13:08.635]  They're announcing in The Economist, it's literally published by the Rothschilds, controlled press, that, oh, we're going to sell off all the infrastructure, all the public land, but not sell it off, they're going to give it to the big banks, going, oh, because, see, they sign us onto their debt, and then turn it around and go, oh, we're in debt, but the big banks are going to emergency reorganize things, and now we're going to hand over all our infrastructure.
[00:13:09.015 --> 00:13:13.996]  I'm all for taking public lands, not so much the national parks, keep those pristine, need a mix of things.
[00:13:14.676 --> 00:13:20.879]  But the 80% of the West, roughly, that's federal land, and opening it up to be literally given to people?
[00:13:22.359 --> 00:13:25.821]  How about you give veterans a thousand acres?
[00:13:27.382 --> 00:13:29.863]  They've got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of acres.
[00:13:30.263 --> 00:13:34.045]  How about you give veterans a thousand acres tax-free for life?
[00:13:35.945 --> 00:13:36.626]  How about you give
[00:13:39.637 --> 00:13:45.401]  Have a lottery program for people that have done good deeds that get nominated in every town and city to get state and federal land.
[00:13:45.921 --> 00:13:52.145]  Literally, folks, in most states, 60, 70, 80, 90% of the land is state or federal, and a mix of those.
[00:13:52.745 --> 00:13:55.907]  Some states are 96% state or federal.
[00:13:58.588 --> 00:14:00.389]  So, you want to have privatization?
[00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.191]  Go west, young man!
[00:14:03.271 --> 00:14:07.814]  Haven't you been told California's full of whiskey, women, and gold?
[00:14:09.175 --> 00:14:10.896]  That's what made this country great.
[00:14:12.437 --> 00:14:15.299]  That's why my ancestors came into Texas on both sides in 1829.
[00:14:15.339 --> 00:14:17.520]  Actually, one of them before that.
[00:14:18.381 --> 00:14:18.961]  William Ayers.
[00:14:19.482 --> 00:14:19.982]  David Ayers.
[00:14:23.604 --> 00:14:24.005]  And others.
[00:14:25.626 --> 00:14:33.611]  And when they came into Texas and the Joneses and the Johnsons and the Browns came into Texas, all the same areas Texas where Texas was started, they came here and
[00:14:35.819 --> 00:14:38.981]  Okay, Mexican citizens to get land at three cents an acre.
[00:14:41.001 --> 00:14:43.042]  And that's what it's all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:43.082 --> 00:14:44.103]  That's where the wealth is.
[00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:48.245]  But under Agenda 21, they want to force us all into these compact cities.
[00:14:49.566 --> 00:14:54.908]  And when you realize that Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and Rahm Emanuel, I mean, think about each one of those people.
[00:14:54.948 --> 00:14:58.270]  These are actual gutter-level thugs.
[00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:03.212]  I mean, Bill Clinton is an actual total cokehead, nose like a vacuum cleaner.
[00:15:03.912 --> 00:15:04.793]  Roger Clinton said,
[00:15:06.459 --> 00:15:12.124]  A guy who's settled with a bunch of women, where he'd have them at a dinner and say, step in the cloakroom with me for a second.
[00:15:12.604 --> 00:15:19.270]  He'd get a woman in, punch her in the face, bloody her nose, and then bite her lip with blood dripping.
[00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:21.912]  That's a high-tech rapist technique, by the way.
[00:15:21.972 --> 00:15:23.253]  Only real psychopaths know that.
[00:15:23.754 --> 00:15:25.215]  They don't even talk about it, give people ideas.
[00:15:25.495 --> 00:15:30.680]  And you bite while you talk to them, and you say, you take your panties off right now, I'm gonna bite your lip off.
[00:15:31.479 --> 00:15:35.423]  You understand, I hate to talk like that, but that's what came out in court that Bill Clinton would do.
[00:15:35.743 --> 00:15:49.175]  Start strangling a woman, bite their face, and then Gloria Steinem and all of them, when this came out in the, like, 1997-98, right during the impeachment, they all came to his aid, because they're there to ruin women.
[00:15:51.297 --> 00:15:52.979]  Hillary's humiliation, how she
[00:15:54.562 --> 00:15:56.343]  Swept Bill Clinton's affair under the carpet.
[00:15:56.363 --> 00:16:01.505]  And they all made it about the affair of Monica Lewinsky and Paula Jones and all the rest of this.
[00:16:01.825 --> 00:16:06.967]  I mean, I've interviewed the people who've been tortured and beaten up by Bill Clinton's folks.
[00:16:07.548 --> 00:16:15.111]  And so I told Don Salazar to go dig up some of those names and people and, you know, who it happened to, and put it in the article.
[00:16:16.252 --> 00:16:18.973]  There's a story up on Drudge that's from the Washington Times.
[00:16:19.433 --> 00:16:23.635]  Rand Paul demands Dems return money raised by sexual predator Bill Clinton.
[00:16:24.411 --> 00:16:26.412]  We're going to play the video in a moment.
[00:16:26.932 --> 00:16:28.313]  But that's it.
[00:16:28.393 --> 00:16:37.697]  Why always be on the defense while they arrest Dinesh D'Souza, and while they arrest governors for no reason, who's a rising star against Hillary.
[00:16:38.358 --> 00:16:45.461]  And I don't like Chris Christie, but they're like obsessing over some bridge deal and all the rest of it, while Democrats do stuff literally a thousand times worse.
[00:16:45.721 --> 00:16:46.422]  And again, I'm just...
[00:16:47.242 --> 00:16:50.984]  I'm a big critic of Republicans when they're on office as well, and of Boehner, and all of them.
[00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:55.046]  My thing is the Democrats really are the gutter scum of the earth.
[00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:58.928]  I don't mean the well-meaning camp followers.
[00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:05.191]  And they really are gangsters, and Gloria Steinem and all these fake feminists do not have the moral high ground.
[00:17:05.772 --> 00:17:07.613]  They are not consistent about women's rights.
[00:17:07.953 --> 00:17:09.734]  They are not consistent about anybody's rights.
[00:17:11.055 --> 00:17:13.536]  Somebody like Camille Paglia is consistent.
[00:17:13.916 --> 00:17:15.976]  These people are not feminists, okay?
[00:17:16.196 --> 00:17:17.717]  They don't want women owning guns.
[00:17:17.957 --> 00:17:19.057]  They don't want women empowered.
[00:17:19.477 --> 00:17:20.398]  I have two daughters.
[00:17:21.138 --> 00:17:32.461]  I want them to be the most informed, educated, healthy, smart, dynamic, armed, beautiful, vicious, 21st century caveman women.
[00:17:33.507 --> 00:17:34.849]  Because I'm a caveman too, folks.
[00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:35.691]  I'm natural.
[00:17:35.711 --> 00:17:36.532]  I've got my instincts.
[00:17:36.953 --> 00:17:37.775]  I want to be like that.
[00:17:38.235 --> 00:17:40.259]  And I want my son to be powerful.
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:41.281]  And strong.
[00:17:41.782 --> 00:17:42.864]  Because I want to be free.
[00:17:44.567 --> 00:17:46.490]  And so the media is trying to act like it's outrageous.
[00:17:47.654 --> 00:17:49.275]  But the media is out of bullets, folks.
[00:17:49.555 --> 00:17:50.636]  They're out of political bullets.
[00:17:50.656 --> 00:17:53.318]  That's what I told Politico years ago when Rand Paul got elected.
[00:17:53.358 --> 00:17:54.779]  I said, listen, don't you get it?
[00:17:54.899 --> 00:17:57.240]  You need to endorse Rand Paul to destroy Rand Paul.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:05.185]  Even if you don't like him, your endorsement will destroy him because the people run like the plague from the New York Times.
[00:18:05.926 --> 00:18:08.787]  And so they fence it out into Politico and then people run from that.
[00:18:09.068 --> 00:18:10.469]  They're running from you.
[00:18:11.269 --> 00:18:12.450]  We're sick of you.
[00:18:12.891 --> 00:18:22.782]  We know you're a bunch of con artists, globalist crooks and thugs, and a gang using social engineering to sabotage society so you can rule the pile of crud.
[00:18:24.403 --> 00:18:28.248]  And the answer is Bob Barr saying if he gets back in he's going to impeach Obama.
[00:18:28.268 --> 00:18:31.111]  He's the guy that introduced the Articles of Impeachment with Shippers and the rest of them.
[00:18:32.179 --> 00:18:34.420]  The answer is have Ted Cruz go at the jugular.
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.801]  The answer is have Rand Paul go at the jugular.
[00:18:37.041 --> 00:18:38.842]  The answer is have Alex Jones go at the jugular.
[00:18:39.082 --> 00:18:40.343]  And Matt Drudge go at the jugular.
[00:18:40.603 --> 00:18:42.104]  And Joseph Farah go at the jugular.
[00:18:42.484 --> 00:18:44.925]  And Glenn Beck go at the jugular.
[00:18:45.987 --> 00:18:50.869]  Listen, we're not going to beat these people playing games and quarter measures.
[00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:55.732]  We've got to all in, move the Overton window back to reality.
[00:18:55.952 --> 00:19:02.755]  They've got it all extreme where if you criticize five-year-olds being taught how to be transvestites or transgender, you're a homophobe.
[00:19:03.536 --> 00:19:07.998]  Or if you don't want five-year-olds being taught how to have anal sex, you're a homophobe.
[00:19:08.598 --> 00:19:12.320]  Or if you don't want to give illegal aliens free everything, no other country does that.
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.821]  We're going bankrupt, you hate Mexicans.
[00:19:15.101 --> 00:19:17.283]  It's all them with fake moral high ground.
[00:19:17.923 --> 00:19:35.353]  We have all the ammo, Benghazi, and NSA, and IRS, and just all the lying, and the cheating, and Obamacare, and the fraud, and all of it to totally destroy these people, overthrow the Republican establishment, have the Libertarians take over, and literally save the country.
[00:19:36.753 --> 00:19:41.176]  Or, if they keep taking over and we lose this round, they'll all just get to blame the globalists
[00:19:42.839 --> 00:19:44.260]  And so we'll just win in the next round.
[00:19:44.481 --> 00:19:45.742]  Because resistance is victory.
[00:19:45.982 --> 00:19:47.083]  Never giving up is victory.
[00:19:47.243 --> 00:19:49.925]  We're just as good as the scum that runs the New World Order.
[00:19:49.965 --> 00:19:50.386]  We're better.
[00:19:50.786 --> 00:19:52.007]  We just don't cheat like them.
[00:19:52.908 --> 00:19:53.789]  We've got the power.
[00:19:56.451 --> 00:19:58.453]  We've got the mouths like alligators.
[00:19:59.454 --> 00:20:02.456]  It's time to get aggressive and eat these people alive.
[00:20:02.777 --> 00:20:04.538]  It's time to gut up and stomp.
[00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:06.120]  It's time to get aggressive!
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.881]  Time to get back in their face!
[00:20:10.089 --> 00:20:11.489]  My husband's the gun guy.
[00:20:11.709 --> 00:20:13.430]  I've just never felt comfortable with them.
[00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:15.950]  But these days, I know I need protection.
[00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:18.951]  And I found it at TheUltimateKnife.com.
[00:20:19.111 --> 00:20:20.632]  It fits my hand like a glove.
[00:20:20.812 --> 00:20:23.032]  Plus, it's small enough to easily conceal.
[00:20:23.172 --> 00:20:25.633]  And the peace of mind it gives me is unbeatable.

[00:20:41.041 --> 00:20:42.442]  My name is Jessica Armand.
[00:20:42.562 --> 00:20:45.243]  I'm an activist, a GCN listener, and mother of three.
[00:20:45.403 --> 00:20:50.085]  Our drinking water and food are filled with fluoride and other contaminants that harm our teeth and gums.
[00:20:50.245 --> 00:20:55.427]  To protect my family, I created My Magic Mud, an all-natural teeth whitening and strengthening remedy.

[00:21:10.106 --> 00:21:12.667]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:21:12.928 --> 00:21:17.810]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:25.934]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:21:26.175 --> 00:21:30.497]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:21:30.717 --> 00:21:34.519]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:21:34.679 --> 00:21:40.381]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:21:40.621 --> 00:21:43.402]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:21:43.782 --> 00:21:49.023]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:21:49.163 --> 00:21:57.286]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[00:21:57.606 --> 00:21:58.146]  Do business
[00:22:09.749 --> 00:22:17.310]  If you ever wanted to get off the grid and start generating your own supply of electricity, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:22.271]  Hi, I'm Brian Brady with a time-sensitive solar generator offer from Solutions from Science.
[00:22:22.471 --> 00:22:32.353]  Remember, solar generators provide life-saving electrical power, and unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce free electricity from the sun.
[00:22:32.373 --> 00:22:33.253]  Here's the good news.
[00:22:33.713 --> 00:22:38.558]  Our Power Hub solar generator, on sale now, is one of our most powerful solar generators.

[00:22:48.208 --> 00:22:51.271]  Even better, with dramatic price reductions on the Power Hub.
[00:22:51.451 --> 00:22:59.221]  With bonuses worth thousands of dollars, there's never been a better time to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electricity.

[00:23:14.079 --> 00:23:17.861]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break-in this year.
[00:23:19.162 --> 00:23:20.883]  Burglars call it smash and grab.
[00:23:21.243 --> 00:23:22.524]  Police call it robbery.
[00:23:23.444 --> 00:23:24.845]  We call it avoidable.
[00:23:25.345 --> 00:23:30.968]  We are Fake TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.
[00:23:31.388 --> 00:23:36.291]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television.
[00:23:36.791 --> 00:23:42.815]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move on to an easier target.
[00:23:44.015 --> 00:23:50.719]  At only $29.95, Fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans and comes with free shipping.
[00:23:51.059 --> 00:23:54.942]  Order your Fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to Faketv.com.

[00:23:56.383 --> 00:23:58.444]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:38.784]  Look at how the Democrats are literally beyond Joseph McCarthy.
[00:24:38.824 --> 00:24:40.785]  We're 1,500 Hollywood people.
[00:24:41.386 --> 00:24:47.851]  The New York Times reported three weeks ago, are in a secret society of libertarians and conservatives.
[00:24:48.431 --> 00:24:52.675]  And now the IRS is trying to find out a list of names to persecute them.
[00:24:54.142 --> 00:24:56.543]  I knew about the secret society five years ago.
[00:24:57.024 --> 00:24:58.544]  They call it a secret society.
[00:24:59.145 --> 00:25:08.410]  All it is, is conservatives meeting in secret, talking about ways to try to put libertarian ideas, or really libertarians, into films, movies.
[00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:10.991]  I went and saw Nut Job.
[00:25:12.947 --> 00:25:16.328]  With my children a few weeks ago, and I guarantee you that's a libertarian made that.
[00:25:16.988 --> 00:25:21.168]  It's all about Agenda 21, all about the government controlling the food, all about food stamps.
[00:25:21.809 --> 00:25:23.949]  Really a good movie for your children to see, I think.
[00:25:24.809 --> 00:25:37.251]  And the fact is, if I was a liberal, communist, socialist, well-meaning person, not one of the social engineer types, I would be freaked out if libertarians and conservatives were being persecuted.
[00:25:38.511 --> 00:25:41.432]  When Bush did a little bit of persecution, I came out against him real hard.
[00:25:42.864 --> 00:25:45.265]  And I called for Bush's impeachment over the NSA spying.
[00:25:47.006 --> 00:25:47.686]  And things like that.
[00:25:47.706 --> 00:25:52.628]  It's just that now, who can deny that under Obama, it is just off the charts.
[00:25:53.788 --> 00:26:07.874]  And they want to have the moral high ground where they can run scam energy deals in Benghazi and persecute people with the NSA and the IRS and now they're back with the IRS persecuting people and have this reign of terror.
[00:26:10.393 --> 00:26:13.134]  And be arresting filmmakers and persecuting people.
[00:26:13.454 --> 00:26:14.214]  This is real.
[00:26:16.295 --> 00:26:16.995]  This is real.
[00:26:17.095 --> 00:26:18.715]  They want to keep media on a short leash.
[00:26:19.036 --> 00:26:21.076]  And we have the article up on Infowars.com.
[00:26:22.016 --> 00:26:29.779]  Where Jay Leno, Paul Watson asked the question, was Jay Leno canned by NBC for criticizing Obama?
[00:26:31.839 --> 00:26:34.680]  And I should call Watson and I'll go ahead and talk about this.
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.501]  We have the emails and the calls and I can prove it if people want me to.
[00:26:39.066 --> 00:26:44.181]  We were contacted by Jay Leno's people repeatedly a couple years ago and then late last year.
[00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:49.533]  And he was going to try to sneak me on there, try to get me on the schedule.
[00:26:50.053 --> 00:26:52.014]  He talked about me many times over the years.
[00:26:52.415 --> 00:27:02.241]  Jay Leno was the first national person, I've been on a few national shows, but in 1999 he talked about some of the stuff I was doing.
[00:27:02.261 --> 00:27:06.964]  It was very obscure, very weird, no one knew why I did it, no one knew who I was.
[00:27:07.505 --> 00:27:08.886]  Jay Leno obviously did it.
[00:27:08.906 --> 00:27:11.968]  Now I've learned in the last few years that Jay Leno, again, in the
[00:27:13.206 --> 00:27:22.092]  You know, we'll come back and visit people in the powder room, uh, in the, uh, oh, what do you call the areas they haven't... And that's not the green rooms, the dressing rooms.
[00:27:22.873 --> 00:27:28.697]  And they walk around and say hi to the guests in the dressing rooms, and he's brought me up to quite a few people.
[00:27:29.218 --> 00:27:37.223]  And again, it's not like the show's even that big a deal anymore in media, it's just that the ratings were actually going up compared to other shows, and the word is they can't name it, because again,
[00:27:38.223 --> 00:27:39.584]  He was not a total communist.
[00:27:39.924 --> 00:27:41.286]  He was not a total authoritarian.
[00:27:41.786 --> 00:27:42.907]  He was a free market guy.
[00:27:43.307 --> 00:27:44.008]  And they got rid of him.
[00:27:45.009 --> 00:27:46.150]  And this is what they do.
[00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:51.814]  Just like James Woods said, he's been told since he criticized Obama, he'll never work again.
[00:27:52.415 --> 00:27:54.957]  This is a guy that made 15, 20, 30 million dollars a year.
[00:27:55.518 --> 00:27:56.358]  This is a big deal.
[00:27:56.638 --> 00:28:03.905]  So when Rand Paul comes out and says Obama's a sexual predator, excuse me, Freudian slip, Clinton's a sexual predator,
[00:28:04.918 --> 00:28:15.325]  That's the type of rhetoric we need because it's true and it gives us the offensive instead of just laying there and taking it from these crooks that sit there and lecture us.
[00:28:15.505 --> 00:28:19.268]  What about how Bill Clinton keeps half the money on record from the charities?
[00:28:20.209 --> 00:28:23.411]  For his private jet fleet and his houses for kids in Haiti.
[00:28:23.871 --> 00:28:24.652]  He's a scumbag!
[00:28:24.712 --> 00:28:25.232]  Call him out!
[00:28:25.492 --> 00:28:27.254]  Here's Rand Paul talking about it on C-SPAN.
[00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:29.813]  Senator, let me follow up on two final points.
[00:28:29.873 --> 00:28:35.260]  First of all, you made some headlines when you referred to former President Bill Clinton as, quote, a sexual predator.
[00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:40.567]  And one of your colleagues, Senator Claire McCaskill, said that your comments were, in her words, infuriating.
[00:28:40.947 --> 00:28:41.528]  Your reaction?
[00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:48.775]  Senator McCaskill needs to remember what she had to say about Bill Clinton, that she wouldn't want her daughter in the same room with him.
[00:28:49.236 --> 00:28:50.937]  So they can't have it both ways.
[00:28:50.977 --> 00:29:07.652]  The Democrats can't say, we're the great defenders of women's rights in the workplace and we will defend you against some kind of abusive boss that uses their position of authority to take advantage of a young woman, when the leader of their party, the leading fundraiser in the country,
[00:29:08.252 --> 00:29:08.592]  I think?
[00:29:27.165 --> 00:29:35.151]  By all means do, but you can't do it and take it from a guy who is using his position of authority to take advantage of young women in the workplace.
[00:29:35.431 --> 00:29:47.521]  I mean, for goodness sakes, he paid an $800,000 fine for sexual harassment, so he admitted to it in one court case, and really, I think, has been convicted in the public place for the other sexual harassment.
[00:29:47.541 --> 00:29:55.367]  And because his crimes are so outrageous, no one will even talk about what came out in the news, settling cases for raping women, biting them, beating them up, choking them.
[00:29:56.067 --> 00:29:58.849]  I mean, we're gonna repost all those old articles from the 90s.
[00:29:59.269 --> 00:30:00.150]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:01.671]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:01.691 --> 00:30:02.311]  Good job, Rand Paul.
[00:30:02.572 --> 00:30:03.372]  That's leadership, buddy.
[00:30:03.412 --> 00:30:05.374]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:05.394 --> 00:30:05.934]  Let's give them hell.
[00:30:06.174 --> 00:30:06.494]  Let's go!
[00:30:06.514 --> 00:30:06.935]  Let's go!
[00:30:06.995 --> 00:30:07.235]  Go!
[00:30:07.315 --> 00:30:07.595]  Go!
[00:30:07.855 --> 00:30:07.955]  Go!
[00:30:07.995 --> 00:30:08.075]  Go!
[00:30:08.115 --> 00:30:08.676]  Get aggressive!
[00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:20.117]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:30:20.457 --> 00:30:22.318]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:30:22.498 --> 00:30:23.199]  Fluoride!
[00:30:23.379 --> 00:30:24.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:31.624]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:30:31.884 --> 00:30:36.665]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:30:36.805 --> 00:30:42.867]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[00:30:43.127 --> 00:30:45.287]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[00:30:45.527 --> 00:30:48.168]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[00:30:48.468 --> 00:30:51.829]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[00:30:51.969 --> 00:30:57.194]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:30:57.415 --> 00:31:02.220]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:17.612]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:31:17.792 --> 00:31:24.977]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:31:25.117 --> 00:31:30.521]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.

[00:31:55.438 --> 00:31:57.899]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.

[00:33:06.441 --> 00:33:16.746]  This is an emergency transmission from FEMA Region 6 in Occupy
[00:33:23.473 --> 00:33:24.494]  There is a war.
[00:33:24.935 --> 00:33:25.936]  It's happening now.
[00:33:26.817 --> 00:33:28.599]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.962]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:33:31.743 --> 00:33:33.185]  We are the resistance.
[00:33:33.645 --> 00:33:35.207]  We are the Infowar.
[00:33:40.541 --> 00:33:50.928]  Ladies and gentlemen, again, thank you so much for joining us on this live Friday, 7th day of February 2014.
[00:33:52.229 --> 00:33:54.310]  I'm going to be the big 40 next Tuesday.
[00:33:55.211 --> 00:33:58.293]  Wow, 40 years old, 40 years young.
[00:33:58.713 --> 00:34:02.075]  For a lot of people, that is super young to even get into media by the time you're 40.
[00:34:02.476 --> 00:34:06.438]  I've been doing this since I was 21 years old.
[00:34:07.039 --> 00:34:10.041]  So I'm kind of long in the tooth when it comes to media careers.
[00:34:11.181 --> 00:34:25.286]  Coming up from the very, very grassroots bottom, the true American success story, promoting ideas of liberty, reporting muckraking news stories that they call conspiracy theories that are now, unfortunately, all mainstream news.
[00:34:25.806 --> 00:34:26.666]  Simply amazing.
[00:34:27.547 --> 00:34:33.529]  Getting back, though, to Rand Paul and Bob Barr, who's going to really be a dynamite watch once he gets into Congress.
[00:34:34.309 --> 00:34:41.412]  And of course, I'm going to be encouraging him to be vicious, because in the face of viciousness, you've got to be vicious back.
[00:34:42.013 --> 00:34:50.917]  And the fake moral high ground of Bill Clinton and Obama and Michelle and just all of them, I'm sick of it.
[00:34:52.078 --> 00:35:00.282]  That, oh, they're the liberals, so they're allowed to keep half the money from the Haitian fund so Bill Clinton can have a fleet of $40 million jets paid for.
[00:35:01.142 --> 00:35:02.823]  It's not a fleet, he has like three of them, I was reading.
[00:35:04.062 --> 00:35:08.623]  A group they lease of three jets, so he has whole entourages on wide-body jets.
[00:35:08.643 --> 00:35:11.844]  They're like $100,000 per leg, basically.
[00:35:12.104 --> 00:35:13.644]  The most expensive stuff you can have.
[00:35:14.244 --> 00:35:18.205]  I mean, other than Google having brand new, you know, 777s or whatever.
[00:35:18.926 --> 00:35:21.806]  I mean, this is out of control.
[00:35:23.387 --> 00:35:25.067]  I guess Google just bought a Dreamliner, too.
[00:35:25.107 --> 00:35:26.347]  I guess that's the newest thing out there.
[00:35:26.967 --> 00:35:27.848]  You know, that's fine, whatever.
[00:35:27.868 --> 00:35:29.128]  It didn't come from Haitian kids.
[00:35:30.629 --> 00:35:38.647]  And it's just knowing these crooks, knowing what a crook Rahm Emanuel is, literally, and up there with a moral high ground.
[00:35:38.708 --> 00:35:39.409]  I'm tired of it!
[00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:46.533]  Bought and paid for by the Wall Street sharks who are literally running this country and this world into the ground.
[00:35:46.793 --> 00:35:55.198]  Now we got breaking news with David Knight on the sniper attacks on Transformers that I believe have all the earmarks of a false flag terror attack to pass cyber security.
[00:35:55.218 --> 00:36:00.781]  And we've said over and over again they're going to stage these events and then hype them to pass the internet takeover.
[00:36:01.421 --> 00:36:04.523]  They've already got the internet takeover in place, they just want to make it legal now?
[00:36:05.768 --> 00:36:09.790]  So David Knight's got the big scoop on this under-reported story.
[00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:15.613]  Because sometimes they have false flags that are just used in Congress, but they keep quiet and go, we don't want to panic the public.
[00:36:16.193 --> 00:36:27.299]  But I'd give it about a 90% chance the Obama administration staged these sniper attacks, or a branch of the Pentagon, NORTHCOM, to get cybersecurity in.
[00:36:27.899 --> 00:36:28.739]  It might, 10% chance,
[00:36:30.325 --> 00:36:41.029]  It could be a corporation doing it just because of the tens of millions these big companies will get in the cybersecurity takeover and the power they get on getting that data and being able to predict the future in controlled economies.
[00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:44.731]  So I'd give it a 100% chance it's an inside job.
[00:36:46.051 --> 00:36:54.515]  90% chance that it's the government itself because even corporations can be doubled back on and double-crossed, triple-crossed and don't like to do stuff like this.
[00:36:55.155 --> 00:36:59.157]  They like to help do false flags lovingly, of course, but they don't like
[00:37:01.189 --> 00:37:05.931]  They don't like actually getting their little paws dirty sometimes.
[00:37:06.371 --> 00:37:07.191]  So that's coming up.
[00:37:07.331 --> 00:37:10.092]  Months later, sniper attack at Power Hub.
[00:37:10.132 --> 00:37:10.913]  Still a mystery.
[00:37:11.313 --> 00:37:14.494]  New York Times and yesterday they were in Congress bringing it up.
[00:37:14.934 --> 00:37:27.959]  We've got to pass CISPA and we've got to pass cyber security takeover because in 19 minutes a team of snipers destroyed 17 transformers at a power station in California.
[00:37:28.894 --> 00:37:30.754]  And it was precision where they were shooting him.
[00:37:31.094 --> 00:37:33.195]  And then they disappeared one minute before the police arrived.
[00:37:33.515 --> 00:37:39.216]  We'll delve into this mystery with David Knight coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:37:40.076 --> 00:37:49.798]  Some of the other top stories that are so incredibly important are up on InfoWars.com.
[00:37:49.998 --> 00:37:55.099]  Man who fled communism blast Oregon lawmakers for gun control attempt.
[00:37:55.179 --> 00:37:57.279]  Very powerful article by Mikael Thelen.
[00:37:58.561 --> 00:38:02.763]  Another article was Jay Leno canned by NBC for criticizing Obama.
[00:38:03.823 --> 00:38:04.264]  I don't know.
[00:38:04.324 --> 00:38:05.304]  Do fish swim in the ocean?
[00:38:05.324 --> 00:38:07.645]  Do bears live in the woods?
[00:38:07.665 --> 00:38:08.646]  You know my stupid sayings.
[00:38:09.166 --> 00:38:09.826]  DARPA!
[00:38:10.566 --> 00:38:11.027]  Boffin!
[00:38:11.807 --> 00:38:14.728]  Future government surveillance will be like Apple's Siri.
[00:38:15.469 --> 00:38:16.849]  Very important article by Steve Watson.
[00:38:17.329 --> 00:38:18.650]  I'm going to tie that into Bitcoin in a minute.
[00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:22.112]  Scientists confirm Fukushima radiation in California kelp.
[00:38:22.572 --> 00:38:27.214]  That's why the kelp we sell, the modifilant, is from the Southern Hemisphere, from New Zealand.
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:33.881]  Also, we have this Ambassador Newland audio, reveals State Department role in undermining Ukraine.
[00:38:33.901 --> 00:38:40.202]  They want total chaos and the breakdown of Ukraine from Russia and the EU so the big banks can come in and loot it.
[00:38:40.883 --> 00:38:46.984]  See, there's not even a national sovereignty issue now of where you do divide and conquer and order out of chaos, so you're number one.
[00:38:47.004 --> 00:38:47.684]  That's bad enough.
[00:38:48.224 --> 00:38:51.705]  Now it's purely so financial interest can liquidate
[00:38:53.251 --> 00:39:03.280]  And dissolve, like a mosquito through its proboscis injects saliva, that's why it itches so bad, that then dissolves the platelets so it can suck up a larger...
[00:39:04.437 --> 00:39:09.121]  Quota of nourishing blood and other juices.
[00:39:09.801 --> 00:39:10.341]  And that's what they do.
[00:39:10.381 --> 00:39:21.190]  They go in and dissolve a society, then pose as a savior and exsanguiate, I believe is the proper term for the proboscis, then slurping it back up, continuing.
[00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:22.871]  Think about Bill Clinton's proboscis.
[00:39:24.972 --> 00:39:25.973]  Let's continue here.
[00:39:26.273 --> 00:39:27.434]  Big ugly nose on him.
[00:39:28.035 --> 00:39:29.476]  It's usually stuck in the cocaine bucket.
[00:39:29.956 --> 00:39:30.797]  But that's because he's liberal.
[00:39:31.932 --> 00:39:33.053]  It's a good deal, Larry.
[00:39:33.393 --> 00:39:34.694]  I do not have sex with that woman.
[00:39:34.734 --> 00:39:35.574]  It's just so ridiculous.
[00:39:36.035 --> 00:39:40.638]  Continuing, Kentucky police, I never got to this, set up eating while driving checkpoints.
[00:39:40.698 --> 00:39:45.241]  That is an incredible article, and we have a video on that.
[00:39:45.261 --> 00:39:47.102]  We'll be getting to that in the next hour.
[00:39:47.122 --> 00:39:50.284]  I want to get Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on today or Sunday.
[00:39:50.304 --> 00:39:55.908]  He's got a good article about Washington destabilizes Ukraine, and that's now proven out in the open.
[00:39:56.943 --> 00:40:03.307]  And also coming up in the next hour, I will cover this in detail, Pew Study, Christians are the world's most oppressed religious group.
[00:40:03.367 --> 00:40:11.632]  One of the most prestigious polling and research groups, Pew Research, finds Christians are the most persecuted.
[00:40:13.633 --> 00:40:17.076]  They are the most persecuted by a giant long shot.
[00:40:18.396 --> 00:40:20.638]  And then after that is Muslims, Jews, others.
[00:40:23.427 --> 00:40:29.672]  Folk religions, Hindus, Buddhists, so there you go folks.
[00:40:29.692 --> 00:40:35.857]  Christians are being slaughtered and the globalists are funding that and supporting that worldwide.
[00:40:36.618 --> 00:40:40.321]  So that's some of the news that's coming up.
[00:40:40.721 --> 00:40:49.068]  By the way, Watson did a video yesterday that went viral titled, The Truth About Russia and Putin's Anti-Gay Stance.
[00:40:49.688 --> 00:40:51.350]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm a tolerant person.
[00:40:52.986 --> 00:40:58.088]  And you know, everybody knows, who's been listening to me for 18 years, that the whole sex thing is just not my bag.
[00:40:58.748 --> 00:41:01.089]  I'm not here on a high horse lecturing people all day.
[00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:04.150]  I really am not obsessed with what you do in your bedroom.
[00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:06.771]  I just want to really be honest with everybody out there.
[00:41:07.151 --> 00:41:09.672]  But I've been forced to cover it because I'm sick of it.
[00:41:10.876 --> 00:41:17.842]  I cannot watch any TV show, any movie, anything without sexualization propaganda.
[00:41:17.902 --> 00:41:22.585]  I don't care if it's heterosexual or homosexual, it's mainly homosexual, targeting my children.
[00:41:22.725 --> 00:41:23.686]  And I'm sick of it.
[00:41:25.027 --> 00:41:30.752]  And I'm sick of not being able to watch a sporting event, or the Olympics, or a sitcom, anything I watch.
[00:41:31.957 --> 00:41:40.483]  I gotta watch Turner Classic movies with my children when I let them watch TV once or twice a week, or I gotta find old cartoons or whatever, because it is just unbelievable.
[00:41:41.263 --> 00:41:49.189]  And that's all they're saying is, stay away from kids, don't push it on people, and the media is just freaking out about it.
[00:41:49.629 --> 00:41:57.235]  I actually look forward to being able to watch the Olympics with my children, except when NBC has all of the propaganda during their breaks.
[00:41:58.322 --> 00:42:05.488]  But if you're Johnny on the spot with a remote, you know, it won't show the guys or girls kissing every time you go to break.
[00:42:05.548 --> 00:42:06.870]  I mean, just stop it!
[00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:08.251]  Stop it!
[00:42:10.353 --> 00:42:10.873]  Stop it!
[00:42:10.913 --> 00:42:13.135]  I mean, stop trying to beat everybody over the head with it.
[00:42:14.817 --> 00:42:15.918]  And again, I mean, here's an example.
[00:42:15.958 --> 00:42:18.240]  Let's say I loved a steakhouse.
[00:42:20.061 --> 00:42:21.923]  Or let's say I loved a particular store.
[00:42:22.203 --> 00:42:24.885]  But if they stood outside my house beating on pots and pans,
[00:42:25.791 --> 00:42:26.952]  See, it's not like I love it.
[00:42:26.992 --> 00:42:27.452]  I just don't.
[00:42:27.913 --> 00:42:28.653]  It's not my issue.
[00:42:28.913 --> 00:42:29.734]  I don't hate anybody.
[00:42:30.354 --> 00:42:30.935]  I'm neutral.
[00:42:31.255 --> 00:42:31.876]  I'm tolerant.
[00:42:32.476 --> 00:42:43.184]  But if you stand outside my house just going, gay, gay, gay, gay, like the monkey beating the cymbals together, I mean, it gets really, really old, the way it's being pushed.
[00:42:44.165 --> 00:42:44.945]  And it needs to stop.
[00:42:45.305 --> 00:42:48.628]  And it's a cultural wedge because all our other basic liberties are being removed.
[00:42:49.408 --> 00:42:51.290]  And so they want to create these faux liberties.
[00:42:52.415 --> 00:42:56.518]  Like I saw in the news yesterday, yes, more schools in the first grade.
[00:42:57.099 --> 00:42:59.140]  You've got to let the little boys go in the girls' bathroom.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:03.964]  And little five-year-olds are not thinking about dressing like boys or girls.
[00:43:05.105 --> 00:43:06.506]  Either way, it's how your parents dress you.
[00:43:07.126 --> 00:43:09.168]  They are literally trying to sexualize our children.
[00:43:09.488 --> 00:43:10.889]  And if they can get away with that, the sky's the limit.
[00:43:10.949 --> 00:43:12.311]  I mean, I've had enough of this.
[00:43:12.371 --> 00:43:14.052]  And I'm not even defending Putin.
[00:43:16.075 --> 00:43:21.278]  I mean, the city they've picked for it is the lowest quality place where they can suck the most money out of it for the Russian mob.
[00:43:21.298 --> 00:43:25.120]  I mean, Russia's got its own sick issues, but it's amazing.
[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:27.822]  Speaking of Bitcoin, we're going to go to our big story this hour.
[00:43:28.142 --> 00:43:31.504]  Bitcoin plunges as major exchange Mt.
[00:43:31.604 --> 00:43:33.305]  Gox halts all withdrawals.
[00:43:34.398 --> 00:43:36.040]  And that's all I've ever said about Bitcoin is.
[00:43:36.781 --> 00:43:38.343]  The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[00:43:38.543 --> 00:43:40.085]  And it's just, I've had a bad feeling.
[00:43:40.645 --> 00:43:42.508]  And I'm not saying you were dumb to be part of it.
[00:43:42.548 --> 00:43:43.629]  I'm not against the currency.
[00:43:43.969 --> 00:43:46.713]  I'm all for cryptocurrencies and independent currencies.
[00:43:47.353 --> 00:43:51.238]  It's just that the government's going to use Bitcoin's fall, I believe, down the road.
[00:43:51.278 --> 00:43:51.839]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[00:43:53.339 --> 00:43:58.083]  They're going to use its fall to discredit all cryptocurrencies and basically try to arrest a bunch of people involved.
[00:43:58.483 --> 00:44:00.384]  That's why I go with my gut now.
[00:44:00.444 --> 00:44:03.567]  My gut was always right my whole life, but I was always stupid and didn't follow it.
[00:44:03.947 --> 00:44:07.049]  Now I am servile to my gut.
[00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:08.971]  Servile to it.
[00:44:09.731 --> 00:44:12.494]  And it does not steer me wrong.
[00:44:12.514 --> 00:44:18.898]  It's my conscience, my discernment, God-given gift, and you've got it too, folks, if you learn how to use it.
[00:44:21.852 --> 00:44:26.995]  Maybe it'll end up not being bad, but my gut tells me, don't walk, run away from Bitcoin.
[00:44:27.015 --> 00:44:30.717]  Everybody's going to get mad at me because it's a big liberty thing everybody's been sucked into.
[00:44:30.737 --> 00:44:33.619]  Look, aren't you glad I'm there to give you the other side about it?
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:38.282]  You made some money in it, great, but don't you feel sorry for those that are going to get caught holding the bag.
[00:44:38.582 --> 00:44:39.963]  And hey, if you want to be a stockbroker, do it.
[00:44:40.143 --> 00:44:40.864]  Go get into bubbles.
[00:44:41.584 --> 00:44:42.284]  I just don't do that.
[00:44:42.304 --> 00:44:45.026]  I know how to make incredible amounts of money in the stock market, following trends.
[00:44:45.086 --> 00:44:48.088]  I don't do it because in the final equation, it's predatory.
[00:44:49.853 --> 00:44:51.233]  I'm not saying the idea of stocks were bad.
[00:44:51.253 --> 00:44:54.154]  People used to buy stocks in ships, because you could lose ships easily.
[00:44:54.194 --> 00:45:01.856]  So if you hedge your bets, you could end up making money, and that helped create Western trade and colonize the planet.
[00:45:01.876 --> 00:45:06.978]  I'm just saying what it is today is a very, very serious situation.
[00:45:08.496 --> 00:45:17.184]  Now, David Knight, investigative journalist, InfoWars, Nightly News, co-host with Jakari Jackson, Leanne McAdoo, and of course, the great Darren McBrain.
[00:45:17.664 --> 00:45:19.946]  We did that intro you saw, we just came into the segment.
[00:45:20.927 --> 00:45:27.513]  He was telling me last time about this, I remember when it happened last year, and then the hype, and we need to pass cyber security, it's really an internet takeover because of it.
[00:45:30.029 --> 00:45:40.812]  These transformers getting shot up, and the professional job, and disappearing, you know, one minute before the police got there, and little piles of rocks to know where to do the shooting.
[00:45:41.612 --> 00:45:44.593]  Probably third-party merc team hired to do it, told they'd be given immunity.
[00:45:44.953 --> 00:45:45.913]  Probably part of a drill.
[00:45:46.694 --> 00:45:48.574]  They do drills that actually blow stuff up, folks.
[00:45:49.214 --> 00:45:51.535]  And then you just tell the public that it was real.
[00:45:52.315 --> 00:45:54.936]  They have drills that blow up buses, light things on fire, you name it.
[00:45:56.158 --> 00:46:00.780]  That's how they work these things, and then they get the cybersecurity takeover, $100 billion a year to private interest.
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:17.827]  David Knight's here to talk about it in 19 minutes, a team of snipers put 17 Transformers at a power station, and the reason this is back in the news is they're trying to use this clear false flag, and David believes, a precursor to another real larger power event, as a pretext to bring in a form of martial law.
[00:46:18.047 --> 00:46:20.648]  They won't call it that, they'll call it emergency stabilization.
[00:46:21.269 --> 00:46:24.290]  David Knight, give us your breakdown of the story you've been following for several months.
[00:46:25.185 --> 00:46:28.847]  Well, this just came out yesterday from a former F.E.R.C.
[00:46:28.947 --> 00:46:29.448]  Chairman.
[00:46:29.808 --> 00:46:30.488]  Went public with this.
[00:46:30.508 --> 00:46:34.111]  When this first happened, the utility company said it was just vandalism.
[00:46:34.651 --> 00:46:39.294]  But vandals don't go down and cut the fiber optic cables, the underground fiber optic cables.
[00:46:39.754 --> 00:46:41.255]  They don't spot this stuff carefully.
[00:46:41.655 --> 00:46:43.316]  Only Imperial Storm Troopers are so precise?
[00:46:43.336 --> 00:46:43.977]  That's right.
[00:46:44.257 --> 00:46:46.358]  They don't remove all the fingerprints from the shell casing.
[00:46:46.678 --> 00:46:49.140]  So what you see here is something that was very carefully planned.
[00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:53.904]  It was professionally executed, and it was also a measured attack.
[00:46:54.445 --> 00:47:00.650]  They could have blown up and destroyed, the people who planned this and executed this so well, they could have destroyed that entire power station.
[00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:02.892]  They could have caused a very wide outage.
[00:47:03.273 --> 00:47:08.798]  But as you mentioned before, when you have false flag attacks, you don't always target that to the public.
[00:47:09.098 --> 00:47:11.841]  Sometimes you target it to some people who are in the know.
[00:47:12.281 --> 00:47:13.822]  There have been a lot of false flags.
[00:47:13.882 --> 00:47:15.142]  Plants being blown up.
[00:47:15.622 --> 00:47:22.064]  In fact, I've been told by high-level sources there's more than 50 a year that they use to scare the cops and everybody and say, don't tell anybody.
[00:47:22.705 --> 00:47:24.745]  You're part of the group now, but we don't want to panic the public.
[00:47:24.985 --> 00:47:26.686]  And that's how they bring them into the conspiracy.
[00:47:26.946 --> 00:47:27.286]  That's right.
[00:47:27.486 --> 00:47:28.667]  So it could have been something like that.
[00:47:28.967 --> 00:47:34.729]  As you mentioned, CISPO was under consideration at the time, and CISPO was an infrastructure issue.
[00:47:35.169 --> 00:47:37.810]  So how better to emphasize that than some kind of attack like this?
[00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:43.093]  So we don't really know, but what it does look like, we can tell, that it was very carefully planned, very carefully executed.
[00:47:43.633 --> 00:47:46.715]  They took out the oil on the Transformers when they shot them.
[00:47:47.135 --> 00:47:53.218]  They drained down, it set off the alarms, the police were called, but of course they stopped shooting about a minute before the police got there.
[00:47:53.258 --> 00:47:57.740]  The police get there and it's locked, so the police just say, well I guess everything's okay.
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:47:58.921]  And leave.
[00:47:59.341 --> 00:48:01.443]  And then they put out that it was a vandalism charge.
[00:48:01.503 --> 00:48:05.187]  And so we didn't know anything about it until this broke yesterday.
[00:48:05.768 --> 00:48:09.111]  And the former chair of the F.E.R.C.
[00:48:09.131 --> 00:48:09.912]  that oversees this.
[00:48:09.952 --> 00:48:13.956]  Sure, but we were following it months ago when it happened, saying clearly this isn't vandals.
[00:48:14.116 --> 00:48:14.616]  Right, right.
[00:48:15.116 --> 00:48:18.617]  And so all this stuff is very, very suspicious that they're coming up with.
[00:48:18.737 --> 00:48:22.959]  And as I said before, it's very carefully planned, very carefully executed, but very measured.
[00:48:22.979 --> 00:48:24.719]  They could have blown up these transformers.
[00:48:24.759 --> 00:48:26.920]  They could have taken out the entire substation.
[00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:28.420]  It could have been a very public event.
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:35.303]  But instead, it was a pretty serious attack that showed a threat, showed the vulnerability, but then didn't alarm the public.
[00:48:35.343 --> 00:48:36.643]  And that's what's interesting about it, I think.
[00:48:37.793 --> 00:48:40.614]  Well, that's what they do a lot of times we've seen to get funding.
[00:48:42.134 --> 00:48:51.016]  And again, most of these terror attacks are kept secret, but a lot of lethal ones that go on, and they use it to say, oh, we're keeping the police and everybody on their toes.
[00:48:51.436 --> 00:48:53.857]  The truth is they're doing it to be able to take over society.
[00:48:54.157 --> 00:49:02.398]  And yeah, the cops on the ground are on their toes, and the Infra Guard and all of it, but it's keeping them on their toes for a made-up false threat.
[00:49:02.778 --> 00:49:04.379]  Now, it's true if we attack Iran,
[00:49:05.259 --> 00:49:06.540]  They're not going to need to stage attacks.
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:08.701]  The Iranians are going to attack the power stations.
[00:49:09.262 --> 00:49:13.244]  And they've got sleeper teams in the U.S., which is what the globalists want to begin with.
[00:49:13.705 --> 00:49:16.166]  Imagine if there's major system-wide disruptions.
[00:49:17.047 --> 00:49:21.270]  That will absolutely empower homeland security that's just lined up, ready to take over.
[00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:21.630]  Oh yeah.
[00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:26.133]  And we've talked many times about how fragile and vulnerable our power system is.
[00:49:26.173 --> 00:49:31.197]  And so this is something, whether or not you believe this is a false flag, whether or not you believe this is a terrorism event,
[00:49:31.963 --> 00:49:35.264]  The bottom line is that it shows how vulnerable our power system is.
[00:49:35.304 --> 00:49:36.564]  People need to be concerned about that.
[00:49:36.584 --> 00:49:38.065]  They need to take their own precautions.
[00:49:38.125 --> 00:49:40.105]  That's the number one takeaway out of this.
[00:49:40.185 --> 00:49:40.465]  You know what?
[00:49:40.505 --> 00:49:40.885]  Stay there.
[00:49:40.925 --> 00:49:51.128]  I want to come back in the next segment, talk more about that, and then get your take on Rand Paul and others getting hardcore against Obama and where you see all that's going, calling Clinton a sexual predator.
[00:49:51.548 --> 00:49:51.908]  We're good to go.
[00:50:21.408 --> 00:50:22.529]  Absolutely.
[00:50:22.569 --> 00:50:23.930]  We're going to end it Monday.
[00:50:24.271 --> 00:50:26.713]  We usually run it in December into February.
[00:50:26.753 --> 00:50:28.374]  We're already into February.
[00:50:28.494 --> 00:50:29.996]  We're going to end it next week.

[00:51:11.907 --> 00:51:15.408]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:51:15.548 --> 00:51:19.950]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:51:20.130 --> 00:51:26.072]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:51:26.192 --> 00:51:36.976]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[00:51:37.176 --> 00:51:43.498]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:51:43.679 --> 00:52:00.625]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:52:00.965 --> 00:52:06.226]  What if you could shift into a parallel universe right now and be the solution to any problem you're facing?
[00:52:06.346 --> 00:52:11.887]  I'm Matthew David Hurtado, CEO of RNA Drops and author of Misfit to Millions, based on my true life story.
[00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:31.293]  Four years ago, I was dying with PTSD, Lyme's disease, and virtually homeless.
[00:52:32.093 --> 00:52:39.097]  ION and the RNA Drops gave me a new life, new DNA, and the power to become a millionaire in just a few short years.
[00:52:39.837 --> 00:52:41.758]  I want to pay that forward to you.

[00:53:58.550 --> 00:53:58.790]  GoBerkey.com.
[00:54:21.204 --> 00:54:27.646]  I have sworn on the altar of God eternal resistance against every form of tyranny.
[00:54:28.506 --> 00:54:30.206]  I am the resistance.
[00:54:30.366 --> 00:54:31.566]  You are the resistance.
[00:54:31.586 --> 00:54:33.027]  We are Free Humanity.
[00:54:33.067 --> 00:54:40.688]  Broadcasting worldwide from occupied North America into FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas.
[00:54:40.789 --> 00:54:42.529]  This is The Info War.
[00:54:46.792 --> 00:54:47.752]  Here's the bottom line.
[00:54:48.393 --> 00:54:58.816]  The Republican Party was basically taken over by the CIA in the 60s, and National Review and William F. Buckley were part of that, and that's been declassified.
[00:54:59.036 --> 00:55:00.536]  By the way, if you want to look that up, it's public.
[00:55:00.976 --> 00:55:02.937]  Type in National Review, CIA.
[00:55:03.997 --> 00:55:09.139]  Then the neocons, who've been the Trotskyites, literally out of Mexico, from Russia, literally.
[00:55:09.179 --> 00:55:11.319]  This is mainstream news, too, if you're a new listener, and you're like, what?
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:12.020]  Communists?
[00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:12.940]  Took over.
[00:55:13.905 --> 00:55:19.990]  But, their job has always been to suppress the Tea Party, has been to sub... you know, the proto-Tea Party.
[00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:23.973]  People like, with no apologies, Barry Goldwater.
[00:55:24.693 --> 00:55:27.115]  Sometimes silence isn't golden, it's yellow.
[00:55:28.396 --> 00:55:30.358]  And this is all on record if you just want to research it.
[00:55:31.219 --> 00:55:36.683]  I mean, Ronald Reagan spoke out against the CFR, the New World Order, the Trilateral Commission, the PLANDA, until they got him in a room.
[00:55:38.683 --> 00:55:39.504]  And that's all come out.
[00:55:40.366 --> 00:55:42.389]  And so the Democrats are gone.
[00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:46.796]  They are the front line, the tip of the spear of the takeover, the new demographic shift.
[00:55:47.297 --> 00:55:53.166]  The Republicans are going to be a regional group, and that's why they've got them committing suicide right now with the open borders, all the rest of it.
[00:55:53.860 --> 00:56:05.043]  We need to take over the Republican Party, not let it commit suicide, and then have inroads with kind of liberal libertarians, which are forming out there, and helping take over those areas for liberty.
[00:56:05.603 --> 00:56:07.023]  Live and let live, man, but come on.
[00:56:07.583 --> 00:56:13.285]  Don't raise taxes on middle class and tell me it's social engineering for the good when the billionaires are tax-exempt offshore.
[00:56:14.485 --> 00:56:15.125]  I'm tired of it.
[00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:18.602]  And the truth is something nobody can argue with.
[00:56:18.642 --> 00:56:20.263]  Democrat, Republican, I don't care.
[00:56:20.323 --> 00:56:22.324]  Black, white, old, young, gay, straight.
[00:56:22.685 --> 00:56:23.265]  Man, listen.
[00:56:23.725 --> 00:56:24.686]  You can have polka dots.
[00:56:24.806 --> 00:56:26.487]  As long as you love freedom, I like you.
[00:56:27.168 --> 00:56:29.650]  And the liberals are not high ground liberals.
[00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:30.590]  They're authoritarians.
[00:56:30.831 --> 00:56:32.592]  I know it's easy to buy into the corporate fraud.
[00:56:34.514 --> 00:56:36.356]  Of, oh, you're in this group or you're in that group.
[00:56:36.736 --> 00:56:38.918]  Folks, we got a real problem on our hands here.
[00:56:39.158 --> 00:56:40.599]  David Knight, do you agree with me?
[00:56:40.639 --> 00:56:41.440]  I want your take on this.
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:52.189]  How exciting is it to have Rand Paul calling Bill Clinton a sexual predator and a monster, and he should be the Democrats' number one campaign fundraiser, and others calling Obama a criminal and dangerous?
[00:56:52.649 --> 00:56:56.472]  This is what we need, because when people are being bad, the rhetoric has to fit it.
[00:56:56.773 --> 00:57:00.336]  We can't dial it back just because the Democrats are outrageous criminals.
[00:57:00.976 --> 00:57:02.357]  I mean, I think we've got to dial it up.
[00:57:02.377 --> 00:57:05.418]  They're always saying, back off, be nice, that's how you win.
[00:57:05.458 --> 00:57:06.579]  No, that's how we've lost.
[00:57:06.859 --> 00:57:07.940]  We need to get aggressive.
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:10.581]  Our forebears killed people to have freedom.
[00:57:10.601 --> 00:57:12.322]  We're just trying to turn our voices up.
[00:57:12.622 --> 00:57:13.102]  Absolutely.
[00:57:13.463 --> 00:57:18.665]  You know, Ronald Reagan, you mentioned Ronald Reagan, he was a very different candidate than he was a president.
[00:57:18.986 --> 00:57:24.949]  And of course, there were connections with William Casey and George Bush I and the Iran-Contra, all that kind of stuff was happening.
[00:57:25.692 --> 00:57:32.217]  After about six years of this, Ron Paul had enough and he wrote a very scathing resignation letter from the Republican Party.
[00:57:32.537 --> 00:57:33.598]  He spoke out about this.
[00:57:33.958 --> 00:57:35.079]  We need people like that.
[00:57:35.099 --> 00:57:36.500]  I think Rand Paul is the same way.
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:37.681]  I'm hoping he's the same way.
[00:57:37.921 --> 00:57:45.767]  That he will speak out against this stuff instead of just giving them a free pass in the name of being a nice guy and getting along with the system.
[00:57:46.087 --> 00:57:47.448]  I hope that he gets in their face like
[00:57:47.628 --> 00:57:48.168]  Ron Paul did.
[00:57:48.208 --> 00:57:52.131]  Ron Paul resigned, he ran as a libertarian, and he never backed down from those principles.
[00:57:52.171 --> 00:57:55.072]  So, we're hoping that Rand Paul will do the same thing.
[00:57:55.092 --> 00:57:57.494]  This is very encouraging to see him come out this way.
[00:57:57.834 --> 00:57:58.474]  Well, that's right.
[00:57:58.534 --> 00:58:00.996]  I mean, they need to turn up the heat here, and that's what's happening.
[00:58:01.416 --> 00:58:05.418]  And that's why Ted Cruz is on top now in the polls ahead of Rand Paul.
[00:58:05.738 --> 00:58:15.003]  Ted Cruz, globally, I saw a poll, I think it was Gallup two weeks ago, globally, is seen as the second most influential political person after the Pope.
[00:58:15.724 --> 00:58:15.864]  Wow.
[00:58:16.690 --> 00:58:17.290]  Worldwide.
[00:58:17.451 --> 00:58:19.652]  All because he just stood up and said we have a criminal government.
[00:58:20.313 --> 00:58:21.513]  All because he had the will.
[00:58:21.934 --> 00:58:24.375]  Just like people in Eastern Europe spoke out against the Soviets.
[00:58:24.856 --> 00:58:25.576]  Call it out.
[00:58:25.636 --> 00:58:27.197]  The power is in telling the truth.
[00:58:27.718 --> 00:58:29.199]  All you people that show up to the system.
[00:58:30.059 --> 00:58:32.221]  You think you get ahead by being milquetoast.
[00:58:32.281 --> 00:58:32.881]  No, no you don't.
[00:58:32.921 --> 00:58:33.662]  You become a slave.
[00:58:33.702 --> 00:58:33.902]  Go ahead.
[00:58:34.002 --> 00:58:34.783]  The public sees it.
[00:58:35.083 --> 00:58:42.430]  So when Ron Paul gets up and says, you've betrayed all the principles that you ran on, Ronald Reagan, when he says something like that, people have already seen it.
[00:58:42.450 --> 00:58:43.071]  It's pretty obvious.
[00:58:43.091 --> 00:58:43.351]  Back in 60.
[00:58:43.451 --> 00:58:44.672]  I want to hear more from you, David.
[00:58:44.692 --> 00:58:46.033]  We're going to give the phone number up.
[00:58:46.073 --> 00:58:47.875]  It's a ton of news in the next hour.
[00:58:47.895 --> 00:58:48.396]  Stay with us.
[00:58:50.378 --> 00:58:53.801]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:59.716 --> 00:59:04.283]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:59:04.443 --> 00:59:07.407]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:59:07.567 --> 00:59:12.795]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:59:13.136 --> 00:59:14.718]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:59:15.038 --> 00:59:16.379]  We are what we eat.
[00:59:16.679 --> 00:59:21.021]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:59:21.341 --> 00:59:25.344]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:59:25.584 --> 00:59:27.905]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:59:28.125 --> 00:59:34.048]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:00:05.133 --> 01:00:07.918]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:14.622 --> 01:00:15.263]  Big Brother.
[01:00:15.943 --> 01:00:16.964]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:17.705 --> 01:00:18.786]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:19.467 --> 01:00:20.268]  You want answers?
[01:00:21.049 --> 01:00:21.950]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:22.590 --> 01:00:26.214]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:26.775 --> 01:00:30.839]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:37.738 --> 01:00:47.342]  All right, David Knight has been with us talking about the other trying to ram through cyber security internet takeover on the back of some Transformers being precisionly shot.
[01:00:48.083 --> 01:00:48.783]  Precisionly.
[01:00:49.003 --> 01:00:50.684]  Shot with precision, taken out with precision.
[01:00:51.665 --> 01:01:02.310]  And we've got a ton of news in the shower that Bob Barr is going to be popping in for 30-45 minutes, running for Congress to give his take, his inside knowledge on all the things that are unfolding and where he sees the economy going.
[01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:05.971]  The censorship that's happening in the media and so much more.
[01:01:06.011 --> 01:01:11.254]  But David, other points you'd like to add about the state of politics in this country and all the things that are happening?
[01:01:11.894 --> 01:01:23.519]  Well, you were just talking about Ted Cruz and that's one of the things that makes him so powerful is that both he and Rand Paul have been going in and attacking really the front end of where all this tyranny is and that's the executive orders, the NSA.
[01:01:24.279 --> 01:01:25.619]  That's what we're really concerned about.
[01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:32.223]  Rand Paul is attacking Clinton here and he needs to do that because Hillary Clinton is going to be his opponent.
[01:01:32.604 --> 01:01:42.490]  But the things that he's done with the speaking out against drones and assassinations, the stuff that Ted Cruz has come out against, the executive orders and the dictatorship that's there.
[01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:43.911]  That's really important.
[01:01:43.951 --> 01:01:44.932]  People need to see that.
[01:01:44.952 --> 01:01:47.013]  They need to understand where that problem is.
[01:01:47.113 --> 01:01:56.840]  We need people who are going to speak to that issue and hopefully they'll do something about it because we've had a lot of people who have talked about it, even though they're in the minority, they don't really have the power to do anything about it.
[01:01:57.220 --> 01:02:01.203]  I would like to see somebody just offer a bill to impeach Clinton.
[01:02:01.323 --> 01:02:02.824]  Obama is the fourth term of the Clintons.
[01:02:06.647 --> 01:02:07.887]  That's right, that's right.
[01:02:07.907 --> 01:02:10.829]  It's hard to tell the difference even when they go from one party to the other.
[01:02:10.849 --> 01:02:15.370]  Well, I mean, Clinton is raising all the money, she's going to run again, and we cannot get rid of these people.
[01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:15.950]  That's right.
[01:02:16.511 --> 01:02:23.373]  But somebody needs to put out a bill, even if it's not going to fly, even if they can't get it through, they need to stand on the principle.
[01:02:23.433 --> 01:02:26.814]  It's the sort of thing, just like what Ted Cruz came out and he said, he's evil.
[01:02:27.114 --> 01:02:28.375]  They need to make that point.
[01:02:28.415 --> 01:02:30.055]  They need to put up a bill of impeachment.
[01:02:30.095 --> 01:02:34.177]  They need to do everything they can, even if they know that nobody else is going to support them in Congress.
[01:02:35.876 --> 01:02:37.379]  Other stuff that's on the radar.
[01:02:37.399 --> 01:02:38.561]  I know you're doing a lot of research.
[01:02:39.198 --> 01:02:46.883]  Well, just going back to this report that we had, I think it's very significant that they're now talking about this thing that happened nearly a year ago.
[01:02:46.943 --> 01:02:47.824]  They kept it quiet.
[01:02:47.904 --> 01:02:49.165]  They just used it internally.
[01:02:49.605 --> 01:02:59.272]  It clearly looks like it was, like I said before, very carefully done, very professionally executed, very carefully planned, and very, very measured, so that the public didn't know about it.
[01:02:59.312 --> 01:03:06.357]  Now we're hearing about it, and I think when you look at that, you look at the issue of the Olympics here, we are on the razor's edge here.
[01:03:06.537 --> 01:03:10.319]  Liberty is really hanging by a thread, just like our infrastructure is hanging by a thread.
[01:03:10.599 --> 01:03:20.845]  They could pull off some kind of a major event like this, whether it's a major outage of the power grid that they blame on a terrorist attack, or whether it's an actual false flag attack.
[01:03:21.105 --> 01:03:29.890]  Something really big like this, taking the power out, they could use that to further ramp up the police state use as an excuse, even if we have a terrorist attack in the Olympics.
[01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:34.433]  That's something that would be very, very dangerous for us because it would extrapolate that back to here.
[01:03:36.994 --> 01:03:39.137]  What does your gut tell you is going to happen to Obama?
[01:03:39.178 --> 01:03:46.810]  Because if we don't try to impeach him or rebuff what he's done, it's going to set the precedent that all this executive garbage is passed on to the next tyrant.
[01:03:47.324 --> 01:03:53.969]  Yeah, that's exactly why I think a lot of people in the Republican Party are letting him get away with it, because they want that power when they get into office.
[01:03:54.409 --> 01:03:56.270]  We've seen that happen over and over again.
[01:03:56.491 --> 01:03:58.012]  They'll just switch sides.
[01:03:58.132 --> 01:04:05.257]  A lot of people are criticizing him here and there on separate issues, but they really want that same power when they get into office.
[01:04:05.317 --> 01:04:06.898]  They don't really want to take that away.
[01:04:06.998 --> 01:04:08.579]  They could take it away if they wanted to.
[01:04:08.619 --> 01:04:12.342]  We've seen the abuse is so much worse than it ever was under Nixon.
[01:04:12.742 --> 01:04:15.023]  You know, the abuse of the IRS power.
[01:04:15.483 --> 01:04:19.604]  At that time, the IRS commissioner just took the enemies list and put it in his safe.
[01:04:19.724 --> 01:04:20.925]  He didn't actually execute it.
[01:04:20.945 --> 01:04:25.406]  Now we've got IRS commissioners who actually execute the enemies list and actually lie about it.
[01:04:25.426 --> 01:04:26.687]  And then don't get in trouble.
[01:04:26.907 --> 01:04:27.827]  Get caught lying.
[01:04:27.867 --> 01:04:29.668]  It's come out she lied over and over again under oath.
[01:04:29.988 --> 01:04:33.269]  And then they're still expanding the persecution.
[01:04:33.689 --> 01:04:36.830]  There's nothing worse than letting somebody get away with the crime.
[01:04:37.211 --> 01:04:41.853]  Because what the federal government is turning into is the feral government.
[01:04:42.153 --> 01:04:46.075]  This is a government that's been abroad, killing people, starting wars.
[01:04:46.135 --> 01:04:46.995]  Now they're bringing it home.
[01:04:47.015 --> 01:04:47.315]  No, you're right.
[01:04:47.335 --> 01:04:50.657]  They are a feral, rogue, mad dog government.
[01:04:51.317 --> 01:04:55.699]  And all of us are in danger, including the idiots that are in the system, letting this happen.
[01:04:55.719 --> 01:05:00.681]  You think this power is not going to bring everything down, you morons, with no checks and balances?
[01:05:00.701 --> 01:05:01.582]  This is a disaster.
[01:05:02.282 --> 01:05:06.635]  This is a disaster for stability, the world, our wealth, everything.
[01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:07.378]  Thank you, David Knight.
[01:05:07.398 --> 01:05:07.899]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:09.761 --> 01:05:12.342]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:05:12.602 --> 01:05:17.483]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:05:17.743 --> 01:05:25.604]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:05:25.844 --> 01:05:30.165]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:05:30.385 --> 01:05:34.186]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:05:34.346 --> 01:05:40.049]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:05:40.289 --> 01:05:43.070]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:05:43.450 --> 01:05:48.672]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:05:48.833 --> 01:05:56.376]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist.
[01:05:56.716 --> 01:06:06.724]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[01:06:19.835 --> 01:06:26.740]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:31.623]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:06:31.803 --> 01:06:38.467]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:38.587 --> 01:06:45.572]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:06:45.752 --> 01:06:52.638]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:06:52.778 --> 01:06:57.122]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:06:57.262 --> 01:07:06.790]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:09.152]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:09.352 --> 01:07:19.701]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:07:20.041 --> 01:07:21.903]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:07:22.103 --> 01:07:22.784]  Fluoride!
[01:07:22.984 --> 01:07:24.565]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:07:24.905 --> 01:07:31.211]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:07:31.451 --> 01:07:36.256]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:07:36.376 --> 01:07:42.502]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:07:42.702 --> 01:07:44.884]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:07:45.144 --> 01:07:47.747]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:07:48.067 --> 01:07:51.471]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:07:51.571 --> 01:07:54.914]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively
[01:07:55.074 --> 01:07:56.775]  At InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:08:14.625 --> 01:08:15.266]  Big Brother.
[01:08:15.926 --> 01:08:16.967]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:17.708 --> 01:08:18.809]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:20.270]  You want answers?
[01:08:21.051 --> 01:08:21.912]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:22.593 --> 01:08:26.236]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:26.776 --> 01:08:30.860]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:32.742 --> 01:08:37.805]  Former Congressman Bob Barr is set to pop back in, coming up in a little while, in this hour.
[01:08:37.865 --> 01:08:41.847]  Then we'll continue with calls throughout the rest of the hour and the third hour.
[01:08:41.867 --> 01:08:43.028]  We'll have a lot of calls today.
[01:08:43.048 --> 01:08:44.029]  I'll try my best to do that.
[01:08:44.589 --> 01:08:45.710]  There is so much happening.
[01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:51.493]  Rand Paul has come out and said that Bill Clinton should not be the number one fundraiser for the Democrats.
[01:08:51.833 --> 01:08:52.834]  He's a sexual predator.
[01:08:54.093 --> 01:09:08.537]  So they've had Liz Hurley's former boyfriend come out, Tom Sizemore, and say that it was made up that the two had an affair, even though there were all these pictures of Clinton literally wearing royal outfits with her, hanging out with her constantly.
[01:09:08.557 --> 01:09:11.298]  I mean, it was Sharon Stone, all of them, folks.
[01:09:11.338 --> 01:09:12.598]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:09:12.618 --> 01:09:15.739]  Bill Clinton likes the women.
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:21.064]  And the issue here is the sexual harassment, but that got the news.
[01:09:21.144 --> 01:09:25.768]  It was the settling cases of women that said he beat the daylights out of them, bit them, and raped them.
[01:09:26.769 --> 01:09:28.011]  And then he got caught lying about it.
[01:09:28.671 --> 01:09:30.874]  I did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.
[01:09:32.115 --> 01:09:33.536]  How dare you say that?
[01:09:33.957 --> 01:09:35.038]  Do you understand me?
[01:09:35.058 --> 01:09:39.603]  But what about the issue of him keeping half the money for his private jets for his charity?
[01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:45.244]  He claims there's money for little starving kids in Haiti, and Africa, and the Caribbean.
[01:09:45.284 --> 01:09:46.505]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:09:46.965 --> 01:09:49.247]  So now the phone calls are already coming.
[01:09:50.188 --> 01:09:53.391]  I did not have sex with Liz Hurley.
[01:09:53.411 --> 01:09:54.151]  Do you understand that?
[01:09:54.171 --> 01:09:56.313]  I did not do that.
[01:09:56.333 --> 01:09:57.774]  I just want to make that clear right now.
[01:09:58.575 --> 01:09:59.956]  I've never used cocaine either.
[01:09:59.976 --> 01:10:01.617]  I never lied to you.
[01:10:01.637 --> 01:10:03.479]  And naphthene cat is a good deal as well.
[01:10:03.499 --> 01:10:05.841]  I just want to be real clear about all that with you, alright?
[01:10:06.803 --> 01:10:08.444]  Talk about a nightmare situation.
[01:10:08.464 --> 01:10:14.427]  You know, the government wants us to buy our food from the company store, like sharecroppers, where the price is so rigged.
[01:10:15.067 --> 01:10:15.988]  That's what globalism is.
[01:10:16.048 --> 01:10:16.888]  We never get out of debt.
[01:10:18.109 --> 01:10:19.330]  That's what agenda 21 is.
[01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:20.530]  That's what the student loans are.
[01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:21.771]  That's what all of it is.
[01:10:22.371 --> 01:10:23.192]  Government runs it.
[01:10:23.272 --> 01:10:25.613]  It gives you the loans, but then private groups make the profit.
[01:10:26.374 --> 01:10:27.574]  So, guaranteeing their profit.
[01:10:27.614 --> 01:10:31.937]  They socialize the risk, privatize the profit, but only for select insiders.
[01:10:32.297 --> 01:10:34.338]  Fox News, AP, they're all reporting.
[01:10:35.592 --> 01:10:42.877]  Bankers bulk as postal service floats plan for payday loans, digital currency.
[01:10:43.898 --> 01:10:46.580]  So everybody, they got all these U.S.
[01:10:47.801 --> 01:10:54.346]  different laboratories, different universities, John Hopkins, you name it, coming out with their own Bitcoins to challenge it.
[01:10:54.386 --> 01:11:03.033]  And you've got the postal service, who by the way, I've noticed for five years, when we ship stuff to Europe or anywhere else outside the U.S., they're in strategic drawing rights.
[01:11:04.426 --> 01:11:15.554]  Dollars aren't denominated into Euros, or into Rubles, or into Yons, or into Yens, or into Shekels, or into Denar.
[01:11:16.255 --> 01:11:18.597]  They are in SDRs.
[01:11:18.637 --> 01:11:27.843]  That's already the global currency that the IMF, World Bank, Ex-Im Bank, and its private shareholders at the Federal Reserve are able to just issue unlimited trillions.
[01:11:29.164 --> 01:11:30.606]  No wonder they're taking over everything.
[01:11:30.646 --> 01:11:31.846]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[01:11:32.067 --> 01:11:33.528]  The ultimate form of discrimination.
[01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:45.668]  The average person is like obsessive with their sexual preference or race or something, fighting over religion, while economically the globalists basically have diplomatic immunity and can do whatever they want.
[01:11:46.448 --> 01:11:47.689]  So here is the report.
[01:11:48.850 --> 01:11:50.911]  The perpetually struggling U.S.
[01:11:50.971 --> 01:11:54.654]  Postal Service has bankers in a tizzy after floating a plan
[01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:59.071]  You branch into what's called non-bank financial services.
[01:11:59.091 --> 01:12:08.633]  Yeah, you give people those payday loans, the loan-sharking loans that used to be illegal but now are getting pushed, that somehow sound a lot like what lenders do.
[01:12:09.033 --> 01:12:18.955]  In a white paper distributed last month, the Postal Service Inspector General discussed getting into an array of financial services as a means of keeping the money-losing mail operation afloat.
[01:12:20.697 --> 01:12:26.408]  Payday loans, check cashing, and digital currency exchanges were among the possibilities outlined in the January 27 report.
[01:12:26.768 --> 01:12:30.134]  You know, the funny part is, I would actually support
[01:12:31.764 --> 01:12:37.267]  A federal bank, if it gave people very low interest loans, and it didn't use it as a political payoff, and as a new bubble.
[01:12:37.607 --> 01:12:40.149]  But the government's so corrupt, just like with mortgages, they can't be trusted.
[01:12:40.509 --> 01:12:41.950]  Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, all that.
[01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:44.131]  What I am for is state banks.
[01:12:44.931 --> 01:12:57.018]  You should have state competing currencies in the states, a lot of other countries and places have had that, they're very successful, and that can give loans through the state government, through a state bank, for economic development zones.
[01:12:58.178 --> 01:13:01.724]  And that's something a lot better than the Postal Service.
[01:13:01.744 --> 01:13:05.169]  It's basically an arm of the Socialist end of the Democratic Party.
[01:13:05.630 --> 01:13:07.072]  Not a good deal.
[01:13:07.132 --> 01:13:08.314]  So, would the U.S.
[01:13:08.354 --> 01:13:10.557]  Postal Service make a better banker for the poor?
[01:13:11.428 --> 01:13:12.790]  Well, they're already loan sharking the poor.
[01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:14.992]  Man, they've got really stuff that used to be illegal everywhere now.
[01:13:15.312 --> 01:13:17.054]  These payday loans and high interest rates.
[01:13:17.515 --> 01:13:19.337]  Just absolutely atrocious.
[01:13:20.198 --> 01:13:22.360]  What is going on on that front?
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:27.686]  Speaking of finances, Bitcoin plunges as major exchange Mt.
[01:13:27.766 --> 01:13:29.067]  Gox halts all the draws.
[01:13:30.211 --> 01:13:38.074]  I'm all for new digital currencies, and I want independent ones outside of the strategic drawing reserves and rights that are coming out.
[01:13:39.055 --> 01:13:44.357]  But Bitcoin, I don't know, I think the whole thing has been very, very suspect from the beginning.
[01:13:44.377 --> 01:13:45.498]  We don't know the providence of it.
[01:13:45.518 --> 01:13:49.779]  You see government talking about indicting people and going after folks that are involved in it.
[01:13:49.879 --> 01:13:50.860]  I'm just saying watch out.
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.361]  That's all I'm saying on that front.
[01:13:53.721 --> 01:14:10.510]  Now, we've got him for the next 40 minutes or so, and he usually comes on three or four times a year, but I twisted his arm to come back on again, because so much is happening, and his knowledge in government, in Congress, and also as a senior person at the CIA, as a U.S.
[01:14:10.570 --> 01:14:13.312]  attorney before that, I guess after that for Reagan,
[01:14:14.554 --> 01:14:20.555]  He can really cover all the bases and give us his breakdown on a lot of different news items.
[01:14:21.336 --> 01:14:27.437]  And I wanted to get him on last week, but we're able to do it this week, on the open persecution of Dinesh D'Souza.
[01:14:28.097 --> 01:14:29.237]  And I've looked at campaign law.
[01:14:29.277 --> 01:14:30.498]  It's questionable what happened.
[01:14:30.518 --> 01:14:31.458]  He's pled not guilty.
[01:14:31.878 --> 01:14:43.901]  But compared to Obama getting a third of his money from offshore donors completely illegally, not getting in trouble, the stuff Rahm Emanuel does, when this Justice Department that is so suspect
[01:14:44.987 --> 01:15:02.491]  And that has been caught with all the energy scams and Benghazi and Fast and Furious and the revolving doors and just unprecedented election fraud and giving drivers licenses to illegals and letting them vote, the Justice Department defending that.
[01:15:03.111 --> 01:15:06.712]  Everything they've been doing, it makes Nixon look like an angel.
[01:15:07.172 --> 01:15:08.413]  And by the way, he was not an angel.
[01:15:08.653 --> 01:15:09.713]  I'm not a fan of Richard Nixon.
[01:15:10.578 --> 01:15:11.860]  I kind of am compared to Obama.
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:21.253]  I never used to believe in lesser of two evils, but man, the point is he's got a blank check to power grab and a blank check to give billions to his friends and all these fake energy scams.
[01:15:21.593 --> 01:15:25.198]  So to have that Justice Department arresting the governor,
[01:15:26.223 --> 01:15:32.671]  Former governor of Virginia who was getting money to promote a supplement company when he got out.
[01:15:33.552 --> 01:15:39.980]  Normally, because I follow politics for 20 years, 18 years on air, you would normally get an ethics committee investigation and maybe get a slap on the wrist.
[01:15:40.321 --> 01:15:43.285]  What I'm saying is Democrats do stuff light years worse.
[01:15:43.345 --> 01:15:44.907]  It's clearly politically motivated.
[01:15:45.387 --> 01:15:57.738]  And the day that broke, I had Bob Barr on two weeks ago, that Thursday, and six hours later it broke about Dinesh D'Souza, who has movies coming out basically exposing Hillary Clinton this summer and then the next year.
[01:15:58.218 --> 01:15:59.059]  And they're scared of that.
[01:15:59.139 --> 01:16:00.660]  So, I'm not a fan of Chris Christie.
[01:16:00.941 --> 01:16:01.781]  Basically a Democrat.
[01:16:02.122 --> 01:16:06.666]  But because he's in the way of Hillary, they're going after him for a crooked toenail for what some underlings did.
[01:16:06.746 --> 01:16:09.068]  So, this is the Clinton machine, folks.
[01:16:09.668 --> 01:16:10.711]  And I'm so sick of him.
[01:16:10.731 --> 01:16:15.925]  We've got the guy on who was able to start the impeachment and who had the courage on that Thursday.
[01:16:16.809 --> 01:16:26.953]  To say that he would, there's clearly evidence for impeachment if he gets back in, and he's the frontrunner right now, but cross your fingers, you know, don't think that it's in the bag.
[01:16:26.973 --> 01:16:30.074]  He needs to win by a large margin because there's so much election fraud.
[01:16:30.354 --> 01:16:41.819]  Bob Barr, and the reason I've been salivating over this is, with his knowledge, I predict when he gets back into Congress, if you like what Ted Cruz and Rand Paul have been doing, it's going to be explosive.
[01:16:42.864 --> 01:16:45.605]  Because, believe me, it'd be like having Ron Paul back in Congress again.
[01:16:45.665 --> 01:16:51.226]  We need people that know where the bodies are buried and who've been exposing the NSA, all of it.
[01:16:51.246 --> 01:16:52.586]  It was Bob Barr, folks.
[01:16:52.986 --> 01:16:54.666]  So, Bob Barr joins us.
[01:16:54.926 --> 01:17:00.727]  You heard that breakdown, Congressman, about to be back in Congress, hopefully, of the persecution.
[01:17:00.807 --> 01:17:05.548]  You talked about that and warned of that six hours before it happened.
[01:17:05.588 --> 01:17:08.789]  Had you been given inside knowledge or did you just feel that in the wind?
[01:17:10.174 --> 01:17:17.561]  Thanks once again for being on the show to share some ideas with you and your many, many listeners, Alex.
[01:17:18.542 --> 01:17:24.549]  No, I simply know how government operates, and as our founding fathers knew,
[01:17:25.229 --> 01:17:32.834]  The fundamental nature of government and the fundamental task for many of those in government doesn't change over the ages.
[01:17:33.375 --> 01:17:48.625]  Our founders studied societies and they studied governments going back to ancient times all the way up to what was then for them the modern era with the monarchies in Europe and the colonial powers and so forth.
[01:17:49.185 --> 01:17:51.406]  And they knew how government operates.
[01:17:51.486 --> 01:17:56.129]  They knew that left to its own devices, government inevitably becomes corrupt.
[01:17:56.989 --> 01:18:09.135]  And they knew that government after government after government over the ages, over the millennia, will seek to inevitably gain more and more control over the populace.
[01:18:09.175 --> 01:18:13.477]  That is the nature of government, and that is the nature of people in government.
[01:18:14.375 --> 01:18:19.741]  You're parallel to the Nixon years is frighteningly apropos.
[01:18:20.521 --> 01:18:23.184]  Nixon truly believed that he was above the law.
[01:18:24.345 --> 01:18:29.791]  This administration truly believes, this president that is, truly believes that he is above the law.
[01:18:30.571 --> 01:18:32.693]  And even worse than Nixon.
[01:18:33.013 --> 01:18:34.614]  He is proud of that fact.
[01:18:34.694 --> 01:18:46.281]  I mean, this guy takes the will of the House of Representatives and during the State of the Union, basically, figuratively, thumbs his nose at the Congress and the American people and says,
[01:18:46.841 --> 01:18:48.121]  I don't care what the law says.
[01:18:48.141 --> 01:18:50.342]  I don't care what the Constitution says.
[01:18:50.742 --> 01:18:52.382]  I don't care about limited government.
[01:18:52.802 --> 01:18:54.743]  I don't care about the oath of office I took.
[01:18:55.163 --> 01:18:59.703]  I'm going to do what I want because I am the only one that can do it.
[01:19:00.084 --> 01:19:11.766]  I mean, it is outrageous what this president is doing and this new move also to go after conservatives with the might of the government.
[01:19:13.829 --> 01:19:14.030]  Yes.
[01:19:29.868 --> 01:19:30.249]  I think so.
[01:19:45.328 --> 01:19:56.655]  But I'm sure that they're in contact with these various local Democratic government officials in New Jersey to make these ridiculous allegations about him and so forth.
[01:19:56.675 --> 01:20:03.580]  And Republicans need to do something that Republicans normally don't do, and that is to support each other.
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:10.805]  I can't tell you how frustrating it was, Alex, for example, back during the impeachment of Bill Clinton.
[01:20:11.945 --> 01:20:37.086]  When I was virtually alone out there calling for first the impeachment inquiry and then the actual impeachment of the president, when the Clinton administration unloaded its 50 cows against me, gathered information, sent Larry Flint and all these other guys out there against me, I didn't get a single call, a single offer of help from any Republican in the House.
[01:20:38.026 --> 01:20:45.291]  Uh, and Republicans have to learn that when the Democrats go after our people, uh, we need to support them.
[01:20:45.451 --> 01:20:47.332]  Now, that doesn't mean blind support.
[01:20:47.372 --> 01:20:56.078]  That doesn't mean if you have a public official who's a Republican who truly is violating the law, then we do stand for the rule of law and there ought to be a prosecution.
[01:20:56.478 --> 01:21:00.760]  What I'm talking about is when the Democrats go after our people- Well, look at Tom DeLay.
[01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:06.364]  What he did was complete- For partisan political purposes, we need to support them and we haven't done that in the past.
[01:21:06.724 --> 01:21:07.264]  Well, exactly.
[01:21:07.284 --> 01:21:08.425]  I mean, look at Tom DeLay.
[01:21:08.725 --> 01:21:11.006]  Tom DeLay, because, I mean, I follow campaign finance law.
[01:21:11.046 --> 01:21:12.226]  I've followed the news for 20 years.
[01:21:12.546 --> 01:21:33.135]  What he did is 100% normal, completely standard, but they had the corrupt district attorney, on record, that prosecutes conservatives and libertarians all over the state, go after him, and spend millions of dollars, and three trials, and he finally, you know, finally won, but like you said last time, how do you get your name back?
[01:21:33.475 --> 01:21:35.136]  While, meanwhile, the Democrats
[01:21:36.132 --> 01:21:50.952]  Do whatever they want because Republicans will never go after them to the point of Bill Clinton with all the sexual predator stuff, not just sexual harassment, but settling cases of rape and all this, and then he's their number one
[01:21:51.032 --> 01:21:51.372]  Thank you.
[01:22:14.997 --> 01:22:17.738]  Well, I'm glad you mentioned my good friend Tom DeLay.
[01:22:18.558 --> 01:22:24.961]  And I was one of the few people that supported him throughout the persecution that he underwent.
[01:22:24.981 --> 01:22:32.283]  Of course, I was talking to him recently and he said now he's got all sorts of friends that want to help him when he needed them.
[01:22:32.744 --> 01:22:36.165]  But that is a prime example of what they did to Tom DeLay.
[01:22:37.154 --> 01:22:39.316]  And they will do it over and over and over again.
[01:22:39.356 --> 01:22:41.658]  They're doing it to Republicans now.
[01:22:42.459 --> 01:22:46.422]  And we simply, our people, will not stand up.
[01:22:46.843 --> 01:22:56.951]  They allow themselves to be browbeaten, like Hillary Clinton browbeat the committee when she was before them on Benghazi, saying, what difference does it make?
[01:22:57.432 --> 01:22:59.714]  And we see it over and over and over again.
[01:23:00.578 --> 01:23:01.398]  It's disgusting.
[01:23:01.979 --> 01:23:07.302]  And again, if Republicans get into power and they're violent in the Bill of Rights Constitution, I'm going to speak out like you've done.
[01:23:07.642 --> 01:23:26.192]  It's that the Democrats are going for broke because they can see the world's waking up to them, that there's a major libertarian awakening worldwide, that the Financial Times, Pew Research, everyone sees it, for real constitutional ideas, what made America great, what made America have soft power, what made America be respected worldwide.
[01:23:26.452 --> 01:23:28.653]  People are hungry for that, including in government.
[01:23:29.093 --> 01:23:29.594]  Absolutely.
[01:23:29.614 --> 01:23:30.895]  It is absolutely true.
[01:23:30.915 --> 01:23:32.336]  I see it in my race.
[01:23:32.356 --> 01:23:35.359]  I see it in other races going on around the country.
[01:23:35.399 --> 01:23:39.502]  The Democrats are sort of like the old Fabian Society in the UK.
[01:23:54.535 --> 01:23:57.257]  They simply work their way into the bureaucracies.
[01:23:57.277 --> 01:23:58.998]  They're like the United Nations.
[01:23:59.058 --> 01:24:07.904]  They work their way in, and they know that they can outlast their opponents, because their opponents will wear down, will leave office, and so forth.
[01:24:08.324 --> 01:24:09.485]  So they just outlast them.
[01:24:09.545 --> 01:24:10.926]  The Democrats know that.
[01:24:11.406 --> 01:24:14.528]  And they also know, they know how to go for the jugular.
[01:24:15.509 --> 01:24:17.971]  And very few of our people do, Alex.
[01:24:19.192 --> 01:24:24.614]  Now I want to play a clip of Rand Paul, the Senator, soon to be one of your colleagues again.
[01:24:24.634 --> 01:24:34.158]  Again, I don't want to count our chickens, but I want to come back from this break in a minute and talk about the campaign and some of the other issues out there and what you recommend we do about it and strategy.
[01:24:34.558 --> 01:24:37.139]  But Rand Paul is getting more hardcore.
[01:24:37.159 --> 01:24:38.480]  When you're faced with tyranny, say it.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.541]  And he recently said Bill Clinton's a sexual predator.
[01:24:42.521 --> 01:24:53.146]  Uh, and that, uh, we should not be, uh, you know, tolerating him being the Democratic Party's frontman, which is what you would expect Libertarian Republicans to do if they really wanted to win.
[01:24:53.486 --> 01:24:58.388]  They would talk like you're talking, they would talk like Ted Cruz, they would talk like Rand Paul, whose polls go up.
[01:24:59.168 --> 01:25:00.149]  And that's what's even incredible.
[01:25:00.169 --> 01:25:05.513]  These Republicans won't even do the right thing when it will catapult them to success.
[01:25:05.593 --> 01:25:08.995]  It's just, I don't understand the bubble that they're in.
[01:25:09.075 --> 01:25:10.497]  And I want you to explain that to me in a moment.
[01:25:10.517 --> 01:25:14.299]  But first, let's play this Rand Paul clip from C-SPAN last night.
[01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:16.101]  It's up on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:25:16.561 --> 01:25:25.307]  And get Congressman Bob Barr's take on it and his statement on Bill Clinton, who he almost, he got him indicted in the House but not convicted in the Senate.
[01:25:25.788 --> 01:25:27.069]  But let's go to that clip of Rand Paul.
[01:25:27.611 --> 01:25:29.472]  Senator, let me follow up on two final points.
[01:25:29.532 --> 01:25:34.914]  First of all, you made some headlines when you referred to former President Bill Clinton as, quote, a sexual predator.
[01:25:34.954 --> 01:25:40.216]  And one of your colleagues, Senator Claire McCaskill, said that your comments were, in her words, infuriating.
[01:25:40.596 --> 01:25:41.196]  Your reaction?
[01:25:42.737 --> 01:25:48.422]  Senator McCaskill needs to remember what she had to say about Bill Clinton, that she wouldn't want her daughter in the same room with him.
[01:25:48.902 --> 01:25:50.584]  So they can't have it both ways.
[01:25:50.644 --> 01:26:10.220]  The Democrats can't say, oh, we're the great defenders of women's rights in the workplace and we will defend you against some kind of abusive boss that uses their position of authority to take advantage of a young woman, when the leader of their party, the leading fundraiser in the country, is Bill Clinton, who was a perpetrator
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:12.581]  Of that kind of sexual harassment.
[01:26:13.062 --> 01:26:14.783]  You know, so they can't have it both ways.
[01:26:15.043 --> 01:26:22.347]  And so I really think that anybody who wants to take money from Bill Clinton or have a fundraiser has a lot of explaining to do.
[01:26:22.407 --> 01:26:24.209]  In fact, I think they should give the money back.
[01:26:24.289 --> 01:26:27.871]  If they want to take a position on women's rights, by all means do.
[01:26:28.251 --> 01:26:34.815]  But you can't do it and take it from a guy who is using his position of authority to take advantage of young women in the workplace.
[01:26:35.095 --> 01:26:37.217]  I mean, for goodness sakes, he paid an $800,000 fine for sexual harassment.
[01:26:39.138 --> 01:26:39.398]  That's right.
[01:26:39.418 --> 01:26:47.563]  So he admitted to it in one court case, and really, I think, has been convicted in the public place for the other sexual harassment.
[01:26:47.643 --> 01:26:48.883]  So Hillary's coming back.
[01:26:49.123 --> 01:26:51.965]  I mean, for me, this is such a no-brainer.
[01:26:51.985 --> 01:26:56.307]  And I like how the Senator didn't back off when he was attacked as the incredulous reporter.
[01:26:56.327 --> 01:27:00.009]  Like, how dare you say the sky is blue and the sun is yellow?
[01:27:00.289 --> 01:27:01.790]  How dare you say grass is green?
[01:27:02.150 --> 01:27:06.253]  Congresswoman Bob Barr, what is your take on what he said?
[01:27:06.273 --> 01:27:08.534]  And would you like to expand your remarks on that?
[01:27:09.701 --> 01:27:10.442]  Definitely, Alex.
[01:27:10.462 --> 01:27:10.742]  Thank you.
[01:27:10.762 --> 01:27:14.644]  And I had to deal with sort of another aspect of this just this morning.
[01:27:14.704 --> 01:27:29.814]  I was on an MSNBC interview with Chuck Todd, and he was referring back to the impeachment as what the Democrats tried back then to avoid impeachment, and that is, oh, this is just sexual piccadillos.
[01:27:30.935 --> 01:27:37.902]  So they're resurrecting that now to inoculate Clinton, Hillary Clinton, and Bill Clinton once again.
[01:27:37.922 --> 01:27:47.372]  As you know and I know, and I think most Americans realize both at the time, but maybe we need to remind them, Bill Clinton was not impeached for personal behavior.
[01:27:47.432 --> 01:27:52.638]  He was impeached because he violated federal criminal laws on obstruction of justice.
[01:27:53.399 --> 01:27:54.240]  I don't know.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:09.921]  We're good to go.
[01:28:29.349 --> 01:28:30.250]  But a lot of it leaked.
[01:28:30.290 --> 01:28:33.831]  It was biting women, raping them, choking them.
[01:28:33.931 --> 01:28:34.972]  Oh, it was awful.
[01:28:35.932 --> 01:28:44.697]  And yet we were prevented by the Senate from using any of that in the impeachment trial in the Senate.
[01:28:45.537 --> 01:28:47.238]  So there is evidence there.
[01:28:47.278 --> 01:28:55.923]  I mean, it is more than clear, more than beyond a reasonable doubt what this man was and may very well still be.
[01:28:56.641 --> 01:29:05.151]  What do you think people that are just pro-freedom, beyond libertarian, beyond conservative, kind of Thomas Jefferson type liberals, what do you think we should do?
[01:29:05.191 --> 01:29:10.778]  We're going to break and come back with a few minutes on the other side with you on other issues, but what should we do to get back on the offense?
[01:29:11.741 --> 01:29:16.783]  Certainly support some of the people that you just mentioned, like Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.
[01:29:17.423 --> 01:29:23.405]  And we also need to call these issues what they are.
[01:29:23.465 --> 01:29:33.429]  When they are going after people like Chris Christie, go after him on the facts, go after him on his decisions and his votes and so forth, that's fine.
[01:29:33.929 --> 01:29:48.256]  But going after Republicans simply because they're Republicans and simply because they have the backbone and the resources to go after Obama, for example, as Dinesh D'Souza has, we need to support them.
[01:29:48.676 --> 01:29:54.379]  People need to be supporting Dinesh D'Souza the same way a lot of us supported Tom DeLay when he was being persecuted.
[01:29:54.399 --> 01:29:55.320]  That's right, that's right.
[01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:55.840]  Stay there.
[01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:57.541]  Former Congressman Bob Barr, straight ahead.
[01:29:59.079 --> 01:30:02.067]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[01:31:05.376 --> 01:31:07.738]  We're by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:31:07.858 --> 01:31:10.600]  The facts are in.
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:11.901]  The studies are legion.
[01:31:12.182 --> 01:31:19.548]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:31:19.688 --> 01:31:23.151]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:31:23.531 --> 01:31:23.911]  Simple.
[01:31:24.091 --> 01:31:28.415]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:31:28.795 --> 01:31:34.259]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:31:34.519 --> 01:31:50.570]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Live Fluoride Shield formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:31:50.850 --> 01:31:55.053]  Let's take a stand against the globalists by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[01:31:55.413 --> 01:31:57.253]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.

[01:32:03.135 --> 01:32:07.376]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[01:32:07.536 --> 01:32:09.376]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:32:09.596 --> 01:32:15.177]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[01:32:15.377 --> 01:32:22.579]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:32:22.759 --> 01:32:26.002]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:32:26.122 --> 01:32:27.923]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:32:28.163 --> 01:32:32.727]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:32:32.807 --> 01:32:35.549]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[01:32:35.730 --> 01:32:41.254]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[01:32:41.254 --> 01:32:41.714]  We're good.
[01:33:17.737 --> 01:33:18.958]  You got a business.
[01:33:19.138 --> 01:33:20.279]  You didn't build that.
[01:33:21.279 --> 01:33:24.281]  Somebody else made that happen.
[01:33:30.425 --> 01:33:34.627]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:33:35.348 --> 01:33:36.669]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:40.591 --> 01:33:44.173]  Bombard is with us till 45 after.
[01:33:44.193 --> 01:33:46.515]  Then I'm going to cover news the entire
[01:33:50.251 --> 01:33:53.455]  Third hour will be your phone calls and breaking news.
[01:33:53.996 --> 01:33:56.099]  So get ready for me at the end of the hour to give a number out.
[01:33:56.399 --> 01:33:57.821]  Love to hear from you on this Friday edition.
[01:33:58.362 --> 01:34:00.925]  I'll be back Sunday live 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:34:00.985 --> 01:34:04.050]  Central Standard Time with the Sunday broadcast.
[01:34:05.151 --> 01:34:07.413]  So be sure and join us for that.
[01:34:07.774 --> 01:34:12.319]  And please spread the word about the broadcast to your friends and family on Facebook and Twitter.
[01:34:12.339 --> 01:34:22.269]  You can follow us on Facebook and Twitter by going to InfoWars.com and there's links there on the site to the real Alex Jones and our five Facebooks that have three million
[01:34:22.970 --> 01:34:26.874]  Three million likes altogether, one of them almost 800,000 likes.
[01:34:26.994 --> 01:34:31.037]  Our Twitter, I kind of came to Twitter late, that's a quarter million.
[01:34:31.878 --> 01:34:40.666]  And while you're at it, I'm going to retweet out Bob Barr's Facebook and his Twitter as soon as he leaves us today so that you can follow him there as well.
[01:34:41.147 --> 01:34:43.989]  And again, the reason I'm so thankful for Bob Barr is
[01:34:44.997 --> 01:35:08.957]  Back when I was just a local talk show host, he probably doesn't even remember this, in 96, 97, 98, he would come on and talk about Carnivore and the NSA and the dangers of big government and how the Republicans were working with the Democrats to do that, and I would interview Shippers and Farah and all the people that were involved over at WorldNet Daily exposing what was happening.
[01:35:09.597 --> 01:35:14.278]  Man, people got killed, people got threatened, people got... I mean, you think Obama's been bad.
[01:35:14.298 --> 01:35:15.538]  Man, Hillary Clinton gets in.
[01:35:15.598 --> 01:35:16.998]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:35:17.579 --> 01:35:24.240]  And she's so weak, she's so corrupt, she's so bad, it will just... just politically destroy her.
[01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:26.780]  Because they're going to destroy us and we've done nothing.
[01:35:28.001 --> 01:35:32.902]  And they're coming after people and auditing, and the stuff I've been through, it's just, the harassment's been incredible.
[01:35:33.322 --> 01:35:35.082]  And I don't complain about it, I don't even talk about it.
[01:35:36.087 --> 01:35:44.270]  But then Lois Lerner gets caught lying months ago, and then it comes out yesterday she lied again and is up for the persecution, and no one gets in trouble!
[01:35:44.670 --> 01:35:45.870]  The woman should be arrested!
[01:35:46.471 --> 01:35:47.731]  They're ruining people's lives!
[01:35:47.771 --> 01:35:50.712]  And so many others go, well I'm scared, I'll just shut up.
[01:35:50.772 --> 01:35:53.833]  Folks, if you do that, they win, we become a banana republic.
[01:35:53.853 --> 01:35:54.493]  We're very close.
[01:35:55.354 --> 01:36:04.617]  So I wanted to get Bob Barr on to talk about a host of other issues now, and his campaign in Georgia, in such a key area in and around Atlanta.
[01:36:05.868 --> 01:36:12.032]  But before we go any further, and he'll have seniority when he gets back in, to bring up these issues that Ron Paul was bringing up back then.
[01:36:12.072 --> 01:36:12.793]  Nobody else was.
[01:36:13.594 --> 01:36:22.040]  So just like Ron Paul stayed in Congress, so he became so influential, if Bob Barr gets back in, I predict that it'll be like I said another
[01:36:23.092 --> 01:36:27.276]  Another Rand Paul, another Ron Paul, another, but in some cases even better.
[01:36:27.656 --> 01:36:34.702]  That's what's so exciting about this is more good guys there, but I wanted to play this clip from right before the NFL Super Bowl last Sunday.
[01:36:34.722 --> 01:36:42.789]  We were treated to an hour on local Fox broadcast TV all over the country of Obama in a softball interview they called a hardball interview with O'Reilly.
[01:36:43.850 --> 01:36:49.254]  And he said there's not a smidgen of corruption in the IRS, folks.
[01:36:49.934 --> 01:36:50.714]  That is legendary.
[01:36:51.215 --> 01:36:53.816]  The IRS is famously corrupt, persecuting people.
[01:36:54.037 --> 01:37:01.061]  So I wanted to play this clip and get Bob Barr's take on the latest Pinocchio statement from Obama.
[01:37:07.805 --> 01:37:08.786]  You're saying no corruption?
[01:37:09.346 --> 01:37:10.186]  None.
[01:37:10.547 --> 01:37:13.668]  There were some boneheaded decisions out of a local office.
[01:37:13.788 --> 01:37:14.949]  But no mass corruption?
[01:37:15.930 --> 01:37:16.910]  Not even mass corruption.
[01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:18.891]  Not even a smidgen of corruption, I would say.
[01:37:20.532 --> 01:37:29.197]  So, I tell you, that has got to be the most 1984 statement I've heard in my life, topping all the other whopper lies.
[01:37:29.798 --> 01:37:33.340]  Bob Barr, is Obama the greatest liar we've ever seen in office?
[01:37:34.753 --> 01:37:36.054]  I think he is.
[01:37:36.735 --> 01:37:43.304]  At least with Nixon, you could sort of tell when he was lying because he knew that he was lying, I think.
[01:37:44.406 --> 01:37:48.871]  With Obama, he probably could do something that some
[01:37:49.612 --> 01:37:52.294]  Political figures that I prosecuted when I was U.S.
[01:37:52.354 --> 01:38:08.466]  Attorney, for example, a sitting congressman that I prosecuted for perjury, he could pass a lie detector test because in his mind he was so arrogant and so divorced from reality, in his mind, he hadn't done anything wrong because he couldn't do anything wrong.
[01:38:08.486 --> 01:38:13.170]  He was so good and so much better than anybody else and could beat the system.
[01:38:13.770 --> 01:38:14.070]  He did.
[01:38:14.131 --> 01:38:17.173]  He passed a lie detector test that he thought would get him off the hook.
[01:38:17.193 --> 01:38:18.734]  Of course it didn't.
[01:38:18.814 --> 01:38:21.757]  This president is so arrogant.
[01:38:21.837 --> 01:38:28.162]  I have never in my entire life witnessed anybody as arrogant as this president is.
[01:38:28.562 --> 01:38:32.265]  And he truly believes, I think, what he says.
[01:38:32.285 --> 01:38:40.892]  I mean, this is absolute rubbish that there was not, not a, what, what term to use, a smidgen, there's a real
[01:38:41.633 --> 01:38:44.214]  Yeah, it's not a smidgen, it's a giant steaming pile.
[01:38:44.374 --> 01:38:45.415]  Yeah, not a smidgen.
[01:38:45.795 --> 01:38:47.916]  Oh, there were some boneheaded decisions made.
[01:38:48.337 --> 01:38:49.877]  Well, you know, that's great.
[01:38:50.338 --> 01:38:56.841]  If that had been the defense that was around as enunciated by the President of the United States back when I was U.S.
[01:38:56.901 --> 01:38:59.943]  Attorney, you know, we probably couldn't have prosecuted anybody.
[01:39:00.023 --> 01:39:04.605]  All they would have to do is come in and say, oh, you know, I just made a bonehead decision.
[01:39:04.645 --> 01:39:05.926]  I'm sorry, let me off the hook.
[01:39:07.028 --> 01:39:09.909]  Yeah, I mean, I could go rob a bank when the cops show up and I got bags of money.
[01:39:09.969 --> 01:39:11.490]  I go, I just made a boneheaded decision.
[01:39:11.670 --> 01:39:14.611]  Yeah, I robbed the wrong bank at the wrong time.
[01:39:15.071 --> 01:39:18.112]  I tell you, it's insane looking at some other ones here.
[01:39:18.132 --> 01:39:21.533]  I mean, even the mainstream media kind of balked at that one.
[01:39:21.953 --> 01:39:25.074]  What do you make of up closer to Georgia and Virginia?
[01:39:26.014 --> 01:39:34.017]  They're trying to pass a law now because of $5,000 fines for people in rural areas having birthday parties in their backyard.
[01:39:34.417 --> 01:39:35.818]  That's, that's CNS News.
[01:39:36.818 --> 01:39:42.023]  Here's a new one, IRS to issue rules to silence conservative groups, so they're doubling down on that.
[01:39:42.323 --> 01:39:52.011]  And then you're, of course, we'll also get into the latest on the TSA, their own whistleblowers going public saying, of course we grope everybody and don't stop terrorists and laugh at your naked body.
[01:39:52.572 --> 01:40:01.259]  I mean, it just seems like all of the banning lemonade stands all over the country, banning a girl baking cupcakes and selling them.
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:04.082]  What do you think's going on here with this attack?
[01:40:04.602 --> 01:40:08.164]  On any type of entrepreneurship that isn't out of some big corporate store?
[01:40:08.865 --> 01:40:11.286]  Well, that's why they're doing it, for one thing.
[01:40:11.627 --> 01:40:14.728]  The other reason is simply because they can do it.
[01:40:14.909 --> 01:40:18.211]  People let government get away with this nonsense.
[01:40:18.611 --> 01:40:24.635]  They'll complain about it, there'll be a headline, and then people will forget about it, it'll happen again, people will complain about it.
[01:40:25.095 --> 01:40:31.099]  But what you have to do is you have to go after this sort of government intrusion, this abuse of government power,
[01:40:31.759 --> 01:40:34.641]  Relentlessly, constantly, in order to get rid of it.
[01:40:35.102 --> 01:40:40.886]  It's particularly, Alex, distressing that these sorts of things are happening in the Commonwealth of Virginia.
[01:40:40.906 --> 01:40:45.389]  I mean, the real birthplace of our system of government.
[01:40:45.409 --> 01:40:53.955]  I mean, the native home to James Madison and George Washington and Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson and Monroe.
[01:40:54.595 --> 01:41:12.758]  I mean, can you imagine that in the Commonwealth of Virginia that gave us such great founding fathers, now you have police going out and shooting people simply because one of them makes a mistake during the service of a warrant or a subpoena.
[01:41:13.198 --> 01:41:19.279]  You have the government going out and arresting people for simply having a yard sale.
[01:41:19.679 --> 01:41:22.780]  You have police in Fairfax County, Virginia.
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:24.141]  I think so.
[01:41:44.212 --> 01:41:44.512]  Thank you.
[01:41:57.310 --> 01:41:59.591]  Oh yeah, that's all federal guidelines and federal funds.
[01:41:59.611 --> 01:42:05.433]  Here in Austin they go, it was a famous case in Radisson, the guy had three beers over two hours watching a baseball game.
[01:42:05.453 --> 01:42:10.035]  He was a salesman for a big company and he was going back to his room.
[01:42:10.055 --> 01:42:13.976]  He wasn't even, and he told the cops, he goes, they got him.
[01:42:13.996 --> 01:42:16.057]  They go, no, I'm a guest here at the hotel.
[01:42:16.337 --> 01:42:17.418]  They still took him to jail.
[01:42:18.078 --> 01:42:19.399]  And so that's a thing they do here now.
[01:42:19.439 --> 01:42:22.681]  They watch you have three drinks and then arrest you, even if you're walking.
[01:42:23.322 --> 01:42:25.403]  And Congressman, they have signs up in Austin.
[01:42:25.843 --> 01:42:29.826]  I shot video of this on YouTube that says, do not drink and walk.
[01:42:30.567 --> 01:42:33.048]  And then they asked the city, they said, what do you mean, don't walk around with a beer?
[01:42:33.068 --> 01:42:36.671]  And they said, no, don't walk in a bar and drink and then walk out.
[01:42:37.011 --> 01:42:39.573]  We're going to arrest you for walking while you've had a drink.
[01:42:41.054 --> 01:42:45.597]  I mean, if it weren't serious, it would be absolutely hilarious.
[01:42:46.158 --> 01:42:54.383]  But it is serious, Alex, and that's why it's so important that you're out there and that other people are out there raising the alarm on this.
[01:42:54.423 --> 01:42:58.466]  But we have got to do it in a way that Congress normally doesn't.
[01:42:58.666 --> 01:43:03.389]  What Congress, unfortunately, normally does, and the Republicans are terrible about this,
[01:43:04.570 --> 01:43:13.337]  They'll see an issue, they'll define it properly as a problem, they'll have a hearing on it or they'll issue a statement and then they forget about it and move on to something else.
[01:43:13.977 --> 01:43:24.225]  You have to keep after these issues, you have to hold the bureaucrats and the other elected officials feet to the fire, and you have to go after them over and over and over again.
[01:43:24.265 --> 01:43:26.447]  You can't just do it once and forget about it.
[01:43:26.775 --> 01:43:41.241]  I know you've got to go and I want to get some into the campaign here and any other issues that you'd like to raise in closing, but we were talking about political persecution earlier of completely innocent people or folks that have done nothing when it's clearly politically motivated.
[01:43:41.561 --> 01:43:42.842]  What about all the threat fusion?
[01:43:43.422 --> 01:43:51.464]  Documents coming out of the federal government, out of the Obama administration, bad-mouthing libertarians, gun owners, saying returning veterans are the number one threat.
[01:43:52.344 --> 01:44:03.327]  I talked to the police, I see it in the news now, where they're preparing them not to fight radical Islamic groups, but to fight, quote, you know, the Pentagon has plans in Virginia, in the Carolinas.
[01:44:04.207 --> 01:44:09.528]  To take on the quote, Tea Party, that's been in Forbes, you know, the new war, crushing a Tea Party rebellion.
[01:44:10.269 --> 01:44:15.730]  I mean, this is so over the top that we tend to just sit back and I even can't respond to it.
[01:44:15.770 --> 01:44:21.392]  It's so bizarro, but it really is like some bizarre communist takeover or something.
[01:44:22.192 --> 01:44:29.754]  What is your take on that whole move to make law enforcement's main mission now some type of political commissars?
[01:44:31.008 --> 01:44:39.332]  I tell you, there's one example that comes to my mind, Alex, while you were mentioning that, that shows how we can have an impact to fight back.
[01:44:39.492 --> 01:44:41.052]  And I know you remember this.
[01:44:41.072 --> 01:44:43.493]  We might have talked about it on your show a few years ago.
[01:44:43.513 --> 01:44:56.179]  It was about three years ago, I think, when Missouri had on its official state website references in its fusion center, and I forget the name of its fusion center.
[01:44:56.599 --> 01:45:04.364]  But they had references to me, and Ron Paul, and one other individual.
[01:45:04.384 --> 01:45:05.165]  Aaron Russo.
[01:45:06.386 --> 01:45:09.328]  I don't know whether it was him or the fellow down in Florida.
[01:45:09.868 --> 01:45:12.470]  It was the filmmaker who made America Free From Fascism, but yeah.
[01:45:13.007 --> 01:45:20.130]  Okay, but anyway, what they did is they said, basically, on our Fusion site, these are examples of things you have to watch out for.
[01:45:20.231 --> 01:45:22.452]  Ron Paul or Bob Barr bumper stickers.
[01:45:22.872 --> 01:45:27.774]  You know, people carrying the Don't Tread On Me flag and so forth.
[01:45:28.254 --> 01:45:35.898]  And what we did is Ron Paul and I and the other, and again, I apologize, I forget who the other person was.
[01:45:35.998 --> 01:45:37.319]  Oh, Chuck Baldwin, Chuck Baldwin.
[01:45:37.819 --> 01:45:43.700]  However, what we did is we fought back and we got them to remove it from their website.
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:55.523]  So, you know, that's just one little small example that we can, if we do it the right way, and if we don't let them off the hook, we can in fact start stopping this nonsense.
[01:45:55.563 --> 01:46:00.684]  But if we don't fight it, and don't fight it relentlessly at the state level and at the local level,
[01:46:01.204 --> 01:46:10.749]  And at the private citizenry level and at the federal level, it will in fact take hold permanently and become a permanent part of our culture, basically a police state.
[01:46:11.562 --> 01:46:12.042]  Exactly.
[01:46:12.082 --> 01:46:15.464]  There is that attempt to convert us into a classical authoritarianism.
[01:46:15.504 --> 01:46:19.886]  We have to define this march as authoritarianism, not as safety.
[01:46:20.047 --> 01:46:23.809]  And of course, I now remember who the other person was.
[01:46:23.829 --> 01:46:26.390]  It was Chuck Baldwin, presidential candidate.
[01:46:26.670 --> 01:46:27.530]  Yeah, Chuck Baldwin.
[01:46:27.771 --> 01:46:39.277]  But for me, it shows the extremism of the Democrats, who we know wrote that, and Obama's people had that put in from the Southern Poverty Law Center, to put Ron Paul and Bob Barr
[01:46:40.097 --> 01:46:48.363]  In a thing saying they might be, you know, terrorists or connected to terrorism, it really shows they want to politically persecute us and it shows that we're the real opposition.
[01:46:48.724 --> 01:46:52.927]  In closing... No, it's not a joke and it's not hypothetical, Alex.
[01:46:53.007 --> 01:46:54.428]  It is very real what they're doing.
[01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:57.292]  In closing, tell us about the campaign, how it's going.
[01:46:59.093 --> 01:47:00.073]  Tell us about the website.
[01:47:00.574 --> 01:47:03.175]  Well, two examples of how well the campaign is going.
[01:47:03.375 --> 01:47:08.979]  One, just a couple of weeks ago after I was on your show, some of my opponents blasted me for being on your show.
[01:47:09.419 --> 01:47:12.061]  That tells me how well our campaign is going.
[01:47:12.701 --> 01:47:16.522]  Secondly, just yesterday we had America's toughest sheriff here.
[01:47:16.562 --> 01:47:19.503]  Joe Arpaio was in the district campaigning for me.
[01:47:20.563 --> 01:47:29.445]  And Joe Arpaio would not come out here if he didn't believe very strongly how important it is to get Bob Barr back into the Congress.
[01:47:29.485 --> 01:47:34.006]  So we had a very, very great day of events with Sheriff Joe.
[01:47:34.746 --> 01:47:39.630]  The campaign goes well, but as you said just a little bit ago, we cannot take it for granted.
[01:47:39.710 --> 01:47:45.075]  The Dems will come after me, my opponents will come after me, and we need people to support us.
[01:47:45.495 --> 01:47:47.017]  Bob Barr Congress.
[01:47:47.497 --> 01:47:48.298]  It's very simple.
[01:47:48.578 --> 01:47:51.440]  www.barrcongress.com.
[01:47:52.181 --> 01:47:55.203]  And go to our Facebook site and Twitter and so forth.
[01:47:56.284 --> 01:48:00.448]  And anytime I can help you out on the show, just let me know, Alex.
[01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:11.322]  Well thank you and then hopefully we can get a whole other group of constitutional true conservatives in there and you and others can help lead them.
[01:48:12.162 --> 01:48:13.843]  Soon to be congressman again, Bob Barr.
[01:48:13.863 --> 01:48:14.623]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:48:15.083 --> 01:48:15.703]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:48:16.063 --> 01:48:17.223]  All right, there he goes, folks.
[01:48:17.804 --> 01:48:23.625]  Very important interview to get his perspective on things and you notice as a former federal prosecutor, U.S.
[01:48:23.685 --> 01:48:24.025]  attorney,
[01:48:25.504 --> 01:48:42.798]  As former CIA, pretty high level, running major operations, and of course, in Congress for over a decade, Bob Barr is pro-gun, is pro-sovereignty, is pro-Bill of Rights, anti-NSA, back when it was not cool to be so.
[01:48:43.818 --> 01:48:46.040]  And he had the will to try to impeach Bill Clinton.
[01:48:47.841 --> 01:48:49.122]  Believe me, that's very dangerous.
[01:48:49.803 --> 01:48:53.246]  So if you don't admire something like that, there's something wrong with you.
[01:48:54.042 --> 01:48:56.103]  That's why the media demonizes Bob Barr so much.
[01:48:56.503 --> 01:48:58.184]  And I'm not saying he's perfect, nobody's perfect.
[01:48:58.624 --> 01:49:13.931]  The whole issue is, I want to get hundreds of Ron Pauls and Bob Bars and Ted Cruzes, and then even better, then they can go all the way back to a real American system.
[01:49:15.311 --> 01:49:16.472]  I mean, we need Hispanic
[01:49:18.274 --> 01:49:18.894]  Ted Cruz is.
[01:49:19.795 --> 01:49:20.915]  I guess he is Hispanic.
[01:49:21.896 --> 01:49:22.676]  I said that on purpose.
[01:49:23.397 --> 01:49:25.358]  We need black Ron Pauls.
[01:49:25.638 --> 01:49:27.178]  We need, and they're there, folks.
[01:49:27.939 --> 01:49:30.360]  That's why the media says, the Tea Party's racist, don't be part of it.
[01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:32.061]  You're not welcome if you're a minority.
[01:49:32.341 --> 01:49:38.544]  Because they want this racial conversion to flip over, and then the Democrats are back in the news.
[01:49:39.124 --> 01:49:44.207]  You know, black lawmakers, black caucus saying, when Republicans elect blacks, it's because they're figureheads.
[01:49:45.302 --> 01:49:51.286]  When you're elected to Congress or the State House, you're not a figurehead if you use the office like you're supposed to to defend the people.
[01:49:52.587 --> 01:50:01.213]  It's not figurehead when whites went out and elected Obama trying to get rid of racial issues, and of course they made it worse on purpose.
[01:50:02.013 --> 01:50:03.434]  Losing that golden opportunity.
[01:50:04.195 --> 01:50:05.056]  This is what they do.
[01:50:06.318 --> 01:50:13.720]  And I just see how nasty they are, and I see how above the law they are, and how bad they're getting, and it's they've got to be stopped.
[01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:16.700]  And then when the Republicans, you know, try to power grab, we'll go after them.
[01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:19.381]  But, I mean, this is the big battle right now.
[01:50:21.261 --> 01:50:24.242]  By the way, folks, we're going to come back about the number, cover some other news.
[01:50:24.282 --> 01:50:26.842]  Kentucky's setting up checkpoints to see if you've got food in your car.
[01:50:26.982 --> 01:50:28.363]  I'm not, or if you've been eating.
[01:50:28.383 --> 01:50:29.163]  I'm not joking.
[01:50:30.186 --> 01:50:32.948]  So next it'll be, I've got, uh, driving while eating, uh, chips.
[01:50:33.188 --> 01:50:35.389]  Uh, I mean, I eat all the time when I'm driving, but all the time I have to eat.
[01:50:36.329 --> 01:50:36.950]  Doesn't distract me.
[01:50:37.630 --> 01:50:41.492]  Eat a sandwich or something, I don't... Point is, we're gonna be getting into all that, violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[01:50:41.772 --> 01:50:46.035]  Don't forget, this hour is brought to you by mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex.

[01:51:18.688 --> 01:51:20.969]  We'll stop it and most pistol rounds.
[01:51:21.169 --> 01:51:25.931]  TraumaMaxx is a major breakthrough in pistol-rated body armor and prices start at just $170 per insert.
[01:51:27.992 --> 01:51:28.813]  More protection.
[01:51:28.913 --> 01:51:29.934]  More stopping power.
[01:51:30.014 --> 01:51:30.914]  More mobility.

[01:51:46.047 --> 01:51:50.791]  Tell that to the Virginia farmer who was audited by the IRS because of her Tea Party activities.
[01:51:51.391 --> 01:51:56.817]  Or the Texas man who woke up to a SWAT team raid because of online comments he had made about his gun collection.
[01:51:57.078 --> 01:52:00.461]  No, God-fearing Americans like you are in the crosshairs.

[01:53:13.506 --> 01:53:14.906]  But not all silver is equal.
[01:53:15.306 --> 01:53:23.469]  Supernatural silver is an amazing new technology that has been clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloidal or ionic silver.
[01:53:23.829 --> 01:53:30.231]  Supernatural silver resonates at the same frequency as germicidal light used in labs to kill bacteria and viruses.
[01:53:30.611 --> 01:53:34.732]  Supernatural silver is a broad-spectrum microbial that creates no resistance

[01:54:50.094 --> 01:54:52.737]  Tell him that God's gonna cut him down.
[01:54:52.777 --> 01:54:54.178]  I want to get into Kentucky.
[01:54:54.398 --> 01:54:55.679]  Stories up on Infowars.com.
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:00.203]  The police set up eating while driving checkpoints.
[01:55:00.923 --> 01:55:04.086]  We're going to cover that in a moment, get more into it in the next hour and take your calls.

[01:55:26.383 --> 01:55:27.223]  I've got a story here.
[01:55:27.243 --> 01:55:30.425]  Brain implants hold promise of restoring combat memory loss.
[01:55:30.465 --> 01:55:32.946]  See, that's how they're doing all the experimentation publicly.
[01:55:33.206 --> 01:55:34.927]  Oh, we're doing brain implants to help soldiers.
[01:55:35.347 --> 01:55:36.967]  We're putting five-year-olds on Prozac.
[01:55:37.007 --> 01:55:37.728]  It's totally normal.
[01:55:38.668 --> 01:55:41.109]  They just mainline it all how they announce it.
[01:55:41.549 --> 01:55:46.771]  They don't announce it sinisterly, like Martians came to the planet and grabbed troops and put chips in their brains.
[01:55:46.831 --> 01:55:52.094]  No, it's, oh, we're putting chips in to help them after we make them serve seven, eight, nine tours and put them on drugs.
[01:55:52.394 --> 01:55:53.694]  Then we put chips in their brain.
[01:55:53.714 --> 01:55:55.015]  We're going to be talking about that.
[01:55:55.968 --> 01:56:01.269]  Briefly though, ladies and gentlemen, we have added so many incredible items to InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:57:32.759 --> 01:57:49.711]  Instead of searching for actual criminals, without warrants I should add, Kentucky State Police will be on the lookout for people who eat while they drive as part of Operation Raid, which will include checkpoints targeting distracted drivers, despite the fact that eating while driving is not banned in Kentucky.
[01:57:50.674 --> 01:57:52.657]  Well, they can call that eating while you're distracted.
[01:57:52.917 --> 01:57:56.222]  And distracted drivers are a big issue, but it's the Fourth Amendment.
[01:57:56.282 --> 01:58:01.989]  If you see someone doing their makeup while they're driving or whatever, then you can go give them a ticket.
[01:58:02.009 --> 01:58:04.333]  You don't set up a checkpoint and stop everybody.
[01:58:04.513 --> 01:58:05.955]  This is all federal grants to do this.
[01:58:06.135 --> 01:58:07.277]  Let's go out to break with the clip.
[01:58:07.597 --> 01:58:12.082]  To increase driving safety, Kentucky State Police is starting a new safe driving program.
[01:58:12.583 --> 01:58:19.250]  Operation RAID, standing for Remove Aggressive, Impaired, and Distracted Drivers from Kentucky Roadways.
[01:58:19.270 --> 01:58:21.393]  And they show a car crashing to make it legitimate.
[01:58:21.693 --> 01:58:24.957]  Law enforcement will be more visible and the number of checkpoints will increase.
[01:58:25.457 --> 01:58:28.261]  This program will allow each post to identify target areas.
[01:58:29.033 --> 01:58:31.274]  Not only just texting, but any distracted driving.
[01:58:31.294 --> 01:58:32.715]  That includes eating, drinking.
[01:58:33.235 --> 01:58:35.436]  We're going to be out looking for those people.
[01:58:35.617 --> 01:58:40.139]  You're going to see a major force when it comes time for St.
[01:58:40.179 --> 01:58:42.320]  Patrick's Day weekend.
[01:58:43.561 --> 01:58:48.683]  NHTSA studies show two-thirds of all fatal crashes link to a distracted driver.
[01:58:49.989 --> 01:58:50.950]  Checkpoints, no big deal.
[01:58:50.970 --> 01:58:52.471]  We all need them.
[01:58:52.491 --> 01:58:55.373]  This is American as TSA and checkpoints.
[01:58:56.133 --> 01:58:58.315]  As drones and cancer viruses and vaccines.
[01:58:58.355 --> 01:58:59.155]  Not on the rabble pipe.
[01:58:59.596 --> 01:59:02.337]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:59:02.618 --> 01:59:07.461]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:59:07.641 --> 01:59:14.806]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:59:14.946 --> 01:59:20.349]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:59:20.589 --> 01:59:24.211]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[01:59:24.611 --> 01:59:29.133]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:59:29.333 --> 01:59:34.536]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[01:59:34.776 --> 01:59:37.858]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[01:59:38.018 --> 01:59:40.279]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[01:59:40.539 --> 01:59:45.082]  Therosafe, used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[01:59:45.282 --> 01:59:47.743]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[01:59:48.183 --> 01:59:55.207]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at Infowarshop.com and your purchase makes our Infowar possible.
[01:59:55.387 --> 01:59:56.427]  We're getting prepared.
[01:59:56.668 --> 01:59:57.088]  Are you?
[01:59:57.328 --> 01:59:58.108]  Infowarshop.com.
[02:00:03.882 --> 02:00:04.523]  Corruption.
[02:00:04.963 --> 02:00:07.727]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:22.674 --> 02:00:23.694]  There is a war.
[02:00:24.094 --> 02:00:25.015]  It's happening now.
[02:00:25.955 --> 02:00:28.296]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[02:00:28.316 --> 02:00:30.076]  The time to choose sides has come.
[02:00:30.917 --> 02:00:32.397]  We are the resistance.
[02:00:32.797 --> 02:00:35.058]  We are the Infowar.
[02:00:41.220 --> 02:00:47.502]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to have open phones throughout this third and final hour of this Friday transmission.
[02:00:47.522 --> 02:00:50.783]  I will be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:00:51.203 --> 02:00:52.043]  Central Live.
[02:00:53.527 --> 02:00:58.711]  And of course, we'll be back tonight, 7 o'clock Central Time with InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:00:59.272 --> 02:01:02.855]  I've got a ton of news coming up.
[02:01:03.435 --> 02:01:05.957]  Bathroom cameras in Russia.
[02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:09.303]  No, Russia's got its share of Big Brother problems.
[02:01:09.323 --> 02:01:12.706]  I'm going to tie that into Kentucky police set up eating while driving.
[02:01:12.806 --> 02:01:13.387]  Checkpoints!
[02:01:13.467 --> 02:01:13.868]  Illegal?
[02:01:14.488 --> 02:01:15.009]  Checkpoints.
[02:01:15.730 --> 02:01:20.415]  They just put the cop up there announcing the criminal activity like it's no big deal.
[02:01:20.435 --> 02:01:21.216]  We're going to talk about that.
[02:01:21.576 --> 02:01:25.320]  Brain implants, hold promise for restoring combat memory loss, more.
[02:01:26.101 --> 02:01:28.123]  News coming up, but first your phone calls.
[02:01:28.563 --> 02:01:29.804]  Let's talk to Stephen Ohio.
[02:01:29.844 --> 02:01:30.985]  Let's talk about Bob Barr.
[02:01:31.666 --> 02:01:32.046]  Go ahead.
[02:01:32.066 --> 02:01:33.347]  Hello, Alex.
[02:01:33.447 --> 02:01:37.371]  I've been following you since you first came out, bought your first video.
[02:01:37.431 --> 02:01:40.834]  I've been listening ever since you first started on the air.
[02:01:40.974 --> 02:01:42.175]  No, no, you just reminded me.
[02:01:42.856 --> 02:01:44.177]  I said Bob Barr's not perfect.
[02:01:44.237 --> 02:01:47.860]  Under the heat and the pressure of it, he supported the Patriot Act.
[02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:48.961]  Later, he criticized it.
[02:01:48.981 --> 02:01:51.083]  I think that's one reason he left Congress.
[02:01:51.603 --> 02:01:53.645]  Next time he's on, I'll raise the Patriot Act with him.
[02:01:54.614 --> 02:02:02.759]  I would appreciate it if you could try to get my, the man who is running in my district, Congressional District 14 here in the state of Ohio.
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:11.465]  We have a real Liberty candidate who was one of six Liberty candidates, Tea Party candidates, that we managed to get elected.
[02:02:11.885 --> 02:02:14.747]  The Ohio Republican Party was coming after their seat.
[02:02:15.347 --> 02:02:16.208]  He was smart enough
[02:02:16.858 --> 02:02:33.612]  Not to just get the petitions to get back on the ballot for his state representative seat, but he also got the petitions to run for Congress against David Joyce here in Ohio, who was given the ballot position for Steve LaTourette.
[02:02:34.113 --> 02:02:34.853]  Sure, sure.
[02:02:34.873 --> 02:02:37.355]  Just so you know, Bob Barr is a national figure.
[02:02:37.395 --> 02:02:38.676]  He's probably going to get back in.
[02:02:40.035 --> 02:02:42.237]  If he gets support, he'll be more of a libertarian.
[02:02:42.717 --> 02:02:43.898]  I think he's a good guy overall.
[02:02:43.938 --> 02:02:44.959]  He's done a lot of great work.
[02:02:45.459 --> 02:02:49.423]  I agree with you, he's done some things I don't like, and I should have raised that, and I'd forgotten that.
[02:02:49.483 --> 02:02:51.584]  Next time he's on, I'll bring it on.
[02:02:51.604 --> 02:03:00.852]  But if I remember, I brought it up to him before, and he said, well, that was an earlier version, then it got changed, and it was the political pressure, and it's been misused, and now I believe areas of it should be repealed.
[02:03:00.972 --> 02:03:06.136]  In fact, I know he said that, and so that's why I kind of put that to bed in my brain as political.
[02:03:06.916 --> 02:03:07.577]  But here's the deal.
[02:03:07.937 --> 02:03:08.758]  I try to promote
[02:03:09.841 --> 02:03:10.621]  Campaign for Liberty.
[02:03:11.261 --> 02:03:16.383]  I try to promote a lot of people out there politically who are Libertarians.
[02:03:16.803 --> 02:03:20.284]  And I just say support Libertarians running as Republicans in your area.
[02:03:21.284 --> 02:03:22.644]  And talk about how important it is.
[02:03:23.125 --> 02:03:28.126]  The problem is I get besieged by folks that are going to run for Congress or run for State House.
[02:03:28.606 --> 02:03:35.748]  And my problem is if I can't remember what Bob Barr did that made me upset, how do I vet all these people that folks want me to have on?
[02:03:35.988 --> 02:03:38.049]  And then it just becomes a big political drumbeat.
[02:03:38.389 --> 02:03:38.989]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:03:40.362 --> 02:03:47.437]  It did score 100% on the Campaign for Liberty questionnaire, candidate's questionnaire, when he was running for state representative.
[02:03:48.099 --> 02:03:49.141]  And he was forced...
[02:03:49.747 --> 02:03:57.151]  Basically to have to run for Congress against David Joyce because the Republican Party was coming after his seat because he would not toe the party line.
[02:03:57.191 --> 02:03:58.471]  I know, I know, I know.
[02:03:58.611 --> 02:04:04.574]  The RINOs and the Republican leadership are there to absolutely keep people on a short leash.
[02:04:05.054 --> 02:04:07.356]  Look, the Republican establishment's gone after Bob Barr before.
[02:04:07.916 --> 02:04:14.219]  And that's what I'm telling you is they want absolute Boehner type, John Boehner types, you know, who'll go play
[02:04:16.889 --> 02:04:20.131]  Golf or whatever with Obama, or Zombie or whatever his name is.
[02:04:20.191 --> 02:04:20.671]  I'm sick of it.
[02:04:20.691 --> 02:04:21.531]  Good to hear from you, Steve.
[02:04:22.252 --> 02:04:24.913]  It's just, I'm just saying, it would kill the show.
[02:04:26.373 --> 02:04:40.120]  In short order, if I started just having hundreds of candidates on, talking about what they're doing, and this guy and that guy in the state, 95% of our audience, you know, isn't in Ohio, and they don't know what you're talking about is the problem.
[02:04:40.945 --> 02:04:45.026]  So people just need to support those people in their areas.
[02:04:46.227 --> 02:04:52.809]  But, you know, we supported Rand Paul when he ran Ted Cruz against Dewhurst, you know, all of it.
[02:04:53.609 --> 02:04:56.650]  And then as soon as they get in, it's a political fight to even get them on the show.
[02:04:56.670 --> 02:04:58.330]  I don't even need to get them on once they're in.
[02:04:59.231 --> 02:05:01.131]  Our ratings don't go up when I get them on.
[02:05:01.411 --> 02:05:02.972]  I'm trying to get them into office.
[02:05:03.472 --> 02:05:04.913]  That's the reason I'm having them on the show.
[02:05:04.933 --> 02:05:07.733]  I'm sure Bob Barr will come on once he gets elected.
[02:05:07.753 --> 02:05:09.054]  I can get Rand Paul on too.
[02:05:10.072 --> 02:05:19.074]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:05:19.154 --> 02:05:27.396]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:05:27.556 --> 02:05:32.257]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:05:32.437 --> 02:05:36.098]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[02:05:37.318 --> 02:05:38.118]  We're good to go.
[02:06:01.289 --> 02:06:07.435]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great-tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:06:07.595 --> 02:06:09.837]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:10.037 --> 02:06:11.678]  Introducing Pro-1.

[02:06:20.126 --> 02:06:26.089]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilic acid.
[02:06:26.209 --> 02:06:37.194]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[02:06:37.214 --> 02:06:39.895]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates.

[02:06:49.420 --> 02:07:00.688]  Herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[02:07:09.794 --> 02:07:10.635]  The facts are in.
[02:07:10.815 --> 02:07:11.936]  The studies are legion.
[02:07:12.216 --> 02:07:19.540]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[02:07:19.740 --> 02:07:23.203]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[02:07:23.563 --> 02:07:23.963]  Simple.
[02:07:24.143 --> 02:07:28.486]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[02:07:28.846 --> 02:07:34.292]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[02:07:34.572 --> 02:07:50.628]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[02:07:50.908 --> 02:07:52.730]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[02:07:52.850 --> 02:07:55.131]  By blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[02:07:55.471 --> 02:07:57.312]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.

[02:08:03.174 --> 02:08:07.435]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[02:08:07.575 --> 02:08:08.856]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[02:08:22.758 --> 02:08:26.700]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:26.780 --> 02:08:32.682]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:34.002 --> 02:08:48.468]  There have been times... Every time that I look in the mirror... All these lines... All these lines... My whole face... My face in the mirror... The past is gone.
[02:08:49.107 --> 02:08:52.268]  My life went by like dust to dust.
[02:08:52.608 --> 02:08:54.468]  Isn't that the way?
[02:08:54.568 --> 02:09:01.789]  And all my scars and tribulations now are treasure to me.
[02:09:01.889 --> 02:09:03.630]  Yeah, I know.
[02:09:03.710 --> 02:09:04.470]  Nobody knows.
[02:09:21.007 --> 02:09:23.249]  You've got to learn to lose to know how to win.
[02:09:23.289 --> 02:09:24.030]  That's simple, folks.
[02:09:24.070 --> 02:09:30.456]  They don't want you to ever learn how to lose to know how to win.
[02:09:30.476 --> 02:09:32.738]  They don't want you to ever compete.
[02:09:33.318 --> 02:09:34.600]  They want you to live in a cage.
[02:09:37.823 --> 02:09:42.847]  There are more articles out today about how video games are brain damaging children.
[02:09:43.568 --> 02:09:48.992]  And I love how the video game heads will get real aggressive and say, hey, my games aren't a problem.
[02:09:49.012 --> 02:09:51.034]  I can do whatever I want.
[02:09:51.094 --> 02:09:52.275]  I'm like, fine, go ahead.
[02:09:52.395 --> 02:09:53.776]  I do stuff that's bad for me too.
[02:09:54.837 --> 02:09:56.718]  Eat too much, stuff like that.
[02:09:58.460 --> 02:10:01.923]  All I'm telling you is that
[02:10:03.140 --> 02:10:06.163]  If you play video games once a week for fun as a distraction, it's healthy.
[02:10:06.223 --> 02:10:06.884]  Studies show that.
[02:10:07.544 --> 02:10:09.887]  And they've got some games that teach you math and stuff like that.
[02:10:09.907 --> 02:10:10.647]  I let my kids play.
[02:10:11.188 --> 02:10:17.374]  But on average, it's destroying social skills, it's destroying the language, it's rewiring the brain, it's lowering IQ.
[02:10:17.894 --> 02:10:19.336]  It is a fact.
[02:10:21.378 --> 02:10:24.461]  And television does the same thing, if it's not interactive.
[02:10:26.203 --> 02:10:29.045]  When I say interactive, our broadcast is really like a film book.
[02:10:29.345 --> 02:10:31.806]  We have articles, we have documents, we have video feeds.
[02:10:32.226 --> 02:10:39.010]  In radio, you have to image what I'm saying, and that makes neural connections and increases IQ and cognitive function in every study.
[02:10:39.030 --> 02:10:39.410]  Look it up.
[02:10:40.351 --> 02:10:44.033]  Reading, you have to image it all, so that gives you a brain boost, even more than radio.
[02:10:48.027 --> 02:10:50.989]  Spectator television is so weaponized, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:51.369 --> 02:10:52.050]  Here's a new story.
[02:10:52.090 --> 02:10:56.593]  Video game leaves teenagers morally immature, a study reports.
[02:10:57.233 --> 02:11:03.858]  That's just an example, but I just love how video game folks, if they think you're even criticizing it, they get so angry.
[02:11:05.259 --> 02:11:06.199]  They get so mad.
[02:11:07.260 --> 02:11:09.942]  And they go, well, why are you in video games then?
[02:11:10.282 --> 02:11:11.523]  You're in a bunch of them.
[02:11:13.271 --> 02:11:13.791]  Not a bunch.
[02:11:13.831 --> 02:11:15.872]  I think I've done voiceovers for three big video games.
[02:11:16.673 --> 02:11:18.514]  A couple, they just stuck me in them without asking me.
[02:11:19.014 --> 02:11:22.596]  But, look, look, look, the whole point is, sure, put me in all of them, I don't care.
[02:11:23.116 --> 02:11:26.818]  The whole point is, we're trying to take over the culture for liberty.
[02:11:26.858 --> 02:11:29.399]  We're trying to hijack things for liberty.
[02:11:29.799 --> 02:11:34.982]  Speaking of hijacking, Turkey, we're going to your calls, Turkey F-16 scrambled
[02:11:36.428 --> 02:11:37.809]  How do you say the name of that Russian town?
[02:11:37.849 --> 02:11:38.569]  You'd think I'd know it.
[02:11:39.070 --> 02:11:39.530]  Sochi.
[02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:40.250]  Sochi.
[02:11:40.851 --> 02:11:44.673]  Turkey F-16 scrambled to foil Sochi hijack attempt.
[02:11:45.073 --> 02:11:58.202]  AFP reports Turkey scrambled in Gent Friday to force down an airliner from Ukraine after a would-be hijacker on board to Sochi where the Winter Olympics opening ceremony was underway.
[02:11:59.229 --> 02:12:14.233]  Turkish official said, Turkish media reported the Ukrainian man brandishing a detonator, a thermal detonator, tried to gain access to the cockpit of the Airbus A320 aircraft operating by Turkey Pegasus Airlines.
[02:12:14.993 --> 02:12:23.955]  He was overpowered by security forces after the airliner landed at Istanbul's Sabay Gökçen Airport.
[02:12:25.769 --> 02:12:33.954]  A Pegasus Airlines plane with 110 people on board had to land at the airport because a passenger threatened passengers with a bomb.
[02:12:34.875 --> 02:12:41.980]  And it could be a crazy, could be a real extremist, but it's probably a mentally ill, drugged up person that an intelligence agency put on the plane.
[02:12:43.100 --> 02:12:47.343]  And because we know that with the underwear bomber from four or five years ago, that was completely staged.
[02:12:47.663 --> 02:12:48.204]  That came out.
[02:12:49.497 --> 02:12:52.958]  We had eyewitnesses that saw it, but it later broke even in Congress on C-SPAN.
[02:12:54.019 --> 02:13:01.161]  And you've seen the Saudi intelligence saying we're going to bomb and attack the Olympics because you're not letting us have Syria.
[02:13:01.841 --> 02:13:04.062]  I mean, this is really a serious situation.
[02:13:05.242 --> 02:13:15.686]  And they have been hyping up that Russia isn't safe and the Olympics aren't safe to create fear and sell the idea that we've got to live in a police state to be safe, but also to discredit Russia.
[02:13:16.506 --> 02:13:18.147]  And not that Russia needs a lot of help.
[02:13:19.881 --> 02:13:20.881]  It's crediting itself.
[02:13:22.282 --> 02:13:23.963]  Old Soviet habits die hard.
[02:13:24.563 --> 02:13:25.523]  We've adopted them here.
[02:13:25.984 --> 02:13:38.649]  Russian official, CBS Radio reports, threatens that hotel surveillance video records you in the shower and in the toilets.
[02:13:40.329 --> 02:13:43.371]  And they said, so don't try to flood the buildings.
[02:13:44.851 --> 02:13:46.312]  Don't try to leave the water on.
[02:13:47.495 --> 02:13:48.776]  And don't pee on the floor.
[02:13:48.936 --> 02:13:49.737]  I'm not joking.
[02:13:49.777 --> 02:13:50.778]  This is what it actually says.
[02:13:50.798 --> 02:13:52.319]  Because we're watching you.
[02:13:53.240 --> 02:13:58.805]  And did you know for at least 15 years, they have cameras at highway rest stops in the toilets.
[02:13:59.365 --> 02:14:00.266]  Like above the toilets.
[02:14:00.706 --> 02:14:03.429]  And they've gone in public schools the last 15 years all over the place.
[02:14:03.709 --> 02:14:05.931]  And I used to tell people like a local news article about it.
[02:14:06.591 --> 02:14:07.652]  Back before this was well known.
[02:14:07.692 --> 02:14:09.194]  People would go, you crazy liar.
[02:14:09.514 --> 02:14:11.756]  There's not cameras in the bathrooms at high schools.
[02:14:14.141 --> 02:14:15.883]  There's no NSA spying on us.
[02:14:16.243 --> 02:14:17.564]  There's no need to fear.
[02:14:17.644 --> 02:14:18.745]  Big government is here.
[02:14:19.306 --> 02:14:20.507]  You can keep your doctor.
[02:14:20.527 --> 02:14:23.069]  If you have a business, you didn't build that.
[02:14:23.530 --> 02:14:25.972]  It's now underdog slash meets Marvin the Martian.
[02:14:26.833 --> 02:14:28.514]  Maybe that should be the new voice for Obama.
[02:14:29.275 --> 02:14:30.336]  Whenever we're talking about him.
[02:14:32.318 --> 02:14:35.621]  Family of woman who led cops on Capitol car chase suing police.
[02:14:37.216 --> 02:14:40.977]  Yeah, that poor woman ran into a checkpoint, got scared and ran.
[02:14:40.997 --> 02:14:43.798]  She didn't have any reason to run, she only got killed.
[02:14:43.858 --> 02:14:46.038]  I mean, there's nothing to be afraid of, poor lady.
[02:14:49.039 --> 02:14:52.040]  So that's just some of the bizarreness that's going on.
[02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:56.361]  I got a bunch of news, it's really important, but I'm going to go to your calls as promised.
[02:14:56.381 --> 02:14:59.102]  I'm going to try to move to each caller quickly, so get ready.
[02:14:59.122 --> 02:15:00.122]  We're going to go to Mike.
[02:15:00.990 --> 02:15:05.935]  And we're going to go to Lou and Frederico and Mike and Robert.
[02:15:06.075 --> 02:15:08.077]  So start your engines.
[02:15:08.697 --> 02:15:10.319]  Mike in California, you're on the air.
[02:15:10.359 --> 02:15:10.719]  Go ahead.
[02:15:12.180 --> 02:15:13.762]  Alex, brother, thanks for having me.
[02:15:13.802 --> 02:15:14.583]  How you doing today?
[02:15:14.703 --> 02:15:15.303]  I'm good, brother.
[02:15:15.343 --> 02:15:15.844]  Good to talk to you.
[02:15:16.738 --> 02:15:17.398]  You too, brother.
[02:15:17.438 --> 02:15:19.099]  Hey, sippin' on some of that coffee.
[02:15:19.139 --> 02:15:20.760]  You guys gotta go out and get it.
[02:15:20.840 --> 02:15:22.161]  Some of the best stuff I've had.
[02:15:22.621 --> 02:15:24.182]  I look at the Olympics real quick.
[02:15:24.262 --> 02:15:24.782]  It's funny.
[02:15:25.342 --> 02:15:31.345]  All these horror stories, you hear all these journalists come out, flooding with stories from hotels, etc.
[02:15:31.785 --> 02:15:34.446]  And yet, that is where we're moving in this country.
[02:15:34.627 --> 02:15:37.308]  We look over at Russia and say, oh my God, that's horrible.
[02:15:37.668 --> 02:15:42.810]  And whether it's conditions of living, uh, you know, surveillance, that's what we're moving towards.
[02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:45.972]  Lastly, wanted to get your opinion on the attacks on our grid.
[02:15:46.452 --> 02:16:01.032]  Out here in California, I've got a relative with PG&E who says they really just hid the terrorist aspect of that to, again, drum up fear later on, but they check on us with these checkpoints and yet don't watch our power grids.
[02:16:01.092 --> 02:16:02.494]  Want to get your thoughts on that, brother?
[02:16:02.915 --> 02:16:06.178]  Well, the checkpoint is meant to train you where they fully control the population.
[02:16:06.198 --> 02:16:07.138]  There's no Fourth Amendment.
[02:16:07.619 --> 02:16:11.142]  And everyone is a slave until completely destroyed.
[02:16:11.602 --> 02:16:14.424]  Not even guilty until proven innocent.
[02:16:14.965 --> 02:16:16.866]  We're supposed to be innocent until proven guilty.
[02:16:16.906 --> 02:16:18.228]  Now we're guilty until proven innocent.
[02:16:18.508 --> 02:16:20.469]  Now we're just guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty.
[02:16:20.950 --> 02:16:26.855]  And from California to Kentucky, they have all these federally funded checkpoints where we're going to make sure you're not eaten.
[02:16:27.605 --> 02:16:31.986]  We're going to make sure we don't rifle through the vehicle.
[02:16:32.366 --> 02:16:35.086]  Meanwhile, the government's totally run by criminals.
[02:16:35.106 --> 02:16:36.627]  We're overrun just by tyranny.
[02:16:37.727 --> 02:16:42.728]  It's a great point, but yeah, Russia is trying to reform itself and trying to go in the right direction.
[02:16:43.348 --> 02:16:48.529]  Though Putin's had to crack down, and I don't even agree with what he's done, because the West is trying to overthrow his country.
[02:16:50.129 --> 02:16:52.850]  Just like the West is trying to overthrow and destroy Ukraine.
[02:16:53.615 --> 02:16:58.518]  They want to destroy Ukraine because once they've done that, they can come in and buy it up for pennies on the dollar.
[02:16:59.078 --> 02:17:07.062]  That's why these new State Department recordings that were probably recorded by the Russians or somebody, the State Department's freaking out about their phone calls being released.
[02:17:07.082 --> 02:17:14.186]  You know, not only the West has an NSA, folks, and it's the ambassador on the horn with a State Department official.
[02:17:15.146 --> 02:17:17.288]  And the audio is up on InfoWars.com.
[02:17:17.308 --> 02:17:18.809]  There's a bunch of cussing, I'm not going to play it.
[02:17:19.449 --> 02:17:23.573]  And they're like, F Russia, F the EU, you know, just, you know, bring down the country.
[02:17:23.593 --> 02:17:26.515]  And that's what the goal is.
[02:17:26.995 --> 02:17:29.417]  They don't, it's just order out of chaos.
[02:17:29.497 --> 02:17:31.098]  It's destroy everything.
[02:17:32.519 --> 02:17:33.300]  And that's what they do.
[02:17:33.560 --> 02:17:37.063]  Let's go, thank you Mike, let's go to Lou in Pennsylvania.
[02:17:37.103 --> 02:17:39.665]  You're on the air talking about the most beautiful woman.
[02:17:39.985 --> 02:17:40.946]  Her heart is beautiful.
[02:17:42.322 --> 02:17:49.208]  The most wonderful, truth-telling, wholesome woman in the world, Hillary Rodham.
[02:17:49.328 --> 02:17:50.969]  Oh my goodness, make her President Clinton.
[02:17:51.310 --> 02:17:53.812]  And of course, if I don't like Hillary when she runs, it's because I'm against women.
[02:17:54.472 --> 02:17:56.274]  If you don't like Obama, you're against blacks.
[02:17:56.314 --> 02:17:57.695]  It's not that he's a horrible person.
[02:17:58.295 --> 02:17:59.436]  Go ahead, Lou, you're on the air.
[02:17:59.456 --> 02:18:02.058]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[02:18:03.220 --> 02:18:09.703]  I can't imagine how she could possibly be considered a frontrunner for the next presidential election.
[02:18:09.963 --> 02:18:12.064]  I can't imagine that young women like her.
[02:18:12.084 --> 02:18:20.767]  Can you imagine if you were a young woman getting in bed with Janet Reno or somebody like Hillary Clinton?
[02:18:20.787 --> 02:18:24.349]  I mean, I'm sorry to talk like that, but let's just get down to brass tacks.
[02:18:24.429 --> 02:18:25.649]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:18:26.870 --> 02:18:31.592]  Yeah, well, when Vince Foster was killed,
[02:18:33.066 --> 02:18:41.412]  Just, like, immediately, Bill and Hillary came out saying, oh, oh, what a terrible thing, he committed suicide.
[02:18:41.612 --> 02:18:56.181]  And coming to that conclusion, when it seems to me the circumstances were quite suspicious, that at the least they would have some reserve and hold back judgment on how he died, and then to see
[02:18:59.754 --> 02:19:06.176]  See, there's evidence that came out about what was really not a suicide at all within Foster.
[02:19:06.516 --> 02:19:08.817]  Oh, no, Hillary's a nice person.
[02:19:09.677 --> 02:19:10.517]  She never did anything wrong.
[02:19:10.537 --> 02:19:11.478]  She's a nice lady.
[02:19:13.058 --> 02:19:15.039]  What do you think of the Clinton Chronicles?
[02:19:15.059 --> 02:19:18.540]  It's this long, like, documentary.
[02:19:19.180 --> 02:19:19.660]  Oh, yeah, I know.
[02:19:19.780 --> 02:19:20.501]  I used to air it.
[02:19:20.521 --> 02:19:23.722]  I used to air it on Access Television when it first came out, like, in 1996.
[02:19:26.163 --> 02:19:27.624]  And they had a couple more came out of that.
[02:19:27.644 --> 02:19:29.184]  That was Jeremiah Films.
[02:19:29.964 --> 02:19:34.005]  I've interviewed the head of Jeremiah Films many times and he's one of the main witnesses on there.
[02:19:34.025 --> 02:19:36.966]  I've interviewed him so many times, he talks even more like this than me.
[02:19:37.746 --> 02:19:38.226]  What's his name?
[02:19:38.266 --> 02:19:39.287]  It'll pop in my head in a minute.
[02:19:40.947 --> 02:19:46.048]  But yeah, no, it's, it's, no, when you know how bad the Clintons are and then they try to make them like Hollywood stars.
[02:19:46.388 --> 02:19:47.909]  Look how beautiful Hillary is.
[02:19:48.489 --> 02:19:50.089]  Look how wonderful Michelle Obama is.
[02:19:50.530 --> 02:19:51.690]  Michelle Obama looks like a
[02:19:53.536 --> 02:19:54.838]  Snapping turtle or something.
[02:19:54.918 --> 02:19:56.180]  I mean, you know.
[02:19:56.260 --> 02:19:57.943]  As long as she's black, the media will probably say that.
[02:19:57.963 --> 02:19:58.264]  I don't know.
[02:19:58.284 --> 02:19:59.826]  There's a lot of beautiful black women out there.
[02:19:59.946 --> 02:20:02.110]  Beautiful women of every, you know, quote, derivation.
[02:20:02.410 --> 02:20:06.036]  But Michelle Obama looks like a crazy vampire crossed with a snapping turtle.
[02:20:06.056 --> 02:20:08.400]  I mean, Hillary looks like a pile of dog crap.
[02:20:10.928 --> 02:20:17.090]  Ladies and gentlemen, America is more dangerous than ever with nine million property crimes last year.
[02:20:17.510 --> 02:20:19.470]  Crimes are happening every day.

[02:21:13.272 --> 02:21:24.945]  From 1946 to 1989, during a period known as the Cold War, the enemies of freedom sent teams into their own citizens' homes in order to place listening devices and cameras.
[02:21:26.804 --> 02:21:33.827]  They track the movements and personal relationships of anyone they could in order to preserve the power of the state.

[02:24:31.038 --> 02:24:38.785]  You know, they've outlawed dodgeball and so many things across the nation because it, quote, shows aggression.
[02:24:39.185 --> 02:24:52.478]  And I'm not saying this is a good thing, it might be a bad thing, but in the old days, at orphanages and at homes for disabled children, they would take the teenage boys that were aggressive and fighting each other and have weekly boxing matches.
[02:24:53.547 --> 02:24:59.232]  Because they found if you let everybody fight in there, people don't get hurt as bad and they get their energies out.
[02:24:59.332 --> 02:25:00.453]  That's probably what happened here.
[02:25:01.053 --> 02:25:07.038]  CBS News reports Hampton's Group Home Workers allegedly ran Developmentally Disabled Fight Club.
[02:25:09.431 --> 02:25:30.025]  Well, I mean, I know people, and I was just talking to a guy today who has a good friend who's a powerlifting coach, and you know, he has, he runs a school, so, basically, you know, the Down Syndrome group for a big Houston school, he was telling me, for all those kids to go in there and powerlift and all the rest of it, and they got boxing things for them and everything, but now, if you do that, well, you're gonna go to jail.
[02:25:30.325 --> 02:25:37.330]  So, there you go, but then they'll just go out and beat each other to death on the side of the street, instead of in a boxing match.
[02:25:38.894 --> 02:25:46.839]  I remember getting in fights when I was in like an eighth grade, and the coaches would then go and get boxing gloves.
[02:25:46.859 --> 02:25:49.060]  This only happened a few times because that was being phased out then.
[02:25:49.581 --> 02:25:52.562]  And would say, alright, go ahead, after school, go ahead and beat the hell out of each other.
[02:25:53.563 --> 02:25:58.666]  And we weren't mad at each other at the point and ended up being friends, but we ended up punching each other for about 30 minutes.
[02:25:58.706 --> 02:26:02.469]  And now you're going to go run around the field 10 times and then laugh at us.
[02:26:03.609 --> 02:26:05.891]  Just don't do those rites of passage anymore, folks.
[02:26:06.992 --> 02:26:07.973]  And that's what's going on here.
[02:26:08.634 --> 02:26:11.476]  That's one thing if you make prisoners fight, and that's an old tradition.
[02:26:14.319 --> 02:26:19.424]  And some of that's come out in the news, but they can just turn anything into something bad now.
[02:26:19.924 --> 02:26:20.745]  And this might be.
[02:26:21.266 --> 02:26:23.288]  If they're making them do it or something, it's a bad thing.
[02:26:24.048 --> 02:26:25.670]  Let's talk to Mike in New York.
[02:26:26.511 --> 02:26:27.311]  Mike, you're on the air.
[02:26:27.331 --> 02:26:28.052]  Thanks for calling in.
[02:26:28.072 --> 02:26:30.535]  Hey, great to speak with you, Alec.
[02:26:32.483 --> 02:26:37.066]  Uh, you know, you had me cracked up there about Hillary's description of a pile of dog crap.
[02:26:37.546 --> 02:26:45.270]  Maybe it should be the reverse of your, uh, of police issue of the magazine with you on the cover and the little horns in the background.
[02:26:45.590 --> 02:26:47.451]  Maybe she could have a halo on her head.
[02:26:49.238 --> 02:26:49.698]  Exactly.
[02:26:49.718 --> 02:26:53.801]  Well, I mean, I can use childish humor against her because she's already committed every crime.
[02:26:54.041 --> 02:26:56.283]  We can already politically show all the horrible things she's done.
[02:26:56.923 --> 02:26:59.685]  But I'm just sick of her being promoted like a celebrity.
[02:27:00.586 --> 02:27:03.167]  Her and Michelle Obama, I mean, they're two snapping turtles, man.
[02:27:03.708 --> 02:27:06.570]  Two crazy-looking, crazy-eyed-looking ugly women.
[02:27:07.501 --> 02:27:11.104]  And I gotta hear all day about how beautiful and smart they are, and I'm just sick of it.
[02:27:11.684 --> 02:27:18.469]  I mean, they just force-feed us this political class of scum, and then no one is allowed to criticize them in the mainstream media.
[02:27:18.509 --> 02:27:19.090]  They're fired.
[02:27:19.390 --> 02:27:19.870]  I'm done!
[02:27:19.890 --> 02:27:22.612]  I mean, I'm sick of Hillary Clinton in my life.
[02:27:23.333 --> 02:27:23.973]  I'm sick of her.
[02:27:23.993 --> 02:27:24.694]  Aren't you sick of her?
[02:27:25.578 --> 02:27:26.279]  Absolutely.
[02:27:26.379 --> 02:27:29.121]  I could go on with the story, but let me get to my other point.
[02:27:29.141 --> 02:27:30.501]  You just chuckled me so much.
[02:27:31.182 --> 02:27:34.084]  A little astral trivia for yourself and your listeners.
[02:27:34.584 --> 02:27:36.426]  I think today was the first time I heard you.
[02:27:36.446 --> 02:27:38.547]  You're going to turn 4-0 next Tuesday.
[02:27:39.568 --> 02:27:43.430]  Who do you share that birthday with, month and day?
[02:27:45.011 --> 02:27:47.033]  One of your great mentors and mine as well.
[02:27:47.893 --> 02:27:49.755]  I know Burt Reynolds has the same birthday.
[02:27:50.475 --> 02:27:50.815]  Really?
[02:27:51.576 --> 02:27:52.797]  Try George Washington.
[02:27:53.858 --> 02:27:54.779]  You know, I think he does.
[02:27:55.019 --> 02:27:56.821]  Guys, look up George Washington the day he was born.
[02:27:58.842 --> 02:27:59.623]  Lincoln's the day after.
[02:27:59.683 --> 02:28:01.024]  I have George Washington's birthday.
[02:28:01.044 --> 02:28:01.624]  That's really cool.
[02:28:02.345 --> 02:28:03.666]  Yeah, it's really cool.
[02:28:03.846 --> 02:28:04.847]  I like George Washington.
[02:28:05.828 --> 02:28:06.488]  Absolutely.
[02:28:07.209 --> 02:28:09.470]  Let me get into my main story.
[02:28:10.491 --> 02:28:19.138]  I've been on disability since cancer surgery last spring, and I've been in business for 35 years and got nothing to show for it.
[02:28:20.395 --> 02:28:26.600]  Uh, but to what I've relied on is the basic SNAP programs and the HEAP benefits and so on and so forth.
[02:28:27.280 --> 02:28:36.347]  So we've recently had the, after the elections, a change in county executives, which was a different party until he brings all his cronies in.
[02:28:36.907 --> 02:28:40.349]  We got a temporary acting social service commissioner.
[02:28:41.330 --> 02:28:49.396]  And, uh, I filed online for my recertification, which is required every six months, biannually, for the SNAP program.
[02:28:50.357 --> 02:29:05.682]  And I got a call from a vocal interview over the phone, and to make a long story short, what they're telling me now is that if only I pay my expenses like property and school taxes, are they recognized?
[02:29:06.562 --> 02:29:20.511]  So I contacted my newly elected congressman, which by the way, Sean Patrick Maloney, is only the second homosexual gay in Congress to get married, or to be married.
[02:29:20.832 --> 02:29:25.114]  I want to know what you think of Cuomo saying if you're pro-life or pro-gun, get out of the state.
[02:29:25.415 --> 02:29:33.240]  That is an outrageous, impeachable statement to tell people, get out of the state if you don't agree with you, by this chief law enforcement officer.
[02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:34.541]  It's pretty outrageous.
[02:29:34.801 --> 02:29:36.102]  Good to hear from you, very interesting.
[02:29:36.662 --> 02:29:38.623]  By the way, they were just looking at who I share birthdays with.
[02:29:38.703 --> 02:29:40.643]  Sarah Palin, Thomas Edison.
[02:29:41.523 --> 02:29:44.044]  Uh, this is bizarre.
[02:29:44.104 --> 02:29:45.905]  So, uh, I mean, I never talk about my birthday.
[02:29:46.165 --> 02:29:48.125]  Everybody says I gotta do something big for my birthday.
[02:29:49.586 --> 02:29:51.026]  You know, I wanna just spend it with my children.
[02:29:51.946 --> 02:29:53.247]  I think that's what I'm gonna do on my birthday.
[02:29:54.507 --> 02:29:55.407]  Who knows, folks.
[02:29:55.807 --> 02:29:57.408]  We'll be right back with more news, more calls.
[02:29:57.428 --> 02:29:57.808]  Stay with us.
[02:29:58.945 --> 02:29:59.827]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.328 --> 02:30:01.931]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:01.951 --> 02:30:05.539]  Alex Jones and the CNN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.608 --> 02:30:12.190]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:30:12.451 --> 02:30:17.315]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:30:17.575 --> 02:30:25.462]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:30:25.702 --> 02:30:30.026]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:30:30.247 --> 02:30:34.050]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:30:34.190 --> 02:30:39.892]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:30:40.132 --> 02:30:42.912]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:30:43.292 --> 02:30:48.514]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[02:31:09.205 --> 02:31:13.809]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care?
[02:31:13.929 --> 02:31:16.271]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on
[02:31:16.371 --> 02:31:22.274]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:31:22.594 --> 02:31:24.255]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:31:24.536 --> 02:31:25.856]  We are what we eat.
[02:31:26.176 --> 02:31:30.519]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:31:30.839 --> 02:31:34.821]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:31:35.061 --> 02:31:37.403]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:31:37.623 --> 02:31:43.526]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:32:09.096 --> 02:32:19.463]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:32:19.763 --> 02:32:21.624]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:32:21.825 --> 02:32:22.525]  Fluoride!
[02:32:22.725 --> 02:32:24.987]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:32:25.147 --> 02:32:30.951]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:32:31.211 --> 02:32:35.994]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[02:32:36.134 --> 02:32:37.135]  Reports documented.
[02:32:38.916 --> 02:32:39.396]  We're good.
[02:33:09.838 --> 02:33:11.119]  You got it.
[02:33:11.519 --> 02:33:15.562]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:33:15.602 --> 02:33:16.262]  FEMA Region 6.
[02:33:16.763 --> 02:33:18.844]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:21.125 --> 02:33:22.967]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:23.127 --> 02:33:26.749]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[02:33:28.817 --> 02:33:30.979]  Roosevelt was born on February 11th.
[02:33:31.359 --> 02:33:34.301]  General Rommel, the Desert Fox, was born on February 11th.
[02:33:34.982 --> 02:33:36.703]  Jennifer Aniston was born on February 11th.
[02:33:37.083 --> 02:33:39.485]  Kelly Rowland, the singer, born on February 11th.
[02:33:39.885 --> 02:33:41.066]  Now this is the really weird one.
[02:33:42.127 --> 02:33:45.770]  That's not Sheryl Crow or Thomas Edison or Burt Reynolds or Sarah Palin.
[02:33:46.370 --> 02:33:52.815]  Alex Jones, the BBC... One of the top shows on the BBC the last five years.
[02:33:53.536 --> 02:33:55.437]  Alex Jones, 39, of Wales.
[02:33:55.477 --> 02:33:56.318]  She speaks Gaelic.
[02:33:58.331 --> 02:34:01.677]  I was on her show, but they did it taped, so I wasn't on with her.
[02:34:04.944 --> 02:34:07.566]  And I, look, I want Alex Jones on the show.
[02:34:07.586 --> 02:34:11.450]  She was born the same day as the same name, and I've looked her up.
[02:34:12.270 --> 02:34:14.412]  She's from Wales, her first language is like Gaelic.
[02:34:15.393 --> 02:34:22.039]  She can speak Welsh, and she also speaks English, and she's, you know, a big TV star over there.
[02:34:22.059 --> 02:34:24.241]  She's on Dancing with the Stars and all that stuff too.
[02:34:24.521 --> 02:34:28.064]  The point is, is this woman was born on the same day in England.
[02:34:28.685 --> 02:34:29.665]  I was born in Dallas.
[02:34:30.086 --> 02:34:32.047]  She has the same name, and she's in media.
[02:34:32.944 --> 02:34:35.765]  That's why if you Google Alex Jones and click images, half of them are her.
[02:34:36.245 --> 02:34:39.106]  How crazy is that?
[02:34:39.746 --> 02:34:42.406]  Let's search Alex Jones and put her up.
[02:34:43.407 --> 02:34:44.287]  Let's see.
[02:34:45.607 --> 02:34:47.047]  There's a bunch of people born on that date.
[02:34:47.147 --> 02:34:48.068]  Leslie Nielsen?
[02:34:48.848 --> 02:34:49.828]  Now that's really cool.
[02:34:50.348 --> 02:34:52.369]  The guy from Forbidden Planet.
[02:34:55.890 --> 02:34:57.130]  So many other people.
[02:34:57.170 --> 02:34:59.591]  I'm not going to go over all these folks born on February 11th.
[02:35:00.471 --> 02:35:01.071]  Oh my gosh.
[02:35:02.247 --> 02:35:03.429]  Zsa Zsa Gabor?
[02:35:03.449 --> 02:35:05.752]  This is really getting weird.
[02:35:05.792 --> 02:35:08.175]  Oh, and there's all these new people.
[02:35:08.215 --> 02:35:09.497]  I don't know who all these people are.
[02:35:11.880 --> 02:35:14.003]  Very, very bizarre.
[02:35:15.905 --> 02:35:18.249]  That Lloyd Benson?
[02:35:20.256 --> 02:35:25.661]  Oh yeah, Jeb Bush, don't forget that, Jeb Bush shares my birthday.
[02:35:26.461 --> 02:35:28.723]  That is not the most flattering photo of Alex Jones you've found.
[02:35:29.504 --> 02:35:31.446]  Type Alex Jones into Google and show how it's me and her.
[02:35:31.466 --> 02:35:31.906]  It's interesting.
[02:35:32.166 --> 02:35:37.051]  Look, I don't usually cover mindless factoids, but I guess my 40th birthday is kind of a big deal.
[02:35:40.093 --> 02:35:41.334]  I'm not even worried about becoming 40.
[02:35:41.775 --> 02:35:43.436]  It's just like life goes by.
[02:35:43.456 --> 02:35:46.779]  It seems like yesterday was my mother's 40th birthday party in Dallas, Texas.
[02:35:46.819 --> 02:35:47.720]  I remember that birthday party.
[02:35:48.831 --> 02:35:56.219]  Because I was a teenager by then, and when they had parties, they wouldn't notice if I ran off with a six-pack of beer with my friends down to the golf course to drink it.
[02:35:57.721 --> 02:36:03.727]  And, uh... Oh, I think I was like 14 when my mom was 40.
[02:36:05.009 --> 02:36:05.469]  I don't know.
[02:36:05.770 --> 02:36:08.593]  It's just crazy how life goes by.
[02:36:09.119 --> 02:36:13.701]  Ok, I got a bunch of news I need to get to, but first let's go to your calls as promised.
[02:36:13.721 --> 02:36:16.202]  800-259-9231.
[02:36:16.983 --> 02:36:20.444]  Let's move quickly now, because the callers are all great, but they're kind of telling long-winded stories here.
[02:36:20.785 --> 02:36:22.966]  Just give me your point, give me your question, and we'll go to the next person.
[02:36:23.366 --> 02:36:25.527]  Robert, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:36:25.547 --> 02:36:26.547]  Go ahead, from Florida.
[02:36:27.768 --> 02:36:29.409]  Hey Alex, a real honor to be here.
[02:36:30.049 --> 02:36:32.050]  I've been listening to you for about five or six years.
[02:36:32.110 --> 02:36:33.271]  I pretty much support you.
[02:36:33.291 --> 02:36:33.851]  I buy your stuff.
[02:36:34.269 --> 02:36:35.771]  I spread the word the best I can.
[02:36:35.811 --> 02:36:38.493]  I just got two points I want to make real quick.
[02:36:38.533 --> 02:36:49.564]  Yesterday, concerning the subway issue, I was in a restaurant and I came upon some gentlemen that were ordering stuff and I found a little USA Today clip that they had.
[02:36:49.604 --> 02:36:51.666]  Not a big article, but a little tiny thing nevertheless.
[02:36:52.467 --> 02:36:54.968]  And I had a printout of the thing that the food they put on.
[02:36:55.308 --> 02:36:58.630]  And I said, by the way, you know, this is what's in the bread, you know, make a long story short here.
[02:36:58.650 --> 02:37:01.691]  And I said, Oh, well, it's not going to kill me today.
[02:37:02.071 --> 02:37:05.673]  As a matter of fact, not only am I going to get one sandwich, but I'm going to get to sandwich.
[02:37:05.753 --> 02:37:09.174]  And he went and ordered two sandwiches and doubled up on bacon and everything.
[02:37:09.234 --> 02:37:11.215]  And then just to further throw the pot in the fire.
[02:37:11.756 --> 02:37:15.237]  He says, Oh, I suppose you don't want to use my cell phone too, because it's killing me.
[02:37:15.297 --> 02:37:16.938]  And he made a call and put it up to his ear.
[02:37:16.978 --> 02:37:17.698]  Oh, no, look at it.
[02:37:17.758 --> 02:37:18.579]  It's radiating me.
[02:37:18.939 --> 02:37:19.559]  People like that.
[02:37:20.475 --> 02:37:29.358]  Well, they're invincibly ignorant, and they wear their apathetic behavior like a shield, and they think you're weird trying to warn them.
[02:37:29.618 --> 02:37:36.261]  But I'll guarantee you, when that guy's getting chemotherapy, crawling around, you know, crapping his liver out or whatever, he's not going to be happy.
[02:37:36.321 --> 02:37:40.322]  And it's the people that don't care, and none of us are perfect.
[02:37:42.163 --> 02:37:47.285]  And, you know, if you've lost your wife or your husband, and you're depressed, you're old, and you want to go drink a bottle of Jack Daniels every night, knock yourself out.
[02:37:48.371 --> 02:37:49.251]  And, you know, kill yourself.
[02:37:49.271 --> 02:38:03.256]  But the point is, is that these average people, but then they want to put cell towers on top of schools, and they want us to eat GMO, and they don't want us to be able to label it, and they don't... We need to be able to go into a subway and get something that doesn't have plastic in it.
[02:38:04.136 --> 02:38:06.037]  They're like, well, that's their choice to put plastic in it.
[02:38:06.257 --> 02:38:06.717]  No, it's not.
[02:38:06.757 --> 02:38:08.317]  It's illegal all over the world.
[02:38:09.758 --> 02:38:10.078]  You know?
[02:38:10.098 --> 02:38:13.739]  I mean, I can't find gum that doesn't have aspartame in it.
[02:38:15.367 --> 02:38:19.028]  And it makes you go blind, and then they gotta pay for it with the healthcare system going bankrupt.
[02:38:19.288 --> 02:38:20.209]  These people are idiots!
[02:38:21.809 --> 02:38:23.570]  So if you wanna smoke cigarettes, smoke them!
[02:38:24.910 --> 02:38:30.572]  But don't... all the cell phones and the rest of it, great points, is I have a right to tell you it's bad.
[02:38:30.612 --> 02:38:31.052]  Anything else?
[02:38:32.533 --> 02:38:33.833]  Uh, yes, also, uh...
[02:38:34.586 --> 02:38:38.629]  Uh, I don't forgot my train of thought, but I pretty much agree with a lot of stuff you say.
[02:38:38.649 --> 02:38:44.274]  But, you know, we're usually not trying to warn people, not only about that, but you know, smart meetings, surveillance, the stuff.
[02:38:44.334 --> 02:38:46.215]  Oh, I got nothing to hide type of attitude.
[02:38:47.836 --> 02:38:56.143]  And my last thing is, you know, I know you're pretty much not anti-police and, but when I see all these videos and I hear all this, I'm at the point now when I see a cop,
[02:38:56.964 --> 02:38:58.385]  I just look at him in total disgust.
[02:38:58.725 --> 02:39:03.606]  Maybe you can point me in the right direction here, because I tell you what, I will not tolerate a checkpoint.
[02:39:03.706 --> 02:39:05.067]  I will not tolerate being harassed.
[02:39:05.247 --> 02:39:06.707]  I will fight back.
[02:39:06.788 --> 02:39:12.189]  Now, I know that's not the mentality you're advertising for, and I know I'm not saying that you are, but that's just how I feel, mate.
[02:39:12.229 --> 02:39:14.810]  Can you tell me, am I wrong in that thinking?
[02:39:14.830 --> 02:39:17.331]  Because I'm at the point to where I'm just not going to take it.
[02:39:17.391 --> 02:39:18.131]  I will not submit.
[02:39:18.492 --> 02:39:19.872]  I hear you, Robert, and God bless you.
[02:39:19.912 --> 02:39:21.533]  Well, our forebearers wouldn't put up with this.
[02:39:23.153 --> 02:39:25.234]  They didn't offensively go out and look for trouble.
[02:39:26.112 --> 02:39:26.712]  Here's the deal.
[02:39:26.872 --> 02:39:28.893]  We're in a rock and a hard place here, between that.
[02:39:29.453 --> 02:39:35.716]  Because the globalists are federalizing and twisting the police and brainwashing them and slowly turning them into these mindless enforcers.
[02:39:36.436 --> 02:39:46.860]  Then they go out and confront the public, the public gets sick of it, and the public starts hating the police, which only drives the police more into the thick, black ski mask, armored vehicle line.
[02:39:47.121 --> 02:39:50.522]  Not the thin blue line, but the thin Homeland Security fire and takeover line.
[02:39:51.837 --> 02:39:59.625]  That drives them into the hands of that system instead of us engaging the police and with positive reinforcement.
[02:39:59.645 --> 02:40:06.853]  You know, the new magazine that's available in bulk at cost has a lot of good stories about good cops and it has stories about bad cops.
[02:40:07.313 --> 02:40:10.777]  We explain why the cops are becoming bad and there's always been problems.
[02:40:10.817 --> 02:40:11.117]  I mean, look,
[02:40:12.062 --> 02:40:16.124]  You gotta have civil magistrates, you gotta have some courts, you gotta have some type of system for contracting.
[02:40:16.665 --> 02:40:21.527]  I believe in a very small government, but humans have not shown that we can live without government or laws.
[02:40:22.308 --> 02:40:29.272]  But we go through cycles where the police and the government always become above the law, become the law, and then you get a tyranny, then things fall apart.
[02:40:30.472 --> 02:40:31.653]  And that's where we're going right now.
[02:40:31.793 --> 02:40:36.776]  The police on average are not the problem, it's the government on top of it and what's happening.
[02:40:37.765 --> 02:40:41.228]  Most police that I run into are good people all over the country.
[02:40:41.868 --> 02:40:43.069]  I mean, we had idiot neighbors.
[02:40:44.070 --> 02:40:46.992]  When I was over at my parents' two weeks ago, I told this story like ten times already.
[02:40:47.012 --> 02:40:54.337]  I think I've told it three times, but it's just so shocking that, you know, it's a cold night out, the hot tub's on, my parents have a big pool, so we're over there.
[02:40:54.357 --> 02:40:55.238]  We're over there for dinner.
[02:40:56.957 --> 02:41:05.063]  And they're jumping in the heated pool and in the big hot tub back and forth, and they had water guns filling them up at the water hose with, you know, water that was probably 50 degrees.
[02:41:06.004 --> 02:41:09.586]  And they were shooting it at each other, having the time of their lives, screaming and yelling in the hot tub.
[02:41:10.567 --> 02:41:16.711]  As opposed to getting in the hot tub, you know, have you ever been to a resort when it's snowing in Colorado and you get in the hot tub and then get out and roll in the snow?
[02:41:16.731 --> 02:41:17.271]  I mean, it's awesome.
[02:41:17.552 --> 02:41:18.132]  They weren't doing that.
[02:41:18.172 --> 02:41:19.453]  They were spraying each other with cold water.
[02:41:20.073 --> 02:41:24.897]  And they were screaming and laughing in between it and running around in the yard.
[02:41:26.631 --> 02:41:32.973]  And the neighbor, right down at the corner, who calls the police on everybody around there constantly.
[02:41:32.993 --> 02:41:38.894]  I don't want to get in.
[02:41:38.914 --> 02:41:40.654]  I started thinking all the stuff that person's done.
[02:41:40.674 --> 02:41:43.115]  The point is, they call the cops.
[02:41:44.215 --> 02:41:47.176]  And the cops show up 45 minutes, an hour later.
[02:41:47.676 --> 02:41:52.077]  And by then we've gone in and eaten dinner and we're sitting around and bang, bang, bang.
[02:41:53.035 --> 02:41:54.696]  And then, uh, what's going on?
[02:41:54.857 --> 02:41:57.198]  Oh, they were, they were sorry to the water guns in the pool.
[02:41:57.639 --> 02:41:57.759]  Okay.
[02:41:57.799 --> 02:41:58.740]  This looks like a fun place.
[02:41:58.820 --> 02:41:59.060]  All right.
[02:41:59.080 --> 02:41:59.480]  Sorry.
[02:41:59.600 --> 02:42:01.842]  Uh, so you're, you're, you're Dr. Jones.
[02:42:01.902 --> 02:42:02.163]  Okay.
[02:42:02.183 --> 02:42:02.463]  All right.
[02:42:02.483 --> 02:42:03.063]  Well, have a good one.
[02:42:04.725 --> 02:42:17.856]  But I've had my alarm go off one time when I was coming home back when I still lived in town and the alarm goes off.
[02:42:17.936 --> 02:42:19.177]  I don't get it off on time.
[02:42:21.124 --> 02:42:22.345]  No, I didn't get home that time.
[02:42:22.365 --> 02:42:23.445]  That was another time the cops came.
[02:42:24.045 --> 02:42:31.308]  Something was banging the windows and made one of the, a tree was banging in the wind and made the police come.
[02:42:31.328 --> 02:42:32.109]  So I go turn it off.
[02:42:32.569 --> 02:42:36.671]  The cops show up and I'm in shorts, not underwear, shorts.
[02:42:37.831 --> 02:42:38.832]  But I got my shirt off.
[02:42:39.772 --> 02:42:41.673]  I go down and both the cops know who I am.
[02:42:41.693 --> 02:42:42.073]  You can tell.
[02:42:42.093 --> 02:42:44.074]  They're like, oh, hi.
[02:42:44.094 --> 02:42:46.755]  And the guy's like, all right, Alex, have a good one.
[02:42:47.135 --> 02:42:48.716]  And the woman goes, let me see your ID.
[02:42:50.953 --> 02:42:54.016]  And I stuck my wallet in my back pocket of the shorts knowing that.
[02:42:54.716 --> 02:42:58.279]  And then she looked at it with pleasure and handed it back to me like looking for trouble.
[02:42:58.720 --> 02:43:01.582]  I was just like, you just want to have power over Alex Jones.
[02:43:02.463 --> 02:43:03.544]  They both knew who I was.
[02:43:04.284 --> 02:43:06.766]  And they wanted to, you know, it was just pure bull.
[02:43:07.467 --> 02:43:10.549]  There was no point to even ask me for that.
[02:43:11.790 --> 02:43:12.411]  And they knew it.
[02:43:12.711 --> 02:43:13.512]  They knew who I was.
[02:43:14.713 --> 02:43:16.454]  And I was just like, I smiled at her.
[02:43:17.695 --> 02:43:17.916]  But
[02:43:19.107 --> 02:43:20.287]  And again, it's a petty thing.
[02:43:20.327 --> 02:43:21.108]  It doesn't even matter.
[02:43:21.668 --> 02:43:32.091]  But it's like the cops trying to make the ambulance get off the road, when it's a two-lane road in the country with embankments on the sides, and the ambulance is trying to pull over, you know, so it can go around and waving.
[02:43:32.111 --> 02:43:36.092]  So the cop pulls him over and goes, how dare you wave me around with those hand gestures?
[02:43:36.112 --> 02:43:36.873]  We can see the hand gestures.
[02:43:36.893 --> 02:43:37.753]  Just come on by.
[02:43:39.313 --> 02:43:40.914]  They get into town, pulls him over.
[02:43:42.972 --> 02:43:51.902]  Yells at him for 15 minutes and then more cops show up and they start choking the head EMT saying don't resist trying to get him to resist.
[02:43:53.003 --> 02:44:01.352]  I mean, I couldn't imagine wanting to have the overwhelming odds, the guns, and to want to corner somebody for my ego to want to dominate them.
[02:44:03.129 --> 02:44:06.254]  In just an act of pure power to show me that they're boss.
[02:44:06.634 --> 02:44:08.397]  I mean, that is the essence of tyranny.
[02:44:08.778 --> 02:44:10.320]  The essence of cowardice.
[02:44:11.121 --> 02:44:13.324]  The essence of not being an honorable person.
[02:44:13.344 --> 02:44:17.010]  The opposite of being a knightly person.
[02:44:17.250 --> 02:44:18.953]  A chivalrous person.
[02:44:21.294 --> 02:44:28.298]  I mean, and that's the problem with a lot of the wimps and fake tough guys that get into the military and get into policing.
[02:44:28.579 --> 02:44:31.540]  Because in my experience, really tough guys are not looking for trouble.
[02:44:31.941 --> 02:44:35.643]  And they're confident and they know how to deal with situations that are a lot nicer.
[02:44:36.043 --> 02:44:45.289]  It's all these wannabe UFC type people who really want to show everybody they can beat everybody up and shoot everybody and tase everybody that are really going to cause a civil war in this country.
[02:44:46.784 --> 02:44:51.088]  And once it kicks off, I mean, the reason people say, let's get some violence going here.
[02:44:51.108 --> 02:44:53.070]  Do you have any idea what that's going to be like, folks?
[02:44:53.350 --> 02:44:56.973]  Let me tell you, people start violence with me offensively and hurt my family.
[02:44:57.714 --> 02:45:03.599]  I mean, you know, I'm not sitting here saying I'm the meanest guy around, but let me tell you, I could tear some stuff up real bad.
[02:45:04.299 --> 02:45:04.740]  Real bad.
[02:45:05.871 --> 02:45:08.773]  A one-man wrecking crew, like right out of the movie Terminator, folks.
[02:45:09.554 --> 02:45:14.417]  But the whole point is, is that I'm wrecking crew in the info war.
[02:45:14.517 --> 02:45:18.400]  I'm smashing the enemy up front, worldwide, head-on.
[02:45:18.460 --> 02:45:19.721]  That's where the real power is at.
[02:45:20.301 --> 02:45:28.047]  And that's what everybody should do, is in the info war, absolutely commit 110% every day to ram your fist upside the head of the liars.
[02:45:29.386 --> 02:45:30.427]  We got them down right now.
[02:45:30.487 --> 02:45:36.150]  It's time to kick their ribs in, stomp their head in, smash them, take them out, politically kill them.
[02:45:36.991 --> 02:45:37.611]  That's what we're doing.
[02:45:37.651 --> 02:45:41.854]  We are savagely, viciously attacking the enemy with the truth.
[02:45:42.814 --> 02:45:43.955]  And we're not thinking about who's winning.
[02:45:43.995 --> 02:45:44.756]  It's like a knife fight.
[02:45:44.776 --> 02:45:53.201]  We're just getting in there, staying back from their hands, and just stabbing that knife in as best we can, as hard as we can, to get it into organs.
[02:45:54.687 --> 02:45:56.288]  And that's what it comes down to, folks.
[02:45:56.768 --> 02:45:57.809]  You're not going to win a fight.
[02:45:58.169 --> 02:46:01.791]  So many fights, somebody punches you and gets a good look in, and then waits to see you fall over.
[02:46:03.572 --> 02:46:05.453]  No, that's the person that loses the fight.
[02:46:05.473 --> 02:46:09.656]  It's like somebody in a race who keeps looking back to see if they're going to win.
[02:46:09.956 --> 02:46:11.036]  Don't look back, folks.
[02:46:12.057 --> 02:46:14.659]  We're fighting people just like we are.
[02:46:14.699 --> 02:46:15.619]  They bleed red.
[02:46:16.299 --> 02:46:23.604]  And a lot of you that are wanting to shoot in war and wanting to go kill a bunch of people because you're tired of being pushed around, I know at a primitive level you want to do that, and I'm not saying you're a bad person.
[02:46:24.318 --> 02:46:26.079]  If people want to fight with you, you're ready to give them one.
[02:46:26.980 --> 02:46:27.320]  I get it.
[02:46:27.800 --> 02:46:29.762]  And unfortunately, you'll probably get a chance to do that.
[02:46:31.423 --> 02:46:34.205]  The problem is the globalists are going to sit offshore while this is going on.
[02:46:34.225 --> 02:46:36.427]  And I'd say that to all the police and military as well.
[02:46:36.647 --> 02:46:37.567]  We've got the military.
[02:46:37.607 --> 02:46:38.528]  We've got the military.
[02:46:38.888 --> 02:46:39.609]  They're awake.
[02:46:39.649 --> 02:46:40.329]  They love freedom.
[02:46:40.610 --> 02:46:41.390]  They know what's going on.
[02:46:41.410 --> 02:46:42.411]  They know treason when they see it.
[02:46:42.671 --> 02:46:44.352]  We're very close to getting the police.
[02:46:44.873 --> 02:46:45.533]  Very close.
[02:46:46.213 --> 02:46:46.794]  Very close.
[02:46:47.835 --> 02:46:52.758]  And I just, you know, talking about killing cops is not the way to fix things.
[02:46:52.858 --> 02:46:53.759]  I'm just going to tell you right now.
[02:46:55.325 --> 02:46:59.488]  The police are the manifestation of this sick society.
[02:46:59.869 --> 02:47:01.730]  They're a manifestation of the moral decline.
[02:47:03.091 --> 02:47:06.874]  I mean, the general public is very immoral now, on average.
[02:47:07.795 --> 02:47:11.939]  The general public is sneaky, backstabbing, manipulative.
[02:47:12.019 --> 02:47:22.027]  I mean, the police are now, the problems you're seeing are a manifestation of the thug culture that is permeating and infesting everything.
[02:47:23.863 --> 02:47:30.549]  And so I would say this, I would prepare defensively to defend yourself and to not be taken to a forced labor camp, and that is the public plan.
[02:47:31.630 --> 02:47:33.411]  I'm not going to a forced labor camp, folks.
[02:47:33.571 --> 02:47:34.212]  It's not happening.
[02:47:35.133 --> 02:47:39.697]  But I'm going to work as hard as I can before that happens, to do everything I can.
[02:47:40.794 --> 02:47:45.975]  You know, the Mel Gibson movie, The Patriot, is a composite of three people out of Virginia and the Carolinas.
[02:47:46.355 --> 02:47:47.575]  The Swamp Fox being one of them.
[02:47:47.816 --> 02:47:48.856]  That's actually a true story.
[02:47:49.416 --> 02:47:50.216]  He was a British soldier.
[02:47:50.256 --> 02:47:52.537]  He did everything he could to stay out of it.
[02:47:52.557 --> 02:47:56.637]  But, you know, they killed one of his kids, so he killed a couple hundred people himself.
[02:47:57.818 --> 02:47:59.258]  And, you know, that's just how this works.
[02:48:00.298 --> 02:48:03.759]  But I'm not hoping one of my kids gets killed so I can go haywire and go kill a bunch of people.
[02:48:05.140 --> 02:48:06.441]  I don't want that to happen.
[02:48:06.781 --> 02:48:08.402]  I've got those tools as a man.
[02:48:08.802 --> 02:48:09.483]  I am a killer.
[02:48:09.963 --> 02:48:11.324]  Any real man is a killer.
[02:48:11.624 --> 02:48:12.445]  We're all killers.
[02:48:12.465 --> 02:48:13.345]  That's nothing special.
[02:48:13.605 --> 02:48:14.666]  It's easy to be a killer.
[02:48:15.367 --> 02:48:16.707]  It's hard to be a builder.
[02:48:17.028 --> 02:48:18.949]  It's hard to convince people to not have a war.
[02:48:19.369 --> 02:48:23.392]  It's hard to reach out and deprogram people about the globalist takeover.
[02:48:23.612 --> 02:48:24.773]  It's high-tech brainwashing.
[02:48:25.526 --> 02:48:28.367]  You can't be mad at most these people that they've been brought into this system.
[02:48:29.187 --> 02:48:31.528]  You've got to reach out to them.
[02:48:32.288 --> 02:48:47.752]  And imagine, if you're really talking about being ready to kill people, you better be at the city council, you better be going into the cop shops talking to them, you better be going into the coffee shops, and not just them, the city council, the county commissioners, the state houses, talking to hundreds of people a day.
[02:48:47.772 --> 02:48:52.334]  And I'm not rebuking what you said, I'm just, I'm saying, you've got to info-war hard as you can
[02:48:53.274 --> 02:48:57.717]  Hoping we can avert physical war, but then ensuring our victory if it goes to that.
[02:48:58.437 --> 02:48:59.298]  And then committing!
[02:49:01.739 --> 02:49:08.223]  I mean, if you get to the point of actually thinking about you want to kill people, how would it go if we just randomly went out and killed somebody?
[02:49:08.263 --> 02:49:13.146]  It'd be used against us, and it'd be immoral, and you can't just randomly pick someone who you can't prove's done something.
[02:49:14.051 --> 02:49:16.572]  That's what real criminals do, and I'm not saying you were implying that.
[02:49:16.872 --> 02:49:23.694]  You're saying somebody ever messes with you, somebody ever pushes you around, somebody ever violates you, you're going to come up on them.
[02:49:23.994 --> 02:49:24.514]  And I get it!
[02:49:25.714 --> 02:49:27.195]  I totally understand what you're saying.
[02:49:27.555 --> 02:49:33.616]  There's a big phenomenon all over the country of state police and others being killed because they'll pull over and harass old veterans.
[02:49:34.357 --> 02:49:42.659]  Most of the old World War II veterans are dead now, but I see it every few weeks where some World War II vet being harassed at checkpoints or by cops just pulls out their rifle and starts shooting cops.
[02:49:43.581 --> 02:49:45.402]  Because old-timers would kill people.
[02:49:45.422 --> 02:49:52.707]  I mean, I will tell you right now that especially my dad's dad would not put up with it.
[02:49:52.967 --> 02:49:58.190]  And my mom's dad got pulled over in Central Texas one time by Border Patrol.
[02:49:59.428 --> 02:50:02.569]  Because, you know, he was driving an El Camino and wearing a cowboy hat.
[02:50:02.649 --> 02:50:05.370]  I guess that's what the Mexican cowboys would drive.
[02:50:05.410 --> 02:50:11.532]  But the point is, is they pulled him over and he was mad for a month about that when they were asking for assistance.
[02:50:11.892 --> 02:50:13.972]  People say, well, why don't you just help the cops, work with them?
[02:50:14.453 --> 02:50:21.975]  The point is, that's not the American system for normal people to have contact with the police, normal people to be shoved up against the wall and ask questions.
[02:50:22.375 --> 02:50:24.736]  What we're being trained and given is prisoner training.
[02:50:26.896 --> 02:50:28.437]  And that's what this comes down to.
[02:50:29.967 --> 02:50:32.049]  And the old World War II vets just wouldn't put up with it.
[02:50:32.389 --> 02:50:33.990]  Oh, they were the greatest generation, though.
[02:50:34.290 --> 02:50:37.452]  Well, they wouldn't live like this, and the World War II vets I know wouldn't put up with it.
[02:50:37.953 --> 02:50:42.476]  And they got Korean War vets killing cops, and the police know that.
[02:50:42.516 --> 02:50:43.857]  They watch out pulling over old men.
[02:50:45.338 --> 02:50:47.399]  But men soon won't be like that at all.
[02:50:48.320 --> 02:50:53.143]  It's just, you know, we're literally, bars will probably start castrating us, and that'll be the end of it.
[02:50:53.163 --> 02:50:54.464]  I'm going to come back and take more calls.
[02:50:56.261 --> 02:51:03.305]  Ammo purchases post office and we're going to talk to Gus and Jason and Damien in FEMA Region 5 and Billy.
[02:51:04.006 --> 02:51:05.427]  Infowars.com is the website.

[02:51:39.413 --> 02:51:48.623]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:51:48.703 --> 02:51:49.423]  This capitalism?
[02:51:49.483 --> 02:51:55.585]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:51:55.645 --> 02:51:59.286]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[02:54:19.784 --> 02:54:20.844]  She was lovely.
[02:54:21.285 --> 02:54:23.365]  She was the queen of our hearts.
[02:54:23.946 --> 02:54:27.247]  There in the darkness with the radio playing loud.
[02:54:27.587 --> 02:54:28.348]  Flushering that.
[02:54:28.648 --> 02:54:31.569]  All those pictures days are past me now.
[02:54:31.929 --> 02:54:34.910]  I got so much more to think about.
[02:54:35.871 --> 02:54:36.831]  Deadlines.
[02:54:37.931 --> 02:54:40.733]  Deadlines and commitments.
[02:54:41.053 --> 02:54:42.233]  What to leave in.
[02:54:42.653 --> 02:54:43.734]  What to leave out.
[02:54:44.014 --> 02:54:46.435]  Alright, let's go back to your calls.
[02:54:48.331 --> 02:54:50.333]  Tyranny is running against the wind of history.
[02:54:52.434 --> 02:54:54.116]  And it's time is coming, my friends.
[02:54:55.317 --> 02:54:58.359]  We were young and strong, we were just running against the wind.
[02:54:58.900 --> 02:55:00.481]  But old Hillary isn't young and strong.
[02:55:01.782 --> 02:55:04.404]  She can feel the hellfire lapping her big ol' booty.
[02:55:04.965 --> 02:55:07.087]  Let's talk to Fred Rico in New York.
[02:55:07.147 --> 02:55:08.528]  I'm sorry, folks, I'm gonna stop.
[02:55:08.908 --> 02:55:10.910]  Fred Rico, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:55:11.650 --> 02:55:13.652]  Hey Alex, how you doing today, my brother?
[02:55:14.172 --> 02:55:17.215]  I'm doing alright, but just thinking about Hillary Clinton made me want to vomit, sorry.
[02:55:18.059 --> 02:55:18.640]  Yeah, me too.
[02:55:18.680 --> 02:55:19.440]  That's really gross.
[02:55:20.681 --> 02:55:21.842]  Think about her and her girlfriends.
[02:55:21.862 --> 02:55:22.803]  That's really disgusting.
[02:55:24.324 --> 02:55:29.068]  Listen, people don't... That's Lachnett and Yahoo playing golf with Hitler.
[02:55:29.428 --> 02:55:30.129]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:55:31.790 --> 02:55:34.692]  A lot of people don't look at their surroundings.
[02:55:34.892 --> 02:55:39.456]  I do a lot of work for post offices and subway restaurants and stuff like that.
[02:55:40.277 --> 02:55:46.922]  People do not realize the amount of postal police cars that are around them.
[02:55:47.560 --> 02:55:56.027]  People just know those of regular police, but there is a lot of activity of postal police in Brooklyn, in Queens, the Bronx... No, no, I agree.
[02:55:56.047 --> 02:56:01.672]  We actually got contacted by the post office, and the kid who wrote the article that was on Drudge said he's updating it.
[02:56:02.433 --> 02:56:06.417]  But they countered us that they're expanding their police force, and that's why they're buying ammo.
[02:56:06.617 --> 02:56:07.397]  That's the point.
[02:56:07.618 --> 02:56:12.021]  All these groups are expanding their police forces, buying billions of rounds of ammo.
[02:56:12.042 --> 02:56:12.322]  Go ahead.
[02:56:13.510 --> 02:56:16.711]  Yes, and another thing, you guys have to understand another thing.
[02:56:17.531 --> 02:56:22.753]  According to them, there is people stealing packages and stuff from the Postal Service, their employees.
[02:56:22.793 --> 02:56:32.576]  They are using their own employees, but they are putting some tracking devices in a lot of people's packages to monitor where these packages come from.
[02:56:32.616 --> 02:56:33.816]  They go and come back.
[02:56:33.896 --> 02:56:38.538]  But the thing is, these postal police actually are not doing any raids or nothing.
[02:56:38.918 --> 02:56:39.698]  They are just
[02:56:40.137 --> 02:56:44.479]  Well, every agency is expanding or trying to get armed law enforcement.
[02:56:44.499 --> 02:56:45.979]  It's like bling or something.
[02:57:08.337 --> 02:57:11.378]  It's just a sign of the authoritarian third world slide.
[02:57:11.418 --> 02:57:11.898]  Great points.
[02:57:12.318 --> 02:57:13.458]  Good to hear from you, Frederico.
[02:57:13.898 --> 02:57:15.599]  By the way, I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:57:15.619 --> 02:57:16.459]  on the Sunday Transmission.
[02:57:16.479 --> 02:57:17.179]  Just thought I'd add that.
[02:57:17.579 --> 02:57:18.659]  Jason in Florida.
[02:57:19.359 --> 02:57:20.080]  Go ahead.
[02:57:20.140 --> 02:57:21.120]  You're on the air.
[02:57:22.200 --> 02:57:24.761]  Sir, Alex Jones, you are an American hero.
[02:57:24.821 --> 02:57:25.361]  No, I'm not.
[02:57:25.381 --> 02:57:25.781]  Go ahead.
[02:57:26.581 --> 02:57:29.542]  I missed you by just a few hours with Dallas Fed in 2012.
[02:57:30.742 --> 02:57:35.063]  And I gave them Cobb-Seldo, but... What's going on with Joe Rogan?
[02:57:35.083 --> 02:57:36.003]  I see that on the screen.
[02:57:36.857 --> 02:57:37.880]  Yeah, two questions for you.
[02:57:37.940 --> 02:57:44.355]  I was wondering if, uh, I listen to Joe Rogan's podcast pretty religiously and I'll tell you about 80% of the time he mentions you.
[02:57:45.635 --> 02:57:48.137]  And, uh, I was just wondering if you're going to be on that anytime soon?
[02:57:48.237 --> 02:57:59.065]  Yeah, no, his show is a mega popular international sensation with millions and millions of listeners, uh, every time he does it, and viewers, and he, Joe is quite frankly, uh, irritated, and he's right.
[02:57:59.085 --> 02:58:03.148]  I've been promising to come out there for like four years and go on his show, and I want to.
[02:58:03.549 --> 02:58:13.016]  I've known Joe since like 98, we're really good friends, and, uh, he's really a sweetheart and always plugs the show, and, uh, he's a good guy, uh, and I want to go on his show very, very badly.
[02:58:13.945 --> 02:58:14.626]  I hope you do, man.
[02:58:14.706 --> 02:58:16.028]  It'll be a big show.
[02:58:16.749 --> 02:58:18.632]  One more question.
[02:58:18.692 --> 02:58:24.481]  I was wondering if you agreed or disagreed with Webster Tarpley's analysis of the
[02:58:25.211 --> 02:58:26.672]  Snowden-Greenwald deal.
[02:58:27.132 --> 02:58:29.474]  He's calling it a limited hangout operation.
[02:58:29.614 --> 02:58:30.935]  Yeah, I don't agree with that at all.
[02:58:30.955 --> 02:58:35.939]  I don't agree with Webster on the turn of events, the pro-Obama stuff and Hillary stuff.
[02:58:35.959 --> 02:58:37.760]  I mean, he's a big Hillary Clinton supporter.
[02:58:38.380 --> 02:58:46.946]  Webster, you know, I just don't buy into a lot of stuff that old Webster has to say.
[02:58:46.966 --> 02:58:47.747]  But he is a character.
[02:58:47.787 --> 02:58:48.708]  I like him as a person.
[02:58:49.248 --> 02:58:51.530]  He's a fun guy to go out and have dinner with.
[02:58:53.326 --> 02:58:54.086]  I will be right back.
[02:58:54.106 --> 02:58:55.927]  I'm gonna do an extra time for the invitation.
[02:58:56.367 --> 02:58:56.867]  Alex!
[02:58:58.168 --> 02:58:58.848]  Ah, Putin!

[03:00:03.997 --> 03:00:07.198]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:14.403 --> 03:00:15.044]  Big Brother.
[03:00:15.704 --> 03:00:16.725]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:17.466 --> 03:00:18.567]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:19.228 --> 03:00:20.029]  You want answers?
[03:00:20.810 --> 03:00:21.711]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:22.351 --> 03:00:25.995]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:26.556 --> 03:00:30.600]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:34.823 --> 03:00:36.304]  I'm calling Watson right now.
[03:00:36.324 --> 03:00:38.866]  I've got to watch Infowars.com a little bit closer.
[03:00:38.906 --> 03:00:40.127]  This has been out for like 30 minutes.
[03:00:40.207 --> 03:00:41.668]  I didn't even plug it during the main show.
[03:00:42.328 --> 03:00:47.112]  TSA agents interrogate Jewish author for reading conservative newspaper.
[03:00:47.172 --> 03:00:49.293]  Federal goons assume role of political thought police.
[03:00:49.794 --> 03:00:50.914]  Hey Watson, hold on one second.
[03:00:51.575 --> 03:00:56.999]  This is incredible because it's like that chief of police was flying to the Constitution meeting.
[03:00:57.719 --> 03:00:59.500]  And they had that data and interrogated him.
[03:00:59.920 --> 03:01:03.381]  Watson, you're absolutely, I'm on air right now, you're absolutely right that they're doing this.
[03:01:03.401 --> 03:01:07.983]  This is their new threat fusion center deal where they quote, check you out before you get there.
[03:01:08.463 --> 03:01:10.604]  So hopefully you'll add that point about the police chief.
[03:01:10.944 --> 03:01:12.605]  This is getting really creepy, man.
[03:01:13.405 --> 03:01:24.915]  But she was reading a mainline Jewish newspaper and so they, I mean that's like in England where they were reading the Daily Mail or something and remember they questioned people like in downtown London.
[03:01:25.396 --> 03:01:26.597]  Why are you reading that newspaper?
[03:01:26.617 --> 03:01:28.759]  I mean this is really, this is secret police.
[03:01:28.799 --> 03:01:29.820]  What are you reading there?
[03:01:30.180 --> 03:01:31.601]  I mean this is outrageous Watson.
[03:01:33.243 --> 03:01:37.807]  Well they also let a woman pass with full face dress without checking her identity.
[03:01:38.147 --> 03:01:38.647]  A Muslim.
[03:01:39.268 --> 03:01:40.469]  At the exact same time.
[03:01:43.120 --> 03:01:45.182]  Well, this is just getting amazing, Watson.
[03:01:46.382 --> 03:01:47.783]  I mean, we're living in the twilight zone here.
[03:01:47.803 --> 03:01:49.625]  This should be a huge national story.
[03:01:49.645 --> 03:01:51.846]  I mean, this is just getting... It's on Drudge.
[03:01:52.607 --> 03:01:53.167]  Our story is?
[03:01:53.948 --> 03:01:54.168]  Yeah.
[03:01:54.588 --> 03:01:55.009]  Oh, cool.
[03:01:55.029 --> 03:01:55.809]  DrudgeReport.com?
[03:01:56.350 --> 03:01:57.631]  I love the DrudgeReport.com.
[03:01:57.651 --> 03:01:58.291]  Where is it on there?
[03:02:00.273 --> 03:02:02.054]  Middle right-hand column somewhere.
[03:02:02.774 --> 03:02:04.155]  Middle right-hand column.
[03:02:04.796 --> 03:02:08.279]  TSA interrogates Jewish author for reading conservative newspaper.
[03:02:08.459 --> 03:02:11.281]  That's pretty pathetic when Drudge already knows about stuff on my site before I do.
[03:02:12.506 --> 03:02:14.007]  You guys, I have a great crew.
[03:02:14.268 --> 03:02:16.930]  You've got to stay on top of the breaking InfoWars stories.
[03:02:17.871 --> 03:02:19.913]  I mean, you're giving me all these other stories around the world and that's great.
[03:02:19.933 --> 03:02:20.693]  We've got to watch our site.
[03:02:20.713 --> 03:02:21.394]  Great job, the crew.
[03:02:21.414 --> 03:02:22.054]  I'm not complaining.
[03:02:22.335 --> 03:02:23.215]  I'm complaining about myself.
[03:02:23.236 --> 03:02:24.437]  I've got the site right here in front of me.
[03:02:24.897 --> 03:02:26.779]  Let's see what else broke on InfoWars.com.
[03:02:27.639 --> 03:02:29.181]  How's my favorite little redcoat doing?
[03:02:29.201 --> 03:02:31.703]  Not too bad.
[03:02:32.504 --> 03:02:33.465]  Perfect timing.
[03:02:35.066 --> 03:02:35.747]  Oh, here's that article.
[03:02:35.787 --> 03:02:36.968]  Crews and... Oh, you're eating.
[03:02:37.628 --> 03:02:38.229]  Paul has a joke.
[03:02:38.249 --> 03:02:39.470]  I always call when he... Huh?
[03:02:42.745 --> 03:02:43.585]  What did you have to eat?
[03:02:46.206 --> 03:02:48.787]  Chicken and rice and egg.
[03:02:48.807 --> 03:02:48.847]  Ah!
[03:02:48.907 --> 03:02:49.747]  Redcoat meal.
[03:02:49.767 --> 03:02:50.828]  Look at this.
[03:02:50.948 --> 03:02:54.709]  Cruz and Paul turn up the heat on Democratic establishment.
[03:02:55.849 --> 03:02:58.910]  That's a really good article getting into all the stuff with Clinton.
[03:02:59.550 --> 03:03:01.971]  Hey, we haven't talked about how I'm speaking.
[03:03:02.251 --> 03:03:06.832]  Is it the 12th of March at Oxford to the main faculty in the main Oxford Hall?
[03:03:06.852 --> 03:03:07.653]  That's pretty trendy, huh?
[03:03:07.673 --> 03:03:10.594]  It's pretty trendy, yes.
[03:03:10.714 --> 03:03:11.614]  Members only, though.
[03:03:13.029 --> 03:03:13.789]  Very exclusive.
[03:03:13.829 --> 03:03:13.989]  Yeah.
[03:03:14.009 --> 03:03:15.550]  Alright, take care.
[03:03:15.630 --> 03:03:19.031]  No, that's pretty much it, along with the Jay Leno thing is pretty big.
[03:03:39.591 --> 03:03:43.253]  I don't know though, in those emails and phone calls, they tell you guys it was off record.
[03:03:44.073 --> 03:03:45.834]  I remember reading them, it didn't say it was off record.
[03:03:47.815 --> 03:03:52.637]  That is kind of newsworthy that the brass wouldn't let me on there, and Jay wanted me, it doesn't even matter.
[03:03:53.057 --> 03:03:54.458]  Alright Watson, good job, I'll see ya.
[03:03:55.218 --> 03:03:55.778]  Alright, see ya.
[03:03:56.018 --> 03:03:56.258]  See ya.
[03:03:57.159 --> 03:03:59.320]  We just, look, I'm sorry, I'm out of time.
[03:04:00.140 --> 03:04:06.583]  I'm sorry, uh... Youth help of the cause with Gus, Kathy, and Billy.
[03:04:08.101 --> 03:04:10.262]  50 Cal Gun, Bitcoins, Darren.
[03:04:10.323 --> 03:04:10.923]  I'm just out of time.
[03:04:10.963 --> 03:04:11.603]  I gotta go.
[03:04:11.623 --> 03:04:13.164]  I got a bunch of work I gotta do.
[03:04:13.204 --> 03:04:14.285]  But I got a lot of calls today.
[03:04:14.625 --> 03:04:15.566]  I covered most of the news.
[03:04:15.606 --> 03:04:16.486]  I did an okay job.
[03:04:16.907 --> 03:04:18.367]  The crew did a good job as well.
[03:04:19.688 --> 03:04:20.909]  But that is just crazy!
[03:04:20.989 --> 03:04:25.772]  TSA agent interrogates Jewish author for reading conservative newspaper.
[03:04:25.792 --> 03:04:27.733]  Then I was reading the article.
[03:04:27.793 --> 03:04:28.574]  It's just crazy.
[03:04:28.594 --> 03:04:30.875]  But the thing is, it's happening more and more.
[03:04:30.895 --> 03:04:31.696]  It's happening to people I know.
[03:04:33.373 --> 03:04:37.576]  And they'll ask him, what's that magazine?
[03:04:38.637 --> 03:04:39.597]  It's the Economist.
[03:04:39.677 --> 03:04:40.318]  What's it about?
[03:04:41.178 --> 03:04:43.760]  I mean, it's just, it's total North Korea.
[03:04:45.401 --> 03:04:47.303]  And again, they're trying to go a million miles.
[03:04:48.123 --> 03:04:50.485]  And we push back 500,000, we're still down the rat hole.
[03:04:51.664 --> 03:04:54.508]  They try to take us a trillion light years, we push them back 500 billion.
[03:04:55.369 --> 03:04:57.893]  We're still, you know, way down the road here of evil.
[03:04:57.953 --> 03:05:01.437]  I mean, it's a revolution of scum and criminals over us.
[03:05:01.858 --> 03:05:02.579]  Great job with the crews.
[03:05:02.599 --> 03:05:04.421]  See you back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:05:04.441 --> 03:05:08.026]  for the Sunday Transmission and we have the nightly news 7 o'clock tonight.
