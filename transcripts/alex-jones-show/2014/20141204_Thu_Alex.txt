[00:00:01.644 --> 00:00:04.249]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:16.448 --> 00:00:20.634]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:21.295 --> 00:00:22.096]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.877 --> 00:00:23.799]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.085]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.606 --> 00:00:32.651]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:36.290]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.371]  I'm David Knight, your host today on this Thursday, December 4th, 2014.
[00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:43.413]  Things are getting really crazy, folks.
[00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:48.435]  Not only these grand jury non-indictments, but the reactions of people.
[00:00:48.455 --> 00:00:51.116]  We've got a story up on InfoWars right now.
[00:00:51.616 --> 00:00:56.418]  Left has gone insane saying that White Christmas is now racist.
[00:00:56.538 --> 00:00:58.379]  They had actually had people tweet that out.
[00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:06.762]  Uh, angry about the ceremony at Rockefeller Center where they lighted the Christmas tree and played White Christmas saying that that was racist.
[00:01:06.782 --> 00:01:10.884]  That's the story up by Paul Joseph Watson and he's going to be joining us in the second hour.
[00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:11.864]  We're going to talk about that.
[00:01:12.244 --> 00:01:14.846]  We're also going to talk about another one of his stories up there.
[00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:18.027]  Cops celebrate the Garner decision also on Twitter.
[00:01:18.047 --> 00:01:20.188]  It's amazing to see what, uh,
[00:01:20.968 --> 00:01:22.089]  What people really think.
[00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.331]  It's kind of like looking at Twitter.
[00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:26.173]  It's kind of like doing a man on the street.
[00:01:26.213 --> 00:01:27.734]  You can really see what people think.
[00:01:28.074 --> 00:01:29.576]  So you got some cops talking about it.
[00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:30.997]  They said, let's celebrate.
[00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:32.879]  Let's kick some thug butt.
[00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:34.080]  It's a euphemism.
[00:01:35.141 --> 00:01:36.562]  That's not exactly what he said.
[00:01:37.423 --> 00:01:38.684]  But that's another article from Paul.
[00:01:38.704 --> 00:01:40.586]  So he's going to be joining us in the second hour.
[00:01:40.646 --> 00:01:42.788]  He's going to be with us the second and third hour.
[00:01:43.871 --> 00:01:47.733]  Also joining us in the second hour is going to be Lionel, the talk show host.
[00:01:47.773 --> 00:01:53.135]  He's based out of New York, so interested to see what he's seen there as an eyewitness.
[00:01:53.175 --> 00:01:55.396]  And of course, he's a former prosecutor and defense attorney.
[00:01:56.056 --> 00:02:01.399]  I want to also talk about what's going on with these grand jury indictments or non-indictments.
[00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:10.262]  That's something that I don't think really has been covered enough, how the system is corrupt and working not to investigate itself.
[00:02:10.282 --> 00:02:11.423]  I mean, when you've got the government
[00:02:12.023 --> 00:02:14.644]  Investigating itself, doing it in secret.
[00:02:14.664 --> 00:02:18.604]  Do you really think you're going to get anything other than non-indictments?
[00:02:19.424 --> 00:02:24.305]  They've been training police, and we see these, several of these recent incidents.
[00:02:24.325 --> 00:02:26.866]  It's been rookie cops who have done the shooting.
[00:02:26.886 --> 00:02:30.347]  They're along with a veteran cop, but it's a rookie who comes out shooting.
[00:02:30.387 --> 00:02:34.787]  The rookie with his gun drawn, who shoots somebody without warning, shoots somebody who's not armed.
[00:02:35.047 --> 00:02:36.148]  We see this over and over again.
[00:02:36.368 --> 00:02:37.668]  We've seen that in New Mexico.
[00:02:38.268 --> 00:02:49.672]  They're actually training what, in the State Police Academy, we had a veteran instructor angry about the fact that they were teaching what he said was a shoot first curriculum.
[00:02:50.092 --> 00:02:57.035]  This veteran police instructor at the police, the State Police Academy, called them out on it and basically they wouldn't do it.
[00:02:57.095 --> 00:03:01.156]  He resigned or, I don't know if he resigned or they fired him, but basically he wouldn't do it.
[00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:02.937]  The rules are changing.
[00:03:04.298 --> 00:03:08.703]  They're changing the way they're teaching the cops and of course we've been covering the militarization of the police.
[00:03:08.723 --> 00:03:10.104]  We see the equipment that they're giving them.
[00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:22.498]  Now of course Obama has come out with some prescriptions for correcting this and there you see that picture that was up in New Mexico and of course they got that on film and of course we got the filming of
[00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:29.257]  Of Mr. Garner, who was just killed, but, you know, the solution is going to be get more cameras.
[00:03:29.597 --> 00:03:31.059]  No, that's not the solution.
[00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:33.941]  It's just going to, that's not changing anything.
[00:03:33.981 --> 00:03:44.651]  If you don't change how you're instructing them, essentially the rules of engagement, because they're being told they're working in a military environment, if you don't change that mindset,
[00:03:45.111 --> 00:03:52.157]  That they're out there, that there's people who want to kill them, and if they don't shoot first, they're not going to come home to their families.
[00:03:52.257 --> 00:03:57.761]  If you don't stop that, if you don't stop the military mindset, it isn't going to do any good to have the cameras out there.
[00:03:58.081 --> 00:04:00.063]  But he's also come up with some other solutions.
[00:04:00.463 --> 00:04:07.048]  We're going to take a look at the former police commissioner, or maybe he still is a police commissioner in Philadelphia.
[00:04:07.068 --> 00:04:07.709]  I think he is.
[00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.253]  But anyway, he's going to put him in charge of his task force on 21st century policing.
[00:04:14.833 --> 00:04:17.154]  Can you imagine what that task force is going to look like?
[00:04:17.174 --> 00:04:20.256]  We're going to look at the background of this police chief.
[00:04:21.577 --> 00:04:24.378]  It's not anybody that I would put in charge of it.
[00:04:24.418 --> 00:04:28.661]  He has had a lot of problems, a lot of problems in his department.
[00:04:28.681 --> 00:04:29.381]  We're going to look at that.
[00:04:29.421 --> 00:04:34.504]  And of course, Eric Holder is talking about it as simply being a racial issue.
[00:04:34.564 --> 00:04:35.685]  He's promising now to
[00:04:36.505 --> 00:04:39.007]  End racial profiling once and for all.
[00:05:10.498 --> 00:05:14.359]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:21.361]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.
[00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:30.524]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior vitality in males and females.

[00:05:40.543 --> 00:05:44.045]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:44.185 --> 00:05:48.168]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:48.468 --> 00:05:49.929]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:55.293]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[00:05:55.593 --> 00:05:57.855]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[00:05:58.115 --> 00:05:58.975]  But for how long?
[00:05:59.256 --> 00:06:01.257]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[00:06:01.457 --> 00:06:05.520]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.722]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.601]  In the near future.
[00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:16.504]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[00:06:16.524 --> 00:06:16.984]  Security alert.
[00:06:17.365 --> 00:06:18.365]  Security alert.
[00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:20.307]  This is Homeland Security.

[00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:29.134]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:06:29.174 --> 00:06:30.094]  Prime Directive.
[00:06:30.214 --> 00:06:31.655]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:06:31.756 --> 00:06:34.538]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:06:34.618 --> 00:06:37.660]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.022]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:06:40.322 --> 00:06:41.643]  These people are assaulting us.
[00:06:41.663 --> 00:06:43.985]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:06:44.485 --> 00:06:46.186]  They are never going to stop.
[00:06:46.446 --> 00:06:50.329]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[00:07:00.476 --> 00:07:04.859]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:06.500]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.261]  You can feel it.
[00:07:10.017 --> 00:07:16.300]  When I first got online and I seen the price of the X2 and the DNA Force, I was a little hesitant, but I pulled the trigger on it.
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.420]  It has changed my life.
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.521]  I've been taking it for about 24 days now.
[00:07:19.601 --> 00:07:20.962]  Counting the weights, staying in shape.

[00:07:29.126 --> 00:07:31.007]  Prior to this, I was barely walking.
[00:07:31.107 --> 00:07:33.768]  Now, I'm able to function as a human again.
[00:07:33.848 --> 00:07:51.353]  Whether it's Survival Shield Nascent Iodine or DNA Force, Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality, Lung Cleanse, Fluoride Shields, Oxy Powder, I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:51.793 --> 00:07:52.533]  That's true.

[00:07:57.396 --> 00:07:58.136]  It's great stuff.
[00:07:58.176 --> 00:08:01.978]  If I'm going to promote something, it's got to be something I personally use and that I believe in.

[00:08:38.914 --> 00:08:40.295]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:40.396 --> 00:08:41.557]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[00:08:42.677 --> 00:08:44.678]  It's a strange news day today.
[00:08:44.738 --> 00:08:47.200]  We've got an article up on Infowars.com.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.343]  The left has gone insane saying, White Christmas is now racist.
[00:08:51.383 --> 00:09:05.592]  That was a tweet from somebody angry about the ceremony yesterday in New York at Rockefeller Center, of course, in the wake of the non-indictment of the officer who murdered Eric Garner.
[00:09:06.272 --> 00:09:07.233]  And I say murdered.
[00:09:07.594 --> 00:09:09.476]  It is definitely a homicide.
[00:09:09.576 --> 00:09:11.739]  I'm not the one saying that by myself.
[00:09:11.819 --> 00:09:16.105]  Of course, that was the coroner said that, but the grand jury did not return an indictment.
[00:09:16.125 --> 00:09:16.785]  So we're going to look at that.
[00:09:16.805 --> 00:09:18.007]  We're going to look at people's reaction.
[00:09:18.367 --> 00:09:22.673]  We're going to look at real racism, manufactured racism.
[00:09:22.833 --> 00:09:39.440]  Not just from people on Twitter talking about how white privilege is on display here, but we're also going to talk about the manufactured racism of Eric Holder and Obama, and we're also going to talk about Obama's proposed solutions.
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.843]  There's non-solutions of getting more cameras.
[00:09:42.883 --> 00:09:45.145]  Hey, they recorded what happened there.
[00:09:45.185 --> 00:09:45.965]  That didn't do any good.
[00:09:46.005 --> 00:09:51.350]  They recorded what happened when the homeless man was shot in the hills outside of Albuquerque.
[00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:58.457]  They recorded the homeless man being shot by eight police officers shooting 49 shots at him from a distance.
[00:09:58.497 --> 00:09:59.198]  He was unarmed.
[00:09:59.458 --> 00:10:00.619]  We've seen these recordings.
[00:10:00.639 --> 00:10:02.380]  We've seen them ad nauseum.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.562]  We've seen the video that went viral, over a million views.
[00:10:06.802 --> 00:10:08.683]  This is what happens when you call the cops.
[00:10:09.123 --> 00:10:12.245]  We've got that linked up on InfoWars from a couple of days ago.
[00:10:12.925 --> 00:10:13.486]  We've seen it!
[00:10:14.386 --> 00:10:17.089]  It just makes us angry because they're not doing anything about it.
[00:10:17.109 --> 00:10:20.933]  But of course, that's what the police are being trained for in the police academies.
[00:10:21.373 --> 00:10:23.195]  But we're also going to talk about some good cops.
[00:10:23.215 --> 00:10:25.898]  We're going to talk about some honest cops in Illinois.
[00:10:25.918 --> 00:10:28.520]  Like I said, of all places you wouldn't really expect that.
[00:10:29.461 --> 00:10:33.605]  Suing their police department because they've been given arrest quotas.
[00:10:34.406 --> 00:10:36.828]  Told to arrest people even without probable cause.
[00:10:36.908 --> 00:10:40.732]  We've seen that happen in New York in the case of Adrian Schoolcraft.
[00:10:40.772 --> 00:10:43.675]  He recorded the police there for a long time.
[00:10:43.715 --> 00:10:46.878]  He wore a mic because he knew that was what was happening there.
[00:10:47.901 --> 00:10:48.981]  A great whistleblower.
[00:10:49.942 --> 00:10:54.663]  He was told on occasions to go out and arrest people on Halloween.
[00:10:54.783 --> 00:11:05.007]  He said they told him to go out and just pick up the first three to five people that they get, bring them back, we'll work out the charges later, don't stick around and do the paperwork, and then go out and get another three to five.
[00:11:06.024 --> 00:11:08.246]  He's got recordings of them saying that.
[00:11:08.266 --> 00:11:09.287]  You want to talk about recordings?
[00:11:09.448 --> 00:11:10.929]  He's got recordings of them saying that.
[00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:12.311]  What are they doing about it?
[00:11:12.991 --> 00:11:21.100]  Well, when they found out that he was recording these arrest quotas, these illegal actions that they were giving... Oh, and there's another thing I've got to tell you too.
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:22.882]  Adrian Schoolcraft
[00:11:23.342 --> 00:11:49.789]  pointed out that they were covering up serious crime meanwhile going after people really hard on small minor variations things like we just saw with the Eric Garner case you know when you got bankers who steal billions of dollars from people and they get interest-free loans yet you got one guy with a petty crime selling some loose cigarettes and he gets killed on the streets
[00:11:50.689 --> 00:11:54.813]  That's what has been going on for a very long time in the city of New York.
[00:11:54.973 --> 00:11:57.455]  That's what Adrian Schoolcraft was primarily showing.
[00:11:57.835 --> 00:12:04.521]  He was showing that when people would report a rape or a car theft, they didn't want those serious crime statistics to show up.
[00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:06.763]  They wanted to show that crime was going down.
[00:12:06.783 --> 00:12:10.366]  Giuliani bragged about that, you know, he's getting serious crime down.
[00:12:10.646 --> 00:12:14.449]  Well, the way they did it was they would show up and they would say, your car really wasn't stolen.
[00:12:14.489 --> 00:12:19.213]  Don't you remember that you had a cousin who you loaned it to?
[00:12:19.273 --> 00:12:23.116]  Because if you file this as a car theft, you're going to be tied up.
[00:12:23.136 --> 00:12:24.337]  You're going to lose a lot of work.
[00:12:24.357 --> 00:12:25.518]  You've got a lot of paperwork to do.
[00:12:25.739 --> 00:12:26.960]  They would tell that to rape victims.
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.101]  They would say, you're going to have to go to court.
[00:12:29.261 --> 00:12:31.163]  You're going to have to relive all of this stuff.
[00:12:31.483 --> 00:12:33.945]  Your reputation is going to be publicly ruined.
[00:12:34.486 --> 00:12:36.648]  You don't really want to say this is a rape.
[00:12:36.708 --> 00:12:39.029]  Don't you want to change your story and not report this as a rape?
[00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:44.986]  But then when it came to petty violations, you got too much hair on the floor of your barber shop.
[00:12:45.814 --> 00:12:48.336]  They would hit those people with a couple hundred dollar fines.
[00:12:48.836 --> 00:12:50.237]  That's the city of New York.
[00:12:50.717 --> 00:12:51.938]  That's Giuliani's New York.
[00:12:52.018 --> 00:12:53.039]  That's Bloomberg's New York.
[00:12:53.079 --> 00:12:54.380]  That's Blasio's New York.
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.361]  That's been New York for a long time.
[00:12:57.162 --> 00:12:58.663]  That's what's really behind.
[00:12:58.683 --> 00:13:00.204]  That's a big part of what's behind this.
[00:13:00.244 --> 00:13:02.845]  But of course there are police brutality issues.
[00:13:02.885 --> 00:13:04.667]  There's excessive use of force issues.
[00:13:04.987 --> 00:13:05.827]  They need to be rained down.
[00:13:05.847 --> 00:13:07.729]  We got another story from Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:13:08.089 --> 00:13:10.510]  Cops celebrate on Twitter the Garner decision.
[00:13:10.551 --> 00:13:12.312]  Let's say let's kick some thug.
[00:13:12.612 --> 00:13:15.634]  I'll say but because I can't say what they actually said on the air.
[00:13:16.975 --> 00:13:23.240]  That's what we see them celebrating on Twitter, just as we see some other tweets saying, White Christmas is now racist.
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.782]  This is the kind of insanity that is coming out of this.
[00:13:26.842 --> 00:13:31.366]  The kind of, the way that people are choosing upsides.
[00:13:31.806 --> 00:13:33.467]  And we're going to be talking to Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:13:33.507 --> 00:13:34.928]  Those two stories are both his.
[00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:41.213]  As I said in the first segment, when you look at Twitter, it's kind of like doing a man on the street survey.
[00:13:41.893 --> 00:13:46.617]  You can see some amazing things, and both of those stories that Paul has up there are about Twitter.
[00:13:46.857 --> 00:13:51.981]  He's going to be joining us in the second hour, and of course we want to get your comments as well.
[00:13:52.562 --> 00:13:57.066]  And I don't want to ignore what's going on with the legal system, with the grand jury.
[00:13:57.126 --> 00:13:58.607]  This is not a trial.
[00:13:58.787 --> 00:13:59.648]  Let's understand this.
[00:14:00.068 --> 00:14:03.110]  A grand jury hearing is not a trial.
[00:14:04.291 --> 00:14:08.255]  It has a jury, but it has only the prosecutor.
[00:14:09.201 --> 00:14:14.303]  And as Judge Napolitano said, if you don't get an indictment, it's because you don't want an indictment.
[00:14:14.363 --> 00:14:15.623]  Many people have been saying this.
[00:14:15.963 --> 00:14:19.785]  Of course, there's the expression that everybody uses when they start talking about grand juries.
[00:14:20.085 --> 00:14:23.766]  They say, you can indict a ham sandwich with a grand jury.
[00:14:23.986 --> 00:14:28.868]  It's a very low standard of proof to take it to a trial.
[00:14:30.028 --> 00:14:32.729]  And of course, it's only being controlled by the prosecutor.
[00:14:32.769 --> 00:14:38.271]  So if the prosecutor controls what the jury sees, and it's not an adversarial situation, that's the key thing.
[00:14:39.036 --> 00:14:41.938]  Another key thing is that it is not public.
[00:14:43.559 --> 00:14:50.364]  They're using these grand juries as a beard for not taking these things to trial, for not talking about what's going on there.
[00:14:50.844 --> 00:14:52.305]  They don't want people to see that.
[00:14:53.226 --> 00:15:05.795]  So they do this secretly, as there was an article that was from Breitbart, and I gotta say, it was one of the most sycophantic articles I've ever seen for the system, by Ben Shapiro.
[00:15:07.179 --> 00:15:10.401]  One thing, though, that he has in here that's correct, he says, the charges.
[00:15:10.501 --> 00:15:16.165]  First of all, it's vital to note that nobody knows exactly what the charges filed with the grand jury were against the police officer.
[00:15:16.185 --> 00:15:24.531]  According to ABC News, the charges could have included second-degree manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, felony assault, reckless endangerment.
[00:15:24.851 --> 00:15:25.291]  Yeah, you know what?
[00:15:25.431 --> 00:15:28.153]  We don't even know what they were coming at for charges.
[00:15:28.293 --> 00:15:28.974]  That's the point.
[00:15:29.494 --> 00:15:37.251]  Whenever I've contacted district attorneys to try to get information on cases, I've been told by district attorneys, this is a grand jury situation.
[00:15:37.331 --> 00:15:38.153]  Those records are sealed.
[00:15:38.173 --> 00:15:38.854]  We're not going to put them out.
[00:15:39.608 --> 00:15:46.011]  What the guy did in Ferguson, the prosecutor in Ferguson, did is very, very unusual to make that public.
[00:15:46.511 --> 00:15:48.872]  And of course he did it as a document dump.
[00:15:48.892 --> 00:15:55.654]  Thousands of pages and people are starting to go through that and there's a crowdsourcing investigation to see what happened.
[00:15:55.694 --> 00:16:00.196]  And we, in retrospect, look at that and we find some very amazing things that have come out.
[00:16:00.256 --> 00:16:06.959]  Things like the fact that the police show up and they don't bother to record any of his initial statements.
[00:16:07.059 --> 00:16:08.880]  The officer who was supposed to be doing that said,
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.121]  My recorder was out of batteries.
[00:16:12.402 --> 00:16:13.642]  I didn't have a pen that wrote.
[00:16:13.702 --> 00:16:17.184]  And you know, I just can't remember because there was just so many important things going on.
[00:16:17.365 --> 00:16:20.166]  Wasn't it important to take the statement of the police officer?
[00:16:20.346 --> 00:16:27.430]  And of course, they talk about how whenever they show up on a crime, their assumption is that a police officer has been attacked and is the victim.
[00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:28.311]  That's their assumption.
[00:16:28.671 --> 00:16:31.733]  When they go to a grand jury, that is still the same assumption.
[00:16:32.597 --> 00:16:35.160]  That the police officer is the one who's innocent.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.461]  That's why you don't see indictments.
[00:16:36.902 --> 00:16:41.107]  Let me tell you, grand juries, the last year they took statistics in 2010, they had 162,000 grand jury cases.
[00:16:41.127 --> 00:16:42.588]  You know how many did not return an indictment?
[00:16:42.608 --> 00:16:42.588]  11. 11!
[00:16:50.151 --> 00:17:01.795]  That means when you go before a grand jury, you've got about a 99.9999% chance of getting indicted if they take you before a grand jury because they control, the prosecutor controls the entire process.
[00:17:02.175 --> 00:17:04.856]  If they don't indict you, it's because they don't want to indict you.
[00:17:05.156 --> 00:17:14.099]  When you look at the Darren Wilson thing, any defense attorney that isn't absolutely convinced that the police are on his side is not going to let his client testify at all.
[00:17:14.719 --> 00:17:15.840]  At a grand jury situation.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.340]  He can't even be present.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.901]  The defense attorney can't even be present.
[00:17:19.161 --> 00:17:24.444]  He can't object to anything that the prosecutor is saying to his client.
[00:17:24.524 --> 00:17:26.124]  And everything is going to be on the record.
[00:17:26.144 --> 00:17:28.646]  You're talking about waiving your Miranda rights.
[00:17:29.386 --> 00:17:35.809]  Yet Darren Wilson was allowed to go into this grand jury and talk for over four hours because he wasn't the one on trial.
[00:17:35.829 --> 00:17:37.770]  It was Michael Brown who was the one on trial.
[00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:39.431]  And that's the way they look at this.
[00:17:40.171 --> 00:17:42.852]  So we're going to talk a little bit about that, about people's reactions to it.
[00:17:42.872 --> 00:17:45.632]  We're also going to have Joe Biggs joining us in the next segment.
[00:17:45.672 --> 00:17:53.774]  He's going to join us in the segment before the bottom of the hour because one of the stories that's come up is a story about Michael Hastings has resurfaced again.
[00:17:54.414 --> 00:18:00.176]  We see some emails within the FBI that have been released because of a FOIA request.
[00:18:00.896 --> 00:18:19.521]  And we see that they're talking about how they can put down these conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Michael Hastings and of course that's how Joe Biggs essentially got hooked up with Infowars initially and as part of that investigation because he didn't want to take the mainstream media's lies on that.
[00:18:20.101 --> 00:18:21.862]  He was very angry about what had happened.
[00:18:21.902 --> 00:18:22.642]  He didn't believe it.
[00:18:22.882 --> 00:18:23.642]  We didn't believe it.
[00:18:23.842 --> 00:18:24.583]  We interviewed him.
[00:18:24.623 --> 00:18:28.164]  He made some public comments on some other shows and
[00:18:29.404 --> 00:18:31.545]  You know, Joe wants to get to the bottom of things.
[00:18:31.585 --> 00:18:39.168]  He wants to get to the truth, and he isn't going to take some improbable, impossible explanations for stuff, and neither are we.
[00:18:39.688 --> 00:18:40.709]  That's why Joe is here.
[00:18:40.829 --> 00:18:41.909]  That's why we're here.
[00:18:41.969 --> 00:18:46.731]  So he's going to talk to us for a five-minute segment before the bottom of the break.
[00:18:47.131 --> 00:18:48.132]  We're going to take your calls.
[00:18:49.332 --> 00:18:50.533]  We're going to get your opinion.
[00:18:50.573 --> 00:18:55.056]  I want to know what you think about these situations in New York and in Ferguson.
[00:18:55.076 --> 00:18:57.799]  And of course, we've got a lot of other stories that are coming out.
[00:18:57.819 --> 00:19:03.003]  Before we get to the serious news, though, there's a story that was on Drudge, a couple of stories.
[00:19:04.466 --> 00:19:07.088]  One, about the hundred missing brains in Texas.
[00:19:08.248 --> 00:19:11.871]  We have, at the University of Texas, they had a hundred brains go missing.
[00:19:12.731 --> 00:19:21.917]  And we've done Men on the Streets there, and I was just surprised that it was only a hundred brains that are missing, because whenever I've gone down there to do Men on the Streets, it seems like there's a lot of missing brains.
[00:19:21.937 --> 00:19:29.781]  But these are brains that were actually stored in bottles, and they've now found, they believe that they were destroyed about a decade ago.
[00:19:31.222 --> 00:19:31.663]  Interesting
[00:19:32.762 --> 00:19:34.443]  Another article that was on drudge.
[00:19:35.984 --> 00:19:40.328]  Mice implanted with human brain cells become smarter.
[00:19:41.749 --> 00:19:43.971]  This would be funny if it wasn't so dangerous.
[00:19:44.011 --> 00:19:45.292]  They're creating chimeras.
[00:19:45.312 --> 00:19:47.874]  They're putting human cells in the mice of brains.
[00:19:47.974 --> 00:19:50.576]  And no, this isn't Pinky and the brain.
[00:19:50.596 --> 00:19:52.857]  Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
[00:19:52.957 --> 00:20:01.244]  If you're thinking that this is a way to unleash really dangerous chimeras with this kind of genetic experiments, that's what I'm thinking.
[00:20:01.664 --> 00:20:02.387]  I'm going to be right back.
[00:20:02.487 --> 00:20:06.401]  We're taking your calls and Joe Biggs is going to join us to talk about Michael Hastings.
[00:20:06.441 --> 00:20:07.003]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:15.893]  This holiday season, give the gift that keeps on giving, an in-home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.

[00:20:20.877 --> 00:20:31.885]  Because we live in uncertain, difficult times, what better way to show your love for your family than to buy them a gift that helps them preserve food they can use now or in 25 years.
[00:20:32.165 --> 00:20:36.628]  Go to HarvestRight.com and find out how you can get your in-home freeze dryer.

[00:21:37.301 --> 00:21:38.482]  The Burglar Deterrent.
[00:21:40.043 --> 00:21:40.784]  Hey, Boomer!
[00:21:41.044 --> 00:21:44.365]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[00:21:44.485 --> 00:21:46.046]  Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[00:21:46.146 --> 00:21:47.907]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[00:21:48.107 --> 00:21:53.589]  Mom says it's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[00:21:53.949 --> 00:21:54.690]  I know, right?
[00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:55.710]  You love it, too!
[00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:57.391]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[00:21:57.531 --> 00:21:58.431]  Let's go get some!

[00:23:12.544 --> 00:23:17.769]  The doors lock, bills are paid, you've got a job that keeps the lights on, and a home to call your own.
[00:23:18.049 --> 00:23:20.351]  But what happens when Mother Nature throws a curveball?
[00:23:23.237 --> 00:23:27.162]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time?
[00:23:27.522 --> 00:23:29.024]  Do you even have a plan B?
[00:23:29.625 --> 00:23:32.628]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[00:23:32.929 --> 00:23:34.150]  Children left with no homes.
[00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:35.512]  And no one's coming to help them.
[00:23:35.992 --> 00:23:38.856]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster.
[00:23:39.076 --> 00:23:39.456]  That's right.
[00:24:14.161 --> 00:24:15.554]  Day after day.
[00:24:21.462 --> 00:24:41.768]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, your host today, and with me in studio is Joe Biggs, our reporter who joined us, really got in touch with us because of the Michael Hastings investigation.
[00:24:41.808 --> 00:24:45.009]  We were looking at this, now we've got a story saying that the
[00:24:46.229 --> 00:25:10.587]  Emails that were released as part of a FOIA request show the FBI was working to debunk quote conspiracy theories now of course the entire The term conspiracy theory is something that was created by the FBI to shut down investigations And questions about the official story about the JFK assassination And we had some real questions about this Michael Hastings death from the get-go as we were just talking about
[00:25:11.508 --> 00:25:21.316]  I immediately knew when I looked at this and saw the pictures of the engine down the road at a right angle to where the car had crashed into the tree.
[00:25:22.016 --> 00:25:25.139]  I knew that that didn't happen from it crashing in the tree.
[00:25:25.179 --> 00:25:32.144]  When you crash a car into a tree, the engine is not going to be ejected 150 feet or 200 feet or whatever down the road.
[00:25:32.404 --> 00:25:33.986]  It's going to be captured into the car.
[00:25:34.426 --> 00:25:37.647]  And you could also see that the fire was contained to the front of the car.
[00:25:37.967 --> 00:25:41.068]  It did not involve the rear of the car.
[00:25:41.628 --> 00:25:46.549]  And I did a lot of research about car accidents after that, specifically because of that.
[00:25:46.589 --> 00:25:49.950]  Because it's something of an urban legend that Hollywood has.
[00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:52.531]  We drive a car off a cliff and it immediately explodes.
[00:25:53.211 --> 00:25:57.753]  That doesn't happen unless it's a rear-end collision and the gas tank is ruptured.
[00:25:58.253 --> 00:26:00.613]  And that gas tank, the rear end of that car was still in effect.
[00:26:00.673 --> 00:26:06.675]  Well, even then though, I mean, I've actually shot a car, you know, being in combat and shot gas tanks before and watched them explode.
[00:26:08.596 --> 00:26:11.838]  It blows up and the fire isn't even that bad.
[00:26:11.898 --> 00:26:15.921]  It takes hours to get to the point where what happened in the Hastings crash.
[00:26:16.261 --> 00:26:19.724]  Now you gotta think, he's traveling down, you know, his direction of path.
[00:26:20.204 --> 00:26:21.285]  So there's a few things that happen.
[00:26:21.305 --> 00:26:24.987]  He's traveling, then you see a flash of light, then you see the lights in the vehicle go out.
[00:26:25.768 --> 00:26:27.749]  So that's where there's an explosion.
[00:26:28.009 --> 00:26:28.229]  Yes.
[00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:29.310]  Then you see the flash.
[00:26:29.891 --> 00:26:32.312]  So at that point, that's where the engine's ejected.
[00:26:32.352 --> 00:26:32.793]  Exactly.
[00:26:32.833 --> 00:26:34.774]  And that's what came, eventually we saw that.
[00:26:34.954 --> 00:26:37.396]  But understand, on the very first night, when you see that engine down there, it's like,
[00:26:37.876 --> 00:26:38.537]  Something is wrong.
[00:26:38.617 --> 00:26:39.097]  Exactly.
[00:26:39.337 --> 00:26:49.824]  And we knew that he had made a lot of enemies in Afghanistan, when you were talking to him, and with McChrystal, who is, you know, the guy, the general in charge there.
[00:26:50.064 --> 00:26:52.406]  So we knew he had a lot of powerful enemies.
[00:26:52.446 --> 00:26:58.970]  He was almost kicked off of Air Force One as well, when he was doing the Panic 2012 book about the Obama campaign.
[00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:01.552]  He had a lot of enemies in high places, and this happens.
[00:27:01.872 --> 00:27:06.215]  And then we learned that he was, WikiLeaks said that he was being investigated.
[00:27:06.995 --> 00:27:09.056]  And so it's just one thing after the other.
[00:27:09.076 --> 00:27:11.477]  As you start to look at it, it all starts to unravel.
[00:27:11.737 --> 00:27:15.479]  The physical evidence, then the video that surfaces, then the emails that surface.
[00:27:15.519 --> 00:27:27.425]  But talk about, just before we came back on, just before we had the break, you were talking about the unusual aspects of this FOIA request and the investigation.
[00:27:27.765 --> 00:27:31.747]  So when you submit a FOIA request, there's a few things that happen.
[00:27:31.787 --> 00:27:37.631]  For this one, the original FOIA requests were based off of the media chatter.
[00:27:38.011 --> 00:27:43.514]  Hey, because of the email that I had released and all that, was he being investigated by the FBI?
[00:27:43.794 --> 00:27:49.417]  And maybe that's the reason why he was leaving at such high speeds in the middle of the night or early morning, however you want to look at it.
[00:27:50.778 --> 00:27:58.905]  Well, when you submit a phobia request like that, they're supposed to come back with a confirm or deny as to whether or not they're investigating that individual.
[00:27:59.386 --> 00:28:01.547]  Well, this didn't happen in this case for some reason.
[00:28:01.908 --> 00:28:04.750]  They flat out said no, they were not looking into Michael Hasings.
[00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.372]  So that in itself is very unusual.
[00:28:07.412 --> 00:28:08.714]  That's something that doesn't happen.
[00:28:09.094 --> 00:28:11.236]  It's like I said, it's a confirm or deny.
[00:28:11.776 --> 00:28:13.957]  So, like I said, they flat out said, no, we're not.
[00:28:14.097 --> 00:28:28.241]  But then a year later, they came out and said, well, actually, we were looking at Michael Hastings for what they called controversial reporting in his Rolling Stone article about the Bo Bergdahl, the last American prisoner of war.
[00:28:28.841 --> 00:28:34.283]  So it just goes to show you that they were so quick to say, no, we have nothing to do with this.
[00:28:34.743 --> 00:28:38.924]  And now they're trying to scramble around, apparently, and debunk these conspiracy theories.
[00:28:39.384 --> 00:28:40.885]  Well, we always catch them in a flat out lie.
[00:28:41.567 --> 00:28:42.507]  We always look at this.
[00:28:43.108 --> 00:28:44.649]  We're not conspiracy theorists.
[00:28:45.009 --> 00:28:50.031]  We are skeptics who investigate the official story, or any story that people have.
[00:28:50.311 --> 00:28:54.133]  And we ought to come to these things with a healthy dose of skepticism.
[00:28:54.173 --> 00:28:56.674]  That's really the only kind of objectivity that you can really have.
[00:28:56.714 --> 00:29:06.239]  If you're investigating a murder as a police detective, you don't want to come in and say, well, I was told by his wife that such and such happened, so I'm not going to investigate her.
[00:29:06.799 --> 00:29:08.640]  She's above investigation, yeah.
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.440]  So, I mean, we look at this, we immediately see there's something wrong with it.
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.281]  Then we see things start to surface.
[00:29:13.321 --> 00:29:17.022]  The fact that WikiLeaks says that he had contacted them.
[00:29:17.302 --> 00:29:21.603]  We hear testimony that he was concerned that he was being followed.
[00:29:21.643 --> 00:29:25.504]  He was looking under his car for bombs, his landlady said.
[00:29:26.144 --> 00:29:28.265]  We see a lot of things like this start to surface.
[00:29:28.285 --> 00:29:33.866]  The fact that he sent out communications to people that he worked with and said, I'm gonna be gone for quite some time.
[00:29:33.926 --> 00:29:35.527]  I mean, it was really, really
[00:29:36.387 --> 00:29:38.670]  I mean, I had a deep gut feeling that something was up.
[00:29:39.171 --> 00:29:42.555]  You know, and they come out and they're like, DMT, DMT, this is what it is.
[00:29:42.935 --> 00:29:45.178]  Drug results show that there's DMT in the system.
[00:29:45.738 --> 00:29:51.245]  Okay, look, you know, that has nothing to do with an engine shooting out of a vehicle.
[00:29:51.325 --> 00:29:52.286]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:29:52.306 --> 00:29:52.787]  It was phony.
[00:29:52.927 --> 00:29:53.808]  Thank you so much, Joe.
[00:29:53.828 --> 00:29:56.432]  We're going to be right back with your calls.

[00:31:17.626 --> 00:31:22.390]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:29.575]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:31:31.496 --> 00:31:33.858]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:31:35.563 --> 00:31:37.406]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:31:37.486 --> 00:31:43.876]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:31:44.597 --> 00:31:47.662]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:31:49.636 --> 00:31:51.518]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:31:51.778 --> 00:31:53.299]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:56.123]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[00:32:08.156 --> 00:32:08.916]  Others don't.
[00:32:10.339 --> 00:32:19.865]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[00:32:20.005 --> 00:32:29.750]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:32.852]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body.
[00:32:33.052 --> 00:32:33.673]  I think so.
[00:32:48.189 --> 00:32:48.549]  We're good.
[00:33:30.822 --> 00:33:35.948]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:33:35.968 --> 00:33:37.470]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:45.916 --> 00:33:49.537]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Thursday, December 4th, 2014.
[00:33:49.637 --> 00:33:53.779]  We're going to be joined in the next hour, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:33:54.159 --> 00:33:59.561]  He's been looking at reactions to the Eric Garner non-indictment that didn't happen.
[00:33:59.601 --> 00:34:12.486]  The police officer was not indicted for the death of Eric Garner, the man who was choked to death or who they caused to have a heart attack because he was selling single cigarettes on the sidewalk.
[00:34:13.186 --> 00:34:23.373]  Something that New York City is very serious about, getting their taxes and of course harassing petty crime that they can get revenue out of letting the serious crime go.
[00:34:23.413 --> 00:34:31.518]  That was a story of Adrian Schoolcraft, a New York City cop, and I talked about what he did recording the police for a couple years.
[00:34:31.978 --> 00:34:34.099]  Let me tell you what they did when they found out about it.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:39.022]  As we see so often, it's not the person who exposes...
[00:34:40.791 --> 00:34:42.973]  Illegal activity exposed by a whistleblower.
[00:34:43.554 --> 00:34:47.858]  They don't arrest the people who are conducting the illegal activity, as we see over and over again.
[00:34:47.918 --> 00:34:49.739]  No, they arrest the whistleblower.
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:52.982]  In this case, they came to his apartment.
[00:34:53.162 --> 00:34:56.886]  I think it was the second in command at the New York City Police Department.
[00:34:57.907 --> 00:35:01.190]  They told him they were very concerned that he seemed suicidal.
[00:35:02.316 --> 00:35:07.147]  And for his own protection, they were going to put him in an insane asylum.
[00:35:07.809 --> 00:35:08.691]  And he recorded this.
[00:35:08.751 --> 00:35:11.177]  He was wired in his own apartment recording that.
[00:35:12.126 --> 00:35:14.267]  And they of course knew that he'd been recording them.
[00:35:14.287 --> 00:35:15.268]  So they found that recording.
[00:35:15.288 --> 00:35:18.149]  What they didn't find was the recorder that he'd put on the shelf.
[00:35:18.209 --> 00:35:19.470]  He had actually a second one.
[00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:22.371]  His father was a retired cop.
[00:35:23.171 --> 00:35:31.895]  And when he went missing, because they took him and put him into an insane asylum, he was there for several days before his father, the retired cop, was able to find him.
[00:35:32.636 --> 00:35:34.997]  He began a large lawsuit in the city of New York.
[00:35:35.977 --> 00:35:50.156]  And he was a key witness in the stop-and-frisk cases and hearings that were going on where the New York City Police Department would just stop people on the street and frisk them for no apparent reason, for no probable cause.
[00:35:50.957 --> 00:35:53.140]  Now we're going to look at some good cops who've had some
[00:35:54.201 --> 00:35:59.265]  Besides Adrian Schoolcraft, we've had several cops actually file suit in Illinois.
[00:35:59.305 --> 00:36:00.426]  We're going to talk about that story.
[00:36:01.187 --> 00:36:07.052]  Saying that their police department was essentially telling them to do the same thing that the New York City Police Department was.
[00:36:07.572 --> 00:36:11.856]  Just go out and arrest people to get your quotas up.
[00:36:12.156 --> 00:36:15.559]  And they said, we don't want to arrest people without probable cause.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.140]  So we're going to talk about that.
[00:36:17.961 --> 00:36:24.804]  I also want to get your reactions to things, and of course we're going to have, as I said, Paul Joseph Watson joining us in the next hour.
[00:36:25.645 --> 00:36:32.088]  Before I go to your calls, I'll let you know about the specials that we have here at the InfoWars store.
[00:36:32.468 --> 00:36:33.809]  These are Christmas specials.
[00:36:34.569 --> 00:36:36.250]  We have free shipping storewide.
[00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:42.013]  We have Prison Planet membership that was $60 is now down to $29.95 a year.
[00:36:42.073 --> 00:36:43.954]  That's seven months for free.
[00:36:43.974 --> 00:36:45.595]  That's only two and a half dollars a month
[00:36:46.275 --> 00:36:48.556]  And you can share that with up to 20 other friends.
[00:36:48.916 --> 00:36:50.476]  In other words, they break it down here.
[00:36:50.516 --> 00:36:53.097]  That would be 12 cents a person per month.
[00:36:53.677 --> 00:36:56.178]  It's incredibly cheap, but it helps to support our operation.
[00:36:56.218 --> 00:37:02.800]  That's where you usually find me, Leanne McAdoo, Jakari Jackson, Derrick McBrain, Rob Dew, the others on air.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:07.242]  That's where we do the nightly news Monday through Friday at 7 central, 8 p.m.

[00:37:51.687 --> 00:37:59.852]  Now I want to go to some of your calls, but first I want to just hit some of the high points, some of the headlines of some of the other articles we're going to talk about later on in the show.
[00:37:59.892 --> 00:38:07.716]  We have Texas has filed as part of a 17 state lawsuit challenging Obama's unconstitutional amnesty executive action.
[00:38:07.776 --> 00:38:12.439]  And of course our governor-elect is the current Attorney General, Greg Abbott.
[00:38:12.879 --> 00:38:21.230]  He has sued the federal government over a lot of illegal activity and it's been a target-rich environment actually under the Obama administration.
[00:38:21.731 --> 00:38:22.972]  He's leading that lawsuit.
[00:38:24.145 --> 00:38:27.309]  And Texas is, so it'll be interesting to see what happens with that.
[00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:42.966]  Also, Obama, he got caught a couple of days ago saying, as he was getting heckled, he was trying to pull it back, he obviously got flustered, and he said to the demonstrators who were heckling him because he hadn't done enough for illegal aliens, he goes, hey, I changed the law for y'all.
[00:38:43.706 --> 00:38:45.328]  I changed the law for you.
[00:38:45.588 --> 00:38:45.909]  Get that?
[00:38:46.369 --> 00:38:47.591]  I changed the law.
[00:38:48.452 --> 00:38:51.215]  It said 22 times, hey, we don't live in a dictatorship.
[00:38:51.535 --> 00:38:52.376]  We've got a constitution.
[00:38:52.416 --> 00:38:54.098]  I just can't arbitrarily change the law.
[00:38:54.118 --> 00:38:55.580]  That's not how the country works.
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:55.980]  But then...
[00:38:56.894 --> 00:39:00.676]  When he's under pressure with some hecklers, he said, hey, I changed the law for you.
[00:39:00.716 --> 00:39:02.456]  Now he's trying to walk that back.
[00:39:02.496 --> 00:39:09.800]  He says, well, you know, he was just speaking colloquially when he admitted to violating the Constitution, acting as a dictator.
[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:14.322]  This is something that has been building under Republicans as well as Democrats.
[00:39:14.362 --> 00:39:20.744]  And I say Republicans are even more guilty about it because they keep telling us that they're going to do something about it.
[00:39:21.205 --> 00:39:25.687]  And their opposition lasted all of five minutes after the election, as they're pointing out yesterday.
[00:39:26.994 --> 00:39:28.215]  They didn't do anything about it.
[00:39:28.655 --> 00:39:37.040]  Yet, the only thing they did when they came back after the election before they left again for Thanksgiving holidays, was to pass the Keystone Pipeline for the ninth time.
[00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:40.262]  And I've probably said that on air nine times, and I'll keep saying it.
[00:39:40.682 --> 00:39:44.965]  Because they know the Keystone Pipeline legislation they passed was never going to go past the Senate.
[00:39:45.465 --> 00:39:56.016]  And of course the President would have vetoed it, and yet they tell us they can't do an impeachment for all the criminal, illegal activities of the Obama administration.
[00:39:56.357 --> 00:39:57.618]  All they need is one of them.
[00:39:57.718 --> 00:40:04.706]  All they need is using the IRS against political enemies, doing it at a scale and a scope that Richard Nixon
[00:40:05.306 --> 00:40:08.847]  Never even conceived of from what we can see in the impeachment articles there.
[00:40:08.887 --> 00:40:13.348]  He wasn't accused that I'm sure he probably could have conceived of it He had some pretty dark thoughts.
[00:40:13.428 --> 00:40:25.631]  I'm sure but He never did anything the scope and the scale of what Obama has done and of course he has people all the way down The government covering that up with the Justice Department
[00:40:26.462 --> 00:40:31.825]  I talked about whistleblowers, not going to jail when the criminals don't.
[00:40:32.325 --> 00:40:33.665]  We had a great interview last night.
[00:40:33.685 --> 00:40:34.626]  I'm not sure when it's going to air.
[00:40:34.646 --> 00:40:41.969]  It's either going to air tomorrow or Monday, because if it airs tomorrow, it's going to go on YouTube on Saturday.
[00:40:42.009 --> 00:40:45.251]  That's really a bad time to release an important interview like this.
[00:40:45.951 --> 00:40:51.354]  But I talked to a fellow who was on the ground floor with Savings and Loan Investigations, a Greg Morse.
[00:40:52.281 --> 00:40:58.785]  He did investigations about the banking scandal, found the largest tax evasion case in history.
[00:40:58.825 --> 00:41:00.246]  And this is not tax avoidance.
[00:41:00.747 --> 00:41:02.108]  This is tax evasion.
[00:41:02.548 --> 00:41:03.709]  Criminal tax evasion.
[00:41:04.589 --> 00:41:10.313]  Now, he also found, of course, the largest securities fraud situation.
[00:41:10.333 --> 00:41:13.255]  He's reported both of those to the IRS, to the SEC.
[00:41:13.295 --> 00:41:16.918]  Doesn't apparently appear to be any interest from them, not surprisingly.
[00:41:17.638 --> 00:41:21.181]  And of course, the Justice Department doesn't think they have any jurisdiction in that.
[00:41:22.034 --> 00:41:37.662]  It's interesting because the biggest IRS whistleblower, who got eventually a $104 million dollar whistleblower fee for exposing tax evasion from the IRS, before he got that, he spent two or three years in jail.
[00:41:38.382 --> 00:41:44.427]  He reported tax evasion using the Swiss bank UBS and the Swiss banking system in general.
[00:41:44.467 --> 00:41:51.312]  It caused a massive change in tax issues and it caused them to get a lot of revenue.
[00:41:51.892 --> 00:41:59.117]  But before they treated him as a whistleblower, the Department of Justice, Eric Holder's Department of Justice, sent him to jail.
[00:41:59.958 --> 00:42:03.919]  Yeah, he exposed criminal activity and only the whistleblower goes to jail.
[00:42:04.099 --> 00:42:05.820]  None of the bankers ever went to jail.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:13.342]  Even after they completed the investigation, found these guys guilty, none of the rich and powerful, none of the criminal bankers did it.
[00:42:13.562 --> 00:42:19.884]  Now this interview is interesting because this interview actually is not just a historical expose of wrongdoing.
[00:42:20.044 --> 00:42:22.645]  It shows what is actually still going on.
[00:42:22.925 --> 00:42:26.126]  How they are using this money into
[00:42:27.046 --> 00:42:35.275]  Channeling an end to black operations that are going to be funding taking down other governments, funding terrorism, funding drugs, that sort of thing.
[00:42:35.435 --> 00:42:48.248]  It's really like the Iran-Contra scandal, except instead of being funded by illegal weapon sales to Iran, instead of being funded by crack cocaine, their black operations are being funded by stealing your mortgage.
[00:42:48.891 --> 00:42:58.099]  And the thing I like about the interview is that he gives you something to do for free that I think could have a big impact on this.
[00:42:58.119 --> 00:42:58.779]  So look for that interview.
[00:42:58.799 --> 00:43:00.461]  It's going to be coming up in the next couple of days.
[00:43:01.021 --> 00:43:07.486]  Now I want to go to your calls, but as I said, I wanted to cover just briefly some of the other headlines that are here besides the amnesty issue.
[00:43:07.506 --> 00:43:13.792]  We've also got a story we're going to talk about later about the CPS confiscating children after a family chooses home birth.
[00:43:14.352 --> 00:43:17.635]  We also have an anti-fluoride campaign going on in Dallas.
[00:43:17.695 --> 00:43:20.258]  I like the slogan, get the F out of Dallas.
[00:43:21.078 --> 00:43:23.621]  This is something we interviewed again on the Nightly News.
[00:43:23.821 --> 00:43:31.008]  Leanne McAdoo talked to the person who was doing an Indiegogo campaign to fund the advertising to educate people about fluoride.
[00:43:31.688 --> 00:43:32.049]  And listen.
[00:43:33.294 --> 00:43:39.960]  If fluoride is medication that is safe and effective, then why would you put it in the water supply?
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:52.009]  If you don't control the dosage of something that is safe and effective in a controlled dosage, if you don't have any control over the dosage, if you're dumping it in the water supply, you don't have any control over the dosage that people are getting.
[00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:56.633]  A baby is going to get the same dosage that a fully grown man will get.
[00:43:57.274 --> 00:43:58.215]  You see the problem there?
[00:43:59.212 --> 00:44:05.216]  If it's safe and effective to start with, once you dump it into the water supply, it is no longer safe and effective.
[00:44:05.756 --> 00:44:10.539]  And they point out, of course, that it is not safe and effective, as they point out in the ad campaign.
[00:44:10.879 --> 00:44:14.161]  They say, why do people have to wear hazmat suits when they handle fluoride?
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:17.282]  It's so corrosive, it eats through concrete.
[00:44:17.662 --> 00:44:18.222]  We showed that.
[00:44:18.282 --> 00:44:22.286]  We went to the Austin Power, the Austin Water Supply.
[00:44:22.366 --> 00:44:29.231]  We actually took some, the people at, I wasn't with Infowars at the time, but they took video of the corrosion on the pipes.
[00:44:29.271 --> 00:44:33.955]  They took video of the fact that it was a class 4 toxin out of 4 classes.
[00:44:34.295 --> 00:44:41.741]  They say, if you're warned to call poison control when you swallow your toothpaste, why is it still added to the water that we drink, that we cook with, that we shower with?
[00:44:42.361 --> 00:44:46.706]  And why are we spending, in Dallas alone, a million dollars to do this?
[00:44:46.827 --> 00:44:57.880]  And we've had study after study from Harvard and other places showing that it lowers IQ, that it increases the risk of cancer, yet we're spending millions of dollars to get rid of corporate toxic waste.
[00:44:58.641 --> 00:45:00.922]  That's how we're used by the big corporations.
[00:45:01.242 --> 00:45:10.265]  They would have to pay a lot of money to get rid of this toxic waste, or they can sell it to us for a lot of money and have us drink it.
[00:45:10.845 --> 00:45:11.566]  That's what they're doing.
[00:45:12.046 --> 00:45:18.468]  We also have some reactions from Giuliani and from Rand Paul, but I want to get your reactions right now.
[00:45:18.508 --> 00:45:20.049]  We've got some callers that are on the line.
[00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:23.070]  Let's go to Kyle in Utah.
[00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:23.350]  Kyle?
[00:45:25.771 --> 00:45:26.211]  Hello, Kyle.
[00:45:26.991 --> 00:45:28.232]  Hello Dave, how are you doing?
[00:45:28.432 --> 00:45:28.973]  Doing good.
[00:45:29.573 --> 00:45:30.494]  I'll get right to the point.
[00:45:31.495 --> 00:45:39.642]  I'm actually calling about a different article I think was linked on Drudge about the Utah Transfer of Public Land Act.
[00:45:40.863 --> 00:45:42.044]  And Rep.
[00:45:42.164 --> 00:45:53.994]  Ivory said that the deadline, I guess the deadline's coming up is December 31st, and that they're going to move forward and use all the resources at our disposal.
[00:45:56.125 --> 00:45:59.889]  What is your take on this?
[00:45:59.909 --> 00:46:02.591]  I know that Arizona passed a similar act.
[00:46:02.651 --> 00:46:05.074]  Is this the first time this is going to be attempted?
[00:46:06.175 --> 00:46:11.800]  And what do you think these resources... They're clearly moving the ball here on this.
[00:46:14.463 --> 00:46:22.905]  Part of the problem out west, and this is an issue at the Bundy Ranch, we had people who were from local governments in Utah that had shown up to talk about this very issue.
[00:46:22.925 --> 00:46:24.826]  There were several issues going on at the Bundy Ranch.
[00:46:25.126 --> 00:46:29.907]  What got us involved was, again, the excessive use of force, the police brutality.
[00:46:30.367 --> 00:46:40.990]  But there was also an underlying issue that caused this conflict in the first place, and that was the fact that most of the land is owned out west by the federal government.
[00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:48.935]  And what they were doing with the land, what Harry Reid and others do with the land is they're now putting it to investment use.
[00:46:49.035 --> 00:47:04.966]  Telling people that they have to protect the desert tortoise specifically in Nevada and yet setting up a lot of projects, natural resource exploration in terms of mining, working with crony capitalism partners in terms of setting up large solar systems.
[00:47:05.346 --> 00:47:06.727]  So this is where it's happening.
[00:47:06.747 --> 00:47:10.890]  They're treating this public land and they're going to treat it as their personal fiefdom.
[00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:11.630]  They will use it.
[00:47:12.111 --> 00:47:13.692]  And they will keep you off of it.
[00:47:30.253 --> 00:47:35.298]  And they said, when they come in, they're going to do what they've done in every other park.
[00:47:35.438 --> 00:47:38.300]  And I saw this in September when I went to Yellowstone.
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:47.369]  They brag about the fact that they only give you access to 1% of the park, that the 99% of the park is off access to you.
[00:47:47.809 --> 00:47:49.430]  And they said, this is what's going to happen to the public.
[00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:50.571]  It's not going to be public land.
[00:47:51.272 --> 00:47:58.916]  They are going to put a couple of trails in it, put some trails around the perimeter of it, and it will be off-limit to the public.
[00:47:59.056 --> 00:48:01.378]  But they will use it for their own purposes.
[00:48:01.438 --> 00:48:09.142]  They will use it for their corrupt games that they play with crony capitalists that they can trade influence and trade projects with.
[00:48:09.602 --> 00:48:14.645]  It's a very serious thing and we need to roll this back and look at how we got into that situation.
[00:48:15.045 --> 00:48:17.547]  Why wasn't that land turned over
[00:48:18.107 --> 00:48:19.668]  To the people as it should have been.
[00:48:19.708 --> 00:48:21.169]  Why was it kept by the federal government?
[00:48:21.189 --> 00:48:24.551]  Because places like Utah and other states that were out west, they were originally territories.
[00:48:24.571 --> 00:48:28.674]  As they became states, that land should have been turned over to the people.
[00:48:29.174 --> 00:48:30.335]  It wasn't turned over to the people.
[00:48:30.395 --> 00:48:33.838]  The federal government retained ownership and now we see what they're doing.
[00:48:34.318 --> 00:48:35.479]  They're not good stewards.
[00:48:35.519 --> 00:48:47.507]  At the same time in Nevada that they were talking about protecting the desert tortoise, of course, they had, I think it was 1,200 of them that they had euthanized at their center because they didn't have the funds to feed them or whatever their excuse was.
[00:48:48.267 --> 00:48:56.313]  But they're using these issues of endangered species to, in many cases, that's the basis on which they want to do this.
[00:48:56.333 --> 00:48:57.613]  But yeah, it's a very serious issue.
[00:48:57.633 --> 00:49:05.739]  It is a big grab of authority, just as we see the FCC trying to extend its authority and ushering in Internet censorship.
[00:49:05.779 --> 00:49:09.201]  And of course, that's one of the articles we're going to talk to Paul Joseph Watson about in the next hour.
[00:49:09.261 --> 00:49:13.204]  We see Obama official is meeting with a Chinese Internet censorship czar.
[00:49:13.224 --> 00:49:17.887]  There's a lot of ways that we see the federal government moving to take control of the Internet.
[00:49:18.287 --> 00:49:28.152]  In the same way that the EPA or the Bureau of Land Management is trying to take control of the land out west and exercise a more rigid, exclusive control.
[00:49:28.192 --> 00:49:30.733]  That, of course, it all plays into Agenda 21.
[00:49:30.793 --> 00:49:31.853]  That's the endgame.
[00:49:31.893 --> 00:49:38.696]  If you want to know where all this is headed, it means that they're going to concentrate all of us into very small areas, high concentration areas.
[00:49:38.956 --> 00:49:41.778]  We will not be allowed into those areas whatsoever.
[00:49:41.998 --> 00:49:45.199]  Let's move on to, we've got somebody with us, an ex-cop in Maryland.
[00:49:45.239 --> 00:49:46.160]  Let's talk to him.
[00:49:49.335 --> 00:49:49.475]  Hi.
[00:49:49.595 --> 00:49:49.775]  Hi.
[00:49:49.795 --> 00:49:52.596]  Hello, can you hear me?
[00:49:52.616 --> 00:49:53.417]  Yes, I can hear you.
[00:49:53.437 --> 00:49:54.917]  Go ahead.
[00:49:54.957 --> 00:49:56.618]  Yes, I am.
[00:49:56.638 --> 00:50:06.242]  Thank you for taking my call, and I'll try to keep it brief, but I really, really appreciate what you guys are doing.
[00:50:06.442 --> 00:50:08.442]  I'm an ex-cop from Maryland.
[00:50:10.755 --> 00:50:21.359]  And I just wanted to talk about the outrageous police conduct.
[00:50:21.719 --> 00:50:29.903]  It has gotten so bad that, and I think it is getting a little worse now.
[00:50:30.063 --> 00:50:34.204]  I was an ex-cop in the 80s, in the late 80s.
[00:50:34.224 --> 00:50:38.526]  And the reason why I got out, I spent like two years in.
[00:50:39.255 --> 00:50:46.501]  The reason why I got out is because I saw so much abuse of regular citizens not doing anything wrong.
[00:50:47.162 --> 00:50:52.947]  There is a culture among many police.
[00:50:53.227 --> 00:50:53.988]  Hang on, hang on.
[00:50:54.028 --> 00:50:56.030]  We gotta, I want you to hang on through the break.
[00:50:56.050 --> 00:50:56.750]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:56.770 --> 00:50:57.831]  We gotta take a commercial break.
[00:50:57.851 --> 00:50:59.833]  We're gonna be talking this is the next cop in Maryland.
[00:50:59.853 --> 00:51:02.375]  I want to get your take on and reaction to some of these things.
[00:51:02.776 --> 00:51:06.179]  We'll be right back with your calls and Paul Joseph Watson will be joining us in the next hour.
[00:51:11.636 --> 00:51:15.599]  Yes, family and friends are gathering to give gifts and wish health and security.
[00:51:15.839 --> 00:51:20.203]  But why not enhance cell phone and wireless device security all year with Block-It Pocket?

[00:52:09.801 --> 00:52:14.663]  Did you know by age 50, half of all men have an enlarged prostate?
[00:52:15.123 --> 00:52:21.525]  This means more urges to urinate, longer bathroom trips, waking at night to urinate, or issues with sex.

[00:53:34.895 --> 00:53:38.617]  And that saves time and money in filter replacements that other water filters require.

[00:54:31.983 --> 00:54:33.424]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:33.444 --> 00:54:34.565]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[00:54:34.605 --> 00:54:37.327]  We're going to be joined by Paul Joseph Watson in the next hour.
[00:54:37.828 --> 00:54:39.749]  Also by talk show host Lionel.
[00:54:39.789 --> 00:54:44.913]  It'll be interesting to talk to him because he is a lawyer, a former prosecutor and defense attorney.
[00:54:45.253 --> 00:54:50.417]  I want to talk to him about some of the issues involved in these grand juries as well as he's in New York.
[00:54:50.477 --> 00:54:51.678]  I want to see what he's
[00:54:52.799 --> 00:54:57.984]  Seeing the last day or so in terms of reactions, but he'll be with us as well as Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:54:58.024 --> 00:54:59.826]  Right now, we're getting your reactions.
[00:54:59.886 --> 00:55:05.311]  Of course, we'll take some more calls after Lionel leaves us in the third hour when I'm here with Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:55:05.691 --> 00:55:11.997]  We'll take some more of your calls, but I was talking before the break to an ex-cop from Maryland who called in.
[00:55:12.017 --> 00:55:17.302]  I want to get back to his phone call, but just want to point out up on the Drudge Report right now, the top story, New Dawn.
[00:55:17.882 --> 00:55:24.348]  China is now the world's biggest economy, and as I point out, this is the first time this has happened since U.S.
[00:55:24.488 --> 00:55:25.809]  Grant was president.
[00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:29.232]  That disparity is going to continue to grow.
[00:55:29.993 --> 00:55:33.216]  Just recently Obama went to China, and what did he agree to?
[00:55:33.816 --> 00:55:40.702]  Well, he agreed to decline energy output in the United States by 26% over the next 11 years.
[00:55:41.263 --> 00:55:44.366]  China, meanwhile, will not decline, but will cap.
[00:55:45.137 --> 00:55:47.980]  Their energy output in 16 years.
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:50.362]  They will be allowed to continue to grow.
[00:55:50.882 --> 00:55:51.663]  There's no restraints.
[00:55:51.703 --> 00:55:53.925]  Nobody is worried about global warming, it seems.
[00:55:54.406 --> 00:56:01.292]  If the global warming, if the global pollution is coming from China, they're not concerned about that.
[00:56:01.532 --> 00:56:10.440]  It's only American factories, American power plants, American automobiles that can contribute to global pollution.
[00:56:11.201 --> 00:56:12.742]  You understand how this is being used?
[00:56:13.003 --> 00:56:14.464]  The same way they're using racism.
[00:56:14.504 --> 00:56:19.348]  Of course, we're going to talk to Paul Joseph Watson about how they're manufacturing racism.
[00:56:19.368 --> 00:56:25.753]  I guess that's about the only thing we're manufacturing anymore in this country, is government regulations and racism.
[00:56:26.233 --> 00:56:28.275]  But let's go back to XCOP in Maryland.
[00:56:28.835 --> 00:56:29.956]  We had to go to a break.
[00:56:30.076 --> 00:56:38.503]  XCOP, you said you were there for two years and you left because you were concerned about the excessive use of force that you saw?
[00:56:40.001 --> 00:56:42.003]  Yes, Mr. Knight.
[00:56:42.864 --> 00:56:47.167]  I saw a lot of abuse.
[00:56:49.009 --> 00:56:53.012]  By the way, I like the way you said, manufactured racism.
[00:56:53.472 --> 00:56:54.813]  That is so true.
[00:56:55.454 --> 00:56:58.096]  I happen to be African American.
[00:56:59.017 --> 00:56:59.938]  And I tell you, man,
[00:57:00.618 --> 00:57:16.392]  From a perspective of African-American, ex-police, more conservative, on the conservative side, I get flack from, believe me, a lot of African-Americans.
[00:57:17.814 --> 00:57:21.837]  More African-Americans than, per se, white people.
[00:57:23.959 --> 00:57:38.199]  Let me ask you a question about that, because Giuliani, when he was on making his remarks, one of the things that he pointed out, he says, if I recall, there was an African American sergeant on the scene when Eric Garner was killed, in charge of the entire situation, and never did anything to stop.
[00:57:39.350 --> 00:57:48.698]  You know, that's what I've been saying when I look at Obama saying we're going to get, we're going to get racial quotas here, we're going to stop racial profiling, but we're going to get more black police.
[00:57:48.718 --> 00:57:49.999]  Do you think that's going to solve the problem?
[00:57:50.039 --> 00:57:58.586]  Are they going to see themselves, are they going to identify with the black community, or are they going to identify as being part of the blue community, in your opinion?
[00:58:05.242 --> 00:58:16.447]  I've seen a lot of black police officers do a lot of heinous things against black people too.
[00:58:16.847 --> 00:58:20.849]  So I don't think that's going to do a lot of things.
[00:58:21.829 --> 00:58:33.314]  I think that it's a systemic problem in that when police are allowed to, and I'm an ex-cop,
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:37.342]  Hang on.
[00:58:37.462 --> 00:58:38.443]  Stay with me right after the break.
[00:58:38.463 --> 00:58:39.364]  We're going to take a quick break.
[00:58:39.384 --> 00:58:40.244]  We're going to be right back.
[00:58:40.324 --> 00:58:43.848]  I want to get a little bit more from you, but I do want to get to some other callers that we've got on the line.
[00:58:44.168 --> 00:58:47.291]  We're also going to have Paul Joseph Watson joining us and Lionel.
[00:58:47.331 --> 00:58:47.671]  Stay with us.
[00:58:47.691 --> 00:58:48.272]  We'll be right back.

[01:00:17.698 --> 01:00:18.738]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:19.478 --> 01:00:20.579]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:21.239 --> 01:00:22.039]  You want answers?
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:23.700]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:28.002]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:28.542 --> 01:00:32.604]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:34.778 --> 01:00:35.938]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:36.018 --> 01:00:37.158]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[01:00:37.179 --> 01:00:45.520]  We're going to be joined in the next segment by Paul Joseph Watson from London, as well as by Lionel, the talk show host who comes out of New York.
[01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:49.981]  He also has a background in law, so we're going to talk to him about some of these grand jury indictments.
[01:00:50.361 --> 01:00:53.242]  Right now I've got a caller who called in, an ex-cop from Maryland.
[01:00:54.122 --> 01:00:58.783]  As we were just talking before we had to go to break, you were saying that you're a black officer.
[01:00:58.823 --> 01:01:02.364]  You've seen a lot of black officers abusing
[01:01:04.355 --> 01:01:06.336]  People and the general public.
[01:01:07.416 --> 01:01:11.058]  And as I was reading this quote from Giuliani, that's essentially what he said.
[01:01:11.118 --> 01:01:17.160]  He said there was an African-American sergeant on the scene and the entire time did not do anything to stop.
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:20.582]  So obviously he didn't have a problem with what was going on.
[01:01:21.102 --> 01:01:23.503]  I think it boils down to training.
[01:01:23.723 --> 01:01:25.264]  You were a cop back in the 80s, you said.
[01:01:25.964 --> 01:01:30.866]  Don't you get a sense that they're being trained in a very different way than people were 30 years ago?
[01:01:32.205 --> 01:01:33.265]  Yes, definitely.
[01:01:34.165 --> 01:01:41.307]  And the caliber of police officers has devolved into something really bizarre.
[01:01:41.687 --> 01:01:56.190]  But some of the things that I saw, some of the things that I heard were from other police officers, you're a new pair of shoes speaking to the residents in a poor urban area where I work.
[01:01:57.251 --> 01:01:58.311]  They would tell the people,
[01:01:59.733 --> 01:02:01.634]  You're just a new pair of shoes for my kid.
[01:02:02.114 --> 01:02:21.523]  Because what happens is that if you make an arrest and hearing this, hearing this just made me irate because I started college last in my junior year and then joined the police department thinking that I was going to do like a greater good because I think I'm a pretty good guy.
[01:02:21.583 --> 01:02:26.025]  But hearing this was just so bizarre.
[01:02:26.065 --> 01:02:27.005]  You're a new pair of shoes.
[01:02:27.045 --> 01:02:28.926]  So then if I arrest you,
[01:02:30.345 --> 01:02:38.427]  Then I'm going to get an extra $40, $50, $60 back then to take care of my family.
[01:02:38.487 --> 01:02:42.188]  So what do you consider people just a source of revenue?
[01:02:42.748 --> 01:02:46.409]  And then I tried to stop it.
[01:02:46.629 --> 01:02:51.090]  I tried as a rookie cop coming straight out of the police academy.
[01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:54.331]  I tried to stop it in a naive way.
[01:02:55.211 --> 01:02:57.032]  And what I got?
[01:02:57.752 --> 01:02:58.352]  What I got?
[01:03:00.993 --> 01:03:05.077]  In the inner city, you're supposed to have backup.
[01:03:06.118 --> 01:03:06.959]  Oh, like SuperGo.
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:08.501]  Did they set you up?
[01:03:09.642 --> 01:03:10.203]  Exactly.
[01:03:10.463 --> 01:03:12.445]  You're supposed to have backup within 10 seconds.
[01:03:12.465 --> 01:03:13.346]  15 seconds, Matt.
[01:03:15.581 --> 01:03:21.648]  What I found out, it was taking 30 seconds, 45 seconds, and these are, some of the guys are like bad.
[01:03:21.668 --> 01:03:29.316]  I mean, you know, you have four guys up on a, you know, selling drugs, and a lot of them have berettas and stuff on, and you call for backup, your backup doesn't come.
[01:03:29.376 --> 01:03:30.036]  So what do you do?
[01:03:30.597 --> 01:03:30.797]  Yeah.
[01:03:31.318 --> 01:03:33.320]  Well, you're familiar with the Serpico story, right?
[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:36.123]  You've seen the movie, probably, with Al Pacino?
[01:03:37.245 --> 01:03:37.546]  Yes, sir.
[01:03:52.125 --> 01:03:52.625]  We're good to go.
[01:04:18.809 --> 01:04:20.530]  And that was a rookie.
[01:04:20.550 --> 01:04:22.871]  The 12-year-old had a BB gun.
[01:04:23.011 --> 01:04:26.132]  Somebody called it in because this guy was playing around with a BB gun.
[01:04:26.412 --> 01:04:29.034]  I saw the pictures of him pointing the BB gun around.
[01:04:29.394 --> 01:04:34.236]  It reminded me of a Christmas story where Ralphie gets his BB gun.
[01:04:34.436 --> 01:04:36.117]  I did that kind of stuff when I was a kid.
[01:04:36.997 --> 01:04:41.380]  I had guns, toy guns, that I was shooting at imaginary villains with.
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:44.101]  I didn't expect and shouldn't have been shot dead by the cops.
[01:04:44.141 --> 01:04:50.485]  And in this particular case, you got, there's video that exists, you see the cop car pull up, and the rookie jumps out.
[01:04:50.585 --> 01:04:52.706]  And within one second, he shot that kid dead.
[01:04:52.746 --> 01:04:57.709]  And that kid wasn't pointing a gun at him, wasn't any threat to him, and it was a toy gun.
[01:04:58.029 --> 01:04:59.490]  Thank you so much for calling us.
[01:04:59.550 --> 01:05:00.411]  We're going to be right back.
[01:05:00.451 --> 01:05:02.052]  We're going to have Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:05:02.352 --> 01:05:07.483]  And we're going to have Lionel, the talk show host in New York, as well as a former lawyer.
[01:05:07.503 --> 01:05:09.106]  We're going to talk to him about what's going on.
[01:05:09.487 --> 01:05:09.867]  Stay with us.
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:14.181]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:05:14.342 --> 01:05:18.303]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:18.623 --> 01:05:20.084]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:05:20.404 --> 01:05:27.987]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:05:28.267 --> 01:05:29.108]  But for how long?

[01:06:12.098 --> 01:06:15.880]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:20.963]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[01:06:21.103 --> 01:06:27.886]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[01:06:28.406 --> 01:06:37.471]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:06:37.691 --> 01:06:43.155]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.

[01:08:07.091 --> 01:08:14.957]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:14.977 --> 01:08:18.340]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:24.514 --> 01:08:28.758]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show and this live December 4, 2014 edition.
[01:08:28.778 --> 01:08:29.979]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[01:08:30.659 --> 01:08:33.322]  Joining us this hour, joining us right now, is Lionel.
[01:08:33.422 --> 01:08:40.107]  He's a renaissance lawyer, news decoder, First Amendment sentry, and a New York-based television legal analyst.
[01:08:40.187 --> 01:08:46.993]  And so, I want to see what he's seeing there on the ground, and also talk to him about what's going on with grand juries.
[01:08:47.493 --> 01:08:49.315]  Kind of fill us in a little bit about how that works.
[01:08:49.936 --> 01:08:51.137]  Lionel, thank you for joining us.
[01:08:51.997 --> 01:08:52.458]  Thank you, sir.
[01:08:53.342 --> 01:08:54.544]  Now, you're based in New York.
[01:08:54.564 --> 01:08:57.928]  What have you been seeing, what have you seen over the last 24 hours there?
[01:08:58.609 --> 01:09:09.985]  Well, reaction, and I've got to say, I'm absolutely thrilled that finally Americans are getting off of their collective duffs.
[01:09:11.129 --> 01:09:14.450]  And reacting, for the most part, it was peaceful.
[01:09:14.670 --> 01:09:14.790]  Good.
[01:09:14.810 --> 01:09:22.052]  It might have been obstructionary or obstructional, whatever the particular adjective, but very, very peaceful.
[01:09:23.212 --> 01:09:28.153]  The NYPD has been, I think, equally as accommodating.
[01:09:28.973 --> 01:09:40.476]  So there's a part of me, David, that says, great for the First Amendment, great that finally, instead of sitting home and, you know, tweeting and favoriting or retweeting, somebody's actually speaking up now.
[01:09:42.054 --> 01:09:47.739]  I'm not saying everybody necessarily is correct in what they're protesting.
[01:09:47.759 --> 01:09:50.622]  There's a lot that's going on here, but it doesn't really matter.
[01:09:50.662 --> 01:09:57.308]  The First Amendment rings true and I'm very proud as an American to see that people are utilizing that right and peacefully.
[01:09:57.694 --> 01:10:10.105]  That's good, and so you're not seeing the New York police essentially getting kind of provocative in the way they interact with the crowds like they did in Ferguson, kind of getting in their face, drawing a line, don't get here, stand over there, now you can't stand over there.
[01:10:10.225 --> 01:10:13.088]  We've seen that happen so many times in so many different cities.
[01:10:13.108 --> 01:10:16.310]  We saw it happen in Dallas with the JFK commemoration.
[01:10:16.350 --> 01:10:17.511]  We saw it happen in Ferguson.
[01:10:17.531 --> 01:10:18.612]  That's not happening in New York?
[01:10:19.193 --> 01:10:21.875]  Well, it may be happening, but it's not being reported.
[01:10:22.796 --> 01:10:34.379]  It's a city of 8 million people, a lot of areas, and so they're very well made, but from what I'm hearing and what I'm seeing, they've been most professional, as they normally are.
[01:10:34.399 --> 01:10:36.659]  I mean, let me just stop right there.
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:43.761]  You know, David, we always have to do this proviso.
[01:10:44.864 --> 01:10:46.225]  Not all police are bad.
[01:10:46.546 --> 01:10:46.766]  Right.
[01:10:47.387 --> 01:10:48.348]  They do a good job.
[01:10:48.568 --> 01:10:49.609]  Yes, we know that.
[01:10:49.949 --> 01:10:50.850]  We understand that.
[01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:54.454]  And we don't want to live, I don't want to live in a society without police.
[01:10:54.534 --> 01:10:57.016]  I'm not a full-blown anarchist or whatever.
[01:10:57.497 --> 01:11:01.541]  But you brought up something which is the most important.
[01:11:02.362 --> 01:11:08.207]  You know, David, in my humble opinion, I don't mean to interrupt, but just so that you know my point of view, the issue is not race.
[01:11:09.343 --> 01:11:17.717]  The issue is the hyper-militarization of the police, number one, which we have been talking about and I have been talking about for years, that's number one.
[01:11:17.737 --> 01:11:18.538]  Right.
[01:11:18.959 --> 01:11:20.141]  Number two, there's a systemic
[01:11:21.690 --> 01:11:35.759]  If you will, attitudinal problem in some departments, in some cases, where the police are almost allowed to assume this very hyper-adversarial position.
[01:11:35.819 --> 01:11:37.740]  It's kind of an attitude.
[01:11:39.341 --> 01:11:40.362]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:11:41.598 --> 01:11:43.419]  Let's assume we had this time machine.
[01:11:43.839 --> 01:11:46.161]  We can go back, we can look at a situation that happened.
[01:11:46.181 --> 01:11:49.683]  We take the Eric Garner case, exactly as it happened.
[01:11:50.404 --> 01:11:52.425]  At the same site, same players.
[01:11:52.965 --> 01:12:06.995]  And through the magic of time travel, we could put in place of Eric Garner, instead of a 300-pound, rather large, African-American male, let's say a slight African-American man who's 80 years old.
[01:12:07.734 --> 01:12:13.316]  And then a grandmother who's white, and a child, and a priest, and a man with a suit, a bunch of variables.
[01:12:13.816 --> 01:12:22.259]  Would we have had same degree of escalation in varying parties involved?
[01:12:23.099 --> 01:12:26.501]  Or would the police have said, no, this is a one-size-fits-all reaction.
[01:12:27.301 --> 01:12:29.862]  When you resist, this is how we react.
[01:12:31.122 --> 01:12:36.204]  And I would venture to say, no, you would not see the police act the same way.
[01:12:37.677 --> 01:12:39.978]  So the question is, why?
[01:12:42.279 --> 01:12:47.841]  Why would they not put a chokehold or Toronto restrained or whatever on a grandmother?
[01:12:48.341 --> 01:12:49.201]  She's resisting.
[01:12:50.321 --> 01:12:52.682]  Or a man in a business suit or a priest.
[01:12:53.663 --> 01:12:55.363]  And I think we have to be honest.
[01:12:56.223 --> 01:12:57.544]  Yes, there is a reaction.
[01:12:58.595 --> 01:12:59.496]  Now is that racist?
[01:13:00.236 --> 01:13:00.657]  I don't know.
[01:13:00.677 --> 01:13:02.358]  I think that word's too patellar.
[01:13:02.918 --> 01:13:04.359]  Too Pavlovian.
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:05.240]  Racism.
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:05.700]  Racism.
[01:13:06.021 --> 01:13:11.885]  Just because there's a disparity is because... Well, you know, Lionel, I kind of think I would come up with a different answer.
[01:13:12.265 --> 01:13:15.748]  I kind of think they would, based on all the different shots we've seen.
[01:13:15.788 --> 01:13:18.070]  I know that the statistics show that
[01:13:18.850 --> 01:13:20.772]  The predominance is against black people.
[01:13:20.812 --> 01:13:24.475]  We know that they're arrested at a higher rate for marijuana.
[01:13:24.495 --> 01:13:27.858]  They go to jail based on the crimes that come together.
[01:13:28.319 --> 01:13:33.303]  They are more likely to serve jail time if they're arrested for marijuana than white people are.
[01:13:33.323 --> 01:13:37.727]  So I understand there is a systemic bias against blacks.
[01:13:37.747 --> 01:13:39.349]  There's no doubt about that.
[01:13:39.509 --> 01:13:39.889]  Absolutely.
[01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:42.812]  But you know I've seen so many police brutality
[01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:45.895]  Videos, just that video that just went viral.
[01:13:45.935 --> 01:13:47.796]  We had it up on our site earlier in the week.
[01:13:48.016 --> 01:13:49.378]  This is what happens when you call the police.
[01:13:49.418 --> 01:13:52.861]  I mean, I see people of all different colors see that happening to them.
[01:13:53.121 --> 01:13:58.305]  They've got mandatory drawing blood, even if you're not drinking.
[01:13:58.325 --> 01:14:00.307]  They don't even have to be suspicious that you're a drunk driver.
[01:14:00.327 --> 01:14:02.929]  They can just demand to draw your blood.
[01:14:02.969 --> 01:14:04.971]  I've seen pictures of people saying, what is this?
[01:14:04.991 --> 01:14:05.692]  Is this America?
[01:14:06.212 --> 01:14:06.372]  Right.
[01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:08.913]  And that's a white guy in that particular case.
[01:14:09.273 --> 01:14:10.253]  A point well taken.
[01:14:10.634 --> 01:14:12.494]  You bring up an excellent, excellent point.
[01:14:12.574 --> 01:14:15.135]  And by the way, we need this so much.
[01:14:15.215 --> 01:14:19.537]  Not only in media and radio, but just talking.
[01:14:19.717 --> 01:14:27.960]  Not necessarily saying my hashtag, my selfie, you know, image is better than yours, or more pithier, is pithier than yours.
[01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:32.021]  Let me go back to some other cases, which I think are horrible, and really speak to what you're saying.
[01:14:32.964 --> 01:14:35.365]  It was a case, horrible case, that we solved.
[01:14:35.485 --> 01:14:38.025]  Kelly Thomas, 2011, Fullerton County.
[01:14:39.046 --> 01:14:40.406]  Schizophrenic, homeless man.
[01:14:41.666 --> 01:14:46.407]  Known by Fullerton County, these police officers, who was beaten to death.
[01:14:46.987 --> 01:14:52.989]  Not quickly, but it involved a series of blows and contact.
[01:14:53.269 --> 01:14:56.750]  Put him into a coma, and then life support was pulled.
[01:14:58.621 --> 01:15:03.683]  Would that situation have been different had it been a different man, a different situation?
[01:15:03.903 --> 01:15:05.204]  I say yes.
[01:15:05.644 --> 01:15:06.364]  Not because of race.
[01:15:07.104 --> 01:15:21.650]  I think that sometimes cops, in situations like this, do have the ability to say, you know, this guy's being arrested here, Eric Garner, back to him, for selling loose cigarettes, untaxed.
[01:15:22.211 --> 01:15:24.872]  This is not exactly public enemy number one.
[01:15:25.092 --> 01:15:26.112]  Right, exactly.
[01:15:26.152 --> 01:15:27.813]  This is, this is this,
[01:15:28.724 --> 01:15:31.089]  Nonsense called the Broken Windows Theory.
[01:15:31.109 --> 01:15:32.131]  You're going to hear a lot about that.
[01:15:32.251 --> 01:15:33.373]  The Broken Windows Theory.
[01:15:33.473 --> 01:15:34.294]  Sounds terrific!
[01:15:34.755 --> 01:15:36.258]  Quality of life crimes.
[01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:38.041]  Quality of life!
[01:15:38.829 --> 01:15:43.071]  I don't think that if somebody was saying, whoa, whoa, Knight, hold it, you and I are partners.
[01:15:43.412 --> 01:15:43.972]  Imagine that.
[01:15:44.512 --> 01:15:45.813]  Hold it, hold it.
[01:15:45.913 --> 01:15:46.833]  It's that 90 year old grandmother.
[01:15:46.853 --> 01:15:47.634]  Don't you understand?
[01:15:47.694 --> 01:15:48.254]  We reacted.
[01:15:48.394 --> 01:15:48.594]  No.
[01:15:48.834 --> 01:15:49.375]  People do.
[01:15:49.435 --> 01:15:53.897]  There is, they have the ability to say, whoa, wait a minute, sir, back up.
[01:15:53.957 --> 01:15:55.158]  We don't want to bother you.
[01:15:55.478 --> 01:15:56.458]  Or, or Tamir Rice.
[01:15:56.879 --> 01:15:58.319]  Whatever happened to the bullhorn?
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:15:59.920]  Whatever happened to getting on?
[01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:01.481]  You dropped the gun.
[01:16:01.821 --> 01:16:03.042]  Put your hands up.
[01:16:04.897 --> 01:16:10.062]  The way police confront, going back and I'm jumping around and I'm sorry for that, but you mentioned Tamir Rice.
[01:16:10.102 --> 01:16:10.582]  This is the case.
[01:16:11.563 --> 01:16:15.947]  If you and I were partners, I would say, why are we driving up to this person that we think has a gun?
[01:16:16.027 --> 01:16:16.347]  Why don't we?
[01:16:17.521 --> 01:16:18.682]  Make it a safe distance.
[01:16:19.023 --> 01:16:20.044]  Call for backup.
[01:16:20.384 --> 01:16:21.505]  What's the hurry?
[01:16:21.906 --> 01:16:23.007]  He's by himself.
[01:16:23.508 --> 01:16:24.469]  Let's use this.
[01:16:24.949 --> 01:16:26.991]  I don't understand the immediacy.
[01:16:27.412 --> 01:16:28.273]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:16:28.753 --> 01:16:29.694]  It's frightening.
[01:16:29.874 --> 01:16:30.996]  It's systemic.
[01:16:31.176 --> 01:16:32.617]  It's attitude.
[01:16:32.697 --> 01:16:33.799]  It's us and them.
[01:16:33.899 --> 01:16:34.860]  It's where the cup?
[01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:35.721]  I don't know.
[01:16:36.321 --> 01:16:41.905]  And we can see the video there, you know, he doesn't look to me like he's a serious threat to them, like he's fighting back.
[01:16:42.205 --> 01:16:47.429]  I've got Paul Joseph Watson joined us on the line from the UK, and I wanted to get, let's put that question to Paul.
[01:16:47.489 --> 01:16:48.249]  Paul, what do you think?
[01:16:48.269 --> 01:17:05.681]  Do you think, in terms of the way this is being portrayed by many in New York as racism, you've got a story up on Infowars.com right now, some people tweeting out that they thought that playing White Christmas at the Christmas tree lighting ceremony at Rockefeller Center in New York was racist.
[01:17:07.042 --> 01:17:11.445]  Well, I mean, this is an example of how this has degenerated so quickly.
[01:17:12.126 --> 01:17:22.494]  And you know, David, I was attacked as a white supremacist for supporting the facts in the Brown case, just as I've been attacked as a cop hater for supporting the facts in the Garner case.
[01:17:23.054 --> 01:17:29.879]  But this has been hijacked by social justice warriors, as Lionel said, to all be about race.
[01:17:29.979 --> 01:17:32.241]  When it's not about race, it's about violence.
[01:17:33.562 --> 01:17:42.005]  As he mentioned, Darius Rucker, this black singer, sung White Christmas at the New York tree lighting ceremony last night.
[01:17:42.725 --> 01:17:44.665]  And the outrage was immediate.
[01:17:45.726 --> 01:17:50.567]  That snow itself, a form of frozen precipitation, could be racist.
[01:17:51.107 --> 01:17:55.769]  That this was an offensive slur against the Ghana verdict.
[01:17:56.469 --> 01:17:58.029]  And, you know, I sent out a tweet.
[01:17:59.070 --> 01:18:01.050]  White Christmas is a song about snow.
[01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:02.831]  It's not a song about white people.
[01:18:03.351 --> 01:18:03.511]  Yeah.
[01:18:03.551 --> 01:18:20.504]  So it's an illustration of how this has been hijacked by many on the left, just as the Ferguson protests were hijacked by communists, to make everything about race and not about what it should be, which is police brutality, which is what we should all be unifying against.
[01:18:21.145 --> 01:18:25.749]  Because when they make it about race, that only ostracizes conservatives.
[01:18:26.029 --> 01:18:28.331]  It turns away half of Americans
[01:18:29.252 --> 01:18:37.657]  They don't want to support this movement because it comes across as ludicrous when people are saying that singing White Christmas is a racial slur.
[01:18:37.897 --> 01:18:39.618]  It's actually counterproductive.
[01:18:39.658 --> 01:18:41.599]  This is about violence, it's not about race.
[01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:43.240]  You know, white privilege.
[01:18:43.681 --> 01:18:53.667]  There's a hashtag, Twitter trend, Criming Wild White, which is a bunch of white people confessing their white guilt over having minor infractions and not being punished by police.
[01:18:54.187 --> 01:18:55.008]  But, you know,
[01:18:55.828 --> 01:19:02.714]  Kelly Thomas, his white privilege didn't count for anything when he was beaten to a bloody pulp in California.
[01:19:03.114 --> 01:19:07.137]  James Boyd shot down like a stray dog in Albuquerque.
[01:19:07.457 --> 01:19:11.201]  He couldn't rely on his white privilege to save him from that situation.
[01:19:11.701 --> 01:19:14.543]  So it's not about black or white, it's about police brutality.
[01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:16.205]  That's what we need to focus on.
[01:19:16.445 --> 01:19:21.529]  We've got a break coming up, but we've also got this story from Kit Daniels.
[01:19:22.189 --> 01:19:24.251]  I want to get Lionel's reaction to this.
[01:19:25.572 --> 01:19:34.257]  Tweeting out, and this is a tweet somebody put out, next time someone asks, white privilege is fatally choking a man on camera for millions to witness and getting away with it.
[01:19:34.317 --> 01:19:37.719]  I would say that's not white privilege, I would say that's maybe blue privilege.
[01:19:37.759 --> 01:19:46.624]  We need to look at what is actually going on with these grand jury situations and I want to get Lionel's reaction to that as a former prosecutor, as a defense attorney.
[01:19:47.805 --> 01:19:51.269]  Talk to us about what's going on in these grand juries.
[01:19:51.389 --> 01:19:59.157]  Why aren't we seeing indictments come so that we can have a public open trial that the public can see the evidence that's there.
[01:19:59.197 --> 01:20:00.859]  I think that would de-escalate these situations.
[01:20:00.899 --> 01:20:03.582]  We'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson and Lionel.
[01:20:03.682 --> 01:20:04.083]  Stay with us.

[01:24:11.288 --> 01:24:16.171]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:16.351 --> 01:24:21.955]  I'm David Knight in Austin and we have a Brit joining us.
[01:24:21.995 --> 01:24:24.316]  Paul Joseph Watson from the UK as well as Lionel.
[01:24:24.396 --> 01:24:26.678]  And I wanted to go back to Lionel about this
[01:24:39.145 --> 01:24:41.707]  Grand jury indictment, or I should say non-indictment.
[01:24:42.828 --> 01:24:50.874]  We just had Judge Andrew Napolitano go on a radio show yesterday and say, I think it's clearly a case for criminally negligent homicide.
[01:24:51.314 --> 01:24:55.637]  He said, I think that the use of deadly forces is not Ferguson, Missouri.
[01:24:55.677 --> 01:24:57.299]  This is not somebody wrestling for your gun.
[01:24:57.459 --> 01:24:59.340]  This is not where you shoot at or be shot at.
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:02.843]  He said, this is a choking death of a mentally impaired, grossly obese person.
[01:25:03.303 --> 01:25:07.046]  His only crime was selling cigarettes without collecting taxes on them.
[01:25:07.367 --> 01:25:10.109]  It doesn't call for deadly force by any stretch of the imagination.
[01:25:10.149 --> 01:25:11.150]  But then he says this.
[01:25:12.051 --> 01:25:18.436]  He says, the grand jury decision tells me that the district attorney didn't want an indictment.
[01:25:19.377 --> 01:25:24.041]  Does that tell you the same thing, Lionel, as a former prosecutor and defense attorney?
[01:25:24.601 --> 01:25:26.043]  No, it doesn't.
[01:25:26.923 --> 01:25:30.487]  It could, but it doesn't necessarily tell me that.
[01:25:31.348 --> 01:25:36.149]  Let me break this down very, very carefully.
[01:25:37.050 --> 01:25:43.091]  You know, you had mentioned something before where you said, we're not conspiracy theorists, we're skeptical.
[01:25:43.792 --> 01:25:49.353]  So yes, I can be very skeptical about this grand jury, no bill.
[01:25:49.373 --> 01:25:51.694]  OK, but it works like this.
[01:25:54.065 --> 01:26:01.487]  A prosecutor delivers a case to the grand jury, and the grand jury historically has been almost like an outlier.
[01:26:02.007 --> 01:26:05.449]  This weird tribunal.
[01:26:05.809 --> 01:26:11.731]  It's not a part of the criminal justice system, not a part of the judiciary, not the legislature, not really anything.
[01:26:11.771 --> 01:26:18.153]  It's kind of like this, ideally set up as this neutral, detached buffer between a
[01:26:20.228 --> 01:26:22.850]  The magistrate, the crown, and the people.
[01:26:23.110 --> 01:26:29.414]  The idea of standing there between the marauding crown and people and saying, no, no, you have a case, you don't have a case.
[01:26:29.674 --> 01:26:31.335]  Well, that might be fine historically.
[01:26:32.276 --> 01:26:38.920]  What it means is, is that provided there's enough probable cause, and the best definition of probable cause is, you probably did it.
[01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:42.702]  Probable cause in burdens is here.
[01:26:43.403 --> 01:26:44.944]  Reasonable doubt is here.
[01:26:46.819 --> 01:26:51.821]  And you're saying the probable cause for people that aren't watching and listening on the radio, you're saying probable cause is much, much lower?
[01:26:51.841 --> 01:26:53.382]  Correct.
[01:26:53.743 --> 01:26:55.684]  Probable cause means he probably did it.
[01:26:55.784 --> 01:26:57.545]  It's the easiest burden you can imagine.
[01:26:58.185 --> 01:26:59.246]  But here's the problem.
[01:27:00.506 --> 01:27:06.670]  If I'm a prosecutor, I don't want to bring a case that I think is going to stink at the trial level.
[01:27:07.697 --> 01:27:23.169]  I don't want to bring a case where the medical examiner in this particular case, we believe because we really haven't heard the Staten Island Grand Jury minutes, but let's assume the prosecutor or the medical examiner testified that A, this was not a chokehold.
[01:27:24.050 --> 01:27:26.192]  A chokehold, a carotid restraint.
[01:27:26.792 --> 01:27:33.898]  This was a poorly used neck restraint or something.
[01:27:34.662 --> 01:27:47.453]  He did say that the cause of death was compression, but also chest compression, and also asthma, perhaps obesity, perhaps other factors.
[01:27:47.753 --> 01:28:01.866]  So the question number one is, imagine that this indictment came, this indictment was issued, and at the trial level, the defense lawyer says, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
[01:28:02.728 --> 01:28:09.990]  Can you find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that this death was caused by this officer?
[01:28:11.190 --> 01:28:13.571]  If no, that's not guilty.
[01:28:14.491 --> 01:28:20.032]  So, just because it works at the grand jury level, doesn't mean it's going to work at the trial level.
[01:28:20.173 --> 01:28:28.795]  And any prosecutor who merely says, I don't care whether this case has a chance of conviction, my job is to get a
[01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:30.340]  I don't
[01:28:45.630 --> 01:28:48.032]  Wait a minute, because we're about out of time on this segment.
[01:28:48.072 --> 01:28:51.634]  We'll join this when we come back at the bottom of the hour, but we're talking about the grand jury.
[01:28:52.254 --> 01:29:02.261]  I think it's important for people to understand, and this is the problem that I have with it, is the fact that this isn't a trial situation where, you know, you've only got the prosecutor addressing the jury.
[01:29:02.301 --> 01:29:04.242]  He can tell them anything that he wants to.
[01:29:04.302 --> 01:29:06.463]  It's not an adversarial relationship.
[01:29:06.503 --> 01:29:10.146]  There isn't a defense attorney present, because nobody's been indicted yet.
[01:29:10.746 --> 01:29:17.972]  So he can basically tell them whatever he wants to, and no matter how skewed the evidence is, there's nobody to object to that.
[01:29:18.112 --> 01:29:26.099]  That's why they've had 162,000 grand juries with only 11 cases where it wasn't returned as an indictment.
[01:29:26.139 --> 01:29:33.024]  That's why you have that familiar saying that Judge Napolitano repeated, you can get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich.
[01:29:33.565 --> 01:29:37.348]  I want to pick up with that before we go on to the different rules that we have for police
[01:29:37.728 --> 01:29:40.310]  Right after we come back from the break, we're talking to Lionel.
[01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:46.013]  He's in New York, a former prosecutor as well as a talk show host personality there.
[01:29:46.053 --> 01:29:48.214]  We also have Paul Joseph Watson joining us from the UK.
[01:29:48.234 --> 01:29:54.197]  I'm going to give him a chance to ask Lionel some questions about what's going on with police brutality.
[01:29:54.217 --> 01:29:54.858]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:54.898 --> 01:29:55.318]  Stay with us.
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:00.641]  We're on the march.
[01:30:01.141 --> 01:30:02.742]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.682 --> 01:30:06.384]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.498 --> 01:30:16.759]  When I first got online and I seen the price of X2 and the DNA Force, I was a little hesitant, but I pulled the trigger on it.
[01:30:16.919 --> 01:30:17.880]  It has changed my life.
[01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:21.420]  I've been taking it for about 24 days now, pounding the weights, staying in shape.

[01:30:31.562 --> 01:30:34.223]  Now, I'm able to function as a human again.
[01:30:34.343 --> 01:30:43.786]  Whether it's survival shield nascent iodine or DNA force, super male vitality, super female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shields, oxy powder.

[01:32:17.059 --> 01:32:19.720]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:26.523]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:32:26.803 --> 01:32:29.644]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?

[01:32:34.767 --> 01:32:37.608]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:32:37.688 --> 01:32:43.190]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.

[01:33:14.557 --> 01:33:16.078]  We are on the march.
[01:33:16.418 --> 01:33:18.838]  The empire is on the run.
[01:33:19.598 --> 01:33:23.299]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:27.642 --> 01:33:28.982]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:29.042 --> 01:33:30.343]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[01:33:30.763 --> 01:33:36.444]  Joining me is Lionel from New York, and of course he is a former prosecutor and defense attorney.
[01:33:36.464 --> 01:33:51.587]  I want to get his take on what's going on with the grand jury part of this, because I think a lot of people are looking at this and seeing the government investigating itself in secret, because grand jury proceedings are secret, and of course finding itself not guilty.
[01:33:51.647 --> 01:33:54.828]  We see this happening so many times, and so I think a lot of people
[01:33:55.708 --> 01:33:57.409]  I would like to see this happen in public.
[01:33:57.449 --> 01:33:58.149]  I know I would.
[01:33:58.169 --> 01:34:00.311]  It makes me suspicious to see this happening.
[01:34:00.331 --> 01:34:04.633]  I look at the statistics, the latest year that the Justice Department kept statistics.
[01:34:04.673 --> 01:34:08.375]  It's like 162,000 grand jury cases that they looked at.
[01:34:08.555 --> 01:34:11.177]  Only 11 did not return an indictment.
[01:34:11.277 --> 01:34:22.003]  So we kind of, I look at this and it's like, yes, I know they use grand juries to test to see how strong a case they've got, but isn't it possible that we've also got a grand jury being used as a beard?
[01:34:22.583 --> 01:34:31.605]  For a prosecution that the prosecutor doesn't really want to go through with for maybe reasons other than there's there's not anything to look at here.
[01:34:32.285 --> 01:34:43.107]  Before we do, before I go back to Lionel and to Paul Joseph Watson who's with us from the UK, this is Cyber Week Christmas specials going on this week at InfoWars Store.
[01:34:43.487 --> 01:34:45.328]  We have free shipping storewide.
[01:34:45.908 --> 01:34:49.209]  We also have our Prison Planet membership which is regularly $59.99 only now
[01:34:51.809 --> 01:34:53.210]  $29.95 a year.
[01:34:53.290 --> 01:34:54.551]  That's seven months for free.
[01:34:54.571 --> 01:34:56.492]  That's only two and a half dollars a month.
[01:34:57.012 --> 01:34:59.833]  And you can now share that with 20 other friends.
[01:34:59.873 --> 01:35:02.795]  It used to be just 11 that you could share it with.
[01:35:02.835 --> 01:35:04.956]  Now that's bumped up to 20 other friends.
[01:35:05.016 --> 01:35:07.237]  So that's something that supports our operation.
[01:35:07.437 --> 01:35:12.499]  That's where you'll see the news as it happens every weeknight at 7 central, 8 p.m.
[01:35:12.599 --> 01:35:15.721]  Eastern with me, with Leanne McAdoo, with Jakari Jackson.
[01:35:16.321 --> 01:35:23.752]  Darren McBrain, Rob Due are all there with the nightly news and that's something that really helps to support our operation to pay for the bandwidth there.
[01:35:24.052 --> 01:35:28.018]  That's on sale, 50% off, well actually more than 50% off, it's seven months for free.
[01:35:28.579 --> 01:35:31.422]  We also have silver back in stock, 20% off, free shipping for that.
[01:35:32.239 --> 01:35:33.599]  We only have a limited amount of that.
[01:35:33.639 --> 01:35:36.721]  It's going to sell out pretty soon, and it takes us a while to get that back in stock.
[01:35:36.741 --> 01:35:42.002]  You can also get a Super Prep Pack, Silver Bullet, and Survival Shield for $15 off.
[01:35:42.202 --> 01:35:46.064]  And if you just get the Silver, you can buy four of those and get one free.
[01:35:46.084 --> 01:35:50.225]  So that's over and above the free shipping and the 20% off.
[01:35:50.805 --> 01:35:52.026]  Now back to our guests.
[01:35:52.386 --> 01:35:55.247]  Lionel, you heard what I had to say about grand juries.
[01:35:55.287 --> 01:35:58.268]  I mean, I think that a lot of people really wanted to see
[01:35:59.608 --> 01:36:04.930]  The evidence presented in Ferguson, as well as here, they wanted to see that it was going to be investigated openly.
[01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:06.410]  They wanted to see what evidence there was.
[01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:09.171]  In Ferguson, we got a document dump after the fact.
[01:36:09.211 --> 01:36:13.552]  And usually, we don't even hear anything about what goes on in a grand jury.
[01:36:13.572 --> 01:36:14.852]  It's usually kept secret.
[01:36:14.892 --> 01:36:20.274]  We don't know, in New York, even what the charges were that were being investigated as to whether he's going to be indicted.
[01:36:20.294 --> 01:36:20.614]  Go ahead.
[01:36:21.032 --> 01:36:25.716]  Well, as far as Ferguson goes, I've got to tell you something, that may be one of the most thorough grand juries ever.
[01:36:26.156 --> 01:36:27.197]  That was an anomaly.
[01:36:27.657 --> 01:36:28.698]  It's not supposed to be like that.
[01:36:28.898 --> 01:36:37.384]  You see, what we're doing is we're in essence saying, how dare Bob McCulloch not be so quick and so railroad-ish in his grand jury like others?
[01:36:37.625 --> 01:36:39.366]  How dare he put on so much evidence?
[01:36:39.586 --> 01:36:44.430]  How dare he be so thorough in putting on evidence which people call exculpatory?
[01:36:44.670 --> 01:36:45.992]  How dare he do that?
[01:36:46.312 --> 01:36:53.521]  Come on, you're supposed to run this thing through and indict that ham sandwich, which the great jurist Saul Wachtler coined in 1985.
[01:36:54.402 --> 01:36:56.244]  No, what happens is this.
[01:36:56.505 --> 01:36:58.587]  I wish more cases were thorough.
[01:36:58.748 --> 01:36:59.729]  It's the opposite.
[01:36:59.969 --> 01:37:01.751]  Yeah, he'd never done that in 28 years.
[01:37:01.791 --> 01:37:03.792]  Why do you think that he never did that in 28 years?
[01:37:03.832 --> 01:37:12.479]  Did he give the other people that he went through the grand jury process, did he give them a fair trial if he only gives the cop a full investigation?
[01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:25.050]  And of course, he's presenting evidence that there's, you know, he's... I guess a lot of people, as I look at some of the evidence that's come out of there, and as I look at some of the transcripts, and there was like over a thousand pages, so people are just now starting to get through that.
[01:37:25.350 --> 01:37:27.772]  Looks to me like there was a lot of coaching, a lot of protection.
[01:37:27.832 --> 01:37:28.513]  It looks to me like
[01:37:29.013 --> 01:37:30.234]  Darren Wilson wasn't on trial.
[01:37:30.274 --> 01:37:33.817]  Michael Brown was on trial in that grand jury.
[01:37:34.598 --> 01:37:36.439]  Let me just clarify something.
[01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:38.861]  I'm not defending this.
[01:37:39.021 --> 01:37:52.713]  I'm trying to explain a system that I have spent most of my adult life trying to figure out, and certainly not directed to you, but there are a lot of armchair instant experts who say, boy, this grand jury thing screwed up.
[01:37:52.733 --> 01:37:54.094]  I'm thinking, where the hell have you been?
[01:37:54.674 --> 01:37:55.734]  Where have you been?
[01:37:55.795 --> 01:38:00.136]  This whole thing is, people have screamed about this for the longest time.
[01:38:00.396 --> 01:38:01.517]  But let me ask you this question.
[01:38:01.817 --> 01:38:04.938]  Let's assume you're a grand juror, because I want to hear from them ultimately.
[01:38:04.998 --> 01:38:06.359]  I want to hear, forget McCulloch.
[01:38:06.379 --> 01:38:08.480]  I want to hear from somebody from St.
[01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:10.400]  Louis or from Staten Island.
[01:38:10.881 --> 01:38:15.162]  And if you're a grand jury, a juror, and I say, ladies and gentlemen, we have something you don't normally hear.
[01:38:15.422 --> 01:38:17.623]  Here's the target of the investigation, the cop.
[01:38:18.144 --> 01:38:23.726]  And he takes a stand and he says, I was, this is the Michael Brown case, I was placed in fear.
[01:38:24.486 --> 01:38:28.069]  I was placed in fear and I reacted because I thought I was saving my life.
[01:38:28.270 --> 01:38:28.870]  Okay, good.
[01:38:29.291 --> 01:38:30.211]  He testifies.
[01:38:30.832 --> 01:38:33.835]  Now remember, his lawyer can't cross-examine.
[01:38:33.855 --> 01:38:35.796]  He's just there.
[01:38:36.758 --> 01:38:38.359]  Well, grand jurors can ask questions.
[01:38:38.719 --> 01:38:40.300]  And that brings up an important point, Lionel.
[01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:49.546]  If you were his defense attorney, would you allow your client to go testify before a grand jury where you could not be present for everything he says is going to be on the record?
[01:38:49.766 --> 01:38:54.769]  Would you let him talk for four hours if you didn't believe that the prosecutor was on his side?
[01:38:56.350 --> 01:38:56.890]  I wouldn't.
[01:38:57.351 --> 01:39:01.053]  I wouldn't let anybody testify, ever.
[01:39:01.333 --> 01:39:02.734]  Yeah, they typically don't do that, yeah.
[01:39:03.627 --> 01:39:06.708]  But what happens is, you see, look, and I know how this looks.
[01:39:07.168 --> 01:39:15.932]  It's like, hey, listen, why don't you come and testify and well, I'll ask you some simple questions and we'll basically load it up.
[01:39:17.532 --> 01:39:28.821]  Until a grand jury says, wait a minute, I was there and we declined to prosecute, not because we were set up, but we didn't think there was probable cause.
[01:39:28.881 --> 01:39:36.388]  Now, again, the probable cause standard is so slight that whenever probable cause is not had, you wonder,
[01:39:37.341 --> 01:39:38.381]  What was so special?
[01:39:38.722 --> 01:39:42.303]  But let me go back to now, jumping back to the Eric Garner case.
[01:39:42.783 --> 01:40:00.150]  What in this particular case, if the medical examiner said, I cannot tell you right now whether this death was caused because of a chokehold, because of a pre-existing medical condition, or it was the time to go.
[01:40:00.350 --> 01:40:01.291]  Let me back up.
[01:40:02.151 --> 01:40:05.379]  Medical examiners determined four types of death.
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:07.124]  There are four types of death, period.
[01:40:07.445 --> 01:40:08.808]  Think of the mnemonic NASH.
[01:40:09.008 --> 01:40:09.610]  N-A-S-H.
[01:40:09.971 --> 01:40:10.472]  Natural,
[01:40:11.619 --> 01:40:14.302]  Accidental suicide or homicide.
[01:40:14.802 --> 01:40:15.343]  That's it.
[01:40:16.164 --> 01:40:26.233]  So when a medical examiner says this cause of death was homicide, that means it was a death caused by or because of the action of another.
[01:40:26.474 --> 01:40:35.803]  In fact, people who are executed, people who receive the death penalty on their death certificate, it says cause of death homicide because you're killed.
[01:40:36.323 --> 01:40:39.825]  Right, and that's what the medical examiner said in the case of Eric Gardner, that it was homicide.
[01:40:39.865 --> 01:40:40.305]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:40:40.325 --> 01:40:47.508]  It wasn't natural death, it wasn't an accident, and it wasn't suicide.
[01:40:48.328 --> 01:40:51.310]  So, therefore, there was a human connection.
[01:40:51.930 --> 01:41:04.536]  But this particular case, the police officer, who was under department regulation, unable to do a carotid restraint or chokehold, which in fact may or may not be, that's not against the law!
[01:41:05.376 --> 01:41:10.720]  So what happens is, I'm telling you right now, there is no evidence of murder.
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:12.801]  There is no crime here.
[01:41:12.821 --> 01:41:14.902]  There may be negligence.
[01:41:14.942 --> 01:41:17.884]  Now remember, there's different fora, different forums.
[01:41:18.405 --> 01:41:19.886]  There's the criminal arena.
[01:41:20.566 --> 01:41:22.508]  The civil arena, that's the lawsuit.
[01:41:22.608 --> 01:41:30.635]  That's where you seek monetary damages, big bucks for wrongful death and loss of society, the loss of a father, the loss of a husband.
[01:41:30.936 --> 01:41:35.580]  And then there's federal, either federal civil rights or some other federal crime.
[01:41:36.441 --> 01:41:43.767]  Just because there is no evidence to prove a crime in that there was no evidence of murder,
[01:41:44.924 --> 01:41:51.367]  Involuntary manslaughter does not mean that he's at all off the hook when it comes to civil.
[01:41:51.967 --> 01:41:55.409]  I'm telling you right now, this is a civil slam dunk.
[01:41:55.929 --> 01:42:03.772]  Let me also throw in, there's administrative because he most probably will be bounced off of the NYPD because he violated this rule.
[01:42:04.413 --> 01:42:10.275]  So you would say, so Judge Napolitano said he thought it was clearly a case of criminally negligent homicide.
[01:42:10.295 --> 01:42:14.337]  You would say that, in your opinion, you think it's civilly negligent homicide?
[01:42:14.677 --> 01:42:26.870]  Oh yes, because right now I could say this is not, you see, this is a police officer who did not pick somebody out of a crowd, who decided on his own to be excessive.
[01:42:27.250 --> 01:42:36.820]  This is a police officer, right or wrong, who was in essence ordered to try to restrain someone and he would testify at trial.
[01:42:37.381 --> 01:42:41.463]  He did it because he was following the department's directions.
[01:42:41.863 --> 01:42:48.826]  He swore an oath to follow not only the law, but the orders of his superiors.
[01:42:49.146 --> 01:42:51.467]  And he was told, we have an arrest.
[01:42:51.907 --> 01:42:56.049]  Let's do it like we've done it a thousand times in training.
[01:42:56.289 --> 01:43:00.311]  So this police officer would testify, I'm not acting rogue.
[01:43:00.851 --> 01:43:02.395]  I'm not going off the reservation.
[01:43:02.816 --> 01:43:06.143]  The only thing I did that was negligent was later on.
[01:43:06.184 --> 01:43:07.607]  Now this is where it gets interesting.
[01:43:08.616 --> 01:43:19.505]  If a jury believed, you know, we were with you, officer, until we believed that you heard him say, I can't breathe.
[01:43:19.545 --> 01:43:19.745]  Yeah.
[01:43:20.345 --> 01:43:23.127]  At that point, you should have let go.
[01:43:23.147 --> 01:43:29.973]  At that point, you should have, using all standards of care, realized that you were going too far.
[01:43:30.854 --> 01:43:33.876]  Maybe then there's a negligence portion of it.
[01:43:34.156 --> 01:43:40.942]  Or maybe the point at which he loses consciousness, they try to do something to administer some CPR or something like that.
[01:43:41.462 --> 01:43:45.726]  I want to give Paul Joseph Watson a chance to get in because I've been dominating the conversation with you.
[01:43:45.946 --> 01:43:46.487]  It's fascinating.
[01:43:46.787 --> 01:43:51.131]  Paul, was there anything, how do you feel about this and did you have any question for Lionel?
[01:43:52.389 --> 01:44:00.898]  Yeah, I wanted to get back to this issue about police brutality, the causes of police brutality, because I think this is what we're being misdirected from.
[01:44:01.619 --> 01:44:10.949]  These officers are acting in accordance with their training and that's the main problem because their militarized training, which is being directed to them by the federal government,
[01:44:11.807 --> 01:44:13.168]  Is not to de-escalate.
[01:44:13.548 --> 01:44:25.336]  It's to immediately resort to violence and then when they're exonerated in these cases, it only gives them more confidence to act in the same manner in future situations like we saw with the Eric Garner case.
[01:44:26.056 --> 01:44:28.798]  And my article on Infowars posted a few hours ago.
[01:44:29.258 --> 01:44:43.492]  We have police, in actual police forums, verified members of the law enforcement departments across the country saying that this decision in the Garner case justifies them being able to, quote, kick some thug ass.
[01:44:44.153 --> 01:44:44.293]  So...
[01:44:45.194 --> 01:44:53.638]  They're taking this as a sign that everything they do is justified, again legitimizing police brutality within police departments.
[01:44:53.678 --> 01:45:03.242]  So we have a problem centered around violence and the justification of violence both in the police department and also in the black community.
[01:45:03.262 --> 01:45:09.904]  And this is what is not being discussed because it's being hijacked and it's all being directed towards a debate about race.
[01:45:10.485 --> 01:45:13.126]  You've got FBI crime statistics which show that
[01:45:13.926 --> 01:45:24.940]  Black people commit almost the same number of homicides as whites and Hispanics put together, despite the fact that they only represent 13% of the population in America.
[01:45:25.461 --> 01:45:28.544]  Also, 93% of blacks are killed by other blacks.
[01:45:29.085 --> 01:45:32.309]  Again, despite the fact that they're only 13% of the population.
[01:45:32.749 --> 01:45:35.312]  So, is this because of their skin colour?
[01:45:35.372 --> 01:45:35.572]  No.
[01:45:35.972 --> 01:45:40.818]  Just as because in the case of police, they resort to violence not because of their skin colour.
[01:45:41.198 --> 01:45:46.884]  This is about an endemic problem of violence within both police departments and the black community.
[01:45:48.098 --> 01:45:59.981]  The way that this is being hijacked, and it's all about race, it's all about white privilege, which again in the case of Kelly Thomas and James Boyd, they couldn't exercise their white privilege to save them from their fate.
[01:46:00.701 --> 01:46:01.581]  This is the point.
[01:46:01.641 --> 01:46:03.301]  It's all being misdirected.
[01:46:03.701 --> 01:46:16.224]  What we should be focusing on is the training that law enforcement is getting, which makes them resort to violence immediately, as well as the culture within the black community that promotes this criminality.
[01:46:16.684 --> 01:46:25.287]  Which is hyped and promoted by white-owned entertainment companies which glamorize this thug-life culture through rap and hip-hop.
[01:46:25.748 --> 01:46:33.410]  None of this is being addressed now that the social justice warriors have hijacked this case and basically turned it into Occupy 2.0.
[01:46:33.470 --> 01:46:36.712]  This is being used as a divisive tool.
[01:46:37.668 --> 01:46:48.173]  To turn us away from the problem of violence in both the police community and the black community towards just squabbling with each other over side issues about white privilege.
[01:46:48.193 --> 01:46:49.913]  So I wanted to get Lionel's take on that.
[01:46:50.954 --> 01:46:55.036]  I would not have said it better, my dear friend, that I will not try to.
[01:46:55.696 --> 01:46:58.697]  Let me tell you that imagine this hypothetical.
[01:46:58.917 --> 01:47:01.038]  We have a series of doors.
[01:47:01.959 --> 01:47:06.701]  In this door, we can discuss the grand jury problems, anomalies and the like.
[01:47:07.583 --> 01:47:12.746]  In this door, we can talk about inherent problems within African-American culture.
[01:47:13.206 --> 01:47:15.847]  In this door, we can talk about the hyper-militarization of the police.
[01:47:16.167 --> 01:47:17.848]  In this door, we can talk about training.
[01:47:18.108 --> 01:47:18.589]  In this door.
[01:47:18.829 --> 01:47:19.369]  And you're right.
[01:47:19.409 --> 01:47:28.054]  Now, the problem is that when we change doors in mid-sentence and go from police argument to race,
[01:47:28.994 --> 01:47:44.966]  In a society that is not able to handle critical thinking, in a society with this mamby-pamby, almost cartoonish media, who cannot handle this, throw into the mix, this is a rather complex situation.
[01:47:45.306 --> 01:47:46.967]  Now, what you said, Paul, I agree with 100%.
[01:47:47.467 --> 01:47:52.051]  There has been, and you know, in this country, let's back up.
[01:47:52.847 --> 01:48:07.063]  There has been a firewall, by design, from Posse Comitata in 1878 to our loathing of standing armies, a firewall between civilian law enforcement and military.
[01:48:07.444 --> 01:48:12.490]  I've often said, if you do not like being a police officer,
[01:48:13.030 --> 01:48:20.016]  If you don't like, as we say in New York on all the police cars, you see CPR, Courtesy, Professionalism and Respect.
[01:48:20.637 --> 01:48:28.284]  If you don't want to read rights, if you don't want to take down names and be courteous and be a peace officer or constable, then join the military!
[01:48:28.764 --> 01:48:37.813]  Go someplace where you can engage the military, start shooting when you're told to, because police officers involve a certain skill set that military doesn't.
[01:48:38.453 --> 01:49:06.835]  And what happens is when you throw into the mix this idea through 1033 programs, MRAPs, automatic weapons, from when Sheriff Andy turned into Robocop, and you have this crew-cutted, mirrored glasses, heavily armored look, when you have the Boise Police Department having urban assault commando trucks, when you have this other attitude, and this is what I've heard,
[01:49:07.711 --> 01:49:13.354]  Well, how dare this man, Eric Garner, dare resist arrest?
[01:49:13.954 --> 01:49:22.379]  Now, resist arrest can be, and Paul and David, we've seen this, when somebody asks a police officer, why am I being arrested?
[01:49:22.739 --> 01:49:23.480]  You're resisting!
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:24.060]  Yeah.
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:25.401]  Or takes a picture.
[01:49:26.462 --> 01:49:27.263]  He's arrested.
[01:49:27.743 --> 01:49:34.467]  This is a country, we've seen it from TSA, from gate rapes, from airports.
[01:49:34.808 --> 01:49:42.693]  We have seen the slow, systematic, systemic, heightened militarization on all levels.
[01:49:43.133 --> 01:49:51.839]  It's gotten so bad that even in schools, little kids who point fingers are in essence arrested in the school system.
[01:49:52.100 --> 01:49:55.162]  So we have become this hyper
[01:49:55.902 --> 01:49:59.123]  Law and order on steroids mentality.
[01:49:59.503 --> 01:50:02.684]  That, I agree Paul, is another avenue.
[01:50:03.084 --> 01:50:17.107]  Because I'm sure that if we look to other cultures, other police departments, other countries, they have their store of thugs and the like.
[01:50:17.807 --> 01:50:20.668]  And we have, by virtue of this, let me throw in another problem.
[01:50:22.017 --> 01:50:36.082]  When the social media, God bless protests, but when the momentum of the meme starts, when somebody says, and I know this, you know how many times I see people running around here who are thrilled to be a part of the protest?
[01:50:36.362 --> 01:50:37.882]  Hey, we're going to Grand Central.
[01:50:38.062 --> 01:50:39.963]  Come on, get your phone out.
[01:50:40.043 --> 01:50:41.543]  Let's Instagram this.
[01:50:41.903 --> 01:50:46.585]  This is, I'm not saying people are not sincere, but there is
[01:50:48.140 --> 01:50:50.282]  A celebration sometimes!
[01:50:50.463 --> 01:50:51.984]  Hang on Lionel, we gotta take a break.
[01:50:52.004 --> 01:50:52.765]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:52.865 --> 01:51:05.138]  And as you're talking about the militarization of the police and we're talking about the training, maybe there's a question if would the system have liability if they found these police officers guilty because they trained them to act that way.
[01:51:05.178 --> 01:51:08.301]  We'll be right back with Lionel and Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[01:51:08.321 --> 01:51:08.742]  Stay with us.

[01:54:23.922 --> 01:54:27.925]  I have Lionel on the phone with us, and Paul Joseph Watson is joining us from the UK.
[01:54:28.525 --> 01:54:33.968]  As we were going to break, we were talking about, as Lionel had put it, there's so many different doors to this.
[01:54:34.028 --> 01:54:39.751]  We have the excessive use of force, the militarization of the police, the way they're trained, the way they're equipped.
[01:54:40.191 --> 01:54:42.512]  And then, of course, we also can look at the grand jury.
[01:54:42.872 --> 01:54:46.093]  Why there are so few indictments of the police when they do this.
[01:54:46.133 --> 01:54:47.413]  And I have a question for Lionel.
[01:54:47.453 --> 01:54:59.156]  Is it maybe because if some of these police officers were indicted for doing what they're trained to do, doing what they're equipped to do, which we as a society need to have this discussion as to whether or not we want militarized police.
[01:54:59.216 --> 01:54:59.716]  I sure don't.
[01:55:00.356 --> 01:55:04.677]  And maybe if they're indicted for some of this stuff, would they sue their employers, the system?
[01:55:04.737 --> 01:55:08.619]  Is that why the system apparently is going so easy on them?
[01:55:08.659 --> 01:55:12.300]  Because it would essentially be liable if this started to come out.
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:14.301]  Well, we've got a problem with immunity.
[01:55:14.401 --> 01:55:18.162]  That's because people, we don't want to hamstring police.
[01:55:18.562 --> 01:55:26.925]  We don't want to have them say, because God forbid, David, somebody is attacking you or your family, you don't want police officers saying, you know,
[01:55:28.152 --> 01:55:34.775]  I normally be a little bit more aggressive in helping out David here, but I don't think I want to risk the chance of civil liabilities.
[01:55:35.015 --> 01:55:37.196]  I think I'm going to back off a little bit.
[01:55:37.236 --> 01:55:38.637]  So we obviously don't want that.
[01:55:38.917 --> 01:55:41.438]  But David, may I ask you something, sir?
[01:55:42.679 --> 01:55:51.323]  Do you remember a time, perhaps maybe we're in the same generation, but I know instances where friends of mine
[01:55:52.093 --> 01:56:00.397]  Can tell me a time when, when they were out acting like a fool, police officer came home and brought them home, knocked on the doors and, Mrs. Nye?
[01:56:00.437 --> 01:56:00.677]  Yeah.
[01:56:01.097 --> 01:56:02.418]  Well, David here has been acting up.
[01:56:02.538 --> 01:56:03.198]  Why you?
[01:56:03.218 --> 01:56:03.578]  Oh yeah.
[01:56:04.238 --> 01:56:06.679]  And, and, and they can tell these stories.
[01:56:06.899 --> 01:56:08.360]  You know, Norman Rockwell.
[01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:09.260]  Yes.
[01:56:09.461 --> 01:56:11.241]  The, the picture of the little boy runs away.
[01:56:11.281 --> 01:56:12.062]  Grant, it's a kid.
[01:56:12.972 --> 01:56:37.550]  There are views of, from Sheriff Andy to Adam 12 to Dragnet, Bumper Morgan, the Blue Knight, and all of a sudden, the idea of the police officer as being wise, the guy in the community, the one who ran the traffic signal on Sundays when church let out, that image,
[01:56:38.391 --> 01:56:39.472]  Has been changed.
[01:56:40.012 --> 01:56:41.633]  I want people to Google this.
[01:56:41.733 --> 01:56:43.234]  I told somebody this and they didn't believe it.
[01:56:43.654 --> 01:56:51.939]  Look at the number of cases where people have been denied applications to police forces because their IQs were too high.
[01:56:52.119 --> 01:56:53.720]  Yeah, there was actually a lawsuit about that.
[01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:54.500]  Yes.
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:55.981]  And then the guy lost.
[01:56:56.361 --> 01:56:59.303]  They wouldn't hire him as a cop because they said his IQ was too high.
[01:56:59.343 --> 01:57:01.864]  He sued them and they said, no, they don't have to hire you.
[01:57:01.904 --> 01:57:02.985]  Your IQ is too high.
[01:57:03.712 --> 01:57:08.254]  If we are going, and I'm telling you right now, look no further.
[01:57:08.314 --> 01:57:14.576]  Go back to the TSA, look to the Feds, and look to how people handled that.
[01:57:15.136 --> 01:57:24.920]  Look to how we, not only do we have this new brand of G-Men, but how we became kind of systematically acclimated.
[01:57:25.140 --> 01:57:27.301]  Dare I say, another door.
[01:57:27.801 --> 01:57:30.002]  So we might want to consider this.
[01:57:30.462 --> 01:57:32.603]  Why don't we just abolish the grand jury?
[01:57:33.163 --> 01:57:36.364]  Why don't we just, seriously, we can do it, there's no reason why we can't.
[01:57:36.584 --> 01:57:49.770]  Pass a constitutional amendment or a state statute, just say we're done with this, and have the prosecutor, like in other jurisdictions, like in the state of Florida, the only time you use a grand jury is if it's for a first degree murder or some type of investigation.
[01:57:49.790 --> 01:57:50.230]  That's right.
[01:57:50.710 --> 01:57:54.312]  But just sign the affidavit, sign the indictment, sign it yourself.
[01:57:54.593 --> 01:57:55.533]  What are we doing this for?
[01:57:55.973 --> 01:57:57.014]  Have accountability.
[01:57:57.074 --> 01:58:01.096]  Have the police officer or have special prosecutors.
[01:58:01.297 --> 01:58:01.997]  That's another thing.
[01:58:02.217 --> 01:58:09.842]  Have statewide prosecutors or a law that says when you have a police officer in, let's say, the city of Austin,
[01:58:10.382 --> 01:58:10.622]  I agree.
[01:58:10.642 --> 01:58:10.802]  I agree.
[01:58:26.368 --> 01:58:30.149]  Yeah, and we've had, you know, Serpico, who went through this whole ringer.
[01:58:30.209 --> 01:58:39.070]  He has said that we have to have outside oversight in this, and what outside means, what that means for another jurisdiction, whatever that means, that has to be there.
[01:58:39.110 --> 01:58:46.652]  Thank you so much for joining us, Lionel, out of New York, and we have, and your website is, give them your website, Lionel, we've got a couple of seconds.

[02:00:22.861 --> 02:00:23.762]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:24.402 --> 02:00:28.026]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:28.587 --> 02:00:32.651]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:37.523 --> 02:00:38.684]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:38.704 --> 02:00:42.867]  I'm David Knight in Austin and we have Paul Joseph Watson joining us from the UK.
[02:00:43.348 --> 02:00:54.276]  In the last hour we were talking to Lionel, a talk show host out of New York, about the recent grand jury non-indictments in Ferguson and now in New York with the Eric Garner case.
[02:00:55.377 --> 02:00:58.239]  And he said something in the last segment that I thought was interesting.
[02:00:58.279 --> 02:01:00.380]  I wanted to talk to Paul about this.
[02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:08.784]  And he said, remember back when we were younger, he and I, we had a very different kind of attitude from the police, of course.
[02:01:08.864 --> 02:01:10.285]  And that's what we're all talking about.
[02:01:10.705 --> 02:01:20.210]  This radical change that's being pushed from Washington, this militarization of the police and their equipment and their training and the way they regard themselves in the public.
[02:01:20.270 --> 02:01:21.490]  And Paul, I wanted to ask you this.
[02:01:21.530 --> 02:01:22.091]  I remember this
[02:01:23.092 --> 02:01:28.418]  As we're dating ourselves here, I remember this Roger Miller song, England swings like a pendulum do.
[02:01:28.438 --> 02:01:30.781]  They talked about bobbies on bicycles, two by two.
[02:01:30.801 --> 02:01:37.870]  I was there in the 80s quite a bit of time with my wife and I was really taken back by how
[02:01:39.537 --> 02:01:39.978]  Kind of
[02:01:57.116 --> 02:02:03.878]  And I think it was easier for me to see it there, because it wasn't this very gradual process that has happened in the United States.
[02:02:03.938 --> 02:02:13.361]  Although, in the last few years, they have accelerated the change so much, I think you have to be pretty blind and deaf to not notice what's going on in American Hour.
[02:02:13.381 --> 02:02:14.621]  Just totally apathetic.
[02:02:14.901 --> 02:02:18.562]  But let me get your take on what's going on in the UK, because that was my take on it.
[02:02:18.662 --> 02:02:20.243]  It's a very different situation where they were
[02:02:20.743 --> 02:02:29.393]  Going on patrol, two guys on foot or on bicycle, they had a radio, they had their billy clubs, they could call for support, but they were not armed and it seemed to me they had a very different attitude.
[02:02:31.058 --> 02:02:44.165]  Well, I think there's a statistic, David, which is, I'm not sure if this is correct, but this is what I read today, that police in America have killed more people than police in the UK have ever killed in the history of policing.
[02:02:44.786 --> 02:02:50.829]  Now, it's, that may not be completely accurate, but... You mean, just like the last, in just the last year, over what period of time in America?
[02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:53.661]  Over the last year in America.
[02:02:53.761 --> 02:02:54.582]  Oh, the last year.
[02:02:54.642 --> 02:02:55.963]  That's the last year.
[02:02:55.983 --> 02:03:05.551]  We know they've killed 5,000 Americans since 9-11, and that's primarily as a result of this swatification of the American police force.
[02:03:05.771 --> 02:03:05.991]  Yes.
[02:03:06.051 --> 02:03:16.000]  And that is one of the iconic images of America, unfortunately, to the rest of the world, is police pulling somebody over on the highway and harassing them.
[02:03:16.380 --> 02:03:17.321]  Hey, we're number one!
[02:03:18.422 --> 02:03:18.883]  Exactly.
[02:03:18.903 --> 02:03:22.247]  The show Cops was pretty emblematic of that image.
[02:03:22.868 --> 02:03:24.350]  And generally it's true.
[02:03:24.451 --> 02:03:32.001]  I mean, police in Europe are not nearly as quick to resort to violence and brutality as police in America are.
[02:03:32.422 --> 02:03:34.225]  And again, it goes back to their training.
[02:03:34.785 --> 02:03:42.927]  It goes back to the DHS classifying the American people as the enemy, you know, returning veterans as terrorist threats.
[02:03:43.347 --> 02:03:47.068]  They're constantly harping on about lone wolf extremists.
[02:03:47.548 --> 02:03:54.330]  So police are going out there with this belief that everybody wants to attack them, that their lives are constantly under threat.
[02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:58.051]  And you know, they are in some cases, but it's completely overhyped.
[02:03:58.431 --> 02:04:02.612]  And that's why you see such an instant resort to violence in all these situations.
[02:04:02.932 --> 02:04:09.880]  There's a very explicit aspect of their training, as you point out, to tell them that you're in a very dangerous situation.
[02:04:09.900 --> 02:04:11.341]  There are people out there who want to kill you.
[02:04:11.682 --> 02:04:18.830]  There's actually a killology course that's being taught to police departments around the country saying that it's a war zone out there.
[02:04:18.850 --> 02:04:20.371]  I mean, explicitly saying that.
[02:04:20.411 --> 02:04:21.973]  I mean, that certainly has been the implication.
[02:04:22.434 --> 02:04:23.975]  But I think even to look at
[02:04:24.696 --> 02:04:35.607]  The difference that I saw in the police there as they went from essentially being on foot, on bicycles, and then arming them, putting them in cars, it really changes their attitude.
[02:04:36.027 --> 02:04:40.812]  And if that changes their attitude, just that little bit, giving them a gun changes their attitude,
[02:04:41.372 --> 02:04:50.139]  Think what it's going to do to give them military-style assault weapons, to give them MRAPs, to build it up into a militarized situation like that.
[02:04:50.199 --> 02:05:02.890]  We just had some cops in Alaska, one of the last places in America where they're not armed, and the cops said, my best tool is my mouth, because that's how he can keep things from getting escalated into a violent situation.
[02:05:02.970 --> 02:05:07.133]  That's how he keeps from getting shot, because he's clever, he uses his mouth.
[02:05:07.473 --> 02:05:08.954]  That's the Andy Griffith model.
[02:05:08.974 --> 02:05:10.556]  We're going to be right back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:05:11.016 --> 02:05:20.002]  Unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super-oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here!
[02:05:20.142 --> 02:05:29.889]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy-Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[02:05:30.069 --> 02:05:32.991]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[02:05:33.191 --> 02:05:36.032]  And contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients.
[02:05:36.232 --> 02:05:40.294]  Often times full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[02:05:40.434 --> 02:05:44.815]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[02:05:45.095 --> 02:05:47.376]  Oxy powder does not require time off work.
[02:05:47.536 --> 02:05:49.757]  And there's no need for bad tasting concoctions.
[02:05:50.077 --> 02:05:55.540]  Instead, Oxy-Powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[02:05:55.760 --> 02:06:00.982]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.
[02:06:01.102 --> 02:06:07.065]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com to get started with Oxy-Powder or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:06:10.990 --> 02:06:16.394]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:06:17.654 --> 02:06:22.418]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:06:22.798 --> 02:06:37.868]  There's a place down in Tennessee Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[02:06:49.674 --> 02:06:51.555]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:06:51.815 --> 02:06:53.316]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:06:53.596 --> 02:06:56.178]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:06:56.478 --> 02:07:00.521]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[02:07:00.541 --> 02:07:02.742]  So you can ride all day with confidence.

[02:07:05.804 --> 02:07:07.245]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[02:07:08.186 --> 02:07:08.946]  Others don't.

[02:08:32.197 --> 02:08:34.039]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:40.117 --> 02:08:41.278]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:41.338 --> 02:08:41.979]  I'm David Knight.
[02:08:42.039 --> 02:08:50.066]  On this Thursday, December 4th, 2014, I'm here in the studio in Austin and we have Paul Joseph Watson joining us from the UK.
[02:08:50.726 --> 02:08:59.414]  We're going to talk about some of the, we've been talking mainly about the grand jury non-indictment and the Eric Garner case, the man who
[02:09:00.234 --> 02:09:00.775]  We're good to go.
[02:09:22.694 --> 02:09:27.278]  Saying that forcing quotas requires them to make arrests without probable cause.
[02:09:27.798 --> 02:09:30.360]  This is coming in Illinois, of all places.
[02:09:30.400 --> 02:09:32.682]  This is a town called Normal.
[02:09:33.263 --> 02:09:39.488]  And I would say that the Normal situation is that that's what cops appear to be doing in many, many cities.
[02:09:40.088 --> 02:09:43.351]  That's exactly what was happening in the New York Police Department.
[02:09:43.651 --> 02:09:48.875]  That's what Adrian Schoolcraft wore a wire on himself to record that happening over and over again.
[02:09:49.716 --> 02:09:55.900]  That he was told to go arrest people just to have a headcount on non-violent crime.
[02:09:56.340 --> 02:09:58.842]  Allowing serious crime to go unpunished.
[02:09:58.882 --> 02:10:05.566]  Discouraging people from filing complaints on serious crimes and yet hammering people on petty regulations.
[02:10:06.007 --> 02:10:12.131]  Now in this particular story, they say that this is several police officers now have taken a lawsuit.
[02:10:12.771 --> 02:10:17.015]  They've taken a different approach than Serpico did, a different approach than Adrian Schoolcraft did.
[02:10:17.055 --> 02:10:25.362]  These guys got together, and to their credit, and we need to, as Serpico said, we need to stand up for the cops who do the right thing.
[02:10:25.522 --> 02:10:26.663]  These cops are doing the right thing.
[02:10:26.703 --> 02:10:29.905]  Patrol officers Brian Larimore, Debrake Weir,
[02:10:31.059 --> 02:10:40.046]  Deborah Weir, Todd Van Hoven were tired of being forced to collect a minimum amount of revenue each month or face disciplinary consequences.
[02:10:40.086 --> 02:10:47.953]  They claim the department is abusing its power and they have filed a multi-page lawsuit, I think it's 27 pages, dealing with these allegations.
[02:10:48.573 --> 02:10:51.297]  They say that it's more than just traffic citations as well.
[02:10:51.318 --> 02:10:56.105]  The lawsuit details requirements to make at least two criminal arrests each month.
[02:10:56.165 --> 02:10:58.208]  So they're not just after petty regulations.
[02:10:58.229 --> 02:11:01.674]  They're actually going out and have a quota of criminal arrests.
[02:11:02.691 --> 02:11:02.791]  Okay.
[02:11:33.491 --> 02:11:34.432]  So, there you go.
[02:11:34.752 --> 02:11:36.593]  That was what was happening in New York.
[02:11:36.633 --> 02:11:38.734]  That's what Adrian Schoolcraft blew the whistle on.
[02:11:39.155 --> 02:11:58.645]  For that, they put him in an insane asylum until his dad found him and got him out and also found the recording where they, I think it was the number two, if I'm correct or not, the number two at the New York Police Department was threatening him and was there at his apartment when they put him into the insane asylum.
[02:12:00.026 --> 02:12:01.308]  I want to get Paul's reaction to this.
[02:12:01.328 --> 02:12:03.251]  We have Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[02:12:03.952 --> 02:12:09.199]  It seems to me, Paul, this is very much like the war on drugs, this petty issue here.
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:14.106]  If we can kill a man for a cigarette tax, isn't that what we've been doing with the war on drugs?
[02:12:14.126 --> 02:12:16.850]  You know, when we have these SWAT teams who basically throw
[02:12:17.590 --> 02:12:31.068]  Flash grenades into a baby's crib and it's all justified and the militarized SWAT teams are all justified because it's about this prohibition law that we passed and of course now that we got the law we are entitled to do anything to any extreme to enforce that law.
[02:12:32.580 --> 02:12:33.260]  Well, exactly.
[02:12:33.801 --> 02:12:36.382]  This is what people have missed again in the Garner case.
[02:12:36.842 --> 02:12:46.108]  The confrontation, the death of Eric Garner would have never have occurred if not for this ludicrous New York State and city cigarette tax.
[02:12:46.488 --> 02:12:47.308]  There was a 190% hike in cigarette tax.
[02:12:50.510 --> 02:12:52.652]  In New York State since 2006.
[02:12:53.472 --> 02:12:59.977]  In turn, that led to a 59% increase in cigarette smuggling over the same period.
[02:13:00.377 --> 02:13:06.722]  So now you have a situation where half of all cigarettes consumed within New York State are smuggled
[02:13:07.242 --> 02:13:10.104]  Are, in the eyes of the government, illegal cigarettes.
[02:13:10.564 --> 02:13:23.853]  Because they now have a $4.35 per pack, dollar per pack, tax, in addition to a $1.50 per pack tax for the state, for the city as well, on every pack of cigarettes.
[02:13:23.873 --> 02:13:35.461]  So if this hadn't have been imposed by the likes of Bloomberg, who before the confrontation with Eric Garner, increased police powers to target so-called cigarette smugglers,
[02:13:36.041 --> 02:13:38.462]  This choking death would have never have happened.
[02:13:38.782 --> 02:13:48.227]  So Ghana's death was essentially caused by big government, caused by these punitive, greedy taxes being imposed by the state.
[02:13:48.307 --> 02:13:50.048]  So again, that's a major issue.
[02:13:50.108 --> 02:13:55.050]  These ludicrous taxes, again, are a direct cause of police brutality.
[02:13:55.070 --> 02:13:56.391]  If we really want to address
[02:13:57.031 --> 02:14:00.693]  The issues, the solutions in preventing police brutality.
[02:14:01.053 --> 02:14:03.734]  We need to know how these cases arise in the first place.
[02:14:04.095 --> 02:14:09.357]  And in the case of Ghana, he was basically summarily executed for tax evasion.
[02:14:09.397 --> 02:14:18.022]  So now they've set that precedent that American citizens can be summarily executed, choked to death, for violating some ludicrous tax law.
[02:14:18.642 --> 02:14:26.227]  And we've seen this developing over quite a long period of time with the war on drugs, the massive, massive incarceration.
[02:14:26.307 --> 02:14:30.750]  Again, that's where we also lead the world in terms of our prison population.
[02:14:31.150 --> 02:14:39.596]  The number of people that we have per capita in prison adjusted for population is far greater than it is in communist China or in Russia.
[02:14:40.537 --> 02:14:46.201]  It is, we lead the world and it's not even close with these other people, how many people we've thrown in prison.
[02:14:46.321 --> 02:14:47.842]  And of course, this is where
[02:14:48.582 --> 02:14:58.109]  Those of you who are listening, although we've nearly lost jury trials, if somebody has a jury trial, this is where you can have an effect.
[02:14:58.349 --> 02:15:10.578]  It can only be one situation, perhaps, but you can, as the proverb has, you know, the guy who was picking up the starfish and the beach was littered with starfish who were dying because the water was out.
[02:15:10.618 --> 02:15:12.560]  The guy goes up, picks up one and throws it back in.
[02:15:12.580 --> 02:15:12.940]  The guy says,
[02:15:13.940 --> 02:15:15.401]  Another guy says, how much good is that going to do?
[02:15:15.441 --> 02:15:16.381]  That's just one starfish.
[02:15:16.421 --> 02:15:18.022]  And he goes, yes, but it is one.
[02:15:18.422 --> 02:15:19.963]  That is what you can do as a jury.
[02:15:20.023 --> 02:15:27.425]  You can nullify these outrageous draconian laws and the penalties that come with them, the mandatory minimums.
[02:15:27.766 --> 02:15:30.086]  You can nullify that as a single jury.
[02:15:30.126 --> 02:15:31.207]  You can hang the jury.
[02:15:32.007 --> 02:15:34.049]  You have the right, you have the duty to do that.
[02:15:34.069 --> 02:15:35.169]  It's called jury nullification.
[02:15:35.189 --> 02:15:36.650]  You need to educate yourself about that.
[02:15:36.890 --> 02:15:39.612]  But I want to look at, real quickly Paul, get your reaction to this.
[02:15:39.652 --> 02:15:49.959]  There's a story that was up on Reason two days ago, talking about the San Francisco Police Department and the approach that the police chief there is taking towards the war on drugs.
[02:15:49.979 --> 02:15:55.643]  They said, when San Francisco stopped prosecuting drug users, violent crime went down.
[02:15:56.403 --> 02:16:01.067]  And so they talked to the police chief there and he says he supports drug prohibition.
[02:16:01.107 --> 02:16:01.927]  He says, I'm an ARC.
[02:16:01.967 --> 02:16:03.308]  I've been a narcotics guy forever.
[02:16:03.749 --> 02:16:07.251]  I feel sorry for the people who are addicted to drugs.
[02:16:07.391 --> 02:16:13.016]  However, even though he sees it as a serious public health issue that needs to be addressed,
[02:16:13.556 --> 02:16:16.879]  He is not going out there and escalating the violence.
[02:16:16.919 --> 02:16:23.864]  They say that San Francisco offers an enticing glimpse at what American cities might begin to look like if drugs were legalized or decriminalized.
[02:16:24.204 --> 02:16:28.868]  His department still makes arrests for drug dealings but only on a complaint-driven basis.
[02:16:28.908 --> 02:16:33.592]  They don't go out of their way to set up stings or raids or SWAT raids as we're talking about.
[02:16:33.812 --> 02:16:43.099]  He says we're not trying to keep a stat game going on arresting people for narcotics and it hasn't hurt us trying to achieve our goal and trying to make San Francisco
[02:16:43.779 --> 02:16:44.319]  We're good to go.
[02:17:06.155 --> 02:17:10.559]  Well, I mean, David, we know that ending drug prohibition reduces crime.
[02:17:10.759 --> 02:17:13.522]  Any country that has done it, that's exactly what happened.
[02:17:13.542 --> 02:17:15.984]  I mean, look at Portugal, look at other countries in Europe.
[02:17:16.465 --> 02:17:20.228]  As soon as they start taking those steps, crime is reduced.
[02:17:20.448 --> 02:17:24.092]  And actually, even, I was watching Fox News a couple of days ago.
[02:17:24.472 --> 02:17:30.298]  They had a host and three panel guests who all agreed that the war on drugs has failed.
[02:17:30.778 --> 02:17:38.003]  That it's completely ridiculous that it's just targeting innocent people, wasting money, creating this huge prison industrial complex.
[02:17:38.383 --> 02:17:40.304]  And they all agreed on Fox News!
[02:17:40.764 --> 02:17:42.745]  They all agreed that the war on drugs had to end.
[02:17:43.066 --> 02:17:44.927]  So, I mean, when it gets to that stage, it's over.
[02:17:44.967 --> 02:17:48.369]  We've seen Colorado, their economy is booming as a result.
[02:17:48.889 --> 02:17:50.351]  The legalization of marijuana.
[02:17:50.391 --> 02:17:57.860]  We've seen other states take steps in that direction since the midterms and it's just positive benefits all around.
[02:17:57.900 --> 02:18:01.465]  And if you look at the cases in other countries, it works every time.
[02:18:01.485 --> 02:18:04.609]  So I think that's one front on which we're winning the battle.
[02:18:05.051 --> 02:18:06.752]  That's good, you know, because prohibition doesn't work.
[02:18:06.792 --> 02:18:08.092]  It didn't work with alcohol prohibition.
[02:18:08.452 --> 02:18:15.315]  Even though when they did alcohol prohibition, they had at least enough respect for the Constitution to file two constitutional amendments.
[02:18:15.335 --> 02:18:18.356]  We got one creating alcohol prohibition, another one to repeal it.
[02:18:18.996 --> 02:18:21.377]  Why did they need to have a constitutional amendment?
[02:18:21.997 --> 02:18:28.261]  Because the federal government doesn't have the constitutional authority to tell you what you can own, to tell you what you can put in your body.
[02:18:28.501 --> 02:18:28.761]  You know what?
[02:18:28.781 --> 02:18:32.443]  They don't even have the constitutional authority to mandate insurance to you, do they, Paul?
[02:18:32.463 --> 02:18:34.484]  We're going to be talking more about that.
[02:18:34.785 --> 02:18:38.807]  But I think that's really what's been driving the violence in the last couple of decades.
[02:18:39.087 --> 02:18:40.308]  We've seen the rule of law.
[02:18:40.988 --> 02:18:50.437]  Eroded in terms of civil forfeiture acts where they can seize property, charge the inanimate property with a crime when they never charge the person possessing it with a crime.
[02:18:50.657 --> 02:18:52.278]  Just confiscate stuff, steal stuff.
[02:18:52.319 --> 02:18:53.780]  It breeds corruption.
[02:18:53.920 --> 02:18:55.101]  It's bred violence.
[02:18:55.261 --> 02:18:56.943]  It's a policy that needs to go.
[02:18:57.483 --> 02:18:59.925]  But I think that the reason that they're willing to let it go...
[02:19:00.646 --> 02:19:08.131]  Is because they know they can replace all of this militarized, violent stuff with the war on terror.
[02:19:08.171 --> 02:19:11.334]  I think that's where they're going to put their next focus on.
[02:19:11.434 --> 02:19:21.761]  And I think they're going to continue to do the same types of militarized police unless we push back, unless we can get above this idea that this is simply white against black.
[02:19:21.801 --> 02:19:23.662]  That's the thing that they're trying to sell us.
[02:19:23.702 --> 02:19:25.744]  If we buy into that, we're not going to have reform.
[02:19:27.142 --> 02:19:30.625]  Exactly, and on the jury trials, just quickly, there's a story.
[02:19:31.565 --> 02:19:35.308]  South Carolina jury indicts white officer for killing black man.
[02:19:35.689 --> 02:19:37.970]  Media ignores, that's out of truth revolt.
[02:19:38.311 --> 02:19:46.677]  And basically this was a police chief who back in 2011 had a struggle with an African American in a vehicle, shot him in the chest.
[02:19:47.137 --> 02:19:55.299]  He was unarmed, and this officer has just today, or yesterday, been indicted by a grand jury in South Carolina.
[02:19:55.639 --> 02:20:03.200]  But of course the media is not going to give that any attention, because they're trying to fan the flames of this race war, which again ignores the real problem.
[02:20:03.220 --> 02:20:04.101]  Hang on Paul, we gotta go to break.
[02:20:04.121 --> 02:20:07.101]  We're gonna be right back, and Paul Joseph Weiss and I are gonna take your calls.
[02:20:07.121 --> 02:20:09.062]  I know we've had a lot of people who've been hanging on for a long time.
[02:20:09.082 --> 02:20:10.342]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[02:20:10.782 --> 02:20:13.583]  People's lives and bodies are out of balance.

[02:20:40.476 --> 02:20:41.197]  Hey, Boomer!
[02:20:41.457 --> 02:20:44.799]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[02:20:44.899 --> 02:20:46.480]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[02:20:46.580 --> 02:20:48.321]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[02:20:48.521 --> 02:20:54.044]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[02:20:54.364 --> 02:20:55.104]  I know, right?
[02:20:55.184 --> 02:20:56.145]  You love it, too!
[02:20:56.505 --> 02:20:57.826]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[02:20:57.946 --> 02:20:58.866]  Let's go get some!

[02:21:09.492 --> 02:21:11.213]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[02:21:11.414 --> 02:21:14.736]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[02:21:15.056 --> 02:21:16.037]  A pair of scissors.
[02:21:16.417 --> 02:21:21.922]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for him.
[02:21:22.202 --> 02:21:26.885]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.

[02:23:09.386 --> 02:23:14.469]  The lining of your lungs is supposed to be protected with glutathione to neutralize incoming irritants.
[02:23:14.749 --> 02:23:18.451]  In the absence of enough glutathione, your lungs are more prone to irritation.
[02:23:18.611 --> 02:23:23.734]  Listen to the real-world results of one man using a powerful glutathione-supporting food.
[02:23:23.754 --> 02:23:25.215]  Hi, my name is Bill O'Brien.
[02:23:25.655 --> 02:23:28.357]  I generally suffer through an asthmatic breathing type situation.
[02:23:29.117 --> 02:23:32.000]  My breathing is shallow and generally constricted in the nose and lungs.
[02:23:32.661 --> 02:23:37.886]  After consuming one world weight today, I have tremendous energy and also notice my breathing is free.
[02:23:38.666 --> 02:23:45.012]  I can feel the air in my left nostril and it is free all the way to my abdomen, which is pretty remarkable because I rarely get that feeling.
[02:23:45.673 --> 02:23:47.995]  Being a singer, I love feeling this unrestricted voice.
[02:23:48.749 --> 02:23:51.954]  The only thing new I've actually added to my routine is One World Way.
[02:23:52.555 --> 02:23:52.755]  Wow!

[02:24:21.027 --> 02:24:22.147]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:22.187 --> 02:24:23.127]  I'm David Knight in Austin.
[02:24:23.147 --> 02:24:25.308]  We have Paul Joseph Watson joining us from the UK.
[02:24:25.328 --> 02:24:28.069]  And we've had some callers who've been waiting a very long time.
[02:24:28.089 --> 02:24:29.429]  Several of them over an hour.
[02:24:29.649 --> 02:24:33.570]  One gentleman, the next one, Eric in Texas, has been waiting for nearly two hours.
[02:24:33.630 --> 02:24:36.830]  So, Paul, I want to get his comments and then we'll go to you.
[02:24:37.371 --> 02:24:38.411]  Eric in Texas, go ahead.
[02:24:39.671 --> 02:24:40.511]  Hi, David.
[02:24:41.271 --> 02:24:46.112]  I want to talk about, you know, the corruption in the country and it goes with the police.
[02:24:46.492 --> 02:24:47.973]  I totally agree with Mr. Watson.
[02:24:48.033 --> 02:24:48.833]  He nailed it on the head.
[02:24:49.851 --> 02:24:58.654]  I think what's happening, not only have they taken control of the discussion, you know, we're not allowed to see that, you know, there's corruption in the judicial system as a whole.
[02:24:58.674 --> 02:25:16.180]  You know, the judges, the lawyers, the whole system works with these police, they're bad, and it makes the good ones look bad, and it causes a lot of people on my end, you know, I have a lot of conservative friends, a lot of liberal friends, they're disgusted, and they've decided to just take the cop's side.
[02:25:17.020 --> 02:25:18.401]  And they see it as fine.
[02:25:19.369 --> 02:25:24.531]  And again, I see this as, you know, an attempt to take over the discussion from us.
[02:25:24.571 --> 02:25:26.792]  Remember, Hillary Clinton said we're losing the info war.
[02:25:27.412 --> 02:25:27.632]  Yeah.
[02:25:27.692 --> 02:25:35.555]  I see this as part of a, you know, a desperation act to try to, you know, take it so they maybe, you know, take it back.
[02:25:35.635 --> 02:25:42.278]  But how do we reach people, David, that they refuse to listen, you know, to let's say, you know, we have a black community.
[02:25:42.298 --> 02:25:43.498]  They won't listen to any white people.
[02:25:44.298 --> 02:25:47.102]  We have a white community, they won't listen to anybody liberal.
[02:25:47.382 --> 02:25:50.827]  Whatever the situation, whatever group you live in, we need to come together.
[02:25:52.329 --> 02:25:54.793]  And how do we do that?
[02:25:54.893 --> 02:25:57.376]  Because there's so many people, they're just not going to hear you.
[02:25:57.777 --> 02:25:59.840]  You guys are absolutely right, but you'll never be heard.
[02:26:00.100 --> 02:26:01.981]  Well, they start to bring in nonsense like that.
[02:26:02.141 --> 02:26:10.944]  I remember just a couple of weeks ago there was a big discussion about an Uber executive, you know, the cyber taxi system.
[02:26:11.004 --> 02:26:18.906]  An Uber executive said that he'd like to hire four people to go after a particular journalist, pay him a million dollars to do it, you know, get dirt on her, make it public.
[02:26:18.926 --> 02:26:20.687]  And there was a huge pushback against that.
[02:26:21.687 --> 02:26:26.252]  This journalist started turning it into sexism instead of attacking people.
[02:26:26.272 --> 02:26:30.476]  That's a very underhanded suggestion to do something like that.
[02:26:30.496 --> 02:26:40.186]  It's against our First Amendment, but it really showed the character that they would do something like that or even think that that would be a reasonable thing to do as a guy put at force.
[02:26:40.206 --> 02:26:44.871]  But then when they started talking about it as sexism, it basically lost all momentum.
[02:26:45.051 --> 02:26:51.853]  And when they start talking about this as being simply a racist issue, then we take reform off of the table.
[02:26:52.254 --> 02:26:54.815]  And that's really what Eric Holder is doing.
[02:26:54.835 --> 02:26:57.976]  He's now promising to end racial profiling once and for all.
[02:26:58.036 --> 02:27:03.638]  He's going to institute rigorous new standards and robust safeguards to help end racial profiling once and for all.
[02:27:04.198 --> 02:27:08.139]  It's about a problem that's much bigger than that, and I'll let Paul comment on that.
[02:27:08.159 --> 02:27:12.401]  But I think when I looked at that video that was up the other day, this is what happens when you call the cops.
[02:27:12.941 --> 02:27:15.463]  He was showing the abuse on white people as well.
[02:27:15.503 --> 02:27:19.547]  He was even showing CPS abuse, Child Protective Services abuse.
[02:27:19.607 --> 02:27:26.092]  And of course we have the article today about the couple had their children confiscated after their home birth.
[02:27:26.172 --> 02:27:30.456]  Some people reported them because they gave birth at home and the CPS people start coming there.
[02:27:30.496 --> 02:27:32.858]  That's their probable cause to intrude into their family.
[02:27:33.098 --> 02:27:37.361]  Then they start nitpicking their lives and next thing you know they've confiscated their children.
[02:27:37.422 --> 02:27:39.183]  So Paul, how do we get this
[02:27:40.584 --> 02:27:44.707]  Narrative away from them, this narrative that they're trying to sell everybody, that it's simply racism.
[02:27:45.748 --> 02:27:57.497]  Well, I mean, the federal government routinely makes a big show about, you know, federal investigations, Justice Department investigations, no matter what your take on Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown or Eric Garner.
[02:27:57.938 --> 02:28:00.239]  Those federal investigations go nowhere.
[02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:04.042]  The Trayvon Martin federal investigation is still open.
[02:28:04.503 --> 02:28:06.825]  And by all accounts, it's completely fruitless.
[02:28:06.885 --> 02:28:08.466]  It's not even coming to any conclusion.
[02:28:09.046 --> 02:28:28.469]  Again, proving they don't care about justice, but they're right there on the scene in the very first moments inciting the race war, like Obama was saying that the anger in response to the Michael Brown case was justified, when if you actually look at the evidence and the facts of the case, not the emotional manipulation and the media narrative,
[02:28:28.909 --> 02:28:39.817]  Then the anger in that one specific case was not justified based on the evidence, the autopsy results, the ballistic evidence, which backed up Officer Wilson's version of what happened.
[02:28:40.178 --> 02:28:43.480]  It would be justified in the Eric Garner case, and that's the point I've made.
[02:28:43.880 --> 02:28:51.826]  You know, I've been steadfast and consistent in supporting a judgment based on facts and evidence, not on emotional manipulation.
[02:28:51.866 --> 02:28:52.447]  So whereas I
[02:28:53.087 --> 02:28:55.368]  Agreed with the grand jury verdict in the Brown case.
[02:28:55.448 --> 02:28:57.449]  I disagree with it in the Garner case.
[02:28:57.509 --> 02:29:02.631]  Because again, I'm not influenced by this media narrative which is pushing race and division.
[02:29:02.931 --> 02:29:11.435]  I think we need to elevate the black voices that are speaking out against both violence within police departments and violence within the black community.
[02:29:11.915 --> 02:29:25.605]  Because they've got the most credibility and hopefully the social justice warriors who get distracted by white privilege and all these other distractions will pay heed to those prominent black voices like Charles Barkley.
[02:29:26.125 --> 02:29:27.886]  We heard the same criticisms of the Bundy Ranch.
[02:29:27.926 --> 02:29:30.828]  We heard people say, well you show up here but you're not going to show up at the inner city.
[02:29:30.868 --> 02:29:32.870]  We did show up at the inner city with our reporters and you know what?
[02:29:33.550 --> 02:29:40.133]  There were volunteers who showed up at the Bundy Ranch to constrain the violence there that was being conducted by the federal government.
[02:29:40.333 --> 02:29:47.455]  And we also had volunteers, Oath Keepers, show up to protect private businesses in Ferguson.
[02:29:47.495 --> 02:29:50.497]  And of course, they were shut down, mainly, by the feds.
[02:29:50.517 --> 02:29:51.397]  We're going to be right back.
[02:29:51.737 --> 02:29:52.477]  Hang on through the break.
[02:29:52.597 --> 02:29:57.999]  Eric, if there's anything else that you wanted to follow up with, since you've waited so long, I'll take your call if you want to hang on through the break.
[02:29:58.360 --> 02:29:58.940]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:59.775 --> 02:30:02.784]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.726 --> 02:30:06.414]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:31:28.831 --> 02:31:37.915]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:31:38.115 --> 02:31:43.518]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.

[02:32:44.100 --> 02:32:48.082]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:32:48.382 --> 02:32:49.843]  Can you put two and two together?

[02:33:05.811 --> 02:33:08.613]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:33:13.343 --> 02:33:17.946]  For 50 years, we've told them what to eat, what to drink, what to wear!
[02:33:18.286 --> 02:33:20.468]  For Christ's sake, Ben, don't you understand?
[02:33:20.928 --> 02:33:22.789]  Americans love television!
[02:33:23.190 --> 02:33:24.831]  They wean their kids on it!
[02:33:25.351 --> 02:33:30.335]  Listen, they love game shows, they love wrestling, they love sports and violence!
[02:33:31.335 --> 02:33:32.196]  So what do we do?
[02:33:33.557 --> 02:33:35.078]  We give them what they want!
[02:33:36.770 --> 02:33:37.991]  We're number one, Ben.
[02:33:38.511 --> 02:33:39.451]  That's all that counts.
[02:33:40.051 --> 02:33:42.692]  Believe me, I've been in the business 30 years.
[02:33:43.192 --> 02:33:45.873]  Well, I haven't been in show business as long as you have, Killian.
[02:33:46.834 --> 02:33:47.874]  But I'm a quick learner.
[02:33:48.934 --> 02:33:51.535]  So I'm going to give the audience what I think they want.
[02:33:52.756 --> 02:33:58.818]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[02:34:04.460 --> 02:34:05.260]  Alright, we're back.
[02:34:06.551 --> 02:34:11.876]  Arnold Schwarzenegger's not back, but I'm David Knight, I'm back, and I've got Paul Joseph Watson from the UK back.
[02:34:12.877 --> 02:34:20.325]  And before we go back to our caller, Eric in Texas, I want to tell you that we have a huge sale going on this week at InfoWars store.
[02:34:20.365 --> 02:34:29.694]  We have our Cyber Week Christmas specials, free shipping storewide on everything that you buy, as well as a huge, huge discount off of our Prison Planet membership.
[02:34:30.254 --> 02:34:32.436]  Normally $59.99, now only $29.95.
[02:34:32.856 --> 02:34:39.562]  That's one year membership and you get seven months free at that price.
[02:34:39.602 --> 02:34:41.484]  That's only $2.50 a month.
[02:34:42.124 --> 02:34:44.946]  And you can now share that with 20 other friends.
[02:34:44.986 --> 02:34:47.769]  To see the news each night as we cover it, each weekday night,
[02:34:48.329 --> 02:34:51.431]  As it happens, it starts at 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[02:34:51.511 --> 02:34:56.814]  Eastern, and of course, that helps to support our entire operation, the reporters, all of us here.
[02:34:57.535 --> 02:34:59.336]  We also have silver is back.
[02:34:59.556 --> 02:35:02.738]  We have 20% off of silver, and of course, free shipping in a limited amount.
[02:35:02.858 --> 02:35:06.680]  That will also sell out soon, and it's going to take a while for us to get that back in.
[02:35:07.100 --> 02:35:07.981]  This is cold season.
[02:35:08.021 --> 02:35:14.825]  This is a good time to have a stock of silver, and you can never have enough preparation for this time of year.
[02:35:14.885 --> 02:35:16.546]  We also have a super prep pack.
[02:35:16.986 --> 02:35:18.947]  That's Silver Bullet and Survival Shield.
[02:35:18.967 --> 02:35:19.968]  That's $15 off.
[02:35:20.368 --> 02:35:23.891]  And if you buy four Silver Bullets, you get one free.
[02:35:24.411 --> 02:35:25.672]  We also have DNA Force.
[02:35:25.712 --> 02:35:27.534]  Get two bottles of Survival Shield free.
[02:35:27.894 --> 02:35:28.934]  A $60 value.
[02:35:28.975 --> 02:35:33.918]  We have 30% off all Super Female and Super Male products.
[02:35:33.978 --> 02:35:36.320]  That's on our store, InfoWars store.
[02:35:36.920 --> 02:35:39.182]  And you can see that right there on our website.
[02:35:40.089 --> 02:35:43.592]  Now going back to Eric in Texas, I know Eric you held on for a long time.
[02:35:43.612 --> 02:35:56.541]  You were talking about how frustrating it was to try to get your friends, both conservative and liberal, to really see what the issue is here because they are being blinded and misdirected by this red herring of racism.
[02:35:56.861 --> 02:36:02.385]  They're not seeing that this is a much broader, much deeper problem than merely racism.
[02:36:02.585 --> 02:36:02.765]  I think?
[02:36:23.860 --> 02:36:30.402]  Let's send more white people to prison, or let's send less black people to prison for violation of drug prohibition.
[02:36:30.442 --> 02:36:36.424]  Let's look at drug prohibition, for example, and say, this is wrong, we shouldn't be sending anybody to prison, black or white.
[02:36:36.464 --> 02:36:37.605]  What are your comments, Eric?
[02:36:38.845 --> 02:36:41.406]  I think you guys are absolutely fantastic and correct.
[02:36:41.746 --> 02:36:50.689]  I had a simple idea, it probably didn't originate from me, but how do we, I mean, is it possible we can take people like Professor Griff, you know, the real Rick Ross, the real guy,
[02:36:51.603 --> 02:36:56.085]  And send them on a little tour, like a small tour, you know, maybe five cities or just see how it goes.
[02:36:56.105 --> 02:36:57.766]  And send them to inner cities.
[02:36:57.806 --> 02:36:59.226]  Let them talk to the kids.
[02:36:59.607 --> 02:37:03.948]  Let them talk to the violent people, you know, that we really need to change.
[02:37:04.028 --> 02:37:06.770]  Because there's plenty of good people in those black communities.
[02:37:06.810 --> 02:37:08.430]  You don't hear them on the TV.
[02:37:08.771 --> 02:37:11.192]  And they've had the courage to come on our show and talk about that.
[02:37:11.212 --> 02:37:14.033]  And as a matter of fact, Rick Ross was going around in Texas here.
[02:37:14.053 --> 02:37:15.814]  That's when Josh went around and filmed him.
[02:37:15.834 --> 02:37:17.114]  That's part of our report that we put up.
[02:37:17.154 --> 02:37:17.714]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:37:17.734 --> 02:37:19.035]  That's a very important message to get out.
[02:37:20.506 --> 02:37:22.907]  Yes, thank you.
[02:37:23.487 --> 02:37:25.108]  Thank you very much, Eric in Texas.
[02:37:25.128 --> 02:37:26.909]  Let's go to Chris in Nevada.
[02:37:26.929 --> 02:37:27.509]  Go ahead, Chris.
[02:37:29.650 --> 02:37:31.450]  Well, good morning, David and Paul.
[02:37:32.591 --> 02:37:33.031]  Good morning.
[02:37:33.151 --> 02:37:33.751]  What's on your mind?
[02:37:34.972 --> 02:37:47.977]  Well, I'm a former multi-jurisdictional law enforcement professional myself, having served in four different distinct jurisdictions and attended four of their different and separate training academies.
[02:37:49.404 --> 02:38:05.474]  I wanted to comment on the devised misinterpretation or made to be misinterpreted word term crime that is set forth in the probable cause description.
[02:38:07.275 --> 02:38:12.298]  Probable cause is described as the facts or circumstances that would cause a reasonable man to
[02:38:14.426 --> 02:38:20.427]  Conclude that one, a crime has been committed, and two, the person accused committed said crime.
[02:38:22.068 --> 02:38:40.912]  However, the word term crime has a specifically delineated meaning, constituting that of a felony criminal nature set forth in the case Thompson v. Smith, which says for a law enforcement officer to have a municipal purpose
[02:38:41.644 --> 02:39:08.486]  To be in the presence of an individual to make further inquiry, he must be able to articulate with extreme specificity the facts or circumstances that would cause him to conclude that, one, a particular felony crime had been committed, and two, the circumstances that would cause him to conclude that the person he was stopping had some reasonable basis for relating to that felony crime.
[02:39:09.440 --> 02:39:12.402]  Okay, so what do you think about these two indictments here?
[02:39:12.442 --> 02:39:14.082]  What's your opinion of them?
[02:39:14.403 --> 02:39:15.983]  Should there have been grand jury indictments?
[02:39:17.464 --> 02:39:24.648]  Well, what you're seeing there is what's referred to in law as Lex Locam Tori, the local law of the emperor.
[02:39:25.348 --> 02:39:28.310]  Common Parliance is called hometown.
[02:39:29.250 --> 02:39:37.655]  Whenever the jurisdiction that you're in is paid for, all the police, the prosecutors, the judges,
[02:39:38.832 --> 02:39:42.833]  Uh, has their variable financial liability on the line.
[02:39:42.974 --> 02:39:51.597]  It's to their particular interest to have the pre-concluded accumulation of the grand jury or purported.
[02:39:51.997 --> 02:39:55.878]  It's probably a jury trial rather than a trial by jury specifically.
[02:39:56.558 --> 02:40:01.200]  But the, like you observed, in fact, I really have to compliment Lionel that was on here earlier.
[02:40:01.220 --> 02:40:05.561]  He was an immensely knowledgeable, experienced prosecutor, but he is more of a defender.
[02:40:08.004 --> 02:40:22.997]  These insinuations for the prosecution in league with the judge in their particular court can put their thumb on the scales of justice and use their prosecutorial and judicial discretion
[02:40:23.840 --> 02:40:40.508]  To influence the presentment and of course the counties have unlimited resources to develop the evidence and pick and choose or cherry pick the evidence that's most effectuous to the presentment of their point or political agenda that they wish to put forth to the jury.
[02:40:40.788 --> 02:40:54.039]  Yeah, and going to that, in the case in Ferguson, Missouri, for example, what we have learned as some of these records have been released, and they're typically not released at a grand jury, is we learn things like Darren Wilson was allowed to wipe any and all blood off of himself.
[02:40:54.099 --> 02:41:04.088]  He was allowed to wipe off the gun, which was a key part of the story, that he was wrestling with Michael Brown with his gun, and he was able to wipe that off.
[02:41:04.128 --> 02:41:07.671]  So they couldn't verify that they had any fingerprints of Michael Brown on the gun.
[02:41:08.251 --> 02:41:10.172]  We also know they didn't record the conversation.
[02:41:10.212 --> 02:41:20.879]  We know that the officer who investigated the scene of the crime said he didn't really see any need to measure the distance between the police car, the police officer, and Michael Brown when he was shot.
[02:41:21.639 --> 02:41:28.023]  All of these things start to come out of the grand jury trial, and so you look at this and you say, well, did we really have a fair hearing here?
[02:41:28.423 --> 02:41:34.407]  I think that what's going to happen is, certainly, it's going to move to a civil venue and there's still going to be some liability there.
[02:41:34.427 --> 02:41:37.689]  Of course, the taxpayers will be the ones who will wind up paying that, but I wonder
[02:41:38.229 --> 02:41:52.888]  If these guys were criminally convicted, these police officers, because of their training, because of the way they've been equipped and trained, I wonder if they would in turn sue the city for damages because they were doing what they were trained to do.
[02:41:53.248 --> 02:41:54.450]  Paul, did you want to comment on this?
[02:41:55.939 --> 02:42:02.683]  Yeah, just on the Brown case, I mean, the ballistics and the blood splatter show that Brown's blood was on Wilson's gun.
[02:42:03.124 --> 02:42:15.992]  The autopsy results also show that Brown's thumb was grazed by a bullet, which directly suggests that there was a struggle for the gun and that Brown tried to grab Wilson's gun, backing up Wilson's testimony.
[02:42:16.692 --> 02:42:17.793]  Also, the eyewitnesses
[02:42:18.513 --> 02:42:33.948]  Many of them told the police that they were intimidated by other people living in the immediate area to verify this myth that was created by Brown's accomplice in the robbery of the convenience store, which was that Brown had his hands up when he was shot.
[02:42:34.568 --> 02:42:37.511]  The autopsy results again say that that's false.
[02:42:37.831 --> 02:42:40.794]  They say that the claim that he was shot in the back is false.
[02:42:40.814 --> 02:42:45.518]  So a bunch of witnesses basically got caught lying and then the ballistics, the blood spatter.
[02:42:46.479 --> 02:42:55.146]  The autopsy results do back up Wilson's account which is why I base my judgment on that evidence and which I believe is why the grand jury acquitted Wilson.
[02:42:55.166 --> 02:42:59.430]  Yeah, I don't really want to get into, you know, rehashing all the details of the trial and everything.
[02:42:59.490 --> 02:43:00.231]  I think though what
[02:43:01.368 --> 02:43:06.414]  The documents that we've seen come out of the grand jury, I think, show that there's a very different standard of evidence.
[02:43:06.434 --> 02:43:18.168]  For example, if I, as a private citizen, were involved in a shooting and I wiped all the fingerprints off the gun, that might, in and of itself, be probable cause to have a
[02:43:18.889 --> 02:43:20.711]  A murder trial or something for me.
[02:43:20.751 --> 02:43:22.612]  So there's a very different standard of evidence.
[02:43:22.912 --> 02:43:44.450]  There's a very different, actually they have a law enforcement Bill of Rights that was put in by Senator Joe Biden after multiple times that give a very different approach, a very different presumption, special protections with the police unions and other things that allow the police to actually have a second, a superior Bill of Rights, which of course they don't pay much attention to our Bill of Rights.
[02:43:44.790 --> 02:43:59.281]  But they get a special privileged approach to all this, and that's what I see coming out of some of these records, coming out of the grand jury, which I think is more relevant in the broader scheme of things, whether or not Officer Wilson was justified in that.
[02:43:59.301 --> 02:44:14.493]  And again, I don't want to make it so much about Wilson versus Brown or Black versus White, because this is a very broad problem, and we have a lot of systemic bias, a lot of systemic corruption, and we have a lot of systemic training for violence that's going on in this.
[02:44:14.693 --> 02:44:16.674]  Let's go to Sean in Tennessee.
[02:44:16.714 --> 02:44:17.334]  Sean, go ahead.
[02:44:18.875 --> 02:44:19.595]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:44:19.715 --> 02:44:21.416]  I'm a former police officer.
[02:44:21.436 --> 02:44:27.458]  I also help teach Constitution and Statutory Law at the Upper East Tennessee Research Institute.
[02:44:27.558 --> 02:44:30.079]  One thing I wanted to talk about was the fact that jurisdiction.
[02:44:30.599 --> 02:44:37.442]  We keep talking about all these entities getting away with everything they're doing, including militarization of the police nowadays.
[02:44:38.283 --> 02:44:44.628]  The problem is, like in the Money Rant issue, remember he kept saying, I don't have a contract with the federal government and they don't have jurisdiction.
[02:44:44.808 --> 02:44:44.989]  Yes.
[02:44:45.489 --> 02:44:52.795]  The FBI cannot write you a speeding ticket on a roadway because they only have jurisdiction within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.
[02:44:52.975 --> 02:44:53.175]  Yes.
[02:44:53.415 --> 02:44:54.957]  And that is Washington, D.C.
[02:44:55.817 --> 02:45:00.781]  And we keep believing the myth that the United States of America and the United States are the same thing.
[02:45:00.821 --> 02:45:03.824]  And in the Articles of Confederation and in the Constitution, they're not.
[02:45:04.488 --> 02:45:05.469]  That's a very good point.
[02:45:05.609 --> 02:45:13.156]  When I was at the Bundy Ranch, one of the things that, you know, the thing they were most concerned about was the violence that was being perpetrated against people.
[02:45:13.616 --> 02:45:19.862]  And that morning that they had the standoff later on in the day, that morning when Sheriff Gillespie showed up at the Bundy Ranch,
[02:45:21.536 --> 02:45:26.158]  Cliven Bundy said to him, I want you to confiscate the weapons of the BLM.
[02:45:26.418 --> 02:45:31.161]  I want you to open up these roadblocks into these areas because you are the one with jurisdiction.
[02:45:31.221 --> 02:45:33.102]  I'm going to wait a couple hours for you to do this.
[02:45:33.162 --> 02:45:38.564]  And when he didn't do it, that's when he said, let's go get our cattle back because the sheriff wasn't going to do anything.
[02:45:38.684 --> 02:45:41.125]  It's local law enforcement that has the jurisdiction.
[02:45:41.145 --> 02:45:42.126]  You're absolutely right, Sean.
[02:45:43.530 --> 02:45:46.451]  Um, if you don't mind, there's a famous case.
[02:45:46.471 --> 02:45:48.171]  It's called Barron versus the City of Baltimore.
[02:45:48.191 --> 02:45:50.132]  A lot of us believe we have constitutional rights.
[02:45:50.192 --> 02:45:51.212]  We don't.
[02:45:51.232 --> 02:45:54.613]  As men, we are above the Constitution and outside of it.
[02:45:54.653 --> 02:46:00.715]  The Constitution was written for the United States as a limitation on their power, not a grantor of ours.
[02:46:00.815 --> 02:46:05.297]  We have unalienable rights, numerated in the Declaration from the Creator.
[02:46:05.817 --> 02:46:09.478]  And as long as we don't harm anyone, there is no crime.
[02:46:09.798 --> 02:46:12.199]  They can't charge you with marijuana and stuff like that.
[02:46:13.019 --> 02:46:14.641]  When I did that, I didn't understand that.
[02:46:14.701 --> 02:46:23.008]  Cops don't understand that code is under the Uniform Commercial Code, and that laws and codes are two totally different things.
[02:46:23.048 --> 02:46:23.789]  They are not.
[02:46:24.190 --> 02:46:35.440]  A code is a copyrighted, private copyrighted list of codes and regulations for a particular jurisdiction, and it's only applicable to corporations, states, and attorneys.
[02:46:36.340 --> 02:46:40.102]  The Bar Association is not a license to practice law.
[02:46:40.162 --> 02:46:43.083]  We had a law for a hundred years before the bar ever existed.
[02:46:43.563 --> 02:46:51.907]  The problem is that the American people have become completely ignorant as to who they are, and they're supposed to be above the government.
[02:46:51.947 --> 02:46:52.908]  We don't complain.
[02:46:53.208 --> 02:46:57.590]  As men and women, we file claims on their oath of office.
[02:46:58.190 --> 02:46:58.691]  Absolutely.
[02:46:58.711 --> 02:46:59.832]  You're absolutely right.
[02:46:59.852 --> 02:47:02.694]  We have those rights from God and we established
[02:47:16.345 --> 02:47:21.849]  The government and the Constitution to protect those rights and they've turned this upside down.
[02:47:22.209 --> 02:47:27.834]  Sean, you're going to really enjoy the interview that we had with Greg Morris about this entire banking system.
[02:47:28.234 --> 02:47:38.021]  I mean, this thing is like the Iran Contra going from the very beginning where they break the chain of title all the way to the funding the black ops through the Swiss banks.
[02:47:39.102 --> 02:47:53.599]  That's a very important process and one of the things that's very important about this interview and what Greg Morse is trying to do and this is someone who was involved in the early days of the savings and loan crisis and that is to force a review of this illegal operation that they're doing.
[02:47:54.079 --> 02:47:54.399]  No, no, no.
[02:48:16.949 --> 02:48:17.129]  Yes, hi.
[02:48:17.149 --> 02:48:19.991]  I just recently turned 18 and I kind of did a shadow program with our local police station
[02:48:48.437 --> 02:49:00.690]  And well, basically, it was outrageous some of the stuff that they taught me and some of the stuff they were teaching the other shadowers that were, that drove around with the cops and hung out in the police station.
[02:49:00.770 --> 02:49:06.216]  And well, just any questions that you have for me about when I was in the program.
[02:49:07.657 --> 02:49:10.641]  Well, so you're basically following them around like a career day, right?
[02:49:11.835 --> 02:49:13.016]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:49:13.056 --> 02:49:18.258]  Okay, tell us one thing that was the most, you said you were outraged by what happened, what was the most outrageous thing that you saw?
[02:49:20.039 --> 02:49:30.944]  Well, one night, it was, I think, 9.15 at night, there was a group of, I think, four or five teenagers outside of a McDonald's, and one of them took off running.
[02:49:31.164 --> 02:49:36.447]  And they obviously were dealing drugs or something, and it turned out to be a dying bag of weed
[02:49:37.620 --> 02:49:42.904]  I got out of the car and said, you know, stop, you know, and then Deputy McCain came out.
[02:49:44.105 --> 02:49:51.692]  He didn't shoot him, but he got the taser and shot a, I think he was a 15 year old boy, shot him with a taser.
[02:49:52.653 --> 02:49:57.697]  And he sat there and, you know, twitched out, man, literally.
[02:49:59.528 --> 02:50:03.910]  Well, we have a situation here in Texas, right outside of Austin, is down in Bastrop.
[02:50:04.470 --> 02:50:11.774]  They had a fight that was going on, and between a couple of people, a third party got between them, according to witnesses, and broke that up.
[02:50:11.814 --> 02:50:16.496]  And then you see videotape of a cop just walking up and tasering that kid.
[02:50:17.396 --> 02:50:19.118]  Not really assessing the situation.
[02:50:19.238 --> 02:50:19.918]  Tasering him.
[02:50:19.978 --> 02:50:21.860]  He falls down on the concrete floor.
[02:50:22.320 --> 02:50:22.900]  Brain damage.
[02:50:22.941 --> 02:50:24.222]  Still in a coma, I believe.
[02:50:24.262 --> 02:50:26.223]  That's a lawsuit that's working its way through.
[02:50:26.323 --> 02:50:28.345]  So, that's something.
[02:50:28.365 --> 02:50:31.367]  You shadowed the cops as part of your school program.
[02:50:31.848 --> 02:50:36.191]  I think that's an important thing for people to understand what's going on.
[02:50:36.231 --> 02:50:39.033]  To look at the rules that they're giving them.
[02:50:39.093 --> 02:50:40.214]  To engage the public.
[02:50:40.775 --> 02:50:43.817]  And have a real discussion about what appropriate use of force is.
[02:50:43.877 --> 02:50:45.018]  And I hear the music coming in.
[02:50:45.058 --> 02:50:45.839]  We've got to go to
[02:50:46.679 --> 02:50:49.522]  Go to a break, but I'm going to come back and give Paul a chance to talk.
[02:50:49.562 --> 02:50:52.284]  Thank you so much, Jacob in Ohio.
[02:50:52.304 --> 02:50:54.566]  We're going to go to George in Connecticut right after the break.
[02:50:54.586 --> 02:50:54.967]  Stay with us.

[02:51:25.490 --> 02:51:27.550]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.

[02:51:40.464 --> 02:51:41.284]  This is an alert.
[02:51:41.564 --> 02:51:45.525]  If your business or church is building this year, you're about to pay more than you should.
[02:51:45.665 --> 02:51:49.726]  This could mean thousands of dollars more for your office, retail space, church, or warehouse.
[02:51:49.866 --> 02:51:55.147]  A General Steel building can save you as much as half the cost and time of similar conventional construction.

[02:52:22.125 --> 02:52:25.730]  A Big Berkey water filter gives them protection from bacteria, heavy metals,
[02:52:26.010 --> 02:52:29.493]  Chlorine, fluoride, pesticides and herbicides, VOCs and more.
[02:52:29.753 --> 02:52:35.098]  And best of all, a big Berkey water filter is a gift that lasts for many years with no additional investment.
[02:52:35.339 --> 02:52:39.082]  And that saves time and money in filter replacements that other water filters require.
[02:52:39.402 --> 02:52:44.447]  And are even powerful enough to purify treated, untreated or even stagnant pond water.

[02:54:25.188 --> 02:54:26.469]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:26.549 --> 02:54:27.089]  I'm David Knight.
[02:54:27.109 --> 02:54:28.770]  I have Paul Joseph Watson in the UK.
[02:54:29.350 --> 02:54:30.690]  And we've been taking callers.
[02:54:31.031 --> 02:54:32.911]  George in Connecticut, I know you've been holding for a while.
[02:54:33.131 --> 02:54:36.033]  I want to get back to you and Overdrive and the other callers that are there.
[02:54:36.313 --> 02:54:38.214]  I've only got Paul for this one last segment.
[02:54:38.434 --> 02:54:47.017]  And I wanted to get his take on what Obama is proposing in the wake of these high-profile police violence cases.
[02:54:47.758 --> 02:54:49.859]  We've had him propose $263 million for body cameras.
[02:54:54.061 --> 02:55:10.373]  We see that Eric Holder says he can end racism with racist quotas and now we've got a police chief that's going to chair the 21st century committee on chairing on 21st century policing task force that has a real troubled past.
[02:55:11.173 --> 02:55:13.275]  This is a police chief
[02:55:13.855 --> 02:55:15.796]  Who is the police chief of Philadelphia.
[02:55:15.856 --> 02:55:25.379]  He, on his watch they say, and this is in the AntiMedia.org, they say a federal investigation into corruption was launched over a conspiracy, robbery, extortion, kidnapping and drug dealing.
[02:55:25.959 --> 02:55:30.321]  That's the guy you picked to chair your task force on 21st century policing.
[02:55:30.741 --> 02:55:36.303]  They say the Philadelphia police were also caught ignoring thousands of rape cases to keep their crime numbers low.
[02:55:36.543 --> 02:55:39.444]  What I talked about earlier in the program going on in the New York Police Department.
[02:55:40.085 --> 02:55:53.023]  And even though marijuana was decriminalized, he is still saying that he's going to continue to arrest people pursuant to Pennsylvania law, even though they decriminalized it there in Philadelphia.
[02:55:53.063 --> 02:55:55.546]  Paul, your reaction on Obama's solutions?
[02:55:56.837 --> 02:56:12.933]  Well, of course, the body camera solution has been rendered completely invalid by this Eric Garner case where the guy who filmed the choking death himself was indicted and the cop wasn't, so that's gone completely out of the window, that doesn't even matter anymore.
[02:56:13.293 --> 02:56:13.834]  That's right.
[02:56:14.555 --> 02:56:19.199]  As far as racist quotas, what, are they gonna arrest more white people to get the quotas up?
[02:56:19.259 --> 02:56:20.721]  I mean, what kind of solution is that?
[02:56:21.061 --> 02:56:33.417]  Yeah, because we have these private prisons that are guaranteed to have a certain occupancy rate, so if they're going to arrest fewer black people, I guess we're going to have to get more of everybody else to fill up these prisons, because we've got this private prison military-industrial complex.
[02:56:34.414 --> 02:56:40.220]  Well, you know, there's some interesting stats that have just come out of the Centre on Juvenile and Criminal Justice Department.
[02:56:40.741 --> 02:56:42.363]  In 2012, 123 blacks were killed by police with a gun.
[02:56:42.383 --> 02:56:45.066]  And in the same year, 326 whites were killed by police with a gun.
[02:56:51.192 --> 02:57:00.617]  So if you take out Hispanics from that white total, that is generally in coordination with the population of white and black people in America.
[02:57:01.037 --> 02:57:05.159]  Including Hispanics, whites are about 70% of the population, blacks are about 13%.
[02:57:06.560 --> 02:57:15.024]  So if those stats are accurate out of the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice Department, which says that police killings of blacks are down 70% in the last 50 years,
[02:57:17.305 --> 02:57:20.408]  Then again, it emphasises the point that this is not about race.
[02:57:20.868 --> 02:57:36.060]  This is about police brutality, which is what I've tried to emphasise all along, but that's what the social justice warriors are taking the focus away from that, making it about white people and white privilege when it's about violence.
[02:57:36.420 --> 02:57:40.045]  And of course they can take this in any direction they want to, to avoid any kind of reform.
[02:57:40.506 --> 02:57:46.715]  We also, you're talking about how futile it is to say that body cameras are going to actually stop anything.
[02:57:46.936 --> 02:57:50.541]  We saw the murder of that homeless man outside of Albuquerque.
[02:57:50.561 --> 02:57:51.743]  We saw that on a body camera.
[02:57:52.043 --> 02:57:57.429]  We've seen the two recent shootings, one of a guy in Walmart who was going to buy a BB gun.
[02:57:57.709 --> 02:57:58.890]  We saw that on video.
[02:57:59.110 --> 02:58:00.812]  He was shot by cops without warning.
[02:58:01.032 --> 02:58:03.995]  We saw a 12-year-old who had a BB gun, shot by cops.
[02:58:04.215 --> 02:58:06.237]  We saw that on video, shot without warning.
[02:58:06.678 --> 02:58:09.961]  And in both of those cases, the amazing thing is, even though they were holding BB guns...
[02:58:10.919 --> 02:58:23.250]  People turned the direction onto the BB guns and said, well we shouldn't even have toy guns because people are getting killed with toy guns, so let's ban the toy guns instead of addressing cops who show up on the scene shooting first.
[02:58:24.512 --> 02:58:27.413]  Exactly, and in the case of the 12-year-old, I mean, he was shot instantly.
[02:58:27.433 --> 02:58:28.633]  There was no hesitation whatsoever.
[02:58:28.653 --> 02:58:29.093]  Absolutely.
[02:58:29.333 --> 02:58:29.673]  Absolutely.
[02:58:29.693 --> 02:58:30.953]  He jumps out, and it was a rookie.
[02:58:31.254 --> 02:58:32.794]  That's what they're training the rookies to do.
[02:58:33.074 --> 02:58:34.094]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:58:34.154 --> 02:58:35.514]  Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[02:58:36.215 --> 02:58:37.675]  Stay with us right after the break.
[02:58:37.835 --> 02:58:43.136]  In Overdrive, we're going to take the people who've been holding on call, try to get as many of those as we can through.
[02:58:43.156 --> 02:58:43.716]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:53.027 --> 02:58:56.996]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:59:00.532 --> 02:59:06.694]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:59:06.774 --> 02:59:09.375]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:59:09.395 --> 02:59:16.217]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:59:16.477 --> 02:59:19.338]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:59:19.458 --> 02:59:22.419]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:59:22.499 --> 02:59:24.420]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:59:24.440 --> 02:59:27.261]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:59:27.381 --> 02:59:32.883]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:59:33.103 --> 02:59:36.585]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:59:36.605 --> 02:59:39.586]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[02:59:57.294 --> 02:59:58.334]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:22.802 --> 03:00:23.723]  Fix bayonets.
[03:00:24.324 --> 03:00:31.332]  We are now entering overdrive with your host Alex Jones broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:00:31.892 --> 03:00:35.537]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:41.787 --> 03:00:43.249]  Welcome back to Overdrive.
[03:00:43.289 --> 03:00:47.214]  I wanted to get some of the callers who've been waiting a long time patiently.
[03:00:47.234 --> 03:00:50.858]  I wanted to finish up with Paul Joseph Watson while I still had him in the UK.
[03:00:50.878 --> 03:00:54.783]  But let's go to your calls and see if we can get through as many as we can here.
[03:00:54.843 --> 03:00:55.744]  George in Connecticut.
[03:00:57.375 --> 03:01:15.380]  Hi Paul, I was listening to Curtis Sliwa and Ron Cooby at a New York station, I think it's syndicated throughout the United States, and they were talking about the issues and they said they had an expert on there that was sort of neutral, he wasn't pro-cop, whatever he's been
[03:01:15.880 --> 03:01:16.481]  I don't see.
[03:01:36.417 --> 03:01:37.198]  Yeah.
[03:01:37.218 --> 03:01:38.478]  Oh yeah, as Paul pointed out...
[03:02:02.495 --> 03:02:08.797]  We've had more in one year than they've had in the entire history of policing in the UK, and they've got a much longer history of policing there than we do here.
[03:02:09.838 --> 03:02:17.881]  And I've had incidents with police in Japan because I lived there several years, and even started yelling at a cop because he kept bothering me every time I went by.
[03:02:18.181 --> 03:02:20.382]  He thought all white guys look the same, you know?
[03:02:21.122 --> 03:02:23.443]  I'd tell him, we don't look the same, can't you remember?
[03:02:25.290 --> 03:02:26.991]  Yeah, that's part of the problem.
[03:02:27.311 --> 03:02:34.935]  Well, you know, Lionel said that, uh, pointed out that in many states, if it's a felony, they'll go straight for a trial.
[03:02:34.975 --> 03:02:36.776]  They don't go through the grand jury process.
[03:02:36.876 --> 03:02:43.480]  I think one solution would be for these situations, especially when people are calling into question excessive use of force.
[03:02:43.760 --> 03:02:43.940]  I think
[03:03:03.547 --> 03:03:04.927]  This is a national problem.
[03:03:04.947 --> 03:03:06.568]  This is happening all over the country.
[03:03:06.888 --> 03:03:11.629]  These rules of engagement, this militarization of the police that's being driven out of Washington.
[03:03:11.649 --> 03:03:13.649]  Thank you so much, George, in Connecticut.
[03:03:13.669 --> 03:03:15.029]  Let's go to Dave in New York.
[03:03:15.089 --> 03:03:15.310]  Dave?
[03:03:16.550 --> 03:03:17.350]  Hey guys, how you doing?
[03:03:17.430 --> 03:03:18.050]  Doing a great job.
[03:03:19.090 --> 03:03:19.370]  Thank you.
[03:03:19.410 --> 03:03:19.650]  Go ahead.
[03:03:19.670 --> 03:03:20.171]  What's your question?
[03:03:22.571 --> 03:03:26.632]  I want to comment on the difficulty of cooperating.
[03:03:27.512 --> 03:03:30.033]  And I want to tell you a story, and I hope you can put it on your website.
[03:03:30.093 --> 03:03:30.993]  It would help us.
[03:03:32.054 --> 03:03:34.614]  We're fighting a case where a gentleman was charged with murder.
[03:03:36.135 --> 03:03:40.315]  What led up to the charges is he found out he had a fugitive living next door.
[03:03:41.816 --> 03:03:48.557]  And when he helped the guy, eventually the guy told him that he was, uh, confessed he was wanted for rape.
[03:03:49.617 --> 03:03:55.338]  My guy went to the police, he made arrangements with the police to deliver this guy to the police.
[03:03:55.978 --> 03:04:00.179]  So, he takes him down the road, they pull the guy over for speeding,
[03:04:01.067 --> 03:04:16.138]  Reprimand my guy who's speeding and pull the fell out of the car gently and courteously and ask him who he is and then without even cuffing him or checking to see if there is a warrant they take him back to the shack where he stays.
[03:04:17.059 --> 03:04:20.722]  Where he promptly bolts having no cuffs on him.
[03:04:22.123 --> 03:04:29.328]  They assure my guy no big deal but next day they amount an enormous manhunt.
[03:04:29.844 --> 03:04:31.184]  Which my guy, again, assists.
[03:04:32.025 --> 03:04:33.745]  Telling them the lay of the land.
[03:04:34.545 --> 03:04:35.886]  They surround the wrong building.
[03:04:35.906 --> 03:04:41.668]  They flush this guy into a reservoir where he's swimming at, what, half a mile an hour?
[03:04:41.688 --> 03:04:42.548]  Uh-huh.
[03:04:42.568 --> 03:04:51.131]  They ride to the opposite side of the reservoir with SWAT, dogs, helicopter, boat, and they miss the guy.
[03:04:51.791 --> 03:04:52.731]  Somehow they lose him.
[03:04:53.632 --> 03:04:56.112]  But, do you think this guy, we're almost at it, we've got ten seconds.
[03:04:56.152 --> 03:04:58.093]  Was this guy involved with him, you think?
[03:05:00.490 --> 03:05:01.170]  No, he was not.
[03:05:01.250 --> 03:05:05.672]  But when he showed up the next day, my guy shot him after trying to arrest him when he lunched at him.
[03:05:06.392 --> 03:05:06.492]  Oh.
[03:05:06.792 --> 03:05:08.152]  Well, that's all the time we've got tonight.
[03:05:08.232 --> 03:05:08.872]  Nightly News.
[03:05:09.012 --> 03:05:10.173]  Hang on, we'll get your phone number.
[03:05:10.193 --> 03:05:11.413]  7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:05:11.473 --> 03:05:11.653]  Eastern.
