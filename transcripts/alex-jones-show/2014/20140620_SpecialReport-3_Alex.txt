[00:00:06.977 --> 00:00:09.077]  This is Jakari Jackson for InfoWars.com.
[00:00:09.097 --> 00:00:16.439]  We're on the Texas-Mexico border investigating what could be considered an invasion of the United States of America by Central American immigrants.
[00:00:16.719 --> 00:00:19.199]  You say, well, maybe invasion is too strong of a word.
[00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:22.600]  Well, let's take a look at some of these words from the Border Patrol agents themselves.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.821]  We have this article, Ex-Border Patrol Agents, Immigrant Flood Orchestrated.
[00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:34.802]  And in this article, these Border Patrol agents, they're talking about how this is a very intentional thing done by the Obama administration, preying on the
[00:00:35.282 --> 00:00:42.490]  Well, meaning good wishes of the American people, because you have church groups and other people that pick up these people at the bus stations.
[00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:43.811]  They give them a hot bath.
[00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:47.715]  They give them a hot meal, then loose them back onto the streets of America.
[00:00:48.136 --> 00:00:52.601]  But you have to consider that many of the people that are coming here, this has been reported in Breitbart,
[00:00:53.081 --> 00:01:01.570]  And the thing that concerns me about this is because we see border patrol agents and they're concerned about what we're doing as journalists, not concerned so much about what the illegal immigrants are doing.
[00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.051]  And I'm saying to these guys,
[00:01:17.105 --> 00:01:21.308]  You know, if you really want to catch these illegal immigrants, why are you out here worrying about what we're doing?
[00:01:21.568 --> 00:01:26.091]  Why don't you go to some of these army bases, some of these other facilities that are housing these people illegally?
[00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:35.057]  We see, for example, back in 2009, a California county spent $64 million providing welfare assistance to these illegal immigrants.
[00:01:35.337 --> 00:01:40.260]  So, this is very much a financial concern, not just the safety risk of gangs or the health risk.
[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.020]  We're good to go.
[00:02:02.574 --> 00:02:06.035]  When we can't even fulfill the needs of the people right here in our own country.
[00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:12.878]  So stay tuned to InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.TV for more reports and we'll be bringing you more from the border here in South Texas.
[00:02:13.178 --> 00:02:18.800]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.203]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:02:26.363 --> 00:02:29.564]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:02:29.724 --> 00:02:31.526]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:36.330]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:39.173]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:45.119]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:48.740]  It's made right here in the USA completely non-GMO.
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:57.242]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:02:57.422 --> 00:03:03.284]  Nascent iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[00:03:03.404 --> 00:03:05.384]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.
