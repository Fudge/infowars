[00:00:02.876 --> 00:00:03.196]  U.S.
[00:00:03.276 --> 00:00:04.697]  gum sales are down.
[00:00:05.037 --> 00:00:11.421]  Now, there are many theories as to what causes this, but the Associated Press reports an 11% drop in the past four years.
[00:00:11.742 --> 00:00:16.905]  The commenters on the article are convinced, at least in part, that the decrease in sales is due to aspartame.
[00:00:17.425 --> 00:00:22.989]  Aspartame, the artificial sweetener made from the bacteria poop of genetically modified organisms.
[00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:24.650]  I am not making this up.
[00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.271]  Let's take a look at some of these comments.
[00:00:27.211 --> 00:00:29.472]  Aspartame in most all gum is poisonous.
[00:00:29.932 --> 00:00:32.912]  Other similar sweeteners with different names are just as poisonous.
[00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:36.733]  How about we try using cane sugar for gum, like back in the 70s?
[00:00:37.194 --> 00:00:40.894]  Aspartame and other artificial sweeteners slash ingredients are the problem.
[00:00:41.395 --> 00:00:43.395]  The decline is related to aspartame.
[00:00:43.875 --> 00:00:45.776]  It's very difficult to find gum without it.
[00:00:46.076 --> 00:00:47.516]  And it goes on from there.
[00:00:47.916 --> 00:00:54.718]  Back in 2010, InfoWars interviewed Dr. Russell Blaylock on a myriad of topics, but here's what he had to say about aspartame.
[00:00:55.208 --> 00:01:06.095]  If we start looking at some of the other things that are being done in this society, for instance, the use of aspartame, widespread use of aspartame, which is also proven to be a brain toxin, without any question.
[00:01:06.736 --> 00:01:10.058]  It's also linked to an increased incidence of cancer.
[00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:14.561]  To any reasonable objective of mine, these studies prove it.
[00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:21.605]  And so when they were doing the first approval of aspartame, when it was made by G.D.
[00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:22.346]  Serrell Company,
[00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:23.795]  They told G.D.
[00:01:23.835 --> 00:01:28.998]  Searle, do some experiments and present them to the FDA and we'll see about approval.
[00:01:29.758 --> 00:01:34.941]  Well, they did the experiments and studies on mice and they presented it to G.D.
[00:01:35.021 --> 00:01:48.027]  Searle and a board of scientists, which included neuroscientists, said, well, we don't think this should be approved because there's a very high incidence of brain tumors.
[00:01:48.527 --> 00:01:50.808]  And just as a note, the pitchman for G.D.
[00:01:50.848 --> 00:01:56.811]  Searle at the time of Aspartame's approval was Donald Rumsfeld, who went on to become our former Defense Secretary.

[00:02:30.642 --> 00:02:35.307]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
