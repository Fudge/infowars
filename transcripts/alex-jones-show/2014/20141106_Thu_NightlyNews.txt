[00:00:19.673 --> 00:00:21.713]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:22.794]  I'm Darren McBreen.
[00:00:22.874 --> 00:00:25.234]  It is Thursday, November 6th, 2014.
[00:00:25.514 --> 00:00:27.834]  Here's a quick look at what's coming up.
[00:00:30.175 --> 00:00:38.736]  Tonight, as Monsanto pushes dirty tricks against GMO labeling, activists are waking across the nation.
[00:00:39.596 --> 00:00:44.277]  And a Hollywood insider speaks out against false flag terror.
[00:00:44.857 --> 00:00:48.518]  That's next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:57.670]  And I am sick of being nice guy and putting up with all this bull while a bunch of criminals run all over us and walk all over us.
[00:00:58.968 --> 00:01:07.550]  Well, in the aftermath of the midterm elections, we were all very disappointed to find out that the two GMO labeling propositions were defeated.
[00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.291]  One of them was in Oregon, the other was in Colorado.
[00:01:10.331 --> 00:01:19.933]  And this is very strange, because we know from all major publications that the American public overwhelmingly supports GMO labeling.
[00:01:20.293 --> 00:01:24.796]  Yet, when it comes to these propositions, they always end up voting it down for some reason.
[00:01:25.097 --> 00:01:31.841]  Just like they did in the midterms, and like they did in Washington State, and in California, just a couple years ago.
[00:01:32.442 --> 00:01:35.684]  And Anthony Gucciardi joins us now to help make sense of all this.
[00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:36.865]  What the hell is going on?
[00:01:37.225 --> 00:01:42.629]  The majority of Americans, they want GMO labeling, yet these propositions are failing.
[00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:43.190]  What's going on?
[00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.251]  Well, you know, everyone's asking, what is going on?
[00:01:45.311 --> 00:01:49.194]  Because they're going out, they're saying, we support GMO labeling, everyone we talk to supports it.
[00:01:49.554 --> 00:01:57.099]  We're going to get into some polls that show over 96 plus percent of the United States public in these major, major polls support GMO labeling.
[00:01:57.419 --> 00:02:01.301]  But then specifically, we're going to talk about why these elections are failing.
[00:02:01.662 --> 00:02:05.504]  Why every single time GMO labeling is being pushed in states, it's being shot down.
[00:02:05.884 --> 00:02:07.685]  It comes down to some key dirty tricks.
[00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:14.329]  It even comes down to Monsanto literally impersonating the FDA, Stanford, some other organizations.
[00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.271]  And this is not conspiracy theory.
[00:02:16.311 --> 00:02:18.432]  This is the Huffington Post is now agreeing with us.
[00:02:18.792 --> 00:02:21.194]  I mean, we're at the final frontier on the battle for GMO.
[00:02:21.514 --> 00:02:30.380]  But let's specifically talk about, this is from the article that was just up yesterday, how Monsanto keeps halting GMO labeling despite over 96 plus percent approval.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.482]  And I wrote this after I got home at about 12 a.m.
[00:02:34.163 --> 00:02:37.605]  due to the extended coverage here that we were doing of the elections.
[00:02:37.745 --> 00:02:43.669]  And I had to write it because I just was so flabbergasted with all the emails saying, why is GMO labeling not succeeding?
[00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:44.490]  Well, let's talk about it.
[00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.075]  The New York Times found that 93 plus percent were in support of GMO labeling.
[00:02:50.515 --> 00:02:52.236]  MSNBC, 96 percent.
[00:02:52.537 --> 00:02:54.198]  Reuters, NPR, 93 percent.
[00:02:54.258 --> 00:02:55.980]  Washington Post, 95 percent.
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.861]  Consumer Reports, 95 percent.
[00:02:57.981 --> 00:02:59.343]  ABC News, 93 percent.
[00:02:59.883 --> 00:03:02.245]  These are not website polls which show the same thing.
[00:03:02.665 --> 00:03:04.647]  These are real, serious polling agencies.
[00:03:04.927 --> 00:03:05.628]  Every single time.
[00:03:05.668 --> 00:03:06.048]  So you say,
[00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:08.870]  If that's true, then what's going on?
[00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:09.690]  Something's happening.
[00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:16.513]  There's a disconnect between the intellectual result of saying, I'm going to support GMO labeling, and when they actually push the ballot.
[00:03:16.793 --> 00:03:17.314]  So what is it?
[00:03:17.534 --> 00:03:27.158]  It comes down to a dirty, dirty, dirty trick, primarily, where Monsanto is pretending, through paying PR firms, we're going to get into the actual research, to say that it's going to cost you more.
[00:03:27.178 --> 00:03:28.139]  Because you've heard that, haven't you?
[00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:30.620]  No, these are the scare tactics that you see.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.264]  People in Colorado and Oregon, they were absolutely bombarded by these political ads.
[00:03:36.324 --> 00:03:41.368]  And most of the time, it was straight out of like an Edward Bernays, who's the father of propaganda.
[00:03:41.408 --> 00:03:44.210]  I mean, it looked like it was scripted by Edward Bernays, you know.
[00:03:44.631 --> 00:03:49.595]  This is a guy that's wearing a cowboy hat who says he's for family farms.
[00:03:50.075 --> 00:03:56.800]  And he is scaring people into believing, hey man, if you vote yes on this, your grocery bills are going to skyrocket.
[00:03:57.181 --> 00:03:58.622]  I have a consumer's report.
[00:03:59.002 --> 00:04:03.367]  That says that it only annually cost the families $2.30.
[00:04:04.227 --> 00:04:07.491]  That's not $2.30 every time you go to the grocery store.
[00:04:07.531 --> 00:04:09.573]  That's $2.30 a year.
[00:04:09.993 --> 00:04:13.817]  And I think that's a small price to pay to know what's actually in your food.
[00:04:13.897 --> 00:04:18.262]  So these are scare tactics and unfortunately a lot of people fell for it.
[00:04:18.462 --> 00:04:25.386]  Well, the funny thing is, if we actually look at the source, people say, you know, where are they getting the information that it's going to cost me that much more at the grocery store?
[00:04:25.426 --> 00:04:27.367]  What's the source, the intel?
[00:04:27.907 --> 00:04:35.832]  And I actually found, through research, and now Huffington Post is confirming this, it's linked up in the same article, where it shows how they misused an FDA quote, which we can talk about.
[00:04:36.252 --> 00:04:54.960]  But specifically, this is from the Huffington Post, Monsanto paid a PR firm with expertise in fighting recycling legislation, so they worked on behalf of the soda pop industry, to generate a misleading quote-unquote study that was designed to show the proposition raising food prices by hundreds of dollars per state resident per year.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.841]  So it wasn't even real.
[00:04:57.541 --> 00:04:59.802]  And this is not the worst they're getting away with though.
[00:05:00.122 --> 00:05:02.043]  They made an FDA quote up.
[00:05:02.563 --> 00:05:04.185]  The quote said that, quote, the U.S.
[00:05:04.225 --> 00:05:12.732]  Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, says a labeling policy like Prop 37, which was California's initiative to label GMOs, would be, quote-unquote, inherently misleading.
[00:05:13.232 --> 00:05:19.378]  And the FDA went on record and said that they never said that, and they don't actually support things like this.
[00:05:19.838 --> 00:05:21.018]  So what does Monsanto do?
[00:05:21.258 --> 00:05:22.258]  Well, they say that's fine.
[00:05:22.579 --> 00:05:24.099]  They said Stanford supports us.
[00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:31.660]  They used it in TV ads and they mailed out things with Stanford logos on the ads saying, we support Monsanto, GML labeling is unnecessary.
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.661]  As it turns out, Stanford denied actually ever supporting them and said it was completely fake as well.
[00:05:37.841 --> 00:05:43.482]  So this company is doing things that the average person can lead to a $250,000 fine, 20 years in prison, three years supervised release.
[00:05:46.323 --> 00:05:50.109]  And even worse, and they're doing this over and over again to literally deceive people.
[00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:58.443]  That is why there's a disconnect between 96 plus percent support of GMO labeling and actual polling results, because Monsanto is lying to them.
[00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:00.426]  They are a corrupt, evil corporation.
[00:06:01.073 --> 00:06:07.618]  Unbelievable, and you know they were spending millions and millions of dollars on these political ads, and we're actually going to take a look at one right now.
[00:06:07.918 --> 00:06:12.221]  This was your typical ad that was run in Colorado.
[00:06:12.621 --> 00:06:14.582]  It was no on Proposition 105.
[00:06:14.802 --> 00:06:16.183]  Let's take a look.
[00:06:17.464 --> 00:06:20.068]  Agriculture is crucial to Colorado's economy.
[00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:28.359]  Proposition 105 would hurt Colorado food producers by forcing them to use misleading labels that conflict with national standards.
[00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:31.403]  Please stand with Colorado's farmers and vote no on 105.
[00:06:32.785 --> 00:06:33.525]  There you go, folks.
[00:06:33.645 --> 00:06:36.086]  That was the best lies money can buy.
[00:06:36.406 --> 00:06:43.629]  And you notice at the end of these ads, they never say, sponsored by Monsanto Corporation, the creators of Agent Orange.
[00:06:43.869 --> 00:06:46.930]  Because everybody, nobody trusts Monsanto, you know?
[00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:54.212]  And if they knew it was sponsored by Monsanto, they would probably recognize it for the BS that it really is.
[00:06:54.292 --> 00:06:58.856]  Well of course, Monsanto sets up these groups and we'll actually talk about the key players in all these groups.
[00:06:59.176 --> 00:07:07.564]  They pump millions into them to oppose GMO labeling on their behalf, but then they don't have to say it was paid for by Monsanto because Monsanto has these front groups.
[00:07:08.025 --> 00:07:14.791]  So specifically, when we're looking at things like Prop 37, let's look at the money that's going into this just to defeat your ability
[00:07:15.071 --> 00:07:15.291]  I think so.
[00:07:36.724 --> 00:07:41.268]  Loving PepsiCo, paying $2.1 million to make sure you don't know that you're buying GMOs.
[00:07:41.648 --> 00:07:42.749]  Bayer, $2 million.
[00:07:42.929 --> 00:07:43.910]  Dow, $2 million.
[00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.511]  Syngenta, $2 million.
[00:07:45.571 --> 00:07:46.792]  BASF, $2 million.
[00:07:46.912 --> 00:07:48.934]  Kraft Foods, they care about you so much.
[00:07:49.254 --> 00:07:53.598]  They want to make sure your children eat GMOs and their macaroni and cheese every single night and they don't know about it.
[00:07:53.938 --> 00:07:57.961]  Coca-Cola, they want to use aborted fetuses and GMOs, $1.4 million.
[00:07:58.381 --> 00:08:04.947]  Nestle, General Mills, and just to bring up something in the middle of this that is kind of inspirational.
[00:08:05.427 --> 00:08:11.251]  Let's talk about Kellogg's for a second, who donated $790,000 to make sure you don't know that there are GMOs in their cereal.
[00:08:11.711 --> 00:08:20.857]  Well, as it turns out, Consumer Reports decided that you should know, and they did a test and they found that 100% of their corn in their leading cereals were GMO, Roundup Ready GMOs.
[00:08:21.298 --> 00:08:23.439]  There's already now strikes against Kellogg's.
[00:08:23.479 --> 00:08:24.440]  There's already boycotts.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.822]  There's hundreds of thousands of shares on Facebook about this fact.
[00:08:28.142 --> 00:08:33.346]  There are people going out to grocery stores labeling with massive GMO stickers on the Kellogg's products.
[00:08:33.606 --> 00:08:34.987]  So people are freaking out about this.
[00:08:35.427 --> 00:08:38.672]  It ultimately is coming down to people labeling it themselves and making their own decisions.
[00:08:39.092 --> 00:08:42.717]  But look at this group of people that want you not even to be aware.
[00:08:42.737 --> 00:08:44.440]  And we're not even talking about banning GMOs.
[00:08:45.041 --> 00:08:49.847]  We're talking about millions of dollars to make sure you have no idea what you're putting in your mouth and your children's mouth.
[00:08:49.887 --> 00:08:50.869]  And then, like you said,
[00:08:51.249 --> 00:09:01.896]  I want to hear what you were telling me about this farmer going up and saying, ladies and gentlemen, I'm a homegrown farmer and I think GMOs are perfectly safe despite over 13 studies linking them to every single type of cancer and Roundup is great.
[00:09:01.956 --> 00:09:04.397]  It pollutes the water supply, makes you infertile, and kills your children.
[00:09:04.938 --> 00:09:07.379]  I mean, they don't know the intel.
[00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:07.920]  That's the problem.
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.040]  They don't know the information.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:09.921]  That's why we're here.
[00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:11.542]  Well, and here's the thing.
[00:09:11.622 --> 00:09:12.903]  When it comes down to it,
[00:09:14.668 --> 00:09:20.492]  These propositions, it wasn't a judgment on whether or not GMO food is bad for you or not, so to say.
[00:09:21.293 --> 00:09:31.960]  So if you're someone, for example, who perhaps you're not concerned that it's a health hazard, well, this was not a judgment on whether or not GMO food is bad or if it's good.
[00:09:32.301 --> 00:09:34.342]  This was simply about labeling it.
[00:09:34.402 --> 00:09:36.764]  This was so a consumer that we could go in
[00:09:37.364 --> 00:09:42.512]  Read the ingredients and see if there's any GMO based products on there and decide for ourselves.
[00:09:42.572 --> 00:09:43.573]  We have a right to know.
[00:09:43.633 --> 00:09:44.815]  That's what this whole thing was about.
[00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:49.001]  Well, it's just like if you want to know the carbohydrates in your food or if you want to know is there sugar in this food.
[00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:49.442]  Exactly.
[00:09:49.602 --> 00:09:51.405]  Is there a large amount of fat in this food?
[00:09:51.725 --> 00:09:52.286]  Well, are there...
[00:09:52.987 --> 00:09:53.467]  We're good.
[00:10:11.434 --> 00:10:12.995]  Election rigging at this point, also.
[00:10:13.015 --> 00:10:19.437]  We're not even getting into voter fraud, which is also another huge thing that you can bet Monsanto's got their hand in.
[00:10:19.537 --> 00:10:28.500]  This is just deception at a base level, making consumers think that, yeah, you know, I do want to label GMOs, but I also don't want to pay hundreds of dollars more on my grocery bill, which is a total lie.
[00:10:30.014 --> 00:10:39.101]  Well, I thought what was disturbing, okay, naturally the TV heads, they're going to get bought and sold on these commercials, but they also targeted the newspapers.
[00:10:39.402 --> 00:10:41.203]  And these are the corporate-owned newspapers.
[00:10:41.543 --> 00:10:47.628]  But what they're targeting here is the smarter person who's going to look into it.
[00:10:47.708 --> 00:10:50.871]  So this is basically someone who's doing the research.
[00:10:51.431 --> 00:10:55.934]  And they trust their local newspapers, so naturally that's where they're going to go and try to figure it out.
[00:10:56.194 --> 00:10:58.775]  And some of these newspaper articles are horrific.
[00:10:58.855 --> 00:11:06.440]  I found one the other day published by The Atlantic, and where of course they're basically calling you a conspiracy theorist if you want GMO labeling.
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.221]  This is what it says in The Atlantic.
[00:11:08.361 --> 00:11:14.684]  No widely accepted science supports the idea that GMOs are inherently dangerous to people's health.
[00:11:15.324 --> 00:11:19.147]  Opposition to GMOs is nothing more than a dangerous mania.
[00:11:19.927 --> 00:11:29.696]  And the people in the grip of it are akin to those who refuse to vaccinate their children or who deny that human activity is changing the Earth's climate.
[00:11:29.936 --> 00:11:33.480]  It goes on to say that the paranoia is driven by internet rumors.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.802]  Basically, they're saying you're stupid.
[00:11:36.002 --> 00:11:40.326]  And by the way, I found out one of the underwriters for the Atlantic, Monsanto Corporation.
[00:11:40.566 --> 00:11:41.006]  Well, of course.
[00:11:41.047 --> 00:11:41.787]  But here's how it works.
[00:11:41.807 --> 00:11:42.928]  There's two levels to this.
[00:11:43.048 --> 00:11:49.654]  There is, of course, the kind of Midwestern individual that just watches television, doesn't really know what's going on, but supports farmland.
[00:11:49.874 --> 00:11:54.619]  And then Monsanto has their propaganda commercials like that guy, just saying, hey, you know, we're great.
[00:11:54.679 --> 00:11:55.419]  GMOs are great.
[00:11:55.459 --> 00:11:56.140]  They make us money.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.242]  You don't want to pay more money to have labeling, do you?
[00:11:58.282 --> 00:11:58.782]  And that works.
[00:11:59.363 --> 00:12:07.549]  But then the second tier is they know they're intellectual individuals like everyone watching right now that are going to go on Google and they're going to Google RGMO food safe.
[00:12:07.949 --> 00:12:14.174]  So they target the search engine optimization, they pay writers, and they have this kind of pseudo-intellectual weird fake
[00:12:14.654 --> 00:12:15.074]  We're good.
[00:12:30.525 --> 00:12:34.546]  There is no actual evidence that fluoride is harming your brain and harming children.
[00:12:34.747 --> 00:12:40.629]  But then the federal government research journals admit that it's actually neurotoxic and damaging children's brains.
[00:12:40.649 --> 00:12:44.910]  And then the next day, within that same week, the government says, yes, we do need to reduce levels.
[00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:47.411]  Yeah, it reminds me of the tobacco corporations.
[00:12:47.591 --> 00:12:51.456]  You know, back in the day they used to say there was no link between cigarette smoking and cancer.
[00:12:51.476 --> 00:12:52.317]  So you know who did that, right?
[00:12:52.337 --> 00:12:53.038]  And here we go, who's that?
[00:12:53.058 --> 00:12:57.164]  His name was, we're getting into a whole bunch of subjects, but his name was, I think, Ingram Oken.
[00:12:57.725 --> 00:13:01.309]  And he worked for Stanford, which Monsanto's buddy-buddy with, they have a whole wing there.
[00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:05.014]  And he did the, he's called the father of statistical lies.
[00:13:05.635 --> 00:13:07.517]  This came out a couple years ago, we did an article about it.
[00:13:08.137 --> 00:13:15.243]  And he made up the theory that tobacco actually helped your heart because all the studies showed it was causing heart damage and everything like that.
[00:13:15.403 --> 00:13:18.045]  Four out of five doctors recommend Camel cigarettes.
[00:13:18.065 --> 00:13:18.705]  Yes, exactly.
[00:13:18.745 --> 00:13:20.967]  Cigarettes with tar and everything, not just straight tobacco, cigarettes.
[00:13:21.307 --> 00:13:24.390]  And he was called the father of statistical lies because he was able to show
[00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:29.394]  On his breakdown, that it was helping your heart, despite all the actual real information.
[00:13:29.694 --> 00:13:35.618]  That's the same guy that's now saying that GMOs are perfectly safe and organic is the same as non-organic.
[00:13:35.959 --> 00:13:39.161]  And that was the big story a couple years ago, that there's no reason to buy organic.
[00:13:39.501 --> 00:13:40.522]  It's the same as conventional.
[00:13:40.542 --> 00:13:41.703]  It has no nutritional support.
[00:13:41.763 --> 00:13:47.107]  So he has a proven track record from the tobacco industry, and now he's working against GMO labeling.
[00:13:48.368 --> 00:13:48.728]  Exactly.
[00:13:48.768 --> 00:13:54.451]  Those are the type of people that go on and they say, you're unscientific if you don't support GMO labeling.
[00:13:54.471 --> 00:14:02.014]  So I guess we're unscientific here with the actual stats, the actual data, looking how Monsanto fakes FDA quotes, Stanford quotes, pays off people.
[00:14:02.054 --> 00:14:05.075]  The father of statistical lies is on their side, though, so you just better bow down.
[00:14:05.575 --> 00:14:06.516]  Well, let's talk about this.
[00:14:06.576 --> 00:14:13.459]  There is a massive revolving door when it comes to Monsanto executives and positions in the federal government.
[00:14:14.139 --> 00:14:29.233]  We're talking about Monsanto executives, CEOs, scientists, I call them mad scientists, but they have been placed in all sorts of federal positions that include the Department of Justice, the FDA Commissioner, the Advisor to the Department of Energy, U.S.
[00:14:29.273 --> 00:14:30.434]  Secretary of Commerce.
[00:14:30.734 --> 00:14:39.142]  Director of the USDA, the Chief Administrator of the EPA, once there was an acting Director of the FBI, Deputy U.S.
[00:14:39.202 --> 00:14:40.363]  Attorney General, U.S.
[00:14:40.403 --> 00:14:41.204]  Senators, U.S.
[00:14:41.264 --> 00:14:46.409]  Congressmen, Donald Rumsfeld, as you know, he was the CEO for Searle, who ended up
[00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:56.797]  Merging with Monsanto, and he successfully had Aspartame legalized, and then he was appointed the Secretary of Defense.
[00:14:57.077 --> 00:15:02.521]  So I mean, there is a massive revolving door, and it's so obvious, it's blatant, it's right in your face.
[00:15:02.581 --> 00:15:03.882]  It's a conflict of interest.
[00:15:03.922 --> 00:15:04.443]  No, exactly.
[00:15:04.463 --> 00:15:05.023]  And I want to get into that.
[00:15:05.043 --> 00:15:07.005]  Just to break into the aspartame thing, this is a key thing.
[00:15:07.025 --> 00:15:08.727]  We're actually going to rewrite this because no one knows this.
[00:15:08.907 --> 00:15:10.088]  You know what aspartame is made?
[00:15:10.488 --> 00:15:12.750]  Genetically modified bacteria waste.
[00:15:13.111 --> 00:15:15.753]  Genetically modified bacteria crap is taken.
[00:15:15.773 --> 00:15:18.316]  This is from a 1998 Independent article, you can Google it.
[00:15:18.556 --> 00:15:25.903]  They had a Monsanto rep and he was like, yeah, we take the genetically modified bacteria crap and then we put it into a petri dish and let it grow and then
[00:15:26.363 --> 00:15:29.205]  We wait for the crap to ferment and then we have aspartame.
[00:15:29.245 --> 00:15:32.167]  And it's like, is there any debate anymore?
[00:15:32.928 --> 00:15:37.932]  As far as I know, there's over 500 officials in the United States government that worked for or currently work for Monsanto.
[00:15:38.352 --> 00:15:40.073]  It's a total revolving door.
[00:15:40.293 --> 00:15:44.997]  That's how the FDA is now giving them speedy approval processes on all their stuff.
[00:15:45.277 --> 00:15:47.018]  And anyone can go Google this right now too.
[00:15:47.318 --> 00:15:49.420]  Look up Monsanto U.S.E.U.
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:50.120]  trade wars.
[00:15:50.601 --> 00:15:53.123]  So if you remember this, this is from The Guardian.
[00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:59.405]  They said that if you don't support Monsanto, the United States diplomats did, if you don't support Monsanto, that's fine.
[00:15:59.765 --> 00:16:01.446]  We'll just issue trade wars against you.
[00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:08.929]  So the government, and by the way, the State Department, pays for pamphlets and information for Monsanto to be distributed throughout the world.
[00:16:09.609 --> 00:16:11.970]  Specifically Spain, and that's who was trying to reject them.
[00:16:12.271 --> 00:16:13.811]  And they were saying, that's okay, Spanish government.
[00:16:14.131 --> 00:16:18.293]  If you reject Monsanto and biotech, we will issue trade wars against you and economically collapse you.
[00:16:18.653 --> 00:16:20.134]  So that's how in bed they are.
[00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:22.456]  They're pushing it on an agenda.
[00:16:22.757 --> 00:16:24.818]  And that's why everywhere else is labeling GMOs.
[00:16:25.319 --> 00:16:29.502]  That's why everywhere else is actually standing up for your rights and some capacity to not eat GMOs.
[00:16:29.743 --> 00:16:34.326]  But here, we're in the cesspit of GMO roundup junk.
[00:16:34.647 --> 00:16:37.229]  Just shoveling it down our throats and we're not allowed to know we're eating it.
[00:16:38.427 --> 00:16:39.308]  There's something wrong with that.
[00:16:40.548 --> 00:16:42.330]  They want to control the world's food supply.
[00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:43.951]  That's their endgame.
[00:16:44.631 --> 00:16:58.360]  I had a chance to talk with former federal crimes investigator, best-selling author, and investigative journalist Greg Palast the other day, and here's what he had to say about Monsanto's powerful reach into Washington.
[00:16:58.789 --> 00:17:00.651]  I mean, Monsanto is very smart.
[00:17:01.071 --> 00:17:06.137]  A really smart corporation understands you don't favor one party over another.
[00:17:06.177 --> 00:17:08.499]  You don't put your bet on one horse.
[00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:12.684]  You buy the racetrack, you fix the house, okay?
[00:17:14.145 --> 00:17:14.565]  I don't
[00:17:32.637 --> 00:17:39.619]  I mean, the Bush administration had their hand in these games with Monsanto, but nothing close to what the Clintons did.
[00:17:39.659 --> 00:17:54.242]  And I think that a lot of Democrats who are sitting there eating beansprouts sandwiches and making sure their kids have, you know, that they buy things that are organic and they go to Whole Foods, they pay triple.
[00:17:54.762 --> 00:18:11.692]  I think that they would be shocked to find out that, in fact, a lot of those products that they think are wonderful and organic and free of any manipulation are, in fact, Frankenstein foods that are not properly labeled, care of the Clintons.
[00:18:12.452 --> 00:18:12.953]  That's right.
[00:18:13.273 --> 00:18:13.913]  Big problem.
[00:18:13.953 --> 00:18:18.476]  I mean, you know, this is the problem of pretend partisanship.
[00:18:19.366 --> 00:18:23.110]  They own both parties, and that's what I guess a party is for.
[00:18:23.431 --> 00:18:23.871]  There you go.
[00:18:23.911 --> 00:18:30.038]  Greg Palast is saying that Monsanto has the Democrats in their left pocket, Republicans are in the right.
[00:18:30.118 --> 00:18:30.919]  Same old story.
[00:18:30.939 --> 00:18:32.081]  Anything you want to add to that?
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.341]  You know I think overall we are winning the war against GMOs.
[00:18:35.461 --> 00:18:37.462]  We are pushing towards GMO labeling.
[00:18:37.982 --> 00:18:42.825]  And pretty much I know everyone watching this video is in full agreement with us and in full agreement with reality.
[00:18:43.345 --> 00:18:49.608]  And the good news is I see on a daily basis with thousands of emails and hundreds of thousands of shares on all social media platforms.
[00:18:50.328 --> 00:18:52.669]  We are fed up with Monsanto, and it's time for them to go.
[00:18:52.689 --> 00:18:55.410]  They're losing tens of millions of dollars just last quarter.
[00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:56.771]  They were flushing out money.
[00:18:57.291 --> 00:18:59.152]  No one wants their garbage products anymore.
[00:18:59.252 --> 00:19:02.954]  And you can vote yourself by going to the grocery store and saying, hey, I'm not going to buy this.
[00:19:03.234 --> 00:19:05.595]  I'm only going to buy non-GMO Project Verified.
[00:19:05.955 --> 00:19:07.616]  And ultimately, we will win the war.
[00:19:07.716 --> 00:19:08.457]  There's no question.
[00:19:08.477 --> 00:19:08.837]  That's right.
[00:19:09.417 --> 00:19:10.979]  Well, Anthony Gucciardi, thanks for hanging out.
[00:19:10.999 --> 00:19:12.001]  It was good to have you.
[00:19:12.461 --> 00:19:19.271]  And be sure to check out Anthony's latest article, How Monsanto Keeps Halting GMO Labeling Despite Over 96% Approval Rating.
[00:19:21.789 --> 00:19:28.714]  That's right, and you know, like all of you, I was very disappointed when I found out that these GMO labeling propositions failed.
[00:19:29.374 --> 00:19:33.517]  I can't say I was too surprised, but I was very disappointed.
[00:19:33.817 --> 00:19:40.742]  But the good news is that GMO awareness is actually growing as a result of these campaigns.
[00:19:41.062 --> 00:19:48.867]  And as you're about to find out, there has been some major victories against Monsatan, I mean Monsanto, at the local level.
[00:19:50.299 --> 00:19:55.605]  People deserve to know whether the food we're feeding our families has been genetically engineered for heavy pesticides.
[00:19:55.845 --> 00:19:58.368]  GMO issues were on the ballot in multiple states in 2014.
[00:19:58.768 --> 00:20:02.332]  And by genetic modification, I don't mean creating hybrids.
[00:20:02.692 --> 00:20:04.494]  That's been done throughout human history.
[00:20:05.115 --> 00:20:08.579]  I'm talking about transgenic genetic modification.
[00:20:09.159 --> 00:20:21.581]  Directly manipulating and combining the genes of dissimilar organisms or even mixing the genes of plants and animals to create new chimera, new Frankenstein creations.
[00:20:22.101 --> 00:20:35.403]  Bills to let people know if there were genetically modified organisms in their food by requiring GMO labeling were defeated in Colorado 66 to 34 percent and narrowly defeated in Oregon 49.3 percent to 50.7 percent.
[00:20:38.524 --> 00:20:45.470]  In Oregon, 100% of the funding to stop labeling of GMO in food was out of state.
[00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:49.574]  100% of the funding to stop GMO labeling was from corporations.
[00:20:50.114 --> 00:20:53.838]  And spending was heavily skewed to keep consumers from knowing what's in their food.
[00:20:54.358 --> 00:20:57.179]  In Colorado, the spread was 12 million to 7 million.
[00:20:57.599 --> 00:21:00.140]  In Oregon this year, it was 20 million to 9 million.
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.801]  A year ago in Washington, it was 22 million to 8 million.
[00:21:03.841 --> 00:21:07.982]  In California in 2012, it was 45 million to 9 million.
[00:21:08.283 --> 00:21:18.386]  Monsanto and Big Agra have spent $100 million in just the last two years in just these four states to stop the public from knowing what's in their food.
[00:21:19.144 --> 00:21:23.135]  As a farmer and a new mom, accurate food labels are important to me.
[00:21:23.696 --> 00:21:25.080]  That's why I'm voting no on 92.
[00:21:26.243 --> 00:21:32.926]  Money spent on propaganda and lies to convince you that GMO is safe and it's too expensive to change a label.
[00:21:33.486 --> 00:21:36.447]  If GMO is so great, then why wouldn't they want you to know?
[00:21:36.887 --> 00:21:39.328]  And why wouldn't they want to feature it on their label?
[00:21:39.809 --> 00:21:41.709]  Look at how effective their propaganda is.
[00:21:42.069 --> 00:21:47.552]  The first poll in Oregon was taken in the summer before the massive propaganda campaign.
[00:21:47.572 --> 00:21:49.492]  77% in favor of labeling and only 12% opposed.
[00:21:51.371 --> 00:21:51.591]  U.S.
[00:21:51.611 --> 00:21:54.212]  food companies already label in 64 countries.
[00:21:54.392 --> 00:21:55.713]  Shouldn't they label here too?
[00:21:56.113 --> 00:21:57.753]  Why can't we have GMO labeling?
[00:21:58.053 --> 00:22:07.357]  We have required labeling of food for many things like artificial flavors and colors, chemical preservatives, fat, oil, the percentages and kinds of fats.
[00:22:08.197 --> 00:22:10.538]  But you can't know if it has GMO.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:15.363]  There are a couple of forms of certifications now, but it can be confusing.
[00:22:15.723 --> 00:22:27.893]  If we look at the difference between USDA organic certification versus the non-GMO project, non-GMO is cheaper than organic, and some have accused it of blurring the line between organic and non-organic.
[00:22:27.933 --> 00:22:31.316]  For example, chicken with the non-GMO project label
[00:22:31.876 --> 00:22:32.616]  Thanks for watching!
[00:22:51.642 --> 00:22:52.523]  Are you confused yet?
[00:22:52.963 --> 00:23:02.371]  Wouldn't it be better if we could just stop the direct manipulation and mixing of the genes of plants and animals in order to create these kind of Frankenstein chimera in the first place?
[00:23:02.711 --> 00:23:06.234]  But that would require banning the practices of Monsanto.
[00:23:06.434 --> 00:23:10.898]  But they have a foothold on the American government and on the political process here.
[00:23:11.038 --> 00:23:13.060]  It would require defeating them on the ballot.
[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:14.141]  Is that impossible?
[00:23:14.887 --> 00:23:15.087]  No.
[00:23:15.868 --> 00:23:22.515]  Although attempts to get GMO labeling at the state and national level has failed, local bans at the county level have been successful.
[00:23:22.956 --> 00:23:26.479]  Before this election, there were already several county bans on growing GMO.
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:36.450]  Two counties in Oregon, one county in Washington, four counties in several cities in California were joined by Humboldt County, California, which also passed a ban on Tuesday.
[00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:37.951]  We're not mega farms here.
[00:23:38.151 --> 00:23:45.236]  Our small family farms and pasture-based dairies have a great advantage in the growing market for organic and non-GMO foods.
[00:23:45.656 --> 00:23:50.859]  I don't want to have to tell you that the food I'm raising for you has been cross-pollinated by GMOs.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:56.183]  You can help our family farms continue to thrive by voting yes on Measure P.
[00:23:59.958 --> 00:24:05.501]  And there was a huge anti-GMO victory in Maui County, Hawaii as part of the 2014 elections.
[00:24:06.041 --> 00:24:13.764]  In spite of Monsanto and Dow spending $8 million, which was a new record for ballot measures in Hawaii, they were defeated.
[00:24:14.405 --> 00:24:16.385]  And by just a thousand votes.
[00:24:17.186 --> 00:24:19.767]  Monsanto outspent the people of Hawaii 87 to 1.
[00:24:19.807 --> 00:24:21.668]  $300 for every vote they got.
[00:24:24.517 --> 00:24:24.857]  We're good to go.
[00:24:40.245 --> 00:24:42.467]  It was a ban on GMO farming.
[00:24:42.988 --> 00:24:43.748]  Big difference.
[00:24:44.289 --> 00:24:45.950]  The citizens part was also a lie.
[00:24:46.271 --> 00:24:50.595]  It was funded solely and exclusively by Monsanto and Dow.
[00:24:51.155 --> 00:24:53.417]  It wasn't a citizens against farming ban.
[00:24:53.978 --> 00:24:57.621]  It was two GMO corporations against a GMO ban.
[00:24:58.222 --> 00:24:58.802]  And they lost.
[00:24:59.724 --> 00:25:02.766]  And there's a lesson there that goes beyond GMO.
[00:25:03.266 --> 00:25:06.709]  Remember, efforts at the national level have fallen on deaf ears.
[00:25:07.209 --> 00:25:09.711]  Multiple state ballot measures have also failed.
[00:25:10.151 --> 00:25:13.473]  Only the Vermont legislature has passed a GMO label law.
[00:25:13.773 --> 00:25:19.677]  But there have been multiple victories at the county level, stopping GMO at the source.
[00:25:20.598 --> 00:25:22.459]  All politics is local.
[00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:29.244]  We can fight corporate and government intrusion into our lives very successfully at the local level.
[00:25:30.104 --> 00:25:38.990]  When pressed about what the GMO corporations against banning GMO farming PAC was doing, their spokesman said, I'm not comfortable describing our campaign activities.
[00:25:39.691 --> 00:25:42.773]  They're also not comfortable describing what they're doing to our food.
[00:25:43.454 --> 00:25:45.235]  For InfoWars Nightly News, I'm David Knight.
[00:25:56.653 --> 00:25:57.454]  Hi, I'm Dr. Group.
[00:25:57.794 --> 00:26:03.958]  Today, I'm proud and excited to announce a new product to the InfoWars Life product line.
[00:26:04.398 --> 00:26:10.383]  Introducing the first proprietary oxygen-based intestinal cleanser, OxyPowder.
[00:26:11.023 --> 00:26:15.947]  Backed by real FDA-approved Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials.
[00:26:16.787 --> 00:26:20.530]  People are suffering from all kinds of digestive issues these days.
[00:26:20.991 --> 00:26:30.279]  All the toxins from the air, the food, the water, everything that you're exposed to on a daily basis, ultimately ends up in the gut or affects the gut.
[00:26:30.519 --> 00:26:33.101]  My main focus was to come up with a remedy for this.
[00:26:33.221 --> 00:26:40.767]  Something that's safe and effective that anyone can take on a regular basis to keep their intestinal lining clean.
[00:26:41.508 --> 00:26:50.374]  You have over 30 feet of intestinal lining that can be compacted, that can be toxic, that can be full of parasites, fungus, bacteria.
[00:26:50.954 --> 00:26:54.136]  What are you doing to keep that clean and flushed out?
[00:26:54.497 --> 00:27:03.923]  My recommendation is to clean your intestines at least two to three times a week to prevent the toxic buildup from going into your bloodstream.
[00:27:04.203 --> 00:27:10.948]  You owe it to yourself to take your health into your own hands and start cleansing your body today with Oxy-Powder.
[00:27:11.508 --> 00:27:15.258]  Secure your Oxy Powder today at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:27:19.807 --> 00:27:23.148]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:27:23.248 --> 00:27:25.489]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:27:25.649 --> 00:27:33.952]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:27:34.252 --> 00:27:49.578]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum
[00:27:49.818 --> 00:27:50.338]  I'm good.
[00:28:29.028 --> 00:28:30.950]  Welcome back to the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:35.514]  I'm Darren McBreen and I am really looking forward to this next guest.
[00:28:36.174 --> 00:28:37.115]  This ought to be interesting.
[00:28:37.336 --> 00:28:38.957]  His name is Nathan Folks.
[00:28:39.077 --> 00:28:45.443]  He is a film producer and a talent manager who started out at Paramount Pictures.
[00:28:45.743 --> 00:28:51.905]  This guy, he's worked with everyone from Woody Harrelson to Leonardo DiCaprio, Dennis Hopper, you name it.
[00:28:52.265 --> 00:28:57.407]  And now he is working with a group called Exposing the Big Three.
[00:28:57.767 --> 00:29:10.652]  And they are planning a class action lawsuit against the federal government to expose what they believe are false flag terror attacks orchestrated by the United States government.
[00:29:11.492 --> 00:29:12.853]  Mr. Folks, thanks for joining us.
[00:29:13.831 --> 00:29:14.552]  Thanks for having me.
[00:29:14.932 --> 00:29:18.094]  Hey, tell us a little bit more about exposing the big three.
[00:29:18.154 --> 00:29:23.138]  Who's involved in this group and what sort of false flag terror attacks do you plan to expose?
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:35.168]  Well, we're just now getting started and developing a case that will bring light to some of these major events that have happened.
[00:29:36.167 --> 00:29:48.092]  Unfortunately, these events have been events that have been faked, have been a hoax, and we feel Jim Fetzer and David Weiss and some others have
[00:29:48.991 --> 00:30:07.127]  Have come to me, and we have decided, as well as Wolfgang Halbig, that we should get together and develop a class action lawsuit against the federal government for these perpetrated events that don't make any sense.
[00:30:07.567 --> 00:30:14.253]  And we all have ample proof that these events that have occurred have been faked.
[00:30:15.441 --> 00:30:22.466]  So you're talking, I would imagine, the big three would be 9-11, Sandy Hook, the Boston bombing.
[00:30:22.946 --> 00:30:24.927]  Are those, is that what you mean by the big three?
[00:30:24.987 --> 00:30:25.608]  Are there more?
[00:30:26.128 --> 00:30:30.451]  Yeah, no, those are the big three that we're exposing.
[00:30:30.471 --> 00:30:33.533]  9-11 Truth Movement has been active for quite some time.
[00:30:34.093 --> 00:30:39.797]  I think Sandy Hook is now, a lot of new evidence is coming to light so we can utilize that.
[00:30:40.598 --> 00:30:44.921]  And the Boston bombing that I had exposed several months back,
[00:30:46.002 --> 00:31:05.784]  Actually back in April of this year, and I know several people that were involved in that because of my current film that I just released, A Prosecution of an American President, and one of the actors and parents in that film was involved in the Boston bombing.
[00:31:07.079 --> 00:31:10.583]  And this is a film starring Vincent Bugliosi, is that correct?
[00:31:10.783 --> 00:31:11.644]  Yes, that's correct.
[00:31:12.025 --> 00:31:15.088]  And is it released yet, or tell us more about that film.
[00:31:15.268 --> 00:31:17.971]  Yeah, the film was just released.
[00:31:18.452 --> 00:31:21.876]  It actually was blacklisted when it came out in theaters in 2012.
[00:31:21.996 --> 00:31:27.542]  We just released it on DVD, and it's starting to get a lot of attention.
[00:31:28.323 --> 00:31:42.936]  And Vincent Bugliosi essentially makes the case to build a murder case against the President of the United States at the time, George W. Bush, for lying to Congress and taking us to war with a sovereign nation.
[00:31:43.537 --> 00:31:47.520]  And all of these facts now are evident and have been proven.
[00:31:48.521 --> 00:31:52.625]  And he builds the case of why he should be responsible for the death of over 5,000 Americans
[00:31:54.713 --> 00:32:00.998]  Wow, now I remember Bugliosi, he was on the Alex Jones Show about a year ago and he was talking about this.
[00:32:01.018 --> 00:32:04.780]  He was talking about releasing this and now you're the gentleman that produced it.
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:19.441]  I am one of the executive producers.
[00:32:19.781 --> 00:32:20.361]  There's several.
[00:32:21.602 --> 00:32:26.944]  But at this point, in fact, it's probably been more than a year ago he was on.
[00:32:27.244 --> 00:32:32.366]  He's been sick for almost two years, one of the reasons why we couldn't promote the film.
[00:32:32.586 --> 00:32:34.547]  I'm sorry to hear that.
[00:32:34.847 --> 00:32:42.430]  But he's back, and he's now ready to do a lot of interviews and to come out and expose this film to the world.
[00:32:43.171 --> 00:32:45.952]  And hopefully people will accept it and see
[00:32:46.832 --> 00:32:48.613]  That it needs to be done.
[00:32:48.633 --> 00:32:52.415]  We need to prosecute him for the damage he's done to this nation.
[00:32:52.775 --> 00:32:54.395]  Well, I'm looking forward to checking it out.
[00:32:54.736 --> 00:32:57.897]  It's called Prosecution of an American President.
[00:32:57.997 --> 00:32:59.198]  Be sure to look for it, folks.
[00:32:59.378 --> 00:33:03.399]  And let's go back to the big three, exposing the big three.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:11.063]  Tell me, like, let's say, you know, the InfoWars audience, we're all sold on the fact that Sandy Hook was probably an inside job.
[00:33:11.103 --> 00:33:12.804]  But let's take Sandy Hook, for example.
[00:33:13.524 --> 00:33:14.425]  Sell me on it.
[00:33:14.965 --> 00:33:16.346]  I'm the average TV head.
[00:33:16.886 --> 00:33:23.510]  What makes you convinced that Sandy Hook, that there was government involvement and that it could very well have been a false flag terror attack?
[00:33:25.271 --> 00:33:36.538]  Well, Sandy Hook, I only have the knowledge from Wolfgang Halbig, who is someone who is a public safety inspector for public schools in the nation.
[00:33:37.278 --> 00:33:39.559]  I think you've had him on your show as well.
[00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:40.160]  Absolutely.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:50.549]  And he came out about his knowledge because he knows certain protocols that are in place from other school shootings.
[00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:55.574]  And these protocols were not followed whatsoever in this shooting.
[00:33:56.575 --> 00:34:01.320]  Not to mention the school itself wasn't even an open working school at the time of the shooting.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:04.222]  So all these facts have come to light now.
[00:34:05.234 --> 00:34:21.305]  And Wolfgang has come out to discuss this, and there's actually an article in Global Research by James Tracy that just came out in exposing the mental health agenda the government passed about a month after the shooting.
[00:34:22.085 --> 00:34:26.989]  And since this article came out and Wolfgang has been exposing it,
[00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:38.999]  He's been followed, he's been run off the road just the other day, and people do not want him to continue exposing the truth about Sandy Hook.
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:50.650]  And it's time that people wake up to what they're doing and how they're getting away with these false flag events and using crisis actors.
[00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:52.952]  I mean, I know what crisis actors are.
[00:34:54.463 --> 00:34:56.564]  I know several of them that were in the Boston bombing.
[00:34:57.844 --> 00:35:16.769]  I didn't know anyone in Sandy Hook, but I know that they use these actors over and over, and it's very obvious when you look at all the facts and all the facts are brought out in front of you that this was a staged event by the U.S.
[00:35:16.789 --> 00:35:17.129]  government.
[00:35:17.904 --> 00:35:23.148]  And Wolfgang Halbig, for example, I mean, he's not just your average Joe off the street.
[00:35:23.208 --> 00:35:26.831]  He was an expert witness during the Columbine tragedy.
[00:35:26.851 --> 00:35:27.912]  Am I right?
[00:35:28.332 --> 00:35:29.173]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:35:29.193 --> 00:35:30.474]  I thought so, yeah.
[00:35:30.674 --> 00:35:32.535]  He is the main person.
[00:35:33.456 --> 00:35:34.697]  We're good to go.
[00:36:02.441 --> 00:36:06.004]  They've done a pretty good job, but he's not going to stand for it.
[00:36:06.865 --> 00:36:18.193]  And that's why we want to expose the big three, starting with 9-11, which we have more than enough evidence, and Sandy Hook and the Boston bombing.
[00:36:18.233 --> 00:36:24.378]  These are events that not only have shaken the public, but have changed the world.
[00:36:24.859 --> 00:36:27.561]  And we cannot allow our government to do this any longer.
[00:36:28.604 --> 00:36:37.799]  I also thought it was interesting to find out that you think that the Ebola outbreak could possibly be a staged event as well.
[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:39.241]  Let's get into that a little bit.
[00:36:39.282 --> 00:36:41.225]  What makes you think Ebola might be staged?
[00:36:43.031 --> 00:37:04.022]  I've grown up with a father at the CDC for the last 30 years, and I've made a documentary on emerging viruses, epidemics, and I have been a part of watching protocols put in place for viruses such as Ebola.
[00:37:05.058 --> 00:37:25.636]  And it's astounding to me to watch this play out and to watch people knowing that Ebola, being a very highly contracted disease, you know, just the other day, someone walking around with a clipboard with no protective gear.
[00:37:26.536 --> 00:37:27.697]  That's not a mistake.
[00:37:29.979 --> 00:37:32.341]  It's because it's part of a scene.
[00:37:32.621 --> 00:37:38.305]  There are certain things they don't have to do because they don't need to protect themselves if it's not a real virus.
[00:37:40.475 --> 00:37:45.516]  You know, it's hard for me to watch it because I see this, you know, right off the bat.
[00:37:45.576 --> 00:37:47.017]  I know the protocols that are in place.
[00:37:47.257 --> 00:37:49.217]  Things that would never happen are happening.
[00:37:50.078 --> 00:37:59.320]  And just an example, the crisis actor Nina Pham, who is this nurse from Dallas, you know, a week later, she's got Ebola.
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.741]  The following week after that, she's cured.
[00:38:02.461 --> 00:38:05.282]  And then she's in the White House hugging President Obama.
[00:38:05.542 --> 00:38:06.442]  Total photo op.
[00:38:07.866 --> 00:38:28.861]  It's so bad that if anyone knows Ebola and knows the protocols, even after the Ebola virus is cleared from the blood, you have to contain a patient for six weeks after that because it could be in other fluids in the body and you would never
[00:38:29.481 --> 00:38:35.506]  And I mean never allow that patient out within more than six weeks after it's cleared the blood.
[00:38:36.147 --> 00:38:43.853]  Now just the mere fact that she would go and hug the president in the White House, we should all be terrified that the entire White House is infected.
[00:38:44.333 --> 00:38:48.557]  But we know that it's not because it's a false flag Ebola outbreak.
[00:38:49.059 --> 00:38:56.361]  Well I think it's very important that the American public understands and are educated on the history of false flag terrorism.
[00:38:56.381 --> 00:38:59.802]  The United States has a long history of false flag terrorism.
[00:39:00.723 --> 00:39:05.744]  But you're taking it a step further by this class action lawsuit and I have to applaud your effort.
[00:39:06.085 --> 00:39:10.326]  Is there a website or is there somewhere that people can go to get more educated on this?
[00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:25.221]  Yes, actually there's a Facebook page called Exposing the Big Three, and that's dedicated to showing all of the information that we can provide from all around the world on these three events.
[00:39:26.002 --> 00:39:33.147]  And also, deepinsidetherabbithole.com is also a website that is able to
[00:39:34.068 --> 00:39:34.549]  Thank you.
[00:39:34.569 --> 00:39:34.789]  Thank you.
[00:39:52.557 --> 00:39:53.618]  Well, fantastic.
[00:39:53.658 --> 00:39:54.559]  More power to you.
[00:39:54.999 --> 00:39:57.101]  Nathan, folks, thank you for joining us.
[00:39:57.401 --> 00:40:05.007]  Keep us updated because I sure would be interested to see how this class action lawsuit goes.
[00:40:05.067 --> 00:40:06.709]  So please keep us updated on that.
[00:40:07.149 --> 00:40:07.429]  I will.
[00:40:07.529 --> 00:40:08.250]  Thanks for having me.
[00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.911]  Awesome.
[00:40:08.931 --> 00:40:09.171]  Thank you.
[00:40:10.407 --> 00:40:11.408]  Well, that was interesting.
[00:40:11.428 --> 00:40:14.132]  We'll definitely have to get him back on when we have more time.
[00:40:14.192 --> 00:40:16.214]  That's going to do it for tonight's broadcast.
