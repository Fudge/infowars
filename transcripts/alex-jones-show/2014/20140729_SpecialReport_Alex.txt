[00:00:06.613 --> 00:00:16.960]  Valley emergency management officials are concerned that the large amount of people here illegally may pose a dangerous situation in the event of a hurricane.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.303]  The Valley's population exceeds 1.3 million people according to the U.S.
[00:00:22.323 --> 00:00:23.124]  Census Bureau.
[00:00:23.624 --> 00:00:26.526]  Add to that another 4,000 people here illegally.
[00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:31.489]  The entire Valley of detention areas will be evacuated first.
[00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:35.352]  In other words, before the public gets their mandatory evacuations.
[00:00:35.692 --> 00:00:42.956]  In a South Texas community, an initiative is in place to give illegal immigrants preference when it comes to emergency evacuation.
[00:00:43.417 --> 00:00:53.943]  I'm not suggesting that American citizens should be evacuated first, but why can't we put an effort into evacuating everyone who is in temporary housing and or dependent on public transportation?
[00:00:54.443 --> 00:00:54.943]  We're good to go!
[00:01:11.468 --> 00:01:16.672]  But if the government is providing said means, why can't they be provided to all people who are in need?
[00:01:16.972 --> 00:01:26.520]  As stories like this become more and more common, residents in other parts of the country are now voicing their opinions of how they are not receiving treatment on level with illegal immigrants.
