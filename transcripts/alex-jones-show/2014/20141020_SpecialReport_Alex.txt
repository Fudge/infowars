[00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:20.205]  In every crisis, whether engineered, natural, or accidental, the Obama administration has exacerbated it as an opportunity for control and manipulation.
[00:00:20.746 --> 00:00:22.288]  The Ebola outbreak is no different.
[00:00:23.302 --> 00:00:32.924]  But there are many people, from the powerless to the political and corporate elites, from hippies to microbiologists like Eric Pianca, who want radical depopulation.
[00:00:33.224 --> 00:00:34.945]  Just look at this letter to the editor.
[00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:45.127]  Of course, it refers to James Lovelock's Gaia Theory, a popular way to sell radical depopulation to the masses, to the very people against whom it will be used.
[00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:50.759]  I see the Earth as more than just a mixture of living things and inanimate matter.
[00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:53.540]  I see it as a tightly coupled entity.
[00:00:53.781 --> 00:01:03.727]  And the way it's presented to the masses, it anthropomorphizes the Earth as a living organism and presents humans not as the stewards of God's created Earth, but as a virus.
[00:01:04.127 --> 00:01:15.255]  And Lovelock himself conveniently plays into their global warming alarmism, talking about global warming being a fever that the planetary organism, the Earth, gets from the virus, the humans.
[00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:22.184]  I like to think of it as a kind of organism and not just a lump of rock with life on it.
[00:01:22.865 --> 00:01:32.457]  Any organism can have periods of ill health and it was pretty unfortunate of us to start worsening the fever that the planet was already in.
[00:01:32.737 --> 00:01:39.921]  And of course environmentalists quickly draw the obvious conclusion that if mankind's a virus, a cancer, it must be eradicated.
[00:01:39.941 --> 00:01:49.565]  And so Gaia has been used to put a pagan, new age, happy face mask on the grim reaper of depopulation and sell it as both necessary and inevitable.
[00:01:50.306 --> 00:01:57.149]  So what do you think is a viable figure that Gaia, that the planet, can sustain?
[00:01:57.907 --> 00:02:02.851]  I would guess, living the way we do, not more than one billion, probably less.
[00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:12.718]  Here you sit saying, we are facing doom, we are facing the possibility of five-sixths of our human population being wiped out within a century.
[00:02:12.798 --> 00:02:15.741]  The theme has been picked up and repeated in popular culture.
[00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:22.566]  There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern.
[00:02:22.586 --> 00:02:24.087]  Do you know what it is?
[00:02:25.668 --> 00:02:26.229]  A virus.
[00:02:28.524 --> 00:02:30.646]  Human beings are a disease.
[00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:33.349]  A cancer of this planet.
[00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:34.811]  You are a plague.
[00:02:36.052 --> 00:02:36.392]  And we...
[00:02:39.022 --> 00:02:42.984]  So how do we get rid of this human virus that threatens our beloved Earth mother, Gaia?
[00:02:43.384 --> 00:02:47.366]  Or, as another scientist puts it, those upright mammalian weeds.
[00:02:47.606 --> 00:02:57.710]  As the Church of Euthanasia puts it in their Gaia Liberation Front proposal, solutions to get rid of the human virus, like nuclear war or sterilization, just aren't as effective as bioengineering.
[00:02:57.951 --> 00:03:03.073]  It has the advantage that it can be done with just one person who has the right technical expertise.
[00:03:03.653 --> 00:03:13.275]  And there are multitudes of people with the technical expertise and the philosophical bent to do this, as Alex Jones pointed out in the documentary, Endgame, seven years ago.
[00:03:13.675 --> 00:03:33.139]  Prominent University of Texas biologist, Dr. Eric Bianca, while receiving an award from the Texas Academy of Science, said that the worldwide AIDS pandemic was, quote, no good, it's too slow, and went on to laud the virtues of Ebola, because it would kill 90% of the world population quickly.
[00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:54.857]  But most frightening was the fact that in a crowd of over 1,000 prominent scientists, local newspapers reported that 95% of those in attendance gave Bianca sustained standing ovations every time he extolled the virtues of mass culling microbes and man's destruction.
[00:04:06.195 --> 00:04:11.979]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:22.186]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:04:22.486 --> 00:04:26.248]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:29.651]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:04:31.852 --> 00:04:38.079]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:40.661]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:43.785]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:04:44.165 --> 00:04:49.671]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.
[00:04:50.091 --> 00:04:56.757]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
