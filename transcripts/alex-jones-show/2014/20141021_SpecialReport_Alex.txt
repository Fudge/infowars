[00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.893]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com with a disturbing update with the war on Ebola.
[00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:19.457]  Now, President Obama has decided to send the National Guard into Western Africa to help fight Ebola.
[00:00:20.378 --> 00:00:21.078]  What does that say?
[00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:25.401]  Number one, we're sending people that don't have any experience whatsoever in life.
[00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:32.366]  They're 18 to 22 years old usually, and now you're going to expect them to go into Western Africa and fight a deadly virus.
[00:00:32.906 --> 00:00:36.849]  Now, scientists who deal with these things, they get 80 hours of training.
[00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.087]  These National Guard soldiers are going to get only four.
[00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:47.983]  Now, is this proof that the government truly does hate American patriots, soldiers, tea partiers, all this?
[00:00:48.323 --> 00:00:49.484]  This is mind-blowing.
[00:00:49.884 --> 00:00:56.466]  Or is this proof that everything that's going on in Africa is a complete and total hoax, and they really have no threat to worry about?
[00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.547]  But I'll leave that up for you to decide.
[00:00:59.027 --> 00:01:00.387]  But just think about it, though.
[00:01:00.507 --> 00:01:05.389]  In the military, to be able to drive your car on base, you have to go through a monthly inspection.
[00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:07.970]  If you don't qualify, you can't drive on post.
[00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:15.093]  If you don't shoot a certain amount of targets within a lot of time, you're not able to qualify to shoot that weapon.
[00:01:15.653 --> 00:01:28.756]  So why are we going to allow soldiers to go into Western Africa and fight Ebola with four hours of training to combat some huge deadly virus that's spreading rampantly through the country supposedly?
[00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:34.628]  Is this another way for Big Pharma to incite fear and push these vaccines?
[00:01:34.988 --> 00:01:38.170]  You know, if you're a student and you don't get the flu shot, you can't come to school.
[00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.932]  If you're a healthcare worker and you don't get the flu shot, you're demonized and you're told to wear a face mask.
[00:01:43.433 --> 00:01:44.733]  So these are things to think about.
[00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:47.495]  Stay tuned for more updates as they unfold.
[00:01:47.635 --> 00:01:49.316]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.

[00:02:08.155 --> 00:02:08.756]  And look at that!
