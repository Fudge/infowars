[00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:08.614]  We're under attack!
[00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:08.975]  We're hit!
[00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:09.497]  We're hit!
[00:00:13.706 --> 00:00:24.452]  Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber is not just satisfied with selling the two stupid American voters a healthcare law based on deception and non-transparency.
[00:00:24.972 --> 00:00:31.616]  No, now Gruber has been exposed as an abortion advocate of the eugenicist variety.
[00:00:31.996 --> 00:00:38.960]  Now, during the Clinton years, Gruber co-authored a paper titled, Abortion Legalization and Child Living Circumstances.
[00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.341]  Who is the marginal child?
[00:00:41.861 --> 00:00:45.003]  He argues that legal abortion had saved the U.S.
[00:00:45.063 --> 00:00:51.486]  taxpayer upwards of $14 billion in welfare benefits and that it also lowered crime.
[00:00:51.947 --> 00:00:56.209]  He argues that abortion of marginal children is a social good.
[00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:10.198]  If these marginal children, or urban poor, had been born, they would have been more likely to live in a single parent household, live in poverty, die in infancy, and be in a household collecting welfare.
[00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.661]  I was raised by a single mother in low to middle class neighborhood.
[00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:17.323]  I even grew up some of those years on food stamps.
[00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:23.027]  But according to Jonathan Gruber, I would have been better off if I had never even been born.
[00:01:23.387 --> 00:01:25.869]  And this is a lie that they sell to these young women
[00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:34.773]  That they might as well just get rid of their children because they'll never be able to make it, and they'll never rise up out of poverty, they won't amount to anything, they won't be able to afford it.
[00:01:35.174 --> 00:01:44.559]  So this is just a huge lie, and let's point out that this is the same exact man who's in charge of drafting our national healthcare law.
[00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:47.120]  So, you know, no need to worry about death panels.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.621]  And also, remember this?
[00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:52.803]  There are also those who claim that our reform efforts would ensure illegal immigrants.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.080]  This too is false!
[00:01:57.221 --> 00:02:03.002]  The reforms I'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally.
[00:02:07.524 --> 00:02:08.344]  It's not true.
[00:02:10.064 --> 00:02:13.365]  And one more misunderstanding I want to clear up.
[00:02:14.586 --> 00:02:15.246]  Under our plan,
[00:02:16.556 --> 00:02:22.457]  No federal dollars will be used to fund abortions, and federal conscience laws will remain in place.
[00:02:22.837 --> 00:02:24.378]  Turns out that was a lie.
[00:02:24.718 --> 00:02:36.580]  According to a new report from the Government Accountability Office, Obamacare is filled with abortion subsidies and plans that indirectly fund the procedure, forcing taxpayers to subsidize abortion.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.442]  And as we've reported before, most of these abortion clinics are set up in black and Hispanic neighborhoods.
[00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:49.894]  In New York alone, there were more black babies killed by abortion than were born in 2012.
[00:02:50.734 --> 00:02:57.139]  And in New York alone, nearly 78% of all abortions performed were of black or Hispanic children.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.504]  Former abortion clinic director Carol Everett exposed that the industry
[00:03:02.924 --> 00:03:09.113]  ...seeks to find a constant stream of new clientele by infiltrating public school systems.
[00:03:09.474 --> 00:03:16.143]  And she also revealed how they specifically seek to target the fastest growing minority groups.
[00:03:16.966 --> 00:03:19.147]  Well, I want you to think of this as a business.
[00:03:19.427 --> 00:03:22.747]  People don't think of it as a business, but they have to expand their market.
[00:03:22.787 --> 00:03:23.808]  And who is their market?
[00:03:23.828 --> 00:03:25.408]  It's the woman who's having an abortion.
[00:03:25.888 --> 00:03:30.209]  And so who is the longest-term customer for an abortion clinic?
[00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:37.131]  It's a woman early in her teens who is going to continue using abortion as a method of birth control throughout her childbearing years.
[00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:39.251]  So they go into the schools.
[00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:42.752]  Our goal was three to five abortions between the ages of 13 and 18.
[00:03:44.375 --> 00:03:47.978]  You cannot just go to these kids when they're 12 and say, I want you to start getting pregnant.
[00:03:48.158 --> 00:03:58.286]  So what we did was we worked to create our market by breaking down the natural modesty, separating the children from their parents and their values, and becoming a sexpert in their lives.
[00:03:58.346 --> 00:03:59.907]  My commission was $25.
[00:04:01.088 --> 00:04:04.170]  My goal was 40,000 abortions a year so I could be a millionaire.
[00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.931]  Wow.
[00:04:04.991 --> 00:04:06.152]  Last month I was there, we did 545.
[00:04:06.192 --> 00:04:06.712]  My income was $13,625.
[00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:18.110]  Were they specifically targeting minority groups here in the public schools to get them to become these repeat clients?
[00:04:19.915 --> 00:04:22.616]  We just have to look at where their facilities are located.
[00:04:22.636 --> 00:04:23.076]  Right.
[00:04:23.636 --> 00:04:29.637]  Until recently, there was not a single abortion clinic located in a white middle class area.
[00:04:29.697 --> 00:04:32.818]  They were all located in black areas.
[00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:44.661]  In 1984, Planned Parenthood came to San Antonio, Texas and hired a Hispanic marketing firm to learn how to market to the Hispanic population, i.e.
[00:04:44.681 --> 00:04:45.701]  the fastest growing
[00:04:46.242 --> 00:04:51.064]  In the nation and the fastest growing in the abortion numbers and in the teen pregnancy numbers.
[00:05:02.301 --> 00:05:04.303]  The Molon Lave Silver Coin.
[00:05:04.603 --> 00:05:06.365]  Certified by the Provident Mint.
[00:05:06.545 --> 00:05:10.789]  This one ounce silver round is .999% fine silver.
[00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:18.717]  Inspired by the legendary Spartan King Leonidas and his refusal to lay down arms in defiance of Emperor Xerxes.
[00:05:18.917 --> 00:05:19.718]  Molon Lave.
[00:05:19.878 --> 00:05:21.539]  That's Greek for come and take it.
