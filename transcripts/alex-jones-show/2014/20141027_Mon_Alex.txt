[00:00:02.728 --> 00:00:05.356]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:16.072 --> 00:00:20.255]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:21.716]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.497 --> 00:00:23.358]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.038 --> 00:00:27.681]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.242 --> 00:00:32.305]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.112 --> 00:00:45.133]  CBS News reports U.S.
[00:00:45.213 --> 00:00:53.037]  soldiers returning from Liberia are held for at least 21 days in Italy on a U.S.
[00:00:53.237 --> 00:01:04.882]  military base before they are allowed to come back into the United States.
[00:01:07.023 --> 00:01:11.505]  But then meanwhile, the CDC, the Centers for Spreading Disease,
[00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:24.235]  Has rebuked the governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, saying you need to release the nurse that you believe came in contact with Ebola and who might have it.
[00:01:25.917 --> 00:01:26.858]  You need to send her home.
[00:01:28.803 --> 00:01:35.886]  I guess like this other doctor that tested positive with Ebola last week and is now going into the more serious bleeding stages of it.
[00:01:36.226 --> 00:01:46.851]  The Associated Press is reporting he needed his freedom as well to go to a restaurant, a bowling alley, ride the most busy A-train, subway, and take taxicabs.
[00:01:49.092 --> 00:01:52.714]  So now Governor Cuomo and Governor Christie of New York and New Jersey
[00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:01.461]  Are both saying that, okay, if somebody's been treating an Ebola patient, and they get a fever and look sick, we're just gonna let them basically do whatever they want.
[00:02:03.462 --> 00:02:15.546]  The default with somebody that has drug immune or drug resistant TB, and there is drug immune, they don't call it that, they don't want to scare the public, but there's TB out there that you can't cure.
[00:02:16.986 --> 00:02:19.767]  They lock you up, sorry, basically for the rest of your life,
[00:02:20.788 --> 00:02:25.830]  Because it will spread, and then hundreds of thousands could die.
[00:02:28.011 --> 00:02:31.952]  Back when they couldn't treat TB, millions and millions died a year in the U.S.
[00:02:32.072 --> 00:02:32.492]  alone.
[00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:38.674]  You know how many famous people, when you read history books, even up to the 1930s and 40s, died?
[00:02:38.714 --> 00:02:42.616]  They had things called sanitariums that weren't mental institutions.
[00:02:42.636 --> 00:02:46.677]  They were like these big convalescent places just full of people that had it.
[00:02:49.158 --> 00:02:54.720]  And it wouldn't matter, you know, even if you could get up and walk around and you could go out and play croquet or a lot of them had swimming pools.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.901]  It was just kind of like a leopard colony.
[00:02:58.301 --> 00:02:59.481]  That's where you lived.
[00:03:00.382 --> 00:03:03.463]  And the nurses and doctors that worked there, in most cases, they had it as well.
[00:03:04.003 --> 00:03:05.964]  So you form your own communities not to spread it.
[00:03:06.344 --> 00:03:09.905]  Well, the new progressive thing to do is to share it.
[00:03:11.205 --> 00:03:13.426]  Don't quarantine people that had HIV early on.
[00:03:13.966 --> 00:03:16.347]  Let it go from just a few dozen to millions that have it.
[00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.310]  Don't quarantine people that have Ebola in the tens of thousands.
[00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.511]  Let millions get it, absolutely!
[00:03:24.451 --> 00:03:27.833]  Everybody else is shutting their borders and blocking the flights for two and a half months now.
[00:03:28.213 --> 00:03:29.073]  Almost two and a half months.
[00:03:30.093 --> 00:03:38.597]  Christie says nurse quarantined for Ebola can go home after he was rebuked by the White House.
[00:03:38.777 --> 00:03:41.918]  NBC News is reporting right now.
[00:03:44.571 --> 00:03:48.772]  So White House presses states to reverse mandatory Ebola quarantine orders.
[00:03:48.912 --> 00:03:52.553]  Obama demands states stop following proper protocol.
[00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:54.014]  New York Times.
[00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:05.117]  Coming up today, Steve Quayle is scheduled to be with us and then Joel Gilbert for a full hour interview.
[00:04:08.258 --> 00:04:12.979]  I tend to not put out talking points like I should so we can all kind of get a grasp
[00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:15.455]  At least on where I'm coming from.
[00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:21.257]  But it's so crystal clear the last few weeks that I should have been beating a drum here.
[00:04:22.317 --> 00:04:26.699]  Because that drum is the truth.
[00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:35.301]  And it's that they're trying to cover up what's really going on with Ebola until the election is over.
[00:04:38.202 --> 00:04:38.822]  In what?
[00:04:39.922 --> 00:04:41.483]  Not that long, like a week from now.
[00:04:42.961 --> 00:04:55.212]  So, they are covering up what's really going on with Ebola, and trying to say there's nothing happening, and they have this spin doctor up there as the czar, who has no medical background, to snow job everybody.
[00:04:55.252 --> 00:05:02.959]  So, we won't find out what's really happening with the Ebola until after the election, but all the signs show there's a huge cover-up going on and we're being lied to.
[00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.762]  We have a special intro coming up that Jakari Jackson put together.
[00:05:07.102 --> 00:05:08.804]  Stay with us, we're live on this Monday.
[00:05:10.134 --> 00:05:11.135]  The experts are clear.
[00:05:11.455 --> 00:05:18.421]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:05:18.561 --> 00:05:24.406]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[00:05:24.827 --> 00:05:28.430]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.451]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:05:32.771 --> 00:05:37.832]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:05:38.092 --> 00:05:38.992]  Not our iodine.
[00:05:39.112 --> 00:05:45.233]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[00:06:03.641 --> 00:06:04.882]  There's a place down in Tennessee

[00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:52.682]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:08.331]  Others don't.
[00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:19.320]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super-oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:29.205]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy-Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:07:29.385 --> 00:07:32.306]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body.
[00:07:32.506 --> 00:07:33.127]  I think so.
[00:07:55.230 --> 00:08:00.297]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.
[00:08:00.417 --> 00:08:06.385]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com to get started with OxyPowder or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:33.742]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:34.102 --> 00:08:35.643]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:37.084 --> 00:08:38.344]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:38.424 --> 00:08:43.746]  It is the 27th day of October 2014.
[00:08:45.407 --> 00:08:53.650]  It is extremely crystal clear now, studying the global Ebola crisis, that Western governments in Europe
[00:08:55.495 --> 00:09:06.423]  In England and other areas are trying to block the Ebola coming in and the United States, the people running it, are doing everything they can to A. bring it in and B. cover up that it's spreading.
[00:09:08.785 --> 00:09:14.088]  Steve Quayle joins us in the second hour today to give us his take and from his sources where he thinks all this is going.
[00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:22.154]  Love him or hate him, he wrote books back in the mid-1990s predicting airborne Ebola would be the false flag here in the United States.
[00:09:22.615 --> 00:09:24.416]  I'm looking forward to hearing what he has to say.
[00:09:28.226 --> 00:09:34.169]  Now, that said, there are two articles up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:34.189 --> 00:09:35.490]  They're also front and center.
[00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.572]  Not hard to find on DrugsReport.com, because it's the top stories there.
[00:09:40.472 --> 00:09:55.860]  CDC rebukes Christie, the nurse who was treating Ebola patient, who was quarantined, basically ordered release by the feds, when the feds don't even have that power, states have quarantine power as well.
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.101]  So if we go to Drudge, we can show folks the front page there.
[00:10:00.501 --> 00:10:05.142]  CDC rebukes Christie, nurse released.
[00:10:05.262 --> 00:10:18.426]  Now, LinkedIn read right down below that, U.S.
[00:10:18.506 --> 00:10:24.868]  soldiers returning from Liberia are being placed in isolation in Vicenza, Italy.
[00:10:26.311 --> 00:10:45.264]  For more than 21 days, CBS News reports, even though they say that they're not showing any signs of having Ebola, that they will be held until they are found to be Ebola-free, and then they will be shipped back to whatever bases they came from, whether it be in Germany or the United States or somewhere else.
[00:10:47.286 --> 00:10:48.847]  Now that is what you're supposed to do.
[00:10:49.327 --> 00:10:54.511]  When you come out of a hot zone as a medical worker or anybody else, you're supposed to be held
[00:10:55.703 --> 00:10:57.664]  In medical quarantine for 21 days.
[00:10:57.985 --> 00:10:59.486]  They have the army bases for it.
[00:10:59.526 --> 00:11:01.007]  They have the hospital ships for it.
[00:11:01.507 --> 00:11:11.074]  The procedure for Doctors Without Borders, I went and looked it up, was sure enough to, depending on what you're treating and how long it incubates, you wait in the country.
[00:11:13.175 --> 00:11:23.062]  After you've been in the hot zone area, in a hotel room or a house, so you can monitor yourself once you're out of the main hot zone on the edge of it, then you get on an airplane or on a boat and come back.
[00:11:24.864 --> 00:11:26.885]  And we know these people aren't self-quarantining.
[00:11:26.925 --> 00:11:34.609]  The doctor last week in New York that was coming back from Africa who had Ebola is now into the next stage of blood coming out of his orifices.
[00:11:35.009 --> 00:11:38.931]  AP is reporting he's now into that stage of his eyes turning red and all the rest of it.
[00:11:40.371 --> 00:11:49.195]  He went to the bowling alley and on the A train subway and to restaurants and to the store and now to the cabs.
[00:11:49.416 --> 00:11:50.416]  Just all over the place.
[00:11:51.236 --> 00:11:52.217]  He's a medical doctor.
[00:11:54.377 --> 00:12:00.142]  We appreciate him trying to fight Ebola, but why would he come back and be sick with a fever running around doing all this?
[00:12:00.202 --> 00:12:05.187]  Why would a nurse from Dallas, who treated the Ebola patient out of fever, call the CDC and say, can I fly?
[00:12:05.447 --> 00:12:07.609]  Oh yes, honey, go ahead.
[00:12:10.112 --> 00:12:14.996]  So in those two articles, you see the dichotomy, the paradox.
[00:12:15.016 --> 00:12:20.161]  We should do an article just on this itself, one of our writers should, or somebody should, pointing out
[00:12:21.601 --> 00:12:26.922]  That the Army quarantines people that have been around Ebola, which you're supposed to do.
[00:12:31.603 --> 00:12:42.926]  And the Obama White House does everything it can to stop states from exercising their rights and their duty to quarantine people that have been around an Ebola patient and that have a fever.
[00:12:45.595 --> 00:12:47.836]  And people are like, Alex, don't push a police state.
[00:12:48.297 --> 00:12:53.980]  It's going to be a police state when this thing gets out of hand, which is very clear is going on right now.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:09.008]  Because once this starts to spread, after the election, once they let us know it's spreading, if that is indeed the case, which it looks like it is, every signpost, every arrow, every alarm, every indicator points at that.
[00:13:09.308 --> 00:13:10.549]  I pray that's not the case.
[00:13:11.667 --> 00:13:13.949]  The public confidence believes it's spreading.
[00:13:14.229 --> 00:13:16.231]  The public is not confident in government.
[00:13:16.251 --> 00:13:17.192]  Those polls are out there.
[00:13:18.373 --> 00:13:19.594]  People know their man lied to.
[00:13:21.396 --> 00:13:24.118]  So we've got this whole pantheon of issues going on.
[00:13:24.178 --> 00:13:32.426]  The military, the Army, is following its procedures and following the law and quarantining U.S.
[00:13:32.546 --> 00:13:33.367]  Army personnel.
[00:13:33.387 --> 00:13:35.428]  5,000 were sent in.
[00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:37.831]  Now when some of them are set to go back out,
[00:13:38.857 --> 00:13:41.259]  Or they're ill, they're being sent to a U.S.
[00:13:41.459 --> 00:13:42.299]  military base.
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.222]  About a five hour flight out of West Africa.
[00:13:46.842 --> 00:13:48.463]  And they land and they're quarantined.
[00:13:49.824 --> 00:13:50.865]  Not here in the U.S.
[00:13:51.205 --> 00:13:55.288]  You're a nurse treating an Ebola patient, you have a fever, honey, you can go.
[00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:04.914]  That's why I marvel that the default position has been turned off and no reasons have been given.
[00:14:09.212 --> 00:14:12.934]  Now we have a five-year-old boy being tested for Ebola at New York City Hospital.
[00:14:14.454 --> 00:14:15.775]  At Bellevue Hospital.
[00:14:17.035 --> 00:14:17.616]  Last night.
[00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:30.441]  And we're getting more reports from medical doctors who are scared of nurses that indeed people that show signs of Ebola bleeding out of every orifice are being disappeared by federal teams.
[00:14:31.401 --> 00:14:34.222]  We've had high-level Border Patrol break that down here as well.
[00:14:34.302 --> 00:14:35.143]  This is going on.
[00:14:36.035 --> 00:14:36.995]  Now, do they have Ebola?
[00:14:37.155 --> 00:14:45.217]  We don't know that, but why would they be disappearing them if it was malaria that only causes bleeding in very rare cases and doesn't look like Ebola?
[00:14:45.978 --> 00:14:51.599]  Why aren't they just putting a slide under the microscope and seeing that the parasite isn't there from malaria?
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.580]  Our story went mega-viral around the web.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:03.122]  We were avalanched, crushed in the response.
[00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:12.453]  From nurses, doctors and others saying either they've seen stuff like this happen or heard about it from other health care professionals.
[00:15:13.334 --> 00:15:19.038]  I hope and pray that it's just panicking and that it, but still people are being disappeared.
[00:15:19.538 --> 00:15:23.180]  That's a huge issue and the controlled corporate press is going along with it.
[00:15:23.421 --> 00:15:28.204]  Notice they had the EAS alert take over all the TV in the country last week and they claim it was a mistake.
[00:15:30.256 --> 00:15:31.657]  A lot of big stuff's going on.
[00:15:31.677 --> 00:15:43.542]  We're going to break it all down, but here is a Jacari Jackson piece put together, a montage, with Captain America that I think is extremely powerful, where art imitates life, or maybe vice versa.
[00:15:43.783 --> 00:15:46.444]  Then we'll come back and get into a bunch of other key news.
[00:15:46.704 --> 00:15:47.184]  Stay with us.
[00:15:55.668 --> 00:15:57.109]  Do you want to kill Nazis?
[00:15:57.129 --> 00:15:58.790]  I don't want to kill anyone.
[00:16:00.526 --> 00:16:01.246]  I don't like bullies.
[00:16:02.287 --> 00:16:03.027]  I don't care where they're from.
[00:16:03.627 --> 00:16:09.970]  I believe Captain America was a composite character that really kind of captured the essence of that generation.
[00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:25.897]  There's another analogy to be taken from Captain America and that is that that generation and America in general has essentially fallen asleep like Captain America did as you see him wake up in the second Captain America movie to find that he's living in an authoritarian police state.
[00:16:26.297 --> 00:16:33.744]  For a second day in a row, a group of World War II vets literally took down a barrier blocking off the World War II memorial in Washington, D.C.
[00:16:33.764 --> 00:16:37.387]  Harry needs his barricades back!
[00:16:37.407 --> 00:16:40.590]  Wow, you seem pretty chipper for someone who just found out they died for nothing.
[00:16:41.311 --> 00:16:41.551]  Wow.
[00:16:41.952 --> 00:16:47.317]  I go protect Iraqis in Iraq, and I come back and I find that my fellow Americans are being attacked by police.
[00:16:52.581 --> 00:16:57.803]  For once, we're way ahead of the curve.
[00:16:59.004 --> 00:17:01.305]  By holding a gun to everyone on earth and calling it protection.
[00:17:01.765 --> 00:17:04.586]  The police and National Guard going street by street.
[00:17:06.207 --> 00:17:06.967]  House to house.
[00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:09.788]  Instructions to disarm anyone inside.
[00:17:10.822 --> 00:17:13.185]  We're gonna neutralize a lot of threats before they even happen.
[00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:15.407]  But the punishment usually came after the crime.
[00:17:15.668 --> 00:17:19.252]  And when they say, I want my lawyer, you tell them, shut up!
[00:17:19.592 --> 00:17:20.233]  Your time is expired.
[00:17:20.253 --> 00:17:20.934]  Get a lawyer.
[00:17:21.475 --> 00:17:22.536]  You're an enemy combatant.
[00:17:23.393 --> 00:17:24.554]  You guys did some nasty stuff.
[00:17:25.234 --> 00:17:25.454]  Yeah.
[00:17:26.395 --> 00:17:27.135]  We compromised.
[00:17:27.375 --> 00:17:29.377]  Sometimes in ways that made us not sleep so well.
[00:17:29.397 --> 00:17:41.064]  When I was in Afghanistan, they usually kept us outside these buildings and the other government agency guys, probably like DEA, CIA and all that, they would go into these kind of rooms like that, exactly, and they would be torturing people from in there.
[00:17:41.284 --> 00:17:44.306]  Horrible scream to hear a grown person like that being tortured.
[00:17:44.346 --> 00:17:46.847]  You're watching as this opium is being grown.
[00:17:46.888 --> 00:17:50.990]  We provide them security, we're providing them resources, and we're providing them alternatives.
[00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:52.191]  Captain America,
[00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:53.972]  Is a fugitive from S.H.I.E.L.D.
[00:17:54.912 --> 00:17:56.033]  With all due respect, if S.H.I.E.L.D.
[00:17:56.093 --> 00:17:58.635]  is conducting a manhunt for Captain America, we deserve to know why.
[00:17:59.015 --> 00:18:06.960]  You have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.941]  This is only going to get worse once it starts.
[00:18:09.081 --> 00:18:11.643]  And again, there's no veterans doing anything right now.
[00:18:12.223 --> 00:18:13.104]  No IEDs.
[00:18:13.224 --> 00:18:16.446]  They are literally getting the police to pick a fight with veterans.
[00:18:17.287 --> 00:18:20.408]  You are standing in my brain.
[00:18:20.648 --> 00:18:22.068]  How did you get here?
[00:18:22.108 --> 00:18:22.809]  Infighted.
[00:18:22.929 --> 00:18:26.469]  It was Operation Paperclip after World War II.
[00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:26.750]  S.H.I.E.L.D.
[00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:29.810]  recruited German scientists with strategic value.
[00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:31.631]  Thought I could help their cause.
[00:18:32.071 --> 00:18:43.034]  Operation Paperclip explores the secret military program that hired scientists who used slave labor to build the V-2 rocket and others who used concentration camp victims for human experiments.
[00:18:43.294 --> 00:19:00.783]  The responsibility for the staggering loss of life and property is uniformly placed on Hitler and the Nazis, but excluded from the official history is the fact that Hitler and the National Socialists would not have risen to power without the help of international bankers and American and German corporations.
[00:19:01.263 --> 00:19:05.105]  She's disabling security protocols and dumping all the secrets onto the Internet.
[00:19:05.125 --> 00:19:06.206]  Including Hydra's.
[00:19:06.346 --> 00:19:06.826]  And S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.
[00:19:07.346 --> 00:19:10.708]  What about Bradley Manning?
[00:19:10.768 --> 00:19:12.149]  What about Bradley Manning?
[00:19:13.777 --> 00:19:18.720]  I think the revelations are terrible because they were revealed.
[00:19:19.721 --> 00:19:20.361]  What's his name?
[00:19:20.381 --> 00:19:21.302]  Snowden.
[00:19:21.982 --> 00:19:23.403]  Yes, Snowden.
[00:19:23.643 --> 00:19:24.584]  I think he's a traitor.
[00:19:25.224 --> 00:19:25.905]  What about the others?
[00:19:26.765 --> 00:19:27.786]  Are you planning a rescue mission?
[00:19:28.086 --> 00:19:34.930]  You think about what is going on with the Veterans Administration Hospital and the fact that we have veterans that are dying because they're on a wait list.
[00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:36.231]  You talk about Sgt.
[00:19:36.271 --> 00:19:38.052]  Tamarisi and his situation.
[00:19:38.312 --> 00:19:40.574]  When you come to, you know, Ken.
[00:19:40.594 --> 00:19:40.834]  Pershing!
[00:19:45.421 --> 00:19:50.224]  It's something that I've been upset about and raised a cane about, so I'm going to ask you about it.
[00:19:50.284 --> 00:19:57.968]  And that's this right-wing extremism report that was mailed out to all law enforcement officials in the United States.
[00:19:58.509 --> 00:20:00.570]  I've apologized for that report.
[00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:02.471]  It was not authorized to be distributed.
[00:20:02.991 --> 00:20:03.632]  This isn't freedom.
[00:20:04.332 --> 00:20:04.832]  This is fear.
[00:20:05.292 --> 00:20:05.633]  S.H.I.E.L.D.
[00:20:05.673 --> 00:20:08.374]  takes the world as it is, not as we'd like it to be.
[00:20:08.474 --> 00:20:12.237]  It's getting damn near past time you were getting with that program, Captain.
[00:20:15.323 --> 00:20:19.846]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:20:20.286 --> 00:20:24.769]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:25.489 --> 00:20:29.452]  Well, great job, Zachary Jackson, with that special piece.
[00:20:29.492 --> 00:20:42.620]  We like to do that, take actual news that's taking place, integrate it in with either old news, or with fiction, or with different pieces of literature,
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:48.523]  To demonstrate common archetypal threads throughout history.
[00:20:48.543 --> 00:20:50.384]  We are skipping this network break.
[00:20:51.265 --> 00:20:53.887]  We are live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:20:53.967 --> 00:20:59.430]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are here Monday through Friday, 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[00:20:59.530 --> 00:20:59.951]  Eastern.
[00:21:02.092 --> 00:21:03.933]  That is 10 a.m.
[00:21:03.973 --> 00:21:04.834]  to 1 p.m.
[00:21:05.094 --> 00:21:06.595]  Mountain, 9 a.m.
[00:21:06.655 --> 00:21:08.696]  to noon Pacific, 11 a.m.
[00:21:08.716 --> 00:21:09.397]  to 2 p.m.
[00:21:09.777 --> 00:21:10.998]  Central Standard Time.
[00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.851]  I gotta hand it to the New York Times.
[00:21:18.892 --> 00:21:33.398]  They either put out horrible, deceptive lies that are over-the-top hoaxes, or they put out really good, serious investigative journalism.
[00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:40.061]  I think the New York Times, overall, for mainstream media, is one of the best publications out there.
[00:21:42.202 --> 00:21:44.163]  For film reviews, you name it.
[00:21:45.950 --> 00:22:01.924]  The problem is, when they're being political, they will use all the credibility of all the amazing writers and journalists they have, they will dump on them, in a big way, by injecting incredible deception.
[00:22:02.525 --> 00:22:11.472]  Whether it's lies about aluminum tubes and yellow cake from Niger for WMDs in Iraq, or saying that the Liberty Movement are a bunch of terrorists,
[00:22:12.435 --> 00:22:17.796]  The New York Times does it a lot, but every day I read the New York Times, there are amazing stories.
[00:22:17.836 --> 00:22:19.056]  There's not a plug for the New York Times.
[00:22:19.436 --> 00:22:24.317]  I'm just noticing two articles I want to cover right now are out of the New York Times.
[00:22:25.518 --> 00:22:30.839]  Lawlets IRS Sees Accounts on Suspicion No Crime Required.
[00:22:32.759 --> 00:22:39.941]  And you can't write an article about this and not say it's horrible tyranny and oppressive and out of North Korea, which they basically say.
[00:22:40.281 --> 00:22:41.821]  You can't report on something
[00:22:43.126 --> 00:22:47.592]  like this and then not illustrate that it's super bad.
[00:22:49.707 --> 00:22:52.829]  Because other news outlets will report on things like this, but they'll say it's wonderful.
[00:22:52.969 --> 00:23:02.013]  MSNBC, whenever the IRS is shaking down churches and going after pro-lifers and going after libertarians and conservatives, they say, good, arrest them all.
[00:23:02.333 --> 00:23:04.735]  Good, take their 501c3 away.
[00:23:04.995 --> 00:23:06.456]  Good, audit everybody.
[00:23:06.616 --> 00:23:09.157]  Good, get rid of free speech on the internet.
[00:23:09.757 --> 00:23:14.720]  Tax the Drudge Report with the Federal Trade Commission or with the
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:22.026]  Securities and Exchange Commission, or with the FCC, bring in the Federal Election Commission.
[00:23:22.206 --> 00:23:24.228]  That's all been called for in the last year.
[00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:29.473]  There's new articles out today, and see, Drudge is the big elephant.
[00:23:30.314 --> 00:23:35.739]  So they can shoot the lead elephant, they can shoot all the other ones right beside it and right behind it.
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:41.244]  There it is, Dems on FCC move to regulate Internet, campaign blogs, and Drudge.
[00:23:43.168 --> 00:23:44.889]  That's being reported by Fox News.
[00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:48.231]  And I went and looked, that's what they said.
[00:23:51.893 --> 00:23:58.736]  So, I don't know, I went off on a jag about the New York Times, but it is a tale of two cities, best of times, worst of times.
[00:23:59.917 --> 00:24:03.699]  I read this article yesterday, and I didn't do the show, David Knight did.
[00:24:05.555 --> 00:24:06.255]  They did an excellent job.
[00:24:06.295 --> 00:24:06.936]  I listened to it.
[00:24:06.956 --> 00:24:09.597]  I had some family issues I had to attend to.
[00:24:10.857 --> 00:24:13.718]  And I said, David, you ought to read this whole article on air.
[00:24:13.958 --> 00:24:17.800]  And I know he read some of it, but I want to read the whole article on air later if I have time.
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:24.803]  Because it lets you know that we are living in an incredible tyranny.
[00:24:25.923 --> 00:24:33.286]  If they can take your life savings and you never even get to see a judge or a jury and there's no indictment, no arrest,
[00:24:34.454 --> 00:24:52.747]  Because the IRS agent claimed it showed structuring by a 70-something year old woman who owns a small restaurant and who has no criminal record because daily she would deposit the money for safety in a quote bank and it was never above $10,000.
[00:24:52.807 --> 00:25:00.793]  That's because at a diner, a little diner, usually it was not more than $1,000 that she would make a day.
[00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:04.611]  People are using credit cards.
[00:25:05.432 --> 00:25:18.042]  And they said the mere fact, and they list a bunch of these cases, that you didn't ever put in more than $10,000 to trigger a suspicious report
[00:25:19.187 --> 00:25:21.690]  One time, I had a big event in L.A.
[00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:25.514]  with several thousand attendants, and we've been selling books and DVDs and made about $20,000.
[00:25:25.754 --> 00:25:34.182]  Sounds like a lot, but only half that's profit, and you gotta pay for stuff, pay for getting everybody out there, but we made about $20,000 over two days.
[00:25:35.384 --> 00:25:41.270]  And each day, because it was on a Friday and a Saturday, we would go over to Bank of America at the time, was the account I had,
[00:25:43.499 --> 00:25:46.980]  And I would go in there and they would go, are you sure you want to deposit this?
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.161]  This will trigger a suspicious report.
[00:25:49.901 --> 00:25:51.122]  And I'm like, what do you mean?
[00:25:51.142 --> 00:25:53.522]  I just sold a bunch of videos and books.
[00:25:53.582 --> 00:25:53.903]  Yeah.
[00:25:53.923 --> 00:25:56.984]  And we're going to pay the stupid tax of the private fellow reserve on this.
[00:25:57.684 --> 00:26:03.946]  Americans are so cowardly now that I've wanted to give out bonuses before.
[00:26:05.464 --> 00:26:08.607]  At Christmas party, maybe $200 here, $200 there.
[00:26:09.067 --> 00:26:10.448]  But to 40-something people, it's like $5,000, $6,000.
[00:26:11.229 --> 00:26:15.812]  And you go to the bank, and they're acting like you're a criminal to do it.
[00:26:15.852 --> 00:26:20.596]  And I even had somebody in my office, I don't want to say cowardly, but like, really, you're going to get cash out?
[00:26:20.676 --> 00:26:23.479]  I mean, how did we ever get like this?
[00:26:23.739 --> 00:26:34.848]  And now the IRS, with a straight face, tens of thousands of times a year, goes in to mainly mom-and-pop restaurants and shoe repair stores and things that they know full well.
[00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:38.271]  Full well do a cash business.
[00:26:39.112 --> 00:26:41.113]  And the smart ones, I guess, just never put it in the bank.
[00:26:41.673 --> 00:26:42.894]  They just go spend it and do stuff.
[00:26:42.954 --> 00:26:43.274]  No, no.
[00:26:43.575 --> 00:26:46.677]  You put it in the bank, there's not even a law.
[00:26:46.717 --> 00:26:47.497]  They claim it's a law.
[00:26:47.517 --> 00:26:48.958]  The New York Times doesn't get that exactly right.
[00:26:49.478 --> 00:27:02.067]  It's the interpretation of an asset forfeiture seizure regulation that the feds put in, and that's how cops will pull you over and corrupt jurisdictions and say they've been federalized in that they get the money from the feds.
[00:27:02.087 --> 00:27:03.628]  They seize it, it goes to the feds.
[00:27:05.629 --> 00:27:09.093]  And they pull an old lady over as their favorite target because they know the M.O.
[00:27:10.275 --> 00:27:16.122]  of older women, especially Depression era, most of them are dead now, to carry a lot of cash on them because they don't trust banks.
[00:27:16.142 --> 00:27:16.863]  Gee, wonder why?
[00:27:16.883 --> 00:27:18.465]  They'll have three, four thousand dollars.
[00:27:18.985 --> 00:27:20.527]  Pull over that old lady, drive a new Cadillac.
[00:27:21.168 --> 00:27:22.209]  Ma'am, you got cash in there?
[00:27:22.229 --> 00:27:23.831]  Well, yes, sonny, I got two thousand dollars.
[00:27:24.732 --> 00:27:24.993]  Really?
[00:27:25.899 --> 00:27:27.420]  They screwed up once with the state police.
[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:32.004]  She was a multi-billion dollar oil baroness whose famous husband had died.
[00:27:32.385 --> 00:27:34.266]  She had like $5,000 in her purse, chicken feed.
[00:27:35.267 --> 00:27:36.988]  And she sued them and made a big deal out of it.
[00:27:37.008 --> 00:27:37.589]  They took her money.
[00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:44.515]  They just said, you come on to the station, we're going to test these bills, we find drugs on any of it, we're going to indict you.
[00:27:46.288 --> 00:27:52.030]  They said, we're taking the money, and they said, if you don't like it, come on into the station, we'll go ahead and, you know, arrest you and then indict you right there.
[00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:53.430]  Or you can just let me have the money.
[00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:55.891]  Well, she drove on down the road and got her lawyers involved.
[00:27:56.291 --> 00:27:59.752]  But the average person doesn't have a billion and a half dollars in the bank.
[00:28:00.952 --> 00:28:04.973]  And isn't an old Texan who thinks it's wrong to have cops grab money out of your purse?
[00:28:05.433 --> 00:28:11.955]  This is pure theft on a monumental stage, and they want to hide it in plain view like it's okay.
[00:28:13.888 --> 00:28:23.132]  It wasn't bad that I didn't want to get mugged in my hotel room for $20,000, and then I went and put it in the bank to then have the accountants run it through the whole system.
[00:28:23.192 --> 00:28:25.673]  But the way the IRS works is they don't care.
[00:28:26.333 --> 00:28:31.295]  They will get 96% conviction rates in IRS court, and they know people are innocent.
[00:28:31.635 --> 00:28:36.637]  They've told people I know, Treasury agents, others that we've had on, that we're criminals.
[00:28:36.797 --> 00:28:37.638]  We know you're innocent.
[00:28:37.758 --> 00:28:40.018]  We want to put you in jail to shut you up.
[00:28:40.939 --> 00:28:43.360]  Congressmen I've interviewed, like Hanson,
[00:28:44.335 --> 00:28:45.156]  No criminal record.
[00:28:45.216 --> 00:28:47.398]  Fighting the IRS in his committee.
[00:28:47.519 --> 00:28:48.680]  They arrested him.
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:49.240]  He beat him.
[00:28:49.701 --> 00:28:50.382]  Arrested him again.
[00:28:50.422 --> 00:28:50.862]  Beat him again.
[00:28:51.122 --> 00:28:58.491]  The next time, threw him on a plane and then drove him around for over a month in a vehicle till his feet burst, shackled, defecating all over himself.
[00:28:59.051 --> 00:29:00.493]  This is a criminal mafia!
[00:29:00.833 --> 00:29:03.356]  And everyone thinks groveling to them will protect you.
[00:29:03.636 --> 00:29:04.077]  It won't!
[00:29:06.144 --> 00:29:06.965]  It's illegitimate.
[00:29:07.245 --> 00:29:08.706]  It's paid to the private Federal Reserve.
[00:29:08.966 --> 00:29:10.146]  People say, well then why do you pay it?
[00:29:10.507 --> 00:29:12.148]  Because I want to get the message out.
[00:29:12.248 --> 00:29:13.188]  I want to fight tyranny.
[00:29:13.528 --> 00:29:24.635]  I want to have every I dotted, every T crossed, triple accounting firms, not even taking some of the exemptions, so that when they do try to set us up, I am lily white.
[00:29:26.396 --> 00:29:27.277]  Like the driven snow.
[00:29:28.137 --> 00:29:29.598]  Nothing on us.
[00:29:30.879 --> 00:29:31.699]  The system doesn't care.
[00:29:34.827 --> 00:29:37.008]  This is their war on small businesses.
[00:29:37.048 --> 00:29:37.948]  You should go read the article.
[00:29:38.188 --> 00:29:39.229]  Another New York Times article.
[00:29:39.689 --> 00:29:40.709]  In Cold War, U.S.
[00:29:40.729 --> 00:29:50.833]  spy agency used 1,000 Nazis to basically command the CIA, FBI, and other agencies.
[00:29:51.533 --> 00:29:52.013]  Well, sure.
[00:29:54.234 --> 00:29:56.454]  People like Klaus Barbie.
[00:29:56.695 --> 00:29:57.135]  Stay with us.
[00:29:57.215 --> 00:29:57.795]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:29:59.426 --> 00:30:02.411]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.431 --> 00:30:06.036]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.325 --> 00:30:12.767]  InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:30:22.837 --> 00:30:29.903]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[00:30:29.983 --> 00:30:30.604]  We're good to go.
[00:30:50.745 --> 00:30:51.305]  We're good to go.
[00:31:10.328 --> 00:31:11.929]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[00:31:12.269 --> 00:31:16.050]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[00:31:16.791 --> 00:31:21.112]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[00:31:21.252 --> 00:31:28.055]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[00:31:28.555 --> 00:31:37.639]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:31:37.859 --> 00:31:43.301]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:50.665]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.

[00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:13.912]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:32:14.072 --> 00:32:18.034]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:32:18.334 --> 00:32:19.795]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:32:20.115 --> 00:32:27.699]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:32:27.979 --> 00:32:28.820]  But for how long?

[00:32:35.763 --> 00:32:38.585]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:32:39.995 --> 00:32:50.203]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[00:32:50.563 --> 00:32:56.928]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:32:57.028 --> 00:32:59.249]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:02.432]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[00:33:02.472 --> 00:33:09.337]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:33:25.848 --> 00:33:28.030]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:33.715]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:37.728 --> 00:33:45.196]  By the way, since I mentioned the FEC, the federal government, wanting to regulate the Drudge Report, they've been making these statements.
[00:33:45.216 --> 00:33:51.882]  Since I mentioned that earlier, why don't I just play Tucker Carlson and the Fox News piece where he discusses this.
[00:33:52.743 --> 00:33:58.409]  So what would it mean to regulate speech on the internet, to regulate these ads, YouTube, Drudge Report?
[00:33:59.259 --> 00:34:01.841]  Well, I think this portends a great threat.
[00:34:02.382 --> 00:34:19.317]  When you look at the internet today, you'll see hundreds of thousands of postings in all forms, from chat rooms, to Facebook and social media, to websites that people build to put out political messages, to YouTube postings, and of course, blogs, right?
[00:34:20.918 --> 00:34:32.785]  People have been doing this for a decade or more now, and the American people have become quite accustomed to going online and picking up political commentary and information.
[00:34:33.025 --> 00:34:41.530]  But, if the Federal Election Commission were to start regulating all of those blogs and websites and social media pages,
[00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:44.592]  I can't imagine what it would take.
[00:34:44.632 --> 00:34:54.380]  It would probably require a team of government regulators calling the Internet daily to look for violators, to look for people who aren't reporting their expenditures online.
[00:34:55.982 --> 00:34:58.284]  What is the cost of a blog, for example?
[00:34:58.324 --> 00:35:03.849]  Would we have to start sending letters out to all these posters saying, how much money did you spend on your blog?
[00:35:04.329 --> 00:35:07.872]  So I can't imagine a regulatory regime reaching deep into the Internet.
[00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:10.394]  It would have a huge effect on American life, that's for sure.
[00:35:10.554 --> 00:35:14.858]  I mean, no offense, everyone respects the FEC, but it's an unelected body.
[00:35:15.478 --> 00:35:19.041]  How would it have the power to regulate political speech on the Internet?
[00:35:19.081 --> 00:35:20.663]  I mean, shouldn't Congress be doing that anyway?
[00:35:21.644 --> 00:35:22.384]  I think you're right.
[00:35:23.765 --> 00:35:25.947]  Let me go back to the point I made just a minute ago.
[00:35:26.908 --> 00:35:36.176]  The only writ that the Federal Election Commission has to regulate political speech at all is to regulate large expenditures to disseminate speech.
[00:35:37.197 --> 00:35:49.086]  The Supreme Court recognized that the reason we do regulate any speech at all is to prevent corruption of the political system and the corruption that can come from contributions to candidates.
[00:35:49.546 --> 00:35:54.570]  But, you know, the internet has been a low-cost mechanism for people to speak and communicate.
[00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:59.434]  They're trying to say that if you promote something, you're pro-gun, you shouldn't be able to do it because that's political.
[00:36:00.265 --> 00:36:03.266]  Or that if you're a church you can't say you're against abortion because that's political.
[00:36:03.747 --> 00:36:06.508]  Everything has a political area to it.
[00:36:07.408 --> 00:36:08.969]  Everything can be called political.
[00:36:09.549 --> 00:36:21.675]  Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or the freedom of the press or of the people to peaceably assemble and to petition their government for a redress of grievances.
[00:36:22.415 --> 00:36:24.036]  You can go read the First Amendment.
[00:36:24.096 --> 00:36:24.957]  It's got the press.
[00:36:25.357 --> 00:36:26.298]  It's got assembly.
[00:36:26.638 --> 00:36:27.999]  It's got demonstrations.
[00:36:28.139 --> 00:36:29.300]  It's got expression.
[00:36:29.721 --> 00:36:31.842]  It's got religious freedom.
[00:36:31.922 --> 00:36:34.144]  That you cannot make a law.
[00:36:34.304 --> 00:36:35.505]  It's not your area.
[00:36:35.945 --> 00:36:36.806]  Common sense!
[00:36:38.247 --> 00:36:42.250]  Bloomberg can spend a hundred million dollars in the last three years.
[00:36:43.191 --> 00:36:44.432]  That was in Bloomberg last week.
[00:36:44.452 --> 00:36:47.994]  He spent over a hundred million dollars of his money.
[00:36:49.255 --> 00:36:50.937]  Gotten from Wall Street insider deals.
[00:36:52.162 --> 00:36:58.768]  To try to get people like Mike Martinez, elected mayor, who says, I want to confiscate all guns.
[00:37:00.029 --> 00:37:03.371]  And he's got enough Californians coming into Austin to do it, if he had his way.
[00:37:03.932 --> 00:37:09.396]  To try to get rid of the sheriff in Milwaukee that said, buy guns and protect yourself.
[00:37:09.797 --> 00:37:11.158]  $500,000 got spent trying to get rid of him.
[00:37:12.059 --> 00:37:13.380]  Brought in out of New York City.
[00:37:15.359 --> 00:37:16.320]  I don't blame New Yorkers.
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:17.441]  They hate their political class.
[00:37:17.481 --> 00:37:23.765]  But what is New York doing in Wisconsin and in Texas telling people what to do?
[00:37:25.026 --> 00:37:30.750]  Oh, but Bloomberg can give his money all day because it's not political that he wants to restrict guns and Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.
[00:37:34.599 --> 00:37:35.499]  I think I'm gonna throw up.
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.181]  Bloomberg himself, from his own personal money, gave $150,000.
[00:37:39.101 --> 00:37:41.303]  But you add all the Bill Gatesy and PACs together, $500,000.
[00:37:42.283 --> 00:37:59.953]  But Dinesh D'Souza got three or four friends to give the maximum together in a pool, didn't fill out the right paperwork to try to get his friend elected to the Senate, running for Hillary's seat, and he is now spending nine months in a jail.
[00:38:01.889 --> 00:38:06.191]  And the Orwellian headline was, Dinesh D'Souza escapes prison.
[00:38:08.693 --> 00:38:10.493]  Evades being able to go to prison.
[00:38:10.514 --> 00:38:14.776]  And you read, he's being locked up in one of those minimum security things they don't call a prison.
[00:38:15.656 --> 00:38:18.318]  Because there's two million people in medium and maximum security.
[00:38:18.678 --> 00:38:21.999]  Another five million in these other lockdown facilities.
[00:38:22.019 --> 00:38:26.382]  They don't like the fact that we have more prisoners anywhere else in the world, so they don't call it prisons.
[00:38:26.662 --> 00:38:28.503]  It's all games, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:30.686 --> 00:38:33.528]  Now, I want to get into the Nazi rat line.
[00:38:33.969 --> 00:38:37.732]  I want to get into law lets IRS seize accounts on suspicion.
[00:38:38.412 --> 00:38:39.273]  No crime required.
[00:38:39.593 --> 00:38:42.696]  How about a headline, law lets government agents rape your daughters.
[00:38:44.277 --> 00:38:48.020]  I mean, if they passed a law like that, would it be legitimate or would it be illegitimate?
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:53.945]  I don't care if you have a law that black people got to go out and put a yoke around their neck and pull a plow.
[00:38:54.265 --> 00:38:55.306]  The law is a fraud.
[00:38:56.775 --> 00:39:07.758]  I don't care if you interpret some regulation you passed, you know, back in the 80s, a reign of terror to quote legalize government robbing old people mainly.
[00:39:08.319 --> 00:39:14.941]  They mainly target old people that are right at retirement age because they know they just freak out and go have a heart attack and their kids don't help them.
[00:39:15.641 --> 00:39:16.761]  I've identified that pattern.
[00:39:17.742 --> 00:39:20.742]  And the IRS says they've done a great job.
[00:39:20.783 --> 00:39:21.943]  They're very proud of themselves.
[00:39:24.085 --> 00:39:31.988]  Arnold's Park, Iowa, for almost 40 years, Carol Hinders has dished out Mexican specialties at her modest, cash-only restaurant.
[00:39:33.308 --> 00:39:44.072]  For just as long, she deposited the earnings at a small bank branch a block away, until last year, when two tax agents knocked on her door and informed her that they had seized her checking account, almost $33,000.
[00:39:46.243 --> 00:39:47.644]  By the way, you don't get it back.
[00:39:48.345 --> 00:39:51.388]  The Internal Revenue Service agents did not accuse Ms.
[00:39:51.408 --> 00:39:53.590]  Schindler of money laundering or cheating on her taxes.
[00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:55.792]  In fact, she had not been charged with any crime.
[00:39:55.832 --> 00:40:06.702]  Instead, the money was seized solely because she had deposited less than $10,000 at a time, which they viewed as an attempt to avoid triggering a required government report.
[00:40:07.003 --> 00:40:10.186]  She went on and explained with her receipts that she'd never made $10,000.
[00:40:11.857 --> 00:40:13.577]  Well, she hadn't made $10,000 in a week!
[00:40:14.378 --> 00:40:15.538]  That's why the deposits were $500, $1,000, $600.
[00:40:16.118 --> 00:40:20.619]  And they just said, it doesn't matter, Cupcake.
[00:40:21.359 --> 00:40:22.739]  We interpret this as that.
[00:40:23.239 --> 00:40:24.200]  Your money's ours.
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:40.143]  And there's other people in this article who've spent hundreds of thousands trying to get hundreds of thousands back, and the government will pile in with everything they've got to make sure you've got to spend millions to get it back, because they want to continue this premeditated, racketeering, organized crime practice, and that's what it is.
[00:40:41.971 --> 00:40:43.071]  Now let's expand on that.
[00:40:43.211 --> 00:40:45.672]  Remember the fellow we had on a couple times a couple years ago?
[00:40:45.692 --> 00:40:46.653]  I hate to look up his name.
[00:40:47.393 --> 00:40:52.635]  Headline from CBS News with a straight face in Chicago was, Man Faces Life in Prison for Filming Police.
[00:40:54.435 --> 00:40:57.656]  They come out to his junkyard that his parents had, that he owns, they're dead.
[00:41:00.577 --> 00:41:03.819]  And they haul off a bunch of his 50's cars that are worth tens of thousands a piece.
[00:41:04.619 --> 00:41:06.259]  And they say, well we've changed the zoning now.
[00:41:06.539 --> 00:41:08.800]  You used to live out in the county, well we call it the city now.
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:10.341]  We're taking your cars.
[00:41:11.178 --> 00:41:12.838]  So he filmed him, so they arrested him.
[00:41:13.858 --> 00:41:14.679]  Michael Allison.
[00:41:17.259 --> 00:41:20.060]  Just type in the headline, Michael Allison faces life in prison.
[00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:28.761]  And he faced, because of the concurrent sentences, because then he went and filmed him again, life in prison.
[00:41:28.801 --> 00:41:38.523]  And the state sent a state attorney down and pushed for the maximum conviction until the judge said, this is Twilight Zone, I'm ordering this case dropped.
[00:41:39.775 --> 00:41:40.535]  Guess what they did?
[00:41:41.096 --> 00:41:43.317]  The state put money in to try to unseat that judge.
[00:41:44.057 --> 00:41:46.818]  I mean, these people are authoritarian crazies.
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:54.782]  They want to take old ladies, everything they got out of the bank.
[00:41:55.923 --> 00:41:57.644]  No judge, no jury, no arrest, no nothing.
[00:41:58.384 --> 00:42:02.046]  They want to arrest and disappear whoever they can.
[00:42:02.506 --> 00:42:05.888]  They want to put Michael Allison with no criminal record.
[00:42:06.795 --> 00:42:10.879]  A grease monkey that works on cars and owns his own scrap yard.
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.422]  Probably a fun guy to go play poker with.
[00:42:15.042 --> 00:42:16.904]  They don't like that!
[00:42:17.004 --> 00:42:18.665]  You're not a big giant box store.
[00:42:19.026 --> 00:42:20.327]  You're not allowed to have lemonade stands.
[00:42:20.347 --> 00:42:21.748]  You're not allowed to have farmer's markets.
[00:42:21.908 --> 00:42:23.109]  They're shutting them down everywhere!
[00:42:23.549 --> 00:42:28.414]  They don't want little people getting together and going down to the corner store and buying enchiladas!
[00:42:32.093 --> 00:42:34.514]  By the way, I saw the article David Knight covered it yesterday.
[00:42:34.534 --> 00:42:37.996]  Will you guys print it where the illegal alien shot two cops out in California?
[00:42:38.836 --> 00:42:41.758]  And he'd been deported twice and had all these felonies.
[00:42:42.298 --> 00:42:50.102]  And I saw another story where they're still fighting and putting money in to try to unseat any sheriff that will report to ICE.
[00:42:50.622 --> 00:42:57.405]  La Raza, Mechia, the Democratic Party, will come run against even Democrats in places like Travis County.
[00:42:58.626 --> 00:43:01.327]  If they follow the federal law they haven't been able to repeal,
[00:43:05.862 --> 00:43:06.782]  There it is, Sacramento.
[00:43:06.902 --> 00:43:10.544]  Area cop shooting suspect had already been deported twice, Breitbart.
[00:43:11.284 --> 00:43:13.325]  And had this huge felony record.
[00:43:17.286 --> 00:43:26.430]  And then, if you arrest someone and you report that they've got felonies and run that through to ICE, do you know what the Democratic Party does?
[00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:30.991]  They come and try to throw you out of your Democrat or Republican.
[00:43:31.472 --> 00:43:35.053]  This is crazy, total criminal gang energy.
[00:43:36.001 --> 00:43:39.442]  Where we're going to take old ladies' bank accounts for no reason.
[00:43:39.782 --> 00:43:45.105]  We're going to arrest people that film us and try to put them in jail for life on their own property, at their junkyard.
[00:43:45.685 --> 00:43:52.027]  We're going to let people go that have attacked and have felonies and have been deported twice so they can kill cops.
[00:43:55.189 --> 00:43:56.189]  It is Twilight Zone.
[00:43:56.689 --> 00:43:58.610]  So I want to be clear, it's not the average cops.
[00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:01.151]  It's not even the average bureaucrat or even the average IRS person.
[00:44:02.679 --> 00:44:23.654]  That is a hardcore criminal, but it is the people running the system that are, and more and more of the criminal energy is so strong that they are boldly trying to crush everyone's will and just come completely out with the most outrageous stuff you can imagine to set the precedent to do whatever they want in this country.
[00:44:26.479 --> 00:44:36.588]  There are hundreds of thousands of asset forfeiture seizure cases a year in this country where no drugs or anything illegal is found and it turns out in court the money is completely legitimate.
[00:44:39.171 --> 00:44:43.815]  Someone would have to be crazy to keep all their cash in a bank or keep all their precious metals in a bank.
[00:44:44.235 --> 00:44:44.876]  Hedge your bets.
[00:44:46.647 --> 00:44:52.773]  And all the time you'll hear about, they'll SWAT team someone because they were rumored to have $300,000 worth of gold.
[00:44:53.054 --> 00:44:54.375]  California's really bad on this.
[00:44:54.635 --> 00:45:08.369]  They SWAT team people for as little as $100,000 in gold because a quote, informant, tells them and then they come and take your gold and you go, here's my receipts, I bought this gold after tax money.
[00:45:08.389 --> 00:45:09.831]  And they go, oh, you gotta prove that.
[00:45:11.158 --> 00:45:13.298]  The government is out of control.
[00:45:13.318 --> 00:45:14.219]  Do you understand that?
[00:45:14.579 --> 00:45:17.759]  It's turning into a third world country, or worse!
[00:45:19.179 --> 00:45:22.020]  Hugo Chavez didn't do stuff like this, and he was bad!
[00:45:26.941 --> 00:45:34.162]  It's outrageous, and it just goes on, and they put it in the New York Times, and admit it's horrible, but no one gets in trouble.
[00:45:37.002 --> 00:45:38.063]  And everybody's scared!
[00:45:38.443 --> 00:45:40.023]  That only encourages this!
[00:45:42.679 --> 00:45:45.040]  Meanwhile, the illegal aliens are above the law.
[00:45:46.721 --> 00:45:47.942]  Actually above the law.
[00:45:53.344 --> 00:45:56.986]  We have a source inside the military base, high level.
[00:45:58.424 --> 00:45:59.125]  Where U.S.
[00:45:59.145 --> 00:46:04.570]  troops are reportedly being quarantined, being watched for Ebola, that have just been in West Africa battling Ebola.
[00:46:05.752 --> 00:46:07.113]  We are investigating right now.
[00:46:08.074 --> 00:46:09.335]  We have breaking news coming up.
[00:46:09.456 --> 00:46:10.437]  Just gonna throw that out there.
[00:46:10.477 --> 00:46:11.398]  Might be at the end of the show.
[00:46:11.418 --> 00:46:11.918]  Might be earlier.
[00:46:11.958 --> 00:46:12.499]  Might be tomorrow.
[00:46:12.919 --> 00:46:14.060]  But we're on it right now.
[00:46:15.162 --> 00:46:19.086]  With SSG Joe Biggs and all of his amazing sources.
[00:46:22.073 --> 00:46:23.173]  That's why we've got Joe in here.
[00:46:23.193 --> 00:46:29.256]  He's got a lot of great sources, and he's willing to get in there, get shot with rubber bullets, go down to the border, get the job done.
[00:46:29.296 --> 00:46:29.876]  That's what I like.
[00:46:32.317 --> 00:46:34.197]  They say folks don't want to hire veterans for whatever reason.
[00:46:34.577 --> 00:46:37.979]  All the veterans I got working here are some of the only people that do exactly what I tell them when I tell them.
[00:46:38.299 --> 00:46:41.780]  I just say, go do this, weld, and he goes and does it, because you're in the Air Force.
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:43.621]  Or Joe Biggs, go do this, and he goes and does it.
[00:46:43.861 --> 00:46:44.681]  It's very refreshing.
[00:46:44.901 --> 00:46:45.681]  I got great crew.
[00:46:45.701 --> 00:46:49.203]  This crew does exactly what we want, because they do a fabulous job in here every day.
[00:46:49.503 --> 00:46:49.963]  It's just that that
[00:46:50.976 --> 00:46:54.239]  Military mindset of getting the job done is amazing.
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:55.621]  But I digress.
[00:46:58.224 --> 00:47:02.628]  GMOs may be to blame for spike in kids suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
[00:47:02.648 --> 00:47:03.209]  I'm going to cover that.
[00:47:03.249 --> 00:47:04.190]  It's very important.
[00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:10.897]  And it ties into a major biotech firm facing legal blitz over genetically modified corn.
[00:47:13.109 --> 00:47:16.590]  CDC finally admits that Ebola can float through the air three feet.
[00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:20.551]  Frontline health care workers must protect themselves from aerosol transmission.
[00:47:20.791 --> 00:47:25.852]  Well, we don't need the CDC to tell us this.
[00:47:25.932 --> 00:47:30.894]  It was kind of like six, seven years ago, Perino, the press secretary, was being asked, is there inflation?
[00:47:30.934 --> 00:47:32.314]  Is that why oil prices are up?
[00:47:32.734 --> 00:47:34.154]  She said, well, I'm not going to comment on that.
[00:47:34.475 --> 00:47:39.896]  As if we need to know from her whether there was oil inflation because of a devalued dollar at the time.
[00:47:41.963 --> 00:47:44.164]  Is it daytime outside, Perino?
[00:47:46.824 --> 00:47:49.045]  Can I wipe my hind end now, Perino?
[00:47:49.865 --> 00:47:54.326]  Is it wrong the IRS is taking people's bank accounts for absolutely no reason and admitting it?
[00:47:56.466 --> 00:47:57.907]  Is child molestation wrong?
[00:47:58.507 --> 00:47:59.747]  Is robbing banks wrong?
[00:48:00.607 --> 00:48:01.928]  Is robbing old ladies wrong?
[00:48:02.128 --> 00:48:03.488]  We already have a conscience.
[00:48:03.748 --> 00:48:04.908]  We know what's right and wrong.
[00:48:05.088 --> 00:48:07.009]  We can't let them define reality anymore.
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:09.721]  So that's all coming up.
[00:48:09.741 --> 00:48:11.083]  I'm going to do my daily ritual here.
[00:48:11.123 --> 00:48:12.404]  I forgot to do this this morning.
[00:48:12.985 --> 00:48:18.651]  So I'm going to double down, if you're a TV viewer, with the secret sauce that won't be here for another week or two.
[00:48:18.671 --> 00:48:20.753]  A little squirt of that.
[00:48:22.115 --> 00:48:24.678]  Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine.
[00:48:25.238 --> 00:48:26.520]  Nice healthy dose of that.
[00:48:28.587 --> 00:48:32.530]  Silver Bullet from Infowarslife.com, 30 parts per million.
[00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:38.214]  I don't usually take this every day, but with all the stuff going on in the season that's here, I take it many times a day, three times a day.
[00:48:38.554 --> 00:48:45.739]  Fluoride shield, chelating not just fluoride but other heavy metals, supercharging the body's defenses and capacity to defend itself.
[00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:54.506]  And then, the super male vitality for clarity, energy, and a healthy dose of Popeye-like libido.
[00:48:55.808 --> 00:48:59.710]  Strong to the finish, because I eat my spinach.
[00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:01.071]  I'm Popeye the Sailor Man.
[00:49:05.453 --> 00:49:06.594]  What was his nemesis name?
[00:49:06.814 --> 00:49:07.214]  Bluto?
[00:49:08.475 --> 00:49:09.776]  I will gladly pay you Tuesday.
[00:49:09.796 --> 00:49:10.396]  Was that Wimpy?
[00:49:12.357 --> 00:49:13.438]  He always wants hamburgers?
[00:49:14.799 --> 00:49:15.579]  I forget his name.
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:21.603]  The point is, is that I'm strong to the finish because I take six caplets a day
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:42.692]  This may be too much for some people, because it is certified, patented to regrow nerves, and so if you've got old injuries and stuff, or areas that have gone numb, like my torn Achilles, started coming back, personally, when I started taking DNA Force with the CoQ10, the BioPQQ, and so many other things, in nutraceutical, organic levels, that nobody else can counter.
[00:49:43.112 --> 00:49:46.574]  Other formulas that aren't even as strong are twice to four times the price.
[00:49:48.175 --> 00:49:49.096]  ...of DNA Force.
[00:49:49.176 --> 00:49:50.198]  It is a game changer.
[00:49:50.278 --> 00:50:00.470]  Infowarslife.com and your purchase of Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine that I believe is just as important as, uh, colloidal silver when it comes to the type of things we're facing right now.
[00:50:00.490 --> 00:50:03.013]  Uh, the silver bullet, all of it.
[00:50:03.193 --> 00:50:04.114]  The lung cleanse.
[00:50:04.654 --> 00:50:05.716]  Oh, I need to do the lung cleanse.
[00:50:06.216 --> 00:50:06.537]  Here it is.
[00:50:07.864 --> 00:50:10.384]  Lung cleanse has a whole bunch of essential oils and things in it.
[00:50:10.785 --> 00:50:12.305]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:50:13.085 --> 00:50:15.765]  I'm not going to go over all the things it's got in it.
[00:50:15.805 --> 00:50:17.346]  Go to Infowarslife.com and read about it.
[00:50:17.726 --> 00:50:19.266]  But it is thick and oily.
[00:50:19.306 --> 00:50:21.466]  It's not just some mist with some menthol in it.
[00:50:21.886 --> 00:50:22.627]  Three times in the mouth.
[00:50:24.847 --> 00:50:25.547]  And then suck in.
[00:50:26.407 --> 00:50:27.928]  Then I take my DNA force.
[00:50:27.948 --> 00:50:29.068]  Just got to make a ritual out of it.
[00:50:29.088 --> 00:50:31.968]  I've never been a vitamin guy until I got into these and it's changing my life.
[00:50:31.988 --> 00:50:33.629]  People can see my skin looks better.
[00:50:33.669 --> 00:50:34.249]  I'm losing weight.
[00:50:34.809 --> 00:50:35.569]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:50:38.928 --> 00:50:56.057]  Or InfoWarsStore.com will get you to the big major site with all the subdivisions like InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsHealth.com, Made in U.S., Made in 1776.com, Made in America, Patriot, Molon Labe Apparel, and your purchase supports the entire transmission.
[00:50:56.317 --> 00:51:02.920]  We have the new camo long-sleeve Molon Labe shirts that are becoming a bestseller, ball caps and more, perfect in time for Christmas.
[00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:04.481]  I know that's politically incorrect.
[00:51:04.521 --> 00:51:06.062]  Christmas, Christmas, Christmas, Christmas, Christmas.
[00:51:06.442 --> 00:51:07.402]  Rachel Maddow doesn't like it.
[00:51:07.502 --> 00:51:08.323]  Christmas, Christmas, Christmas.
[00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:12.511]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[00:51:12.631 --> 00:51:16.653]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[00:51:16.954 --> 00:51:18.174]  Silverlungs.com.

[00:53:08.936 --> 00:53:11.959]  In today's unstable environment, self-protection is critical.
[00:53:12.019 --> 00:53:15.983]  Civil unrest, riots, looting, it's happening now, right here in the United States.
[00:53:16.303 --> 00:53:17.664]  And your rights are at risk.
[00:53:17.904 --> 00:53:21.988]  If passed, HR 5344 would ban level 3 and above body armor.

[00:53:41.415 --> 00:53:43.976]  But surviving is not recreation.
[00:53:44.176 --> 00:53:46.698]  And man wasn't made to live underground.

[00:54:20.771 --> 00:54:29.866]  By the way, just a note on Infowarslife.com and the survival shield, nascent iodine X2 from the deep earth crystal source that nobody else has.
[00:54:31.482 --> 00:54:34.725]  Let's just supercharge my body, my energy, everything.
[00:54:35.526 --> 00:54:38.509]  It's that missing link that the system doesn't want people to know about clearly.
[00:54:38.529 --> 00:54:46.017]  At the current rate, we're going to shell out of it very, very quickly, and we've got a 10-week lead time on getting it in.
[00:54:46.397 --> 00:54:51.222]  We have put in another order, but it's got to be manufactured in the laboratory.
[00:54:51.322 --> 00:54:53.224]  It's a deadly gas.
[00:54:54.185 --> 00:54:56.946]  Uh, the form that we have from pure crystals, it turns into a gas.
[00:54:57.426 --> 00:55:01.628]  It has to be, uh, done basically by people in spacesuits, uh, that, uh, produce it.
[00:55:01.888 --> 00:55:05.309]  We're showing video of it in a Petri dish right now being heated up a tiny crystal.
[00:55:06.190 --> 00:55:09.531]  Uh, so again, other iodine does not come from this pure deep earth source.
[00:55:10.291 --> 00:55:11.492]  It comes out of seaweed.
[00:55:11.512 --> 00:55:13.654]  It is chemically extracted, so there's byproducts.
[00:55:13.674 --> 00:55:14.434]  This is the only.
[00:55:14.454 --> 00:55:15.535]  I don't like it.
[00:55:15.555 --> 00:55:16.136]  It is the best.
[00:55:16.216 --> 00:55:16.536]  Like it.
[00:55:16.876 --> 00:55:19.238]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:55:19.298 --> 00:55:25.503]  And I'm just saying that because Weldon just walked in and told me we're selling out quicker than we thought.
[00:55:26.003 --> 00:55:28.645]  We had tried to... Notice we haven't sold out of this in about six months.
[00:55:28.905 --> 00:55:29.866]  We used to always sell out.
[00:55:30.106 --> 00:55:31.207]  We finally bought a ton of it.
[00:55:32.336 --> 00:55:38.639]  And I had to, of course, get more, jump through all the DEA hoops and the rest of it, and get the crystals.
[00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:41.861]  And then now we're busy trying to get it manufactured again.
[00:55:41.941 --> 00:55:44.102]  So you better order your Survival Shield X2.
[00:55:44.502 --> 00:55:46.063]  It's a great gift for friends and family.
[00:55:46.103 --> 00:55:46.663]  You name it.
[00:55:47.063 --> 00:55:48.664]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:55:48.904 --> 00:55:54.987]  But be sure and consult your healthcare provider or physician before using it because you will go through a detox within two to three weeks.
[00:55:55.247 --> 00:55:55.768]  It's not a game.
[00:55:56.887 --> 00:56:00.428]  It's not a joke, and what it's done for my skin and everything else is just off the chart.
[00:56:01.008 --> 00:56:02.188]  And iodine has changed my life.
[00:56:02.308 --> 00:56:13.271]  And so, as I got into iodine the last three years, I became an expert, and I innovated, and we now have brought you... Original Survival Shield is excellent, but Survival Shield X2 is just off the chart.
[00:56:13.291 --> 00:56:16.231]  We have plenty of original Survival Shield, but it may be all you can get if it sells out.
[00:56:16.791 --> 00:56:17.972]  So, that's the way this goes.
[00:56:18.032 --> 00:56:19.072]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:56:20.812 --> 00:56:20.932]  Or 888-253-3139.
[00:56:20.952 --> 00:56:22.453]  I'm gonna stop plugging right there.
[00:56:25.885 --> 00:56:27.886]  We do have Steve Quayle coming on, right?
[00:56:28.566 --> 00:56:29.907]  That's a Roger Roger confirmed?
[00:56:29.927 --> 00:56:31.688]  I know there was some debate.
[00:56:31.708 --> 00:56:36.430]  I wanted to get him on for two hours, but we already had another guest set up, so we've been debating whether we'd move Steve Quayle.
[00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:37.710]  He is 100% set up.
[00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:41.092]  He's gonna be back on Thursday for a part two.
[00:56:41.132 --> 00:56:41.532]  Good, good.
[00:56:42.172 --> 00:56:42.993]  Okay.
[00:56:45.054 --> 00:56:45.814]  Here's the headline.
[00:56:46.274 --> 00:56:47.015]  CNS News.
[00:56:47.395 --> 00:56:49.736]  Suspect in killing of deputies was twice deported.
[00:56:50.156 --> 00:56:52.737]  It's not that I hate the illegals, period.
[00:56:53.017 --> 00:56:54.378]  A lot of them are hard-working, good people.
[00:56:55.751 --> 00:57:04.320]  It's that they're above the law, and if a sheriff or police department reports that they're felons, this is in the news, the Democratic Party comes after you.
[00:57:04.801 --> 00:57:15.412]  Why does the Democratic Party want illegals to be godlike, above the law, and then every criminal running from justice worldwide comes to the United States?
[00:57:16.803 --> 00:57:17.764]  But it's an unwritten rule.
[00:57:17.784 --> 00:57:21.146]  If you're a criminal from Africa or Europe, they actually report it.
[00:57:21.406 --> 00:57:25.329]  It's like a Hispanic mafia, but it's not even a Hispanic mafia.
[00:57:25.349 --> 00:57:28.331]  Hispanics don't want criminals running rampant on the streets.
[00:57:28.951 --> 00:57:30.352]  I've seen no numbers showing that.
[00:57:31.172 --> 00:57:43.721]  Why do the Democratic Party and the Republicans aiding and abetting them want unlimited criminal illegals with huge felony records not being deported using any fake name they want
[00:57:44.901 --> 00:57:52.163]  Robbing and stealing and home invading in Chicago and in Detroit and in New York.
[00:57:53.443 --> 00:57:58.444]  If you look up the crime waves, there's always been the black on black is the baseline crime wave.
[00:57:59.064 --> 00:57:59.624]  Killing each other.
[00:57:59.664 --> 00:58:00.864]  It's terrible, but that's what's going on.
[00:58:03.525 --> 00:58:09.326]  Charles Barkley came out and said, why are black folks the only people on average that think having a prison record gives you street cred?
[00:58:09.366 --> 00:58:10.086]  That needs to change.
[00:58:10.747 --> 00:58:12.347]  He put out statements and was attacked for it.
[00:58:13.291 --> 00:58:16.192]  But that does go on with the whole gangster culture being pushed by MTV.
[00:58:16.492 --> 00:58:21.174]  But separately, you've got Latin America emptying out all its criminals.
[00:58:21.474 --> 00:58:24.675]  Kind of like Fidel sent all his criminals over in the Cuban boat lift.
[00:58:25.455 --> 00:58:27.116]  It's not that Cubans are criminals.
[00:58:27.956 --> 00:58:32.938]  On average, it's that that was a couple hundred thousand criminals out of jails.
[00:58:33.678 --> 00:58:40.860]  And that's what Latin America does, is use the United States like a giant toilet to dump all the criminals.
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:46.201]  And they're just running around robbing, killing, molesting, drunk driving.
[00:58:46.422 --> 00:58:47.422]  I am sick of it!
[00:58:47.842 --> 00:58:49.182]  Something has to be done!
[00:58:49.202 --> 00:58:51.423]  It's like the political correctness.
[00:58:51.483 --> 00:58:53.944]  We can't stop flights out of Africa because it'd be racist!
[00:59:00.174 --> 00:59:01.414]  Another major health threat.
[00:59:01.434 --> 00:59:06.335]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:59:06.415 --> 00:59:09.036]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:59:09.076 --> 00:59:15.857]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:59:16.117 --> 00:59:18.998]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:59:19.118 --> 00:59:22.038]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:59:22.058 --> 00:59:24.058]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:59:24.078 --> 00:59:26.959]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:59:27.039 --> 00:59:32.521]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:59:32.741 --> 00:59:36.223]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:59:36.243 --> 00:59:39.224]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:59:39.344 --> 00:59:46.447]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[00:59:46.647 --> 00:59:49.708]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[00:59:56.311 --> 00:59:56.772]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:59:56.932 --> 00:59:57.974]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:15.987 --> 01:00:16.627]  Big Brother.
[01:00:17.308 --> 01:00:18.328]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:19.069 --> 01:00:20.170]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:20.830 --> 01:00:21.630]  You want answers?
[01:00:22.411 --> 01:00:23.311]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.952 --> 01:00:27.594]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:28.154 --> 01:00:32.197]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:34.719 --> 01:00:38.481]  Steve Quayle, first guy I ever heard talking about airborne Ebola coming after everybody.
[01:00:39.402 --> 01:00:40.743]  Joins us coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:40.763 --> 01:00:48.207]  He'll be with us an hour today, on this Monday, and an hour on Thursday, because you can't just do one hour with Steve Quayle of SteveQuayle.com.
[01:00:50.188 --> 01:00:54.391]  Okay, let me try to hit as much news as I can in this short segment before we go to Steve Quayle.
[01:00:57.873 --> 01:00:59.834]  I just mentioned this and it makes me really angry.
[01:01:03.763 --> 01:01:07.085]  You know, I get mad at the police a lot because the globalists are trying to corrupt them.
[01:01:07.566 --> 01:01:13.169]  There are a lot of bad police departments and bad cops out there, but by and large, police are some of the most awake, dedicated people I've found.
[01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:18.313]  And folks that heard me 10 years ago asked, why have you gone into this police butt-kissing frenzy?
[01:01:18.593 --> 01:01:18.973]  I'm not.
[01:01:19.053 --> 01:01:23.876]  I've just gotten older, got more contacts, learned more, and where we get our info.
[01:01:24.337 --> 01:01:26.778]  And the police, on average, are one of the most awake groups.
[01:01:27.098 --> 01:01:29.360]  Not as much as the military, but secondarily.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.922]  The public is the group that's not that awake.
[01:01:32.722 --> 01:01:36.123]  And I don't want to get into it for a lot of reasons, plus the police still don't want me to.
[01:01:37.203 --> 01:01:39.784]  This is an ongoing investigation in case others were involved.
[01:01:40.384 --> 01:01:51.706]  A guy came out here from California, staked out wrong places, all these wrong addresses people think I work at, and later told people he was going to kill me and he was there waiting to do it.
[01:01:51.726 --> 01:01:54.047]  The Austin police found out about it.
[01:01:55.051 --> 01:01:57.453]  Through people out in California, through police out there.
[01:01:57.813 --> 01:01:59.294]  He also made threats to law enforcement.
[01:02:00.074 --> 01:02:00.755]  Got on him.
[01:02:01.395 --> 01:02:03.056]  Picked him up, but couldn't charge him.
[01:02:03.536 --> 01:02:05.137]  That's what Arne Sevedo told me eight months ago.
[01:02:05.158 --> 01:02:08.400]  You know, somebody was here to kill you, and we stopped him, so better not be bashing us.
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:10.121]  He didn't really say that.
[01:02:10.141 --> 01:02:11.422]  He goes, you know, you ought to be nicer to us.
[01:02:12.482 --> 01:02:13.683]  He said, oh, no, we're just doing our job.
[01:02:14.283 --> 01:02:16.605]  And then I learned the police went after him out there, and he killed one of them.
[01:02:17.605 --> 01:02:22.188]  And so it's just weird to sit here and realize that this kind of stuff's going on.
[01:02:22.208 --> 01:02:24.330]  And then you hear about two cops being killed.
[01:02:25.779 --> 01:02:31.864]  By an illegal alien, and I'm not even supposed to say illegal alien, but political correctness, who had a big felony rap sheet and had been deported twice!
[01:02:32.104 --> 01:02:33.465]  And now they're not even going to deport them!
[01:02:38.669 --> 01:02:44.694]  These illegals, there was that railway killer that they think killed over 15 women, mainly Hispanics.
[01:02:45.014 --> 01:02:53.661]  That's another thing, these illegal aliens prey on Hispanics and Hispanic areas because for whatever reason they think they can get away with it better there.
[01:02:54.611 --> 01:03:00.646]  And so, this crime wave, just like the black crime wave is hitting blacks the worst, this crime wave is hitting Hispanics the worst.
[01:03:01.673 --> 01:03:02.474]  And it is bad.
[01:03:03.395 --> 01:03:11.663]  A man suspected of killing two deputies during a shooting rampage in Northern California was deported twice to Mexico and had a drug conviction, federal authorities said Saturday.
[01:03:12.143 --> 01:03:24.816]  The suspect shooter told Sacramento County Sheriff's investigators that the 34-year-old of Salt Lake City, Marcelo Marquez of Salt Lake City, however, his fingerprints match the biometric records of Louis
[01:03:25.993 --> 01:03:29.975]  Monroy Bacamonte in Federal Database, U.S.
[01:03:30.015 --> 01:03:34.378]  Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Vice, said.
[01:03:37.539 --> 01:03:40.641]  And that's the thing is, these people are above the law.
[01:03:40.961 --> 01:03:43.383]  They can have 5, 6, 7, 8 different identities.
[01:03:45.724 --> 01:03:51.067]  I'll never forget a senator, a state senator out of Colorado, he was the leader of the Senate at the time, came on my show like 10 years ago, this was in the Denver Post.
[01:03:52.102 --> 01:03:53.403]  I saw the article called and got him on.
[01:03:53.924 --> 01:04:00.569]  He went and in a matter of hours got five consular matricular cards under different comic book character names.
[01:04:01.030 --> 01:04:09.557]  He went in, a big white guy, into the Mexican embassy, sat there in line and went through the line five times and got five different fake names.
[01:04:09.897 --> 01:04:13.600]  And with those, you can go get a bank account, a car, a house, everything.
[01:04:15.222 --> 01:04:17.323]  It's just a fraud bonanza.
[01:04:18.143 --> 01:04:23.007]  And my question is, why are the Democrats, why are the Feds doing this advertising?
[01:04:23.047 --> 01:04:23.668]  You got kids?
[01:04:23.708 --> 01:04:24.529]  Want to come have a baby?
[01:04:24.869 --> 01:04:25.410]  Want to come here?
[01:04:25.450 --> 01:04:26.110]  Got a disease?
[01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:26.531]  Come here.
[01:04:26.751 --> 01:04:27.351]  Got Ebola?
[01:04:27.391 --> 01:04:27.752]  Come here.
[01:04:28.432 --> 01:04:30.194]  We won't quarantine you, we'll give you free health care.
[01:04:31.115 --> 01:04:32.756]  It is the plan to wreck the country.
[01:04:33.056 --> 01:04:34.578]  It is the plan to implode the nation.
[01:04:34.838 --> 01:04:41.424]  And then when there's a giant crime wave, they can say, oh, give us a bigger police state, give up more of your liberties, we'll protect you from it.
[01:04:43.502 --> 01:04:46.024]  And I wonder, are the police going to put up with this forever?
[01:04:46.365 --> 01:04:48.307]  Because I read the news every day religiously.
[01:04:48.347 --> 01:04:49.408]  Hundreds of articles I scan.
[01:04:50.268 --> 01:04:52.791]  Every couple days I read about an illegal killing a cop or two.
[01:04:52.811 --> 01:04:58.076]  And if you look at the crime statistics, they lead the movement of cop killers.
[01:04:58.096 --> 01:05:01.359]  So, are you going to do anything about it?
[01:05:02.139 --> 01:05:07.805]  Or are you going to just let the globalists allow armies of criminals to come up here and kill whoever they want, including you?
[01:05:10.305 --> 01:05:13.807]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:05:13.967 --> 01:05:17.930]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:19.691]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:05:20.031 --> 01:05:27.595]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:05:27.875 --> 01:05:28.736]  But for how long?
[01:05:29.016 --> 01:05:35.280]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:38.482]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:05:39.878 --> 01:05:50.060]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.

[01:06:10.589 --> 01:06:11.651]  In the near future.
[01:06:11.931 --> 01:06:16.076]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:06:16.437 --> 01:06:17.478]  Security alert.
[01:06:17.658 --> 01:06:19.400]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:06:19.661 --> 01:06:23.225]  Analysis, InfoWars, building, independent media operation.
[01:06:23.245 --> 01:06:25.989]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that...
[01:06:26.089 --> 01:06:28.210]  We are the ones responsible.
[01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:29.170]  Crime Directive.
[01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:30.690]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:33.611]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:06:33.671 --> 01:06:36.732]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:06:36.912 --> 01:06:39.133]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:06:39.193 --> 01:06:40.733]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:06:40.753 --> 01:06:43.014]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:06:43.574 --> 01:06:45.254]  They're never going to stop.
[01:06:45.514 --> 01:06:53.776]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:06:53.836 --> 01:07:03.918]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:07:04.198 --> 01:07:05.559]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[01:07:05.579 --> 01:07:06.319]  You can feel it.
[01:07:09.110 --> 01:07:10.091]  The experts are clear.
[01:07:10.411 --> 01:07:17.397]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[01:07:17.537 --> 01:07:23.362]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[01:07:23.803 --> 01:07:27.406]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[01:07:27.526 --> 01:07:31.427]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[01:07:31.747 --> 01:07:36.788]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[01:07:37.049 --> 01:07:37.969]  Not our iodine.
[01:07:38.069 --> 01:07:41.650]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[01:07:41.890 --> 01:07:44.210]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[01:08:07.343 --> 01:08:16.451]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:16.811 --> 01:08:19.073]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:31.599 --> 01:08:33.621]  We're here, my friends, live 11 a.m.
[01:08:33.842 --> 01:08:34.302]  to 2 p.m.
[01:08:34.362 --> 01:08:36.324]  Central Standard Time weekdays.
[01:08:36.965 --> 01:08:43.952]  We're also back 7 o'clock Central weeknights with InfoWars Nightly News with the entire InfoWars News team.
[01:08:44.673 --> 01:08:45.854]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[01:08:46.374 --> 01:08:50.679]  A lot of breaking news up on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:51.980]  Amtrak
[01:08:53.089 --> 01:08:56.492]  Purchasing train tickets with cash is suspicious activity.
[01:08:57.392 --> 01:09:01.055]  CVS posts CDC Ebola info at stores.
[01:09:01.075 --> 01:09:02.676]  I want to go get video of that.
[01:09:03.577 --> 01:09:07.160]  Some see mysterious truck convoys as government conspiracy.
[01:09:08.101 --> 01:09:11.263]  Dim Boss says Tea Party more extreme than ISIS.
[01:09:12.964 --> 01:09:14.506]  She said that on television.
[01:09:15.066 --> 01:09:19.169]  How will the stock market react to the end of quantitative easing?
[01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.970]  An important article.
[01:09:22.918 --> 01:09:24.700]  Another report, they just want the money.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:28.044]  The IRS can now seize accounts on suspicion alone.
[01:09:28.124 --> 01:09:32.789]  No judge, no jury, no indictment, no nothing to create a total chilling effect.
[01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:40.197]  And this just in, federal judge tosses Tea Party suits seeking permanent protection from IRS targeting.
[01:09:41.087 --> 01:09:41.547]  That's right.
[01:09:41.767 --> 01:09:50.413]  The groups are still being targeted by the Democrats, and their speech is being targeted in violation of the First Amendment.
[01:09:50.513 --> 01:09:51.914]  Truly outrageous.
[01:09:51.934 --> 01:09:58.678]  And here's the New York Times headline, Lawlets IRS Seize Accounts on Suspicion No Crime Required.
[01:09:58.998 --> 01:10:05.282]  And it lists the old ladies, you name it, with no criminal record, who just deposit small amounts of cash and even pay taxes on it.
[01:10:05.322 --> 01:10:06.823]  They say, we don't care if you pay taxes.
[01:10:07.563 --> 01:10:11.044]  We are going to take it because we think you're structuring.
[01:10:11.324 --> 01:10:12.984]  No judge, no jury, no crime.
[01:10:14.444 --> 01:10:21.006]  They just have a blank check asset forfeiture seizure that they interpret to make themselves beyond North Korean thugs.
[01:10:22.566 --> 01:10:25.007]  And everybody else, I guess, just grovels in fear of this.
[01:10:28.947 --> 01:10:31.528]  The Army, Army Maj.
[01:10:31.608 --> 01:10:31.948]  Gen.
[01:10:31.988 --> 01:10:36.309]  has come out and said, is quarantining troops at a base in Italy.
[01:10:37.466 --> 01:10:45.552]  Getting into the Ebola news now, and going to our guest, Steve Quayle, CDC finally admits that Ebola can float through the air.
[01:10:46.513 --> 01:10:47.394]  Three feet, they say.
[01:10:47.454 --> 01:11:02.005]  No, the Army report that we posted last week that Kit Daniels wrote about on Infowars.com, headline, Army manual says Ebola can go airborne in cold temperatures.
[01:11:02.986 --> 01:11:04.347]  And that's indeed what it says.
[01:11:04.387 --> 01:11:07.129]  It doesn't get killed by the sunlight or by the heat.
[01:11:10.054 --> 01:11:12.896]  So those reports are up on Infowars.com right now.
[01:11:13.236 --> 01:11:30.888]  I want to go to Steve Quayle of SteveQuayle.com because he was the first person back in 1995-96, and he wrote about it before that, but I read his book, who said that they were developing airborne Ebola as a plan to reduce world population.
[01:11:31.128 --> 01:11:34.330]  Quite frankly, I had him on and thought, I think this guy's for real.
[01:11:34.370 --> 01:11:37.372]  He means what he says, but I think he's gone over the deep end.
[01:11:37.432 --> 01:11:38.353]  I don't think it's this bad.
[01:11:39.170 --> 01:11:41.971]  Until then, they declassified that they had developed airborne Ebola.
[01:11:44.553 --> 01:11:51.176]  And then he said they're chemtrailing and spraying aerosols to dim the sun, and then they declassified that about a decade after.
[01:11:51.216 --> 01:11:54.097]  He was the first I saw to write about that in, like, 94, 93.
[01:11:54.978 --> 01:11:56.558]  He trailblazed so much of it.
[01:11:57.199 --> 01:12:00.840]  And I would have him on just out of interest, because I knew some of it had to be true, because I'd researched it.
[01:12:02.101 --> 01:12:03.762]  But it was simply mind-blowing.
[01:12:06.147 --> 01:12:13.311]  How many things he first documented and reported on, and he's been really freaking out lately, the last year or so, saying, wait for the Ebola.
[01:12:13.692 --> 01:12:25.659]  Well, here's Rolling Stone that I was in a few years ago, and the headline, this was from March 17th issue, 2011, with Snooki on the cover, and you
[01:12:31.087 --> 01:12:38.531]  Tune to page 50, it says, the most paranoid man in America, how talk radio host Alex Jones is trying to overthrow the global Stasi Borg state.
[01:12:38.891 --> 01:12:40.072]  This is before Snowden came out.
[01:12:40.152 --> 01:12:41.833]  We are in a global Stasi Borg state.
[01:12:42.273 --> 01:12:43.694]  One conspiracy theory at a time.
[01:12:44.014 --> 01:12:49.377]  And look, my conspiracy theory was, government lab produced airborne Ebola, Jones thunders.
[01:12:49.518 --> 01:12:51.018]  It's coming your way.
[01:12:52.159 --> 01:12:53.340]  Enjoy it, yuppies.
[01:12:54.824 --> 01:13:06.526]  And of course they don't mention that I went on to read a government document on air, or that we do things like play clips from NOVA, admitting the Army was messing with Airborne Ebola, and indeed had created it.
[01:13:08.187 --> 01:13:18.089]  And it's funny, I was rereading this article this weekend, people pointed this out, it reads like a future prediction manual, like prophecy.
[01:13:19.949 --> 01:13:23.150]  Jones reaches more people than any conspiracy crank in US history.
[01:13:24.830 --> 01:13:26.711]  What do they have intellectually that wrote this?
[01:13:26.851 --> 01:13:27.831]  Oh, just call me a crank.
[01:13:30.993 --> 01:13:34.414]  It's much easier to call me the most paranoid man in America.
[01:13:34.735 --> 01:13:37.116]  No, I'm not the most paranoid man in America.
[01:13:37.976 --> 01:13:38.656]  I'm informed.
[01:13:39.377 --> 01:13:42.318]  Now, Steve Quayle joins us.
[01:13:42.818 --> 01:13:52.643]  He is a top survivalist, been a syndicated broadcaster for 20 plus years, written scores of books, gotta be 20 books, he can correct me, stevequayle.com, he hosts the Q-Files,
[01:13:54.008 --> 01:14:02.118]  And he joins us for the next 45 minutes, actually five minutes to the next hour, and then he'll be back Thursday for a full hour, maybe even two hours with us on Thursday.
[01:14:02.579 --> 01:14:06.243]  We'll do two hours if he can do it so we can take an hour of calls.
[01:14:07.512 --> 01:14:09.094]  Steve, thank you for coming on.
[01:14:09.114 --> 01:14:13.678]  I want to play a clip from the intro for World War Z, coming up a little bit later.
[01:14:14.079 --> 01:14:26.231]  That movie came out last year, and they talk about airborne Ebola in the intro, or they're guessing what the disease is, they don't know, and saying, but the UN has decided to not halt air travel out of the areas affected.
[01:14:26.632 --> 01:14:28.233]  Is this part of predictive programming?
[01:14:28.313 --> 01:14:28.974]  What's happening?
[01:14:29.254 --> 01:14:30.476]  What are your military sources?
[01:14:30.876 --> 01:14:33.760]  Telling you, Steve Quayle, what's the next shoe to drop?
[01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:38.005]  Is Obama covering up the Ebola spread ahead of the election?
[01:14:38.887 --> 01:14:41.150]  Or do they really have it contained, Steve Quayle?
[01:14:42.483 --> 01:14:46.686]  Alex, good morning and to all your listeners, you know, greetings.
[01:14:46.746 --> 01:14:50.048]  First of all, let me share what Ebola isn't immediately.
[01:14:50.088 --> 01:14:54.171]  This is not the hemorrhagic fever that is of the filovirus.
[01:14:54.211 --> 01:15:09.901]  This is a bioweapon that has been genetically altered, that has been patented by the Center for Disease Creation, not controlled, that basically has the coordinating vaccines already in the lab vials ready to give out.
[01:15:10.021 --> 01:15:11.202]  And one of the things that really
[01:15:11.662 --> 01:15:16.123]  Troubles me, and everybody can use three basic facts to search for the truth.
[01:15:16.523 --> 01:15:18.003]  Number one, there is no blood.
[01:15:18.023 --> 01:15:35.027]  Hemorrhagic fever is a biosafety level 4 pathogen that is a virus that is so deadly that the people that deal with it in all the bio labs around the world always have positive pressure suits, they have negative pressure laboratories, and the point being, Alex,
[01:15:35.527 --> 01:15:39.330]  Is that just as the old commercial said, where's the beef and the hamburgers?
[01:15:39.650 --> 01:15:41.231]  This is where's the blood in this?
[01:15:41.592 --> 01:15:44.074]  This is a psychological operation.
[01:15:44.534 --> 01:15:48.857]  It is a bio weapon that is subpar to the Ebola.
[01:15:49.698 --> 01:15:52.800]  Ebola was first defined and actually articulated in 1976.
[01:15:54.969 --> 01:16:15.304]  The bottom line is, at that point it had an 88% kill ratio, and Alex, I just put up on my website, I have a link up on the very top right hand side, stevequayle.com, all the news from your site and others on Ebola to try and make a central, if you will, site for people to come to and get the latest news on that.
[01:16:15.925 --> 01:16:23.190]  Obviously we're dealing with something that is unique in the fact that there is no independent verification that this is Ebola.
[01:16:24.022 --> 01:16:38.152]  You know, it's funny you say that, because a high-level CIA retiree, Steele, said three weeks before this popped up that they were going to release an Ebola simulant, a real biological, but a cover for Ebola, and a cover for something else.
[01:16:38.992 --> 01:16:46.598]  And then, now on top of that, Obama came out, as you know, last week and said, this is a trial run for a more deadly airborne.
[01:16:46.858 --> 01:16:48.039]  Are they throwing it in our face?
[01:16:48.729 --> 01:16:49.329]  Yes, they are.
[01:16:49.429 --> 01:16:55.652]  They've always thrown our face, and it is the Illuminati protocol to mock the stupid people they intend to kill.
[01:16:55.672 --> 01:16:57.333]  I want to say that one more time.
[01:16:57.453 --> 01:17:01.534]  It is the Illuminati protocol to mock the people they intend to kill.
[01:17:01.574 --> 01:17:06.316]  Not only are they telling you how they're going to do it, even when they're doing it, and let's just look at the Ebola czar.
[01:17:06.416 --> 01:17:10.058]  I think you covered this too on your website and on an article.
[01:17:10.438 --> 01:17:14.680]  This is one of the head eugenicists in all the world, okay?
[01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:18.144]  I mean, this guy is A-W-O-L.
[01:17:18.405 --> 01:17:20.968]  Absent without love, okay?
[01:17:21.028 --> 01:17:22.711]  Not just leave, but without love.
[01:17:23.131 --> 01:17:31.743]  When you're talking about... You remember when you and I used to talk about the globalists wanting just to destroy pretty much nine-tenths of the world's population, Georgia Guidestones and all that stuff?
[01:17:32.692 --> 01:17:37.880]  What does it say when a man who should be taking charge is totally silent?
[01:17:38.301 --> 01:17:40.524]  Number one, Ebola has been weaponized.
[01:17:40.744 --> 01:17:48.196]  It has been absolutely part of the bioweapons program of not only the United States, but of Russia and China.
[01:17:48.916 --> 01:17:59.325]  In 1992, Ken Allebeck basically defected, bringing the news to the West, which by the way was greeted with disdain, contempt, and mockery of Ebola pox.
[01:17:59.766 --> 01:18:03.349]  What people have got to understand is this is the
[01:18:03.909 --> 01:18:13.493]  Quintessential weapon of mass destruction and just as Alex quoted Obama and just as this is a trial run, Ebola has been aerosolized.
[01:18:13.533 --> 01:18:18.335]  When I first broke the news on chemtrails and thank you for giving me that credit, very few people do.
[01:18:18.955 --> 01:18:35.172]  What I was concerned with, it would be, if you will, an atmospheric petri dish or an atmospheric laboratory that was basically building the atmosphere up or poisoning the atmosphere so at some later date it would be the ultimate dispersal
[01:18:35.652 --> 01:18:36.212]  I don't know.
[01:18:52.623 --> 01:19:13.918]  At some point in history to introduce us this is why they're saying that in the winter Ebola becomes more quote aerosolized because again they have given it such a charge Alex meaning an electrical charge that it binds with the chemicals the chemtrails spray therefore it falls out and by the way I had on a phone conversation the man that was
[01:19:14.438 --> 01:19:15.139]  We're good to go.
[01:19:44.214 --> 01:19:49.116]  Steve, I believe you.
[01:19:49.657 --> 01:19:50.857]  You're always on the cutting edge.
[01:19:50.957 --> 01:19:58.621]  I want to come back then, give you the floor, and hear from you what you believe it really is, why there's a stand-down, why there's a cover-up.
[01:19:58.641 --> 01:20:01.122]  Do you agree that there's clearly a cover-up?
[01:20:01.342 --> 01:20:05.324]  We're getting reports they're disappearing people out of hospitals from medical doctors that I know.
[01:20:05.584 --> 01:20:06.645]  They're going on record.
[01:20:06.665 --> 01:20:08.486]  There's so much more coming up.

[01:21:26.962 --> 01:21:29.703]  I generally suffer through an asthmatic breathing type situation.
[01:21:30.423 --> 01:21:33.304]  My breathing is shallow and generally constricted in the nose and lungs.
[01:21:33.964 --> 01:21:39.188]  After consuming one world away today, I have tremendous energy and also notice my breathing is free.
[01:21:39.949 --> 01:21:46.314]  I can feel the air in my left nostril and it is free all the way to my abdomen, which is pretty remarkable because I rarely get that feeling.
[01:21:46.974 --> 01:21:49.356]  Being a singer, I love feeling this unrestricted voice.
[01:21:50.036 --> 01:21:53.260]  The only thing new I've actually added to my routine is One World Way.

[01:22:45.083 --> 01:22:47.404]  And if House Bill H.R.

[01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:16.742]  And in a word, the answer is protection.

[01:24:18.977 --> 01:24:34.095]  There may come a time sometime in the future where we are dealing with a airborne disease that is much easier to catch and is deadly and in some ways this has created a trial run for
[01:24:36.326 --> 01:24:39.008]  Federal, state, and local public health officials.
[01:24:39.028 --> 01:24:39.328]  There you go.
[01:24:39.628 --> 01:24:40.989]  Steve Quayle is our guest.
[01:24:41.089 --> 01:24:42.170]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:24:42.190 --> 01:24:47.073]  His site, SteveQuayle.com, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com are our sites.
[01:24:47.673 --> 01:24:48.894]  Okay, Steve, this is a short segment.
[01:24:48.914 --> 01:24:49.714]  You've got the floor.
[01:24:50.074 --> 01:24:57.119]  You've told us what you really think it is, and there's a lot of evidence pointing towards what you're saying from your sources and watching this from day one.
[01:24:57.979 --> 01:24:59.140]  Are they disappearing, people?
[01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:00.321]  That's the intel we've got.
[01:25:00.401 --> 01:25:01.241]  How big is it?
[01:25:02.302 --> 01:25:04.843]  Is this part of a larger plan that another government launched this?
[01:25:05.144 --> 01:25:05.644]  What do you know?
[01:25:08.174 --> 01:25:08.855]  We're good to go.
[01:25:26.087 --> 01:25:26.487]  We're good.
[01:25:41.201 --> 01:25:41.641]  We're good to go.
[01:26:09.688 --> 01:26:10.409]  Let me stop you.
[01:26:10.449 --> 01:26:11.970]  Dr. Francis Boyle, who wrote the U.S.
[01:26:12.010 --> 01:26:14.312]  Biological Weapons and Anti-Terrorism Law,
[01:26:30.874 --> 01:26:43.103]  He was on last Friday and said, it's in the New York Times, he said, Alex, they produced what's now being released at Galveston at the UT Level 4 facility that's in Level 2 that we'd always talked so much about.
[01:26:43.704 --> 01:26:49.208]  And of course, Dr. Pianca at UT says, get ready, the airborne Ebola's coming, you're all gonna die, ah ha ha.
[01:26:49.668 --> 01:27:03.575]  I freaked out, connected the dots, the FBI did visit him over it, but this is really getting creepy when I've got former top CIA people, I've got the guy that wrote the Biological Weapons Treaty and law, I've got you, I've got all these sources saying the same thing.
[01:27:03.595 --> 01:27:04.475]  This is pretty wild.
[01:27:04.795 --> 01:27:05.696]  What's the endgame?
[01:27:05.776 --> 01:27:06.456]  What is it then?
[01:27:07.937 --> 01:27:10.398]  He was saying it's merged, he was saying it's merged, that's what I forgot to say.
[01:27:10.638 --> 01:27:16.401]  He's saying this new Ebola is meant to tie in to all these other known diseases and start super spreading.
[01:27:16.441 --> 01:27:17.041]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:27:19.645 --> 01:27:20.946]  We're good to go.
[01:27:37.355 --> 01:27:37.696]  We're good.
[01:27:54.258 --> 01:27:55.298]  We're good to go.
[01:28:24.269 --> 01:28:25.830]  And this is what my sources are saying.
[01:28:26.210 --> 01:28:27.110]  It's too late.
[01:28:27.211 --> 01:28:28.811]  You guys can't stop it.
[01:28:29.311 --> 01:28:33.193]  Although we can't stop it, we can save as many lives as possible.
[01:28:33.653 --> 01:28:37.815]  And obviously, we're going to look at and have to look at self-quarantine.
[01:28:38.175 --> 01:28:46.679]  And look at the fact, on the 17th of October, New York was being prepped for the Ebola outbreak.
[01:28:47.079 --> 01:28:50.861]  And almost to the day, a week later, it happens.
[01:28:51.301 --> 01:28:54.282]  Now, look, Alex, that has nothing to do with fear-mongering.
[01:28:54.302 --> 01:29:00.763]  It has nothing to do with... When we report, and you've done an exemplary job of always documenting, but you know what?
[01:29:01.263 --> 01:29:05.084]  People don't want to think, because number one, it's too scary.
[01:29:05.364 --> 01:29:07.384]  Number two, it involves personal responsibility.
[01:29:07.684 --> 01:29:12.545]  And number three, the outcome is more than they can psychologically or emotionally handle.
[01:29:12.986 --> 01:29:16.766]  So when all of your experts... I'm talking to molecular biologists.
[01:29:16.806 --> 01:29:17.146]  Same thing.
[01:29:17.206 --> 01:29:18.347]  I'm talking to generals.
[01:29:19.907 --> 01:29:24.211]  Let me just say this, for everybody that wanted to know, it was the basis of the movie Outbreak.
[01:29:24.231 --> 01:29:31.516]  That was a purely biological, race-specific weapon dumped in Africa.
[01:29:31.556 --> 01:29:35.420]  And I still maintain, Alex, that this is a race-specific weapon.
[01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:44.627]  When they rush the people back to America, they're looking for any antibodies that they may not have identified in the three
[01:29:46.784 --> 01:29:49.066]  So it is a test, as Obama said, to soup it up.
[01:29:49.086 --> 01:29:50.166]  That's what Boyle's saying.
[01:29:50.407 --> 01:29:51.627]  It's what Wayne Madsen's saying.
[01:29:51.928 --> 01:29:52.708]  It's what you're saying.
[01:29:53.048 --> 01:29:56.811]  And then now the czar over Ebola says there's too many black people in Africa.
[01:29:56.831 --> 01:29:59.032]  That's the number one issue is getting rid of those folks.
[01:29:59.733 --> 01:30:00.413]  Unbelievable.
[01:30:00.433 --> 01:30:01.514]  It's so clear.
[01:30:01.834 --> 01:30:02.895]  Stay there, Steve Quayle.
[01:30:03.195 --> 01:30:05.937]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:05.957 --> 01:30:06.818]  I mean, it's so clear.
[01:30:10.223 --> 01:30:19.728]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:30:19.868 --> 01:30:29.633]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:30:29.793 --> 01:30:32.715]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[01:30:32.935 --> 01:30:33.536]  I think so.
[01:30:47.892 --> 01:30:48.152]  We're good.
[01:31:10.782 --> 01:31:16.164]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:31:17.424 --> 01:31:22.166]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:31:22.566 --> 01:31:29.349]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:31:31.290 --> 01:31:34.531]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:31:35.351 --> 01:31:37.612]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:31:49.445 --> 01:31:51.326]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:31:51.586 --> 01:31:53.086]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:31:53.366 --> 01:31:55.947]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:31:56.247 --> 01:32:00.308]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[01:32:00.328 --> 01:32:02.509]  So you can ride all day with confidence.

[01:32:05.570 --> 01:32:07.010]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:32:07.170 --> 01:32:07.610]  Got it.
[01:32:07.951 --> 01:32:08.751]  Others don't.
[01:32:10.072 --> 01:32:11.713]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[01:32:12.013 --> 01:32:15.794]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[01:32:16.555 --> 01:32:20.876]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[01:32:21.016 --> 01:32:27.799]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[01:32:28.319 --> 01:32:37.403]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:32:37.603 --> 01:32:43.048]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[01:32:43.168 --> 01:32:50.434]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.

[01:33:21.312 --> 01:33:23.132]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[01:33:23.832 --> 01:33:25.612]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.613 --> 01:33:27.973]  It's your source of information!
[01:33:27.993 --> 01:33:30.213]  It's your live source of information!
[01:33:30.233 --> 01:33:36.215]  50,000 unstoppable watts!
[01:33:36.235 --> 01:33:36.675]  Anthrax!
[01:33:37.155 --> 01:33:38.675]  Anthrax!
[01:33:39.555 --> 01:33:40.176]  And radio!
[01:33:40.276 --> 01:33:42.276]  And radio!
[01:33:43.156 --> 01:33:43.876]  And liquor!
[01:33:45.297 --> 01:33:46.637]  A song about Fort Dedrick, Maryland.
[01:33:51.883 --> 01:33:53.810]  See, we have bumpers about Anthrax and radio.
[01:33:53.850 --> 01:33:54.833]  This is what we look into.
[01:33:55.455 --> 01:33:56.579]  This is what we do.
[01:33:58.650 --> 01:34:19.185]  And the reason I keep interrupting Steve, and I know it's obnoxious, I can't stand it, is I get upset because I've intellectually sat here and researched this, and then he's saying it, and I'm frustrated because I'm neurotic about documenting everything I say, as he is, and I know when he talks about Project Coast, that it's been declassified on record, race-specific bioweapons to kill black people.
[01:34:19.565 --> 01:34:21.767]  I know this is mainly killing blacks, not whites.
[01:34:23.128 --> 01:34:27.271]  I know that it's clearly starting to go airborne.
[01:34:28.192 --> 01:34:32.133]  I know that I told Rolling Stone this was going to happen back in 2011 and they made fun of it.
[01:34:32.934 --> 01:34:33.534]  I know.
[01:34:33.594 --> 01:34:36.295]  So when I'm hearing him talk, I'm going, oh my gosh.
[01:34:37.455 --> 01:34:38.896]  Wayne Madsen, NSA said this.
[01:34:39.996 --> 01:34:43.297]  Steele, CIA said this.
[01:34:43.857 --> 01:34:44.698]  Robert David Steele.
[01:34:46.038 --> 01:34:47.519]  Dr. Francis Boyle said this.
[01:34:47.619 --> 01:34:49.459]  And it's not because they're just saying it.
[01:34:49.759 --> 01:34:53.921]  They're all sourcing documents as well that they would hide last week in the New York Times.
[01:34:56.061 --> 01:34:59.804]  In plain view and admit that facilities in the U.S.
[01:34:59.824 --> 01:35:05.850]  were producing the vaccine in the last few years that matches these, that's impossible.
[01:35:06.230 --> 01:35:14.057]  Because these new Ebola has randomly mutated into the cold Ebola, a cold form based Ebola, across.
[01:35:14.718 --> 01:35:16.840]  That's one out of 87 billion trillion.
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:17.581]  It's impossible.
[01:35:18.652 --> 01:35:25.477]  So you understand, they're already making vaccines years ago that are mutagens before this even ever popped up.
[01:35:26.157 --> 01:35:28.839]  And Boyle, who wrote the Bioweapons Treaty, is freaking out over it.
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:31.201]  It's so obvious, that's what's crazy.
[01:35:31.221 --> 01:35:33.582]  Now I'm going to give Steve the floor after I play this clip.
[01:35:33.883 --> 01:35:36.164]  You're just going to hear him for the rest of the hour and five minutes of the next.
[01:35:36.424 --> 01:35:39.827]  He'll be with us for two hours on Thursday, an hour of analysis, an hour of calls.
[01:35:41.482 --> 01:35:43.823]  I don't need... People say, how do you have so much energy on air?
[01:35:43.863 --> 01:35:44.724]  Well, some days I don't.
[01:35:45.044 --> 01:35:47.965]  When stuff like this is going on, I'm bouncing off the walls.
[01:35:48.325 --> 01:35:49.206]  I have three children.
[01:35:50.426 --> 01:35:51.727]  I know this stuff's going on.
[01:35:52.717 --> 01:35:56.298]  I'm in contact with people at the highest levels of that base.
[01:35:56.919 --> 01:35:57.939]  There's no quarantine.
[01:35:58.359 --> 01:35:59.179]  It's an open base.
[01:35:59.239 --> 01:36:00.980]  The families live on base and off base.
[01:36:01.180 --> 01:36:02.200]  They're wandering around everywhere.
[01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:03.881]  Troops that have been in the Ebola zone.
[01:36:03.981 --> 01:36:04.841]  It's just not true.
[01:36:05.241 --> 01:36:06.082]  We're going to be breaking that.
[01:36:06.642 --> 01:36:08.623]  It's the info overload of reality.
[01:36:08.703 --> 01:36:15.005]  I'm not watching ESPN with shortness of breath over the Seattle Seahawks and their quarterback.
[01:36:16.599 --> 01:36:19.660]  I have shortness of breath over this.
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:21.520]  That's a normal response.
[01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:25.861]  The problem is, people don't get upset anymore about things they should be upset about.
[01:36:26.101 --> 01:36:28.482]  Now, here's a clip from World War Z, and we're going to Steve Quayle.
[01:36:28.662 --> 01:36:32.262]  I'm giving him the floor to start back over, go through everything he said, and give you the latest.
[01:36:32.282 --> 01:36:34.843]  See, he was just telling me about race-specific bioweapons during the break.
[01:36:34.863 --> 01:36:42.125]  I got very upset about it because I'm just so sick of this, and it's so obvious, and it's got to stop, and it shows how bold these people are.
[01:36:42.525 --> 01:36:43.605]  Here is Brad Pitt.
[01:36:46.616 --> 01:36:47.656]  Here is Brad Pitt.
[01:36:48.657 --> 01:36:54.440]  Here is the intro to World War Z last year where they're talking about something spreading and the UN's not going to stop the flights.
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:56.340]  See how they're preconditioning you?
[01:36:56.801 --> 01:37:01.323]  Just like they show in the new Captain America all new Acuras at the Feds drive.
[01:37:01.603 --> 01:37:03.564]  And then I look, the Feds just bought a bunch of Acuras.
[01:37:04.224 --> 01:37:06.065]  It's all part of a branding rollout.
[01:37:06.105 --> 01:37:07.405]  Everything's a branding rollout.
[01:37:07.745 --> 01:37:09.026]  And you can see branding rollout.
[01:37:09.066 --> 01:37:19.370]  Just like I knew the CIA or somebody had to go to the X-Files, Chris Carter, and say, we want a government to hijack a jet and fly it in the World Trade Center, to blame Afghanistan and bring in martial law.
[01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:21.451]  We're going to use a drill to have NORAD stand down.
[01:37:21.871 --> 01:37:23.491]  That aired six months before 9-11.
[01:37:24.312 --> 01:37:27.453]  And then the X-Files star, Dean Hagelin, shows up at my door.
[01:37:29.864 --> 01:37:33.989]  And goes, you know you're right, the CIA came to us and said write that.
[01:37:36.191 --> 01:37:38.433]  That was nine months before, then it aired six months before.
[01:37:38.854 --> 01:37:40.195]  This is the world I live in.
[01:37:40.456 --> 01:37:49.946]  So I see stuff like this, and I remember being in the movie theater watching this and getting upset and saying that was subliminal, that was predictive programming, when I saw it, and then Nico reminded me of this last week.
[01:37:50.146 --> 01:37:50.627]  Here's the clip.
[01:37:51.237 --> 01:37:55.199]  Police say they've seen similar cases recently of people behaving strangely.
[01:37:55.379 --> 01:38:00.041]  The UN Health Agency is not likely to recommend official travel restrictions.
[01:38:00.101 --> 01:38:01.501]  It will be unsettling.
[01:38:01.861 --> 01:38:03.022]  They're not physicists.
[01:38:03.062 --> 01:38:04.062]  They're not engineers.
[01:38:04.383 --> 01:38:05.863]  They think it's just gonna go away.
[01:38:05.903 --> 01:38:07.384]  They live in a fantasy parallel universe.
[01:38:19.410 --> 01:38:28.072]  Okay, so, and the film's all about overpopulation, that's why, and the book says it's a good thing that the zombies came to destroy the American gun owners.
[01:38:28.472 --> 01:38:40.695]  And we just found a Rockefeller document that McHale is on, that's public, three years ago saying they would use Ebola, and it shows it emanating in the graph out of Africa, to bring in tyranny.
[01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:43.261]  To basically bring in a police state.
[01:38:43.701 --> 01:38:45.903]  So, I give the floor now to Steve Quayle.
[01:38:46.443 --> 01:38:48.725]  The problem is there's just so much data, Steve.
[01:38:49.625 --> 01:38:50.226]  Break it down.
[01:38:50.326 --> 01:38:50.766]  What is it?
[01:38:50.806 --> 01:38:51.646]  Where is it coming from?
[01:38:51.707 --> 01:38:52.427]  What's the latest?
[01:38:53.528 --> 01:38:55.189]  What do you think is going to happen next, Steve Quayle?
[01:38:55.936 --> 01:39:00.399]  Okay Alex, first of all, most people are dealing with the fruit of evil and not going to the root of evil.
[01:39:00.639 --> 01:39:02.821]  The root of evil is this is a biological weapon.
[01:39:03.221 --> 01:39:12.027]  It has concurrent with the various forms that are patented by the CDC, its corresponding supposed vaccines that are also patented.
[01:39:12.407 --> 01:39:26.167]  But taking everyone back to the start of it, in the late 70s, 1970s, South Africa, under the direction of Wouter Basson, B-A-S-S-O-N, and Operation Coast, began work on race-specific bioweapons.
[01:39:26.287 --> 01:39:28.210]  It's really critical people understand that.
[01:39:29.025 --> 01:39:38.193]  It pretty much pioneered, if you could find any genetic marker, you could basically build a bioweapon directed at that genetic marker.
[01:39:38.634 --> 01:39:50.384]  This is why in 1976, in Africa, they achieved with an Ebola, a true hemorrhagic fever weapon, almost a 90% death rate.
[01:39:50.404 --> 01:39:51.285]  Now interesting, Alex,
[01:39:51.625 --> 01:39:58.748]  That corresponds with the globalist's own statements, which you've repeated on for as long as you've been on the air, how many people they want to kill.
[01:39:58.928 --> 01:40:19.117]  This is why they are bringing the, I'll say it bluntly, the white people back, and even, you know, they're living, and these are people that have genuinely been exposed to the Ebola variant, or let's call it this, the false Ebola disease, okay?
[01:40:19.838 --> 01:40:23.361]  The problem that people cannot relate to, and this is it!
[01:40:23.901 --> 01:40:29.446]  They cannot believe that there is a sinister, wicked, supernatural evil.
[01:40:29.806 --> 01:40:31.307]  These people are Satanists.
[01:40:31.347 --> 01:40:32.528]  They hate human life.
[01:40:32.868 --> 01:40:34.890]  That's the whole basis of transhumanism.
[01:40:34.970 --> 01:40:36.411]  By the way, Alex, let me say this.
[01:40:36.751 --> 01:40:41.475]  When I wrote the book Breathe No Evil, and I was on your show back then, you announced it at the beginning of the stage.
[01:40:41.995 --> 01:40:43.316]  I will not reprint that book.
[01:40:43.336 --> 01:40:46.137]  I'm down to the last 80 or 100 copies of that.
[01:40:46.537 --> 01:40:49.158]  And when my books go out of print, they go on Amazon.
[01:40:49.678 --> 01:40:50.758]  I'm astounded.
[01:40:51.139 --> 01:40:52.779]  On Amazon for $300 and $400.
[01:40:53.219 --> 01:41:02.683]  So, ladies and gentlemen, I'm telling you, Breathe No Evil laid out the plans of the chemical and biological weapons.
[01:41:02.803 --> 01:41:11.026]  Even the gentleman you talked about on the Chemical and Biological Weapons Treaty, everybody and their dog was skirting it, including the United States.
[01:41:11.386 --> 01:41:13.407]  Let's jump immediately to vaccines.
[01:41:13.828 --> 01:41:26.316]  If nothing that has been spoken of by the Center for Disease Creation has been true, then what makes anybody believe that the vaccines will not have a timed
[01:41:27.516 --> 01:41:34.420]  Release of a, let's say, encapsulated or a secondary pathogen that is in an envelope.
[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:39.163]  When I wrote Breathe No Evil, I said the plans were even to poison the U.S.
[01:41:39.223 --> 01:41:47.327]  mail by using the glue on stamps or the glue on the envelope sealant as a growing medium for whatever biological weapon.
[01:41:47.347 --> 01:41:54.911]  You remember, Alex, that people were checking the mails, they were putting their mail in packages, even through scanners.
[01:41:55.231 --> 01:41:55.311]  Yes.
[01:42:16.144 --> 01:42:21.646]  They were either clued in, bought off, or guaranteed that this was going to break out.
[01:42:21.686 --> 01:42:27.427]  So what most people don't realize is the race war is something the New World Order wants.
[01:42:28.448 --> 01:42:34.269]  Our blacklisters don't want it, people of good faith, I don't want it, nobody wants it, but they want it, okay?
[01:42:34.709 --> 01:42:36.370]  So how does this tie in?
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:38.681]  This ties in at some point.
[01:42:38.761 --> 01:42:47.828]  They will officially release, or be forced to release, that this was, there is, in all of its forms and variants, a race-specific bioweapon.
[01:42:48.328 --> 01:42:50.950]  When that comes out, you know what's going to hit the fan.
[01:42:50.990 --> 01:42:56.654]  By the way, I believe Louis Farrakhan's already made, I'm not endorsing him, I'm just saying he's already drawing that conclusion.
[01:42:57.294 --> 01:43:07.579]  So, as they have been able to identify specific markers in the genetic code of specific races, look, they could do it against blue-eyed blondes if they wanted to.
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:14.123]  Let everyone understand that when they see these events taking place, whether it's Ebola,
[01:43:15.063 --> 01:43:21.927]  Scientists being killed in the aircraft over Ukraine, whether it's my dead scientist.
[01:43:21.987 --> 01:43:36.796]  One of the most important things, Alex, is one of the dead scientists, I think he's number 54 or 57, you have to go on my website and check out him, the guy had developed the universal, listen to this, the universal antidote to all viruses.
[01:43:37.236 --> 01:43:40.298]  Well sure they'd want to whack him, and can I be blunt?
[01:43:40.738 --> 01:43:51.545]  The greatest disconnect, I think, of people is when I get emails from them saying, well, why are all these scientists being killed, or molecular biologists, or the lead scientists, virologists, biological weapons experts?
[01:43:51.745 --> 01:43:52.526]  Real simple.
[01:43:52.946 --> 01:44:03.413]  They don't want anybody existing out of their control that can develop a functioning vaccine, or also let the cat out of the bag.
[01:44:03.673 --> 01:44:06.515]  If you're going to destroy 90% of the world, now that's not
[01:44:06.735 --> 01:44:11.816]  That's not fear-mongering, that's not doom porn, that is a specific stated desire of theirs.
[01:44:11.836 --> 01:44:17.337]  So here's the deal, you know, don't confuse me with facts as the average critic of yours and mine.
[01:44:17.697 --> 01:44:18.837]  Our minds are made up.
[01:44:19.338 --> 01:44:24.959]  What they have to understand is they haven't paid the price to basically go and research us.
[01:44:24.999 --> 01:44:27.139]  They don't have the connections you have or I have.
[01:44:27.539 --> 01:44:31.060]  I have, I have a CIA, he's dead now, top agent.
[01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:32.001]  We're good to go.
[01:44:50.092 --> 01:44:58.117]  Because, ultimately, what happens is that the only thing they can use to pretty much contain it is a fuel-air explosive.
[01:44:58.437 --> 01:44:59.818]  Donald Sutherland's character.
[01:44:59.898 --> 01:45:01.319]  Now, why is this predictive?
[01:45:01.339 --> 01:45:08.864]  You just shared, obviously, that the gentleman, what was his name, the movie star that came to you and knocked on your door and said the CIA told us to write it?
[01:45:09.304 --> 01:45:09.985]  That was Dean Hagelin.
[01:45:10.478 --> 01:45:10.658]  Yeah.
[01:45:11.059 --> 01:45:14.701]  And so when Dean Hagelin tells you that, do you think people don't get it?
[01:45:15.102 --> 01:45:19.645]  Now, I want to tell you where we're headed, because I think we're running out of time until we get next week.
[01:45:20.066 --> 01:45:21.907]  The point, or I'm sorry, on Thursday.
[01:45:22.227 --> 01:45:27.712]  The point is, is we're only talking now about that which most people believe.
[01:45:28.132 --> 01:45:32.456]  I'm calling it substance X, whether it's Ebola pox, mouse pox.
[01:45:32.496 --> 01:45:34.617]  You remember when the story broke on mouse pox?
[01:45:35.018 --> 01:45:39.081]  That formula was actually put up on the Internet.
[01:45:40.051 --> 01:45:43.613]  And to the FBI's credit, they tried to stop the other areas of the U.S.
[01:45:43.653 --> 01:45:51.477]  government and the Australian government publishing, and for those that don't know, mouse pox in humans kills 98% and is airborne.
[01:45:52.297 --> 01:45:52.797]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:53.218 --> 01:45:59.261]  So the idea that this is, quote, aerosolized or airborne, that's a given, okay?
[01:45:59.541 --> 01:46:00.941]  Here's the maxim, okay?
[01:46:01.542 --> 01:46:05.744]  All biological weapons are meant to be dispersed by air.
[01:46:06.631 --> 01:46:08.092]  All biological weapons.
[01:46:08.132 --> 01:46:12.755]  Here's something that you won't hear anybody else talk about and I've been talking about it for years.
[01:46:12.775 --> 01:46:23.802]  20 years ago, they proved the electromagnetic attenuation of even the simplest viruses and the simplest bacteria could be turned into super viruses and super bacteria.
[01:46:23.822 --> 01:46:29.005]  Do you remember when the Moscow embassy was being bombarded with microwave radiation?
[01:46:29.065 --> 01:46:30.546]  Everybody was coming down with cancer?
[01:46:30.586 --> 01:46:30.666]  Yes.
[01:46:31.486 --> 01:46:37.891]  Imagine that on a given scale with you've got something that's 70% effective in the kill ratio.
[01:46:37.911 --> 01:46:49.359]  By the way, the latest report is this Ebola fake variant of a true filovirus has only got about a 50 to 54% lethal kill rate.
[01:46:49.419 --> 01:46:50.940]  That's still super deadly.
[01:46:51.380 --> 01:46:53.001]  Let me expand on this though briefly.
[01:46:53.182 --> 01:46:56.024]  You were the first, just true folks, no brag, just fact,
[01:46:56.784 --> 01:47:08.595]  To talk about microbiologists back when it was like 20 or something and you said they're wiping out all the top people and it was everybody over Ebola or over smallpox getting run over by vans in Houston and backed back over being shot, being tortured.
[01:47:09.576 --> 01:47:11.778]  A whole bunch of them were sacrificed.
[01:47:11.838 --> 01:47:13.760]  This sounds insane, but police know about it.
[01:47:14.261 --> 01:47:20.547]  In Virginia and other areas, they would go in and the cops would find the microbiologists with bloody pentagrams with their guts cut out.
[01:47:20.567 --> 01:47:21.367]  Remember that, Steve?
[01:47:22.088 --> 01:47:22.248]  Yeah.
[01:47:39.045 --> 01:47:41.007]  And my gut has never been more concerned.
[01:47:41.407 --> 01:47:43.930]  What do you think the big endgame is in this?
[01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:46.152]  Are they covering it up till after the election?
[01:47:46.532 --> 01:47:48.154]  Is Substance X going to get worse?
[01:47:48.554 --> 01:47:50.897]  Is this just a cover like it's hitting us here as well?
[01:47:51.197 --> 01:47:54.421]  It's about to wipe out, you know, a third of Africa like AIDS did?
[01:47:55.041 --> 01:47:55.622]  What's happening?
[01:47:56.169 --> 01:47:59.694]  Well, first of all, they're not going to be happy with a third of Africa.
[01:48:00.054 --> 01:48:03.258]  They're going to be happy with 90% of Africa, okay?
[01:48:03.559 --> 01:48:10.969]  They're not going to be... What's going to happen in the United States, we'll leave Africa for another date, because again, you know, that's the test tube
[01:48:11.369 --> 01:48:14.611]  Of all bioweapons efficacy is Africa.
[01:48:14.991 --> 01:48:19.913]  Going to the United States, what they're going to do is they're going to have selective breakouts in selective cities.
[01:48:20.333 --> 01:48:22.834]  They're going to control the flow of information.
[01:48:23.074 --> 01:48:28.817]  And again, Alex, with no independent verification, that they're going to bring city after city under martial law.
[01:48:28.837 --> 01:48:33.219]  First of all, they want to check the effectiveness of the bioweapon.
[01:48:33.499 --> 01:48:36.220]  They want to control the mayhem.
[01:48:36.681 --> 01:48:39.082]  Obviously, not everyone's going to go walk to
[01:48:39.822 --> 01:48:44.305]  Lying central, international, downtown Chicago, New York, Dallas, wherever.
[01:48:44.625 --> 01:48:48.427]  And I want the people of Texas to figure this out really simply.
[01:48:48.927 --> 01:48:51.449]  War has been declared on Texas.
[01:48:52.049 --> 01:49:03.875]  It's the chemtrails, the droughts that have come under when your governor met with the administration, the mockery of Governor Perry, and the attack upon Dallas.
[01:49:03.915 --> 01:49:04.836]  Where was the first place?
[01:49:05.016 --> 01:49:05.836]  Obviously Ebola.
[01:49:06.097 --> 01:49:07.097]  Obviously Texas.
[01:49:07.617 --> 01:49:08.158]  It's two
[01:49:09.159 --> 01:49:09.779]  How do I say this?
[01:49:09.879 --> 01:49:19.229]  It's too in your face for even the largest or the most prominent skeptic to deny that Texas has been under attack.
[01:49:19.309 --> 01:49:21.491]  Both weather wars and again chemtrails.
[01:49:21.551 --> 01:49:23.253]  Remember this, chemtrails
[01:49:24.073 --> 01:49:27.597]  Are an atmospheric Petri dish or Petri dish.
[01:49:28.057 --> 01:49:29.239]  So what's going to happen Alex?
[01:49:29.519 --> 01:49:31.381]  They want martial law.
[01:49:31.661 --> 01:49:33.864]  They want forced vaccination.
[01:49:34.144 --> 01:49:36.406]  They're going to make a case to the public.
[01:49:36.447 --> 01:49:44.916]  We have to lock up those crazy conspiracy theorists because if people believe them, well then they won't get the vaccination which will save the greater good.
[01:49:45.436 --> 01:49:47.457]  Anybody who tells the truth will be vilified.
[01:49:47.837 --> 01:49:50.798]  Ultimately, they'll be nullified and destroyed, okay?
[01:49:50.938 --> 01:49:51.978]  Outside the grace of God.
[01:49:52.298 --> 01:49:54.459]  Now, I believe people need to understand this.
[01:49:54.719 --> 01:50:04.241]  There is truly the covering grace of a living God, Psalm 91, and that is what I stake my faith on, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[01:50:04.281 --> 01:50:09.743]  That is why, I guess, you know, I'm one of the guys sounding the greatest alarm, because I'm about saving lives, Alex.
[01:50:09.783 --> 01:50:10.223]  So are you!
[01:50:10.843 --> 01:50:12.626]  But there comes a frustration.
[01:50:13.006 --> 01:50:14.508]  You come to it and I come to it.
[01:50:14.528 --> 01:50:19.735]  When I sit at the phone or you sit at the radio, Mike, and I say to the Lord, I say, what's the use, Lord?
[01:50:20.256 --> 01:50:21.097]  What's the use?
[01:50:21.197 --> 01:50:26.464]  How do I stop these malevolent, evil creatures that are consuming
[01:50:27.017 --> 01:50:29.698]  They admit they created airborne Ebola to kill black people.
[01:50:29.938 --> 01:50:31.678]  They admit they created HIV.
[01:50:31.798 --> 01:50:32.978]  People always say, show me the document.
[01:50:33.218 --> 01:50:34.558]  It's declassified in Africa.
[01:50:34.798 --> 01:50:36.559]  It's declassified in the UN reports.
[01:50:36.759 --> 01:50:38.259]  They caught them sterilizing African women.
[01:50:38.319 --> 01:50:39.159]  Look it up, folks!
[01:50:39.599 --> 01:50:41.120]  We can play the BBC clip again.
[01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:43.540]  And then they have Rolling Stone making fun of us.
[01:50:43.860 --> 01:50:44.440]  Oh, ha!
[01:50:44.780 --> 01:50:46.481]  He thinks the government's making airborne Ebola.
[01:50:47.321 --> 01:50:51.542]  Well, again, Rolling Stone or whoever can make fun of us, but they can't.
[01:50:51.602 --> 01:50:53.782]  See, all they can do is attack the messenger.
[01:50:54.543 --> 01:50:59.566]  Well, what are they gonna do when they get a vaccine and their kid gets brain damaged or when they get mousepox?
[01:51:00.026 --> 01:51:03.928]  I mean, the globalists say they're gonna bring in world government, release bioweapons and wipe us out.
[01:51:04.108 --> 01:51:06.810]  They're gonna do tests first, and I think this is a big test.
[01:51:06.870 --> 01:51:08.571]  We'll come back with Steve Coyle.
[01:51:10.051 --> 01:51:12.972]  This hour brought to you by InfidelBodyArmor.com.

[01:51:40.303 --> 01:51:41.063]  Hey, Boomer!
[01:51:41.303 --> 01:51:44.626]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[01:51:44.746 --> 01:51:46.327]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[01:51:46.427 --> 01:51:48.168]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[01:51:48.369 --> 01:51:53.873]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[01:51:54.213 --> 01:51:54.953]  I know, right?
[01:51:55.034 --> 01:51:55.974]  You love it, too!
[01:51:56.354 --> 01:51:57.655]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[01:51:57.796 --> 01:51:58.696]  Let's go get some!

[01:52:09.255 --> 01:52:13.596]  On September 30th, 2014, the first confirmed case of Ebola appeared in the U.S.
[01:52:13.916 --> 01:52:25.919]  This combined with several other unidentified viruses have some of our customers at 30dayfoodsupply.com concerned about the safety of our domestic food supply, resulting in a surge of our $99.90 serving kits.
[01:52:26.259 --> 01:52:36.222]  While we at 30dayfoodsupply.com have no expertise in epidemiology, we are aggressively purchasing raw materials that are currently in stock and we intend to continue to sell

[01:53:04.785 --> 01:53:05.785]  541-229-0010.
[01:53:06.185 --> 01:53:09.967]  Your house is dark.
[01:53:10.307 --> 01:53:10.747]  Vacant.
[01:53:10.987 --> 01:53:13.348]  You must be gone on vacation for a while.
[01:53:13.368 --> 01:53:14.849]  Thanks for all the jewelry.
[01:53:15.469 --> 01:53:17.490]  Don't be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:53:17.550 --> 01:53:25.893]  Go to faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone is inside watching TV and makes your home unappealing to would-be thieves.

[01:53:42.849 --> 01:53:45.629]  Gear up while you still can with Infidel Body Armor.
[01:53:45.789 --> 01:53:47.429]  Don't spend between $500 and $600.
[01:53:48.049 --> 01:53:52.710]  Infidel is available for just $374.99 with free shipping within the U.S.
[01:53:52.950 --> 01:53:55.271]  Made in America and legal in all 50 states.

[01:54:00.912 --> 01:54:03.932]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:54:17.319 --> 01:54:18.500]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:19.640]  Steve Quayle is here.
[01:54:19.660 --> 01:54:39.291]  If you know about the hundreds of thousands of nuclear weapons that have been produced, if you know about the 36 level 4 bioweapons labs producing stuff that makes airborne Ebola look tame, if you know about this, you'd have to be insane to trust the system with its long history of secret experimentation, you name it.
[01:54:39.731 --> 01:54:41.972]  And they don't just do it to the poor black folks, they do it to everybody.
[01:54:43.173 --> 01:54:45.314]  But Africa is the big testing ground.
[01:54:46.311 --> 01:54:48.753]  But because it's the government, it's seen as okay.
[01:54:50.835 --> 01:54:53.397]  And this will end up crushing a lot of people that work in the government.
[01:54:53.577 --> 01:55:00.062]  The good news is, a lot of nurses, the military, the police, you name it, every cop I know would never take a vaccine.
[01:55:01.103 --> 01:55:08.168]  And it's just time to understand that it's not that the science of vaccines aren't real, it's that we can't trust these people to give us their vaccines.
[01:55:09.729 --> 01:55:13.392]  They knew 20 years ago that BT corn was causing gut problems.
[01:55:13.873 --> 01:55:15.374]  And now there's big studies out on it today.
[01:55:17.011 --> 01:55:18.654]  Farmers don't have to feed their pigs, it kills them.
[01:55:18.674 --> 01:55:20.176]  There's a study out on that this week.
[01:55:21.679 --> 01:55:26.707]  Visit stevequell.com, you can find some of his books that are about to be out of print, like Breathe No Evil.
[01:55:28.149 --> 01:55:32.832]  And XenoGenesis, SteveQuell.com, a very fascinating website, covers it all.
[01:55:33.772 --> 01:55:35.213]  Very, very interesting information.
[01:55:36.054 --> 01:55:43.438]  Briefly, don't forget that we carry the highest quality colloidal silver, the highest quality nascent iodine X2 that is selling out.
[01:55:43.979 --> 01:55:45.399]  So you probably want to get some of that.
[01:55:45.740 --> 01:55:47.060]  Supports the broadcast as well.
[01:55:47.141 --> 01:55:49.662]  DNA Force, which is a true nutraceutical.
[01:55:49.822 --> 01:55:51.343]  OxyPower to flush out the gut.
[01:55:51.363 --> 01:55:53.264]  70% of your immune system is in the gut.
[01:55:53.284 --> 01:55:54.065]  That's why they target it.
[01:55:54.405 --> 01:55:55.686]  Hence the corn, the rest of it.
[01:55:56.226 --> 01:56:05.032]  When you come face-to-face with the fact that Bill Gates is a eugenicist and admits it, and that, you know, he's running Monsanto and the food, it's just mind-blowing.
[01:56:05.172 --> 01:56:09.555]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:56:09.675 --> 01:56:11.957]  They can answer your questions.
[01:56:12.377 --> 01:56:13.278]  And we're still running.
[01:56:13.298 --> 01:56:14.238]  I haven't been plugging this.
[01:56:14.298 --> 01:56:14.599]  I should.
[01:56:15.879 --> 01:56:19.020]  Uh, 5% off already all the discounts on Infowarslife.com.
[01:56:19.780 --> 01:56:23.121]  All the supplements and things there with promo code N-O-W.
[01:56:23.141 --> 01:56:25.342]  So 5% off the promo code now.
[01:56:25.862 --> 01:56:27.703]  Uh, Steve, we got about three, four minutes left till break.
[01:56:27.783 --> 01:56:28.363]  One more segment.
[01:56:28.383 --> 01:56:32.364]  You'll be back Thursday for two hours to get into true detail on all this and take calls, but...
[01:56:34.246 --> 01:56:35.846]  They are trying to get it to spread.
[01:56:35.886 --> 01:56:37.347]  They are covering it up until the election.
[01:56:37.387 --> 01:56:38.867]  They do want to set the medical tyranny.
[01:56:39.187 --> 01:56:45.429]  Obama did sign that executive order, unprecedented, to secretly quarantine anybody who shows any signs of representative illness.
[01:56:45.749 --> 01:56:48.089]  That's what they're using to snatch folks out of the hospitals.
[01:56:48.789 --> 01:56:53.650]  If we go along with this current beta test, they will roll out phase two of this.
[01:56:53.951 --> 01:56:54.811]  They're scientists.
[01:56:54.931 --> 01:56:55.331]  They are
[01:56:55.891 --> 01:56:56.952]  They are mad scientists.
[01:56:57.013 --> 01:56:58.615]  Everything they do is done scientifically.
[01:56:58.895 --> 01:57:00.577]  So yes, you can see the rollout.
[01:57:00.857 --> 01:57:02.399]  How is the rollout going for them?
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:05.624]  Because I think if we put enough heat on them, they may be forced to back off.
[01:57:06.789 --> 01:57:09.430]  Well, that's the point in trying to expose darkness.
[01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:13.512]  The littlest of light will cause the deepest darkness to flee.
[01:57:13.912 --> 01:57:16.714]  And that's why you do what you do, and I do what I do.
[01:57:17.134 --> 01:57:18.174]  Alex, here's the deal.
[01:57:18.735 --> 01:57:25.038]  When I was given the red list, the blue list, and the green list, and remember how many people said, oh, that doesn't sound right.
[01:57:25.078 --> 01:57:27.099]  The government's not keeping a list of people to kill.
[01:57:27.259 --> 01:57:28.259]  Oh, yes, they are.
[01:57:28.659 --> 01:57:29.780]  And oh, yes, they have.
[01:57:30.626 --> 01:57:32.967]  It was given to me by a guy whose first name was Gary.
[01:57:32.987 --> 01:57:36.788]  He was head of the Environmental Protection Agency over the Western United States.
[01:57:37.489 --> 01:57:41.931]  He told me about the list, and again, I'll run through it really quickly if I may.
[01:57:42.251 --> 01:57:49.233]  The red lists are gun owners, constitutionalists, Christians, people that absolutely believe in an absolute.
[01:57:49.253 --> 01:57:50.394]  They believe in right or wrong.
[01:57:51.034 --> 01:57:51.134]  Yes.
[01:58:19.898 --> 01:58:21.500]  That's not for toxic waste.
[01:58:21.880 --> 01:58:23.441]  That's for the millions.
[01:58:23.481 --> 01:58:23.982]  Here's the word.
[01:58:24.002 --> 01:58:25.523]  Now understand he got murdered, Alex.
[01:58:26.284 --> 01:58:29.006]  The millions of corpses they're going to deal with.
[01:58:29.047 --> 01:58:30.228]  Now we've seen the coffins.
[01:58:30.288 --> 01:58:31.769]  We've seen the mass burial sites.
[01:58:32.189 --> 01:58:35.593]  But that's all window dressing, so to speak.
[01:58:36.013 --> 01:58:38.996]  That's for areas that may be away from the incinerators.
[01:58:39.036 --> 01:58:41.158]  He also told me an amazing fact.
[01:58:41.658 --> 01:58:44.501]  I've only, I think, broached the subject twice in my life.
[01:58:46.448 --> 01:58:46.889]  Stay there.
[01:58:46.909 --> 01:58:48.211]  We're back in one minute with that.
[01:58:48.612 --> 01:58:49.373]  That key intel.
[01:58:49.654 --> 01:58:50.615]  Steve Quill, 3rd Hour.
[01:58:50.635 --> 01:58:51.677]  Don't forget to family tune in.
[01:58:51.938 --> 01:58:53.881]  He'll be here Thursday for two hours.
[01:58:54.021 --> 01:58:56.566]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:59.972 --> 01:59:10.180]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:59:10.520 --> 01:59:16.604]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:59:16.985 --> 01:59:19.226]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:59:19.326 --> 01:59:22.389]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[01:59:22.409 --> 01:59:29.274]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[01:59:29.747 --> 01:59:33.248]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:59:33.408 --> 01:59:37.369]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:59:37.689 --> 01:59:39.149]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:59:39.469 --> 01:59:47.051]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:59:47.311 --> 01:59:48.172]  But for how long?
[01:59:48.452 --> 01:59:54.713]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:59:55.093 --> 01:59:57.914]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:00:01.937 --> 02:00:04.542]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:15.822 --> 02:00:19.965]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:20.645 --> 02:00:21.446]  You want answers?
[02:00:22.227 --> 02:00:23.327]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.788 --> 02:00:26.149]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:26.169 --> 02:00:28.511]  Let's go right in to Steve Quayle in the time we have left.
[02:00:28.551 --> 02:00:30.893]  Steve, during the breaks, you're just dropping incredible info on me.
[02:00:31.773 --> 02:00:39.198]  Finish up that key term you didn't get to, then what the nurses and doctors are telling you, the intel you're getting, and then getting our hearts right with God.
[02:00:39.238 --> 02:00:39.939]  Go ahead, Steve Quayle.
[02:00:40.572 --> 02:00:44.775]  First of all, you know, getting our hearts right with God is the very first important thing.
[02:00:45.575 --> 02:00:49.118]  You know, God's word is His people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.
[02:00:49.498 --> 02:00:58.024]  The people in the pulpits better understand, I'm talking about the preachers, they better start speaking the truth and standing up for the truth, or basically they become vomited out of Jesus' mouth.
[02:00:58.064 --> 02:00:58.904]  That's Revelation 3.16.
[02:01:10.832 --> 02:01:13.577]  And by the way, they now admit that they have those lists.
[02:01:14.118 --> 02:01:15.040]  They have those lists.
[02:01:15.461 --> 02:01:23.756]  He talked about curative process, and here's what I want to warn every doctor, every nurse, and every healthcare provider.
[02:01:24.891 --> 02:01:29.333]  He absolutely blew my mind then, and it still breaks my heart now, okay?
[02:01:29.894 --> 02:01:36.116]  But their goal is to take away the healthcare system to maximize the kill rate.
[02:01:36.657 --> 02:01:47.462]  And so that's, Alex, in my opinion, why the Center for Disease Creation is not being frank, is not being blunt, and lawyers become the first ones that get killed.
[02:01:48.642 --> 02:01:49.783]  That's what's going on.
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:52.920]  I'm just speechless.
[02:01:54.161 --> 02:01:56.642]  What should we call this video when we put it up on YouTube?
[02:01:57.682 --> 02:02:01.844]  Just like, Insider reveals the stunning secrets of Ebola?
[02:02:02.404 --> 02:02:03.444]  Yep.
[02:02:03.584 --> 02:02:10.767]  Or basically, the end game is, you know, you always talk about... Ebola is the end game.
[02:02:11.493 --> 02:02:18.418]  The end game, and you've talked about it, but see, the disconnect in all of us who have warned is that it's happening now.
[02:02:18.658 --> 02:02:19.979]  This isn't future tense.
[02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:25.904]  All of the breakouts that will be seen throughout the country, those are tests.
[02:02:25.964 --> 02:02:39.714]  The test, number one, the virulency of the virus and any possible antibodies, and anybody who's got an antibody that, in effect, if anybody who survives because of the immune system, they will become an enemy because if someone
[02:02:40.214 --> 02:02:40.394]  Yes.
[02:02:55.251 --> 02:03:00.095]  On a true BSL-4 level, you'll see the military out in full garb.
[02:03:00.136 --> 02:03:05.360]  They won't just be dressed in a respirator, a face mask, and yellow or white Tyvek.
[02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:06.541]  That's your giveaway.
[02:03:06.601 --> 02:03:11.185]  This is not a true Marburg or a true hemorrhagic fever.
[02:03:11.586 --> 02:03:22.075]  CCH, Crimean hemorrhagic, what is it, CHF, Crimean hemorrhagic fever and all that, that is all of the worst nightmares, including polio.
[02:03:22.495 --> 02:03:29.158]  And you know this, the United States government wouldn't believe that the Soviet Union developed a combination, if you will, Ebola-polio.
[02:03:29.498 --> 02:03:34.120]  So this EV68, let me just share this with everybody, that's striking young people.
[02:03:34.161 --> 02:03:42.965]  Does it strike anybody, pun intended, that is aimed at a specific age group and that there's so much paralysis associated with it?
[02:03:44.085 --> 02:03:49.490]  People are monsters, and there has got to be an awareness.
[02:03:49.710 --> 02:03:53.934]  And if the pulpits buy the lie, the people die.
[02:03:53.954 --> 02:04:00.960]  Well, the mystery illnesses that wiped out people, including three of my family members, last year and this year, the doctors said they've never seen anything like it.
[02:04:01.281 --> 02:04:02.281]  People are dying everywhere.
[02:04:02.562 --> 02:04:08.147]  But see, the real stuff they cover up, Steve, you told me you're being bombarded by medical professionals confirming the disappearances.
[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:10.440]  Yes, sir.
[02:04:10.820 --> 02:04:26.805]  And not only that, Alex, the bottom line is virologists and scientists, and I'm talking about guys that have enough PhDs and enough letters of science behind their name, they'd make a thermometer jealous, okay?
[02:04:27.525 --> 02:04:30.586]  And so, this is life and death, okay?
[02:04:31.486 --> 02:04:32.946]  And I talked to Alex off the air.
[02:04:32.966 --> 02:04:38.128]  I said, Alex, I wish people would at least have the intellectual integrity to go and
[02:04:43.392 --> 02:04:44.193]  We're out of time.
[02:04:44.313 --> 02:04:45.634]  You gotta do it Thursday.
[02:04:47.555 --> 02:04:49.176]  Promise me you'll be back Thursday for two hours.
[02:04:51.819 --> 02:04:53.240]  Steve Quayle dot com.
[02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:54.421]  Find it all there.
[02:04:54.441 --> 02:04:55.441]  Steve Quayle dot com.
[02:04:55.642 --> 02:04:56.162]  Thank you, Steve.
[02:04:56.182 --> 02:04:58.083]  We'll see you on Thursday for two hours, okay?
[02:04:58.504 --> 02:05:00.685]  Hey, tell me during the break what it is.
[02:05:00.725 --> 02:05:02.247]  I gotta come back and tell them at least.
[02:05:02.487 --> 02:05:03.368]  I'll tell them at the end of the show.
[02:05:03.388 --> 02:05:04.308]  There's another guest coming up.
[02:05:04.749 --> 02:05:05.809]  I'm gonna come right back.
[02:05:05.829 --> 02:05:06.330]  Hold on a second.
[02:05:10.373 --> 02:05:20.476]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[02:05:20.937 --> 02:05:27.039]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:05:27.399 --> 02:05:29.640]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:05:29.740 --> 02:05:32.801]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[02:05:32.841 --> 02:05:39.703]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[02:05:40.171 --> 02:05:43.672]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:05:43.832 --> 02:05:47.793]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:48.113 --> 02:05:49.573]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:05:49.893 --> 02:05:57.475]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:05:57.755 --> 02:05:58.595]  But for how long?
[02:05:58.895 --> 02:06:05.156]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:06:05.536 --> 02:06:08.337]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:06:09.790 --> 02:06:10.791]  The experts are clear.
[02:06:11.111 --> 02:06:18.097]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[02:06:18.237 --> 02:06:24.503]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:24.523 --> 02:06:28.106]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[02:06:28.226 --> 02:06:32.127]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[02:06:32.447 --> 02:06:37.488]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:06:37.748 --> 02:06:38.668]  Not our iodine.
[02:06:38.768 --> 02:06:42.349]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[02:06:42.569 --> 02:06:44.909]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[02:07:13.782 --> 02:07:21.992]  I have set out to bring you the most hardcore cutting-edge supplements and nutraceuticals bar none and that's what you'll find at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:22.172 --> 02:07:29.241]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[02:07:29.321 --> 02:07:29.982]  We're good.
[02:07:49.401 --> 02:07:59.867]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com and believed in us and tried the products.
[02:08:00.227 --> 02:08:07.831]  Folks, check out Infowarslife.com today and the entire line of groundbreaking, cutting-edge, hardcore products.
[02:08:26.474 --> 02:08:30.396]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:31.997 --> 02:08:36.720]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:41.143 --> 02:08:48.767]  We had him on last week for about 20 minutes, and I wanted to get him on for a full hour today, because this film is so important.
[02:08:48.787 --> 02:08:54.310]  I know that as libertarians or constitutionalists or liberty lovers, we understand that collectivism is slavery.
[02:08:54.370 --> 02:08:55.591]  It's a high-tech name for slavery.
[02:08:57.310 --> 02:09:07.053]  And that progressivism is just the current name of the scientific dictatorship or the compartmentalization of this kleptocratic society.
[02:09:07.953 --> 02:09:14.595]  But he has produced a new film that we are the exclusive distributor of on DVD until December 2nd.
[02:09:16.636 --> 02:09:22.498]  And I wanted to get him on for radio and TV listeners so that we could
[02:09:24.707 --> 02:09:28.474]  Go through his film and actually play a lot of excerpts from it.
[02:09:28.494 --> 02:09:32.901]  So this will kind of be a documentary this next 50 so minutes here on air.
[02:09:35.253 --> 02:09:40.999]  We know that the progressive idea of history is a step-by-step progress to achieve what they believe is utopia.
[02:09:41.379 --> 02:09:42.981]  You hear that from the communists as well.
[02:09:43.501 --> 02:09:48.526]  Mao Zedong killed 80 plus million people in his cultural revolution and great leap forward.
[02:09:48.546 --> 02:09:52.530]  The one-child policy was a utopian system.
[02:09:53.291 --> 02:09:55.533]  It creates nightmares, the zeitgeist movement.
[02:09:55.573 --> 02:09:56.213]  I'm not attacking
[02:09:57.034 --> 02:10:03.235]  All aspects of it, but the overall, you're living in a plastic city and a big dome and a computer will tell you what you eat and what you do.
[02:10:03.635 --> 02:10:16.718]  That's what the British government's teaching kids right now with a video series, cartoons, called Megapolis, where you're told where you go, you're told what you do, your cars are all remote control, you're not allowed to drive your car.
[02:10:17.098 --> 02:10:21.399]  Time Magazine says that the goal in ten years should be no drivers driving cars.
[02:10:22.768 --> 02:10:32.792]  They are trying to mold the future as if they are the people that discovered fire, or harnessed fire, or discovered the wheel, that all innovation is from them.
[02:10:32.913 --> 02:10:40.436]  And notice, I'm going to play this clip later, Hillary over the weekend said, businesses don't create jobs.
[02:10:40.576 --> 02:10:41.997]  She goes, we know that's not true now.
[02:10:42.837 --> 02:10:44.458]  Just like they say two plus two equals five.
[02:10:44.498 --> 02:10:45.378]  You're like, that's crazy.
[02:10:46.018 --> 02:10:47.419]  They have to overthrow reality.
[02:10:49.022 --> 02:10:50.983]  That's a French Revolution system.
[02:10:51.003 --> 02:10:52.865]  It wasn't a revolution for people.
[02:10:52.885 --> 02:10:54.506]  It was a revolution of oppression and tyranny.
[02:10:55.186 --> 02:10:55.987]  It was the Jacobins.
[02:10:56.747 --> 02:10:58.208]  That's what we're basically under today.
[02:10:58.308 --> 02:11:00.370]  They wanted to overthrow reality and common sense.
[02:11:01.370 --> 02:11:03.352]  It's all about them being God.
[02:11:04.540 --> 02:11:06.162]  So she said, businesses don't create jobs.
[02:11:06.242 --> 02:11:09.586]  It's like, if you've got a business, you didn't build that, the master planners did.
[02:11:10.447 --> 02:11:15.953]  Now some master planning, if the public's involved and wants to agree to it, sure, works fine.
[02:11:16.374 --> 02:11:20.318]  But they mean master planning every facet of your life, and that means dumbing you down.
[02:11:21.058 --> 02:11:27.502]  Giving you Common Core, giving you bad food, giving you GMO, so you fit into their model and don't get too uppity.
[02:11:28.002 --> 02:11:35.526]  Real eugenics isn't expand and make the good-looking and smart better and then kill the dumb people.
[02:11:36.467 --> 02:11:45.071]  It's target and dumb down the really smart people that aren't part of the elite while dumbing down and corralling the stupid people before the final extermination.
[02:11:46.632 --> 02:11:49.814]  So you have to understand there's scientific dictators at their core.
[02:11:51.502 --> 02:11:57.307]  And then when you see all the horrible things they do and why they wreck every city they run, that's the ether in which they swim.
[02:11:57.367 --> 02:12:00.009]  They're vulture capitalists who aren't free market.
[02:12:00.269 --> 02:12:03.251]  They want to wreck societies so they have full control.
[02:12:03.312 --> 02:12:04.633]  Cloward and Piven writ large.
[02:12:05.573 --> 02:12:06.194]  Agenda 21.
[02:12:07.615 --> 02:12:11.798]  How being poor, how having nothing is a great idea, but the elites all live like kings.
[02:12:12.759 --> 02:12:15.541]  Hillary says there's too many rich people, but she's basically tax exempt.
[02:12:15.862 --> 02:12:16.942]  Warren Buffett, same thing.
[02:12:17.203 --> 02:12:19.665]  They're just the most horrible people you can imagine.
[02:12:20.356 --> 02:12:22.899]  The Republican leadership, the Tory leadership works with them.
[02:12:23.199 --> 02:12:25.501]  It's part of the same ideology behind the scenes.
[02:12:25.761 --> 02:12:30.986]  But they have to act like they're good guys to fool the public into thinking that they're going to save us.
[02:12:31.947 --> 02:12:35.891]  In this election cycle, the election coming up next week is one of the most important ever.
[02:12:37.913 --> 02:12:44.640]  Because you've got a main Tea Party insurrection that's not perfect but it's real people being targeted by the Republican and Democratic leadership.
[02:12:45.558 --> 02:12:46.759]  Who are collecting money.
[02:12:46.859 --> 02:12:56.363]  George Soros and others are paying money right now, along with Bill Gates to target, along with Bloomberg to target Democrats that aren't anti-family or anti-gun.
[02:12:56.763 --> 02:13:00.025]  Some of these old Democrats, be black, white, Hispanic, they don't care.
[02:13:00.385 --> 02:13:03.827]  Who aren't real members of the New World Order, they're being removed.
[02:13:05.168 --> 02:13:06.508]  So, this is a takeover.
[02:13:06.608 --> 02:13:08.129]  Scientific, it's been done in other countries.
[02:13:08.569 --> 02:13:09.870]  The globalists have organized it.
[02:13:11.164 --> 02:13:13.825]  And they want absolute tyranny.
[02:13:14.425 --> 02:13:15.965]  They want to run your life.
[02:13:16.085 --> 02:13:18.126]  They want to control every facet of it.
[02:13:18.526 --> 02:13:23.508]  They want to take, on average, more than half of what you make, and then say you owe them for everything.
[02:13:23.588 --> 02:13:26.448]  You, a business owner, didn't hire people.
[02:13:27.989 --> 02:13:31.510]  I didn't start out 20 years ago on my own and have almost 50 crew members.
[02:13:33.751 --> 02:13:34.431]  I didn't do anything.
[02:13:35.351 --> 02:13:36.191]  Government did all this.
[02:13:36.231 --> 02:13:38.392]  If you write a book, if you write a song, government did it.
[02:13:39.545 --> 02:13:41.647]  If you write poetry, you didn't do it.
[02:13:41.707 --> 02:13:42.168]  Government did it.
[02:13:42.328 --> 02:13:43.189]  Everything is them.
[02:13:43.269 --> 02:13:43.889]  They're God.
[02:13:43.989 --> 02:13:44.610]  Keep the faith.
[02:13:44.650 --> 02:13:45.251]  Believe in them.
[02:13:45.851 --> 02:13:49.455]  Well, the problem is where they're taking you is hell on earth, as this film shows.
[02:13:49.495 --> 02:13:52.778]  So, the film, everyone should order it today.
[02:13:53.679 --> 02:13:55.240]  Everyone should show it to friends and family.
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:13:57.763]  Everyone should get it and give it as a Christmas or holiday gift.
[02:13:58.183 --> 02:14:01.166]  Everyone should buy a copy and donate it to your library.
[02:14:01.346 --> 02:14:02.688]  Probably a hundred people will watch it.
[02:14:03.516 --> 02:14:06.057]  And then you're also supporting this broadcast and Joel Gilbert.
[02:14:06.737 --> 02:14:12.300]  We carry his other film, it's shockingly powerful, Dreams of My Real Father, on Obama's True Providence.
[02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:13.340]  I believe it is the truth.
[02:14:14.040 --> 02:14:15.481]  He joins us now for the rest of the hour.
[02:14:15.541 --> 02:14:22.044]  We've got, I don't know, eight clips or so that we're going to be playing here on the transmission.
[02:14:22.604 --> 02:14:26.146]  Number one, Utopia's definition, progressives in history.
[02:14:26.166 --> 02:14:28.366]  Number two, The Wizard of Oz is an allegory.
[02:14:28.406 --> 02:14:28.847]  Number three,
[02:14:29.907 --> 02:14:31.829]  Socialism and human nature, number four.
[02:14:32.750 --> 02:14:33.791]  Number five, illegals.
[02:14:34.151 --> 02:14:35.313]  Number six, drug culture.
[02:14:35.413 --> 02:14:36.874]  Number seven, Islam in Detroit.
[02:14:37.575 --> 02:14:42.000]  And then number eight, he'll get into the effects of this on the victims of it.
[02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:45.904]  So Joel, describe clip number one we're going to be going to here.
[02:14:45.984 --> 02:14:46.664]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:14:47.225 --> 02:14:48.386]  Great to be here, Alex.
[02:14:49.107 --> 02:14:52.090]  Clip number one, we're going to look at the definition of utopia.
[02:14:52.110 --> 02:14:52.971]  It's a short clip.
[02:14:53.576 --> 02:15:01.058]  That shows how progressives believe that this idea of utopia, which was really just a fantasy, it wasn't real.
[02:15:01.519 --> 02:15:08.521]  It started out with Thomas More, even went back to Plato's Republic, and then Marx adopted it as his worker's paradise.
[02:15:09.061 --> 02:15:16.703]  And in the film we show that modern socialists adopted this fantasy as a realistic model of today's nation state.
[02:15:17.163 --> 02:15:18.964]  And it's failed miserably every time.
[02:15:19.524 --> 02:15:21.905]  And by the way, as I said, it's eugenics-based.
[02:15:22.245 --> 02:15:23.885]  Plato's the father of eugenics.
[02:15:24.905 --> 02:15:26.746]  And of course, eugenics goes back to the Greeks.
[02:15:27.206 --> 02:15:30.746]  And he said, kill all the poor people and only let the elite breed.
[02:15:30.766 --> 02:15:34.127]  And then he said, no, just actually dumb them down and control them like animals.
[02:15:34.467 --> 02:15:43.569]  And so Plato is the master, even today, 2,400 years later, of so much that the world has seen.
[02:15:43.609 --> 02:15:47.970]  I wonder if Plato is proud, wherever he's at, of Mao Zedong.
[02:15:48.922 --> 02:16:04.108]  Well, certainly the utopians of the modern era who murdered a hundred million of their own people in peacetime trying to mold them to fit into this perfect world are the evidence that the entire thing was just a fantasy.
[02:16:04.168 --> 02:16:04.888]  It wasn't real.
[02:16:05.369 --> 02:16:10.531]  But progressives have taken this model and they're conducting a war on the mind, a war on
[02:16:11.451 --> 02:16:36.629]  humanity to force us to fit into their uh... utopian ideology and traditional america the traditional family the church anything that's a middle-class traditional america supports reality free market system the constitution so the progressives want to destroy that whether it's bringing over millions of illegals or bringing over people that have ebola they want to attack the core
[02:16:37.489 --> 02:16:41.171]  Traditional society that will never buy into this utopian nonsense.
[02:16:41.651 --> 02:16:42.051]  That's right.
[02:16:42.071 --> 02:16:43.171]  Let's play the clip.
[02:16:43.211 --> 02:16:44.652]  The utopia definition.
[02:16:45.332 --> 02:16:49.554]  Progressives' main agenda is the creation of the perfect future.
[02:16:49.934 --> 02:16:50.314]  Utopia.
[02:16:50.915 --> 02:16:56.577]  Just like the president always says, we move towards making things better one little step at a time.
[02:16:56.777 --> 02:16:58.838]  Everything is seen as a step along the way.
[02:16:59.378 --> 02:17:00.239]  So you like my t-shirt?
[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:01.281]  I got it off of eBay.
[02:17:01.602 --> 02:17:02.323]  I like it, yeah.
[02:17:02.383 --> 02:17:02.623]  Yeah?
[02:17:02.944 --> 02:17:05.287]  That history is a continual progress.
[02:17:05.788 --> 02:17:12.778]  The evil fantasy of progressives that they can be as gods and recreate the world and make it a better place.
[02:17:15.666 --> 02:17:16.667]  That's clip number one.
[02:17:16.687 --> 02:17:18.608]  Now let's go to progressives in history.
[02:17:19.529 --> 02:17:20.630]  Tell us about this clip, Joel.
[02:17:21.070 --> 02:17:29.596]  Okay, so here we hear David Horowitz is going to talk about the progressive methodology to murder people that have ideas in their own head.
[02:17:29.996 --> 02:17:35.200]  He talks about how, for instance, the Cambodians murdered everybody with glasses.
[02:17:35.660 --> 02:17:43.306]  And you'll hear Oprah Winfrey, you'll hear a female voice, it's Oprah Winfrey, talking about what she thinks should happen to Americans in the South.
[02:17:43.926 --> 02:17:44.347]  Let's play it.
[02:17:45.749 --> 02:17:49.092]  In Cambodia, the communists killed everyone who had glasses.
[02:17:49.572 --> 02:17:51.214]  Because if you had glasses, you could read.
[02:17:51.975 --> 02:17:52.975]  You were educated.
[02:17:56.699 --> 02:18:00.041]  You have to do something with the people who have the bad knowledge in their head.
[02:18:00.642 --> 02:18:04.565]  So we're going to start with a clean slate and just create new human beings.
[02:18:07.928 --> 02:18:09.630]  It's a very evil idea.
[02:18:09.650 --> 02:18:12.873]  In the South, there are still generations of people
[02:18:14.372 --> 02:18:15.734]  And they just have to die.
[02:18:16.435 --> 02:18:17.656]  They just have to die.
[02:18:19.459 --> 02:18:24.546]  The most evil atrocities of our time have been committed by utopians in power.
[02:18:25.307 --> 02:18:26.729]  They think that they're the divinity.
[02:18:27.510 --> 02:18:28.731]  That's why they're so dangerous.
[02:18:28.972 --> 02:18:30.654]  That's why they kill so many people.
[02:18:33.010 --> 02:18:33.890]  It really is true.
[02:18:33.950 --> 02:18:37.712]  They're the ultimate bold control freaks to say what words we can use.
[02:18:37.772 --> 02:18:39.093]  Don't say the word bossy.
[02:18:39.573 --> 02:18:41.814]  Michelle Obama said she's going to tell us what to eat.
[02:18:42.174 --> 02:18:43.255]  And they really believe it.
[02:18:43.575 --> 02:18:51.018]  They tell Africans, you can't have houses and cars and air conditioning as Obama is, you know, they're like an imperial god or something.
[02:18:51.978 --> 02:18:53.059]  They just have no shame.
[02:18:53.119 --> 02:18:55.480]  Who are these people at their core?
[02:18:56.656 --> 02:19:04.818]  At their core, they are profoundly misguided, and also they are profoundly egotistical and narcissistic.
[02:19:04.838 --> 02:19:05.498]  That's it.
[02:19:05.958 --> 02:19:08.059]  They see themselves as the gods on earth.
[02:19:08.599 --> 02:19:11.200]  If they create a utopia on earth, they can be God.
[02:19:11.300 --> 02:19:14.621]  God is in heaven, reigns over heaven, so they see themselves
[02:19:15.581 --> 02:19:15.761]  Yes.
[02:19:36.247 --> 02:19:37.568]  This is what they want.
[02:19:37.608 --> 02:19:46.972]  And if you stand in their way, just like Obama's mentor Bill Ayers said in the 1970s, they wanted to put 50 million Americans in re-education centers.
[02:19:47.052 --> 02:19:48.152]  And kill 25 million.
[02:19:48.372 --> 02:19:52.854]  And kill 25 million in the Southwest if they didn't go along with this utopian society.
[02:19:53.274 --> 02:19:56.756]  So the scary thing is, this has been tried and failed so many times.
[02:19:57.256 --> 02:20:01.938]  Yet today, the Democrat Party has been taken over by these radicals.
[02:20:02.318 --> 02:20:08.403]  When they're licking their chops for blood at the bottom of the rabbit hole is their narcissistic wish to kill everybody.
[02:20:09.184 --> 02:20:09.924]  Ugh, sick.
[02:20:09.964 --> 02:20:15.449]  This winter, next to water and food, you need a safe, storable fuel supply for your preparedness needs.
[02:20:15.809 --> 02:20:17.451]  Spare fuel is the answer.
[02:20:17.751 --> 02:20:25.798]  Unlike gasoline, spare fuel can be safely stored with your other supplies for many years and works in any gas-powered vehicle or backup generator.
[02:20:26.078 --> 02:20:28.640]  With the bitterly cold temperatures predicted for this winter,
[02:20:28.900 --> 02:20:31.505]  Now is the best time to stock up on spare fuel.
[02:20:31.745 --> 02:20:34.149]  So, go to GetSpareFuel.com.
[02:20:34.370 --> 02:20:36.273]  That's GetSpareFuel.com.

[02:20:45.497 --> 02:20:48.198]  10 seconds is not enough time to protect your family.
[02:20:48.258 --> 02:20:50.039]  And what would happen if you were not home?

[02:21:18.680 --> 02:21:22.361]  The dollar has lost over 90% of its value in the last 60 years.
[02:21:22.642 --> 02:21:26.103]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.
[02:21:26.383 --> 02:21:27.484]  Ours is not immune.

[02:21:43.089 --> 02:21:46.210]  Do you want to leave a legacy of wealth or debt for your family?

[02:24:23.931 --> 02:24:29.313]  Joel Gilbert is our guest, going through clips from his new film that everyone should get.
[02:24:29.333 --> 02:24:30.573]  In fact, my copy's over here.
[02:24:33.615 --> 02:24:36.556]  There's No Place Like Utopia, a Joel Gilbert film.
[02:24:38.356 --> 02:24:44.699]  And it does a great job of showing the nightmare that is any type of so-called collectivism.
[02:24:45.652 --> 02:24:46.474]  Done on a mass scale.
[02:24:46.855 --> 02:24:53.069]  Collectivism works great if it's totally free, voluntary, and in a village.
[02:24:54.735 --> 02:24:56.336]  In fact, they've written books on the subject.
[02:24:56.736 --> 02:25:02.099]  Even socialists have written books on the subject and say, it only seems to work when it's small and local and people, you know, vote.
[02:25:02.139 --> 02:25:04.079]  But bigger than groups of a hundred, it doesn't seem to work.
[02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:04.920]  It starts breaking down.
[02:25:05.300 --> 02:25:08.502]  That's because corruption sets in and complexity gets involved.
[02:25:09.262 --> 02:25:10.262]  And his film gets into that.
[02:25:10.302 --> 02:25:19.007]  But beyond that, with Stalin, Lenin, Hitler, Mao, all were collectivists, all are what you'd call progressives, all believe in the power of the state and centralization.
[02:25:20.168 --> 02:25:25.992]  They just want raw power, black uniform, secret arrest, rape whoever they want, take whatever property they want.
[02:25:26.472 --> 02:25:34.958]  It is a criminal ideology of control freakdom driven by narcissistic, psychopathic, borderline personality disorder weirdness.
[02:25:36.246 --> 02:25:39.988]  Breathing demonic life into the state and then you're really in trouble.
[02:25:40.328 --> 02:25:42.569]  And it always wrecks everything in its path.
[02:25:42.909 --> 02:25:44.590]  It always creates desolation.
[02:25:44.951 --> 02:25:45.991]  Europe is collapsing.
[02:25:46.551 --> 02:25:48.753]  Everywhere socialism has come ends up collapsing.
[02:25:49.213 --> 02:25:53.315]  Ruins families, ruins cultures, ruins just everything.
[02:25:54.497 --> 02:25:58.418]  But it gives the scum an ether to swim in.
[02:25:58.618 --> 02:26:00.399]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:26:00.939 --> 02:26:04.900]  Tell us about The Wizard of Oz, why that's the big angle in your film, and we'll play this clip.
[02:26:05.320 --> 02:26:11.542]  Okay, The Wizard of Oz shows how socialism and progressivism relies on a cult of personality.
[02:26:11.982 --> 02:26:15.323]  Like this god-like figure will take care of you and do everything for you.
[02:26:15.943 --> 02:26:18.345]  The Wizard of Oz begins with a tornado.
[02:26:43.260 --> 02:26:44.802]  It's the disorientation.
[02:26:45.322 --> 02:26:46.443]  Everything is topsy-turvy.
[02:26:47.184 --> 02:26:52.088]  That's the kind of event socialists like to create, where you feel you've lost control.
[02:26:52.108 --> 02:26:56.673]  Things have gotten worse, and you can't get a handle on what you've grown.
[02:26:57.133 --> 02:27:00.476]  To be a nation that is afraid of everyone and everything.
[02:27:00.756 --> 02:27:01.977]  Fear of one another.
[02:27:02.078 --> 02:27:03.999]  I am so tired of fear.
[02:27:05.180 --> 02:27:05.421]  Help!
[02:27:06.041 --> 02:27:07.102]  Save me!
[02:27:07.422 --> 02:27:08.483]  It's after me!
[02:27:11.229 --> 02:27:12.810]  Well, then you land in Oz.
[02:27:13.931 --> 02:27:17.012]  You say, oh, we're glad you landed in Oz.
[02:27:17.032 --> 02:27:17.873]  We've got a wizard here.
[02:27:17.893 --> 02:27:18.833]  He can solve your problems.
[02:27:19.294 --> 02:27:21.235]  So we need you to be courage.
[02:27:22.135 --> 02:27:23.036]  To show courage.
[02:27:23.556 --> 02:27:25.577]  The wizard will give you real courage.
[02:27:25.717 --> 02:27:28.299]  Because he's special.
[02:27:29.219 --> 02:27:32.921]  Barack is one of the most brilliant men you will meet in our lifetime.
[02:27:33.402 --> 02:27:34.922]  This wizard knows everything.
[02:27:34.942 --> 02:27:35.903]  He can do great things.
[02:27:35.963 --> 02:27:39.105]  All you have to do is give him all your support, all your money, all your votes.
[02:27:40.100 --> 02:27:40.800]  And we need you.
[02:27:41.781 --> 02:27:44.582]  Barack can't do this without you.
[02:27:45.282 --> 02:27:47.483]  And life will be great if you just go down the yellow brick road.
[02:27:53.425 --> 02:27:54.125]  That says it all.
[02:27:54.186 --> 02:28:01.588]  And they know that they're formulaically following what Hitler did, what Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Fidel Castro, Hugo Chavez.
[02:28:02.149 --> 02:28:07.751]  It came out in the news, and I've been told by folks that live down there, that they have to pray at school for breakfast and lunch.
[02:28:08.697 --> 02:28:09.518]  To the government.
[02:28:09.618 --> 02:28:10.518]  To Hugo Chavez.
[02:28:10.538 --> 02:28:13.181]  And they have public TV where you pray.
[02:28:13.201 --> 02:28:17.104]  You go, our father who art in heaven, hallowed be Hugo Chavez's name.
[02:28:17.144 --> 02:28:19.906]  Thy socialist kingdom come, on earth as it is in heaven.
[02:28:20.306 --> 02:28:22.048]  These are just total whack jobs.
[02:28:22.088 --> 02:28:23.349]  But, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:28:23.369 --> 02:28:29.374]  I was going to say, well, Ronald Reagan had a great quote that the only places that socialism does work are in heaven.
[02:28:30.373 --> 02:28:33.135]  Where they don't need it, and in hell where it already exists.
[02:28:34.556 --> 02:28:41.242]  And what they do is they use this god-like figure to manipulate naive people, people that don't know better.
[02:28:41.722 --> 02:28:53.811]  And that's why we see today that the entire Democrat Party program is based on disinformation, fooling people with ideas that the rich people are keeping them down, that the rich people don't pay enough taxes.
[02:28:53.892 --> 02:28:59.236]  They make up all these stories to manipulate uneducated people, and that's the
[02:28:59.836 --> 02:29:01.317]  And that's where we're headed.
[02:29:01.357 --> 02:29:02.637]  We're getting the police state.
[02:29:02.657 --> 02:29:05.078]  We're getting everything that goes along with it.
[02:29:05.158 --> 02:29:07.419]  And it's true, the Democratic Party
[02:29:23.662 --> 02:29:26.307]  Has just gotten wildly radical, really communist.
[02:29:26.868 --> 02:29:29.813]  They use all the same lean forward, all this Marxist stuff.
[02:29:29.833 --> 02:29:31.095]  I mean, they mean business.
[02:29:31.846 --> 02:29:37.429]  Yeah, even the, I saw an advertisement for a guy running for, Wolf, running for governor in Pennsylvania.
[02:29:37.969 --> 02:29:46.713]  His entire program was, the middle class are getting screwed by the rich people, and he wants to fight for the middle and lower classes.
[02:29:47.213 --> 02:29:51.896]  Their ideology is a class-based society where people vote their class.
[02:29:52.136 --> 02:29:54.257]  And that's why they love racism as another form of class.
[02:29:54.517 --> 02:29:58.379]  Let's break that down straight ahead and ask, why do so many billionaires fund this then?
[02:29:59.059 --> 02:30:02.067]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.010 --> 02:30:05.677]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.035 --> 02:30:11.675]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[02:30:12.015 --> 02:30:15.796]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[02:30:16.536 --> 02:30:20.857]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[02:30:20.997 --> 02:30:27.798]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[02:30:28.298 --> 02:30:37.380]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:30:37.600 --> 02:30:43.005]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[02:30:43.165 --> 02:30:50.411]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.
[02:30:50.731 --> 02:30:53.033]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:30:53.314 --> 02:30:58.478]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the Info-One.
[02:30:58.778 --> 02:31:05.623]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:31:05.784 --> 02:31:08.786]  DNA Force from InfoWarsLife.
[02:31:10.247 --> 02:31:19.774]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[02:31:19.894 --> 02:31:25.759]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy-Powder, available through InfoWarsLife,
[02:31:25.959 --> 02:31:29.641]  Was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[02:31:29.821 --> 02:31:35.784]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients.
[02:31:36.004 --> 02:31:40.066]  Oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[02:31:40.186 --> 02:31:44.589]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[02:31:44.869 --> 02:31:47.090]  Oxy powder does not require time off work.
[02:31:47.290 --> 02:31:49.552]  And there's no need for bad tasting concoctions.
[02:31:49.833 --> 02:31:55.298]  Instead, OxyPowder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[02:31:55.519 --> 02:32:00.744]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.
[02:32:00.864 --> 02:32:06.130]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com to get started with OxyPowder.
[02:32:06.350 --> 02:32:06.831]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:32:10.234 --> 02:32:16.398]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:32:16.478 --> 02:32:19.120]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:32:19.160 --> 02:32:25.925]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:32:26.205 --> 02:32:29.067]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:32:29.187 --> 02:32:32.130]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:32:32.150 --> 02:32:34.131]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:32:34.151 --> 02:32:36.973]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:32:37.073 --> 02:32:42.596]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:32:42.796 --> 02:32:46.299]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:32:46.319 --> 02:32:49.280]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:32:49.420 --> 02:32:53.683]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have.
[02:32:53.823 --> 02:32:56.485]  For every modern independently minded household.
[02:32:56.705 --> 02:32:59.787]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.
[02:32:59.927 --> 02:33:06.251]  Go to Infowarsstore.com today to purchase your ProPure Pro1 G2.0 water filtration system.
[02:33:06.371 --> 02:33:06.851]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:33:24.372 --> 02:33:28.895]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:33:29.055 --> 02:33:32.977]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:34.658 --> 02:33:37.820]  Night on Bald Mountain.
[02:33:38.580 --> 02:33:40.161]  But for a minute it sounded like the witch.
[02:33:41.502 --> 02:33:43.523]  Here, that part right there.
[02:33:43.583 --> 02:33:44.623]  Riding her bicycle.
[02:33:44.743 --> 02:33:48.165]  I'll get you and your little dog too.
[02:33:48.265 --> 02:33:50.827]  Or the state saying, your kids belong to the state.
[02:33:52.509 --> 02:33:55.370]  And then it cuts to lean forward, which is a communist term.
[02:33:57.211 --> 02:33:58.391]  And control the future.
[02:33:58.691 --> 02:33:59.512]  Gain the future.
[02:34:00.412 --> 02:34:02.613]  Running everyone's lives, and we see where it goes.
[02:34:02.933 --> 02:34:04.514]  Let's say they had a great plan.
[02:34:04.934 --> 02:34:06.754]  They shouldn't be able to make us live by it.
[02:34:06.854 --> 02:34:07.915]  But they don't even have a great plan.
[02:34:08.995 --> 02:34:21.660]  Now, Joel's talking about this... It's what Charles Barkley came out and talked about, how he thinks that the quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks is being criticized because he's not, quote, black enough.
[02:34:22.816 --> 02:34:29.021]  And it's the same type of mentality where, oh, that guy's doing good, he must have sold out.
[02:34:30.642 --> 02:34:34.385]  That's why they push racism so much, so they don't have to actually deal with real issues.
[02:34:35.806 --> 02:34:37.227]  Now, does that mean there isn't racism out there?
[02:34:37.247 --> 02:34:38.428]  Of course there is, on all sides.
[02:34:39.414 --> 02:34:41.295]  Does it mean that there have been evils that had to be right?
[02:34:41.355 --> 02:34:57.603]  Of course, but they always want to keep it on those areas because they don't want to talk about the discrimination of big mega banks getting trillions of dollars to back up derivatives through the bipartisan banker bailout that's the opposite of free market and is a transfer to the ultra-rich.
[02:34:58.043 --> 02:35:06.748]  So what I have found, and what Ron Paul and others have documented historically, is that ultra-rich, George Soros, Ted Turner,
[02:35:07.867 --> 02:35:09.388]  Hillary Clinton's worth a hundred million bucks.
[02:35:09.408 --> 02:35:10.289]  That's pretty super rich.
[02:35:12.270 --> 02:35:20.096]  Warren Buffett, the biggest recipient of the banker bailout, but he goes on TV constantly to say, you know, my secretary pays more than I do.
[02:35:20.156 --> 02:35:20.777]  That's not right.
[02:35:21.057 --> 02:35:23.159]  Well, why'd you lobby to have the laws written like that?
[02:35:24.358 --> 02:35:29.540]  I have almost 50 people working for me, and the way they've written the laws now, we can't write off equipment or anything, basically, now.
[02:35:29.621 --> 02:35:35.243]  I have to, like, pay for it in taxes, like a new studio is something that I could sell tomorrow.
[02:35:35.603 --> 02:35:38.325]  It'd be worthless tomorrow, a big Infowar studio.
[02:35:38.785 --> 02:35:39.325]  Doesn't matter.
[02:35:39.765 --> 02:35:41.366]  Spend $500,000 on that.
[02:35:41.386 --> 02:35:44.107]  That's $500,000 Alex Jones made.
[02:35:44.868 --> 02:35:46.348]  That's why these accrual systems work.
[02:35:46.789 --> 02:35:48.389]  Now, that was a big globalist company.
[02:35:48.449 --> 02:35:51.531]  They have it all written in the Arthur Anderson-type grips.
[02:35:53.100 --> 02:36:01.182]  To certify it politically, and then like General Electric you pay zero tax, or Google 3% tax, and their executives are based in Luxembourg.
[02:36:02.603 --> 02:36:10.545]  But for somebody trying to run a small factory, or somebody trying to run a media operation, or somebody trying to run a restaurant, it's written where you get almost nothing.
[02:36:11.565 --> 02:36:14.566]  I pay over 70% in one form of taxes or another.
[02:36:15.543 --> 02:36:17.784]  Now again, I don't run this place just to make money.
[02:36:18.004 --> 02:36:27.770]  The main goals promote liberty and freedom and have a right to property, a right to raise my children, a right to religion, a right to the Second Amendment, and so many other things and not be conquered.
[02:36:27.790 --> 02:36:34.034]  It's about not being a slave, having an instinct and a mind and a gut to be free.
[02:36:35.515 --> 02:36:40.418]  But I realize I've got to have money to be able to fight those battles and be able to have a printing press.
[02:36:40.718 --> 02:36:41.578]  I'm for a free press.
[02:36:41.638 --> 02:36:42.459]  Everybody should own one.
[02:36:44.141 --> 02:36:47.824]  You don't have to have money to fight on a local scale, but you've got to have it to fight on a world scale.
[02:36:48.084 --> 02:36:55.591]  So yes, we fund ourselves through book sales, video sales, t-shirt sales, that all promote freedom and educate and inform and fight back.
[02:36:56.031 --> 02:37:01.356]  And through high quality supplements that have been shown to do amazing things for the immune system, the body, health, you name it.
[02:37:01.396 --> 02:37:03.457]  Cutting edge things at Infowarslife.com.
[02:37:05.179 --> 02:37:14.604]  And then they have Rolling Stone, and Nightline, and MSNBC, and CBS News, and ABC News, and everybody, Media Matters, demonizing me.
[02:37:15.205 --> 02:37:19.047]  How dare Alex Jones shell products and fund himself?
[02:37:20.468 --> 02:37:25.070]  Yeah, I should just get it out of stimulus funds, like MSNBC got like a billion bucks, their parent company.
[02:37:25.370 --> 02:37:27.832]  Hundreds of millions of it went to their NBC and MSNBC division.
[02:37:28.112 --> 02:37:31.514]  Rachel Maddow got a raise, it was reported, on your tax money.
[02:37:31.971 --> 02:37:35.455]  400-something million a year to NPR, then they beg for money.
[02:37:35.475 --> 02:37:37.677]  And that's okay, because it's Rockefeller Radio.
[02:37:37.998 --> 02:37:39.019]  He's a good rich guy.
[02:37:39.980 --> 02:37:42.983]  No, they're the ultra-rich that don't want competition.
[02:37:43.023 --> 02:37:44.064]  That's the other part of the equation.
[02:37:44.404 --> 02:37:49.450]  And who want to dumb people down and make it all about, hey, I don't want to become successful and middle class or wealthy.
[02:37:49.470 --> 02:37:53.054]  A lot of folks become middle class and don't want to keep working hard to become wealthy.
[02:37:54.306 --> 02:37:56.108]  I reached that point a long time ago.
[02:37:56.369 --> 02:38:01.776]  Hey, I don't need more than, you know, two cars and a house and medical care and decent clothes.
[02:38:02.076 --> 02:38:03.678]  I don't worship things, so I don't care.
[02:38:04.840 --> 02:38:06.602]  Then I realized people want to take it all away from me.
[02:38:07.303 --> 02:38:11.268]  I need to be strong and built up to defend myself, and that's come in handy, by the way.
[02:38:12.054 --> 02:38:16.177]  So they want people thinking small so they can run the world.
[02:38:16.237 --> 02:38:17.317]  They don't want you to have dreams.
[02:38:17.337 --> 02:38:22.421]  They want you playing video games and watching sports and fighting with each other so they can run the world.
[02:38:22.801 --> 02:38:24.102]  You can't have air conditioning.
[02:38:24.442 --> 02:38:25.703]  You can't have a car in Africa.
[02:38:25.783 --> 02:38:26.663]  You can't have a house.
[02:38:26.944 --> 02:38:31.827]  But Obama can fly on a giant jumbo jet with red carpets and spend $50 million a day in Secret Service.
[02:38:33.061 --> 02:38:41.947]  All these big rich people like Michael Moore suing states to stop paying taxes and paying almost no taxes and owning Halliburton and defense stocks.
[02:38:43.248 --> 02:38:46.049]  The issue is they're totally fake monsters.
[02:38:46.750 --> 02:38:57.637]  Al Gore buying some $8 million house right on the beach the same year he said that California by 2013 would be underwater from the melting ice caps.
[02:38:57.657 --> 02:38:58.698]  By the way, they're at record size.
[02:38:59.537 --> 02:39:00.658]  And he's never called on it.
[02:39:00.878 --> 02:39:01.978]  He invented the internet.
[02:39:02.018 --> 02:39:03.840]  He created the planet in seven days.
[02:39:04.200 --> 02:39:06.941]  Just all these lies, the disdain they have for you.
[02:39:07.161 --> 02:39:09.943]  I'm ranting, I'm going back to Joel Gilbert and Clips from the film.
[02:39:11.144 --> 02:39:13.885]  It's just that it's not rhetoric about how horrible they are.
[02:39:14.606 --> 02:39:16.367]  You know how Al Gore's dad, Senator Gore,
[02:39:17.506 --> 02:39:25.413]  And made all his money, all his money was being the top gopher minion for Armand Hammer, who was the main Soviet liaison to the U.S.
[02:39:25.793 --> 02:39:30.056]  and who ran giant steel mills and factories with slave labor in Russia.
[02:39:31.738 --> 02:39:35.040]  Al Gore is fabulously rich and hides most his wealth.
[02:39:35.821 --> 02:39:42.026]  And he wants you to pay him carbon taxes to breathe while he has buses and jets and more than 10 homes.
[02:39:42.467 --> 02:39:46.250]  And you've got Ted Turner saying kill everybody when he's got five kids.
[02:39:47.415 --> 02:39:51.658]  They're the ultimate hypocrites that have decided they run our lives.
[02:39:51.878 --> 02:39:53.580]  The ultimate form of domination.
[02:39:54.160 --> 02:39:56.182]  And you sell out to them for chicken feed.
[02:39:56.762 --> 02:40:00.545]  Let's go to socialism and human nature, and then get Joel Gilbert's take.
[02:40:00.605 --> 02:40:06.390]  But, look, in the aggregate, if we sell 10,000, 20,000 copies of this film, that's nothing to my operation as much as it costs.
[02:40:06.790 --> 02:40:08.552]  For Joel, it helps him make his next film.
[02:40:09.272 --> 02:40:12.134]  But you need to support independent media that promotes liberty.
[02:40:12.414 --> 02:40:15.015]  You need to get his film and show it to friends and family.
[02:40:15.575 --> 02:40:16.296]  And I watched the film.
[02:40:16.356 --> 02:40:17.676]  I agree with about 95% of it.
[02:40:17.997 --> 02:40:19.697]  It doesn't matter if I disagree with some of it.
[02:40:21.238 --> 02:40:27.982]  What matters is overall it's showing what poison collectivism is, and how dangerous it is, and how it's slavery.
[02:40:28.222 --> 02:40:30.383]  And people are ready to learn this and know this now.
[02:40:30.863 --> 02:40:32.184]  Especially folks that have lived under it.
[02:40:32.664 --> 02:40:34.005]  Not the trendies.
[02:40:35.174 --> 02:40:40.892]  They believe that they're part of something big and through extension they're taking over when they're the biggest chumps.
[02:40:41.173 --> 02:40:41.895]  Let's go to that clip.
[02:40:45.032 --> 02:40:46.873]  Socialism is all negative.
[02:40:47.154 --> 02:40:48.134]  It's a temptation.
[02:40:48.635 --> 02:40:50.556]  It can't bring to anything good.
[02:40:50.836 --> 02:40:52.497]  And I will raise the minimum wage.
[02:40:52.597 --> 02:40:55.319]  If you can't afford it, we will subsidize your care.
[02:40:55.879 --> 02:40:57.581]  Man, human being, is very weak.
[02:40:57.861 --> 02:40:59.522]  He is vulnerable for temptations.
[02:40:59.542 --> 02:41:02.384]  $4,000 tuition credit every student.
[02:41:02.424 --> 02:41:03.785]  You don't have to pay an income tax.
[02:41:03.825 --> 02:41:05.186]  You're already having a tough time.
[02:41:06.024 --> 02:41:09.766]  Part of human nature belongs to the devil, part to God.
[02:41:10.507 --> 02:41:14.129]  The part belonging to the devil makes him follow socialism.
[02:41:14.269 --> 02:41:17.151]  By giving them higher salaries, and I know you need that.
[02:41:18.752 --> 02:41:25.617]  Whenever you hear, I'm gonna cut your taxes, give you higher salaries, and free healthcare, and free everything, don't walk, run.
[02:41:27.118 --> 02:41:30.100]  Come in the alleyway, man, we've got something for you, and the guys are clearly thugs.
[02:41:30.640 --> 02:41:35.083]  Joel Gilbert, tell folks about who that gentleman was, the former KGB officer.
[02:41:35.683 --> 02:41:37.905]  Yeah, that was Konstantin Prebazhensky.
[02:41:38.005 --> 02:41:57.842]  He's a KGB defector, a former communist theorist, and he's throughout the film and he tells all the reality of socialism and communism, very knowledgeable, and he explains that socialism and communism are just a fairy tale for illiterate people who are led into essentially the gulag, the
[02:41:58.702 --> 02:42:07.306]  The end result of the Yellow Brick Road was not that Dorothy met a wonderful wizard, it's that he sent her to the Witch's Castle and she was taken prisoner in the dungeon.
[02:42:08.006 --> 02:42:12.028]  In the communist system, the flying monkeys get you in the end.
[02:42:13.048 --> 02:42:18.871]  Anytime you hear someone say, I'm going to give you all these goodies and we have the perfect formula for social change,
[02:42:19.713 --> 02:42:21.355]  You're going to end up in prison.
[02:42:21.755 --> 02:42:25.819]  Prison camp is the end result of every socialist experiment.
[02:42:26.319 --> 02:42:30.583]  And you're put there by these leaders who have fake lives and fake backgrounds.
[02:42:30.643 --> 02:42:33.646]  They're completely pathological liars.
[02:42:33.726 --> 02:42:36.148]  I documented in my last film, Dreams to My Real Father,
[02:42:36.989 --> 02:42:41.170]  That Obama's entire personal history, political and personal, is a lie.
[02:42:41.730 --> 02:42:48.992]  So I think by promising people all these wonderful goodies, in their mind it's a psychological issue.
[02:42:49.012 --> 02:42:54.114]  They're trying to relieve themselves of the guilt, on the one hand, for lying about everything.
[02:42:54.454 --> 02:43:00.976]  On the other hand, they're bringing their personal destruction and their own life to the public sector and destroying everyone else's life.
[02:43:02.476 --> 02:43:02.896]  That's right.
[02:43:02.936 --> 02:43:04.477]  Misery loves company.
[02:43:05.495 --> 02:43:14.740]  When poor folks, most of them are working so hard to know Obamacare raised payroll taxes, to have them say, you don't need to be paying income taxes, we're going to get rid of it for poor people, and then he increased it.
[02:43:15.821 --> 02:43:16.961]  That is so cold-blooded.
[02:43:17.902 --> 02:43:25.186]  It's so sick, and then a lot of poor folks, though, that are on welfare, I've run into them, they really think that if you've got a nice house and a car,
[02:43:26.662 --> 02:43:37.734]  And that if you have them come do a job that somehow you're using them when you're actually creating an economy and that it is the nouveau riche in all the studies that actually create the wealth and have the services.
[02:43:38.074 --> 02:43:40.216]  If they weren't there, there'd be nothing.
[02:43:40.897 --> 02:43:44.821]  What would you... They just don't know how economies work.
[02:43:44.961 --> 02:43:45.562]  It's so sad.
[02:43:45.962 --> 02:44:00.650]  Well, instead of the president explaining to people, like, thank God this guy opened a business and he's employing people in the neighborhood and you can get your friend to come work there and let's support this business and everybody come and buy ice cream at this new ice cream store on the south side of Chicago.
[02:44:01.150 --> 02:44:05.872]  Instead, the progressive mentality is, if you opened a business, you are evil.
[02:44:06.033 --> 02:44:07.573]  You did it on the back of someone else.
[02:44:07.713 --> 02:44:08.054]  It's this
[02:44:09.515 --> 02:44:10.155]  We're good to go.
[02:44:26.309 --> 02:44:28.510]  So they can't even make it because of the taxes.
[02:44:28.590 --> 02:44:33.111]  If you are being paid $500 a week, you should be paying no income tax.
[02:44:33.671 --> 02:44:34.131]  Zero.
[02:44:34.371 --> 02:44:35.291]  That's common sense.
[02:44:35.731 --> 02:44:38.432]  And until the 60s, no one was charged.
[02:44:38.952 --> 02:44:39.772]  It's just incredible.
[02:44:39.932 --> 02:44:41.573]  People say, well, how's the government run?
[02:44:42.173 --> 02:44:44.573]  Of all the other taxes, there's hundreds of them!
[02:44:44.873 --> 02:44:46.334]  And they're adding hundreds more!
[02:44:46.874 --> 02:44:47.034]  Yeah.
[02:44:47.748 --> 02:44:49.529]  Well, they take payroll tax.
[02:44:49.589 --> 02:45:00.496]  Of course, everything is taxed at a high level, but the progressive agenda is just a war on every level of society, every economic group, and especially the middle class because they want to eliminate it.
[02:45:00.936 --> 02:45:03.318]  In socialist economies, they don't have a middle class.
[02:45:03.978 --> 02:45:09.622]  There's an elite class that runs everything and controls all the wealth, and then one big lower class.
[02:45:10.502 --> 02:45:12.083]  But let's look at the next clip.
[02:45:12.123 --> 02:45:14.345]  It's about the illegals and what they're trying to do.
[02:45:24.628 --> 02:45:26.968]  We're recruiting and training Latino organizers.
[02:45:26.988 --> 02:45:29.429]  An integrated immigration system needs to be changed.
[02:45:29.469 --> 02:45:30.809]  We will transform this nation.
[02:45:30.849 --> 02:45:32.589]  We can have a new L.A.
[02:45:32.709 --> 02:45:32.969]  Senate.
[02:45:32.989 --> 02:45:35.050]  We can have stations in the border states.
[02:45:35.110 --> 02:45:36.010]  A stationary state.
[02:45:58.661 --> 02:46:03.286]  What percentage of people in Mexico want to go back to America?
[02:46:03.306 --> 02:46:03.766]  About 80%.
[02:46:03.906 --> 02:46:04.146]  90% say no.
[02:46:04.166 --> 02:46:05.808]  Why do you support Obama?
[02:46:05.828 --> 02:46:07.069]  Because of his health plan.
[02:46:19.629 --> 02:46:35.792]  I am going to march with you every step of the way to make sure that we are welcoming every striving immigrant who sees America the same way we do.
[02:46:39.716 --> 02:46:42.741]  Why don't you take care of yourself and work in your own country?
[02:46:42.761 --> 02:46:49.471]  The problem is that I can't take care of myself in my own country because of the system of socialism.
[02:47:09.918 --> 02:47:15.071]  Unbelievable sound.
[02:47:15.973 --> 02:47:18.018]  For people that don't speak Spanish, uh...
[02:47:20.049 --> 02:47:28.712]  Yeah, for people that don't speak Spanish, I was talking to illegals at Home Depot, and they said they left their countries because it was being destroyed by socialism.
[02:47:29.492 --> 02:47:40.536]  And you see Obama and his gang executing a strategy to flood America with illegals so that they can help target and destroy the middle class America.
[02:47:40.556 --> 02:47:48.379]  And when you know communist ideology and what they call the program that General Partin, the former head of the Air Force Weapons Development, three-star general, used to come on and break down with us,
[02:47:49.199 --> 02:47:54.981]  Once they take down a country, they collapse it in socialism, then bring in communism, that's the military occupation.
[02:47:55.602 --> 02:48:01.364]  Then they use that country to, quote, target the next country with socialism and then collapse it.
[02:48:01.384 --> 02:48:05.305]  And that's what you show in the graphic, is the country collapsing and then the communists take over.
[02:48:05.666 --> 02:48:07.006]  They admit that's the plan.
[02:48:07.046 --> 02:48:11.328]  Cloward and Pivot is just one variant that I mention a lot because people know what that plan is.
[02:48:12.128 --> 02:48:23.669]  It's so diabolical, and so Central and South America is collapsing under Communism right now, and Socialism, so they run up here to get the free healthcare, but no, that just collapsed their country.
[02:48:25.472 --> 02:48:31.039]  Well, they're being used, they're being used by our socialists to destroy this country as well.
[02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:43.174]  The difference between today's socialists and Marxists in the Democrat Party and the Marxists from the 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s is back then they would look you in the eye and say we're going to destroy you, we're going to destroy America.
[02:48:43.835 --> 02:48:48.880]  Now they look you in the eye and say, we want to help poor people, and then they do the same thing.
[02:48:49.280 --> 02:48:58.028]  They go, oh it's children when only something like 17% are under 18, and the illegals that are coming have huge criminal records, they can get fake identities.
[02:48:58.348 --> 02:48:59.590]  How do you become a new person?
[02:49:00.250 --> 02:49:02.492]  You don't have to change your identity or anything, you just come to the U.S.
[02:49:02.532 --> 02:49:03.553]  and be whoever you want.
[02:49:03.894 --> 02:49:06.296]  Kill as many people as you want, do whatever you want.
[02:49:07.199 --> 02:49:11.702]  Well, here in California, for example, 50% of the prison population are illegals.
[02:49:11.882 --> 02:49:15.444]  We have the Nortes, the Sedanos, different criminal gangs.
[02:49:16.645 --> 02:49:20.608]  People coming over the border are not people that see America the same way we do.
[02:49:21.068 --> 02:49:29.654]  They're people with completely different agendas, and Obama is lying to everybody with a very evil plan to destroy middle-class America.
[02:49:29.674 --> 02:49:30.014]  You're right.
[02:49:30.054 --> 02:49:31.795]  How long is the next clip on drug culture?
[02:49:32.175 --> 02:49:32.836]  Short, 30-40 seconds.
[02:49:32.856 --> 02:49:34.136]  Yeah, let's go ahead and play that clip.
[02:49:38.850 --> 02:49:45.056]  Colorado became a proving ground for the progressives and boy oh boy have they gone to town.
[02:49:50.242 --> 02:49:51.462]  Is it possible to get a sample?
[02:49:52.343 --> 02:49:52.383]  No.
[02:49:52.663 --> 02:49:52.863]  No?
[02:49:53.123 --> 02:49:53.423]  No.
[02:49:53.483 --> 02:49:55.644]  How hard is it to get the card?
[02:49:55.764 --> 02:49:57.444]  Well, I have these really high arches.
[02:49:57.504 --> 02:49:57.964]  Yeah, let's see.
[02:49:58.105 --> 02:49:59.105]  That's a bummer, man.
[02:49:59.125 --> 02:49:59.725]  That's a bummer.
[02:50:00.165 --> 02:50:00.685]  What a bummer.
[02:50:00.905 --> 02:50:02.646]  I gotta suffer with it every single day.
[02:50:03.386 --> 02:50:11.349]  The idea of the left is, if we can get these traditional ideas broken down, if people can say, well, let's smoke a little marijuana, what's the harm?
[02:50:11.609 --> 02:50:14.930]  Well, then the next barrier the left wants to attack is easier to attack.
[02:50:15.530 --> 02:50:16.611]  Well, okay, we do a little marijuana.
[02:50:16.631 --> 02:50:19.073]  What about a little bit of marijuana, maybe a little bit of cocaine?
[02:50:19.914 --> 02:50:21.575]  You've created a drug culture.
[02:50:23.377 --> 02:50:27.521]  And that's an easier culture to captivate, to control, and to enslave.
[02:50:29.042 --> 02:50:30.604]  And that's why George Soros backs it.
[02:50:30.824 --> 02:50:32.386]  And to be clear, I'm against the drug war.
[02:50:32.406 --> 02:50:33.388]  It's another form of evil.
[02:50:33.628 --> 02:50:35.590]  They always bring in the crisis off of their solution.
[02:50:36.211 --> 02:50:37.934]  But now you basically waive your rights.
[02:50:37.974 --> 02:50:44.182]  I've looked into these marijuana cards and things, where people are now put into the system as well, and it's just a way to control them.
[02:50:44.202 --> 02:50:45.663]  So I do agree with your perspective on that.
[02:50:46.297 --> 02:50:47.618]  Okay, let's play the next one.
[02:50:47.658 --> 02:50:52.702]  It's Islam in Detroit, and I show the connection between the progressive and Islamist ideology.
[02:50:52.722 --> 02:50:59.408]  All right, well let's stay there and talk about that teaming up that you cover in the film with Joel Gilbert in the final segment with our guest.
[02:50:59.428 --> 02:51:00.568]  We have a few more clips.
[02:51:00.909 --> 02:51:03.491]  We're going to also talk to Peggy Joseph.
[02:51:03.531 --> 02:51:04.492]  That's the last clip.
[02:51:04.852 --> 02:51:07.274]  Get the DVD at infowarestore.com.
[02:51:09.468 --> 02:51:12.051]  My name is Del and I live in El Cajon, California.
[02:51:12.352 --> 02:51:20.762]  I was concerned about my cholesterol readings because I knew that high cholesterol is related to clogging of the arteries and increases the risk for heart attack and stroke.
[02:51:21.242 --> 02:51:26.869]  One day, I heard an ad for heart and body extract and I was skeptical, but I decided to give it a try.
[02:51:27.430 --> 02:51:28.972]  Man, the numbers don't lie.

[02:51:38.937 --> 02:51:41.398]  Are you ready to surrender your right to buy body armor?
[02:51:41.658 --> 02:51:42.278]  No joke!
[02:51:42.439 --> 02:51:45.040]  Congress is now trying to outlaw civilian body armor.
[02:51:45.120 --> 02:51:52.083]  And if House Bill HR 5344 becomes law, you can kiss your right to protect yourself against rifle bullets goodbye.
[02:51:52.223 --> 02:51:54.885]  Don't put off your body armor purchase any longer.
[02:51:55.025 --> 02:51:57.266]  Go now to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[02:51:57.526 --> 02:52:01.287]  Thousands of military veterans trust their lives to infidel body armor.
[02:52:01.447 --> 02:52:02.287]  You should too.
[02:52:02.567 --> 02:52:05.288]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L.
[02:52:05.528 --> 02:52:06.928]  Infidel body armor.
[02:52:06.968 --> 02:52:08.149]  Just won't quit.
[02:52:08.529 --> 02:52:12.530]  This is a nationwide announcement for consumers owing back taxes to the IRS.
[02:52:12.750 --> 02:52:13.870]  The slowdown in the U.S.
[02:52:13.910 --> 02:52:17.051]  economy has forced renewed action by the Internal Revenue Service.
[02:52:17.271 --> 02:52:21.892]  The IRS is now accepting reduced settlement amounts from qualifying consumers who owe back taxes.
[02:52:22.092 --> 02:52:22.772]  If you're eligible,
[02:52:22.932 --> 02:52:25.934]  Your back tax settlement may be discounted by thousands of dollars.
[02:52:26.154 --> 02:52:30.237]  A specially assigned national hotline has been directly routed to Defense Tax Group.
[02:52:30.397 --> 02:52:34.300]  Consumers may now call and check their eligibility for a significant tax debt reduction.
[02:52:34.500 --> 02:52:41.265]  Financial stability is a major priority during this slow economy, so you're advised to dial this national hotline number now.

[02:54:12.230 --> 02:54:14.511]  We'll have Joel with us five minutes into overdrive.
[02:54:14.551 --> 02:54:21.152]  The film is available at Infowarsstore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:54:21.912 --> 02:54:24.013]  There's no place like Utopia.
[02:54:24.033 --> 02:54:25.153]  And again, this is all nuanced.
[02:54:25.613 --> 02:54:31.435]  They tell the giant poor masses that they've helped create with socialism that anybody with money is bad.
[02:54:31.835 --> 02:54:35.196]  Well, we know that's not true, but there are corrupt rich actually pushing this.
[02:54:35.856 --> 02:54:38.157]  I'm not what they call an Islamophobe.
[02:54:38.737 --> 02:54:42.959]  I think it's wrong to go target, you know, some of these countries and overthrow them and put radical Muslims in.
[02:54:43.299 --> 02:54:45.820]  So I know that's actually the double game going on.
[02:54:46.200 --> 02:54:53.022]  But it is true that in England, especially in other areas, they're using Islamic groups to join up with the progressives on the left.
[02:54:54.363 --> 02:54:57.864]  You never hear feminists criticizing radical Islam or any of that stuff, you know, to women.
[02:54:58.829 --> 02:55:01.051]  And then going after other people's free speech.
[02:55:01.091 --> 02:55:08.855]  And my big issue with a lot of what we see out of Islam is the attempts, you know, to restrict Western freedom.
[02:55:09.816 --> 02:55:10.917]  And I am a Westerner.
[02:55:11.077 --> 02:55:11.837]  I am into freedom.
[02:55:11.957 --> 02:55:12.798]  I'm a libertarian.
[02:55:12.998 --> 02:55:19.923]  I'm a paleoconservative, you could call me, but I don't like a lot of the stuff I'm seeing going on and the attempts to shut down my free speech.
[02:55:20.403 --> 02:55:22.144]  And I see the left teaming up with Islam.
[02:55:22.404 --> 02:55:23.585]  Let's play that clip.
[02:55:25.421 --> 02:55:26.862]  And then we'll, uh, get Joel Gilbertson.
[02:55:26.882 --> 02:55:28.743]  They're turning a church into a mosque.
[02:55:29.303 --> 02:55:37.108]  And by adding the Islamic architecture, the arches, and then the minaret, it becomes Islamic architecture.
[02:55:37.549 --> 02:55:38.569]  Do you live in the neighborhood?
[02:55:38.589 --> 02:55:40.130]  Used to be a Catholic church.
[02:55:40.791 --> 02:55:46.915]  Then the people left Detroit, they lost their following, so the Muslims are here now.
[02:55:46.935 --> 02:55:49.376]  I'm gonna stop by the American Muslim Center.
[02:55:49.997 --> 02:55:51.898]  It also looks like a former church, if you ask me.
[02:55:56.704 --> 02:55:57.185]  That's who I am.
[02:56:00.888 --> 02:56:07.013]  For the Jews and for the Israelis, we will say to them the word, that the time is going to come.
[02:56:07.354 --> 02:56:09.676]  This is the Islamic Center, the beautiful mosque.
[02:56:12.198 --> 02:56:14.060]  Il Allah ha il Allah.
[02:56:14.500 --> 02:56:15.781]  There is no god but Allah.
[02:56:16.422 --> 02:56:18.404]  Muhammad Rasool Allah.
[02:56:18.804 --> 02:56:20.726]  Muhammad is the messenger of God.
[02:56:29.465 --> 02:56:30.966]  Go ahead and give us your take on that.
[02:56:30.986 --> 02:56:32.568]  Yeah, that's the clip.
[02:56:32.668 --> 02:56:34.229]  Progressives destroyed Detroit.
[02:56:34.370 --> 02:56:46.121]  They emptied the city of all businesses and all people moved away and Islam moved into Dearborn and other places in Detroit and I went to several churches that were being converted
[02:56:46.781 --> 02:56:47.061]  I think?
[02:57:04.736 --> 02:57:13.166]  Sure, and some of these are radical sects that are blowing up and burning all the churches and killing Christians, and I guess we're kind of not being progressive.
[02:57:13.647 --> 02:57:15.248]  We should ask them to chop our heads off, right?
[02:57:15.689 --> 02:57:22.117]  Well, the Islamists and progressives both view Western capitalism, free speech, and free markets
[02:57:22.697 --> 02:57:24.418]  As an obstacle to taking power.
[02:57:24.598 --> 02:57:33.040]  Therefore, they are partners in targeting the middle class and the western free market system because we're the obstacle to their taking power.
[02:57:33.240 --> 02:57:38.002]  And this is why they work together so closely and that's why they're against America and against Israel together.
[02:57:38.742 --> 02:57:40.803]  Well, again, I have criticism of Israel as well.
[02:57:40.863 --> 02:57:47.685]  I try to look at all sides of this, but undoubtedly there's persecution of the Christian Church and of free speech in this country with the IRS.
[02:57:48.125 --> 02:57:50.766]  And the Feds just ruled that persecution will continue.
[02:57:50.806 --> 02:57:51.546]  Federal court today.
[02:57:52.301 --> 02:57:55.764]  Well, it's... Fine, chop my head off, I admit it, I'm bad.
[02:57:56.645 --> 02:58:06.613]  It's just another area of targeting the great American middle class that built this country and stands for so many great principles that save the world time and again.
[02:58:07.205 --> 02:58:08.806]  I want to come back in overdrive.
[02:58:08.906 --> 02:58:10.166]  Some stations won't carry this.
[02:58:10.406 --> 02:58:12.207]  Infowars.com forward slash show, folks.
[02:58:12.247 --> 02:58:21.470]  But for congruency, when we post this entire piece on the web tomorrow so people can watch it and see all the clips for radio listeners, we'll have this posted on Infowars.com tomorrow.
[02:58:21.850 --> 02:58:24.631]  We're also going to play the Larry Grafwald clip.
[02:58:24.651 --> 02:58:32.014]  People went to prison over his intel with their plans to put 50 million of us in forced labor camps and kill another 25 mil.
[02:58:34.099 --> 02:58:39.024]  Now, for population numbers, that'd be more like 75 mil in slave camps, about 40 mil in the death camp.
[02:58:39.905 --> 02:58:41.867]  And that's currently pretty much what their plan is.
[02:58:41.887 --> 02:58:45.991]  They'd like to put me in a camp and, you know, stomp my brains out.
[02:58:46.572 --> 02:58:47.152]  And you as well.
[02:58:47.293 --> 02:58:49.355]  Because that's what real power is all about, is them having their way.
[02:58:49.375 --> 02:58:50.256]  Because they're God.
[02:58:50.416 --> 02:58:52.138]  By the way, they're fascists.
[02:58:52.298 --> 02:58:54.380]  They're not even liberals or socialists.
[02:58:54.400 --> 02:58:54.800]  Stay with us.
[02:58:59.841 --> 02:59:02.264]  InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:59:12.336 --> 02:59:19.425]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[02:59:19.485 --> 02:59:20.105]  We're good to go.
[02:59:36.953 --> 02:59:39.274]  Fluoride Shield, Oxy Powder.

[03:00:15.731 --> 03:00:16.372]  Big Brother.
[03:00:17.032 --> 03:00:18.073]  Mainstream Media.
[03:00:18.814 --> 03:00:19.455]  Government coverage.
[03:00:19.475 --> 03:00:20.336]  You want answers?
[03:00:20.556 --> 03:00:21.357]  You want answers?

[03:00:22.178 --> 03:00:23.018]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:23.038 --> 03:00:23.739]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.759 --> 03:00:25.020]  He's Alex Jones.
[03:00:25.100 --> 03:00:30.486]  All right, in the interest of time, we'll shut this down and with Joel Gilbert go right into the film.
[03:00:30.926 --> 03:00:33.929]  Again, this is a full sneak peek review of the film.
[03:00:34.910 --> 03:00:37.032]  We'll post it in its entirety by tonight or tomorrow.
[03:00:37.052 --> 03:00:38.533]  It'll be up on InfoWars.com.
[03:00:39.133 --> 03:00:44.056]  But I just hope people, usually I don't push like this with films we promote, but it just really needs to be seen.
[03:00:44.376 --> 03:00:50.420]  The exclusive place to get it is InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:00:51.561 --> 03:00:55.624]  Get into Peggy Joseph, the last clip we're going to be playing here today, Joel.
[03:00:56.104 --> 03:00:59.565]  Okay, so Peggy Joseph is the infamous Obama voter in Florida.
[03:00:59.965 --> 03:01:06.147]  In 2008, they caught her on camera saying, Obama's gonna pay for my gas, he's gonna pay for my mortgage, this is fantastic.
[03:01:06.727 --> 03:01:23.431]  So, I tracked her down six years later, and she told me the story that she was just caught up in the emotion of the moment, because Obama was promising all this stuff, and the wonderful Wizard of Oz is gonna save my life, and make everything wonderful, and that she had actually now educated herself
[03:01:24.051 --> 03:01:27.335]  I won't have to worry about putting gas in my car.
[03:01:27.415 --> 03:01:36.224]  I won't have to worry about paying my mortgage.
[03:01:51.499 --> 03:01:51.880]  Hello?
[03:01:52.502 --> 03:01:52.843]  Hi.
[03:01:52.923 --> 03:01:53.224]  Hi.
[03:01:53.605 --> 03:01:54.688]  Are you Peggy Joseph?
[03:01:55.170 --> 03:01:56.353]  Yes, I am.
[03:01:57.075 --> 03:01:57.897]  I have a present for you.
[03:01:57.917 --> 03:01:59.201]  I brought you some ruby slippers.
[03:02:01.357 --> 03:02:01.977]  Slippers?
[03:02:02.197 --> 03:02:02.498]  Yes.
[03:02:02.818 --> 03:02:04.018]  I didn't order any slippers.
[03:02:04.058 --> 03:02:04.358]  I know.
[03:02:04.418 --> 03:02:05.819]  Well, I'm making a documentary.
[03:02:05.839 --> 03:02:07.040]  I'd like to talk to you.
[03:02:07.060 --> 03:02:07.520]  Do you mind?
[03:02:07.740 --> 03:02:09.481]  I won't have to worry about putting gas in my car.
[03:02:09.541 --> 03:02:11.142]  I won't have to worry about paying my mortgage.
[03:02:11.642 --> 03:02:13.983]  Did Obama pay for your mortgage?
[03:02:14.903 --> 03:02:16.184]  And did he pay for your gas?
[03:02:17.444 --> 03:02:18.245]  Absolutely not.
[03:02:18.545 --> 03:02:21.746]  Mortgage got worse and gas prices got higher.
[03:02:21.766 --> 03:02:23.947]  During that time, we needed a change.
[03:02:24.308 --> 03:02:26.208]  But a change for the better, not for the worse.
[03:02:26.789 --> 03:02:27.789]  He had a very big voice.
[03:02:28.309 --> 03:02:29.350]  Just like the Wizard of Oz.
[03:02:30.745 --> 03:02:32.947]  It wasn't with this little teeny, teeny, tiny man.
[03:02:33.388 --> 03:02:34.870]  And I think it's the same thing with Obama.
[03:02:35.510 --> 03:02:36.431]  Man behind the curtain.
[03:02:37.473 --> 03:02:39.855]  Not who we thought or expected him to be.
[03:02:39.875 --> 03:02:42.999]  I was Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz.
[03:02:44.721 --> 03:02:45.622]  That's how I feel.
[03:02:45.822 --> 03:02:46.642]  I was Dorothy.
[03:02:47.223 --> 03:02:50.985]  I started getting more educated about politics and reading more.
[03:02:51.525 --> 03:02:53.587]  What I learned is never trust the wizard.
[03:02:53.947 --> 03:03:02.513]  It's within ourselves to have the determination, the courage, and the brains to bring us to our destiny.
[03:03:03.073 --> 03:03:05.255]  Is America still the land of opportunity?
[03:03:05.955 --> 03:03:05.255]  100%.
[03:03:07.276 --> 03:03:07.556]  It is.
[03:03:08.036 --> 03:03:11.399]  Anything that you want to do or become, you can do it in America.
[03:03:12.611 --> 03:03:16.753]  And that's why they want to wreck it, so that you've got to go to them and they can control you.
[03:03:16.773 --> 03:03:18.114]  I want to play a final clip here.
[03:03:18.134 --> 03:03:26.198]  This is, as you mentioned it, the former Green Beret who infiltrated the Weathermen.
[03:03:26.218 --> 03:03:29.620]  These are the people that advised Obama, and this is what they plan to do to Americans.
[03:03:29.640 --> 03:03:30.140]  Here it is.
[03:03:31.001 --> 03:03:40.906]  And they felt that this counter-revolution could best be guarded against by creating and establishing re-education centers in the Southwest.
[03:03:43.400 --> 03:03:52.546]  Where we would take all the people who needed to be re-educated into the new way of thinking and teach them how things were going to be.
[03:03:53.447 --> 03:03:57.029]  I ask, well what is going to happen to those people that we can't re-educate?
[03:03:57.750 --> 03:03:59.791]  That are die-hard capitalists?
[03:04:00.892 --> 03:04:03.494]  And the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated.
[03:04:04.935 --> 03:04:12.719]  And when I pursued this further, they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these re-education centers.
[03:04:13.380 --> 03:04:15.101]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[03:04:16.682 --> 03:04:17.222]  25 million people.
[03:04:17.242 --> 03:04:18.102]  That's Larry Graff Wolf.
[03:04:18.262 --> 03:04:31.830]  I want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people, most of which have graduate degrees from Columbia and other well-known educational centers.
[03:04:31.850 --> 03:04:33.271]  Calmly talking about killing 25 million.
[03:04:35.009 --> 03:04:39.091]  Figuring out the logistics for the elimination of 25 million people.
[03:04:39.111 --> 03:04:39.651]  Of course.
[03:04:39.831 --> 03:04:41.472]  And they were dead serious.
[03:04:41.512 --> 03:04:42.853]  Larry Grafwald is in the film.
[03:04:42.893 --> 03:04:43.913]  That's why you need to get it.
[03:04:43.933 --> 03:04:44.633]  He just died.
[03:04:45.174 --> 03:04:46.454]  Was it late last year or this year?
[03:04:46.534 --> 03:04:47.274]  What a great guy.
[03:04:47.294 --> 03:04:47.875]  Yeah.
[03:04:48.175 --> 03:04:53.617]  And imagine having to sit around for years with the weathermen, with airs, all of them talking about blowing up cops and everything else.
[03:04:53.697 --> 03:04:54.538]  It's truly disgusting.
[03:04:54.938 --> 03:04:56.438]  Listen, thank you so much, Joel.
[03:04:56.458 --> 03:05:00.160]  We're going to have you back again soon on the nightly news as well.
[03:05:00.320 --> 03:05:01.961]  And just thank you for making a great film.
[03:05:02.241 --> 03:05:02.461]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:05:02.521 --> 03:05:03.582]  It'll definitely get people thinking.
[03:05:03.662 --> 03:05:04.142]  Great job.
[03:05:04.542 --> 03:05:04.863]  Thank you.
[03:05:05.103 --> 03:05:05.503]  Thank you.
[03:05:06.184 --> 03:05:07.386]  Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock.
[03:05:10.690 --> 03:05:14.656]  The Genesis Communications Network is one of America's premier broadcasters.
[03:05:14.676 --> 03:05:19.322]  Clear PMO food and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
