[00:00:01.044 --> 00:00:01.344]  Good!
[00:00:01.804 --> 00:00:03.245]  We just abolished the TSA.
[00:00:03.265 --> 00:00:04.946]  We just got rid of the NSA.
[00:00:05.246 --> 00:00:06.827]  We just got rid of the Federal Reserve.
[00:00:06.847 --> 00:00:08.628]  We have a stable currency.
[00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:10.429]  We just got the Florida out the water.
[00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.870]  We just got the GMO out the food.
[00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:12.791]  Oh no, no, no.
[00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:15.232]  We just finished the Super Bowl.
[00:00:15.452 --> 00:00:16.753]  That's what these people are cheering about.
[00:00:17.694 --> 00:00:20.715]  I would cheer about those other things, but the Seahawks won.
[00:00:21.316 --> 00:00:23.077]  The Broncos lost and that's why we're celebrating.
[00:00:23.097 --> 00:00:23.657]  Show them, show them.
[00:00:23.993 --> 00:00:26.434]  Show them all the confetti and all the glitz and all that.
[00:00:26.815 --> 00:00:31.317]  So yeah, we have a sold out stadium, 80,000 people.
[00:00:31.878 --> 00:00:36.400]  What's left of them anyway, the Seahawks fans, the Broncos fans got here pretty quick.
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.142]  Seahawks fans, they're cheering that their team won the Super Bowl.
[00:00:40.302 --> 00:00:43.564]  Not that, I guess they're cheering also that they had their rights violated.
[00:00:43.584 --> 00:00:47.366]  They got molested by TSA and they got patted down like we did when we came in.
[00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:52.429]  They have this security state going on out here, but we're gonna cheer because
[00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:54.732]  The Seahawks won the Super Bowl.
