[00:00:08.018 --> 00:00:08.378]  Thank you.
[00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:28.040]  30 million more people and has a promise of lowering premiums.
[00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:29.541]  Pretty good statement.
[00:00:29.982 --> 00:00:36.987]  We're not finished getting all of our reports back from CBO, but we'll have a side-by-side to compare.
[00:00:38.248 --> 00:00:40.069]  But our bill brings down rates.
[00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:47.655]  I don't know if you have seen Jonathan Gruber of MIT's analysis of what the comparison is to the status quo.
[00:00:48.075 --> 00:00:52.037]  Did you mislead Americans about the taxes, about keeping your plan, in order to get the bill passed?
[00:00:52.057 --> 00:00:52.097]  No.
[00:01:18.085 --> 00:01:18.546]  I did not.
[00:01:21.128 --> 00:01:22.068]  I just heard about this.
[00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.451]  I get well briefed before I come out here.
[00:01:26.772 --> 00:01:34.277]  The fact that some advisor who never worked on our staff... A lot in that room was thinking about, well, how could... talk about, well, how could we make this work?
[00:01:34.337 --> 00:01:37.580]  And Obama's like, well, you know... I mean, he's really a realistic guy.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.940]  He's like, look, I can't just do this.
[00:01:39.221 --> 00:01:44.745]  He said... Some advisor who never worked on our staff expressed an opinion that
[00:01:45.923 --> 00:01:47.543]  Uh, I completely disagree with.
[00:01:47.643 --> 00:01:50.404]  Next time I see him is, um, summer 2009.
[00:01:50.764 --> 00:01:59.566]  Uh, the, um, the big issue there is, uh, that he really wants to make sure moving forward on cost control.
[00:02:00.006 --> 00:02:11.069]  I think it'll, it's fair to say that there was not a, a provision in the healthcare law that was not extensively debated, uh, and was fully transparent.
[00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:13.790]  Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage.
[00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.551]  And basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever.
[00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:21.972]  But basically, that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass.
[00:02:22.112 --> 00:02:27.934]  And to me, the most important piece, and in some sense the piece I guess I'm most disappointed that Doug and I disagree on, is the Cadillac tax.
[00:02:28.354 --> 00:02:35.856]  Okay, economists have called for 40 years to get rid of the regressive, inefficient, and expensive tax subsidy to the employer provided health insurance.
[00:02:36.877 --> 00:02:43.129]  No economist would ever set up a health system with a tax subsidy employer provided health insurance.
[00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:44.070]  It's a terrible policy.
[00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:47.412]  Turns out politically, it's really hard to get rid of.
[00:02:47.932 --> 00:02:53.173]  And the only way we could take it on was first by mislabeling it, calling it a tax on insurance plans rather than a tax on people.
[00:02:53.193 --> 00:02:55.654]  And we all know it's really a tax on people who hold those insurance plans.
[00:02:56.434 --> 00:02:57.634]  And the second was to start it late.
[00:02:58.075 --> 00:02:58.975]  Started in 2018.
[00:02:59.335 --> 00:03:00.155]  This is one guy.
[00:03:00.195 --> 00:03:01.476]  I don't know who this guy was.
[00:03:01.616 --> 00:03:04.636]  All I know is that it's important for people to have health insurance.
[00:03:04.676 --> 00:03:08.577]  And if you guys are saying people shouldn't have health insurance, I don't know where you're coming from.
[00:03:08.618 --> 00:03:09.158]  Are you that cruel?
[00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:16.823]  The fact is I think it's actually Republicans who haven't been particularly transparent or even honest about the true impact of those.
[00:03:17.123 --> 00:03:21.087]  Well, it is Republicans who have been less than forthright and transparent.
[00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:27.212]  It's not true.
[00:03:28.253 --> 00:03:31.555]  And one more misunderstanding I want to clear up.
[00:03:32.776 --> 00:03:33.397]  Under our plan,
[00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.853]  No federal dollars will be used to fund abortions.
[00:03:38.214 --> 00:03:40.616]  And federal conscience laws will remain in place.
[00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.782]  Now... What's wrong, McRubber?
[00:03:45.822 --> 00:03:46.743]  You can diffuse it, right?
[00:03:46.763 --> 00:03:47.824]  Are you kidding me?
[00:03:47.844 --> 00:03:48.765]  Look at all this crap.
[00:03:48.785 --> 00:03:50.507]  There's like a million wires in here.
[00:03:50.547 --> 00:03:52.710]  More like a three-wire guy.
[00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:54.171]  McRubber.
[00:04:05.322 --> 00:04:09.708]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:04:10.008 --> 00:04:12.291]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:04:12.591 --> 00:04:22.283]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
[00:04:22.603 --> 00:04:30.828]  That's why we're rolling out on a 100% Made in America line of incredible pro-liberty apparel.
[00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:33.570]  We are re-popularizing liberty.
[00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.233]  We are helping fellow Americans rediscover what made this country great.
[00:04:38.613 --> 00:04:39.994]  We are the spirit of 1776.
[00:04:41.015 --> 00:04:43.276]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[00:04:43.336 --> 00:04:48.580]  We are all brothers and sisters in arms in the animating contest of liberty.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.461]  We're good to go.
