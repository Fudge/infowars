[00:00:12.136 --> 00:00:14.257]  And welcome to the Obama Distraction.
[00:00:14.777 --> 00:00:21.899]  I'm sorry to interrupt your coverage of the VA scandal, but people are starting to get tired of watching the Malaysian flight investigation.
[00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:29.440]  So, the President's feelings are starting to get a little bit hurt due to the fact that his government-run health care plan is not working out too good.
[00:00:30.281 --> 00:00:35.082]  So, without further ado, I bring to you the Obama Distraction, Beau Bergdahl.
[00:00:35.919 --> 00:00:42.205]  Bergdahl claimed he was nabbed when he fell behind on patrol, but his fellow soldiers say he simply walked off post.
[00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:51.795]  The military devoted weeks to searching for him, and now some in his battalion are claiming that at least six soldiers were killed during those missions.
[00:00:52.356 --> 00:00:58.122]  All right, we're going to break down the video of the Beau Bergdahl release from the Taliban to American soldiers.
[00:00:59.454 --> 00:01:01.616]  As you can see, Bosun in the back of the Taliban vehicle.
[00:01:01.636 --> 00:01:05.861]  At this point, the Taliban guy is telling him to not come back to Afghanistan.
[00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:08.283]  And I don't think he really means just him overall.
[00:01:08.323 --> 00:01:10.806]  I think he means it's a message to America.
[00:01:11.146 --> 00:01:11.647]  Stay out.
[00:01:11.967 --> 00:01:12.668]  We don't want you here.
[00:01:14.309 --> 00:01:14.830]  Here we are.
[00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.971]  Helicopter coming in.
[00:01:16.712 --> 00:01:18.454]  Taliban guys, RPGs on the mountain.
[00:01:19.468 --> 00:01:23.831]  But just remember too though, the government was saying when they found Bergdahl, he was in a very weakened state.
[00:01:24.272 --> 00:01:28.155]  Looks to me, he's standing up on his own and he is walking away just fine.
[00:01:28.795 --> 00:01:34.139]  Notice that pat on the back from this op right here, making sure he doesn't have a vest on or anything like that.
[00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.022]  Alright, he's walking up to the helicopter with these guys.
[00:01:38.103 --> 00:01:39.584]  Notice none of these guys are armed.
[00:01:40.144 --> 00:01:41.765]  The Taliban had the white flag up.
[00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:44.347]  Bill Bergdahl once again gets patted down.
[00:01:45.368 --> 00:01:45.628]  Checked.
[00:01:45.688 --> 00:01:48.471]  Make sure he's got no weapons or anything that's threatening.
[00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.170]  And they're going to put him in the helicopter and fly off.
[00:02:08.953 --> 00:02:11.454]  What you just heard Bo Bergdahl's former team leader say is in fact true.
[00:02:11.494 --> 00:02:18.296]  If you go to the wikileaks.org, Afghan war files, you can actually read everything that happened that day.
[00:02:18.316 --> 00:02:19.597]  Where they actually say that
[00:02:33.382 --> 00:02:36.184]  They found him actively seeking the Taliban.
[00:02:36.224 --> 00:02:42.907]  They heard chatter and the Coochee tribe picked him up asking for Taliban who spoke English.
[00:02:43.487 --> 00:02:44.688]  I mean, it's all right there.
[00:02:45.408 --> 00:02:49.631]  This is a big distraction from the VA, but it is a story worth covering.
[00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:58.839]  Alright, so if you're tired of the mainstream media mass distraction, make sure you tune in to InfoWars and also go to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.304]  And don't forget, your username and password can be shared with up to 10 people.
[00:03:03.544 --> 00:03:07.908]  Turn off that Time Warner cable box and tune in to real news.
[00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:08.929]  That's an order.
