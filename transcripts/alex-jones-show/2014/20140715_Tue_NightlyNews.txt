[00:00:19.454 --> 00:00:21.475]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.535 --> 00:00:25.678]  It is Tuesday, July 15, 2014, and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:25.978 --> 00:00:26.999]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.244]  Tonight, DHS swarms a small town to catch one man.
[00:00:35.844 --> 00:00:40.407]  Then, police resort to crank calls to justify home invasions.
[00:00:41.323 --> 00:00:44.968]  And are the feds editing wiki pages to smear patriots?
[00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:49.314]  That's next on the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:50.176 --> 00:00:51.417]  I'm sick of their crap!
[00:00:52.038 --> 00:00:57.065]  You gotta find your humanity and you gotta start kicking some New World Order ass in the Info Wars!
[00:00:58.223 --> 00:01:01.446]  Well, as long as there has been news, there has been spin.
[00:01:01.726 --> 00:01:07.830]  And with every new administration and all of the new scandals, comes the need to rein all of that in and cover it up.
[00:01:08.171 --> 00:01:12.894]  We know how the state-run media gets its talking points directly from the White House.
[00:01:13.375 --> 00:01:17.678]  But nowadays, more and more people are getting their information online.
[00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:22.642]  And the Obama administration has already admitted that they're losing the info war.
[00:01:23.062 --> 00:01:27.926]  They're losing out to independent media and people being able to access information on the internet.
[00:01:28.526 --> 00:01:36.689]  So now, of course, they're having to come up with new tactics in order to stem this tide and to keep up with all these emerging technologies.
[00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:41.391]  And that, of course, is why there is this all-out assault on the Internet.
[00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:43.412]  Now take Wikipedia, for instance.
[00:01:43.892 --> 00:01:50.557]  Now it's long been said you don't want to quote Wikipedia as a source because really anyone can get in there and edit the information.
[00:01:50.998 --> 00:02:00.205]  Well now we can confirm that government IP addresses are actually changing entries to smear independent media personalities.
[00:02:00.785 --> 00:02:07.030]  Now I'm talking about edits to the Wikipedia profiles of Alex Jones and RT's Abby Martin.
[00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.052]  They were edited just this week.
[00:02:09.432 --> 00:02:23.544]  Now yesterday, Alex Jones' Wikipedia profile was attempted to be edited by adding the sentence, following his appearances on Russia Today, there were allegations that he was a disinformation agent with ties to the Kremlin.
[00:02:24.264 --> 00:02:24.504]  Right.
[00:02:24.824 --> 00:02:27.406]  There has never been any allegations of that.
[00:02:27.866 --> 00:02:32.829]  Now, that IP address was traced to Information Systems, U.S.
[00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:34.290]  House of Representatives.
[00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.454]  Now, there was also a separate edit describing RT host Abby Martin as a Russian propagandist.
[00:02:41.815 --> 00:02:50.280]  Now, this is despite the fact that Martin made headlines back in March for publicly criticizing Russia's involvement in Crimea on her own
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.321]  Show!
[00:02:51.842 --> 00:02:58.771]  Now that IP address leads back to that same computer there at the US House of Representatives.
[00:02:59.151 --> 00:03:04.759]  Now, we've been reporting on the government's plan to kill the Internet with disinformation,
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:21.684]  But now it has been confirmed and according to some newly released documents from Edward Snowden, basically he's saying that the British government also engages in fake victim blog posts as well as online false flag operations.
[00:03:22.084 --> 00:03:28.186]  They use tools that can sway online polls and manipulate the public sentiment on the internet.
[00:03:28.206 --> 00:03:33.207]  We've already reported before how they go in chat rooms, they've disabled comment sections,
[00:03:33.687 --> 00:03:39.072]  Now, these tools are also giving British spies the ability to actively monitor Skype calls.
[00:03:39.592 --> 00:03:45.377]  And this is just many of the other creative ways of the government using internet deception.
[00:03:45.878 --> 00:03:58.829]  Now, of course, these latest revelations come amidst the time UK Parliament is debating whether to fast-track a bill that would allow even more spying, even more sweeping surveillance powers, and
[00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:11.940]  Of course, just like they're trying to do here in America with CISPA, SOPA, and PIPA, they want to fast track this as fast as they can because, you know, all this spying and surveillance will just keep us safe.
[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:18.846]  And here we're pointing out that it's the government disinfo agents that we need to be protected from.
[00:04:19.406 --> 00:04:24.547]  Now the Pentagon and that spy agencies have been busted manipulating the internet.
[00:04:24.567 --> 00:04:27.548]  They've been busted, you know, manipulating social media.
[00:04:27.988 --> 00:04:32.369]  They're promoting false propaganda and stifling any dissenting information.
[00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:43.791]  Now we've documented for years that big social media sites like Reddit are censored and manipulated, but now Watson is reporting on a Redditor who calls himself Freedom Intensifies, who posted a
[00:04:44.491 --> 00:04:51.835]  Fascinating analysis on military manipulation of Reddit by a specific base and this is Elgin Air Force Base.
[00:04:52.315 --> 00:05:06.022]  Now he says that he links to a paper funded by Eglin Air Force Base studying how to establish majority views, social control, influence conversations, contain unwanted information.
[00:05:06.582 --> 00:05:19.394]  Of course, Eglin Air Force Base is a major hub for Pentagon domestic manipulation programs online, and Freedom Intensifies points out that a lot of this got established right when the War on Terror started.
[00:05:19.434 --> 00:05:26.861]  Of course, the government has always used the media as its propaganda arm, but of course it's intensified following the War on Terror.
[00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:37.532]  Um, but with the repeal of the Smith Month Modernization Act last year, it's only intensified and has actually legalized domestic propaganda.
[00:05:37.873 --> 00:05:41.297]  Here's what I had to say about this domestic propaganda campaign last year.
[00:05:42.418 --> 00:05:48.879]  The Obama administration is protecting its lapdog journalists while instilling fear in those that might dare ask questions.
[00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.580]  Obama's hired even more journalists to be a part of his team.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:03.663]  Up to 19 journalists from influential outlets like ABC, CNN, The Washington Times, and LA Times are going to work for the very administration they should be holding accountable.
[00:06:04.423 --> 00:06:13.728]  So don't expect any of those journalists to report on their bosses' debacles, like Obamacare, or the illegal NSA spying and wiretapping, or Benghazi.
[00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:24.515]  Maybe Obama needed more journalists on his Transforming America team for the big rollout of government-funded news after the recent repeal of the domestic propaganda ban.
[00:06:24.935 --> 00:06:34.081]  Those journalists can now use their talent to influence public opinion, shaping a favorable narrative for war or for giving up your rights in favor of safety.
[00:06:34.101 --> 00:06:41.426]  Now clearly one of those lapdog journalists is the new White House press secretary with the very ironic name Josh Earnest.
[00:06:41.786 --> 00:06:50.952]  Here's what he had to say on Monday to reporters when they asked him, you know, how does the White House react to the notion that the president is a bystander to all these crises?
[00:06:51.393 --> 00:06:54.395]  And he replied in a typical Orwellian fashion,
[00:06:55.015 --> 00:07:02.884]  The Obama administration's foreign policies in a number of areas have substantially improved the tranquility of the global community.
[00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:12.035]  Now, ABC News' John Carl, who I'm actually growing quite fond of, let him have it, and he pointed out
[00:07:12.896 --> 00:07:28.586]  What's looking like an all-out war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, there's jihadists taking over vast territory in Iraq and Syria, the Russian aggression in Ukraine, and of course concerns about the Chinese handling of territorial disputes in the South China Sea.
[00:07:29.166 --> 00:07:37.011]  And to Ernest's response, Carl said, it doesn't really seem like a time to be touting tranquility on the international scene.
[00:07:37.751 --> 00:07:58.040]  But of course, this administration isn't concerned with the truth or with upholding the Constitution, and Earnest's response just further proves their expertise in gaslighting and just trying to convince the American public that Obama, of course, is the Lord and Savior, and no, there's not wars breaking out everywhere.
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:03.403]  Obama has brought tranquility to the global community, because war is peace.
[00:08:04.623 --> 00:08:04.883]  Right?
[00:08:05.404 --> 00:08:14.993]  Now, when you have a bloated and corrupt government who gets away with breaking the laws with impunity, this is just going to trickle down into your local agencies.
[00:08:15.073 --> 00:08:16.594]  Of course, they're going to be doing the same.
[00:08:17.074 --> 00:08:20.197]  Now, this next report is about Durham, North Carolina.
[00:08:20.297 --> 00:08:28.985]  Police there actually tricking people into giving up their constitutional rights by using fake 911 calls to enter their homes.
[00:08:29.025 --> 00:08:29.806]  I think so.
[00:08:45.845 --> 00:08:56.756]  This departmental policy was revealed during a court hearing when the officer wasn't able to produce a warrant that he entered a woman's home and then arrested her for possessing marijuana.
[00:08:57.136 --> 00:09:05.505]  Well, he then had to cop to using this deceitful tactic that he entered the home illegally and then the charges against the woman were dropped.
[00:09:05.965 --> 00:09:15.349]  Now, the officer claimed that his superiors allow such unlawful entries under a departmental policy in cases where domestic violence is alleged.
[00:09:15.749 --> 00:09:21.791]  Now, the judge overseeing the case said, you cannot enter someone's home based on a lie.
[00:09:23.792 --> 00:09:29.734]  I just wish we could have the same judge there overseeing the NSA's unlawful intrusion.
[00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:43.120]  But here we have cops tricking people out of their constitutional rights with lies while communities are just sitting idly by while the police stations are increasingly becoming militarized.
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:50.082]  Now we reported last week about a DHS, there was a militarized invasion of a small town in Illinois, population 850.
[00:09:52.043 --> 00:09:54.244]  It was an unannounced show of force.
[00:09:54.625 --> 00:10:02.209]  It culminated in a local school field being used as a staging ground for all of this heavy-duty equipment and weaponry.
[00:10:02.249 --> 00:10:05.731]  The citizens there reported being really frightened.
[00:10:06.171 --> 00:10:12.155]  And then, of course, the authorities initially refused to explain the reason behind this brute show of force.
[00:10:12.715 --> 00:10:18.999]  And it later emerged that a raid had been carried out on a house three miles away to catch one man.
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:26.021]  So again, we've got this brute show of force to catch one guy who's dealing in child porn.
[00:10:26.181 --> 00:10:33.503]  Meanwhile, we have actual human traffickers and their child victims flowing freely across the borders.
[00:10:33.983 --> 00:10:39.744]  So this over-militarization of the police force is not about protecting American citizens.
[00:10:40.164 --> 00:10:50.166]  It is about policing us, increasingly policing us and acclimating us to these martial law style tactics as part of the new normal.
[00:10:50.566 --> 00:10:51.527]  That's what this is about.
[00:10:51.607 --> 00:10:54.591]  Those Border Patrol agents should have been at the border.
[00:10:54.611 --> 00:10:59.177]  Now coming up after the break, we're going to have even more on the border crisis.
[00:11:05.239 --> 00:11:10.801]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:11:11.021 --> 00:11:18.264]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:11:18.404 --> 00:11:21.645]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:11:21.765 --> 00:11:23.526]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:11:23.806 --> 00:11:28.369]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:11:28.449 --> 00:11:31.210]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:37.153]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:11:37.333 --> 00:11:40.795]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[00:11:40.995 --> 00:11:46.038]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[00:11:46.258 --> 00:11:49.240]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:55.345]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[00:11:55.445 --> 00:11:57.447]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.
[00:11:57.607 --> 00:12:03.051]  Secure your super high quality Nascent Iodine today at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:12:09.096 --> 00:12:16.262]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:12:16.362 --> 00:12:18.544]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:12:18.724 --> 00:12:23.928]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:12:24.088 --> 00:12:29.172]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:12:29.312 --> 00:12:32.413]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:12:32.714 --> 00:12:36.615]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:12:36.835 --> 00:12:41.137]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:12:41.217 --> 00:12:51.342]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:12:51.562 --> 00:12:55.945]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[00:12:56.045 --> 00:13:02.489]  The new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:13:02.649 --> 00:13:06.651]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:13:14.451 --> 00:13:20.594]  Well, life jackets of all sizes and rafts are piling up along the banks of the Rio Grande.
[00:13:20.654 --> 00:13:25.517]  There have been reports of the bodies of young children being found floating in the water.
[00:13:25.917 --> 00:13:35.562]  Of course, all of this is happening as a relentless onslaught of illegal immigrants are flooding the borders, and then they eagerly surrender themselves to border patrol.
[00:13:36.102 --> 00:13:41.465]  One child from El Salvador told a Fox News reporter, you're going to be out here a long time.
[00:13:41.685 --> 00:13:43.186]  There are thousands of us.
[00:13:43.726 --> 00:13:52.954]  Now, many of these illegal immigrants are telling Border Patrol and Texas state authorities that they learned from the media in their home countries that if they cross the border to the U.S.
[00:13:53.134 --> 00:13:56.477]  right now, they'd be given papers and allowed to stay.
[00:13:56.817 --> 00:14:06.026]  Well now, according to a blockbuster leaked federal government intelligence report, illegal immigrant smugglers are preying on mothers in Central America.
[00:14:06.046 --> 00:14:09.749]  They're falsely guaranteeing them citizenship in the United States.
[00:14:10.329 --> 00:14:18.153]  Now, of course, some of these coyotes work for criminal organizations and have been dealing in human trafficking for years.
[00:14:18.634 --> 00:14:19.314]  Now, U.S.
[00:14:19.374 --> 00:14:34.723]  General John Kelly told lawmakers that drug cartels, some of whom are involved in financing terrorism operations, were directing and reaping the profits from sophisticated smuggling operations that had advertised the leniency of U.S.
[00:14:34.803 --> 00:14:35.163]  laws.
[00:14:35.643 --> 00:14:48.528]  In Guatemala, coyotes are charging between $6,000 and $9,000 per person and one coyote was reportedly making $50,000 a week smuggling children into the United States.
[00:14:48.968 --> 00:14:58.172]  Now the coyotes are actually advertising to parents that they are going to take these kids out of poverty and out of danger and they're going to bring them to the U.S.
[00:14:58.472 --> 00:15:01.213]  where they will be educated and taken care of.
[00:15:01.673 --> 00:15:10.461]  So can you even imagine being one of these parents who are now reading about these reports of the bodies of children washing up on the banks of the Rio Grande.
[00:15:10.481 --> 00:15:16.347]  They're not able to identify these children in a lot of cases and here all of these parents are being
[00:15:16.827 --> 00:15:20.888]  Manipulated by these criminal cartels in some instances.
[00:15:21.248 --> 00:15:24.229]  Now we've reported that the border agents are saying that the U.S.
[00:15:24.309 --> 00:15:27.530]  government is complicit in this smuggling cycle.
[00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:34.732]  They're actually helping to complete it by bringing the unaccompanied minors into the country and giving them bus tickets somewhere for free.
[00:15:35.272 --> 00:15:41.614]  Now there's no telling when these children are sent to a sponsor or to a family member who are they going to.
[00:15:41.974 --> 00:15:44.255]  There's no way of proving who these people are.
[00:15:44.335 --> 00:15:53.278]  There's been reports that some of these unaccompanied minors are linking up with other unaccompanied illegal aliens and they're saying they're a family unit.
[00:15:53.298 --> 00:15:57.300]  I mean, that's just the potential for all sorts of trafficking issues.
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:08.483]  Now, Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman believes federal authorities are conducting secret operations by sending immigrant children into states without the knowledge of state officials.
[00:16:08.823 --> 00:16:14.505]  He says, we want to know the names of those individuals, who is their sponsor, is their sponsor legal?
[00:16:15.325 --> 00:16:16.948]  What communities did you send them to?
[00:16:17.428 --> 00:16:19.852]  Why are they conducting a secret operation?
[00:16:20.212 --> 00:16:26.261]  Essentially, they're being transported all over the country and the federal government won't tell us what's going on.
[00:16:26.641 --> 00:16:30.867]  Hyman also called out this most transparent administration ever.
[00:16:31.388 --> 00:16:33.350]  Saying, what are they hiding?
[00:16:33.731 --> 00:16:39.937]  Now, it is estimated that more than 150,000 unaccompanied minor children will be entering the country by 2015.
[00:16:40.337 --> 00:16:42.279]  Now, this is up from a little over 6,000 and just reported in 2012.
[00:16:48.886 --> 00:16:52.670]  Now, we have all heard about the emergency alert system.
[00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:55.233]  We've all seen it scrolling on our TV sets.
[00:16:55.673 --> 00:16:57.916]  Well, it has just been given an upgrade.
[00:16:58.316 --> 00:17:08.367]  What was normally reserved for your local radio and TV stations is now going to be able to reach the entire country with the flip of a switch.
[00:17:08.787 --> 00:17:11.170]  The president can speak to the entire country
[00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:16.493]  In the event of a nationwide emergency with just pushing a single button.
[00:17:16.974 --> 00:17:22.357]  Now Alex Jones reported on these FEMA boxes in Police State 2000.
[00:17:22.738 --> 00:17:28.582]  But now he's going to talk about this upgrade and breaks down the power of the kill switch.
[00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:41.955]  Alex Jones here to break down some exciting developments in the area of research concerning supplemental iodine.
[00:17:42.596 --> 00:17:44.737]  It's nothing less than phenomenal.
[00:17:45.318 --> 00:17:51.603]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:17:51.863 --> 00:17:55.826]  And I used some of the mainline iodine supplements and they upset my stomach and I had some issues with it.
[00:17:56.326 --> 00:18:06.614]  Until I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group, who I was already interviewing as an expert on my radio show, and I began taking the product before he actually rolled it out.
[00:18:07.075 --> 00:18:12.379]  You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:18:13.119 --> 00:18:20.925]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:18:21.966 --> 00:18:31.912]  That are incredibly powerful that no one else has as a source for their iodine from between 7 and 12,000 feet literally drilled out of the ground.
[00:18:32.452 --> 00:18:37.536]  You put it on a hot plate and it turns into the pure gas.
[00:18:37.736 --> 00:18:40.978]  No one else has 99.99% pure iodine.
[00:18:42.418 --> 00:18:46.221]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:18:46.861 --> 00:18:48.342]  I was over 270 pounds.
[00:18:50.123 --> 00:18:59.171]  And with the iodine, exercise, and better diet, I have lost now more than 50 pounds total and I'm continuing to lose the weight.
[00:18:59.511 --> 00:19:03.655]  I have more energy, my libido, all this crap came out of my skin.
[00:19:04.195 --> 00:19:05.656]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:19:05.696 --> 00:19:07.057]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:19:07.338 --> 00:19:08.459]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:19:08.999 --> 00:19:09.680]  Nobody else.
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.743]  ...has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:14.083 --> 00:19:14.964]  This is innovating.
[00:19:15.365 --> 00:19:16.385]  This is trailblazing.
[00:19:16.806 --> 00:19:24.112]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:19:24.332 --> 00:19:28.436]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:19:28.616 --> 00:19:33.821]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:19:42.392 --> 00:19:52.821]  And finally tonight on Infowars at Nightly News, I want to break down a story that showed up in headlines across the country and even as far away as England tonight.
[00:19:53.361 --> 00:19:58.285]  New alert system gives President special code for emergency messages.
[00:19:58.706 --> 00:19:59.707]  That's out of the hill.
[00:20:00.347 --> 00:20:09.337]  The Daily Mail got it right saying new emergency alert system will give Obama the power to flip a switch and address the entire nation at once.
[00:20:09.658 --> 00:20:13.762]  The Washington Post described it as something out of George Orwell's 1984.
[00:20:17.066 --> 00:20:37.001]  I'm one of the first people in the United States to start warning of this as far back as 1996 because broadcast engineers in radio stations that I was working in had been part of a Texas Association of Broadcast Meetings where the feds, under Clinton's orders, were preparing to have it ready by 1999
[00:20:39.022 --> 00:20:52.436]  So Bill Clinton could start overriding radio and TV broadcast, VHF, UHF, AM, FM, and be able to force his messages onto the air like something out of the old Soviet Union.
[00:20:52.776 --> 00:20:55.919]  A literal broadcast kill switch is what it did.
[00:20:56.179 --> 00:20:57.381]  It didn't allow the stations
[00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:09.441]  To tune to an emergency channel to put the president on, it had it where the systems couldn't work and were overridden by federal pieces of equipment at the tower and at the broadcast site.
[00:21:10.221 --> 00:21:18.104]  And I interviewed on air, changing their voices, multiple broadcast engineers, one of them very high level up.
[00:21:18.664 --> 00:21:23.590]  And since then, in films like Police State 2000, I exposed it in 1999.
[00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:31.779]  Now, in previous reports in the last 19 years, we've broken down the evil authoritarian applications of all of these systems.
[00:21:31.859 --> 00:21:34.362]  But I want to recap some of those for you now.
[00:21:35.063 --> 00:21:43.808]  This allows the state to begin the process of openly having state-run media, not just covertly funding the dinosaur media.
[00:21:44.048 --> 00:21:50.772]  And the Pentagon got the law changed last year to be able to engage in domestic deception or PSYOPs here in the United States.
[00:21:51.332 --> 00:21:55.855]  But its real intention is to be able to cut off anything embarrassing
[00:21:56.915 --> 00:22:05.882]  Like Rand Paul and his filibuster being cut off across the world and across the United States in channels carrying U.S.
[00:22:05.962 --> 00:22:09.785]  media when he was engaged in his filibuster.
[00:22:10.686 --> 00:22:12.067]  That's what this is all about.
[00:22:12.527 --> 00:22:14.228]  Again, even the Washington Post
[00:22:14.949 --> 00:22:20.353]  Well, we have linked here in our article from 2011, described it as something out of Orwell's 1984.
[00:22:21.133 --> 00:22:23.935]  This was already in place by then.
[00:22:24.435 --> 00:22:29.619]  It was in place in the late 90s, but expanded to be on smartphones, all computers, you name it.
[00:22:30.019 --> 00:22:34.162]  My phone, my Apple iPhone 5, that's really a portable computer,
[00:22:35.649 --> 00:22:38.835]  Turns on now when the Obama alerts come in.
[00:22:39.155 --> 00:22:41.980]  And it's always about hurricanes or floods, something reasonable.
[00:22:42.261 --> 00:22:43.383]  But that could be done locally.
[00:22:43.964 --> 00:22:46.328]  It's setting the precedent.
[00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:52.034]  So that people get accustomed to it so we can begin to get the political messages.
[00:22:52.595 --> 00:23:08.429]  It was floated by the Association of Broadcasters nationally and right here in Texas back in 1996-97 that again there would be government programming, not just PSAs, routinely overriding hours a day.
[00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:14.816]  And that's what had the association so upset, and so they were able to get some of it backed off.
[00:23:15.136 --> 00:23:17.999]  That is not the case now.
[00:23:18.559 --> 00:23:28.609]  The feds are pushing for digital license plates that only cost a few dollars, the technology's gotten so cheap, that have messages about who's wanted and images of people on your license plates.
[00:23:28.989 --> 00:23:33.534]  This is the Minority Report Brave New World, and here's the big issue tonight.
[00:23:34.966 --> 00:23:38.709]  We have now come to the point where more and more of these alerts are being issued.
[00:23:39.569 --> 00:24:03.306]  We've now come to the point where they are clearly moving from the preparation phase to the operational phase, right as they start wars with Russia, right as they turn Al-Qaeda and ISIS loose worldwide, right as they announce your kids don't belong to you, and as they open up the borders and begin to collapse the states, right as Obamacare comes into place, right as their entire agenda
[00:24:04.301 --> 00:24:05.102]  Clicks into gear.
[00:24:05.683 --> 00:24:07.124]  Obama is their closer.
[00:24:07.705 --> 00:24:11.009]  Like in the final inning of a baseball game, the closing pitcher.
[00:24:11.349 --> 00:24:13.531]  That's his position.
[00:24:13.772 --> 00:24:15.053]  That's why he is in.
[00:24:16.198 --> 00:24:18.059]  The position he is in today.
[00:24:18.639 --> 00:24:23.840]  We as a people, we as a world, have to realize the critical juncture in history we're in.
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:35.763]  William Binney, one of the most high-level NSA people to ever go public, number four in the agency, went public to the London Guardian last Sunday and said it's about total authoritarian totalitarian control.
[00:24:36.084 --> 00:24:39.484]  He used the word population control totalitarianism.
[00:24:39.885 --> 00:24:40.705]  Total control.
[00:24:41.838 --> 00:24:44.280]  Admit we're going into tyranny, we have a chance to beat it.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.282]  A lot of you say, I don't care if there's tyranny, I'll go along with it.
[00:24:47.963 --> 00:24:54.227]  They only set a tyranny up, ladies and gentlemen, so they can take your pension funds.
[00:24:54.247 --> 00:24:56.929]  They're announcing bail-ins all over Europe and the US.
[00:24:56.949 --> 00:24:58.651]  We're going to start taking money out of your bank account.
[00:24:59.151 --> 00:25:05.594]  This is being put into place as they get ready to drop the hammer and break the back of this country once and for all.
[00:25:06.234 --> 00:25:10.696]  Well, again, that's it for this edition of InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:25:11.297 --> 00:25:16.939]  Lord willing, we'll be back tomorrow night, 7 o'clock central, right here at InfoWarsNews.com.
[00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:22.802]  For myself, Alex Jones, Leanne McAdoo, and the rest of the great crew that hosted and produced the show tonight,
[00:25:23.542 --> 00:25:27.046]  If you're watching this transmission, my friends, you're just as important as we are.
[00:25:27.406 --> 00:25:28.868]  You are the resistance.
[00:25:34.874 --> 00:25:43.723]  I got a chance to meet Ari Shaffir, I don't know, eight, nine years ago, because I'm friends with Joe Rogan, and he was touring with Joe at the time, and has off and on over the years.
[00:25:45.337 --> 00:25:47.318]  And he's really a shock comic.
[00:25:47.338 --> 00:25:48.879]  He's a very nice guy behind the scenes.
[00:25:49.319 --> 00:25:50.680]  Some of what he says I think is very funny.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.941]  Some of it is really groundbreaking and how obnoxious it is.
[00:25:54.702 --> 00:25:58.264]  But he definitely stands out and is a very bold person.
[00:25:58.884 --> 00:26:05.967]  He's the type of guy who has a alter ego character called the Amazing Racist who goes out and just pulls ridiculous stunts.
[00:26:06.488 --> 00:26:07.988]  And I kind of like it because
[00:26:09.709 --> 00:26:15.573]  It throws humor in the face of political correctness and breaks a lot of taboos, but it also upsets a lot of people.
[00:26:15.854 --> 00:26:18.415]  Look at this version of the video.
[00:26:18.495 --> 00:26:19.716]  It has 941,000 views.
[00:26:20.337 --> 00:26:23.679]  There's tens of millions of views of this video total if you add them all up together.
[00:26:24.179 --> 00:26:26.021]  And he's driving around in California.
[00:26:26.821 --> 00:26:42.396]  He goes up to a Home Depot type of store and picks up a bunch of day laborers and then drives them to the ICE agency and has them basically jumping out of the vehicle.
[00:26:43.749 --> 00:26:45.150]  Now, a lot of folks got offended by that.
[00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:51.734]  But the issue is, he was simply playing that from the perspective of a quote, racist.
[00:26:52.194 --> 00:26:58.918]  Well, I would expand on that and say, why is it racist to deport people from this country?
[00:26:59.158 --> 00:27:00.839]  Because MSNBC says so?
[00:27:01.399 --> 00:27:05.602]  There are seven billion people plus outside this country, most of them living in total squalor.
[00:27:05.882 --> 00:27:11.766]  And while I have empathy and humanity for them, if we're a lifeboat that can hold ten people, we can't hold a thousand.
[00:27:12.506 --> 00:27:17.252]  And when these groups are put on welfare and our country's going bankrupt, we can't afford to pay for it.
[00:27:17.652 --> 00:27:29.546]  But the reason I wanted to replay this clip here at the end of the nightly news in overdrive tonight of the amazing racist character with Ari Shaffir is because
[00:27:30.743 --> 00:27:36.687]  It was funny to have him drive them to the ICE station four or five years ago when this video first came out.
[00:27:37.408 --> 00:27:54.039]  But now it's not funny because Obama has ICE and the Border Patrol as the red carpet delivery agency completing the smuggling cycle, as members of the Border Patrol have said, to bring these people deep into the United States and to basically legalize them by fiat.
[00:27:54.479 --> 00:27:58.042]  So even if you think we should open our borders to tens of millions of more people,
[00:27:59.758 --> 00:28:06.962]  This sets the precedent where the executive branch can dictatorially do whatever it wants and suspend laws without Congress.
[00:28:06.982 --> 00:28:10.364]  So it's a very dangerous precedent across the board.
[00:28:10.705 --> 00:28:15.848]  So here from the archives is some clips of the amazing racist
[00:28:16.708 --> 00:28:19.389]  On Mexicans is what the video is called.
[00:28:19.729 --> 00:28:34.513]  And then we're going to come back with an interview done last year by one of our great graphics guys and news producers, who's a big fan of him, Marcos Morales, who went down to the Austin Comedy Club to do an exclusive behind-the-scenes interview with Ari Shaffir.
[00:28:34.753 --> 00:28:42.795]  And then we're going to post this from the Nightly News tomorrow in an article at InfoWars.com, and we can have a larger debate about humor, political correctness,
[00:28:43.355 --> 00:28:44.016]  Uh, and more.
[00:28:44.296 --> 00:28:52.302]  But I don't care if you're black, white, hispanic, or whatever you are, a human being, I think this is very funny, even though it is disturbing.
[00:28:52.742 --> 00:28:54.744]  Uh, so, uh, again, here is Ari Shaffir.
[00:28:56.425 --> 00:28:57.586]  They're all over there looking for work.
[00:28:57.606 --> 00:28:59.548]  There's none of them here, like, legally.
[00:28:59.568 --> 00:29:04.191]  So what we're gonna do is we're gonna go over there and fuck with them a little bit.
[00:29:04.211 --> 00:29:06.373]  Look, just look at them over there, just standing there.
[00:29:07.494 --> 00:29:08.074]  Like animals.
[00:29:08.594 --> 00:29:09.715]  Oh, let me work, let me work.
[00:29:09.735 --> 00:29:11.577]  I feel like the crocodile hunter.
[00:29:13.729 --> 00:29:15.290]  Hopefully one of them will speak English.
[00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:18.651]  Otherwise, I don't know how to communicate with them.
[00:29:18.671 --> 00:29:20.751]  This is gonna be fun.
[00:29:21.932 --> 00:29:24.192]  Hey, how you guys doing?
[00:29:24.252 --> 00:29:25.073]  You looking for some workers?
[00:29:25.253 --> 00:29:25.853]  Yes, we are.
[00:29:25.893 --> 00:29:26.193]  How much?
[00:29:26.373 --> 00:29:27.093]  I am.
[00:29:28.013 --> 00:29:29.414]  About 60 bucks for the day.
[00:29:29.534 --> 00:29:29.794]  Okay.
[00:29:29.854 --> 00:29:30.394]  Is that good?
[00:29:30.894 --> 00:29:32.215]  I need you guys to build it.
[00:29:33.897 --> 00:29:34.618]  Yeah, okay.
[00:29:35.078 --> 00:29:35.538]  Good job.
[00:29:35.938 --> 00:29:37.119]  I need help to build a deck.
[00:29:37.439 --> 00:29:37.860]  Does that work?
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:39.361]  I'll take all you guys.
[00:29:39.841 --> 00:29:40.361]  Yeah, just hop in.
[00:29:40.401 --> 00:29:40.902]  Just hop in.
[00:29:40.922 --> 00:29:41.382]  Oh, no, no.
[00:29:41.402 --> 00:29:41.862]  Not in the front.
[00:29:41.882 --> 00:29:42.503]  I just washed the cab.
[00:29:42.563 --> 00:29:43.784]  I need you guys to get in the back.
[00:29:43.804 --> 00:29:44.284]  Yeah, you can't.
[00:29:44.324 --> 00:29:44.464]  Yeah.
[00:30:04.982 --> 00:30:05.863]  Settle down, you guys.
[00:30:06.203 --> 00:30:09.244]  I'm just gonna close this on you.
[00:30:09.924 --> 00:30:10.885]  Now we have five.
[00:30:11.105 --> 00:30:13.026]  We're gonna go over speed bump.
[00:30:13.126 --> 00:30:13.606]  Watch him.
[00:30:17.748 --> 00:30:18.568]  Hold on, Beaners!
[00:30:19.289 --> 00:30:20.209]  Sorry about that.
[00:30:20.229 --> 00:30:21.030]  I didn't see it.
[00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:22.290]  I didn't see the bump.
[00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:24.091]  There's another one.
[00:30:24.191 --> 00:30:24.611]  I'm sorry.
[00:30:24.851 --> 00:30:25.151]  Sorry.
[00:30:26.132 --> 00:30:29.233]  The great thing about Beaners is they are always willing to work.
[00:30:29.473 --> 00:30:29.794]  Always.
[00:30:30.534 --> 00:30:31.174]  That's what they're good at.
[00:30:31.194 --> 00:30:32.655]  They're good at working and having babies.
[00:30:34.261 --> 00:30:37.042]  They think they're coming over to my house to fix my deck.
[00:30:37.622 --> 00:30:39.523]  What they don't know is that we're not going to my house.
[00:30:39.643 --> 00:30:40.503]  We're going somewhere else.
[00:30:41.344 --> 00:30:43.404]  I'm not going to ruin the surprise, but we'll be there in a minute.
[00:30:44.125 --> 00:30:47.866]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[00:30:47.906 --> 00:30:49.627]  Sorry, it just worked.
[00:30:50.307 --> 00:30:50.467]  Sorry.
[00:30:50.487 --> 00:30:52.468]  You guys okay?
[00:30:52.888 --> 00:30:53.648]  Okay, yeah.
[00:30:54.248 --> 00:30:55.529]  I don't know what the fuck you just said.
[00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:57.089]  Macarilla!
[00:30:57.109 --> 00:30:57.950]  Something like that.
[00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:58.550]  I don't know.
[00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:00.250]  We're almost there.
[00:31:00.991 --> 00:31:01.571]  Get ready for this.
[00:31:06.028 --> 00:31:09.730]  There it is!
[00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:11.711]  There it is!
[00:31:11.751 --> 00:31:12.552]  La Migra!
[00:31:12.792 --> 00:31:15.113]  La Migra!
[00:31:15.293 --> 00:31:16.574]  The 6-7 right here!
[00:31:16.994 --> 00:31:17.734]  I got him!
[00:31:18.555 --> 00:31:19.255]  I got him!
[00:31:19.315 --> 00:31:20.196]  That's so much fun!
[00:31:36.806 --> 00:31:45.250]  Please give a huge round of applause for the very hilarious, the reason we're all here, Mr. Ari Shaffir, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:31:57.293 --> 00:31:59.135]  I've been in comedy for almost 15 years.
[00:31:59.155 --> 00:32:00.056]  14 and a half years.
[00:32:00.356 --> 00:32:01.817]  I usually, I go to Canada a lot.
[00:32:01.837 --> 00:32:03.258]  I don't really leave the country that much.
[00:32:03.278 --> 00:32:06.461]  I went to Australia about a month ago.
[00:32:07.162 --> 00:32:07.762]  That was cool.
[00:32:08.003 --> 00:32:09.384]  And I went to Cabo, Mexico.
[00:32:10.024 --> 00:32:10.765]  But those don't count.
[00:32:11.386 --> 00:32:12.527]  Mexico and Canada don't count.
[00:32:12.907 --> 00:32:14.228]  If they say, are you opting out?
[00:32:14.448 --> 00:32:15.930]  I say, I don't know what that means.
[00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:17.111]  And they say, do you not want that?
[00:32:17.191 --> 00:32:17.851]  Or do you want a pat down?
[00:32:17.871 --> 00:32:19.273]  I go, no, I don't want a pat down.
[00:32:19.373 --> 00:32:20.274]  But I'm not doing that thing.
[00:32:20.894 --> 00:32:21.495]  So what are my options?
[00:32:21.515 --> 00:32:22.896]  Are you just trying to be Larry David?
[00:32:23.096 --> 00:32:28.281]  No, I'm just trying to not let them take away these freedoms from me without going down with a little bit of a fight.
[00:32:28.641 --> 00:32:29.442]  I see what they're doing.
[00:32:29.462 --> 00:32:30.583]  They're just harassing us.
[00:32:31.044 --> 00:32:32.725]  And I don't want to just let them do it.
[00:32:32.745 --> 00:32:35.908]  This one joke I have, I asked them to raise their hand if you support the government right now.
[00:32:35.928 --> 00:32:37.350]  I think that was the only time I've done it like that.
[00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:40.052]  I just figure Austin's kind of a political town.
[00:32:40.613 --> 00:32:44.356]  So I bet, you know, I just kind of want to get a sense of like, how much is it right now?
[00:32:44.376 --> 00:32:45.858]  Because sometimes you get a few people clapping.
[00:32:46.894 --> 00:32:48.996]  Oh yeah, you can.
[00:33:02.634 --> 00:33:03.454]  She was like, I don't know.
[00:33:04.055 --> 00:33:04.535]  He just did.
[00:33:04.555 --> 00:33:05.795]  He told them secrets.
[00:33:05.815 --> 00:33:06.415]  I'm like, who?
[00:33:06.516 --> 00:33:07.336]  That they were spying on us.
[00:33:08.136 --> 00:33:08.956]  She's like, well, no.
[00:33:09.777 --> 00:33:10.257]  It hurts us.
[00:33:10.277 --> 00:33:14.338]  And I'm like, what news story are you going to point to exactly that justifies that?
[00:33:15.019 --> 00:33:16.059]  And she just sort of buys it.
[00:33:16.079 --> 00:33:17.840]  It's just like, here's, I don't know, I heard it on the news.
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:23.462]  I mean, the idea of having debates would strengthen us, but I don't think having polarizing views helps us at all.
[00:33:23.862 --> 00:33:25.663]  I think it's just like, well, you guys break off and do your...
[00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:27.251]  We're nothing like you.
[00:33:27.651 --> 00:33:29.312]  It's like gay people want to be part of the church.
[00:33:29.352 --> 00:33:30.513]  It's like, what are you talking about?
[00:33:30.573 --> 00:33:31.514]  They don't like you.
[00:33:32.194 --> 00:33:33.235]  They don't want you there.
[00:33:33.635 --> 00:33:35.216]  Stop trying to get them to accept you.
[00:33:35.276 --> 00:33:36.197]  Just do your own thing.
[00:33:36.937 --> 00:33:43.982]  Yeah, I think those people that want to love Jesus and all that, and the heartland, and do whatever they want to do, the real conservative people, it's like, go do your own thing.
[00:33:44.022 --> 00:33:45.203]  No, it doesn't help us get anywhere.
[00:33:45.624 --> 00:33:47.225]  People are like, you've got to respect other people's religions.
[00:33:47.245 --> 00:33:47.885]  I'm like, why?
[00:33:48.045 --> 00:33:49.506]  You're supposed to disrespect their religion.
[00:33:49.546 --> 00:33:53.089]  That's what it means to believe in your God, that you don't believe in their God.
[00:33:53.129 --> 00:33:54.470]  You think it's silly and stupid.
[00:33:55.819 --> 00:33:56.219]  It's cool.
[00:33:56.239 --> 00:33:59.402]  You want to smoke weed in your apartment?
[00:33:59.883 --> 00:34:00.183]  Do it.
[00:34:00.603 --> 00:34:04.327]  If you want to, as a government, say we don't think weed should be legal, it's like, alright, that's fine.
[00:34:04.567 --> 00:34:06.349]  But you can't take away my freedom.
[00:34:06.689 --> 00:34:10.853]  You can't make me surrender my freedom because I lit up a joint in my bathroom while I'm taking a dump.
[00:34:10.873 --> 00:34:13.956]  Do I have to not be free for a year after that?
[00:34:15.377 --> 00:34:16.718]  I don't understand how that's helping anything.
[00:34:17.935 --> 00:34:21.017]  Put heavy taxes on it, something like that, if you want to get rid of it.
[00:34:21.678 --> 00:34:23.379]  It doesn't go away when you make something illegal.
[00:34:23.399 --> 00:34:24.059]  It doesn't go away.
[00:34:24.079 --> 00:34:25.820]  It's like murder never goes away.
[00:34:26.661 --> 00:34:31.044]  Yeah, all the war on drugs, I mean, everybody kind of knows the ways, but everyone still feels like they have to fight it.
[00:34:31.644 --> 00:34:33.745]  They still have to feel like, well, we can't just let it go rampant.
[00:34:34.186 --> 00:34:35.707]  But it's like, you know what they did in Portugal?
[00:34:35.747 --> 00:34:36.928]  They legalized all drugs.
[00:34:37.448 --> 00:34:44.553]  They took the exact amount of dollars they were spending on the drug war in Portugal, and they put that exact money into treatment, into drug treatment.
[00:34:45.501 --> 00:34:48.084]  So just like alcoholics, some people can drink booze.
[00:34:48.284 --> 00:34:48.884]  Most people can.
[00:34:49.245 --> 00:34:51.227]  But some people become alcoholics and they can't treat it.
[00:34:51.807 --> 00:34:52.928]  We need to help them with treatment.
[00:34:53.469 --> 00:34:54.670]  That's what it means to reach out.
[00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:55.591]  We don't have to make it illegal.
[00:34:55.611 --> 00:34:57.673]  It doesn't go away when you make it illegal.
[00:34:57.753 --> 00:34:58.694]  So same thing with drugs.
[00:34:58.874 --> 00:35:05.400]  Most people can... Dude, I know I got told when I was young, if you do coke you're going to lose your family and your house and your wife and job.
[00:35:06.061 --> 00:35:07.443]  But, and it stuck with me.
[00:35:07.483 --> 00:35:08.784]  I'm not really a coke guy because of that.
[00:35:08.804 --> 00:35:09.565]  I've done it like twice.
[00:35:10.005 --> 00:35:13.109]  But, I have all these friends who do coke all the time, and they're fine.
[00:35:13.369 --> 00:35:14.190]  They're getting ahead.
[00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:15.331]  They're doing well.
[00:35:15.732 --> 00:35:18.955]  So it's like, it's not gone, and it's not the thing you told us.
[00:35:19.616 --> 00:35:21.878]  So for the people who can't handle it, yeah, get treatment.
[00:35:21.918 --> 00:35:22.979]  Get education ahead of time.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.781]  This might be addictive for you.
[00:35:25.899 --> 00:35:27.780]  Yeah, well of course you should use it as a treatment.
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:30.382]  The problem is now you can't research it because it's illegal to have.
[00:35:30.982 --> 00:35:34.665]  So you can't even do the research in order to show that it's good.
[00:35:34.705 --> 00:35:35.485]  You can't get any funding.
[00:35:35.505 --> 00:35:36.326]  You can't do it publicly.
[00:35:36.346 --> 00:35:37.927]  You have to go to another country to do that research.
[00:35:38.648 --> 00:35:40.709]  Like small amounts of research have helped, have shown.
[00:35:40.769 --> 00:35:51.936]  John Hopkins had a study that showed it like psilocybin relieves stress and depression and gives people among the five most spiritual moments of their lives.
[00:35:52.697 --> 00:35:55.139]  And so it's like, should we not even continue to research it?
[00:35:56.439 --> 00:35:57.984]  Well, just see, maybe we got it wrong.
[00:35:58.004 --> 00:35:59.989]  Maybe we lumped something in.
[00:36:00.029 --> 00:36:01.473]  People are like, oh, mushrooms are drugs.
[00:36:01.513 --> 00:36:02.135]  No, they're not.
[00:36:02.175 --> 00:36:02.957]  That's not drugs.
[00:36:03.399 --> 00:36:04.040]  Meth is drugs.
[00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:08.292]  A lot of people do political comedy, and I've almost always seen it done wrong.
[00:36:08.733 --> 00:36:10.554]  They lose the idea of being funny.
[00:36:10.994 --> 00:36:13.996]  Bill Hicks was completely unfunny when he was doing this political stuff.
[00:36:14.517 --> 00:36:18.019]  He completely just ignored the idea of laughs.
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:21.882]  All the best clips that everybody quotes me, there's two laughs in seven minutes.
[00:36:22.562 --> 00:36:23.123]  There's nothing there.
[00:36:23.163 --> 00:36:24.144]  Doug Stano does it well.
[00:36:24.684 --> 00:36:25.885]  Doug Stano never forgets that.
[00:36:26.405 --> 00:36:29.347]  He'll continue to talk about his point, but he'll make jokes throughout.
[00:36:29.387 --> 00:36:30.908]  He doesn't go 30 seconds without a joke.
[00:36:30.928 --> 00:36:33.010]  He definitely doesn't go four minutes without one.
[00:36:34.261 --> 00:36:35.221]  Yeah, Stan Hope does it well.
[00:36:35.241 --> 00:36:37.863]  This guy Dave Smith in New York is doing it well.
[00:36:38.543 --> 00:36:39.683]  Real libertarian comic.
[00:36:40.264 --> 00:36:43.025]  But a lot of times comics just preach at you.
[00:36:43.485 --> 00:36:49.587]  They just do stuff like this, like, well, of course the Fed was built in 1962, what do you think happens?
[00:36:50.088 --> 00:36:51.408]  And people are like, I don't know what that means.
[00:36:52.008 --> 00:36:54.409]  So this isn't a joke, you're just yelling.
[00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:56.410]  You can make points too, but make jokes.
[00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:57.911]  That's your first thing.
[00:36:59.765 --> 00:37:01.586]  Yeah, here or there.
[00:37:02.126 --> 00:37:02.667]  Absolutely.
[00:37:03.007 --> 00:37:04.148]  You get somebody else's point of view.
[00:37:04.168 --> 00:37:07.069]  I had on my special, I had this anti, like, family stuff.
[00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:08.450]  Like, I don't want kids.
[00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:11.412]  And I feel like I got my point across in a way to make a joke.
[00:37:11.452 --> 00:37:16.635]  And it's like, hey, it might not be for you to have no kids ever, but you'll hear it.
[00:37:16.675 --> 00:37:17.476]  Maybe it's an option.
[00:37:18.493 --> 00:37:24.796]  You know, if you're 22, maybe you'll hear, like, oh, maybe I don't have to think in terms of, like, success is only having a wife and child.
[00:37:25.276 --> 00:37:26.417]  Maybe success is something different.
[00:37:27.277 --> 00:37:29.058]  People can relate to you on anything you do.
[00:37:29.438 --> 00:37:38.323]  So, if you say, like, I wet my bed, or whatever, you know, the bedwetters will relate to you, but also people who went through, like, insecurities will relate to you.
[00:37:38.403 --> 00:37:39.943]  People who overcame hurdles will relate to you.
[00:37:40.564 --> 00:37:41.444]  You know, same sort of thing.
[00:37:41.464 --> 00:37:43.505]  Yeah, people can learn from other people's experiences, of course.
[00:37:43.965 --> 00:37:45.186]  Yeah, that's why Hemingway went to war.
[00:37:46.189 --> 00:37:48.275]  You know, he wasn't writing to just veterans.
[00:37:48.496 --> 00:37:50.823]  He was writing to the normal person, but he was like, you'll relate to it.
[00:37:52.369 --> 00:37:54.350]  Any kind of art, people, anything that's out there.
[00:37:54.771 --> 00:37:59.033]  So it's constantly, like I told you, I don't know how you relate to politics, but you can, totally.
[00:37:59.394 --> 00:38:06.298]  But like, when I go anti-children and stuff, the reason people have that idea, it's like, this is, I have to have a family, is because romantic comedies.
[00:38:06.778 --> 00:38:11.802]  Because it always works out, and that's what your ideal is, and you keep trying to strive for that, because that's in media.
[00:38:12.102 --> 00:38:13.743]  That's in entertainment, constantly.
[00:38:14.123 --> 00:38:14.984]  Even sitcoms.
[00:38:15.344 --> 00:38:19.187]  Except for Seinfeld, and even they tried that first year, where Larry David had to quit over it.
[00:38:19.567 --> 00:38:20.928]  Larry David had to quit Seinfeld.
[00:38:21.408 --> 00:38:24.391]  Because he was like, Elaine and Jerry are not supposed to get together.
[00:38:24.451 --> 00:38:25.512]  We're not doing that show.
[00:38:25.973 --> 00:38:28.696]  And they were like, no, we just think, you know, it's a natural, that's how shows work.
[00:38:28.716 --> 00:38:29.357]  He goes, no!
[00:38:29.797 --> 00:38:30.558]  It's ridiculous.
[00:38:30.578 --> 00:38:31.799]  People are going to just be friends.
[00:38:33.061 --> 00:38:34.442]  And that's just never shown.
[00:38:34.462 --> 00:38:38.226]  And so the more you show it, the more it becomes acceptable to you and your friends.
[00:38:38.246 --> 00:38:39.448]  They're like, yeah, it's done.
[00:38:39.468 --> 00:38:41.109]  I went on an anonymous march.
[00:38:42.028 --> 00:38:44.530]  In L.A., they had the, uh, a million mask march.
[00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:45.871]  It was great.
[00:38:46.531 --> 00:38:47.852]  But nobody gets the message, though.
[00:38:48.472 --> 00:38:49.033]  Nobody hears it.
[00:38:49.073 --> 00:38:51.094]  When you go by people, they look at you and they're like, oh, what's that?
[00:38:51.154 --> 00:38:52.335]  Oh, it's Muslims and Hamas people.
[00:38:52.355 --> 00:38:55.337]  And maybe a couple people go, well, let me look at that.
[00:38:55.357 --> 00:38:56.297]  And they find out what it is.
[00:38:56.417 --> 00:38:56.758]  But no.
[00:38:56.878 --> 00:38:57.418]  Everyone just leaves.
[00:38:57.618 --> 00:38:58.519]  There's someone protesting.
[00:38:58.779 --> 00:39:00.140]  Same thing I do when I hear honks.
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:00.620]  Somebody posts.
[00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:01.941]  I'm like, I just, I don't take it in.
[00:39:02.541 --> 00:39:03.442]  I don't think, what's the message?
[00:39:03.462 --> 00:39:04.723]  And they just yell, wake up!
[00:39:05.203 --> 00:39:05.663]  Wake up!
[00:39:05.703 --> 00:39:08.005]  And it's like, yeah, maybe they should, but that ain't gonna do it.
[00:39:08.025 --> 00:39:09.646]  That ain't gonna accomplish what you're doing.
[00:39:10.286 --> 00:39:10.827]  And honestly,
[00:39:12.773 --> 00:39:14.214]  I don't even know what you're trying to accomplish anyway.
[00:39:14.294 --> 00:39:15.315]  Let's say everybody wakes up.
[00:39:15.615 --> 00:39:19.617]  Let's say everybody wakes up and they know the government is completely corrupt and it's all just Game of Thrones.
[00:39:20.078 --> 00:39:21.779]  It's all the same shit as it's always been.
[00:39:22.639 --> 00:39:28.803]  And they know that the Fed controls everything and they've assassinated every president or tried to assassinate every president that's ever questioned the Fed.
[00:39:29.163 --> 00:39:30.304]  Then what if we all wake up?
[00:39:30.644 --> 00:39:31.565]  We're still powerless.
[00:39:32.025 --> 00:39:35.507]  We still can't... By saying, I want to change, that's not going to make a change.
[00:39:35.947 --> 00:39:36.428]  That's not.
[00:39:37.168 --> 00:39:37.970]  There's one way.
[00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:40.317]  There's one way to make regime change in any country.
[00:39:40.357 --> 00:39:41.399]  And we all know what it is.
[00:39:41.419 --> 00:39:42.643]  It's not through voting.
[00:39:42.683 --> 00:39:43.565]  It's not through waking up.
[00:39:43.966 --> 00:39:44.708]  We all know what it is.
