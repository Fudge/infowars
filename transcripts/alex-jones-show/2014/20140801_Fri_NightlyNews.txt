[00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:21.524]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.584 --> 00:00:25.487]  It is Friday, August 1st, 2014, and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:25.607 --> 00:00:26.608]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:36.297]  Tonight, the American people shout down the GOP leadership on immigration, melting down the Capitol Hill phone lines.
[00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:41.681]  Then, will a pandemic or the threat of one be used to create martial law?
[00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:42.342]  And,
[00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.192]  9-1-1, what's your emergency?
[00:00:46.492 --> 00:00:48.275]  It's my ex who's trying to break in.
[00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:51.378]  Anti-Second Amendment ad backfires.
[00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.642]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:56.081 --> 00:00:56.921]  You just broke in the door.
[00:00:56.941 --> 00:00:57.702]  You need to come now.
[00:00:58.482 --> 00:01:03.164]  Well, Congress was set to vote on House Speaker John Boehner's border bill yesterday.
[00:01:03.184 --> 00:01:15.648]  It was a bill that most there in Congress thought was going to actually do more harm than good, but they wanted to vote on something, so it seemed like they were doing anything to help this immigration crisis before their five-week vacation.
[00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.869]  However...
[00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:34.523]  America called in, melted down the phone lines on Capitol Hill, demanded their voices to be heard, and then this led to leading conservatives sitting down with representatives of the House leadership to go ahead and hammer out the outline of a revised plan, take it back to the bargaining table.
[00:01:35.103 --> 00:01:40.725]  Now this was largely due to Tea Party conservatives expressing concerns on three main topics.
[00:01:41.165 --> 00:01:46.987]  The Deferred Action for Children Arrivals Policy, the 2008 Wilberforce Law, and Asylum.
[00:01:47.347 --> 00:01:54.090]  Now Representative Michelle Bachman said that there was no question it was the power of the grassroots pressure on moderates
[00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.731]  That forced, going back to the bargaining table, working on this revised plan.
[00:01:59.171 --> 00:02:08.293]  So it just goes to show the power that we do have when we raise our voices, demand our voices be heard, and a simple phone call calling in to your representatives.
[00:02:08.714 --> 00:02:22.077]  Now Congress has planned to stay late on Friday to go ahead and vote on this revised plan, but of course it's kind of playing politics because nothing can really happen with this since the Senate has already adjourned.
[00:02:22.717 --> 00:02:34.965]  So basically what the Republicans are hoping is that by them passing this bill or voting on this bill, that it's going to put the pressure now on the Senate and say, see, you guys didn't do anything before you went on vacation.
[00:02:35.986 --> 00:02:41.530]  But of course, Democrats just probably adjourned knowing that Obama was going to go ahead and use his pen anyway.
[00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:55.357]  Now while Congress is going to be out on vacation for five weeks, this continual flow of illegal immigrants is just continuing to rush the border and we actually have exclusive footage down there at Karnes City, Texas today.
[00:02:55.877 --> 00:03:00.060]  They are already being bused into their new detention facility that has
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:10.605]  Beautiful flat screen TVs and barber shops and swimming pools and all sorts of lovely amenities for these residents of the suites.
[00:03:11.065 --> 00:03:20.349]  Now, mind you, Carn City is right near San Antonio, Texas, which on any given night has about 3,000 homeless people in the city.
[00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:27.793]  So, of course, those homeless people aren't being bused to these detention facilities and given a nice hot meal and flat screen television.
[00:03:28.453 --> 00:03:31.194]  But of course, this is just becoming the new norm.
[00:03:31.214 --> 00:03:46.182]  Now we've reported on so many of these stories of how illegal aliens are basically living the American dream while people like the homeless there in San Antonio and all across the country are basically suffering.
[00:03:46.542 --> 00:04:04.074]  And coming up later in the show, David Knight is going to be speaking with a car salesman who reveals just another one of these ways that illegal aliens are kind of bypassing the law, living the American dream, racking up all kinds of new cars and things like that by using fake social security numbers.
[00:04:05.515 --> 00:04:07.977]  Back to Obama's magic pen.
[00:04:08.358 --> 00:04:16.545]  He signed another executive order today, and this one is going to allow for the detention of Americans with respiratory illnesses.
[00:04:16.925 --> 00:04:25.132]  Now, of course, this is all coming on the wake of that Ebola scare, and this executive order is titled, Revised List of Quarantainable Communicable Diseases.
[00:04:25.573 --> 00:04:30.297]  And it amends an executive order that was already in place, passed by George W. Bush in 2003,
[00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:39.682]  It allows for the apprehension, detention, or conditional release of individuals to prevent, you know, the transmission or spread of communicable diseases.
[00:04:39.982 --> 00:04:46.486]  Well, Obama's amendment will allow for the detention of Americans who just display acute respiratory syndrome.
[00:04:46.506 --> 00:04:52.489]  So with the exception of influenza, anyone can be forcibly detained by medical authorities.
[00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:57.770]  So quarantining of people suspected to have Ebola is obviously a wonderful idea.
[00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:06.133]  Now as we highlighted earlier this week, the Centers for Disease Control already has measures in place for dealing with an outbreak of a communicable disease.
[00:05:06.513 --> 00:05:09.274]  It'll allow for the quarantine of well persons.
[00:05:09.574 --> 00:05:10.034]  We're good to go.
[00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:32.613]  But possibly two U.S.
[00:05:32.673 --> 00:05:38.858]  citizens with Ebola are due to fly from West Africa to Atlanta sometime within the next few days.
[00:05:39.298 --> 00:05:42.281]  Now, this is Dr. Kent Brantley and Nancy Wrightbowl.
[00:05:42.321 --> 00:05:49.407]  They are said to be in grave condition, and they are going to be treated with an experimental drug once they get there.
[00:05:49.887 --> 00:05:53.630]  Obviously, Ebola is a highly contagious communicable disease.
[00:05:54.131 --> 00:05:56.433]  Bringing those people to the United States or the U.K.
[00:05:56.493 --> 00:05:57.554]  or Germany, wherever they're
[00:05:58.374 --> 00:06:04.695]  Bringing them in Europe, it's not going to alter the fact that 90% of people who come in contact with this disease will die.
[00:06:05.055 --> 00:06:11.297]  But what it will do by transporting them elsewhere is increasing the risk of the virus spreading.
[00:06:11.777 --> 00:06:17.718]  Now, these patients have Ebola Zaire, which is a condition where all bodily secretions are infected.
[00:06:18.178 --> 00:06:23.679]  This condition causes diarrhea and vomiting, a high fever that causes the patient to sweat.
[00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:26.500]  And bleeding from every orifice.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:34.822]  Now these symptoms are not going to be conveniently just stopped because the patient is transferred to the United States or Germany or anywhere else.
[00:06:34.882 --> 00:06:42.564]  And of course, it's highly dangerous considering they have to be transported through the airport, on helicopters, planes, on the ambulance.
[00:06:42.584 --> 00:06:46.905]  They're going to have to be taken from the ambulance through the hospital into the isolation unit.
[00:06:47.285 --> 00:07:00.395]  Of course, anyone who is responsible for decontaminating the plane or the ambulance that they were riding in, if they miss one drop of any bodily fluid, they're all going to be at risk of being contaminated with this.
[00:07:01.015 --> 00:07:07.260]  And the virus has been shown to remain active outside of the body in dry or liquid form for three days.
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.602]  So this is just one of those things that
[00:07:10.886 --> 00:07:12.828]  We like to call here madness.
[00:07:13.028 --> 00:07:14.309]  It's totally madness.
[00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:20.653]  Now obviously you want to have sympathy for these patients, but why would you want to risk spreading this disease?
[00:07:20.713 --> 00:07:22.194]  There is no cure.
[00:07:22.214 --> 00:07:29.239]  Now John Rappaport writes that we should be cautious about this Ebola outbreak morphing into hysteria.
[00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:31.280]  Here is one predictable outcome.
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:39.826]  He says that clinics and hospitals frighten people who arrive with what are labeled early signs of Ebola will now be labeled as probable cases.
[00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:42.067]  The symptoms are very flu-like.
[00:07:42.187 --> 00:07:44.488]  Fever, chill, sore throat, cough, headache.
[00:07:44.969 --> 00:07:48.891]  And of course, the news media is going to love this killer germ.
[00:07:49.231 --> 00:07:58.056]  And as I mentioned earlier, Obama has already signed an executive order that will be able to give the authority to detain these probable cases.
[00:07:58.536 --> 00:08:03.018]  Now, the PSYOP warriors, people are going to say global pandemic every 15 seconds.
[00:08:03.098 --> 00:08:05.680]  The news is going to report all of these cases of people
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.621]  You know, with these early signs of Ebola.
[00:08:09.121 --> 00:08:14.543]  And Rappaport writes that this is to exert control over the population and obtain compliance.
[00:08:14.923 --> 00:08:18.884]  Stay indoors, don't travel, avoid contact with people who might be ill.
[00:08:19.484 --> 00:08:21.665]  Every so-called pandemic is a test.
[00:08:22.225 --> 00:08:24.766]  How well will the population follow orders?
[00:08:25.106 --> 00:08:32.268]  And, of course, the World Health Organization will shut down the airports, no planes should take off or land, keep the ships in harbor.
[00:08:32.828 --> 00:08:34.748]  And Rappaport warned about this way back in 1987.
[00:08:35.209 --> 00:08:40.830]  He says medical propaganda ops are, in the long run, the most dangerous.
[00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:46.412]  They appear to be neutral, they have no political banners, and they claim to be science.
[00:08:46.832 --> 00:08:47.832]  And for these reasons,
[00:08:48.212 --> 00:08:53.315]  They can accomplish the goals of overt fascism without arousing suspicion.
[00:08:53.955 --> 00:09:00.739]  And of course today in New York City, they are running the largest ever surprise emergency drill there.
[00:09:00.779 --> 00:09:06.902]  Now we reported last year about them testing to see how fast any airborne diseases would travel through this
[00:09:07.242 --> 00:09:25.226]  The subway system, but now they have a massive emergency preparedness drill that is taking place at 30 facilities across the city and it's testing the delivery of emergency medications in the event of a large-scale public health emergency or a biological attack like anthrax.
[00:09:25.766 --> 00:09:32.630]  Now, it's the largest surprise drill in the city's history, and participants weren't given any notice of this.
[00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:36.612]  They wanted to test the real, actual emergency response.
[00:09:36.992 --> 00:09:38.653]  But never fear, because the U.S.
[00:09:38.693 --> 00:09:41.415]  government is already planning to take care of you.
[00:09:41.455 --> 00:09:44.197]  They've already been prepping for this Ebola outbreak.
[00:09:44.717 --> 00:09:52.301]  They say they're going to begin testing on people an experimental Ebola vaccine as early as September.
[00:09:53.942 --> 00:10:03.625]  The National Institutes of Health's Infectious Disease Unit is working with the FDA to put the vaccine into trial as quickly as possible.
[00:10:04.165 --> 00:10:05.906]  Now, what could possibly go wrong?
[00:10:05.946 --> 00:10:18.510]  We've already heard, you know, the experimental H1N1 was causing a lot of pregnant women to have spontaneous abortions, and that was in the thousands here with H1N1.
[00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:18.790]  We know
[00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:22.851]  The flu vaccines, they cause the flu or flu-like symptoms.
[00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:27.933]  So could this experimental Ebola vaccine cause Ebola-like symptoms?
[00:10:28.233 --> 00:10:38.656]  Or is it basically going to be like the opening scene of The Walking Dead or any other zombie movie you've ever watched ever in the history of zombie movies?
[00:10:39.721 --> 00:10:42.685]  Now coming up, more on the pending police state.
[00:10:43.005 --> 00:10:55.300]  And then we speak exclusively with the whistleblower, who reveals how illegal aliens are duping the system to get free cars, while you and I are busting our butts just so we can keep making payments on our jalopies.
[00:10:57.136 --> 00:11:06.146]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:11:06.226 --> 00:11:14.455]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:11:14.635 --> 00:11:19.300]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:26.203]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:11:26.283 --> 00:11:33.345]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:11:33.465 --> 00:11:40.348]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:11:40.488 --> 00:11:44.830]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:48.171]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:11:48.351 --> 00:11:54.475]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:11:54.635 --> 00:11:56.316]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:12:18.411 --> 00:12:22.934]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[00:12:23.234 --> 00:12:31.599]  The InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[00:12:31.819 --> 00:12:33.780]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.902]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers
[00:12:37.042 --> 00:12:37.402]  We're good to go.
[00:12:58.405 --> 00:13:04.750]  FBI agents and police turned the entire town of Armada, Michigan into a checkpoint last night.
[00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:16.518]  They were interrogating every single driver who tried to enter or leave the town, and they were searching for clues on the murder of April Millsap, who was found in a wooded area last week.
[00:13:16.598 --> 00:13:17.659]  She was murdered there.
[00:13:17.699 --> 00:13:23.043]  Now, after the police were done interrogating every driver, they would mark their hands with an X.
[00:13:23.823 --> 00:13:25.364]  And basically send them on their way.
[00:13:25.424 --> 00:13:27.764]  But this is becoming a new norm.
[00:13:28.164 --> 00:13:33.086]  Mass investigative detention as part of a crime investigation.
[00:13:33.526 --> 00:13:41.489]  Now we had in June 2012 the bank robbery in Aurora, Colorado, where everyone within the vicinity of the bank was handcuffed.
[00:13:41.929 --> 00:13:50.736]  California Highway Patrol officers set up a checkpoint in Sacramento, California after a gang member shot and injured a number of police officers.
[00:13:50.776 --> 00:13:51.757]  Then he went into hiding.
[00:13:52.137 --> 00:14:02.065]  And that's where you will recognize that one infamous photo where the police officer was aiming a gun at an innocent driver's head who just happened to go through the checkpoint.
[00:14:02.606 --> 00:14:06.449]  Now, also during the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing,
[00:14:07.029 --> 00:14:09.330]  The entire town was shut down.
[00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:17.154]  Heavily armed police went door-to-door without search warrants, terrorizing families at gunpoint and ransacking homes.
[00:14:17.614 --> 00:14:26.819]  And then last year in California, during the manhunt for Christopher Dorner, police wildly shot and injured numerous innocent people.
[00:14:27.319 --> 00:14:29.380]  So, this is what is becoming the new norm.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:34.522]  Entire towns full of Americans are being detained to catch one guy.
[00:14:34.922 --> 00:14:44.566]  Meanwhile, the DHS is knowingly releasing 36,000 criminal illegal aliens back onto the streets of America just last year alone.
[00:14:44.626 --> 00:14:47.907]  These are criminals who committed the crimes such as rape,
[00:14:48.747 --> 00:14:49.948]  We're good to go.
[00:15:14.741 --> 00:15:18.063]  From, you know, from all of these dangerous guns and criminals.
[00:15:18.663 --> 00:15:25.087]  Meanwhile, in Massachusetts, they're trying to further toughen their gun laws by passing a new bill today.
[00:15:25.567 --> 00:15:30.990]  This one is going to give police chiefs the authority to decide who can purchase a rifle or shotgun.
[00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:36.753]  Now, House lawmakers overrode objections from gun rights advocates there in the State Senate.
[00:15:37.153 --> 00:15:44.097]  They oppose the measure, worrying that police chiefs could abuse their authority to deny firearms to law-abiding citizens.
[00:15:44.577 --> 00:15:46.878]  Now, the measure broadens the authority of police.
[00:15:46.918 --> 00:15:51.680]  They were already allowed to deny sales of handguns to people who failed background checks.
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:16:01.905]  Well, this new measure gives a police chief 90 days to petition a court to deny a firearms ID card to someone the chief believes to be unfit.
[00:16:02.065 --> 00:16:03.926]  So now the chief gets to decide.
[00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:09.828]  And of course, there's no need to worry about any corrupt police chiefs abusing their power, right?
[00:16:09.868 --> 00:16:14.890]  I mean, they certainly wouldn't do that there in the corrupt Albuquerque Police Department.
[00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:24.193]  Or, of course, we have the six Philadelphia police officers who were charged today with armed robbery, kidnapping, and drug dealing.
[00:16:24.989 --> 00:16:25.869]  Part of a huge ring.
[00:16:26.309 --> 00:16:28.310]  But you know, no corruption there.
[00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:34.711]  The police chief should be given the authority to decide who can go ahead and exercise their Second Amendment right to protect themselves, right?
[00:16:35.191 --> 00:16:38.152]  And old Bloomberg, he just won't give up.
[00:16:38.252 --> 00:16:44.634]  He just wants your guns and he continues to promote it in the most awful way possible.
[00:16:45.154 --> 00:16:49.555]  Here is his latest gun grab ad that completely backfired.
[00:16:50.191 --> 00:16:50.871]  It's my ex.
[00:16:50.891 --> 00:16:51.812]  He's trying to break in.
[00:16:51.952 --> 00:16:53.132]  Do you have a restraining order?
[00:16:53.152 --> 00:16:53.772]  This is my house!
[00:16:53.832 --> 00:16:54.413]  Yes, please!
[00:16:54.473 --> 00:16:55.513]  My son is here!
[00:16:55.633 --> 00:16:56.573]  Open the door!
[00:16:56.593 --> 00:16:58.694]  I need you to stay calm.
[00:16:58.714 --> 00:16:59.454]  He just broke in the door.
[00:16:59.474 --> 00:17:00.235]  You need to come now.
[00:17:00.815 --> 00:17:01.575]  Get away from him!
[00:17:02.676 --> 00:17:03.216]  Hey!
[00:17:04.396 --> 00:17:05.177]  Get away!
[00:17:05.497 --> 00:17:07.517]  Get out of here!
[00:17:08.038 --> 00:17:08.598]  I'm taking him!
[00:17:12.247 --> 00:17:14.647]  So ridiculously out of touch, Bloomberg.
[00:17:14.807 --> 00:17:21.689]  This video basically makes the case for having a gun in the home to protect yourself and your child.
[00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:27.810]  Having a gun in the home would have been the only thing that would have put that woman on level playing field with her estranged husband.
[00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:33.811]  And also, Bloomberg's ad went so far as to show her making a 911 call.
[00:17:34.131 --> 00:17:39.692]  But as we all know, when seconds count, police will take minutes to get there.
[00:17:41.312 --> 00:17:54.485]  You know, here we go, we're just trying to propagate to the American people and convince them that it would have been better if there were just no guns at all, because then this guy, you know, he couldn't have come in and beat her, you know, and slapped her around and then stole the baby, right?
[00:17:54.626 --> 00:17:59.871]  No, it's gonna be the gun that's the only thing that's gonna put that woman on level playing field with the man.
[00:17:59.931 --> 00:18:01.813]  He probably would never have even attempted
[00:18:02.253 --> 00:18:05.675]  So, thank you Bloomberg for making the case to protect our Second Amendment right.
[00:18:05.775 --> 00:18:07.496]  Of course, so ridiculously out of touch.
[00:18:07.516 --> 00:18:08.797]  But, here we go, what is a police state without turning
[00:18:25.507 --> 00:18:28.888]  Everyone here in America into potential criminals.
[00:18:28.988 --> 00:18:31.448]  And of course, that's why they're wanting to track us all.
[00:18:31.929 --> 00:18:38.350]  But New Zealand parents were really surprised to find out that their children were going to be treated like prisoners are in a jail.
[00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:43.511]  They were upset to learn that their children were going to be given chipped bracelets to track their behavior.
[00:18:43.871 --> 00:18:45.292]  They weren't even notified about it.
[00:18:45.332 --> 00:18:48.813]  They just found out about it via the minutes from a PTA meeting.
[00:18:49.213 --> 00:18:54.494]  Now, under this proposal, the devices locked to kids' arms and they would allow teachers to use
[00:18:54.514 --> 00:19:01.917]  These portable scanners in order to add reward points to a student's good behavior and they would of course be stored on a database.
[00:19:02.237 --> 00:19:08.699]  So here they're making these bracelets look really cool and they're giving these kids points for being tracked.
[00:19:09.079 --> 00:19:20.263]  Students are going to be rewarded the points for doing something that the teachers determined to be positive and then incentives would be enhanced with the promise of prizes for reaching a certain amount of points.
[00:19:20.663 --> 00:19:25.048]  Now, the school claims that the devices wouldn't have any GPS trackers.
[00:19:25.529 --> 00:19:38.824]  Obviously, parents were outraged at the scheme, which is otherwise literally employed on prisoners to monitor their whereabouts and, of course, activities of offenders who are on parole.
[00:19:40.146 --> 00:19:43.087]  So, but now they're going to make it cool and clever for the kids.
[00:19:43.147 --> 00:19:48.868]  Maybe they can get some of those tracking bracelets for the people who are entering our country illegally.
[00:19:49.248 --> 00:19:50.588]  But it's not just New Zealand.
[00:19:50.628 --> 00:19:52.949]  Of course, we've reported on schools here in the U.S.
[00:19:53.329 --> 00:20:03.451]  attempting this same type of tracking with the RFID cards, but also trying to use biometric iris scans when kids board the buses here.
[00:20:04.511 --> 00:20:09.813]  It is so ridiculous, they are literally trying to turn us into a permanent slave class.
[00:20:10.133 --> 00:20:16.116]  And of course, one way to do that is to use these tracking devices to attach us to our debt.
[00:20:16.636 --> 00:20:26.780]  Currently, Americans are attached to their debt via their social security number, but people who are in this country illegally are finding ways to skirt this debt slavery.
[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.421]  Coming up, we're going to be speaking with a whistleblower.
[00:20:31.297 --> 00:20:35.100]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.721]  I didn't like, it tastes dirt in it.
[00:20:36.781 --> 00:20:37.882]  God knows what's in this.
[00:20:38.042 --> 00:20:39.023]  This has an aftertaste.
[00:20:39.063 --> 00:20:40.644]  Tastes like Austin water?
[00:20:40.904 --> 00:20:41.765]  Yeah, it does.
[00:20:41.825 --> 00:20:45.988]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[00:20:46.228 --> 00:20:52.353]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered through the ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[00:20:52.493 --> 00:20:53.293]  High quality H2O.
[00:20:53.313 --> 00:20:54.834]  That one is better.
[00:20:54.915 --> 00:20:55.915]  Tastes like nothing.
[00:20:56.075 --> 00:20:57.577]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[00:20:57.637 --> 00:20:58.157]  It's good water.
[00:20:58.257 --> 00:21:06.785]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, Monsanto's deadly pesticide, glyphosate, and many others.
[00:21:07.206 --> 00:21:14.693]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[00:21:14.993 --> 00:21:17.496]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[00:21:18.056 --> 00:21:20.418]  Yeah, it has that processed flavor to it.
[00:21:20.739 --> 00:21:30.307]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances and many more, leaving only fresh tasting, deliciously clean water.
[00:21:30.487 --> 00:21:32.088]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[00:21:32.148 --> 00:21:32.829]  It's good water.
[00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.951]  Refreshing.
[00:21:34.391 --> 00:21:35.252]  It's good.

[00:21:51.055 --> 00:21:51.895]  The facts are in.
[00:21:52.095 --> 00:21:53.215]  The studies are legion.
[00:21:53.495 --> 00:22:00.837]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:22:00.997 --> 00:22:17.020]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.

[00:22:22.051 --> 00:22:31.924]  We were contacted by email with someone who has been working as a car salesman for quite some time, very concerned about the fraud that he sees going on with illegal aliens.
[00:22:32.484 --> 00:22:38.212]  Now, of course, there's a lot of money to be made every time a loan happens, whether it's a home loan or a car loan.
[00:22:38.552 --> 00:22:39.774]  People are making fees.
[00:22:40.134 --> 00:22:41.535]  People are selling cars.
[00:22:41.915 --> 00:22:45.057]  They will go around the laws until they can change the laws.
[00:22:45.097 --> 00:22:51.261]  Now, what he told us, he says, he's been seeing large finance companies giving auto loans to illegals routinely.
[00:22:51.301 --> 00:22:55.084]  I see them try five to ten Social Security numbers until one works.
[00:22:55.604 --> 00:22:57.486]  And it's good enough to buy a car and get funded.
[00:22:57.946 --> 00:23:00.448]  I see this as fraud, period.
[00:23:00.508 --> 00:23:01.548]  Well, so do we.
[00:23:01.588 --> 00:23:06.031]  So we wanted to get his details and let you know what's going on in just this one area.
[00:23:06.352 --> 00:23:06.972]  Now, we vetted him.
[00:23:07.012 --> 00:23:09.874]  We know that he does work in the car industry in Chicago.
[00:23:10.454 --> 00:23:14.756]  He wishes for obvious reasons to remain anonymous and to have his voice disguised.
[00:23:14.796 --> 00:23:15.817]  So we welcome him now.
[00:23:17.138 --> 00:23:22.360]  So could you tell us a little bit about what you've seen, the types of fraud that you've seen working at car dealerships?
[00:23:23.101 --> 00:23:23.461]  Sure.
[00:23:24.041 --> 00:23:34.567]  Things I've seen would be, you know, basically people who are here apparently
[00:23:35.561 --> 00:23:46.063]  I mean, in some illegal fashion, or even possibly semi-illegal fashion, using what we refer to as Mexican driver's licenses, the proper term would be matriculars.
[00:23:46.943 --> 00:24:00.326]  They've got those that they use as their IDs, but then to get a car loan, you know, you've got to have a valid social security number and have some type of credit that's built up to use so that you can secure the loan from the banks.
[00:24:01.013 --> 00:24:07.860]  Now, what I'm seeing is people using multiple social security numbers to attempt to get these loans.
[00:24:08.601 --> 00:24:18.071]  And, you know, I'm predominantly, you know, I'm of European descent, so a lot of the customers that come in will avoid me.
[00:24:19.028 --> 00:24:25.931]  And when they're using these types of ideas, I look for someone who looks for a Hispanic descent to speak with.
[00:24:26.011 --> 00:24:33.295]  And when they do, you know, sometimes I'll be speaking in English, and I've heard plenty of times in the manager's office of people talking about it.
[00:24:33.877 --> 00:24:41.243]  But you know, they'll come back with social security numbers and tell the customer, well, that one says that you're dead, that you're deceased.
[00:24:41.664 --> 00:24:50.311]  Or it will be like, let's say the person on the social security number was born in 1959, but this person's ID says they were born in the 80s.
[00:24:51.372 --> 00:25:00.200]  So they can't use those and say, you know, they'll go through a handful of them until they actually can, you know, come up with one that banks will accept.
[00:25:00.854 --> 00:25:03.235]  So the listeners know what a matricula is.
[00:25:03.315 --> 00:25:11.259]  This is something that's a form of identification offered by the Mexican Embassy to Mexican citizens who are residing in another country.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.000]  They've been doing that for some time.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:23.166]  As a matter of fact, it was about 10 years ago, there was a bill that they tried to get through Congress that was defeated in 2004, I believe, that was going to stop people from using that to open bank accounts.
[00:25:23.186 --> 00:25:25.527]  But of course, the banks want to see this happen.
[00:25:26.047 --> 00:25:31.270]  They're wiring $18 billion a year out of the country, so they wanted this to happen.
[00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:33.512]  They want to see these automobile loans happen.
[00:25:33.532 --> 00:25:39.015]  Now, if somebody's a legal resident, there's a path for them to get an automobile loan, isn't there?
[00:25:39.576 --> 00:25:41.137]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:25:41.157 --> 00:25:47.141]  There is a definite way for them to be able to do that.
[00:25:47.201 --> 00:25:53.705]  I've even had people who are here on visas in a legal fashion from other countries like China or Japan.
[00:25:54.597 --> 00:25:54.697]  And
[00:26:14.615 --> 00:26:15.336]  We're good to go.
[00:26:33.084 --> 00:26:45.471]  And when you see a huge list of different names that pop up on them, it's a very easy way to say, yeah, obviously this one's one that's getting passed around among numerous different people.
[00:26:46.127 --> 00:26:59.054]  It seems to me like if they don't have a social security number, if they're not here on a visa, that the employer is probably not paying the matching social security fees either, which is about half of your social security amount.
[00:26:59.074 --> 00:27:02.556]  If you are an employee, you see social security coming out.
[00:27:02.596 --> 00:27:03.877]  Of course, there's no deduction for that.
[00:27:03.917 --> 00:27:12.182]  That's a direct tax and it hits people at the poorest end of the spectrum because it cuts off after you reach a certain level of income.
[00:27:12.202 --> 00:27:12.902]  But you're paying 7.5% of a tax
[00:27:16.084 --> 00:27:25.249]  And your employer is paying another 7.5%, but the employers who don't have legal employees are seeing that as a financial advantage, wouldn't you say?
[00:27:25.931 --> 00:27:27.871]  Most definitely.
[00:27:27.891 --> 00:27:32.792]  That would be something that's real easy for them to be able to skip by.
[00:27:32.952 --> 00:27:37.853]  There's many different things that I've seen them be able to get away with doing.
[00:27:37.873 --> 00:27:50.456]  A lot of Americans work real hard for their money and pay the taxes and work real hard to maintain their credit so that they can be able to secure these loans.
[00:27:50.576 --> 00:27:51.956]  I've watched this stuff happen.
[00:27:52.543 --> 00:27:56.166]  You know, probably a few times a week, at least, that I've seen.
[00:27:56.186 --> 00:27:59.009]  I've been doing this for well over 10 years now.
[00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:11.341]  And, you know, it's just, you know, at a certain point, I've had enough to the point where I figured I needed to bring this to people's attention, especially in light of things that are going on currently.
[00:28:11.775 --> 00:28:20.423]  I think what we're seeing here are businesses and banks who are essentially violating the law, ignoring the law until they can change the law.
[00:28:21.084 --> 00:28:23.045]  There are some of the organizations like the U.S.
[00:28:23.065 --> 00:28:27.990]  Chamber of Commerce that are pushing the GOP to ram through this amnesty program.
[00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:30.933]  They're going to continue to do this even if they have to commit fraud.
[00:28:31.253 --> 00:28:34.836]  They'd rather not put themselves out there and commit fraud, but certainly that's not going to bar them.
[00:28:34.856 --> 00:28:36.278]  We've seen some of the largest banks
[00:28:36.758 --> 00:28:36.898]  Yes.
[00:28:57.717 --> 00:28:57.797]  Yes.
[00:29:27.517 --> 00:29:31.839]  Yeah, that's amazing.
[00:29:31.939 --> 00:29:36.001]  I've heard a similar story with customers that I've had come in.
[00:29:36.401 --> 00:29:37.561]  Similar types of things.
[00:29:37.741 --> 00:29:40.262]  I've got a sister in a similar type of a situation.
[00:29:40.282 --> 00:29:43.464]  Those are things I've definitely seen.
[00:29:43.524 --> 00:29:46.065]  I'm sure more and more people will hear about these things.
[00:29:46.818 --> 00:29:49.280]  Think about, you know, situations they know of.
[00:29:49.701 --> 00:29:51.663]  You know, it's pretty broad spectrum.
[00:29:51.683 --> 00:29:53.925]  You know, I'm not in the Texas area.
[00:29:53.985 --> 00:29:55.987]  I'm in the suburbs of Chicago.
[00:29:56.507 --> 00:30:03.354]  And, you know, so I'm pretty far away from the border, even though, you know, this is a large Hispanic area.
[00:30:03.654 --> 00:30:09.920]  And, you know, it's very easy for these things to happen up in this area and other areas around the country.
[00:30:10.655 --> 00:30:16.837]  One last question before we let you go, and I wanted to get a feel for the kinds of businesses that are looking the other way.
[00:30:16.857 --> 00:30:20.098]  Of course, it's automobile dealerships, but what about the banks?
[00:30:20.198 --> 00:30:24.239]  Are there large banks that are involved with this, or is this local banks that you see in the area?
[00:30:24.259 --> 00:30:39.883]  No, it's definitely, that's a good question, it's definitely large banks that will get the funding for, you know, it's any of the banks that will accept the matriculars, and the ones that I'm aware of would be Chase,
[00:30:41.898 --> 00:30:48.940]  Um, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and then the manufacturer that I work for, their own bank themselves.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:57.302]  Um, I won't bring that one in particular, but, um, you know, even that one, so the manufacturers know what's going on as well.
[00:30:57.442 --> 00:31:02.943]  You know, they're definitely very open to funding these types of circulations.
[00:31:02.983 --> 00:31:09.965]  You know, they have to definitely have, you know, some type of a social security number that everything pops up pretty legitimate.
[00:31:10.532 --> 00:31:16.717]  But at the same point, it can't be legitimate when the person doesn't have a legitimate ID to go along with it.
[00:31:17.258 --> 00:31:21.381]  So I don't know exactly how they say this is okay to do it.
[00:31:22.102 --> 00:31:32.090]  You know, one thing that happened in 2008 with the tightening of the financial market, you know, as far as lending goes, they used to use something called a TIN number.
[00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:34.032]  I think I-T-I-N number.
[00:31:34.717 --> 00:31:39.160]  Um, and they were allowing them to use those numbers up until that point.
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.202]  And that was like a temporary identification number.
[00:31:42.622 --> 00:31:46.084]  And so ever since that point, they can't use those indexes.
[00:31:46.425 --> 00:31:49.547]  The customer comes in, has that number, it pops up that way.
[00:31:49.947 --> 00:32:00.074]  And so we have to try and find them, you know, get them to come up with one that actually would be a legitimate type of Social Security number.
[00:32:00.534 --> 00:32:02.715]  So the banks have to be aware of what's going on.
[00:32:02.815 --> 00:32:03.656]  There's no other way.
[00:32:04.275 --> 00:32:06.876]  Well, thank you so much for bringing that to our attention.
[00:32:07.096 --> 00:32:17.919]  It's yet another example of what big business is doing and what's driving what seems to be a no-sense, no-win position for the GOP.
[00:32:17.939 --> 00:32:23.741]  Thank you so much for reporting that to us and taking the time to let us know what's going on in your particular business.
[00:32:23.781 --> 00:32:25.521]  Of course, as is happening in many other businesses.
[00:32:25.561 --> 00:32:25.901]  Thank you.
[00:32:26.342 --> 00:32:26.922]  No problem.
[00:32:26.942 --> 00:32:27.482]  Thank you, sir.
[00:32:29.025 --> 00:32:47.862]  So if you're wondering why the GOP this week would fall on the sword apparently, go against the wishes of over 80% of the people and support Obama's amnesty for illegal immigration, just consider the fact that this is being pushed by the largest banks, by the US Chamber of Commerce, that even if
[00:32:48.442 --> 00:32:57.510]  The GOP goes down in defeat, or even if these guys lose their seat in Congress, they're going to be able to go to K Street and become lobbyists.
[00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:04.836]  They're concerned only about themselves, not about the GOP, not about this country, and they really don't care about what's happening to you.
[00:33:04.916 --> 00:33:07.899]  That's why they don't care about what the majority of people want.
[00:33:08.399 --> 00:33:09.720]  Well, that's it for tonight's news.
[00:33:10.161 --> 00:33:14.264]  Please consider becoming a Prison Planet TV subscriber if you're not already a subscriber.

[00:34:47.193 --> 00:34:48.833]  Michelle, take us out tonight with Harvey.
[00:34:49.013 --> 00:34:50.274]  What do you want to say to folks out there?
[00:34:50.294 --> 00:34:52.275]  I just want to say hi everybody!
[00:34:54.209 --> 00:35:00.032]  Alright folks, we're here, chattering the left-right paradigm, and just talking about what really makes the world go around.
[00:35:00.312 --> 00:35:02.373]  Harney, what do you think visiting the Infowars Studios?
[00:35:02.693 --> 00:35:03.793]  It's very nice here.
[00:35:04.513 --> 00:35:07.395]  I'm enjoying myself in Austin, Texas.
[00:35:08.395 --> 00:35:09.956]  Obama phone lady here!
[00:35:10.676 --> 00:35:11.077]  Yes.
[00:35:11.637 --> 00:35:13.839]  Hey, I heard you got a phone that isn't an Obama phone now.
[00:35:13.879 --> 00:35:15.160]  Yeah, I got a phone, man.
[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:15.740]  You wanna see it?
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.962]  Let me see it.
[00:35:18.142 --> 00:35:19.323]  Is it the InfoWars phone?
[00:35:19.404 --> 00:35:22.786]  It's the InfoWars.com phone.
[00:35:23.187 --> 00:35:26.009]  We changed from Obama Phone Lady to the
[00:35:26.533 --> 00:35:28.174]  This is the news.
[00:35:29.195 --> 00:35:32.978]  No more Obama.
[00:35:33.058 --> 00:35:33.679]  Upgrade!
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.561]  And no more John Boehner.
[00:35:35.621 --> 00:35:36.902]  No more John Boehner.
[00:35:36.922 --> 00:35:38.043]  No more Republican rhinos.
[00:35:38.063 --> 00:35:39.564]  No more Republican rhinos.
[00:35:40.044 --> 00:35:41.525]  We're getting rid of all of them.
[00:35:41.586 --> 00:35:42.066]  All of them.
[00:35:42.566 --> 00:35:43.167]  New people.
[00:35:44.431 --> 00:35:46.092]  All right guys, we'll see you next week.
[00:35:46.132 --> 00:35:47.533]  And hey, we're going to go to Barton Springs to go swimming.
[00:35:47.833 --> 00:35:48.634]  All right!
[00:35:48.734 --> 00:35:49.815]  Are you going to jump in, Harvey?
[00:35:49.955 --> 00:35:50.515]  Yeah, I'll swim.
[00:35:50.915 --> 00:35:51.876]  All right?
[00:35:52.216 --> 00:35:53.657]  And the range, shooting range.
[00:35:53.997 --> 00:35:56.179]  And I'll also try to take you guys out to dinner on Monday or something.
[00:35:56.219 --> 00:35:57.059]  Okay, that'll work.
[00:35:58.060 --> 00:35:59.281]  You're cool if my kids go along with us.
[00:35:59.321 --> 00:36:00.622]  Yeah, I told you I want to see you, son.
[00:36:00.682 --> 00:36:02.143]  All right, all right, fantastic.
[00:36:02.183 --> 00:36:03.744]  Maybe we'll go shooting when we have time, too.
[00:36:03.764 --> 00:36:05.725]  All right, folks, that's it for this extended coverage.
[00:36:06.045 --> 00:36:07.286]  InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:36:07.727 --> 00:36:10.749]  Only here do we bring you the one and the only Obama phone lady.
[00:36:10.789 --> 00:36:14.351]  And we end with her famous Obama phone statement.
[00:36:14.891 --> 00:36:16.753]  Obama!
[00:36:16.813 --> 00:36:17.933]  You got Obama phone?
[00:36:17.973 --> 00:36:18.314]  Yes!
[00:36:18.434 --> 00:36:21.636]  Everybody in Cleveland, low minority, got Obama phone!
[00:36:22.056 --> 00:36:24.018]  Keep Obama in president, you know?
[00:36:24.038 --> 00:36:25.519]  He gave us a phone!
[00:36:25.859 --> 00:36:26.479]  He gave you a phone?
[00:36:26.579 --> 00:36:27.360]  He's gonna do more!
[00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:29.101]  How'd he give you a phone?
[00:36:29.121 --> 00:36:34.905]  You're on full stamps, you're on social security, you got low income, you disability!
[00:36:35.025 --> 00:36:37.087]  Okay, what's wrong with Romney again?
[00:36:37.307 --> 00:36:37.747]  Romney?
[00:36:38.027 --> 00:36:38.728]  He sucks!
[00:36:38.808 --> 00:36:39.768]  He has!
[00:36:44.821 --> 00:36:45.002]  Yeah.
[00:36:48.192 --> 00:36:53.495]  One of the ways law enforcement agencies apply for tax dollars is by touting large arrest numbers.
[00:36:54.196 --> 00:37:02.861]  Oftentimes, stings are used but not always in the most ethical ways, such as when a California cop posed as a high school student to get teens to sell him dope.
[00:37:03.101 --> 00:37:11.466]  One of the teens, who was autistic, had no drug issues until he procured some marijuana for the undercover deputy, who he considered to be his only friend.
[00:37:11.566 --> 00:37:16.449]  The deputy's actions led to the arrest of over 20 students, many facing felony charges.
[00:37:16.789 --> 00:37:22.796]  And one thing that they consistently have trouble answering is to be able to properly define entrapment.
[00:37:22.836 --> 00:37:24.799]  That always gives them a lot of trouble.
[00:37:25.549 --> 00:37:28.210]  Yes, what exactly is entrapment?
[00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:38.393]  I'm all about busting dirty cops and agents, but when thousands of dollars are spent fueling a vice-filled investigation that pulls up nothing, policies need to be changed.
[00:37:38.793 --> 00:37:42.854]  Like when a border patrol agent went to Las Vegas to work a security detail.
[00:37:43.074 --> 00:37:47.416]  The security was for an illegal drug deal, but the agent claims he didn't know that.
[00:37:47.676 --> 00:37:55.418]  Whether or not the agent was double dealing, it was an elaborate sting set up by the feds that was dismissed because of questionable practices.
[00:37:56.118 --> 00:37:58.799]  And stories like these are all too common.
[00:37:58.999 --> 00:38:04.201]  People with no criminal intent pressured into committing illegal acts by those who wish to arrest them.
[00:38:04.501 --> 00:38:10.424]  Or in the name of security, feds burn up grant money and ethics in an attempt to catch small fish.
[00:38:11.104 --> 00:38:17.286]  I'll leave you with a few more examples of how some law enforcement agencies create the very criminals they fight.
[00:38:17.486 --> 00:38:21.128]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com
[00:38:21.548 --> 00:38:27.214]  It will tell you that it, the FBI, has foiled about 17 plots to kill Americans during the past 10 years.
[00:38:27.915 --> 00:38:34.522]  What it will not tell you is that there have been 20 foiled plots, and of them, three were interrupted by members of the public.
[00:38:34.983 --> 00:38:39.188]  The 17 that were interrupted by the feds were created by the feds.
[00:38:42.523 --> 00:38:43.364]  The facts are in.
[00:38:43.544 --> 00:38:44.664]  The studies are legion.
[00:38:44.945 --> 00:38:52.310]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:57.833]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
[00:38:57.993 --> 00:39:08.500]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
