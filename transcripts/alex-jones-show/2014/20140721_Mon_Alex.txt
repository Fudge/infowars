[00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.149]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:08.081]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:15.305 --> 00:00:19.469]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:20.950]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.731 --> 00:00:22.632]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.272 --> 00:00:26.896]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.456 --> 00:00:31.520]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:51.337 --> 00:00:54.302]  Here we are, ladies and gentlemen, kicking off another week.
[00:00:54.402 --> 00:00:56.986]  It is the 21st day of July 2014.
[00:00:57.026 --> 00:01:00.811]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:03.696]  We're going to be live here, Lord willing, for the next three hours.
[00:01:04.557 --> 00:01:05.478]  I've been sitting in here...
[00:01:07.145 --> 00:01:23.387]  The last 30 minutes or so, going back over the news that I was researching early this morning and last night, and some of the news that we covered yesterday evening on the Sunday broadcast that was live, 4 to 6 p.m., and I just pinched myself yet again.
[00:01:24.315 --> 00:01:25.716]  That we are in this situation.
[00:01:26.337 --> 00:01:28.119]  That our world has gotten this crazy.
[00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:39.089]  And that there is intensified fighter-bomber attacks by Ukraine into the east area of Crimea.
[00:01:41.131 --> 00:01:45.855]  That the entire western world is promoting basically a new Cold War with Russia.
[00:01:46.963 --> 00:01:54.608]  And saying now that Russia is the enemy all because of this airline being shot down in a war zone and Russia hasn't even taken responsibility for it?
[00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:04.575]  And the public is so dumbed down and the media is so controlled that it's still not an issue other than CBS News and a few other reports I've seen.
[00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:15.063]  What we pointed out day one last week is that that flight was routed through an area where for at least two months
[00:02:16.608 --> 00:02:26.993]  FAA Europe, there's a branch of the FAA over there, but also the EU air traffic control, had banned flights flying over that area, and no flights have been directed over it.
[00:02:28.794 --> 00:02:39.899]  There's another bizarre story up on InfoWars.com by Paul Joseph Watson today, and that deals with
[00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:46.333]  A Malaysia Airlines diverting flights over Syria airspace.
[00:02:48.174 --> 00:02:50.175]  What's going on with Malaysian Airlines?
[00:02:50.775 --> 00:02:52.236]  You've got one of them disappearing.
[00:02:53.417 --> 00:02:58.599]  You've got this other one directed right over the war zone that no one dare fly into.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.902]  And, I mean, they give you a flight plan, folks.
[00:03:04.522 --> 00:03:08.044]  You follow it, or fighter jets come up and make you land.
[00:03:08.084 --> 00:03:10.045]  It's been like that for 60 years all over the world.
[00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:24.738]  And then now we've got another Malaysian airliner flying right over the war zone in Syria where you're not supposed to fly and there's a flying ban.
[00:03:25.318 --> 00:03:26.119]  A no-fly zone.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.681]  I mean, what's going on with Malaysian Airlines?
[00:03:29.701 --> 00:03:32.763]  These are brand new 777 jets.
[00:03:33.323 --> 00:03:34.784]  They've never had issues before.
[00:03:34.864 --> 00:03:35.965]  I looked into it this morning.
[00:03:36.906 --> 00:03:37.966]  Something's going on.
[00:03:38.667 --> 00:03:45.089]  They've got some weird deal with the Malaysian government or something, with some type of weird clandestine hanky-panky.
[00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:52.392]  And when I bring this up, the controlled dinosaur media, state-run media, will say, Alex with more theories.
[00:03:52.912 --> 00:03:53.852]  Hey, these aren't theories.
[00:03:54.272 --> 00:03:59.054]  They diverted that doomed flight that was shot down last week.
[00:04:00.868 --> 00:04:06.650]  Right over a war zone that nobody dare fly over, where missiles are shooting up in the air, and fighter bombers are bombing cities.
[00:04:10.432 --> 00:04:14.134]  The Russian rebels had shot down three aircraft in the week before that.
[00:04:21.697 --> 00:04:28.880]  So, this is the type of garbage we're dealing with, so I intend to open the phones up on this subject and see what you think, especially if you've worked
[00:04:29.713 --> 00:04:34.875]  For the FAA, or if you've worked in military, air traffic control.
[00:04:34.895 --> 00:04:38.317]  I know we have a lot of air traffic controllers, current and retired, listening.
[00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:40.058]  Does any of this make sense to you?
[00:04:40.098 --> 00:04:40.858]  You're the experts.
[00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:49.963]  I'm going to open the phones up specifically for people who are pilots, or who have civilian or military or private.
[00:04:51.823 --> 00:04:53.444]  And I want to open it up to air traffic controllers.
[00:04:53.484 --> 00:04:56.626]  I don't care if you're from Chile or Texas.
[00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:59.802]  Texas is its own country, you know, at least it should be.
[00:05:00.163 --> 00:05:01.405]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:05:01.425 --> 00:05:01.465]  800-259-9231.
[00:05:01.485 --> 00:05:01.745]  Stay with us.
[00:05:09.315 --> 00:05:14.057]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[00:05:14.297 --> 00:05:17.378]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[00:05:17.638 --> 00:05:19.499]  She's just not the woman I married.
[00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:21.679]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:23.360]  Does this seem familiar?
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.601]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[00:05:26.881 --> 00:05:28.202]  If so, consider this.
[00:05:28.462 --> 00:05:37.385]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[00:05:37.745 --> 00:05:43.769]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.
[00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:45.750]  Forget synthetic chemicals.
[00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:53.815]  Super Female Vitality brings forward key herbs specifically chosen for women's biology without the use of phony additives.

[00:06:01.323 --> 00:06:01.964]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:06:01.984 --> 00:06:03.065]  Live Life Healthy!
[00:06:09.511 --> 00:06:12.095]  Alex Jones here for InfoWars.com.
[00:06:12.295 --> 00:06:16.941]  In the month of July, we have got giant specials on everything at Madein1776.com.
[00:06:16.961 --> 00:06:18.984]  The already discounted Made in 1776 t-shirts are only $17.76.
[00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:24.571]  I think?
[00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:51.925]  Five months free right now when you get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv for a limited time, only $39.95 a year.
[00:06:52.225 --> 00:06:55.747]  That's more than five months free off the regular price.
[00:06:56.088 --> 00:07:02.333]  Not just this July 4th weekend, but the entire month of July at MadeIn1776.com.
[00:07:02.713 --> 00:07:07.797]  Molon Labe, you can take my gun from my cold, dead hands.
[00:07:09.418 --> 00:07:13.141]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[00:07:13.241 --> 00:07:14.482]  I didn't, I taste dirt in it.
[00:07:14.502 --> 00:07:15.583]  God knows what's in this.
[00:07:15.823 --> 00:07:19.906]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[00:07:20.066 --> 00:07:25.810]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:26.971]  That one is better.
[00:07:27.031 --> 00:07:27.991]  Tastes like nothing.
[00:07:28.272 --> 00:07:29.673]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[00:07:29.693 --> 00:07:30.253]  It's good water.
[00:07:30.353 --> 00:07:36.097]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[00:07:36.317 --> 00:07:43.382]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[00:07:43.562 --> 00:07:46.024]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[00:07:46.264 --> 00:07:54.169]  The ProPureÂ® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[00:07:54.289 --> 00:07:55.310]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:56.311]  It's good water.
[00:07:56.531 --> 00:07:56.971]  Refreshing?
[00:07:57.132 --> 00:07:57.512]  It's good!
[00:07:57.772 --> 00:08:00.054]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today.

[00:08:23.591 --> 00:08:29.855]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:42.302 --> 00:08:49.806]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this Monday edition as we broadcast worldwide on the 21st day of July.
[00:08:53.635 --> 00:09:15.794]  Coming up, for the first 30 minutes of the next hour, Glenn Spencer of American Border Patrol, one of the most versatile activists in the last 20 years, exposing the plan of the Forge Foundation in Mexico to break up the United States as part of the North American Union, using Mexican nationalism and border crises to bring it in.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:21.433]  He's been predicting this for more than 12 years that I've been interviewing him on air.
[00:09:21.473 --> 00:09:23.880]  He's been an activist since he was a Native American.
[00:09:26.091 --> 00:09:41.701]  organization activists for the tribal lands and then began to research how Mexico was treating the natives down there who are the indigenous peoples and he is one of the most outspoken folks on the border.
[00:09:41.741 --> 00:09:51.768]  He moved from California to Arizona, I don't know, five, six, seven years ago to be right there on the border and to be able to detail what was happening and unfolding
[00:09:53.271 --> 00:09:55.032]  So that's coming up at the start of the next hour.
[00:09:55.112 --> 00:10:06.716]  Then at the bottom of that hour, I was going to air this last Thursday, but the Malaysian airliner shoot down started.
[00:10:07.396 --> 00:10:09.417]  So I decided to wait until this week.
[00:10:10.995 --> 00:10:15.699]  So that it would not be covered up in the rest of the news.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:35.416]  And that is a 15-minute report we put together with some of the highlights of Matt Drudge in 1998 in a 50-minute speech predicting with almost prescient understanding what would happen to the media landscape in the future.
[00:10:35.736 --> 00:10:37.398]  It's easy to make predictions now
[00:10:39.056 --> 00:10:40.297]  Because we're already here.
[00:10:41.837 --> 00:10:48.160]  But if you go back to 1998, it's truly a trailblazing speech.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:54.442]  And we've added some video clips and news articles and documents to it to make it even more powerful.
[00:10:55.383 --> 00:11:04.406]  Because I saw the speech again on the 15th anniversary, and it got picked up by Time Magazine and others pointing out that Drudge was right.
[00:11:05.327 --> 00:11:07.828]  And then I happened to come across the video again a few weeks ago,
[00:11:09.642 --> 00:11:14.784]  And decided that I wanted to again put out a special report on it.
[00:11:15.145 --> 00:11:19.787]  So that's coming up at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:11:20.987 --> 00:11:36.355]  And then we've got Syrian girl joining us again, who since she first started appearing on this show about a year and a half ago has gone public with her full name and the fact she lives in Australia and that she's part of an exiled family that were kicked out by the Assad's father.
[00:11:37.942 --> 00:11:41.926]  And who were part of the ruling government previous to that, so she is a big insider.
[00:11:42.466 --> 00:11:45.709]  And everything she talked about in the last year and a half turned out to be 100% accurate.
[00:11:46.189 --> 00:11:47.691]  I mean, really knows her stuff.
[00:11:48.191 --> 00:11:53.716]  And now she goes on national Australian television and talks about these subjects as well.
[00:11:54.276 --> 00:11:59.581]  So she'll be joining us coming up from Australia.
[00:12:01.431 --> 00:12:11.959]  In the third hour today, and we'll talk about the situation with ISIS, the situation in Ukraine, not just in the Middle East.
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:23.569]  So the truth about ISIS with Syrian girl coming up today for at least part, probably 30-40 minutes of the third hour.
[00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:28.753]  I want to open the phones up after I cover some news here in a moment.
[00:12:30.011 --> 00:12:40.583]  To deal with the shoot down of the Malaysian airliner MH17 last week.
[00:12:43.902 --> 00:12:52.308]  And I want to talk to people that are, again, private pilots, commercial pilots, military pilots, or air traffic controllers.
[00:12:53.148 --> 00:12:55.810]  Because I know a little bit about air traffic control.
[00:12:55.890 --> 00:13:02.815]  My dad's been a pilot since I was a little kid, both on helicopters and, you know, Cessnas, things like that.
[00:13:03.856 --> 00:13:07.918]  So we would fly to see Grandma, you know, on the weekend and land in the cattle pasture.
[00:13:09.299 --> 00:13:13.122]  I just remember being on my dad on those flights and the fact that there'd be a big storm
[00:13:15.015 --> 00:13:19.257]  And he couldn't go around it because there'd be military bases on both sides.
[00:13:19.457 --> 00:13:28.061]  He would find a local airport and we'd land, and then go in and get some chips out of the vending machine and drink some coffee till it blew over.
[00:13:28.802 --> 00:13:35.345]  And if it didn't blow over, he'd get coffee, I'd get, you know, a sun-kissed soft drink or something.
[00:13:35.825 --> 00:13:39.967]  If it didn't blow over, we would go stay at a little hotel, motel, in the town.
[00:13:41.007 --> 00:13:42.048]  And that happened a few times.
[00:13:43.012 --> 00:13:46.354]  Probably flew with my dad 50, 60 times, probably more than that, probably a hundred times.
[00:13:47.175 --> 00:13:54.941]  And a couple times had to land the plane because he couldn't fly around a thunderstorm because there were so many military bases.
[00:13:55.821 --> 00:14:01.786]  The minute you start straying off your flight path, they come on the radio and they say, what are you doing?
[00:14:01.826 --> 00:14:05.789]  They call out your number and if you don't do what they tell you,
[00:14:07.438 --> 00:14:10.340]  F-16s are on your butt in about 10 minutes.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.282]  That's why 9-11 was a fraud.
[00:14:14.443 --> 00:14:20.126]  They said in the news, USA Today, you name it, that no aircrafts had ever been intercepted in U.S.
[00:14:20.346 --> 00:14:20.706]  history.
[00:14:22.808 --> 00:14:25.770]  And it was completely normal that NORAD stood down for 50 plus minutes.
[00:14:29.272 --> 00:14:33.915]  And that they lost the planes, which obviously wasn't true, and air traffic controllers have gone public about that.
[00:14:34.875 --> 00:14:35.616]  That it was all a fraud.
[00:14:36.894 --> 00:14:44.520]  I don't know exactly what happened on 9-11, but I know that the air traffic controllers, when they finally released part of the tapes, were saying, what is this simulation?
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:49.823]  You've taken control and you're putting simulated aircraft over everything we're doing.
[00:14:50.384 --> 00:14:52.986]  See, that's the centralization that NORAD had.
[00:14:53.026 --> 00:14:57.149]  That's why centralization and technocracy is so dangerous.
[00:14:59.076 --> 00:15:05.780]  Is that a very small group, whoever they were, basically turned the computers off and put overlays in there.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:10.783]  And you hear the air traffic controllers and people even at NORAD saying, is this real or simulated?
[00:15:10.843 --> 00:15:13.704]  Why is there a drill going on right now while this is happening?
[00:15:17.066 --> 00:15:26.051]  And they use the drill to basically have the cover of why someone at NORAD was overriding everything.
[00:15:27.793 --> 00:15:31.216]  Then they ordered the F-16s to fly at near stall speed.
[00:15:33.738 --> 00:15:41.344]  And I got this from multiple military sources, one of them a colonel who died after he came on the show.
[00:15:42.105 --> 00:15:50.872]  Colonel Don DeGrand Prix, who was in Black Ops, all over the world as an arms dealer after he was in the military.
[00:15:52.848 --> 00:15:56.571]  And he died of a heart attack right after he came on.
[00:15:56.631 --> 00:16:01.295]  Might have been natural, but it was so dangerous to be covering that at the time.
[00:16:02.116 --> 00:16:11.523]  And he talked about how an air wing out of the Dakotas, and then named them, was in a drill in Virginia.
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:17.703]  And fired two AIM-9s, that's Sidewinders, into Flight 93.
[00:16:18.003 --> 00:16:23.165]  That's what the state police said they saw and heard was a big explosion and the debris was over all those miles.
[00:16:23.465 --> 00:16:25.246]  And the media would just lie about all of it.
[00:16:25.266 --> 00:16:26.807]  And again, that's the issue with 9-11.
[00:16:27.187 --> 00:16:28.168]  You go into it...
[00:16:29.008 --> 00:16:33.051]  And it just never ends how much evidence there is that the official story is a total fraud.
[00:16:33.331 --> 00:16:35.252]  And then we attack the wrong country.
[00:16:35.632 --> 00:16:58.386]  If you believe really 15 hijackers from Saudi Arabia did it, and there was a stand-down ordered at the embassy in Riyadh to order them to be allowed in the U.S., and I interviewed the head of the visa department at the embassy, Springman, who said, no, they were CIA, we were ordered to let them in, and that their terror designation was a cover.
[00:16:59.616 --> 00:17:02.977]  I mean, he was in newspapers at the time in England and Canada.
[00:17:03.477 --> 00:17:05.078]  I called, got him on the show repeatedly.
[00:17:06.718 --> 00:17:08.619]  And I didn't mean to go off into 9-11 today.
[00:17:09.039 --> 00:17:11.940]  It's just that these are the type of false flags that get run.
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:19.002]  We know our own government has staged a bunch of false flags to get us into these wars.
[00:17:20.263 --> 00:17:24.464]  We know Hitler started World War II with a false flag, Operation Himmler at Glywods.
[00:17:25.774 --> 00:17:30.656]  There's a whole string of false flags to blame the Poles for attacking Germany.
[00:17:32.757 --> 00:17:39.700]  So we'd be fools to not understand that clearly this is war propaganda and that they're trying to start a new war.
[00:17:41.321 --> 00:17:43.882]  Cold war, economic war, maybe even physical war.
[00:17:44.262 --> 00:17:46.703]  They're in a proxy war right now that's physical in Ukraine.
[00:17:48.103 --> 00:17:53.626]  That's what Syria and Iraq and all of this is about and the globalists are the bad guys in this.
[00:17:54.861 --> 00:17:58.404]  Running Al-Qaeda, running ISIS, trying to overthrow all these countries.
[00:17:58.444 --> 00:17:59.665]  Let's not forget about all that.
[00:18:01.226 --> 00:18:07.471]  The reason I want to talk to the air traffic people and the pilots, the article's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:18:07.992 --> 00:18:21.443]  Malaysia Airlines diverts flight over Syrian airspace, where ISIS terrorists are armed with Stinger missiles, control 35% of Syrian territory, and there's a no-fly over the area.
[00:18:22.594 --> 00:18:23.855]  Where this aircraft flew.
[00:18:23.895 --> 00:18:26.278]  This is getting weirder and weirder.
[00:18:27.459 --> 00:18:28.380]  Also a big story.
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:34.746]  Photo evidence shows Ukraine regime delivering the BUK missiles to troops.
[00:18:35.767 --> 00:18:39.110]  And this isn't some Russian article claiming this.
[00:18:40.912 --> 00:18:45.016]  Which it's known that the Ukrainians had these from when they were pro-Russia.
[00:18:47.774 --> 00:18:56.559]  It's in Canadian television from an article about Ukrainian forces win ground in Ukraine.
[00:18:58.681 --> 00:18:59.681]  In Eastern Ukraine.
[00:19:00.762 --> 00:19:07.266]  And Ukrainian forces win more ground in Eastern Ukraine.
[00:19:10.672 --> 00:19:12.074]  And it's an AP photo.
[00:19:12.575 --> 00:19:21.086]  Ukrainian government forces maneuver anti-aircraft missile launchers as they are transported northwest on July 4th, 2014.
[00:19:21.587 --> 00:19:27.534]  And it's an Associated Press article and photo.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:33.423]  Picked up by Channel 24, part of CTV, in Canada.
[00:19:33.843 --> 00:19:38.346]  So it's not even an article about, oh look, the Ukrainians had this missile.
[00:19:39.147 --> 00:19:40.507]  It's been known they had the missile.
[00:19:40.988 --> 00:19:46.331]  But now it shows them rolling them into that area, according to the AP, in an article about how valiant and wondrous they are.
[00:19:47.252 --> 00:19:51.955]  So it's establishment news out of the West, not realizing what they're showing.
[00:19:52.952 --> 00:19:53.553]  Pretty big deal.
[00:19:54.153 --> 00:19:55.875]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[00:19:56.355 --> 00:19:58.818]  We'll get into the whole border implosion as well.
[00:19:59.198 --> 00:20:01.801]  Huge NSA news.
[00:20:01.881 --> 00:20:03.202]  And a lot more straight ahead.

[00:20:32.748 --> 00:20:35.910]  You could buy three Survival Seed Vaults for less than one of theirs.

[00:21:23.806 --> 00:21:24.066]  I think?

[00:21:51.395 --> 00:21:54.918]  That's more than five months free off the regular price.
[00:21:55.258 --> 00:22:01.483]  Not just this July 4th weekend, but the entire month of July at MadeIn1776.com.
[00:22:01.863 --> 00:22:06.907]  Molon Labe, you can take my gun from my cold, dead hands.
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.220]  My name's Bruno.
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:10.421]  I'm 52 years old.
[00:22:10.701 --> 00:22:14.162]  I've tried different protein powders over the years and they've all tasted pretty bad.
[00:22:14.662 --> 00:22:16.683]  I tried One World Whey and found it to be delicious.
[00:22:17.023 --> 00:22:22.745]  After 10 weeks on One World Whey, my wife commented, you have more muscles and you're leaner than when you were 20 years old.
[00:22:23.205 --> 00:22:24.805]  My body has changed dramatically.
[00:22:25.205 --> 00:22:25.846]  I'm a cyclist.
[00:22:26.106 --> 00:22:28.607]  Normally I'll ride two days on and take two days off.
[00:22:28.987 --> 00:22:33.468]  After being on One World Whey, I rode 10 days in a row in over 100 degree heat.
[00:22:33.488 --> 00:22:35.969]  And then I take another two servings of One World Whey.
[00:22:36.349 --> 00:22:38.690]  And then work out at the gym for another hour and a half.
[00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:40.691]  I just couldn't believe these results.
[00:22:41.091 --> 00:22:44.613]  My normal muscle tightness and soreness after working out are virtually gone.
[00:22:45.013 --> 00:22:46.154]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:22:46.514 --> 00:22:48.115]  One World Whey comes in single serving.
[00:22:48.395 --> 00:22:49.375]  Just give it a try.
[00:22:49.976 --> 00:22:55.818]  One World Whey is derived from Amish grass-pastured cows and is newly reformulated to be higher in protein.
[00:22:56.119 --> 00:22:56.439]  Call 888-
[00:22:57.159 --> 00:22:57.860]  988-3325.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:02.063]  That's 888-988-3325.
[00:23:02.263 --> 00:23:04.384]  Or visit oneworldway.com.
[00:23:04.424 --> 00:23:07.426]  That's oneworld-w-h-e-y.com.
[00:23:08.367 --> 00:23:11.589]  How can you save a ton of money and prepare for emergencies?
[00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:14.892]  By having your own in-home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.
[00:23:15.212 --> 00:23:18.815]  Now you can cut down on wasted food by freeze drying your leftovers.
[00:23:19.195 --> 00:23:19.756]  That's right!
[00:23:19.916 --> 00:23:28.023]  Create your own long-term food storage by freeze drying your own fruits, meats, vegetables, even complete meals with the Harvest Right in-home freeze dryer.
[00:23:28.364 --> 00:23:30.786]  Imagine the savings and the peace of mind!
[00:23:31.166 --> 00:23:35.710]  See how the amazing Harvest Right freeze dryer works at HarvestRight.com
[00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:46.513]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:23:46.553 --> 00:23:47.293]  This capitalism?
[00:23:47.353 --> 00:23:53.475]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:23:53.515 --> 00:23:57.157]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:23:57.217 --> 00:23:58.137]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:23:58.157 --> 00:23:59.498]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:23:59.538 --> 00:23:59.838]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:59.878 --> 00:24:00.138]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:24:24.967 --> 00:24:28.809]  So, Malaysian Flight 17 shot down last week.
[00:24:29.329 --> 00:24:30.929]  You would think it's the only story in the world.
[00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:36.852]  Has been officially, in scores of newspapers that I've seen, been blamed directly on Vladimir Putin.
[00:24:38.912 --> 00:24:41.493]  Again, that's pure war propaganda, pure demonization.
[00:24:42.054 --> 00:24:45.215]  You have an aircraft that was flown over a war zone that was shot down.
[00:24:46.415 --> 00:24:47.836]  The Russians may well have done it.
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:25:03.569]  Obviously, the pro-Russian rebels in the predominantly Russian ethnic area of Crimea clearly do have these missiles and have been shooting down military aircraft from Ukraine, NATO-backed and have been bombing them.
[00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:12.355]  And so, if you get on an airliner that gets directed over an airspace that's a war zone and you get shot down,
[00:25:13.689 --> 00:25:18.812]  Logic would say the blame would go on whoever directed that aircraft through there.
[00:25:19.472 --> 00:25:24.955]  If the pilot just broke the law or made a mistake and flew over, they should be blamed.
[00:25:26.195 --> 00:25:29.437]  If the airline ordered it, they should be blamed.
[00:25:29.977 --> 00:25:31.678]  But I'll tell you what the airlines do.
[00:25:31.898 --> 00:25:39.102]  They follow, in major air corridors like that over a war zone, let me tell you, they check their charts and their flight plan probably ten times.
[00:25:41.158 --> 00:25:52.370]  This would have come from the EU air traffic control system, the Ukrainian air traffic control system, NATO, FAA, Europe.
[00:25:53.011 --> 00:25:56.695]  The FAA is in Europe and they're on record two months ago saying don't fly through there.
[00:25:57.436 --> 00:25:59.438]  Not a recommendation, not a warning, an order.
[00:26:01.229 --> 00:26:03.171]  I'm no pilot, I'm no air traffic controller.
[00:26:03.611 --> 00:26:10.938]  That's what I know from just researching the news over the years and flying around with my dad and other pilots.
[00:26:11.538 --> 00:26:12.639]  And being on private jets.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.823]  I've had some friends that have large private jets and I've been on them quite a few times.
[00:26:17.484 --> 00:26:20.246]  And I like to fly up front in the crash seat with the pilots.
[00:26:21.187 --> 00:26:23.089]  It's really neat to get to see all the stuff they're up to.
[00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:28.996]  But we're going to actually talk to air traffic controllers now, pilots and others, and find out if I'm wrong about this.
[00:26:29.016 --> 00:26:37.826]  I want to go to Roy in Wyoming who's an air traffic controller, then Grandpa Stan who's a pilot, Danny who's a former military pilot.
[00:26:39.699 --> 00:26:42.900]  Brendan, who's Air Force, and John, who's a private pilot.
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:43.721]  We'll get to all of you.
[00:26:44.021 --> 00:26:45.821]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[00:26:46.182 --> 00:26:48.002]  But let's go to Roy in Wyoming.
[00:26:48.402 --> 00:26:50.943]  Roy, what do you think about this as an air traffic controller?
[00:26:51.444 --> 00:26:53.244]  And did I get it right, or part of it right?
[00:26:53.685 --> 00:26:54.285]  What do you think?
[00:26:54.325 --> 00:27:02.168]  I mean, isn't the story that all the other air traffic wasn't going through this corridor, and that this flight went through a war zone?
[00:27:04.318 --> 00:27:04.718]  Hey, Alex.
[00:27:04.738 --> 00:27:05.879]  Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[00:27:06.199 --> 00:27:07.899]  There's something that's not adding up there.
[00:27:08.039 --> 00:27:19.924]  If, you know, the pilots do check their flight plans ten times over, the FAA said that they prohibit our airlines from flying over these war zones right now, so there's no way that you'd see a carrier flying through there, especially a 777.
[00:27:20.824 --> 00:27:28.127]  I'm not sure overseas how they're working that, but I imagine it'd be similar since all of our rules are roughly the same or getting close to being the same.
[00:27:28.647 --> 00:27:29.347]  So, yeah, you're right.
[00:27:29.387 --> 00:27:31.048]  It's not adding up at all.
[00:27:31.636 --> 00:27:43.559]  Well, I had some family that worked for FAA Europe, and I gave them a call, and they worked there in the 80s in translating, and they said that there's just no way they would direct an airliner over a war zone.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:55.443]  Absolutely not, and it's not uncommon, for example, on Tuesday the 11th of September 2001, where they'll evacuate, they'll tell everybody in the control tower to leave their position.
[00:27:56.249 --> 00:28:01.393]  And send them into the space down below where there is no windows, then they'll staff that control tower with black ops.
[00:28:01.473 --> 00:28:03.374]  It happens all the time in Fallon, Nevada.
[00:28:04.174 --> 00:28:07.076]  The control tower at Area 51, Diego Garcia, this happens.
[00:28:07.376 --> 00:28:08.877]  You know, it's not uncommon to see that happen.
[00:28:08.897 --> 00:28:11.759]  So that the controllers have no idea what's going on.
[00:28:11.839 --> 00:28:15.662]  Again, repeating the compartmentalization of the federal government.
[00:28:16.553 --> 00:28:27.200]  What does your gut as an air traffic controller tell you is going on over here with this Russia situation and this shoot down of this aircraft?
[00:28:29.081 --> 00:28:34.905]  Eleven years as a controller, my gut tells me that obviously there's a cover-up going on.
[00:28:35.245 --> 00:28:43.611]  And again, if you ask controllers in Europe, chances are they were either removed or if they do talk about it, they're going to be disappeared.
[00:28:44.571 --> 00:28:48.133]  Well, there was a Spanish air traffic controller in Kiev.
[00:28:48.594 --> 00:28:53.017]  This came out in the news and was even on Fox Latino, but then got removed.
[00:28:53.097 --> 00:28:57.240]  David Knight covered this last Friday on the Nightly News with Leanne McAdoo.
[00:28:58.781 --> 00:29:12.110]  And not just this air traffic controller, who was senior, but others said that they were basically told to shut up and that it was shot down by Ukraine.
[00:29:13.047 --> 00:29:25.313]  And that the same thing you just said that the day before they brought new controllers in who they'd never seen before who basically kicked them out when this happened.
[00:29:25.894 --> 00:29:31.957]  And it's strange you said that because you just brought up basically what that Spanish air traffic controller said.
[00:29:32.417 --> 00:29:32.997]  Pretty bizarre.
[00:29:33.017 --> 00:29:33.978]  What does that sound like to you?
[00:29:35.058 --> 00:29:35.478]  Exactly.
[00:29:35.518 --> 00:29:36.339]  And that's their MO.
[00:29:36.359 --> 00:29:38.500]  They've been doing it for a long time so it's nothing new.
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:41.461]  So you're absolutely right.
[00:29:41.481 --> 00:29:42.322]  You're dead on with your
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:48.744]  Of course you're bringing it up and that's what my gut tells me too.
[00:29:48.764 --> 00:29:49.004]  Wow.
[00:29:49.205 --> 00:29:51.206]  Well thank you so much for the call, Roy.
[00:29:51.607 --> 00:29:54.829]  We're gonna go to Grandpa Stan, Danny, Brendan, John and others.
[00:29:54.929 --> 00:29:55.630]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:56.330]  Follow us on Twitter.
[00:29:56.691 --> 00:29:57.571]  Real Alex Jones.
[00:29:58.632 --> 00:29:59.533]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.013 --> 00:30:01.635]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.536 --> 00:30:05.218]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.046 --> 00:30:15.994]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:30:16.214 --> 00:30:20.399]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:25.346]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:30:25.746 --> 00:30:28.368]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:30:28.668 --> 00:30:33.850]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:30:34.131 --> 00:30:40.994]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:30:41.495 --> 00:30:45.277]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:30:45.637 --> 00:30:50.419]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:50.759 --> 00:30:51.600]  This is innovating.
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:59.168]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:30:59.369 --> 00:31:03.433]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.401]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:31:11.741 --> 00:31:19.666]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:31:19.786 --> 00:31:26.910]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:31.613]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[00:31:31.913 --> 00:31:42.081]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:31:42.561 --> 00:31:48.745]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:31:49.046 --> 00:31:51.267]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.

[00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:56.992]  It's not just the super male vitality.

[00:32:10.014 --> 00:32:11.775]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grove.
[00:32:12.296 --> 00:32:19.260]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:30.127]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the Earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[00:32:30.548 --> 00:32:39.794]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the Earth.
[00:32:40.514 --> 00:32:43.935]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[00:32:44.575 --> 00:32:47.996]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[00:32:48.336 --> 00:32:49.936]  Experience the new formula.
[00:32:50.396 --> 00:32:52.377]  Experience the ancient purity.
[00:32:52.977 --> 00:32:53.997]  Shield your family.
[00:32:54.297 --> 00:32:55.718]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:32:56.118 --> 00:32:58.718]  Available now at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:59.278 --> 00:33:03.239]  X2 from Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:33:09.461 --> 00:33:22.214]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:38.371]  We're here six days a week, Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:33:38.391 --> 00:33:38.751]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:38.791 --> 00:33:39.151]  Central.
[00:33:40.031 --> 00:33:42.052]  Then we come back Sundays live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:33:44.232 --> 00:33:55.815]  We have weekday InfoWars Nightly News, 7 o'clock Central, every single night of the weekdays, Monday through Friday, because there's that much important news.
[00:33:57.603 --> 00:34:06.228]  Again, I'm just a logical person, but the public is ignorant about aircraft and just completely ignorant about airspace.
[00:34:07.809 --> 00:34:19.756]  And so they really are being convinced in the polls that Vladimir Putin himself ordered a Malaysian airliner shot down because he wanted to kill 303 completely innocent people.
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:28.921]  And so let's have a big cold war now and spend trillions of dollars and try to wreck Russia, which will just wreck us as well.
[00:34:29.281 --> 00:34:33.742]  And the globalists will go all the way to the bank whistling their way happily.
[00:34:35.843 --> 00:34:38.843]  They don't want Russia setting up an alternative to the dollar.
[00:34:39.804 --> 00:34:46.865]  And Russia and China have been begging for years for the globalists that run the US and Europe to stop devaluing the dollar.
[00:34:48.117 --> 00:34:49.157]  They're all invested in it.
[00:34:50.038 --> 00:34:51.418]  They're all part of the system.
[00:34:52.018 --> 00:34:54.719]  The Communist Chinese, almost every one of their generals is a billionaire.
[00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:55.959]  They're top generals.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:05.202]  And they're now calling it his Lockerbie moment, like he's Gaddafi and ordered a plane shot down.
[00:35:05.842 --> 00:35:06.842]  Turned out that was made up.
[00:35:09.402 --> 00:35:15.088]  And Dianne Feinstein is saying, you know, this is a new Cold War.
[00:35:15.368 --> 00:35:18.171]  And McCain is saying there'll be hell to pay.
[00:35:19.152 --> 00:35:22.035]  And Putin is saying we still haven't ascertained who did this.
[00:35:23.796 --> 00:35:25.798]  The rebels on our side are saying they didn't.
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:30.203]  But we are very sad for the plane being shot down.
[00:35:33.909 --> 00:35:39.313]  And now you think the only people in the world are these 303 dead people from Malaysia.
[00:35:40.474 --> 00:35:50.361]  And that the whole world history should change now, just like a thousand plus died in Lusitania to start World War I with the US and Germany to get the US into the war.
[00:35:54.183 --> 00:35:56.105]  And then that killed millions of people.
[00:35:57.806 --> 00:36:00.428]  And then there was the false flag of the Ford Foundation
[00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:13.796]  And British intelligence and the West openly with the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:36:14.157 --> 00:36:17.239]  This is all mainline Pulitzer Prize winning books on this.
[00:36:17.959 --> 00:36:18.700]  This is a fact.
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.160]  Created Hitler.
[00:36:21.641 --> 00:36:23.483]  Just like they've created Al-Qaeda.
[00:36:24.643 --> 00:36:25.964]  Doesn't mean they run Al-Qaeda.
[00:36:26.044 --> 00:36:30.027]  They create it, give it all the weapons, and then turn Frankenstein loose.
[00:36:33.663 --> 00:36:34.784]  I'm going to go back to your phone calls.
[00:36:34.864 --> 00:36:51.651]  It's just I'm really upset by this because the issue here is the globalists want to kill the dollar but they want then the world to adopt their SDR global carbon tax slash Tobin tax.
[00:36:53.292 --> 00:36:59.895]  They're going to have a tax on oil at the wellhead and all petrochemicals and its derivatives.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.461]  All the derivatives of oil.
[00:37:02.661 --> 00:37:03.462]  Distillates, I guess.
[00:37:05.343 --> 00:37:07.484]  This has all been announced decades ago and they're following the plan.
[00:37:07.885 --> 00:37:28.639]  A global tax on all human activity, the carbon tax, and a money usage tax, a global money VAT on all digital uses of money that tracks everything in real time, but more importantly, controls it and taxes it and can turn off your card or your biometric ID to where you literally
[00:37:29.824 --> 00:37:32.965]  Can buy nor sell if the globalists don't want you to operate.
[00:37:32.985 --> 00:37:39.006]  That's why they're shutting down the lemonade stands and the farmers markets and SWAT teaming Amish that sell cheese to their neighbor.
[00:37:39.906 --> 00:37:46.527]  Because the great sin is not going into a big corporate box store or eating at a corporate chain.
[00:37:47.787 --> 00:37:50.468]  It's now out in the news today what's well known.
[00:37:51.248 --> 00:37:58.449]  McDonald's, Pizza Hut, and KFC get most of their chicken from China.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:12.043]  And if you think the chicken from the United States is bad, or the drugs produced here are bad, 90 plus percent of drugs that are consumed in the U.S., prescription drugs, are made in China.
[00:38:13.523 --> 00:38:19.044]  Close to a third of the chicken now being shipped in and used here in the U.S.
[00:38:19.164 --> 00:38:19.764]  is from China.
[00:38:22.105 --> 00:38:27.886]  And ladies and gentlemen, they were taking, according to this report, at the factories where they buy their chicken from,
[00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:40.376]  13 day old expired, 13 days expired rotten chicken and grinding it up and adding all the different chemicals so you won't get food poisoning.
[00:38:40.777 --> 00:38:49.403]  That's why they radiate the chicken because it's got feces all over it, mites all over it, you name it.
[00:38:49.443 --> 00:38:58.389]  That's why they passed laws here to radiate the beef, the poultry, you name it, and then not even label the fact that it's been irradiated.
[00:39:00.199 --> 00:39:02.980]  Because then they can feed you rotten slop.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.180]  But let me go further.
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:07.721]  They spray on most meat in the U.S.
[00:39:07.761 --> 00:39:18.323]  now, unless it's choice cuts, any processed meat, unless it's from an organic facility, certified, is sprayed with live virus.
[00:39:18.343 --> 00:39:19.583]  Okay, I said I'm going to your calls.
[00:39:20.603 --> 00:39:22.804]  Is sprayed with live virus.
[00:39:24.324 --> 00:39:29.805]  That in Latin, translates into English, bacteria-eating virus.
[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:41.088]  And it is a vaccine, live vaccine, grown in giant tanks that is then sprayed on the meat and then the viruses eat the bacteria.
[00:39:41.749 --> 00:39:43.570]  This is what you're eating.
[00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:48.394]  Now there's the headline, FDA approved spray on virus to keep processed meats safe.
[00:39:49.395 --> 00:39:55.541]  See, it's not just that, quote, McDonald's is fattening or bad for you, ladies and gentlemen, it's that
[00:39:56.812 --> 00:40:02.593]  China is a collapsing hellhole, and that's where, I mean, you do not want to eat food out of China.
[00:40:03.554 --> 00:40:06.214]  Remember the headline in the London Guardian, and I'm going to your calls.
[00:40:07.715 --> 00:40:12.956]  Grandpa, Liberty Pilot, Brendan, John, I'm going right to you.
[00:40:13.016 --> 00:40:14.636]  I just have gone off on a jag here.
[00:40:14.656 --> 00:40:21.318]  It turns out the British, the European, the Chinese, the U.S.,
[00:40:22.608 --> 00:40:26.090]  The Monsanto facilities, none of them eat any of the food.
[00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:36.377]  They all have secret organic farms with tents to even keep the chemicals in the air off the food, and that's what they eat.
[00:40:37.577 --> 00:40:38.538]  That's what the elite eats.
[00:40:39.138 --> 00:40:40.019]  And you can look that up.
[00:40:40.039 --> 00:40:43.001]  The communist Chinese elite have secret organic farms.
[00:40:44.141 --> 00:40:45.042]  It's the same thing here.
[00:40:47.668 --> 00:40:49.109]  Okay, that's how this works.
[00:40:49.129 --> 00:40:52.811]  Remember the headline, German elite get clean vaccine?
[00:40:52.831 --> 00:40:54.392]  Remember that story five years ago?
[00:40:55.733 --> 00:40:57.094]  This is all done on purpose.
[00:40:57.174 --> 00:40:58.155]  Okay, just understand that.
[00:40:58.455 --> 00:40:59.996]  Now, let's go back to the pilots and folks.
[00:41:00.036 --> 00:41:04.579]  Grandpa Stan, Liberty pilot, Brendan, John, and others.
[00:41:04.959 --> 00:41:10.102]  As soon as you hear one of these fellows hang up, that's your chance to call in if you're an air traffic controller or a pilot.
[00:41:11.583 --> 00:41:13.504]  They had said for two months, don't fly over the zone.
[00:41:13.524 --> 00:41:14.065]  That's an order.
[00:41:15.046 --> 00:41:16.487]  They reissued the alert last Friday.
[00:41:17.007 --> 00:41:24.612]  Why was it and not other flights diverted through an airspace with fighter bombers and bombers bombing Russian rebel targets?
[00:41:24.972 --> 00:41:26.193]  What do you expect to happen?
[00:41:27.453 --> 00:41:28.794]  And we don't even know the Russians did it.
[00:41:29.074 --> 00:41:29.735]  Probably did.
[00:41:31.136 --> 00:41:35.658]  But the media is lying and saying they don't have these missiles in Ukraine and the West.
[00:41:35.858 --> 00:41:36.659]  It turns out they do.
[00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:40.121]  Even AP's had to admit that.
[00:41:41.445 --> 00:41:43.406]  The point is you're being lied to, I'm being lied to.
[00:41:43.866 --> 00:41:46.386]  Grandpa Stu, who is a pilot, give us your take on this.
[00:41:48.327 --> 00:41:53.589]  Well, my take is, I'm just reading it off the website here, it says, Kiev-based Hunter shot down the plane.
[00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:59.430]  I'm so glad I have an opportunity to share with humanity the answers to these aviation questions.
[00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:02.171]  There's a website out there called ABLE Danger.
[00:42:02.711 --> 00:42:05.272]  A-B-E-L Danger dot net.
[00:42:05.979 --> 00:42:08.501]  This guy's a former US Marine fighter pilot.
[00:42:08.621 --> 00:42:12.244]  I think he's got 10 or 20,000 hours flying for Delta or something.
[00:42:12.284 --> 00:42:20.791]  He's dedicated his life to uncover and explain to the world what these aviation questions are all about.
[00:42:20.831 --> 00:42:25.335]  I've had that individual on and he has a partner too as a pilot as well.
[00:42:27.036 --> 00:42:29.538]  I believe those are whistleblowers or people exposing 9-11, right?
[00:42:31.482 --> 00:42:40.751]  Well, they're exposing everything in aviation, and for him to be able to explain how Boeing has installed these remote control devices in the last, I don't know, 12 years or so.
[00:42:40.771 --> 00:42:46.616]  Well, they actually already had them on a lot of aircraft before that, but yeah, they're ubiquitous now on all the new aircraft.
[00:42:47.897 --> 00:42:53.202]  But they moved the waypoints electronically, so the poor pilot flying these planes doesn't know they're 300 miles off course.
[00:42:53.683 --> 00:42:54.584]  He thinks he's on course.
[00:42:56.104 --> 00:43:00.186]  And when you start thinking about it, it explains an awful lot of airplanes being downed.
[00:43:00.606 --> 00:43:06.469]  Wondering why they did this or did that is because they didn't know any better because electronically their devices were tricking them.
[00:43:06.509 --> 00:43:06.989]  Well, that's right.
[00:43:07.049 --> 00:43:08.570]  Bush, it was even on PBS.
[00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:09.990]  We found the clip a few months ago.
[00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:10.691]  I remember seeing it.
[00:43:11.251 --> 00:43:16.213]  He went on at a press conference and said, don't worry, we have remote controls on all the new planes.
[00:43:16.914 --> 00:43:21.236]  And then a guy literally grabbed his arm behind him and jerked on the president's arm.
[00:43:21.736 --> 00:43:22.476]  Don't say that!
[00:43:23.497 --> 00:43:24.157]  It's unbelievable.
[00:43:25.114 --> 00:43:35.416]  Well, that's why there's lawsuits now against the Pilots Association because they know that the planes are rigged and the pilots don't want to fly these planes that they can lose control over.
[00:43:35.436 --> 00:43:51.839]  Well, yeah, whenever they had that plane crash, what was it, in San Francisco a few months ago, it came out that pilots are crashing because the computers, they're made to go on autopilot, basically, and then the autopilot's screwing up, and then they're blaming the pilots.
[00:43:55.495 --> 00:44:05.317]  But this Captain Field McConnell, he deserves some kind of an award, because once you start reading his information, oh my goodness, it just explains so much on this aviation stuff.
[00:44:05.457 --> 00:44:06.977]  So buckle your seatbelts, folks.
[00:44:07.617 --> 00:44:08.837]  Abledanger.net.
[00:44:09.037 --> 00:44:13.138]  The poor guy lives in Wisconsin, Plum City, not too far from Minneapolis, St.
[00:44:13.158 --> 00:44:13.918]  Paul, where I'm from.
[00:44:14.718 --> 00:44:15.499]  And it's all there.
[00:44:15.859 --> 00:44:16.939]  All you do is go look it up.
[00:44:17.119 --> 00:44:18.159]  Abledanger.net.
[00:44:18.419 --> 00:44:22.760]  And that's my contribution to humanity, and I'm so happy that I had an opportunity to do this.
[00:44:23.712 --> 00:44:25.053]  Well, thanks for coming on the broadcast.
[00:44:25.073 --> 00:44:27.174]  We should probably get that pilot back on the show.
[00:44:27.194 --> 00:44:28.915]  I believe I had him on like five years ago.
[00:44:28.975 --> 00:44:30.997]  Thank you so much.
[00:44:31.077 --> 00:44:46.427]  When you look at all this, it's just, this is the issue with driverless cars, and driverless planes, and smart houses, and everything being automated, is the technocracy is run by the most anti-human, wicked, vicious people you can imagine.
[00:44:48.737 --> 00:44:56.143]  That's why I'm against, you know, giving my daughters an iPhone with a fingerprint access to it that they're going to make mandatory.
[00:44:56.463 --> 00:44:58.985]  Because then they're going to be used to that to buy and sell.
[00:44:59.465 --> 00:45:00.786]  People say, but it's so convenient.
[00:45:01.447 --> 00:45:04.189]  Except it gives the system total control.
[00:45:04.589 --> 00:45:05.870]  And then you say, well, I don't care.
[00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:07.891]  I have nothing to hide.
[00:45:10.153 --> 00:45:16.218]  There are people killed every minute who are nice walking down the street and get mugged or killed or raped who didn't do anything wrong.
[00:45:17.355 --> 00:45:24.320]  And that's why nice people, chumps, are always victims of crime because they can't imagine it could happen to them.
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.942]  I have friends that I had lost relationships over.
[00:45:30.504 --> 00:45:35.628]  This is about 10 years ago, a friend, where it was the Nigerian email scam.
[00:45:38.939 --> 00:45:40.440]  And he said, man, my ship's come in.
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:42.861]  I'm going to give $5,000 to this prince.
[00:45:42.901 --> 00:45:44.501]  That's where everybody knew it was a total fraud.
[00:45:44.521 --> 00:45:47.763]  People knew for years, but it wasn't like widespread known that was a fraud.
[00:45:49.243 --> 00:45:51.424]  And I just got to send him $5,000 and I get a million.
[00:45:54.125 --> 00:45:55.806]  And they believe their ship had come in.
[00:45:55.866 --> 00:46:03.069]  Even smart people have this gambler gene, I guess, in their brain where they just imagine and you say, no, no, that's a con.
[00:46:03.089 --> 00:46:06.310]  But I've been around for about five years at the time, about 15 years now.
[00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:08.451]  And I said, if you give them that money next,
[00:46:09.872 --> 00:46:24.079]  They're going to send me $10,000 because Prince Abubi got blocked by the other Crown Prince, but he'll be indebted with you and meet you at the Ritz-Carlton in one month with the $5 million now, if you give him $10,000.
[00:46:24.519 --> 00:46:27.741]  And my friend was like, well, I've already given him $5,000.
[00:46:28.441 --> 00:46:28.781]  Shut up!
[00:46:29.061 --> 00:46:31.963]  You're just jealous that I've had this opportunity.
[00:46:32.783 --> 00:46:35.464]  And they got taken for about $15,000.
[00:46:38.391 --> 00:46:48.077]  And would never talk to me again and hated me because I told him it was a scam and they didn't want to ever admit it was a scam and they believed the bull just quit sending money to Nigeria.
[00:46:50.198 --> 00:46:57.282]  Woman gives Nigerian scammer $50,000, $500,000 after meeting him on christianmingle.com.
[00:46:57.942 --> 00:46:58.703]  That's from TechNerd.
[00:46:58.723 --> 00:47:06.327]  See, and I went out to hear some great rockabilly music a few months ago with Mike Judge, the movie producer.
[00:47:09.104 --> 00:47:11.185]  I don't know why I'm named Robin, that's where I went with him there.
[00:47:11.685 --> 00:47:16.948]  And it was at a place in East Austin, and there were guys in there in African rubs, everyone bowing down to them.
[00:47:18.089 --> 00:47:20.150]  That's where Mike got there, I was there before he got there.
[00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:24.593]  And like, oh, it's the ambassador from Nigeria.
[00:47:25.693 --> 00:47:33.057]  And I had my smartphone, I walked over and I went, so you're the ambassador from Nigeria, a very important person?
[00:47:33.858 --> 00:47:34.798]  I said, really, what's your name?
[00:47:34.838 --> 00:47:36.339]  And I started Googling it right there.
[00:47:36.359 --> 00:47:37.660]  I just laughed at the guy.
[00:47:38.345 --> 00:47:43.692]  And they got up and went out and had the guy open the door to their car, and because I could see him out the window and he drove off.
[00:47:44.052 --> 00:47:50.400]  And just everyone, the white yuppies, black people, it was a black slash white bar, were just all bowing down.
[00:47:51.041 --> 00:47:52.803]  Just, oh, the Prince of Boopie!
[00:47:53.383 --> 00:47:54.305]  Oh, Boopie!
[00:47:54.465 --> 00:47:54.825]  Boopie!
[00:47:55.906 --> 00:48:00.348]  And that's what all this is with Obama and the New World Order and the open borders.
[00:48:00.628 --> 00:48:02.289]  It's everybody believing their ships come in.
[00:48:02.809 --> 00:48:04.550]  Oh, Obama's going to give me free health care.
[00:48:04.770 --> 00:48:05.731]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[00:48:05.751 --> 00:48:08.532]  I don't have to worry about my mortgage or my car payment or my gas bill.
[00:48:10.073 --> 00:48:12.414]  Brendan, then John, and then Liberty Pilot.
[00:48:12.814 --> 00:48:13.974]  Brendan, thanks for calling in.
[00:48:13.994 --> 00:48:14.655]  Thanks for holding.
[00:48:15.275 --> 00:48:15.995]  You're on the air.
[00:48:16.015 --> 00:48:16.996]  You say you're in the Air Force.
[00:48:17.036 --> 00:48:18.056]  What's your take on all this?
[00:48:19.657 --> 00:48:20.517]  Yes, thank you, Alex.
[00:48:20.858 --> 00:48:22.959]  Yes, I was in the Air Force in the early 90s.
[00:48:26.051 --> 00:48:51.742]  It's very possible that, well, first of all, when you have an aircraft that's on a projected flight path, it's pretty much going to stay on that path unless there's some extraneous circumstances that are going to force it to have to fly around something, like in the case of a 747 that has to fly around a volcano that has erupted.
[00:48:51.782 --> 00:48:52.883]  I remember there was a story
[00:48:53.737 --> 00:49:02.302]  from the 80s where a 747 flew through an ash cloud at night time from a volcano and shut the engines down.
[00:49:03.623 --> 00:49:12.749]  You know, nowadays we have real-time information to let those pilots and crew plan for any anything in the way of the flight.
[00:49:12.769 --> 00:49:15.190]  It's all plotted out for months.
[00:49:15.291 --> 00:49:17.292]  Don't fly over this area, correct?
[00:49:17.332 --> 00:49:22.095]  So the big question should be who directed the flight over it, correct?
[00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:45.079]  Correct, and there's reports that there were Ukrainian fighters that actually went up to altitude and possibly have nudged that Malaysian airliner, you know, so many miles each way, above or below, or within, I should say, the Lugansk, Donetsk region of Ukraine.
[00:49:45.139 --> 00:49:50.361]  And then that way, that way, I've seen those reports, that way there wouldn't be a record of the flight plan being changed.
[00:49:50.601 --> 00:49:52.182]  They would just order them radio to radio.
[00:49:53.241 --> 00:49:54.302]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:49:54.362 --> 00:49:58.543]  So if their projected flight path was, okay, well, we know that's a war zone.
[00:49:58.583 --> 00:50:02.445]  So let's fly above that war region or below the region.
[00:50:03.385 --> 00:50:05.666]  And that will be our projected flight path.
[00:50:05.726 --> 00:50:15.630]  And then when you're in that area, those fighters come in and force you back into that war over that war zone, and then break off.
[00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:19.652]  And then, you know, it's it's shot down by a missile or
[00:50:20.831 --> 00:50:22.132]  Or what have you.
[00:50:22.472 --> 00:50:40.282]  But what I'd like to call attention to is a short video that showed a, it was either a pro-Russian rebel or Ukrainian forces, some guy that was off of the back of a truck with an armful of fresh passports.
[00:50:41.583 --> 00:50:42.663]  Crisp passports.
[00:50:42.683 --> 00:50:44.084]  No, I saw that, I saw that, I know.
[00:50:44.484 --> 00:50:45.425]  None of this adds up.
[00:50:46.866 --> 00:50:50.547]  I quite frankly, again, don't know what happened, but I know it's war propaganda.
[00:50:50.787 --> 00:50:52.407]  I know we don't need a new Cold War over this.
[00:50:52.687 --> 00:51:05.530]  I know it's a war zone, and I know that if it turns out to be the Russians, I believe, according to studying international law and seeing other shoot-downs, that the blame goes on whoever directed that flight over a war zone.
[00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:11.671]  I mean, you're in the Air Force, and you seem to know a lot about this, but is that correct, what I just said?
[00:51:11.691 --> 00:51:13.551]  Absolutely.
[00:51:13.571 --> 00:51:15.912]  I just believe that, and I'm not
[00:51:16.604 --> 00:51:23.110]  Pro-Russia either, but I just believe that why would they spend the time and the resources to prove that they didn't have anything to do with it?
[00:51:24.351 --> 00:51:37.262]  Uh, you know, and to prove to the rest of the world, hey, you know, we, we, what, what reason will we have to bring this airliner down so we could draw the attention of the West and the rest of the world on us?
[00:51:38.593 --> 00:51:47.382]  Uh, you know, Russia has a lot to lose if a major war started, you know, that huge, you know, gas and oil deal or whatever they're with China.
[00:51:48.363 --> 00:51:58.833]  They stand a lot to lose by doing something stupid like that and inciting, uh, you know, a conflict.
[00:52:00.209 --> 00:52:01.410]  It just doesn't make any sense.
[00:52:01.671 --> 00:52:03.292]  I agree.
[00:52:03.532 --> 00:52:05.474]  This is Lusitania 2.0.
[00:52:05.534 --> 00:52:06.095]  Great points.
[00:52:06.395 --> 00:52:07.436]  Thank you for calling in, Brendan.
[00:52:08.116 --> 00:52:11.680]  Let's go ahead now and talk to John in North Carolina, who's a private pilot.
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:14.542]  Then we'll talk to Liberty Powell, who's a commercial pilot.
[00:52:14.582 --> 00:52:14.943]  Go ahead.
[00:52:18.206 --> 00:52:18.646]  Go ahead, John.
[00:52:22.028 --> 00:52:23.989]  Alright, I'm going to go back to John in a minute.
[00:52:24.009 --> 00:52:25.369]  He's just got his radio on listening.
[00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:30.111]  There's an internet delay, plus we delay the show 10 seconds per FCC.
[00:52:31.712 --> 00:52:35.294]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's why you hear a delay when you're on the phone versus listening on the radio.
[00:52:36.094 --> 00:52:38.235]  Liberty Pilot, you are on the air.
[00:52:38.275 --> 00:52:38.675]  Go ahead.
[00:52:40.416 --> 00:52:40.856]  Yes, sir.
[00:52:40.876 --> 00:52:42.717]  You guys are hitting it pretty much on the head.
[00:52:43.977 --> 00:52:49.219]  Somewhere in there, they've, I guess, got some compartmentalization going on.
[00:52:51.557 --> 00:52:54.058]  And somehow this happened.
[00:52:54.338 --> 00:53:01.079]  But from the air defense point of view, I used to work on the air defense system back in the 90s.
[00:53:01.459 --> 00:53:10.621]  And that system, or tactical systems there, you know, they can't distinguish whether that's an airliner or a military aircraft.
[00:53:11.661 --> 00:53:18.282]  And someone gives them the wrong information or anything, or if like those aircraft you say were
[00:53:19.402 --> 00:53:40.850]  Above or below that airspace where that airplane was flying, radar could, you know, if the aircraft that's flying and the military aircraft that was on nearly the same heading, you know, one could mistake one for the other and the system hit the wrong aircraft.
[00:53:43.869 --> 00:53:54.790]  I just know that, and we've had air traffic controllers call in, air force pilots, you name it, and of course you've been a commercial pilot and former air defense, and it's just you do not fly over a war zone.
[00:53:56.096 --> 00:54:00.279]  And then you gotta ask, why on earth was that Malaysian aircraft over that?
[00:54:00.979 --> 00:54:06.563]  And there are reports coming out from credible sources of the Ukrainian fighter jets in and around it.
[00:54:06.963 --> 00:54:12.306]  They could have forced it in there, they could have been around it to confuse it, or they might have been going up to see what it was.
[00:54:12.987 --> 00:54:22.733]  It could be the pilot made a mistake, but I mean, when you're flying around war zones, I mean, a regular pilot getting an assessment checks their flight plan five or six times, commercial pilots
[00:54:24.534 --> 00:54:31.896]  I mean, I've been on private jets, and you name it, known pilots of large passenger liners, and they check their flight plan like ten times, neurotically.
[00:54:32.397 --> 00:54:38.819]  Because that's how you don't make mistakes, is over and over again, you know, walk through things, and I just do not buy it.
[00:54:39.539 --> 00:54:50.523]  And it's really weird now that you have the disappearing Malaysian aircraft, and this one, and another one that just flew over Syrian area where there's a no-fly zone, right in the rebel-held area.
[00:54:51.403 --> 00:54:54.684]  So, something is going on, and it might be at Malaysian Airlines.
[00:54:55.785 --> 00:54:59.106]  I mean, I don't know, maybe they're a bunch of morons, but I don't think that's the case.
[00:55:00.226 --> 00:55:01.747]  I don't know enough about Malaysian Airlines.
[00:55:02.167 --> 00:55:05.748]  I know they fly all over the world and didn't have a bad history before I looked it up.
[00:55:05.848 --> 00:55:08.769]  So, what does that sound like to you as a commercial pilot that's going on?
[00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:12.470]  I don't know, Alex.
[00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:19.893]  Just something's going on there, and I was wondering the same thing about that Malaysian Airlines.
[00:55:21.215 --> 00:55:24.758]  It seems like they're the target airline for incidents, all of a sudden.
[00:55:25.058 --> 00:55:25.278]  Yeah.
[00:55:25.518 --> 00:55:27.339]  Alright, well thank you so much for the call, sir.
[00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:39.308]  By the way, they just found a CBS news piece that I'll watch during the next break and find out what they're saying, where the Malaysian Airlines defends their war zone flight path.
[00:55:39.368 --> 00:55:44.331]  So, maybe that's why they're the target airline, because they'll play along with it.
[00:55:44.392 --> 00:55:46.233]  Because you're not supposed to fly through there.
[00:55:47.728 --> 00:55:52.473]  How would the air traffic controllers in Europe allow them to set that flight plan?
[00:55:55.616 --> 00:55:56.457]  That's another question.
[00:55:58.419 --> 00:56:03.904]  Airlines can't set the flight plan if it goes through areas that are restricted airspace.
[00:56:05.646 --> 00:56:08.349]  We're going to go to break and come back with Tom in Baltimore.
[00:56:09.875 --> 00:56:12.416]  Works with helicopter units and police wants to talk about it.
[00:56:12.456 --> 00:56:22.081]  And then we're going to get Glenn Spencer on for America Patrol with video Skype at the border across from a drug smuggling base.
[00:56:22.682 --> 00:56:23.762]  It's actually on video.
[00:56:24.963 --> 00:56:26.344]  The Skype was very clear this morning.
[00:56:26.804 --> 00:56:33.047]  We'll see how it is when we go live in the next segment with Glenn Spencer after we take a call or two.
[00:56:33.107 --> 00:56:35.848]  But this is amazing stuff.
[00:56:35.949 --> 00:56:36.429]  By the way,
[00:56:37.597 --> 00:56:38.337]  We've been out.
[00:56:38.437 --> 00:56:40.639]  It's not artificial scarcity, it's scarcity.
[00:56:42.139 --> 00:57:04.171]  The best way to sell something is to have it be a high-quality product and be in demand and be reasonably priced and competitive, but also to have that Christmas toy phenomenon where companies have been caught over and over again, it's been in the news, going and buying up the first ship of their toy, paying off local newscasters to say, oh, you know, this toy is sold out and people are fighting over it.
[00:57:04.411 --> 00:57:05.952]  That will cause a run on it.
[00:57:08.427 --> 00:57:15.352]  Well, that's not what's happened with Survival Shield and then Survival Shield X2 and the other products.
[00:57:15.472 --> 00:57:21.897]  They really have sold out and we really were unable sometimes to get the super high quality product and produce it.
[00:57:22.177 --> 00:57:27.001]  We've been out for two and a half months of the Silver Bullet.
[00:57:28.662 --> 00:57:32.445]  Silver Bullet, I mean, it is the most powerful, hard to get,
[00:57:34.036 --> 00:57:34.896]  Purest silver.
[00:57:35.456 --> 00:57:37.517]  The laboratory we use is the best in the country.
[00:57:37.937 --> 00:57:40.158]  We are neurotic about the highest quality.
[00:57:40.838 --> 00:57:42.838]  And it is less than the leading competitors.
[00:57:42.918 --> 00:57:44.839]  And it is the best coiled silver out there.
[00:57:45.239 --> 00:57:46.800]  It is very strong though, folks.
[00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:48.940]  So, I only use it when I'm sick.
[00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:50.421]  I don't think this is for regular use.
[00:57:50.821 --> 00:57:52.761]  Now, other people, you know, say that.
[00:57:53.461 --> 00:57:54.442]  I don't say that, okay?
[00:57:54.902 --> 00:57:55.962]  And consult your physician.
[00:57:56.402 --> 00:57:57.482]  Silver Bullet is back.
[00:57:57.963 --> 00:57:59.583]  We have a limited supply.
[00:58:00.303 --> 00:58:02.384]  Because it's hard to make this stuff.
[00:58:03.084 --> 00:58:04.125]  And it's dangerous, too.
[00:58:04.625 --> 00:58:05.506]  They use high voltage.
[00:58:06.467 --> 00:58:12.892]  And the lab we're using is a big one, and really nobody else out there can move this much silver.
[00:58:12.992 --> 00:58:16.255]  So, the point is, is that we've got a limited amount.
[00:58:17.265 --> 00:58:19.387]  And they're trying to make us more now.
[00:58:19.447 --> 00:58:21.189]  It'll probably take another two, three months to make it.
[00:58:21.649 --> 00:58:24.953]  I think that the way it sold last time, it'll be sold out in two weeks to a month.
[00:58:25.313 --> 00:58:31.099]  If you want the Silver Bullet or want to stock up on it, Infowarslife.com Colloidal Silver.
[00:58:31.739 --> 00:58:34.182]  I type it topically and internally when I'm sick.
[00:58:34.602 --> 00:58:37.285]  Antibiotics would work on my dad or me this year.
[00:58:37.445 --> 00:58:41.108]  I lost members of my family to the bacterial stuff in the lungs.
[00:58:42.490 --> 00:58:43.331]  I think it saved me.
[00:58:43.351 --> 00:58:45.534]  I mean, it really reversed it.
[00:58:45.714 --> 00:58:46.876]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:58:49.699 --> 00:58:51.561]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:51.722 --> 00:58:52.683]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:52.883 --> 00:58:57.069]  And your purchases fund the operation, so it's a win-win-win-win-win.
[00:58:59.335 --> 00:59:00.497]  I didn't like taste dirt in it.
[00:59:00.597 --> 00:59:01.698]  God knows what's in this.
[00:59:01.939 --> 00:59:06.044]  These people just sampled city of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[00:59:06.204 --> 00:59:12.092]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered through the ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[00:59:12.232 --> 00:59:13.254]  That one is better.
[00:59:13.314 --> 00:59:14.435]  Tastes like nothing.
[00:59:14.575 --> 00:59:15.997]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[00:59:16.037 --> 00:59:16.538]  It's good water.
[00:59:16.638 --> 00:59:22.461]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[00:59:22.701 --> 00:59:29.825]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[00:59:30.025 --> 00:59:32.546]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[00:59:32.746 --> 00:59:40.770]  The ProPureÂ® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[00:59:40.930 --> 00:59:42.231]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[00:59:42.251 --> 00:59:42.991]  It's good water.
[00:59:43.191 --> 00:59:43.632]  Refreshing.
[00:59:43.792 --> 00:59:44.092]  It's good!

[00:59:53.261 --> 00:59:55.443]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.684 --> 01:00:02.210]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:15.185 --> 01:00:19.368]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:20.009 --> 01:00:20.809]  You want answers?
[01:00:21.610 --> 01:00:22.491]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.151 --> 01:00:26.734]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.335 --> 01:00:31.398]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:46.053 --> 01:00:48.934]  I tell you, the border situation is getting absolutely insane.
[01:00:48.954 --> 01:00:51.355]  We'll cover that from the border with video feeds.
[01:00:51.375 --> 01:00:57.777]  If you're a radio listener, infowars.com forward slash show to find the free video feeds and audio feeds and podcasts.
[01:00:58.177 --> 01:01:06.600]  But right now we open the phones up to commercial pilots, Air Force pilots, missile system operators.
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:13.482]  They all concurred with what I know just from the news and doing research and watching Discovery Channel and History Channel and my dad being a pilot.
[01:01:14.645 --> 01:01:20.488]  Flying in the cockpit with other pilots that somebody ordered that plane through that restricted airspace.
[01:01:22.969 --> 01:01:27.632]  Or it's the Malaysian Airlines fault and they're now saying they directed it through there.
[01:01:28.912 --> 01:01:32.034]  But airlines can't direct you through a no-fly zone.
[01:01:33.595 --> 01:01:33.795]  Folks.
[01:01:35.285 --> 01:01:41.790]  When I was a kid, if my dad even got near airspace, they would say, identify yourself when you were three miles away from it.
[01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:44.712]  And he'd say, I'm flying through here, blah, blah, blah, to go here.
[01:01:44.732 --> 01:01:45.373]  And I go, thank you.
[01:01:45.873 --> 01:01:46.974]  You know, just such and such.
[01:01:49.816 --> 01:01:52.778]  And I remember one time there was some storms because they would pop up, you know, in the summer.
[01:01:52.798 --> 01:01:56.221]  And I remember them saying, oh, you can go ahead and fly over our airspace.
[01:01:57.079 --> 01:01:59.060]  You know, fly on heading such and such, such and such.
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:04.363]  But sometimes I'd say, nope, you can't fly, you know, by here and, uh, might have to land, as I said earlier.
[01:02:04.783 --> 01:02:05.624]  That was my experience.
[01:02:05.644 --> 01:02:08.765]  We just confirmed it with all these pilots and air traffic controllers and people.
[01:02:09.546 --> 01:02:11.907]  But again, where are the headlines asking all this?
[01:02:12.708 --> 01:02:16.229]  Uh, let's talk to Tom in Baltimore, then Ron, John and others.
[01:02:16.269 --> 01:02:16.810]  Go ahead, Tom.
[01:02:18.101 --> 01:02:19.282]  Good afternoon, Mr. Jones.
[01:02:19.442 --> 01:02:30.211]  I just want to elaborate a little bit on what one of your previous callers had stated about the jets possibly shuttling that craft over a bit.
[01:02:30.912 --> 01:02:35.656]  I had thought that since day one that that might be a possibility.
[01:02:36.276 --> 01:02:43.102]  I had that in mind because when I was a police officer, we would have a lot of local news helicopters
[01:02:44.029 --> 01:02:47.503]  Figure out from time to time where our tech units are operating.
[01:02:47.864 --> 01:02:48.728]  When I was in tech...
[01:02:50.523 --> 01:02:52.424]  Usually we were doing sensitive operations.
[01:02:52.444 --> 01:02:55.907]  We didn't want them shadowing us everywhere we went.
[01:02:55.927 --> 01:02:57.187]  They were getting away our position.
[01:02:57.588 --> 01:03:04.012]  So we would call one of our helicopters to come and they didn't have to contact them by radio.
[01:03:04.513 --> 01:03:10.837]  They would spot them up at night sometimes or they would just fly by and nudge them.
[01:03:11.137 --> 01:03:16.201]  My thinking is if you've got several fighter jets flying
[01:03:16.881 --> 01:03:18.503]  Aggressively by your plane.
[01:03:18.743 --> 01:03:23.707]  You're not going to have to have any radio contact whatsoever, which might be what they had in mind.
[01:03:24.087 --> 01:03:34.737]  You're going to steer clear of where those fighter jets are operating the same way the news helicopters would clear out when our chopper would buzz them or spot them up.
[01:03:36.178 --> 01:03:37.239]  It makes perfect sense.
[01:03:37.359 --> 01:03:41.642]  And you would have no record of any communication telling them to do anything.
[01:03:41.963 --> 01:03:43.304]  They would just do it.
[01:03:44.266 --> 01:03:44.566]  Wow.
[01:03:45.327 --> 01:03:47.949]  What does your gut overall tell you is going on here?
[01:03:49.891 --> 01:04:00.060]  You know, I'll tell you what, you can't believe anything that you hear from the politicians or the news, or what we used to call it in court, through the poisonous tree.
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:07.526]  You know, once they tell you and feed you so many lies, you can't take anything that they say as factual or truthful at all.
[01:04:07.627 --> 01:04:09.088]  You know, they've done it to themselves.
[01:04:09.208 --> 01:04:11.210]  So it's really a guessing game.
[01:04:12.191 --> 01:04:28.307]  It certainly, though, appears that, like you said, you know, we've traditionally not been big fans this country of Russia, but they certainly seem to be operating in the way that we had always strived to operate.
[01:04:28.827 --> 01:04:34.835]  They're doing things that the United States used to do when I was a younger man.
[01:04:35.456 --> 01:04:37.438]  And I can't fault them for that.
[01:04:37.939 --> 01:04:41.163]  So, you know, right now the credibility has to go with them.
[01:04:41.183 --> 01:04:43.086]  I'm just calling it the way I see it.
[01:04:43.626 --> 01:04:44.087]  I agree with you.
[01:04:44.127 --> 01:04:46.250]  Plus, they don't stand a chance of shooting this airliner down.
[01:04:48.243 --> 01:04:48.643]  We are.
[01:04:49.103 --> 01:04:50.064]  That's a big one right there.
[01:04:50.104 --> 01:04:51.244]  I mean, look who stands to gain.
[01:04:51.524 --> 01:04:53.405]  And how the war propaganda was so ready.
[01:04:53.765 --> 01:04:55.206]  We got Glenn Spencer coming up.
[01:04:55.566 --> 01:04:58.907]  If you guys can hold Ron, John, and Clay, I want to get to you.
[01:04:59.347 --> 01:05:00.908]  Or we can get your number and call you back.
[01:05:00.928 --> 01:05:04.229]  We're gonna go to Glenn Spencer on the border, then the Drudge Report piece.
[01:05:04.629 --> 01:05:06.790]  But I'll get to your calls from Hooker Crook.
[01:05:09.358 --> 01:05:11.922]  Alex Jones here for InfoWars.com.
[01:05:12.162 --> 01:05:17.048]  In the month of July, we have got giant specials on everything at Madein1776.com.
[01:05:17.128 --> 01:05:19.412]  The already discounted Made in 1776 t-shirts are only $17.76.
[01:05:24.258 --> 01:05:28.685]  We have the new belt buckles that in only two weeks of sale are very close to selling out.
[01:05:28.825 --> 01:05:30.487]  There's only 500 of each.
[01:05:30.728 --> 01:05:34.854]  We're talking about made in America belt buckles in nickel brass.
[01:05:34.934 --> 01:05:37.017]  This is more than a summer blowout special.
[01:05:37.197 --> 01:05:40.122]  This is a new declaration of independence.
[01:05:40.322 --> 01:05:46.126]  But to expand the Info Orb, we're offering the equivalent of more than five months free.
[01:05:46.426 --> 01:05:51.770]  Right now, when you get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv, for a limited time, only $39.95 a year.
[01:05:52.070 --> 01:05:55.613]  That's more than five months free off the regular price.
[01:05:55.953 --> 01:05:59.495]  Not just this July 4th weekend, but the entire month of July.
[01:05:59.775 --> 01:06:02.197]  At MadeIn1776.com.
[01:06:02.557 --> 01:06:03.738]  Molon Labe.
[01:06:04.018 --> 01:06:07.641]  You can take my gun from my cold, dead hands.
[01:06:10.231 --> 01:06:11.271]  In the near future.
[01:06:11.571 --> 01:06:15.212]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:06:15.232 --> 01:06:15.712]  Security alert.
[01:06:16.072 --> 01:06:17.073]  Security alert.
[01:06:17.293 --> 01:06:19.033]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:06:19.293 --> 01:06:19.913]  Analysis.
[01:06:20.173 --> 01:06:20.834]  InfoWars.
[01:06:20.894 --> 01:06:22.854]  Building independent media operations.
[01:06:22.874 --> 01:06:27.835]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:06:27.895 --> 01:06:28.835]  Prime Directive.
[01:06:28.915 --> 01:06:30.376]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:06:30.456 --> 01:06:33.236]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:06:33.296 --> 01:06:36.377]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:06:36.557 --> 01:06:38.778]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:06:38.858 --> 01:06:39.578]  These people are a
[01:06:39.778 --> 01:06:41.799]  They're never going to stop.
[01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:48.804]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:06:48.844 --> 01:06:55.449]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:06:56.169 --> 01:07:00.852]  Intellectually it's begun and you can feel it.
[01:07:08.795 --> 01:07:13.539]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[01:07:13.779 --> 01:07:16.861]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[01:07:17.121 --> 01:07:18.943]  She's just not the woman I married.
[01:07:19.243 --> 01:07:21.164]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[01:07:21.384 --> 01:07:22.845]  Does this seem familiar?
[01:07:23.026 --> 01:07:26.088]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[01:07:26.368 --> 01:07:27.689]  If so, consider this.
[01:07:27.949 --> 01:07:36.876]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[01:07:37.216 --> 01:07:43.242]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.
[01:07:43.602 --> 01:07:45.244]  Forget synthetic chemicals.
[01:07:45.644 --> 01:07:53.312]  Super Female Vitality brings forward key herbs specifically chosen for women's biology without the use of phony additives.

[01:08:06.877 --> 01:08:07.957]  Live life healthy.
[01:08:11.958 --> 01:08:17.981]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:18.581 --> 01:08:21.562]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:26.730 --> 01:08:28.712]  I come to you from FEMA Region 6.
[01:08:30.513 --> 01:08:32.215]  That's why we have that intro liner.
[01:08:33.356 --> 01:08:38.220]  Coming to you from deep behind enemy lines at the federal government's run by the Ford Foundation.
[01:08:38.861 --> 01:08:41.323]  For 60 years they've taught in Latin America that the U.S.
[01:08:41.363 --> 01:08:44.445]  is evil and must fall and that socialism is the way to go.
[01:08:45.458 --> 01:08:49.441]  To create an anti-Americanism that can be attached to the Democratic Party.
[01:08:50.181 --> 01:09:05.092]  Now Obama has implemented the planned implosion of the border that Glenn Spencer at AmericanPatrol.com, American Border Patrol, has predicted year after year after year.
[01:09:05.112 --> 01:09:10.196]  You've heard him here, I don't know, at least 12, 13 years, no longer than that.
[01:09:10.216 --> 01:09:11.277]  He's been coming on about 15 years.
[01:09:13.491 --> 01:09:18.014]  And he's the first guy to launch drones on the border, even before the government did.
[01:09:18.034 --> 01:09:20.875]  He moved from California right there to Arizona.
[01:09:21.115 --> 01:09:23.957]  We have an incredible video feed if you're a listener on the radio.
[01:09:24.357 --> 01:09:31.741]  You can go to Infowars.com forward slash show if you're near a computer or have one of your quote smartphones and you can see the HD video.
[01:09:31.801 --> 01:09:34.442]  I mean his Skype is just incredibly clear.
[01:09:35.083 --> 01:09:41.486]  And you can see the Mexican border right behind him and the drug cartel smuggling shack for people and drugs.
[01:09:42.387 --> 01:09:42.507]  And
[01:09:43.786 --> 01:09:55.328]  He has predicted this all along, a collapse of the border, the de facto amnesty causing a giant flood, and then race war being implemented as the next phase to break the country up.
[01:09:56.208 --> 01:10:00.389]  He's warned of Mecha, La Raza, all of it, and the Spanish media is promoting this.
[01:10:01.169 --> 01:10:12.351]  Most Hispanics that I know are just absolutely against this, and are very patriotic Americans, but the Latin Americans and the Mexicans, a large percentage of them, just really believe it.
[01:10:13.414 --> 01:10:15.516]  And they've been sold that it's kosher and acceptable.
[01:10:15.556 --> 01:10:29.430]  So he joins us now from the border to break down what's happening there now, Glenn Spencer, but also to give us his take on how he predicted this in hundreds of articles, videos, and thousands of interviews.
[01:10:29.530 --> 01:10:30.351]  Dozens of them here.
[01:10:30.711 --> 01:10:32.072]  He's probably been with us over a hundred times.
[01:10:32.433 --> 01:10:35.516]  Glenn, I tell you, when I first started interviewing you back in like
[01:10:37.021 --> 01:10:38.022]  1999 and stuff.
[01:10:39.364 --> 01:10:41.265]  I thought you were out there even for my show.
[01:10:41.786 --> 01:10:43.727]  And boy, you know what you're talking about, buddy.
[01:10:45.769 --> 01:10:49.593]  Well, Alex, you're spot on and your introduction and the Ford Foundation.
[01:10:49.673 --> 01:10:51.795]  I think it's even worse than what you said.
[01:10:51.815 --> 01:10:54.177]  Thanks for having me on.
[01:10:54.357 --> 01:11:00.963]  And hello from the from the Arizona-Mexico border and over my right shoulder and to your left.
[01:11:01.682 --> 01:11:03.603]  You might be able to see a building down there.
[01:11:03.623 --> 01:11:09.345]  That is a warehouse used by the Mexican cartels to store their drugs.
[01:11:11.086 --> 01:11:17.908]  Let's talk a little bit about where you live and what you've seen and then get your expert take on what this Obama operation is.
[01:11:18.068 --> 01:11:30.013]  Our reporters proved five weeks ago with DrugsReport.com that indeed the Border Patrol gets them off the buses, loads them on buses, gives them vouchers and drops them wherever they want to go inside the interior.
[01:11:30.836 --> 01:11:31.096]  Right.
[01:11:31.556 --> 01:11:33.877]  Well, I'm on the Mexican border.
[01:11:34.337 --> 01:11:35.057]  I have a ranch.
[01:11:35.917 --> 01:11:38.738]  I gave up on California 12 years ago, Alex.
[01:11:39.258 --> 01:11:42.039]  I came out here to do the battle right on the front line.
[01:11:42.739 --> 01:11:45.680]  I ended up with a ranch a little over 100 acres right here.
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.961]  My neighbor to the south is Mexico.
[01:11:50.366 --> 01:12:05.675]  What you see in the back of me is the San Pedro River that flows out of Mexico north to the Gila River then into the Colorado and it is a major smuggling corridor.
[01:12:05.735 --> 01:12:08.256]  Right now there are probably people in there carrying drugs.
[01:12:10.507 --> 01:12:15.591]  What I have done since I started down here, we started up American Border Patrol, and you're right.
[01:12:16.571 --> 01:12:23.076]  We patrol the border, we send video, we were the first to use unmanned aerial vehicles here on the border.
[01:12:23.116 --> 01:12:25.998]  We are the reason the U.S.
[01:12:26.038 --> 01:12:31.061]  Border Patrol started using them, because we embarrassed them about 10 years ago, 11 years ago.
[01:12:32.443 --> 01:12:33.765]  We shamed them into doing it.
[01:12:33.805 --> 01:12:34.828]  We've done a lot of things.
[01:12:34.868 --> 01:12:41.201]  Of course, you'll never know about us because the mainstream media refuse to report on what we do.
[01:12:42.899 --> 01:12:46.982]  If you go on AmericanBorderPatrol.com and you look over to the left, you'll see a little red arrow.
[01:12:47.002 --> 01:12:55.089]  If you click on that, people are amazed that what opens up is a map of the Southwest and every one of the Border Patrol sectors.
[01:12:55.109 --> 01:13:04.616]  Now you can click on a sector and a map will pop up and you can see a code that shows what's on the border, what kind of fence is down there.
[01:13:04.896 --> 01:13:09.180]  Then you'll see little dots, little numbers, and you can click on that and you can get an actual
[01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:20.146]  This aerial photograph of what the border fence looks like from Brownsville, Texas, the Gulf of Mexico, all the way out to the Pacific Ocean.
[01:13:20.486 --> 01:13:22.807]  This is the best-kept secret in America.
[01:13:23.408 --> 01:13:27.750]  And people go in, and they click on that, and their mouths drop open.
[01:13:28.050 --> 01:13:30.872]  They say, that's not a fence, you can step right over it.
[01:13:31.392 --> 01:13:34.654]  Most of what is down there is just that.
[01:13:34.734 --> 01:13:37.035]  Now my neighbor over here, John Ladd,
[01:13:37.535 --> 01:13:41.876]  He has 10 miles of frontage on the Mexican border.
[01:13:42.476 --> 01:13:49.418]  They built a fence that is so cheap you can cut through it in 20 minutes.
[01:13:51.399 --> 01:13:52.639]  John is a good friend of mine.
[01:13:53.379 --> 01:13:54.620]  He has had in the last 18 months
[01:13:56.828 --> 01:14:09.422]  42 times they have cut through his fence, driven drugs loads across his ranch, cut fences, his cows are all over the place, and they caught one load.
[01:14:10.581 --> 01:14:11.502]  Never caught anybody.
[01:14:11.942 --> 01:14:12.662]  So that'll tell you.
[01:14:12.702 --> 01:14:18.785]  That's right there, a major drug cartel smuggling operation Americans don't know about.
[01:14:18.805 --> 01:14:37.915]  And now in Texas, it's reported today by Fox News, the Border Patrol was fired on by automatic weapons fire, suppressive fire, to get the shipments of illegals across, I guess to be delivered to the Border Patrol, and the Border Patrol basically had to run and hide, and reportedly the rules of engagement are just stand down,
[01:14:38.715 --> 01:14:40.517]  And let the drug cartels attack you.
[01:14:41.097 --> 01:14:42.699]  I mean, this is just out of control.
[01:14:43.219 --> 01:14:44.901]  There's sitting ducks in the river there.
[01:14:45.582 --> 01:14:47.764]  You know, we just flew down there.
[01:14:48.284 --> 01:14:53.529]  I was down in June and I went back last week with a local photographer from our newspaper here.
[01:14:53.609 --> 01:14:57.333]  I hired him to go with me because we couldn't believe what we saw.
[01:14:57.413 --> 01:14:58.694]  I took a GoPro camera.
[01:14:59.352 --> 01:15:05.156]  And flew along the Rio Grande River in my Cessna 206, hanging up on the wing.
[01:15:05.716 --> 01:15:08.278]  And I got back and I looked at that video and I said, what?
[01:15:08.698 --> 01:15:13.701]  First of all, I flew for 40 miles and saw one border patrol, a patrol boat.
[01:15:14.241 --> 01:15:15.062]  But I got back.
[01:15:16.521 --> 01:15:20.064]  I saw all these... there are fences on top of the levee.
[01:15:20.104 --> 01:15:28.632]  Remember, a levee is there to stop the river from running off of its banks and flooding the inland farms and towns.
[01:15:29.193 --> 01:15:31.455]  Now, a levee can also be used to stop...
[01:15:32.015 --> 01:15:44.313]  People from flooding over the banks of the river, and they actually started back in 2007 to build fences on top of those levees, and they spent hundreds of millions of dollars doing that.
[01:15:44.333 --> 01:15:48.159]  I was there, we did an aerial survey, part of our Operation Beef.
[01:15:49.293 --> 01:15:50.734]  Back in 2009.
[01:15:51.115 --> 01:15:54.857]  And you can go on, American Border Patrol, and look at that map I was telling you about.
[01:15:55.378 --> 01:16:00.341]  Look at some of those pictures of the immense, enormous construction projects.
[01:16:01.062 --> 01:16:07.586]  They were building up the walls next to the levee, then backfilling them, so they could have a fence, and that would stop everybody.
[01:16:07.766 --> 01:16:15.852]  Well, I went back with my GoPro camera and I flew along, and here were all these fences, but there were huge gaps in them.
[01:16:16.559 --> 01:16:35.547]  And I couldn't figure out what they were so I took a photographer with a zoom lens and we went back there and we found out after landing and talking to some border patrol agents and getting some ground photographs there were supposed to be electric gates installed on those fences.
[01:16:36.527 --> 01:16:37.968]  But Obama didn't install them.
[01:16:41.405 --> 01:16:46.067]  Every quarter of a mile, there's a hole in the fence 40 feet wide!
[01:16:46.227 --> 01:16:47.268]  And again, let's be clear.
[01:16:47.768 --> 01:16:51.130]  Latin America is literally collapsing right now.
[01:16:51.730 --> 01:16:53.311]  Our country is going into a depression.
[01:16:53.551 --> 01:16:56.453]  Glenn, I want to pull back though and talk about the big picture.
[01:16:56.573 --> 01:17:02.676]  You predicted that they would just dissolve the border and that it would cause a giant flood years ago.
[01:17:03.296 --> 01:17:06.398]  So tell us what's happening currently and what you predict will happen next.
[01:17:07.301 --> 01:17:24.829]  Well, before he was elected, and you can go on my site and you can see my quote, I said, before he was elected the first time back in 2008, I said, Barack Obama is the most dangerous person ever to set foot on the American political stage.
[01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:28.911]  His election to presidency would amount to national suicide.
[01:17:30.012 --> 01:17:36.515]  And that's because I studied him and I know the subject and I know how close he was to the National Council of La Raza.
[01:17:37.370 --> 01:17:41.391]  I know how he was trained by Saul Alinsky and that crowd.
[01:17:41.831 --> 01:17:44.611]  And I knew that he was embedded with these people.
[01:17:45.012 --> 01:17:48.392]  And I knew what he was going to do before he was elected.
[01:17:48.432 --> 01:17:50.012]  Too bad John McCain didn't know it.
[01:17:50.753 --> 01:17:53.713]  Now, talk about the current thrust.
[01:17:54.373 --> 01:18:02.675]  Back in August of 2012, he passed this Deferred Action for Children of Alias, DACA.
[01:18:03.371 --> 01:18:08.832]  Now, we had a friend that monitors the border traffic down south of Tucson.
[01:18:09.432 --> 01:18:14.333]  And they were getting about 10, in this little area, about 10 actions per day.
[01:18:14.953 --> 01:18:18.194]  After August 15, 2012, it jumped to over 100 per day.
[01:18:18.274 --> 01:18:20.475]  And that was a result of this DACA action.
[01:18:27.536 --> 01:18:39.202]  And even the next year, a senator, a Mexican female senator, came out and said, we're having people rush for the border because of this new policy.
[01:18:39.942 --> 01:18:45.505]  And Senator Cruz was on Fox News Sunday yesterday.
[01:18:46.105 --> 01:18:51.869]  And he pointed out, he said this has nothing to do with the 2008 law signed by Bush.
[01:18:52.249 --> 01:18:59.374]  This has everything to do with that DACA announcement and the word that he spread around the world, south of the border.
[01:18:59.534 --> 01:19:06.039]  Sure, and it turns out there's a deal with Guatemala and Mexico to have Mexico open up its border, something it's never done before.
[01:19:06.959 --> 01:19:13.884]  And so I guess the big plan is to get so many tens of millions of new people up here, they just end the border completely, North American Union.
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:15.401]  No question about it.
[01:19:15.741 --> 01:19:16.922]  That is the plan.
[01:19:17.242 --> 01:19:31.254]  And there are other detailed things where he has passed regulations and issued orders that the Border Patrol is not to touch anyone who happens to have a child who is an illegal alien in their custody, even though they're illegal.
[01:19:31.674 --> 01:19:38.440]  So he has passed a multitude of presidential orders that essentially dissolve our borders.
[01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:40.722]  And it allows the exploitation of children.
[01:19:40.782 --> 01:19:41.783]  No one knows who they are.
[01:19:42.543 --> 01:19:44.764]  I mean, this is such a crime on so many fronts.
[01:19:45.444 --> 01:19:46.224]  It's incredible.
[01:19:46.264 --> 01:19:47.344]  This is true lawlessness.
[01:19:47.364 --> 01:19:52.065]  Glenn Spencer, AmericanBorderPatrol.com, the best site out there.
[01:19:52.085 --> 01:19:56.346]  The incredible intel, the research, the clips he's got of all the racist stuff.
[01:19:56.386 --> 01:19:58.427]  Mecha and La Raza say it's incredible.
[01:19:59.127 --> 01:20:04.888]  And it's, boy, I tell you, we're going to come back and see what other intel he's got for us on the other side.
[01:20:05.448 --> 01:20:06.088]  Stay with us.
[01:20:06.148 --> 01:20:06.629]  We'll be back.

[01:23:51.192 --> 01:23:56.775]  My Magic Mud detoxifies, reduces sensitivity, cleans and strengthens your teeth while it whitens.
[01:23:57.195 --> 01:23:59.617]  Comes as a powder for pure whitening power.
[01:23:59.997 --> 01:24:01.998]  Start looking good for that special someone.
[01:24:02.378 --> 01:24:03.419]  Get the mud now.
[01:24:03.799 --> 01:24:04.960]  MyMagicMud.com
[01:24:13.659 --> 01:24:17.840]  Every breath you take, every move you make, the NSA is watching you in the Big Truman Show.
[01:24:18.821 --> 01:24:22.222]  That is our supposedly free society, but they won't control our borders.
[01:24:23.122 --> 01:24:28.824]  The TSA has got to check your baby's diaper for a bomb, but the illegal aliens get to walk right through without any papers.
[01:24:30.864 --> 01:24:33.385]  Because we have a lawless, out-of-control government.
[01:24:34.286 --> 01:24:41.808]  And my show's gone from being radical now to almost passÃ©, because everything we've talked about is coming true, unfortunately.
[01:24:43.285 --> 01:24:43.425]  I can't.
[01:24:43.445 --> 01:24:45.726]  But the good news is there is a massive wake-up happening.
[01:24:47.167 --> 01:24:52.009]  Glenn, I want to get you back on for a full hour in the next few weeks now that you've got great internet there.
[01:24:52.029 --> 01:24:53.049]  Your Skype is incredible.
[01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:58.712]  And I'd love to send out Staff Sergeant Retired Joe Biggs, because he's got the courage to do what you do, go right down on the border.
[01:24:59.232 --> 01:25:03.694]  In the next few weeks, if you can give him a tour down there, as I know you've given a lot of other media.
[01:25:03.734 --> 01:25:09.577]  But in the six minutes we've got left, you've got the floor to tell us what's coming next, how we can stop this.
[01:25:11.056 --> 01:25:22.029]  Where we're going from here, because if we thought that the earlier flood was bad, I'm predicting the next flood's gonna be even bigger, and then bigger, and then Obama will use the crisis to federalize the Southwest.
[01:25:23.365 --> 01:25:29.651]  Alright Alex, a lot of people complain about the problem and report on the problem, but what we've been focusing on are solutions.
[01:25:30.172 --> 01:25:36.498]  Whether it was our unmanned aerial vehicle, our special cameras, our survey, but we have come up with a solution.
[01:25:36.979 --> 01:25:41.443]  We have the solution to this system, we call it the Sonic Barrier or Identisize.
[01:25:42.164 --> 01:25:45.747]  And we invented this, patent is pending, should be issued shortly.
[01:25:46.228 --> 01:25:47.189]  We have a system.
[01:25:47.774 --> 01:25:59.985]  That can be buried in the ground, solar powered, cannot be seen, that will count everybody who crosses the border and alert where they are and how many.
[01:26:00.005 --> 01:26:02.887]  It will detect ultralight aircraft.
[01:26:03.227 --> 01:26:04.969]  It is the cheapest thing going.
[01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:06.971]  We have developed it.
[01:26:07.871 --> 01:26:11.294]  I actually had to set up a private company because we had to patent it.
[01:26:11.635 --> 01:26:13.957]  Now remember, you've been working on this, what, five, six years?
[01:26:14.517 --> 01:26:15.218]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:26:17.079 --> 01:26:19.481]  I've been working on the idea for 12 years.
[01:26:20.281 --> 01:26:33.951]  I ran a seismic oil exploration company in Montana, financed it, started it up, ran it successfully for Arco, Chevron, and Texaco, and it is an application of oil exploration seismic technology.
[01:26:34.471 --> 01:26:38.314]  You can go on bordertechnology.com and look at that video.
[01:26:38.374 --> 01:26:39.295]  It'll blow your mind.
[01:26:39.935 --> 01:26:42.117]  But the media will not tell you.
[01:26:42.157 --> 01:26:43.438]  We have a solution to the border.
[01:26:44.071 --> 01:26:54.897]  We can detect and identify everybody who crosses the border from San Diego to Brownsville at a fraction of the cost of what they're using today.
[01:26:55.257 --> 01:27:00.220]  We can do it and I hope your guy comes down and visits us and we'll show him demonstrations.
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:04.743]  I'll fly the ultralight aircraft over the system and an alarm will go off.
[01:27:04.763 --> 01:27:09.726]  Oh yeah, listen, you tell us when we get off the phone here or the video in a minute and we will come
[01:27:11.047 --> 01:27:13.869]  And we will definitely come next week.
[01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:18.614]  I'll send Joe Biggs and one of our camera people there next week for a couple days.
[01:27:18.654 --> 01:27:19.755]  You can give us all the tour.
[01:27:20.296 --> 01:27:22.057]  We'll do live feeds from there with you.
[01:27:22.858 --> 01:27:28.304]  But I remember you told me about this six, seven years ago and all the military people you've got on your board.
[01:27:29.024 --> 01:27:31.567]  Isn't this based on military type technology?
[01:27:31.587 --> 01:27:33.509]  No, it's oil.
[01:27:33.669 --> 01:27:34.470]  Oil company, but yeah.
[01:27:35.435 --> 01:27:36.056]  Let me say this.
[01:27:36.696 --> 01:27:43.041]  One of the big five DOD contractors has been working on this with us for 18 months.
[01:27:43.582 --> 01:27:45.664]  They say it's the best thing they've ever seen.
[01:27:46.124 --> 01:27:47.285]  But they're frightened!
[01:27:48.286 --> 01:27:51.449]  They actually recommended that the U.S.
[01:27:51.509 --> 01:27:54.051]  Border Patrol use this technology down in Texas.
[01:27:54.771 --> 01:27:57.294]  And after they recommended it, they stopped talking to us.
[01:27:58.355 --> 01:28:02.198]  Now you have to understand, this is the best damn system anybody's ever thought of.
[01:28:03.474 --> 01:28:06.676]  I can prove it to your guy who comes down, I can show him all the private documents.
[01:28:06.696 --> 01:28:12.419]  I know, I know, I know, because I know the military special ops and people use seismic stuff to track.
[01:28:12.439 --> 01:28:18.842]  I got an email from Aramco, Saudi Aramco, asking us to bring this system over there.
[01:28:19.542 --> 01:28:28.207]  Now, this is the best, but you won't see it anywhere because it is so good that the government is frightened to death of it.
[01:28:29.039 --> 01:28:29.760]  No, I understand.
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:40.648]  I mean, seismic is one of the most accurate gauges out there, and they can pick up, they know the human pattern, the computer knows the fingerprint, and they'll know how many people, where they're at, and just boom, right there.
[01:28:40.668 --> 01:28:44.070]  No, but see, ours is, this is a patented approach.
[01:28:44.110 --> 01:28:48.254]  We can detect one person walking 600 feet away.
[01:28:48.474 --> 01:28:48.714]  Wow.
[01:28:51.716 --> 01:28:55.779]  The Border Patrol uses seismic sensors, they use one per sensor.
[01:28:55.859 --> 01:28:56.140]  We use 12.
[01:28:58.091 --> 01:28:59.252]  240 foot wide ear.
[01:28:59.272 --> 01:29:02.295]  We use a powerful algorithm.
[01:29:03.155 --> 01:29:04.897]  Stuff that nobody's ever thought of before.
[01:29:05.703 --> 01:29:07.804]  We can detect ultralight.
[01:29:08.405 --> 01:29:10.126]  Our government cannot detect ultralights.
[01:29:10.306 --> 01:29:14.248]  They're coming over maybe 150, 200 a year just in Arizona.
[01:29:14.688 --> 01:29:15.529]  They can't detect them.
[01:29:15.829 --> 01:29:17.009]  They know we can detect them.
[01:29:17.029 --> 01:29:19.251]  Well, look at how Barrett got made in a guy's garage.
[01:29:19.311 --> 01:29:21.052]  It's inventors and scientists like you.
[01:29:21.992 --> 01:29:23.413]  Glenn Spencer, you really are amazing.
[01:29:23.453 --> 01:29:29.176]  I mean, there you were making all that money at an oil company, and then you decided to fight for national sovereignty.
[01:29:30.097 --> 01:29:30.977]  What was that, like 15 years ago?
[01:29:30.997 --> 01:29:31.377]  20 years ago?
[01:29:33.547 --> 01:29:37.170]  Alex, I found out how to make a small fortune on the border.
[01:29:38.110 --> 01:29:39.191]  Start with a large one.
[01:29:40.452 --> 01:29:44.815]  Hey, listen, I'm going to get Rob Duda to call you in a few minutes.
[01:29:45.095 --> 01:29:49.798]  I want to set up sending our guy there next week and we'll have you on with our crew.
[01:29:49.818 --> 01:29:51.059]  Glenn Spencer, thank you so much.
[01:29:51.359 --> 01:29:52.740]  AmericanBorderPatrol.com.
[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:53.800]  Thanks a lot.
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:54.441]  Thank you so much.
[01:29:54.481 --> 01:29:56.082]  We'll be right back with the Matt Drudge special.
[01:29:58.361 --> 01:30:01.363]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.284 --> 01:30:09.549]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.569 --> 01:30:15.433]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:30:15.653 --> 01:30:19.856]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:30:20.217 --> 01:30:24.780]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:27.782]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:30:28.103 --> 01:30:33.287]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:30:33.568 --> 01:30:40.434]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:30:40.934 --> 01:30:44.717]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:30:45.078 --> 01:30:49.862]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:50.202 --> 01:30:51.043]  This is innovating.
[01:30:51.323 --> 01:30:58.630]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:30:58.790 --> 01:31:02.854]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[01:31:03.054 --> 01:31:08.519]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:09.059 --> 01:31:16.125]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:31:16.245 --> 01:31:18.407]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:31:18.587 --> 01:31:23.692]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:31:23.872 --> 01:31:28.816]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:31:29.016 --> 01:31:32.077]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:31:32.337 --> 01:31:36.199]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:31:36.419 --> 01:31:40.661]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:31:40.741 --> 01:31:50.765]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:31:50.965 --> 01:31:53.486]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:31:54.547 --> 01:32:01.732]  The new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:32:01.892 --> 01:32:05.854]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:32:09.670 --> 01:32:11.451]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grote.
[01:32:11.972 --> 01:32:18.936]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[01:32:19.396 --> 01:32:29.803]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[01:32:30.224 --> 01:32:39.470]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[01:32:40.190 --> 01:32:43.611]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[01:32:44.251 --> 01:32:47.692]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[01:32:48.012 --> 01:32:49.593]  Experience the new formula.
[01:32:50.073 --> 01:32:52.054]  Experience the ancient purity.
[01:32:52.654 --> 01:32:53.654]  Shield your family.
[01:32:53.974 --> 01:32:55.375]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:32:55.795 --> 01:32:58.396]  Available now at Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:58.956 --> 01:33:02.917]  X2 from Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:33:19.401 --> 01:33:25.658]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.311 --> 01:33:49.960]  We'll continue to look at the latest economic news, NSA news, military news, DASA news, after we take more of your phone calls with pilots and others calling in, all agreeing so far that no, they had to direct that plane into that war zone to be shot down, and that that's the real scandal.
[01:33:51.301 --> 01:33:52.482]  People say, why are you defending Russia?
[01:33:52.842 --> 01:33:54.102]  I just go where the truth is.
[01:33:54.543 --> 01:33:55.703]  My job is really easy.
[01:33:56.564 --> 01:34:00.346]  I mean, if I even halfway hold back on something, I can't sleep at night, folks.
[01:34:01.328 --> 01:34:02.269]  I'm that kind of person.
[01:34:02.309 --> 01:34:03.590]  Call it goody two-shoes, whatever.
[01:34:04.130 --> 01:34:09.514]  I just have real problems lying to people or distorting things, even if it hurts me.
[01:34:10.955 --> 01:34:11.715]  Even if it hurts me.
[01:34:14.537 --> 01:34:17.339]  So, I'm just going where the truth is.
[01:34:17.539 --> 01:34:18.680]  That's what makes me feel good.
[01:34:19.701 --> 01:34:20.542]  And I guess I'm selfish.
[01:34:20.582 --> 01:34:24.524]  You know, I should go along with Hillary and Obama and want a war with Russia.
[01:34:26.246 --> 01:34:28.227]  I guess, you know, we need a new world war, I guess.
[01:34:28.567 --> 01:34:29.248]  I'm a bad person.
[01:34:29.268 --> 01:34:29.748]  I apologize.
[01:34:31.297 --> 01:34:37.140]  I want to go to this special report that I put together with Darren McBreen, talking about Matt Drudge.
[01:34:37.421 --> 01:34:38.942]  And I intro it.
[01:34:41.343 --> 01:34:47.427]  But the reason I'm doing this is because we have to celebrate heroes of independence.
[01:34:47.967 --> 01:34:50.748]  Heroes of the little guy, the underdog, dominating.
[01:34:51.409 --> 01:34:52.690]  That's what America is about.
[01:34:52.990 --> 01:34:54.291]  That's what Renaissance is about.
[01:34:54.611 --> 01:34:55.731]  That's what freedom's about.
[01:34:56.012 --> 01:34:58.033]  That's where almost everything good comes from.
[01:34:59.142 --> 01:35:09.589]  And Matt Drudge literally has changed the course of history with the type of news he covers and carries so that the establishment, the New York Times and MSNBC can't set the narrative.
[01:35:09.849 --> 01:35:11.270]  And the Pentagon talks about this.
[01:35:13.186 --> 01:35:14.627]  The Pentagon talks about this.
[01:35:15.548 --> 01:35:21.333]  So that's why I've gone back to this speech from the archives and then backed it up with documentation.
[01:35:21.653 --> 01:35:27.338]  After we air it here, we'll post the video for everybody at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and I'll tweet it out as well.
[01:35:27.718 --> 01:35:28.599]  But I'm premiering it here.
[01:35:28.639 --> 01:35:29.680]  It's not up on YouTube yet.
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:30.881]  It'll be up there in about an hour.
[01:35:31.601 --> 01:35:32.062]  Here it is.
[01:35:32.162 --> 01:35:34.804]  Matt Drudge predicted the future.
[01:35:34.944 --> 01:35:36.725]  Matt Drudge, top futurist.
[01:35:36.745 --> 01:35:37.106]  Here it is.
[01:35:38.829 --> 01:35:47.114]  It's been more than 16 years since Matt Drudge gave his historic speech at the National Press Club on June 2nd, 1998.
[01:35:48.414 --> 01:35:58.040]  At that time, he said that the mainstream media would go bankrupt, that individual bloggers and researchers on the internet were just as important as the New York Times.
[01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:03.882]  The controlled state-run media had a field day making fun of Matt Drudge.
[01:36:04.362 --> 01:36:10.665]  But today, their hubris has drained away, and they're no longer as arrogant as they once were.
[01:36:11.085 --> 01:36:15.587]  Now we see calls for the FCC to regulate print news and online news.
[01:36:16.007 --> 01:36:26.471]  And we see establishment publications like Time Magazine, Newsweek, and the New York Times battling to keep from going completely bankrupt and imploding.
[01:36:27.111 --> 01:36:33.816]  It turns out, pretty much everything that Matt Drudge said in that 40-minute speech has now come true.
[01:36:34.277 --> 01:36:39.321]  Well, Matt Drudge is saying a lot of things today that the mainstream media is still laughing at.
[01:36:39.861 --> 01:36:43.684]  Why do they laugh at people that have been proven right over and over again?
[01:36:44.104 --> 01:36:48.548]  Here are some of the most important moments, in my view, from Drudge's speech.
[01:36:48.868 --> 01:36:55.053]  And we're also adding headlines from over the years to show just how much of what he had to say came true.
[01:36:55.493 --> 01:36:56.334]  This is something new.
[01:36:58.379 --> 01:37:06.636]  This marks the first time that an individual has access to the news wires outside of a newsroom.
[01:37:08.666 --> 01:37:18.411]  You get to read all the news from the Associated Press, UPI, Reuters, to the Morrocan Agency French Press and the Genois.
[01:37:18.971 --> 01:37:21.032]  I'm a personal fan of the Genois Press.
[01:37:22.793 --> 01:37:28.236]  And time was, only newsrooms had access to the full pictures of the day's events.
[01:37:29.417 --> 01:37:30.637]  But now any citizen does.
[01:37:32.718 --> 01:37:37.541]  We get to see the kinds of cuts that are made for all kinds of reasons.
[01:37:38.815 --> 01:37:47.818]  Endless layers of editors with endless agendas changing bits and pieces so by the time the newspaper hits your welcome mat, it had no meaning.
[01:37:49.438 --> 01:37:53.319]  Now with a modem, anyone can follow the world and report on the world.
[01:37:54.359 --> 01:37:56.480]  No middleman, no big brother.
[01:37:58.769 --> 01:38:00.130]  And I guess this changes everything.
[01:38:00.490 --> 01:38:09.056]  More than 10 years after breaking the Clinton-Lewinsky story, Matt Drudge remains more powerful than ever with his website, thedrudgereport.com.
[01:38:09.076 --> 01:38:11.158]  Matt Drudge is a legend on the internet.
[01:38:11.338 --> 01:38:15.241]  Every journalist and politician in America reads his website on a daily basis.
[01:38:15.741 --> 01:38:18.023]  When radio lost out to television,
[01:38:19.611 --> 01:38:20.592]  There was anxiety.
[01:38:21.893 --> 01:38:30.900]  The people in the radio business were absolutely anxious and demanded government stop the upcoming television wave.
[01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:36.945]  Television was very nervous about other mediums coming forward.
[01:38:36.985 --> 01:38:37.385]  Cable.
[01:38:39.146 --> 01:38:44.651]  The movies didn't want sitcoms to be taped at movie studios for fear it would take away from the movies.
[01:38:46.084 --> 01:38:46.344]  No.
[01:38:46.885 --> 01:38:48.266]  Television saved the movies.
[01:38:48.646 --> 01:38:51.128]  The internet is going to save the news business.
[01:38:55.011 --> 01:38:58.053]  I envision a future where there'll be 300 million reporters.
[01:39:00.543 --> 01:39:03.264]  For anyone from anywhere can report for any reason.
[01:39:03.984 --> 01:39:06.925]  It's freedom of participation absolutely realized.
[01:39:07.145 --> 01:39:10.826]  First of all, you disrespected me, this badge, and my department.
[01:39:11.466 --> 01:39:12.126]  You understand me?
[01:39:12.346 --> 01:39:15.727]  When I'm talking to you, you shut your mouth and you listen.
[01:39:15.907 --> 01:39:17.308]  Did I not give you a warning?
[01:39:17.328 --> 01:39:18.188]  You gave me a warning.
[01:39:18.208 --> 01:39:18.528]  Okay.
[01:39:18.548 --> 01:39:19.868]  I have a right in the United States.
[01:39:20.068 --> 01:39:20.949]  I know my rights.
[01:39:21.109 --> 01:39:21.769]  I don't give it.
[01:39:21.849 --> 01:39:23.369]  I don't care.
[01:39:23.649 --> 01:39:24.489]  Give me the board.
[01:39:24.690 --> 01:39:29.911]  Obviously, your parents don't put a foot in your butt quite enough because you don't understand the meaning of respect.
[01:39:32.802 --> 01:39:33.343]  You see this?
[01:39:33.883 --> 01:39:34.844]  Yes, you see this.
[01:39:35.064 --> 01:39:35.945]  I took the boy.
[01:39:36.225 --> 01:39:37.567]  You have a problem with it?
[01:39:37.707 --> 01:39:38.648]  I have a problem.
[01:39:38.668 --> 01:39:39.909]  Then bring your parents down.
[01:39:40.109 --> 01:39:40.930]  We'll discuss this.
[01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:41.350]  All right.
[01:39:41.871 --> 01:39:42.471]  Go for it.
[01:39:42.752 --> 01:39:45.254]  Have you been there for the ceremony with the cremation of Care?
[01:39:46.736 --> 01:39:49.739]  Frankly, I don't think that's something I need to talk to you about.
[01:39:50.379 --> 01:39:50.619]  Really?
[01:39:50.759 --> 01:39:51.160]  That's right.
[01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:53.942]  Well, I'm Alex Jones and I snuck in there in 2000.
[01:39:54.182 --> 01:39:57.485]  I'm the guy that blew it wide open and got the video and it's been on national TV.
[01:39:57.705 --> 01:39:59.026]  Well, I disrespect you for that.
[01:39:59.426 --> 01:39:59.767]  You do?
[01:39:59.907 --> 01:40:00.127]  I do.
[01:40:00.147 --> 01:40:02.529]  But there's a lot of big public officials going in there.
[01:40:02.749 --> 01:40:04.050]  Don't we deserve to know?
[01:40:04.110 --> 01:40:06.572]  I don't know anything about you and I don't know anything about your film.
[01:40:06.912 --> 01:40:11.036]  But if you go in there with an understanding, you violated that understanding by releasing that film and I don't respect you for that.
[01:40:11.656 --> 01:40:13.318]  Really?
[01:40:13.438 --> 01:40:16.941]  I'm sorry, you took an understanding when you went in there that you would not do that film.
[01:40:17.081 --> 01:40:18.983]  Did you have an understanding when you went in there?
[01:40:19.003 --> 01:40:19.063]  No.
[01:40:19.244 --> 01:40:19.904]  Did you crash it?
[01:40:20.245 --> 01:40:20.485]  Yes.
[01:40:20.725 --> 01:40:22.847]  Yeah, and it has no trespassing signs there too, doesn't it?
[01:40:22.867 --> 01:40:24.168]  No, they put them up after.
[01:40:24.188 --> 01:40:24.889]  I just walked in.
[01:40:24.909 --> 01:40:26.230]  I'm sorry, sir, I've been there before.
[01:40:26.290 --> 01:40:30.414]  I know what the circumstances are, and I'm sorry you violated the understandings.
[01:40:30.575 --> 01:40:32.036]  That was not a gentlemanly thing to do.
[01:40:32.056 --> 01:40:32.817]  But what about the ritual?
[01:40:32.857 --> 01:40:33.978]  Is the ritual gentlemanly?
[01:40:41.747 --> 01:40:45.250]  Sir, I don't owe you this comment.
[01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:46.891]  I know, I'm pretty sure.
[01:40:47.372 --> 01:40:51.375]  This is what's called ambush journalism, and I disrespect you for that as well, so thank you and goodbye.
[01:40:51.395 --> 01:40:52.276]  Have you ever been in the original?
[01:40:52.996 --> 01:40:54.277]  That's none of your damn business.
[01:40:55.038 --> 01:40:56.559]  Oh!
[01:40:57.099 --> 01:40:58.160]  Listen, listen.
[01:40:58.841 --> 01:41:02.484]  You go around and make understandings with people and violate them.
[01:41:03.324 --> 01:41:07.528]  You ambush people on the streets, and that's an inappropriate form of journalism.
[01:41:07.728 --> 01:41:10.991]  If you wish to practice that, that's fine, but don't ask others to respect you for it.
[01:41:11.883 --> 01:41:14.224]  You can do your free American like anything you want.
[01:41:14.504 --> 01:41:17.585]  If you want to be uncivil and rude and ungentlemanly, that's up to you.
[01:41:17.845 --> 01:41:20.886]  But don't expect the rest of us to say, oh well, you're... You guys are setting policy in there, Mr. Gergen.
[01:41:20.946 --> 01:41:22.666]  I'm sorry, nobody sets policy in there.
[01:41:22.906 --> 01:41:26.347]  We try to be gentlemen, and obviously, you don't belong there.
[01:41:26.387 --> 01:41:27.588]  Weaving spiders come out here?
[01:41:29.869 --> 01:41:30.669]  Yeah!
[01:41:31.029 --> 01:41:32.890]  That is a three-pointer!
[01:41:33.310 --> 01:41:33.730]  Woo!
[01:41:34.190 --> 01:41:34.610]  What's up, man?
[01:41:34.630 --> 01:41:35.830]  How are you doing today, sir?
[01:41:36.271 --> 01:41:36.591]  Good.
[01:41:37.011 --> 01:41:37.671]  Are you a citizen?
[01:41:38.311 --> 01:41:39.211]  That's my business.
[01:41:39.871 --> 01:41:40.911]  Well, it's our business to ask.
[01:41:40.971 --> 01:41:42.012]  Are you a citizen or not?
[01:41:42.232 --> 01:41:42.712]  You can ask.
[01:41:42.732 --> 01:41:43.172]  That's fine.
[01:41:43.712 --> 01:41:44.852]  And you have to answer me, right?
[01:41:44.872 --> 01:41:50.173]  I'll have to detain you until you can either tell me that you're a citizen... Well, I don't have to answer you because I have rights as an American.
[01:41:50.213 --> 01:41:53.734]  Sir, go ahead and pull over there behind that other vehicle if you'd do me a favor.
[01:41:54.154 --> 01:41:56.795]  No thanks.
[01:41:56.855 --> 01:41:58.095]  I'd like to just go on my way.
[01:41:59.173 --> 01:42:01.714]  You can go anyway, as soon as you tell me if you're a citizen.
[01:42:02.114 --> 01:42:06.216]  Well, you know, I didn't know that I have to go around proving that I'm a citizen.
[01:42:06.236 --> 01:42:09.557]  Do I need to, like, show my papers, like the Nazis, or...?
[01:42:10.038 --> 01:42:12.799]  I'm not... Am I immigrating somewhere, or...?
[01:42:12.939 --> 01:42:16.420]  Is this Mexico, or...?
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:20.582]  Well, let me ask you this, you know, is this Nazi Germany now, if I have to show my papers?
[01:42:26.644 --> 01:42:27.745]  Get out of the vehicle.
[01:42:33.673 --> 01:42:34.754]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[01:42:34.774 --> 01:42:35.875]  Go back inside right now!
[01:42:36.035 --> 01:42:36.775]  I am inside.
[01:42:37.156 --> 01:42:37.916]  This is my door.
[01:42:37.956 --> 01:42:39.377]  I'm standing right inside my apartment.
[01:42:40.818 --> 01:42:44.100]  Sir, I'm inside my apartment.
[01:42:44.121 --> 01:42:55.849]  The First Lady of the United States recently addressed concerns about internet during a cyberspatial Millennium Project press conference just weeks after Lewinsky broke.
[01:42:59.454 --> 01:43:03.438]  She said, we're all going to have to rethink how we deal with the Internet.
[01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:13.109]  As exciting as these new developments are, there are a number of serious issues without any kind of editing function or gatekeeping function.
[01:43:14.230 --> 01:43:15.792]  I wonder who she was referring to.
[01:43:18.067 --> 01:43:34.112]  Mrs. Clinton continued, anytime an individual leaps so far ahead of that balance and throws a system, whatever it might be, political, economic, technological, out of balance, you got a problem.
[01:43:35.152 --> 01:43:39.854]  It can lead to all kinds of bad outcomes, which we have seen historically.
[01:43:41.095 --> 01:43:45.116]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[01:43:45.836 --> 01:43:48.277]  Would she have said the same thing about Ben Franklin?
[01:43:49.317 --> 01:43:50.257]  Or Thomas Edison?
[01:43:50.897 --> 01:43:51.737]  Or Henry Ford?
[01:43:51.777 --> 01:43:52.577]  Or Einstein?
[01:43:53.418 --> 01:43:56.998]  They all leapt so far ahead out that they shook the balance?
[01:43:59.459 --> 01:43:59.759]  No!
[01:43:59.959 --> 01:44:02.519]  I say to these people, faster, not slower.
[01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:03.780]  Create.
[01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:05.480]  Let your mind flow.
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:07.120]  Let the imagination take over.
[01:44:07.461 --> 01:44:09.521]  And if technology has finally caught up,
[01:44:10.646 --> 01:44:17.349]  With individual liberty, why would anyone who loves freedom want to rethink that?
[01:44:17.369 --> 01:44:25.713]  If you're an undersecretary at the Energy Department and you're doing an interview and you say one thing, you know, during it, you could end up being on the front page of Drudge.
[01:44:26.253 --> 01:44:35.698]  Anyone saying anything can get caught up in the spin cycle in a way that is very damaging.
[01:44:35.858 --> 01:44:39.880]  You know, it hurts what we're trying to do on a daily basis, but also is very damaging to that individual person.
[01:44:40.131 --> 01:44:41.913]  And we cannot hide our bad news stories.
[01:44:43.095 --> 01:44:48.521]  Bad news gets out one way or the other, and we must come to terms with telling the bad stories as well as the good.
[01:44:49.542 --> 01:44:55.049]  When bad things happen, the American people should hear it from us, not as a scoop on the Drudge Report.
[01:44:55.249 --> 01:44:57.471]  The editor of Civilization Magazine
[01:44:58.746 --> 01:45:04.428]  Adam Goodhart wrote a great op-ed in the New York Times talking about, is this really something new?
[01:45:05.408 --> 01:45:12.030]  This type of fast reporting, this competitive, I'm very competitive, I'm part of the headline generation.
[01:45:14.470 --> 01:45:27.254]  He maintains it was a going back to our foundations, when the press was found in quite a different atmosphere, when the press would report that the president's mother was a common prostitute brought over by the British Army.
[01:45:30.196 --> 01:45:31.597]  Imagine if someone did that now.
[01:45:33.878 --> 01:45:38.741]  We have a great tradition of freedom of the press in this country.
[01:45:39.021 --> 01:45:40.142]  Unpopular press.
[01:45:41.103 --> 01:45:49.368]  If the First Lady is concerned about this internet cycle, what would she have done during the heyday when there was 12, 13 editions of a paper in one day?
[01:45:50.268 --> 01:45:51.991]  What would she have done with that news cycle?
[01:45:52.732 --> 01:45:53.773]  That's the foundation.
[01:45:53.813 --> 01:45:56.657]  That's what makes this club great, is the tradition.
[01:45:57.278 --> 01:46:01.484]  And I think we have a tradition of provocative press.
[01:46:02.045 --> 01:46:05.449]  And that I maintain that I'm the new face on that.
[01:46:05.910 --> 01:46:07.031]  I'll take that for a season.
[01:46:07.532 --> 01:46:09.493]  But a lot of the stuff I do is serious stuff.
[01:46:09.593 --> 01:46:14.617]  I was first to report that the encryption was missing from a Laurel satellite, for example, a couple weeks ago.
[01:46:15.517 --> 01:46:17.459]  I didn't see the main press reporting that one.
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:21.181]  So not everything I do is gossip or bedroom.
[01:46:21.442 --> 01:46:27.406]  To the contrary, I think that's just an easy label to dismiss me and to dismiss the new medium.
[01:46:27.926 --> 01:46:36.252]  But I'm excited about the launch of this Internet medium, and again, the freedom of the press belongs to anyone who owns one.
[01:46:38.946 --> 01:46:49.531]  Tonight, the Drudge Report and InfoWars are once again in the crosshairs as the US government seeks to regulate conservative media via election laws.
[01:46:49.872 --> 01:47:01.337]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist whose stories often make their way from his website InfoWars, where on any day you can find headlines about vaccines, mass fluoridation, and the 9-11 cover-up.
[01:47:02.578 --> 01:47:05.360]  Into the so-called mainstream GOP establishment.
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:09.283]  Alex Jones was a champion of Clive and Bundy from the very beginning.
[01:47:09.523 --> 01:47:16.427]  Because he's saying he'll do whatever he has to to not be, you know, have his grazing rights stolen by these pirates.
[01:47:16.708 --> 01:47:20.830]  Drudge elevated the story and it made its way onto Fox News' airwaves.
[01:47:21.411 --> 01:47:26.554]  Next thing you know, so-called mainstream Republicans are calling people like this patriots.
[01:47:27.094 --> 01:47:32.258]  The conservative website that's called the Drudge Report pulled out all the stops today to promote a big
[01:47:32.558 --> 01:47:34.760]  New bombshell video!
[01:47:34.820 --> 01:47:38.103]  Today, the leading conservative website's headline was this.
[01:47:38.643 --> 01:47:41.946]  Civil War sent it to go for handguns.
[01:47:42.126 --> 01:47:42.767]  I'm an addict.
[01:47:43.027 --> 01:47:43.808]  I'm a drudge addict.
[01:47:44.128 --> 01:47:52.855]  My homepage is actually something else, National Review, but I find myself going to drudge all the time because as a communications professional, you can tell what's going to come down the pike.
[01:47:52.936 --> 01:47:57.720]  If there's a siren on Drudge Report, you're like, oh boy, better go knock on the Oval Office door and let them know what's going to happen.
[01:47:58.380 --> 01:47:58.980]  Walkergate.
[01:47:59.140 --> 01:48:00.101]  Yes, we're calling it that.
[01:48:00.281 --> 01:48:10.564]  It's the latest Hillary conspiracy theory that set the Internet to blaze after the Drudge Report questioned whether Clinton was using a walker in this People Magazine cover photo.
[01:48:10.804 --> 01:48:18.127]  Well, Internet pioneer Matt Drudge created a firestorm over the weekend tweeting, just paid the Obamacare penalty for not getting covered.
[01:48:18.467 --> 01:48:20.087]  I'm calling it a liberty tax.
[01:48:20.167 --> 01:48:24.949]  But a White House representative firing back tweeting, flat lie, no fee for previous years.
[01:48:24.989 --> 01:48:26.610]  Scary how much influence he once had.
[01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:27.910]  And then the White House shot back
[01:48:27.930 --> 01:48:29.411]  People had suggested I start a mailing list.
[01:48:29.451 --> 01:48:32.693]  So I collected the emails and set up a list called the Drudge Report.
[01:48:32.713 --> 01:48:33.954]  One reader turned into five.
[01:48:33.974 --> 01:48:35.115]  Then turned into a hundred.
[01:48:57.910 --> 01:49:01.533]  And faster than you could say, I never had sex with that woman, it was a thousand!
[01:49:02.453 --> 01:49:03.234]  Five thousand!
[01:49:03.254 --> 01:49:04.435]  A hundred thousand people!
[01:49:05.315 --> 01:49:07.997]  The ensuing website practically launched itself!
[01:49:08.958 --> 01:49:11.280]  Last month I had six million visitors.
[01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:14.122]  And I currently have a daily average.
[01:49:15.163 --> 01:49:17.844]  Larger than the weekly newsstand sales of Time Magazine.
[01:49:18.064 --> 01:49:19.285]  Check out these numbers.
[01:49:19.385 --> 01:49:28.309]  About 33 million visits in just the last 24 hours alone, almost 900 million in the last month, and get this, over 11 billion in the last year.
[01:49:28.930 --> 01:49:34.192]  Some people love him, some people hate him, and the White House may fear him because they can't control him.
[01:49:35.133 --> 01:49:37.054]  Anyone, for any reason, can launch a website.
[01:49:37.314 --> 01:49:39.395]  Little to no money, internet connection, local phone.
[01:49:39.975 --> 01:49:41.536]  The modem lets you cover the world.
[01:49:42.356 --> 01:49:48.159]  The modem lets you read what's happening if there's an earthquake in Alaska seconds after it happens.
[01:49:48.819 --> 01:49:50.039]  I think that's fun and dramatic.
[01:49:50.339 --> 01:49:50.860]  For free.
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:54.281]  By a medium that was built by taxpayer money.
[01:49:55.542 --> 01:49:57.182]  So, perfectly realized.
[01:49:57.703 --> 01:50:00.564]  And, again, let the future begin.
[01:50:01.693 --> 01:50:05.434]  Anyway you look at it, Matt Drudge is now a global icon.
[01:50:05.934 --> 01:50:07.855]  Not just here in the United States, but worldwide.
[01:50:08.235 --> 01:50:15.377]  He is an example of independent true media challenging the Goliath state-run systems.
[01:50:16.057 --> 01:50:21.819]  Matt Drudge is a visionary and a futurist, and I admire him because he's a folk hero.
[01:50:22.259 --> 01:50:34.386]  He's a grassroots person who was able to basically leverage his instinct for the pulse of the people and change the way the world sees news and information.
[01:50:34.867 --> 01:50:50.236]  And he's also had the courage to not just carry Infowars.com stories, but countless other grassroots media stories and really change the narrative towards one that is more based on reality and empowering the people and liberty.
[01:50:50.856 --> 01:50:58.063]  Matt Drudge is classic Americana, and he's a great example not just to our generation, but future generations to come.
[01:50:58.544 --> 01:51:07.613]  And when the history books are written on the Info Wars and the Media Wars of the 20th and 21st century, Matt Drudge's name will be right there at the center.
[01:51:16.328 --> 01:51:25.417]  Now that's powerful broadcast over radio, but in the next 30 minutes we'll post the video up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and I'm going to tweet it out.
[01:51:26.899 --> 01:51:38.770]  And even if you don't like Matt Drudge, you should understand, folks, that he promotes the entire political spectrum of thought, not just libertarian or conservative ideas, and so many times
[01:51:39.833 --> 01:51:46.559]  We wouldn't have beaten gun control legislation or other really bad things when the fight is just so close if Drudge wasn't there.
[01:51:47.821 --> 01:51:56.288]  Drudge has helped Infowars.com to a massive degree and caused the White House to respond to what we're doing and what we're saying.
[01:51:57.453 --> 01:52:03.417]  And overall, has fought against the police state, the surveillance grid, the cloning.
[01:52:04.138 --> 01:52:06.960]  Back when Drudge used to do a Sunday night radio show, I'd listen every time I could.
[01:52:08.221 --> 01:52:12.904]  And it was a more, you know, calm, professional version of what I do here on air.
[01:52:14.805 --> 01:52:15.446]  Back at the time.
[01:52:15.526 --> 01:52:17.227]  I've gotten a little bit more professional over the years.
[01:52:18.088 --> 01:52:22.291]  But the issue is, we need to get the people involved in media.
[01:52:22.791 --> 01:52:26.534]  I'm so dedicated to this, I've already skipped a break last hour, and I just skipped this break.
[01:52:27.418 --> 01:52:28.619]  That's how we fund the whole operation.
[01:52:28.639 --> 01:52:30.619]  It costs thousands of dollars every time I do it.
[01:52:30.659 --> 01:52:32.020]  That's how dedicated I am to this.
[01:52:33.060 --> 01:52:35.381]  Is that I just can't stop working.
[01:52:35.782 --> 01:52:36.822]  I can't stop thinking.
[01:52:36.982 --> 01:52:40.163]  I can't stop trying to figure out how to not be a slave.
[01:52:41.684 --> 01:52:47.547]  And how to expose that we knew the NSA was listening to people through their cable boxes 16, 17 years ago.
[01:52:47.667 --> 01:52:48.227]  I'm on record.
[01:52:49.551 --> 01:52:52.332]  We knew the smart meters were going in in many areas 10 years ago.
[01:52:52.932 --> 01:52:56.973]  We knew about the Urban Warfare gun confiscation plan 18 years ago.
[01:52:57.594 --> 01:53:02.435]  And the fact that we've been exposing it, and you've been exposing it, means we've held a lot of it off.
[01:53:03.176 --> 01:53:07.237]  Even though now it's starting to come to fruition, people always say,
[01:53:08.894 --> 01:53:15.458]  It's one of the simple labels to throw at us for non-thinking folks and propagandists who are targeting non-thinking people.
[01:53:16.058 --> 01:53:17.359]  Oh, where's the FEMA camp?
[01:53:17.379 --> 01:53:18.379]  Where's the New World Order?
[01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:19.560]  Where's Big Brother?
[01:53:19.640 --> 01:53:21.741]  Where's the... It's happening!
[01:53:21.781 --> 01:53:23.082]  Our government's funding Al-Qaeda.
[01:53:23.342 --> 01:53:24.783]  They're murdering Christians everywhere.
[01:53:24.803 --> 01:53:26.364]  There's total surveillance.
[01:53:26.464 --> 01:53:28.645]  Microphones being put up nationwide on street corners.
[01:53:29.226 --> 01:53:31.427]  Been going on for about 20 years, but now it's ubiquitous.
[01:53:32.107 --> 01:53:32.948]  It's going in everywhere.
[01:53:34.185 --> 01:53:45.310]  The flesh-eating bacteria, the diabetes doubling, tripling, quadrupling, the cancer rates exploding, the people's language shrinking, people obsessed with their smartphones.
[01:53:45.370 --> 01:53:46.410]  It's all happening.
[01:53:47.371 --> 01:53:51.893]  But there'll be a renaissance against all of that, and you are that renaissance.
[01:53:52.533 --> 01:53:52.853]  You!
[01:53:53.854 --> 01:54:01.497]  Believing in yourself, starting a blog, starting a blog radio show, a vlog, starting a video piece on YouTube.
[01:54:02.768 --> 01:54:10.355]  And not infighting like Cass Sunstein and the Pentagon go out with bots trying to stir you up with all the racist stuff they put up on both sides.
[01:54:10.975 --> 01:54:17.601]  But just sticking to issues, sticking to what the technocrats are doing, we are the vast majority.
[01:54:20.011 --> 01:54:24.633]  And the vast majority do want freedom and private property and do want true diversity of media.
[01:54:25.193 --> 01:54:26.214]  And I agree with Matt Drudge.
[01:54:26.914 --> 01:54:31.456]  We're going back to where every major city had up to 10 to 15 newspapers.
[01:54:31.916 --> 01:54:33.277]  Small towns would have two or three.
[01:54:35.318 --> 01:54:39.260]  Because that's how everybody got their news before radio and television got really big.
[01:54:40.484 --> 01:54:50.170]  And so you had reporters battling for the scoops, battling for the latest info, battling for the dirt, and it made us a much freer society.
[01:54:50.611 --> 01:54:57.715]  And people wanted that morning edition, and that lunch edition, and that evening edition, and that late late, or that extra extra.
[01:54:57.835 --> 01:54:59.056]  You know what extra extra means?
[01:55:00.437 --> 01:55:01.478]  It's an extra edition.
[01:55:03.356 --> 01:55:08.057]  The newspaper stands were just packed full of, just, oh my gosh, what happened here, what happened there?
[01:55:08.257 --> 01:55:13.758]  And if somebody was wrong, they'd get sued, and there'd be court cases, and there'd be fights over it.
[01:55:15.078 --> 01:55:19.059]  It was exciting, it was like the internet.
[01:55:19.079 --> 01:55:22.760]  1920s type newspapers, 1900 type newspapers.
[01:55:23.780 --> 01:55:27.181]  Places like New York City had 20 plus daily papers, or more.
[01:55:29.938 --> 01:55:33.001]  Dallas had more than eight papers.
[01:55:33.041 --> 01:55:34.983]  It was down to two when I was a kid, now one.
[01:55:35.003 --> 01:55:37.845]  The Dallas Times-Herald, the Dallas Morning News.
[01:55:38.126 --> 01:55:39.527]  My mom worked for the Dallas Morning News.
[01:55:40.708 --> 01:55:43.851]  We're going back to that, and they don't like it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:44.051 --> 01:55:45.773]  That's what conspiracy theory labels are.
[01:55:46.393 --> 01:55:50.477]  Oh, InfoWars is questioning why the plane flew that flight path.
[01:55:50.817 --> 01:55:52.379]  Yeah, he wears a tinfoil hat.
[01:55:53.854 --> 01:55:56.575]  Boston Globe said, the tinfoil hats are out.
[01:55:57.315 --> 01:56:00.736]  And weird Al Yankovic came out and said, the tinfoil hat people!
[01:56:01.736 --> 01:56:02.897]  Boy, how intellectual!
[01:56:04.177 --> 01:56:09.359]  You don't believe known liars in government, and so you got a tinfoil hat.
[01:56:10.699 --> 01:56:15.901]  Or you got Harvard studies that fluoride lowers IQ by about 10 points in children if they drink it for just a year.
[01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:18.921]  And seven-fold increase in bone cancer.
[01:56:19.421 --> 01:56:21.742]  I mean, what's their answer at the City Council?
[01:56:22.022 --> 01:56:24.964]  They call me a tinfoil head up on the dais and make fun of me.
[01:56:25.564 --> 01:56:31.807]  And the local radio stations make fun of me and go, yeah, the nutcase that thinks that, you know, Martians are putting stuff in the water.
[01:56:32.067 --> 01:56:33.267]  No, Martians aren't doing it.
[01:56:33.547 --> 01:56:34.388]  The globalists are.
[01:56:34.628 --> 01:56:43.972]  The Nazis and the Soviets put fluoride in the water and that's in two different Pulitzer Prize winning
[01:56:49.142 --> 01:56:56.104]  Literally, I mean, it's just so stunning to see how they are denying all of this.
[01:56:57.885 --> 01:57:00.526]  And how they're saying, you just can't even ask questions.
[01:57:02.566 --> 01:57:05.767]  But we are going to ask questions, and you don't control the narrative anymore.
[01:57:07.628 --> 01:57:10.009]  And we don't believe anything you say anymore.
[01:57:10.429 --> 01:57:13.750]  And we're learning how the world really works right now, together.
[01:57:15.131 --> 01:57:15.771]  There's the headline.
[01:57:16.132 --> 01:57:20.174]  Weird Al channels Alex Jones in a conspiracy-laden Royals parody.
[01:57:20.974 --> 01:57:25.616]  Yeah, if you don't like royalty, then you're insane to put a tinfoil hat on.
[01:57:26.077 --> 01:57:34.020]  That's base propaganda like you're a moron, targeting you like you're a fool, and you see the tyranny, you see the lies, and you just go, tinfoil!
[01:57:34.741 --> 01:57:36.742]  That's your intellectual response is to say tinfoil.
[01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:40.411]  And to make fun of people that think there's fluoride in the water.
[01:57:40.431 --> 01:57:41.472]  There is fluoride in the water.
[01:57:42.192 --> 01:57:44.694]  Now before I go any further, please support this operation.
[01:57:45.015 --> 01:57:54.422]  It's also important, even if you don't want to be part of the new media, the new dominant media, the new free media, the open media, to support real media and to promote it.
[01:57:54.903 --> 01:57:56.304]  Tell people about it word of mouth.
[01:57:56.904 --> 01:58:02.706]  And to purchase products from the sponsors of our local AM and FM affiliates of InfoWars.com.
[01:58:02.926 --> 01:58:06.707]  To go to InfoWarsLife.com, we finally got in more of the silver bullet.
[01:58:06.727 --> 01:58:07.888]  Haven't had it for two and a half months.
[01:58:08.288 --> 01:58:11.509]  It will sell out very, very quickly at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:58:11.549 --> 01:58:13.729]  The best colloidal silver out there, bar none in my view.
[01:58:14.029 --> 01:58:16.850]  Done amazing things when I've been sick, when nothing else worked.
[01:58:16.990 --> 01:58:18.571]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:58:19.211 --> 01:58:22.553]  Or 888-253-3139.
[01:58:22.793 --> 01:58:24.894]  We have a special on the fluoride shield.
[01:58:24.934 --> 01:58:27.396]  It detoxifies a whole bunch of stuff and chelates.
[01:58:28.156 --> 01:58:34.440]  With the nascent iodine survival shield, 25% off both of those respectively.
[01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:36.361]  And that special is going to end soon.
[01:58:36.761 --> 01:58:39.923]  It's available at Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:58:39.943 --> 01:58:42.024]  And I want to thank you all for supporting Infowars.
[01:58:45.626 --> 01:58:50.291]  You're standing right beside us, you deserve as much credit as I do, as Matt Grudges.
[01:58:50.732 --> 01:58:53.955]  And you are just as important as the New York Times.
[01:58:54.055 --> 01:58:57.259]  In fact, you're more important because they've been caught being big giant liars.
[01:58:59.065 --> 01:59:00.946]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:59:01.287 --> 01:59:09.212]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:59:09.332 --> 01:59:16.417]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:59:16.897 --> 01:59:21.160]  I just received my Male Vitality about three days ago and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:31.683]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:59:32.103 --> 01:59:38.284]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:59:38.584 --> 01:59:40.825]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:59:40.845 --> 01:59:44.786]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and getting the day started.
[01:59:44.966 --> 01:59:46.567]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[01:59:46.927 --> 01:59:50.868]  All the products in Infowarslife.com are simply amazing.
[01:59:51.088 --> 01:59:58.051]  Visit Infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from Infowarslife.
[02:00:02.012 --> 02:00:03.973]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:04.413 --> 02:00:07.134]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:15.069 --> 02:00:19.210]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:19.891 --> 02:00:20.691]  You want answers?
[02:00:21.471 --> 02:00:22.371]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:23.031 --> 02:00:26.653]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:27.213 --> 02:00:31.314]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:35.535 --> 02:00:38.076]  I really appreciate Daniel and Ron holding so long.
[02:00:38.096 --> 02:00:41.117]  Apologize to the other folks, but we did have guests lined up.
[02:00:41.617 --> 02:00:43.698]  Ron in Colorado, a pilot.
[02:00:44.782 --> 02:00:50.007]  And flight dispatcher to give his take on that airline being sent through that war zone.
[02:00:50.387 --> 02:00:51.788]  For me, that's the big enchilada.
[02:00:51.808 --> 02:00:53.029]  What do you think, Ron?
[02:00:54.010 --> 02:00:57.614]  Well, that was the first question I was asking when it happened.
[02:00:58.514 --> 02:01:03.519]  You know, you cannot dispatch a flight through restricted airspace or a combat zone, you know.
[02:01:03.959 --> 02:01:07.522]  That'd be the equivalency of dispatching a 747, a TWA 747 over Hanoi.
[02:01:07.542 --> 02:01:08.803]  I mean, you gotta be kidding me.
[02:01:12.066 --> 02:01:12.506]  I agree, but...
[02:01:40.094 --> 02:01:45.215]  It doesn't matter that you're a pilot and work as an air traffic controller or dispatcher.
[02:01:45.776 --> 02:01:48.596]  The Boston Globe says you're not allowed to question things like that.
[02:01:49.637 --> 02:01:55.738]  Well, what I really want to find out is, OK, every aircraft has multiple serial numbers stamped all over.
[02:01:55.798 --> 02:01:58.839]  I had part of my power plant license, too, when I was a lot younger.
[02:01:59.339 --> 02:02:04.281]  And I know every engine part is stamped with the serial number of the aircraft.
[02:02:04.621 --> 02:02:08.582]  So I want to know the serial numbers of the aircraft that's missing and match them to this aircraft.
[02:02:09.122 --> 02:02:16.045]  I just find it totally unbelievable that you've got a plane that disappears into nowhere, which is unbelievable already.
[02:02:16.505 --> 02:02:16.825]  Okay?
[02:02:16.865 --> 02:02:20.367]  That's just... I never bought that story to begin with.
[02:02:20.727 --> 02:02:23.949]  And then you have the same model type of aircraft that gets shot down over here.
[02:02:25.309 --> 02:02:27.870]  It's utterly... This story is completely and utterly ridiculous.
[02:02:27.890 --> 02:02:31.472]  Well, when you look at Operation... I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:02:32.335 --> 02:02:38.196]  I said now we're going to start declaring a Cold War by these thieves.
[02:02:38.596 --> 02:02:41.377]  I'm third generation military, Alex.
[02:02:41.457 --> 02:02:43.117]  I just don't even know what to think of this country anymore.
[02:02:43.558 --> 02:02:51.839]  You know, my father fought in World War II Korea and Vietnam against so-called communism, while you've got Harry Reid cutting land deals with the Chinese.
[02:02:51.859 --> 02:02:55.380]  You've got Smithfields selling all our chicken poultry to the Chinese.
[02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:56.721]  I mean, what is going on around here?
[02:02:56.821 --> 02:02:58.421]  I mean, I'm in a twilight zone.
[02:02:58.641 --> 02:02:59.562]  It's a total sellout.
[02:02:59.622 --> 02:03:02.484]  This is what tyranny looks like and they're just getting started.
[02:03:02.504 --> 02:03:03.064]  I hear you, brother.
[02:03:03.765 --> 02:03:04.765]  And thanks for the call.
[02:03:05.165 --> 02:03:17.314]  Remember, Operation Northwoods, ABC News, CIA would have operatives get on a plane, go land it, say it disappeared, basically, have another one take off and then get blown up later.
[02:03:18.635 --> 02:03:22.377]  They even talked about, in another false flag, how to put dead bodies on board a ship.
[02:03:22.397 --> 02:03:23.017]  They were going to do that.
[02:03:23.478 --> 02:03:24.679]  They did that in World War II, too.
[02:03:24.739 --> 02:03:26.420]  I'm telling you, folks, this is really suspicious.
[02:03:27.938 --> 02:03:29.679]  And Malaysia is working with the globalists.
[02:03:29.759 --> 02:03:30.760]  I mean, I agree.
[02:03:30.780 --> 02:03:31.501]  I mean, it looks bad.
[02:03:31.601 --> 02:03:32.621]  I don't know what's going on.
[02:03:33.202 --> 02:03:37.005]  I just know the official story is full of holes that you could drive a Mack truck through.
[02:03:37.365 --> 02:03:39.226]  Daniel, thanks for calling and holding.
[02:03:39.666 --> 02:03:40.927]  You work with aviation equipment.
[02:03:40.967 --> 02:03:41.808]  What's your take on this?
[02:03:43.029 --> 02:03:43.489]  Sure do.
[02:03:43.789 --> 02:03:44.670]  And thanks for having me.
[02:03:44.710 --> 02:03:45.531]  First time caller.
[02:03:45.691 --> 02:03:46.071]  Go ahead.
[02:03:47.452 --> 02:03:54.537]  Well, read an article out of the London Telegraph about the Dutch cyclist that was meant to be on both of the planes.
[02:03:55.578 --> 02:03:56.979]  I thought that seemed pretty unreal.
[02:03:58.108 --> 02:04:09.191]  But what your caller touched on, the last caller, you know, the probability of both of these things happening, you know, I kind of wanted to break it down really simple for your listeners.
[02:04:10.491 --> 02:04:24.214]  Even if it was a, you know, a 1% chance that the first plane went and disappeared and never was to be found again, you know, the second plane disappearing is probably another 1% or smaller chance.
[02:04:25.936 --> 02:04:28.818]  Well, you know when you multiply 1% by 1%, you get .01%.
[02:04:29.058 --> 02:04:31.920]  That's a pretty low probability.
[02:04:35.162 --> 02:04:46.250]  Yeah, it sounds like they've got a deal with Malaysian Airlines to troll over war zones, because they're now flying over the rebel-held area in Syria that's a no-fly area.
[02:04:46.270 --> 02:04:50.273]  And, I mean, that's a story out today.
[02:04:50.293 --> 02:04:51.514]  Something's going on here.
[02:04:52.429 --> 02:04:53.249]  Something's going on.
[02:04:53.890 --> 02:04:57.111]  And I guess they say, oh, look, Syria shot down a Malaysian airliner.
[02:04:57.131 --> 02:04:58.212]  We have to attack them, too.
[02:04:58.812 --> 02:05:00.493]  I mean, this is classic war propaganda.
[02:05:00.533 --> 02:05:01.853]  Thank you so much, Daniel, for holding.
[02:05:02.454 --> 02:05:06.195]  Okay, Syrian girl will give us her take on this and more.
[02:05:07.016 --> 02:05:07.436]  Stay with us.
[02:05:09.182 --> 02:05:12.905]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[02:05:13.005 --> 02:05:14.146]  I didn't, I taste dirt in it.
[02:05:14.246 --> 02:05:15.327]  God knows what's in this.
[02:05:15.568 --> 02:05:19.671]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[02:05:19.811 --> 02:05:25.616]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[02:05:25.736 --> 02:05:26.737]  That one is better.
[02:05:26.797 --> 02:05:27.758]  Tastes like nothing.
[02:05:28.038 --> 02:05:29.439]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[02:05:29.500 --> 02:05:29.980]  It's good water.
[02:05:30.100 --> 02:05:35.844]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[02:05:36.064 --> 02:05:43.129]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lower IQ, and even cancer.
[02:05:43.309 --> 02:05:45.830]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[02:05:46.031 --> 02:05:53.956]  The ProPureÂ® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[02:05:54.096 --> 02:05:55.096]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[02:05:55.237 --> 02:05:56.117]  It's good water.
[02:05:56.317 --> 02:05:56.758]  Refreshing?
[02:05:56.778 --> 02:05:57.178]  It's good!
[02:05:57.518 --> 02:06:01.962]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[02:06:01.982 --> 02:06:04.785]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[02:06:05.005 --> 02:06:06.827]  She's just not the woman I married.
[02:06:06.847 --> 02:06:07.948]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[02:06:21.520 --> 02:06:22.961]  Does this seem familiar?
[02:06:23.161 --> 02:06:26.204]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[02:06:26.504 --> 02:06:27.825]  If so, consider this.
[02:06:28.086 --> 02:06:36.993]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[02:06:37.373 --> 02:06:43.376]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.
[02:06:43.756 --> 02:06:45.376]  Forget synthetic chemicals.
[02:06:45.797 --> 02:06:53.440]  Super Female Vitality brings forward key herbs specifically chosen for women's biology without the use of phony additives.

[02:07:01.664 --> 02:07:02.664]  Live Life Healthy!
[02:07:08.934 --> 02:07:14.883]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:07:15.103 --> 02:07:19.289]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:07:19.670 --> 02:07:24.237]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:07:24.637 --> 02:07:27.238]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:07:27.558 --> 02:07:32.740]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:07:33.001 --> 02:07:39.883]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:07:40.384 --> 02:07:44.145]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:07:44.525 --> 02:07:49.307]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:49.628 --> 02:07:50.488]  This is innovating.
[02:07:50.768 --> 02:07:58.053]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:07:58.253 --> 02:08:02.316]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[02:08:22.745 --> 02:08:24.206]  We are on the march.
[02:08:24.546 --> 02:08:26.947]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:08:27.708 --> 02:08:31.470]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:34.892 --> 02:08:40.335]  Mimi Al-Ahem, or Syrian Girl, is with us for the Balance of the Hour.
[02:08:40.375 --> 02:08:41.455]  At the bottom of the hour.
[02:08:41.475 --> 02:08:43.176]  I'm going to put the phones up so you can talk to her.
[02:08:44.977 --> 02:08:47.598]  She is in Australia.
[02:08:48.499 --> 02:08:51.020]  Her family are refugees from Syria.
[02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:51.941]  We're anti-Assad.
[02:08:53.277 --> 02:09:11.068]  And for about a year and a half now, first going on YouTube and this show and then on Australian television, RT, you name it, Syrian Girl has been one of the most accurate reporters out there and pundits exposing what's happening in Syria.
[02:09:11.128 --> 02:09:11.829]  Now ISIS
[02:09:13.174 --> 02:09:15.577]  Has gone into Iraq, killing tens of thousands there.
[02:09:15.618 --> 02:09:23.669]  They estimate 300,000 dead in the last three and a half, almost four years of globalist backed destabilization, civil war operations in Syria.
[02:09:24.330 --> 02:09:27.855]  And again, I don't endorse Vladimir Putin.
[02:09:27.915 --> 02:09:29.016]  Russia's got a lot of issues.
[02:09:31.112 --> 02:09:35.677]  Alexander Sholzhenitsyn, who I admire, did endorse him before he died, publicly, and the U.S.
[02:09:35.717 --> 02:09:39.520]  Ambassador went there, not believing it, and had dinner with him.
[02:09:39.901 --> 02:09:52.613]  He said a cogent, Sholzhenitsyn broke it all down, that compared to the wicked West, that was run by such evil, and that it actually funded the Bolsheviks to begin with, Sholzhenitsyn wrote a book about it, that literally I could have written, but not as good as him.
[02:09:53.914 --> 02:09:57.235]  About how the West overthrew Russia, put the Bolsheviks in.
[02:09:57.756 --> 02:10:03.038]  And that information has been so powerful in Russia, that it's deprogramming the KGB people, all of them.
[02:10:04.719 --> 02:10:19.025]  And it's a nationalism, and I guess a patriarchy, you could call it, being set up there, which I have some problems with, kind of an El Jefe system, but compared to exterminism and the destruction of Russia, it's certainly better than communism.
[02:10:20.063 --> 02:10:22.725]  The issue is Russia is not offensively attacking anybody.
[02:10:23.145 --> 02:10:24.606]  They're in a proxy war in Syria.
[02:10:25.627 --> 02:10:27.028]  They're in a proxy war in Iraq.
[02:10:27.728 --> 02:10:43.239]  The government that our government put in, Maliki, has been neutral and is basically being overthrown right now by Saudi Arabia and the ISIS forces, and that's all come out now.
[02:10:44.119 --> 02:10:46.881]  So there's some of the background on that front, but we'll take your calls.
[02:10:46.901 --> 02:10:47.962]  The phones are wide open now.
[02:10:49.670 --> 02:11:01.741]  With your questions or comments on the geopolitical things in Ukraine, in Syria, in Iraq, and in other areas of Africa where the ISIS and Al-Qaeda forces are publicly funded by globalist interest.
[02:11:02.382 --> 02:11:04.043]  And then our military goes and fights them.
[02:11:04.083 --> 02:11:06.485]  You have to understand, this is full spectrum dominance.
[02:11:06.525 --> 02:11:12.331]  You want to destabilize the country, then the military has to march in and deal with them after they've taken the nation down later.
[02:11:13.550 --> 02:11:14.391]  So I'm going to explain.
[02:11:14.471 --> 02:11:16.012]  They're real Al-Qaeda, real ISIS.
[02:11:16.633 --> 02:11:18.114]  And they're not controlled by the West.
[02:11:18.195 --> 02:11:23.079]  They are... It's like turning a vicious, rabid pit bull loose with small children.
[02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:25.802]  You know, the pit bull's not under your control.
[02:11:25.882 --> 02:11:27.864]  You just release it in to attack.
[02:11:28.845 --> 02:11:30.206]  And that's what's going on here.
[02:11:31.047 --> 02:11:33.149]  And the CFR writes about it every month.
[02:11:33.229 --> 02:11:35.291]  They don't even... I remember the headline two years ago.
[02:11:35.672 --> 02:11:38.034]  Why we need Al-Qaeda in Syria and how great they are.
[02:11:40.404 --> 02:11:44.687]  And then finally, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz came out and said we're not Al-Qaeda's air force in Syria.
[02:11:45.087 --> 02:11:51.451]  And the military, holding up Infowars.com signs, that's where it started, with hashtags said, I will not fight for Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[02:11:52.152 --> 02:11:59.437]  And the chairman of the Joint Chiefs went on the Friday night before the strike was set and said, you have to stand down, we can't do this.
[02:12:00.512 --> 02:12:08.063]  And then it came out the British SAS and others did train, as we told you two years ago, Al Qaeda forces and ISIS forces.
[02:12:08.664 --> 02:12:12.650]  They know you know it's Al Qaeda, so they just change it to ISIS, folks, to confuse you.
[02:12:14.577 --> 02:12:20.461]  And now they've had a bunch of the Wahhabists even come out in Saudi Arabia and say these people are being run by the West.
[02:12:20.821 --> 02:12:24.984]  So that's now in major Riyadh newspapers, it's in Israeli papers.
[02:12:25.364 --> 02:12:30.287]  And then Netanyahu came out a month ago and said, we need ISIS, you know, they're doing a good job.
[02:12:31.448 --> 02:12:39.774]  Because it got exposed that in northern Israel by Lebanon, and then bordering Syria, that Israeli forces are coordinating with ISIS.
[02:12:42.813 --> 02:12:45.054]  And people then send me emails saying, why are you anti-Israel?
[02:12:45.074 --> 02:12:55.457]  Man, you're mentally ill if you think that I'm going to sign on to backing Al Qaeda blowing up churches, or blowing up moderate Muslims, and putting burqas on women's heads, okay?
[02:12:56.698 --> 02:12:58.378]  And sexually mutilating people, okay?
[02:12:59.559 --> 02:13:00.559]  I'm not anti-Israel.
[02:13:01.399 --> 02:13:06.441]  But our country, Israel, all of them, the decisions have been made to back Al Qaeda worldwide.
[02:13:07.844 --> 02:13:09.105]  And that's incredibly immoral.
[02:13:09.526 --> 02:13:13.710]  And what does it say about us if we just let them ignore this and let this keep going on?
[02:13:13.770 --> 02:13:14.871]  Our military's not ignoring it.
[02:13:15.011 --> 02:13:15.672]  They're freaked out.
[02:13:15.912 --> 02:13:16.533]  And they should be.
[02:13:17.994 --> 02:13:20.997]  Terrorism has been used to end our way of life and bring in tyranny.
[02:13:21.558 --> 02:13:23.159]  And now they say the Tea Party's the main enemy.
[02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:26.282]  And gun owners and returning veterans and Christians.
[02:13:26.663 --> 02:13:27.343]  That's on record.
[02:13:28.725 --> 02:13:29.505]  Don't you see it?
[02:13:29.565 --> 02:13:30.607]  The border's wide open.
[02:13:30.847 --> 02:13:31.808]  It's all a fraud.
[02:13:34.286 --> 02:13:37.748]  We are now the enemy because the globalists are literally occupiers.
[02:13:38.388 --> 02:13:40.149]  We get that message out, we can stop them.
[02:13:41.390 --> 02:13:49.554]  So we salute Syrian girl, twitter.com forward slash partisan girl, youtube.com Syrian girl partisan, and she joins us.
[02:13:49.594 --> 02:13:52.656]  So Mimi, great to have you on with us from Australia.
[02:13:52.916 --> 02:13:55.257]  Thanks for getting up at four in the morning or whatever it is.
[02:13:55.737 --> 02:13:56.998]  What time is it in Australia?
[02:13:57.972 --> 02:14:00.956]  At the moment it's about getting towards 3 a.m.
[02:14:01.016 --> 02:14:01.437]  I think.
[02:14:02.378 --> 02:14:04.100]  And thanks so much for having me on again.
[02:14:04.961 --> 02:14:06.884]  It's a great pleasure and an honor to be on.
[02:14:06.964 --> 02:14:07.725]  It's an honor to have you.
[02:14:08.065 --> 02:14:11.410]  Okay, well you've heard me for five minutes talking about my view.
[02:14:11.450 --> 02:14:12.010]  What's your take?
[02:14:12.031 --> 02:14:13.553]  Where do you want to start in the world?
[02:14:14.875 --> 02:14:27.538]  Well, I would love to go straight into ISIS if that's okay and then we can get on to the other things because I just want to basically support and reiterate a lot of what you've just said.
[02:14:28.539 --> 02:14:33.000]  Just recently ISIS has actually pushed out all of the Christians
[02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:48.750]  from Mosul in Iraq, which they've been there for two thousands of years, and they've actually been marking their homes just like the Nazis would have marked the homes of Jewish people in Germany just before and during World War II.
[02:14:49.611 --> 02:15:01.416]  So they've been, of course, destroying Iraq's historical artifacts and following on the trend of the destruction of Iraq's history since the start of the war in 2003.
[02:15:01.476 --> 02:15:09.759]  They've been stoning women and basically their goal is to turn back time to 1,400 years ago.
[02:15:10.540 --> 02:15:15.122]  So a British person of Pakistani descent
[02:15:16.522 --> 02:15:24.684]  Living, who is born in Britain and lived there all his life because he happens to be of this specific sect of Wahhabi Islam.
[02:15:25.624 --> 02:15:34.466]  He believes himself more entitled to Syrian land than a Syrian Christian or a Syrian Muslim that's been living there for his entire life.
[02:15:35.327 --> 02:15:40.708]  So they believe that anything that is Muslim land that has a majority of Muslims living in it
[02:15:41.505 --> 02:16:04.544]  No matter if those Muslims agree with their brand of Wahhabism or not, Wahhabism is a specific cult that Al-Qaeda follow, they believe that land automatically belongs to them and they're allowed to just go in there, steal people's homes, steal people's oil, slaughter people, not give anything to society but just create war and destruction and it's basically like a zombie horde.
[02:16:05.965 --> 02:16:13.129]  I'd love to talk about who is backing them and basically how the media plays a role in all this as well.
[02:16:13.830 --> 02:16:17.232]  Sure, I mean they're acting, playing dumb like we don't know where ISIS came from.
[02:16:17.252 --> 02:16:20.614]  Well, it came from the bases they've set up there in eastern...
[02:16:21.696 --> 02:16:35.016]  Syria the last couple years and they've been given all these weapons and that's what they're there for but yeah Let's let's talk about some of these people who are blowing up churches lining up Christians and non-radical Muslims including
[02:16:36.385 --> 02:16:36.826]  Sunnis.
[02:16:37.206 --> 02:16:43.133]  Again, Wahhabism, for folks that don't know, is a tiny minority of the majority of Islam, I guess about 80%, that are Sunnis.
[02:16:44.054 --> 02:16:46.037]  And of course, you're a Sunni as well.
[02:16:46.918 --> 02:16:53.325]  And it's just amazing that they're now even killing other Sunnis they don't like, and eating hearts, and just...
[02:16:53.846 --> 02:16:55.629]  And I've talked to a lot of military people and family.
[02:16:55.649 --> 02:16:58.152]  They just say Wahhabists are like crazed demons.
[02:16:58.513 --> 02:16:59.434]  They're not Muslims.
[02:16:59.454 --> 02:17:03.200]  I mean, they rape women, rape men, kill babies.
[02:17:03.260 --> 02:17:06.345]  They just are a bunch of psycho supremacists, like you said.
[02:17:06.385 --> 02:17:07.126]  They think they're God.
[02:17:08.803 --> 02:17:10.104]  Well, exactly.
[02:17:10.144 --> 02:17:21.990]  They really believe that they are backed by God and the media has been sort of helping in this because they're giving them an air of invincibility and they're sort of muddying the waters about where their support is coming from.
[02:17:22.010 --> 02:17:24.991]  They're making them appear as though nobody's supporting them.
[02:17:25.292 --> 02:17:33.356]  So some brainwashed youth in the West will start to think, oh, maybe God is the one who is making ISIS so strong, you know, perhaps
[02:17:34.016 --> 02:17:37.379]  You know, they start to believe in this myth that's being created.
[02:17:37.879 --> 02:17:44.764]  And, you know, ISIS, in fact, formed in Iraq in 2006, around 2006-2007.
[02:17:45.464 --> 02:17:51.189]  And one of its leaders actually admitted when he was captured that the group solely existed on the Internet.
[02:17:51.869 --> 02:17:56.231]  And yet, even while this is happening, it was given so much attention by Al Jazeera.
[02:17:57.472 --> 02:18:03.635]  The thing is, Al Qaeda was never in Iraq in 2003, even though Bush was claiming it was.
[02:18:04.115 --> 02:18:07.017]  It came to Iraq much later, as I said, in 2006.
[02:18:07.797 --> 02:18:14.941]  So, it just goes to show you that if Syria and Iraq, the countries, were not destabilized, these groups would never have
[02:18:15.941 --> 02:18:18.582]  been formed, have grown as they have.
[02:18:18.602 --> 02:18:22.604]  They used to be largely a myth and now they've become a reality.
[02:18:22.624 --> 02:18:43.712]  I think the purpose of ISIS in Iraq was mainly to create a division between Shiites and Sunnis because in 2004, if you recall, many people were protesting against the occupation that were both Sunni and Shiite and the country was sort of united against the occupation and
[02:18:45.393 --> 02:19:04.745]  In order to divide and conquer them, of course, the thinkers of the time, such as James Steele, Robert Ford, who created the El Salvador Option, I'm forgetting a lot of names here, they decided to back death squads from both the Shia side and the Sunni side.
[02:19:05.085 --> 02:19:14.611]  So on the Shia side of the coin, they supported the Beta Brigades, which were supported by Iran and created by Iran during the Iran-Iraq War.
[02:19:15.191 --> 02:19:23.679]  And they actually put them into the interior ministry of Iraq and created this very sectarian government and military.
[02:19:23.739 --> 02:19:33.768]  And on the other side of that coin, they created ISIS, which of course sees all Shiites as basically lambs to the slaughter.
[02:19:33.948 --> 02:19:40.735]  Just like Israel created Hamas to counter Hezbollah in 1974 or 5, this is full spectrum dominance.
[02:19:41.806 --> 02:19:48.529]  For those that don't understand, where you create the two groups to wreck the country, the target is the women and children.
[02:19:48.929 --> 02:19:50.350]  The target is civilization.
[02:19:50.730 --> 02:19:52.131]  The target is movie theaters.
[02:19:52.431 --> 02:19:53.652]  The target is running water.
[02:19:54.112 --> 02:19:56.593]  The target is eugenics.
[02:19:57.514 --> 02:19:58.654]  And that's what this is.
[02:19:59.054 --> 02:20:04.017]  And that's why these are absolutely war crimes by the Rand Corporation and the Pentagon.
[02:20:04.637 --> 02:20:06.178]  And they're doing it to us here domestically.
[02:20:06.218 --> 02:20:08.659]  We're all under attack too here in America.

[02:25:24.233 --> 02:25:25.813]  I mean, this is so evil.
[02:25:25.873 --> 02:25:27.754]  It's chaos, just like they want our borders open.
[02:25:28.094 --> 02:25:30.254]  Just like they want to teach kids 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[02:25:31.114 --> 02:25:33.415]  And cut our power plants off and ship our jobs overseas.
[02:25:33.735 --> 02:25:35.435]  This country is under attack.
[02:25:35.775 --> 02:25:37.335]  The whole world is by the globalists.
[02:25:37.875 --> 02:25:39.036]  They're attacking everybody.
[02:25:39.336 --> 02:25:42.116]  They're cutting our troops off of their VA benefits.
[02:25:42.536 --> 02:25:43.536]  Putting them on death list.
[02:25:44.677 --> 02:25:49.017]  Syrian girl joins us again with her inside perspective.
[02:25:50.077 --> 02:25:52.338]  Mimi, continuing here with where you left off.
[02:25:53.560 --> 02:25:58.845]  How are things going from your family you talked to back in Syria in the war?
[02:25:58.865 --> 02:26:07.293]  I know they've been forced to do a lot of setbacks and militarily if you're losing one conflict to boost morale and keep momentum going a lot of times you'll then try to invade something else.
[02:26:07.633 --> 02:26:10.776]  I think that's a big part of this move into Iraq as well.
[02:26:11.116 --> 02:26:14.419]  Saudi Arabia has been trying to act like they're not involved but they're involved on record.
[02:26:14.700 --> 02:26:15.801]  So what's your intel on that?
[02:26:17.182 --> 02:26:25.444]  Well, from what's left of my family in Syria, they're residing in Damascus and they actually told me that the situation in Damascus is getting much better.
[02:26:25.804 --> 02:26:32.245]  The checkpoints are no longer very close to the city, they're moving out into the outskirts.
[02:26:32.665 --> 02:26:42.367]  But on the other hand, in Aleppo, I have a friend in Aleppo and he tells me that in that city of two million people, they've been without running water for two months.
[02:26:42.867 --> 02:26:47.692]  Because the Al-Qaeda rebels actually blew up the water supply.
[02:26:47.733 --> 02:26:50.215]  And this isn't ISIS, this is Jabhat al-Nusra.
[02:26:50.496 --> 02:27:00.267]  The other Al-Qaeda rebels, the moderate rebels that they keep telling us about, seem to be working alongside, and so they're just conveniently forgotten about in the media.
[02:27:01.047 --> 02:27:02.909]  So yeah, they've actually been without
[02:27:03.877 --> 02:27:10.941]  running water, they can't take showers, they can't flush the toilet, they can't make a cup of tea or anything.
[02:27:11.401 --> 02:27:18.885]  So they've been taking it out of rivers and just dragging them back to their homes.
[02:27:18.925 --> 02:27:21.306]  And you never hear about that from the humanitarians.
[02:27:21.907 --> 02:27:28.530]  But I just wanted to go back to Hamas just for a little bit because of what's going on in Gaza and what you mentioned about its creation.
[02:27:28.550 --> 02:27:32.853]  I just wanted to say yes, they were created to weaken
[02:27:33.613 --> 02:27:38.137]  Other groups which were based on nationalism and secularism rather than religion.
[02:27:38.537 --> 02:27:41.520]  But perhaps maybe Hamas just wasn't sectarian enough.
[02:27:41.940 --> 02:27:48.506]  Because in 2001, the Mossad actually was caught trying to start an Al Qaeda cell in Gaza.
[02:27:48.546 --> 02:27:49.687]  So that's really interesting.
[02:27:49.787 --> 02:27:57.094]  And it's also interesting that it was ISIS that claimed to have captured the three illegal Israeli settlers.
[02:27:57.634 --> 02:27:58.275]  Not Hamas.
[02:27:58.295 --> 02:28:00.156]  Hamas actually said they had nothing to do with it.
[02:28:00.516 --> 02:28:05.319]  And that was the event that was the precursor to Israel starting to bomb Gaza.
[02:28:05.880 --> 02:28:10.723]  So it's interesting how ISIS has been tying in to that plan.
[02:28:10.783 --> 02:28:20.470]  And one of the other plans that ISIS has really been tying into is the balkanization of Iraq and Syria into each country being split into three separate states.
[02:28:21.050 --> 02:28:32.404]  Which has been one of the main goals of a lot of these think tanks, such as the Brookings Institute, that suggested this would be really beneficial towards the US and Israel.
[02:28:32.804 --> 02:28:38.231]  And of course, you know, that means the creation of Kurdistan, supporting the Peshmerga there.
[02:28:38.811 --> 02:28:39.813]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[02:28:41.136 --> 02:28:48.103]  At Harvard, the Chicago Business School, the Pentagon, Rand Corporation, all these big think tanks are bragging about how great this is going.
[02:28:49.644 --> 02:28:58.252]  I wonder how everybody in Israel deals with Netanyahu openly endorsing ISIS a month ago and saying, you know, what's going on in Iraq is good for us.
[02:28:59.132 --> 02:28:59.893]  Good for us!
[02:29:00.153 --> 02:29:04.978]  I mean, how is joining with evil, causing civil war, killing innocent people,
[02:29:06.561 --> 02:29:08.064]  How is that good for Israel?
[02:29:08.825 --> 02:29:15.899]  I mean, I can see the geopolitical things for now, but how is losing the moral high ground, how is doing that good for Israel?
[02:29:17.403 --> 02:29:20.644]  Well, they just want more land, I guess it's like.
[02:29:20.744 --> 02:29:26.285]  Or they just want to continue their ethnic cleansing of all of the Palestinians that live amongst them.
[02:29:26.865 --> 02:29:28.945]  So that's the agenda.
[02:29:29.205 --> 02:29:30.866]  I don't think it's good for Jewish people.
[02:29:31.326 --> 02:29:36.567]  I think that it's good for only the state that wants to grow.
[02:29:36.587 --> 02:29:38.147]  I mean, the state has a mind of its own.
[02:29:38.187 --> 02:29:41.608]  It doesn't care about... Exactly, that's why all these governments act just the same.
[02:29:42.929 --> 02:29:45.331]  Just like our state wants a war with Russia, but we don't.
[02:29:46.132 --> 02:29:53.038]  It's the state and people like George Soros in it that just get power out of chaos and out of a permanent crisis government.
[02:29:53.438 --> 02:29:54.279]  A COG.
[02:29:54.699 --> 02:29:58.082]  We'll be back with phone calls with Syrian girl and get her take on Ukraine.
[02:29:58.262 --> 02:29:59.142]  We're on the march.
[02:29:59.643 --> 02:30:01.224]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:01.244 --> 02:30:05.247]  That Drudge video is now on InfoWars.com.
[02:30:05.708 --> 02:30:08.210]  The Drudge video is now on InfoWars.com.
[02:30:09.793 --> 02:30:11.534]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grew.
[02:30:12.075 --> 02:30:19.059]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[02:30:19.499 --> 02:30:29.906]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[02:30:30.327 --> 02:30:39.573]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[02:30:40.293 --> 02:30:43.714]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[02:30:44.354 --> 02:30:47.814]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[02:30:48.115 --> 02:30:49.715]  Experience the new formula.
[02:30:50.175 --> 02:30:52.175]  Experience the ancient purity.
[02:30:52.755 --> 02:30:53.776]  Shield your family.
[02:30:54.096 --> 02:30:55.476]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:30:55.896 --> 02:30:58.516]  Available now at Infowarslife.com.
[02:30:59.057 --> 02:31:03.017]  X2 from Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:31:08.206 --> 02:31:15.269]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:31:15.369 --> 02:31:17.530]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:31:17.710 --> 02:31:22.813]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:31:22.993 --> 02:31:27.935]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:31:28.155 --> 02:31:31.218]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:31:31.478 --> 02:31:35.342]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:31:35.542 --> 02:31:39.786]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:31:39.887 --> 02:31:49.896]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:31:50.116 --> 02:31:52.639]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:31:52.799 --> 02:32:00.871]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:32:01.011 --> 02:32:04.996]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:32:08.231 --> 02:32:10.815]  Alex Jones here for InfoWars.com.
[02:32:11.035 --> 02:32:15.681]  In the month of July, we have got giant specials on everything at Madein1776.com.
[02:32:15.701 --> 02:32:17.704]  The already discounted Made in 1776 t-shirts are only $17.76.
[02:32:23.131 --> 02:32:27.936]  We have the new belt buckles that in only two weeks of sale are very close to selling out.
[02:32:27.956 --> 02:32:29.358]  There's only 500 of each.
[02:32:29.618 --> 02:32:33.723]  We're talking about made in America belt buckles in nickel brass.
[02:32:33.823 --> 02:32:35.885]  This is more than a summer blowout special.
[02:32:36.086 --> 02:32:38.989]  This is a new declaration of independence.
[02:32:39.189 --> 02:32:50.654]  But to expand the info orb, we're offering the equivalent of more than five months free, right now, when you get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv, for a limited time, only $39.95 a year.
[02:32:50.934 --> 02:32:54.475]  That's more than five months free, off the regular price.
[02:32:54.815 --> 02:33:01.058]  Not just this July 4th weekend, but the entire month of July, at MadeIn1776.com.
[02:33:01.438 --> 02:33:06.500]  Molon Labe, you can take my gun from my cold, dead hands.
[02:33:13.076 --> 02:33:33.886]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:43.178 --> 02:33:58.504]  We're going to be going to your phone calls here in just a few minutes after I get her take on where all this ends.
[02:33:58.744 --> 02:33:59.325]  Syrian girl.
[02:34:01.405 --> 02:34:03.606]  And her take on the whole Ukraine situation.
[02:34:03.866 --> 02:34:07.248]  It's all part of the same proxy war, but I want to get her specific take on it.
[02:34:08.650 --> 02:34:11.932]  Briefly, folks, we're not powerless here.
[02:34:12.552 --> 02:34:18.095]  We did stop the open al-Qaeda backing invasion of Syria.
[02:34:19.135 --> 02:34:20.956]  So now they've just attacked Iraq with them.
[02:34:22.617 --> 02:34:28.700]  It's just so evil and so criminal and so illegal that I don't even have words to describe it.
[02:34:28.740 --> 02:34:30.340]  And again, it's like the borders being wide open.
[02:34:30.921 --> 02:34:32.281]  The stand down was ordered four months ago.
[02:34:32.321 --> 02:34:33.702]  The Border Patrol president's on record.
[02:34:34.980 --> 02:34:37.842]  And the media still acts like they don't know why there's a problem on the border.
[02:34:38.222 --> 02:34:46.687]  It'd be like if you burned your neighbor's house down in broad daylight in front of the cops, and the cops went, we don't know who burned it down, even though there's video of you burning it down.
[02:34:48.448 --> 02:34:49.749]  This is the age of crisis.
[02:34:49.769 --> 02:34:56.633]  They're pulling out all the stops to bring in the world government on the backs of the financial collapse, and then blame the financial collapse on all the wars and stuff.
[02:34:56.873 --> 02:34:59.235]  Which I've been saying for years, because this is how they do it.
[02:34:59.755 --> 02:35:01.596]  They've done this in the third world over and over again.
[02:35:01.936 --> 02:35:02.777]  They're now doing it here.
[02:35:04.482 --> 02:35:10.426]  Please remember that this hour is brought to you by the best storable food out there, MyPatriotSupply.com, forward slash Alex.
[02:35:10.446 --> 02:35:15.169]  And I love the big plastic tote boxes, like, you know, storage boxes that it comes in.
[02:35:15.289 --> 02:35:16.210]  Super high quality.
[02:35:16.490 --> 02:35:18.091]  It's what I use for myself and my family.
[02:35:18.471 --> 02:35:19.272]  Non-GMO.
[02:35:19.592 --> 02:35:21.813]  MyPatriotSupply.com, forward slash Alex.
[02:35:22.214 --> 02:35:25.516]  In these times, you're nuts if you don't have a good supply of storable food.
[02:35:25.536 --> 02:35:25.576]  866-229-0927.
[02:35:25.916 --> 02:35:26.517]  MyPatriotSupply.
[02:35:26.537 --> 02:35:26.777]  And lastly,
[02:35:32.020 --> 02:35:33.881]  I forgot to take it this morning because I got busy.
[02:35:34.581 --> 02:35:35.502]  And boy am I feeling it.
[02:35:35.522 --> 02:35:37.843]  And I do this about three times a day.
[02:35:37.863 --> 02:35:40.525]  I take a little bit more than the recommended allowance of this.
[02:35:40.925 --> 02:35:42.866]  I take the Super Male Vitality.
[02:35:42.886 --> 02:35:45.908]  I'm putting a brand new bottle of it because I can't find the one that was here.
[02:35:47.188 --> 02:35:49.650]  And then I put a dropper.
[02:35:49.670 --> 02:35:50.670]  I'm going to do two droppers.
[02:35:50.690 --> 02:35:52.671]  I need the energy.
[02:35:54.392 --> 02:35:55.593]  Two droppers of that.
[02:35:56.923 --> 02:36:04.984]  Then I take the Survival Shield Super Nascent Iodine X2 that is life-changing for me and so many others that have taken it.
[02:36:05.625 --> 02:36:09.405]  This is why they put bad halogens in the food and water to block the good halogen.
[02:36:09.965 --> 02:36:12.846]  You put that in there, that is a hefty dose.
[02:36:12.886 --> 02:36:18.587]  Consult your physician before you take this, ladies and gentlemen, because you will detox.
[02:36:18.607 --> 02:36:25.488]  I mean, I took about half the dose the first six months or so of this stuff, and in the first month I did have some detoxing effects that I was warned about.
[02:36:26.618 --> 02:36:28.399]  And then stuff just poured out of my skin.
[02:36:28.659 --> 02:36:30.119]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[02:36:30.699 --> 02:36:32.480]  And people can notice I tan better than I used to.
[02:36:32.500 --> 02:36:33.600]  I used to just get sunspots.
[02:36:33.981 --> 02:36:38.702]  When I got out in the sun, now I actually turn brown, which is what so many experts said.
[02:36:38.742 --> 02:36:40.023]  And this is not out yet.
[02:36:40.443 --> 02:36:41.523]  No one knows what this is.
[02:36:43.104 --> 02:36:45.725]  But it'll be available soon.
[02:36:45.745 --> 02:36:47.205]  I'm taking this.
[02:36:47.985 --> 02:36:49.706]  So I'm not going to announce this product yet.
[02:36:51.215 --> 02:36:52.576]  So here you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:36:52.616 --> 02:36:53.236]  Here's to liberty.
[02:36:53.256 --> 02:36:53.836]  Here's to freedom.
[02:36:54.136 --> 02:36:55.517]  Here's to stopping World War III.
[02:36:56.017 --> 02:36:58.178]  Here's to humanity surviving in space bases.
[02:36:58.558 --> 02:37:01.139]  And here's to you, all of you out there that support the InfoWars.
[02:37:01.499 --> 02:37:03.580]  InfoWarsLife.com to get these products.
[02:37:03.600 --> 02:37:08.321]  I need a straw, because the iodine goes to the bottom.
[02:37:09.362 --> 02:37:10.062]  Or a stirrer.
[02:37:10.362 --> 02:37:11.663]  And I take it straight a lot, too.
[02:37:12.143 --> 02:37:15.844]  And we develop these iodines so they don't taste horrible, like the alcohol-based ones.
[02:37:15.864 --> 02:37:17.185]  I'm not knocking the alcohol-based ones.
[02:37:17.645 --> 02:37:19.986]  It's just that it binds up with it and tastes like rocket fuel.
[02:37:20.751 --> 02:37:22.753]  So some people are like, I'm not gonna take that, that's iodine.
[02:37:23.314 --> 02:37:27.599]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is in organic palm oil.
[02:37:30.883 --> 02:37:32.484]  So again, Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:37:32.524 --> 02:37:35.027]  Don't forget all the books, the films, the t-shirts.
[02:37:40.450 --> 02:37:45.112]  Pro Liberty Products, Made in America, Madein1776.com.
[02:37:45.552 --> 02:37:50.033]  All that's discounted the month of July at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:37:55.680 --> 02:37:55.860]  888-253-3139.
[02:37:55.880 --> 02:38:03.464]  And we will sell out soon on the limited-edition Molon Labe belt buckles.
[02:38:03.984 --> 02:38:11.609]  So again, get a great piece of Americana, promote the Second Amendment, and get a limited-edition belt buckle and support the Infowar.
[02:38:11.929 --> 02:38:18.593]  Made in 1776.com or you can find the Made in 1776 section at InfowarStore.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:38:18.633 --> 02:38:19.573]  And the whole family
[02:38:22.575 --> 02:38:24.136]  of Infowarslife.com products.
[02:38:24.156 --> 02:38:27.799]  We've been sold out for two and a half months on the Silver Bullet, Super Coil Silver.
[02:38:28.139 --> 02:38:30.461]  We have some of that back in right now as well.
[02:38:30.961 --> 02:38:42.370]  Okay, going back to Syrian Girl, Mimi, finishing up with where you see all this going and why do you think suddenly Obama doesn't care if people know that our government runs Al Qaeda?
[02:38:43.651 --> 02:38:50.276]  How can Benjamin Netanyahu say we got to attack this country or Gaza, this area, this enclave,
[02:38:51.300 --> 02:39:01.524]  Because ISIS killed three of our teenagers, but then be in the Jerusalem Post saying what ISIS is doing is good for Israel and Iraq and Iran.
[02:39:03.104 --> 02:39:08.346]  It's just such moral bankruptcy publicly, and then it's moral high ground.
[02:39:08.386 --> 02:39:11.167]  If I'm not for Al-Qaeda, I'm now anti-Israel.
[02:39:11.227 --> 02:39:12.448]  It's very bizarre.
[02:39:13.775 --> 02:39:21.561]  It's because they count on the fact that they can keep people asleep and dumbed down with all their stupid shows that they put on for them.
[02:39:21.981 --> 02:39:24.483]  And basically they muddy the waters, you know.
[02:39:25.344 --> 02:39:35.012]  On one hand, they tell you, oh, they try to spread rumors like, oh, Israel's neutral or Israel actually supports Assad, when in reality they're actually
[02:39:35.792 --> 02:39:41.855]  Helping the rebels, giving them medical aid, and giving them shelter on the border.
[02:39:41.935 --> 02:39:43.776]  And these are Al-Qaeda that they're sheltering.
[02:39:43.796 --> 02:39:51.501]  You know, it's obvious for people who are paying attention, but they're counting on the fact that nobody's paying attention.
[02:39:53.101 --> 02:39:55.503]  Other points you'd like to get out on air before we go to calls?
[02:39:55.583 --> 02:39:57.464]  And I want to get your take on Ukraine.
[02:39:59.203 --> 02:40:17.507]  Other points on ISIS, I suppose, I just wanted to really make the point that when Obama said he wanted to give $500 million to strengthen the moderate rebels, what he really was trying to say is, I want to give $500 million to ISIS.
[02:40:17.907 --> 02:40:24.788]  Because he himself said a week previously that the idea of a moderate-ready rebel force in Syria is a fantasy.
[02:40:25.308 --> 02:40:37.952]  And even the head of the moderates, Jamal Marouf, this is the guy that the US says is the beacon of hope, said on record to The Independent that Al-Qaeda is not his problem and that he's fought alongside them in many battles.
[02:40:38.332 --> 02:40:40.793]  And this just happens to be the Jabhat al-Nusra faction.
[02:40:41.113 --> 02:40:48.476]  So I just wanted to say that while ISIS is barbaric, we shouldn't forget about the barbarism of the other rebel groups which are sold to us as moderates.
[02:40:49.733 --> 02:40:57.438]  And again, most people in the government are not evil, so all this confusion is designed to confuse the military, the police, everybody.
[02:40:57.498 --> 02:41:03.923]  We're here decompartmentalizing this, and we've shown, years beforehand, we know what we're talking about right now.
[02:41:04.043 --> 02:41:05.624]  We are right about this.
[02:41:08.206 --> 02:41:09.727]  And we have been for a long time, I think.
[02:41:10.407 --> 02:41:11.248]  What's coming next?
[02:41:11.268 --> 02:41:13.730]  What do you think's gonna, what's the next big shoe to drop in the Middle East?
[02:41:14.881 --> 02:41:23.330]  I think that the idea for the Middle East is to keep them on a slow burn and keep the bloodshed going as long as possible and hopefully get some divided states.
[02:41:25.613 --> 02:41:32.720]  I think that with Ukraine and the world and where everything is going, I know, I'm sorry, did I jump ahead?
[02:41:32.740 --> 02:41:33.621]  No, go ahead.
[02:41:33.902 --> 02:41:34.783]  Let's talk about Ukraine.
[02:41:35.899 --> 02:41:52.331]  Well, I wanted to say, you know, at the end of the Cold War, one of the deals that went about before Warsaw was disbanded was that Ukraine would sort of stay a neutral ground that wouldn't be put into the NATO camp.
[02:41:53.172 --> 02:42:01.700]  Now, whilst Warsaw, the USSR's brand of NATO, was disbanded, NATO remains alive and well.
[02:42:01.800 --> 02:42:04.622]  And NATO's objective was to isolate Russia.
[02:42:04.983 --> 02:42:13.030]  And I believe that what's happening in Ukraine now follows what happened between the Georgia-Russian war only a few years ago,
[02:42:13.670 --> 02:42:21.055]  And what's happening in Syria as well is to continue basically to restart the Cold War and to continue to surround and isolate Russia.
[02:42:21.436 --> 02:42:23.757]  And that's heading towards dangerous ground.
[02:42:24.198 --> 02:42:27.600]  What happened in Maidan was basically a coloured revolution.
[02:42:28.241 --> 02:42:40.649]  Whether or not, you know, the government that was overthrown was an oligarchy, it was democratically elected, but whether or not, you know, the governments in Ukraine were an oligarchy, which I'm sure they were, you know, a lot of
[02:42:41.610 --> 02:42:52.192]  What happened was another oligarch was put into power, but in the meantime they created so much division and problems between the people and disenfranchised the Russian speakers.
[02:42:52.692 --> 02:42:58.174]  So it is a direct result of this colored revolution we're seeing happen in Ukraine now.
[02:42:58.554 --> 02:43:07.296]  And it just goes to show you that even if the Syrian president had stepped down at the start of 2011, it wouldn't have prevented a civil war.
[02:43:07.316 --> 02:43:08.276]  It would have
[02:43:08.536 --> 02:43:11.978]  Perhaps accelerated the balkanization and the division of Syria.
[02:43:15.921 --> 02:43:16.642]  Well, that's right.
[02:43:16.922 --> 02:43:24.587]  And again, it's the very same proxy war they're starting in Ukraine that they've started in Syria over the last almost four years.
[02:43:25.248 --> 02:43:29.911]  And what's wild about this is when you're just even barely paying attention, it's all in slow motion clear.
[02:43:30.271 --> 02:43:31.192]  It's all admitted.
[02:43:32.267 --> 02:43:36.289]  But on our news it's like, bad man Putin ordered planes shot down.
[02:43:36.609 --> 02:43:38.670]  He mean, we need to hurt him.
[02:43:39.370 --> 02:43:41.351]  And Putin mean, Putin bad.
[02:43:42.872 --> 02:43:45.913]  Putin evil, and you know, he's the brand new dictator.
[02:43:46.033 --> 02:43:51.156]  Yeah, Putin's missile, oh he's so, like he was there launching the missile himself.
[02:43:51.836 --> 02:43:55.678]  When it's hiding in plain view, why was a commercial airliner
[02:43:56.587 --> 02:43:58.909]  of the exact same make and model of the other missing one.
[02:43:58.990 --> 02:44:00.411]  I mean, this just gets a little too weird.
[02:44:00.611 --> 02:44:05.877]  It's basically impossible, folks, in my view, statistically, to fly through a restricted airspace area.
[02:44:07.118 --> 02:44:11.222]  And I had all these air traffic controllers, you name it, call in, and they said, yes, you're right.
[02:44:12.203 --> 02:44:13.905]  Just no one is allowed to fly in there.
[02:44:14.225 --> 02:44:15.226]  It's a huge area.
[02:44:16.467 --> 02:44:17.649]  And they fly right through it.
[02:44:19.448 --> 02:44:21.370]  When they shot down another plane the other day before.
[02:44:22.130 --> 02:44:24.852]  So, statistically, I think the Russians probably did shoot it down.
[02:44:25.713 --> 02:44:28.875]  But the issue is that they flew it through there.
[02:44:29.516 --> 02:44:36.582]  And we had an air traffic controller on earlier saying this will be the equivalent of in Vietnam flying a passenger jet over Hanoi.
[02:44:37.446 --> 02:44:42.071]  Over North Vietnam, and then freaking out saying, they shot down a passenger liner!
[02:44:42.311 --> 02:44:45.475]  Well you would ask, why did you fly a plane through a war zone?
[02:44:45.935 --> 02:44:50.300]  Whoever ordered it to fly through there is who did it, basically.
[02:44:52.242 --> 02:44:59.328]  I think it's very, very strange that nobody is able to fly over Syrian airspace.
[02:44:59.688 --> 02:45:12.379]  It was like that for many years where the US advised or the Civil Aviation Authority advised airliners not to fly over Syrian airspace, but somehow it was okay to fly over Ukrainian airspace.
[02:45:12.739 --> 02:45:15.982]  And that's because, you know, the responsibility is not on their hands.
[02:45:17.163 --> 02:45:20.305]  So I think that, you know, especially in that area,
[02:45:21.466 --> 02:45:24.989]  Where the responsibility lies, you know, to just say it's Putin.
[02:45:25.009 --> 02:45:31.033]  It's basically just such bias that we've been seeing in the media right now.
[02:45:31.133 --> 02:45:40.799]  Even I laugh because I also recall during the Winter Olympics, the media against the Winter Olympics was so strong because it was held in Russia.
[02:45:40.899 --> 02:45:47.343]  And I believe there was some hashtag like Putin fail or Russia fail or something along those lines.
[02:45:47.824 --> 02:45:48.664]  Just the beat up.
[02:45:48.784 --> 02:45:51.086]  And it's just like the return of the Cold War, I think.
[02:45:52.627 --> 02:45:56.069]  But this time, we act more like the old Soviets than Russia does.
[02:45:56.669 --> 02:45:58.470]  It's really freaking the military out right now.
[02:45:58.490 --> 02:45:59.550]  Let's go to some phone calls.
[02:46:00.451 --> 02:46:02.132]  We're going to go to, is it Huboo?
[02:46:03.612 --> 02:46:03.973]  Huboo?
[02:46:03.993 --> 02:46:05.033]  I always pronounce his name wrong.
[02:46:05.053 --> 02:46:05.713]  He's called before.
[02:46:06.214 --> 02:46:09.435]  And then we've got General, George, Mike, David, and others.
[02:46:09.936 --> 02:46:14.678]  And David's calling in Spain, so we'll go to him first after we talk to Huboo.
[02:46:15.338 --> 02:46:16.139]  Thank you for coming on, sir.
[02:46:19.039 --> 02:46:25.446]  Thank you very much indeed and as usual you've been spot on with the Ukrainian matter.
[02:46:25.866 --> 02:46:36.879]  But what is really the good thing that you do to humanity is that you've got a worldwide reach, a global reach, and you are doing the rebuttal in real time.
[02:46:37.352 --> 02:46:42.535]  Which means then it's not going to, something's not going to happen and then one month later we discover it.
[02:46:42.895 --> 02:46:45.496]  You are hitting him right in the nose.
[02:46:45.776 --> 02:46:47.297]  So good for you and bless you.
[02:46:48.318 --> 02:47:03.845]  The last time I called when Syrian Girl was on, I mentioned, and I'm not trying to toot my own horn, that it would help the Syrian authority to have Iranian and Hezbollah, and they did enter the fray and they did turn it around.
[02:47:05.767 --> 02:47:07.367]  Here's my question to a Syrian girl.
[02:47:09.008 --> 02:47:18.810]  Right now, it seems like ISIS has got a lot of booty, meaning they've got almost, by some estimates, two billion dollars, and they've got advanced armaments.
[02:47:19.450 --> 02:47:26.552]  If they are pushed out of Iraq, is this going to create almost a monstrous problem for Syria?
[02:47:28.032 --> 02:47:28.872]  Oh no, that's the plan!
[02:47:28.892 --> 02:47:33.875]  They're letting them wreck an order in Iraq, and then get more weapons, and then go back into Syria.
[02:47:33.915 --> 02:47:35.336]  This is clearly a regrouping.
[02:47:35.836 --> 02:47:40.898]  Either way, if they can't take Iraq, that's okay, because they can then regroup and smash back into Syria.
[02:47:40.938 --> 02:47:44.180]  Syrian girl, your take on Habu's great question.
[02:47:45.595 --> 02:47:48.076]  That's a really, really interesting point.
[02:47:51.757 --> 02:47:55.538]  Running away from Iraq and into Syria could also create problems for Syria.
[02:47:55.838 --> 02:48:01.920]  But at the same time, I think that ISIS is controlling oil fields in Iraq and in Syria.
[02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:03.881]  So it's sort of they're feeding each other.
[02:48:03.901 --> 02:48:07.902]  ISIS in Iraq is propping up ISIS in Syria and vice versa.
[02:48:08.202 --> 02:48:12.564]  So if we can get rid of them in Iraq, maybe it actually would be beneficial for Syria.
[02:48:13.064 --> 02:48:14.084]  And vice versa.
[02:48:14.445 --> 02:48:19.387]  I think that it's important for Iraq and Syria to coordinate attacks against ISIS together.
[02:48:19.407 --> 02:48:22.388]  And indeed they are sitting on a lot of booty.
[02:48:23.068 --> 02:48:24.749]  They have taken a lot of oil fields.
[02:48:24.809 --> 02:48:39.455]  But I think in order for them to have access to all of those oil fields and all of those weaponry and to achieve these military gains, they would have had to have had a strong backer and a lot of money coming in from a state for them to achieve this.
[02:48:40.862 --> 02:48:42.022]  All right, sir, good to hear from you.
[02:48:42.062 --> 02:48:42.482]  Thank you.
[02:48:42.742 --> 02:48:44.963]  Let's talk to David in Spain.
[02:48:44.983 --> 02:48:47.003]  Go ahead.
[02:48:48.444 --> 02:48:49.584]  Hi, Alex.
[02:48:49.844 --> 02:48:51.304]  My name is David.
[02:48:51.344 --> 02:48:52.925]  I'm calling from Spain, from Europe.
[02:48:54.485 --> 02:48:56.806]  I was just listening to the radio show.
[02:48:56.826 --> 02:49:02.707]  I was listening to a series of countries, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Russia, China.
[02:49:04.091 --> 02:49:05.372]  Even ISIS.
[02:49:05.912 --> 02:49:16.102]  And what I understand is that predominantly Iraq was, Saddam was a friend of the West, was funded and put in power by the West.
[02:49:16.932 --> 02:49:17.512]  I don't know.
[02:49:35.217 --> 02:49:42.960]  The 20th century, the West got involved with the Russian situation via the Rothschilds at some point.
[02:49:43.360 --> 02:49:49.963]  We know that Kissinger's been doing deals with China, and it's incredible.
[02:49:50.243 --> 02:49:54.125]  And I disagree with you though, Alex, because you say we're heading off to war.
[02:49:54.965 --> 02:49:55.865]  I don't think we are.
[02:49:56.326 --> 02:49:56.806]  Not yet.
[02:49:57.623 --> 02:50:04.347]  Because the Russians and the Chinese aren't powerful enough to have a good old bash at it, right?
[02:50:04.847 --> 02:50:09.630]  And they need to have better weapons, better military, better naval.
[02:50:10.991 --> 02:50:19.115]  And it's my belief that the West was selling them all that equipment and training, etc., just as they do with ISIS.
[02:50:19.816 --> 02:50:25.359]  And just as we know... Well, when I say we're marching off the war, just to be clear,
[02:50:26.567 --> 02:50:33.069]  There's already a bunch of wars breaking out in Africa, in Syria, all over the Middle East, in Ukraine.
[02:50:33.949 --> 02:50:34.889]  We're just here.
[02:50:35.029 --> 02:50:35.850]  You're in Spain.
[02:50:36.530 --> 02:50:38.330]  You've had riots in the streets off and on.
[02:50:38.370 --> 02:50:39.371]  Look what's happening there.
[02:50:39.971 --> 02:50:41.251]  So I think we're both right.
[02:50:41.291 --> 02:50:44.132]  But when I say nuclear war, I'm saying that card is in the deck.
[02:50:45.092 --> 02:50:48.693]  And it could happen if we don't worry about it and talk about it and think about it.
[02:50:49.414 --> 02:50:52.214]  But I tell you what, I'm going to come back and get Syria Girl's take on that.
[02:50:52.254 --> 02:50:53.875]  But what do you say to what I just said?
[02:50:55.246 --> 02:51:03.130]  My point is this, Alex, is it's the West who is selling them the equipment, and they're not going to be ready for another two, three years.
[02:51:03.210 --> 02:51:07.072]  Now, I mean the Joel Skousen... No, no, I agree with you.
[02:51:07.132 --> 02:51:07.673]  I agree with you.
[02:51:07.693 --> 02:51:08.233]  We'll be back.
[02:51:08.253 --> 02:51:08.633]  Stay with us.

[02:52:08.673 --> 02:52:13.675]  We travel so much, and having a fake TV, well, it gives added peace of mind.
[02:52:13.836 --> 02:52:16.957]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets.
[02:52:17.337 --> 02:52:23.340]  But fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[02:52:23.460 --> 02:52:35.386]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[02:52:35.706 --> 02:52:40.050]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.

[02:53:08.508 --> 02:53:12.470]  Hey folks, this is Larry Crisp for BabyBoomerBackupPlan.com.
[02:53:12.650 --> 02:53:15.812]  I don't have to tell you, this economy sucks!
[02:53:16.352 --> 02:53:23.455]  Unlike the political elite and Wall Street bankers, you know that debts don't disappear and bailouts have big consequences.
[02:53:23.875 --> 02:53:30.342]  Stock and real estate market bubbles can pop at any moment and evaporate most or all of your retirement savings.
[02:53:30.663 --> 02:53:34.867]  Folks, we're in the weakest economy of our lifetime and it's likely to get much worse.
[02:53:35.168 --> 02:53:41.074]  Virtually zero sectors of the economy are hiring and workforce participation is at record lows.
[02:53:41.515 --> 02:53:42.536]  And I'm here to tell you
[02:53:42.796 --> 02:53:48.361]  This may be the best thing that could happen to you if you move decidedly and develop a backup plan immediately.
[02:53:48.521 --> 02:53:54.187]  Proportionately more millionaires were created during the Great Depression than at any time in history.
[02:53:54.347 --> 02:53:56.228]  And history is about to repeat itself.

[02:54:25.311 --> 02:54:27.133]  By the way, I thought it was up there 30 minutes ago.
[02:54:27.153 --> 02:54:27.913]  It hadn't been put up yet.
[02:54:27.953 --> 02:54:29.894]  It's now been put up on InfoWars.com.
[02:54:29.954 --> 02:54:31.795]  We tweeted it out at RealAlexJones.
[02:54:31.815 --> 02:54:32.556]  Please retweet it.
[02:54:33.156 --> 02:54:36.198]  Matt Drudge predicted the future.
[02:54:36.358 --> 02:54:37.119]  Matt Drudge.
[02:54:38.357 --> 02:54:39.558]  Is a top futurist.
[02:54:40.479 --> 02:54:42.360]  Matt Drudge changed the world is the name of the video.
[02:54:42.380 --> 02:54:47.544]  We're going to make it the featured video on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube as well.
[02:54:48.785 --> 02:54:50.347]  So that's happening right now.
[02:54:51.908 --> 02:54:53.689]  Let's go back to Syrian Girl.
[02:54:54.670 --> 02:54:57.993]  David, I got to jump on to other people, but Syrian Girl, you want to comment on what he just said?
[02:55:00.410 --> 02:55:06.054]  I just wanted to correct some of the comments such as Russia and China are buying weapons from the US.
[02:55:06.474 --> 02:55:08.255]  I don't believe that that's true.
[02:55:08.395 --> 02:55:10.236]  I think China is still buying from Russia.
[02:55:10.256 --> 02:55:18.322]  I think the Russians might be buying microchips though from a French company called Fails because the US is still the best at microchips.
[02:55:19.102 --> 02:55:22.565]  I also wanted to correct about Assad being a friend of the West.
[02:55:22.985 --> 02:55:31.032]  Bashar al-Assad was actually, this current president, was being sort of, the West tried to seduce him in 2008.
[02:55:31.072 --> 02:55:32.473]  They set up Gaddafi too.
[02:55:32.513 --> 02:55:36.777]  He invested all their money, worked with them, let all their ops in, they set him up.
[02:55:37.337 --> 02:55:41.981]  And the same thing with Assad, he was trying to work with them while they got their people in place.
[02:55:42.722 --> 02:55:44.703]  But Assad wouldn't play the same ball game.
[02:55:44.763 --> 02:55:48.004]  I mean, Gaddafi decided to disarm himself with chemical weapons.
[02:55:48.364 --> 02:55:53.425]  But Assad, in 2004, they asked him to disarm his chemical weapons in exchange for peace.
[02:55:53.825 --> 02:55:54.606]  He said, you know what?
[02:55:54.906 --> 02:55:58.487]  I'll disarm with the entire Middle East, disarms of WMDs.
[02:55:58.527 --> 02:56:00.347]  That was proposed to the United Nations.
[02:56:01.188 --> 02:56:01.948]  Of course, the U.S.
[02:56:01.988 --> 02:56:12.151]  vetoed the proposal, and we ended up... Yeah, you gotta love how this moral high ground, where the West has all these weapons, then nobody else can have weapons, even if it never used them.
[02:56:12.970 --> 02:56:14.891]  It's like 9-11 happens and we blame Saddam.
[02:56:14.911 --> 02:56:18.233]  I mean, why not attack Australia?
[02:56:19.034 --> 02:56:20.234]  Or the North Pole?
[02:56:20.254 --> 02:56:22.136]  I mean, Iraq had nothing to do with 9-11.
[02:56:24.887 --> 02:56:25.467]  Absolutely.
[02:56:25.527 --> 02:56:29.189]  It's all part of the agenda to just disarm them of these weapons.
[02:56:29.529 --> 02:56:38.272]  And I wanted to agree with you, though, that we are already in a war and we are already heading towards a threat of war.
[02:56:38.352 --> 02:56:50.116]  And it's just it's like sticking your head in the sand if you don't examine the possibility of there being a more a war, let's say, where the West is involved, because that's really what
[02:56:50.416 --> 02:56:56.559]  Well, look, they're not building giant bunkers for the elite everywhere, and the elite aren't leaving Israel and other places for no reason.
[02:56:56.579 --> 02:56:57.419]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[02:56:58.299 --> 02:57:01.381]  But I agree with what David said, it's going to get worse down the road.
[02:57:01.801 --> 02:57:05.542]  I think things will just continue to deteriorate as long as these psychopaths are running things.
[02:57:06.423 --> 02:57:07.903]  And again, they hate us here in America, folks.
[02:57:07.923 --> 02:57:09.664]  The globalists hate us more than they hate the Syrians.
[02:57:10.204 --> 02:57:12.845]  They hate anybody that's sovereign, anybody that's got guns.
[02:57:13.666 --> 02:57:15.146]  Let's talk to George in Connecticut.
[02:57:15.166 --> 02:57:16.167]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:57:17.088 --> 02:57:24.491]  Hi Alex, I just have one question from Syrian Girl and a battle plan after I finish with her.
[02:57:24.571 --> 02:57:34.255]  One question, I had stayed with some of the very high officials in intelligence at their house and they had lots of connections with the airlines.
[02:57:34.595 --> 02:57:40.218]  Being you're in Australia and I'm sure you're a little bit familiar with the politics of Malaysia businesses north of you,
[02:57:40.798 --> 02:57:42.279]  Uh, where your residence is now.
[02:57:42.580 --> 02:57:47.423]  Do you think that either they were duped, or they were blackmailed, or there might be some sort of connection there?
[02:57:47.443 --> 02:57:48.164]  I'm just curious.
[02:57:49.605 --> 02:57:56.110]  Uh, do you mean the airline... Maybe somebody wanted to make sure that the airline would go bust?
[02:57:56.631 --> 02:57:58.572]  That was one thing that sort of occurred to me.
[02:57:58.612 --> 02:57:59.973]  Well, I mean, here's another deal.
[02:58:00.954 --> 02:58:06.438]  They just flew through Syrian airspace the day after the shootdown, where you're not supposed to fly.
[02:58:06.498 --> 02:58:08.380]  I mean, they're trying to get those planes shot down.
[02:58:10.486 --> 02:58:14.870]  It seems like it's just bizarre that it just happened to be a Malaysian airline twice.
[02:58:14.950 --> 02:58:17.092]  It's just, it's beyond a coincidence.
[02:58:17.172 --> 02:58:24.619]  But as to the reason why, I can't at this point make a guess because it wouldn't be accurate.
[02:58:24.659 --> 02:58:26.321]  Yeah, caller, what was your battle plan point?
[02:58:26.946 --> 02:58:31.270]  The battle plan point, I think we should do something that Amnesty International always does.
[02:58:31.310 --> 02:58:35.474]  They send letters out to various officials trying to either release people or whatever.
[02:58:35.894 --> 02:58:37.776]  In this stead, I think we should do the reverse.
[02:58:37.816 --> 02:58:45.703]  We should send postcards, only postcards, no World War III, no Lusitania II to George Soros.
[02:58:46.043 --> 02:58:47.084]  Hey, I tell you what, stay there.
[02:58:47.104 --> 02:58:48.185]  We're going to do some overdrive.
[02:58:48.585 --> 02:58:49.526]  We can get a final comment.
[02:58:49.546 --> 02:58:50.427]  George, I'm going to go to Mike.
[02:58:51.528 --> 02:58:53.331]  In general, I don't know if I can get to Michigan Patriot.
[02:58:53.351 --> 02:58:54.833]  We're gonna try.
[02:58:54.853 --> 02:58:55.774]  But that's a great idea.
[02:58:55.814 --> 02:58:57.196]  Let Soros know we know.
[02:58:58.991 --> 02:59:05.093]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential Fort Hood situation?
[02:59:05.113 --> 02:59:08.453]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[02:59:08.553 --> 02:59:10.154]  Here we go folks, I'm being assaulted!
[02:59:10.214 --> 02:59:16.455]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[02:59:16.555 --> 02:59:22.457]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[02:59:22.617 --> 02:59:26.379]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[02:59:26.559 --> 02:59:29.461]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[02:59:29.641 --> 02:59:37.646]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[02:59:37.926 --> 02:59:39.967]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[02:59:40.007 --> 02:59:41.048]  It's a war against the truth.
[02:59:41.428 --> 02:59:50.174]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.TV and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[03:00:01.322 --> 03:00:02.743]  Direct from Austin.
[03:00:03.364 --> 03:00:06.586]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:14.830 --> 03:00:18.992]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:19.672 --> 03:00:20.472]  You want answers?
[03:00:21.253 --> 03:00:22.153]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:22.793 --> 03:00:26.415]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:26.975 --> 03:00:29.536]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:29.556 --> 03:00:30.536]  Alright, folks, moving quick here.
[03:00:31.196 --> 03:00:32.297]  Let's go back to George.
[03:00:32.617 --> 03:00:33.857]  What was the finish up of your point?
[03:00:33.877 --> 03:00:35.018]  What do we put on these postcards?
[03:00:35.458 --> 03:00:37.159]  No World War III and send them to Soros?
[03:00:37.859 --> 03:00:41.160]  Yes, no World War III, no Lusitania II.
[03:00:41.501 --> 03:00:45.782]  Sent it to his weekend getaway in Southampton.
[03:00:45.902 --> 03:00:50.604]  It's 550 Old Town Road, Southampton, 11968.
[03:00:52.205 --> 03:01:02.809]  Or his home address, it's in Katona, New York, 136 Katito, C-A-N-T-I-T-O-E Street.
[03:01:03.090 --> 03:01:03.790]  Just that.
[03:01:04.370 --> 03:01:07.953]  Postcards from all over the world to show the whole world is fed up with this.
[03:01:08.293 --> 03:01:10.735]  Picture postcards so he knows it's from all over the world.
[03:01:11.016 --> 03:01:12.377]  I think it'll have a real impact.
[03:01:12.742 --> 03:01:16.883]  Well, I agree with you, and it's funny, I actually know his address because it's been in the news before.
[03:01:17.283 --> 03:01:25.505]  That big mansion on that farm he's got, and then right in the middle of the most expensive real estate in that area, and then he's got that place in New York.
[03:01:26.025 --> 03:01:28.266]  And this guy's trying to, this guy's a Nazi collaborator.
[03:01:28.886 --> 03:01:36.508]  And so I don't want any harm to come to him before he gets a trial, but why doesn't he get scooped up by these Nazi hunters like, you know, guys they can't even prove?
[03:01:37.408 --> 03:01:39.069]  It's just, I'm so sick of George Soros.
[03:01:39.089 --> 03:01:40.069]  I just want to throw up.
[03:01:40.942 --> 03:01:43.995]  Alright, Sherry and Girl, what do you think of that idea?
[03:01:46.111 --> 03:01:52.636]  I support the idea, but it's got to be also, as well, trying to wake up people.
[03:01:53.056 --> 03:02:05.584]  Because I think that what Amnesty International does, and all of those controlled humanitarian NGOs, is that it tries to make people active and in the meanwhile brainwash them about these ideas.
[03:02:05.804 --> 03:02:10.267]  Yeah, yeah, only be active on their fake causes to attack things.
[03:02:10.547 --> 03:02:12.769]  It's well on Amnesty's infiltrated and taken over.
[03:02:12.969 --> 03:02:14.350]  His point was take their tactics.
[03:02:15.331 --> 03:02:18.475]  Yeah, yeah, his point was just take the tactic and we've got to move quick now.
[03:02:18.575 --> 03:02:20.378]  Mike in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:02:20.398 --> 03:02:23.442]  Hi Alex, hi Steering Girl.
[03:02:23.762 --> 03:02:28.028]  Quick question for you, turn off the politics part of this.
[03:02:28.379 --> 03:02:36.022]  From your area of the world over there, I've always wanted this, being an American, always living in America, not traveling outside of America much.
[03:02:36.282 --> 03:02:39.483]  What do people think of Americans in general?
[03:02:39.523 --> 03:02:40.764]  Ooh, that's a great question.
[03:02:41.424 --> 03:02:42.964]  Gotta jump, but that's an excellent question.
[03:02:43.225 --> 03:02:45.045]  What do people think of the average American?
[03:02:46.266 --> 03:02:48.967]  Well, in Australia or in the Middle East?
[03:02:48.987 --> 03:02:49.227]  Both.
[03:02:50.407 --> 03:02:50.667]  Both.
[03:02:50.808 --> 03:03:01.603]  Well, what I specifically think about Americans, just putting it out there, is that I believe they're all, most, the vast majority of them actually want to do good.
[03:03:02.144 --> 03:03:06.189]  And unfortunately, a lot of them have been brainwashed and controlled.
[03:03:07.070 --> 03:03:11.651]  They're very, I find they're very, very easy to wake up, in fact, and very open-minded.
[03:03:13.092 --> 03:03:18.813]  But in Australia, I suppose there is this perception that the U.S.
[03:03:18.893 --> 03:03:27.916]  is an ignorant place, they don't really know what's going on, and basically they want to create these wars and they don't know geography.
[03:03:27.936 --> 03:03:30.897]  Well, sounds like they know what they're talking about in Australia.
[03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:37.084]  I love my country, but I mean, we do statistically have the most uninformed morons on the planet.
[03:03:37.524 --> 03:03:39.305]  And I'm just saying that so we can turn it around.
[03:03:40.766 --> 03:03:42.708]  Only the military and the police seem to be awake.
[03:03:42.728 --> 03:03:43.989]  That's because they kind of live in the real world.
[03:03:44.089 --> 03:03:45.870]  We're in a lot of trouble, folks.
[03:03:45.890 --> 03:03:46.711]  That's all I can say.
[03:03:47.471 --> 03:03:49.213]  General in Texas, last caller.
[03:03:49.233 --> 03:03:49.993]  Sorry to everybody else.
[03:03:50.474 --> 03:03:51.915]  Quick question or comment for Mimi.
[03:03:53.266 --> 03:03:53.526]  Both.
[03:03:53.606 --> 03:03:54.847]  I have the answer.
[03:03:54.927 --> 03:03:56.608]  We are about to take victory right now.
[03:03:56.628 --> 03:03:57.249]  I can't believe it anymore.
[03:03:57.729 --> 03:03:58.730]  Alright, real quick, Alex.
[03:03:58.930 --> 03:04:02.973]  I'm trying to get this started in two minutes, but if possible, we can speak after.
[03:04:02.993 --> 03:04:03.773]  No, we got about a minute.
[03:04:03.833 --> 03:04:04.133]  Go, go.
[03:04:04.153 --> 03:04:04.534]  We gotta go.
[03:04:04.554 --> 03:04:04.834]  We gotta go.
[03:04:05.669 --> 03:04:09.251]  On the inside, we have this feeling called anxiety, butterflies in your stomach, nervousness, depression.
[03:04:09.631 --> 03:04:11.292]  We all have to get rid of it now.
[03:04:11.332 --> 03:04:12.732]  This is faith, and this is love.
[03:04:12.792 --> 03:04:22.977]  Now, the reason why I say this is love, this is the piece that'll bring us all together, that'll energize the Infowar, that'll get us from thinking of game plans, like the guy just had, to executing game plans.
[03:04:23.257 --> 03:04:25.178]  And there's one last piece I gotta leave out there for everybody.
[03:04:25.598 --> 03:04:28.239]  Go to YouTube and check out Day of Glory 7773.
[03:04:28.279 --> 03:04:28.580]  D-A-Y-D-L-O-R-Y 7773.
[03:04:28.620 --> 03:04:29.480]  Gonna be seven videos on there.
[03:04:34.122 --> 03:04:42.944]  The main video that everybody has to look at is the Gospel quoted by Jesus Christ, where I read every single passage from Matthew to John, where Jesus tells you, again, eternal life.
[03:04:42.964 --> 03:04:43.584]  Well, good job.
[03:04:43.624 --> 03:04:45.105]  Good job for getting involved in doing that.
[03:04:45.145 --> 03:04:47.165]  Syrian girls, sorry to rush you there at the end.
[03:04:47.205 --> 03:04:48.786]  Thanks for coming and joining us.
[03:04:48.806 --> 03:04:52.927]  Thanks for staying up until 4 or 5 in the morning in Australia, and we'll talk to you again soon.
[03:04:53.956 --> 03:04:57.999]  Thanks a lot for having me and my best wishes to you and the American people.
[03:04:58.039 --> 03:04:58.439]  You too.
[03:04:58.499 --> 03:04:59.399]  Thank you so much.
[03:05:00.020 --> 03:05:03.002]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be back with retransmission.
[03:05:03.322 --> 03:05:06.764]  Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock Central, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[03:05:06.784 --> 03:05:07.445]  Great job, crew.
[03:05:09.686 --> 03:05:16.050]  By now, you may know that a Bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that's easily transferred from person to person over the Internet.
[03:05:16.350 --> 03:05:17.211]  No bank needed.
[03:05:17.491 --> 03:05:21.073]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.
[03:05:21.353 --> 03:05:22.514]  Plus, a large number of
