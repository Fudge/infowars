[00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:16.494]  Well, it sounds like the perfect script for a horror movie.
[00:00:16.854 --> 00:00:21.497]  A virus with no vaccine and no cure kills thousands of people.
[00:00:21.517 --> 00:00:23.779]  5 billion people died in 1996 and 1997.
[00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:28.902]  Almost the entire population of the world.
[00:00:31.363 --> 00:00:32.964]  Only about 1% of us survived.
[00:00:33.364 --> 00:00:37.767]  More reports of flu cases along the border, but officials are saying they aren't connected.
[00:00:38.194 --> 00:00:43.065]  Surely there's very real and very convincing data that the planet cannot survive the excesses of the human race.
[00:00:43.723 --> 00:00:48.485]  And I actually think the world will be much better when there's only 10 or 20% of us left.
[00:00:48.985 --> 00:00:50.066]  Dr. Eric Bianca.
[00:00:50.866 --> 00:01:10.814]  But most frightening was the fact that in a crowd of over 1,000 prominent scientists, local newspapers reported that 95% of those in attendance gave Bianca sustained standing ovations every time he extolled the virtues of mass culling microbes and man's destruction.
[00:01:11.607 --> 00:01:17.209]  And went on to laud the virtues of Ebola, because it would kill 90% of the world population quickly.
[00:01:18.089 --> 00:01:28.672]  The World Health Organization said on Tuesday the Ebola death toll jumped by almost 200 in a single day to at least 2,296, and is likely to be higher than that.
[00:01:29.112 --> 00:01:39.435]  The head of the US Centers for Disease Control confirmed Tuesday that West Africa is in a desperate situation, but that there is still hope that the outbreak can be reined in.
[00:01:39.915 --> 00:01:48.302]  A top German virologist has caused shockwaves by asserting that it's too late to halt the spread of the Ebola virus.
[00:01:48.382 --> 00:01:53.366]  In other news, the CDC is receiving reports of a possible flu outbreak in San Francisco.
[00:01:54.206 --> 00:02:03.254]  If the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on December 27, 1996, that makes us know that... It was released in Philadelphia probably on December 13, 1996.
[00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:06.996]  And it was seen sequentially after that in...
[00:02:08.248 --> 00:02:17.277]  San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
[00:02:17.657 --> 00:02:22.182]  Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, and Peking.
[00:02:22.202 --> 00:02:24.204]  That's some trip you're taking, sir.
[00:02:24.224 --> 00:02:25.205]  Is this all in one week?
[00:02:25.585 --> 00:02:25.906]  Business.
[00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:34.231]  One of the two Americans infected with the Ebola virus has arrived in Atlanta from Africa for treatment.
[00:02:34.251 --> 00:02:40.814]  The Massachusetts doctor arrived at the Nebraska Medical Center just before dawn this morning to be treated for Ebola.
[00:02:41.234 --> 00:02:46.336]  And right now, his or her blood sample is on its way to the Centers for Disease Control.
[00:02:46.356 --> 00:02:50.677]  The new ability to wage war is born from the blood of an infected person.
[00:02:51.598 --> 00:02:52.138]  There you see?
[00:02:53.238 --> 00:02:54.659]  Also invisible to the naked eye.
[00:02:55.595 --> 00:02:59.638]  It doesn't even have an odor.
[00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:05.202]  This Ebola outbreak is unprecedented and has become the deadliest on record.
[00:03:05.522 --> 00:03:07.264]  Ebola is now an epidemic.
[00:03:08.444 --> 00:03:14.149]  You start to get a sense of the rapid escalation now we're seeing of the virus.
[00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:21.114]  Imagine a virus, the most terrifying virus you can, and then imagine that you and you alone have the cure.
[00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:30.464]  Without specific drugs or a vaccine for Ebola, the only thing doctors can do for those suffering from this disease is treat their symptoms.
[00:03:30.804 --> 00:03:33.666]  Ebola is not spread through the air like the flu.
[00:03:34.366 --> 00:03:39.950]  One will not likely catch the virus just by nearing someone who has it.
[00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.571]  In 1989, Ebola made its way to the U.S.
[00:03:43.452 --> 00:03:47.294]  This new strain of Ebola had shown the potential to spread through the air.
[00:03:48.158 --> 00:03:50.101]  They are now calling this a true pandemic.
[00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:53.605]  Five years on, still no cure.
[00:03:53.865 --> 00:04:00.693]  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has given Â£31 million to help battle the Ebola epidemic in Africa.
[00:04:01.153 --> 00:04:06.719]  It is hoped it will also speed up the development of drugs and vaccines as Ebola has killed more than half of its 4,300 victims.
[00:04:09.612 --> 00:04:11.073]  First we've got population.
[00:04:11.474 --> 00:04:18.078]  Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[00:04:19.207 --> 00:04:26.349]  A preventative vaccine for the Ebola virus could be available as early as next year, as British pharma company GlaxoSmithKline.
[00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:40.673]  So you want to balance the need to get a potentially effective vaccine to the people who need it in a way that you can get some meaningful information as to A, whether it does work or not, and whether it does harm.
[00:04:41.013 --> 00:04:52.657]  A confidential GlaxoSmithKline document recently linked to the press exposed that within a two-year period, a total of 36 infants died after receiving the 6-in-1 vaccine of Infrix Hexa.
[00:04:52.917 --> 00:05:04.301]  UK pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline will plead guilty and pay a record-breaking US$3 billion to settle the largest case of healthcare fraud in US history.
[00:05:05.062 --> 00:05:06.222]  I'm going right out to get vaccinated.
[00:05:06.738 --> 00:05:12.922]  The vaccine uses a modified chimpanzee common cold virus to carry a single Ebola protein.
[00:05:13.102 --> 00:05:14.663]  We're ready to move on to the next phase.
[00:05:15.724 --> 00:05:16.264]  Does it work?
[00:05:16.785 --> 00:05:17.585]  Like we predicted.
[00:05:18.446 --> 00:05:19.867]  With one exception.
[00:05:20.167 --> 00:05:21.228]  We can't dawdle on this one.
[00:05:21.428 --> 00:05:29.213]  We have to move with force and make sure that we are catching this as best we can.
[00:05:29.493 --> 00:05:31.574]  Nearly two and a half thousand people have died.
[00:05:31.895 --> 00:05:33.396]  Thousands more have been infected.
[00:05:33.996 --> 00:05:35.857]  I made an international call for action.
[00:05:36.037 --> 00:05:38.418]  President Obama announced America's plan.
[00:05:38.518 --> 00:05:39.979]  Which will see 3,000 U.S.
[00:05:40.359 --> 00:05:42.020]  troops head to the region.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.501]  3,000 U.S.
[00:05:43.541 --> 00:05:44.321]  military personnel.
[00:05:44.341 --> 00:05:45.102]  Compare that to Iraq.
[00:05:45.122 --> 00:05:46.683]  There are 1,600 U.S.
[00:05:46.703 --> 00:05:47.843]  military troops in Iraq right now.
[00:05:47.863 --> 00:05:49.164]  We're talking about 3,000 troops.
[00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:52.145]  The true goal of this project is power.
[00:05:52.786 --> 00:05:55.007]  Complete and total hegemonic domination.
[00:05:55.734 --> 00:06:07.726]  At the request of the Liberian government, we're going to establish a military command center in Liberia under the pretext of humanitarian aid and dominate and occupy Africa through AFRICOM.
[00:06:08.346 --> 00:06:12.510]  The security firm HaloCorp announced it will conduct a zombie apocalypse training exercise.
[00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:20.242]  Al-Faraji will join about 40 other ghoulish friends in the Third World Village, where they'll bring on the apocalypse.
[00:06:20.542 --> 00:06:26.845]  Strategic Operations has trained some 600,000 military and law enforcement members using this technique.
[00:06:27.125 --> 00:06:29.226]  We've got it down to a science, if you will.
[00:06:29.306 --> 00:06:30.707]  If there is such a thing, it's an art.
[00:06:31.187 --> 00:06:37.470]  It's a government-made virus, designed, manufactured to put us out of our misery.
[00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:38.751]  They euthanized us.
[00:06:39.631 --> 00:06:42.553]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
[00:06:43.584 --> 00:06:46.766]  Now that's back from high school algebra, but let's take a look.
[00:06:46.786 --> 00:06:50.228]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:07:12.878 --> 00:07:15.779]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
