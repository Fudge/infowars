[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:07.432]  In the past decade, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:00:07.592 --> 00:00:13.835]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[00:00:13.855 --> 00:00:17.457]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[00:00:17.597 --> 00:00:21.499]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:00:21.799 --> 00:00:26.842]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:28.022]  Not our iodine.
[00:00:28.142 --> 00:00:31.704]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[00:00:31.944 --> 00:00:34.265]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.
[00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:36.346]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today.
[00:00:36.506 --> 00:00:37.867]  See the informational videos.

[00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.872]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.672]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:01:20.352 --> 00:01:21.153]  You want answers?
[00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:22.814]  Well, so does he.
[00:01:23.474 --> 00:01:27.137]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:01:27.657 --> 00:01:31.720]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:01:43.052 --> 00:01:58.953]  Well, if there's a great granddaddy of the liberty movement in this country, who's living and walking around, you have to say it's Ron Paul, there's a great grandma, it'd have to be Phyllis Schlafly, and the head of the Eagle Forum is going to be joining us coming up in one hour.
[00:01:59.614 --> 00:02:09.801]  to discuss what she thinks the 2014 realignment means and is there a chance to get true constitutional views expressed in the Republican Party looking ahead to the field in 2016.
[00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:18.588]  So we'll look back at last week's election and then we'll look forward as well dealing with
[00:02:20.826 --> 00:02:23.728]  2016 and how critically important it is.
[00:02:24.248 --> 00:02:28.431]  Phyllis Schlafly, constitutional lawyer, activist, author, and founder of the Eagle Forum, joins us today.
[00:02:28.451 --> 00:02:41.138]  We'll send another tweet out explaining that one of the, you know, the founding grand dame, or however you want to say it, probably the most influential
[00:02:42.714 --> 00:02:48.299]  Constitutional conservative living woman is joining us to discuss 2016.
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.004]  So that's really what's going on today with Phyllis Schlafly joining us in one hour.
[00:02:56.686 --> 00:03:05.073]  That said, this is one of those days, there's always a lot of news, but this is one of those days where I really hate myself because I know full well there's no way I can cover all this.
[00:03:05.093 --> 00:03:08.635]  But I have a tendency though to never get started.
[00:03:09.636 --> 00:03:10.837]  So I'm just going to get started right now.
[00:03:11.997 --> 00:03:20.803]  Out of everything we've got here in front of us, just look at this headline at InfoWars.com, and we have the clip from Ceaseman.
[00:03:22.445 --> 00:03:23.886]  Obamacare architect.
[00:03:24.666 --> 00:03:28.009]  Lack of transparency was key to fooling stupid Americans.
[00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:32.972]  And guys, will you pull me up the Fox News Ezekiel Emanuel, who was the guy that wrote most of it?
[00:03:34.513 --> 00:03:37.916]  Because if anybody's an architect, it's him, but this guy's a big part of it as well.
[00:03:39.537 --> 00:03:40.778]  They introduced him as an architect.
[00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:53.488]  Jonathan Grubber, Democratic Party operative, and he said lack of transparency was key to deceiving stupid Americans.
[00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:55.669]  This will be their downfall.
[00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.934]  When you study criminology, these people get off on dishonor, they get off on sitting around with their friends making fun of people.
[00:04:03.514 --> 00:04:07.197]  The ether in which they live, the sea in which they swim,
[00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:11.400]  Is public ignorance.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.762]  Christ said the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[00:04:14.782 --> 00:04:16.343]  I think the Bible says it five or six times.
[00:04:16.863 --> 00:04:17.864]  Knowledge is power.
[00:04:19.184 --> 00:04:20.145]  You shall know the truth.
[00:04:20.165 --> 00:04:21.346]  The truth shall set you free.
[00:04:21.366 --> 00:04:31.172]  I mean, I read the subsections where it had death panels and doubled your prices and had 21 taxes in it and was a giant tax screwjob from hell.
[00:04:31.192 --> 00:04:35.314]  And I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[00:04:35.694 --> 00:04:37.916]  And I wasn't hurt that they called me names myself.
[00:04:37.996 --> 00:04:39.677]  I was hurt that they were so evil.
[00:04:40.523 --> 00:04:50.949]  That they were such a pack of willful crooks preying on America with their trendy, non-threatening voices and ironic glasses.
[00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.352]  All meant by PSYOP generals to annihilate this country!
[00:04:56.673 --> 00:05:00.235]  And I'm just sick of looking at giant piles of dishonorable crap.
[00:05:03.953 --> 00:05:11.096]  We haven't figured out who did it around the office, but I've told the crew, use my Twitter to send out your articles and stories, and send out your tweets on my tweet.
[00:05:11.616 --> 00:05:16.538]  Just make it clear that it's you tweeting, not me, unless you hear a quote of something I say and want to send it out.
[00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:22.360]  Somebody sent out a thing saying, you know, you're not going to get our guns, Molon Labe, mother effers.
[00:05:23.781 --> 00:05:27.303]  And I'm not a guy that likes to use profanity on air, but at this point I just said, you know what?
[00:05:28.043 --> 00:05:29.063]  Whoever did it, give them a medal.
[00:05:29.924 --> 00:05:30.324]  Because
[00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:33.933]  I just can't put up with these crooks anymore, and that's what they are.
[00:05:34.974 --> 00:05:40.238]  A bunch of arrogant, crazed people in our face.
[00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:47.063]  I mean, there's got to be 20 videos of Democratic operatives on television saying they're going to screw us and laughing at us.
[00:05:47.723 --> 00:05:49.305]  Zuckerberg calling us dumb effers.
[00:05:51.346 --> 00:05:53.388]  Listen, pal, I'm not a dumb effer.
[00:05:54.548 --> 00:05:59.052]  And I don't like you crapping on me and trying to rub it in.
[00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:05.354]  And let me tell you, you little arrogant pieces of crap, it's your arrogance bragging that's gonna bring you down.
[00:06:05.535 --> 00:06:07.100]  That's what always brings crooks down.
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.702]  We'll be back.
[00:06:09.545 --> 00:06:19.747]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:06:20.107 --> 00:06:26.148]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:06:26.568 --> 00:06:28.788]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:06:28.908 --> 00:06:31.949]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[00:06:31.989 --> 00:06:38.870]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.873]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:06:43.033 --> 00:06:46.996]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:06:47.316 --> 00:06:48.777]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:06:49.098 --> 00:06:56.683]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:06:56.944 --> 00:06:57.804]  But for how long?
[00:06:58.105 --> 00:07:04.349]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.552]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:07:09.338 --> 00:07:10.559]  Another major health threat.
[00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:15.501]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:07:15.581 --> 00:07:18.202]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:07:18.262 --> 00:07:25.024]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:07:25.285 --> 00:07:28.146]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:07:28.266 --> 00:07:31.227]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:07:31.307 --> 00:07:33.228]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:07:33.248 --> 00:07:36.069]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:41.691]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:07:41.891 --> 00:07:45.392]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:07:45.412 --> 00:07:48.393]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:07:48.493 --> 00:07:55.595]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[00:07:55.815 --> 00:07:58.876]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[00:08:05.458 --> 00:08:07.920]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:08:09.241 --> 00:08:15.505]  When I first got online and I seen the price of the X2 and the DNA Force, I was a little hesitant, but I pulled the trigger on it.
[00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:16.606]  It has changed my life.
[00:08:16.626 --> 00:08:18.707]  I've been taking it for about 24 days now.
[00:08:18.807 --> 00:08:20.168]  Counting the weights, gaining shape.
[00:08:20.328 --> 00:08:22.750]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.291]  You've heard the callers of the show.
[00:08:24.331 --> 00:08:28.254]  Several months back, I started taking your nascent iodine and your super meal.
[00:08:28.334 --> 00:08:30.255]  Prior to this, I was barely walking.
[00:08:30.315 --> 00:08:32.977]  Now I'm able to function as a human again.
[00:08:33.097 --> 00:08:50.531]  Whether it's Survival Shield Nascent Iodine or DNA Force, Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality, Lung Cleanse, Fluoride Shields, Oxy Powder, I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com.
[00:08:50.991 --> 00:08:54.393]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[00:08:54.413 --> 00:08:55.373]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[00:09:18.422 --> 00:09:20.264]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[00:09:20.524 --> 00:09:23.107]  And I hope that judge ain't blind.
[00:09:23.127 --> 00:09:24.428]  Amarillo by morning.
[00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.541]  Amarillo's where I'll be.
[00:09:39.981 --> 00:09:44.302]  Thank you for joining us ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:44.642 --> 00:09:46.882]  We're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:09:46.902 --> 00:09:47.522]  to 2 p.m.
[00:09:48.103 --> 00:09:50.863]  Central Standard Time broadcasting worldwide.
[00:09:51.243 --> 00:09:54.724]  We return weeknight 7 o'clock Central InfoWars at Nightly News.
[00:09:55.144 --> 00:10:03.806]  Find showtimes and more at InfoWarsNews.com or PrisonPlanet.tv and of course we have a Sunday transmission.
[00:10:05.049 --> 00:10:21.996]  Well, I got up at about 6.15 this morning and I went over to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and I saw this headline by Paul Watson that I think we should red link and then add the Ezekiel Emanuel quote to it as well.
[00:10:23.757 --> 00:10:34.501]  And I saw the quote, Obamacare architect, quote, lack of transparency was key to fooling stupid Americans, close quote.
[00:10:35.996 --> 00:11:00.814]  And so I went over to the C-SPAN panel discussion, and there was this nobody of the system, working through the system, a parasite his whole life, in my view, my opinion, giddy and gibbering and blurting it out, that it was a lack of transparency and deceiving what was really in the bill and hiding the fact that it was really a tax.
[00:11:04.298 --> 00:11:07.281]  And that the ignorance of the electorate is how they got it done.
[00:11:11.224 --> 00:11:27.718]  And if you look at psychology, if you look at criminology, this is what sociopaths and psychopaths do, is they revel in getting together in their confabs, in their conclaves, in their gaggles, in their murders.
[00:11:28.579 --> 00:11:30.661]  That's what a large group of crows is called, a murder.
[00:11:31.889 --> 00:11:38.714]  They like to get together like ringwraiths around their victim and celebrate their open power.
[00:11:39.155 --> 00:11:40.476]  Yes, you've seized the country.
[00:11:40.516 --> 00:11:44.379]  Yes, you have a private bank called the Federal Reserve and ruling us for 101 years this December.
[00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:55.357]  Yes, you've dumbed down the public from the smartest, toughest, most creative group in the world to one of the dumbest, most pathetic groups on average.
[00:11:55.617 --> 00:11:58.359]  But there's still kernels of greatness there.
[00:11:58.399 --> 00:12:01.901]  There's still the ghost of the republic that could rise like a phoenix.
[00:12:05.124 --> 00:12:07.205]  With the spirit of George Washington, it's missed.
[00:12:07.886 --> 00:12:10.127]  That's why you fear it.
[00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:14.531]  Because you know countries and ideas can rise.
[00:12:15.279 --> 00:12:16.059]  Like the Phoenix.
[00:12:16.399 --> 00:12:17.920]  Like Lazarus from the dead.
[00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:24.182]  And so you celebrate your open evil.
[00:12:25.682 --> 00:12:27.303]  Obamacare architect.
[00:12:28.823 --> 00:12:30.904]  Lack of transparency was key.
[00:12:32.084 --> 00:12:32.744]  Key.
[00:12:33.925 --> 00:12:35.445]  Understand folks, they wrote it.
[00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:36.485]  We read the subsections.
[00:12:36.525 --> 00:12:37.286]  We knew what it would do.
[00:12:37.586 --> 00:12:41.727]  And they had CNN, MSNBC call you racist, call you anti-woman.
[00:12:42.407 --> 00:12:44.048]  Rush Limbaugh's getting ready to sue the Democrats.
[00:12:44.068 --> 00:12:44.588]  I think he should.
[00:12:46.112 --> 00:12:46.672]  I could sue him.
[00:12:47.653 --> 00:12:48.713]  My lawyer says, yes, you'd win.
[00:12:49.954 --> 00:12:53.336]  I've got listed Texas Monthly, actually the top lawyer.
[00:12:53.776 --> 00:12:56.077]  He's been number three once, number one another time.
[00:12:56.478 --> 00:12:58.699]  The point is, is yes, I could win, but what's the point?
[00:12:58.979 --> 00:13:00.320]  You guys discredit yourselves.
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.121]  Obamacare architect.
[00:13:03.601 --> 00:13:09.885]  Lack of transparency was key to fooling stupid Americans.
[00:13:12.046 --> 00:13:13.587]  And again, if you study criminology,
[00:13:14.773 --> 00:13:16.434]  They always get bolder and bolder.
[00:13:17.934 --> 00:13:24.757]  Psychopaths, on average, will kill one person a year, be very fastidious about how they do it, get away with it for 10, 20, 30 years.
[00:13:25.258 --> 00:13:28.639]  Then suddenly they go crazy and start killing somebody every week and get caught.
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.501]  They'll start dumping dead bodies out at the police station.
[00:13:32.521 --> 00:13:34.782]  They'll start mailing the cops taunting letters.
[00:13:34.802 --> 00:13:35.742]  I mean, everybody knows about it.
[00:13:35.782 --> 00:13:36.222]  It's famous.
[00:13:36.722 --> 00:13:37.603]  That's what this is.
[00:13:40.064 --> 00:13:41.825]  They're reckless and they want to be destroyed.
[00:13:41.865 --> 00:13:42.505]  They want to be caught.
[00:13:44.875 --> 00:13:47.517]  Because dominating us and destroying us isn't enough.
[00:13:47.557 --> 00:13:53.002]  They want us to know, and they want some more risk in it, because it makes it funner for them.
[00:13:53.923 --> 00:13:57.186]  A lot of people rob banks and stuff, not just for the money, they like the excitement.
[00:13:58.607 --> 00:14:03.631]  Like the Judas Priest song, breaking the law, breaking the law, breaking the law, breaking the law.
[00:14:06.494 --> 00:14:12.119]  In a newly uncovered video, which is public, Obamacare architect Jonathan Grubber
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:31.085]  What a perfect name, nothing against German names, but Grubber admits that a lack of transparency was key in getting the Affordable Care Act passed because the stupidity of the American voter, that's a close quote, would have otherwise killed the bill.
[00:14:36.343 --> 00:14:54.839]  From 2009 to 2010, Grubber, a professor of economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, served as a technical consultant to the Obama administration, during which time he helped craft the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as the giant Rape the American People Death Panel Screwjob Act.
[00:14:55.039 --> 00:14:58.702]  Excuse me, I didn't... The Monumental Galactic Fraud Act.
[00:14:59.557 --> 00:15:03.199]  Remember when Obama came out with the phone number, 1-800-FU?
[00:15:03.819 --> 00:15:06.401]  It actually spelled out the whole thing.
[00:15:06.421 --> 00:15:10.363]  And then they released another one that said, like, screw you.
[00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:13.964]  People said, wait, wait, it's not an accident.
[00:15:14.425 --> 00:15:17.326]  They're here to destroy you and your family.
[00:15:17.346 --> 00:15:18.627]  I'm going to play the clip.
[00:15:19.599 --> 00:15:24.864]  And I'm going to play Ezekiel Emanuel, who wants death panels and to kill people at 75, saying the same thing.
[00:15:25.424 --> 00:15:26.625]  Do you understand?
[00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:28.947]  It's meant to wreck the system.
[00:15:29.288 --> 00:15:29.928]  Period.
[00:15:29.968 --> 00:15:32.150]  Want to know why I'm angry?
[00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:43.781]  I don't know, but somebody says they're screwing me and my family and your family and laughing at me while they do it, and trying to wreck the healthcare system to get government control and death panels, not just for the troops.
[00:15:45.287 --> 00:15:47.527]  See, wherever you have government control is an example of how you live.
[00:15:48.468 --> 00:15:54.209]  I knew six years ago they started completely, they'd already been abusing them, they started putting troops on no treatment list.
[00:15:54.989 --> 00:15:56.289]  Joe Biggs is basically on one.
[00:15:56.609 --> 00:16:01.290]  No matter how many times he goes back, he can't get surgery for a bad knee, internal bleeding, all sorts of stuff.
[00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:07.571]  They put you, whether you're 25 or 75, on a list and you don't get health care.
[00:16:07.751 --> 00:16:12.052]  And then it came out that they're on a death list, don't treat, it's not even ration care.
[00:16:13.277 --> 00:16:15.100]  See, in England it's the same system.
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.642]  It's a socialist, eugenic system.
[00:16:17.684 --> 00:16:19.647]  I watch the parliamentary hearings all the time on C-SPAN.
[00:16:20.448 --> 00:16:24.875]  You'll have an operable brain tumor that's 97% operable in the particular speech I saw.
[00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:27.198]  And Tony Blair was Prime Minister at the time and he admitted it.
[00:16:28.348 --> 00:16:37.030]  The opposition got it and said, we have thousands of people waiting for lung surgery, heart surgery, brain surgery, where it's operable, but you make them wait 18 months and they die.
[00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:43.652]  And then they gave the example of the brain tumor that's operable if it's done within a few months, but made the guy wait a year, but then the brain tumor killed him.
[00:16:45.352 --> 00:16:47.833]  Tony Blair said, yes, it's true, we've messed up their problems.
[00:16:48.073 --> 00:16:52.474]  See, they'll admit they've, quote, messed up, no, it's on purpose, then say they're going to fix it.
[00:16:53.994 --> 00:16:55.875]  FEMA really messed up, we need double funding.
[00:16:59.053 --> 00:17:02.454]  They always mess up, and they need more power to get it fixed.
[00:17:02.474 --> 00:17:03.754]  No, they're not messing up.
[00:17:04.454 --> 00:17:08.995]  The mid-level and low-level compartmentalized people go, why is this agency so screwed up?
[00:17:09.616 --> 00:17:10.336]  Why do we do this?
[00:17:10.436 --> 00:17:10.996]  Why am I?
[00:17:11.016 --> 00:17:14.977]  Okay, the computer says don't give you treatment, but I'm not supposed to tell you that.
[00:17:15.037 --> 00:17:17.978]  I guess it's they don't have enough resources, but we're all sitting around here.
[00:17:17.998 --> 00:17:18.778]  We could do surgeries.
[00:17:19.358 --> 00:17:20.918]  Just says prescribe pills.
[00:17:21.358 --> 00:17:22.759]  That's what Obamacare is.
[00:17:23.139 --> 00:17:25.940]  It's globalized where the doctors can't make decisions.
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:27.240]  You understand that?
[00:17:29.912 --> 00:17:30.532]  This is it!
[00:17:30.852 --> 00:17:32.432]  You want Canadian or British health care?
[00:17:32.633 --> 00:17:42.874]  Paul Watson, a couple years ago, was coughing up blood for three weeks, had horrible strep in his lungs, kept going to the state-run system, couldn't get to private care until they authorized him.
[00:17:43.034 --> 00:17:44.955]  They have to give you permission to then go to a private clinic.
[00:17:46.435 --> 00:17:53.416]  They kept giving him a little pack, like the military does, with some aspirin, Tylenol, and stuff in it.
[00:17:53.436 --> 00:17:56.417]  And he had stuff eating his lungs, and they wouldn't give him help.
[00:17:57.608 --> 00:17:58.869]  That's government control.
[00:17:58.909 --> 00:17:59.750]  Do you understand?
[00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:01.712]  And now it's all happening!
[00:18:03.313 --> 00:18:05.455]  And you're getting double, tripling of your premiums.
[00:18:05.695 --> 00:18:07.477]  Now they say, get ready, it's about to go up even more.
[00:18:07.797 --> 00:18:09.719]  Every one I know, it's roughly doubled.
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:11.400]  Everyone.
[00:18:12.561 --> 00:18:17.106]  Some Texas plans, like Humana we showed has gone up 500 plus percent.
[00:18:17.286 --> 00:18:18.066]  We'll show the headline.
[00:18:18.847 --> 00:18:19.688]  Do you understand?
[00:18:20.408 --> 00:18:21.810]  And then they get up on television.
[00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:26.763]  Listen to him, like being Machiavellian and lying is a huge advantage.
[00:18:27.163 --> 00:18:35.886]  Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage, he added, and basically call, hit the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically, that was really critical for the thing to pass.
[00:18:36.206 --> 00:18:41.847]  Look, I wish Mark was right that we could be transparent, but I'd rather have this law than not.
[00:18:42.127 --> 00:18:50.670]  So he's saying, we premeditatedly lied to you, on purpose, on television, to bring in something that makes healthy people pay more.
[00:18:53.888 --> 00:18:57.226]  And they're sitting around with Democrats going, I'm sorry, we've got to deceive people.
[00:18:58.885 --> 00:18:59.705]  Do you understand?
[00:18:59.745 --> 00:19:00.686]  These are not liberals.
[00:19:01.286 --> 00:19:04.587]  Now, this guy may be a useful idiot and believes it's good to have a socialist system.
[00:19:04.767 --> 00:19:05.828]  It's not even a socialist system.
[00:19:06.028 --> 00:19:07.669]  It's a eugenics fascist system.
[00:19:08.109 --> 00:19:10.170]  Let's go to the clip of Gruber.
[00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.491]  It's just, you can't do it, politically.
[00:19:12.511 --> 00:19:13.671]  You just literally cannot do it.
[00:19:14.111 --> 00:19:14.291]  Okay?
[00:19:14.592 --> 00:19:17.953]  Transparent financing, and let's talk transparent financing, also transparent spending.
[00:19:18.433 --> 00:19:24.396]  I mean, this bill was written in a tortured way to make sure CBO did not score the mandate as taxes.
[00:19:25.016 --> 00:19:26.877]  If CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies.
[00:19:27.702 --> 00:19:29.946]  Okay, so it's written to do that.
[00:19:29.986 --> 00:19:38.180]  In terms of risk-rated subsidies, if you had a law which said healthy people are going to pay in, it made explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed.
[00:19:38.806 --> 00:19:44.270]  Okay, just like the kind of people, transparent, lack of transparency is a huge political advantage.
[00:19:44.891 --> 00:19:48.033]  And basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever.
[00:19:48.553 --> 00:19:52.456]  But basically, that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass.
[00:19:52.636 --> 00:19:54.077]  And you know, it's the second best argument.
[00:19:54.338 --> 00:19:55.518]  Look, I wish Mark was right.
[00:19:55.538 --> 00:19:56.659]  We can make it all transparent.
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.421]  But I'd rather have this law than not.
[00:19:58.561 --> 00:19:59.942]  So it's kind of like his reporter story.
[00:20:00.262 --> 00:20:01.623]  You know, I wish it could change.
[00:20:01.823 --> 00:20:02.283]  Yeah, there you go.
[00:20:02.323 --> 00:20:03.144]  Go ahead and lie to reporters.
[00:20:03.184 --> 00:20:03.484]  Yeah.
[00:20:03.924 --> 00:20:06.805]  The whole clip's up on infowarriors.com if you don't want to get nauseated.
[00:20:06.825 --> 00:20:08.826]  Of course, he's being deceptive here as well.
[00:20:09.367 --> 00:20:13.589]  We're going to lie to people, bring in the screw job, so healthy people can pay for sick people.
[00:20:13.609 --> 00:20:13.649]  No.
[00:20:15.447 --> 00:20:20.332]  No, it's phasing out the free health care that the states and cities and charities had and federalizing everything.
[00:20:20.912 --> 00:20:22.514]  And let me tell you, this economist knows.
[00:20:23.115 --> 00:20:28.520]  I can look at those little piggy eyes and these people that are into evil and deception are weak.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.565]  So they've decided to cheat in life to defeat those of us that are moral.
[00:20:35.228 --> 00:20:37.509]  And then they've also dumbed down the general public.
[00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:43.232]  So even if you're moral, you're this well-meaning, bleeding heart that goes, I want to do Obamacare to help people.
[00:20:43.673 --> 00:20:44.853]  You know, there's rich people.
[00:20:44.873 --> 00:20:45.874]  We need to make them pay.
[00:20:46.394 --> 00:20:47.935]  Stop being such chumps.
[00:20:48.755 --> 00:20:50.256]  Stop being such morons.
[00:20:50.657 --> 00:20:55.639]  Collectivism never works on a mass scale because it's too complex and the elites set it up as a tyranny.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:01.523]  Collectivism does work communally with agreement in very small groups of less than 100.
[00:21:02.183 --> 00:21:03.924]  But that isn't what we're talking about.
[00:21:04.365 --> 00:21:07.322]  There's natural collectivism and false collectivism.
[00:21:07.362 --> 00:21:07.744]  Stay with us.

[00:21:44.476 --> 00:21:46.637]  It's happening now, right here in the United States.
[00:21:46.937 --> 00:21:48.277]  And your rights are at risk.
[00:21:48.538 --> 00:21:50.478]  If passed, H.R.
[00:21:50.498 --> 00:21:52.639]  5344 would ban Level 3 and above body armor.
[00:21:52.899 --> 00:21:54.839]  KD Armor is standing up for you.

[00:22:07.563 --> 00:22:08.403]  Come and take it.
[00:22:08.903 --> 00:22:10.804]  Americans, you are being lied to.
[00:22:11.044 --> 00:22:16.948]  Does your skin crawl when a politician or a stock market guru say that we are in the midst of an economic recovery?
[00:22:17.148 --> 00:22:21.150]  According to top insiders, the largest financial meltdown in history is coming.
[00:22:21.311 --> 00:22:25.293]  You can prepare, but if you're living paycheck to paycheck, how do you find the cash?
[00:22:25.613 --> 00:22:29.836]  If you're fortunate enough to have retirement savings, it's probably not enough.
[00:22:29.996 --> 00:22:33.538]  And if it's in the market, it could be wiped out just like the last crash.
[00:22:33.738 --> 00:22:36.720]  But this time it will almost certainly be much worse.
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:42.184]  Precious metals are a great hedge, but they won't generate immediate cash flow to pay the bills.

[00:23:23.237 --> 00:23:27.180]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time?

[00:23:29.622 --> 00:23:32.684]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[00:23:32.924 --> 00:23:34.125]  Children left with no home.
[00:23:34.165 --> 00:23:35.486]  And no one's coming to help them.

[00:25:22.057 --> 00:25:30.342]  By the way, if you just joined us, Anthony Gucciardi went up to Dallas this weekend to investigate.
[00:25:33.124 --> 00:25:46.312]  You know, we had a medical doctor on three weeks ago at Maine National News out of Missouri, who named the hospital where doctors had told him that people that they appeared to have Ebola were being disappeared.
[00:25:46.852 --> 00:25:50.875]  Then we had senior Border Patrol people on, on record, off record,
[00:25:52.984 --> 00:25:54.805]  It became a national news story but died.
[00:25:54.825 --> 00:26:00.947]  Melantony, this weekend, went up to Dallas to investigate.
[00:26:02.567 --> 00:26:04.348]  And the doctors are very scared.
[00:26:05.148 --> 00:26:09.189]  They think the hospitals are going to get the liability and the blame for being part of this cover-up.
[00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:20.493]  You know the Forbes writer last week came out and said he was at a press conference with the CDC head and that the AP and everybody were talking about how they'd agreed to cover up what appeared to be Ebola cases.
[00:26:20.593 --> 00:26:22.334]  So, it's confirmed now.
[00:26:24.269 --> 00:26:30.054]  And what Anthony discovered, I don't even know if I want to get him on today.
[00:26:30.074 --> 00:26:44.006]  I think I might want to write articles about it and then not gather more proof, but just think about this story and how we want to put it out.
[00:26:45.367 --> 00:26:49.790]  Not to spin it, I just need to mull it over because it's real bad.
[00:26:57.334 --> 00:26:59.595]  This country is so screwed up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:00.695 --> 00:27:05.936]  The public has no idea what's going on, because they're blissfully ignorant, and they're counting on our ignorance.
[00:27:06.756 --> 00:27:08.676]  I used the example 50 times in the last few months.
[00:27:10.837 --> 00:27:13.137]  The Border Patrol said we've been ordered to stand down in January.
[00:27:13.417 --> 00:27:23.439]  It took us four or five months to go down and confirm it, and then the New York Times had to admit it a month later, that they load them on buses and give them vouchers, our government does, at the border, and ship them wherever they want to go.
[00:27:24.161 --> 00:27:31.224]  And then Border Patrol agents came out and said, we complete the smuggling process on Fox News, triple confirming what we reported.
[00:27:31.805 --> 00:27:38.548]  But we showed the emergency manager in the city of McAllen saying, no, we're here, and they give them the vouchers and we load them on buses.
[00:27:40.009 --> 00:27:41.929]  We were sent down there by an ICE whistleblower.
[00:27:41.969 --> 00:27:43.350]  We met with them in a hotel room.
[00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:45.791]  They didn't even want their voice recorded.
[00:27:47.052 --> 00:27:48.392]  We're going to send reporters back down there.
[00:27:48.412 --> 00:27:53.295]  And the reason I raise this is, if they can hide bringing millions of people in, and let me tell you, it's millions.
[00:27:54.133 --> 00:27:59.056]  It's 300,000 kids they're now saying, and that's only 17% of what's come in in the Border Patrol numbers.
[00:27:59.376 --> 00:28:00.236]  And that's what we know about.
[00:28:00.537 --> 00:28:04.619]  So what's 17% of 300,000 now in the last year, roughly?
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:06.500]  I don't know.
[00:28:08.041 --> 00:28:08.581]  It's millions.
[00:28:09.101 --> 00:28:09.902]  Millions that have come in.
[00:28:11.391 --> 00:28:15.772]  There's the headline, caught red-handed, Border Patrol paying to ship illegals deep in the U.S.
[00:28:15.792 --> 00:28:18.192]  You can watch the video there, InfoWars.com.
[00:28:18.892 --> 00:28:25.694]  If they can cover up millions of people being brought in and the government putting them on buses, and little InfoWars has to go expose it?
[00:28:27.634 --> 00:28:33.195]  You know AP, Reuters, Fox News, all of them, the New York Times, they're all down there.
[00:28:33.495 --> 00:28:34.435]  They all know too.
[00:28:34.775 --> 00:28:36.416]  Don't you think Border Patrol's gone to them?
[00:28:36.676 --> 00:28:37.436]  They do go to them.
[00:28:40.114 --> 00:28:43.336]  Don't you think Tosh Plumlee went to Fox News first and CNN?
[00:28:43.797 --> 00:28:44.077]  Yes.
[00:28:45.598 --> 00:28:49.260]  They come to us because they know we will verify their story and then go with it.
[00:28:50.061 --> 00:28:55.504]  Why do you think federal marshals and state police come to us with secret documents on targeting the Liberty Movement?
[00:28:56.045 --> 00:28:57.386]  Because nobody else believed them.
[00:28:58.607 --> 00:29:00.108]  We weren't the first people they went to.
[00:29:00.928 --> 00:29:06.292]  But because we've been doing this so long, we now are the first people folks go to.
[00:29:07.625 --> 00:29:10.087]  And by the way, I don't like that responsibility.
[00:29:10.448 --> 00:29:12.850]  I am sick of this 20-year war I've been in.
[00:29:14.571 --> 00:29:15.692]  I'm not scared of these people.
[00:29:16.653 --> 00:29:21.278]  I get so angry at people like Ezekiel Emanuel and Gruber.
[00:29:22.233 --> 00:29:33.318]  Making jokes about Obamacare when it's got death panels for old people, for handicapped kids, for the veterans, and is screwing everybody over to shut the economy down, and raping everybody's paycheck!
[00:29:33.539 --> 00:29:37.961]  It's like being mugged every month by these smiley-faced pieces of crap!
[00:29:38.641 --> 00:29:43.523]  And I'm sorry to be talking like that, but I mean, what won't we put up with in this country?
[00:29:44.083 --> 00:29:50.666]  I want that stinking Republican Party to repeal the whole thing right now, and I want criminal investigations.
[00:29:51.047 --> 00:29:59.070]  We have the criminals bragging about deceiving us in a giant screwjob, and deceiving Congress, and not calling it a tax.
[00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:01.011]  Congress wasn't deceived, they played along.
[00:30:02.483 --> 00:30:11.687]  I want the people in this monumental screw job admitting they've committed deception for money in the public purse that will hurt the public good and kill people.
[00:30:12.067 --> 00:30:13.968]  I want them indicted!
[00:30:15.628 --> 00:30:18.069]  I am sick of watching the Feds harass.
[00:30:18.269 --> 00:30:24.452]  There's an article out today about the Feds harassing the Liberty Movement with CBS reporters and others talking about it.
[00:30:24.572 --> 00:30:28.373]  Is Barack Obama attempting to harass and intimidate media personalities on his enemy list?
[00:30:28.573 --> 00:30:29.774]  And then it just goes through the cache.
[00:30:31.661 --> 00:30:36.864]  When we come back, I'm going to play the clip of Ezekiel Emanuel laughing and saying it's meant to wreck healthcare.
[00:30:38.245 --> 00:30:38.805]  You understand?
[00:30:39.065 --> 00:30:39.606]  They admit.
[00:30:40.206 --> 00:30:47.790]  They want to destroy America and bankrupt you and your family so you are totally dependent on them.
[00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:52.613]  And if that doesn't make you angry, something is wrong with you!
[00:30:53.173 --> 00:30:57.096]  It's time for America and the world to awaken!
[00:30:58.874 --> 00:31:01.863]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:31:02.805 --> 00:31:05.493]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:31:09.847 --> 00:31:19.373]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super-oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[00:31:19.513 --> 00:31:29.258]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:31:29.438 --> 00:31:32.360]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:33.181]  I think so.
[00:31:47.517 --> 00:31:47.777]  We're good.
[00:32:09.614 --> 00:32:20.097]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[00:32:20.177 --> 00:32:26.178]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:32:26.618 --> 00:32:28.839]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:32:28.959 --> 00:32:32.019]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[00:32:32.059 --> 00:32:38.921]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:32:39.443 --> 00:32:42.944]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:32:43.084 --> 00:32:47.065]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:32:47.365 --> 00:32:48.825]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:32:49.145 --> 00:32:56.747]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:32:57.007 --> 00:32:57.848]  But for how long?
[00:32:58.148 --> 00:33:04.409]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:07.590]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:33:09.298 --> 00:33:10.299]  The experts are clear.
[00:33:10.599 --> 00:33:17.585]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:33:17.725 --> 00:33:23.991]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:24.011 --> 00:33:27.594]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[00:33:27.714 --> 00:33:31.615]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:33:31.935 --> 00:33:36.977]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:33:37.257 --> 00:33:38.157]  Not our iodine.
[00:33:38.257 --> 00:33:44.420]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to be completely pure.
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:46.460]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.001]  See the informational videos.
[00:33:48.221 --> 00:33:50.041]  Read the information there compiled.

[00:33:55.203 --> 00:33:55.584]  We're good.
[00:34:21.567 --> 00:34:29.289]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:34:39.033 --> 00:34:40.894]  You think you've private lives?
[00:34:40.954 --> 00:34:42.714]  Think nothing of the kind.
[00:34:44.075 --> 00:34:45.675]  There is no true escape.
[00:34:45.955 --> 00:34:47.116]  I'm elemental!
[00:34:47.456 --> 00:34:49.276]  My sight is clean!
[00:34:49.436 --> 00:34:50.397]  I am perpetual!
[00:34:51.777 --> 00:34:53.818]  I keep the country free!
[00:35:03.712 --> 00:35:07.514]  Yep, that's the NSA screaming at you with their total surveillance of you and your family.
[00:35:07.935 --> 00:35:20.201]  All the data being used by the technocrats to corner humanity, to target us, to shut down the farms, to shut down the ranches, to shut down the industries, to shut down you and your family, to shut down the lemonade stands.
[00:35:20.901 --> 00:35:26.444]  All HUMET is being turned loose against the people of the planet as well by the globalists.
[00:35:27.759 --> 00:35:45.509]  But this is the key time for the globalists, because their own minions, their own human servants, who on average believe they're doing what they're doing for the greater good, are now faced with this non-injustifies-the-means that the globalists plan to bring the world into a total and complete tyranny.
[00:35:46.249 --> 00:35:48.391]  An anti-human tyranny.
[00:35:50.652 --> 00:35:51.492]  That's what's going on.
[00:35:54.454 --> 00:35:55.515]  And they're so arrogant,
[00:35:56.325 --> 00:36:05.493]  That people like Ezekiel Emanuel last year go on Fox News and say, yeah, the plan is to bankrupt health care and force it into a national health care system.
[00:36:07.254 --> 00:36:08.996]  Let me explain something to you socialists that want that.
[00:36:09.516 --> 00:36:12.939]  Have you actually lived in Europe or lived in England or Canada?
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.100]  They hate it.
[00:36:15.301 --> 00:36:16.102]  They dread it.
[00:36:16.122 --> 00:36:18.124]  It is a disaster by design.
[00:36:21.072 --> 00:36:23.053]  You really thought you'd get that free lottery ticket?
[00:36:23.553 --> 00:36:25.473]  You really thought you'd throw that Hail Mary and make it?
[00:36:25.753 --> 00:36:26.614]  You really think?
[00:36:26.874 --> 00:36:28.554]  They've already seduced the nation.
[00:36:28.734 --> 00:36:30.775]  The globalists have already taken over much of the planet.
[00:36:31.255 --> 00:36:35.897]  Now they're going to start cutting the chicken feet off because it's time to butcher.
[00:36:40.258 --> 00:36:42.479]  It's time to cull the herd.
[00:36:42.519 --> 00:36:43.059]  They're done.
[00:36:43.299 --> 00:36:44.639]  It's a post-industrial world.
[00:36:45.319 --> 00:36:49.901]  The world's being built to be savage and to have a reduction in the population.
[00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:55.733]  A fallen, failed world by design, because that's what the spirit of the world wants to build.
[00:36:56.793 --> 00:36:58.434]  Only the elites will have technology.
[00:36:58.815 --> 00:37:00.295]  Only the elites will have life extension.
[00:37:00.676 --> 00:37:03.157]  Only the elites will have life in the final equation.
[00:37:05.538 --> 00:37:15.084]  Imagine government with foreign corporations controlling it, running your healthcare, telling your doctor via computer terminal what to do now as a social service agent of the system.
[00:37:17.315 --> 00:37:20.837]  Because until now, a lot of people in the social service system have not been bad.
[00:37:21.257 --> 00:37:27.241]  Now you'll be a biological robot that follows the computer's orders, and the GPS in your car's orders.
[00:37:28.582 --> 00:37:30.763]  Or you will be relieved of your job.
[00:37:31.043 --> 00:37:32.924]  You're having your discretion taken away.
[00:37:34.325 --> 00:37:40.029]  And there is a Great Awakening happening, because if we don't fully awake, we will be overtaken by scientific evil.
[00:37:41.067 --> 00:37:52.930]  Now let's play the clip of Ezekiel Emanuel, the White House Chief of Staff's brother, the doctor, who just wrote an article a few weeks ago for Time Magazine saying we should get rid of people by law at 75 basically.
[00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:58.252]  Here he is admitting what Obamacare was meant to do, a torpedo to bring down the system.
[00:37:59.912 --> 00:38:03.235]  People who knew the law as it was being written knew the president wasn't telling the truth.
[00:38:03.295 --> 00:38:06.337]  The grandfather provision written into the law itself was too narrow.
[00:38:06.637 --> 00:38:11.041]  And frankly, they wrote a regulation intentionally trying to get people out of the individual market.
[00:38:11.321 --> 00:38:15.685]  They want the people to go into the exchanges because there's a lot of people in the individual market.
[00:38:15.885 --> 00:38:20.228]  The whole point of the exchanges is to close down the individual insurance market over time.
[00:38:20.268 --> 00:38:23.311]  They wanted to move millions of people into the exchanges.
[00:38:23.551 --> 00:38:24.492]  It was intentional.
[00:38:24.972 --> 00:38:28.054]  Insurance companies don't like the individual market as it's constructed.
[00:38:28.094 --> 00:38:29.014]  They see the future.
[00:38:29.314 --> 00:38:30.975]  That individual market is going away.
[00:38:31.015 --> 00:38:32.216]  They don't want to invest in it.
[00:38:32.256 --> 00:38:34.137]  But that's not what the president said.
[00:38:34.157 --> 00:38:35.177]  Let me finish.
[00:38:35.677 --> 00:38:45.122]  Another Lord of the Rings analogy where Gandalf, in the Fellowship of the Ring, the first one, goes in and is talking to Saruman.
[00:38:47.003 --> 00:38:49.764]  And he turns to him and he says, you must join with Sauron.
[00:38:50.985 --> 00:38:51.806]  It is the future.
[00:38:51.846 --> 00:38:52.806]  It's already happened.
[00:38:52.866 --> 00:38:54.207]  Nothing can stand in its way.
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:56.081]  See the future.
[00:38:56.141 --> 00:38:57.721]  There is only one way to go.
[00:38:57.741 --> 00:38:59.242]  That's what they always do.
[00:38:59.342 --> 00:39:00.583]  This is the way to go.
[00:39:00.983 --> 00:39:03.905]  World government and the microchip population is here.
[00:39:04.285 --> 00:39:17.312]  The population will be reduced and you should join with the system and work and make yourself worthy so that you and your family can live in the new future world in one of the handful of affluent megacities.
[00:39:18.288 --> 00:39:21.769]  Join with the New World Order and you can have the life extension.
[00:39:22.189 --> 00:39:24.949]  Join with it and your family can be safe.
[00:39:25.609 --> 00:39:34.451]  Join with it and you can be protected from the mob of the public that will tear you apart and doesn't want you and doesn't want to be helped.
[00:39:35.431 --> 00:39:37.471]  Join with world governance.
[00:39:40.912 --> 00:39:42.252]  It's who you belong with.
[00:39:43.933 --> 00:39:46.153]  I have been given that speech but a little bit milder.
[00:39:47.737 --> 00:39:51.995]  About eight times by powerful corporate heads, billionaires, you name it.
[00:39:55.219 --> 00:40:00.945]  I've even had the Kissinger Group on once, Rothkopf, and I said it during the break, John Harmon heard it, but he also said it on air, we had to find an interview to re-air it.
[00:40:01.285 --> 00:40:02.306]  I said, why'd you want me to come on here?
[00:40:02.326 --> 00:40:05.750]  And he goes, I just thought we could reach out to you and you'd be reasonable, Alex.
[00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:13.017]  You're in your own superclass, you know, as the person questioning things, and your capital's going to go up with the public as a lot of things happen.
[00:40:13.197 --> 00:40:14.699]  There's about to be a big power struggle.
[00:40:14.719 --> 00:40:16.881]  I mean, the future's set though, Alex.
[00:40:18.923 --> 00:40:30.152]  And basically they can just see the fact that what I'm saying is right, so they know that I'm gonna rise in popularity as all this truth comes out, so they're saying, you go ahead and do that, but at the time, be ready to join us or be destroyed.
[00:40:30.172 --> 00:40:38.558]  Do you understand how real all this is?
[00:40:40.679 --> 00:40:45.243]  That I've been up in skyscrapers in LA and New York, in huge offices,
[00:40:48.376 --> 00:40:52.479]  Back when I was making almost no money, but had a big audience and they could see the metric.
[00:40:55.982 --> 00:40:59.005]  And they said to me over and over again, happened locally, happened in New York.
[00:41:00.286 --> 00:41:00.966]  It's a line.
[00:41:00.987 --> 00:41:02.808]  It's how they got everybody else to sell it.
[00:41:02.828 --> 00:41:04.589]  They said, you can be on this crusade.
[00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:07.652]  You have a power to reach through the microphone and grab people.
[00:41:08.913 --> 00:41:10.334]  People follow your spirit.
[00:41:10.975 --> 00:41:14.157]  They resonate with you, but you're not going anywhere on this crusade.
[00:41:15.199 --> 00:41:17.681]  Do you want to be a star up there with all the other stars?
[00:41:17.981 --> 00:41:19.442]  Do you want to be assured your place?
[00:41:21.723 --> 00:41:23.984]  We're the people that understand you and appreciate you.
[00:41:24.385 --> 00:41:25.865]  We don't want to destroy you.
[00:41:26.326 --> 00:41:27.947]  The public does want to destroy you.
[00:41:29.167 --> 00:41:29.708]  Join us.
[00:41:32.269 --> 00:41:34.331]  And that's what all these little piggy people have done.
[00:41:34.391 --> 00:41:39.474]  Ezekiel Emanuel and this Obama advisor.
[00:41:41.715 --> 00:41:42.756]  Jonathan Grubber.
[00:41:43.916 --> 00:41:45.518]  He's saying, oh yeah, we lie to the public.
[00:41:45.838 --> 00:41:47.100]  Oh yeah, we deceive them.
[00:41:48.101 --> 00:41:49.623]  And so we've got to deceive the media too.
[00:41:51.366 --> 00:41:52.928]  Oh, you're letting it on the line!
[00:41:55.239 --> 00:42:00.463]  Do you understand the people running things put fluoride in the water to brain damage everybody?
[00:42:00.823 --> 00:42:03.806]  Do you really want to be in bed with those people?
[00:42:03.966 --> 00:42:18.558]  Do you feel safe trying to build a panopticonic, omnipresent, computer-assisted world government with elites that publicly meet constantly to try to bring in world government, merge with machines and live forever?
[00:42:18.578 --> 00:42:22.641]  ABC News, London Guardian, it's just constant!
[00:42:26.135 --> 00:42:33.720]  I talked about it when it wasn't in public publications, it was in their own books and stuff, which you could say are public, but only read by them.
[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:35.481]  Now it's everywhere.
[00:42:35.581 --> 00:42:38.943]  It's in the video games, the culture, because they're going operational.
[00:42:39.143 --> 00:42:42.465]  They're now entering the in-game stretch in the next 10-20 years.
[00:42:43.085 --> 00:42:44.366]  We've held them back a lot.
[00:42:45.126 --> 00:42:46.247]  But this isn't a game.
[00:42:48.888 --> 00:42:52.911]  I told you Obama would come out and say that he was going to federalize the internet to protect it.
[00:42:57.162 --> 00:42:58.022]  I'm going to break that down.
[00:42:58.062 --> 00:42:59.022]  That announcement's been made.
[00:43:01.563 --> 00:43:04.984]  Obama calls for the FCC to protect the Internet.
[00:43:05.824 --> 00:43:14.486]  Kind of like the mafia 100 years ago in New York would say, somebody burnt down a grocery store a few weeks ago because they didn't pay for insurance from the family.
[00:43:16.466 --> 00:43:26.048]  You might want to, you know, ask us to come in and hire some of our people and we'll keep an eye on the place for you and pay us 20% of what you bring in.
[00:43:27.256 --> 00:43:30.840]  And, uh, we'll even shut down your competition and, uh, you'll be part of the crew!
[00:43:31.901 --> 00:43:36.745]  So, uh, the FCC's gonna come in and, uh, protect, protect the Internet!
[00:43:36.805 --> 00:43:37.546]  Ha ha ha!
[00:43:37.906 --> 00:43:39.408]  You're gonna like it!
[00:43:39.668 --> 00:43:41.890]  Don't make me hurt you!
[00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:43.031]  Break your legs!
[00:43:43.432 --> 00:43:44.393]  You like your daughter?
[00:43:44.413 --> 00:43:47.035]  Listen, listen to me, you little punk.
[00:43:47.376 --> 00:43:49.297]  You're gonna do what we say, we're gonna break your legs.
[00:43:50.038 --> 00:43:50.819]  Next, you know we're gonna
[00:43:52.605 --> 00:43:53.545]  You like living like that?
[00:43:53.605 --> 00:43:55.046]  Well, you're about to, okay?
[00:43:55.626 --> 00:44:19.572]  A nation of sheep will be ruled by wolves, and you beg on your knees to be slaves, while these fat, weak cowards sit up there on television and tell you they're lying to your family, and tell you they're gonna break your bank, and bring you under their filthy control, and put you in their government housing pens to run your life, and bring you down, and imprison your children, and you submit to it with pleasure.
[00:44:20.292 --> 00:44:21.133]  Well, not me!
[00:44:21.573 --> 00:44:21.793]  Ever!
[00:44:23.456 --> 00:44:39.324]  Now let's go back to this clip of the loving little, little trendy, giggling and snickering with a group of academics about lying to everyone and how powerful it is to lie, how good they are.
[00:44:39.344 --> 00:44:41.125]  Oh yes, here it is.
[00:44:41.145 --> 00:44:43.506]  It's just, you can't do it, politically.
[00:44:43.526 --> 00:44:44.687]  You just literally cannot do it.
[00:44:45.107 --> 00:44:45.327]  Okay?
[00:44:45.627 --> 00:44:48.949]  Transparent financing, and let's not just transparent financing, also transparent spending.
[00:44:49.449 --> 00:44:55.391]  I mean, this bill was written in a tortured way to make sure CBO did not score the mandate as taxes.
[00:44:56.032 --> 00:44:57.952]  If CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies.
[00:44:58.713 --> 00:44:58.953]  Okay?
[00:44:59.213 --> 00:45:00.093]  So it was written to do that.
[00:45:00.613 --> 00:45:09.177]  In terms of risk-rated subsidies, if you had a law which said healthy people are going to pay in, it made explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed.
[00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:12.591]  So, lie to get something because you're the good guys, and that's a lie too.
[00:45:40.216 --> 00:45:41.617]  We have Phyllis Schlafly coming up.
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:46.861]  Here is the headline.
[00:45:52.286 --> 00:46:01.653]  Obama says FCC should reclassify Internet as a utility protected and run like water by the government.
[00:46:01.954 --> 00:46:03.135]  Oh yes!
[00:46:03.915 --> 00:46:06.597]  And then they subdivide it and sell it off to special interest and
[00:46:07.711 --> 00:46:12.652]  The inventor of the Internet, no it's not Al Gore, he's over in England, and others have said this plan worldwide is being pushed.
[00:46:13.132 --> 00:46:21.315]  They're trying to line it up right now with the Asian Pacific Partnership that cedes control to select corporations that then operate through government.
[00:46:22.035 --> 00:46:24.656]  That treaty's secret, but it got leaked last year as you know.
[00:46:25.156 --> 00:46:29.577]  President Obama has come out in support of reclassifying Internet service as a utility.
[00:46:30.976 --> 00:46:41.167]  A move that would allow the Federal Communications Commission to enforce more robust regulations and protect net neutrality.
[00:46:41.848 --> 00:46:42.949]  Do you really believe that?
[00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:45.592]  Robust regulations.
[00:46:45.652 --> 00:46:50.957]  To put these protections in place, I'm asking the FCC to reclassify Internet Service under Title II of the new law.
[00:46:51.878 --> 00:46:52.298]  We're good to go.
[00:47:23.039 --> 00:47:26.762]  That the White House officials have said they want to shut down, basically.
[00:47:30.765 --> 00:47:31.546]  So, this is it.
[00:47:31.626 --> 00:47:32.066]  They're coming.
[00:47:32.987 --> 00:47:34.268]  Drums, drums, drums of the deep.
[00:47:41.534 --> 00:47:43.875]  They're moving on every front, but you know why they're moving on every front?
[00:47:43.916 --> 00:47:47.779]  Because what they're doing is horrible and evil, and it's failing on many fronts.
[00:47:48.604 --> 00:47:52.166]  And so they've got to have their little snakes come out and go, yeah, we lie.
[00:47:52.507 --> 00:47:53.667]  There are death panels.
[00:47:54.048 --> 00:47:57.430]  I could play Bill Gates saying, yeah, we're going to kill an old lady to give you 10 jobs.
[00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:59.531]  And the teachers are, some of them are kind of smiling.
[00:47:59.551 --> 00:48:00.672]  They're like, ooh.
[00:48:01.693 --> 00:48:02.773]  But others are going, huh?
[00:48:02.793 --> 00:48:06.156]  Because they understand, oh, yeah, we're going to kill somebody to give you a job.
[00:48:06.176 --> 00:48:06.656]  Yeah, right.
[00:48:07.076 --> 00:48:09.018]  You make jobs by taking care of people.
[00:48:09.238 --> 00:48:10.999]  You make jobs by caring about everybody.
[00:48:11.619 --> 00:48:13.681]  The economy is just people dealing with each other.
[00:48:14.401 --> 00:48:18.323]  And having industry, not regulated and run by central government.
[00:48:18.904 --> 00:48:24.167]  They want to, it's just, it's so incredible to have Hillary come out and say, businesses don't hire people.
[00:48:24.207 --> 00:48:25.448]  Everybody knows it's government.
[00:48:27.209 --> 00:48:28.950]  And she couldn't even look at the crowd when she said it.
[00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:34.153]  She was just looking down because the psych warfare chiefs have told them, overthrow reality.
[00:48:34.914 --> 00:48:37.395]  The voters are dumbed down, but they know we're lying now.
[00:48:37.695 --> 00:48:43.659]  So be so bold that you just psychologically inoculate them to cuckoo bird behavior.
[00:48:45.083 --> 00:48:46.303]  And I mean, I've read their psyops.
[00:48:47.144 --> 00:48:47.684]  They're public.
[00:48:49.564 --> 00:48:51.565]  Just like they're publicly saying they're lying to you.
[00:48:53.485 --> 00:49:02.708]  What do you do when it comes out that they've got tens of thousands of veterans who won't get leg surgery, won't get heart surgery, won't get brain surgery, won't get skin cancer removed?
[00:49:03.448 --> 00:49:04.649]  They go and they say, here's some pills.
[00:49:06.369 --> 00:49:08.370]  And they're in a database to not give them care.
[00:49:09.229 --> 00:49:11.170]  Because they've decided you don't have a quality of life.
[00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:12.311]  They've decided you're dangerous.
[00:49:12.651 --> 00:49:14.493]  You're a weapon that's obsolete.
[00:49:14.513 --> 00:49:16.414]  They're moving on to drones and robots now.
[00:49:16.714 --> 00:49:19.016]  And they don't want old weapons left laying around.
[00:49:19.356 --> 00:49:20.617]  And you're being murdered!
[00:49:21.297 --> 00:49:24.239]  And you're going to be hunted down when all this comes down.
[00:49:24.499 --> 00:49:32.325]  You're officially the enemy with the younger soldiers and the younger police that are being trained to hunt you down.
[00:49:33.916 --> 00:49:40.039]  This is just a high-tech version of what the Soviets and the Nazis and the Chinese Communists and Fidel Castro and every other nutball did.
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:44.861]  Do you think they like the men that bring them to power?
[00:49:44.881 --> 00:49:46.342]  Do you think Hitler did?
[00:49:46.362 --> 00:49:50.363]  Do you think they like having you around these little cowardly people?
[00:49:51.804 --> 00:49:52.504]  They hate you.
[00:49:53.665 --> 00:49:55.546]  They want total control because they don't like wealth.
[00:49:55.746 --> 00:49:56.546]  They don't like power.
[00:49:56.686 --> 00:49:57.627]  They don't like success.
[00:49:58.067 --> 00:50:02.789]  Do you think they like strong, hardcore men who've killed a bunch of people?
[00:50:04.011 --> 00:50:06.291]  You think they actually like the real instrument?
[00:50:06.772 --> 00:50:07.832]  They fear you!
[00:50:08.072 --> 00:50:09.192]  They hate you!
[00:50:09.472 --> 00:50:10.212]  They shake!
[00:50:10.952 --> 00:50:12.653]  They're going to destroy you!
[00:50:13.093 --> 00:50:19.854]  So you go ahead and you serve them, and you sell your family out, and you sell your name out, and you sell your soul out!
[00:50:20.254 --> 00:50:21.735]  Because I guess they are God!
[00:50:22.055 --> 00:50:28.716]  Little, weak professors, on television, admitting they screwed everybody to rape America!
[00:50:31.468 --> 00:50:32.631]  Is that really who we are?
[00:50:32.651 --> 00:50:34.675]  Is that really what we've become?
[00:50:35.177 --> 00:50:38.023]  To bow to a bunch of lying scum in suits.
[00:50:39.735 --> 00:50:41.116]  Because I'm telling you, that's what it is.
[00:50:41.996 --> 00:50:47.238]  All you gotta do is wake up and get angry and start making moves against them politically in different ways and spreading the word.
[00:50:47.258 --> 00:50:59.422]  And having moral authority on your side, when they giggle and snap and laugh at you like the city officials do here when we bring up fluoride in the water or roadless, you know, warrantless checkpoints taking blood.
[00:50:59.722 --> 00:51:03.164]  They giggle and laugh like you don't have power because they're totally scared.
[00:51:03.344 --> 00:51:05.344]  It's a confidence game like with a lion.
[00:51:05.805 --> 00:51:06.905]  The lion tamers have to act
[00:51:07.005 --> 00:51:07.806]  I'm totally confident.
[00:51:08.086 --> 00:51:08.907]  Beat that lion.
[00:51:09.187 --> 00:51:10.308]  Keep it under submission.
[00:51:10.628 --> 00:51:11.148]  Dominate it.
[00:51:11.308 --> 00:51:17.774]  Because if you ever want to show fear, one time, when your head's in its mouth, snap like a bear trap on your head.
[00:51:18.354 --> 00:51:26.481]  And you've got this little pot-bellied lion tamer with their little whip, and we're this giant, 70 trillion pound lion, just, ahhh!
[00:51:26.541 --> 00:51:27.241]  Human liberty!
[00:51:27.441 --> 00:51:27.962]  Freedom!
[00:51:27.982 --> 00:51:28.442]  Honor!
[00:51:28.542 --> 00:51:28.983]  Everything!
[00:51:29.123 --> 00:51:32.626]  And they've got this little whip with us bowing to them as they beat us on the head!
[00:51:33.447 --> 00:51:34.187]  I'm sick of it!
[00:51:34.828 --> 00:51:35.468]  I'm tired of it!
[00:51:35.628 --> 00:51:36.629]  And I'm not afraid of them!
[00:51:37.409 --> 00:51:47.174]  These people will hold our species back, they will screw everything that our ancestors fought and died to survive through hell to pass on a baton to us to have a future.
[00:51:47.794 --> 00:51:53.457]  And I'm telling you from the foundations of the earth, these people were not meant to succeed and dominate greater men and women.
[00:51:54.117 --> 00:52:01.381]  So I'm here to beg God to give me the strength and the words to unlock the spirit of humanity
[00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:07.413]  With a huge awakening to bring these people down forever.
[00:52:07.493 --> 00:52:09.274]  And to bind them for hell.
[00:52:09.775 --> 00:52:12.357]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.

[00:53:11.079 --> 00:53:13.441]  You must be gone on vacation for a while.
[00:53:13.681 --> 00:53:14.922]  Thanks for all the jewelry.
[00:53:15.542 --> 00:53:17.584]  Don't be the next victim of a break-in.
[00:53:17.644 --> 00:53:26.090]  Go to FakeTV.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone is inside watching TV and makes your home unappealing to would-be thieves.

[00:53:27.691 --> 00:53:30.533]  Starting at $24.95 and there's free shipping.
[00:53:30.793 --> 00:53:35.397]  Go to Faketv.com or ask for it at your local hardware store.
[00:53:35.757 --> 00:53:37.919]  Faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[00:53:38.559 --> 00:53:44.123]  This winter, next to water and food, you need a safe, storable fuel supply for your preparedness needs.
[00:53:44.403 --> 00:53:46.025]  Spare fuel is the answer.
[00:53:46.345 --> 00:53:54.331]  Unlike gasoline, spare fuel can be safely stored with your other supplies for many years and works in any gas-powered vehicle or backup generator.
[00:53:54.651 --> 00:54:00.118]  With the bitterly cold temperatures predicted for this winter, now is the best time to stock up on spare fuel.
[00:54:00.358 --> 00:54:02.761]  So, go to GetSpareFuel.com.

[00:54:16.357 --> 00:54:19.642]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[00:54:19.942 --> 00:54:26.051]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way, while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[00:54:26.331 --> 00:54:28.652]  Don't depend on the government to save you.

[00:54:56.022 --> 00:55:00.406]  Before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.

[00:55:12.481 --> 00:55:16.465]  Well, bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, Obamacare is now moving to the internet.
[00:55:16.845 --> 00:55:24.371]  Federal regulation and control written for select corporations right out of the FCC to shut down all their competition.
[00:55:24.892 --> 00:55:33.759]  And Republican leaders, to their credit, have now come out with statements that will cover some of Phyllis Schlafly in the next hour saying that
[00:55:34.989 --> 00:55:36.810]  It is Obamacare for the Internet.
[00:55:37.231 --> 00:55:38.752]  That's what Ted Cruz has come out and said.
[00:55:38.772 --> 00:55:39.993]  It's why I like Ted Cruz.
[00:55:40.013 --> 00:55:40.834]  He knows what he's talking about.
[00:55:41.334 --> 00:55:42.595]  We told you this a long time ago.
[00:55:42.655 --> 00:55:44.056]  It's how they control major governments.
[00:55:44.596 --> 00:55:52.963]  Ex-MI6 chief Peter Heyman named as VIP who sexually abused boys at Dolphin Square apartment complex near Parliament.
[00:55:54.531 --> 00:55:59.812]  And that's how they blackmail folks, is they'll only put pedophiles, especially in England, in the highest positions.
[00:56:00.652 --> 00:56:04.273]  Heyman was a member of the Pedophile Information Exchange.
[00:56:05.233 --> 00:56:18.676]  The former deputy director of MI6, Peter Heyman, sexually abused young boys at an apartment complex for Parliament, an alleged victim, has claimed Heyman died in 92, was investigated by police in 78 for possessing inappropriate literature, but was not prosecuted.
[00:56:20.737 --> 00:56:26.861]  Remember, Savelle was hanging out with the Royal Family and was found with secret rooms and molested hundreds of people.
[00:56:27.181 --> 00:56:30.983]  But it's a lot, and again, David Icke spoke about him a decade before it came out.
[00:56:31.004 --> 00:56:36.207]  That's the thing about David Icke, so much of that stuff he said, I would like delay him on air a few times, like 10 years ago.
[00:56:36.667 --> 00:56:37.868]  I would say, hit the delay.
[00:56:39.688 --> 00:56:43.151]  And we would hit the delay when he would say some stuff because I didn't even want it on air.
[00:56:43.211 --> 00:56:47.994]  I was like, how could he be naming former prime ministers and people and stuff slitting children's throats?
[00:56:48.034 --> 00:56:50.516]  And then it just more and more of it starts to come out.
[00:56:50.556 --> 00:56:51.917]  It's very scary stuff, folks.
[00:56:52.538 --> 00:56:53.498]  Very scary stuff.
[00:56:57.682 --> 00:56:58.742]  I got really mad earlier.
[00:56:58.762 --> 00:57:03.366]  Instead of just yelling and screaming, I got in my controlled rage mode.
[00:57:05.513 --> 00:57:06.774]  People say, man, that guy's radical.
[00:57:06.834 --> 00:57:07.094]  Really?
[00:57:07.535 --> 00:57:14.160]  We're in this predicament because people think being screwed and robbed and laughed at publicly is not something to get upset about.
[00:57:15.781 --> 00:57:21.786]  Imagine if I walked to your house every month and at gunpoint demanded, you know, hundreds of dollars more out of your wallet.
[00:57:22.907 --> 00:57:24.488]  You would fight me.
[00:57:24.928 --> 00:57:25.449]  And you should.
[00:57:25.809 --> 00:57:32.114]  But foreign banks took over the government and wrote Obamacare to rob you and your family.
[00:57:36.297 --> 00:57:37.378]  It's just no big deal.
[00:57:38.419 --> 00:57:45.163]  They just don't care that people just think it's your job to be broken and raped by these people.
[00:57:46.504 --> 00:57:48.325]  And I'm not talking about our audience in general.
[00:57:48.446 --> 00:57:50.527]  I'm talking about the general public is in a trance.
[00:57:50.567 --> 00:57:53.569]  They know they're being lied to, they know they're being cheated, but they don't believe they can change it.
[00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:55.631]  They're totally passive like spectators.
[00:57:55.911 --> 00:58:01.535]  We have to get out of that mode and get into what Thomas Jefferson talked about, the animating contest of liberty.
[00:58:01.555 --> 00:58:02.936]  So that's all coming up in the next hour.
[00:58:04.704 --> 00:58:07.425]  Condoleezza Rice says the world isn't listening to us because of Obama.
[00:58:09.065 --> 00:58:16.467]  Police Department wish list included which assets to steal and seize and what they're looking for, New York Times.
[00:58:17.207 --> 00:58:18.547]  Just total corruption coming in.
[00:58:18.987 --> 00:58:21.888]  Winston Churchill had a bid with a U.S.
[00:58:21.948 --> 00:58:26.229]  Senator and President to nuke Russia during the Cold War, FBI file show.
[00:58:26.729 --> 00:58:29.450]  He pretty much gave speeches saying that, but yeah, that's well known.
[00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:33.911]  Rush Limbaugh threatens to sue Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
[00:58:35.106 --> 00:58:38.430]  Employment situation improves in October, except for African Americans.
[00:58:41.293 --> 00:58:43.375]  That's just some of what we're going to be covering in the next hour.
[00:58:44.016 --> 00:58:56.429]  Briefly, I don't like to have to tell you this, but we did not budget in enough money to produce enough product for Infowarslife.com, and then it takes
[00:58:57.481 --> 00:59:02.808]  Upwards of 12 weeks to make some of the products, to source it, to go through all the testing, to get all the certifications.
[00:59:03.289 --> 00:59:06.073]  We follow the absolute letter of the law and regulations.
[00:59:06.153 --> 00:59:06.794]  Most people don't.
[00:59:06.834 --> 00:59:10.519]  We jump through every hoop, have lawyers that look at it, top lawyers, you name it.
[00:59:11.755 --> 00:59:12.715]  We're running out of everything.
[00:59:13.336 --> 00:59:15.217]  You know, we've been sold out of Occupower for months.
[00:59:15.257 --> 00:59:16.497]  We're sold out of Silver Bullet.
[00:59:16.977 --> 00:59:19.519]  We're almost sold out of Super Mel Vitality, Super Female Vitality.
[00:59:19.539 --> 00:59:20.739]  We're almost sold out of DNA Force.
[00:59:21.039 --> 00:59:23.881]  We're almost sold out of Survival Shield X2, Iodine.
[00:59:24.901 --> 00:59:30.184]  We are basically sold out of Occupowder, but 2,000 more bottles comes tomorrow.
[00:59:31.357 --> 00:59:36.818]  Basically, if you want to get any of the products the way things are going, you need to get them now.
[00:59:37.399 --> 00:59:40.039]  The biodefense pack, that's about to sell out.
[00:59:40.459 --> 00:59:41.600]  All of it's about to sell out.
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:44.280]  The highest quality supplements out there, just amazing.

[01:00:11.855 --> 01:00:18.617]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[01:00:57.238 --> 01:00:58.038]  Others don't.
[01:01:01.541 --> 01:01:04.128]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:01:15.475 --> 01:01:19.661]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:01:20.322 --> 01:01:21.123]  You want answers?
[01:01:21.904 --> 01:01:22.806]  Well, so does he.
[01:01:23.446 --> 01:01:27.112]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:01:27.653 --> 01:01:31.698]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:01:34.361 --> 01:01:37.562]  Bella Shafley of the Eagle Forum.
[01:01:37.582 --> 01:01:39.803]  50 years since she published her book, A Choice on an Echo.
[01:01:40.383 --> 01:01:43.144]  She's going to be talking 2016 and beyond.
[01:01:43.245 --> 01:01:44.785]  What 2014 election meant.
[01:01:45.986 --> 01:01:48.327]  Obama calling to have Obamacare for the internet.
[01:01:48.387 --> 01:01:49.807]  Total FCC takeover.
[01:01:51.608 --> 01:01:54.069]  It's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen, today.
[01:01:54.089 --> 01:01:57.170]  We're going to have open phones in the third hour.
[01:01:59.511 --> 01:02:01.972]  But I got beside myself in the last hour.
[01:02:05.609 --> 01:02:19.035]  When I played that clip of one of the main Obamacare architects, Jonathan Gruber, admitting that, quote, lack of transparency was key to getting the Affordable Care Act passed because the stupidity of the American voter.
[01:02:25.619 --> 01:02:26.279]  Just amazing.
[01:02:30.066 --> 01:02:35.090]  And I know Paul wrote that article, but it is a good job, but the way the quote goes, I don't think it's explanatory.
[01:02:35.110 --> 01:02:51.682]  It says, in a newly uncovered video, Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber admits that a lack of transparency was key to getting the Affordable Care Act passed because the stupidity of the American voter was key or otherwise the bill would have been killed.
[01:02:52.223 --> 01:02:54.024]  Because it said would have otherwise been killed.
[01:02:56.321 --> 01:02:59.562]  No, the stupidity, intelligence would have killed the bill.
[01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:01.303]  Stupidity is what helped it pass.
[01:03:01.883 --> 01:03:04.584]  So, get a hold of Paul or have them look at that.
[01:03:04.664 --> 01:03:05.085]  No big deal.
[01:03:05.105 --> 01:03:07.406]  I just don't have time during the breaks to do this stuff.
[01:03:07.446 --> 01:03:08.346]  I just do it on air, folks.
[01:03:08.886 --> 01:03:10.247]  And I get corrected by them sometimes.
[01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:13.368]  I get dates wrong or things wrong and they correct me and we all work together.
[01:03:14.128 --> 01:03:15.449]  And that's what we're trying to do here.
[01:03:15.489 --> 01:03:20.611]  But that article is up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com with the video.
[01:03:25.854 --> 01:03:29.656]  My personal trainer trained me a few times a week, just texted me, he said, you have some good energy on the show today.
[01:03:30.336 --> 01:03:31.476]  Yeah, anger will do that.
[01:03:31.536 --> 01:03:45.402]  I mean, watching that twit set up there and talk about how he's, you know, lying to everybody and how funny it is with a bunch of academics, you know, learning the power of lying, the power of being dishonorable, the power of screwing people over for the greater good.
[01:03:46.682 --> 01:03:50.744]  Totally and completely, massively
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.261]  Disgusting on every front.
[01:03:53.842 --> 01:03:56.965]  And basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever.
[01:03:56.985 --> 01:04:02.010]  Yeah, let's play the full clip in context for them.
[01:04:03.131 --> 01:04:03.692]  Here he is.
[01:04:05.290 --> 01:04:19.196]  The Economist, working as an advisor to Obama, talking about keeping it from the public that it was a tax, keeping it from the public that you'd have to pay a lot more, having Obama go out and go, look, I'll tell you straight up, it'll cut your prices down to the cost of a phone bill or cable bill.
[01:04:19.496 --> 01:04:23.418]  You'll keep your doctor, and I can tell you again, don't listen to the lies of these right-wing racists!
[01:04:23.438 --> 01:04:26.059]  And we're like, hey, the bill says it right here.
[01:04:26.299 --> 01:04:27.100]  Shut up, racists!
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:29.641]  Everybody would yell, oh, racists!
[01:04:30.121 --> 01:04:34.243]  Now, this is all known, and we can't even get it repealed.
[01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:41.227]  Because of the self-propelled zombie, Mitch McConnell, when he talks, he's like, but we're a good deal.
[01:04:41.247 --> 01:04:44.671]  Well, I can't say we'd get rid of all of them, but we'll get rid of some of it.
[01:04:44.692 --> 01:04:47.715]  It's like one of those ventriloquist dolls or something.
[01:04:48.697 --> 01:04:50.799]  He's got like an Obama tentacle up his patootie ears.
[01:04:50.959 --> 01:04:53.021]  I mean, I don't know what's going on, but let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[01:04:53.341 --> 01:04:55.303]  It's just, you can't do it, politically.
[01:04:55.343 --> 01:04:56.504]  You just literally cannot do it.
[01:04:56.924 --> 01:05:00.788]  Okay, transparent financing, and let's not just transparent financing, also transparent spending.
[01:05:01.248 --> 01:05:07.213]  I mean, this bill was written in a tortured way to make sure CBO did not score the mandate as taxes.
[01:05:07.854 --> 01:05:09.735]  If CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies.
[01:05:10.518 --> 01:05:12.760]  Okay, so it's written to do that.
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:20.988]  In terms of risk-rated subsidies, if you get a law which said healthy people are going to pay in, it made explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed.
[01:05:21.658 --> 01:05:27.100]  Okay, just like people, lack of transparency is a huge political advantage.
[01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:30.862]  And basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever.
[01:05:31.382 --> 01:05:35.904]  But basically, that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass.
[01:05:36.044 --> 01:05:40.145]  I wonder how he'd like it if somebody came up and mugged him.
[01:05:41.506 --> 01:05:44.367]  And he said, hey, you're robbing me, you're being deceptive.
[01:05:45.348 --> 01:05:49.409]  Or how would he feel if somebody sold him stocks or bonds that were worthless and conned him?
[01:05:49.429 --> 01:05:50.870]  And he'd be like, hey, I lied to you.
[01:05:51.806 --> 01:06:02.129]  But it makes me trendy and really smart and I'm wearing a suit and I'm on TV with a bunch of other academics talking about how deceiving people about cost and that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[01:06:02.389 --> 01:06:07.791]  The death panels, taking control of the doctors, I mean it's just these people are an abomination.
[01:06:09.790 --> 01:06:13.292]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:06:13.452 --> 01:06:17.415]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:06:17.735 --> 01:06:19.196]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:06:19.516 --> 01:06:27.100]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:28.221]  But for how long?

[01:06:30.722 --> 01:06:34.785]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:06:35.145 --> 01:06:36.326]  Infidel Body Armor.

[01:07:10.901 --> 01:07:13.442]  When cells become toxic, they die early.
[01:07:13.682 --> 01:07:14.683]  An agent sets in.
[01:07:15.443 --> 01:07:19.766]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[01:07:19.906 --> 01:07:26.689]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:36.274]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:07:36.494 --> 01:07:41.936]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.

[01:08:21.353 --> 01:08:28.422]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[01:08:28.422 --> 01:08:29.123]  We're good to go.
[01:08:49.264 --> 01:08:59.051]  That all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com and believed in us and tried the products.
[01:08:59.392 --> 01:09:07.038]  Folks, check out Infowarslife.com today and the entire line of groundbreaking, cutting-edge, hardcore products.
[01:09:11.901 --> 01:09:14.083]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:09:14.663 --> 01:09:17.465]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:09:39.279 --> 01:09:44.004]  Well, I could not think of a better time to have Phyllis Schlafly on the broadcast.
[01:09:44.024 --> 01:09:48.308]  I've been interviewing her for, it's gotta be 19 years, I've been on air 20.
[01:09:49.048 --> 01:09:53.953]  She works tirelessly, even back at the time when I was only on one FM station here in Austin.
[01:09:54.734 --> 01:09:58.177]  She would come on the broadcast a few times a year to promote the ideas of liberty.
[01:09:59.518 --> 01:10:01.400]  And it was 50 years ago this year,
[01:10:03.226 --> 01:10:09.734]  That she published her best-selling book, A Choice, Not an Echo, and that's being republished now.
[01:10:10.535 --> 01:10:16.402]  We'll give you the details of that information, but Phyllis Schlafly.com, EagleForum.org.
[01:10:16.442 --> 01:10:18.725]  You can also find some of her work at WND.com.
[01:10:21.144 --> 01:10:26.748]  She's been a national leader of the conservative movement since the publication of her best-selling book, A Choice Not An Echo.
[01:10:27.209 --> 01:10:30.391]  She's a constitutional lawyer and a lot more.
[01:10:30.471 --> 01:10:32.133]  I'm not going to try to get into...
[01:10:34.207 --> 01:10:40.732]  Everything that she's been involved in, but she served as a member of the Commission on the Bicentennial of the U.S.
[01:10:40.752 --> 01:10:43.355]  Constitution, appointed by President Reagan.
[01:10:43.395 --> 01:10:50.000]  She has testified before more than 50 congressional and state legislative committees on constitutional, national defense, and family issues.
[01:10:52.662 --> 01:10:57.705]  Someone like Ron Paul, you could say, is the kind of father of the libertarian constitutional movement.
[01:10:58.005 --> 01:11:04.248]  Phyllis Schlafly is like the mother of the constitutionalist liberty movement.
[01:11:04.908 --> 01:11:06.809]  And we would be in deep trouble without her.
[01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:12.933]  If you read her work going back over 55 years, almost all of it has turned out to be extremely accurate.
[01:11:13.533 --> 01:11:16.514]  And she's got a syndicated column as well, the Phyllis Schlafly Report.
[01:11:16.954 --> 01:11:18.495]  That's in over 100 newspapers.
[01:11:19.315 --> 01:11:22.736]  She's got her daily radio commentaries on over 600 stations.
[01:11:24.117 --> 01:11:26.698]  And she's got Eagle Forum live on over 90 stations.
[01:11:27.298 --> 01:11:32.260]  And also heard over the internet, so be sure and go to phyllislafly.com, eagleforum.org.
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:33.500]  She understands.
[01:11:34.701 --> 01:11:36.701]  Like Charlton Heston did and so many others.
[01:11:36.761 --> 01:11:38.102]  This is a full-on war.
[01:11:39.181 --> 01:11:40.882]  And I'll play the clip later for her.
[01:11:41.202 --> 01:11:42.683]  I discussed it a lot in the last hour.
[01:11:43.083 --> 01:11:48.105]  I played the clip of Ezekiel Emanuel last year admitting they want to wreck health care in America, basically cloward and piven.
[01:11:48.785 --> 01:11:50.086]  That's the socialist plan.
[01:11:50.666 --> 01:12:06.954]  But the new clip of one of the chief architects, Jonathan Gruber, heading up Obama's economic commission advising on Obamacare, saying that they lie to the public with lack of transparency being key to fooling stupid Americans.
[01:12:07.873 --> 01:12:08.874]  And stupid voters.
[01:12:09.834 --> 01:12:12.916]  And he was there teaching other academic media how to lie.
[01:12:12.936 --> 01:12:28.226]  It's just simply incredible that they say they have the moral high ground, everything they do wrecks things but gives them more power, and then they admit that they lie and deceive and cheat and death panels now, Bill Gates admits that.
[01:12:29.467 --> 01:12:32.549]  I want to say that low-level leftists mean well.
[01:12:33.915 --> 01:12:34.835]  Or want a free lunch.
[01:12:34.895 --> 01:12:35.336]  It varies.
[01:12:36.016 --> 01:12:37.857]  But at the top, these are not leftists.
[01:12:38.737 --> 01:12:44.659]  These are deranged control freaks, more akin to what you saw in the French Revolution.
[01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:51.642]  The only behavior I've seen like this is in the French Revolution, if you study the degeneracy of the Jacobins and others.
[01:12:51.962 --> 01:12:53.443]  I don't want to go into a history lesson here.
[01:12:53.463 --> 01:12:54.824]  Phyllis Schlafly joins us.
[01:12:55.124 --> 01:12:55.904]  Thank you so much.
[01:12:55.964 --> 01:13:00.246]  I know you want to get into 2014 elections, what you think that really signified.
[01:13:00.746 --> 01:13:03.127]  The landscape, is it a big political realignment?
[01:13:03.247 --> 01:13:04.227]  I certainly think so.
[01:13:05.207 --> 01:13:10.369]  Can we defeat the establishment Republicans that will try to play ball with the same crony capitalist?
[01:13:10.809 --> 01:13:14.830]  Looking forward to 2016, what do you see in your crystal ball?
[01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:22.952]  We'll discuss it all today in the republishing of your book, Phyllis, but first off, we commend your 55 years of work for liberty.
[01:13:24.133 --> 01:13:32.858]  And we'd like to get your take on my little rant discussing the arrogance that we're seeing out of the so-called left right now.
[01:13:33.139 --> 01:13:36.200]  How would you characterize the mental state of these people?
[01:13:37.021 --> 01:13:39.562]  Well, thank you for all the kind words you said, Alex.
[01:13:39.682 --> 01:13:40.863]  It's good to be on with you.
[01:13:41.724 --> 01:13:42.984]  And you are right.
[01:13:43.665 --> 01:13:45.326]  They deserve a rant because they
[01:13:45.902 --> 01:13:53.847]  They have really brought this country down the wrong path and the majority of Americans admitted we're going in the wrong way.
[01:13:54.568 --> 01:13:58.230]  And I think what they really want is power and money, our money.
[01:13:59.030 --> 01:14:05.655]  And they want to make sure that the government has control and makes the decisions for us.
[01:14:06.175 --> 01:14:12.459]  When I grew up, I guess it was years before you grew up, but we had a country of middle-class families.
[01:14:13.123 --> 01:14:15.804]  Who had intact nuclear families.
[01:14:15.844 --> 01:14:21.926]  That is, the mother and father were married to each other and raising their own children in one household.
[01:14:22.846 --> 01:14:27.228]  And now, that's just the minority of people in our country.
[01:14:28.028 --> 01:14:32.609]  But the nuclear family was the self-contained economic unit.
[01:14:32.649 --> 01:14:37.111]  They spent their own money, made their own decisions, decided how they were going to raise their children.
[01:14:37.951 --> 01:14:40.632]  And now we don't have that anymore, and you find
[01:14:42.476 --> 01:14:47.619]  The liberals who want to give us government control of everything.
[01:14:47.639 --> 01:15:02.325]  You know, the speech that Obama made up in Rhode Island a couple of weeks ago, which he said, we just shouldn't allow women to have the choice, choice, he used the word choice, of taking care of their own children or being in the workforce.
[01:15:03.025 --> 01:15:09.368]  Because we want them to be in the workforce so they pay more taxes so we can provide them with government childcare and raise their children.
[01:15:11.804 --> 01:15:17.487]  And so first they sell the idea that a woman's not worthy if she doesn't have some job paying all these taxes.
[01:15:18.067 --> 01:15:22.189]  And great, if a woman wants a career, go be a constitutional lawyer, change the world like you've done, more power to them.
[01:15:22.649 --> 01:15:24.730]  If a man wants to stay home with the kids, more power to him.
[01:15:24.810 --> 01:15:28.112]  Or wants to go out and, you know, work at a factory or build a factory.
[01:15:28.312 --> 01:15:29.332]  I mean, that's free will.
[01:15:29.712 --> 01:15:35.055]  But the demonization of a maternal role and then now saying,
[01:15:36.164 --> 01:15:37.505]  Women just shouldn't have the choice.
[01:15:37.965 --> 01:15:43.128]  They should be made to go out into the system and let the state raise the children.
[01:15:43.488 --> 01:15:46.789]  That's what MSNBC has been saying in promos now for two years.
[01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:51.372]  Every week promos, they're saying, your kids belong to the state.
[01:15:51.872 --> 01:15:53.773]  They're really coming out of the closet, aren't they?
[01:15:54.133 --> 01:15:55.154]  They certainly are.
[01:15:55.174 --> 01:16:00.136]  And of course, when you go in the workforce, you're going to pay taxes.
[01:16:00.516 --> 01:16:05.679]  And that's going to give these bureaucrats more of your money to spend and tell you how to spend it.
[01:16:06.277 --> 01:16:13.425]  Here's Melissa Harris Perry in an MSNBC promo saying that we gotta get past the idea that your kids belong to you.
[01:16:13.865 --> 01:16:21.774]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:16:22.154 --> 01:16:27.140]  Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households, then we start making better investments.
[01:16:28.618 --> 01:16:31.500]  Well, that's real straight-to-left-wing heresy, yes.
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:33.761]  It's just absolutely wrong.
[01:16:34.682 --> 01:16:38.704]  Everything we know means children do better when they're raised by their own parents.
[01:16:39.064 --> 01:16:48.890]  In fact, you know, we poured all this money into public schools in an attempt to close the gap, those are the magic words, between the high-achieving and the low-achieving students.
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:52.642]  And they used to think the real cause of the gap was poverty.
[01:16:53.163 --> 01:16:56.064]  And now recent research shows it's really not poverty.
[01:16:56.465 --> 01:16:59.727]  It's whether or not the kids are raised by their own mother and father.
[01:17:00.347 --> 01:17:02.849]  And those who are, are going to do better in school.
[01:17:03.226 --> 01:17:08.990]  And of course they knew that in the social engineering, and that's why they've worked as hard as they can to break up the family.
[01:17:09.310 --> 01:17:10.991]  They know full well what they're doing.
[01:17:11.051 --> 01:17:11.972]  It's premeditated.
[01:17:12.512 --> 01:17:21.959]  What do you make of more and more Democrats and leftists coming out and admitting they lie, and admitting they deceive, and admitting they want to wreck the economy so they can be in control?
[01:17:22.739 --> 01:17:30.744]  I mean, for me, that is criminal fraud to have people involved in Obamacare coming out and saying, we lied to Congress, we lied to the public.
[01:17:31.985 --> 01:17:33.166]  I mean, that's just outrageous.
[01:17:33.346 --> 01:17:37.808]  Well, you know, this case that the Supreme Court has just taken, it's really pretty funny.
[01:17:38.228 --> 01:17:39.629]  It's about Obamacare.
[01:17:40.289 --> 01:17:48.934]  And when the Obamacare said that you only got the subsidies if your exchange was set up by the state.
[01:17:49.374 --> 01:17:50.474]  The words are very clear.
[01:17:50.494 --> 01:17:51.855]  They're not equivocal at all.
[01:17:52.655 --> 01:17:57.718]  And they want people to... But most of the states didn't sign up for it.
[01:17:58.510 --> 01:18:00.891]  And so the people want to get the subsidies anyway.
[01:18:01.392 --> 01:18:05.013]  And they're trying to get the Supreme Court to rewrite the legislation.
[01:18:05.694 --> 01:18:08.855]  Now, our Constitution says all legislative powers are in the Congress.
[01:18:08.895 --> 01:18:09.716]  It's very clear.
[01:18:09.736 --> 01:18:11.977]  There's nothing equivocal about it.
[01:18:12.817 --> 01:18:19.641]  And the Supreme Court is going to take that case, and the question is, are they going to stick to the way it was written, or are they going to rewrite it?
[01:18:20.728 --> 01:18:24.890]  Well, there's a real power struggle in American intelligency and the elites itself.
[01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:29.833]  For so long, the Republican bluebloods have worked with the left in this radical transformation.
[01:18:30.233 --> 01:18:40.478]  Now that we see that it's designed to wreck the country and fold us into global government, a lot of elites, who aren't completely criminal, are now trying to put the brakes on things.
[01:18:40.979 --> 01:18:44.580]  I know you have a lot of high-level contacts inside the system.
[01:18:45.161 --> 01:18:47.202]  Do you think that's an accurate statement that there is
[01:18:48.984 --> 01:18:56.517]  A serious re-looking at things inside of the establishment and that a lot of people are realizing that we better turn back now?
[01:18:57.003 --> 01:19:13.573]  Well, I don't see much evidence that it's the establishment, the big boys, the Chamber of Commerce types, who are rethinking it, because they like it when we bring in cheap labor so they can raise their stock price, their value can go up.
[01:19:14.654 --> 01:19:22.499]  But I think the American people are catching on, that most of the people who are coming in are willing to work for lower wages.
[01:19:23.263 --> 01:19:29.349]  And they were asking me to comment on these states that passed the minimum wage law the other day.
[01:19:29.369 --> 01:19:37.637]  But it's not the actual amount of the wage that is attracting them.
[01:19:37.717 --> 01:19:42.421]  These people who come in and are working are willing to work for much lower than the minimum wage.
[01:19:42.521 --> 01:19:45.364]  And they genuinely also get welfare on the side as a supplement?
[01:19:45.384 --> 01:19:46.365]  Yes, they certainly do.
[01:19:47.886 --> 01:19:48.387]  That's right.
[01:19:49.162 --> 01:20:04.929]  And so I think the American people are waking up, and the big question now is are we going to let Obama get by with his executive amnesty, which is he wants to bring in more cheap labor, and of course he's bringing in all these diseases.
[01:20:05.589 --> 01:20:16.674]  We've got children dying with this new kind of a TB disease that's being brought in by these unaccompanied minors who are coming in and trying to go into our schools.
[01:20:18.256 --> 01:20:22.857]  And our children are being sacrificed, regardless of what color, on the altar of globalism.
[01:20:22.897 --> 01:20:29.998]  That's why they couldn't control the borders or planes with Ebola, because they don't want to ever send the message that having a border might be something you might want to have.
[01:20:30.018 --> 01:20:31.298]  Fellow Schlafly, stay there.
[01:20:31.618 --> 01:20:34.819]  We're going to come back, and I want to get into 2014.
[01:20:34.899 --> 01:20:37.279]  How big of a wake-up was it?
[01:20:37.299 --> 01:20:39.500]  2016, Obama's executive power grab.
[01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:42.080]  Will the Republican establishment try to block it?
[01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:43.221]  But I want to agree with you.
[01:20:43.661 --> 01:20:45.501]  It's the grassroots that's waking up.
[01:20:46.778 --> 01:21:04.447]  Not even so much the elite, but I am seeing a lot of signs that there are a lot of people in the establishment that do see now that we're coming to the end of the road and that globalism is not really a good idea and so they may want to change sides basically right here at the end so they don't get the blame.
[01:21:04.828 --> 01:21:05.528]  We'll be right back.
[01:21:05.588 --> 01:21:06.589]  Stay with us.

[01:22:09.892 --> 01:22:14.977]  The lining of your lungs is supposed to be protected with glutathione to neutralize incoming irritants.
[01:22:15.258 --> 01:22:18.962]  In the absence of enough glutathione, your lungs are more prone to irritation.
[01:22:19.122 --> 01:22:24.247]  Listen to the real-world results of one man using a powerful glutathione-supporting food.
[01:22:24.267 --> 01:22:25.749]  Hi, my name is Bill O'Brien.
[01:22:26.169 --> 01:22:28.952]  I generally suffer through an asthmatic breathing type situation.
[01:22:29.633 --> 01:22:32.496]  My breathing is shallow and generally constricted in the nose and lungs.
[01:22:33.176 --> 01:22:38.399]  After consuming one world away today, I have tremendous energy and also notice my breathing is free.
[01:22:39.159 --> 01:22:46.163]  I can feel the air in my left nostril and it is free all the way to my abdomen, which is pretty remarkable because I rarely get that feeling.
[01:22:46.183 --> 01:22:48.404]  Being a singer, I love feeling this unrestricted voice.
[01:22:49.246 --> 01:22:52.467]  The only thing new I've actually added to my routine is One World Way.
[01:22:53.067 --> 01:22:53.267]  Wow!
[01:22:53.987 --> 01:22:54.328]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:22:54.368 --> 01:22:54.628]  That's 888-988-3325.

[01:22:56.168 --> 01:22:56.928]  That's One World.
[01:22:56.948 --> 01:22:57.168]  W-H-E-Y.com.
[01:23:08.644 --> 01:23:11.206]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:23:11.466 --> 01:23:16.349]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:23:16.589 --> 01:23:24.475]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:23:24.715 --> 01:23:29.018]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[01:23:29.238 --> 01:23:33.060]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:38.504]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hardworking American men
[01:23:38.564 --> 01:23:39.324]  I don't think so.
[01:24:08.115 --> 01:24:10.317]  What good is a Big Berkey water filter?
[01:24:38.355 --> 01:24:42.839]  At only 1.7 cents a gallon, a single set of filters can last for 5 to 10 years.
[01:24:43.199 --> 01:24:44.660]  That means big savings.
[01:24:44.981 --> 01:24:45.581]  Big Berkey.
[01:24:45.821 --> 01:24:49.144]  The one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[01:24:59.412 --> 01:25:00.233]  For the love of clean water.
[01:25:22.821 --> 01:25:24.202]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:24.242 --> 01:25:27.245]  Phyllis Schlafly is our guest today for the rest of the hour.
[01:25:27.385 --> 01:25:29.007]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:25:29.027 --> 01:25:31.769]  If you just joined us, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:25:31.789 --> 01:25:36.793]  So I want to just give her the floor right now to get into her view on 2014 election.
[01:25:36.833 --> 01:25:37.774]  What does it really mean?
[01:25:38.395 --> 01:25:40.997]  What does she see looking forward into 2016?
[01:25:41.638 --> 01:25:43.699]  What are the big issues?
[01:25:43.759 --> 01:25:44.040]  Phyllis?
[01:25:44.841 --> 01:25:55.889]  Well, a big issue in the 2014 election was the Republicans getting control of the Senate so they can stop Obama from putting any other judge on the Supreme Court.
[01:25:57.067 --> 01:26:02.871]  If he put one more justice on the Supreme Court, I think he would rule his country for the next 30 years.
[01:26:03.572 --> 01:26:19.302]  And I believe that the Republicans should make a decision that they are not going to confirm any more judges appointed by Obama, because he's already done quite an effective job of packing the federal court system with left-wing judges.
[01:26:19.382 --> 01:26:24.446]  Sure, shouldn't they block the people he wants for the Attorney General?
[01:26:24.726 --> 01:26:25.386]  Absolutely.
[01:26:25.726 --> 01:26:26.327]  Absolutely.
[01:26:27.885 --> 01:26:30.767]  They all have some fight in them.
[01:26:30.787 --> 01:26:34.008]  The people spoke, and they should carry out the wish of the people.
[01:26:34.688 --> 01:26:39.731]  Obama said his policies were all on the ballot, and okay, we'll accept that.
[01:26:40.251 --> 01:26:42.072]  They were, and the people rejected them.
[01:26:43.066 --> 01:26:47.211]  That's right, the Democrats and Obama said this was basically a referendum.
[01:26:47.231 --> 01:26:49.634]  It was a major political realignment.
[01:26:49.674 --> 01:26:53.138]  I mean, the Democrats haven't been this weak since 1920.
[01:26:53.258 --> 01:26:57.544]  I mean, this really is a sign that they're in trouble.
[01:26:58.465 --> 01:27:07.930]  It certainly is, and so it's a good omen for two years from now, and I hope that the Republicans can stay on the ball and be a fighter.
[01:27:08.150 --> 01:27:14.033]  Let's not have any of this talk about bipartisanship and trying to make a deal with them.
[01:27:14.354 --> 01:27:18.856]  Use our majority and restore some constitutional rules.
[01:27:19.630 --> 01:27:28.946]  The idea of letting Obama make new laws with executive amnesty and executive action is just unacceptable in a free country.
[01:27:29.355 --> 01:27:42.682]  What's going to happen if Boehner and McConnell ride herd on the good Republicans, there's a lot of good ones in there, and they don't repeal Obamacare, or they let Obama sign a bunch of executive orders?
[01:27:43.342 --> 01:27:44.403]  What's the word you're getting?
[01:27:44.443 --> 01:27:45.944]  Are they planning to slap him down?
[01:27:46.244 --> 01:27:47.744]  Because Obama seems belligerent.
[01:27:47.985 --> 01:27:49.145]  He says he's going forward.
[01:27:50.826 --> 01:27:58.210]  Yes he is, and he seems to think that he's some kind of a king who can do whatever he wants.
[01:27:58.757 --> 01:27:58.837]  Wow!
[01:28:29.409 --> 01:28:31.470]  You know, it doesn't make sense.
[01:28:31.791 --> 01:28:40.716]  And now one of the big issues that the Republicans are playing coy about is this new, uh, giving Obama fast track.
[01:28:41.334 --> 01:28:55.701]  Now that's giving him power that they never gave to Clinton or Bush or any of the previous presidents, which means they can go make a trade agreement in secret without consulting anybody, with bypassing Congress, and just make it.
[01:28:56.002 --> 01:29:02.505]  And it becomes a treaty with all the advantages and constitutional protection of a treaty.
[01:29:02.745 --> 01:29:10.810]  And of course, that's that Pacific Trade Partnership that's got 30 parts, only one part's been leaked, and it gives control of the internet over to the UN, basically.
[01:29:11.450 --> 01:29:20.175]  This is dictatorship by shadowy boards, and yeah, the Republicans are talking about handing that to him when he's just been given a mandate to do nothing.
[01:29:20.953 --> 01:29:22.293]  Well, we shouldn't let him do it.
[01:29:22.353 --> 01:29:31.116]  We should kick up a fuss, and I'm sorry, we've got to... Well, now listen, Alex, you know that the big fight is within the Republican Party.
[01:29:31.136 --> 01:29:31.436]  Oh, yes.
[01:29:31.596 --> 01:29:38.178]  It's between the establishment, the people who like to think they're the kingmakers of our land, and the grassroots.
[01:29:38.978 --> 01:29:49.541]  And that's why people need to read my new book, A Choice, Not an Echo, because that tells you about all the shady deals and shenanigans that they pulled in the past to give us this series of losers.
[01:29:50.103 --> 01:29:51.963]  We used to call them Me Too candidates.
[01:29:51.983 --> 01:29:55.604]  Whatever the Democrats said, the Republican candidate would say Me Too.
[01:29:56.104 --> 01:30:00.225]  That's right, and it's an updated and expanded 50th anniversary issue.
[01:30:00.245 --> 01:30:02.245]  It brings it up to date.
[01:30:02.326 --> 01:30:03.726]  Tell us about the book before we go to break.
[01:30:04.586 --> 01:30:14.288]  Well, the original book I published in 1964, and of course I couldn't get any publishers so I did it myself, and sold 3 million copies out of my garage.
[01:30:15.303 --> 01:30:18.046]  And that is what created the conservative movement.
[01:30:18.466 --> 01:30:24.613]  Because it told people that we had a real conservative in support, Barry Goldwater, and we could do it.
[01:30:25.013 --> 01:30:28.476]  And we did nominate him in the convention, despite everything.
[01:30:28.937 --> 01:30:34.863]  And then, of course, the big boys smashed him in the general election.
[01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:38.927]  But we got our reward a few years later when we elected Ronald Reagan.
[01:30:39.702 --> 01:30:49.524]  And if we hadn't created the conservative movement with The Choice Not to Echo in 1964, we wouldn't have gotten Ronald Reagan as the greatest president of the 20th century in 1980.
[01:30:49.944 --> 01:30:51.305]  Fellas, stay there.
[01:30:52.105 --> 01:30:53.445]  This is so important, folks.
[01:30:53.485 --> 01:30:56.226]  What one lady did with a book, changing history.
[01:30:56.266 --> 01:30:57.486]  You could change history, too.
[01:30:57.786 --> 01:30:58.266]  Stay with us.
[01:30:58.806 --> 01:30:59.707]  We're on the march.
[01:31:00.207 --> 01:31:01.827]  The empire's on the run.
[01:31:02.727 --> 01:31:05.428]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:31:09.491 --> 01:31:15.772]  When I first got online and I seen the price of the X2 and the DNA Force, I was a little hesitant, but I pulled the trigger on it.
[01:31:15.912 --> 01:31:16.893]  It has changed my life.
[01:31:16.973 --> 01:31:18.973]  I've been taking it for about 24 days now.
[01:31:19.073 --> 01:31:20.433]  Counting the weights, staying in shape.
[01:31:20.573 --> 01:31:23.034]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:23.134 --> 01:31:24.574]  You've heard the callers of the show.
[01:31:24.594 --> 01:31:28.535]  Several months back, I started taking your nascent iodine and your super meal.
[01:31:28.595 --> 01:31:30.455]  Prior to this, I was barely walking.
[01:31:30.575 --> 01:31:33.216]  Now, I'm able to function as a human again.
[01:31:33.336 --> 01:31:51.248]  Whether it's Survival Shield Nascent Iodine, or DNA Force, Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality, Lung Cleanse, Fluoride Shield, Oxy Powder, I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:51.268 --> 01:31:56.552]  They actually do just amazing what it's able to do to actually detox the body.

[01:31:57.793 --> 01:31:58.655]  I'm gonna promote something.
[01:31:58.715 --> 01:32:01.499]  It's gotta be something I personally use and that I believe in.
[01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:08.472]  Check out Infowarslife.com today and the entire line of groundbreaking, cutting-edge, hardcore products.

[01:32:19.530 --> 01:32:29.275]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:32:29.455 --> 01:32:32.377]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body.
[01:32:32.577 --> 01:32:35.420]  And contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients.
[01:32:35.621 --> 01:32:39.686]  Often times full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[01:32:39.826 --> 01:32:44.231]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[01:32:44.491 --> 01:32:46.774]  Oxy powder does not require time off work.
[01:32:46.934 --> 01:32:49.177]  And there's no need for bad tasting concoctions.
[01:32:49.477 --> 01:32:54.922]  Instead, Oxy-Powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[01:32:55.162 --> 01:33:00.387]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.

[01:33:09.875 --> 01:33:15.937]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[01:33:15.997 --> 01:33:19.299]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:33:19.319 --> 01:33:21.039]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[01:33:21.059 --> 01:33:27.362]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:33:27.462 --> 01:33:33.344]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote homeless security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[01:33:33.504 --> 01:33:37.266]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:33:37.446 --> 01:33:40.367]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:33:40.407 --> 01:33:48.531]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:33:48.811 --> 01:33:50.852]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:33:50.912 --> 01:33:51.933]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:33:52.313 --> 01:34:01.057]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[01:34:01.257 --> 01:34:03.698]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.
[01:34:03.918 --> 01:34:08.220]  Become a member, share your membership, and help take the info war to the next level.
[01:34:23.815 --> 01:34:32.540]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:34:36.602 --> 01:34:44.686]  It was Barry Goldwater who almost became president, but they ran TV ads saying there'd be nuclear war, we'd all die if he got elected.
[01:34:46.072 --> 01:34:57.639]  The Trilateralist Commission is international and is intended to be the vehicle for the multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political government of the United States.
[01:34:58.618 --> 01:35:08.990]  The Trilateralist Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power, political, monetary, intellectual, and ecclesiastical.
[01:35:09.310 --> 01:35:10.552]  They've got most of the churches.
[01:35:10.932 --> 01:35:12.474]  They've got things by the Federal Reserve.
[01:35:12.774 --> 01:35:14.977]  They've got the Democratic Party and most of the Republicans.
[01:35:15.217 --> 01:35:16.699]  They've taken control of the universities.
[01:35:18.424 --> 01:35:20.026]  That's from his book, from a U.S.
[01:35:20.046 --> 01:35:23.389]  Senator from Arizona, Barry Goldwater, with no apologies.
[01:35:24.290 --> 01:35:27.614]  And I know folks that knew Barry Goldwater, just as, of course, Phyllis Schlafly knew him well.
[01:35:27.654 --> 01:35:28.575]  What a great guy.
[01:35:28.975 --> 01:35:30.977]  How wonderful it would have been to have him as president.
[01:35:31.478 --> 01:35:36.583]  Reagan had great rhetoric about how, you know, you did build your business, and freedom's great, and everything else.
[01:35:37.644 --> 01:35:40.725]  Politics got away from him in the Congress and some bad things happened.
[01:35:41.706 --> 01:35:45.107]  Some things I disagree with under Reagan and Ron Paul criticized those as well.
[01:35:45.147 --> 01:35:52.050]  But compare Ronald Reagan to Obama who says you didn't build your business and Hillary came out and said businesses don't hire people.
[01:35:52.650 --> 01:35:54.211]  There's a war against reality.
[01:35:54.231 --> 01:35:59.793]  We're going to talk to her and walk through this new edition of her book because it's very exciting and I want to hear some of these stories.
[01:36:01.082 --> 01:36:07.045]  Then we're going to open the phones up for your quick question or comment, whether you agree, disagree, whatever, for Phyllis Schlafly.
[01:36:07.426 --> 01:36:11.188]  The toll-free number to join us on this live Monday edition is 800-259-9231.
[01:36:11.208 --> 01:36:11.248]  800-259-9231.
[01:36:11.268 --> 01:36:13.489]  Questions or comments for Phyllis Schlafly.
[01:36:13.509 --> 01:36:14.650]  Again, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:36:14.670 --> 01:36:15.890]  Before we go any further,
[01:36:27.486 --> 01:36:30.768]  We've got a whole bunch of new shirts made in America.
[01:36:31.169 --> 01:36:37.754]  The fabric, they're printed in America, everything, the cotton's grown in America, have come in at Madein1776.com.
[01:36:38.014 --> 01:36:44.259]  Now, I'm wearing right now one of the first that came out last year when we launched the Made in 1776 line.
[01:36:45.239 --> 01:36:48.762]  But this is the Join or Die shirt, one of my favorites.
[01:36:48.802 --> 01:36:53.686]  But we've got some of the new ones in, the Camo, Molon, Lambe, and others.
[01:36:54.446 --> 01:36:59.971]  And we've got the .50 caliber 1776 bottle breachers that just won Shark Tank last week.
[01:37:00.251 --> 01:37:04.315]  We're going to get one of those Navy SEALs that owns the company on in the next few days.
[01:37:04.956 --> 01:37:07.278]  The point is, we know stuff that's interesting.
[01:37:07.658 --> 01:37:13.644]  We've got some new belt buckles coming in that are Molon Labe that will sell out quickly, that are made in America.
[01:37:13.964 --> 01:37:14.765]  And all of this
[01:37:16.297 --> 01:37:18.019]  Funds the InfoWars operation.
[01:37:18.039 --> 01:37:19.460]  We're not like MSNBC.
[01:37:20.241 --> 01:37:24.245]  They got stimulus money or NPR that gets 400 million of taxpayer money every year.
[01:37:25.106 --> 01:37:29.451]  We are funded by folks buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com
[01:37:30.856 --> 01:37:36.583]  Or madein1776.com or the great supplements at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:37:37.124 --> 01:37:42.190]  Now, InfoWarsStore.com takes you to a directory of all those sites and shopping carts.
[01:37:42.670 --> 01:37:44.453]  It's basically like a whole shopping center right there.
[01:37:45.093 --> 01:37:48.437]  But when you buy the products from us, it funds the operation.
[01:37:48.457 --> 01:37:50.160]  You're shopping with the good guys.
[01:37:51.727 --> 01:38:06.033]  On top of it, the proprietary supplements like DNA Force, Survival Shield, X2, Oxy Powder, all of it is proprietary to the site and to our developer, Dr. Group, and you've heard the incredible reviews out there.
[01:38:06.553 --> 01:38:19.999]  So, InfoWarsLife.com, and here's the good news, the products are very popular, here's the bad news, we are about to sell out of Survival Shield, we are about to sell out of Lung Cleanse, we are about to sell out of DNA Force, Oxy Powder, Super Mel Vitality, basically everything.
[01:38:20.729 --> 01:38:29.096]  Right as more colloidal silver is set to come in next week, and right as one of our new products is set to come in next week, we actually have some of it in but not enough to even offer it.
[01:38:30.017 --> 01:38:33.720]  So if you want any of these products, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:38:34.061 --> 01:38:39.606]  Also recommend the Great Longevity line of products discounted at InfoWarsHealth.com.
[01:38:39.906 --> 01:38:45.611]  The Beyond Tangy Tangerine, the Pollen Burst, just the Alex Pack.

[01:38:57.134 --> 01:39:01.015]  You can call, ask about these specials, and our great crew will answer your questions.
[01:39:01.035 --> 01:39:03.415]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:39:03.855 --> 01:39:07.596]  Going back to Phyllis Schlafly, of course, of the Eagle Forum.
[01:39:07.996 --> 01:39:09.537]  Phyllis, talk about some of the history.
[01:39:09.577 --> 01:39:10.797]  Talk about Barry Goldwater.
[01:39:11.117 --> 01:39:15.198]  Talk about the new edition of your book and why it's so important for people to get it.
[01:39:16.670 --> 01:39:22.292]  Well, when I brought out A Choice Not An Echo, it had this enormous sale.
[01:39:22.792 --> 01:39:31.454]  And what it did was to inspire people to believe that the grassroots could win against the establishment and nominate a real conservative.
[01:39:31.855 --> 01:39:39.537]  Now let me remind you that in that time period, presidents were supposed to come from New York, Pennsylvania, or Ohio.
[01:39:40.117 --> 01:39:42.358]  And Barry Goldwater was from Arizona.
[01:39:42.918 --> 01:39:46.219]  I didn't know anybody who had ever been to Arizona.
[01:39:46.849 --> 01:39:50.711]  There was no baseball team that was farther west or south than St.
[01:39:50.752 --> 01:39:51.092]  Louis.
[01:39:51.692 --> 01:39:53.333]  It was so far away and so distant.
[01:39:53.413 --> 01:39:55.995]  And yet we picked him, and we made speeches for him.
[01:39:56.015 --> 01:39:57.996]  I made speeches all over the country for him.
[01:39:58.636 --> 01:40:01.438]  And we... It did get him nominated.
[01:40:01.538 --> 01:40:03.540]  Of course, they clobbered him in the election.
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:07.522]  But we stayed together as a grassroots conservative.
[01:40:08.203 --> 01:40:13.646]  And then came Ronald Reagan, and we got him elected, and he had two wonderful presidencies.
[01:40:14.350 --> 01:40:17.672]  Not perfect, but certainly better than anything that Democrats had to offer.
[01:40:18.472 --> 01:40:24.035]  And then they kind of disintegrated after that, and we had people who pretended to be conservatives, they really weren't.
[01:40:25.010 --> 01:40:27.352]  And we've got to revive them.
[01:40:27.732 --> 01:40:33.115]  And that's why I've come out with my 50th anniversary edition of A Choice Not An Echo.
[01:40:33.355 --> 01:40:35.337]  Now, it's not a rewrite of the original.
[01:40:35.417 --> 01:40:38.359]  The original's in there just as I wrote it in 64.
[01:40:38.859 --> 01:40:50.286]  But what I do is to bring it up to date with the shenanigans and the behind-the-closed-door deals that were made in all the Republican National Conventions after 1964.
[01:40:50.326 --> 01:40:52.988]  Brings it right up to date.
[01:40:53.602 --> 01:41:01.428]  And I'm telling listeners, you can't be a player in the presidential election next year unless you know the history, unless you know what's in the past.
[01:41:02.008 --> 01:41:06.171]  Because we want to pick somebody who's picked by the grassroots.
[01:41:06.572 --> 01:41:16.539]  We don't want somebody who wants to bring in all this cheap labor and export our good jobs abroad to cheap labor countries.
[01:41:18.899 --> 01:41:23.742]  So it's a big challenge, but you need to know the history in order to get going in the battle.
[01:41:24.082 --> 01:41:24.403]  I agree.
[01:41:24.423 --> 01:41:27.905]  Phyllis, the founder of the Eagle Forum, Phyllis Schlafly, is our guest.
[01:41:28.605 --> 01:41:30.807]  I want to bring up some inside baseball stories here.
[01:41:30.827 --> 01:41:42.574]  I've been told by high-level folks that at the nomination process for the 1980 election, and I've seen the speeches and seen video clips where Ronald Reagan
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:43.800]  What's
[01:42:03.086 --> 01:42:06.231]  And then you have the Clinton dynasty and the Bushes working together.
[01:42:06.291 --> 01:42:10.917]  I was always told at the time that Bush had basically fallen down on the election so Clinton could get in.
[01:42:11.278 --> 01:42:12.680]  Now they call him another son.
[01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:14.403]  That's basically been admitted.
[01:42:14.503 --> 01:42:16.265]  Now we're back to more Clinton and Bush.
[01:42:18.002 --> 01:42:32.536]  Well, let me say, Alex, the story of what they tried to do to Reagan when they realized he was going to be nominated is told in my new book, A Choice, Not an Echo, and it's quite a behind-the-scenes story.
[01:42:33.016 --> 01:42:38.241]  What they tried to do was to make Gerald Ford co-president.
[01:42:38.821 --> 01:42:43.823]  And when Dan Rather accosted me on the floor of the convention, he said, what do you think about this, Mr. Schlafly?
[01:42:44.203 --> 01:42:46.364]  And I said, well, it's completely unconstitutional.
[01:42:46.644 --> 01:42:59.508]  You want to give the Vice President control of the budget, the money, our sovereignty issues, our tax issues, and leave President Reagan with nothing but the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
[01:42:59.528 --> 01:43:02.069]  Well, let's stop right there, because this is such a big deal.
[01:43:02.089 --> 01:43:04.630]  You're confirming what I was told when I was, you know,
[01:43:05.550 --> 01:43:11.563]  A kid, and when I've talked to high-level Republicans that were there, you were there on record on national television, you were behind the scenes.
[01:43:12.345 --> 01:43:14.550]  The establishment was so afraid of Reagan...
[01:43:15.259 --> 01:43:25.002]  That they were trying to get him to agree to be a titular head and try to change the Constitution illegally inside the party.
[01:43:25.362 --> 01:43:26.722]  Break down exactly what happened.
[01:43:26.763 --> 01:43:27.523]  It's sensational.
[01:43:27.823 --> 01:43:29.003]  Well, tell a story.
[01:43:29.063 --> 01:43:31.464]  It might be a new edition of A Choice Not An Echo.
[01:43:31.784 --> 01:43:35.865]  But they wanted to give all the real power to the Vice President, who would be Gerald Ford.
[01:43:36.385 --> 01:43:41.487]  And the reason they wanted Gerald Ford was that he was the man who took his orders from Henry Kissinger.
[01:43:42.927 --> 01:43:49.769]  And they thought that that would enable him to run the country even if Reagan were elected president.
[01:43:50.469 --> 01:44:00.591]  And that is why Reagan was pounded so heavily by them that he called George Bush at 11.25 that night.
[01:44:00.811 --> 01:44:05.452]  And I was there in the convention hall at 11.25 and said, get on over here.
[01:44:05.612 --> 01:44:07.352]  Bush was already in his pajamas.
[01:44:07.412 --> 01:44:09.593]  He had given up any hope of being on the ticket.
[01:44:10.260 --> 01:44:15.662]  And Reagan brought him over and introduced Bush because he was afraid he couldn't get through the night.
[01:44:15.902 --> 01:44:25.025]  You know, Walter Cronkite from the Skybox had already announced that Gerald Ford was going to be the co-president and have the real power.
[01:44:27.222 --> 01:44:37.291]  So the elites were just struggling to get their people in, and so George Herbert Walker Bush was seen as a better person for him to choose than Gerald Ford.
[01:44:37.651 --> 01:44:38.071]  Oh yeah.
[01:44:38.472 --> 01:44:39.292]  Bush, sure.
[01:44:39.493 --> 01:44:47.660]  But the first George Bush was the choice of the establishment, no question about that, and the grassroots were for Ronald Reagan.
[01:44:49.301 --> 01:44:52.644]  And then we had enough delegates to nominate Reagan
[01:44:53.311 --> 01:45:07.135]  But the establishment, the so-called kingmakers, cooked up this deal by which they thought they could take the power away from the president and give it to a vice president they could control.
[01:45:08.836 --> 01:45:09.836]  It's amazing though.
[01:45:09.876 --> 01:45:15.078]  So we learned that Ronald Reagan really was anti-New World Order, anti-globalist.
[01:45:16.318 --> 01:45:16.638]  Sure.
[01:45:16.959 --> 01:45:18.159]  But then he gets shot.
[01:45:19.930 --> 01:45:22.391]  And then he goes in for treatment and comes back out.
[01:45:22.931 --> 01:45:24.572]  I know you were in both administrations.
[01:45:24.632 --> 01:45:27.233]  What can you say about what happened inside of those administrations?
[01:45:28.273 --> 01:45:30.354]  Well, Reagan wasn't perfect.
[01:45:30.494 --> 01:45:32.975]  But he certainly was better than anybody else in sight.
[01:45:33.635 --> 01:45:35.636]  And he was the choice of the grassroots.
[01:45:36.376 --> 01:45:42.178]  And he did not turn over all his power to Ford or anybody else.
[01:45:42.999 --> 01:45:45.500]  And yes, he made a number of mistakes.
[01:45:46.756 --> 01:45:51.461]  That's a big difference from Obama who obviously wants to destroy it.
[01:46:10.128 --> 01:46:13.209]  Well, our ideals were better and we certainly were exceptional.
[01:46:13.789 --> 01:46:20.872]  Now we're an exceptional paradox of just horrible socialists and crony capitalists and then all the other free market folks making this country go.
[01:46:21.212 --> 01:46:29.395]  Why do you think the Democrats are so arrogant now and admit they're lying and admit they want to wreck the economy and saying you didn't build your business?
[01:46:29.895 --> 01:46:31.575]  I mean, that's a way to discredit themselves.
[01:46:31.635 --> 01:46:32.976]  Are they that disconnected?
[01:46:34.369 --> 01:46:43.282]  Well, they have a lot of rich people, and they've always had more money than the grassroots movement.
[01:46:43.723 --> 01:46:48.469]  And I think they were doing a bit of gloating, but they...
[01:46:50.362 --> 01:46:53.145]  They simply want to continue to control things.
[01:46:53.185 --> 01:46:53.985]  They always have.
[01:46:54.446 --> 01:47:07.618]  And I'm telling the people listening to this program, we beat them in 1964 when we nominated Goldwater, and we beat them in 1980 and 1984 when we nominated Ronald Reagan, and we can do it again if you'll get with it.
[01:47:08.098 --> 01:47:15.825]  Read my books so you know the shenanigans they pulled before, and we won't let them get by with giving us another loser for president this time.
[01:47:15.945 --> 01:47:22.670]  Well, I've never seen the establishment this scared, and I've gone back through the history, and I want to see if you concur with that.
[01:47:23.010 --> 01:47:26.372]  They are really scared of the Tea Party insurrection taking over the Republicans.
[01:47:26.872 --> 01:47:34.377]  They are absolutely lining up against it, but I'm seeing a lot of good signs of major talk show hosts realizing that and now saying that.
[01:47:35.138 --> 01:47:43.163]  And what do you expect them to pull now to try to get a Chris Christie or a Jeb Bush over a Rand Paul or a Ted Cruz?
[01:47:43.724 --> 01:47:44.684]  What do you expect them to pull?
[01:47:45.885 --> 01:47:50.971]  Well, I'm not picking my guy at the present time, but I can tell you it's pretty clear that their number one guy is Jeb Bush.
[01:48:04.419 --> 01:48:09.624]  You know, they believe in the British system of primogeniture.
[01:48:09.665 --> 01:48:11.306]  They want to take the next one in line.
[01:48:11.847 --> 01:48:14.709]  And if there's the next one in line, there's been one loser after another.
[01:48:14.729 --> 01:48:17.952]  I don't believe the American people are willing to elect another Bush.
[01:48:18.173 --> 01:48:19.754]  Yeah, we rejected royalty in 1776.
[01:48:19.814 --> 01:48:20.014]  We did.
[01:48:21.969 --> 01:48:32.194]  And so, but the grassroots can do it, so get on out, join, and realize that the fight is in the Republican Party.
[01:48:32.274 --> 01:48:34.095]  That's where the important fight is.
[01:48:34.515 --> 01:48:41.859]  Now, we lost several good candidates, including my own candidate for state rep by the Libertarian votes.
[01:48:42.719 --> 01:48:46.141]  It took more than his margin by which he lost.
[01:48:48.617 --> 01:48:53.200]  Maybe you wish we had many parties, like other countries do.
[01:48:53.220 --> 01:48:55.241]  I don't wish that, but some people may.
[01:48:55.881 --> 01:48:57.662]  But we have a two-party system.
[01:48:58.242 --> 01:49:03.265]  Well, I've clearly said... You go to war with the army you have, not the army you wish you had.
[01:49:03.645 --> 01:49:04.426]  Well, I agree.
[01:49:05.166 --> 01:49:12.390]  I vote Libertarian when both candidates are bad, but I said in this election, if there's a Tea Party patriot running against a Democrat,
[01:49:13.110 --> 01:49:17.315]  And even if they're not perfect, you've got to vote for them because this is a referendum on tyranny.
[01:49:17.555 --> 01:49:18.917]  We have to bring them down.
[01:49:19.197 --> 01:49:20.438]  We have to bloody their nose.
[01:49:20.699 --> 01:49:22.000]  We have to make them pay.
[01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:24.262]  We've got to take over.
[01:49:24.283 --> 01:49:25.404]  And we did a pretty good job.
[01:49:25.644 --> 01:49:25.844]  Yeah.
[01:49:26.605 --> 01:49:27.706]  We did a pretty good job.
[01:49:27.766 --> 01:49:28.527]  I was really proud of it.
[01:49:28.547 --> 01:49:32.892]  We didn't get everybody, but we got an awful lot and a lot more than they expected us to get.
[01:49:34.841 --> 01:49:36.403]  Well, Phyllis, it's just amazing.
[01:49:37.504 --> 01:49:40.847]  I want to have you back on again soon just to talk about the book for a full hour.
[01:49:40.887 --> 01:49:42.869]  I want to go to a few phone calls.
[01:49:42.889 --> 01:49:45.952]  Yes, because I've got so many good inside stories.
[01:49:46.412 --> 01:49:48.334]  And it's up to date.
[01:49:48.955 --> 01:49:51.657]  And you've got to have the ammo if you're going to go to battle.
[01:49:53.659 --> 01:49:54.160]  Wow.
[01:49:54.260 --> 01:49:59.145]  And the ammo is A Choice, Not an Echo, New 50th Anniversary Edition.
[01:49:59.841 --> 01:50:03.024]  Well, I want to talk to the publisher and maybe carry it at the InfoWars store as well.
[01:50:03.064 --> 01:50:03.944]  I can't wait to read it.
[01:50:03.964 --> 01:50:07.127]  I mean, I read the original book, but I haven't, that was like 15 years ago.
[01:50:07.147 --> 01:50:10.790]  I want to read this updated, expanded version.
[01:50:10.850 --> 01:50:11.931]  Phyllis Schlafly is our guest.
[01:50:11.971 --> 01:50:17.515]  I want to go to a few phone calls here when we come back from break, but maybe we'll skip this network break for time.
[01:50:17.535 --> 01:50:21.899]  But Phyllis, anything else you'd like to add to the viewers and listeners out there?
[01:50:22.287 --> 01:50:29.435]  Well, what's in the book is the inside story, like that 1980 behind-the-scenes story of what they tried to do with Reagan.
[01:50:29.815 --> 01:50:31.197]  It's just simply incredible.
[01:50:32.023 --> 01:50:34.185]  And it shows you how these people operate.
[01:50:34.265 --> 01:50:38.728]  And they've got the power and the clout and they do a lot.
[01:50:38.808 --> 01:50:41.349]  But I think people are waking up to that.
[01:50:41.910 --> 01:50:49.595]  You know, at the present time, what they're trying to do is to give Obama more power than the previous president's ever had.
[01:50:49.655 --> 01:50:56.600]  They want to give him fast track so he can make any deal with foreign countries and not even let Congress know.
[01:50:56.680 --> 01:50:58.361]  Make a deal and make it into the law.
[01:50:59.164 --> 01:51:00.245]  It's called fast track.
[01:51:00.285 --> 01:51:01.965]  Why would we give him any more power?
[01:51:02.266 --> 01:51:03.626]  It blows my mind.
[01:51:05.287 --> 01:51:05.928]  That's right.
[01:51:06.468 --> 01:51:10.830]  In fact, I've seen some Rand Paul statements where he's like, we need to get trade done.
[01:51:11.350 --> 01:51:14.172]  And he needs to clarify that because that's what the other Republicans are saying.
[01:51:14.212 --> 01:51:15.453]  It means give him the power.
[01:51:16.233 --> 01:51:23.257]  He's been given a mandate to be indicted, to be impeached, not a mandate to expand power.
[01:51:23.297 --> 01:51:25.158]  The mandate is repeal Obamacare.
[01:51:25.578 --> 01:51:27.159]  Phyllis Schlafly, what's going to happen
[01:51:27.939 --> 01:51:43.154]  If the neocons and rhinos are able to suppress the Liberty Movement and the Republican Party, and if they don't repeal Obamacare, if they don't shut the President down, if they let him shut down more power plants, if they let him have executive amnesty, I mean, if they do that, what's going to happen?
[01:51:44.015 --> 01:51:46.498]  Well, I'm making up my mind that's not going to happen.
[01:51:48.423 --> 01:51:54.868]  And we've got to educate the grassroots and tell them that they have the power if they will only use it.
[01:51:55.208 --> 01:51:56.629]  That's what we're up against today.
[01:51:56.649 --> 01:52:00.512]  Because a lot of people, you realize that not many people can remember 1964 now.
[01:52:03.955 --> 01:52:08.877]  We need to tell them that we are a country of we the people.
[01:52:09.298 --> 01:52:11.038]  Well, I'll say this about Barry Goldwater.
[01:52:11.679 --> 01:52:18.182]  I mean, nobody was talking about New World Order and trilateral commissions and, you know, just all this stuff back when he was.
[01:52:18.562 --> 01:52:22.724]  He was doing it when it was like speaking Martian because he really cared and was warning people.
[01:52:23.044 --> 01:52:24.725]  He was being the opposite of a politician.
[01:52:25.125 --> 01:52:26.846]  He was being a statesman and studying the two.
[01:52:27.726 --> 01:52:33.970]  Though Reagan was probably more well-spoken and maybe better looking, Barry Goldwater would have been an incredible president.
[01:52:35.151 --> 01:52:37.212]  Yes, he was an authentic conservative.
[01:52:38.078 --> 01:52:39.378]  And that's what we want.
[01:52:39.818 --> 01:52:44.840]  Somebody who really cares about this country and believes our country should be the best and the biggest.
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:56.763]  One of the things that I have been responsible for repeatedly putting in the Republican policy platform, adopted at the Republican Convention, is that we need military superiority.
[01:52:57.243 --> 01:52:59.143]  It's not enough to be just strong.
[01:52:59.663 --> 01:53:01.584]  We've got to be the biggest and the best.
[01:53:02.084 --> 01:53:06.045]  And that's the best key to peace for ourselves and for everybody else.
[01:53:06.834 --> 01:53:11.296]  Well, it would be if we didn't have neocons and Obama launching all these wars.
[01:53:11.697 --> 01:53:13.558]  That's why people want to cut the military.
[01:53:13.638 --> 01:53:19.921]  My concern is they're trying to twist the military into a domestic force with all those memos to go after the Tea Party.
[01:53:20.221 --> 01:53:21.142]  Do you find that chilling?
[01:53:21.826 --> 01:53:25.228]  Yes, and I also find it chilling that they're putting women in combat.
[01:53:25.628 --> 01:53:29.150]  I don't have any respect for the military who send women into combat.
[01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:38.274]  It's kind of like if you hear a noise in your house in the middle of the night and the husband turns over and says, honey, you go on downstairs and see what's going on.
[01:53:39.094 --> 01:53:40.535]  Well, it's a war on reality.
[01:53:40.595 --> 01:53:44.397]  I mean, men can't make babies and men are ugly and women look good.
[01:53:44.457 --> 01:53:46.418]  I mean, there are differences.
[01:53:46.478 --> 01:53:48.219]  The job of a man is to protect their family.
[01:53:49.085 --> 01:53:49.546]  Exactly.
[01:53:49.586 --> 01:53:50.447]  It's men's jobs.
[01:53:50.487 --> 01:53:54.472]  I mean, men, at least the men I know, want to protect their family.
[01:53:54.792 --> 01:53:55.373]  Sure they do.
[01:53:55.914 --> 01:54:04.665]  That's why recent figures show that men who have children earn more money than men who don't.
[01:54:05.185 --> 01:54:06.888]  Well, that's just because they work harder.
[01:54:07.008 --> 01:54:07.829]  They've got a motive.
[01:54:09.497 --> 01:54:14.120]  Well, the minute my wife had our first child, my son, all the, it just clicked.
[01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:20.864]  Everything in me, I suddenly wanted to be more successful, wanted to work harder, grew up a lot, and it's biological.
[01:54:21.545 --> 01:54:21.765]  Yeah.
[01:54:22.705 --> 01:54:24.785]  And we need to encourage that.
[01:54:24.805 --> 01:54:32.867]  Of course, you're fighting the feminists, but you need to read my other book, Who Killed the American Family?, and you'll see the damage that the feminists did.
[01:54:32.967 --> 01:54:34.007]  I have read that book.
[01:54:34.067 --> 01:54:37.208]  I want to have you back on in a few weeks, so you'll do it just on that book as well.
[01:54:37.648 --> 01:54:38.848]  Phyllis Schlafly is our guest.
[01:54:38.948 --> 01:54:40.249]  Randy in Texas.
[01:54:40.369 --> 01:54:42.229]  Randy, you're on the air.
[01:54:42.269 --> 01:54:42.729]  Go ahead.
[01:54:43.830 --> 01:54:44.730]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:54:44.790 --> 01:54:46.950]  Phyllis, you are God sent.
[01:54:48.771 --> 01:54:50.591]  I went to a program the other evening
[01:54:51.351 --> 01:54:53.472]  Where John Danforth was the speaker.
[01:54:53.492 --> 01:55:03.435]  I know you know John probably very well, and I'd like you to speak about him a little bit, but let me just tell you one thing that he said that was very disturbing to me.
[01:55:03.455 --> 01:55:13.738]  He told me, point blank, that his wife campaigned and raised funds for Mark Pryor in Arkansas.
[01:55:15.259 --> 01:55:19.220]  If that is going on Republican to Democrat,
[01:55:20.447 --> 01:55:30.273]  Something is grossly wrong in this country and I'd like you to address what you believe that Mr. Danforth's position really is on the Republican Party and conservatism in general.
[01:55:31.254 --> 01:55:37.738]  Well, it's not surprising because we in Missouri, I live in Missouri, consider him part of the establishment crowd.
[01:55:38.562 --> 01:55:39.583]  I'm happy to tell you.
[01:55:53.613 --> 01:55:59.139]  That in the last election for Missouri State Chairman, we elected a grassrooter.
[01:55:59.359 --> 01:56:01.141]  We elected a real conservative.
[01:56:01.561 --> 01:56:03.223]  And you know, it's kind of funny.
[01:56:03.783 --> 01:56:09.129]  Missouri has a pretty slick system for electing the state chairman.
[01:56:09.449 --> 01:56:11.511]  It's kind of like the way they elect the Pope.
[01:56:12.052 --> 01:56:15.155]  They had a secret ballot, and somebody counts the ballots.
[01:56:15.836 --> 01:56:21.604]  And, uh, Ed Martin won by about three or four votes, and then they immediately take the ballots out and burn them.
[01:56:21.924 --> 01:56:26.791]  That's the way the Pope, they do for the Pope, you know, and the smoke goes up and then the people know there's been a new Pope.
[01:56:27.651 --> 01:56:31.633]  Well, anyway, we got a conservative, a non-establishment guy.
[01:56:32.073 --> 01:56:33.654]  And you can do that in your state.
[01:56:34.174 --> 01:56:39.336]  And get your grassroots elected as delegates to the Republican National Convention.
[01:56:39.356 --> 01:56:39.996]  Very exciting.
[01:56:40.016 --> 01:56:40.877]  We're almost out of time.
[01:56:40.937 --> 01:56:41.897]  Thank you so much, Randy.
[01:56:41.917 --> 01:56:43.678]  I'll see if Phil can do five more into overdrive.
[01:56:43.978 --> 01:56:46.039]  Paul Watson's coming on overdrive into the next hour.
[01:56:46.079 --> 01:56:48.100]  I've got Paul Watson coming on with huge breaking news.
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:50.481]  I'm trying to get as many of these calls as possible.
[01:56:51.401 --> 01:56:53.262]  I think the Democrats have jumped the shark.
[01:56:54.022 --> 01:56:57.503]  In that they just openly say, we're criminals, we're liars, ah-ha-ha.
[01:56:57.983 --> 01:56:59.763]  I believe they've gone insane like Nero.
[01:57:00.463 --> 01:57:03.424]  And we've got a real chance to beat them now, folks.
[01:57:03.444 --> 01:57:06.945]  They've had so much power that they've acted like lunatics.
[01:57:07.445 --> 01:57:09.865]  And the Republicans that have worked with them are going to be exposed.
[01:57:10.366 --> 01:57:13.666]  If we take this initiative, I believe we can take the country back.
[01:57:13.686 --> 01:57:14.786]  Phyllis, what do you say to that?
[01:57:15.107 --> 01:57:16.487]  Yes, I do.
[01:57:16.747 --> 01:57:17.927]  I absolutely do believe.
[01:57:18.287 --> 01:57:19.587]  And not only that, we must.
[01:57:20.568 --> 01:57:21.708]  Our future depends on it.
[01:57:23.448 --> 01:57:25.449]  Go to my website, EagleFarm.org.
[01:57:26.069 --> 01:57:27.549]  Let's go to Patrick in Texas.
[01:57:27.589 --> 01:57:28.350]  Patrick, you're on the air.
[01:57:28.390 --> 01:57:28.690]  Go ahead.
[01:57:29.950 --> 01:57:30.730]  Hey, Alex.
[01:57:30.910 --> 01:57:33.031]  It's a pleasure listening to you.
[01:57:33.051 --> 01:57:33.851]  Hi, Phyllis.
[01:57:34.392 --> 01:57:35.232]  Hi.
[01:57:36.112 --> 01:57:41.394]  I was a fan of Reagan when I found out that he tried to get rid of the Federal Reserve.
[01:57:41.634 --> 01:57:43.274]  And I think that's why they tried to murder him.
[01:57:43.875 --> 01:57:44.135]  You know?
[01:57:44.455 --> 01:57:45.195]  And the IRS.
[01:57:45.435 --> 01:57:45.615]  Yep.
[01:57:46.155 --> 01:57:47.096]  Yeah, and the IRS.
[01:57:47.496 --> 01:57:51.257]  And also, as far as, you know, businesses creating jobs.
[01:57:51.744 --> 01:58:02.882]  The one thing that I think about is the public, you know, their demand for a product, and then the banks allowing the public to get money in order to make these products and actually start entrepreneurship.
[01:58:03.123 --> 01:58:06.388]  And that doesn't happen, and you know, that's the biggest enemy we have are the banks.
[01:58:07.484 --> 01:58:11.167]  Well, the central banks that are waging war on the regular banks, I agree with you.
[01:58:11.207 --> 01:58:14.190]  Fellas, who is the biggest enemy in corporate America?
[01:58:14.210 --> 01:58:17.413]  You mentioned Chamber of Commerce, all these groups.
[01:58:17.914 --> 01:58:20.676]  The unions vote for open borders, they vote for NAFTA and GATT.
[01:58:21.457 --> 01:58:24.040]  I mean, it's just all these special interests are controlled by who?
[01:58:25.464 --> 01:58:37.416]  Well, I don't know that they're all controlled by anybody, but we certainly...all these groups are pushing for open borders, and we shouldn't let them get by with it, because the majority of people don't want that.
[01:58:38.056 --> 01:58:41.039]  And what they just want is cheap labor.
[01:58:41.099 --> 01:58:41.920]  That's what it's for.
[01:58:42.581 --> 01:58:47.926]  And we should reform the laws that are encouraging businesses to send their good jobs overseas.
[01:58:49.043 --> 01:58:49.964]  It's just awful.
[01:58:50.365 --> 01:58:51.506]  Free trade is such a deceit.
[01:58:51.526 --> 01:58:53.447]  No, I have to go have another.
[01:59:08.263 --> 01:59:16.859]  Can't feminists now see that what they were sold as feminism doesn't empower women and has actually really screwed up women's position and everybody's position?
[01:59:16.879 --> 01:59:18.503]  I mean, isn't feminism in trouble?
[01:59:19.218 --> 01:59:23.361]  Feminism is in big trouble, but we can discuss that the next time I come on your show.
[01:59:23.901 --> 01:59:24.341]  All right.
[01:59:24.461 --> 01:59:27.623]  Well, thank you so much for joining us, Phyllis Schlafly.
[01:59:28.063 --> 01:59:28.524]  Okay.
[01:59:28.724 --> 01:59:29.224]  Bye, Alex.
[01:59:29.404 --> 01:59:29.704]  All right.
[01:59:29.744 --> 01:59:30.865]  Very interesting lady, folks.
[01:59:30.945 --> 01:59:40.551]  I'm telling you, she really is at the heart of what you see with the Tea Party, Liberty Movement, you name it, today, battling the Republican Rockefeller bluebloods.
[01:59:41.592 --> 01:59:44.073]  And, I mean, they would have totally taken over if it wasn't for folks like her.
[01:59:44.673 --> 01:59:44.854]  All right.
[01:59:44.874 --> 01:59:45.974]  I'm going to go to a few of your calls.
[01:59:46.034 --> 01:59:48.756]  I didn't miss talking to her when we come back with Paul Watson with breaking news.
[01:59:49.257 --> 01:59:52.101]  Huge vaccine dose.
[01:59:52.161 --> 01:59:56.128]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:59:59.591 --> 02:00:02.033]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:00:02.233 --> 02:00:03.253]  Check it out today.
[02:00:03.714 --> 02:00:11.899]  I have set out to bring you the most hardcore, cutting-edge supplements and nutraceuticals bar none, and that's what you'll find at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:00:12.099 --> 02:00:22.966]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not of the very highest quality, or because they're not 100% organic, or because they don't
[02:00:23.046 --> 02:00:32.951]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited InfoWarsLife.com and believed in us and tried the products.
[02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:57.763]  Folks, check out InfoWarsLife.com today and the entire line of groundbreaking, cutting-edge, hardcore products.
[02:01:02.005 --> 02:01:04.626]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:15.543 --> 02:01:19.726]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:01:20.386 --> 02:01:21.186]  You want answers?
[02:01:21.967 --> 02:01:22.847]  Well, so does he.
[02:01:23.508 --> 02:01:27.130]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:27.710 --> 02:01:31.753]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:01:44.818 --> 02:01:48.741]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us for about 5-10 minutes in the next segment.
[02:01:49.842 --> 02:01:52.104]  Then I'm going to open the phones up to everybody and cover news.
[02:01:53.785 --> 02:01:57.428]  Immunologist admits babies only vaccinated to trained parents.
[02:01:58.769 --> 02:02:03.713]  Vaccine proponent acknowledges shots in first year of life for infants are pointless.
[02:02:03.793 --> 02:02:09.177]  Well yeah, a hepatitis shot, unless you're an intravenous drug user, or having unprotected sex, is pointless.
[02:02:10.998 --> 02:02:11.739]  Pointless.
[02:02:13.851 --> 02:02:14.051]  Yeah, uh...
[02:02:41.397 --> 02:02:51.183]  Alex, I keep hearing Phyllis say that vaccinations made in China are bad.
[02:02:51.704 --> 02:02:55.746]  However, vaccinations made in the USA are good.
[02:02:56.107 --> 02:02:57.908]  I wanted to confront her on this.
[02:02:58.408 --> 02:03:01.429]  I've emailed her a number of times.
[02:03:02.429 --> 02:03:14.773]  Another thing is, Reagan actually signed a bill, a vaccination injury act, that basically made the pharmaceutical companies immune to lawsuits.
[02:03:14.853 --> 02:03:15.213]  No, I know.
[02:03:15.233 --> 02:03:20.195]  The way they sold it to Reagan, and I'm not defending him, I said he had a lot of problems, was that this will pay families.
[02:03:20.635 --> 02:03:23.476]  And by then, when he was shot, he came out senile.
[02:03:24.196 --> 02:03:25.616]  They gave him, quote, cold blood.
[02:03:25.636 --> 02:03:27.017]  It'll brain damage you.
[02:03:27.777 --> 02:03:32.459]  And then reportedly they were drugging him and then getting him on speed to hype him back up to roll him out.
[02:03:33.020 --> 02:03:35.000]  Major psyops were going on with Reagan.
[02:03:35.020 --> 02:03:37.862]  That's what they tried to keep him from being president.
[02:03:38.562 --> 02:03:43.905]  The bottom line was he was speaking out against the New World Order, Trilateral Commission, everything when he was running.
[02:03:44.844 --> 02:03:47.647]  And then he did a lot of good stuff, had a commission to get rid of the IRS.
[02:03:48.308 --> 02:03:50.049]  Then he gets shot and a whole other thing happens.
[02:03:50.070 --> 02:03:50.790]  He was an old guy.
[02:03:51.851 --> 02:03:53.353]  But that's all ancient history.
[02:03:53.853 --> 02:03:59.559]  The point is, Phyllis Schlafly's been defending the Second Amendment, sovereignty, you name it, worked with Barry Goldwater.
[02:03:59.900 --> 02:04:00.981]  That's why we had her on.
[02:04:02.799 --> 02:04:06.320]  I wasn't aware of Phyllis's position on vaccines.
[02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:15.242]  We know pharmaceuticals from China are even worse and tainted across the board, but so are a lot of the vaccines made here or in other places.
[02:04:16.002 --> 02:04:20.684]  They say the best drugs come out of Austria or Germany.
[02:04:21.484 --> 02:04:23.824]  The most expensive pharmaceuticals come out of Austria.
[02:04:27.116 --> 02:04:36.224]  I know folks that have taken one prescription from China and got sick, and their doctor said, well, I'm going to give you something that costs three times more, it's from Austria, and it was a medical drug, and it really helped them.
[02:04:37.285 --> 02:04:39.426]  So I think there is something to that overall, but yeah.
[02:04:42.049 --> 02:04:42.449]  Anything else?
[02:04:42.549 --> 02:04:43.870]  Oh, you hung up, okay.
[02:04:43.970 --> 02:04:46.773]  James in Michigan, you want to talk about 60s activism, go ahead.
[02:04:47.994 --> 02:04:55.540]  Yes, I wanted to ask Phyllis if she was familiar with and perhaps worked alongside of Byron C. Fagan.
[02:04:56.738 --> 02:04:58.399]  Perhaps you know well of him.
[02:04:58.839 --> 02:05:02.001]  I just started learning of him and he's a very intriguing fellow.
[02:05:02.541 --> 02:05:06.503]  Unfortunately, I don't believe he's still alive to have him on your show.
[02:05:06.683 --> 02:05:09.324]  Yeah, there was Ezra Pound, Fagan.
[02:05:09.344 --> 02:05:11.365]  I never interviewed Fagan.
[02:05:11.385 --> 02:05:13.886]  I think he was gone or dead before I was even on air.
[02:05:13.906 --> 02:05:14.927]  I think he's been gone a long time.
[02:05:15.547 --> 02:05:21.290]  That was the Illuminati record that sold millions of copies made by Anthony Hilder.
[02:05:22.788 --> 02:05:31.655]  Anthony Hilder put that underground mega hit out in the late 60s out in Los Angeles.
[02:05:32.475 --> 02:05:35.658]  So yeah, you can find that record online on YouTube.
[02:05:36.418 --> 02:05:39.240]  And I mean, the voice of him is just hard to not listen to.
[02:05:39.841 --> 02:05:42.063]  The plan was nothing short of amazing.
[02:05:42.463 --> 02:05:43.404]  The Illuminati.
[02:05:44.564 --> 02:05:50.249]  I'd have to hear his voice to try to get it right, but it's like you listen to it and it's like, working with Adam Lysop,
[02:05:51.317 --> 02:05:56.344]  At Ingolstadt University in 1775, the plot was hatched and launched.
[02:05:57.305 --> 02:05:58.947]  But yes, I'm familiar with him.
[02:05:59.388 --> 02:06:01.331]  Alright, more calls coming up.
[02:06:01.691 --> 02:06:04.415]  Lawrence on Foster Children, Chris in Kentucky, Tim, many others.

[02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:10.521]  The experts are clear.
[02:06:10.841 --> 02:06:17.825]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[02:06:17.966 --> 02:06:24.210]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:24.230 --> 02:06:27.832]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[02:06:27.952 --> 02:06:31.854]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[02:06:32.175 --> 02:06:37.218]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:06:37.498 --> 02:06:38.398]  Not our iodine.
[02:06:38.498 --> 02:06:42.081]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[02:06:42.321 --> 02:06:44.662]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[02:07:09.707 --> 02:07:13.209]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:07:13.369 --> 02:07:17.332]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:07:17.652 --> 02:07:19.113]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:07:19.433 --> 02:07:27.018]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:07:27.278 --> 02:07:28.139]  But for how long?

[02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:34.703]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.

[02:07:36.944 --> 02:07:37.885]  Just won't quit.
[02:07:39.349 --> 02:07:49.475]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[02:07:49.915 --> 02:07:55.938]  Super Male Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:07:56.358 --> 02:07:58.599]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:07:58.700 --> 02:08:01.761]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[02:08:01.801 --> 02:08:08.665]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[02:08:09.264 --> 02:08:18.791]  Using unparalleled research and the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[02:08:18.931 --> 02:08:28.678]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[02:08:28.858 --> 02:08:31.780]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body.
[02:08:31.980 --> 02:08:32.601]  I think so.
[02:08:46.937 --> 02:08:47.197]  We're good.
[02:09:20.799 --> 02:09:25.964]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:09:26.464 --> 02:09:28.767]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:09:30.228 --> 02:09:32.950]  I see your hair is burning.
[02:09:33.311 --> 02:09:35.593]  Hills are filled with fire.
[02:09:36.214 --> 02:09:38.596]  Hills are filled with fire.
[02:09:39.076 --> 02:09:40.077]  If they say.
[02:09:41.018 --> 02:09:43.681]  If they say I never loved you.
[02:09:56.693 --> 02:10:00.434]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[02:10:01.514 --> 02:10:02.034]  to 2 p.m.
[02:10:02.074 --> 02:10:02.474]  Central.
[02:10:03.274 --> 02:10:06.315]  We're here live, broadcasting worldwide.
[02:10:08.315 --> 02:10:21.898]  Paul Watson's with us for the next segment, and I'm going right to Lawrence, Chris, Tim, Derek, Azriel, and others that are patiently holding the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:10:26.488 --> 02:10:32.934]  Recapping some of the news, great review by Daniel Taylor of Old Thinker News up on Infowars.com.
[02:10:35.616 --> 02:10:40.020]  Interstellar, a positive message for humanity at the crossroads of history.
[02:10:40.381 --> 02:10:42.643]  I'll give you my review of Interstellar tomorrow.
[02:10:42.903 --> 02:10:45.065]  Don't have time to do it today, but it's a great review.
[02:10:45.085 --> 02:10:46.606]  I agree with it.
[02:10:47.877 --> 02:10:53.161]  We're going to be getting into law lets IRS seize accounts on suspicion not crime.
[02:10:53.201 --> 02:10:54.282]  That's an article from last week.
[02:10:54.823 --> 02:11:01.128]  It dovetails with police use department wish list when deciding which assets to seize with no proof of crime.
[02:11:01.768 --> 02:11:06.252]  So just amazing criminality they're trying to imprint on police departments.
[02:11:06.852 --> 02:11:08.113]  Because I've done a study of it.
[02:11:08.174 --> 02:11:14.380]  Most departments do not engage in criminal asset forfeiture seizure even if they claim they can interpret a law to do it.
[02:11:14.681 --> 02:11:22.729]  They don't take your car because they claim they found cocaine residue on your money because everybody knows it's on all money unless it's brand new.
[02:11:24.031 --> 02:11:28.496]  Or they don't take your bar or restaurant because somebody sold drugs in the bathroom if it isn't you.
[02:11:30.298 --> 02:11:32.120]  But more and more departments are doing it.
[02:11:32.160 --> 02:11:32.941]  It's a minority.
[02:11:33.261 --> 02:11:34.622]  They're being federally trained to do it.
[02:11:34.682 --> 02:11:35.823]  It's very dangerous.
[02:11:36.584 --> 02:11:38.565]  So we're going to break that down out of the New York Times.
[02:11:39.266 --> 02:11:45.511]  We're going to get into federal judge says public has right to know about FBI's facial recognition database.
[02:11:45.931 --> 02:11:48.013]  Winston Churchill wanting to nuke Russia.
[02:11:48.773 --> 02:11:51.556]  Rush Limbaugh threatens to sue Democratic Congressional Committee.
[02:11:51.776 --> 02:11:52.637]  The big stories.
[02:11:52.657 --> 02:11:56.059]  I want to get Paul Watson's take on this after he covers his latest story.
[02:11:57.196 --> 02:12:00.778]  Obama says FCC should reclassify Internet as utility.
[02:12:01.258 --> 02:12:04.540]  Ted Cruz, who's been in the committee hearings, says what I've said.
[02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:07.521]  It is the Obamacare version of communications.
[02:12:08.201 --> 02:12:09.682]  Obamacare for the Internet.
[02:12:10.042 --> 02:12:11.483]  They call it one thing, it's another.
[02:12:12.183 --> 02:12:14.905]  And that integrates in with Obamacare architect.
[02:12:15.285 --> 02:12:20.688]  Lack of transparency, lying, was key on fooling, quote, stupid Americans.
[02:12:22.308 --> 02:12:23.429]  I mean, these people are sick.
[02:12:25.069 --> 02:12:28.251]  In fact, let's get to that first, Paul, because you wrote that article too this morning.
[02:12:28.712 --> 02:12:42.502]  How do these people go on C-SPAM with a bunch of academics and Obama people and laugh about lying, and laugh about increasing prices and lying about it, and laugh about charging healthy people, and of course, death panels, all of it.
[02:12:43.944 --> 02:12:48.047]  Why, if they're engaged in what is clearly, in my view, criminal activity,
[02:12:49.093 --> 02:12:49.553]  Fraud.
[02:12:50.394 --> 02:12:52.094]  Why tell people they did it later?
[02:12:52.114 --> 02:13:10.481]  I mean, I've studied criminology and I just never get why criminals or just sociopaths, scum, control freaks, nutbags, whatever you want to call them, gravitate towards power and then they start dancing around, hopping around, bragging how they're screwing everyone.
[02:13:10.681 --> 02:13:11.461]  Why do that?
[02:13:12.242 --> 02:13:13.642]  Why do they flap their mouths?
[02:13:13.702 --> 02:13:16.543]  I guess because they enjoy terrorizing those of us that are awake?
[02:13:16.983 --> 02:13:18.004]  What do you think is going on here, Paul?
[02:13:19.471 --> 02:13:28.838]  In the case of Gruber, I think it's partly, you know, he's a technocrat and he likes to think that he's smarter than 300 and odd million American people.
[02:13:28.898 --> 02:13:31.019]  So he thinks we're just too dumb to even understand him talking.
[02:13:33.001 --> 02:13:38.425]  Yeah, I mean, it's amazing when you watch that clip, just the hubris and the arrogance of it.
[02:13:38.945 --> 02:13:42.988]  Yeah, but I'll be honest, I want to slap him upside the head the whole time I look at him.
[02:13:44.690 --> 02:13:46.531]  Yeah, I mean, you know, he's a bureaucrat.
[02:13:46.551 --> 02:13:52.895]  He helped write Obamacare back in 2009, but, you know, Obama said, if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.
[02:13:53.376 --> 02:13:54.756]  That was another broken promise.
[02:13:55.017 --> 02:13:57.278]  Every single promise with Obamacare was broken.
[02:13:57.318 --> 02:14:10.006]  It wasn't a promise, it was already in the bill, premeditated fraud, saying, they're liars, there's no death panels, it doesn't increase prices, there's no hidden taxes, don't listen to the racists, Matt Drudge, Rush Limbaugh, Alex Jones.
[02:14:10.026 --> 02:14:12.908]  I mean, by name, we are racists, lying scum.
[02:14:13.188 --> 02:14:15.030]  No, we read the bill, Paul.
[02:14:15.090 --> 02:14:16.171]  I'm sorry I'm getting mad.
[02:14:16.431 --> 02:14:17.692]  I am sick of these people!
[02:14:19.914 --> 02:14:27.180]  It definitely makes you a little bit more angry when they get up afterwards and brazenly admit to the fact that they deceived everybody from the beginning.
[02:14:28.521 --> 02:14:29.802]  Is it that premeditation?
[02:14:31.423 --> 02:14:32.384]  In some cases, yeah.
[02:14:32.464 --> 02:14:41.432]  But in others, they just like to think that they're smarter than everyone else and that Obamacare is going to be great and it's going to save America, and they think they were right from the start, so they're not going to backtrack on that.
[02:14:42.233 --> 02:14:43.195]  Okay, I'm going to settle down.
[02:14:44.257 --> 02:14:47.163]  What do you make of saving the internet?
[02:14:47.584 --> 02:14:49.568]  Obama wants to take it over with the FCC.
[02:14:49.908 --> 02:14:51.091]  I told folks that was coming.
[02:14:51.131 --> 02:14:51.491]  Here it is.
[02:14:53.305 --> 02:15:07.494]  Well, I mean, you've got to remember that going back years, the Obama kill switch has been in the works for a very long time and they actually justified it at the time through Lieberman and everyone else by pointing to China as the example.
[02:15:07.534 --> 02:15:14.118]  Numerous times China has tried to register bloggers using their real names so they can be identified and targeted by the government.
[02:15:14.138 --> 02:15:14.378]  That's right.
[02:15:14.398 --> 02:15:25.113]  Lindsey Graham, McCain, Lieberman when he was in, and Democrats, Feinstein, have all pointed at China and said, see, they did it.
[02:15:25.373 --> 02:15:27.215]  Yeah, Mao killed 84 million people.
[02:15:27.356 --> 02:15:28.677]  Does that mean it's okay for you too?
[02:15:30.074 --> 02:15:30.454]  Exactly.
[02:15:30.474 --> 02:15:38.219]  And the reason China did it was to censor and strangle free speech at times of intense political uprising.
[02:15:38.619 --> 02:15:45.203]  So when the Tibetans were rising up, for example, a few years ago, that's when they shut off the internet in all these different areas.
[02:15:45.583 --> 02:15:53.507]  So they use it to stifle dissent and then Lieberman gets on air and says, we need this power because China uses it, so why shouldn't we have it?
[02:15:53.907 --> 02:15:58.370]  They use it to stifle freedom and for censorship because it is a communist police state.
[02:15:58.490 --> 02:16:01.639]  China has mobile execution vans and is a hellhole.
[02:16:01.679 --> 02:16:02.301]  You visited it.
[02:16:03.717 --> 02:16:04.778]  Yeah, on many occasions.
[02:16:06.059 --> 02:16:14.264]  The key with this latest thing is, though, that everybody thinks that Obama is, you know, winging his way in to save the Internet, to impose net neutrality.
[02:16:14.644 --> 02:16:17.406]  But again, I mean, look at their history of how they treat the Internet.
[02:16:17.766 --> 02:16:24.731]  You know, SOPA, PIPA, all these other bills that were introduced through Congress, they're not advocates for a free and open Internet.
[02:16:24.791 --> 02:16:27.773]  So to give them that level of power and control is ridiculous.
[02:16:27.793 --> 02:16:29.114]  Yeah, let's just make the announcement.
[02:16:29.932 --> 02:16:33.435]  World governments, governments worldwide are moving to censor the web.
[02:16:33.935 --> 02:16:36.617]  Australia calls it Chinese-style net censorship.
[02:16:36.878 --> 02:16:37.958]  The government called it that.
[02:16:38.179 --> 02:16:43.723]  They're moving to shut us down because they can't beat us in the intellectual arena of ideas.
[02:16:44.143 --> 02:16:45.364]  Do you understand, folks?
[02:16:45.805 --> 02:16:48.006]  That's why you get presidential alerts on your phone now.
[02:16:48.347 --> 02:16:50.028]  That's why they take over TV stations now.
[02:16:50.248 --> 02:16:51.689]  They're getting you ready for it.
[02:16:52.290 --> 02:16:52.490]  Paul?
[02:16:53.919 --> 02:17:05.022]  Yeah, and the danger of these corporations creating fast lanes and slow lanes is far less than the danger of the government having control over the entire World Wide Web, which is what they want.
[02:17:05.122 --> 02:17:07.702]  They've admitted to it on several occasions.
[02:17:08.162 --> 02:17:12.463]  You know, the basic facts of competition dictates that service will improve across the board.
[02:17:12.843 --> 02:17:13.824]  That's not going to happen.
[02:17:13.844 --> 02:17:16.404]  So, I mean, a lot of liberals are getting behind this, though.
[02:17:16.424 --> 02:17:19.005]  They've jumped right on board with Obama's comments today.
[02:17:19.665 --> 02:17:28.956]  Yeah, he's going to protect your healthcare by screwing you over, and now he's going to protect the internet with the same thing, which big corporations are behind in many cases, because it's all going to be selective.
[02:17:29.396 --> 02:17:29.877]  Incredible.
[02:17:29.917 --> 02:17:33.001]  Paul, let's shift gears to your newest article on InfoWars.com.
[02:17:33.601 --> 02:17:36.685]  Very interesting information.
[02:17:36.745 --> 02:17:38.727]  Let's get into what this
[02:17:40.603 --> 02:17:49.924]  Scientist is saying immunologist, that's a medical doctor who specializes in vaccines and immune systems, what they admitted but didn't want their name released in the video.
[02:17:51.072 --> 02:18:13.369]  Yeah, it's basically a PhD immunologist, a vaccine advocate, who gets up before a panel of health professionals at this medical conference and admits to the fact that vaccines for babies in the first year, which babies in America receive at least 26 vaccines recommended, unless you go jump through, you know, flaming hoops and opt out of it.
[02:18:13.389 --> 02:18:15.631]  26 vaccines in the first year.
[02:18:16.071 --> 02:18:18.613]  So this immunologist gets up and basically admits that
[02:18:19.133 --> 02:18:21.895]  Because a baby's immune system isn't even developed by then.
[02:18:21.935 --> 02:18:24.316]  They get the immunity through the breast milk mainly.
[02:18:24.777 --> 02:18:28.839]  These vaccines are completely pointless, worthless for the first year.
[02:18:28.879 --> 02:18:29.840]  They have no effect.
[02:18:30.180 --> 02:18:37.424]  And that what it's really about is training the parents to bring their babies to pediatric wellness visits.
[02:18:37.584 --> 02:18:41.707]  Yeah, that's what the wellness checks and all of it is, but they're only telling you half the story.
[02:18:42.617 --> 02:18:51.727]  It's to induct them in, damage their immune system, compromise them, attack their blood-brain barrier, and give them an IQ reduction that the White House Science Czar wrote about in 1974.
[02:18:53.929 --> 02:18:58.234]  Well, you've got studies from 2011 which I cite in this article.
[02:18:58.575 --> 02:19:02.199]  Infant mortality rates regressed against number of vaccine doses routinely given.
[02:19:02.873 --> 02:19:11.940]  And it basically documents the fact that the countries with the least vaccines for babies also have the least infant mortality.
[02:19:12.260 --> 02:19:16.923]  So Sweden and Japan give the least vaccines to infants up to one years of age.
[02:19:17.304 --> 02:19:19.905]  They have the least, the lowest infant mortality rate.
[02:19:20.766 --> 02:19:26.570]  Guess who has the highest number of vaccines given to babies and the highest infant mortality rate?
[02:19:26.590 --> 02:19:27.211]  USA, baby!
[02:19:29.241 --> 02:19:31.722]  6.2 infant deaths per 1,000 births.
[02:19:32.282 --> 02:19:34.743]  And you can compare these two charts.
[02:19:35.384 --> 02:19:40.646]  Vaccines, number of vaccines compared to infant mortality, and they almost exactly correlate.
[02:19:40.746 --> 02:19:49.530]  And again, they're not trying to kill the kid outright, as folks would notice, but when you bust a cap in somebody's cerebral cortex 20-something times in the first year, 40-something times in 18 months,
[02:19:50.811 --> 02:19:55.296]  You're gonna get an overcooked op, and that's why most of the kids with autism are fine to 18 months.
[02:19:55.596 --> 02:19:57.399]  They go on to the next round, and hey, it's done.
[02:19:57.479 --> 02:20:01.303]  The bell bings, the brain's gone, and the black op's been successful.
[02:20:01.924 --> 02:20:05.868]  And I'm sorry for everybody out there, but parents don't want to listen, so go ahead, murder your children.
[02:20:05.908 --> 02:20:06.509]  Government loves it.
[02:20:08.228 --> 02:20:16.057]  And on autism, of course, Dr. Andrew Wakefield was demonized for over a decade for making that connection between MMR vaccine and autism.
[02:20:16.478 --> 02:20:27.130]  Well, there's a new study that's confirmed it, shows that increases in autism rates are linked to the introduction of vaccines manufactured using human fetal cell lines from aborted babies.
[02:20:27.210 --> 02:20:38.859]  A scientist at the CDC went public who wrote the document they use to go after Wakefield and others and admitted they were basically told the lie and it's a fraud and it is brain damaging, especially boys.
[02:20:39.160 --> 02:20:39.380]  Why?
[02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:41.822]  Because our blood-brain barrier isn't as strong as girls.
[02:20:43.439 --> 02:20:43.799]  Exactly.
[02:20:43.839 --> 02:20:47.421]  So, he was castigated for over a decade for making that connection.
[02:20:47.821 --> 02:20:53.565]  Now, another peer-reviewed study in the Journal of Public Health and Epidemiology confirms that connection.
[02:20:53.605 --> 02:20:54.385]  Paul, it's important.
[02:20:54.405 --> 02:20:55.446]  Let's do one more segment.
[02:20:55.466 --> 02:20:59.888]  Bottom of the hour, we're going to go to Lawrence, Chris, Tim, Derek, Azriel, and others.
[02:21:00.428 --> 02:21:01.509]  Folks, don't listen to us.
[02:21:01.569 --> 02:21:04.350]  In the case of fairness, trust the government.
[02:21:04.651 --> 02:21:07.912]  Give your children hundreds of shots, and you can bury them.
[02:21:09.053 --> 02:21:14.897]  This winter, next to water and food, you need a safe, storable fuel supply for your preparedness needs.
[02:21:14.917 --> 02:21:16.537]  Spare fuel is the answer.
[02:21:16.838 --> 02:21:24.862]  Unlike gasoline, spare fuel can be safely stored with your other supplies for many years and works in any gas-powered vehicle or backup generator.
[02:21:25.163 --> 02:21:30.586]  With the bitterly cold temperatures predicted for this winter, now is the best time to stock up on spare fuel.
[02:21:30.866 --> 02:21:33.267]  So, go to GetSpareFuel.com.
[02:21:33.467 --> 02:21:35.349]  That's GetSpareFuel.com.

[02:21:40.310 --> 02:21:43.631]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[02:21:43.751 --> 02:21:45.312]  Good thing we have the Berkey System.
[02:21:45.412 --> 02:21:47.173]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[02:21:47.373 --> 02:21:52.856]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[02:21:53.216 --> 02:21:53.956]  I know, right?
[02:21:54.036 --> 02:21:54.977]  You love it, too!
[02:21:55.357 --> 02:21:56.658]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[02:21:56.798 --> 02:21:57.698]  Let's go get some.

[02:23:37.649 --> 02:23:40.230]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.

[02:24:08.456 --> 02:24:10.518]  Mike Stenerson from Midas Resources.
[02:24:10.738 --> 02:24:13.880]  At no time in history have precious metals been more important.
[02:24:14.060 --> 02:24:16.542]  Certainly not in my 22 years in the industry.
[02:24:16.802 --> 02:24:20.484]  The dollar has lost over 90% of its value in the last 60 years.
[02:24:20.745 --> 02:24:24.227]  No fiat currency has ever survived the government printing presses.
[02:24:24.507 --> 02:24:25.608]  Ours is not immune.
[02:24:25.928 --> 02:24:27.549]  The time is now to be proactive.
[02:24:27.569 --> 02:24:28.130]  1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[02:24:32.893 --> 02:24:35.214]  Anything tied to the dollar is at risk.
[02:24:35.594 --> 02:24:40.016]  CDs, annuities, 401Ks, IRAs, stocks, bonds, you name it.
[02:24:40.116 --> 02:24:40.956]  So decide.
[02:24:41.197 --> 02:24:44.318]  Do you want to leave a legacy of wealth or debt for your family?
[02:24:44.538 --> 02:24:45.498]  The choice is yours.
[02:24:45.838 --> 02:24:46.779]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[02:24:46.919 --> 02:24:47.959]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 116.
[02:24:48.059 --> 02:24:49.060]  Be proactive, not reactive.
[02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:49.260]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:25:02.045 --> 02:25:15.170]  I'm going to be honest with you, Alex Jones here back live.
[02:25:15.450 --> 02:25:20.452]  The reason I get real sarcastic and surly is it's a coping strategy.
[02:25:20.492 --> 02:25:21.373]  I don't do it on purpose.
[02:25:24.793 --> 02:25:28.494]  I physically get angry when I know they're giving people vaccines to brain damage them.
[02:25:28.894 --> 02:25:31.935]  And the doctors and nurses are in denial because they're not murdering killers.
[02:25:32.396 --> 02:25:33.816]  That's how compartmentalization works.
[02:25:33.836 --> 02:25:36.497]  They believe the hype they're putting out.
[02:25:38.078 --> 02:25:44.460]  And they'll always, when I see them on the street or they email me, they'll go, the science of immunology is very well known.
[02:25:44.520 --> 02:25:45.740]  You didn't go to Harvard.
[02:25:45.800 --> 02:25:50.902]  Actually, I've argued like five times with a Harvard doctor who's connected to my family.
[02:25:50.922 --> 02:25:51.622]  I'll just leave it at that.
[02:25:52.202 --> 02:25:53.103]  And as a pediatrician.
[02:25:54.372 --> 02:25:56.754]  And I'll start saying, well, what about all the secret testing?
[02:25:56.774 --> 02:25:57.775]  What about all the contamination?
[02:25:57.815 --> 02:26:02.260]  What about all the admissions that the swine flu shots in the 70s killed thousands of people?
[02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:06.303]  What about, and they just kept, I don't want to hear it, you're not a medical doctor.
[02:26:06.323 --> 02:26:10.287]  And I'm like, I've interviewed hundreds of them, literally.
[02:26:11.268 --> 02:26:12.689]  I've got all the medical reports.
[02:26:12.709 --> 02:26:13.870]  I can read these.
[02:26:15.672 --> 02:26:17.113]  I can read the infant mortality.
[02:26:18.149 --> 02:26:28.233]  Everybody I talked to that's got an autistic boy, at 18 months they got the third round of shots, they had a convulsion on the way home or that night, and they never talked again!
[02:26:28.253 --> 02:26:30.654]  Do you understand?
[02:26:32.275 --> 02:26:34.396]  But they just will not admit they've been doing this.
[02:26:34.436 --> 02:26:36.457]  See, that's how the Nazis were.
[02:26:36.517 --> 02:26:44.120]  Most of them didn't think they were bad, they thought they were doing good, and as stuff got more and more evil, they had already signed on, so they just went along with it.
[02:26:46.022 --> 02:26:53.348]  I wish there were high-tech vaccines that have been double-tested, that had liability, that they'd tell you the dangers and you'd make the choice.
[02:26:54.249 --> 02:26:55.530]  I would probably get some of them.
[02:26:57.512 --> 02:26:58.653]  But not from these people.
[02:26:59.073 --> 02:27:00.754]  It's like saying, are you against hamburgers?
[02:27:01.015 --> 02:27:08.281]  Well, there's a place where 50 people have died in one year from food poisoning, and you're like, let's get hamburgers from this place, and I'm like, no, no, no!
[02:27:08.301 --> 02:27:10.923]  They're like, what, you don't like hamburgers?
[02:27:11.924 --> 02:27:14.506]  No, man, there's something in those burgers, okay?
[02:27:16.067 --> 02:27:16.827]  They're not good.
[02:27:16.927 --> 02:27:24.290]  And then we know the troops have been given the anthrax shots three different times, killed whole groups of them, till the doctors at the bases wouldn't give them.
[02:27:24.670 --> 02:27:27.271]  They'd court-martial people, but they'd still stand their ground.
[02:27:27.311 --> 02:27:28.392]  They'd drop the court-martial.
[02:27:28.952 --> 02:27:30.532]  The officers aren't getting the shots.
[02:27:31.773 --> 02:27:35.074]  Joe Biggs used to get ordered, his staff sergeant, order his men to take it.
[02:27:35.434 --> 02:27:36.075]  He'd have to take it.
[02:27:36.615 --> 02:27:40.076]  And the higher-ups would not take it, and laugh at him, and just say, that's the way it is, Joe.
[02:27:40.616 --> 02:27:42.197]  Sergeant, get your butt out there and do it.
[02:27:43.942 --> 02:27:45.964]  I've been told that by military across the board.
[02:27:47.066 --> 02:27:48.127]  They know, okay?
[02:27:48.387 --> 02:27:49.649]  People know they're bad!
[02:27:50.069 --> 02:27:50.610]  I'm ranting.
[02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:55.356]  I want to play the clip of the immunologist at this meeting getting up and saying this.
[02:27:55.396 --> 02:27:57.558]  The video's up on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:27:57.878 --> 02:27:58.439]  Here's the clip.
[02:27:58.960 --> 02:28:00.602]  The science seems fairly clear.
[02:28:01.428 --> 02:28:11.710]  That for the first year of life probably the immunization is not stimulating the kind of response that we expected to stimulate.
[02:28:11.971 --> 02:28:16.112]  So what's the rationale for continuing to do that if it's not doing what it's supposed to do?
[02:28:16.412 --> 02:28:25.874]  The vaccines are given at pediatric wellness visits and the idea is that you are training a parent to bring their child in
[02:28:26.924 --> 02:28:27.904]  And by the way, let's stop there.
[02:28:27.964 --> 02:28:30.645]  What she's saying, again this is compartmentalized.
[02:28:43.953 --> 02:28:45.414]  What they're saying is partially true.
[02:28:45.454 --> 02:28:49.676]  That's why the kids don't get as much brain damage until 18 months, when the immune system actually kicks in.
[02:28:50.056 --> 02:28:55.378]  Then they have an autoimmune, hemorrhagic almost response, is what I've heard described of, in the brain.
[02:28:56.078 --> 02:29:07.723]  An autoimmune storm, blood on the brain, and the cops come, and there's blood coming out, you're 18 month old, they're gonna arrest you, and you don't blame the cops, they come, nose coming out the baby's, what'd you do to your kid?
[02:29:08.004 --> 02:29:10.545]  The hospital then won't admit it's the vaccine, even though they know.
[02:29:10.845 --> 02:29:12.926]  They'll tell the officers, they must have shook this kid.
[02:29:13.888 --> 02:29:14.888]  You're going in handcuffs.
[02:29:14.928 --> 02:29:19.130]  Now, since this quietly came out in court the last 20 years, they don't do that as much.
[02:29:19.670 --> 02:29:22.291]  Because the cops now won't call for an indictment because they know.
[02:29:23.411 --> 02:29:26.912]  I tell you, Paul, closing out in the last two minutes, this is so sinister.
[02:29:26.952 --> 02:29:28.833]  It makes me so angry.
[02:29:29.393 --> 02:29:32.674]  And I was talking to a lady I know that's pregnant right now, and she's going to get shots for the baby.
[02:29:33.034 --> 02:29:35.354]  She goes, I've read the literature, but I'm still so scared.
[02:29:35.374 --> 02:29:37.415]  And I got the flu shot even though I'm pregnant.
[02:29:37.715 --> 02:29:40.536]  When we know that's the only thing that probably could hurt her baby, Paul.
[02:29:40.556 --> 02:29:42.677]  I mean, we have the medical science.
[02:29:42.757 --> 02:29:43.257]  We know.
[02:29:44.585 --> 02:29:48.846]  Well, I mean, at least know what you're injecting yourself with, or your child.
[02:29:48.906 --> 02:30:01.030]  I mean, NHS government hospitals in Britain, if you've got so much as a cut, they force you to take a tetanus jab, and you say to them, I had a friend who this happened to recently, and, you know, you say, what is that?
[02:30:01.070 --> 02:30:02.350]  And they say, just take it.
[02:30:02.430 --> 02:30:07.792]  And then it turns out later it's got five different vaccines in it, and they don't even tell you what's in it when they force it upon you.
[02:30:08.132 --> 02:30:12.794]  You know, we've got a mainstream media that says, Mercury helps, not harms children.
[02:30:14.194 --> 02:30:19.378]  Anybody on the planet Earth, even a layman, knows that mercury causes brain damage.
[02:30:19.418 --> 02:30:21.560]  That's where the term mad as a hatter came from.
[02:30:21.940 --> 02:30:25.223]  Because in England in the 18th century, they made felt for top hats.
[02:30:26.044 --> 02:30:27.625]  It was contaminated with mercury.
[02:30:27.885 --> 02:30:28.946]  They got dementia.
[02:30:29.046 --> 02:30:30.827]  That's where mad as a hatter comes from.
[02:30:31.228 --> 02:30:35.571]  But now the mainstream media says it's healthy for kids when we know it causes brain damage.
[02:30:36.071 --> 02:30:38.033]  So in that environment, just be informed.
[02:30:38.073 --> 02:30:40.215]  Know what you're injecting yourself and your child with.
[02:30:40.695 --> 02:30:41.975]  That's right, absolutely.
[02:30:42.035 --> 02:30:47.237]  And the doctors and nurses are committed to this evil, and they're trying to stop it, some of them, from getting targeted.
[02:30:47.457 --> 02:30:49.558]  They make them take it, or they fire them.
[02:30:50.198 --> 02:30:55.999]  I mean, it's just outrageous totalitarianism, and now they're giving flu shots to kids everywhere without parental consent.
[02:30:56.359 --> 02:30:56.880]  Paul, great job.
[02:30:56.900 --> 02:30:57.940]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:30:57.960 --> 02:30:58.940]  We're going to come back in a moment.
[02:30:59.000 --> 02:30:59.700]  We're on the march.
[02:31:00.220 --> 02:31:01.821]  The empire's on the run.
[02:31:02.761 --> 02:31:05.442]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:09.640 --> 02:31:12.083]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:31:12.283 --> 02:31:13.305]  Check it out today.
[02:31:13.785 --> 02:31:21.975]  I have set out to bring you the most hardcore, cutting-edge supplements and nutraceuticals bar none, and that's what you'll find at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:31:22.176 --> 02:31:28.123]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not
[02:31:28.343 --> 02:31:28.563]  Of course!
[02:31:50.083 --> 02:31:50.624]  We're good.
[02:32:09.671 --> 02:32:11.352]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[02:32:11.672 --> 02:32:15.434]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[02:32:16.194 --> 02:32:20.517]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[02:32:20.657 --> 02:32:27.460]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[02:32:27.960 --> 02:32:37.045]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:32:37.265 --> 02:32:42.688]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[02:32:42.808 --> 02:32:50.072]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.
[02:32:50.393 --> 02:32:52.674]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:32:52.974 --> 02:32:58.097]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the Info War.

[02:33:10.060 --> 02:33:15.461]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:33:16.701 --> 02:33:21.462]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:33:21.842 --> 02:33:23.603]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[02:33:25.922 --> 02:33:28.644]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:33:30.566 --> 02:33:32.668]  They sow pride in every stitch.
[02:33:34.630 --> 02:33:36.952]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:33:39.068 --> 02:33:50.613]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:33:50.873 --> 02:33:52.374]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:33:52.654 --> 02:33:55.215]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:33:55.535 --> 02:33:59.597]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[02:33:59.617 --> 02:34:01.798]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:34:02.158 --> 02:34:04.339]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:34:04.859 --> 02:34:06.300]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:34:06.440 --> 02:34:06.900]  Got it.
[02:34:07.240 --> 02:34:08.041]  Others don't.
[02:34:10.063 --> 02:34:15.126]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.
[02:34:16.086 --> 02:34:17.687]  Government is the problem.
[02:34:20.608 --> 02:34:27.392]  From time to time, we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule.
[02:34:28.312 --> 02:34:35.436]  That government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people.
[02:34:36.365 --> 02:34:38.066]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:34:38.487 --> 02:34:41.429]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:34:42.850 --> 02:34:51.898]  You have to understand, ladies and gentlemen, I have interviewed, you've heard them, long-term listeners.
[02:34:52.278 --> 02:34:54.060]  Let's not exaggerate.
[02:34:54.080 --> 02:34:56.242]  50, 60 virologists on vaccines.
[02:35:00.807 --> 02:35:15.476]  Probably that many genetic engineers, vaccine makers, geneticists, medical doctors, brain surgeons, epidemiologists, scientists, allergists, pharmacists.
[02:35:15.937 --> 02:35:17.158]  My dad's a physician.
[02:35:19.719 --> 02:35:27.845]  Until five years ago, all the inserts said, and it was just, absolutely do never give a pregnant woman a vaccine.
[02:35:28.949 --> 02:35:43.881]  It causes a laundry list of disorders and brain damage and miscarriages and now they push multiple, every pregnant woman I know, every time they go in for a checkup, they go, flu shot, flu shot, and they get them!
[02:35:45.482 --> 02:35:47.204]  And they come back a month later, they go, get another one!
[02:35:48.064 --> 02:35:48.785]  And they go, but I just had one.
[02:35:48.805 --> 02:35:51.227]  It doesn't matter, honey, you need this, you don't want that baby to die.
[02:35:51.627 --> 02:35:53.169]  You get the flu, you can lose that baby.
[02:35:53.969 --> 02:35:55.751]  And it's so diabolical, the nurse,
[02:35:57.113 --> 02:35:58.514]  It's like a ghoul killer!
[02:35:59.514 --> 02:36:02.855]  But it's so compartmentalized, if their boss told them, it must be okay now.
[02:36:03.035 --> 02:36:09.978]  And you'll say to the nurses, I know nurses, I'll go, but you know just a few years ago, they go, I know, but they make us take a whole bunch now.
[02:36:10.078 --> 02:36:10.918]  That's like the military.
[02:36:11.259 --> 02:36:14.380]  They give them a shot, oh, we didn't have a record, do another, do another.
[02:36:14.660 --> 02:36:16.381]  Hundreds of shots a year in some cases.
[02:36:20.382 --> 02:36:24.884]  Everyone I know who was in the military had people in their unit
[02:36:25.523 --> 02:36:31.928]  Who were hospitalized and then or brain damaged or have narcolepsy, epilepsy, wheelchair or dead.
[02:36:33.369 --> 02:36:41.315]  Everyone I know knows people that ended up in wheelchairs from vaccines in the military.
[02:36:41.575 --> 02:36:43.377]  Did you just hear what I said?
[02:36:46.368 --> 02:36:49.831]  And all of you listening have those stories, and all of you know that.
[02:36:50.231 --> 02:36:57.037]  All of you got a neighbor whose kid was fine one week, and you're playing with them when they're 18 months old, and now they're in a, you know, drooling in the corner.
[02:36:59.098 --> 02:37:00.700]  But see, the whole system's in on it.
[02:37:01.080 --> 02:37:02.201]  That's how this stuff works.
[02:37:03.502 --> 02:37:07.925]  Like, everybody knows the government ships in most drugs, but the police-state drug war goes on.
[02:37:09.366 --> 02:37:11.448]  Everybody knows the Federal Reserve launders the drug money.
[02:37:11.688 --> 02:37:13.189]  It's come out in the news hundreds of times.
[02:37:13.410 --> 02:37:13.730]  Hundreds!
[02:37:14.130 --> 02:37:14.931]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[02:37:16.260 --> 02:37:17.340]  I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[02:37:22.683 --> 02:37:24.684]  I have someone I've known for seven years.
[02:37:26.264 --> 02:37:27.845]  They've worked with me and for me.
[02:37:28.765 --> 02:37:29.666]  They say they respect me.
[02:37:29.766 --> 02:37:30.146]  I like them.
[02:37:30.166 --> 02:37:30.786]  They're nice people.
[02:37:30.846 --> 02:37:31.266]  I trust them.
[02:37:32.627 --> 02:37:33.407]  And they're having a baby.
[02:37:34.588 --> 02:37:37.529]  And she's gotten a flu shot, and they're going to give the baby shots.
[02:37:38.450 --> 02:37:42.651]  And no amount of medical literature, no amount of... They don't have an immune system.
[02:37:42.691 --> 02:37:43.772]  They get it from your colostrum.
[02:37:45.768 --> 02:37:49.631]  And I talk to women, they don't even believe me that the baby needs breast milk.
[02:37:49.792 --> 02:37:52.514]  They don't even know it has the vaccines in it, the natural ones.
[02:37:52.734 --> 02:37:54.216]  I mean, I just can't deal with it anymore.
[02:37:54.396 --> 02:38:00.081]  I mean, you've got the Obama people on TV saying, we lied to you, we screwed you, we robbed you.
[02:38:01.542 --> 02:38:04.265]  Like a witch in a movie cackling at you.
[02:38:04.545 --> 02:38:05.926]  I'll get you and your little dog too.
[02:38:06.186 --> 02:38:07.908]  What does it take?
[02:38:12.600 --> 02:38:18.306]  I see pregnant women on the street, at the gym, on an elevator, I say something.
[02:38:18.486 --> 02:38:24.612]  And I'll be going to dinner with my family, and my parents, you name it, or anybody, they'll just go, okay Alex, just go ahead.
[02:38:25.252 --> 02:38:30.778]  Because I'll see a family sitting down, a woman's pregnant, I'll go, I gotta go to the bathroom, and they'll go, yeah, yeah, yeah, we know you do.
[02:38:32.287 --> 02:38:33.748]  And it's not because I'm some hero.
[02:38:34.008 --> 02:38:36.170]  There's people who want to kill that woman's baby!
[02:38:36.510 --> 02:38:38.331]  And I'm not going to sit here and take it!
[02:38:38.992 --> 02:38:43.775]  And let me tell you, this is a normal response, ladies and gentlemen, to all this criminal weirdness.
[02:38:48.919 --> 02:38:53.442]  This is a normal response to all of the criminal weirdness.
[02:38:55.117 --> 02:39:05.040]  It was the abolitionists that thought humans being held in pins and made to drag plows like donkeys and horses was wrong, and people thought they were crazy.
[02:39:05.460 --> 02:39:06.121]  Well, let me tell you something.
[02:39:06.321 --> 02:39:08.121]  I'm not crazy, and I'm no hero either.
[02:39:08.662 --> 02:39:15.604]  I know when evil's going on to other people at a fundamental spiritual level and at a DNA level, it's happening to me!
[02:39:17.133 --> 02:39:17.973]  And my kids!
[02:39:18.553 --> 02:39:19.494]  None of us are safe!
[02:39:20.334 --> 02:39:22.235]  And they're coming with the forced inoculations now.
[02:39:22.455 --> 02:39:23.475]  They're pushing them everywhere.
[02:39:23.715 --> 02:39:26.876]  And I'm telling you folks, all of you that go along with the system are crazy!
[02:39:28.737 --> 02:39:32.618]  There's this thing in weak people that they imagine because they go along, they've got power.
[02:39:32.898 --> 02:39:34.099]  Because they're with the system.
[02:39:35.259 --> 02:39:40.581]  That'd be like a gazelle not running from a lion and thinking it had won because it ran up to the lion and laid down.
[02:39:42.648 --> 02:39:45.691]  No, the gazelle that runs away is the one that's smart.
[02:39:45.951 --> 02:39:54.959]  Of course, you got the warthogs in Africa, where you'll see like 10 of them chase the lion down and actually run up a side with its tusk and cut its guts open.
[02:39:55.279 --> 02:39:57.801]  So most of the time, lions don't mess with warthogs.
[02:39:59.322 --> 02:40:04.507]  Even though they're little, weigh about 100 pounds, the big ones, they'll fight.
[02:40:06.977 --> 02:40:08.278]  And see, I'm not a gazelle, folks.
[02:40:08.338 --> 02:40:09.678]  I'm not gonna sit here and get attacked.
[02:40:09.698 --> 02:40:10.319]  You understand that?
[02:40:11.099 --> 02:40:12.480]  I get very angry.
[02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:23.525]  As a normal mammal, I get in a you-know-what mode when I sit here and I look at this all day and I'm sick of these people declaring they're my enemy and pissing all over me and excuse my French.
[02:40:23.786 --> 02:40:24.666]  I'm sick of them!
[02:40:24.886 --> 02:40:25.747]  I'm tired of them!
[02:40:25.907 --> 02:40:30.189]  And I want the trance, the spell that America's under to be broken!
[02:40:33.674 --> 02:40:39.579]  Lawrence, Chris, Tim, Derek, Azriel, I'm gonna go to all of you.
[02:40:39.599 --> 02:40:41.060]  Lawrence, go ahead from Montana.
[02:40:41.080 --> 02:40:41.680]  Thanks for holding.
[02:40:42.861 --> 02:40:51.368]  Okay, well Alex, I called to say thank you for having Phyllis Schlafly on and thank you for everything you do.
[02:40:51.548 --> 02:40:52.428]  No, please don't thank me.
[02:40:52.448 --> 02:40:53.509]  We're under attack here, brother.
[02:40:54.350 --> 02:40:56.551]  It's like thanking a warthog for attacking a lion.
[02:40:57.132 --> 02:40:59.494]  The lion comes running out of the bushes to eat us, we gotta fight!
[02:41:00.390 --> 02:41:00.750]  Go ahead.
[02:41:00.850 --> 02:41:03.631]  You know, I said I was going to talk about foster children.
[02:41:03.751 --> 02:41:05.272]  I don't know if I had the stomach for it.
[02:41:05.992 --> 02:41:06.552]  No, go ahead.
[02:41:06.592 --> 02:41:07.512]  Talk about foster kids.
[02:41:07.552 --> 02:41:07.892]  Go ahead.
[02:41:08.033 --> 02:41:19.696]  But let me, you know, it was a few years ago, Mother Teresa spoke before a national prayer breakfast and, you know, she said, if you want peace, stop killing your children.
[02:41:19.716 --> 02:41:20.837]  Do you remember that?
[02:41:20.977 --> 02:41:21.217]  Yes.
[02:41:22.757 --> 02:41:24.538]  And who was, who was over there?
[02:41:26.497 --> 02:41:32.242]  Clinton and Gore and their wives sitting on their hands while she received a standing ovation.
[02:41:36.505 --> 02:41:37.186]  I remember that.
[02:41:37.226 --> 02:41:38.127]  It shows the evil.
[02:41:38.367 --> 02:41:41.290]  If we won't protect children, none of us are safe.
[02:41:41.330 --> 02:41:43.391]  If we don't value humanity, then who are we?
[02:41:43.531 --> 02:41:44.793]  We're saying we're garbage.
[02:41:44.813 --> 02:41:45.833]  Well, I'm not garbage.
[02:41:46.054 --> 02:41:46.814]  You're not garbage.
[02:41:47.035 --> 02:41:48.035]  Our children aren't garbage.
[02:41:48.055 --> 02:41:49.617]  I don't care what color they are.
[02:41:52.785 --> 02:42:02.973]  The last time through the court, there is a judge here, a local county, awarded a grandfather who has a sexual predator history and a drug sales history.
[02:42:03.894 --> 02:42:09.438]  The... and he's our foster child, so she gets to go to him.
[02:42:09.558 --> 02:42:13.061]  And I learn in court, he has another wife.
[02:42:13.681 --> 02:42:15.263]  Yes, you heard me correctly.
[02:42:15.963 --> 02:42:21.848]  He's got a 20-something wife living in the same trailer home with two children, preschoolers,
[02:42:22.495 --> 02:42:28.117]  Who are now this former foster child's aunt and uncle at two and three, and it doesn't stop there.
[02:42:28.137 --> 02:42:36.040]  And none of the four attorneys, including the guardian, Ed Lightham, or the county attorney, had no objections.
[02:42:37.240 --> 02:42:41.842]  It's, Alex, and people listening, it's a theater of the absurd.
[02:42:44.102 --> 02:42:44.462]  It is.
[02:42:44.522 --> 02:42:49.485]  The society is just degenerating, and it's because we don't value human life that it's come to this.
[02:42:49.505 --> 02:42:50.466]  Thank you so much, Lawrence.
[02:42:50.946 --> 02:42:52.867]  Tim in Florida, thanks for holding your on the air.
[02:42:52.887 --> 02:42:54.888]  Hi, Alex.
[02:42:55.148 --> 02:42:59.011]  I really enjoyed listening to Phyllis Schlafly on your program today.
[02:42:59.031 --> 02:43:07.215]  I can remember listening to her when I was a young boy, and I'm in my 60s now, so she's still the same as she's always been.
[02:43:08.176 --> 02:43:09.937]  I saw work for freedom.
[02:43:10.715 --> 02:43:18.079]  I wanted to follow up on what she said about the open borders, even in spite of created crises like Ebola.
[02:43:18.740 --> 02:43:25.264]  There was an article out in Ghana yesterday, if I could read a couple of sentences from that.
[02:43:25.984 --> 02:43:34.149]  Heads of state and government of ECOWAS, and Alex, ECOWAS is the Economic Community of West African States, a sub-region of the African Union.
[02:43:35.157 --> 02:43:42.119]  They have allayed fears that the Ebola outbreak could disrupt the free movement of goods and people in the sub-region.
[02:43:42.779 --> 02:43:51.282]  The leaders underlined their commitment to ECOWAS principles of free movement in spite of the outbreak of the disease in some member countries.
[02:43:51.662 --> 02:43:53.383]  So it doesn't matter to them.
[02:43:53.883 --> 02:43:56.424]  Free trade is sank or sank.
[02:43:57.324 --> 02:44:00.025]  And it's not just free trade in and of itself.
[02:44:00.467 --> 02:44:04.929]  It's that free trade is the entry level towards regional jurisdictions.
[02:44:05.109 --> 02:44:05.449]  That's right.
[02:44:05.469 --> 02:44:16.573]  They have to keep it open because then it would repudiate the regional jurisdiction, which trumps the national and state jurisdiction, which is a way of conquering the sub-regions without firing a shot.
[02:44:17.393 --> 02:44:19.774]  And look, we are talking to medical doctors.
[02:44:20.414 --> 02:44:24.716]  We went up to Dallas to actually check into the hospitals, interview the people this weekend.
[02:44:24.756 --> 02:44:25.696]  Anthony Gooch, you already did.
[02:44:28.456 --> 02:44:32.478]  There is clearly what people believe is Ebola deaths going on, and it's being covered up.
[02:44:33.238 --> 02:44:33.698]  No kidding.
[02:44:33.758 --> 02:44:36.940]  Flights are coming with folks dying on the plane, vomiting and bleeding everywhere.
[02:44:36.960 --> 02:44:39.661]  And I'm not saying it's a huge outbreak or something.
[02:44:39.721 --> 02:44:40.342]  I hope it isn't.
[02:44:40.362 --> 02:44:44.083]  But they're clearly covering it up, and that sets the precedent for cover-ups.
[02:44:44.223 --> 02:44:45.404]  And I'm just sitting here.
[02:44:45.444 --> 02:44:52.767]  It's so surreal to have the doctors' names, to have gone to the hospitals and interviewed them, and to have some of them by name on the show.
[02:44:52.807 --> 02:44:53.768]  We're going to get them back on.
[02:44:55.148 --> 02:44:58.729]  Dr. Lorenzi, but this is just a really serious situation.
[02:44:59.649 --> 02:45:04.531]  Well, yeah, and again, it's just one of a number of created crises.
[02:45:04.611 --> 02:45:05.751]  It's a two-fold thing.
[02:45:05.811 --> 02:45:13.193]  Not only do they further integrate these blocks, but the crisis serves as the reason for integrating.
[02:45:13.213 --> 02:45:14.573]  They have a mantra.
[02:45:14.613 --> 02:45:18.974]  You've heard it many times out of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:45:19.575 --> 02:45:20.215]  Here's a quote.
[02:45:21.893 --> 02:45:27.977]  None of these crises can be solved by nations alone.
[02:45:28.037 --> 02:45:29.718]  They require regional solutions.
[02:45:29.758 --> 02:45:31.499]  That's why they'll never let a nation handle it.
[02:45:31.519 --> 02:45:34.400]  They'll let it get out of control and make it be a global solution.
[02:45:34.741 --> 02:45:36.001]  Great point, good to hear from you.
[02:45:36.642 --> 02:45:38.143]  Okay, let's go to Chris in Kentucky.
[02:45:38.163 --> 02:45:39.723]  Thanks for holding your on the air worldwide.
[02:45:40.604 --> 02:45:42.565]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:45:42.645 --> 02:45:44.826]  Hey Chris, you've been calling in the show for like 15, 16 years.
[02:45:46.274 --> 02:45:47.114]  Yeah, it's been a while.
[02:45:47.254 --> 02:45:50.535]  I know, being a slave to the New World Order with the Federal Reserve and all that.
[02:45:50.555 --> 02:45:52.996]  Haven't you been, wait a minute, I remember you used to call it out a nighttime show.
[02:45:53.236 --> 02:45:54.936]  Have you been calling in since like 98?
[02:45:55.916 --> 02:45:58.317]  I called in the first about 1998, yeah.
[02:45:58.797 --> 02:45:59.117]  That was in 1998.
[02:45:59.637 --> 02:46:03.578]  Well go ahead, good to hear from you, and you're a TV station operator, right?
[02:46:04.118 --> 02:46:07.539]  Well, no, I used to work in, I did a, we did a paid talk radio show.
[02:46:08.300 --> 02:46:22.332]  And these guys from... I went on AXS television after 9-11 happened and I told the people and taped it and they got it on the air that after 2002 I think it was that the 9-11... I just remember vaguely from my memory something about you working at a TV station or something.
[02:46:22.412 --> 02:46:23.813]  Yeah, it was just a radio station.
[02:46:23.853 --> 02:46:26.975]  We did paid programs and then when 9-11 hit I got more active than ever.
[02:46:27.936 --> 02:46:29.357]  So... Hey, what you calling about, bro?
[02:46:29.998 --> 02:46:31.139]  Oh yeah, Mitch McConnell.
[02:46:31.259 --> 02:46:33.200]  Don't you just like the way they just carried on?
[02:46:33.220 --> 02:46:36.223]  The reality that he just was just...
[02:46:36.842 --> 02:46:38.806]  On and on after he got elected.
[02:46:38.866 --> 02:46:41.472]  Just going like the establishment are just loving this, you know?
[02:46:41.492 --> 02:46:45.220]  I mean, all the things about what the fellas were saying last hour.
[02:46:45.260 --> 02:46:47.024]  We're going to have land grabs.
[02:46:47.583 --> 02:46:48.884]  They're not going to solve the deficit.
[02:46:48.924 --> 02:46:51.224]  They're not going to solve our right to own guns.
[02:46:51.264 --> 02:46:53.345]  They're going to go after this.
[02:46:53.385 --> 02:46:54.106]  By the way, the U.N.
[02:46:54.146 --> 02:46:55.066]  is going after our guns.
[02:46:55.146 --> 02:46:56.627]  Did you hear the report about that?
[02:46:56.667 --> 02:46:56.987]  Yeah, I know.
[02:46:57.007 --> 02:46:59.248]  They've got the treaty and Obama says he'll follow it.
[02:47:00.928 --> 02:47:04.270]  The way they write it, the civilian ownership of firearms will be abolished.
[02:47:04.690 --> 02:47:06.370]  And they say it goes into effect the 24th of December.
[02:47:09.872 --> 02:47:13.174]  Yeah, and that's none of what these people think they do.
[02:47:13.194 --> 02:47:14.856]  Oh, we've got a Republican victory now.
[02:47:14.956 --> 02:47:18.579]  They keep electing these goons in here all the time and nothing gets solved.
[02:47:18.639 --> 02:47:19.499]  Everything's getting worse.
[02:47:19.599 --> 02:47:26.805]  Look at how the Republican leadership is trying to give Obama fast track, which is just unlimited power over trade.
[02:47:26.865 --> 02:47:29.987]  Well, in trade, you can sign agreements that waive sovereignty.
[02:47:34.275 --> 02:47:36.979]  Boehner and McConnell said they weren't going to repeal Obamacare.
[02:47:37.319 --> 02:47:39.602]  Then after a bunch of heat, they said, OK, we'll try.
[02:47:40.383 --> 02:47:43.867]  Well, no, you better get the job done or we'll get somebody else in there.
[02:47:44.208 --> 02:47:45.469]  We need to start recalls.
[02:47:46.798 --> 02:47:47.858]  of McConnell and Boehner.
[02:47:48.379 --> 02:47:53.800]  We need to demand that members of Congress try to have a vote to oust these guys out of the leadership.
[02:47:53.820 --> 02:47:55.701]  I mean, it's just a sick joke.
[02:47:55.901 --> 02:47:59.262]  We do not need more establishment Republicans.
[02:47:59.322 --> 02:48:02.163]  I mean, they're wrecking the country on purpose.
[02:48:02.463 --> 02:48:04.164]  They're trying to give Obama more power.
[02:48:04.464 --> 02:48:06.765]  No, no, no, Chris.
[02:48:06.805 --> 02:48:07.225]  Anything else?
[02:48:08.041 --> 02:48:12.105]  Yeah, I just had a caller Friday about Southeast Christian Church with somebody speaking over there.
[02:48:12.886 --> 02:48:16.569]  Dave Stone's the pastor of that church, is the guy's name.
[02:48:16.589 --> 02:48:18.110]  That's all I heard him on the rebroadcast.
[02:48:21.503 --> 02:48:22.244]  Ask the questions.
[02:48:22.304 --> 02:48:22.684]  I like that.
[02:48:22.784 --> 02:48:24.146]  Protest in a hazmat suit.
[02:48:24.546 --> 02:48:25.367]  That was from Friday's show.
[02:48:25.387 --> 02:48:26.128]  That's right, folks.
[02:48:26.368 --> 02:48:26.808]  Look, look.
[02:48:27.329 --> 02:48:29.591]  All of you are not as good as I am.
[02:48:29.611 --> 02:48:30.011]  You're better.
[02:48:30.672 --> 02:48:33.515]  You've all got skills that are better than Alex Jones.
[02:48:34.135 --> 02:48:38.619]  You've all got skills that are better than a Joseph Farah or better than a Matt Drudge.
[02:48:38.659 --> 02:48:42.223]  Now, we're better than other people in certain ways as well, but we're all better in certain ways.
[02:48:42.723 --> 02:48:43.484]  Use your skills.
[02:48:44.165 --> 02:48:44.945]  Use your passion.
[02:48:45.706 --> 02:48:46.707]  Go confront people.
[02:48:46.847 --> 02:48:47.647]  Ask real questions.
[02:48:47.707 --> 02:48:48.708]  Start an access show.
[02:48:48.748 --> 02:48:49.668]  Start a local radio show.
[02:48:49.928 --> 02:48:50.949]  Start a YouTube channel.
[02:48:51.289 --> 02:48:52.230]  Run for Congress.
[02:48:52.790 --> 02:48:53.610]  Educate your neighbors.
[02:48:54.011 --> 02:48:56.992]  We will win this war by a billion cuts against the enemy.
[02:48:57.272 --> 02:48:58.313]  That's how they're attacking us?
[02:48:58.653 --> 02:49:01.114]  We just start woodpeckering them.
[02:49:01.174 --> 02:49:02.595]  We start undermining them.
[02:49:02.955 --> 02:49:04.696]  We start withdrawing our consent.
[02:49:04.796 --> 02:49:06.657]  Not complying with unconstitutional stuff.
[02:49:06.917 --> 02:49:08.638]  Just sabotaging the enemy everywhere.
[02:49:09.659 --> 02:49:14.722]  I mean, you know, I'm not saying you should come out at four in the morning and climb a billboard that's got government propaganda on it and spray paint it.
[02:49:15.945 --> 02:49:17.326]  That's the funnest stuff there is to do.
[02:49:17.346 --> 02:49:18.647]  I just don't know.
[02:49:19.068 --> 02:49:22.370]  Anyways, what I'm getting at here is we're done playing games, okay?
[02:49:22.711 --> 02:49:23.311]  We're done.
[02:49:23.691 --> 02:49:24.532]  Gloves are off.
[02:49:25.493 --> 02:49:27.154]  We are the people trying to save the country.
[02:49:27.214 --> 02:49:28.295]  We're following the law.
[02:49:28.675 --> 02:49:32.098]  The globalists are laughing, saying they're lying to us and cheating us.
[02:49:32.378 --> 02:49:33.799]  They are out of control.
[02:49:33.839 --> 02:49:34.360]  God bless you.
[02:49:35.601 --> 02:49:38.063]  Azriel, if I pronounced that right, in Nebraska.
[02:49:38.103 --> 02:49:39.204]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:49:39.224 --> 02:49:41.045]  Hey, thanks, Alex.
[02:49:41.085 --> 02:49:43.607]  I have a couple questions for you, if you can shed some light for me.
[02:49:43.747 --> 02:49:44.368]  Sure, go ahead, brother.
[02:49:45.539 --> 02:49:57.490]  Alright, I don't know if you've covered this before, but can you shed some light on Bill HR 6566 and also the alleged 30,000 guillotines the government ordered?
[02:49:58.011 --> 02:50:03.676]  Yes, I've had this call for 20 years on AXS television when I started and then on Talk Radio 19 years ago.
[02:50:05.473 --> 02:50:15.181]  And there is a bill, there was a bill, to have execution not by electric chair or lethal injection or gas chamber, but by guillotine.
[02:50:16.082 --> 02:50:22.527]  And because the Bible in Revelation talks about Christians dying by having their heads chopped off, people think it's that.
[02:50:22.567 --> 02:50:26.451]  But I mean, Saudi Arabia chops heads off, so I don't know if that's particularly that.
[02:50:27.491 --> 02:50:38.317]  And then I've always heard the story, a truck crashed in Houston, a truck crashed in Maine, you know, in Bangor, a truck crashed in Denver, and it had martial law signs and guillotines.
[02:50:39.677 --> 02:50:40.778]  And I've never seen any proof.
[02:50:40.818 --> 02:50:44.060]  It's kind of this perennial, perpetual urban legend.
[02:50:44.780 --> 02:50:52.184]  But then meanwhile, they are training the military and the CIA for torture of the American people and secret arrests.
[02:50:52.644 --> 02:50:56.526]  I mean, Joe Biggs was just a standard staff sergeant in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[02:50:57.595 --> 02:51:01.242]  And one of his main jobs was delivering detainees for torture.
[02:51:02.024 --> 02:51:03.847]  And he said a lot of times they wouldn't even come out.
[02:51:04.849 --> 02:51:06.893]  He says he believes they were tortured to death.
[02:51:08.227 --> 02:51:09.869]  Um, and I mean, that's just standard.
[02:51:10.670 --> 02:51:15.915]  It was declassified that special forces in Vietnam would torture people's kids in front of them with electrodes.
[02:51:16.856 --> 02:51:18.057]  And, you know, hooking them to their genitals.
[02:51:18.838 --> 02:51:20.319]  They call it dialing fish up.
[02:51:20.699 --> 02:51:24.563]  You can take an old, you know, cranked telephone, put two wires in the water and crank it.
[02:51:25.164 --> 02:51:26.265]  It's a good way to get your bait.
[02:51:26.945 --> 02:51:28.067]  Not that I've ever done it or anything.
[02:51:31.329 --> 02:51:38.853]  And these were Green Berets who believed they were fighting communism, so it was worth it to do it, because the Viet Cong were doing stuff like that.
[02:51:38.933 --> 02:51:41.374]  See, you become evil to beat the evil.
[02:51:41.514 --> 02:51:42.755]  No, you don't beat them, you become it.
[02:51:43.696 --> 02:51:45.236]  George Washington did not torture.
[02:51:45.697 --> 02:51:47.477]  He did not rape, like the British did.
[02:51:48.278 --> 02:51:52.280]  And if he... In fact, if you read the real history, he was hanging people every week.
[02:51:53.420 --> 02:51:55.742]  I mean, you did something, George Washington would hang you.
[02:51:56.962 --> 02:51:58.463]  It was because he had the moral high ground.
[02:51:59.813 --> 02:52:09.016]  Now, he did sign death warrants to, you know, kill British officers in their homes and stuff like that, but track them down and kill them by any means necessary with assassins, but if you abuse civilians, he would kill you.

[02:52:36.747 --> 02:52:41.752]  Are you ready to surrender your right to buy body armor?
[02:52:42.012 --> 02:52:42.653]  No joke.
[02:52:42.793 --> 02:52:45.415]  Congress is now trying to outlaw civilian body armor.
[02:52:45.476 --> 02:52:46.577]  And if House Bill H.R.
[02:52:47.277 --> 02:52:52.423]  If 5344 becomes law, you can kiss your right to protect yourself against rifle bullets goodbye.
[02:52:52.563 --> 02:52:55.206]  Don't put off your body armor purchase any longer.

[02:53:05.877 --> 02:53:07.258]  Infidel Body Armor.
[02:53:07.318 --> 02:53:08.460]  Just won't quit.
[02:53:08.920 --> 02:53:15.162]  When I first got online and I seen the price of X2 and the DNA Force, I was a little hesitant, but I pulled the trigger on it.
[02:53:15.282 --> 02:53:16.263]  It has changed my life.
[02:53:16.283 --> 02:53:18.363]  I've been taking it for about 24 days now.
[02:53:18.443 --> 02:53:19.804]  Counting the weights, staying in shape.
[02:53:19.964 --> 02:53:22.385]  InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:53:22.505 --> 02:53:23.925]  You've heard the callers to the show.
[02:53:23.965 --> 02:53:27.846]  Several months back, I started taking your nascent iodine and your super meal.
[02:53:27.926 --> 02:53:29.787]  Prior to this, I was barely walking.
[02:53:29.907 --> 02:53:32.548]  Now I'm able to function as a human again.
[02:53:32.688 --> 02:53:42.099]  Whether it's survival shield nascent iodine or DNA force, super male vitality, super female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shields, oxy powder.

[02:55:05.878 --> 02:55:06.678]  GCN.
[02:55:14.170 --> 02:55:25.920]  People want to freak out about that.
[02:55:26.040 --> 02:55:28.943]  China has mobile execution vans in every city.
[02:55:29.623 --> 02:55:38.371]  They hold prisoners by their blood type and genetic type, and when a Westerner wants it, they fly to Japan generally, not China, and then they gut you
[02:55:39.739 --> 02:55:46.465]  And bag all your organs and everything to be sold off as they drive you to the airport.
[02:55:46.685 --> 02:55:53.051]  And there's the headline, China's high-tech death van where criminals are executed, their organs are sold in the black market.
[02:55:54.392 --> 02:55:58.335]  And that's the type of stuff that's going on where humans are turned into a total commodity.
[02:55:58.756 --> 02:55:59.997]  Why not just say they're not humans?
[02:56:00.057 --> 02:56:01.018]  Just say they're fetuses.
[02:56:02.299 --> 02:56:03.500]  Criticizing the communists?
[02:56:03.540 --> 02:56:07.063]  Well, you're gonna get your organs sold to some trendies flying into Tokyo.
[02:56:08.134 --> 02:56:10.776]  Pentagon not sure it wounded, mythical bad guy.
[02:56:10.796 --> 02:56:14.699]  They claim they killed the leader of ISIS and now they're not sure.
[02:56:14.719 --> 02:56:18.222]  Immunologist admits babies only vaccinated to train parents.
[02:56:18.882 --> 02:56:21.985]  Interstellar, a positive message for humanity at the crossroads of history.
[02:56:22.445 --> 02:56:24.106]  The world isn't listening to the U.S.
[02:56:24.246 --> 02:56:25.948]  unless it's killing people, Curt Nemo.
[02:56:26.608 --> 02:56:34.574]  Obamacare architect, lack of transparency, lying was key to fooling stupid Americans, close quote.
[02:56:34.594 --> 02:56:37.777]  Now Obama says now we need his troops on the ground.
[02:56:39.019 --> 02:56:43.980]  Remember he promised a few months ago no trips on the ground when he was sending them so that you knew that it meant trips on the ground.
[02:56:44.200 --> 02:56:47.961]  So it's about always lying to you to break your will and let you know you will be lied to.
[02:56:48.701 --> 02:56:49.401]  That's what it's all about.
[02:56:49.901 --> 02:56:55.482]  It's all about betrayal, all about fraud, all about being evil, all about exercising evil, all about conditioning you.
[02:56:57.582 --> 02:57:00.243]  So that's just some of the news up on Infowars.com.
[02:57:02.043 --> 02:57:06.624]  Ferguson police say they expect riots whether grand jury indicts or not, preparing for all
[02:57:07.816 --> 02:57:08.257]  I don't know.
[02:57:08.297 --> 02:57:09.518]  I'll have time to go to George.
[02:57:09.538 --> 02:57:12.441]  I'm gonna go to Derek here in just a moment.
[02:57:26.645 --> 02:57:29.086]  Also, remember, we are about to sell out of X2.
[02:57:29.106 --> 02:57:33.247]  It'll be a few weeks till we get more of the proprietary SuperNation Iodine.
[02:57:33.527 --> 02:57:38.029]  We have some of the original left that just isn't as strong, and it's from a very good seaweed base.
[02:57:38.049 --> 02:57:40.830]  The other is from a deep-earth crystal source no one else has.
[02:57:40.850 --> 02:57:45.751]  We're almost selling out of DNA Force, which has amazing things for immunity, obviously, and overall health.
[02:57:46.191 --> 02:57:47.772]  OxyPowder is about to sell out.
[02:57:48.732 --> 02:57:50.553]  Survival Shield X2, as I mentioned.
[02:57:50.573 --> 02:57:51.773]  We got some Fluoride Shield.
[02:57:52.193 --> 02:57:53.333]  SuperMetal is about to sell out.
[02:57:53.754 --> 02:57:54.194]  We do have
[02:57:55.094 --> 02:58:01.697]  The Coil Silver is about to come back in, and we do have a new product about to come in, but that's good, because everything else is going to be basically sold out.
[02:58:01.717 --> 02:58:08.100]  So if you want to get the products, InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:58:08.140 --> 02:58:12.362]  All the books, the videos, the Pro Liberty products, InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:58:19.705 --> 02:58:21.626]  Derek in Wyoming, you're on the air.
[02:58:21.666 --> 02:58:21.986]  Welcome.
[02:58:23.530 --> 02:58:24.750]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:58:24.991 --> 02:58:28.292]  Say, it's good to be on your show, and thanks for what you do.
[02:58:28.312 --> 02:58:29.952]  I know you don't like being thanked, but thanks.
[02:58:30.072 --> 02:58:31.833]  Thank you that your voice is so loud.
[02:58:32.513 --> 02:58:36.455]  You know, as a 22-year-old, I was freaking out that Bush Sr.
[02:58:36.475 --> 02:58:40.696]  went and signed that in Rio, but funny thing happened to me in 2011 and March got saved.
[02:58:41.237 --> 02:58:45.658]  But you know, I'm not going to sit and wait in the church house, wait to be teleported out.
[02:58:46.118 --> 02:58:49.620]  I believe we've got to have the victory in the prayer closet and come out firing all day.
[02:58:50.200 --> 02:58:52.621]  And these vaccines are just horrendous.
[02:58:53.602 --> 02:58:54.502]  Um, I'm with ya.
[02:58:55.043 --> 02:58:57.203]  I see so many kids messed up like this.
[02:58:57.223 --> 02:58:58.084]  Daycares everywhere.
[02:58:58.124 --> 02:58:59.404]  Kids freaking out at that.
[02:59:00.244 --> 02:59:04.346]  I'm not sure what to do, but all I do, I do know that it's the only thing to do with evil is hit it in the mouth.
[02:59:05.046 --> 02:59:06.326]  And you know, we gotta get active.
[02:59:06.367 --> 02:59:08.167]  And I went and saw our county health nurse.
[02:59:08.287 --> 02:59:09.648]  Asked them point blank questions.
[02:59:09.688 --> 02:59:10.568]  Showed them the studies.
[02:59:11.168 --> 02:59:13.389]  And they looked at me like I was nuts.
[02:59:13.929 --> 02:59:15.250]  But they looked at the studies.
[02:59:15.690 --> 02:59:18.971]  Now when they go inject that, uh, wicked
[02:59:22.584 --> 02:59:31.050]  And visit them again and again and again and then say, now I know you know.
[02:59:31.570 --> 02:59:33.431]  Now it's on you, the brain-damaged kids.
[02:59:33.491 --> 02:59:34.732]  Convict their soul.
[02:59:35.153 --> 02:59:38.075]  Get them to think about what's happening, because most of them are compartmentalized.
[02:59:38.415 --> 02:59:39.135]  Amazing, brother.
[02:59:39.175 --> 02:59:39.696]  We love you.
[02:59:39.956 --> 02:59:41.077]  Thank you, Derrick in Wyoming.
[02:59:41.157 --> 02:59:43.679]  That's the kind of guy that's going to help turn things around.
[02:59:43.739 --> 02:59:44.319]  We salute you.
[02:59:44.539 --> 02:59:47.121]  We're going to break and overdrive, InfoWars.com.
[02:59:47.421 --> 02:59:49.663]  See you back tonight, 7 o'clock Central, and tomorrow.
[02:59:49.983 --> 02:59:51.829]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:59:53.515 --> 02:59:55.763]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:59:59.614 --> 03:00:00.834]  Another major health threat.
[03:00:00.854 --> 03:00:05.756]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[03:00:05.836 --> 03:00:08.477]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[03:00:08.517 --> 03:00:15.299]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[03:00:15.559 --> 03:00:18.420]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[03:00:18.560 --> 03:00:21.481]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[03:00:21.501 --> 03:00:23.481]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[03:00:23.521 --> 03:00:26.342]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[03:00:26.442 --> 03:00:31.944]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.

[03:00:56.215 --> 03:00:57.757]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:01:21.861 --> 03:01:22.781]  Fix bayonets.
[03:01:23.382 --> 03:01:30.404]  We are now entering overdrive with your host, Alex Jones, broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:01:30.965 --> 03:01:34.606]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:01:36.693 --> 03:01:38.334]  Well, you have a right to private property.
[03:01:38.354 --> 03:01:41.615]  A couple of fiends were refusing to host a same-sex wedding on their farm.
[03:01:41.635 --> 03:01:46.097]  They said they're not against anybody, but, you know, they're Christians and they got kids there.
[03:01:46.117 --> 03:01:49.078]  And they just don't want to have that scene going on.
[03:01:49.478 --> 03:01:52.019]  Whether you agree with that or disagree with it, don't you agree with private property rights?
[03:01:52.559 --> 03:01:55.380]  Meanwhile, W likes the idea of Bush versus Clinton.
[03:01:55.801 --> 03:01:57.501]  Well, the polls show the people don't like it.
[03:01:57.801 --> 03:02:04.344]  And W, you're very unpopular, so please, please, go enjoy your Patriot Act and everything else you did.
[03:02:06.077 --> 03:02:09.038]  You're amnesty, you push, another sickening person, I just tell you.
[03:02:09.759 --> 03:02:10.679]  I'm about to throw up.
[03:02:10.939 --> 03:02:12.220]  Phil in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:02:13.840 --> 03:02:14.981]  How's it going, Alex?
[03:02:15.021 --> 03:02:15.821]  Good talking with you.
[03:02:15.841 --> 03:02:27.986]  Hey, you know, I don't know how old your kids are, but when they get old enough and you start to have grandkids, you're gonna be bouncing off the wall.
[03:02:30.867 --> 03:02:32.628]  Well, I'm bouncing off the wall with my kids.
[03:02:32.688 --> 03:02:33.488]  I love my kids.
[03:02:34.511 --> 03:02:35.391]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:02:35.471 --> 03:02:42.334]  But with these inoculations, with these vaccines, my daughter just had the first grandchild.
[03:02:42.814 --> 03:02:46.015]  My grandson, he's about nine months.
[03:02:46.035 --> 03:02:49.677]  He's getting ready for the Quad4 vaccine.
[03:02:50.157 --> 03:02:52.378]  That's the MMR and V vaccine.
[03:02:52.398 --> 03:02:53.818]  Well, you know there's no law.
[03:02:53.878 --> 03:02:54.919]  You don't have to take it, right?
[03:02:55.919 --> 03:02:56.699]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:02:56.739 --> 03:02:57.660]  And I tell my daughter,
[03:02:59.164 --> 03:03:02.367]  Really watch out, she's a nurse even, and I tell her, and she knows.
[03:03:03.568 --> 03:03:07.131]  But there's no, even if you believe in vaccines, they don't work in the first year.
[03:03:07.151 --> 03:03:10.273]  Then they cause an autoimmune response in brain damaged kids.
[03:03:10.774 --> 03:03:14.917]  And if you got a boy, it's like 30% chance you're gonna brain damage him.
[03:03:14.977 --> 03:03:16.218]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[03:03:16.879 --> 03:03:18.640]  That's why I'm bouncing off the wall.
[03:03:19.341 --> 03:03:21.242]  And I'm gonna put them on notice, man.
[03:03:21.643 --> 03:03:27.948]  Anything happens... Anything happens, you're gonna be angry.
[03:03:30.117 --> 03:03:30.737]  I'll be angry.
[03:03:31.037 --> 03:03:31.417]  I hear you.
[03:03:31.457 --> 03:03:32.277]  God bless you, brother.
[03:03:32.778 --> 03:03:33.958]  Jenna in California.
[03:03:33.998 --> 03:03:35.018]  You're on the air worldwide.
[03:03:36.578 --> 03:03:37.139]  Hi, Alex.
[03:03:37.639 --> 03:03:38.799]  I've been listening to you for years.
[03:03:38.839 --> 03:03:39.479]  You're amazing.
[03:03:39.579 --> 03:03:50.362]  I know you don't want to claim to be a hero, and none of us do, but you know, when you talk to people and you give good information, you are a hero at the very least.
[03:03:50.822 --> 03:03:52.802]  And most importantly, you're a hero to the unborn.
[03:03:53.222 --> 03:03:53.742]  Okay?
[03:03:53.862 --> 03:03:54.602]  I do what you do.
[03:03:54.683 --> 03:03:56.803]  I go up to women that are pregnant.
[03:03:57.663 --> 03:04:02.426]  Uh, women with small babies, and I tell them as much as they'll listen to.
[03:04:02.606 --> 03:04:03.127]  And you know what?
[03:04:03.507 --> 03:04:05.208]  Usually, they are receptive.
[03:04:05.428 --> 03:04:09.391]  Usually, they do want to hear it, because that is their precious baby.
[03:04:09.631 --> 03:04:11.813]  Well, humans used to always get their news from each other.
[03:04:11.833 --> 03:04:13.514]  We're supposed to tell each other what's going on.
[03:04:13.794 --> 03:04:18.017]  We're supposed to say, hey, that restaurant has bad service, or hey, look out, there's a checkpoint down there.
[03:04:18.337 --> 03:04:21.119]  We need to get back to communicating with each other where it's not weird.
[03:04:22.264 --> 03:04:22.504]  Yes.
[03:04:23.125 --> 03:04:25.446]  I don't care if anyone thinks I'm weird, even though I'm not weird.
[03:04:25.486 --> 03:04:26.527]  I'm very educated.
[03:04:26.807 --> 03:04:37.635]  My mother, who was born in 1927, my father in 1920, who was born, you know, like later in life, were my parents, but they both had plenty of children.
[03:04:38.296 --> 03:04:44.320]  And if you do the math with my family, there are hundreds of children combined and grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
[03:04:44.955 --> 03:04:45.355]  Not one?
[03:05:00.313 --> 03:05:02.214]  Like me, she wasn't afraid to give anyone a donation.
[03:05:02.254 --> 03:05:03.214]  Here's for your mom.
[03:05:03.734 --> 03:05:04.555]  Here's for your mom.
[03:05:04.595 --> 03:05:05.215]  God bless you.
[03:05:05.495 --> 03:05:08.416]  Oh, it's a well-known thing to go, hey, your kids are really good looking and smart.
[03:05:09.556 --> 03:05:11.497]  Wow, you know, this is wonderful.
[03:05:12.637 --> 03:05:13.838]  You know, fantastic.
[03:05:14.698 --> 03:05:16.219]  You know, you're not vaccinating.
[03:05:16.699 --> 03:05:17.999]  By the way, it is official.
[03:05:18.019 --> 03:05:19.440]  Limbaugh was saying he may do it.
[03:05:20.260 --> 03:05:26.688]  He is now going to basically sue the Democrats for claiming that he wants to attack women and stuff, which was made up.
[03:05:27.229 --> 03:05:29.471]  And he's going to try to go after his sponsors, so good.
[03:05:29.491 --> 03:05:30.473]  I'm glad Limbaugh's doing that.
[03:05:30.733 --> 03:05:33.236]  We've only got like 20 seconds, but he wants to talk about drudge.
[03:05:33.636 --> 03:05:35.579]  Douglas in Ohio, go ahead, last caller.
[03:05:37.156 --> 03:05:41.899]  Yeah Alex, you keep telling me about Drudge and the opt-out program and the $5,000 fine.
[03:05:42.260 --> 03:05:47.984]  I read the article on that a while back and basically Drudge didn't even have to pay a fine.
[03:05:48.404 --> 03:05:56.730]  And if you look at the Obamacare, there's like four religious health care providers that you can join that exempt you from the fine.
[03:05:56.750 --> 03:06:03.955]  Here's the deal, my parents just got told their insurance with Blue Cross Blue Shield that they've had forever is too low, so they are going to be fined.
[03:06:04.035 --> 03:06:04.676]  I have the letter.
[03:06:05.717 --> 03:06:19.172]  And so I don't know what you're reading, but I'm out of time You pick up the receiver with your heart racing and sweat dripping from your forehead you finally muster the courage the ultimate non-gmo organic super
