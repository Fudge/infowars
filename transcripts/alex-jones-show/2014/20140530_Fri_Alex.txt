[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:01.372]  Direct from Austin.
[00:00:02.094 --> 00:00:05.301]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.004]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:16.684 --> 00:00:17.485]  You want answers?
[00:00:18.265 --> 00:00:19.146]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:19.807 --> 00:00:23.450]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.054]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:45.743 --> 00:00:52.485]  Oh man, I feel not even so much exhausted as I feel completely overwhelmed right now.
[00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:59.087]  We have got so many big developments from Bilderberg.
[00:00:59.107 --> 00:01:05.549]  2014 with global leaders going outside the compound, being confronted by journalists, journalists being roughed up, new video.
[00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:10.402]  We've got mainstream media being forced to cover it for the first time.
[00:01:10.462 --> 00:01:19.225]  Even the London Independent saying, hey, it does violate a lot of laws to have world leaders meeting in secret with politicians, elected officials setting policy.
[00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:23.666]  Public servants meeting in secret setting policy.
[00:01:25.087 --> 00:01:32.689]  And I even, I guess we got a video from CNBC where some of the guests and people are going, well, the public's got a point.
[00:01:35.347 --> 00:01:39.209]  I mean there are a bunch of powerful elites meeting in secret and we have a right to know what they're talking about.
[00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:43.370]  This is an official governmental meeting.
[00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:59.917]  The Bilderberg Group bragged a few weeks ago, one of their major members, to the German press that they created the Euro and they set up most of the world's architecture currently and that they are controlling the planet to a great extent.
[00:02:01.297 --> 00:02:02.478]  And so they admit
[00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:06.232]  That they are setting policy.
[00:02:06.672 --> 00:02:21.691]  Yes, if 145 or so royalty, banking heads, heads of industry and government are all friends and they want to say, hey, next year, let's all put in our calendars, we're going to go to British Virgin Islands for two weeks and play golf.
[00:02:22.808 --> 00:02:25.450]  Undoubtedly, business is going to be conducted at night and stuff.
[00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.471]  There'll be some breakaway meetings.
[00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:37.558]  But it's not helicopters and fences and secret police and Ed Balls, the Deputy Prime Minister of England, who I confronted last year inside BBC Studios.
[00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:41.140]  I was on television right after him, so I was able to talk to him in the studio.
[00:02:41.741 --> 00:02:46.864]  We have that video where I bring up Bilderberg with the fact that they're setting policy and I name the British law he's violating.
[00:02:48.105 --> 00:02:52.448]  Watson also confronts him in the hall as he leaves and mentions the law that he's violating.
[00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:55.510]  They really are violating these laws.
[00:02:57.571 --> 00:03:08.739]  And just because the federal laws here and the federal laws in England and others are being ignored, doesn't mean that they're not still laws.
[00:03:11.344 --> 00:03:18.747]  And I personally am getting tired of it because these are the guys pushing gun control worldwide.
[00:03:19.407 --> 00:03:22.909]  These are the people pushing forced inoculation worldwide and population reduction.
[00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:27.170]  These are the people that are pushing everybody around.
[00:03:31.092 --> 00:03:36.194]  And these are the people trying to put in the smart grid that taxes and tracks and controls us.
[00:03:36.654 --> 00:03:38.895]  They're moving us into total authoritarianism.
[00:03:41.582 --> 00:03:43.103]  And that's why I've got a big beef with him.
[00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:52.889]  And then I'm always on the air with other shows, TV shows, and they ask the question, well, Alex, you know, how do we know they're setting up world government?
[00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:54.030]  Well, they've bragged about it.
[00:03:56.491 --> 00:03:57.512]  But I thought it's secret.
[00:03:57.532 --> 00:03:58.232]  Why are they bragging?
[00:03:58.552 --> 00:04:02.655]  Well, criminals love to brag, and stuff they did 30 years ago, 40 years ago, 60 years ago,
[00:04:05.222 --> 00:04:06.543]  They will toot their horn about now.
[00:04:07.283 --> 00:04:11.666]  But they didn't do it till we exposed it and made their lying obsolete.
[00:04:11.966 --> 00:04:13.928]  So now they're just trying to act all confident about it.
[00:04:13.948 --> 00:04:16.309]  Well, of course we're building a private corporate world government.
[00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:17.250]  I mean, who wouldn't?
[00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.231]  I mean, we know how to run stuff better than you.
[00:04:19.251 --> 00:04:22.513]  And plus we're not racist and, uh, you know, political correctness.
[00:04:23.814 --> 00:04:28.517]  You go debate transgender issues while we put cancer viruses in your vaccines or, uh, yeah.
[00:04:29.468 --> 00:04:35.291]  We put so many chemicals in the water that the fish and frogs, the aquatic life is going sterile.
[00:04:39.232 --> 00:04:40.673]  Don't be sexist and bring that up.
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.961]  I mean, these people are out of control.
[00:04:44.762 --> 00:04:54.568]  And, I mean, one thing that they're running our lives and building space bases, and, you know, we already launched our seventh, you know, colony mission to Alpha Centauri, and that they were trying to get people to have brain boosts and stuff.
[00:04:54.608 --> 00:04:56.470]  I'd be like, whoa, these people are really the elite.
[00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:57.851]  We should probably listen to them.
[00:04:58.151 --> 00:05:01.853]  These people are a bunch of scum, narcissists, who hate humanity.
[00:05:02.614 --> 00:05:04.055]  And they are a major problem.
[00:05:07.074 --> 00:05:11.075]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:05:11.115 --> 00:05:15.256]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:05:15.356 --> 00:05:18.877]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:05:19.137 --> 00:05:22.018]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:05:22.178 --> 00:05:29.540]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.381]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:05:33.661 --> 00:05:37.903]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:05:38.063 --> 00:05:44.007]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:05:44.047 --> 00:05:47.829]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:50.530]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.071]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:05:52.231 --> 00:05:53.452]  It's time to take action.
[00:05:53.592 --> 00:05:55.313]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:06:06.974 --> 00:06:17.341]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:19.522]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:06:19.723 --> 00:06:20.403]  Fluoride!
[00:06:20.603 --> 00:06:22.184]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:06:22.524 --> 00:06:28.849]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:06:29.109 --> 00:06:33.912]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:06:34.032 --> 00:06:36.734]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase.
[00:06:37.054 --> 00:06:37.534]  We're good.
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:14.085]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:07:14.185 --> 00:07:16.347]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:07:16.527 --> 00:07:21.630]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.754]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:07:26.974 --> 00:07:30.035]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:07:30.295 --> 00:07:34.156]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:07:34.376 --> 00:07:38.617]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:07:38.677 --> 00:07:48.700]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.441]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:07:51.581 --> 00:07:53.102]  There's a need for a new world order.
[00:07:53.122 --> 00:07:55.743]  But it has different characteristics in different parts of the world.
[00:08:20.396 --> 00:08:26.645]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:47.731 --> 00:08:52.015]  It is the 30th day of May 2014.
[00:08:52.055 --> 00:08:58.660]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to have big updates.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:04.665]  There's been a lot of big developments, but I'm just going to save it until David Knight joins us in about 23 minutes from now.
[00:09:06.198 --> 00:09:09.220]  At 33 after, from Copenhagen, Denmark, the site of Bilderberg 2014.
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:15.726]  Then Paul Joseph Watson, who's in a whole other area covering other developments with Bilderberg.
[00:09:16.586 --> 00:09:17.607]  They're on two different missions.
[00:09:17.667 --> 00:09:27.695]  He's going to be joining us at 12.30 central, or about an hour and twenty-something minutes from now, depending on what time zone you're listening to us or we broadcast.
[00:09:28.556 --> 00:09:29.516]  So that is coming up.
[00:09:29.556 --> 00:09:31.138]  We will have totally open phones.
[00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:33.757]  I pledge to take a lot of calls.
[00:09:33.797 --> 00:09:35.418]  I'm getting pretty good at that when I do open the phones up.
[00:09:35.878 --> 00:09:46.180]  In the third hour, on a Friday, free-for-all, wildcard Friday, whatever issue you want to raise, agree, disagree, yell at me, tell me how great I am.
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.100]  We don't want to hear that.
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.160]  You're allowed to yell at me, no saying how great I am.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.301]  Anyways, it's just not thought-provoking.
[00:09:53.601 --> 00:09:56.641]  Any issue you want to cover, we're going to do it in the third hour today.
[00:09:56.661 --> 00:09:57.502]  I'm being a little bit silly.
[00:09:58.682 --> 00:09:59.202]  Where to start?
[00:10:00.851 --> 00:10:15.956]  Let me cover other big breaking news, because it's a big news day on this Friday, 30th day of May, and walk through some of what's coming up and then get into embattled Veterans Affairs Secretary General Eric Shinseki.
[00:10:17.168 --> 00:10:21.974]  Resigning, and before he went live, I was in the coffee room.
[00:10:21.994 --> 00:10:30.424]  I don't usually do this anymore, because it's so hard to listen to him and look at him, and just to hear the endless deception that comes out of his mouth.
[00:10:31.598 --> 00:10:35.999]  But I did watch pretty much Obama's entire press conference, 20 minutes of it.
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:41.121]  So maybe we'll go through it today or a transcript and cover some of the lies.
[00:10:41.181 --> 00:10:42.441]  But I mean, it was all bull.
[00:10:43.222 --> 00:10:46.102]  So it's really no point at this point.
[00:10:46.122 --> 00:10:52.784]  I mean, should I get up here and prove that 2 plus 2 equals 4, even though they teach it equals whatever he says?
[00:10:54.545 --> 00:10:54.945]  Should I
[00:10:59.605 --> 00:11:03.027]  Go on air and explain to you that raising the debt limit does raise the debt.
[00:11:03.487 --> 00:11:04.187]  He says it doesn't.
[00:11:05.888 --> 00:11:10.410]  Should I get up here and explain that it is in the bill, $5,000 fine for not getting Obamacare?
[00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.891]  Even though they deny it's in there.
[00:11:13.291 --> 00:11:16.313]  Should I show you the bill where it has death panels, even though they say it isn't there?
[00:11:16.333 --> 00:11:23.956]  I mean, at a certain point, it really just becomes repetitive to go over their lies.
[00:11:24.036 --> 00:11:25.357]  But we've got to do it, so we will.
[00:11:30.954 --> 00:11:43.285]  I have done a lot of studying, and as listeners, you've done a lot of studying, I know, what our guests have covered here on the radio broadcast over the years.
[00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:54.274]  Guests like Doug Rocky.
[00:11:56.806 --> 00:12:04.310]  Who was the head of the DU program for the Department of Defense after he was the head of it for the Army.
[00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:20.338]  And who wrote the official manual, what was it, 1987, that is still used by the Army and other armed services for the use, containment, cleanup of depleted uranium munitions.
[00:12:21.358 --> 00:12:24.800]  Now, why am I just starting there?
[00:12:26.857 --> 00:12:51.161]  Because to understand what's happening to the troops, and understand it's premeditated on record, when I even start getting into an area like the veterans and the troops, there is an explosion of data in my memory and my mind of publicly available, prima facie, undisputed, absolute, incontrovertible facts.
[00:12:55.166 --> 00:13:16.835]  in thousands of different secret tests that have been declassified that killed tens of thousands of active duty troops from the 30s right through until now and the vaccines and the medical experiments
[00:13:18.402 --> 00:13:27.468]  They do it all in plain view, so of course there's an attitude at most VAs that the veterans are garbage, are scum, and are on welfare.
[00:13:28.749 --> 00:13:44.700]  And we've had countless whistleblowers the last three weeks, with Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs interviewing them on the nightly news, and on the website, Infowars.com, where senior people at the VA, and senior, and nurses, and doctors, and people going public
[00:13:45.902 --> 00:13:50.104]  Where they call them welfare queens and subhuman and hate them.
[00:13:50.444 --> 00:14:00.389]  And there is a minority of people in the VA, mainly veterans, who try to take care of the veterans, even though it's a tough job, and the money's diverted, and the forms are falsified.
[00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:12.996]  I mean, they'll say, it's come out in the news, I told you this a long time ago, but it's in the news this week, that they'll say they've done a surgery to remove a cancer, and they just won't remove it, and won't even do the surgery and let them die.
[00:14:13.971 --> 00:14:23.673]  And by the way, we're not talking about 85-year-old Korea War vets or 89-year-old World War II vets, which I think it's really evil to not give them treatment.
[00:14:24.373 --> 00:14:26.954]  But there's the argument, well, they're old and they can't be helped.
[00:14:26.994 --> 00:14:27.914]  It's just better they die.
[00:14:28.294 --> 00:14:39.797]  We're talking about 25-year-old Marine Corps and Army vets that we now learn one of the biggest suicide reasons is that they literally can't get shrapnel removed.
[00:14:41.638 --> 00:15:03.448]  I mean, folks, it should have told you everything you needed to know when I learned about it in mainstream news a few years ago, that they are ordering the volunteer army, that's not volunteer, in automatic re-up, and the fact that people don't have the money or the health care they need already, they're ordering people who've had their feet blown off.
[00:15:04.602 --> 00:15:06.423]  And hands blown off.
[00:15:07.183 --> 00:15:15.407]  They are slapping robot hands and legs on them that don't even work and are ordering them back into combat.
[00:15:15.947 --> 00:15:18.188]  Nobody's ever done that.
[00:15:20.029 --> 00:15:24.171]  They are using them up like I put 10 gallons of gas in my truck.
[00:15:26.553 --> 00:15:28.694]  But when I put 10 gallons in it, it's going to be burned up.
[00:15:29.114 --> 00:15:29.934]  It's not alive.
[00:15:30.054 --> 00:15:30.734]  It's inanimate.
[00:15:31.455 --> 00:15:32.475]  It creates carbon dioxide.
[00:15:32.495 --> 00:15:33.195]  Plants breathe.
[00:15:33.935 --> 00:15:35.336]  It puts out some other toxic stuff.
[00:15:35.676 --> 00:15:37.316]  But it's not personal.
[00:15:38.057 --> 00:15:42.518]  It'd be one thing if they were using up the troops and they were some alien species and just didn't care about them.
[00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.631]  Let's say aliens posing as humans were running things, and they were acting like this.
[00:15:47.311 --> 00:15:53.853]  They would, you know, they've got 7,000 IQs, we're dumb animals to them, and, you know, I eat cows.
[00:15:55.073 --> 00:15:57.574]  It wouldn't be personal, I'd still want to defeat the alien species.
[00:15:58.914 --> 00:16:03.375]  These are our own humans, and they like treating the troops bad.
[00:16:04.335 --> 00:16:04.736]  On record.
[00:16:04.916 --> 00:16:05.956]  They enjoy it.
[00:16:06.738 --> 00:16:07.939]  These people are scum.
[00:16:07.959 --> 00:16:08.980]  Because here's the deal.
[00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:23.975]  If you're doing bad things to innocent people and you don't want to take care of the old or the young or the the infirm and you don't have a natural nurturing thing in you to want to help people, you can just write people off and let them die.
[00:16:26.537 --> 00:16:28.079]  When you're doing things like that,
[00:16:29.611 --> 00:16:34.815]  It's going to hurt you and you're going to feel bad if you've got any soul, any humanity.
[00:16:35.236 --> 00:16:38.719]  But for the people that will do this, they like it, folks.
[00:16:38.799 --> 00:16:40.861]  That's why they excel in this system.
[00:16:41.681 --> 00:16:53.972]  They knew in 1946, and we've read the paper on air with Dr. Rockey, the exact name of the Pentagon Department of Defense memo,
[00:16:56.476 --> 00:16:59.717]  But I think it's radioactive particles and gases as a weapon.
[00:17:03.058 --> 00:17:19.202]  And in the big multi-hundred page paper that was declassified in the 80s, they say we can create DU weapons with our reactor waste and nuclear weapons production waste, atomic weapons production waste at the time, and it'll shoot through basically anything.
[00:17:19.242 --> 00:17:20.342]  The kinetic power is unbelievable.
[00:17:20.802 --> 00:17:22.723]  The problem is it creates
[00:17:26.004 --> 00:17:34.968]  Particles of it that are a death sentence when any mammal comes in contact with them and will massively reduce lifespan and will cause all sorts of degenerative effects.
[00:17:35.268 --> 00:17:40.191]  So, from the 40s until 1990, no one in the world would use DU.
[00:17:42.688 --> 00:17:53.292]  The US military had three places they would let the A-10 Warthog tank killers and pilots test on, and those were areas you didn't send humans into.
[00:17:53.872 --> 00:17:57.194]  Areas they decided to shoot old tanks up with, and...
[00:17:58.334 --> 00:18:00.955]  They had bunker busters tipped with it that were for wartime use.
[00:18:01.575 --> 00:18:04.496]  And they had caches of it deployed all over Eastern Europe.
[00:18:04.796 --> 00:18:15.959]  If the Russians, with 10 to 1 tank superiority, poured in across in a Soviet invasion of Western Europe, they would then, in what would already become a nuclear war, hand out the DU weapons.
[00:18:16.399 --> 00:18:17.600]  And the Russians have them as well.
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.080]  It's a doomsday weapon.
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.741]  You're going to go ahead and have a nuclear war, you use it.
[00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:25.869]  Okay?
[00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:27.910]  It's an emergency weapon.
[00:18:28.391 --> 00:18:30.091]  What changed from 1946 to 1990?
[00:18:31.832 --> 00:18:32.313]  What changed in 87?
[00:18:33.133 --> 00:18:50.562]  Rocky's report said, of course we can't use it, because they were looking at using it more, and it's totally deadly, and, you know, he even kind of worked with them and said, well, if you wear decontamination suits and then it's drug off and buried in big pits and everyone's washed off immediately and you, you know, you wear breathers, you know, the risk might not be that, you know, too bad it doesn't go through your skin.
[00:18:52.263 --> 00:18:52.743]  You understand?
[00:18:52.823 --> 00:18:53.764]  But we shouldn't use it.
[00:18:54.653 --> 00:18:56.094]  And they went, you know what, we're gonna use it.
[00:18:59.595 --> 00:19:00.875]  And the Israelis started using it.
[00:19:01.235 --> 00:19:04.136]  They used it in Gaza, and it all blows right back on Israel.
[00:19:04.376 --> 00:19:07.758]  I mean, let's say the Israelis don't think the Gazan Palestinians are humans.
[00:19:10.178 --> 00:19:11.759]  Are you human when it blows back on you?
[00:19:11.799 --> 00:19:16.681]  See, this is the classic thing of where you treat someone like they're not a human, it blows back on you.
[00:19:18.061 --> 00:19:23.003]  It's the archetype of the Germans in World War I were the first to use nerve gas,
[00:19:23.936 --> 00:19:26.718]  Primitive nerve gas, chlorine gas, mustard gas.
[00:19:27.238 --> 00:19:30.780]  They would shoot it across, and then the wind would just turn and blow it right back on them.
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:31.901]  Half the time.
[00:19:36.143 --> 00:19:37.904]  I mean, this is madness, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:38.324 --> 00:19:40.586]  So you want to talk about, did they know?
[00:19:40.726 --> 00:19:44.948]  Oh, and then I saw Shepard Spitzerstein blowing up at his guests, going, how dare you say Obama's involved?
[00:19:45.128 --> 00:19:46.229]  That's Republican politics.
[00:19:46.589 --> 00:19:47.890]  They're trying to score points on this.
[00:19:49.156 --> 00:19:50.457]  Of course it's political.
[00:19:50.697 --> 00:19:51.798]  That doesn't matter.
[00:19:52.098 --> 00:19:55.820]  It's gotten worse under Obama because it's on purpose and they hate the veterans.
[00:19:56.301 --> 00:20:02.885]  Everybody I talk to, including Democrats, says the VA's much worse the last six years because they hate the troops more than ever.
[00:20:03.145 --> 00:20:05.807]  And that culture of hating troops has now totally taken over.
[00:20:07.065 --> 00:20:08.245]  You know about RVs.
[00:20:08.445 --> 00:20:09.706]  You've heard about bunkers.
[00:20:09.926 --> 00:20:12.467]  But surviving is not recreation.
[00:20:12.667 --> 00:20:15.188]  And man wasn't made to live underground.

[00:22:05.856 --> 00:22:08.418]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:22:08.678 --> 00:22:13.541]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:22:13.802 --> 00:22:21.687]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:22:21.927 --> 00:22:26.230]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:30.253]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:22:30.413 --> 00:22:36.115]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:39.136]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:22:39.516 --> 00:22:44.737]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:22:44.897 --> 00:22:53.000]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:12.020]  Then get the mud!
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.440]  My Magic Mud.
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:18.401]  The fluoride-free whitener with no chemicals, additives, GMOs, or bad taste.

[00:24:01.527 --> 00:24:04.148]  The Door Sentinel, your home's first line of defense.
[00:24:24.846 --> 00:24:36.630]  I want to quantify something here.
[00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:42.951]  And I'm going to say a lot of really obvious things, but things that I don't think people really focus on.
[00:24:44.152 --> 00:24:48.493]  So often, I hear people saying, man, you're such a pessimist.
[00:24:49.454 --> 00:24:52.136]  You think there's these evil people that run everything and we have no power?
[00:24:52.256 --> 00:24:53.857]  No, that's the opposite of what I'm saying.
[00:24:55.038 --> 00:25:12.650]  There are corrupt special interests and different combines worldwide, and we've identified the main three groups, and substratas and mafias, and they use pretty much the same systems because it's what works the best to control people, and so it's the system that unifies the evil.
[00:25:14.642 --> 00:25:16.443]  Coral reefs all over the world look the same.
[00:25:17.224 --> 00:25:21.647]  They're different species of fish, different species of coral, but they pretty much look the same.
[00:25:21.667 --> 00:25:23.089]  Because that's what works.
[00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:35.398]  And the systems the globalists have developed out of all these cultures and civilizations and empires are pretty similar because it's what works in an authoritarian model.
[00:25:36.439 --> 00:25:37.379]  We go through patterns.
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.661]  We only live 74 years on average.
[00:25:40.202 --> 00:25:41.062]  Men, women, 76.
[00:25:41.242 --> 00:25:44.145]  It's been that way for thousands of years.
[00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:49.892]  We feel like we're individuals, but we really are in a collective.
[00:25:50.493 --> 00:25:59.437]  But, we are individuals who make individual choices that shapes the collective, not globalists trying to create a false collective that they program and shape.
[00:25:59.817 --> 00:26:08.482]  That's what I'm getting at here is, there is a big globalist, Anglo-American, Dutch, German, New World Order, merged with the Rothschilds mafia.
[00:26:10.513 --> 00:26:14.220]  That is the dominant global force because the West was the best.
[00:26:14.501 --> 00:26:19.710]  The West had the best art, literature, renaissance, and statistically some of the best scientists.
[00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:22.309]  The talent.
[00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:23.470]  There's talent everywhere.
[00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:25.251]  I mean, it's like racers.
[00:26:25.331 --> 00:26:36.238]  I mean, you know, if a top runner in a two-mile race is two seconds faster than the other guy, that's not really much, but it doesn't matter.
[00:26:36.278 --> 00:26:37.379]  He's still the world champion.
[00:26:37.939 --> 00:26:40.581]  Well, the globalists are a couple steps ahead of everybody.
[00:26:42.202 --> 00:26:44.684]  Does that mean the Chinese elite aren't absolutely evil?
[00:26:45.044 --> 00:26:46.225]  No, they're really evil.
[00:26:47.285 --> 00:26:48.766]  Does that mean the Russian elite aren't evil?
[00:26:48.826 --> 00:26:49.367]  No, they're evil.
[00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:53.070]  Because they're cheating to control society.
[00:26:54.331 --> 00:26:57.431]  They're using tricks to be in control that are bad.
[00:26:58.412 --> 00:27:02.192]  Because good people don't want to be in power and don't want to dominate people.
[00:27:02.492 --> 00:27:06.533]  We are then automatically supplanted by the evil ones.
[00:27:07.473 --> 00:27:13.475]  Not because they're better than us, but because we won't stand up against them until it's almost too late.
[00:27:13.735 --> 00:27:14.355]  Then we do.
[00:27:14.455 --> 00:27:15.135]  We defeat them.
[00:27:15.635 --> 00:27:16.815]  A new renaissance happens.
[00:27:16.855 --> 00:27:18.316]  We become decadent in the cycle.
[00:27:18.576 --> 00:27:19.896]  They creep back in and take control.
[00:27:20.987 --> 00:27:33.837]  And this time, if we don't reverse them, they're going to probably destroy the planet, irrevocably destroy the genetic code of the human race, and really wreck our chances of becoming a Type 1 civilization and setting up off-world colonies.
[00:27:34.557 --> 00:27:42.083]  And then you can decide if you want to be a transhumanist and leave one colony and do whatever you want here, or you want to go to this colony where people maintain their humanity.
[00:27:42.343 --> 00:27:43.384]  I mean, real freedom.
[00:27:43.724 --> 00:27:44.384]  We need
[00:27:45.445 --> 00:27:49.570]  A renaissance, trailblazing, explorer system.
[00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:50.491]  That's what humans do.
[00:27:50.811 --> 00:27:51.712]  That's what makes us great.
[00:27:51.732 --> 00:27:52.833]  We change our environment.
[00:27:53.093 --> 00:27:56.157]  We do evolve faster than any other species.
[00:27:56.577 --> 00:27:57.498]  We are incredible.
[00:27:57.898 --> 00:28:00.221]  And we need to have a view that we're incredible and amazing.
[00:28:00.581 --> 00:28:03.725]  Not the view put out by the Bilderberg Group that the general public is trash.
[00:28:04.065 --> 00:28:05.266]  While they try to dumb us down.
[00:28:05.506 --> 00:28:12.272]  That sin against life and against true competition is an unbelievable blasphemy.
[00:28:12.552 --> 00:28:14.354]  And if you don't believe in God, that's your issue.
[00:28:14.534 --> 00:28:16.636]  I'm saying it's a blasphemy against art.
[00:28:17.594 --> 00:28:18.935]  It's a blasphemy against beauty.
[00:28:19.696 --> 00:28:21.157]  It's a blasphemy against free will.
[00:28:21.818 --> 00:28:27.863]  It is a tyrannical, authoritarian blasphemy against my soul and my very programming.
[00:28:27.923 --> 00:28:30.065]  And I have a right to self-determine against it.
[00:28:30.385 --> 00:28:32.527]  And if I'm attacked, I have a right at warfare.
[00:28:32.887 --> 00:28:38.051]  And I am in warfare, in information war, with the truth, viciously attacking my enemy.
[00:28:38.432 --> 00:28:41.214]  And I want you to join me in attacking the enemy as well.
[00:28:41.334 --> 00:28:45.798]  Because they're your enemy, one way or another, they're attacking you, whether you admit it or not.
[00:28:47.418 --> 00:28:51.441]  These people are absolutely anathema to everything good.
[00:28:54.243 --> 00:29:00.948]  I like driving by beautiful farmer's fields and seeing the beautiful rows of wheat or corn.
[00:29:01.329 --> 00:29:03.971]  I love seeing happy, beautiful, excited people.
[00:29:04.931 --> 00:29:14.819]  These globalists are the pessimists who don't believe in humanity and who think we're ugly and bad so they're making it a self-fulfilling prophecy and who are waging war against humanity because to a man and a woman, I've studied them,
[00:29:15.933 --> 00:29:19.716]  They like ugliness, and they don't like your good-looking wife.
[00:29:20.037 --> 00:29:21.418]  They don't like you if you're good-looking.
[00:29:21.638 --> 00:29:22.619]  They don't like your art.
[00:29:22.899 --> 00:29:24.220]  They don't like your healthy kids.
[00:29:24.461 --> 00:29:25.942]  They don't like you having your own wealth.
[00:29:26.302 --> 00:29:29.705]  They want it all for themselves.
[00:29:30.806 --> 00:29:32.908]  And they're not gonna stop, and they need to be smashed.
[00:29:34.089 --> 00:29:35.250]  And I mean to smash them.
[00:29:36.671 --> 00:29:41.796]  Because ideas are bulletproof and are spreading quickly right now, and we, more and more, are setting the narrative.
[00:29:43.308 --> 00:29:46.071]  And our narrative isn't perfect, but it points towards the Polestar.
[00:29:46.772 --> 00:29:47.773]  It points towards justice.
[00:29:48.194 --> 00:29:49.075]  We're trying to be good.
[00:29:50.416 --> 00:29:51.718]  And we will defeat the Globalists.
[00:29:51.758 --> 00:29:54.040]  This whole VA thing is on purpose.
[00:29:54.721 --> 00:29:55.142]  Period.
[00:29:56.203 --> 00:29:57.124]  We're on the march.
[00:29:57.605 --> 00:29:59.226]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:00.148 --> 00:30:02.831]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:07.781]  I don't know what it is.
[00:30:08.021 --> 00:30:09.762]  Ralph just won't pay any attention to me.
[00:30:09.882 --> 00:30:13.825]  When he comes home from work, all he ever does is play video games and go to sleep.
[00:30:14.005 --> 00:30:15.246]  It's like I don't even exist.
[00:30:15.606 --> 00:30:17.407]  Oh Betty, that's just awful.
[00:30:17.547 --> 00:30:18.748]  Does this seem familiar?
[00:30:18.928 --> 00:30:21.510]  If the answer to this question is yes, then listen carefully.
[00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:26.854]  Toxic pesticides, GMO foods and additives, BPA plastics, contaminated water supplies,
[00:30:27.054 --> 00:30:31.980]  Many of these toxic additives are deliberately engineered to attack and weaken human masculinity.
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:34.583]  It's part of the eugenics population control movement.
[00:30:34.803 --> 00:30:35.284]  Look it up.
[00:30:35.504 --> 00:30:42.192]  If men are more interested in online gaming than they are in their wives, a serious population crisis is soon to follow.

[00:31:06.966 --> 00:31:14.827]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:31:15.087 --> 00:31:17.168]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:31:17.308 --> 00:31:19.948]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:31:20.008 --> 00:31:24.129]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment, and pushes Obamacare.
[00:31:24.369 --> 00:31:27.590]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:34.871]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:31:35.071 --> 00:31:39.194]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:31:39.375 --> 00:31:41.076]  We are the true media.
[00:31:41.176 --> 00:31:43.758]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:31:43.878 --> 00:31:47.521]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.

[00:32:06.809 --> 00:32:10.811]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:32:10.851 --> 00:32:14.954]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:32:15.214 --> 00:32:18.616]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:32:18.876 --> 00:32:21.758]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:32:21.918 --> 00:32:29.283]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:32:29.483 --> 00:32:33.125]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:32:33.325 --> 00:32:37.647]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:32:37.807 --> 00:32:43.731]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:32:43.771 --> 00:32:47.573]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:32:47.713 --> 00:32:50.254]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:32:50.454 --> 00:32:51.795]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:32:51.955 --> 00:32:53.196]  It's time to take action.
[00:32:53.336 --> 00:32:55.037]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:33:29.195 --> 00:33:34.139]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:39.023 --> 00:33:41.725]  We're about to go to our reporters from Bilderberg 2014.
[00:33:41.845 --> 00:33:49.592]  They have a lot of breaking news, a whole bunch of exclusive videos that really show the illegality that's going on.
[00:33:49.612 --> 00:33:54.095]  We need to get a report out on this, not just the photos and the video, because it's very newsworthy.
[00:33:55.376 --> 00:33:56.517]  That Ed Balls, the
[00:33:58.055 --> 00:34:03.137]  Shadow Chancellor, and in England, it's a complex title, but he's the Deputy Prime Minister, is what it is.
[00:34:03.157 --> 00:34:03.997]  He's like the Vice President.
[00:34:04.777 --> 00:34:12.860]  Basically, the Vice President of England is creeping into the meeting and having to show his credentials to the moron security guard people that don't know who he is.
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:17.902]  Because it's not enough that he has a bee around his neck and has the lanyard, you know, they want to check it.
[00:34:19.002 --> 00:34:21.103]  And so they're sitting there talking to this guy.
[00:34:22.142 --> 00:34:29.748]  And he's got all these official files in his hands, clearly going into set policy, and under multiple laws in England, it's illegal.
[00:34:31.229 --> 00:34:34.292]  And then we've got all our different acts here that make it as legal as well.
[00:34:34.572 --> 00:34:41.657]  Hillary Clinton got fined, what was it, $400,000 back in the 90s for violating the Logan Act, and they have similar laws there.
[00:34:41.737 --> 00:34:46.781]  But in England, it's in the newspapers that it looks like what he's doing is illegal, so a real investigation is heating up.
[00:34:47.282 --> 00:34:48.383]  We're going to talk about that, but
[00:34:50.253 --> 00:34:52.734]  I mean, what does he have to do, have like MI6 files officially?
[00:34:52.774 --> 00:34:54.494]  I mean, he's going on with all these files.
[00:34:55.095 --> 00:34:57.755]  It's so, I mean, they're in there setting policy, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:58.656 --> 00:35:01.176]  With the heads of corporations that give them political donations.
[00:35:01.197 --> 00:35:02.017]  This is outrageous.
[00:35:03.057 --> 00:35:09.999]  We're showing that footage right now of Balls doing all this.
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.721]  And again, there's a shot where he's got all the different files up against his chest.
[00:35:14.741 --> 00:35:15.681]  We'll show that in a moment.
[00:35:16.141 --> 00:35:18.082]  And I guess it's not even the security guard, that's the police.
[00:35:20.074 --> 00:35:32.901]  But we're going to also be talking again to Paul Watson coming up at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:35:34.022 --> 00:35:44.608]  But I tell you, the bureaucracy of them trying to put all of us collectively in a control grid prison to protect themselves shows how they're now in a prison as well of their own making.
[00:35:44.948 --> 00:35:48.090]  See, what you try to do to somebody else generally ends up happening to you.
[00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:52.591]  And the globalists have knowledge of how to dominate.
[00:35:52.931 --> 00:36:02.255]  They do not have long-term wisdom of, gee, is this good for my children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren, what I'm doing to humanity?
[00:36:03.696 --> 00:36:07.437]  Well, yes, I'm making my house powerful and great and big, yeah, but I look at your kids.
[00:36:07.718 --> 00:36:09.238]  They're all basically on average messes.
[00:36:11.439 --> 00:36:14.861]  I mean, you are destroying your genetic line.
[00:36:14.941 --> 00:36:17.061]  You are committing a crime against your name.
[00:36:17.282 --> 00:36:18.162]  It's just not good.
[00:36:20.606 --> 00:36:23.126]  And the argument is, well, I'm not really a bad person.
[00:36:24.547 --> 00:36:29.428]  I'm in a larger corrupt system, and I work within it to try to do better at certain points.
[00:36:29.868 --> 00:36:30.948]  But you never do.
[00:36:32.488 --> 00:36:34.008]  I'm not saying everybody at Bilderberg is evil.
[00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:36.569]  I'm not even saying they run the whole world.
[00:36:36.649 --> 00:36:43.010]  They are a key organization that admits they set up the plan for the European Union, and that's been declassified BBC.
[00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:47.371]  In the 90s reported that, and interviewed the head of the Bilderberg group at the time, Lord Healy.
[00:36:50.638 --> 00:36:54.320]  And they were in, again, the German newspapers two weeks ago bragging that they're the most powerful.
[00:36:55.241 --> 00:36:55.661]  I don't know.
[00:36:56.081 --> 00:37:06.187]  According to Helmut Schmidt in his book, Men in Power as a Political Retrospective, German Chancellor, he said it was probably the most powerful along with Trilateral Commission and Bohemian Grove.
[00:37:07.508 --> 00:37:10.290]  And he went on to say, we actually get a lot done at Bohemian Grove.
[00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:12.131]  And it's my favorite place.
[00:37:13.251 --> 00:37:17.294]  Yeah, because they have sex by night and party and get drunk and make decisions by day.
[00:37:18.962 --> 00:37:21.923]  It is a beautiful area in Northern California, one of the prettiest places on the planet.
[00:37:24.123 --> 00:37:28.684]  But the issue is, we don't like you running our lives and then saying you're not.
[00:37:28.764 --> 00:37:34.906]  See, once we force them to admit they are making a lot of the decisions, then we have to say, what are those decisions?
[00:37:35.386 --> 00:37:37.546]  Oh, you didn't have a right to make those decisions.
[00:37:39.407 --> 00:37:47.669]  And their main decision, and then we're going to our reporters, is, and is on record, and they've already done this in countless third world and old world countries, and are now moving to first world countries,
[00:37:49.451 --> 00:37:59.395]  Like Spain, like Italy, like Germany, like the United States, like the UK, Ireland, Scotland, England.
[00:38:01.515 --> 00:38:04.896]  They are taking the pension funds of private pensioners.
[00:38:05.297 --> 00:38:06.237]  It's their money.
[00:38:06.577 --> 00:38:08.918]  They've already paid taxes on it on average four times.
[00:38:10.754 --> 00:38:23.725]  And they are taking them in increments using the same systems worldwide and getting so arrogant they're now taking money directly out of people's bank accounts in Cyprus and other places and seizing of the hundreds of Greek islands.
[00:38:23.745 --> 00:38:24.265]  There's hundreds.
[00:38:25.306 --> 00:38:26.687]  Oh, you owe me three billion.
[00:38:28.849 --> 00:38:31.071]  I want this island that's valued at four billion.
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:33.980]  And they get this giant Greek island.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.581]  That was in the Daily Mail last year.
[00:38:36.081 --> 00:38:37.481]  And the Associated Press and everywhere else.
[00:38:37.821 --> 00:38:43.382]  And then it turned out, that particular billionaire, he got the government to sign on to cover his derivatives.
[00:38:44.362 --> 00:38:45.142]  Too big to fail.
[00:38:45.262 --> 00:38:48.423]  And then turned around and went, see, now you owe me money.
[00:38:48.983 --> 00:38:50.123]  You bail them out.
[00:38:50.823 --> 00:38:53.484]  And then, but now your money's been given to them.
[00:38:53.844 --> 00:38:55.964]  And now they're the executor and the manager.
[00:38:56.844 --> 00:38:57.624]  And then they go, you know what?
[00:38:57.644 --> 00:38:59.785]  We want to appoint the new leader of Greece.
[00:39:00.125 --> 00:39:01.625]  And we're going to appoint the leader of Spain.
[00:39:03.319 --> 00:39:04.540]  They're moving towards that more and more.
[00:39:04.861 --> 00:39:07.723]  We're going to appoint the leader of Italy.
[00:39:07.743 --> 00:39:08.684]  They actually did that.
[00:39:10.426 --> 00:39:14.630]  And it's just, oh, we now have technocrats appointed, and it's the Bilderberg group.
[00:39:15.331 --> 00:39:20.917]  Bilderberg and Goldman Sachs members, rotating door, revolving door, are now being appointed.
[00:39:22.605 --> 00:39:36.694]  They were appointing people in Iceland to run things but the Icelanders basically rioted and refused to work and do stuff for one year until they got a new government and then they started arresting the finance ministers and found out, guess what, 93% of the money that was owed was not theirs.
[00:39:37.714 --> 00:39:50.442]  It was bankers in England signing them on to their debts and telling 400,000 hard-working Vikings in Iceland
[00:39:52.329 --> 00:40:01.454]  Who were all out there with their bicycles and their kids and all friendly and so nice and good until they were going to lose everything.
[00:40:01.874 --> 00:40:03.635]  And they finally became humans again.
[00:40:03.655 --> 00:40:06.216]  Because they were always humans.
[00:40:06.256 --> 00:40:07.297]  Nice, sweet Vikings.
[00:40:07.657 --> 00:40:11.719]  But then they started acting more like mean Vikings and now they've got their country back.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:16.942]  See, the veneer of civilization wipes off very quickly.
[00:40:17.162 --> 00:40:19.783]  That's why they want police states and checkpoints and nanny states.
[00:40:20.143 --> 00:40:21.364]  Not because they want to protect you.
[00:40:22.785 --> 00:40:23.565]  I was downtown.
[00:40:24.205 --> 00:40:24.825]  I'm going to the guest.
[00:40:26.166 --> 00:40:27.066]  I was downtown.
[00:40:27.366 --> 00:40:31.127]  I guess it was Sunday or yeah, it was Sunday.
[00:40:33.067 --> 00:40:33.847]  Or was it Monday?
[00:40:34.007 --> 00:40:34.708]  Was it the holiday?
[00:40:34.728 --> 00:40:36.388]  I was visiting some friends.
[00:40:37.128 --> 00:40:38.008]  I was out on their balcony.
[00:40:38.028 --> 00:40:38.729]  We're barbecuing.
[00:40:40.049 --> 00:40:42.069]  And a big storm, beautiful storms blow in.
[00:40:42.089 --> 00:40:45.470]  And we're looking at it from, you know, 20 stories up.
[00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:49.771]  And these beautiful storms blow in over Lake Austin, over the river.
[00:40:51.597 --> 00:40:54.358]  And you can see the sun in the distance.
[00:40:54.378 --> 00:40:57.498]  You know, it's one of those stormy days where you can see 30 miles in all directions.
[00:40:57.518 --> 00:41:00.899]  And there was no tornado.
[00:41:00.919 --> 00:41:02.999]  I went in and looked, because the police were acting crazy.
[00:41:03.339 --> 00:41:07.440]  They were running around on speedboats saying, get off the lake, get off the lake, emergency, emergency.
[00:41:08.321 --> 00:41:11.181]  And making kayakers get off and all the rest of this for a rainstorm that was coming in.
[00:41:11.381 --> 00:41:12.421]  So I thought, is there a tornado?
[00:41:13.061 --> 00:41:16.962]  And I ran and, you know, looked on my buddy's computer.
[00:41:19.243 --> 00:41:20.283]  No, there's no tornado coming.
[00:41:22.859 --> 00:41:44.129]  And went back out, was checking on my iPhone, and then we went back in, the storm blew through, ate some barbecue, and walked back out, and it's just barely raining, and there are police running around in Lake Austin and at the parks, and down by their building on loudspeakers saying, don't come outside, it's dangerous, dangerous weather conditions.
[00:41:44.749 --> 00:41:48.691]  I mean, folks, they're now saying don't go outside when it's raining.
[00:41:51.144 --> 00:41:56.589]  And in England they arrest you if you say the word homosexual or girl, because someone said it was hurtful.
[00:41:57.329 --> 00:41:59.631]  And Michelle Obama is telling us what to eat now.
[00:42:00.852 --> 00:42:06.677]  And they are totally destroying the culture, destroying any form of debate.
[00:42:07.038 --> 00:42:15.965]  There's a big video up on Drudge right now, it's also on Infowars.com, with a big comedian and writer, you know, coming out and saying, you know, there's a gay mafia.
[00:42:17.247 --> 00:42:18.528]  And if you even make a joke,
[00:42:19.588 --> 00:42:20.608]  Everybody should be fair game.
[00:42:20.728 --> 00:42:23.789]  You are destroyed and shut down, and that's pretty authoritarian.
[00:42:24.229 --> 00:42:25.009]  That's pretty scary.
[00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:29.350]  In fact, there's a headline, Adam Carolla on gay mafia.
[00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:36.612]  And me, I've never bashed, quote, gays, but if I want to use the scientific term, heterosexual, homosexual, you want to have me arrested?
[00:42:36.632 --> 00:42:38.212]  I mean, you're an authoritarian.
[00:42:38.252 --> 00:42:38.912]  I don't like you.
[00:42:39.252 --> 00:42:47.334]  And not because of your sexual preference, but because you are a control freak trying to use our goodwill to enslave us in free speech, and I don't like that.
[00:42:48.621 --> 00:43:03.208]  And I'll start, you know, really coming after people if they want to try to sit there and dictate everything, because you're an authoritarian being used by the globalist authoritarians with political correctness to silence any form of dissent or free speech, and I don't want to live in North Korea.
[00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:17.294]  Now, while we're all busy debating the next revolution, transgender, because they've normalized everything else now, just as a political fighting point, then it'll be bestiality, on and on and on, just to create a fight is the whole issue.
[00:43:19.363 --> 00:43:28.427]  While we're all busy debating that all day, the troops are killing themselves 24 a day, that's every hour, and most of it's because they can't get healthcare and they're being treated like crap.
[00:43:29.428 --> 00:43:32.829]  If vets are treated good, they tend to not commit suicide in a just society.
[00:43:33.069 --> 00:43:34.490]  If they're treated badly, they flip out.
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:37.501]  And no one's been abused more than this current generation.
[00:43:37.761 --> 00:43:39.561]  We hear about Greatest Generation, World War II vets.
[00:43:39.821 --> 00:43:43.102]  Yeah, my grandfathers were in World War II, but they both served a couple TURs.
[00:43:43.202 --> 00:43:44.463]  One of them one TUR, the other two TURs.
[00:43:45.483 --> 00:43:51.464]  I mean, it was some rough fighting too, but I mean, I know people that have served 20 TURs in combat like my cousin.
[00:43:51.845 --> 00:43:53.045]  Volunteer.
[00:43:53.065 --> 00:43:53.645]  31 years U.S.
[00:43:53.705 --> 00:43:53.905]  Army.
[00:43:54.985 --> 00:43:56.106]  And he is a machine.
[00:43:56.566 --> 00:43:58.466]  He wouldn't probably do well outside of it.
[00:43:59.167 --> 00:44:01.387]  Every time he gets out for six months or something, he goes and re-ups.
[00:44:01.707 --> 00:44:02.508]  He just can't help it.
[00:44:02.608 --> 00:44:03.608]  This is all he knows how to do.
[00:44:05.236 --> 00:44:14.978]  I mean, if your car's got a problem, or your gun's got an issue, or you want you to come fix your roof at 2am, the guy just fixes things, and does things, and just carries things, and just is ready.
[00:44:15.179 --> 00:44:16.799]  I mean, just a machine.
[00:44:17.959 --> 00:44:21.500]  Beyond my dad, because my dad's from the same country, you know, hard-working people.
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.301]  He loves to work, he loves to get stuff done.
[00:44:23.561 --> 00:44:28.802]  I mean, I've got family members, not just one, but a bunch who are farm boys, who are just machines, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:31.843 --> 00:44:34.765]  And they can adjust, they can handle it because they're so tough.
[00:44:35.325 --> 00:44:35.965]  I couldn't handle it.
[00:44:36.526 --> 00:44:41.409]  The average person can't go see three, four hardcore terrorists and then come back and be treated like crap by the VA.
[00:44:41.429 --> 00:44:42.529]  They're going to go blow their head off.
[00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:46.932]  And there's an attitude of anti-humanism
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:50.081]  Anti-humans are good.
[00:44:50.281 --> 00:44:51.942]  In the globalists, it's trickling down now.
[00:44:52.442 --> 00:44:53.643]  And that's what you hear at the VA.
[00:44:54.003 --> 00:44:55.844]  They go, we'll just take these vets out and shoot them.
[00:44:55.864 --> 00:44:56.905]  They're a bunch of scum.
[00:44:56.925 --> 00:44:57.965]  Oh, they're getting welfare.
[00:44:58.445 --> 00:44:59.646]  Oh, they want surgeries.
[00:45:00.106 --> 00:45:01.247]  Oh, just get, you know.
[00:45:01.367 --> 00:45:06.269]  It's because they've put people in place that will take the funding away and siphon it off.
[00:45:06.489 --> 00:45:08.310]  They don't want to take care of the veterans.
[00:45:09.571 --> 00:45:11.572]  Of course it got worse under Shinseki.
[00:45:11.892 --> 00:45:13.013]  That's the directive.
[00:45:14.375 --> 00:45:15.896]  Of course it got worse under Obama.
[00:45:16.096 --> 00:45:17.457]  We've got death panels now.
[00:45:17.717 --> 00:45:19.698]  The VA is the model of everything.
[00:45:22.119 --> 00:45:24.381]  People go, but government wants to give us something free, help old ladies.
[00:45:24.421 --> 00:45:25.501]  They use your soft heart.
[00:45:25.801 --> 00:45:27.743]  They want control of health care to run your life.
[00:45:28.963 --> 00:45:33.046]  And it's come out of the Club of Rome and Bilderberg and the Trilateral Commission and these groups.
[00:45:33.366 --> 00:45:40.650]  The people that write the Obamacare to bankrupt the old system, to get control of your life, to give you less health care for more money.
[00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:42.051]  It's a screw job!
[00:45:43.004 --> 00:45:45.705]  Because evil people don't like to manage stuff and compete.
[00:45:46.146 --> 00:45:50.928]  So they argue that an Agenda 21 imploding society is something they built and designed.
[00:45:51.508 --> 00:46:00.253]  All they're doing is actuarying and sucking off a collapse, blowing up the building and saying what artists they are in command destruction.
[00:46:01.093 --> 00:46:05.575]  Because they're not good managers, they're not good people, they're not good leaders.
[00:46:05.916 --> 00:46:08.457]  They don't want to compete with the Renaissance.
[00:46:09.051 --> 00:46:10.131]  They are the dark age.
[00:46:10.351 --> 00:46:11.472]  They are neo-feudalism.
[00:46:11.692 --> 00:46:20.014]  And the Club of Rome in 1967, I've gone to the UT library, I show shots of it in my film Endgame, they say they want to recreate neo-feudalism.
[00:46:20.794 --> 00:46:22.835]  They want to recreate feudalism.
[00:46:24.075 --> 00:46:25.395]  I mean, these people are scum!
[00:46:26.076 --> 00:46:34.358]  And then they're saving the earth by screwing it up, and I'm supposed to crawl in some ditch and just give up my destiny, and my children's destiny, and your destiny?
[00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:37.280]  It doesn't mean you have to accept my destiny.
[00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:39.421]  It doesn't mean you have to accept my view of the world.
[00:46:39.601 --> 00:46:45.483]  But believe me, folks, you better decide what you want, because they've already decided you're not in the future.
[00:46:46.543 --> 00:46:58.466]  And if they can treat foster kids and minorities and veterans, anybody in their clutches, like absolute hell with secret experiments and all the control and all the dumbing down, they'll do it to you next.
[00:46:58.786 --> 00:47:00.707]  And they are doing it to you already.
[00:47:03.001 --> 00:47:04.622]  These people are the scum of the earth.
[00:47:04.662 --> 00:47:12.205]  Now we're going to have David Knight with us, 15 minutes into the next hour, then we're going to have Paul Watson with us, then open phones the full next hour.
[00:47:12.245 --> 00:47:16.186]  There's so much breaking Bilderberg news at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:47:16.486 --> 00:47:28.111]  We need some big master coverage article that has the right headlines so it captures people's attention, because this is sensational information for Liberty and exposing tyranny, but there's just so much of it, it's all just kind of blurbed out.
[00:47:28.451 --> 00:47:30.812]  We've got Schmidt caught on video and photos, we've got him
[00:47:31.252 --> 00:47:38.279]  The head of Google, we've got them with files falling out, clearly doing official business that needs to be investigated.
[00:47:38.299 --> 00:47:40.241]  There's already criminal investigations in England.
[00:47:40.541 --> 00:47:41.642]  This puts it over the top.
[00:47:41.702 --> 00:47:45.786]  Balls with official files going in, claiming they're just having impromptu cocktail parties.
[00:47:46.226 --> 00:47:47.367]  Clearly they're setting policy.
[00:47:47.567 --> 00:47:48.528]  We need articles on that.
[00:47:51.571 --> 00:47:54.353]  They're deciding the future of NSA spying worldwide.
[00:47:54.613 --> 00:47:55.594]  That's come out in their agenda.
[00:47:55.614 --> 00:47:56.615]  That should be investigated.
[00:47:57.335 --> 00:47:58.396]  Policy's being set.
[00:47:58.456 --> 00:48:00.118]  That's really the angle that should be looked at here.
[00:48:00.938 --> 00:48:09.805]  And their anti-human move to cut the pension funds and not give vets care and to quote, cut entitlements.
[00:48:10.906 --> 00:48:12.087]  Yeah, they can cut entitlements.
[00:48:12.107 --> 00:48:14.669]  How about their banker bailouts first, you see?
[00:48:16.328 --> 00:48:21.771]  These are the people setting the agenda, and we've got bombshell HD video and photos.
[00:48:21.791 --> 00:48:31.076]  We need to get it all condensed and boiled down into one big article dealing with official business being set, and there needs to be a serious investigation, and the people need to push for it.
[00:48:31.336 --> 00:48:32.817]  That's what the Independent and others are saying.
[00:48:33.197 --> 00:48:34.598]  We're the Bilderberg experts.
[00:48:34.938 --> 00:48:39.461]  We need the big articles on this and the videos on this, boiling it all together.
[00:48:42.153 --> 00:48:56.299]  Now, we're going to have a break in a few minutes, but I want to come back right now after the break to David Knight for 15 minutes into the next hour and kind of go over all the stuff that's been breaking at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:00.961]  But I need Watson and others to do that big article now.
[00:49:01.001 --> 00:49:06.983]  Now's the time for over the weekend to really boil down that why this is bad.
[00:49:07.003 --> 00:49:09.164]  Now, we're going to have a break in a moment.
[00:49:09.184 --> 00:49:10.105]  I first want to say something.
[00:49:11.454 --> 00:49:19.643]  We fund this operation selling incredibly high-quality stainless steel gravity-fed filters that cut out the glyphosates and fluoride and annihilate the competition.
[00:49:20.263 --> 00:49:24.368]  And my point is there's just no reason to buy any other water filter but ProPure with the G2.0.
[00:49:24.868 --> 00:49:29.893]  For the price, it's the same price as the competitor or lower with 10% off promo code water and
[00:49:30.854 --> 00:49:43.121]  It'll help you and your family at a massive level and it'll fund this vicious truth-telling, open bias towards truth, open pro-human, pro-God, pro-family, pro-honor and chivalry.
[00:49:43.821 --> 00:49:47.123]  We need your support and you get a great product at the same time.
[00:49:47.143 --> 00:49:48.344]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:49:49.604 --> 00:49:50.285]  We only got
[00:49:51.371 --> 00:49:54.655]  A few thousand test run bottles of the Super Feminine Vitality.
[00:49:55.196 --> 00:49:56.377]  It's almost sold out.
[00:49:56.898 --> 00:49:58.640]  It will be sold out by next week.
[00:49:59.041 --> 00:50:01.324]  And it will probably take three weeks to a month to get more of it.
[00:50:01.684 --> 00:50:06.250]  And we're having even bigger responses with women's energy workout, libido, with this, than men have a super meal.
[00:50:07.895 --> 00:50:10.356]  And Supermail had a bigger effect on women, and we didn't know why.
[00:50:11.016 --> 00:50:12.697]  I guess women are more sensitive to these herbs.
[00:50:13.097 --> 00:50:16.298]  Now with a feminine one for women, it's even crazier from what we've seen.
[00:50:16.578 --> 00:50:18.739]  Find out for yourself, regardless if you're supporting with transmission.
[00:50:19.059 --> 00:50:20.299]  If you want it, it's going to sell out.
[00:50:20.679 --> 00:50:26.861]  Superfemalevitalityinfowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:50:27.902 --> 00:50:29.482]  When it sells out, there's still the Supermail.
[00:50:29.502 --> 00:50:30.603]  We have plenty of that in stock.
[00:50:30.983 --> 00:50:33.984]  And then we have the new X2, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:41.493]  That is the purple, original, millions of years old, iodine crystals from 7 to 12,000 feet.
[00:50:41.773 --> 00:50:42.853]  We're the only ones that have it.
[00:50:44.114 --> 00:50:46.154]  And it turns bright purple on paper.
[00:50:46.474 --> 00:50:47.675]  All other iodines turn black.
[00:50:48.235 --> 00:50:49.216]  And we've talked to scientists.
[00:50:49.236 --> 00:50:50.256]  That's because they're bound.
[00:50:50.316 --> 00:50:51.296]  It's not real nascent.
[00:50:51.657 --> 00:50:54.118]  The reason this is so special is it goes right into your blood.
[00:50:54.998 --> 00:50:56.478]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:50:56.519 --> 00:50:57.359]  We have plenty of it.
[00:50:58.450 --> 00:51:00.194]  But it may still sell out in about two weeks.
[00:51:00.214 --> 00:51:01.417]  I don't know how soon we can get more.
[00:51:01.718 --> 00:51:05.626]  If you want to stock up on it and support the broadcast, nobody's got iodine like this.
[00:51:06.047 --> 00:51:06.067]  X2.
[00:51:07.119 --> 00:51:12.703]  What if there was a secret powder that if consumed would awaken your inner genius and raise your IQ?
[00:51:12.823 --> 00:51:17.266]  What if this powerful secret powder could not only make you smarter, but happier as well?
[00:51:17.526 --> 00:51:21.329]  What if the secret powder could lessen withdrawal symptoms for most addictions?
[00:51:21.549 --> 00:51:23.671]  Do you think that no such powder exists?
[00:51:23.891 --> 00:51:24.231]  Wrong!
[00:51:24.391 --> 00:51:26.032]  The secret powder does exist!
[00:51:26.192 --> 00:51:27.453]  Want to know its secrets?
[00:51:27.593 --> 00:51:31.436]  Then go to thesecretpowder.com and get your free sample today!
[00:51:31.496 --> 00:51:35.079]  Go to thesecretpowder.com and change your life forever!
[00:51:36.536 --> 00:51:45.782]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:51:45.822 --> 00:51:46.562]  This capitalism?
[00:51:46.622 --> 00:51:52.746]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:51:52.786 --> 00:51:56.428]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:51:56.488 --> 00:51:57.409]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:51:57.429 --> 00:51:58.469]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:51:58.489 --> 00:51:58.749]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:51:58.809 --> 00:51:59.150]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:52:06.576 --> 00:52:07.577]  Attention America!
[00:52:07.897 --> 00:52:15.062]  Within a little-known government document is devastating information that could cost the United States its most valuable asset.
[00:52:15.523 --> 00:52:18.885]  My name is Jeff Opdycke, former reporter for the Wall Street Journal.
[00:52:18.905 --> 00:52:27.672]  I've uncovered shocking evidence within the details of document FT-900, revealing the largest cover-up of President Obama's career.
[00:52:28.092 --> 00:52:31.134]  This will have a substantial impact on our nation.
[00:52:31.574 --> 00:52:34.737]  Millions of Americans will fall into poverty overnight.
[00:52:35.257 --> 00:52:42.142]  A recent report from the Treasury Department said an event of this nature has, quote, the potential to be catastrophic.
[00:52:42.583 --> 00:52:52.070]  Within a matter of weeks, the way of life for millions of Americans will be destroyed, and the standard of living will be like nothing this country has seen in nearly a century.
[00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:56.213]  To learn how you can protect yourself and your family from this government attack,
[00:52:56.653 --> 00:53:00.614]  Visit www.obamasecret1.com.
[00:53:00.995 --> 00:53:05.156]  Again, that's www.obamasecret1.com.
[00:53:05.796 --> 00:53:08.177]  This is Scottish John for InfoWars.com.
[00:53:08.297 --> 00:53:14.779]  I know that most of you here in this commercial already know about the New World Order, eugenics, and all the other issues covered here at InfoWars.
[00:53:14.959 --> 00:53:17.540]  The question is, do your friends and family know?
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:19.501]  If not, then I want to know why.
[00:53:19.681 --> 00:53:21.902]  Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with some people.
[00:53:21.982 --> 00:53:26.143]  They might call you names, or they just want to talk about sports, or soap operas.
[00:53:26.423 --> 00:53:27.424]  I say, so what?
[00:53:27.564 --> 00:53:29.585]  There's a battle going on out there right now.
[00:53:29.785 --> 00:53:32.906]  The ammunition is information, and the soldiers are you.
[00:53:33.146 --> 00:53:37.248]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[00:53:37.388 --> 00:53:43.071]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand years, and I'm still fighting.
[00:53:43.231 --> 00:53:46.232]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're gonna lose everything.
[00:53:46.432 --> 00:53:48.133]  The Info War is worldwide.
[00:53:48.253 --> 00:53:52.375]  Tell your friends about Info Wars, and let them know that Info Wars doesn't print bull.
[00:53:52.575 --> 00:53:56.197]  It's real journalism and news, backed up by documented facts.
[00:53:56.257 --> 00:54:03.322]  Step up and take your friends and family to InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and PlanetInfoWars.com.
[00:54:03.482 --> 00:54:05.103]  The truth will set them free!
[00:54:08.405 --> 00:54:13.549]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:14.229 --> 00:54:16.511]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:26.512 --> 00:54:31.093]  Bilderberg didn't want us to know they existed, because then we'd start looking into them.
[00:54:31.233 --> 00:54:32.333]  I know I'm stating the obvious.
[00:54:33.313 --> 00:54:36.754]  So we've been looking into them, now we've forced the public to know they exist.
[00:54:37.014 --> 00:54:40.274]  That raises the credibility of what they call conspiracy theorists, i.e.
[00:54:40.314 --> 00:54:41.235]  people that ask questions.
[00:54:42.835 --> 00:54:50.876]  So we're now being heretics and showing that the heretics are actually the good people, telling the truth against the state-run religion of mindlessness, and 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:54:52.617 --> 00:54:54.217]  And Michelle Obama tells your kids what to eat.
[00:54:55.754 --> 00:54:56.735]  I'm rebelling against this.
[00:54:56.915 --> 00:54:57.775]  I'm not complying.
[00:54:58.036 --> 00:55:00.497]  And I'm decrying it with my First Amendment.
[00:55:01.678 --> 00:55:03.860]  A powerful weapon comes before the second.
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:07.742]  And so I need all the writers and other talk show hosts who are hearing me.
[00:55:07.982 --> 00:55:10.144]  You want to bring them down, point out Ed Balls.
[00:55:10.584 --> 00:55:14.307]  We have the videos of him being confronted by myself and Watson, denying he's doing state-run business.
[00:55:14.627 --> 00:55:18.710]  Now we have what looks like state-run media files, clearly going in for serious policy meetings.
[00:55:20.387 --> 00:55:22.790]  Not to play tiddlywinks, there needs to be an investigation.
[00:55:23.011 --> 00:55:24.473]  We list the British law.
[00:55:24.913 --> 00:55:26.155]  The Independent's already done it.
[00:55:26.415 --> 00:55:29.039]  Now we have him showing he's doing official meetings.
[00:55:30.061 --> 00:55:31.402]  And then there's a bunch of other issues.
[00:55:32.898 --> 00:55:36.822]  And then we can crack these people wide open, but we have to believe and not be pessimists.
[00:55:37.382 --> 00:55:41.826]  If you're a pessimist, study came out this week, you're three times more likely to have dementia and Alzheimer's.
[00:55:42.587 --> 00:55:43.688]  People are in a coma.
[00:55:43.888 --> 00:55:45.009]  You're not really living.
[00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:48.232]  We have to, all of us, wake up and realize what's happening.
[00:55:48.613 --> 00:55:51.375]  We've got a lot of videos coming up with you in the next hour, David Knight.
[00:55:52.372 --> 00:55:54.554]  Lynn Paul Watson joins us at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:55:54.794 --> 00:56:04.880]  We're going to walk through it all, but give us an update of what's coming up in the next hour and some of the highlights since we talked to you 24 hours a day, 24 hours yesterday, as you report from Bilderberg 2014.
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:13.066]  Well, Alex, they're toasting champagne here and somebody's just come over to the fence to talk, so we're going to go see what he has to say.
[00:56:13.086 --> 00:56:18.630]  Oh, it's one of the security people telling you not to put cameras in.
[00:56:19.454 --> 00:56:21.495]  Go ahead and talk to him.
[00:56:21.795 --> 00:56:27.278]  In the Netherlands you were always, like I think in all countries, you were always busy with little things.
[00:56:27.478 --> 00:56:27.759]  Yeah.
[00:56:28.499 --> 00:56:31.360]  And now we get three days of discussing big issues.
[00:56:31.561 --> 00:56:31.921]  Very intense.
[00:56:31.941 --> 00:56:33.021]  That's a Bilderberg group member.
[00:56:33.081 --> 00:56:33.662]  Ask him who he is.
[00:56:34.222 --> 00:56:35.142]  Very intense.
[00:56:35.403 --> 00:56:35.623]  Yeah.
[00:56:35.703 --> 00:56:36.863]  It starts at 8 o'clock in the morning.
[00:56:37.084 --> 00:56:37.684]  Ask him who he is.
[00:56:39.085 --> 00:56:41.346]  Okay, this is a Dietrich Samson and who are you with?
[00:56:41.907 --> 00:56:43.367]  I'm from the Dutch Labour Party.
[00:56:43.427 --> 00:56:44.228]  I'm a politician.
[00:56:44.668 --> 00:56:49.810]  Oh, but are you here in your formal or informal function?
[00:56:50.031 --> 00:56:53.252]  Well, I'm formal because I'm being a politician.
[00:56:53.632 --> 00:56:55.854]  You're 24-7, so there's no way of...
[00:56:57.034 --> 00:56:58.215]  Exiting my role.
[00:56:58.255 --> 00:57:05.420]  So let's say, if your Prime Minister asked you what you were talking about here, you would surely tell him everything.
[00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:05.720]  I would.
[00:57:05.821 --> 00:57:14.247]  Could I ask whether the heads of banks such as HSBC, David Flynn, is he there in his formal or informal capacity?
[00:57:14.287 --> 00:57:14.667]  Is he there?
[00:57:14.907 --> 00:57:15.487]  I'm not sure.
[00:57:15.527 --> 00:57:17.388]  You know the list better than I do.
[00:57:17.448 --> 00:57:19.609]  It's 106 participants and it's only one.
[00:57:19.889 --> 00:57:22.590]  Peter Sutherland from Goldman Sachs International.
[00:57:22.890 --> 00:57:25.391]  Now, is he formal or informal?
[00:57:25.431 --> 00:57:28.832]  Is he still head of Goldman Sachs International?
[00:57:28.872 --> 00:57:29.093]  Is he?
[00:57:29.153 --> 00:57:29.973]  He still is, alright.
[00:57:31.373 --> 00:57:33.414]  I don't know, actually.
[00:57:33.574 --> 00:57:37.616]  He's a member of British American Business, the lobbying group.
[00:57:37.696 --> 00:57:40.597]  Let me explain.
[00:57:40.617 --> 00:57:42.538]  There's scientists here.
[00:57:42.558 --> 00:57:44.459]  There's politicians, like me.
[00:57:44.579 --> 00:57:46.480]  There's business people here.
[00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:48.380]  Are you being lobbied?
[00:58:00.114 --> 00:58:00.775]  No.
[00:58:00.855 --> 00:58:01.935]  But TTIP is a nice discussion.
[00:58:02.015 --> 00:58:03.036]  It's a good discussion to have.
[00:58:03.076 --> 00:58:04.097]  Have you heard that discussion?
[00:58:04.117 --> 00:58:06.678]  Yeah, well, not here at this moment.
[00:58:07.078 --> 00:58:08.599]  Ask him about trying to prop up the euro.
[00:58:08.619 --> 00:58:10.000]  We know that's what they're really talking about.
[00:58:10.361 --> 00:58:10.961]  Ask him about that.
[00:58:12.782 --> 00:58:14.103]  That's like everybody.
[00:58:14.163 --> 00:58:17.285]  I think, like you, we are worried about what happens there.
[00:58:17.325 --> 00:58:20.387]  I mean, nobody wants an armed conflict and it's already happening.
[00:58:20.407 --> 00:58:22.088]  Have you had an intelligence sharing discussion?
[00:58:22.768 --> 00:58:22.828]  No.
[00:58:22.868 --> 00:58:24.269]  Ask him about propping up the EU.
[00:58:24.850 --> 00:58:26.951]  Are you talking about propping up the... Or the day after, I'm not sure.
[00:58:26.971 --> 00:58:28.412]  Are you talking about propping up the euro?
[00:58:29.244 --> 00:58:29.384]  No.
[00:58:29.904 --> 00:58:30.065]  No?
[00:58:30.425 --> 00:58:31.325]  We talked about Europe.
[00:58:31.625 --> 00:58:33.347]  We talked about what to do next for Europe.
[00:58:33.587 --> 00:58:42.812]  And basically what I said in the discussion is that people are fed up with discussions about treaty change and euro and whatever.
[00:58:43.352 --> 00:58:45.053]  Oh my gosh, I hate having to go to break right now.
[00:58:45.193 --> 00:58:45.994]  Oh my goodness.
[00:58:46.494 --> 00:58:50.256]  Folks, I told everybody the issue is that they're setting official business inside.
[00:58:50.377 --> 00:58:52.898]  We're getting footage of this so you'll all get to hear it.
[00:58:52.938 --> 00:58:55.960]  Major breaking news as the leader of the Labour Party for a major country.
[00:58:57.591 --> 00:58:59.352]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grew.
[00:58:59.893 --> 00:59:06.857]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[00:59:07.297 --> 00:59:17.724]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[00:59:18.145 --> 00:59:27.371]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[00:59:28.091 --> 00:59:31.514]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[00:59:32.154 --> 00:59:35.617]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[00:59:35.937 --> 00:59:37.478]  Experience the new formula.
[00:59:37.999 --> 00:59:39.940]  Experience the ancient purity.
[00:59:40.561 --> 00:59:41.501]  Shield your family.
[00:59:41.882 --> 00:59:43.263]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:59:43.703 --> 00:59:46.305]  Available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:59:46.865 --> 00:59:50.848]  X2 from InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:59:59.767 --> 01:00:01.689]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:02.149 --> 01:00:05.051]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:11.637 --> 01:00:12.277]  Big Brother.
[01:00:12.958 --> 01:00:13.978]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:14.719 --> 01:00:15.800]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.281]  You want answers?
[01:00:18.062 --> 01:00:18.982]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:19.603 --> 01:00:23.246]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:23.806 --> 01:00:27.890]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.067 --> 01:00:32.468]  Alright, we only got him ID'd once.
[01:00:32.528 --> 01:00:33.930]  He's behind the Bilderberg fence.
[01:00:34.010 --> 01:00:36.934]  He's the leader of a major labor party, Dietrich something.
[01:00:37.435 --> 01:00:38.656]  We're looking up his name right now.
[01:00:38.696 --> 01:00:40.459]  I believe David Knight can interrupt right now.
[01:00:40.499 --> 01:00:44.744]  He can hear me down the Skype and recap and then formally...
[01:00:45.465 --> 01:00:49.028]  But in front of the reporters that are there that are asking their questions, they're somewhat good.
[01:00:49.068 --> 01:00:51.050]  They're asking about him in official capacity.
[01:00:51.350 --> 01:00:53.572]  He admitted he's operating in official capacity.
[01:00:54.293 --> 01:00:56.054]  That may mean in his country that's not illegal.
[01:00:56.195 --> 01:00:56.875]  I doubt that.
[01:00:57.396 --> 01:00:59.818]  When he said we're not trying to prop up the euro, he said no!
[01:01:00.398 --> 01:01:00.679]  Nein!
[01:01:01.279 --> 01:01:02.240]  Which shows they are.
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:03.561]  That's what they're really trying to do.
[01:01:03.821 --> 01:01:05.923]  That's their main global takeover system with NATO.
[01:01:06.564 --> 01:01:08.045]  I want to ask him some questions.
[01:01:08.285 --> 01:01:09.226]  David Knight, can you hear me?
[01:01:09.466 --> 01:01:10.627]  It's Dietrich Samsom.
[01:01:11.688 --> 01:01:15.192]  And he is the leader Dutch politician of the Labour Party.
[01:01:15.493 --> 01:01:17.154]  That's the biggest party in the Netherlands.
[01:01:17.194 --> 01:01:20.218]  So, that guy is very powerful in his country.
[01:01:21.639 --> 01:01:22.300]  Let's talk to him.
[01:01:23.081 --> 01:01:23.682]  Go ahead, David.
[01:01:23.702 --> 01:01:24.643]  David, get some questions in.
[01:01:25.441 --> 01:01:28.862]  You know, who knows, you might be having more, you might be invited back, let's hope.
[01:01:28.902 --> 01:01:32.964]  He's also the leader of the Parliament, he's the Speaker of the House, basically.
[01:01:33.324 --> 01:01:34.405]  How do they structure it?
[01:01:34.465 --> 01:01:40.327]  Do they have the kind of experts on a panel, giving presentations?
[01:01:40.387 --> 01:01:46.730]  It's very classical, you could say it's very boring, but it's like normal, like lots of conferences, you have experts on a panel.
[01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:50.772]  Yeah, he's a Greenpeace-er, that means carbon taxer, leftist.
[01:01:51.332 --> 01:01:53.934]  Are you an expert for any of these particular problems?
[01:01:53.974 --> 01:01:55.315]  Good, yeah, you have to be vocal.
[01:01:55.335 --> 01:01:57.077]  You have to show yourself.
[01:02:03.114 --> 01:02:05.575]  Because there's no media there, you don't have to perform.
[01:02:06.195 --> 01:02:07.455]  That's nice.
[01:02:07.556 --> 01:02:11.677]  That's the advantage of having no cameras inside.
[01:02:11.757 --> 01:02:13.217]  There's no transparency.
[01:02:13.758 --> 01:02:15.758]  The advantage is that everybody can speak freely.
[01:02:15.858 --> 01:02:26.082]  Do you feel a little worried that when people at such a government official and people like... This has never happened before, folks, what's happening right now.
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:28.821]  At the meeting.
[01:02:28.841 --> 01:02:30.861]  I think he's even violated an internal agreement.
[01:02:31.082 --> 01:02:32.602]  But they know it's all blown wide open now.
[01:02:33.322 --> 01:02:34.243]  Oh, I wish I could ask questions.
[01:02:35.683 --> 01:02:36.463]  She's ready.
[01:02:36.483 --> 01:02:37.224]  You can ask questions.
[01:02:37.504 --> 01:02:38.164]  Carbon taxes.
[01:02:38.384 --> 01:02:39.425]  Guarantee you that's on the agenda.
[01:02:40.305 --> 01:02:41.625]  They're not speaking...
[01:02:49.148 --> 01:02:50.769]  Completely free.
[01:02:50.929 --> 01:02:53.591]  More free than when there's a camera.
[01:02:53.651 --> 01:03:01.675]  I love it that politicians are having frank and free discussions, but not in front of Lazard, or Goldman Sachs, or HSBC.
[01:03:02.155 --> 01:03:02.675]  It's even better.
[01:03:02.715 --> 01:03:07.298]  Why should they know?
[01:03:07.538 --> 01:03:12.861]  As politicians, I talk about, as a politician worried about banks, I talk about the need for banks.
[01:03:12.881 --> 01:03:14.782]  Ask him about LIBOR and carbon taxes.
[01:03:14.822 --> 01:03:16.303]  Tell David to do that or put the earpiece in.
[01:03:17.262 --> 01:03:18.143]  I want them to behave.
[01:03:18.443 --> 01:03:22.066]  Can you tell us, have you talked about LIBOR, the LIBOR scandal, or carbon taxes?
[01:03:22.646 --> 01:03:27.951]  No, I think the LIBOR scandal is a good example of banks not behaving.
[01:03:28.211 --> 01:03:30.032]  Yes, in fact... It's a good example.
[01:03:30.132 --> 01:03:30.753]  I would say so.
[01:03:30.913 --> 01:03:32.134]  Yeah, I would say so, too.
[01:03:32.154 --> 01:03:40.481]  Martin Bajius, who is on the steering committee, actually had to resign from CEO Barclays... Bring up the Lockheed scandal and Prince Bernhard.
[01:03:40.501 --> 01:03:41.542]  That'll hit him hard.
[01:03:42.162 --> 01:03:44.183]  There was a Dutch bank which was very trusted.
[01:03:44.423 --> 01:03:48.445]  Now, the guy who started this, Prince Bernhard, he was caught up in a Lockheed scandal.
[01:03:48.945 --> 01:03:49.625]  Do you know about that?
[01:03:49.685 --> 01:03:51.806]  Yeah, I know about it, but it was in the 70s.
[01:03:51.866 --> 01:03:54.248]  I mean, I read it, but it was before I was born, actually.
[01:03:54.268 --> 01:04:00.790]  Well, you know, before you were born, they plotted the euro, as well as the European Union, according to them.
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:09.141]  Alright, we got bad Skype.
[01:04:09.161 --> 01:04:10.402]  Just get him one more message.
[01:04:10.422 --> 01:04:11.223]  The crew's doing a great job.
[01:04:11.243 --> 01:04:13.005]  I'm just... I'm not saying he planned it.
[01:04:13.045 --> 01:04:14.466]  I'm saying that Bilderberg did.
[01:04:14.807 --> 01:04:17.349]  So, we believe that there's real policy being crafted here.
[01:04:17.389 --> 01:04:19.511]  Maybe not in the discussion groups that you're part of.
[01:04:19.531 --> 01:04:21.273]  I don't think policy's crafted here.
[01:04:21.333 --> 01:04:25.057]  Bilderberg bragged to the German news last week they're the most powerful and they do set policy.
[01:04:25.858 --> 01:04:26.478]  Throw it in his face.
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:35.208]  In a German paper just last week, a Bilderberg member said that he felt that this was far more important than Davos, that Davos was just a PR group.
[01:04:35.268 --> 01:04:40.454]  I cannot compare it, I wasn't at Davos, but I think it's not, it's a similar type of meeting.
[01:04:40.895 --> 01:04:42.717]  Alright David, we're going to break.
[01:04:42.817 --> 01:04:44.919]  Grilling, we're going to come back, I want to hear what happens after.
[01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:46.782]  Keep grilling, this is a big deal.
[01:04:48.715 --> 01:04:50.415]  Get his take on NSA spying.
[01:04:50.536 --> 01:04:51.956]  That reporter leads on the real agenda.
[01:04:52.276 --> 01:04:56.559]  They're deciding between the countries right now what they're going to do to try to cover this up.
[01:04:56.679 --> 01:04:57.779]  Ask about NSA.
[01:04:58.340 --> 01:04:58.940]  Nail him down.
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.021]  Say, what's the real agenda?
[01:05:00.481 --> 01:05:01.281]  We're going to come right back.
[01:05:01.321 --> 01:05:02.822]  This is big Bilderberg coverage.
[01:05:03.062 --> 01:05:03.722]  Through the fence.
[01:05:04.423 --> 01:05:06.304]  Talking to the most powerful Dutch.
[01:05:06.884 --> 01:05:09.465]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:05:09.726 --> 01:05:14.608]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:05:14.868 --> 01:05:22.732]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:05:22.973 --> 01:05:27.295]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:05:27.515 --> 01:05:31.317]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:05:31.457 --> 01:05:37.158]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:05:37.418 --> 01:05:40.199]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:05:40.579 --> 01:05:45.800]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from MyPatriotSupply.
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:53.982]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[01:06:06.764 --> 01:06:12.868]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forklift situation?
[01:06:12.888 --> 01:06:16.210]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:17.931]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[01:06:17.971 --> 01:06:24.235]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spears.
[01:06:24.335 --> 01:06:30.239]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[01:06:30.379 --> 01:06:34.142]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:06:34.342 --> 01:06:37.224]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:06:37.244 --> 01:06:45.430]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:06:45.690 --> 01:06:47.732]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:06:47.792 --> 01:06:48.833]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:06:49.193 --> 01:06:57.943]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[01:07:06.471 --> 01:07:07.251]  I don't know what it is.
[01:07:07.471 --> 01:07:09.232]  Ralph just won't pay any attention to me.
[01:07:09.352 --> 01:07:13.293]  When he comes home from work, all he ever does is play video games and go to sleep.
[01:07:13.473 --> 01:07:14.713]  It's like I don't even exist.
[01:07:15.073 --> 01:07:16.874]  Oh Betty, that's just awful.
[01:07:17.014 --> 01:07:18.214]  Does this seem familiar?
[01:07:18.394 --> 01:07:20.975]  If the answer to this question is yes, then listen carefully.
[01:07:21.115 --> 01:07:26.356]  Toxic pesticides, GMO foods and additives, BPA plastics, contaminated water supplies.
[01:07:26.556 --> 01:07:31.437]  Many of these toxic additives are deliberately engineered to attack and weaken human masculinity.
[01:07:31.577 --> 01:07:34.058]  It's part of the eugenics population control movement.
[01:07:34.278 --> 01:07:34.718]  Look it up.
[01:07:34.978 --> 01:07:41.662]  If men are more interested in online gaming than they are in their wives, a serious population crisis is soon to follow.

[01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:13.246]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:13.587 --> 01:08:15.869]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:33.388 --> 01:08:39.235]  Alright, David Knight is there talking to the leader of the parliament of the Netherlands.
[01:08:40.356 --> 01:08:45.421]  There's a Bilderberg member talking to them through the fence.
[01:08:45.782 --> 01:08:47.423]  This is unprecedented.
[01:08:47.543 --> 01:08:48.805]  Let's go to the feed.
[01:08:50.979 --> 01:08:52.059]  I just want to ask you a quick question.
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:56.101]  There was a question, does privacy exist?
[01:08:56.261 --> 01:08:57.481]  Have they answered that question yet?
[01:08:57.561 --> 01:09:03.643]  Because we have a former head of the NSA and CIA there.
[01:09:03.883 --> 01:09:05.443]  It will be on the agenda in the next days.
[01:09:06.183 --> 01:09:07.043]  It wasn't taken.
[01:09:07.724 --> 01:09:16.186]  Are participants normally discouraged to take out to the media anything that happens in here?
[01:09:16.466 --> 01:09:16.666]  I'm not.
[01:09:17.366 --> 01:09:18.027]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:09:18.147 --> 01:09:20.808]  Why have you approached me?
[01:09:20.869 --> 01:09:21.909]  Are you breaking protocol?
[01:09:21.949 --> 01:09:22.650]  No, no, no.
[01:09:22.670 --> 01:09:23.950]  I'm not breaking protocol.
[01:09:25.431 --> 01:09:26.272]  I'm allowed to do this.
[01:09:26.532 --> 01:09:27.753]  I'm a former Greenpeace activist.
[01:09:28.433 --> 01:09:33.757]  Maybe that's why I understand what happens when you stand outside, behind a gate.
[01:09:34.557 --> 01:09:35.778]  Well, thank you for talking to us.
[01:09:35.858 --> 01:09:36.298]  Appreciate it.
[01:09:36.338 --> 01:09:36.959]  Thank you so much.
[01:09:37.279 --> 01:09:37.579]  Bye-bye.
[01:09:37.719 --> 01:09:39.200]  Alright, Alex.
[01:09:40.241 --> 01:09:41.582]  David Knight, unprecedented.
[01:09:41.602 --> 01:09:43.343]  Give us your take on what we missed during break.
[01:09:44.195 --> 01:09:45.395]  Well, he was the Labour leader.
[01:09:45.455 --> 01:09:46.675]  What was the country that he was from?
[01:09:47.536 --> 01:09:47.916]  Holland.
[01:09:48.136 --> 01:09:48.976]  Yeah, from the Netherlands.
[01:09:49.016 --> 01:09:50.796]  It's the Netherlands.
[01:09:51.016 --> 01:09:52.437]  Social Democrat, Labour leader.
[01:09:52.737 --> 01:09:56.877]  He said he had been a former Greenpeace activist, so that's why he wanted to come out and talk to us.
[01:09:56.917 --> 01:09:58.898]  He said he knows what it's like to be on the outside.
[01:09:59.058 --> 01:10:00.578]  He's Dietrich Samsom.
[01:10:01.318 --> 01:10:02.319]  Yes, yes, that's correct.
[01:10:03.179 --> 01:10:09.900]  Now, you know, Alex, we've talked to him and we had the video of George Ball with all of the paper files.
[01:10:10.675 --> 01:10:14.358]  And I think it's kind of interesting that he had so many paper files.
[01:10:15.299 --> 01:10:18.802]  Because one of the things that they're talking about here is, does privacy exist?
[01:10:18.842 --> 01:10:20.364]  And he said, I asked him about that.
[01:10:20.384 --> 01:10:22.526]  He says, well, that's the next meeting that's coming up right now.
[01:10:22.586 --> 01:10:24.147]  So they're going to find out if privacy exists.
[01:10:24.708 --> 01:10:26.770]  Ed Balls knows privacy doesn't exist.
[01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:34.336]  That's why he's got all of his stuff written down on volume after volume of paperwork, because that's the only thing that's secure anymore.
[01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:34.637]  Why?
[01:10:34.737 --> 01:10:35.558]  Because of men like
[01:10:36.678 --> 01:10:46.044]  The former NSA chief, Keith Alexander and David Petraeus, because they have basically penetrated everybody's personal and private information, and that includes these people.
[01:10:46.525 --> 01:10:54.790]  So they put this stuff on paper, they meet in secret, face to face, so they can say the things that they can't transmit via email.
[01:10:55.410 --> 01:10:57.332]  So that's what's going on here essentially.
[01:10:58.698 --> 01:11:05.600]  The story this morning, the key story this morning, was not people asking, what's going on inside of Bilderberg?
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:12.662]  It wasn't even the Danish people asking, why are we spending millions, the equivalent of millions of dollars, on security here?
[01:11:12.702 --> 01:11:17.423]  Because they've put up a massive amount of barricades, concrete barricades.
[01:11:17.443 --> 01:11:20.384]  They worked essentially 24 hours.
[01:11:20.404 --> 01:11:24.985]  I mean, they worked through the night, because we were here late at night, that first feed that we did,
[01:11:26.412 --> 01:11:32.316]  And most of these barricades were put up after we left, and we probably didn't leave until about 9 p.m.
[01:11:32.356 --> 01:11:33.077]  here this time.
[01:11:33.917 --> 01:11:40.922]  And so they've got a massive amount of security infrastructure here, as well as a massive amount of police officers.
[01:11:40.982 --> 01:11:41.843]  It's costing them a fortune.
[01:11:42.103 --> 01:11:43.004]  They didn't ask about that.
[01:11:43.804 --> 01:11:52.390]  The lead story, Alex, today was InfoWars criticizing the police for the way they arrested that fellow, whether or not they used excessive force.
[01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:53.831]  That was the lead story this morning.
[01:11:54.474 --> 01:11:56.015]  We came down here early this morning.
[01:11:56.215 --> 01:11:59.817]  Karen was over in the photography area, where she'd been successful getting joggers.
[01:12:00.457 --> 01:12:05.360]  We figured we'd get some people doing morning jogs before breakfast.
[01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:10.383]  And evidently, they'd seen the picture of David Petraeus, so we didn't get any joggers.
[01:12:10.423 --> 01:12:15.025]  What we did get was a journalist from the leading television station here in Denmark.
[01:12:15.765 --> 01:12:19.568]  It's Channel 2, and his name is Christian Ringhansen Holt.
[01:12:20.268 --> 01:12:22.169]  Journalist and political correspondent.
[01:12:22.859 --> 01:12:26.586]  And what he wanted to do was to talk to us and to essentially defend the police.
[01:12:26.626 --> 01:12:30.052]  He thought we had over-criticized the actions that took place.
[01:12:31.294 --> 01:12:31.855]  Ignoring...
[01:12:32.626 --> 01:12:45.821]  What happened to Josh, Karen brought that up, you know, the fact that he was accosted by the police, they wanted all of his identity papers, please, because he was merely carrying a camera through the hotel lobby that we were staying in.
[01:12:45.881 --> 01:12:47.083]  He wasn't taking any pictures.
[01:12:47.623 --> 01:12:50.967]  Somebody reported him as a suspicious person, so they tracked him down.
[01:12:51.248 --> 01:12:53.270]  That happened before any of the reports went up.
[01:12:53.894 --> 01:12:56.415]  But evidently, this was the number one news story.
[01:12:56.495 --> 01:12:59.216]  We've seen this happen before when they went to Bilderberg in England.
[01:12:59.516 --> 01:13:05.639]  What they did was they singled out the protester that was the craziest arrest, and they made it about that.
[01:13:06.059 --> 01:13:13.822]  So, there weren't that many protesters this year, so what they did was they made it a story about us covering the arrest and what we feel is excessive force.
[01:13:14.597 --> 01:13:17.939]  We've uploaded a report, or at least it was uploading before we came over here.
[01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:24.503]  My response to it, I basically addressed the Danish people and said, you need to have a discussion as to what excessive force is.
[01:13:24.843 --> 01:13:31.407]  We really haven't had that discussion sufficiently in America yet, but the same people who are meeting over here are going to be selling
[01:13:32.222 --> 01:13:41.707]  Military industrial complex type weapons are going to be selling the police surveillance state equipment to the Danish police as well as they do to the American police.
[01:13:41.727 --> 01:13:43.248]  They're going to be selling that worldwide.
[01:13:43.448 --> 01:13:48.490]  If you just joined us, David Knight is reporting live from Copenhagen, Denmark, side of Bilderberg, 2014.
[01:13:48.991 --> 01:13:55.334]  The event is now in full swing and the unprecedented issue is
[01:13:56.855 --> 01:14:11.966]  For me, the fact that we had a Bilderberg Group member, the head of the Dutch Parliament, which is a prime mover in Europe, and of course the Dutch founded Bilderberg, Prince Bernhard, literally coming over
[01:14:13.595 --> 01:14:17.057]  To talk to the press for 20 minutes and answering a lot of our questions.
[01:14:17.097 --> 01:14:21.160]  And you notice I brought up one of Esalen's internal points that is sourced.
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:23.821]  They're going to be discussing the NSA and the spy grid.
[01:14:24.922 --> 01:14:27.523]  Notice that he said, oh yes, that meeting is coming up now.
[01:14:28.284 --> 01:14:33.607]  So the truth is they've got all these governments and industry heads in there to agree with each other to set policy.
[01:14:34.047 --> 01:14:38.010]  Bilderberg has bragged about that just a week and a half ago in the German paper.
[01:14:38.650 --> 01:14:39.812]  By name, one of the members.
[01:14:40.453 --> 01:14:50.727]  So we have Ed Balls, because he's violating, as the Deputy Prime Minister of England, the shadow Prime Minister as they call him, he's violating their law.
[01:14:51.187 --> 01:14:52.909]  Our politicians are violating the Logan Act.
[01:14:53.250 --> 01:14:54.972]  Hillary got fined for this back in 96.
[01:14:57.533 --> 01:14:58.675]  They need to get in trouble.
[01:14:59.056 --> 01:15:00.518]  This information needs to come out.
[01:15:00.858 --> 01:15:02.541]  And look how far we've come, David Knight.
[01:15:03.042 --> 01:15:07.728]  From no coverage of Bilderberg a decade ago in mainstream media, to now it's all over U.S.
[01:15:07.768 --> 01:15:08.109]  news.
[01:15:08.389 --> 01:15:09.551]  It's a major issue.
[01:15:09.571 --> 01:15:11.794]  DrudgeReport.com, help break that Berlin Wall.
[01:15:12.635 --> 01:15:14.998]  Covering our stuff the last six years, carrying our Bilderberg coverage.
[01:15:15.318 --> 01:15:15.838]  The U.S.
[01:15:15.878 --> 01:15:17.720]  was the last place to ever report on this.
[01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:25.607]  They would make fun of it and go, Alex Jones and other nuts believe there's something called a Bilderberg Group with elites meeting to take over!
[01:15:25.627 --> 01:15:27.970]  No, no, they already took over most of the world.
[01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:31.272]  Now they're trying to put smart meters in my house and gouge me.
[01:15:31.532 --> 01:15:33.513]  Now they want my car to drive itself and tax me.
[01:15:33.933 --> 01:15:35.594]  Now they say my kids belong to them.
[01:15:35.874 --> 01:15:37.095]  Now they want the pension funds.
[01:15:37.335 --> 01:15:39.076]  Now they want to take the veterans' pensions.
[01:15:39.997 --> 01:15:42.959]  And again, it's not like it's even mismanagement they want to take them.
[01:15:43.639 --> 01:15:47.522]  They openly want to take them to make people poor under Agenda 21.
[01:15:47.982 --> 01:15:49.563]  And Bilderberg doesn't run it all.
[01:15:49.723 --> 01:15:54.566]  It's one of their key meeting conferences where they are at.
[01:15:55.703 --> 01:16:02.327]  And then they go, and the same people that run Bilderberg run Trilateral, and they run the other major groups in other countries, like the Royal Institute of International Affairs.
[01:16:02.947 --> 01:16:20.138]  Everyone in Bilderberg, all the major members, the steadfast members, not the guests that come, the 20 or 30 each year, but the 115 or so long-time members, all of them, head up and chair other governmental and non-governmental organizations and corporate groups on record, and then line their pockets with trillions.
[01:16:20.678 --> 01:16:21.859]  They've been caught over and over again.
[01:16:21.879 --> 01:16:24.941]  We listed the Lockheed, Defense Department scams, all of it.
[01:16:25.905 --> 01:16:29.706]  And people keep asking, are they setting policy?
[01:16:30.006 --> 01:16:31.647]  Does it violate this and that law?
[01:16:31.947 --> 01:16:33.247]  Yes, of course it does!
[01:16:33.267 --> 01:16:40.290]  You know, did General Shinseki know they were falsifying reports nationwide that troops had gotten treatment they hadn't?
[01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:43.171]  Yes, that's a top-down order like Fast and Furious.
[01:16:44.142 --> 01:16:45.944]  So, that's the issue.
[01:16:46.505 --> 01:16:48.648]  You're not covering it up anymore.
[01:16:48.968 --> 01:16:59.942]  We're going to point at the illegitimate corporate fascist government, that in the words of Congressman Larry McDonald, is super capitalist, merging with communism, controlled by very few.
[01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:02.721]  China is their model.
[01:17:03.042 --> 01:17:11.789]  China is their dream world, where everybody's a slave except one-tenth of one-tenth of a percent who are billionaires and live in armored compounds and eat organic food.
[01:17:12.250 --> 01:17:16.033]  How is it that billionaire Chinese generals run a communist country?
[01:17:16.474 --> 01:17:17.154]  Because it's not.
[01:17:17.354 --> 01:17:18.676]  It's Bilderberg government.
[01:17:19.642 --> 01:17:21.744]  That's what it is, and I don't want to live under it.
[01:17:22.044 --> 01:17:25.426]  These are the people that run our politicians that want our guns.
[01:17:25.727 --> 01:17:26.267]  David Knight.
[01:17:27.048 --> 01:17:27.948]  That's the issue.
[01:17:28.148 --> 01:17:29.990]  And this is a huge victory.
[01:17:30.310 --> 01:17:33.693]  I wouldn't let them get you off balance diverting off into police and stuff.
[01:17:34.453 --> 01:17:36.054]  Go ahead.
[01:17:36.214 --> 01:17:36.715]  No, no, no.
[01:17:36.735 --> 01:17:39.637]  That's what I was... the point I was making... No, I know you were.
[01:17:39.657 --> 01:17:40.257]  You were saying that.
[01:17:40.277 --> 01:17:40.658]  I understand.
[01:17:41.238 --> 01:17:47.984]  Well, what they're doing is the media, of course, is not covering the substance of Bilderberg or asking any questions about the expense of Bilderberg.
[01:17:48.064 --> 01:17:51.066]  Instead, what they do is they focus on us because we're the only media here.
[01:17:51.367 --> 01:17:55.430]  There's not that many protesters, so instead of focusing on a crazy protester, they talk about that.
[01:17:55.730 --> 01:18:03.517]  But the thing with Ed Balls, now he's the shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, but the actual Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, is here.
[01:18:04.197 --> 01:18:07.359]  And that's essentially equivalent to the Treasury Secretary in the U.S.
[01:18:07.399 --> 01:18:10.361]  So this is a person who the bankers want to interface with.
[01:18:10.421 --> 01:18:11.642]  This is the financial person.
[01:18:12.102 --> 01:18:14.844]  And it's all about what the bankers are doing with everyone.
[01:18:15.144 --> 01:18:18.966]  And as we saw, the tremendous amount of paperwork that he had there.
[01:18:19.387 --> 01:18:26.251]  Again, Martha Stewart was made a poster child for insider trading, and yet our own congressman
[01:18:26.631 --> 01:18:30.452]  Are trading as insider trading, and yet nothing happens with that.
[01:18:30.492 --> 01:18:36.133]  When people noticed it, made a stink about it, they put a law out, and before the law took effect, they eviscerated that law.
[01:18:36.633 --> 01:18:38.793]  So they still are doing insider trading.
[01:18:39.133 --> 01:18:40.294]  Nobody's paying attention to it.
[01:18:40.314 --> 01:18:42.794]  They thought it was a scandal that was a blip on the radar.
[01:18:42.834 --> 01:18:45.015]  They passed some legislation that really wasn't effective.
[01:18:45.275 --> 01:18:48.755]  They then took even that away, and everybody thinks, well, it's done.
[01:18:48.815 --> 01:18:49.215]  It's finished.
[01:18:49.676 --> 01:18:51.796]  This is what we're talking about with insider trading.
[01:18:52.236 --> 01:19:01.640]  This is where the politicians are meeting in secret with these people and whether or not this fellow that came out and was transparent enough to talk to us and candid to talk to us
[01:19:02.705 --> 01:19:07.829]  Whether or not he's been involved in that, whether or not, they're not, I'm sure they're not doing that in the discussion group.
[01:19:07.869 --> 01:19:10.190]  No, he's a rising star, now runs their parliament.
[01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:14.113]  Of course he's the type they're going to bring in because he could end up being the main leader of the country.
[01:19:14.153 --> 01:19:23.720]  Now let's expand on this though, David, because when we come back I want to break down more of what we're learning about their secret agenda from Estill and we've also been able to confirm we have an article coming out on that today.
[01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:29.845]  But you guys have done an incredible job, and everybody else in the media, the real media, has.
[01:19:29.905 --> 01:19:35.350]  Because, look, Bilderberg members never come over and talk to people, especially during the conference.
[01:19:35.631 --> 01:19:40.215]  This is a big deal, and it shows that they know ignoring us isn't working anymore.
[01:19:41.204 --> 01:19:41.644]  No, it's not.
[01:19:42.065 --> 01:19:43.666]  No, they've tried to do more transparency.
[01:19:43.706 --> 01:19:51.450]  Last year, I think they released, maybe it was, you can correct me if I'm wrong, I think it was the first time they had released an official list of attendees.
[01:19:51.511 --> 01:19:52.571]  It was done after the event.
[01:19:53.111 --> 01:19:55.893]  This year, they did an official list of attendees before the event.
[01:19:56.133 --> 01:19:58.875]  They acknowledged that they were having it before the event here.
[01:19:59.295 --> 01:20:01.557]  So, they have tried to be a little...
[01:20:02.117 --> 01:20:02.877]  That's right, that's right.
[01:20:02.897 --> 01:20:03.558]  His Skype cut out.
[01:20:03.858 --> 01:20:05.498]  We're back with David Knight and Paul Watson's coming up.
[01:20:05.518 --> 01:20:06.979]  We've got a bunch of clips we haven't played yet.

[01:23:52.716 --> 01:23:52.756]  800-513-0029.
[01:23:52.776 --> 01:23:53.156]  VaticanCatholic.com.
[01:24:07.414 --> 01:24:08.940]  We don't need no...
[01:24:16.816 --> 01:24:43.671]  I tend to get pretty wound up when I'm watching my reporters, my great reporters, our great reporters, your reporters, we're all part of the info war, if we're against the globalists, out there in the streets and Bilderberg guys are popping up and the police are popping up and I'm like a dog running around a butcher shop not knowing which filet mignon or chateaubriand or you know cutlet I want because there's just so much going on.
[01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:46.620]  It's such a target-rich environment.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:53.302]  And just as David said, they're trying to distract off into me going, look at that!
[01:24:53.482 --> 01:24:56.863]  The police drag a guy behind the fence.
[01:24:57.443 --> 01:24:59.044]  Clearly you're stomping on him and hitting him.
[01:24:59.864 --> 01:25:01.504]  And then they chase another reporter away.
[01:25:01.524 --> 01:25:04.245]  We need to know where that guy went.
[01:25:05.065 --> 01:25:12.327]  Now it turns out that guy was yelling and screaming at people and stirring stuff up and getting in our face and saying horrible things about me, which makes it kind of
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:25.410]  Comical in a way that the cops came over to grab somebody and take him and it looks like beat him up because they were messing with our reporters, but still Maybe he resisted him or something behind the thing.
[01:25:25.450 --> 01:25:40.582]  It's just it doesn't look good to have the cops I don't want to be drugged behind a curtain and then and you see through a six-inch gap them stomping and hitting him And and even if somebody's yelling and screaming and getting in my face The cops would tell him back off don't get in a fight and then we do it again arrest him
[01:25:41.909 --> 01:25:43.650]  And I guess if he resists, I guess beat him up.
[01:25:45.711 --> 01:25:47.692]  So if we're wrong, we apologize to the police.
[01:25:48.092 --> 01:25:55.975]  We'd already said that the police overall were being pretty good other than messing with our reporters a few times and wanting their IDs and stuff.
[01:25:56.576 --> 01:26:00.017]  But compared to a lot of police around the world, I mean, they're pretty good.
[01:26:00.417 --> 01:26:03.199]  And then I saw that scene, and all I was seeing was that scene.
[01:26:03.219 --> 01:26:04.059]  It looked pretty bad to me.
[01:26:04.499 --> 01:26:06.060]  And later I said, well, maybe it's not that bad.
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:09.962]  But not because the guy was messing with us and the police did this.
[01:26:11.730 --> 01:26:14.891]  But because I learned that some said he might have been resisting.
[01:26:15.571 --> 01:26:18.811]  Still doesn't look good to me when they chase the other reporter away that's trying to get footage.
[01:26:19.472 --> 01:26:20.992]  I think that's where the police go into the wrong.
[01:26:21.312 --> 01:26:22.292]  Does it mean they're monsters?
[01:26:22.372 --> 01:26:23.132]  No, I don't think so.
[01:26:23.392 --> 01:26:23.672]  Okay?
[01:26:24.753 --> 01:26:27.633]  Somebody's yelling and screaming at you and shoving on you, you want to punch them in the face.
[01:26:27.733 --> 01:26:28.073]  I get it.
[01:26:28.473 --> 01:26:36.375]  The point is, is that, is that the police need to be at a higher standard, ladies and gentlemen, or we turn into North Korea.
[01:26:37.577 --> 01:26:40.098]  Okay, now I'm saying let's not get distracted by that.
[01:26:40.118 --> 01:26:41.159]  Now we're spending all day on it.
[01:26:41.539 --> 01:26:47.062]  The point is, is that the media, the story is they are trying to change the subject to that.
[01:26:47.342 --> 01:26:48.222]  Because what can they do?
[01:26:48.322 --> 01:26:49.003]  We've defeated them.
[01:26:49.423 --> 01:26:50.443]  Here's the Bilderberg Group.
[01:26:50.463 --> 01:26:51.644]  We're going to continue to expose it.
[01:26:51.984 --> 01:26:57.487]  Now it's going to look at all the other influence peddling, all the other secret meetings, and all the other stuff that's going on.
[01:26:57.507 --> 01:26:58.387]  I mean, we've got Ed Balls.
[01:26:58.407 --> 01:27:00.188]  We'll show the video if you're a TV viewer.
[01:27:00.448 --> 01:27:02.949]  You go to Infowars.com forward slash show, see the free feed.
[01:27:03.770 --> 01:27:06.111]  You see a big all-seeing-eye pyramid on the site?
[01:27:08.222 --> 01:27:10.024]  And people are like, what is this, Illuminati?
[01:27:10.124 --> 01:27:10.745]  Oh my god.
[01:27:10.865 --> 01:27:12.868]  Yes, folks, we're programming you for the Illuminati.
[01:27:12.929 --> 01:27:13.049]  No.
[01:27:14.170 --> 01:27:15.532]  It's only a minority of folks saying that.
[01:27:15.833 --> 01:27:16.834]  It's the Bilderberg coverage.
[01:27:18.001 --> 01:27:22.464]  It's like Drudge has a pyramid on there, symbolizing the elite at the top for the Bilderberg coverage.
[01:27:23.345 --> 01:27:24.686]  We have it as the Bilderberg coverage.
[01:27:24.706 --> 01:27:27.268]  It's just an icon associated with the New World Order.
[01:27:27.288 --> 01:27:30.891]  It says New World Order on the dollar bill under the all-seeing eye.
[01:27:31.191 --> 01:27:34.493]  You go there, that's the Bilderberg coverage page where we bulled out a lot of it.
[01:27:34.694 --> 01:27:36.635]  There's also breaking news on the front page.
[01:27:36.875 --> 01:27:41.939]  We've got two big reports coming out later today with the secret agenda we've gotten that we've confirmed.
[01:27:41.979 --> 01:27:42.519]  This is big.
[01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:44.621]  And on the
[01:27:47.611 --> 01:27:49.793]  Fact that they're definitely setting policy inside of there.
[01:27:50.033 --> 01:27:55.459]  David, other points and other reports you're about to file, other things that you've seen unfold since we talked yesterday.
[01:27:57.685 --> 01:28:04.712]  Well Alex, just briefly touching on that, my point was that the guy who came down here and talked to us was a political consultant.
[01:28:04.772 --> 01:28:09.998]  And so I would expect that he would be covering Bilderberg, but instead he tried to make the story about us.
[01:28:10.058 --> 01:28:11.319]  That was the point I was trying to make.
[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:14.903]  As well as the fact that I do have a report where I address what happened.
[01:28:15.023 --> 01:28:17.586]  I saw some additional footage of the arrest over here.
[01:28:18.306 --> 01:28:20.709]  There were some elements there that I have seen in the U.S.
[01:28:20.789 --> 01:28:27.395]  once the person is on the ground, subdued, you know, the cops basically standing on them with a knee in the back, that type of thing.
[01:28:27.976 --> 01:28:30.959]  You know, I just have zero tolerance for that kind of abuse.
[01:28:31.439 --> 01:28:34.102]  And as you said, the police need to be held to a higher standard.
[01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:36.905]  I understand when they get physical with somebody, they start to get into that.
[01:28:37.445 --> 01:28:45.931]  But what's happening here, of course they're periodically coming out here on the terrace, and that's where we've been able to get some pictures of conference attendees.
[01:28:46.271 --> 01:28:55.277]  We actually got a picture of Eric Schmidt eating earlier, and so we know that he has not made the singularity jump yet to a robotic body.
[01:28:55.657 --> 01:28:57.198]  But that's an important thing to know.
[01:28:57.458 --> 01:28:58.379]  It's not there yet.
[01:28:58.719 --> 01:29:02.462]  You know, they're still sticking to their 2025 schedule, I guess.
[01:29:02.982 --> 01:29:04.143]  And we also saw him on the phone.
[01:29:05.225 --> 01:29:17.327]  Presumably an android, but they're coming out and it's such tight quarters because I think they did put some limitations on them, you know, in a town like this that's crowded even though this area is kind of sparsely populated.
[01:29:17.647 --> 01:29:31.890]  It is a seaside area and they were meeting on a day, yesterday was a national holiday here in Denmark, so I think that wound up having these barricades fairly close and so as they walk out on these terraces, it's the only place that they can go to get outside the hotel.
[01:29:32.430 --> 01:29:33.391]  We can photograph them.
[01:29:33.451 --> 01:29:35.694]  As they come out and go jogging, we can photograph them.
[01:29:35.734 --> 01:29:38.798]  That's why we've been able to get the kind of pictorial coverage that we have.
[01:29:38.838 --> 01:29:40.860]  But that's pretty unprecedented for somebody to come up with that.
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:44.545]  Well, David, I've got to say, this is one of the most successful years for Bilderberg coverage ever.
[01:29:44.945 --> 01:29:46.247]  Is Watson there with you right now?
[01:29:47.389 --> 01:29:47.869]  Yes, he is.
[01:29:48.270 --> 01:29:48.430]  Good.
[01:29:48.450 --> 01:29:55.135]  I want to come back and finish up with you, David, and then I want to talk to Paul and get all the developments he's been saying.
[01:29:55.175 --> 01:29:56.195]  Oh, he's been working on some other stories.
[01:29:56.215 --> 01:29:56.856]  We're on the march.
[01:29:56.876 --> 01:29:57.536]  This is big, folks.
[01:29:57.556 --> 01:29:59.097]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:00.018 --> 01:30:01.459]  Alex Jones and the GZO Radio Network.
[01:30:01.479 --> 01:30:02.740]  And by pointing out it's big, it's the end of them.
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:04.401]  You see, they don't want you to know they exist.
[01:30:04.421 --> 01:30:05.542]  They want to hide.
[01:30:07.031 --> 01:30:11.034]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:30:11.054 --> 01:30:15.196]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:30:15.456 --> 01:30:18.838]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:30:19.099 --> 01:30:21.980]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:30:22.140 --> 01:30:29.465]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:30:29.705 --> 01:30:33.367]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:30:33.607 --> 01:30:37.849]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:30:38.029 --> 01:30:43.971]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:30:44.011 --> 01:30:47.793]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:30:47.953 --> 01:30:50.494]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:30:50.674 --> 01:30:52.035]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:30:52.175 --> 01:30:53.415]  It's time to take action.
[01:30:53.555 --> 01:30:55.216]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:31:07.010 --> 01:31:14.038]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:31:14.158 --> 01:31:16.319]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:31:16.519 --> 01:31:21.603]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:31:21.803 --> 01:31:26.826]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:31:26.966 --> 01:31:30.008]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:31:30.288 --> 01:31:34.150]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:31:34.351 --> 01:31:38.613]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:31:38.673 --> 01:31:48.679]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:31:48.899 --> 01:31:51.441]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:31:51.621 --> 01:31:59.667]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:31:59.827 --> 01:32:03.789]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:32:07.728 --> 01:32:09.489]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[01:32:10.010 --> 01:32:16.974]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[01:32:17.455 --> 01:32:27.881]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[01:32:28.282 --> 01:32:37.508]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[01:32:38.228 --> 01:32:41.671]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[01:32:42.292 --> 01:32:45.715]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[01:32:46.075 --> 01:32:47.636]  Experience the new formula.
[01:32:48.137 --> 01:32:50.098]  Experience the ancient purity.
[01:32:50.699 --> 01:32:51.639]  Shield your family.
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:53.421]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:32:53.861 --> 01:32:56.443]  Available now at Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:57.024 --> 01:33:00.987]  X2 from Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:33:21.838 --> 01:33:25.786]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:26.828 --> 01:33:31.538]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:40.464 --> 01:33:49.426]  You know, I don't engage in Monty Python style humor or gutter humor, but we had a big double entendre earlier talking about Ed Balls.
[01:33:50.506 --> 01:33:54.047]  I'll say, get the clips ready, get the Obama clips ready, get the Bush clips ready.
[01:33:54.767 --> 01:33:58.148]  I go, get both of the clips of Ed ready.
[01:33:59.088 --> 01:34:02.069]  It was a big joke in there, in the studio.
[01:34:02.669 --> 01:34:06.870]  But while we're trying to get Paul Watson and David Knight's Skype reconnected,
[01:34:08.524 --> 01:34:09.525]  It's almost like it's being jammed.
[01:34:09.565 --> 01:34:10.266]  It just won't connect.
[01:34:10.286 --> 01:34:11.827]  It's either totally clear or it won't connect.
[01:34:12.548 --> 01:34:16.952]  While we're trying to line that up to Copenhagen, if not, just go to phone in about five minutes.
[01:34:17.012 --> 01:34:17.853]  Default to phone.
[01:34:17.893 --> 01:34:19.134]  Let them know that if it's not working.
[01:34:22.273 --> 01:34:32.737]  He is the shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, and there, since it's parliamentary power sharing, you can have multiple, you know, basically members that are over it.
[01:34:33.037 --> 01:34:41.601]  But he's also, when I was there in England, they were calling him the shadow Prime Minister because he does a lot of work in his party with David Cameron, the Prime Minister.
[01:34:42.101 --> 01:34:48.564]  But the point is, he's coming in with big, giant files, and the police are wanting to see his ID.
[01:34:51.599 --> 01:34:54.402]  And he does look like a really sneaky, crazy person in person.
[01:34:55.143 --> 01:34:56.825]  I mean, he looks okay on TV.
[01:34:56.845 --> 01:35:01.631]  When I saw him in person at the BBC studio, when I went in to be on TV next, he was coming off.
[01:35:01.651 --> 01:35:02.812]  We have that clip coming up in a moment.
[01:35:03.933 --> 01:35:08.799]  He, uh, you know, did look like, he didn't look as distinguished as some of the other globalists.
[01:35:10.182 --> 01:35:21.832]  I think that's why the police didn't believe anything he was saying and made him show a whole bunch of forms of ID and make phone calls with his assistant on top of everything else, which I'm sure is an elitist he didn't like happening.
[01:35:22.813 --> 01:35:27.377]  But that footage of those files, he needs to say what was in those files.
[01:35:29.741 --> 01:35:38.187]  Because you notice the Guardian reporter was talking to him earlier, talking to Bilderberg, a group member that came over and was talking to our people through the fence, unprecedented, as they realized their cover's blown.
[01:35:38.987 --> 01:35:54.318]  The leader of the major labor party and the leader of the parliament in the Netherlands, in the Dutch Federation, she was bringing up, you're setting policy in there, and he said,
[01:35:56.283 --> 01:35:58.405]  Yes, we are setting policy.
[01:35:58.445 --> 01:35:59.946]  We are discussing policy in there.
[01:36:01.267 --> 01:36:05.091]  And that's illegal in most countries, so they've always said, oh no, no.
[01:36:05.571 --> 01:36:09.675]  All these billionaires and royalty and people meet in secret and do all this.
[01:36:09.695 --> 01:36:17.001]  Because we're discussing our golf swing and we play golf on Sunday afternoon after the three-day conference is over and we leave on Monday.
[01:36:17.882 --> 01:36:20.744]  You know, nothing's going on at the event.
[01:36:21.425 --> 01:36:22.386]  So let's go to the clip.
[01:36:22.626 --> 01:36:23.326]  Here I am.
[01:36:24.632 --> 01:36:27.274]  Uh, asking balls about what they're doing at Bilderberg.
[01:36:27.314 --> 01:36:29.455]  And then we've got Watson when he leaves out in the hallway.
[01:36:29.876 --> 01:36:30.896]  Watson gets him again.
[01:36:30.996 --> 01:36:33.838]  So, here is that clip from last year in London.
[01:36:34.078 --> 01:36:34.879]  Can I shake your hand?
[01:36:35.579 --> 01:36:36.680]  Mr. Balls, can I shake your hand?
[01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:38.461]  Hey, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:36:38.521 --> 01:36:39.702]  I kind of led the demonstrations.
[01:36:39.842 --> 01:36:40.522]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:36:40.842 --> 01:36:41.323]  Good to see you.
[01:36:42.563 --> 01:36:45.805]  Why can't you guys talk about Build-A-Burger?
[01:36:46.725 --> 01:36:52.148]  The rules of these things are all decided by people that have been here for a long time.
[01:36:52.448 --> 01:36:53.929]  I mean, it is a corporate world government.
[01:36:54.149 --> 01:36:56.590]  I need to get you to sit down if that's alright, thank you.
[01:36:56.610 --> 01:36:57.931]  There you go, talk about the Build-A-Burger.
[01:36:58.091 --> 01:36:59.111]  It doesn't exist.
[01:37:01.192 --> 01:37:03.233]  Do we have a sting going into this or not?
[01:37:03.333 --> 01:37:04.113]  There goes the Bilderberg.
[01:37:04.133 --> 01:37:04.673]  Alright, there I am.
[01:37:04.713 --> 01:37:05.953]  Now let's go to the next video clip.
[01:37:05.993 --> 01:37:08.054]  As Bowles walks out, we get him twice, Watson hits him.
[01:37:08.194 --> 01:37:08.394]  I mean...
[01:37:22.933 --> 01:37:23.273]  Hi, Ed.
[01:37:23.793 --> 01:37:24.254]  I'm Paul.
[01:37:24.274 --> 01:37:24.874]  Nice to meet you.
[01:37:24.894 --> 01:37:25.694]  Hi there, how are you?
[01:37:25.774 --> 01:37:27.315]  What did you talk about at Bilderberg then?
[01:37:27.455 --> 01:37:29.016]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on.
[01:37:29.036 --> 01:37:30.556]  Breaking your ministerial code.
[01:37:32.417 --> 01:37:33.638]  Give us a word, Ed, please.
[01:37:33.678 --> 01:37:34.718]  Breaking the ministerial code?
[01:37:34.798 --> 01:37:35.018]  Yeah.
[01:37:35.419 --> 01:37:37.820]  I'm not a... Meeting with secret private meetings.
[01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:38.580]  I'm not a minister.
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:41.861]  Yeah, but you meet, you're conspiring with private individuals.
[01:37:41.921 --> 01:37:45.943]  I'm gonna do a freedom of information act request.
[01:37:47.944 --> 01:37:48.844]  Who did you meet with then?
[01:37:49.405 --> 01:37:49.965]  Eric Schmidt?
[01:37:51.661 --> 01:37:52.141]  Don't be silly.
[01:37:52.301 --> 01:37:53.561]  What do you think of Alex Jones?
[01:37:55.342 --> 01:37:56.462]  Don't be silly.
[01:37:57.822 --> 01:38:05.744]  So again, the last thing they want is their private secret meetings becoming an event, a paparazzi.
[01:38:05.844 --> 01:38:12.525]  Because see, then people won't care about whatever her name is, baby, Kim Kardashian's baby.
[01:38:13.105 --> 01:38:17.106]  They will start caring again, like we did a hundred years ago about the robber barons.
[01:38:17.870 --> 01:38:18.871]  And what are they up to?
[01:38:18.912 --> 01:38:20.253]  And how are they trying to get tax money?
[01:38:20.654 --> 01:38:22.476]  There's high def video that our crew got.
[01:38:22.897 --> 01:38:26.862]  David Knight, Josh Owens, Paul Watson, Karen Knight.
[01:38:26.882 --> 01:38:30.347]  Just an incredible job and crew out there.
[01:38:31.068 --> 01:38:33.952]  I tell you, we should be absolutely ecstatic.
[01:38:33.972 --> 01:38:35.173]  I don't say this most years.
[01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:38.593]  I said it last year and the year before because it's getting better and better.
[01:38:38.613 --> 01:38:40.655]  David, do you think I'm being too optimistic?
[01:38:41.595 --> 01:38:43.137]  Or is this really a big victory?
[01:38:43.718 --> 01:38:46.040]  That a Bilderberg group came over and talked to you, remember?
[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:50.885]  That we're getting all this high-def footage, that it's all over the news, that a lot of even U.S.
[01:38:50.925 --> 01:38:53.767]  publications are saying, yeah, this looks pretty serious.
[01:38:54.128 --> 01:38:55.189]  Why isn't this being covered?
[01:38:55.409 --> 01:39:00.354]  I mean, they're going now from ignoring it to laughing at us and admitting it's real, to not laughing at us.
[01:39:00.834 --> 01:39:04.837]  Only a few publications called us people that believe in space aliens and lizards.
[01:39:04.877 --> 01:39:06.238]  I think the Evening Standard did that.
[01:39:06.899 --> 01:39:11.563]  Now, sure, the Dutch media is trying to distract off into, are we reporting on the police accurate?
[01:39:11.743 --> 01:39:12.523]  That doesn't matter.
[01:39:12.744 --> 01:39:16.046]  The elephant in the room, as you're saying, is this global governance meeting.
[01:39:17.888 --> 01:39:18.528]  That's right, Alex.
[01:39:18.628 --> 01:39:20.950]  And, you know, I'm glad that he came out and talked to us.
[01:39:21.010 --> 01:39:22.451]  And, of course, he's a politician.
[01:39:22.471 --> 01:39:24.653]  He's a leader of a major party, perhaps.
[01:39:25.425 --> 01:39:36.434]  So the majority party in Holland, I'm not sure what they are, Netherlands, I'm not sure what the politics are there, but the interesting thing to me is that the mayor of Atlanta is here.
[01:39:36.534 --> 01:39:40.718]  Now, you know, I understand why the leader of the Labour Party in the Netherlands is here.
[01:39:40.818 --> 01:39:42.859]  I don't understand why the mayor of Atlanta is here.
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:44.241]  What is he an expert on?
[01:39:44.921 --> 01:39:47.062]  Well, he's major presidential material.
[01:39:47.102 --> 01:39:50.182]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:39:50.803 --> 01:40:10.788]  Also, only Atlanta and Austin and one other city, I forget which one, I was reading like a Wall Street Journal article a few months ago, halfway, and it was describing that Austin, Atlanta, and only one other city are known as mega-growth cities where a lot of money is being made in real estate, you name it, and the elite
[01:40:11.448 --> 01:40:16.070]  Like investments, just like the year before they did the pump and dump with Facebook.
[01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:21.853]  They had Zuckerberg there, and then he's not been there the other years, you know, to decide how they all got into the $100 billion scam.
[01:40:23.567 --> 01:40:24.908]  Which was an admitted pump and dump.
[01:40:25.329 --> 01:40:27.410]  So it's the same thing over and over again.
[01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:29.332]  I mean, they're probably running Bitcoin.
[01:40:29.592 --> 01:40:35.678]  You know, the point is they're in there as businessmen running, getting all the inside intel and deciding things.
[01:40:35.718 --> 01:40:43.425]  That's why I think they've got the mayor there because he's an up-and-comer and they want to get preferential treatment with their projects in Atlanta.
[01:40:43.445 --> 01:40:43.665]  Go ahead.
[01:40:44.690 --> 01:40:45.350]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:40:45.370 --> 01:40:50.174]  I hope, as he's a politician, maybe he would want to have the transparency to come out here and talk to us.
[01:40:50.234 --> 01:40:53.796]  And we could ask him, is he auditioning to be a puppet president?
[01:40:53.976 --> 01:41:00.461]  Or is it that he's handing them some sweet deals on real estate that they can pick up in Atlanta, a growth city?
[01:41:00.761 --> 01:41:01.621]  That's a good point, Alex.
[01:41:02.022 --> 01:41:02.562]  Exactly.
[01:41:02.702 --> 01:41:07.085]  And expanding on that, David Knight, again, at Copenhagen, Denmark, covering Bilderberg 2014.
[01:41:08.026 --> 01:41:11.208]  They always do things that cover a bunch of bases, and it just popped in my head.
[01:41:11.668 --> 01:41:14.450]  Atlanta is in the North American Treaty Agreement.
[01:41:15.530 --> 01:41:30.458]  Under spec, the preliminary agreed upon capital of the North American Union, and they're looking at it perhaps being the new main global capital, even above New York or Tokyo or London.
[01:41:30.959 --> 01:41:36.622]  And so I know that as well, that Atlanta they think is very special for a bunch of reasons.
[01:41:37.994 --> 01:41:42.996]  I didn't know that, but yeah, it's even fairly close to the Georgia Guidestones, too, I guess.
[01:41:43.296 --> 01:41:48.737]  They can go there and have an outing and worship their plan to depopulate the world.
[01:41:49.458 --> 01:41:54.379]  Also, they are pretty racist and anti-Africa and destroying Africa and destabilizing it on record.
[01:41:54.879 --> 01:42:00.641]  And Prince Bernard got caught with World Wildlife Fund fronts that he ran, using it as a front to hunt animals.
[01:42:01.321 --> 01:42:26.426]  uh... and and and and sell that you can make hundreds of millions off of sell their tuscan things and for diamond running and money laundering remember he got caught not just in the Lockheed scandal the king of uh... well he was married to the queens who was the prince uh... the german uh... prince uh... who the SS officer she married uh... so I'm sure he got ADL awards I don't know if he did but most Nazis actually get them like like George Soros but that's a side issue
[01:42:28.383 --> 01:42:37.348]  Uh, they probably, again for political correctness now, because they know they're being watched, oh, this guy ended up being president, he's in Atlanta, he's black, let's bring him out.
[01:42:37.788 --> 01:42:38.908]  I think that's part of it too.
[01:42:39.949 --> 01:42:41.049]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[01:42:41.690 --> 01:42:50.474]  Well, I'm interested to talk to some of the people here in Denmark, and actually I was able to find a place where there were a lot of people, because around here it's very sparsely populated.
[01:42:50.514 --> 01:42:56.037]  You saw the first report we did, you ask, is this the Omega Man movie, because the streets were totally deserted.
[01:42:56.717 --> 01:43:07.160]  Uh, but we did find a place where there's a lot of people, like a shopping zone or whatever, tourist zone, so I do want to ask them some questions about their take on the Euro, and as well as the EU.
[01:43:07.220 --> 01:43:12.342]  I know they don't like the Euro, they rejected it, even though they hopped into the European Union at a fairly early date.
[01:43:13.368 --> 01:43:19.634]  And hey, if Karen ever wants your wife's doing photography for us, she's got some of the great photos of some of these globalists, folks will find it.
[01:43:19.934 --> 01:43:23.597]  RealAlexJones on Twitter and InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:43:24.518 --> 01:43:28.642]  We've got some big master coverage articles, again, boiling all this down and coming out later this afternoon.
[01:43:28.662 --> 01:43:36.870]  But if she wants to pop in later or do some YouTube reports, giving her perspective on what she's seen, and we would love to talk to her.
[01:43:37.230 --> 01:43:41.433]  David Knight, we'll get more updates for you tonight on the nightly news and throughout the weekend.
[01:43:41.793 --> 01:43:47.656]  And then obviously next week, you're going to be co-hosting in studio at least three of the five days.
[01:43:47.696 --> 01:43:49.197]  I told him to tell you this a few days ago.
[01:43:49.557 --> 01:43:51.899]  If you're able to do it, then you can take off the next week if you want.
[01:43:51.919 --> 01:43:52.799]  You've been working really hard.
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:58.103]  But if not, I will see you back here sometime the week after that.
[01:43:58.123 --> 01:44:00.804]  My only concern is the flights.
[01:44:00.904 --> 01:44:03.446]  It was such a Keystone Cop thing coming out here.
[01:44:04.102 --> 01:44:11.724]  With the weather cancellations and the other cancellations, missing our flights, having our luggage lost, I mean, it was a pretty amazing trip out here.
[01:44:11.944 --> 01:44:13.424]  Hopefully it'll be more normal when we go back.
[01:44:13.504 --> 01:44:23.966]  It must be nice for the guys enough to go through TSA, all those elitists on their wide-body private jets, with their top-of-the-line hookers a taxpayer paid for in most cases.
[01:44:24.407 --> 01:44:26.287]  Must be fun for them to not have to go through all that.
[01:44:27.495 --> 01:44:31.117]  Yeah, but you know, Alex, remember when we went through that turnstile the other day?
[01:44:31.157 --> 01:44:41.063]  I mean, we were immediately into metal detectors and, you know, put your bags over here to be checked, so maybe they have a walk-around for the attendees and maybe that's just for the hotel staff.
[01:44:41.103 --> 01:44:45.906]  I don't know what that was, but I was surprised to see that at a Bilderberg meeting when we first walked in there.
[01:44:45.966 --> 01:44:46.967]  Unprecedented.
[01:44:47.347 --> 01:44:49.448]  But again, we're blowing the shadow government wide open.
[01:44:49.468 --> 01:44:50.809]  We're going to get Paul Watson on now.
[01:44:50.869 --> 01:44:51.890]  Thank you very much, David Knight.
[01:44:53.021 --> 01:44:53.141]  Right.
[01:44:53.542 --> 01:44:56.206]  And again, folks, so many different angles of this.
[01:44:56.226 --> 01:45:00.853]  He's going to get set up with Paul Watson now, but it's a big deal.
[01:45:01.943 --> 01:45:02.884]  I know I keep saying that.
[01:45:03.104 --> 01:45:04.925]  They don't want us to think of it as a big deal.
[01:45:05.505 --> 01:45:06.666]  That's the main talking point.
[01:45:07.046 --> 01:45:08.848]  There is a corporatist world government.
[01:45:09.108 --> 01:45:16.073]  If you go to the front page of Infowars.com, you'll see one of the great graphics our crew put together, and it says Bilderberg 2014.
[01:45:16.733 --> 01:45:30.923]  The drive of the Rockefellers and their allies is to create a one world government combining super capitalism and communism under the same tent, all under their control, Congressman Larry P. McDonnell.
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:39.064]  Who was a Democrat, who was a Libertarian, who was super good-looking, super smart, super patriot.
[01:45:39.124 --> 01:45:40.384]  They were so scared of him.
[01:45:40.404 --> 01:45:41.685]  He was going to be President, folks.
[01:45:42.445 --> 01:45:48.608]  And they had his plane forced down by the Russians in North Korea, and the word is they tortured the hell out of everybody on that plane.
[01:45:49.168 --> 01:45:54.471]  They stopped the plane in Alaska and got the Speaker of the House and everybody else off.
[01:45:54.491 --> 01:45:55.291]  He's like, what's going on?
[01:45:55.351 --> 01:45:56.292]  You just go on.
[01:45:56.852 --> 01:46:00.054]  You just head on to your mission to Asia.
[01:46:01.094 --> 01:46:04.118]  And they were so... he was the leader of the John Birch Society.
[01:46:04.138 --> 01:46:12.127]  I mean, on every front, Larry P. McDonald, ladies and gentlemen, was beyond Ron Paul.
[01:46:12.587 --> 01:46:14.790]  Because Ron Paul's smart, a statesman, great, but...
[01:46:16.187 --> 01:46:17.327]  Not really a fiery speaker.
[01:46:18.227 --> 01:46:24.869]  And he's a great speaker and a statesman and more of a Gandalfian type guy.
[01:46:26.049 --> 01:46:31.831]  But when you look at the archetype of Larry P. MacDonald, I would have loved to have gotten to meet somebody like that.
[01:46:31.851 --> 01:46:37.812]  I mean, you could just tell he was the real deal, cared about this country, was a hard charger, was calling him out.
[01:46:37.852 --> 01:46:41.893]  You could see a Larry P. MacDonald debate about the CFR on Hardball.
[01:46:43.422 --> 01:46:45.383]  We ought to air that sometime from the 80s.
[01:46:45.524 --> 01:46:50.567]  I mean, it's just amazing how on his feet he was, how well spoken.
[01:46:50.587 --> 01:46:52.309]  And they killed him.
[01:46:53.009 --> 01:46:56.732]  And the word is, the word is they kept him alive quite a while.
[01:46:56.772 --> 01:46:57.693]  They did not like him.
[01:46:57.793 --> 01:46:59.994]  So, he's just a hero.
[01:47:00.034 --> 01:47:00.775]  They got him, folks.
[01:47:00.815 --> 01:47:04.178]  They really tortured the hell out of that guy from the intel I've gotten.
[01:47:05.157 --> 01:47:09.678]  And they wanted to know, because again, he had a plan with a lot of other patriots.
[01:47:10.539 --> 01:47:12.019]  There are patriots in the establishment.
[01:47:12.119 --> 01:47:14.140]  There are people that don't want to turn the world over to pure evil.
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:23.182]  He was known for his staunch opposition to communism and believed in long-standing covert efforts by the Trilateral Commission and other powerful groups to bring about socialism and world government.
[01:47:23.703 --> 01:47:28.464]  He was the second president of the John Birch Society and also a cousin to George S. Patton.
[01:47:31.025 --> 01:47:32.325]  And they also killed Patton.
[01:47:32.385 --> 01:47:34.686]  I've interviewed the guy, the hitman that killed him.
[01:47:36.639 --> 01:47:39.522]  And the author, and it's what the military all said happened.
[01:47:40.082 --> 01:47:48.671]  They shot him with a big, high-powered air gun, with a big slug in it, so it wouldn't even penetrate him, it would just break his neck.
[01:47:50.552 --> 01:47:59.381]  Wrecked the train, parked the car in front of it, shot him, and he still held on as they went and poisoned him to death because he didn't want to build up the Soviet Union.
[01:47:59.441 --> 01:48:00.321]  It just never ends.
[01:48:01.226 --> 01:48:02.487]  Of course the family knew about that.
[01:48:02.767 --> 01:48:04.287]  Let's go to Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:48:04.728 --> 01:48:07.229]  Paul, thank you for joining us from Bilderberg 2014.
[01:48:08.409 --> 01:48:11.051]  What do you take away from what's happening and what you've witnessed?
[01:48:12.231 --> 01:48:13.612]  Hi Alex, good to be back.
[01:48:14.872 --> 01:48:20.295]  The first thing to mention is obviously the footage we got last night, well we uploaded last night, got the article out this morning.
[01:48:20.948 --> 01:48:28.037]  Which was the Shadow Chancellor of Great Britain, Ed Balls, who of course we confronted last year in Watford in England.
[01:48:28.057 --> 01:48:34.285]  He was denied entry to Bilderberg and actually this has generated a lot of media attention.
[01:48:34.485 --> 01:48:36.768]  London Guardian Independent have picked up our video.
[01:48:37.876 --> 01:48:46.662]  He didn't have his credentials, he couldn't get into the meeting, so he was stood there talking to police for several minutes while they tried to check his credentials.
[01:48:47.122 --> 01:48:55.167]  What was interesting to me, of course, is he had this giant bag full of files, thick files, literally, you know, two dozen files.
[01:48:56.008 --> 01:48:56.128]  So,
[01:48:57.023 --> 01:49:00.606]  To say that Bilderberg is a mere talking shop as much of the mainstream media still does.
[01:49:00.687 --> 01:49:05.431]  And it's clearly some type of voting agenda package for the heads of committees.
[01:49:05.831 --> 01:49:13.699]  I'll bet my right arm it's heads of committees voting packages for corporate minutes where they make decisions in a corporate boardroom.
[01:49:13.979 --> 01:49:21.406]  It's an illegal, shadow, criminal, corporate boardroom and they brag out of the other side of their mouth that that is what they do.
[01:49:21.866 --> 01:49:22.266]  Go ahead, Paul.
[01:49:24.818 --> 01:49:27.579]  Well, he's obviously giving some kind of presentation.
[01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:33.642]  And the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, is also there, his so-called opposite in the Conservative Party.
[01:49:34.203 --> 01:49:38.705]  So they're scheming together when they're supposedly on opposite sides of the political fence.
[01:49:39.345 --> 01:49:40.466]  So we got that video up.
[01:49:40.526 --> 01:49:43.087]  It's since been picked up by The Guardian, The Independent and others.
[01:49:44.308 --> 01:49:45.349]  That was a major coup.
[01:49:45.689 --> 01:49:52.335]  Of course, then we were down here in the afternoon when some of the Bilderberg members were coming out after their first conference in the morning.
[01:49:52.715 --> 01:49:59.041]  We got Etienne D'Avignon, we got James Wolfensohn, Google CEO Eric Schmidt.
[01:49:59.581 --> 01:50:00.882]  They didn't stay out for long.
[01:50:00.922 --> 01:50:02.143]  They obviously knew we were here.
[01:50:02.163 --> 01:50:05.867]  They kind of moved away from us when they saw us.
[01:50:05.907 --> 01:50:08.189]  They turned away from us, moved further back up.
[01:50:09.504 --> 01:50:15.668]  Obviously, as you probably know now, there's a huge group of them right outside schmoozing into the evening hours.
[01:50:16.789 --> 01:50:22.893]  Well, I would like to continue into the next hour, then get an update from you guys at the bottom of the hour, if you're still able.
[01:50:23.073 --> 01:50:29.176]  Who got that great HD of Schmidt and all them sitting around with world leaders obviously drinking and making decisions?
[01:50:29.457 --> 01:50:33.259]  Because that is just amazing footage, and I want to get some more of that.
[01:50:33.499 --> 01:50:35.020]  I know we sent some telephoto lenses.
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:37.141]  How are you guys able to get this?
[01:50:37.241 --> 01:50:37.682]  I can see
[01:50:38.922 --> 01:50:41.184]  I can see Wolfdenson over there smoking a cigar.
[01:50:41.204 --> 01:50:44.947]  I mean, that is... Yeah, with Etienne D'Avignon.
[01:50:45.127 --> 01:50:46.108]  Isn't that the head of Fiat?
[01:50:46.308 --> 01:50:49.070]  Isn't that the head of Fiat right there who's getting Jeep?
[01:50:49.090 --> 01:50:51.132]  Putting his jacket on?
[01:50:51.812 --> 01:50:52.373]  Go ahead, sorry.
[01:50:53.994 --> 01:50:56.736]  The guy stood up behind Wolfenson is Etienne D'Avignon.
[01:50:56.776 --> 01:51:03.001]  Of course, he was the guy who bragged in 1999 that this Euro single currency was a brainchild of Bilderberg.
[01:51:03.021 --> 01:51:04.903]  Yeah, yeah, that's the former head of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:51:05.584 --> 01:51:06.805]  Well, we're going to come right back.
[01:51:06.845 --> 01:51:07.205]  Stay there.
[01:51:07.225 --> 01:51:07.585]  Amazing.
[01:51:09.947 --> 01:51:15.410]  I'm Tisha Cassada and I'm running as an independent for Congress in Colorado.
[01:51:15.490 --> 01:51:20.213]  I fight to end the military police state, ban GMO toxic foods, and abolish legal tender laws.

[01:52:06.312 --> 01:52:09.753]  It's been said, those who control the food, control the people.
[01:52:09.973 --> 01:52:13.695]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[01:52:13.775 --> 01:52:19.736]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.

[01:53:06.107 --> 01:53:12.211]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential foreclosure situation?
[01:53:12.231 --> 01:53:15.573]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:53:15.653 --> 01:53:17.214]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[01:53:17.274 --> 01:53:23.558]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:53:23.638 --> 01:53:29.522]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[01:53:29.662 --> 01:53:33.404]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:53:33.584 --> 01:53:36.485]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:53:36.545 --> 01:53:44.649]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:53:44.909 --> 01:53:46.950]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:53:47.010 --> 01:53:48.051]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:53:48.411 --> 01:53:57.119]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[01:54:18.383 --> 01:54:19.744]  Is it getting better?
[01:54:20.484 --> 01:54:21.984]  Or do you feel the same?
[01:54:23.225 --> 01:54:25.006]  Or do you feel the same?
[01:54:25.066 --> 01:54:28.507]  Does it make it easier on you, baby?
[01:54:28.567 --> 01:54:31.008]  Will it make it easier on you now?
[01:54:31.148 --> 01:54:33.029]  You got someone to blame.
[01:54:33.349 --> 01:54:35.049]  You got someone to blame.
[01:54:35.069 --> 01:54:37.650]  Johnny Cash says it's so much better for you two.
[01:54:38.251 --> 01:54:38.971]  One love.
[01:54:40.752 --> 01:54:41.472]  One life.
[01:54:42.812 --> 01:54:44.073]  When it's one need.
[01:54:44.153 --> 01:54:45.513]  In the night.
[01:54:45.874 --> 01:54:46.654]  In the night.
[01:54:50.452 --> 01:54:58.518]  All right, Paul Watson is our guest.
[01:54:59.038 --> 01:55:04.001]  I'm going to have them try to go over the next 20-30 minutes, get more eye-depth footage of them meeting.
[01:55:04.442 --> 01:55:05.823]  That is powerful information.
[01:55:05.843 --> 01:55:08.724]  We're exposing the true shadow controllers.
[01:55:09.025 --> 01:55:16.610]  They want us fighting with each other over religion, sex, region, while they, the globalists, meet and steal literally trillions a year in banker bailouts.
[01:55:17.230 --> 01:55:20.313]  Yeah, there was another incident while we were down here filming.
[01:55:33.391 --> 01:55:45.444]  Over in the protest area, I know a delegate came out earlier on the show to talk to us, but there was a separate delegate, a Dutch politician, who came out of the Bilderberg group meeting and went over to talk to the protesters.
[01:55:46.005 --> 01:55:50.770]  We weren't there, Julia was there, so you should probably get her on after the next segment or whatever.
[01:55:51.497 --> 01:55:54.661]  And it was a kind of olive branch as far as I understand it.
[01:55:54.821 --> 01:55:58.405]  Oh listen, Dietrich Samson is the leader of the Labour Party.
[01:55:58.746 --> 01:56:01.088]  We were able to get in on that, unless it was another Dutch one.
[01:56:01.549 --> 01:56:05.654]  And yeah, they're basically starting to mainline themselves.
[01:56:05.674 --> 01:56:07.756]  Was it somebody other than Dietrich Samson?
[01:56:07.796 --> 01:56:08.738]  That's unprecedented.
[01:56:09.820 --> 01:56:12.861]  It was the same guy, but it was in a different area.
[01:56:12.901 --> 01:56:21.623]  He went out to the protest camp and started speaking to those people, so he's definitely been dispatched for public relations purposes by the sounds of it.
[01:56:24.043 --> 01:56:24.924]  Very interesting.
[01:56:26.324 --> 01:56:27.384]  Again, Paul, I've been interrupting.
[01:56:27.444 --> 01:56:28.424]  Other points that are important?
[01:56:31.087 --> 01:56:35.808]  Well, we've just been going back and forth from here to the hotel, basically uploading the videos, getting the articles out.
[01:56:36.388 --> 01:56:44.690]  Tomorrow's going to be interesting because obviously there are no conferences, no meetings inside the hotel as far as we know it on Saturday, or at least very few.
[01:56:45.190 --> 01:56:49.551]  So they could go on a little walkabout, which might present some options.
[01:56:49.671 --> 01:56:51.392]  So we're looking forward to that.
[01:56:51.872 --> 01:56:53.392]  Tomorrow could be very interesting.
[01:56:55.063 --> 01:56:55.823]  Absolutely.
[01:56:55.963 --> 01:57:02.726]  Tomorrow we've got to hunt them in the First Amendment in free speech, but we will be hunting them to try to get the questions.
[01:57:02.746 --> 01:57:04.287]  We'll probably only get one or two questions.
[01:57:04.707 --> 01:57:09.569]  The best tactic is to say, Hi, Eric Schmidt, or, Oh, are you with the conference?
[01:57:09.969 --> 01:57:11.009]  And get their hand.
[01:57:11.529 --> 01:57:15.571]  Reach out, get their hand, and once you've got their hand, don't let go of it.
[01:57:17.276 --> 01:57:18.897]  That's what I did with Ed Balls last year.
[01:57:18.917 --> 01:57:20.297]  I was like, hey Ed, nice to meet you.
[01:57:20.837 --> 01:57:24.318]  Rather than just going confrontational from the off.
[01:57:24.358 --> 01:57:26.699]  I want to talk to them, I want to hear what they've got to say.
[01:57:27.119 --> 01:57:29.580]  If you go in too aggressive, they'll just immediately back away.
[01:57:30.140 --> 01:57:32.681]  We're not aggressive, we're just trying to get information, trying to talk to them.
[01:57:33.421 --> 01:57:39.742]  But in terms of media coverage, it's gone from a trickle to starting to become a deluge.
[01:57:40.102 --> 01:57:45.223]  A lot of reports, many of which are quite straight and positive, a few of which are just horrible.
[01:57:45.243 --> 01:57:48.864]  I mean, there was a Telegraph article which was just full of errors.
[01:57:49.404 --> 01:57:53.785]  For example, they said that Bilderberg peaked in terms of the protests before 9-11.
[01:57:54.105 --> 01:57:55.985]  Before 9-11, there was nobody at Bilderberg.
[01:57:56.005 --> 01:57:58.506]  There was Jim Tucker and maybe a couple of other journalists.
[01:57:58.526 --> 01:57:58.866]  Yeah, we had like 4,000.
[01:58:00.286 --> 01:58:02.668]  It peaked last year, unless it keeps really growing.
[01:58:03.048 --> 01:58:06.831]  But there's hardly anybody this time, just because it's hard to get there and expensive.
[01:58:08.032 --> 01:58:09.753]  They made a big mistake doing it north of London.
[01:58:09.993 --> 01:58:12.295]  I'd say what, 4,000 max at one time?
[01:58:12.535 --> 01:58:13.616]  I mean, that's unprecedented.
[01:58:15.029 --> 01:58:16.069]  Oh, it was absolutely huge.
[01:58:16.109 --> 01:58:19.151]  I mean, compared to this year, the numbers are minimal.
[01:58:19.171 --> 01:58:20.651]  I guess it's going to be bigger tomorrow.
[01:58:21.151 --> 01:58:23.532]  But, you know, obviously you were a big draw.
[01:58:23.732 --> 01:58:24.572]  Ike was a big draw.
[01:58:25.313 --> 01:58:35.816]  But there was another article in The Week, which is quite a big publication in the UK, and they were very keen to make the point that Osama Bin Laden and Timothy McVeigh also believe that the Bilderberg Group has power.
[01:58:36.136 --> 01:58:40.138]  So it's not the fact that you've got Bilderberg Group members admitting that they've got power.
[01:58:40.578 --> 01:58:42.479]  You know, the big German magazine publication.
[01:58:42.499 --> 01:58:44.240]  No, no, you're a terrorist if you say that.
[01:58:44.260 --> 01:58:45.081]  I want to come back to you.
[01:58:45.101 --> 01:58:45.461]  Stay there.
[01:58:46.242 --> 01:58:48.803]  Okay, maybe we're all evil.
[01:58:48.823 --> 01:58:50.905]  I mean, I don't believe in Santa Claus.
[01:58:50.965 --> 01:58:53.326]  I do believe in, uh, that I built my business.
[01:58:54.127 --> 01:58:54.887]  We'll be right back folks.
[01:58:54.907 --> 01:58:55.548]  Third hour coming up.
[01:58:57.839 --> 01:58:58.900]  In the near future.
[01:58:59.180 --> 01:59:03.323]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:59:03.684 --> 01:59:04.704]  Security alert.
[01:59:04.904 --> 01:59:06.666]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:59:06.906 --> 01:59:07.546]  Analysis.
[01:59:07.787 --> 01:59:08.447]  InfoWars.
[01:59:08.527 --> 01:59:10.469]  Building independent media operations.
[01:59:10.489 --> 01:59:15.472]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:59:15.513 --> 01:59:16.433]  Prime Directive.
[01:59:16.533 --> 01:59:17.974]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:59:18.094 --> 01:59:20.857]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:59:20.937 --> 01:59:24.019]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:59:24.179 --> 01:59:26.361]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:59:26.801 --> 01:59:27.961]  People are assaulting us.
[01:59:27.981 --> 01:59:30.322]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:59:30.842 --> 01:59:32.502]  They are never going to stop.
[01:59:32.763 --> 01:59:36.664]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[01:59:36.824 --> 01:59:39.984]  Block free iPhone ads at InfoWars.com.
[01:59:40.424 --> 01:59:43.065]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[01:59:43.765 --> 01:59:44.505]  Imperative.
[01:59:44.766 --> 01:59:46.726]  Destroy Privileged TV.
[01:59:46.766 --> 01:59:51.187]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:59:51.467 --> 01:59:53.588]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[01:59:59.676 --> 02:00:01.619]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:02.059 --> 02:00:04.863]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:11.584 --> 02:00:12.225]  Big Brother.
[02:00:12.905 --> 02:00:13.926]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:14.667 --> 02:00:15.767]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:16.428 --> 02:00:17.229]  You want answers?
[02:00:18.009 --> 02:00:18.910]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:19.550 --> 02:00:23.213]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:23.754 --> 02:00:27.817]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.933 --> 02:00:36.616]  Paul Watson just continues to drop bombshell after bombshell on us.
[02:00:37.176 --> 02:00:47.044]  He was getting into the German magazine, newspaper, big one, last week, I forget the name, he wrote an article about it, talking to one of the members saying, you know, we basically run things, you know, we're one of the most powerful groups.
[02:00:47.625 --> 02:00:51.608]  We just talked to the Dutch leader of the parliament and the leader of the Labour Party.
[02:00:53.128 --> 02:00:55.510]  And he admitted they're in there setting policy.
[02:00:55.990 --> 02:01:04.417]  That clip needs to get put in an article that I know that some of the crews working on in there pointing out that they're setting policy and the files and the rest of it, but it's just confirmed.
[02:01:05.518 --> 02:01:09.120]  Dietrich Samson confirms they're setting policy, discussing policy.
[02:01:09.521 --> 02:01:11.002]  That's illegal in all these countries.
[02:01:12.045 --> 02:01:13.725]  I don't know about the Netherlands, but most of them it is.
[02:01:13.745 --> 02:01:16.446]  The U.S., England, Germany, we've checked into those.
[02:01:16.526 --> 02:01:20.667]  So, Logan Act, Official Meetings Act, all these things.
[02:01:21.427 --> 02:01:23.567]  Paul, for me this is the big issue.
[02:01:23.847 --> 02:01:31.589]  I know we can look at the media saying we're terrorists and, you know, Bin Laden believed in Bilderberg, so we're with Bin Laden when he was CIA.
[02:01:31.669 --> 02:01:35.950]  But, I mean, other than looking at media tactics, establishment media tactics,
[02:01:37.771 --> 02:01:38.572]  They're imploded.
[02:01:39.512 --> 02:01:41.614]  What do you think the biggest issue is this year?
[02:01:41.674 --> 02:01:44.256]  And would you say Bilderberg has peaked in coverage?
[02:01:44.716 --> 02:01:46.978]  Because I think we're getting more coverage this year than we got last year.
[02:01:47.218 --> 02:01:51.141]  We had much bigger crowds last year, but I think it's only getting bigger and bigger.
[02:01:51.481 --> 02:01:56.845]  And so I think the announcement that, you know, 12 years ago it peaked is like saying the moon's made of cheese.
[02:01:58.566 --> 02:02:00.007]  Well, it's just factually inaccurate.
[02:02:00.027 --> 02:02:03.270]  I mean, there were no protesters whatsoever outside Bilderberg 12 years ago.
[02:02:03.846 --> 02:02:08.791]  And then the rest of it was just, oh, world power is dispersed, it's moving over to the East.
[02:02:09.372 --> 02:02:11.634]  Just a litany of BS, basically.
[02:02:11.674 --> 02:02:19.402]  They failed to mention, of course, that they created the Euro, they were positioning themselves for the 2008 financial collapse two years before.
[02:02:20.323 --> 02:02:25.349]  Kingmakers in terms of Clinton, Blair, the 12 NATO Secretary Generals.
[02:02:26.343 --> 02:02:32.911]  Every single one of them has been a Bilderberg member, and many of them were selected by Bilderberg before they became the head of NATO.
[02:02:32.951 --> 02:02:41.040]  So as long as the mainstream media can avoid mentioning the actual facts that are confirmed, that prove they have power, that prove they have influence,
[02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:43.362]  Then they can continue to get away with it.
[02:02:43.643 --> 02:02:58.859]  I think that some kind of directive must have been issued to mention either 12-foot shape-shifting lizards or tinfoil hats in the first paragraphs of these articles because almost every single one that's a debunking piece mentions those two buzzwords.
[02:02:58.879 --> 02:02:59.340]  So again, it's
[02:03:00.342 --> 02:03:05.169]  Using this pejorative term, conspiracy theory, when this is conspiracy fact.
[02:03:05.850 --> 02:03:06.811]  We're not saying that.
[02:03:07.332 --> 02:03:09.675]  We have the documents proving it, but they're saying it.
[02:03:09.775 --> 02:03:10.957]  They come out and admit it.
[02:03:11.337 --> 02:03:16.725]  Willy Klass, another NATO Secretary General, came out in 2010 in a Belgian radio interview.
[02:03:17.225 --> 02:03:27.350]  And he said yes, we have power, we go in there, we set the consensus, then it's up to us, it's our mission to implement that consensus, that agreement, in our relative spheres of influence.
[02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:39.435]  So numerous Bilderberg members, prominent ones, including Etienne Davignon on the steering committee, have admitted that they set the consensus, they set the policy, and it's broadcast out amongst them.
[02:03:40.156 --> 02:03:40.676]  Of course they have
[02:03:41.590 --> 02:03:42.750]  People that they groom as well.
[02:03:42.990 --> 02:03:44.191]  The mayor of Atlanta's there.
[02:03:44.311 --> 02:03:53.213]  So, you know, is he Barack Obama 2.0 in eight years or so after they probably... And will he groom Queen Beatrice's stool?
[02:03:56.154 --> 02:03:58.295]  Well, we got Queen Sophia of Spain.
[02:03:58.975 --> 02:04:00.536]  I tweeted that out about an hour ago.
[02:04:00.636 --> 02:04:03.616]  So, actually, that was Skelton that got that one.
[02:04:03.756 --> 02:04:05.457]  Is that on your tweeting or on my tweeting?
[02:04:06.371 --> 02:04:08.832]  No, it's on real Alex Jones Tweety Pie.
[02:04:09.432 --> 02:04:12.033]  We got Petraeus on his jog as well.
[02:04:12.974 --> 02:04:19.497]  Peter Thiel, that's another interesting one because of course he put two million dollars into Bitcoin.
[02:04:20.017 --> 02:04:23.398]  I think Thiel is here to explain Bitcoin to Henry Kissinger.
[02:04:23.458 --> 02:04:24.659]  I knew it, I knew it.
[02:04:25.279 --> 02:04:29.741]  That's a very difficult task, to explain Bitcoin to Henry Kissinger.
[02:04:30.241 --> 02:04:34.103]  So, you know, a lot of people... Did you just coin a term Tweety Pie?
[02:04:35.373 --> 02:04:36.175]  Weetie Pie, yeah.
[02:04:38.058 --> 02:04:42.025]  But, um... That's kinda racist.
[02:04:42.045 --> 02:04:44.590]  I think it's... It's gotta be racist or sexist, but...
[02:04:45.817 --> 02:04:50.520]  Yes, they're trying to, um, they're trying to control Bitcoin, I think.
[02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:51.581]  That's why PTT was there.
[02:05:06.977 --> 02:05:09.818]  This is Leanne McAdoo for InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:05:10.098 --> 02:05:16.000]  I'm here with Dr. Edward Group, Master Herbologist and Chief Formulator behind the InfoWarsLife products.
[02:05:16.200 --> 02:05:20.621]  Dr. Group, what have you been hearing from women who've started taking Super Female Vitality?
[02:05:20.721 --> 02:05:27.263]  You know, we've heard the reviews and feedback from Super Male Vitality from emails to even excited callers on the radio.
[02:05:27.583 --> 02:05:29.485]  Now, the answer for women is here.
[02:05:29.625 --> 02:05:41.153]  A new formulation specifically designed for the female body, Super Female Vitality, delivers 10 key herbs that work synergistically to revitalize the unique biology of women.
[02:05:41.273 --> 02:05:43.255]  I'm so glad that you guys made this for women.
[02:05:43.295 --> 02:05:48.839]  When he brought me home, the bottle of Super Female, I had tons of energy, tons of motivation, a lot of drive.
[02:05:48.859 --> 02:05:50.220]  My husband thinks I've been in a better mood.
[02:05:50.240 --> 02:05:52.602]  Our relationship, all I can say is this is a lot better.
[02:05:52.995 --> 02:05:57.139]  I've just started taking Super Female Vitality from InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:05:57.359 --> 02:06:06.147]  Supplies are limited, so secure yours today at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or dial 1-888-253-3139.
[02:06:07.268 --> 02:06:11.291]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:06:11.331 --> 02:06:15.395]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:06:15.655 --> 02:06:19.058]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:06:19.318 --> 02:06:22.200]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:06:22.380 --> 02:06:29.726]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins of heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:06:29.946 --> 02:06:33.569]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:06:33.829 --> 02:06:38.090]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:06:38.270 --> 02:06:44.192]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:06:44.232 --> 02:06:47.993]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:06:48.173 --> 02:06:50.714]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:06:50.914 --> 02:06:52.255]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:06:52.415 --> 02:06:53.635]  It's time to take action.
[02:06:53.775 --> 02:06:55.496]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:07:07.261 --> 02:07:14.305]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:07:14.425 --> 02:07:16.587]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:07:16.767 --> 02:07:21.870]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:07:22.050 --> 02:07:26.993]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:07:27.213 --> 02:07:30.276]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:07:30.536 --> 02:07:34.400]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:07:34.600 --> 02:07:38.864]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:07:38.924 --> 02:07:48.974]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:07:49.174 --> 02:07:51.697]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:07:51.877 --> 02:07:59.944]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:08:00.084 --> 02:08:04.067]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:08:21.526 --> 02:08:25.407]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:08:26.067 --> 02:08:29.968]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:33.849 --> 02:08:44.391]  One big thing we've gotten out of one of the most powerful globalist meetings in the world, the very apex of control, Bilderberg 2014 in Copenhagen, Denmark, is that
[02:08:45.592 --> 02:08:47.133]  They're very mad at Obama.
[02:08:47.153 --> 02:08:49.034]  They thought he would literally be able to get more done.
[02:08:49.775 --> 02:08:51.676]  And they're talking about, what are they going to do with it?
[02:08:52.537 --> 02:08:56.119]  And you notice, they just had the head of the VA step down.
[02:08:56.139 --> 02:09:00.602]  Jay Carney is resigning right now, giving a teleconference, press conference.
[02:09:02.003 --> 02:09:04.345]  And so they're throwing a bunch of rats overboard.
[02:09:05.165 --> 02:09:09.688]  So that it looks like Obama, you know, is blaming all these people that are falling on the sword.
[02:09:10.169 --> 02:09:10.969]  It's not going to work.
[02:09:11.730 --> 02:09:14.292]  DrudgeReport.com is the headline, Obama cleans house.
[02:09:15.558 --> 02:09:24.401]  Another headline I noticed, record 3,100 days, 3,100 days since major hurricane strikes USA.
[02:09:25.442 --> 02:09:26.742]  And yeah, they said that last year.
[02:09:27.622 --> 02:09:28.923]  New hurricane season's about to start.
[02:09:29.523 --> 02:09:31.604]  Record low hurricanes for like four years.
[02:09:33.064 --> 02:09:35.005]  Lowest level of tornadoes since 1960.
[02:09:35.525 --> 02:09:37.026]  NOAA admitted that in their computer model.
[02:09:37.878 --> 02:09:43.601]  And then I'm on shows, Democrat shows, and they'll go, Jones, you know there's more hurricanes and tornadoes.
[02:09:43.681 --> 02:09:44.902]  And I'm like, no it's not.
[02:09:44.922 --> 02:09:46.263]  They're at record low.
[02:09:46.423 --> 02:09:47.003]  Oh yeah?
[02:09:47.284 --> 02:09:49.745]  Got any other conspiracy theories?
[02:09:50.586 --> 02:09:52.447]  It's just, it's just, people just...
[02:09:53.547 --> 02:09:56.128]  Just literally wallow in their ignorance nowadays.
[02:09:56.709 --> 02:09:59.690]  Finishing up with Paul Watson, they've moved over to a fellow that's got a bullhorn.
[02:10:00.010 --> 02:10:04.153]  The crowd, I guess there's a crowd of protesters now showing up, wants to get my view on it.
[02:10:04.213 --> 02:10:13.638]  I guess I can bullhorn the globalists from a distance if they're somehow able to rig up the thing to a microphone or send the Skype down.
[02:10:13.658 --> 02:10:14.498]  I don't know if there's a way to do it.
[02:10:14.778 --> 02:10:15.699]  I've done this before.
[02:10:16.519 --> 02:10:18.260]  It's like having my hologram there to do it.
[02:10:19.261 --> 02:10:21.323]  But if they can figure it out, I'd love to do it.
[02:10:21.343 --> 02:10:24.566]  Maybe we can just plug the earpiece directly into the jack on the megaphone.
[02:10:25.346 --> 02:10:25.747]  I don't know.
[02:10:25.787 --> 02:10:26.667]  I'm not there, obviously.
[02:10:26.687 --> 02:10:28.969]  I'm in FEMA Region 6, formerly Texas.
[02:10:29.830 --> 02:10:33.893]  But Watson, any other points before we go to this feed?
[02:10:38.898 --> 02:10:41.520]  And I guess they're having some really bad Skype issues right now.
[02:10:43.379 --> 02:10:45.240]  The Mars rover's not doing too well.
[02:10:45.300 --> 02:10:46.600]  Hey, Paul Watson, can you hear me?
[02:10:48.841 --> 02:10:50.042]  Paul, can you hear?
[02:10:50.062 --> 02:10:50.842]  It's very faint.
[02:10:51.703 --> 02:10:55.324]  Alright, Paul, any other points you want to make before we do this bullhorn stunt?
[02:10:56.285 --> 02:11:02.908]  Yeah, we should probably talk to Julia, who witnessed the interaction with a Bilderberg member earlier in the protest pen.
[02:11:03.648 --> 02:11:04.969]  So it's like the movie Aliens.
[02:11:05.369 --> 02:11:06.549]  Apparently she saw one.
[02:11:07.110 --> 02:11:08.270]  This is momentous.
[02:11:08.490 --> 02:11:08.750]  Yeah.
[02:11:09.471 --> 02:11:10.651]  We can do that quickly now.
[02:11:10.751 --> 02:11:11.492]  Yeah, let's talk to her.
[02:11:11.732 --> 02:11:12.072]  Here we go.
[02:11:12.813 --> 02:11:13.573]  Hey, Julia.
[02:11:17.556 --> 02:11:18.396]  Quick, quick.
[02:11:20.437 --> 02:11:21.798]  Quick, quick.
[02:11:23.059 --> 02:11:25.740]  Tell us what you witnessed earlier over in the protest area.
[02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:27.221]  Washington is directing the women around.
[02:11:27.361 --> 02:11:28.602]  Addressing the protesters.
[02:11:29.339 --> 02:11:47.118]  It was Dierdrik Samsom, who's actually on the list, and he's Dutch Labour Party and former Greenpeace member, and he came out and stood in front of the Freedom Pen and spoke to the protesters, and I was walking by to go back to my room, and
[02:11:47.873 --> 02:11:57.259]  The whole thing felt like he was trying to appease us or gauge the protesters for, you know, how they're feeling or what they think of the people tied in the Bilderberg group.
[02:11:57.639 --> 02:12:02.262]  And the whole time, you know, people were asking, some people were asking very interesting questions, like there was X
[02:12:03.503 --> 02:12:29.470]  He was a member of the Dutch Ministry of Labour, and he asked them about the Blackwater presence in Ukraine, and people were asking about healthcare and all this, and it was all misdirection, and all he kept talking about is these wonderful social policies that are being discussed inside, and how wonderful it is that the Dutch people are living longer, and the healthcare system's great, and how they're just discussing our future, and how they're trying to do their best for us with
[02:12:30.601 --> 02:12:31.081]  We're good to go.
[02:12:47.697 --> 02:12:48.298]  Wait a minute.
[02:12:48.398 --> 02:12:48.819]  Wait a minute.
[02:12:48.839 --> 02:12:49.480]  Tell her, hold on.
[02:12:49.580 --> 02:12:52.063]  She's a genius and I want to hear about her and where she's from.
[02:12:52.083 --> 02:12:52.484]  You're a genius.
[02:12:52.504 --> 02:12:53.185]  That's all I can say.
[02:12:53.225 --> 02:12:54.166]  No, seriously, she is.
[02:12:54.227 --> 02:12:55.989]  She just realized it was hiding in plain view.
[02:12:56.410 --> 02:13:03.560]  They're coming out and talking to people, now claiming their meetings public, because it's illegal in almost all those countries.
[02:13:04.541 --> 02:13:06.782]  I'm sure it's in all of them, but especially in Europe.
[02:13:07.162 --> 02:13:09.642]  But I don't know about the Netherlands specifically.
[02:13:10.063 --> 02:13:17.144]  So they want to now claim it's public and transparent because it really is super secret and now they're worried about criminal investigations.
[02:13:17.525 --> 02:13:25.147]  So I think they're trying to now have it both ways and be able to argue in legalese that it's really a public meeting, but that's not going to hold water.
[02:13:25.467 --> 02:13:27.167]  She figured it out.
[02:13:27.647 --> 02:13:30.348]  Will Watson tell her that she is Sherlock Holmes?
[02:13:32.650 --> 02:13:34.232]  Alex says that you're Sherlock Holmes.
[02:13:34.433 --> 02:13:41.042]  The point he made was they're worried about criminal investigations and transparency so they're getting more desperate and having to address us more.
[02:13:41.062 --> 02:13:42.163]  What do you think about that?
[02:13:43.525 --> 02:13:44.787]  To be honest, I don't know.
[02:13:44.807 --> 02:13:45.889]  It felt like Sherlock Holmes.
[02:13:46.718 --> 02:13:48.860]  Maybe they said somebody go out there and talk to them.
[02:13:49.340 --> 02:14:02.770]  The fact that he was talking to the loud, more radical protesters within the pen, when there were several people outside, talked to him directly, he didn't want to engage those people.
[02:14:03.010 --> 02:14:05.032]  And it felt like he was just trying to
[02:14:06.492 --> 02:14:13.176]  And to go back and declare what we're thinking, what we're talking about, and what the little people are saying outside.
[02:14:13.496 --> 02:14:23.981]  It felt like a little, it felt like a game he... Well, but more than that, they want to go to the wild people so that the mainstream media can shoot it and make us look bad and make them look good.
[02:14:24.381 --> 02:14:25.462]  That doesn't work anymore.
[02:14:25.542 --> 02:14:26.262]  Folks are angry.
[02:14:26.282 --> 02:14:26.983]  They're gonna like...
[02:14:27.443 --> 02:14:29.204]  The fact that the folks are angry.
[02:14:29.604 --> 02:14:31.626]  That's why the media doesn't get its backfiring.
[02:14:31.846 --> 02:14:36.129]  They're coming from an elitist perspective and also a 50-year-old perspective.
[02:14:37.009 --> 02:14:39.151]  It's like dinosaurs fighting Star Destroyers.
[02:14:39.511 --> 02:14:40.872]  They just don't have any hope.
[02:14:41.592 --> 02:14:44.354]  Paul Watson, get her to tell us about herself.
[02:14:44.394 --> 02:14:47.136]  I think it's interesting to see where she's from, why she came out.
[02:14:47.496 --> 02:14:48.757]  I know she's been out there for two days.
[02:14:49.758 --> 02:14:51.219]  She's been with you guys.
[02:14:51.879 --> 02:14:52.840]  Get her to tell us about herself.
[02:14:54.862 --> 02:15:00.207]  My name is Julia Transke and I have a channel called Raise the World and I guess that's what I'm doing here.
[02:15:03.430 --> 02:15:16.882]  I'm from Toronto and what's the most interesting thing to me currently about the meeting is it's a little bit more narrow-minded than what you guys are doing but I'm really into Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and all that and Peter Thiel is here.
[02:15:18.622 --> 02:15:35.238]  You said dinosaurs and there is this like antediluvian kind of presence here because there's such old people and I think Peter Thiel is here to maybe explain Bitcoin to them and kind of give them an in on what they're having to deal with in terms of control.
[02:15:35.298 --> 02:15:35.658]  I don't know.
[02:15:35.678 --> 02:15:36.599]  He's supposed to be on our side.
[02:15:36.619 --> 02:15:38.701]  He's supposed to be the self-proclaimed libertarian.
[02:15:39.062 --> 02:15:41.444]  I'm very interested in that and I don't know.
[02:15:41.544 --> 02:15:41.804]  I know
[02:15:43.115 --> 02:15:52.322]  I know that it's a very difficult thing to do to make these jumps in rationalizing what they're doing, what they're talking about, and why people are there.
[02:15:52.342 --> 02:15:52.822]  Sure, sure.
[02:15:52.862 --> 02:15:53.743]  But listen, listen.
[02:15:53.943 --> 02:15:59.066]  They know about fiat currencies, and they know about derivatives and stuff.
[02:15:59.086 --> 02:16:02.489]  Believe me, their great-great granddaddies wrote the book.
[02:16:03.790 --> 02:16:05.411]  On things like Bitcoin.
[02:16:05.451 --> 02:16:07.132]  And again, I'm not saying Bitcoin's purely bad.
[02:16:07.152 --> 02:16:11.236]  I just, and I know it's racing up right now and everybody's making all this money.
[02:16:11.696 --> 02:16:16.120]  I just know when the bubble implodes, if I promote it, I will be blamed for it.
[02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:18.021]  So that's why I've been a bit wary.
[02:16:18.041 --> 02:16:22.245]  But more power to people creating their own fiat currency, because at least it competes with the globalists.
[02:16:22.685 --> 02:16:27.729]  I don't like the fact that they're the only ones that can make money off their Federal Reserve System.
[02:16:27.749 --> 02:16:29.591]  I think they're worried about it.
[02:16:29.611 --> 02:16:30.812]  I think that's why he's there.
[02:16:32.043 --> 02:16:33.364]  I mean, it's interesting to me.
[02:16:34.144 --> 02:16:37.325]  I'm kind of more hopeful about that fact.
[02:16:37.505 --> 02:16:48.649]  I think it's a good sign that he's there, and I think their ears are perked up about the possibility of sovereignty through currency, for the people, instead of money being power.
[02:16:48.789 --> 02:16:50.009]  Who controls money being power?
[02:16:50.249 --> 02:16:53.130]  Instead, money being power in the hands of the people.
[02:16:53.571 --> 02:16:57.192]  So, that's my biggest interest this year.
[02:16:57.492 --> 02:17:01.016]  Well, they're getting ready to get rid of a lot of world currencies and want a new fiat one they control.
[02:17:01.056 --> 02:17:06.883]  They're looking at a global carbon tax to underpin and give value to the new SDR system.
[02:17:07.384 --> 02:17:11.809]  And again, when I send packages overseas, it says SDR on the USPS.
[02:17:12.189 --> 02:17:14.152]  So we're already under a global SDR.
[02:17:14.212 --> 02:17:15.253]  They've said that at Davos.
[02:17:15.273 --> 02:17:17.115]  A hundred trillion dollars they want.
[02:17:18.557 --> 02:17:25.642]  Well, I guess I'll end with, sorry Alex, they're talking about the future of renewable resources and it's all for our own good, as Mr. Simpson says.
[02:17:46.758 --> 02:17:54.161]  Um, you know, I am, but it's like a blanket of despotism here, and I really react to it in a negative way.
[02:17:54.181 --> 02:18:02.485]  I had a nightmare the first night I was here, and it involves me being taken captive at the Marriott by these people.
[02:18:03.325 --> 02:18:13.270]  There's a really, really sinister feeling that I'm not just imagining, because I came here with no ideas and no expectations, and just this
[02:18:13.810 --> 02:18:17.094]  So you're picking up the creepy crawlies of David Rockefeller or Kissinger?
[02:18:17.114 --> 02:18:19.497]  Who do you think you're picking the creepy crawlies up from?
[02:18:19.517 --> 02:18:23.802]  Yeah, maybe Kissinger.
[02:18:24.563 --> 02:18:27.006]  He's quite a troll, isn't he?
[02:18:27.266 --> 02:18:28.608]  You don't think he's hot?
[02:18:31.251 --> 02:18:33.534]  Who do you like better, Paul Watson or Henry Kissinger?
[02:18:36.011 --> 02:18:36.552]  Oh, of course.
[02:18:36.712 --> 02:18:37.092]  Paul.
[02:18:37.652 --> 02:18:39.333]  I'm going to stop being bad.
[02:18:39.353 --> 02:18:39.794]  I'm going to quit.
[02:18:39.834 --> 02:18:40.254]  I'm going to quit.
[02:18:40.454 --> 02:18:41.455]  Hey, it was nice to meet you.
[02:18:41.775 --> 02:18:42.576]  I appreciate that.
[02:18:42.736 --> 02:18:44.177]  Tell folks your channel one more time.

[02:18:54.056 --> 02:18:54.417]  Take care.
[02:19:11.383 --> 02:19:14.427]  No, we could walk over there and try that, definitely.
[02:19:31.587 --> 02:19:35.369]  Digital downloads, and then we'll have it all for you tonight on the Nightly News.

[02:24:06.949 --> 02:24:12.234]  Again, if you just joined us, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[02:24:12.414 --> 02:24:15.037]  Obama has made Jay Carney the twit.
[02:24:29.330 --> 02:24:31.291]  The worst lie I've ever seen falling a sword.
[02:24:31.311 --> 02:24:32.191]  He is resigning.
[02:24:33.171 --> 02:24:36.692]  So is General Kinseki, the head of the Veterans Affairs.
[02:24:36.712 --> 02:24:39.713]  I mean, this has all been done by design.
[02:24:40.213 --> 02:24:45.975]  It's gotten much worse under Obama by design to cheat the veterans and steal the money set aside for their health care.
[02:24:46.655 --> 02:24:47.815]  And it's been ordered.
[02:24:47.895 --> 02:24:48.735]  It's not an accident.
[02:24:49.076 --> 02:24:50.116]  This is all a big diversion.
[02:24:50.156 --> 02:24:52.276]  It will continue on until we wake up to that.
[02:24:52.697 --> 02:24:53.777]  We take you now back
[02:24:55.562 --> 02:24:57.504]  To Copenhagen and their Skype just died.
[02:24:57.524 --> 02:24:58.505]  We're going to reconnect with them.
[02:24:58.765 --> 02:25:00.967]  Here's the toll-free number to join us for the next segment.
[02:25:00.987 --> 02:25:01.908]  I'll go right to your calls.
[02:25:01.928 --> 02:25:02.108]  800-259-9231.
[02:25:02.128 --> 02:25:02.168]  800-259-9231.
[02:25:10.066 --> 02:25:10.747]  You agree with me.
[02:25:10.807 --> 02:25:11.648]  You disagree with me.
[02:25:11.968 --> 02:25:12.990]  You got a Bilderberg point.
[02:25:13.010 --> 02:25:17.535]  You want to talk about all the rats jumping off the Titanic that is Obama?
[02:25:17.555 --> 02:25:18.316]  800-259-9231.
[02:25:18.336 --> 02:25:21.801]  And yes, Obama's a puppet.
[02:25:21.861 --> 02:25:22.782]  Yes, he's a front man.
[02:25:22.822 --> 02:25:23.663]  Yes, Michelle is.
[02:25:24.124 --> 02:25:24.945]  It doesn't matter.
[02:25:25.045 --> 02:25:28.609]  You have to destroy their graven image.
[02:25:30.029 --> 02:25:38.437]  That they have got their whole agenda on, and then the next puppet, and the next puppet, and then, say, this person's bad, and then there's these people behind it.
[02:25:38.897 --> 02:25:40.519]  That's how human communication works.
[02:25:41.760 --> 02:25:43.362]  That's how we defeat their operations.
[02:25:43.402 --> 02:25:47.926]  We expose their global warming thing as a global taxing scam to control and regulate everything.
[02:25:49.158 --> 02:25:54.620]  We exposed gun control as a way to disarm us and make us slaves under their authoritarianism, while they armed the teeth against us.
[02:25:55.400 --> 02:25:57.641]  Now, towns and cities, it's all over the news.
[02:25:58.081 --> 02:25:59.402]  Why are the police getting tanks?
[02:25:59.782 --> 02:26:01.342]  Why are they trying to take on the Tea Party?
[02:26:02.182 --> 02:26:03.303]  Fire the police chief!
[02:26:03.363 --> 02:26:04.263]  I mean, it's happening!
[02:26:06.504 --> 02:26:08.745]  The state houses are coming out, talking like me.
[02:26:09.725 --> 02:26:11.426]  And I'm not on a power trip about that, folks.
[02:26:11.586 --> 02:26:16.067]  I've studied history, because I was into history instead of comic books and stuff when I was a kid.
[02:26:17.048 --> 02:26:17.828]  It was more entertaining.
[02:26:19.138 --> 02:26:24.881]  I mean, I'd read, like, time-life books on World War II and World War I and stuff and other things, and there was other kids like comic books.
[02:26:24.921 --> 02:26:26.061]  This was the real comic book.
[02:26:26.561 --> 02:26:28.562]  I mean, I wanted to learn more about Heinrich Himmler.
[02:26:29.102 --> 02:26:32.024]  I wanted to learn more about Julius Caesar.
[02:26:32.484 --> 02:26:37.106]  I wanted to learn more about the Emperor Hirohito of Japan.
[02:26:37.266 --> 02:26:42.708]  I wanted to learn about British royalty.
[02:26:42.808 --> 02:26:44.389]  I wanted to learn about George Washington.
[02:26:45.189 --> 02:26:46.230]  And so when I saw
[02:26:47.961 --> 02:26:51.442]  What was happening in high school and college, I was like, this is history repeating.
[02:26:52.102 --> 02:26:53.523]  And they're like, nothing's happening.
[02:26:53.903 --> 02:26:55.303]  There's no corruption in government.
[02:26:55.523 --> 02:26:56.664]  There's no secret groups.
[02:26:56.964 --> 02:26:58.184]  There's no court intrigue.
[02:26:59.004 --> 02:27:00.145]  And I went, you're lying.
[02:27:02.145 --> 02:27:03.746]  And I said, I'm gonna fight you.
[02:27:05.166 --> 02:27:07.207]  And here we are, 19 years later.
[02:27:07.647 --> 02:27:08.467]  I'm 40 years old.
[02:27:10.508 --> 02:27:11.008]  I'm nobody.
[02:27:12.076 --> 02:27:29.310]  When I say we are setting the agenda more and more, it should show you that if you will just believe in yourself, learn how things work, stand up and get involved, you'll be incredibly successful in business, you'll be incredibly successful in life with everything, if you can just find good team members.
[02:27:29.770 --> 02:27:35.555]  Because it's not enough for you to get your act together, or for me to do that, to get your you-know-what together.
[02:27:35.595 --> 02:27:36.916]  There's another word that says it better.
[02:27:38.795 --> 02:27:42.837]  You've got to learn to get the proper family around you and the proper crew.
[02:27:43.277 --> 02:27:50.061]  Because it doesn't matter how smart you are or committed, you get the wrong people around you, they will bring you down every time.
[02:27:52.342 --> 02:28:02.707]  And, you know, sometimes you have relationships that are like time bombs, that go on for decades and then get so bad, your loyalty is used against you, and you're forced to cut people off and cut them out of your life.
[02:28:03.027 --> 02:28:04.928]  And as you get older, you learn to do that quicker and quicker.
[02:28:06.629 --> 02:28:07.890]  You can get too quick, too, though.
[02:28:08.863 --> 02:28:14.127]  But there's just all these predators out there, and I don't like them.
[02:28:15.468 --> 02:28:16.408]  We ever get their Skype back?
[02:28:18.450 --> 02:28:19.070]  Just got it back.
[02:28:19.090 --> 02:28:19.630]  Great job.
[02:28:19.710 --> 02:28:21.872]  Okay, let's go back to Copenhagen.
[02:28:23.153 --> 02:28:24.013]  Sure, we'll fullscreen it.
[02:28:25.935 --> 02:28:27.576]  Again, I'm the director of my own show here.
[02:28:28.216 --> 02:28:29.017]  Crew are just amazing.
[02:28:29.677 --> 02:28:31.619]  It's just kind of like a train wreck sometimes, but that's good.
[02:28:31.659 --> 02:28:31.959]  It's real.
[02:28:33.834 --> 02:28:36.555]  In fact, maybe I shouldn't care sometimes people are being noisy or tromping around.
[02:28:36.575 --> 02:28:37.075]  I mean, this is real.
[02:28:37.135 --> 02:28:40.536]  We should probably put a microphone out there that just randomly folks can tune into.
[02:28:40.556 --> 02:28:42.117]  No, I'm joking.
[02:28:42.137 --> 02:28:43.518]  Okay, they're walking down right now.
[02:28:44.818 --> 02:28:49.580]  Here, let's get some of the ambient noise on the street there at the capital city of Copenhagen of Denmark.
[02:28:49.940 --> 02:28:50.340]  Here it is.
[02:28:56.182 --> 02:28:58.223]  Nice, classical architecture.
[02:28:58.903 --> 02:29:00.704]  Very genteel people, very clean.
[02:29:03.450 --> 02:29:05.332]  And what you see is the old Europe.
[02:29:05.412 --> 02:29:07.854]  It's pretty much dead on arrival.
[02:29:08.074 --> 02:29:08.495]  1.2 children.
[02:29:08.515 --> 02:29:10.637]  1.3 for every two adults.
[02:29:11.317 --> 02:29:12.979]  Will not exist within 50 years.
[02:29:13.179 --> 02:29:13.519]  Gone.
[02:29:15.421 --> 02:29:16.962]  Gone, gone, gone!
[02:29:18.744 --> 02:29:20.466]  Gone to women, gone to drink!
[02:29:22.327 --> 02:29:22.928]  Gone!
[02:29:25.570 --> 02:29:26.351]  Gone to whiskey!
[02:29:27.312 --> 02:29:28.653]  What's that quote from the new True Grit?
[02:29:28.673 --> 02:29:29.294]  It's a pretty good movie.
[02:29:31.582 --> 02:29:32.522]  I do not have your $100.
[02:29:33.903 --> 02:29:34.643]  It's gone.
[02:29:35.383 --> 02:29:37.184]  Gone, gone to whiskey.
[02:29:38.044 --> 02:29:38.804]  Gone to women.
[02:29:40.025 --> 02:29:42.525]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back.
[02:29:43.065 --> 02:29:46.106]  Before you know it, your life's gonna be gone, gone, gone.
[02:29:46.666 --> 02:29:49.467]  You wanna be a drone of these people that think they're human and you're not?
[02:29:49.827 --> 02:29:51.728]  Or you wanna take your destiny in your hands?
[02:29:53.214 --> 02:29:55.400]  I know I'm a rebel spirit against these tyrants.
[02:29:55.600 --> 02:29:56.482]  We're on the march.
[02:29:57.004 --> 02:29:58.587]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:59.530 --> 02:30:02.216]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:06.727 --> 02:30:07.528]  I don't know what it is.
[02:30:07.748 --> 02:30:09.489]  Ralph just won't pay any attention to me.
[02:30:09.629 --> 02:30:13.551]  When he comes home from work, all he ever does is play video games and go to sleep.
[02:30:13.752 --> 02:30:14.972]  It's like I don't even exist.
[02:30:15.333 --> 02:30:17.154]  Oh Betty, that's just awful.
[02:30:17.294 --> 02:30:18.495]  Does this seem familiar?
[02:30:18.655 --> 02:30:21.256]  If the answer to this question is yes, then listen carefully.
[02:30:21.397 --> 02:30:26.640]  Toxic pesticides, GMO foods and additives, BPA plastics, contaminated water supplies.
[02:30:26.820 --> 02:30:31.723]  Many of these toxic additives are deliberately engineered to attack and weaken human masculinity.
[02:30:31.863 --> 02:30:34.305]  It's part of the eugenics population control movement.
[02:30:34.545 --> 02:30:35.006]  Look it up.
[02:30:35.246 --> 02:30:41.933]  If men are more interested in online gaming than they are in their wives, a serious population crisis is soon to follow.
[02:30:42.113 --> 02:30:47.239]  Energize the man in your life with Super Male Vitality from InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:31:06.818 --> 02:31:12.922]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[02:31:12.942 --> 02:31:16.284]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[02:31:16.384 --> 02:31:17.985]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[02:31:18.045 --> 02:31:24.269]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[02:31:24.389 --> 02:31:30.293]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[02:31:30.433 --> 02:31:34.195]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[02:31:34.395 --> 02:31:37.277]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[02:31:37.297 --> 02:31:45.482]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[02:31:45.762 --> 02:31:47.803]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[02:31:47.863 --> 02:31:48.884]  It's a war against the truth.
[02:31:49.244 --> 02:31:57.987]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[02:32:07.261 --> 02:32:09.022]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[02:32:09.563 --> 02:32:16.527]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[02:32:16.987 --> 02:32:27.414]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[02:32:27.835 --> 02:32:37.061]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[02:32:37.781 --> 02:32:41.222]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[02:32:41.842 --> 02:32:45.263]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[02:32:45.603 --> 02:32:47.164]  Experience the new formula.
[02:32:47.664 --> 02:32:49.645]  Experience the ancient purity.
[02:32:50.245 --> 02:32:51.205]  Shield your family.
[02:32:51.565 --> 02:32:52.946]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:32:53.386 --> 02:32:55.987]  Available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:56.547 --> 02:33:00.528]  X2 from InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:33:18.314 --> 02:33:19.977]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:20.417 --> 02:33:21.819]  Because there is a war on.
[02:33:22.140 --> 02:33:22.740]  Or your mind.
[02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:35.057]  Another John Carpenter masterpiece bringing us in.
[02:33:38.550 --> 02:33:40.412]  You know, you may think the movie Halloween's scary.
[02:33:40.452 --> 02:33:43.354]  I think, uh, The New World Order's scary, what they're doing.
[02:33:43.814 --> 02:33:56.645]  Acting all friendly and nice in their suits, while they figure out with corporations how to put stuff into all the major food linings that sterilize you and your family and give you horrible degenerative diseases, and then you can even find books they've written bragging about it.
[02:33:57.657 --> 02:33:59.859]  Well, they all sit around and tell him, we don't exist!
[02:34:00.199 --> 02:34:00.800]  We don't exist!
[02:34:00.900 --> 02:34:02.041]  You do exist!
[02:34:02.822 --> 02:34:04.003]  And we're exposing you.
[02:34:04.684 --> 02:34:09.028]  Alright, let's shift gears right now and go back to Paul Watson, finally, before I go to calls there.
[02:34:09.048 --> 02:34:13.252]  And he's with a reporter who got photos of the Atlanta mayor there.
[02:34:13.292 --> 02:34:14.113]  Very exciting, Paul.
[02:34:14.133 --> 02:34:16.275]  And then maybe we can shove the camera through the fence.
[02:34:16.575 --> 02:34:20.740]  Where is this you're able to get these shots of them outside having cocktails?
[02:34:20.760 --> 02:34:21.941]  The Builder Rats.
[02:34:23.317 --> 02:34:25.618]  Um, it's round the side of the Marriott.
[02:34:25.698 --> 02:34:27.839]  It's across from the Nike building.
[02:34:27.859 --> 02:34:32.801]  So it's just adjacent to the Marriott, next to the bridge, next to the water.
[02:34:32.901 --> 02:34:34.221]  So it's a really good spot.
[02:34:34.621 --> 02:34:38.583]  They didn't allow us in there a couple of days ago, but they've opened it up.
[02:34:38.643 --> 02:34:40.444]  So we were able to get in there earlier.
[02:34:40.464 --> 02:34:48.807]  And yeah, as I said, United and D'Avignon, Wolfensohn and Eric Schmidt basically came out for a quick drink after their initial conference.
[02:34:48.967 --> 02:34:50.848]  And we were there pretty much for a few hours.
[02:34:50.868 --> 02:34:51.808]  We got some good shots.
[02:34:52.448 --> 02:34:59.532]  I got some video and then we got it up on the website and then we came back and obviously now there are more of them there having probably after-dinner drinks.
[02:34:59.672 --> 02:35:01.994]  Well listen, we can even do a little bit of overdrive, five minutes or so.
[02:35:02.074 --> 02:35:03.355]  Get over there and show that.
[02:35:03.375 --> 02:35:04.875]  I want to see a live feed of that.
[02:35:04.915 --> 02:35:05.816]  That's amazing.
[02:35:06.536 --> 02:35:09.498]  And again, I figured they were blocking the main walkway that's public.
[02:35:09.518 --> 02:35:10.839]  That's why they had to probably open that.
[02:35:10.859 --> 02:35:15.962]  Because I was marveling that they blocked the boardwalk for the whole city just because they felt like it.
[02:35:16.262 --> 02:35:18.183]  Because the royalty is there, literal royalty.
[02:35:18.804 --> 02:35:20.364]  Who got the photo of the Queen?
[02:35:21.365 --> 02:35:22.125]  David Knight's wife?
[02:35:23.366 --> 02:35:24.127]  Queen of Spain?
[02:35:24.987 --> 02:35:26.408]  Queen of Spain, that was Skelton.
[02:35:27.368 --> 02:35:31.411]  Princess Beatrice, the former Queen of Netherlands, was out there earlier.
[02:35:31.451 --> 02:35:33.652]  So, yeah, we got quite a few.
[02:35:33.832 --> 02:35:34.753]  We got some good shots.
[02:35:35.033 --> 02:35:40.136]  And do you have that reporter with you that took the snapshot of the Atlanta mayor?
[02:35:41.837 --> 02:35:43.038]  No, I don't know who that was.
[02:35:43.118 --> 02:35:44.498]  I wasn't around when that was happening.
[02:35:44.538 --> 02:35:46.399]  OK, I must have misunderstood something.
[02:35:46.419 --> 02:35:48.140]  They popped in my ear and said that they
[02:35:49.628 --> 02:35:52.510]  Have that person was able to be for an interview, but I must have misunderstood.
[02:35:52.530 --> 02:36:00.977]  Now, Paul, again, specifically, I want you guys to go over to that area, and you said there's more of them there now.
[02:36:01.658 --> 02:36:06.642]  Have we deposited one of our photographers over there, secreted someone there to be catching all this?
[02:36:07.283 --> 02:36:08.864]  We were just there earlier.
[02:36:08.984 --> 02:36:10.465]  We got tons of photos earlier.
[02:36:10.585 --> 02:36:12.327]  We were just broadcasting from there earlier.
[02:36:13.127 --> 02:36:14.148]  So that's where you were at?
[02:36:14.429 --> 02:36:14.629]  Okay.
[02:36:15.289 --> 02:36:16.130]  Well, I misunderstood.
[02:36:16.150 --> 02:36:18.272]  I guess you're now in the protest pen then.
[02:36:19.090 --> 02:36:19.270]  Yeah.
[02:36:20.130 --> 02:36:24.371]  Okay, so I was saying go where you already were, so now you've gone to the other place.
[02:36:24.451 --> 02:36:26.872]  Okay, what do you think you guys should go cover next?
[02:36:28.872 --> 02:36:31.252]  In terms of tonight or tomorrow, what do you mean, Alex?
[02:36:31.513 --> 02:36:33.533]  Well, the Bilderberg people are only going to get drunker.
[02:36:35.273 --> 02:36:37.574]  And they follow their own rules, so they're out there smoking.
[02:36:38.254 --> 02:36:43.235]  So I would go nest out there and I would get a night vision camera and you're going to get a bonanza.
[02:36:44.574 --> 02:36:47.555]  Yeah, well, we've been there pretty much most of the day, really.
[02:36:47.955 --> 02:36:49.615]  Also, they don't let them bring hookers in.
[02:36:50.135 --> 02:36:51.576]  They're gonna try to leave at night.
[02:36:52.216 --> 02:36:55.416]  And if you tail the Mercedes out of there, you could catch some really good stuff.
[02:36:57.077 --> 02:36:59.417]  That's something we did in Switzerland, I remember, in 2011.
[02:37:00.257 --> 02:37:06.019]  They weren't happy about that, but... I mean, if you're willing to go in the gay bar, you can go in there and get some pretty good intel.
[02:37:06.239 --> 02:37:07.119]  Which I don't think it's a big deal.
[02:37:07.139 --> 02:37:07.919]  Go ahead and go in there, Paul.
[02:37:08.799 --> 02:37:11.480]  I mean, it might be an S&M place or something, but I mean, just, you know...
[02:37:12.372 --> 02:37:21.957]  We actually talked to somebody who was a gay escort back in 2011 who went to service some Bilderberg members, only as bar staff, obviously, then they're up to nothing untoward.
[02:37:22.778 --> 02:37:35.625]  But, yeah, as I said, there's a potential of walkabouts happening tomorrow, so that's when we hope to catch some of them out of their protected bubble, out of their security bubble, so then we can really get some good conversations.
[02:37:36.636 --> 02:37:37.416]  Amazing, Paul.
[02:37:37.436 --> 02:37:39.877]  Yeah, and I mean, I wasn't joking when I said that.
[02:37:39.897 --> 02:37:41.058]  I wasn't just making a joke.
[02:37:41.878 --> 02:37:51.082]  And I was just saying, statistically, that's where, if you follow some of them, you would find them going for whatever reason.
[02:37:51.482 --> 02:37:52.522]  That would be newsworthy.
[02:37:53.143 --> 02:37:56.724]  But, you know, kind of morally, maybe we should leave them alone if they're going to visit hookers.
[02:37:56.844 --> 02:37:57.264]  You know what I mean?
[02:37:57.304 --> 02:37:58.605]  Isn't that their private business, Paul?
[02:38:02.107 --> 02:38:06.952]  If they're hanging around the hotel, if they're going for jogs, they're going for walks, which I expect at least some of them to do.
[02:38:06.972 --> 02:38:14.679]  Of course, in Bilderberg, they were surrounded by a lot of security, but this year, like Petraeus, for example, he went outside of the protected area.
[02:38:14.699 --> 02:38:18.343]  He just basically ran along the main street in Copenhagen across the bridge.
[02:38:19.284 --> 02:38:22.647]  So, if more of them are going to do that, then that's going to be a good opportunity.
[02:38:22.887 --> 02:38:23.908]  No, no, no, I agree.
[02:38:24.568 --> 02:38:28.151]  I was just making the quasi-joke about the prostitutes, but it really is true.
[02:38:28.691 --> 02:38:32.254]  My whole issue is, that's not the type of intel we even want.
[02:38:32.294 --> 02:38:40.900]  We don't care what, you know, shoe size somebody is, or what their favorite, you know, dinner is, or, you know, where they like to vacation, or what their sexual issues are.
[02:38:41.441 --> 02:38:47.305]  What we want to know is from staff and people, as you know, what were they really discussing on the agenda?
[02:38:50.064 --> 02:38:52.165]  Well, we know that they leaked the vague agenda.
[02:38:52.685 --> 02:38:56.386]  I'm hoping to get some more tips and, you know, more specific stuff.
[02:38:56.706 --> 02:39:05.408]  And that, sometimes that comes, sometimes it doesn't, but I'm just talking about just approaching them in a friendly manner, as we did last year with Ed Ford.
[02:39:05.528 --> 02:39:06.388]  Sure, sure, I agree.
[02:39:06.408 --> 02:39:15.370]  Can you have him pan around, the camera guy, Josh, so we can see some of the protesters there in the pen and see what they're up to?
[02:39:16.653 --> 02:39:18.195]  And again, if you're a radio listener, I'll describe it.
[02:39:18.215 --> 02:39:20.857]  Looks like about 25, 30 protesters max.
[02:39:21.698 --> 02:39:22.118]  That I've seen.
[02:39:22.138 --> 02:39:23.159]  Well, I guess there's some more.
[02:39:23.199 --> 02:39:24.541]  Maybe, maybe 40.
[02:39:24.701 --> 02:39:24.541]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
[02:39:26.002 --> 02:39:26.523]  What would you say?
[02:39:26.543 --> 02:39:28.044]  About 40 people there now?
[02:39:28.084 --> 02:39:29.145]  Yeah, probably about that.
[02:39:29.185 --> 02:39:31.207]  Maybe a bit less.
[02:39:39.264 --> 02:39:41.809]  Yeah, tomorrow's gonna be the big day for protests, obviously.
[02:39:42.410 --> 02:39:43.752]  I mean, it's not gonna be 2,000.
[02:39:43.893 --> 02:39:49.824]  I think that was wildly optimistic, but... You know, I think it was well over 3,000 that were there for the big speech.
[02:39:50.184 --> 02:39:51.346]  That's what the cops said in England.
[02:39:52.628 --> 02:39:53.348]  They couldn't get in.
[02:39:53.368 --> 02:39:54.628]  They were queuing around the block.
[02:39:54.788 --> 02:39:55.849]  I mean, that was wild.
[02:39:55.869 --> 02:39:57.449]  Hey, let me bring up this cop controversy.
[02:39:57.469 --> 02:39:58.609]  I don't want you to run back over there.
[02:39:58.629 --> 02:39:59.049]  I'm sorry.
[02:39:59.129 --> 02:40:00.009]  We got our wires crossed.
[02:40:00.049 --> 02:40:03.810]  And with the camera, show me them out there eating and drinking.
[02:40:03.830 --> 02:40:06.111]  I think the viewers would obviously want to see that.
[02:40:06.151 --> 02:40:08.491]  We have some of those videos up on Infowars.com.
[02:40:08.511 --> 02:40:10.731]  But as they gather, I want to stay on top of that.
[02:40:10.751 --> 02:40:11.452]  That's important.
[02:40:12.372 --> 02:40:18.493]  But going back to the police and this guy that was yelling at you and yelling at David and yelling about me,
[02:40:19.932 --> 02:40:24.275]  I mean, we make jokes about it, but they did drag him off and it looks like they're stomping on him and hitting him.
[02:40:24.695 --> 02:40:28.017]  Now maybe, maybe he hit them first, but they took him behind a screen.
[02:40:28.457 --> 02:40:29.378]  That's my issue.
[02:40:30.299 --> 02:40:33.481]  But, you know, now the media is acting like we're being too hard on the police.
[02:40:34.315 --> 02:40:34.495]  Well,
[02:40:58.547 --> 02:41:02.668]  Obviously this guy was harassing us for a good hour or two beforehand.
[02:41:03.548 --> 02:41:11.630]  I think he tried to get back into the press area and the police stopped him and he was very insistent on getting back in towards us.
[02:41:12.190 --> 02:41:15.070]  I didn't understand that he'd been doing it for hours and had been already thrown out.
[02:41:15.410 --> 02:41:16.891]  Well then I think he deserved to be arrested.
[02:41:16.911 --> 02:41:17.631]  I didn't know that.
[02:41:18.431 --> 02:41:22.212]  Because he got a press area just for the press and then he did that and then maybe he resists them.
[02:41:22.252 --> 02:41:23.092]  So maybe we're wrong then.
[02:41:24.420 --> 02:41:24.620]  Go ahead.
[02:41:24.640 --> 02:41:26.002]  Did he look roughed up when you saw him?
[02:41:40.223 --> 02:41:42.285]  I don't think he had many injuries.
[02:41:43.066 --> 02:41:48.591]  It may have been wrong to drag him off in that manner, but some of the police are on little ego trips, little power trips.
[02:41:48.611 --> 02:41:56.077]  Like I said with the guy, you can't stick your camera two inches through the metal fence when we're already, you know, 50 feet away from Bilderberg members.
[02:41:57.218 --> 02:41:58.480]  Most of them have been alright.
[02:41:58.880 --> 02:42:03.104]  Some of them are just on little power trips and they like to enforce these ridiculous rules.
[02:42:03.704 --> 02:42:10.448]  So, you know, it's a mixed bag as always with the police and we'll see what happens in future when, you know, more people show up.
[02:42:11.848 --> 02:42:15.650]  Now, this guy went through a lot of trouble to attack us.
[02:42:15.730 --> 02:42:16.891]  I think we should give him some air time.
[02:42:17.351 --> 02:42:19.552]  I'm interested in what he's saying.
[02:42:19.773 --> 02:42:21.493]  Repeat verbatim what he says about us.
[02:42:22.914 --> 02:42:31.859]  He was saying that we report that dinosaurs existed and that we're part of the conspiracy and that you're a CIA agent, basically.
[02:42:33.107 --> 02:42:34.328]  Alex Jones is CIA.
[02:42:34.368 --> 02:42:35.009]  Your response?
[02:42:35.529 --> 02:42:36.810]  That's what he says over and over again.
[02:42:37.110 --> 02:42:41.193]  I think he's a bit unstable, to be honest, but he's turning into quite the character.
[02:42:41.253 --> 02:42:42.034]  Let me just be honest.
[02:42:42.074 --> 02:42:44.196]  I'm far beyond CIA, Fox, okay?
[02:42:44.216 --> 02:42:45.176]  Let's just get that straight.
[02:42:45.897 --> 02:42:47.899]  I work for a much higher power than that.
[02:42:49.248 --> 02:42:54.371]  And it's called God, and I'm not saying I'm on some sacred mission, but I really believe everything I'm saying.
[02:42:54.671 --> 02:43:03.856]  I love humanity, and I'm getting spiritual directives, if you really want to get down to the, you know, in my gut, in my spirit.
[02:43:04.117 --> 02:43:07.178]  The media will run crazy with that, but no, I mean, I go with my conscience.
[02:43:07.899 --> 02:43:09.440]  And so I'm being directed by honor.
[02:43:10.260 --> 02:43:12.222]  Okay, I don't work for the CIA, folks.
[02:43:12.242 --> 02:43:14.203]  That's like working for Coca-Cola in Texas.
[02:43:14.704 --> 02:43:18.066]  Every third person is an asset of the CIA in this state.
[02:43:18.366 --> 02:43:20.308]  I'm literally swimming in CIA people.
[02:43:21.088 --> 02:43:26.873]  I mean, I am so sick of the movies, like it's, ooh, CIA, ooh, ooh, ooh!
[02:43:26.893 --> 02:43:28.634]  I mean, I'm so tired of it, Watson.
[02:43:28.654 --> 02:43:29.215]  What about you?
[02:43:29.235 --> 02:43:30.716]  Who do you really work for, Watson?
[02:43:32.037 --> 02:43:34.358]  Twelve-foot shapeshifting reptoids, obviously.
[02:43:35.119 --> 02:43:35.760]  I mean, who wouldn't?
[02:43:37.356 --> 02:43:44.823]  But the other thing is there's this allure to believe in really wild stuff that doesn't exist when there's so much good stuff we can prove.
[02:43:44.843 --> 02:43:50.648]  It's like there's still a lot of talk about this isn't the real site of the conference and that they're off meeting at some castle.
[02:43:50.988 --> 02:43:58.255]  You know, we've seen royalty arrive, we've seen NATO heads arrive, we've seen them right now out there drinking, talking, so we know they're here.
[02:43:58.909 --> 02:44:01.531]  Same speculation last year, but we saw them all coming in.
[02:44:01.631 --> 02:44:09.057]  Oh no, it's like the Washington Times gets from the Army the official document of preparation for war with drones against the American people for civil unrest.
[02:44:10.058 --> 02:44:13.201]  And no one cares, no one's covering it but drudge and info wars.
[02:44:13.881 --> 02:44:16.243]  And we have actual FEMA camp documents.
[02:44:16.684 --> 02:44:17.504]  No one cares.
[02:44:18.105 --> 02:44:24.750]  But if I go point something at a shed randomly and say that Easter bunnies live in it, everyone would just freak out and believe it.
[02:44:24.770 --> 02:44:25.571]  I don't understand it.
[02:44:27.739 --> 02:44:28.599]  What's the cop doing now?
[02:44:28.619 --> 02:44:29.280]  What's going on here?
[02:44:31.180 --> 02:44:36.442]  She's taping a sign onto a protester.
[02:44:37.062 --> 02:44:42.104]  The police are having some fun with the protesters.
[02:44:42.124 --> 02:44:43.645]  That's a community relations officer.
[02:44:43.665 --> 02:44:48.427]  She's getting them to mark themselves, literally like it's Nazi Germany, that you're a protester.
[02:44:48.447 --> 02:44:50.287]  But notice she's the sweet, charming one to do it.
[02:44:51.288 --> 02:44:51.828]  Literally.
[02:44:52.568 --> 02:44:53.909]  I don't think it's mandatory though.
[02:44:53.949 --> 02:44:55.089]  Oh, now she's hugging him.
[02:44:56.250 --> 02:44:56.950]  Oh my goodness.
[02:44:58.624 --> 02:45:00.065]  Get a hotel room, folks.
[02:45:03.426 --> 02:45:06.668]  Anyways... Public relations.
[02:45:07.168 --> 02:45:07.848]  Hey, go talk to her.
[02:45:07.928 --> 02:45:08.508]  Ask what it is.
[02:45:08.989 --> 02:45:10.209]  Ask what the pink stuff is.
[02:45:11.310 --> 02:45:13.551]  Ask her if you can pull it across your mouth.
[02:45:14.431 --> 02:45:15.291]  What's going on here?
[02:45:15.351 --> 02:45:16.372]  What are you doing?
[02:45:16.392 --> 02:45:17.812]  This is peace, love and harmony.
[02:45:18.133 --> 02:45:18.493]  Okay.
[02:45:18.593 --> 02:45:20.214]  Right?
[02:45:20.394 --> 02:45:21.114]  Love for everyone.
[02:45:21.821 --> 02:45:25.844]  Love from the police for everyone.
[02:45:26.644 --> 02:45:27.064]  I love you.
[02:45:29.926 --> 02:45:31.987]  Tagging them with love stickers, Alex.
[02:45:32.367 --> 02:45:34.269]  This is a very effective psy-op.
[02:45:34.309 --> 02:45:35.870]  Because this woman means well.
[02:45:36.210 --> 02:45:38.351]  You pick a salesman that believes in what they're selling.
[02:45:39.091 --> 02:45:41.153]  And they did this in England as well.
[02:45:41.193 --> 02:45:43.674]  And the cops actually were on our side and did follow the show.
[02:45:43.914 --> 02:45:45.956]  So it's real as well, but still...
[02:45:48.556 --> 02:45:50.196]  Still, they're being marked, folks.
[02:45:50.817 --> 02:45:54.058]  And there's a PSYOP above this that I bet this cop isn't even aware of.
[02:45:54.078 --> 02:45:55.679]  Do you agree with what I just said?
[02:45:57.380 --> 02:46:05.083]  I don't know, I don't really know what's going on with this, but they were filming us earlier when we were outside the other area after we initially filmed the Bilderberg members.
[02:46:05.123 --> 02:46:08.845]  Paul, ask her for one and stick it across your mouth to end the transmission.
[02:46:09.125 --> 02:46:09.926]  Sorry, Paul, what were you saying?
[02:46:10.626 --> 02:46:11.806]  I don't know where they've been, you know.
[02:46:12.167 --> 02:46:12.907]  I'll avoid that.
[02:46:13.427 --> 02:46:14.788]  No, no, you want a sticker.
[02:46:17.302 --> 02:46:18.702]  Oh, I don't want to ruin my shirt.
[02:46:19.222 --> 02:46:20.143]  It's an expensive shirt.
[02:46:22.923 --> 02:46:23.823]  Oh my goodness.
[02:46:25.244 --> 02:46:27.084]  I'll refrain from that, Alex, if it's alright.
[02:46:28.084 --> 02:46:29.545]  Alright, can we just have it then?
[02:46:30.405 --> 02:46:31.145]  Can we have one?
[02:46:31.165 --> 02:46:33.285]  Yeah, we'll get one.
[02:46:33.465 --> 02:46:34.906]  This is my crew, they don't do anything I tell them.
[02:46:34.926 --> 02:46:35.766]  Look at this spoiledness.
[02:46:37.626 --> 02:46:38.126]  Oh, Watson.
[02:46:39.727 --> 02:46:40.987]  Get David to go and get one.
[02:46:43.448 --> 02:46:44.048]  Okay, fine.
[02:46:44.868 --> 02:46:45.468]  You don't want to...
[02:46:46.863 --> 02:46:48.144]  Oh my gosh, what's going on here?
[02:46:49.085 --> 02:46:51.006]  That cop looks like she's having a little too good of a time.
[02:46:51.026 --> 02:46:52.347]  It is evening.
[02:46:52.787 --> 02:46:54.088]  She's on Alex, I'm telling you.
[02:46:55.569 --> 02:46:58.031]  Alright, I gotta stop it.
[02:46:58.371 --> 02:46:59.372]  I gotta stop it right now.
[02:46:59.392 --> 02:47:00.993]  If you're not watching this, it's ridiculous.
[02:47:01.794 --> 02:47:03.775]  Yeah, I think something's going on over here with that cop.
[02:47:04.476 --> 02:47:05.136]  That's what I think.
[02:47:05.156 --> 02:47:08.318]  This is a crazy world.
[02:47:08.438 --> 02:47:10.260]  It's not just somebody who's dressed up as a cop.
[02:47:11.161 --> 02:47:12.122]  That's a cop, alright.
[02:47:12.882 --> 02:47:14.703]  Anyways, you see the other cops laughing at her?
[02:47:15.323 --> 02:47:16.003]  Alright, anyways.
[02:47:16.744 --> 02:47:18.144]  And then, is that that reporter?
[02:47:18.184 --> 02:47:18.725]  What's her name?
[02:47:20.045 --> 02:47:20.646]  Who's that, Alex?
[02:47:21.086 --> 02:47:22.306]  Yeah, yeah, we got a better Skype connection.
[02:47:22.326 --> 02:47:23.347]  Let me talk to her real quick.
[02:47:24.567 --> 02:47:26.388]  Hey, I didn't know we featured some of her stuff.
[02:47:26.528 --> 02:47:27.789]  I actually know who she is.
[02:47:28.109 --> 02:47:29.930]  The video was so blurred, I had to figure out who she was.
[02:47:30.810 --> 02:47:31.331]  That's exciting.
[02:47:31.351 --> 02:47:31.991]  Tell her good job.
[02:47:33.252 --> 02:47:34.072]  Yeah, she can hear you now.
[02:47:34.898 --> 02:47:35.238]  Hi Alex.
[02:47:35.939 --> 02:47:42.124]  Hey, anyways, I didn't know that I was direct... I wanted to get footage of the world leaders, not send you guys away from them.
[02:47:42.405 --> 02:47:43.606]  How many of them are out there now?
[02:47:45.307 --> 02:47:46.488]  Outside on the patio?
[02:47:46.689 --> 02:47:48.310]  Yeah.
[02:47:48.490 --> 02:47:58.119]  I would say about 20, maybe 15 right beside the exit and then maybe another 10 like on the walkway, on the broadwalk.
[02:47:58.871 --> 02:48:06.357]  Alright, I'm gonna take some phone calls, but it'd be great if you guys would go over there and get some more footage of that, and then maybe, uh, I got a few words to say to him.
[02:48:06.377 --> 02:48:08.059]  Maybe you can translate it over and yell it at him.
[02:48:09.440 --> 02:48:09.780]  Okay.
[02:48:10.300 --> 02:48:11.882]  Alright, Watson, go back over there for me, bro.
[02:48:12.843 --> 02:48:13.243]  Alright, okay.
[02:48:13.363 --> 02:48:13.763]  Thank you, Paul.
[02:48:13.963 --> 02:48:15.365]  Let's go to some phone calls right now.
[02:48:15.405 --> 02:48:17.106]  I shouldn't screw around with my crew, I apologize.
[02:48:17.126 --> 02:48:24.692]  Uh, let's talk to Eric, uh, in, uh, FEMA Region 7, formerly in the U.S.
[02:48:25.133 --> 02:48:27.435]  Let's talk about the head of the CFR, Richard Haas.
[02:48:27.475 --> 02:48:27.775]  Go ahead.
[02:48:32.577 --> 02:48:33.878]  Hi Eric, how are you doing today?
[02:48:34.919 --> 02:48:37.681]  Uh, video, uh, Richard Haas?
[02:48:37.721 --> 02:48:37.801]  Yes.
[02:48:38.281 --> 02:48:42.084]  It's called, it's called Richard Haas explains that the U.S.
[02:48:42.184 --> 02:48:45.486]  Near East Strategy is the worst of all foreign policies.
[02:48:48.168 --> 02:48:52.091]  Yeah, I know, I mean, the CFR has a lot of different ideas in it, but what's your take on that?
[02:48:53.352 --> 02:48:57.334]  Well, um, because I want to make sure I was quick, because I know you got other calls.
[02:48:57.735 --> 02:49:02.238]  I basically said, is it an analogy to, uh, the Arab Spring, to the Bolshevik Revolution?
[02:49:05.836 --> 02:49:07.518]  You're talking about the Arab Spring?
[02:49:07.538 --> 02:49:09.159]  I'm sorry, I'm not making everything you're saying.
[02:49:13.183 --> 02:49:21.111]  Well, I mean, his point, his point is good if I take it that a lot of these Arab Springs and the stuff in Europe as well run by Soros, I mean, he admits that.
[02:49:22.510 --> 02:49:22.851]  Is that me?
[02:49:45.054 --> 02:49:45.714]  Yes, it is.
[02:49:45.754 --> 02:49:46.234]  Thank you.
[02:49:46.814 --> 02:49:47.895]  Good talking with you, Alex.
[02:49:49.335 --> 02:50:11.819]  Actually, just wanted to make a couple of points about the Bilderberg thing and actually the outbreaks that have been happening in Africa with the disease and that, but with the Bilderberg thing, how is it that, you know, they can walk around with just like armfuls of, you know, obvious documents that, you know,
[02:50:13.776 --> 02:50:15.400]  They should be somewhere else.
[02:50:18.579 --> 02:50:24.041]  Have a law force go in there and acquire those?
[02:50:24.061 --> 02:50:26.842]  Well, look, the point is they're not just hearing presentations.
[02:50:27.682 --> 02:50:29.323]  They're being given handouts.
[02:50:29.623 --> 02:50:31.023]  They're doing corporate meetings.
[02:50:31.944 --> 02:50:37.886]  It's an illegal, governmental, corporate, global governance boardroom meeting.
[02:50:38.346 --> 02:50:39.706]  They founded the Euro.
[02:50:39.786 --> 02:50:40.727]  That's in the BBC.
[02:50:40.767 --> 02:50:41.267]  They admit it.
[02:50:41.747 --> 02:50:43.548]  They're making big decisions.
[02:50:44.188 --> 02:50:45.408]  We're skipping this network break.
[02:50:45.448 --> 02:50:45.788]  I hear you.
[02:50:45.808 --> 02:50:46.949]  I appreciate that call, Joseph.
[02:50:48.052 --> 02:50:54.074]  Nick in California listening on KOMY 1340 in Santa Cruz.
[02:50:54.494 --> 02:50:55.394]  You're on the air, Nick.
[02:50:56.695 --> 02:51:01.056]  Hey, two years ago you got a call from Canada while you're on your road trip to Bilderberg.
[02:51:01.516 --> 02:51:06.358]  He's mentioning ice, chemical ice, these things, and he's called it bias.
[02:51:06.758 --> 02:51:09.139]  I got a report this year that they're doing chemical ice in the U.S.
[02:51:09.439 --> 02:51:12.360]  But last year they were going, hi Alex, hi Alex, you were overseas.
[02:51:12.927 --> 02:51:14.008]  Yes, I appreciate your call.
[02:51:14.028 --> 02:51:20.114]  Some of what these callers are bringing up is so esoteric that no one will understand it, because they're remembering something from a radio show eight years ago.
[02:51:32.970 --> 02:51:34.331]  Or a radio show six years ago.
[02:51:34.791 --> 02:51:44.097]  That yes, a lot of times when I go to Bilderberg, the day it ends, I get death threats, or my family does, and they tell you what you're talking about on the phone, to freak you out.
[02:51:45.457 --> 02:51:48.319]  Or, you know, they say, I hope your mom or dad dies in the hospital.
[02:51:48.699 --> 02:51:50.781]  I mean, but they do that too, not just at Bilderberg.
[02:51:50.821 --> 02:51:52.301]  It's just that's happened twice with Bilderberg.
[02:51:53.142 --> 02:51:53.842]  Maybe three times.
[02:51:55.003 --> 02:51:59.546]  You'll have a family member that's sick, or something bad happening, and then that's when the call comes in.
[02:51:59.886 --> 02:52:01.167]  So they're just sitting there waiting,
[02:52:02.162 --> 02:52:04.983]  You know, listening to what you're doing, and then they want to emotionally mess with you.
[02:52:05.003 --> 02:52:10.225]  Hey, I can be totally tired, have a headache, and somebody death threats me for real?
[02:52:10.905 --> 02:52:12.245]  You just gave me months of energy.
[02:52:12.786 --> 02:52:13.586]  I'm in a war.
[02:52:13.806 --> 02:52:15.606]  I expect they'll kill me someday.
[02:52:15.947 --> 02:52:17.207]  I'll expect they'll torture me.
[02:52:17.587 --> 02:52:18.707]  I'm not looking forward to it.
[02:52:18.787 --> 02:52:19.368]  I don't want it.
[02:52:19.428 --> 02:52:22.729]  But buddy, I'm in the game.
[02:52:24.109 --> 02:52:27.330]  Whatever it takes, I'll go as far as I have to.
[02:52:27.730 --> 02:52:28.731]  I'm beyond committed.
[02:52:29.778 --> 02:52:30.478]  And they don't like that.
[02:52:30.498 --> 02:52:31.899]  That's the one thing they're scared of, folks.
[02:52:32.239 --> 02:52:33.859]  You gotta just get committed against these people.
[02:52:33.899 --> 02:52:34.640]  I wanna say this again.
[02:52:35.900 --> 02:52:42.282]  So many people act like that I'm trying to scare people.
[02:52:43.303 --> 02:52:43.523]  No!
[02:52:43.943 --> 02:52:44.943]  I think you're like me.
[02:52:45.524 --> 02:52:47.084]  Illegitimate crooks are taking over?
[02:52:47.344 --> 02:52:48.885]  So what if they got power and weapons?
[02:52:49.385 --> 02:52:50.665]  They don't have moral high ground.
[02:52:51.046 --> 02:52:52.246]  We're gonna expose them.
[02:52:53.266 --> 02:52:56.948]  I'm not gonna just let them run my life and run me over because they're a bunch of killers and scum.
[02:52:58.081 --> 02:52:59.843]  I instinctively want to deal with them.
[02:53:00.984 --> 02:53:02.246]  Not because I'm a hero, folks.
[02:53:02.366 --> 02:53:03.087]  I want to live.
[02:53:03.147 --> 02:53:03.948]  I want to survive.
[02:53:04.288 --> 02:53:04.969]  I want to thrive.
[02:53:05.009 --> 02:53:06.851]  I have an instinct to have a good civilization.
[02:53:08.432 --> 02:53:09.734]  And I'm committed.
[02:53:10.375 --> 02:53:12.917]  And I'll use the analogy for the 500th time probably.
[02:53:14.980 --> 02:53:16.501]  World War II pilots, folks.
[02:53:17.802 --> 02:53:19.043]  They flew into the flak.
[02:53:19.123 --> 02:53:26.546]  It wasn't like, you know there's guns out there that fire artillery that explodes with flak that goes into your engines and goes through your windows and kills you.
[02:53:27.226 --> 02:53:30.867]  You know, moving 800 miles an hour, on average, flak once it detonates.
[02:53:33.288 --> 02:53:35.189]  You know, you know, you know you could die.
[02:53:39.491 --> 02:53:43.312]  Oh, look, you know, you, we could get you when you fly over our city.
[02:53:43.692 --> 02:53:46.654]  We're gonna be, yes, I know, yes, yes, yes.
[02:53:48.444 --> 02:53:49.806]  So call in death threat all you want.
[02:53:50.307 --> 02:53:51.869]  Pull out the stops, dirty tricks, whatever.
[02:53:52.169 --> 02:53:55.434]  I don't want it to happen, but I'm at a certain level due.
[02:53:55.454 --> 02:53:57.416]  Because that's how I get through any fears I had.
[02:53:57.677 --> 02:53:58.578]  Whatever, it's already done.
[02:53:58.598 --> 02:53:59.740]  You've already killed me in my mind.
[02:54:00.580 --> 02:54:01.480]  I'm beyond your grasp.
[02:54:01.500 --> 02:54:02.101]  You understand that?
[02:54:02.781 --> 02:54:08.222]  You could even get me, torture me, and turn me into a mind-numb zombie down the road and say you defeated Alex Jones.
[02:54:08.262 --> 02:54:08.663]  No, you didn't.
[02:54:09.143 --> 02:54:15.765]  Understand the Zen belief, which I do buy into, because it's prima facie true, that I did this in the time-space continuum.
[02:54:15.825 --> 02:54:16.445]  It lives forever.
[02:54:17.425 --> 02:54:17.906]  It happened.
[02:54:18.626 --> 02:54:19.486]  I am free now.
[02:54:19.606 --> 02:54:20.226]  This is me.
[02:54:20.526 --> 02:54:21.467]  I made these decisions.
[02:54:21.607 --> 02:54:22.127]  I'm committed.
[02:54:22.387 --> 02:54:24.708]  If I'm defeated, I win, because I fought back.
[02:54:25.028 --> 02:54:25.468]  I win.
[02:54:25.728 --> 02:54:26.368]  You lose.
[02:54:26.688 --> 02:54:27.229]  You're evil.
[02:54:27.509 --> 02:54:27.889]  I'm not.
[02:54:28.809 --> 02:54:29.470]  I love life.
[02:54:30.230 --> 02:54:31.551]  You decided to be failures.
[02:54:32.852 --> 02:54:33.432]  It's that simple.
[02:54:33.933 --> 02:54:35.354]  It's the Animated Contest of Liberty.
[02:54:36.610 --> 02:54:38.392]  It is the journey, not the destination.
[02:54:38.452 --> 02:54:40.293]  It's about making the right decisions in this life.
[02:54:40.534 --> 02:54:44.758]  Real quick, we've got a Polish journalist who got some interesting photos, and we're going to talk to them real fast.
[02:54:44.778 --> 02:54:47.060]  Then we're going to get some footage in of the Globalist.
[02:54:47.080 --> 02:54:48.221]  That's the number one thing I want.
[02:54:48.521 --> 02:54:53.005]  And then we're going to take some more phone calls from Michael and Toby and Sean and Mike and Clay.
[02:54:53.085 --> 02:54:59.391]  So, wake up callers, because I know when I sit them on hold for 30 minutes, they sound like they've been drinking corn syrup, or not corn syrup, cough syrup.
[02:54:59.951 --> 02:55:01.353]  Paul Watson, let's talk to this fellow.
[02:55:02.973 --> 02:55:08.900]  Yeah, this is a journalist who witnessed something very interesting with the Mayor of Atlanta, so tell us your name, tell us what you saw.
[02:55:09.361 --> 02:55:11.504]  Yeah, my name is Jan, I'm from Poland.
[02:55:12.124 --> 02:55:22.297]  I work for PrisonPlanet.pl and today I came to Denmark to see the gathering, Bilderberg Group.
[02:55:23.455 --> 02:55:30.120]  And for all day I just make shots from the bridge nearby hotel.
[02:55:31.100 --> 02:55:34.082]  And I saw the mayor of Atlanta.
[02:55:34.282 --> 02:55:35.843]  Here we have some shots of him.
[02:55:36.584 --> 02:55:42.247]  And lots of shots of the guy who spent the time in the garden behind the hotel.
[02:55:43.708 --> 02:55:44.289]  What did he say?
[02:55:44.329 --> 02:55:46.230]  Did you have any kind of interaction with him?
[02:55:47.551 --> 02:55:52.334]  No, he was chit-chatting with some other people in the garden.
[02:55:53.391 --> 02:56:03.193]  Behind yeah, and I just I was far far behind like hundred meter from from him So I just tell him fantastic if he says the photos will post them.
[02:56:03.213 --> 02:56:03.573]  Thank you.
[02:56:04.013 --> 02:56:06.093]  All right, Paul I'm gonna take some more calls in overdrive.
[02:56:06.493 --> 02:56:09.414]  I'd like you to get over there Please I want to see and with our camera.
[02:56:09.954 --> 02:56:12.094]  I know we've got high-def that you're gonna upload So what's the point?
[02:56:12.134 --> 02:56:15.515]  Well TV viewers and radio listeners want to hear the description of this or see it.
[02:56:15.915 --> 02:56:21.436]  Thank you so much briefly Don't forget we will sell out a super female vitality in the next
[02:56:23.089 --> 02:56:24.571]  Week max, probably the next few days.
[02:56:24.651 --> 02:56:26.513]  If you want to get it, get it.
[02:56:26.833 --> 02:56:32.459]  The male stuff works on females from the feedback we've gotten really well, but not like the female vitality.
[02:56:34.181 --> 02:56:36.923]  It's got two other herbs and a different combination of the other eight.
[02:56:37.264 --> 02:56:38.084]  It's going to sell out.
[02:56:38.204 --> 02:56:41.327]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[02:56:42.047 --> 02:56:43.909]  It'll probably sell out in the next week as well.
[02:56:44.569 --> 02:56:51.335]  We've got more of it, but it's the new X2 with the multi-million-year-old purple crystal iodine.
[02:56:51.375 --> 02:56:52.336]  Nobody else has got it.
[02:56:52.396 --> 02:56:53.497]  It's true nascent iodine.
[02:56:55.057 --> 02:56:58.562]  Actually, it's even better than the survival shield that's proprietary we have.
[02:56:58.622 --> 02:56:59.103]  It's excellent.
[02:56:59.763 --> 02:57:01.305]  I think this is probably too strong for kids.
[02:57:01.325 --> 02:57:02.207]  Consult your physician.
[02:57:02.247 --> 02:57:05.571]  So I would use the regular, you know, it's good to have both.
[02:57:05.631 --> 02:57:08.255]  This is just almost as twice as strong and
[02:57:10.117 --> 02:57:15.321]  A form of iodine nobody else has and it's just incredible for what it's done for me and my body and supercharging.
[02:57:15.361 --> 02:57:16.662]  The iodine conspiracy is amazing.
[02:57:17.063 --> 02:57:18.564]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:57:18.944 --> 02:57:22.667]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:57:22.687 --> 02:57:25.710]  Don't forget the Sunday show coming up this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:57:25.730 --> 02:57:27.611]  We'll have all the big Bilderberg wrap-up coverage.
[02:57:27.631 --> 02:57:28.632]  4 to 6 p.m.
[02:57:28.672 --> 02:57:29.012]  Central.
[02:57:29.052 --> 02:57:31.314]  Tell friends and family there's a war on for the mind.
[02:57:31.414 --> 02:57:32.975]  You are the soldiers on the front line.
[02:57:33.656 --> 02:57:35.137]  Make no mistake, I mean it's really happening.
[02:57:35.157 --> 02:57:37.079]  You're battling the New World Order whether you want to admit
[02:57:37.739 --> 02:57:39.643]  That's happening or not, you're in an epic struggle.
[02:57:40.365 --> 02:57:42.449]  Michael in Oregon, thanks for calling, you're on the air.
[02:57:43.652 --> 02:57:49.195]  Hey Alex, I just want you to know, yesterday I called Ron Wyden and I called Greg Walden.
[02:57:49.355 --> 02:58:01.922]  Ron Wyden's my Senator here, and Greg Walden is the only Republican that we have in Oregon, and I told them both, I said, listen, you know, the Logan Act, you know, it's a violation of law to meet in this capacity, and I want you guys to investigate it.
[02:58:02.243 --> 02:58:08.446]  You have a duty to do it, and I'm getting kicked off that you guys won't even do anything, and I get the same response all the time.
[02:58:08.506 --> 02:58:10.507]  Well, I'll pass the message on to the Senator.
[02:58:10.527 --> 02:58:11.748]  It's like, well, it's not a message.
[02:58:12.475 --> 02:58:18.438]  It's a request for action because you have a responsibility under federal law to do something.
[02:58:18.478 --> 02:58:19.239]  I mean, what is it?
[02:58:19.299 --> 02:58:20.159]  What do we have to do?
[02:58:20.179 --> 02:58:29.284]  I mean, I'm a software engineer and I sit at home and I code all day, but I'm getting tired of these blatant... I agree, but if you call the FBI, it's run by, uh...
[02:58:29.904 --> 02:58:31.725]  You know, the Justice Department, total criminals.
[02:58:32.365 --> 02:58:37.846]  If you call... I mean, the police don't like it in England, but they're not... It's compartmentalization.
[02:58:37.946 --> 02:58:39.347]  Great point, great caller.
[02:58:39.687 --> 02:58:40.307]  Michael, great.
[02:58:40.447 --> 02:58:41.087]  Thank you so much.
[02:58:41.527 --> 02:58:46.368]  Mike, Clay, and Toby, final caller straight ahead in Overdrive this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., folks.
[02:58:47.549 --> 02:58:55.291]  The video feed continues on at InfoWars.com forward slash show or at the Bilderberg icon, the all-seeing eye on InfoWars.
[02:58:56.724 --> 02:59:00.687]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:59:00.727 --> 02:59:04.851]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:59:05.091 --> 02:59:08.514]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:59:08.774 --> 02:59:11.656]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:59:11.817 --> 02:59:19.183]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:59:19.383 --> 02:59:23.026]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:59:23.206 --> 02:59:27.527]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:59:27.687 --> 02:59:33.629]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:59:33.669 --> 02:59:37.450]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:59:37.610 --> 02:59:40.151]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:59:40.351 --> 02:59:41.692]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:59:41.852 --> 02:59:43.092]  It's time to take action.
[02:59:43.232 --> 02:59:44.933]  It's time to filter our water.
[02:59:45.033 --> 02:59:52.175]  Visit Infowarsstore.com and use promo code WATER to get 10% off their entire family of incredible products.
[02:59:52.615 --> 02:59:55.977]  Our call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:59:57.518 --> 02:59:58.679]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:59.059 --> 03:00:00.360]  Direct from Austin.
[03:00:01.100 --> 03:00:04.302]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:11.482 --> 03:00:15.644]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:16.324 --> 03:00:17.104]  You want answers?
[03:00:17.904 --> 03:00:18.785]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:19.445 --> 03:00:23.106]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:23.646 --> 03:00:27.688]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:44.622 --> 03:00:51.771]  Alright folks, the Bilderberg creeps have snuck back into the building, but we got Paul Watson and others, activist journalists out there on the street.
[03:00:51.811 --> 03:00:52.792]  I'm going to take a few final calls.
[03:00:53.253 --> 03:00:54.955]  Paul, I know you'll have more on the Nightly News tonight.
[03:00:54.995 --> 03:00:55.956]  Seven, great job.
[03:00:55.976 --> 03:00:57.337]  I know it's already evening time over there.
[03:00:57.778 --> 03:00:59.039]  Go take a break, but you know...
[03:00:59.780 --> 03:01:01.901]  Saturday and Sunday is when we'll get another media push.
[03:01:01.982 --> 03:01:08.165]  Friday's not the best day to put news out, but we've got to get into the fact that they're violating laws and a certain policy.
[03:01:08.285 --> 03:01:09.246]  We need articles on that.
[03:01:09.266 --> 03:01:12.528]  We need a Masher article with the best photos and videos all together.
[03:01:12.568 --> 03:01:22.074]  I know my crew's doing that here, but just round of applause for the whole InfoWars team and Karen Knight and David Knight, husband and wife team, and Josh Owens.
[03:01:22.354 --> 03:01:23.175]  Fabulous job.
[03:01:23.235 --> 03:01:23.935]  Any other points?
[03:01:24.836 --> 03:01:26.677]  Any other points from your friend there, the Freulein?
[03:01:29.782 --> 03:01:34.287]  Yeah, I guess I'll end with, you know, they're not in there deciding our future.
[03:01:34.307 --> 03:01:36.089]  They're deciding their future.
[03:01:36.129 --> 03:01:37.631]  That's what they're interested in.
[03:01:38.812 --> 03:01:42.236]  And of course that affects our future, but I just want to make that distinction.
[03:01:42.256 --> 03:01:45.220]  That's what I believe is going on in there.
[03:01:46.994 --> 03:01:47.955]  No, I tend to agree with you.
[03:01:47.975 --> 03:01:48.695]  That's a good point.
[03:01:49.115 --> 03:01:56.220]  And again, if we can just point the camera over at the area where they're normally at, so people watching this in Denmark who are going to be protesting tomorrow know where to go.
[03:01:57.121 --> 03:02:03.645]  And I guess you've got a telephoto lens because, I mean... No, I understand they're in that building, but where is it where they're having the cocktails and smoking the cigars?
[03:02:04.585 --> 03:02:05.185]  I saw champagne.
[03:02:05.205 --> 03:02:05.786]  I saw champagne.
[03:02:05.806 --> 03:02:06.726]  It's actually pretty good.
[03:02:25.026 --> 03:02:29.570]  Liquid headache in a bottle.
[03:02:29.590 --> 03:02:34.274]  I walked by there, it's an open kind of boardwalk for, it's the public.
[03:02:34.614 --> 03:02:39.678]  And you can walk and there's like a playground, people are jumping off into the water and like sunbathing and stuff.
[03:02:40.139 --> 03:02:44.102]  And it's interesting how they're just allowed to block all that off even though it's a pedestrian area.
[03:02:44.883 --> 03:02:48.386]  So Henry Kissinger's out there just bashing like a dead whale?
[03:02:49.212 --> 03:03:00.979]  Yeah, I think we got Kissinger as well, we just got the back of his head, but if you look at the picture which is on the Infowars story of Wolfensohn and Etienne D'Avignon, they're both smoking a pipe, they look completely smug.
[03:03:01.459 --> 03:03:03.900]  I think that's quite an icon.
[03:03:03.920 --> 03:03:06.942]  Well they do run the planet to a great extent, why not be smug?
[03:03:07.142 --> 03:03:10.344]  And again, Kissinger does go out in a dress sometimes, I'm not kidding.
[03:03:10.905 --> 03:03:16.728]  So if you see like a really horrific looking old woman, like a troll dressed up in a pink dress, that may be him meeting somebody.
[03:03:19.031 --> 03:03:21.712]  It may be, but David Rockefeller's not here this year, is he?
[03:03:21.873 --> 03:03:24.954]  Oh, David's always attended until now.
[03:03:24.974 --> 03:03:26.535]  That means he must be near death.
[03:03:28.196 --> 03:03:29.076]  Well, you would imagine.
[03:03:29.096 --> 03:03:30.877]  I mean, come on, been waiting so long.
[03:03:30.897 --> 03:03:31.617]  What is he, 87, 88?
[03:03:34.252 --> 03:03:36.033]  He's in his 90s, isn't he, Rockefeller?
[03:03:36.133 --> 03:03:37.593]  Yeah, yeah, none of them ever made it past 100.
[03:03:37.934 --> 03:03:38.714]  It's an ongoing bet.
[03:03:39.054 --> 03:03:41.975]  John Dee, the first, tried to make it to 100 and died a few months early.
[03:03:41.995 --> 03:03:43.496]  I mean, it's a big deal.
[03:03:43.556 --> 03:03:45.077]  He's trying to go to... He's 98.
[03:03:45.157 --> 03:03:45.517]  He's 98.
[03:03:46.697 --> 03:03:48.758]  Satan has the pit opening the portal.
[03:03:49.278 --> 03:03:50.939]  Ah, come to me, my baby.
[03:03:52.060 --> 03:03:53.940]  Alright, absolutely great.
[03:03:55.481 --> 03:03:57.742]  I hope they know we're ready for them when they come out.
[03:03:59.783 --> 03:04:01.884]  Where do you think he's going when he dies?
[03:04:03.987 --> 03:04:05.128]  Oh, purgatory.
[03:04:05.928 --> 03:04:07.009]  For a lot of questioning.
[03:04:07.489 --> 03:04:10.331]  He'll probably just come back as a zombie and nobody will know he's the difference.
[03:04:11.511 --> 03:04:14.713]  He probably actually gets sent to Santa Claus' workshop.
[03:04:14.733 --> 03:04:16.214]  He's gonna be a mushroom, Alex.
[03:04:17.434 --> 03:04:17.814]  Do what?
[03:04:18.535 --> 03:04:20.376]  He's gonna be a mushroom in his next life.
[03:04:21.289 --> 03:04:23.071]  Exactly, people will eat him and hallucinate.
[03:04:23.491 --> 03:04:24.592]  All right, listen, great job.
[03:04:24.632 --> 03:04:25.553]  I'm sorry to all the callers.
[03:04:25.613 --> 03:04:26.554]  Sunday, more calls.
[03:04:27.255 --> 03:04:28.416]  Whatever, Monday, everything.
[03:04:28.476 --> 03:04:29.316]  Great job, crew.
[03:04:29.557 --> 03:04:31.098]  You guys be safe, Watson and others.
[03:04:31.518 --> 03:04:31.819]  All right?
[03:04:31.879 --> 03:04:32.900]  And we salute you out there.
[03:04:33.160 --> 03:04:34.942]  Everybody's really rooting for you.
[03:04:36.363 --> 03:04:37.244]  All right, thanks, Alex.
[03:04:37.984 --> 03:04:40.286]  All right, there goes the Wasselhoff, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:04:41.107 --> 03:04:41.468]  All right.
[03:04:42.443 --> 03:04:43.144]  Sorry to the callers.
[03:04:43.164 --> 03:04:43.944]  I got to a lot of you, though.
[03:04:44.845 --> 03:04:46.086]  Great job of the crew, everybody.
[03:04:46.126 --> 03:04:47.347]  I keep saying great job, great job.
[03:04:47.707 --> 03:04:52.731]  It's very fulfilling to have our reporters out there to be breaking big news, to be forcing this out in the open.
[03:04:53.792 --> 03:04:56.053]  I feel like my team just won a Super Bowl again.
[03:04:56.994 --> 03:04:58.856]  And this is how we defeat them.
[03:04:59.536 --> 03:05:00.657]  And we build optimism.
[03:05:00.677 --> 03:05:01.618]  We're not pessimistic.
[03:05:02.358 --> 03:05:02.959]  We can win.
[03:05:03.499 --> 03:05:05.841]  See you back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., Nightly News Tonight.
[03:05:07.236 --> 03:05:08.037]  I don't know what it is.
[03:05:08.257 --> 03:05:09.938]  Ralph just won't pay any attention to me.
[03:05:10.119 --> 03:05:14.062]  When he comes home from work, all he ever does is play video games and go to sleep.
[03:05:14.242 --> 03:05:15.483]  It's like I don't even exist.
[03:05:15.824 --> 03:05:17.645]  Oh Betty, that's just awful.
[03:05:17.785 --> 03:05:19.006]  Does this seem familiar?
[03:05:19.167 --> 03:05:20.708]  If the answer to this question is yes,
