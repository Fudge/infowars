[00:00:11.604 --> 00:00:18.750]  I want to go to Clavin and Brian and Otamio and Robert and Robert and Gerald and Damien and Tim and Ryan.
[00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:29.739]  I will get to everybody, but tomorrow we're going to have Jakari Jackson and of course Joe Beggs, our reporters, who got hit with rubber bullets and tear gas and you name it a few months ago in Ferguson.
[00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.923]  They're going to be there awaiting the grand jury verdict on the Brown shooting case.
[00:00:35.623 --> 00:00:36.064]  And again,
[00:00:37.028 --> 00:00:44.997]  From what we've seen, a lot of evidence points towards the cop telling the truth, but the whole handling of it seems like a PSYOP, so very suspicious.
[00:00:45.017 --> 00:00:46.679]  We're going to get Jakari Jackson's take.
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.865]  We've also got their filed report on Infowars.com, where we're talking about
[00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:55.187]  A 300% increase in gun sales in the state.
[00:00:55.607 --> 00:00:57.668]  We've got those interviews with gun dealers, you name it.
[00:00:58.108 --> 00:01:01.790]  And Jakari's report, the call before the storm has gone viral as well.
[00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.653]  So Jakari, just give us a recap so far of what you see going on and what you think is going to happen.
[00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:09.473]  What's your gut tell you?
[00:01:10.305 --> 00:01:13.848]  Ja'Kari Jax reporting live just north of Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:01:13.868 --> 00:01:27.280]  Yeah, like you talked about in that report, Alex, we had a chance to go to West Florissant yesterday, walk the streets, and we saw gun, not so much gun owners, but we saw shop owners boarding up their windows, their establishments, and none of them really wanted to talk on camera.
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.782]  But they were telling us, yeah, we're very much concerned.
[00:01:29.802 --> 00:01:33.065]  You know, they think that that was exactly the calm before the storm.
[00:01:33.545 --> 00:01:35.045]  And so people were making preparation.
[00:01:35.065 --> 00:01:40.447]  We saw several buildings, even a lot of phone stores, you know, your T-Mobile stores, your Boost Mobile stores.
[00:01:40.747 --> 00:01:47.388]  They had their buildings completely boarded up in anticipation of this verdict coming down with Officer Wilson.
[00:01:47.788 --> 00:01:54.590]  And we had a chance, myself and Joe Biggs, we went to the liquor store today, where Mike Brown was, and we were looking around trying to see if we could get a feel for it.
[00:01:54.986 --> 00:02:05.414]  And a lot of the locals were telling us here that they didn't think Mike Brown had gone to that particular store or at least committed the crime that they said he did, uh, stealing the, uh, the cigarillos or whatever they were from behind the counter.
[00:02:05.874 --> 00:02:13.380]  And I looked around and I'm about 6'1", I don't know how big Mike was, but I'm about 6'1", and where they were placed in that particular store, it would have been difficult for me to grab.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.581]  Could somebody have done it?
[00:02:14.661 --> 00:02:16.762]  Yeah, but, you know, it takes somebody much larger than me.
[00:02:16.802 --> 00:02:19.184]  Like I said, I'm not exactly sure how big Mike was.
[00:02:19.564 --> 00:02:23.087]  But meanwhile... Well, what do they say about the video that they report to be him?
[00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.872]  Well, a lot of people were saying that that wasn't him.
[00:02:25.932 --> 00:02:35.580]  Now, to me, it looked like it was him, especially if you contrast that with the footage, or I guess the still images of Mike on the ground, I guess, a few minutes later after his encounter with Wilson.
[00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.504]  He does appear to be wearing the same clothing, does appear to be the same body type, same body proportions.
[00:02:40.844 --> 00:02:44.828]  So, I'll say, to me, it did look like Mike, although some people dispute that it was him.
[00:02:45.484 --> 00:02:45.884]  All right.
[00:02:46.685 --> 00:02:48.486]  Anything else that you think you should add?
[00:02:48.526 --> 00:02:51.508]  I mean, do we have a... I mean, they were saying maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow.
[00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:59.634]  What intel are you gathering on when the verdict may be from the grand jury on whether to indict the police officer?
[00:02:59.674 --> 00:03:01.856]  We've been hearing a whole lot that it's going to be tomorrow.
[00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:03.617]  Local news is teasing it.
[00:03:03.637 --> 00:03:10.142]  A lot of them don't want to come out and say definitive tomorrow, but a lot of people are speculating that it will be Monday when the verdict comes down.
[00:03:10.862 --> 00:03:18.251]  And we've also seen that a lot of churches are volunteering to care for school children because they anticipate the schools to be closed as well.
[00:03:18.271 --> 00:03:20.995]  So they're saying, hey, bring your kids over here to the church, to the rec center.
[00:03:21.235 --> 00:03:22.577]  We'll take care of them while you're at work.
[00:03:22.617 --> 00:03:26.181]  And hopefully, you know, the riots won't affect the churches, if the riots do happen.
[00:03:27.583 --> 00:03:29.105]  Anything else, Shikari, you want to add?
[00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.811]  No, we're here.
[00:03:30.831 --> 00:03:31.331]  We're ready.
[00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:32.232]  We got the gear.
[00:03:32.252 --> 00:03:33.794]  We got the Infidel body armor.
[00:03:33.814 --> 00:03:34.635]  Joe Biggs is here.
[00:03:35.636 --> 00:03:36.797]  We're going to be in the thick of it.
[00:03:37.117 --> 00:03:40.200]  If it does turn ugly, hopefully it doesn't.
[00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:42.663]  Everything was calm around the quick trip yesterday.
[00:03:42.683 --> 00:03:44.885]  No protests, no anything.
[00:03:44.905 --> 00:03:46.407]  So hopefully it remains that way.
[00:03:46.447 --> 00:03:49.290]  But if it does happen to hit the fan, we'll be here to document it.
[00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.792]  Infowars.com.
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.883]  That's right, right around that grocery store that got burned down.
[00:03:54.303 --> 00:03:56.466]  That seems to be the epicenter of the protesting.
[00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:59.008]  A lot of legitimate protesters, a lot of smart people out there.
[00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.952]  Some, you know, unsavory groups coming in to capitalize on it.
[00:04:02.972 --> 00:04:05.475]  But they're talking about riots in Chicago, other areas.
[00:04:06.536 --> 00:04:09.278]  I mean, I understand people's concern about a police state at the same time, though.
[00:04:09.298 --> 00:04:15.082]  I think it'll make the police state worse if people run around rioting, but if folks are angry, what could they do?
[00:04:15.122 --> 00:04:18.024]  Well, they could go vote, or they could file lawsuits.
[00:04:18.485 --> 00:04:24.309]  I mean, I don't like the fact that Ferguson's like 70% black, and what, there's two black police officers out of 50-something?
[00:04:24.329 --> 00:04:31.334]  I mean, there are some issues there, but running around just, you know, randomly getting mad, I don't think it's productive.
[00:04:31.374 --> 00:04:32.195]  Jakari, what do you think?
[00:04:32.853 --> 00:04:34.614]  No, that's exactly how I feel.
[00:04:34.694 --> 00:04:40.899]  You know, if you want to have a peaceful protest, go talk to your police chief, go talk to the prosecutor, whoever it may be.
[00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:44.241]  But burning down this neighborhood is not going to solve anything.
[00:04:44.502 --> 00:04:48.264]  But the thing about it is, a lot of these people coming to do this harm, they're not from here.
[00:04:48.304 --> 00:04:50.466]  You know, these guys, they come from Chicago, they come from wherever.
[00:04:50.786 --> 00:04:51.507]  We're good to go.
[00:05:12.304 --> 00:05:13.925]  That never grew up and never got a job.
[00:05:13.965 --> 00:05:14.705]  Thank you, Jakari.
[00:05:14.925 --> 00:05:18.947]  We're going to have you live tomorrow as all this unfolds and at night as the verdict comes out.
[00:05:18.987 --> 00:05:20.927]  And be safe in the middle of that.
[00:05:21.428 --> 00:05:25.169]  You guys, you know, do as much as you want, but be safe because you guys volunteered to go up there.
[00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:26.210]  We appreciate your courage.
[00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:33.873]  We're going to come back in a moment and talk to Joe Biggs after he jumps in front of the mic there in front of the camera in just a moment.
[00:05:33.893 --> 00:05:36.394]  Then we're going to come back and race through calls.
[00:05:36.474 --> 00:05:36.854]  Calvin?
[00:05:37.594 --> 00:05:42.235]  Let's talk about Ferguson and Brian and Tim and everybody else.
[00:05:42.595 --> 00:05:46.536]  We're going to get to Ryan and Tennessee, you name it, after this break.
[00:05:46.576 --> 00:05:48.477]  But we've got Joe Biggs now in front of the camera.
[00:05:48.817 --> 00:05:53.838]  Joe, give us your quick take as a reporter and as an analyst on what you think is going to happen.
[00:05:54.718 --> 00:06:06.281]  Well, honestly, I think all hell will break loose because we pretty much have a good feeling that, you know, Officer Wilson will not be charged with the murder of Mike Brown and he will be released.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:18.243]  The mayor of Ferguson has come out and said that if indeed he is cleared of all charges, he will be cleared to go back to work and work as a police officer on the beat out here on the streets.
[00:06:18.743 --> 00:06:27.585]  Now, I don't know if that decision is purely up to them or if Wilson has any say in that, but if I were him, I would not want to be seen in this area again whatsoever.
[00:06:27.605 --> 00:06:32.586]  You know, I use social media quite a bit to talk with the people in this area who
[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.742]  Uh, organized a lot of these protests.
[00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:41.526]  There was a protest today we tried to get to, but it started snowing so bad we weren't able to make it to because it was about 30 minutes south.
[00:06:41.587 --> 00:06:42.407]  Global warming.
[00:06:43.148 --> 00:06:44.949]  Yeah, Al Gore, like you said.
[00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:55.598]  But, uh, you know, uh, protesters were laying in the middle of the roads blocking a very ritzy neighborhood street and, uh, they had, uh, drawn chalk around them just like, you know, when someone dies on the road.
[00:06:55.918 --> 00:06:58.060]  And they were all laying in the roads protesting there.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.562]  Everyone says, the snow's not gonna stop us.
[00:07:00.602 --> 00:07:01.243]  We will come out.
[00:07:01.604 --> 00:07:04.305]  If you board up your windows, we'll just burn the building down.
[00:07:04.666 --> 00:07:13.150]  So everyone's very agitated about attacking this entire place and just, you know, riding and doing whatever, you know.
[00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.833]  What they're saying now is this is no longer, they're no longer considered protesters.
[00:07:18.273 --> 00:07:24.376]  They are considered people starting a revolution that they're hoping it'll spark a revolution across the U.S.
[00:07:24.697 --> 00:07:27.358]  where people in Atlanta, Chicago, and other places will stand up
[00:07:27.805 --> 00:07:54.874]  against the police state and their way of doing it is with violence and you know they're calling out you know when I went to the gun store and spoke to the owner yesterday you know he pulled me aside he said you know from what I see on Twitter and Facebook just you being white there's a good chance that you might get shot or something like that he was you know very concerned for you know our health and well-being and I could understand that but you know we're professionals we're gonna be out here we've done this we're gonna document it
[00:07:58.311 --> 00:07:59.152]  The facts are in.
[00:07:59.332 --> 00:08:00.452]  The studies are legion.
[00:08:00.733 --> 00:08:08.077]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:08:08.257 --> 00:08:11.719]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:12.520]  Simple.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.063]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:08:17.363 --> 00:08:20.585]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet.
[00:08:20.785 --> 00:08:22.827]  But we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:08:23.067 --> 00:08:28.452]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
[00:08:28.612 --> 00:08:39.121]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:08:39.421 --> 00:08:41.263]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[00:08:41.383 --> 00:08:44.545]  By the way, the Prime Minister of Canada got in Putin's face.
[00:08:44.625 --> 00:08:45.505]  And Putin left the G20.
[00:08:45.545 --> 00:08:47.106]  I mean, stuff's really escalating.
[00:09:10.495 --> 00:09:12.435]  I want to go to your calls here in just a moment.
[00:09:12.475 --> 00:09:16.476]  Finishing up, Joe Biggs reporting from nearby Ferguson.
[00:09:16.576 --> 00:09:17.056]  They're in St.
[00:09:17.096 --> 00:09:17.416]  Louis.
[00:09:18.796 --> 00:09:20.377]  They're now saying the verdict should be tomorrow.
[00:09:21.817 --> 00:09:24.277]  And they're reporting that all hell's probably going to break loose.
[00:09:24.477 --> 00:09:25.578]  That's what the police are saying.
[00:09:26.038 --> 00:09:32.239]  In fact, the social media is pretty much saying there'll be a riot regardless of whether the cop's indicted or not.
[00:09:33.059 --> 00:09:34.479]  That just sounds bizarre, Joe.
[00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:37.100]  Well, it's just like a sporting event.
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:37.880]  Say if the St.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.040]  Louis Cardinals were to win the World Series, people would
[00:09:40.305 --> 00:09:42.045]  Take to the streets, start flipping cars.
[00:09:42.065 --> 00:09:46.086]  It happens after Stanley Cups are won, you know, in a hockey game.
[00:09:46.486 --> 00:09:51.367]  So, you know, people riot when there's something positive and people riot when there's something negative.
[00:09:51.407 --> 00:09:56.269]  It's just a way for people to unleash that rage that they've had pent up all year.
[00:09:56.289 --> 00:10:02.670]  You know, I got some really good intel today that there are quite a bit of Homeland Security vehicles being spotted
[00:10:03.446 --> 00:10:07.049]  I'd say about 20-25 minutes out around the St.
[00:10:07.069 --> 00:10:07.609]  Louis area.
[00:10:07.629 --> 00:10:32.687]  There's a big block of the area and there was a Navy veteran Thursday who posted a picture on Facebook and he works at the Chesterfield Mall and or at the Drury Inn Mall in Chesterfield and what he did is he was driving through the parking lot to go to work and he saw tons and tons of DHS vehicles parked in there and so he took a picture and took some video and posted it to Facebook
[00:10:32.987 --> 00:10:36.029]  And said, why are all these Homeland Security officers here?
[00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:37.470]  Hashtag Ferguson.
[00:10:37.751 --> 00:10:41.293]  Well, he was called in Friday by his boss and told to take those down.
[00:10:41.653 --> 00:10:45.036]  Well, then my buddy runs a radio station here in St.
[00:10:45.076 --> 00:10:45.396]  Louis.
[00:10:46.337 --> 00:10:52.141]  He was called by this guy who was a Navy veteran and he was called this morning and he was told he was fired.
[00:10:52.461 --> 00:10:54.823]  The Department of Homeland Security saw those pictures.
[00:10:55.425 --> 00:11:04.111]  And the place where he works has also been fined as well for basically divulging secret information about where they're hiding.
[00:11:04.871 --> 00:11:06.452]  By the way, the press is allowed to do that.
[00:11:06.492 --> 00:11:07.853]  They shouldn't be intimidating folks.
[00:11:08.093 --> 00:11:11.776]  They shouldn't have let that guy go just because the feds told them to.
[00:11:12.056 --> 00:11:13.397]  But we see more and more of this.
[00:11:13.437 --> 00:11:15.078]  Joe, do a special report on that.
[00:11:15.438 --> 00:11:16.619]  Try to interview that guy.
[00:11:16.639 --> 00:11:18.240]  This is just outrageous.
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:18.880]  Great job.
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:20.081]  Any other intel?
[00:11:21.069 --> 00:11:24.070]  Well, like we said, it's a pretty good chance it's going to happen tomorrow.
[00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:30.552]  And the reason I say that is because on Friday, the schools told the parents, hey, we're going to give your child extra homework.
[00:11:30.832 --> 00:11:37.314]  That way, for Monday, when they don't come in, they can catch up on the work and be ready for Tuesday if things go back to normal.
[00:11:37.594 --> 00:11:39.875]  So with that being said, it looks like Monday.
[00:11:40.015 --> 00:11:48.698]  Also, some more mainstream media and news sources came into town today as well from out of town, you know, from New York and places like that for tomorrow.
[00:11:49.773 --> 00:11:57.560]  You know, give or take, tomorrow's going to happen at some point in time, and we're going to be out there at the courthouse as it happens, bringing you guys live, up-to-date coverage.
[00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:58.060]  So, stay tuned.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:58.400]  That's right.
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.962]  Tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[00:12:00.002 --> 00:12:01.283]  Central, and the Nightly News at 9.
[00:12:01.343 --> 00:12:02.944]  You're going to be there until the verdict.
[00:12:03.565 --> 00:12:04.606]  They're in Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:12:04.646 --> 00:12:05.727]  Great job, Joe and Jakari.
