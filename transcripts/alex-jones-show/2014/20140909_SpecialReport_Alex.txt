[00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:17.548]  The World Health Organization, the very same organization that wants to impose a global consumer tax on everything from internet use to your bank account to raise money for its drug research in the developing world, is reporting total Ebola-fueled chaos in West Africa.
[00:00:17.848 --> 00:00:29.658]  Scientists have discovered that this new unique strain of Ebola may have originated during a funeral for a traditional healer in Sierra Leone, where two strains of Ebola may have coincided.
[00:00:30.058 --> 00:00:37.444]  Further research has traced the disease down to a two-year-old boy that contracted the virus from a wild animal.
[00:00:37.744 --> 00:00:40.827]  The pandemic is ravaging Liberia the hardest.
[00:00:41.147 --> 00:00:47.774]  Where entire families are packing themselves into taxis in a futile attempt to find Ebola care.
[00:00:48.094 --> 00:00:57.083]  The Ebola laden taxis will only add fuel to the fire as they are not disinfected and beds are in short supply to treat this contagion.
[00:00:57.483 --> 00:01:01.404]  Nearly 40% of new cases have occurred in the past three weeks.
[00:01:01.805 --> 00:01:12.768]  According to the World Health Organization, 3,600 have been infected with Ebola, 2,000 have died, and upwards of 20,000 will become victims of the outbreak before it's all over.
[00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:16.870]  But those numbers have been disputed by locals in West Africa for months.
[00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:27.015]  Last month, Dr. Gottlieb, former Director of Medical Policy Development for the Food and Drug Administration, asserted that Ebola is likely to arrive in the U.S.
[00:01:27.555 --> 00:01:33.839]  and that if it does, the CDC will invoke powers to hold a healthy person against their will.
[00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.961]  Dr. Gottlieb also points at an executive order passed by Obama on July 31st
[00:01:40.282 --> 00:01:45.929]  Which allows for the detention of Americans who merely display signs of any respiratory illness.
[00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.997]  We are already seeing widespread respiratory mystery illness among children in the United States.
[00:01:52.438 --> 00:01:53.800]  It's only a matter of time.
