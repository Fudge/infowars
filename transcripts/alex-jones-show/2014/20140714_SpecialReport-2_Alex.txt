[00:00:13.237 --> 00:00:19.920]  This past Wednesday, a Catholic priest told amnesty supporters in Marietta, California that we should open our arms to illegal immigrants.
[00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:22.862]  And it would appear that churches in this region are doing just that.
[00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:23.682]  And what's your name, sir?
[00:00:24.043 --> 00:00:24.603]  John Andrews.
[00:00:25.223 --> 00:00:25.864]  And what do you do here?
[00:00:26.244 --> 00:00:33.527]  I'm the Director of Communications for the Diocese of San Bernardino, which is all of the Catholic churches in San Bernardino and Riverside counties here in Southern California.
[00:00:34.228 --> 00:00:37.990]  And I was told this is where illegal immigrant children are being sheltered, correct?
[00:00:38.717 --> 00:00:49.686]  We received 46 women and children yesterday into this church that have come from Central American countries having requested political asylum here.
[00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:58.733]  They came to us with paperwork of legal authorization to be in the United States pending a court hearing for their asylum claim.
[00:00:58.853 --> 00:00:59.433]  Who brought them here?
[00:01:00.374 --> 00:01:01.815]  The Department of Homeland Security.
[00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:04.257]  Okay, so were they brought in here by bus?
[00:01:04.844 --> 00:01:05.346]  That is correct.
[00:01:05.646 --> 00:01:12.647]  We had one group that came yesterday and that's all that we've had and we have no word at this time that we're going to receive any more.
[00:01:13.257 --> 00:01:14.297]  And what about the logistics?
[00:01:14.337 --> 00:01:18.339]  Are you having to bring in more food and facilities, things of that nature?
[00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:25.822]  We've had people come forward with very generous donations of food, offering to cook food here, clothing that's needed.
[00:01:25.882 --> 00:01:32.525]  We wanted to see how things went with this first group and to get a gauge on what their needs were and we were able to do that pretty well.
[00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:36.126]  Has any churches in the area have also been providing shelters?
[00:01:36.507 --> 00:01:39.928]  This is the only Catholic church in the diocese that has done this thus far.
[00:01:40.188 --> 00:01:41.128]  How did this come to be?
[00:01:41.168 --> 00:01:43.449]  Did Homeland Security come and talk to you about this?
[00:01:43.469 --> 00:02:01.614]  We did have a meeting with the federal authorities because we wanted to know how we might be of assistance in this crisis and out of that meeting came the idea that we would provide this kind of very temporary transitional center and that's how it came to be.
[00:02:02.193 --> 00:02:04.515]  And how long do you think the immigrants will stay here?
[00:02:05.116 --> 00:02:06.257]  Well, most of them are already gone.
[00:02:07.818 --> 00:02:09.940]  About 30 left within the same day.
[00:02:10.361 --> 00:02:14.725]  We still have three families here and they have their tickets and they'll be leaving today.
[00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:16.647]  Tickets, so how are they leaving?
[00:02:17.468 --> 00:02:18.749]  How are they leaving this area?
[00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:19.430]  By bus.
[00:02:20.917 --> 00:02:21.618]  Who's busing them?
[00:02:21.658 --> 00:02:24.959]  Is it the Department of Homeland Security or some other outfit?
[00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:34.922]  No, the federal authorities have basically given these folks to us and asked us to kind of take it from here in terms of connecting them with their families.
[00:02:34.942 --> 00:02:41.444]  They're taking Greyhound buses at their expense to be with those who they've come to unite with in the United States.
[00:02:41.988 --> 00:02:44.670]  So who's coordinating the takeover of the bus station?
[00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:45.791]  We are.
[00:02:46.431 --> 00:02:49.894]  So is Homeland Security buying them tickets, vouchers?
[00:02:50.454 --> 00:02:51.055]  Absolutely not.
[00:02:51.655 --> 00:02:53.156]  There's no federal money coming for this.
[00:02:53.897 --> 00:02:57.379]  We're doing this and we feel called by our faith to do this.
[00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:06.586]  We understand that they have received health screenings and we're prepared to do that on a secondary basis too.
[00:03:06.626 --> 00:03:07.527]  We're looking at that.
[00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:10.149]  Do you have any plan of action in case there's an outbreak?
[00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:11.550]  An outbreak?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.400]  Of what?
[00:03:12.741 --> 00:03:13.701]  Of any sort of disease.
[00:03:14.322 --> 00:03:18.965]  As far as I know, a lot of diseases in Latin America are not common here in North America.
[00:03:19.545 --> 00:03:20.786]  We have not seen any of that.
[00:03:21.587 --> 00:03:27.991]  We did have a child who had a cold, had a flu, and we dealt with that.
[00:03:28.171 --> 00:03:33.855]  He was fine and able to go on his way, but it was the same kind of cold that you or I would have.
[00:03:34.055 --> 00:03:34.816]  How did you deal with it?
[00:03:34.836 --> 00:03:36.097]  Do you have a doctor off-site?
[00:03:36.567 --> 00:03:40.331]  We have actually one of our sisters, one of our nuns, is a medical doctor as well.
[00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:47.539]  We also have a mobile health clinic that serves our parishes here in the diocese anyway that came by and was able to offer services.
[00:03:47.978 --> 00:03:50.620]  If I may ask, how are the immigrants being sheltered here?
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.300]  Do they have cots?
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.381]  Do they sleep on the floors?
[00:03:52.801 --> 00:03:53.322]  On the floors.
[00:03:54.442 --> 00:03:57.084]  And how big is the area that they're staying in?
[00:03:57.444 --> 00:04:00.346]  Well, this is a former convent that we've used.
[00:04:00.546 --> 00:04:06.430]  So a convent is a place where religious people, nuns, and priests will live.
[00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.031]  So it's a living quarters situation.
[00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:14.336]  So there's kitchen, bathrooms, sleeping areas, meeting rooms.
[00:04:15.576 --> 00:04:17.638]  Because of that, it was a good place to do this.
[00:04:18.618 --> 00:04:24.420]  As you heard, John Andrews told us that his church group met with the feds to determine how they could help shelter illegal immigrants.
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.281]  He told NBC4 Southern California that the feds came to him.
[00:04:28.862 --> 00:04:35.124]  He also told us that illegal aliens were paying their own way, but he told Breitbart that his church group was giving them travel money.
[00:04:35.304 --> 00:04:36.504]  So what's the real story here?
[00:04:36.944 --> 00:04:39.905]  He's giving conflicting stories to different news outlets.
[00:04:40.185 --> 00:04:42.286]  This is Kit Daniels reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:05:02.588 --> 00:05:05.489]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
