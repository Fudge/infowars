[00:00:19.727 --> 00:00:21.668]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.728 --> 00:00:25.569]  It is Friday, June 13, 2014, and I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:26.710]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:35.434]  Tonight, a New York terror alert conditions law enforcement for far-right violence.
[00:00:36.194 --> 00:00:39.515]  Then, did FEMA anticipate the immigration crisis?
[00:00:40.356 --> 00:00:42.637]  And Alex Jones breaks down the U.S.
[00:00:42.677 --> 00:00:44.037]  connection to Al-Qaeda.
[00:00:44.717 --> 00:00:48.039]  That's next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:49.246 --> 00:00:53.932]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, I said that I had a big announcement and it's this.
[00:00:54.272 --> 00:00:57.977]  Obama is now the head, globally, of Al Qaeda.
[00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:05.792]  Well, as a flood of illegal immigrants surges across the border, some people are estimating that number could hit 90,000 by the end of the year.
[00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:11.633]  Well, somehow, all of those bizarre FEMA requests are now making a little bit more sense.
[00:01:12.073 --> 00:01:24.776]  Now, we've been reporting on all of these bizarre requests, including 24-hour emergency food supplies, hygiene kits, clothing and temporary housing, biohazard equipment and waste removal services, and of course,
[00:01:25.356 --> 00:01:31.600]  Buses to shuttle individuals from city to city in the event of some massive exodus.
[00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:34.722]  And so we're thinking, you know, well, this is strange.
[00:01:34.842 --> 00:01:35.743]  What are they planning for?
[00:01:36.163 --> 00:01:42.508]  Well, it turns out that these are exactly the types of items that are going to the surge of illegal immigrants.
[00:01:43.108 --> 00:01:51.954]  Now, before Big Sis left her perch as head of the DHS, she left a rather ominous warning about a coming natural disaster to the U.S.
[00:01:52.074 --> 00:01:54.315]  like none other the country has ever seen.
[00:01:55.276 --> 00:01:59.297]  Now it should be noted that the federal government has made a plan a long time ago.
[00:01:59.317 --> 00:02:06.980]  They developed this sort of military contingency plan to deal with an influx of illegal immigrants hitting the border.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.101]  And they wanted a plan to quell domestic disturbances in the event of this.
[00:02:12.141 --> 00:02:14.282]  Of course, this is what's happening today.
[00:02:14.302 --> 00:02:17.263]  It was called Operation Garden Plot.
[00:02:17.543 --> 00:02:20.165]  And it lists indicators of potential violence.
[00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:21.205]  And check these out.
[00:02:21.605 --> 00:02:24.827]  High unemployment and crime rates among minority groups.
[00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:29.570]  Protests arising from income disparity among minority and majority groups.
[00:02:29.991 --> 00:02:33.333]  Migrations of large numbers of minority groups.
[00:02:33.773 --> 00:02:40.457]  And protests by minority groups over conditions such as wages, jobs, housing, and police brutality.
[00:02:41.017 --> 00:02:41.838]  Now, of course,
[00:02:42.358 --> 00:02:46.443]  Doesn't that sound exactly like everything that's been going on recently?
[00:02:46.603 --> 00:02:55.893]  Obviously, it's very obvious to see that we've got this huge flow of migration of people across the border, all these illegal aliens coming, we're told to just turn away.
[00:02:56.394 --> 00:03:00.499]  But of course we're seeing a ton of protests for amnesty and wages and
[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.104]  Who do they think are going to replenish the ranks for all of these protests?
[00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:07.908]  You know, they've got a full army now.
[00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:09.390]  90,000 people by the end of the year.
[00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:16.820]  People that are going to be fighting over the bad wages these corporations think they're going to be paying all of these people when they get them here.
[00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:20.003]  These people are already complaining about cold eggs.
[00:03:20.624 --> 00:03:24.467]  You think they're really going to sit quietly while you think you're going to pay them pennies on the dollar?
[00:03:24.928 --> 00:03:29.852]  Now, part of this Operation Garden Plot includes RECS 84.
[00:03:29.992 --> 00:03:36.178]  It's a framework that outlined a plan for restoration of order, also known as martial law.
[00:03:36.418 --> 00:03:40.522]  Now, this plan was partly revealed during the Iran-Contra scandal.
[00:03:57.746 --> 00:04:09.417]  Up on screen are photocopies of the Miami Herald, and this goes back to the 1980s, when they had congressional
[00:04:10.575 --> 00:04:37.230]  hearings dealing with shadow government and martial law there's the headline the secret government and it talks about secret summits a plan to take over the government uh... and it shows the people that were in charge of the continuity of government dick cheney and others and then we have a congressional hearing where we have congressman jack brooks and others during our ram contra bringing up the secret plans and they're told by
[00:04:39.051 --> 00:04:41.377]  Congressman, in a way, that that can't be discussed.
[00:04:41.417 --> 00:04:43.302]  It's a national security issue.
[00:04:45.387 --> 00:04:51.911]  So here we're thinking, you know, this is just a premeditated plan to flood the country with voters who are going to vote for a bigger government.
[00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:53.532]  But it's more than that.
[00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:54.692]  It's deeper than that.
[00:04:55.213 --> 00:04:59.535]  This is exactly what they've been planning for since probably before 1984.
[00:05:00.116 --> 00:05:06.919]  This immigrant inflow emergency will be used to institute martial law.
[00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.661]  Their plan is right there.
[00:05:08.861 --> 00:05:09.841]  It's spelled out.
[00:05:10.161 --> 00:05:14.204]  All of the potential violence indicators, they have checked off.
[00:05:14.864 --> 00:05:17.365]  And FEMA anticipated this crisis.
[00:05:17.785 --> 00:05:19.025]  What more proof do you need?
[00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:22.967]  It's right there in front of you that this was a premeditated crisis.
[00:05:23.367 --> 00:05:29.249]  Now, people have, of course, been making the trek, you know, across the border forever, since there was a border, of course.
[00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:31.309]  But why so many people now?
[00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:42.113]  How are so many unaccompanied minor aliens making the trek from Central America through a virtual gang war zone to cross the border here?
[00:05:43.302 --> 00:05:45.703]  Seemingly so easily, like why so many now?
[00:05:46.204 --> 00:05:48.065]  And I'm not the only one that's wondering this.
[00:05:48.265 --> 00:05:49.706]  Ex-border agents agree.
[00:05:50.406 --> 00:05:51.407]  This is premeditated.
[00:05:51.807 --> 00:05:55.989]  They released a statement, the National Association of Former Border Patrol Officers.
[00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:59.151]  It reads, this is not a humanitarian crisis.
[00:05:59.591 --> 00:06:06.355]  It is a predictable, orchestrated, and contrived assault on the compassionate side of Americans by her political leaders.
[00:06:06.675 --> 00:06:12.199]  And it's knowingly putting minor illegal alien children at risk for purely political purposes.
[00:06:12.859 --> 00:06:25.657]  Certainly, we are not gullible enough to believe that thousands of unaccompanied minor Central American children came to America without the encouragement, aid, and assistance of the United States government.
[00:06:27.495 --> 00:06:29.216]  Of course, they're already doing this.
[00:06:29.316 --> 00:06:39.540]  You know, people are already saying that it's the de facto amnesty policies that were set out by the Obama administration that are encouraging people, you know, hey, if your kids make it across the border, we'll take them.
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.380]  We won't send them back.
[00:06:40.421 --> 00:06:42.201]  We'll take really good care of them, in fact.
[00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:45.663]  But they are already shoving it in our faces.
[00:06:46.483 --> 00:06:48.124]  Are you demonizing the children?
[00:06:48.504 --> 00:06:49.125]  Shame on you!
[00:06:49.185 --> 00:06:49.845]  These are kids.
[00:06:49.905 --> 00:06:50.526]  Just look at them.
[00:06:50.566 --> 00:06:51.326]  They're just kids.
[00:06:51.386 --> 00:06:53.387]  How dare you question them being here?
[00:06:53.868 --> 00:07:04.655]  Representative Luis Gutierrez is a vocal advocate of immigration reform and he told Breitbart News on Wednesday, shame on anybody that wants to demonize children.
[00:07:04.675 --> 00:07:14.481]  Of course, these children that are entering the country illegally, these are just kids and he's saying shame on anybody who questions that, anybody who doesn't give them
[00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:16.202]  Instant amnesty!
[00:07:16.562 --> 00:07:19.603]  And it's the same thing that's happening over at NPR.
[00:07:19.903 --> 00:07:23.484]  Now this was on a recent broadcast of NPR's On Point show.
[00:07:23.865 --> 00:07:30.307]  The host was joined by some immigration activists who suggested that all the youth illegally entering the U.S.
[00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:35.129]  in record numbers are desperate refugees who need the full support of the government.
[00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:40.231]  But one radio listener saw right through all this propaganda and called into the show and he said,
[00:07:40.891 --> 00:07:57.439]  With respect to your guests, I would like to just make a comment that when I hear phrases like, they're clutching their teddy bears, or they're wetting their pants in front of judges, this is an approach where we're being told that all 40,000 of these minor immigrants that have come here since October are all the same.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.121]  This is a technique used to stir passion.
[00:08:00.601 --> 00:08:02.862]  And of course, these comments raise red flags.
[00:08:03.182 --> 00:08:06.564]  He said, I don't believe that we should, without question, accept
[00:08:07.525 --> 00:08:10.229]  40,000 under 18 immigrants who are breaking the law.
[00:08:10.709 --> 00:08:19.922]  And not only did their parents break the law, they might even be coming here because they have been paid by drug gangs to engage in the drug business in America.
[00:08:21.784 --> 00:08:22.525]  And that's the truth.
[00:08:22.565 --> 00:08:24.467]  I mean, we already have Mexican drug cartels.
[00:08:24.507 --> 00:08:27.891]  They can be found in 2,000, more than 2,000 of our U.S.
[00:08:27.931 --> 00:08:28.211]  cities.
[00:08:28.531 --> 00:08:42.106]  I'm working on a report that will be coming out next week where a 14-year-old boy admits being abducted by the Sinaloa drug cartel when he was 11 years old and he was forced to participate in at least four beheadings.
[00:08:42.586 --> 00:08:44.267]  By the time he was 14 years old.
[00:08:44.628 --> 00:08:46.809]  So we have no idea who these children are.
[00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:48.771]  And that's not just coming from me.
[00:08:48.991 --> 00:09:00.220]  Arizona Governor Jan Brewer, who as you know, a lot of these illegal immigrants are being shipped to Arizona, she's concerned as well that MS-13 gang members could be coming in with these kids.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:10.824]  Now in a letter that she sent to House Speaker Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, she asks them to put an end to this intentional and unconscionable crisis at the border.
[00:09:10.844 --> 00:09:13.225]  And those are her words calling this intentional.
[00:09:13.725 --> 00:09:24.149]  Now she points out that by the Obama administration's own estimation, a quarter million alien miners are expected to cross through the Rio Grande sector by the end of next year.
[00:09:24.169 --> 00:09:25.690]  Now she says MS-13
[00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:35.573]  One of the world's most notorious international gangs has strong ties to several of the Central American countries where these aliens are arriving.
[00:09:35.994 --> 00:09:42.456]  Now the administration's refusal to properly verify that violent criminals are not among those entering the U.S.
[00:09:42.896 --> 00:09:46.898]  shows an alarming lack of concern for our homeland's security.
[00:09:47.498 --> 00:09:52.822]  And that is absolutely what border agents have told InfoWars exclusively as well.
[00:09:53.222 --> 00:10:00.407]  They say they are overwhelmed, there's no way they can patrol the borders, and that the worst of the worst criminals are slipping through the cracks.
[00:10:00.807 --> 00:10:04.089]  Just look at this footage from earlier today here in Texas.
[00:10:04.629 --> 00:10:11.694]  It shows an estimated 30 illegal aliens jumping out of an SUV that's being chased by a cop car.
[00:10:12.034 --> 00:10:16.898]  I mean, that's just one SUV carrying 30 illegal aliens in it.
[00:10:17.718 --> 00:10:18.880]  Absolute lawlessness.
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:20.862]  But we're being asked to look away.
[00:10:21.302 --> 00:10:27.109]  All reporters go down to San Antonio and try and get some footage, and they're detained and taken down to a basement.
[00:10:27.169 --> 00:10:30.273]  Meanwhile, these illegal aliens are being given the VIP treatment.
[00:10:30.693 --> 00:10:32.395]  But here, just
[00:10:32.415 --> 00:10:35.998]  Just in this San Antonio facility we have, you know, a thousand something kids.
[00:10:36.038 --> 00:10:40.042]  They're being taken care of at $250 a day.
[00:10:40.062 --> 00:10:49.251]  A taxpayer on the taxpayer dime, so if you stop and do the math, that is a half a million dollars a day at one facility.
[00:10:49.611 --> 00:10:53.975]  And yet, we're not allowed to know what's going on, how our taxpayer dollars are being spent.
[00:10:54.315 --> 00:10:55.215]  And it's not just us.
[00:10:55.276 --> 00:10:56.577]  It's not just reporters.
[00:10:56.937 --> 00:10:58.598]  It's our lawmakers as well.
[00:10:58.978 --> 00:11:05.163]  Obama is taking some lawmakers on a tour of one of these facilities, and they're not allowed to bring any recording devices.
[00:11:06.277 --> 00:11:17.604]  Basically the tour says no recording devices, no questions, no interactions with staff and children, and oh, we'll provide you with some photos that you can use after the event.
[00:11:18.144 --> 00:11:20.746]  So of course that's very typical of this administration.
[00:11:20.766 --> 00:11:23.308]  They tell any journalists who want to, you know, get
[00:11:23.988 --> 00:11:25.229]  Ask questions of the President.
[00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:27.189]  They say, oh, go check the White House website.
[00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:33.312]  There you can find pictures that we have for you and any official press releases of the President.
[00:11:33.412 --> 00:11:37.994]  So, of course, these pictures, just like those press releases, are going to be heavily sanitized.
[00:11:38.014 --> 00:11:43.376]  There's not going to be any proof or any evidence or any true documentation of what's going on there.
[00:11:44.096 --> 00:11:45.536]  This is going to be heavily sanitized.
[00:11:45.916 --> 00:11:53.778]  Now, one congressional staffer told the Daily Caller, he said, this isn't some totalitarian closed society that's trying this tactic.
[00:11:54.138 --> 00:11:55.178]  This is our own government.
[00:11:55.618 --> 00:12:02.120]  They clearly wouldn't be offering up this kind of dog and pony show if they weren't hiding a very ugly truth somewhere.
[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:09.081]  Now, he is exactly right about that, except he's wrong about this not being a totalitarian society.
[00:12:10.111 --> 00:12:12.473]  So of course, this should be an outrage.
[00:12:12.593 --> 00:12:14.394]  People should be really concerned about that.
[00:12:14.474 --> 00:12:21.459]  Our own government should be concerned that there could be violent gangs coming in across the border with this huge surge of illegal aliens.
[00:12:22.159 --> 00:12:23.560]  But that's not what they're concerned about.
[00:12:23.881 --> 00:12:25.482]  I mean, they're not concerned about them.
[00:12:25.702 --> 00:12:27.223]  They are all pro-government.
[00:12:27.503 --> 00:12:29.664]  They're worried about the anti-government people.
[00:12:29.764 --> 00:12:37.168]  The people who have a question about what the administration's doing with all these illegal aliens or how they're going to be spending our taxpayer dollars.
[00:12:37.508 --> 00:12:42.290]  If you have questions like this, well you're just anti-government and you are the terrorists.
[00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:43.271]  You are the real threat.
[00:12:43.991 --> 00:12:50.679]  And of course, this is the civil unrest they've been preparing for that we've been telling you about why the police are being militarized.
[00:12:51.219 --> 00:12:53.122]  Now this is Washington Times Today.
[00:12:53.562 --> 00:12:58.067]  Pentagon studying protesters to prep for mass civil breakdown.
[00:12:58.908 --> 00:13:01.830]  They are studying how social movement mobilizes.
[00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:08.553]  What starts it in the first place and their aim is to find when is the tipping point of civil uprisings.
[00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:17.898]  So they want to know where exactly the protests turn violent and basically how far can they go, how much can they push us, and at what point will people
[00:13:18.878 --> 00:13:19.839]  When will they have enough?
[00:13:19.879 --> 00:13:22.300]  So obviously they're studying social media and Twitter.
[00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:25.042]  They're following protesters and activists.
[00:13:25.643 --> 00:13:29.885]  Anyone who questions anyone who is anti-government, right?
[00:13:30.046 --> 00:13:34.869]  It's not the illegal aliens who don't really care about this country and what we stand for.
[00:13:35.309 --> 00:13:44.655]  They are going to demand that the government take care of them even more and better than they are right now because they're throwing away the cold eggs that they're giving them, allegedly.
[00:13:45.956 --> 00:13:51.118]  Cops are also being told to look out for more of this anti-government far-right extremism.
[00:13:51.458 --> 00:13:57.460]  Mikhail Thelin reports on a new counter-terrorism bulletin that's being passed around to New York State law enforcement.
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:04.642]  And it tells them specifically, prepare for increased violence from far-right extremists.
[00:14:05.263 --> 00:14:11.385]  Now Alex Jones has been saying, get ready, they are going to prepare another false flag that has to deal with
[00:14:12.205 --> 00:14:14.547]  Far-right extremists or patriots.
[00:14:14.607 --> 00:14:18.870]  But the fact is, most of the people in this country right now are anti-government.
[00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.131]  They have record low approval ratings.
[00:14:21.492 --> 00:14:24.474]  Now we have a failing Veterans Administration.
[00:14:24.574 --> 00:14:27.616]  All of our veterans are out there suffering, waiting to get health care.
[00:14:27.916 --> 00:14:29.037]  Some of them are homeless.
[00:14:29.137 --> 00:14:32.520]  Meanwhile, we're getting VIP treatment to illegal aliens.
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.061]  So, of course, people are going to be fed up even more.
[00:14:35.201 --> 00:14:38.704]  Why are our taxpayer dollars going for this and not for that?
[00:14:40.245 --> 00:14:48.274]  Law enforcement, your local law enforcement is being given war machinery to handle their civil unrest.
[00:14:48.955 --> 00:14:52.239]  People, they know we are about to hit critical mass.
[00:14:52.299 --> 00:14:54.181]  They've been prepping and planning for this.
[00:14:55.162 --> 00:14:59.924]  Well, while we're dealing with this, Iraq is experiencing an exodus of its own.
[00:15:00.124 --> 00:15:04.645]  People there are leaving the country because Al-Qaeda and ISIS is taking over.
[00:15:05.026 --> 00:15:08.447]  It is complete bloodshed, seemingly happening overnight.
[00:15:08.487 --> 00:15:11.748]  They're beheading soldiers, leaving them in the street as a warning.
[00:15:12.068 --> 00:15:16.010]  They've already instituted a really archaic form of Sharia law.
[00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:25.974]  Obama has announced today that he's not going to be sending any ground troops into Iraq to help out, but he will be considering strikes over the coming days.
[00:15:26.454 --> 00:15:31.877]  And of course, the corporate media is just salivating at the prospect of going to war.
[00:15:32.517 --> 00:15:32.917]  We're good.
[00:15:50.052 --> 00:15:57.241]  And of course, all of this just coincides perfectly with Obama promising that America is going to pull out of all the foreign war.
[00:15:57.261 --> 00:16:04.891]  We're going to focus a little more here at home, which is kind of an ominous thought now with all that we're going through currently.
[00:16:06.372 --> 00:16:12.854]  I don't really know if I want to close off the borders, because then that means, yeah, we can keep illegals out, but it also means that they can keep us in.
[00:16:13.194 --> 00:16:14.814]  So that's a very frightening thought.
[00:16:14.854 --> 00:16:20.176]  But of course, what the lamestream media is not covering is just how the U.S.
[00:16:20.296 --> 00:16:24.457]  is arming both sides of the conflict there in Iraq.
[00:16:24.777 --> 00:16:28.478]  Now this article is by Zero Hedge up on InfoWars.com.
[00:16:29.438 --> 00:16:31.840]  In its entirety, very detailed there.
[00:16:32.341 --> 00:16:35.763]  But coming up, Alex Jones is going to break this down.
[00:16:36.344 --> 00:16:41.929]  It'll be all-encompassing, just to really catch you up to speed on exactly what's going on there in Iraq.
[00:16:41.949 --> 00:16:44.010]  You're definitely not going to want to miss it.
[00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:45.872]  He blows it wide open.
[00:16:46.072 --> 00:16:46.873]  So, stick around.
[00:16:55.362 --> 00:17:00.944]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:17:01.144 --> 00:17:08.366]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:17:08.526 --> 00:17:11.747]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:17:11.887 --> 00:17:13.648]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:18.491]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:17:18.571 --> 00:17:21.312]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:17:21.492 --> 00:17:27.255]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:17:27.435 --> 00:17:30.917]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[00:17:31.117 --> 00:17:36.160]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.342]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:17:39.582 --> 00:17:45.446]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[00:17:45.566 --> 00:17:47.548]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.

[00:17:59.226 --> 00:18:02.567]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:18:02.667 --> 00:18:04.908]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:18:05.088 --> 00:18:13.370]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:15.711]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists,
[00:18:15.911 --> 00:18:29.802]  Pharmacist and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.

[00:18:57.281 --> 00:18:58.121]  InfoWarsLife.com
[00:19:06.658 --> 00:19:20.286]  Friday the 13th, 2014, has turned out to be a horrible day for Iraq, a terrible day for Syria, the Middle East, and the rest of the world, and especially the Christians of Iraq.
[00:19:20.747 --> 00:19:28.832]  They're having their heads chopped off or being shot in the back of the head, and the images are showing up in international newscasts
[00:19:29.372 --> 00:19:34.794]  Worldwide of Christian men, women, and children having their heads hacked off.
[00:19:35.254 --> 00:19:38.355]  800,000 fleeing Baghdad to Crete and other cities.
[00:19:38.896 --> 00:19:46.178]  Major cities across the nation of Iraq have fallen to the ISIS-Al Qaeda group, publicly funded by NATO.
[00:19:46.759 --> 00:19:55.282]  Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United States, and France in the last three and a half years attacking Libya, Syria, and our ally Egypt.
[00:19:55.822 --> 00:20:05.742]  This is part of a long-term deal with Saudi Arabia to turn the entire Middle East over to the Sunni-based Wahhabist system.
[00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:12.754]  Now, to understand what's happening currently, we're going to, in a few minutes, go into some of the history of this, because it's hidden in plain view.
[00:20:13.455 --> 00:20:17.658]  But because the population doesn't know history, they're doomed to repeat it.
[00:20:18.298 --> 00:20:24.042]  Most Americans know Al-Qaeda was founded by the United States government back in 1979 by Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[00:20:24.362 --> 00:20:29.526]  That was the name of the computer program of the CIA called the BASE, or in Arabic, Al-Qaeda.
[00:20:29.866 --> 00:20:31.988]  Fast forward, we're told they attacked us on 9-11.
[00:20:32.868 --> 00:20:34.108]  Al Qaeda is a real group.
[00:20:34.168 --> 00:20:34.989]  They are terrorists.
[00:20:35.009 --> 00:20:36.149]  They're funded by Saudi Arabia.
[00:20:36.369 --> 00:20:37.349]  They do attack people.
[00:20:37.869 --> 00:20:49.753]  But they're doing it for the criminals that work in the Western governments as a destabilizing secret army to cause civil wars, stage terror attacks, so the West can take our liberties, spy on us,
[00:20:50.353 --> 00:20:58.959]  Secretly arrest us and disappear us, torture us under the NDAA and Patriot Acts that both parties have supported.
[00:20:59.019 --> 00:21:01.801]  I'm going to go over some of the history and proof of that in a moment.
[00:21:02.122 --> 00:21:06.745]  Curt Nemo has a big article out tonight with all the links and proof at Infowars.com.
[00:21:08.618 --> 00:21:20.840]  Now, going back three and a half years ago, Western bases in Iraq, Associated Press, Reuters, you name it, were funding radical Islamists out of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and other Wahhabist-held areas.
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.181]  And the media said, is it good to be funding groups affiliated with Al-Qaeda?
[00:21:24.801 --> 00:21:26.781]  They're not affiliated with Al-Qaeda.
[00:21:27.221 --> 00:21:28.241]  They are Al-Qaeda.
[00:21:28.481 --> 00:21:30.242]  They fly the flag of Al-Qaeda.
[00:21:30.602 --> 00:21:32.882]  They are Wahhabists out of Saudi Arabia.
[00:21:33.562 --> 00:21:35.523]  It is the exact same thing.
[00:21:35.543 --> 00:21:37.703]  And they've now got medium and heavy weapons.
[00:21:38.945 --> 00:21:43.291]  From NATO and the West, that's what Benghazi was about, to attack Syria.
[00:21:43.611 --> 00:21:44.812]  That's not denied.
[00:21:45.779 --> 00:21:50.022]  And that's why Ted Cruz and others said we shouldn't be Al Qaeda's air force over there.
[00:21:50.502 --> 00:22:01.009]  And it stopped Obama from a full-scale air bombardment to turn Syria over to the very same group that couldn't take over Syria right across the border.
[00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:14.118]  I'm going to go over the map in a moment, who've now raced into Iraq, been left alone, been given weapons, who are now in a modern blitzkrieg with heavy weapons and thousands of brand new Mercedes,
[00:22:15.318 --> 00:22:23.886]  Toyota trucks, you name it, attacking and coming in and again literally executing police, military.
[00:22:23.946 --> 00:22:25.167]  I've got all the headlines here.
[00:22:25.467 --> 00:22:29.070]  We're going to be putting some of those on screen.
[00:22:29.911 --> 00:22:35.396]  Let me just go over some of these headlines before I break down the big picture and tell you the rest of the story as Paul Harvey would say.
[00:22:36.576 --> 00:22:39.819]  AP, America's being evacuated from Iraq Air Base.
[00:22:40.219 --> 00:22:41.560]  Jerome Corsi's on the radio show today.
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.161]  Contractors contacted him.
[00:22:43.181 --> 00:22:48.766]  200 of them are surrounded in a fort, in a base, by Al-Qaeda, swearing to kill them.
[00:22:48.986 --> 00:22:50.567]  The Al-Qaeda's real.
[00:22:50.787 --> 00:22:53.289]  They're being turned loose and armed by NATO.
[00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:54.910]  They will kill Americans.
[00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:55.791]  That's the number one target.
[00:22:56.592 --> 00:22:59.134]  Then there'll be bigger defense budgets to fight them later.
[00:23:00.401 --> 00:23:01.702]  This is very sophisticated.
[00:23:02.223 --> 00:23:04.145]  Even the low-level Al-Qaeda folks don't know this.
[00:23:04.205 --> 00:23:06.147]  It's the higher levels that are in it.
[00:23:06.207 --> 00:23:11.032]  And I have government documents and articles we're going to break down showing that in a moment from two other conflicts.
[00:23:12.076 --> 00:23:13.597]  Continuing, Iraq crisis.
[00:23:13.657 --> 00:23:25.223]  Baghdad prepares for the worst as Islamist militants vow to capture the capital and are now entering the capital and the police are fleeing and just throwing down their weapons because they were already run by the West and infiltrated.
[00:23:25.503 --> 00:23:27.084]  They've been told to basically stand down.
[00:23:27.604 --> 00:23:28.224]  Here's another one.
[00:23:28.404 --> 00:23:32.767]  ISIS butchers leave roads lined with decapitated police and soldiers.
[00:23:33.147 --> 00:23:39.210]  Battle for Baghdad looms as thousands answer Iraq government's call to arms and jihadists bear down on capital.
[00:23:40.131 --> 00:23:41.052]  This is unbelievable.
[00:23:41.072 --> 00:23:46.435]  The Iraqi government wasn't doing what they were told by the globalists, so now they send in al-Qaeda.
[00:23:47.096 --> 00:23:56.982]  ISIS is now imposing Sharia law, just like they did in Libya, and even our own government admits Libya is much worse than it was when Qaddafi was in.
[00:23:57.563 --> 00:24:01.485]  The executions are just continuing by the thousands an hour.
[00:24:02.126 --> 00:24:06.169]  It's being reported al-Qaeda flags, just as in Libya, are being hoisted up
[00:24:06.929 --> 00:24:07.289]  Everywhere.
[00:24:07.429 --> 00:24:10.351]  Our own government double-crossed our allies in Egypt a few years ago.
[00:24:10.792 --> 00:24:14.414]  Removed Hazi Mubarak, who was no angel, but he had stability.
[00:24:14.434 --> 00:24:15.294]  Christians were at peace.
[00:24:15.695 --> 00:24:16.535]  You could visit the country.
[00:24:16.555 --> 00:24:17.356]  There was basic freedom.
[00:24:17.576 --> 00:24:21.218]  Compared to now, Al-Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood were given power by the West.
[00:24:21.698 --> 00:24:23.540]  The military turned against that, overthrew them.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:28.483]  Our own government has been backing Al-Qaeda trying to overthrow and kill the Egyptian military.
[00:24:29.303 --> 00:24:33.206]  Remember that when you're at the airport and they want to grope your genitals because a Saudi Arabian terrorist?
[00:24:34.198 --> 00:24:36.899]  Remember, you're the terrorists, not them.
[00:24:36.959 --> 00:24:39.720]  They say the Tea Party is now the number one enemy, not Al-Qaeda.
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:49.982]  Al-Qaeda has got our Air Force drones already bombing over there, supposedly against them, and it's all just for show, so they can act like they're not arming them.
[00:24:50.303 --> 00:24:51.183]  And speaking of that...
[00:24:52.156 --> 00:24:54.457]  I have a couple articles that deal with that subject.
[00:24:55.037 --> 00:24:57.678]  This is out of the Wall Street Journal.
[00:24:58.218 --> 00:24:59.498]  It's also in the Daily Beast.
[00:24:59.638 --> 00:25:02.419]  Iraq's terrorists are becoming a full-blown army.
[00:25:03.179 --> 00:25:06.300]  Pentagon Iraq rebels may have captured U.S.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.681]  military equipment.
[00:25:07.741 --> 00:25:10.702]  The Hill, folks, they've given them the weapons in Benghazi.
[00:25:11.362 --> 00:25:12.662]  That's the cover-up for this.
[00:25:13.503 --> 00:25:14.243]  It's admitted.
[00:25:15.632 --> 00:25:19.195]  So there is literally a blitzkrieg taking place right now.
[00:25:19.215 --> 00:25:25.219]  800,000 refugees fleeing, and oh, they got those Stinger missiles from our military bases.
[00:25:25.339 --> 00:25:25.940]  Uh-huh.
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.882]  In Iraq, they found them on the side of the road.
[00:25:29.343 --> 00:25:33.666]  You found that robbed money from the bank, you know, in the back of a shoebox in the alley.
[00:25:35.387 --> 00:25:37.869]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:39.350]  But U.S.
[00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:43.613]  secretly flying drones over Iraq, but it's not stopping al-Qaeda.
[00:25:45.185 --> 00:25:48.146]  This is how dumb they think everyone is.
[00:25:48.186 --> 00:25:51.508]  And they'll say, oh, Obama looks like a fool now that Iraq's falling apart.
[00:25:52.068 --> 00:25:53.308]  It's his job to look like a fool.
[00:25:54.028 --> 00:25:56.049]  So the establishment can put all the blame on him.
[00:25:56.089 --> 00:25:56.670]  And he's terrible.
[00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:57.250]  I don't like him.
[00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:58.710]  But the point is, he's just a puppet.
[00:25:59.291 --> 00:26:06.233]  This is all meant on the grand chessboard to turn the whole Middle East over to Saudi Arabia, just as British intelligence has been doing since 1901.
[00:26:06.633 --> 00:26:08.474]  That's mainline history.
[00:26:08.794 --> 00:26:09.735]  I'm going to break that down.
[00:26:10.695 --> 00:26:12.336]  Here in just a moment.
[00:26:13.216 --> 00:26:17.037]  Congress says Iraq vets are hopelessly watching as their gains are lost.
[00:26:17.457 --> 00:26:24.240]  They were there to kick out the secular leader Saddam Hussein, who'd been a CIA officer, who was set up and told to attack Iran and Kuwait.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.220]  I'm not defending him.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.781]  But he was a CIA officer, not an asset.
[00:26:28.181 --> 00:26:29.102]  That's declassified.
[00:26:29.422 --> 00:26:29.802]  Look it up.
[00:26:30.779 --> 00:26:31.620]  He was put into power in 79.
[00:26:32.661 --> 00:26:33.461]  Shut up later.
[00:26:34.202 --> 00:26:42.829]  To then remove him, because they had women going to college and not wearing burkas, and rock and roll on the radio, and put Al Qaeda in charge of the whole region.
[00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:46.312]  But that was too obvious back in 2007, 8 or 9.
[00:26:46.753 --> 00:26:58.543]  So you've got to do it later with a Saudi Arabian proxy army, and that is in the Belfast Times mainstream news, breaking down the Saudi Arabians bragging
[00:26:59.841 --> 00:27:06.764]  That they have been funding the entire time the insurgency in Syria, Libya.
[00:27:06.784 --> 00:27:07.565]  I mean, that's on record.
[00:27:07.925 --> 00:27:10.386]  That's all over mainstream news three years ago.
[00:27:10.646 --> 00:27:12.967]  But they think you're dumb and don't remember that.
[00:27:13.248 --> 00:27:24.053]  Well, the Belfast time, Iraq crisis, Sunni caliphate has been bankrolled by Saudi Arabia, where 15 of the 19 hijackers came from, to then attack.
[00:27:25.274 --> 00:27:25.894]  Think about that.
[00:27:26.991 --> 00:27:28.172]  The country that had nothing to do with it.
[00:27:28.673 --> 00:27:41.967]  And now, 12 years after 9-11, two invasions of Iraq, a million dead Iraqis plus, Al-Qaeda is being given the country to murder every Christian they can get their hands on, and blow up mosques of minority Muslim groups that are peaceful.
[00:27:42.836 --> 00:27:55.122]  And it's all meant to cause a total Sunni-Shiite civil war between Iran and the proxy forces that are all over the Middle East in Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon.
[00:27:55.302 --> 00:28:00.465]  This is the stated clash of civilizations, the Wolfowitz Doctrine, the Brzezinski Doctrine.
[00:28:00.525 --> 00:28:01.405]  It's bipartisan.
[00:28:02.066 --> 00:28:05.167]  This is what Wesley Clark talked about, the plan to take all these countries.
[00:28:05.427 --> 00:28:06.588]  You do it by civil war.
[00:28:06.908 --> 00:28:09.590]  What's Obama want to do now with the gun confiscation plan he announced?
[00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:12.211]  Australian-style total confiscation last week.
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:14.661]  With an executive order they're looking at doing.
[00:28:14.861 --> 00:28:18.143]  They want to cause a civil war here, saying the Tea Party are terrorists.
[00:28:18.443 --> 00:28:19.204]  This isn't a game.
[00:28:19.484 --> 00:28:21.045]  This is rule by proxy army.
[00:28:21.725 --> 00:28:23.586]  Now let's go over some of the history of Al-Qaeda.
[00:28:24.347 --> 00:28:26.568]  Then I'll go to the map, show you what's currently happening.
[00:28:27.229 --> 00:28:27.889]  Undisputed.
[00:28:28.189 --> 00:28:30.851]  Lawrence of Arabia is just Hollywood's packaging of it.
[00:28:31.731 --> 00:28:34.493]  It really started in 1901, you can read it in the encyclopedia.
[00:28:35.093 --> 00:28:41.878]  They took a 200 square mile area held by some really hardcore bandits, who've been robbing caravans for thousands of years, the Wahhabist,
[00:28:43.444 --> 00:28:46.547]  They were bandits before they were even Muslims, before Muhammad even came along.
[00:28:47.087 --> 00:28:49.189]  And these are the folks where Islam started.
[00:28:50.431 --> 00:29:00.941]  And they were given weapons to take over from the old empire that the British were fighting in World War I, the Turks.
[00:29:02.242 --> 00:29:07.567]  And so, during that whole period, they then sent in the Wahhabis to finally overthrow
[00:29:09.406 --> 00:29:12.987]  The folks that were in Syria at that time and controlling most of the Middle East.
[00:29:13.007 --> 00:29:17.647]  It was a British Empire takeover of the Middle Eastern Empire of the Turks.
[00:29:18.368 --> 00:29:25.329]  Now, fast forward, the Turks are now under British control, under globalist control, in a power-sharing deal with NATO and the EU.
[00:29:25.569 --> 00:29:29.329]  And so they're attacking Syria today.
[00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:31.810]  So it's different today.
[00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:34.370]  But you can go read about the history of that.
[00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:35.771]  So this has always gone on.
[00:29:35.931 --> 00:29:36.931]  Al-Qaeda didn't start in
[00:29:39.319 --> 00:29:45.063]  79 officially it did, but it really started in 1901 under the first king of Saudi Arabia.
[00:29:45.083 --> 00:29:49.927]  It took him 30 years, 1901 to 1931, to take over the entire area.
[00:29:50.127 --> 00:29:52.208]  Now they're going to be given Iraq, Iran.
[00:29:53.149 --> 00:29:55.311]  They're being given everything.
[00:29:56.091 --> 00:30:01.355]  They're being allowed to invade and take over with jihadists as far south and west as Nigeria.
[00:30:02.341 --> 00:30:06.304]  I mean, Kenya, they're just shooting Christians everywhere, taking over.
[00:30:07.144 --> 00:30:10.706]  Again, our government financing them to kill Christians, that's the apple of their eye.
[00:30:10.946 --> 00:30:13.968]  This scandal is so huge, it's hiding in plain view and no one even knows this.
[00:30:14.409 --> 00:30:15.869]  I want to remind you this has been done before.
[00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:22.734]  Airlift of Evil, November 2001, one month after the fake invasion of Afghanistan.
[00:30:22.774 --> 00:30:27.577]  Our troops were getting killed fighting real Taliban, folks that didn't want to give up their property, give up their opium.
[00:30:28.541 --> 00:30:28.681]  I think?
[00:30:46.311 --> 00:30:48.092]  To start destabilizing Pakistan.
[00:30:48.112 --> 00:30:49.653]  And that's not just the admitted facts.
[00:30:50.813 --> 00:31:15.265]  General Hamid Gul, the former Supreme Commander of the military, the head, founder of operations against the Russians in Afghanistan, exclusively comes on our show five separate times to confirm my analysis and to say, yes, they've put Al-Qaeda here to destabilize and stir up the folks they're affiliated with, but real Muslims who are
[00:31:16.448 --> 00:31:24.639]  Affiliated with Wahhabist-type Sunnis, but aren't Al-Qaeda, to stir them up with drone attacks and other things, so they'll overthrow our secular government.
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:30.207]  Just like they're doing it in Syria, just like they're doing it in Iraq, and just like they use them in Europe and the U.S.
[00:31:30.247 --> 00:31:32.650]  to take our rights in the name of fighting the group.
[00:31:33.499 --> 00:31:34.379]  That they control.
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:41.001]  Al Qaeda is the secret army skeleton key meant to open every door for total control across the world.
[00:31:41.861 --> 00:31:43.861]  So there's the airlift of evil article.
[00:31:44.182 --> 00:31:44.582]  There it is.
[00:31:44.622 --> 00:31:49.523]  British special forces caught dressed up as Arab terrorists in 2006, 7 and 8.
[00:31:49.783 --> 00:31:53.964]  They got caught dressed up by Iraqi police attacking and shooting
[00:31:55.214 --> 00:32:00.795]  Shiites, so they could cause a war between Shiites and Sunnis and get a civil war going.
[00:32:01.155 --> 00:32:08.456]  Again, same story, BBC, Guardian, they all had to report on that operation when it got blown wide open.
[00:32:08.836 --> 00:32:17.098]  So if they can't get Al Qaeda into an area to stir stuff up, they'll dress up with the big Bin Laden beards, the turban on their head, the black flags, and go do it.
[00:32:17.138 --> 00:32:19.338]  We've shown you photos of those guys.
[00:32:19.518 --> 00:32:23.699]  They had to have tanks go into the Iraqi jail and blow it up just to get these guys out.
[00:32:24.755 --> 00:32:26.876]  Because they were being interrogated and it all came out.
[00:32:27.036 --> 00:32:28.916]  So, that's why we know how this works.
[00:32:28.956 --> 00:32:30.836]  You want to make trillions off defense contracting?
[00:32:31.817 --> 00:32:32.317]  No bids?
[00:32:33.657 --> 00:32:34.557]  Put Al-Qaeda in.
[00:32:35.318 --> 00:32:38.058]  Sure, some of the real Al-Qaeda hate Americans and even get killed.
[00:32:38.278 --> 00:32:39.359]  They're dumb grunts, too.
[00:32:39.419 --> 00:32:40.479]  They don't know the big picture.
[00:32:42.259 --> 00:32:45.060]  I talked to retired generals and they go, yeah, that's the plan.
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.520]  That's what generals really talk about, Alex.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:47.281]  You're right.
[00:32:47.361 --> 00:32:48.221]  That's the great strategy.
[00:32:49.241 --> 00:32:51.622]  I have to talk to three-star generals that people understand this.
[00:32:51.722 --> 00:32:53.122]  And it's so simple.
[00:32:55.316 --> 00:33:03.603]  I have conversations at night with congressmen, senators, generals, folks who are scared to come on my show and that's fine, but who want to talk to me because they know I understand this.
[00:33:03.803 --> 00:33:04.464]  I'm not bragging.
[00:33:05.164 --> 00:33:09.768]  I don't understand why I understand all this military stuff and the general public can't figure it out.
[00:33:10.048 --> 00:33:10.769]  It's so simple.
[00:33:12.925 --> 00:33:14.526]  I mean, I just do not understand it.
[00:33:14.746 --> 00:33:15.806]  This is in plain view.
[00:33:16.126 --> 00:33:16.986]  It's totally evil.
[00:33:17.506 --> 00:33:18.927]  And the public's like, gee, it's terrible.
[00:33:19.127 --> 00:33:27.970]  A secret Al Qaeda army with thousands of vehicles just showed up and is blitzkrieging and is taking major cities and is about to take Baghdad on Friday the 13th.
[00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.870]  How did they do it?
[00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:31.591]  Why do they have American arms?
[00:33:32.931 --> 00:33:33.551]  Oh, it sucks.
[00:33:33.571 --> 00:33:34.932]  They picked them up on the ground.
[00:33:36.345 --> 00:33:37.406]  This is insane.
[00:33:37.506 --> 00:33:38.367]  It shows the globalists.
[00:33:38.567 --> 00:33:40.649]  This is the beginning of World War III through proxy wars.
[00:33:40.929 --> 00:33:48.196]  Just like they put Nazis in control of Ukraine, overthrew it, Obama called it duly elected, and then when the Russians fight back, they're terrorists.
[00:33:48.256 --> 00:33:51.459]  I'm not siding with the Russians, but they're not doing all this.
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.042]  It's incredible how dangerous this is.
[00:33:55.783 --> 00:33:57.344]  World War II started with proxy wars.
[00:33:57.664 --> 00:33:59.046]  World War I started with proxy wars.
[00:34:00.456 --> 00:34:08.178]  I have been having dread, as you know, with all the stuff we see, but also in my gut, folks, and I think this weekend is going to be very serious.
[00:34:08.198 --> 00:34:09.659]  We need to be watching this very closely.
[00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:15.361]  Iran is saying they're going to send troops, and they've already sent in three brigades into Iraq, right over their border.
[00:34:16.241 --> 00:34:26.924]  I want to play Ted Cruz and Rand Paul warning about this six months ago, and we came together and stopped the open bombardment of Syria to put al-Qaeda fully in charge and kill every Christian in the country, literally.
[00:34:27.404 --> 00:34:29.265]  They're blowing up churches still every week there.
[00:34:30.492 --> 00:34:32.233]  This is a civil war across the Middle East.
[00:34:32.253 --> 00:34:37.834]  I want to go over to the map and break this down for you here in the new InfoWars studios.
[00:34:38.155 --> 00:34:40.115]  Please pray for InfoWars, this operation, as well.
[00:34:40.515 --> 00:34:41.776]  We're right at the tip of the spear.
[00:34:42.076 --> 00:34:44.917]  The eye of Sauron, of the globalists, is looking right at us.
[00:34:46.077 --> 00:34:53.259]  Because in the dark of the night, as the tyranny comes in, the light, the truth, like a candle on a hilltop, shines as a beacon.
[00:34:53.499 --> 00:34:54.660]  And InfoWars is a beacon.
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:58.921]  And I am very humble and try to do the very best job I can.
[00:34:59.342 --> 00:35:07.125]  And I want to thank you all for your prayers and for the fact that you've helped us be so successful together in this fight against the tyrants.
[00:35:07.405 --> 00:35:09.366]  Let's go to Ted Cruz and Rand Paul.
[00:35:11.386 --> 00:35:14.288]  We should be focused on defending the United States of America.
[00:35:14.348 --> 00:35:22.591]  That's why young men and women sign up to join the military, not to, as you note, you know, serve as Al Qaeda's air force.
[00:35:23.783 --> 00:35:29.448]  It's hard to argue that the Syrian rebels that you will be arming are not associated forces of Al-Qaeda.
[00:35:29.848 --> 00:35:32.070]  Are they not fighting on the same side of a war?
[00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:35.072]  Can you argue there's no connection between them?
[00:35:35.512 --> 00:35:37.354]  That really this is a three-way war?
[00:35:37.394 --> 00:35:39.095]  I know that's the way we're trying to break it down.
[00:35:39.155 --> 00:35:40.716]  I don't think it's that easy to say that.
[00:35:41.177 --> 00:35:45.900]  I think it's impossible to say that the Syrian rebels are not associated with Al-Qaeda.
[00:35:46.161 --> 00:35:50.244]  So there is a great irony that you will be arming forces that
[00:35:51.145 --> 00:35:57.012]  A normal common sense use of the word associated can say that these people are associated with Al-Qaeda.
[00:35:57.072 --> 00:35:57.432]  That's all.
[00:35:57.492 --> 00:35:58.714]  Thank you.
[00:35:59.715 --> 00:36:06.602]  Again, three years ago, InfoWars was one of the only media outlets pointing out that Al-Qaeda was really a secret army of NATO and the globalists.
[00:36:07.163 --> 00:36:10.006]  To destabilize the whole world and bring in tyranny as the response to it.
[00:36:10.686 --> 00:36:12.749]  Like something out of a Revenge of the Sith episode.
[00:36:14.653 --> 00:36:20.838]  Ladies and gentlemen, now, that's well known all over the world, that's mainstream news, but only on the Syria issue.
[00:36:21.578 --> 00:36:26.202]  We expose it in Iraq, that will shut down the entire operation.
[00:36:26.842 --> 00:36:29.464]  And again, I want there to be sovereign nations.
[00:36:29.524 --> 00:36:33.667]  I don't want to have one global power bloc that takes over Russia and takes over Iran.
[00:36:33.947 --> 00:36:40.372]  Especially if it's the Saudi Arabians, the worst in the Middle East, their government, not their people, that are going to run it all.
[00:36:41.293 --> 00:36:42.834]  I mean, no, I'm not a villain.
[00:36:44.221 --> 00:36:47.083]  Infowars isn't about chillin' with villains, and I know you're not as American.
[00:36:47.323 --> 00:36:49.044]  So let me just explain this once you see the map.
[00:36:49.304 --> 00:36:50.905]  It'll be easy to understand for new viewers.
[00:36:51.746 --> 00:36:54.267]  And send this on to the prostitute media, the dinosaur media.
[00:36:54.808 --> 00:36:55.628]  Explain it to them.
[00:36:55.988 --> 00:36:58.910]  Most of them know they're just whores, and they're going along with this evil.
[00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:00.631]  You are aiding and abetting Al Qaeda.
[00:37:00.911 --> 00:37:01.392]  Understand that.
[00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:04.612]  Now, you know about Iraq, you know about the overthrow.
[00:37:04.852 --> 00:37:06.233]  Put Saddam in in 1979.
[00:37:06.614 --> 00:37:07.794]  Tell him to attack Iran.
[00:37:08.155 --> 00:37:08.635]  Shut him up.
[00:37:08.675 --> 00:37:09.736]  Tell him to attack Kuwait in 1990.
[00:37:09.776 --> 00:37:11.317]  Tell him he can go ahead and do it.
[00:37:11.337 --> 00:37:11.818]  He does it.
[00:37:12.238 --> 00:37:12.959]  They invade.
[00:37:13.259 --> 00:37:15.300]  Not saying he's a good guy, but he was CIA.
[00:37:16.061 --> 00:37:16.682]  Who put him in there?
[00:37:17.062 --> 00:37:19.644]  Who sets this up for turmoil and destabilization?
[00:37:20.505 --> 00:37:22.907]  Now, fast forward to the last four years.
[00:37:23.607 --> 00:37:28.411]  Egypt wouldn't go along with overthrowing its neighbor, Libya.
[00:37:29.112 --> 00:37:30.533]  So, what did they do there?
[00:37:32.455 --> 00:37:42.506]  They overthrew that government, put the Muslim Brotherhood and Al-Qaeda in to move weapons into Benghazi in the east of Libya to then start the larger overthrow.
[00:37:43.227 --> 00:37:45.289]  Now it's under Sharia law, under Al-Qaeda control.
[00:37:45.649 --> 00:37:47.331]  The Al-Qaeda flag flies in most cities there.
[00:37:47.572 --> 00:37:48.092]  That's on record.
[00:37:48.112 --> 00:37:48.913]  We showed you those articles.
[00:37:49.153 --> 00:37:50.054]  Mainstream News admits that.
[00:37:50.295 --> 00:37:51.256]  Okay, so our government
[00:37:52.845 --> 00:37:56.548]  Bombarded Libya and did all that to put Al-Qaeda in charge.
[00:37:56.769 --> 00:37:57.509]  It's just continuing.
[00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:02.554]  Then, since Egypt didn't play ball, again they helped put them in there, but the Egyptian military threw them out.
[00:38:02.574 --> 00:38:04.475]  Because I guess they're bad.
[00:38:05.236 --> 00:38:06.257]  They don't like Al-Qaeda like me.
[00:38:06.697 --> 00:38:07.518]  Now let's continue.
[00:38:07.818 --> 00:38:16.426]  Then we've got, over here, you've got Iraq, you've got Syria, you've got Jordan, you've got areas of Lebanon, Israel,
[00:38:17.819 --> 00:38:18.800]  All of this going on.
[00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:23.623]  Now, right here in Western Iraq, in the last three years, the U.S.
[00:38:23.643 --> 00:38:31.429]  military and contractors were told to give weapons, missiles, you name it, to Syrian Al-Qaeda rebels to go across and attack Syria.
[00:38:31.889 --> 00:38:37.814]  They want to create a new country, the ISIS group, in between Syria and Iraq.
[00:38:37.894 --> 00:38:45.439]  A new Wahhabist Saudi Arabian cancer satellite, right here, out of part of Syria and part of Iraq.
[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:47.901]  Eastern Syria, Western Iraq.
[00:38:48.342 --> 00:38:48.622]  Okay?
[00:38:48.842 --> 00:38:49.663]  Breaking the country up.
[00:38:50.103 --> 00:38:55.687]  But instead, they're just going for it all, probably to end up cutting the country in two, which was one of the Pentagon plans.
[00:38:56.067 --> 00:38:58.749]  To make this part of Saudi Arabia, see Saudi Arabia?
[00:38:59.250 --> 00:38:59.530]  Boom!
[00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:00.510]  Part of Saudi Arabia.
[00:39:01.091 --> 00:39:05.214]  And then, again, carving out their own little operation right in here.
[00:39:05.254 --> 00:39:06.095]  That's what they get.
[00:39:06.875 --> 00:39:10.036]  They get their own little kingdom for doing this, and then Saudi Arabia gets all this.
[00:39:10.316 --> 00:39:11.156]  It'll all be the same thing.
[00:39:11.477 --> 00:39:15.258]  Okay, well Iran doesn't like that because they're the Muslim minority, Shiite, about 19%.
[00:39:15.478 --> 00:39:16.898]  This is about 79%.
[00:39:16.958 --> 00:39:22.980]  Sunni and Wahhabist are the enforcers of that.
[00:39:23.661 --> 00:39:26.481]  You know, 15 of the hijackers come from here, we attack Iraq.
[00:39:26.942 --> 00:39:30.043]  Now the people that supposedly attacked us on 9-11, we take over Iraq for them.
[00:39:30.863 --> 00:39:31.923]  You understand how evil this is?
[00:39:32.403 --> 00:39:33.764]  So, this is a proxy war.
[00:39:36.124 --> 00:39:39.265]  And this is meant to take down Iran, Russia, everybody else.
[00:39:39.525 --> 00:39:42.106]  This is the elected Iraqi government not doing anything to us.
[00:39:42.626 --> 00:39:47.767]  It's being overthrown by a NATO, Saudi Arabia, Obama, globalist-backed regime.
[00:39:48.628 --> 00:40:04.312]  That is the total plan to then break this into turning it into a Saudi Arabian state, taking over Syria, turning it into a Saudi Arabian state, or at least getting piece of it if they can't get the whole country, while killing every Christian they find in tolerant Syria, tolerant Iraq.
[00:40:04.932 --> 00:40:18.881]  Killing every Christian they can get their hands on, which the progressives in this country, the anti-Christian people for some reason love, and all the whore, right-wing, fake Christian folks won't even talk about or discuss.
[00:40:19.241 --> 00:40:27.487]  This is how sick it is, and when you go to the airport, they want to stick their hands down your pants to see if Al-Qaeda's in there, or check your baby's diaper to see if Al-Qaeda or bin Laden's in there.
[00:40:27.947 --> 00:40:32.150]  Meanwhile, they publicly run them, and the media's all acting like they don't know what's going on.
[00:40:32.431 --> 00:40:35.793]  Gee, this army, this blitzkrieg, just attacked and took over.
[00:40:36.073 --> 00:40:37.194]  We don't know where they came from.
[00:40:37.354 --> 00:40:40.317]  They were armed right here on the border with Syria.
[00:40:40.517 --> 00:40:44.780]  You go up here to Turkey, they've got al-Qaeda training camps on record invading Syria.
[00:40:45.201 --> 00:40:49.744]  Al-Qaeda's being given bases everywhere, just like they were in Pakistan by the CIA.
[00:40:51.007 --> 00:40:52.748]  The CIA doesn't work for America, folks.
[00:40:52.788 --> 00:40:55.830]  It works for special, globalist, monopoly interest.
[00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:57.991]  Now, that's our breakdown.
[00:40:58.011 --> 00:40:59.632]  This report is very important.
[00:41:00.493 --> 00:41:19.304]  This humanitarian crisis is just so massive right now, and they're also taking Saudi Arabian Wahhabis into areas of Sudan and other areas, while claiming they're fighting radical Islam, and going into the rest of Africa, into Kenya, all the way over to the western coast of Nigeria.
[00:41:20.526 --> 00:41:22.006]  These groups work for the globalists.
[00:41:22.307 --> 00:41:23.007]  Not our government.
[00:41:23.207 --> 00:41:24.327]  Criminal groups above it.
[00:41:24.607 --> 00:41:25.508]  And it's a fact.
[00:41:26.188 --> 00:41:29.549]  You now have been given exactly what's happening on this Friday the 13th.
[00:41:30.009 --> 00:41:40.972]  Let's go from our new studios over to Studio B with Liam McAdoo and the conclusion of InfoWars Nightly News for this Friday the 13th, 2014 transmission.
[00:41:41.253 --> 00:41:45.474]  And remember, if you're watching or listening to this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:48.570]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:41:49.111 --> 00:41:51.592]  Well, let's close the show with some good news.
[00:41:52.033 --> 00:42:00.218]  Less than 24 hours after the food babe launched her petition on the Alex Jones Radio Show yesterday, the big beer makers responded.
[00:42:00.518 --> 00:42:07.162]  Anheuser-Busch posted ingredients for two of their most popular beers, and they say that they'll post the others soon.
[00:42:07.562 --> 00:42:10.024]  Now, Miller Coors announced that they'll be following suit.
[00:42:10.484 --> 00:42:17.948]  So, of course, no doubt they responded so quickly to this story, because they didn't want it to get legs, of course, through the media, the way the whole Subway story went.
[00:42:17.988 --> 00:42:19.208]  That one just launched.
[00:42:19.689 --> 00:42:28.233]  So, they only released the ingredients for their two most popular beers, which just so happen to have pretty basic beer-making ingredients.
[00:42:29.093 --> 00:42:39.219]  We will have to just wait and see if some of those other beers include the plain de-icing liquid that Food Babe says is being used in a lot of these beers.
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:44.803]  Now, of course, this petition just shows the power of the people.
[00:42:45.103 --> 00:42:46.844]  Once again, same with the Subway petition.
[00:42:46.884 --> 00:42:58.387]  She came on our show, all of our people got behind it, and less than 24 hours later, Subway responded and they said, we're sorry, we'll take that yoga mat foam out of our bread.
[00:42:58.787 --> 00:43:00.048]  Same thing with the beer makers.
[00:43:00.128 --> 00:43:05.010]  It's all because of you guys, people like you, and we just want to say thank you.
[00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:06.350]  Now if you're watching this,
[00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:11.114]  On YouTube, please go to Prison Planet TV and become a member.

[00:43:27.807 --> 00:43:29.668]  So thank you guys so much for tuning in tonight.
[00:43:30.008 --> 00:43:33.951]  Stay tuned, I've got a very special interview with Doc Wallach.
[00:43:34.071 --> 00:43:34.552]  He is
[00:43:35.093 --> 00:43:40.768]  Not only the pioneer behind longevity, but also the pioneer of epigenetics.
[00:43:41.088 --> 00:43:43.014]  And he's going to be talking with us about his new book.
[00:43:51.417 --> 00:43:58.584]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:43:58.684 --> 00:44:00.846]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:44:01.046 --> 00:44:06.231]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:44:06.391 --> 00:44:11.496]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:44:11.636 --> 00:44:14.739]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:44:15.019 --> 00:44:18.942]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:44:19.143 --> 00:44:23.466]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:44:23.547 --> 00:44:33.675]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:44:33.896 --> 00:44:36.458]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:44:36.658 --> 00:44:38.260]  And manufactured in the USA.
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:44.807]  The new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:44:44.967 --> 00:44:48.971]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:44:55.365 --> 00:44:57.006]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:44:57.246 --> 00:45:00.787]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:45:00.907 --> 00:45:05.289]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:45:05.429 --> 00:45:11.431]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:45:11.551 --> 00:45:22.315]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[00:45:22.535 --> 00:45:28.840]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:46.012]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:45:46.353 --> 00:45:50.756]  Get your Pro-Pure with a new Pro-1 filter today at InfoWarsTore.com
[00:45:50.976 --> 00:45:51.638]  Or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:46:02.605 --> 00:46:05.207]  Well, we all know that it's important to eat healthy.
[00:46:05.647 --> 00:46:14.472]  But can we trust that the foods that we're now eating are infused with the proper vitamins and nutrients and minerals that are necessary to keep our bodies functioning properly?
[00:46:14.912 --> 00:46:17.134]  Well, that's the general idea of epigenetics.
[00:46:17.614 --> 00:46:22.076]  And today I'm going to be speaking with the pioneer of epigenetics, Dr. Joel Wallach.
[00:46:22.177 --> 00:46:24.678]  He joined us in studio to talk about his new book.
[00:46:26.019 --> 00:46:28.220]  So thank you so much for joining us, Doc Wallach.
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:30.942]  It's a pleasure to have you actually in studio.
[00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:33.031]  Well, thank you Leanne.
[00:46:33.091 --> 00:46:34.552]  It's a pleasure to be with you.
[00:46:34.572 --> 00:46:36.073]  I always like to be around the young ladies.
[00:46:36.274 --> 00:46:37.034]  Yes, you know.
[00:46:37.054 --> 00:46:38.736]  Well, I'm like a huge fan.
[00:46:38.756 --> 00:46:41.018]  I get pollen burst every day before the show.
[00:46:41.058 --> 00:46:42.039]  It really works for me.
[00:46:42.079 --> 00:46:43.620]  I like that little rush.
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:45.362]  Vitamin B and the niacin.
[00:46:46.294 --> 00:46:49.316]  And SOD, superoxide, just mutates, gets the oxygen in the cells.
[00:46:49.797 --> 00:46:51.518]  Yeah, it's a very famous product, actually.
[00:46:51.538 --> 00:46:55.121]  It was the sports drink of the Flying Fins.
[00:46:55.581 --> 00:46:57.502]  Most people your age don't know who the Flying Fins were.
[00:46:57.522 --> 00:47:10.953]  They were actually the Finlanders track team in the Olympics in 1972 and 1976, and they won all the track and field events, and the newspaper reporters dubbed them the Flying Fins.
[00:47:11.933 --> 00:47:18.096]  And they had their special secret drink that they had, and it turns out that it's pollen burst is what it is.
[00:47:18.136 --> 00:47:18.296]  Wow!
[00:47:18.336 --> 00:47:25.639]  And it went through several pharmaceutical companies, and then we actually acquired that product, and it's one of our favorite products.
[00:47:25.759 --> 00:47:28.120]  It's a great product.
[00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:29.261]  It's organic.
[00:47:29.741 --> 00:47:34.543]  It's made from organic flower pollen, not bee pollen, but flower pollen from Switzerland.
[00:47:38.925 --> 00:47:44.428]  Professional athletes, Olympic athletes can take it and they won't test bad for anything that they're looking for in these tests.
[00:47:45.408 --> 00:47:46.349]  Like lamps, you know.
[00:47:46.409 --> 00:47:47.309]  Right, exactly.
[00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:50.031]  Nothing will test bad because it's all natural, organic.
[00:47:50.411 --> 00:47:50.771]  Correct.
[00:47:50.791 --> 00:47:53.853]  Like now all the athletes have is like Gatorade and things like that.
[00:47:54.553 --> 00:47:54.873]  Ouch!
[00:47:54.953 --> 00:47:57.114]  Well, Gatorade has two nutrients in it.
[00:47:57.595 --> 00:47:58.635]  Powerade has six.
[00:47:59.296 --> 00:48:04.798]  Our Longevity version of Sports Drink, which is called Rebound, has a hundred nutrients in it.
[00:48:04.818 --> 00:48:05.319]  So let's see.
[00:48:05.959 --> 00:48:09.942]  If you're going to be an athlete and you're sweating out nutrients, do you want to replace it with distilled water?
[00:48:10.042 --> 00:48:11.002]  No, there's none in there.
[00:48:11.022 --> 00:48:14.445]  Gatorade is 2, Powerade is 6, and then there's Rebound with 100.
[00:48:15.165 --> 00:48:15.646]  Exactly.
[00:48:15.666 --> 00:48:30.876]  Well, and my favorite flavor is the acai berry, but now I'm reading some new reports coming out saying that, you know, the acai and blueberries and all of these antioxidants to stop with, you know, anti-aging cures and everything is kind of a sham.
[00:48:31.336 --> 00:48:32.077]  What do you think about that?
[00:48:32.984 --> 00:48:42.211]  Well, the principle is quite correct, that the antioxidants do help your genes maximize their genetic potential.
[00:48:43.012 --> 00:48:46.935]  For instance, you might have genes that will allow you to live to be 200 if you do everything right.
[00:48:47.576 --> 00:48:50.578]  But if you don't do everything right, that gene can't do it by itself.
[00:48:50.618 --> 00:48:52.400]  You need the raw materials for it to get there.
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:59.625]  For instance, if you have a car like a Lamborghini and it says you need 6 quarts of oil in there, that car will go 300,000 miles before you need a new engine.
[00:49:01.006 --> 00:49:07.031]  If you only put 6 quarts of water in that crankcase instead of 6 quarts of oil, is that car going to get 300,000 miles?
[00:49:07.051 --> 00:49:07.211]  No.
[00:49:07.532 --> 00:49:10.874]  You might not even get one tank full of gas distance.
[00:49:10.894 --> 00:49:13.897]  You might not go 500 miles before the engine burns up with water.
[00:49:14.477 --> 00:49:16.219]  And so the same thing is true with our jeans.
[00:49:16.239 --> 00:49:18.000]  You can have jeans that will allow you to live to be 200.
[00:49:19.381 --> 00:49:31.892]  But if you're just trying to eat well, which is what everybody said, I ate well, and then you're not getting guaranteed, drop dead guaranteed, giving your genes everything they need to maximize your genetic potential for longevity and health.
[00:49:32.672 --> 00:49:34.093]  And so we have to be smarter than that.
[00:49:34.654 --> 00:49:39.118]  And I think what makes my background different, Leanne, is that I'm a veterinarian as well as a physician.
[00:49:39.838 --> 00:49:52.749]  And in veterinary medicine we don't have health insurance for animals, and if we were to use a human health care system for livestock like we do people, a dozen eggs would be $250, a pound of hamburger would be $500 just to pay for the health care system.
[00:49:53.330 --> 00:50:04.519]  So we learned a long time ago that we could prevent diseases, we could prevent birth defects, we could maximize production of meat, eggs, and milk for a pound of feed by just giving these animals vitamins and minerals.
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:06.060]  Now I'm one of the authors
[00:50:06.861 --> 00:50:11.123]  of the Animal Welfare Act of 1964, because animals were being abused.
[00:50:11.603 --> 00:50:20.586]  And so I actually was part of a team of six guys from the National Science Foundation, who I was working for at the time, to come up with the Animal Welfare Act, which is passed in Congress.
[00:50:20.686 --> 00:50:27.469]  It's a federal law now that even laboratory animals under experimental circumstances had to be cared for in a very, very
[00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:30.311]  Kindly and judicious way.
[00:50:30.331 --> 00:50:37.137]  You can't leave them without water and food over the weekend so they cannibalize each other and that sort of stuff and make up the results of the experiment.
[00:50:37.858 --> 00:50:42.843]  And so we took care of that with that Animal Welfare Act and so I was very very proud of my association with that.
[00:50:43.254 --> 00:50:43.414]  Yeah.
[00:50:43.675 --> 00:50:44.876]  Thank you for that, by the way.
[00:50:45.957 --> 00:50:52.024]  Now, you were mentioning a lot of people eat healthy, which is what I do, but I do not supplement.
[00:50:52.124 --> 00:50:55.408]  I'm really bad at taking vitamins and things.
[00:50:55.508 --> 00:50:56.650]  I can't do it.
[00:50:56.730 --> 00:50:58.392]  I mean, I'm good now with the droppers.
[00:50:58.432 --> 00:51:01.495]  That's a little bit easier for me, but the pills, I just don't like that.
[00:51:02.056 --> 00:51:06.938]  Well then, you're going to love the Beyond Tanned Tangerine 2.0, which is a Nutri-Crystal.
[00:51:07.398 --> 00:51:18.021]  It's kind of built on the coffee crystal technology, and you add, say, two scoops to 10 ounces of water in one of the little bottles, and it turns into a liquid.
[00:51:19.022 --> 00:51:21.343]  And the 2.0 tastes like peaches.
[00:51:21.963 --> 00:51:22.603]  People just love it.
[00:51:22.623 --> 00:51:26.104]  I mean, this is one of Alex's favorites, and it has 245 nutrients in it.
[00:51:28.385 --> 00:51:29.026]  You're guaranteed it.
[00:51:29.086 --> 00:51:33.070]  Now, a couple days ago, I just, in the Chinese system, turned 75.
[00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:35.713]  In the American system, I turned 74 plus.
[00:51:36.474 --> 00:51:40.879]  And I haven't been to a doctor with me being sick in 68 years.
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.381]  I've never been on a prescription medication.
[00:51:44.591 --> 00:51:46.772]  And I've been taking the 90 Cents of Nutrients twice a day.
[00:51:46.792 --> 00:51:48.133]  You're 75?
[00:51:48.333 --> 00:51:48.713]  Yes, ma'am.
[00:51:49.353 --> 00:51:49.654]  Wow.
[00:51:50.174 --> 00:51:51.595]  Your skin is very supple.
[00:51:51.655 --> 00:51:52.895]  I wasn't going to say anything.
[00:51:53.576 --> 00:51:55.236]  Well, nobody's going to steal an airplane with me on it.
[00:51:55.897 --> 00:51:57.518]  I'll tell you, I can still whoop up on them.
[00:51:58.178 --> 00:52:01.960]  And that's because I do take the 90 Cents of Nutrients twice a day, faithfully.
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:06.342]  Obsessively is probably a better word, because I have three suitcases.
[00:52:06.743 --> 00:52:14.087]  They weigh 70 pounds each, which I check in with me no matter where I go, and 50 pounds in each of those three suitcases are my supplements that I take with me.
[00:52:14.307 --> 00:52:14.567]  Wow.
[00:52:14.787 --> 00:52:20.711]  I don't depend on having just a few bottles with me and I run out and say, well, I was without it for a month because I ran out.
[00:52:21.071 --> 00:52:21.892]  That will never happen.
[00:52:22.592 --> 00:52:23.934]  And I've been blessed.
[00:52:25.075 --> 00:52:26.657]  And of course, I have four children.
[00:52:26.697 --> 00:52:29.460]  I have eight grandchildren, four great-grandchildren.
[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:33.585]  They've never been sick because they've been taking the 90 essential nutrients before they were conceived.
[00:52:34.006 --> 00:52:36.108]  All the pregnancies are developed in from the moment they're born.
[00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:41.042]  And we can make America a birth defect free country.
[00:52:41.443 --> 00:52:43.864]  We can make America a diabetes free country.
[00:52:43.904 --> 00:52:47.526]  We can make America a heart disease free country.
[00:52:47.566 --> 00:52:50.307]  We can make America an Alzheimer's disease free country.
[00:52:50.347 --> 00:52:59.533]  We can make America a macular degeneration blindness disease free country in months by taking the 90 cents of nutrients to give your genes
[00:53:00.373 --> 00:53:05.094]  The cofactors they need to give you the maximum benefits for health and longevity.
[00:53:05.374 --> 00:53:05.534]  Right.
[00:53:05.574 --> 00:53:06.855]  Without that, it's kind of hit and miss.
[00:53:07.195 --> 00:53:07.355]  Right.
[00:53:07.375 --> 00:53:10.315]  This goes all the way back to Hippocrates, right?
[00:53:10.475 --> 00:53:13.336]  Talking about food being the basic for all health.
[00:53:13.396 --> 00:53:20.118]  Figure out how to regulate and make sure the person's diet is good and you'll figure out how to heal them and make them healthy.
[00:53:20.138 --> 00:53:21.638]  Let your food be your medicine.
[00:53:21.798 --> 00:53:22.379]  Exactly.
[00:53:22.399 --> 00:53:31.807]  And so you were saying, you know, for someone like me who does eat well and I eat properly, I'm mostly a vegetarian, but the issue is the soil.
[00:53:31.827 --> 00:53:33.088]  I'm missing the minerals.
[00:53:33.809 --> 00:53:36.171]  They're not even in the soil feeding the plants.
[00:53:36.271 --> 00:53:39.174]  Okay, you hit the nail on the head there, Leanne.
[00:53:39.214 --> 00:53:40.755]  That's a principal problem we have.
[00:53:41.656 --> 00:53:44.358]  And there's two things, two events that did that to us.
[00:53:44.619 --> 00:53:45.800]  We knew the exact moments.
[00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:53.126]  At three o'clock in the afternoon, Monday, September 4th, 1882, on Pearl Street in New York City, everything changed.
[00:53:53.526 --> 00:53:56.608]  For thousands and thousands and thousands of years, we had gotten our
[00:53:57.549 --> 00:54:02.352]  Minerals from plant minerals, aka wood ashes, which went into our garden.
[00:54:02.393 --> 00:54:06.355]  Every day you take the wood ashes from the fireplace or the stove and you throw them in the garden.
[00:54:06.375 --> 00:54:17.844]  And the corn and the beans and peas and the sweet potatoes and onions and okra and tomatoes would suck up all these minerals you threw into the garden with the wood ashes.
[00:54:18.844 --> 00:54:20.826]  And you'd eat the food and you got your meals in that fashion.
[00:54:21.106 --> 00:54:28.832]  Well, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, Monday, September 4th, 1882, on Pearl Street in New York City, Thomas Edison pulled the switch on the first commercial electric generating plant.
[00:54:29.233 --> 00:54:38.380]  Within 10 years, Leanne, every city and every municipality and every town in the industrialized world converted from wood as the universal fuel to electricity.
[00:54:39.306 --> 00:54:39.526]  Wow.
[00:54:39.907 --> 00:54:44.910]  And immediately then, the source of nutritional minerals we'd had for thousands of years went away.
[00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:49.373]  Because there's no wood ashes left over when you fuel your home with electricity.
[00:54:50.294 --> 00:54:52.576]  Now a second thing happened, which is even more devastating.
[00:54:53.757 --> 00:55:00.121]  About the same time, because people wanted more electricity, we started building all these hydroelectric plants and dams all across all the big rivers in America.
[00:55:00.481 --> 00:55:06.646]  Missouri River, Mississippi River, Columbia River, the Albany River, Hudson River, and so forth.
[00:55:08.323 --> 00:55:11.425]  And we dammed up all these rivers, the Tennessee River, we dammed them all up.
[00:55:12.766 --> 00:55:19.170]  Well, what happened was, for thousands and thousands and thousands of years, since the beginning of time, rivers would flood every year.
[00:55:19.711 --> 00:55:22.973]  And when the water would recede, they would leave silt behind on the fields.
[00:55:23.713 --> 00:55:27.316]  These are the most expensive and the most fertile farmlands were flood plains.
[00:55:28.036 --> 00:55:29.017]  Bottomland, they called it.
[00:55:29.957 --> 00:55:34.941]  And would the farmers scrape that silt, that mud off from the flood, off to the side?
[00:55:35.141 --> 00:55:36.722]  No, they would till it in the soil.
[00:55:38.348 --> 00:55:38.448]  Wow.
[00:55:38.628 --> 00:55:43.491]  We dammed up all the rivers, so what's the people who manage these dams, what do they complain about?
[00:55:43.511 --> 00:55:44.871]  All the silt building up behind the dams.
[00:55:44.891 --> 00:55:46.432]  It never gets to the fields anymore.
[00:55:46.452 --> 00:55:46.872]  Right.
[00:55:47.312 --> 00:55:54.636]  So over 25 years after the rivers were dammed up and electricity came online, we were still growing plants and
[00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:59.864]  We grew the plants, and they sucked up all the minerals out of the soil, and then there was no minerals in the soil.
[00:55:59.884 --> 00:56:02.827]  We got the dust bowl, but there was nothing in the soil.
[00:56:02.967 --> 00:56:04.189]  No plants could live.
[00:56:04.729 --> 00:56:10.315]  And so they invented synthetic fertilizer, which has no nutrition in it for humans, but it makes the plants grow.
[00:56:10.635 --> 00:56:11.696]  And they get paid for yield.
[00:56:11.716 --> 00:56:13.879]  They don't get paid for how much nutrition is in the food.
[00:56:14.319 --> 00:56:16.201]  Farmers get paid by yield, tons and bushels.
[00:56:16.581 --> 00:56:16.822]  Right.
[00:56:17.162 --> 00:56:17.463]  I think so.
[00:56:31.414 --> 00:56:34.016]  You're guaranteed you're going to get everything you need to have perfect babies.
[00:56:34.576 --> 00:56:40.360]  We will not have another birth defect if everybody took the 90th Century Nutrients before they conceived a child.
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:40.960]  Right.
[00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:47.044]  Every birth defect you can name and ten times that many you can't, Leanne, are all caused by nutritional deficiencies of the embryos.
[00:56:47.084 --> 00:56:53.008]  There's not a single disease that a baby is born with that is caused by genetics.
[00:56:53.068 --> 00:56:55.050]  It's all nutritional deficiencies of the embryo.
[00:56:55.831 --> 00:57:05.500]  So for someone like me, a woman, I have yet to have children and I know, obviously, just basic science, we're born with all of the eggs we're ever going to have as women.
[00:57:06.922 --> 00:57:11.646]  Am I able to turn back time or have I already done the damage?
[00:57:12.247 --> 00:57:18.192]  No, you haven't done the damage yet because the clock starts ticking on danger for the embryo at the moment of conception.
[00:57:18.212 --> 00:57:19.373]  Okay?
[00:57:19.753 --> 00:57:21.875]  When the sperm fertilizes the egg, that's it.
[00:57:22.395 --> 00:57:25.398]  If you don't have all the nutrients at that point, the baby's in danger.
[00:57:26.018 --> 00:57:30.482]  We're talking Down syndrome, we're talking everything as simple as lactose intolerance,
[00:57:32.984 --> 00:57:39.289]  Things like PKU, phenylkinylurea, where babies get retarded from breakdown products on amino acid.
[00:57:40.170 --> 00:57:48.297]  Things like type 1 diabetes, cerebral palsy, cleft palate, spina bifida, muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis.
[00:57:48.337 --> 00:57:59.927]  In fact, I found the first non-human case, and this is me on the cover of the book, with my cystic fibrosis monkeys back in 1977 at Yerkes Primate Center in Atlanta, Georgia at Emory University.
[00:58:00.547 --> 00:58:08.755]  And everybody agreed that's what it was, but they said, well, Wallach, you're saying it's a genetic, it's not a genetic disease, you're saying it's caused by a nutritionally deficient embryo.
[00:58:08.775 --> 00:58:09.135]  That's right.
[00:58:09.616 --> 00:58:10.216]  They fired me.
[00:58:10.757 --> 00:58:12.418]  That's why I went back to school and became a physician.
[00:58:12.438 --> 00:58:14.180]  Because you were going to heal everyone.
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:14.761]  Exactly.
[00:58:14.781 --> 00:58:15.721]  They didn't like that part.
[00:58:15.842 --> 00:58:16.602]  Pharmaceuticals.
[00:58:16.622 --> 00:58:23.209]  Yeah, that's why Alex loves that book, and loves the story, because it shows very clearly that to keep
[00:58:24.272 --> 00:58:28.757]  Doing what they're doing, rather than follow the truth, they're willing to kill off the truth.
[00:58:29.178 --> 00:58:32.421]  For instance, we know the cause, prevention, and cure of muscular dystrophy.
[00:58:32.822 --> 00:58:34.423]  We gave that information to Jerry Lewis.
[00:58:34.684 --> 00:58:35.525]  Jerry, we don't want any money.
[00:58:35.545 --> 00:58:36.386]  We've already found the cure.
[00:58:36.406 --> 00:58:37.707]  Do you want to be the one to make the announcement?
[00:58:37.747 --> 00:58:39.529]  Jerry, you are the guy.
[00:58:39.569 --> 00:58:40.450]  These are Jerry's kids.
[00:58:40.530 --> 00:58:42.613]  You deserve to make the announcement that the cure's been found.
[00:58:43.093 --> 00:58:44.134]  He took all that information
[00:58:44.795 --> 00:58:47.836]  To the Mustard History Foundation, and they fired him four years ago.
[00:58:48.216 --> 00:58:49.916]  That's why he has not been doing the telephones.
[00:58:50.196 --> 00:58:50.316]  Wow.
[00:58:50.336 --> 00:58:55.237]  The Mustard History Foundation fired Jerry Lewis after 22 years and raising billions of dollars for them.
[00:58:55.277 --> 00:58:59.018]  They fired him because he brought them the cure for Mustard History.
[00:58:59.298 --> 00:58:59.778]  Exactly.
[00:59:00.018 --> 00:59:00.978]  And that's kind of the same thing.
[00:59:00.998 --> 00:59:11.860]  We talk a lot with the cancer and how everyone wants to fight cancer and find the cure, but if they do, then that's billions of dollars that they're not going to continue to funnel into those
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:18.062]  Well, if I told you a secret, don't tell anybody, okay?
[00:59:21.003 --> 00:59:27.565]  And that is you can reduce your risk of breast cancer by 462% by cooking your meat medium rare rather than well done.
[00:59:28.646 --> 00:59:29.206]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:59:46.761 --> 00:59:50.422]  You eat your meat cooked medium-rare, you reduce it by 462%.
[00:59:50.902 --> 00:59:55.363]  You supplement with selenium, you actually reduce your risk of breast cancer by 82%.
[00:59:55.603 --> 01:00:06.504]  There's one of my lawsuits against the FDA, which I prevailed in federal court to be able to say that without fear of retribution from the government and being put in jail and so forth.
[01:00:06.965 --> 01:00:14.866]  I can say you can reduce your risk of cancer by many, many different types of cancer, including prostate cancer, colon cancer.
[01:00:15.766 --> 01:00:28.394]  We've done many studies in Manitoba University up in Canada and Clemson University in the United States on cell cultures in animals and now we're moving on to people because experiments in both cell cultures in human cells with cancer and animals.
[01:00:29.834 --> 01:00:31.295]  The results are so, so good.
[01:00:31.816 --> 01:00:33.917]  In some cases we can reduce the risk of cancer.
[01:00:34.337 --> 01:00:38.620]  We can kill cancer cells by 95% just with nutrient combinations.
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:39.160]  Right.
[01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:40.701]  And this is unheard of.
[01:00:40.981 --> 01:00:42.002]  Doctors say it's impossible.
[01:00:42.682 --> 01:00:46.124]  Well, you have to appreciate the average doctor in America lives to be 56.
[01:00:46.324 --> 01:00:49.146]  That's their own study, came out in 1999.
[01:00:49.847 --> 01:00:55.010]  And why would anybody want to listen to a group of people whose average lifespan is 56 and how to live to be 100?
[01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:55.831]  Exactly.
[01:00:56.071 --> 01:01:07.698]  I used to work for a doctor and that was one of my biggest complaints is that I knew more than he did about health and nutrition and his first go-to was just to give someone a prescription to something and I'm like, this is the Hippocratic Oath!
[01:01:07.819 --> 01:01:10.420]  What are you, why do you not understand nutrition?
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:11.241]  And what did he say?
[01:01:12.110 --> 01:01:15.632]  He just kind of, eventually he did start recommending yoga and things like that.
[01:01:15.792 --> 01:01:17.553]  Well, there's a lot of nutrition in yoga.
[01:01:18.754 --> 01:01:19.775]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:01:19.795 --> 01:01:21.536]  And there's no nutrition in yoga.
[01:01:22.416 --> 01:01:25.638]  Well, it does go to the parasympathetic nervous system.
[01:01:26.159 --> 01:01:27.760]  Well, it's mind, body, spirit, isn't it?
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:31.002]  But everybody always forgets the body piece, the 90 essential nutrients.
[01:01:31.042 --> 01:01:33.783]  They spend all their time doing yoga and being spiritual.
[01:01:34.084 --> 01:01:35.665]  And then go get McDonald's afterwards.
[01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:48.199]  Now, you get into the history of how the soil became depleted and these studies and how they've been suppressed and everything in your book, Epigenetics.
[01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:49.760]  What is epigenetics?
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:51.702]  Can you give me layman's terms?
[01:01:52.182 --> 01:01:52.583]  Okay, sure.
[01:01:52.603 --> 01:02:01.250]  Well, the term epigenetics is a one-word definition of the need for your genes, your DNA, and your RNA to have
[01:02:02.191 --> 01:02:05.212]  Um, catalysts and cofactors to maximize their potential.
[01:02:05.853 --> 01:02:14.116]  Again, it's like that car that can go 300,000 miles with oil in it and brake fluid and transmission fluid and coolant in the radiator.
[01:02:14.136 --> 01:02:20.438]  If you're missing any of those fluids, you reduce the life of that engine maybe by 50,000 miles or 10,000 miles.
[01:02:20.998 --> 01:02:26.681]  But if you did something really drastic by replacing the six quarts of oil in the crankcase with six quarts of water,
[01:02:27.521 --> 01:02:33.164]  Again, you might not get that car to go the distance that it would carry normally in one tank of gas, maybe 500 miles.
[01:02:33.184 --> 01:02:33.605]  It won't go.
[01:02:33.645 --> 01:02:34.825]  The engine will burn up before that.
[01:02:35.145 --> 01:02:38.147]  Put oil in there, it'll go 3,300,000 miles.
[01:02:38.167 --> 01:02:39.048]  Okay?
[01:02:39.668 --> 01:02:45.631]  And so, it's very exciting when you see all the results of
[01:02:47.199 --> 01:02:49.161]  Very expensive studies that back that up.
[01:02:49.481 --> 01:02:51.602]  The death of the genetic theory of disease transmission.
[01:02:52.163 --> 01:02:58.508]  Again, Leanne, you have to appreciate that over the thousands of years, the halls of science are filled with failed medical theories.
[01:02:59.676 --> 01:03:07.739]  Evil spirits, spontaneous generation, the four humors, if they're out of balance, do bloodletting to try and get everything back in balance.
[01:03:08.839 --> 01:03:10.059]  The cholesterol thing.
[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:11.760]  Cholesterol isn't causing disease.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:13.100]  Cholesterol is an essential nutrient.
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:14.861]  That whole thing on cholesterol.
[01:03:14.881 --> 01:03:18.602]  I spent 35 years, Leanne, looking for the paper that showed that cholesterol is dangerous.
[01:03:19.122 --> 01:03:20.303]  I spent 35 years looking for it.
[01:03:22.267 --> 01:03:26.972]  I finally found the paper, but what it said was, it was all an advertising campaign.
[01:03:26.992 --> 01:03:27.713]  There was no science.
[01:03:27.733 --> 01:03:28.934]  There was never any science behind it.
[01:03:29.315 --> 01:03:30.576]  Animal fat is the best thing for you.
[01:03:30.676 --> 01:03:31.657]  Butter, cream, lard.
[01:03:31.677 --> 01:03:33.619]  Yeah, that's on Time Magazine now.
[01:03:33.639 --> 01:03:34.480]  Eat more butter.
[01:03:34.741 --> 01:03:39.065]  When there was this whole, for over a decade, you know, the anti-fat movement.
[01:03:39.085 --> 01:03:41.088]  Now they're like, ah, eat some butter.
[01:03:41.568 --> 01:03:43.789]  Oh, a stick of butter a day keeps the doctor away.
[01:03:44.290 --> 01:03:48.012]  Hamburger day is like a day without a hamburger is like a day without sunshine.
[01:03:48.032 --> 01:03:50.073]  A pound of meat a day keeps the doctor away.
[01:03:50.753 --> 01:03:53.255]  And these are all failed medical theories.
[01:03:53.275 --> 01:03:56.897]  And they've killed millions and millions of people with these failed medical theories.
[01:03:57.417 --> 01:03:58.998]  Because the cancer rate's gone up.
[01:03:59.458 --> 01:04:01.940]  The death rate from heart disease has gone up.
[01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:10.765]  Because the medical system and the American Heart Association, Procter & Gamble, who made Crisco, which is originally a machinery oil from factories,
[01:04:11.385 --> 01:04:12.906]  Crisco was originally a machine oil.
[01:04:13.827 --> 01:04:15.408]  It was never designed to be a food.
[01:04:15.849 --> 01:04:20.793]  But they bought it and turned it into a food because they said, we can make more money selling it as a food than we could as a machine oil.
[01:04:21.393 --> 01:04:26.898]  It was originally designed as a machine oil by a Nazi sympathizer by the name of Wilhelm Norman.
[01:04:27.718 --> 01:04:36.746]  And they said, well, we have to come up with an ad campaign because mothers and grandmothers did not like to use Crisco because they liked lard and butter and cream.
[01:04:37.466 --> 01:04:49.709]  And so they went to the American Heart Association and said, look, we'll give you 1.7 million dollars if you endorse Crisco as a healthier fat than beef fat, pork fat, lard, cream and butter, and eggs.
[01:04:50.209 --> 01:04:50.989]  And they did.
[01:04:51.670 --> 01:05:05.073]  They prostituted themselves for 1.7 million dollars because before that they were a specialty without a disease because there was no heart disease in America until people started using oils and then we have heart disease which are caused by nutritional deficiencies in oils.
[01:05:05.478 --> 01:05:14.382]  Right, and you've got to just wonder how much money people were given to, say, artificial sweeteners are better, you know, than pure cane sugar or something like that.
[01:05:14.802 --> 01:05:15.943]  Or high fructose corn syrup.
[01:05:15.983 --> 01:05:18.204]  It's fine, here, use corn and everything.
[01:05:18.244 --> 01:05:19.864]  Well, it's all driven by money.
[01:05:19.884 --> 01:05:20.965]  I have no doubt about it.
[01:05:21.005 --> 01:05:22.586]  It's not driven by science and health.
[01:05:23.726 --> 01:05:31.230]  And, as you say, on the cover of Time Magazine, a big chunk of butter is saying, eat more butter.
[01:05:31.610 --> 01:05:33.891]  It's now known to be healthier than vegetable oils.
[01:05:34.813 --> 01:05:37.396]  It's the opposite of what doctors have been saying for 80 years.
[01:05:38.096 --> 01:05:39.558]  Somebody needs to go to jail here, Leigh Ann.
[01:05:39.881 --> 01:05:40.942]  Right, exactly.
[01:05:41.022 --> 01:05:42.563]  And who is behind all of this?
[01:05:42.643 --> 01:05:44.025]  And now why the sudden push?
[01:05:44.565 --> 01:05:52.092]  Because they're certainly not trying to, all of a sudden, make everyone healthy and do away with the healthcare industry.
[01:05:52.112 --> 01:06:06.725]  Well, I think what's happened is, and I may be sort of bragging to myself too much, but for 35 years I've been hammering on them with the Dead Doctors Don't Lie books and things, and I imagine they went and looked and did the studies to try and refute what I was beating up on them.
[01:06:07.705 --> 01:06:09.546]  With the dead Dr. Lai concept.
[01:06:10.226 --> 01:06:12.427]  And they said, oh my gosh, Wallach's right.
[01:06:12.467 --> 01:06:14.188]  Well, I actually published that in 1971.
[01:06:14.788 --> 01:06:21.871]  I compared the percentage of blockage in coronary arteries and heart arteries in vegetarians, vegans and meat eaters.
[01:06:21.891 --> 01:06:26.413]  They use special stains that show saturated fat, cholesterol in the arteries and so forth.
[01:06:26.813 --> 01:06:32.415]  Published it in an international pathology journal in Acta Pathologica, which is from Denmark, back in 1971.
[01:06:34.677 --> 01:06:36.999]  And guess who had the worst plugged arteries?
[01:06:37.319 --> 01:06:37.879]  Vegans.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:38.900]  Really?
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:42.202]  Vegetarians that don't eat any animal, don't even eat eggs or dairy.
[01:06:42.562 --> 01:06:43.003]  Vegans.
[01:06:43.843 --> 01:06:45.765]  And that's because they eat stored grains.
[01:06:46.165 --> 01:06:49.067]  What happens to the wheat germ oil when you store it for a year?
[01:06:49.227 --> 01:06:52.209]  It oxidizes and turns into trans fatty acids, blocks your arteries with inflammation, causes cancer.
[01:06:52.229 --> 01:07:04.437]  And then they stir fry everything in extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, extra, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin, virgin,
[01:07:04.637 --> 01:07:06.119]  And cause cancer in your arteries.
[01:07:07.081 --> 01:07:09.264]  Trendier the more extra virgin.
[01:07:09.304 --> 01:07:09.865]  Exactly.
[01:07:10.125 --> 01:07:11.047]  Well that's the problem.
[01:07:11.648 --> 01:07:18.378]  And so they've actually killed more people than the Nazis did during the Second World War with these vegetable oils.
[01:07:19.139 --> 01:07:19.840]  Absolutely criminal.
[01:07:20.728 --> 01:07:28.551]  Yeah, and I was actually just reading today that it's the oils and the wheats and these toxins in the food that causes all this disease in the gut.
[01:07:29.152 --> 01:07:34.494]  And that, again, going back to Hippocrates, that's where the disease all begins.
[01:07:35.154 --> 01:07:36.395]  It always begins in the colon.
[01:07:36.635 --> 01:07:36.855]  Right.
[01:07:37.475 --> 01:07:40.856]  And that's where the gluten intolerance comes in, because it's all in the intestine of the colon.
[01:07:41.277 --> 01:07:46.118]  And again, the story of all these things is in the book, Epigenetics, so that people get the history.
[01:07:46.579 --> 01:07:48.079]  You have to understand the progression.
[01:07:48.099 --> 01:07:55.202]  And again, the halls of science, Leanne, are filled with failed, thousands and thousands of failed medical theories.
[01:07:56.242 --> 01:07:57.863]  And the cholesterol one is just another one.
[01:07:58.154 --> 01:08:02.997]  Well, you break it all down in this book, and it's, I mean, the way you explain it, it's all so simple.
[01:08:03.017 --> 01:08:05.499]  It seems like it would be such a simple fix.
[01:08:06.379 --> 01:08:09.461]  Here we've done a lot of damage, but we really can turn it all around.
[01:08:09.561 --> 01:08:13.063]  It is a simple fix, and of course, it was designed to be an ad campaign.
[01:08:16.912 --> 01:08:29.342]  Procter & Gamble paid the American Heart Association $1.7 million to endorse Crisco as a healthier cooking sharpening than butter and cream and lard that people have been using for thousands of years.
[01:08:29.462 --> 01:08:29.923]  Exactly.
[01:08:29.963 --> 01:08:31.124]  There was never any science.
[01:08:31.164 --> 01:08:37.409]  There was never... I looked for it for 35 years and I couldn't figure out why couldn't I find the science because it was an ad campaign.
[01:08:37.869 --> 01:08:38.910]  We finally figured it out.
[01:08:39.755 --> 01:08:41.196]  Right, well that's what this whole thing is.
[01:08:41.216 --> 01:08:44.138]  It's just tricking everyone into buying this and saying, no!
[01:08:44.658 --> 01:08:47.881]  Cancer and heart disease and all these things, they've always been around.
[01:08:47.921 --> 01:08:50.803]  People have always been dying from these things in these record numbers.
[01:08:51.403 --> 01:08:53.384]  You know, the whole gaslighting campaign.
[01:08:53.885 --> 01:08:55.726]  Well, thank you so much for breaking it down.
[01:08:55.746 --> 01:09:01.270]  I know this book really has a lot of extensive research and it is quite an easy thing for people.
[01:09:01.290 --> 01:09:04.292]  Just do a little research and we can turn this whole thing around.
[01:09:04.752 --> 01:09:08.435]  So thank you for all of the work that you're doing and we'll have you back soon, Doc.
[01:09:08.736 --> 01:09:09.871]  Thanks for your hospitality, Leanne.
[01:09:11.670 --> 01:09:13.211]  Well, I've heard it's a great book.
[01:09:13.291 --> 01:09:14.812]  I can't wait to read it myself.
[01:09:15.112 --> 01:09:16.513]  And knowledge is power.
[01:09:16.633 --> 01:09:21.035]  Now I know I need to start doing a daily supplement along with my healthy diet.
[01:09:21.416 --> 01:09:28.200]  Now you can pick up those 90 essential vitamins and minerals that Doc Wallach was speaking about at InfoWarsHealth.com.
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:30.661]  It's in a lot of the products that are there.
[01:09:31.041 --> 01:09:31.982]  Just do a little research.
[01:09:32.002 --> 01:09:38.766]  You can always pick up the Alex Pack 2.0 and that'll have the 90 essential vitamins and minerals that we need
[01:09:39.266 --> 01:09:41.970]  So we can all look as good as the Doc when we hit our 70s.
