[00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.594]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:00:04.335 --> 00:00:07.539]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:14.622 --> 00:00:15.243]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.923 --> 00:00:16.964]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.705 --> 00:00:18.806]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.447 --> 00:00:20.267]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.048 --> 00:00:21.929]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.213]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.774 --> 00:00:30.838]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:47.324 --> 00:00:50.487]  Here we are, another Friday lays out before us.
[00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:53.890]  Thank you so much for joining us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:54.931 --> 00:01:02.277]  It is, of course, already the 21st day of March 2014.
[00:01:03.057 --> 00:01:07.501]  We will have open phones throughout the transmission today.
[00:01:08.102 --> 00:01:12.165]  Fiery, controversial member of the UK Parliament, George Galloway,
[00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:17.168]  ...is scheduled to be joining us to talk about Ukraine, the Middle East...
[00:01:18.435 --> 00:01:21.316]  Prosecuting Tony Blair for war crimes and more.
[00:01:21.896 --> 00:01:23.677]  He's going to be joining us.
[00:01:23.697 --> 00:01:27.578]  And then we have UKIP, the Nationalist Libertarians on.
[00:01:27.618 --> 00:01:32.560]  Then we have George Galloway, who kind of represents what I would call more actual liberals.
[00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:35.721]  Not the authoritarian type liberal, but an actual liberal.
[00:01:36.602 --> 00:01:45.425]  Joining us from the other side of the opposition spectrum, against all of the establishment people that are in the middle, pushing the status quo of accelerated tyranny and oppression.
[00:01:47.193 --> 00:01:52.634]  So we will be taking your phone calls, as I said, and covering a ton of news.
[00:01:53.135 --> 00:01:54.015]  Wow, where to start?
[00:01:54.055 --> 00:02:00.836]  We've got a bunch on Obamacare as it continues to unravel and Obama goes on these big news blitzes to push it.
[00:02:01.997 --> 00:02:06.978]  We're going to be looking at a really serious report about more and more drug resistant
[00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.452]  strains of bacteria in this country.
[00:02:11.412 --> 00:02:17.397]  I personally have had multiple family members die from drug-resistant bacteria this year and lung infections.
[00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:31.389]  I personally have known other people who've lost family members, and I know folks who've been on antibiotics for three, four months, different types, who cannot get rid of the chest infections that have been going around.
[00:02:32.438 --> 00:02:33.839]  And this is happening all over the country.
[00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:34.940]  I've talked to medical doctors.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.561]  They call it the mystery illness.
[00:02:37.502 --> 00:02:46.529]  They've been trying to basically keep it quiet from national news that it's going on, but it's a very serious situation.
[00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.772]  It's a whole bunch of different drug-resistant bacteria.
[00:02:50.433 --> 00:02:55.837]  A bunch of streps, a bunch of staph, other types of bacteria, and we've got a list of them here.
[00:02:56.337 --> 00:03:00.601]  We're gonna be talking about that because the antibiotics, more and more, just aren't working.
[00:03:02.278 --> 00:03:04.139]  Well, the antibiotics make you have kidney failure.
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.982]  And it says on the inserts, you know, screw up your kidneys, but people don't have a choice.
[00:03:10.842 --> 00:03:13.824]  So, it's becoming serious Russian roulette.
[00:03:13.864 --> 00:03:19.007]  I mean, you've got to take poison so strong to kill these bacteria that it kills your kidneys.
[00:03:21.068 --> 00:03:25.590]  And people are putting kids on antibiotics for no reason for 50, 60 years.
[00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.131]  Don't even test to see if it's viral.
[00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:29.032]  They just throw them on the antibiotics.
[00:03:30.193 --> 00:03:30.573]  And now,
[00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:34.880]  We are all going to pay the piper.
[00:03:35.941 --> 00:03:36.381]  Big time.
[00:03:37.362 --> 00:03:55.712]  And governments predict it could kill hundreds of millions when some really drug-immune bacteria shows up, that it will just go through the population and basically, like a slow motion disintegrator ray, basically flesh-eat everybody it comes in contact with.
[00:03:56.013 --> 00:03:57.693]  We're already seeing a lot of this pop up.
[00:03:57.754 --> 00:04:01.716]  I mean, boy, I tell you, the folks that got to work in hospitals, I feel sorry for them.
[00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:14.634]  And more and more you're seeing the elite go to private clinics that have all sorts of advanced medical care in them that are very high dollar, so that they don't have to be around the unwashed masses.
[00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:16.775]  And quite frankly, that's the way to go.
[00:04:18.055 --> 00:04:23.238]  That's what you want to do now, if you've got the money, because it's that dangerous.
[00:04:24.218 --> 00:04:33.002]  And all over the third world, the system is just pumping antibiotics out over the counter,
[00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.694]  And the bacteria are becoming immune, just like bugs become resistant and immune to pesticide.
[00:04:41.775 --> 00:04:47.179]  And it is creating a cocktail that I think is one of the biggest threats to humanity.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.500]  You throw in GMO.
[00:04:50.615 --> 00:04:54.217]  And all the toxic waste dumping and the rest of it, it is a nasty combination.
[00:04:55.177 --> 00:05:01.200]  Alright, I'm gonna get to the main transmission, our top stories, straight ahead and then I'll give the phone number out on this Friday edition.
[00:05:01.621 --> 00:05:03.842]  I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:05:03.902 --> 00:05:04.342]  Central.
[00:05:04.362 --> 00:05:05.823]  4 to 6 p.m.
[00:05:06.383 --> 00:05:08.004]  Central Standard Time on the Sunday edition.
[00:05:09.767 --> 00:05:10.607]  The facts are in.
[00:05:10.788 --> 00:05:11.908]  The studies are legion.
[00:05:12.188 --> 00:05:19.492]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:05:19.692 --> 00:05:23.174]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:05:23.514 --> 00:05:23.935]  Simple.
[00:05:24.095 --> 00:05:28.517]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:05:28.817 --> 00:05:34.260]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.905]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
[00:05:40.065 --> 00:05:50.534]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:05:50.854 --> 00:05:55.097]  Let's take a stand against the globalists by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[00:05:55.418 --> 00:05:57.279]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:02.884]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[00:06:03.144 --> 00:06:07.407]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[00:06:07.547 --> 00:06:09.429]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.251]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:06:12.511 --> 00:06:15.734]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots
[00:06:15.894 --> 00:06:17.356]  Over at My Patriot Supply.
[00:06:17.616 --> 00:06:25.507]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:06:25.747 --> 00:06:30.053]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:06:30.293 --> 00:06:34.098]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:06:34.238 --> 00:06:39.942]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:06:40.182 --> 00:06:42.964]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:06:43.344 --> 00:06:48.568]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:06:48.728 --> 00:06:56.754]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[00:07:00.336 --> 00:07:03.218]  That's 866-229-0927.

[00:07:06.061 --> 00:07:08.803]  Buypatriotsupply.com slash Alex.
[00:07:09.263 --> 00:07:14.868]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:07:15.048 --> 00:07:22.294]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:07:22.434 --> 00:07:25.617]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:07:25.777 --> 00:07:27.578]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:07:27.818 --> 00:07:32.401]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:35.223]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:07:35.383 --> 00:07:41.166]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:07:41.346 --> 00:07:44.808]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[00:07:45.008 --> 00:07:50.071]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:52.913]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:59.359]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.461]  Survival Shield Nascent Iodine.
[00:08:01.621 --> 00:08:07.047]  Secure your super high quality Nascent Iodine today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:08:07.147 --> 00:08:08.508]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:08:12.918 --> 00:08:15.620]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.901]  Let me think, just let me think.
[00:08:16.921 --> 00:08:22.465]  I suspect even now, orders are being shouts into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[00:08:22.485 --> 00:08:24.066]  It's Chancellor Settler.
[00:08:24.146 --> 00:08:24.466]  Damn it!
[00:08:24.506 --> 00:08:24.786]  Why?
[00:08:25.587 --> 00:08:31.571]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:08:32.191 --> 00:08:35.534]  Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen, the
[00:08:37.501 --> 00:08:42.923]  But the truth is, sir, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:08:42.963 --> 00:08:43.924]  You decided, sir.
[00:08:43.984 --> 00:08:44.904]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:46.305]  You taught me every television in London!
[00:08:46.585 --> 00:08:48.646]  Cruelty and injustice.
[00:08:48.686 --> 00:08:50.067]  Intolerance and oppression.
[00:08:50.487 --> 00:08:59.811]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and subverting your...
[00:09:00.151 --> 00:09:00.972]  We need cameras.
[00:09:16.169 --> 00:09:17.590]  I know why you did it.
[00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:19.232]  I know you were afraid.
[00:09:19.652 --> 00:09:21.393]  Who wouldn't be?
[00:09:21.413 --> 00:09:21.493]  War?
[00:09:21.654 --> 00:09:22.074]  Terror?
[00:09:22.294 --> 00:09:22.915]  Disease?
[00:09:23.575 --> 00:09:29.960]  There were a myriad of properties conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:35.805]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:09:36.445 --> 00:09:42.570]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:09:49.315 --> 00:09:50.517]  There is a war.
[00:09:50.997 --> 00:09:51.978]  It's happening now.
[00:09:52.879 --> 00:09:54.681]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:09:55.242 --> 00:09:57.024]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:09:57.825 --> 00:09:59.287]  We are the Resistance.
[00:09:59.727 --> 00:10:01.329]  We are the Infowar.
[00:10:05.276 --> 00:10:26.368]  And we have chosen liberty, we have chosen due process, we have chosen the way of our ancestors, the Bill of Rights and Constitution, the true revolutionary idea of human freedom, the great expression of the Bible and European and British common law, and the Magna Carta, and the flower of the Renaissance.
[00:10:26.568 --> 00:10:30.830]  We want the latest, newest, proven best system.
[00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:34.012]  We want our Republic back, and we want it right now.
[00:10:35.267 --> 00:10:45.512]  We are not going to stand by and watch the globalists create crony, centralized, monopoly capitalism and blame free market capitalism for what their system has done.
[00:10:45.552 --> 00:10:51.535]  We're not going to sit back and watch the police being federalized, militarized, and have that blamed on the Republic.
[00:10:52.475 --> 00:10:53.796]  Or even on the police themselves.
[00:10:54.136 --> 00:11:00.599]  We're going to blame it on the RAND Corporation and the globalists that are incrementally engineering our country into a police state.
[00:11:01.988 --> 00:11:11.051]  We're not going to blame the poor starving immigrants that pour across our borders from globalist destroyed nations for the destruction of our wages.
[00:11:12.751 --> 00:11:17.372]  We're going to blame the globalists that created the atmosphere to allow this to happen.
[00:11:19.473 --> 00:11:25.995]  We're not going to blame the average mainline street liberal that's scared of guns and really thinks they're dangerous and wants to save people.
[00:11:28.601 --> 00:11:32.643]  And who doesn't understand that guns protect people many more times a day than they hurt people.
[00:11:34.564 --> 00:11:35.785]  We're going to deprogram them.
[00:11:36.065 --> 00:11:41.968]  We don't want to fight with the average dumbed-down person, the average zombie who's been brainwashed since birth.
[00:11:42.408 --> 00:11:48.551]  We want to reach out to them and wake them up and show them the hat trick, show them the magician scam.
[00:11:50.163 --> 00:11:51.163]  We want unity.
[00:11:51.203 --> 00:11:53.064]  We want to bring humanity together.
[00:11:53.184 --> 00:11:57.305]  Rand Paul, two days ago, gave an extremely powerful 30-minute speech at Berkeley.
[00:11:57.705 --> 00:12:01.726]  We heard the whole thing on the nightly news last night in extended coverage.
[00:12:02.126 --> 00:12:04.667]  We heard excerpts yesterday here on the radio show.
[00:12:05.847 --> 00:12:17.030]  And he said, whether you're black or white, old or young, conservative, libertarian, liberal, you shouldn't want the NSA to be illegally spying on you.
[00:12:20.947 --> 00:12:22.608]  Who watches the Watchers?
[00:12:23.549 --> 00:12:39.723]  We are all unified in the fact that our rights are being universally abused and we should come together based on freedom and have that be the unifying cultural more.
[00:12:43.506 --> 00:12:46.809]  MSNBC predictably went into conniption fits.
[00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:47.990]  We're going to play a clip of this later.
[00:12:49.363 --> 00:12:57.871]  with Al Sharpton so angry that he couldn't even get his name right and called him Ron Paul and said that Rand Paul wanted to get rid of the
[00:13:01.061 --> 00:13:04.004]  Civil rights movement and different acts that were brought in.
[00:13:04.424 --> 00:13:13.373]  No, Rand Paul pointed out that we replaced one evil with another form of discrimination just like many black leaders I've had on have done.
[00:13:13.734 --> 00:13:14.374]  That's the point.
[00:13:14.414 --> 00:13:17.417]  It isn't endorsing the previous system and he was clear in that.
[00:13:17.878 --> 00:13:23.684]  He was saying we replaced one evil with another evil and everybody who actually studies these facts knows that.
[00:13:24.364 --> 00:13:39.715]  But this is the type of division because if we ever come together around private property, family, the Second Amendment, the right to practice religion as we see fit or not to practice it, the right to live as we see fit, as long as it doesn't hurt someone else, our bodies are ours.
[00:13:41.096 --> 00:13:48.662]  Because any control freak movement from the left or the right will only end up getting distorted and used to oppress and to selectively enforce.
[00:13:49.022 --> 00:13:51.004]  That doesn't mean we endorse
[00:13:52.097 --> 00:13:52.957]  Using hard drugs.
[00:13:53.498 --> 00:13:57.039]  It doesn't mean you endorse someone's sexual activity.
[00:13:57.779 --> 00:14:03.121]  It means you don't want them in your life and you respect them enough to stay out of their life.
[00:14:04.142 --> 00:14:11.725]  That doesn't mean, though, you then let them recruit five-year-olds in the public schools and promote different activities, because that's pedophilia.
[00:14:13.174 --> 00:14:17.896]  So it all is a balance, but we need to go back to common sense and realize that we're under social engineering.
[00:14:17.916 --> 00:14:21.037]  The reason I raise that out of all the stories I've got, look how crazy this one is.
[00:14:21.838 --> 00:14:23.878]  I reported this years ago and people didn't believe me.
[00:14:25.659 --> 00:14:34.543]  Just like it was in the Associated Press years ago that a million plus state employees in California, they got a million state employees, folks.
[00:14:34.863 --> 00:14:35.143]  Plus.
[00:14:36.752 --> 00:14:44.958]  It was in the San Francisco Chronicle, first time I saw it, like 10 years ago, it was 900 and something thousand were exempt, and last time I saw it in AP, it was over a million were exempt.
[00:14:46.819 --> 00:14:56.846]  And that's just in California, it's all over the country, where they're allowed to run red lights, the red light cameras can't even scan their plates, their plates are blocked, the lysis plate scanners can't read them.
[00:14:58.367 --> 00:14:59.147]  They're above the law.
[00:15:00.508 --> 00:15:04.051]  In the name of security, so people can't look in the database and find out where they live.
[00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:05.991]  Well, how about my security?
[00:15:06.011 --> 00:15:07.711]  How about I'm not in all these databases?
[00:15:09.272 --> 00:15:09.552]  L.A.
[00:15:09.592 --> 00:15:12.574]  just got caught using the license plate readers to track everybody in the state.
[00:15:13.474 --> 00:15:15.215]  It first broke in L.A., but it's the whole state.
[00:15:15.575 --> 00:15:18.556]  And the state police said, well, everyone is a suspect.
[00:15:18.596 --> 00:15:20.997]  That was the headline yesterday in California.
[00:15:21.758 --> 00:15:25.640]  No judge, no jury, no probable cause, no reasonable suspicion, no nothing.
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:31.302]  You're not running out of bank with a mask on your head and a bag of money in your hand and a gun in the other hand.
[00:15:31.622 --> 00:15:32.703]  That's probable cause to
[00:15:34.424 --> 00:15:37.106]  Draw a bead on the person and say, stop or I'll shoot.
[00:15:37.126 --> 00:15:39.107]  I don't care if you're a citizen or a cop.
[00:15:39.127 --> 00:15:40.148]  If they don't stop, shoot them.
[00:15:41.288 --> 00:15:43.710]  Cops just have the power of citizen's arrest just like we do.
[00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.832]  They're just sworn and bonded and professionally work for us.
[00:15:47.452 --> 00:15:50.274]  But there's no probable cause.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:57.142]  To just say, all of you are suspects, but that's what L.A.
[00:15:57.182 --> 00:15:59.423]  and then the state police came out and said yesterday.
[00:16:00.023 --> 00:16:02.784]  They said, every one of you is a suspect.
[00:16:03.165 --> 00:16:04.525]  Well, how about you're a suspect?
[00:16:04.625 --> 00:16:10.748]  Government, historically, is a suspect of dominating and abuse and killing more people than any other system.
[00:16:11.696 --> 00:16:12.297]  Democide.
[00:16:13.037 --> 00:16:20.604]  Doesn't mean we're saying you're guilty, but it means historically you are the plague, you are the danger, and that's what our founders stated, and it's true.
[00:16:21.144 --> 00:16:25.728]  Now, speaking of the next article, this is out of AP again, if you're a radio listener, I'm not joking.
[00:16:25.748 --> 00:16:31.433]  Because I've mentioned this before as an example of tyranny, and people don't believe me because it's so over the top.
[00:16:32.474 --> 00:16:33.414]  Let me read this to you right now.
[00:16:34.455 --> 00:16:37.578]  Hawaii law lets police have sex with prostitutes.
[00:16:39.585 --> 00:16:40.345]  Honolulu.
[00:16:40.605 --> 00:16:50.749]  Honolulu police officers have urged lawmakers to keep an exemption in state law that allows undercover officers to have sex with prostitutes during investigations touching off a heated debate.
[00:16:51.889 --> 00:16:55.770]  Authorities say they need the legal protection to catch lawbreakers in the act.
[00:16:56.371 --> 00:16:57.111]  Yeah, right.
[00:16:57.851 --> 00:17:06.574]  Critics, including human trafficking experts and other police, say it's unnecessary and could further victimize sex workers, many of whom have been forced into the trade.
[00:17:08.783 --> 00:17:14.706]  Police haven't said how often or even if they use the provision, and they ask legislators to preserve it.
[00:17:14.986 --> 00:17:28.973]  Folks, let me tell you, just studying news and criminology for 20 years, who usually operates as the master pimps over prostitutes in big cities, in Serpico's, Expos' and others, is the police.
[00:17:29.373 --> 00:17:30.113]  And I'll tell you why.
[00:17:30.153 --> 00:17:31.754]  The police like to have sex with the women.
[00:17:33.075 --> 00:17:34.936]  I don't need to give you a little newsflash here, and
[00:17:37.904 --> 00:17:40.547]  This is so they can basically run the prostitutes.
[00:17:41.768 --> 00:17:44.171]  The ones that have been forced into it in many cases.
[00:17:45.272 --> 00:17:48.696]  I am for decriminalization of prostitution.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.723]  And it's not because I endorse the breadth and width of the trade.
[00:17:54.344 --> 00:17:56.165]  Keeping it illegal, just like the drug war.
[00:17:56.185 --> 00:17:56.946]  This is not my opinion.
[00:17:57.226 --> 00:17:58.507]  It's absolute fact.
[00:17:59.368 --> 00:18:01.369]  Allows women to be kept in captivity.
[00:18:01.509 --> 00:18:02.730]  Allows it to stay illegal.
[00:18:02.851 --> 00:18:10.797]  Allows to keep the prices sky high for the system and the banks that wanted the money to control the trade and the traffic.
[00:18:12.218 --> 00:18:12.859]  You understand that?
[00:18:13.339 --> 00:18:16.061]  Sex slavery should be life in prison, folks.
[00:18:16.081 --> 00:18:16.622]  But they don't.
[00:18:16.842 --> 00:18:17.803]  They allow it to operate.
[00:18:19.636 --> 00:18:28.838]  And then, meanwhile, you've got the high-end whole escort situation that the government wants to keep illegal just so they can extort payoffs in the major cities.
[00:18:29.779 --> 00:18:31.839]  And Europe, in many areas, is decriminalized.
[00:18:31.899 --> 00:18:33.660]  It actually makes prostitution go down.
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.020]  It cleans it up.
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.761]  This has been going on forever.
[00:18:36.901 --> 00:18:38.281]  It's going to continue to go on forever.
[00:18:38.621 --> 00:18:42.402]  And all we do is let the government come in and run the stinking thing.
[00:18:44.503 --> 00:18:45.863]  So, hey, I got an idea, police.
[00:18:46.263 --> 00:18:48.564]  How about we get you out of the prostitution racket
[00:18:49.491 --> 00:18:51.591]  And how about we say everybody's exempt, huh?
[00:18:52.792 --> 00:18:53.252]  How about that?
[00:18:54.952 --> 00:18:56.993]  I mean, it's such common sense.
[00:18:57.593 --> 00:19:03.514]  I mean, what, are you going to say taking a woman out to dinner or giving her some money is a prostitution?
[00:19:03.554 --> 00:19:05.094]  I mean, what's next, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:19:06.355 --> 00:19:06.715]  What's next?
[00:19:06.755 --> 00:19:12.796]  I mean, I see downtown all these older women that are out there with young boy toys, who I guarantee you they're paying for his rent.
[00:19:13.456 --> 00:19:14.956]  I guarantee you they're paying for his car.
[00:19:15.837 --> 00:19:17.277]  In fact, I've talked to these people.
[00:19:17.317 --> 00:19:17.677]  They are!
[00:19:18.792 --> 00:19:22.874]  I talk to these people I've seen before and I go, hey man, I've seen you with that lady.
[00:19:23.494 --> 00:19:25.395]  Are you her, basically, male mistress?
[00:19:25.555 --> 00:19:26.396]  Well, yeah, yeah.
[00:19:26.716 --> 00:19:27.416]  She takes care of me.
[00:19:27.436 --> 00:19:30.998]  I mean, you see a 60-year-old woman with a 25-year-old bodybuilder, folks?
[00:19:31.298 --> 00:19:32.879]  He's a gigolo, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:33.159 --> 00:19:34.140]  But it's all legal!
[00:19:35.666 --> 00:19:36.867]  She's the sugar mama.
[00:19:38.208 --> 00:19:41.870]  Listen, stop letting the government criminalize human activity.
[00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:51.597]  You can sit there and moralize about it all day long, and I do as well, but government involvement only makes it dirtier, more secret, more corrupt.
[00:19:53.438 --> 00:19:58.761]  The Hawaiian police, folks, let me give you a little newsflash, McGarrett and all the rest of them, that doesn't exist.
[00:19:59.761 --> 00:20:01.606]  They bring major sex slaves through Hawaii.
[00:20:01.666 --> 00:20:03.832]  It's a major hub, just like England is.
[00:20:04.273 --> 00:20:07.020]  And folks, they are definitely getting high on their own supply.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:07.923]  Stay with us.
[00:20:07.943 --> 00:20:08.504]  We'll be right back.

[00:21:09.755 --> 00:21:10.155]  Hi there.
[00:21:10.755 --> 00:21:11.815]  My name is Frank Bates.
[00:21:12.296 --> 00:21:15.496]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[00:21:16.096 --> 00:21:24.878]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[00:21:25.258 --> 00:21:31.279]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[00:21:31.959 --> 00:21:33.540]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:39.221]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[00:21:39.961 --> 00:21:47.044]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[00:21:47.904 --> 00:21:52.806]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[00:21:53.486 --> 00:21:59.368]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.

[00:22:05.691 --> 00:22:06.811]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[00:22:09.032 --> 00:22:14.254]  Imagine a world where a surveillance device exists in every home in America.
[00:22:14.774 --> 00:22:15.754]  On every person.
[00:22:16.415 --> 00:22:20.836]  And it's accessible by anyone with freely downloadable software on the internet.
[00:22:21.276 --> 00:22:25.218]  From government and business competitors to thieves and abusive spouses.
[00:22:25.778 --> 00:22:26.758]  Sound far-fetched?
[00:22:27.218 --> 00:22:28.819]  It's happening right now.
[00:22:29.359 --> 00:22:30.600]  Big Brother is listening.
[00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:31.920]  Target is on the move.
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:32.780]  Watching.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.321]  Cell phone signal acquired.
[00:22:34.921 --> 00:22:37.023]  Using your cell phone to spy on you.
[00:22:37.043 --> 00:22:38.764]  Tracking GPS coordinates.
[00:22:39.125 --> 00:22:40.986]  Even when you think you've turned it off.
[00:22:41.406 --> 00:22:43.008]  Recording audio visual data now.

[00:23:08.317 --> 00:23:10.878]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:23:11.139 --> 00:23:16.001]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:23:16.261 --> 00:23:24.145]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:23:24.386 --> 00:23:28.688]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:23:28.908 --> 00:23:32.710]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:38.574]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:23:38.814 --> 00:23:41.596]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:23:41.997 --> 00:23:47.200]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[00:24:21.229 --> 00:24:25.950]  We're going to break down what Nancy Pelosi's up to right now with Obamacare and more.
[00:24:26.971 --> 00:24:32.913]  We're going to look at attempts to violate conservatives and libertarians First Amendment in this country here in just a moment.
[00:24:34.133 --> 00:24:40.455]  We're also going to get into the latest on Crimea, Iran ship off the US coast.
[00:24:41.751 --> 00:24:46.453]  Also, we're going to look at chewing gum sales are way down because people don't want to eat aspartame.
[00:24:46.513 --> 00:24:50.195]  It's been added to almost every over-the-counter bubble gum over-the-counter.
[00:24:50.215 --> 00:24:54.297]  You've got to order bubble gum or gum that doesn't have aspartame pretty much now.
[00:24:54.357 --> 00:24:56.598]  It's almost impossible to find it in stores.
[00:24:56.758 --> 00:24:57.959]  All of that is coming up.
[00:24:58.339 --> 00:25:00.960]  Oh, did you hear there's a Malaysian airline missing?
[00:25:03.319 --> 00:25:04.539]  That's what my mother told me last night.
[00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:05.760]  I hadn't seen him in about two weeks.
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.940]  And I went over there and visited him with my children.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.821]  And my mom said, have you heard there's a missing Malaysian airliner?
[00:25:11.861 --> 00:25:12.761]  As a joke, of course.
[00:25:13.982 --> 00:25:16.902]  He would think the only thing going on on this planet is that.
[00:25:17.062 --> 00:25:21.503]  Australia says suspected plane debris may have sunk out in the Pacific Ocean.
[00:25:21.744 --> 00:25:23.324]  Look, satellite, there's some debris.
[00:25:23.824 --> 00:25:26.965]  The Pacific has debris fields the size of Texas floating around.
[00:25:27.245 --> 00:25:27.585]  Literally.
[00:25:28.843 --> 00:25:29.924]  I mean, this is just ridiculous.
[00:25:30.564 --> 00:25:37.389]  And now the Malaysian Airlines debris hunt, India turns down China's request to enter its waters to prevent sniffing around.
[00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:39.151]  None of these governments trust each other.
[00:25:39.411 --> 00:25:41.272]  But we're all supposed to trust our government, we're told.
[00:25:42.253 --> 00:25:43.694]  Even though George Washington said, don't.
[00:25:44.495 --> 00:25:55.663]  It's a dangerous servant and a fearful master, but you need to listen to that guy, who single-handedly, militarily led the recruitment of the generals and
[00:25:56.926 --> 00:26:01.189]  General Staff and German commanders and others that helped defeat an empire that never been stopped.
[00:26:03.771 --> 00:26:04.411]  Don't listen to him.
[00:26:04.431 --> 00:26:06.792]  The guy that turned out being king.
[00:26:06.853 --> 00:26:07.853]  Just listen to Obama.
[00:26:08.213 --> 00:26:11.676]  He says, there are voices out there continually saying tyranny's right around the corner.
[00:26:12.296 --> 00:26:13.457]  Do not listen to those voices.
[00:26:13.897 --> 00:26:15.098]  Government's a force of good.
[00:26:16.779 --> 00:26:18.560]  And that's what Ellen DeGeneres said.
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:19.561]  We played the clip yesterday.
[00:26:19.601 --> 00:26:20.962]  She said, Obama!
[00:26:20.982 --> 00:26:25.465]  We need to all be thankful for what you gave us in Obamacare.
[00:26:26.573 --> 00:26:27.794]  And everyone loves it!
[00:26:30.896 --> 00:26:37.141]  You mean everyone in the 18, 17, 16 percent, depending on the poll that support it still?
[00:26:38.082 --> 00:26:39.803]  80 plus percent conservatively are against it?
[00:26:41.804 --> 00:26:45.007]  So everyone in the 15, 16, 17 percent, 18 percent?
[00:26:45.547 --> 00:26:48.129]  You mean as in a small minority supports it?
[00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:51.972]  But you just keep the wall of fraud.
[00:26:51.992 --> 00:26:54.054]  I was watching TV again this morning, flipping through channels.
[00:26:55.185 --> 00:27:04.231]  And it was just Obama on this entertainment show and that entertainment show and he was on ESPN again and it's just all up there about how he's a friendly guy that smiles at us.
[00:27:05.772 --> 00:27:06.853]  Gonna give you something free.
[00:27:07.193 --> 00:27:08.274]  He's got free candy.
[00:27:08.674 --> 00:27:09.535]  Just get in the van.
[00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:14.312]  I mean, what a discredited group of scum.
[00:27:14.972 --> 00:27:17.114]  I want to hear from you on all these subjects and more.
[00:27:17.154 --> 00:27:18.175]  It's wide open phones.
[00:27:18.615 --> 00:27:20.616]  I'm giving each caller one minute when we come back.
[00:27:20.656 --> 00:27:25.840]  We did this last week, or I guess earlier this week, too, and it really worked out well.
[00:27:26.461 --> 00:27:29.443]  It took a lot of calls.
[00:27:29.463 --> 00:27:29.703]  800-259-9231.
[00:27:30.183 --> 00:27:32.625]  All I ask is you get to your point on your phone and have good audio.
[00:27:33.166 --> 00:27:36.208]  We don't screen your calls unless I'm covering a certain topic.
[00:27:36.568 --> 00:27:37.969]  But we're not asking you to be on any topic.
[00:27:38.009 --> 00:27:38.650]  It's a free-for-all.
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:40.560]  800-259-9231.
[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:41.600]  800-259-9231.
[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:51.063]  And when you hear one caller hang up, that's your chance to call in.
[00:27:52.583 --> 00:27:55.064]  By the way, this story, we have a news piece about it.
[00:27:55.544 --> 00:27:56.965]  It's up on DrugsReport.com.
[00:27:57.585 --> 00:28:02.146]  New York trains to install audio video recorders.
[00:28:04.031 --> 00:28:07.756]  And the reason I raise this, I actually took a screenshot of it off of YouTube this morning.
[00:28:07.796 --> 00:28:13.162]  I need to go back to the YouTube video from my breakdown of it yesterday.
[00:28:16.186 --> 00:28:22.974]  We posted a Fox News piece on the website where old people that get Obamacare or Medicare or Medicaid
[00:28:23.993 --> 00:28:31.275]  Or basically anybody that goes on any type of assistance now, they're going to put sensors all over your house that track everything you do and tie into the smart meters.
[00:28:32.055 --> 00:28:33.796]  This was announced over a decade ago.
[00:28:33.996 --> 00:28:39.857]  They're now giving tax exemptions in a special development zone out by the old airport in Austin to do this.
[00:28:39.877 --> 00:28:41.678]  It's made national news, Wired Magazine.
[00:28:43.018 --> 00:28:50.560]  About a third of the comments are saying you're crazy, they're not going to put sensors in the house to track us, and there are no sensors in the new appliances.
[00:28:51.468 --> 00:28:53.535]  I mean this is in wired AP Reuters.
[00:28:54.057 --> 00:28:55.522]  I told you about it way before it happened.
[00:28:56.499 --> 00:28:58.980]  I'm not bragging, I'm just saying we were the trailblazers.
[00:28:59.561 --> 00:29:02.862]  Now it's all public, and still people say no.
[00:29:03.683 --> 00:29:22.953]  No, they're not watching me over my webcam, they're not listening to my cell phone or tracking it, and they're not coming out with toasters and microwave ovens and refrigerators and toilets that track everything you do, and Toyota and others coming out with face scanner, live cameras of the police that call the police on you if you yell at your kids or have a frown on your face.
[00:29:23.213 --> 00:29:24.954]  I mean, that's mainstream news.
[00:29:25.994 --> 00:29:28.236]  And I get why you can't admit it to yourself.
[00:29:28.256 --> 00:29:32.779]  Yeah, there's the headline, CIA chief will spy on you through your dishwasher.
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:37.683]  I get why you want to say I'm a liar, because you'll have to admit I'm right.
[00:29:37.763 --> 00:29:38.884]  You know I've been saying this forever.
[00:29:39.144 --> 00:29:40.005]  Now it's all happening.
[00:29:40.225 --> 00:29:41.666]  So just say, hey, it isn't true.
[00:29:41.886 --> 00:29:42.887]  Obamacare is free.
[00:29:44.348 --> 00:29:45.549]  You can keep your doctor.
[00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:47.110]  There's no tyranny.
[00:29:49.492 --> 00:29:50.433]  You didn't build that.
[00:29:50.533 --> 00:29:50.833]  Fine.
[00:29:50.893 --> 00:29:53.035]  Whatever you want to believe, you delusional cowards.
[00:29:54.035 --> 00:29:55.776]  Let's sit out there and say I'm making stuff up.
[00:29:55.996 --> 00:29:57.357]  Listen, I wish I was making it up.
[00:29:57.577 --> 00:29:57.857]  Okay?
[00:29:58.217 --> 00:29:58.958]  Go take some shots.
[00:29:58.978 --> 00:29:59.898]  We'll take some back scenes.
[00:30:00.759 --> 00:30:03.701]  Watch how fast they... Watch how fast you start having seizures.
[00:30:03.801 --> 00:30:05.381]  We'll be right back.
[00:30:05.421 --> 00:30:06.062]  Moron.
[00:30:06.162 --> 00:30:07.503]  Idiots out there calling me a liar.
[00:30:09.693 --> 00:30:12.994]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:30:13.134 --> 00:30:15.394]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:30:15.554 --> 00:30:23.876]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:30:24.156 --> 00:30:27.476]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:30:27.616 --> 00:30:37.898]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[00:30:38.198 --> 00:30:45.465]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:30:45.645 --> 00:30:47.547]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:30:47.888 --> 00:30:55.415]  Supermail Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:30:55.775 --> 00:31:01.897]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:31:02.217 --> 00:31:09.138]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mel Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:31:09.598 --> 00:31:11.239]  Introducing Pro One.

[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:19.441]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:31:19.821 --> 00:31:25.664]  We do have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilic acid.
[00:31:25.784 --> 00:31:36.770]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:43.093]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code water.
[00:31:43.273 --> 00:31:48.736]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides.
[00:31:49.016 --> 00:32:00.240]  Herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:32:00.581 --> 00:32:05.883]  Get your Pro-Pure with the new Pro-1 filters today at Infowarsstore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:32:09.304 --> 00:32:10.144]  The facts are in.
[00:32:10.344 --> 00:32:11.465]  The studies are legion.
[00:32:11.745 --> 00:32:19.108]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:32:19.248 --> 00:32:22.709]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:32:23.069 --> 00:32:23.489]  Simple.
[00:32:23.649 --> 00:32:28.071]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:32:28.351 --> 00:32:31.592]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet.
[00:32:31.792 --> 00:32:33.814]  But we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:32:34.075 --> 00:32:39.461]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation.
[00:32:39.621 --> 00:32:50.093]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:32:50.393 --> 00:32:54.658]  Let's take a stand against the globalists by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[00:32:54.978 --> 00:32:56.841]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[00:32:57.141 --> 00:33:02.447]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[00:33:02.707 --> 00:33:06.952]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the InfoWar at the same time.
[00:33:07.113 --> 00:33:08.394]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:33:26.636 --> 00:33:31.099]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:34.461]  And you know what Hawaii Five-0 is doing right now?
[00:33:35.622 --> 00:33:44.088]  They're shacked up in the penthouse of the biggest hotel in the main island with about 14 hookers, a pile of cocaine they confiscated.
[00:33:44.108 --> 00:33:45.609]  It was like the Secret Service.
[00:33:46.629 --> 00:33:50.352]  And they are engaged in heroic sex acts with the prostitutes.
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:56.863]  And it's all legal and lawful because they've exempted themselves from pilfering Ladies of the Night.
[00:33:58.844 --> 00:34:00.185]  Isn't that just interesting?
[00:34:01.226 --> 00:34:01.826]  Here it is.
[00:34:01.906 --> 00:34:05.808]  Hawaii law lets police have sex with prostitutes.
[00:34:06.849 --> 00:34:08.970]  And some in the legislature want to change that.
[00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:12.112]  It's part of their undercover investigations.
[00:34:14.482 --> 00:34:15.062]  There you go.
[00:34:15.082 --> 00:34:16.582]  I wonder if they play this music.
[00:34:16.822 --> 00:34:19.403]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun!
[00:34:19.443 --> 00:34:20.443]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun!
[00:34:20.463 --> 00:34:27.405]  See, it kind of has that... Crank it up, it's the end of it!
[00:34:27.425 --> 00:34:28.245]  Strip them, Danno!
[00:34:45.922 --> 00:34:46.422]  McGarrett!
[00:34:46.843 --> 00:34:47.563]  What are you doing?
[00:34:47.603 --> 00:34:49.085]  You're gonna have a heart attack!
[00:34:49.105 --> 00:34:50.106]  14 whores a day!
[00:34:50.566 --> 00:34:51.407]  McGarrett!
[00:34:51.887 --> 00:34:53.649]  What are you doing on the balcony?
[00:34:57.812 --> 00:34:58.273]  I'm sorry.
[00:34:58.293 --> 00:34:59.994]  I shouldn't have that much fun with this stuff.
[00:35:03.517 --> 00:35:04.838]  Dano, get me more whores.
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.080]  I'm sorry.
[00:35:08.561 --> 00:35:10.083]  That's Dano's main job, actually.
[00:35:11.854 --> 00:35:19.542]  You just look at McGarrett and tell what a snake he is, what a wolf he is, what a dog he is with the vixens.
[00:35:20.503 --> 00:35:22.626]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, let's just stop that joke right there.
[00:35:22.646 --> 00:35:24.728]  I got serious news to get to in your phone calls.
[00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:31.816]  But first off, I want to get into
[00:35:35.123 --> 00:35:43.970]  This, and I'm going to have the Nightly News do a piece on this because it is interesting, and then they can get where Buzz Bissinger on the show said he wanted to kill me and that Piers Morgan should kill me and Piers Morgan said, yes, I want to kill him.
[00:35:44.491 --> 00:36:01.605]  So at that point, just like I challenged him to a boxing match on the show before, I said, I challenge you and Buzz Bissinger, who likes to wear female's clothes, that's fine, he can dress as a woman, and we, both of them can actually, because that's about what they are, not knocking women, but as men, they're not very manly, and they can both get in the ring against me
[00:36:03.942 --> 00:36:05.382]  Either bare knuckle or with gloves.
[00:36:05.563 --> 00:36:06.423]  We can do it in Vegas.
[00:36:06.563 --> 00:36:09.344]  I guarantee a pay-per-view as big as that story was.
[00:36:09.464 --> 00:36:10.324]  It would get picked up.
[00:36:10.744 --> 00:36:12.465]  It would have millions that would pay on pay-per-view.
[00:36:12.825 --> 00:36:15.245]  And we could give the proceeds to charity.
[00:36:17.086 --> 00:36:18.907]  You notice they never took the challenge up.
[00:36:18.947 --> 00:36:20.687]  And I know he tweeted back at me and stuff about it.
[00:36:20.707 --> 00:36:22.688]  You know, basically saying, no thanks.
[00:36:23.588 --> 00:36:25.849]  You need to accept the challenge, coward.
[00:36:26.189 --> 00:36:26.909]  You're washed up.
[00:36:26.949 --> 00:36:28.109]  You're out of the United States.
[00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:29.370]  Everybody hates you.
[00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:32.491]  You're going to do a once a month magazine show for CNN, as I predicted they would give you.
[00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:38.796]  Hiding their mistakes, you know, acting like you're not a total failure, taking a show from two million viewers to three hundred and something thousand.
[00:36:39.217 --> 00:36:44.162]  You know, Morgan, I will literally beat the hell out of you and Buzz Bissinger.
[00:36:44.723 --> 00:36:46.045]  I tell you what, let's go further.
[00:36:48.078 --> 00:36:49.179]  Andy Kaufman would do this.
[00:36:49.359 --> 00:36:53.060]  I'll fight the ambassador's daughter who said she wants to kill me too on the show.
[00:36:53.641 --> 00:36:54.501]  Buzz Bissinger.
[00:36:54.741 --> 00:36:55.421]  So two women.
[00:36:55.642 --> 00:36:58.123]  I'll fight her, Buzz Bissinger, and you, Morgan.
[00:36:58.423 --> 00:36:58.923]  I'm serious.
[00:36:59.043 --> 00:37:04.005]  I will go in that ring and I will demolish all three of you within three rounds.
[00:37:04.386 --> 00:37:05.166]  I guarantee you.
[00:37:05.746 --> 00:37:07.807]  I will annihilate you within three rounds.
[00:37:08.567 --> 00:37:09.588]  Guaranteed, cowards.
[00:37:10.128 --> 00:37:10.868]  All three of you.
[00:37:11.049 --> 00:37:11.529]  I'm serious.
[00:37:11.789 --> 00:37:16.131]  In the ring, I will come in there and stomp the hell out of all of you, including your tart.
[00:37:18.166 --> 00:37:20.427]  Because she wants to talk about how she wants me dead and everything.
[00:37:20.467 --> 00:37:21.907]  Well, get in the ring with me, you wench!
[00:37:23.128 --> 00:37:24.608]  I will take all three of you on.
[00:37:26.029 --> 00:37:28.850]  First thing I'll do is punch her in the solar plexus, taking her out.
[00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:37.373]  Then I'll go over to Morgan, and I will absolutely start just battering his head with both gloves, and then I'm going to turn on Bissinger.
[00:37:39.694 --> 00:37:40.554]  All three of you.
[00:37:40.834 --> 00:37:41.695]  All three of you.
[00:37:41.755 --> 00:37:42.235]  Come on!
[00:37:43.155 --> 00:37:44.976]  Quite a man, but I will take on that little brunette.
[00:37:46.408 --> 00:37:48.109]  They don't call me McGarrett for nothing, folks.
[00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:54.593]  The point is, ladies and gentlemen, is that this guy's a coward.
[00:37:54.633 --> 00:37:57.575]  So, everybody knows I challenged him to that.
[00:37:57.875 --> 00:38:02.458]  Well, now the host of Top Gear that looks just like him in the UK is probably a staged publicity stunt.
[00:38:03.379 --> 00:38:04.941]  He said if he dies, he dies.
[00:38:05.021 --> 00:38:11.910]  Piers Drago Morgan challenges Jeremy Clarkson after he challenged him to a fight for charity in the ring.
[00:38:12.651 --> 00:38:13.932]  And so that's now in the news.
[00:38:14.673 --> 00:38:19.920]  It's a 50,000 pound to charity for Piers Morgan and Jeremy Clarkson boxing fight.
[00:38:26.288 --> 00:38:27.570]  You know, I think Clarkson will win.
[00:38:27.591 --> 00:38:31.197]  You can just look at the look in that guy's eyes and the size of his neck compared to Piers Morgan.
[00:38:31.779 --> 00:38:33.181]  Piers Morgan is a complete ninny.
[00:38:33.863 --> 00:38:37.730]  And unless the thing's staged, I think Morgan's gonna get his butt handed to him.
[00:38:40.123 --> 00:38:56.710]  So V12 Shots, LTD, a company that recently launched a protein drink, the V12 Protein Shot, has offered to donate £50,000, or about $80,000, to help for Heroes Charity, and Piers Morgan and Jeremy Clarkson's agreed to fight.
[00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:57.650]  They've now agreed to fight.
[00:38:59.291 --> 00:38:59.551]  Listen!
[00:39:00.532 --> 00:39:04.533]  Fifty million dollars is what a Piers Morgan-Alex Jones fight would raise.
[00:39:05.094 --> 00:39:05.554]  Seriously.
[00:39:06.054 --> 00:39:11.856]  That was voted in LA Times, Time Magazine, you name it, by voters multiple times.
[00:39:12.216 --> 00:39:13.637]  The number one political story of 2013.
[00:39:14.037 --> 00:39:15.797]  Can you believe that?
[00:39:16.198 --> 00:39:19.539]  The number one viral
[00:39:20.772 --> 00:39:25.415]  Media event, multiple places, thousands of newspapers, every show out there.
[00:39:25.435 --> 00:39:27.737]  Here's Morgan vs. Alex Jones.
[00:39:28.177 --> 00:39:33.040]  I challenged him to a boxing match right then.
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:33.040]  $80,000?
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:33.701]  Really?
[00:39:34.041 --> 00:39:35.662]  I guarantee you, I've got the connections.
[00:39:35.782 --> 00:39:36.522]  I know Dana White.
[00:39:37.443 --> 00:39:38.164]  I know Joe Rogan.
[00:39:38.624 --> 00:39:40.065]  I've hung out with Dana White repeatedly.
[00:39:40.425 --> 00:39:42.687]  I'll guarantee you I can make phone calls.
[00:39:43.746 --> 00:39:54.050]  And I guarantee you, they, they're businessmen, I guarantee you, they could get the Vegas match on and it would be on television and pay-per-view and dominate.
[00:39:54.711 --> 00:39:57.712]  It would air on television the next day and be on channels all over the country.
[00:39:58.372 --> 00:40:05.495]  But no, Piers Morgan will not allow his career to be destroyed, because he knows, I will go in that ring and I will beat the living hell out of him.
[00:40:07.296 --> 00:40:10.177]  Oh man, I would love to get in there with him, just, oh, oh!
[00:40:12.501 --> 00:40:13.401]  Man, I would love it!
[00:40:14.202 --> 00:40:15.842]  So I know you're a coward, Morgan.
[00:40:17.243 --> 00:40:19.604]  You, the woman, and the other woman.
[00:40:19.825 --> 00:40:21.185]  I'll take on you and the two women.
[00:40:22.146 --> 00:40:23.647]  You and Buzz Bissinger and the other woman.
[00:40:24.927 --> 00:40:26.008]  That would add to it.
[00:40:26.268 --> 00:40:27.809]  Maybe we'd make a hundred mil.
[00:40:29.069 --> 00:40:29.730]  Give it to charity.
[00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:34.652]  We could give it to Salvation Army.
[00:40:34.712 --> 00:40:35.333]  How's that sound?
[00:40:35.553 --> 00:40:36.193]  You probably don't like that.
[00:40:36.233 --> 00:40:36.954]  That's a Christian group.
[00:40:37.938 --> 00:40:41.942]  In fact, you know what, you're a coward, but let me say this, they'll want to pay for it in Vegas.
[00:40:41.962 --> 00:40:53.331]  Let's say a third of it goes to the promoters, everybody, and then what's left, 90% goes to charity, you can have the money.
[00:40:54.112 --> 00:41:03.240]  You and the cowards that get in the ring, you can have 6, 7, 8%, whatever it comes out to, because you're not going to have a career anyways, you've already failed, so what?
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.502]  I'm going to beat you to pieces in the ring.
[00:41:07.617 --> 00:41:07.997]  So what?
[00:41:08.017 --> 00:41:09.258]  I'm going to totally dominate you.
[00:41:09.398 --> 00:41:10.479]  You're already washed up.
[00:41:12.181 --> 00:41:14.242]  Get in... Folks, this is real.
[00:41:14.402 --> 00:41:15.043]  I'm serious.
[00:41:17.064 --> 00:41:18.305]  This is your last hurrah.
[00:41:18.365 --> 00:41:19.306]  Morgan, don't be scared.
[00:41:19.346 --> 00:41:20.247]  Get in the ring with me.
[00:41:20.687 --> 00:41:21.788]  And you know it's all talk.
[00:41:22.108 --> 00:41:23.349]  Some redneck Texan.
[00:41:23.369 --> 00:41:25.771]  You're going to punch me one time.
[00:41:25.791 --> 00:41:28.233]  I'm going to fall over in a fetal position, bud.
[00:41:28.733 --> 00:41:29.494]  You know that.
[00:41:30.215 --> 00:41:31.235]  You know this is all talk.
[00:41:31.275 --> 00:41:34.318]  You know I'm actually deep down scared of getting in the ring with you.
[00:41:35.583 --> 00:41:38.946]  So I think the answer is, Morgan, you need to get in the ring with me.
[00:41:39.347 --> 00:41:40.668]  Oh man, I wish he'd get in the ring with me.
[00:41:42.269 --> 00:41:48.615]  Oh man, I would just... I guarantee you... First shot, man, I'd have him half knocked out.
[00:41:48.655 --> 00:41:50.697]  I'd get him up against the ropes and just undercut.
[00:41:50.777 --> 00:41:52.179]  Full power, breaking that jaw.
[00:41:52.559 --> 00:41:53.800]  Just full hate power.
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.081]  Just full hate!
[00:41:55.722 --> 00:41:56.142]  Excuse me.
[00:41:56.362 --> 00:41:56.663]  Anyways...
[00:42:02.555 --> 00:42:06.658]  Alright, now I'm kind of engaged in mental you-know-what on the air.
[00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:12.462]  And it is kind of like hatred porn, and I apologize, God, that I'm being like that.
[00:42:12.482 --> 00:42:19.467]  I shouldn't have moments of exquisite hatred for the coward, the filth, the enemy redcoat who we've defeated.
[00:42:19.487 --> 00:42:27.493]  I just have such a, quite frankly, an unholy lust to defeat the enemy that I shouldn't be like that, and I apologize and repent.
[00:42:27.814 --> 00:42:29.515]  But I still will get in the ring with him.
[00:42:33.015 --> 00:42:34.576]  We're gonna send this video to Piers Morgan.
[00:42:34.596 --> 00:42:36.258]  We're gonna do a special report tonight on this.
[00:42:36.638 --> 00:42:37.979]  Showing him saying he wants to kill me.
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:39.581]  Look, you want to kill me?
[00:42:40.141 --> 00:42:41.462]  There's your chance, buddy.
[00:42:42.083 --> 00:42:43.364]  Get in the ring with me.
[00:42:43.444 --> 00:42:44.345]  Get in the ring.
[00:42:44.445 --> 00:42:45.326]  Get in the ring.
[00:42:45.646 --> 00:42:47.287]  Get in the ring, coward!
[00:42:49.269 --> 00:42:51.211]  You and... Buzz Bissinger.
[00:42:52.852 --> 00:42:53.973]  I was joking about the woman.
[00:42:56.415 --> 00:42:57.917]  Fighting one man and one woman's enough.
[00:42:59.625 --> 00:43:01.145]  Okay, I said I'd go to your phone calls.
[00:43:02.566 --> 00:43:10.727]  We'll do that and then I'll get into the fact that your Connect Box is watching everything you do and looking through your walls.
[00:43:10.787 --> 00:43:13.188]  I told you that three years ago when they first started coming out with it.
[00:43:13.908 --> 00:43:15.008]  Now it's mainstream news.
[00:43:15.388 --> 00:43:16.048]  And here's another one.
[00:43:16.088 --> 00:43:20.289]  Facebook facial recognition software is now as accurate as the human brain, but what now?
[00:43:20.529 --> 00:43:26.170]  And it's face scanning people on the streets all over the world and putting it into integrated NSA databases.
[00:43:27.554 --> 00:43:33.151]  That's why it's a joke to have Zuckerberg, total Bilderberg group member, saying to Obama, please stop spying on us.
[00:43:33.192 --> 00:43:34.255]  I mean, that is literally...
[00:43:35.626 --> 00:43:39.207]  Like Satan's left hand telling Satan's right hand to stop scratching its rear end.
[00:43:40.048 --> 00:43:42.249]  I mean, this is just absolutely incredible.
[00:43:42.609 --> 00:43:49.051]  All over the country, face-scanning cameras going in the buses, on the roads, in the trains, in the taxi cabs.
[00:43:49.471 --> 00:43:51.772]  Mikel Phelan article that went on DrugsReport.com.
[00:43:52.352 --> 00:43:55.634]  New York trains to install audio-video recorders.
[00:43:55.674 --> 00:43:56.494]  Very important article.
[00:43:56.514 --> 00:43:58.835]  You can go watch the local newscast about that.
[00:43:58.855 --> 00:44:00.916]  Of course, how do people respond to us reporting this?
[00:44:00.936 --> 00:44:01.816]  They just say it's not true.
[00:44:04.431 --> 00:44:07.794]  They just say that none of it is true and everything is wonderful.
[00:44:09.095 --> 00:44:14.100]  Even though public schools are watching kids nationwide over the quote free laptops they give the people.
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:20.685]  Here's some of the other news and we're going to go to your calls and get to that clip of the demonization of Rand Paul for calling for unity.
[00:44:21.706 --> 00:44:28.292]  By Al, I want to create balkanization and division because I work for a globalist run news outfit, Sharpton.
[00:44:28.832 --> 00:44:31.535]  Pelosi, we couldn't be prouder of Ocare.
[00:44:34.662 --> 00:44:36.243]  And there's video of this.
[00:44:36.283 --> 00:44:39.784]  House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi defended the President's health care law as a winner.
[00:44:39.804 --> 00:44:42.005]  That's a new thing.
[00:44:42.105 --> 00:44:42.885]  Everybody loves it.
[00:44:42.905 --> 00:44:45.326]  We should be thankful to Kim Jong-il, I mean Obama, for it.
[00:44:45.906 --> 00:44:47.127]  No one ever got denied.
[00:44:47.167 --> 00:44:48.267]  It's been a total success.
[00:44:48.947 --> 00:44:49.748]  Pigs can fly.
[00:44:49.808 --> 00:44:50.808]  Moon's made of cheese.
[00:44:51.328 --> 00:44:52.088]  There's no tyranny.
[00:44:52.589 --> 00:44:58.031]  Despite worries of increasing premiums and the drag it could have on Democrats this fall.
[00:44:58.611 --> 00:45:01.292]  The worries of increasing premiums are going up across the board.
[00:45:02.008 --> 00:45:02.829]  But that's okay.
[00:45:03.009 --> 00:45:04.611]  Look at this symbol if you're watching on TV.
[00:45:05.032 --> 00:45:06.734]  If not, the article's on Infowars.com.
[00:45:07.555 --> 00:45:10.318]  Daughter of Pelosi mocks Gadsden.
[00:45:10.378 --> 00:45:11.980]  Don't tread on my Obamacare.
[00:45:12.401 --> 00:45:15.325]  And they create a little snake in the design of a stethoscope.
[00:45:16.192 --> 00:45:18.655]  The apple doesn't fall far from the degenerate tree.
[00:45:19.236 --> 00:45:34.033]  Christine Pelosi, the daughter of California Senator Nancy Pelosi, she's not a senator, she's a house, you need to get that corrected in that article, that's not my article, but seems to be right on board with the movement to further centralize all aspects of American life.
[00:45:34.514 --> 00:45:36.196]  In a recent Twitter post, Pelosi
[00:45:37.708 --> 00:45:46.415]  Proudly displayed a knockoff image of the famed Gadsden flag, which has been a hallmark of the liberty movement in America's inception amidst the American Revolution of 1775.
[00:45:46.595 --> 00:45:48.657]  Yeah, it's proliferating everywhere now.
[00:45:48.677 --> 00:45:51.759]  That's why they're trying to ban it on military bases, make the Marine Corps get rid of it.
[00:45:52.159 --> 00:45:54.041]  It's older than the American flag.
[00:45:55.916 --> 00:45:59.360]  When the war started, they started using it already as a state militia flag.
[00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:01.342]  It was used in Virginia and other states.
[00:46:01.943 --> 00:46:09.851]  So it's older than the American flag, and they're making the Marines and others, and the Navy, Navy SEALs, it's now been outlawed on their official patches.
[00:46:12.114 --> 00:46:16.638]  So, and of course the Navy was one of the first to use it as well, under John Paul Jones.
[00:46:17.756 --> 00:46:20.939]  With a ship sinking, fighting a British ship three times his size.
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:23.081]  He said, they said, surrendered.
[00:46:23.101 --> 00:46:24.322]  He said, I've only begun to fight.
[00:46:24.823 --> 00:46:27.786]  Rided the ship, rammed the enemy, took it and won.
[00:46:29.347 --> 00:46:30.268]  Anyways, continuing.
[00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:32.891]  But the Navy SEALs can't have that.
[00:46:32.911 --> 00:46:33.491]  The founder of the U.S.
[00:46:33.531 --> 00:46:34.672]  Navy, you can't have the founder of the U.S.
[00:46:34.692 --> 00:46:36.254]  Navy's flag on your, on your pass.
[00:46:36.274 --> 00:46:36.995]  Because it's racist.
[00:46:37.295 --> 00:46:39.037]  Because Al Sharpton said so, and he's God.
[00:46:40.461 --> 00:46:57.918]  Daughter Pelosi, in support of the health care initiative championed by her mummy, the younger parasite, Pelosi, revealed and released the following image on her unwavering support for the mandated legislation that has thus far tripled prices for most working Americans and left millions more with no insurance coverage.
[00:46:58.779 --> 00:46:59.299]  Well, why not?
[00:46:59.339 --> 00:47:01.982]  I mean, we're a helpless group of slaves, they think.
[00:47:02.002 --> 00:47:02.662]  Why not abuse us?
[00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:07.772]  As long as it's a bunch of trendies prancing around talking with lisp, everyone thinks it's okay.
[00:47:08.312 --> 00:47:14.795]  The image being offered as a bumper sticker replaces the traditional Gadsden snake with a coiled stethoscope, which is about right.
[00:47:14.815 --> 00:47:17.576]  I guess Obamacare is a snake about to bite you.
[00:47:18.357 --> 00:47:23.999]  The Gadsden flag is a rattlesnake warning you, don't step on me, I'll bite you.
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.260]  Rattlesnakes are more of a noble snake.
[00:47:26.761 --> 00:47:28.261]  They don't usually want to bite humans.
[00:47:28.281 --> 00:47:29.002]  They're not aggressive.
[00:47:29.022 --> 00:47:30.442]  They like to kill rats, mainly.
[00:47:30.662 --> 00:47:31.203]  They eat mice.
[00:47:32.113 --> 00:47:37.998]  They're a infrared hunting viper, and they're not really an issue.
[00:47:38.118 --> 00:47:42.641]  Water moccasins seek humans out to bite them and are a horrible snake, and I kill them every time I see them.
[00:47:43.282 --> 00:47:49.407]  Coral snakes are a friendly snake, which are gregarious and fun-loving, but are in the cobra family and will kill you.
[00:47:49.867 --> 00:47:52.449]  So I guess you have to kill them if you find them in your backyard as well.
[00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:53.810]  Just a side issue.
[00:47:54.311 --> 00:47:55.632]  I do find it fitting, actually.
[00:47:57.597 --> 00:48:04.384]  That you have picked the symbol of a snake, coiled for your movement to bite the American people.
[00:48:04.705 --> 00:48:07.067]  I notice it's black too, water moccasin.
[00:48:07.608 --> 00:48:11.232]  That's a good snake for you to pick right there.
[00:48:11.252 --> 00:48:13.694]  A cobra is aggressive and likes to bite humans.
[00:48:14.195 --> 00:48:14.695]  How about that?
[00:48:15.276 --> 00:48:16.036]  You know, death panels.
[00:48:16.797 --> 00:48:17.477]  So that's that.
[00:48:17.497 --> 00:48:22.840]  I'm going to come back, go to your calls in the next hour, and then I'll get to all the Al Sharpton news and the rest of it.
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:28.562]  A bunch of different videos in my video list today that we're going to be getting to and analyzing.
[00:48:30.183 --> 00:48:40.588]  But again, Catherine and Steve and Grant and Rob and many others, we are going to be taking your phone calls when we come up in the next segment.
[00:48:42.076 --> 00:48:44.938]  And the total free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:48:44.958 --> 00:48:55.383]  And I'll talk about any subject you want, but mindless, schizophrenic, infighting, Cass Sunstein 101 garbage.
[00:48:55.543 --> 00:49:00.506]  I do not get into that here on my show on 160 plus AM and FM things, you know.
[00:49:01.246 --> 00:49:02.827]  Is it true you're Bill Hicks?
[00:49:03.007 --> 00:49:06.289]  Or is it true you're a space alien, because I read it?
[00:49:06.329 --> 00:49:08.370]  Or is it true you murder children?
[00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:10.491]  Or is it true you're a cocaine dealer?
[00:49:11.011 --> 00:49:14.074]  Or is it true that Obama pays you with the Israelis?
[00:49:14.134 --> 00:49:16.517]  Or is it true you work for the Koch brothers?
[00:49:16.577 --> 00:49:18.719]  Or is it true you work for the Vatican?
[00:49:18.739 --> 00:49:22.563]  Or is it true you work for the British government?
[00:49:22.583 --> 00:49:25.346]  No, I work for me and liberty and the future freedom.
[00:49:26.676 --> 00:49:29.520]  So, I will not get into any schizophrenic phone calls today.
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:31.482]  Or junior high.
[00:49:31.562 --> 00:49:33.024]  I left junior high a long time ago.
[00:49:33.365 --> 00:49:36.609]  But other than that kind of stuff, everything is free and wide open.
[00:49:36.669 --> 00:49:37.730]  I will not in-fight either.
[00:49:38.191 --> 00:49:39.493]  Whether libertarian or patriot host.
[00:49:40.274 --> 00:49:41.375]  That's why we're successful.
[00:49:41.415 --> 00:49:42.096]  We cover news.
[00:49:42.437 --> 00:49:44.740]  People that tune in here, hear us talk about news and information.
[00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:46.741]  A passion for freedom, they resonate with it.
[00:49:47.201 --> 00:49:56.464]  Speaking of a passion for freedom, I have a passion for the best products out there like the Pro-1 and now the Pro-2.0 system that takes out even more of the glyphosates and fluoride.
[00:49:56.724 --> 00:50:01.646]  It's the same price or lower than leading competitors and annihilates the competition in side-by-side comparisons.
[00:50:02.106 --> 00:50:05.107]  I could sell the leading competitors and make more money, I won't do it.
[00:50:05.187 --> 00:50:12.289]  If there's something so good, it's better than everything else, I sell Pro-1 G2.0, the G2 filters.
[00:50:12.629 --> 00:50:14.410]  And we have the G1s as well, they're excellent.
[00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:21.567]  And we've got a pitcher system that is a lot less money and has the Pro-G2 systems in it.
[00:50:21.747 --> 00:50:25.171]  And no one, I mean, this is like the cost of a Brita filter that's just charcoal.
[00:50:25.652 --> 00:50:27.293]  This has filters that actually knock it all out.
[00:50:27.394 --> 00:50:31.658]  It's unprecedented what they've got with the Pro-Pure water pitcher systems.
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:36.003]  It's just absolutely unprecedented to be able to get something like this for that price.
[00:50:36.724 --> 00:50:41.166]  I mean, leading competitors sell systems that cut out glyphosates and fluoride for the cost of the pitcher and the filter.
[00:50:41.607 --> 00:50:51.972]  Ten percent off promo code water, a perpetual special that I had to really pull a lot of teeth to be able to offer you this price and drive down the market price of this.
[00:50:52.032 --> 00:50:54.433]  So, we have the best prices, the widest selection.
[00:50:54.513 --> 00:50:56.714]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:50:57.135 --> 00:51:00.276]  Infowarslife.com has the new silver bullet, colloidal silver.
[00:51:00.316 --> 00:51:01.397]  We got a lab to develop.
[00:51:01.677 --> 00:51:03.098]  It's the strongest thing we could find.
[00:51:03.418 --> 00:51:04.758]  Do not use on a regular basis.
[00:51:04.798 --> 00:51:05.219]  This is for

[00:51:51.432 --> 00:51:53.093]  I really love this Magic Mud product.

[00:51:59.256 --> 00:52:00.677]  I highly recommend My Magic Mud.

[00:52:09.125 --> 00:52:12.570]  It's been said, those who control the food, control the people.
[00:52:12.810 --> 00:52:16.535]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[00:52:16.636 --> 00:52:22.584]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[00:52:22.824 --> 00:52:24.146]  Genetically modified crops
[00:52:24.326 --> 00:52:32.910]  Processed foods and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system, which accounts for 80% of your immune system.

[00:54:16.467 --> 00:54:18.748]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:34.779]  Every time I turn on television, all I see is honoring Obama for this, honoring him for that, honoring him for being such a good figure, had to destroy America.
[00:54:35.239 --> 00:54:39.783]  Now Steven Spielberg to honor President Obama at USC gala.
[00:54:41.045 --> 00:54:43.967]  And I'm sure that'll be televised.
[00:54:44.748 --> 00:54:47.931]  Michelle Obama was wearing all red in China showing her solidarity.
[00:54:50.530 --> 00:54:55.699]  On and on and on, making themselves celebrities, shoving themselves in our face while they rob us.
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:57.562]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[00:54:58.023 --> 00:55:00.487]  Let's talk to Catherine in Canada.
[00:55:00.547 --> 00:55:01.268]  Thanks for calling.
[00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:02.931]  Hi Alex.
[00:55:03.472 --> 00:55:03.592]  Hey.
[00:55:05.237 --> 00:55:09.422]  Alright, there's been an article surfacing on the internet, a Russian article from 2008.
[00:55:09.502 --> 00:55:18.132]  The headline reads, Obama to start World War III, and inside the article it states it's going to start in Crimea.
[00:55:18.693 --> 00:55:20.535]  And I'm just wondering if there's relevance to this?
[00:55:20.595 --> 00:55:21.717]  Have you heard about this?
[00:55:23.072 --> 00:55:35.781]  No, it's been official, State Department plan, and Brzezinski put it in his book in 2007, that they've always planned to take Ukraine, and they knew the Russians would take Crimea, so the news is, Russians take Crimea, which is a tiny part of the country.
[00:55:35.801 --> 00:55:40.665]  Now the news is, NATO and the EU just grabbed almost the whole country, and overthrew the government.
[00:55:41.205 --> 00:55:43.307]  But in La La Land, they spin it back the other way.
[00:55:43.587 --> 00:55:48.090]  Now regardless of whether you're pro-Russia or pro-EU, or you're neutral like I am,
[00:55:49.096 --> 00:55:51.538]  Two predatory arms, you know, fighting over something.
[00:55:52.038 --> 00:55:56.361]  The issue is the West started it, and our media lies to people about what's going on.
[00:55:57.301 --> 00:56:04.666]  So, yeah, it's in Serbia reported that Obama would initiate World War III with Crimea as starting point, 2008 political analyst forecast.
[00:56:05.874 --> 00:56:23.045]  and uh... i mean that's been that's official pentagon nato plan is to take over all the former soviet union satellites and then put in authoritarian regimes move in against the russian uh... border put in anti-missile systems to shoot down their response nukes and then preemptively strike russia
[00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:27.711]  So there is revelance to that article.
[00:56:27.751 --> 00:56:32.752]  Well, I don't know about that particular article and what its overall analysis is, or even that publication.
[00:56:33.132 --> 00:56:35.013]  I know it's been the stated goal.
[00:56:35.553 --> 00:56:41.974]  The West is trying to overthrow Russia inside the country with political operatives funded by George Soros and the State Department.
[00:56:42.555 --> 00:56:50.717]  They were funding the Tsarnaev brothers to go create al-Qaeda wings, the Boston Bombers, supposed patsies, to bomb the Russians.
[00:56:51.758 --> 00:56:57.520]  I mean, the people running our country, the oligarch bankers that Russia kicked out, are trying to start a war with Russia.
[00:56:57.860 --> 00:56:59.661]  They're attacking them on every front publicly.
[00:57:01.242 --> 00:57:05.203]  Just the average American literally doesn't know what planet we're on and doesn't even know this is happening.
[00:57:06.403 --> 00:57:11.806]  Our government with NATO attacked the Russians in 2008, blowing up their military bases.
[00:57:13.126 --> 00:57:17.568]  Killing everyone in the barracks in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
[00:57:19.808 --> 00:57:20.849]  That's how crazy this is.
[00:57:22.841 --> 00:57:24.284]  Alright, well thank you for taking my call.
[00:57:24.684 --> 00:57:25.125]  Thank you.
[00:57:25.586 --> 00:57:26.087]  God bless you.
[00:57:26.127 --> 00:57:27.189]  Great, great question.
[00:57:27.209 --> 00:57:28.952]  Yes, no, that's been the plan.
[00:57:29.453 --> 00:57:30.194]  That is the plan.
[00:57:31.772 --> 00:57:34.173]  You've heard all the military people call in going, no, no, that's the plan.
[00:57:34.193 --> 00:57:34.793]  That's what's going on.
[00:57:34.833 --> 00:57:35.993]  It's the three legs of the tripod.
[00:57:36.253 --> 00:57:37.133]  It's a public plan!
[00:57:38.113 --> 00:57:39.574]  General Wesley Clark's talked about it.
[00:57:39.614 --> 00:57:40.554]  I mean, it's all there.
[00:57:40.594 --> 00:57:43.115]  I mean, I'm not telling you anything secret.
[00:57:43.915 --> 00:57:49.376]  It's not my opinion they're going to have sensors in all the toilets that track everything you do and report it to the police.
[00:57:49.896 --> 00:57:56.318]  It's not my opinion that all pills that are prescription will have a tracker RFID the size of a grain of sand on them.
[00:57:56.358 --> 00:57:57.118]  It's already coming out.
[00:57:57.478 --> 00:58:00.420]  It's not my opinion they put cancer viruses in all the major vaccines.
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:01.220]  It's on record.
[00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:04.221]  It's not my opinion they put flora in the water to brain damage you.
[00:58:04.542 --> 00:58:08.243]  They write books bragging White House science czar eco-science.
[00:58:09.744 --> 00:58:12.966]  They think you're so dumb their whole criminal operation is public.
[00:58:13.386 --> 00:58:14.587]  The white slavery rings.
[00:58:14.947 --> 00:58:16.327]  The child kidnapping rings.
[00:58:16.548 --> 00:58:17.848]  The narcotics trafficking.
[00:58:18.228 --> 00:58:19.029]  The whore running.
[00:58:19.189 --> 00:58:19.649]  Everything!
[00:58:19.669 --> 00:58:20.469]  They run it all!
[00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:25.352]  The government's there to make sure nobody cuts in on their operation.
[00:58:26.482 --> 00:58:36.848]  The average cop's totally naive, like the general public, departmentalized out there, giving people tickets and going to fires and car wrecks and changing, you know, people's oil farm or whatever.
[00:58:37.469 --> 00:58:38.850]  I mean, I don't even know anymore.
[00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:39.910]  It's just total hell.
[00:58:40.631 --> 00:58:42.712]  And it's because we're so naive it's allowed this to happen.
[00:58:43.192 --> 00:58:44.833]  Steve, Scott, Rob, Terry.
[00:58:46.655 --> 00:58:47.775]  You're up next, second hour.
[00:58:50.217 --> 00:58:51.918]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:59:08.610 --> 00:59:16.714]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:59:17.014 --> 00:59:21.716]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:59:21.897 --> 00:59:28.600]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.

[00:59:35.844 --> 00:59:42.707]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:59:42.887 --> 00:59:47.248]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[00:59:57.051 --> 00:59:58.751]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:00:02.552 --> 01:00:04.473]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:04.933 --> 01:00:07.754]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:14.451 --> 01:00:15.071]  Big Brother.
[01:00:15.752 --> 01:00:16.773]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:17.513 --> 01:00:18.614]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:19.274 --> 01:00:20.075]  You want answers?
[01:00:20.856 --> 01:00:21.776]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:22.417 --> 01:00:26.019]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:30.643]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.456 --> 01:00:37.140]  I love this quote by Michelle Obama, Yahoo News.
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:40.602]  Human rights are off the agenda when she's in China.
[01:00:41.483 --> 01:00:44.505]  Of course, she'd love to annihilate all our rights, snapping turtle.
[01:00:47.567 --> 01:00:54.932]  Bunch of news coming up on the economy, on attacks on the First Amendment, on the Iranian ship off the U.S.
[01:00:54.972 --> 01:00:55.292]  coast.
[01:00:57.734 --> 01:00:59.255]  But right now, let's go back to your phone call.
[01:00:59.295 --> 01:01:00.976]  Steve in Florida, thanks for calling in.
[01:01:00.996 --> 01:01:01.457]  You're on the air.
[01:01:02.739 --> 01:01:03.780]  Alex, hey, buddy, can you hear me?
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.341]  Yes, sir.
[01:01:05.001 --> 01:01:08.525]  Hey, buddy, I bullhorned Bill Maher in Jacksonville, Florida on March 16th.
[01:01:08.605 --> 01:01:10.206]  That was about five days ago.
[01:01:10.226 --> 01:01:11.247]  It's on YouTube.
[01:01:11.948 --> 01:01:12.628]  Go to YouTube.
[01:01:12.648 --> 01:01:18.474]  My YouTube channel is CyberBullyScrounge, or just type in Bill Maher Bullhorned, and it's awesome.
[01:01:18.494 --> 01:01:21.697]  I need this video to go mega viral, because we've got to bring down this usurper.
[01:01:22.457 --> 01:01:23.478]  Well, that's right.
[01:01:23.498 --> 01:01:32.164]  He's an anti-gun, anti-life, anti-freedom turd who poses as a liberal and he goes around doing his pathetic show that he can hardly sell out anywhere he goes.
[01:01:33.425 --> 01:01:34.826]  And I love people bullhorning him.
[01:01:34.846 --> 01:01:40.970]  We've had folks basically take over a show before live on air when they do it live with Inside Job, Building 7.
[01:01:41.691 --> 01:01:43.352]  Do you want us to air your video here on air?
[01:01:43.752 --> 01:01:46.833]  Oh, absolutely, because we need this thing to pick up some momentum.
[01:01:46.853 --> 01:01:50.415]  Because if we can take down Bill Maher, then that's a big operative right there.
[01:01:50.435 --> 01:01:52.595]  That's a propagandist, and he's a key player.
[01:01:52.855 --> 01:01:56.257]  And I chose him because he's so easy to go after.
[01:01:56.277 --> 01:02:02.519]  And I mean, he was in the middle of running his mouth about Mother Teresa, and then I pulled the bullhorn out of my pants and I just let him have it.
[01:02:02.659 --> 01:02:03.039]  Oh my gosh.
[01:02:03.059 --> 01:02:05.140]  I'm glad you didn't throw an elbow into that bouncer's throat.
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:08.301]  No, no, that's the way to do it is just go, I comply and they'll just let you go.
[01:02:30.555 --> 01:02:31.096]  Absolutely.
[01:02:31.196 --> 01:02:36.280]  I needed to secure the video, so I got out of there, I ran away, and, uh... Well done, Lord Vader!
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:45.568]  And, uh, also, I just wanted to let you know, I'm an Ableton producer, and I've been cataloging your show for, um, for over a year now, and I just wanted to let you know that I've been taking...
[01:02:45.968 --> 01:02:55.454]  Your speeches and turning them into like a GCN buffer music and Alex Jones Radio Show buffer music with some dubstep and I sent something to Showtips at Infowars.
[01:02:55.794 --> 01:03:11.623]  Well I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, send it to Showtips at Infowars again because we have a great crew they just get overwhelmed with everything and I'm running around like a Tasmanian hillbilly but the point is send us that info and it's Bill Maher Bullhorned and what's the name of your YouTube channel again?
[01:03:12.617 --> 01:03:13.778]  CyberBullyScrounge.
[01:03:14.058 --> 01:03:18.600]  C-Y-P-E-R-D-U-L-L-Y-S-C-R-O-U-N-G-E.
[01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:20.761]  Well that's what we want, CyberBullyScrounge, got it.
[01:03:21.122 --> 01:03:32.968]  What we want is people to go out as info warriors and to go out and do their own reports and go out and send them to us, post them, and if they're good, we'll get them up.
[01:03:33.528 --> 01:03:41.333]  My problem is that I mainly supported We Are Change over the years because I helped start it, helped promote Luke and what he was doing because
[01:03:42.193 --> 01:03:51.666]  People will then go say they're InfoWars reporters, and then say they work for me, and then go do things in my name, and then people are like, hey, I gotta deal with InfoWars.
[01:03:52.166 --> 01:03:57.633]  So I need to put like a contract up on the web or something that explains, you as an independent person believe in the InfoWars.
[01:03:58.194 --> 01:04:11.563]  And so you go out and independently do reports, not affiliated with us, but then if you send us an email giving us the rights to air what you've done, we may reserve the right to play part or all of it on the radio or TV show.
[01:04:11.583 --> 01:04:14.045]  You know, just like America's Funniest Video or whatever.
[01:04:14.365 --> 01:04:16.927]  And so you just submit us stuff, doesn't have to be from InfoWars, whatever.
[01:04:17.227 --> 01:04:26.073]  Just say you're a citizen reporter, put it on YouTube, have in the annotation that we're free to use it or whatever, and then we'll go through it, and it'll be on the Nightly News, radio, you name it.
[01:04:26.153 --> 01:04:27.794]  That's what will destroy the globalists.
[01:04:28.354 --> 01:04:30.856]  Is more people going out like Mark Dice, which I'm starting to see happen.
[01:04:31.697 --> 01:04:36.822]  More people going out and confronting globalists, going out to press conferences, asking real questions.
[01:04:37.262 --> 01:04:38.963]  That will take over their media system.
[01:04:39.204 --> 01:04:41.446]  That's why they're trying to even get rid of press conferences, period.
[01:04:41.986 --> 01:04:43.688]  That's where the real protest is going on.
[01:04:44.048 --> 01:04:46.530]  Not just going out on the street and getting beaten by riot police.
[01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:47.951]  Show up in a suit and tie.
[01:04:48.852 --> 01:04:51.234]  Show up with your camera, whether you got a buddy with a camera or whatever and a mic.
[01:04:51.254 --> 01:04:52.355]  Get up there, do it professional.
[01:04:52.956 --> 01:04:54.257]  And you build it, they will come.
[01:04:54.597 --> 01:04:55.978]  People that have a passion for liberty.
[01:04:55.998 --> 01:05:00.362]  A lot of people in alternative media just want to be media stars while they never have stamina or keep it up.
[01:05:00.802 --> 01:05:02.264]  They want to just go be stars overnight.
[01:05:02.284 --> 01:05:04.445]  If you want to fight tyranny though, you'll hit pay dirt.
[01:05:04.465 --> 01:05:07.468]  Because the goal, what we want, is freedom.
[01:05:07.548 --> 01:05:08.449]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[01:05:09.548 --> 01:05:19.932]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:05:20.232 --> 01:05:22.093]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:05:22.293 --> 01:05:22.993]  Fluoride!
[01:05:23.173 --> 01:05:24.754]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:05:25.094 --> 01:05:31.416]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:05:31.656 --> 01:05:36.477]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:05:36.597 --> 01:05:42.699]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:05:42.899 --> 01:05:45.079]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:05:45.339 --> 01:05:47.960]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:51.641]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:05:51.761 --> 01:05:56.986]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:05:57.206 --> 01:06:02.010]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[01:06:02.310 --> 01:06:03.351]  I take it every day.
[01:06:03.491 --> 01:06:04.792]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:06:09.475 --> 01:06:12.218]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:06:12.498 --> 01:06:17.323]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:06:17.503 --> 01:06:24.690]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:06:24.810 --> 01:06:30.235]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:06:30.456 --> 01:06:34.159]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:39.004]  We've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:06:39.204 --> 01:06:43.148]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power
[01:06:43.148 --> 01:06:44.428]  More outages are out in the field.
[01:06:44.649 --> 01:06:47.730]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[01:06:47.890 --> 01:06:50.151]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[01:06:50.411 --> 01:06:54.972]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[01:06:55.152 --> 01:06:57.593]  Hand Crank Shortwave AM FM Radios.
[01:06:58.053 --> 01:07:05.036]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at Infowarshop.com and your purchase makes our Infowar possible.

[01:07:07.177 --> 01:07:08.979]  Infowarsshop.com.

[01:07:20.247 --> 01:07:25.290]  Cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:07:25.410 --> 01:07:36.177]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.

[01:08:07.736 --> 01:08:16.065]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:16.425 --> 01:08:18.707]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:22.978 --> 01:08:29.804]  Here are some of the bombshell articles up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com right now.
[01:08:30.705 --> 01:08:37.470]  NSA employee brags about how cool and awesome Spy on Innocent People is.
[01:08:38.391 --> 01:08:47.073]  The latest leak exposes how government agents hunt network system administrators to get data, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:47.413 --> 01:08:48.934]  Amazing article we're going to be breaking down.
[01:08:49.354 --> 01:08:49.874]  Here's another one.
[01:08:49.914 --> 01:08:51.054]  Connecticut State Police.
[01:08:51.414 --> 01:08:52.114]  Some good news.
[01:08:52.635 --> 01:09:01.677]  No door-to-door gun confiscations because there's now big protests forming, people burning their registration forms by the thousands in public.
[01:09:02.357 --> 01:09:05.718]  The public is arming and saying, come for our guns, we're ready for war.
[01:09:07.503 --> 01:09:14.388]  By the way, you know, the whole 1775-1776 began in Massachusetts, in Connecticut, in those areas.
[01:09:14.929 --> 01:09:18.992]  So people understand that we have a lawless government.
[01:09:19.693 --> 01:09:23.035]  People understand that all of this is happening and unfolding.
[01:09:23.936 --> 01:09:28.099]  And so Connecticut State Police say, authorities downplay concerns over new law.
[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:31.182]  Now, they are starting to raid people that didn't turn their guns in.
[01:09:32.325 --> 01:09:34.967]  And so they just want to keep it quiet and say there is no assault, it's not happening.
[01:09:35.348 --> 01:09:50.561]  And what started all this was a Mikhail Phelan article a few weeks ago in an Anthony Gucciardi video report that went viral, that picked up all the big gun sites, where the police were bragging online they can't wait to kick down doors and basically bloody the noses of gun owners.
[01:09:51.061 --> 01:09:54.304]  So they can't wait for the Civil War to start and destroy the country.
[01:09:56.311 --> 01:09:59.972]  Be like not being able to wait to jump into a wood chipper is how I describe it.
[01:09:59.992 --> 01:10:01.493]  I have no hatred of police.
[01:10:02.233 --> 01:10:06.474]  Actually a lot like most police I run into or have gone hunting with over the years growing up as a kid.
[01:10:07.934 --> 01:10:10.975]  And the shooting contest I've been part of with police many times.
[01:10:11.375 --> 01:10:12.776]  I actually get along with cops on average.
[01:10:12.836 --> 01:10:14.016]  They're funny, nice people.
[01:10:15.136 --> 01:10:16.177]  I don't dislike police.
[01:10:16.217 --> 01:10:19.778]  I really don't want to see the police put in a civil war.
[01:10:20.498 --> 01:10:25.241]  That the globalists want to start to wipe out the liberty movement and then bring in foreign troops in the second wave.
[01:10:25.281 --> 01:10:29.124]  That is the official Rand Corporation plan, part of the National Stability Force.
[01:10:29.584 --> 01:10:34.528]  That's why they've got the police training with the military in every city, every major city, to take on gun owners and the Tea Party.
[01:10:36.029 --> 01:10:39.891]  And it's been a big wake-up call for police to now be trained to take us on.
[01:10:40.812 --> 01:10:43.073]  I told you they were training the military, now they're training you.
[01:10:45.489 --> 01:10:59.394]  You know, my children listen to, focus on the family, Christian audio books, and they love, all three of my children, my two daughters and my son, they love a particular one called Adventures in Odysseys.
[01:11:00.155 --> 01:11:08.498]  But I may not be able to, they're the ones that got shot up by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a supporter said he did it for them, the court ruled that it was indeed Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:11:08.938 --> 01:11:13.060]  It's pretty mild, mainline, conservative Christianity, but
[01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:18.323]  The system targets it and now I monitor occasionally what they're listening to.
[01:11:18.383 --> 01:11:33.252]  It's now gun owners are terrorists and the main suspects in terror attacks are people that live in the woods at homeschool and who don't want to turn their guns in and the feds raid them and take them to jail for brewing illegal whiskey.
[01:11:33.973 --> 01:11:38.276]  I actually recorded that, you think I'm joking, last night off of
[01:11:39.997 --> 01:11:42.378]  Last night, on my iPhone, off of Adventures in Odyssey.
[01:11:42.399 --> 01:11:43.699]  In fact, maybe I should just air it right now.
[01:11:43.719 --> 01:11:50.924]  I was intending to give this to the guys and do a whole, whole video report, but in the interest of going to calls, I'll just do a video report on this, maybe, maybe Sunday or something.
[01:11:50.944 --> 01:11:53.365]  I'll go do it today and then air it Sunday, or maybe the Nightly News tonight.
[01:11:54.186 --> 01:12:04.372]  Uh, but, um, I've got it right here, where the Adventures in Odyssey... Let me just pull it up.
[01:12:06.734 --> 01:12:07.354]  Here, I've got it right here.
[01:12:09.322 --> 01:12:10.322]  And I'm seeing it everywhere.
[01:12:10.702 --> 01:12:13.083]  Every drama, every cartoon, everywhere.
[01:12:13.123 --> 01:12:14.543]  The gun owners are the terrorists.
[01:12:15.023 --> 01:12:18.724]  Literally wearing three-corner hats in a bunch of shows I've seen, like Green Lantern and you name it.
[01:12:19.304 --> 01:12:24.065]  The superheroes fight guys in tri-corner hats that look like George Washington who are going to kill all the children.
[01:12:25.365 --> 01:12:26.686]  I mean, that's what they're trying to do.
[01:12:26.886 --> 01:12:27.466]  It's not working.
[01:12:27.706 --> 01:12:30.066]  I see tri-corner hats at regular parties now.
[01:12:31.026 --> 01:12:32.307]  I see people wearing them on the streets.
[01:12:32.727 --> 01:12:33.847]  I see women wearing them.
[01:12:33.927 --> 01:12:35.487]  I see people wearing Patriot apparel.
[01:12:35.867 --> 01:12:38.108]  All the people that I know moving here from California,
[01:12:39.099 --> 01:12:43.681]  If you go out to a rockabilly club or something, the women are all dressing like they're in the country.
[01:12:43.701 --> 01:12:44.662]  They all want to go shooting.
[01:12:45.582 --> 01:12:46.783]  The men all want to go shooting.
[01:12:47.143 --> 01:12:48.924]  And they all hate Obama and are waking up.
[01:12:48.944 --> 01:12:50.245]  And they're not even really conservative.
[01:12:50.565 --> 01:12:51.645]  They're just deprogramming.
[01:12:51.945 --> 01:12:58.949]  So maybe, instead of the globalists taking over California with all their propaganda, maybe they're going to come to Texas and convert to Texans.
[01:12:59.029 --> 01:13:01.790]  I don't know.
[01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:05.212]  But all I can say is you're losing, New World Order.
[01:13:06.513 --> 01:13:06.973]  Listen to this.
[01:13:10.287 --> 01:13:15.053]  Gene got to us, confirmed that it was Buck Oliver at the site where Monty was kidnapped.
[01:13:15.394 --> 01:13:18.438]  And better than that, the fingerprints on the backpack.
[01:13:18.518 --> 01:13:21.021]  Those were Monty's and Dirtbag's.
[01:13:21.502 --> 01:13:25.247]  And the rest of it had been wiped clean, except a partial print.
[01:13:25.247 --> 01:13:27.108]  In a corner of the plastic wrap around the money.
[01:13:27.349 --> 01:13:28.149]  I remember that.
[01:13:28.209 --> 01:13:30.071]  It didn't match anyone in your system.
[01:13:30.131 --> 01:13:33.553]  Eugene also gave us a glass of lemonade that Buck handled.
[01:13:33.613 --> 01:13:36.816]  His fingerprint looks like it matches the partial print.
[01:13:37.436 --> 01:13:39.958]  That means he handled the wrap, if not the money.
[01:13:40.418 --> 01:13:42.600]  Buck is working at my shop this afternoon.
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:45.562]  Which is why I need your people to keep an eye on him until I get there.
[01:13:45.882 --> 01:13:46.623]  Where will you be?
[01:13:46.723 --> 01:13:48.524]  I'm off to another lead.
[01:13:48.885 --> 01:13:50.486]  A place called the Old Roscom.
[01:13:51.066 --> 01:13:52.947]  Ah, that's near Trickle Lake.
[01:13:53.327 --> 01:13:54.768]  Tell me what you know about it.
[01:13:54.808 --> 01:14:05.012]  Well, old Ken Ross was a militant militia conspiracy theory type who built a whole compound to keep the enemy out, which was just about everyone.
[01:14:05.572 --> 01:14:10.614]  He was arrested after federal agents caught him making bootleg whiskey, and now he's in jail.
[01:14:10.954 --> 01:14:13.355]  They also found an entire arsenal of weapons.
[01:14:13.455 --> 01:14:17.657]  Yeah, and I'll wager there's an entire arsenal of counterfeit money up there now.
[01:14:19.141 --> 01:14:19.641]  There you go.
[01:14:19.741 --> 01:14:22.482]  Guns are associated with counterfeit money and illegal whiskey.
[01:14:23.342 --> 01:14:24.982]  And you can listen to these episodes.
[01:14:25.002 --> 01:14:26.663]  They glorify the FBI and stuff.
[01:14:26.943 --> 01:14:28.403]  But overall, they're pretty wholesome.
[01:14:28.563 --> 01:14:29.143]  Not anymore.
[01:14:29.843 --> 01:14:31.223]  Suddenly, they're anti-gun.
[01:14:32.124 --> 01:14:38.905]  Adventures in Odyssey is an evangelical Christian radio drama and comedy series created and produced by a focus on the family.
[01:14:39.265 --> 01:14:41.025]  The series first aired in 1987.
[01:14:41.746 --> 01:14:43.946]  And now, it's run by Obama, obviously.
[01:14:44.626 --> 01:14:47.787]  I mean, it's like every episode's anti-gun now.
[01:14:48.743 --> 01:14:51.744]  So I guess them sending a shooter in there got their attention.
[01:14:55.266 --> 01:14:56.206]  Man, I tell you.
[01:14:57.567 --> 01:14:59.668]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:00.708 --> 01:15:03.049]  I mean, is there nothing I can let my children hear?
[01:15:04.770 --> 01:15:12.193]  Even though the show is pro-police and pro-FBI, I let my kids listen to it because at least the FBI agents in it sound moral and act moral.
[01:15:14.414 --> 01:15:14.954]  Not anymore.
[01:15:15.214 --> 01:15:17.735]  It's just everything is corrupted by this evil.
[01:15:19.042 --> 01:15:21.082]  And that's not the only time I've heard this lately.
[01:15:21.182 --> 01:15:25.103]  So, it's about to be no more Adventures in Odyssey for my children.
[01:15:25.483 --> 01:15:26.524]  Because now I can't trust it.
[01:15:26.564 --> 01:15:32.865]  Now, if they're going to listen to an hour of it while we're driving somewhere, I'm going to have to listen to it.
[01:15:33.905 --> 01:15:38.406]  Because, you know, they'll be in the back with it on a little iPad or something listening to it with headphones.
[01:15:38.466 --> 01:15:39.006]  Not anymore.
[01:15:39.466 --> 01:15:43.007]  I'm going to have to listen to every stinking thing they're allowed to listen to.
[01:15:44.113 --> 01:15:44.873]  And it's outrageous.
[01:15:45.613 --> 01:15:49.434]  So, that's the type of propaganda we're talking about here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:49.774 --> 01:15:52.875]  Continuing, Connecticut State Police, no door-to-door gun confiscations.
[01:15:54.035 --> 01:15:59.536]  Don't trust Google to protect email from the NSA, Curt Nemo, article breaks that down, yeah, because they are the NSA.
[01:16:00.136 --> 01:16:06.037]  Protester crashes live BBC protest, a warrant of pedophile rings at the BBC, we're going to be playing that.
[01:16:06.578 --> 01:16:08.178]  Expert warns the next
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:11.261]  Carrington event will plunge the U.S.
[01:16:11.321 --> 01:16:12.341]  back into the dark ages.
[01:16:12.361 --> 01:16:13.462]  That's a solar flare, folks.
[01:16:14.102 --> 01:16:14.722]  Did the U.S.
[01:16:14.742 --> 01:16:17.383]  deploy snipers against peaceful Occupy protesters?
[01:16:17.423 --> 01:16:18.184]  The answer is yes.
[01:16:19.624 --> 01:16:23.986]  That is just some of the news up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:16:24.066 --> 01:16:28.788]  And I'm going to get to attacks on free speech after we take phone calls.
[01:16:28.829 --> 01:16:30.089]  And then attacks on Rand Paul.
[01:16:30.769 --> 01:16:33.010]  Al Sharpton thinks his speech at Berkeley was racist.
[01:16:33.531 --> 01:16:35.391]  Because it said everybody should come together around freedom.
[01:16:35.912 --> 01:16:38.633]  That scares the race hustling pimps really bad.
[01:16:39.635 --> 01:16:43.861]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rob in Massachusetts.
[01:16:43.941 --> 01:16:44.822]  You're on the air.
[01:16:44.882 --> 01:16:45.182]  Welcome.
[01:16:45.963 --> 01:16:46.965]  How's it going, Alex?
[01:16:47.265 --> 01:16:47.826]  Pretty good, brother.
[01:16:48.905 --> 01:16:49.486]  Yeah, man.
[01:16:49.886 --> 01:16:52.448]  So, like, I've called, uh, I haven't called for years.
[01:16:52.468 --> 01:16:54.591]  I'm gonna tell you, I've been listening for many, many years.
[01:16:54.671 --> 01:17:01.017]  But, uh, last time I think I was talking to you with Eustace Mullins, uh, the Curse of Canaan writer.
[01:17:01.637 --> 01:17:10.326]  And, um, yeah, I've been doing a lot of research into epigraphy, you know, archaeology, and interpreting ancient inscriptions.
[01:17:11.033 --> 01:17:18.980]  Well, I go all the way back to Genesis, and I'm stuck there, for one main reason that's going to be of interest to you and your listeners, and that's the New World Order.
[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:20.941]  It's actually mentioned in the Bible.
[01:17:21.882 --> 01:17:31.710]  I have a copy of the Jerusalem Bible, and that originally came out in 1966, with some new slants of English language for readers.
[01:17:32.871 --> 01:17:37.015]  It actually is Genesis chapter 9, and the heading is the New World Order.
[01:17:37.655 --> 01:17:39.257]  So if your readers can go to that,
[01:17:39.907 --> 01:17:44.711]  Or if you can go to that, it wouldn't take long to research just getting a copy of that Bible.
[01:17:44.731 --> 01:17:48.454]  It's not the Gideon Bible, not the King James Version.
[01:17:48.495 --> 01:17:51.117]  We've got limited time here, sir, to discuss different Bible versions.
[01:17:52.898 --> 01:17:56.081]  What's the providence of the Jerusalem Bible in that interpretation?
[01:17:56.381 --> 01:18:01.466]  I mean, you read the Bible, it's all about corrupt empires rising and countries going into bondage.
[01:18:01.606 --> 01:18:07.271]  I mean, it just absolutely is valuable info to decipher what's happening today.
[01:18:08.319 --> 01:18:13.743]  If you see it in print, in bold letters, as a heading of Chapter 9 of Genesis, it's called the New World Order.
[01:18:14.043 --> 01:18:15.204]  I mean, that is the heading.
[01:18:15.324 --> 01:18:16.625]  Is that translated out of the Greek?
[01:18:18.227 --> 01:18:18.547]  It is.
[01:18:19.007 --> 01:18:19.368]  It is.
[01:18:19.908 --> 01:18:22.110]  Well, actually, the Old Testament was in Hebrew.
[01:18:22.350 --> 01:18:24.932]  But see, the Hebrew scholars... But the Hebrew got translated into Greek.
[01:18:25.593 --> 01:18:30.757]  Yeah, but the Hebrew scribes, they translated everything from the original Sumerian and Babylonian.
[01:18:30.777 --> 01:18:31.237]  No, I understand.
[01:18:31.277 --> 01:18:33.999]  I just said you can find a Bible translation.
[01:18:34.019 --> 01:18:35.160]  It'll basically tell you anything you want.
[01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:36.341]  There's so many different versions of it.
[01:18:36.361 --> 01:18:37.442]  That's why I don't get into the whole deal.
[01:18:38.331 --> 01:18:40.012]  I don't understand that.
[01:18:40.112 --> 01:18:45.173]  I disagree with you about something you said, you know, recently about Superman.
[01:18:45.793 --> 01:18:48.594]  The new movie that just recently came out, The Man of Steel.
[01:18:49.274 --> 01:18:55.516]  I didn't think it was a good influence on kids, and that was because it showed Superman stealing and killing.
[01:18:55.956 --> 01:19:04.699]  Well, Superman broke the drone, and he was against eugenics, and against centralized government, and against rewriting the genetic code of the earth, and killing everybody.
[01:19:05.519 --> 01:19:07.219]  And he didn't trust the federal government.
[01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:10.380]  I mean, the new Captain America is about that.
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:12.481]  About a rogue group staging terror attacks.
[01:19:12.961 --> 01:19:16.141]  I mean, I thought compared to most of the propaganda you see, I thought it had a really good message.
[01:19:16.981 --> 01:19:21.402]  It had that message, but looking back on it, I don't get a good feeling of the memories of it.
[01:19:21.462 --> 01:19:21.922]  Sure, sure.
[01:19:21.942 --> 01:19:23.523]  Well, I mean, who did he kill?
[01:19:25.423 --> 01:19:25.603]  Right.
[01:19:26.063 --> 01:19:28.844]  He only killed Zod because he was about to kill a bunch of innocent people.
[01:19:29.537 --> 01:19:31.139]  Well, I think we should then send him back to Krypton.
[01:19:31.159 --> 01:19:31.579]  We should.
[01:19:31.619 --> 01:19:32.200]  I think we should.
[01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:32.601]  God bless you.
[01:19:32.621 --> 01:19:33.482]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:19:50.339 --> 01:19:52.380]  It doesn't mean I endorse everything in the movie.
[01:19:52.401 --> 01:19:56.543]  I was just saying, I'm seeing... The movie Up, I thought, had a wholesome message.
[01:19:56.624 --> 01:20:00.747]  I mean, I just... We've got to say what's wholesome in the system versus what's bad.
[01:20:00.787 --> 01:20:01.927]  We can't just say it's all bad.
[01:20:02.288 --> 01:20:05.010]  We have to say what we see is good so the good gets promoted.
[01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:07.672]  Like, I want to be able to say Adventures in Odyssey is good.
[01:20:08.132 --> 01:20:08.552]  It's not.
[01:20:08.652 --> 01:20:09.493]  I think Obama runs it.
[01:20:09.893 --> 01:20:13.294]  We are not here to scare you, or fill your mind with images of terror.
[01:20:13.554 --> 01:20:14.695]  There's enough of that already.

[01:23:09.144 --> 01:23:09.524]  Hi there.
[01:23:10.145 --> 01:23:11.205]  My name is Frank Bates.
[01:23:11.666 --> 01:23:14.888]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[01:23:15.488 --> 01:23:24.274]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[01:23:24.634 --> 01:23:30.658]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[01:23:31.339 --> 01:23:32.920]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:38.624]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[01:23:39.344 --> 01:23:46.428]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[01:23:47.288 --> 01:23:52.191]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[01:23:52.851 --> 01:23:58.754]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[01:23:59.355 --> 01:24:04.697]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:24:05.078 --> 01:24:06.338]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[01:24:17.290 --> 01:24:20.613]  It's Friday, the 21st day of March, 2014.
[01:24:20.733 --> 01:24:24.035]  The U.S.S.S.
[01:24:25.036 --> 01:24:27.518]  Infowars is cruising in enemy territory.
[01:24:28.078 --> 01:24:30.820]  We've been destroying some of their biggest lies and propaganda.
[01:24:31.521 --> 01:24:34.863]  We're continuing to seek out enemy vessels and attack them.
[01:24:38.226 --> 01:24:39.887]  I appreciate all of you joining us.
[01:24:40.899 --> 01:24:42.522]  We're going back to your phone calls here.
[01:24:43.183 --> 01:24:46.309]  When I take totally open phones, some of them are incredible, some of them are weird.
[01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:49.855]  We went from the Bible and the Jerusalem translation to Superman.
[01:24:49.875 --> 01:24:51.197]  But it was an interesting call.
[01:24:52.250 --> 01:24:55.972]  We've gone from the police are allowed to be with hookers in Hawaii but no one else is.
[01:24:56.592 --> 01:24:58.313]  I think government should be above the law.
[01:24:58.333 --> 01:25:07.538]  I think it's great that big banks are allowed to bring in the drugs, own the aircraft it's shipped in in, have police, military guard it when the drugs are brought off, and then if you get caught with them you go to jail.
[01:25:07.558 --> 01:25:08.819]  I think that's totally reasonable too.
[01:25:09.519 --> 01:25:12.321]  I think it's great Obama's above the law as well.
[01:25:13.381 --> 01:25:14.262]  I'm being sarcastic.
[01:25:14.442 --> 01:25:15.623]  The toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:25:18.911 --> 01:25:22.614]  Now, I'm not going to be able to get to all the calls if I don't go quick, so each caller one minute.
[01:25:22.934 --> 01:25:29.020]  Terry, and then we're going to go to Scott, then we're going to go to Michael, then we're going to go to Brian, then we're going to go to Pax.
[01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:30.321]  Terry, you're on the air.
[01:25:30.361 --> 01:25:30.661]  Go ahead.
[01:25:30.681 --> 01:25:32.362]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:25:32.763 --> 01:25:33.303]  Alright, brother.
[01:25:34.264 --> 01:25:35.545]  You're doing a great job there, man.
[01:25:35.845 --> 01:25:44.533]  I had to go into Connecticut for a job interview Wednesday, and when I came out to get the car, the guy was in the parking lot at the machine getting his parking ticket.
[01:25:45.163 --> 01:25:51.166]  And I told him, I pointed to the license plate and I said, hey, you guys are going to have to take Constitution off your license plate.
[01:25:51.707 --> 01:25:54.188]  And he just looked at me with six heads.
[01:25:54.288 --> 01:25:55.769]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[01:25:55.829 --> 01:26:02.032]  I mean, the Constitution state or whatever, I mean, that's illegal to have a dirty word like that.
[01:26:02.072 --> 01:26:06.134]  I mean, they're demonizing that in federal and state court, saying they don't want to hear the word Constitution.
[01:26:06.775 --> 01:26:11.037]  And so all these states that talk about liberty and Constitution, they've got to get those dirty words down.
[01:26:12.708 --> 01:26:18.673]  It might be a good idea for you to make up a Connecticut license plate with the communist state on it to place you on the program.
[01:26:19.194 --> 01:26:21.616]  I think that would be more accurate, wouldn't it?
[01:26:22.496 --> 01:26:25.859]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:26:25.879 --> 01:26:26.840]  Just one more thing.
[01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:36.208]  I used to commute to New York City, and you wouldn't believe how many FEMA train cars that I see in the rail yards there.
[01:26:37.202 --> 01:26:38.523]  And nobody has a clue what they are.
[01:26:38.763 --> 01:26:42.224]  There's a massive hundred multi-billion dollars.
[01:26:42.304 --> 01:26:43.725]  I mean, it's hundreds and hundreds of billions.
[01:26:44.065 --> 01:26:44.666]  No one knows.
[01:26:45.106 --> 01:26:46.747]  Massive shadow government build-up.
[01:26:47.067 --> 01:26:52.849]  And then the manuals for the grunt troops are veterans, gun owners, George Washington's not good.
[01:26:52.869 --> 01:26:53.710]  I mean, this is in the news.
[01:26:54.290 --> 01:26:57.852]  So, there's a giant secret army being trained for war with us.
[01:26:58.392 --> 01:27:01.253]  And even Forbes reports the war against the Tea Party.
[01:27:01.293 --> 01:27:03.154]  How the Pentagon's training to fight its new enemy.
[01:27:03.915 --> 01:27:06.296]  It's not the Russians, it's not the Chinese, it's not Al-Qaeda.
[01:27:07.682 --> 01:27:09.966]  It's John Wayne, folks, literally.
[01:27:11.829 --> 01:27:17.920]  I've never believed, I'm 62 years old, I never believed I'd see the country turn into what it's turned into today.
[01:27:18.393 --> 01:27:28.183]  Well, I mean, look, there's a lot of great young people that are awake, but there's also a lot of them that literally believe Obamacare is good, they believe turning their guns in are good, they don't know where their state capitol is.
[01:27:28.203 --> 01:27:29.104]  I mean, I'm not trying to be mean.
[01:27:29.324 --> 01:27:35.090]  People see the spelling bee numbers, they see the, you know, the national studies where people don't know that the earth orbits the sun.
[01:27:35.971 --> 01:27:40.876]  A lot of people that grew up on television are so stupid, the power structure knows that.
[01:27:41.801 --> 01:27:44.442]  So they're making their move saying your kids don't belong to you.
[01:27:44.502 --> 01:27:45.562]  World government's good.
[01:27:45.582 --> 01:27:47.902]  You know, being poor is good.
[01:27:48.522 --> 01:27:49.763]  Government is above the law.
[01:27:50.543 --> 01:27:52.303]  And the yuppies go, government is above the law.
[01:27:52.323 --> 01:27:53.043]  I mean, that's what they're into.
[01:27:53.083 --> 01:27:53.784]  God bless you, brother.
[01:27:54.504 --> 01:27:58.125]  But at least the police up in Connecticut are claiming they're not going to have a mass gun confiscation.
[01:27:58.525 --> 01:28:01.145]  They're just going to target gun owners one by one and have their way with them.
[01:28:02.386 --> 01:28:04.486]  So they're not ready for a full-out offensive yet.
[01:28:04.566 --> 01:28:05.506]  But they will, don't worry.
[01:28:06.046 --> 01:28:07.607]  Scott in New York.
[01:28:07.647 --> 01:28:08.747]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:28:09.701 --> 01:28:10.682]  Hey Oz, can you hear me?
[01:28:10.983 --> 01:28:11.663]  Yes, sir, brother.
[01:28:12.604 --> 01:28:13.065]  Oh, right.
[01:28:13.105 --> 01:28:13.485]  Hey, great.
[01:28:13.506 --> 01:28:23.617]  Hey, you know, I was on your show a few years ago when I protested at Ground Zero and I got arrested by the NYPD and they put me in jail for a day.
[01:28:23.898 --> 01:28:26.080]  I've been arrested by them for demonstrating as well.
[01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:28.824]  It's quite fun, the things they did to me in jail.
[01:28:29.818 --> 01:28:31.301]  Oh, I enjoyed it myself.
[01:28:31.762 --> 01:28:41.580]  I especially enjoyed the part where we won a case against them in federal court and sued them for $15,000 and made them pay for their crimes.
[01:28:43.257 --> 01:28:47.179]  You know, I know a lot of people, including our office, that has won big settlements with police departments.
[01:28:47.199 --> 01:28:47.660]  They don't care.
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:48.660]  It's just citizen money.
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:50.721]  They just roll right, old ladies, more tickets.
[01:28:51.282 --> 01:28:52.583]  And we don't want the money.
[01:28:52.683 --> 01:28:57.746]  We just want them to stop marching up to you when you're on the camera on the sidewalk screaming, turn your camera off.
[01:28:58.506 --> 01:29:05.350]  And then even if you do what they say, they take you to jail and then beat you up or do other things to you.
[01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:08.432]  And it's all funny to them, destroying their own children's future
[01:29:09.338 --> 01:29:10.861]  That's their First Amendment too.
[01:29:11.022 --> 01:29:13.527]  Why would the New York PD want to trample on their own freedom?
[01:29:14.810 --> 01:29:19.572]  Well, I suppose that's true, you know, the part about them, you know, using taxpayer money to pay the fines.
[01:29:19.632 --> 01:29:21.353]  You know, I never really thought about it that way.
[01:29:21.373 --> 01:29:26.795]  I always, you know, I thought that we were, like, you know, doing a good thing by making them pay for what they did.
[01:29:26.875 --> 01:29:30.857]  Oh, no, no, you have to sue them when it's... In fact, I should sue the Sheriff's Department.
[01:29:30.877 --> 01:29:31.417]  I said I would.
[01:29:31.437 --> 01:29:32.197]  I'm just so busy.
[01:29:32.817 --> 01:29:35.719]  Clearly, we were authorized to be there by the Dallas police.
[01:29:35.799 --> 01:29:37.159]  The feds had federalized them.
[01:29:37.459 --> 01:29:38.780]  They sent them over to rough us up.
[01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:41.021]  And when I saw them push this little girl over,
[01:29:41.821 --> 01:29:46.486]  That's when I said, alright, I started taking my jacket off, I said, let's beat their ass, and then they backed off.
[01:29:47.227 --> 01:29:48.228]  I mean, it's all on tape.
[01:29:48.308 --> 01:29:49.028]  I mean, I just couldn't.
[01:29:49.068 --> 01:29:49.689]  I said, that's it.
[01:29:49.729 --> 01:29:51.951]  I can't let them beat up a six-year-old girl.
[01:29:52.652 --> 01:29:53.533]  And then they backed off.
[01:29:54.374 --> 01:29:56.215]  They looked pretty mean, too, those thugs they hired.
[01:29:56.556 --> 01:29:57.156]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:58.938 --> 01:29:59.819]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:01.941]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.862 --> 01:30:05.565]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.631 --> 01:30:14.213]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:30:14.353 --> 01:30:17.314]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:30:17.474 --> 01:30:22.696]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:30:23.036 --> 01:30:24.697]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:30:24.957 --> 01:30:26.277]  We are what we eat.
[01:30:26.597 --> 01:30:28.498]  Our food is devoid of nutrition.
[01:30:28.678 --> 01:30:29.578]  We're good to go.
[01:30:54.289 --> 01:31:00.113]  The fight against the New World Order starts with you, and you can't stand against the machine of your sick, tired, and obese.

[01:31:09.458 --> 01:31:12.039]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:17.182]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:31:17.422 --> 01:31:25.306]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:31:25.547 --> 01:31:29.869]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:31:30.089 --> 01:31:33.891]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:31:34.031 --> 01:31:39.734]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:31:39.994 --> 01:31:42.775]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:31:43.155 --> 01:31:48.378]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:19.419]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:32:19.739 --> 01:32:21.581]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:32:21.761 --> 01:32:22.461]  Fluoride.
[01:32:22.641 --> 01:32:24.922]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:32:25.082 --> 01:32:30.884]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:32:31.145 --> 01:32:33.986]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[01:32:34.086 --> 01:32:35.926]  And the results are on record.
[01:32:36.066 --> 01:32:42.189]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:32:42.389 --> 01:32:44.530]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:32:44.810 --> 01:32:47.431]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:32:47.751 --> 01:32:51.132]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:32:51.252 --> 01:32:56.455]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:32:56.675 --> 01:33:01.478]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[01:33:12.344 --> 01:33:12.464]  Inc.
[01:33:12.504 --> 01:33:14.445]  NORAD has declared DEFCON 3.
[01:33:14.485 --> 01:33:15.806]  Scramble all alert aircraft.
[01:33:16.326 --> 01:33:18.127]  I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.
[01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:23.731]  The Whopper spends all its time thinking about World War III.
[01:33:24.271 --> 01:33:25.732]  Target selection complete.
[01:33:25.772 --> 01:33:27.632]  Time-on-target sequence complete.
[01:33:28.492 --> 01:33:34.534]  22 Typhoon-class submarines departing Petropavlovsk, turning southbound at Nordkapp, bearing 095 degrees.
[01:33:34.814 --> 01:33:40.156]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan Air Defense Zone.
[01:33:40.696 --> 01:33:47.037]  From the front lines of the Information War... Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode.
[01:33:47.097 --> 01:33:48.478]  We are at DEFCON 1.
[01:33:50.892 --> 01:33:53.194]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[01:33:53.294 --> 01:33:53.775]  You bet!
[01:33:54.295 --> 01:33:58.459]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:58.599 --> 01:34:01.561]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[01:34:02.702 --> 01:34:04.123]  3... 2... 1... Impact!
[01:34:05.304 --> 01:34:08.947]  Shall we play a game?
[01:34:09.127 --> 01:34:09.768]  How about...
[01:34:15.001 --> 01:34:19.543]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:34:19.843 --> 01:34:21.843]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready.
[01:34:22.143 --> 01:34:23.684]  Awaiting launch codes.
[01:34:23.724 --> 01:34:24.904]  We are on a launch mode.
[01:34:25.364 --> 01:34:28.866]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[01:34:29.286 --> 01:34:33.207]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:34:33.647 --> 01:34:33.987]  We're in!
[01:34:35.148 --> 01:34:36.608]  Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[01:34:36.928 --> 01:34:39.009]  We have Soviet submarine launch detection.
[01:34:39.469 --> 01:34:41.070]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[01:34:41.511 --> 01:34:42.952]  I wish I was like anybody else.
[01:34:43.472 --> 01:34:44.093]  Game to end.
[01:34:44.914 --> 01:34:50.378]  The only winning goal is not to play.
[01:34:51.319 --> 01:35:04.730]  As Bob Dylan says, the globalists play with our lives like we're little toys, or to quote... To quote another song, the generals gather in their masses just like witches at black masses.
[01:35:05.998 --> 01:35:08.761]  They play with our lives just like pawns in chess.
[01:35:09.261 --> 01:35:12.084]  Wait till their judgment day comes.
[01:35:13.685 --> 01:35:15.547]  The politicians never go out and fight.
[01:35:15.987 --> 01:35:17.388]  They only started the wars.
[01:35:20.571 --> 01:35:23.954]  Treating people just like pawns in chess.
[01:35:24.915 --> 01:35:27.558]  Wait till their judgment day comes.
[01:35:31.087 --> 01:35:39.314]  I have ultra-massive First Amendment news that I'm going to cover and then go right back to your phone calls here in just a moment.
[01:35:40.755 --> 01:35:57.049]  First off, it was so popular, 15% off, Supermelt Vitality, that's just eight really high-powered, clean, organic, concentrated herbs that help block the estrogen mimickers, according to the research, and help your glands produce the normal hormones you need.
[01:35:58.021 --> 01:35:59.442]  And it's helped me work out harder.
[01:35:59.782 --> 01:36:01.042]  It's helped me have more stamina.
[01:36:02.043 --> 01:36:04.624]  I'm not the most photogenic person that people can even see on TV.
[01:36:04.664 --> 01:36:05.684]  Man, Alex Jones looks younger.
[01:36:05.724 --> 01:36:06.464]  Alex Jones looks better.
[01:36:07.004 --> 01:36:14.267]  Shane Steiner got so big on it, and then he decided for three weeks to try to cut up himself, you know, by dieting, which he's never been able to do.
[01:36:14.367 --> 01:36:15.788]  And now the guy looks 15 years younger.
[01:36:16.128 --> 01:36:20.830]  He's coming in next week, and he is taking more than the recommended dose, but he swears by it.
[01:36:21.610 --> 01:36:24.311]  And again, we only sell the best stuff out there.
[01:36:24.631 --> 01:36:26.152]  They're putting things in the food and water.
[01:36:26.192 --> 01:36:27.312]  There's environmental issues.
[01:36:27.792 --> 01:36:29.113]  This has had an incredible effect.
[01:36:29.133 --> 01:36:30.093]  You've heard the rave reviews.
[01:36:30.473 --> 01:36:38.376]  Whether it's the nascent iodine, proprietary, only type like it, that helps the glands and has just been so incredible for my mental focus.
[01:36:38.916 --> 01:36:45.339]  Or whether it's the fluoride shield, that's the nascent iodine and five other compounds to detoxify, not just fluoride, but heavy metals and other things.
[01:36:45.819 --> 01:36:46.759]  Reniard reagents.
[01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:48.200]  That's amazing.
[01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:50.541]  You will have a detox effect in the first few weeks.
[01:36:51.061 --> 01:36:52.081]  So consult your doctor.
[01:36:52.101 --> 01:36:53.002]  I mean, this is not a joke.
[01:36:53.022 --> 01:36:53.622]  This is a key later.
[01:36:55.555 --> 01:36:59.939]  And so we've also got the new Silver Bullet, the strongest, most powerful nano-silver we could get produced.
[01:37:00.359 --> 01:37:02.320]  Took us six months to finally get this produced.
[01:37:03.141 --> 01:37:05.603]  So it's the InfoWars Life brand Silver Bullet.
[01:37:06.664 --> 01:37:12.568]  And the laboratory we had make it, it's been around for decades, said it is the most powerful silver they've ever made.
[01:37:12.909 --> 01:37:16.191]  So they insisted, and I agree to have on the bottle, not for regular use.
[01:37:16.832 --> 01:37:18.473]  Consult your physician before you use it.
[01:37:18.813 --> 01:37:24.458]  But with superbugs out there, you know what I've got loaded in my emergency area and in my medicine cabinet?
[01:37:25.270 --> 01:37:25.911]  You guessed it.
[01:37:26.471 --> 01:37:27.232]  Colloidal silver.
[01:37:28.553 --> 01:37:29.293]  Colloidal silver.
[01:37:30.334 --> 01:37:31.035]  Colloidal silver.
[01:37:32.216 --> 01:37:34.278]  And this is a lot stronger than what you can make in your house.
[01:37:34.318 --> 01:37:36.039]  And that's good to have, too, because it's fresh.
[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:39.522]  Infowarslife.com
[01:37:40.834 --> 01:37:45.138]  But we're bringing back after it being gone for a week, because the truck came in yesterday and we've got more.
[01:37:45.659 --> 01:37:49.943]  I don't just believe it when people say, the truck's leaving tomorrow, and you know, we got it produced.
[01:37:50.043 --> 01:37:58.410]  I don't, I don't just, I, I, stuff goes back on sale and, you know, we stop seeing back ordered when the truck shows up, when it's offloaded.
[01:37:59.181 --> 01:38:00.061]  When it's in the warehouse.
[01:38:00.621 --> 01:38:00.941]  It's here.
[01:38:01.362 --> 01:38:02.462]  In the air-conditioned warehouse.
[01:38:03.022 --> 01:38:04.442]  Super male vitality.
[01:38:04.843 --> 01:38:06.903]  15% off right now on your purchase.
[01:38:06.943 --> 01:38:08.103]  Help support the InfoWars.
[01:38:08.484 --> 01:38:10.984]  InfoWarsStore.com will get you the main shopping cart.
[01:38:11.904 --> 01:38:14.405]  But InfoWarsLife.com will take you right to the subsection.
[01:38:14.705 --> 01:38:15.525]  Or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:38:15.545 --> 01:38:17.386]  We're coming out with a super female vitality.
[01:38:22.398 --> 01:38:23.338]  I don't even know that'll be the name.
[01:38:23.438 --> 01:38:28.360]  And it's just, the herbs are tweaked a little bit, because the group thinks this formula might be a little bit better for women.
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:33.182]  All I know is this has more of an effect on women than it does on men, because women are so attacked.
[01:38:33.602 --> 01:38:35.243]  The main hormone attack is targeting them.
[01:38:36.483 --> 01:38:43.846]  And by all the experts we've talked to, from Dr. Blaylock, brain surgeon, you name it, across the board, Sherri Tenpenny, it's targeting women.
[01:38:44.815 --> 01:38:47.137]  It just has the blowback effect on men, the estrogen stuff.
[01:38:48.018 --> 01:38:51.021]  Women, this is like catnip in our experience.
[01:38:51.242 --> 01:38:54.565]  And I'm just saying, warning, it's not a game, it's not a joke.
[01:38:54.625 --> 01:38:56.087]  This is what you're normally supposed to be like.
[01:38:56.527 --> 01:39:00.831]  So, just get a bottle and see what I'm talking about.
[01:39:00.851 --> 01:39:02.333]  I don't sell crud, everybody knows that.
[01:39:02.733 --> 01:39:03.935]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:39:05.576 --> 01:39:05.696]  Now,
[01:39:07.287 --> 01:39:09.188]  This is a really serious situation.
[01:39:09.289 --> 01:39:11.270]  Matt Drudge, in fact, try to pull this up.
[01:39:11.330 --> 01:39:12.091]  I meant to do this.
[01:39:12.451 --> 01:39:17.615]  Just type in, Matt Drudge calls Dianne Feinstein a fascist.
[01:39:17.655 --> 01:39:18.676]  I believe that was the quote.
[01:39:19.416 --> 01:39:20.217]  Or an authoritarian.
[01:39:20.737 --> 01:39:23.959]  Or Matt Drudge lashes out at Senator Feinstein.
[01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:27.082]  I remember that a few months ago when this bill got introduced.
[01:39:27.162 --> 01:39:27.622]  It's passed.
[01:39:29.063 --> 01:39:31.085]  And if you read it, it's all sold like
[01:39:32.179 --> 01:39:34.542]  You know, the Affordable Care Act is going to increase your prices.
[01:39:34.663 --> 01:39:36.225]  Or the Patriot Act is really patriotic.
[01:39:36.245 --> 01:39:38.969]  It destroys America's checks and balances and the whole Bill of Rights.
[01:39:41.032 --> 01:39:44.014]  Well, it's the same thing with this Journalism Protection Act.
[01:39:44.715 --> 01:39:48.018]  It destroys journalists' protections.
[01:39:48.358 --> 01:39:49.719]  There's the headline from WorldNetDaily.
[01:39:50.119 --> 01:39:53.863]  Matt Drudge eviscerates fascist Dianne Feinstein.
[01:39:54.403 --> 01:40:05.392]  New media pioneer Matt Drudge called Senator Dianne Feinstein a fascist after she suggested only real reporters, close quote, deserve protection under the new media shield law.
[01:40:05.892 --> 01:40:07.394]  We already had laws shielding media.
[01:40:07.634 --> 01:40:09.936]  So they're bringing a new law to shield it, which gets rid of the shield.
[01:40:11.144 --> 01:40:15.269]  Comments from Senator Feinstein yesterday on who's a reporter were disgusting.
[01:40:15.369 --> 01:40:19.955]  Drudge tweeted, adding that a 17-year-old blogger is as important as Wolf Blitzer.
[01:40:21.337 --> 01:40:22.318]  Well, yeah, I agree with that.
[01:40:22.338 --> 01:40:26.743]  I mean, Wolf Blitzer is a totally discredited government mouthpiece.
[01:40:30.529 --> 01:40:31.629]  That passed the Senate.
[01:40:31.649 --> 01:40:46.955]  I don't know if it'll pass the House, because you know those nasty Republicans that are trying to repeal Obamacare and trying to save the Second Amendment and trying to protect our borders, those nasty Libertarian Republicans that are fighting with blue blood, John Boehner, aka Boner, aka McGarrett.
[01:40:48.116 --> 01:40:56.339]  I mean, all of this is going on, and I'm telling you, if we didn't have those House Republicans, our goose would be cooked royally.
[01:41:00.572 --> 01:41:03.655]  What do they call it where they stuff multiple animals in them and then roast them, or Treduncan?
[01:41:03.675 --> 01:41:12.302]  You know, you got our kids' future, our financial future, our future, all stuffed into one creature and put in the Obamacare oven.
[01:41:13.102 --> 01:41:17.126]  Well now, here's the article by Kurt Nemo, just went up at Infowars.com.
[01:41:17.586 --> 01:41:21.769]  Senate has voted to pass law shielding corporate journalists.
[01:41:22.970 --> 01:41:23.951]  It doesn't even really do that.
[01:41:24.652 --> 01:41:27.274]  Legislation designed to put damper on alternative media.
[01:41:29.482 --> 01:41:36.328]  And that's a great headline by Kurt, but I would say Senate passes law defining corporate journalists as only media.
[01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:41.333]  Or, I mean, how do you properly, there's no way, it's so horrible.
[01:41:41.974 --> 01:41:43.935]  I guess his headline's right, it just states what they've done.
[01:41:47.359 --> 01:41:48.159]  Senate passes law
[01:41:50.970 --> 01:41:54.973]  Defining journalism, eviscerating new media protections?
[01:41:55.213 --> 01:41:56.654]  I don't know, I guess Kurt's headline's right.
[01:41:57.295 --> 01:42:05.841]  Senate has voted, or Senate has votes, excuse me, I was reading that wrong, to pass law shielding corporate journalists.
[01:42:05.861 --> 01:42:09.184]  So they haven't passed it, but they say they have the votes to be technical and correct there.
[01:42:09.784 --> 01:42:13.027]  Legislation designed to put damper on alternative media.
[01:42:14.383 --> 01:42:16.105]  Then they now say it's a formality to pass it.
[01:42:16.385 --> 01:42:26.256]  New York Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer said today the Senate has the votes to pass a bill that will protect corporate journalists from court-issued demands to reveal their sources.
[01:42:26.696 --> 01:42:31.742]  The White House, Democrats and Independents, and five Republicans in the Senate support passing legislation.
[01:42:32.303 --> 01:42:35.126]  The law will protect, quote, covered journalists
[01:42:36.448 --> 01:42:43.130]  Defined as an employee, independent contractor, or agent of an entity that disseminates news or information according to the Associated Press.
[01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:52.613]  In other words, if the law is enacted, citizen journalists and bloggers not affiliated with corporations may be subpoenaed and forced by law to reveal sources.
[01:42:53.473 --> 01:43:02.936]  The First Amendment does not explicitly protect journalists, however, the 1970s most states had shield laws in place to protect journalists from revealing their sources and going to jail for failure to do so.
[01:43:03.908 --> 01:43:06.470]  Well yeah, if you're exposing criminal or corrupt activity, you're protected.
[01:43:07.170 --> 01:43:17.836]  However, with the rise of the internet journalism outside the controlled arena of establishment and corporate media, the government began to consider making a distinction between citizen journalist and quote, official, that's a quote, or professional journalist.
[01:43:18.497 --> 01:43:20.898]  If passed, there will be two standards of journalism in the United States.
[01:43:21.278 --> 01:43:22.039]  Citizen journalist,
[01:43:23.257 --> 01:43:25.558]  I mean, they always say we're not real media.
[01:43:25.578 --> 01:43:35.644]  I've got 50 crew members and break news every day that goes international, and I'm a recognized news source, but they don't give us press passes to any big major events.
[01:43:35.664 --> 01:43:37.905]  They say, no, no, Infowars is just, we're not issuing it.
[01:43:37.965 --> 01:43:38.906]  No, no, you're not media.
[01:43:39.666 --> 01:43:43.788]  Google says we're not media, has us delisted off news, because we are real news.
[01:43:43.808 --> 01:43:46.950]  And then also I have a pundit hat as a radio host.
[01:43:48.137 --> 01:43:50.300]  And I'm going to get into really key stuff here in a moment.
[01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:57.208]  Citizen journalists and bloggers will be held to one standard as corporate media journalists will be held to another.
[01:43:58.086 --> 01:44:04.268]  The former may go to jail if attempting to protect sources from government intimidation and legal action while they spy on the media.
[01:44:04.548 --> 01:44:06.768]  We should add Drudge's tweet and his warning to this.
[01:44:06.848 --> 01:44:15.071]  Ask Kurt to add, he can show on the World Net Daily article, add Drudge's tweet in a little tweet box and then maybe link to that Pentagon announcement.
[01:44:15.091 --> 01:44:18.271]  They're going to go after the alternative media from four months ago.
[01:44:18.331 --> 01:44:20.292]  Very important article by Kurt Nemo.
[01:44:20.312 --> 01:44:23.673]  Now, we're going to go to your calls in a moment, but that ties into this stack.
[01:44:25.902 --> 01:44:27.524]  This is out of the Daily Caller.
[01:44:27.664 --> 01:44:32.029]  Conservative professor who was denied promotion wins First Amendment lawsuit.
[01:44:33.717 --> 01:44:47.721]  The First Amendment enthusiasts are thrilled that Mike Adams, a criminology professor at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, won his lawsuit against an administration who deemed and denied him a promotion based on his conservative Christian views.
[01:44:48.162 --> 01:44:49.742]  Adams joined the university in 1993.
[01:44:50.342 --> 01:44:51.463]  He was an atheist at the time.
[01:44:52.003 --> 01:44:56.304]  By the year 2000, he had converted to Christianity and became an outspoken political conservative.
[01:44:56.704 --> 01:44:58.605]  He eventually wrote columns for Town Hall.
[01:45:00.618 --> 01:45:03.499]  In 2006, he was denied a promotion.
[01:45:03.539 --> 01:45:07.540]  Administrators were retaliating against him for conservative views, he claimed.
[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:09.640]  The jury agreed because he was able to show proof.
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:14.801]  That's just an example, folks, of how if you're not a total communist, you don't get a job in Hollywood.
[01:45:15.901 --> 01:45:16.902]  Now let's continue here.
[01:45:17.242 --> 01:45:18.082]  Rush Limbaugh.
[01:45:18.102 --> 01:45:18.982]  This is CNN.
[01:45:19.382 --> 01:45:21.723]  They report this, and I actually got my son the book.
[01:45:21.763 --> 01:45:22.923]  I think overall it's a good book.
[01:45:24.798 --> 01:45:32.383]  It's got, you know, the Tea Party folks on the cover, taking over the ship, and it glorifies the founding fathers and free market.
[01:45:32.924 --> 01:45:35.986]  Rush Limbaugh, he's come up with a whole, whole chain of these.
[01:45:36.026 --> 01:45:41.530]  And I was already thinking of this, I want it on record, I'm going to do children books if I ever get the time to get around to it, because this is exactly what I would do.
[01:45:41.930 --> 01:45:43.431]  We have got to reach out to the youth.
[01:45:43.752 --> 01:45:48.255]  But the system has had the public schools and controlled them forever, and they think those children belong to them.
[01:45:49.687 --> 01:45:59.116]  And again, I'm endorsing all of Rush Limbaugh's ideas, but his book, and I've now scanned over it, is night and day compared to what's being taught in the public schools.
[01:46:00.317 --> 01:46:08.025]  I mean, they're teaching Heather has two mommies, George Washington's bad, they teach the military, the founding fathers wouldn't be allowed in today's military.
[01:46:10.299 --> 01:46:19.183]  And now they come out and say, oh my gosh, he's won a preliminary vote for his book to be number one children's book.
[01:46:19.523 --> 01:46:20.043]  Remove it.
[01:46:20.123 --> 01:46:20.483]  Ban it.
[01:46:20.843 --> 01:46:21.303]  It's evil.
[01:46:21.343 --> 01:46:21.824]  It's racist.
[01:46:21.884 --> 01:46:22.544]  It's homophobe.
[01:46:24.659 --> 01:46:26.261]  I mean, these people are book burners, folks.
[01:46:26.281 --> 01:46:27.963]  This is how you burn books high-tech.
[01:46:28.384 --> 01:46:34.772]  This is how you lynch books 21st century, is you don't allow them to be reviewed, covered, seen, or to win awards.
[01:46:34.972 --> 01:46:41.321]  And when they start winning, and when it's set in the queue to go to the finalist phase and win, oh no, you've got to have it removed!
[01:46:42.657 --> 01:46:46.298]  Which is a total Streisand effect of where you try to cover something up and it only makes it bigger.
[01:46:46.598 --> 01:46:48.699]  You people are losing control and you hate it.
[01:46:49.439 --> 01:47:01.863]  And again, if they can take away Rush Limbaugh's book, listen, if there was a communist book that had been selected and being promoted and was being voted to win, I wouldn't say take them out of the running because then you can take my book out of the running.
[01:47:03.204 --> 01:47:06.145]  Don't you understand that these are authoritarian dirtbags, folks?
[01:47:06.545 --> 01:47:07.445]  Listen to this article.
[01:47:08.601 --> 01:47:12.023]  Rush Limbaugh, radio host, conservative firebrand, and Children's Book Author of the Year.
[01:47:12.724 --> 01:47:23.530]  The Children's Book Council and its Every Child Reader program released Thursday their Author of the Year finalists for their annual Children's Tea Choice Book Awards.
[01:47:23.970 --> 01:47:31.355]  Limbaugh is one of the four finalists, and his nomination has promoted outrage on social media, giving the host often incendiary nature.
[01:47:33.283 --> 01:47:36.065]  Rush Revere and the Brave Pilgrims, Time Travel Adventures.
[01:47:36.085 --> 01:47:37.607]  He's written a book about my family, I appreciate it.
[01:47:38.067 --> 01:47:47.515]  Rush Revere and the Brave Pilgrims, Time Travel Adventures and Exceptional Americans, A Time Traveling Tale of Colonial America, and the latest of two books in the Rush Revere series.
[01:47:48.155 --> 01:47:51.358]  And then it goes in to say they want it pulled, and then the groups that want it pulled.
[01:47:55.609 --> 01:47:56.210]  Here's another one.
[01:47:56.230 --> 01:47:59.192]  I mean, they are just going after the First Amendment on every front.
[01:47:59.492 --> 01:48:00.073]  Here's another one.
[01:48:00.573 --> 01:48:02.435]  Rand Paul comes out and calls for unity.
[01:48:03.315 --> 01:48:11.242]  All race, colors, religion, creed, for the First Amendment, for the Fourth, and I don't have the NSA spying on us, that we're all under attack, that Congress is being blackmailed.
[01:48:11.882 --> 01:48:20.509]  Al Sharpton comes out and tries to say he's a racist, or tries to basically lie about what Rand Paul has stood for, and he can't even get the name right.
[01:48:20.770 --> 01:48:23.452]  We're going to play that clip, folks, right now.
[01:48:25.718 --> 01:48:31.004]  Where does Ron Paul get off talking about race and civil rights at all?
[01:48:31.044 --> 01:48:31.705]  Yeah, you own that.
[01:48:31.725 --> 01:48:35.710]  This is the man who once said he would have modified the system.
[01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:37.332]  I want to point out, he calls him Ron Paul.
[01:48:38.253 --> 01:48:39.494]  He can't even read a teleprompter right.
[01:48:40.556 --> 01:48:43.119]  I mean, this guy is a mega race pimp on record.
[01:48:44.616 --> 01:48:47.017]  Do I have to give you the quotes of Al Sharpton about Jews and stuff?
[01:48:47.037 --> 01:48:49.459]  I mean, the point is, this guy's just really a piece of work.
[01:48:50.159 --> 01:48:52.501]  And then he's got the nerve to claim Rand Paul's a racist.
[01:48:52.541 --> 01:48:57.004]  Remember when the Democrats got caught dressing up in, like, hayseed outfits with racist signs?
[01:48:57.724 --> 01:49:00.486]  And then we pointed out that it was no Democratic operatives.
[01:49:00.766 --> 01:49:01.426]  Our listeners did.
[01:49:01.927 --> 01:49:05.129]  And they found the same photo of the guy, and the guy had to admit it was a, quote, joke.
[01:49:05.709 --> 01:49:06.970]  Democrats did that down in Houston.
[01:49:07.210 --> 01:49:10.112]  They go to Tea Party events and dress up in KKK outfits, folks.
[01:49:12.312 --> 01:49:13.993]  Well, that's what the FBI does, running the Klan.
[01:49:14.013 --> 01:49:16.033]  They go out and go to everybody's gun event in a Klan outfit.
[01:49:16.413 --> 01:49:17.814]  This is how they do it, and I'm sick of it.
[01:49:18.094 --> 01:49:21.295]  Let's go back to Al Sharpton, who can't even read a teleprompter.
[01:49:21.875 --> 01:49:27.177]  Where does Ron Paul get off talking about race and civil rights at all?
[01:49:27.717 --> 01:49:33.720]  This is the man who once said he would have modified the Civil Rights Act if he'd been a senator at the time.
[01:49:34.860 --> 01:49:37.701]  Should Woolworth's lunch counter should have been allowed to stay segregated?
[01:49:39.645 --> 01:49:40.466]  Sir, just yes or no?
[01:49:40.486 --> 01:49:46.092]  What I think would happen, what I'm saying is, is that I don't believe in any discrimination.
[01:49:46.332 --> 01:49:54.641]  There's ten different titles, you know, to the Civil Rights Act, and nine out of ten deal with public institutions, and I'm absolutely in favor.
[01:49:55.707 --> 01:50:00.729]  One deals with private institutions and had I been around... Let's hit pause.
[01:50:00.749 --> 01:50:04.311]  That's famous because we've talked to him where they were fading his audio up and down.
[01:50:04.351 --> 01:50:14.155]  They do that and I've been on TV where you can't hear and they're playing stuff in your ear and then he's explaining but you know should Christians have a right to not rent a room to a Satanist?
[01:50:15.476 --> 01:50:17.777]  That's the full article he wrote a few years ago.
[01:50:19.165 --> 01:50:21.348]  And yeah, I should be able to rent a room to who I want.
[01:50:21.708 --> 01:50:26.593]  And sure, there may be racists out there who don't want to rent a room, you know, to somebody they don't like.
[01:50:26.613 --> 01:50:28.836]  There's black racists, white racists, but sure, that's your issue.
[01:50:29.256 --> 01:50:29.837]  Private property.
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:35.624]  They're now telling the Catholic Church they have to pay for abortions and they have to hire Satanists.
[01:50:36.365 --> 01:50:38.026]  Should the Catholic Church be able to say no?
[01:50:38.466 --> 01:50:44.512]  Well, of course, folks, because Congress will make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting free exercise thereof.
[01:50:44.832 --> 01:50:48.115]  The government doesn't have a jurisdiction in your private life.
[01:50:48.616 --> 01:50:52.539]  Do Hopi Indians have to let me show up to one of their dances and take mescaline dance around?
[01:50:52.599 --> 01:50:52.799]  No.
[01:50:53.900 --> 01:50:55.562]  Can the feds arrest them for taking mescaline?
[01:50:55.622 --> 01:50:55.782]  No.
[01:50:56.062 --> 01:50:56.663]  It's their religion.
[01:50:58.942 --> 01:51:00.907]  That's the First Amendment, not what they say it is.
[01:51:00.947 --> 01:51:04.577]  Not what Al Sharpton, he's the boss, he owns the race issue, is doing.
[01:51:04.958 --> 01:51:06.522]  They're very upset about Rand Paul.
[01:51:06.562 --> 01:51:07.745]  They're very scared of him.
[01:51:09.309 --> 01:51:11.090]  Right now at Emergency Essentials.

[01:51:45.108 --> 01:51:48.550]  But is it reasonable to mount a defense without a strong offense?

[01:54:24.194 --> 01:54:34.002]  And then we are going to talk to Mr. Galloway, a member of the UK Parliament, about geopolitics and a bunch of breaking news.
[01:54:34.342 --> 01:54:38.646]  Should we have war crime charges for the Gulf War on Tony Blair and others?
[01:54:39.026 --> 01:54:40.327]  They premeditatedly did lie.
[01:54:40.928 --> 01:54:44.771]  Right now, let's talk to Michael in Florida.
[01:54:44.811 --> 01:54:45.852]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:54:47.202 --> 01:54:53.006]  Hey Alex, I just want to ask you a question about... I listened to you as a college listener.
[01:54:53.026 --> 01:55:08.037]  I just wanted to get your opinion on the status of college education and also if you have any advice for students like me who are kind of aware of what's going on within the government and all this stuff they try to deploy on the college students.
[01:55:08.698 --> 01:55:14.460]  And if you have any advice for any college listeners who are aware of what's going on around here?
[01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:24.763]  Well, they try to get you in a group think, it's a great question, and then make you think that leftist ideology is the only moral ideology, and they try to restrict and ban everybody else.
[01:55:25.103 --> 01:55:30.264]  But then they also deftly act like only conservatism is the only other choice.
[01:55:31.825 --> 01:55:35.286]  Mainline republicanism that's absolutely despicable on many fronts.
[01:55:36.596 --> 01:55:38.298]  So, that's basically it.
[01:55:38.318 --> 01:55:41.682]  There's libertarianism, there's classic liberalism.
[01:55:42.102 --> 01:55:44.986]  You shouldn't let them define what they're setting up as liberal.
[01:55:45.526 --> 01:55:46.768]  Thomas Jefferson was a liberal.
[01:55:47.228 --> 01:55:50.732]  What they promote at the colleges today, predominantly, is the opposite of liberalism.
[01:55:50.772 --> 01:55:51.673]  It's authoritarianism.
[01:55:52.274 --> 01:55:53.756]  So, so much of it is labeling.
[01:55:55.793 --> 01:55:57.514]  And so that's what it goes down to.
[01:55:57.554 --> 01:55:59.635]  They're very anti-man, very anti-family.
[01:56:00.496 --> 01:56:01.657]  They want to domesticate you.
[01:56:02.558 --> 01:56:11.384]  Also, the colleges, most people, I've seen different numbers, but it's over 80% will never get the money back for what they've spent on college in job markets.
[01:56:11.784 --> 01:56:19.230]  Most of the degrees they're giving out are pretty much worthless, unless it's in engineering or in, you know, the law or other areas.
[01:56:19.270 --> 01:56:20.310]  And there's a glut of lawyers.
[01:56:21.551 --> 01:56:23.693]  So there's a lot of problems out there.
[01:56:25.098 --> 01:56:27.761]  And I'm not saying college isn't for everybody.
[01:56:28.181 --> 01:56:43.295]  If you're trying to send your daughter to the best sorority to find the best rich man to marry, or vice versa with your son, it's a great way to send them to the right sorority and keep them in the right families if you want them to marry into wealth.
[01:56:44.716 --> 01:56:53.661]  Or, if you want to go to West Point, you know, if you want to end up being the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, someday you better go to West Point, and your grandpa better have been the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs on top of it.
[01:56:54.841 --> 01:57:01.124]  And then you better also get, you know, three Purple Hearts in combat, and have 160 IQ, and, you know, stuff like that.
[01:57:01.264 --> 01:57:08.147]  But, I mean, there are reasons to go to college, but most of you are there to just pay for the institution, and you're being used.
[01:57:08.167 --> 01:57:09.128]  Does that answer the question?
[01:57:10.205 --> 01:57:11.285]  Yeah, that answers the question.
[01:57:11.305 --> 01:57:20.488]  To me, sometimes school almost seems secondary to me, not because I'm unintelligent, but just because I'm not motivated to do the work that they have.
[01:57:20.788 --> 01:57:27.170]  The most important thing in college is to join the golf team and hang out with the elites so that they know you when you get out of college to get a job.
[01:57:27.991 --> 01:57:30.632]  The most important thing in business and life is social skills.
[01:57:31.232 --> 01:57:37.834]  So if you want to go to college and learn social skills and get into the right groups and hang out with the right people and never screw anyone,
[01:57:39.284 --> 01:57:40.325]  Never cheat anyone.
[01:57:40.345 --> 01:57:41.766]  Never gossip.
[01:57:41.926 --> 01:57:42.887]  Never backstab.
[01:57:42.947 --> 01:57:43.867]  Be a fun person.
[01:57:44.348 --> 01:57:45.248]  You'll be successful.
[01:57:45.569 --> 01:57:47.670]  The degree part means nothing unless you're an engineer.
[01:57:49.752 --> 01:57:54.535]  That's what all these people don't get out there in alternative media that backstab and freak out and act mentally ill all day.
[01:57:54.955 --> 01:57:57.537]  They always wonder why they're not successful and why they're quote blackballed.
[01:57:57.977 --> 01:57:59.058]  No one's blackballed them.
[01:57:59.318 --> 01:58:00.919]  No one associates with losers.
[01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:06.523]  No one associates with this arrested development junior high.
[01:58:06.844 --> 01:58:08.305]  You see it in business everywhere.
[01:58:09.481 --> 01:58:13.602]  Lazy, lying, cheating, delusional, fantasy land stuff.
[01:58:14.923 --> 01:58:22.445]  And if you want to be successful, work hard, be charming, be nice, study the trade publications, and whatever industry you're in, you'll dominate.
[01:58:23.386 --> 01:58:27.527]  Your only problem will be what plums to pick.
[01:58:29.281 --> 01:58:43.788]  Look, anybody can go start in a major boom city a tree trimming company and be very charming to the people's houses you go to and get a good name and you'll be trimming everybody's trees on the block and you're going to live in a half million dollar house and have a crew of 50 people working for you.
[01:58:44.188 --> 01:58:45.909]  I could go do that right now, okay?
[01:58:47.050 --> 01:58:47.410]  Stay with us.
[01:58:47.430 --> 01:58:56.094]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:59.366 --> 01:59:02.707]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[01:59:02.827 --> 01:59:05.068]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[01:59:05.248 --> 01:59:13.552]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[01:59:13.832 --> 01:59:17.153]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[01:59:17.313 --> 01:59:27.577]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:59:27.877 --> 01:59:35.143]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:59:35.323 --> 01:59:37.225]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:59:37.565 --> 01:59:45.071]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:59:45.471 --> 01:59:51.595]  Supermail Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:59:51.895 --> 01:59:58.820]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Supermail Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[02:00:02.482 --> 02:00:04.424]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:04.884 --> 02:00:07.666]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:14.403 --> 02:00:15.043]  Big Brother.
[02:00:15.704 --> 02:00:16.744]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:17.485 --> 02:00:18.565]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:19.245 --> 02:00:20.046]  You want answers?
[02:00:20.826 --> 02:00:21.707]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:22.367 --> 02:00:26.009]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:26.569 --> 02:00:30.671]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:34.613 --> 02:00:35.513]  Pax in Texas.
[02:00:36.394 --> 02:00:38.235]  And we're gonna go to Chad.
[02:00:38.495 --> 02:00:39.695]  Go ahead, Pax, you're on the air.
[02:00:41.796 --> 02:00:42.096]  Hello?
[02:00:42.457 --> 02:00:42.957]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[02:00:44.013 --> 02:00:44.334]  Yes, sir.
[02:00:44.354 --> 02:00:45.415]  I appreciate you very much.
[02:00:45.696 --> 02:00:54.489]  And I just wanted to actually talk about predictive programming in a movie that just came out recently with Liam Neeson called Non-Stop.
[02:00:55.431 --> 02:00:59.297]  And it's basically a federal marshal who does his job.
[02:01:00.175 --> 02:01:05.279]  And, uh, what he ends up doing, basically, is stopping a terrorist attack that gets blamed for it.
[02:01:05.959 --> 02:01:08.401]  Uh, have you had the opportunity to actually see the movie?
[02:01:08.881 --> 02:01:10.342]  No, but that's actually what they do.
[02:01:10.383 --> 02:01:12.684]  The movie Arlington Road is totally accurate.
[02:01:13.024 --> 02:01:21.470]  There's a secret shadow group, you don't even know if they're government or not, uh, and then they trick the professor to show up at a time and place as he's a libertarian to blow up the federal building.
[02:01:22.151 --> 02:01:23.412]  And that's exactly what they do.
[02:01:24.452 --> 02:01:27.514]  And he gets framed for it, basically, because they're terrorists.
[02:01:27.654 --> 02:01:28.314]  No, no, no, no.
[02:01:28.514 --> 02:01:33.056]  They'll tell sheep-dipped military people, go be part of this drill, they'll blow it up and say they did it.
[02:01:33.617 --> 02:01:34.217]  That's what they do.
[02:01:35.322 --> 02:01:36.283]  So check this out, though.
[02:01:36.763 --> 02:01:41.688]  So they, you know, he's watching, casing every, every person that's basically on the flight.
[02:01:41.708 --> 02:01:48.974]  And there's, you know, the standard, you know, token Muslim, basically, who ends up being a doctor, you know, they're going to London, basically.
[02:01:49.314 --> 02:01:54.519]  But the terrorists that end up, and sorry for the spoiler, are basically two
[02:01:56.140 --> 02:01:57.480]  Let me look at this.
[02:01:57.500 --> 02:02:00.021]  There are basically two VA's basically.
[02:02:00.061 --> 02:02:01.161]  There are two veterans.
[02:02:01.701 --> 02:02:02.481]  Oh no, no, listen.
[02:02:02.501 --> 02:02:02.741]  I know.
[02:02:02.761 --> 02:02:06.982]  And there's no veterans doing anything other than maybe committing suicide or killing their neighbor.
[02:02:07.762 --> 02:02:09.463]  Statistically, veterans have very low crime rate.
[02:02:09.503 --> 02:02:10.463]  I have the FBI numbers.
[02:02:10.723 --> 02:02:13.184]  But no, every show, every movie, the veterans are the terrorists.
[02:02:13.524 --> 02:02:14.724]  The branding is total.
[02:02:14.964 --> 02:02:16.544]  The veterans are going to kill everybody.
[02:02:16.564 --> 02:02:19.785]  Because when they purge this country, they're going to try to go after all the veterans.
[02:02:20.105 --> 02:02:20.885]  Disgusting.
[02:02:21.625 --> 02:02:24.346]  I'm going to send my crew out to watch it and do a review of it or I'll do it.
[02:02:25.066 --> 02:02:27.108]  In fact, I've told the crew, we should just, I'll pay for it.
[02:02:28.509 --> 02:02:40.178]  As reporters, they should go out with their boyfriend or their girlfriend or their husband or whatever, their daughter, or whoever, take your family out, your sons, whatever, take them out, see movies every week, I'll pay for the movie ticket.
[02:02:40.959 --> 02:02:42.960]  I'm not going to pay for food or anything.
[02:02:43.561 --> 02:02:46.203]  And go do a review the next day, right when they come out.
[02:02:46.703 --> 02:02:49.365]  Because the real propaganda is going on in the movies.
[02:02:49.406 --> 02:02:49.706]  Go ahead.
[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:56.205]  Totally ridiculous, and that's how they're tying veterans to 9-11 in a roundabout way.
[02:02:56.265 --> 02:02:58.046]  In the official West Point training manuals, the new enemy
[02:03:17.487 --> 02:03:20.649]  Is, veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians.
[02:03:21.029 --> 02:03:24.051]  And the officer corps is being taught how to be total traitors.
[02:03:24.771 --> 02:03:26.192]  I appreciate your call, great points.
[02:03:26.552 --> 02:03:28.333]  Chad in Canada, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:03:28.353 --> 02:03:30.374]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[02:03:30.534 --> 02:03:31.034]  Good, go ahead.
[02:03:32.375 --> 02:03:33.556]  I've got a question for you.
[02:03:34.476 --> 02:03:37.618]  Now, I don't want you to have to answer and burn bridges.
[02:03:37.718 --> 02:03:39.319]  No, I don't care, just ask the question.
[02:03:39.359 --> 02:03:40.880]  I see what you want to ask on screen, go ahead.
[02:03:41.608 --> 02:03:45.449]  Okay, well the question is, I'm just curious, you know, I've been a Coast listener for years.
[02:03:45.489 --> 02:03:47.209]  In fact, that's how I got onto your show.
[02:03:47.969 --> 02:03:52.470]  And when I started listening to Coast, I didn't realize that George Norrie was the host.
[02:03:52.530 --> 02:03:57.971]  I thought John B. Wells was the host because I always found him to do a way better job and to be more informative.
[02:03:58.011 --> 02:04:03.292]  And I'm just curious if you found anything kind of sneaky, suspicious of his release?
[02:04:03.792 --> 02:04:07.953]  And do you think that Coast to Coast is maybe being poked in the backside by the
[02:04:08.763 --> 02:04:09.704]  You know, the elite?
[02:04:09.724 --> 02:04:12.246]  Because of their... You know, here's the deal.
[02:04:12.346 --> 02:04:12.787]  Here's the deal.
[02:04:14.188 --> 02:04:17.671]  I go on coast-to-coast shows that have never been censored for 11 years.
[02:04:17.851 --> 02:04:19.053]  I've reached tens of millions of people.
[02:04:19.433 --> 02:04:21.235]  George Norrie's a total gentleman and a friend of mine.
[02:04:21.795 --> 02:04:26.900]  I like John B. Wells and have met him a few times, had him down at the studio, hung out with him, gone out with him, really nice guy.
[02:04:27.180 --> 02:04:27.620]  I like him.
[02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:28.261]  I love his show.
[02:04:29.022 --> 02:04:30.223]  He does his own private show now.
[02:04:31.801 --> 02:04:34.644]  A. No, he was not released because of censorship.
[02:04:35.444 --> 02:04:40.208]  I can tell you that because I do know the inside baseball, but it's kind of like dishonorable.
[02:04:40.669 --> 02:04:42.370]  Let John B. Wells speak for himself.
[02:04:42.771 --> 02:04:44.572]  I intend to have him back on soon and George Norrie.
[02:04:45.033 --> 02:04:46.394]  I just don't get involved in all this.
[02:04:46.754 --> 02:04:49.837]  He started his own show, didn't tell them about it.
[02:04:50.417 --> 02:04:55.602]  I don't think he thought it was wrong what he was doing, but companies don't want you doing your own thing outside of it, and so they released him.
[02:04:57.475 --> 02:04:58.779]  And I'm not in the middle of that.
[02:04:58.979 --> 02:04:59.941]  I like all of them.
[02:05:00.262 --> 02:05:01.525]  I'm friendly towards all of them.
[02:05:01.926 --> 02:05:02.828]  I stay out of it.
[02:05:02.889 --> 02:05:05.675]  My show is not about the gossip hour.
[02:05:06.517 --> 02:05:06.798]  Okay?
[02:05:09.508 --> 02:05:11.149]  Introducing Pro-1.
[02:05:11.389 --> 02:05:14.911]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[02:05:15.051 --> 02:05:19.454]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:05:19.594 --> 02:05:25.578]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:05:25.698 --> 02:05:36.484]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[02:05:36.684 --> 02:05:42.986]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[02:05:43.167 --> 02:06:00.113]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:06:00.473 --> 02:06:07.457]  Get your Pro-Pure with the new Pro-1 filters today at Infowarsstore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:06:07.557 --> 02:06:10.258]  The facts are in.
[02:06:10.438 --> 02:06:11.559]  The studies are legion.
[02:06:11.839 --> 02:06:19.123]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[02:06:19.343 --> 02:06:22.825]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[02:06:23.185 --> 02:06:23.706]  Simple.
[02:06:23.746 --> 02:06:28.088]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[02:06:28.448 --> 02:06:33.930]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[02:06:34.170 --> 02:06:50.175]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Live Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[02:06:50.495 --> 02:06:54.736]  Let's take a stand against the globalists by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[02:06:55.076 --> 02:06:56.917]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.

[02:07:09.281 --> 02:07:14.869]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[02:07:15.069 --> 02:07:22.299]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[02:07:22.459 --> 02:07:25.583]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[02:07:25.803 --> 02:07:27.603]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[02:07:27.844 --> 02:07:32.405]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[02:07:32.485 --> 02:07:35.245]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[02:07:35.405 --> 02:07:41.187]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[02:07:41.367 --> 02:07:44.828]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[02:07:45.028 --> 02:07:50.089]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[02:07:50.289 --> 02:07:53.270]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:53.510 --> 02:07:59.374]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.

[02:08:16.446 --> 02:08:18.948]  Generals gathered in their masses
[02:08:22.948 --> 02:08:28.990]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:31.490]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:51.839 --> 02:08:55.523]  Poisoning their brainwashed minds.
[02:08:58.486 --> 02:09:02.851]  Well, we have George Galloway on with us for the next 40 minutes or so, 45 minutes or so.
[02:09:02.931 --> 02:09:10.318]  He is a British politician, writer, broadcaster, and Respect Party member of Parliament from Bradford West.
[02:09:11.631 --> 02:09:14.612]  And he is very well known for testifying before the U.S.
[02:09:14.652 --> 02:09:15.152]  Congress.
[02:09:15.192 --> 02:09:20.274]  He is very well known for exposing the Iraq War as a lie and a fraud before it happened.
[02:09:20.654 --> 02:09:23.415]  Then they of course murdered Dr. David Kelly to try to cover that up.
[02:09:23.455 --> 02:09:24.395]  He helped expose that.
[02:09:24.875 --> 02:09:25.756]  He's been pushing for
[02:09:26.716 --> 02:09:31.899]  Tony Blair and others to be held for war crimes, which they clearly have done by every yardstick.
[02:09:32.179 --> 02:09:33.199]  We've had members of the U.S.
[02:09:33.259 --> 02:09:36.081]  Senate look at it and say clearly it's a war crime.
[02:09:36.161 --> 02:09:37.342]  They fixed the intelligence.
[02:09:37.942 --> 02:09:40.323]  The White House memo, the Downing Street memos have all come out.
[02:09:40.363 --> 02:09:40.723]  We know.
[02:09:41.103 --> 02:09:46.246]  Prima facie, cookie, you know, jar, hand in the cookie jar, red-handed, we have them.
[02:09:46.786 --> 02:09:51.189]  So I wanted to get him on about all the wars and funding al-Qaeda to attack Syria.
[02:09:52.569 --> 02:09:58.233]  And Libya, and how Iraq is so much worse off, you know, a decade after the, quote, liberation.
[02:09:58.594 --> 02:10:00.495]  Everything he warned of him was demonized.
[02:10:00.515 --> 02:10:02.276]  I mean, they tried to put him in jail for stuff.
[02:10:02.296 --> 02:10:04.258]  They tried to go after him.
[02:10:05.058 --> 02:10:06.259]  They absolutely hate him.
[02:10:06.819 --> 02:10:09.241]  And he's an amazing orator.
[02:10:09.621 --> 02:10:16.346]  I don't agree with everything he says, but I do agree with the fact that I believe he's a real guy who believes what he's saying and believes he's standing up for human liberty and dignity.
[02:10:16.626 --> 02:10:18.868]  So we've got him on about that and a whole host
[02:10:19.608 --> 02:10:22.309]  of other issues to discuss today.
[02:10:22.429 --> 02:10:30.471]  I want to get his take on the Russia situation, the new Cold War that's getting kicked off right now, and where he sees civilization going.
[02:10:30.531 --> 02:10:37.032]  So, he joins us via video Skype if you're a TV viewer, radio listeners can go to Infowars.com forward slash show to see the free feed.
[02:10:37.452 --> 02:10:38.833]  George, thank you for coming on the show.
[02:10:38.853 --> 02:10:40.353]  It's a pleasure, Alex.
[02:10:40.413 --> 02:10:41.393]  Nice to talk to you again.
[02:10:41.833 --> 02:10:42.894]  Where would you like to start?
[02:10:42.934 --> 02:10:44.154]  There's so much to talk about.
[02:10:45.270 --> 02:10:58.562]  Well, I think the most immediate crisis is the one now in the Ukraine, the Crimea, with Russia and the Cold War beginning to encroach upon our toes.
[02:10:58.642 --> 02:11:06.169]  My toes are feeling distinctly frosty with all the rhetoric, which takes us back to the 1970s, 1980s, and having had a period of honeymoon
[02:11:11.173 --> 02:11:14.996]  Russia appears to be back as public enemy number one.
[02:11:15.696 --> 02:11:22.641]  And the hypocrisy that's being deployed would be laughable if it were not so serious.
[02:11:23.162 --> 02:11:26.164]  In Britain, for example, we have a government
[02:11:26.824 --> 02:11:45.634]  Which in 1982 sailed 7,000 miles all the way to the South Atlantic to defend the rights of self-determination of 2,300 British settlers on what they call the Falkland Islands.
[02:11:46.255 --> 02:11:48.496]  They fought a devastating war in which
[02:11:49.096 --> 02:12:04.903]  Many hundreds were killed, many more were maimed, and billions of pounds in treasure were burned in order to come to the aid of what we said were our compatriots, even though we planted them there in the first place.
[02:12:05.663 --> 02:12:10.265]  Equally, our government, if Spain were to have the temerity
[02:12:10.965 --> 02:12:20.035]  To just severely increase the traffic restrictions on traffic going from Spain to Gibraltar and vice versa.
[02:12:20.556 --> 02:12:29.745]  We'd be ready to go to war with Spain because we say that the rock which is attached to Spain actually belongs to us.
[02:12:30.606 --> 02:12:31.848]  And yet the same government
[02:12:33.146 --> 02:12:59.184]  warns Russia of condemned punishments to come because they intervened to safeguard their vital national interests and millions of their compatriots, Russian nationals, Russian speakers, whose lives and property were very obviously at risk from a Western sponsored and paid for
[02:12:59.984 --> 02:13:08.033]  And logistically armed in every way, coup d'etat in the neighbouring country of Ukraine.
[02:13:09.415 --> 02:13:14.360]  I could go on, but I just will give one more example of the hypocrisy, or perhaps two.
[02:13:15.683 --> 02:13:26.734]  The Kosovo, which is a part of Serbia, declared itself unilaterally to be an independent state.
[02:13:26.774 --> 02:13:34.462]  And 110 countries in the world have recognized it, recognized this self-declared independence.
[02:13:34.783 --> 02:13:35.463]  And guess what?
[02:13:36.269 --> 02:13:42.192]  Both my country and yours are amongst the 110 countries that have recognized it.
[02:13:42.212 --> 02:13:43.552]  And look at South Sudan.
[02:13:43.872 --> 02:13:45.253]  Exactly, look at South Sudan.
[02:13:45.273 --> 02:13:46.213]  Just one more.
[02:13:46.654 --> 02:13:50.695]  Permit me, yes, South Sudan, but permit me one more irony.
[02:13:50.975 --> 02:14:03.161]  John Kerry, with a solemn face, said that we can't have countries invading others and seizing territory on trumped up pretexts.
[02:14:03.601 --> 02:14:05.622]  And he didn't even have the grace to laugh.
[02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:33.579]  When just 11 years ago, exactly yesterday, Britain and the United States, in their shock and awe, invasion and attack on Iraq, began a process which has murdered a million souls, destroyed Iraq, shattered it into pieces, and sent cascading around the world Islamist, fundamentalist, fanatic extremism,
[02:14:34.384 --> 02:14:49.721]  All over the globe, all in the name of Britain and America arrogating to themselves the right to do whatever they please, irrespective of the United Nations or of anything called international law.
[02:14:50.121 --> 02:14:51.343]  You couldn't make it up, Alex!
[02:14:52.429 --> 02:14:54.252]  Incredible the way George Galloway puts it.
[02:14:54.292 --> 02:14:55.133]  Total Veritas.
[02:14:55.193 --> 02:14:55.834]  I agree with you 100%.
[02:14:56.234 --> 02:15:03.724]  And Ron Paul on the Libertarian Right came out and wrote articles and said exactly what you just said, almost word for word, because it is just the truth.
[02:15:04.405 --> 02:15:06.027]  Neither one of you is plagiarizing the other.
[02:15:06.087 --> 02:15:06.908]  It's just the truth.
[02:15:07.589 --> 02:15:10.032]  And they're calling him basically a KGB agent.
[02:15:11.034 --> 02:15:13.637]  They are demonizing me for it.
[02:15:13.657 --> 02:15:14.358]  We just lost his Skype.
[02:15:14.378 --> 02:15:15.259]  We're going to get him back up.
[02:15:15.880 --> 02:15:18.924]  It is insane to sit here and watch this.
[02:15:19.124 --> 02:15:22.208]  And you talk about radical Islam cascading around the world.
[02:15:22.608 --> 02:15:24.050]  What is the larger plan?
[02:15:24.090 --> 02:15:24.851]  That's what I want to ask.
[02:15:25.845 --> 02:15:35.429]  George Galloway, again a member of the Respect Party from Bradford West in the United Kingdom.
[02:15:35.989 --> 02:15:38.791]  And we're going to be talking about some about that party as well today.
[02:15:39.851 --> 02:15:44.033]  Again folks, a new Cold War being launched right now.
[02:15:45.073 --> 02:15:51.996]  A new Cold War being expanded and George just basically broke down the hypocrisy of 11 years later.
[02:15:54.113 --> 02:15:55.954]  What has happened with Iraq?
[02:15:56.095 --> 02:15:59.157]  And if your Skype's not working, guys, just go to telephone.
[02:15:59.857 --> 02:16:01.158]  Back up, we're on a telephone right now.
[02:16:01.238 --> 02:16:01.439]  Good!
[02:16:02.579 --> 02:16:07.103]  Alright, it was bad Skype anyways, but it was good to be able to see him, even though it looked like we were looking at him through a fog.
[02:16:07.123 --> 02:16:16.230]  And that's the beauty of Skype and these technologies that are not yet perfected, but they still, it still is amazing to be able to talk to anybody we want across the world.
[02:16:17.262 --> 02:16:27.107]  And it is the hypocrisy of people like John Kerry that is so staggeringly ridiculous you think it's Dr. Strangelove's satire.
[02:16:28.448 --> 02:16:35.592]  To have him saying you can't just go around invading countries when the Russians are grabbing a small area that's pretty much always been part of Russia.
[02:16:37.515 --> 02:16:39.037]  to secure their pipelines.
[02:16:39.497 --> 02:16:44.302]  Now, sir, continuing, you were getting into Iraq and the cascading radical Islam.
[02:16:44.803 --> 02:16:48.726]  Is there a method to the madness in Syria, in Libya?
[02:16:49.187 --> 02:16:55.994]  Because, I mean, this looks like something the devil would do to just try to wreck any stability.
[02:16:56.254 --> 02:16:57.075]  What's the game plan?
[02:16:57.725 --> 02:16:58.726]  Well, I wish I knew.
[02:16:59.126 --> 02:17:12.399]  I shared a lift with William Hague, the British Foreign Minister, just a week or two ago, and I said to him, William, you've been wrong all of your life, but I've never known you to be actually insane.
[02:17:13.220 --> 02:17:18.001]  Yet the policy you're following in Syria is literally insane.
[02:17:18.521 --> 02:17:29.183]  You have inflated, financed and armed Al-Qaeda in Syria on the principle that your enemy's enemy was your friend.
[02:17:29.923 --> 02:17:42.185]  Yet now you tell us that returning fanatics coming back from Syria, now that they're losing the war, are Britain's number one security concern.
[02:17:43.007 --> 02:17:51.332]  So you've made more dangerous the very people that you say are our number one national security threat.
[02:17:51.852 --> 02:17:55.414]  This has to be defined as insanity, doesn't it?
[02:17:56.957 --> 02:18:02.362]  It is, and I've been following politics for decades but never have seen something this surreal.
[02:18:02.722 --> 02:18:11.190]  Again, George Galloway, member of UK Parliament, one of the most outspoken people in Europe, not just England, against all these wars, proven absolutely right about Iraq and spades.
[02:18:12.171 --> 02:18:19.117]  Where is it going as the open mental illness, the fascist mental illness, just explodes and metastasizes?
[02:18:20.765 --> 02:18:23.147]  Well, it is metastasizing.
[02:18:23.187 --> 02:18:25.849]  That's a very good image to conjure up.
[02:18:26.049 --> 02:18:29.152]  And it is a cancer that has spread all over the world.
[02:18:29.232 --> 02:18:43.543]  And I said this to Tony Blair, man-to-man, outside the gentleman's lavatory, to be precise, in the library corridor of the House of Commons, just a few days before he and George Bush invaded Iraq.
[02:18:44.023 --> 02:18:46.305]  I told him, I think, four or five things.
[02:18:46.345 --> 02:18:46.866]  Number one,
[02:18:47.731 --> 02:18:49.653]  There is no Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
[02:18:50.393 --> 02:18:54.657]  But if you invade it, there will be hundreds of thousands of Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
[02:18:54.877 --> 02:19:02.864]  Number two, the fall of Baghdad will not be the beginning of the end, but merely the end of the beginning.
[02:19:03.665 --> 02:19:07.007]  Number three, the Iraqis will not welcome you with flowers.
[02:19:07.568 --> 02:19:11.051]  They will welcome you with hot lead and fire.
[02:19:11.974 --> 02:19:25.367]  And number four, to believe that Iraqis would welcome a foreign invasion of their country means that you think they love their country less than we love ours.
[02:19:26.008 --> 02:19:33.555]  Because nobody in Britain or the United States would dream of welcoming a foreign invader
[02:19:34.326 --> 02:19:36.247]  And occupier to their country.
[02:19:36.648 --> 02:19:44.133]  And lastly, I said that though there is no Al-Qaeda in Iraq, if you invade, Al-Qaeda will be everywhere.
[02:19:44.614 --> 02:20:02.347]  It will spread everywhere, like a cancer, metastasizing, as you say, all over the globe, because you will fanaticize, radicalize, extremize millions and millions of Muslims who can see the grotesque
[02:20:02.947 --> 02:20:05.909]  Double standard that you are practicing.
[02:20:06.369 --> 02:20:11.253]  Your best friends in the region are the worst dictators in the region.
[02:20:11.973 --> 02:20:17.176]  You are supporting those tyrants, giving them money and weapons where they need them.
[02:20:17.837 --> 02:20:31.666]  And you're supporting Israel, which has for more than 60 years wiped off the map the country that used to be called Palestine and scattered their millions of people all over the globe.
[02:20:34.238 --> 02:20:40.183]  And any way you cut it, it's meant to radicalize Islam, and in the final equation, destabilize the whole region.
[02:20:40.983 --> 02:20:43.205]  You've been really accurate predicting what would unfold.
[02:20:43.285 --> 02:20:50.050]  What do you predict will unfold now in Syria, in Libya, all over the place where the Al Qaeda jihadis are running around?
[02:20:50.570 --> 02:20:59.998]  And now, as you mentioned, your government, other governments are saying, brace for Al Qaeda to attack with surface-to-air missiles that they got in Benghazi, and there's no discussion of why were they given this?
[02:21:00.078 --> 02:21:02.660]  I mean, clearly they're helping create the threat,
[02:21:03.140 --> 02:21:15.311]  To then set up a police state, continent-wide, UK-wide, US-wide, looks to me like they want to use this Al-Qaeda threat that they're funding and supporting to take our liberties.
[02:21:16.189 --> 02:21:17.130]  Well, up to a point.
[02:21:17.370 --> 02:21:26.219]  But the point about the Frankenstein analogy that I keep making is that once you've made the monster, it quickly moves out of your control.
[02:21:26.900 --> 02:21:37.610]  And we found that in the 1980s in Afghanistan, when on the same immoral principle that my enemy's enemy is my friend, we supported the fathers of these
[02:21:38.231 --> 02:21:42.912]  ...current extremists in the so-called Mujahideen in Afghanistan.
[02:21:42.952 --> 02:21:56.217]  We gave them guns, we gave them money, which they later deployed against us, and most atrociously in the United States of America, but also in London, in Madrid, and elsewhere.
[02:21:56.297 --> 02:22:06.960]  So, the point about Frankenstein is you've got to read it to the end, because you then realize that Dr. Frankenstein's monster turned on his creator.
[02:22:07.740 --> 02:22:29.975]  And whilst a bit of a threat of fanaticism or communism or Russia can be useful to the military-industrial complex, to the security state apparatuses who wish to bolster their budgets, give themselves more power and centrality in the state, only up to a point.
[02:22:30.576 --> 02:22:36.580]  Because once you've made this enemy more powerful, as we've done with the fanatics,
[02:22:37.168 --> 02:22:40.512]  Then you are in very real and present danger from them.
[02:22:41.072 --> 02:22:45.157]  They have come up, though, against some serious reality.
[02:22:45.838 --> 02:22:50.303]  The Syrian people have rejected their jihad.
[02:22:50.783 --> 02:22:56.270]  They have stuck by their regime, even where they may hate their regime.
[02:22:56.870 --> 02:23:00.552]  And there are many good reasons to hate the Syrian regime.
[02:23:01.273 --> 02:23:12.200]  But the Syrian people will never agree to live under an Islamist code that owes more to Bin Laden, owes more to Afghanistan than it ever could.
[02:23:12.760 --> 02:23:22.026]  To a sophisticated, civilized, Levantine population where people mix, men and women, Christians and Muslims,
[02:23:22.586 --> 02:23:27.490]  Where the minority religions are protected and cherished and so on.
[02:23:27.870 --> 02:23:32.373]  And that's the way the majority of people in Syria want it to continue.
[02:23:32.853 --> 02:23:35.235]  So, they have stuck by their government.
[02:23:35.695 --> 02:23:37.276]  The state has not broken.
[02:23:37.737 --> 02:23:39.258]  The army has not broken.
[02:23:39.838 --> 02:23:40.218]  Well, sure.
[02:23:40.599 --> 02:23:40.859]  Well, sure.
[02:24:09.622 --> 02:24:13.507]  Libya is another example that you have raised a couple of times.
[02:24:14.287 --> 02:24:23.518]  They painted Gaddafi as a foolish, brutal, idiotic dictator, and he was!
[02:24:24.319 --> 02:24:30.165]  But they have managed, with an act of genius, to make Libya worse!
[02:24:31.764 --> 02:24:34.345]  Under their so-called liberators.
[02:24:34.365 --> 02:24:35.085]  And they admit that.
[02:24:35.185 --> 02:24:37.326]  That it was under Gaddafi.
[02:24:37.386 --> 02:24:37.826]  Just like Iraq.
[02:24:37.846 --> 02:24:40.567]  They're all murdering each other in large numbers.
[02:24:40.907 --> 02:24:44.308]  They're kidnapping the Prime Minister, forcing him from office.
[02:24:44.968 --> 02:24:48.069]  Murdering the American ambassador in Benghazi.
[02:24:48.409 --> 02:24:51.510]  Killing each other, killing anyone that they can get their hands on.
[02:24:51.570 --> 02:24:54.151]  And now there's not one Libya, but three.
[02:24:54.611 --> 02:24:55.091]  Soon there'll be 33.
[02:24:55.872 --> 02:24:57.652]  What is wrong with these Al-Qaeda people?
[02:24:57.812 --> 02:24:59.953]  I mean, why are they just so insane and nasty?
[02:25:01.325 --> 02:25:13.709]  Well, Al-Qaeda's mentality is rooted in and based on the narrowest possible, most sectarian interpretation of Islam that is possible to imagine.
[02:25:14.369 --> 02:25:26.433]  And anybody who doesn't share this dogmatic, tiny, narrow interpretation of Islam is an apostate who must be killed.
[02:25:27.333 --> 02:25:29.194]  That's just other Muslims, by the way.
[02:25:29.634 --> 02:25:33.719]  Never mind when it comes to Christians or Jews or non-believers.
[02:25:34.620 --> 02:25:36.523]  All of them have to go.
[02:25:37.103 --> 02:25:44.292]  And so this narrow interpretation of Islam is supported in only one place on the Earth.
[02:25:44.493 --> 02:25:45.113]  Saudi Arabia.
[02:25:45.794 --> 02:25:47.775]  And that's Saudi Arabia, and guess what?
[02:25:48.395 --> 02:25:52.576]  Saudi Arabia is your country and my country's best friend.
[02:25:52.976 --> 02:26:01.139]  Prince Charles was there just the other week, done up like an Arab sheikh, with a sword in his hand, doing a sword dance.
[02:26:01.899 --> 02:26:05.761]  The very kind of sword that's cutting off people's heads.
[02:26:06.421 --> 02:26:08.021]  Christian clerics included.
[02:26:08.041 --> 02:26:08.762]  In Syria?
[02:26:09.822 --> 02:26:21.347]  Included in Syria having already stampeded virtually all of the Christians in Iraq out of their country and for fear of their lives.
[02:26:21.627 --> 02:26:22.088]  That's right.
[02:26:22.108 --> 02:26:25.969]  So it's one of the great puzzles of all time.
[02:26:26.570 --> 02:26:34.213]  How your country could be back in bed with Al Qaeda after everything that's happened over the last decade.
[02:26:34.393 --> 02:26:35.294]  It is incredible.
[02:26:36.514 --> 02:26:39.776]  It's so insane, George Galloway, that I can't even believe it.
[02:26:40.897 --> 02:26:42.018]  It's very hard to believe.
[02:26:42.418 --> 02:27:02.591]  But the blood and treasure of young American servicemen and women, and British servicemen and women, and your taxpayers, and mine, have been expended in the trillions of dollars, in the name of fighting Al-Qaeda, when we are now arming and funding Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[02:27:02.951 --> 02:27:04.452]  As I say, you couldn't make that up.
[02:27:05.566 --> 02:27:07.206]  In fact, I'm somewhat of a history buff.
[02:27:07.366 --> 02:27:17.689]  I can't think of really a lot of examples, or really any historically, except for 1984, and that's fiction, where you're always at war with East Asia, and the next day you're never at war with East Asia.
[02:27:18.289 --> 02:27:19.350]  It is that crazy.
[02:27:19.410 --> 02:27:25.531]  So, looking forward, because you made a lot of accurate predictions, I've read your writings, and I watch you when you're in Parliament.
[02:27:26.271 --> 02:27:28.212]  I mean, it's always informative.
[02:27:28.672 --> 02:27:31.433]  Where do you see this going, and will the political class
[02:27:32.441 --> 02:27:40.645]  Pay any price on the left and the right for the war crimes that have been committed here, and now the new war crimes of turning Al-Qaeda loose.
[02:27:40.725 --> 02:27:44.967]  I know you're working towards punishing those war crimes with a lot of courage.
[02:27:45.528 --> 02:27:46.068]  Break that down.
[02:27:47.199 --> 02:27:51.625]  Well, I'm now making a movie called The Killing of Tony Blair.
[02:27:51.705 --> 02:27:57.292]  It's not a snuff movie, it doesn't involve me killing Tony Blair, though that would probably be quite a popular movie.
[02:27:57.893 --> 02:28:04.761]  It's about the killings of Tony Blair, the killings carried out by Tony Blair, and the financial killing.
[02:28:05.382 --> 02:28:11.145]  That he is making as a result of the other killings that he had been doing.
[02:28:11.565 --> 02:28:15.847]  And so I hope that we'll get him sacked as the Middle East peace envoy.
[02:28:16.408 --> 02:28:22.811]  The most grotesque appointment since Caligula appointed his horse as a full consul of Rome.
[02:28:23.431 --> 02:28:26.834]  I hope that it will stop companies from hiring him.
[02:28:26.874 --> 02:28:43.090]  He's made more than £75m or $100m since leaving office, working for the tyrants and the companies that he so handsomely profited and benefited when he was in office.
[02:28:43.650 --> 02:28:49.554]  And I'm about to start making a movie to try and punish the American political class.
[02:28:50.014 --> 02:28:51.716]  It's called Where's Kenny Boy?
[02:28:51.736 --> 02:29:05.165]  It fastens on the criminal Kenneth Ley, who may or may not have died of a heart attack just before being sentenced for his crimes in the collapse of Enron.
[02:29:06.105 --> 02:29:14.592]  And may or may not be living on a 100,000 acre ranch owned by George Bush in Paraguay.
[02:29:15.292 --> 02:29:19.375]  Cheek by jowl with the biggest American base in the region.
[02:29:19.896 --> 02:29:26.441]  Just so people who want to look over the fence might be discouraged from doing so.
[02:29:26.601 --> 02:29:28.242]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:29:28.522 --> 02:29:30.904]  We're now crowdfunding for that movie.
[02:29:31.144 --> 02:29:32.444]  George Galloway, we gotta go to break.
[02:29:32.464 --> 02:29:34.645]  It's called, uh, it's called Where's Kenny Boy?
[02:29:34.665 --> 02:29:40.146]  And, uh, your viewers and listeners, I hope, will go to, start, join, and support it.
[02:29:40.526 --> 02:29:41.947]  Okay, George, uh, stay there.
[02:29:41.967 --> 02:29:53.210]  Uh, we're gonna come back from break, and we'll talk about the film, because I've followed this, and I'm glad you're making it, and I hope folks will support it, because clearly he staged his death two days before sentencing, and has been seen down there at the Bush Ranch.
[02:29:53.230 --> 02:29:54.870]  I mean, they're sheep-dipping, folks.
[02:29:54.910 --> 02:29:55.950]  They stage deaths all the time.
[02:29:56.211 --> 02:29:57.271]  George Galloway's our guest.
[02:29:57.291 --> 02:29:57.631]  Stay with us.
[02:29:58.820 --> 02:30:01.822]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.743 --> 02:30:05.545]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.547 --> 02:30:12.289]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[02:30:12.570 --> 02:30:17.393]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:30:17.573 --> 02:30:24.758]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[02:30:24.878 --> 02:30:30.284]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[02:30:30.524 --> 02:30:34.168]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

[02:31:18.390 --> 02:31:26.513]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:31:26.793 --> 02:31:31.495]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[02:33:26.937 --> 02:33:33.079]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:33.439 --> 02:33:34.980]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:35.720 --> 02:33:38.201]  That's right, we're liberals here like Thomas Jefferson.
[02:33:39.821 --> 02:33:44.263]  I don't accept the mainline liberal establishment or the mainline conservative establishment.
[02:33:45.583 --> 02:33:55.567]  I judge each issue on its own and geopolitically study it or domestically look at it and then try to say what is the most honorable
[02:33:56.773 --> 02:34:01.459]  balanced way to address this and to focus on it.
[02:34:02.340 --> 02:34:08.006]  Most people just choose their political ideas according to what they think is fashionable, what they think is cool.
[02:34:08.942 --> 02:34:11.965]  Most people, as you know, are not informed about the world, especially Americans.
[02:34:12.746 --> 02:34:15.268]  Either Americans are extremely informed or they're very uninformed.
[02:34:15.328 --> 02:34:21.474]  National statistics show the most uninformed in the world, other than like Afghanis, who can't even find the U.S.
[02:34:21.534 --> 02:34:22.514]  on a map in most cases.
[02:34:23.255 --> 02:34:24.236]  The equivalent of cavemen.
[02:34:24.276 --> 02:34:29.221]  I'm not knocking them, but a lot of those folks have never, you know, even really watched television in the rural areas, so you can't blame them.
[02:34:29.941 --> 02:34:31.403]  Most Americans don't have passports.
[02:34:32.003 --> 02:34:33.204]  They just think this is the earth.
[02:34:34.285 --> 02:34:41.192]  And it's very, very frustrating because clearly Russia just saw 90% of Ukraine grabbed.
[02:34:41.652 --> 02:34:43.434]  They only took an area that used to be part of Russia.
[02:34:43.714 --> 02:34:46.156]  The media spins it that they've invaded and stolen something.
[02:34:47.838 --> 02:34:53.844]  And clearly the West with the EU just gobbled the country up and overthrew an elected government and is trying to start a new Cold War.
[02:34:55.267 --> 02:34:57.209]  Now that's what Ron Paul agrees with.
[02:34:57.249 --> 02:34:58.350]  That's what George Galloway is saying.
[02:34:58.611 --> 02:35:02.054]  Not because we all get together on the phone and decide what we believe.
[02:35:02.114 --> 02:35:03.035]  We are informed.
[02:35:03.696 --> 02:35:07.080]  It's fun to be informed about the world, the regions, the players.
[02:35:07.921 --> 02:35:08.902]  That's my soap opera.
[02:35:09.462 --> 02:35:11.424]  Not football, not sitcoms, not...
[02:35:12.233 --> 02:35:15.215]  You know, when I'm home at night, I've got my friends over.
[02:35:15.255 --> 02:35:19.138]  We're sitting around, we talk about stuff like this because it's interesting to us to learn more.
[02:35:19.658 --> 02:35:20.999]  And I'm not saying I'm even that smart.
[02:35:21.379 --> 02:35:32.227]  It's very frustrating to know the facts and to know it's not your opinion, and then to just see the cheap political porn that's out there that the controlled left and controlled right spew out.
[02:35:32.247 --> 02:35:32.887]  It's very frustrating.
[02:35:33.247 --> 02:35:34.588]  We'll get George Galloway's take on that.
[02:35:36.653 --> 02:35:53.748]  Ken Lay, who clearly, the evidence is amazing, people that go down there get harassed by the way, has been sent down to South America, we're going to talk about that, another film he's working on, and where he thinks the future is going with George Galloway, and then when he leaves us, a little bit of overdrive and take your phone calls, he leaves us at 50 after.
[02:35:54.308 --> 02:35:58.492]  Briefly, remember this hour is brought to you by InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:35:59.963 --> 02:36:06.775]  With the pro-liberty t-shirts and the great political films across the political spectrum and the very best books to become informed in.
[02:36:07.864 --> 02:36:26.674]  The very best supplements, like the True Nascent Iodine, and the Fluoride Detox, and the great Wake Up America Coffee, and the Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver Double Strength, the Pro Pure Water Filtration Systems are the best gravity-fed systems out there to purify your family's water because of all the Monsanto glyphosates in the water.
[02:36:27.214 --> 02:36:32.297]  It's all available at InfoWarsTore.com, and what also makes this show possible
[02:36:33.697 --> 02:36:39.860]  Is folks like MyPatriotSupply.com with the highest quality non-GMO storable foods as we go into this global depression.
[02:36:40.381 --> 02:36:43.482]  Last 25 years it's great to just have in the attic, forget about it in the basement.
[02:36:44.683 --> 02:36:45.483]  Super high quality.
[02:36:46.144 --> 02:36:51.426]  MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex to find their specials or 866-229-0927.
[02:36:51.706 --> 02:36:53.948]  MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex.
[02:36:54.528 --> 02:37:00.151]  And it is the sponsors and this show and your support that allows us to have a wide spectrum debate
[02:37:00.991 --> 02:37:09.518]  And introduce you to all sorts of political ideas and angles and analysis that's unconventional, unorthodox, and basically renaissance-based.
[02:37:09.878 --> 02:37:11.500]  Now, George Galloway, I've been ranting here.
[02:37:11.520 --> 02:37:12.341]  I want to give you the floor.
[02:37:12.741 --> 02:37:13.782]  Tell us about the film.
[02:37:14.302 --> 02:37:15.463]  You're a serious guy.
[02:37:15.944 --> 02:37:20.968]  Basically, everything you said about Iraq came true, more than anybody, even more than Ron Paul or myself.
[02:37:21.088 --> 02:37:24.651]  What you said came true like it was, you know, prophetic.
[02:37:25.231 --> 02:37:26.613]  So, you're a serious guy.
[02:37:26.633 --> 02:37:28.996]  If you think Ken Lay is really still alive, we're investigating it.
[02:37:29.456 --> 02:37:30.057]  I think he is.
[02:37:30.077 --> 02:37:30.878]  The evidence is there.
[02:37:31.399 --> 02:37:39.609]  Tell us about your film, your crowdsourcing, and then let's move forward to the big picture, what else is happening in the world and where you see us going.
[02:37:40.506 --> 02:37:41.507]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:37:42.748 --> 02:37:44.290]  There's no evidence that he's dead.
[02:37:45.671 --> 02:38:01.748]  And all the circumstantial evidence is that he's still alive and he cheated the American justice system and allowed his family to remain in control and ownership of his millions, his estates and so on.
[02:38:02.248 --> 02:38:12.562]  By mysteriously dying of a heart attack in Colorado just three days before being sentenced for then one of the biggest frauds in corporate history.
[02:38:12.982 --> 02:38:15.726]  It prefigured the crash of 2008 and indeed
[02:38:17.688 --> 02:38:25.392]  Kenneth Lee prefigures the kind of villains that walked across the stage during the crash of 2008.
[02:38:26.653 --> 02:38:28.874]  Kenneth Lee was George W. Bush.
[02:38:29.434 --> 02:38:40.280]  He was the sponsor, primary sponsor, of the political class, not just in the Republican Party, but in the Democratic Party.
[02:38:40.700 --> 02:38:40.940]  Two.
[02:38:41.481 --> 02:38:55.476]  And when Bush flew down to Florida to fight the recount, which made him president in the first place, he flew down in an Enron jet covered in Enron insignia.
[02:38:56.156 --> 02:38:58.698]  And then, quickly, Enron collapsed.
[02:38:59.878 --> 02:39:02.119]  Billions of dollars were lost.
[02:39:02.900 --> 02:39:12.685]  He was convicted of a massive fraud three days before sentencing and thus, his family able to retain his millions.
[02:39:13.226 --> 02:39:22.211]  He was given permission to go to Colorado where he died in the night of a heart attack and then was promptly cremated.
[02:39:22.851 --> 02:39:24.672]  And nobody from the federal government
[02:39:25.032 --> 02:39:34.302]  Nobody from the FBI, nobody from the Justice Department actually saw his dead body before it was supposedly burned.
[02:39:34.783 --> 02:39:45.935]  And at his funeral, the entire American political class turned out to pay their respects to a man who had just been convicted of a gigantic
[02:39:46.716 --> 02:39:50.320]  Super fraud of billions of dollars.
[02:39:51.181 --> 02:39:56.287]  Both the Bushes were there, but President Clinton was also there.
[02:39:56.928 --> 02:39:58.890]  President Carter was also there.
[02:39:59.170 --> 02:40:01.073]  What were they even doing at the funeral?
[02:40:01.633 --> 02:40:04.434]  of a convicted criminal in this way.
[02:40:04.814 --> 02:40:06.495]  And of course he went up in smoke.
[02:40:06.935 --> 02:40:07.495]  Or did he?
[02:40:08.015 --> 02:40:20.680]  Because conveniently at the same time, a 100,000 acre ranch, now I know you're in Texas and everything's bigger in Texas, but for me, the idea that Bush owns a 100,000 acre ranch
[02:40:22.521 --> 02:40:33.994]  That he brought it right next door to the American military base, and that you risk being shot for looking over the fence to see if you can spot Kenneth Lee, is all deeply suspicious.
[02:40:34.294 --> 02:40:36.958]  So I'm going to go to Paraguay.
[02:40:37.558 --> 02:40:41.701]  I'm going to insist on looking over that face.
[02:40:41.721 --> 02:40:44.843]  That's a great movie idea that you and Max Keiser have.
[02:40:44.983 --> 02:40:58.831]  Max came up with the idea and him and I are working on it now and we're seeking crowdfunding for it on Max's crowdfunding platform which is called StartJoin and the movie's called Where's Kenny Boy?
[02:40:59.191 --> 02:41:06.196]  Because that was George W. Bush's famous cry whenever he needed anything, especially the green folding stuff,
[02:41:06.736 --> 02:41:09.078]  It was a case of, where's Kenny Boy?
[02:41:09.398 --> 02:41:11.159]  Well I'm asking, where's Kenny Boy?
[02:41:11.500 --> 02:41:18.565]  And I'm an elected British Member of Parliament, 27 years elected to the Parliament, 6 times elected.
[02:41:19.005 --> 02:41:24.169]  Let's see if they shoot me walking up the drive of the 100,000 acre ranch.
[02:41:24.929 --> 02:41:28.192]  Kenneth Lee, if you're out there, I'm coming to get you.
[02:41:29.500 --> 02:41:37.097]  Well, when you look at everything you just said, it's all on record, and they routinely stage military personnel's death to give them new personalities.
[02:41:37.899 --> 02:41:38.961]  We've studied Enron.
[02:41:39.141 --> 02:41:39.903]  It was a giant...
[02:41:41.011 --> 02:41:47.437]  multi hundred billion dollar front that they were putting money in the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas, Switzerland.
[02:41:47.878 --> 02:41:55.965]  They would on a single week make a billion dollars extra lying and claiming there was no electricity and triple and quadruple charging people.
[02:41:57.146 --> 02:42:03.232]  Power bills would go from a thousand dollars to six thousand dollars in a month in California and surrounding states.
[02:42:03.512 --> 02:42:05.133]  He was a master criminal
[02:42:06.074 --> 02:42:14.842]  And the fact is, is that they were protecting him, and undoubtedly, it's been reported he keeps getting seen down there, and only uses that as a home base.
[02:42:16.324 --> 02:42:22.149]  And you going down there, because you've got the courage to do it, will become a sensational film regardless.
[02:42:22.169 --> 02:42:23.030]  They've got to be concerned.
[02:42:23.649 --> 02:42:24.169]  I hope so.
[02:42:24.670 --> 02:42:46.441]  And just to add to the masterful summary you just gave there of Leigh's role in things and Enron's role in things, he took care to spread money around the political class to make sure that he would not have any difficulties on either side of the aisle, whoever was in control of the American political system.
[02:42:46.841 --> 02:42:50.103]  And that's the very corporate takeover of politics.
[02:42:50.843 --> 02:42:57.206]  On both sides of the Atlantic, we've been suffering from so grievously in the last decades.
[02:42:57.866 --> 02:43:01.888]  Well that's right, because when they take the money they then also get basically corrupted into it.
[02:43:01.908 --> 02:43:05.189]  And that's right, he came up with the carbon tax plan with Al Gore.
[02:43:05.510 --> 02:43:08.491]  You can say what you want about climate change or this and that, but clearly
[02:43:09.551 --> 02:43:14.213]  Paying the political class carbon money is what has basically tainted the whole thing.
[02:43:14.253 --> 02:43:17.715]  And Ken Lay came up with smart meters to gouge people.
[02:43:17.735 --> 02:43:22.277]  I mean, so many things that we now see today were the brainchild of Ken Lay.
[02:43:22.597 --> 02:43:23.358]  Why do you think he had...
[02:43:24.690 --> 02:43:29.913]  He was a very bad man, but we're not just going after him because he was a very bad man.
[02:43:30.233 --> 02:43:44.021]  It's because he exemplifies, personifies, literally personifies, this corrupt political corporate class that has ruined the lives of so many tens of millions on both sides of the Atlantic.
[02:43:44.541 --> 02:43:47.683]  And by telling his story, by going looking for him,
[02:43:48.323 --> 02:43:59.007]  We're also going looking for the corrupt politicians that he bought and paid for and who undoubtedly protected him and may even have faked his death.
[02:43:59.327 --> 02:44:00.068]  Of course they did.
[02:44:00.328 --> 02:44:02.969]  Let's shift gears over into
[02:44:03.789 --> 02:44:05.691]  If you're going to steal a million, why not steal a trillion?
[02:44:05.711 --> 02:44:11.476]  If you're going to lie a little and launch a whole war that kills a million people, according to Lancet, why not stage the death of one guy?
[02:44:11.496 --> 02:44:12.016]  Of course they did.
[02:44:12.316 --> 02:44:13.257]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[02:44:13.938 --> 02:44:19.703]  But let's get back into the other film you guys are crowdsourcing, and Kaiser better make these, because I know he's got the money to make them anyways.
[02:44:19.743 --> 02:44:23.125]  The point is, people should support it, because I want to see these films, especially with you in them.
[02:44:24.146 --> 02:44:26.869]  What about Tony Blair?
[02:44:26.889 --> 02:44:27.709]  I mean, he clearly
[02:44:28.630 --> 02:44:31.791]  With the Downing Street memo, the White House memo, well, you're the expert on it.
[02:44:32.191 --> 02:44:41.355]  I mean, we've got the evidence he's a war criminal, and if we can punish one of these criminals, even in the court of public opinion, it will stop them doing it next time.
[02:44:42.096 --> 02:44:47.538]  Well, Alex, in the court of public opinion, Tony Blair is already tried and convicted.
[02:44:48.058 --> 02:44:51.460]  He's like that character in the movie Ghostwriter.
[02:44:51.900 --> 02:44:57.482]  He spends most of his time out of Britain because he can't walk down any street in Britain.
[02:44:57.942 --> 02:45:04.005]  Every time he sits down in a restaurant, somebody tries to perform a citizen's arrest upon him.
[02:45:04.645 --> 02:45:09.667]  And his gow-lighters and his lieutenants, who suffer similar fates,
[02:45:10.407 --> 02:45:26.280]  And so in public opinion, this man is destroyed in Britain because it's seen that he lied us into a war in which a million people perished and which cascaded this extremism around the world that we've been talking about.
[02:45:26.721 --> 02:45:30.584]  But companies keep hiring him, banks in particular,
[02:45:31.024 --> 02:45:36.028]  But oil companies and other corporate interests to a fantastic tune.
[02:45:36.608 --> 02:45:50.458]  It's never been known in British politics before for a former Prime Minister to do other than retire to a country estate, sedately advise us from time to time on international politics.
[02:45:50.558 --> 02:45:51.759]  It's a delayed payoff.
[02:45:52.520 --> 02:45:55.402]  Yeah, but now we've got a situation
[02:45:55.979 --> 02:46:08.449]  Where the new class of politicians are being told, if you play ball with the right interests, they'll look after you after your term of office is over.
[02:46:08.990 --> 02:46:12.593]  And that is just fatal for the political system.
[02:46:12.933 --> 02:46:15.095]  Because if you're legislating,
[02:46:17.936 --> 02:46:29.724]  Sure, so how does it all end?
[02:46:29.784 --> 02:46:30.564]  How does it all end?
[02:46:30.584 --> 02:46:36.988]  Because it's clearly, the fruit is rotting now, they're getting away with everything, and historically that causes megalomania.
[02:46:37.048 --> 02:46:37.609]  How does it end?
[02:46:37.629 --> 02:46:39.970]  I mean, you predicted how all the other stuff would go the last decade.
[02:46:40.290 --> 02:46:41.071]  What's going to happen now?
[02:46:41.351 --> 02:46:48.075]  I think it'll end okay, Alex, and that's where maybe you and I would part company at this point in this sense.
[02:46:48.635 --> 02:47:00.062]  Because I believe that the fruit is rotting, it's falling off the trees, in the sense that people have absolutely no faith in the political class which governs them.
[02:47:00.262 --> 02:47:00.903]  And they're right.
[02:47:01.503 --> 02:47:02.684]  Not to do so.
[02:47:02.885 --> 02:47:03.666]  Oh no, I agree with you.
[02:47:03.766 --> 02:47:04.326]  I agree with you.
[02:47:04.346 --> 02:47:09.011]  That does not yet have a form, a physical form of an alternative power.
[02:47:09.372 --> 02:47:11.374]  At least not in your country or mine.
[02:47:11.754 --> 02:47:16.480]  In many other parts of Europe, for example, an anti-political class
[02:47:17.120 --> 02:47:25.165]  is beginning to germinate, to continue your metaphor, and is bearing new fruit.
[02:47:25.245 --> 02:47:27.606]  Some of it I like, some of it I don't like.
[02:47:27.706 --> 02:47:35.730]  But it's all new power coming through because people have entirely lost faith in the old ways.
[02:47:36.351 --> 02:47:40.933]  And the old ways are no longer able to govern as they were.
[02:47:41.373 --> 02:47:43.735]  Otherwise, we'd now be at war with Syria.
[02:47:44.515 --> 02:47:46.076]  No George, I agree with you.
[02:48:09.113 --> 02:48:14.438]  And Iran would be a belligerent and goodness knows where that would have all ended up.
[02:48:14.778 --> 02:48:19.142]  We stopped that because the political class is now terrified of the public.
[02:48:19.642 --> 02:48:27.009]  In Britain, the politicians know that the public hate them, regard them as thieves who fill their own pockets.
[02:48:27.529 --> 02:48:27.769]  Oh, I agree.
[02:48:27.809 --> 02:48:28.610]  Well, let me add this.
[02:48:28.630 --> 02:48:30.251]  Let me add this, George.
[02:48:30.271 --> 02:48:33.693]  When I was in the UK last year to cover and protest Bilderberg,
[02:48:52.983 --> 02:49:00.687]  Almost all the police, you name it, were telling us, hey we're on your side, we hate the people in there, we know this is going on, we know there's a shadow government.
[02:49:01.428 --> 02:49:09.192]  And it was across the political spectrum, people were really angry in England, you know, they're north of London and Wadford, they're in the UK.
[02:49:09.552 --> 02:49:16.556]  So no, we don't disagree, there's a huge awakening, but the political class is militarizing and racing to authoritarianism.
[02:49:17.296 --> 02:49:26.014]  And having the NSA and, you know, your NSA spy on Parliament, spy on the Senate, to the point of... I mean, the battle's being joined is what I'm saying.
[02:49:26.616 --> 02:49:27.937]  No, well I agree with that.
[02:49:29.097 --> 02:49:35.440]  I'm just, I think, a little more confident than you, perhaps I'm not, forgive me if I'm wrong, that we will prevail.
[02:49:35.460 --> 02:49:39.122]  I don't believe we will go to authoritarianism.
[02:49:39.222 --> 02:49:43.484]  Fascism is not possible in the United States or the United Kingdom.
[02:49:43.544 --> 02:49:45.705]  I don't think the people would tolerate it.
[02:49:45.805 --> 02:49:47.826]  But that's not a fruit that falls off the tree.
[02:49:48.146 --> 02:49:53.591]  You have to shake the tree to make sure that people avoid that perilous fate.
[02:49:54.231 --> 02:49:56.013]  On that, definitely, we would agree.
[02:49:57.033 --> 02:50:01.877]  All that's required for the triumph of evil is that good men and women do nothing.
[02:50:02.117 --> 02:50:02.378]  That's right.
[02:50:02.398 --> 02:50:10.845]  And we've got to make sure, and you're busy on that, so am I, we've got to make sure that the people do what's necessary to do to stop that fate.
[02:50:11.425 --> 02:50:15.269]  Well, I want to get you back as soon as you go down there to try to cover his ranch and give us coverage.
[02:50:15.789 --> 02:50:23.476]  And GeorgeGalloway.com, RespectParty.org, I really appreciate you spending time with us, and you've really went up against a lot.
[02:50:23.496 --> 02:50:25.979]  They tried to destroy you when you exposed the Iraq War.
[02:50:26.319 --> 02:50:29.362]  We all admire courage, so thank you so much for your time, George Galloway.
[02:50:29.793 --> 02:50:30.253]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:50:30.293 --> 02:50:30.994]  It's been a pleasure.
[02:50:46.465 --> 02:50:48.806]  And we appreciate him coming on the show, and I hope those movies get made.
[02:50:48.826 --> 02:50:51.947]  Alright, I'm going to come back, take phone calls in the next segment, the one after that.
[02:50:51.967 --> 02:50:57.548]  I'm going to talk to Scott and Rod and Ed and Patrick and JD and others.
[02:50:57.588 --> 02:50:59.669]  Get ready with your comments straight ahead.

[02:51:06.771 --> 02:51:08.572]  But everything Galloway said, you can prove.
[02:51:09.542 --> 02:51:11.143]  A healthy heart is a happy heart.
[02:51:11.343 --> 02:51:13.204]  And a healthy heart means a happy body.
[02:51:13.264 --> 02:51:24.549]  Friend, if you're suffering from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, clogged arteries, or arthritis, you've got to try heart and body extract.

[02:51:40.456 --> 02:51:44.778]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?

[02:53:55.178 --> 02:53:55.979]  Immediately.
[02:53:56.039 --> 02:54:00.461]  Before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.
[02:54:00.821 --> 02:54:10.626]  MyPatriotSupply.com MyPatriotSupply.com I got one more silver dollar.
[02:54:37.040 --> 02:54:46.026]  Look at this.
[02:54:46.046 --> 02:54:48.928]  The Economist says paramilitary police cops are soldiers.
[02:54:49.488 --> 02:54:51.249]  America's police have become too militarized.
[02:54:51.770 --> 02:54:59.255]  Suddenly I'm seeing Wall Street Journal, New York Times, The Economist, all saying we have dangerous paramilitary armies being built in the U.S.
[02:55:00.472 --> 02:55:12.139]  Well, the issue is I'm not even worried if they had militarized trained units of police to deal with, you know, the heavily armed threats sometimes, because I want us to be able to have guns, so sometimes it's going to be bad guys that are heavily armed.
[02:55:12.779 --> 02:55:16.702]  My issue is that they're trained with the citizens, where you don't instantly do what they say.
[02:55:16.742 --> 02:55:18.243]  They start tasering you or attack you.
[02:55:18.543 --> 02:55:21.305]  That's all military-type checkpoint training.
[02:55:22.645 --> 02:55:28.169]  And, you know, the TSA training and the checkpoint training, that's all militarization martial law stuff.
[02:55:29.193 --> 02:55:34.357]  It's the martial law that's bad, not the cops, you know, in SWAT team outfits.
[02:55:35.758 --> 02:55:44.445]  The problem is, is that now all the units want to be in SWAT teams and now they come to a regular, you know, visit because they heard about a domestic dispute, so they come with a SWAT team.
[02:55:44.805 --> 02:55:47.587]  That is the militarization, that is the problem, the overuse of it.
[02:55:48.448 --> 02:55:56.014]  And now the establishment's talking about it, which just means it's become so ubiquitous that people are getting scared of it.
[02:55:57.558 --> 02:56:02.284]  Folks, the military is routinely in plain clothes with the SWAT teams, just so everybody knows, since the late 80s.
[02:56:02.845 --> 02:56:08.852]  We've got all the documents on that in my film, The Road to Tyranny, which really is a seminal documentary.
[02:56:10.473 --> 02:56:13.617]  Let's go right now to Scott in Washington.
[02:56:13.637 --> 02:56:14.378]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:56:14.398 --> 02:56:14.899]  Thanks for holding.
[02:56:16.039 --> 02:56:22.880]  Oh yes, Alex, I'm so glad you brought up that piece with Al Sharpton and the race hustling and all that.
[02:56:22.960 --> 02:56:28.022]  Let me give you the irony of Mr. Reverend Matt Daddy Pimp Sharpton.
[02:56:28.742 --> 02:56:39.144]  Now, go back to 1964, and I know you had Reverend Steve Bryant on, and you mentioned this in passing about Robert Byrd being a part of the KKK.
[02:56:40.223 --> 02:57:07.950]  And, you know, this is the guy that filibustered the 1964 Act, but there's a little fact to it that most people either don't know or have forgotten about, is the fact that not only did he filibuster it, but what he used to filibuster it was some scientific study from a guy by the name of Boas, stating that the black brain was inferior to the white brain because it didn't weigh as much, so it wasn't because he ejected on some kind of a
[02:57:09.229 --> 02:57:15.254]  And that was all a eugenics thing, like scamming weights from the people they chose to do the test.
[02:57:15.874 --> 02:57:16.995]  So none of it even means anything.
[02:57:17.055 --> 02:57:23.620]  No, I mean, obviously, Al Sharpton got mad, and so did the rest of MSNBC about that unifying speech Rand Paul gave.
[02:57:24.681 --> 02:57:27.043]  So he basically did you know what in the punch bowl.
[02:57:27.063 --> 02:57:28.164]  I mean, that's all he's doing.
[02:57:28.184 --> 02:57:34.889]  46 years later, when that piece of experiment died, you've got him sitting up there
[02:57:35.413 --> 02:57:44.223]  One of the people eulogizing that history was talking about, oh yeah, well he was a part of it and stuff, but the guy changed, which was a concern because he never actually did.
[02:57:44.944 --> 02:57:53.153]  But he's sitting up here talking about what Rand Paul might have done in 1963 when he was all, maybe a year old when that thing passed.
[02:57:53.740 --> 02:57:55.441]  Well, you know, that's one of the ironies.
[02:57:55.861 --> 02:57:56.381]  Exactly.
[02:57:56.421 --> 02:58:01.263]  They've taken the Civil Rights Act and used parts of it to make Christians pay for abortions.
[02:58:01.323 --> 02:58:02.544]  I mean, churches shouldn't have to do that.
[02:58:03.064 --> 02:58:11.587]  And you should be able to, you know, not rent to somebody if they're a devil worshiper and you're a Christian, or vice versa, if you're an atheist.
[02:58:12.227 --> 02:58:15.729]  And, you know, the whole issue is there's problems, there's evils on both sides.
[02:58:16.089 --> 02:58:18.030]  Rand Paul is just trying to be honest and saying, look,
[02:58:18.888 --> 02:58:20.849]  You know, uh, should he be able to have private clubs?
[02:58:21.309 --> 02:58:23.590]  Should he be able to have stuff, you know, private golf course?
[02:58:24.071 --> 02:58:26.672]  Where, you know, say black folks say we don't, this or that.
[02:58:26.972 --> 02:58:31.434]  Just because it's racist or whatever it is, or white folks do it, that's somewhat of the freedom.
[02:58:31.835 --> 02:58:32.895]  And we can debate that.
[02:58:33.295 --> 02:58:36.177]  The point is, is that Rand Paul is not a racist.
[02:58:36.657 --> 02:58:39.779]  Rand Paul's trying to unify people, and that's why they don't like him.
[02:58:40.419 --> 02:58:42.321]  Because we're all getting spied on by the NSA.
[02:58:42.561 --> 02:58:44.422]  We're all getting foreign banks looting our bank accounts.
[02:58:44.763 --> 02:58:45.623]  Thank you so much for the call.
[02:58:45.643 --> 02:58:46.784]  We're going to come back in overdrive.
[02:58:47.125 --> 02:58:47.905]  Infowars.com.
[02:58:47.925 --> 02:58:49.307]  Porch slash show if your station doesn't carry it.
[02:58:49.667 --> 02:58:51.008]  Audio and video feeds are right there.
[02:58:51.388 --> 02:58:51.889]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:58:51.969 --> 02:58:54.531]  I'm going to cram in as many calls as I can.
[02:58:54.871 --> 02:58:55.732]  Start your engines.
[02:58:55.792 --> 02:58:56.392]  Back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:59.358 --> 02:59:00.199]  The facts are in.
[02:59:00.379 --> 02:59:01.499]  The studies are legion.
[02:59:01.780 --> 02:59:09.144]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[02:59:09.304 --> 02:59:12.746]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[02:59:13.126 --> 02:59:13.507]  Simple.
[02:59:13.707 --> 02:59:18.129]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[02:59:18.430 --> 02:59:23.853]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[02:59:24.133 --> 02:59:29.517]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
[02:59:29.657 --> 02:59:40.124]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[02:59:40.444 --> 02:59:44.708]  Let's take a stand against the Globalists by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[02:59:45.028 --> 02:59:46.869]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[02:59:47.190 --> 02:59:52.494]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[02:59:52.754 --> 02:59:56.998]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[02:59:57.158 --> 02:59:59.039]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:00:00.280 --> 03:00:01.461]  Coast to Coast.
[03:00:01.822 --> 03:00:03.223]  Direct from Austin.
[03:00:03.883 --> 03:00:07.086]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:14.246 --> 03:00:14.906]  Big Brother.
[03:00:15.566 --> 03:00:16.587]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:17.327 --> 03:00:18.427]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:19.108 --> 03:00:19.888]  You want answers?
[03:00:20.668 --> 03:00:21.568]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:22.209 --> 03:00:25.830]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:26.410 --> 03:00:30.511]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:31.671 --> 03:00:33.132]  Alright, we're in overdrive.
[03:00:33.172 --> 03:00:34.992]  Let's go to Patrick in Oklahoma.
[03:00:35.012 --> 03:00:35.613]  You're on the air.
[03:00:35.693 --> 03:00:36.373]  Thanks for calling.
[03:00:38.522 --> 03:00:39.243]  Yeah, I'm Patrick.
[03:00:39.323 --> 03:00:45.052]  I'm a pastor in Oklahoma and I just wanted to give you kind of my view on your show.
[03:00:45.072 --> 03:00:46.555]  I've been listening for a number of years.
[03:00:46.983 --> 03:00:51.646]  I really enjoy, particularly the news that you'll hear from your show you can't hear anywhere else.
[03:00:52.166 --> 03:00:59.030]  But I've been noticing more and more over the last few years, Alex, that your show has a lot more to do with spiritual things.
[03:00:59.050 --> 03:01:03.433]  So you talk about, you know, evil and, you know, what Satan is doing on Earth and everything.
[03:01:03.993 --> 03:01:14.299]  And I understand, and I agree with a lot of the things you have to say about that, but I did just want to bring up to you and make aware to you something about that in particular, that when you are
[03:01:14.799 --> 03:01:23.186]  You know, searching and looking in the face of evil day-to-day, it really can have an effect on you.
[03:01:23.686 --> 03:01:33.074]  And, you know, the Word says, for instance, that we are to be wise concerning what is good and simple concerning what is evil.
[03:01:33.743 --> 03:01:36.264]  And so, of course, I mean, it also, you know, you probably know this.
[03:01:36.344 --> 03:01:42.486]  Well, undoubtedly, I know when you start getting into preacher territory, the preachers will start judging you for what you do or what you say.
[03:01:42.866 --> 03:01:47.468]  And I'm the first person to tell you, you know, that I come off, you know, more like a drill sergeant than a preacher.
[03:01:47.488 --> 03:01:50.229]  And I'm not saying I'm a preacher, and I am desperately wicked.
[03:01:50.749 --> 03:01:52.210]  So I'm not judging anybody here.
[03:01:52.890 --> 03:01:53.830]  I mean, I just, you know what it is?
[03:01:53.870 --> 03:01:55.911]  I'm getting more and more real with people on air.
[03:01:56.451 --> 03:02:01.073]  What you get on air now, in the 19 years I've been on air, is exactly what I'm like.
[03:02:01.863 --> 03:02:03.943]  I was never fake, but I'd hold back and stuff.
[03:02:04.523 --> 03:02:07.384]  Man, I just say what I'm thinking, and I am who I am.
[03:02:07.424 --> 03:02:11.065]  You are getting what I'm like if we were out on the dock fishing.
[03:02:11.405 --> 03:02:12.725]  I mean, this is who I am.
[03:02:12.765 --> 03:02:13.205]  This is it.
[03:02:14.885 --> 03:02:15.625]  And I understand.
[03:02:16.286 --> 03:02:24.987]  The only thing that I wanted to mention to you is just this, that there is a danger in only searching and looking for what is evil in this world.
[03:02:25.087 --> 03:02:26.987]  It actually absolutely has an effect on you.
[03:02:27.027 --> 03:02:28.188]  I've seen it happen in too many times.
[03:02:28.208 --> 03:02:29.848]  Oh my gosh, I was thinking that this morning.
[03:02:30.228 --> 03:02:38.832]  That the big point I wanted to have as a talking point was, look at the good in the world, because if we only cover the bad in the world, then it almost becomes a disease.
[03:02:38.892 --> 03:02:41.994]  But I'm exposing the evil, so that we can protect the good.
[03:02:42.014 --> 03:02:47.277]  But I get what you're saying, and I've told my reporters, let's cover good stuff cops do, and good things politicians do.
[03:02:47.337 --> 03:02:51.119]  And I was doing that earlier in the show, you know, about movies with good messages versus bad.
[03:02:52.339 --> 03:02:53.660]  I did, and I agreed with you there.
[03:02:53.680 --> 03:02:59.243]  The only thing I want to get at is that when it comes to you exposing spiritual wickedness,
[03:02:59.756 --> 03:03:05.379]  I also maybe suggest that, hey, perhaps we also make it aware about spiritual good things.
[03:03:05.399 --> 03:03:08.100]  I don't know if that would ever be something you could talk about on your show or not.
[03:03:08.580 --> 03:03:11.742]  Well, I do talk about the good stuff, but listen, God bless you and I appreciate your call.
[03:03:12.322 --> 03:03:16.344]  Man, you know, one good thing about the broadcast is it's totally real and sea of the pants.
[03:03:16.764 --> 03:03:18.085]  That's also a bad thing about it.
[03:03:18.645 --> 03:03:22.147]  Because, I mean, I'll have my earpiece go in my ear and say, give me pliers on air, not even thinking.
[03:03:22.167 --> 03:03:23.108]  I just want the thing out of my ear.
[03:03:23.408 --> 03:03:25.569]  Should have just got off the air, gone in and got pliers, got them out.
[03:03:26.667 --> 03:03:29.711]  I mean, it looked ridiculous what I did that day, but it just was spur of the moment.
[03:03:29.751 --> 03:03:32.074]  It was like sliding into my ear and I just did it.
[03:03:32.114 --> 03:03:33.175]  I mean, I'm real, folks.
[03:03:34.116 --> 03:03:37.080]  I don't have time or energy to put on an act, is all I'm trying to say.
[03:03:37.100 --> 03:03:38.321]  So you got to put up with me.
[03:03:39.122 --> 03:03:40.223]  Let's talk to Ed in Florida.
[03:03:40.243 --> 03:03:40.724]  You're on the air.
[03:03:40.744 --> 03:03:41.125]  Go ahead.
[03:03:41.145 --> 03:03:43.287]  Hey, how you doing Alex?
[03:03:43.407 --> 03:03:43.788]  Good, brother.
[03:03:44.969 --> 03:03:48.590]  Hey, I was calling with regard to the President's visit to Orlando, Florida yesterday.
[03:03:48.610 --> 03:03:49.871]  He came to Valencia College.
[03:03:49.971 --> 03:03:53.572]  It was a private meeting, so I'm assuming he went there to promote the Affordable Health Care Act.
[03:03:53.772 --> 03:03:59.715]  But one thing we've been noticing in Toronto, every time he comes to Orlando, is that the chemtrails stop the day before and the day after.
[03:04:00.993 --> 03:04:02.834]  So, it's almost like, you know, we have perfect weather.
[03:04:03.015 --> 03:04:03.915]  That's what I told my wife.
[03:04:03.935 --> 03:04:07.838]  Well, there is a geoengineering program going on and it's declassified, the details aren't.
[03:04:07.878 --> 03:04:12.702]  It's aluminum dioxide, barium salt, the soil's building up with it and they just play God.
[03:04:12.722 --> 03:04:15.704]  They put stuff in our water, they put stuff in our food, it's all funny to them.
[03:04:17.014 --> 03:04:17.955]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[03:04:18.195 --> 03:04:19.976]  Have you seen that trend elsewhere in the country?
[03:04:20.016 --> 03:04:23.057]  Like, for Washington, D.C., for example, do they not chemtrail there?
[03:04:23.097 --> 03:04:26.479]  Because a lot of the people who are involved in this are staying in that area for most of the time.
[03:04:26.499 --> 03:04:31.281]  Yeah, I don't know if it's what they call circumstantial evidence, but I have heard about that trend, yes.
[03:04:32.682 --> 03:04:33.062]  Interesting.
[03:04:33.222 --> 03:04:34.843]  Okay, well, carry on the good work.
[03:04:34.863 --> 03:04:35.884]  I appreciate your time.
[03:04:35.904 --> 03:04:36.684]  Let me talk to you.
[03:04:36.704 --> 03:04:37.044]  Sure, sure.
[03:04:37.084 --> 03:04:38.705]  But when they're spraying stuff at 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 feet,
[03:04:41.604 --> 03:04:44.885]  That's creating persistent contrails to manipulate the weather and other things.
[03:04:45.846 --> 03:04:48.367]  That stuff's coming down thousands of miles away in the jet stream.
[03:04:48.407 --> 03:04:51.048]  So, it's not like they don't spray up there that day because Obama's there.
[03:04:52.568 --> 03:04:53.729]  Um, so I don't know.
[03:04:53.789 --> 03:04:55.609]  Man, all I know is there's a bunch of secret stuff going on.
[03:04:55.629 --> 03:04:56.510]  I'm sorry to the other callers.
[03:04:57.050 --> 03:04:57.770]  I've tried my best.
[03:04:57.790 --> 03:04:58.470]  We're out of time.
[03:04:58.571 --> 03:04:59.511]  Great job to the crew.
[03:04:59.811 --> 03:05:02.192]  Nightly News, back tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[03:05:02.452 --> 03:05:07.274]  PrisonPlanet.tv, and I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., with a live Sunday Transmission.
[03:05:10.871 --> 03:05:12.093]  The number one secret, Tev.
[03:05:12.394 --> 03:05:13.195]  These are legion.
[03:05:13.435 --> 03:05:14.497]  Sodium fluoride.
