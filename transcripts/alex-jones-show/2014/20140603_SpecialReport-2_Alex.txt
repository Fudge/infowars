[00:00:19.584 --> 00:00:25.147]  According to a 2008 Pentagon dossier on Guantanamo Bay inmates, it was disclosed by WikiLeaks,
[00:00:25.547 --> 00:00:30.434]  All five men released were considered to be a high risk to launch attacks against the U.S.
[00:00:30.534 --> 00:00:32.897]  and its allies if they were liberated.
[00:00:33.197 --> 00:00:43.451]  Mullah Mohammad Fazl is Taliban's former Deputy Defense Minister and is wanted by the United Nations for his role in massacres targeting Afghan's Shiite Muslim population.
[00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:51.559]  Mullah Nawrullah Nouri was a senior Taliban military figure directly subordinate to Taliban Supreme Leader Mullah Omar.

[00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.793]  Abdul Haq Wasiq is a former Deputy Minister of Intelligence.
[00:01:05.293 --> 00:01:07.514]  At one point, he tried to cooperate with U.S.
[00:01:07.554 --> 00:01:13.877]  forces in Afghanistan, asking for a GPS system as well as a special radio to communicate with the U.S.
[00:01:13.937 --> 00:01:16.518]  military after the invasion in 2001.

[00:01:25.822 --> 00:01:30.585]  Mohammed Nabi Omari held several military leadership posts for the Taliban.
[00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:35.529]  He helped organize the Al-Qaeda and Taliban militias that fought against U.S.
[00:01:35.589 --> 00:01:37.870]  and coalition troops in the first year of the war.

[00:01:44.455 --> 00:01:47.857]  Nabi maintains strong ties to active networks.
[00:01:48.237 --> 00:01:49.058]  We're good to go.

[00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:12.842]  The dossier says the detainee claimed to be a longtime friend of Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai.
[00:02:13.122 --> 00:02:19.106]  According to Afghanistananalysts.org, Karikwa is the most senior of the five on the list.
[00:02:19.626 --> 00:02:24.529]  He is one of the fraternity of original Taliban who launched the movement in 1994.
[00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.434]  In other words, he is someone who will still command a great deal of influence and respect among today's insurgents.

[00:02:46.307 --> 00:02:49.250]  At the time, Dianne Feinstein opposed the swap, saying,
[00:02:53.454 --> 00:02:53.814]  We're good to go.
[00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.897]  The United States just announced it's winding down the war in Afghanistan to concentrate on emerging terrorist threats elsewhere.
[00:03:22.278 --> 00:03:29.285]  The sudden release of these Taliban commanders now will end up replenishing the diminished leadership ranks of the Afghan Taliban.
