[00:00:19.505 --> 00:00:21.347]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.387 --> 00:00:25.671]  It is Tuesday, February 11th, 2014, and I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:26.832]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:29.574 --> 00:00:35.280]  Tonight, the Defense Department destroys bin Laden death photos hours after a FOIA request.
[00:00:36.223 --> 00:00:37.744]  Then, Washington D.C.
[00:00:37.784 --> 00:00:41.788]  man SWAT teamed and charged over a spent shotgun shell.
[00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:50.076]  And, Thomas Jefferson must be spinning in his grave after Obama visits his home and says, He's got to be the king.
[00:00:58.473 --> 00:01:01.234]  Well, the war against gun owners is on.
[00:01:01.634 --> 00:01:06.657]  If you are an American who likes to exercise your Second Amendment right, well, congratulations!
[00:01:07.017 --> 00:01:08.718]  You are a terrorist.
[00:01:09.018 --> 00:01:11.699]  That's right, it's no longer Al-Qaeda that they're worried about.
[00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:19.303]  It's law-abiding Americans who are being accused of being the next domestic terrorist cells to pop off.
[00:01:20.263 --> 00:01:29.109]  The powers that be are so concerned that their little Orwellian takeover is going to fail because of gun-toting Americans.
[00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.613]  That's why they are brainwashing the police to turn against the very citizens that they're meant to protect.
[00:01:35.974 --> 00:01:42.338]  They're saying, you will be attacked by a patriot, so here, have this tank to patrol your city.
[00:01:42.798 --> 00:01:49.483]  Or, you will be attacked by a gun owner, so here, use this weaponized drone or these robots.
[00:01:50.323 --> 00:01:54.185]  To go ahead and just police your tiny little neighborhood.
[00:01:54.225 --> 00:02:05.330]  That's why we saw the Ohio National Guard using Second Amendment supporters and anti-government teachers in their little domestic terrorist drill scenario.
[00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.191]  It's because they're scared of us.
[00:02:07.931 --> 00:02:10.292]  The powers that be are so scared of gun
[00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:12.954]  Toting Americans.
[00:02:13.054 --> 00:02:15.757]  We are the checkmate in their New World Order plan.
[00:02:16.157 --> 00:02:17.598]  The enemy is the free thinker.
[00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:21.402]  And they know that because we can take down the New World Order.
[00:02:21.602 --> 00:02:23.704]  And that's why they are so afraid of us.
[00:02:23.764 --> 00:02:26.326]  They must disarm the nation.
[00:02:26.707 --> 00:02:30.290]  We've been telling you about this for years now, but it is on.
[00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.051]  They are really ramping up these efforts.
[00:02:32.432 --> 00:02:36.556]  Here we have a DC businessman who is now facing two years of jail time
[00:02:37.096 --> 00:02:40.499]  Because he had a shell casing in his home.
[00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:42.380]  The police in D.C.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:53.109]  raided his house looking for firearms and ammunition, gun cleaning equipment, holsters, bullet holders, and ammunition receipts, as if those were against the law.
[00:02:53.529 --> 00:03:01.176]  The police found no guns in the house, but they did write on the warrant that the items discovered one was a single live round of ammo.
[00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:11.281]  Which in actuality was one inoperable shotgun shell that misfired during a hunt years earlier that Mr. Wittachek had said he kept as a souvenir.
[00:03:11.701 --> 00:03:16.564]  And they also said they found a handgun holster, which is perfectly legal.
[00:03:16.984 --> 00:03:23.147]  Now all of this came about because his disgruntled ex-wife told police that there were guns in the home.
[00:03:23.647 --> 00:03:34.110]  So, of course, you know, the police have to come in full force because they want to show support whenever, you know, the neighborhood snitches see something, say something.
[00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.152]  So they got to go in full force and say, oh, good job, you little angry, snitchy citizen.
[00:03:39.632 --> 00:03:41.613]  So this man, he has no criminal record.
[00:03:41.693 --> 00:03:44.534]  He's never had a firearm within the city limits.
[00:03:45.034 --> 00:03:48.875]  But he's being prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
[00:03:49.315 --> 00:03:51.276]  Now he said he's not going to take that lying down.
[00:03:51.376 --> 00:03:52.216]  It's the principle.
[00:03:52.596 --> 00:03:58.237]  So he is going to risk prison time by going to trial instead of pleading guilty.
[00:03:58.737 --> 00:03:59.758]  So you're darn right.
[00:03:59.818 --> 00:04:01.018]  And that's what we have to do.
[00:04:01.078 --> 00:04:08.400]  And I hope that his jury understands jury nullification and throws that bad law out and says, you know what?
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.620]  The law of the land says there's a second amendment.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.101]  And so this guy, he didn't do anything wrong.
[00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:16.583]  That's the power you have when you're in a jury.
[00:04:16.643 --> 00:04:17.604]  Jury nullification.
[00:04:18.064 --> 00:04:18.764]  Look it up.
[00:04:19.005 --> 00:04:19.965]  Tell all your friends.
[00:04:20.406 --> 00:04:21.426]  But he's not the only one.
[00:04:21.807 --> 00:04:25.570]  Another Florida man is also opting out of pleading guilty.
[00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.614]  He was pulled over while he was driving through Maryland when the police officer
[00:04:31.374 --> 00:04:35.075]  It was an unmarked patrol car and they were bird dogging him for about 10 minutes.
[00:04:35.615 --> 00:04:40.217]  Finally they pull him over and they say, you have a concealed carry license.
[00:04:40.577 --> 00:04:42.978]  And the guy's like, how did you know that?
[00:04:43.258 --> 00:04:48.419]  So apparently they're running people's plates and they know that you have a concealed carry license.
[00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:56.662]  So the police there, it was the Transportation Authority Police, they refused to tell the man how they knew that he had a concealed carry license.
[00:04:57.162 --> 00:05:10.665]  But they proceeded to harass him and his family and search his car for two hours, demanding that the man turn over his firearm, which the man said, I left it in my safe at home in Florida.
[00:05:11.165 --> 00:05:18.887]  I mean, he knew that he was taking a road trip through a hostile territory, so he left his gun at home, even though he was going on this long road trip.
[00:05:19.267 --> 00:05:23.888]  But the police didn't believe him, and they just wanted to arrest him.
[00:05:24.628 --> 00:05:29.992]  For legally carrying a firearm that he had a concealed carry license for.
[00:05:30.072 --> 00:05:31.713]  So there is just more evidence.
[00:05:32.054 --> 00:05:34.415]  This isn't about stopping gun violence.
[00:05:34.636 --> 00:05:36.517]  This is about getting the guns.
[00:05:36.817 --> 00:05:46.625]  Do you really think if it was a criminal that was driving on the road that didn't register his gun or that didn't go and get a concealed carry license, but he still has all his guns on him,
[00:05:47.085 --> 00:05:48.586]  You think that guy got pulled over?
[00:05:48.846 --> 00:05:51.368]  No, because he wasn't registered in the system.
[00:05:51.748 --> 00:05:53.049]  And that is the problem.
[00:05:53.109 --> 00:05:56.171]  And there is just more evidence that that's what they're doing.
[00:05:56.211 --> 00:06:00.633]  They are coming after law-abiding citizens who own guns.
[00:06:01.014 --> 00:06:06.257]  But no, it's not just adults who are being subjected to this bizarro police work.
[00:06:06.597 --> 00:06:07.678]  It's also children.
[00:06:08.078 --> 00:06:10.820]  Little children who play with toy guns.
[00:06:11.201 --> 00:06:14.444]  Here we have another story of a kid who was at school.
[00:06:14.984 --> 00:06:26.073]  He was subjected to interrogation without his parents' knowledge, all because he forgot that he was playing with a toy gun the night before and it was accidentally in his sweater pocket.
[00:06:26.414 --> 00:06:32.199]  Now the boy voluntarily told his teachers about it because he knew that he shouldn't have it at school with him.
[00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:42.027]  But instead of using their common sense, the officials freaked out and subjected him to interrogation and intimidation tactics, threats and accusations of lying.
[00:06:42.487 --> 00:06:55.157]  The boy's punishment was one day suspension, which of course is going to remain on his permanent record, and he's also been demanded to undergo counseling and psychiatric evaluation before he can return to school.
[00:06:55.537 --> 00:07:00.421]  And then of course the mother, once she finally was called in after they interrogated her 11-year-old boy,
[00:07:02.603 --> 00:07:08.989]  They then reprimanded her and said she was a bad parent for allowing her son to play with toy guns.
[00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:15.834]  Now the fact that children are being patted down at school is, it's frightening enough.
[00:07:15.914 --> 00:07:22.320]  I mean that's just evidence of how this whole TSA security, enhanced security, has now trickled down through
[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:23.400]  Thank you so much.
[00:07:39.306 --> 00:07:49.579]  It's about training your children that they are going to be treated like terrorists, that they're all guilty, and that they have to respect the authority, respect the government.
[00:07:49.979 --> 00:07:51.200]  That's what this is all about.
[00:07:51.681 --> 00:07:53.924]  Total conditioning and control.
[00:07:54.344 --> 00:07:58.289]  Meanwhile, it's the police with the guns who are the real threat.
[00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:01.551]  They have shot another dog, folks.
[00:08:01.831 --> 00:08:03.992]  Another dog has been killed.
[00:08:04.432 --> 00:08:08.593]  This time, it was outside of a nine-year-old's birthday party.
[00:08:09.073 --> 00:08:12.274]  Here, the video is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:08:12.655 --> 00:08:13.835]  It's pretty heart-wrenching.
[00:08:13.975 --> 00:08:15.295]  I personally can't watch it.
[00:08:15.696 --> 00:08:19.497]  But the police shot a family's service dog just outside
[00:08:19.957 --> 00:08:20.197]  I don't
[00:08:40.956 --> 00:08:41.917]  Get out of the car.
[00:08:41.977 --> 00:08:43.479]  He doesn't wait for animal control.
[00:08:43.519 --> 00:08:45.100]  He doesn't try to call the owners.
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:45.861]  He gets out.
[00:08:46.201 --> 00:08:47.122]  He's got his gun.
[00:08:47.563 --> 00:08:50.045]  And he immediately shoots the dog.
[00:08:50.426 --> 00:08:52.287]  He just shoots this person's dog.
[00:08:52.648 --> 00:08:54.990]  And this is how they respond.
[00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:55.911]  This is how they act.
[00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:56.872]  They shoot first.
[00:08:56.912 --> 00:08:59.395]  They have zero tolerance.
[00:08:59.975 --> 00:09:06.719]  So here we have these cops that are just so scared of a black lab that they just instantly whip their guns out and shoot it.
[00:09:06.739 --> 00:09:18.445]  But heaven forbid if I want to protect myself against a would-be rapist or a home intruder, no, I can't have a gun because then I would be a terrorist.
[00:09:18.905 --> 00:09:20.566]  Only the authorities can have guns.
[00:09:20.706 --> 00:09:22.187]  Only the police can have guns.
[00:09:22.727 --> 00:09:23.108]  And I
[00:09:24.128 --> 00:09:30.851]  Have to just depend on a government task force to just show up and stop a rape or a home intruder.
[00:09:31.251 --> 00:09:37.514]  Now the White House has just posted a memorandum announcing the creation of yet another government task force.
[00:09:37.894 --> 00:09:41.716]  This time they say they're going to protect women from rape on college campuses.
[00:09:42.196 --> 00:09:49.880]  It won't actually do that, of course, but it will create a new layer of bureaucracy that colleges and universities will be mandated to follow
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:59.569]  To ensure that institutions comply fully with their legal obligations to prevent and respond to rape and sexual assault.
[00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:02.092]  Now, come on, let's get real.
[00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:07.538]  This prevention is only going to occur when women take responsibility for their own self-defense.
[00:10:07.878 --> 00:10:11.882]  That means self-defense training as well as firearms training.
[00:10:12.563 --> 00:10:14.824]  The government task force is not going to show up.
[00:10:14.904 --> 00:10:23.648]  All they're going to do is just issue citations for the school if they don't comply with whatever new regulations they have to prevent rape on campus.
[00:10:24.328 --> 00:10:35.953]  I am going to be doing some special reports, getting this training on my own to just stand in solidarity with you women and say it is time that we take responsibility for our own self-defense
[00:10:36.713 --> 00:10:40.857]  Like this young lady here, ooh, man, she gives it to him.
[00:10:40.977 --> 00:10:43.959]  Roundhouse kick to the face, that's what I'm talking about.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.987]  I am gonna get some of that training and I want all of you women to stand in solidarity with me and let's all do this together.
[00:10:53.067 --> 00:10:55.129]  Take responsibility for our own self-defense.
[00:10:55.509 --> 00:11:03.096]  Let's not sit around for Obama, Mr. I-Can-Do-Whatever-I-Want, who thinks he's invincible, to protect us.
[00:11:03.863 --> 00:11:05.106]  Let's take a look.
[00:11:05.166 --> 00:11:08.633]  I'm sure I'm not supposed to, but sorry, we're breaking protocol here.
[00:11:09.234 --> 00:11:10.637]  That's all right.
[00:11:10.737 --> 00:11:12.320]  That's the good thing about being president.
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.342]  I can do whatever I want.
[00:11:14.292 --> 00:11:18.336]  Seems Obama is always breaking protocol to suit his own needs.
[00:11:18.696 --> 00:11:28.064]  That announcement, that comment came just shortly after the White House announced that it would once again be extending the employer mandate, delaying it for another year.
[00:11:28.465 --> 00:11:34.930]  So of course, that is just simply to ease the political tensions that are going to come with this year's election.
[00:11:35.311 --> 00:11:41.116]  And of course, this employer mandate has been changed once again without any input from Congress.
[00:11:41.776 --> 00:11:53.007]  Generally speaking, you get past the next election by changing your policies, by announcing new initiatives, but not by wantonly changing the law lawlessly.
[00:11:53.027 --> 00:11:57.331]  I mean, this is stuff that you do in a banana republic.
[00:11:57.674 --> 00:12:04.816]  Krauthammer went on to say that it's now reached a point where this lawlessness is so endemic that nobody even notices or complains.
[00:12:05.176 --> 00:12:11.178]  That's why Obama just struts around and casually gloats about doing whatever he wants to do because he's the president.
[00:12:11.638 --> 00:12:14.719]  Krauthammer says that these are not adjustments or transitions.
[00:12:15.119 --> 00:12:19.141]  These are political decisions meant to minimize the impact leading up to an election.
[00:12:19.521 --> 00:12:23.322]  It's changing the law in a way that he is not allowed to do.
[00:12:23.982 --> 00:12:28.323]  But obviously Krauthammer didn't get the memo, because Obama does what he wants.
[00:12:28.563 --> 00:12:31.224]  He does what he wants to do, even if it is against the law.
[00:12:31.384 --> 00:12:33.905]  And no one's going to stop him, apparently.
[00:12:34.325 --> 00:12:41.408]  So is it any wonder why government agencies also just do whatever they want to do without any regard to the law?
[00:12:41.508 --> 00:12:43.968]  The law of the land, the Constitution.
[00:12:44.549 --> 00:12:51.611]  Here we have a Muslim woman who finally knows, after seven years, why she was put on the no-fly list.
[00:12:52.151 --> 00:12:56.494]  It's because an FBI agent checked the wrong box.
[00:12:57.115 --> 00:12:57.655]  That's right.
[00:12:58.096 --> 00:13:07.843]  He was filling out a terrorism form, and he checked the wrong box that labeled this wheelchair-bound Stanford University scholar as a terrorist.
[00:13:08.163 --> 00:13:12.467]  She was cuffed, detained, and denied a flight from San Francisco to Hawaii in 2004.
[00:13:12.867 --> 00:13:19.452]  And after seven years of litigation, two trips to a federal appeals court, and $3.8 million worth of lawyer time,
[00:13:21.894 --> 00:13:35.684]  We now know that instead of admitting to the error, high-ranking President Barack Obama administration officials spent years covering it up, asserting the so-called state secrets privilege.
[00:13:36.324 --> 00:13:51.495]  In his declaration, Eric Holder assured the judge that the government wouldn't be claiming national security to conceal administrative error or to prevent embarrassment, but that's an assertion that we now know is impossible because we have the
[00:13:51.715 --> 00:13:52.756]  I don't know.
[00:14:10.529 --> 00:14:23.399]  And we're just supposed to allow these people to just run amok and mess with our freedoms in the name of safety and national security and then they never have to check themselves and they just cover up all their mistakes.
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:36.311]  Now they're still trying to, they're busted because they've been trying to cover up the Bin Laden raid and here the Pentagon is desperate to keep these images out of the public domain and they've been caught.
[00:14:36.931 --> 00:14:43.718]  The Department of Defense gave an order to destroy Bin Laden death photos hours after a FOIA request.
[00:14:44.338 --> 00:15:00.044]  Judicial Watch, they were the group that filed that initial FOIA request, they published an email that was released to them by the Department of Defense and it says that one particular item that I want to emphasize is photos, particularly UBL's remains.
[00:15:00.624 --> 00:15:04.045]  At this point, all photos should have been turned over to the CIA.
[00:15:04.506 --> 00:15:09.988]  If you still have them, destroy them immediately or get them to the redacted.
[00:15:10.828 --> 00:15:19.533]  So, according to Judicial Watch, the email is a smoking gun and it reveals both contempt for the rule of law and the American people's right to know.
[00:15:20.034 --> 00:15:21.835]  So why is Pentagon so desperate?
[00:15:22.135 --> 00:15:23.516]  Is it because the images are fake?
[00:15:23.796 --> 00:15:30.200]  Do the wounds not corroborate with the official narrative surrounding that Navy SEAL raid on the compound?
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.021]  Are they dated from previous years?
[00:15:33.542 --> 00:15:37.084]  Well, last year, Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Seymour Hersh
[00:15:37.244 --> 00:15:46.146]  He said that the whole incident was just one big lie and not one word of the Obama administration's narrative on what happened was true.
[00:15:46.746 --> 00:16:03.431]  And obviously we have other questions that persist, such as why the narrative in the timeline of the raid has changed multiple times, why the White House claimed that those Situation Room photos were Obama was watching the raid live, but now we know there was a blackout on the feed.
[00:16:04.131 --> 00:16:11.055]  Why the neighbors in the immediate area said they had never seen Bin Laden, there was no evidence that he was actually ever at the compound.
[00:16:11.575 --> 00:16:24.382]  And then of course that convenient buried at sea story, that that was the reason why no one ever saw the body, because they buried him at sea, even though it turns out that that wasn't an actual custom that was meant to do.
[00:16:24.442 --> 00:16:26.203]  So there's so many questions.
[00:16:27.083 --> 00:16:29.425]  And it's all just a bunch of lies.
[00:16:29.585 --> 00:16:37.731]  A bunch of lies to brainwash you into accepting whatever sort of reality it is that they want people to perceive.
[00:16:38.532 --> 00:16:40.493]  That's the Perception Deception.
[00:16:40.594 --> 00:16:45.257]  David Icke was on the Alex Jones Show today talking about his new book, The Perception Deception.
[00:16:45.317 --> 00:16:49.941]  I really highly recommend you watch that Alex Jones, that portion of the show.
[00:16:50.041 --> 00:16:52.002]  It's up at the InfoWars.com site.
[00:16:53.243 --> 00:16:55.244]  It is just amazing.
[00:16:55.304 --> 00:17:07.913]  He really breaks down how they are trying to manipulate your mind, manipulate information for this massive mind programming, perception programming for the system to have their way.
[00:17:08.213 --> 00:17:13.636]  And that's why they just lie and they tell you whatever they want to say and the mainstream media will just pump it out.
[00:17:13.976 --> 00:17:20.761]  And if you don't do any digging of your own, then you are going to just fall in line with this perception programming.
[00:17:21.021 --> 00:17:21.341]  I don't know.
[00:17:42.429 --> 00:17:45.371]  Continually being proven to be completely useless.
[00:17:45.992 --> 00:17:57.341]  They say the White House officials either failed to comprehend the situation in Benghazi or they ignored the dramatically deteriorating security there while preparing for the September 11th anniversary.
[00:17:57.901 --> 00:18:19.732]  Well, we already know that they lied about the attack for weeks following, so it's no surprise that just as they covered up their mistake for checking the wrong box on the TSA no-fly list, that they would also cover up their mistakes when innocent people are killed, especially when they need to just push that story to the side so that Obama can win re-election.
[00:18:19.752 --> 00:18:26.276]  That would have been very inconvenient if that had all come out prior to the election.
[00:18:27.176 --> 00:18:30.577]  Basically, believe nothing they say.
[00:18:31.078 --> 00:18:35.919]  Everything that comes out of the controlled media must be scrutinized for spin.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.961]  I mean, it is time to break through this perception deception.
[00:18:41.361 --> 00:18:49.024]  They are armed, they are ready, they are coming after, they are gearing up for war against the free man and free thinkers.
[00:18:49.645 --> 00:18:55.367]  So it is time for all of us to stay in attack formation.
[00:18:56.127 --> 00:19:00.692]  Now stick around because coming up, Jakari Jackson is going to have a special report.
[00:19:00.792 --> 00:19:05.597]  Unfortunately, it's just an update on even more police brutality.
[00:19:06.058 --> 00:19:16.830]  And then Dr. Group is going to share some health tips for you and your family to go ahead and protect yourself with this assault on multiple levels against the human.
[00:19:25.959 --> 00:19:27.620]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:31.383]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on the go.
[00:19:31.503 --> 00:19:35.886]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:19:36.026 --> 00:19:42.010]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:52.997]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[00:19:53.157 --> 00:19:55.779]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gate.
[00:19:55.979 --> 00:19:59.441]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:19:59.622 --> 00:20:16.593]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:20:16.953 --> 00:20:22.257]  Get your Pro-Pure with the new Pro-1 filter today at InfoWorksStore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:20:29.542 --> 00:20:30.382]  The facts are in.
[00:20:30.583 --> 00:20:31.703]  The studies are legion.
[00:20:31.983 --> 00:20:39.327]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:20:39.487 --> 00:20:42.949]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:20:43.309 --> 00:20:43.730]  Simple.
[00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:48.332]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:20:48.612 --> 00:20:54.055]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:20:54.315 --> 00:20:59.700]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation.
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:10.369]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:21:10.649 --> 00:21:12.511]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[00:21:12.611 --> 00:21:14.892]  By blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[00:21:15.212 --> 00:21:17.053]  I use fluoride shield every day.
[00:21:17.373 --> 00:21:22.675]  Secure your fluoride shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[00:21:22.935 --> 00:21:27.176]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[00:21:27.336 --> 00:21:28.617]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[00:21:37.333 --> 00:21:37.514]  Woof!
[00:21:37.574 --> 00:21:37.794]  Woof!
[00:21:37.934 --> 00:21:38.115]  Woof!
[00:21:52.563 --> 00:21:59.606]  At some point, we've all been annoyed by a barking dog or a dog on the loose, and sometimes police are called in to handle these situations.
[00:21:59.946 --> 00:22:04.507]  But is this the type of police response that you would want to happen in your own front yard?
[00:22:05.208 --> 00:22:16.552]  And yes, once again, those dogs should have been under the direct supervision and control of their owner, but with a modern officer carrying things such as pepper spray, was lethal force really necessary?
[00:22:16.972 --> 00:22:18.793]  Let's stay on this topic of lethal force.
[00:22:18.893 --> 00:22:23.096]  What if the gun was turned the other way and the officer was in the crosshairs?
[00:22:23.176 --> 00:22:26.278]  That's exactly what happened right here in the state of Texas.
[00:22:27.019 --> 00:22:34.324]  Sheriffs looking for marijuana burst into a man's home and ran straight into gunfire by a startled resident killing an officer.
[00:22:34.744 --> 00:22:42.069]  The resident was able to avoid a murder charge, but it goes to show that over-aggressive police tactics can backfire on officers.
[00:22:42.469 --> 00:22:46.252]  Over-aggressive tactics such as kicking a woman out of her own home.
[00:22:47.012 --> 00:22:53.777]  A woman was displaced from her home so a SWAT team could perform reconnaissance, much like we saw during the Boston bombing.
[00:22:54.418 --> 00:23:05.026]  But to give credit where it's due, not all officers are out in the streets behaving badly, such as in New York where they just busted up a New York crime syndicate with joint agency cooperation.
[00:23:05.426 --> 00:23:14.894]  So if we have more stories like this, police going after real crimes and going after the real perpetrators and not harassing the general populace, we can break free of this current police state.
[00:23:15.215 --> 00:23:18.811]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:23:35.387 --> 00:23:39.791]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:23:40.091 --> 00:23:42.373]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:23:42.673 --> 00:23:52.362]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
[00:23:52.702 --> 00:24:00.905]  That's why we're rolling out on a 100% made in America line of incredible pro-liberty apparel.
[00:24:01.125 --> 00:24:03.646]  We are re-popularizing liberty.
[00:24:04.066 --> 00:24:08.307]  We are helping fellow Americans rediscover what made this country great.
[00:24:08.688 --> 00:24:09.568]  We are the spirit of 1776.
[00:24:11.088 --> 00:24:13.349]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[00:24:13.429 --> 00:24:18.651]  We are all brothers and sisters in arms in the animating contest of liberty.
[00:24:18.931 --> 00:24:23.114]  In the long march towards humanity's ultimate destiny of freedom.

[00:24:39.904 --> 00:24:48.931]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:24:48.991 --> 00:24:57.238]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:24:57.398 --> 00:25:02.062]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:25:02.262 --> 00:25:08.964]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:25:09.044 --> 00:25:16.125]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:25:16.225 --> 00:25:23.107]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:25:23.247 --> 00:25:27.588]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:25:27.728 --> 00:25:30.969]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:25:31.129 --> 00:25:37.260]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.103]  Available at Infowarslife.com
[00:25:47.964 --> 00:25:58.074]  Over the last several years, there has been a major health awakening on the subject of GMOs, water fluoridation, and the reduction of IQ, and just about everything that's going on.
[00:25:58.234 --> 00:26:07.043]  But the problem has always been a lack of concrete solutions that are free and easy to do, being presented by, you know, natural health experts across the world.
[00:26:07.544 --> 00:26:09.726]  I've always been in my mission to try and offer answers.
[00:26:10.206 --> 00:26:24.797]  But a good friend of mine, Dr. Edward Group, a key expert in detoxification, avoiding harmful substances, the whole nine yards, is here today to talk about five ways, in five different categories, we can completely eliminate things like stress.
[00:26:25.578 --> 00:26:34.183]  Things like arsenic in the water supply, things like environmental factors that are leaching our health from us and destroying our overall cognitive function.
[00:26:34.724 --> 00:26:42.368]  And we're going to have a video series here, five different videos released on a daily basis on YouTube and also played on the Nightly News at InfoWars.
[00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:47.151]  And we're going to discuss five ways to detoxify your body and change your life.
[00:26:47.171 --> 00:26:53.215]  So Dr. Group, let's get into the first, which is clean water and how to avoid all the garbage that's in the water supply today.
[00:26:54.116 --> 00:26:55.257]  Well, Anthony, thanks.
[00:26:55.337 --> 00:27:02.281]  When you look at the body, I mean, the body, any living substance actually, the earth itself is composed of at least 80% water.
[00:27:02.741 --> 00:27:06.564]  So my health secret number one is to drink clean water.
[00:27:06.604 --> 00:27:12.067]  I mean, everywhere you look, when you go to restaurants, the food is manufactured with toxic water.
[00:27:12.547 --> 00:27:20.312]  The municipal water systems contain toxic prescription drug residue, even radiation in some cities.
[00:27:20.732 --> 00:27:21.992]  We're good to go!
[00:27:39.557 --> 00:27:49.504]  Energy drinks, tea, milk, all these other substances out there that can be extremely toxic to the body, all these other beverages with artificial sweeteners.
[00:27:49.884 --> 00:27:54.006]  Now, when I go around and I talk to people and I'm saying, how much water do you drink?
[00:27:54.867 --> 00:27:59.250]  A lot of them say, well, I don't really like water and I don't drink water.
[00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:08.376]  Yet, if they take a tally of everything that they put in their system from the morning when they drink coffee, alcohol, sodas, all this stuff,
[00:28:09.702 --> 00:28:16.723]  Yes, it has water in it, but most of the water in there is actually water that's contaminated with toxic compounds in it.
[00:28:16.783 --> 00:28:22.925]  And it's not the type of water that your body needs, wants, or uses on a regular basis.
[00:28:23.065 --> 00:28:26.265]  All that does is just contaminate the body even more.
[00:28:27.005 --> 00:28:34.607]  And with our research, we found that approximately 90% of the people out there walking around are chronically dehydrated.
[00:28:35.127 --> 00:28:39.028]  Water is an essential, essential element for the body to function.
[00:28:39.668 --> 00:28:42.850]  So here's a simple and easy way to get clean water.
[00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:48.474]  Now, there's a lot of different water purification systems out there available.
[00:28:48.534 --> 00:28:57.261]  People are drinking bottled water now, which by the way, gallon to gallon, bottled water is more expensive than gasoline that you put in your car.
[00:28:58.018 --> 00:29:01.541]  I mean, that's a whole nother marketing ploy.
[00:29:01.561 --> 00:29:05.045]  You know, poison the water and then we can come back and sell you clean water.
[00:29:05.405 --> 00:29:07.587]  But a lot of that water is still not even clean.
[00:29:07.647 --> 00:29:14.794]  So I have a simple technique that everybody's used that I recommend it to, and it's basically drink distilled water.
[00:29:16.351 --> 00:29:22.173]  You can spend thousands upon thousands of money on a water purification system.
[00:29:22.293 --> 00:29:25.494]  And I do recommend a whole house water purification system.
[00:29:25.915 --> 00:29:28.576]  One especially designed to take the fluoride out as well.
[00:29:28.636 --> 00:29:30.696]  And those are available if you look for them online.
[00:29:31.237 --> 00:29:39.980]  But for drinking water every day, I personally drink distilled water with the addition of organic apple cider vinegar added to it.
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.402]  You're getting so many benefits.
[00:29:42.782 --> 00:29:46.265]  There's over a hundred benefits of drinking organic apple cider vinegar.
[00:29:46.405 --> 00:29:57.316]  The raw form with the mother in there, which is actually high in acetic acid, and it turns the body from an acid base into a slightly alkaline, which is great.
[00:29:57.356 --> 00:29:58.917]  That prevents disease.
[00:29:59.538 --> 00:30:03.461]  Organic apple cider vinegar, since distilled water lacks the minerals,
[00:30:04.082 --> 00:30:09.847]  But when you distill water, it takes out all of the chemicals and the components that are toxic to you.
[00:30:10.468 --> 00:30:16.913]  And by the way, you can buy a water distillation system for your home that'll do five gallons a day for you.
[00:30:16.953 --> 00:30:21.477]  So you really only need one five-gallon glass container and then just refill it.
[00:30:21.997 --> 00:30:27.402]  And then just put a tablespoon or a half a teaspoon or whatever of organic apple cider vinegar in that.
[00:30:27.422 --> 00:30:29.604]  Well, Himalayan sea salt works as well to restore the minerals, right?
[00:30:29.684 --> 00:30:30.404]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:30:31.805 --> 00:30:38.868]  But the organic apple cider vinegar and the distilled water, organic apple cider vinegar, you know, there's tons of studies out there on how effective it is.
[00:30:38.908 --> 00:30:52.814]  So you're basically drinking a good water that's an alive water that's full of enzymes, full of minerals, full of nutrients, that helps regulate your blood sugar levels, that helps detoxify your liver, you know, even when people have alcohol
[00:30:53.354 --> 00:30:53.754]  I think so.
[00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:20.634]  And decreasing the amount of other beverages that you're putting into your system.
[00:31:21.114 --> 00:31:24.077]  The body only needs and wants water.
[00:31:24.337 --> 00:31:34.767]  After you're done breastfeeding, your body never cries out for energy drinks, never cries out for coffee, never cries out for sodas, artificial sweeteners, high fructose corn syrup, any of that stuff.
[00:31:34.807 --> 00:31:37.069]  The only thing it wants and needs is water.
[00:31:37.549 --> 00:31:46.397]  Well I think that's a perfect solution because distilled water doesn't have any of the garbage that's in even most of the bottled water, which by the way a lot of it is as bad as tap water.
[00:31:46.798 --> 00:31:50.041]  So you immediately get rid of the additives, the poisonous substances.
[00:31:50.802 --> 00:31:56.327]  And then the always, my concern immediately when you said that actually, because we don't rehearse this, this is all real, this is a real interview.
[00:31:56.907 --> 00:31:57.207]  I think so.
[00:32:24.611 --> 00:32:32.417]  To enhance the way you breathe clean air, to enhance the way you experience the environment with its toxins overloading your body, detoxify everything.
[00:32:32.457 --> 00:32:33.118]  It's all coming up.
[00:32:33.398 --> 00:32:39.703]  This is one of five videos we're going to release daily on the InfoWars Nightly News and the YouTube channels as well.
[00:32:39.803 --> 00:32:48.310]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi with Natural Society and StoryLeak with Dr. Edward Group of GlobalHealingCenter.com and we encourage you to look forward to the latest videos.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:59.824]  Now you can watch the Alex Jones Show live as it happens at InfoWars.com slash show.
