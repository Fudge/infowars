[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:02.851]  This highway leads to the tip of reality.
[00:00:03.972 --> 00:00:11.316]  You're on a through route to the land of the different, the bizarre, the unexplained.
[00:00:12.037 --> 00:00:14.318]  Go as far as you want on this road.
[00:00:14.798 --> 00:00:17.220]  Its limits are only those of the mind.
[00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:23.564]  Ladies and gentlemen, you're entering a wondrous dimension of mind control.
[00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:24.825]  Next stop,
[00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:26.965]  The apathy zone.
[00:00:27.245 --> 00:00:31.167]  Case in point, a naked man runs down the side of a busy highway.
[00:00:31.187 --> 00:00:32.228]  Why don't you have any clothes on?
[00:00:32.248 --> 00:00:34.490]  Yet most people remain oblivious.
[00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:35.710]  Put some clothes on!
[00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.252]  You're on the side of the road, you're gonna get hurt!
[00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:39.993]  Why you gotta be naked?
[00:00:41.254 --> 00:00:42.655]  Why you gotta be naked right now?
[00:00:46.237 --> 00:00:47.919]  Are you in a wreck or something?
[00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:48.679]  What's going on?
[00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:49.800]  Get out of the road!
[00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.241]  Get out of the road!
[00:00:52.745 --> 00:00:54.986]  Just another day in the land of apathy.
[00:00:55.526 --> 00:01:06.150]  Slowing down reality, we can peer into the lives of Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Public as they remain aloof to the clear and present dangers all around them.
[00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.932]  I'm going to bring that guy some clothes, what I could grab from my house real quick.
[00:01:13.893 --> 00:01:14.893]  But, uh, who knows?
[00:01:14.953 --> 00:01:19.375]  I mean, the guy, he could possibly be completely crazy or
[00:01:21.593 --> 00:01:24.614]  He could have been involved in something we know nothing about.
[00:01:25.094 --> 00:01:25.895]  Car accident.
[00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:29.556]  He could have been thrown out of his house.
[00:01:30.697 --> 00:01:31.077]  Who knows?
[00:01:31.617 --> 00:01:32.397]  Oh, you talked to him?
[00:01:32.637 --> 00:01:32.937]  Oh yeah.
[00:01:33.057 --> 00:01:33.718]  When he got over?
[00:01:33.758 --> 00:01:34.578]  Yeah.
[00:01:34.838 --> 00:01:36.199]  What did he do when he got over here?
[00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:37.119]  Did he just sit down?
[00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:39.160]  Nah, he was paranoid, man.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.641]  Okay, did he try to go inside?
[00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:43.579]  Yeah, he went inside.
[00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:45.080]  I was inside when he got here.
[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.880]  Do you think he's maybe schizophrenic?
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.981]  Schizo or on drugs.
[00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:50.201]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:01:50.221 --> 00:01:53.302]  He wasn't saying he was escaping a situation or anything.
[00:01:53.342 --> 00:01:54.363]  He was just... No.
[00:01:55.143 --> 00:02:06.767]  Any state, any entity, any ideology that fails to recognize the rights, the dignity, the worth of man, that state is obsolete.
[00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:09.807]  No, you're gonna be alright, man.
[00:02:10.548 --> 00:02:11.248]  You're gonna be alright.
[00:02:11.772 --> 00:02:15.294]  There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man.
[00:02:16.014 --> 00:02:20.416]  It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity.
[00:02:21.777 --> 00:02:27.939]  It is the middle ground between fight or flight, between stupidity and genius.
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.902]  And it lies between the pit of man's fears and the summit of his knowledge.
[00:02:33.582 --> 00:02:35.503]  This is the dimension of mind control.
[00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:40.005]  It is an area which we call the apathy zone.
[00:02:47.216 --> 00:02:55.059]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:57.420]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.201]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:04.383]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:03:04.683 --> 00:03:07.824]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:03:07.824 --> 00:03:15.154]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:03:15.335 --> 00:03:19.460]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:03:19.641 --> 00:03:21.323]  We are the true media.
[00:03:21.443 --> 00:03:24.027]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:03:24.107 --> 00:03:27.748]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
