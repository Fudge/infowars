[00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.853]  When is a drone picture a benefit to society?
[00:00:07.213 --> 00:00:09.034]  When does it become stalking?
[00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:11.016]  When does it invade privacy?
[00:00:11.196 --> 00:00:13.237]  How close to a home can a drone go?
[00:00:13.257 --> 00:00:19.761]  I'm in my home and there's a demonstration out front and I go to peek out the window and there's a drone facing me.
[00:00:20.381 --> 00:00:25.224]  Well, whoever was running it turned it around quickly and it crashed.
[00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:33.811]  Senator Dianne Feinstein is very concerned about her personal privacy, but thinks it's just peachy keen for other American citizens to be spied on.
[00:00:34.272 --> 00:00:42.219]  The senator claims that the CIA violated the Fourth Amendment rights of herself and her colleagues, a claim that the CIA denies.
[00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:43.580]  No surprise there.
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.264]  The matter is being dealt with in the appropriate way, being looked at by the right authorities.
[00:00:48.864 --> 00:00:55.053]  And the facts will come out, but let me assure you that CIA in no way was spying on the SSCI or the Senate.
[00:00:55.093 --> 00:01:04.146]  We greatly respect the separation of powers between the executive branch and the legislative branch, and we're going to do everything possible to work with the committee in the future on its report.
[00:01:04.406 --> 00:01:15.350]  With a former CIA director being spied on, it wouldn't surprise me at all that anyone in the US, or any place in the world for that matter, could fall victim to the prying eyes of Big Brother.
[00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.892]  And the CIA isn't the only alphabet agency in on the fun.
[00:01:20.532 --> 00:01:27.195]  News Snowden documents show that the NSA is pretending to be Facebook in order to infect computers with tracking malware.
[00:01:27.656 --> 00:01:34.779]  This, of course, is to say nothing of the government spying via webcams, laptops, Xboxes, and cell phones.
[00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:38.121]  So let this be a reminder to the powers that be.
[00:01:38.561 --> 00:01:43.203]  Suppression of rights may start at the bottom, but it always creeps towards the top.
