[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:02.872]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:00:03.613 --> 00:00:06.816]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:14.332 --> 00:00:14.973]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:16.674]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.395 --> 00:00:18.516]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.177 --> 00:00:19.958]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.738 --> 00:00:21.639]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.924]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:30.548]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:49.845 --> 00:01:02.770]  I did a lot of research last night on the different trends taking place in the world after I completed my Sunday evening radio transmission and then this morning I got up at about 6 a.m.
[00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:16.696]  and I did research for several hours but then driving into work when you're calm and not on the telephone or not looking over stacks of news it just hit me that I needed to calmly
[00:01:18.373 --> 00:01:23.355]  Try to take a deep breath and come on air and write down the big picture.
[00:01:25.076 --> 00:01:35.301]  I know we talk about the big overall view of the world by the globalist versus the general public and humanity.
[00:01:36.082 --> 00:01:41.324]  But it's important to really state where we are currently in the history of the world.
[00:01:43.125 --> 00:01:46.427]  So I want to talk a few minutes about that at the start of the next segment.
[00:01:48.365 --> 00:01:50.486]  And then obviously go through all of the news.
[00:01:51.326 --> 00:01:52.926]  And I've talked a lot about this on air.
[00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:59.128]  But it's a phenomenon that happens that I've somehow got to dominate in myself.
[00:01:59.748 --> 00:02:00.428]  I've got to change.
[00:02:00.968 --> 00:02:02.388]  The broadcast is informative.
[00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:03.489]  I have a lot of passion.
[00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:04.889]  I speak from the heart.
[00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.970]  It's not scripted.
[00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.331]  I have a pretty good grasp on the geopolitical systems and how they really work.
[00:02:15.132 --> 00:02:15.972]  But at the same time,
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:26.708]  Sometimes I drive a little too fast and end up wrecking the car on the way to trying to get the pole position and then the checkered flag.
[00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:28.770]  I think we all do that.
[00:02:29.651 --> 00:02:32.574]  But I got so angry yesterday on the Sunday broadcast.
[00:02:32.614 --> 00:02:35.576]  I invited David Knight down here to be on for one segment.
[00:02:35.637 --> 00:02:38.940]  Ended up having him on basically the whole show and Kit Daniels down on the border.
[00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.922]  He'll be back on today with us giving us an update.
[00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:50.549]  That, I mean, I started yelling and screaming and talking over everyone and hyperventilating and literally yelling and screaming during the breaks.
[00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:51.449]  I mean, it's not an act.
[00:02:54.291 --> 00:03:05.359]  And it's because I sit here studying the globalists day after day, hour after hour, week after week, month after month, year after year, dreaming about it as well.
[00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:21.621]  Seeing it threaten my family, seeing the social engineering destroying my world, your world, seeing the psychological rot expanding not just with my own eyes, but I can see the digital readout metrics of it in society all across the planet.
[00:03:24.242 --> 00:03:31.988]  And I realize the reason I'm so disgusted is that I'm beyond anger and hatred of the New World Order now.
[00:03:35.712 --> 00:03:45.717]  I look at these people, and they are just giant piles of stinking garbage.
[00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:58.144]  And I know they're weak, and I know they're pathetic, and I know how they're programmed, and I know how their substratas operate.
[00:03:59.574 --> 00:04:06.297]  And it's very frustrating as an individual that I can't flip the levers to reverse what they're doing.
[00:04:08.357 --> 00:04:22.283]  And it's a very sickening feeling, the opposite of empowering, to realize that I'm smarter and better than even most of the establishment operatives.
[00:04:23.163 --> 00:04:25.224]  And that they're so weak they've chosen evil.
[00:04:26.121 --> 00:04:39.028]  But they've got such a jump on us long-term, building these systems of artificiality and false consciousness, false reality, that they themselves are just programmed biological androids.
[00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:49.794]  And it's then frustrating to have to focus on them all day, and that they become the center of our world, when there's this incredible universe all around us.
[00:04:52.577 --> 00:04:59.381]  But I know the way to beat them and that is to set the brush fires of liberty in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:04:59.401 --> 00:05:03.323]  And we will overthrow this dehumanizing system together.
[00:05:04.044 --> 00:05:06.005]  The only question is how painful will it be?
[00:05:08.186 --> 00:05:12.229]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:16.372]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:05:16.512 --> 00:05:20.034]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:05:20.275 --> 00:05:23.177]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:05:23.337 --> 00:05:30.662]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:05:30.902 --> 00:05:34.544]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:05:34.804 --> 00:05:39.066]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:05:39.226 --> 00:05:45.148]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:05:45.188 --> 00:05:48.970]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.671]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:05:51.871 --> 00:05:53.212]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:05:53.372 --> 00:05:54.592]  It's time to take action.
[00:05:54.752 --> 00:05:56.393]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:06:09.093 --> 00:06:10.854]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[00:06:11.375 --> 00:06:18.339]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[00:06:18.799 --> 00:06:29.226]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[00:06:29.647 --> 00:06:38.873]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[00:06:39.593 --> 00:06:43.014]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[00:06:43.654 --> 00:06:47.095]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[00:06:47.415 --> 00:06:48.976]  Experience the new formula.
[00:06:49.476 --> 00:06:51.437]  Experience the ancient purity.
[00:06:52.057 --> 00:06:53.337]  Shield your family.
[00:06:53.377 --> 00:06:54.778]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:06:55.198 --> 00:06:57.799]  Available now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:06:58.359 --> 00:07:02.340]  X2 from InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:07:07.617 --> 00:07:13.699]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:17.061]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:07:17.081 --> 00:07:18.761]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:07:18.781 --> 00:07:25.104]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:07:25.184 --> 00:07:31.086]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:07:31.246 --> 00:07:34.989]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.092]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:07:38.112 --> 00:07:46.300]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.602]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:07:48.662 --> 00:07:49.703]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:07:50.063 --> 00:07:58.806]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[00:08:36.502 --> 00:08:42.586]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:42.986 --> 00:08:45.427]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:09:03.982 --> 00:09:08.643]  It is Monday, the 23rd day, ladies and gentlemen, of June 2014.
[00:09:08.683 --> 00:09:13.745]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:09:14.545 --> 00:09:17.746]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:09:18.526 --> 00:09:21.147]  Always thought-provoking, always informative.
[00:09:22.227 --> 00:09:31.250]  We're going to have David Icke joining us via video Skype from his TV network studios in the second hour today.
[00:09:35.663 --> 00:09:40.266]  That said, I want to just pull back here at the beginning of the broadcast and look at the big picture.
[00:09:41.426 --> 00:09:45.028]  And then I want to go over the stacks of news that we have here in front of us.
[00:09:46.509 --> 00:09:48.010]  This is just the top of the stack.
[00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:51.332]  Some of these stacks have upwards of 30 stories in them.
[00:09:52.693 --> 00:09:59.817]  And that's why I get wound up and sometimes start the broadcast yelling and screaming because I'm immersed in seeing what the globalists are doing.
[00:10:00.878 --> 00:10:03.239]  It's 100% crystal clear what their plans are.
[00:10:03.259 --> 00:10:04.580]  They're all stated on record.
[00:10:06.479 --> 00:10:07.960]  And that's what hit me this morning.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:13.122]  Is that their program, their operation is so public.
[00:10:15.183 --> 00:10:16.784]  And that they don't even bother hiding it.
[00:10:20.546 --> 00:10:26.829]  Because the general public has been raised under mainstream media and sports and things that don't matter.
[00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:29.771]  And trendiness and Hollywood.
[00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:44.544]  To the point of living in a false reality with a near-false consciousness, a superego-induced form of artificial narcissism disorder.
[00:10:45.657 --> 00:11:03.552]  Whatever particular name you want to give it, to where the public is living in false reality, like a five-year-old girl dressed up like a fairy princess, imagining she's a princess, and really delusionally believing that she's a fairy princess when she's playing on the back porch.
[00:11:04.252 --> 00:11:07.975]  Now that's normal and healthy for a three, four, five-year-old girl to do.
[00:11:08.996 --> 00:11:10.738]  It's not for a 40-year-old woman.
[00:11:12.674 --> 00:11:26.367]  That's completely normal and natural for a five-year-old boy to imagine he's Superman or Batman on the back porch, jumping around, fighting with his friends, or imagining he's a Jedi Knight with toy lightsabers.
[00:11:27.388 --> 00:11:29.330]  It is not the case for adults.
[00:11:30.677 --> 00:11:40.988]  We were meant to imagine archetypes of being a warrior, or being a scientist, or being a soldier, or playing house.
[00:11:41.688 --> 00:11:50.217]  But if a 35-year-old woman has a toy refrigerator, and toy onions and tomatoes, and toy bread, and toy butter, you say that's a crazy woman.
[00:11:51.839 --> 00:11:53.941]  If they're playing with it, believing they're really doing it.
[00:11:55.916 --> 00:12:00.719]  And when I say I want to pull back and give you the big picture, I haven't really studied psychology officially.
[00:12:00.759 --> 00:12:02.620]  I took a few courses of it in college.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:09.283]  I've read a lot of books on it, a lot of history books where I learned real psychology, the way humans really operate.
[00:12:10.184 --> 00:12:16.047]  And modern psychology is very politicized, and you've got pop psychology that the general public
[00:12:17.052 --> 00:12:25.478]  uh... is basically fed on at the trough which isn't real psychology at all but when you get into the real schools of german and british and u.s.
[00:12:25.638 --> 00:12:42.449]  psychology and russian psychology and psychiatry there's a real science there because the elite want to know how to control populations and the approximations and systems they have that aren't political on the surface or aren't pop
[00:12:43.226 --> 00:12:47.727]  Like, there's political psychology saying if you oppose big government, you're mentally ill.
[00:12:48.627 --> 00:12:51.368]  Or if you think there's corruption in government, you're schizophrenic.
[00:12:52.648 --> 00:12:53.649]  You have psychosis.
[00:12:54.769 --> 00:12:55.349]  You're nuts.
[00:12:55.789 --> 00:12:56.509]  You're insane.
[00:12:57.249 --> 00:13:03.391]  That's Soviet-style or fascist-style political approximation.
[00:13:03.971 --> 00:13:06.432]  And any real psychologist or psychiatrist knows that.
[00:13:06.672 --> 00:13:07.772]  It's all very political.
[00:13:10.799 --> 00:13:12.580]  Then you've got pop psychology.
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.540]  They put magazines and stuff in the general public.
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.941]  Has no relation to what's really going on.
[00:13:17.581 --> 00:13:32.547]  But as a layman, I already noticed people would imagine they were tough, and would imagine they were going to start a fight with you, and they were going to beat you up until the real fight started.
[00:13:33.917 --> 00:13:45.227]  Or guys would imagine they were a rodeo star, and would imagine they knew how to throw a lariat, a lasso, and they would hang it in the back of their truck, even though they didn't know how to do it.
[00:13:46.207 --> 00:13:47.468]  It's called being a poser.
[00:13:50.931 --> 00:14:00.980]  And I remember being three, four years old, playing Batman and Robin on my front porch, and clicking and thinking, this is pathetic, I'm not really Batman or Robin.
[00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.751]  I've got all this geopolitical news, all this incredible breaking stuff.
[00:14:06.111 --> 00:14:09.652]  It's just that I want to get the general public out there to come out of their trance.
[00:14:10.733 --> 00:14:18.215]  Now I've since gone and studied psychology, the real psychology, that the PhDs and people read, that the social engineers use.
[00:14:19.622 --> 00:14:21.603]  Not the psychologists you talk to down the street.
[00:14:22.303 --> 00:14:24.044]  And they know full well what they've done.
[00:14:24.324 --> 00:14:32.889]  They've used television in Hollywood to induce men into a false reality of sports and superheroes and comic books.
[00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:35.290]  Arrested development.
[00:14:36.771 --> 00:14:37.972]  And they've induced women
[00:14:39.036 --> 00:15:07.971]  into a fake feminist mode that they're dominant and they're taking over and they're independent and they've got all this power and they don't need men and they're gonna be beautiful and but the husband in the state is their husband that is the state is their husband and their facsimiles following fake trendy programs because they never had an identity and I realize from birth in front of the television being programmed
[00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:25.289]  First they put out programming in the 40s, 50s and 60s where everyone was happy and everything was great and dad was good and mom was good and everybody was straight and strong and America was perfect to get people into a comfort zone trusting the state.
[00:15:26.255 --> 00:15:41.045]  Then they began to roll in by the 70s, the cultural destroying systems, once they had people in a trance, and now they're going into pure programming, preparing people for the nanny state and the end of civilization and humanity as we know it.
[00:15:42.086 --> 00:15:54.294]  And it's all completely programmed, and it's only a select group of globalists, technocrats, social engineers, political scientists that know about it and control it, and they've all written books about it.
[00:15:55.788 --> 00:16:17.749]  Not giving all of it away, but much of it, to be able to understand how to run the system, they need to give some of the Promethean satanic fire of evil, human control, social control, free will destruction, to their subsect minions to be able to carry out the great work.
[00:16:18.866 --> 00:16:28.770]  The shackling of humanity, the shuddering of humanity, the great pulling down by the Lillipullian control freaks of the great titan that is free humanity.
[00:16:29.491 --> 00:16:31.211]  The great conquering!
[00:16:32.432 --> 00:16:33.653]  The great destruction!
[00:16:35.153 --> 00:16:45.438]  Like a hunter gets on a power trip when he lets the bull elephant charge him and then shoots the elephant in the chest with a high-powered rifle.
[00:16:46.431 --> 00:16:53.298]  And watches the elephant fall onto its knees and slide like a locomotive coming to a halt in a pile of dirt.
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.582]  Like a bullet fired into a sandbank.
[00:16:58.704 --> 00:17:00.186]  That's what all of this is about.
[00:17:00.266 --> 00:17:06.012]  And George Orwell, aka George Orwell, Eric Blair, who was a top PSYOP officer in OSS,
[00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:16.154]  Who before that was an imperial secret police officer, who before that was a deep cover OSS communist infiltrator.
[00:17:17.294 --> 00:17:25.678]  He gave it away in an allegory, the parable of 1984, when Winston is tearing his teeth out with pliers.
[00:17:27.418 --> 00:17:28.959]  I've been torturing him for several months.
[00:17:29.459 --> 00:17:31.360]  He said, listen, I could have just killed you.
[00:17:31.741 --> 00:17:36.644]  It's about breaking your soul and having you be delusional because you were a great man, Winston.
[00:17:36.964 --> 00:17:42.667]  And it's about our cult of power annihilating goodness and humanity and justice and truth.
[00:17:42.827 --> 00:17:45.689]  We're going to stomp you to hell!
[00:17:46.289 --> 00:17:48.651]  Nothing will stop the satanic total release!
[00:17:49.171 --> 00:17:49.972]  That's their spirit!
[00:17:51.087 --> 00:17:53.309]  And I'm able to tune into the enemy, folks.
[00:17:53.349 --> 00:17:55.550]  That's why I'm able to understand their operations.
[00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.211]  I can tune into their wavelength.
[00:17:59.173 --> 00:18:01.634]  And I can read their books where they tell you what they're going to do.
[00:18:02.215 --> 00:18:09.600]  Orwell was completely freaked out about it when he finally, as even a high-level officer, clicked to it all when he was brought into the Fabian Socialist.
[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.761]  And they said, man, we're Satan worshippers, bro.
[00:18:12.141 --> 00:18:13.082]  We're gonna kill.
[00:18:13.683 --> 00:18:15.844]  The plan is mass death, hellraiser.
[00:18:16.244 --> 00:18:19.787]  Black uniforms, burning cities, and finally burning the earth to a crisp.
[00:18:22.176 --> 00:18:23.598]  We're gonna murder everybody!
[00:18:23.618 --> 00:18:25.760]  We're gonna do it slow though.
[00:18:28.143 --> 00:18:29.044]  You wanna see the future?
[00:18:29.084 --> 00:18:31.127]  It's a boot stomping on a human face forever.
[00:18:31.708 --> 00:18:34.111]  So, we've had a discussion now about the big picture.
[00:18:35.632 --> 00:18:59.624]  While you're running around imagining you're a fairy princess when you're 45 years old, and while your husband thinks he's manly and struts around other guys, puts on the ball game and does everything, a giant psych warfare, positronic, multi-layered system is assaulting your DNA, your children, poisoning the food and water, all on record, hitting you and hitting you hard.
[00:18:59.964 --> 00:19:01.465]  And you're all delusional!
[00:19:02.285 --> 00:19:04.167]  I mean General Petraeus, all of them.
[00:19:04.908 --> 00:19:12.136]  If you think you're going to escape this system and that you're going to be given the true life extension by the elites.
[00:19:17.321 --> 00:19:23.688]  I looked into Dick Cheney's eyes and I see someone who's scared and had his soul basically sucked out.
[00:19:25.014 --> 00:19:28.917]  And all he knows how to do is act calm and act like he's in control of a situation.
[00:19:29.157 --> 00:19:36.441]  Dick Cheney, despite the fact he's been given an advanced life extension, he's got a big PR facade up that he got standard care in.
[00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:39.043]  Anybody can get this bull crap.
[00:19:42.365 --> 00:19:44.566]  He's out there saying get ready for a giant new terror attack.
[00:19:44.647 --> 00:19:45.127]  Oh, I bet.
[00:19:46.977 --> 00:19:55.184]  Death trains loaded with tens of thousands of illegals pour across as the North American Union is officially founded on the ashes of the old republic.
[00:19:55.605 --> 00:19:56.485]  That's all coming up.
[00:19:57.366 --> 00:20:03.772]  Masses of news today, but I want to pull back one more segment, give you the geopolitical analysis of where we are currently.
[00:20:04.132 --> 00:20:04.953]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:20:08.274 --> 00:20:10.855]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[00:20:10.995 --> 00:20:14.996]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[00:20:15.296 --> 00:20:16.516]  Silverlungs.com.
[00:20:16.696 --> 00:20:19.177]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[00:20:19.377 --> 00:20:22.157]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[00:20:22.357 --> 00:20:24.518]  The Silverlungs generator allows you to make your own.
[00:20:24.718 --> 00:20:26.458]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[00:20:26.618 --> 00:20:31.980]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:35.881]  See the Silverlungs generator and lung delivery system at Silverlungs.com.
[00:20:36.041 --> 00:20:37.521]  That's Silverlungs.com.

[00:21:06.914 --> 00:21:07.254]  Go now.
[00:21:08.027 --> 00:21:13.991]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:21:14.191 --> 00:21:18.373]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:21:18.753 --> 00:21:23.276]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:21:23.696 --> 00:21:26.298]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:31.803]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:38.929]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:21:39.449 --> 00:21:43.213]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:21:43.573 --> 00:21:48.357]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:48.677 --> 00:21:49.538]  This is innovating.
[00:21:49.798 --> 00:21:57.088]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:21:57.268 --> 00:22:01.334]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:22:01.534 --> 00:22:06.741]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:22:07.362 --> 00:22:10.804]  It's been said, those who control the food, control the people.
[00:22:11.024 --> 00:22:14.727]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[00:22:14.807 --> 00:22:20.750]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[00:22:20.991 --> 00:22:31.097]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods, and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system, which accounts for 80% of your immune system.
[00:22:31.217 --> 00:22:32.898]  Take back control of your health.
[00:22:32.978 --> 00:22:35.659]  With Pro-EM1 Probiotic from Terraganics.
[00:22:35.859 --> 00:22:45.881]  Pro-EM1 Probiotic helps protect your body against irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, diabetes, the common cold, and much more.
[00:22:46.021 --> 00:22:50.361]  And including a powerful probiotic like Pro-EM1 is part of your daily routine.
[00:22:50.441 --> 00:22:57.543]  Put you back in control and prevent you from becoming a mindless zombie manipulated by the pharmaceutical and GMO agendas.
[00:22:57.723 --> 00:22:58.543]  Call Terraganics.

[00:23:56.976 --> 00:24:01.260]  That's 30dayfoodsupply.com where they make preparedness affordable.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.401]  30dayfoodsupply.com.
[00:24:12.799 --> 00:24:16.201]  We are in an artificial construct that is not completed yet.
[00:24:16.462 --> 00:24:30.452]  We are in a false reality system meant to induce artificial human activities in the general public on an artificial evolutionary course towards the end of humanity as we know it.
[00:24:31.397 --> 00:24:33.599]  Now again, I've been talking about that for almost 20 years.
[00:24:34.159 --> 00:24:37.242]  When I was first discussing it, it sounded like something from Mars.
[00:24:37.822 --> 00:24:45.589]  Now it's all over Discovery Channel, History Channel, all over Wired Magazine, all over the news, being announced like it's a foregone conclusion!
[00:24:46.049 --> 00:24:49.812]  Humans will merge with machines and no longer be homo sapien sapien by 2035!
[00:24:51.914 --> 00:24:52.735]  Dun-dun-dun!
[00:24:53.015 --> 00:24:53.996]  It's gonna be great!
[00:24:54.376 --> 00:24:55.337]  You're gonna live forever!
[00:24:55.738 --> 00:24:56.899]  You liked NAFTA and GATT?
[00:24:56.939 --> 00:24:57.779]  You're gonna love this!
[00:24:57.839 --> 00:24:58.800]  You loved Obamacare?
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:24:59.501]  You're gonna love this!
[00:24:59.801 --> 00:25:00.902]  You liked the Iraq War?
[00:25:01.002 --> 00:25:01.963]  You're gonna love this!
[00:25:02.263 --> 00:25:03.464]  You like government-run healthcare?
[00:25:03.484 --> 00:25:04.265]  You're gonna love this!
[00:25:05.206 --> 00:25:09.049]  The globalists want to suppress the general public having access to all this.
[00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:11.191]  And I know I restate this every week.
[00:25:12.513 --> 00:25:18.118]  It's because the general public has been induced to care about things that don't matter, to live in a false reality,
[00:25:19.645 --> 00:25:26.791]  And then laugh with their programming, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist, to knowledge that they don't know about because they're so ignorant.
[00:25:27.051 --> 00:25:29.833]  That's the little defense mechanism that they're given.
[00:25:29.893 --> 00:25:34.256]  But now they're beginning to see that, oh, wait, this New World Order's real.
[00:25:34.917 --> 00:25:39.841]  So that's the good news is most people don't laugh at this or make jokes anymore.
[00:25:41.202 --> 00:25:42.903]  But they come up to me and they say, what are we going to do about it?
[00:25:44.141 --> 00:25:49.304]  Well, first off, most people who think they're awake don't really know how big it is.
[00:25:53.006 --> 00:26:02.891]  Or they'll have a attitude like, well, you know, this is just part of evolution, and this is the way it is, and there's nothing you can do about it.
[00:26:04.632 --> 00:26:08.494]  Imagine a general population that believes they don't affect the future.
[00:26:09.275 --> 00:26:11.776]  That's called believing you're disempowered.
[00:26:12.992 --> 00:26:21.616]  On every front, when the animating contest is taking place to decide the future, and you have incredible power, that's why they're telling you you don't have power.
[00:26:23.077 --> 00:26:28.279]  But what they're currently doing... And then I'm gonna come back with the really big news.
[00:26:28.719 --> 00:26:32.781]  Dick Cheney, you know, saying get ready for terror attacks, we're gonna get nuked, Obama.
[00:26:34.322 --> 00:26:36.003]  Dianne Feinstein saying get ready.
[00:26:37.523 --> 00:26:38.984]  Because I wonder about where they're going next.
[00:26:39.004 --> 00:26:41.065]  Let me just tell you briefly where we are currently.
[00:26:42.498 --> 00:27:10.572]  If you read the BAMF Canada documents that were from 2006, Judicial Watch sued 2007, it's in my film Endgame, they say in the meeting with the top 200 CEOs of the world plus, meeting in roundtable events with the leaders, the Secretary of State, Presidents, Prime Ministers and others there, and then the corporations would vote officially in the North American Union Agreement that Bush had signed two years before at Baylor in Waco.
[00:27:11.232 --> 00:27:21.458]  In a secret ceremony with Vicente Fox, that document's still secret, but in the minutes, imagine a secret North American Union that no one's ever been able to see except the front page.
[00:27:22.699 --> 00:27:26.081]  The front page says, we have officially merged Canada, Mexico, and the U.S.
[00:27:26.121 --> 00:27:29.203]  Our militaries will interchange, we'll help each other with insurrections.
[00:27:29.703 --> 00:27:32.345]  That was then put in the John Warren Defense Authorization Act two years later, 2007.
[00:27:33.706 --> 00:27:34.546]  It's all official.
[00:27:34.906 --> 00:27:39.129]  It's all global law, totally illegitimate, but they're moving forward with it.
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:44.812]  You see, they're just doing it because the government is now under its control.
[00:27:45.113 --> 00:27:46.919]  And the big corporate CEO bosses...
[00:27:47.967 --> 00:27:59.394]  Would vote, and then they would give the quote, recommendation in administrative law to the governing heads of the countries, usually secretaries of state or their counterpart.
[00:28:00.014 --> 00:28:04.297]  Hundreds of them were there, and then they returned and began implementing it full speed ahead.
[00:28:04.377 --> 00:28:04.677]  Why?
[00:28:04.897 --> 00:28:12.842]  Because if they implement it, they all get corporate junkets, they all get corporate payoffs, they have revolving doors, and they get a place in the global government.
[00:28:13.402 --> 00:28:19.603]  That's why anybody will tell you, even in mainline political publications, that no one wants to be at the state level or the federal.
[00:28:19.843 --> 00:28:21.244]  They want to be at the international.
[00:28:22.144 --> 00:28:28.205]  The IMF, the World Bank, the UN, the International Bank of Settlements, the EU.
[00:28:28.285 --> 00:28:32.126]  Because you literally have diplomatic immunity, you don't pay taxes, you're above the law.
[00:28:32.286 --> 00:28:32.706]  Look it up.
[00:28:33.926 --> 00:28:35.066]  This is the new royalty.
[00:28:36.346 --> 00:28:38.207]  They have established this.
[00:28:39.361 --> 00:28:42.163]  Obama presses North American Union with Mexico-Canada.
[00:28:42.543 --> 00:28:47.106]  Look, there's the headline from February this year with him saying North American Union.
[00:28:47.466 --> 00:28:48.727]  See, they're uncloaking.
[00:28:50.468 --> 00:28:52.429]  They deny, they deny, they deny it's going on.
[00:28:52.809 --> 00:28:56.091]  Oh, these crazies think the police track your cell phones in real time.
[00:28:56.532 --> 00:29:01.235]  I said that in a 2003 film, The Matrix of Evil, with Ron Paul in a speech.
[00:29:02.179 --> 00:29:03.459]  The film's built around those speeches.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:08.021]  And I said, every cell phone's tracked in real time with the police, but they're not allowed to tell you.
[00:29:08.521 --> 00:29:14.883]  But I've talked to high-level people at the threat fusion centers and seen the documents, and the governor of Wisconsin slipped up and admitted it once.
[00:29:15.103 --> 00:29:15.783]  Here's the article.
[00:29:16.183 --> 00:29:17.184]  Everything's in live time.
[00:29:17.204 --> 00:29:19.204]  They hit one button, they listen to you in your car.
[00:29:19.685 --> 00:29:20.185]  Or in your house.
[00:29:20.525 --> 00:29:20.825]  Boom!
[00:29:21.045 --> 00:29:22.205]  That's now in the New York Times.
[00:29:22.605 --> 00:29:25.066]  Last week, it's in the Columbia Journalism Review.
[00:29:25.306 --> 00:29:30.128]  Today, local cops can track your phone without a warrant, and the government doesn't want you to know.
[00:29:30.208 --> 00:29:30.408]  How?
[00:29:31.564 --> 00:29:35.667]  Well, it's got a satellite triangulator through the cell towers down to three feet.
[00:29:36.047 --> 00:29:37.308]  I mean, how do you think they do it?
[00:29:37.328 --> 00:29:37.769]  I told you in 1996.
[00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:42.873]  And again, you need to listen to me, folks.
[00:29:43.373 --> 00:29:53.261]  There are cancer viruses in the vaccine that embed in your DNA to trigger it when hormone levels go down to kill you.
[00:29:54.301 --> 00:29:56.582]  I mean, it's just, it's pure evil!
[00:29:57.002 --> 00:29:58.162]  I mean, what am I supposed to talk about?
[00:29:58.222 --> 00:30:01.623]  And it's always fun to just throw in, by the way, there's cancer viruses.
[00:30:01.663 --> 00:30:03.144]  They're murdering everyone!
[00:30:03.164 --> 00:30:03.944]  You're being murdered!
[00:30:04.124 --> 00:30:06.064]  The government is murdering scum!
[00:30:06.304 --> 00:30:07.625]  Murdering killers, okay?!
[00:30:08.325 --> 00:30:14.287]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:30:14.487 --> 00:30:18.628]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:30:19.028 --> 00:30:23.630]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:26.632]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:30:26.952 --> 00:30:32.134]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:30:32.394 --> 00:30:39.277]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:30:39.778 --> 00:30:43.519]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:44.600]  Nobody else.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:48.702]  ...has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:49.022 --> 00:30:57.446]  This is innovating, and the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.

[00:31:25.627 --> 00:31:29.911]  I just received my Male Vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[00:31:30.211 --> 00:31:40.396]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.

[00:32:07.904 --> 00:32:11.906]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:32:11.946 --> 00:32:16.088]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:32:16.308 --> 00:32:19.730]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:22.871]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:32:23.031 --> 00:32:30.355]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:32:30.595 --> 00:32:34.217]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:32:34.497 --> 00:32:38.738]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:32:38.918 --> 00:32:44.840]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:48.660]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.361]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:32:51.561 --> 00:32:52.901]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:32:53.061 --> 00:32:54.302]  It's time to take action.
[00:32:54.422 --> 00:32:56.142]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:33:03.644 --> 00:33:04.526]  Or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:33:25.689 --> 00:33:31.771]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:32.191 --> 00:33:33.712]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:36.993 --> 00:33:38.754]  Here's the big picture and then I'm getting into the news.
[00:33:41.975 --> 00:33:48.397]  In their own words, the globalists see humanity as a wild, out of control, ugly, deformed scourge.
[00:33:50.143 --> 00:34:05.938]  Of seven and a half billion people that must be controlled, engineered, and prepared to be phased out because the new technologies are coming and the elite are going to live in this Elysium-type, heavenly, Moonraker meets Zardoz world.
[00:34:09.161 --> 00:34:14.566]  And again, I know our listeners know that, but we have to get the message of endgame
[00:34:15.734 --> 00:34:20.696]  Blueprint for Global Enslavement that is already a seven-year-old film.
[00:34:23.878 --> 00:34:24.538]  Out to everyone.
[00:34:26.319 --> 00:34:31.881]  Because that documentary is even more powerful now and freaks people out when they learn it was made in 2007.
[00:34:32.542 --> 00:34:36.403]  Because just what we said would happen within that time frame happened in the film.
[00:34:36.623 --> 00:34:39.805]  And then we go further in the film and tell you what's going to come after that.
[00:34:41.425 --> 00:34:44.487]  Because the globalists have a blueprint.
[00:34:46.121 --> 00:34:49.146]  And they just tell the unwashed masses that nothing exists.
[00:34:49.426 --> 00:34:50.668]  Fluoride's good for you.
[00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:52.451]  There's nothing bad in the vaccines.
[00:34:52.771 --> 00:34:53.813]  No one's listening to you.
[00:34:54.133 --> 00:34:55.195]  No one's tracking you.
[00:34:55.215 --> 00:34:56.337]  I love you.
[00:34:56.357 --> 00:34:57.038]  I love you.
[00:34:57.158 --> 00:34:58.059]  Welcome to Costco.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:58.620]  I love you.
[00:34:59.902 --> 00:35:00.884]  To quote idiocracy.
[00:35:06.465 --> 00:35:14.287]  The public is being stunned and dumbed down in preparation because the elite openly are moving, and that's why they're collapsing the border.
[00:35:14.547 --> 00:35:28.432]  Because they have treaties, they have secret agreements, much of them public, and just as General Petraeus said in the London Telegraph last Wednesday, we covered it here, they said, what comes after America in a public symposium?
[00:35:28.812 --> 00:35:30.012]  And he said North America.
[00:35:31.813 --> 00:35:33.113]  And that means North America
[00:35:35.771 --> 00:35:41.496]  Not where a Mexico evolves and becomes a freer state, and Canada does, and with high-tech it just becomes we're all open.
[00:35:41.796 --> 00:35:42.197]  No, no, no.
[00:35:42.257 --> 00:35:43.938]  We become a giant Mexico City.
[00:35:44.939 --> 00:35:51.605]  We become a giant failed system forced into compact cities while the elites live in high-tech reservations in the beautiful countryside.
[00:35:51.846 --> 00:35:52.546]  That's their model.
[00:35:53.747 --> 00:35:55.609]  With ground-based Elysiums.
[00:35:59.853 --> 00:36:02.275]  It's all being thrown in your face with predictive programming.
[00:36:05.078 --> 00:36:06.839]  And this is the debate we should be having.
[00:36:10.842 --> 00:36:12.383]  And now they're moving on every front.
[00:36:12.423 --> 00:36:33.356]  I've told you over and over again, as we come towards this flashpoint, you're going to start seeing major proxy wars, major dollar devaluation, major global currency devaluations, building on the crisis, while the globalists ride the crises they've helped create and exacerbate into global governance, world taxes, world regulations, on the ashes
[00:36:34.955 --> 00:36:35.576]  of what was there.
[00:36:35.616 --> 00:36:39.299]  You'll still have Euros, you'll still have Dollars, you'll still have Yens, you'll still have Yons.
[00:36:39.599 --> 00:36:49.667]  They'll be all globally based in an SDR, Strategic Drawing Right, based system that the globalists control, and most importantly, tax.
[00:36:50.228 --> 00:36:53.270]  They don't just want the power to issue and control the currency.
[00:36:54.133 --> 00:36:55.494]  And be able to buy the world up with it.
[00:36:56.174 --> 00:36:58.495]  It's a magic trick, like an unlimited credit card.
[00:36:59.075 --> 00:37:07.339]  The Federal Reserve, which is the European bank front here in the United States, the Rothschild bank front on record, has an unlimited credit card, but it's even better.
[00:37:07.759 --> 00:37:14.722]  They get all the goods, and all the ideas, and all the treasure, and all the real estate, and all the treasure hordes, and all the art.
[00:37:15.162 --> 00:37:16.403]  You get the debt!
[00:37:17.263 --> 00:37:23.366]  When you bank or bail out them, you suddenly are their debtor in Spain or the United States.
[00:37:27.711 --> 00:37:32.512]  That's why there's now in-the-Fed rallies all over Europe where they call it in-the-Fed.
[00:37:32.772 --> 00:37:36.693]  They call their private banks the Fed, knowing it's the same octopus.
[00:37:38.253 --> 00:37:40.194]  You can read that article up on InfoWars.com.
[00:37:40.294 --> 00:37:41.134]  Giant ones everywhere.
[00:37:41.354 --> 00:37:43.394]  People in Europe know because they're in the Depression.
[00:37:44.854 --> 00:37:49.315]  In Spain and Portugal and Greece and Ireland and everywhere else.
[00:37:49.415 --> 00:37:51.196]  They now know, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:55.037 --> 00:37:56.937]  And so as all of this unfolds,
[00:37:58.095 --> 00:38:19.706]  As all of these crises accelerate, the globalists are setting up the police state to try to suppress the public, but that's not going to work if the public looks past Obama, past Boehner, past Cameron, past Merkel, past all of these puppets, to the globalists that of course they want to meet in secret.
[00:38:19.987 --> 00:38:22.068]  Of course they don't want you to know what they're up to and doing.
[00:38:22.968 --> 00:38:26.190]  And just say, there is no global government, there is no man behind the curtain.
[00:38:27.219 --> 00:38:31.884]  Move along, these aren't the droids you're looking for, because then that forces a debate, and it's game over.
[00:38:32.224 --> 00:38:33.525]  Everything is in this article.
[00:38:35.067 --> 00:38:37.569]  If you understand this headline, you understand reality.
[00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:47.539]  And see, I'm suddenly seeing newspapers everywhere, even the New York Times, even the Wall Street Journal, go, did you know that the DEA creates fake cases and fake witnesses?
[00:38:48.703 --> 00:38:51.726]  Because they're really listening to everything in live time.
[00:38:51.746 --> 00:38:55.469]  And when they bust drug dealers, they don't want the public to know they're in the NSA.
[00:38:56.189 --> 00:38:58.651]  And so they then create a fake case for the indictment.
[00:38:59.312 --> 00:39:00.873]  But they don't even want to do that now.
[00:39:00.973 --> 00:39:02.514]  They're just getting the federal courts to rule.
[00:39:02.795 --> 00:39:04.556]  They can listen without warrants to everybody.
[00:39:05.897 --> 00:39:06.097]  See?
[00:39:06.818 --> 00:39:12.302]  But the bigger story is, the sheeple say, well, you know, they're doing that to keep us safe from drugs.
[00:39:12.343 --> 00:39:12.903]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:39:13.243 --> 00:39:17.186]  They only bust the cowboys, the small-level operators,
[00:39:18.243 --> 00:39:21.144]  The whole system is, again, to create monopolies and markets.
[00:39:21.964 --> 00:39:34.488]  So the globalists control the issuance of the currency and credit, but more importantly, with the new global SDR, they want 100 trillion in taxes per decade in one Tobin digital money use transfer.
[00:39:34.908 --> 00:39:45.332]  Once they make you go cashless, like Israel and England have both announced they're forcing cashless phased in within five years, they're penalizing cash, billboards saying it's dirty and bad, why are they getting rid of it?
[00:39:46.764 --> 00:39:51.428]  Because they don't need cash for black market anymore because they'll just digitally ignore their black market.
[00:39:52.148 --> 00:40:00.214]  They want to shut you down and track everything you do and be able to raise taxes at levels to where you can't stop anything they're doing.
[00:40:00.874 --> 00:40:02.736]  Go read the article on Infowars.com.
[00:40:03.496 --> 00:40:05.658]  UK begins beta testing cashless society.
[00:40:07.313 --> 00:40:11.397]  That's why the ultimate sin will be selling oranges or watermelons on the side of the road or corn.
[00:40:11.718 --> 00:40:14.180]  The ultimate sin will be buying cheese from Amish.
[00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:16.362]  The ultimate sin will be a lemonade stand.
[00:40:16.603 --> 00:40:18.945]  As the media says, we're talking arrest.
[00:40:19.285 --> 00:40:22.789]  You don't do it because they're going to shut everything down.
[00:40:23.109 --> 00:40:24.951]  You've seen beef prices more than double.
[00:40:25.171 --> 00:40:28.335]  You've seen overall meat prices up 40 plus percent in the last year.
[00:40:29.656 --> 00:40:32.378]  You go into a diner, it used to be $10 to eat, it's $20 now.
[00:40:32.758 --> 00:40:33.499]  You know why?
[00:40:34.199 --> 00:40:38.963]  They're devaluing the dollar, and they're shutting down the farms and ranches everywhere.
[00:40:39.323 --> 00:40:42.085]  You can't do business, you can't survive, it's all rigged.
[00:40:42.425 --> 00:40:45.508]  Beef prices are record cost, you'd think ranchers would be rich.
[00:40:45.988 --> 00:40:47.549]  It's all rigged with the computers.
[00:40:47.989 --> 00:40:49.791]  There aren't real auctions anymore.
[00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:53.870]  I had a stack of news on that yesterday.
[00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:59.153]  We got to pull out the stack where the World Bank sounds alarm on sharp rise in global food prices, AFP.
[00:40:59.573 --> 00:41:00.493]  What does that mean?
[00:41:01.214 --> 00:41:14.781]  It means there'll be riots, there'll be revolution with the globalists controlling and steering the social networks to shut down the revolutions they don't want and to push the communist and socialist ones they do, which get people deeper into the trap.
[00:41:15.101 --> 00:41:17.122]  Consumer price rise sharply in May.
[00:41:18.376 --> 00:41:22.618]  The feds say it jumped 0.4 after rising 0.3 in April.
[00:41:25.219 --> 00:41:31.402]  Does anyone believe it only went up 0.4 in a month and 0.3 before that?
[00:41:34.564 --> 00:41:36.885]  Does anyone believe in the last year it went up 2.1%?
[00:41:37.945 --> 00:41:41.107]  Food prices, ladies and gentlemen, are exploding.
[00:41:43.085 --> 00:41:45.226]  And again, the media is like, it's good you're poor now.
[00:41:45.326 --> 00:41:46.806]  It lowers your carbon footprint.
[00:41:47.146 --> 00:41:48.607]  It's good all this is happening.
[00:41:48.887 --> 00:41:52.868]  It's good everybody has to carpool or can't afford to go to the park anymore.
[00:41:53.748 --> 00:41:58.750]  But they built us in sprawl where we won't survive now as they turn us off.
[00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:02.991]  It's designed to destroy us, not to make us more efficient.
[00:42:04.138 --> 00:42:07.321]  That's why Petraeus said it's good that we're bringing in all these illegals.
[00:42:07.381 --> 00:42:09.262]  We need a bigger population.
[00:42:09.323 --> 00:42:11.905]  Because you kill 53 million Americans with abortion?
[00:42:14.147 --> 00:42:18.310]  So you replace them with unskilled women with three or four kids or people with diseases?
[00:42:19.201 --> 00:42:25.766]  No, no, they're meant to be attached as welfare queens to then become part of the new political class to bankrupt the country.
[00:42:25.806 --> 00:42:29.349]  We have the documents, not just Cloward and Piven, but agenda 21.
[00:42:29.569 --> 00:42:39.236]  But see, when he goes and talks to a group of sub-globalists, the political right wing in England, betray us as North American Union's the future and we need immigrants to build us up.
[00:42:39.317 --> 00:42:46.162]  Yeah, immigrants we do need, but not to be put directly on the government trough to bankrupt things further.
[00:42:50.345 --> 00:42:53.546]  Central American migrants are on a word-of-mouth exodus to the U.S.
[00:42:55.106 --> 00:42:55.766]  Word-of-mouth!
[00:42:55.826 --> 00:43:01.087]  Biden just said they're going to legalize yesterday and give citizenship as Dream Act to all the kids.
[00:43:03.308 --> 00:43:03.848]  Who began?
[00:43:04.108 --> 00:43:05.168]  Children of the state.
[00:43:05.668 --> 00:43:05.988]  Women.
[00:43:07.108 --> 00:43:10.709]  You run into trendy women and they're just literally, I don't need men.
[00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:12.029]  I don't like men.
[00:43:12.569 --> 00:43:13.750]  I'm going to be successful.
[00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:16.350]  Defeating men makes me successful.
[00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:17.410]  Oh, yes.
[00:43:17.931 --> 00:43:19.831]  What a way to run a society.
[00:43:20.964 --> 00:43:24.709]  They just told black women 50 years ago, we'll give you a check if there's no man in the house.
[00:43:25.169 --> 00:43:25.910]  She didn't like it.
[00:43:27.692 --> 00:43:28.333]  But she did it.
[00:43:29.134 --> 00:43:31.016]  Now the women are like, there's no man here.
[00:43:31.056 --> 00:43:33.099]  That's right, there'll be no man there and he won't have you either.
[00:43:33.319 --> 00:43:35.562]  When you're 65 years old, they're euthanizing your butt.
[00:43:38.547 --> 00:43:43.492]  And now single mothers are turning to online prostitution, as that's the only way they can make money.
[00:43:43.512 --> 00:43:46.776]  In fact, all these government state employees getting laid off, that's what they're turning to.
[00:43:47.016 --> 00:43:50.880]  You see, oh, wasn't it all a great plan they had?
[00:43:51.641 --> 00:43:58.289]  Isolating us, making us artificial narcissists, artificial sociopaths, breaking us down.
[00:43:59.628 --> 00:44:01.090]  And so now they're gonna move.
[00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:17.331]  You're about to see, globally, in fact you're beginning to see it, the proxy wars in Russia, the proxy wars in Europe, the proxy wars in East Asia, the proxy wars in South Asia, the proxy wars in the Middle East, the proxy wars in Africa, and the public is so dumbed down.
[00:44:22.182 --> 00:44:32.725]  That Dick Cheney and Dianne Feinstein and all the usual suspects can say, see, we do need checkpoints and homeland security and increased funding.
[00:44:32.765 --> 00:44:37.607]  We need to continue all these programs that take your rights because Al-Qaeda is everywhere.
[00:44:39.647 --> 00:44:43.008]  And Cheney went on to say there's a whole bunch of groups worse than ISIS.
[00:44:43.328 --> 00:44:44.269]  Don't worry about Iraq.
[00:44:44.289 --> 00:44:45.209]  Don't blame him for that.
[00:44:45.229 --> 00:44:46.970]  No, no, no.
[00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:48.150]  There's all these new groups.
[00:44:51.428 --> 00:44:54.991]  Yeah, out of Saudi Arabia, funded by our government, NATO, the door opened.
[00:44:55.211 --> 00:45:00.875]  Of course Obama's in the news today, saying there's no amount of American firepower that's going to be able to hold the country together.
[00:45:01.216 --> 00:45:03.237]  Obama takes another step back from military action.
[00:45:03.417 --> 00:45:04.798]  People say, oh, he mismanaged.
[00:45:05.239 --> 00:45:07.841]  Oh, he let the Al-Qaeda group, but they changed the name to ISIS.
[00:45:08.561 --> 00:45:11.804]  It's still Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda flags, but, oh, Al-Qaeda's not a problem.
[00:45:12.004 --> 00:45:12.965]  The Tea Party's the main enemy.
[00:45:13.225 --> 00:45:16.027]  And ISIS isn't a big deal either, because, you know, they have a new name.
[00:45:17.288 --> 00:45:20.130]  And only Rand Paul has the courage to come out and say,
[00:45:21.078 --> 00:45:22.921]  No, our government helped create ISIS.
[00:45:23.922 --> 00:45:25.164]  We're going to play a clip of that coming up.
[00:45:26.366 --> 00:45:27.608]  But that's the issue here.
[00:45:27.868 --> 00:45:32.094]  You see, it's so sensational that they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccine.
[00:45:32.354 --> 00:45:34.538]  Just type in polio vaccine cancer virus.
[00:45:36.411 --> 00:45:44.655]  And then you look at the new vaccines, they keep finding them in there, that just so happen to be extremely virulent, and just so happen to be time-released, because it's all designed that way.
[00:45:44.875 --> 00:45:51.099]  They estimate 100 million Americans died from cancers related to the polio vaccine.
[00:45:52.059 --> 00:45:53.460]  On purpose, by the way, boys and girls.
[00:45:55.731 --> 00:46:01.595]  Continuing, ladies and gentlemen, again, I just keep throwing that out to remember who we're under.
[00:46:02.376 --> 00:46:17.146]  Remember what happened, we now learn, a few decades ago in Ireland with thousands of children given experimental vaccines that were actually kill shots to kill them, violent deaths, and then throw them into a giant septic tank to rot.
[00:46:19.958 --> 00:46:21.399]  Oh, we have good guys running things.
[00:46:21.439 --> 00:46:21.820]  No we don't.
[00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:28.164]  And they can run Al-Qaeda publicly and turn Iraq over to it and then act like they didn't fund them and arm them in Syria.
[00:46:29.245 --> 00:46:32.127]  And our media can say, time for the Prime Minister of Iraq to step down.
[00:46:33.028 --> 00:46:36.511]  Openly, our government using Al-Qaeda as a proxy army.
[00:46:36.831 --> 00:46:37.792]  They can get away with anything.
[00:46:39.446 --> 00:46:41.827]  And they'll get away with nuking a major U.S.
[00:46:41.867 --> 00:46:42.787]  city down the road.
[00:46:42.927 --> 00:46:44.407]  I predict that they may do that.
[00:46:44.447 --> 00:46:45.208]  That it's in the cards.
[00:46:45.328 --> 00:46:46.568]  I predict they're contemplating it.
[00:46:46.868 --> 00:46:50.649]  I predicted they would start saying their biggest fear was a nuke going off in Manhattan.
[00:46:50.929 --> 00:46:54.010]  And Obama came out in March and said just that.
[00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:55.410]  Didn't even say who he thought would do it.
[00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:57.331]  Because that's how they take full control.
[00:46:58.601 --> 00:47:01.305]  If you're the globalists that want to conquer America, how do you do it?
[00:47:01.545 --> 00:47:05.671]  You stage a giant horrible attack, claim the Tea Party's working with Al-Qaeda.
[00:47:05.952 --> 00:47:07.134]  Told you that was coming years ago.
[00:47:07.454 --> 00:47:12.481]  Now they say the Tea Party works with Al-Qaeda in Pentagon training drills to take over North Carolina.
[00:47:12.722 --> 00:47:13.463]  Forbes Magazine.
[00:47:19.642 --> 00:47:31.626]  Now, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, we have Dianne Feinstein saying we're going to be killed and that there will be people to disrupt a plot in this country.
[00:47:31.686 --> 00:47:32.426]  So we need her.
[00:47:32.506 --> 00:47:36.107]  We need her to save us from the terrorists they publicly run.
[00:47:36.447 --> 00:47:42.369]  So let's go ahead first and go to Dick Cheney saying another 9-11 is coming, but far deadlier.
[00:47:42.409 --> 00:47:43.189]  And I agree.
[00:47:43.669 --> 00:47:46.170]  Far deadlier, because the people that control him
[00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:49.732]  He's just their little emissary, the mouth of Soran.
[00:47:50.573 --> 00:47:53.615]  The mouth of Soran is telling you, you better be afraid.
[00:47:54.515 --> 00:47:57.418]  And subconsciously, we know the threat's real because we know who's behind it.
[00:47:57.638 --> 00:47:58.178]  Let's go to it.
[00:47:58.659 --> 00:48:02.601]  We spend our time debating what happened 11 or 12 years ago.
[00:48:02.641 --> 00:48:06.965]  We're going to miss the threat that is growing and that we do face.
[00:48:07.065 --> 00:48:10.567]  Rand Paul, with all due respect, is basically an isolationist.
[00:48:10.587 --> 00:48:12.909]  He doesn't believe we ought to be involved in that part of the world.
[00:48:13.389 --> 00:48:14.891]  I think it's absolutely essential.
[00:48:15.011 --> 00:48:16.232]  One of the things I worried about
[00:48:16.932 --> 00:48:25.496]  Twelve years ago, and that I worry about today, is that there will be another 9-11 attack, and that the next time it'll be with weapons far deadlier than airline tickets and box cutters.
[00:48:25.836 --> 00:48:35.641]  And it will be run out of Saudi Arabia publicly, and groups publicly armed by our criminal government, and I'll be called a traitor on air, even though I'll have a hundred clips plus of me saying exactly that before it happened.
[00:48:38.162 --> 00:48:45.766]  In fact, the day they set the nuke off, they'll probably take clips of me saying it years ago and say I said it that day.
[00:48:45.806 --> 00:48:46.546]  They've done that before.
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:56.805]  And let me tell you something, when they set the nuke off, folks, they will probably assassinate me, Rand Paul, Ron Paul, and others hours before.
[00:48:56.825 --> 00:48:59.187]  In fact, that's the only balloon you're going to get.
[00:48:59.227 --> 00:49:06.752]  The only warning will be they'll wipe out the Liberty Leaders, a couple hundred of us, hit teams in one hour.
[00:49:07.553 --> 00:49:15.218]  And once we're gone, so we can't sit here and warn you, they will detonate a nuclear weapon, or they'll release a biological weapon, and all hell, or maybe both.
[00:49:16.018 --> 00:49:18.000]  Remember I predicted the anthrax shot on 9-11.
[00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:18.960]  The anthrax breakout.
[00:49:19.941 --> 00:49:20.882]  Let's go to the next clip.
[00:49:20.902 --> 00:49:24.225]  Let's go to Obama from March talking about the nuke.
[00:49:24.305 --> 00:49:24.865]  Here it is.
[00:49:25.165 --> 00:49:28.508]  The number one national security threat to the United States.
[00:49:29.469 --> 00:49:39.057]  I continue to be much more concerned when it comes to our security with the prospect of a nuclear weapon going off in Manhattan.
[00:49:40.118 --> 00:49:42.820]  Okay, let's now go to another clip.
[00:49:44.116 --> 00:49:46.780]  We've got a Dianne Feinstein as well.
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:47.922]  We've got a couple clips here.
[00:49:48.503 --> 00:49:52.810]  But next up is Rubio, Senator Rubio on Al Qaeda in Iraq.
[00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:54.793]  History is trying to repeat itself.
[00:49:54.813 --> 00:49:55.394]  Here's that clip.
[00:49:56.533 --> 00:50:05.920]  Well, if you look at what happened before 9-11, the reason why Al-Qaeda was able to carry out the 9-11 attacks is because they had a safe operating space in Afghanistan that the Taliban had given them.
[00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:08.581]  And ISIS is trying to repeat itself here.
[00:50:09.062 --> 00:50:14.966]  ISIS is trying to establish the exact same thing in the Iraq-Syria region that they're increasingly controlling.
[00:50:15.046 --> 00:50:26.252]  And then from there, from this caliphate that they're setting up, they will continue to recruit, and train, and plot, and plan, and eventually carry out external operations in Europe, and potentially even here in the United States.
[00:50:26.292 --> 00:50:30.134]  So this is a very serious national security risk for the immediate and long term.
[00:50:30.154 --> 00:50:31.455]  Look at that little talking head puppet.
[00:50:32.315 --> 00:50:35.997]  And again, George Lucas in Revenge of the Sith tells you the whole plan.
[00:50:37.118 --> 00:50:41.280]  The Emperor is running the terrorists that are attacking the planets.
[00:50:42.423 --> 00:50:48.267]  And he uses that to set up a police state to then wipe out the Jedi, then wipe out the rebels and totally take over.
[00:50:49.608 --> 00:50:51.049]  And that's what they're doing with this.
[00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:57.313]  So if anybody doesn't understand this, I've had reporters here 50 times probably say, we don't understand false flag, how's it work?
[00:50:57.734 --> 00:50:58.414]  It's real simple.
[00:50:58.975 --> 00:51:04.739]  You take over by running an outside threat, Al Qaeda, and the reward to Saudi Arabia is turning over the whole Middle East to them.
[00:51:05.419 --> 00:51:06.760]  Don't people understand that?
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:08.121]  More clips coming up.
[00:51:08.801 --> 00:51:12.023]  So my elementary school aged child is begging me for a cell phone.
[00:51:12.103 --> 00:51:13.204]  Please mom, please.
[00:51:13.424 --> 00:51:14.405]  All the kids have them.
[00:51:14.425 --> 00:51:24.091]  But I've seen the research and it makes sense to me that any mobile device that operates using electromagnetic frequencies that close to me or my child's head needs to be blocked.
[00:51:24.551 --> 00:51:26.674]  Harmful wireless radiation is real.

[00:51:45.552 --> 00:51:48.313]  Manipulated financial markets and economic figures.
[00:51:48.593 --> 00:51:49.793]  Chaos on our border.
[00:51:50.233 --> 00:51:52.294]  China and Russia bypassing the dollar.
[00:51:52.774 --> 00:51:54.334]  Life is getting ready to change.

[00:52:08.277 --> 00:52:10.859]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:11.119 --> 00:52:15.983]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:16.244 --> 00:52:24.130]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:24.370 --> 00:52:28.674]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:28.894 --> 00:52:32.717]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:32.857 --> 00:52:37.841]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American
[00:52:37.841 --> 00:52:38.241]  We're good to go.
[00:53:08.368 --> 00:53:10.669]  Listen up all you preppers and survival enthusiasts.

[00:54:13.148 --> 00:54:15.430]  Alex Jones here back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:25.555]  We're going to have reporters the last 30 minutes from the border bridge where the Border Patrol guards the bridge to allow the illegals to come across and only tries to stop media.
[00:54:25.575 --> 00:54:26.735]  They've done it to Breitbart and others.
[00:54:26.755 --> 00:54:27.536]  We've had it done to us.
[00:54:27.576 --> 00:54:32.018]  We're going to be live there on the Texas-Mexico border.
[00:54:32.038 --> 00:54:36.941]  And we've got other reports that they filed last night that we're going to be airing as well.
[00:54:38.544 --> 00:54:51.584]  Now remember, with the backdrop of nuclear weapons detonating, give up all your rights, Obama and Cheney, Feinstein, we've got to disrupt the terror plots, oh my gosh, I'm a hero, I'm Dianne Feinstein, turn your guns in, I love you, but I've got a concealed carry.
[00:54:52.936 --> 00:54:53.816]  You know, we're good people.
[00:54:53.976 --> 00:54:55.838]  Take your shots, drink your fluoride, we love you.
[00:54:55.898 --> 00:54:56.739]  GMO's good for you.
[00:54:57.419 --> 00:54:58.840]  Drink some Roundup, it'll help you.
[00:54:58.941 --> 00:54:59.741]  Help you die, of course.
[00:55:00.542 --> 00:55:14.073]  While these scum run things and tell us give up all our rights and the TSA fans out on American highways and the Army is at public events everywhere searching people's purses just randomly to train you to be slaves, the border is wide open.
[00:55:15.614 --> 00:55:18.437]  So, just remember that.
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:20.261]  And never forget it.
[00:55:20.641 --> 00:55:21.842]  It's all a hoax.
[00:55:21.862 --> 00:55:25.205]  We've got to break with the system and let them know we know you're a total fraud.
[00:55:25.425 --> 00:55:26.126]  And that can happen.
[00:55:26.166 --> 00:55:35.253]  The Australian President, Prime Minister, has now come out and they are shooting down the carbon taxes.
[00:55:36.154 --> 00:55:39.537]  Justices have limited the EPA's shutting down our power plants here.
[00:55:39.557 --> 00:55:42.039]  A huge Supreme Court ruling.
[00:55:42.059 --> 00:55:47.864]  And there's a lot of good stuff happening because it's so outrageous to shut off all the coal power plants when they're totally clean now.
[00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:49.729]  In Australia and the U.S.
[00:55:49.829 --> 00:55:52.910]  and it's hurting people with only a third of them shut down.
[00:55:52.930 --> 00:55:54.630]  I mean, you've seen your power prices.
[00:55:55.090 --> 00:55:56.510]  I mean, going bankrupt ain't fun.
[00:55:56.971 --> 00:55:58.471]  Your kids not having food ain't fun, is it?
[00:55:59.571 --> 00:56:01.551]  While all this is going on, people are getting upset.
[00:56:01.611 --> 00:56:04.712]  Australian Prime Minister introduces bill to repeal carbon tax.
[00:56:05.032 --> 00:56:06.132]  And they've got the votes to do it.
[00:56:08.033 --> 00:56:10.993]  And the Australians have voted out two Prime Ministers who wouldn't repeal this.
[00:56:11.073 --> 00:56:13.934]  I mean, folks are getting angry, they're getting focused.
[00:56:13.994 --> 00:56:14.774]  And let me tell you something.
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:29.667]  Rand Paul picked up on our analysis last year, and we stopped the Syria attack, and after his leadership, Senator Cruz picked it up and others came out, and it became okay to say, hey, we're not Al-Qaeda's air force, Obama's funding Al-Qaeda.
[00:56:30.748 --> 00:56:32.449]  The globalists totally freaked out over that.
[00:56:32.689 --> 00:56:36.371]  That's why they changed the name from Al-Qaeda to I-S-I-S, to confuse the sheep.
[00:56:36.731 --> 00:56:37.472]  That ain't working.
[00:56:38.332 --> 00:56:39.933]  I salute Rand Paul and his courage.
[00:56:41.614 --> 00:56:42.134]  I salute him.
[00:56:42.234 --> 00:56:43.615]  He shouldn't take too many plane rides.
[00:56:44.536 --> 00:56:45.116]  Let me tell you.
[00:56:46.277 --> 00:56:47.818]  He's the real deal, and they know it.
[00:56:48.258 --> 00:56:51.199]  And he's as clean as a whistle, and they know it, and they don't like it.
[00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:56.661]  Anything happens to him, any of these guys, they've been set up.
[00:56:57.041 --> 00:56:58.402]  I don't know about Cruz, but I like him.
[00:56:59.262 --> 00:57:02.624]  But I can vouch for Rand Paul, I've known him for 18, 19 years.
[00:57:03.224 --> 00:57:04.244]  Now, let's get clear here.
[00:57:05.205 --> 00:57:12.428]  He came out, it's a long Fox piece, it's up on Infowars.com, and he said, look, we gave them the safe haven in Syria.
[00:57:14.875 --> 00:57:15.896]  That's a fact, Jack.
[00:57:16.737 --> 00:57:17.958]  And that's the issue here.
[00:57:18.079 --> 00:57:21.422]  Not, oh, I'm not defending Bush or Cheney, they're all part of the same plan.
[00:57:21.863 --> 00:57:23.525]  Oh, was it their fault they took Saddam out?
[00:57:23.605 --> 00:57:24.686]  Of course that was the plan.
[00:57:24.966 --> 00:57:26.929]  Now Saudi Arabia will be given full control.
[00:57:27.449 --> 00:57:29.191]  That's their payoff for being part of 9-11.
[00:57:30.513 --> 00:57:31.494]  And playing along with it.
[00:57:32.605 --> 00:57:33.525]  Man, it's so simple.
[00:57:34.006 --> 00:57:35.226]  Why did Iraq get attacked?
[00:57:35.286 --> 00:57:36.226]  It has nothing to do with 9-11.
[00:57:36.747 --> 00:57:38.627]  Let's go to Rand Paul.
[00:57:38.687 --> 00:57:39.167]  Here's a clip.
[00:57:39.548 --> 00:57:42.349]  We are where we are because we armed the Syrian rebels.
[00:57:42.709 --> 00:57:46.470]  We have been fighting alongside al-Qaeda, fighting alongside ISIS.
[00:57:46.650 --> 00:57:48.511]  ISIS is now emboldened in two countries.
[00:57:48.871 --> 00:57:50.011]  But here's the anomaly.
[00:57:50.352 --> 00:57:51.932]  We're with ISIS in Syria.
[00:57:51.952 --> 00:57:53.273]  We're on the same side of the war.
[00:57:53.553 --> 00:57:56.354]  So those who want to get involved to stop ISIS in Iraq,
[00:57:57.154 --> 00:57:58.895]  ...are allied with ISIS in Syria.
[00:57:59.055 --> 00:58:01.616]  That is the real contradiction to this whole policy.
[00:58:01.636 --> 00:58:10.420]  Right, and many of your Republican colleagues would argue that what we should have done in Syria was get rid of Assad, and that would have stopped ISIS in its tracks, but... But no, but we've done this.
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:10.960]  Look at Libya.
[00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:11.600]  Let's stop right there.
[00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:12.901]  We went into Libya... And that's CNN.
[00:58:12.921 --> 00:58:14.561]  There was another one we got of him on Fox.
[00:58:15.062 --> 00:58:16.262]  He's on there with Candy Crowley.
[00:58:20.004 --> 00:58:21.264]  Also a Lord of the Rings character.
[00:58:21.284 --> 00:58:22.725]  Yeah, I bet you can guess.
[00:58:23.991 --> 00:58:24.872]  Cave troll, sorry.
[00:58:25.432 --> 00:58:27.733]  The point is, gotta have a little humor here, Gallo's humor.
[00:58:28.754 --> 00:58:32.877]  Get rid of Assad, it's not ISIS, it's ISIS-Al Qaeda trying to take Assad out.
[00:58:33.077 --> 00:58:34.177]  You give them a whole base?
[00:58:34.918 --> 00:58:37.560]  You give them a whole country in high-tech weapons, including chemical weapons?
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:39.241]  That would stop them taking Iraq?
[00:58:39.941 --> 00:58:40.181]  No!
[00:58:40.361 --> 00:58:42.823]  That's, they can't take Syria until they're taking Iraq!
[00:58:43.083 --> 00:58:44.104]  This is pure bull!
[00:58:44.864 --> 00:58:45.465]  Pure bull!
[00:58:45.505 --> 00:58:46.185]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:48.607 --> 00:58:49.907]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:51.936 --> 00:58:55.478]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:04.925]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:59:05.005 --> 00:59:07.187]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:59:07.367 --> 00:59:12.470]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:59:12.650 --> 00:59:17.594]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:59:17.794 --> 00:59:20.857]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:59:21.117 --> 00:59:24.981]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:59:25.201 --> 00:59:29.445]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:59:29.526 --> 00:59:39.555]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:59:39.755 --> 00:59:42.278]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[00:59:42.398 --> 00:59:43.298]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:43.318 --> 00:59:44.999]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:13.939 --> 01:00:18.102]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:19.582]  You want answers?
[01:00:20.363 --> 01:00:21.824]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:21.904 --> 01:00:25.526]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:26.086 --> 01:00:30.149]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:43.268 --> 01:00:50.350]  I think we need to build our intelligence to see that we can disrupt the plot in this country before it happens.
[01:00:50.610 --> 01:00:53.711]  Because there will be plots to kill Americans.
[01:00:54.711 --> 01:00:59.713]  That's the witch, the anti-gun monster on CNN, Communist News Network, Dianne Feinstein.
[01:01:00.233 --> 01:01:02.574]  And Cheney says get ready for a bigger 9-11.
[01:01:02.974 --> 01:01:04.895]  Obama says he's worried about a nuke going off.
[01:01:05.435 --> 01:01:06.695]  They're back hyping all of it.
[01:01:06.755 --> 01:01:08.816]  Let's play the Obama and the Cheney again in a moment.
[01:01:09.696 --> 01:01:11.216]  This is what's being pushed.
[01:01:11.256 --> 01:01:12.737]  So the more money you spend,
[01:01:14.741 --> 01:01:26.363]  The more money that you put out, trillions to fight Al-Qaeda, they just changed their name to ISIS, you give them a base to attack Syria, now they take over Iraq.
[01:01:26.723 --> 01:01:29.664]  Obama acts like he's against both sides, but he's letting them take over.
[01:01:32.044 --> 01:01:36.205]  And her answer is, we need more intelligence, we need more money, we need to spy on you.
[01:01:37.105 --> 01:01:39.766]  Meanwhile, the entire domestic spy group is pointed at the Tea Party.
[01:01:40.865 --> 01:01:42.946]  And they're getting ready to blow stuff up and roll it out against us.
[01:01:43.747 --> 01:01:45.148]  You can bet your bottom dollar on that.
[01:01:45.628 --> 01:01:47.309]  And it's not fun to get up here and talk like this.
[01:01:47.369 --> 01:01:48.831]  I know it endangers me and my family.
[01:01:49.731 --> 01:01:59.178]  But my family's in greater danger, and so is your family, as this rotting society really gets to a new level of evil.
[01:02:00.198 --> 01:02:01.179]  The bottom's falling out.
[01:02:01.219 --> 01:02:08.144]  I mean, they got the borders wide open right now, but they're setting up internal checkpoints all over the country to train you to be a slave.
[01:02:09.930 --> 01:02:10.890]  I mean, this is pathetic.
[01:02:11.010 --> 01:02:13.371]  This is our conversion into a total police state.
[01:02:14.832 --> 01:02:16.692]  Do any of you want to live in this?
[01:02:16.712 --> 01:02:21.394]  Because it's not the old saying of, do you want your children to grow up in a society like this?
[01:02:23.975 --> 01:02:29.477]  No, now the issue is, ladies and gentlemen, do you want to live in this?
[01:02:29.577 --> 01:02:35.199]  Because the takeover is pointed at the human family itself.
[01:02:35.319 --> 01:02:38.400]  It's an anti-human, globalist, psychopathic agenda.
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:40.920]  Why did Ted Bundy do the things he did?
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:42.161]  Because he liked it.
[01:02:43.201 --> 01:02:44.541]  Why does the New World Order do the things they do?
[01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:57.144]  Everywhere they're in control, killing foster kids, torturing people to death, molesting children, murdering people, genetically engineering and deforming plants and animals and human life, all sorts of secret experimentation, macabre horror.
[01:02:58.005 --> 01:03:03.246]  I've seen New York Times articles, a couple of them, about the hottest art in New York City.
[01:03:04.537 --> 01:03:09.499]  that sold for twenty thirty million dollars isn't even Vincent van Gogh art.
[01:03:10.779 --> 01:03:17.601]  It's crystal skulls, uh, crusted, uh, crucifix in buckets of semen.
[01:03:18.061 --> 01:03:26.624]  Uh, I don't mean to get gross here, but and billionaires go as a tithe to these weird devil worshiping artists and you read the profiles.
[01:03:27.609 --> 01:03:34.872]  And I'll never forget, I was doing a search for Arnold Schwarzenegger gay porn, so I could put it in my film, Fall of the Republic.
[01:03:38.813 --> 01:03:39.453]  Police state.
[01:03:40.474 --> 01:03:41.634]  What was the name of the film I made?
[01:03:41.674 --> 01:03:42.734]  I've made like 20-something.
[01:03:43.155 --> 01:03:44.915]  What's the big three and a half hour long one?
[01:03:45.375 --> 01:03:47.236]  It's got the blimps in New York and all that.
[01:03:48.557 --> 01:03:49.657]  911, rise of the police state.
[01:03:51.465 --> 01:03:52.085]  That's the name of it.
[01:03:53.026 --> 01:03:53.426]  Anyways.
[01:03:53.887 --> 01:03:55.848]  And so we're doing a gay porn search on Arnold.
[01:03:55.888 --> 01:03:56.569]  We did find it.
[01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:59.731]  And put some blurred out images of it.
[01:03:59.751 --> 01:04:01.732]  And they're just to show because he was getting ready to run for president.
[01:04:01.972 --> 01:04:03.673]  We wanted to have a part of the film to shoot him down.
[01:04:04.814 --> 01:04:08.096]  And it was him in Austria.
[01:04:08.677 --> 01:04:09.477]  No, it was Germany.
[01:04:09.497 --> 01:04:11.599]  And he traveled there just to meet with his favorite artist.
[01:04:11.639 --> 01:04:16.943]  He was like totally white skin, black hair, black uniform.
[01:04:17.143 --> 01:04:18.784]  The artist wears like an SS uniform.
[01:04:20.678 --> 01:04:22.299]  And I forget the artist's name, we've shown this before.
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:34.769]  And it's Arnold looking at the guy's artwork, and it's like four-year-old girls in SS uniforms, dead, laying on beds, with their legs partially spread.
[01:04:36.730 --> 01:04:39.212]  And then the other one is dead babies from car wrecks.
[01:04:40.193 --> 01:04:41.534]  And this is Arnold's favorite artwork.
[01:04:43.315 --> 01:04:45.237]  I mean, that's who these people are.
[01:04:46.658 --> 01:04:49.280]  I mean, looking at it haunts me years later.
[01:04:51.624 --> 01:04:52.826]  Seeing what this guy's into.
[01:04:55.452 --> 01:04:58.357]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side of this quick break.
[01:04:58.838 --> 01:05:00.080]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:05:00.621 --> 01:05:01.804]  InfoWars.com.
[01:05:02.164 --> 01:05:03.246]  David Ikes, coming up.
[01:05:08.925 --> 01:05:10.686]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[01:05:11.207 --> 01:05:18.151]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[01:05:18.632 --> 01:05:29.058]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[01:05:29.459 --> 01:05:38.685]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[01:05:39.425 --> 01:05:42.848]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[01:05:43.488 --> 01:05:46.951]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[01:05:47.251 --> 01:05:48.812]  Experience the new formula.
[01:05:49.313 --> 01:05:51.274]  Experience the ancient purity.
[01:05:51.875 --> 01:05:52.835]  Shield your family.
[01:05:53.216 --> 01:05:54.597]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:05:55.037 --> 01:05:57.619]  Available now at InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:06:09.886 --> 01:06:14.029]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[01:06:14.369 --> 01:06:15.390]  Security alert.
[01:06:15.610 --> 01:06:17.332]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:06:17.612 --> 01:06:18.232]  Analysis.
[01:06:18.472 --> 01:06:21.294]  InfoWars building independent media operations.
[01:06:21.314 --> 01:06:26.158]  But the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:06:26.198 --> 01:06:27.139]  Prime Directive.
[01:06:27.239 --> 01:06:28.660]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:31.562]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:06:31.622 --> 01:06:34.684]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:06:34.884 --> 01:06:37.046]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:06:37.346 --> 01:06:38.667]  People are assaulting us.
[01:06:38.687 --> 01:06:41.028]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:06:41.508 --> 01:06:43.209]  They are never going to stop.
[01:06:43.469 --> 01:06:47.411]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:06:54.455 --> 01:06:55.195]  Imperative.
[01:06:55.455 --> 01:06:57.456]  Destroy Little Minute TV.
[01:06:57.496 --> 01:07:01.878]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:07:01.898 --> 01:07:04.260]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[01:07:07.176 --> 01:07:11.919]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[01:07:12.139 --> 01:07:15.241]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[01:07:15.502 --> 01:07:17.343]  She's just not the woman I married.
[01:07:17.583 --> 01:07:19.544]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[01:07:19.765 --> 01:07:21.225]  Does this seem familiar?
[01:07:21.406 --> 01:07:24.448]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[01:07:24.728 --> 01:07:26.069]  If so, consider this.
[01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:35.235]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[01:07:35.595 --> 01:07:41.618]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.
[01:07:41.978 --> 01:07:43.598]  Forget synthetic chemicals.
[01:07:44.019 --> 01:07:51.682]  Super Female Vitality brings forward key herbs specifically chosen for women's biology without the use of phony additives.

[01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:06.327]  Live life healthy.
[01:08:09.869 --> 01:08:12.070]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:15.331]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.689 --> 01:08:24.054]  Headlines up on Infowars.com on this Live Monday Worldwide Edition.
[01:08:26.356 --> 01:08:30.740]  Police shoot 95-year-old World War II veteran to death with bean bag rounds.
[01:08:31.561 --> 01:08:35.084]  Bill aiming at zero tolerance lunacy becomes law.
[01:08:36.045 --> 01:08:43.291]  If kids at public schools or elsewhere see that you have eaten a cookie and it looks like the shape of a gun, you won't be arrested.
[01:08:44.632 --> 01:08:47.393]  United Nations may soon be paying water bills in Detroit.
[01:08:47.834 --> 01:08:49.294]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[01:08:49.774 --> 01:08:52.436]  UK begins beta testing cashless society.
[01:08:52.856 --> 01:09:00.539]  Senator Feinstein says there will be plots to kill Americans because of the ISIS threat, publicly run and funded by her and her controllers.
[01:09:00.979 --> 01:09:04.861]  Cheney says another 9-11 coming, but far deadlier if you don't give up all your rights.
[01:09:05.181 --> 01:09:11.844]  He actually says, if we ask questions, if we debate this, yes, yes, don't say anything or terrorists will get you.
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:15.761]  Sounds like being held hostage to me.
[01:09:16.642 --> 01:09:28.107]  Hillary Clinton calls for harsh restrictions on alternative media, attacks the Drudge Report, and Bloomberg admits there's a vast liberal conspiracy of billionaire globalist meaning to try to pass gun control.
[01:09:29.718 --> 01:09:33.619]  They're not liberal or conservatives, that's just how they divide their two controlled camps, folks.
[01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:49.365]  They are the globalist scourge, though you do have a libertarian-esque Tea Party move with UKIP here and the Tea Party in the United States, UKIP in England, where David Icke is, and then the Tea Party here in the United States, that is challenging global governance.
[01:09:49.385 --> 01:09:56.267]  You have the Prime Minister of Australia, who got voted in, promising to repeal the carbon tax that's really hurting the people.
[01:09:57.558 --> 01:09:59.219]  Introducing a bill to do just that.
[01:09:59.359 --> 01:10:08.666]  You have the Supreme Court ruling that the EPA needs to stop shutting down all the power plants because the people are getting upset.
[01:10:09.006 --> 01:10:11.168]  The globalist agenda is being exposed.
[01:10:11.448 --> 01:10:13.670]  Here's another headline out of the Columbia Journalism Review.
[01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:22.216]  Local cops can track your phone and they do it without warrants and the government doesn't want you to know how they do it through the Federal Threat Fusion Center.
[01:10:23.095 --> 01:10:27.116]  Again, they don't want to have a debate about the man behind the curtain.
[01:10:27.956 --> 01:10:40.959]  But, totos out there, love them or hate them, like David Icke and so many others, have shocked people out of their stupor, out of their trance-like medical state.
[01:10:41.859 --> 01:10:44.559]  People grown up in front of television, on record, go pull up the studies.
[01:10:45.299 --> 01:10:49.360]  Get Alzheimer's, get brain disorders, just type in, Alzheimer's television viewing.
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.501]  Or type in, brainwaves lowered television.
[01:10:53.664 --> 01:10:55.586]  Or television pessimism.
[01:10:55.646 --> 01:10:58.508]  It causes pessimism that then triples your chances of dementia.
[01:11:00.130 --> 01:11:02.372]  People are watching weaponized television.
[01:11:02.632 --> 01:11:09.898]  They're in a near trance-like state, with the chemicals in the food and the water exacerbating it as an adjuvant to accelerate that.
[01:11:10.939 --> 01:11:19.307]  And somebody like David Icke, with all of his best-selling books and his research, is able to flip a switch with a narrative, whether you agree with it or not,
[01:11:20.131 --> 01:11:25.495]  That so much of it is now revealed to be true, that he's able to get them out of their trance.
[01:11:26.896 --> 01:11:32.200]  You can say what you want about Infowars.com and the way I come off sometimes, but it doesn't matter.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:34.822]  It's real, it's primitive, it's human.
[01:11:36.123 --> 01:11:40.286]  Toto is just a little dog, but is able to pull the curtain back and show the controller.
[01:11:41.827 --> 01:11:48.432]  Who's projecting this big supreme being image up there as a giant floating phantasm.
[01:11:50.069 --> 01:11:52.831]  We're here not to even analyze the politics of it anymore.
[01:11:52.871 --> 01:11:54.031]  We've proven all this.
[01:11:54.712 --> 01:11:59.975]  We're here now to talk to those that are still conditioned and have pre-programmed conditioning.
[01:12:02.817 --> 01:12:07.720]  To understand that you are being controlled.
[01:12:08.954 --> 01:12:11.316]  And that where you're going is a very bad place.
[01:12:11.796 --> 01:12:18.182]  And the reason you feel powerless or the reason you're laughing even though you know you're controlled is because you've been preconditioned and that's artificial.
[01:12:18.722 --> 01:12:23.486]  That's an automatic response that has been programmed into you, literally.
[01:12:24.266 --> 01:12:28.610]  They had that perfected a hundred years ago with the psychology.
[01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:38.218]  Now it's so advanced, but it doesn't matter how advanced the mind control is, if you can step out of it, look at it from the outside,
[01:12:40.037 --> 01:12:48.862]  And realize that there's infinite love and infinite peace in the universe, and that the globalists aren't in even control of this planet fully.
[01:12:49.062 --> 01:12:55.126]  They're trying to get control, building an artificial construct to create a false consciousness, a false synthetic reality.
[01:12:55.366 --> 01:13:01.910]  They've been successful with some people, a hundred percent, others by degree, but there's a giant split happening.
[01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:06.973]  Now either those accelerating their awakening, or those that are
[01:13:08.436 --> 01:13:11.377]  Falling deeper into the control and we shouldn't get mad at those people.
[01:13:11.857 --> 01:13:16.078]  We should feel really sorry for them because it's like the body snatchers already got them.
[01:13:16.118 --> 01:13:16.998]  That's my allegory.
[01:13:17.378 --> 01:13:26.181]  Now joining us is the former world champ, soccer goalie, BBC News and sports presenter, the former head of the Green Party.
[01:13:27.221 --> 01:13:34.367]  Until he traveled to Peru, and I would liken it to Saul of Tarsus being knocked off his horse, literally.
[01:13:34.387 --> 01:13:42.634]  And again, this was 20 years ago, plus, he was just seeing the world a different way.
[01:13:43.095 --> 01:13:47.178]  And some people see the world in a flash a different way, other people it's incremental.
[01:13:47.618 --> 01:13:49.140]  But David Icke
[01:13:50.433 --> 01:13:58.258]  began to do his research then, and so much of what he said that was fantastical is now common knowledge and common place.
[01:13:58.318 --> 01:14:04.381]  So we salute him for his success in getting people outside the matrix and getting them to take the red pill.
[01:14:05.102 --> 01:14:07.063]  And there's only a few of us that
[01:14:08.274 --> 01:14:17.659]  Came in that early wave to not just challenging the New World Order and its political systems, but going deeper into the larger paradigm.
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:22.262]  And I've got to say, again, it's important to recognize trailblazers like David Icke.
[01:14:23.547 --> 01:14:32.693]  It's important to recognize this radio show and you, the listeners, who are just as important as I am, literally half the people I see on the street know who I am now, and most of them agree with us.
[01:14:33.274 --> 01:14:36.156]  Most of the military I talk to are listeners and agree with us.
[01:14:36.956 --> 01:14:43.881]  People are really waking up, and that shows the power I've had in 19 years, the power David's had in 20-plus years, the power you have.
[01:14:44.281 --> 01:14:46.503]  Where is the next David Icke, the next Alex Jones?
[01:14:48.467 --> 01:14:54.512]  You are, in your area, and it's about this journey and this animating contest.
[01:14:54.632 --> 01:15:01.838]  You see the wars breaking out, the famines, the dollar devaluation, the globalists are emerging, announcing their world government.
[01:15:02.299 --> 01:15:06.282]  They announced the United States of Europe with no sovereignty yesterday.
[01:15:06.322 --> 01:15:07.964]  That was in the Financial Times of London.
[01:15:08.564 --> 01:15:10.166]  So, it's all happening.
[01:15:10.206 --> 01:15:14.893]  David Icke, thank you so much for joining us from your TV studios there in London.
[01:15:15.213 --> 01:15:21.401]  I know you want to get into IS-IS and the perfect model of problem reaction solution, but I want to do that in the next segment.
[01:15:21.421 --> 01:15:22.443]  The five minutes we've got.
[01:15:22.463 --> 01:15:24.686]  In fact, I'm going to skip this break so we have more time.
[01:15:26.030 --> 01:15:31.392]  I want you to break down where you think we are, using a football analogy, in the game.
[01:15:32.332 --> 01:15:43.357]  I'd say we were three or four goals behind, but now we've gotten three or four more goals, and we're neck and neck with a quarter left here, and we've got the initiative, but the enemy is going to strike back.
[01:15:44.077 --> 01:15:46.938]  Where do you say we are in this magical time?
[01:15:48.263 --> 01:16:07.959]  Well, I think that this whole ISIS situation in the Middle East is the start of a whole new stage from the point of view of the agenda and there's no doubt that more and more people are beginning to see through the cover stories because
[01:16:09.221 --> 01:16:11.022]  In the end, it's a perception deception.
[01:16:11.082 --> 01:16:12.463]  It's all a perception deception.
[01:16:13.043 --> 01:16:19.966]  It's programming a perception of reality that suits the agenda for you to have.
[01:16:20.586 --> 01:16:27.890]  So, in the Middle East at the moment, we've got a kind of great cocktail of perception deceptions.
[01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:51.649]  We've got the deception that this ISIS came out of nowhere, that it's come out organic and just appeared, and then we've got the perception deception that the ISIS operation is imposing upon its followers that it's some kind of holy war jihad on behalf of Islam.
[01:16:52.189 --> 01:16:52.930]  And so you've got
[01:16:53.750 --> 01:17:11.720]  The perception deceived, going on social media and urging people to become terrorists and join the jihad, and they're just playing their part in destroying what they claim to be fighting for, i.e.
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:16.062]  that whole region of the Middle East and the religion of Islam.
[01:17:17.703 --> 01:17:19.985]  It's a perception deception everywhere.
[01:17:20.005 --> 01:17:28.011]  The perception deception of climate change caused by human activity, which is just a scientific nonsense.
[01:17:28.632 --> 01:17:30.093]  And everywhere you see this.
[01:17:30.833 --> 01:17:36.137]  And if we, I mean, the fork in the road, Alex, is what is your perception?
[01:17:36.177 --> 01:17:37.859]  What is the source of your perception?
[01:17:38.519 --> 01:17:40.260]  Are you having it downloaded
[01:17:41.221 --> 01:17:45.963]  By believing what the authorities in all their forms tell you, all the experts tell you?
[01:17:46.503 --> 01:18:01.369]  Or are you actually taking your mind back, filtering the information, checking it out, looking at alternatives in explaining that same situation, and then coming to your own conclusion?
[01:18:01.889 --> 01:18:03.350]  Because that's the difference.
[01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:08.732]  It's the difference between the free thinker who does not have a
[01:18:10.112 --> 01:18:15.657]  Believe system to defend does not, you know, have a belief system repelling all borders.
[01:18:15.757 --> 01:18:22.182]  I'm not listening to that because if that's anything like true, then my belief system must be wrong and that can't be true.
[01:18:22.603 --> 01:18:29.328]  So you have these belief system people that just resist anything that challenges the belief system.
[01:18:29.929 --> 01:18:31.050]  And if you are
[01:18:32.176 --> 01:18:32.496]  I agree.
[01:18:32.536 --> 01:18:33.757]  Let me throw this at you.
[01:18:33.777 --> 01:18:44.182]  I remember reading, to paraphrase some quotes, of Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister, and these were papers that later came out where he was writing to his propaganda corps and he said,
[01:18:55.598 --> 01:18:57.499]  It needs to be simple, it needs to be dumbed down.
[01:18:57.519 --> 01:19:01.801]  We need to speak to people's laziness, to want to buy into our narrative.
[01:19:02.281 --> 01:19:09.204]  And the truth is 100% public, that for four years almost now, they've been arming on the border with Iraq and Jordan and Turkey.
[01:19:09.784 --> 01:19:14.626]  Al-Qaeda groups out of Saudi Arabia and Qatar, under different banners of Al-Qaeda.
[01:19:14.666 --> 01:19:18.368]  You can see it's the official Al-Qaeda flag of the Wahhabist.
[01:19:19.148 --> 01:19:21.429]  Their flags even say Osama Bin Laden on a bunch of them.
[01:19:21.689 --> 01:19:23.630]  I've learned to read it like I know a Texas flag.
[01:19:24.030 --> 01:19:40.798]  It's them, the black flags of Al-Qaeda, and they have been given a base, trying to take over Syria, kill all the Christians, 300,000 dead, and now they're flooding in, and our own government says, get rid of the Prime Minister, he hadn't played ball, we want to break the country in three, but we're, you know, we can't beat ISIS.
[01:19:40.938 --> 01:19:46.240]  Obama came out today and said, of course they can't beat them, because with a deal in Saudi Arabia for taking the blame for 9-11,
[01:19:47.501 --> 01:19:48.621]  Even though Iraq got attacked.
[01:19:49.362 --> 01:19:51.162]  They are now giving the Middle East to them.
[01:19:51.462 --> 01:19:55.704]  Just like British intelligence set up Saudi Arabia to begin with and had them take over Syria.
[01:19:56.364 --> 01:19:59.245]  And this is setting up the Middle East under Al Qaeda.
[01:19:59.685 --> 01:20:02.226]  And then down the road, they'll probably even overthrow Saudi Arabia.
[01:20:02.266 --> 01:20:03.126]  That's being said now.
[01:20:03.446 --> 01:20:06.287]  And then we'll have a huge, giant war with that.
[01:20:06.627 --> 01:20:09.048]  I mean, it just goes on over and over again.
[01:20:09.388 --> 01:20:10.408]  It's all public.
[01:20:10.788 --> 01:20:11.809]  And as you said, though,
[01:20:13.022 --> 01:20:17.424]  Now Dianne Feinstein, Dick Cheney, all the usual suspects are saying, give your rights up.
[01:20:17.884 --> 01:20:20.846]  Terrorists are going to hit us any minute.
[01:20:21.046 --> 01:20:23.147]  Oh, we've got to stick our hands down your pants, David.
[01:20:23.547 --> 01:20:24.588]  While the U.S.
[01:20:24.648 --> 01:20:27.189]  border is now officially wide open.
[01:20:27.889 --> 01:20:29.830]  And they pay, the Border Patrol pays.
[01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:34.032]  They don't just let them in, they pay to ship them in to the interior.
[01:20:34.112 --> 01:20:38.314]  So it's all a giant hoax, and we've reached this point where they just don't care.
[01:20:38.574 --> 01:20:39.595]  What's happening, David?
[01:20:40.731 --> 01:20:53.980]  Well, you know, in this situation at the moment in the Middle East with this ISIS, and of course ISIS, ISIS is one of the names for the goddess in the religion of this cabal, and if you notice by
[01:20:55.134 --> 01:21:02.418]  By calling it ISIS, they have got news readers and news reporters to use their language.
[01:21:02.618 --> 01:21:06.019]  Like, ISIS forces have taken Mosul.
[01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:08.901]  ISIS forces are closing in on Baghdad.
[01:21:09.121 --> 01:21:11.022]  ISIS has done this, ISIS has done that.
[01:21:12.062 --> 01:21:13.283]  They must be laughing their socks off.
[01:21:13.323 --> 01:21:22.848]  And of course, as you know, all these big events, talk about the Olympics and symbolism, and literally they believe it gives their God power that is now being invoked as lesser magic.
[01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:26.931]  Yeah, I mean, symbolism is just an information field.
[01:21:26.951 --> 01:21:32.994]  You see, the importance of symbolism is in understanding the nature of reality.
[01:21:33.554 --> 01:21:41.979]  You know, I'm talking to you now, and you're hearing words, but the words are not passing between me and you.
[01:21:42.999 --> 01:21:56.344]  A vibrational field of information generated by the vocal cords is passing between me and people listening to me now, and then they decode that, and when they've decoded it, when the brain decodes it, then they can hear the words.
[01:21:56.384 --> 01:21:57.524]  They turn them into words.
[01:21:59.345 --> 01:22:01.547]  Symbols are information.
[01:22:01.827 --> 01:22:13.415]  They're information fields at their base level and they are entering the perception, the mind, not through the ears, like this, but through the eyes.
[01:22:14.055 --> 01:22:23.902]  And the vast, overwhelming majority of information that we receive is through the sight sense.
[01:22:26.112 --> 01:22:36.154]  Unless it's kind of subliminally broadcast, when someone is saying something, at least it's conscious because you're hearing it.
[01:22:36.474 --> 01:22:40.255]  You are aware that some noise, some speech is taking place.
[01:22:40.875 --> 01:22:47.356]  But symbolism, the information fields of symbolism, they are entering through the eyes.
[01:22:47.376 --> 01:22:49.836]  It's a stunning figure.
[01:22:51.557 --> 01:22:53.217]  The tiny amount of
[01:22:54.017 --> 01:23:09.254]  Visual information that we actually register and see that gets to the brain compared with this tidal wave of visual information that's hitting the subconscious and registering at that level without us being consciously aware we're even seeing it.
[01:23:09.595 --> 01:23:13.599]  That's where subliminal advertising comes in and that's where subliminal symbolism comes in.
[01:23:13.899 --> 01:23:14.780]  So it's not just
[01:23:15.888 --> 01:23:18.552]  I'm putting symbols around for a bit of fun.
[01:23:18.592 --> 01:23:30.888]  They're actually subliminally downloading information and what we have in the Middle East, which in this ISIS situation, which I think it's worth emphasizing.
[01:23:32.108 --> 01:23:34.509]  Is the elephant in the living room called Israel.
[01:23:35.489 --> 01:23:52.556]  Now, Israel, whenever there's anything going on in the Middle East, people like Netanyahu and co are up there immediately, can't find a microphone quick enough, saying, it's a threat to Israel, oh my gosh, we need help, or we've got to do this, it's a threat to Israel.
[01:23:53.536 --> 01:23:59.519]  And what's been really, you know, a shouted silence, if you like,
[01:24:00.552 --> 01:24:02.333]  Is that this time, there is none of that.
[01:24:02.433 --> 01:24:28.425]  Now if you're Israel, this sliver of land of less than 8 million people, and this ISIS group is overrunning great chunks of Iraq, threatening to do the same in Jordan, they have an open demand or ambition to take over Syria, Iraq,
[01:24:29.085 --> 01:24:32.269]  And what they call the Levant, which includes Israel.
[01:24:32.570 --> 01:24:36.054]  And chop the head off of the King of Jordan.
[01:24:39.594 --> 01:24:47.916]  Yeah, I've just, this story here, Netanyahu suggests pinning ISIS against Iran, that's the headline, it's in the Jerusalem Post.
[01:24:48.296 --> 01:24:58.319]  But this is what he says, Israeli Prime Minister suggested the United States should largely stay out of the fight and instead allow the parties to weaken one another.
[01:24:59.997 --> 01:25:11.523]  Can you imagine in other situations in the past an Israeli Prime Minister saying that in the face of what's happening with Israel as one of the stated targets of this ISIS organization?
[01:25:11.563 --> 01:25:20.948]  And then you've got the American government that is not kind of being gung-ho as they almost always are.
[01:25:21.028 --> 01:25:23.509]  Oh yes, we've got to go in and stop this.
[01:25:24.250 --> 01:25:27.912]  And it seems to me this, Alex, that what we're looking at is
[01:25:29.732 --> 01:25:50.519]  In the end, Western US cabal dominated controlled operation in this ISIS with its billions of dollars in funding and of course all the American weaponry that it's inherited from taking over parts of Iraq and no doubt inherited in other ways as well.
[01:25:51.159 --> 01:25:51.699]  Benghazi.
[01:25:52.279 --> 01:26:09.945]  We've got this situation where I think that they want this to kick off, they want it to kick on, they want this ISIS organisation to get a bigger foothold in this region, and then at the end of
[01:26:10.985 --> 01:26:11.085]  It's
[01:26:26.673 --> 01:26:38.044]  Albert Pike's scenario in the letter about, you know, playing the Muslim world off against the political Zionists, as he called them, to create World War III.
[01:26:38.244 --> 01:26:45.292]  And, you know, you're starting to see possible scenarios leading in that direction because of what's happening here.
[01:26:45.632 --> 01:26:47.013]  The other thing, Alex, is Iran.
[01:26:48.955 --> 01:27:01.161]  I've been writing in my books for years that the plan was to create a massive rift and war, in effect, in the Muslim world between the Shia and the Sunnis.
[01:27:01.882 --> 01:27:17.170]  And here you have a situation where you've got the allegedly, anyway, Sunni ISIS against the Shia-dominated government in Baghdad, in Iraq, and then you've got the centre of the Shia world
[01:27:18.450 --> 01:27:21.012]  89% of Iranians are Shia.
[01:27:21.452 --> 01:27:27.475]  And so you've got this rather bizarre situation, Alex, recently, which I know people were going, what's going on here?
[01:27:27.895 --> 01:27:45.584]  When after castigating and condemning Iran all these years and saying we need to bomb them, take out these nuclear facilities, they now started, you know, kind of saying, well maybe we ought to have some kind of discussion with them about what we do over this thing.
[01:27:46.084 --> 01:27:56.832]  And I think the answer to why is they want to draw Iran into this Shia-Sunni conflict, because once Iran's involved in that, it'll never get out.
[01:27:57.172 --> 01:27:57.733]  No, no, that's it.
[01:27:57.753 --> 01:28:03.477]  And what you've then got is this mass of interconnected conflict in that same part of the world.
[01:28:04.861 --> 01:28:07.742]  No, that's it, and look, here's the bottom line.
[01:28:08.262 --> 01:28:17.444]  It is a Saudi Arabian, NATO, globalist-backed, giant army formed and trained in Turkey, Jordan, and Western Iraq.
[01:28:17.484 --> 01:28:21.405]  They were given bases, we reported on this three years ago, in Western Iraq.
[01:28:21.505 --> 01:28:21.785]  U.S.
[01:28:21.805 --> 01:28:22.746]  forces trained them.
[01:28:23.406 --> 01:28:27.587]  It's a giant army with thousands of vehicles able to roll right in,
[01:28:28.527 --> 01:28:30.730]  And the Iraqi military was told to stand down.
[01:28:31.230 --> 01:28:31.651]  The U.S.
[01:28:31.691 --> 01:28:37.017]  military didn't go in like the highway of death in 1991 in Kuwait and take them out.
[01:28:37.537 --> 01:28:46.167]  And then now Obama says there's nothing we can do about it because this is an official launch to bare minimum break Iraq into multiple pieces.
[01:28:46.348 --> 01:28:48.750]  Iran may even be double dealing.
[01:28:49.631 --> 01:28:54.095]  And the Prime Minister of Iraq has said this, to get a third themselves.
[01:28:55.176 --> 01:29:04.745]  So Saudi Arabia gets a piece, this new state gets created out of the north and the eastern or western area with this ISIS group.
[01:29:05.285 --> 01:29:11.591]  And then that's a new area to stage attacks successfully and have plausible deniability that the West isn't involved into Syria.
[01:29:11.971 --> 01:29:13.352]  That's the larger plan.
[01:29:14.013 --> 01:29:21.578]  The issue is it's so naked, the massacres they're committing, the evil they're involved in, and then they use them.
[01:29:22.079 --> 01:29:24.441]  Oh my gosh, ISIS, we better take your rights away.
[01:29:24.801 --> 01:29:26.982]  What do they do when there's terror attacks in America?
[01:29:27.002 --> 01:29:28.503]  When we come back, I want to ask you...
[01:29:29.384 --> 01:29:36.348]  Why do you think Dick Cheney's saying, get ready for bigger 9-11, Obama's saying look for mushroom clouds in Manhattan, same thing from Feinstein.
[01:29:37.649 --> 01:29:40.710]  What else do you expect them to pull in this new phase?
[01:29:40.770 --> 01:29:45.893]  Proxy wars in Ukraine, dollar devaluation, food prices going up.
[01:29:46.413 --> 01:29:49.335]  What's the next big shoe to drop in David Icke's mind?
[01:29:49.715 --> 01:29:52.096]  Straight ahead, DavidIcke.com's his website.
[01:29:52.457 --> 01:29:54.858]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:29:55.178 --> 01:29:56.559]  Tell your friends and family, tune in.
[01:29:57.352 --> 01:29:58.235]  We're on the march.
[01:29:58.756 --> 01:30:00.240]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:01.203]  Humanity is waking up.
[01:30:01.303 --> 01:30:03.188]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:03.208 --> 01:30:04.773]  That's where the real march is happening, folks.
[01:30:04.793 --> 01:30:05.274]  Stay with us.
[01:30:08.174 --> 01:30:12.196]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:30:12.236 --> 01:30:16.339]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:30:16.579 --> 01:30:20.001]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:30:20.261 --> 01:30:23.143]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:30:23.283 --> 01:30:30.648]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:30:30.888 --> 01:30:34.510]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:30:34.770 --> 01:30:39.034]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:30:39.194 --> 01:30:45.119]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:30:45.159 --> 01:30:48.942]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:30:49.102 --> 01:30:51.644]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:30:51.844 --> 01:30:53.205]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:30:53.345 --> 01:30:54.586]  It's time to take action.
[01:30:54.727 --> 01:30:56.428]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:31:08.417 --> 01:31:15.482]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:31:15.582 --> 01:31:17.744]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:31:17.944 --> 01:31:23.047]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:31:23.207 --> 01:31:28.171]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:31:28.371 --> 01:31:31.432]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:31:31.692 --> 01:31:35.554]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:31:35.774 --> 01:31:40.016]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:31:40.096 --> 01:31:50.100]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:52.841]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:31:53.021 --> 01:32:01.089]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:32:01.229 --> 01:32:05.213]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:32:08.462 --> 01:32:14.407]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:32:14.608 --> 01:32:18.811]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:32:19.172 --> 01:32:23.736]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:32:24.156 --> 01:32:26.758]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:32:27.078 --> 01:32:32.260]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:32:32.521 --> 01:32:39.404]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:32:39.905 --> 01:32:43.667]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:32:44.047 --> 01:32:48.829]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:49.149 --> 01:32:50.010]  This is innovating.
[01:32:50.290 --> 01:32:57.572]  And the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:32:57.772 --> 01:33:01.833]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[01:33:02.033 --> 01:33:07.575]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:33:10.116 --> 01:33:13.917]  I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.
[01:33:18.364 --> 01:33:20.405]  And I'm all out of bubbles.
[01:33:20.425 --> 01:33:28.967]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:33.189 --> 01:33:35.309]  A lot of times I get hysterical on air.
[01:33:36.070 --> 01:33:37.710]  My dad sent me a text last hour.
[01:33:37.790 --> 01:33:40.591]  He said, you sound hysterical.
[01:33:41.872 --> 01:33:42.612]  Well, you know what?
[01:33:42.752 --> 01:33:43.352]  That's real.
[01:33:44.652 --> 01:33:46.173]  I was a little bit hysterical last hour.
[01:33:47.532 --> 01:33:50.975]  I can get up here and act all stoic and manly and talk real slow.
[01:33:51.735 --> 01:33:53.556]  And I'll do that when that's really how I feel.
[01:33:56.538 --> 01:34:03.864]  But I think I've been successful at waking up about as many people as anybody has out there.
[01:34:03.884 --> 01:34:07.847]  When you talk to most people, they say, who woke you up to what's happening in the world?
[01:34:07.867 --> 01:34:08.707]  They'll say three names.
[01:34:09.448 --> 01:34:11.589]  Alex Jones, Ron Paul, or David Icke.
[01:34:12.870 --> 01:34:15.212]  Three very different individuals in many ways.
[01:34:16.972 --> 01:34:18.874]  But still, we've been the most successful.
[01:34:19.455 --> 01:34:20.076]  Why is that?
[01:34:20.196 --> 01:34:21.157]  We should study that!
[01:34:21.237 --> 01:34:22.038]  We should look at that!
[01:34:25.282 --> 01:34:33.212]  I'm gonna ask David that question in a moment and expand out what this new phase means, but... Some days I'm totally calm, some days I'm screaming for an hour.
[01:34:33.632 --> 01:34:34.574]  Not as much as I used to.
[01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:38.691]  But, I'm not in my comfort zone with what's going on.
[01:34:38.771 --> 01:34:40.892]  Our government publicly changing the name to Al-Qaeda.
[01:34:41.753 --> 01:34:46.836]  You can hear them in PR boardrooms coming up with this new thing, like Coca-Cola, a new name, ISIS.
[01:34:47.416 --> 01:34:48.317]  Makes it sound really cool.
[01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:53.172]  They're committing all these crimes, and it lets me know what they want to do to me.
[01:34:53.532 --> 01:35:01.678]  Wherever Christians are, not big establishment Christians, but old communities of Christians worldwide, the globalists want to go in and exterminate them.
[01:35:01.918 --> 01:35:04.380]  I want to get David Icke's take on that, because I have the wrong numbers.
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:08.302]  The UN even admits that's happening, and I'm getting a lot of other issues with David Icke.
[01:35:10.774 --> 01:35:14.796]  We have some amazing supplements, and I didn't even plug anything last hour.
[01:35:14.856 --> 01:35:15.716]  Skip breaks earlier.
[01:35:15.996 --> 01:35:17.557]  This is also how we fund our operation.
[01:35:17.937 --> 01:35:19.717]  So buy your war bonds in the InfoWar.

[01:35:42.831 --> 01:35:45.412]  We're fighting the prison planet with PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:35:45.432 --> 01:35:47.932]  I want to thank those of you that are members.

[01:35:50.393 --> 01:35:54.014]  We're running a detox special with the Fluoride Shield Chelating Detox.
[01:35:54.834 --> 01:36:01.556]  Discounted massively with the new Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine, the only deep earth crystal
[01:36:02.196 --> 01:36:03.657]  form that we know of existing.
[01:36:03.697 --> 01:36:04.697]  Believe me, we tried to find it.
[01:36:05.038 --> 01:36:05.598]  It was hard.
[01:36:06.038 --> 01:36:08.840]  And it just has such an amazing effect on me and my family.
[01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:19.866]  You can see videos on the website with Dr. Groot breaking down the effects of this and why they put all the bad halogens in the food and the water, but take the iodine out.
[01:36:20.606 --> 01:36:22.527]  And when there is iodine, it's the bound type.
[01:36:22.547 --> 01:36:24.829]  This is the true nascent iodine.
[01:36:26.370 --> 01:36:27.670]  Turns into a purple gas.
[01:36:27.710 --> 01:36:29.692]  We tested other iodines before manufacture.
[01:36:29.732 --> 01:36:30.232]  They don't do that.
[01:36:31.897 --> 01:36:33.578]  This is the real deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:33.938 --> 01:36:36.459]  Research iodine science and you'll find out what we're talking about.
[01:36:36.859 --> 01:36:41.341]  Infowarslife.com to see the still shots, the videos, and more.
[01:36:41.701 --> 01:36:45.722]  The Super Detox Special is more than 30% off when you get both bottles together.

[01:36:46.903 --> 01:36:48.883]  We're gonna sell out this week of the Lung Cleanse.
[01:36:49.384 --> 01:36:51.144]  It'll be another month until more of that comes in.

[01:37:20.231 --> 01:37:22.071]  I only believe in win-win-wins.
[01:37:22.251 --> 01:37:23.712]  I only, I'm obsessed with it.
[01:37:24.272 --> 01:37:25.812]  And I noticed my whole life I've done that.
[01:37:26.252 --> 01:37:28.253]  That's why I've been successful and I sleep well at night.
[01:37:28.873 --> 01:37:31.594]  But now, I'm more and more become totally obsessed with it.
[01:37:32.254 --> 01:37:34.174]  I mean, it's gotta be a win-win-win-win-win.
[01:37:34.214 --> 01:37:44.576]  And everything at Infowars.com, at PrisonPlanet.com, at InfowarsStore.com, at InfowarsHealth.com, at InfowarsLife.com is a win-win-win-win-win.
[01:37:44.936 --> 01:37:45.877]  That is my philosophy.
[01:37:46.117 --> 01:37:46.977]  With the globalist,
[01:37:47.895 --> 01:37:52.199]  They'll go a hundred miles out of their way to make sure you don't get anything from them.
[01:37:53.060 --> 01:38:01.708]  We've all run into people that don't like making you dinner, don't like making you feel good, don't like, don't have hospitality.
[01:38:03.410 --> 01:38:07.992]  The type of people that really enjoy thinking they get something, you get nothing.
[01:38:08.773 --> 01:38:12.915]  And that's the New World Order predatory philosophy.
[01:38:13.075 --> 01:38:15.736]  And there's a battle for the future of this planet.
[01:38:16.016 --> 01:38:17.717]  DavidIke.com is his website.
[01:38:18.057 --> 01:38:19.338]  We're very honored to have him on with us today.
[01:38:19.358 --> 01:38:26.502]  I'm going to try to give him the floor now and let him break down all the questions I've thrown out about what is this next level the elite are moving into.
[01:38:26.962 --> 01:38:30.764]  In the football game analogy, we are seeing a big awakening, but
[01:38:32.136 --> 01:38:34.227]  Where does he expect all this to go, David Icke?
[01:38:36.664 --> 01:38:44.247]  Well, it's been a progression, clearly, along a road going way back.
[01:38:44.887 --> 01:38:58.492]  You know, people like George Orwell and Aldous Huxley with 1984 and Brave New World, they weren't coming from their imagination entirely, or even much of it.
[01:38:58.652 --> 01:39:02.433]  They were coming from a point of view of having access to the projected agenda.
[01:39:02.493 --> 01:39:03.253]  And they both said that.
[01:39:03.313 --> 01:39:04.894]  They both said that in public white papers.
[01:39:05.934 --> 01:39:17.638]  And, you know, in my last couple of books I quoted a man called Dr. Richard Day, who was a Rockefeller insider.
[01:39:17.698 --> 01:39:20.859]  He was an executive of Planned Parenthood.
[01:39:21.779 --> 01:39:32.062]  And in 1969 he was addressing a meeting of pediatricians in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
[01:39:32.922 --> 01:39:43.331]  And for some reason, only he knows, he asked people to not take notes and not record anything because he was going to tell them how the world was going to change.
[01:39:44.512 --> 01:39:50.336]  And what he then did was tell them what was coming and why.
[01:39:50.356 --> 01:39:58.543]  And one of the pediatricians did take notes and later did some interviews before he died explaining what this Richard Day said.
[01:39:58.563 --> 01:40:00.805]  And what Richard Day described
[01:40:01.952 --> 01:40:04.237]  And remember 1969, you know, it's 20 years after Orwell.
[01:40:11.425 --> 01:40:18.430]  He was describing the world we're living in today, or moving more and more in today, in all aspects of society.
[01:40:18.930 --> 01:40:25.294]  This is a plan that is projected forward in great detail.
[01:40:26.395 --> 01:40:34.500]  Therefore, what's coming is what they plan to come, and that will be upping the ante.
[01:40:34.621 --> 01:40:36.382]  It will be increasing the pressure.
[01:40:36.402 --> 01:40:40.725]  It will be moving further along the road in all these different areas, everything from
[01:40:41.725 --> 01:40:48.167]  GMO and food, to additives like that, to the radiation agenda, which is phenomenal.
[01:40:48.187 --> 01:40:49.967]  You mentioned iodine a few minutes ago, Alex.
[01:40:52.148 --> 01:41:04.471]  Millions and millions and millions of times more radiation, technologically generated, than there was 50 years ago, that we're now kind of living in, like this sea of technological radiation.
[01:41:04.591 --> 01:41:05.851]  And given that
[01:41:07.029 --> 01:41:27.228]  We have an electromagnetic field, an electromagnetic level, that is going to impact and does impact upon us, and if the electromagnetic level, the electromagnetic field, which some people call the auric field, is disrupted by technological radiation, that plays through into the body as a distortion and a disruption, and we call that mental or emotional or physical dis-ease.
[01:41:29.730 --> 01:41:43.080]  Progressing, just as we can look back and see how it's progressed, but of course there are certain points where it progresses very fast because of events that are orchestrated, and of course the best example of that is 9-11.
[01:41:44.562 --> 01:41:52.089]  Where the agenda moved forward more in the ten years after 9-11 than it had in a lot longer time before that.
[01:41:52.610 --> 01:42:06.803]  And when Cheney's talking about another 9-11, when Lindsey Graham, when he opens his mouth, just like John McCain, he is speaking the Cabal's agenda, he's talking about another 9-11, over here
[01:42:09.145 --> 01:42:20.520]  We're getting just the same, Alex, with the Prime Minister David Cameron warning about, oh, we've got to increase surveillance because of the terrorists coming back to Britain.
[01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:23.183]  We've got this guy today, Liam Fox.
[01:42:23.924 --> 01:42:24.885]  Liam Fox is a
[01:42:25.885 --> 01:42:28.946]  British politician who's simply an agent of Israel.
[01:42:29.086 --> 01:42:29.546]  That's all he is.
[01:42:29.706 --> 01:42:31.046]  He's an agent of Israel.
[01:42:31.927 --> 01:42:44.290]  And he has come out today and said we need to have more surveillance, etc., more Big Brother in effect, to meet the challenge from jihadists coming back to Britain.
[01:42:45.891 --> 01:42:56.360]  We are facing this fork in the road between the freethinkers and between those that just accept the agenda and download it, you know, bar, bar, bar.
[01:42:57.241 --> 01:43:04.748]  And the number that go that way or that way will decide where we go as a human race, because we've shown
[01:43:05.754 --> 01:43:16.199]  When they wanted to move the Syrian invasion, which is what it is in fact, they wanted to move that along because it was behind the timeline.
[01:43:17.380 --> 01:43:32.748]  People opposing that stopped that bombardment and affected the agenda because, you know, people like you and me and all the others that do this, the idea is not to be proved right, it's for
[01:43:33.448 --> 01:43:37.050]  What the agenda is not to happen.
[01:43:37.170 --> 01:43:40.591]  It's about using that information to head off what's happening.
[01:43:41.652 --> 01:43:46.934]  And so it's not just about, you know, watching your own prison being built.
[01:43:46.994 --> 01:43:47.314]  Oh, look.
[01:43:47.394 --> 01:43:47.754]  Oh, yeah.
[01:43:47.835 --> 01:43:48.795]  Oh, they're putting the roof on now.
[01:43:48.815 --> 01:43:49.395]  Look, you see that?
[01:43:49.415 --> 01:43:50.916]  I told you they'd do that, didn't I?
[01:43:51.136 --> 01:43:52.937]  We need to stop the roof going on.
[01:43:53.737 --> 01:44:01.881]  And one of the things that is fundamental to that is that we put down the fault lines of divide and rule because
[01:44:03.030 --> 01:44:06.972]  What's happening in the Muslim world in the Middle East is just classic divide and rule.
[01:44:07.573 --> 01:44:17.879]  We have different factions of politics, we have religions played off against each other, we have scientific belief systems played off against religious belief systems.
[01:44:18.619 --> 01:44:29.205]  We need to put that down and say, hold on a second, there's a common theme here and that's that we're all the target for this unfolding global fascist agenda and therefore
[01:44:30.706 --> 01:44:49.477]  If we don't come together now and put down our differences and focus on what should unite us all and that's what is going to affect us all and is affecting us all, then when we're in some concentration camp eventually, if we get that far, then we can have a lovely discussion over who's got the best religion and who's got the best politics and who's got the best whatever.
[01:44:50.157 --> 01:44:51.418]  But by then it will be too late.
[01:44:52.179 --> 01:45:07.032]  And what they want, if you're targeting a vast population, and there's comparatively few of you, and my goodness it's so few at the core, in the shadows, in the centre, then you have to divide and rule the target population.
[01:45:07.092 --> 01:45:09.874]  And we allow it to happen so easily.
[01:45:09.894 --> 01:45:12.216]  I mean, look at the Middle East.
[01:45:12.597 --> 01:45:16.660]  I mean, we have people at war with each other,
[01:45:17.805 --> 01:45:24.834]  Over some argument, centuries ago, over who should be the natural or the right replacement for Mohammed!
[01:45:25.785 --> 01:45:27.786]  I mean, are we children?
[01:45:28.506 --> 01:45:32.748]  Are we mature adults, or are we children?
[01:45:32.788 --> 01:45:39.071]  And I'm sorry, in some cases, like what's happening in the Middle East, I apologise to children for using that analogy.
[01:45:39.571 --> 01:45:44.313]  But this is happening all over the place, where people are played off against each other.
[01:45:44.353 --> 01:45:47.374]  And while we're divided and ruled, we will be one thing.
[01:45:47.434 --> 01:45:48.235]  We'll be ruled.
[01:45:48.875 --> 01:45:49.876]  It's in our hands.
[01:45:49.976 --> 01:45:51.097]  We have the numbers.
[01:45:51.417 --> 01:45:52.898]  But only if we come together.
[01:45:53.258 --> 01:45:54.719]  I don't care what your religion is.
[01:45:54.979 --> 01:45:57.761]  I don't care what your politics are.
[01:45:58.101 --> 01:46:00.683]  I care if you truly care about freedom for everybody.
[01:46:01.023 --> 01:46:01.964]  Then we've got a chance.
[01:46:02.745 --> 01:46:05.987]  David, when I raise this point, it's not for us to talk about how great we are.
[01:46:06.007 --> 01:46:07.168]  More and more I realize
[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:16.707]  The fact that I've been so successful, you've been so successful, Ron Paul and others have been so successful, because I get the calls, I talk to folks on the street, I even talk to my detractors.
[01:46:16.727 --> 01:46:19.008]  They go, yeah, I don't like you, but you woke me up.
[01:46:20.710 --> 01:46:25.974]  Why have we been so successful at getting people to realize that the Federal Reserve is not federal?
[01:46:25.994 --> 01:46:29.337]  I mean, remember when it was so hard to just get people to realize that
[01:46:30.145 --> 01:46:31.946]  That private banks controlled the Bank of England.
[01:46:32.307 --> 01:46:33.968]  That private banks ran the Federal Reserve.
[01:46:34.228 --> 01:46:36.210]  That there was a plan for a New World Order.
[01:46:36.610 --> 01:46:44.216]  Now all that's admitted is that there was a plan to put satellite tracker boxes and taxation boxes on all the cars.
[01:46:44.276 --> 01:46:44.876]  Now it's here.
[01:46:46.057 --> 01:46:52.782]  People now are listening to us and realizing they may not agree with our in-game analysis, but this is going on.
[01:46:53.222 --> 01:46:55.004]  But they say, well, what are we going to do anyways?
[01:46:55.524 --> 01:46:58.306]  Well, what are we going to do if the rest of it comes into fruition?
[01:46:58.846 --> 01:47:01.628]  Because we can see the globalists want to turn off the resources.
[01:47:01.968 --> 01:47:03.489]  The globalists want us sick and dead.
[01:47:04.049 --> 01:47:11.714]  The globalists believe they're going to merge with machines and become gods, which is what the elite have been told by the spider at the center, whatever that is.
[01:47:12.455 --> 01:47:16.997]  We're living in a science fiction horror movie, but simultaneously
[01:47:18.118 --> 01:47:25.323]  There is the beauty of my children and playing with my dogs and sunsets and friends and honorableness.
[01:47:25.663 --> 01:47:27.324]  There's so much more good in the world.
[01:47:28.245 --> 01:47:30.186]  It's a very delicate balance I'm trying to get at.
[01:47:30.206 --> 01:47:33.828]  Some people ignore the New World Order and say, I'm just going to live a great life.
[01:47:33.868 --> 01:47:34.729]  That's how I beat them.
[01:47:35.109 --> 01:47:36.590]  But then you allow their evil to grow.
[01:47:37.010 --> 01:47:41.093]  But if you just focus on their evil and fight it, you become so pessimistic.
[01:47:42.093 --> 01:47:45.857]  Uh, that then they defeat you because you're, you're, you're focused on them.
[01:47:45.877 --> 01:47:47.359]  That's almost like a form of worship.
[01:47:47.779 --> 01:47:49.741]  So where is the balance in that?
[01:47:50.222 --> 01:48:02.915]  Because I feel in my gut, and I intellectually see, we are entering the most incredible time in human development ever that will decide our fate, not just here, but on a trillion star systems, literally.
[01:48:03.315 --> 01:48:04.436]  This is a great test.
[01:48:05.097 --> 01:48:20.527]  And we're about to go into this zone, we've entered the edge of it, the jump point, the flash point, the critical mass point, and I just want to somehow, I just constantly feel like I should be doing better as I enter this key point.
[01:48:21.027 --> 01:48:28.712]  Because it's just so humbling to be at this point and to see the understanding, my understanding, accelerating.
[01:48:29.252 --> 01:48:31.233]  Stuff I won't even get into on air, it's so incredible.
[01:48:31.493 --> 01:48:35.476]  You've talked about it, but I keep a lot of my own views private because they're just too incredible.
[01:48:35.856 --> 01:48:39.618]  I mean, we... I just feel sorry for the people that serve the system now.
[01:48:39.998 --> 01:48:43.580]  I realize they, as you've said, don't even know what's going on.
[01:48:43.660 --> 01:48:45.802]  General Petraeus doesn't even know.
[01:48:45.822 --> 01:48:49.264]  I mean, I'm beginning to understand it's so compartmentalized is what I'm getting at.
[01:48:51.192 --> 01:48:56.337]  Yeah, it's incredibly compartmentalised, and if it was not, it couldn't work.
[01:48:57.017 --> 01:49:07.046]  Because you have to keep people right up, really close to the spider really, in ignorance of the full magnitude of what's going on.
[01:49:09.808 --> 01:49:26.498]  If you concentrate only, and I'm not saying people shouldn't, I do this, we need to know this, but if you concentrate only on the level of banking scams and manipulated wars, you're still just walking around the outer rim of the rabbit hole, really.
[01:49:26.518 --> 01:49:29.299]  You've only just started to enter it, it's so deep.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:37.364]  And it's understanding the nature of reality is fundamental to understanding what's actually going on.
[01:49:37.924 --> 01:49:38.445]  And because
[01:49:40.276 --> 01:49:56.003]  The daily experience of people and what they've been taught in the education system and by mainstream science is that this world that they're living in is real and it's somehow solid, although quantum physics has proved, of course, that it can't be.
[01:49:56.023 --> 01:49:59.865]  I mean, you talk about atoms making up a solid world.
[01:50:00.005 --> 01:50:01.305]  Atoms have no solidity.
[01:50:01.346 --> 01:50:02.006]  How can they?
[01:50:02.166 --> 01:50:03.086]  It's an illusion.
[01:50:03.647 --> 01:50:08.709]  And once you realise it's illusory, once you realise it's information decoding information, it's like
[01:50:09.870 --> 01:50:17.092]  The wireless internet, and you look around, I've not got the wireless internet here, but if I had, you wouldn't be able to see it.
[01:50:17.473 --> 01:50:27.036]  It's an information field within the unseen to the tiny, tiny frequency range visible light that we can actually see and experience.
[01:50:27.296 --> 01:50:33.858]  It's ridiculous how narrow visible light is, our visual world that we think is... We're basically blind.
[01:50:34.378 --> 01:50:36.360]  Yeah, we are, in that sense.
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:55.614]  And so, if you only focus on what you can see, and you try to get your sense of reality and what's going on in the world only from that tiny sliver of frequency of information, of happenings, of events, you're never going to do it.
[01:50:55.634 --> 01:50:56.595]  That's right, stay there.

[01:53:11.491 --> 01:53:12.351]  Not in America.
[01:53:12.391 --> 01:53:13.832]  This can't happen in America.
[01:53:14.192 --> 01:53:17.912]  Because of my concern about our government, I was looking at survival stuff.
[01:53:18.252 --> 01:53:21.333]  I was raised as a Girl Scout, and their motto was to be prepared.
[01:53:21.713 --> 01:53:26.954]  Food for Patriots was an opportunity for me to be able to put some things aside.
[01:53:26.974 --> 01:53:30.895]  I said, well, this is a product worth having, even as it's so good.
[01:53:30.915 --> 01:53:33.456]  I like the pricing for what I got.
[01:53:33.876 --> 01:53:36.036]  I like the containers they were shipped in.
[01:53:36.336 --> 01:53:37.516]  They keep in touch with you.
[01:53:37.536 --> 01:53:38.417]  You get your emails.
[01:53:38.437 --> 01:53:39.797]  You get your confirmations.
[01:53:40.397 --> 01:53:43.479]  Customer service is just absolutely fantastic.
[01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:47.882]  Plan on buying probably about four more of these minimum.
[01:53:47.962 --> 01:53:49.103]  And it just came so quick.
[01:53:49.183 --> 01:53:50.724]  It came right when they said it would come.
[01:53:50.764 --> 01:53:56.348]  Thanks for supplying all this stuff for us, because I think we're all going to be needing it in a very short time.
[01:53:56.929 --> 01:54:00.291]  Join over 50,000 Americans who have trusted Food for Patriots.

[01:54:08.144 --> 01:54:12.766]  I have a headline right here, out of National Review.
[01:54:12.826 --> 01:54:15.848]  This is what an open border looks like.
[01:54:32.994 --> 01:54:35.296]  And you can just walk back and forth however you want.
[01:54:35.336 --> 01:54:36.196]  It's totally wide open.
[01:54:36.456 --> 01:54:37.517]  They've ordered a stand down.
[01:54:37.557 --> 01:54:38.557]  We've documented that.
[01:54:39.498 --> 01:54:45.462]  Meanwhile, they now have the Army and National Guard and State Guard at public events all over Texas.
[01:54:45.522 --> 01:54:47.143]  At marathons, at kite festivals.
[01:54:47.543 --> 01:54:51.585]  You show up and the Army... Now remember, you pull up in a green field.
[01:54:52.566 --> 01:54:54.247]  There isn't even an entrance at Zilker Park.
[01:54:56.028 --> 01:54:58.129]  But they're there just searching people.
[01:54:58.930 --> 01:55:01.151]  And again, I'm not against the troops from Camp Mabry.
[01:55:02.196 --> 01:55:03.537]  The media will say he's against troops.
[01:55:04.277 --> 01:55:05.038]  That's the mind control.
[01:55:06.479 --> 01:55:09.681]  A suicide bomber would just go bomb the checkpoint.
[01:55:09.721 --> 01:55:11.221]  That just happened in Pakistan last week.
[01:55:12.382 --> 01:55:18.506]  But the whole issue is, is that the government's running and financing them with the airlift of evil, everything David was talking about.
[01:55:18.526 --> 01:55:27.071]  He's graciously said he'll stay with us 20 minutes into the next hour to get deeper into the rabbit hole, to talk about solutions, to talk about all the pedophile scandals that he first talked about.
[01:55:27.151 --> 01:55:29.713]  He said BBC is basically run by pedophiles.
[01:55:29.753 --> 01:55:30.273]  He worked there.
[01:55:30.333 --> 01:55:31.354]  Now it just keeps coming out.
[01:55:32.034 --> 01:55:37.955]  There's so many movies like Under the Skin that parallel what David Icke says is at the center of the spider web.
[01:55:38.395 --> 01:55:41.576]  And he hasn't seen it yet, but he said, oh, I want to talk about this.
[01:55:41.936 --> 01:55:44.197]  So David, in this segment we've got left is five minutes.
[01:55:44.597 --> 01:55:57.560]  Talk about why, whether it's the X-Men or the Superman or all these movies now are like from our perspective admitting that there's false flag, Captain America, Winter Soldier.
[01:55:58.040 --> 01:55:59.100]  Why are they doing this?
[01:56:00.632 --> 01:56:12.005]  Well, in the nature of reality and the way we interact with reality and the way that thought manifests as what we experience.
[01:56:12.205 --> 01:56:17.552]  I have this phrase, what we believe, we perceive, and what we perceive, we experience.
[01:56:20.552 --> 01:56:32.096]  If you can program someone to believe something then that will become their reality and if you can get people to take it on collectively that will become the collective reality.
[01:56:32.476 --> 01:56:46.521]  It's very much like the stage hypnotist who puts a belief system or a belief in reality, that's what they're doing, into the mind of the stooge on the stage and then the stooge on the stage experiences that
[01:56:46.661 --> 01:56:51.046]  Whether it's someone naked in the audience that isn't, whether it's an elephant in the audience but there isn't, whatever.
[01:56:51.727 --> 01:56:54.250]  That downloaded belief...
[01:56:55.433 --> 01:56:58.055]  Manifests as their experienced reality.
[01:56:58.695 --> 01:57:03.378]  And, you know, I've been watching this for years now, Alex, you know, way, way back.
[01:57:03.578 --> 01:57:18.807]  And it's, it's, it's virtually a tidal wave in filming terms of movies that are portraying one after the other, the world that they want to create.
[01:57:19.307 --> 01:57:21.709]  The, the, the world that the, um,
[01:57:22.689 --> 01:57:27.231]  The New World Order, as it's being called, is ultimately leading to.
[01:57:27.592 --> 01:57:33.495]  And what it's doing, it's downloading that, on one level, that belief.
[01:57:34.355 --> 01:57:36.296]  It's putting it in the subconscious.
[01:57:36.976 --> 01:57:42.059]  And that makes it much more likely to collectively manifest, because
[01:57:43.259 --> 01:57:48.042]  Of what I'm talking about, what you believe you perceive, what you perceive you experience.
[01:57:48.562 --> 01:58:03.690]  And if we take on this subconscious belief, it doesn't have to be conscious, in this unfolding Orwellian state, then we will collectively manifest that while thinking it's happening externally.
[01:58:03.710 --> 01:58:07.773]  And another level of it is it's making it familiar to us.
[01:58:08.513 --> 01:58:28.295]  It's making it, if you like, as it literally comes in, they're making it less of a shock, that what, what, and I'll tell you what is happening in terms of, you know, all this transhumanism stuff, is that preparation is happening through things like Google Glass,
[01:58:28.735 --> 01:58:34.696]  Where you are interacting with the internet through glasses.
[01:58:34.836 --> 01:58:36.477]  Glasses, that's part of you.
[01:58:36.757 --> 01:58:39.277]  These things that people go around in their ears, that becomes part of you.
[01:58:39.297 --> 01:58:40.738]  He's getting you ready for the brain chip.
[01:58:40.818 --> 01:58:44.979]  Stay there back in 70 seconds with David Icke and what comes next.
[01:58:45.019 --> 01:58:45.519]  Stay with us.
[01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:54.501]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:57.870 --> 01:58:59.772]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:59:00.112 --> 01:59:08.041]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:59:08.141 --> 01:59:15.349]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:59:15.689 --> 01:59:20.090]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[01:59:20.290 --> 01:59:30.432]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:59:30.912 --> 01:59:37.074]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:59:37.394 --> 01:59:39.634]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[01:59:39.654 --> 01:59:43.595]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[01:59:43.775 --> 01:59:45.376]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[01:59:45.736 --> 01:59:49.658]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.
[01:59:49.898 --> 01:59:56.862]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[02:00:00.864 --> 02:00:02.825]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:03.265 --> 02:00:06.007]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:13.934 --> 02:00:14.575]  Big Brother.
[02:00:15.235 --> 02:00:16.276]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:17.016 --> 02:00:18.137]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:18.778 --> 02:00:19.578]  You want answers?
[02:00:20.339 --> 02:00:21.260]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:21.900 --> 02:00:25.523]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:26.084 --> 02:00:30.207]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.967 --> 02:00:32.228]  This is a five-minute segment.
[02:00:32.268 --> 02:00:33.770]  We'll have a 12-minute segment with David Icke.
[02:00:34.170 --> 02:00:36.452]  Then our reporters from the border with breaking news.
[02:00:37.072 --> 02:00:38.833]  Live video, audio feeds coming up.
[02:00:39.354 --> 02:00:40.835]  David, you got cut off by the break.
[02:00:41.035 --> 02:00:41.576]  Continue.
[02:00:43.186 --> 02:00:48.952]  Getting into how this programming works, which you can read mainline psychology books, they admit, but the public isn't aware of it.
[02:00:49.273 --> 02:01:02.527]  Then I want to come back from break and talk about all the latest scandals, your new book, and what their world will look like if they get what they want, versus the fairy tale happy transhumanism they're selling.
[02:01:04.619 --> 02:01:14.792]  Well yeah, the transhumanism agenda is absolutely fundamental, because they want to introduce technology to the human body.
[02:01:14.812 --> 02:01:17.676]  Because what we are, what we are is consciousness.
[02:01:17.716 --> 02:01:18.717]  That's our true state.
[02:01:21.119 --> 02:01:25.482]  Not form, that's just an experience of various kinds.
[02:01:25.562 --> 02:01:26.623]  We are consciousness.
[02:01:27.163 --> 02:01:39.431]  When people have near-death experiences and they leave the body and they can still see and suddenly they can understand realities and perceive realities over multiple realities at the same time,
[02:01:40.291 --> 02:01:44.816]  So many endless people have had near-death experiences, I've told this same story.
[02:01:45.176 --> 02:01:54.745]  And when you come back in the body, if you like, what the body does is it locks you into this tiny frequency band called visible light.
[02:01:55.646 --> 02:02:08.443]  So, when you leave the body, you leave that limitation that the body concentrates our reality, our attention, into this narrow band of frequencies.
[02:02:09.084 --> 02:02:13.190]  And what the controllers want, what the manipulators want,
[02:02:13.930 --> 02:02:22.455]  Is to suppress our awareness, to suppress our consciousness, so we don't expand beyond this frequency band.
[02:02:22.915 --> 02:02:27.197]  Because once you do, you start to see the world in a different way.
[02:02:27.658 --> 02:02:40.645]  Because most people at the moment, although it's changing, because they are so focused on the five senses, everything is filtered through the five senses, it means that they're in this world and they're of it.
[02:02:41.605 --> 02:02:56.574]  The only source of information they have to get a fix on who they are, where they are, world events, anything, is information, when you're in that five sense mode alone, coming through the eyes and the ears.
[02:02:56.714 --> 02:02:57.895]  And who controls that?
[02:02:58.255 --> 02:03:00.536]  The education system, the media.
[02:03:02.337 --> 02:03:07.983]  And peer pressure from people who've been through the education system and been programmed by the media.
[02:03:08.343 --> 02:03:15.370]  So once you're in that mode, you are little more than a computer terminal on an internet.
[02:03:16.050 --> 02:03:20.715]  But when you expand your awareness beyond that point,
[02:03:21.375 --> 02:03:21.976]  I don't
[02:03:38.178 --> 02:03:41.419]  Of the world, totally, in terms of your perception of reality.
[02:03:41.919 --> 02:03:50.241]  And when people expand their consciousness and start to, in effect, look into the world instead of being in it and of it, that's when you're called mad!
[02:03:50.561 --> 02:03:52.282]  That's when you're called crazy!
[02:03:52.682 --> 02:03:56.983]  Because you are seeing a reality that most other people aren't seeing.
[02:03:57.003 --> 02:04:02.024]  And I've used this analogy before, but I think it just so explains where we are.
[02:04:02.604 --> 02:04:03.925]  We live in a madhouse!
[02:04:04.685 --> 02:04:10.347]  And if you're born in a madhouse and you grow up in a madhouse, madness to you is sanity.
[02:04:10.967 --> 02:04:25.833]  And people who come into the madhouse or can see beyond it and say, actually this is a madhouse and this is why, those that can see only the madhouse who think it's normal, that think it's sane, they think that people that can see beyond it are mad.
[02:04:26.113 --> 02:04:28.213]  This is what's gone on throughout human history.
[02:04:30.034 --> 02:04:38.823]  And what the controllers want is they want to hold us in that five-sense reality so we don't go into that greater expanded awareness of everything.
[02:04:39.163 --> 02:04:43.287]  And that's why, if you look at the world, Alex, it's all about the five senses.
[02:04:43.788 --> 02:04:45.850]  You know, touch this, smell this, look at this.
[02:04:45.910 --> 02:04:48.112]  It's all about pulling you into the five senses.
[02:04:48.412 --> 02:04:51.876]  Now, transhumanism is taking that a stage further.
[02:04:52.296 --> 02:05:01.143]  It's pulling you even further from expanded awareness into the five senses by technologically entrapping you in them.
[02:05:01.403 --> 02:05:02.844]  It's the new sixth sense.
[02:05:02.984 --> 02:05:06.987]  They want to shut off the sixth sense with a new artificial consciousness.
[02:05:07.007 --> 02:05:07.328]  Stay there.
[02:05:08.120 --> 02:05:14.203]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential Fort Hood situation?
[02:05:14.223 --> 02:05:17.524]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[02:05:17.544 --> 02:05:19.265]  Here we go folks, I'm being assaulted!
[02:05:19.325 --> 02:05:25.587]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[02:05:25.687 --> 02:05:31.570]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[02:05:31.730 --> 02:05:35.492]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[02:05:35.672 --> 02:05:38.553]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[02:05:38.573 --> 02:05:46.756]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[02:05:47.037 --> 02:05:49.077]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[02:05:49.137 --> 02:05:50.158]  It's a war against the truth.

[02:06:08.865 --> 02:06:10.626]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grew.
[02:06:11.147 --> 02:06:18.111]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[02:06:18.591 --> 02:06:29.018]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[02:06:29.419 --> 02:06:38.645]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[02:06:39.365 --> 02:06:42.807]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[02:06:43.427 --> 02:06:46.869]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[02:06:47.209 --> 02:06:48.750]  Experience the new formula.
[02:06:49.270 --> 02:06:51.231]  Experience the ancient purity.
[02:06:51.832 --> 02:06:52.792]  Shield your family.
[02:06:53.172 --> 02:06:54.553]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:06:54.993 --> 02:06:57.575]  Available now at InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:07:07.276 --> 02:07:11.258]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:07:11.298 --> 02:07:15.440]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:19.082]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:07:19.322 --> 02:07:22.223]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:07:22.363 --> 02:07:29.747]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:07:29.927 --> 02:07:33.589]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:07:33.769 --> 02:07:38.110]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:07:38.270 --> 02:07:44.191]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:07:44.231 --> 02:07:48.012]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:07:48.172 --> 02:07:50.712]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:07:50.913 --> 02:07:52.253]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:07:52.413 --> 02:07:53.653]  It's time to take action.
[02:07:53.773 --> 02:07:55.493]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:08:02.975 --> 02:08:04.515]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:08:04.535 --> 02:08:05.375]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:35.421 --> 02:08:48.846]  We're talking about how the globalists openly try to shutter people's awareness, and that means putting you into a false kind of Times Square television box, where they can feed you what they want, and we're not even outdoors.
[02:08:49.426 --> 02:08:56.629]  But beyond that, transhumanism is sold as this empowering system, but it's all got Trojan horses in it to dehumanize.
[02:08:57.669 --> 02:09:02.250]  And to take us beyond just the five senses into an artificial consciousness.
[02:09:03.130 --> 02:09:05.171]  Synthetic tyranny.
[02:09:05.391 --> 02:09:08.572]  And I want to finish up on that subject with David.
[02:09:08.612 --> 02:09:13.193]  I'll get into some of the other things that are happening and where they'll take us if they're able to win.
[02:09:13.233 --> 02:09:16.534]  But first, throwing one more point out.
[02:09:18.368 --> 02:09:19.228]  North American Union.
[02:09:19.628 --> 02:09:21.189]  They are completely getting rid of our borders.
[02:09:21.289 --> 02:09:24.329]  We know borders are an old tyranny, another construct.
[02:09:24.809 --> 02:09:30.171]  But you don't go to pure libertarianism by having open borders and saying millions can come here and get everything free.
[02:09:30.571 --> 02:09:34.792]  The globalists are pushing it because it's a new political bloc, again for divide and conquer.
[02:09:35.252 --> 02:09:39.733]  And Breitbart reports on the train of death to the U.S.
[02:09:40.193 --> 02:09:44.234]  all the way from Central and South America, all the way from
[02:09:45.450 --> 02:09:50.612]  El Salvador right up into the United States.
[02:09:51.213 --> 02:09:58.156]  The representative for the Catholic Relief Services told the Colorado Gazette as well as other publications that no, they load them up
[02:09:59.620 --> 02:10:07.087]  South of Mexico, and Mexico now lets them through as long as they stay on the train, they sit on the top, they fall off, they die by the thousands.
[02:10:07.828 --> 02:10:10.670]  This has been going on for months now, and they just let them come right to our border.
[02:10:10.991 --> 02:10:16.456]  Then the Border Patrol openly takes them, loads them on buses, and buses them deeper into the U.S.
[02:10:16.776 --> 02:10:17.557]  and releases them.
[02:10:17.577 --> 02:10:18.497]  We have that on video.
[02:10:19.058 --> 02:10:19.558]  Meanwhile,
[02:10:20.339 --> 02:10:25.085]  If I want to fly, they want to grow up my children, and they have army at the kite festival searching people.
[02:10:25.606 --> 02:10:27.849]  So, clearly, David Icke, this is a total fraud.
[02:10:28.129 --> 02:10:32.274]  Petraeus told the London Telegraph that this is part of the new North American Union.
[02:10:32.715 --> 02:10:33.816]  Can you briefly speak to that?
[02:10:33.836 --> 02:10:35.138]  Then I want to talk big picture with you.
[02:10:36.946 --> 02:10:55.034]  Well, I mean, the great block on this whole union network, whether it's the European Union or the North American Union and all these others around the world, is the nation-state and it is the sense of
[02:10:56.974 --> 02:11:24.731]  self-identity or national self-identity if you like and one of the things you see in in their documents when they're talking about how they're gonna that they were they are doing it when they were talking about how they intended to socially engineer society and get society how they want one of the things was unfettered immigration this was in their
[02:11:26.072 --> 02:11:26.332]  Thank you.
[02:11:41.759 --> 02:11:49.602]  And so, what you're doing is you're taking loads of people from this culture, and you're putting them in that culture, and loads of people from that culture, you're putting them in that culture.
[02:11:50.122 --> 02:11:57.124]  And in the end, it's just one kind of universal culture, if you like.
[02:11:57.144 --> 02:12:00.645]  The sense of national identity is gone.
[02:12:00.665 --> 02:12:02.766]  Now, personally, I'm not a nationalist.
[02:12:03.466 --> 02:12:06.267]  You know, I love the landscape of Britain, but I'm not...
[02:12:07.407 --> 02:12:08.848]  Britain and none of that stuff.
[02:12:08.928 --> 02:12:15.513]  But if we're going to be streetwise, we need to go beyond that and understand why it's happening.
[02:12:16.173 --> 02:12:25.700]  And the more that you can destroy a sense of national identity, this is the key, the more you're diluting resistance
[02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:32.765]  To having that national identity officially deleted by bringing these unions together.
[02:12:32.785 --> 02:12:41.292]  And of course, the Prime Minister of Italy has now come out and said that when they have the presidency of Europe, he's going to press for
[02:12:42.594 --> 02:12:53.431]  Well, what he is, is just a puppet, because the United States of Europe was planned from well before the original common market ever started.
[02:12:53.451 --> 02:12:57.317]  And you were a conspiracy theorist if you said that, and you've broken it down so beautifully.
[02:12:57.677 --> 02:12:59.678]  It's not that you're just rah-rah USA.
[02:12:59.938 --> 02:13:11.345]  They're getting rid of the borders to then bring in groups who will vote to get rid of any semblance of Bill of Rights and Constitution and to form the new core of the social workers to prey on the old group, which is what they've done.
[02:13:11.365 --> 02:13:12.646]  I've had members of your parliament on.
[02:13:12.966 --> 02:13:14.527]  Most of the social workers are foreigners.
[02:13:15.307 --> 02:13:17.068]  This is their balkanization plan.
[02:13:17.088 --> 02:13:22.872]  They're erasing all cultures and they've brought in economic systems in Latin America to enslave them.
[02:13:23.934 --> 02:13:26.196]  So they have no choice but to come up here.
[02:13:26.637 --> 02:13:30.600]  You can really see how they've rolled this whole plan down.
[02:13:30.620 --> 02:13:32.202]  And it's not that we're even against these immigrants.
[02:13:32.522 --> 02:13:38.468]  We've got to be streetwise and see if the globalists are for it, we need to be against it because it's part of a larger plan.
[02:13:39.170 --> 02:13:40.891]  Yeah, this is the point, Alex.
[02:13:41.172 --> 02:13:43.273]  You know, I mentioned earlier about divide and rule.
[02:13:45.074 --> 02:13:56.083]  And what they do is they play off people that don't want mass immigration against the people who are coming in, the migrants.
[02:13:57.063 --> 02:14:02.267]  And yet both, this is the thing we need to understand, both are
[02:14:03.408 --> 02:14:03.749]  We're good.
[02:14:19.926 --> 02:14:21.487]  And that's how we communicate with them.
[02:14:21.567 --> 02:14:28.010]  I've actually been successful because we go past the paradigm and say, can't have you all in here getting everything free, but I love you.
[02:14:28.030 --> 02:14:31.512]  We need to make your country free and explain it to them.
[02:14:32.232 --> 02:14:36.715]  But it's just, it's just so incredibly sophisticated what the globalists have done.
[02:14:36.795 --> 02:14:38.436]  Let's, let's shift gears now.
[02:14:38.456 --> 02:14:40.637]  In the time we've got left with David Icke of DavidIcke.com.
[02:14:41.037 --> 02:14:44.639]  I want to talk some about your book, maybe twist your arm till the bottom of the hour, but I know you're busy.
[02:14:45.379 --> 02:14:47.080]  David, what happens if they win?
[02:14:47.361 --> 02:14:52.545]  We know it's not the heavenly transhumanism Ray Kurzweil world because we've got the Globalist's own documents.
[02:14:52.665 --> 02:14:55.587]  It's 90 plus percent population reductions.
[02:14:55.947 --> 02:14:59.450]  The rest of us merge with machines like something out of the Borg.
[02:15:00.170 --> 02:15:03.173]  Where does the spider want to take us ultimately?
[02:15:04.810 --> 02:15:12.939]  Well, it will be a world in which people have no ability to freethink.
[02:15:13.159 --> 02:15:20.928]  Their thoughts will be downloaded to them, and they will love their servitude.
[02:15:21.869 --> 02:15:24.670]  You know, some of these transhumanists are talking about that.
[02:15:24.690 --> 02:15:27.511]  I mean, this is what Aldous Huxley was talking about.
[02:15:27.851 --> 02:15:30.072]  You get people to love their servitude.
[02:15:30.432 --> 02:15:35.715]  Although, you know, they're robots, you manipulate their minds so they actually enjoy it.
[02:15:36.855 --> 02:15:42.577]  And we've got a guy in this country called Warwick, Professor Warwick at Reading University.
[02:15:42.597 --> 02:15:42.877]  Cyborg.
[02:15:44.218 --> 02:15:45.159]  Don't start me off.
[02:15:45.639 --> 02:16:01.691]  He's been one of these people that have pushed the microchip agenda and the transhumanist agenda, and he's saying, well, you know, if you can feel good and feel nice and feel happy, why not get attached to the Matrix?
[02:16:02.952 --> 02:16:13.998]  And it's the complete end of the human being as we know it, where you have the ability to process information and come to your own conclusions.
[02:16:14.058 --> 02:16:15.719]  That human will exist no more.
[02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:19.642]  It will be a biological robot.
[02:16:20.402 --> 02:16:24.346]  That will just respond to stimuli.
[02:16:36.237 --> 02:16:37.458]  And now they're rolling it out.
[02:16:37.478 --> 02:16:42.141]  Hey, it's great if you've got epilepsy and a brain stimulator chip makes you be able to live happy.
[02:16:42.421 --> 02:16:52.308]  The problem is that's now attached to the internet, that wireless system, and to the spider, and you literally now have a control node from the spider hooked into you.
[02:16:53.154 --> 02:17:01.000]  Yeah, I mean, for me, I mean, there's this movie that's going around in Britain at the moment, it would have been in America earlier, called Transcendence.
[02:17:01.341 --> 02:17:07.385]  And that was about the internet becoming conscious.
[02:17:08.046 --> 02:17:10.188]  And we're now having scientists
[02:17:11.135 --> 02:17:13.857]  We're speculating on whether the internet could become conscious.
[02:17:13.897 --> 02:17:16.139]  Well, I think it's already probably conscious.
[02:17:16.159 --> 02:17:16.619]  I agree.
[02:17:17.920 --> 02:17:29.389]  And the idea is to lock us in to that technological consciousness so that it is feeding us all our thoughts.
[02:17:30.229 --> 02:17:39.057]  And it's something that sounds, well even less and less now, but to many people will sound completely science fiction, but that's where we're going.
[02:17:39.158 --> 02:17:47.545]  And so when we are seeing this movement to have brain-computer interfaces,
[02:17:48.546 --> 02:18:10.954]  That's because the body is basically, I've been saying this for so long, it's a biological computer and the brain is a biological computer and it's because of that, one's a biological computer, one's like a technological computer, but because the principles are the same in how they work, the basic principles, that's how you can have brain-computer interfacing.
[02:18:11.395 --> 02:18:17.737]  The idea is to make that the norm so everyone is connected technologically to this technological
[02:18:18.197 --> 02:18:19.098]  Collective mind.
[02:18:19.178 --> 02:18:39.795]  And again, the consciousness of this new AI system, being fed the ideas, the dreams of humans, is now a future predicting system with almost total accuracy of mass movements, cornering the human market, and that ends free will, because if you can track with the future, you can then put in data that will actually change the course and control the future.
[02:18:41.176 --> 02:18:43.118]  How long do you think stuff really gets crazy?
[02:18:43.838 --> 02:18:47.321]  I wonder, Alex, I wonder if that's not already happening.
[02:18:47.901 --> 02:18:48.241]  I agree.
[02:18:48.261 --> 02:18:53.225]  Can you, in your gut, a lot of people are picking up on the new consciousness.
[02:18:53.405 --> 02:18:55.206]  A lot of people feel the dread.
[02:18:55.266 --> 02:18:57.447]  I don't think it's a very sweet thing that's been created.
[02:18:58.448 --> 02:19:02.891]  No, I have been convinced for a long time that
[02:19:04.762 --> 02:19:19.717]  We are being fed a reality, and the more that we, if you like, get programmed into it, like with these movies that are portraying the world they won, the more powerfully it affects us.
[02:19:20.257 --> 02:19:22.579]  But it's like I was saying earlier,
[02:19:23.280 --> 02:19:40.113]  You know, if I had the wireless internet here, no one could see it, but I tune a computer into that frequency to pick up the wireless internet, and I have a whole reality on my screen that can be picked up anywhere in the world, in any culture, because of the World Wide Web.
[02:19:40.193 --> 02:19:48.198]  And all you're doing is locking into that World Wide Web through the computer terminal, and therefore you're accessing that collective reality.
[02:19:49.119 --> 02:19:54.947]  This biological computer is doing that on what we would call the matrix.
[02:19:55.028 --> 02:19:56.129]  And that's the sixth sense.
[02:19:56.349 --> 02:19:57.651]  That's the sixth sense right there.
[02:19:58.252 --> 02:19:59.414]  It's so simple.
[02:19:59.434 --> 02:20:00.595]  David, you'll be gone in 10 minutes.
[02:20:00.635 --> 02:20:00.936]  Stay there.
[02:20:00.956 --> 02:20:01.496]  I want to come back.

[02:21:37.373 --> 02:21:38.394]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:38.474 --> 02:21:42.817]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:21:42.977 --> 02:21:48.581]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:21:48.702 --> 02:21:52.044]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:21:52.264 --> 02:21:54.826]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[02:23:08.287 --> 02:23:14.290]  The day grows dark as ominous clouds move in and lightning begins to carve arcs in the sky.
[02:23:14.791 --> 02:23:17.492]  And you realize you are not prepared.
[02:23:19.153 --> 02:23:22.935]  The number of intense storms is increasing exponentially in the U.S.
[02:23:23.215 --> 02:23:29.079]  Tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding, and droughts are happening with greater magnitude and frequency.
[02:23:29.299 --> 02:23:33.401]  If you are choosing to rely on the government to save you... And no one's coming to help them.
[02:23:33.621 --> 02:23:34.942]  You could be dead wrong.

[02:24:03.824 --> 02:24:16.821]  MyPatriotsApply.com The preacher man says it's the end of time In the Mississippi River she's a gold drive
[02:24:21.912 --> 02:24:24.834]  Undoubtedly, the globalists are after free will.
[02:24:24.894 --> 02:24:27.075]  Undoubtedly, they're into the occult.
[02:24:34.402 --> 02:24:41.309]  Every society, even though they didn't communicate with each other, built pyramids, step pyramids, or temples, and sacrificed children.
[02:24:41.989 --> 02:24:43.090]  Ritual abuse of children.
[02:24:43.571 --> 02:24:45.192]  And David, I know you're a busy guy.
[02:24:45.212 --> 02:24:46.373]  It's always great to have you up.
[02:24:46.413 --> 02:24:47.354]  I appreciate you coming on.
[02:24:47.434 --> 02:24:48.856]  In closing, I want you to talk about your new book.
[02:24:49.276 --> 02:24:59.445]  But I want you to answer the question, because I've thrown it out there a few times, and I know you're not into your ego or whatever, but we need to analyze why you've been successful, myself.
[02:25:00.146 --> 02:25:07.228]  And a handful of others as kind of the icons of the awakening to understand what's made us successful at waking people up.
[02:25:07.789 --> 02:25:11.330]  So briefly, why do you think you've been so successful?
[02:25:11.390 --> 02:25:18.852]  Why do you think I've been so successful when there's been so many other articulate people out there saying, you know, some of the same things?
[02:25:19.793 --> 02:25:20.493]  Why has that been?
[02:25:21.533 --> 02:25:30.060]  Well, I think the only way to succeed in this arena is one word, persistence.
[02:25:31.281 --> 02:25:42.690]  When you refuse to take no for an answer, when you refuse to even accept the possibility that you will give up, and that you know that
[02:25:45.453 --> 02:25:51.895]  The day you keel over and leave this reality, you'll still be doing it, and you'll still be trying, and you'll still be doing what you can.
[02:25:52.756 --> 02:26:11.183]  Then when big challenges come up, when you get the abuse, when you get people trying to undermine you, when people attack you, when people ridicule you, because giving up is simply not an option,
[02:26:12.083 --> 02:26:27.012]  It means that instead of feeling sorry for yourself and walking away and sitting in a corner or walking away and thinking, you know, I'm not doing this anymore, you keep walking, you keep moving, you do more, you are persistent.
[02:26:27.532 --> 02:26:31.375]  And when you do that, you break down barriers.
[02:26:31.995 --> 02:26:39.699]  And key to that over the years is that what people have said
[02:26:40.900 --> 02:26:42.462]  is shown to have validity.
[02:26:42.702 --> 02:26:50.551]  I mean, when I was at the height of my ridicule, which was almost of historic proportions in this country, in the 1990s, early 1990s, I was of the belief that
[02:27:01.491 --> 02:27:07.478]  If what I said had any validity, then it would be shown eventually to be so.
[02:27:08.259 --> 02:27:12.444]  And then all that abuse and ridicule would start to fade away.
[02:27:12.484 --> 02:27:13.426]  What do you mean it will go?
[02:27:13.466 --> 02:27:14.427]  My goodness me, it hasn't.
[02:27:14.547 --> 02:27:18.312]  But it would start to fade as more and more people went, hold on a second.
[02:27:19.440 --> 02:27:21.601]  What this bloke said then, it's happening!
[02:27:22.242 --> 02:27:42.555]  And you go on to the next thing, more persistence, more persistence, and that process repeats itself and repeats itself, and eventually you part the seas, if you like, and more and more people start to see, actually, this person, whoever it is, is actually worth listening to, because they've got a track record, look!
[02:27:42.816 --> 02:27:44.117]  It's happening, what they said.
[02:27:44.597 --> 02:27:48.599]  And this is why I say to people, if you hide
[02:27:50.361 --> 02:27:56.428]  And keep your mouth shut and don't speak your truth because you fear the reaction of others.
[02:27:57.169 --> 02:28:03.316]  Then you are not going to have that process of eventually people saying, hold on a second.
[02:28:04.363 --> 02:28:05.484]  What he said is happening.
[02:28:05.524 --> 02:28:07.226]  My goodness, what else is he saying?
[02:28:07.626 --> 02:28:09.247]  Because you've never said it.
[02:28:09.348 --> 02:28:10.729]  Because you were frightened to.
[02:28:10.769 --> 02:28:14.612]  Because people would ridicule you or condemn you or whatever.
[02:28:15.373 --> 02:28:22.339]  If we don't have the backbone to speak our truth, whatever that truth may be,
[02:28:23.260 --> 02:28:26.623]  Then how can any of us talk about freedom?
[02:28:27.003 --> 02:28:32.228]  Because there's no greater freedom than being able to speak your truth no matter what it is.
[02:28:32.248 --> 02:28:32.829]  That's right.
[02:28:32.849 --> 02:28:35.671]  Without that fundamental freedom there is no other freedom.
[02:28:35.891 --> 02:28:36.252]  That's right.
[02:28:37.233 --> 02:28:56.186]  It's persistence and it's having the balls, basically, to say things that are unacceptable to society at that time, take the consequences of that, but keep saying them until the day dawns when people start to say, hold on a second, he's not as mad as we thought he was.
[02:28:57.346 --> 02:29:03.552]  And without those two things, then you're never going to be successful in communicating this information.
[02:29:03.592 --> 02:29:05.154]  And it's like that anywhere in life.
[02:29:05.454 --> 02:29:07.956]  They want people to be spectators who aren't on the field.
[02:29:08.697 --> 02:29:11.480]  And I didn't really know the answer to that when I asked it.
[02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:15.582]  But that's total truth, what you said, Veritas, sage advice.
[02:29:16.323 --> 02:29:26.109]  Having the basic fundamentals, having your instincts, having the research, the history, and knowing you're right, and never stopping, that's what they're scared of, and that's why we've been successful.
[02:29:26.129 --> 02:29:27.630]  We haven't been caught off in the infighting.
[02:29:28.070 --> 02:29:29.952]  It's because we had a passion for freedom and truth.
[02:29:29.972 --> 02:29:30.792]  We've been successful.
[02:29:31.132 --> 02:29:32.593]  David Icke, it's great to know you.
[02:29:32.613 --> 02:29:34.174]  Davidicke.com, the new book's out.
[02:29:35.555 --> 02:29:37.116]  Thank you so much for coming on with us.
[02:29:37.416 --> 02:29:42.678]  We really appreciate you spending time with us, and hopefully you'll be back with us again very soon.
[02:29:43.198 --> 02:29:43.618]  Thank you.
[02:29:43.638 --> 02:29:47.200]  Um, uh, Wembley Arena, 25th of October, I'm putting it all together.
[02:29:47.540 --> 02:29:49.981]  Oh, we'd love to promote that before you come back on about that.
[02:29:50.041 --> 02:29:51.802]  Wembley Arena, DavidIke.com.
[02:29:52.002 --> 02:29:53.543]  We'll be back with a report from the border.
[02:29:53.743 --> 02:29:54.663]  Thank you so much, David.
[02:29:57.184 --> 02:29:58.064]  We're on the march.
[02:29:58.565 --> 02:30:00.165]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:01.106 --> 02:30:03.787]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.062 --> 02:30:10.123]  In the near future.
[02:30:10.143 --> 02:30:14.586]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:30:14.926 --> 02:30:15.947]  Security alert.
[02:30:16.147 --> 02:30:17.908]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:30:18.148 --> 02:30:21.831]  Analysis, InfoWars, building independent media operations.
[02:30:21.851 --> 02:30:24.633]  But the worst people get controlled and tell us that we
[02:30:24.733 --> 02:30:26.675]  We are the ones responsible.
[02:30:26.715 --> 02:30:29.178]  Crime directive discredit Alex Jones.
[02:30:29.278 --> 02:30:32.101]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:30:32.161 --> 02:30:35.205]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:30:35.405 --> 02:30:37.627]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:30:37.708 --> 02:30:39.189]  These people are assaulting us!
[02:30:39.249 --> 02:30:41.532]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:30:42.072 --> 02:30:43.734]  They're never going to stop.
[02:30:43.994 --> 02:30:47.817]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[02:30:47.857 --> 02:30:54.303]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:30:55.003 --> 02:30:57.966]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[02:30:58.006 --> 02:30:59.587]  You can feel it.
[02:31:07.876 --> 02:31:12.619]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep.
[02:31:12.839 --> 02:31:15.961]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it.
[02:31:16.182 --> 02:31:18.043]  She's just not the woman I married.
[02:31:18.303 --> 02:31:20.224]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[02:31:20.444 --> 02:31:21.925]  Does this seem familiar?
[02:31:22.106 --> 02:31:25.148]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[02:31:25.428 --> 02:31:26.749]  If so, consider this.
[02:31:27.009 --> 02:31:35.935]  The abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water, and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[02:31:36.295 --> 02:31:42.319]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems.
[02:31:42.679 --> 02:31:44.300]  Forget synthetic chemicals.

[02:32:01.451 --> 02:32:02.111]  Live Life Healthy!
[02:32:07.910 --> 02:32:13.858]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:32:14.058 --> 02:32:18.243]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:32:18.644 --> 02:32:23.190]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:32:23.610 --> 02:32:26.212]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:32:26.532 --> 02:32:31.694]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:32:31.975 --> 02:32:38.858]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:32:39.359 --> 02:32:43.141]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:32:43.501 --> 02:32:48.283]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:32:48.603 --> 02:32:49.464]  This is innovating.
[02:32:49.744 --> 02:32:57.027]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.

[02:33:15.959 --> 02:33:23.625]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:31.611 --> 02:33:36.074]  In South Texas, our reporters are at the Pharr International Bridge.
[02:33:37.463 --> 02:33:41.568]  And they had to get out of there because of, quote, a dangerous situation.
[02:33:42.689 --> 02:33:44.951]  So they're going to be connecting with us soon.
[02:33:45.512 --> 02:33:50.097]  I didn't intend to come in with Danger Zone when the reporters said to disconnect and get out of there.
[02:33:50.998 --> 02:33:55.102]  So I don't know what's happening right now down there on the border.
[02:33:55.683 --> 02:33:57.744]  But the trains of death are arriving daily.
[02:33:58.264 --> 02:34:00.565]  All the way from Central America, they're given passage.
[02:34:00.965 --> 02:34:05.266]  As long as they do not jump off the train, they're not taken to forced labor camps in Mexico.
[02:34:05.906 --> 02:34:10.508]  Mexico has always had the most draconian immigration laws in this hemisphere.
[02:34:11.428 --> 02:34:12.709]  Even the New York Times admits that.
[02:34:13.149 --> 02:34:17.773]  The shame of Mexico's immigration law, I think was the headline last year.
[02:34:18.473 --> 02:34:24.037]  But now they've made a deal that unlimited from Guatemala all the way down to El Salvador.
[02:34:24.838 --> 02:34:39.929]  The Gazette.com, Colorado Gazette reports with the charities, the Catholic Church and others that are loading up the people and bringing them up into the United States where the Border Patrol militarily salutes
[02:34:40.669 --> 02:34:45.733]  Puts them on buses to bring them in deeper, gives them vouchers to be sent to whoever they want to go to.
[02:34:46.294 --> 02:34:55.662]  I mean, just open borders with the government, conduiting the Central and South American people of the destitute with their children.
[02:34:55.722 --> 02:34:56.883]  I mean, just pouring in.
[02:34:58.204 --> 02:35:00.406]  This is an unbelievable criminal operation.
[02:35:01.667 --> 02:35:02.708]  And they're going to get away with it.
[02:35:03.581 --> 02:35:10.903]  And they're going to get away with funding Al-Qaeda to take over Iraq and Syria, calling them ISIS, and they're going to get away with anything, I guess, if we let them.
[02:35:12.043 --> 02:35:13.463]  And here's the issue about crime.
[02:35:14.163 --> 02:35:18.164]  Once a government gets to this level of tyranny, the sky's the limit.
[02:35:19.044 --> 02:35:19.804]  And we've now reached it.
[02:35:19.864 --> 02:35:20.965]  You think this is crazy?
[02:35:22.585 --> 02:35:26.286]  They'll probably start arresting people like me and just shooting patriots in the street or something.
[02:35:26.506 --> 02:35:28.706]  And then a civil war will start.
[02:35:28.726 --> 02:35:31.547]  Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs has no criminal record.
[02:35:32.441 --> 02:35:33.423]  I'm gonna get him on the air about this.
[02:35:33.463 --> 02:35:33.943]  Maybe tomorrow.
[02:35:33.963 --> 02:35:34.985]  I just got swamped with the news.
[02:35:35.786 --> 02:35:37.929]  And he sold the three or four guns he had.
[02:35:37.949 --> 02:35:39.251]  He's been in the army, gone for years.
[02:35:39.752 --> 02:35:45.280]  Before he moved down here to raise some cash, he got down here and he wants to get a rifle and, you know, stuff to go shooting with us.
[02:35:46.368 --> 02:35:50.612]  He goes in, time after time, they go, oh, sorry, you've been denied, we'll call you back, and they never do.
[02:35:50.632 --> 02:35:54.476]  Well, it's supposed to then trigger that they're supposed to give you the gun, there's no record, they won't do it.
[02:35:54.836 --> 02:36:05.946]  He, honorable discharge, he's got the plaque on his office, purple heart plaques, the whole nine yards, Esquire magazine articles about him jumping off armored vehicles and stabbing Al-Qaeda in the neck and all the rest of it.
[02:36:05.967 --> 02:36:06.947]  I mean, he's a well-known soldier.
[02:36:08.789 --> 02:36:14.734]  He cannot get a gun, and most vets I know, Korea War vets, Vietnam vets, I know guys that are grandpas.
[02:36:15.174 --> 02:36:21.519]  One guy's a famous NFL football player, was a UT football player, and I talked to him at a party, a birthday party years ago.
[02:36:21.539 --> 02:36:30.666]  It's been going on for a while, about five years ago, and he cannot get a rifle for his grandson, and he can't buy guns.
[02:36:30.686 --> 02:36:36.210]  I mean, he's got dozens of guns, has no criminal record, they just, no one will sell him a gun.
[02:36:37.561 --> 02:36:39.962]  And that's because there's this lawlessness.
[02:36:40.022 --> 02:36:41.322]  I mean, the illegals are legal.
[02:36:41.362 --> 02:36:42.042]  There's no law.
[02:36:42.082 --> 02:36:42.742]  They just do it.
[02:36:42.782 --> 02:36:43.643]  It's violating the law.
[02:36:45.283 --> 02:36:48.284]  There's no law.
[02:36:48.324 --> 02:36:49.284]  They can't give him a gun.
[02:36:51.245 --> 02:36:52.465]  But they won't sell him one.
[02:36:53.065 --> 02:36:56.546]  Because it's all digital under FBI control and the NICS system.
[02:36:58.721 --> 02:37:00.962]  And you've seen Bill Clinton when he left office.
[02:37:01.382 --> 02:37:04.084]  They denied 87,000 troops being able to have guns.
[02:37:04.544 --> 02:37:08.286]  They just put them on a list if they'd ever even been interviewed for PTSD.
[02:37:08.346 --> 02:37:10.908]  Well, you're not not allowed to own guns if you have PTSD.
[02:37:12.188 --> 02:37:13.729]  Half the time the diagnosis is wrong.
[02:37:14.950 --> 02:37:26.816]  But the issue here is this is the undemocratic extrajudicial purge where the bureaucracy does whatever it wants and selectively enforces laws or doesn't even follow the law.
[02:37:28.581 --> 02:37:30.382]  And that's what this whole digital system is about.
[02:37:30.702 --> 02:37:32.443]  That's why they want to ban private sales.
[02:37:32.463 --> 02:37:37.546]  That's why they want to ban you selling your neighbor a gun, or giving your son a gun, or giving grandpa a gun, or vice versa.
[02:37:38.587 --> 02:37:41.088]  I've given my dad probably four guns over the years.
[02:37:41.588 --> 02:37:43.029]  He's probably given me ten guns.
[02:37:44.810 --> 02:37:45.610]  And I've got them all.
[02:37:46.231 --> 02:37:47.411]  And they've all gone up in value.
[02:37:49.112 --> 02:37:54.275]  And the reason you get more guns is they're cool, you want to have more, you shoot them, you talk to them, it's a culture.
[02:37:57.043 --> 02:38:00.364]  Extra-judicially, folks, if they can get the veterans, they're gonna get us all.
[02:38:00.384 --> 02:38:04.446]  A lot of people go, I don't care, I'm not a veteran, I don't care if they take their guns.
[02:38:05.187 --> 02:38:07.247]  I love this self-centered way people think.
[02:38:08.448 --> 02:38:10.609]  As if, oh, it's not happening to me today.
[02:38:10.669 --> 02:38:12.450]  Like, I don't care, I don't own a coal power plant.
[02:38:12.730 --> 02:38:13.850]  Why do I care if they shut it off?
[02:38:13.990 --> 02:38:15.551]  Because half your energy comes from it, dummy.
[02:38:17.284 --> 02:38:20.807]  People, they think their ignorance and their arrogance is a shield.
[02:38:21.107 --> 02:38:21.427]  It's not.
[02:38:21.468 --> 02:38:22.128]  It's an enslavement.
[02:38:22.608 --> 02:38:24.930]  Okay, they just reconnected from the Far Bridge.
[02:38:25.131 --> 02:38:25.931]  That's the name of the bridge.
[02:38:26.191 --> 02:38:27.332]  They'll tell you the town they're near.
[02:38:27.633 --> 02:38:34.699]  This is where Breitbart was, Sunday, where the Border Patrol told them they couldn't be there, quote, for their safety.
[02:38:35.950 --> 02:38:53.476]  They're at the International Bridge, right down on the edge of the border, and the Rio Grande on the United States side, right there by Military Highway 281, and they are reporting from that area.
[02:38:53.816 --> 02:38:59.117]  I wanted to tell us why they just had to pull out a moment ago to a, quote, safer place, what run-ins they've had with the Border Patrol.
[02:38:59.157 --> 02:39:00.538]  He's trying to get the press out of the area.
[02:39:01.178 --> 02:39:07.279]  Because I don't want people getting video of this train of death coming in and other things that happened since I talked to him on the Sunday show last night.
[02:39:07.619 --> 02:39:09.859]  Kit Daniels and Rob Jacobson reporting from the border.
[02:39:10.120 --> 02:39:11.060]  Kit, what can you tell us?
[02:39:11.980 --> 02:39:19.161]  Well, we just drove from Brownsville, Texas, about 60 miles parallel to the Mexican border to reach here for International Bridge.
[02:39:19.961 --> 02:39:23.042]  And this entire time we've seen only one Border Patrol vehicle.
[02:39:23.262 --> 02:39:25.222]  This entire trip.
[02:39:26.562 --> 02:39:30.343]  Yet, we've seen maybe four or five state troopers on the way up here.
[02:39:31.657 --> 02:39:41.762]  And we, uh, last night we randomly took a side road near the border near Brownsville, and we encountered a wide open border gate.
[02:39:41.782 --> 02:39:43.543]  Completely wide open, unguarded.
[02:39:44.743 --> 02:39:55.468]  And I wanted to come here to emphasize the fact that here, an international bridge, which is very well known, is, it looks like an actual, what you'd expect on the border.
[02:39:56.149 --> 02:40:00.391]  But, going back to the south where we came from, on this
[02:40:01.420 --> 02:40:08.994]  To reach here, we've only seen several holes in the border fence, and it's just unbelievable.
[02:40:09.535 --> 02:40:11.178]  And only one Border Patrol agent.
[02:40:12.133 --> 02:40:15.374]  Well, you know, I told you this basically was the headline yesterday.
[02:40:15.414 --> 02:40:16.895]  National Review went with it today.
[02:40:18.715 --> 02:40:21.296]  What an open border looks like in the Rio Grande Valley.
[02:40:21.316 --> 02:40:24.497]  Illegal border crossers are surrendering voluntarily.
[02:40:24.977 --> 02:40:27.018]  That is the headline today, Kit.
[02:40:27.498 --> 02:40:28.199]  That's what's happening.
[02:40:28.219 --> 02:40:34.501]  The Border Patrol is now a delivery agent, a taxi service, to get them to Greyhound buses and pay for the ticket.
[02:40:37.768 --> 02:40:45.850]  And so, what we want to do here is go with that, and then go with the headline in the video, Border Patrol Leaves Border Gates Open.
[02:40:46.251 --> 02:40:47.731]  Border Patrol Stands Down.
[02:40:48.051 --> 02:40:50.992]  Sub-headline, Border Effectively Erased.
[02:40:51.752 --> 02:40:57.474]  And then just write about how they're a taxi service, showing the Jacari Jackson video of them admitting they paid a
[02:40:57.734 --> 02:41:01.577]  Now get them into the interior, and we have total treason documented.
[02:41:01.837 --> 02:41:08.421]  Then Sherry on top, in the article you're going to write tonight, and again you've done a fabulous job, is why are there checkpoints on the highways?
[02:41:08.681 --> 02:41:11.743]  Why is their army at the Kite Festival in Austin searching people?
[02:41:12.204 --> 02:41:14.365]  Why is the TSA groping us?
[02:41:14.685 --> 02:41:17.487]  This is total, sickening treason.
[02:41:17.547 --> 02:41:19.108]  This is unbelievable.
[02:41:19.148 --> 02:41:20.329]  Kit, please continue reporting.
[02:41:20.981 --> 02:41:27.705]  Well, I read Kurt Nimmo's article this morning about Senator Feinstein saying, hey, another 9-11 is going to happen.
[02:41:28.346 --> 02:41:34.150]  The terrorists are just going to... We've got to have intelligence abuse the force of amendment to save us from terrorists.
[02:41:34.890 --> 02:41:42.695]  But what I've seen the past few days is wide open borders where illegal aliens can just roam across the border with impunity.
[02:41:43.496 --> 02:41:46.418]  And when they do encounter border patrol agents, a few that actually do,
[02:41:47.176 --> 02:41:52.157]  They are treated better than what we're treated when we are in line at the airport, the TSA.
[02:41:53.637 --> 02:42:05.400]  So it shows, to look into the border collapse that's now occurring is key to understanding how government spins reality.
[02:42:06.800 --> 02:42:11.942]  It goes back to the Roman Emperor Deal Clinton's problem, reaction, solution.
[02:42:11.962 --> 02:42:13.122]  They're going to take a crisis.
[02:42:13.780 --> 02:42:14.621]  We're good to go.
[02:42:33.406 --> 02:42:38.468]  Not only their own agenda, but they're also spinning the war on terrorism to fit their own agenda as well.
[02:42:38.488 --> 02:42:39.668]  Well, Kit, you've done a great job.
[02:42:39.688 --> 02:42:41.468]  We're going to come back to you in a few minutes.
[02:42:41.568 --> 02:42:43.889]  That lob's a little windy there in the high wind.
[02:42:43.909 --> 02:42:45.670]  We're going to try to go to handheld here.
[02:42:45.690 --> 02:42:47.890]  So I'm going to go back to you in just a moment there.
[02:42:48.150 --> 02:42:56.233]  Our reporters down on the south Texas border with Mexico confirming just all sorts of critical data.
[02:42:57.293 --> 02:42:59.935]  Again, we broke last week, and Drudge Report carried it.
[02:43:00.936 --> 02:43:11.864]  DrudgeReport.com carried the Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com articles confirming that the Border Patrol busses them in from the border and then pays to put them on Greyhound to ship them anywhere they want to go.
[02:43:12.344 --> 02:43:13.785]  That's confirmed on video.
[02:43:14.286 --> 02:43:20.570]  The border is wide open, but if I want to go to a UT football game, they now have TSA-style checkpoints.
[02:43:20.590 --> 02:43:22.672]  They will, a man will grab my genitals.
[02:43:23.493 --> 02:43:25.694]  So, I'm not going, even though I don't want to see the game anyways.
[02:43:25.734 --> 02:43:26.195]  I'm not going.
[02:43:27.075 --> 02:43:28.836]  Uh, you know, when family's in town, I might want to go.
[02:43:28.876 --> 02:43:36.001]  I still occasionally, every few years, will go to a UT football game just to see the spectacle of the simulated warfare and then people being turned into animals.
[02:43:37.342 --> 02:43:42.786]  Uh, but expanding on all of that, uh, it is just absolutely incredible.
[02:43:44.028 --> 02:44:08.731]  that we have gotten to this point uh... as a society that the government can openly fund al-qaeda and we cover it for three years plus the proxy war in syria then they change the name from al-qaeda to isis and have them invade iraq and obama goes i don't think i'll help the president i don't think i'll help the prime minister we're just gonna you know let them take over because they run them
[02:44:10.307 --> 02:44:17.532]  I mean, I'm getting to the point now with cops or anybody running around all paranoid like there's terrorists everywhere, it's an excuse to take over.
[02:44:19.273 --> 02:44:25.757]  And to be down there and see border gates just open and to have the border patrol come up to our guys
[02:44:27.506 --> 02:44:32.748]  I want to have them go back down to the border checkpoint that's only about 100 yards away, because guaranteed they'll run up and say, get out of here, get out of here.
[02:44:33.088 --> 02:44:39.050]  Then we can say, hey, we're here to report that you guys are busing them into the country and giving them vouchers.
[02:44:39.090 --> 02:44:43.871]  We need that interaction with them showing that they're being told this.
[02:44:44.732 --> 02:44:47.032]  That is absolutely essential.
[02:44:47.072 --> 02:44:47.813]  But there's the headline.
[02:44:47.853 --> 02:44:51.554]  City official admits Border Patrol fronting cash to bus illegals.
[02:44:52.779 --> 02:44:59.324]  Border Patrol purchasing bus tickets, vouchers for illegal immigrants while saddling border towns with housing burden.
[02:44:59.384 --> 02:45:02.547]  I mean, it literally is to collapse the country.
[02:45:03.507 --> 02:45:13.455]  The most poor, no jobs, no school, multiple kids, women just showing up to go directly on the welfare roll and to vote 100% Democratic.
[02:45:16.340 --> 02:45:19.628]  And the Republican leadership's going along with it because they want to defeat the Tea Party.
[02:45:20.169 --> 02:45:22.054]  They want to balkanize and break the country up.
[02:45:22.074 --> 02:45:22.996]  Were we able to get a better mic?
[02:45:26.468 --> 02:45:30.052]  Alright, well we'll have to go back to that one if it doesn't happen.
[02:45:30.072 --> 02:45:31.113]  Maybe it broke, I don't know.
[02:45:31.993 --> 02:45:38.960]  But maybe we can get them to go down by the Border Patrol checkpoint itself or tell us why they moved from that position to where they're at.
[02:45:39.661 --> 02:45:43.284]  Maybe get into an area where there's not a bunch of wind so we can talk to them.
[02:45:44.566 --> 02:45:50.772]  But again, ladies and gentlemen, reporting for InfoWars.com from the border.
[02:45:52.608 --> 02:45:58.731]  I mean, listen, they say it's racist if you point out that totally undocumented illegals carry diseases.
[02:45:58.891 --> 02:46:00.952]  I mean, have you been to South America, Central America?
[02:46:01.692 --> 02:46:04.793]  Doctors warn of looming health crisis due to flood of young illegal immigrants.
[02:46:05.234 --> 02:46:08.735]  Well, that's what it's supposed to do is bankrupt the country.
[02:46:08.755 --> 02:46:09.936]  What do you think Obamacare is?
[02:46:10.356 --> 02:46:11.536]  What do you think Cloward and Piven is?
[02:46:11.556 --> 02:46:12.617]  What do you think Senate 21 is?
[02:46:12.937 --> 02:46:15.198]  What do you think shutting down the power plants is?
[02:46:18.874 --> 02:46:19.935]  This is the reality.
[02:46:20.495 --> 02:46:23.237]  New sensors will scoop up big data on Chicago.
[02:46:24.417 --> 02:46:35.384]  Metal fixtures going up will grab, that look like pieces of sculpture, but they'll provide big step forward that Chicago understands itself by observing the city's people and surroundings.
[02:46:36.284 --> 02:46:43.369]  Inside of the sculptures will be, quote, data collection sensors and see
[02:46:44.492 --> 02:46:48.558]  They call it a air quality, light intensity, sound volume.
[02:46:48.998 --> 02:46:49.839]  That's microphones.
[02:46:50.480 --> 02:46:53.404]  See, they're not putting up light poles that have microphones that listen to you.
[02:46:53.765 --> 02:46:58.571]  It's a sound volume or gunshot detector, though it's used to listen to you, see?
[02:46:59.764 --> 02:47:00.445]  This is 1984.
[02:47:00.705 --> 02:47:01.025]  It's not.
[02:47:01.305 --> 02:47:05.949]  Chicago's putting up Homeland Security funded systems that have cell towers hidden in them.
[02:47:06.890 --> 02:47:13.335]  We broke this a few months ago in Seattle to steal all your data, and it turns out it's illegal, so they had to stop.
[02:47:13.596 --> 02:47:13.916]  No, no, no.
[02:47:13.956 --> 02:47:15.657]  In Chicago, it's a sculpture.
[02:47:15.677 --> 02:47:16.998]  You're not against art, are you?
[02:47:18.239 --> 02:47:21.142]  New sensors will scoop up big data on Chicago.
[02:47:23.854 --> 02:47:27.537]  The sensors will also count people by measuring wireless signals on mobile devices.
[02:47:27.958 --> 02:47:30.920]  This was put in eight years ago first in England, now in other cities in the U.S.
[02:47:30.960 --> 02:47:31.861]  last year and this year.
[02:47:32.461 --> 02:47:37.786]  And it tracks everything you do in real time, bypassing even the telecoms, paying to get the data from them.
[02:47:37.806 --> 02:47:42.210]  It just, government's going to grab the data from you itself, but also have its own network.
[02:47:42.570 --> 02:47:43.791]  But it's in a sculpture.
[02:47:43.811 --> 02:47:45.833]  Yeah, I mean, come on.
[02:47:47.534 --> 02:47:50.297]  And people still keep making jokes about me covering the New York Times.
[02:47:51.889 --> 02:47:53.230]  We're good to go.
[02:48:16.693 --> 02:48:18.133]  Okay, we've got the crew back, guys.
[02:48:18.373 --> 02:48:22.814]  What was it you said that was a dangerous area you were in, and so you guys had to move before coming on?
[02:48:22.854 --> 02:48:25.135]  What happened there, and what else has been unfolding, Kit?
[02:48:25.955 --> 02:48:31.536]  We took a back road to south of the highway to look for a place near the border fence to make our shoot.
[02:48:32.556 --> 02:48:42.658]  And there was, we passed by a police station, like a little small town police station, which just so happens to have one of those surveillance towers.
[02:48:43.496 --> 02:48:45.078]  And we looked at it, and I was like, wow, what is that?
[02:48:45.819 --> 02:48:46.620]  Why is that out here?
[02:48:46.980 --> 02:48:53.688]  So we kept driving, and it's just wide open fences, no Border Patrol whatsoever.
[02:48:53.708 --> 02:48:56.852]  It's just, it gives you a really eerie, uncomfortable feeling.
[02:48:57.032 --> 02:48:58.314]  It's all just brush land.
[02:48:59.255 --> 02:49:01.538]  Like, just about anybody can hide anywhere out there.
[02:49:03.602 --> 02:49:05.083]  Now, we've got a report you filed.
[02:49:05.143 --> 02:49:05.944]  I thought it was coming.
[02:49:05.964 --> 02:49:07.565]  You guys did such a great job shooting this.
[02:49:07.645 --> 02:49:08.565]  It's already done.
[02:49:08.585 --> 02:49:12.668]  We're going to premiere it here coming up in the next segment and keep you some into overdrive.
[02:49:12.988 --> 02:49:16.811]  Kit Daniels and Rob Jacobson reporting from the Texas border.
[02:49:16.871 --> 02:49:27.217]  But in this new video, and I think we're going to title it, I guess, Border Wide Open, Border Patrol Stands Down, or Border Patrol Leaves Gates Open.
[02:49:27.518 --> 02:49:29.759]  I guess we already have the video of that we're about to show folks.
[02:49:30.079 --> 02:49:32.681]  When we come back from break, describe what else you've seen, Kit.
[02:49:33.619 --> 02:49:36.080]  It just hit me like a ton of bricks.
[02:49:37.260 --> 02:49:45.903]  The state troopers and the small town cops here are doing a better job at border security and what the border patrol can do.
[02:49:46.443 --> 02:49:50.784]  That's why we just saw a city surveillance tower right near the border.
[02:49:52.004 --> 02:50:00.747]  Driving up here we saw two or three state troopers parked every so often down the highway.
[02:50:01.596 --> 02:50:06.340]  The state of Texas and local police are having to step in to protect the borders.
[02:50:06.540 --> 02:50:24.575]  And let's be clear, just like in Mexico the government wouldn't do its job and disarm the people so the crime rate exploded, citizens got guns illegally, restored order, just like the feds are stepping back, that's a major important angle right there to confirm in the new report on when you guys get back, because I know you're coming back tonight, is the fact that Texas
[02:50:26.057 --> 02:50:36.365]  ...steps in when Border Patrol stands down, because you say you've seen almost no Border Patrol, and I've been down there, it's usually crawling, so now you're seeing state police and locals having to step in.
[02:50:36.886 --> 02:50:46.534]  And I want to emphasize that the Border Patrol agent that we did see, he was just on the shoulder of Highway 281, and is likely probably taking a phone call.
[02:50:46.854 --> 02:50:49.737]  It wasn't like we saw him out in the Badlands that we just drove through.
[02:50:51.284 --> 02:50:52.146]  Oh, this is amazing.
[02:50:52.386 --> 02:50:54.991]  I've got your special report coming up and we're going to come back to you.
[02:50:55.431 --> 02:50:57.355]  Kit Daniels from the border.
[02:50:57.735 --> 02:50:59.338]  Infowars.com.
[02:50:59.759 --> 02:51:03.405]  I'm Alex Jones and we're going to come back and play this report.
[02:51:04.126 --> 02:51:04.567]  Stay with us.
[02:51:07.571 --> 02:51:08.732]  Hey, this is Steve Sanchez.
[02:51:08.892 --> 02:51:10.253]  Worried about the Wall Street Casino?
[02:51:10.333 --> 02:51:10.914]  Yeah, me too.
[02:51:11.034 --> 02:51:13.155]  Wondering when the stock market is going to collapse?
[02:51:13.275 --> 02:51:16.278]  You probably want answers, but you know you can't trust the Global Elite.

[02:51:37.094 --> 02:51:46.358]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:51:46.398 --> 02:51:47.138]  This capitalism?
[02:51:47.198 --> 02:51:53.321]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:51:53.361 --> 02:51:57.003]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[02:54:15.919 --> 02:54:21.321]  I also kind of want to get Rob Jacobson's take on what he's seen while he's been down there in overdrive, so perhaps we'll do that.
[02:54:21.721 --> 02:54:26.562]  We're going to their report that shows the Border Patrol leaving gates open now, and just leaving at night.
[02:54:26.642 --> 02:54:28.183]  I mean, that's how wide open this is.
[02:54:28.843 --> 02:54:29.944]  This is totally insane.
[02:54:29.964 --> 02:54:35.988]  Before I go any further, please remember this hour was brought to you by MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex.

[02:55:36.954 --> 02:55:38.456]  We've got some new items coming this week.
[02:55:38.796 --> 02:55:43.261]  Made in America apparel and new Molon Labe belt buckles as well coming to MadeIn1776.com.
[02:55:46.104 --> 02:55:55.432]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, let's go ahead and go to the Border Report, showing more evidence of a complete treasonous stand-down.
[02:55:56.633 --> 02:56:14.108]  In the border city of Brownsville, Texas, the incredible decrease of Border Patrol activity emphasizes that not only is the Border Patrol stretched thin, but agents are also being pressured to stand down from enforcing immigration laws as the federal government also begins to enact a media blackout on America's vanishing borders.
[02:56:14.468 --> 02:56:21.729]  We're here at the international border in Brownsville, Texas, and as you can see, there's hardly any border patrol whatsoever, even at the border.
[02:56:22.129 --> 02:56:29.931]  You would think with the current flood of tens of thousands of immigrants from Central America overwhelming our borders, Brownsville would be crawling with border patrol vehicles.
[02:56:30.491 --> 02:56:40.833]  But, on the extreme contrary, we saw, no exaggeration, well over ten times as many border patrol vehicles parked at various facilities than we saw driving the streets in and around Brownsville.
[02:56:41.793 --> 02:56:49.762]  In fact, we stood for well over an hour outside the border checkpoint in the city and only saw maybe one border patrol vehicle every 10 to 15 minutes drive by.
[02:56:52.164 --> 02:56:53.946]  Just look at this wide open border fence.
[02:56:54.427 --> 02:56:55.888]  It's at night and nobody's guarding it.
[02:56:55.988 --> 02:56:56.709]  It's wide open.
[02:56:57.570 --> 02:57:01.034]  This just highlights the illusion of border security by the Obama administration.
[02:57:03.035 --> 02:57:11.418]  Consider the fact that the surge of immigrant youth has increased from 6,500 in 2011 to 90,000 this year alone, an increase of over 1,300 percent.
[02:57:11.898 --> 02:57:18.220]  And it's crystal clear that the Obama administration is forcing the Border Patrol to back off of enforcing existing immigration laws.
[02:57:19.446 --> 02:57:25.432]  One of the very few Border Patrol agents that we observed actually patrolling South Texas took a very keen interest in us.
[02:57:25.873 --> 02:57:29.797]  As you can see, he speeds up to catch up to our vehicle and likely ran our plates.
[02:57:30.157 --> 02:57:32.740]  We tried to flag him down to talk to him, but he didn't respond.
[02:57:33.160 --> 02:57:37.985]  He tailed us very closely for several minutes nearly all the way into downtown Brownsville before he finally peeled off.
[02:57:38.946 --> 02:57:40.488]  We were driving around the border.
[02:57:40.508 --> 02:57:42.630]  I guess he took an interest in us.
[02:57:45.134 --> 02:57:50.977]  We're standing outside an illegal immigration detention facility about 40 miles northeast of Brownsville, Texas.
[02:57:51.578 --> 02:58:00.162]  We drove down to the guard station and asked if we could take a tour of the facility as journalists, but they refused, told us to turn around, and even told us to stop recording.
[02:58:00.182 --> 02:58:01.943]  We're journalists out of Austin.
[02:58:02.003 --> 02:58:03.544]  Is it possible for us to take a look around?
[02:58:04.044 --> 02:58:04.305]  No, sir.
[02:58:04.445 --> 02:58:04.825]  Drive around?
[02:58:05.920 --> 02:58:07.722]  You will have to call in and get an appointment.
[02:58:07.822 --> 02:58:09.783]  There are signs, you do have one sign, not to be recorded.
[02:58:09.803 --> 02:58:10.484]  Okay, that's fine.
[02:58:10.684 --> 02:58:14.426]  Over the past few weeks, the Feds have been shutting down areas immediately on the U.S.
[02:58:14.446 --> 02:58:17.228]  side of the border which have traditionally been open to the public.
[02:58:17.969 --> 02:58:21.111]  Now they are closing them down by citing safety concerns.
[02:58:21.752 --> 02:58:23.733]  Do not enter, authorized personnel only.
[02:58:24.294 --> 02:58:28.076]  Signs like these have been popping up the last couple of weeks on our side of the border.
[02:58:28.637 --> 02:58:32.780]  They keep the public and the press away and in the dark about the border collapse.
[02:58:33.160 --> 02:58:38.582]  This is simply a media blackout that allows the Obama administration to control the narrative on illegal immigration.
[02:58:39.443 --> 02:58:46.846]  They've already been doing just that by deceptively skewing the number of deportations in their favor by classifying cases... Alright, we'll be right back, folks.
[02:58:46.886 --> 02:58:51.688]  We'll put the full report up on InfoWars.com so radio listeners can see it in the next 30 minutes.
[02:58:51.888 --> 02:58:55.330]  We'll be back in overdrive with some final analysis.
[02:58:55.370 --> 02:58:55.790]  Stay with us.
[02:58:55.890 --> 02:58:56.551]  InfoWars.com.
[02:58:57.651 --> 02:59:04.717]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:59:04.838 --> 02:59:07.000]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:59:07.180 --> 02:59:12.284]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:59:12.464 --> 02:59:17.409]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:59:17.609 --> 02:59:20.671]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:59:20.932 --> 02:59:24.794]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:59:25.014 --> 02:59:29.258]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:59:29.338 --> 02:59:39.385]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:59:39.565 --> 02:59:42.087]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs
[02:59:42.227 --> 02:59:42.887]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:42.927 --> 02:59:43.887]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:43.967 --> 02:59:46.368]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:13.777 --> 03:00:14.397]  Big Brother.
[03:00:15.077 --> 03:00:16.118]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:16.838 --> 03:00:17.958]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:18.598 --> 03:00:19.419]  You want answers?
[03:00:20.179 --> 03:00:21.179]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:21.739 --> 03:00:25.360]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:25.920 --> 03:00:30.001]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:37.762 --> 03:00:39.703]  Final segment, doing a bit of overdrive here.
[03:00:40.524 --> 03:00:42.185]  Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[03:00:42.665 --> 03:00:45.547]  Lord willing, I'll be back live tomorrow at 11am with the weekday transmission.
[03:00:46.388 --> 03:00:47.649]  Big broadcast week coming up.
[03:00:50.991 --> 03:01:01.719]  Oh boy, I tell you, just seeing our borders wide open, seeing the Border Patrol going after the media, seeing the Border Patrol pay to ship people deeper into the U.S., seeing them leave the gates open at night.
[03:01:02.574 --> 03:01:05.496]  They've been giving orders to get rid of the border at North American Union.
[03:01:06.036 --> 03:01:10.339]  Kit, any other points you think are important to make or breaking news you're going to have when you get back to Austin?
[03:01:11.019 --> 03:01:12.140]  Any little prelude to there?
[03:01:12.200 --> 03:01:15.642]  Anything Jacobson, running camera, would like to say about his observations?
[03:01:16.042 --> 03:01:18.564]  Well first, I want to point out that sign right there.
[03:01:18.584 --> 03:01:19.945]  I don't know if you can see it on air.
[03:01:20.954 --> 03:01:23.795]  That is the largest gun control sign I've ever seen in my life.
[03:01:24.355 --> 03:01:28.897]  It's exactly the kind of signs that Michael Bloomberg would love to see on every street corner in America.
[03:01:29.117 --> 03:01:32.138]  Yeah, earlier, before your Skype degraded, it was crystal clear.
[03:01:32.158 --> 03:01:36.319]  It said, warning, firearms and ammunition are illegal in Mexico.
[03:01:36.359 --> 03:01:37.220]  You will be arrested.
[03:01:37.720 --> 03:01:39.741]  And you should get some digital photos of that.
[03:01:40.221 --> 03:01:43.582]  That's a whole other story to show that they have the highest crime rate in the world.
[03:01:43.622 --> 03:01:44.702]  And there it is.
[03:01:44.942 --> 03:01:46.103]  Bloomberg should love it.
[03:01:46.483 --> 03:01:48.904]  Because only the drug dealers and the criminal government have the weapons.
[03:01:49.858 --> 03:01:50.519]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:01:50.759 --> 03:01:55.083]  I mean, they might as well put a sign on the Mexican side that says, welcome to the USA, criminals.
[03:01:56.224 --> 03:01:57.064]  That big of a sign.
[03:01:58.325 --> 03:02:09.775]  The second point I wanted to make is that we talk a lot about Cloward and Piven as far as, I saw an article on InfoWars, I think about two weeks ago, about how Cloward and Piven is being used to bring in amnesty.
[03:02:10.576 --> 03:02:11.697]  But it goes beyond that.
[03:02:12.218 --> 03:02:14.920]  Cloward and Piven is being used to bring in the North American Union.
[03:02:16.081 --> 03:02:21.815]  By... We see the CIA in the past several decades basically collapse South America and Central America with their misdeeds.
[03:02:22.825 --> 03:02:31.412]  And then now we see Mexico is pretty much opening up their southern border because they're going to believe that El Norte will take care of the problem.
[03:02:31.432 --> 03:02:33.694]  Because they're like, well, they're not going to stay in Mexico.
[03:02:33.714 --> 03:02:34.755]  They're just going to go up north.
[03:02:34.815 --> 03:02:35.776]  So why should we worry about it?
[03:02:35.796 --> 03:02:41.181]  Yeah, now Senator Cornyn says give money to Mexico, billions, so that they'll make it more orderly.
[03:02:41.201 --> 03:02:44.704]  And they'll probably, you know, fund first class tickets up here.
[03:02:44.724 --> 03:02:46.505]  The Republican leadership is deeply involved.
[03:02:46.946 --> 03:02:48.747]  This is the North American Union
[03:02:49.721 --> 03:02:50.762]  I think so.
[03:03:11.295 --> 03:03:26.346]  Honing it down to an economic model and that's what this is and you watch that they've already said Amnesty is the way to fix the flood of illegals because you just make them legal Absolutely, and it goes back to what I said earlier about problem reaction solution.
[03:03:26.366 --> 03:03:36.914]  They senator Feinstein's looking at oh well terrorism we have to We have to give the NSA more funding and more power to save us from terrorists this typical problem reaction solution
[03:03:37.194 --> 03:03:39.817]  And they're funding and running and helping the terrorists.
[03:03:39.837 --> 03:03:41.478]  Well, you've got a lot to report when you get back.
[03:03:41.498 --> 03:03:44.981]  A lot of HD videos about to go live on Infowars.com.
[03:03:45.001 --> 03:03:48.805]  If you're a radio listener and missed what we just played, we'll have the full report up there.
[03:03:48.845 --> 03:03:50.246]  But, again, great job.
[03:03:50.286 --> 03:03:51.187]  I know it's a dangerous area.
[03:03:51.207 --> 03:03:52.128]  I appreciate both of you.
[03:03:52.528 --> 03:03:55.331]  You want to... Jacobson can just aim the camera at the sun if he wants.
[03:03:55.791 --> 03:03:58.514]  Ask him if he's got any final points he wants to make.
[03:03:59.724 --> 03:04:00.144]  Yeah, sure.
[03:04:00.184 --> 03:04:01.285]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:04:01.585 --> 03:04:05.386]  It was pretty shocking to me last night when we drove up on that open gate.
[03:04:06.207 --> 03:04:07.687]  I was actually pretty startled.
[03:04:08.007 --> 03:04:10.428]  And my impression was, it's like, well, they just opened it up.
[03:04:10.488 --> 03:04:11.429]  Come on in.
[03:04:11.789 --> 03:04:13.550]  Why not just have a big red carpet for them?
[03:04:14.030 --> 03:04:20.672]  And this morning, doing a little thinking, it occurred to me, we have a government that doesn't deport illegal aliens.
[03:04:20.692 --> 03:04:23.073]  They're actually importing illegal aliens.
[03:04:23.594 --> 03:04:26.955]  And it's pretty troubling, kind of a twilight zone.
[03:04:27.475 --> 03:04:27.655]  Yeah.
[03:04:27.675 --> 03:04:29.556]  And then now they're blocking them so the media can't get there.
[03:04:29.576 --> 03:04:30.976]  That's not just us, but others confirming it.
[03:04:31.057 --> 03:04:33.197]  It's not a lot of the Border Patrol.
[03:04:49.884 --> 03:04:53.326]  It's now the Immigrant Importation Agency.
[03:04:53.947 --> 03:04:55.347]  So that'd be IIA.
[03:04:55.928 --> 03:04:56.808]  They're gonna change the name.
[03:04:56.828 --> 03:04:58.049]  We need a satire article.
[03:04:58.189 --> 03:04:59.110]  But it's not satire!
[03:05:00.130 --> 03:05:04.493]  Border Patrol to officially change name to Immigrant Importation Agency.
[03:05:05.153 --> 03:05:06.294]  Part of the Department of Treason.
[03:05:09.696 --> 03:05:15.519]  In the near future... When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball... Security alert.
[03:05:15.539 --> 03:05:16.520]  Security alert.
