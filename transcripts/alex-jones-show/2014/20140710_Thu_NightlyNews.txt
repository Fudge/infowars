[00:00:19.631 --> 00:00:21.112]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.192 --> 00:00:21.872]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:22.052 --> 00:00:22.532]  It's July 10, 2014.
[00:00:22.973 --> 00:00:30.236]  Now, the InfoWars crew is still in Murrieta, California, and they posted this report from there.
[00:00:30.276 --> 00:00:34.438]  A pro-amnesty group of socialists are flooding Murrieta City Hall.
[00:00:34.458 --> 00:00:36.999]  Now, these are people that are coming from all over the state.
[00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:38.940]  It's not too hard to find socialists in California.
[00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.001]  All you have to do is swing a cat and you'll hit a couple of them.
[00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:46.084]  But these people are coming in with signs saying, Open the Borders, Freedom Socialist Party,
[00:00:46.804 --> 00:00:49.627]  Immigrants welcome here, among other pro-amnesty supporters.
[00:00:50.227 --> 00:00:58.295]  Now, when they were there earlier in the week, the people that were there supporting amnesty identified themselves as anarcho-communists.
[00:00:58.335 --> 00:01:00.297]  These people are identifying themselves as socialists.
[00:01:00.677 --> 00:01:05.362]  They're going into a community that is concerned about how they're going to be supported, and they're
[00:01:06.022 --> 00:01:09.444]  Not living in that community, attending that town council meeting.
[00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:24.354]  Now, one of the things we need to think about when we look at the compassion side of this, and of course that's the side that's being sold to us by the media, by the Obama administration, and yes, it is a situation where some people are in very dire straits.
[00:01:24.955 --> 00:01:35.342]  But I can tell you that when you go to adopt children, whether we're adopting children or adopting teenagers or adopting dreamers up to the age of 31, or whether we're adopting
[00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:44.669]  Full-grown adults in this country, I know from someone who's adopted children in the past that there's a vetting process when you adopt someone into your family.
[00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.912]  First, they want to know, are you able to support that person?
[00:01:48.392 --> 00:01:52.015]  They also want to know, are you going to abuse that person?
[00:01:52.035 --> 00:01:53.316]  Do you have a history of abuse?
[00:01:53.356 --> 00:01:57.099]  Are you going to be, is it going to be a safe situation for them in your home?
[00:01:57.519 --> 00:02:03.084]  Those are situations that are not being vetted for these people who are coming in, for the children who are coming in, of course.
[00:02:03.604 --> 00:02:06.787]  There's no concern about whether or not we can support them.
[00:02:06.827 --> 00:02:09.089]  And of course, they know that we can't support them.
[00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.091]  It's part of a Cloward and Piven program.
[00:02:11.672 --> 00:02:17.197]  The socialists said, this is a fight for good education, good health care, good jobs, and a decent wage for all people.
[00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:18.579]  That's something we can all admire.
[00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:22.542]  But how has the socialist utopia in South America worked out for them?
[00:02:23.183 --> 00:02:37.633]  Of course, you look at Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, and we see from just last year, we see Bloomberg bragging about how Chavez has provided a 681% return on investment for people like Goldman Sachs.
[00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:39.254]  It's boosting their profits.
[00:02:39.274 --> 00:02:43.036]  You know, they say that the capitalists will sell the rope that hangs them.
[00:02:43.416 --> 00:02:51.562]  It turns out that the bankers will pull the strings of the socialists who confiscate property from other people and promise this worker's paradise.
[00:02:51.922 --> 00:02:52.863]  Look at this quote.
[00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:57.345]  This is from Oppenheimer Funds, and this is, again, about a year and a half ago.
[00:02:57.745 --> 00:03:04.428]  Chavez hasn't done a lot of good for his country, but he has the objective to service the bonds, in other words, the banker debt.
[00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:15.173]  Our interests are aligned, and as they also point out in that article, he's nationalized farms and energy companies, he put on price caps on products like toothpaste and toilet paper.
[00:03:15.753 --> 00:03:16.254]  Today,
[00:03:16.914 --> 00:03:25.921]  We have people in Venezuela who can't get food, can't get water, can't get medicine without leaving their country, going into neighboring countries, coming into our country.
[00:03:26.401 --> 00:03:37.990]  And again, looking at this article from a year and a half ago, they said, Chavez's socialist policies have led to shortages of everything from electricity to sugar and beef, and fueled the world's third highest inflation rate.
[00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.592]  In other words, Cloward and Piven.
[00:03:40.912 --> 00:03:43.654]  And of course, they were socialist dreamers.
[00:03:44.175 --> 00:03:45.616]  Now, what's the other aspect of this?
[00:03:45.676 --> 00:03:56.184]  What about actually making sure that the children, that the young adults, that the older adults are not getting abused as we adopt them into our country, into our family?
[00:03:56.665 --> 00:03:58.546]  Take a look at this story from Breitbart.
[00:03:58.686 --> 00:04:02.910]  Baylor professor identifies the bodies of illegals who die crossing the border.
[00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.814]  Now, this professor from Baylor has found several dead children in the Texas wilderness
[00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:13.498]  And she says that doesn't tell the whole story of how dangerous it is for these thousands of unaccompanied children.
[00:04:14.018 --> 00:04:21.684]  Drug cartels, human traffickers preying on these children are beating, abusing and sexually molesting the youngsters as they try to pass over the border.
[00:04:22.024 --> 00:04:31.812]  We just heard stories of little boys and little girls forced by these drug dealers to cut off the fingers or cut off the ears of other little boys and girls in order to extort money from their families.
[00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:36.596]  These children are told if you don't cut off the fingers or ears of a different child, you'll be shot.
[00:04:37.256 --> 00:04:44.382]  Now, Senator Cruz has pointed out that all of this is the direct consequences of President Obama's lawlessness.
[00:04:44.422 --> 00:04:49.386]  In other words, he's incentivizing reckless child endangerment.
[00:04:49.867 --> 00:04:59.475]  Whether these people are sending their children over unaccompanied or whether they are accompanying them, this is a very dangerous area and dangerous activities that they're engaged in.
[00:04:59.895 --> 00:05:03.258]  This is not the way to take care of this crisis.
[00:05:03.278 --> 00:05:05.380]  And of course, the crisis in their countries
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:12.702]  Has been predominantly fueled by these bankers who are looting their countries and by the drug wars that we have foisted upon them.
[00:05:13.002 --> 00:05:14.602]  But is Obama concerned about this?
[00:05:15.082 --> 00:05:18.583]  He's here in Austin, just a couple of hundred miles from the border.
[00:05:18.783 --> 00:05:23.004]  He couldn't be bothered to go down and look at the condition of these kids.
[00:05:23.224 --> 00:05:24.945]  He's not concerned about their medical condition.
[00:05:25.225 --> 00:05:31.666]  He's not concerned about who brought them here, who they're going to be turned over to, or their condition right now, their health condition.
[00:05:32.026 --> 00:05:34.147]  No, he goes to fundraisers.
[00:05:34.747 --> 00:05:40.690]  He goes to parties in Colorado where he laughs it up and shoots pool, drinks beer.
[00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:48.414]  And we see even when he's meeting with Governor Perry here in Texas, in this meeting, he's laughing throughout.
[00:05:48.534 --> 00:05:50.595]  In all the pictures, he's laughing it up.
[00:05:50.695 --> 00:05:54.257]  And Perry says, I don't think he heard anything I had to say.
[00:05:54.597 --> 00:05:57.619]  Now look at this top picture, the one, scroll up to the one right above that.
[00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:01.301]  Do you notice this guy sitting right across the table from Obama?
[00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:03.362]  The guy with the blue tie, that guy right there?
[00:06:04.315 --> 00:06:04.936]  Look familiar?
[00:06:04.956 --> 00:06:14.243]  That's the judge in Dallas that had the ruling about how they were going to move these immigrants into an abandoned school that was paid for by the local taxpayers and then he went door-to-door
[00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:30.035]  To threaten people.
[00:06:30.075 --> 00:06:39.282]  To say, you know, you can come up, you can talk about your free speech, address your grievances, show up as demonstrators, but we have laws and you better not break them.
[00:06:39.322 --> 00:06:45.587]  And of course, Dallas has very stringent laws, as we've talked about before here on the Nightly News, about free speech.
[00:06:45.647 --> 00:06:46.988]  They don't like it very much there.
[00:06:47.028 --> 00:06:51.752]  So, if you show up and intimidate people door to door as a judge, what's that get you?
[00:06:51.772 --> 00:06:55.956]  Well, it literally gets you a place across the table from Obama.
[00:06:56.636 --> 00:07:07.992]  Now, our InfoWars crew took to the streets today at another event that Obama went to where he was talking about the economy and took the pulse of the people on the street as they were waiting to hear him speak.
[00:07:08.032 --> 00:07:08.713]  Here's that report.
[00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:17.824]  I'm standing in front of the Paramount Theater here in Austin, Texas, where His Highness President Barack Obama is headlining.
[00:07:18.264 --> 00:07:25.869]  Now, in response to his critics who wondered why he wasn't at the border while he's in Texas, he said a visit to the border would be nothing more than theater.
[00:07:26.489 --> 00:07:35.936]  And, of course, the irony is not lost on the fact that his name is on the marquee at the Paramount Theater as he's here to address his adoring fans.
[00:07:36.416 --> 00:07:40.299]  Well, we're gonna go check with some of these people, some of whom have waited since midnight
[00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:42.761]  Trying to get tickets to see the big show.
[00:07:43.441 --> 00:07:48.866]  Are you super pumped to be in the presence of the Lord and Savior Obama?
[00:07:49.006 --> 00:07:49.586]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:49.686 --> 00:07:51.868]  You know, it's not every day you see the President.
[00:07:52.028 --> 00:07:55.371]  Yes, I am, but I'm hoping to get them in too.
[00:07:55.491 --> 00:07:56.552]  I really want her to go.
[00:07:56.572 --> 00:07:58.033]  I think she'll appreciate it.
[00:07:58.494 --> 00:08:00.595]  No, I think it's more about just seeing the President.
[00:08:01.016 --> 00:08:02.397]  I've never seen a President before.
[00:08:02.617 --> 00:08:07.021]  How do you feel knowing that you might still not make it past the rope?
[00:08:08.146 --> 00:08:10.248]  Well, if that happens, we would not be very happy.
[00:08:11.229 --> 00:08:13.771]  It would be a waste of time, but at least it's worth watching.
[00:08:13.931 --> 00:08:16.533]  We heard people actually stayed overnight.
[00:08:17.313 --> 00:08:18.054]  Were there overnight?
[00:08:18.114 --> 00:08:18.534]  Yeah, they did.
[00:08:18.634 --> 00:08:19.275]  What about you guys?
[00:08:19.795 --> 00:08:20.536]  We did that, actually.
[00:08:20.556 --> 00:08:21.317]  You were there?
[00:08:21.377 --> 00:08:22.137]  What time did you get there?
[00:08:22.818 --> 00:08:23.158]  Midnight?
[00:08:23.558 --> 00:08:23.979]  Yeah, around there.
[00:08:24.479 --> 00:08:27.061]  Midnight the night before, so they could start doling out tickets at 8.30.
[00:08:27.101 --> 00:08:31.164]  So, you guys are visiting from Europe?
[00:08:31.605 --> 00:08:32.045]  Exactly.
[00:08:32.265 --> 00:08:32.926]  From Switzerland.
[00:08:33.319 --> 00:08:37.441]  So this is super exciting for you to go see the President of the United States of America?
[00:08:37.461 --> 00:08:37.941]  Indeed, yes.
[00:08:38.561 --> 00:08:38.901]  Indeed.
[00:08:39.481 --> 00:08:39.782]  Kinda.
[00:08:41.082 --> 00:08:43.083]  I gotta warn you, I work at Fox around the corner.
[00:08:43.103 --> 00:08:43.643]  Okay.
[00:08:44.323 --> 00:08:53.167]  Well, so if you had one shot to ask the President anything, let's just say he goes all maverick-y and rogue and lets people ask him a question, what would be your one question?
[00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:57.909]  Uh, I'd like to do something about student loan debt.
[00:08:58.569 --> 00:09:01.210]  I would probably just go mute and not be able to talk.
[00:09:02.205 --> 00:09:04.106]  Is he going for a third term?
[00:09:04.566 --> 00:09:06.848]  I know he can't, but... Would you like him to?
[00:09:06.868 --> 00:09:07.448]  Would you vote for him?
[00:09:07.468 --> 00:09:07.828]  Yes, I would.
[00:09:07.888 --> 00:09:08.448]  Yes, I would.
[00:09:08.709 --> 00:09:09.709]  I would vote for him.
[00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:12.551]  It'd be a toss between Clinton and Obama.
[00:09:12.851 --> 00:09:18.234]  I think I would be asking him about what he plans to do for the next two years of his presidency.
[00:09:18.274 --> 00:09:21.936]  How is he going to handle the issues that we're seeing with the gridlock?
[00:09:22.416 --> 00:09:25.678]  He's doing the best he can, obviously, but there has to be a breaking point.
[00:09:26.338 --> 00:09:28.680]  Why are you continuing the drone rolling?
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.761]  Wow, good question!
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.722]  I'd say, hey, can we hang out later?
[00:09:34.183 --> 00:09:35.685]  Do you want to hang out with the president later?
[00:09:36.205 --> 00:09:36.425]  Yes.
[00:09:37.286 --> 00:09:40.850]  How long have you been staying in Hawaii, probably?
[00:09:41.711 --> 00:09:42.131]  How long?
[00:09:42.151 --> 00:09:44.434]  Are you into Hawaii?
[00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:45.134]  Yeah.
[00:09:46.776 --> 00:09:52.242]  Do you think it's weird that people, like, hail the president as sort of a kingly figure?
[00:09:53.587 --> 00:09:55.768]  It is something you have to get used to.
[00:09:55.808 --> 00:10:03.650]  I mean, I can understand it if he's such an important person for the state, but if you come from a system where it isn't that way, it takes getting used to.
[00:10:04.411 --> 00:10:09.732]  We have people protesting the fact that he is here and not other places.
[00:10:09.832 --> 00:10:13.894]  What do you guys think about him being here and maybe there's some other things going on?
[00:10:13.934 --> 00:10:22.737]  There are always places that want the president to be there that require leadership, but he's got a
[00:10:23.646 --> 00:10:24.366]  Do the rounds.
[00:10:24.426 --> 00:10:25.186]  It's his country.
[00:10:25.286 --> 00:10:27.847]  He's gotta see all the parts of it.
[00:10:27.867 --> 00:10:30.148]  Well, it's our country.
[00:10:30.408 --> 00:10:36.809]  Were you surprised with what he said last night about the meeting between him and Perry and where he stands on what's happening at the border?
[00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:38.350]  Uh, yeah.
[00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.150]  You know, it sounds like it's politics.
[00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.851]  They're using it as a political wedge issue.
[00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:48.793]  You know, he could overturn the policy and start doing something about it now.
[00:10:48.833 --> 00:10:50.053]  He doesn't have to wait for Congress.
[00:10:50.339 --> 00:10:53.501]  This is not Obama saying, hey, Mexicans, come over the border.
[00:10:54.381 --> 00:10:59.565]  He is saying we are a country that allows people to come and request asylum.
[00:10:59.845 --> 00:11:02.667]  He really should talk about immigration.
[00:11:02.687 --> 00:11:05.828]  There's a lot of people from Latin America waiting for something.
[00:11:06.569 --> 00:11:11.672]  And I think there was a lot of time that people is really waiting for someone.
[00:11:11.692 --> 00:11:13.113]  It's not about being somewhere.
[00:11:13.153 --> 00:11:17.015]  It's about taking the right actions and knowing what's going on.
[00:11:17.656 --> 00:11:19.477]  Do you think that he is taking the right actions?
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.705]  I'm not really up to date on what he's done on the border, so...
[00:11:39.932 --> 00:11:45.495]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:11:45.735 --> 00:11:52.939]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:11:53.099 --> 00:11:56.341]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:11:56.461 --> 00:11:58.222]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:11:58.482 --> 00:12:03.065]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[00:12:03.145 --> 00:12:05.906]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[00:12:06.066 --> 00:12:11.849]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[00:12:12.009 --> 00:12:15.491]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.

[00:12:43.789 --> 00:12:50.956]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:12:51.056 --> 00:12:53.238]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:12:53.418 --> 00:12:58.623]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:12:58.783 --> 00:13:03.868]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:13:04.008 --> 00:13:07.109]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:13:07.389 --> 00:13:11.310]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:15.832]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:13:15.912 --> 00:13:26.035]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape, but that we can fight back against.
[00:13:26.255 --> 00:13:30.618]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[00:13:30.738 --> 00:13:37.182]  The new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.

[00:13:49.414 --> 00:13:49.975]  Welcome back.
[00:13:50.635 --> 00:13:54.279]  Now, if you remember a couple of months ago, we reported on a Wyoming landowner.
[00:13:54.319 --> 00:13:56.842]  This is a guy who owned about eight acres.
[00:13:57.362 --> 00:14:03.528]  And he built a private pond on those eight acres for his animals and for his children to use as a swimming pool.
[00:14:04.149 --> 00:14:10.576]  And the EPA began using him as a test case for new powers that they're giving themselves.
[00:14:11.156 --> 00:14:16.019]  Now they've gone one more step further, and this is a story that's from the Washington Times.
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:17.340]  Power grab.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.142]  EPA wants to garnish the wages of polluters.
[00:14:21.443 --> 00:14:22.863]  Now understand how this has evolved.
[00:14:22.923 --> 00:14:25.045]  First, they jumped onto private land.
[00:14:25.065 --> 00:14:27.646]  They've never regulated private land before.
[00:14:28.067 --> 00:14:32.930]  This is water that is not coming onto his property or going off of his property.
[00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.351]  This is unprecedented in that case.
[00:14:35.791 --> 00:14:37.953]  The next thing they did was they levied a $75,000
[00:14:40.154 --> 00:14:42.275]  Per day, fine on the man.
[00:14:42.315 --> 00:14:45.075]  And they don't report that accurately in the article.
[00:14:45.115 --> 00:14:47.756]  They say that they slapped a $75,000 fine on him.
[00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:50.617]  No, that's per day they're charging him $75,000.
[00:14:50.857 --> 00:15:00.739]  They also say that they're accused of violating their own rules, a power currently used by agencies like the IRS.
[00:15:00.839 --> 00:15:02.480]  Now, that's not a legitimate power.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.900]  And I'm going to tell you why.
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.881]  We need to catch this because
[00:15:06.701 --> 00:15:13.584]  If you allow this kind of usurpation to stand, and the longer you allow it to stand, the more difficult it is for people to roll it back.
[00:15:14.004 --> 00:15:17.726]  As we see here, this is an organization that is reporting on this.
[00:15:17.746 --> 00:15:22.248]  They have a problem with the EPA doing it, but evidently they don't have a problem with the IRS doing it.
[00:15:22.688 --> 00:15:27.091]  The IRS doesn't have legitimate constitutional and legal powers to do that.
[00:15:27.592 --> 00:15:28.793]  But here's what they appeal to.
[00:15:28.853 --> 00:15:31.795]  They go back to the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996.
[00:15:31.975 --> 00:15:35.077]  And they say they have authority under that.
[00:15:35.498 --> 00:15:41.682]  It's centralized federal collection operations under the Treasury Department, which oversees garnishment of wages or tax refunds.
[00:15:42.122 --> 00:15:46.606]  Now actually, that is something that is, that's not where the IRS got that power.
[00:15:46.986 --> 00:15:50.748]  The IRS has been doing that for a long time and they don't even appeal to any ruling for that.
[00:15:50.808 --> 00:15:56.671]  But even if they did have a ruling, even if they had a law from Congress, it would not trump the Constitution.
[00:15:57.232 --> 00:15:58.592]  Look at what we're losing here.
[00:15:59.013 --> 00:16:01.474]  Look at the 6th Amendment that gives us due process.
[00:16:01.874 --> 00:16:03.135]  There's no due process here.
[00:16:03.255 --> 00:16:07.377]  Look at the 8th Amendment that says we will not be given excessive fines like $75,000 a day.
[00:16:10.359 --> 00:16:12.741]  That isn't excessive by anybody's standard.
[00:16:13.322 --> 00:16:20.869]  It also says that if there's a civil action, and that's the way that they're doing this, they're saying, these are not criminal actions so we don't have to give you a jury trial.
[00:16:21.229 --> 00:16:25.093]  Well, the 7th Amendment says that we get jury trials if it's a civil action.
[00:16:25.573 --> 00:16:29.156]  If it's over $20, and this is way over $20.
[00:16:29.497 --> 00:16:32.740]  And they're saying here that under that law, that they presume to have the authority,
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:48.427]  Every federal agency, not just the EPA, every federal agency has the authority to conduct administrative wage garnishment provided that the agency adopts approved rules for conducting hearings where debtors can challenge the amount of debt or repayment schedule.
[00:16:49.167 --> 00:16:50.828]  These hearings are not trials.
[00:16:51.368 --> 00:16:53.610]  They're not jury trials of your peers.
[00:16:54.050 --> 00:17:03.915]  This is an administrative hearing before the same agency that created the rules, before the same agency that polices the rules, that assesses the fines.
[00:17:04.296 --> 00:17:06.057]  They're going to listen to you.
[00:17:06.077 --> 00:17:15.282]  This is not a trial by your peers, where if it's an unreasonable law, like this one from the EPA, the jury should nullify that law.
[00:17:15.422 --> 00:17:17.103]  That's why we have juries.
[00:17:17.463 --> 00:17:20.876]  is to nullify those kind of laws so they're throwing out
[00:17:21.986 --> 00:17:25.948]  A tradition that is enshrined in our Constitution.
[00:17:25.988 --> 00:17:27.389]  Where does that tradition come from?
[00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:29.610]  Well, it goes all the way back to the Magna Carta.
[00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:32.291]  We used to lead the world in liberty.
[00:17:32.391 --> 00:17:34.132]  Now we're leading the world in tyranny.
[00:17:34.172 --> 00:17:39.235]  Because we can see that in the UK, they are now adopting these same tactics there.
[00:17:39.635 --> 00:17:43.017]  And the members of Parliament are horrified that this is happening.
[00:17:43.297 --> 00:17:47.239]  This is a story that was put up from the International Business Times on Infowars.
[00:17:47.819 --> 00:17:56.404]  UK MPs are horrified by the HMRC, that's their IRS, overriding the Magna Carta by raiding bank accounts.
[00:17:56.444 --> 00:18:03.589]  Yes, they're going to go in and just confiscate money out of the bank accounts like the IRS has been doing here for decades.
[00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:06.330]  And of course, this is something that goes back 800 years.
[00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:07.111]  As they point out,
[00:18:07.711 --> 00:18:17.939]  Britain's tax man is going to be taking money directly out of bank accounts without a court order, and that breaches the 800-year-old protection of ordinary people that's inscribed in the Magna Carta.
[00:18:18.459 --> 00:18:32.871]  MPs said that they were horrified by these proposals, said, we're talking about the ability of one organ of the state to have the unique right to go against the Magna Carta charter, go in and seize without judicial process or review a bank account.
[00:18:33.371 --> 00:18:34.532]  Well, yes, that's right.
[00:18:34.612 --> 00:18:42.158]  And if they let this stand, it's going to be like it is here in the United States, where it isn't going to be one unique agency like the IRS.
[00:18:42.518 --> 00:18:47.782]  After they do that for a few years, they will extend it to all of the bureaucracies of the government.
[00:18:48.102 --> 00:18:56.188]  When you allow them to usurp your rights, to steal them, when they are guaranteed by our documents, like the Magna Carta, by the Constitution.
[00:18:56.208 --> 00:18:57.930]  The Constitution didn't give us our rights.
[00:18:58.530 --> 00:18:59.692]  Neither did the Magna Carta.
[00:18:59.712 --> 00:19:04.618]  What they did was they recognized that we have those rights and that governments will not take them.
[00:19:05.519 --> 00:19:08.282]  This is a quote that one of the MPs in the UK mentioned.
[00:19:08.342 --> 00:19:10.064]  It's from Prime Minister William Pitt.
[00:19:10.104 --> 00:19:13.468]  Now, he was there at the time of the American Revolution.
[00:19:14.403 --> 00:19:19.585]  He stood with the American colonies against what the Crown was doing to the American colonies.
[00:19:19.885 --> 00:19:25.147]  He said this, he said, necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom.
[00:19:25.207 --> 00:19:27.288]  That was the quote that they brought up in the debate.
[00:19:27.648 --> 00:19:29.349]  They always tell us that it's necessary.
[00:19:29.709 --> 00:19:42.234]  And what they're telling us with the EPA, what they're telling them in UK is that, well, it's efficient, it's necessary that we do this because we don't want to spend too much time or too much money in these collections.
[00:19:43.288 --> 00:19:48.152]  There's other things that are going on with British politicians, and they're also saying that this is necessary as well.
[00:19:48.192 --> 00:19:49.593]  This is a story from Steve Watson.
[00:19:49.633 --> 00:19:56.959]  He points out that British politicians have been caught in a secret deal to allow the mass surveillance of the public.
[00:19:57.519 --> 00:20:02.123]  This is a done deal, he says, between the three parties, and it's going to be railroaded through.
[00:20:02.183 --> 00:20:04.584]  That's a quote from a prominent member of Parliament.
[00:20:05.425 --> 00:20:07.686]  This is being exposed by the Open Rights Group.
[00:20:07.726 --> 00:20:13.147]  They say there is no legal basis for making internet service providers retain our data.
[00:20:13.647 --> 00:20:17.788]  So it's using the threat of terrorism as an excuse for getting this law passed.
[00:20:17.828 --> 00:20:26.951]  Now the Prime Minister, David Cameron, says, I'll be explaining today why emergency legislation is needed to maintain powers to help keep us safe.
[00:20:26.991 --> 00:20:28.231]  See, it's necessary.
[00:20:28.871 --> 00:20:42.284]  But this group points out that the government has had since April to address the European Court of Justice ruling, but it is only now that organizations such as the Open Rights Group is threatening legal action that this has become an emergency.
[00:20:42.304 --> 00:20:51.133]  Steve Watson also points out in the article that the UK is mirroring what the US is doing in terms of dragnet surveillance of the entire population.
[00:20:51.474 --> 00:20:52.595]  But of course there's a reason for that.
[00:20:52.995 --> 00:21:02.343]  Not only are we leading the way now in tyranny, but we have a formal organization called the Five Eyes, and the UK is one of the key members of that organization.
[00:21:02.684 --> 00:21:03.685]  Just look at this story.
[00:21:03.925 --> 00:21:09.229]  Files on the UK's role in CIA rendition have been accidentally destroyed.
[00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:11.552]  Now, of course, this is to Diego Garcia.
[00:21:11.992 --> 00:21:15.155]  It's a UK territory, but it's an open secret.
[00:21:15.515 --> 00:21:20.019]  That the CIA has been using that for rendition and for torture and for various other uses.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.222]  When they found out about this, they tried to get information.
[00:21:23.242 --> 00:21:25.524]  This is a human rights group in the UK.
[00:21:25.564 --> 00:21:30.649]  Of course, they get the same excuse that we hear over here all the time from the IRS and other people.
[00:21:31.169 --> 00:21:32.450]  The dog ate it, essentially.
[00:21:32.531 --> 00:21:33.712]  They've lost this now.
[00:21:33.792 --> 00:21:36.114]  It's been destroyed because of water exposure.
[00:21:37.079 --> 00:21:46.693]  Now, even as that's happening, the NSA and now DARPA are moving further and further into control and manipulation through the Internet.
[00:21:46.773 --> 00:21:49.697]  As they watch what we're doing, they're also controlling us.
[00:21:49.757 --> 00:21:53.001]  And of course, one of the ways that they watch and control us is through social media.
[00:21:53.482 --> 00:22:02.731]  We reported just last week that there was an unannounced experiment on Facebook to try to make people happier or more depressed by controlling their news feed.
[00:22:03.152 --> 00:22:08.216]  Now we see that there are literally dozens of military programs to control social media.
[00:22:08.517 --> 00:22:10.819]  This is a story by Steve Watson up on Infowars.com.
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:23.568]  And he says that reporters in the London Guardian reveal that DARPA is engaging in multiple programs targeting Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Kickstarter and other popular social media sites.
[00:22:24.109 --> 00:22:37.038]  Now the website that's talking about this DARPA program says that they are seeking to develop tools to support the efforts of human operators to counter misinformation or deception campaigns with truthful information.
[00:22:37.078 --> 00:22:38.399]  Of course, Steve Watson points out
[00:22:38.999 --> 00:22:42.642]  What they consider to be truthful information is merely propaganda.
[00:22:42.982 --> 00:22:44.624]  And let's show you how that works.
[00:22:45.064 --> 00:22:56.193]  Again, quoting from the study, they say, for example, a government campaign on Twitter that supports vaccinations can engage with followers who are more likely to take certain actions.
[00:22:56.253 --> 00:22:59.796]  For example, spreading a campaign message based on their opinions.
[00:23:00.136 --> 00:23:07.542]  And when anti-government messages are spread in social media, the government would want to spread counter-messages to balance that effort.
[00:23:07.822 --> 00:23:14.546]  Hence, identify people who are more likely to spread such counter messages based on their opinions.
[00:23:14.986 --> 00:23:18.068]  Now, that's a quote from the people who wrote the study.
[00:23:18.708 --> 00:23:26.713]  They're talking about how they're going to use social media to control people that they know will be their own personal trolls.
[00:23:26.733 --> 00:23:27.153]  That's right.
[00:23:27.553 --> 00:23:30.555]  DARPA is looking for a few good trolls.
[00:23:31.315 --> 00:23:32.176]  And how are they doing it?
[00:23:32.216 --> 00:23:36.978]  They're doing it through a grant to mainly IBM and universities.
[00:23:37.018 --> 00:23:44.143]  They're giving $8.9 million to IBM and $9.6 million to educational institutions.
[00:23:44.183 --> 00:23:47.705]  Remember how Eisenhower warned us about the military-industrial complex?
[00:23:48.345 --> 00:23:56.593]  Well, he also talked about how all research would be taken over by that military-industrial complex to serve the government's interests.
[00:23:56.653 --> 00:24:01.677]  I can think of no better example of that than this DARPA troll research that's going on.
[00:24:02.258 --> 00:24:05.401]  Now, a lot of people are having enough of this surveillance state.
[00:24:05.521 --> 00:24:09.565]  Germany has just ejected the CIA Station Chief at the U.S.
[00:24:09.605 --> 00:24:10.425]  Embassy in Berlin.
[00:24:10.446 --> 00:24:12.467]  They've asked him to leave the country.
[00:24:13.248 --> 00:24:16.311]  The official spokesman said, the representative of the U.S.
[00:24:16.351 --> 00:24:18.452]  intelligence services at the embassy of the U.S.
[00:24:18.913 --> 00:24:21.295]  has been requested to leave Germany.
[00:24:21.775 --> 00:24:26.419]  And that brings up the question, why don't we arrest the people who are spying on us?
[00:24:26.459 --> 00:24:28.140]  It's not against the law for the U.S.
[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:31.323]  government to spy on Germany, even though Germany is their allies.
[00:24:31.743 --> 00:24:40.050]  But it is against the law, the FISA law, that was enacted after the Frank Church Committee hearings, where they were concerned that our own government
[00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:41.011]  We're good to go.
[00:24:55.644 --> 00:24:59.406]  An idea that he could remotely control contraceptives.
[00:24:59.766 --> 00:25:01.928]  This is from the MIT Technology Review.
[00:25:02.348 --> 00:25:10.812]  They say a contraceptive implant with remote control could be deactivated and reactivated using a wireless remote control.
[00:25:10.853 --> 00:25:12.413]  This would be implanted under the skin.
[00:25:12.794 --> 00:25:18.697]  It would dispense 30 micrograms a day of a hormone that's already used in a lot of different contraceptives.
[00:25:19.117 --> 00:25:23.680]  And they would put 16 years of that hormone in this device.
[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:26.041]  What could possibly go wrong?
[00:25:26.841 --> 00:25:39.106]  Well, first of all, I don't know what the consequences would be if you got 16 years worth of contraceptive hormone all at once because there was a malfunction in the device, or it ruptured, or it was exploded in an accident.
[00:25:39.747 --> 00:25:44.649]  But the other question is, who's going to control this remote control contraceptive device?
[00:25:45.356 --> 00:25:57.906]  As we look at the Internet of Things, as we have appliances throughout our houses that are hooked into the Internet, that can be hacked into, isn't it possible that this device could be hacked into as well?
[00:25:57.946 --> 00:25:58.607]  Of course it is!
[00:25:59.507 --> 00:26:12.478]  And the question that we have to ask ourselves is, how are we turning control over our lives, even over when we're going to have children, to outside parties, when we make it available for them to turn that on?
[00:26:13.098 --> 00:26:17.961]  Very dangerous that you would not know when it's being turned on or by who it's being turned on.
[00:26:18.442 --> 00:26:24.165]  Now, of course, it's also no surprise that this will be coming from Bill Gates with his connections back to Planned Parenthood.
[00:26:24.205 --> 00:26:27.387]  His father was president of Planned Parenthood for a very long time.
[00:26:27.768 --> 00:26:30.729]  The goal, they say, is to have this on the market by 2018.
[00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:33.331]  Now, stay with us.
[00:26:33.391 --> 00:26:39.975]  Right after the break, we have the InfoWars crew in Murrieta, California, and an interview with some La Raza members.
[00:26:40.036 --> 00:26:40.516]  Stay with us.
[00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:53.353]  Alex Jones here to break down some exciting developments in the area of research concerning supplemental iodine.
[00:26:53.993 --> 00:26:56.134]  It's nothing less than phenomenal.
[00:26:56.714 --> 00:27:02.937]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:27:03.237 --> 00:27:07.220]  And I used some of the mainline iodine supplements and they upset my stomach and I had some issues with it.
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:18.007]  Until I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group, who I was already interviewing as an expert on my radio show, and I began taking the product before he actually rolled it out.
[00:27:18.467 --> 00:27:23.771]  You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:27:24.511 --> 00:27:32.316]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:27:33.357 --> 00:27:43.300]  That are incredibly powerful that no one else has as a source for their iodine from between 7 and 12,000 feet literally drilled out of the ground.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:48.941]  You put it on a hot plate and it turns into the pure gas.
[00:27:49.142 --> 00:27:51.622]  No one else has 99.99% pure iodine.
[00:27:53.803 --> 00:27:57.624]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:27:58.244 --> 00:27:59.745]  I was over 270 pounds.
[00:28:01.525 --> 00:28:10.571]  And with the iodine, exercise, and better diet, I have lost now more than 50 pounds total and I'm continuing to lose the weight.
[00:28:10.912 --> 00:28:15.055]  I have more energy, my libido, all this crap came out of my skin.
[00:28:15.595 --> 00:28:17.056]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:28:17.076 --> 00:28:18.457]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:28:18.717 --> 00:28:19.858]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:28:20.378 --> 00:28:21.079]  Nobody else.
[00:28:21.499 --> 00:28:25.142]  ...has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:25.482 --> 00:28:26.363]  This is innovating.
[00:28:26.764 --> 00:28:27.784]  This is trailblazing.
[00:28:28.205 --> 00:28:35.511]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:28:35.731 --> 00:28:39.475]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:28:40.015 --> 00:28:45.420]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:57.924]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com in Murrieta, California.
[00:28:58.345 --> 00:29:06.713]  Now right behind me, on both sides of the road, we have La Raza soldiers standing their little guard, waving Mexican flags back and forth.
[00:29:07.014 --> 00:29:12.359]  I want to go down there and talk to them and see what they have to say, hear what their views are on this matter.
[00:29:12.619 --> 00:29:13.841]  Let's go down there and take a look.
[00:29:14.349 --> 00:29:17.111]  What is your stand then on how to deal with it?
[00:29:17.752 --> 00:29:19.153]  Well, you know, I don't know the answers.
[00:29:19.173 --> 00:29:20.033]  I don't know the answers.
[00:29:20.053 --> 00:29:21.154]  I mean, just your personal opinion.
[00:29:21.174 --> 00:29:25.558]  But I do know that, you know, everyone has the right to protest.
[00:29:25.598 --> 00:29:27.159]  That's right, you know.
[00:29:27.199 --> 00:29:28.320]  That's fine, you know.
[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:33.163]  But, you know, scaring children, just, that's not right.
[00:29:33.203 --> 00:29:35.325]  So are you guys going to take in these kids as well?
[00:29:35.825 --> 00:29:37.587]  If, if, if, if these kids,
[00:29:39.002 --> 00:29:42.463]  If they release them, I'll tell you right in the center of town.
[00:29:42.483 --> 00:29:44.684]  They can come to my house.
[00:29:44.744 --> 00:29:51.527]  I went to the Pro Amnesty meeting yesterday at Town Hall and the Diocese said that they will be releasing them into the city.
[00:29:51.547 --> 00:29:53.908]  Would you take them into my home?
[00:29:53.928 --> 00:29:55.829]  Yes, I would take them into my home.
[00:29:55.949 --> 00:29:56.749]  I don't even live here.
[00:29:56.769 --> 00:29:57.630]  But see, that's a personal.
[00:29:57.650 --> 00:29:59.130]  You're asking me what I personally would do?
[00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.710]  Yes, I would.
[00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:00.751]  Well, that's what I want to know.
[00:30:07.979 --> 00:30:11.122]  You've got people like Nancy Pelosi and all these people who say they're going to bring kids.
[00:30:11.142 --> 00:30:12.303]  No one's doing it.
[00:30:12.463 --> 00:30:17.968]  Those people are doing it and making big statements, you know, so everybody can hear and this and that, and they're not doing it.
[00:30:18.268 --> 00:30:22.452]  Well, tell us, you know, right now where they're being released at.
[00:30:22.632 --> 00:30:24.593]  And I'll tell you right now, they keep releasing them.
[00:30:24.613 --> 00:30:30.939]  Well, from what I heard last night, like I said, from the diocese when he spoke at the rally up there, he said they should be getting released from them.
[00:30:30.979 --> 00:30:32.600]  Well, see, I don't know about him.
[00:30:33.921 --> 00:30:35.944]  Well, I didn't know when I heard they had a big rally.
[00:30:36.024 --> 00:30:36.605]  No, I was there.
[00:30:36.625 --> 00:30:36.785]  Yeah.
[00:30:36.825 --> 00:30:36.865]  No.
[00:30:49.241 --> 00:30:50.262]  Well, yeah, I know.
[00:30:50.322 --> 00:30:50.642]  I know.
[00:30:50.722 --> 00:30:57.268]  So, so how can, how can we sit here and discuss about, but what would you do if, if, we don't know because they're not giving us any information anyway.
[00:30:57.288 --> 00:30:58.169]  Yeah, but you have to plan for the end.
[00:30:58.209 --> 00:30:59.190]  So, so that's irrelevant?
[00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:01.732]  Well, we can plan all we want, but it's not happening.
[00:31:01.772 --> 00:31:06.436]  What's happening now is that we saw on the news that they rushed a bus with kids.
[00:31:06.937 --> 00:31:11.321]  And that's, that's, that's the only part that we have to know about is that, you know,
[00:31:12.862 --> 00:31:14.483]  They're already detained.
[00:31:14.704 --> 00:31:20.188]  I can understand, you know, if they were not kids, and yeah, you guys have the right to protest and say whatever you guys want.
[00:31:20.649 --> 00:31:21.149]  So do we.
[00:31:21.689 --> 00:31:25.613]  But the point of the matter, and the only reason we're here, is because they were kids.
[00:31:26.313 --> 00:31:26.834]  And that's it.
[00:31:27.214 --> 00:31:32.959]  Well, the thing is, you know, it's not like these kids were on purposely coming over here to do something malicious.
[00:31:32.979 --> 00:31:34.340]  Like, oh, I'm gonna, you know.
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.482]  But the families, but the families.
[00:31:36.522 --> 00:31:37.543]  That's the families.
[00:31:37.583 --> 00:31:38.283]  Are the families here?
[00:31:40.345 --> 00:31:41.806]  Not yet, that's the plan.
[00:31:41.926 --> 00:31:44.987]  Okay, well if that is, that's out of our control, is it?
[00:31:45.247 --> 00:31:46.568]  Is it out of your control?
[00:31:46.708 --> 00:31:48.829]  Yeah, but I'm saying, are you going to stop it though?
[00:31:48.849 --> 00:31:50.249]  Here you can stop it, you can't stop it here.
[00:31:50.729 --> 00:31:53.170]  Coming here and attacking that bus is not going to stop that.
[00:31:53.531 --> 00:31:56.772]  See, that's my point, is that you're not going to stop it by doing that action.
[00:31:57.432 --> 00:31:59.073]  All that did was just create a big old thing.
[00:31:59.093 --> 00:32:00.353]  Well, we got to stop the catch and release.
[00:32:00.373 --> 00:32:01.334]  But it didn't do nothing.
[00:32:02.194 --> 00:32:05.397]  Like I said, point blank, they're already detained.
[00:32:05.897 --> 00:32:10.501]  It's not like they were walking down the street and you said, hey, don't come over here on this side of this barbed wire fence.
[00:32:10.981 --> 00:32:12.042]  That's not what's going on here.
[00:32:12.122 --> 00:32:18.126]  They're already detained by, you know, law enforcement or immigration, right?
[00:32:18.266 --> 00:32:19.607]  They're already detained.
[00:32:19.627 --> 00:32:25.452]  So, you know, if you guys want to do something about that, then go and talk to the immigration department, right?
[00:32:25.492 --> 00:32:26.332]  Isn't that an issue with ICE?
[00:32:27.473 --> 00:32:29.275]  Well, they've been put on furlough.
[00:32:29.315 --> 00:32:30.636]  They've been put on furlough.
[00:32:30.656 --> 00:32:31.737]  It's not people walking around.
[00:32:31.797 --> 00:32:32.498]  See what I mean?
[00:32:32.518 --> 00:32:38.424]  The Obama administration put them on furlough so they don't have to do their job so more people can come through.
[00:32:38.944 --> 00:32:41.166]  What I'm saying is this.
[00:32:41.447 --> 00:32:43.729]  Whatever happened here was not the way to change anything.
[00:32:43.829 --> 00:32:44.890]  Because they didn't do nothing.
[00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:46.391]  And it didn't change anything.
[00:32:46.471 --> 00:32:48.793]  It diverted some things, but it's still going to happen somewhere else.
[00:32:48.813 --> 00:32:49.975]  Thank you for your opinion.
[00:32:51.636 --> 00:32:52.457]  Well, there you have it.
[00:32:52.557 --> 00:32:54.519]  That's LaRosa's opinion on the matter.
[00:32:54.799 --> 00:32:59.703]  When we first rode by though, I rolled down the window as I drove by and I said, hey, do you mind if we get out and talk to you?
[00:32:59.723 --> 00:33:00.444]  And he said, no.
[00:33:00.844 --> 00:33:09.773]  But once I got out and I was able to, you know, show them that I didn't have a microphone in my hand, the guy became a little bit more loose, a little bit more comfortable and able to talk.
[00:33:10.213 --> 00:33:12.395]  And then we were able to get this interview out there for you.
[00:33:12.715 --> 00:33:15.598]  And as you can see, everybody has their own opinion on this matter.
[00:33:15.918 --> 00:33:17.560]  It may not be right, but hey,
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.226]  That's their opinion I guess.
[00:33:19.668 --> 00:33:21.136]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com
[00:33:23.131 --> 00:33:24.391]  Well, that's it for tonight's news.

[00:35:16.513 --> 00:35:20.858]  How do you feel about the treatment of Infowars compared to Fox Media and the double standard?
[00:35:21.379 --> 00:35:23.461]  Them bugging their eyes out at them and puffing their chests.
[00:35:23.621 --> 00:35:25.744]  Yeah, they bow up to them.
[00:35:25.944 --> 00:35:26.885]  It's typical.
[00:35:26.905 --> 00:35:31.030]  If you're not part of the lamestream media, you're discriminated against.
[00:35:31.191 --> 00:35:31.791]  That's right.
[00:35:33.853 --> 00:35:36.414]  They don't want anything to do with alternative media because they tell the truth.
[00:35:36.434 --> 00:35:36.694]  You know?
[00:35:36.754 --> 00:35:37.774]  Conspiracy theorists.
[00:35:37.794 --> 00:35:39.115]  They question known liars.
[00:35:39.195 --> 00:35:39.715]  Exactly.
[00:35:40.175 --> 00:35:40.496]  Amen.
[00:35:41.116 --> 00:35:45.898]  What do you think about what just happened with the police bullying InfoWars and all that?
[00:35:46.018 --> 00:35:47.779]  They should be bullying that border instead of this.
[00:35:47.819 --> 00:35:48.259]  Look at this.
[00:35:48.319 --> 00:35:48.799]  Yeah.
[00:35:48.819 --> 00:35:54.442]  About probably 20, 24% of the people here have nobody there.
[00:35:54.462 --> 00:35:54.902]  That's right.
[00:35:55.642 --> 00:35:56.283]  Are you a racist?
[00:35:57.203 --> 00:35:57.504]  Of course!
[00:35:57.584 --> 00:35:58.084]  Of course!
[00:35:58.344 --> 00:35:59.626]  Wait, are you a brown though?
[00:35:59.826 --> 00:36:00.246]  Exactly.
[00:36:00.266 --> 00:36:02.448]  What do they call this stuff?
[00:36:02.468 --> 00:36:02.889]  Coconut.
[00:36:02.929 --> 00:36:03.409]  Coconut.
[00:36:03.769 --> 00:36:05.051]  That's what La Raza called me the other day.
[00:36:05.071 --> 00:36:06.792]  You know, and look at this.
[00:36:06.812 --> 00:36:07.973]  They came in enforcement.
[00:36:08.314 --> 00:36:10.135]  They brought K-9 units.
[00:36:10.196 --> 00:36:11.457]  They brought undercovers.
[00:36:11.497 --> 00:36:11.797]  For who?
[00:36:12.077 --> 00:36:12.518]  Patriots?
[00:36:13.499 --> 00:36:15.941]  Just for news people trying to ask questions about the troops.
[00:36:16.081 --> 00:36:16.622]  Real questions?
[00:36:16.722 --> 00:36:17.663]  Real questions.
[00:36:18.223 --> 00:36:18.744]  That's what I thought.
[00:36:21.613 --> 00:36:25.274]  This border should look like this.
[00:36:25.674 --> 00:36:27.154]  They got a better gate than the border does.
[00:36:27.754 --> 00:36:27.934]  Exactly.
[00:36:28.074 --> 00:36:29.515]  They left the fences wide open.
[00:36:30.515 --> 00:36:32.555]  You got InfoWars here.
[00:36:32.575 --> 00:36:33.956]  They're just trying to get the truth out there.
[00:36:33.976 --> 00:36:35.376]  They're trying to ask real questions.
[00:36:35.616 --> 00:36:36.016]  Right.
[00:36:36.216 --> 00:36:37.756]  Ask over there.
[00:36:37.816 --> 00:36:38.617]  We got Fox.
[00:36:38.637 --> 00:36:40.457]  They got a script to run off of.
[00:36:40.557 --> 00:36:40.777]  Yep.
[00:36:40.797 --> 00:36:41.397]  Talking points.
[00:36:41.877 --> 00:36:42.497]  Exactly.
[00:36:42.677 --> 00:36:43.397]  And lookit.
[00:36:43.417 --> 00:36:45.778]  They're just... They're just harassers right now.
[00:36:45.798 --> 00:36:47.558]  They're trying to get the truth out.
[00:36:47.758 --> 00:36:48.839]  They bucked their eyes out at him.
[00:36:48.859 --> 00:36:49.759]  They puffed their chest.
[00:36:50.099 --> 00:36:50.299]  You know.
[00:36:51.288 --> 00:36:51.989]  They're out of control.
[00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:52.849]  Exactly.
[00:37:00.956 --> 00:37:11.746]  Ladies and gentlemen, Carmageddon was supposed to happen out in LA a few years ago when they shut down one of the major highways for half a day to fix a bridge.
[00:37:12.406 --> 00:37:17.831]  No, ladies and gentlemen, Carmageddon didn't happen.
[00:37:19.798 --> 00:37:21.479]  In L.A., it's happened here in Austin.
[00:37:21.979 --> 00:37:23.720]  Obama has been here since yesterday.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.781]  David Knight for InfoWars.com.
[00:37:25.861 --> 00:37:29.584]  Now, just behind me is the house of Director Robert Rodriguez.
[00:37:30.144 --> 00:37:39.509]  This is where an Obama fundraiser is going to take place later tonight, charging people anywhere from $5,000 to $32,000 to meet Obama.
[00:37:40.029 --> 00:37:43.972]  There are two fundraisers taking place in Texas, one in Dallas, one here in Austin.
[00:37:44.412 --> 00:37:48.054]  But of course, Obama is not going to go anywhere near the border.
[00:37:48.414 --> 00:37:52.157]  He's not paying attention to this humanitarian crisis.
[00:37:52.217 --> 00:38:05.887]  If you ask, and I've talked to some of my border community leaders, they're very, very upset that he can drink a beer, he can play pool, but he doesn't have time to travel 242 miles from Austin down to the border.
[00:38:05.987 --> 00:38:08.229]  And there has been non-stop traffic.
[00:38:08.649 --> 00:38:12.872]  I-35 northbound, southbound blocked, southbound this morning, northbound now.
[00:38:13.353 --> 00:38:14.554]  We had a guest that was
[00:38:15.454 --> 00:38:24.487]  Gonna be coming into studio and then a landline and can't even probably come on air because they can't get out of downtown because Obama was there this morning.
[00:38:25.342 --> 00:38:31.047]  The entire city is basically paralyzed with 20 miles of traffic backed up.
[00:38:31.467 --> 00:38:42.116]  We have a local news report here where he's out in Manor from about an hour ago with it backed up 20 miles into Austin.
[00:38:42.216 --> 00:38:43.417]  We gotta go shoot video of this.
[00:38:44.317 --> 00:38:46.960]  20 miles of the traffic not
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:48.181]  Moving.
[00:38:48.501 --> 00:38:49.862]  And look, the cops are all over.
[00:38:49.902 --> 00:38:50.563]  I saw it this morning.
[00:38:50.863 --> 00:38:51.784]  He'd already left town.
[00:38:51.804 --> 00:38:57.148]  They were just randomly blocking mixmasters and highways just as some act of power.
[00:38:58.129 --> 00:38:59.490]  And that's what all of this is.
[00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:02.693]  It's just a total domination of the American people.
[00:39:02.973 --> 00:39:06.596]  Let's play the audio from some of that newscast.
[00:39:06.636 --> 00:39:10.640]  And then I shot some video on my iPhone this morning of the traffic cams.
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:23.888]  You know, that they have, where it just showed nothing moving on I-35 at 8am through 9.30, southbound, with them just blocking, waiting for him.
[00:39:23.908 --> 00:39:29.671]  And then when he goes through, like he's God, while he goes around fundraising.
[00:39:30.912 --> 00:39:34.114]  And again, it gets worse and worse and worse, but he won't go to the border.
[00:39:34.694 --> 00:39:35.795]  Let's go ahead and go to that report.
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:38.641]  Welcome back to KXAN News at Noon.
[00:39:38.661 --> 00:39:50.068]  We are taking a live picture of State Highway 71 and the tollway 130 and the traffic back up there is a parking lot just outside of the airport near the Del Valle area.
[00:39:50.668 --> 00:39:56.512]  A year ago, ladies and gentlemen, but again I want to show the ones that I shot on my iPhone today.
[00:39:57.792 --> 00:40:00.434]  And again we actually have video of that.
[00:40:03.465 --> 00:40:07.909]  And again, they literally shut down the highways to do this.
[00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:20.100]  And again, we finally did get some shots up there showing the completely open highway for hours so that Obama could drive down it.
[00:40:20.521 --> 00:40:27.968]  And again, even after he was gone, even after he had left and wasn't even in the city anymore,
[00:40:29.414 --> 00:40:32.297]  They still just kept it shut an hour later when I drove to work.
[00:40:33.819 --> 00:40:37.003]  I think they should permanently just close the road because he drove on it.
[00:40:37.043 --> 00:40:37.563]  I'm serious.
[00:40:37.984 --> 00:40:44.211]  Like they used to take the wives of Viking kings and their children and burn them on a ship with his body.
[00:40:44.571 --> 00:40:47.474]  Why not blow the whole earth up just to honor Obama?
[00:40:47.875 --> 00:40:48.435]  I'm serious.
[00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:53.832]  How about some child sacrifice, like line the road with aborted babies?
[00:40:53.852 --> 00:40:54.972]  I mean, that's what they're into anyways.
[00:40:55.673 --> 00:40:59.354]  I guess they already heat hospitals with dead babies' bodies and Pepsi's baby-flavored.
[00:40:59.394 --> 00:40:59.815]  Why not?
[00:41:00.135 --> 00:41:04.817]  See, the maximum satire I can come up with, they're involved in.
[00:41:05.981 --> 00:41:23.131]  And then they have Democratic Party websites make fun of me for saying Caligula married his horse and the elites become corrupt and decadent, knowing how ignorant their audience is, preying on the pseudo-fake bloated intellectuals who have five degrees and can't get jobs and are total failures and love it.
[00:41:31.693 --> 00:41:35.495]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[00:41:35.915 --> 00:41:37.116]  I didn't, I taste dirt in it.
[00:41:37.176 --> 00:41:38.296]  God knows what's in this.
[00:41:38.436 --> 00:41:39.437]  This has an aftertaste.
[00:41:39.457 --> 00:41:41.038]  Tastes like Austin water?
[00:41:41.318 --> 00:41:41.758]  Yeah, it does.
[00:41:41.958 --> 00:41:42.178]  Ugh.
[00:41:42.218 --> 00:41:46.380]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:52.683]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered through the ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[00:41:52.703 --> 00:41:53.704]  High quality H2O.
[00:41:53.804 --> 00:41:55.244]  That one is better.
[00:41:55.324 --> 00:41:56.285]  Tastes like nothing.
[00:41:56.585 --> 00:41:57.986]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[00:41:58.046 --> 00:41:58.546]  It's good water.
[00:41:58.646 --> 00:42:07.195]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, Monsanto's deadly pesticide, glyphosate, and many others.
[00:42:07.595 --> 00:42:15.103]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[00:42:15.383 --> 00:42:17.886]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[00:42:18.446 --> 00:42:20.808]  Yeah, it has that processed flavor to it.
[00:42:21.149 --> 00:42:30.717]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances and many more, leaving only fresh tasting, deliciously clean water.
[00:42:30.737 --> 00:42:32.478]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[00:42:32.558 --> 00:42:33.239]  It's good water.
[00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:34.361]  Refreshing.
[00:42:34.801 --> 00:42:35.262]  It's good!
