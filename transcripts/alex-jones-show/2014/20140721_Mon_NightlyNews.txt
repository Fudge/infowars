[00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.271]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.371 --> 00:00:22.811]  It's Monday, July 21st, 2014.
[00:00:23.931 --> 00:00:26.292]  I'm David Knight, and here are our top stories.
[00:00:29.213 --> 00:00:35.115]  Tonight, Border Patrol agents are kept in the dark about recent cartel violence.
[00:00:36.252 --> 00:00:40.316]  Then, what you're not being told about Flight MH17.
[00:00:41.077 --> 00:00:44.301]  And Verizon makes it trendy to surrender your privacy.
[00:00:44.681 --> 00:00:48.045]  That's next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:58.223 --> 00:01:05.170]  Now, if mainstream media was not functioning in a purely propaganda mode, it would be asking the typical kind of questions that you ask in journalism.
[00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.870]  Who?
[00:01:06.071 --> 00:01:06.371]  What?
[00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:06.991]  Where?
[00:01:07.111 --> 00:01:07.412]  Why?
[00:01:07.932 --> 00:01:11.656]  Now, we immediately got some implausible answers about who.
[00:01:12.236 --> 00:01:18.002]  We were told what it was, and although that was reasonable that it was a Buk missile system, we were not shown any photographs.
[00:01:18.022 --> 00:01:21.605]  We're going to have some stories about that later on, but the real question is,
[00:01:22.486 --> 00:01:25.127]  Why was the airplane where it was?
[00:01:25.207 --> 00:01:32.730]  Now, earlier today on the Alex Jones Radio Show, he took some calls from airline pilots and air traffic controllers, and they raised these same questions.
[00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.110]  And we're going to have a report about that at the end of the show.
[00:01:35.631 --> 00:01:36.431]  But let's remember...
[00:01:37.386 --> 00:01:49.653]  That it wasn't just that this flight MH17 was over a Ukrainian war zone, it was also the height that it was told to fly by the Ukrainian air traffic controllers.
[00:01:50.153 --> 00:01:55.456]  It was requested, after they put it into that airspace, to fly at only 35,000 feet.
[00:01:55.856 --> 00:02:04.281]  Then they were told to go lower to 33,000 feet, which was right at the level that the European controllers had warned people not to go below.
[00:02:04.301 --> 00:02:04.721]  And of course,
[00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:13.447]  The FAA had given hard prohibitions to all American airlines and American pilots, and now we see something even more bizarre in Syria.
[00:02:13.507 --> 00:02:15.929]  This also involves a Malaysian airliner.
[00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:18.911]  It was diverted over Syrian airspace.
[00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:25.476]  Now on Robert Perry's site, ConsortiumNews.com, this is the question that he says his source raised to him.
[00:02:25.516 --> 00:02:31.400]  He said, the dog not barking question, and that's a Sherlock Holmes analogy of course, on the catastrophe over the Ukraine is,
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.841]  What did the U.S.
[00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:34.782]  surveillance satellite imagery show?
[00:02:35.262 --> 00:02:37.484]  It's hard to believe that with the attention of the U.S.
[00:02:37.504 --> 00:02:49.671]  intelligence concentrated on eastern Ukraine for the past half year, that the alleged trucking of several large Buk anti-aircraft missile systems from Russia to the Ukraine, then back to Russia, didn't show up somewhere.
[00:02:49.691 --> 00:02:55.715]  And he points out that the Buk missiles are about 16 feet long, they're trucked around on large trucks or on top of tanks.
[00:02:56.135 --> 00:03:04.417]  And then he asked the question, how can the Washington Post run front page stories, like the one it did on Sunday, which gives a definitive title, the U.S.
[00:03:04.577 --> 00:03:06.917]  official says that Russia gave these systems.
[00:03:06.937 --> 00:03:10.738]  He says, how can they do that without demanding from these same U.S.
[00:03:10.778 --> 00:03:14.338]  officials details about what the satellite images, the U.S.
[00:03:14.358 --> 00:03:15.659]  satellite images disclose?
[00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:18.779]  In other words, they would see these large systems.
[00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:23.480]  And if they're making these claims, clearly they have some pictures to back this up.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.604]  We even got pictures before Iraq, or after Iraq, when we were being lied to about that.
[00:03:28.964 --> 00:03:32.086]  And then he points out this interesting revelation from his source.
[00:03:32.627 --> 00:03:45.697]  He says, there was also a suggestion from the source that the soldiers involved were undisciplined, possibly drunk, and possibly Ukrainian, since the imagery showed what looked like beer bottles scattered around the site.
[00:03:46.477 --> 00:03:49.240]  See, it's so detailed that they can see the beer bottles.
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.726]  Actually, it's probably so detailed with today's satellite imagery, they could tell you what brand of beer they were drinking.
[00:03:55.786 --> 00:04:02.192]  But we don't see any pictures of what we're told shot it down or people who did shoot it down.
[00:04:02.232 --> 00:04:04.154]  We believe that they would have those images.
[00:04:05.255 --> 00:04:15.546]  Reputable sources like the Washington Post are basically putting out the talking points in a propagandistic way, saying that we know this is true, and yet they haven't vetted those sources.
[00:04:15.826 --> 00:04:17.428]  We haven't seen the satellite images.
[00:04:17.908 --> 00:04:23.974]  We do have some photographic evidence, however, that shows that the Ukraine regime was delivering Buk missiles to troops.
[00:04:24.074 --> 00:04:27.137]  Now, this is a story by Kurt Nimmo on todaysinfowars.com.
[00:04:28.058 --> 00:04:30.080]  He says, now listen to this take on it.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:37.486]  We have a California Republican and a House Foreign Affairs Chairman, Ed Royce, and he's criticizing the Obama administration for not sending weapons.
[00:04:37.867 --> 00:04:40.649]  For not sending weapons to the regime in Kiev.
[00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:51.158]  Now, of course, the most vocal neocons are the ones right now who are in the GOP, because they're trying to score some cheap political points out of the fact that we haven't escalated this by sending more arms in.
[00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:53.440]  And Royce is saying that Russia has sent in.
[00:04:55.242 --> 00:04:56.584]  Thanks for watching!
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:18.946]  This is a picture from July 4th, 2014, which shows Buk missile launchers being transferred by Ukrainian government forces.
[00:05:19.026 --> 00:05:31.495]  So, yes, they both had it, and the fact that these are made by Russia doesn't really say anything one way or the other, because most of the weapons there that the Ukraine has, as well as the separatists, are Russian-made.
[00:05:31.875 --> 00:05:37.359]  And, of course, it was a Russian-made missile that shot down a Russian commercial airliner back in 2001.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:53.248]  Now, just so that you know that we're in full out war hysteria mode, we now see people like Ron Paul and other people who are dissenting from this line of attack, dissenting from jumping ahead full steam into a war hysteria.
[00:05:53.508 --> 00:05:56.010]  We see them demonized as dissenters.
[00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.011]  And this is a story from the National Journal.
[00:05:58.611 --> 00:06:01.553]  Ron Paul is Putin's new best friend.
[00:06:02.173 --> 00:06:07.095]  They say, it used to be that blaming America for crises abroad was largely the province of liberals.
[00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:16.238]  But now we have Ron Paul, who has been quick to attack the West and President Obama for pointing any fingers in the direction of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
[00:06:16.258 --> 00:06:26.541]  It says, just days after the tragic crash of Malaysian Airlines flight over Eastern Ukraine, Western politicians and media joined together to gain the maximum propaganda value for the disaster.
[00:06:26.581 --> 00:06:27.742]  That's what Ron Paul said.
[00:06:28.162 --> 00:06:29.562]  He said, it had to be Russia.
[00:06:29.682 --> 00:06:30.843]  It had to be Putin, they said.
[00:06:31.323 --> 00:06:43.392]  Now, she doesn't, this is the writer, is Lucia Graves, she doesn't give any of the information that Ron Paul said as to why he believes this is a false narrative, why they're pushing that, why it's propaganda.
[00:06:43.753 --> 00:06:49.918]  But we carried the story on Infowars.com, we carried Ron Paul's full article, and he has some very good reasons.
[00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:52.419]  Now this is what Ron Paul actually said.
[00:06:52.459 --> 00:07:01.765]  He said, just days after the tragic crash of Malaysian airliner flight over eastern Ukraine, Western politicians and media joined together to gain the maximum propaganda value from the disaster.
[00:07:02.086 --> 00:07:10.832]  He says, Obama's ambassador to the UN, Samantha Powers, at the UN Security Council, announced she was responsible just one day after the crash.
[00:07:10.872 --> 00:07:13.954]  But he says, these are the things they will not report.
[00:07:13.994 --> 00:07:17.436]  And he goes on to list several things that you're not hearing from the media.
[00:07:17.856 --> 00:07:20.378]  He says, without US sponsored regime change,
[00:07:20.698 --> 00:07:26.760]  It's unlikely that hundreds would have been killed in the unrest that follows, and of course the Malaysian airline crash would have never happened.
[00:07:27.101 --> 00:07:34.744]  He also says they'll not report that the Ukrainian government also uses the exact same Russian-made weapons, which is what we just pointed out in our story.
[00:07:35.084 --> 00:07:47.148]  He says they will not report that the post-coup government in Kiev has killed 250 people in the breakaway region since June, including 20 that have been killed after the plane crash.
[00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:48.449]  He says they won't report that
[00:07:48.749 --> 00:08:01.472]  Neither Russia nor separatists in Eastern Ukraine have anything to gain but everything to lose by shooting down a passenger liner full of civilians, and they won't report that the Ukrainian government has much to gain by pinning the attack on Russia.
[00:08:01.833 --> 00:08:09.435]  And finally, he says, and they will not point out the similarities to what happened a year ago in Syria with the sarin gas attack.
[00:08:09.455 --> 00:08:13.896]  And of course, we have pointed out that as well as a lack of motivation many times.
[00:08:14.696 --> 00:08:20.137]  Now, also last Thursday, even though it hasn't been as heavily covered, something else very major happened.
[00:08:20.177 --> 00:08:22.958]  And, of course, that was Israel's invasion of Gaza.
[00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:26.238]  Now, listen to Obama's statement made last Thursday.
[00:08:26.298 --> 00:08:29.919]  Listen to how rich in irony and hypocrisy it is.
[00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:39.001]  We discussed Israel's military operation in Gaza, including its efforts to stop the threat of terrorist infiltration through tunnels into Israel.
[00:08:40.241 --> 00:08:43.862]  I reaffirmed my strong support for Israel's right to defend itself.
[00:08:45.029 --> 00:08:51.672]  No nation should accept rockets being fired into its borders or terrorists tunneling into its territory.
[00:08:51.932 --> 00:08:53.613]  Now let me just repeat what he said.
[00:08:53.673 --> 00:08:58.235]  He said, of course, he reaffirmed his strong support for Israel's right to defend itself.
[00:08:58.355 --> 00:09:00.896]  In other words, by defending its borders.
[00:09:01.516 --> 00:09:10.100]  And he went on to say, no nation should accept rockets being fired into its borders or terrorists tunneling into its territory.
[00:09:11.294 --> 00:09:14.037]  Well, how does he explain what's happening on the U.S.
[00:09:14.057 --> 00:09:14.358]  border?
[00:09:15.079 --> 00:09:18.162]  Why do we have to give up our right to self-defense?
[00:09:18.222 --> 00:09:23.328]  Why do we have to allow people to tunnel or even just walk across our borders?
[00:09:23.408 --> 00:09:26.552]  And of course, it's not just unaccompanied children.
[00:09:27.533 --> 00:09:31.657]  These are very dangerous gang members, and of course, any terrorist could come across the border.
[00:09:32.277 --> 00:09:43.046]  But he said on Wall Street Journal yesterday, titled, Tunnels Matter More Than Rockets to Hamas, they said, early in the current clash between Hamas and Israel, much of the drama was in the air.
[00:09:43.086 --> 00:09:44.227]  In other words, about the rockets.
[00:09:44.368 --> 00:09:46.870]  But the real story has been underground.
[00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.853]  Hamas' tunnels into Israel are potentially much more dangerous than its random rocket barrages.
[00:09:52.233 --> 00:10:00.238]  And they say this indicates that Hamas' tunnels, and not the well-publicized episodes of kidnapping and murder, are what they're really concerned about.
[00:10:00.798 --> 00:10:08.283]  Now, the question is, of course, we have questions as to whether or not these unaccompanied children that are being brought here are being kidnapped.
[00:10:08.763 --> 00:10:23.388]  But we also know that very dangerous drug gangs, multinational drug gangs, are free to come across even using distractions of unaccompanied children to massively move across the border and to move their equipment and other things across the border.
[00:10:23.648 --> 00:10:27.789]  We also have this report from a whistleblower who talked directly to Adan Salazar.
[00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.991]  He said, cartel gunfire forces border agents to run for cover.
[00:10:32.651 --> 00:10:36.193]  Kind of like firing missiles across a border, isn't it?
[00:10:36.714 --> 00:10:50.382]  Customs and Border Protection has yet to brief its agents on the circumstances surrounding a shooting that occurred last week in South Texas, in which federal agents dodged heavy military-grade fire from the Mexican side of the border, an agent has confirmed to InfoWars.
[00:10:50.422 --> 00:10:51.283]  An exclusive story.
[00:10:51.303 --> 00:10:52.464]  He said the shooting last night
[00:10:52.964 --> 00:10:56.027]  It's going unreported in our agency and in the media.
[00:10:56.427 --> 00:10:59.069]  He said shots were not directed at border agents.
[00:10:59.109 --> 00:11:02.852]  Rather, he didn't say that, but the Border Patrol spokesperson said that.
[00:11:03.532 --> 00:11:06.675]  However, the local CBS News affiliate doesn't believe that.
[00:11:07.115 --> 00:11:15.282]  They have a report from Congressman Louie Gohmert, who was in the area, and he was saying that they were being shot at with .50 caliber bullets.
[00:11:15.802 --> 00:11:19.304]  He said bullets ricocheted into an area where Border Patrol agents were positioned.
[00:11:19.685 --> 00:11:27.129]  We don't have any armor that can stop a .50 caliber round, so our Border Patrol agents had to take cover when the rounds were ricocheting around them.
[00:11:27.189 --> 00:11:30.331]  That's what Representative Gohmert told Fox News.
[00:11:31.252 --> 00:11:32.092]  So let's be clear.
[00:11:32.652 --> 00:11:37.794]  We're not asking Obama to defend our borders by firing missiles into Mexico.
[00:11:38.074 --> 00:11:40.415]  We're not asking him to invade Mexico.
[00:11:40.855 --> 00:11:45.757]  We're just asking him to stop incentivizing an invasion into our country.
[00:11:46.437 --> 00:11:48.078]  But, of course, they're doing just the opposite.
[00:11:48.118 --> 00:11:53.440]  Here's another exclusive report from Adon Salazar and a source with the Border Patrol agencies.
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:57.022]  He says that they're being ordered to release pregnant illegals.
[00:11:57.422 --> 00:12:06.326]  South Texas Customs and Border Protection agents have been ordered to release pregnant illegal immigrants as well as those who merely claim to be pregnant.
[00:12:06.346 --> 00:12:08.386]  This is what the agent told InfoWars.
[00:12:08.707 --> 00:12:11.348]  And this, of course, is with any stage of pregnancy.
[00:12:12.068 --> 00:12:25.075]  He sent an email and said, at my muster yesterday, we received orders to begin releasing all pregnant female illegal aliens in the Rio Grande Valley sector, any stage of pregnancy, whether two weeks or eight months.
[00:12:25.596 --> 00:12:32.680]  We do not have a method of testing for an actual pregnancy either, so it appears that we'll just have to take their word for it.
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.502]  So is the Obama administration suddenly turning pro-life?
[00:12:37.002 --> 00:12:39.924]  Are they recognizing these as anchor fetuses?
[00:12:39.944 --> 00:12:48.870]  You know, we've had anchor babies, now we move back to what they would call anchor fetuses, because before the child is born they call them fetus, which is just Latin for baby anyway.
[00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:58.536]  But we've also got anchor teens coming in, and the question is, are those teens really unaccompanied minors, or are they helping to traffic, or are they part of a gang members?
[00:12:58.856 --> 00:13:01.778]  Nevertheless, it's the policies that are inviting them in.
[00:13:02.398 --> 00:13:12.288]  We have open borders, we're not controlling the borders, and unlike Israel, we're not worried about terrorists crossing the borders, but we are worried about them coming in through airports still, of course.
[00:13:12.869 --> 00:13:17.574]  Now this is from the Human Rights Watch and Columbia Law School's Human Rights Institute.
[00:13:17.694 --> 00:13:23.517]  Now this is something, of course, that we've told you many times, we've documented it, so has Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[00:13:23.877 --> 00:13:36.402]  What they're saying is, in a 214-page report looking at 27 federal terrorism cases, they say, Americans have been told that their government is keeping them safe by preventing and prosecuting terrorism inside the U.S.
[00:13:36.882 --> 00:13:38.203]  But if you take a closer look,
[00:13:38.723 --> 00:13:49.552]  You realize that many of these people would never have committed a crime if not for law enforcement encouraging, pressuring, sometimes paying them to commit terrorist acts.
[00:13:50.153 --> 00:14:03.465]  Now they focus on the aspect that this is singling out unfairly Muslims, but of course we are all suffering under the police state that has been created and of course justified by these false flag events that are constantly being
[00:14:04.025 --> 00:14:06.827]  Created and run and organized by the FBI.
[00:14:07.328 --> 00:14:13.032]  You know what is happening at the border is exactly the same thing, only on a national scale.
[00:14:13.873 --> 00:14:18.116]  Now, we also see, of course, that this is something that's been going on for quite a long time abroad.
[00:14:18.156 --> 00:14:21.799]  We see that ISIS domestic terror threat created by the CIA and the U.S.
[00:14:21.879 --> 00:14:22.379]  military.
[00:14:22.419 --> 00:14:25.121]  This is an article by Kurt Nemo that came out this weekend.
[00:14:25.962 --> 00:14:36.488]  Of course, ISIS and Al Qaeda are being run and created and enabled by the CIA, just like the FBI runs these terrorist events here in the United States and then shuts them down to justify their existence.
[00:14:37.129 --> 00:14:40.091]  The article points out the problem, as they're told by U.S.
[00:14:40.151 --> 00:14:51.558]  counterterrorism and intelligence officials, is that there are just so many jihadists with Western passports traveling to fight in Syria that they worry that some of them may slip back into the U.S.
[00:14:52.038 --> 00:14:53.239]  without being detected.
[00:14:54.039 --> 00:14:55.340]  Why are we worried about that?
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.761]  They can just walk across our wide open borders.
[00:14:58.821 --> 00:15:00.661]  Why do they need to come through the airports?
[00:15:00.722 --> 00:15:13.026]  And of course, everything that's happening in the airports, they're stepping up security, doing everything they can to tell us that we have to add even more security, even more harassment at the airports, even though they have the borders wide open.
[00:15:13.066 --> 00:15:20.389]  And of course, Kurt Nimmo points out in the article that the former head of the American Visa Bureau in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Michael Springman,
[00:15:21.329 --> 00:15:37.484]  ...told then-BBC journalist back in 2001, and that was Greg Palast, we've had him on a number of times on the Alex Jones Show, that he was repeatedly ordered by high-level State Department officials to issue visas to unqualified applicants who are allowed to enter the United States.
[00:15:38.385 --> 00:15:44.971]  And if you want to see the entire interview that Alex Jones had with Michael Springman back in 2010, we have that embedded in the article.
[00:15:45.391 --> 00:15:50.115]  He talks about the CIA terrorist visa factory is basically the way it's put out there.
[00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:58.022]  And of course, they're handing out visas to these terrorist organizations that they have trained, equipped, financed, and in many cases run their operations.
[00:15:58.503 --> 00:16:03.307]  But of course, now they have a much better source, and that is to just open up the entire border.
[00:16:03.627 --> 00:16:09.736]  Not only to Middle Eastern terrorists, but also to the multinational drug gangs of Central and South America.
[00:16:10.156 --> 00:16:10.757]  Now, stay with us.
[00:16:10.857 --> 00:16:19.028]  Right after the break, we've got some breaking news about Verizon, who's going to be offering you free gifts and incentives to allow them to spy on you.
[00:16:19.048 --> 00:16:19.489]  Stay with us.
[00:16:19.529 --> 00:16:20.110]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:22.335 --> 00:16:26.158]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[00:16:26.559 --> 00:16:27.760]  I taste dirt in it.
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:28.941]  God knows what's in this.
[00:16:29.081 --> 00:16:30.082]  This has an aftertaste.
[00:16:30.102 --> 00:16:31.683]  Tastes like Austin water?
[00:16:31.923 --> 00:16:32.804]  Yeah, it does.
[00:16:32.864 --> 00:16:37.028]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[00:16:37.268 --> 00:16:43.393]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered through the ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[00:16:43.533 --> 00:16:44.334]  High quality H2O.
[00:16:44.354 --> 00:16:45.895]  That one is better.
[00:16:45.975 --> 00:16:46.956]  Tastes like nothing.
[00:16:47.236 --> 00:16:48.637]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[00:16:48.698 --> 00:16:49.198]  It's good water.
[00:16:49.298 --> 00:16:57.829]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, Monsanto's deadly pesticide, glyphosate, and many others.
[00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:05.759]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lower IQ, and even cancer.
[00:17:06.019 --> 00:17:08.543]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[00:17:09.103 --> 00:17:11.465]  Yeah, there's that processed flavor to it.
[00:17:11.785 --> 00:17:21.351]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances and many more, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[00:17:21.531 --> 00:17:23.132]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[00:17:23.192 --> 00:17:23.893]  It's good water.
[00:17:24.568 --> 00:17:24.988]  Refreshing.
[00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:25.809]  It's good.
[00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:28.691]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today.

[00:17:42.059 --> 00:17:44.980]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.080]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:53.222]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[00:17:53.442 --> 00:17:58.463]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[00:17:58.543 --> 00:18:03.225]  The new InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver is the answer for you and your family.
[00:18:03.425 --> 00:18:07.926]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[00:18:08.226 --> 00:18:16.612]  The Infowars LifeSilver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a two-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[00:18:16.832 --> 00:18:18.793]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:30.401]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water for your
[00:18:30.401 --> 00:18:31.443]  We're good to go.
[00:18:43.049 --> 00:18:43.590]  Welcome back.
[00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:57.406]  Now, if you remember just a few months ago, there was a Snowden document leak that showed some NSA slides where the NSA was essentially bragging about how they had established Big Brother through the iPhone, and of course, you're buying it.
[00:18:57.926 --> 00:19:01.150]  Now, in this slide, they had the iconic 1984 commercial from Apple.
[00:19:03.152 --> 00:19:14.736]  And they said, who would have thought that in 1984, then they go that this, and they show Steve Jobs holding up an iPhone, and then the third slide says, would be Big Brother, and they show people lining up in the droves to get it.
[00:19:15.276 --> 00:19:17.296]  Well, now they're going even farther.
[00:19:17.336 --> 00:19:21.938]  We see a story from Wall Street Journal today about your new digital butler.
[00:19:22.418 --> 00:19:25.241]  Yes, this is what they call a social OS.
[00:19:25.861 --> 00:19:33.649]  They write, what if all of us had our own search engine for everyone with whom we have ever come in contact, no matter how trivial our interaction?
[00:19:34.089 --> 00:19:35.090]  Just like the NSA, right?
[00:19:35.431 --> 00:19:43.959]  And what if it already knew who they were, served as master context database for pretty much the entire world, and what if this service lived on
[00:19:44.159 --> 00:19:44.419]  All right.
[00:20:04.187 --> 00:20:07.769]  Just take that tea off of there, and that's exactly what these guys are doing to you.
[00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:09.130]  Now listen to what else they say.
[00:20:34.087 --> 00:20:34.547]  Some people.
[00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:36.129]  Yeah, it's real creepy.
[00:20:36.189 --> 00:20:37.209]  And here's another example.
[00:20:37.229 --> 00:20:42.774]  They say when you arrive in a new city, it will tell you people that you might want to get to know.
[00:20:42.794 --> 00:20:44.495]  Of course, those would be people like you.
[00:20:44.855 --> 00:20:50.720]  Maybe people that have the same beliefs in politics or maybe other more private areas.
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:57.143]  This is something they say we've already seen from Google, of course, in their smart wristwatches, as well as Google Now.
[00:20:57.503 --> 00:21:06.988]  But then they go on and say, rather than going through the Internet and looking at all these things, just imagine this as your digital butler serving up all this information for you.
[00:21:07.028 --> 00:21:09.449]  See, it's not really something you should be afraid of.
[00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:16.093]  It's just a friendly little digital butler that is turning over all of this information to the surveillance state.
[00:21:16.433 --> 00:21:17.734]  But you don't have to wait for the app.
[00:21:18.294 --> 00:21:20.175]  You can now do that with Verizon.
[00:21:20.195 --> 00:21:28.859]  Of course, Kit Daniels has an article up on Infowars.com today, says Verizon offers free gifts to customers who consent to surveillance.
[00:21:29.279 --> 00:21:37.383]  Verizon Wireless is launching a rewards program this week for subscribers who will consent to having their everyday movements tracked.
[00:21:37.443 --> 00:21:40.024]  The program is called Smart Rewards.
[00:21:40.044 --> 00:21:43.926]  That's right, whenever they get you to do something really dumb, they always call it smart.
[00:21:44.526 --> 00:21:58.590]  It offers gift cards, travel deals to subscribers who surrender their web surfing, their app usage, and their location data in exchange for targeted advertisements based on that personal information through the Verizon Selects tracking program.
[00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:03.291]  Now, interestingly enough, when they asked them about this, they said, well, we think it's going to help us with
[00:22:03.911 --> 00:22:05.091]  Customer retention.
[00:22:05.492 --> 00:22:06.932]  We'll stay with us right after the break.
[00:22:06.972 --> 00:22:15.635]  Of course, we're going to have those callers who were pilots and air traffic control personnel who wanted to know why the plane was where it was.
[00:22:15.655 --> 00:22:21.937]  And of course, that brings up questions of contributory negligence at the very least, if not questions of false flags.
[00:22:21.957 --> 00:22:22.518]  So stay with us.
[00:22:22.558 --> 00:22:23.258]  We'll be right back.
[00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:31.957]  Alex Jones here to break down some exciting developments in the area of research concerning supplemental iodine.
[00:22:32.597 --> 00:22:34.759]  It's nothing less than phenomenal.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:41.546]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:22:41.866 --> 00:22:45.827]  And I used some of the mainline iodine supplements and they upset my stomach and I had some issues with it.
[00:22:46.327 --> 00:22:56.609]  Until I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group, who I was already interviewing as an expert on my radio show, and I began taking the product before he actually rolled it out.
[00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:02.371]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:23:03.131 --> 00:23:10.913]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.121]  We're good to go.
[00:23:31.349 --> 00:23:36.213]  Pure iodine and the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:23:36.853 --> 00:23:49.182]  I was over 270 pounds and with the iodine exercise and better diet, I have lost now more than 50 pounds total and I'm continuing to lose the weight.
[00:23:49.522 --> 00:23:53.565]  I have more energy, my libido, all this crap came out of my skin.
[00:23:54.185 --> 00:23:55.647]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:23:55.687 --> 00:23:57.048]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:23:57.328 --> 00:23:58.449]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:03.754]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:04.094 --> 00:24:04.975]  This is innovating.
[00:24:05.375 --> 00:24:06.396]  This is trailblazing.
[00:24:06.817 --> 00:24:14.123]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:24:14.343 --> 00:24:18.447]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:24:18.627 --> 00:24:20.449]  Take advantage of this unprecedented
[00:24:20.869 --> 00:24:30.560]  Roy, what do you think about this as an air traffic controller?
[00:24:31.081 --> 00:24:32.883]  And did I get it right or part of it right?
[00:24:33.323 --> 00:24:33.924]  What do you think?
[00:24:33.964 --> 00:24:41.813]  I mean, isn't the story that all the other air traffic wasn't going through this corridor and that this flight went through a war zone?
[00:24:43.942 --> 00:24:45.503]  Hey Alex, yeah, you're absolutely right.
[00:24:45.823 --> 00:24:47.523]  There's something that's not adding up there.
[00:24:47.663 --> 00:24:58.147]  If, you know, the pilots do check their flight plans ten times over, the FAA said that they prohibit our airlines from flying over these war zones right now, so there's no way that you see a carrier flying through there, especially a 777.
[00:24:59.047 --> 00:25:06.350]  I'm not sure overseas how they're working that, but I imagine it'd be similar since all of our rules are roughly the same or getting close to being the same.
[00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:09.291]  So yeah, you're right, it's not adding up at all.
[00:25:09.861 --> 00:25:21.784]  Well I had some family that worked for FAA Europe and I gave them a call and they worked there in the 80s in translating and they said that there's just no way they would direct an airliner over a war zone.
[00:25:23.505 --> 00:25:33.648]  Absolutely not and it's not uncommon for example on Tuesday the 11th of September 2001 where they'll evacuate they'll tell everybody in the control tower to leave their position.
[00:25:34.475 --> 00:25:39.617]  And send them into the space down below where there is no windows, then they'll staff that control tower with black ops.
[00:25:39.697 --> 00:25:41.598]  It happens all the time in Fallon, Nevada.
[00:25:42.398 --> 00:25:45.299]  The control tower at Area 51, Diego Garcia, this happens.
[00:25:45.619 --> 00:25:49.981]  You know, it's not uncommon to see that happen, so that the controllers have no idea what's going on.
[00:25:50.061 --> 00:25:53.882]  Again, repeating the compartmentalization of the federal government.
[00:25:54.778 --> 00:26:05.444]  What does your gut as an air traffic controller tell you is going on over here with this Russia situation and this shoot down of this aircraft?
[00:26:07.265 --> 00:26:13.148]  Eleven years as a controller, my gut tells me that obviously there's a cover-up going on.
[00:26:13.468 --> 00:26:21.833]  And again, if you ask controllers in Europe, chances are they were either removed or if they do talk about it, they're going to be disappeared.
[00:26:22.369 --> 00:26:23.410]  Brendan, thanks for calling in.
[00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:24.210]  Thanks for holding.
[00:26:24.851 --> 00:26:25.552]  You're on the air.
[00:26:25.572 --> 00:26:26.552]  You say you're in the Air Force.
[00:26:26.592 --> 00:26:29.194]  What's your take on all this?
[00:26:29.214 --> 00:26:30.075]  Yes, thank you, Alex.
[00:26:30.435 --> 00:26:33.278]  Yes, I was in the Air Force in the early 90s.
[00:26:35.619 --> 00:26:42.425]  It's very possible that, well, first of all, we have an aircraft that's on a projected flight path.
[00:26:43.285 --> 00:26:51.572]  It's pretty much going to stay on that path unless there's some extraneous circumstances that are going to force it.
[00:26:52.552 --> 00:26:53.373]  We're good to go.
[00:27:07.498 --> 00:27:11.860]  through an ash cloud at nighttime from a volcano and shut the engines down.
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:22.304]  You know, nowadays we have real-time information to let those pilots and crew plan for anything in the way of the flight.
[00:27:22.324 --> 00:27:24.765]  It's all plotted out for months.
[00:27:24.845 --> 00:27:26.846]  Don't fly over this area, correct?
[00:27:26.906 --> 00:27:31.668]  So the big question should be who directed the flight over it, correct?
[00:27:32.486 --> 00:27:54.631]  Correct, and there's reports that there were Ukrainian fighters that actually went up to altitude and possibly have nudged that Malaysian airliner, you know, so many miles each way, above or below, or within, I should say, the Lugansk, Donetsk region of Ukraine.
[00:27:54.691 --> 00:27:59.932]  And then that way, that way, I've seen those reports, that way there wouldn't be a record of the flight plan being changed.
[00:28:00.153 --> 00:28:01.793]  They would just order them radio to radio.
[00:28:02.811 --> 00:28:03.371]  Absolutely.
[00:28:03.451 --> 00:28:03.872]  Absolutely.
[00:28:03.912 --> 00:28:11.996]  So if their projected flight path was, okay, well, we know that's a war zone, so let's fly above that war region or below the region.
[00:28:12.956 --> 00:28:15.238]  And that will be our projected flight path.
[00:28:15.298 --> 00:28:25.203]  And then when you're in that area, those fighters come in and force you back into that war over that war zone and then break off.
[00:28:25.383 --> 00:28:29.225]  And then, you know, it's, it's shot down by a missile or,
[00:28:30.405 --> 00:28:31.426]  Or what have you.
[00:28:32.026 --> 00:28:49.836]  But what I'd like to call attention to is a short video that showed a, it was either a pro-Russian rebel or Ukrainian forces, some guy that was off the back of a truck with an armful of fresh passports.
[00:28:51.137 --> 00:28:52.217]  Crisp passports.
[00:28:52.237 --> 00:28:52.858]  No, I saw that.
[00:28:52.898 --> 00:28:53.318]  I saw that.
[00:28:53.378 --> 00:28:53.678]  I know.
[00:28:54.058 --> 00:28:54.999]  None of this adds up.
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:00.121]  I quite frankly, again, don't know what happened, but I know it's war propaganda.
[00:29:00.362 --> 00:29:01.982]  I know we don't need a new Cold War over this.
[00:29:02.262 --> 00:29:03.363]  I know it's a war zone.
[00:29:03.723 --> 00:29:15.107]  And I know that if it turns out to be the Russians, I believe, according to studying international law and seeing other shoot-downs, that the blame goes on whoever directed that flight over a war zone.
[00:29:15.947 --> 00:29:21.249]  I mean, you're in the Air Force, and you seem to know a lot about this, but is that correct, what I just said?
[00:29:21.269 --> 00:29:23.110]  Absolutely.
[00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:25.491]  I just believe that I'm not...
[00:29:26.184 --> 00:29:32.669]  Pro-Russia either, but I just believe that why would they spend the time and the resources to prove that they didn't have anything to do with it?
[00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:46.839]  Uh, you know, and to prove to the rest of the world, hey, you know, we, we, what, what reason will we have to bring this airliner down so we could draw the attention of the West and the rest of the world on us?
[00:29:48.164 --> 00:29:48.504]  I don't know.
[00:30:09.719 --> 00:30:11.139]  It just doesn't make any sense.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.880]  I agree.
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.140]  This is Lusitania 2.0.
[00:30:15.101 --> 00:30:15.661]  Great points.
[00:30:15.961 --> 00:30:17.001]  Thank you for calling in, Brendan.
[00:30:17.682 --> 00:30:21.103]  Let's talk to Tom in Baltimore, then Ron, John, and others.
[00:30:21.123 --> 00:30:21.743]  Go ahead, Tom.
[00:30:22.963 --> 00:30:24.144]  Good afternoon, Mr. Jones.
[00:30:24.304 --> 00:30:31.086]  I just want to elaborate a little bit on what one of your previous callers had stated about the Jets possibly
[00:30:32.282 --> 00:30:32.863]  I think so.
[00:30:55.403 --> 00:30:57.284]  Usually, we've been doing sensitive operations.
[00:30:57.304 --> 00:31:00.764]  We didn't want them shadowing us everywhere we went.
[00:31:00.804 --> 00:31:02.044]  They were getting away our position.
[00:31:02.444 --> 00:31:08.866]  So, we would call one of our helicopters to come, and they didn't have to contact them by radio.
[00:31:09.366 --> 00:31:15.707]  They would spot them up at night sometimes, or they would just fly by and nudge them.
[00:31:16.007 --> 00:31:21.048]  My thinking is, if you've got several fighter jets flying
[00:31:21.748 --> 00:31:23.369]  Aggressively by your plane.
[00:31:23.609 --> 00:31:28.570]  You're not going to have to have any radio contact whatsoever, which might be what they had in mind.
[00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:39.593]  You're going to steer clear of where those fighter jets are operating the same way the news helicopters would clear out when a chopper would buzz them or spot them up.
[00:31:41.034 --> 00:31:42.154]  It makes perfect sense.
[00:31:42.214 --> 00:31:46.495]  And you would have no record of any communication telling them to do anything.
[00:31:46.816 --> 00:31:48.156]  They would just do it.
[00:31:49.147 --> 00:31:49.448]  Wow.
[00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:52.857]  What does your gut overall tell you is going on here?
[00:31:54.782 --> 00:31:55.063]  You know...
[00:31:56.388 --> 00:32:04.934]  I'll tell you what, you can't believe anything that you hear from the politicians or the news, or what we used to call it in court, through the poisonous tree.
[00:32:05.054 --> 00:32:12.379]  You know, once they tell you and feed you so many lies, you can't take anything that they say as factual or truthful at all.
[00:32:12.499 --> 00:32:13.960]  You know, they've done it to themselves.
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:16.121]  So, it's really a guessing game.
[00:32:17.062 --> 00:32:21.025]  It certainly, though, appears that, like you said,
[00:32:21.945 --> 00:32:33.212]  You know, we've traditionally not been big fans this country of Russia, but they certainly seem to be operating in the way that we had always strived to operate.
[00:32:33.712 --> 00:32:42.317]  They're doing things that the United States used to do when I was a younger man, and I can't fault them for that.
[00:32:42.797 --> 00:32:46.039]  So, you know, right now the credibility has to go with them.
[00:32:46.059 --> 00:32:47.920]  I mean, that's just called the way I see it.
[00:32:48.433 --> 00:32:48.915]  I agree with you.
[00:32:48.955 --> 00:32:51.084]  Plus, they don't stand a game from shooting this airliner down.
[00:32:52.637 --> 00:32:53.958]  Well, that's it for our news tonight.

[00:33:18.914 --> 00:33:19.415]  Stay with us.
[00:33:25.851 --> 00:33:30.152]  You've experienced and heard about the benefits of Super Male Vitality.
[00:33:30.672 --> 00:33:33.152]  Now, the new formula has arrived.
[00:33:33.533 --> 00:33:37.413]  Introducing the new Super Female Vitality.
[00:33:37.693 --> 00:33:45.275]  I have specifically designed this formula to help the body naturally regulate itself without the use of artificial hormones.
[00:33:45.695 --> 00:33:49.016]  Key ingredients chosen from the highest quality sources.

[00:34:00.986 --> 00:34:03.449]  Central at InfoWarsNews.com.

[00:34:17.495 --> 00:34:25.798]  It's been more than 16 years since Matt Drudge gave his historic speech at the National Press Club on June 2nd, 1998.
[00:34:27.099 --> 00:34:36.723]  At that time, he said that the mainstream media would go bankrupt, that individual bloggers and researchers on the internet were just as important as the New York Times.
[00:34:37.583 --> 00:34:49.371]  The controlled state-run media had a field day making fun of Matt Drudge, but today their hubris has drained away and they're no longer as arrogant as they once were.
[00:34:49.811 --> 00:35:05.342]  Now we see calls for the FCC to regulate print news and online news, and we see establishment publications like Time Magazine, Newsweek, and the New York Times battling to keep from going completely bankrupt and imploding.
[00:35:06.002 --> 00:35:12.767]  It turns out, pretty much everything that Matt Drudge said in that 40-minute speech has now come true.
[00:35:13.227 --> 00:35:18.310]  Well, Matt Drudge is saying a lot of things today that the mainstream media is still laughing at.
[00:35:18.871 --> 00:35:22.713]  Why do they laugh at people that have been proven right over and over again?
[00:35:23.154 --> 00:35:27.657]  Here are some of the most important moments, in my view, from Drudge's speech.
[00:35:27.937 --> 00:35:34.161]  And we're also adding headlines from over the years to show just how much of what he had to say came true.
[00:35:37.565 --> 00:35:45.902]  This marks the first time that an individual has access to the news wires outside of a newsroom.
[00:35:47.984 --> 00:35:57.808]  You get to read all the news from the Associated Press, UPI, Reuters, to the Morrocan Agency French Press and the Genois.
[00:35:58.369 --> 00:36:00.449]  I'm a personal fan of the Genois Press.
[00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:07.713]  And time was, only newsrooms had access to the full pictures of the day's events.
[00:36:08.913 --> 00:36:10.154]  But now any citizen does.
[00:36:12.235 --> 00:36:17.117]  We get to see the kinds of cuts that are made for all kinds of reasons.
[00:36:18.425 --> 00:36:27.513]  Endless layers of editors with endless agendas changing bits and pieces so by the time the newspaper hits your welcome mat, it had no meaning.
[00:36:29.155 --> 00:36:33.058]  Now with a modem, anyone can follow the world and report on the world.
[00:36:34.119 --> 00:36:36.261]  No middleman, no big brother.
[00:36:38.556 --> 00:36:39.936]  And I guess this changes everything.
[00:36:40.317 --> 00:36:48.979]  More than 10 years after breaking the Clinton-Lewinsky story, Matt Drudge remains more powerful than ever with his website, thedrudgereport.com.
[00:36:48.999 --> 00:36:51.080]  Matt Drudge is a legend on the internet.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:55.161]  Every journalist and politician in America reads his website on a daily basis.
[00:36:55.701 --> 00:37:00.563]  When radio lost out to television, there was anxiety.
[00:37:01.914 --> 00:37:11.020]  The people in the radio business were absolutely anxious and demanded government stop the upcoming television wave.
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:17.123]  Television was very nervous about other mediums coming forward.
[00:37:17.163 --> 00:37:17.543]  Cable.
[00:37:19.345 --> 00:37:24.948]  The movies didn't want sitcoms to be taped at movie studios for fear it would take away from the movies.
[00:37:26.369 --> 00:37:26.669]  No.
[00:37:27.189 --> 00:37:28.570]  Television saved the movies.
[00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:31.372]  The internet is going to save the news business.
[00:37:35.371 --> 00:37:38.466]  I envision a future where there will be 300 million reporters.
[00:37:40.964 --> 00:37:43.706]  Where anyone from anywhere can report for any reason.
[00:37:44.486 --> 00:37:47.409]  It's freedom of participation absolutely realized.
[00:37:47.669 --> 00:37:51.351]  First of all, you disrespected me, this badge, and my department.
[00:37:51.992 --> 00:37:52.652]  You understand me?
[00:37:52.892 --> 00:37:56.315]  When I'm talking to you, you shut your mouth and you listen.
[00:37:56.475 --> 00:37:57.916]  Did I not give you a warning?
[00:37:58.076 --> 00:37:58.797]  You gave me a warning.
[00:37:58.937 --> 00:37:59.117]  Okay.
[00:37:59.137 --> 00:38:00.458]  I have a right in the United States.
[00:38:00.698 --> 00:38:01.558]  I know my rights.
[00:38:01.759 --> 00:38:02.559]  I don't give it!
[00:38:02.579 --> 00:38:04.000]  I don't care.
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:05.221]  Give me the board.
[00:38:05.361 --> 00:38:08.383]  Obviously your parents don't put a foot in your butt quite enough.
[00:38:08.864 --> 00:38:10.625]  Because you don't understand the meaning of respect.
[00:38:13.533 --> 00:38:14.073]  You see this?
[00:38:14.634 --> 00:38:15.675]  Yes, you see this!
[00:38:15.815 --> 00:38:16.756]  I took the void!
[00:38:16.996 --> 00:38:18.357]  You have a problem with it?
[00:38:18.517 --> 00:38:19.438]  I have a problem!
[00:38:19.458 --> 00:38:20.419]  Then bring your parents down!
[00:38:20.459 --> 00:38:21.379]  We'll discuss this!
[00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:22.200]  Go for it!
[00:38:22.701 --> 00:38:23.321]  Go for it!
[00:38:23.601 --> 00:38:26.143]  Have you been there for the ceremony with the cremation of Kerr?
[00:38:27.625 --> 00:38:30.647]  Frankly, I don't think that's something I need to talk to you about.
[00:38:31.308 --> 00:38:31.548]  Really?
[00:38:31.568 --> 00:38:32.088]  That's right.
[00:38:32.549 --> 00:38:34.330]  Well, I'm Alex Jones and I snuck in there in 2000.
[00:38:35.151 --> 00:38:37.393]  I'm the guy that blew it wide open and got the video.
[00:38:37.413 --> 00:38:38.514]  It's been on national TV.
[00:38:38.694 --> 00:38:40.015]  Well, I disrespect you for that.
[00:38:40.455 --> 00:38:40.775]  You do?
[00:38:40.936 --> 00:38:41.116]  I do.
[00:38:41.476 --> 00:38:43.559]  But it's a lot of big public officials going in there.
[00:38:43.799 --> 00:38:44.640]  Don't we deserve to know?
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:52.150]  You took an under... I don't know anything about you, and I don't know anything about your film, but if you go in there with an understanding, you violated that understanding by releasing that film, and I don't respect you for that.
[00:38:52.793 --> 00:38:54.494]  Really?
[00:38:54.574 --> 00:38:58.117]  I'm sorry, you took an understanding when you went in there that you would not do that film.
[00:38:58.417 --> 00:38:59.618]  Did you have an understanding when you went in there?
[00:39:00.038 --> 00:39:00.239]  No.
[00:39:00.459 --> 00:39:01.119]  Did you crash it?
[00:39:01.479 --> 00:39:01.680]  Yes.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:04.041]  Yeah, and it has no trespassing signs there too, doesn't it?
[00:39:04.061 --> 00:39:05.022]  No, they put them up after.
[00:39:05.462 --> 00:39:06.043]  I just walked in.
[00:39:06.163 --> 00:39:07.524]  I'm sorry, sir, I've been there before.
[00:39:07.584 --> 00:39:11.947]  I know what the circumstances are, and I'm sorry you violated the understandings.
[00:39:11.967 --> 00:39:13.348]  That was not a gentlemanly thing to do.
[00:39:13.368 --> 00:39:14.169]  But what about the ritual?
[00:39:14.209 --> 00:39:15.330]  Is the ritual gentlemanly?
[00:39:23.183 --> 00:39:26.726]  Sir, I don't owe you this comment.
[00:39:26.826 --> 00:39:28.987]  I know, I appreciate it.
[00:39:29.047 --> 00:39:33.390]  This is what's called ambush journalism, and I disrespect you for that as well, so thank you and goodbye.
[00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:34.531]  Have you ever been in a ritual?
[00:39:34.551 --> 00:39:35.812]  That's none of your damn business.
[00:39:36.585 --> 00:39:38.127]  Oh, great.
[00:39:38.687 --> 00:39:39.748]  Listen, listen.
[00:39:40.429 --> 00:39:44.092]  You go around and make understandings with people and violate them.
[00:39:44.973 --> 00:39:49.217]  You ambush people on the streets, and that's an inappropriate form of journalism.
[00:39:49.417 --> 00:39:52.720]  If you wish to practice that, that's fine, but don't ask others to respect you for it.
[00:39:53.632 --> 00:39:55.993]  You can do your Free American like anything you want.
[00:39:56.273 --> 00:39:59.394]  If you want to be uncivil and rude and ungentlemanly, that's up to you.
[00:39:59.655 --> 00:40:02.676]  But don't expect the rest of us to say, oh well, you're... You guys are setting policy in there, Mr. Gergen.
[00:40:02.776 --> 00:40:04.497]  I'm sorry, nobody sets policy in there.
[00:40:04.757 --> 00:40:06.257]  We try to be gentlemen.
[00:40:06.558 --> 00:40:08.238]  And obviously, you don't belong there.
[00:40:08.258 --> 00:40:09.519]  Weaving spiders come not here?
[00:40:09.539 --> 00:40:11.080]  Yeah!
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.841]  That is a three-pointer!
[00:40:15.281 --> 00:40:15.461]  Woo!
[00:40:15.481 --> 00:40:16.642]  What's up, man?
[00:40:17.122 --> 00:40:18.603]  How are you doing today, sir?
[00:40:18.823 --> 00:40:18.963]  Good.
[00:40:19.003 --> 00:40:19.583]  Are you a citizen?
[00:40:20.303 --> 00:40:21.164]  That's my business.
[00:40:21.897 --> 00:40:22.937]  Well, it's our business to ask.
[00:40:22.977 --> 00:40:23.438]  Are you a U.S.
[00:40:23.458 --> 00:40:24.038]  citizen or not?
[00:40:24.298 --> 00:40:25.238]  You can ask, that's fine.
[00:40:25.759 --> 00:40:26.879]  And you have to answer me, right?
[00:40:26.959 --> 00:40:29.120]  I have to detain you until you can either tell me that you're a U.S.
[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:32.281]  citizen... Well, I don't have to answer you because I have rights as an American.
[00:40:32.321 --> 00:40:35.903]  Sir, go ahead and pull over there, behind that other vehicle, if you'd do me a favor.
[00:40:36.683 --> 00:40:38.484]  No thanks.
[00:40:39.024 --> 00:40:40.384]  I'd like to just go on my way.
[00:40:41.405 --> 00:40:43.366]  You can go on your way as soon as you tell me if you're a U.S.
[00:40:43.386 --> 00:40:43.766]  citizen.
[00:40:44.383 --> 00:40:48.485]  Well, you know, I didn't know that I have to go around proving that I'm a citizen.
[00:40:48.505 --> 00:40:51.906]  Do I need to like show my papers like the Nazis?
[00:40:52.566 --> 00:40:54.127]  Am I immigrating somewhere?
[00:40:54.147 --> 00:40:54.687]  Is this Mexico?
[00:40:54.727 --> 00:40:55.488]  Well, let me ask you this.
[00:40:55.528 --> 00:40:57.248]  Is this Nazi Germany now?
[00:40:57.268 --> 00:40:58.569]  Do I have to show my papers?
[00:40:58.609 --> 00:40:59.149]  Grab the vehicle.
[00:41:16.229 --> 00:41:17.330]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:18.471]  Go back inside right now!
[00:41:18.611 --> 00:41:19.332]  I am inside.
[00:41:19.752 --> 00:41:20.493]  This is my door.
[00:41:20.533 --> 00:41:22.014]  I'm standing right inside my apartment.
[00:41:23.456 --> 00:41:26.779]  Sir, I'm inside my apartment.
[00:41:26.799 --> 00:41:38.610]  The First Lady of the United States recently addressed concerns about Internet during a cyberspatial Millennium Project press conference just weeks after Lewinsky broke.
[00:41:42.276 --> 00:41:46.298]  She said, we're all going to have to rethink how we deal with the Internet.
[00:41:48.059 --> 00:41:56.042]  As exciting as these new developments are, there are a number of serious issues without any kind of editing function or gatekeeping function.
[00:41:57.183 --> 00:41:58.864]  I wonder who she was referring to.
[00:42:01.085 --> 00:42:03.506]  Mrs. Clinton continued, any time an individual
[00:42:04.605 --> 00:42:17.274]  Leaps so far ahead of that balance and throws a system, whatever it might be, political, economic, technological, out of balance, you got a problem.
[00:42:18.335 --> 00:42:23.119]  It can lead to all kinds of bad outcomes, which we have seen historically.
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:28.323]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:42:29.127 --> 00:42:31.589]  Would she have said the same thing about Ben Franklin?
[00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:33.650]  Or Thomas Edison?
[00:42:34.291 --> 00:42:35.151]  Or Henry Ford?
[00:42:35.172 --> 00:42:35.992]  Or Einstein?
[00:42:36.853 --> 00:42:40.515]  They all leapt so far ahead out that they shook the balance?
[00:42:43.017 --> 00:42:43.318]  No!
[00:42:43.538 --> 00:42:46.160]  I say to these people, faster, not slower!
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:47.441]  Create!
[00:42:47.781 --> 00:42:49.162]  Let your mind flow!
[00:42:49.242 --> 00:42:50.843]  Let the imagination take over!
[00:42:51.183 --> 00:42:55.647]  And if technology has finally caught up with individual liberty,
[00:42:56.863 --> 00:43:01.287]  Why would anyone who loves freedom want to rethink that?
[00:43:01.847 --> 00:43:09.793]  If you're an undersecretary at the Energy Department and you're doing an interview and you say one thing, you know, during it, you could end up being on the front page of Drudge.
[00:43:10.354 --> 00:43:20.222]  Anyone saying anything can get caught up in the spin cycle in a way that is very damaging.
[00:43:20.242 --> 00:43:24.305]  You know, it hurts what we're trying to do on DailyBase, but also is very damaging to that individual person.
[00:43:24.545 --> 00:43:26.327]  And we cannot hide our bad news stories.
[00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:33.062]  Bad news gets out one way or the other, and we must come to terms with telling the bad stories as well as the good.
[00:43:34.102 --> 00:43:39.684]  When bad things happen, the American people should hear it from us, not as a scoop on the Drudge Report.
[00:43:39.924 --> 00:43:56.990]  The editor of Civilization Magazine, Adam Goodhart, wrote a great op-ed in the New York Times talking about, is this really something new, this type of fast reporting, this competitive, I'm very competitive, I'm part of the headline generation.
[00:43:59.557 --> 00:44:03.320]  He maintains it was a going back to our foundations.
[00:44:04.101 --> 00:44:07.604]  When the press was found in quite a different atmosphere.
[00:44:07.944 --> 00:44:12.608]  When the press would report that the president's mother was a common prostitute brought over by the British Army.
[00:44:12.628 --> 00:44:16.992]  Imagine if someone did that now.
[00:44:19.334 --> 00:44:24.318]  We have a great tradition of freedom of the press in this country.
[00:44:24.599 --> 00:44:25.599]  Unpopular press.
[00:44:26.693 --> 00:44:35.246]  If the First Lady is concerned about this internet cycle, what would she have done during the heyday when there was 12, 13 editions of a paper in one day?
[00:44:36.068 --> 00:44:37.810]  What would she have done with that news cycle?
[00:44:38.591 --> 00:44:39.633]  That's the foundation.
[00:44:39.673 --> 00:44:41.055]  That's what makes this club great.
[00:44:41.795 --> 00:44:42.556]  Is the tradition.
[00:44:43.196 --> 00:44:47.480]  And I think we have a tradition of provocative press.
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:51.523]  And that I maintain that I'm the new face on that.
[00:44:52.003 --> 00:44:53.164]  I'll take that for a season.
[00:44:53.665 --> 00:44:55.666]  But a lot of the stuff I do is serious stuff.
[00:44:55.767 --> 00:45:00.891]  I was first to report that the encryption was missing from a Laurel satellite, for example, a couple weeks ago.
[00:45:01.832 --> 00:45:03.793]  I didn't see the main press reporting that one.
[00:45:05.334 --> 00:45:07.596]  So not everything I do is gossip or bedroom.
[00:45:07.856 --> 00:45:09.638]  To the contrary, I think that's just an easy
[00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:13.924]  Uh, label to dismiss me, and to dismiss the new medium.
[00:45:14.444 --> 00:45:22.953]  But, uh, I'm excited about the launch of this internet medium, and I get the freedom of the press belongs to anyone who owns one.
[00:45:25.714 --> 00:45:31.757]  Tonight, the Drudge Report and InfoWars are once again in the crosshairs, as the U.S.
[00:45:31.817 --> 00:45:36.500]  government seeks to regulate conservative media via election laws.
[00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:48.546]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist, whose stories often make their way from his website, InfoWars, where on any day you can find headlines about vaccines, mass fluoridation, and the 9-11 cover-up.
[00:45:49.827 --> 00:45:52.628]  Into the so-called mainstream GOP establishment.
[00:45:53.209 --> 00:45:56.650]  Alex Jones was a champion of Clive and Bundy from the very beginning.
[00:45:56.890 --> 00:46:03.933]  Because he's saying he'll do whatever he has to to not be, you know, have his grazing rights stolen by these pirates.
[00:46:04.213 --> 00:46:08.415]  Drudge elevated the story and it made its way onto Fox News' airwaves.
[00:46:09.015 --> 00:46:14.238]  Next thing you know, so-called mainstream Republicans are calling people like this patriots.
[00:46:14.818 --> 00:46:22.649]  The conservative website that's called The Drudge Report pulled out all the stops today to promote a big, new, bombshell video!
[00:46:22.709 --> 00:46:26.054]  Today, the leading conservative website's headline was this.
[00:46:26.615 --> 00:46:29.960]  Civil War sent it to go for handguns.
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:30.780]  I'm an addict.
[00:46:31.061 --> 00:46:31.861]  I'm a drudge addict.
[00:46:32.181 --> 00:46:41.086]  My homepage is actually something else, National Review, but I find myself going to drudge all the time because as a communications professional, you can tell what's going to come down the pike.
[00:46:41.166 --> 00:46:46.129]  If there's a siren on Drudge Report, you're like, oh boy, better go knock on the Oval Office door and let them know what's going to happen.
[00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:47.350]  Walkergate.
[00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:48.491]  Yes, we're calling it that.
[00:46:48.691 --> 00:46:59.097]  It's the latest Hillary conspiracy theory that set the internet to blaze after the Drudge Report questioned whether Clinton was using a walker in this People Magazine cover photo.
[00:46:59.397 --> 00:47:08.861]  Well internet pioneer Matt Drudge created a firestorm over the weekend tweeting, just paid the Obamacare penalty for not getting covered, I'm calling it a liberty tax.
[00:47:08.961 --> 00:47:15.483]  But a White House representative firing back tweeting, flat lie, no fee for previous years, scary how much influence he once had.
[00:47:15.643 --> 00:47:19.624]  And then the White House shot back and said, you know, made some cheap shot about, oh, he used to be relevant.
[00:47:19.664 --> 00:47:20.465]  Are you kidding me?
[00:47:20.745 --> 00:47:22.305]  Matt Drudge used to be relevant?
[00:47:22.565 --> 00:47:23.466]  Let me give you the numbers.
[00:47:23.806 --> 00:47:31.289]  In one month, go on the website, almost 810 million unique views on the Drudge Report.
[00:47:31.669 --> 00:47:34.930]  I guess that's a nice Twitter fight between the White House and Matt Drudge.
[00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:37.291]  People had suggested I start a mailing list.
[00:47:38.271 --> 00:47:41.732]  So I collected the emails and set up a list called the Drudge Report.
[00:47:42.432 --> 00:47:43.773]  One reader turned into five.
[00:47:45.267 --> 00:47:46.427]  Then turned into a hundred.
[00:47:47.448 --> 00:47:51.149]  And faster than you could say, I never had sex with that woman, it was a thousand.
[00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:52.870]  Five thousand.
[00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:54.111]  A hundred thousand people.
[00:47:55.011 --> 00:47:57.732]  The ensuing website practically launched itself.
[00:47:58.733 --> 00:48:01.094]  Last month I had six million visitors.
[00:48:02.114 --> 00:48:03.975]  And I currently have a daily average
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:07.782]  Larger than the weekly newsstand sales of Time Magazine.
[00:48:08.002 --> 00:48:09.263]  Check out these numbers.
[00:48:09.383 --> 00:48:18.469]  About 33 million visits in just the last 24 hours alone, almost 900 million in the last month, and get this, over 11 billion in the last year.
[00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:24.494]  Some people love him, some people hate him, and the White House may fear him because they can't control him.
[00:48:25.434 --> 00:48:27.376]  Anyone, for any reason, can launch a website.
[00:48:27.656 --> 00:48:29.777]  Little or no money, internet connection, local phone.
[00:48:30.378 --> 00:48:31.959]  The modem lets you cover the world.
[00:48:32.796 --> 00:48:38.700]  The modem lets you read what's happening if there's an earthquake in Alaska seconds after it happens.
[00:48:39.381 --> 00:48:40.641]  I think that's fun and dramatic.
[00:48:40.942 --> 00:48:41.462]  For free.
[00:48:42.443 --> 00:48:44.944]  By a medium that was built by taxpayer money.
[00:48:46.245 --> 00:48:47.926]  So, perfectly realized.
[00:48:48.447 --> 00:48:51.349]  And, again, let the future begin.
[00:48:52.538 --> 00:48:56.322]  Anyway you look at it, Matt Drudge is now a global icon.
[00:48:56.863 --> 00:48:58.805]  Not just here in the United States, but worldwide.
[00:48:59.206 --> 00:49:06.474]  He is an example of independent, true media challenging the Goliath state-run systems.
[00:49:07.175 --> 00:49:13.082]  Matt Drudge is a visionary and a futurist, and I admire him because he's a folk hero.
[00:49:13.502 --> 00:49:25.872]  He's a grassroots person who was able to basically leverage his instinct for the pulse of the people and change the way the world sees news and information.
[00:49:26.372 --> 00:49:42.025]  And he's also had the courage to not just carry Infowars.com stories, but countless other grassroots media stories and really change the narrative towards one that is more based on reality and empowering the people and liberty.
[00:49:42.665 --> 00:49:50.033]  Matt Drudge is classic Americana, and he's a great example not just to our generation, but future generations to come.
[00:49:50.493 --> 00:49:59.763]  And when the history books are written on the info wars and the media wars of the 20th and 21st century, Matt Drudge's name will be right there at the center.
