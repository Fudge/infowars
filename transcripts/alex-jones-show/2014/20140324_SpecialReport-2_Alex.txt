[00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.554]  About half of American adults believe in at least one medical conspiracy theory, according to a new survey.
[00:00:13.715 --> 00:00:24.963]  The study, titled Medical Conspiracy Theories and Health Behaviors in the United States, said many people believe in conspiracy theories since they are easier to understand than the complex medical information.
[00:00:25.243 --> 00:00:28.626]  In other words, your feeble mind can't grasp science.
[00:00:28.906 --> 00:00:34.651]  So let's take a look at these crazy conspiracy theories participants were asked about and separate fact from fiction.
[00:00:35.091 --> 00:00:39.976]  Did the CIA infect a large portion of African Americans with the AIDS virus?
[00:00:40.297 --> 00:00:47.865]  While there's no evidence to prove or debunk this particular theory, I wouldn't put it past the spy agency considering the fact that the U.S.
[00:00:47.925 --> 00:00:54.412]  Public Health Service did inject African American men with syphilis during the infamous Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment.
[00:00:54.932 --> 00:01:09.815]  The clinical study started in 1932 and for the next 40 years African-American men who thought they were receiving free health care from the government were actually being injected with syphilis in order to study the natural progression of the disease if left untreated.
[00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:15.857]  The men all subsequently died from syphilis and their families were never told that they could have been treated.
[00:01:16.437 --> 00:01:29.316]  Also a fact, the FDA helped to cover for pharmaceutical companies that knowingly sold millions of dollars worth of contaminated medicine to other countries in the mid-80s, although they knew that it was tainted with AIDS.
[00:01:29.873 --> 00:01:40.299]  Internal documents show that after this company positively, absolutely knew that they had a medication that was infected with the AIDS virus, they took the product off the market in the U.S.
[00:01:40.339 --> 00:01:43.300]  and then they dumped it in France, Europe, Asia, and Latin America.
[00:01:43.661 --> 00:01:45.241]  The medicine's called Factor 8.
[00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:50.024]  It was an injection medicine that was used for hemophiliacs, mostly children.
[00:01:50.184 --> 00:01:52.085]  Children had been born with an incurable disease.
[00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:52.746]  Hold on, hold on, Mike.
[00:01:52.906 --> 00:01:53.546]  Hold on, hold on.
[00:01:53.686 --> 00:02:04.088]  So you're telling me that Bayer knew that this drug was infected with the AIDS virus, they yanked it from the market in America, and then they dumped it in markets overseas?
[00:02:04.408 --> 00:02:09.329]  They had to figure out a way, Joe, to make a profit on a product that they could not sell in America.
[00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:17.711]  Doctors and governments still want to vaccinate children, even though they know these vaccines cause autism and other psychological disorders.
[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.022]  After he got the shot, he got violently ill.
[00:02:20.462 --> 00:02:25.226]  Lori Webb says her son, 19-year-old Chandler Webb, was the picture of perfect health.
[00:02:25.706 --> 00:02:32.292]  However, the day after his first ever flu shot, he became very ill and was in a coma within 24 hours.
[00:02:32.592 --> 00:02:38.758]  Chandler's family ultimately elected to take him off life support, and he died after 28 days in the hospital.
[00:02:39.118 --> 00:02:41.800]  It's 50 to 70 percent effective against it.
[00:02:42.181 --> 00:02:44.503]  If you do get the flu, it'll be a lot less.
[00:02:45.063 --> 00:02:45.964]  I had to learn how to walk again.
[00:03:06.516 --> 00:03:12.720]  When we look at vaccinations, this country vaccinates children at a rate higher than anywhere in the entire world.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.843]  They get something like 46 different antigen exposures before they start school.
[00:03:19.344 --> 00:03:24.226]  They're getting 26 to 30 by age one.
[00:03:24.567 --> 00:03:32.471]  I've made the case in a number of articles I've published in Peer Reviewed Germ that this is very harmful to the brain.
[00:03:32.972 --> 00:03:35.233]  I've outlined the mechanism by which it does it.
[00:03:36.656 --> 00:03:44.057]  And yet the policy continues and every day we see the federal government pushing more vaccinations.
[00:03:44.901 --> 00:03:53.890]  In collusion with the pharmaceutical companies that are making high profits off of it, international organizations are pushing it, and you have to ask why.
[00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.972]  There's only two choices you have in this debate.
[00:03:57.093 --> 00:04:08.003]  Either they're incredibly stupid and incompetent, or criminal, or they're doing it on purpose for a reason, which goes back to the Rockefeller design of human engineering.
[00:04:08.268 --> 00:04:09.689]  Then look at the polio vaccine.
[00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:19.153]  The CDC admitted that up to 30 million Americans could have received a polio vaccine contaminated with SV40, a virus that can lead to cancer in humans.
[00:04:19.573 --> 00:04:27.077]  In this shocking footage, a top Merck vaccine scientist openly admits the presence of deadly SV40 in polio vaccines.
[00:04:27.757 --> 00:04:31.179]  Tell me how you found SV40 in the polio vaccine.
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.881]  Well, that was a Merck thing.
[00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:35.621]  Yeah, I came to Merck.
[00:04:38.968 --> 00:04:41.069]  I was going to develop vaccines.
[00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:43.809]  And we had wild viruses in those days.
[00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.630]  Remember the wild monkey kidney viruses and so forth.
[00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.031]  And I finally, after six months, gave up.
[00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:53.472]  I said that you cannot develop vaccines with these damn monkeys.
[00:04:53.732 --> 00:04:54.652]  We're finished.
[00:04:55.652 --> 00:04:58.173]  And if I can't do something about it, I'm going to quit.
[00:04:58.273 --> 00:04:59.013]  I'm going to try it.
[00:04:59.954 --> 00:05:01.054]  He said, you go ahead.
[00:05:02.274 --> 00:05:03.955]  Get your monkeys out of West Africa.
[00:05:03.995 --> 00:05:05.175]  Get the African green.
[00:05:05.953 --> 00:05:07.073]  Bring them into Madrid.
[00:05:07.833 --> 00:05:08.634]  Onload them there.
[00:05:08.694 --> 00:05:10.914]  There are no other traffic through there for animals.
[00:05:11.274 --> 00:05:12.654]  Fly them into Philadelphia.
[00:05:12.694 --> 00:05:13.094]  Pick them up.
[00:05:13.314 --> 00:05:14.775]  So I brought African Greens.
[00:05:14.855 --> 00:05:18.596]  I didn't know we were importing AIDS virus at the time.
[00:05:19.576 --> 00:05:22.576]  No, it was you who introduced AIDS virus to the country.
[00:05:22.616 --> 00:05:23.216]  No, that's right.
[00:05:23.256 --> 00:05:27.357]  But yellow fever vaccine had leukemia virus and everything.
[00:05:27.417 --> 00:05:30.358]  You know, this is in the days of very crude science.
[00:05:31.818 --> 00:05:32.838]  I said, well, I'll tell you what.
[00:05:32.858 --> 00:05:35.559]  I said, I have a feeling in my bones that this virus
[00:05:36.542 --> 00:05:37.163]  It's different.
[00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:40.908]  I don't know why to tell you this, but I've been around Bonozzio a long time.
[00:05:41.008 --> 00:05:43.531]  I just think this virus may have some long-term effects.
[00:05:43.731 --> 00:05:45.934]  And he said, what?
[00:05:46.675 --> 00:05:50.460]  I said, cancer.
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:51.942]  I love it.
[00:05:52.002 --> 00:05:52.442]  I love it.
[00:05:52.502 --> 00:05:52.863]  Go ahead.
[00:05:53.988 --> 00:06:00.994]  The jokes that were going around was, gee, we would win the Olympics because the Russians would all be loaded down with tumors.
[00:06:03.156 --> 00:06:05.178]  This is where the vaccine was being tested.
[00:06:05.218 --> 00:06:05.598]  This was 100%.
[00:06:05.738 --> 00:06:05.998]  Right.
[00:06:10.223 --> 00:06:10.763]  Are U.S.
[00:06:10.843 --> 00:06:13.824]  regulators preventing people from getting natural cures?
[00:06:14.264 --> 00:06:23.066]  Apparently, the big government Big Pharma cabal in Washington would have you believe that drug makers only have your best interests in mind, not their profits or power.
[00:06:23.486 --> 00:06:31.808]  Covering for Bayer after the company sold AIDS-laden drugs to other countries is just one shocking piece of evidence that the FDA is Big Pharma's lapdog.
[00:06:32.088 --> 00:06:39.131]  According to the FDA's legal definition, a drug is anything that diagnoses, cures, mitigates, treats, or prevents a disease.
[00:06:39.271 --> 00:06:47.454]  What is not explicitly permitted as a medicine by the FDA's totalitarian legal regulatory control is implicitly forbidden.
[00:06:47.734 --> 00:06:50.015]  So how does a drug company get FDA approval?
[00:06:50.595 --> 00:06:51.336]  Well, they buy them off.
[00:06:51.656 --> 00:07:01.626]  Congressional passage of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act in 1992 basically allows drug companies to purchase approval for drugs from the FDA through drug application user fees.
[00:07:01.906 --> 00:07:07.431]  The average out-of-pocket cost for obtaining a new drug approval is $802 million.
[00:07:07.672 --> 00:07:10.935]  Cancer rates have remained unchanged.
[00:07:12.461 --> 00:07:22.235]  After $25 billion of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs a year, the heart disease rates are unchanged.
[00:07:23.397 --> 00:07:23.838]  And yet,
[00:07:24.557 --> 00:07:42.514]  While we let the MDs direct our health care, arthritis increases, high blood pressure increases, fibromyalgia increases, Alzheimer's rises from obscurity to the sixth leading cause of death, and one out of 80 kids now are born autistic.
[00:07:43.334 --> 00:07:46.017]  And we give the MDs a pass.
[00:07:48.533 --> 00:07:50.254]  So what is approved by the FDA?
[00:07:50.694 --> 00:08:04.742]  Well, in addition to blasting the body with toxic chemicals and radiation, the FDA approves antidepressant Paxil for women suffering from breast cancer, even though Paxil has been linked to causing breast cancer tumors in women.
[00:08:05.868 --> 00:08:17.311]  Global dissemination of genetically modified foods by Monsanto is part of a secret program called Agenda 21, launched by the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations to shrink the world's population.
[00:08:17.911 --> 00:08:20.372]  First, Agenda 21 is no secret.
[00:08:20.552 --> 00:08:24.693]  You can read all about the plan for global control right from the United Nations website.
[00:08:25.493 --> 00:08:43.690]  In 1971, the Rockefeller Foundation, together with the Ford Foundation and the World Bank, established the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, which runs 16 research centers around the world, most in developing countries, spending some $350 million annually.
[00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:49.195]  The focus of CGIAR is the spread of GM crops in the developing world.
[00:08:49.855 --> 00:08:53.798]  CGIAR today operates under the umbrella of the World Bank.
[00:08:54.238 --> 00:09:01.224]  World Bank aid is administered on the basis of a recipient agreeing to impose population control policies.
[00:09:01.744 --> 00:09:06.768]  This is according to a 1974 National Security Council memorandum, NSSM 200.
[00:09:08.749 --> 00:09:09.549]  And another tell?
[00:09:09.929 --> 00:09:21.593]  While the elite push genetically modified foods on the rest of the world, it's all organic in the White House garden, and even Monsanto's own employees enjoy non-GMO food in the company cafeteria.
[00:09:22.454 --> 00:09:30.436]  Public water fluoridation is really just a secret way for chemical companies to dump the dangerous byproducts of phosphate mines into the environment.
[00:09:30.936 --> 00:09:38.259]  We know that over 20 studies, many of which come from prestigious organizations like Harvard, and are published in federal government journals,
[00:09:38.499 --> 00:09:41.160]  have told us how sodium fluoride lowers IQ.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.522]  The EPA had similar statements on the damage fluoride does to unborn babies.
[00:09:45.982 --> 00:09:47.942]  Fluoride readily crosses the placenta.
[00:09:48.143 --> 00:09:57.206]  Fluoride exposure to the developing brain, which is more susceptible to injury caused by toxicants than is the mature brain, may possibly lead to damage of a permanent nature.
[00:09:57.566 --> 00:10:05.448]  We know that a major head at the National Cancer Institute revealed decades ago that fluoride was causing cancer waves in the United States.
[00:10:05.768 --> 00:10:15.031]  We know that at the end of the Second World War, the United States government sent Charles Elliot Perkins to take charge of the vast IG Farben chemical plants in Germany.
[00:10:15.271 --> 00:10:17.152]  While there, he was told by German chemists,
[00:10:17.492 --> 00:10:17.752]  I don't know.
[00:10:35.333 --> 00:10:38.414]  So tell me again, why are we still fluoridating the water supply?
[00:10:38.875 --> 00:10:49.960]  Well, aside from its apparent use of creating a docile and sterile populace, fluoridating the water supply is an ideal environmental solution to a long-standing problem, according to the EPA.
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:59.584]  In a letter, the Deputy Assistant Administrator for Water at the EPA writes, by recovering by-product fluorosilicic acid from fertilizer manufacturing,
[00:10:59.764 --> 00:11:06.170]  Water and air pollution are minimized, and water utilities have a low-cost source of fluoride available to them.
[00:11:07.491 --> 00:11:12.916]  Health officials know cell phones cause cancer, but they don't do anything as corporations won't let them.
[00:11:13.476 --> 00:11:18.220]  Cell phones emit a form of electromagnetic field called radiofrequency radiation.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:26.768]  This radiation exposure has previously been linked to brain tumors, cancer, cardiovascular disease, depression, and other serious illnesses.
[00:11:27.088 --> 00:11:36.059]  And after a decade-long, $30 million study into cell phones, the World Health Organization found a link between long-term mobile phone use and brain tumors.
[00:11:36.399 --> 00:11:45.030]  In fact, the World Health Organization now lists mobile phone use in the same carcinogenic hazard category as lead, engine exhaust, and chloroform.
[00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:51.235]  Even cell phone manufacturers suggest users maintain a distance of a half inch or more from their cell phones.
[00:11:51.756 --> 00:11:55.979]  But these recommendations are often lost in the small print of user manuals.
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.282]  So don't worry if you're one of those crazy conspiracy theorists.
[00:11:59.702 --> 00:12:00.363]  You're not alone.
[00:12:00.783 --> 00:12:09.591]  And considering the evidence of just how manipulated the so-called health and safety czars are by power and profit, don't let anyone tell you not to ask questions.
[00:12:10.011 --> 00:12:11.913]  What you learn could just save your life.
