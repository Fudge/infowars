[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.611]  Aborted babies incinerated to heat in UK hospitals.
[00:00:19.091 --> 00:00:23.034]  Soylent Green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people.
[00:00:23.254 --> 00:00:29.478]  But now, children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals in the UK.
[00:00:29.518 --> 00:00:34.361]  They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[00:00:34.882 --> 00:00:39.485]  What is the secret of Soylent Green?
[00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:41.566]  The powdered flesh from dead babies.
[00:00:42.026 --> 00:00:44.188]  Some people believe they can cure disease.
[00:00:44.668 --> 00:00:48.691]  Because of its enormous popularity, Soylent Green is in short supply.
[00:00:49.492 --> 00:00:52.215]  Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.
[00:00:52.516 --> 00:00:55.420]  The supply of Soylent Green has been exhausted.
[00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.703]  You must evacuate the area.
[00:01:00.367 --> 00:01:12.233]  The federal court ruled that the shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Bilderberg Group Company, are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring, but we already know.
[00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:14.674]  So, enjoy the flavors!
[00:01:14.854 --> 00:01:19.336]  We're gonna get the real solution, which is gonna be a combination of death panels and sales taxes.
[00:01:19.477 --> 00:01:21.017]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[00:01:21.478 --> 00:01:22.978]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[00:01:23.338 --> 00:01:24.579]  I'm for regular suicide.
[00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.240]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:37.866]  ...is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade up in medical costs?
[00:01:37.886 --> 00:01:42.048]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:48.591]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[00:01:56.761 --> 00:01:59.002]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[00:01:59.382 --> 00:02:03.804]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[00:02:04.285 --> 00:02:06.066]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[00:02:06.786 --> 00:02:15.470]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison guards, on the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[00:02:16.151 --> 00:02:18.652]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[00:02:19.352 --> 00:02:20.733]  The scoops are on their way.
[00:02:21.473 --> 00:02:22.974]  The scoops are on their way.
[00:02:23.475 --> 00:02:26.537]  I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[00:02:27.257 --> 00:02:30.019]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life.
[00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:33.501]  You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[00:02:33.561 --> 00:02:35.002]  We've got to stop them!
[00:02:35.802 --> 00:02:40.225]  What is the secret of Soylent Green?
[00:02:40.685 --> 00:02:43.247]  Soylent Green is people!
[00:02:45.388 --> 00:02:47.510]  We're told by Vice President Joe Biden,
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:03:03.345]  That we need to just allow any children in the world to come here, that they're all our children, and that we have to pay for them and let them be wards of the state, be political operatives and voters to bring us into slavery to a greater degree.
[00:03:05.126 --> 00:03:08.807]  But then they do everything they can to kill babies before they're born.
[00:03:08.827 --> 00:03:16.830]  And the globalists do everything they can to stop the industrialization of the third world and to keep people in squalor.
[00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:36.555]  They are the last individuals to have some fake moral high ground, but that's the weapon they used on the ill-informed, shabby Western population, who is tragically hip and tragically ignorant, and in most cases aren't even conscious human beings in my view now.
[00:03:36.995 --> 00:03:41.118]  The globalists have turned them into the dehumanized vessels that they wanted all along.
[00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:45.001]  They have been turned into artificially conscious
[00:03:46.161 --> 00:03:48.163]  Biological androids, as I call them.
[00:03:49.424 --> 00:03:51.105]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, 8-8.
[00:03:51.265 --> 00:04:04.336]  It was back in 2008, on 8-8, when the Olympics kicked off, that they tried to take Russian-held areas of Georgia, since the end of World War II, and start a war.
[00:04:04.376 --> 00:04:05.037]  That failed.
[00:04:05.397 --> 00:04:07.379]  They globalized to be more successful in Ukraine.
[00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:11.963]  That does not mean, again, Russia is some paragon of goodness.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.644]  They're now coming in with the Internet ID in Russia, something the Communist Chinese have and something Obama wants.
[00:04:21.065 --> 00:04:21.486]  So there.
[00:04:24.368 --> 00:04:27.310]  There's our precious PootiePoot doing things like that.
[00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.712]  We've got a big broadcast obviously lined up for you today.
[00:04:31.072 --> 00:04:36.156]  My cousin, Buckley Hammond, will be in studio coming up at the bottom of the hour
[00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.811]  He grew up in Guatemala.
[00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:39.952]  He's a Guatemalan citizen.
[00:04:39.972 --> 00:04:41.333]  Dual citizenship with the U.S.
[00:04:41.713 --> 00:04:42.694]  Speaks fluent Spanish.
[00:04:43.454 --> 00:04:48.998]  He can tell you what the wondrous third world is like and what our children, because they're ours.
[00:04:49.078 --> 00:04:50.058]  They don't belong to Guatemala.
[00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:51.679]  They belong to you.
[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.600]  You're going to pay for them.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.962]  And then they're also going to be wards of the state.
[00:04:55.662 --> 00:04:58.684]  Then Mark Dice is going to pop in with a bunch of new stuff he's been working on.
[00:04:59.064 --> 00:04:59.965]  Media commentator.
[00:05:00.405 --> 00:05:05.769]  And then a libertarian running for office in Texas, who's a really smart lawyer, is going to be joining us as well in studio.
[00:05:07.591 --> 00:05:10.492]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:05:10.632 --> 00:05:12.593]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:18.795]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[00:05:18.975 --> 00:05:23.977]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[00:05:24.057 --> 00:05:28.759]  The new InfoWars Life silver bullet colloidal silver is the answer for you and your family.
[00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:33.441]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[00:05:33.761 --> 00:05:42.125]  The InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[00:05:42.345 --> 00:05:44.286]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[00:05:44.506 --> 00:05:55.611]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water.
[00:05:55.691 --> 00:06:03.094]  For your preparedness storage or your home kitchen, purchase your bottle of InfoWarsLife.com Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver today.
[00:06:03.334 --> 00:06:07.036]  And find other amazing supplements at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:06:07.696 --> 00:06:10.538]  This is Leanne McAdoo for InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:06:10.798 --> 00:06:16.700]  I'm here with Dr. Edward Group, Master Herbologist and Chief Formulator behind the InfoWarsLife products.
[00:06:16.921 --> 00:06:21.343]  Dr. Group, what have you been hearing from women who've started taking Super Female Vitality?
[00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:27.986]  You know, we've heard the reviews and feedback from Super Male Vitality from emails to even excited callers on the radio.
[00:06:28.286 --> 00:06:30.187]  Now, the answer for women is here.
[00:06:30.327 --> 00:06:41.851]  A new formulation specifically designed for the female body, Super Female Vitality, delivers 10 key herbs that work synergistically to revitalize the unique biology of women.
[00:06:41.971 --> 00:06:43.972]  I'm so glad that you guys made this for women.
[00:06:43.992 --> 00:06:49.534]  When he brought me home, the bottle of Super Female, I had tons of energy, tons of motivation, a lot of drive.
[00:06:49.574 --> 00:06:50.795]  My husband thinks I've been in a better mood.
[00:06:50.855 --> 00:06:53.356]  Our relationship, all I can say is this is a lot better now.
[00:06:53.696 --> 00:06:57.839]  I've just started taking super female vitality from Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:06.846]  Supplies are limited, so secure yours today at Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or dial 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:08.166 --> 00:07:11.889]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:13.210]  I didn't, I taste dirt in it.
[00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.251]  God knows what's in this.
[00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:18.652]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:24.575]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a ProPure® G2.0 filtration system.
[00:07:24.595 --> 00:07:25.715]  That one is better.
[00:07:25.795 --> 00:07:26.735]  Tastes like nothing.
[00:07:27.036 --> 00:07:28.396]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[00:07:28.416 --> 00:07:28.996]  It's good water.
[00:07:29.116 --> 00:07:34.858]  Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[00:07:35.078 --> 00:07:42.061]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lowered IQ, and even cancer.
[00:07:42.321 --> 00:07:44.803]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[00:07:45.004 --> 00:07:52.931]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[00:07:52.951 --> 00:07:54.072]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[00:07:54.232 --> 00:07:55.113]  It's good water.
[00:07:55.293 --> 00:07:55.754]  Refreshing.
[00:07:55.894 --> 00:07:56.274]  It's good!
[00:07:56.534 --> 00:07:58.797]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today.
[00:07:59.037 --> 00:08:02.720]  Use promo code WATER and save 10% off your ProPure® purchase.
[00:08:03.041 --> 00:08:03.541]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:08:19.404 --> 00:08:22.429]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:27.156]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:37.222 --> 00:08:43.026]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this 8th day of August, 2014.
[00:08:43.066 --> 00:08:45.969]  This is our Live Friday edition.
[00:08:46.909 --> 00:08:49.951]  I will be in studio this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:08:50.052 --> 00:09:01.060]  Central, live from the Infowars.com News Center, deep in the heart of Texas, coming to you from FEMA Region 6, from Austin.
[00:09:02.781 --> 00:09:05.143]  Wow, where to begin yet again?
[00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:08.705]  Mark Dice, media commentator with a lot of breaking intel joining us.
[00:09:09.646 --> 00:09:13.488]  We also have other guests coming on later in the transmission as well.
[00:09:14.048 --> 00:09:16.689]  My cousin Buckley Hammond will be in studio.
[00:09:17.049 --> 00:09:19.170]  He was born and grew up in Guatemala.
[00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:21.211]  He has dual Guatemalan citizenship.
[00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:28.615]  And I thought you should hear from him just the stories of living in Guatemala, I guess, until he was six or seven years old.
[00:09:30.171 --> 00:09:36.335]  And just routinely the market being blown up, cars being machine gunned off the road, his brother kidnapped.
[00:09:38.096 --> 00:09:43.079]  This is what it's like to live in a middle-class area with your own property in Guatemala.
[00:09:45.347 --> 00:09:48.189]  So we're going to hear all about that coming up.
[00:09:48.209 --> 00:09:52.013]  And of course, Joe Biden says all children in the world are our children.
[00:09:52.053 --> 00:09:59.179]  He means Democratic Party's children, and they must be brought into the state, raised by the state, and given positions in the state.
[00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:12.370]  They are that national security force, just as big, just as strong as our military, and a bunch of White House run Democratic Party websites and news services came out when I talked about that a few weeks ago with our guest.
[00:10:13.114 --> 00:10:19.918]  Who was on air and said, oh, look how crazy they are claiming these kids are a political force to take over like a Hitler youth.
[00:10:20.579 --> 00:10:22.180]  That's in the future.
[00:10:23.921 --> 00:10:28.343]  That's what major political scientists at UC Davis and others are saying.
[00:10:28.664 --> 00:10:39.770]  But more importantly, that's what the Ford Foundation said back in the 60s they were going to do with Henry Ford's money after he'd been gone a while was to break the country up and do just what's happening.
[00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:40.651]  We've been warning of it.
[00:10:41.769 --> 00:10:43.450]  So we've got all the latest news on that.
[00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:44.250]  A clip coming up.
[00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:49.753]  Border Patrol agent, senior agent, these people are coming here to do horrible things.
[00:10:50.773 --> 00:10:54.195]  And that integrates in with another clip.
[00:10:54.235 --> 00:10:58.597]  Mainstream media says Americans against wide open borders are anti-immigration.
[00:11:00.298 --> 00:11:04.780]  We just don't want to lose our citizenship and become total vassals of this new world order.
[00:11:06.604 --> 00:11:15.271]  Just like I'm against this Pacific Treaty, this Asian Pacific Treaty that's got 30 parts, only one part's been released, that ends internet freedom.
[00:11:16.252 --> 00:11:25.580]  And it allows corporations that run the treaty, and are setting up the new global government, to merge with the EU and the North American Union, to control everything!
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.141]  And the treaty is secret!
[00:11:28.582 --> 00:11:34.567]  By the way, Australians, in their news at least, are freaking out about this, and just put a new government in.
[00:11:36.403 --> 00:11:37.864]  And are repealing the carbon tax.
[00:11:38.964 --> 00:11:51.608]  And I'm not saying there's some paragon, because they've gone deeper down the rat hole in some ways than we have under globalism, but they're freaking out over their government secretly signing on to treaties that they're not allowed to see.
[00:11:53.209 --> 00:11:57.671]  I mean, that is the definition of a totalitarian system.
[00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:01.472]  And they boil it down to, oh, you don't like children, huh?
[00:12:04.821 --> 00:12:05.962]  There you go, there's the headline.
[00:12:06.222 --> 00:12:06.642]  Boom!
[00:12:07.103 --> 00:12:11.105]  July 17th, Australia becomes first developed nation, repeal carbon tax.
[00:12:13.927 --> 00:12:33.480]  He pledged to get rid of it last year, he got elected in a landslide, and the system already taps his phone and knows this, but I have it from three different high-level sources that their new leader in Australia wants to restore their Second Amendment, their right to guns, his anti-New World Order, and wants prosperity for their country the old-fashioned way.
[00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:35.984]  Just got chills, folks.
[00:12:36.304 --> 00:12:52.795]  Very exciting to have closet info warriors out there all over the place who are not going to put up with this garbage anymore, who aren't going to pay the Rothschilds and Rockefellers and the UN their carbon tax, who want prosperity like America used to want!
[00:12:55.577 --> 00:12:57.018]  These victories get me so excited!
[00:12:59.244 --> 00:13:00.566]  Because we can turn this around.
[00:13:00.606 --> 00:13:01.827]  I still know we can.
[00:13:02.368 --> 00:13:03.870]  Yes, the West is corrupt.
[00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:05.412]  Yes, the world is declining.
[00:13:06.013 --> 00:13:07.174]  Yes, there's a lot of problems.
[00:13:07.234 --> 00:13:14.643]  But we've got to try to fix things because it's too serious if we let the full collapse happen.
[00:13:15.685 --> 00:13:16.406]  It's too horrible.
[00:13:17.475 --> 00:13:32.608]  We've got to struggle even in the collapse so that people know we struggled and we tried to fix things so we build systems at a micro level that can be duplicated to try to restore civilization, restore honor, and an age of chivalry to go to the stars.
[00:13:33.189 --> 00:13:38.434]  And to let our children and grandchildren enjoy the true fruits of technology, the life extension,
[00:13:40.345 --> 00:13:47.747]  And to allow all this high-tech to develop true transparency and culture, and it could be a new golden age, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:49.447 --> 00:13:54.129]  Instead of the globalist, new age, dark age, counterfeit system of total enslavement.
[00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:59.410]  The New World Order always has counterfeits within counterfeits, and I'm going to get to all the huge news.
[00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:05.972]  The Illuminati, founded in the 1770s, was set up long before 1776.
[00:14:09.019 --> 00:14:13.423]  In Germany and France, on record, is a real organization, real society.
[00:14:15.745 --> 00:14:18.668]  And it has vestigial organizations today that I'm going to break down here in a moment.
[00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:34.403]  But they went out, and of course, a letter carrier got struck with lightning with high-level, decompartmentalized, command-level orders from Adam Weishaupt for Illuminati leaders in Germany and France, only about 14 of them.
[00:14:37.059 --> 00:15:01.646]  To pose as freedom lovers, to pose as people that wanted to bring in a system of renaissance, to pose as folks that wanted to overthrow the corrupt monarchies, when in truth all Adam Weishaupt and others wanted was to overthrow the existing order to bring in their order of 1984 literal total oppression, trampled and being trampled upon.
[00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:10.555]  So you go to the technicals, those of us that really want liberty and freedom, you can call the Illuminati.
[00:15:12.437 --> 00:15:21.005]  Because we're the type of people who just want freedom and family rights and the right to self-defense and individualism.
[00:15:21.803 --> 00:15:39.095]  Well, the globalists came in, the proto-globalists, the Jacobins, of 250 years ago, they saw a renaissance leading to revolution all over the world, to bring in a new, expanded renaissance, so they simply tried to hijack the revolutionary fervor that was already there.
[00:15:39.415 --> 00:15:40.376]  Where have you seen that before?
[00:15:42.457 --> 00:15:44.799]  Real beef with Russia in Ukraine?
[00:15:45.099 --> 00:15:49.202]  Globalists hijack that, bring in a George Soros, EU takeover system.
[00:15:50.452 --> 00:15:52.613]  To replace one tyranny with one even far worse.
[00:15:53.573 --> 00:15:55.714]  A lot of Arabs want freedom across the Middle East.
[00:15:57.115 --> 00:15:58.256]  They're tired of being oppressed.
[00:15:58.276 --> 00:16:00.597]  They're tired of whatever different issues they're dealing with.
[00:16:01.137 --> 00:16:03.398]  Come in with Google and Facebook and Twitter.
[00:16:03.798 --> 00:16:04.899]  Game the revolution.
[00:16:05.139 --> 00:16:13.723]  Put Al-Qaeda light and IS and Muslim Brotherhood in control to bring down all the existing systems that had stability and freedom compared to what they now have.
[00:16:14.103 --> 00:16:15.764]  And brand it as freedom.
[00:16:17.992 --> 00:16:21.594]  So that's why I've said before, and people have taken it out of context as they do, I don't care.
[00:16:21.634 --> 00:16:22.715]  I expect liars to do that.
[00:16:22.895 --> 00:16:23.195]  Fine.
[00:16:23.576 --> 00:16:25.577]  People will then see that, come here and find the truth.
[00:16:30.019 --> 00:16:34.022]  That you could say that, yes, George Washington was in the Illuminati.
[00:16:35.063 --> 00:16:38.585]  You could say, I'm in the Illuminati, but I don't go to any secret meetings.
[00:16:39.385 --> 00:16:41.847]  I'm not a part of any secret organization.
[00:16:43.206 --> 00:16:46.487]  But, I believe in human elimination.
[00:16:47.108 --> 00:16:48.268]  I believe in light.
[00:16:49.049 --> 00:16:50.149]  I believe in freedom.
[00:16:50.729 --> 00:16:51.890]  I believe in justice.
[00:16:53.851 --> 00:16:55.251]  I believe in transparency.
[00:16:56.852 --> 00:16:59.273]  I believe in the right of free association.
[00:16:59.733 --> 00:17:06.156]  And George Washington and many got sucked into the Illuminati, on record, for a few years.
[00:17:08.291 --> 00:17:18.135]  But then they turned against it, and George Washington turned against the French Illuminist, and wrote scores of letters that are public, that you can read at the Library of Congress.
[00:17:18.155 --> 00:17:23.817]  Just type in George Washington's Letters to the Illuminati, click Google Images, and you'll see hundreds of copies.
[00:17:24.057 --> 00:17:27.319]  You can follow the links to the Library of Congress.
[00:17:29.557 --> 00:17:37.283]  I've actually gone to the Library of Congress and been allowed in, because they have them on display, in his papers, and was allowed to even look at them six years ago.
[00:17:37.924 --> 00:17:51.415]  I have looked, through the glass, at his letters, saying how evil the Illuminati is, how they hijack liberty movements, how they're there to really bring in a tyranny, to overthrow one tyranny to replace it with one far worse.
[00:17:55.430 --> 00:18:00.194]  So again, the reason I bring that up is they're masters of infiltrating.
[00:18:00.254 --> 00:18:01.275]  They're masters.
[00:18:05.666 --> 00:18:06.987]  of hijacking things.
[00:18:07.487 --> 00:18:09.449]  But in the end, they don't deliver.
[00:18:09.549 --> 00:18:11.851]  Like Obama, claiming all this change.
[00:18:11.991 --> 00:18:16.454]  Or Bush, claiming he wouldn't be involved in foreign entanglements and wanted to cut the government.
[00:18:16.614 --> 00:18:17.615]  Or Bill Clinton.
[00:18:18.035 --> 00:18:19.676]  They all work for the same combine.
[00:18:19.696 --> 00:18:20.597]  And here's the headlines.
[00:18:21.057 --> 00:18:25.140]  CNN poll, trust in government at all time low.
[00:18:27.102 --> 00:18:29.283]  Remember Infowars.com last week?
[00:18:30.424 --> 00:18:32.706]  Linking to foreign news and foreign documents?
[00:18:35.157 --> 00:18:57.108]  Showing that the Ebola outbreak was already a pandemic, and then it was being covered up, and then DrudgeReport.com linked to our story, and then it was forced to be picked up, and now the head of Good Samaritan was on C-SPAN criticizing Drudge, saying, yes, it's true, it's a pandemic, but Drudge shouldn't be telling people about it.
[00:18:57.508 --> 00:19:01.370]  Yeah, let's not tell people so they can get prepared in case something happens.
[00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:05.882]  Let's keep people in the dark, you see.
[00:19:05.902 --> 00:19:09.264]  And that's what the Illuminati does.
[00:19:09.904 --> 00:19:12.045]  The bad Illuminati.
[00:19:12.385 --> 00:19:16.347]  The real Illuminati.
[00:19:16.608 --> 00:19:28.734]  They say they're trying to protect you by keeping you in the dark, and now they've got people testifying in Congress that DrudgeReport.com linked to Infowars.com
[00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:40.897]  And other articles, some of them mainstream, proving there was a cover-up, and then they admit, yes, there was a cover-up, but we're bad for telling the truth.
[00:19:41.457 --> 00:19:47.183]  Meanwhile, the UN has now come out and said, Ebola is an international health emergency, World Health Organization.
[00:19:47.203 --> 00:19:52.109]  So, sorry we told you about it a week and three days before it was mainstream.
[00:19:52.129 --> 00:19:52.689]  I apologize.
[00:19:53.983 --> 00:19:55.624]  And, uh, you know, sorry about everything else, too.
[00:19:55.764 --> 00:20:04.088]  By the way, Drudge linked to our article in our video, uh, that we first found and made it go viral, of the cop saying, I don't have to follow the Constitution because Obama doesn't.
[00:20:04.408 --> 00:20:07.569]  That's now on CNN, Fox News, you name it, and the cop has resigned.
[00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:12.272]  Summer is here, and nothing looks better than tan skin and white teeth.
[00:20:12.592 --> 00:20:15.893]  Hi, I'm Jonathan Greenhut, the CEO of PowerSwabs.

[00:21:07.378 --> 00:21:14.504]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:21:14.604 --> 00:21:16.746]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:21:16.946 --> 00:21:22.110]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:27.354]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:21:27.454 --> 00:21:30.537]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:21:30.837 --> 00:21:34.699]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:39.220]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:49.365]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:21:49.585 --> 00:21:53.906]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[00:21:54.026 --> 00:22:00.429]  The new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[00:22:07.633 --> 00:22:08.473]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:22:08.633 --> 00:22:13.956]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:22:14.156 --> 00:22:14.596]  I get it.
[00:22:14.716 --> 00:22:21.920]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout cash
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:24.061]  That Social Security would be there for you.
[00:22:24.301 --> 00:22:25.481]  That's not what's happening.
[00:22:25.682 --> 00:22:30.103]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[00:22:30.283 --> 00:22:31.944]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value.
[00:22:32.104 --> 00:22:33.885]  Or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:22:34.125 --> 00:22:37.386]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:22:37.526 --> 00:22:41.568]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:22:41.768 --> 00:22:43.329]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:22:43.369 --> 00:22:46.570]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:50.912]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:22:51.092 --> 00:22:51.813]  You should, too.
[00:22:51.993 --> 00:22:52.955]  Find out what they know.
[00:22:53.135 --> 00:22:56.440]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:56.500]  800-686-2237.
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:56.800]  800-686-2237.
[00:22:56.861 --> 00:22:57.041]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:06.598 --> 00:23:09.559]  Teenagers like me used to think our parents were just weird.
[00:23:10.159 --> 00:23:14.060]  Because they put their phones and computers inside those flimsy little fake leather cases.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.521]  Then my folks both got a Blocket Pocket.
[00:23:16.841 --> 00:23:19.261]  Mom knows it keeps her safe from the phone's radiation.
[00:23:19.621 --> 00:23:21.922]  Dad knows it keeps his information private.
[00:23:22.282 --> 00:23:24.863]  I like my Blocket Pocket because it blocks hacking and tracking.
[00:23:25.283 --> 00:23:25.803]  Awesome!
[00:23:26.223 --> 00:23:28.584]  BlocketPocket.com has other cool stuff too.
[00:23:28.984 --> 00:23:30.884]  Huh, guess my parents aren't so weird.
[00:23:31.104 --> 00:23:33.585]  Get your Blocket Pocket at BlocketPocket.com.
[00:23:36.209 --> 00:23:39.811]  Get the most important package of information you'll ever receive in your life for only $10.
[00:23:39.931 --> 00:23:45.734]  The package includes three books and seven DVD programs which cover biblical miracles and prophecy.
[00:23:45.954 --> 00:23:50.677]  The Shroud of Turin, The Third Secret of Fatima, What Really Happened to the Catholic Church, and more.
[00:23:50.857 --> 00:23:51.157]  Call 800-513-0029.
[00:23:51.197 --> 00:23:51.397]  That's 800-513-0029.
[00:23:51.457 --> 00:23:52.518]  Or go to VaticanCatholic.com.
[00:23:52.558 --> 00:23:53.358]  That's VaticanCatholic.com.
[00:23:53.378 --> 00:23:53.418]  800-513-0029.
[00:23:53.438 --> 00:23:53.819]  VaticanCatholic.com.
[00:24:26.297 --> 00:24:30.279]  This is bigger than Ebola at the estimated 1,000 plus people that have it.
[00:24:30.319 --> 00:24:32.799]  That's a conservative number with it spreading.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:37.841]  And again, I'm not saying Ebola is going to come kill us here or even going to break out here.
[00:24:38.462 --> 00:24:47.805]  All I know is that they've never brought it in someone who's a vector, who is contaminated and can spread it to the United States, to Spain, to Germany.
[00:24:49.086 --> 00:24:52.327]  And there's a lot of weird PSYOP stuff going on and some big
[00:24:53.786 --> 00:25:09.514]  Genetic engineering companies were looking at with these vaccines and treatments that this may be the primer for a contrived outbreak or something down the road to try to make literally hundreds of billions of dollars off of an Ebola vaccine that they can then piggyback something else into.
[00:25:10.074 --> 00:25:11.775]  The reason we say that, they've done this before.
[00:25:11.855 --> 00:25:14.036]  They've been caught adding stuff to vaccines.
[00:25:14.376 --> 00:25:16.857]  They've been caught releasing things before.
[00:25:16.877 --> 00:25:18.077]  I mean, it's been declassified.
[00:25:18.157 --> 00:25:19.058]  Everybody knows about that.
[00:25:21.343 --> 00:25:37.221]  The H1N1 was a viral simulant for a genetically engineered dialed down virus to simulate flu spread the year before they officially released it and called it a pandemic when it wasn't a pandemic.
[00:25:39.548 --> 00:25:46.653]  Then they rolled out the vaccine that had incredible health problems and lowered immune systems according to the Canadian government.
[00:25:46.913 --> 00:26:03.324]  Then I had Wolfgang, I think it was Wudar gone, I forget the exact, I'm going from memory, the head of the EU Commission, check that for me, because there's two different Wolfgangs, I may have conflated one of them, to say that it was genetically engineered, that they'd looked at it, and that it was all a big staged event.
[00:26:05.162 --> 00:26:06.303]  Well here's this headline.
[00:26:06.703 --> 00:26:16.008]  Samaritan's Purse chief admits Ebola out of control, close quote, slams Drudge for reporting it.
[00:26:16.028 --> 00:26:19.109]  I look at the Drudge report.
[00:26:22.631 --> 00:26:24.032]  It can drive a lot of panic.
[00:26:24.472 --> 00:26:26.253]  So we have Geraldo Rivera
[00:26:28.925 --> 00:26:33.889]  And we have congressional testimony bashing the Drudge Report.
[00:26:33.929 --> 00:26:35.550]  And again, why do I defend the Drudge Report so much?
[00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:45.136]  Not just that Matt Drudge is a trailblazer and links to our news stories that keep being proven to be accurate, and he believed in us and did the research and knows we're at least trying to get it right.
[00:26:45.157 --> 00:26:46.117]  We make mistakes sometimes.
[00:26:47.178 --> 00:26:51.441]  So we're in the same boat in many respects, and we're libertarian paleoconservatives, I think it's fair to say.
[00:26:53.202 --> 00:26:54.063]  Constitutionalist.
[00:26:56.803 --> 00:26:58.364]  But we're in the same boat.
[00:26:58.704 --> 00:27:04.368]  If they can take down Drudge, you got the Pentagon talking about him, you got the White House doing it, they can take everybody down.
[00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:19.837]  And it just shows how the elite aren't all powerful, that Drudge was linking to German newspapers, French newspapers, Infowars.com, analyst experts coming out and saying they're covering up the Ebola.
[00:27:20.057 --> 00:27:21.378]  It was credible what we were saying.
[00:27:21.678 --> 00:27:22.839]  It's been confirmed today.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:31.181]  by the World Health Organization that, yes, it's a pandemic, yes, it's a crisis, yes, it's worse than we thought.
[00:27:31.241 --> 00:27:33.222]  Well, it's come out they were covering it up.
[00:27:33.662 --> 00:27:34.322]  We were right.
[00:27:34.602 --> 00:27:38.943]  These articles ran last week, early last week, middle of last week, through the weekend.
[00:27:38.963 --> 00:27:40.844]  Geraldo Rivera freaked out.
[00:27:42.584 --> 00:27:43.724]  A bunch of people freaked out.
[00:27:45.545 --> 00:27:47.045]  But we're just reporting the truth.
[00:27:49.406 --> 00:27:52.667]  And now they admit we're correct, but Drudge is bad.
[00:27:52.887 --> 00:27:54.387]  And again, Drudge is now the figurehead.
[00:27:55.595 --> 00:27:58.437]  of independent, non-state-run media.
[00:27:58.817 --> 00:28:15.386]  You gotta pick one figurehead worldwide, like Ron Paul's the figurehead of libertarianism, Matt Drudge is the figurehead, but also there's a real person behind it, but still the symbol, the flag of internet freedom, libertarian type ideas.
[00:28:15.887 --> 00:28:17.628]  So, they're all hating him.
[00:28:18.688 --> 00:28:20.970]  We have to recognize that because we have power.
[00:28:21.906 --> 00:28:22.926]  Because we're effective.
[00:28:23.587 --> 00:28:25.007]  I want you to know the good news.
[00:28:25.588 --> 00:28:27.308]  The government has the lowest approval rating ever.
[00:28:27.328 --> 00:28:28.809]  I'm going to cover that after the break.
[00:28:28.829 --> 00:28:30.209]  Let's go to this Good Samaritan clip.
[00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:37.873]  Again, I will say that Ebola is out of control in West Africa, and we are starting to see panic now around the world.
[00:28:38.013 --> 00:28:38.673]  People want to know.
[00:28:38.693 --> 00:28:40.013]  I don't know about you folks.
[00:28:40.073 --> 00:28:41.234]  I look at the Drudge Report.
[00:28:41.654 --> 00:28:42.735]  It can drive a lot of panic.
[00:28:43.675 --> 00:28:50.418]  And, you know, there's a guy in New York, there's a woman in England, there's six people had been tested in the United States.
[00:28:51.617 --> 00:28:56.020]  There are reports that there are 340 Peace Corps workers coming back.
[00:28:56.721 --> 00:28:59.022]  I greatly appreciate the help of the CDC.
[00:28:59.062 --> 00:29:08.789]  They have in fact, Dr. Frieden and I personally have spoken, and they have in fact helped articulate their procedures and protocols for Americans returning into this country.
[00:29:09.829 --> 00:29:11.430]  And we are grateful for that.
[00:29:12.591 --> 00:29:18.015]  While our Liberians... You know, I don't think he's even so much bashing grudge as the media spun it that way.
[00:29:18.885 --> 00:29:24.626]  But the issue is, drive a lot of panic, and then they go on to admit, but it is spreading, it is getting worse.
[00:29:25.247 --> 00:29:30.108]  Ebola, International Health Emergency, World Health Organization, are they driving panic?
[00:29:30.528 --> 00:29:37.290]  The UN Health Agency is calling for global response to the West Africa epidemic to stop and reverse the spread of the disease.
[00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:41.931]  What they really don't like is that InfoWars.com, DrugsReport.com and others
[00:29:42.891 --> 00:29:43.952]  Know what's going on.
[00:29:44.352 --> 00:29:45.593]  We break the stuff first.
[00:29:46.233 --> 00:29:48.255]  And then it doesn't allow them to control the narrative.
[00:29:48.635 --> 00:29:50.757]  That's what they're really upset about.
[00:29:50.877 --> 00:29:52.178]  Not that we're causing panic.
[00:29:52.578 --> 00:29:56.561]  We're trying to cause a response to stop a crisis getting worse.
[00:29:56.901 --> 00:29:57.761]  We're on the march.
[00:29:57.781 --> 00:29:59.102]  We want stability.
[00:29:59.443 --> 00:30:00.303]  We want a future.
[00:30:01.464 --> 00:30:03.605]  We want our freedom back!
[00:30:04.426 --> 00:30:05.507]  We don't like Big Brother!
[00:30:08.417 --> 00:30:14.360]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:18.762]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[00:30:19.143 --> 00:30:23.705]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[00:30:24.125 --> 00:30:26.726]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[00:30:27.046 --> 00:30:32.228]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[00:30:32.489 --> 00:30:39.371]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[00:30:39.872 --> 00:30:43.633]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[00:30:44.013 --> 00:30:48.795]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:49.116 --> 00:30:49.976]  This is innovating.
[00:30:50.256 --> 00:30:57.542]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[00:30:57.742 --> 00:31:01.805]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.

[00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:09.832]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:31:10.152 --> 00:31:18.099]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:31:18.199 --> 00:31:25.526]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:31:25.766 --> 00:31:30.050]  I just received my Male Vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:40.514]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:31:40.995 --> 00:31:47.157]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:31:47.477 --> 00:31:49.698]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:31:49.718 --> 00:31:53.700]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and getting the day started.
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:55.463]  It's not just the Supermail Vitality.

[00:32:08.473 --> 00:32:10.274]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[00:32:10.795 --> 00:32:17.759]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[00:32:18.219 --> 00:32:28.606]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[00:32:29.047 --> 00:32:38.293]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[00:32:38.993 --> 00:32:42.414]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[00:32:43.074 --> 00:32:46.495]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[00:32:46.815 --> 00:32:48.416]  Experience the new formula.
[00:32:48.876 --> 00:32:50.877]  Experience the ancient purity.
[00:32:51.457 --> 00:32:52.477]  Shield your family.

[00:33:15.345 --> 00:33:22.135]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:46.334 --> 00:33:48.176]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:48.196 --> 00:33:48.796]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:48.856 --> 00:33:49.317]  Central.
[00:33:49.857 --> 00:33:50.698]  We're here live.
[00:33:50.718 --> 00:33:52.760]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:59.447]  My cousin, Buckley Hammond, who grew up the first five, six, seven years, I don't know, of his life in Guatemala.
[00:34:00.905 --> 00:34:03.506]  It's just going to give you a little perspective of what it was like then.
[00:34:04.006 --> 00:34:05.787]  Now it's rated even worse.
[00:34:06.287 --> 00:34:11.029]  And that's where the majority of this new wave of, uh, 17% of them are children.
[00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:14.471]  But if it's a 50-year-old serial killer, you're not allowed to stop them.
[00:34:15.071 --> 00:34:22.394]  Even if they've been deported six times, you gotta let them come back and murder a Border Patrol agent and his father, who are fishing right in front of their mother.
[00:34:23.575 --> 00:34:24.495]  Just to take their wallet.
[00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:26.340]  That's the funny thing.
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:31.622]  These folks coming out of Mexico and Latin America, they mainly prey on other Hispanics.
[00:34:32.022 --> 00:34:37.464]  But if you don't want Hispanic Americans being murdered en masse, or being fed on by drug gangs, you're racist.
[00:34:38.764 --> 00:34:46.226]  So we're going to talk to Buckley Hammond, my cousin, who helped start InfoWars 19 years ago, who now has come back to the team last year.
[00:34:46.626 --> 00:34:47.287]  He's here with us.
[00:34:47.327 --> 00:34:48.467]  That's coming up in a few minutes.
[00:34:48.787 --> 00:34:49.867]  But here's the headline.
[00:34:50.267 --> 00:34:51.588]  Border Patrol Agent.
[00:34:51.648 --> 00:34:54.549]  These people are coming here to do horrible things.
[00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:55.049]  Here's the club.
[00:34:55.669 --> 00:35:09.424]  So if we can't go out and do our job, and we're going to practice this policy of catch and release, where Border Patrol catch people, these are not people that are just coming here to work as the so-called line is fed to us.
[00:35:09.844 --> 00:35:10.625]  These people are coming...
[00:35:11.152 --> 00:35:16.815]  To do horrible things and I think the murder of Agent Vega shows what these people are capable of.
[00:35:17.956 --> 00:35:25.420]  And so we have this situation where we catch them and then when they're turned over to ICE they are being ordered to be released.
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:34.185]  And how is that an effective border strategy and how any politician, the president included, can justify that is beyond me.
[00:35:36.434 --> 00:35:39.376]  And again, our clip system has been jittering a bit lately.
[00:35:39.396 --> 00:35:42.038]  We're going to get to the bottom of that, because we're not editing these clips.
[00:35:42.058 --> 00:35:43.139]  They're just jumping around.
[00:35:43.179 --> 00:35:48.102]  But you got the basics of what he was saying there.
[00:35:48.323 --> 00:35:51.685]  You know, it's not our in-house video produced clips and news that are jittering.
[00:35:52.105 --> 00:35:53.366]  I think it's the way we're downloading them.
[00:35:53.526 --> 00:35:54.827]  I think you're going to find the issue there.
[00:35:55.768 --> 00:35:59.731]  Continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, with the Infowars.com News.
[00:36:01.124 --> 00:36:07.451]  Mainstream media, though, is saying Americans against wide-open borders are anti-immigration.
[00:36:07.951 --> 00:36:12.096]  But no other civilized country has opened its borders as widely as America has.
[00:36:12.156 --> 00:36:14.098]  Kit Daniels breaks it down.
[00:36:14.538 --> 00:36:22.446]  What KVEO-TV is reporting that anyone, including ranchers that are being robbed on a weekly basis,
[00:36:23.654 --> 00:36:28.279]  Who doesn't want to have open borders is basically a racist.
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:30.482]  So this is the mindlessness of it.
[00:36:30.882 --> 00:36:40.132]  And then you've got the dumbed-down propaganda of people like the Vice President a few days ago saying these are all our children.
[00:36:41.926 --> 00:36:50.048]  Meanwhile, they made a deal a year ago in Guatemala to bring these people in and to allow Guatemala to allow people from Central and South America to come through.
[00:36:50.508 --> 00:37:05.832]  And Mexico has a deal now, on record, an international racketeering, smuggling, drug trafficking, money laundering deal with the Obama administration to let their people through and turn the border patrol into a conveyor belt.
[00:37:07.708 --> 00:37:11.930]  To deliver the illegals and to bust them anywhere they want to go in the country.
[00:37:13.371 --> 00:37:17.473]  17% is the latest numbers in the new Border Patrol report that leaked last week.
[00:37:18.613 --> 00:37:21.835]  Pointing out that thousands are from Ebola-stricken countries.
[00:37:22.675 --> 00:37:26.557]  Thousands more from Al-Qaeda and IS-linked countries.
[00:37:28.092 --> 00:37:31.035]  And again, I'm not wringing my hands in fear of the Ebola.
[00:37:31.656 --> 00:37:32.877]  It just shows the recklessness.
[00:37:33.337 --> 00:37:35.480]  I'm not wringing my hands in fear of the Al-Qaeda people.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:39.584]  Even if they were to blow up a bunch of stuff, okay, kills a few thousand people, I'm sad that happens.
[00:37:39.844 --> 00:37:46.430]  Statistically, cars, cancer, heart attacks, electrocution, drowning, drowned, it's all much more dangerous.
[00:37:47.011 --> 00:37:48.431]  It's like I'm not scared of great white sharks.
[00:37:48.451 --> 00:37:52.453]  It'd be a terrible way to get killed, but I mean five people a year on average get killed by it.
[00:37:52.913 --> 00:38:00.075]  The point is it shows the whole war on terror is a facade and an excuse to bring in a police state that takes all of our rights.
[00:38:01.355 --> 00:38:08.417]  So let's go to that clip because I mentioned Biden again yesterday saying this and saw a comment on YouTube saying I was a liar.
[00:38:08.777 --> 00:38:09.558]  He hadn't said this.
[00:38:09.598 --> 00:38:10.538]  So here's the clip.
[00:38:10.978 --> 00:38:12.358]  These are not somebody else's kids.
[00:38:13.579 --> 00:38:14.139]  These are our kids.
[00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:21.373]  These are the children that lift the national ambitions of each of these countries aloft.
[00:38:24.575 --> 00:38:27.817]  And, um, it's a tragedy.
[00:38:28.817 --> 00:38:36.582]  For the countries who are losing them, and for us not being able to solve every one of their problems.
[00:38:38.369 --> 00:38:40.851]  Oh, you can't abort all of them.
[00:38:40.871 --> 00:38:54.840]  And now all the conservatives and Christians and Christian conservative libertarians and constitutionalists that are against aborting nine-month-old babies that could just be delivered and instantly adopted up.
[00:38:56.281 --> 00:38:58.543]  And the mother could be paid $50,000 to $200,000 by the adoption agency for the healthy baby.
[00:39:02.642 --> 00:39:04.462]  Blond-haired, blue-eyed babies, $400,000.
[00:39:05.363 --> 00:39:07.203]  Black-haired, green-eyed babies, $500,000, $600,000.
[00:39:07.483 --> 00:39:09.603]  Hispanic babies, $150,000.
[00:39:11.104 --> 00:39:12.444]  Black babies, $50,000.
[00:39:13.784 --> 00:39:15.064]  I'm sad, that's just the market.
[00:39:15.084 --> 00:39:16.425]  I think all the babies are worth the same.
[00:39:18.345 --> 00:39:23.846]  It's come out the CPS has quotas on kids that the adoption agencies want and they end up getting money for it.
[00:39:23.866 --> 00:39:25.346]  It's a huge criminal racket.
[00:39:25.726 --> 00:39:28.007]  Most of the CPS are actually private guilds and groups.
[00:39:29.224 --> 00:39:35.366]  There are some people that work in the foster system that aren't even bad, but at the top, it's big spiders running the operation.
[00:39:36.347 --> 00:39:41.829]  And no one's going to cry out for those kids, or the kids having radiation tested on them, or pesticides tested on them.
[00:39:41.849 --> 00:39:43.310]  That even comes out in New York Daily News.
[00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:44.570]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:47.091]  Killing little black kids with pesticides.
[00:39:47.571 --> 00:39:56.895]  No one tells the women that if they call the phone number on those billboards that Catholic charities and others put up that say, you know, pregnant, scared,
[00:39:58.291 --> 00:40:02.715]  That you'll end up getting everything paid for to have your baby and money at the end of it.
[00:40:06.418 --> 00:40:11.462]  That you just go in, you get an abortion that doubles your chances of different types of uterine cancer.
[00:40:12.944 --> 00:40:13.944]  All sorts of other issues.
[00:40:13.984 --> 00:40:14.645]  No one tells you that.
[00:40:15.005 --> 00:40:18.468]  And oh, it's because Joe Biden loves the children.
[00:40:22.272 --> 00:40:24.073]  Don't we have a video of the birth of Joe Biden?
[00:40:24.113 --> 00:40:24.914]  Can you guys queue that up?
[00:40:27.251 --> 00:40:28.412]  John Bowne knows where it's at.
[00:40:28.512 --> 00:40:32.274]  It's the birth of Obama, I think, caught on tape is the name of it.
[00:40:33.615 --> 00:40:38.837]  And it's satire, but... Let me cue that up, we can play it.
[00:40:39.098 --> 00:40:46.962]  The point is, they could care less about these kids, and they have no moral high ground, when plus 17% of the illegals pouring in are the kids.
[00:40:48.382 --> 00:40:51.184]  We're gonna talk about what the border's like here in a moment with Buckley Hammond.
[00:40:51.564 --> 00:40:54.246]  First off, you've already started to hear rave reviews.
[00:40:55.382 --> 00:40:56.363]  About DNA Force.
[00:40:56.823 --> 00:40:58.484]  We won't get more of it for 10 weeks.
[00:40:59.184 --> 00:41:00.345]  We're going as fast as we can.
[00:41:00.365 --> 00:41:14.894]  This is our proprietary blend of the true, organic, made in America, not synthetic, patented, known things like PPQ and CoQ10 and a bunch of other stuff, where one ingredient in the bottle costs us $40.
[00:41:15.995 --> 00:41:16.555]  That's why it's $130.
[00:41:18.578 --> 00:41:24.441]  Formulas that aren't even as good, high-powered, nutramedical type stuff is $600 to $1,000.
[00:41:24.721 --> 00:41:27.462]  So that gives you an idea of why it's sold out in one day.
[00:41:27.482 --> 00:41:30.584]  We're going to get a lot more of it next time if we're able to.
[00:41:30.624 --> 00:41:35.546]  We're working on that right now because this stuff is basically pharmaceutical grade.
[00:41:35.566 --> 00:41:38.487]  That's why they call it nutraceutical.
[00:41:39.568 --> 00:41:40.588]  I've been on it a few months.
[00:41:40.628 --> 00:41:41.649]  Incredible response.
[00:41:42.189 --> 00:41:43.289]  Other people in the office are on it.
[00:41:43.309 --> 00:41:45.670]  They're coming up going, man, that stuff's even more amazing.
[00:41:45.991 --> 00:41:46.591]  We don't have it.
[00:41:47.557 --> 00:41:58.620]  We don't have this little gem either yet for a few months, because we're busy getting the patent pending and trademarking it and stuff, but this is something entirely new that no one else has that I've been taking.
[00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:04.202]  And people said my eyes look clearer, you name it, because I lead a very stressful life.
[00:42:04.522 --> 00:42:14.285]  Sorry, both these things are unavailable at InfoWarsLife.com, but what is available is Survival Shield Super Nascent Iodine, the only source sold anywhere from deep beneath the earth.
[00:42:15.612 --> 00:42:22.157]  Between 7 and 12,000 feet, pure purple crystals that are then aerosolized.
[00:42:22.177 --> 00:42:35.146]  I forget the term of it when you take a solid and turn it into a gas like this where it actually... It's an interesting term my dad was talking about this morning and we have video of it on a hot plate there if you're a TV viewer.
[00:42:36.026 --> 00:42:37.247]  The crystals that we have
[00:42:38.769 --> 00:42:39.450]  I don't know.
[00:43:03.581 --> 00:43:06.282]  Leading competitors are double the price, half the strength.
[00:43:06.762 --> 00:43:09.762]  That was with the old iodine survival shield that I think is better for kids.
[00:43:10.042 --> 00:43:11.542]  Consult your physician because it's not as strong.
[00:43:13.083 --> 00:43:15.083]  This stuff is just, there's nothing like it.
[00:43:16.123 --> 00:43:16.603]  X2.
[00:43:18.264 --> 00:43:22.404]  And it helps fund info wars and our operation.
[00:43:22.905 --> 00:43:24.405]  And I take it morning, noon, and night.
[00:43:24.805 --> 00:43:29.046]  Now, I did go through the detoxing the first two, three weeks when I took it.
[00:43:29.386 --> 00:43:30.286]  I was warned about that.
[00:43:31.052 --> 00:43:33.475]  But then after that, it's just like clarity.
[00:43:34.015 --> 00:43:34.556]  It's amazing.
[00:43:35.437 --> 00:43:36.478]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:43:36.778 --> 00:43:42.244]  From my perspective, what I had happen with myself, friends and family, you've heard the rave reviews.
[00:43:42.564 --> 00:43:52.675]  Bottom line, try X2, try Survival Shield, try Fluoride Shield, try Lung Cleanse with all the key essential oils concentrated, organic, three shots in the mouth.
[00:43:54.397 --> 00:43:55.818]  Then you inhale, just get a little bit in the lungs.
[00:43:56.919 --> 00:44:00.062]  Amazing what it does when I have a sore throat or my larynx is worn out.
[00:44:00.642 --> 00:44:01.583]  We still have some of that.
[00:44:02.123 --> 00:44:05.386]  The colloidal silver, silver bullet is almost sold out.
[00:44:05.686 --> 00:44:07.247]  It'll probably be a month till we get more of it in.
[00:44:07.547 --> 00:44:11.811]  Proprietary, powerful, nano silver, $19.95.
[00:44:12.551 --> 00:44:21.098]  It's just relabeled from one of the biggest high quality manufacturers out there and a large food company, organic food operation.
[00:44:22.399 --> 00:44:25.802]  Sells the same thing for $29.95, just to give you an example of what we do.
[00:44:26.122 --> 00:44:28.044]  The highest quality, slash the prices.
[00:44:28.444 --> 00:44:32.467]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:44:33.048 --> 00:44:35.390]  And guys, I don't have much water left in here.
[00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:39.073]  Do me a favor, give me some water so I can... Oh, my cousin's got over.
[00:44:39.993 --> 00:44:41.514]  He's got some water here so I can mix this up.
[00:44:41.534 --> 00:44:41.975]  Thank you, bro.
[00:44:42.595 --> 00:44:44.737]  And I'm gonna take my noontime dose.
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:49.221]  Ah, delicious.
[00:44:50.279 --> 00:44:51.879]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:44:52.339 --> 00:44:53.180]  Take the challenge.
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:54.420]  888-253-3139.
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:45:03.882]  Now, my cousin grew up in Guatemala.
[00:45:03.982 --> 00:45:05.282]  I'll have him tell you the story.
[00:45:06.362 --> 00:45:09.023]  And just hit some of the high points or low points.
[00:45:09.383 --> 00:45:10.143]  Beautiful country.
[00:45:10.203 --> 00:45:11.684]  Got to see volcanoes erupting.
[00:45:12.224 --> 00:45:13.044]  Interesting people.
[00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:16.554]  Just south of Mexico.
[00:45:17.195 --> 00:45:21.284]  Used to be part of Mexico, but Santa Ana made them mad, so they broke away like Texas did.
[00:45:21.324 --> 00:45:24.271]  He was such a thug, increasing taxes, trying to take their guns.
[00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:33.053]  He grew up there because my aunt and uncle were down there working on, I guess they bought property on a coffee plantation.
[00:45:33.693 --> 00:45:36.954]  But the issue was a lot of his Vietnam buddies were moving down there, so he moved down there.
[00:45:37.955 --> 00:45:41.136]  And he can tell you the rest of the story of what Guatemala's like.
[00:45:41.176 --> 00:45:46.578]  And by the way, he was there in the 70s and early 80s when it was bad.
[00:45:46.758 --> 00:45:49.099]  It is now, by every metric, much worse
[00:45:50.222 --> 00:45:51.202]  An absolute hell hole.
[00:45:51.923 --> 00:45:54.204]  Beautiful place, but a green hell.
[00:45:54.684 --> 00:46:01.447]  And Buckley Hammond, one of the original Infowarriors, now back on the team after a decade in Chicago, up there working for big TV.
[00:46:02.087 --> 00:46:08.230]  Buckley, tell folks, just I have no idea even what you're going to break down, I know some of the stories, your brother kidnapped, all of it.
[00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:12.192]  Go through those stories for people so they understand what's coming up here.
[00:46:12.652 --> 00:46:14.513]  And that Joe Biden says there are children.
[00:46:14.773 --> 00:46:16.054]  It's our responsibility.
[00:46:16.334 --> 00:46:17.354]  Can't take care of your kids?
[00:46:17.374 --> 00:46:18.155]  You're going bankrupt?
[00:46:18.775 --> 00:46:20.578]  Have trouble getting off work to pick your kids up at school?
[00:46:21.059 --> 00:46:21.580]  Doesn't matter.
[00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:22.501]  These are your kids.
[00:46:22.541 --> 00:46:25.506]  The whole world's your responsibility or you're racist.
[00:46:26.553 --> 00:46:27.494]  So, Buckley Hammond.
[00:46:27.994 --> 00:46:28.475]  Exactly.
[00:46:28.975 --> 00:46:32.499]  First of all, let me just say that the whole magnitude of this experience isn't lost on me.
[00:46:33.079 --> 00:46:45.470]  I'm really, really happy to be here talking to you and talking to your more than three million daily listeners that, to me, represent the core of a new renaissance, of a new field of thought in the world that we're spreading liberty.
[00:46:45.651 --> 00:46:48.373]  And I'm really excited to be here, so let me just get that out of the way.
[00:46:49.554 --> 00:46:54.356]  Regarding Guatemala, you know, it's a really long and interesting subject.
[00:46:54.376 --> 00:46:59.558]  You could pore over books and read Wikipedia articles, etc.
[00:46:59.598 --> 00:47:04.980]  about it all day long, and it's just been a century of conflict down there.
[00:47:06.461 --> 00:47:13.649]  And when you're talking about the violence that is occurring there down there now, unfortunately, that's not a new phenomenon.
[00:47:13.669 --> 00:47:22.679]  And there's a duality to this that I think is really important to understand is that, yes, it has always been very violent down there, but the nature of the violence has changed.
[00:47:24.401 --> 00:47:30.646]  If you go all the way back into the history of Guatemala, obviously it was colonized by the Spaniards, and the Spaniards were there for a long time.
[00:47:30.746 --> 00:47:34.028]  They brought a lot of really positive, interesting things to the culture.
[00:47:34.088 --> 00:47:36.890]  Their architecture is still there, and it's really gorgeous and beautiful.
[00:47:37.571 --> 00:47:46.898]  But, you know, all the Indians were basically their indentured servants, and you had everything that is endemic to most of the colonial experiences around the world.
[00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:56.605]  In the 1950s, and this is a story that every conspiracy theorist should know because it's not a theory, it's an actual fact.
[00:47:56.685 --> 00:47:57.026]  C.I.
[00:47:57.086 --> 00:47:57.346]  Coon.
[00:47:57.546 --> 00:47:57.986]  Exactly.
[00:47:58.026 --> 00:48:04.532]  In the 1950s, United Fruit, with the help of the CIA, deposed a president named Jacobo Arbenz.
[00:48:05.212 --> 00:48:10.997]  And they basically just went in there, just exactly like the globalists are doing now, but it was a lot more brazen because they just came in
[00:48:11.577 --> 00:48:23.480]  With their guns and they just took control of the whole situation so that people like Bob Dole of, you know, Chiquita Banana, which is now Unite, which was United Fruit, could get their way.
[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:27.480]  You know, they just marched in there with guns and just made whatever they needed to happen, happen.
[00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:39.923]  And so, I would highly suggest that people go and read about that because that's a really, really interesting and really just open, naked view into the nascent globalists' sort of power structure.
[00:48:40.143 --> 00:48:42.205]  And it's easy to say, oh, that's third world people, let them do it.
[00:48:42.685 --> 00:48:43.566]  Now they're doing it to us.
[00:48:44.026 --> 00:48:44.526]  Absolutely.
[00:48:44.547 --> 00:48:45.467]  They're turning it around.
[00:48:45.487 --> 00:48:57.076]  And you know, the sad thing is that after that happened, in the 1950s and from 1960s, there has been a civil war in Guatemala from the 1960s all the way through to 1996.
[00:48:57.156 --> 00:48:57.716]  Now that is 36 years.
[00:49:00.138 --> 00:49:05.201]  36 years that the country has been racked, you know, with a violent, violent civil war.
[00:49:05.561 --> 00:49:24.050]  And the majority of that is basically just this revolving door of people in power and leftist and socialist and actually communist like Russian supported insurgents, you know, that were attacking a government that was backed by the CIA in the United States.
[00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:25.931]  And it just went back and forth and back and forth.
[00:49:25.951 --> 00:49:28.032]  So the country is just riddled with
[00:49:29.173 --> 00:49:36.261]  with uh... you know bloodletting that's been going on for generations now what is significant about that is the fact that
[00:49:37.895 --> 00:49:41.637]  That now, you know, now the Civil War is supposedly over, right?
[00:49:41.937 --> 00:49:49.160]  But what has happened is you've had generations and generations of people who have known nothing but violence and have been racked back and forth by violence.
[00:49:50.161 --> 00:49:58.805]  And basically all the power structures that are there, like the police and any sort of way to keep civil calm, has been almost completely deconstructed.
[00:49:59.165 --> 00:50:00.686]  So at this stage right now,
[00:50:01.266 --> 00:50:14.755]  Guatemala is, instead of having two forces that are sort of fighting each other, it's become an absolute cesspool of horrific, absolute horrific violence against the people themselves.
[00:50:15.035 --> 00:50:16.496]  It's anarchy.
[00:50:16.536 --> 00:50:18.958]  What all these anarchists want is Guatemala.
[00:50:18.978 --> 00:50:24.442]  This is what government devolves into, an absolute nightmare instead of a very small constitutional government.
[00:50:24.822 --> 00:50:25.322]  Exactly.
[00:50:25.583 --> 00:50:30.426]  And there's an article that I read a long time ago and I went back and I looked it up again and it was just
[00:50:30.486 --> 00:50:30.686]  I don't
[00:50:46.658 --> 00:50:52.199]  Guatemalan bus drivers were killed by thugs and gangsters and murderers over the course of a year.
[00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:54.660]  So I would highly suggest people go and read that.
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:55.400]  I think it's... 900!
[00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:57.081]  And again, that's what's coming here.
[00:50:57.101 --> 00:50:58.401]  Because it's not just Guatemala.
[00:50:58.921 --> 00:51:04.703]  All of Central and South America is descending into road warrior, frothing insanity.
[00:51:04.943 --> 00:51:06.083]  And our government is saying...
[00:51:06.443 --> 00:51:07.585]  Come on, come up here!
[00:51:07.725 --> 00:51:10.609]  This hour brought to you by InfidelBodyArmor.com.

[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.562]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:09.822 --> 00:52:14.685]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:14.945 --> 00:52:22.830]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:23.071 --> 00:52:27.373]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:27.593 --> 00:52:31.416]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:31.556 --> 00:52:37.257]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:37.497 --> 00:52:40.278]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:40.658 --> 00:52:45.899]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:52:46.039 --> 00:52:54.161]  Go to MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[00:52:54.501 --> 00:52:55.021]  Do business
[00:53:06.785 --> 00:53:11.567]  It seems that everywhere you turn to these days, people are talking about the health benefits of silver.
[00:53:11.907 --> 00:53:14.589]  But don't be fooled into believing all silver is the same.
[00:53:15.049 --> 00:53:20.872]  Only one silver solution has been clinically shown to be hundreds of times stronger than colloidal or ionic silver.
[00:53:21.172 --> 00:53:22.954]  That's Supernatural Silver.
[00:53:23.375 --> 00:53:28.140]  It can be used internally as a powerful immune system enhancer to fight off bacteria and viruses.
[00:53:28.461 --> 00:53:32.846]  Supernatural Silver can be used topically to treat any type of wound or skin issue.
[00:53:33.286 --> 00:53:36.530]  It's even gentle enough to be used on the ears, eyes, and sinuses.
[00:53:36.871 --> 00:53:41.316]  And unlike harsh drugs and antibiotics, Supernatural Silver has no side effects.

[00:54:16.912 --> 00:54:20.594]  The globalists have deliberately destabilized Central and South America.
[00:54:21.334 --> 00:54:23.415]  They're now moving to destabilize North America.
[00:54:23.435 --> 00:54:29.058]  They started with Mexico, and this is part of their larger plan, so anyone who's for...
[00:54:29.878 --> 00:54:32.319]  All these illegals pouring in wants to destroy the country.
[00:54:32.599 --> 00:54:32.879]  Period.
[00:54:32.899 --> 00:54:34.319]  You can say, oh, it's for children all day.
[00:54:34.659 --> 00:54:34.919]  Bull.
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:41.461]  Buckley, get back into the 900 bus drivers killed in one year to the point of buses just stop moving.
[00:54:42.081 --> 00:54:46.923]  This is the insanity of an unstable country where people only know how to rob and steal.
[00:54:47.503 --> 00:54:59.149]  When the country goes completely bad and now the crime rate is exploding across the Southwest as the crime wave out of Central and South America conduits up through Mexico in a deliberate plan.
[00:54:59.209 --> 00:55:00.389]  Buckley, break down the stories.
[00:55:00.690 --> 00:55:01.370]  Well, you're right.
[00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:08.233]  You know, when when violence gets to that level, it just creates a it's like your body like locking down in toxic shock.
[00:55:08.353 --> 00:55:09.014]  You know, it just
[00:55:09.674 --> 00:55:10.394]  Nothing can work.
[00:55:10.474 --> 00:55:19.157]  I mean, how can bus drivers and people who drive trucks with products in the back make it from point A to point B, you know, without being robbed at gunpoint?
[00:55:19.357 --> 00:55:22.278]  And so it's a really, really vicious circumstance.
[00:55:22.338 --> 00:55:28.019]  And one of the things that I'd like to do is just sort of relate a couple of stories that happened to me personally when I was growing up in Guatemala.
[00:55:28.439 --> 00:55:35.862]  I was born in 1974 in Guatemala City in the Aurora Hospital down there.
[00:55:37.762 --> 00:55:41.703]  I live there for, until I was about 11 years old, we came back in 1986.
[00:55:41.743 --> 00:55:51.407]  And the first story that I'm going to tell is about some friends of my parents, and this was before I was even one year old.
[00:55:51.927 --> 00:55:57.589]  The woman's name was Elsa Schumann, and the little boy, his name was Jonas, and he was my friend.
[00:55:57.629 --> 00:55:59.789]  You know, I like little pre-toddler babies.
[00:55:59.869 --> 00:56:01.810]  Let me be clear, your dad was down there as a missionary.
[00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:03.291]  Ran a Christian school, too.
[00:56:03.471 --> 00:56:03.971]  Exactly.
[00:56:04.611 --> 00:56:14.137]  And so one day they went downtown, the wife and the young boy went downtown to go to the market and a bomb exploded nearby them.
[00:56:14.777 --> 00:56:17.279]  And they were both severely injured.
[00:56:17.579 --> 00:56:18.820]  The little boy, Jonas, died.
[00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:24.823]  And the mother gave my mom a teddy bear that I have kept with me my whole life.
[00:56:24.883 --> 00:56:25.604]  It's been in my bed.
[00:56:26.144 --> 00:56:40.491]  for my whole life and that's to be a sort of a reminder of where I came from and uh... it's uh... it's uh... it's a really stark reminder that uh... you know children and and everybody else uh... is is a danger and as collateral collateral damage in this war
[00:56:41.631 --> 00:56:43.412]  Was that a loving communist bomb that killed him?
[00:56:43.733 --> 00:56:44.233]  Absolutely.
[00:56:44.273 --> 00:56:45.634]  It was a loving communist bomb.
[00:56:47.075 --> 00:56:53.620]  So another story was that my mom and I were downtown at one point, going to the, actually it was the bank if I remember correctly.
[00:56:53.660 --> 00:57:00.644]  We were in the bank and a bomb blew up, a car bomb blew up outside the, you know, all the plaster was coming off the walls, etc.
[00:57:00.684 --> 00:57:01.845]  I remember that very clearly.
[00:57:01.905 --> 00:57:04.627]  So I very nearly was in one of those circumstances too.
[00:57:05.708 --> 00:57:06.429]  I don't know.
[00:57:20.937 --> 00:57:24.840]  You know, like when you come off the exit and you have to turn around a circular way to go down.
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:27.542]  And there was a big shootout in front of us.
[00:57:27.622 --> 00:57:28.703]  It was an assassination.
[00:57:28.723 --> 00:57:31.404]  A bunch of people just shot the car in front of us.
[00:57:31.945 --> 00:57:36.708]  And our driver drove off the road, went off-roading and drove off, and we just saw the aftermath of that.
[00:57:38.209 --> 00:57:44.773]  I remember my mom reminded me this today, this morning, that when we were driving around, she used to play a game where she would say, duck!
[00:57:45.214 --> 00:57:46.935]  And we would all have to duck, you know?
[00:57:46.955 --> 00:57:53.319]  And it was really just preparing us for the next time that there was, you know, a fusillade of bullets and guns.
[00:57:53.699 --> 00:57:56.221]  And of course, guns were banned there, but it was a total hellhole.
[00:57:56.481 --> 00:57:57.282]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:57:57.682 --> 00:57:58.943]  Just like Mexico.
[00:57:59.763 --> 00:58:07.429]  And once a civil war, a mafia war breaks out, once we accept a gangster culture, you don't hardly ever come back.
[00:58:08.129 --> 00:58:13.833]  You can knock Christians all day, and America hasn't been perfect, but we've been a lot more stable than other nations.
[00:58:14.174 --> 00:58:21.339]  That's what made the wealth, and now we're converting to a gangster culture, and our government wants it to happen.
[00:58:21.359 --> 00:58:30.166]  I want to hear more of these stories when we come back, Buckley Hammond, in the next hour, but first off, in the 30 seconds we've got left, why do you think the system wants to do this here?
[00:58:31.328 --> 00:58:33.389]  Well, I think they're gonna want to implode it from the inside.
[00:58:33.409 --> 00:58:34.970]  I mean, it's like injecting a cancer.
[00:58:35.010 --> 00:58:37.912]  It's like putting polonium inside of somebody's body, you know?
[00:58:37.952 --> 00:58:45.397]  It's, uh... If you take people that have lived in that circumstance and you put them inside of a normal society, we're soft, aren't we?
[00:58:45.417 --> 00:58:45.778]  Stay there.
[00:58:46.498 --> 00:58:47.879]  See, I want to hear about this when we come back.
[00:58:47.899 --> 00:58:48.840]  That's powerful.
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:50.761]  But again, that's racist.
[00:58:51.241 --> 00:58:53.583]  When he was in the bombs and the baby died.
[00:58:53.603 --> 00:58:55.524]  And he doesn't love it.
[00:58:55.564 --> 00:58:56.525]  He should want to.
[00:58:57.452 --> 00:58:59.854]  This is Scottish John for InfoWars.com.
[00:58:59.954 --> 00:59:06.478]  I know that most of you here in this commercial already know about the New World Order, eugenics, and all the other issues covered here at InfoWars.
[00:59:06.638 --> 00:59:09.240]  The question is, do your friends and family know?
[00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:11.181]  If not, then I want to know why.
[00:59:11.361 --> 00:59:13.603]  Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with some people.
[00:59:13.683 --> 00:59:17.886]  They might call you names, or they just want to talk about sports, or soap operas.
[00:59:18.146 --> 00:59:19.167]  I say, so what?
[00:59:19.307 --> 00:59:21.309]  There's a battle going on out there right now.
[00:59:21.529 --> 00:59:24.631]  The ammunition is information, and the soldiers are you.
[00:59:24.891 --> 00:59:29.014]  It's time to transform your game from passive listener to active participant.
[00:59:29.155 --> 00:59:34.859]  We from Scotland have had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand years, and I'm still fighting.
[00:59:34.999 --> 00:59:38.021]  If we don't all stand up right now, we're gonna lose everything.
[00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:39.923]  The Info War is worldwide.
[00:59:40.043 --> 00:59:44.166]  Tell your friends about Info Wars, and let them know that Info Wars doesn't print bull.

[01:00:18.319 --> 01:00:19.140]  You want answers?
[01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:20.821]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:21.462 --> 01:00:25.084]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:25.644 --> 01:00:29.747]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.088 --> 01:00:36.492]  Guys, when we come back in the next segment, I'm going to finish up with Buckley and then we're going to get into what I haven't covered yet in detail.
[01:00:37.012 --> 01:00:38.834]  Hundreds reported killed after U.S.
[01:00:38.894 --> 01:00:41.896]  bombs IS-IS position in Iraq.
[01:00:43.493 --> 01:00:50.697]  They were poised to take the air bull in the autonomous region of Kurdistan.
[01:00:50.717 --> 01:00:52.599]  I'm going to explain what's really going on here.
[01:00:53.239 --> 01:00:57.662]  Guys, print me the Airlift of Evil MSNBC BBC articles from 2001.
[01:00:57.782 --> 01:00:59.943]  I want to just show people that there.
[01:01:00.383 --> 01:01:02.364]  This is totally staged, totally fake.
[01:01:02.384 --> 01:01:03.865]  We're going to break that down.
[01:01:04.386 --> 01:01:09.289]  Buckley, continuing, and you're going to tell us more of the stories in the next segment.
[01:01:10.123 --> 01:01:12.228]  And then finish up with your big picture.
[01:01:12.248 --> 01:01:15.116]  You want to get into the whole refugee situation and decipher that.
[01:01:15.176 --> 01:01:18.985]  But some of the other stories of what you saw in Guatemala.
[01:01:19.963 --> 01:01:38.874]  Well, you know, there was, beyond what I experienced personally, and I can only tell those stories from my perspective, I know that there was a lot of fear in Guatemala regarding recriminations and different people who would attack other people, and then just straight up... People would tattle, though, to send the government at you?
[01:01:38.894 --> 01:01:40.435]  Those stories?
[01:01:40.836 --> 01:01:41.276]  Absolutely.
[01:01:41.296 --> 01:01:44.298]  They tried to claim your ham radio stuff was terrorist or something?
[01:01:44.824 --> 01:01:48.267]  Yeah, my dad had been a ham radio since he was young.
[01:01:48.307 --> 01:01:49.748]  He was the youngest guy in Texas ever.
[01:01:49.788 --> 01:01:50.709]  I think in the country, actually.
[01:01:50.729 --> 01:01:51.169]  Exactly.
[01:01:51.189 --> 01:01:53.711]  He was one of the youngest people to ever get a ham radio license.
[01:01:53.771 --> 01:02:03.339]  And obviously he operated a ham radio down there where they would do what's called a phone patch, where someone from up here could call someone with a ham radio and relay it down to him.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.861]  And so people could talk internationally on the phone.
[01:02:05.881 --> 01:02:12.467]  This was before the internet, before international phone lines even went down to third world countries like Guatemala or were reliable.
[01:02:13.187 --> 01:02:14.208]  Uh, but yeah, that's true.
[01:02:14.228 --> 01:02:32.224]  Uh, people would, would say that, that he was working for the CIA or they would say that he was working for the other side and it was just a very convoluted thing and he literally, the government literally came and confiscated all of his equipment and made him shut down his ham radio operation, you know, and he
[01:02:32.244 --> 01:02:33.905]  He was really just an enthusiast.
[01:02:34.305 --> 01:02:44.012]  He would collect CQ cards, which is basically when ham radio people talk to each other, they send each other a card to prove that it happened, and he had it from all over the world.
[01:02:44.232 --> 01:02:50.517]  Africa, the Faroe Islands, Pitcairn Islands, which was a very, that was a really cool one.
[01:02:50.937 --> 01:02:53.058]  So he talked to people all around the world doing that.
[01:02:53.319 --> 01:02:55.280]  Pitcairn, where the bounty went?
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.662]  Exactly, that's the Mutiny on the Bounty place.
[01:02:59.222 --> 01:03:18.691]  So, what that really underscores is that even when you have a society like that, and you have a government that is literally, you know, all-encompassing and militarized to the hilt, that when people don't like you, or they have any sort of personal grudge, or there's a bad circumstance, that, you know, they can make up stories.
[01:03:18.771 --> 01:03:24.174]  They can say that you were doing this and doing that, and it's already starting to happen here in the United States.
[01:03:24.674 --> 01:03:33.698]  You know, there's lots of recriminations that can fly around, especially when there is, you know, they have a government that is really militarized.
[01:03:34.798 --> 01:03:37.520]  And so that was an interesting example.
[01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:38.660]  I didn't even really thought about it.
[01:03:39.318 --> 01:03:42.560]  And once governments get like this, it always makes it explode and get worse.
[01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:44.161]  It doesn't make it get better.
[01:03:44.501 --> 01:03:46.642]  And the war on drugs is fueling it as well.
[01:03:47.242 --> 01:03:47.823]  Absolutely.
[01:03:47.843 --> 01:03:59.829]  Two of the stories I wanted to tell, and they're interesting from two perspectives, is that my brother, who just passed away earlier this year, was actually kidnapped twice in Guatemala when he was a young child.
[01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:07.654]  And the reason why I said it's from two perspectives is because the first time that he was kidnapped, he was kidnapped by criminals who wanted a ransom.
[01:04:08.214 --> 01:04:13.499]  They basically saw a white kid that they could snatch up and they took him away and they demanded a ransom.
[01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:23.329]  And luckily we got him back, you know, and the second time that my brother was kidnapped was for political reasons, oddly enough.
[01:04:24.229 --> 01:04:53.056]  We were familiar with some people that were in the government there in Guatemala and he was kidnapped and basically they were demanding the release of some prisoners that they had for his release and the story goes is that they made the exchange but then they followed the people back to where their safe house was and then they attacked the safe house and when they busted into the safe house they found plans to basically attack the the neighborhood that we lived in
[01:04:53.756 --> 01:04:59.739]  Uh, which was full of, uh, military people and, uh, lots of different, uh, you know, middle to upper class people.
[01:05:00.099 --> 01:05:00.800]  I want to hear about this.
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:03.161]  Tell the whole story when we get back, because this gets wilder and wilder.
[01:05:03.441 --> 01:05:06.483]  The heaven that is Central and South America.
[01:05:07.591 --> 01:05:10.513]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:05:10.633 --> 01:05:12.614]  The latest in preparedness is now here.

[01:05:47.628 --> 01:05:47.948]  We're good.
[01:06:08.135 --> 01:06:15.018]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and sewn American-made jeans.

[01:06:37.642 --> 01:06:41.143]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:06:41.303 --> 01:06:45.265]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:06:45.585 --> 01:06:47.045]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:06:47.365 --> 01:06:54.948]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:06:55.228 --> 01:06:56.068]  But for how long?

[01:07:07.612 --> 01:07:13.556]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:07:13.776 --> 01:07:17.959]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:22.883]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:07:23.303 --> 01:07:25.925]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:07:26.225 --> 01:07:31.409]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:38.555]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[01:07:39.075 --> 01:07:43.138]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[01:07:43.198 --> 01:07:47.982]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:48.322 --> 01:07:49.163]  This is innovating.
[01:07:49.443 --> 01:07:56.748]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.

[01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:27.145]  Coming up in about five minutes, I will break down the latest on Obama supposedly attacking I.S.
[01:08:27.345 --> 01:08:28.046]  or I.S.
[01:08:28.287 --> 01:08:29.428]  I.S., ISIS.
[01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:31.491]  We told you that was coming for a while.
[01:08:31.551 --> 01:08:32.853]  We're going to break it all down.
[01:08:34.495 --> 01:08:37.118]  Coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:08:38.331 --> 01:08:55.847]  But first off, going back to my cousin, Buckley Hammond, who works at Infowars.com, you'll see his name on camera and in production and in graphics and music on my first film, America Destroyed by Design, and the next four films as well.
[01:08:55.867 --> 01:08:58.409]  He's just back at the Infowars base here.
[01:08:59.190 --> 01:09:00.931]  Twenty-two years ago, he would help me
[01:09:02.293 --> 01:09:06.898]  Because he had a recording studio and stuff and was already a successful DJ by the time he was out of high school.
[01:09:07.478 --> 01:09:15.308]  He would help me record commercials to then send to radio stations and say, hey, I want to come there and cut commercials for you.
[01:09:16.001 --> 01:09:18.764]  And they'd laugh at me and stuff, but a few years later they weren't laughing anymore.
[01:09:19.284 --> 01:09:24.189]  And I was there doing mock radio shows, and then I went and started doing accident television, and the rest is history.
[01:09:24.209 --> 01:09:32.979]  But here you are, so the first 11 years of your life growing up in Guatemala, and so your dad's down there as a school administrator.
[01:09:33.619 --> 01:09:35.781]  And he also, you guys bought some property, we're growing coffee.
[01:09:36.082 --> 01:09:40.666]  And a lot of his buddies had moved down there after Vietnam, so there was a lot of government people there as well.
[01:09:42.128 --> 01:09:46.032]  And even, I know, flew some planes for some folks' other jobs, he was a pilot.
[01:09:46.412 --> 01:09:47.954]  And so you're in this government district.
[01:09:49.315 --> 01:09:56.182]  Start back over with these stories of how wondrous Guatemala was then, and then now, what it's devolved into, even worse.
[01:09:57.062 --> 01:10:02.747]  Well, the second story of my brother being kidnapped.
[01:10:02.867 --> 01:10:11.914]  Basically, he was kidnapped by the guerrilleros, which are the insurgent, military insurgent, left-wing military insurgents.
[01:10:11.954 --> 01:10:18.199]  And their plan was that they wanted to have some of their cronies released from prison that had been captured.
[01:10:18.639 --> 01:10:21.103]  So that was what their demands were.
[01:10:21.323 --> 01:10:30.797]  And when they did the exchange with Peter and the prisoners, the intelligence services or something followed the guerrilleros back to where their safe house was.
[01:10:31.197 --> 01:10:33.741]  And then they assaulted the safe house and they came in.
[01:10:34.502 --> 01:10:39.023]  They assaulted the safe house, and when they went in, they saw all these plans laid out on a table.
[01:10:39.063 --> 01:10:41.444]  I mean, it's so ridiculous, it sounds like a movie.
[01:10:41.824 --> 01:10:50.467]  But they busted in, and they found all these plans laid out on the table, where there was an assault and an attack that was just imminently about to happen in the neighborhood that we lived in.
[01:10:50.907 --> 01:10:54.728]  And so basically, they were going to come back around and capture a lot more people.
[01:10:54.788 --> 01:10:56.189]  It was almost like they got too greedy.
[01:10:56.649 --> 01:10:59.190]  And so, they basically
[01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:06.713]  They marshaled a bunch of people and came into our neighborhood and all the military was there and they were hiding behind our walls.
[01:11:06.753 --> 01:11:09.875]  In Guatemala, you have like four to six foot walls around everybody's house.
[01:11:10.595 --> 01:11:21.340]  And the assault happened and literally, while we were inside of our house and we were lying on the ground, so we were staying below the bullets, there was a big assault that happened in my backyard.
[01:11:22.181 --> 01:11:24.962]  The insurgents tried to come in and the military rebuffed them.
[01:11:25.523 --> 01:11:28.024]  And I mean, there were a lot of casualties.
[01:11:28.724 --> 01:11:37.891]  I was young and it was really chaotic and I can't really remember it the way that you would remember a scene from a movie or something like that, but I do remember the whole experience and the circumstance.
[01:11:39.072 --> 01:11:51.622]  So the bottom line is that for a number of different reasons, whether it was criminal or whether it was political, the turmoil in Guatemala is just, it was very vicious back in those days, but in one sense it was sort of directed
[01:11:52.642 --> 01:11:57.425]  It was directed, you know, towards one side to the other, you know, and the people were kind of in the middle.
[01:11:57.765 --> 01:12:06.789]  And now that has devolved into this absolute, you know, brutal anarchy, where people are just running around, you know, murdering other people.
[01:12:07.049 --> 01:12:17.014]  And there's all kinds of criminal behavior in the context of, you know, drugs and power.
[01:12:17.334 --> 01:12:18.175]  You were talking about...
[01:12:19.345 --> 01:12:25.171]  Uh, the article earlier, we put it on screen, mainstream news article, about 900 dead bus drivers in one year.
[01:12:25.972 --> 01:12:29.956]  Exactly, and that, I mean, that under... Don't just take the wallet off the bus driver, just shoot him in the head.
[01:12:30.663 --> 01:12:33.525]  Well, I think that a lot of what that is, is they charge extortion.
[01:12:33.605 --> 01:12:46.036]  So if you are a person that can't protect yourself, they don't have the ability to have guns in Guatemala, because just like Mexico, you know, they don't have the second... I told the story of the Mexican army pulling over the tour bus and taking all the guy's money.
[01:12:46.396 --> 01:12:46.716]  Exactly.
[01:12:46.736 --> 01:12:47.677]  And him getting on crying.
[01:12:47.917 --> 01:12:51.980]  So if you can't protect yourself, this is the... But if I don't want to live like that, I'm a racist.
[01:12:52.381 --> 01:12:52.861]  Exactly.
[01:12:52.881 --> 01:12:56.104]  This is a perfect example of why the Second Amendment is important.
[01:12:56.144 --> 01:12:58.306]  Because if you can't protect yourself... But these people come up
[01:12:58.846 --> 01:13:03.048]  Get in the Democratic Party, and are voting 90 plus percent of the time to take my guns.
[01:13:03.168 --> 01:13:03.548]  On record.
[01:13:03.868 --> 01:13:04.408]  Absolutely.
[01:13:04.908 --> 01:13:06.829]  And the Mexican TV says take our guns?
[01:13:07.129 --> 01:13:08.330]  I mean, this is outrageous!
[01:13:08.810 --> 01:13:11.431]  And we'll turn them all in under political correctness, I'm telling you.
[01:13:11.571 --> 01:13:13.792]  Right, well it's... I mean, this country is a joke now.
[01:13:14.312 --> 01:13:18.253]  It's an ideology that's clearly being pushed by those that want to control you.
[01:13:18.393 --> 01:13:23.214]  Because if you have the capability to defend yourself, then you won't be robbed.
[01:13:23.254 --> 01:13:25.495]  I mean, that's just as clear as day.
[01:13:25.575 --> 01:13:29.736]  And if people always say, you know, an armed society is a polite society.
[01:13:30.076 --> 01:13:32.497]  Well, what you have down there is the absolute inverse.
[01:13:32.877 --> 01:13:40.179]  It's a savage, brutal society with, you know, zero respect for life and zero compassion for other people.
[01:13:42.515 --> 01:13:49.820]  What's interesting to me is that, you know, when this whole... we're talking about all of this because of the whole open border circumstance, right?
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:51.361]  And the main group now is Guatemalans.
[01:13:51.681 --> 01:13:52.081]  Exactly.
[01:13:52.141 --> 01:13:54.543]  Or, as Biden calls them, our children.
[01:13:55.203 --> 01:14:01.287]  And, you know, it's Guatemala and it's El Salvador and it's Honduras and those are all the... Hell pits!
[01:14:01.647 --> 01:14:06.350]  They're all the poorest, like, worst circumstances in Central America.
[01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:07.511]  And, you know, probably in this
[01:14:07.551 --> 01:14:07.831]  I don't know.
[01:14:25.069 --> 01:14:30.632]  And to me, the issue is that the liberals are going to paint this as, oh, let's be compassionate to these people.
[01:14:30.792 --> 01:14:39.097]  They're just children that are running from a war-torn circumstance, and that they're refugees.
[01:14:39.397 --> 01:14:40.918]  Well, in a sense, yes, that's true.
[01:14:41.198 --> 01:14:44.720]  But this has been going on for 36 years!
[01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:46.321]  It's not like it just started!
[01:14:46.701 --> 01:14:49.923]  So to me, that compassion rings utterly hollow.
[01:14:50.103 --> 01:15:00.970]  Because they're only saying that now in the context of the circumstance of these borders being open and they're letting all these thugs with tattoos all over their faces that would kill your kid for no reason at all whatsoever.
[01:15:01.511 --> 01:15:03.172]  It's mind-blowing.
[01:15:03.252 --> 01:15:16.921]  I mean because in Guatemala and Mexico now it's literal devil cults that are into total death and corruption and into dying young and they just find a border patrol agent and his dad fishing and kill him in front of the mother for no reason.
[01:15:19.204 --> 01:15:20.205]  Not even because they were Border Patrol.
[01:15:20.225 --> 01:15:21.246]  They just wanted to rob them.
[01:15:21.846 --> 01:15:23.848]  And it's just, it's like, oh, you're so wonderful.
[01:15:24.168 --> 01:15:24.869]  We love you.
[01:15:24.929 --> 01:15:30.933]  And Robert Rodriguez says, La Reconquista, La Reconquista, as he lives, you know, he's got hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:15:31.394 --> 01:15:32.154]  Well, it's unconscionable.
[01:15:32.174 --> 01:15:33.355]  And it's just crazy town.
[01:15:33.435 --> 01:15:35.697]  It's unconscionable and it's utterly immoral.
[01:15:35.757 --> 01:15:42.162]  It's one of the most evil things that can happen on the face of the earth is to give power to people like that and let them ravage the society.
[01:15:42.522 --> 01:15:45.125]  And, you know, I have to say that, you know,
[01:15:45.805 --> 01:15:48.987]  Guatemala is my home country and I love the people down there.
[01:15:49.047 --> 01:15:53.969]  They are beautiful, they're hardworking, they're amazing, wonderful people with huge open hearts.
[01:15:54.309 --> 01:15:57.911]  They're fantastic people and it just breaks my heart that this is happening to them.
[01:15:58.031 --> 01:16:00.292]  But they're fed on by a criminal class.
[01:16:00.613 --> 01:16:01.473]  And the way to help
[01:16:01.493 --> 01:16:09.500]  Help them is not to let them come across the border and become welfare recipients and under that power, but to help them with self-determination.
[01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:22.131]  Help them be able to get up by their bootstraps and change what's happening inside of those countries by our influence, which is what the USA through the CIA has been doing the absolute opposite of that for 36 years.
[01:16:24.213 --> 01:16:33.900]  We are at fault to some degree with what is happening down there, but it's not going to be fixed by letting them all come up here and take advantage of the system that we have.
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:44.247]  Well, especially when it's Akron and the Chicago mob literally planning to use them as mules and just exploit them and run fake tax returns through them.
[01:16:44.887 --> 01:16:49.090]  I mean, the Democratic Party literally is an organized crime syndicate.
[01:16:49.530 --> 01:16:51.292]  I mean, they run the rackets, everything.
[01:16:51.812 --> 01:16:59.795]  The thing that is one of the biggest ironies of this whole thing to me is that I just came from 10 years in Chicago, is that Rahm Emanuel said send him up here.
[01:17:00.626 --> 01:17:01.767]  Send them to Chicago!
[01:17:02.327 --> 01:17:02.787]  You know what?
[01:17:02.827 --> 01:17:07.009]  First of all, Chicago can't even keep what's going on with themselves together.
[01:17:07.569 --> 01:17:10.391]  Chicago has one of the highest murder rates in the country.
[01:17:10.431 --> 01:17:10.911]  In the world.
[01:17:11.011 --> 01:17:14.553]  It's a beautiful, wonderful, amazing, gorgeous city, and I love it to death.
[01:17:14.893 --> 01:17:20.396]  But, you know, you gotta fix your own house before you start inviting all this into your house, you know?
[01:17:20.936 --> 01:17:22.617]  That's just so ludicrous.
[01:17:22.657 --> 01:17:25.318]  It doesn't make any sense to me at all whatsoever from any perspective.
[01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:33.253]  And we're on the radio in Chicago, and they're great people, and one neighborhood's safe and nice, the next neighborhood's a literal... But it's just creeping in everywhere.
[01:17:34.774 --> 01:17:38.096]  The Democrats really are just... And I'm not glorifying Republicans.
[01:17:38.556 --> 01:17:39.856]  They've got all their own corruption problems.
[01:17:39.876 --> 01:17:43.358]  But the Democrats themselves really are deviants, Buckley.
[01:17:44.178 --> 01:17:47.040]  And by deviants, they really like screwing stuff up.
[01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:53.113]  They're the type of people that you'd invite to a party who would get up and crap in the punch bowl.
[01:17:53.253 --> 01:17:54.193]  I mean, I'm really serious.
[01:17:54.693 --> 01:17:55.694]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:17:56.154 --> 01:17:56.874]  I believe that's true.
[01:17:56.914 --> 01:18:07.320]  And if you look at what's happening in Chicago, if you look at a sort of a heat map of where all the murders have occurred in Chicago, they're basically west of the city and then south, southwest of the city.
[01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:10.981]  And those are the two major Hispanic and black populations.
[01:18:12.302 --> 01:18:20.903]  When you go down there and you actually drive through all these neighborhoods and you talk to these people, you see that the vast majority of those people are on welfare.
[01:18:21.024 --> 01:18:29.485]  The vast majority of those people are trapped inside of that system and they are not going to self-determinate out of that because they're in a very vicious cycle.
[01:18:29.545 --> 01:18:31.805]  And that's what the liberals want to promote.
[01:18:31.885 --> 01:18:38.827]  They want to bring all these people up from Guatemala that are already in a hellhole and put them into that system.
[01:18:39.407 --> 01:18:41.167]  Well, it'll kind of be a cherry on top then.
[01:18:41.767 --> 01:18:43.908]  Well, yeah, I guess so.
[01:18:44.468 --> 01:18:53.573]  But it just, if you back away, you back away from all the hysteria, you pull out, you pull away from all the politics and everything else, it's irrational.
[01:18:54.393 --> 01:19:03.838]  And the only way that it could be rationalized is if they were looking for more people to control, but to have more people that were dependent upon the state.
[01:19:04.338 --> 01:19:07.520]  Because it doesn't make any sense in any other- Well, they admit it's clouded in heaven.
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:09.041]  It's agenda 21.
[01:19:09.081 --> 01:19:09.902]  It's wrecked the country.
[01:19:10.222 --> 01:19:10.742]  Exactly.
[01:19:10.762 --> 01:19:14.126]  I mean I was reading where in Chicago all these new taxes Emmanuel put in.
[01:19:14.646 --> 01:19:22.954]  Something like when you sell your place it's double the tax and just harassing everyone and I mean that's the model they want us to live under.
[01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:24.841]  Exactly, it's horrific.
[01:19:25.622 --> 01:19:31.167]  I mean, the taxes in Chicago are, I think they are literally the highest in the country.
[01:19:32.368 --> 01:19:40.195]  And let me tell you, like, downtown is gorgeous, they put out beautiful flowers and they really manicure it and everything else, but that city is
[01:19:40.775 --> 01:19:43.977]  Utterly and literally one of the most corrupt cities in the United States.
[01:19:45.138 --> 01:19:51.202]  And it's an incubator for what the liberal policies... And they run attacks against the Second Amendment out of there.
[01:19:51.643 --> 01:19:57.887]  It's an evil fortress of scum in government attacking anything good in the country.
[01:19:58.287 --> 01:19:58.728]  Exactly.
[01:19:59.088 --> 01:20:00.429]  Buckley Hammond, thanks for coming in.
[01:20:00.449 --> 01:20:02.370]  We're gonna take this video report, get it up.

[01:21:18.652 --> 01:21:20.694]  China and Russia bypassing the dollar.
[01:21:21.174 --> 01:21:22.735]  Life is getting ready to change.

[01:23:05.959 --> 01:23:10.822]  Next to water and food, you need a safe, storable fuel supply for your preparedness needs.
[01:23:11.302 --> 01:23:13.043]  Spare fuel is the answer.
[01:23:13.283 --> 01:23:16.745]  Spare fuel can be used in any gas-powered vehicle or generator.
[01:23:17.065 --> 01:23:20.847]  Spare fuel is perfect for any unforeseen out-of-gas emergencies.
[01:23:21.248 --> 01:23:27.571]  Unlike gasoline, spare fuel is safe to store with your other supplies, and it can be stored for many years.

[01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:44.655]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:23:44.695 --> 01:23:45.435]  This capitalism?
[01:23:45.495 --> 01:23:51.599]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:23:51.659 --> 01:23:55.301]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:23:55.341 --> 01:23:56.261]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[01:23:56.281 --> 01:23:57.642]  It's time to understand the system.
[01:23:57.682 --> 01:23:57.962]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:58.002 --> 01:23:58.282]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:24:20.532 --> 01:24:23.133]  Here we are, folks, sending out a global SOS.
[01:24:23.253 --> 01:24:26.974]  We have deciphered the globalist chaos program of control.
[01:24:26.994 --> 01:24:31.915]  To destroy free markets and bring in a global tyranny.
[01:24:34.256 --> 01:24:37.097]  To attack any institution that sound like the family.
[01:24:38.397 --> 01:24:41.438]  This is the Jacobin-Illuminati plan to overthrow reality.
[01:24:41.818 --> 01:24:47.160]  We'll be talking about it with Mark Dice and tying it in to Katy Perry and more coming up in the next segment.
[01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:50.041]  That's why I mentioned the Illuminati earlier in the transmission today.
[01:24:51.561 --> 01:25:15.294]  But if you want to understand Obama, over the evening, into today, multiple bombing attacks inside Iraq, in the region of Kurdistan, where the IS or ISIS, really it's Al-Qaeda, on record, that's who they are, group, rebranded by the globalists and NATO, armed by them, has been taking over large parts of the country.
[01:25:15.714 --> 01:25:20.357]  But the original globalist plan, which is public, is to break the country in three parts.
[01:25:22.076 --> 01:25:23.518]  The Kurds get an area.
[01:25:25.442 --> 01:25:26.604]  ISIS gets an area.
[01:25:27.325 --> 01:25:28.607]  And the Shiites get an area.
[01:25:29.108 --> 01:25:30.029]  And that's the public plan.
[01:25:31.175 --> 01:25:31.735]  By public.
[01:25:32.235 --> 01:25:43.638]  It's talked about in the Council on Foreign Relations publications, it's in scholarly documents, but they go on the news and go, we don't know where they came from, we don't know why they have stinger missiles, jeepers, creepers!
[01:25:44.459 --> 01:25:46.339]  They talk to you like you're five years old, okay?
[01:25:46.799 --> 01:25:48.220]  So what you're hearing is not my opinion.
[01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:49.340]  This is what's going on.
[01:25:49.780 --> 01:25:50.900]  And no one else will tell you.
[01:25:51.181 --> 01:25:52.481]  I wish everyone else would tell you.
[01:25:53.274 --> 01:25:57.536]  We finally got Rand Paul and Ted Cruz to talk about, we're not Al-Qaeda's air force in Syria.
[01:25:58.477 --> 01:25:59.478]  That's right next door.
[01:25:59.738 --> 01:26:10.664]  That's where this group, fresh from killing hundreds of thousands of Christians and non-radical Muslims, and anybody that doesn't have a big beard, anybody whose wife, you know, knows how to talk and isn't locked up in the back bedroom.
[01:26:12.423 --> 01:26:16.745]  I got ISIS websites and people threatening me now all over the web, looking up and attacking me.
[01:26:16.785 --> 01:26:17.865]  I mean, what a bunch of scum.
[01:26:18.145 --> 01:26:25.468]  All a bunch of globalist front cutouts, allowed to operate on Facebook and everywhere else, but if I have a crooked toenail, the SWAT team shows up.
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:33.703]  Remember the headline two weeks ago that ISIS is allowed to operate on YouTube, on Facebook, on Twitter?
[01:26:34.124 --> 01:26:35.785]  And the government says, let them operate.
[01:26:36.005 --> 01:26:37.186]  We track them that way.
[01:26:37.266 --> 01:26:38.226]  Give me a break.
[01:26:38.927 --> 01:26:40.508]  Now again, they don't run them.
[01:26:40.788 --> 01:26:42.629]  They fund them and open the door for them.
[01:26:42.949 --> 01:26:46.812]  Like throwing a newborn baby in with starving pit bulls that have rabies.
[01:26:48.713 --> 01:26:49.133]  You understand?
[01:26:49.173 --> 01:26:50.534]  I'm not saying they don't exist.
[01:26:50.554 --> 01:26:55.017]  The media will go, he says there's no such thing as ISIS and that we didn't have the moon landings.
[01:26:55.397 --> 01:26:56.417]  That's how they lie to you.
[01:26:56.718 --> 01:26:56.838]  No.
[01:26:58.018 --> 01:27:01.641]  What I'm telling you is on record, and here's where you read about it.
[01:27:03.243 --> 01:27:19.037]  In late 2001, they had generals and colonels, a colonel in special forces, told the San Francisco Chronicle first, and one guy got kicked out of the army over it, because they said, we would just bomb emplacements of 12 and 14-year-old conscripts in front of Kabul and other areas.
[01:27:19.858 --> 01:27:22.159]  We would shell them and kill these little kids once we got there.
[01:27:22.659 --> 01:27:25.140]  We were not allowed to attack real Al-Qaeda Taliban bases.
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:32.503]  They would then literally wait for us when we got there and we would pay them in gold and load them on C-130s.
[01:27:32.543 --> 01:27:35.704]  This is when the Times of London had the stuff about the gold.
[01:27:36.164 --> 01:27:39.625]  And fly them over the mountains to Pakistani intelligence.
[01:27:39.886 --> 01:27:45.768]  And I've had the former head of Pakistani intelligence, Hamid Gulhan, who won't talk to anybody else in the West,
[01:27:46.508 --> 01:27:53.492]  Who's the former head of the Pakistani intelligence and ran the CIA operations there over defeating the Russians.
[01:27:54.213 --> 01:27:55.473]  And he concurs with my analysis.
[01:27:55.834 --> 01:27:57.214]  This is exactly what happened, okay?
[01:27:58.115 --> 01:28:04.299]  So they fly them over to start the operation to destabilize Pakistan and give the West an excuse to attack Pakistan.
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:08.741]  And then to stir up the rest of the radical Muslims there.
[01:28:09.041 --> 01:28:09.762]  So I'm going to explain.
[01:28:10.142 --> 01:28:13.044]  This is like putting fire ants in somebody's bed, okay?
[01:28:14.022 --> 01:28:14.642]  That's what they do.
[01:28:14.822 --> 01:28:27.186]  They pour Al-Qaeda in, they pour Akhani Network people in, they pour, then they give them Saudi funding, that's on record, and then they run around killing everybody, but they don't want them getting into the Kurd area or the Shiite area.
[01:28:27.446 --> 01:28:33.548]  The deal, the triple cross with Iran and Saudi Arabia is to divide up Iraq in three parts.
[01:28:33.928 --> 01:28:34.848]  Kurds get part of it.
[01:28:36.088 --> 01:28:39.450]  The IS gets a new part of it to run their attacks into Syria forever.
[01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:41.611]  They have plausible deniability and give U.S.
[01:28:41.671 --> 01:28:43.352]  weapons to them and other weapons.
[01:28:43.932 --> 01:28:49.535]  And then the Iranian Shiites get part of the south and east bordering Iran.
[01:28:49.775 --> 01:28:50.495]  That's what's going on!
[01:28:50.675 --> 01:29:01.581]  It's pure evil, butchering the country, de-industrializing it, killing over a million Iraqis, all our troops dying, shutting it down, and now turning it over to people that are killing every Christian in the nation.
[01:29:02.611 --> 01:29:12.754]  But when they start getting too far into the Kurd areas, and we're going to blow up the dam, and take the oil fields, oh now Obama, because he doesn't run them, he funds them and opens the door for them.
[01:29:14.775 --> 01:29:27.459]  When they start getting into the oil fields, oh sorry, you can have these oil fields to get your weapons and overthrow Syria, and diminish Jordan, and all our supposed allies who our government's trying to overthrow.
[01:29:27.679 --> 01:29:29.619]  Egypt, Jordan, all of them.
[01:29:29.699 --> 01:29:31.200]  Al Qaeda's attacking Jordan now.
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:32.820]  Al Qaeda's attacking?
[01:29:33.421 --> 01:29:43.085]  I mean, because if the leaders wear suit and ties and women are somewhat free and you go to movie theaters and there's food on the shelves and it's stable, the globalists don't want that.
[01:29:43.105 --> 01:29:46.226]  Just like they're shipping in people from failed third world nations here.
[01:29:46.446 --> 01:29:50.248]  They want to destabilize everything and screw everything up.
[01:29:50.948 --> 01:29:52.188]  It's called world government.
[01:29:52.509 --> 01:29:53.309]  That's what this is.
[01:29:53.329 --> 01:29:54.549]  And there's been heat on Obama.
[01:29:54.829 --> 01:29:55.530]  Not fighting him.
[01:29:55.690 --> 01:29:57.090]  So he's done this bombing as well.
[01:29:57.110 --> 01:29:57.910]  Totally fake.
[01:29:58.230 --> 01:30:00.431]  Proudly bombed empty buildings.
[01:30:00.671 --> 01:30:01.711]  Total crap.
[01:30:01.812 --> 01:30:02.592]  Total bull.
[01:30:02.632 --> 01:30:05.633]  Like Clinton bombing that aspirin factory in Nigeria.
[01:30:05.653 --> 01:30:06.153]  Remember that?
[01:30:07.458 --> 01:30:14.520]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:30:14.620 --> 01:30:16.761]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:30:16.941 --> 01:30:22.042]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:30:22.242 --> 01:30:27.164]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:30:27.404 --> 01:30:30.467]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:30:30.727 --> 01:30:34.591]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:30:34.811 --> 01:30:39.035]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:30:39.136 --> 01:30:49.105]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:30:49.365 --> 01:30:51.888]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:30:52.048 --> 01:31:00.121]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:31:00.261 --> 01:31:04.248]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:31:08.151 --> 01:31:09.932]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grew.
[01:31:10.453 --> 01:31:17.437]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[01:31:17.877 --> 01:31:28.284]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7,000 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[01:31:28.705 --> 01:31:37.951]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[01:31:38.671 --> 01:31:42.094]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[01:31:42.734 --> 01:31:46.177]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[01:31:46.497 --> 01:31:48.098]  Experience the new formula.
[01:31:48.559 --> 01:31:50.540]  Experience the ancient purity.
[01:31:51.141 --> 01:31:52.141]  Shield your family.
[01:31:52.462 --> 01:31:53.883]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:31:54.283 --> 01:31:56.885]  Available now at Infowarslife.com.

[01:32:06.539 --> 01:32:08.440]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[01:32:08.761 --> 01:32:16.426]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:32:16.806 --> 01:32:24.091]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:32:24.371 --> 01:32:28.614]  I just received my Male Vitality about three days ago and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[01:32:28.954 --> 01:32:39.118]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[01:32:39.578 --> 01:32:45.740]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[01:32:46.061 --> 01:32:48.301]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.

[01:32:52.443 --> 01:32:54.044]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[01:32:54.404 --> 01:32:58.326]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.
[01:32:58.566 --> 01:33:05.489]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[01:33:15.530 --> 01:33:19.936]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:33:20.557 --> 01:33:22.039]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:33:45.217 --> 01:33:47.798]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:47.858 --> 01:33:48.939]  until 2 p.m.
[01:33:49.079 --> 01:33:50.260]  Central Standard Time.
[01:33:50.720 --> 01:34:02.366]  We're here, the tip of the spear when it comes to promoting truth, justice, the American way, worldwide, the true spirit of 1776, not the counterfeit Illuminati spirit of 1776.
[01:34:03.666 --> 01:34:08.329]  And I started out the broadcast today talking about George Washington.
[01:34:09.537 --> 01:34:12.641]  Who is one of the greatest men who's ever lived, if you know his true story.
[01:34:12.682 --> 01:34:23.918]  Just an incredible person of integrity, of strength, across the board of stamina, of endurance, of leadership, of male prowess.
[01:34:25.490 --> 01:34:27.051]  And he fought the Illuminati.
[01:34:27.071 --> 01:34:38.794]  You can read his letters, George Washington's letters on the Illuminati, trying to take over masonry in the United States, trying to control a revolution, make it like the bloody French Revolution that came a few years later in 1800 or so that he predicted.
[01:34:43.274 --> 01:34:47.415]  So a lot of people project that on the Founding Fathers, and it's more sophisticated.
[01:34:47.435 --> 01:34:57.697]  It was a lot of Christians, it was a lot of deists, theists, a lot of different people that came together, but it was a renaissance against all forms of oppression.
[01:34:58.277 --> 01:35:02.498]  And so there was a fake revolution in France out of the Illuminati to bring that in.
[01:35:02.558 --> 01:35:07.479]  Now, Katy Perry, in fact, guys, I've got a stack of articles out there I forgot to bring in.
[01:35:07.499 --> 01:35:09.519]  Will you bring me the Katy Perry articles in?
[01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:09.980]  Thank you.
[01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:11.620]  Katy Perry
[01:35:14.008 --> 01:35:17.169]  Came out in a cover story in Rolling Stone last week.
[01:35:18.930 --> 01:35:20.491]  And I've had her dad on the show.
[01:35:20.691 --> 01:35:22.852]  She, of course, was married to Russell Brand.
[01:35:23.812 --> 01:35:26.573]  And Russell Brand has been on the show a few times and said he is a listener.
[01:35:26.613 --> 01:35:27.674]  We can try to get him back on.
[01:35:28.034 --> 01:35:28.534]  I like Russell.
[01:35:28.554 --> 01:35:29.355]  I think he's a real person.
[01:35:29.375 --> 01:35:30.775]  I don't agree with everything he says.
[01:35:30.815 --> 01:35:31.676]  He doesn't agree with me on everything.
[01:35:31.996 --> 01:35:32.776]  But he's a truth seeker.
[01:35:33.416 --> 01:35:34.537]  And, you know, they would listen to the show.
[01:35:35.552 --> 01:35:37.093]  That's part of their awakening.
[01:35:37.413 --> 01:35:39.854]  He got more away from wanting to be Illuminati-esque.
[01:35:40.375 --> 01:35:41.635]  She got more into it.
[01:35:42.076 --> 01:35:52.461]  And I'm going to leave it at that, because I was able to get to know Katy Perry's dad, because he's a pastor and friends with Dave Mustaine, of course, of Megadeth.
[01:35:53.582 --> 01:35:58.244]  But, long story short, there really isn't an Illuminati.
[01:35:58.684 --> 01:36:03.247]  There is an Illuminati mindset, but the original Illuminati did exist.
[01:36:04.710 --> 01:36:18.679]  I've talked to high-level movie stars and government people who have told me that they have been part of sex, orgy, magic rituals under government facilities in places like London.
[01:36:20.077 --> 01:36:20.598]  I don't know.
[01:36:41.534 --> 01:36:44.176]  And they were really exposing some stuff there.
[01:36:45.036 --> 01:36:46.217]  I'm just going to leave it at that as well.
[01:36:47.217 --> 01:36:50.699]  But John Lennon, before he died, was waking up to all this and did some songs about it.
[01:36:50.739 --> 01:36:51.940]  I'm not allowed to talk about that either.
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:53.381]  I'm just going to stop right there.
[01:36:53.441 --> 01:36:56.663]  But a lot of people confided in me pretty amazing information.
[01:36:56.683 --> 01:36:59.164]  Not specific names or anything.
[01:36:59.184 --> 01:37:00.425]  I don't want a hit team to come kill me.
[01:37:00.905 --> 01:37:13.656]  The whole point is that there are these subgroups that carry it on, but really, satanic rituals, Luciferian rituals, is more about hyping themselves up and being willing to do bizarre things.
[01:37:14.977 --> 01:37:20.261]  And that's the opposite of who George Washington was, a deep, devout Christian, who spoke up against it and fought it.
[01:37:21.482 --> 01:37:28.588]  But when Katy Perry comes out and says, people, Sam and the Illuminati, and they mention InfoWars.com in the news article,
[01:37:30.816 --> 01:37:32.677]  But I'm not, but I'd like to be part of it.
[01:37:33.078 --> 01:37:34.078]  That's what she's saying.
[01:37:34.398 --> 01:37:37.160]  They're adopting it as an archetype or as an image.
[01:37:37.621 --> 01:37:46.366]  Where almost every Super Bowl or almost every Grammy or Emmy, there's big pyramids, women as witches, fire shooting out, ritualized sex magic.
[01:37:47.587 --> 01:37:49.368]  Why is the elite showing this now?
[01:37:49.469 --> 01:37:50.849]  Why are they pushing this now?
[01:37:51.230 --> 01:37:52.811]  Why are they promoting this now?
[01:37:55.026 --> 01:37:57.168]  Well, it's because they're trying to bring their great work in.
[01:37:57.188 --> 01:38:11.500]  I remember on the year 2000, they were going to cap the pyramid at Giza, and then they said this elite group on PBS, they reported, had decided the great work was not done yet, and they weren't going to cap it.
[01:38:12.401 --> 01:38:13.542]  Well, what is that great work?
[01:38:13.882 --> 01:38:17.044]  Mark Dice has written a whole bunch of best-selling books on it.
[01:38:17.344 --> 01:38:18.645]  He's got a new book coming out.
[01:38:19.166 --> 01:38:21.167]  He's done a lot of research on the Illuminati.
[01:38:21.767 --> 01:38:26.151]  And we'll have Mark about 5-10 minutes into the next hour.
[01:38:26.811 --> 01:38:30.033]  We have a guest coming in studio, a great lawyer friend of mine.
[01:38:30.814 --> 01:38:35.897]  But before we go any further, I want to give you the floor to break this down for people.
[01:38:35.977 --> 01:38:38.119]  Because when you talk about the Illuminati,
[01:38:39.895 --> 01:38:45.519]  People that used to join the Illuminati at the outer levels were the best people in society, believing it was a renaissance.
[01:38:46.639 --> 01:38:57.206]  But in the inner group, it was actually about overthrowing all orders, and trampling and being trampled on, and evil for evil's sake, turning the sky into fire, things like that.
[01:38:57.606 --> 01:38:59.768]  Extremely nihilistic, pro-death.
[01:39:01.425 --> 01:39:02.705]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[01:39:26.135 --> 01:39:26.655]  Appreciate it.
[01:39:26.675 --> 01:39:52.951]  Yeah, five years ago hardly anybody knew about the Illuminati or the only people who did were in Patriot circles like your listeners and people had to seek out the truth to find the Illuminati but through social media with Facebook and Twitter becoming so popular the word has gotten out Dan Brown's popular book Angels and Demons was partially responsible for this but whitewashing the Illuminati making them seem as if they were the good guys and so we have an interesting scenario today where
[01:39:53.511 --> 01:40:05.254]  It went from being a very secretive society to hardly anybody knowing about it, only a few people had written books about it, to now everybody supposedly thinks they know about it and it's become a part of pop culture.
[01:40:05.334 --> 01:40:18.737]  As you said, the cover of Rolling Stone this week is Katy Perry with an Illuminati eye earring and in the article they mention InfoWars and she says, yeah, she wants to be a part of the Illuminati and it's interesting, most people, the pop culture
[01:40:18.997 --> 01:40:29.886]  Maniacs believe that the Illuminati is just a secret society of celebrities and of course in this Babylonian fallen society that's the number one goal of most people and it serves two purposes.
[01:40:29.966 --> 01:40:34.370]  It serves to condition the masses that their controllers are cool.
[01:40:34.430 --> 01:40:39.134]  They're the ultimate power structure that the little peon public want to be a part of.
[01:40:39.614 --> 01:40:54.631]  But this is also serving to help externalize the hierarchy because as we know the one world coming religion is going to be that of Luciferianism or Satanism and they're all building up this big new old order Orwellian police state unified currency.
[01:40:55.531 --> 01:41:00.114]  To unleash this global messiah who will announce that he is God.
[01:41:00.154 --> 01:41:03.756]  This is a fulfillment of various prophecies and various religions.
[01:41:03.816 --> 01:41:13.682]  And so, when this ultimately happens, it could be 30 years, it could be 50 years, it seems that we're in the final few pages of this experiment.
[01:41:14.361 --> 01:41:26.401]  Because of these pop stars promoting the Illuminati as cool, promoting Satanism as cool, I mean, we have Kesha literally posting satanic pentagrams on our Facebook page, drinking out of a heart, drinking blood out of a heart on stage.
[01:41:27.239 --> 01:41:41.963]  This global masonic messiah, this counterfeit Christ, will be hailed as the new king of the world, as unveiling this royal secret of the secret societies, which is ultimately that they have been worshipping Lucifer.
[01:41:42.383 --> 01:41:52.646]  And it's interesting to see this pop culture Illuminati brand sort of muddy the water so much that most people have no idea about the real Illuminati.
[01:41:52.946 --> 01:41:56.007]  You mentioned some of the real actual history of it in the past.
[01:41:56.047 --> 01:41:56.227]  I mean,
[01:41:56.927 --> 01:42:06.829]  Adam Weisop, the founder of the Bavarian Illuminati, Bavaria is a southern state in Germany where he founded this, really modernized the ancient mystery school, secret society.
[01:42:07.109 --> 01:42:07.970]  He was a communist.
[01:42:08.370 --> 01:42:18.312]  I mean, he was a tyrant, a scumbag, unlike our founding fathers who wrote out their grievances on paper, signed their name to it, and sent it to the king.
[01:42:18.852 --> 01:42:31.542]  Adam Weisshaupt took a different approach and that was to deceive other people that he supposedly was helping with his Illuminati organization and we can get into some of the actual writings I could read.
[01:42:31.582 --> 01:42:34.605]  Yeah, let's talk about that because I've read those and I mean they're public.
[01:42:34.625 --> 01:42:35.846]  It's Encyclopedia Britannica.
[01:42:36.626 --> 01:42:39.769]  But you've gone out and dug out the actual manuscripts that have larger quotes.
[01:42:40.129 --> 01:42:44.893]  How they would manipulate the best in society to believe the Illuminati had this great goal.
[01:42:45.213 --> 01:42:46.974]  Look, we want to help the immigrant children.
[01:42:47.274 --> 01:42:48.676]  Turn your guns in for the children.
[01:42:49.096 --> 01:42:54.160]  But in truth, their plan was the overthrow of reality itself and the destruction of human life.
[01:42:55.558 --> 01:43:01.724]  Everything we see today, it's been modernized, but it has roots back to this cabal, this Adam Weisshaupt cabal.
[01:43:01.764 --> 01:43:07.910]  And, you know, the people that go to Wikipedia for a source say, oh, well, it was abolished and it disintegrated in 1787.
[01:43:08.731 --> 01:43:10.112]  That's what Wikipedia says.
[01:43:10.212 --> 01:43:15.157]  Well, there was actually a fourth edict by the Duke of Bavaria issued.
[01:43:15.197 --> 01:43:16.258]  An edict is an act of law.
[01:43:17.039 --> 01:43:17.319]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:43:36.602 --> 01:43:46.127]  Three years later, in 1790, the Duke of Bavaria issued a fourth edict where he actually said that they were continuing to expand.
[01:43:46.147 --> 01:43:48.188]  I mean, I can read some of the edict here.
[01:43:48.228 --> 01:43:54.190]  Well, George Washington wrote parcels of letters decrying their infiltration of the U.S.
[01:43:54.250 --> 01:43:59.433]  military, this is after he was president, after he retired, and their infiltration of masonry.
[01:44:00.529 --> 01:44:03.211]  And that was after they were supposedly extinguished.
[01:44:03.351 --> 01:44:09.555]  And the person who took over the Illuminati after Adam Weisshaupt had fled Bavaria was a man named J.J.C.
[01:44:09.615 --> 01:44:11.156]  Bode, Johann Bode.
[01:44:11.677 --> 01:44:29.189]  And his journal has been published, and he met with some high-level Masons in France, and introduced in his own journal, he says, that he introduced the Illuminati into Masonic lodges, into what he called, they renamed it the Philadelphs, and into the Jacobin Society, as you had mentioned.
[01:44:29.309 --> 01:44:31.450]  Well, George Washington was a master mason.
[01:44:31.470 --> 01:44:33.990]  Well, a master mason, as you know Alex, is only a third level.
[01:44:52.595 --> 01:44:54.478]  It has nothing to do even with the Scottish Rite.
[01:44:54.538 --> 01:44:55.279]  Well, exactly.
[01:44:55.339 --> 01:44:57.261]  Plus, I'm not even defending masonry.
[01:44:57.401 --> 01:44:59.564]  But, I mean, I've had a lot of family that were high-level masons.
[01:44:59.884 --> 01:45:01.266]  The best people you could imagine.
[01:45:01.587 --> 01:45:01.907]  It was giant.
[01:45:03.650 --> 01:45:16.454]  ancient mystery schools that went back to King Solomon's temple and beyond and so within masonry in the higher degrees are basically all the secret pre-christian stuff including Judaic.
[01:45:16.994 --> 01:45:26.937]  So if you really want to get into it, it's Egyptian and Judaic and it actually gets into the white priesthood of Egypt and then you have kind of the Sith, that's the Star Wars
[01:45:27.697 --> 01:45:38.139]  modern cosmologies, you have the Sith that are the dark side of it, and then you have the Jedi's that are the good side of it, and of course that's New Age-y, because it's the old age, it's ancient.
[01:45:38.399 --> 01:45:55.462]  I'm not even defending it, it's just that it wasn't something to supplant Christianity, it was the Masons that built most of the cathedrals in Europe, it's that it always had that Illuminati Sith vein in it, and then it was re-flowering under the Jacobins and under Adam Weisshaupt.
[01:45:56.454 --> 01:46:19.324]  Manly P. Hall, a 33rd degree mason, considered to be masonry's greatest philosopher by the governing body of Freemasonry, wrote in his book, The Secret Teachings of All Ages, which your viewers can see is here on my shelf, that he believed that the secret societies, the mystery schools, got taken over, like you said, you call them the Sith, making a Star Wars reference, but got taken over by
[01:46:20.024 --> 01:46:36.658]  Corrupt men that hijacked these really just early fraternities, early universities, and then kept everybody out of the way, kept everybody dumbed down, and it's a perversion, really, of the ancient and early sciences.
[01:46:37.178 --> 01:46:45.545]  And in many Masonic books themselves, I mean, they will admit that Freemasonry is a secret society within a secret society.
[01:46:46.165 --> 01:46:52.270]  And if you read the original writings, I hated history in school, but I've come to love it in the last 10 years.
[01:46:52.550 --> 01:46:59.055]  Well, they try to make it as boring as possible and only create division with it and basically teach baloney.
[01:47:00.077 --> 01:47:08.623]  I mean, if you actually look, you know, people talking about the Illuminati, this, and it's becoming a joke, really, if you search social media, because so many people think they know about it.
[01:47:09.043 --> 01:47:15.808]  Oh, yeah, it's a big pick-up line now for, like, 18-year-old women to tell them, hey, come have sex with me, and I'll teach you about the Illuminati.
[01:47:16.028 --> 01:47:18.250]  And then the idiots doing it have no idea.
[01:47:18.630 --> 01:47:21.332]  It's like people pretending to be Nigerian princes.
[01:47:22.290 --> 01:47:28.912]  I have people from Nigeria contacting me because there's people out there offering to join the Illuminati and charging money.
[01:47:29.192 --> 01:47:41.315]  We had a big figure, an infomercial guy out here in America that sold memberships basically and said that a secret council of former Illuminati members joined him and you could learn the Illuminati secrets for a thousand dollars.
[01:47:41.395 --> 01:47:42.755]  But the real
[01:47:43.055 --> 01:47:48.518]  Yeah, that was Kevin Trudeau, by the way, who I had no idea five, six years ago when he wanted to come on the show and interview him.
[01:47:48.558 --> 01:47:52.760]  I knew him, you know, from promoting herbs and his book and, hey, y'all have a right to sell a book.
[01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:56.101]  I had no idea his other books literally said that.
[01:47:56.121 --> 01:48:01.544]  And then he said he saw aliens at Area 51 and that the aliens talked to him.
[01:48:01.564 --> 01:48:04.465]  And I went to dinner with him and he said, yes, I saw the aliens.
[01:48:04.525 --> 01:48:05.886]  And I said, dude, you're full of bull.
[01:48:06.166 --> 01:48:06.947]  I can tell you're lying.
[01:48:06.967 --> 01:48:07.507]  And I left.
[01:48:07.807 --> 01:48:09.008]  And I'm not throwing him under the bus.
[01:48:09.368 --> 01:48:11.369]  It's just that, yeah, he's another one of these guys.
[01:48:12.584 --> 01:48:14.128]  Yeah, I used to be a big fan of Kevin Chardon.
[01:48:14.168 --> 01:48:15.632]  I have a lot of respect for him as well.
[01:48:15.672 --> 01:48:18.880]  No, no, he wrote some good books that I read, but he also wrote pure crap.
[01:48:19.557 --> 01:48:20.618]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:48:20.798 --> 01:48:29.722]  He is a slick-talking salesman and unfortunately he went off the rail and tried to take advantage of this Illuminati hype and the global information network that he started.
[01:48:29.802 --> 01:48:40.007]  Gin was $1,000 to join and $150 a month to supposedly learn the insider Illuminati secrets from supposed members that have defected.
[01:48:40.087 --> 01:48:42.788]  And who knows, maybe he believes he's telling the truth.
[01:48:42.828 --> 01:48:45.969]  He saw the aliens in Area 51 and, you know, saw the little dead bodies.
[01:48:45.989 --> 01:48:47.270]  And I'm not trying to even attack him.
[01:48:47.530 --> 01:48:49.071]  The point is I was just backing up what you said.
[01:48:50.256 --> 01:48:59.481]  Yeah, and I didn't want to throw him under the bus either, but the point is that in this pop culture mania, the real core Illuminati, the facts, have almost gotten buried.
[01:48:59.521 --> 01:49:07.505]  And my book, The Illuminati Facts and Fiction, came out in 2009, five years ago, before it really started getting to get out of control.
[01:49:07.525 --> 01:49:13.608]  And if you really want to know the truth and the core of the Illuminati, you can look and find their actual original writings.
[01:49:13.648 --> 01:49:14.969]  I mean, they've been translated.
[01:49:15.690 --> 01:49:30.310]  You republish proves of this conspiracy that I read when I was like 15 years old and my dad had an original copy about a hundred years old, or not an original because it would be 200 years old, but he had a reprint from about from like 1898 or something that I read all about the Illuminati.
[01:49:31.212 --> 01:49:38.675]  Yeah, a science professor called Natural Philosophy back then, named John Robeson, published a book which is still available today.
[01:49:38.775 --> 01:49:45.038]  I republished it, Proofs of a Conspiracy, and he included many of the original confiscated writings.
[01:49:45.118 --> 01:49:52.841]  I mean, it's incredible because back then there was obviously no radio, no television, but there were bookstores and magazines and newspapers.
[01:49:53.101 --> 01:50:07.553]  I mean, straight from Adam Weisshop's own pen, he wrote, by establishing reading societies and subscription libraries and taking these under our direction and supplying them through our labors, we may turn the public mind whichever way we want.
[01:50:08.153 --> 01:50:20.984]  In a like manner, we will obtain influence in the military academies, the printing houses, bookseller shops, and in short, all offices which have any effect in either forming or managing or directing the mind of man.
[01:50:22.464 --> 01:50:23.906]  We will get the literary journals.
[01:50:23.986 --> 01:50:35.597]  We will take carefully timed pieces, meaning articles, to make citizens and the princes a little more noticed for certain little slips, meaning to use the media to attack the people.
[01:50:35.617 --> 01:50:40.382]  I mean, he even wrote about using feminism to break down the family, and this was over 200 years ago.
[01:50:40.742 --> 01:50:44.186]  There's no way of influencing men so powerfully as by the means of women.
[01:50:44.586 --> 01:50:45.887]  These should be our chief study.
[01:50:45.927 --> 01:50:58.638]  We should insinuate ourselves in their good opinion, use hints of emancipation from the tyranny of public opinion and of standing up for themselves, and they will be serving us with zeal without even knowing it.
[01:50:58.658 --> 01:51:05.243]  And now Madonna and Katy Perry kneel to the Illuminati and beg to be given admittance on the
[01:51:07.406 --> 01:51:12.092]  The summer is here and nothing looks better than tan skin and white teeth.

[01:52:07.114 --> 01:52:09.696]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:52:09.956 --> 01:52:14.819]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:52:15.079 --> 01:52:22.964]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:52:23.205 --> 01:52:27.527]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:52:27.727 --> 01:52:31.550]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:52:31.710 --> 01:52:37.393]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:52:37.633 --> 01:52:40.435]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:52:40.815 --> 01:52:46.038]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:52:46.178 --> 01:52:54.303]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[01:53:06.661 --> 01:53:11.683]  We travel so much, and having a fake TV, well, it gives added peace of mind.
[01:53:11.843 --> 01:53:14.943]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets.
[01:53:15.344 --> 01:53:21.345]  But fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[01:53:21.465 --> 01:53:33.389]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[01:53:33.709 --> 01:53:38.092]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet, just like a light on a timer.
[01:53:38.292 --> 01:53:39.873]  And they're so easy to use.
[01:53:40.094 --> 01:53:41.975]  You just plug them in and they're ready to go.
[01:53:41.995 --> 01:53:45.717]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[01:53:45.998 --> 01:53:49.160]  Fake TV is only $29.95 with free shipping.
[01:53:49.560 --> 01:53:52.522]  Order your Fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to faketv.com.
[01:53:56.485 --> 01:53:57.346]  That's 877-532-5388 or Faketv.com.
[01:53:57.386 --> 01:53:58.327]  Faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[01:54:19.718 --> 01:54:20.279]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:54:39.614 --> 01:54:43.515]  Really interesting lawyer, Jamie Balasia, is running for political office in Texas.
[01:54:43.835 --> 01:54:46.536]  He's a great radio interview, a lot of great constitutional information.
[01:54:46.976 --> 01:54:52.157]  He was a cop for a long time in Austin, and I ran into him at a concert a while back.
[01:54:52.177 --> 01:54:56.258]  But the point is, is that he's going to be in studio with us, talking about a lot of different issues.
[01:54:57.198 --> 01:55:04.780]  Before we go any further, we've got five minutes left here and five minutes the next segment with Mark Dice, so I want to invite back again very, very soon.
[01:55:06.140 --> 01:55:16.763]  But when you look at what he was just reading, Adam Weishaupt's letters there that are public, that the German government was able to get and confirm, it's all the things we see today.
[01:55:17.243 --> 01:55:19.124]  This is an Illuminati conspiracy.
[01:55:20.024 --> 01:55:21.964]  This is their program of human control.
[01:55:22.024 --> 01:55:27.666]  People ask, well, its roots go back to Germany and France, but where is it today?
[01:55:28.935 --> 01:55:33.778]  There's clear evidence they founded Skull and Bones at Yale, and I want Mark, who's an expert on that, to speak to that.
[01:55:34.298 --> 01:55:35.899]  It then founded CIA.
[01:55:36.339 --> 01:55:37.219]  That's indisputable.
[01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:53.128]  And even major directors put out movies like The Good Shepherd, where it shows a king doing satanic rituals, dressed up as death, with him bathing in feces and being urinated on.
[01:55:54.188 --> 01:55:57.650]  Now, I mean, let me tell you, that's just when they're 20 years old, folks.
[01:55:59.898 --> 01:56:02.679]  And it just gets crazier from there.
[01:56:03.059 --> 01:56:04.699]  So let's get into that, Mark Dice.
[01:56:05.619 --> 01:56:07.880]  What are the errors to the Illuminati today?
[01:56:08.180 --> 01:56:10.000]  More on Skull and Bones and other areas.
[01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:20.083]  Because when you see Katy Perry people, they're groveling, I guess, to make the Illuminati the new royalty, which they claim they wanted to overthrow, but now they're becoming.
[01:56:20.463 --> 01:56:21.463]  Worshipping them.
[01:56:22.813 --> 01:56:45.574]  Yeah, you can see a clear line in history from the Illuminati to Skull and Bones to the Council on Foreign Relations founded in 1921, which your audience is familiar with, but the general public thinks it's a committee in Congress, to the Bilderberg Group, which supposedly just didn't exist for 60 years, and then, well, now it does exist, but it's just not important, to the Bohemian Grove, but there's a couple
[01:56:46.054 --> 01:56:53.999]  Interesting direct connections between the Skull & Bones Society over there at Yale University and the original Bavarian Illuminati in Germany.
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:57.081]  Most people are familiar a little bit with Skull & Bones.
[01:56:57.101 --> 01:57:02.505]  Of course, it's just said to be a fraternity, even though the members don't join until they're a senior.
[01:57:02.585 --> 01:57:08.989]  It's actually a senior society gearing them for a postgraduate network, but you'll never hear that in the mainstream press.
[01:57:09.029 --> 01:57:10.810]  It's just a fraternity of rich kids!
[01:57:11.330 --> 01:57:12.851]  So, Skull & Bones, founded in 1832,
[01:57:14.532 --> 01:57:28.102]  Coincidentally enough, but directly after one of the founders, William Huntington Russell, was studying over in Germany, abroad, just around that same time that the Illuminati went deeper into hiding, expanding their activity and their membership.
[01:57:28.403 --> 01:57:32.786]  So, we have one of the founding members of Skull and Bones, again a senior society,
[01:57:33.986 --> 01:57:49.454]  Studying in Germany, where the Illuminati is active, comes over, found Skull and Bones, the first secret society at Yale University, the first senior society, who, of course, their symbols are all of death and devil worship, but that's not the only connection.
[01:57:49.494 --> 01:57:50.815]  We have a break-in.
[01:57:51.315 --> 01:57:55.742]  Somebody broke in, some students broke into the Skull & Bones headquarters in 1876.
[01:57:57.344 --> 01:57:59.727]  And they called themselves File and Claw.
[01:58:00.028 --> 01:58:01.230]  They published a newsletter.
[01:58:01.770 --> 01:58:06.177]  They used a file and filed away some of the security bars in the headquarters there.
[01:58:06.829 --> 01:58:17.534]  Where, by the way, the members have a session every Thursday night and every Sunday night to prep them for their positions, potentially, within the power structure.
[01:58:18.655 --> 01:58:20.015]  No alcohol is served, of course.
[01:58:20.055 --> 01:58:24.037]  It's not a party, it's a preparatory school for the elite Invisible Empire.
[01:58:24.057 --> 01:58:26.118]  We can get more into it on the other side of the break.
[01:58:26.999 --> 01:58:28.980]  That's right, and of course, if your son
[01:58:30.455 --> 01:58:32.996]  They have five kids, but this son looks like a good prospect.
[01:58:33.016 --> 01:58:33.416]  You send him.
[01:58:33.716 --> 01:58:40.537]  If he doesn't like to worship Satan and have orgies with males and females, he's not going to be ready to cut babies' hearts out later.
[01:58:41.077 --> 01:58:44.238]  And again, cutting a baby's heart out just gets you ready to burn a country down.
[01:58:44.898 --> 01:58:46.759]  Hail Satan, they say.
[01:58:47.239 --> 01:58:48.599]  Well, not me, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:49.059 --> 01:58:50.320]  You can see Satan's world.
[01:58:51.140 --> 01:58:55.181]  Open borders, Ebola being promoted, dollar being devalued, abortion, deaths.
[01:58:57.541 --> 01:59:01.284]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[01:59:01.364 --> 01:59:02.545]  I didn't, I taste dirt in it.
[01:59:02.625 --> 01:59:03.686]  God knows what's in this.
[01:59:03.927 --> 01:59:08.030]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[01:59:08.170 --> 01:59:13.975]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a ProPure G2.0 filtration system.
[01:59:14.115 --> 01:59:15.096]  That one is better.
[01:59:15.156 --> 01:59:16.117]  Tastes like nothing.
[01:59:16.417 --> 01:59:17.818]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like.
[01:59:17.859 --> 01:59:18.359]  It's good water.
[01:59:18.459 --> 01:59:24.203]  Most tap water contains added substances, like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[01:59:24.443 --> 01:59:31.489]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lower IQ, and even cancer.
[01:59:31.689 --> 01:59:34.191]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[01:59:34.391 --> 01:59:42.316]  The ProPure® G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[01:59:42.336 --> 01:59:43.477]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[01:59:43.497 --> 01:59:44.478]  It's good water.
[01:59:44.658 --> 01:59:45.119]  Refreshing?
[01:59:45.279 --> 01:59:45.599]  It's good!

[02:00:13.331 --> 02:00:13.971]  Big Brother.
[02:00:14.632 --> 02:00:15.652]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:16.393 --> 02:00:17.534]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:18.154 --> 02:00:18.974]  You want answers?
[02:00:19.735 --> 02:00:20.635]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:21.276 --> 02:00:24.898]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:25.478 --> 02:00:29.581]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.781 --> 02:00:32.483]  Constitutional lawyer, former police officer, name of Malaysia.
[02:00:32.863 --> 02:00:35.564]  Running for major office in the state of Texas.
[02:00:35.985 --> 02:00:37.386]  Gonna be joining us coming up.
[02:00:38.446 --> 02:00:40.848]  But I want to give Mark Dice the next five minutes the floor.
[02:00:40.928 --> 02:00:43.450]  Mark, show many other facets of the Illuminati.
[02:00:43.470 --> 02:00:44.211]  Keep breaking it down.
[02:00:44.271 --> 02:00:44.972]  It's fascinating.
[02:00:45.832 --> 02:00:49.756]  I want to talk about what these students found when they broke into the Skull & Bones headquarters.
[02:00:49.776 --> 02:00:52.738]  And I certainly don't advocate burglary, but this is what happened.
[02:00:52.758 --> 02:00:59.264]  They broke into this headquarters in 1876, wrote a newsletter, published it, spread it around campus.
[02:00:59.644 --> 02:01:03.247]  And inside this headquarters, which has no windows where they meet every
[02:01:04.127 --> 02:01:12.711]  Thursday and Sunday night for sessions to prepare them for their positions where no alcohol again is served because, you know, just taking over the world's serious business.
[02:01:13.111 --> 02:01:17.513]  They found a plaque on the wall written in German that was given to them by their German brothers.
[02:01:18.273 --> 02:01:23.395]  They also found a plaque with four human skulls, a picture of four human skulls.
[02:01:24.216 --> 02:01:31.560]  And below it was written in German, which one is the king, which one is the beggar, which one is the wise man, and which one is the fool.
[02:01:32.181 --> 02:01:47.610]  And so many people may not understand what that means, but if you read John Robeson's book, one of the first, the first book really written about the Illuminati in English, again covering the original confiscated writings that were confiscated on three different occasions in Germany,
[02:01:48.764 --> 02:02:00.994]  He explained one of the induction rituals to a particular level of the Bavarian German Illuminati, and a candidate was shown a skull and asked whether it was a king, a wise man, a beggar, or a fool.
[02:02:01.395 --> 02:02:07.139]  And then the answer to the riddle is, to them, they said, well, it doesn't matter because all is the same in death.
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:10.542]  And what that means to them is they don't believe in any sort of an afterlife.
[02:02:10.682 --> 02:02:12.604]  It's a social Darwinistic
[02:02:12.984 --> 02:02:13.605]  Philosophy.
[02:02:13.645 --> 02:02:31.997]  And so we have the founder of Skull and Bones studying in Germany where the Illuminati is active, when the Illuminati is expanding, first expanding, coming back, starting a secret society that became so powerful, I mean presidents, starting the CIA, starting the American Educational Society, the Historical Society, etc.
[02:02:32.658 --> 02:02:35.980]  You know, just largely responsible for starting all these bogus wars based on lies.
[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:41.783]  So we have this group with the same goals, the same symbols, the same rituals, the same language.
[02:02:41.803 --> 02:02:46.626]  I mean, by the way, they eat off of Adolf Hitler's silverware reportedly during their Sunday session.
[02:02:46.666 --> 02:02:49.148]  So it's not just a conspiracy theory.
[02:02:49.768 --> 02:02:50.929]  It's not a fraternity.
[02:02:51.009 --> 02:02:58.233]  There's clear indications that they were directly connected to the Bavarian German Illuminati.
[02:02:58.513 --> 02:03:21.629]  Of course, they kneel down and kiss a human skull and are given a new name, and mostly demonic names like Long Devil or Beelzebub or Bale, as they're reborn into this brotherhood of death, which teaches them the secret of Satanism, the royal secret, which is their philosophy, which is carried on in secret, which now we have, again, being promoted in the mainstream by
[02:03:22.049 --> 02:03:26.091]  By pop stars, you know, just promoting Satanism as cool as we can see.
[02:03:26.452 --> 02:03:28.733]  Christianity is completely under assault.
[02:03:29.473 --> 02:03:40.100]  You know, it's fine to criticize and blaspheme and defame Jesus and Christianity, but you can't criticize certain other religions, otherwise bad things will happen to your career.
[02:03:40.520 --> 02:04:00.301]  Katy Perry, by the way, of course, you know, scrubbed a necklace that was considered blasphemous to the Muslims in her, you know, Illuminati-themed Dark Horse, Dark Horse of the Apocalypse music video because Muslims started a petition because she used black magic and destroyed a figure who had an Allah penance, you know, God in Arabic.
[02:04:01.013 --> 02:04:07.776]  So they bow down to that, but of course, it's cool for her to be burning Christians at the stake during her Grammy performance as well.
[02:04:07.837 --> 02:04:16.821]  And, you know, what's interesting, last month the Bohemian Grove happened, another, you know, just an offshoot of this, you know, satanic brotherhood, this invisible empire.
[02:04:16.841 --> 02:04:19.563]  And of course, not a word in any of the mainstream press.
[02:04:19.923 --> 02:04:24.185]  As you know, the Bilderberg Group slowly has been covered a little bit because they can't
[02:04:24.665 --> 02:04:27.447]  It can't cover it up with social media, with shows like yours.
[02:04:27.467 --> 02:04:30.630]  It would be obvious at this point that there is a cover-up.
[02:04:30.650 --> 02:04:35.614]  So, occasionally, the last couple of years, we've seen a little bit in the mainstream about the Bilderberg Group.
[02:04:35.934 --> 02:04:39.758]  It is somewhat easy to dismiss it as, oh, it's just a private meeting.
[02:04:39.798 --> 02:04:42.700]  Don't worry about the fact that we haven't mentioned it for the last 60 years.
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:49.325]  But not a word of the Bohemian Grove, because, well, how do you possibly explain the cremation of care when you see the photos of the video, which you, of course, famously got?
[02:04:49.345 --> 02:04:51.847]  Or Henry Kissinger in drag, bending over.
[02:04:52.688 --> 02:04:53.348]  Doing something.
[02:04:54.009 --> 02:04:58.651]  And I've seen that there, a photo of that hanging on a tree when I was there, while Kissinger was there.
[02:04:59.192 --> 02:05:01.073]  And it was horrifying.
[02:05:01.133 --> 02:05:02.573]  Mark Dice, markdice.com.
[02:05:02.693 --> 02:05:03.174]  Great job.
[02:05:03.194 --> 02:05:04.114]  We'll have you back up soon.
[02:05:04.494 --> 02:05:05.235]  Thank you so much.
[02:05:07.777 --> 02:05:13.725]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:05:13.945 --> 02:05:18.130]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:05:18.511 --> 02:05:23.077]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:05:23.477 --> 02:05:26.079]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:05:26.399 --> 02:05:31.582]  You now know it as Survival Shield True Nascent Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:05:31.843 --> 02:05:38.727]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[02:05:39.227 --> 02:05:43.310]  And the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:05:43.370 --> 02:05:48.153]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:05:48.473 --> 02:05:49.334]  This is innovating.
[02:05:49.614 --> 02:05:56.901]  And the best part is, it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:05:57.081 --> 02:06:01.145]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[02:06:01.345 --> 02:06:06.529]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:06:08.627 --> 02:06:09.708]  In the near future.
[02:06:09.968 --> 02:06:13.609]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:06:13.629 --> 02:06:14.090]  Security alert.
[02:06:14.470 --> 02:06:15.490]  Security alert.
[02:06:15.690 --> 02:06:17.431]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:06:17.691 --> 02:06:18.312]  Analysis.
[02:06:18.592 --> 02:06:19.232]  InfoWars.
[02:06:19.312 --> 02:06:21.253]  Building independent media operations.
[02:06:21.273 --> 02:06:26.256]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:06:26.296 --> 02:06:27.196]  Prime Directive.
[02:06:27.316 --> 02:06:28.717]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[02:06:28.877 --> 02:06:31.638]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:06:31.718 --> 02:06:34.800]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:37.121]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:06:37.261 --> 02:06:38.762]  These people are assaulting us.
[02:06:38.782 --> 02:06:41.123]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:06:41.624 --> 02:06:43.305]  They are never going to stop.
[02:06:43.565 --> 02:06:47.447]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[02:06:47.607 --> 02:06:50.789]  Block free iPhone ads at InfoWars.com.
[02:06:51.190 --> 02:06:53.831]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[02:06:54.552 --> 02:06:55.292]  Imperative.
[02:06:55.552 --> 02:06:57.594]  Destroy Britain's Senate TV.
[02:06:57.614 --> 02:07:01.996]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:07:02.016 --> 02:07:03.617]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[02:07:03.637 --> 02:07:04.358]  You can feel it.
[02:07:07.116 --> 02:07:14.185]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:07:14.285 --> 02:07:16.447]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:07:16.628 --> 02:07:21.734]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:07:21.914 --> 02:07:26.860]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:07:27.060 --> 02:07:30.143]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:07:30.383 --> 02:07:34.247]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:07:34.467 --> 02:07:38.711]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:07:38.792 --> 02:07:48.861]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:07:49.021 --> 02:07:51.544]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[02:07:51.724 --> 02:07:59.771]  And manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:07:59.931 --> 02:08:03.895]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:08:20.900 --> 02:08:23.443]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:23.463 --> 02:08:28.248]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:08:40.869 --> 02:08:42.630]  We are back live ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:43.150 --> 02:08:45.091]  We're here Monday through Friday 11 a.m.
[02:08:45.111 --> 02:08:45.892]  to 2 p.m.
[02:08:45.932 --> 02:08:47.893]  Central and then I return live.
[02:08:47.933 --> 02:08:50.355]  I'll be live this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:08:50.395 --> 02:08:54.278]  Central Standard Time in this studio covering all the important news.
[02:08:54.318 --> 02:09:04.184]  I'll be on the nightly news tonight 7 o'clock Central doing a special report detailing and documenting what I spent 10 minutes on in the last hour.
[02:09:05.405 --> 02:09:06.406]  Getting into the fact that
[02:09:07.486 --> 02:09:09.687]  Al-Qaeda is called IS now, or ISIS.
[02:09:10.027 --> 02:09:11.048]  They're being protected.
[02:09:11.648 --> 02:09:15.529]  They're giving a third of the country of Iraq to them, but they've sort of taken over Kurd areas.
[02:09:17.070 --> 02:09:21.592]  So now they've been bombed, and that lets Obama act like NATO and others aren't funding them.
[02:09:23.132 --> 02:09:31.955]  So again, this is a great example of full-spectrum dominance and how the system controls the drug trade, controls the money laundering, and then busts the little people.
[02:09:33.196 --> 02:09:34.636]  Just like they run the terrorism.
[02:09:34.696 --> 02:09:35.697]  Now, the terrorists are real.
[02:09:36.969 --> 02:09:46.652]  And that threat does go on, but it's way overblown and it's protected and shepherded and allowed to thrive as a pretext for the military-industrial complex.
[02:09:46.712 --> 02:09:53.994]  It was declassified in 1972 in congressional hearings, again in 1997 with the CIA Inspector General.
[02:09:54.054 --> 02:09:57.395]  I watched those hearings live on C-SPAN, played clips of it on the radio that night.
[02:09:58.215 --> 02:09:58.795]  It was huge.
[02:10:00.546 --> 02:10:08.888]  It was on none of the news, but it was on C-SPAN, them admitting, yes, we've been shipping most of the cocaine in for decades, and then we distribute it on the streets, and we're gonna stop now.
[02:10:09.509 --> 02:10:13.650]  And when in Vietnam, they were shipping in most of the opium out of Vietnam, and then they're gonna stop now.
[02:10:13.690 --> 02:10:20.492]  And in Iraq, they're growing the opium and making the troops grow it, and then it gets shipped in, and if you get caught with it, or your kid gets
[02:10:21.352 --> 02:10:21.552]  On it.
[02:10:22.153 --> 02:10:26.776]  Or you get caught with synthetic stuff from your doctor and that you go out because you got back pain.
[02:10:26.796 --> 02:10:27.496]  You're going to go to jail.
[02:10:27.716 --> 02:10:28.677]  That's a disease.
[02:10:29.157 --> 02:10:29.918]  That's abuse.
[02:10:29.958 --> 02:10:31.399]  That's not a reason to put somebody in prison.
[02:10:31.759 --> 02:10:34.561]  But we have the biggest prison population in the world.
[02:10:35.261 --> 02:10:37.123]  Three million people behind bars in any one town.
[02:10:37.143 --> 02:10:38.544]  Another seven million in the system.
[02:10:38.824 --> 02:10:40.025]  That's more than Communist China.
[02:10:41.105 --> 02:10:42.987]  Meanwhile, the border is wide open.
[02:10:43.047 --> 02:10:44.528]  Illegals are pouring in en masse.
[02:10:45.128 --> 02:10:46.929]  And they can be felons and they're released.
[02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:49.031]  It's just crazy town.
[02:10:49.642 --> 02:10:51.843]  And the average cop I know totally agrees with me.
[02:10:51.863 --> 02:10:52.804]  He's totally freaked out.
[02:10:53.084 --> 02:11:03.209]  I've had Travis County prosecutors come to my office, tell me about all the stuff that's going on, how they want decriminalization, how it's the big prisons lobbying for all these drug laws to keep people in the system.
[02:11:03.249 --> 02:11:15.154]  And yeah, you can use drug laws to get criminals that are doing other really bad stuff, robbing people and stuff, but the drug trade keeps the price up and that's what lets the higher level dealers basically profit from all this.
[02:11:15.294 --> 02:11:17.695]  And Jamie Balasia is an amazing guy.
[02:11:17.715 --> 02:11:18.236]  I've known him for
[02:11:19.016 --> 02:11:23.058]  Three or four years, but I've seen his billboards and heard him on the radio.
[02:11:23.118 --> 02:11:36.886]  And if you live in Texas, you know about the DWI dude who fights back against the police state that we have in this country, where they're taking blood without warrants on the side of the highway, all under federal grants.
[02:11:37.626 --> 02:11:39.207]  And this is happening all over the country.
[02:11:39.587 --> 02:11:43.729]  And of course he wrote a book that became a really big seller, breaking all this down.
[02:11:43.749 --> 02:11:45.810]  In fact, we sell it at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:48.831]  But he's with us because he's thrown his hat in the ring.
[02:11:48.891 --> 02:11:58.456]  Even if he doesn't win, he'll inject sanity, and we appreciate that, into the debates that are on TV, into all the radio interviews he'll do.
[02:11:59.416 --> 02:12:19.564]  I mean, it's really exciting to see this type of stuff going on when you get into the libertarian realm, trying to not just get Tea Party people elected, but folks you could call kind of Republican on some issues, Democrat on others, but really just an old-fashioned Texas guy who wants freedom.
[02:12:19.884 --> 02:12:23.466]  So he's a really good guy, and Jamie joins us, DWI dude.
[02:12:24.326 --> 02:12:26.753]  dot com is his main law firm site.
[02:12:26.994 --> 02:12:31.547]  You can find out about his 2014 run for Texas Attorney General there.
[02:12:32.509 --> 02:12:39.632]  And again, it's important for him because he's a smart guy, well-spoken, has the facts, is a former police officer from Austin.
[02:12:39.652 --> 02:12:42.733]  Most of the guys that work for him are former police officers.
[02:12:43.253 --> 02:12:49.935]  And he's one of the most successful law firms in the country defending people from violations of their constitutional rights.
[02:12:50.255 --> 02:12:55.677]  When you pull up to Art Acevedo's, and Art's a nice guy, but still he's doing stuff, getting federal grants I'm against.
[02:12:56.197 --> 02:12:57.638]  Just like when he wants gun control.
[02:12:58.038 --> 02:13:00.379]  And Mr. Belasia is not for that, we'll get his view on that.
[02:13:02.050 --> 02:13:03.011]  It's unconstitutional.
[02:13:03.231 --> 02:13:04.853]  I need to show signs of being impaired.
[02:13:04.873 --> 02:13:06.074]  I need to be driving recklessly.
[02:13:06.394 --> 02:13:09.377]  I don't need to have a breathalyzer shoved in my face.
[02:13:10.137 --> 02:13:12.840]  I mean, that's not America, folks, and it doesn't keep us safe.
[02:13:13.781 --> 02:13:19.125]  And MAD and others are just used to expand the police state, not actually stop the dangerous drunk drivers that are out there.
[02:13:19.366 --> 02:13:20.467]  Now, my rant's done.
[02:13:20.487 --> 02:13:22.969]  I just know some stations join us in the third hour.
[02:13:22.989 --> 02:13:23.689]  DWIDUDE.COM
[02:13:26.952 --> 02:13:30.075]  And he's a criminal justice system for 35 years.
[02:13:30.876 --> 02:13:33.379]  He has a true passion for defending people's legal rights.
[02:13:33.759 --> 02:13:41.427]  Jamie has been able to win the so-called unwinnable cases by bringing more experienced training and desire to the courtroom.
[02:13:42.188 --> 02:13:43.970]  Then the state or any other lawyers can.
[02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:47.873]  He's testified as an expert witness in felony cases and on drug alcohol issues.
[02:13:48.474 --> 02:13:54.759]  He's also assisted other attorneys in DWI cases reduced due to his analysis of the police officer performance.
[02:13:55.100 --> 02:14:00.925]  Jamie truly believes that you shouldn't have to pay for a DWI or criminal conviction for the rest of your life.
[02:14:01.405 --> 02:14:02.246]  And he joins us now.
[02:14:02.527 --> 02:14:15.784]  That's quite a rant, Jamie, but you're here running as the Libertarian candidate for Texas Attorney General, and I think you'd bring a lot of balance to the extreme left that's up there and the extreme good old boy right.
[02:14:16.585 --> 02:14:24.011]  I see a Texas case here where a guy that made pot brownies is facing seven years to more for making pot brownies for his buddies.
[02:14:24.091 --> 02:14:27.294]  I mean, that's not the kind of country I want to live in.
[02:14:27.594 --> 02:14:34.319]  I don't want to live in a country where when somebody drives in with Colorado plates, the state police pull them over because we think they got dope in the car.
[02:14:35.320 --> 02:14:35.981]  I talk to cops.
[02:14:36.041 --> 02:14:42.166]  I say, look, Bank of America, Wells Fargo are on record, Wachovia, laundering hundreds of billions in drug money.
[02:14:42.206 --> 02:14:43.206]  Here's the news article.
[02:14:43.647 --> 02:14:44.648]  Why don't you go after them?
[02:14:45.765 --> 02:14:49.006]  I mean, they're owning the aircraft, running the flights, getting the weapons.
[02:14:49.026 --> 02:14:51.206]  They're like, well, we're not allowed to go after them.
[02:14:51.246 --> 02:15:00.869]  No, we're going to go after a teenager, dumb enough to be driving around with a half ounce of marijuana in their car, and then it wrecks their life, sucks them into the system, modern slavery.
[02:15:01.189 --> 02:15:02.550]  Jamie Balasia, thanks for coming in.
[02:15:02.570 --> 02:15:05.130]  Appreciate it, Alex, and wonderful to be here.
[02:15:05.150 --> 02:15:08.111]  You know, I was thinking about things my dad told me when I was growing up.
[02:15:09.031 --> 02:15:14.493]  And one of the things he really insisted on us living by was you don't kick somebody when they're down.
[02:15:15.512 --> 02:15:19.014]  And when somebody pays the price for something, the slate's clean.
[02:15:19.354 --> 02:15:22.517]  It's time to give them a fresh shot and a fresh chance at something.
[02:15:23.477 --> 02:15:30.141]  I was reading on your TV screen a minute ago, it said slavery still exists, and I was thinking about in the criminal justice system.
[02:15:30.822 --> 02:15:33.804]  You know, we put them in chains, we lock them up in cages.
[02:15:33.824 --> 02:15:36.726]  That sounds an awful lot like the old slavery routine.
[02:15:38.044 --> 02:15:45.051]  One of the things that never fails to amaze me is when you consider the voting patterns of the minorities in our country.
[02:15:45.751 --> 02:15:50.576]  What has the Democratic Party or the Democrat Party done for minorities?
[02:15:51.177 --> 02:15:59.865]  Except in some ways loosely enslave them mentally and psychologically and just repeating the same old thing over and over again.
[02:16:00.725 --> 02:16:03.746]  I was talking to a woman in Dallas.
[02:16:04.047 --> 02:16:13.930]  She's an African-American advocate for civil rights reform, and her son was basically murdered by the Dallas Police Department, if you read the story.
[02:16:14.751 --> 02:16:25.915]  And I asked her on a podcast, I said, why do the minorities insist on repeating to vote for the Democrat candidate in these elections?
[02:16:26.555 --> 02:16:28.056]  What have the Democrats done for you?
[02:16:29.036 --> 02:16:39.242]  And I said, the Libertarian Party, we're for less government, we're for freedom, we're for decriminalizing marijuana so we stop locking up all the young blacks and destroying their futures with a drug conviction.
[02:16:39.943 --> 02:16:54.012]  And the more we talked, by the end of the conversation, she told me that not only was she in support of me for a Texas Attorney General, but she was going to tell all of her friends to go and look at my website and to consider voting for a change from the same old thing.
[02:16:54.872 --> 02:16:56.774]  I told her, I said, you know, the Republicans
[02:16:57.802 --> 02:17:01.845]  All the successful Republicans I know, when I knew them in college, they were all smoking weed.
[02:17:02.346 --> 02:17:03.306]  They didn't get busted.
[02:17:03.627 --> 02:17:04.647]  They didn't get put in jail.
[02:17:04.888 --> 02:17:06.649]  They didn't lose their college financial aid.
[02:17:07.089 --> 02:17:08.350]  They didn't lose their careers.
[02:17:08.991 --> 02:17:11.393]  And look at the man in the White House.
[02:17:12.273 --> 02:17:15.436]  He was hot boxin' all over Hawaii and everywhere else he went.
[02:17:15.936 --> 02:17:17.537]  He was on cocaine, they basically admit.
[02:17:17.958 --> 02:17:19.018]  Yeah, especially at Harvard.
[02:17:19.059 --> 02:17:21.821]  I think that was most of the work he did, not riding on
[02:17:22.702 --> 02:17:23.142]  I don't know.
[02:17:35.629 --> 02:17:54.042]  You know, if these people are sincere about stopping addictive behavior, then why don't we earmark 50-75% of all the forfeiture funds and that they must not go to law enforcement and not to the District Attorney's Office and not to the DEA, but let's put them in job training for people who are in prison.
[02:17:54.463 --> 02:17:59.566]  Let's put them in drug rehab centers to help people instead of locking them up and destroying their future.
[02:17:59.967 --> 02:18:01.768]  Let's give them some training and get them a future.
[02:18:04.389 --> 02:18:16.597]  You tell that to the to the narcotics officers that 50 to 75% of the money they seize is not going back into their pockets and not allowing them to drive fancy cars that they seize, they'll stop doing that type of work.
[02:18:17.818 --> 02:18:19.559]  And that's why they don't go after the big boys.
[02:18:20.820 --> 02:18:21.760]  Talk to your local
[02:18:23.883 --> 02:18:30.365]  You know, so-called drug dealers here in Austin and find out how many of them can go down to cocaine and fly up a plane of drugs.
[02:18:30.825 --> 02:18:33.526]  How many of them can go to the Middle East and bring back heroin?
[02:18:34.086 --> 02:18:34.526]  None of them.
[02:18:34.986 --> 02:18:38.527]  They can't go into Mexico and bring back boatloads of pot.
[02:18:39.347 --> 02:18:41.688]  They're not the ones that are bringing the drugs into this country.
[02:18:42.528 --> 02:18:45.289]  It's the higher interests like you talk about.
[02:18:46.198 --> 02:18:50.780]  And it's so transparent, and now all the polls show across the country, America is turning against the drug war.
[02:18:51.260 --> 02:18:51.841]  It's over.
[02:18:52.641 --> 02:18:54.762]  But the establishment's still trying to push it.
[02:18:54.982 --> 02:18:56.082]  Where do you see all this going?
[02:18:56.763 --> 02:19:10.129]  Well, as a police officer, if I pull over 15 cars for a traffic violation, which I can make one up or I can just wait, anybody's going to violate a traffic law if you fall on more than a couple miles.
[02:19:10.931 --> 02:19:16.432]  Be it weaving in your lane, or touching the line, or failing to signal, or defective light.
[02:19:16.972 --> 02:19:18.892]  Non-dangerous activity.
[02:19:19.472 --> 02:19:20.973]  Like you talk about the reckless driving.
[02:19:21.633 --> 02:19:22.733]  Non-reckless driving.
[02:19:23.253 --> 02:19:27.654]  So I pull over 15 cars in a row, and on all 15 I tell them, how do you smell marijuana?
[02:19:27.674 --> 02:19:28.574]  I want to search your car.
[02:19:29.374 --> 02:19:32.075]  By law, I'm getting in your car if I smelled marijuana.
[02:19:33.275 --> 02:19:36.955]  Well, I search 15 cars and I find one blunt in one car.
[02:19:37.555 --> 02:19:39.036]  Well, I don't write 15 reports.
[02:19:39.396 --> 02:19:40.236]  I write one report.
[02:19:41.095 --> 02:19:47.719]  Later on, over a year period, you look at my reports, it's like, this Bellagio guy, he, he, every time he smells marijuana, he finds something.
[02:19:48.099 --> 02:19:49.480]  He's 100% accurate.
[02:19:49.861 --> 02:19:50.901]  Well, actually, I'm not.
[02:19:51.682 --> 02:19:56.125]  I'm, I'm well under 10% on, but that's my excuse to search a car.
[02:19:56.145 --> 02:19:57.505]  Jamie Bellagio, stay with us.
[02:19:57.726 --> 02:20:01.928]  And that's what irritates me, because, you know, I don't have this stuff in my car or whatever, and they were wanting to search.
[02:20:02.208 --> 02:20:07.071]  I'm like, hey, this is supposed to be a free country, plus the government ships in the hard drugs, it's all a fraud.

[02:21:06.680 --> 02:21:13.728]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:21:13.888 --> 02:21:16.049]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:21:16.229 --> 02:21:21.412]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:21:21.552 --> 02:21:26.635]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:21:26.735 --> 02:21:29.817]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:21:30.117 --> 02:21:34.019]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:21:34.219 --> 02:21:38.502]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:21:38.582 --> 02:21:48.667]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:21:48.867 --> 02:21:53.209]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.

[02:22:11.887 --> 02:22:12.187]  Answer.

[02:23:37.175 --> 02:23:38.436]  You've heard about bunkers.
[02:23:38.636 --> 02:23:41.196]  But surviving is not recreation.
[02:23:41.396 --> 02:23:43.917]  And man wasn't made to live underground.

[02:24:23.439 --> 02:24:25.520]  Jamie Balasia is our guest in the studio.
[02:24:25.540 --> 02:24:27.922]  I hope he'll come in every few months, because he's a great interview.
[02:24:28.382 --> 02:24:32.545]  And we can have him back soon to take your calls on DWI law across the country.
[02:24:32.565 --> 02:24:37.148]  We'll talk about his book, too, before he leaves us, DWID.com.
[02:24:37.849 --> 02:24:43.052]  And there's this argument that, well, we're going to stop crime by getting people that use drugs off the streets.
[02:24:44.253 --> 02:24:49.176]  I mean, I know you talk a lot about that, but we know what happened in alcohol prohibition, and we know what's happened in drug prohibition.
[02:24:49.236 --> 02:24:53.119]  What is the history of the drug war that's been going on since Richard Milhouse Nixon?
[02:24:53.760 --> 02:24:59.315]  Well, you know, basically 50 years, but for the last 40 years... You're right, it's been turned up on high since next Sunday, yeah.
[02:24:59.475 --> 02:25:01.120]  It has really cranked up, though.
[02:25:02.355 --> 02:25:03.656]  What a way to control your people.
[02:25:03.716 --> 02:25:05.817]  What a way to put fear in the community.
[02:25:08.178 --> 02:25:17.883]  When you talk to the people that are anti-marijuana, and you don't have to be pro-marijuana to understand the damage that the war on drugs has done to our country.
[02:25:18.404 --> 02:25:25.808]  It's empowered the police to violate the Constitution, walk all over your search and seizure rights.
[02:25:26.923 --> 02:25:27.203]  I don't
[02:25:44.056 --> 02:25:54.118]  Is stopping the people who are making it home safely except for a defective taillight or making a lane change with no other vehicles around it, is that the kind of driver we want?
[02:25:54.578 --> 02:25:59.139]  Locked up, convicted, pumping money into the system.
[02:25:59.479 --> 02:26:05.000]  You know, in Texas, so many of our cities, the DPS lab tests the blood.
[02:26:05.680 --> 02:26:11.021]  If you're convicted based on the lab's testimony, then you pay a surcharge to DPS.
[02:26:12.085 --> 02:26:14.246]  It's a huge conflict of interest.
[02:26:15.406 --> 02:26:23.208]  The labs are hiding information from us and the courts won't force them to open up their books to us so we can see whether or not they're following the protocols properly.
[02:26:25.268 --> 02:26:30.809]  It's just real extreme being a police officer knowing how we used to patrol the streets in Austin.
[02:26:31.269 --> 02:26:33.370]  I actually thought that I was supposed to protect and to serve.
[02:26:34.130 --> 02:26:37.451]  And I know we have great cops out here today still.
[02:26:38.393 --> 02:26:41.655]  But the rules they operate under have completely changed.
[02:27:09.133 --> 02:27:15.676]  Arizona recently, the VA out there ruled that they were going to allow the veterans to use medicinal marijuana.
[02:27:17.237 --> 02:27:20.819]  Before that ruling, they would rather have a veteran on Oxycontin.
[02:27:21.638 --> 02:27:23.638]  than on medical marijuana at his house.
[02:27:23.758 --> 02:27:25.899]  For folks who don't know, that is synthetic heroin.
[02:27:26.239 --> 02:27:27.059]  Yes, exactly.
[02:27:27.679 --> 02:27:29.780]  And we know where the real heroin's coming into our country from.
[02:27:29.800 --> 02:27:32.820]  It's straight out of Afghanistan.
[02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:34.360]  Who controls Afghanistan?
[02:27:34.380 --> 02:27:35.961]  Supposedly, we do.
[02:27:36.001 --> 02:27:48.503]  For those who don't know, there is government studies, there's literally hundreds of them, I know you know about this, that marijuana for medical uses for depression, glaucoma, cancer where you can't eat, it really is a miracle plant drug.
[02:27:48.903 --> 02:27:52.104]  Epilepsy in kids, stop seizures almost instantly.
[02:27:52.684 --> 02:27:55.706]  Why are they denying a mother the right to pick the medicine for her kid?
[02:27:57.226 --> 02:28:12.932]  The opponents in these races, the Democrat and Republicans, they cannot explain to the voters why they won't let our veterans using medicinal marijuana, why they won't let our mothers give their kids medicine, THC, that will stop seizures.
[02:28:13.852 --> 02:28:16.913]  I'd like to see them, you know, stand up and support their position on that.
[02:28:16.933 --> 02:28:30.498]  Because if we're just talking about medicinal, and we're making a strong push in Texas in this next legislature to get that accomplished, there's no good explanation for why we're refusing to let people have access to medicine.
[02:28:31.232 --> 02:28:36.314]  Now, they'll tell you, well, in California, in Colorado, everybody says they've got a migraine so they need to smoke some weed.
[02:28:36.835 --> 02:28:38.375]  Well, you're always going to have some abuses.
[02:28:39.296 --> 02:28:46.739]  Yeah, just because there's a bunch of idiots that are going to smoke pot ten times a day and lay around in the basement, they're going to end up doing something like that anyways.
[02:28:47.239 --> 02:28:51.321]  Everybody else shouldn't live in a police state because other people are morons.
[02:28:51.661 --> 02:28:59.903]  And if you take away marijuana by, if you could snap your fingers and it all goes away, those kind of people, the ones that are going to lay around and be bums, they're going to be bums with something else.
[02:29:00.563 --> 02:29:03.464]  Either alcohol, prescription medicine, just whatever.
[02:29:03.484 --> 02:29:07.025]  I know a lot of executives that use marijuana to relax.
[02:29:07.165 --> 02:29:10.346]  At the end of the day, they do a great job and they're not getting drunk.
[02:29:10.746 --> 02:29:15.547]  And I think overall, marijuana probably is better than alcohol from the studies I've seen for your body.
[02:29:15.987 --> 02:29:16.867]  It does less damage.
[02:29:16.887 --> 02:29:18.208]  It actually may do some good.
[02:29:19.088 --> 02:29:21.770]  I mean, a lot of executives use it to unwind.
[02:29:21.790 --> 02:29:26.572]  I mean, meanwhile, a judge is putting them in jail for it, when the judge is having six cocktails.
[02:29:26.933 --> 02:29:34.497]  And when I was a policeman, would I rather get a call of a couple guys smoking a joint at the park, or three guys getting drunk and fist fighting outside of a bar?
[02:29:35.238 --> 02:29:36.859]  See, the marijuana guys were never violent.
[02:29:37.079 --> 02:29:38.419]  They were easy to handle.
[02:29:38.860 --> 02:29:41.461]  Now, you mix marijuana and alcohol, it's the same as alcohol.
[02:29:44.583 --> 02:29:47.607]  Dangerous to the community when they're driving, things like that.
[02:29:48.027 --> 02:29:49.309]  Let's talk about that when we come back.
[02:29:49.349 --> 02:29:56.357]  He's running for Attorney General in Texas, DWIDUDE.COM, DWIDUDE.COM, Jamie Balasia.
[02:29:56.718 --> 02:29:59.701]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:00.642 --> 02:30:03.326]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:07.429 --> 02:30:10.271]  This is Leanne McAdoo for InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:30:10.551 --> 02:30:16.454]  I'm here with Dr. Edward Group, Master Herbologist and Chief Formulator behind the InfoWarsLife products.
[02:30:16.654 --> 02:30:21.077]  Dr. Group, what have you been hearing from women who've started taking Super Female Vitality?
[02:30:21.177 --> 02:30:27.741]  You know, we've heard the reviews and feedback from Super Male Vitality from emails to even excited callers on the radio.
[02:30:28.041 --> 02:30:29.922]  Now, the answer for women is here.

[02:30:41.731 --> 02:30:43.713]  I'm so glad that you guys made this for women.
[02:30:43.753 --> 02:30:49.357]  When he brought me home, the bottle of Super Female, I had tons of energy, tons of motivation, a lot of drive.
[02:30:49.477 --> 02:30:51.118]  My husband thinks I've been in a better mood.
[02:30:51.299 --> 02:30:53.180]  Our relationship, all I can say is, it's a lot better now.
[02:30:53.440 --> 02:30:57.607]  I've just started taking super female vitality from InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:31:07.836 --> 02:31:13.962]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[02:31:13.982 --> 02:31:17.306]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[02:31:17.406 --> 02:31:19.027]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!

[02:31:25.414 --> 02:31:31.300]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote homeless security by sticking our hands down on the fence on the streets?
[02:31:31.460 --> 02:31:35.222]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.

[02:31:38.323 --> 02:31:46.486]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[02:31:46.767 --> 02:31:48.807]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[02:31:48.847 --> 02:31:49.888]  It's a war against the truth.
[02:31:50.268 --> 02:31:59.020]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.TV and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[02:32:07.711 --> 02:32:11.234]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:32:11.374 --> 02:32:15.357]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:32:15.657 --> 02:32:17.119]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:32:17.439 --> 02:32:22.463]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.

[02:33:28.205 --> 02:33:36.727]  David Knight did an incredible interview last night on the Nightly News with a former SEAL-turned-author who predicted vet demonization and border collapse.
[02:33:37.147 --> 02:33:39.568]  That interview is up on InfoWars.com on the show ends.
[02:33:39.848 --> 02:33:41.748]  People should share that on Facebook, Twitter, you name it.
[02:33:42.068 --> 02:33:43.349]  Plus, I want to get the guy on.
[02:33:43.789 --> 02:33:47.430]  Not only is he a patriot and really smart, he's a dead ringer for Ron Burgundy.
[02:33:48.590 --> 02:33:50.670]  I mean, if that isn't Ron Burgundy, I don't know what.
[02:33:51.291 --> 02:33:52.691]  Will Ferrell, I guess, is that guy's name?
[02:33:53.527 --> 02:33:54.507]  Get the name right of that actor?
[02:33:55.548 --> 02:33:58.569]  Ron Burgundy was on InfoWars Nightly News last night.
[02:33:59.630 --> 02:34:01.151]  Anyways, uh, hilarious.
[02:34:01.971 --> 02:34:03.432]  Uh, but it's a serious topic, actually.
[02:34:03.452 --> 02:34:10.235]  We had that former Marine Corps colonel, Ron Starr, you name it, just in Iraq a few years ago, in Fallujah, you name it, on this week.
[02:34:11.956 --> 02:34:15.298]  Uh, breaking down the entire situation.
[02:34:16.249 --> 02:34:19.070]  And the fact that the government's preparing for war against us.
[02:34:19.150 --> 02:34:27.634]  And look, Austin, Texas, where I live, and we're all over the world, but syndicated here in the U.S., 3 million listeners a day just terrestrially on AM and FM.
[02:34:28.355 --> 02:34:29.275]  But we're on all over the world.
[02:34:29.355 --> 02:34:33.017]  But I've been to a lot of third world countries, and the cops bug their eyes out of people.
[02:34:33.057 --> 02:34:34.137]  They want to menace people.
[02:34:34.598 --> 02:34:37.459]  It's a North Korean or Guatemalan type feel.
[02:34:39.127 --> 02:34:40.608]  Growing up, the cops weren't like that.
[02:34:40.648 --> 02:34:44.251]  They were, you know, really friendly guys that, you know, at least I grew up in Dallas, who were nice.
[02:34:44.271 --> 02:34:46.012]  They were tough guys, but they were friendly to everybody.
[02:34:46.993 --> 02:34:57.561]  I've been in the National Park last year down there shooting a documentary on the border, and we would see the armed version of the park ranger.
[02:34:58.820 --> 02:35:05.001]  And we wave at people, and there was this one big guy, big black guy, he'd bug his eyes out at people and actually bow up.
[02:35:05.382 --> 02:35:09.282]  So I saw him three times around the Chizos Lodge where we were staying.
[02:35:10.263 --> 02:35:14.544]  Finally, I pulled over when he was walking around this parking lot bugging out, and I said, hey, how you doing?
[02:35:14.844 --> 02:35:16.004]  Rob Doodle was there, and the guy went, grr!
[02:35:16.024 --> 02:35:20.505]  And, I mean, let me tell you something, they shouldn't be hiring people that when someone's waving at them go,
[02:35:22.008 --> 02:35:26.010]  Probably didn't have that high of an IQ, literally thinks everyone's a terrorist.
[02:35:26.430 --> 02:35:30.111]  And I was talking to Jamie Balasia, our guest in here, who's running for Texas Attorney General.
[02:35:30.151 --> 02:35:31.652]  He is the candidate for Libertarians.
[02:35:32.032 --> 02:35:39.355]  Get behind him at DWIDUDE.com if you're a Libertarian and, you know, don't like this whole phony drug war and sick of the Democrats and Republicans.
[02:35:40.416 --> 02:35:45.380]  And he's a UT fan, obviously, therefore people go on his website and think it's devil stuff when he's doing the horn thing.
[02:35:45.700 --> 02:35:48.182]  No, it was the devil thing when Bush would do it, not when he does it.
[02:35:48.482 --> 02:35:54.306]  The point is, it means longhorn, is that we're talking about Austin being an oasis and it's got problems.
[02:35:54.726 --> 02:36:04.833]  But you go to New York, Chicago, I mean, I've been in New York where the cops are wearing, and I've got video of this, I've shown it, they're hats sideways, huge pot bellies with cigars
[02:36:06.014 --> 02:36:12.340]  And like telling an ABC cameraman you can't film on a sidewalk and then beating him up, or coming over to me and going, look, you want to get hurt.
[02:36:12.741 --> 02:36:19.127]  That's in my police state film that I made, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State, three hour film.
[02:36:20.027 --> 02:36:23.050]  Over and over again, cops saying you're nothing, you're scum, I'll crush you.
[02:36:23.130 --> 02:36:27.194]  I mean, how would someone want to live in a country like that, worse than third world nations?
[02:36:27.695 --> 02:36:30.618]  And how would someone want their kids to grow up if you were a cop?
[02:36:31.380 --> 02:36:36.645]  It's like that cop out in LA whose son didn't do anything and they beat him to death over 14 minutes as he begged for daddy.
[02:36:37.426 --> 02:36:43.048]  See, and that's a cop, retired, honorably retired, whose son got killed by crazy cops, who got off.
[02:36:43.908 --> 02:36:45.949]  And you look at those cops, they had a whole history of this.
[02:36:45.969 --> 02:36:53.532]  Because there's a certain type of wimp out there who wants to be tough and then thinks beating people up, you know, eight to one is tough.
[02:36:53.572 --> 02:36:54.172]  No, that's not tough.
[02:36:54.372 --> 02:36:56.113]  You know, Jamie, you're here to talk and I'm ranting.
[02:36:56.393 --> 02:37:01.175]  You got me going, ranting about San Antonio, how they will bust your chops in a second.
[02:37:01.575 --> 02:37:04.676]  That student with witnesses did nothing, so the cop gunned him down.
[02:37:05.056 --> 02:37:05.376]  Turned out he...
[02:37:06.977 --> 02:37:08.218]  Kicked off five departments?
[02:37:09.319 --> 02:37:16.686]  I mean, that's why it is an oasis, because the cops actually want to be liked by the community, want people to be friendly, and are pretty professional.
[02:37:16.906 --> 02:37:19.188]  I know you sue them all the time, and Austin's got big problems.
[02:37:19.768 --> 02:37:24.372]  But I am saying, Austin is an oasis, why can't we have that other places?
[02:37:24.692 --> 02:37:30.858]  What is the Austin cop culture, that if you were Attorney General, we could try to expand statewide, nationwide?
[02:37:31.650 --> 02:37:39.613]  Well, one thing, I went to the Attorney General website to see just what the Attorney General of Texas office provides for the citizens' protection against police.
[02:37:40.273 --> 02:37:48.836]  And it says, oh, if you feel like you've been brutalized, your civil rights have been violated, contact your local police department or your mayor, and they'll take care of you.
[02:37:49.376 --> 02:37:52.057]  Well, what if your police department doesn't take care of business?
[02:37:52.157 --> 02:37:53.698]  And in Austin, they pretty much do.
[02:37:53.738 --> 02:37:56.539]  The Internal Affairs here will do a thorough investigation.
[02:37:57.423 --> 02:38:15.015]  But in San Antonio, Dallas, Houston, El Paso, you'll get your head split and then you're going down to complain and there's no video evidence, there's no audio taping of anything, it's your word, the guy who's been arrested, beaten up, probably convicted now with a court-appointed lawyer.
[02:38:15.035 --> 02:38:19.178]  Well that's it, they don't just beat you up, they then charge you with assaulting them on top of it.
[02:38:20.538 --> 02:38:21.518]  I'm a God-fearing guy.
[02:38:21.999 --> 02:38:25.640]  Lying about people, destroying their lives, that's coming back on you.
[02:38:25.720 --> 02:38:30.281]  I mean, I get creepy chills just thinking about bearing false witness.
[02:38:31.402 --> 02:38:33.663]  What's wrong with me that I can't lie about people?
[02:38:34.063 --> 02:38:39.985]  There's a culture amongst police departments now in Texas, and my friends across the nation say it's there as well.
[02:38:40.925 --> 02:38:43.686]  See, the war on drugs has contributed greatly to this, too.
[02:38:43.766 --> 02:38:49.689]  It's us against them all of a sudden, and the citizens are just thrown in with the, we're not the police, so we're the bad guys.
[02:38:50.089 --> 02:38:56.491]  They pull us all over, they search us all illegally, they ask us questions about where we're going, what we're doing, where we've been.
[02:38:56.511 --> 02:38:57.892]  That's none of their business.
[02:38:58.152 --> 02:38:59.352]  They're to protect and to serve.
[02:38:59.372 --> 02:39:02.674]  They need to do their job with that kind of an attitude.
[02:39:03.796 --> 02:39:06.118]  Because I get mad when they say, where you going, where you been?
[02:39:06.459 --> 02:39:08.560]  And the cop's looking right at me and knows full well who I am.
[02:39:09.221 --> 02:39:11.443]  And knows full well there's no ticket for like 10 years.
[02:39:12.083 --> 02:39:17.148]  Well, drive from here to Georgetown and look at every black and Hispanic that's pulled over on the side of the highway.
[02:39:17.468 --> 02:39:20.691]  They're all of their properties being taken out of their cars repeatedly.
[02:39:20.951 --> 02:39:21.411]  I see that.
[02:39:21.431 --> 02:39:23.873]  And I notice it's blacks and Hispanics, not just whites doing it.
[02:39:24.134 --> 02:39:26.516]  Is the word out that minorities are who you can pull over?
[02:39:27.196 --> 02:39:28.817]  Yeah, who's going to listen to them when they complain?
[02:39:29.397 --> 02:39:47.385]  I think the Attorney General's Office ought to have some kind of a database so when police officers have a history of being complained on for being rude, for violating the Constitution, for brutalizing people, there has to be some kind of a database who can identify that behavior and put a stop to it when the police departments won't do that.
[02:39:48.085 --> 02:39:50.086]  And currently, there's no database.
[02:39:50.106 --> 02:39:51.047]  We need a cop help!
[02:39:51.786 --> 02:39:52.246]  Well, we do.
[02:39:53.166 --> 02:39:57.668]  You know, there's CopBlock, I think is the name of one website.
[02:39:58.128 --> 02:40:09.451]  Well, also, a lot of people, though, that go after the police, and I used to be in this camp to a certain extent as well, because, you know, I'm 22 years old, trying to do a video report, and a cop comes over and says, you can't film, and I'm 200 yards from the checkpoint, and I know my rights.
[02:40:09.691 --> 02:40:10.311]  I get upset.
[02:40:11.334 --> 02:40:12.415]  Now I get the psychology.
[02:40:12.995 --> 02:40:18.380]  If I'm just mean and attack them and yell at them, then that puts them into their gang mentality and compacts them.
[02:40:18.720 --> 02:40:28.809]  What we need is community citizen policing of the police, and vice versa, to stand up for good cops, to stand up against bad ones, and stand up for other good groups of cops to go after the bad cops.
[02:40:29.109 --> 02:40:32.812]  Instead, the system tends to protect the bad cops at the expense of the good cops.
[02:40:33.072 --> 02:40:39.538]  And so I think it's key to not just yell at us, because a lot of those cop watch groups, I'm not saying that group, they really are anti-police.
[02:40:39.918 --> 02:40:43.361]  And I think it feeds into the us against them mentality.
[02:40:43.381 --> 02:40:44.382]  How do we bypass that?
[02:40:44.722 --> 02:40:56.393]  I think if you require body cameras on every police officer in the state of Texas, and it's mandatory, you record every police citizen encounter, the police aren't going to be jerks to you, and you're probably not going to be a jerk to them.
[02:40:56.973 --> 02:41:00.496]  Neither one of you can make a false accusation, because we've got video documentation.
[02:41:01.357 --> 02:41:03.178]  That would shut down problems.
[02:41:03.598 --> 02:41:08.579]  There was a department that had their officers, 100% of them wore body mics for a year.
[02:41:08.619 --> 02:41:09.580]  That was in California.
[02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:14.261]  Arrest went down 44% and police brutality complaints went down 88%.
[02:41:14.721 --> 02:41:17.082]  Because those two things go hand in hand.
[02:41:17.842 --> 02:41:22.328]  If you're being watched, if you're working the cash register, you're not going to steal if they're videotaping you.
[02:41:22.648 --> 02:41:24.290]  What are they doing to all the casinos in Vegas?
[02:41:24.891 --> 02:41:26.293]  They've got those video cameras on them.
[02:41:26.333 --> 02:41:27.714]  And people say, hey Alex, that's Big Brother.
[02:41:27.754 --> 02:41:33.441]  No, if you're individually with a camera or a mic, and it's individuals, decompartmentalized, that's great!
[02:41:34.122 --> 02:41:35.703]  And it creates a very polite society.
[02:41:35.723 --> 02:41:41.167]  It's not the NSA saying they're not doing it, and then listening to private calls, or looking into your house.
[02:41:41.467 --> 02:41:42.688]  That's a violation of privacy.
[02:41:42.868 --> 02:41:46.210]  There's no perception, you know this as a lawyer, of privacy out in the open.
[02:41:46.550 --> 02:42:01.100]  And so, absolutely, now the computing space, the storage space is so cheap, they have those little clip cameras that are even almost HD now, that'll record an 8-hour shift, every day, it's downloaded, boom, and, but let me tell you, you're not going to see problems then.
[02:42:01.380 --> 02:42:03.943]  Well, I've got the InfoWars video camera in my car.
[02:42:04.243 --> 02:42:04.823]  Oh, that's awesome.
[02:42:04.843 --> 02:42:05.904]  We saw the dash cam yesterday.
[02:42:05.924 --> 02:42:09.148]  Yeah, I bought four of them and sent them to some of my friends and they went nuts.
[02:42:09.188 --> 02:42:09.728]  They love them.
[02:42:10.069 --> 02:42:12.171]  It protects us and it keeps us in check.
[02:42:12.591 --> 02:42:16.955]  I'm not going to drive 150 miles an hour on 130 when I've got your camera recording me.
[02:42:17.416 --> 02:42:20.279]  You know, I don't like recording the citizens.
[02:42:21.513 --> 02:42:22.093]  Cart blunt.
[02:42:22.533 --> 02:42:23.554]  But I do like... Oh no, I agree.
[02:42:23.574 --> 02:42:25.174]  We don't need cameras all over the street corners.
[02:42:25.214 --> 02:42:29.815]  I'm saying individually citizens, individually police, whoever, that protects you.
[02:42:30.036 --> 02:42:31.776]  It protects the cops, it protects the citizen.
[02:42:32.536 --> 02:42:33.377]  It stops abuse.
[02:42:33.697 --> 02:42:34.097]  Period.
[02:42:34.617 --> 02:42:36.257]  Well, the statistics show it, like you said.
[02:42:36.277 --> 02:42:36.437]  Right.
[02:42:36.517 --> 02:42:37.478]  There's no argument against it.
[02:42:37.498 --> 02:42:42.039]  Because you talked about pulling 15 people over as a cop to find the one person with marijuana.
[02:42:42.439 --> 02:42:44.880]  That's going to stop when there's, you know, 10 of those on there.
[02:42:45.140 --> 02:42:53.668]  That's right, because if an officer makes that kind of a boast in court, then I can go pull all of his past videos and research them.
[02:42:54.469 --> 02:42:55.991]  That's going to stop perjury as well.
[02:42:56.491 --> 02:42:56.872]  There it is.
[02:42:56.892 --> 02:42:57.752]  There's London Guardian.
[02:42:57.792 --> 02:43:01.136]  California police use of body cameras cuts violence and complaints.
[02:43:03.224 --> 02:43:04.725]  Well, they say the proof's in the pudding.
[02:43:04.745 --> 02:43:05.806]  There's the pudding right there.
[02:43:06.366 --> 02:43:07.627]  Why isn't Austin doing this?
[02:43:08.368 --> 02:43:08.868]  Just do it!
[02:43:10.209 --> 02:43:20.918]  They can put a $25 surcharge on people who get convictions and let that money fund that program.
[02:43:21.739 --> 02:43:23.901]  Let the people who are being convicted fund the program.
[02:43:24.721 --> 02:43:30.286]  Sooner or later, the circle will go around where it will stop incorrect and illegal arrests.
[02:43:31.578 --> 02:43:32.318]  Well, I've been ranting.
[02:43:32.338 --> 02:43:33.619]  What are the other points you want to get to?
[02:43:33.659 --> 02:43:36.800]  What would you do on the Second Amendment if you were Texas Attorney General?
[02:43:38.900 --> 02:43:44.082]  You know, I'm in the works right now trying to get my permit through DPS to carry a concealed weapon.
[02:43:44.402 --> 02:43:45.482]  Why am I having to do that?
[02:43:46.103 --> 02:43:46.883]  Why should I do it?
[02:43:47.123 --> 02:43:53.665]  I'm only doing it to go through the process so I can understand, you know, how they're restricting us.
[02:43:53.885 --> 02:43:59.967]  And they're holding me up and giving me a double secret probation check, I guess because I am who I am.
[02:44:00.725 --> 02:44:04.106]  Because you're a cop without a criminal record, a retired police officer and a famous lawyer.
[02:44:05.086 --> 02:44:09.027]  And they know that I'm always fighting DPS in court over various issues.
[02:44:10.687 --> 02:44:14.028]  Since when did the Constitution become negotiable, is what I don't understand.
[02:44:14.768 --> 02:44:19.109]  As a police officer, the first thing I did was took an oath to protect and defend the Constitution.
[02:44:19.549 --> 02:44:23.930]  Then I dealt with other issues, which is worse.
[02:44:25.010 --> 02:44:26.951]  A person smoking some marijuana,
[02:44:29.005 --> 02:44:31.147]  Or a police officer violating the Constitution?
[02:44:31.668 --> 02:44:33.730]  Or are government officials violating the Constitution?
[02:44:34.270 --> 02:44:39.356]  I think the Constitution overrides almost every other crime, unless it's a serious violent crime.
[02:44:40.997 --> 02:44:45.021]  Yet how many times do we see anyone brought to bear for violating constitutional rights?
[02:44:45.962 --> 02:44:56.046]  And as a practicing criminal defense attorney who does a lot of trials, you would not believe how much perjury is committed in those courtrooms by the police officers.
[02:44:56.326 --> 02:44:58.507]  It's encouraged by some prosecutors.
[02:44:58.947 --> 02:45:00.888]  I won't say most, but I'll say a lot of them.
[02:45:01.848 --> 02:45:03.109]  And the judges tolerate it.
[02:45:03.949 --> 02:45:04.549]  Well, I'll tell you.
[02:45:04.569 --> 02:45:13.053]  I mean, I can't tell you how many times growing up in Northeast Texas that driving in Deep East Texas, that's where they famously just take the wallet money from old ladies and stuff.
[02:45:14.013 --> 02:45:19.757]  Where they'd say, I mean, I'd have speedometer on at 65 and they'd pull me over, or at 60 they'd go, you were going 75.
[02:45:21.138 --> 02:45:29.825]  And I'd say, it was state police and regular police a couple times, they'd say, no, no, I've got it all back here in the car, you are, don't argue with me, sign the ticket.
[02:45:30.485 --> 02:45:35.069]  And I knew full well when I drove by the cop, there's cops every five miles, that I had it on the
[02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:37.561]  And they will not let you look at it.
[02:45:37.761 --> 02:45:39.302]  And I said, I want to go look at it.
[02:45:39.342 --> 02:45:40.562]  And they said, listen, you want to go to jail?
[02:45:41.243 --> 02:45:42.303]  Just sign the damn ticket.
[02:45:42.804 --> 02:45:45.665]  And they were looking right at me both times, lying.
[02:45:45.685 --> 02:45:46.706]  They just wanted to write tickets.
[02:45:46.846 --> 02:45:53.250]  But I can tell you, when I was a police officer, I could lock my radar in at 75 and then pull over every car and go, yeah, come back and look.
[02:45:54.656 --> 02:45:55.477]  So what does that really mean?
[02:45:55.957 --> 02:45:57.878]  I mean, I just lock the screen.
[02:45:58.338 --> 02:46:00.340]  But I mean, how do they get people that'll do that?
[02:46:00.480 --> 02:46:00.720]  Why?
[02:46:00.840 --> 02:46:01.781]  It's just so corrupt.
[02:46:02.581 --> 02:46:03.622]  It's a culture.
[02:46:03.922 --> 02:46:07.544]  There's an extreme us-against-them attitude.
[02:46:08.345 --> 02:46:09.786]  And I understand how it happens.
[02:46:11.647 --> 02:46:18.951]  When you work in, like, I guess if you're in Chicago and you work in an area where you might not, you know, everybody hates your guts, but why do they hate your guts?
[02:46:19.751 --> 02:46:21.693]  Because you're constantly at odds with them.
[02:46:21.733 --> 02:46:32.058]  You're constantly arresting their friends and their family members for possession of marijuana or jaywalking or, you know, there's crime, there's crime, but you and I want to be protected.
[02:46:32.078 --> 02:46:37.101]  It's like the Lago Vista doctor's wife, with no criminal record, arrested in front of her kids for not wearing a seatbelt.
[02:46:37.421 --> 02:46:42.584]  I mean, that police officer should have had his badge taken away and be banned forever from being a police officer.
[02:46:42.604 --> 02:46:46.367]  Did you see the video that we posted that Drudge picked up that became a big national news story today?
[02:46:46.687 --> 02:46:52.391]  Where the New Jersey cop, like Deputy Chief, says, I don't have to follow the Constitution, Obama doesn't.
[02:46:52.751 --> 02:46:54.052]  Yeah, I watched that yesterday.
[02:46:54.172 --> 02:46:54.912]  What a joke.
[02:46:55.692 --> 02:47:04.596]  But then again, he was making a pretty good point there about when our top elected officials constantly violate the Constitution.
[02:47:05.016 --> 02:47:07.057]  Well, what is the value of that piece of paper anymore?
[02:47:07.617 --> 02:47:09.057]  I think it's more than a piece of paper.
[02:47:09.438 --> 02:47:10.118]  And I think that
[02:47:10.818 --> 02:47:22.368]  If the American citizens would demand that the police, the courts, and our public officials would honor the Constitution, we'd have a lot, we'd go back to the old days that you were talking about.
[02:47:22.668 --> 02:47:27.933]  Well, let's talk about when you were an Austin cop, because I remember growing up, and I wasn't a big troublemaker, but I got in fights and stuff.
[02:47:28.733 --> 02:47:37.040]  If the police pulled us over and we had a 12-pack of beer and there was like three guys and three girls in the car, they would just dump it out or take it.
[02:47:39.144 --> 02:47:41.345]  Because nobody was obviously impaired.
[02:47:41.365 --> 02:47:41.925]  How many beers you had?
[02:47:41.945 --> 02:47:43.206]  You had one or two beers, we're going to pour them out.
[02:47:43.846 --> 02:47:45.427]  They didn't want to just take us to jail.
[02:47:45.507 --> 02:47:47.668]  Now, that, I'm told, never happens.
[02:47:47.968 --> 02:47:50.470]  The rites of passage have now become a criminal record.
[02:47:51.130 --> 02:47:51.330]  Right.
[02:47:51.570 --> 02:47:52.911]  If I liked the beer, I'd take it.
[02:47:53.131 --> 02:47:54.352]  If I didn't, you'd pour it out.
[02:47:54.732 --> 02:47:55.632]  Now they bust you.
[02:47:56.713 --> 02:47:57.913]  You lose your driver's license.
[02:47:58.174 --> 02:48:01.935]  You get an alcohol-related incident on your criminal history that you can never get rid of.
[02:48:04.137 --> 02:48:05.197]  We talked about this before.
[02:48:05.257 --> 02:48:06.118]  The police pull you over.
[02:48:06.158 --> 02:48:08.259]  Instead of writing you one ticket, they write you four tickets.
[02:48:09.346 --> 02:48:09.666]  Why?
[02:48:09.866 --> 02:48:11.047]  Are they just revenuers?
[02:48:11.468 --> 02:48:17.592]  Are they just trying to pump up their own resume so that they can get a promotion?
[02:48:18.292 --> 02:48:19.313]  Well, that's my other issue.
[02:48:19.333 --> 02:48:25.017]  When I see them pulling over some lady in a $100,000 Mercedes with her hair done perfect, writing them tickets,
[02:48:26.058 --> 02:48:27.039]  I don't mind it as much.
[02:48:27.059 --> 02:48:29.262]  I'm not a Robin Hood guy, but that lady can handle it.
[02:48:29.622 --> 02:48:37.210]  When I see a woman with kids climbing around in a car and it's 110 on the road and she's got her hair, you can tell she's broke, and they're writing her tickets, man, I get mad.
[02:48:37.771 --> 02:48:38.692]  I mean, that is sick.
[02:48:39.053 --> 02:48:44.959]  Traffic tickets are a huge economic barrier to the lower economic citizens.
[02:48:44.999 --> 02:48:46.541]  And it seems like they're targeting poor people.
[02:48:46.781 --> 02:48:51.482]  And then they get warrants for your arrest because you can't pay your ticket, so they put you on payment plans and charge you interest.
[02:48:52.222 --> 02:48:56.804]  Or, you know, you lose your car, you can't pay for your insurance.
[02:48:56.844 --> 02:48:57.644]  When does it stop?
[02:48:58.424 --> 02:48:59.624]  We need to ease off of this.
[02:49:00.284 --> 02:49:03.985]  Less government, less crime or criminal offenses.
[02:49:04.005 --> 02:49:06.186]  So where do you stand on the Second Amendment though?
[02:49:06.206 --> 02:49:07.386]  Sounds like you want it even more open.
[02:49:07.406 --> 02:49:10.227]  You want like a Vermont open carry style?
[02:49:10.407 --> 02:49:11.568]  I have no problem at all with that.
[02:49:11.988 --> 02:49:12.269]  None.
[02:49:12.549 --> 02:49:13.550]  Now you better be smart.
[02:49:13.710 --> 02:49:17.433]  If you're carrying a weapon and cops pull you over, don't put your hand on it.
[02:49:17.734 --> 02:49:18.975]  I mean, you know, that's just common sense.
[02:49:18.995 --> 02:49:21.197]  No, sure, but that's up to, if somebody's an idiot, that's their issue.
[02:49:21.297 --> 02:49:21.777]  That's right.
[02:49:22.538 --> 02:49:27.502]  And so, you know, put a helmet on them because they aren't going to survive a collision without a seatbelt.
[02:49:28.163 --> 02:49:31.186]  But the Constitution says we have the right to bear arms.
[02:49:32.627 --> 02:49:33.688]  Arms, that's firearms.
[02:49:34.048 --> 02:49:35.249]  Bear, that means carry.
[02:49:35.990 --> 02:49:36.691]  It's pretty simple.
[02:49:37.910 --> 02:49:39.731]  But you don't have a right to menace someone.
[02:49:39.991 --> 02:49:41.691]  No, then you're violating the law.
[02:49:42.231 --> 02:49:47.153]  Just like the libertarian principle of live your own life free, but don't infringe upon mine.
[02:49:47.553 --> 02:49:50.534]  That's all I ask of you.
[02:49:50.994 --> 02:49:55.356]  When you start looking at the state laws, don't even think about the federal laws.
[02:49:55.996 --> 02:49:57.498]  But the morality issues?
[02:49:58.058 --> 02:50:01.722]  What business do I have to tell you how to live your life if you're not hurting me and my family?
[02:50:02.062 --> 02:50:02.482]  Zero.
[02:50:02.723 --> 02:50:03.183]  Thank you.
[02:50:03.443 --> 02:50:06.807]  So why do we let the politicians... Whatever happened to mind your own business?
[02:50:07.467 --> 02:50:12.973]  We've seen cases in Texas of nine-year-olds playing in parks across the street from the house, and the mother's taken to jail.
[02:50:13.954 --> 02:50:30.584]  Oh, listen, in Texas right now, if a mother is arrested for possession of marijuana, CPS will come investigate their family to make sure that their kids aren't being, well, I'm sorry, they start off with the premise, you're an unfit parent, because you smoke marijuana.
[02:50:31.224 --> 02:50:32.105]  That is a joke.
[02:50:32.185 --> 02:50:37.108]  I've been at Barton Springs and I've been in a restaurant, a couple of places and heard, good looking families.
[02:50:38.257 --> 02:50:39.878]  You know, I mean, professional type people.
[02:50:39.918 --> 02:50:46.642]  Now imagine the poor folks going, yeah, my sister went in to have the baby, and they found a little bit of marijuana in her system and they took it.
[02:50:48.022 --> 02:50:52.705]  And they're calling it child abuse, when statistically it doesn't even do anything.
[02:50:52.745 --> 02:50:57.988]  I mean, it just shows they want to, the great crime is the state's taking your kids over something that's nothing.
[02:50:58.188 --> 02:50:59.009]  That's child abuse.
[02:50:59.149 --> 02:51:01.750]  We'll be right back with our guest, DWI Dude.com.

[02:52:07.170 --> 02:52:11.152]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:52:11.192 --> 02:52:15.274]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:52:15.514 --> 02:52:18.895]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:52:19.135 --> 02:52:21.997]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:52:22.157 --> 02:52:29.440]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:52:29.680 --> 02:52:33.262]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:52:33.542 --> 02:52:37.783]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:52:37.943 --> 02:52:43.805]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:52:43.845 --> 02:52:47.585]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:52:47.745 --> 02:52:50.266]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:52:50.466 --> 02:52:51.806]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:52:51.966 --> 02:52:53.187]  It's time to take action.
[02:52:53.307 --> 02:52:55.027]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:54:14.806 --> 02:54:20.851]  I want to thank all our aminem affiliates and folks out there, but I wanted to ask you about cop culture.
[02:54:20.911 --> 02:54:25.915]  You tell me some amazing stories behind the scenes, that former narcotics detective that works for you.
[02:54:41.027 --> 02:54:43.928]  Investigations are telling me stories only got shot in the neck and the rest of it.
[02:54:44.229 --> 02:54:45.089]  It is a rough job.
[02:54:45.109 --> 02:54:46.230]  I want to spend some time on that.
[02:54:46.590 --> 02:54:54.835]  Briefly, don't forget this hour was brought to you by MyPatriotsSupply.com forward slash Alex are the best storable foods company out there in my view.

[02:55:22.982 --> 02:55:27.107]  It's called Mainstream Conspiracy Theories, the special issue, and so much more.
[02:55:28.223 --> 02:55:33.847]  You've got your older officers that are more or less in charge of training the younger guys.
[02:55:49.071 --> 02:55:55.293]  I worked on some various shifts, but there's cool cops on shifts, and then there's jerk cops.
[02:55:55.893 --> 02:55:58.433]  There's just anywhere you go in any job, you've got that.
[02:55:59.154 --> 02:56:02.134]  But the problem is these young cops, they want to be accepted.
[02:56:02.174 --> 02:56:03.855]  They want to make their numbers.
[02:56:03.895 --> 02:56:05.715]  They want to get the pat on the back.
[02:56:06.335 --> 02:56:10.176]  And a lot of times, they'll fall under the control of the jerk cops.
[02:56:13.385 --> 02:56:20.171]  You see that happening, and you can almost... Because when they're rookie cops, they're being scrutinized pretty severely by the supervisors.
[02:56:20.651 --> 02:56:23.093]  Nobody's going to be let go for being a decent guy.
[02:56:23.553 --> 02:56:25.655]  But they're worried about matching the statistics.
[02:56:26.055 --> 02:56:28.537]  You know, you've got to write so many tickets, you've got to make so many arrests.
[02:56:28.998 --> 02:56:32.481]  That's why I don't like this numbers game that they've got going on with the police departments.
[02:56:33.083 --> 02:56:34.944]  Which they always denied and now has admitted.
[02:56:35.485 --> 02:56:37.346]  Yes, it is the most ridiculous thing ever.
[02:56:37.626 --> 02:56:42.689]  Tell you what, when I worked out in East Austin and was told I had to write so many tickets, I'd come in with warning tickets.
[02:56:43.330 --> 02:56:44.931]  And I said, hey, I'm doing contacts.
[02:56:44.971 --> 02:56:46.272]  They'd get on me about that.
[02:56:46.292 --> 02:56:47.272]  They said, we need tickets.
[02:56:47.733 --> 02:56:52.656]  So I'd write to people their tickets for expired inspection sticker or equipment violations.
[02:56:52.956 --> 02:56:54.497]  And I'd tell them, go to court.
[02:56:54.677 --> 02:56:55.438]  I won't show up.
[02:56:55.818 --> 02:57:00.041]  Why would I want to take the money out of their pocket that they could fix their car with or feed their kids with?
[02:57:00.081 --> 02:57:02.883]  Well, more and more, the police pull people over I know and say just that.
[02:57:03.904 --> 02:57:05.546]  Go to court, I won't be there and they're not there.
[02:57:05.566 --> 02:57:14.118]  And of course then, you know, at some point the prosecutors get all mad and start complaining to the police department and then they start threatening to give days without pay for cops.
[02:57:14.158 --> 02:57:19.184]  The truth is this money isn't even needed to run cities like Austin that is just overflowing with property tax.
[02:57:20.646 --> 02:57:21.707]  The police department.
[02:57:22.107 --> 02:57:25.150]  The police officers ought to be liked by the citizens.
[02:57:25.310 --> 02:57:27.151]  And for the most part they are in Austin.
[02:57:27.671 --> 02:57:32.895]  But you and I are both aware that there are some guys on our police department here that need to be reined in.
[02:57:33.336 --> 02:57:34.517]  They are out of control.
[02:57:34.537 --> 02:57:38.760]  Wearing the black gloves and marching around being ugly, talking to you.
[02:57:38.780 --> 02:57:42.404]  Well sure, if I saw somebody like them without the uniform, I would immediately feel aggressive.
[02:57:42.764 --> 02:57:51.032]  And I won't go to 6th Street sometimes, I see those type of cops, they're looking at me with a crazed look, and I immediately, like, start, you know, it's like, what are you looking at me like that for?
[02:57:51.152 --> 02:57:53.094]  Oh, when they're trying to clear the streets on 6th Street.
[02:57:53.154 --> 02:57:53.374]  Oh yeah.
[02:57:54.075 --> 02:57:56.617]  I've been down there a few times advertising, I don't drink.
[02:57:57.018 --> 02:57:57.939]  I'm totally sober.
[02:57:58.499 --> 02:58:00.682]  And they're treating all of us like garbage.
[02:58:00.762 --> 02:58:03.505]  And I'm like, man, we would have never done this when I was a cop.
[02:58:03.825 --> 02:58:09.672]  They'd have jerked us in on the carpet and threatened us with days off for being verbally abusive to people.
[02:58:10.172 --> 02:58:15.418]  If somebody was videotaping me, the idea of telling them to put that camera up or turn, they have the right to do it.
[02:58:15.959 --> 02:58:17.341]  What right do I have to tell them that?
[02:58:17.741 --> 02:58:18.762]  It just blows me away.
[02:58:20.425 --> 02:58:23.973]  We just need the police department to lighten up a little bit.
[02:58:24.253 --> 02:58:28.482]  To try to be our protectors and our servants and not our bosses.
[02:58:30.499 --> 02:58:35.121]  When we come back, they'll finish the story about the cool cop group versus the thug.
[02:58:35.941 --> 02:58:40.162]  It sounds just like high school, where you got kind of the thug gang of guys and you got the cool guys.
[02:58:40.502 --> 02:58:44.023]  We'll be right back with Jamie Balasia, EWIDude.com.
[02:58:44.303 --> 02:58:45.844]  I'm Alex Jones with Infowars.com.
[02:58:45.904 --> 02:58:47.784]  Back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:58:47.884 --> 02:58:49.345]  live in studio.
[02:58:49.365 --> 02:58:50.765]  It's going to be a special broadcast.
[02:58:51.125 --> 02:58:53.686]  And I'll be on the news tonight, 7 o'clock.
[02:58:54.206 --> 02:58:55.007]  7 central tonight.
[02:58:55.267 --> 02:58:56.087]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:58:57.259 --> 02:58:59.140]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[02:58:59.481 --> 02:59:07.386]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:59:07.526 --> 02:59:14.811]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:59:15.071 --> 02:59:19.334]  I just received my Male Vitality about three days ago, and I must say, that is some good stuff.
[02:59:19.654 --> 02:59:29.844]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[02:59:30.285 --> 02:59:36.471]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:59:36.771 --> 02:59:39.033]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:59:39.133 --> 02:59:43.017]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[02:59:43.157 --> 02:59:44.758]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[02:59:45.118 --> 02:59:49.039]  All the products in Infowarslife.com are simply amazing.
[02:59:49.259 --> 02:59:56.222]  Visit Infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from Infowarslife.
[02:59:58.183 --> 02:59:59.343]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:59.703 --> 03:00:01.084]  Direct from Austin.
[03:00:01.764 --> 03:00:04.966]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:13.243 --> 03:00:13.883]  Big Brother.
[03:00:14.544 --> 03:00:15.565]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:16.305 --> 03:00:17.406]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:18.066 --> 03:00:18.867]  You want answers?
[03:00:19.647 --> 03:00:20.568]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:21.208 --> 03:00:24.811]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:25.391 --> 03:00:27.733]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[03:00:28.613 --> 03:00:29.454]  Alex Jones.
[03:00:29.654 --> 03:00:33.197]  Well, I want to thank Jamie Bollesia to come in while I rant and rave.
[03:00:33.677 --> 03:00:35.799]  I want to get him in on a regular basis for the nightly news, too.
[03:00:35.859 --> 03:00:43.165]  I'm going to come show you our new studio here in a minute, since you were last here, but finish up with your story about the three different types of cops, on average.
[03:00:43.565 --> 03:00:47.208]  Then you were kind of ranting about so-called drug interdiction officers.
[03:00:47.887 --> 03:00:58.393]  You know, in cadet class, I looked around and it's almost like you can see the little puppy who's got their tongue dripping and wagging their tail everywhere and they just want to impress somebody.
[03:00:58.853 --> 03:01:00.254]  That's the kind that will run after these...
[03:01:01.534 --> 03:01:05.676]  Rude, brutal cops and do their bidding and be trained by them.
[03:01:07.117 --> 03:01:10.758]  It's almost like, you know, Igor to Dr. Frankenstein.
[03:01:11.299 --> 03:01:14.260]  Then you've got your guys who have an idea of what's going on.
[03:01:14.300 --> 03:01:15.321]  They know how to survive.
[03:01:15.361 --> 03:01:17.902]  They know how to make it with the department.
[03:01:17.922 --> 03:01:23.144]  They're going to do their job, but they're not going to go overboard and be ugly to the citizens.
[03:01:23.765 --> 03:01:30.368]  And then there seemed to be a lower percentage of us that actually went out of our way to help people out.
[03:01:32.149 --> 03:01:42.993]  We, there was more compassion, but you know you have to balance that with the supervisors wanting you to bring in revenue, wanting to bring in the tickets, the arrest.
[03:01:44.073 --> 03:01:47.995]  So it's just like we blame the TSA, but it's Congress that did it, they're to blame.
[03:01:48.395 --> 03:01:50.596]  Exactly, it's the people on top that are doing this.
[03:01:50.836 --> 03:01:51.356]  That's right.
[03:01:51.536 --> 03:01:55.479]  And, you know, everybody talks about the brass going to their heads.
[03:01:55.559 --> 03:02:01.042]  It's like one of your best friends is a police officer who's a great guy you wanted to make calls with.
[03:02:01.682 --> 03:02:03.543]  If things got nasty, he was there with you.
[03:02:03.804 --> 03:02:05.425]  But he didn't make them go nasty.
[03:02:06.225 --> 03:02:12.088]  But then put some sergeant stripes on him and all of a sudden he became just like the jerk sergeant he used to complain about.
[03:02:13.309 --> 03:02:15.751]  And yet the cool sergeants, the cool lieutenants,
[03:02:17.031 --> 03:02:22.994]  They've got to really watch their P's and Q's because those other guys are watching them to snitch on them or get them in trouble anytime they can.
[03:02:24.815 --> 03:02:28.557]  It's funny, that analogy about high school, that plays all the way through at the police department.
[03:02:28.577 --> 03:02:29.677]  You've got the same thing happening.
[03:02:30.037 --> 03:02:42.063]  But when you're recruiting people and training them to use command voice to put fear in somebody, that if a police officer pulls you over and you start questioning like you did about the speed,
[03:02:43.504 --> 03:02:45.245]  It's almost like you spit in their face or something.
[03:02:45.265 --> 03:02:47.606]  They just go berserk on you, and all of a sudden you're getting arrested.
[03:02:48.346 --> 03:02:49.487]  That's not what we need out here.
[03:02:49.507 --> 03:02:52.729]  I was mentioning the drug interdiction officers.
[03:02:53.189 --> 03:02:57.292]  When I wanted to become a police officer, I thought, oh, I'm going to be helpful to people.
[03:02:58.012 --> 03:03:02.115]  When people are having emergencies and they call 911, I'll come running.
[03:03:02.495 --> 03:03:03.956]  I'll be like a hero kind of a guy.
[03:03:04.876 --> 03:03:08.823]  Um, instead, a drug interdiction officer has one purpose.
[03:03:09.123 --> 03:03:11.206]  That's to seize assets.
[03:03:11.627 --> 03:03:12.008]  Drugs.
[03:03:14.167 --> 03:03:18.911]  They even changed the directional enforcement of the laws on these interdiction officers.
[03:03:19.391 --> 03:03:22.694]  They don't want them catching the drugs going one direction.
[03:03:22.994 --> 03:03:25.216]  They want them catching the money going back towards the border.
[03:03:25.977 --> 03:03:28.299]  And that's been revealed in all the states.
[03:03:28.319 --> 03:03:29.940]  Sure, they're letting the drugs in.
[03:03:30.401 --> 03:03:33.643]  Or they'll say, oh, we found drugs on your money.
[03:03:33.703 --> 03:03:34.124]  Let us keep $5,000.
[03:03:34.284 --> 03:03:37.466]  We won't indict you, knowing almost all money has drugs on it.
[03:03:37.927 --> 03:03:38.387]  All money.
[03:03:38.407 --> 03:03:40.129]  It's all these ridiculous games.
[03:03:40.569 --> 03:03:41.570]  Yeah, it's a joke.
[03:03:41.730 --> 03:03:50.235]  That's why I think that passing some laws, which I don't really, you know, advocate passing more laws, but passing... Laws to suppress unconstitutional laws.
[03:03:50.275 --> 03:04:03.423]  That will make them use that forfeited money to fix the problem, get people some treatment, get people some job training, open up some opportunities for somebody to get out of the... Yeah, make them get rid of the problem instead of making it bigger.
[03:04:03.723 --> 03:04:04.223]  Exactly.
[03:04:04.303 --> 03:04:05.444]  Stop forcing them into games.
[03:04:05.464 --> 03:04:08.125]  But every police officer I talk to says the same thing, pretty much.
[03:04:08.345 --> 03:04:09.126]  They all get it now.
[03:04:09.326 --> 03:04:10.988]  Well, the ones that don't talk to you.
[03:04:11.008 --> 03:04:15.191]  I was about to say, I say all the cops in Austin listen, I guess that's the ones that listen say hi.
[03:04:15.552 --> 03:04:15.792]  Right.
[03:04:16.272 --> 03:04:16.733]  That's right.
[03:04:16.753 --> 03:04:19.976]  The ones that don't agree with us, they're the jerks.
[03:04:19.996 --> 03:04:23.979]  They're waiting to see us have a defective taillight so they can pull us over and shoot us with a taser.
[03:04:24.680 --> 03:04:24.980]  You know?
[03:04:25.541 --> 03:04:25.781]  Wow.
[03:04:26.762 --> 03:04:27.863]  Have you ever had any of them threaten you?
[03:04:29.165 --> 03:04:32.028]  I've got a bit of a reputation that I don't get threatened.
[03:04:33.509 --> 03:04:36.772]  They know who I used to be and it wouldn't take much to get me back there.
[03:04:37.192 --> 03:04:41.836]  I try to be a reasonable person, but I won't let anybody brutalize me or push me around.
[03:04:42.397 --> 03:04:43.578]  I can always pass a polygraph.
[03:04:44.705 --> 03:04:53.472]  If I had to, if it came down to a cop lying to me, I always tell people if I ever get busted for drugs, they planted them, and I'll take whatever testing I have to to prove it.
[03:04:53.492 --> 03:04:57.415]  Jamie Bellagio, come in in a few weeks again on the Nightly News and stop by here.
[03:04:57.435 --> 03:04:57.616]  Right.
[03:04:58.096 --> 03:04:59.677]  DWIDUDE.COM.
[03:04:59.977 --> 03:05:01.459]  And come in sometime and tell us some cop stories.
[03:05:01.479 --> 03:05:02.119]  Those are always interesting.
[03:05:02.139 --> 03:05:03.000]  I'll bring Steve with me.
[03:05:03.280 --> 03:05:03.720]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:05:04.021 --> 03:05:04.701]  Have both of you in.
[03:05:05.462 --> 03:05:06.743]  I'll see you guys in the Nightly News.
[03:05:10.871 --> 03:05:11.272]  Whoa!
[03:05:12.012 --> 03:05:13.614]  This is big!
[03:05:14.456 --> 03:05:19.882]  By popular demand, the Freeze-Dry Guys Giant Factory Authorized Sale has been extended.
[03:05:20.243 --> 03:05:21.284]  Now through August.
[03:05:21.384 --> 03:05:24.548]  And prepare per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver.
