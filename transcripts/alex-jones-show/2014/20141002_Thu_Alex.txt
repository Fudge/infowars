[00:00:01.693 --> 00:00:04.580]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:00:05.282 --> 00:00:08.490]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:00:16.414 --> 00:00:17.035]  Big Brother.
[00:00:17.715 --> 00:00:18.736]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:19.477 --> 00:00:20.598]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:22.060]  You want answers?
[00:00:22.841 --> 00:00:23.742]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.382 --> 00:00:27.986]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.567 --> 00:00:32.631]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.824 --> 00:00:43.749]  It's Paul Joseph Watson with the Alex Jones Show on this Thursday, October 2nd, filling in for Alex.
[00:00:43.849 --> 00:00:48.393]  Hopefully we will have Alex calling in from the road a little later on in the show.
[00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:58.382]  We've also got Lionel from Lionel Media popping in in the third hour to discuss media narratives, the latest Ebola news, and a whole gamut of different subjects.
[00:00:58.422 --> 00:01:00.824]  But we're focusing on Ebola in the first hour.
[00:01:01.264 --> 00:01:04.026]  David Knight will be in in the second hour also.
[00:01:04.827 --> 00:01:19.533]  So, the latest news, of course, is that we've now got potentially up to a hundred patients, alleged, supposed victims exposed to the Ebola virus as a result of this individual who arrived in Dallas last week from Liberia.
[00:01:19.914 --> 00:01:24.015]  We also have another case in Hawaii, which they're investigating at the moment.
[00:01:24.135 --> 00:01:28.897]  Not confirmed that it's Ebola, but they're saying that it's very possible that that could be the case.
[00:01:28.957 --> 00:01:29.998]  Now it's up to a hundred.
[00:01:30.078 --> 00:01:32.439]  Texas checks a hundred for Ebola exposure.
[00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:37.564]  So, yesterday it went from 12 to 18, 80 this morning, now they're saying 100.
[00:01:37.704 --> 00:01:54.521]  We're also following another case in a different state where there is another potential Ebola victim that's not being confirmed, but there is a medical worker there in that state saying that it is about to be confirmed within the next few hours, so we'll continue to keep track of that.
[00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:58.085]  Big headlines coming up today on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:01:59.167 --> 00:02:11.180]  Biggest, as far as I'm concerned, is on the top left of DrudgeReport.com, which is red-linked, and it's UN Ebola chief raises nightmare prospect that virus could mutate and become airborne if it is not quickly brought under control.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.921]  Obviously this is a...
[00:02:12.842 --> 00:02:20.029]  An issue that we've been discussing for weeks and months, the potential that Ebola has, at least to a limited extent, gone airborne.
[00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:25.234]  Now we have one of the UN's top Ebola professionals in charge of the situation saying the same thing.
[00:02:25.274 --> 00:02:34.302]  The longer the Ebola epidemic continues infecting people, unabated, the higher the chances it will mutate and become airborne, the UN's Ebola response chief has warned.
[00:02:35.205 --> 00:02:53.744]  And this is Anthony Banbury, the Secretary General's Special Representative, who said that there's a nightmare prospect, and this is not Alex Jones saying this, this is the head of the UN Ebola response team, a nightmare prospect that the deadly disease will become airborne if it continues infecting new hosts.
[00:02:53.784 --> 00:02:57.428]  His comments come as organisations battling the crisis in West Africa warn.
[00:02:57.888 --> 00:03:04.217]  That the international community has just four weeks to stop it before it spirals completely out of control.
[00:03:04.257 --> 00:03:06.139]  There you see the article out of the Daily Mail.
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.108]  Which of course ties into this separate article which we've got up on Infowars.com which we're going to cover in more detail.
[00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:26.518]  Out of shtfplan.com, Max Slavo, who we're trying to get on the show today, if not today, maybe tomorrow, report disaster teams were notified months ago they would be activated in October.
[00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:43.409]  And this was DART teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams, no word yet on exactly where in the country, but they were told to prepare to be activated in the month of October, and that's according to a public tweet from a large government supplier of emergency response products specializing in high-risk events.
[00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:52.434]  So they basically put out a tweet, and you can see it in this article there, said that we are now hearing this is the tip of the iceberg as we enter October.
[00:03:52.494 --> 00:03:58.958]  And in a subsequent tweet they said, dark teams were notified months ago they would be activated in October.
[00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.980]  Timing seems weird.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:08.685]  And they cite the source as a current dark member, and that's Golden State Fire EMS, a company that specializes in
[00:04:09.525 --> 00:04:11.126]  High-risk events.
[00:04:11.466 --> 00:04:17.770]  They haven't retracted that on Twitter, it's still out there, so we're trying to pin down more details on that.
[00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:26.775]  Of course, in regard to the airborne transmission of Ebola, which the UN is now warning about, we had this story up on InfoWars.com yesterday.
[00:04:26.875 --> 00:04:31.477]  Canadian health agency deletes info on airborne spread of Ebola.
[00:04:31.918 --> 00:04:36.900]  And this is the Public Health Agency of Canada, this is their official health agency,
[00:04:37.941 --> 00:04:45.583]  Around about the end of August here, you can see that they had an advisory on their website saying that airborne spread among humans is strongly suspected.
[00:04:45.964 --> 00:04:47.284]  They later deleted that.
[00:04:47.384 --> 00:04:49.845]  We're going to get into that and more Ebola info.
[00:04:49.865 --> 00:04:54.026]  We're going to get into the Hong Kong protests and a lot more besides that.
[00:04:54.126 --> 00:04:56.347]  Lionel coming up, Alex Jones popping in.
[00:04:56.847 --> 00:05:00.668]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live, Thursday, October 2nd edition.
[00:05:00.828 --> 00:05:02.569]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex.
[00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:05.630]  We'll be right back with all the breaking Ebola news.
[00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:06.330]  Stay right there.
[00:05:10.563 --> 00:05:14.064]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:14.204 --> 00:05:18.165]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:19.945]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:20.265 --> 00:05:25.287]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[00:05:25.607 --> 00:05:27.847]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[00:05:28.127 --> 00:05:28.968]  But for how long?
[00:05:29.268 --> 00:05:31.268]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[00:05:31.468 --> 00:05:35.529]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:38.710]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:05:40.091 --> 00:05:41.091]  DNA Force.
[00:05:41.151 --> 00:05:44.372]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:05:44.432 --> 00:05:45.452]  DNA Force.
[00:05:45.572 --> 00:05:53.614]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:05:53.734 --> 00:05:58.775]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:05:58.815 --> 00:05:59.816]  DNA Force.
[00:05:59.856 --> 00:06:01.716]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:06:11.283 --> 00:06:12.344]  In the near future.
[00:06:12.364 --> 00:06:16.806]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[00:06:17.146 --> 00:06:18.167]  Security alert.
[00:06:18.367 --> 00:06:20.128]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:06:20.368 --> 00:06:23.910]  Analysis, InfoWars, building, independent media operation.
[00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.672]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we
[00:06:26.892 --> 00:06:28.915]  We are the ones responsible.
[00:06:28.935 --> 00:06:31.338]  Prior directive, discredit Alex Jones.
[00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:34.302]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:06:34.383 --> 00:06:37.427]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:06:37.627 --> 00:06:39.850]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.473]  These people are assaulting us!
[00:06:41.513 --> 00:06:43.696]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:06:44.296 --> 00:06:45.937]  They're never going to stop.
[00:06:46.217 --> 00:06:49.857]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[00:06:49.898 --> 00:06:56.519]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:06:57.219 --> 00:07:00.360]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.600]  You can feel it.
[00:07:09.815 --> 00:07:11.055]  What are you waiting for?
[00:07:11.256 --> 00:07:16.097]  You've heard what the proprietary Super Male Vitality formulation has done for others.
[00:07:16.257 --> 00:07:20.039]  Now, it's time to experience the natural benefits for yourself.
[00:07:20.459 --> 00:07:36.885]  Pairing ancient herbal extraction techniques with revolutionary technological advances, Super Male Vitality offers the most powerful essence of eight different ingredients, all individually blended into what makes this product such a unique and concentrated solution.
[00:07:36.985 --> 00:07:39.086]  Avoid alarming artificial additives.
[00:07:39.406 --> 00:07:44.409]  And even hidden genetically modified ingredients that may be lurking in your medicine cabinet.
[00:08:25.833 --> 00:08:28.114]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:28.534 --> 00:08:33.696]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.403]  We're back on this Thursday, October 2nd edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:52.463 --> 00:08:55.786]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson, your host, filling in for Alex Jones.
[00:08:55.806 --> 00:09:01.370]  We expect Alex to be popping in at some point during the broadcast with breaking Ebola news.
[00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:07.315]  We're going to go to a clip in a minute out of local Hawaii news about a potential new Ebola case there.
[00:09:07.775 --> 00:09:11.758]  But as I was mentioning before the break, we had this story up on Infowars.com yesterday.
[00:09:12.178 --> 00:09:16.662]  Canadian health agency deletes info on airborne spread of Ebola.
[00:09:17.162 --> 00:09:34.551]  And this was one of the main sources that I cited, of course, in the aftermath of the 2012 Canadian study where they proved that Ebola could be spread via the respiratory tract between pigs infected with Ebola and monkeys who were kept in the same pen but separated by a wire fence.
[00:09:35.212 --> 00:09:37.713]  So there was no physical contact between them, of course.
[00:09:37.733 --> 00:09:44.397]  We're being told over and over again that you can only catch Ebola by having physical contact exchange of bodily fluids.
[00:09:44.997 --> 00:10:03.331]  But now top experts are questioning that, and as far back as the end of August actually, the Canadian Public Health Agency, which is their official public health body, had on their official website this quote, which is the airborne spread among humans of Ebola, is quote, strongly suspected.
[00:10:04.318 --> 00:10:06.900]  Now, if you take a look at that now, it's changed.
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:11.743]  It says, airborne transmission has not been demonstrated between non-human primates.
[00:10:11.803 --> 00:10:21.129]  So, it's interesting that they rolled that back at the end of August, or just after the end of August, when all these questions were being asked about the airborne spread of Ebola.
[00:10:21.569 --> 00:10:28.554]  Of course, we had major doctors go public in the New York Times, in the op-ed pages, basically asking the same question.
[00:10:29.074 --> 00:10:30.235]  Has this mutated?
[00:10:30.315 --> 00:10:32.316]  Has it gone airborne, at least to some extent?
[00:10:33.217 --> 00:10:41.284]  We've had hundreds of health workers in Africa, including Western health workers, die after contracting Ebola.
[00:10:41.384 --> 00:10:56.757]  Of course, you would normally expect them to take the utmost precautions in avoiding bodily contact and avoiding swapping bodily fluids with Ebola victims, and yet hundreds have died, which of course leads to this top story, which is the UN's top Ebola chief
[00:10:57.518 --> 00:11:04.353]  Razor's nightmare prospect that virus could mutate and become airborne if it's not quickly brought under control.
[00:11:04.854 --> 00:11:07.741]  So basically this top official, Anthony Banbury...
[00:11:08.775 --> 00:11:24.641]  Is saying, if we don't get a hold of this now, as it spreads, you know, in its natural state, which is not via airborne transmission, as far as we understand, if we don't clamp down on it now, then it could indeed go airborne, and of course then that opens up a whole nightmare scenario.
[00:11:25.061 --> 00:11:32.684]  And again, major story up on Infowars.com today, out of SHTF plan, report disaster teams were notified months ago
[00:11:33.524 --> 00:11:35.705]  They would be activated in November.
[00:11:35.745 --> 00:11:38.105]  So this was Disaster Assistance Response Teams.
[00:11:38.505 --> 00:11:54.589]  According to a source within DART, they were told last month, at least as long as a month ago, actually more than a month ago, that they would be notified or activated in October as a result of a major Ebola outbreak in the United States.
[00:11:54.609 --> 00:11:59.590]  You can see the tweets up there from Golden State Fire EMS, which is a company that sells
[00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:09.478]  Health products and health services to government agencies in America, and they said that these dark teams were notified months ago they would be activated in October.
[00:12:10.019 --> 00:12:12.841]  Timing seems weird, and people challenge them on that.
[00:12:12.881 --> 00:12:15.724]  They haven't retracted it, so we'll continue to dig into it.
[00:12:16.424 --> 00:12:19.807]  Another story which we're going to get into more detail about is this one.
[00:12:20.868 --> 00:12:24.809]  Commentary health workers need optimal respiratory protection for Ebola.
[00:12:25.329 --> 00:12:39.172]  Now this is fascinating because it's written by Dr. Brusso and Dr. Jones at the University of Illinois at Chicago, Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, and basically they ask the same question that this U.N.
[00:12:39.212 --> 00:12:40.813]  Ebola chief is asking.
[00:12:41.713 --> 00:12:45.717]  Do we truly understand the communicable nature of Ebola?
[00:12:45.757 --> 00:12:52.883]  They're talking about compelling the use of respiratory protection, not just face masks.
[00:12:52.903 --> 00:12:57.728]  So in this article they get into the fact that Ebola has, quote, unclear modes of transmission.
[00:12:58.837 --> 00:13:16.809]  They talk about their belief that there's, quote, a scientific and epidemiological evidence that the Ebola virus has the potential to be transmitted via infectious aerosol particles both near and at a distance from infected patients, which means that healthcare workers should be wearing respirators, not face masks.
[00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:28.220]  So, our current understanding is that this Ebola virus can be transmitted via droplets from coughing or sneezing, but that you have to be very near the victim, so within three feet.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:36.869]  According to this study, by these professors out of the University of Illinois in Chicago, that's not the case.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:44.822]  They talk about the fact there's been a lot of online and published controversy about whether the Ebola virus can be transmitted via aerosols.
[00:13:45.482 --> 00:13:54.344]  Most scientific and medical personnel, along with public health organisations, have been unequivocal in their statements that Ebola can be transmitted only by direct contact with virus-laden fluids.
[00:13:54.764 --> 00:13:56.265]  And we've heard that over and over again.
[00:13:57.365 --> 00:14:16.417]  Over the past couple of days with this case arriving in America of course the CDC or the health authorities trying to downplay the threat of Ebola after the fact that they botched it by allowing this Ebola victim to basically walk around Dallas for a period of four days exposing at least a hundred people to the Ebola virus.
[00:14:17.017 --> 00:14:23.199]  And the aftermath of that going public, they downplayed any potential that this could be airborne.
[00:14:23.219 --> 00:14:32.821]  But as we've seen both with the UN official, top German virologists, doctors that have written editorials in the New York Times, it's very much a concern.
[00:14:32.861 --> 00:14:36.882]  And it's a concern for these professors out of the University of Illinois.
[00:14:36.922 --> 00:14:37.943]  They talk about the fact that
[00:14:38.963 --> 00:14:57.355]  Our current understanding that Ebola is not airborne, transmissible, at least to a limited extent, over three feet, reflects, quote, an incorrect and outmoded understanding of infectious aerosols, which has been institutionalized in politics, language, culture, and approaches to infection control.
[00:14:58.115 --> 00:15:11.298]  So they go through the fact that this could indeed be airborne to a greater extent than three feet, to a greater extent than somebody coughing and sneezing, which of course in terms of airline travel is crucial.
[00:15:12.139 --> 00:15:24.462]  No flights have been cancelled so far despite the fact that France, the United Arab Emirates, Britain and other countries have cancelled flights as a result of this Ebola outbreak in Africa weeks and months ago.
[00:15:25.462 --> 00:15:49.174]  Now flight attendants and border patrol agents in America are being told to watch for signs of Ebola, despite the fact that I saw a case on CNN the other day where the CNN reporters who had been in Liberia openly stated to border control to the flight attendants that they had been there, they need to be checked for potential exposure to the Ebola virus, potential symptoms.
[00:15:50.074 --> 00:15:55.438]  The Customs and Border Patrol agents, according to these CNN reporters, were not interested.
[00:15:55.938 --> 00:16:00.041]  So we've had the CDC saying for months that they had this under control, that it wasn't a threat.
[00:16:00.361 --> 00:16:04.183]  You know, Obama said it was very unlikely there would be an Ebola case in the United States.
[00:16:04.684 --> 00:16:07.286]  And it appears they've been caught with their pants down completely.
[00:16:07.886 --> 00:16:09.427]  Completely unprepared for this.
[00:16:09.827 --> 00:16:12.749]  They failed to deal with it when it sprung up in Dallas.
[00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:19.634]  Now we've got a new case in Hawaii, a potential new case, and we're going to go to a local news clip about that now.
[00:16:20.294 --> 00:16:27.559]  Jail health officials say they just found out about this possible case this morning and they do not want the public to be concerned.
[00:16:28.975 --> 00:16:39.019]  We are early in the investigation of a patient, very very early, who we are investigating who might have Ebola.
[00:16:39.239 --> 00:16:44.661]  State health officials confirmed tests are being conducted on a patient who remains hospitalized.
[00:16:45.141 --> 00:16:49.582]  The Hawaii Nurses Association said the person is being treated at Queens.
[00:16:50.123 --> 00:16:56.625]  It's very possible that they do, that they have Ebola, but I think it's also even more likely that they have another condition.
[00:16:57.625 --> 00:17:00.068]  That presents with similar symptoms.
[00:17:00.468 --> 00:17:08.075]  Dr. Melissa Varee said the patient could have a number of illnesses including Ebola, flu, malaria and typhoid.
[00:17:08.696 --> 00:17:14.962]  She wouldn't tell me any symptoms the person was having or if the person had recently traveled to West Africa.
[00:17:15.482 --> 00:17:21.748]  But she did say a big red flag of Ebola is a fever and recent travel to that area.
[00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:23.850]  Why is this person being isolated?
[00:17:25.126 --> 00:17:33.576]  So again, when we've asked the hospital to tell us about, is anyone with a childhood history?
[00:17:34.196 --> 00:17:35.478]  And anyone with a fever?
[00:17:36.279 --> 00:17:44.148]  And when those two come together, we've asked them to be very careful and in abundance of caution while you're working them up for whatever else might be going on.
[00:17:45.249 --> 00:17:50.554]  Also make sure you isolate against Ebola just in case that is the case.
[00:17:50.614 --> 00:17:57.000]  That's a clip out of Hawaii, a potential new case of Ebola, not confirmed yet.
[00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:04.506]  As I said at the beginning of the show, we're also tracking a case in a different state where a health professional, a medical worker, claims
[00:18:05.487 --> 00:18:14.152]  That there is a case that they're about to announce in a completely different state, so if that's the case it would bring us up to a potential of three, but only one confirmed so far.
[00:18:14.573 --> 00:18:21.257]  Of course in Dallas, but he potentially exposed up to a hundred people or more to the Ebola virus.
[00:18:21.957 --> 00:18:40.107]  Mainly because he went into the hospital on September 26 and was turned away, was given antibiotics, despite the fact that he told hospital workers that he had just flown in from Liberia and that he had the symptoms associated with the onset of Ebola.
[00:18:40.147 --> 00:18:42.028]  Here's an article out of The Guardian.
[00:18:42.709 --> 00:18:44.790]  US Ebola patient told staff
[00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:48.772]  of Liberia travel but was allowed to leave hospital.
[00:18:49.373 --> 00:18:55.237]  So our initial understanding of this was that he didn't tell the nurses, the hospital workers, where he had come from.
[00:18:55.257 --> 00:18:56.337]  They didn't ask.
[00:18:56.417 --> 00:18:58.739]  That was obviously the first faux pas.
[00:18:58.799 --> 00:19:03.182]  But now we know that he actually told them directly he had come from Liberia.
[00:19:03.662 --> 00:19:14.409]  Yet they still asked no questions whatsoever, gave him some antibiotics and sent him on his way for a further two days after he had already been in Dallas since September 20th.
[00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:16.871]  And again, no questions asked.
[00:19:16.891 --> 00:19:18.692]  We've also got this out of CNN Health.
[00:19:19.353 --> 00:19:23.415]  Hospital dropped the ball with Ebola patient's travel history.
[00:19:23.936 --> 00:19:35.323]  NH official says the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola on American soil went to the emergency room last week but was released from the hospital even though he told staff he had travelled from Liberia.
[00:19:36.003 --> 00:19:40.146]  A travel history was taken but it wasn't communicated to the people who were making the decision.
[00:19:40.286 --> 00:19:41.207]  It was a mistake.
[00:19:41.367 --> 00:19:42.628]  They dropped the ball.
[00:19:43.168 --> 00:19:43.948]  And that was very
[00:19:45.433 --> 00:19:55.280]  Apparent in the press conference yesterday where they deflected basically any questions about how this was allowed to occur, how this patient was allowed to wander around Dallas for a period of days.
[00:19:55.721 --> 00:20:00.584]  We're going to be back after the break with more Ebola news, also switching gears into other topics.
[00:20:00.624 --> 00:20:01.885]  Going to take your calls 1-800-259-9231.
[00:20:04.427 --> 00:20:09.651]  David Knight coming up second hour, Lionel third hour, Alex Jones Show live, InfoWars.com.
[00:20:10.495 --> 00:20:13.456]  You heard the discussions all over the radio.
[00:20:13.716 --> 00:20:15.796]  You couldn't believe what you were hearing.
[00:20:16.197 --> 00:20:17.157]  You trusted them.
[00:20:17.677 --> 00:20:18.837]  You felt betrayed.
[00:20:19.337 --> 00:20:21.518]  Your emotions began to consume you.
[00:20:21.958 --> 00:20:22.978]  Outrage set in.
[00:20:23.359 --> 00:20:24.679]  Then, nothing.
[00:20:25.059 --> 00:20:26.999]  Days turned to weeks and months.
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.980]  Then... But they haven't.
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:33.141]  They're still monitoring your every move.
[00:20:33.481 --> 00:20:34.141]  It's coming.
[00:20:34.241 --> 00:20:35.162]  What's coming?
[00:20:35.202 --> 00:20:37.422]  MonitorBlocketPocket.com.
[00:20:37.802 --> 00:20:39.483]  Or will you forget?
[00:20:40.003 --> 00:20:49.270]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:50.051]  This capitalism?
[00:20:50.111 --> 00:20:56.235]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:56.275 --> 00:20:59.918]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:20:59.978 --> 00:21:00.899]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:21:00.919 --> 00:21:01.959]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:21:02.119 --> 00:21:02.580]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:02.900]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:09.605 --> 00:21:10.846]  Another major health threat.
[00:21:10.886 --> 00:21:15.769]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:21:15.849 --> 00:21:18.451]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:21:18.471 --> 00:21:25.315]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:21:25.575 --> 00:21:28.437]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:21:28.537 --> 00:21:31.479]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:33.500]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:36.382]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:21:36.442 --> 00:21:41.964]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:21:42.184 --> 00:21:45.666]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:21:45.686 --> 00:21:48.687]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:21:48.767 --> 00:21:55.870]  The ProPure ProOne G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.

[00:22:08.275 --> 00:22:15.277]  The lining of your lungs is supposed to be protected with glutathione to neutralize incoming irritants.
[00:22:15.537 --> 00:22:19.238]  In the absence of enough glutathione, your lungs are more prone to irritation.
[00:22:19.399 --> 00:22:24.540]  Listen to the real-world results of one man using a powerful glutathione-supporting food.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.021]  Hi, my name is Bill O'Brien.
[00:22:26.461 --> 00:22:29.222]  I generally suffer through an asthmatic breathing type situation.
[00:22:29.922 --> 00:22:32.783]  My breathing is shallow and generally constricted in the nose and lungs.
[00:22:33.464 --> 00:22:38.691]  After consuming one world away today, I have tremendous energy and also notice my breathing is free.
[00:22:39.453 --> 00:22:46.443]  I can feel the air in my left nostril and it is free all the way to my abdomen, which is pretty remarkable because I rarely get that feeling.
[00:22:46.483 --> 00:22:48.867]  Being a singer, I love feeling this unrestricted voice.
[00:22:49.547 --> 00:22:52.729]  The only thing new I've actually added to my routine is One World Way.
[00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.570]  Wow!
[00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:54.711]  Call 888-988-3325.

[00:22:55.931 --> 00:22:56.432]  That's OneWorld.
[00:22:56.452 --> 00:22:56.832]  W-H-E-Y.com.
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.281]  Listen up, all you preppers and survival enthusiasts!

[00:23:38.457 --> 00:23:39.237]  News flash.
[00:23:39.457 --> 00:23:41.158]  Home invasions are on the rise.
[00:23:41.418 --> 00:23:43.979]  It takes less than 10 seconds to kick in a door.
[00:23:44.299 --> 00:23:47.000]  10 seconds is not enough time to protect your family.
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.821]  And what would happen if you were not home?
[00:23:49.041 --> 00:23:51.702]  EZ Armor is the ultimate security solution.
[00:23:51.722 --> 00:23:54.282]  85% of break-ins are through a door.

[00:24:38.766 --> 00:24:43.089]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show live, Thursday, October 2nd edition.
[00:24:43.229 --> 00:24:44.430]  I'm your host, Paul Joseph Fox.
[00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:48.653]  I'm filling in for Alex, who we'll be calling in at some point from the road.
[00:24:48.673 --> 00:24:51.394]  We've got a big top story up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:24:51.935 --> 00:24:57.719]  Rand Paul political correctness hindering scientific decisions on Ebola outbreak.
[00:24:58.139 --> 00:25:03.342]  And he says, quote, my suspicion is that it's a lot more transmissible than we've been told.
[00:25:03.442 --> 00:25:07.585]  So this ties into the warning from the UN head that it could have gone airborne.
[00:25:07.625 --> 00:25:08.686]  Now we have Rand Paul
[00:25:09.746 --> 00:25:18.548]  Complaining about political correctness and that hindering the CDC in being able to deal with this Ebola outbreak.
[00:25:19.348 --> 00:25:25.770]  Also saying that it's possibly a lot more transmissible than we've been told, which is developing into a common theme.
[00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:28.651]  We also have this article out of Reuters.
[00:25:29.031 --> 00:25:33.652]  Dallas Ebola patient vomited outside apartment on way to hospital.
[00:25:34.452 --> 00:25:45.096]  So we know that he was taken to the hospital inside this ambulance, which was then used for two days afterwards, potentially exposing other people, health workers, to the Ebola virus.
[00:25:45.736 --> 00:25:48.037]  Also it came out yesterday, I believe, that...
[00:25:48.936 --> 00:25:59.382]  This individual, Thomas Eric Duncan, first contracted the Ebola virus having helped one of his family members back in Liberia into a taxi.
[00:25:59.562 --> 00:26:02.384]  I believe it was a pregnant woman that was stricken with Ebola.
[00:26:02.864 --> 00:26:05.686]  He helped her into a taxi back in Liberia.
[00:26:05.706 --> 00:26:10.409]  There's the article out of the New York Times, US patient aided pregnant Liberian, then took ill.
[00:26:11.445 --> 00:26:17.232]  So, I mean, almost certainly he knew that he would contract Ebola having done this.
[00:26:17.533 --> 00:26:21.718]  Then he flies to the United States almost immediately to get treatment.
[00:26:22.178 --> 00:26:23.800]  And I've seen questions being asked.
[00:26:24.872 --> 00:26:30.296]  For the people who can afford it, obviously the hospitals in Africa are completely overwhelmed by this.
[00:26:30.396 --> 00:26:35.160]  People who turn up for treatment fearing they're an Ebola victim get turned away.
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:39.122]  We've seen videos where people are just hanging out the back of ambulances.
[00:26:39.143 --> 00:26:41.004]  They can't even make it into the hospital.
[00:26:41.524 --> 00:26:49.830]  No one's really helping them into the hospital because they don't have any beds available in those West African countries, Liberia, Sierra Leone and others.
[00:26:50.731 --> 00:27:06.456]  The question is being asked, you know, if this guy had the money, could he have traveled to the United States in the knowledge that he would get the best health care, having contracted Ebola, knowing that he had done so from this pregnant woman?
[00:27:06.936 --> 00:27:08.196]  Of course, they turned him away.
[00:27:08.216 --> 00:27:12.818]  He told them he had come from Liberia, gave him antibiotics and turned him away.
[00:27:13.538 --> 00:27:15.719]  Now we have the global situation, which is
[00:27:16.741 --> 00:27:19.482]  Just getting increasingly drastic every day.
[00:27:20.002 --> 00:27:25.424]  BBC reports Ebola outbreak five infected every hour in Sierra Leone.
[00:27:25.464 --> 00:27:33.167]  A leading charity has warned that a rate of five new Ebola cases an hour in Sierra Leone means health care demands are far outstripping supply.
[00:27:33.867 --> 00:27:42.670]  Save the Children said there were 765 new cases of Ebola reported in the West African state last week, while there were only 327 beds in the country.
[00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:42.930]  So again,
[00:27:46.021 --> 00:27:47.141]  They're completely overwhelmed.
[00:27:47.181 --> 00:27:52.103]  They can't take in the staggering number of patients that this is impacting.
[00:27:52.163 --> 00:28:06.767]  And here at the end of the article we see the scale of the disease is also, quote, massively under-reported according to the charity because, quote, untold numbers of children are dying anonymously at home or in the streets.
[00:28:07.368 --> 00:28:10.749]  So this figure of Ebola deaths so far, 3,338, of course many more infected, recovered,
[00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:16.451]  Could be many more!
[00:28:17.031 --> 00:28:19.092]  Because a lot of them just aren't being recorded.
[00:28:19.132 --> 00:28:22.113]  A lot of people are just collapsing and dying in the streets.
[00:28:23.474 --> 00:28:27.476]  So if you think it's bad now, I mean, imagine living in those West African countries.
[00:28:27.496 --> 00:28:35.700]  We had top German virologists talking about five million dead in Liberia, in Sierra Leone.
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.905]  Because the virus is just going to burn itself out, according to him.
[00:28:39.965 --> 00:28:41.307]  It's just going to infect everybody.
[00:28:41.347 --> 00:28:43.431]  That's the only point where it's going to actually stop.
[00:28:44.212 --> 00:28:48.139]  Daily Mail Online reports, four weeks to stop Ebola.
[00:28:49.714 --> 00:28:57.923]  34 global organizations will warn International Conference we have one month to stop the epidemic spiraling completely out of control.
[00:28:58.383 --> 00:29:03.589]  The international community has just four weeks to stop the Ebola crisis spiraling completely out of control.
[00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:08.474]  Organizations working in West Africa have today warned.
[00:29:08.995 --> 00:29:10.736]  So again that ties in with the
[00:29:12.265 --> 00:29:12.565]  U.N.
[00:29:12.606 --> 00:29:13.506]  head, the top U.N.
[00:29:13.546 --> 00:29:30.024]  Ebola head, who said that this could be transmissible and it needs to be stopped now, as long as it isn't transmissible, according to our understanding, before it potentially mutates, goes airborne, which of course is a nightmare scenario in his words, U.N.
[00:29:30.044 --> 00:29:34.348]  Ebola chief, virus could mutate and become airborne if it is not controlled.
[00:29:35.009 --> 00:29:37.050]  We're going to get into that and more Ebola news.
[00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:39.691]  We're also going to cover some geopolitical stuff.
[00:29:39.711 --> 00:29:40.871]  We're going to go to your calls.
[00:29:40.891 --> 00:29:41.332]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:42.432 --> 00:29:45.353]  This is the Alex Jones Show live.
[00:29:45.993 --> 00:29:49.075]  Infowars.com for all the breaking news.
[00:29:49.155 --> 00:29:49.755]  Stay tuned.
[00:29:49.975 --> 00:29:51.976]  Lionel coming up in the third hour.
[00:29:52.496 --> 00:29:54.017]  David Knight in studio.
[00:29:54.057 --> 00:29:54.557]  Don't go away.
[00:29:59.638 --> 00:30:02.620]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:06.341]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.383 --> 00:30:18.888]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being, and you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[00:30:19.068 --> 00:30:25.271]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[00:30:25.691 --> 00:30:26.231]  I think so.
[00:30:46.305 --> 00:30:46.645]  I think so.
[00:31:10.885 --> 00:31:16.310]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.

[00:31:22.715 --> 00:31:29.501]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[00:32:08.096 --> 00:32:08.596]  Others don't.
[00:32:10.242 --> 00:32:11.462]  Another major health threat.
[00:32:11.502 --> 00:32:16.404]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:32:16.484 --> 00:32:19.125]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:32:19.145 --> 00:32:25.927]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:32:26.187 --> 00:32:29.048]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:32:29.168 --> 00:32:32.109]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:32:32.129 --> 00:32:34.129]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:36.990]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:42.593]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:32:42.793 --> 00:32:46.296]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:32:46.316 --> 00:32:49.297]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[00:35:49.091 --> 00:35:56.196]  Breaking news now out of NBCNews.com Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan's nephew I had to call CDC.
[00:35:57.577 --> 00:36:01.139]  The first person diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S.
[00:36:01.219 --> 00:36:08.423]  wasn't appropriately treated for suspected infection until after a relative personally called the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
[00:36:08.783 --> 00:36:11.705]  His nephew told NBC News on Wednesday night.
[00:36:12.685 --> 00:36:24.251]  Health officials have acknowledged that Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, was initially sent home from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas when he showed up on September 26 complaining of fever and abdominal pain.
[00:36:24.271 --> 00:36:26.673]  He had to return two days later in an ambulance.
[00:36:27.864 --> 00:36:28.945]  This is what the nephew says.
[00:36:28.965 --> 00:36:37.071]  That was the day, quote, I called CDC to get some actions taken because I was concerned for his life and he wasn't getting the appropriate care.
[00:36:37.532 --> 00:36:41.915]  Duncan's nephew, Josephus Weeks, told NBC News on Wednesday night.
[00:36:42.476 --> 00:36:53.844]  So again, we know before this guy, Thomas Eric Duncan, arrived in Dallas, he had helped an Ebola victim, a pregnant woman, who subsequently died from the Ebola virus,
[00:36:54.705 --> 00:36:57.547]  Into a taxi to get her to the hospital.
[00:36:58.548 --> 00:37:12.098]  He then contracted Ebola, flew to the United States via I think it was Brussels and Washington Dulles, walks into a Dallas hospital and again they give him antibiotics even though he tells them he just came in from Liberia.
[00:37:12.518 --> 00:37:15.401]  He has the early onset symptoms of Ebola.
[00:37:16.101 --> 00:37:29.028]  So now we're learning that his nephew had to directly call the CDC to warn that he was a potential Ebola victim until he could actually be isolated and get proper treatment.
[00:37:29.048 --> 00:37:29.729]  I mean, who knows?
[00:37:30.389 --> 00:37:32.230]  They gave him antibiotics the first time.
[00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:35.292]  Would they have sent him away again into the general population?
[00:37:36.252 --> 00:37:39.394]  If this nephew hadn't have called the CDC.
[00:37:39.474 --> 00:37:43.396]  So, I mean, yesterday it was apparent that they completely dropped the ball.
[00:37:43.617 --> 00:37:45.458]  I mean, the screw-up gets even worse.
[00:37:45.518 --> 00:37:46.658]  Now we have the denials.
[00:37:47.419 --> 00:37:49.720]  NIH director on Ebola screw-up.
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:52.362]  I think we just need to put that behind us.
[00:37:52.902 --> 00:37:56.925]  He told MSNBC's Morning Joe earlier today.
[00:37:57.025 --> 00:38:03.869]  So again, move along nothing to see here as potential new cases are being reported.
[00:38:04.926 --> 00:38:07.727]  Let's go to some of your calls on Ebola.
[00:38:08.367 --> 00:38:10.348]  Gabrielle in Michigan, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:38:12.829 --> 00:38:14.050]  Yeah, hey Paul.
[00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:34.558]  Speaking of nothing to see here, I wanted to put up a statement that they're saying that you don't show symptoms until later and they're screening people for fevers at the airport and you're not going to have any symptoms if you have it later coming into the States and
[00:38:35.249 --> 00:38:37.081]  Then have a full-blown episode.
[00:38:38.339 --> 00:38:38.999]  Well, precisely.
[00:38:39.039 --> 00:38:49.026]  I mean, there was an article out of Defence One yesterday which made the point that screening people at airports is completely useless because they cannot show these symptoms for days.
[00:38:49.406 --> 00:38:57.752]  We're told that Ebola can only be contracted when the symptoms start to be shown by the sufferer, but they can go days without showing any of these symptoms.
[00:38:57.792 --> 00:38:59.533]  There you see the article out of Defence One.
[00:38:59.913 --> 00:39:07.759]  There's really no way to screen for Ebola at airports, which is the only measure that they are now apparently putting in place as of
[00:39:08.579 --> 00:39:18.472]  Yesterday, Customs, Border Patrol and flight attendants are being told to watch for people with signs of fever, with signs of symptoms potentially linked with Ebola.
[00:39:18.932 --> 00:39:25.460]  Why that wasn't already in place, I don't know, but even now it is in place, it's really going to have little effect whatsoever.
[00:39:26.541 --> 00:39:29.302]  No flights have been cancelled as a result of this.
[00:39:29.342 --> 00:39:37.604]  It doesn't appear as if that's likely to be the case, even though several other major airlines across the world cancelled flights from Liberia weeks ago.
[00:39:38.004 --> 00:39:45.446]  Of course, that's more difficult to do in the case of the US, because those flights aren't coming in directly from Liberia or from Sierra Leone.
[00:39:45.806 --> 00:39:52.188]  But there's been no indication whatsoever that the government, that the health authorities, are planning to do that.
[00:39:52.288 --> 00:39:53.208]  So, again,
[00:39:54.108 --> 00:40:00.713]  This screening of temperature at airports is pretty much pointless because they could have Ebola and not show the symptoms for days.
[00:40:00.733 --> 00:40:01.694]  Thanks for your call.
[00:40:02.354 --> 00:40:04.596]  Martinez in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:40:05.977 --> 00:40:11.682]  Yes, I'm kind of dovetailing this in Ebola with secession.
[00:40:12.963 --> 00:40:20.168]  I think, I mean, ever since I was a kid I was an advocate of secession, but it's always split in a political, you know, fashion.
[00:40:20.889 --> 00:40:23.871]  Never have we had the chance
[00:40:24.511 --> 00:40:40.043]  And the view of our own federal government blatantly not caring for our safety and essentially sending us off into war while there's an outbreak going on, telling us that we're, you know, we're okay.
[00:40:40.103 --> 00:40:41.384]  And of course it's not happening.
[00:40:42.345 --> 00:40:49.510]  It's time for really for us to start taking responsibility for our own states and our own homes and communities.
[00:40:50.123 --> 00:41:02.810]  Because the federal government truly isn't going to be there, so really my question is, you know, should we use this as our motive to really say this has nothing to do with politics?
[00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:16.537]  This has the pure, honest view of safety, and this is why we as states, and we as Texas, should break away, bring our own troops back, secure our own borders.
[00:41:17.502 --> 00:41:20.503]  Um, protect ourselves, because the federal government isn't doing it.
[00:41:21.744 --> 00:41:22.384]  Well, precisely.
[00:41:22.404 --> 00:41:32.728]  I mean, even in this one case alone, the CDC, after months of telling us they were prepared for a potential Ebola outbreak in the United States, they failed completely.
[00:41:33.088 --> 00:41:37.870]  More so the health authorities in Texas at the Presbyterian Hospital, but again,
[00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:44.436]  You know, the CDC is now complaining that it's underfunded, that it doesn't have the capacity to deal with any of this.
[00:41:44.476 --> 00:41:48.740]  That's only come out now, after Ebola has already arrived in the United States.
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:52.423]  That probably should have been a big issue two months ago, but it wasn't.
[00:41:53.404 --> 00:41:53.864]  So again...
[00:41:55.003 --> 00:42:18.779]  It's a good argument for secession in terms of localizing health authorities and dealing with this on a more decentralized basis which would probably be more effective rather than this federal response which again always seems to be botched, always seems to be in the pursuit of monetary or political power objectives in terms of this medical martial law infrastructure that the CDC has set up
[00:42:19.239 --> 00:42:22.282]  Particularly over the past 10 to 15 years.
[00:42:22.362 --> 00:42:25.885]  So that's a good argument for devolving power locally.
[00:42:25.945 --> 00:42:26.605]  Thanks for the call.
[00:42:26.625 --> 00:42:29.988]  We're going to go to Tion in Arizona.
[00:42:30.028 --> 00:42:30.829]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:36.093]  Yes, I wanted to bring up the point, first of all, thanks for taking my call.
[00:42:36.513 --> 00:42:44.700]  But I wanted to bring up the point of the Black Coffins, Aaron Dyke's article in 2010 about the FEMA Black Coffins.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:45.701]  I mean, I just wonder
[00:42:46.638 --> 00:42:50.390]  You know, how soon are they going to be filling us Americans up in those coffins?
[00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:52.476]  And it just scares me.
[00:42:54.771 --> 00:43:13.749]  As I said yesterday, I think the threat of the hysteria is going to be more visceral and potentially, you know, exploited by the Feds as the threat of the virus itself because it only takes, you know, perhaps a dozen cases across America in different states for this to really get hyped up.
[00:43:14.229 --> 00:43:15.130]  Of course, they've had 3,300 cases.
[00:43:17.472 --> 00:43:23.036]  In West Africa they're talking about 1.2 million by the end of January.
[00:43:23.576 --> 00:43:30.081]  Imagine if there were just a dozen or two dozen cases in America in different states.
[00:43:30.421 --> 00:43:41.469]  I mean this this would engender some kind of panic and I know the CDC is well aware of that so as I said it's about managing the hysteria as much as it is about managing the actual virus.
[00:43:42.009 --> 00:43:45.492]  Obviously if it goes airborne which a lot of major health professionals
[00:43:46.252 --> 00:43:49.315]  The UN head of the Ebola response team is now warning about them.
[00:43:49.335 --> 00:43:52.438]  That's another nightmare scenario, as he called it, altogether.
[00:43:53.439 --> 00:44:04.583]  But we also had the article a couple of days ago now, which was that the CDC advised funeral homes in the United States to prepare for an Ebola outbreak.
[00:44:04.623 --> 00:44:10.726]  They were telling funeral workers not to conduct autopsies or embalm corpses.
[00:44:10.766 --> 00:44:12.826]  They were giving them a list of recommendations.
[00:44:13.267 --> 00:44:16.208]  You see the article up on InfoWars.com.
[00:44:17.711 --> 00:44:20.412]  They're well aware that this could really escalate.
[00:44:20.432 --> 00:44:22.533]  That's obviously why they're talking to funeral homes.
[00:44:23.333 --> 00:44:25.894]  Hopefully it remains isolated.
[00:44:25.934 --> 00:44:41.319]  I think the good news is the fact that those ambulance workers that brought the Ebola victim into the hospital in Dallas were not infected with the virus, so that suggests that it's not airborne, at least in this case, and I hope that remains so.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:43.180]  But thanks for the call.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.141]  We're going to go to Tom in Idaho.
[00:44:45.161 --> 00:44:45.661]  Go ahead, Tom.
[00:44:47.062 --> 00:44:48.343]  Hey Paul, good morning to you.
[00:44:48.363 --> 00:44:49.524]  Morning.
[00:44:50.445 --> 00:44:54.249]  Hey, have you guys heard of this fire chat yet going on in Hong Kong?
[00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:55.950]  No, what's that?
[00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:57.592]  Go ahead and explain that to the listeners.
[00:44:58.392 --> 00:45:06.740]  Man, they have got a free app that this guy has created that you don't need Wi-Fi or hotspot to communicate to your phone through texting.
[00:45:07.221 --> 00:45:13.066]  These protesters are using this app to communicate and organize their protests
[00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:18.351]  And 100,000 apps in one day this creator got downloaded.
[00:45:19.011 --> 00:45:20.332]  It's spreading fast.
[00:45:21.892 --> 00:45:22.732]  Look into it.
[00:45:22.873 --> 00:45:27.234]  I've looked it up on the internet and gotten as much information as I can.
[00:45:27.274 --> 00:45:31.216]  It's hit a couple of mainstream news article feeds.
[00:45:31.296 --> 00:45:33.176]  Give us some credence and see where it goes.
[00:45:33.217 --> 00:45:34.117]  There you go, right there.
[00:45:34.824 --> 00:45:35.804]  That's out of Forbes.
[00:45:35.845 --> 00:45:39.366]  Fire Chat prepares encryption feature as it drives Hong Kong protests.
[00:45:39.726 --> 00:45:41.487]  Yeah, I briefly saw this this morning.
[00:45:41.507 --> 00:45:42.528]  I didn't get into the details.
[00:45:43.108 --> 00:45:48.231]  Twitter helped power the Arab Spring in 2012, which of course we also know was hijacked.
[00:45:48.571 --> 00:45:56.555]  Now the pro-democracy demonstrations setting Hong Kong in motion are being driven by a new kind of mobile technology, an underground messaging app called Fire Chat.
[00:45:57.538 --> 00:46:04.664]  So, yeah, as far as I understand it, this doesn't need Wi-Fi that it says here, or a carrier connection to the chat to one another on the app.
[00:46:04.924 --> 00:46:09.207]  They only need another person with the same app within a 70 meter radius.
[00:46:09.267 --> 00:46:16.293]  That's useful in Hong Kong, where the influx of thousands of protesters have made cellular connections sluggish or non-existent.
[00:46:16.813 --> 00:46:19.275]  So the technology, I guess it's some kind of
[00:46:20.643 --> 00:46:32.350]  radio technology or some kind of extended Bluetooth within a 70 meter radius they can communicate with each other without the need for Wi-Fi or cellular connections.
[00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:40.375]  That would be interesting to see where that originated from because there are a lot of questions which we'll delve into later in the show.
[00:46:41.627 --> 00:46:52.684]  About whether this Hong Kong uprising, given that it is, from the outset, looking in, genuine, I mean, Beijing has openly announced they're going to hand-select the Hong Kong politicians for the 2017 election.
[00:46:54.963 --> 00:47:04.933]  Basically re-imposing Chinese control over the area after Britain handed it back in 1997, but with those protections for political free speech in elections.
[00:47:05.713 --> 00:47:19.126]  So it seems to be a genuine uprising looking in from the outside, but then you get into the evidence now of who is funding it, which we're going to get into later, and it could indeed be a case of another colour revolution like we saw in Ukraine.
[00:47:20.029 --> 00:47:33.256]  That at least it was hijacked by these organizations such as the National Endowment for Democracy that we've seen before subverting and infiltrating these mass protest movements as we saw with the Arab Spring back two, three years ago.
[00:47:33.737 --> 00:47:36.438]  It could again be the case in Hong Kong.
[00:47:36.999 --> 00:47:47.765]  Not to say that those grievances aren't genuine that the initial protest movement sprang up out of in that area, but it's something we're definitely going to dig into later in the show.
[00:47:48.405 --> 00:47:49.269]  Thanks for the call though.
[00:47:49.289 --> 00:47:51.196]  We're going to go to Ben in Missouri.
[00:47:51.216 --> 00:47:51.838]  Go ahead, Ben.
[00:47:53.384 --> 00:47:54.087]  Hey, how's it going?
[00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:56.391]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:47:56.431 --> 00:47:58.413]  I just wanted to say a couple things.
[00:47:58.453 --> 00:48:08.360]  First of all, my wife is a pediatric nurse and she is going to forward me the email, but she's been briefed and all of the employees have been briefed on Ebola.
[00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:13.563]  I know that that's not news or anything, but it's definitely, you know, it's true.
[00:48:13.663 --> 00:48:15.084]  It seems like it's coming.
[00:48:16.265 --> 00:48:19.508]  To me, the saddest part about this entire thing is
[00:48:20.982 --> 00:48:23.964]  I have this feeling that this is a drill.
[00:48:24.084 --> 00:48:32.289]  This is a live drill that's being run at the expense of the American people to see whether or not the government can contain a bioweapon.
[00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:37.473]  You know, the CDC, all the different government entities coming together to see if they can do it.
[00:48:38.533 --> 00:48:41.696]  And it's going to be done at the expense of the American people, just like everything else.
[00:48:43.357 --> 00:48:45.078]  It's crazy that I could even really
[00:48:45.785 --> 00:48:55.484]  I think that that's happened, that that couldn't be the case, but, you know, based on the criminals that run things in this country, it wouldn't shock me, it wouldn't surprise me, and I think that that might be the case.
[00:48:56.857 --> 00:49:04.663]  That's the question that John Rappaport is asking in an article on PrisonPlanet.com today, tracking Ebola contacts, calling the surveillance state.
[00:49:04.703 --> 00:49:10.547]  He says, quote, this is a perfect way for surveillance advocates to win love for their machine.
[00:49:11.328 --> 00:49:15.150]  We told you the NSA was absolutely necessary in order to protect the American people.
[00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.971]  Here's the proof.
[00:49:16.511 --> 00:49:22.235]  We can hunt and find carriers of the dreaded virus, and you and your children will be safe.
[00:49:22.356 --> 00:49:23.757]  So, as you mentioned,
[00:49:24.497 --> 00:49:38.812]  Whether this turns out to be limited, which, you know, in all probability it will, hopefully it will, they could still hijack it to beef up this infrastructure of medical martial law that really came into the fore after 9-11.
[00:49:39.252 --> 00:49:45.759]  Of course, with the anthrax attacks, which led directly back to Fort Detrick, they blamed a Patsy.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:52.502]  That all completely unraveled, but they used it again to beef up this medical martial law infrastructure.
[00:49:52.542 --> 00:50:12.269]  So, you know, the federal government tends to like to exploit these opportunities, never let a good crisis go to waste, in the words of Rahm Emanuel, to call forth the surveillance state, as John Rappaport says in his article, and that's precisely what we see unfolding.
[00:50:12.289 --> 00:50:13.009]  Thanks for the call.
[00:50:13.249 --> 00:50:14.910]  Jeff in Georgia, go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.221]  Oh, Paul, thanks for taking the call.
[00:50:19.002 --> 00:50:20.043]  Yeah, two things.
[00:50:20.163 --> 00:50:26.808]  Before we get started on the Ebola thing, I just wanted to remind, because of you guys, Robert Tosh Palmley, his 11 questions.
[00:50:27.108 --> 00:50:33.333]  If you go back and look at those 11 questions, I think that you'll find that almost all of them have been answered by now just by the actions of the federal government.
[00:50:34.073 --> 00:50:37.116]  As far as the Ebola thing, you know, is this the October surprise?
[00:50:37.136 --> 00:50:40.258]  And of course, one of the many that these guys are kind of springing at us from all areas.
[00:50:41.011 --> 00:50:51.773]  Open borders, open airline flights from Africa into the United States, and Ebola breaks out, and can we get this thing cranked up enough to scare everybody away from the polls by November 5th?
[00:50:51.853 --> 00:50:58.475]  And if not this year, by 2016, would it mean that you would have to have your Ebola vaccination before you could vote?
[00:50:58.495 --> 00:50:59.775]  Because you're going to be in a public space.
[00:50:59.795 --> 00:51:01.536]  That's an interesting point.
[00:51:01.556 --> 00:51:03.556]  We'll be back with more of your calls after the break.
[00:51:03.576 --> 00:51:04.936]  David Knight in studio coming up.
[00:51:05.156 --> 00:51:06.657]  InfoWars.com.
[00:51:06.697 --> 00:51:07.337]  Stay right there.

[00:51:40.966 --> 00:51:42.467]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:51:42.787 --> 00:51:44.068]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[00:51:44.428 --> 00:51:46.769]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:49.111]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[00:51:49.551 --> 00:51:53.594]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[00:52:09.235 --> 00:52:11.817]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:52:12.077 --> 00:52:16.940]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:52:17.201 --> 00:52:25.086]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:52:25.326 --> 00:52:29.629]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:52:29.849 --> 00:52:33.652]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:52:33.812 --> 00:52:39.516]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:52:39.756 --> 00:52:42.538]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:52:42.918 --> 00:52:48.142]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:52:48.282 --> 00:52:56.407]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alextoday for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[00:52:56.467 --> 00:52:56.647]  That's 866-229-0927.
[00:53:06.113 --> 00:53:10.895]  The human body is extraordinary.
[00:53:11.215 --> 00:53:15.196]  Despite all the stresses we inflict upon it, it still works hard to stay in balance.
[00:53:15.396 --> 00:53:20.398]  Thousands upon thousands of people rely upon hardened body extract to help their body stay balanced.

[00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:38.023]  It's the Alex Jones Show, live Thursday, October 2nd edition.
[00:54:38.123 --> 00:54:41.206]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson, filling in for Alex Jones.
[00:54:41.546 --> 00:54:44.308]  He'll be calling in at some point, we hope, during the show.
[00:54:44.368 --> 00:54:51.273]  Coming up in the next hour, David Knight in studio and Lionel of Lionel Media coming up in the third hour.
[00:54:51.333 --> 00:54:52.154]  He's always fun.
[00:54:52.254 --> 00:54:55.837]  We're going to discuss media narratives, Ebola and a lot more.
[00:54:56.357 --> 00:55:06.433]  There's a doctor actually in Atlanta, we're going to get this clip maybe next segment, who's protesting against what he says are CDC lies with the Ebola situation.
[00:55:06.473 --> 00:55:11.381]  He actually dressed up in a hazmat suit, went to Atlanta International Airport.
[00:55:11.881 --> 00:55:12.962]  Good afternoon there, Paul.
[00:55:13.002 --> 00:55:16.445]  That's some fine work you're doing over there at InfoWars.
[00:55:16.866 --> 00:55:22.551]  Now I'm going to make three points and I'm going to make it very clear and make it quick.
[00:55:37.833 --> 00:55:41.714]  Bill Gates and Warren Buffett are up to their necks in this stuff.
[00:55:42.074 --> 00:55:43.634]  They're trying to clear out Africa.
[00:55:43.714 --> 00:55:46.795]  We know that America is being dissolved in a vat of political acid.
[00:55:47.355 --> 00:55:49.975]  And China has been moving into Africa for years.
[00:55:50.475 --> 00:55:56.357]  So this is a way to get them, you know, basically startled, stop their progress, etc.
[00:55:56.417 --> 00:56:03.458]  Bill Gates said the other night that this is not going to be the last epidemic.
[00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:05.811]  Bill Gates is up to his neck in this.
[00:56:05.871 --> 00:56:09.074]  We've been attacking vaccines now for what, five years?
[00:56:09.634 --> 00:56:16.700]  Alex has been doing it for forever, and we know full well we've put a huge dent in their money machine.
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.301]  I'll tell you something, folks.
[00:56:18.802 --> 00:56:21.063]  What we're looking at here is a false flag.
[00:56:21.083 --> 00:56:26.908]  The CDC lost smallpox, a truckload of smallpox, so they had to cover that up with Ebola.
[00:56:27.699 --> 00:56:37.745]  Now, Ebola is not going to affect us the way it does in Africa because we have fresh water, fresh food, vitamin C, vitamins, and especially we have Alex Jones and all his products and Dr. Group.
[00:56:38.185 --> 00:56:40.266]  But I want people to be on board here.
[00:56:40.967 --> 00:56:43.268]  The gentleman mentioned the October surprise.
[00:56:43.328 --> 00:56:46.190]  We've heard Robert Tosh Plumlee talk about false flags.
[00:56:46.930 --> 00:56:48.711]  You listen to these people speak.
[00:56:48.911 --> 00:56:50.012]  You look at their writings.
[00:56:50.712 --> 00:56:55.275]  Pay attention to silent weapons for quiet wars, quiet wars for silent weapons.
[00:56:55.922 --> 00:57:03.805]  When they tell you that superbugs are coming and they're here, you better believe they are not going to lose the money.
[00:57:03.985 --> 00:57:10.308]  You know, Rockefeller, you've got Rockefeller, you've got Kissinger all over the place, you've got Brzezinski out there blabbing his mouth.
[00:57:10.888 --> 00:57:14.349]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is how they roll.
[00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:19.191]  And I tweeted, what bioweapon are they going to release on us next?
[00:57:19.492 --> 00:57:20.352]  Three months ago.
[00:57:21.252 --> 00:57:24.213]  And within 30 days, we had Ebola.
[00:57:24.614 --> 00:57:25.474]  And there you have it.
[00:57:27.213 --> 00:57:43.983]  Well, it's interesting because actually Louis Farrakhan of all people came out today and cited Dick Cheney's Rebuilding America's Defenses document where he said that, you know, germ warfare, bio warfare would improve to the point where it could target individual races.
[00:57:44.263 --> 00:57:47.125]  Obviously, I don't think that's the case with Ebola because we've had a lot of
[00:57:47.905 --> 00:57:53.670]  American health workers that have been infected with it that have come back, but definitely that's something that they had in the offing.
[00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:58.713]  In terms of Africa, as you said, China's got huge investment in that country.
[00:57:59.074 --> 00:58:05.719]  They're trying to absorb it into the BRICS financial structure that is destined to take on America.
[00:58:06.459 --> 00:58:08.101]  And that's the case.
[00:58:08.161 --> 00:58:13.024]  In Africa there's a lot of rallying back between America and China.
[00:58:14.345 --> 00:58:18.228]  China has investments in Africa which dwarf those of America.
[00:58:18.268 --> 00:58:23.933]  We had these troops sent in by Obama recently to deal with the Ebola outbreak.
[00:58:23.973 --> 00:58:27.936]  A lot of questions being asked about what good troops would do in such a situation.
[00:58:28.877 --> 00:58:35.222]  And again, a lot of information suggests that it could have been an undercover attempt to subvert, to infiltrate Africa.
[00:58:36.062 --> 00:58:41.204]  In the guise of fighting Ebola when in reality it was a geopolitical move against China.
[00:58:41.244 --> 00:58:43.744]  So we'll get into that and more after the break.
[00:58:43.884 --> 00:58:45.825]  David Knight's coming up in studio next.
[00:58:45.905 --> 00:58:47.165]  It's the Alex Jones Show Live.
[00:58:47.185 --> 00:58:48.406]  Stay tuned.

[00:59:26.324 --> 00:59:27.125]  DNA Force.
[00:59:30.307 --> 00:59:33.808]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:59:33.948 --> 00:59:37.930]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:39.690]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:47.613]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:59:47.873 --> 00:59:48.713]  But for how long?

[01:00:03.226 --> 01:00:05.132]  Waging war on corruption.

[01:00:16.328 --> 01:00:16.948]  Big Brother.
[01:00:17.629 --> 01:00:18.650]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:19.390 --> 01:00:20.491]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:21.152 --> 01:00:21.952]  You want answers?
[01:00:22.733 --> 01:00:23.613]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:24.274 --> 01:00:27.897]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:28.477 --> 01:00:32.540]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:40.956 --> 01:00:43.678]  We're back, second hour of the Alex Jones Show live.
[01:00:43.919 --> 01:00:48.603]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex, going to be joined by David Knight in a second.
[01:00:49.283 --> 01:00:56.590]  First though, let's go to this clip out of Atlanta which has been reported Dr. Don's Ebola protection suit to protest CDC.
[01:00:56.650 --> 01:01:01.154]  He's calling the CDC liars for their handling of this Ebola situation.
[01:01:01.474 --> 01:01:02.315]  Let's go to the clip.
[01:01:03.295 --> 01:01:04.896]  My name is Dr. Gil Mobley.
[01:01:05.056 --> 01:01:05.676]  I'm an MD.
[01:01:06.176 --> 01:01:09.057]  I'm an emergency trauma physician and a microbiologist.
[01:01:09.217 --> 01:01:13.279]  I'm here this morning in the Atlanta airport to put out a public call for action.
[01:01:13.619 --> 01:01:19.281]  I believe the CDC is being dishonest with us about the propensity of importing Ebola cases to the United States.
[01:01:19.961 --> 01:01:29.607]  Once this disease consumes every third world country, and surely it will, because they lack the same basic infrastructure as Sierra Leone and Liberia, it will devour these countries.
[01:01:29.947 --> 01:01:34.250]  At that point, we will be importing clusters of Ebola on a daily basis.
[01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:39.954]  That will overwhelm any advanced country's ability to contain the clusters with isolation and quarantine.
[01:01:40.534 --> 01:01:41.635]  That spells bad news.
[01:01:41.995 --> 01:01:46.138]  The CDC last week said the chance of importing Ebola was infinitesimal.
[01:01:46.918 --> 01:01:50.000]  And that was the same day the patient was misdiagnosed in Dallas.
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.381]  The CDC is derelict in their duty.
[01:01:53.282 --> 01:01:55.984]  Yesterday I came through International Customs in the Atlanta airport.
[01:01:56.464 --> 01:02:01.027]  The only question they asked arriving passengers is if they had tobacco or alcohol.
[01:02:01.467 --> 01:02:02.648]  That is dereliction of duty.
[01:02:02.808 --> 01:02:04.789]  The CDC is asleep at the wheel.
[01:02:07.739 --> 01:02:10.641]  Protesting against the CDC at Atlanta Airport.
[01:02:10.721 --> 01:02:23.570]  As I mentioned earlier, the CNN news crew who came back from Liberia basically told the US Customs and Border Patrol that they had been in Liberia in close quarters with people infected with Ebola.
[01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:25.111]  They were reporting on the situation.
[01:02:26.172 --> 01:02:28.134]  Basically, Border Patrol were not interested.
[01:02:28.194 --> 01:02:28.874]  They did nothing.
[01:02:28.914 --> 01:02:29.955]  They asked no questions.
[01:02:29.995 --> 01:02:31.076]  They took no tests.
[01:02:31.456 --> 01:02:33.458]  This was a couple of days before the outbreak.
[01:02:33.958 --> 01:02:41.545]  And as this doctor said, the CDC said it was an infinitesimal probability that the United States would see a case of this.
[01:02:42.525 --> 01:02:46.449]  Now it's arrived, so we've got anger protests against the CDC.
[01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:52.656]  David Knight joins us in studio for the latest on what the CDC is saying about the Ebola outbreak in Africa.
[01:02:52.736 --> 01:02:53.817]  David, what's the latest?
[01:02:54.217 --> 01:03:01.044]  Well now, Paul, they're saying that it's going to possibly reach anywhere from a half a million to one and a half million cases in West Africa by January.
[01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:04.451]  That's just three or four months away.
[01:03:05.472 --> 01:03:11.336]  That is a huge number if you look at the population because that's just two countries where it's the worst right now.
[01:03:11.436 --> 01:03:13.698]  Sierra Leone and Liberia.
[01:03:14.179 --> 01:03:18.402]  Those two countries have a combined population of only about 10 million people.
[01:03:18.903 --> 01:03:20.784]  So you're looking at a very high percentage.
[01:03:20.804 --> 01:03:21.745]  You're looking at about 5% to 20%
[01:03:24.327 --> 01:03:31.213]  Of the population the CDC is projecting is going to come down with Ebola by January in those West African countries.
[01:03:31.634 --> 01:03:42.223]  And so that really kind of puts all this that we've been hearing from Rick Perry and the CDC about how don't worry we have a wonderful medical infrastructure here compared to West Africa.
[01:03:42.263 --> 01:03:42.764]  Yes we do.
[01:03:42.884 --> 01:03:44.465]  We also have a much larger population.
[01:03:45.222 --> 01:03:48.424]  We do not have infinite resources to handle anything.
[01:03:48.484 --> 01:04:00.572]  So what happens when you start to get a massive exponential increase in cases and you don't have the hospital staff, you don't have the capacity to deal with this?
[01:04:00.732 --> 01:04:04.635]  Because right now it is still growing exponentially.
[01:04:04.655 --> 01:04:05.595]  We've got some other figures.
[01:04:05.615 --> 01:04:08.257]  We're going to break down those figures in detail coming from the CDC.
[01:04:08.277 --> 01:04:09.538]  We've also got some other information
[01:04:10.158 --> 01:04:19.147]  That I think people would like to know and some other areas we've got Californians are now going to be able to get their relatives disarmed with a new law that's been passed in California.
[01:04:19.648 --> 01:04:28.616]  The US government has relaxed the standards on killing civilians with drones in areas that are supposedly affected by ISIS.
[01:04:29.117 --> 01:04:34.122]  So we have some interest and also there's another story out of Hong Kong is that's building to a conflict.
[01:04:35.022 --> 01:04:46.108]  There's a story out of the Wall Street Journal talking about how there's a Christian subtext to this protest besides the heavy-handedness of China saying that they're going to pick who the candidates are.
[01:04:47.615 --> 01:04:49.096]  And we'll be back with that and more.
[01:04:49.116 --> 01:04:54.919]  We've also got Lionel from Lionel Media coming up in the third hour to discuss a host of subjects.
[01:04:55.039 --> 01:04:56.540]  More on Ebola coming up.
[01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:57.560]  More of your calls.
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.401]  David Knight in studio.
[01:04:59.801 --> 01:05:01.462]  This is the Alex Jones Show live.

[01:05:15.692 --> 01:05:23.759]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:05:23.859 --> 01:05:28.923]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:05:28.943 --> 01:05:29.944]  DNA Force.

[01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:36.950]  DNA Force.
[01:05:40.307 --> 01:05:43.808]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:05:43.968 --> 01:05:47.929]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:48.229 --> 01:05:49.689]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:05:50.009 --> 01:05:57.591]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:05:57.871 --> 01:05:58.712]  But for how long?

[01:07:09.666 --> 01:07:16.714]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:07:16.834 --> 01:07:18.997]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:07:19.197 --> 01:07:24.302]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:07:24.462 --> 01:07:29.448]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:07:29.628 --> 01:07:32.690]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:36.812]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:07:37.012 --> 01:07:41.274]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:07:41.334 --> 01:07:51.359]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:54.081]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs,
[01:07:54.281 --> 01:07:57.882]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:58.002 --> 01:07:59.423]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:38.174 --> 01:08:41.875]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show Live Thursday, October 2nd edition.
[01:08:42.255 --> 01:08:44.316]  Here's an article out of WorldNetDaily.
[01:08:44.336 --> 01:08:49.457]  We're going to talk about Obama, or President Obola, as Michael Savage is calling him.
[01:08:49.937 --> 01:08:56.559]  Obola has now entered the US because of President Obama's open borders policy, charged talk radio host Michael Savage.
[01:08:57.239 --> 01:09:08.767]  Referring to the Commander-in-Chief as President Ebola, Savage said on his National Syndicator Show Wednesday, the quote-only solution is zero travel in and out of West Africa for any American.
[01:09:08.827 --> 01:09:16.051]  You let nobody in from a country where you have a raging epidemic, he said, emphasising microbes do not discriminate.
[01:09:16.131 --> 01:09:20.274]  You isolate, you quarantine an entire nation if necessary.
[01:09:20.334 --> 01:09:21.915]  That's what Michael Savage is saying.
[01:09:22.556 --> 01:09:24.717]  He's an epidemiologist, isn't he, Paul?
[01:09:24.917 --> 01:09:25.458]  That's right, yeah.
[01:09:26.178 --> 01:09:26.739]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:09:26.799 --> 01:09:27.980]  Doctorate in Epidemiology.
[01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:29.642]  So, that's what he's saying.
[01:09:29.963 --> 01:09:41.516]  Also, we had a strange story which you mentioned, David, just during the break, which was this September 16th meeting that Obama had with the CDC and this incident which happened in the elevator.
[01:09:41.556 --> 01:09:42.097]  Explain that.
[01:09:42.810 --> 01:09:54.298]  Yeah, I got a call from Richard Reeves here at Infowars and he noticed this connection and he said everybody is talking about this being essentially the final straw for the Director of the Secret Service when she got fired.
[01:09:54.338 --> 01:10:01.923]  He went to visit the CDC in Atlanta and while he's on an elevator there was a private security guard that they found had a gun that the Secret Service didn't know about.
[01:10:01.963 --> 01:10:05.526]  After they found out about it, it was a huge obvious breach in protocol for them.
[01:10:06.406 --> 01:10:14.192]  But what nobody is talking about is the fact that Obama visited the CDC on September the 16th to talk about Ebola.
[01:10:14.732 --> 01:10:17.794]  At the same time, he's giving us assurances, don't worry, it's not going to come here.
[01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:20.616]  So that's an interesting data point, I think.
[01:10:21.057 --> 01:10:34.947]  Along with the other disinformation that we're hearing just yesterday, that Josh Earnest, the White House Press Secretary, told reporters that they have screening processes and procedures in place at our borders.
[01:10:35.327 --> 01:10:36.187]  They don't have that.
[01:10:36.227 --> 01:10:38.328]  Anybody that travels knows that they don't have it.
[01:10:38.368 --> 01:10:43.009]  And they had a doctor, very, very angry about that, who did a protest.
[01:10:43.369 --> 01:10:43.969]  Where was that?
[01:10:44.009 --> 01:10:46.390]  Yeah, that was at the Atlanta airport, where the CDC is.
[01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:54.492]  He donned a protective suit and wrote on the suit, CDC is lying.
[01:10:54.652 --> 01:10:55.912]  And we have a clip of that, too.
[01:10:55.972 --> 01:10:58.052]  We played that in just the last segment when we had the news.
[01:10:58.072 --> 01:11:00.313]  A lot of people don't get that.
[01:11:00.333 --> 01:11:01.373]  They get local news on that.
[01:11:01.433 --> 01:11:03.314]  Let's go ahead and roll that clip again.
[01:11:04.754 --> 01:11:06.335]  My name is Dr. Gil Mobley.
[01:11:06.515 --> 01:11:07.116]  I'm an MD.
[01:11:07.616 --> 01:11:10.518]  I'm an emergency trauma physician and a microbiologist.
[01:11:10.658 --> 01:11:14.720]  I'm here this morning at the Atlanta airport to put out a public call for action.
[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:20.724]  I believe the CDC is being dishonest with us about the propensity of importing Ebola cases to the United States.
[01:11:21.404 --> 01:11:31.048]  Once this disease consumes every third world country, and surely it will, because they lack the same basic infrastructure as Sierra Leone and Liberia, it will devour these countries.
[01:11:31.248 --> 01:11:35.690]  And at that point, we will be importing clusters of Ebola on a daily basis.
[01:11:35.970 --> 01:11:41.392]  That will overwhelm any advanced country's ability to contain the clusters in isolation and quarantine.
[01:11:41.973 --> 01:11:43.053]  That spells bad news.
[01:11:43.433 --> 01:11:47.555]  The CDC last week said the chance of importing Ebola was infinitesimal.
[01:11:48.355 --> 01:11:51.456]  And that was the same day the patient was misdiagnosed in Dallas.
[01:11:51.796 --> 01:11:53.817]  The CDC is derelict in their duty.
[01:11:54.738 --> 01:11:57.419]  Yesterday I came through International Customs in the Atlanta airport.
[01:11:57.919 --> 01:12:02.460]  The only question they asked arriving passengers is if they had tobacco or alcohol.
[01:12:02.901 --> 01:12:04.081]  That is dereliction of duty.
[01:12:04.241 --> 01:12:06.222]  The CDC is asleep at the wheel.
[01:12:07.918 --> 01:12:09.059]  My name is Dr... And that's the thing.
[01:12:09.099 --> 01:12:09.940]  Very interesting, yeah.
[01:12:10.361 --> 01:12:23.253]  And I mean, as I said earlier, these CNN reporters that have been to Liberia, they've been in close quarters with these infected, exposed Ebola victims, they told the Customs and Border people directly, look, we've just been in Liberia.
[01:12:23.914 --> 01:12:27.999]  You need to do some tests on us just to make sure, and they ran no tests whatsoever.
[01:12:28.019 --> 01:12:30.342]  I mean, you know, I came in last week.
[01:12:30.382 --> 01:12:42.478]  They were certain to get my biometric fingerprints, but nobody who came through got tested for any kind of temperature, even though back in 2009 with the swine flu outbreak, literally when we landed,
[01:12:43.058 --> 01:12:49.080]  In China, they boarded the plane in hazmat suits before you could get off the plane, scanned everybody's temperatures.
[01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:56.042]  So, I mean, David, do you agree that the CDC is basically asleep at the wheel, despite the fact they've been telling us for weeks that they were prepared for this?
[01:12:56.443 --> 01:12:57.123]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:12:57.543 --> 01:13:06.326]  And when you look at the fact that Obama, on September 16th, long before we learned about this, even before the guy landed in the United States,
[01:13:07.286 --> 01:13:14.695]  They're saying that there's not any concern, but he's meeting with people at CDC, and then we have this article up on InfoWars today.
[01:13:15.015 --> 01:13:20.021]  Disaster teams were notified months ago that they would be activated in October.
[01:13:20.682 --> 01:13:21.543]  I find that interesting.
[01:13:22.984 --> 01:13:31.289]  Combine that with this report from the CDC that's estimating the future number of cases in the Ebola epidemic in Liberia and Sierra Leone.
[01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:41.435]  Now what they are predicting is that those cases are going, if you look at this chart, if you're watching the broadcast, essentially you've got a hockey stick.
[01:13:41.475 --> 01:13:44.716]  Now everybody has seen the hockey stick, the exponential growth graph.
[01:13:45.757 --> 01:13:48.758]  When Al Gore is trying to scare everybody about global warming.
[01:13:48.838 --> 01:13:54.481]  Here we have something that many people are being criticized, saying we're fear-mongering, we're creating hysteria.
[01:13:55.141 --> 01:14:00.284]  And yet, part of the hysteria is being created because they're not being upfront with people.
[01:14:00.304 --> 01:14:03.345]  They're not advising people what the real risks and what they're seeing.
[01:14:03.645 --> 01:14:06.547]  They do the reports, but they're pretty much hidden.
[01:14:06.587 --> 01:14:07.887]  It's not being widely reported.
[01:14:08.328 --> 01:14:10.789]  This is a report that came out actually before
[01:14:11.670 --> 01:14:14.133]  Uh, they released the information about this individual.
[01:14:14.173 --> 01:14:17.638]  This is September the 26th, so this is something that had been in the works for a while.
[01:14:17.658 --> 01:14:26.510]  And they point out that within just six months, this was first identified in West Africa, in Guinea, on March 22nd of this year.
[01:14:26.530 --> 01:14:27.812]  So it's only been about six months.
[01:14:28.433 --> 01:14:34.778]  They say, still, the number of cases in Liberia are doubling every 15 to 20 days.
[01:14:34.798 --> 01:14:36.840]  That's one of the reasons why we're seeing survival rates of 50%.
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:47.048]  It's not that 50% of the people are getting better, it's just that the number of cases is expanding so rapidly that it makes it look like the number of people that are dying there is actually lower.
[01:14:47.088 --> 01:14:51.892]  The actual casualty figure and prognosis for people is about a 70% death rate.
[01:14:52.292 --> 01:14:53.814]  And Sierra Leone is not far behind.
[01:14:53.854 --> 01:14:55.255]  Now, to put this in perspective,
[01:14:55.795 --> 01:14:58.677]  Liberia only has a little over 4 million people.
[01:14:58.697 --> 01:15:01.158]  It's got a population about the size of North Carolina.
[01:15:01.518 --> 01:15:07.521]  Imagine if there were 3,000 cases of Ebola in North Carolina and you'd already had 2,000 deaths.
[01:15:08.142 --> 01:15:08.902]  That's what we're looking at.
[01:15:08.942 --> 01:15:22.429]  If you want to normalize that back to the United States, we're looking at a situation that went from just starting six months ago to a situation if you normalize those numbers up to the population of the United States, about 300,000 people coming down with Ebola and about 200,000 dying.
[01:15:23.770 --> 01:15:25.391]  Now, that's what this doctor just said.
[01:15:25.891 --> 01:15:33.774]  That although we have a wonderful medical system here, they don't have the resources to handle that kind of massive pandemic.
[01:15:33.854 --> 01:15:34.774]  And that's the issue.
[01:15:34.834 --> 01:15:41.296]  We could easily be overwhelmed with that just as people in West Africa have been overwhelmed with that.
[01:15:41.336 --> 01:15:43.637]  Their infrastructure, everything in that country.
[01:15:44.157 --> 01:15:47.519]  The doctor at Emory University talked to
[01:15:48.519 --> 01:15:58.632]  Scientific American, and he told them they had 21 nurses, 5 doctors, and hundreds of staff persons working with those 2 people that they brought back, the first 2, Kent Brantley, Dr. Kent Brantley and the assistant.
[01:15:59.613 --> 01:16:00.994]  Now how many times can they do that?
[01:16:01.055 --> 01:16:05.300]  They did that and they were able, they had that many people because they had to sterilize everything.
[01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:10.623]  They got in industrial autoclaves to burn and sterilize everything they came in contact with.
[01:16:10.863 --> 01:16:13.824]  So they had a massive amount of staff for just those two people.
[01:16:14.224 --> 01:16:19.127]  What happens to our medical capacity when that number expands exponentially?
[01:16:19.207 --> 01:16:23.149]  Already today, we saw just yesterday they were saying they're isolating 12 to 18 people.
[01:16:23.709 --> 01:16:25.370]  Then we see this morning it was 80.
[01:16:25.770 --> 01:16:28.492]  Now Reuters is reporting 100 people have come in contact.
[01:16:28.532 --> 01:16:31.133]  Now they're not isolating these people yet.
[01:16:31.173 --> 01:16:32.694]  They've only isolated four people.
[01:16:33.419 --> 01:16:37.382]  So they're still allowing these other people, I don't know how, what they're doing to monitor them.
[01:16:37.482 --> 01:16:44.547]  I mean, considering the press conference yesterday, I think that did a lot to scare a lot of people.
[01:16:44.667 --> 01:16:51.172]  The fact that they would make that kind of mistake and the fact that they would not even address it up front is what I find absolutely amazing.
[01:16:51.472 --> 01:16:52.833]  Right, they were trying to cover their tracks.
[01:16:54.437 --> 01:16:57.198]  A hundred people exposed, those are the people they know about.
[01:16:57.278 --> 01:16:59.099]  I mean this, how long was it?
[01:16:59.199 --> 01:17:01.020]  Four days he was walking around Dallas.
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:05.761]  There could be hundreds more that were exposed that they don't know about and there's no way to track them down.
[01:17:05.921 --> 01:17:07.502]  Paul, they're only concerned about two things.
[01:17:07.622 --> 01:17:10.723]  Continuity of government and continuity of their career.
[01:17:11.063 --> 01:17:13.664]  Okay, so they're not going to admit that anything is wrong.
[01:17:14.025 --> 01:17:17.326]  When I started in engineering, I was working with quality control.
[01:17:17.346 --> 01:17:22.068]  If we had something went wrong, the first thing we had to do to a customer was to explain to them
[01:17:22.828 --> 01:17:26.649]  What the procedures were that we screwed up and how those were going to be changed.
[01:17:26.789 --> 01:17:27.870]  That wouldn't happen again.
[01:17:27.930 --> 01:17:30.291]  We didn't hear that from Rick Perry.
[01:17:30.331 --> 01:17:32.931]  We didn't hear that from the Texas officials or the CDC.
[01:17:33.332 --> 01:17:35.292]  We just heard, don't worry, we're experts.
[01:17:35.332 --> 01:17:36.953]  We've been working on this for years.
[01:17:37.013 --> 01:17:39.794]  We know what we're doing and we've got a great system here in America.
[01:17:41.018 --> 01:17:46.044]  I mean, I watched that yesterday and it didn't seem very convincing.
[01:17:46.224 --> 01:17:50.490]  They seemed to be in quite of a fluster trying to answer those questions that were being thrown at them.
[01:17:50.850 --> 01:18:00.321]  But another point is, you know, you mentioned when Bradley was brought in with the other doctors, the sophisticated procedures that were necessary to ensure his proper isolation.
[01:18:00.862 --> 01:18:03.123]  We don't know if that's the case in the Texas hospital.
[01:18:03.583 --> 01:18:04.424]  Also, planes.
[01:18:04.484 --> 01:18:06.545]  You cannot sterilize planes.
[01:18:06.625 --> 01:18:09.466]  You know, they're massive flying computers.
[01:18:10.607 --> 01:18:15.129]  There were experts on CNN today saying that it's just not possible to sterilize planes.
[01:18:15.169 --> 01:18:22.032]  So, Ebola victims could have been on planes, they could be reused for subsequent journeys, and other people could become infected.
[01:18:22.092 --> 01:18:24.173]  So, all kinds of possibilities here.
[01:18:24.193 --> 01:18:25.914]  Then we have a seeming cover-up.
[01:18:26.494 --> 01:18:32.643]  To some extent, or just trying to dampen hysteria on this potential for the airborne transmission of Ebola.
[01:18:32.703 --> 01:18:35.307]  Again, a story out of Infowars.com yesterday.
[01:18:35.748 --> 01:18:40.434]  Canadian health agency deletes info on airborne spread of Ebola.
[01:18:40.975 --> 01:18:42.357]  And they had it in their original...
[01:18:43.018 --> 01:18:52.946]  Mode of transmission directives on their official website, the Public Health Agency of Canada, quote, airborne spread of Ebola among humans is strongly suspected.
[01:18:53.446 --> 01:18:58.811]  Later that was amended to read airborne transmission has not been demonstrated between non-human primates.
[01:18:59.531 --> 01:19:11.216]  Again, the UN chief, the head of the Ebola team for the United Nations came out today and said that there's a nightmare prospect that the virus could mutate and become airborne if it's not quickly brought under control.
[01:19:11.277 --> 01:19:18.280]  So, of course, current understanding is that it's not airborne, but his point is, if we allow it to circulate, if we don't
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:26.142]  Nip it in the bud now, then it could mutate as it spreads amongst the population and that could cause it to go airborne.
[01:19:26.182 --> 01:19:33.365]  Again, that's not InfoWars saying that, it's not Alex Jones saying that, it's the head of the UN Ebola team saying that, David Knight.
[01:19:34.164 --> 01:19:35.185]  Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
[01:19:35.445 --> 01:19:51.935]  And I gotta say, when I read the account last night of the patient who came here and what he was doing before he came here, it was pretty clear that it's not being communicated to the people of Liberia what they need to do to protect themselves from the spread of the disease.
[01:19:51.975 --> 01:19:54.777]  And the problem is, it's not being communicated to people of America either.
[01:19:55.828 --> 01:19:59.695]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show with David Knight taking some of your calls.
[01:20:00.115 --> 01:20:00.897]  Stay tuned.

[01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:16.876]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:22:17.136 --> 01:22:24.965]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:25.245 --> 01:22:29.547]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:22:29.747 --> 01:22:33.588]  By Patriots Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:22:33.728 --> 01:22:39.450]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:22:39.690 --> 01:22:42.411]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.

[01:23:12.148 --> 01:23:14.768]  Congress is now trying to outlaw civilian body armor.
[01:23:14.848 --> 01:23:17.169]  And if House Bill H.R.
[01:23:17.449 --> 01:23:21.810]  5344 becomes law, you can kiss your right to protect yourself against rifle bullets goodbye.

[01:24:33.627 --> 01:24:38.990]  It's the Alex Jones Show live with me, Paul Joseph Watson, and David Knight in studio.
[01:24:39.090 --> 01:24:46.354]  Coming up in the next hour, we're going to talk to Lionel, who has been a regular guest and contributor to Infowars.com.
[01:24:46.394 --> 01:24:51.257]  He's going to talk about some of the cultural issues that surround these subjects, going to talk about ISIS.
[01:24:51.977 --> 01:24:55.841]  Syria and a number of different other topics.
[01:24:55.921 --> 01:25:02.287]  Now we're talking about Hong Kong, because of course we had these huge protests erupt over the past few days.
[01:25:02.407 --> 01:25:09.073]  I put out an article on Infowars.com, Hong Kong politician fears mini Tiananmen in response to unrest.
[01:25:09.133 --> 01:25:16.921]  And this was a politician who was actually against the protest as she blamed the political party that she was in opposition to
[01:25:17.621 --> 01:25:19.203]  for stirring up these protesters.
[01:25:19.263 --> 01:25:29.631]  So this invocation of a potential new Tiananmen Square in terms of a Beijing military crackdown on these demonstrators could be seen as more of a threat than anything.
[01:25:30.351 --> 01:25:44.423]  But Xi basically said that they should respect authority, they shouldn't be carrying out these protests against the Chinese government because this started back in August, I believe it was, where China put out this advisory where they said that
[01:25:44.983 --> 01:26:02.490]  They now see Hong Kong as basically their own fiefdom, after the Special Administrative Region was handed to them by the British back in 1997, under the understanding that Hong Kong would retain its political freedoms, its electoral freedoms, until at least 2047.
[01:26:04.691 --> 01:26:11.696]  So, now China comes in and says, we have the right to choose your political candidates before you can vote on them.
[01:26:12.176 --> 01:26:16.078]  Understandably, that has caused a massive revolt in Hong Kong.
[01:26:16.098 --> 01:26:22.402]  Now we've got huge protests, tear gas, some police brutality attempting to disperse those demonstrators.
[01:26:22.883 --> 01:26:27.646]  And David Knight, more on this in terms of the identity of the protest movement involved in this.
[01:26:28.306 --> 01:26:31.428]  Yeah, Paul, so much for the promises of communists, okay?
[01:26:31.608 --> 01:26:34.510]  They said they were going to give them 50 years and already they're cracking down here.
[01:26:35.210 --> 01:26:37.572]  But it's starting to reach ahead again.
[01:26:37.592 --> 01:26:39.573]  They have Hong Kong protesters.
[01:26:39.853 --> 01:26:41.674]  They tried to get them to stand down.
[01:26:41.915 --> 01:26:45.797]  Even some of the leaders were telling them to stand down and yet the people stepped up their demonstrations.
[01:26:46.357 --> 01:26:47.818]  They occupied offices.
[01:26:47.878 --> 01:26:52.001]  Now we have reports out of The Guardian today that police have been seen carrying rubber bullets and other kit.
[01:26:52.521 --> 01:26:56.825]  And to compound housing offices of the chief executive that they are occupying.
[01:26:57.185 --> 01:27:10.397]  They said pictures that are widely shared on social media are showing police carrying long boxes, a barrel that is labeled round 38 millimeter rubber baton, multi another with a one and a half inch CS on it, possibly a reference to CS gas.
[01:27:10.437 --> 01:27:12.059]  So it looks like they're going to start getting rough.
[01:27:12.619 --> 01:27:18.244]  You know, you carried that article on Monday about the official talking about they didn't want to see Tiananmen Square coming.
[01:27:19.125 --> 01:27:35.638]  And I had just seen a picture before I saw your article of a small woman, very small woman, in a red dress, barefoot, right in the face of half a dozen guys just armed to the teeth and in full riot gear that were towering over her, about a foot taller than she was.
[01:27:36.199 --> 01:27:40.602]  I looked at that and I said, that is the Hong Kong version of Tiananmen Square.
[01:27:40.662 --> 01:27:42.344]  That is the resolution of these people.
[01:27:43.124 --> 01:27:44.905]  But there's something else behind this.
[01:27:44.965 --> 01:27:50.786]  There's the Wall Street Journal article that came out today that essentially looked at the Christian influence of this.
[01:27:50.866 --> 01:27:55.327]  It said the Hong Kong democracy protests carry a Christian mission for some.
[01:27:55.887 --> 01:27:58.968]  Now, Christians understand where this is going.
[01:27:59.068 --> 01:28:01.769]  This is not simply a political issue.
[01:28:02.429 --> 01:28:03.770]  It impinges on every freedom.
[01:28:04.190 --> 01:28:10.153]  And of course, we all know how severely the Chinese government has persecuted Christians.
[01:28:10.513 --> 01:28:19.978]  When I was in mainland China, and we took a train from mainland China to Hong Kong, we could tell that we were out of mainland China and approaching Hong Kong because we started seeing crosses.
[01:28:20.418 --> 01:28:22.480]  You don't see that in mainland China.
[01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:30.604]  So, they know where this is headed, and just like the black regiment that was part of the American Revolution here, and that was the clergy who got up in front of
[01:28:31.164 --> 01:28:31.965]  We're good to go.
[01:28:48.078 --> 01:28:55.362]  Unfortunately, here in America, most of the people in the churches will take the position of that lady saying, obey your government.
[01:28:55.702 --> 01:28:57.523]  Just sit down and shut up, obey your government.
[01:28:57.563 --> 01:29:00.665]  They don't see where this is headed, even into Christian persecution.
[01:29:01.125 --> 01:29:13.812]  And so what they're saying is that Hong Kong churches are playing a very quiet but important role in the city's protests, offering food and shelter to demonstrators, with some organizers and supporters citing Christian values as the inspiration for their fight.
[01:29:14.272 --> 01:29:19.938]  And they have a political scientist here saying that Christians and the Chinese government, the difference is unbridgeable.
[01:29:19.998 --> 01:29:22.461]  They say Christians, by definition, don't trust the communists.
[01:29:22.521 --> 01:29:25.485]  The communists have suppressed Christians wherever they are.
[01:29:25.505 --> 01:29:27.106]  And of course, we know that is true.
[01:29:27.467 --> 01:29:29.769]  They even talked to a couple of the occupied leaders.
[01:29:29.889 --> 01:29:31.011]  One is a Baptist minister.
[01:29:31.451 --> 01:29:34.513]  Another one said he's a Christian, but he wouldn't talk about his faith in detail.
[01:29:34.953 --> 01:29:37.175]  He said his faith was in the streets.
[01:29:37.275 --> 01:29:39.556]  He knew that they were going to stand up to this.
[01:29:39.596 --> 01:29:47.641]  So, there's one other data point that we see, just like that app that that guy was talking about, how they could communicate with each other over short distances without Wi-Fi, without cell phone.
[01:29:48.422 --> 01:29:52.184]  We'll be back with more on the situation in Hong Kong and your calls coming up.
[01:29:52.244 --> 01:29:55.766]  This is the Alex Jones Show live, InfoWars.com.
[01:29:55.806 --> 01:29:56.407]  Don't go away.
[01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:02.547]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.469 --> 01:30:06.155]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.954 --> 01:30:12.035]  Open your eyes.
[01:30:12.475 --> 01:30:15.417]  It's time to give your eyes a powerful nutritional boost.
[01:30:15.897 --> 01:30:22.021]  Sight is the primary input to the brain, arguably making eyesight the most important sense we have.
[01:30:22.361 --> 01:30:30.326]  And just like the other important organs in our bodies, our eyes function at peak levels when they are fed the proper amounts of essential nutrition.
[01:30:30.726 --> 01:30:31.807]  Open your eyes!
[01:30:32.108 --> 01:30:47.083]  Combining key ingredients like vitamin A, zinc, lutein, proprietary saffron bulb extracts and more, Occupower by InfoWars Life is a new formulation specifically designed to nutritionally assist the natural function of healthy eyes.
[01:30:47.703 --> 01:30:55.167]  Optimize the natural power of your eyes with the latest addition to the super high quality InfoWars Live formulations, Occupower.
[01:30:55.447 --> 01:31:00.630]  Go to InfoWarsLive.com or InfoWarsStore.com to order Occupower.
[01:31:00.970 --> 01:31:01.430]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:31:01.470 --> 01:31:01.990]  Occupower.
[01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:02.671]  Open your eyes.
[01:31:10.325 --> 01:31:19.849]  Using unparalleled research and the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super-oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:31:19.989 --> 01:31:29.754]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:31:29.914 --> 01:31:32.835]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[01:31:33.035 --> 01:31:40.161]  And contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[01:31:40.282 --> 01:31:44.685]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[01:31:44.946 --> 01:31:49.630]  Oxy powder does not require time off work and there's no need for bad tasting concoctions.
[01:31:49.930 --> 01:31:55.392]  Instead, Oxy-Powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[01:31:55.612 --> 01:32:00.833]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.
[01:32:00.953 --> 01:32:06.915]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com to get started with Oxy-Powder or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:32:10.356 --> 01:32:16.422]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[01:32:16.482 --> 01:32:19.805]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:32:19.825 --> 01:32:21.347]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[01:32:21.387 --> 01:32:27.853]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:32:27.953 --> 01:32:33.839]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[01:32:33.979 --> 01:32:37.743]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:32:37.923 --> 01:32:40.846]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:32:41.006 --> 01:32:49.034]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:32:49.294 --> 01:32:51.336]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:32:51.396 --> 01:32:52.437]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:32:52.797 --> 01:33:01.549]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.TV and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[01:33:01.749 --> 01:33:04.193]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.
[01:33:04.413 --> 01:33:08.719]  Become a member, share your membership, and help take the info war to the next level.
[01:33:24.372 --> 01:33:25.834]  We are on the march.
[01:33:26.254 --> 01:33:28.637]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:33:29.418 --> 01:33:32.241]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:40.626 --> 01:33:42.487]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:42.527 --> 01:33:47.430]  It's Paul Joseph Watson in studio with David Knight.
[01:33:47.490 --> 01:33:50.692]  Quick breaking news on the individual who came into Dallas with Ebola.
[01:33:51.133 --> 01:33:55.635]  Liberia to prosecute man who brought Ebola to US, reports the Associated Press.
[01:33:56.756 --> 01:34:04.664]  Liberian authorities say they plan to prosecute the man infected with Ebola who brought the disease to the United States saying he'd lied on his airport health questionnaire.
[01:34:04.924 --> 01:34:11.250]  So more questions about whether he travelled to the US simply to get better treatment than he might expect to get.
[01:34:11.830 --> 01:34:12.430]  In Africa.
[01:34:12.831 --> 01:34:15.892]  Before the break we were touching upon the Hong Kong protests.
[01:34:15.912 --> 01:34:19.714]  The US now admits it's funding Occupy Central reports.
[01:34:20.194 --> 01:34:38.764]  Antony Cartolucci, our land destroyer, basically he refers to a Washington Post article which states, quote, Chinese leaders unnerved by protests elsewhere this year have been steadily tightening controls over civic organizations on the mainland suspected of carrying out the work of foreign powers.
[01:34:39.284 --> 01:34:51.718]  Later in the article they go on to explain how the Chinese President and Vladimir Putin are talking about this Hong Kong situation as if it could be a staged, or at least hijacked, cover-colour revolution.
[01:34:51.758 --> 01:34:59.006]  So now they're saying that these Hong Kong protests could have been funded by the likes of the National Endowment for Democracy.
[01:34:59.566 --> 01:35:11.752]  Which we've seen before with the Arab Spring and of course in Kiev, with the overthrow of the democratically elected government there, were very much evident in hijacking and steering the protests.
[01:35:11.832 --> 01:35:16.954]  Again, not to say that this Hong Kong situation isn't founded on genuine grievances.
[01:35:17.014 --> 01:35:25.779]  It obviously is, given that Beijing has basically announced that now it's going to hand-select political candidates in Hong Kong before people can vote on them.
[01:35:25.839 --> 01:35:28.260]  Again, eviscerating their freedoms that they've cherished
[01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:34.163]  For a long time, defended staunchly against potential Chinese imposition.
[01:35:34.223 --> 01:35:44.567]  David Knight, your take on these claims that the US, the CIA, the NDE could be hijacking the Hong Kong protests as a form of destabilization aimed at China?
[01:35:45.308 --> 01:35:46.088]  Well, no doubt they are.
[01:35:46.108 --> 01:35:54.172]  They always use these Machiavellian calculations and they will always fund the enemy of their enemy, whether they want to do it, and they will always try
[01:35:56.254 --> 01:35:57.655]  There's always an issue anywhere.
[01:35:58.315 --> 01:36:05.500]  But just because they give money to them as they've given to other people, that doesn't delegitimize the movement.
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:07.141]  I believe there's a lot more to this.
[01:36:07.201 --> 01:36:09.942]  I believe there's a lot more to some of these other movements that have been funded.
[01:36:10.403 --> 01:36:19.448]  So just as we see that there are people in Islamic countries that are angry and furious
[01:36:21.776 --> 01:36:24.318]  Activated because of the American presence there.
[01:36:24.598 --> 01:36:28.561]  They use those people, they manipulate that, they build it up to create another threat.
[01:36:29.101 --> 01:36:39.728]  We understand that there is a large part of the American government that is in the military-industrial complex that is always fomenting unrest, always fomenting war, because that is in their interest.
[01:36:39.768 --> 01:36:41.349]  And we understand there's competing blocs.
[01:36:41.789 --> 01:36:45.492]  But there are still very legitimate things that are going on here in Hong Kong.
[01:36:45.532 --> 01:36:50.916]  And I think the people there, as I mentioned before, they truly understand the issue of freedom.
[01:36:51.956 --> 01:37:01.245]  Chinese government steps in and says, we are not going to allow you to have any candidate stand for election unless they have pledged their loyalty and love for mainland Chinese communists.
[01:37:01.765 --> 01:37:03.807]  That was the impetus of this.
[01:37:03.847 --> 01:37:04.688]  That's where it began.
[01:37:05.268 --> 01:37:09.993]  And it's up to those people in Hong Kong, just as it is to anyone everywhere.
[01:37:10.593 --> 01:37:22.197]  To make sure that their freedom movements don't get co-opted by other people, just as we've seen that happening here with the Tea Party, with Occupy Wall Street.
[01:37:22.557 --> 01:37:38.343]  We don't delegitimize the grievances of those people, but they have to be aware that their movements and their grievances aren't taken over by people who are just going to co-opt that and shove it aside and push that down and not address what they want to have happen.
[01:37:39.278 --> 01:37:46.581]  I mean, the situation in China, they have alternate political parties in China, but it's in name only.
[01:37:46.621 --> 01:37:55.385]  I mean, the alternate political party leaders have to go to, again, pledge their love for the Communist Party of China on basically a monthly basis.
[01:37:55.425 --> 01:38:02.729]  They have to go to a kind of brainwashing session where they get the talking points from the Communist Party, even though they're supposedly representing
[01:38:03.289 --> 01:38:07.391]  An alternative, and they have to profess their allegiance to the Communist Party.
[01:38:07.431 --> 01:38:18.735]  So this is what Beijing is trying to impose on Hong Kong, which up until now has been its own autonomous state, of course, since being handed back to China by the British in 1997.
[01:38:19.155 --> 01:38:26.458]  But those freedoms, those protections, were supposed to be legally bound, protected, against Communist incursion.
[01:38:26.518 --> 01:38:30.960]  Now Beijing is trying to roll that back, which is why you see a lot of the protests.
[01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:34.121]  Moving on, though, there's a story out of California, David.
[01:38:34.301 --> 01:38:35.802]  I mean, we've talked about this before.
[01:38:35.822 --> 01:38:43.746]  In fact, there was a case, I remember, a couple of years ago, one of the stars of the National Geographic Doomsday Preppers show.
[01:38:44.146 --> 01:38:47.788]  He basically went in to get treated for back pain at his local doctor's.
[01:38:48.308 --> 01:38:50.469]  They took him to be suicidal.
[01:38:50.769 --> 01:38:57.112]  He later ended up having his guns seized because he may have, you know, he may have self-harmed or whatever the excuse was.
[01:38:57.172 --> 01:38:57.853]  Now we're seeing that
[01:38:58.513 --> 01:39:07.901]  A similar case in California, David, where they're talking about family members of gun owners ratting them out and potentially leading to gun confiscation.
[01:39:07.941 --> 01:39:08.582]  Tell us about that.
[01:39:09.110 --> 01:39:12.151]  Well yeah, that's the bill that was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown.
[01:39:12.211 --> 01:39:23.116]  It's the first law in the United States that's going to give families who think that a close relative might commit gun violence, it gives the family the ability to petition for a restraining order, essentially have that person's firearms taken away.
[01:39:23.816 --> 01:39:29.798]  Now of course we don't want to see mentally ill people with firearms, but it all boils down to what is the process here?
[01:39:30.299 --> 01:39:32.099]  Is this due process going on?
[01:39:32.179 --> 01:39:33.060]  Is there another agenda?
[01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:45.338]  And I would say, Paul, that since virtually all these cases are predicated not by gun ownership, but by the use of SSRIs, why can't the family petition that they get their SSRIs taken away?
[01:39:45.378 --> 01:39:48.924]  I mean, they're not going to do anything to address what we all believe.
[01:39:49.524 --> 01:39:55.947]  Here at InfoWars is the root cause of this, and that is the increased conditions.
[01:39:55.967 --> 01:40:06.071]  When you take these SSRIs for psychological conditions, in many cases it exacerbates those conditions, especially if someone comes off of the SSRI.
[01:40:06.111 --> 01:40:11.193]  So that's really what they need to address, and the fact that they are not looking at
[01:40:12.313 --> 01:40:16.495]  That makes you understand that there's a different agenda here.
[01:40:16.555 --> 01:40:20.836]  There's strictly another way to control firearms and to do it without due process.
[01:40:21.717 --> 01:40:23.517]  Okay, we're going to go to some of your calls now.
[01:40:23.817 --> 01:40:25.478]  John in Michigan has been holding a while.
[01:40:25.518 --> 01:40:26.178]  We'll go to John.
[01:40:26.198 --> 01:40:26.719]  You're on the air.
[01:40:27.759 --> 01:40:30.260]  I want to talk about this lady from Gainesville, Georgia.
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:31.821]  Her name is Ashley Huff.
[01:40:31.881 --> 01:40:32.461]  She was only 23.
[01:40:32.501 --> 01:40:37.943]  She was arrested for possessing a spoon covered in Spaghetti-O residue.
[01:40:39.016 --> 01:40:39.456]  We're good.
[01:40:57.103 --> 01:41:09.200]  It's a giant mistake, you know, and it ruined her life, and it's sad because they tried to get her to take the plea bargain the whole time, just plead guilty, you know, and we'll let you out, you know?
[01:41:10.379 --> 01:41:27.131]  And it's pretty sad, but also I was looking at, there's been like a formerly classified documents that have been obtained from the Department of Defense that reveal that like colloidal silver has an effect against fighting Ebola, you know, with your immune system.
[01:41:27.191 --> 01:41:29.192]  It helps fight the hemorrhagic fever.
[01:41:29.212 --> 01:41:37.178]  And apparently they've been trying to block shipments going to Africa, the World Health Organization.
[01:41:40.376 --> 01:41:42.257]  Yeah, I've read about that story.
[01:41:42.477 --> 01:41:45.819]  I don't know if it's confirmed or not, but it definitely seems to be one that keeps cropping up.
[01:41:46.139 --> 01:41:58.906]  Referring to the previous story, I mean, David, isn't this emblematic of a banana republic, where you commit some petty crime that's mistaken, you get trapped in the penal system, and you can't get out?
[01:41:58.986 --> 01:42:01.327]  I mean, that really gets to the heart of it, doesn't it?
[01:42:01.827 --> 01:42:02.507]  It really does.
[01:42:02.868 --> 01:42:07.590]  And, you know, SpaghettiOs is an extreme case of that.
[01:42:08.150 --> 01:42:15.554]  But look at the reality that 80% of the people in prison for drug offenses are there for possession of marijuana.
[01:42:16.584 --> 01:42:20.445]  We have more people in prison than any other country per population.
[01:42:20.545 --> 01:42:23.546]  Way more than Communist China that we were just talking about.
[01:42:24.106 --> 01:42:26.627]  And most of them are there because of marijuana.
[01:42:26.647 --> 01:42:37.511]  So, you know, when we look at this prison system, there's a lot of profit that is there for the private prison companies in a lot of different areas, but it's a way for the government to exercise control.
[01:42:38.191 --> 01:42:46.320]  There's a lot of ballot initiatives coming up where people would have, in Alaska and other places, there's marijuana that is on the ballot.
[01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:48.623]  Are they going to allow medical marijuana?
[01:42:48.643 --> 01:42:50.144]  Are they going to decriminalize it?
[01:42:50.425 --> 01:42:55.150]  I think it's something that people need to take a very close look at and we need to question whether or not
[01:42:55.891 --> 01:43:00.154]  We want to continue this drug war that's gone on now for 40, 50 years.
[01:43:00.194 --> 01:43:12.081]  It started back in the 70s when Richard Nixon declared a war on drugs and then it went into steroids with Ronald Reagan where they had mandatory minimums and all other kinds of things that filled up the prisons.
[01:43:12.761 --> 01:43:13.462]  It hasn't worked.
[01:43:14.181 --> 01:43:14.741]  It hasn't worked.
[01:43:14.781 --> 01:43:17.063]  Our experiment with alcohol prohibition didn't work.
[01:43:17.083 --> 01:43:20.025]  The only difference is that with alcohol prohibition, they did it legally.
[01:43:20.065 --> 01:43:21.325]  They passed a constitutional amendment.
[01:43:21.586 --> 01:43:29.230]  They don't even have the constitutionally legal authority to prohibit marijuana or any of these other drugs that they're now enforcing as part of the war on drugs.
[01:43:29.631 --> 01:43:31.452]  That's something people need to take a look at.
[01:43:33.606 --> 01:43:40.109]  5% of the world's population in the United States, yet it has 25% of the world's prison population.
[01:43:40.130 --> 01:43:42.391]  That makes the United States the world's largest jailer.
[01:43:42.411 --> 01:43:44.712]  I mean, these stats are ridiculous.
[01:43:44.752 --> 01:43:49.375]  Since 1970, the prison population in the United States has increased 700%.
[01:43:50.336 --> 01:43:53.257]  And most of that is the war on drugs.
[01:43:53.297 --> 01:43:57.040]  And I've had Law Enforcement Against Prohibition on many times.
[01:43:57.060 --> 01:43:58.781]  I've interviewed them on the nightly news.
[01:43:58.821 --> 01:44:00.362]  Jim Gearock, a former prosecutor,
[01:44:01.102 --> 01:44:01.583]  We're good to go.
[01:44:20.985 --> 01:44:22.485]  And so they need to address it that way.
[01:44:22.525 --> 01:44:23.986]  That's what's filling up our prisons.
[01:44:24.346 --> 01:44:28.707]  And there's a lot of very sinister undercurrents to that with the private prisons and other things like that.
[01:44:28.947 --> 01:44:30.087]  But it's that legal system.
[01:44:30.367 --> 01:44:37.429]  That's where we first began losing our rights to due process, where they could essentially charge inanimate objects with crimes and just confiscate them.
[01:44:37.469 --> 01:44:43.451]  So even before the war on terror, we had the war on drugs that's essentially attacking the fundamental
[01:44:44.131 --> 01:44:48.773]  basis of our liberty and our right to the presumption of innocence until proven guilty.
[01:44:48.793 --> 01:44:54.796]  I mean, talking about due process with these guns, I mean, we have lost due process so many decades ago with the war on drugs.
[01:44:55.816 --> 01:44:57.817]  Pamela, in California, you're on the air.
[01:44:57.837 --> 01:44:58.458]  Go ahead, Pamela.
[01:44:59.378 --> 01:45:10.463]  Hi, I'm calling because I wanted to let everyone know about, there's a Texas federal lawsuit to force Obama and DHS to stop illegal aliens, dump of illegal aliens
[01:45:11.021 --> 01:45:22.786]  They're not pre-screened for illnesses, criminal background, and identity, and quarantining these people, as well as people coming, traveling legally from Ebola-stricken areas.
[01:45:23.907 --> 01:45:32.271]  And there's actually a hearing on this lawsuit October 29th in Brownsville, Texas, at the federal courthouse at 10 in the morning.
[01:45:33.451 --> 01:45:36.572]  And Orly Tates is a private citizen.
[01:45:36.592 --> 01:45:39.734]  She's a doctor of dentistry in California.
[01:45:40.499 --> 01:45:42.540]  And she's a private citizen.
[01:45:42.580 --> 01:46:08.048]  She brought this lawsuit, and she's doing the work that all the state's attorney generals and all the state governors should be doing in trying to defend herself and defend other citizens of this country from the federal government's lack of protecting us by sealing the borders, by ensuring people coming over the border aren't carrying seriously contagious, deadly illnesses like Ebola.
[01:46:09.306 --> 01:46:27.159]  So I was calling about that and it just really demonstrates that actually Governor Perry was alerted of this lawsuit, hasn't done anything to become an intervener or to join the lawsuit, and then also the State Attorney General of Texas was alerted by myself.
[01:46:27.259 --> 01:46:28.439]  I called both offices.
[01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:35.885]  So we're in a sorry state of affairs where even our states are not protecting us from the federal government.
[01:46:36.803 --> 01:46:46.707]  Yeah, I mean, we've got an article on Infowars.com which kind of ties into that, which is Rand Paul blaming political correctness for hindering scientific decisions on Ebola outbreak.
[01:46:47.108 --> 01:47:03.915]  And we've seen this at the border, haven't we David, where even the ISIS threat now is being ignored, even though we had the leaks from within law enforcement sources that ISIS was active in Mexico, just across the border, being ignored by the Obama administration because it's border agenda.
[01:47:04.375 --> 01:47:08.077]  is diametrically opposite to having anything safe and secure.
[01:47:08.137 --> 01:47:09.157]  What's your take on that, David?
[01:47:09.698 --> 01:47:12.779]  Well yeah, you mentioned Rand Paul's interview saying that it was political correctness.
[01:47:12.799 --> 01:47:16.181]  There was an article up at DrudgeLink 2 on Breitbart.
[01:47:16.421 --> 01:47:19.902]  Nancy Pelosi chides a reporter for using the term illegal alien.
[01:47:19.922 --> 01:47:27.246]  You know, when they asked her a question about illegal aliens, she said, are you referring to undocumented people who are in the United States?
[01:47:27.266 --> 01:47:29.727]  And he says, illegal alien, yes ma'am.
[01:47:29.847 --> 01:47:31.748]  She said, undocumented people, okay.
[01:47:32.308 --> 01:47:42.057]  So, we've got 13,500 people, The Daily Caller says, in these two countries that are under an Ebola pandemic that have visas to enter the United States.
[01:47:42.117 --> 01:47:46.621]  Now, if you've got a visa permission, there are certain conditions in that visa.
[01:47:46.861 --> 01:47:49.403]  They are granting you permission to enter.
[01:47:50.144 --> 01:47:54.067]  Why can't we at least have the conditions that people are going to be quarantined?
[01:47:54.608 --> 01:47:54.908]  We've got
[01:47:55.368 --> 01:47:57.249]  Dogs coming into the UK, as we mentioned yesterday.
[01:47:57.269 --> 01:47:59.911]  21 days if they're coming in from the EU or the United States.
[01:47:59.971 --> 01:48:01.852]  If they're coming in from other countries, three months.
[01:48:01.932 --> 01:48:09.036]  Why can't we at least protect our human population as much as other countries are concerned about protecting their dogs?
[01:48:09.236 --> 01:48:11.017]  It's just political correctness.
[01:48:11.858 --> 01:48:13.199]  Josh in Kansas, you're on the air.
[01:48:13.219 --> 01:48:13.739]  Go ahead, Josh.
[01:48:15.603 --> 01:48:17.164]  Hey guys, great listening to you.
[01:48:17.184 --> 01:48:19.445]  I wanted to talk to you a couple things real quick.
[01:48:19.705 --> 01:48:20.765]  One, about the Ebola.
[01:48:21.666 --> 01:48:26.808]  I know you're not NDs or anything, but, you know, kind of what's the best thing to protect ourselves against?
[01:48:26.988 --> 01:48:30.870]  I got a seven-year-old daughter that, you know, concerns me.
[01:48:31.750 --> 01:48:36.152]  The other thing, just what you guys brought up a minute ago with that other caller about the war on drugs.
[01:48:36.613 --> 01:48:37.433]  It's just a joke.
[01:48:37.873 --> 01:48:39.214]  It is absolutely a joke.
[01:48:39.234 --> 01:48:43.776]  You find me anywhere that Pothead is going to do
[01:48:44.987 --> 01:48:48.015]  Half the damage that somebody out drinking is going to do.
[01:48:48.316 --> 01:48:49.599]  It's just not going to happen.
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:53.047]  So, the war on drugs, that's absolutely just a joke.
[01:48:53.899 --> 01:48:57.281]  Well, I mean, with Ebola, there really is nothing you can do.
[01:48:57.301 --> 01:48:59.943]  I guess you could avoid large population areas.
[01:48:59.983 --> 01:49:02.164]  Obviously, you have to avoid West Africa.
[01:49:02.484 --> 01:49:05.026]  But apart from that, David, there's really not a lot.
[01:49:05.046 --> 01:49:08.087]  There's no known cure that's been actually established at the moment.
[01:49:08.127 --> 01:49:09.848]  They're working on vaccines, drugs.
[01:49:09.928 --> 01:49:11.509]  Some have been successful, some haven't.
[01:49:12.190 --> 01:49:14.991]  Apart from that, it's... And again, I meant the point... Go ahead.
[01:49:15.272 --> 01:49:17.753]  You know, you can take a look at what the CDC recommends.
[01:49:17.933 --> 01:49:19.194]  I might start
[01:49:19.634 --> 01:49:21.615]  With what they're recommending for airplanes.
[01:49:21.835 --> 01:49:25.417]  There's several publications where they're putting out their advice for that.
[01:49:26.378 --> 01:49:28.679]  But you know, there's certain risks that we just take every day.
[01:49:28.719 --> 01:49:30.620]  Every day we run down the road.
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:33.241]  We're pretty close to people that are passing us.
[01:49:33.581 --> 01:49:37.123]  Just a few feet away from somebody that's coming at me 60 miles an hour and I'm going 60 miles an hour.
[01:49:37.143 --> 01:49:41.025]  So there's an element of risk that we all accept in our everyday life.
[01:49:41.585 --> 01:49:47.589]  One of the things you can do is make sure that your immune system is in as good a shape as possible.
[01:49:47.970 --> 01:49:52.773]  I do believe that there's also something, that silver is very effective.
[01:49:53.113 --> 01:49:56.796]  You can, I take that on a regular basis, so does my family.
[01:49:56.956 --> 01:50:04.081]  I think that's very effective at not only controlling bacteria, but other studies have said that they thought that it was effective at controlling viruses.
[01:50:04.141 --> 01:50:06.022]  So you can do some research in that.
[01:50:06.063 --> 01:50:09.285]  I would just say, you know, make sure, as you should,
[01:50:10.060 --> 01:50:16.101]  Whether it's going to be from a pandemic or whether it's some kind of a power outage, you should prepare in advance a little bit.
[01:50:16.141 --> 01:50:22.363]  Have some extra food in case something does turn up in your community and they start quarantining and isolating things.
[01:50:22.403 --> 01:50:24.643]  It could be difficult for you to get access to food and water.
[01:50:24.943 --> 01:50:28.484]  So just make sure you have that there like you would if you were preparing for a storm.
[01:50:29.544 --> 01:50:35.565]  You need to always have a certain amount of preparation and then just try to prepare yourself to be as healthy as possible.
[01:50:35.585 --> 01:50:38.146]  You know, many of these people who are survivalists will say that
[01:50:39.026 --> 01:50:47.790]  People who have medical issues aren't going to make it past the first couple of days if there's some kind of a grid down scenario because they just aren't in physical shape.
[01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:51.492]  So try to get yourself and your family in as good a possible physical shape as you can.
[01:50:52.793 --> 01:50:55.194]  We're coming back on the Alex Jones Show live.
[01:50:55.214 --> 01:50:57.515]  We're going to talk to Lionel in the next segment.

[01:54:34.699 --> 01:54:43.062]  But back on the Alex Jones Show final segment of this second hour, we're still covering Ebola.
[01:54:43.782 --> 01:54:49.604]  David Knight's got some interesting info on the American doctor who came back into Atlanta to receive treatment.
[01:54:50.184 --> 01:54:56.626]  We've heard about the Z-map being pretty hit and miss, but David, some interesting info on how he was treated for Ebola.
[01:54:57.486 --> 01:55:02.629]  Yeah, when we first heard about it, we heard a lot about the fact that he recovered based on the ZMapp vaccine.
[01:55:02.670 --> 01:55:04.651]  Of course, that's a vaccine that's been developed by the U.S.
[01:55:04.711 --> 01:55:06.852]  military and tobacco companies.
[01:55:07.673 --> 01:55:10.935]  A very interesting genetically modified plant-a-body.
[01:55:10.995 --> 01:55:12.676]  It's not a traditional vaccine.
[01:55:13.397 --> 01:55:22.643]  But in a question interview with Scientific American, the medical director at Emory University, where Kent Brantley and the lady who was working with him were treated,
[01:55:23.423 --> 01:55:29.946]  They said it's been reported that Brantley received a blood transfusion from a recovered patient, and they asked him about that.
[01:55:29.966 --> 01:55:34.308]  Of course, the medical director said, I cannot comment on what I read on his chart.
[01:55:34.908 --> 01:55:44.973]  So, that brings into even more question the efficacy of ZMapp, because we've had two people who supposedly were treated with it and recovered, two people who were treated with it and died.
[01:55:45.373 --> 01:55:48.816]  Three people who were treated with it, and we still don't know the outcome of theirs.
[01:55:48.856 --> 01:55:53.839]  But that's not really anything that's any better than we've seen from the people who were not treated.
[01:55:54.920 --> 01:56:05.047]  So, further down in the interview, they ask him about the ethics of giving vaccines to patients that have not, where the vaccines have not been
[01:56:05.787 --> 01:56:06.087]  I don't
[01:56:22.614 --> 01:56:23.914]  But he makes an interesting comment.
[01:56:23.934 --> 01:56:30.837]  He says, well, I think it's ethical to study experimental biologicals and vaccines, but we have to be extremely cautious.
[01:56:31.337 --> 01:56:34.658]  It's not as though we have something we know works.
[01:56:34.898 --> 01:56:39.120]  So he apparently doesn't have any confidence in the ZMapp vaccine.
[01:56:39.764 --> 01:56:45.326]  And another thing you said was they told him he could be contagious for up to seven months.
[01:56:45.366 --> 01:56:46.226]  That was interesting.
[01:56:46.486 --> 01:56:52.668]  Yes, they said that they have noticed that people are shedding the Ebola virus, people who have recovered.
[01:56:52.688 --> 01:57:00.411]  They asked him about the immunity of the doctor and they said yes, he does have immunity now to that strain of Ebola, but there's five strains of Ebola.
[01:57:00.891 --> 01:57:09.340]  And they said that people continue to shed the virus in their sexual fluids, in their urine, for several months after, up to seven months afterwards.
[01:57:09.540 --> 01:57:22.474]  So, that is another vector of transmission that is possible, although they said that they had not, they see that being shed, but they have not verified that somebody has caught it by that method.
[01:57:23.206 --> 01:57:29.270]  In an article you mentioned earlier out of the Weekly Standard, White House screening procedures in place at our border.
[01:57:29.290 --> 01:57:39.878]  White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters today that after the Ebola case in Dallas, the Obama administration reminded border law enforcement agencies of the protocol to deal with people.
[01:57:40.158 --> 01:57:45.602]  So they're saying they reminded them as if these measures were already in place, but we know they weren't, David.
[01:57:46.483 --> 01:57:55.907]  Yeah, we see the same thing in this interview with the medical director at Emory University in the Scientific American interview that we heard from Perry and from the CDC yesterday.
[01:57:55.947 --> 01:58:03.931]  He says, as we've been saying all along, we feel the high fatality rates in developing parts of the world where this infection occurs are because of a lack of resources.
[01:58:04.631 --> 01:58:15.694]  Yet, when you look at how rapidly this has expanded, in a country where they only have 4 million people, in just 6 months they've had 3,000 cases, 2,000 of those people have died.
[01:58:16.075 --> 01:58:25.277]  And when you normalize that to the population of the United States, as we said before, you're looking at hundreds of thousands of people coming down with it, hundreds of thousands of people dying.
[01:58:25.398 --> 01:58:29.679]  Do we really have a medical system that can handle that kind of burden on it?
[01:58:30.179 --> 01:58:30.639]  I'd say no.
[01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:33.201]  So people need to be cautious about this.
[01:58:33.701 --> 01:58:38.605]  At this point, there's very little that we can do, but you need to try to educate yourself about how this is transmitted.
[01:58:39.685 --> 01:58:40.986]  David Knight, thanks for joining us.
[01:58:41.026 --> 01:58:46.410]  We'll be up with Lionel Media in studio next, talking to Lionel about a number of different topics.
[01:58:46.610 --> 01:58:48.271]  Alex Jones Show Live, stay tuned.
[01:58:52.814 --> 01:58:56.777]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:59:00.126 --> 01:59:08.614]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being, and you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[01:59:08.795 --> 01:59:15.021]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[01:59:15.401 --> 01:59:19.064]  Now, our extra strength new nascent iodine formula is here.
[01:59:19.304 --> 01:59:20.686]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:59:20.946 --> 01:59:24.989]  Leading the way into the next generation of super high quality nascent iodine.
[01:59:25.130 --> 01:59:30.534]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200 plus million year old salt solutions.
[01:59:30.734 --> 01:59:33.397]  Found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[01:59:33.797 --> 01:59:41.785]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients, and completely vegan.
[01:59:41.905 --> 01:59:45.369]  We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 Iodine for radiation.

[02:00:03.058 --> 02:00:04.983]  Waging War on Corruption.
[02:00:05.444 --> 02:00:08.211]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.178 --> 02:00:16.818]  Big Brother.
[02:00:17.478 --> 02:00:18.499]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:19.259 --> 02:00:20.339]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:21.019 --> 02:00:21.819]  You want answers?
[02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:23.480]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:24.140 --> 02:00:27.781]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:28.341 --> 02:00:32.382]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:40.330 --> 02:00:42.271]  Thursday, October 2nd, 2014.
[02:00:42.432 --> 02:00:46.234]  It's Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex Jones today.
[02:00:47.015 --> 02:00:54.880]  Coming up in the next segment, we're going to be joined by Lionel, who of course has been on the show before, to talk about a number of interesting topics.
[02:00:54.940 --> 02:01:00.144]  Also going to take your calls for Lionel later in the hour, but for now we're going to squeeze in a quick call.
[02:01:00.324 --> 02:01:03.186]  American in North Carolina, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:01:04.387 --> 02:01:06.208]  Yeah, I'd like to talk about Ebola and how it's
[02:01:07.515 --> 02:01:14.537]  It's the main topic in all the mainstream articles along with Jesse Matthew and the Secret Service.
[02:01:15.257 --> 02:01:19.358]  And at the bottom of all that, in the small fine print, is enterovirus.
[02:01:20.039 --> 02:01:27.461]  And that's probably what people really ought to be concerned with is, you know, Ebola's really not going to hit America that hard because we're not third world.
[02:01:28.041 --> 02:01:32.702]  But enterovirus already killed the first victim in Rhode Island.
[02:01:32.742 --> 02:01:34.763]  And I think, you know, a man might be trying to
[02:01:35.546 --> 02:01:38.167]  Trying to divert us on the Secret Service front.
[02:01:38.648 --> 02:01:45.431]  Those people, uh, the Secret Service, man, they did the righteous call on not killing, you know, a citizen, an American.
[02:01:45.971 --> 02:01:49.773]  Whereas, you know, the state police like South Carolina, they got no problem with it.
[02:01:50.253 --> 02:01:51.574]  So I'd like to commend them for that.
[02:01:52.895 --> 02:01:55.638]  Yeah, I mean, this enterovirus thing's really concerning.
[02:01:55.678 --> 02:02:01.584]  We've got an article out of CNN, enterovirus D68 found in four patients who have died, including 10-year-old girl.
[02:02:02.145 --> 02:02:09.633]  Samples collected from four patients who recently died have tested positive for the enterovirus D68, according to the CDC.
[02:02:10.134 --> 02:02:13.557]  So this is actually killing people, you know, Ebola is not killing anyone yet.
[02:02:14.378 --> 02:02:25.585]  This is of greater immediate concern, but again, obviously Ebola could have the greater, wider concern, but this, as you said, is something that is getting buried under the radar.
[02:02:25.885 --> 02:02:26.545]  Thanks for the call.
[02:02:26.585 --> 02:02:28.106]  Jeremiah in California.
[02:02:28.146 --> 02:02:29.027]  Go ahead, Jeremiah.
[02:02:29.967 --> 02:02:32.248]  Yes, I have a couple quick comments, please.
[02:02:32.729 --> 02:02:34.730]  I was wondering your take on this.
[02:02:34.830 --> 02:02:41.614]  I was listening to Joseph Israel, and he was saying that everyone who does not support the New World Order
[02:02:42.301 --> 02:02:51.847]  Will not be able to buy or sell, so they're just going to get out of the New World Order, and everyone who stays in the New World Order is going to go down with the system.
[02:02:52.928 --> 02:03:05.336]  And also, the cure for Ebola would be anything that cures a virus, like vitamin C, lemon, grapefruit, or turmeric, or tangerine, cinnamon, ginger.
[02:03:06.076 --> 02:03:09.018]  It's a virus, so anything that cures a virus,
[02:03:09.773 --> 02:03:10.994]  Um, could cure the Ebola.
[02:03:11.314 --> 02:03:17.237]  And also, I think Alex should stay in the radio studio and give the reporters the TV studio.
[02:03:17.277 --> 02:03:21.439]  He does a, he has a great, uh, vibe and environment in his radio studio.
[02:03:21.459 --> 02:03:34.266]  I think Alex enjoys being in the, in the radio studio, but I mean, the new studio that they've just built is really professional, so that's why he also enjoys doing his special reports in there.
[02:03:34.946 --> 02:03:37.087]  We've got Hap in Minnesota.
[02:03:37.167 --> 02:03:37.828]  Hap, go ahead.
[02:03:40.256 --> 02:03:40.456]  Yeah.
[02:03:40.476 --> 02:03:41.117]  Hey, welcome.
[02:03:41.477 --> 02:03:43.058]  Welcome to the U.S.
[02:03:43.299 --> 02:03:44.279]  Paul Joseph.
[02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:46.761]  Nice to hear from you always, Michael.
[02:03:46.781 --> 02:03:51.125]  Hey, I was, I was, you know, I've been thinking about this for some time now.
[02:03:51.445 --> 02:03:55.829]  You know, two months ago, you just talked about it, Michael, about the guy, the two people
[02:03:56.369 --> 02:03:56.850]  I don't know.
[02:04:13.050 --> 02:04:16.192]  The other thing is, you know, it's a great cover-up, isn't it?
[02:04:16.512 --> 02:04:21.134]  Nobody's talking about the VA or the IRS or Fast and Furious at the moment.
[02:04:21.534 --> 02:04:24.656]  So it's all, you know, it's like the page has been turned once again.
[02:04:25.116 --> 02:04:32.900]  Once again, I say, because, you know, their cover-ups or their scandals are just stacking chapter after chapter on top of each other.
[02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:34.781]  And just one more quick note.
[02:04:35.181 --> 02:04:38.363]  My brother from South America, he fled a long time ago.
[02:04:38.983 --> 02:04:47.067]  He mentioned I should start making Ebola concert t-shirts with all the dates of the cities that Ebola is going to come and hit in the U.S.
[02:04:48.007 --> 02:04:49.528]  Thanks for everything, guys.
[02:04:50.569 --> 02:04:51.349]  Thanks for the call.
[02:04:51.449 --> 02:04:54.330]  We'll be back after the break with Lionel.
[02:04:54.350 --> 02:04:58.312]  We're going to be taking your calls as well on the line for Lionel.
[02:04:58.352 --> 02:04:59.713]  LionelMedia.com.
[02:05:00.093 --> 02:05:00.633]  Stay tuned.

[02:05:03.815 --> 02:05:05.576]  InfoWars.com.
[02:05:05.616 --> 02:05:06.156]  Don't go away.
[02:05:09.969 --> 02:05:11.190]  What are you waiting for?
[02:05:11.430 --> 02:05:16.254]  You've heard what the proprietary Super Male Vitality formulation has done for others.

[02:06:10.632 --> 02:06:16.015]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:06:17.256 --> 02:06:22.019]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:06:22.419 --> 02:06:29.203]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:06:31.144 --> 02:06:33.305]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:06:34.006 --> 02:06:37.168]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.

[02:06:51.435 --> 02:06:52.936]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:06:53.216 --> 02:06:55.798]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[02:07:05.424 --> 02:07:06.865]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:07:07.025 --> 02:07:07.465]  Got it.
[02:07:07.805 --> 02:07:08.626]  Others don't.
[02:07:09.813 --> 02:07:16.858]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:07:16.978 --> 02:07:19.120]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:24.424]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:07:24.604 --> 02:07:29.608]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:07:29.768 --> 02:07:32.790]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:07:33.070 --> 02:07:36.932]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:07:37.152 --> 02:07:41.394]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:07:41.474 --> 02:07:51.499]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:07:51.699 --> 02:07:54.220]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs
[02:07:54.420 --> 02:07:55.781]  I see the red moon rising
[02:08:19.634 --> 02:08:25.748]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:08:26.089 --> 02:08:27.954]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:35.131 --> 02:08:38.814]  It's the Alex Jones Show, live from Austin, Texas.
[02:08:38.994 --> 02:08:42.216]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson, filling in for Alex Jones.
[02:08:42.236 --> 02:08:47.360]  We're going to be taking your calls in the next half an hour for Lionel at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:08:51.243 --> 02:08:58.445]  But Lionel is a nationally syndicated radio host and television personality, as well as media commentator.
[02:08:58.465 --> 02:09:01.686]  You can check him out at lionelmedia.com.
[02:09:01.806 --> 02:09:07.928]  Also does a series of great YouTube videos, which we occasionally feature on infowars.com.
[02:09:07.968 --> 02:09:11.569]  And of course, he's been a regular guest over the past couple of months.
[02:09:12.149 --> 02:09:13.389]  Lionel, welcome to the show!
[02:09:13.890 --> 02:09:14.610]  But never!
[02:09:15.882 --> 02:09:19.303]  Paul Joseph Watson, or as the last caller called you, Michael.
[02:09:19.864 --> 02:09:20.384]  Michael.
[02:09:20.504 --> 02:09:24.985]  Is this some kind of a code, some type of a black ops, Michael?
[02:09:25.346 --> 02:09:28.627]  There must be some conspiracy behind it.
[02:09:29.127 --> 02:09:32.868]  But let me just, first, kudos to you, my friend.
[02:09:33.289 --> 02:09:36.530]  Excellent, excellent, excellent job.
[02:09:37.509 --> 02:09:38.090]  Touche.
[02:09:38.110 --> 02:09:38.670]  Bravo.
[02:09:39.011 --> 02:09:40.172]  You're too kind, Lionel.
[02:09:40.673 --> 02:09:41.894]  I'm not being too kind.
[02:09:42.254 --> 02:09:43.355]  This is tough stuff.
[02:09:43.756 --> 02:09:56.029]  If you were doing conventional talk radio, you could be talking about the Jew Dices from Real Housewives of New Jersey being sentenced, or Derek Jeter's farewell, or maybe some other
[02:09:57.205 --> 02:09:59.366]  None irrelevant.
[02:09:59.626 --> 02:10:03.988]  But you're talking about pandemics, death, the new black plague.
[02:10:05.009 --> 02:10:06.049]  That's rather toxic.
[02:10:06.430 --> 02:10:07.070]  Good for you.
[02:10:07.510 --> 02:10:07.930]  Excellent.
[02:10:08.130 --> 02:10:08.891]  Excellent job, sir.
[02:10:09.231 --> 02:10:13.833]  I guess we should be talking about Chelsea Clinton's baby or something like that.
[02:10:13.913 --> 02:10:15.474]  Incredible timing, don't you think?
[02:10:16.494 --> 02:10:17.355]  How did they do that?
[02:10:17.975 --> 02:10:18.896]  But I'll tell you something.
[02:10:19.076 --> 02:10:19.536]  I want to.
[02:10:19.576 --> 02:10:25.479]  And also, please, Michael, let me catch your nickname from now on.
[02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:29.142]  Alex gives me enough nicknames, I've got enough as it is.
[02:10:29.682 --> 02:10:33.645]  I can imagine, we'll call you Misha to make it sound more... More European.
[02:10:34.186 --> 02:10:35.086]  Porky Parkish.
[02:10:35.467 --> 02:10:48.477]  But anyway, your treatises, your disquisitions, your journalistic pieces have been superb, and I've told people, so much is it, read what he is saying.
[02:10:48.637 --> 02:10:49.438]  Read his
[02:10:50.768 --> 02:10:53.290]  Meaning you, read your work.
[02:10:54.211 --> 02:11:01.117]  And when you first read the actual subject matter, you think, oh, come on, this guy's gone off the reservation.
[02:11:01.177 --> 02:11:05.281]  Now, I mean, finally, Paul Joseph Watson, a.k.a.
[02:11:05.882 --> 02:11:08.003]  Misha, has finally lost it!
[02:11:08.424 --> 02:11:15.090]  And then you read it, and again, it is cited, documented, linked,
[02:11:16.500 --> 02:11:17.000]  I think.
[02:11:34.244 --> 02:11:34.484]  Never!
[02:11:34.905 --> 02:11:37.606]  It's always, no, no, here is the story, here is what I've heard.
[02:11:38.006 --> 02:11:42.368]  So again, I'm always, I'm always defending you, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:11:42.508 --> 02:11:44.709]  I'm always defending all of that Alex Jones.
[02:11:45.169 --> 02:11:46.750]  He's, he's what?
[02:11:47.090 --> 02:11:47.570]  He's what?
[02:11:47.671 --> 02:11:49.331]  Well, he's, uh, he's what?
[02:11:49.992 --> 02:11:51.372]  Is he ecclesiastical?
[02:11:51.652 --> 02:11:52.673]  He acts like a reverend?
[02:11:52.733 --> 02:11:53.213]  Is that it?
[02:11:53.553 --> 02:11:56.715]  Now, if you're on a religious show, and you say the same thing,
[02:11:57.495 --> 02:12:07.681]  And you start speaking in tongues on a Sunday morning, and I, in no way, in any way trying to impugn people of faith, but you can say the same thing, and yet, that is okay.
[02:12:07.962 --> 02:12:17.007]  But when you're vitriolic, you're hyperbolic, you're excited, you're perhaps exaggerated by some standards, then people say, this guy's off the reservation.
[02:12:17.248 --> 02:12:23.672]  And the reason why is because we're used to the news being so bloody boring.
[02:12:24.552 --> 02:12:28.335]  Absolutely just soporific.
[02:12:28.915 --> 02:12:32.658]  Just, you know, radio or TV version of Ambien.
[02:12:32.678 --> 02:12:34.659]  But I gotta tell you something.
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:49.430]  You brought up something last week, which I... Again, I find myself three times a day at least saying, what kind of a parallel... I was just telling Nico on the break, what kind of a parallel universe am I in?
[02:12:50.170 --> 02:12:50.571]  What is that?
[02:12:51.131 --> 02:12:53.112]  Why doesn't anybody run out in the street and say,
[02:12:54.676 --> 02:12:56.297]  David Cameron before the UN.
[02:12:56.457 --> 02:12:57.657]  You're David Cameron!
[02:12:57.857 --> 02:12:58.998]  You're David Cameron!
[02:12:59.558 --> 02:13:00.698]  Not mine, yours!
[02:13:01.819 --> 02:13:03.199]  Don't lump him on me, Lionel.
[02:13:05.900 --> 02:13:14.144]  He stood up and he said, he basically dusted off the cognitive infiltration theme, which we'll get to.
[02:13:15.264 --> 02:13:20.186]  And in front of the UN, dusted off this, I thought,
[02:13:21.610 --> 02:13:27.876]  Horry, uh, Antediluvian, ancient idea about going after conspiracy theories.
[02:13:27.896 --> 02:13:33.261]  You would think somebody in the group would say, listen, D.C., come here, lose that talk.
[02:13:33.922 --> 02:13:40.468]  You're really, this is the United States, I know this is the U.N., but don't talk about telling people if they opine about 7-7 or 9-11 that somehow they're
[02:13:43.154 --> 02:13:46.115]  They're practicing non-violent extremism?
[02:13:46.775 --> 02:13:48.355]  Let's play the clip, Lionel.
[02:13:48.375 --> 02:13:50.196]  Let's play the clip now and we can talk about it.
[02:13:50.236 --> 02:13:52.516]  Here's David Cameron in front of the UN.
[02:13:52.556 --> 02:13:53.076]  Roll the clip.
[02:13:53.737 --> 02:13:57.017]  We must defeat this ideology in all its forms.
[02:13:58.338 --> 02:14:03.539]  As evidence emerges about the backgrounds of those convicted of terrorist offences,
[02:14:04.500 --> 02:14:15.818]  It is clear that many of them were initially influenced by preachers who claim not to encourage violence, but whose worldview can be used as a justification for it.
[02:14:16.929 --> 02:14:18.290]  We know this worldview.
[02:14:19.050 --> 02:14:20.270]  The peddling of lies.
[02:14:20.851 --> 02:14:23.212]  That 9-11 was somehow a Jewish plot.
[02:14:23.792 --> 02:14:26.633]  Or that the 7-7 London attacks were staged.
[02:14:27.434 --> 02:14:33.336]  The idea that Muslims are persecuted all over the world as a deliberate act of Western policy.
[02:14:34.216 --> 02:14:37.798]  The concept of an inevitable clash of civilizations.
[02:14:38.938 --> 02:14:39.699]  We must be clear.
[02:14:40.501 --> 02:14:48.603]  To defeat the ideology of extremism, we need to deal with all forms of extremism, not just violent extremism.
[02:14:49.733 --> 02:14:52.876]  For governments, there are some obvious ways we can do this.
[02:14:53.536 --> 02:14:54.177]  Okay, that's enough.
[02:14:54.197 --> 02:15:12.393]  We must ban preachers... Lionel, three days after that, I believe, the Home Secretary, Theresa May, came out in the UK and added to that, said that basically anyone who wants to use Twitter or Facebook, who is a domestic extremist in their words, a non-violent extremist, would have to get government permission to do so.
[02:15:13.194 --> 02:15:19.720]  I mean, this is creepy, it's Orwellian, but as you said, the very fact that he's talking about it would raise suspicions.
[02:15:19.780 --> 02:15:28.127]  I mean, that would make people believe that 7-7 and 9-11 were in some way staged, if they're having to go to these lengths to censor people.
[02:15:28.347 --> 02:15:29.908]  That's precisely right!
[02:15:30.789 --> 02:15:38.801]  If he were to say, well, I know many of you today believe that I am a reptilian sorcerer.
[02:15:39.102 --> 02:15:39.362]  What?
[02:15:39.522 --> 02:15:40.464]  No, we didn't think that.
[02:15:40.524 --> 02:15:44.991]  Why would... And I know to you who think that I'm daft.
[02:15:45.371 --> 02:15:45.832]  No, I...
[02:15:46.773 --> 02:15:47.734]  Maybe we should!
[02:15:48.094 --> 02:16:04.945]  Look, I thought, and I'm sorry, but for that terrible accent, I in no way want to appear anglophobic or whatever the particular phrase is, but he's speaking before the UN, whatever that's worth, and this is what he comes up with.
[02:16:05.706 --> 02:16:07.967]  Let's hearken back to the granddaddy of all.
[02:16:08.508 --> 02:16:09.809]  The granddaddy of all.
[02:16:10.569 --> 02:16:16.213]  One of the most frightening pieces of either juridical or legal or academic
[02:16:17.103 --> 02:16:32.294]  Balderdash, Buncombe, and Huey was a piece co-written by Cass R. Sunstein and Adrian Vermeule, I'm pronouncing this incorrectly, both from Harvard Law School, entitled Conspiracy Theory.
[02:16:32.914 --> 02:16:35.856]  This, this is the Magna Carta.
[02:16:36.617 --> 02:16:37.698]  This was in 2008.
[02:16:38.598 --> 02:16:44.963]  And if you, if I could, and I don't like reading things, but you have, there's no way I could
[02:16:46.714 --> 02:16:50.696]  Michael, do this justice, without reading.
[02:16:50.896 --> 02:16:53.117]  This is from the Pracy or the abstract.
[02:16:54.457 --> 02:16:58.539]  Many millions of people hold conspiracy theories.
[02:16:59.179 --> 02:17:11.064]  They believe that powerful people have worked together in order to withhold the truth about some important practice or some terrible event.
[02:17:11.464 --> 02:17:12.244]  Stop right there.
[02:17:13.365 --> 02:17:13.985]  That's history.
[02:17:14.744 --> 02:17:15.765]  Go through history.
[02:17:16.606 --> 02:17:22.711]  Governments, people, organizations, holding back the truth.
[02:17:24.553 --> 02:17:36.924]  This is the subject matter of an academic treatise on where did these people come up with this plum crazy idea that governments... What has your whole show been today?
[02:17:37.606 --> 02:17:38.708]  It's about Ebola!
[02:17:39.329 --> 02:17:46.301]  And the lies, the prevarication, the harm that is being hidden.
[02:17:46.922 --> 02:17:48.806]  But let me just... This is what he says.
[02:17:49.166 --> 02:17:49.447]  I must.
[02:17:50.939 --> 02:17:59.406]  Those who subscribe to conspiracy theories may create serious risks, including risks of violence.
[02:17:59.946 --> 02:18:07.632]  And the existence of such theories raises questions, raises significant challenges for policy and law.
[02:18:07.792 --> 02:18:14.437]  The first challenge is to understand, understand the mechanisms by which conspiracy theories prosper.
[02:18:14.897 --> 02:18:20.282]  The second challenge is to understand how such theories might be undermined.
[02:18:21.345 --> 02:18:24.586]  Now, he's talking about, not only do we want to understand, okay, fine.
[02:18:25.227 --> 02:18:29.589]  We can talk about, why are people superstitious, why are people, whatever.
[02:18:30.169 --> 02:18:31.209]  Fine, I understand that.
[02:18:31.930 --> 02:18:33.590]  But how can we undermine them?
[02:18:34.511 --> 02:18:36.591]  Here is the important, and I'll just leave it at this.
[02:18:38.372 --> 02:18:44.135]  Because those who hold conspiracy theories typically suffer from a crippled epistemology.
[02:18:45.475 --> 02:18:47.056]  A crippled epistemology.
[02:18:48.095 --> 02:18:55.139]  In accordance with which it is rational to hold such theories, the best response... Let me stop right there.
[02:18:55.419 --> 02:18:57.360]  This is Obama's regulations czar.
[02:18:57.721 --> 02:18:59.362]  This is the husband of Samantha Power.
[02:19:00.062 --> 02:19:06.966]  This is a noted legal heavyweight, rock star, juridical and academic bigwig.
[02:19:07.566 --> 02:19:17.052]  He says, the best response consists in cognitive infiltration of extremist groups.
[02:19:18.427 --> 02:19:32.238]  Paul Joseph Watson, every single thing that you talk about, I talk about, that anybody talks about, could, by any stretch of the imagination, be construed as extreme.
[02:19:32.838 --> 02:19:35.160]  Extreme by what standard?
[02:19:35.641 --> 02:19:42.026]  I am a lawyer by trade, and a statute is per se unconstitutional.
[02:19:42.466 --> 02:19:50.171]  When it is susceptible to reasons, to explanations, to interpretations that are inconsistent, that you read and you're not sure.
[02:19:50.191 --> 02:19:52.072]  For example, the statute that says, do no wrong.
[02:19:52.513 --> 02:19:53.173]  I don't know what that means.
[02:19:53.713 --> 02:19:55.895]  Paul Joseph Watson, what is extreme?
[02:19:55.915 --> 02:19:59.537]  Can truth be extreme?
[02:19:59.637 --> 02:20:01.439]  That's the question we'll ask after the break.
[02:20:01.479 --> 02:20:02.699]  Lionel, stay there.
[02:20:02.880 --> 02:20:05.881]  It's the Alex Jones Show live, InfoWars.com.
[02:20:05.922 --> 02:20:07.302]  We'll be back with your calls.
[02:20:07.342 --> 02:20:07.903]  Don't go away.
[02:20:10.570 --> 02:20:11.531]  Our big story.
[02:20:11.791 --> 02:20:16.675]  Gun owners react as politicians continue to ban high-capacity magazines state by state.
[02:20:16.815 --> 02:20:19.718]  I think that these weapons ought to be stopped.
[02:20:19.918 --> 02:20:22.460]  Magazine restrictions have already happened in nine states.
[02:20:22.720 --> 02:20:29.446]  Staffed with formal special operations personnel, GunMagWarehouse.com is the only company that specializes in gun magazines.

[02:20:39.824 --> 02:20:40.864]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:20:40.944 --> 02:20:45.265]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:20:45.445 --> 02:20:51.046]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:20:51.146 --> 02:20:53.247]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet.
[02:20:53.307 --> 02:20:54.487]  No word about IRAs.
[02:20:54.727 --> 02:20:57.288]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:57.388 --> 02:21:02.209]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[02:21:09.150 --> 02:21:13.492]  On September 30, 2014, the first confirmed case of Ebola appeared in the U.S.
[02:21:13.812 --> 02:21:25.816]  This, combined with several other unidentified viruses, have some of our customers at 30dayfoodsupply.com concerned about the safety of our domestic food supply, resulting in a surge of our $99.90 serving kits.
[02:21:26.156 --> 02:21:36.120]  While we at 30dayfoodsupply.com have no expertise in epidemiology, we are aggressively purchasing raw materials that are currently in stock and we intend to continue to sell

[02:22:19.324 --> 02:22:25.347]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male, and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[02:22:42.814 --> 02:22:47.418]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[02:22:47.558 --> 02:22:48.559]  Talk about the effects.
[02:22:48.879 --> 02:22:50.361]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[02:22:50.381 --> 02:22:52.002]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[02:22:52.323 --> 02:22:53.383]  I feel like I look better.
[02:22:53.443 --> 02:22:54.084]  I feel better.
[02:22:54.144 --> 02:22:55.165]  I feel sexier.
[02:22:55.185 --> 02:22:55.926]  I love it.
[02:22:56.166 --> 02:22:59.068]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[02:22:59.149 --> 02:23:01.831]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[02:23:02.051 --> 02:23:03.092]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:23:03.132 --> 02:23:04.173]  Consult your physician.
[02:23:04.313 --> 02:23:06.516]  Visit InfoWarsLive.com today.
[02:23:06.676 --> 02:23:07.617]  This is life-changing.
[02:23:07.937 --> 02:23:10.640]  Americans, prepare for financial ruin.
[02:23:11.101 --> 02:23:14.985]  That is what one of the world's richest men, Donald Trump, said just a few weeks ago.
[02:23:15.265 --> 02:23:16.546]  What are you doing to prepare?
[02:23:16.566 --> 02:23:19.930]  The problems that caused the last financial crisis were never fixed.
[02:23:20.430 --> 02:23:21.771]  In fact, they're even worse now.
[02:23:21.971 --> 02:23:23.372]  The total amount of debt in the U.S.
[02:23:23.392 --> 02:23:26.615]  has grown by more than 57% since September 2008.
[02:23:26.975 --> 02:23:39.044]  The too-big-to-fail banks are much larger, and the massive derivatives bubble is spiraling so far out of control that the only thing left to do is watch the spectacular crash landing that is inevitably coming.
[02:23:39.344 --> 02:23:47.467]  If you're a baby boomer with retirement funds, it's time you consider exiting the Wall Street casino and start a cash-flowing international business of your own.
[02:23:47.727 --> 02:23:53.969]  There may be ways to preserve your wealth, but history has shown that few things can grow your wealth like having your own business.
[02:23:54.169 --> 02:23:55.110]  The crash is coming.
[02:23:55.430 --> 02:23:57.711]  Take measures now to soften the landing.
[02:23:58.011 --> 02:24:00.732]  Go to BabyBoomerBackupPlan.com or call 888-507-8789.
[02:24:00.792 --> 02:24:02.352]  That's BabyBoomerBackupPlan.com.
[02:24:28.030 --> 02:24:32.614]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show with Lionel of LionelMedia.com.
[02:24:32.634 --> 02:24:35.316]  We're going to be taking a few of your calls for Lionel at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:35.436 --> 02:24:36.117]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:36.137 --> 02:24:37.838]  So get those lined up for the next segment.
[02:24:37.958 --> 02:24:41.241]  We just played a clip of David Cameron in front of the United Nations last week.
[02:24:48.567 --> 02:24:50.489]  Basically he was talking about ISIS.
[02:24:50.749 --> 02:24:58.416]  He made a comparison basically saying that anybody who is a non-violent extremist is in the same category as ISIS.
[02:24:58.476 --> 02:25:01.279]  What did he characterize as a non-violent extremist?
[02:25:01.779 --> 02:25:08.145]  Basically anyone who questions the government narrative on events such as the 7-7 attacks in London
[02:25:08.946 --> 02:25:09.907]  Or 9-11.
[02:25:09.947 --> 02:25:15.073]  So it's basically this process, and we asked the question before the break, what is considered extreme?
[02:25:15.654 --> 02:25:22.821]  This process of creating a new brand of thought crime, to in fact brand individuals who espouse it.
[02:25:23.971 --> 02:25:38.821]  Any questioning of the government narrative whatsoever is not only a conspiracy theory anymore, which they've used as that pejorative term to demonize free thought, to demonize the questioning of any motive of any person in a position of power.
[02:25:39.261 --> 02:25:43.924]  Now they've gone one step further, Lionel, and are saying that you could be in league
[02:25:44.344 --> 02:25:45.344]  With the terrorists?
[02:25:45.404 --> 02:25:49.766]  I mean, we saw after 9-11, we must never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories, George W. Bush.
[02:25:50.166 --> 02:25:58.870]  Now they're saying that we could be in league with the terrorists by espousing this dangerous notion of questioning government.
[02:25:59.350 --> 02:26:00.690]  How extreme is that?
[02:26:01.011 --> 02:26:02.951]  Let me ask you this, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:26:03.171 --> 02:26:10.394]  Let's say I were to question the government, and I hate air quotes, but I will do it.
[02:26:11.215 --> 02:26:12.235]  I question the government
[02:26:12.930 --> 02:26:17.955]  Not out of any kind of nefarious wrongdoing, but let's just say I think they're inept.
[02:26:18.555 --> 02:26:23.440]  Let's say that I question the Warren Commission.
[02:26:24.304 --> 02:26:29.989]  Now, another question is, is there a statute of limitations to my questioning the government?
[02:26:30.269 --> 02:26:37.555]  If I question the findings of the Maine in 1898, there was certainly complicity, I think we all can understand that.
[02:26:38.096 --> 02:26:49.826]  If I were to question the United States' role in, let's say, Operation Ajax, the overthrow of Mosaddegh, oh, by the way, another question is,
[02:26:50.595 --> 02:26:57.017]  Let's say I were to question something now, and something is declassified.
[02:26:57.817 --> 02:27:05.780]  So imagine a Paul Joseph Watson in the era of Mosaddegh and the Shah, who says, I think the CIA was involved in that.
[02:27:06.480 --> 02:27:10.943]  Under this theory, were it to be enacted, Paul Joseph Watson, a.k.a.
[02:27:11.023 --> 02:27:13.164]  Michael, is incarcerated!
[02:27:13.844 --> 02:27:18.347]  Now, years later, the CIA declassifies it and says, you know what?
[02:27:18.827 --> 02:27:19.347]  We were right.
[02:27:19.747 --> 02:27:20.828]  Do we let you out?
[02:27:21.568 --> 02:27:24.910]  Isn't that called academic quest?
[02:27:27.552 --> 02:27:32.215]  Because I can question, and not 9-11, but I can question anything.
[02:27:32.295 --> 02:27:40.780]  I can question the government in saying that Agent Orange was far more lethal, and teratogenic in a problematic, and depleted uranium, and DU.
[02:27:41.180 --> 02:27:51.947]  I'm not saying the government, I could be questioning the finding based on ineptitude, bad sample size, I could have a pretty clinical way.
[02:27:52.287 --> 02:27:54.809]  So this broad brush
[02:27:55.669 --> 02:28:03.934]  Uh, admonition, don't question your elders, uh, covers everything from the most benign disagreement.
[02:28:04.754 --> 02:28:05.555]  Let me ask you this.
[02:28:06.135 --> 02:28:14.760]  Last week, Senator, uh, uh, uh, uh, Bob Graham of the 9th Amendment Commission said, I want this redacted testimony back.
[02:28:15.561 --> 02:28:15.881]  I want it.
[02:28:16.810 --> 02:28:20.693]  known regarding Saudi Arabia's involvement in 9-11.
[02:28:21.493 --> 02:28:23.675]  Is that non-violent extremism?
[02:28:24.115 --> 02:28:28.118]  Is he not calling into question his own commission?
[02:28:29.058 --> 02:28:32.381]  Is this internal non-violent extremism?
[02:28:32.461 --> 02:28:34.882]  Is he an internal conspiracy theorist?
[02:28:35.443 --> 02:28:36.984]  Is he questioning himself?
[02:28:38.445 --> 02:28:39.666]  I mean, think about this.
[02:28:40.146 --> 02:28:41.327]  It is our duty
[02:28:42.665 --> 02:28:49.368]  It is our duty, it is inherent, it is in our DNA to question authority, question anything, and you know why?
[02:28:49.868 --> 02:28:51.089]  Because we want to.
[02:28:51.709 --> 02:28:52.409]  I don't need permission.
[02:28:52.549 --> 02:28:55.151]  And by the way, I find this fascinating.
[02:28:55.891 --> 02:29:02.614]  As you know, Paul, there are brilliant people out there who, by virtue of having these newfangled devices that we're talking on,
[02:29:03.686 --> 02:29:04.747]  Can look at something.
[02:29:05.047 --> 02:29:11.470]  Remember when they said, look at the video of this horrible ISIS or ISIL or Daesh or Sham.
[02:29:11.530 --> 02:29:14.411]  I mean, the names grow.
[02:29:14.631 --> 02:29:19.834]  Remember when Gaddafi was ultimately spelled 38 different ways.
[02:29:20.194 --> 02:29:21.034]  We like to do that.
[02:29:21.135 --> 02:29:25.997]  But the reason why I think they want to ask you, don't go back and look at these videos.
[02:29:26.840 --> 02:29:31.721]  Because you might see some glaring problem in some bad editing.
[02:29:31.921 --> 02:29:32.701]  It's very clever.
[02:29:32.941 --> 02:29:35.242]  So don't look at the videos that we've put out.
[02:29:35.702 --> 02:29:36.462]  Don't question it.
[02:29:37.282 --> 02:29:37.763]  Don't ask.
[02:29:37.963 --> 02:29:38.463]  Don't talk.
[02:29:38.563 --> 02:29:39.083]  Don't speak.
[02:29:39.423 --> 02:29:41.964]  Just nod in hypnotic obeisance.
[02:29:42.824 --> 02:29:45.164]  Your calls for Lionel coming up after the break.
[02:29:45.224 --> 02:29:46.425]  LionelMedia.com.
[02:29:46.445 --> 02:29:50.746]  We're going to talk about media narratives and the collapse of trust in the mainstream media.
[02:29:51.086 --> 02:29:52.726]  This is the Alex Jones Show live.
[02:29:53.106 --> 02:29:54.407]  InfoWars.com.
[02:29:54.447 --> 02:29:55.427]  Your calls coming up.
[02:29:55.507 --> 02:29:56.207]  Stay tuned.
[02:29:59.381 --> 02:30:02.372]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.315 --> 02:30:06.004]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.376 --> 02:30:19.902]  Using unparalleled research and the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[02:30:20.022 --> 02:30:29.787]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[02:30:29.947 --> 02:30:32.869]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[02:30:33.089 --> 02:30:33.710]  I think so.
[02:30:55.811 --> 02:30:56.672]  Another major health threat.
[02:31:11.613 --> 02:31:16.497]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:31:16.577 --> 02:31:19.240]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:31:19.260 --> 02:31:26.026]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:31:26.306 --> 02:31:29.169]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:31:29.189 --> 02:31:32.232]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:31:32.252 --> 02:31:34.233]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:31:34.253 --> 02:31:37.076]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:31:37.176 --> 02:31:42.680]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:31:42.900 --> 02:31:46.403]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:31:46.423 --> 02:31:49.385]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:31:49.505 --> 02:31:53.788]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have.
[02:31:53.928 --> 02:31:56.589]  For every modern, independently minded household.
[02:31:56.809 --> 02:31:59.871]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.
[02:32:00.031 --> 02:32:06.354]  Go to Infowarsstore.com today to purchase your ProPure Pro1 G2.0 water filtration system.
[02:32:06.454 --> 02:32:07.034]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:32:10.851 --> 02:32:14.353]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:32:14.513 --> 02:32:18.475]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:32:18.775 --> 02:32:20.236]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:32:20.556 --> 02:32:28.140]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:32:28.420 --> 02:32:29.261]  But for how long?
[02:32:29.561 --> 02:32:35.824]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:32:36.204 --> 02:32:39.006]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[02:32:40.464 --> 02:32:41.484]  DNA Force.
[02:32:41.524 --> 02:32:44.726]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:32:44.806 --> 02:32:45.826]  DNA Force.
[02:32:45.946 --> 02:32:53.990]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:32:54.110 --> 02:32:59.152]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:32:59.192 --> 02:33:00.193]  DNA Force.
[02:33:00.233 --> 02:33:02.094]  We now have the synergistic solution.
[02:33:02.234 --> 02:33:06.575]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:33:06.595 --> 02:33:07.396]  DNA Force.
[02:33:22.606 --> 02:33:24.747]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:25.207 --> 02:33:26.627]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:34.590 --> 02:33:36.991]  It's the Alex Jones Show, live with Lionel.
[02:33:37.011 --> 02:33:37.871]  Your call's coming up.
[02:33:38.011 --> 02:33:41.432]  First, I just want to mention again, Infowarsstore.com.
[02:33:41.452 --> 02:33:42.752]  We've got Oxy Powder.
[02:33:42.772 --> 02:33:46.594]  Again, this is a product that cleans you out while you sleep with gentle oxygen.
[02:33:46.694 --> 02:33:49.394]  It's not one of these harsh, herbal colon cleansers.
[02:33:49.414 --> 02:33:50.855]  There are no nasty side effects.
[02:33:51.415 --> 02:34:02.801]  And again, reclaim responsibility, reclaim power over your life by becoming healthy, by boosting your immune system against all the allergies, all the toxins in the environment.
[02:34:03.261 --> 02:34:08.664]  This is one of a line of products that we've got here at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:34:09.385 --> 02:34:16.649]  It's the only colon cleansing product with ingredients backed by real clinical studies on safety and we've just got a new shipment in today.
[02:34:17.569 --> 02:34:21.232]  That's OxyPowder, InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:34:21.432 --> 02:34:39.807]  Again, crucial, this is what, this is the fuel that drives the InfoWars juggernaut, helps us out, pay for all the equipment, all the huge bandwidth costs and everything, hire new reporters, expand and dominate the mainstream media, dominate the establishment, which is what we're talking about.
[02:34:40.248 --> 02:34:43.630]  With Lionel, we played before the break, David Cameron saying in front of the UN,
[02:34:44.591 --> 02:34:49.613]  Nonviolent extremism includes anyone who questions government narratives.
[02:34:49.693 --> 02:34:55.976]  And to me, Lionel, I mean, on Twitter, we often see mainstream talking heads lashing out.
[02:34:56.156 --> 02:35:00.538]  It's always fun to abuse them on Twitter, like I did with Keith Olbermann.
[02:35:00.878 --> 02:35:03.139]  But often they come to me.
[02:35:03.199 --> 02:35:07.081]  They lash out against Infowars without even, you know, being prodded in the first place.
[02:35:07.101 --> 02:35:13.084]  You mentioned Cass Sunstein with the cognitive infiltration, subverting the so-called conspiracy movement.
[02:35:13.644 --> 02:35:21.791]  This just suggests to me nothing else but how insecure they are about being challenged on any narrative whatsoever.
[02:35:21.911 --> 02:35:24.913]  What does it say to you about their insecurity?
[02:35:25.433 --> 02:35:40.505]  Well, first and foremost, you mentioned Twitter, and a shameless plug for mine, and I watch, I tweet, retweet, and favorite, and if I could do something else to add approbation to your tweets, I would, but I'm at Lionel Media, and I'm at Twitter
[02:35:41.576 --> 02:35:42.076]  Fanatic!
[02:35:42.957 --> 02:35:45.758]  I think it is the pulse and the heartbeat of the world.
[02:35:46.358 --> 02:35:49.079]  But here is the thing I don't understand.
[02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:56.622]  When, and I don't want to just make too much out of this, but how much can I question?
[02:35:56.982 --> 02:35:57.743]  Let me ask again.
[02:35:57.943 --> 02:36:01.064]  Is there a statute of limitations to that which I question?
[02:36:01.584 --> 02:36:07.747]  If I think there were very serious questions as to Vietnam and our involvement and the Gulf of Tonkin, which has been admitted
[02:36:10.368 --> 02:36:11.589]  Is that exempted?
[02:36:12.270 --> 02:36:28.446]  Next, how can somebody who is theoretically conversant with the First Amendment, a legal scholar at some of the best, ostensibly, legal or law schools in the nation,
[02:36:30.545 --> 02:36:40.435]  I dare to suggest that the government, ostensibly, should be involved in quashing and quelling and basically stifling speech.
[02:36:40.976 --> 02:36:46.682]  As you know, Paul, the First Amendment, in fact the Bill of Rights, only limits
[02:36:47.958 --> 02:36:53.501]  Action when the federal government or the state government are involved in violating your law.
[02:36:53.821 --> 02:36:57.102]  The federal government, the state government has to violate your First Amendment right.
[02:36:57.242 --> 02:36:58.423]  Not individual citizens.
[02:36:58.483 --> 02:37:06.207]  The 13th Amendment is the only bill of right, the only constitutional amendment that a private citizen can actually violate, can actually commit.
[02:37:06.527 --> 02:37:09.989]  It's the slavery or anti-slavery provision and variations thereof.
[02:37:10.229 --> 02:37:14.451]  So here we have, and just think about this, the irony of this, a law professor
[02:37:15.504 --> 02:37:19.165]  Advocating, not boycotting, which is fine.
[02:37:19.506 --> 02:37:25.808]  By God, if those conspiracy theorists out there spew this bunkum, why you tell them?
[02:37:26.068 --> 02:37:26.368]  Fine.
[02:37:26.628 --> 02:37:27.649]  Write your congressman.
[02:37:27.789 --> 02:37:28.149]  Fine.
[02:37:28.269 --> 02:37:28.749]  Petition.
[02:37:29.029 --> 02:37:29.349]  Go ahead.
[02:37:29.489 --> 02:37:30.090]  Nothing wrong with it.
[02:37:30.530 --> 02:37:36.272]  They're talking about cognitive infiltration via the government.
[02:37:37.353 --> 02:37:43.375]  This erases any doubt as to a First Amendment involvement in this.
[02:37:45.663 --> 02:37:53.806]  How can anyone not say, wait a minute, hold the press to stop, with a president who is ostensibly a constitutional professor?
[02:37:53.826 --> 02:38:06.550]  I mean, this is so blatant, so pathetic, as you say, so desperate, so much of an indicium, of an indication of how this is making headway.
[02:38:07.391 --> 02:38:07.971]  And again,
[02:38:09.372 --> 02:38:10.633]  There are so many levels.
[02:38:11.153 --> 02:38:19.658]  The word conspiracy theorist, I'd love to hearken back to the great Gore Vidal who said, I am not a conspiracy theorist, I'm a conspiracy analyst.
[02:38:20.139 --> 02:38:28.304]  And the word conspiracy theory has been basically a code word for the unspeakable truth.
[02:38:29.525 --> 02:38:32.506]  And if you're a truther,
[02:38:33.681 --> 02:38:37.682]  How did they appropriate truther as a pejorative?
[02:38:38.142 --> 02:38:38.983]  How did this happen?
[02:38:39.663 --> 02:38:41.664]  A falser, I can understand.
[02:38:41.684 --> 02:38:48.766]  And if you ask any questions, any questions from, you pick the subject.
[02:38:49.890 --> 02:39:01.042]  This is, we need to revolt violent, I mean not violently, non-violently, what am I saying, non-extremist, but say, wait a minute, no, no, we are not going to do this.
[02:39:01.242 --> 02:39:10.292]  And the best way to protest this non-violently is to fill the airways, fill the Twitter world, the ether, the social media.
[02:39:10.692 --> 02:39:12.933]  With your protestations against this idea.
[02:39:13.133 --> 02:39:23.116]  Because remember, Paul, what you were talking about this entire first portion of the show was how the government is not being straight with you and with us regarding Ebola.
[02:39:23.516 --> 02:39:24.896]  Is that a conspiracy theory?
[02:39:25.677 --> 02:39:27.837]  And if it is, who's conspiring?
[02:39:28.277 --> 02:39:29.458]  Who are the conspirators?
[02:39:30.078 --> 02:39:30.758]  I don't understand.
[02:39:31.078 --> 02:39:32.939]  You might be saying that the government's inept.
[02:39:33.592 --> 02:39:34.833]  The government's not doing its job.
[02:39:35.333 --> 02:39:36.594]  The government's dropping the ball.
[02:39:36.954 --> 02:39:40.116]  We need better CDC officials.
[02:39:40.196 --> 02:39:41.397]  We need to fund them.
[02:39:42.317 --> 02:39:42.838]  They're inept.
[02:39:43.858 --> 02:39:49.322]  That's not conspiratorial, false flag, inside job.
[02:39:49.682 --> 02:39:52.404]  You just might be saying, you guys don't know what the hell you're doing.
[02:39:52.784 --> 02:39:53.424]  It's that simple.
[02:39:54.425 --> 02:39:55.346]  We're talking with Lionel.
[02:39:55.506 --> 02:39:56.687]  LionelMedia.com.
[02:39:56.707 --> 02:39:57.967]  Mercedes in Oregon.
[02:39:57.987 --> 02:39:59.288]  You're on the air with Lionel.
[02:39:59.328 --> 02:40:00.209]  Go ahead, Mercedes.
[02:40:01.755 --> 02:40:04.477]  Hello Lionel and Paul, welcome.
[02:40:06.379 --> 02:40:14.326]  I wanted to say welcome to, you know, the States, but now you're there with Ebola, so I don't know.
[02:40:14.346 --> 02:40:18.009]  I don't personally have Ebola yet, but thank you.
[02:40:18.470 --> 02:40:23.094]  Maybe you should be going home before there's a quarantine or something.
[02:40:23.494 --> 02:40:24.955]  Maybe, maybe we'll all get locked in.
[02:40:26.368 --> 02:40:26.488]  Yeah.
[02:40:26.548 --> 02:40:29.069]  There are worse places to be locked in though, I'll say that.
[02:40:31.250 --> 02:40:33.230]  So what's your question or comment for Lionel?
[02:40:33.831 --> 02:40:35.871]  Yeah, you're definitely with good people.
[02:40:36.031 --> 02:40:39.853]  So, yeah, extremism, we have to exactly say no.
[02:40:40.593 --> 02:40:49.136]  We, not only is it info wars, but, um, we have to do a counter-narrative.
[02:40:49.276 --> 02:40:52.117]  We're the counter-narrative to what they're doing.
[02:40:53.698 --> 02:40:54.418]  They go in front
[02:40:55.620 --> 02:40:59.223]  The UN and say these horrible things, you know?
[02:40:59.243 --> 02:41:04.108]  And we're just, you know, I'm on Twitter too.
[02:41:04.128 --> 02:41:13.417]  I don't think I should be, you know, attacked in any way by the government just for saying, hey, you guys aren't doing what you're supposed to be doing.
[02:41:15.075 --> 02:41:15.916]  That's exactly the point.
[02:41:16.076 --> 02:41:17.616]  I mean, that's precisely right.
[02:41:17.797 --> 02:41:18.437]  Go ahead, Lionel.
[02:41:19.017 --> 02:41:20.438]  No, no, that's precisely right.
[02:41:20.978 --> 02:41:34.385]  And Mercedes, or where I'm from, we say Mercedes, I firmly believe that not only does the, and I say the government, I don't even know what that means.
[02:41:34.445 --> 02:41:35.386]  It's not the government.
[02:41:35.406 --> 02:41:36.666]  There are people who work for the government.
[02:41:36.686 --> 02:41:38.107]  They're fine.
[02:41:38.147 --> 02:41:39.828]  They're great patriots and wonderful.
[02:41:40.745 --> 02:41:51.327]  But we use that term to speak of a few, but I don't think people realize how big this is.
[02:41:52.868 --> 02:42:04.390]  I'm telling you right now, when you listen to me, I know people in the conventional media, in the usual nuts and bolts, beaten potato, terrestrial, old-fashioned
[02:42:06.215 --> 02:42:12.980]  Radio TV and they're living in the 50s, not the 1950s, the 50s.
[02:42:13.660 --> 02:42:16.522]  They don't know anything.
[02:42:16.582 --> 02:42:19.704]  There are the people who say, you know, I don't understand this Twitter.
[02:42:20.825 --> 02:42:25.408]  I guarantee you right now what we're saying right now.
[02:42:26.861 --> 02:42:44.688]  lives on in a cloud, in a, in a, in an area that is so huge, so colossal, so, here I invoke Gulliver, robbing Nagy and so enormous, mainstream media don't understand it.
[02:42:44.768 --> 02:42:51.051]  These people on TV who, who fancy themselves as being, you know, the cable news warriors,
[02:42:52.747 --> 02:43:04.210]  On their best day, they don't approximate this world out there that represents far more people than anybody can understand.
[02:43:04.510 --> 02:43:20.354]  So what happens is, as this, and mark my words, Mercedes and Paul, one day, and I don't know when it is, but very, very soon, tomorrow, next week, somebody of note will all of a sudden say, you know what?
[02:43:21.647 --> 02:43:24.229]  I listen to that show, and I believe in that.
[02:43:25.349 --> 02:43:27.971]  And somebody will say, wow, of note.
[02:43:28.111 --> 02:43:44.062]  You know, when Jenny McCarthy, bless her heart, became viewed as the point person for concerns people had in inoculation and vaccine-related diseases, that was a dark day in any kind of... By the way, vaxxer.
[02:43:44.082 --> 02:43:44.842]  Have you heard that, Paul?
[02:43:45.323 --> 02:43:46.083]  Vaxxers.
[02:43:46.543 --> 02:43:46.984]  Vaxxers.
[02:43:47.124 --> 02:43:48.645]  That's the new pejorative.
[02:43:48.825 --> 02:43:49.465]  Yes, yes.
[02:43:50.931 --> 02:43:56.373]  We need, eventually you're going to hear more people, Rosie O'Donnell, bless her heart, Charlie Sheen.
[02:43:58.434 --> 02:44:05.357]  They're kind of been, by virtue of a very scared media, lumped in as the standard bearers.
[02:44:05.377 --> 02:44:09.799]  You know, the bellwethers of this new... No!
[02:44:11.076 --> 02:44:13.477]  And this is not in any way a slam word pejorative against them.
[02:44:14.218 --> 02:44:20.861]  But when you start hearing people say, no, I agree with this, or I watch this, I understand this.
[02:44:20.921 --> 02:44:33.008]  When you start to see these, the Daily Shows and Colbert and others, realize that what they're doing is a cutesified, if that's a word, version of the mainstream media dreck.
[02:44:33.668 --> 02:44:39.812]  When all of a sudden, like this, this discussion becomes cool.
[02:44:40.831 --> 02:44:42.854]  And people will run to it.
[02:44:43.755 --> 02:44:47.020]  And they will say, you mean this has been there?
[02:44:47.380 --> 02:44:47.681]  Yes.
[02:44:48.201 --> 02:44:50.465]  There are more of us than them.
[02:44:52.805 --> 02:45:00.129]  A person one time, a dear friend of mine, who gave the expression, he says, you know, there are so many of us that we could drown them.
[02:45:00.269 --> 02:45:03.411]  And I know this sounds crude, but he said we could drown them in our urine.
[02:45:03.731 --> 02:45:05.733]  And I thought, oh, my God, what a horrible metaphor.
[02:45:06.093 --> 02:45:16.259]  But I realized we forget our power, the enormity of this, because most of us right now are at home or at work.
[02:45:17.268 --> 02:45:22.953]  We're listening maybe later, a week or so, a year later, and we look around and we're saying, is anybody out there?
[02:45:23.393 --> 02:45:24.094]  Oh, yes.
[02:45:25.155 --> 02:45:26.236]  Absolutely.
[02:45:26.857 --> 02:45:34.924]  And all that I have said is, and I think you as well, is I'm not afraid of anything.
[02:45:35.804 --> 02:45:39.207]  Paul Joseph Watson, what do you wish you didn't know?
[02:45:40.308 --> 02:45:40.949]  What truth
[02:45:41.815 --> 02:45:43.636]  Do you wish you didn't know?
[02:45:43.856 --> 02:45:46.098]  What are you sorry for knowing?
[02:45:46.718 --> 02:45:49.260]  What information do you wish you were dumb about?
[02:45:49.280 --> 02:45:51.721]  Because I haven't figured it out yet.
[02:45:52.442 --> 02:45:54.383]  I have not found anything where I said, boy, you know what?
[02:45:54.903 --> 02:45:57.145]  I wish I didn't know that historical fact.
[02:45:57.805 --> 02:46:00.046]  I wish I didn't know that cancer scare.
[02:46:00.427 --> 02:46:04.469]  I wish I didn't know the truth about this war that I thought was noble.
[02:46:05.290 --> 02:46:06.430]  Ignorance is not bliss.
[02:46:06.650 --> 02:46:07.311]  It's dangerous.
[02:46:08.103 --> 02:46:10.684]  And I never apologize to anybody for wanting to know the truth.
[02:46:11.265 --> 02:46:12.185]  I ask questions.
[02:46:12.545 --> 02:46:13.466]  You've seen kids.
[02:46:13.766 --> 02:46:14.667]  What do kids always ask?
[02:46:14.907 --> 02:46:15.227]  Why?
[02:46:16.548 --> 02:46:16.948]  Go to work.
[02:46:17.128 --> 02:46:17.368]  Why?
[02:46:17.628 --> 02:46:18.028]  Go to bed.
[02:46:18.168 --> 02:46:18.429]  Why?
[02:46:18.849 --> 02:46:19.469]  You need your sleep.
[02:46:19.609 --> 02:46:19.889]  Why?
[02:46:19.909 --> 02:46:21.370]  I'm not being pesky.
[02:46:21.510 --> 02:46:22.311]  It's a beautiful question.
[02:46:22.471 --> 02:46:22.871]  Why?
[02:46:22.891 --> 02:46:24.232]  I don't understand this.
[02:46:24.572 --> 02:46:25.492]  I'm not satisfied.
[02:46:25.772 --> 02:46:26.833]  Give me an example if I could.
[02:46:27.493 --> 02:46:35.718]  Did you happen to see Norah O'Donnell speak recently on CBS with Prince Turki al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia?
[02:46:37.526 --> 02:46:38.487]  Regarding ISIS?
[02:46:39.188 --> 02:46:41.770]  Yeah, we played that clip on the Sunday Show, I believe.
[02:46:43.912 --> 02:46:44.873]  Now, wait a minute!
[02:46:45.374 --> 02:46:45.734]  Stop!
[02:46:45.754 --> 02:46:49.718]  This is where I imagine this scene, like a Kubrick movie.
[02:46:50.099 --> 02:46:52.801]  Somebody walks off in the set, wearing a headset.
[02:46:53.622 --> 02:46:57.706]  He's a stagehand, or somebody, and he says, stop, stop, stop!
[02:46:58.147 --> 02:46:59.908]  I can't take this anymore!
[02:47:00.936 --> 02:47:04.300]  Ask him about how many people they've beheaded!
[02:47:04.961 --> 02:47:08.625]  They beheaded a woman recently for sorcery!
[02:47:09.186 --> 02:47:10.387]  Did you know that?
[02:47:11.148 --> 02:47:20.158]  You're asking a man who lives in a country, who rules basically over a country, that beheads women for sorcery!
[02:47:20.905 --> 02:47:23.767]  Now let me just let that marinate a little bit.
[02:47:24.488 --> 02:47:40.940]  Ask him about his brother, Abd al-Rahman al-Faisal, who's the paymaster for ISIS, or ISIL, or IS, or AQI, or al-Nusra Front, or Al-Qaeda, or Daesh, or whatever neologism you want to give it.
[02:47:41.661 --> 02:47:42.681]  And Khorasan.
[02:47:43.102 --> 02:47:45.103]  You know how many people, did you know this?
[02:47:45.403 --> 02:47:47.725]  How many Khorasan members there are, Paul Joseph Watson?
[02:47:48.246 --> 02:47:48.566]  Fifty.
[02:47:50.137 --> 02:47:51.959]  And this was a group that they just invented.
[02:47:52.199 --> 02:48:00.928]  I mean, it's basically al-Nusra, who they were supporting previously, because all the Syrian rebels, the so-called Syrian rebels, defected to al-Nusra.
[02:48:01.469 --> 02:48:08.116]  So they just re-named the group to hide the fact that they had indirectly supported the group before this so-called bombing.
[02:48:08.156 --> 02:48:08.677]  It's amazing.
[02:48:09.057 --> 02:48:10.679]  Now, quick call Judy in Florida.
[02:48:10.899 --> 02:48:11.500]  Go ahead, Judy.
[02:48:12.904 --> 02:48:15.185]  Hi Paul, this is really great to speak with you.
[02:48:15.466 --> 02:48:19.228]  I've talked to other hosts on Alex's program.
[02:48:19.268 --> 02:48:22.670]  I guess I've called almost as much as McGruff at this point.
[02:48:23.730 --> 02:48:27.993]  But I had a story I wanted to tell you very, very quickly and then I had my question.
[02:48:28.213 --> 02:48:35.197]  But I sent out an email when I found out about the first Ebola case and I sent out to my network
[02:48:37.108 --> 02:48:45.671]  And essentially, you know, discussed what I felt was the gravity of the situation and said, this is not fear mongering, but this is something everybody needs to be aware of, blah, blah, blah.
[02:48:46.291 --> 02:48:52.174]  And I brought up the point that the plane had touched down with patient zero at Dulles International.
[02:48:52.554 --> 02:48:56.915]  The reason why that's significant is because I used to live very close to it.
[02:48:57.255 --> 02:49:03.858]  And I got an email back from a very close friend's son.
[02:49:04.603 --> 02:49:19.194]  And he said, in a very contrite, very condescending way, Ebola is not transferable during incubation, it can only be transmitted with direct contact with feces, saliva, and blood, and that's when most severe symptoms have set in.
[02:49:19.995 --> 02:49:29.862]  And, you know, I said, well, you know, it's also potentially airborne, I said in an email back to him, and I sent yours and Dew's report that had the
[02:49:30.732 --> 02:49:36.234]  Uh, video of that facility that held the monkeys on the quarantine unit in Reston, Virginia.
[02:49:37.314 --> 02:49:41.076]  And, uh, you know, to, you know, further validate what I was trying to say.
[02:49:41.116 --> 02:49:50.939]  And the thing is, the skating rink and the statue in Reston is, you know, I used to work right down the street from it, and I used to live in Reston, Virginia.
[02:49:51.659 --> 02:49:53.580]  And this guy still lives in Reston, Virginia.
[02:49:53.620 --> 02:49:54.080]  But, you know,
[02:49:54.770 --> 02:50:19.117]  I think he was, he's, he's pooh-pahs a lot of what I have to say, but I think, I guess what I'm trying to get to is that I'm really kind of tired of being, you know, talked to in a condescending way by anyone, because what we are, what I see you and Alex and anybody's got, you know, any want to know the truth, that we're the intellectuals, we're the ones that are the shepherds.
[02:50:19.197 --> 02:50:23.938]  We are shepherding those, we're trying to save the lives of those that are
[02:50:24.557 --> 02:50:27.136]  You know, right now condemning us that are, you know...
[02:50:28.302 --> 02:50:33.266]  Not the government, that's actually, or the New World Order cabal.
[02:50:33.586 --> 02:50:35.508]  That's, yeah, that's why we're taking so much flak.
[02:50:35.528 --> 02:50:39.170]  That's why, you know, trust in media is now back to its record low.
[02:50:39.210 --> 02:50:42.413]  I mean, people are seeing right through that, and they're seeing right through the attacks.
[02:50:42.473 --> 02:50:44.314]  So, I mean, that's definitely the case.
[02:50:44.534 --> 02:50:48.137]  We're going to be back in the next segment, final segment, with Lionel.
[02:50:48.157 --> 02:50:51.239]  We're going to talk about media narratives and how we can shape them.
[02:50:51.740 --> 02:50:55.903]  LionelMedia.com is the website, or at LionelMedia on Twitter.
[02:50:56.463 --> 02:51:02.513]  This is the Alex Jones Show live breaking news as it happens at InfoWars.com.
[02:51:02.693 --> 02:51:03.334]  Stay right there.
[02:51:03.394 --> 02:51:05.738]  We'll be back with Lionel after the break.
[02:51:10.214 --> 02:51:13.116]  The Feds are trying to ban your right to own body armor.
[02:51:13.316 --> 02:51:19.000]  It is crucial to purchase your body armor before it is too late and another one of your rights are taken away.
[02:51:19.020 --> 02:51:23.464]  KD Armor has the most affordable level 3 armor on the market today.
[02:51:23.704 --> 02:51:27.066]  KD Armor withstands up to 7.62 NATO rounds.
[02:51:27.406 --> 02:51:29.248]  Don't have your own body armor yet?
[02:51:29.368 --> 02:51:30.989]  Hurry before it's too late.
[02:51:31.249 --> 02:51:33.471]  Order yours at KDArmor.com.
[02:51:33.751 --> 02:51:36.193]  That's K-A-T-I-Armor.com.
[02:51:36.553 --> 02:51:37.574]  Come and take it.
[02:51:38.114 --> 02:51:38.855]  Get some!
[02:51:39.619 --> 02:51:48.881]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:51:48.921 --> 02:51:49.661]  This capitalism?
[02:51:49.721 --> 02:51:55.842]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:51:55.882 --> 02:51:59.522]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[02:51:59.582 --> 02:52:00.503]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:52:00.523 --> 02:52:01.863]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:52:01.903 --> 02:52:02.203]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:52:02.243 --> 02:52:02.503]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:52:09.304 --> 02:52:12.947]  We all have our own idea about what being safe and secure means.
[02:52:13.287 --> 02:52:18.532]  The doors lock, bills are paid, you've got a job that keeps the lights on, and a home to call your own.
[02:52:18.792 --> 02:52:21.194]  But what happens when Mother Nature throws a curveball?
[02:52:24.005 --> 02:52:27.926]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time?
[02:52:28.286 --> 02:52:29.747]  Do you even have a plan B?
[02:52:30.387 --> 02:52:33.388]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[02:52:33.688 --> 02:52:34.888]  Children left with no homes.
[02:52:34.928 --> 02:52:36.269]  And no one's coming to help them.
[02:52:36.749 --> 02:52:39.590]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster.
[02:52:39.810 --> 02:52:40.070]  I think so.
[02:53:08.934 --> 02:53:17.404]  You've heard about the essential qualities of iodine when it comes to your well-being, and you've read the opinions of top experts regarding this good member of the halogen family.
[02:53:17.584 --> 02:53:23.812]  Still, reports indicate that iodine is absent in sufficient amounts from the daily lives of countless people worldwide.
[02:53:24.172 --> 02:53:27.855]  Now, our extra strength new nascent iodine formula is here.
[02:53:28.095 --> 02:53:29.456]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:53:29.477 --> 02:53:33.760]  Leading the way into the next generation of super high quality nascent iodine.
[02:53:33.900 --> 02:53:39.265]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield X2 is derived from 200 plus million year old salt solutions.
[02:53:39.485 --> 02:53:42.166]  Found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[02:53:42.546 --> 02:53:50.528]  The result is a unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives, genetically modified ingredients, and completely vegan.
[02:53:50.648 --> 02:53:54.109]  We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X2 Iodine for radiation.
[02:53:54.309 --> 02:53:57.130]  Pure, clean, and sourced from deep within the Earth.
[02:53:57.450 --> 02:54:03.652]  X2 Nascent Iodine is available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:54:27.964 --> 02:54:30.706]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show with Lionel.
[02:54:30.806 --> 02:54:33.367]  There's an update coming from Dallas health officials.
[02:54:33.407 --> 02:54:39.030]  They're about to give a press conference here in the next 20 minutes or so about the Ebola situation.
[02:54:39.310 --> 02:54:52.437]  Obviously 100 people exposed at least in Dallas so hopefully there are no more confirmed cases but there is about to be another update on that situation in Dallas so we'll be tracking that of course across the website.
[02:54:52.498 --> 02:54:54.899]  We're currently talking to Lionel of LionelMedia.com
[02:54:55.399 --> 02:55:00.201]  Lionel, just in the last few minutes I wanted to get into this recent Gallup poll.
[02:55:00.261 --> 02:55:04.622]  Trust in mainstream media returns to its previous all-time low of 40%.
[02:55:05.202 --> 02:55:08.143]  And again, it goes back to this David Cameron UN speech.
[02:55:08.183 --> 02:55:12.505]  They're petrified of losing their ability to control the narrative.
[02:55:12.825 --> 02:55:24.789]  They still have to act in concert to do so, the mainstream media, because they're losing their individual power, their audience, so long as they can corral everybody around a talking point or around a narrative.
[02:55:25.109 --> 02:55:33.312]  They're still able to sway huge numbers of the US population, but obviously their power in terms of that is diluting.
[02:55:33.632 --> 02:55:42.015]  You know, we had Drudge 15 years ago go in front of the National Press Club and basically say that the media landscape is about to completely change.
[02:55:42.055 --> 02:55:43.636]  He was dead on accurate.
[02:55:43.696 --> 02:55:45.096]  That happened over the next 15 years.
[02:55:46.957 --> 02:55:55.826]  Given that they're so insecure now, apparently, about losing the ability to control this narrative, how do you see the media landscape developing over the next 15 years?
[02:55:57.568 --> 02:55:58.409]  Developing?
[02:55:59.850 --> 02:56:01.011]  Degenerating, maybe.
[02:56:01.031 --> 02:56:02.293]  Degenerating, perhaps?
[02:56:02.613 --> 02:56:03.414]  Pock-filled?
[02:56:03.814 --> 02:56:08.579]  Not only that, conventional talk radio, you name it.
[02:56:08.739 --> 02:56:10.041]  You know, just to give you an idea,
[02:56:11.368 --> 02:56:27.895]  First and foremost, I think if Alex, if I knew, if I know Alex like I think I know Alex, if you were to be at a press conference, and somebody were to turn to you and say yes, and you basically ask the question, is it okay?
[02:56:29.415 --> 02:56:29.695]  That's it.
[02:56:30.316 --> 02:56:38.219]  Because believe it or not, in certain mainstream media, and I kid you not, I can say that on a family show,
[02:56:39.144 --> 02:56:41.086]  They send somebody out to a report.
[02:56:41.406 --> 02:56:43.788]  We'll say, kid, all right, Watson, you're new here.
[02:56:44.509 --> 02:56:49.893]  We'll give you $25 or a six-pack if you can get the mic flag in the press conference.
[02:56:49.933 --> 02:56:58.100]  A little card, a little square that fits on the microphone showing the television or radio stations call letters.
[02:56:58.881 --> 02:57:02.524]  If you can get that mic flag in, $25 and a six-pack.
[02:57:02.744 --> 02:57:03.425]  You think I'm kidding?
[02:57:04.145 --> 02:57:08.006]  You don't have to know anything to be in mainstream media.
[02:57:08.346 --> 02:57:14.067]  You got to look like Barbie or Ken or be cute and that's it.
[02:57:14.107 --> 02:57:20.189]  I mean, nobody will ever call you and say, Watson, what the hell do you know about?
[02:57:20.549 --> 02:57:21.829]  No, I don't need to know anything.
[02:57:22.129 --> 02:57:29.791]  The other day when Rick Perry was talking, I think with Sean Hannity, Rick Perry said, oh, there's nothing to worry about.
[02:57:30.934 --> 02:57:33.215]  Imagine this thought experiment, Paul.
[02:57:33.556 --> 02:57:35.937]  What if somebody said, hey Rick, did you hear the news?
[02:57:36.237 --> 02:57:38.058]  Let's just assume we're at a press conference.
[02:57:38.658 --> 02:57:41.680]  They just found out that there is a vaccine for Ebola.
[02:57:41.900 --> 02:57:43.121]  It's called Gardasil.
[02:57:44.554 --> 02:57:46.336]  I mean, he would be all over that.
[02:57:46.396 --> 02:57:46.836]  Really?
[02:57:46.856 --> 02:57:49.259]  I still have that Merck deal going.
[02:57:49.459 --> 02:57:59.209]  This is a guy who basically, talking about vaccines, if I were to meet with a pool of, let's say, Texas media people and say, you know about Perry, right?
[02:57:59.269 --> 02:58:00.030]  And Gardasil?
[02:58:00.230 --> 02:58:00.430]  No.
[02:58:00.910 --> 02:58:01.371]  HPV?
[02:58:01.571 --> 02:58:01.791]  Merck?
[02:58:01.831 --> 02:58:02.032]  No.
[02:58:02.752 --> 02:58:03.853]  You don't know anything about that?
[02:58:03.873 --> 02:58:03.913]  No.
[02:58:04.694 --> 02:58:05.075]  Okay.
[02:58:05.375 --> 02:58:05.655]  Wow.
[02:58:06.937 --> 02:58:10.404]  If you ask these people, what do you know about?
[02:58:11.486 --> 02:58:13.550]  What is your frame of reference?
[02:58:13.871 --> 02:58:15.013]  Tell me what you know about Ebola.
[02:58:15.214 --> 02:58:17.097]  Listen, Paul, I gotta be honest.
[02:58:18.238 --> 02:58:20.820]  And I love when people always preface what they're saying with, I gotta be honest.
[02:58:20.880 --> 02:58:22.821]  Like, well thanks for letting me know this.
[02:58:23.462 --> 02:58:25.183]  But this is about a plague.
[02:58:25.663 --> 02:58:26.404]  A pandemic.
[02:58:26.904 --> 02:58:28.685]  I have to ask for permission for this?
[02:58:29.085 --> 02:58:29.286]  Seriously?
[02:58:29.306 --> 02:58:29.686]  That's right.
[02:58:29.846 --> 02:58:30.526]  It's amazing.
[02:58:30.927 --> 02:58:32.668]  Lionel, we're wrapping up the show now.

[02:59:19.820 --> 02:59:21.241]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[02:59:21.361 --> 02:59:24.162]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:59:24.222 --> 02:59:27.284]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:59:27.464 --> 02:59:29.646]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:59:29.946 --> 02:59:31.267]  People are assaulting us!
[02:59:31.287 --> 02:59:33.629]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:59:34.109 --> 02:59:35.771]  They are never going to stop.
[02:59:36.051 --> 02:59:39.974]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
