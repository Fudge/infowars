[00:00:03.504 --> 00:00:04.125]  Big Brother.
[00:00:04.805 --> 00:00:05.846]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:06.567 --> 00:00:07.668]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:08.328 --> 00:00:09.149]  You want answers?
[00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:10.830]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:11.471 --> 00:00:15.134]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:15.655 --> 00:00:19.758]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:32.029]  Two months ago, callers to my radio show and emailers said, Alex, start a national coffee party to wake up the tea parties that neocons are taking it over.
[00:00:33.496 --> 00:00:34.937]  And we bought the website names.
[00:00:36.118 --> 00:00:36.818]  I didn't build it.
[00:00:36.878 --> 00:00:42.141]  I meant to just put up a code of what a real Tea Party person, from my view, should support.
[00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:46.684]  Cutting taxes, smaller government, controlling our borders, not launching all these new wars.
[00:00:47.224 --> 00:00:49.926]  You know, that the Oath Keepers are good, Sheriff Mac is good.
[00:00:50.526 --> 00:00:54.248]  Because now the Republican Party's coming out demonizing Sheriff Mac.
[00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:56.129]  And saying, oh, these are extremists.
[00:00:56.169 --> 00:01:00.252]  Saying sheriffs need to, you know, run their county and that the states need to get control.
[00:01:01.482 --> 00:01:05.185]  Well now the Democrats have been caught setting up a coffee party.
[00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:07.087]  No doubt trying to preempt us.
[00:01:07.608 --> 00:01:12.652]  So we're going to crack the whip around here and get this up and get this rolling in the next few days.
[00:01:13.293 --> 00:01:14.975]  I'm going to cover more of that coming up.
[00:01:15.916 --> 00:01:17.197]  We got Ron Paul in one hour.
[00:01:18.343 --> 00:01:30.455]  We'll talk about a host of important issues with the Congressman, but for the next 30 minutes, we're joined by Larry Pratt, Executive Director of the only real national, no-compromise, Second Amendment lobby, Gun Owners of America.
[00:01:31.135 --> 00:01:40.124]  And I've got him on about a host of issues, but every few months he comes on to break down the latest attack strategies by the victim disarmament parasites in government.
[00:01:41.355 --> 00:01:46.480]  And the DC Heller case said, yeah, you've got an individual right, but we have a right to restrict it.
[00:01:46.841 --> 00:01:48.643]  So it was really in a way bad.
[00:01:50.585 --> 00:02:01.716]  In new statements, they haven't ruled yet, but they made statements during the deliberations that, oh yeah, Chicago and New York and DC can't completely not let you have guns, but we do
[00:02:04.622 --> 00:02:06.264]  Basically, you have a right to turn your guns in.
[00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:11.271]  Yes, you have a Second Amendment, but we have a right to ban your guns if we want, which is totally asinine.
[00:02:11.672 --> 00:02:13.434]  So, joining us is Larry Pratt.
[00:02:14.376 --> 00:02:18.762]  Larry, I've seen some of the gun-grabbing groups are saying they're actually happy about where the court's going.
[00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.749]  Couple reasons.
[00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:30.131]  I think one is that they're hoping that the standard that the court will use in determining that the Chicago handgun ban is unconstitutional.
[00:02:30.471 --> 00:02:32.231]  And most people think they will do that.
[00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:45.494]  But the standard that they are very possibly going to use would mean that you could start heading off into the wild blue yonder and making housing a right or health a right.
[00:02:46.114 --> 00:02:49.695]  And of course, that would be the end of freedom in this country, as we know it.
[00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:54.940]  And this is something that has been developing over time.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.001]  This wouldn't be new with this case.
[00:02:57.661 --> 00:03:02.202]  The judges have been taking power into their hands for a long time.
[00:03:02.242 --> 00:03:05.363]  That's not a news flash, certainly not to you and your listeners.
[00:03:05.803 --> 00:03:11.764]  But the fact is, they may continue in that direction.
[00:03:12.564 --> 00:03:17.065]  And that is going to mean more gun control would be possible.
[00:03:17.105 --> 00:03:19.786]  They'll decide on a case-by-case basis.
[00:03:20.606 --> 00:03:23.048]  Scalia's opinion in the D.C.
[00:03:23.068 --> 00:03:28.731]  handgun case made it sound like he didn't have any problem if government wanted to outlaw machine guns.
[00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:38.517]  Well, excuse me, but if there is a militia weapon of our day, the quintessential militia weapon, that's it!
[00:03:39.478 --> 00:03:43.861]  That's the one that the Swiss send home with every one of their citizen army.
[00:03:44.901 --> 00:03:47.243]  And here in this country we think somehow
[00:03:48.115 --> 00:03:50.796]  Only the government should have the militia weapon?
[00:03:51.457 --> 00:03:51.757]  Woof!
[00:03:52.277 --> 00:03:59.461]  That's the kind of militia they have in Cuba, in Venezuela, had in the Soviet Union, and so forth.
[00:04:01.142 --> 00:04:04.383]  It's going to be nice that you'll be able to have a handgun in Chicago.
[00:04:04.423 --> 00:04:06.104]  That's a likely outcome.
[00:04:06.304 --> 00:04:08.425]  Probably at least five votes in favor of that.
[00:04:08.685 --> 00:04:09.446]  Maybe even six.
[00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:16.810]  Then we're going to have to continue watching what Mr. Heller, who got the D.C.
[00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:17.750]  gun ban overturned
[00:04:18.388 --> 00:04:18.909]  Absolutely.
[00:04:36.144 --> 00:04:43.592]  Unless you make a $30,000 donation to the sheriff in New York, you're not going to get one, so only rich Goldman Sachs billionaires have it.
[00:04:43.612 --> 00:04:44.412]  That was in Bloomberg.
[00:04:44.673 --> 00:04:45.974]  They're arming against the public.
[00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:48.957]  The bankers have all got semi-autos, whatever they want.
[00:04:49.257 --> 00:04:56.224]  The public's being mugged in the street by the hordes of vampiric homeless people running around in the drug-crazed stupors.
[00:04:56.264 --> 00:04:56.625]  Stay there.
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.684]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:05:03.704 --> 00:05:07.047]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:05:07.287 --> 00:05:12.052]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:05:12.072 --> 00:05:18.338]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:05:18.478 --> 00:05:20.721]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:05:21.241 --> 00:05:21.521]  Tim Geithner?
[00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:21.981]  Bernanke?
[00:05:22.062 --> 00:05:22.662]  They're arsonists!
[00:05:22.742 --> 00:05:24.003]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:26.264]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:05:40.151 --> 00:05:41.992]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:05:42.292 --> 00:05:47.095]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:05:47.435 --> 00:05:56.540]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:00.489 --> 00:06:04.130]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:12.593]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:06:13.313 --> 00:06:17.354]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:06:17.934 --> 00:06:28.758]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:06:29.398 --> 00:06:38.400]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.941]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:06:44.342 --> 00:06:51.523]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:06:51.823 --> 00:06:54.564]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:06:58.356 --> 00:07:02.598]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:02.918 --> 00:07:03.519]  Number one.
[00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:06.981]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:07.241 --> 00:07:07.821]  Number two.
[00:07:08.101 --> 00:07:12.664]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:13.004 --> 00:07:13.464]  It's true.
[00:07:13.744 --> 00:07:18.287]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:18.607 --> 00:07:19.148]  Number 3.
[00:07:19.428 --> 00:07:22.711]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:23.011 --> 00:07:26.754]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:26.935 --> 00:07:27.495]  Number 4.
[00:07:27.735 --> 00:07:30.097]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:30.498 --> 00:07:33.881]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:34.181 --> 00:07:34.381]  Number 5.
[00:07:34.962 --> 00:07:38.885]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:39.106 --> 00:07:43.870]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:48.192]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:48.312 --> 00:07:49.872]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:50.113 --> 00:07:52.193]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:07:52.354 --> 00:07:54.955]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:54.975 --> 00:08:05.039]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.134 --> 00:08:11.576]  By the way, we are simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv, the second, third, and fourth hour.
[00:08:11.596 --> 00:08:13.337]  Ron Paul coming up in the next hour.
[00:08:14.457 --> 00:08:18.839]  Going back to Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:32.826]  If you just joined us, the Supreme Court, a year and a half ago, ruled that the Second Amendment is an individual right, as if we needed them to tell us this, but they had language in there about, but there can be reasonable restraints on it.
[00:08:34.286 --> 00:09:02.754]  And now they're saying, well, people have this right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness, and claiming this federal power over the states, whereas where I look at it, it should be the state's decision through their state constitutions, but when that does violate the Bill of Rights, then the federal government and the Supreme Court does kick in, and Larry Pratt's an expert on this, so navigate this for us, Larry Pratt, and explain why are the gun-grabbing groups saying that they're somewhat happy
[00:09:03.354 --> 00:09:09.135]  Well, there's nothing in this suit coming out of Chicago that is going to jeopardize the licensing schemes of any of these local jurisdictions.
[00:09:25.194 --> 00:09:30.836]  And so, yes, the gun ban will be gone, but then the next challenge is going to be, oh, so you want a gun?
[00:09:31.536 --> 00:09:33.377]  Whatever made you think that would be easy?
[00:09:34.697 --> 00:09:38.278]  And, you know, there was a reporter after the D.C.
[00:09:38.878 --> 00:09:50.042]  gun ban fell, went through the process, took him six or seven months, $750 in fees and lessons that he had to take and all this kind of nonsense.
[00:09:50.926 --> 00:09:52.987]  And finally got his gun.
[00:09:53.207 --> 00:09:57.410]  But it was something that, as a matter of his job, he was able to do.
[00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:07.755]  But most of us who have a 9 to 5, and the bureaucrats probably work 9.30 to 4.30, rots of ruck getting over there and getting the papers.
[00:10:07.775 --> 00:10:13.959]  You know, you have to take vacation time on top of everything else to try to go through this gauntlet.
[00:10:14.499 --> 00:10:15.599]  And that's the way they like it.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.202]  And they make the fees high enough that it becomes prohibitive, as they do in New York.
[00:10:21.129 --> 00:10:27.051]  It makes it so complicated, you may need an attorney to navigate through the system.
[00:10:27.071 --> 00:10:33.652]  So the language is, again, okay, you do have a right, but we have a right to make it almost impossible to get one.
[00:10:33.972 --> 00:10:37.253]  So far, that's about all that we've accomplished.
[00:10:37.913 --> 00:10:39.114]  And, you know, it's progress.
[00:10:39.734 --> 00:10:41.454]  No more gun bans in D.C.
[00:10:41.634 --> 00:10:43.875]  No more, probably, in Chicago.
[00:10:44.535 --> 00:10:48.537]  A lot's going to hang on what Mr. Heller is doing.
[00:10:48.697 --> 00:10:56.121]  If he has a favorable outcome, then he's going to be junking the licensing scheme in the district.
[00:10:56.401 --> 00:11:12.269]  He's got another attorney, because the one that went up on his case the first time actually agreed with Justice Stevens that there is such a thing as reasonable infringement, which would include licensing.
[00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.052]  And well, that was the ballgame.
[00:11:15.412 --> 00:11:24.019]  And even Scalia said, you know, we're not going to rule on the District of Columbia's licensing law because that was taken off the table by counsel.
[00:11:24.679 --> 00:11:31.564]  So that that was a very expensive decision that that attorney made.
[00:11:31.624 --> 00:11:35.147]  And actually, from what he said later, that's what he believes.
[00:11:35.207 --> 00:11:36.248]  He doesn't have a problem
[00:11:37.743 --> 00:12:01.025]  And going back from memory, correct me if I'm wrong, the NRA came in and stuck their snout in the middle of the suit and was allowed to file briefs, and they were arguing in their filing that, yeah, you're allowed to make us get licenses and make it hard to get, we're just saying that if you can jump through a hundred flaming hoops and climb Mount Everest and
[00:12:01.906 --> 00:12:07.088]  If pigs can fly, then maybe sometime on a blue moon you can look at a gun.
[00:12:07.748 --> 00:12:12.430]  They basically agreed that yes, you can restrict, but there is sometimes a right.
[00:12:13.291 --> 00:12:23.935]  The NRA for a long time has taken a position that these kinds of, to use Stevens' term, reasonable infringements are acceptable.
[00:12:24.715 --> 00:12:28.357]  They were the ones who wrote the instant background check law.
[00:12:29.724 --> 00:12:32.827]  That was not something that the Brady's came up with.
[00:12:32.847 --> 00:12:35.870]  The NRA spearheaded the 1968 Gun Control Act.
[00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:38.972]  It was when the Brady Law was before Congress.
[00:12:39.012 --> 00:12:40.714]  It was originally a waiting period.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:49.904]  And had it remained just that, Sheriff Mack's lawsuit would have overturned that and we would have had Zippo in this area.
[00:12:49.924 --> 00:12:52.686]  But instead they moved to an instant registration, again.
[00:12:53.006 --> 00:12:53.486]  Exactly.
[00:12:53.766 --> 00:12:58.909]  And that supplanted the waiting period after, I don't remember, four or five years.
[00:12:59.549 --> 00:13:01.290]  And that's what we're stuck with now.
[00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:09.134]  So they think inside a very small box and they're afraid to push
[00:13:09.594 --> 00:13:09.754]  Yes.
[00:13:28.835 --> 00:13:31.516]  And it's kind of fun spending all this money anyway.
[00:13:32.557 --> 00:13:35.838]  So that's the business-as-usual attitude that we're up against.
[00:13:36.178 --> 00:13:36.879]  And it's killing us.
[00:13:37.299 --> 00:13:37.739]  It's killing us.
[00:13:37.759 --> 00:13:41.321]  Larry Pratt, Executive Director, Gun Owners of America, GunOwners.org.
[00:13:41.341 --> 00:13:44.142]  We've got it up on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:13:44.202 --> 00:13:50.425]  Links to it up on InfoWars.com for radio listeners who want to go visit the sites and find out more and sign up for your great free alerts.
[00:13:51.065 --> 00:13:52.426]  Let's get into some other areas.
[00:13:53.306 --> 00:13:54.727]  I look at national statistics.
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:04.189]  Roughly 50-50, 25 years ago, in polls, half the public was ignorant and said, oh yes, let's restrict guns.
[00:14:04.589 --> 00:14:10.535]  Now I see national polls of over 70% and growing every year say, get rid of all the gun laws.
[00:14:10.896 --> 00:14:13.258]  It only empowers criminals and a corrupt government.
[00:14:13.538 --> 00:14:15.060]  We're seeing record gun sales.
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.542]  We're seeing a lot of so-called liberals buying guns.
[00:14:18.183 --> 00:14:24.909]  And we're also seeing Airsoft, which shoots a plastic safe BB, selling like hotcakes everywhere.
[00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:30.875]  I mean, they've got double aisles at Walmart and double aisles at Academy here in Austin, where I live.
[00:14:31.135 --> 00:14:35.700]  Every time I'm there, people are just all over the Airsoft aisle, snatching and grabbing.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.601]  You know, I've bought a bunch of these.
[00:14:38.142 --> 00:14:40.064]  It's great marksmanship for your children.
[00:14:40.104 --> 00:14:41.725]  It's air-powered, very safe.
[00:14:42.626 --> 00:14:48.890]  It's a gateway for people into firearms who would be scared to even pick up a BB gun or then a real firearm.
[00:14:49.331 --> 00:14:54.154]  Studies show it's causing people to relearn to not be so scared of guns.
[00:14:54.674 --> 00:14:59.398]  And so now, all over Europe, all over England, Australia, Canada, they're banning them.
[00:14:59.938 --> 00:15:02.400]  And you know about the case in Cornelius, Oregon.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.981]  We had the fellow on two days ago.
[00:15:04.241 --> 00:15:04.501]  Right.
[00:15:04.561 --> 00:15:07.762]  They seized $30,000, now they've seized $20,000 more.
[00:15:08.142 --> 00:15:08.962]  Totally legal.
[00:15:09.122 --> 00:15:09.702]  Replica.
[00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:10.462]  They look real.
[00:15:10.862 --> 00:15:13.943]  And the ATF agent says on TV, it looks scary.
[00:15:14.543 --> 00:15:16.184]  I'm not going to allow you to have this.
[00:15:16.944 --> 00:15:22.625]  And he even got the ATF importation office to talk to them and tell them, you don't have authority.
[00:15:23.265 --> 00:15:25.226]  And the Oregon office said, we don't care.
[00:15:25.346 --> 00:15:26.746]  Obama's giving us backing.
[00:15:27.146 --> 00:15:28.206]  That's the key.
[00:15:28.806 --> 00:15:30.827]  I knew this was coming from the top.
[00:15:31.287 --> 00:15:38.269]  As long as President Hussein is in office, we are going to see this kind of lawlessness.
[00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:46.531]  If a bureaucrat wants to do this kind of thing, he knows he will not be held accountable by the guy at the top.
[00:15:46.891 --> 00:15:49.192]  And so we're going to see more of this, I'm afraid.
[00:15:49.512 --> 00:15:52.273]  Well, they're claiming that they have a ruling power.
[00:15:52.613 --> 00:15:57.194]  Same way they can say a semi-auto is really full-auto, now toy guns, Larry?
[00:15:58.374 --> 00:16:00.955]  I mean, aren't they wide open to serious lawsuits?
[00:16:00.975 --> 00:16:02.496]  But also, isn't it criminal?
[00:16:03.176 --> 00:16:04.137]  No paperwork either.
[00:16:04.157 --> 00:16:10.859]  They've grabbed two shipments, $50,000 worth, and just say, we're not talking to you, we're not giving you the paperwork, it's over.
[00:16:10.919 --> 00:16:12.200]  I mean, this is lawlessness.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:17.462]  It's about as outrageous a behavior as we've seen perhaps since Waco.
[00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:30.079]  Uh, these guys, uh, are so clearly thinking that they're above the law, they don't have to answer the phone, they don't, uh, they've told the company that they don't have any obligation to
[00:16:31.174 --> 00:16:39.616]  Even talk to them or explain how the company could make right, quote unquote, whatever it is that the government... Well, what should Brad Martin do then?
[00:16:39.636 --> 00:16:43.638]  I mean, this is the same as highway bandits robbing a stagecoach at this point.
[00:16:43.978 --> 00:16:49.519]  Well, I talked to our federal affairs guys and I said, look, there's a couple things that I'd like to see us try to do.
[00:16:49.999 --> 00:17:00.182]  Let's get the heads of the Second Amendment caucuses in the Congress, in the House and the Senate, to write some letters asking for an explanation.
[00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:02.131]  Probably get stonewalled.
[00:17:02.251 --> 00:17:17.278]  Okay, then let's start looking for ways to put some zeros in the customs budget, because the customs actually was the doofus that got this thing started, and the ATF seems to be running cover for them, happily.
[00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:24.581]  So we can go in there and just zero out their enforcement offices in those particular cities.
[00:17:24.982 --> 00:17:26.322]  And then those guys are out of a job.
[00:17:26.462 --> 00:17:29.564]  I don't think they'll be volunteering to go to work.
[00:17:31.218 --> 00:17:47.026]  I mean, what's going on where the ATF comes into Austin, it's now been confirmed, and just ordered the Austin police chief shut down this legal gun show, and they did it, by going to the landlord, to the owner, and just saying, we're going to charge you, or use nuisance abatement crack house laws on you.
[00:17:47.846 --> 00:18:00.372]  And that would have been a frivolous lawsuit, but I can just see how the corporate attorney is thinking, my job is to save my employer, my client, hassle and money.
[00:18:00.751 --> 00:18:05.898]  And it's going to be a lot cheaper for him to lose this contract than it is to pay me to fight these jerks off.
[00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:10.103]  But isn't that the essence of racketeering and government color of law tyranny?
[00:18:10.364 --> 00:18:14.069]  Hitler didn't have a law to lock up Jewish businesses, he just did it!
[00:18:14.656 --> 00:18:24.279]  Well, you and I see that very clearly, and again, it's the lawlessness that we've come to expect from an administration that itself is lawless.
[00:18:24.639 --> 00:18:37.823]  Their answer, I can just hear the President now, if we were in that Blair House on another meeting, talking about things like this, the most likely answer I would expect is a stony, I won.
[00:18:40.714 --> 00:18:42.677]  In other words, I can do anything I want because I won.
[00:18:43.378 --> 00:18:44.739]  There are no laws that govern me.
[00:18:46.081 --> 00:18:51.429]  That's where we are in this country and there are a lot of people that actually think that way too.
[00:18:51.689 --> 00:18:54.633]  Hey, he got elected, now we can do anything we want.
[00:18:55.448 --> 00:19:02.154]  So the idea that we're in a republic where a lot of things are going to be almost always off-bounds, off-limits.
[00:19:03.615 --> 00:19:08.019]  We've got at least two generations that hasn't been taught that in their government schools.
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.763]  Well, Larry Brandt, how dangerous of a precedent is it?
[00:19:12.343 --> 00:19:14.525]  They know there's not a lobby for toy guns.
[00:19:15.326 --> 00:19:18.128]  They're using the ATF that is a supposed
[00:19:20.453 --> 00:19:27.516]  Second Amendment regulating organization to outside their jurisdiction go after this as a direct attack on the Second Amendment.
[00:19:27.836 --> 00:19:30.417]  I mean clearly we've got to stand up and fight this.
[00:19:30.737 --> 00:19:38.161]  We do and I think that we have the soldiers in the Congress that once they become aware of this are going to want to do it.
[00:19:38.681 --> 00:19:43.183]  David Codria has written a very good piece in what is it called?
[00:19:44.808 --> 00:19:46.069]  Alright, stay there.
[00:19:46.089 --> 00:19:46.629]  Stay there.
[00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:52.073]  We're going to come back and talk about how we fight this and other attacks on the Second Amendment straight ahead.
[00:19:59.713 --> 00:20:03.974]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[00:20:04.314 --> 00:20:11.856]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over four years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water systems.

[00:21:04.632 --> 00:21:07.357]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:21:07.397 --> 00:21:11.885]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:21:12.759 --> 00:21:17.221]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.

[00:21:58.897 --> 00:22:01.078]  Hi, this is Peter Krochnoble with Midas Resources.
[00:22:01.258 --> 00:22:05.940]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high, and inflation will be a direct result of the spending policy.
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:12.503]  The multiple federal stimulus packages have been an utter failure, unless you're an executive for AIG, a large banking or investment institution.
[00:22:12.644 --> 00:22:15.065]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[00:22:15.145 --> 00:22:17.626]  People like you and I can't go to Washington for a bailout.
[00:22:17.746 --> 00:22:22.688]  Having your hard-earned money in the stock market or any other related paper asset is a lose-lose proposition.
[00:22:22.888 --> 00:22:24.229]  Lose on your capital investment,
[00:22:24.389 --> 00:22:27.590]  And when you cash out, you're paid in the dollar that is losing value every day.
[00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:33.951]  One thing is certain, having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens, your investment will never be worthless.
[00:22:34.111 --> 00:22:37.952]  If you've been thinking about investing in physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[00:22:38.192 --> 00:22:42.553]  Call me today, Peter Krochnay with 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:22:42.673 --> 00:22:47.754]  And I'll take the time to personally put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.

[00:22:50.934 --> 00:22:53.656]  You've worked hard your whole life and I want to work hard for you.
[00:22:53.836 --> 00:22:58.179]  Call Peter Kramschnabel 800 6 8 6 2 2 3 7 extension 1 0 8.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:01.941]  Is it safe to breathe anymore?
[00:23:02.201 --> 00:23:13.307]  Crowded public places, global pandemics and news reports of potential new strains of bacteria and viruses make you wonder what if there was a germ killing nasal spray that acted almost like hand sanitizer for your nose?
[00:23:13.647 --> 00:23:14.228]  There is.
[00:23:14.608 --> 00:23:16.589]  It's called Sinofresh homeopathic nasal
[00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:26.877]  Sinofresh is a revolutionary doctor recommended nasal spray that kills a broad spectrum of viruses, bacteria, molds and fungi on contact in your nose.

[00:23:35.424 --> 00:23:37.886]  Sinofresh must be a part of your family survival plan.

[00:23:54.493 --> 00:23:55.274]  Breathe safe.
[00:23:55.574 --> 00:23:56.434]  Use Sinofresh.
[00:23:56.694 --> 00:23:57.254]  It works.
[00:24:05.404 --> 00:24:08.628]  Larry Pratt, Executive Director, Gun Owners of America.
[00:24:08.728 --> 00:24:09.569]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:12.673]  Thanks for joining us, listeners and viewers.
[00:24:12.753 --> 00:24:24.087]  Southern Poverty Law Center put out a bunch of reports last month attacking myself, Michelle Bachman, Tom Tancredo, Larry Pratt, Oath Keepers, Sheriff Mack,
[00:24:25.131 --> 00:24:36.076]  And with some of the things we cover, a little more racy than these other gribs, but when you start going after Larry Pratt and Michelle Bachman, a very popular congresswoman from Minnesota...
[00:24:37.227 --> 00:24:38.307]  They're really getting desperate.
[00:24:38.427 --> 00:24:42.849]  And every night on MSNBC, you don't like government health care, you're racist.
[00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:45.130]  You don't want big government, you're racist.
[00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:48.190]  You don't want gun control, you're anti-semitic.
[00:24:49.191 --> 00:24:56.613]  I think the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center, Larry, are really destroying any tiny shreds of credibility they have with anybody.
[00:24:56.653 --> 00:24:57.634]  They are so desperate.
[00:24:57.974 --> 00:25:02.075]  They have shown that their thought processes seem to have atrophied.
[00:25:02.715 --> 00:25:08.937]  And pretty soon we can just put them in some museum where we have other mummies and things like that.
[00:25:10.057 --> 00:25:14.938]  I mean, these guys are just absolutely without any arguments.
[00:25:15.698 --> 00:25:24.000]  So they are resorting to, that's different, that's their most polite put down when you make a point that devastates their position.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.600]  Well, my position is different.
[00:25:26.741 --> 00:25:28.921]  And the other is, of course, you're racist.
[00:25:29.501 --> 00:25:31.822]  And as you say, you see it nightly on
[00:25:32.618 --> 00:25:38.740]  MSNBC, so if you want to see how liberals play that, I should say socialists, watch there.
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:49.244]  I kind of enjoy watching MSNBC because it's a first-hand newsletter report from the Communist Party USA.
[00:25:51.449 --> 00:25:53.211]  So I know what the enemy's going to be doing.
[00:25:53.572 --> 00:26:01.300]  And if I want to know what they're up to on socializing medicine and their latest little stratagem trying to get it through the Congress, just tune in.
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:09.009]  You get their talking points right there, but we've also caught them, and Curt Nemo has an article about this up on InfoWars today.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.361]  You'll have 5,000, 10,000, sometimes 100,000 at a tea party.
[00:26:13.601 --> 00:26:17.922]  They'll send one of their operatives in with a racist sign, and they put that on the news.
[00:26:18.182 --> 00:26:21.303]  Then people search their name and find out it's one of their operatives.
[00:26:21.423 --> 00:26:24.884]  I mean, this is really desperate-type activity.
[00:26:24.904 --> 00:26:29.465]  And they're getting so upset that there's all these black people and Hispanics and Oath Keepers.
[00:26:29.965 --> 00:26:31.026]  I mean, look at the front page.
[00:26:31.066 --> 00:26:33.546]  I mean, it's incredible.
[00:26:33.566 --> 00:26:37.307]  They're getting so upset that there's all these brown people at tea parties.
[00:26:37.708 --> 00:26:39.088]  I mean, they are really panicking.
[00:26:39.728 --> 00:26:43.450]  Well, I was just delighted when the attack came out.
[00:26:43.571 --> 00:26:54.337]  I thought, you know, how can it get any better than this when I get lumped in with Michelle Bachmann and all these other cast of characters that are leading the fight for freedom?
[00:26:55.198 --> 00:27:01.662]  That was a good day, and I don't know if they will ever understand how truly pleased and honored I am.
[00:27:02.823 --> 00:27:09.191]  And for them to think that they're hurting us, all they're doing is, as you say, showing that they've lost it.
[00:27:09.571 --> 00:27:14.557]  They really have lost it and we can, as they like to say, we can move on now.
[00:27:15.018 --> 00:27:16.880]  Well here's another reason they're being discredited.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.084]  POTOC, and it's in some of the reports they're putting out on a weekly basis,
[00:27:20.785 --> 00:27:28.171]  I was up on MSNBC a few nights ago, we played it yesterday, and he said, these crazy Tea Party people believe a world government's being formed.
[00:27:28.471 --> 00:27:44.764]  Well, you've got Brown, Gore, Herman Van Rompuy, the head of the UN, Ban Ki-moon in the New York Times with a headline, We Can Do It, calling for world government, calling for global carbon taxes, and then Potok gets up and says, we're conspiracy theorists, we believe there's carbon taxes.
[00:27:44.824 --> 00:27:50.369]  I mean, it's like saying, Larry Pratt's crazy, and Alex Jones is crazy,
[00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:52.410]  They say the sun comes up in the morning.
[00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:53.410]  Exactly.
[00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:55.071]  It doesn't matter what you say.
[00:27:55.511 --> 00:27:56.031]  You're nuts.
[00:27:56.211 --> 00:27:56.952]  You're a racist.
[00:27:57.252 --> 00:28:04.915]  And they hope people might buy that, but they ought to take a look at their business model because it's not working too well.
[00:28:05.515 --> 00:28:09.797]  And who knows when, will it be this year, that the New York Times stops
[00:28:10.257 --> 00:28:20.182]  Publishing a print newspaper and maybe remains as a little vestige of its former self online, where nobody will bump into it even accidentally.
[00:28:20.782 --> 00:28:21.202]  I don't know.
[00:28:21.663 --> 00:28:22.103]  That's right.
[00:28:22.123 --> 00:28:25.985]  If you go to Alexa.com, all the web ratings, New York Times going down.
[00:28:26.665 --> 00:28:27.686]  I've made one misguess on
[00:28:47.853 --> 00:28:48.934]  What Obama was like.
[00:28:49.054 --> 00:28:51.435]  I knew he was a Marxist before the election.
[00:28:51.575 --> 00:28:52.596]  I knew he was a thug.
[00:28:53.597 --> 00:29:00.761]  But I did think he would be more of a Fabian, more of that turtle mascot of theirs moving more deliberately.
[00:29:01.002 --> 00:29:07.806]  But instead, he can't move fast enough to socialize everything that he can get his hands on.
[00:29:08.286 --> 00:29:13.950]  And it's for the I think for the first time, many people in this country now understand that liberalism
[00:29:14.417 --> 00:29:21.888]  has been a smiley face covering the reality of socialism and now they see it in all its ugliness
[00:29:22.836 --> 00:29:27.860]  And they write all these news articles implying guns are illegal to create a false perception.
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:28.681]  It's not working.
[00:29:29.101 --> 00:29:29.942]  They've been exposed.

[00:33:25.646 --> 00:33:27.808]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:27.928 --> 00:33:29.809]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:33:31.291 --> 00:33:38.376]  Jason Bermas is going to pop in for about 10 minutes towards the end of the hour to break down the Cyber Security Act.
[00:33:40.418 --> 00:33:46.343]  Later, after Ron Paul leaves us, I want to get into Coffee Party founder is Obama campaign operative.
[00:33:47.256 --> 00:33:53.059]  Now we announced two months ago, and got the domains a month ago, that I was going to launch a coffee party.
[00:33:53.079 --> 00:34:07.448]  And I'm not going to go out and organize, I'm not going to go out and actually have rallies, just to put the idea out, break down what the coffee party should do, wake up the Tea Party, that it's being taken over by Republicans, controlled establishment partisanship.
[00:34:09.824 --> 00:34:12.205]  And that the Republicans are going to sell us out.
[00:34:12.946 --> 00:34:20.451]  Now, we know Obama is, and now one of his operatives is setting this up and getting all this attention by the media to head off our coffee party.
[00:34:20.511 --> 00:34:25.013]  I should have... I knew I should launch this, and it was listeners' ideas.
[00:34:25.033 --> 00:34:29.496]  A few other people, since they heard about it, have launched similar things, but it's not getting media attention.
[00:34:29.856 --> 00:34:31.638]  We're launching a site in the next few days.
[00:34:31.678 --> 00:34:34.740]  We're going to have some articles about it tomorrow.
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:43.462]  And I've got to get together with Watson and Nemo and kind of write up 15-20 points of why we're doing this and what a real tea party should be.
[00:34:43.922 --> 00:34:45.183]  Hence, the coffee party.
[00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:46.543]  Stronger than tea.
[00:34:47.604 --> 00:34:48.924]  Because we're in serious times.
[00:34:51.165 --> 00:34:51.985]  That is coming up.
[00:34:55.806 --> 00:35:02.148]  There's also another piece that Paul Watson has where the mainstream media is demonizing
[00:35:04.221 --> 00:35:09.664]  Anybody that questions the swine flu shot, saying that we believe that it's space alien DNA.
[00:35:11.606 --> 00:35:19.410]  No, we read the package that says it can cause cancer or sterilize you, or cause Guillain-Barre syndrome or other neurological disorders.
[00:35:20.351 --> 00:35:24.613]  And it's now come out the whole thing was a hoax, a fraud to make money, that it's a dangerous vaccine.
[00:35:24.974 --> 00:35:30.217]  We've had the head of the 47-member commission of the EU on, a doctor, breaking down the fraud of this.
[00:35:31.741 --> 00:35:35.724]  And it's blown up in their face, so now they're running government-funded PSAs demonizing people.
[00:35:35.764 --> 00:35:37.806]  That's coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:35:38.687 --> 00:35:40.408]  But first, I wanted to get into this.
[00:35:40.529 --> 00:35:41.950]  I mean, this is so outrageous.
[00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:56.042]  It's an InfoWars.com article by Aaron Dykes, and he has a larger YouTube video he put together with some of the history of China's one-child policy and what they do to women in China, the forced abortions, the rest of it.
[00:35:57.296 --> 00:35:58.857]  Mao killed, according to the U.S.
[00:35:58.897 --> 00:36:00.939]  government, 64 million people.
[00:36:01.639 --> 00:36:04.121]  The Chinese government says he killed more than 80 million.
[00:36:04.722 --> 00:36:05.442]  But they're proud of it.
[00:36:07.664 --> 00:36:08.885]  He broke up families.
[00:36:09.165 --> 00:36:12.027]  He put tens of millions of people in slave camps.
[00:36:12.167 --> 00:36:15.990]  I mean, this guy turned loose youth corps on the population.
[00:36:16.871 --> 00:36:19.113]  In the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward.
[00:36:19.593 --> 00:36:23.336]  This guy forced tens of millions of farmers off their land, poor farmers, and killed them.
[00:36:24.277 --> 00:36:25.738]  He made Stalin look like a choir boy.
[00:36:27.065 --> 00:36:33.830]  And to have CNN talking about how great communism is and how great Mao Zedong is, that's like in my film Endgame.
[00:36:34.531 --> 00:36:36.552]  We have the actual New York Times article.
[00:36:36.572 --> 00:36:37.633]  We went to UT and got it.
[00:36:38.354 --> 00:36:39.454]  Some of our researchers did.
[00:36:40.075 --> 00:36:43.477]  We should shoot video of us at the UT library getting the actual microfiche.
[00:36:44.298 --> 00:36:47.621]  New York Times, him praising Mao Zedong in 1976.
[00:36:48.682 --> 00:36:50.463]  And saying how great Mao Zedong is.
[00:36:50.863 --> 00:36:52.285]  And how we need that in America.
[00:36:52.825 --> 00:36:55.327]  Why would some of the richest people in the world want communism?
[00:36:55.807 --> 00:36:58.650]  Because they take your money and they organize and run your life.
[00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:01.772]  They break up the family and they give the money and power to themselves.
[00:37:03.313 --> 00:37:04.594]  That's the big dirty secret here.
[00:37:04.634 --> 00:37:08.978]  Look at how our banks and government and corporations have moved almost all our power to China.
[00:37:09.278 --> 00:37:12.641]  Because they're the globalist model of the controlled society.
[00:37:14.002 --> 00:37:22.331]  So this article from Infowars.com titled, CNN Tells Masses That Communism Is Good For Women Despite China's Nightmare Legacy.
[00:37:24.473 --> 00:37:28.437]  And so you watch the short video, Clevin, and you can read through a rundown.
[00:37:28.477 --> 00:37:29.598]  It's a pretty detailed article.
[00:37:30.464 --> 00:37:38.188]  of what's really going on in China, and he's got some extra video clips that are more extensive than what we're about to play here right now.
[00:37:39.348 --> 00:37:40.169]  But here it is.
[00:37:40.249 --> 00:37:44.351]  CNN tells masses communism has been good for women.
[00:37:44.731 --> 00:37:45.071]  Oh, yes.
[00:37:45.191 --> 00:37:46.752]  Oh, women were slaves in the home.
[00:37:46.852 --> 00:37:48.633]  No, women could work in China if they wanted to.
[00:37:49.293 --> 00:37:51.955]  But in the internal government documents from Britain and the U.S.
[00:37:52.215 --> 00:37:54.296]  100 years ago, Edward Bernays and others
[00:37:55.931 --> 00:38:00.134]  Said, and it's now been declassified, Gloria Steinem has admitted she was hired by the CIA with Ms.
[00:38:00.174 --> 00:38:00.574]  Magazine.
[00:38:00.894 --> 00:38:02.395]  How do we tax women as well?
[00:38:02.756 --> 00:38:13.523]  How do we get them in the workforce so we can tax people to such a high level families break up and so the state can raise children?
[00:38:16.725 --> 00:38:19.006]  So this is where they force you to work.
[00:38:19.486 --> 00:38:21.368]  They turn you into a slave.
[00:38:22.395 --> 00:38:28.059]  And here's CNN talking about how wonderful Communist China is, how great it is.
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:35.265]  And they've got little blue Obama books for the school kids now, like Mao Zedong's little red book.
[00:38:35.925 --> 00:38:37.746]  So let's go ahead and play a short clip of CNN.
[00:38:37.786 --> 00:38:38.147]  Here it is.
[00:38:40.663 --> 00:38:52.565]  Chunzhu Li is the president of the All-China Women's Federation, one of the top-ranking women in the Chinese government, and witness to the major changes in women's status since the Communist Revolution.
[00:38:54.548 --> 00:39:03.171]  Among the first laws passed by Chairman Mao's government were statutes banning foot binding, bride selling, dowry, polygamy, and concubines.
[00:39:03.732 --> 00:39:07.473]  Women were invited to leave the home and join the labor force.
[00:39:08.033 --> 00:39:12.575]  Mao spoke those famous words, women hold up half the sky.
[00:39:13.675 --> 00:39:18.177]  If the statistics are any indication, communism has been good for women.
[00:39:20.598 --> 00:39:21.098]  Okay.
[00:39:22.239 --> 00:39:22.439]  Now.
[00:39:24.571 --> 00:39:29.657]  They attach some good things for women to this piece and make it sound like Mao was a great guy.
[00:39:30.278 --> 00:39:33.842]  Women have forced abortions, which Obama supports.
[00:39:35.564 --> 00:39:37.547]  They follow the eugenics model.
[00:39:37.587 --> 00:39:39.589]  It's why they've been industrialized.
[00:39:41.371 --> 00:39:42.491]  Agreements with the U.S.
[00:39:42.531 --> 00:39:47.293]  government and Richard Nixon and George Bush, the Chinese ambassador from the U.S., the U.S.
[00:39:47.353 --> 00:39:49.214]  ambassador to China, to do this.
[00:39:49.254 --> 00:39:50.234]  They launched it in 75.
[00:39:50.674 --> 00:39:53.215]  By 81, it was forced abortion, one-child policy.
[00:39:53.616 --> 00:39:56.317]  Now, they proposed three months ago at Copenhagen and the U.N.
[00:39:57.057 --> 00:39:59.978]  a similar system for here in the United States.
[00:40:01.078 --> 00:40:10.342]  And the White House science czar and countless others, in fact, I'm looking for my eco-science, calls for sterilizing you through vaccines.
[00:40:11.752 --> 00:40:12.433]  We're good to go.
[00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:43.808]  This is so diabolical, ladies and gentlemen, that we've come to the point where Mao Zedong, the greatest mass murderer in all of recorded history, no one has killed more than Mao Zedong, no one debates that, is praised.
[00:40:45.529 --> 00:40:46.250]  Is praised.
[00:40:47.771 --> 00:40:56.096]  Shifting gears, Paul Joseph Watson wrote an article about the government running demonization pieces
[00:40:58.119 --> 00:41:01.262]  In fact, will you guys pull it up because for some reason I couldn't see it in my stack.
[00:41:01.282 --> 00:41:02.222]  I thought I printed it today.
[00:41:06.145 --> 00:41:10.268]  Demonizing anyone who doesn't think the vaccine is good for you.
[00:41:10.608 --> 00:41:12.850]  It's kind of like those corn syrup ads you've seen.
[00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:16.012]  All the studies show it links to diabetes.
[00:41:16.792 --> 00:41:21.696]  All the studies show it's got mercury in it for some reason.
[00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:24.470]  That's Washington Post.
[00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:28.332]  More than, or right at half of corn syrup products have mercury in it.
[00:41:29.872 --> 00:41:33.313]  But they run an ad where the woman's the expert and the man's always an idiot.
[00:41:33.833 --> 00:41:39.335]  Or another neighbor woman's over and the woman explains to her she's a moron that corn syrup's wonderful.
[00:41:40.075 --> 00:41:40.755]  Why do they do that?
[00:41:40.815 --> 00:41:41.856]  Not because women are stupid.
[00:41:43.036 --> 00:41:43.956]  Why do they target women?
[00:41:44.156 --> 00:41:48.778]  They target women because women make over 80% of the household purchases in all the major studies.
[00:41:50.157 --> 00:41:52.339]  And so they know women are the ones reading the back labels.
[00:41:52.699 --> 00:41:57.943]  Notice you can't buy chewing gum now in any store that I've seen that doesn't have aspartame in it, even if it's not sugar-free.
[00:41:59.024 --> 00:41:59.905]  What is aspartame?
[00:41:59.945 --> 00:42:13.255]  It's a genetically engineered E. coli bacteria that they feed toxic waste to, I'm not kidding, that then defecates a poisonous drug that is addictive that is also 61 times sweeter than sugar per gram.
[00:42:14.156 --> 00:42:14.796]  Oh, you don't believe me?
[00:42:14.816 --> 00:42:18.239]  Just search into the term manufacturing process of aspartame.
[00:42:19.611 --> 00:42:27.317]  It is the excrement of a genetically engineered bacteria.
[00:42:27.557 --> 00:42:36.984]  The Pentagon was trying to study chemical weapons in the 60s and came up with this, and they gave it to Donald Rumsfeld at Searle and Monsanto to come out with this.
[00:42:37.425 --> 00:42:39.747]  And I could just go on and on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:40.187 --> 00:42:42.489]  It is an addictive chemical weapon, and they know it.
[00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:49.094]  But hey, they run all these ads explaining, you're kooks, you're crazy, but they wouldn't be running these ads saying,
[00:42:50.467 --> 00:42:51.808]  E. coli poop is good.
[00:42:53.569 --> 00:42:56.350]  They wouldn't be running ads saying mercury is good for your brain.
[00:42:57.110 --> 00:43:06.075]  They wouldn't be running ads saying that all these toxic substances were good if people weren't waking up.
[00:43:06.715 --> 00:43:09.077]  The federal government has dished out money to all the states to run these.
[00:43:09.457 --> 00:43:12.018]  This is a particular clip out of Kentucky.
[00:43:12.038 --> 00:43:14.399]  There's a bunch of states running different variants of these.
[00:43:17.816 --> 00:43:25.161]  If you question the vaccines and think anything in it's bad, you believe in space aliens and that the vaccine is space alien genetics.
[00:43:26.542 --> 00:43:28.424]  So we're going to go ahead and play this clip.
[00:43:29.885 --> 00:43:36.550]  Remember how during the whole swine flu freak out, they would issue fact sheets going, there's no mercury, it can't sterilize you, it can't hurt you.
[00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:39.732]  Then the actual insert that came with the drugs says it does.
[00:43:41.653 --> 00:43:44.596]  So let's go ahead and play this clip.
[00:43:44.636 --> 00:43:44.936]  Here it is.
[00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:52.203]  I hear the H1N1 swine flu vaccine is made from platypus milk.
[00:43:52.523 --> 00:43:52.963]  No, no, no.
[00:43:53.164 --> 00:43:56.606]  It was brought through a portal that only opens every 700 years.
[00:43:56.766 --> 00:43:57.947]  My cousin sent me an email.
[00:43:58.228 --> 00:44:01.730]  Says it makes you susceptible to hypnotic suggestion.
[00:44:02.511 --> 00:44:03.992]  Some folks believe anything.
[00:44:04.353 --> 00:44:08.015]  The swine flu vaccine is safe, effective, and you still need it.
[00:44:08.436 --> 00:44:10.197]  Learn more at Kentucky's flu website.
[00:44:10.678 --> 00:44:13.320]  That way you can separate the fact from the fiction.
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:17.123]  It was developed from secret alien technology found on the moon.
[00:44:19.978 --> 00:44:21.820]  No one is saying any of that.
[00:44:23.301 --> 00:44:35.372]  We're having medical doctors on, and the head of the EU Commission on, who found that Big Pharma made hundreds of millions of payoffs to regulators in the EU, England, the United States, and Canada.
[00:44:36.273 --> 00:44:41.278]  That it is a dangerous vaccine that the German government and military wouldn't even take.
[00:44:41.318 --> 00:44:41.999]  In fact, pull that up.
[00:44:42.019 --> 00:44:44.521]  German military gets added a free vaccine.
[00:44:50.711 --> 00:44:55.355]  We could pull up 31% of homeless given bird flu vaccine die.
[00:44:56.896 --> 00:44:57.596]  London Telegraph.
[00:44:57.837 --> 00:45:00.639]  I mean, the people are dying and getting sick.
[00:45:00.659 --> 00:45:02.821]  The Gardasil shot's killing masses of people.
[00:45:03.181 --> 00:45:04.722]  It's admitted it's killing people.
[00:45:05.022 --> 00:45:07.504]  The Anthrax shot's killed tons of our troops.
[00:45:07.544 --> 00:45:10.006]  The Pentagon even found that nine years ago.
[00:45:10.747 --> 00:45:12.028]  They admitted it and stopped giving it.
[00:45:12.408 --> 00:45:13.709]  But no, we're space aliens.
[00:45:15.492 --> 00:45:16.232]  That's all they do.
[00:45:16.373 --> 00:45:22.216]  And they have the Southern Poverty Law Center gets up on TV and says, you believe in space aliens, you know, you believe there's a world government.
[00:45:22.677 --> 00:45:24.538]  Let's bring Jason Bermas in here, please.
[00:45:25.859 --> 00:45:27.480]  It's now time for him to be on.
[00:45:28.926 --> 00:45:38.652]  I wanted to sit back into this segment and the rest of the next segment to have Jason just read over the bill, because it seems like the mainstream media doesn't even know what's in this Cybersecurity Act.
[00:45:39.012 --> 00:45:42.314]  Then Ron Paul is coming up.
[00:45:42.554 --> 00:45:44.335]  Talk right into that microphone, Burmess.
[00:45:44.375 --> 00:45:44.755]  Thank you.
[00:45:45.095 --> 00:45:51.819]  Jason's done a lot of research on this, and I meant to cover this yesterday, but Jason, you've got the floor at the end of this segment, the next segment, so go over it for us.
[00:45:51.839 --> 00:45:52.860]  Well, thanks so much, Alex.
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:57.483]  What's being set up here is not only a federal
[00:45:58.351 --> 00:46:03.294]  Cyber security program, but also a localized cyber security program.
[00:46:03.554 --> 00:46:14.079]  And this kind of harkened back to you going to SeaWorld and talking about how you are going to be trained from kindergarten up to work on these little mindless computers and surveil everybody.
[00:46:14.319 --> 00:46:15.400]  And that's what this is.
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:22.543]  It literally states that they are going to have scholarships for K through 12 students.
[00:46:23.684 --> 00:46:36.097]  You as a parent will get a note home for your fourth grader that Tommy is going to be in the Junior Computer Genius Society, and he's going to do a summer internship for the federal government.
[00:46:36.457 --> 00:46:41.342]  And it says in here to get these scholarships, and we all know everybody wants a scholarship, everybody's going to need a grant.
[00:46:41.963 --> 00:46:46.347]  We're going into an economic depression, Alex, so everybody's going to clamor to these jobs.
[00:46:46.588 --> 00:46:52.434]  They're going to recruit the best and brightest to run the literal slave grid they've put into place.
[00:46:53.034 --> 00:46:55.977]  And what they're going to do is they're going to use front organizations.
[00:46:56.257 --> 00:46:58.340]  So they're going to use foundations, okay?
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:46:59.781]  They are going to use
[00:47:00.942 --> 00:47:02.863]  The smallest of businesses.
[00:47:02.923 --> 00:47:09.245]  In fact, they're targeting businesses with less than 100 people that they can't get under their thumb immediately with this bill.
[00:47:09.425 --> 00:47:10.566]  With, again, funding.
[00:47:11.066 --> 00:47:19.529]  And this also creates a society where if something is exposed, if they are exposed as illegally wiretapping, surveilling someone illegally, they can localize it.
[00:47:19.549 --> 00:47:22.090]  They can say, no, it's just this foundation front.
[00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:25.972]  It's compartmentalization all in this bill.
[00:47:26.952 --> 00:47:31.613]  It's nightmarish, and the guest you had on yesterday literally said he had not read this thing.
[00:47:31.893 --> 00:47:37.655]  They're going to put the entire internet under the control of the FCC and NIST.
[00:47:38.315 --> 00:47:43.317]  NIST, an organization that has now covered up what really happened at World Trade Center 1, 2, and 7.
[00:47:45.157 --> 00:47:47.238]  For over eight years, Alex.
[00:47:47.618 --> 00:47:56.862]  And with Barry Jennings, who was in Building 7 with the Director of Security, and said there were bombs going off, the fire department told him they saw it happen, then he mysteriously died very quickly.
[00:47:57.282 --> 00:48:00.483]  Now they're saying they have the recordings of these interviews, but they're not going to release them.
[00:48:00.523 --> 00:48:01.484]  That's absolutely correct.
[00:48:01.524 --> 00:48:10.387]  In fact, this week, somebody got the response from their FOIA request to get the recordings of both Michael Hess and Barry Jennings from NIST's own investigation.
[00:48:10.607 --> 00:48:14.189]  They admitted in the documents, oh, these do exist, but they're exempt.
[00:48:14.409 --> 00:48:15.329]  National security.
[00:48:15.389 --> 00:48:16.150]  National security.
[00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:23.433]  Well, they give out the little, they don't actually say national security, they say the little subdivisions, so you have to go look up the clause, but there's four separate clauses on each one.
[00:48:23.453 --> 00:48:24.753]  And they give this national security clause.
[00:48:24.773 --> 00:48:25.614]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:48:25.654 --> 00:48:34.337]  It's unbelievable to me that we would put NIST, NIST, and the FCC in charge of the internet, that we would allow the federal government to come in.
[00:48:34.537 --> 00:48:37.059]  And the new FCC head has said they will control the internet.
[00:48:37.299 --> 00:48:38.879]  Oh, this is full of internet.
[00:48:38.899 --> 00:48:39.880]  We'll start going over it quickly.
[00:48:41.181 --> 00:48:57.702]  So, they're going to create a high-level panel that shall advise the president on matters relating to national cybersecurity program and strategy and shall assess trends and developments in cybersecurity science research and development, progress made in implementing the strategy, the way to revise the strategy, and at the very end,
[00:48:58.203 --> 00:49:02.467]  They say, whether societal and civil liberty concerns are adequately addressed.
[00:49:02.747 --> 00:49:11.456]  Nothing about the Constitution, nothing about the Bill of Rights, nothing about our inherent human rights to be able to live free in our persons and properties, Alex.
[00:49:12.056 --> 00:49:19.683]  Instead, they're going to address the societal and civil liberty concerns, and make sure those concerns are adequately addressed.
[00:49:20.484 --> 00:49:25.867]  Folks, the Constitution and Bill of Rights are being ripped up and torn apart with this bill.
[00:49:26.147 --> 00:49:28.529]  Support of regional cybersecurity.
[00:49:28.869 --> 00:49:31.391]  So they're going to get into the business of your counties.
[00:49:31.931 --> 00:49:33.932]  It's not just going to be state and federal again.
[00:49:34.152 --> 00:49:36.914]  They're going after every major hub.
[00:49:37.594 --> 00:49:38.395]  All networks.
[00:49:38.435 --> 00:49:41.517]  This is total control of the internet.
[00:49:41.977 --> 00:49:46.438]  The regional centers are for the promotion and implementation of cybersecurity standards.
[00:49:46.778 --> 00:49:51.420]  Each center shall be affiliated with the United States-based non-profit institution or organization.
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:53.720]  These are the front groups that they're going to be putting together.
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:50:00.262]  Or a consortium thereof that applies for and is awarded financial assistance under this section.
[00:50:01.266 --> 00:50:05.969]  Now they're also going to standardize all software and hardware under NIST.
[00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:17.617]  The transfer of cybersecurity standards, process technology, and techniques developed in the National Institute of Standards and Technology, two centers, and through them, small, medium-sized companies throughout the United States.
[00:50:17.677 --> 00:50:18.377]  It's everybody.
[00:50:18.638 --> 00:50:21.399]  And you have to have a federally approved person in your business.
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:23.761]  Everything has to have government software running on it.
[00:50:24.121 --> 00:50:26.683]  They're totally taking over the infrastructure of the Internet.
[00:50:26.923 --> 00:50:34.273]  Absolutely, and that's why they want the K-12 students so that they can actually certify them while they're still in school and then recruit them immediately out of high school.
[00:50:34.533 --> 00:50:35.074]  Immediately.
[00:50:35.274 --> 00:50:35.795]  All right, stay there.
[00:50:35.815 --> 00:50:37.637]  We've only got five minutes left before Ron Paul comes up.
[00:50:38.078 --> 00:50:40.020]  Race through the actual subsections for people.
[00:50:40.541 --> 00:50:41.542]  This is the House version.
[00:50:41.582 --> 00:50:42.684]  The Senate is even worse.
[00:50:43.064 --> 00:50:44.666]  You got Senator Jay Rockefeller saying...
[00:50:45.583 --> 00:50:46.304]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:50:46.344 --> 00:50:50.827]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:50:50.847 --> 00:50:52.908]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[00:51:07.638 --> 00:51:10.419]  Non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold.
[00:51:10.819 --> 00:51:11.219]  It's true.
[00:51:11.299 --> 00:51:13.880]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:15.900]  And it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:21.081]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:51:21.621 --> 00:51:23.542]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:51:23.922 --> 00:51:28.543]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:51:28.723 --> 00:51:29.623]  And here's the best part.
[00:51:29.843 --> 00:51:32.624]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:51:32.924 --> 00:51:36.205]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:51:36.525 --> 00:51:39.368]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:51:39.728 --> 00:51:41.609]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:42.710]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:42.991]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:51:43.031 --> 00:51:46.033]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:51:46.533 --> 00:51:48.255]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:51:59.292 --> 00:52:05.306]  In today's world, a product comes along that revolutionizes the way we live, work and play.

[00:52:58.982 --> 00:52:59.302]  Hello!
[00:52:59.622 --> 00:53:04.045]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[00:53:04.385 --> 00:53:08.888]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[00:53:09.208 --> 00:53:14.011]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[00:53:14.272 --> 00:53:18.914]  As a homesteader attempting to live sustainably, I was floored by the amount of information in this book.
[00:53:18.934 --> 00:53:23.037]  Dear Linda, I would be hard-pressed to express how much you have impacted my life.
[00:53:23.137 --> 00:53:27.340]  I'm amazed by the wealth of the author's knowledge and the depth of the coverage in this book.
[00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:31.923]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves, this information is good to know.
[00:53:32.083 --> 00:53:34.224]  I am thankful to God for you, Linda.
[00:53:34.244 --> 00:53:36.206]  I can't say enough about this book.
[00:53:36.306 --> 00:53:38.127]  Blessings to you and your family.
[00:53:38.227 --> 00:53:43.711]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Earth's bounty everywhere.
[00:53:43.931 --> 00:53:46.933]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[00:53:47.333 --> 00:53:50.756]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[00:53:50.937 --> 00:53:58.143]  You can order online for you and your loved ones, or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[00:54:04.409 --> 00:54:07.272]  This always seems to happen when Ron Paul's on the hill.
[00:54:07.292 --> 00:54:10.394]  We're gonna get 30 minutes with him, we're getting 15, he's gotta go to a vote.
[00:54:13.531 --> 00:54:15.713]  2-15 Eastern, 1-15 Central.
[00:54:16.513 --> 00:54:20.097]  Burmas, finish up with some of the Cyber Security Act for people that don't know what's in it.
[00:54:20.457 --> 00:54:36.933]  Sure, I just want to go over how all software configuration will go through NIST, through the FCC, through the Department of Homeland Security that was absorbed by the NSA and really set up by the NSA as a domestic spy front for all United States citizens.
[00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:55.531]  Okay, so now all software will have to be an established standard of computer-readable language for completely specifying the configuration of software on computer systems, widely used in federal government, by government contractors and grantees, and in the private sector-owned critical infrastructure.
[00:54:56.452 --> 00:55:00.174]  All of the major private sector is critical infrastructure.
[00:55:00.194 --> 00:55:03.016]  So this is standardized software across the board.
[00:55:03.056 --> 00:55:05.697]  I think you're going to see the death of things like Linux.
[00:55:05.717 --> 00:55:15.742]  You're going to have to go to the Wares or IRC boards or the torrent sites to try, eventually, to use blacklisted software.
[00:55:16.002 --> 00:55:17.003]  The same with hardware.
[00:55:17.583 --> 00:55:24.372]  I mean, it's all here, Alex, and there will be national compliance standards for all software.
[00:55:24.632 --> 00:55:25.853]  So they don't like your software?
[00:55:26.254 --> 00:55:27.696]  Forget about antitrust.
[00:55:27.896 --> 00:55:30.920]  You won't be able to compete in the system because they won't allow it.
[00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:34.564]  They'll just rip it off and put it under a Microsoft or Mac brand.
[00:55:35.373 --> 00:55:38.315]  And unfortunately, the public is going to clamor for it.
[00:55:39.076 --> 00:55:47.962]  Again, this bill, Alex, passed in the House with over 400 plus votes for it, and five votes against it, one of them Ron Paul, I might add.
[00:55:48.622 --> 00:55:50.843]  And when you went to the congressional page,
[00:55:51.904 --> 00:55:54.426]  Over 94% of the people were against it.
[00:55:54.767 --> 00:55:57.789]  How is this a representation of we the people?
[00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.690]  It's not.
[00:55:59.110 --> 00:56:00.351]  International standards.
[00:56:00.592 --> 00:56:10.680]  The director through the institute and in coordination with appropriate federal agencies shall be responsible for the United States representation in all international standards development related to cyber security.
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:12.202]  So I guess we should be like China.
[00:56:12.822 --> 00:56:16.544]  I guess we should move towards Australia-style censored internet.
[00:56:16.624 --> 00:56:17.505]  That's what's in here.
[00:56:17.525 --> 00:56:19.226]  Well, CNN says Mao's good.
[00:56:19.246 --> 00:56:21.487]  He killed more people than anybody in history, but he's good.
[00:56:21.747 --> 00:56:23.428]  Think of the outrageousness of that.
[00:56:23.888 --> 00:56:24.329]  Absolutely.
[00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:35.535]  In Invisible Empire, we cover how on the 60th anniversary of Mao and his communist regime, we decided to light up the Empire State Building in those communist colors because we love them so much, Alex.
[00:56:35.955 --> 00:56:36.636]  That's disgusting.
[00:56:37.116 --> 00:56:42.658]  But then meanwhile neocons criticize me for going on Russia Today and talking bad about communism.
[00:56:43.458 --> 00:56:46.739]  When the neocons were founded by the Trotskyites and are communist.
[00:56:47.339 --> 00:56:48.139]  You just can't win.
[00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:51.401]  The communists can literally kill millions of people in history.
[00:56:51.441 --> 00:56:54.561]  Our government created the communists and the UN on record.
[00:56:55.822 --> 00:56:57.302]  Our government is a bunch of banks.
[00:56:58.063 --> 00:56:59.843]  People better figure this out fast.
[00:57:00.203 --> 00:57:02.704]  And they don't like Russia because they kicked the communists out.
[00:57:02.784 --> 00:57:03.184]  That's true.
[00:57:03.444 --> 00:57:05.305]  They kicked the Rothschild bankers out.
[00:57:06.238 --> 00:57:06.639]  On record.
[00:57:07.279 --> 00:57:09.081]  Let me just go over just a few more things of this.
[00:57:09.221 --> 00:57:11.223]  We've dirty, filthy commies out there.
[00:57:11.343 --> 00:57:13.165]  All you neocons saying I'm a commie.
[00:57:13.385 --> 00:57:14.827]  Everybody knows you're the scum.
[00:57:16.068 --> 00:57:20.252]  We've talked before about them regulating broadband internet.
[00:57:20.292 --> 00:57:23.515]  In other words, you're going to start paying per megabyte, per gigabyte.
[00:57:23.535 --> 00:57:26.759]  But the key there is once the government gives you free broadband that you pay for,
[00:57:27.958 --> 00:57:31.780]  But then, the FCC says because it's broadcast, they will control it and put their software in.
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:33.221]  That is where I'm going with this.
[00:57:33.301 --> 00:57:35.562]  Mandatory licensing through the FCC.
[00:57:35.602 --> 00:57:38.464]  So after they take it over, you'll have to get mandatory licensing.
[00:57:38.604 --> 00:57:44.888]  Look, look, look, I want to go to calls, but since Ron Paul's getting cut short today, just, at the 20 after, come in another 10 minutes.
[00:57:45.528 --> 00:57:48.990]  Because, I mean, I want to just start through the whole thing, run through it in one segment.
[00:57:49.210 --> 00:57:49.610]  Absolutely.
[00:58:11.827 --> 00:58:16.051]  Get the articles out that Curt Nemo and Paul Watson have written for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:58:16.371 --> 00:58:17.653]  We have a chance of turning this around.
[00:58:17.913 --> 00:58:19.494]  Absolutely, and this isn't a daunting bill.
[00:58:19.514 --> 00:58:20.896]  This is only 50 plus pages.
[00:58:21.136 --> 00:58:22.717]  I got through this in less than 20 minutes.
[00:58:22.958 --> 00:58:26.581]  As an American citizen, don't you think it's your duty to know what they're about to pass?
[00:58:26.801 --> 00:58:28.303]  Alright, we haven't even scratched the surface.
[00:58:28.323 --> 00:58:29.264]  Burma, she'll be back in here.
[00:58:29.284 --> 00:58:33.167]  I am going to have open phones and news blitz in the last hour and a half of the show.
[00:58:33.468 --> 00:58:36.731]  That's all coming up, but we'll see if Ron Paul is going to be joining us straight ahead.
[00:58:40.259 --> 00:58:43.642]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:43.662 --> 00:58:45.803]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:48.385 --> 00:58:52.629]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:52.949 --> 00:58:53.549]  Number one.
[00:58:53.850 --> 00:58:56.992]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:57.272 --> 00:58:57.833]  Number two.
[00:58:58.133 --> 00:59:02.696]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:03.037 --> 00:59:03.477]  It's true.
[00:59:03.777 --> 00:59:08.321]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:08.621 --> 00:59:09.162]  Number 3.
[00:59:09.442 --> 00:59:12.745]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:13.045 --> 00:59:16.788]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:16.969 --> 00:59:17.209]  Number 4.
[00:59:17.749 --> 00:59:20.131]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:20.512 --> 00:59:23.915]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:24.195 --> 00:59:24.415]  Number 5.
[00:59:24.996 --> 00:59:28.919]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:33.904]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:34.184 --> 00:59:38.205]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:38.345 --> 00:59:39.905]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:40.125 --> 00:59:42.226]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:59:42.386 --> 00:59:44.966]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:44.986 --> 00:59:53.468]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:53.888 --> 01:00:01.209]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:03.310 --> 01:00:03.890]  Big Brother.
[01:00:04.611 --> 01:00:05.652]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:06.373 --> 01:00:07.454]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:08.135 --> 01:00:08.936]  You want answers?
[01:00:09.717 --> 01:00:10.638]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:11.259 --> 01:00:14.943]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:15.464 --> 01:00:19.528]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.181 --> 01:00:29.703]  We always look forward to our once a month visit with Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:00:29.763 --> 01:00:31.063]  He's got to go in 14 minutes.
[01:00:31.483 --> 01:00:33.424]  I got my atomic clock to a key vote.
[01:00:34.024 --> 01:00:35.045]  Got to be in a committee room.
[01:00:35.385 --> 01:00:36.285]  So he's with us now.
[01:00:36.366 --> 01:00:37.366]  I'm going to move quickly.
[01:00:37.826 --> 01:00:41.528]  First off, Congressman, you won the straw poll at CPAC.
[01:00:42.749 --> 01:00:45.912]  Proving that most of the Republicans are not warmongering neocons.
[01:00:45.932 --> 01:00:48.055]  You got 84% approval rating in Texas.
[01:00:48.355 --> 01:00:50.697]  You won by a record 80% in the primary.
[01:00:51.138 --> 01:00:54.421]  Showing that America supports what you're doing.
[01:00:54.762 --> 01:00:59.247]  Can you comment on the fact that, well, your take on this?
[01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:07.443]  I was very pleased and somewhat surprised, but it was a delight to have won that CPAC vote.
[01:01:08.003 --> 01:01:12.525]  You know, what was interesting is, you know, the people who oppose us, they're still significant.
[01:01:12.545 --> 01:01:18.528]  If I get 32 percent of the vote, that means there's a large number still complaining, and they're part of the establishment.
[01:01:18.808 --> 01:01:23.490]  But what I thought was interesting is all the sour grapes that was expressed afterwards.
[01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:26.892]  They were complaining, and, oh, this is not for real, you know, like they did in the campaign.
[01:01:27.552 --> 01:01:35.600]  But what was interesting is somebody said that, you know, what we need to do is for CPAC to have any credibility, they have to change the way they vote.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:48.152]  So somebody made the suggestion that nobody under 25 would be allowed to vote, which means, and you know it too, that there are a lot of young people who are interested in what we're talking about, and I think that's fortunate.
[01:01:48.172 --> 01:01:49.453]  You know, the next generation is
[01:01:50.033 --> 01:01:53.116]  Not later on, but currently they're inheriting this mess.
[01:01:53.336 --> 01:02:01.742]  So I'm delighted to talk to young people, but this whole idea that the people who don't like us challenging the status quo, well, let's not let them vote next time.
[01:02:01.842 --> 01:02:12.311]  But I think that there's a lot of people who are coming our way every year, and you know in the last two or three years that there's been tremendous growth in our movement, and that makes me very encouraged.
[01:02:13.388 --> 01:02:13.988]  Absolutely.
[01:02:14.088 --> 01:02:19.011]  I want to cut to the chase here, and before we get into the banking situation.
[01:02:19.591 --> 01:02:26.474]  A few months ago, you were speaking at a Campaign for Liberty event, and you threw the gauntlet down, as you did back in the 80s in some videos I've seen.
[01:02:26.774 --> 01:02:29.356]  You said, we've had a CIA coup in America.
[01:02:29.636 --> 01:02:30.716]  They're bringing in the drugs.
[01:02:30.816 --> 01:02:36.579]  Most people don't know, in 96, the CIA inspector general before Congress admitted that.
[01:02:37.219 --> 01:02:38.160]  But it's wider than that.
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.001]  We know Wall Street and the banking cartel
[01:02:40.521 --> 01:02:59.617]  The Federal Reserve System, through Yale and other outfits, set up the OSS and CIA, and you came right out and basically said, this is our illegitimate government, and that ties into the banks engineering the financial collapse, now saying they're getting ready for an even bigger collapse sometime this year in a constitution of the world run by the banks.
[01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:08.065]  As Gordon Brown and others called for, can you specifically speak to who runs the coup, who they are, and how we remove them?
[01:03:08.105 --> 01:03:12.490]  Because by openly coming out and really telling it like it is, we can cut to the chase.
[01:03:12.895 --> 01:03:25.841]  Well, I have trouble naming names because I don't know all the names, but the one thing I can verify is that the people who should have responsibility for our national security and intelligence gathering, the U.S.
[01:03:25.881 --> 01:03:28.642]  Congress, they have no idea what's going on.
[01:03:29.082 --> 01:03:30.363]  And that's the real problem.
[01:03:31.014 --> 01:03:38.799]  And it fits together, you know, the secrecy of the CIA as well as the secrecy of the Fed.
[01:03:38.819 --> 01:03:41.321]  They control the money and they control secret government.
[01:03:41.341 --> 01:03:53.008]  People have referred to the CIA as a secret army for the president, but sometimes I wonder whether the president even has total control of the CIA as well, as many stories have been written about that.
[01:03:53.655 --> 01:03:58.416]  So it's something that I think the American people have to realize.
[01:03:58.936 --> 01:04:04.998]  We do know, there's been evidence brought forth that the CIA actually can own banks.
[01:04:05.338 --> 01:04:10.939]  And there's been fairly strong evidence that the CIA's been involved in drug dealing.
[01:04:11.099 --> 01:04:17.901]  There are times when I think the war in Afghanistan, we say it has to do with pipes and oil, gas pipeline and oil.
[01:04:18.781 --> 01:04:18.881]  Yes.
[01:04:34.227 --> 01:04:48.964]  I don't take the position that I know all those answers, and I don't know everything that the Fed does, but my approach is that we, the people, the people deserve, and the Congress has a responsibility to find out what they're doing.
[01:04:49.544 --> 01:04:51.786]  And if they're not doing it, fine and dandy.
[01:04:51.826 --> 01:04:52.627]  We'll clear the air.
[01:04:52.667 --> 01:05:02.535]  But if they are doing it, it will give us more ammunition for the reason why we need a different monetary system, and we need to have a different system of collecting intelligence, because they can tell us anything.
[01:05:02.896 --> 01:05:04.817]  Remember how we went to war in Iraq?
[01:05:04.877 --> 01:05:06.839]  The CIA was very much involved.
[01:05:06.899 --> 01:05:11.723]  Up there, they say, the CIA, oh, they have weapons of mass destruction.
[01:05:11.743 --> 01:05:12.984]  They're about to attack us.
[01:05:13.465 --> 01:05:15.587]  And it was based on false information.
[01:05:16.207 --> 01:05:24.530]  And this is what disturbs me the most, and that's why I want much, much more transparency of what our government is doing.
[01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:28.992]  Well, those were strong statements you made a few months ago, and you just echoed them.
[01:05:29.432 --> 01:05:36.135]  But specifically, Congress, as you know, has had hearings in the 70s about the shadow government, continuity of government.
[01:05:36.775 --> 01:05:41.557]  The Homeland Security Committee in the House has not been allowed to see the full text of PDD 51.
[01:05:42.917 --> 01:05:47.699]  We know we've seen a 12-fold in the last eight-year increase in opium out of Afghanistan.
[01:05:48.379 --> 01:05:58.943]  We know that two years ago, a CIA aircraft that had been used for torture flights crashed in Mexico with pure cocaine, three and a half tons, meaning coming directly from the source, uncut.
[01:05:58.963 --> 01:06:04.505]  I mean, this just comes out in Mena, Arkansas, over and over again.
[01:06:04.525 --> 01:06:08.227]  And so when you talk about a coup over America,
[01:06:09.427 --> 01:06:11.828]  How do we ever ferret this out and remove it?
[01:06:11.988 --> 01:06:16.330]  I mean, do we start, as you've been calling for, an audit of the private Federal Reserve?
[01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:19.651]  Yeah, it won't happen until the people become really outraged.
[01:06:19.711 --> 01:06:30.316]  They are growing in their outrage, but it has to translate into different ideas and different respect for the Constitution, different people up here, and we're in the midst of this transition.
[01:06:31.036 --> 01:06:40.964]  As the crisis worsens, the real challenge is, will we end up with a dictatorship, or are we going to have people who are demanding a republic and open government?
[01:06:41.124 --> 01:06:48.030]  And that might take another 10, 15 years to determine, but in the midst of a crisis, it's the worst time to present our views.
[01:06:48.730 --> 01:07:06.399]  That's why we have to do our best to get as many people to agree with us as possible so that in the rebuilding that we have some ideas about what the monetary system should be like and what our foreign policy ought to be like, which means that if we had a proper foreign policy, the incentive to have this
[01:07:07.159 --> 01:07:13.664]  I don't believe that we shouldn't have some intelligence gathering, but I don't like these clandestine operations and killings and things that we've known to have happen.
[01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:54.164]  Well, dovetailing with that, you grilled Bernanke a few days ago, and then the chairman, for those who haven't seen the video, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com, Frank, agreed with you and said, we need an investigation of the admitted, and I went and pulled the articles up, because Bernanke was acting like it was preposterous, but it's on record that BCCI and the Federal Reserve, it's on record in 2004 and 5, tens of billions of dollars from the Federal Reserve shipped on pallets into Iraq,
[01:07:55.004 --> 01:08:01.350]  It's on record, Associated Press, that tens of billions of drug money has been found in the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
[01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:04.553]  That was in 2000, that was in the AP.
[01:08:04.993 --> 01:08:07.676]  And then Bernanke just laughs at you and says it doesn't exist.
[01:08:07.736 --> 01:08:21.949]  It's like POTOC from the Southern Poverty Law Center laughing and saying, these Tea Party kooks believe in a world government, when you've got every global leader calling for global government, the IMF calling for a new world order, Herman Van Rompuy, Ban Ki-moon calling for it.
[01:08:22.409 --> 01:08:26.392]  I mean, I think they're really destroying what credibility they had left by stonewalling us.
[01:08:26.632 --> 01:08:37.980]  Can you speak specifically to congressional investigations separate from an audit, just directly on, you know, is the Federal Reserve involved in Greece?
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:41.042]  Well, we know they gave the money to Goldman Sachs and we know they are involved.
[01:08:42.183 --> 01:08:51.393]  No, and he used the word bizarre, so he was accusing me of being bizarre, which means anybody who agrees with my concerns are considered bizarre as well.
[01:08:51.973 --> 01:08:58.740]  And you're right in commenting about what Barney Frank said at the end, at the end of my questioning, that we should look into it.
[01:08:59.161 --> 01:09:03.545]  And to his credit, he has sent a letter to the chairman.
[01:09:03.906 --> 01:09:05.888]  Bernanke and Carbon copied me.
[01:09:06.688 --> 01:09:13.755]  And he's insisting that the Federal Reserve respond to my charges, look into it.
[01:09:13.915 --> 01:09:23.625]  He asked Bernanke to contact my office to go over the details of the concerns that I've had, and then report back.
[01:09:24.085 --> 01:09:25.946]  So, Barney Frank did follow up with it.
[01:09:26.066 --> 01:09:35.993]  Interestingly, Barney Frank was involved with Henry Gonzales, and you know that Henry Gonzales was against the Federal Reserve and demanded these investigations.
[01:09:36.093 --> 01:09:42.137]  And the gentleman that wrote the book from the University of Texas, he worked with Gonzales.
[01:09:42.477 --> 01:09:43.998]  So he has first-hand information.
[01:09:44.038 --> 01:09:46.459]  To call this bizarre is off the wall.
[01:09:49.281 --> 01:09:57.908]  The Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the Congress on the Banking Committee for 17 years was involved in these investigations.
[01:09:58.349 --> 01:10:01.491]  And to just write it off and say, this is, I've never heard it.
[01:10:01.792 --> 01:10:14.862]  So, you know, when he said that, it sort of reminded me about, you know, the debates when the mayor, you know, shouted, and I can't believe this stuff, you know.
[01:10:15.523 --> 01:10:16.324]  What are you saying?
[01:10:17.375 --> 01:10:18.076]  It's incredible.
[01:10:18.316 --> 01:10:20.418]  We've only got four minutes left with Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:10:20.438 --> 01:10:22.320]  We appreciate him joining us live today.
[01:10:23.061 --> 01:10:30.668]  The New York Times is reporting they may try to revive the carbon tax with a direct tax on fuel at the refinery.
[01:10:30.788 --> 01:10:36.674]  Senate trio hopes to hit pay dirt with carbon fee at the oil company's request.
[01:10:37.575 --> 01:10:40.178]  Where is the carbon tax going as well as health care?
[01:10:40.828 --> 01:10:49.113]  Well, it's hard for me to believe they'll do that, even though it's alive and they want to, and that's their goal, and they will if they can.
[01:10:49.673 --> 01:10:55.977]  But under these conditions, it's so bad of an idea, it just blows my mind to think that they'll pursue that.
[01:10:56.437 --> 01:11:04.641]  Though I don't know the details on whether that's going to go through or not, but I can guarantee you there's plenty up here who still believe in it and will pursue it.
[01:11:04.782 --> 01:11:08.784]  But I hope they come to their senses and realize how detrimental it would be.
[01:11:09.497 --> 01:11:13.078]  There's a Mary Landrieu quote in here saying, we need to pass this.
[01:11:13.138 --> 01:11:14.778]  This is going to help Americans.
[01:11:15.459 --> 01:11:16.279]  I mean, how bizarre.
[01:11:16.339 --> 01:11:17.979]  More taxes, people are going bankrupt.
[01:11:18.519 --> 01:11:25.541]  In closing, Congressman, we've now discovered that an Obama campaign operative has founded a coffee party.
[01:11:25.881 --> 01:11:32.443]  I actually had this idea with listeners two months ago to get real constitutionalists to take the tea parties back from the neocons.
[01:11:33.543 --> 01:11:44.914]  Now it turns out Obama picked up this idea and that his campaign operatives are now getting all this media attention to tell us to love our federal government, that it's our federal government.
[01:11:45.234 --> 01:11:55.724]  I mean, that shows how powerful the Tea Parties are, if not just the Republican establishment, but now the Democrats are flooding in trying to pose as patriots.
[01:11:57.782 --> 01:11:59.323]  Yeah, they want us to love the government.
[01:11:59.343 --> 01:12:02.646]  How about loving our country and understanding what freedom is all about?
[01:12:03.226 --> 01:12:04.827]  But the battle is out there.
[01:12:04.847 --> 01:12:16.816]  I mean, one thing is they're starting to recognize that the battle may be outside of the conventional wisdom of Republicans and Democrats that run Washington and actually the discussion going on in the independent Tea Party type movement.
[01:12:17.356 --> 01:12:25.479]  And there's no reason to think that everybody is going to believe the right thing and get together and do the right thing in those who are objecting.
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:39.305]  But anybody who's involved better realize that if a significant movement erupts like the Tea Party movement, there will be plenty left and right, and everybody else who has a special interest will want to get in and try to control it.
[01:12:39.718 --> 01:12:45.740]  Well, to see the establishment trying to pose as anti-establishment is truly sickening, but I mean, look at your 84% approval rating.
[01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:46.800]  People know the real McCoy.
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:47.961]  One minute left.
[01:12:48.401 --> 01:13:00.724]  The economy, a lot of top economists are now agreeing with you and others that we may have a mega-depression in the next 16 months, and they're positioning the IMF and World Bank with a new global constitution where they will pose as saviors again.
[01:13:01.005 --> 01:13:05.366]  How concerned are you that this recession could get a lot worse?
[01:13:05.831 --> 01:13:17.403]  Well, I think it is going to get a lot worse, and what is happening now is Wall Street's recovered and a few companies have recovered, but the unemployment rate is still very high and getting worse.
[01:13:18.083 --> 01:13:29.515]  And there will be plans, I'm sure they've been talking about it for quite a few years, because those who run the international banking system know that they're in trouble, so they are laying plans for this.
[01:13:30.462 --> 01:13:39.509]  People do ask me about, well, do you think this will bring on the North American Union and, you know, North American currency?
[01:13:39.909 --> 01:13:40.770]  And I really don't think so.
[01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:47.796]  I think the bigger concern should be a worldwide currency and the IMF and the United Nations grabbing hold and trying to dictate to us.
[01:13:48.036 --> 01:13:57.683]  But we have economic laws on our side because, you know, you can propose these things and even if it does serve the special interest, if it violates economic law, it won't work.
[01:13:57.723 --> 01:13:59.945]  So they can't maintain a good currency.
[01:14:00.305 --> 01:14:03.328]  And that's why I think the European Union is very, very fragile.
[01:14:03.388 --> 01:14:06.932]  Not only the euro, but the union as well, because it's artificial.
[01:14:07.232 --> 01:14:11.777]  And I think that's what would happen on a world government and a world currency.
[01:14:12.097 --> 01:14:21.967]  But in the meantime, it could get pretty messy, and they're going to work very hard to get organized, which means they'll work hard to undermine our personal liberties.
[01:14:22.659 --> 01:14:23.780]  Congressman, we're going to let you go.
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:31.223]  In closing, I just want to say, no one in Congress that I've ever studied works as hard as you, does as much media, writes as much legislation.
[01:14:31.543 --> 01:14:32.844]  You are a champion.
[01:14:32.944 --> 01:14:33.564]  God bless you.
[01:14:33.644 --> 01:14:34.205]  Thank you very much.
[01:14:34.245 --> 01:14:34.505]  Got to go.
[01:14:34.905 --> 01:14:35.285]  Take care.
[01:14:35.305 --> 01:14:36.686]  There he goes to run to his vote.
[01:14:36.926 --> 01:14:38.407]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:14:38.427 --> 01:14:43.369]  I mean, that guy is on TV about 10 times a day, does about 10 radio interviews.
[01:14:43.409 --> 01:14:44.529]  I've talked to his press people.
[01:14:45.070 --> 01:14:50.932]  Folks, I do four hours a day and do two or three interviews a day, and I'm constantly turning them down because at 36 years old,
[01:14:54.042 --> 01:14:55.103]  I mean, I'm exhausted.
[01:14:55.784 --> 01:14:58.546]  And that guy's 74 years old.
[01:14:59.567 --> 01:15:02.529]  And just works so hard.
[01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:05.011]  And I'm just honored that I've been interviewing him since 1996.
[01:15:08.334 --> 01:15:11.777]  And that he has never changed, never flip-flopped.
[01:15:11.837 --> 01:15:13.078]  He's absolutely amazing.
[01:15:13.459 --> 01:15:14.780]  Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:15:16.252 --> 01:15:18.734]  Eighty percent of the vote in the Texas primary.
[01:15:19.114 --> 01:15:19.675]  Unheard of.
[01:15:20.055 --> 01:15:21.977]  Eighty-four percent approval rating in polls.
[01:15:22.717 --> 01:15:23.698]  Ron Paul.
[01:15:24.179 --> 01:15:26.020]  But, oh, he's a kook.
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:32.305]  He's a, you know, it's outrageous that the Federal Reserve's involved in bailouts or money laundering.
[01:15:32.605 --> 01:15:35.007]  And Bernanke will get up there and say, we've made all the money public.
[01:15:35.027 --> 01:15:36.829]  And then they say, OK, make this public.
[01:15:36.849 --> 01:15:37.870]  Well, we're not going to make that public.
[01:15:38.190 --> 01:15:40.191]  They think viewers on TV are so stupid.
[01:15:40.592 --> 01:15:43.434]  They get up in front of the Congress and lie in front of everyone.
[01:15:44.315 --> 01:15:45.176]  Unbelievable.
[01:15:49.829 --> 01:15:50.749]  You know what I'm going to do?
[01:15:51.589 --> 01:15:53.110]  Go ahead and get Jason Burmas in here.
[01:15:54.230 --> 01:16:02.413]  I'm going to let Jason take my seat right now for this segment and the next segment so he can really cover cyber security for people because I could do it as well.
[01:16:05.077 --> 01:16:10.201]  We've been trying for two days to get him in here at one sitting to be able to cover all of this.
[01:16:11.201 --> 01:16:16.545]  And so, what we're going to do is... Burmus, go ahead and get your headphones on, because you need to jack in right here.
[01:16:16.565 --> 01:16:17.366]  I'm going to let you sit here.
[01:16:18.487 --> 01:16:19.727]  Well, you know, you can sit over there, can't you?
[01:16:19.787 --> 01:16:20.868]  We'll just turn my mic off.
[01:16:21.068 --> 01:16:22.289]  Okay, go ahead and jack in there.
[01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:26.212]  And we're going to have you go over this in this segment and the next segment.
[01:16:26.652 --> 01:16:29.214]  Do it as focused as you can, because you're only going to have about ten minutes of air time.
[01:16:30.495 --> 01:16:32.797]  And then I'm going to come back, but I'm not going to interrupt you.
[01:16:33.929 --> 01:16:37.730]  And then we're going to open the phones up and get into a ton of other news I haven't even scratched the surface on yet.
[01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:43.912]  But again, no one has read this that I've seen, except Paul Watson, Steve Watson, Curtin MOU, and myself.
[01:16:44.012 --> 01:16:49.974]  We've all written articles, broken it down the last month, but no one else seems to be getting just how evil this is.
[01:16:50.894 --> 01:16:51.434]  Go through it.
[01:16:51.835 --> 01:16:53.496]  Jason Bermas, Cybersecurity Act.
[01:16:53.936 --> 01:16:56.998]  And then we're going to open the phones up for first-time callers today at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:16:57.018 --> 01:16:57.118]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:16:57.178 --> 01:16:57.718]  Jason Bermas.
[01:17:05.259 --> 01:17:10.222]  Alright, let's just take it from the top on the Cybersecurity Act that did pass the House.
[01:17:10.302 --> 01:17:10.783]  Section 1.
[01:17:11.943 --> 01:17:12.984]  What is this thing?
[01:17:13.304 --> 01:17:14.305]  What is the overview?
[01:17:14.845 --> 01:17:18.988]  Well, first of all, they're going to create a Cybersecurity Advisory Panel.
[01:17:19.448 --> 01:17:30.135]  So, the Office of Cybersecurity is already going to be a new bureaucracy, and then they will pick bureaucrats that are allegianced to globalist world dictatorships as their board.
[01:17:30.435 --> 01:17:33.517]  Real-time Cybersecurity Dashboard.
[01:17:34.673 --> 01:17:42.696]  Now what that means is they will have a grid for all CCTV cameras, whether they be in the private sector or the government sector.
[01:17:42.716 --> 01:17:57.281]  So it won't just be the CCTV cameras that are outside of the Federal Reserve Building in D.C., which is not a government organization, or the ones outside of the halls of Congress, or the White House, or the ones that are supposedly protecting us in the subways of New York City.
[01:17:57.501 --> 01:18:01.663]  We're talking about a system that can tap into, in real time,
[01:18:02.523 --> 01:18:07.208]  In real time, all CCTV cameras across the country.
[01:18:08.109 --> 01:18:11.513]  State and regional cybersecurity enhancement program.
[01:18:11.794 --> 01:18:20.764]  This again is to ensure that the local officials such as your sheriff, your state senator, your congressional representative are under their thumb.
[01:18:21.994 --> 01:18:25.037]  And remember, they're going after all infrastructure.
[01:18:25.057 --> 01:18:32.843]  They say all the important infrastructure, and then they reveal themselves in the bill that they will be giving grants to businesses of a hundred people or less.
[01:18:33.684 --> 01:18:34.725]  That's everybody.
[01:18:35.465 --> 01:18:36.286]  All infrastructures.
[01:18:37.127 --> 01:18:40.570]  NIST Standards of Development and Compliance.
[01:18:40.670 --> 01:18:49.077]  You will comply with the criminal organization that the National Institute of Standards and Technologies has proven itself to be.
[01:18:50.126 --> 01:18:59.468]  Again, NIST is behind the cover-up of what happened at World Trade Center 1, 2, and 7, 8 plus years later.
[01:18:59.488 --> 01:19:01.389]  Yeah, let's give more power to NIST.
[01:19:03.609 --> 01:19:06.070]  Secure Domain Name Addressing System.
[01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:13.532]  This is to ensure that all the major universities and all the major corporations are giving out domain names.
[01:19:13.572 --> 01:19:18.773]  But it gets worse than that because when you put the FCC in control of the Internet,
[01:19:19.867 --> 01:19:26.009]  And you create a mandatory licensing system, they get to say, you know what, we don't like InfoWars.com.
[01:19:26.189 --> 01:19:33.091]  We don't think Alex Jones and PrisonPlanet.TV should be broadcast across the country, across the world.
[01:19:33.931 --> 01:19:37.632]  We don't like that they're reading actual bills to the people.
[01:19:39.059 --> 01:19:40.280]  So you can read this bill.
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:41.540]  It's out there.
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:42.421]  We're going to come back.
[01:19:42.461 --> 01:19:43.842]  We're going to go through even more of it.
[01:19:44.262 --> 01:19:45.202]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:45.322 --> 01:19:46.443]  I'm Jason Bermes sitting in.
[01:19:46.463 --> 01:19:50.945]  Go check us out over at Infowars.com and get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[01:19:51.185 --> 01:19:51.606]  $5.95 a month.
[01:19:51.626 --> 01:19:52.126]  Are you kidding me?
[01:19:59.250 --> 01:20:01.351]  A revolution in smoking is underway.
[01:20:01.671 --> 01:20:05.152]  A revolution all smokers of traditional cigarettes should know about.
[01:20:05.532 --> 01:20:08.793]  Keep listening for a special offer from PowerVapor.com.
[01:20:09.133 --> 01:20:12.894]  Standard tobacco cigarettes contain over 4,000 harmful chemicals.
[01:20:13.134 --> 01:20:17.295]  Now it's time to release yourself from the grip of big tobacco and experience
[01:20:17.335 --> 01:20:18.976]  It's true smoking freedom.
[01:20:19.216 --> 01:20:28.059]  PowerVapor.com is an e-cigarette with the look, feel and smoke of a real cigarette, but with no tar, no carbon monoxide and no bad odors.
[01:20:28.399 --> 01:20:35.001]  PowerVapor's e-cigarettes deliver just the right amount of nicotine in a water vapor that looks and feels like real smoke.
[01:20:35.321 --> 01:20:37.522]  Yes, you choose from four levels of nicotine
[01:20:37.862 --> 01:20:39.664]  And that puts you back in control.
[01:20:39.965 --> 01:20:43.408]  Plus you'll enjoy eight flavors and big savings over traditional cigarettes.

[01:20:56.663 --> 01:20:58.846]  The smoking gun heard round the world.
[01:20:59.497 --> 01:20:59.837]  Good day.
[01:20:59.977 --> 01:21:01.838]  Peter Kronschnabel from Midas Resources.
[01:21:01.899 --> 01:21:03.980]  Today is Thursday, March 4th, 2010.
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:05.321]  Gold open this morning at 1140.20.
[01:21:05.361 --> 01:21:09.103]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for 1171.16, 585.58 for a half ounce, and 292.79 for a quarter ounce.
[01:21:09.123 --> 01:21:09.323]  1171.16, 585.58, and 292.79.
[01:21:19.449 --> 01:21:29.759]  On June 4th, 1963, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[01:21:29.899 --> 01:21:33.002]  With a stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[01:21:33.102 --> 01:21:36.405]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[01:21:36.485 --> 01:21:39.248]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[01:21:39.448 --> 01:21:42.130]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[01:21:42.190 --> 01:21:44.953]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:45.153 --> 01:21:47.315]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[01:21:47.455 --> 01:21:50.138]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:50.338 --> 01:21:54.021]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:54.041 --> 01:21:54.221]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:00.902 --> 01:22:04.549]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:22:04.929 --> 01:22:07.955]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:22:08.175 --> 01:22:09.598]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:22:10.299 --> 01:22:12.960]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:19.182]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:22:19.362 --> 01:22:24.384]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:22:24.904 --> 01:22:34.528]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:22:34.648 --> 01:22:36.770]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:22:36.990 --> 01:22:38.331]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:22:38.592 --> 01:22:40.873]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:22:41.054 --> 01:22:42.895]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:22:43.175 --> 01:22:47.940]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:57.448]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:23:00.692 --> 01:23:03.834]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[01:23:04.075 --> 01:23:12.100]  I designed our top selling holster, the Super Tuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched and gouged while carrying concealed.
[01:23:12.241 --> 01:23:15.623]  The Super Tuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable
[01:23:15.843 --> 01:23:30.134]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:23:30.294 --> 01:23:34.697]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:23:34.857 --> 01:23:40.601]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:23:40.681 --> 01:23:44.004]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:23:44.304 --> 01:23:46.908]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:49.171 --> 01:23:51.935]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:23:52.075 --> 01:23:52.315]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:52.375 --> 01:23:53.717]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:24:15.279 --> 01:24:16.880]  We are back at the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:19.201]  I am Jason Burma, sitting in for just this segment.
[01:24:19.301 --> 01:24:21.062]  Alex, to join us in just a moment.
[01:24:22.183 --> 01:24:25.945]  Now, I was talking earlier about the Cybersecurity Advisory Panel.
[01:24:26.625 --> 01:24:28.126]  What will this be constructed of?
[01:24:28.186 --> 01:24:30.768]  Who will be advising cybersecurity?
[01:24:31.008 --> 01:24:33.609]  They shall appoint, as members, again, not elected.
[01:24:34.109 --> 01:24:40.413]  We're not electing who's going to be in charge of the Internet, the last bastion of freedom in this country and the world.
[01:24:40.633 --> 01:24:41.714]  They'll be appointed.
[01:24:41.734 --> 01:24:43.635]  Because that's how we roll in America now.
[01:24:44.744 --> 01:24:47.606]  Shall appoint as members of panel representatives of industry.
[01:24:47.946 --> 01:24:50.247]  Oh, maybe Mr. Rockefeller will sit on the board.
[01:24:50.447 --> 01:24:50.848]  David!
[01:24:51.728 --> 01:24:53.849]  Academic, non-profit organizations.
[01:24:53.929 --> 01:24:58.532]  Again, they prop up these non-profit organizations with all this funding.
[01:24:59.432 --> 01:25:04.135]  Then they're able, again, if they get caught doing something bad, they just blame that one organization.
[01:25:04.175 --> 01:25:05.456]  It's all compartmentalized.
[01:25:06.804 --> 01:25:09.766]  Interest groups and advocacy organizations.
[01:25:10.546 --> 01:25:18.171]  They're literally telling you that the special interest groups, the industrialists, the globalists will run the cyber security panel.
[01:25:18.351 --> 01:25:19.352]  They will be appointed.
[01:25:20.573 --> 01:25:22.674]  No due process whatsoever for these people.
[01:25:22.834 --> 01:25:23.875]  They haven't robbed you enough.
[01:25:25.731 --> 01:25:28.573]  Let's see, this is at the state and local level as well.
[01:25:28.973 --> 01:25:39.378]  As governments who qualify will provide advice and information on cybersecurity research, development, demonstrations, education, technology transfer, commercial application, or societal and civil liberty concerns.
[01:25:39.638 --> 01:25:44.120]  Again, no concerns about the Constitution and Bill of Rights and whether this is legal or not.
[01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:50.243]  They're just going to prop up their little snitches in the mayor's office, in the sheriff's department.
[01:25:51.297 --> 01:25:59.443]  In the state troopers' barracks to rat anybody out who dare question our industrialist leaders on this panel.
[01:26:00.303 --> 01:26:01.484]  This bill is nightmarish.
[01:26:03.145 --> 01:26:04.667]  What are the duties of this panel?
[01:26:04.687 --> 01:26:10.391]  The panel shall advise the President on matters relating to the National Cybersecurity Program and Strategy.
[01:26:11.431 --> 01:26:14.694]  Again, trends and developments in cybersecurity science and research.
[01:26:15.831 --> 01:26:18.653]  Progress made in implementing this strategy.
[01:26:19.414 --> 01:26:20.815]  How do we get the grid in place?
[01:26:21.075 --> 01:26:22.736]  And they tell you how they're going to get the grid in place.
[01:26:22.936 --> 01:26:26.639]  They're going to recruit your children through scholarships.
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:33.345]  And for these scholarships, they will have to do summer internship programs for the federal government.
[01:26:34.886 --> 01:26:40.290]  And they later state that all software, all software will have to be approved by NIST.
[01:26:40.350 --> 01:26:44.373]  If you want to be an IT person, you will have to be certified by the federal government.
[01:26:44.573 --> 01:26:45.174]  Folks, I work
[01:26:46.207 --> 01:26:47.948]  IT on the side every once in a while?
[01:26:48.529 --> 01:26:52.532]  I can assure you I am not endorsed by the federal government.
[01:26:52.552 --> 01:26:53.733]  I can still take apart a computer.
[01:26:54.674 --> 01:26:54.874]  Okay?
[01:26:54.894 --> 01:26:55.715]  I can still fix one.
[01:26:56.115 --> 01:26:57.136]  I can put in a hard drive.
[01:26:57.456 --> 01:26:58.417]  I can fix a motherboard.
[01:26:58.457 --> 01:26:59.398]  I can put some RAM in.
[01:27:00.418 --> 01:27:01.079]  Is that bad?
[01:27:01.279 --> 01:27:04.942]  Will I not be allowed to do this unless the federal government deems it so?
[01:27:04.962 --> 01:27:07.864]  They'll be like, he's a fake contractor.
[01:27:08.145 --> 01:27:09.746]  He's not federally certified.
[01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:18.676]  And there'll be plenty of people who are certified, again, because they are recruiting the youngest, the most impressionable, the brightest minds out there.
[01:27:19.456 --> 01:27:20.457]  K-12.
[01:27:20.477 --> 01:27:24.800]  Alex has talked about in the past, you know, college and high school level students.
[01:27:25.261 --> 01:27:25.501]  No.
[01:27:26.442 --> 01:27:28.423]  We're talking about your fourth grader, your fifth grader.
[01:27:28.683 --> 01:27:33.507]  When I was in school, I basically worked on a glorified word processing machine.
[01:27:33.547 --> 01:27:34.868]  We played Oregon Trail.
[01:27:35.308 --> 01:27:38.831]  These kids are way beyond word processing.
[01:27:38.851 --> 01:27:40.352]  They're going to be into data sheets.
[01:27:41.536 --> 01:27:49.559]  And patterns, and trends, and how to surveil people via CCTV inside their homes.
[01:27:49.599 --> 01:27:50.680]  That's going to come to America.
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:52.540]  It's already in the United Kingdom.
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:28:02.724]  Do you understand that Sinbin families, the supposed worst of the worst folks, it's almost laughable, have to have CCTV cameras in their homes.
[01:28:03.044 --> 01:28:04.765]  And that was reported over a year ago.
[01:28:05.105 --> 01:28:09.367]  They were already in 2,000 homes in the United Kingdom.
[01:28:10.675 --> 01:28:11.376]  Set to go to 20,000.
[01:28:12.477 --> 01:28:17.040]  Also covered in my upcoming film, Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined.
[01:28:17.841 --> 01:28:19.022]  Because this is a global plan.
[01:28:19.042 --> 01:28:21.404]  This is about international regulation as well.
[01:28:21.424 --> 01:28:27.449]  And when we have international regulation of the internet, in places like China, guess what gets censored?
[01:28:27.749 --> 01:28:28.389]  YouTube!
[01:28:29.931 --> 01:28:31.672]  Can you imagine a free internet without YouTube?
[01:28:32.913 --> 01:28:33.714]  Pretty hard to do, huh?
[01:28:34.854 --> 01:28:35.335]  I'd say about
[01:28:37.344 --> 01:28:42.525]  75-80% of the original information and content news is on YouTube.
[01:28:44.846 --> 01:28:46.266]  So let's censor that.
[01:28:46.406 --> 01:28:47.627]  Let's be China.
[01:28:48.387 --> 01:28:49.667]  Let's have slave communities.
[01:28:49.727 --> 01:28:51.868]  Let's be guilty until proven innocent.
[01:28:52.468 --> 01:28:53.988]  Let's have military on the streets.
[01:28:54.028 --> 01:28:55.428]  Let's have one-child policies.
[01:28:55.909 --> 01:28:57.909]  And these are the UN policies!
[01:29:00.810 --> 01:29:01.890]  Let's just keep going over the bill.
[01:29:03.069 --> 01:29:11.752]  They will be making loans on a selective short-term basis of items advanced in cybersecurity measures to small businesses with less than 100 employees.
[01:29:12.032 --> 01:29:15.253]  And this is that private sector control I'm talking about.
[01:29:15.613 --> 01:29:22.975]  They're already going to go after all the big corporations, the big facilities, and the largest of the large will sit on the board of the cybersecurity panel.
[01:29:23.715 --> 01:29:24.935]  As appointed gods.
[01:29:24.955 --> 01:29:28.796]  We're going to come back, do one more segment on the cyber security bill.
[01:29:28.816 --> 01:29:31.057]  I'm Jason Burma, sitting in for Alex Jones, just this segment.
[01:29:31.217 --> 01:29:32.197]  He'll be back after this.
[01:29:32.277 --> 01:29:34.538]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:29:49.282 --> 01:29:50.182]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.662 --> 01:29:52.163]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.198 --> 01:29:55.939]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:05.182]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:30:05.302 --> 01:30:07.282]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:30:07.402 --> 01:30:09.523]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:30:09.643 --> 01:30:11.144]  And it's available right now to you.

[01:31:58.134 --> 01:32:00.855]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.
[01:32:01.155 --> 01:32:06.918]  Well, here's an unbelievable chance for you to jumpstart your food savings plan from efoodsdirect.com.
[01:32:07.178 --> 01:32:15.022]  Anyone placing food orders on the large volume production run scheduled for the week of March 22nd can get a lot of food for very little cost.
[01:32:15.442 --> 01:32:21.568]  For example, with each pre-production order of three seven-day responders, they'll ship a fourth week of food free.
[01:32:21.808 --> 01:32:23.790]  That's buy three, get one free.
[01:32:23.971 --> 01:32:26.693]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[01:32:26.893 --> 01:32:34.441]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you in this buy three, get one free program.
[01:32:34.861 --> 01:32:37.722]  Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see.
[01:32:37.742 --> 01:32:38.963]  Another example?
[01:32:39.183 --> 01:32:42.225]  Buy nine months worth of food and get three months free.
[01:32:42.365 --> 01:32:47.507]  You've got to go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex for the food buy of a lifetime.
[01:32:47.527 --> 01:32:48.287]  Or call 800-409-5633.
[01:32:48.327 --> 01:32:49.388]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex or 800-409-5633.
[01:33:06.371 --> 01:33:15.886]  Alright Jason, I'm going to go to calls and a bunch of other news here in a moment, but now just without breaking it down too much, go through some of the other subsections in the bill.
[01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:31.648]  Software standardization right here because again all software will have to go through the cyber security panel that again is industrialists, globalists, nobody who's actually elected, all appointed.
[01:33:31.668 --> 01:33:36.811]  That's like the SPP, North American Union, private corporations and secret meetings set it all up.
[01:33:37.051 --> 01:33:37.311]  Absolutely.
[01:33:37.331 --> 01:33:38.572]  This is a corporate global government.
[01:33:39.032 --> 01:33:43.535]  Now they're openly saying a bank of the world constitution running the whole planet with carbon taxes.
[01:33:43.655 --> 01:33:46.058]  And for those that don't believe me, let me just read that subsection again.
[01:33:46.298 --> 01:33:47.900]  This is section 3, subsection 1.
[01:33:58.592 --> 01:34:08.955]  Interest groups and advocacy organizations, the very special interest groups that control Congress and the Senate and state and local governments who are qualified to provide advice and information on cybersecurity.
[01:34:09.135 --> 01:34:13.936]  So they'll go to the lowest levels as well because they are also setting up regional cybersecurity.
[01:34:13.956 --> 01:34:22.299]  But the biggest subsection in there is where they go down to IT companies that have a hundred or more customers and they have to put their software in and be run by the federal government.
[01:34:22.319 --> 01:34:24.179]  I mean, this is just totally taking over everything.
[01:34:24.399 --> 01:34:24.900]  Absolutely.
[01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:37.410]  When the FCC takes over with their national broadband plan right here in section 6, subsection 2, we'll all need mandatory licensing beginning in the next three years to be on the internet.
[01:34:37.610 --> 01:34:40.973]  I wonder if they're going to allow InfoWars.com and PrisonPlan.tv?
[01:34:40.994 --> 01:34:45.618]  Well, that's what the New York Times and the White House and all of them called for is internet licensing to even get online.
[01:34:45.898 --> 01:34:46.398]  Absolutely.
[01:34:47.159 --> 01:34:49.802]  As they train your children, as they go through,
[01:34:50.954 --> 01:34:55.799]  And K-12 students for participation in summer work and internship programs.
[01:34:56.260 --> 01:35:00.504]  Why would a kindergartner be in a summer program with the federal government?
[01:35:00.925 --> 01:35:02.166]  It's absolutely obscene.
[01:35:02.226 --> 01:35:04.188]  It's absolutely absurd.
[01:35:04.528 --> 01:35:05.890]  But they want the best in price.
[01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:08.332]  They want to control it top to bottom.
[01:35:09.232 --> 01:35:21.476]  The top, of course, being the appointed members of industry, of the banks, of the special interest groups, and then at the very bottom, the slave class children that will be trained to run this grid.
[01:35:22.076 --> 01:35:26.998]  And let's not forget, these aren't just... Yeah, they're shifting the economy over where there's billions of dollars of funding a year.
[01:35:28.587 --> 01:35:33.369]  Literally designing and engineering our economy, where that's the job people can get.
[01:35:33.429 --> 01:35:34.589]  That's the scholarships they can get.
[01:35:34.729 --> 01:35:45.833]  And you predicted this back in 2003 or 2002, I can't remember the video, but if you can find the Alex Jones SeaWorld video, he literally goes into the back room and starts typing on the computers and telling people, that's how it's going to be.
[01:35:45.853 --> 01:35:49.634]  You're going to be trained to sit at your desk and watch a computer and tattletale on people.
[01:35:49.654 --> 01:35:50.434]  Well, no, they said that.
[01:35:50.514 --> 01:35:51.395]  That's why I knew.
[01:35:51.575 --> 01:35:51.775]  Yeah.
[01:35:52.235 --> 01:35:54.636]  They said the jobs will be watching each other.
[01:35:55.296 --> 01:35:57.078]  And that's what this bill is about.
[01:35:57.358 --> 01:35:59.279]  And it's not just about the United States.
[01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:00.561]  International standards.
[01:36:00.581 --> 01:36:01.982]  And we know how the Internet is run.
[01:36:02.002 --> 01:36:08.387]  Well, last year they had control of the Internet domain system and address system to the UN.
[01:36:08.587 --> 01:36:09.028]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:36:09.068 --> 01:36:10.609]  I forget what the organization called it.
[01:36:10.629 --> 01:36:10.749]  ICANN.
[01:36:10.889 --> 01:36:11.670]  That's right, ICANN.
[01:36:11.690 --> 01:36:19.357]  And they threw a big fit about that, but the national media says, don't worry, just drink your mercury-laced water.
[01:36:19.837 --> 01:36:20.718]  Alright, hit the last points.
[01:36:22.955 --> 01:36:25.857]  Again, the government is taking over the entire internet.
[01:36:25.877 --> 01:36:28.819]  They're putting it under FCC and NIST control.
[01:36:28.879 --> 01:36:33.262]  NIST will tell you how the software can be configured.
[01:36:33.282 --> 01:36:35.144]  They will tell you what you can run on your computers.
[01:36:35.164 --> 01:36:36.444]  This is for private sector.
[01:36:36.945 --> 01:36:42.969]  Private sector, public sector, in the smallest regions, in the smallest of towns.
[01:36:43.009 --> 01:36:44.130]  They're going after you.
[01:36:44.410 --> 01:36:46.591]  It says so in this bill.
[01:36:47.392 --> 01:36:48.132]  Think about that.
[01:36:48.192 --> 01:36:50.393]  Why would they need regional cyber security?
[01:36:50.433 --> 01:36:54.414]  Why would they need to go after organizations with less than 100 employees?
[01:36:54.514 --> 01:36:57.735]  Why is the critical infrastructure also privatized?
[01:36:57.895 --> 01:36:59.416]  Why is the FCC stepping in?
[01:36:59.996 --> 01:37:06.578]  Again, the internet is the last bastion of freedom and the FCC has ruined television, they've ruined regular radio, and they will ruin the internet.
[01:37:07.238 --> 01:37:07.939]  This is it, Alex.
[01:37:10.225 --> 01:37:14.388]  I pray to God that this bill, A, doesn't get worse in the Senate, and B, pass the Senate.
[01:37:14.429 --> 01:37:15.529]  People need to wake up.
[01:37:15.970 --> 01:37:20.874]  Because my liberal friends sit there and they ninny and say, oh, we need cybersecurity.
[01:37:20.954 --> 01:37:22.635]  And it's all in the program.
[01:37:22.675 --> 01:37:35.606]  We have Michael Chertoff and others on CNN with this big cybersecurity act where they literally say, at one point, the National Guard is coming in for martial law, and if the governors don't like that it's under federal control, too bad.
[01:37:35.626 --> 01:37:36.547]  And then they laughed about it.
[01:37:36.747 --> 01:37:37.487]  They're like, too bad!
[01:37:38.456 --> 01:37:39.497]  Literally talking about?
[01:37:39.757 --> 01:37:47.242]  Well, that's because the banks are coming in with their swindle takeover and they've got to suppress free speech so they can get away with all the crimes they're committing.
[01:37:47.282 --> 01:38:00.030]  It's like the ATF shutting down gun shows without a law, raiding toy stores and taking their toy, not even real BB guns, and having no law and saying we don't care, spying on us without warrants.
[01:38:00.050 --> 01:38:02.031]  I mean, this is happening.
[01:38:02.071 --> 01:38:03.572]  Burmas, I'm going to move on to calls.
[01:38:03.592 --> 01:38:05.133]  Go ahead and finish some of the last subsections.
[01:38:06.664 --> 01:38:07.125]  Let's see.
[01:38:07.867 --> 01:38:10.454]  I just really want to hit on this one subsection again.
[01:38:11.337 --> 01:38:11.677]  Section 12.
[01:38:12.278 --> 01:38:13.619]  There's a bunch of other subsections.
[01:38:14.179 --> 01:38:18.081]  I just want to go over this cyber scholarship program because it's so important, Alex.
[01:38:18.322 --> 01:38:22.864]  The director of the National Science Foundation shall establish a federal cyber scholarship for service program.
[01:38:22.884 --> 01:38:23.905]  And it's going to sound real nice.
[01:38:24.345 --> 01:38:28.888]  Your kid is going to come home with that letter and they'll say, he's a junior computer genius.
[01:38:28.928 --> 01:38:31.130]  We want to have him for our summer program.
[01:38:31.170 --> 01:38:32.331]  We want to even give you money.
[01:38:32.631 --> 01:38:35.773]  And then they indoctrinate your child to spy on you.
[01:38:35.793 --> 01:38:37.454]  This is Homeland Security CIA.
[01:38:37.894 --> 01:38:38.434]  Go to the next one.
[01:38:39.495 --> 01:38:40.516]  Let's see what we got here.
[01:38:42.571 --> 01:38:46.354]  Because I read it about a month ago on air and there's a lot of other key subsections there at the end.
[01:38:46.374 --> 01:38:47.895]  They talk about giving prizes.
[01:38:48.555 --> 01:38:48.935]  Prizes.
[01:38:48.955 --> 01:38:52.398]  Remember the cash prizes for CCTV cameras in the United Kingdom?
[01:38:52.658 --> 01:38:56.241]  How they're going to spy on criminals and people are going to watch random CCTV cameras.
[01:38:56.321 --> 01:38:56.901]  It's right here.
[01:38:57.122 --> 01:39:02.806]  Prizes under this section may consist of federal appropriated funds and funds by the private sector for such cash prizes.
[01:39:02.846 --> 01:39:04.107]  So they're making it a reward system.
[01:39:04.127 --> 01:39:09.371]  Well that's like the IRS now paying people to spy on their neighbors and inside businesses and just make stuff up.
[01:39:09.391 --> 01:39:10.972]  We're turning into the total snitch society.
[01:39:11.332 --> 01:39:13.173]  Absolutely, and there's a bunch of collusion in here.
[01:39:13.794 --> 01:39:17.296]  Basically, administering the competition regulates the competition.
[01:39:17.376 --> 01:39:21.739]  It will be even worse than the two giants, Microsoft and Macintosh.
[01:39:21.819 --> 01:39:25.622]  No one will be able to get into the game of writing software, Alex.
[01:39:25.662 --> 01:39:27.383]  There will be no other operating systems.
[01:39:27.563 --> 01:39:31.185]  And all the operating systems will be approved by the federal government.
[01:39:31.205 --> 01:39:37.269]  We already know there are so many backdoors in Windows Vista, the new Windows 7.
[01:39:37.469 --> 01:39:39.751]  We know Google is working with the NSA.
[01:39:39.931 --> 01:39:43.413]  Obviously Apple is a front for intelligence with their iPhone.
[01:39:43.433 --> 01:39:43.974]  The iPhone...
[01:39:44.654 --> 01:39:47.156]  It was revealed, I believe, six months ago, Alex.
[01:39:47.536 --> 01:39:53.961]  Every time one of those boxes collapses, it takes a picture with your camera and stores it in a temporary folder that then can be accessed.
[01:39:54.401 --> 01:40:09.352]  And this is really all just an extension of what we saw in the 90s with Echelon and Carnivore and these other type of track, trace, and database programs that would look for keywords and then basically database you.
[01:40:09.693 --> 01:40:10.754]  Put you into a system.
[01:40:11.767 --> 01:40:12.888]  Try to profile you.
[01:40:13.288 --> 01:40:14.368]  And this is the next extension.
[01:40:14.388 --> 01:40:27.674]  A lot of people don't understand, under the Bush administration, outside of the warrantless wiretaps, we had them admitting that they were tracking, tracing, and databasing everything we do on a computer, from IMs, to emails, to talking on our cell phones.
[01:40:27.734 --> 01:40:28.255]  Absolutely.
[01:40:28.295 --> 01:40:29.415]  Burmese, thanks for coming in with that.
[01:40:29.435 --> 01:40:32.256]  There's even a lot more in there, and Kurt and Emma and Paul Watson have written articles about it.
[01:40:32.296 --> 01:40:32.637]  Thank you.
[01:40:32.717 --> 01:40:33.037]  Thank you.
[01:40:33.057 --> 01:40:34.598]  Appreciate you spending time with us.
[01:40:35.058 --> 01:40:36.638]  Okay, here's what I want to do.
[01:40:36.779 --> 01:40:37.319]  I want to go to
[01:40:38.621 --> 01:40:44.807]  Rikita, Dalton, Kelly, Tom, Ben, and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:40:45.347 --> 01:40:47.129]  We're taking first-time calls a day.
[01:40:47.289 --> 01:40:51.213]  I do that every few weeks so people that can never get in have a chance to be heard on air.
[01:40:51.233 --> 01:40:51.713]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:40:51.733 --> 01:40:54.396]  And then I want to get into several key stacks of news.
[01:41:02.278 --> 01:41:10.020]  That I have here in front of me that I haven't even gotten into yet, and I want to plow back through an article that I started talking about, but it's so important I'm going to get back into it.
[01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:14.141]  Coffee Party founder is Obama campaign operative.
[01:41:14.261 --> 01:41:31.905]  See, two months ago we had the idea to start a coffee party to wake up the Tea Party that they're being taken over by mainline Republicans who don't want to audit the Federal Reserve, that don't want to repeal unconstitutional gun laws, that are pro-Patriot Act and police state.
[01:41:34.448 --> 01:41:36.809]  But they're posing as patriots, so it'd be the coffee party.
[01:41:36.849 --> 01:41:39.451]  Well, Obama has now created one to be pro-government.
[01:41:40.372 --> 01:41:41.312]  Pro-corrupt government.
[01:41:42.473 --> 01:41:49.317]  And this is another one of his initiatives to try to get all these fake community organizations out there working for him and spying on American citizens.
[01:41:49.337 --> 01:41:54.320]  Remember when they said, report fishy neighbors, or people that criticize the government, to the White House.
[01:41:55.141 --> 01:41:57.022]  So, that is coming up as well.
[01:41:57.062 --> 01:42:00.624]  But right now, I want to go ahead and go to some of your phone calls.
[01:42:01.464 --> 01:42:03.506]  Rakita in Maryland, you're on the air.
[01:42:03.546 --> 01:42:03.886]  Go ahead.
[01:42:05.063 --> 01:42:06.124]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[01:42:06.144 --> 01:42:07.445]  I'm well.
[01:42:09.047 --> 01:42:19.457]  Okay, I was just listening to your segment and I was curious to know if you knew if the Nielsen Company had any ties to the government?
[01:42:21.179 --> 01:42:27.945]  Well, I mean, Nielsen gets you to put a tracker box on your cable box or television that tracks what you watch.
[01:42:28.857 --> 01:42:33.958]  But any digital cable box or TiVo tracks what you watch and what you do, and it's two-way.
[01:42:34.518 --> 01:42:36.159]  Just like a computer, it is a computer.
[01:42:36.779 --> 01:42:37.459]  That's admitted.
[01:42:38.459 --> 01:42:42.880]  But I don't particularly know about Nielsen.
[01:42:44.421 --> 01:42:52.803]  I was curious, because I'm currently in Nielsen House, and probably about a week and a half ago,
[01:42:53.615 --> 01:42:53.935]  I don't know.
[01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:11.691]  Yeah, well, that's already going on.
[01:43:11.791 --> 01:43:13.772]  They just want you to openly go along with them.
[01:43:13.832 --> 01:43:19.194]  Google all the major systems, Time Warner, Spy, record everything, sell it to the government.
[01:43:19.875 --> 01:43:20.775]  That's on record.
[01:43:21.835 --> 01:43:28.418]  So they're just wanting you to pay you so that they can publicly use the data.
[01:43:29.399 --> 01:43:32.080]  But this is already going on with your computer.
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:33.601]  It's already going on with digital cable box.
[01:43:33.621 --> 01:43:35.842]  It's already going on with all cell phones under federal law.
[01:43:36.482 --> 01:43:38.583]  Everything is a tracking grip.
[01:43:41.724 --> 01:43:49.869]  Oh wow, so even if I didn't agree to it, there's someone tracking the pages I'm going to anyway.
[01:43:50.450 --> 01:43:51.731]  Yes, I appreciate your call.
[01:43:52.171 --> 01:44:05.880]  Now about 10 years ago, separate companies from Arbitron that tracks radio, similar to Nielsen, a AM or FM receiver in a car or in your home or on a boat or wherever it is,
[01:44:07.227 --> 01:44:11.088]  It doesn't just receive, it transmits at a much lower level.
[01:44:11.408 --> 01:44:14.328]  Part of the receiving is a micro-transmitting.
[01:44:15.269 --> 01:44:24.551]  And so they started putting in billboards all over the country that would, as cars drove by, be able to scan what frequency they were listening to.
[01:44:24.571 --> 01:44:30.832]  And if you've noticed with digital frequencies now in your car, it'll tell you what station you're listening to, even what song's on.
[01:44:31.312 --> 01:44:35.513]  Because out over the carrier of the AM or FM,
[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:46.905]  They're also sending out a data information stream that tells your AM FM radio in your car, even the cheapest ones, exactly what you're doing.
[01:44:47.845 --> 01:44:53.568]  They're also moving towards people meters like a Nielsen box in the cars and that's being phased in.
[01:44:53.628 --> 01:44:54.789]  It's already in most the country.
[01:44:55.969 --> 01:44:59.431]  But this is just where they admit they're doing this and where you opt in.
[01:44:59.991 --> 01:45:02.773]  Google four years ago said they're using cameras and microphones.
[01:45:03.519 --> 01:45:05.740]  On over 150 million computers in the U.S.
[01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:07.361]  to listen to everything you're doing in your house.
[01:45:08.202 --> 01:45:11.123]  And people thought when I was reading their own press release I was making that up.
[01:45:12.324 --> 01:45:19.928]  I had people at the local radio station where I was doing the Sunday show out of, at the time, would make jokes when I walked down the hall.
[01:45:20.249 --> 01:45:23.050]  Oh, they're watching me on the camera on my computer.
[01:45:23.471 --> 01:45:24.851]  You know, that's up at the top of the screen.
[01:45:26.352 --> 01:45:27.733]  Oh, they're listening to me, Alex.
[01:45:27.813 --> 01:45:28.894]  Are they going to get me?
[01:45:29.921 --> 01:45:35.682]  I'd tell people 14 years ago that digital cable boxes were tracking everything you did, because I had the manuals that were sent to me.
[01:45:36.783 --> 01:45:40.584]  In one case of the Atlantic Scientific or Scientific Atlantic box.
[01:45:40.644 --> 01:45:41.504]  Now it's all admitted.
[01:45:42.244 --> 01:45:46.585]  And now, oh, the schools are watching the children when they go home with their government-issued laptops.
[01:45:47.565 --> 01:45:49.506]  So this is a total control grid.
[01:45:50.186 --> 01:45:52.186]  And it's the same thing with all the new cell phones.
[01:45:52.666 --> 01:45:54.867]  So people are like, well, then why do you have a free iPhone app?
[01:45:54.907 --> 01:45:55.987]  Why do you have a cell phone?
[01:45:56.367 --> 01:45:58.988]  Well, I mean, we're using the matrix to get people out of the matrix.
[01:45:59.909 --> 01:46:06.634]  I mean, it'd be stupid if I just said I was going to be Amish and move out in the middle of nowhere and just scream from the top of a mountain.
[01:46:07.295 --> 01:46:09.936]  I'm in the grid telling you about the grid.
[01:46:11.858 --> 01:46:14.060]  But let's continue with phone calls.
[01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:15.040]  That was a really good question.
[01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:16.341]  Dalton in Detroit.
[01:46:16.361 --> 01:46:17.342]  You're on the air, Dalton.
[01:46:18.243 --> 01:46:21.805]  Hey Alex, I want to thank you for helping this country and changing my life.
[01:46:22.606 --> 01:46:23.266]  Thank you.
[01:46:24.770 --> 01:46:33.436]  One quick statement, I think that the IRS plane crash with Mr. Stack was not an inside job, because I think if it was, the government would be still playing it up every single day.
[01:46:33.817 --> 01:46:36.739]  Well, they have been playing it up on quite a few channels, but go ahead.
[01:46:37.739 --> 01:46:44.965]  Second thing, how much validity do you lay in the heist with your own Greens fan Robert Rubin, Larry Summers over at Fort Knox?
[01:46:47.894 --> 01:46:52.096]  You know, there's always stories, Dalton, that can't be confirmed.
[01:46:52.116 --> 01:46:54.057]  That, oh, Karl Rove was arrested in Europe.
[01:46:54.157 --> 01:46:54.738]  Not true.
[01:46:55.058 --> 01:46:59.580]  Then you learn the sources of media that always put out this info after a few times doing it.
[01:47:00.781 --> 01:47:03.782]  It's kind of like the hoax of the Amaro coin that was just a...
[01:47:05.706 --> 01:47:08.808]  Memorabilia made as a joke by a small coin manufacturer.
[01:47:09.268 --> 01:47:11.750]  And we said day one, here's who makes it, it's not real.
[01:47:11.950 --> 01:47:13.511]  People still don't know the truth.
[01:47:13.911 --> 01:47:15.212]  Even though we've told them a hundred times.
[01:47:15.652 --> 01:47:16.713]  Probably more than a hundred times.
[01:47:18.334 --> 01:47:22.277]  As for the IMF and World Bank and the Federal Reserve selling
[01:47:23.775 --> 01:47:27.096]  Gold-plated tungsten that has a similar weight to gold.
[01:47:27.736 --> 01:47:29.637]  I have seen no evidence of that.
[01:47:29.657 --> 01:47:36.820]  I mean, it doesn't mean it's not true, but you would have heard countries and governments and corporations buying this gold, screaming, bloody murder.
[01:47:37.220 --> 01:47:38.120]  I appreciate your call.
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:39.580]  Kelly in Indiana, you're on the air.
[01:47:42.421 --> 01:47:43.762]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:47:45.563 --> 01:47:45.983]  Two things.
[01:47:46.203 --> 01:47:50.164]  I love your delivery, I love the way you give the news, and I love how you're passionate about what you do.
[01:47:53.146 --> 01:47:57.113]  I'd also just like to say that knowledge is power.
[01:47:57.694 --> 01:47:59.597]  You should learn how to garden.
[01:47:59.718 --> 01:48:01.360]  Make sure you can filter your own water.
[01:48:01.881 --> 01:48:02.723]  Get your own food.
[01:48:02.743 --> 01:48:04.606]  Do what you gotta do to live.
[01:48:05.027 --> 01:48:05.407]  Thanks, man.
[01:48:06.246 --> 01:48:07.247]  I appreciate your call.
[01:48:07.787 --> 01:48:12.590]  It is important to become self-sufficient and at least not be completely dependent on the government.
[01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:24.376]  Everything the system is setting up, from the food production, to water, to energy, to the way the cities are laid out, is to control you and literally turn the whole country and world into a prison.
[01:48:24.396 --> 01:48:25.457]  And the Pentagon admits that.
[01:48:26.377 --> 01:48:31.020]  We've played UN clips here on air where they're openly talking about it.
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:34.181]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tom in Texas.
[01:48:34.221 --> 01:48:34.962]  Tom, you're on the air.
[01:48:36.409 --> 01:48:36.789]  Thank you.
[01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:38.210]  First time caller.
[01:48:38.511 --> 01:48:39.531]  Been listening for a while.
[01:48:41.953 --> 01:48:48.217]  I guess I just have one question, Alex, and I'm not trying to be a rabble rouser or anything, but I'm pretty well fed up at this point.
[01:48:49.998 --> 01:48:52.420]  When do we start to stop this?
[01:48:52.660 --> 01:49:00.005]  And I mean, seriously, I don't think that we're going to have legitimate elections
[01:49:01.297 --> 01:49:01.537]  Wow.
[01:49:19.312 --> 01:49:23.336]  And the government is building giant paramilitary armies against the people.
[01:49:23.356 --> 01:49:32.303]  I mean, there's no doubt we're in trouble, but we are having a lot of success in waking people up, and we're having victories at the state level.
[01:49:33.044 --> 01:49:34.625]  We're having victories in Congress.
[01:49:34.645 --> 01:49:38.768]  We're defeating their health care bill, their climate takeover bill, their carbon tax.
[01:49:39.229 --> 01:49:40.650]  We exposed their swine flu.
[01:49:41.430 --> 01:49:44.193]  The Wall Street Journal says, you know, the swine flu that fizzled.
[01:49:44.793 --> 01:49:53.456]  Record numbers of people didn't take it, or the regular seasonal flu, and so we have a record low flu, because the flu shot, as studies show, is giving people the flu.
[01:49:54.376 --> 01:49:55.556]  We're having so many victories.
[01:49:55.576 --> 01:49:56.697]  We're also having defeats.
[01:49:59.318 --> 01:50:02.459]  But people talk about physically stopping it.
[01:50:02.479 --> 01:50:03.399]  I mean, what do you do?
[01:50:03.459 --> 01:50:09.221]  I mean, I'm asking you that question, Tom.
[01:50:09.261 --> 01:50:10.461]  I mean, what do you physically do?
[01:50:11.261 --> 01:50:12.262]  What do I physically do?
[01:50:13.641 --> 01:50:14.641]  I'm a former Marine.
[01:50:14.721 --> 01:50:18.202]  I've been out for quite some time, and we were taught to adapt and overcome.
[01:50:18.262 --> 01:50:29.206]  We adapt, and we need to start adapting now in a physical sense, not just going on the internet or listening to shortwave or things of that nature.
[01:50:29.246 --> 01:50:32.547]  You need to physically adapt.
[01:50:33.087 --> 01:50:34.587]  Well, Tom, stay there.
[01:50:34.667 --> 01:50:35.808]  Tom, we've got a break.
[01:50:35.868 --> 01:50:36.208]  Stay there.
[01:50:36.248 --> 01:50:36.728]  Don't hang up.
[01:50:37.861 --> 01:50:43.665]  Let's come back and talk about versus just listening to the radio or surfing the internet or passing videos around.
[01:50:44.906 --> 01:50:48.729]  What do we do physically that doesn't hurt anybody?
[01:50:49.149 --> 01:50:52.291]  And so I've got some ideas on the other side.
[01:50:52.371 --> 01:50:52.751]  Stay with us.
[01:50:52.771 --> 01:50:53.332]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:58.911 --> 01:51:02.114]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:51:02.474 --> 01:51:04.295]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:51:04.756 --> 01:51:05.176]  Don't!
[01:51:05.637 --> 01:51:08.659]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:51:09.059 --> 01:51:17.847]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb Kay's number one debt secret.
[01:51:18.167 --> 01:51:21.830]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[01:51:22.230 --> 01:51:24.952]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[01:51:25.372 --> 01:51:32.397]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:51:32.738 --> 01:51:33.718]  Herb K. was right.
[01:51:33.918 --> 01:51:36.981]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:51:37.101 --> 01:51:38.121]  What have you got to lose?
[01:51:38.462 --> 01:51:41.644]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[01:51:42.184 --> 01:51:42.785]  Get Herb K.'
[01:51:42.705 --> 01:51:45.847]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[01:51:46.107 --> 01:51:46.407]  Call 888-352-7726.
[01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:50.950]  That's 888-352-7726.
[01:51:50.970 --> 01:51:51.010]  888-352-7726.
[01:51:51.030 --> 01:51:53.851]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:51:53.891 --> 01:51:56.432]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:51:56.452 --> 01:52:00.333]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:52:09.494 --> 01:52:12.177]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:52:12.197 --> 01:52:18.423]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:52:18.563 --> 01:52:23.587]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:52:24.108 --> 01:52:33.757]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:52:33.857 --> 01:52:35.958]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:52:36.199 --> 01:52:37.539]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:52:37.780 --> 01:52:40.061]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:52:40.241 --> 01:52:42.083]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:52:42.363 --> 01:52:47.206]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:52:47.526 --> 01:52:52.289]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:52:59.509 --> 01:53:05.812]  Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[01:53:06.193 --> 01:53:12.316]  Because alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:53:12.596 --> 01:53:18.599]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[01:53:18.919 --> 01:53:23.822]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[01:53:24.302 --> 01:53:32.172]  Using AlkaVision pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[01:53:32.493 --> 01:53:36.638]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to an alkaline level.
[01:53:37.078 --> 01:53:40.803]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[01:53:41.744 --> 01:53:47.285]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.

[01:53:50.506 --> 01:53:51.166]  Or by calling 269-409-1776.
[01:53:51.186 --> 01:53:51.346]  269-409-1776 today.
[01:53:51.386 --> 01:53:55.746]  For more than 15 years before the war against the British kicked off in 1775, and officially kicked off July 4th, 1776,
[01:54:13.234 --> 01:54:20.140]  As much as FEMA and the media demonized the Founding Fathers, that's what July 4th is, that's what this country was founded on, was standing up against tyrants.
[01:54:20.700 --> 01:54:26.485]  The founders didn't go out and get violent until the paramilitary police came to confiscate their guns.
[01:54:27.806 --> 01:54:32.490]  And if the government tries more WACOs, it will probably kick off a civil war.
[01:54:33.511 --> 01:54:34.492]  And then all of these
[01:54:35.692 --> 01:54:40.819]  A feminine, tough guy, police and paramilitary with all their toys are in deep trouble.
[01:54:41.620 --> 01:54:43.102]  But I don't... it's some macho...
[01:54:44.721 --> 01:54:46.922]  Point in my psyche, want this.
[01:54:47.743 --> 01:54:50.164]  Okay, I'm here trying to wake people up.
[01:54:50.184 --> 01:54:51.684]  I know the pen is mightier than the sword.
[01:54:51.704 --> 01:55:00.849]  We're having a big effect, but there's a lot we can do short of violence, shibble disobedience, or legal banner hangs, or flyers.
[01:55:01.329 --> 01:55:06.212]  I mean, if enough people in every city file lawsuits, go to city council every week,
[01:55:07.299 --> 01:55:09.640]  Educate the public about what they put in the water supply.
[01:55:09.660 --> 01:55:11.860]  It's not just fluoride, it's hundreds of deadly chemicals.
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:16.041]  If you send people the EPA's own admissions, how it causes bone cancer.
[01:55:17.202 --> 01:55:18.662]  I mean, that's just one issue.
[01:55:19.042 --> 01:55:29.325]  Or if you point out how your cities, in 800 plus cities in the U.S., or sanctuary cities, where illegals can drunk drive, assault people, and don't even go to jail, and don't have to have IDs.
[01:55:29.725 --> 01:55:31.305]  You point out how that's discriminatory.
[01:55:33.386 --> 01:55:36.668]  I'm all for micro FM, as long as it doesn't interfere with commercial stations.
[01:55:37.188 --> 01:55:50.174]  You know, people get the micro transmitters, goes out a few miles, put it up in your neighborhood, put a fly on every door once a month, you'll get a thousand people listening just in a mile circumference around you, if you're in a built-up urban area.
[01:55:50.754 --> 01:55:54.676]  I mean, every person you wake up, every mind you unlock is huge.
[01:55:55.056 --> 01:55:58.138]  The Pentagon says 90% of their operations are psychological.
[01:55:58.498 --> 01:56:02.580]  We need to counter with the truth, which is the most powerful psychological tool out there.
[01:56:03.785 --> 01:56:06.590]  But, you know, you talk about physical...
[01:56:10.202 --> 01:56:11.463]  The system is intimidated.
[01:56:11.503 --> 01:56:12.363]  They are concerned.
[01:56:12.403 --> 01:56:13.724]  They can't get our guns.
[01:56:13.764 --> 01:56:14.425]  They're trying.
[01:56:14.885 --> 01:56:16.366]  They're failing on so many fronts.
[01:56:16.926 --> 01:56:18.647]  I mean, what else do you have to add, Tom?
[01:56:18.687 --> 01:56:30.175]  I mean, if we could get the public that's awake, 25, 30 percent are really awake now, to go to city council, go to the statehouse, run for office, expose the electronic voting machines, get them removed.
[01:56:30.775 --> 01:56:33.157]  I mean, there's so much more we can do.
[01:56:33.637 --> 01:56:35.418]  And, you know, talk about just listening to the radio.
[01:56:35.438 --> 01:56:36.539]  We're not just listening to the radio here.
[01:56:37.139 --> 01:56:43.921]  I mean, I make books, films, materials that are, most of the time I say, what woke you up?
[01:56:43.981 --> 01:56:44.761]  Oh, your films did.
[01:56:44.781 --> 01:56:46.101]  And then they wake up other people.
[01:56:46.562 --> 01:56:49.502]  I mean, we're not just here talking, we're here reaching people.
[01:56:49.522 --> 01:56:52.183]  That's why the media and the government push their stuff over media.
[01:56:52.443 --> 01:56:53.763]  Because this stuff has an effect.
[01:56:54.604 --> 01:56:56.764]  And people tune into this show, they're never the same.
[01:56:57.564 --> 01:56:59.185]  But I mean, what are you getting at, Tom?
[01:57:00.245 --> 01:57:02.926]  What I'm getting at is, you can
[01:57:04.612 --> 01:57:33.094]  You are the one person that we need on the airways, but we ourselves as individuals out here in the country, in the cities, in the towns, in the little burbs, you need to know who your neighbors are, you need to organize, you need to sit down and talk to each other and find out who you can rely on, who you can trust, because when the man comes through the door, he is going to do it at his advantage.
[01:57:34.488 --> 01:57:37.990]  He might stop you on your way home from the grocery store.
[01:57:38.410 --> 01:57:41.431]  And you might go into jail and disappear for a while.
[01:57:41.792 --> 01:57:42.392]  No, it's easy.
[01:57:42.432 --> 01:57:44.413]  I mean, they're tracking everybody's cell phone and live time.
[01:57:44.733 --> 01:57:45.954]  Let's pick Alex Jones up.
[01:57:45.994 --> 01:57:47.114]  He's going to the grocery store.
[01:57:47.594 --> 01:57:48.235]  Absolutely.
[01:57:48.275 --> 01:57:49.795]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[01:57:50.756 --> 01:57:52.136]  You can fall back on.
[01:57:52.537 --> 01:57:54.958]  You can't be an individual out here anymore.
[01:57:56.198 --> 01:57:58.560]  You have to have people in your community.
[01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:01.361]  And I know that there's a lot, a lot of people
[01:58:02.128 --> 01:58:07.551]  In these communities, in Texas, in every state in the United States, and you can get to know your neighbors.
[01:58:07.611 --> 01:58:13.274]  How many people do you know that live three or four or five blocks away from your house?
[01:58:14.055 --> 01:58:17.156]  I bet most people can count them on three fingers.
[01:58:18.617 --> 01:58:23.340]  Usually it's the guy behind you, the guy on the left or the right of you, and the guy directly across the street.
[01:58:24.312 --> 01:58:31.218]  Yeah, because everybody's got to get in there and turn the TV on and let it program them, instead of even knowing their neighbors, we're losing our humanity.
[01:58:31.879 --> 01:58:32.319]  I agree.
[01:58:32.739 --> 01:58:37.063]  Getting to know your neighbors, turning the television off, is the first step in destroying the globalists.
[01:58:40.266 --> 01:58:41.587]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:41.647 --> 01:58:44.389]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:48.806 --> 01:58:54.231]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:58:55.452 --> 01:59:00.236]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:59:00.596 --> 01:59:07.422]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:59:09.324 --> 01:59:11.486]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:59:13.407 --> 01:59:15.369]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:59:17.819 --> 01:59:21.720]  Put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:25.561]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[01:59:26.221 --> 01:59:27.081]  Others don't.
[01:59:27.481 --> 01:59:29.362]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:59:29.622 --> 01:59:31.122]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:59:31.402 --> 01:59:33.963]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:59:34.283 --> 01:59:40.544]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:59:40.904 --> 01:59:43.105]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:59:43.605 --> 01:59:45.646]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[01:59:45.986 --> 01:59:46.846]  Others don't.
[01:59:51.477 --> 01:59:53.420]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:53.881 --> 01:59:56.644]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:04.352 --> 02:00:06.754]  We are now into the final hour.
[02:00:06.774 --> 02:00:09.917]  That Ron Paul interview was so important and only 15 minutes long.
[02:00:09.937 --> 02:00:13.100]  I'm gonna air some parts of it coming up in the last few segments today.
[02:00:13.540 --> 02:00:15.702]  Got a lot of news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[02:00:16.062 --> 02:00:18.965]  We're gonna continue with your phone calls right now.
[02:00:19.485 --> 02:00:20.526]  Ben in Indiana.
[02:00:21.047 --> 02:00:21.647]  You're on the air.
[02:00:21.707 --> 02:00:22.348]  Thanks for holding.
[02:00:24.777 --> 02:00:25.538]  Thanks for getting me on the air.
[02:00:25.738 --> 02:00:29.022]  I just want to say thank you so much for all your work.
[02:00:29.562 --> 02:00:33.787]  Your films woke me up, and I'm getting your films out to other people, and it's waking them up.
[02:00:34.287 --> 02:00:43.637]  I think that's probably the best thing, most effective thing people could do, is get a big stack printer and print tons of Fall of the Republic out, or whichever one of your films, Blues Change, Endgame.
[02:00:43.657 --> 02:00:44.118]  They're all great.
[02:00:45.835 --> 02:00:47.096]  Um, I disagree with the other caller.
[02:00:47.116 --> 02:00:54.282]  I think the, uh, Joe Stack thing does look like it's staged because of damage on the building for one, his intelligence connections.
[02:00:54.903 --> 02:00:59.167]  It's really hard to believe that you had the emergency crews there beforehand.
[02:00:59.227 --> 02:00:59.987]  That's now admitted.
[02:01:00.288 --> 02:01:02.349]  Multiple witnesses saw no one in the plane.
[02:01:03.050 --> 02:01:04.751]  Uh, you've got, it just goes on and on.
[02:01:05.272 --> 02:01:09.035]  It sounds cartoonish that he loaded a barrel of fuel into the back of his plane too.
[02:01:09.055 --> 02:01:11.257]  I mean, it sounds like more cartoon physics explanations.
[02:01:12.546 --> 02:01:13.307]  Same with 9-11.
[02:01:13.387 --> 02:01:14.668]  They give you cartoon explanations.
[02:01:14.688 --> 02:01:16.329]  Oh, it evaporates.
[02:01:16.369 --> 02:01:20.652]  Oh, we found two passports within a few hours on the ground after all the buildings fell.
[02:01:20.692 --> 02:01:21.113]  Yeah.
[02:01:22.614 --> 02:01:23.014]  Exactly.
[02:01:23.314 --> 02:01:25.036]  We found an Easter Bunny out there, too.
[02:01:25.056 --> 02:01:26.156]  I'm sorry.
[02:01:26.997 --> 02:01:29.559]  I was going to say that the coffee party is a great idea.
[02:01:30.019 --> 02:01:39.927]  And I think it's awesome that you're going to go ahead with it anyway, even though they're trying to get a jump on it with the... What's her name?
[02:01:41.753 --> 02:01:42.253]  Obama.
[02:01:42.834 --> 02:01:45.475]  And that's being done, so people go, coffee party?
[02:01:45.495 --> 02:01:46.696]  You're with Obama!
[02:01:47.176 --> 02:01:54.661]  Instead of us having a coffee party that's more hardcore than the Republican-run Tea Party that they've taken over, now they'll go, you're with the coffee party?
[02:01:55.101 --> 02:01:56.822]  That's some kind of commie group!
[02:01:59.604 --> 02:02:06.008]  So I think, yeah, I think you can go with it right now and still get, you know, like you say, you have way more people on Facebook that'll jump on it and, uh,
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:14.883]  And maybe they'll come to our side, because I think a lot of these people are upset with Obama anyway, and we should really reach out to the Democrats who are starting to wake up.
[02:02:15.724 --> 02:02:17.304]  Man, I appreciate your call.
[02:02:17.664 --> 02:02:19.205]  Let's talk to Tom in Illinois.
[02:02:19.245 --> 02:02:20.065]  Tom, you're on the air.
[02:02:20.085 --> 02:02:23.307]  Hello?
[02:02:23.807 --> 02:02:24.307]  Yes, sir!
[02:02:25.347 --> 02:02:26.048]  Oh, this is Tony.
[02:02:26.068 --> 02:02:26.808]  I'm in Illinois.
[02:02:27.557 --> 02:02:30.140]  Yeah, thank you for waking my mind up.
[02:02:30.180 --> 02:02:30.661]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:02:30.681 --> 02:02:36.888]  My mind used to be in the gutter, but I've watched some of your videos, and I've ordered to call the Republic, and I'm about to start burning them and handing them out to people.
[02:02:37.589 --> 02:02:38.450]  And I have a question.
[02:02:38.470 --> 02:02:44.837]  I was wondering if Ron Paul was elected president, would he try these people that committed treason against our country, would he try them?
[02:02:45.821 --> 02:02:48.142]  I know it would be dangerous to try one of them at a time.
[02:02:48.363 --> 02:02:52.625]  Well, Ron Paul would say under the Constitution, the President doesn't have that power.
[02:02:53.465 --> 02:02:58.068]  But I know he would call for criminal investigations of these people by the Justice Department.
[02:02:59.268 --> 02:03:08.813]  Yes, he said that the bankers have all openly committed crimes, the big private bank heads, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and others, and he's called for state grand juries to indict them.
[02:03:09.193 --> 02:03:10.434]  He's done that on this show before.
[02:03:11.531 --> 02:03:14.278]  I'm talking about the people in the government, like President Bush and Cheney.
[02:03:14.298 --> 02:03:15.400]  They murdered a lot of people.
[02:03:16.142 --> 02:03:17.625]  Millions of, uh, thousands of people.
[02:03:18.167 --> 02:03:19.770]  Cheney shot somebody in the face with a shotgun.
[02:03:20.535 --> 02:03:22.957]  And that's just crazy how people can get away with that.
[02:03:22.977 --> 02:03:25.559]  If I were to do something like that, I'd be spending my life in prison.
[02:03:25.839 --> 02:03:27.240]  Well, it's even worse than that.
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:33.504]  I mean, Cheney, it's now been declassified, wanted to launch a nuclear attack on Russia on 8-8-8 in 2008.
[02:03:34.025 --> 02:03:37.687]  And it was on record that U.S.
[02:03:37.747 --> 02:03:42.751]  and Israeli-backed Georgians attacked South Ossetia, the Russian-held area, and
[02:03:45.919 --> 02:03:49.962]  The CNN said the Russians have attacked and five days later had to admit it wasn't true.
[02:03:49.982 --> 02:03:57.769]  And then I've got neocons criticizing me saying I made it up that the Russians attacked and that I'm a Ruski or something.
[02:03:57.809 --> 02:03:58.730]  I mean it's just, it's just...
[02:03:59.949 --> 02:04:06.931]  It's incredible the level of lies, of the things they will do, the things they will say.
[02:04:06.951 --> 02:04:11.473]  You know, they say, well, you work for the Iranians because you don't want to attack them.
[02:04:11.533 --> 02:04:14.073]  No, I don't want to have World War III start.
[02:04:14.814 --> 02:04:22.096]  Or they say, that Alex Jones, he works for Al Qaeda because he's saying it's a 9-11 inside job.
[02:04:22.116 --> 02:04:26.157]  I mean, I've had mainline publications say that with absolutely no proof.
[02:04:26.177 --> 02:04:27.537]  I mean, it's just asinine.
[02:04:30.247 --> 02:04:36.109]  You know, Ron Paul, if he got elected, would do good just to stay alive and try to audit the Fed and do some things like that.
[02:04:37.029 --> 02:04:40.110]  But, I mean, I can't speak for Ron Paul, what he would do if he was president.
[02:04:40.810 --> 02:04:42.571]  I think we focus too much on the president.
[02:04:43.011 --> 02:04:45.272]  We have 50 states under the Constitution.
[02:04:46.072 --> 02:04:48.012]  The federal government is out of control.
[02:04:48.353 --> 02:04:54.494]  We have to get control of our states and then get control of our federal government right now that's run by offshore banks that are out of control.
[02:04:54.514 --> 02:04:58.936]  Okay, let's talk to Alex, Ray, Marty and others.
[02:04:59.796 --> 02:05:03.457]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:05:03.477 --> 02:05:06.838]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:05:07.078 --> 02:05:11.859]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:05:11.879 --> 02:05:18.120]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:05:18.260 --> 02:05:20.501]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:05:21.021 --> 02:05:21.321]  Tim Geithner?
[02:05:21.341 --> 02:05:21.761]  Bernanke?
[02:05:21.862 --> 02:05:22.622]  They're arsonists!
[02:05:22.662 --> 02:05:23.783]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:05:23.803 --> 02:05:26.044]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:05:39.952 --> 02:05:41.774]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:05:41.794 --> 02:05:46.918]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:05:47.219 --> 02:05:56.587]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:00.319 --> 02:06:03.960]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:04.280 --> 02:06:12.422]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:06:13.143 --> 02:06:17.184]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:06:17.764 --> 02:06:28.587]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:06:29.227 --> 02:06:38.229]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:38.729 --> 02:06:43.790]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:06:44.171 --> 02:06:51.352]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:51.652 --> 02:06:54.393]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:06:58.203 --> 02:07:02.446]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:02.746 --> 02:07:03.367]  Number one.
[02:07:03.667 --> 02:07:06.829]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:07.089 --> 02:07:07.670]  Number two.
[02:07:07.950 --> 02:07:12.493]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:12.833 --> 02:07:13.294]  It's true.
[02:07:13.594 --> 02:07:18.157]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:18.458 --> 02:07:18.918]  Number three.
[02:07:19.278 --> 02:07:22.560]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:22.861 --> 02:07:26.603]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:26.784 --> 02:07:27.324]  Number 4.
[02:07:27.564 --> 02:07:29.946]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:30.326 --> 02:07:33.729]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:34.009 --> 02:07:34.229]  Number 5.
[02:07:34.809 --> 02:07:38.732]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:38.952 --> 02:07:43.716]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:43.996 --> 02:07:48.018]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:48.158 --> 02:07:49.739]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:49.959 --> 02:07:52.040]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:07:52.200 --> 02:07:54.801]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:07:54.821 --> 02:08:02.205]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:02.725 --> 02:08:05.767]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:06.947 --> 02:08:09.348]  We are continuing with wide open phones.
[02:08:11.664 --> 02:08:16.186]  I'm going to take a few more calls right now, then I want to hit on some other news we haven't gotten to yet.
[02:08:18.527 --> 02:08:22.528]  But I want to say this to a lot of the new listeners out there who are tuning in.
[02:08:23.188 --> 02:08:26.290]  Everything we talk about on this show is documented and on record.
[02:08:27.170 --> 02:08:34.693]  We do have an illegitimate, unelected, global corporate government openly set up, announcing that it's taking over our planet.
[02:08:35.555 --> 02:08:45.504]  And that their final political aim is to shut off resources to the planet and have one-child policies and basically live like the communist Chinese.
[02:08:46.425 --> 02:08:51.871]  And earlier I played a CNN clip praising communism and Mao Zedong.
[02:08:52.491 --> 02:08:54.053]  I mean, this is really happening.
[02:08:57.236 --> 02:09:00.459]  And the police are out of control, the government is out of control,
[02:09:02.401 --> 02:09:02.941]  They are.
[02:09:02.961 --> 02:09:04.622]  I mean, this is tyranny.
[02:09:04.702 --> 02:09:06.623]  We know what corruption is.
[02:09:06.703 --> 02:09:07.603]  We know what tyranny is.
[02:09:09.123 --> 02:09:10.064]  I've got a stack of news.
[02:09:10.104 --> 02:09:13.965]  I covered some of it earlier where their states are passing taxes on food.
[02:09:14.345 --> 02:09:15.566]  Only the worst tyrannies do that.
[02:09:16.226 --> 02:09:19.307]  They're getting ready to pass carbon taxes, even if the people don't want it.
[02:09:20.167 --> 02:09:23.269]  Direct taxes on the oil companies that they'll pass on to consumers.
[02:09:24.769 --> 02:09:29.011]  Taxes when you buy dinner that are going to go to state health care programs.
[02:09:32.669 --> 02:09:33.770]  I see articles every day.
[02:09:33.810 --> 02:09:34.771]  Here's USA Today.
[02:09:35.112 --> 02:09:36.973]  Police partner with license plate readers.
[02:09:37.794 --> 02:09:38.175]  Everywhere.
[02:09:38.195 --> 02:09:42.619]  They're tracking your license plate, where you go, not just when you go through toll roads.
[02:09:43.540 --> 02:09:50.426]  It's an Orwellian nightmare and they're using it to control the population and suppress the population.
[02:09:50.486 --> 02:09:51.507]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[02:09:52.649 --> 02:09:56.873]  And the average government bureaucrat or person that works for a corporation that's getting government contracts
[02:09:58.956 --> 02:09:59.656]  They're arrogant.
[02:09:59.756 --> 02:10:00.757]  They think they're winners.
[02:10:00.797 --> 02:10:01.637]  They think it's funny.
[02:10:01.677 --> 02:10:02.958]  They have disdain for the public.
[02:10:03.358 --> 02:10:10.420]  And then so much of the general public has this attitude of, well, how does it affect me?
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:21.285]  You know, you'll tell somebody that tyranny is coming down on them and that they're in trouble and that historically they should be worried and that the establishment has stated all their evil designs and they'll say, how does that affect me?
[02:10:21.565 --> 02:10:22.405]  It's like an arrogance.
[02:10:22.425 --> 02:10:24.846]  Like they have an attitude that if they just say, how does that affect me?
[02:10:24.886 --> 02:10:25.606]  I don't care.
[02:10:25.906 --> 02:10:27.687]  That supposedly gives them power over it.
[02:10:32.372 --> 02:10:39.558]  The biggest thing is we need people to start respecting themselves again and believing in the power they have to say no to this system.
[02:10:39.898 --> 02:10:48.044]  And we need people to reach out to their friends, their family, their co-workers, their neighbors, their local government, with books, with videos, with materials.
[02:10:48.064 --> 02:10:49.045]  I mean, every caller calls in.
[02:10:49.165 --> 02:10:50.966]  I found your show because of your videos.
[02:10:50.986 --> 02:10:51.847]  Somebody gave me a copy.
[02:10:52.127 --> 02:10:52.808]  Almost everybody.
[02:10:53.669 --> 02:10:54.569]  It's over 90%.
[02:10:56.191 --> 02:11:00.414]  Most other talk show hosts or website people I talk to say, yeah, I woke up because of you.
[02:11:03.393 --> 02:11:04.794]  Now, I don't even want that credit.
[02:11:04.835 --> 02:11:06.536]  That's a dangerous position to be in.
[02:11:07.237 --> 02:11:10.500]  Because all the COINTELPRO and government media attacks come our way.
[02:11:11.521 --> 02:11:14.965]  But in the end, I've done my job because I woke people up with the truth.
[02:11:14.985 --> 02:11:21.411]  You know, I've done 2 hours, 3 hours, and 11 minutes today, and I haven't even plugged any of the books or videos.
[02:11:22.993 --> 02:11:26.296]  And we've got this great new video, A Lamp in the Dark, The Untold Story of the Bible.
[02:11:27.142 --> 02:11:28.763]  And how the New World Order tried to suppress it.
[02:11:28.823 --> 02:11:32.806]  Great new video from the folks that made the three-part series, America's Secret Beginnings.
[02:11:33.727 --> 02:11:40.212]  We have Fall of the Republic that gives you a wide-spectrum analysis of the entire system and what makes the globalists tick and how to stop them.
[02:11:40.633 --> 02:11:46.037]  How Weed Won the West exposes government drug dealing and how they want to use drug laws now against vitamins and minerals.
[02:11:48.779 --> 02:11:55.124]  Of course, Endgame covers the whole eugenics angle and what governs the New World Order's thought processes.
[02:11:58.871 --> 02:12:12.514]  And then, of course, we have this video that we covered yesterday, Shadow Government, that I didn't make but that we carry and discount, that covers the whole surveillance tracking grid and how it's run by a private global government.
[02:12:13.834 --> 02:12:15.214]  And we're now shipping this book.
[02:12:15.254 --> 02:12:19.935]  It officially comes out on the 8th, but I can now ship it because you'll get it on or around the 8th for all the pre-orders.
[02:12:20.455 --> 02:12:22.136]  Jesse Ventura, he's on next week.
[02:12:23.016 --> 02:12:23.416]  We've got
[02:12:25.387 --> 02:12:28.829]  Friends Forecaster Gerald Cilente was actually in Chile for the earthquake.
[02:12:29.229 --> 02:12:32.011]  He'll be joining us to talk about the deteriorating economy tomorrow.
[02:12:32.431 --> 02:12:35.754]  But Jesse Ventura, American Conspiracies.
[02:12:35.794 --> 02:12:37.815]  This book is $24.95 in hardback.
[02:12:38.795 --> 02:12:39.476]  Just came out.
[02:12:39.816 --> 02:12:40.817]  Covers a whole host of
[02:12:42.173 --> 02:12:50.643]  New World Order topics that Jesse Ventura exposes and discusses, government assassinations, government narcotics trafficking, New World Order, eugenics, it's all in here.
[02:12:51.464 --> 02:12:55.950]  It's $19.95 at InfoWars.com and no one has a deal anywhere near this.
[02:12:56.390 --> 02:13:00.134]  You can get Loose Change Final Cut, a preeminent 9-11 film that I produced.
[02:13:00.695 --> 02:13:00.975]  Free.
[02:13:01.555 --> 02:13:04.996]  Or you can get Reflections and Warnings, my final interview with Aaron Russo before he died.
[02:13:05.256 --> 02:13:08.177]  It's a documentary in its own right, 90 minutes long, with a bunch of extras.
[02:13:08.477 --> 02:13:13.818]  You can get one of those two films free when you order Jesse Ventura's American Conspiracies.
[02:13:15.119 --> 02:13:16.979]  So that's a $44.95 value for $19.95.
[02:13:17.139 --> 02:13:17.579]  More than 50% off.
[02:13:17.599 --> 02:13:18.540]  Right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:13:28.715 --> 02:13:30.216]  You can also call toll free 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[02:13:30.236 --> 02:13:32.499]  You can also write to me, InfoWars, write to InfoWars, P.O.
[02:13:32.539 --> 02:13:33.119]  Box 19549, that's P.O.
[02:13:33.159 --> 02:13:33.820]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[02:13:48.464 --> 02:13:53.828]  And yes, your purchase of the books and videos and materials makes this radio show possible, but that's secondary.
[02:13:54.468 --> 02:13:55.349]  These are great tools.
[02:13:55.389 --> 02:13:56.830]  You may know all about the New World Order.
[02:13:57.250 --> 02:13:59.192]  Give your friends and family this handsome book.
[02:13:59.732 --> 02:14:00.713]  They may read it.
[02:14:01.293 --> 02:14:03.114]  Or you can read the book and give them one of the DVDs.
[02:14:04.996 --> 02:14:11.020]  We've also got free t-shirt deals, a bunch of other... We've never cut prices down to this level, because my main mission is just to get this out.
[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:17.284]  Lastly, before I go to more calls and then news, coming out on April 15th,
[02:14:19.482 --> 02:14:25.648]  Tax Day, Jason Burmese's two plus hour film will be out.
[02:14:26.109 --> 02:14:27.810]  You can start pre-ordering it in about a week and a half.
[02:14:28.471 --> 02:14:40.804]  April 15th, this film, it's got the best, I mean we've spent a lot of money on this film, 18 months in the making, three graphics guys working on it, Jason, Aaron Dykes, Rob Jacobson,
[02:14:43.249 --> 02:14:47.152]  And it's just a compendium of globalist crimes and then now what they're currently setting up.
[02:14:47.192 --> 02:14:48.413]  It really is a powerful film.
[02:14:49.194 --> 02:14:52.076]  And it's Invisible Empire, New World Order, Defined.
[02:14:53.617 --> 02:14:55.218]  And also we've got Police State 4.
[02:14:55.439 --> 02:14:58.801]  I haven't put a Police State film out since 2002.
[02:14:59.882 --> 02:15:00.703]  And I worked on this.
[02:15:00.763 --> 02:15:03.945]  It's got three directors, Rob Doo, Jason Douglas, Alex Jones.
[02:15:06.164 --> 02:15:14.498]  It's the FEMA camps, the New World Order, just all the latest police state grid information, two hour plus film, Police State 4.
[02:15:15.058 --> 02:15:16.561]  That's gonna come out a week or so after.
[02:15:16.581 --> 02:15:19.105]  I haven't set the release date yet for Police State 4.
[02:15:19.425 --> 02:15:20.006]  The point is,
[02:15:21.570 --> 02:15:27.632]  If you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member, you will see the films first on the release date, and the DVDs will ship then, in the highest quality.
[02:15:28.352 --> 02:15:39.476]  And you can download them, burn them to disk, DivX copies that play on most DVD players, my book, Paul Watson's book, my live radio slash TV show, better audio archives, video archives of the radio show every day.
[02:15:40.936 --> 02:15:43.818]  And in April, it'll be six years we've had PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:15:43.838 --> 02:15:48.701]  We just keep adding new functions and features and news and higher quality podcasts.
[02:15:48.781 --> 02:15:54.705]  It's 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month to get a PrisonPlanet.TV membership.
[02:15:55.525 --> 02:16:00.688]  And when you get a PrisonPlanet.TV membership for a year, instead of getting a trial monthly, you get three months free.
[02:16:01.069 --> 02:16:08.073]  And your membership, I want to thank those that are members, makes this radio show and what we do so much possible because our bandwidth bill
[02:16:09.906 --> 02:16:24.179]  is massive and we are just exponentially growing so it's going up and up and up and up and the economy is falling apart so we're bringing in the same amount of money we were bringing in three years ago.
[02:16:24.759 --> 02:16:27.882]  Our audience in the last two years is actually quadruple now.
[02:16:27.962 --> 02:16:30.925]  You can go to Alexa, all the rating sites and see it for yourself.
[02:16:32.286 --> 02:16:36.730]  The radio audience has probably gotten ten times bigger the last three years but internet traffic
[02:16:37.728 --> 02:16:38.308]  Four times.
[02:16:38.929 --> 02:16:40.610]  It's actually doubled in the last year.
[02:16:40.750 --> 02:16:43.372]  So when I say quadruple, that's an underestimation.
[02:16:45.193 --> 02:16:46.754]  But the same amount of money is coming in.
[02:16:48.815 --> 02:16:51.837]  So we're OK, but I'm building the TV studio.
[02:16:52.458 --> 02:16:53.599]  That's been hell with the city.
[02:16:53.739 --> 02:16:55.980]  My God, six months of trying to get permits with these people.
[02:16:56.821 --> 02:16:57.361]  It's finally there.
[02:16:57.421 --> 02:16:57.921]  They're building it.
[02:16:59.683 --> 02:17:02.304]  And we live in such a communist country.
[02:17:02.324 --> 02:17:03.265]  It's just indescribable.
[02:17:07.438 --> 02:17:09.761]  The point is we're expanding, we're moving forward.
[02:17:11.083 --> 02:17:17.551]  I am building a mega social networking slash blog slash you name it meetup type site.
[02:17:17.731 --> 02:17:25.241]  We've now committed that's being built by a top firm here in Austin and consult consultation with my IT guys.
[02:17:26.733 --> 02:17:30.958]  And we're going to launch the coffee party, which was our listeners' idea that Obama has now stolen.
[02:17:30.978 --> 02:17:34.743]  I mean, to give you an idea of how good our ideas are that come from the listeners.
[02:17:35.384 --> 02:17:36.345]  So we've got to counter that.
[02:17:36.365 --> 02:17:39.388]  Everybody should start a coffee party and say, no, this is not your deal, Obama.
[02:17:39.409 --> 02:17:42.012]  All of that is going on.
[02:17:45.606 --> 02:17:50.769]  This Obama lady claims that the federal government is good and that we need to work through it and that that's the coffee party.
[02:17:50.809 --> 02:17:52.190]  She's worked for Obama.
[02:17:52.590 --> 02:17:53.650]  She's one of his minions.
[02:17:54.251 --> 02:17:57.152]  She claims she loves the Tea Party and wants them to join her coffee party.
[02:17:57.553 --> 02:17:58.973]  CNN, everybody else has had her on.
[02:17:58.993 --> 02:17:59.574]  They're pushing her.
[02:18:00.472 --> 02:18:01.813]  She's worked for the New York Times.
[02:18:01.833 --> 02:18:04.615]  They didn't tell you that when they wrote an article about how great she is.
[02:18:05.256 --> 02:18:10.821]  So now Obama, like the Republicans, posing as Tea Party people, Obama wants to come in with the Coffee Party and take it over.
[02:18:11.081 --> 02:18:13.403]  This is what she said on her Facebook about Tea Party people.
[02:18:14.003 --> 02:18:15.905]  We're in mortal danger of going backwards.
[02:18:17.571 --> 02:18:18.371]  Get some coffee.
[02:18:18.552 --> 02:18:21.373]  Get off your butt and join the movement for change.
[02:18:21.813 --> 02:18:23.314]  No more reading tea leaves.
[02:18:23.394 --> 02:18:24.255]  Get the job done.
[02:18:24.315 --> 02:18:25.275]  No more excuses.
[02:18:25.835 --> 02:18:27.977]  Stop the bad punditry.
[02:18:28.017 --> 02:18:29.898]  Stop reading tea leaves.
[02:18:30.278 --> 02:18:32.199]  We will overwhelm the polling stations in November.
[02:18:32.239 --> 02:18:32.919]  We want change.
[02:18:32.979 --> 02:18:33.760]  We want change.
[02:18:34.620 --> 02:18:39.783]  We must deal with reality instead of indulging in paranoid fantasies of the Tea Party.
[02:18:41.580 --> 02:18:42.601]  And it just goes on and on.
[02:18:43.242 --> 02:18:45.283]  We're not going to take this tea crap anymore.
[02:18:45.623 --> 02:18:46.584]  Let's work for change.
[02:18:47.084 --> 02:19:05.599]  So, this is her just two months ago, but now, oh, she wants to work with the tea parties and take them over with the coffee party to wake up the tea party, even using the slogan that my listeners, again, two months ago, emailing and calling, I don't even know who you are, saying, Alex, you need to launch this.
[02:19:05.619 --> 02:19:07.180]  You need to get it going.
[02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:09.922]  And I registered domains a month ago and just never did it.
[02:19:11.326 --> 02:19:13.968]  Obviously, I can't travel around the country and start rallies and do it.
[02:19:14.028 --> 02:19:22.053]  We'll just explain what the real Coffee Party is from the listeners and my idea of saying, look, the Republicans are taking over the Tea Parties.
[02:19:22.374 --> 02:19:23.715]  We want this to be non-partisan.
[02:19:23.735 --> 02:19:25.556]  The Coffee Party is here to wake up the Tea Party.
[02:19:25.896 --> 02:19:28.438]  Don't be co-opted by the Republicans and Democrats.
[02:19:28.978 --> 02:19:31.140]  Now the Democrats are openly coming into co-op.
[02:19:31.860 --> 02:19:34.362]  They have to do this or they'll be replaced with the American people.
[02:19:36.152 --> 02:19:40.734]  But again, work through your states, take over your states peacefully, through the legislative process.
[02:19:40.754 --> 02:19:41.615]  We have the numbers.
[02:19:42.235 --> 02:19:43.156]  We can do this together.
[02:19:44.336 --> 02:19:54.502]  Your phone call is straight ahead with this article by Paul Watson, or it's actually Steve Watson, coffee party founder, is Obama campaign operative, is so important.
[02:19:54.882 --> 02:19:56.363]  Get it at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:19:56.383 --> 02:19:57.103]  Get it out to everybody.
[02:19:57.363 --> 02:19:57.944]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:58.834 --> 02:20:04.196]  For safety, you lock doors, set alarms, buy anti-virus software, maybe even have a watchdog.
[02:20:04.296 --> 02:20:06.316]  Do you care as much about your air and water?

[02:20:28.343 --> 02:20:37.629]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:20:37.669 --> 02:20:38.410]  This capitalism?
[02:20:38.470 --> 02:20:44.614]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:20:44.734 --> 02:20:45.555]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:20:45.615 --> 02:20:48.717]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[02:20:48.857 --> 02:20:49.637]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:20:49.657 --> 02:20:51.018]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:20:51.058 --> 02:20:51.358]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:51.398 --> 02:20:51.659]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:20:59.444 --> 02:21:00.284]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:21:00.484 --> 02:21:05.808]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:21:06.008 --> 02:21:06.428]  I get it.
[02:21:06.548 --> 02:21:15.874]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:21:16.174 --> 02:21:17.295]  That's not what's happening.
[02:21:17.575 --> 02:21:25.823]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:21:26.043 --> 02:21:29.326]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:21:29.446 --> 02:21:33.530]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:21:33.710 --> 02:21:35.291]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:21:35.311 --> 02:21:38.554]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[02:21:39.275 --> 02:21:42.878]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:21:43.078 --> 02:21:43.779]  You should, too.
[02:21:43.979 --> 02:21:44.959]  Find out what they know.
[02:21:45.119 --> 02:21:48.482]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:21:48.502 --> 02:21:48.562]  800-686-2237.
[02:21:48.582 --> 02:21:48.722]  800-686-2237.
[02:21:48.742 --> 02:21:48.962]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:21:48.982 --> 02:21:51.564]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:21:51.584 --> 02:21:53.265]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:53.285 --> 02:21:54.746]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:22:09.494 --> 02:22:12.155]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:22:12.175 --> 02:22:18.396]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:22:18.556 --> 02:22:23.577]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:22:23.738 --> 02:22:33.740]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:22:33.860 --> 02:22:35.961]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:22:36.201 --> 02:22:37.522]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:22:37.782 --> 02:22:40.063]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:22:40.243 --> 02:22:42.083]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:22:42.364 --> 02:22:47.186]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:22:47.526 --> 02:22:56.890]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:23:30.142 --> 02:23:31.203]  No painful injections.
[02:23:31.383 --> 02:23:31.823]  We're good to go.
[02:24:01.865 --> 02:24:06.808]  I'm ready for it.
[02:24:07.629 --> 02:24:09.350]  Let's go to Alex in California.
[02:24:09.430 --> 02:24:10.371]  Alex, you're on the air.
[02:24:10.391 --> 02:24:12.673]  Yeah, hi.
[02:24:12.733 --> 02:24:13.353]  Welcome.
[02:24:14.274 --> 02:24:17.156]  I was watching Fall of the Republic, and it's a great movie.
[02:24:17.336 --> 02:24:20.638]  There was just one point I noticed when you were talking about the Explorer program.
[02:24:22.519 --> 02:24:29.104]  They were training them to search out terrorists, and you called them, you were saying they were a co-affiliate of Boy Scouts, and that's what the article said.
[02:24:29.864 --> 02:24:32.548]  I just wanted to let you know, um, I'm a longtime Boy Scout.
[02:24:32.628 --> 02:24:33.389]  I'm an Eagle Scout.
[02:24:33.569 --> 02:24:35.532]  I'm the Assistant Scoutmaster in my troop right now.
[02:24:36.253 --> 02:24:38.776]  And I teach my scouts nothing but patriotism.
[02:24:39.457 --> 02:24:43.303]  Um, I point out, like, on the, uh, scout symbol, there's a
[02:24:44.088 --> 02:24:45.249]  Sir, let me just throw this out.
[02:24:45.289 --> 02:24:49.973]  When I put that film out three months ago, four months ago, people didn't even believe that.
[02:24:50.453 --> 02:24:56.298]  Now the LAPD and a federal grant officially took over the Boy Scouts Explorer program.
[02:24:56.638 --> 02:25:05.365]  And in the New York Times, I believe that was Arizona, the particular training, or was it New Mexico, they were training to take on disgruntled veterans.
[02:25:05.926 --> 02:25:10.950]  And it showed photos of the mock dead veterans taken on by the 14-year-old Boy Scouts.
[02:25:10.970 --> 02:25:12.931]  So I know the Boy Scouts have been good.
[02:25:13.792 --> 02:25:18.054]  But just like Hitler took over the German Boy Scouts, the same thing is happening.
[02:25:18.074 --> 02:25:20.615]  And they've got Girl Scouts training to spy on people.
[02:25:21.075 --> 02:25:22.716]  I mean, that's Associated Press.
[02:25:22.836 --> 02:25:24.717]  This is really happening.
[02:25:26.438 --> 02:25:27.638]  Okay, I see that.
[02:25:28.239 --> 02:25:33.341]  Well, I just want to let you know as well, with my troop, that's not happening.
[02:25:33.461 --> 02:25:35.642]  And I assure you that I'm teaching my guys.
[02:25:37.213 --> 02:25:43.675]  Exactly, so we're trying to get the scouts of America to say no to Homeland Security taking it over.
[02:25:44.901 --> 02:25:46.022]  Yeah, that's what I've been doing.
[02:25:46.042 --> 02:25:52.366]  The scout symbol, like I was saying, the shield represents freedom and the scouts' readiness to defend freedom.
[02:25:52.486 --> 02:25:54.788]  And I make sure our scouts know that and other troops know that.
[02:25:55.408 --> 02:25:58.710]  Well, great job, Alex, but we're not saying the Boy Scouts are bad.
[02:25:58.730 --> 02:26:00.051]  We're saying it's being taken over.
[02:26:00.352 --> 02:26:03.574]  It's like saying the German military wasn't bad until Hitler got control of it.
[02:26:04.174 --> 02:26:08.797]  I mean, our country's been hijacked by offshore corporations, and they're turning everything into evil.
[02:26:09.258 --> 02:26:13.961]  And so there's a battle for the heart and soul of not just the Boy Scouts, but the Girl Scouts and the Brownies right now.
[02:26:15.617 --> 02:26:16.198]  Well, okay.
[02:26:16.378 --> 02:26:17.358]  I didn't know that, actually.
[02:26:17.538 --> 02:26:18.839]  That's good to get that information.
[02:26:18.899 --> 02:26:30.285]  And I'll take it up with, you know, with my council and my district and take it as high as I can to see, you know, to make sure that it isn't put in because Boy Scouts are not meant to be trained as a militant group that search out terrorists.
[02:26:30.826 --> 02:26:37.509]  You know, they're just... Sir, I've got Boy Scout explorers out at checkpoints in Florida helping search people.
[02:26:37.549 --> 02:26:39.530]  I mean, it's far down the road.
[02:26:39.570 --> 02:26:40.491]  I appreciate your call.
[02:26:42.281 --> 02:26:44.062]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ray in Virginia.
[02:26:44.122 --> 02:26:44.822]  Ray, you're on the air.
[02:26:45.482 --> 02:26:46.282]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:26:46.602 --> 02:26:46.943]  Welcome.
[02:26:47.883 --> 02:26:49.503]  I'm here in Virginia.
[02:26:49.563 --> 02:26:55.745]  I'm son of the Revolutionary War, the American Revolutionary War, and directly related to Thomas Jefferson.
[02:26:55.765 --> 02:26:59.166]  I've been to Smithsonian, met Reagan, and all that kind of stuff.
[02:27:00.307 --> 02:27:06.829]  Our family rejected the Masons a while back, my grandpa, and we're American patriots.
[02:27:07.509 --> 02:27:09.230]  I fight the Agenda 21 all the time.
[02:27:10.737 --> 02:27:16.162]  Been to the Wake County meeting, and trying to expose this globalist lie about global warming.
[02:27:16.182 --> 02:27:17.043]  It's just a religion.
[02:27:17.624 --> 02:27:19.886]  With Mikhail Gorbachev and Maury Strong.
[02:27:20.646 --> 02:27:28.053]  Yeah, they say, they say at Green Shield, with those two, that humans need a religion, and the religion will be that humans are bad.
[02:27:28.714 --> 02:27:34.760]  And that's what the UN says, and that's what this whole fake environmentalism is, is an excuse to cut off people's resources.
[02:27:35.933 --> 02:27:37.273]  That's exactly right.
[02:27:37.453 --> 02:27:37.934]  It's awful.
[02:27:38.534 --> 02:27:42.595]  And Maury Strong, he's a scumbag, and so is Mikel Gorbachev.
[02:27:43.735 --> 02:27:54.458]  They have in Baca, Colorado, their own, we went there and took pictures, they have their own temple set up for Gaea, this green Shrek-looking... Yeah, Maury Strong's wife runs that.
[02:27:55.308 --> 02:27:55.909]  Hannah Strong.
[02:27:55.969 --> 02:27:57.852]  I met her and did an interview with her.
[02:27:58.333 --> 02:28:04.182]  These people believe that Gaya came to them and told them to do this back in the 80s, by the way.
[02:28:06.124 --> 02:28:08.648]  We've had Hunt on and others that were in those meetings.
[02:28:09.594 --> 02:28:16.600]  Oh yeah, I met Mr. Hunt, and when we were out there, we went out to California, and we're all over the place.
[02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:18.661]  We've been doing this in Wake County, North Carolina.
[02:28:18.681 --> 02:28:20.182]  They have a sustainable development meeting.
[02:28:20.663 --> 02:28:22.244]  Man, they're taking that whole city over, man.
[02:28:22.404 --> 02:28:24.146]  It's like Little Rock, Arkansas.
[02:28:24.606 --> 02:28:26.107]  They're implementing laws.
[02:28:26.147 --> 02:28:31.952]  Sir, in Austin, they just take anybody's property they want, they openly give the property they steal to former mayors.
[02:28:32.492 --> 02:28:37.074]  They've hired a special forces commander, this was in the Statesman, to run all the land grabbing.
[02:28:37.314 --> 02:28:40.695]  They're going to put a $2.6 billion tax on energy in the next three years.
[02:28:40.735 --> 02:28:42.375]  In three years, $2.6 billion.
[02:28:42.916 --> 02:28:47.217]  They are just raping everyone, saying you can't pull well water without a license from LCRA.
[02:28:47.517 --> 02:28:49.158]  They're harassing the farms and ranches.
[02:28:49.638 --> 02:28:50.958]  And that's just where I live.
[02:28:50.998 --> 02:28:55.620]  I mean, it's just a descending group of vicious, control-freak criminals.
[02:28:56.480 --> 02:28:58.766]  Who call their takeover environmentalism.
[02:28:59.106 --> 02:29:01.712]  It has nothing to do with the environment.
[02:29:01.773 --> 02:29:05.060]  We have to route these devils out everywhere they are.
[02:29:05.120 --> 02:29:06.123]  I appreciate your call.
[02:29:06.937 --> 02:29:11.840]  Now I'm going to play part of the Ron Paul interview because we went live at the start of the last hour.
[02:29:12.240 --> 02:29:14.061]  Some stations don't carry that first five minutes.
[02:29:14.342 --> 02:29:15.162]  We skipped a break.
[02:29:15.202 --> 02:29:17.684]  I want people to hear what we talked about with Ron Paul.
[02:29:17.744 --> 02:29:21.706]  Government narcotics trafficking, world government, the awakening that's happening.
[02:29:21.806 --> 02:29:22.707]  So much coming up.
[02:29:22.747 --> 02:29:28.991]  Then more calls and some other key news stories after we air part of this Ron Paul interview coming out of the next break.
[02:29:30.265 --> 02:29:32.266]  But I'll go back to what I was saying earlier in the hour.
[02:29:32.366 --> 02:29:35.107]  You hear the listeners calling in who were woken up with my films.
[02:29:35.927 --> 02:29:43.269]  The number one thing you can do is get Fall of the Republic, Endgame, Terror Storm, some of the best films I've made, and make copies and give them to people.
[02:29:43.809 --> 02:29:45.710]  Every person you wake up is invaluable.
[02:29:45.770 --> 02:29:46.730]  It's person to person.
[02:29:47.030 --> 02:29:48.491]  Nothing can stop you if you take action.
[02:29:48.931 --> 02:29:49.851]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.331 --> 02:29:51.932]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.852 --> 02:29:55.533]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:31:59.504 --> 02:32:00.365]  Andy Anderson here.
[02:32:00.565 --> 02:32:04.831]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[02:32:04.971 --> 02:32:10.638]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[02:32:10.778 --> 02:32:15.024]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, good-bye effectiveness?
[02:32:15.124 --> 02:32:16.826]  No more protection till you use it again.
[02:32:16.966 --> 02:32:18.127]  PureWorks to the rescue!
[02:32:18.307 --> 02:32:22.649]  Our FDA-compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.
[02:32:22.710 --> 02:32:24.751]  Their killing power lasts up to four hours.

[02:32:37.939 --> 02:32:39.540]  It's even safe around pets and children.
[02:32:39.620 --> 02:32:42.682]  You'll love how your skin feels with PureWorks Soft and Supple.
[02:32:42.802 --> 02:32:43.422]  No more dry skin,
[02:32:43.522 --> 02:32:44.042]  Big Brother.
[02:33:04.850 --> 02:33:05.891]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:06.632 --> 02:33:07.713]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:08.393 --> 02:33:09.194]  You want answers?
[02:33:09.974 --> 02:33:10.895]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:10.915 --> 02:33:15.179]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:15.719 --> 02:33:19.762]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.443 --> 02:33:29.965]  We always look forward to our once a month visit with Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:33:30.005 --> 02:33:31.305]  He's gotta go in 14 minutes.
[02:33:31.325 --> 02:33:33.666]  I got my atomic clock to a key vote.
[02:33:34.266 --> 02:33:35.307]  Gotta be in a committee room.
[02:33:35.647 --> 02:33:36.548]  So he's with us now.
[02:33:36.628 --> 02:33:37.628]  I'm gonna move quickly.
[02:33:38.088 --> 02:33:41.790]  First off, Congressman, you won the straw poll at CPAC.
[02:33:43.010 --> 02:33:46.152]  Proving that most of the Republicans are not warmongering neocons.
[02:33:46.172 --> 02:33:48.292]  You got 84% approval rating in Texas.
[02:33:48.613 --> 02:33:50.953]  You won by a record 80% in the primary.
[02:33:51.394 --> 02:33:54.655]  Showing that America supports what you're doing.
[02:33:54.995 --> 02:33:59.497]  Can you comment on the fact that, well your take on this?
[02:34:00.436 --> 02:34:07.682]  I was very pleased and somewhat surprised, but it was a delight to have won that CPAC vote.
[02:34:08.242 --> 02:34:12.766]  You know, what was interesting is, you know, the people who oppose us, they're still significant.
[02:34:12.806 --> 02:34:18.790]  If I get 32% of the vote, that means there's a large number still complaining, and they're part of the establishment.
[02:34:19.070 --> 02:34:23.754]  But what I thought was interesting is all the sour grapes that was expressed afterwards.
[02:34:23.774 --> 02:34:27.157]  They were complaining, and, oh, this is not for real, you know, like they did in the campaign.
[02:34:28.255 --> 02:34:35.841]  What was interesting is somebody said that, you know, what we need to do is for CPAC to have any credibility, they have to change the way they vote.
[02:34:36.261 --> 02:34:48.390]  So they made a suggestion that nobody under 25 would be allowed to vote, which means, and you know it too, that there are a lot of young people who are interested in what we're talking about, and I think that's fortunate.
[02:34:48.430 --> 02:34:49.711]  You know, the next generation is
[02:34:50.291 --> 02:34:53.372]  Not later on, but currently they're inheriting this mess.
[02:34:53.613 --> 02:35:01.996]  So I'm delighted to talk to young people, but this whole idea that the people who don't like us challenging the status quo, well, let's not let them vote next time.
[02:35:02.096 --> 02:35:12.561]  But I think that there's a lot of people who are coming our way every year, and you know in the last two or three years that there's been tremendous growth in our movement, and that makes me very encouraged.
[02:35:13.647 --> 02:35:14.227]  Absolutely.
[02:35:14.347 --> 02:35:19.268]  I want to cut to the chase here, and before we get into the banking situation.
[02:35:19.849 --> 02:35:26.730]  A few months ago, you were speaking at a Campaign for Liberty event, and you threw the gauntlet down, as you did back in the 80s in some videos I've seen.
[02:35:27.030 --> 02:35:29.591]  You said, we've had a CIA coup in America.
[02:35:29.891 --> 02:35:30.971]  They're bringing in the drugs.
[02:35:31.052 --> 02:35:36.833]  Most people don't know, in 96, the CIA inspector general before Congress admitted that.
[02:35:37.473 --> 02:35:38.413]  But it's wider than that.
[02:35:38.453 --> 02:35:40.254]  We know Wall Street and the banking cartel
[02:35:40.774 --> 02:35:59.862]  The Federal Reserve System, through Yale and other outfits, set up the OSS and CIA, and you came right out and basically said, this is our illegitimate government, and that ties into the banks engineering the financial collapse, now saying they're getting ready for an even bigger collapse sometime this year in a constitution of the world run by the banks.
[02:36:00.322 --> 02:36:02.705]  Well, I have trouble naming names because I don't know all the names.
[02:36:17.783 --> 02:36:26.089]  The one thing I can verify is that the people who should have responsibility for our national security and intelligence gathering, the U.S.
[02:36:26.129 --> 02:36:28.910]  Congress, they have no idea what's going on.
[02:36:29.351 --> 02:36:30.612]  And that's the real problem.
[02:36:33.373 --> 02:36:34.534]  It fits together.
[02:36:34.554 --> 02:36:39.056]  You know, the secrecy of the CIA as well as the secrecy of the Fed.
[02:36:39.076 --> 02:36:41.557]  They control the money and they control secret government.
[02:36:41.597 --> 02:36:53.283]  People have referred to the CIA as a secret army for the president, but sometimes I wonder whether the president even has total control of the CIA as well, as many stories have been written about that.
[02:36:53.903 --> 02:36:58.686]  So it's something that I think the American people have to realize.
[02:36:59.207 --> 02:37:05.271]  We do know, there's been evidence brought forth that the CIA actually can own banks.
[02:37:05.431 --> 02:37:11.195]  And there's been fairly strong evidence that the CIA's been involved in drug dealing.
[02:37:11.375 --> 02:37:18.500]  There are times when I think the war in Afghanistan, we say it has to do with pipes and oil, gas pipeline and oil.
[02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:19.140]  Yes.
[02:37:35.041 --> 02:37:49.220]  I don't take the position that I know all those answers, and I don't know everything that the Fed does, but my approach is that we, the people, the people deserve, and the Congress has a responsibility to find out what they're doing.
[02:37:49.820 --> 02:37:52.042]  And if they're not doing it, fine and dandy.
[02:37:52.102 --> 02:37:52.883]  We'll clear the air.
[02:37:52.923 --> 02:38:02.790]  But if they are doing it, it will give us more ammunition for the reason why we need a different monetary system and we need to have a different system of collecting intelligence because they can tell us anything.
[02:38:03.170 --> 02:38:05.072]  Remember how we went to war in Iraq?
[02:38:05.152 --> 02:38:07.093]  The CIA was very much involved.
[02:38:07.173 --> 02:38:11.977]  Up there, they say the CIA, oh, they have weapons of mass destruction.
[02:38:11.997 --> 02:38:13.238]  They're about to attack us.
[02:38:13.718 --> 02:38:15.840]  And it was based on false information.
[02:38:16.480 --> 02:38:24.785]  And this is what disturbs me the most, and that's why I want much, much more transparency of what our government is doing.
[02:38:25.485 --> 02:38:29.267]  Well, those were strong statements you made a few months ago, and you just echoed them.
[02:38:29.307 --> 02:38:36.391]  But specifically, Congress, as you know, has had hearings in the 70s about the shadow government, continuity of government.
[02:38:37.052 --> 02:38:41.834]  The Homeland Security Committee in the House has not been allowed to see the full text of PDD 51.
[02:38:43.175 --> 02:38:47.977]  We know we've seen a 12-fold in the last eight-year increase in opium out of Afghanistan.
[02:38:48.657 --> 02:38:59.241]  We know that two years ago, a CIA aircraft that had been used for torture flights crashed in Mexico with pure cocaine, three and a half tons, meaning coming directly from the source, uncut.
[02:39:00.501 --> 02:39:04.782]  I mean, this just comes out in Mena, Arkansas, over and over again.
[02:39:04.802 --> 02:39:08.484]  And so when you talk about a coup over America,
[02:39:09.704 --> 02:39:12.105]  How do we ever ferret this out and remove it?
[02:39:12.265 --> 02:39:16.607]  I mean, do we start, as you've been calling for, an audit of the private Federal Reserve?
[02:39:16.767 --> 02:39:19.948]  Yeah, it won't happen until the people become really outraged.
[02:39:19.988 --> 02:39:34.254]  They are growing in their outrage, but it has to translate into different ideas and different respect for the Constitution, different people up here, and we're in the midst of this transition, and as the crisis worsens, you know, the real challenge is, is we'll
[02:39:34.674 --> 02:39:35.354]  We're good to go.
[02:39:50.401 --> 02:40:12.738]  We have to do our best to get as many people to agree with us as possible so that in the rebuilding that we have some ideas about what the monetary system should be like and what our foreign policy ought to be like, which means that if we had a proper foreign policy, the incentive to have this CIA making excuses for knowing everything about us and everything that's going on in the world
[02:40:13.118 --> 02:40:13.958]  That would all change.
[02:40:13.998 --> 02:40:24.520]  I don't believe that we shouldn't have some intelligence gathering, but I don't like these clandestine operations and killings and things that we've known to have happen.
[02:40:25.280 --> 02:40:40.943]  Well, dovetailing with that, you grilled Bernanke a few days ago, and then the chairman, for those who haven't seen the video, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com, Frank, agreed with you and said, we need an investigation of the admitted, and I went and pulled the articles up.
[02:40:41.303 --> 02:40:41.723]  Yeah.
[02:40:57.788 --> 02:41:01.629]  Tens of billions of drug money has been found in the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
[02:41:02.149 --> 02:41:04.830]  That was in 2000, that was in the AP.
[02:41:05.250 --> 02:41:07.950]  And then Bernanke just laughs at you and says it doesn't exist.
[02:41:07.990 --> 02:41:22.194]  It's like POTOC from the Southern Poverty Law Center laughing and saying these Tea Party kooks believe in a world government when you've got every global leader calling for global government, the IMF calling for a new world order, Herman Van Rompuy, Ban Ki-moon calling for it.
[02:41:22.674 --> 02:41:26.679]  I mean, I think they're really destroying what credibility they had left by stonewalling us.
[02:41:26.899 --> 02:41:38.252]  Can you speak specifically to congressional investigations separate from an audit just directly on, you know, is the Federal Reserve involved in Greece?
[02:41:38.312 --> 02:41:41.335]  Well, we know they gave the money to Goldman Sachs and we know they are involved.
[02:41:41.776 --> 02:41:41.936]  Right.
[02:41:42.456 --> 02:41:51.658]  No, and he used the word bizarre, so he was accusing me of being bizarre, which means anybody who agrees with my concerns are considered bizarre as well.
[02:41:52.218 --> 02:41:58.999]  And you're right in commenting about what Barney Frank said at the end, at the end of my questioning, that we should look into it.
[02:41:59.440 --> 02:42:06.141]  And to his credit, he has sent a letter to the chairman, Bernanke, and Carbon copied me.
[02:42:06.961 --> 02:42:14.027]  And he's insisting that the Federal Reserve respond to my charges, look into it.
[02:42:14.187 --> 02:42:23.895]  He asked Bernanke to contact my office to go over the details of the concerns that I've had, and then report back.
[02:42:24.355 --> 02:42:30.216]  So, Barney Frank did follow up with, interestingly, Barney Frank was involved with Henry Gonzales.
[02:42:30.276 --> 02:42:36.278]  And you know that Henry Gonzales was against the Federal Reserve and demanded these investigations.
[02:42:36.358 --> 02:42:41.979]  And the gentleman that wrote the book, from the University of Texas, he worked with Gonzales.
[02:42:42.039 --> 02:42:44.260]  And this is, so he has first-hand information.
[02:42:44.300 --> 02:42:46.760]  To call this bizarre is off the wall.
[02:42:47.641 --> 02:42:53.822]  Arbach was in the Federal Reserve and the Congress.
[02:42:54.162 --> 02:43:02.330]  On the Banking Committee for 17 years, and was involved in these investigations, and to just write it off and say, this is, I've never heard it.
[02:43:02.350 --> 02:43:15.103]  You know, when he said that, it sort of reminded me about, you know, the debates when the mayor, you know, shouted, and I can't believe this stuff, you know.
[02:43:15.804 --> 02:43:16.585]  What are you saying?
[02:43:17.651 --> 02:43:18.351]  It's incredible.
[02:43:18.592 --> 02:43:20.693]  We've only got four minutes left with Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:43:20.713 --> 02:43:22.594]  We appreciate him joining us live today.
[02:43:23.334 --> 02:43:30.939]  The New York Times is reporting they may try to revive the carbon tax with a direct tax on fuel at the refinery.
[02:43:31.059 --> 02:43:36.943]  Senate trio hopes to hit pay dirt with carbon fee at the oil company's request.
[02:43:37.843 --> 02:43:40.425]  Where is the carbon tax going as well as health care?
[02:43:41.101 --> 02:43:49.408]  Well, it's hard for me to believe they'll do that, even though it's alive and they want to, and that's their goal, and they will if they can.
[02:43:49.948 --> 02:43:56.234]  But under these conditions, it's so bad of an idea, it just blows my mind to think that they'll pursue that.
[02:43:56.254 --> 02:44:04.921]  So I don't know the details on whether that's going to go through or not, but I can guarantee you there's plenty up here who still believe in it and will pursue it.
[02:44:05.081 --> 02:44:09.065]  But I hope they come to their senses and realize how detrimental it would be.
[02:44:09.775 --> 02:44:13.358]  There's a Mary Landrieu quote in here saying, we need to pass this.
[02:44:13.418 --> 02:44:15.060]  This is going to help Americans.
[02:44:15.740 --> 02:44:16.561]  I mean, how bizarre.
[02:44:16.621 --> 02:44:18.263]  More taxes, people are going bankrupt.
[02:44:18.803 --> 02:44:25.829]  In closing, Congressman, we've now discovered that an Obama campaign operative has founded a coffee party.
[02:44:26.190 --> 02:44:32.735]  I actually had this idea with listeners two months ago to get real constitutionalists to take the tea parties back from the neocons.
[02:44:33.816 --> 02:44:45.204]  Now it turns out Obama picked up this idea and that his campaign operatives are now getting all this media attention to tell us to love our federal government, that it's our federal government.
[02:44:45.525 --> 02:44:56.012]  I mean, that shows how powerful the Tea Parties are, if not just the Republican establishment, but now the Democrats are flooding in trying to pose as patriots.
[02:44:58.055 --> 02:44:59.596]  Yeah, they want us to love the government.
[02:44:59.616 --> 02:45:02.899]  How about loving our country and understanding what freedom is all about?
[02:45:02.919 --> 02:45:17.131]  But the battle we have out there, I mean, one thing is they're starting to recognize that the battle may be outside of the conventional wisdom of Republicans and Democrats that run Washington and actually the discussion going on in the independent Tea Party type movement.
[02:45:17.631 --> 02:45:25.738]  And there's no reason to think that everybody is going to believe the right thing and get together and do the right thing in those who are objecting.
[02:45:26.158 --> 02:45:39.592]  But anybody who's involved better realize that if a significant movement erupts like the Tea Party movement, there will be plenty left and right, and everybody else who has a special interest will want to get in and try to control it.
[02:45:40.014 --> 02:45:43.737]  Well, to see the establishment trying to pose as anti-establishment is truly sickening.
[02:45:43.777 --> 02:45:46.019]  But, I mean, look at your 84% approval rating.
[02:45:46.059 --> 02:45:47.080]  People know the real McCoy.
[02:45:47.520 --> 02:45:48.261]  One minute left.
[02:45:48.701 --> 02:45:49.302]  The economy.
[02:45:49.342 --> 02:45:54.847]  A lot of top economists are now agreeing with you and others that we may have a mega-depression in the next 16 months.
[02:45:54.887 --> 02:46:01.012]  And they're positioning the IMF and World Bank with a new global constitution where they will pose as saviors again.
[02:46:01.312 --> 02:46:05.676]  How concerned are you that this recession could get a lot worse?
[02:46:06.124 --> 02:46:17.675]  Well, I think it is going to get a lot worse, and what is happening now is Wall Street's recovered and a few companies have recovered, but the unemployment rate is still very high and getting worse.
[02:46:18.375 --> 02:46:29.786]  And there will be plans, I'm sure they've been talking about it for quite a few years, because those who run the international banking system know that they're in trouble, so they are laying plans for this.
[02:46:30.738 --> 02:46:39.784]  People do ask me about, well, do you think this will bring on the North American Union and, you know, North American currency?
[02:46:39.804 --> 02:46:41.045]  And I really don't think so.
[02:46:41.065 --> 02:46:48.090]  I think the bigger concern should be a worldwide currency and the IMF and the United Nations grabbing hold and trying to dictate to us.
[02:46:48.310 --> 02:46:57.976]  But we have economic laws on our side because, you know, you can propose these things and even if it does serve the special interest, if it violates economic law, it won't work.
[02:46:57.996 --> 02:47:00.218]  So they can't maintain a good currency.
[02:47:00.598 --> 02:47:03.599]  And that's why I think the European Union is very, very fragile.
[02:47:03.659 --> 02:47:07.220]  Not only the Euro, but the Union as well, because it's artificial.
[02:47:07.500 --> 02:47:12.042]  And I think that's what would happen on a world government and a world currency.
[02:47:12.362 --> 02:47:22.225]  But in the meantime, it could get pretty messy, and they're going to work very hard to get organized, which means they'll work hard to undermine our personal liberties.
[02:47:22.921 --> 02:47:23.321]  All right.
[02:47:24.323 --> 02:47:40.900]  That's most of the interview I did with Ron Paul live earlier, but he wasn't with us for 30 minutes, but a vote came up, so I went live right at the start of the hour in the first five minutes, and I know some stations don't carry that, and he talked about such incredibly weighty issues that I wanted to go back over that.
[02:47:42.250 --> 02:47:49.874]  I have articles here where Germany, that pretty much runs the EU, is saying, we're not going to help Greece with any other loans.
[02:47:50.534 --> 02:47:55.436]  Now Goldman Sachs goes in, they're the key manager for the private central banks, a decade ago.
[02:47:56.597 --> 02:48:01.519]  And they tell Greece how to create a double set of books, this is now even in Reuters.
[02:48:02.440 --> 02:48:04.381]  They tell them how to invest in derivatives.
[02:48:05.512 --> 02:48:14.616]  Which internal documents that came out last year in McClatchy News Service prove they premeditatedly did it here in Iceland and Greece and Spain and a bunch of other nations.
[02:48:15.297 --> 02:48:23.720]  It's the same thing the IMF and World Bank do as the holding companies for these private brokerage firms and banks in the third world in the last 150 years.
[02:48:24.101 --> 02:48:27.602]  They go in, they give the government a bunch of money at 30-40% compounding interest.
[02:48:30.182 --> 02:48:37.569]  And they tell them, in the internal agreements that have come out, don't pay this back, and then you're going to give us your water, your roads, your infrastructures, your government.
[02:48:38.290 --> 02:48:43.154]  And then it doesn't matter who gets in office after that, or if it's a dictator or whatever the case is,
[02:48:44.557 --> 02:48:49.341]  The banks now run it, and they do this out of fiat money backed up by U.S.
[02:48:49.441 --> 02:48:50.802]  and European taxpayer money.
[02:48:51.083 --> 02:49:06.115]  Now this new banking system that they're setting up, this Bank of the World, this new constitution of and by the banks, they will break their bonds with even Western governments, who they're now imploding like third world nations, and issue their own global-backed currencies.
[02:49:06.135 --> 02:49:10.179]  They'll still have a euro, still have a dollar, still have a yen and a yon, but globally
[02:49:10.859 --> 02:49:14.321]  This private banking cartel will set the value of those currencies.
[02:49:14.701 --> 02:49:23.985]  Then they can play them off against each other and their own internal documents show, came out in 2002, IMF World Bank documents got leaked when Stiklitz left, Nobel Prize winner.
[02:49:25.006 --> 02:49:28.067]  That Economist World Bank was an IMF.
[02:49:28.107 --> 02:49:30.908]  The point is, documents from both banks talking to each other came out.
[02:49:31.509 --> 02:49:34.650]  Look up Stiklitz, he was IMF Chief Economist, wasn't it?
[02:49:35.791 --> 02:49:38.292]  Point is, that it came out
[02:49:40.185 --> 02:49:45.189]  That it was all premeditated and they set this up in third world countries and we're now planning to do it in the West.
[02:49:46.150 --> 02:49:52.475]  In Iceland, they claim they owe ten times or more the entire GDP and wealth of the nation.
[02:49:53.436 --> 02:50:02.843]  Then Iceland said no and the bankers said, oh wait a minute, don't kick us completely out after we threatened you and threatened to use anti-terror laws on you internationally to put sanctions on you.
[02:50:03.364 --> 02:50:03.764]  Guess what?
[02:50:03.784 --> 02:50:06.967]  It turns out our banks have assets in your country already that'll pay this off.
[02:50:08.413 --> 02:50:17.781]  Well, when Greece went under by design, they openly put in, as their new banking minister, a Goldman Sachs executive.
[02:50:18.922 --> 02:50:20.503]  That's the key group managing all this.
[02:50:20.543 --> 02:50:24.807]  They all make money off of it, but that's the key inner criminal circle managing it.
[02:50:25.427 --> 02:50:31.452]  And Europe's saying, we're not gonna give you any money to bail you out.
[02:50:31.492 --> 02:50:35.416]  You must give your private, you must give your government islands
[02:50:37.031 --> 02:50:38.192]  To the banks.
[02:50:38.873 --> 02:50:41.235]  And so, Greece is being fully stripped.
[02:50:41.676 --> 02:50:42.757]  Their people are rioting.
[02:50:43.437 --> 02:50:46.180]  Same thing is happening in Indonesia.
[02:50:46.340 --> 02:50:48.842]  They know what it means when the government bails out banks.
[02:50:49.183 --> 02:50:50.224]  They know it's a robbery.
[02:50:51.485 --> 02:50:52.786]  Because they've been through this before.
[02:50:52.806 --> 02:50:54.528]  We're going to continue breaking this down.
[02:50:54.848 --> 02:50:55.969]  Because this is the main issue.
[02:50:56.049 --> 02:50:56.990]  This is the top issue.
[02:50:57.030 --> 02:50:57.451]  Straight ahead.
[02:51:00.382 --> 02:51:01.783]  Is it safe to breathe anymore?
[02:51:02.043 --> 02:51:13.130]  Crowded public places, global pandemics and news reports of potential new strains of bacteria and viruses make you wonder, what if there was a germ killing nasal spray that acted almost like hand sanitizer for your nose?
[02:51:13.470 --> 02:51:14.070]  There is!
[02:51:14.431 --> 02:51:18.173]  It's called Sinofresh homeopathic nasal spray and it's a proven germ killer.
[02:51:18.513 --> 02:51:26.721]  Cynofresh is a revolutionary doctor recommended nasal spray that kills a broad spectrum of viruses, bacteria, molds and fungi on contact in your nose.
[02:51:27.102 --> 02:51:34.949]  Cynofresh causes no drug interactions, no loss of smell, no rebound congestion, contains no alcohol, is non-habit forming and is safe for daily use.
[02:51:35.269 --> 02:51:37.732]  Cynofresh must be a part of your family survival plan.

[02:51:56.545 --> 02:51:57.106]  It works.
[02:52:00.131 --> 02:52:03.780]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:04.161 --> 02:52:07.168]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:07.409 --> 02:52:08.832]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:52:09.528 --> 02:52:12.169]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:12.189 --> 02:52:18.392]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:18.573 --> 02:52:23.615]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:23.635 --> 02:52:33.760]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:33.880 --> 02:52:35.982]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:36.222 --> 02:52:37.563]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:37.824 --> 02:52:40.086]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:40.266 --> 02:52:42.107]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:42.408 --> 02:52:47.212]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:47.552 --> 02:52:56.660]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:52:59.298 --> 02:53:00.198]  Global meltdowns.
[02:53:00.539 --> 02:53:01.579]  Massive unemployment.
[02:53:01.959 --> 02:53:02.739]  Endless wars.
[02:53:03.160 --> 02:53:04.420]  A new currency crisis.
[02:53:04.820 --> 02:53:06.561]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[02:53:06.901 --> 02:53:08.742]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[02:53:09.042 --> 02:53:10.683]  So what's the best way to get ready?
[02:53:10.943 --> 02:53:12.644]  To get prepared for hard times ahead.
[02:53:13.024 --> 02:53:14.625]  Introducing Off The Grid News.
[02:53:15.005 --> 02:53:20.367]  A weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly
[02:53:23.410 --> 02:53:24.151]  We're good to go.
[02:53:53.390 --> 02:53:56.633]  Joseph Stiklitz was the chief economist at the World Bank.
[02:53:56.654 --> 02:53:57.595]  Okay.
[02:54:02.219 --> 02:54:05.143]  Here's an article out of
[02:54:18.732 --> 02:54:19.272]  Germany.
[02:54:19.853 --> 02:54:25.275]  German Member of Parliament suggests cash-strapped Greece should sell islands.
[02:54:26.136 --> 02:54:30.378]  There's another headline here where German government says no aid to Greece.
[02:54:30.518 --> 02:54:31.478]  They will go under.
[02:54:31.918 --> 02:54:41.683]  And the banks will come in and get everything on pennies on the dollar out of fiat currency they loaned them and derivatives that Goldman Sachs set them up under.
[02:54:41.983 --> 02:54:43.204]  And their people are rioting.
[02:54:44.853 --> 02:55:01.404]  That's the future of the United States and all these politicians are now out on the news saying we're going to have a Great Depression and everything's going to fall apart in the next 16 months if we don't give ultimate power over to these private banks and pass the carbon tax to fund it and all these other taxes.
[02:55:02.145 --> 02:55:03.206]  Here's philly.com.
[02:55:04.346 --> 02:55:07.208]  Taxes on soft drinks or any sweet drink.
[02:55:08.649 --> 02:55:10.190]  I mean it just goes on and on.
[02:55:10.270 --> 02:55:11.531]  Taxes on food.
[02:55:12.432 --> 02:55:13.673]  Taxes on everything.
[02:55:15.276 --> 02:55:30.244]  Meanwhile, you've got the scammer Al Gore caught in unmitigated fraud and lies about sea levels, dying penguins and polar bears, global warming, caught red-handed in fraud, just like they gave a peace prize to Obama expanding all these wars as part of a sick joke.
[02:55:30.885 --> 02:55:34.567]  UT, University of Tennessee, to give him honorary degree.
[02:55:35.267 --> 02:55:36.748]  Oh, thank you for lying to us.
[02:55:36.768 --> 02:55:39.409]  Thank you for making a billion dollars off your scam so far.
[02:55:39.829 --> 02:55:41.430]  Thank you for wanting to destroy U.S.
[02:55:41.490 --> 02:55:41.891]  industry.
[02:55:42.791 --> 02:55:44.292]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[02:55:44.332 --> 02:55:45.934]  It just gets more and more ridiculous.
[02:55:45.974 --> 02:55:47.635]  We have to despise these people.
[02:55:47.996 --> 02:55:49.337]  We have to expose them.
[02:55:49.797 --> 02:55:51.098]  We have to reveal them.
[02:55:51.539 --> 02:55:58.445]  We have to let the people understand just how serious this tyrannical takeover is.
[02:55:59.980 --> 02:56:01.341]  The public knows they're in pain.
[02:56:01.681 --> 02:56:03.682]  They know they're losing their jobs and getting pay cuts.
[02:56:03.722 --> 02:56:05.302]  They know the economy's falling apart.
[02:56:05.803 --> 02:56:14.386]  And on top of the depression that these banks engineered, they can't get the Congress to pass their carbon taxes, so they're just coming to the county level, city level, state level.
[02:56:15.147 --> 02:56:17.128]  They're having Obama, through the regulations, do it.
[02:56:18.548 --> 02:56:20.189]  This is outrageous, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:20.229 --> 02:56:24.371]  They think you're so stupid they announced, we're watching you over your laptops without warrants at home.
[02:56:25.219 --> 02:56:26.079]  Your school children.
[02:56:26.120 --> 02:56:27.120]  We're spying on you.
[02:56:27.160 --> 02:56:29.501]  We're reading your license plates everywhere you go.
[02:56:29.742 --> 02:56:30.822]  We're building more prisons.
[02:56:30.842 --> 02:56:31.863]  We're hiring more police.
[02:56:32.083 --> 02:56:35.064]  The federal government grew by 15% in the last month.
[02:56:35.625 --> 02:56:36.845]  It tripled under Bush.
[02:56:37.166 --> 02:56:40.107]  It quadrupled under Obama the first year.
[02:56:40.207 --> 02:56:45.390]  More money than all the government spent in the 235 years previous to that.
[02:56:45.590 --> 02:56:46.611]  That's an official number.
[02:56:47.831 --> 02:56:49.412]  They're going for broke.
[02:56:49.532 --> 02:56:56.176]  Once you've committed this many crimes, once you've done this much unconstitutional, lawless crap, why not make us go through naked body scanners?
[02:56:56.416 --> 02:56:57.957]  Why not stage terror attacks?
[02:56:58.277 --> 02:57:02.319]  Why not totally just throttle everyone and beat them into submission?
[02:57:02.579 --> 02:57:03.500]  What comes next?
[02:57:05.762 --> 02:57:08.385]  They're quietly training police for martial law nationwide.
[02:57:08.425 --> 02:57:10.147]  It's coming out in mainstream newspapers everywhere.
[02:57:10.167 --> 02:57:12.409]  They've got military running checkpoints all over the country.
[02:57:12.429 --> 02:57:13.590]  From Texas to California.
[02:57:13.871 --> 02:57:14.852]  From Michigan to Florida.
[02:57:15.052 --> 02:57:17.414]  They're openly training an NLEO-9 with FEMA.
[02:57:17.675 --> 02:57:20.317]  Trips from 14 countries to take on American citizens.
[02:57:20.938 --> 02:57:26.524]  All of this unspeakable stuff is now not conspiracy theory because insiders were warning us decades ago.
[02:57:26.784 --> 02:57:28.306]  It's now out in the open!
[02:57:30.447 --> 02:57:33.569]  And you have a decision to make.
[02:57:33.849 --> 02:57:35.431]  Are you going quietly into the night?
[02:57:35.631 --> 02:57:36.851]  Are you going to go along with this?
[02:57:36.892 --> 02:57:42.575]  Are you going to not have enough respect for yourself to realize that you are the leaders we need out there?
[02:57:42.635 --> 02:57:43.496]  You know you're good.
[02:57:43.536 --> 02:57:44.617]  You know you're pure of heart.
[02:57:44.957 --> 02:57:46.038]  You know you're honorable.
[02:57:46.098 --> 02:57:47.699]  You know you're anti-New World Order.
[02:57:48.039 --> 02:57:51.342]  You need to start websites, make your own films, access TV.
[02:57:52.182 --> 02:57:56.348]  Broker time on local radio, put out newsletters, go to city council.
[02:57:56.589 --> 02:57:58.391]  Everybody doing a little something.
[02:57:58.732 --> 02:58:00.955]  Everybody that calls me wants to do some big grand plan.
[02:58:01.035 --> 02:58:01.275]  No.
[02:58:01.736 --> 02:58:05.221]  It's lots of little actions that are going to defeat and bring these people down.
[02:58:06.121 --> 02:58:08.744]  We had Larry Pratt on with some very serious gun-grabbing news.
[02:58:09.124 --> 02:58:10.446]  Then Ron Paul, of course, was on.
[02:58:10.466 --> 02:58:12.087]  Jason Verma's on the Cybersecurity Act.
[02:58:12.468 --> 02:58:14.950]  And a lot more that'll re-air on AM and FM's across the country.
[02:58:14.970 --> 02:58:16.152]  I want to thank all of our affiliates.

[02:58:44.221 --> 02:58:46.343]  We're exponentially growing, but it's not fast enough.
[02:58:46.363 --> 02:58:47.804]  I'm risking my life doing this.
[02:58:47.825 --> 02:58:48.145]  Help us.
[02:58:48.625 --> 02:58:50.187]  One major world crisis away.
