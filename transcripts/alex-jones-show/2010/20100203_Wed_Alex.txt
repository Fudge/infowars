[00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:02.610]  ...media, government cover-ups.
[00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.071]  You want answers?
[00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:05.751]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:10.113]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:10.573 --> 00:00:14.615]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:16.889 --> 00:00:20.971]  Wolfgang Wodarg is our guest for at least the next 30 minutes.
[00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:23.111]  A very busy individual.
[00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:25.112]  We are honored to have him.
[00:00:25.152 --> 00:00:27.373]  This is a major news-making interview.
[00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:30.474]  He is the head of health at the Council of Europe.
[00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:37.952]  And we have the 47 nation body now investigating falsified swine flu pandemic.
[00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:49.855]  Health ministers and officials being on the payroll worldwide in different countries to push the fear, the dangerous nature of the vaccine, all the deaths that were caused in the trials a few years ago of the bird flu.
[00:00:50.176 --> 00:00:51.756]  He's investigating it all.
[00:00:52.256 --> 00:00:52.997]  We salute him.
[00:00:53.037 --> 00:00:55.099]  They've been having their investigation the last few weeks.
[00:00:55.419 --> 00:00:59.724]  So here to break it down for us is Dr. Wolfgang Wudarg.
[00:01:00.024 --> 00:01:03.248]  And sir, we really appreciate you coming on with us today.
[00:01:03.888 --> 00:01:05.410]  Thank you that I can be with you today.
[00:01:07.532 --> 00:01:14.820]  Again, tell us just basically about the Health Council of Europe, why you started your investigation, what your investigation is finding.
[00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:25.525]  Yes, I'm a physician myself and I was director for many years of a public health institution in northern Germany, observing the flu waves coming every year.
[00:01:25.545 --> 00:01:28.390]  And as my region has about 120,000 inhabitants,
[00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:39.742]  I used to count about 10% of the population getting ill with a flu and something or symptoms of a flu almost every year.
[00:01:40.222 --> 00:01:54.327]  So when I observed this, what we heard last April about Mexico City, a region with 20 million people, I was very much astonished that there were only 1000 cases when somebody already spoke about pandemic.
[00:01:54.727 --> 00:02:00.509]  I didn't understand it because in my small town we had more people getting ill within one or two weeks.
[00:02:00.962 --> 00:02:04.147]  From from the influencer to when there was an influencer.
[00:02:04.748 --> 00:02:10.457]  And so I started investigating and I found out that this was due to a change of definition.
[00:02:10.477 --> 00:02:13.902]  WHO had changed the definition what a pandemic is.
[00:02:14.628 --> 00:02:41.645]  Me, as a public health doctor, I learned that a pandemic is something spreading very fast, but as the flu always spreads every year very fast, or as fast as the planes fly, so this was nothing new, and a pandemic which is really worthwhile an alarm or an alert reaction of the people of this world, this is a pandemic which has serious diseases, which goes along with very high mortality, with many deaths and
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.182]  So when I heard about the Mexican cases, I was curious why they did this because it didn't give any sense.
[00:02:48.202 --> 00:02:50.163]  There was nothing extraordinary.
[00:02:50.223 --> 00:02:51.404]  There were mild cases.
[00:02:51.424 --> 00:02:53.545]  It was not even a new virus.
[00:02:53.665 --> 00:02:57.326]  This was obvious very soon because elder people didn't get ill.
[00:02:57.406 --> 00:02:59.427]  People older than 60 almost didn't get ill.
[00:02:59.727 --> 00:03:09.351]  And this is a very clear indication for that they have already been vaccinated with a similar virus or that they have been infected with a similar virus some years ago or many years ago.
[00:03:09.871 --> 00:03:11.212]  So this is
[00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:13.954]  So I didn't understand why this happened.
[00:03:16.215 --> 00:03:19.276]  And now you've had a chance to begin your investigation.
[00:03:19.796 --> 00:03:21.537]  When did the council start looking at this?
[00:03:21.997 --> 00:03:36.064]  Yeah, the council decided in the middle of last of the December on the 11th of December and last year there was a session on the Committee of Social Affairs and Health in Paris and we
[00:03:37.076 --> 00:04:00.392]  We had an anonymous decision that we want an urgent debate on the topic because we wanted to reinstall trust in the WHO because the population in Europe is very much astonished about this agency because they advised us twice, now at least twice, and they told us there would be a big threat for health.
[00:04:00.452 --> 00:04:02.014]  It was the bird flu where they said
[00:04:02.938 --> 00:04:08.301]  Thousands of people may be dead and they said it now the same way with the swine flu.
[00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:23.950]  So we want to reinstall health and we want to reinstall trust in this WHO and this is why we wanted an urgent debate and we are 47 countries and in this Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe we have all the parliamentarians.
[00:04:24.724 --> 00:04:27.726]  We have the national parliamentarians from 47 countries.
[00:04:28.146 --> 00:04:29.807]  We have the opposition parliamentarians.
[00:04:29.827 --> 00:04:31.408]  We have the governing parties there.
[00:04:31.869 --> 00:04:40.994]  So if you transport a topic to this platform, you can be sure that there is a discussion 47 times in the different nations.
[00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:42.055]  Okay, doctor.
[00:04:42.595 --> 00:04:44.196]  Doctor, not to interrupt, but we have to break.
[00:04:44.857 --> 00:04:47.218]  Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg is our guest.
[00:04:47.698 --> 00:04:49.460]  He's the head of the Health Council of Europe.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.062]  We're going to break down what they found, and it's incredible, on the other side.
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.684]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:04:59.024 --> 00:05:02.047]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:05:02.287 --> 00:05:07.052]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:05:07.072 --> 00:05:13.358]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:05:13.478 --> 00:05:15.721]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:05:16.241 --> 00:05:17.642]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:05:17.682 --> 00:05:18.383]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:05:18.403 --> 00:05:20.505]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:05:35.137 --> 00:05:36.978]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:42.122]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:05:42.422 --> 00:05:51.549]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:05:59.065 --> 00:06:01.789]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:07.457]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.

[00:06:54.246 --> 00:06:56.847]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:06:57.247 --> 00:07:02.209]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.310]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:09.432]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:07:09.633 --> 00:07:10.593]  How much do you want?
[00:07:10.813 --> 00:07:11.553]  When do you want it?
[00:07:11.934 --> 00:07:13.534]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:07:13.814 --> 00:07:14.635]  When will you need it?
[00:07:14.895 --> 00:07:16.956]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:07:17.096 --> 00:07:18.196]  Will there be any food?
[00:07:18.436 --> 00:07:19.737]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:07:20.077 --> 00:07:22.340]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.023]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:07:25.223 --> 00:07:28.407]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:07:28.808 --> 00:07:32.312]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:07:32.633 --> 00:07:33.614]  How much will you need?
[00:07:33.874 --> 00:07:34.475]  We don't know.
[00:07:34.755 --> 00:07:35.676]  How much do you want?
[00:07:35.877 --> 00:07:36.598]  All you can get.
[00:07:36.618 --> 00:07:37.599]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:40.642]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:07:40.922 --> 00:07:43.104]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:43.124 --> 00:07:44.185]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:07:44.245 --> 00:07:47.588]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:47.608 --> 00:07:48.529]  Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg.
[00:08:04.673 --> 00:08:09.437]  Has been the head of health for the Council of Europe until late last month.
[00:08:09.757 --> 00:08:12.559]  Now he rotated off that post and is still an honorary member of it.
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.022]  Now he's a private citizen medical doctor who can now speak about this.
[00:08:16.442 --> 00:08:18.204]  They've been investigating it since last year.
[00:08:18.224 --> 00:08:23.048]  They've now started the formal investigation from a week and a half ago.
[00:08:23.428 --> 00:08:31.534]  And we have the quotes here from the resolution about Big Pharma pushing this, most of the White House here.
[00:08:32.375 --> 00:08:36.878]  The scientific experts on the payroll, they talk about it being a dangerous vaccine.
[00:08:36.918 --> 00:08:39.780]  The German government wouldn't take it, wouldn't give it to the troops.
[00:08:41.001 --> 00:08:43.202]  Our media lied and said there wasn't mercury in it.
[00:08:44.623 --> 00:08:48.105]  And of course it killed a fraction of those what the regular flu does.
[00:08:48.426 --> 00:08:49.466]  So that's what they're looking at.
[00:08:50.527 --> 00:08:55.514]  In that first segment, doctor, we got up to the point of the formal investigation starting.
[00:08:56.015 --> 00:08:59.239]  What did you guys hear in testimony in the last few weeks?
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:05.508]  And then break down personally some of the statements you've made, the research of what this appears to be.
[00:09:06.414 --> 00:09:34.135]  Yeah, we had the WHO was present in the first edition and there will be a report which will be finished in June and there will be recommendations for our member governments how to handle this problem in future because we have seen that the government had to order or ordered a lot of vaccines and they were obliged, they made marketing commitments with pharmaceutical companies because they were threatened by specialists, by scientists that there could be something very dangerous coming and
[00:09:34.935 --> 00:09:50.723]  So they just made those contracts, and within those contracts, which were secret, which we could not see as parliamentarians, there was written that the WHO was at the trigger to say, this is a pandemic, and if they say it, then the whole business was on, and they had to take the vaccines for pandemic use.
[00:09:51.304 --> 00:09:57.667]  And this was about $18 billion worldwide value, and this is a lot of money in health.
[00:09:58.157 --> 00:10:15.452]  So we were wondering, because of this mild flu, how such an enormous waste of money could happen and how millions of people could have been vaccinated parallelly to the seasonal vaccination, so it's a double vaccination, without any
[00:10:16.705 --> 00:10:18.146]  Scientific evidence to do so.
[00:10:18.526 --> 00:10:26.249]  And there is Poland, for instance, where the health minister, she's experienced in public health, and she said, no, we don't buy this vaccine.
[00:10:26.549 --> 00:10:28.049]  And the Polish now are very well off.
[00:10:28.109 --> 00:10:29.050]  They are not vaccinated.
[00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:30.010]  They didn't spend the money.
[00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.511]  And in other nations, the people didn't trust.
[00:10:32.731 --> 00:10:38.953]  The French, for instance, they bought for 90% of the population, they bought vaccines and only 6% took the vaccine.
[00:10:39.434 --> 00:10:40.454]  It's similar in Germany.
[00:10:41.104 --> 00:10:42.686]  And nevertheless, people are well off.
[00:10:42.926 --> 00:10:44.287]  This was the mildest flu ever.
[00:10:44.808 --> 00:10:48.411]  And the people were much clever, much more clever than the government.
[00:10:48.511 --> 00:10:50.954]  So we have to find out what was going on with WHO.
[00:10:51.014 --> 00:10:53.416]  Why did they do this pandemic alarm?
[00:10:53.856 --> 00:10:59.282]  And we found out that there is a public-private partnership within WHO, which developed the last 10 years.
[00:10:59.802 --> 00:11:14.637]  And which the very powerful pharmaceutical companies seem to have used quite well for them, for their purpose, for their shareholders, because the decisions there were the reason why they now earn so much money with this vaccine.
[00:11:15.278 --> 00:11:17.620]  And we don't know what really happened.
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:20.343]  We only know that they changed the definition of pandemic.
[00:11:21.235 --> 00:11:24.718]  Which was a very dangerous thing before and now it's just a normal flu.
[00:11:24.778 --> 00:11:29.861]  It's called a pandemic and this is the reason why the business for pharmaceutical companies was open.
[00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:44.440]  Well, Doctor, looking at this, and again we're talking to the former head, he just left his post, regular rotation off of it, last month as the head of the Health Council of Europe.
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:49.884]  I still go on cooperating with my colleague and working on this matter very intensely.
[00:11:49.904 --> 00:11:50.765]  So you're still part of it.
[00:11:52.486 --> 00:11:58.991]  My point is this, so out of the gates, and we noticed this, they changed the definition of a pandemic.
[00:12:01.502 --> 00:12:06.446]  Because they knew that it was very mild and wasn't a pandemic by the old measurement, not even near.
[00:12:06.886 --> 00:12:11.210]  So, out of the gates, we know that that is fraud.
[00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:25.261]  And then in the reports I've been reading, the council and yourself have been talking about that the vaccine wasn't properly tested, was approved without testing, thanks to government's declarations of emergency.
[00:12:25.581 --> 00:12:28.924]  That's why they went with the pandemic designation, correct?
[00:12:29.164 --> 00:12:36.885]  Yes, too, because if the pharmaceutical companies wanted to have a real business, they have a monopole on the vaccines.
[00:12:36.925 --> 00:12:44.607]  And this is what they tried by using new vaccines, using adjuvants, using new technologies to breed the virus for the vaccine.
[00:12:45.207 --> 00:12:47.647]  And this were patented methods.
[00:12:47.807 --> 00:12:58.449]  So they could monopolize it and tell the government that this was a pandemic vaccine, a special one which they can produce more quickly than normally.
[00:12:58.882 --> 00:12:59.162]  Okay.
[00:12:59.182 --> 00:12:59.403]  Go ahead.
[00:12:59.423 --> 00:12:59.703]  Go ahead.
[00:13:13.966 --> 00:13:34.637]  Normally you can if you have the virus which is to come you make a mixture of certain viruses you expect to come and there are so many facilities all over the world which would be able to produce non-patented vaccines everywhere very fast and very much adapted to the epidemiological situation but when you do this with a monopole when you have
[00:13:35.477 --> 00:13:41.239]  Such a small passage only and everything has to go through those few enterprises.
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.960]  It is not faster, it's not quicker.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.181]  And I think it is just the wrong pandemic plans we do.
[00:13:47.261 --> 00:13:49.562]  We should have no patents on vaccines.
[00:13:49.642 --> 00:13:51.183]  This is what we think politically.
[00:13:51.203 --> 00:13:53.264]  The Council of Europe already had a decision on this.
[00:13:53.324 --> 00:13:56.825]  We said there should be no patents, no monopoles possible.
[00:13:57.505 --> 00:13:59.747]  On life-saving vaccines.
[00:13:59.847 --> 00:14:07.553]  Because, doctor, doesn't that also incentivize the big pharma to engage in hype and hoaxes and fraud because it is a monetary driver?
[00:14:08.934 --> 00:14:23.165]  Yes, I think it is their trick that they always try to monopolize this and we pay much more like this if we would pay the scientists to find out the best vaccines and to develop the best vaccines.
[00:14:23.766 --> 00:14:28.530]  And let this do without patents and let them be copied all over the world very fast.
[00:14:29.131 --> 00:14:32.874]  The taxpayer would be much better off and it would be much cheaper.
[00:14:33.334 --> 00:14:38.358]  Now, Dr. Wolfgang Wudarg, I want to move quickly because I know your time is precious here and you're very busy.
[00:14:38.698 --> 00:14:48.567]  I have so many questions, but a thought that I just had when you mentioned the third world, they're already saying they're going to ship this throughout the year around the world
[00:14:49.187 --> 00:15:05.676]  When they admit that the virus has already mutated and is already even weakening more, and in six months a year it'll be absolutely worthless if it wasn't already worthless, and they're saying they're going to ship the unused vaccine, because the hoax failed, the people didn't take it en masse, to the third world.
[00:15:05.716 --> 00:15:09.478]  I mean, is that not manifest fraud on top of fraud right there?
[00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:12.561]  But there is no influence in the hot countries.
[00:15:13.182 --> 00:15:14.043]  They don't need it.
[00:15:14.463 --> 00:15:17.086]  And there is no influence in the Arctic, neither.
[00:15:17.386 --> 00:15:19.849]  The virus needs a certain climate to spread.
[00:15:20.316 --> 00:15:22.337]  And this is only in our regions in winter.
[00:15:22.757 --> 00:15:25.937]  And so we don't, the third world doesn't need it really.
[00:15:26.177 --> 00:15:28.658]  But I had a discussion yesterday with Japanese colleagues.
[00:15:29.138 --> 00:15:32.759]  And the Japanese, they are going to have the vaccination campaign in February.
[00:15:33.239 --> 00:15:34.540]  So they just will start now.
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:39.621]  And they know already that it is a very mild flu to come and there is no danger in it.
[00:15:39.921 --> 00:15:43.142]  But the Japan bought vaccines for 110 million people.
[00:15:44.862 --> 00:15:48.885]  And they cannot retire from this vaccine contract.
[00:15:49.365 --> 00:15:51.927]  So they are in a very, very big political dilemma now.
[00:15:52.367 --> 00:15:58.271]  And they have very big problems because the Japanese people, they already know it wouldn't be necessary to get vaccinated.
[00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:00.552]  What shall Japan do with all its vaccines?
[00:16:00.632 --> 00:16:08.154]  But that's my next issue, is this is destroying the credibility of the entire medical system when it is Big Pharma that is doing it.
[00:16:09.214 --> 00:16:15.676]  In the Council of Europe report, it is discussed that this is an untested, dangerous vaccine.
[00:16:15.716 --> 00:16:16.676]  Can you speak to that?
[00:16:17.076 --> 00:16:24.018]  Also, can you speak to the German military and government ministers being given a special additive-free vaccine?
[00:16:24.038 --> 00:16:25.678]  That isn't a very strong vote of confidence.
[00:16:26.098 --> 00:16:27.940]  Yeah, this is two points.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:37.387]  The first thing is that the pandemic vaccine is a pandemic vaccine and it was planned to be produced very fast, trust me.
[00:16:37.447 --> 00:16:44.893]  And so we have additives, adjuvants with it, and they are only tested with elderly people.
[00:16:44.933 --> 00:16:51.879]  This is why the FDA in the US didn't allow this vaccine to be used with children and younger people in the US.
[00:16:52.538 --> 00:16:53.118]  And so U.S.
[00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:57.901]  people population is well better protected against those side effects.
[00:16:58.361 --> 00:17:08.686]  But in Europe we just use them for children, for pregnant women and there are no clinic, there's no clinical testing has been done with children and with some of the vaccines.
[00:17:08.746 --> 00:17:11.467]  And there are other vaccines which you spoke about for soldiers.
[00:17:11.868 --> 00:17:16.330]  This is a vaccine which takes the whole virus and it is known to have more side effects.
[00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:20.352]  So it's not better than the one the rest of the population gets.
[00:17:20.792 --> 00:17:21.412]  Well, yes, sir.
[00:17:21.472 --> 00:17:24.193]  Doctor, we know what adjuvants did with the anthrax shot.
[00:17:24.233 --> 00:17:40.679]  The Pentagon suspended it because in young people, as you know, Doctor, the audience may not, when you give a young person who has a really strong immune system an adjuvant, it can trigger what the cytokine storm and have the lungs fill full of liquids similar to hemorrhagic fever, correct?
[00:17:42.359 --> 00:17:50.142]  I don't have the scientific evidence for this, but I know that the adjuvants, they stimulate the immune system enormously.
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:18:01.669]  And this may lead to a misfunction of the immune system, which means that there may be autoimmune diseases or allergic diseases result afterwards within those vaccinated people.
[00:18:01.689 --> 00:18:04.912]  Well, what about all the confirmed cases of Guillain-Barré?
[00:18:05.673 --> 00:18:09.336]  Guillain-Barré was there when they had this vaccine.
[00:18:11.598 --> 00:18:13.520]  It was in the U.S.
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.343]  when they stopped having this, and there is evidence for this.
[00:18:17.938 --> 00:18:26.521]  But what they use now is a new patent adjuvant and we don't have any evidence how the side effects of this will be.
[00:18:26.881 --> 00:18:30.823]  But this is the big risk and it would not be necessary to take this risk.
[00:18:32.264 --> 00:18:38.106]  I mean sure if the flu was killing tens of millions of people it might be if you can trust the shot but if it's a mild
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:45.482]  Bottom line, Doctor, you personally looking at the research, is this a giant hoax?
[00:18:46.022 --> 00:18:49.723]  We know they paid off most of the big health ministers to come out and fear monger.
[00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:51.363]  Is that not a conflict of interest?
[00:18:52.344 --> 00:18:54.304]  For sure it is a conflict of interest.
[00:18:54.644 --> 00:19:07.488]  Those people who are there for their shareholders, who have the interest of the pharmaceutical companies and to earn a lot of money, they have different reasons to decide and they decide differently than those people who are in charge of public health.
[00:19:07.992 --> 00:19:09.133]  Bottom line, it's a hoax.
[00:19:28.783 --> 00:19:29.684]  Unbelievable.
[00:19:29.764 --> 00:19:33.226]  Dr. Wolfgang Wudarg is our guest.
[00:19:33.246 --> 00:19:35.327]  We're going to give you his website when we come back.
[00:19:35.367 --> 00:19:40.711]  I'm going to try to twist his arm into staying maybe to 40 after, because we're going to have one five-minute segment when we come back.
[00:19:40.771 --> 00:19:42.732]  And I've got this huge list of questions.
[00:19:42.772 --> 00:19:47.635]  If it sounds like I'm interrupting you, doctor, it's just, I mean, you are such a great person.
[00:19:47.655 --> 00:19:51.298]  This council is doing such great work exposing this fraud.
[00:19:54.608 --> 00:19:58.869]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:20:59.228 --> 00:21:02.212]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:21:02.472 --> 00:21:07.279]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:21:07.819 --> 00:21:11.123]  Tremendous influence on our president and Congress.
[00:21:11.744 --> 00:21:13.465]  And they really are calling the shots.
[00:21:13.646 --> 00:21:18.669]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us, as American citizens, to pay attention.
[00:21:18.849 --> 00:21:21.952]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[00:21:22.112 --> 00:21:28.837]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:21:28.937 --> 00:21:31.059]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:21:31.299 --> 00:21:32.620]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.182]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:21:35.342 --> 00:21:37.183]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:39.005]  And right now in Washington, D.C.,
[00:21:39.705 --> 00:21:42.288]  We have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:23:57.045 --> 00:24:00.729]  Wolfgang Wudarg, Dr. Wolfgang Wudarg is our guest.
[00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:05.194]  It's wudarg.de is the website.
[00:24:05.214 --> 00:24:08.037]  We've got it up on screen at prisonplanet.tv for the viewers.
[00:24:08.437 --> 00:24:10.920]  Radio listeners can go to infowars.com and link over.
[00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.943]  We've got him until 40 after, graciously giving us a lot of time.
[00:24:14.424 --> 00:24:16.065]  He was the head of the investigation.
[00:24:16.886 --> 00:24:26.872]  For the 47-member nation, Bonnie, Council of Europe, Parliamentary Assembly over health, and they just had the start of the intense investigation.
[00:24:26.932 --> 00:24:34.237]  I want to get into that in the next segment, any new breaking info that came out, what you were told by Big Pharma that you had before you.
[00:24:34.277 --> 00:24:42.022]  But first, Doctor, you talk about the bird flu, and I have the Czech Republic news, I have the London Telegraph.
[00:24:43.202 --> 00:24:48.025]  Where they were mixing weaponized, very deadly, bird flu in.
[00:24:48.286 --> 00:24:50.667]  Thank God they found out it was killing the test animals.
[00:24:50.967 --> 00:24:54.850]  We have homeless people die after bird flu vaccine trial in Poland.
[00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:57.451]  Roughly 30% that were given it died.
[00:24:57.852 --> 00:25:00.273]  The media never said what big pharma company that was.
[00:25:00.353 --> 00:25:02.735]  You mentioned that, that hoax as well.
[00:25:03.435 --> 00:25:04.316]  Can you speak to that?
[00:25:05.573 --> 00:25:06.995]  I'm not so much in this matter.
[00:25:07.035 --> 00:25:20.915]  I only know that the enterprise of Baxter sent such stuff to 16 laboratories in Europe and that in Czech Republic they found out that it is a very dangerous mixture which they send and they
[00:25:21.682 --> 00:25:26.884]  It is said that they sent it by accident, but the enterprise doesn't declare anything.
[00:25:26.904 --> 00:25:30.365]  And as far as I know, there have been no parliamentary investigation.
[00:25:30.425 --> 00:25:33.486]  I think there should be a very deep and thorough investigation on this.
[00:25:33.966 --> 00:25:39.368]  What I know is there is some courts dealing with this, so we have to look at the single states.
[00:25:40.166 --> 00:25:40.506]  I think so.
[00:25:55.433 --> 00:26:00.858]  Are not very responsible and who are not very much bound to public interest and to public health.
[00:26:01.239 --> 00:26:02.219]  This is a dangerous thing.
[00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:08.906]  And if an enterprise which goes for money has such stuff, I think it is not.
[00:26:09.306 --> 00:26:10.147]  We should not allow this.
[00:26:12.242 --> 00:26:32.088]  I also saw a lot of top genetic engineers and scientists in the headlines, I would imagine you saw it doctor, saying this was clearly a manufactured, that the swine flu appeared to come out of nowhere in the wrong hemisphere, wrong time of year, and that it had a pedigree leading back to laboratories.
[00:26:32.848 --> 00:26:38.230]  It is a funny thing that it went like it went, and it is an unusual event which happened.
[00:26:38.909 --> 00:26:54.282]  And the blow-up, which was made very soon after the whole thing started, seems to be an indication that there were people already waiting for something to happen to use this, what happened, for their purposes.
[00:26:54.382 --> 00:26:55.123]  It looks like that.
[00:26:55.923 --> 00:26:57.925]  But we have to find out what really happened.
[00:26:57.945 --> 00:26:58.606]  I don't know it.
[00:26:59.306 --> 00:27:03.209]  Well, sir, you told me off-air you were aware of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:04.631]  I will send you today
[00:27:05.683 --> 00:27:16.925]  The secret Department of Cemetery document we got in January of 2009, and the clips of an emergency manager who we did not give his name, but we confirmed who he was.
[00:27:16.945 --> 00:27:19.026]  We interviewed him, others interviewed him.
[00:27:19.046 --> 00:27:23.187]  I interviewed him off-air, we had the reporter on who interviewed him with the newspaper dot com.
[00:27:24.067 --> 00:27:28.148]  In January, three months before the hype in Mexico City began,
[00:27:29.108 --> 00:27:39.555]  They went all over the U.S., from California, Illinois, New York, and I got the Bureau of Cemeteries, and said, millions will die, prepare for martial law.
[00:27:39.615 --> 00:27:42.237]  Now, it appears that that was done.
[00:27:42.337 --> 00:27:54.805]  Also, in April, got secret documents, Department of Health in Texas, where they told them we're really at level six, and that the government was scaring the locals, covertly, to create this fear.
[00:27:55.765 --> 00:28:01.827]  So, clearly, sir, we know, before it even popped up, in Mexico, that they were hyping this.
[00:28:02.567 --> 00:28:06.048]  I don't know whether your parliamentarians in your parliament, whether they are after this.
[00:28:06.068 --> 00:28:07.308]  They should be after this, too.
[00:28:07.728 --> 00:28:14.630]  Because when we have such information in parliament, normally the opposition goes for it.
[00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:19.551]  And the opposition tries to find out, and the parliamentarians have the right to investigate everything.
[00:28:20.051 --> 00:28:22.312]  Every door has to open if a parliamentarian comes.
[00:28:22.805 --> 00:28:24.127]  And it has to be made obvious.
[00:28:24.187 --> 00:28:25.408]  We have to see all the files.
[00:28:25.788 --> 00:28:28.872]  This is how we work normally in many countries of Europe.
[00:28:28.932 --> 00:28:30.474]  In Germany, I did this many times.
[00:28:31.155 --> 00:28:32.276]  And this should be done.
[00:28:32.396 --> 00:28:34.498]  There should be investigations.
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:41.146]  I think this is a very big and very severe suspicion we must have.
[00:28:42.867 --> 00:28:44.588]  We have to be sure.
[00:28:45.148 --> 00:28:51.650]  Well, sir, going back to the hoax, which you're agreeing, clearly it's a hoax, what was the point of the hoax?
[00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:58.173]  And we also know, again, all these different government ministers in health, a lot of them are on the payroll of these companies.
[00:28:59.373 --> 00:29:11.578]  I know about some countries that there are lists now of scientists who advised the Minister of Health, and those scientists are on the payroll of several companies.
[00:29:12.122 --> 00:29:19.007]  I know this about, I have information about France, I have information about Holland, I have information about in Britain.
[00:29:20.089 --> 00:29:37.614]  So, and my colleague, he will, from the Labour Party, a parliamentarian from Great Britain, who will continue to have these auditions done, he will invite them and he will try to get expertise and scientific evidence what really happened.
[00:29:37.994 --> 00:29:39.215]  Alright, gotta break, Doctor.
[00:29:39.495 --> 00:29:41.435]  Final segment with our guest.
[00:29:41.915 --> 00:29:43.976]  We'll talk about what they discovered in their investigation.
[00:29:44.276 --> 00:29:45.296]  We're on the march.
[00:29:45.676 --> 00:29:47.177]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:48.215 --> 00:29:51.036]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:53.837 --> 00:29:54.837]  What's your home worth?
[00:29:54.997 --> 00:29:56.938]  How can you compare local real estate agents?

[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:57.202]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:30:57.322 --> 00:31:00.083]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:31:00.203 --> 00:31:02.164]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:31:02.304 --> 00:31:04.425]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:31:04.525 --> 00:31:06.046]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:31:06.186 --> 00:31:10.528]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[00:31:31.124 --> 00:31:31.404]  We're good.
[00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:57.172]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:57.492 --> 00:31:58.093]  Number one.
[00:31:58.393 --> 00:32:01.554]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:01.814 --> 00:32:02.375]  Number two.
[00:32:02.675 --> 00:32:07.237]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:07.577 --> 00:32:08.037]  It's true.
[00:32:08.318 --> 00:32:12.860]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:13.721]  Number 3.
[00:32:14.001 --> 00:32:17.304]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:17.584 --> 00:32:21.287]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:21.508 --> 00:32:22.068]  Number 4.
[00:32:22.308 --> 00:32:24.670]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:25.071 --> 00:32:28.454]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:28.754 --> 00:32:28.954]  Number 5.
[00:32:29.535 --> 00:32:33.458]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:33.679 --> 00:32:38.443]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:38.723 --> 00:32:42.749]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:32:57.799 --> 00:33:00.521]  Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg is our guest.
[00:33:00.541 --> 00:33:02.742]  We've just got about eight minutes left with him today.
[00:33:02.762 --> 00:33:06.244]  His website is wodarg.de.
[00:33:06.644 --> 00:33:08.285]  W-O-D-A-R-G.
[00:33:08.425 --> 00:33:10.506]  Very honored to have him with us.
[00:33:10.546 --> 00:33:13.928]  He headed up the investigation for the 47-member Health Council of Europe.
[00:33:14.609 --> 00:33:15.089]  Okay, sir.
[00:33:15.389 --> 00:33:20.032]  Tell us, now that you've had official hearings on this, new information that you've discovered.
[00:33:20.052 --> 00:33:25.295]  You also told me during the break the connection between bird flu, swine flu, secret contracts.
[00:33:25.755 --> 00:33:26.816]  Why that is so important?
[00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:39.836]  Yeah, we had a first edition and the WHO representative was there and we asked him which reasons they had to change the definition of a pandemic.
[00:33:40.457 --> 00:33:42.978]  And he didn't give us scientific reasons.
[00:33:43.018 --> 00:33:46.300]  He just told us that the WHO is asking many scientists.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.701]  He told us the number of scientists, 138 scientists, he said, they were asking.
[00:33:48.761 --> 00:33:51.002]  And after this, they had changed the definition.
[00:33:56.127 --> 00:34:06.782]  But when you really see the press reports from that time, from the 19th of May, and we asked him this too, then you can see that there were
[00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:25.244]  Many member states urging the WHO not to use the new definition and Mr. Fukuda, who is the representative of WHO, who was present in Strasbourg, he told those member states of WHO, he told them, yes, we will have a deep thought on it.
[00:34:25.724 --> 00:34:28.687]  But then they met again with the pharmaceutical industry.
[00:34:29.327 --> 00:34:35.568]  And they just went on blindly using this unwanted pandemic definition.
[00:34:36.008 --> 00:34:42.630]  And this led to spending enormous amounts of money and this led to unnecessary vaccinations of millions of people.
[00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:58.813]  So I think this will be a very, very severe thing and very acute, very accusations we have against the WHO and against those pharmaceutical companies doing such an undue influence on the WHO decision.
[00:34:59.991 --> 00:35:06.336]  Well, Dr. Woodard, we know that they paid off ministers.
[00:35:06.436 --> 00:35:08.657]  We know they falsified the pandemic.
[00:35:09.118 --> 00:35:11.640]  We know they didn't get proper testing of the vaccine.
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:14.202]  We know they're making millions of dollars off of this.
[00:35:14.682 --> 00:35:17.184]  We know that bird flu trials killed a bunch of people.
[00:35:17.684 --> 00:35:23.889]  I mean, is this not a very serious criminal operation that we're investigating?
[00:35:24.912 --> 00:35:32.919]  I think we have to stop this entering of private firms, private pharmaceutical firms, to the public health institution.
[00:35:33.219 --> 00:35:37.302]  They should just leave this institution.
[00:35:37.322 --> 00:35:47.231]  They should have no influence on the decisions of the agency, of the public health agency, which is so important for protecting us against health threats worldwide.
[00:35:48.092 --> 00:36:02.826]  And this shall be one of our goals to give advice to our governments to go to the World Health Assembly and to say that WHO has to change its rules and that there has to be more transparency.
[00:36:03.226 --> 00:36:07.690]  This will be the result, I think, of our recommendations.
[00:36:07.771 --> 00:36:09.732]  This will be our recommendations to the member states.
[00:36:12.642 --> 00:36:14.322]  Well, we know that in the U.S.
[00:36:14.382 --> 00:36:18.563]  and Europe, especially the U.S., because I've really studied that area, perhaps you can fill us in on Europe.
[00:36:19.363 --> 00:36:27.585]  I mean, these are very draconian powers, and they tried to have forced inoculations in New York State and Massachusetts State.
[00:36:27.965 --> 00:36:32.246]  I saw some European Union member states try to say everyone must take it, it's the law.
[00:36:32.666 --> 00:36:39.967]  Isn't this a human rights issue, when the government in league with big pharma says you must take this experimental shot?
[00:36:40.683 --> 00:37:06.942]  Yes, the Council of Europe is a human rights institution, and this is why we deal with the matter, because the integrity of the body and the right to health is a very important fundamental right, which is touched, and it should not be touched by... If a doctor just does something because he wants to earn money, he is punished if he doesn't do it for the health of his patient, but he does it only for his pockets.
[00:37:07.426 --> 00:37:21.712]  So if an institution or if a big institution does decisions for money, and it's influenced by people who do it for money, this is a crime too, and I think we have to go after it as a human rights institution, and we will do it.
[00:37:23.715 --> 00:37:26.919]  Well, sir, we appreciate you joining us here today.
[00:37:26.999 --> 00:37:28.981]  My final question is this.
[00:37:29.041 --> 00:37:29.662]  It's two-part.
[00:37:30.463 --> 00:37:32.225]  What is the process on the report?
[00:37:32.605 --> 00:37:35.648]  Any other breaking news that came out of the preliminary hearings?
[00:37:36.189 --> 00:37:37.170]  So what is the process?
[00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:40.714]  Any new information, breaking news you'd like to relate to the world here?
[00:37:42.436 --> 00:37:43.938]  And when will the final report come out?
[00:37:45.046 --> 00:37:51.371]  I think the first, the last question I can answer the first is that there is no pandemic vaccination necessary.
[00:37:51.511 --> 00:37:56.975]  We know this now rather, we are very, very sure that it is not necessary.
[00:37:57.075 --> 00:38:02.539]  So the people were right in France, the people were right in Germany not to have this pandemic vaccination.
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:04.341]  This is the first and most important thing.
[00:38:05.282 --> 00:38:09.165]  And what will be the result of our investigation?
[00:38:09.965 --> 00:38:14.749]  We see that in many national parliaments, we have
[00:38:15.225 --> 00:38:25.470]  Special investigations, according to their institutes and their scientists now, so we are 47 nations, 47 parliaments, will do investigations.
[00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:34.734]  And what we do in the Council of Europe, we will be the platform for exchange of experience and we will foster this discussion in the national parliaments.
[00:38:35.214 --> 00:38:40.535]  And we try to feed them with information we get from WHO and from other institutions.
[00:38:41.815 --> 00:38:43.715]  We now collect all information.
[00:38:43.916 --> 00:38:50.997]  We are in this period that we collect many, many information about single scientists, single institutes, where they get their money from.
[00:38:51.417 --> 00:38:58.498]  And all this is now collected and we get a better and better mosaic, a better picture of what had happened.
[00:38:59.198 --> 00:39:04.459]  And this will be the report then and the recommendations will come out of it.
[00:39:06.084 --> 00:39:23.308]  Well, we know laws have been broken, some crimes have been committed, conflict of interest, but if this clear picture is confirmed, do you believe that there will be calls for indictments or criminal investigations, or does Big Pharma have too much control?
[00:39:24.228 --> 00:39:26.368]  There is no law for WHO.
[00:39:27.168 --> 00:39:30.189]  There is no one who punishes those people in WHO.
[00:39:30.822 --> 00:39:32.224]  We only have national law.
[00:39:32.725 --> 00:39:35.509]  So this is very important that we collect the information.
[00:39:36.029 --> 00:39:43.460]  And on the national level, we try to find those people responsible and we try to punish them there if they did something wrong.
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:46.364]  Because if we don't, they're just going to keep doing this over and over again.
[00:39:47.761 --> 00:39:55.369]  Yes, but this is the task of the governments, because the governments, they define the role of the WHO.
[00:39:55.610 --> 00:40:05.760]  It's a contract between the UN nations, and the UN nations, and the governments of those nations, they control the work of WHO, but it's the government, it's not the public.
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:08.243]  Will you be able to ever get those secret contracts?
[00:40:09.575 --> 00:40:14.658]  We got it in Germany, the French got it, and the national parliaments are now working to get all the contracts.
[00:40:14.918 --> 00:40:31.826]  The Japanese told me that they had no possibility to retire from their contract as we in Germany succeeded to do a little bit, so we negotiated with the pharmaceutical companies and they let us save a little bit of money from those almost 700 million euros they wanted first.
[00:40:33.965 --> 00:40:44.808]  It's very, very different from nation to nation and I just can tell my colleagues and just can ask my colleagues in all parliaments, go ahead, have investigations, have a deep look.
[00:40:45.188 --> 00:40:48.609]  We cannot tolerate such a development.
[00:40:48.669 --> 00:40:51.229]  We cannot have this the next winter again.
[00:40:51.249 --> 00:40:53.850]  We don't want such faked pandemics.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:58.303]  But the good news is, the court of public opinion, I've seen the numbers.
[00:40:58.363 --> 00:41:03.708]  This is record numbers of people not buying the hype, who are refusing to take the shots.
[00:41:04.088 --> 00:41:06.330]  And in the final equation, we're going to let you go, Doctor.
[00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:08.732]  Who are the real bad guys?
[00:41:08.772 --> 00:41:09.472]  Big Pharma?
[00:41:09.893 --> 00:41:13.195]  And are you saying the WHO is run by Big Pharma?
[00:41:14.436 --> 00:41:16.558]  The WHO has opened the door for Big Pharma.
[00:41:17.199 --> 00:41:23.481]  And the Big Pharma influences the WHO by scientists with institutes paid by Big Pharma.
[00:41:23.601 --> 00:41:28.842]  Scientists are dependent that the institutes get money from Big Pharma and the scientists go there.
[00:41:29.162 --> 00:41:31.763]  They do the clinical studies for Big Pharma on one hand.
[00:41:31.883 --> 00:41:36.764]  On the other hand, they go to WHO and say, you have to buy those pills to do such decisions.
[00:41:37.104 --> 00:41:40.705]  This is what the suspicion is and this cannot be tolerated.
[00:41:41.406 --> 00:41:42.786]  The public health institutions
[00:41:43.046 --> 00:41:46.627]  We have to be free from influence, from economic influence.
[00:41:46.967 --> 00:41:49.027]  It's about our health, it's not about business.
[00:41:49.087 --> 00:41:49.347]  Yeah.
[00:41:49.868 --> 00:42:00.250]  Well that's like Rick Perry, our governor, saying all girls must take the Gardasil shot, that they admits killed a bunch of people, and then that wasn't even a law, he just recommended it, but went on TV and said it was the law.
[00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:04.791]  Hoax after hoax, and it turned out most of his party got massive money from Merck.
[00:42:05.331 --> 00:42:10.775]  Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg, we appreciate Dr. Wodarg for joining us.
[00:42:10.875 --> 00:42:14.298]  Wodarg.de is the website.
[00:42:14.318 --> 00:42:15.959]  W-O-D-A-R-G.
[00:42:16.279 --> 00:42:17.880]  We appreciate you and your colleagues.
[00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:19.481]  Unanimous investigation.
[00:42:20.102 --> 00:42:24.565]  Unanimously agreeing this is a hoax and a fraud and expanding the investigation.
[00:42:24.825 --> 00:42:29.469]  We salute your courage, sir, and we'll continue to watch the investigation and the report.
[00:42:30.129 --> 00:42:31.270]  Thank you very much for your interest.
[00:42:32.096 --> 00:42:32.637]  Take care, sir.
[00:42:32.677 --> 00:42:33.638]  We're very, very interested.
[00:42:33.658 --> 00:42:34.079]  Thank you.
[00:42:34.139 --> 00:42:36.442]  There goes Dr. Wodar.
[00:42:37.002 --> 00:42:45.013]  Now, notice that they tried to make it mandatory in France, and then in states in the U.S., and this whole thing fell apart.
[00:42:46.451 --> 00:42:47.871]  Because we exposed it.
[00:42:48.552 --> 00:42:54.694]  Because we found out in January, early on, that they were planning a flu hoax hype.
[00:42:54.794 --> 00:42:56.074]  We didn't know if it would be real.
[00:42:56.414 --> 00:42:57.975]  We didn't know if it would be super deadly.
[00:42:58.355 --> 00:43:00.056]  We didn't know if there would be martial law.
[00:43:00.396 --> 00:43:06.978]  We just knew they were hardening all police facilities for martial law in the name of pandemic mega-death flu.
[00:43:08.368 --> 00:43:09.609]  Millions dead in Illinois.
[00:43:09.689 --> 00:43:11.270]  Millions dead in New York State.
[00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:13.132]  I mean, these are the documents we got.
[00:43:13.232 --> 00:43:14.312]  These are the eyewitnesses.
[00:43:14.733 --> 00:43:18.756]  And I went on air in January, in February, in March, and said, look for flu.
[00:43:19.256 --> 00:43:26.281]  And then when it popped up in Mexico, and they hyped it up, we said, we don't know what's happening, but we know they're staging it.
[00:43:26.641 --> 00:43:27.142]  Look out!
[00:43:27.742 --> 00:43:37.869]  And we, our websites got hacked, we got attacked, and then I really got concerned, because these were government-level attacks, and I was like, my God, this is real.
[00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:45.295]  But the good news is, we exposed the hoax together, you the listeners of this show, and others, and we came through this together.
[00:43:46.881 --> 00:43:55.246]  And now they are damaged to where it will be hard for them, but Obama signed an executive order for total police state control during a biological attack.
[00:43:55.867 --> 00:43:58.808]  Well, he signed that a month ago, or I guess it was in December, a month and a half ago now.
[00:43:59.469 --> 00:44:02.150]  And so there are, it's hard to believe we're in the second month of 2010.
[00:44:02.751 --> 00:44:11.016]  Before we know it, it'll be December 31st, 2010, and we'll be going into 2011 and all of this craziness.
[00:44:11.076 --> 00:44:16.259]  But we've got Freeway Ricky Ross coming up.
[00:44:17.708 --> 00:44:18.449]  Yeah.
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:36.883]  He's interviewed in Kevin's film, How Weed Won the West, and that's Kevin's title.
[00:44:36.903 --> 00:44:37.864]  I think it's a great film.
[00:44:37.924 --> 00:44:38.524]  I consulted on it.
[00:44:38.544 --> 00:44:39.465]  I would have called it Drug War 2.
[00:44:39.985 --> 00:44:45.450]  This exposes the drug war, how they want Codex Alimentarius to restrict and control the vitamins.
[00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:48.572]  It exposes how they're trying to stop medical marijuana.
[00:44:48.612 --> 00:44:53.676]  It exposes how 87% of illegal drug users only use marijuana.
[00:44:53.976 --> 00:45:01.122]  And that's why they want to keep marijuana illegal, because if they don't have that, they don't have an excuse for SWAT teams and prisons and controlling us.
[00:45:01.482 --> 00:45:03.923]  And how the government ships in and launders the majority of the drugs.
[00:45:04.243 --> 00:45:05.143]  How Weed Won the West.
[00:45:05.163 --> 00:45:05.943]  You can pre-order it.
[00:45:06.424 --> 00:45:07.844]  It ships in 12 days.
[00:45:08.004 --> 00:45:08.764]  We have it first.
[00:45:08.884 --> 00:45:10.885]  InfoWars.com.
[00:45:11.045 --> 00:45:13.626]  Also, obviously, Fall of the Republic.

[00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:29.211]  In the last few months, we've been adding new t-shirts every week.
[00:45:30.558 --> 00:45:32.419]  These t-shirts spread the word about freedom.
[00:45:32.719 --> 00:45:41.482]  You meet like-minded people when you go to church, or go to work, or go for a walk, or go to the park, or go to a concert, or go to the bar to, you know, have a beer.
[00:45:43.222 --> 00:45:45.043]  The new t-shirts are in on the back.
[00:45:46.783 --> 00:45:48.184]  It says join the resistance.
[00:45:48.264 --> 00:45:49.664]  Infowars.com.
[00:45:49.684 --> 00:45:51.765]  A walking billboard for liberty.
[00:45:53.706 --> 00:46:00.730]  And on the front it says, Defend Freedom, Join the Resistance, Infowars.com.
[00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:04.332]  And it's got a Minuteman on the front with a bullhorn.
[00:46:04.833 --> 00:46:08.255]  Great design that Janae Meadows, one of our graphics people, came up with.
[00:46:08.715 --> 00:46:10.296]  And here's one that I pretty much designed.
[00:46:11.117 --> 00:46:16.460]  I mean, I said, I want one that looks like a swim team or basketball or football practice jersey.
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.221]  You know, when you're not wearing pads.
[00:46:18.961 --> 00:46:23.084]  I remember these great t-shirts I'd wear in junior high and high school.
[00:46:24.904 --> 00:46:27.006]  It's got a minute man on a horse with a bullhorn.
[00:46:27.586 --> 00:46:31.289]  Defend Freedom, Infowars.com.
[00:46:31.909 --> 00:46:33.510]  And it's got an AK-47 under it.
[00:46:34.331 --> 00:46:39.415]  So, again, ladies and gentlemen, that's what we're talking about here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:39.775 --> 00:46:40.496]  Infowars.com.
[00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:47.013]  For the ball caps, the t-shirts, the sweatshirts, the films, the free deals.

[00:46:49.836 --> 00:46:50.036]  888-253-3139.
[00:46:50.056 --> 00:46:52.918]  Now we ordered a few thousand of the Obama Joker shirts.
[00:47:02.659 --> 00:47:08.722]  And we got eight different designs with Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or Socialist or Fascist.
[00:47:08.742 --> 00:47:10.883]  It's all the same thing, exposing him.
[00:47:10.943 --> 00:47:11.663]  New World Order.
[00:47:12.263 --> 00:47:14.364]  A lot of the sizes and designs have sold out.
[00:47:14.404 --> 00:47:23.569]  There's still a lot of free sizes and designs that are there, but if your size or design isn't there, we have other t-shirts whatever size you want of other designs free when you get Fall of the Republic.
[00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.949]  So again,

[00:47:32.351 --> 00:47:33.191]  So it's a win-win-win.
[00:47:33.211 --> 00:47:36.272]  You get the word out and you support us and you get a great looking t-shirt.
[00:47:36.292 --> 00:47:37.512]  There's like a hundred different t-shirts.
[00:47:37.552 --> 00:47:39.973]  It's got to be, I haven't counted them, up there now that we've designed.
[00:47:40.213 --> 00:47:44.934]  We're just adding more and more and more and more and more to InfoWars.com.
[00:47:45.614 --> 00:47:45.994]  Okay.
[00:47:47.134 --> 00:47:49.295]  And we talk to listeners who wear these out in public.
[00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:51.331]  They're meeting a lot of friends.
[00:47:52.712 --> 00:47:56.855]  Just try putting an InfoWars sticker that we mail out free and a citizen rule book with all the orders.
[00:47:56.895 --> 00:47:57.596]  I forgot about that.
[00:47:57.856 --> 00:47:59.277]  Put that on your car and see what happens.
[00:47:59.657 --> 00:48:03.621]  Now you may run into Johnny Law who may let you out of a ticket because of it.
[00:48:03.641 --> 00:48:04.381]  We've seen that happen.
[00:48:04.501 --> 00:48:05.422]  Or they may freak out.
[00:48:06.143 --> 00:48:11.487]  How dare you in America do that?
[00:48:11.647 --> 00:48:14.249]  Now, how dare you have free speech?
[00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:17.592]  This is the big top story though.
[00:48:18.587 --> 00:48:41.398]  With their swine fluke, hoax collapsing, with their global carbon tax hoax collapsing, with their government takeover of healthcare collapsing, with their staged terror attacks collapsing, with their whole agenda, globally, no one believes anything they say, all the corruption's coming out, the banker bailout, totally being exposed, the people are finding out about Obama, lying about everything that he's a puppet,
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:47.642]  They want to stage terror attacks, and I'm telling you, that's the only card they've got to play.
[00:48:47.722 --> 00:48:48.723]  That or a new war.
[00:48:48.843 --> 00:48:56.206]  And to get the war with Iran, they're going to need to have a staged terror attack.
[00:48:56.246 --> 00:48:59.987]  I know Paul Watson told me before I went on air, he's writing a big detailed report on this.
[00:49:00.007 --> 00:49:06.530]  I hope he adds the part about all the White House officials and the five different network
[00:49:09.955 --> 00:49:16.204]  Advisors on military affairs, all former generals, that famous tape came out three years ago, where they're saying, man, we really need another terror attack.
[00:49:16.524 --> 00:49:17.926]  Another 9-11 would sure help us.
[00:49:18.748 --> 00:49:20.971]  And Rumsfeld, yeah, it's too bad, just the public, you know.
[00:49:21.191 --> 00:49:25.217]  I mean, they come one hair breadth from coming right out and saying they carried out 9-11.
[00:49:26.448 --> 00:49:27.068]  Yes, it's up.
[00:49:27.228 --> 00:49:27.828]  Red alert!
[00:49:28.008 --> 00:49:32.670]  Intelligence chiefs certain their bosses will stage terror attacks soon.
[00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:35.710]  And we know the underwear bomber was staged.
[00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:37.171]  They let him on the plane, protected him.
[00:49:38.011 --> 00:49:38.251]  U.S.
[00:49:38.291 --> 00:49:40.371]  government, State Department said we were tracking him.
[00:49:40.671 --> 00:49:41.552]  Totally staged.
[00:49:43.232 --> 00:49:45.673]  And this article is now up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:49:45.733 --> 00:49:48.453]  You guys print it for me so I can read it instead of looking across the room when I get back.
[00:49:48.493 --> 00:49:48.693]  Thanks.
[00:49:48.713 --> 00:49:54.775]  We're going to cover this when we come back from break and dovetail it with Neocon says Obama
[00:49:55.717 --> 00:49:57.959]  Should save presidency by attacking Iran.
[00:49:57.979 --> 00:50:00.020]  This was just said yesterday in National Review.
[00:50:02.422 --> 00:50:04.564]  And if that isn't a staged terror attack, I don't know what is.
[00:50:04.584 --> 00:50:13.010]  And then we have all these other people in the past, these different neocons, coming out and saying we sure need another 9-11.
[00:50:14.151 --> 00:50:18.634]  So I want to go over some of their statements as well.
[00:50:19.635 --> 00:50:21.216]  Because these people are just
[00:50:22.779 --> 00:50:27.821]  devilishly obvious and have such contempt for the public, they just admit this right out in the open.
[00:50:30.061 --> 00:50:36.823]  And so again, this is Stu Bykovsky, writing for the Philadelphia Daily News.
[00:50:36.843 --> 00:50:41.345]  I want to remind you of what he said, where they're just right out in the open with their game plan.
[00:50:41.445 --> 00:50:44.405]  If they don't stage terror and launch new wars, it's over for them.
[00:50:44.605 --> 00:50:48.387]  But if we expose them ahead of them doing it, that'll blow up in their face too.
[00:50:48.727 --> 00:50:49.187]  Stay with us.
[00:50:52.665 --> 00:50:57.147]  Have your house payments skyrocketed under an adjustable rate mortgage?

[00:51:00.889 --> 00:51:02.249]  Are balloon payments coming due?

[00:52:54.153 --> 00:52:55.394]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:52:55.454 --> 00:53:00.799]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:53:01.039 --> 00:53:05.663]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:53:06.064 --> 00:53:11.128]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:53:11.629 --> 00:53:16.313]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:23.763]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:53:23.963 --> 00:53:24.863]  And here's the best part.
[00:53:25.083 --> 00:53:31.446]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[00:53:43.550 --> 00:53:43.891]  327-0365.
[00:53:44.711 --> 00:53:50.515]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:53:50.815 --> 00:53:53.277]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:54:04.084 --> 00:54:05.284]  Here's the top story.
[00:54:05.344 --> 00:54:07.886]  This is your daily action, folks.
[00:54:07.946 --> 00:54:11.869]  I need you to post this on all your Facebooks, your MySpace, your Twitter.
[00:54:13.507 --> 00:54:21.796]  We were looking at Facebook and there's 20 or so fan sites with over 100,000 members.
[00:54:23.157 --> 00:54:24.619]  Just get it out to everybody.
[00:54:25.199 --> 00:54:25.860]  Red Alert!
[00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:30.165]  Intelligence Chiefs Certain Their Bosses Will Stage Terror Attack.
[00:54:30.565 --> 00:54:33.568]  This is from PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:54:33.808 --> 00:54:34.910]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:54:36.024 --> 00:54:42.730]  Dissatisfied with their botched efforts of the underwear bombing Patsy, Military Industrial Complex promises to try again.
[00:54:43.811 --> 00:54:52.119]  Using information gleaned from the blatantly set-up underwear bomber Patsy, intelligence chiefs have assured us that their bosses will stage another terror attack in the U.S.
[00:54:52.139 --> 00:54:54.542]  I'm going to play the Fox News clip in the last 30 minutes of the show today.
[00:54:55.062 --> 00:54:56.724]  Within the next three to six months.
[00:54:57.965 --> 00:55:00.888]  And that's their timeline as they mass ships and troops for Iran.
[00:55:02.136 --> 00:55:09.521]  According to the nation's intelligence chiefs, a terror attack in the United States will be likely launched within the next six months, reports the Wall Street Journal.
[00:55:10.842 --> 00:55:16.566]  ABC News has learned some of the intelligence has come from accused Christmas Day bomber, states the report.
[00:55:16.906 --> 00:55:22.730]  Now they want to x-ray your body with chest x-rays because they may have fake breast implants with bombs.
[00:55:23.331 --> 00:55:30.336]  Despite the fact that the official story behind the Christmas Day bombing has been discredited beyond all recognition, the establishment is still constantly invoking
[00:55:31.385 --> 00:55:39.215]  It is yet another reason for Americans to obediently line up for naked body scans in fear of what other boogeyman is being waved in front of their faces this week.
[00:55:40.188 --> 00:56:00.375]  Since federal and state authorities apparently now consider libertarians, Ron Paul supporters, gun owners, and basically anyone with two brain cells left rubbed together as potential terrorists, domestic terrorists, whatever tricks they do decide to pull over the next six months will undoubtedly be used to tighten the screws against the American dissidents they have consistently characterized as extremist threats.
[00:56:00.875 --> 00:56:04.416]  And they're saying they want to start censoring the internet in the name of countering this.
[00:56:04.476 --> 00:56:06.397]  I mean, they're moving, folks, because we're hurting them.
[00:56:07.117 --> 00:56:26.916]  Authorities, not servants, but authorities, last week quietly reversed the official story behind the Christmas Day underwear bombing attack, acknowledging that the accomplice was involved despite weeks of denial and derision of key eyewitness Kurt Haskell's description of a sharp-dressed man who helped the underwear bomber board flight 253 in Amsterdam to Detroit.
[00:56:27.987 --> 00:56:38.376]  Detroit lawyer Kurt Haskell maintained from the beginning that he saw a well-dressed Indian man aid the accused bomber to board the plane despite the fact that he had no passport and was on a terror watch list.
[00:56:38.917 --> 00:56:43.321]  While Muttalib was poorly dressed, his friend was dressed in exquisite suit, Haskell said.
[00:56:45.066 --> 00:56:49.230]  The suited man asked ticket agents whether the underwear bomber could board without a passport.
[00:56:49.290 --> 00:56:51.471]  This guy, he said, is from Sudan.
[00:56:51.792 --> 00:56:54.374]  We do this all the time, reported Michigan Live News website.
[00:56:55.154 --> 00:57:02.381]  FBI agents interviewed Haskell and told him about the sharp-dressed man, but officials refused to admit that a wider conspiracy was
[00:57:03.141 --> 00:57:07.990]  At hand, stoically maintaining the official story that the underwear bomber acted alone.
[00:57:08.370 --> 00:57:15.343]  Authorities claim that videotapes did not show a second man accompanying the underwear bomber, and yet they refuse to release any footage of the alleged bomber.
[00:57:16.701 --> 00:57:20.823]  There seems little doubt that the underwear bomber was at least one accomplice, if not more.
[00:57:20.863 --> 00:57:30.188]  Authorities have remained silent about other eyewitness reports which described a man intently filming the alleged terrorist throughout the whole flight.
[00:57:30.708 --> 00:57:38.732]  A connection that strongly suggests the attempted bomber was involved in some kind of drill and that his strings were being pulled by people in more senior positions.
[00:57:39.872 --> 00:57:42.834]  Then you have the other guy they say they found with a bomb that they jerked off the plane.
[00:57:44.705 --> 00:57:45.325]  It continues.
[00:57:45.365 --> 00:57:57.391]  Hundreds of terror suspects, patsies and mentally deficient, have been convicted in civilian federal courts, including convicted shoe bomber Richard Reed, who attended the Finsbury Park Mosque of North London.
[00:57:57.411 --> 00:58:03.733]  The Finsbury Imam, at the time, has been working for British security services since 97.
[00:58:05.287 --> 00:58:09.309]  Just like the head of the 7-7 bombings was one of their security service people.
[00:58:09.789 --> 00:58:17.734]  A large number of the supposed terrorists convicted in American courts were entrapped by FBI and classic COINTELPRO fashion did not have links to CIA-created al-Qaeda.
[00:58:18.134 --> 00:58:23.117]  The entrapped often fuzzy on al-Qaeda or what it represents.
[00:58:23.197 --> 00:58:30.861]  And then they get into the key areas here where the neocons are calling for some type of staged event or new war.
[00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:32.282]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:58:35.447 --> 00:58:37.273]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:38.698 --> 00:58:40.906]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:44.144 --> 00:58:46.746]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:47.166 --> 00:58:52.129]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:58:52.489 --> 00:58:54.210]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:59.353]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:58:59.533 --> 00:59:00.493]  How much do you want?
[00:59:00.714 --> 00:59:01.454]  When do you want it?
[00:59:01.834 --> 00:59:03.435]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:03.735 --> 00:59:04.556]  When will you need it?
[00:59:04.796 --> 00:59:06.857]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:06.997 --> 00:59:08.118]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:08.338 --> 00:59:09.659]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:10.319 --> 00:59:12.242]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:59:12.402 --> 00:59:14.926]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:15.126 --> 00:59:18.310]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:18.711 --> 00:59:22.216]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:22.536 --> 00:59:23.538]  How much will you need?
[00:59:23.758 --> 00:59:24.399]  We don't know.
[00:59:24.659 --> 00:59:25.580]  How much do you want?
[00:59:25.781 --> 00:59:26.502]  All you can get.
[00:59:26.522 --> 00:59:27.363]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:27.763 --> 00:59:30.544]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:30.824 --> 00:59:33.005]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:33.025 --> 00:59:34.026]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:34.046 --> 00:59:35.206]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:35.246 --> 00:59:37.067]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:58.266 --> 01:00:02.429]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:03.089 --> 01:00:03.909]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:05.590]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:06.231 --> 01:00:09.853]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.413 --> 01:00:14.496]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.837 --> 01:00:24.482]  The neokinds at National Review and other places are calling for an attack on Iran to get Obama's approval ratings up.
[01:00:24.642 --> 01:00:25.863]  That's coming up the next hour.
[01:00:28.936 --> 01:00:35.545]  But for the next 60 minutes, we're joined by Free Ray Ricky Ross, one of the biggest cocaine dealers in U.S.
[01:00:35.565 --> 01:00:36.006]  history.
[01:00:36.026 --> 01:00:43.377]  And he was sentenced to life imprisonment after being convicted of trying to purchase more than 100 kilograms of cocaine from a federal agent.
[01:00:44.301 --> 01:00:51.583]  Ross's capture was facilitated by his career-long dealer, and it goes through all of that.
[01:00:51.883 --> 01:01:00.085]  It came out in the Dark Alliance piece done by Gary Webb that won the Pulitzer Prize, that the CIA was the main supplier of Ross.
[01:01:00.545 --> 01:01:05.347]  In 96, the CIA's inspector general basically admitted all this before Congress.
[01:01:06.207 --> 01:01:10.809]  And we have all the cases of CIA aircraft crashing with pure cocaine on board coming from the source.
[01:01:11.169 --> 01:01:13.089]  That happened just a year or so ago in Mexico.
[01:01:13.530 --> 01:01:14.570]  This goes on and on.
[01:01:14.610 --> 01:01:22.212]  So I want to get somebody at the heart of the cocaine epidemic on to break down what the drug war is really all about.
[01:01:22.232 --> 01:01:23.393]  He finally got out of prison.
[01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:28.835]  There have been all these big TV shows and movies and things made about Free Ray Ricky Ross.
[01:01:29.975 --> 01:01:31.776]  And he now joins us here today.
[01:01:31.796 --> 01:01:32.456]  Good to have you with us.
[01:01:33.254 --> 01:01:34.614]  Yeah, I'm glad to be here, man.
[01:01:34.854 --> 01:01:37.175]  Thanks for having me.
[01:01:37.195 --> 01:01:43.176]  When I was in prison, I remember all the trouble that you went through trying to get in there and then, you know, people weren't going to have it.
[01:01:45.436 --> 01:01:46.337]  But now you're out.
[01:01:46.397 --> 01:01:51.658]  I mean, look, your bio is so amazingly complex.
[01:01:52.278 --> 01:01:55.659]  Just out of the gates, describe yourself the way you would describe Ricky Ross.
[01:01:56.419 --> 01:01:58.419]  Man, I'm a loving, caring person.
[01:01:59.159 --> 01:02:00.179]  I love to help people.
[01:02:00.199 --> 01:02:02.820]  I want to see people happy, free.
[01:02:03.382 --> 01:02:04.083]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:02:22.794 --> 01:02:23.755]  And logical thinkers.
[01:02:24.255 --> 01:02:27.879]  You know, right now we're raising a bunch of robots where they just go along with the system.
[01:02:28.219 --> 01:02:32.663]  You know, whatever the powers that be say, they do it and never ask any questions.
[01:02:32.743 --> 01:02:35.086]  And you know, you got to question what's going on here.
[01:02:35.486 --> 01:02:46.816]  You know, when you see these people attacking different countries over oil and, you know, resources, you know, it makes you wonder, you know, what is all this about?
[01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:48.378]  You know, is it really about
[01:02:49.201 --> 01:02:57.105]  Weapons of mass destruction are really just about making somebody's pocket richer who already have so much money that they're never going to spend it.
[01:02:58.546 --> 01:02:59.226]  Absolutely.
[01:02:59.307 --> 01:03:02.348]  Expanding on that, Ricky.
[01:03:03.009 --> 01:03:03.869]  Expanding on it.
[01:03:05.530 --> 01:03:07.911]  Just in a nutshell, how did you get into drug dealing?
[01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:09.852]  How did you get supplied by the CIA?
[01:03:10.252 --> 01:03:14.415]  And is it true you were making profit four or five million dollars a day?
[01:03:16.276 --> 01:03:19.097]  Yes, I got into it from a school teacher.
[01:03:19.618 --> 01:03:21.979]  Turn me on to the drug business.
[01:03:23.679 --> 01:03:26.641]  I started with absolutely nothing, $125.
[01:03:26.721 --> 01:03:27.301]  I was broke.
[01:03:28.902 --> 01:03:34.164]  I was making my hay day a million to two million dollars every day.
[01:03:35.044 --> 01:03:39.146]  It wouldn't be a day, not a day went by that I wasn't making a million dollars.
[01:03:41.047 --> 01:03:43.608]  Now was that profit or just overall?
[01:03:44.261 --> 01:03:45.303]  Overall, what's in profit?
[01:03:45.323 --> 01:03:48.870]  That would be, uh, off of a million dollars, my profit would be about $200,000.
[01:03:52.734 --> 01:04:08.267]  Now, when we come back, because we're about to break, I want to go through the history briefly for people that don't know, most people do, but directly from the horse's mouth, as they say, not from the media spin, that you didn't even discover until later you were really being supplied by the CIA.
[01:04:08.627 --> 01:04:11.149]  I want to walk through that, because this is a historical record.
[01:04:11.169 --> 01:04:13.751]  And then Gary Webb, they tried to discredit him.
[01:04:13.771 --> 01:04:15.893]  He had a new book coming out proving he was right.
[01:04:15.913 --> 01:04:17.034]  He's been since vindicated.
[01:04:17.054 --> 01:04:19.736]  He said people had been breaking into his house.
[01:04:19.796 --> 01:04:20.737]  Then he got killed.
[01:04:21.437 --> 01:04:21.837]  I don't know.
[01:04:31.581 --> 01:04:32.642]  Ricky Ross, stay there.

[01:04:51.971 --> 01:04:52.391]  Stay with us.
[01:04:53.663 --> 01:04:57.666]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[01:04:57.766 --> 01:05:00.509]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:05:00.649 --> 01:05:01.890]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:02.590]  It's very real.
[01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:04.852]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:05:04.972 --> 01:05:06.493]  And it's available right now to you.

[01:05:53.424 --> 01:05:57.667]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:57.987 --> 01:05:58.587]  Number one.
[01:05:58.888 --> 01:06:02.050]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:02.330 --> 01:06:02.870]  Number two.
[01:06:03.171 --> 01:06:07.734]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:08.074 --> 01:06:08.514]  It's true.
[01:06:08.814 --> 01:06:13.377]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:14.258]  Number three.
[01:06:14.518 --> 01:06:17.800]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:21.803]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:22.003 --> 01:06:22.544]  Number 4.
[01:06:22.804 --> 01:06:25.166]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:25.566 --> 01:06:28.929]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:29.229 --> 01:06:29.450]  Number 5.
[01:06:30.030 --> 01:06:33.953]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:34.174 --> 01:06:38.938]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:07:58.883 --> 01:07:59.504]  Big Brother.
[01:08:00.184 --> 01:08:01.245]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:01.966 --> 01:08:03.067]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:03.707 --> 01:08:04.528]  You want answers?
[01:08:05.288 --> 01:08:06.209]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:10.493]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:11.053 --> 01:08:15.157]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:17.178 --> 01:08:21.021]  FreewayEnterprise.com.

[01:08:26.666 --> 01:08:27.367]  Ricky Ross.
[01:08:28.624 --> 01:08:30.804]  Spent decades in prison.
[01:08:31.225 --> 01:08:32.925]  We interviewed him from prison over the phone.
[01:08:32.985 --> 01:08:35.125]  Couldn't ever get into interviewing him.
[01:08:35.145 --> 01:08:38.446]  For American Drug War, five years in the making that Kevin Booth made.
[01:08:38.466 --> 01:08:43.547]  By the way, that's available at InfoWars.com with how we won the West exposing this.
[01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:46.848]  Our listeners on the Twitter, on the Facebook are going crazy.
[01:08:46.868 --> 01:08:55.909]  If you have questions for Freeway Ricky Ross, you can send it to Twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones and we'll ask some of those questions.
[01:08:55.929 --> 01:08:57.610]  But Mr. Ross, again,
[01:08:58.870 --> 01:09:00.031]  Well, I'm going to have him tell it.
[01:09:00.951 --> 01:09:23.561]  Going through how he became the biggest drug dealer on the West Coast, how he discovered that it was the CIA supplying him, it came out in the Dark Majesty and Dark Alliance pieces done by Gary Webb, they clearly then murdered him, the cover-up of that, and now where he's going today, what he's doing today, and what he has to say about the phony drug war.
[01:09:23.981 --> 01:09:25.662]  We've got all these drug dealers interviewed.
[01:09:25.942 --> 01:09:28.043]  I've got a lot to say about that, Alex.
[01:09:29.158 --> 01:09:29.858]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:09:30.218 --> 01:09:30.838]  It's robbery.
[01:09:30.858 --> 01:09:32.499]  A lot of those people should be put in prison.
[01:09:34.479 --> 01:09:35.960]  That's running this drug war.
[01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:36.940]  It's a mockery.
[01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:39.861]  Well, we're going to get into that.
[01:09:39.881 --> 01:09:44.962]  In fact, right now, just give us your take on how the drug war really works, who's really behind the drugs, and let's go over your history.
[01:09:45.742 --> 01:09:49.523]  Well, you know, Alex, I started off when I first started selling drugs, Alex.
[01:09:49.943 --> 01:09:53.304]  Believe it or not, I had no clue that I was going to become a drug dealer.
[01:09:54.162 --> 01:09:55.823]  No intentions on becoming a drug dealer.
[01:09:55.843 --> 01:10:05.689]  I was a tennis player trying to become a tennis pro, wanting to go to college first to play tennis, and then wanting to go from there to become a pro.
[01:10:06.409 --> 01:10:14.534]  It was a movie came out that first introduced me, the first time I ever heard about cocaine, and then it went from there to a teacher telling me that that's how he made his money.
[01:10:15.434 --> 01:10:16.715]  And that sparked my interest.
[01:10:16.795 --> 01:10:23.199]  I went from being a total novice within five months to being, you know, a player.
[01:10:23.692 --> 01:10:28.055]  In the drug business, making, you know, $1,000 a day.
[01:10:28.616 --> 01:10:33.019]  So, basically, I was trapped, almost, I would say.
[01:10:33.359 --> 01:10:46.449]  Because, you know, when I go out and talk to these kids right now, I let them know that I know that today they may be innocent and not involved in drugs or anything like that there, but tomorrow, you know, that could change with circumstances.
[01:10:47.690 --> 01:10:49.711]  So that's basically how I got started in it.
[01:10:51.388 --> 01:10:55.992]  How I found out about that the CIA was involved, I got a call one day from my lawyer.
[01:10:57.594 --> 01:11:00.416]  My counselor came and got me and said, hey, your lawyer said he needs to talk to you.
[01:11:00.837 --> 01:11:05.220]  So when I called my lawyer back, it was, uh, he was telling me about Gary.
[01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:08.784]  He didn't tell me Gary's name, but he said some reporter's investigating you, informant.
[01:11:09.184 --> 01:11:10.765]  And he said that this guy's a major player.
[01:11:10.805 --> 01:11:12.607]  I said, well, I already knew he was a major player.
[01:11:13.388 --> 01:11:14.929]  That's where I used to get all my drugs from.
[01:11:15.349 --> 01:11:15.750]  So, uh,
[01:11:16.613 --> 01:11:18.135]  I don't know how major he was though.
[01:11:18.195 --> 01:11:20.697]  I didn't know that he had the ties that he had.
[01:11:20.737 --> 01:11:23.800]  I thought that we were just basically working Los Angeles.
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:29.385]  I didn't know that he had spots up in San Francisco, Oklahoma, New Orleans.
[01:11:29.825 --> 01:11:31.227]  He was basically working the whole country.
[01:11:33.689 --> 01:11:36.590]  My lawyer told me, he said, well, uh, this reporter wants to come and see you.
[01:11:36.691 --> 01:11:38.031]  I said, well, I ain't got nothing to lose.
[01:11:38.071 --> 01:11:39.232]  You know, I'm looking at a life sentence.
[01:11:39.292 --> 01:11:40.272]  I ain't never going home.
[01:11:40.733 --> 01:11:42.954]  And the evidence is, is stacked up pretty good against me.
[01:11:42.974 --> 01:11:48.476]  You know, this guy, he called me and tells me that he had 700 kilos of cocaine and he needs to get rid of them.
[01:11:48.536 --> 01:11:52.518]  And these guys are on his back and he owes them money and they're going to do something to him.
[01:11:52.598 --> 01:11:59.262]  And would I please help him get rid of, you know, a couple hundred, you know, and I try to explain to him, Hey man, you know, I'm out the game.
[01:11:59.322 --> 01:12:01.783]  I'm trying to go straight through the right thing, you know, and, uh,
[01:12:02.475 --> 01:12:03.956]  You know just do the right thing now.
[01:12:13.118 --> 01:12:13.518]  D.A.
[01:12:13.558 --> 01:12:18.341]  come in and arrest all of us and take my friend's money who I introduced him to.
[01:12:18.401 --> 01:12:24.084]  They wanted to burn you in hindsight because previously your big supplier had been the CIA.
[01:12:24.124 --> 01:12:30.068]  Let's go back though and explain that because that later came out in the Dark Alliance piece.
[01:12:30.148 --> 01:12:30.688]  Absolutely.
[01:12:30.908 --> 01:12:32.629]  Give folks the names of these players.
[01:12:35.771 --> 01:12:37.712]  Norman Nestor, Danilo Blandon.
[01:12:37.732 --> 01:12:40.374]  Danilo Blandon is the guy that I dealt with ten hands.
[01:12:40.896 --> 01:12:43.619]  You know, I saw him every single day, two or three times a day.
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:52.168]  Norman Nessus, I never remember seeing him, but Danilo testified on the witness stand that we had been in buildings a couple times together.
[01:12:52.188 --> 01:12:54.430]  Because, you know, when I was young, I was young.
[01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:57.413]  I wasn't really paying attention to who was who, whose name was what.
[01:12:58.154 --> 01:12:59.275]  I didn't care about the country.
[01:12:59.615 --> 01:13:01.437]  They were using you as the main front.
[01:13:01.497 --> 01:13:01.958]  Continue.
[01:13:02.597 --> 01:13:02.897]  Right.
[01:13:03.278 --> 01:13:06.241]  Basically, the only thing I was really doing, Alex, was selling drugs.
[01:13:06.842 --> 01:13:12.548]  I loved it that I was getting drugs so cheap and I could beat anybody's price and I could get all the drugs that I wanted.
[01:13:13.089 --> 01:13:14.851]  Those were my main concerns at that time.
[01:13:14.911 --> 01:13:17.353]  I didn't care if they was coming from the Contras, the CIA.
[01:13:17.413 --> 01:13:18.575]  I didn't ask any questions.
[01:13:19.536 --> 01:13:21.518]  You know, you're taking a guy who was fat broke and
[01:13:22.338 --> 01:13:25.541]  You know, living in South Central Los Angeles, and now he's out of South Central.
[01:13:25.561 --> 01:13:29.544]  He has a condo and houses and cars, and I'm able to help my family.
[01:13:29.564 --> 01:13:36.250]  Those are the things that I was... Yeah, suddenly you're making a million dollars a day, but the government, the banks, bringing it in and laundering it.
[01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:37.171]  They're not bad.
[01:13:37.431 --> 01:13:38.191]  It's you that's bad.
[01:13:38.232 --> 01:13:44.417]  So, so, Simeon, bring us through, when you really got the big connections, what year that was when the money really started rolling in?
[01:13:44.957 --> 01:13:45.578]  About 82ish, 83ish.
[01:13:47.987 --> 01:13:53.469]  We started making money hand over... I mean, just... I started making so much money that money didn't even matter anymore.
[01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:54.710]  It wasn't about the money.
[01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:57.471]  It got to the point where I was just doing it for the rush.
[01:13:57.911 --> 01:13:59.952]  I had more money than I thought I could ever spend.
[01:14:01.293 --> 01:14:02.573]  You know, I just bought whatever I wanted.
[01:14:03.834 --> 01:14:10.737]  And how I found out about the CIA for the first time was when Gary Webb's paper was... Gary didn't let it out.
[01:14:11.257 --> 01:14:13.778]  You know, Gary didn't tell me what the story was.
[01:14:14.458 --> 01:14:15.599]  First, he wanted to make sure that
[01:14:16.235 --> 01:14:17.515]  We walk to the same guy.
[01:14:17.555 --> 01:14:19.676]  My guy who set me up was his guy.
[01:14:20.476 --> 01:14:27.657]  And, uh, the next thing I know, uh, after my trial, you know, Gary, Gary basically questioned Blandon for us.
[01:14:27.897 --> 01:14:30.297]  He interrogated Blandon through my attorney.
[01:14:31.718 --> 01:14:35.218]  And this is the San Jose Mercury News Pulitzer Prize winning author?
[01:14:35.858 --> 01:14:36.098]  Right.
[01:14:36.698 --> 01:14:45.500]  And, uh, what we did when we were going to trial, Gary sat right on the first row, and whenever my lawyer would lead a question, he would always walk back to Gary and ask me, what should I ask him?
[01:14:46.187 --> 01:14:54.169]  And then Gary would give him names and, you know, times and dates and all this stuff, and we couldn't believe where all this information was coming from.
[01:14:54.949 --> 01:15:04.311]  So, uh, Gary made the informant say stuff like, uh, Reagan and gave him $18 million to buy medical supplies, and they took it and bought drugs.
[01:15:04.792 --> 01:15:07.912]  You know, things of that nature came out in his testimony.
[01:15:09.853 --> 01:15:13.794]  So it turns out that Blandon and others were working for the CIA.
[01:15:15.026 --> 01:15:15.466]  Absolutely.
[01:15:15.526 --> 01:15:17.307]  They're what they call CIA operatives.
[01:15:17.727 --> 01:15:22.869]  They're not CIA agents, but they were operatives.
[01:15:23.669 --> 01:15:33.012]  Meaning that they're on the CIA payroll, but you know they don't have green cards, so that they can't officially be CIA agents.
[01:15:34.473 --> 01:15:38.854]  And then later, people like Barry Seal, who were operatives, they end up killing them.
[01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:39.634]  Absolutely.
[01:15:39.734 --> 01:15:41.555]  We're not sure if Landon's still alive.
[01:15:43.919 --> 01:15:45.123]  We don't know where he's at right now.
[01:15:45.666 --> 01:15:48.828]  Go through some more of what came out in the trial and what came out in Dark Alliance.
[01:15:48.849 --> 01:16:13.748]  I mean, they really wanted to get Webb, and I talked to his friends and others who said that there were people breaking in his house, everything else, and then suddenly all these operatives came out and said, we were liars, nobody ever broke in his house, even though I had all these friends that had talked to Gary Webb, I'd interviewed Gary Webb, I'd talked to Webb about threats he was getting, he's got a new book coming out, totally proving even more, I was going to get him on, and then he shoots himself twice in the head with a shotgun.
[01:16:15.742 --> 01:16:18.323]  Not just there, but even in the courtroom they harassed Gary.
[01:16:18.684 --> 01:16:22.966]  You know, the DA, the prosecutor, all of them told Gary that they were going to get him.
[01:16:23.346 --> 01:16:25.067]  You know, they didn't want him inside the courtroom.
[01:16:25.227 --> 01:16:25.607]  Oh, really?
[01:16:25.667 --> 01:16:27.348]  Tell us about that as a witness in the court.
[01:16:27.968 --> 01:16:33.231]  Oh, well, when he was inside the courtroom, they would... When he walked outside the hall, all of them would be all over him.
[01:16:33.631 --> 01:16:34.932]  What the hell are you doing here?
[01:16:34.972 --> 01:16:35.792]  Get out of here!
[01:16:35.832 --> 01:16:36.713]  You don't know what you're doing.
[01:16:36.733 --> 01:16:38.213]  You don't know what you're talking about.
[01:16:38.614 --> 01:16:39.774]  You're going to get yours.
[01:16:39.914 --> 01:16:41.935]  I mean, just all kind of crazy stuff.
[01:16:41.975 --> 01:16:44.897]  My lawyer would tell me what was going on in the hallway.
[01:16:45.834 --> 01:16:46.955]  You know, because I couldn't see that.
[01:16:47.235 --> 01:16:53.280]  But this is the things that my lawyer was telling me and also Gary had told me some of the things that had happened to him as well.
[01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:54.480]  Well, that's like the D.C.
[01:16:54.521 --> 01:16:54.821]  madam.
[01:16:54.881 --> 01:16:56.182]  I said, you're not going to kill yourself.
[01:16:56.202 --> 01:16:56.962]  And she said, no.
[01:16:57.523 --> 01:16:58.804]  And then I said, you better watch it.
[01:16:58.844 --> 01:17:01.125]  And then her landlord said people were following her.
[01:17:01.446 --> 01:17:02.547]  She was fearing for her life.
[01:17:02.587 --> 01:17:03.667]  She would never kill herself.
[01:17:04.088 --> 01:17:04.848]  Then they kill her.
[01:17:05.209 --> 01:17:09.592]  And then they have these operatives come out on the news and say, she told me she was going to kill herself.
[01:17:09.872 --> 01:17:16.276]  Look, if anybody kills me or kills you, let's say it on record, I'm never going to kill myself and you're never going to kill yourself.
[01:17:16.316 --> 01:17:16.777]  Right, Ricky?
[01:17:16.797 --> 01:17:17.557]  Absolutely.
[01:17:17.597 --> 01:17:18.698]  I was just going to tell you that.
[01:17:18.738 --> 01:17:20.679]  Just for the record, Alex, I love living.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:21.480]  I'm breathing.
[01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:24.642]  I want to take a deep breath right now because I like breathing so much.
[01:17:25.262 --> 01:17:26.563]  I would never kill myself.
[01:17:26.603 --> 01:17:27.104]  I don't care.
[01:17:27.404 --> 01:17:30.126]  I'd rather go back to prison for life than to be dead.
[01:17:30.846 --> 01:17:33.208]  So I'm never going to kill myself.
[01:17:33.228 --> 01:17:36.370]  There's never going to get anything out of here that would make me kill myself.
[01:17:37.133 --> 01:17:40.774]  So just for the record, Ricky Ross will never kill himself.
[01:17:40.814 --> 01:17:44.955]  So if something happened to me, you know that it wasn't suicide.
[01:17:45.655 --> 01:17:48.876]  And if somebody comes out and says you said you were, they're a liar.
[01:17:49.637 --> 01:17:50.137]  Absolutely.
[01:17:50.217 --> 01:17:54.138]  You're getting it right here live on the Alex Jones Show that Ricky Ross
[01:17:54.913 --> 01:17:55.913]  Love being free.
[01:17:56.374 --> 01:17:59.014]  He loves his freedom and I love working with these children.
[01:17:59.034 --> 01:18:04.216]  I'm getting such results that I would never kill myself and I'm planning on living a long time.
[01:18:04.616 --> 01:18:06.097]  Matter of fact, you know, I eat healthy.
[01:18:06.677 --> 01:18:07.357]  I drive safe.
[01:18:07.397 --> 01:18:08.998]  I wear my seatbelt everywhere I go.
[01:18:12.419 --> 01:18:13.359]  I want to be around.
[01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:16.280]  So y'all watch out for me.
[01:18:17.492 --> 01:18:18.693]  And I want to second all that.
[01:18:18.733 --> 01:18:20.474]  In fact, I've even done that myself on air.
[01:18:20.874 --> 01:18:29.778]  I mean, I love breath, I love life, my heart's beating good, and I drive safe, and I wear my seatbelt, and I don't use drugs.
[01:18:34.381 --> 01:18:36.322]  Yeah, our government is off the chain, man.
[01:18:36.882 --> 01:18:39.003]  We, the people, we've got to stand up to the attitude.
[01:18:39.063 --> 01:18:44.486]  It's time we come out of this robotic state, man, and start doing, you know, they've been
[01:18:45.583 --> 01:18:47.624]  Well take Rush Limbaugh.
[01:18:47.944 --> 01:18:51.807]  He was eating a hundred Oxycontins a day until it made him go deaf.
[01:18:51.867 --> 01:18:55.989]  That would, they did a calculation, would kill seven average-sized horses.
[01:18:56.009 --> 01:18:58.650]  He was that addicted, probably has a liver the size of a
[01:19:12.683 --> 01:19:13.823]  You know, of a couch.
[01:19:14.543 --> 01:19:20.284]  And he says if somebody gets caught with cocaine, they need 25 years in prison, first offense.
[01:19:20.525 --> 01:19:23.165]  But if he's taking synthetic heroin, that's okay.
[01:19:23.805 --> 01:19:24.365]  Exactly.
[01:19:24.465 --> 01:19:25.365]  It's a double standard.
[01:19:27.086 --> 01:19:32.127]  If you're not in, you know, one of the good old boys, you know, you go to prison.
[01:19:32.427 --> 01:19:37.008]  If you're a good old boy, you know, you get a TV show, a radio show like Oliver North.
[01:19:37.088 --> 01:19:38.588]  I mean, I didn't say that, did I?
[01:19:41.041 --> 01:19:42.163]  Ricky Ross, stay there.
[01:19:42.183 --> 01:19:44.687]  We're going to come back and continue with the government drug dealing.
[01:19:44.727 --> 01:19:49.454]  What you're doing currently, your website and a lot more, freewayenterprises.com.
[01:19:49.774 --> 01:19:50.515]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:19:54.153 --> 01:19:55.734]  You may be new to freeze-dry foods.
[01:19:55.954 --> 01:19:57.535]  You may have storable food questions.
[01:19:57.775 --> 01:20:02.338]  You may want to buy your freeze-dried foods from a very reputable company and not go broke in the process.
[01:20:02.618 --> 01:20:04.219]  Welcome to the freeze-dry guy.
[01:20:04.399 --> 01:20:06.721]  Okay, actually we're more than just one guy.
[01:20:06.841 --> 01:20:09.643]  We're a California-based company that's been serving our U.S.
[01:20:09.683 --> 01:20:15.406]  military and other government agencies with the finest in freeze-dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.
[01:20:16.667 --> 01:20:19.028]  See all about us at freezedryguy.com.
[01:20:19.188 --> 01:20:25.230]  With Freeze Dry Guy freeze dried foods, you can and will be ready for just about any unexpected crisis.
[01:20:25.471 --> 01:20:32.413]  Freeze Dry Guy foods are delicious, require little preparation, and will taste just as fresh decades from now as they do today.
[01:20:32.553 --> 01:20:33.974]  Just add hot water and serve.
[01:20:34.174 --> 01:20:39.036]  Backpackers consistently rate us number one year after year as the best tasting and ease of preparation.
[01:20:39.096 --> 01:20:42.398]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:20:42.438 --> 01:20:44.499]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:20:44.559 --> 01:20:45.860]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:21:04.412 --> 01:21:07.075]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:21:07.095 --> 01:21:13.321]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:13.481 --> 01:21:18.505]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:21:18.525 --> 01:21:28.655]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:21:28.775 --> 01:21:30.877]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:21:31.117 --> 01:21:32.438]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:32.698 --> 01:21:34.980]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:37.002]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:21:37.282 --> 01:21:42.106]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:21:42.446 --> 01:21:51.534]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:21:53.476 --> 01:22:03.219]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:09.542]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[01:22:09.942 --> 01:22:18.785]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:22:19.165 --> 01:22:28.075]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:22:28.356 --> 01:22:32.941]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[01:22:33.381 --> 01:22:34.523]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:34.763 --> 01:22:37.266]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[01:22:37.546 --> 01:22:39.028]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[01:22:39.229 --> 01:22:44.697]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[01:22:45.038 --> 01:22:45.919]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[01:22:45.939 --> 01:22:46.300]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:53.297 --> 01:22:53.637]  Hello.
[01:22:53.957 --> 01:22:58.359]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:03.202]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[01:23:03.522 --> 01:23:08.304]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[01:23:08.564 --> 01:23:13.228]  As a homesteader attempting to live sustainably, I was floored by the amount of information in this book.
[01:23:13.268 --> 01:23:17.392]  Dear Linda, I would be hard-pressed to express how much you have impacted my life.
[01:23:17.512 --> 01:23:21.635]  I'm amazed by the wealth of the author's knowledge and the depth of the coverage in this book.
[01:23:21.835 --> 01:23:26.279]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves, this information is good to know.
[01:23:26.399 --> 01:23:28.261]  I am thankful to God for you, Linda.
[01:23:28.541 --> 01:23:30.522]  I can't say enough about this book.
[01:23:30.622 --> 01:23:32.442]  Blessings to you and your family.
[01:23:32.542 --> 01:23:38.024]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Earth's bounty everywhere.
[01:23:38.244 --> 01:23:41.265]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[01:23:41.665 --> 01:23:45.066]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[01:23:45.246 --> 01:23:49.267]  You can order online for you and your loved ones or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[01:23:56.673 --> 01:23:58.393]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:23:58.413 --> 01:23:59.054]  to 3 p.m.
[01:23:59.094 --> 01:23:59.494]  Central.
[01:23:59.554 --> 01:24:01.894]  We're here live back Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:24:02.294 --> 01:24:05.055]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:24:05.095 --> 01:24:08.736]  Ricky Ross' website is FreewayEnterprise.com.
[01:24:09.196 --> 01:24:12.556]  We'll put that up on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and radio listeners.
[01:24:12.937 --> 01:24:15.337]  We have a link up on our website, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:24:16.117 --> 01:24:19.098]  Ricky, going back though to Dark Alliance,
[01:24:19.998 --> 01:24:26.664]  The articles, the book, uh, Gary Webb, uh, I mean, all documented.
[01:24:27.265 --> 01:24:29.827]  And do you have any doubt that they murdered him?
[01:24:30.508 --> 01:24:31.849]  Man, not in my mind.
[01:24:31.869 --> 01:24:35.212]  I'm almost positive that they murdered Gary Webb.
[01:24:35.252 --> 01:24:37.414]  I mean, you know, he cut too much stuff out.
[01:24:37.434 --> 01:24:38.936]  He made them tell on themselves.
[01:24:39.476 --> 01:24:44.521]  You know, the evidence was so clear that, you know, even the CIA admitted that they knew
[01:24:45.089 --> 01:24:47.510]  That their operatives were selling drugs in this country, you know.
[01:24:47.810 --> 01:24:54.333]  Came in my situation and said, yeah, we knew that these guys were selling drugs, but we didn't sanction it.
[01:24:55.934 --> 01:25:07.559]  And that's when, you know, Congresswoman Waters came back and say, well, you know that it's your job to stop drug dealers from selling drugs in the country, and you turned the blind eye.
[01:25:09.210 --> 01:25:09.970]  I have no doubt.
[01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:16.412]  Let's get a little bit more into what happened in your trial, the type of stuff that you, your lawyer, and Gary Webb got to come out.
[01:25:17.673 --> 01:25:20.313]  Well, we found out this kind of information.
[01:25:20.353 --> 01:25:23.274]  We thought that that was enough to free me from prison.
[01:25:23.594 --> 01:25:38.779]  You know, that the CIA knew that they're operatives, because what we tried to do is we tried to use the government theory about entrapment against them, that if you're an operative, somebody that you're paying is selling drugs,
[01:25:39.477 --> 01:25:41.380]  Then, that's just like you selling drugs.
[01:25:42.061 --> 01:25:47.348]  You know, you're connected to this person from the page, so whatever he does, you're responsible for.
[01:25:47.949 --> 01:25:51.154]  And we tried to get him, from that angle, on my appeal.
[01:25:54.154 --> 01:25:55.014]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:25:55.074 --> 01:26:00.536]  I mean, clearly, and this wasn't even a sting or entrapment, they were using you to make the money.
[01:26:00.596 --> 01:26:01.596]  They were using you.
[01:26:01.917 --> 01:26:09.879]  That'd be like if a Mafia Don gives an order to a soldier to go do something, the Mafia Don's more guilty than the soldier.
[01:26:10.179 --> 01:26:12.780]  How do you send a soldier to prison and not the Don?
[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:13.920]  Absolutely.
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:21.625]  And that's the scenario that we tried to use in our case and trial that, you know, me and Alan tried to put together.
[01:26:22.665 --> 01:26:26.047]  And we got all that information via Gary's investigation.
[01:26:26.067 --> 01:26:32.951]  You know, when Gary put together and turned in, we turned around and used those same documents in court, in the federal government.
[01:26:34.071 --> 01:26:36.753]  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals said, yeah, okay.
[01:26:36.933 --> 01:26:37.893]  They were selling drugs.
[01:26:37.933 --> 01:26:39.314]  The CIA was involved.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.362]  But we're not going to excuse Ricky Ross from selling drugs, too.
[01:26:44.703 --> 01:26:57.050]  Now, a lot of evidence shows, a lot of evidence shows you've gone completely clean and that they set you up because they didn't want you running around out there because they knew Gary Webb had already been talking to you.
[01:26:57.770 --> 01:26:59.091]  Well, you know what I figured?
[01:26:59.211 --> 01:27:06.235]  And like you're saying, they felt that it would be better for me to be in prison talking about what had happened.
[01:27:06.395 --> 01:27:07.696]  It would lead to my credibility.
[01:27:08.089 --> 01:27:16.111]  You know, if you got a guy, he's from prison, and he's saying that the CIA is selling drugs, you know, or some wacko from prison, you know, saying all this stuff.
[01:27:16.851 --> 01:27:20.812]  But if a guy is on the streets saying it, you know, it gives him more credibility.
[01:27:20.852 --> 01:27:26.853]  So they felt that it would be much better to have me in prison than to have me out on the streets saying the same thing.
[01:27:28.153 --> 01:27:32.934]  Is the government putting pressure on you, or have you had any veiled or open threats to keep your mouth shut?
[01:27:33.809 --> 01:27:35.430]  No, not at this time I haven't.
[01:27:35.570 --> 01:27:39.091]  Nobody has contacted me at all about anything.
[01:27:39.331 --> 01:27:43.693]  But you know Alex, I really don't talk about it much anymore.
[01:27:44.634 --> 01:27:51.657]  I've just been trying to go on with my life and hopefully I don't wind up in the ocean or nothing like that there.
[01:27:52.421 --> 01:27:53.902]  Well, plus it's an open secret.
[01:27:53.922 --> 01:28:00.426]  They've had congressional hearings, documentaries, the cover of Esquire, CIA aircraft are always crashing full of drugs.
[01:28:00.706 --> 01:28:02.627]  I mean, I guess they just don't even care anymore.
[01:28:02.707 --> 01:28:05.949]  Okay, we bring the drugs in, your kids use it, and we put them in prison.
[01:28:06.370 --> 01:28:08.391]  Right, you're not going to, the people are not going to do anything.
[01:28:08.411 --> 01:28:11.933]  You know, they're under the feeling that, I mean, we do what we want to do.
[01:28:12.994 --> 01:28:18.057]  We lie about whatever we want to lie about, and the people keep on letting us stay in power, and people are collecting all the money.
[01:28:18.417 --> 01:28:18.877]  You know, and
[01:28:20.633 --> 01:28:38.860]  Uh, you know, I take my hat off to Gary, you know, for what he did, but I don't know many people that would put their life on the line like Gary did and knowing that nothing is going to change and our people are going to continuously allow our elected officials to continue to run a mockery of our country.
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:46.503]  And he had a new book coming out with even more damning evidence and now that book didn't get published because they shot him twice in the head with a shotgun.
[01:28:47.466 --> 01:28:48.867]  Well, you know, they took the other book.
[01:28:48.887 --> 01:28:50.728]  They didn't want to put the other book out.
[01:28:50.768 --> 01:28:52.489]  They wouldn't put any promotion behind it.
[01:28:53.269 --> 01:28:56.351]  You know, they fired him from the newspaper.
[01:28:56.371 --> 01:28:56.651]  Yes.
[01:28:57.111 --> 01:28:58.072]  I mean, from the newspaper.
[01:28:58.492 --> 01:29:01.134]  I mean, Gary was catching pretty hell from everywhere.
[01:29:01.174 --> 01:29:14.041]  You know, one of my friends, Jesse Cash from the LA Times, he come down and, you know, try to secretly do an interview with me that I felt was totally improper.
[01:29:14.641 --> 01:29:16.202]  You know, I didn't know what was going on.
[01:29:17.757 --> 01:29:20.778]  So, you know, all of them ganged up on him.
[01:29:20.898 --> 01:29:22.819]  And I thought that it was really unfair.
[01:29:23.259 --> 01:29:27.701]  I thought that they should go and do an investigation and try to prove that he was right.
[01:29:28.081 --> 01:29:29.842]  But that's the way he's been proven right.
[01:29:30.182 --> 01:29:31.803]  But that's why they killed him.
[01:29:31.823 --> 01:29:33.643]  He had another book coming out to prove all that.
[01:29:34.044 --> 01:29:36.445]  Good guys get torn down by COINTELPRO.
[01:29:36.785 --> 01:29:38.005]  And that's what they did to Gary Webb.
[01:29:38.045 --> 01:29:39.446]  And he wouldn't shut up, so they killed him.
[01:29:39.646 --> 01:29:41.427]  We'll be right back with Freeway Ricky Ross.
[01:29:41.447 --> 01:29:41.967]  Stay with us.
[01:29:44.228 --> 01:29:45.128]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.628 --> 01:29:47.129]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:48.144 --> 01:29:50.926]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:54.788 --> 01:29:58.470]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:29:58.810 --> 01:30:01.811]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:30:02.052 --> 01:30:06.854]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:30:07.194 --> 01:30:13.118]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:30:13.138 --> 01:30:15.479]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:30:15.999 --> 01:30:16.299]  Tim Geithner?
[01:30:16.319 --> 01:30:16.740]  Bernanke?
[01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:17.460]  They're arsonists!
[01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:18.761]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:30:18.781 --> 01:30:21.023]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:30:34.912 --> 01:30:38.857]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[01:30:39.298 --> 01:30:41.881]  we have seen a fall of the republic.

[01:30:53.482 --> 01:30:58.686]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:30:58.806 --> 01:31:01.528]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:31:01.569 --> 01:31:05.992]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:31:06.893 --> 01:31:11.356]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from ImpaulWars.com.

[01:31:53.956 --> 01:31:56.557]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:56.977 --> 01:32:01.920]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:04.041]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:04.341 --> 01:32:09.163]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:09.343 --> 01:32:10.304]  How much do you want?
[01:32:10.524 --> 01:32:11.284]  When do you want it?
[01:32:11.644 --> 01:32:13.245]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:13.545 --> 01:32:14.366]  When will you need it?
[01:32:14.606 --> 01:32:16.667]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:16.807 --> 01:32:17.927]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:18.147 --> 01:32:19.468]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:19.668 --> 01:32:24.752]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:24.932 --> 01:32:28.134]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:28.515 --> 01:32:32.017]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:32.337 --> 01:32:33.338]  How much will you need?
[01:32:33.578 --> 01:32:34.179]  We don't know.
[01:32:34.479 --> 01:32:35.400]  How much do you want?
[01:32:35.580 --> 01:32:36.300]  All you can get.
[01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:37.201]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:37.681 --> 01:32:38.322]  We're good to go.
[01:32:58.223 --> 01:33:05.270]  By the way, ladies and gentlemen, Kevin Booth's film that I'm in and consulted on, American Drug War, details the fraud of the drug war.
[01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:15.660]  He's got part two of it out that's a lot more hardcore, getting into government drug dealing, how the fake drug war works, how they want to ban and restrict vitamins like they're drugs now, even vitamin C and fish oil.
[01:33:16.701 --> 01:33:18.263]  It's all covered in How Weed Won the West.
[01:33:18.303 --> 01:33:20.086]  It starts shipping the 15th of this month.
[01:33:20.166 --> 01:33:21.107]  Pre-order it today.
[01:33:21.127 --> 01:33:25.352]  You can get American Drug War half price at InfoWars.com.
[01:33:25.472 --> 01:33:32.942]  FreewayEnterprise.com is the website of Freeway Ricky Ross, probably the biggest drug dealer in West Coast history.
[01:33:33.743 --> 01:33:38.126]  Who discovered that the CIA was why he was getting cocaine cheaper than anybody else.
[01:33:38.166 --> 01:33:47.914]  And they've got similar people all over today, just like Tony Montana says in Scarface, which is based on a composite of true stories, Oliver Stone wrote that, with real drug dealers.
[01:33:47.954 --> 01:33:51.296]  He's sitting there in his hot tub and he's going, they're the banks, they've got it all figured out.
[01:33:51.577 --> 01:33:54.379]  They've been here a thousand years, they'll be here in a thousand years.
[01:33:54.699 --> 01:33:55.680]  Fly Pelican!
[01:33:56.460 --> 01:34:10.548]  And, I mean, basically, basically that's what's going on, ladies and gentlemen, and they use people like Ricky Ross, a real-life Tony Montana, except he's not out murdering people, and set him up to get him out of the way.
[01:34:10.669 --> 01:34:24.677]  Now, Ricky, you know, I've thrown out a lot of questions, I have a lot of questions here from Twitter, but anything else you want to impart to this audience of a couple million people, what you think is important, what you're currently doing, before we get into some of the listener questions?
[01:34:25.626 --> 01:34:28.410]  I think that an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure.
[01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:34.679]  I think that we've got to get out here to our kids, we've got to start talking to them, and we've got to start listening to what they're saying.
[01:34:34.759 --> 01:34:37.483]  I've been visiting a lot of these kids, these schools in the ghettos.
[01:34:38.863 --> 01:34:42.824]  Man, it's amazing that these kids come up to me after I finish talking to them and say, you know what?
[01:34:42.864 --> 01:34:44.865]  Nobody never told me to think like this kid.
[01:34:45.265 --> 01:34:49.927]  You know, basically what I'm teaching them, Alex, is that you have to take something and put it in your hand and weigh it.
[01:34:50.287 --> 01:34:56.509]  You know, you just don't take everything at face value for what the TV says, what rappers say, or what your
[01:34:57.359 --> 01:34:57.619]  I'm good.
[01:35:12.603 --> 01:35:28.252]  On the drug war, all the statistics, all the studies, European countries that have done it, if we decriminalize drugs, on average, within a decade, drug use drops by more than half, crime implodes, look what happened with alcohol prohibition, alcohol kills 300,000 people a year.
[01:35:29.032 --> 01:35:31.934]  What is your stance on drug decriminalization?
[01:35:32.694 --> 01:35:35.736]  I totally agree with you that if you take the value out of drugs,
[01:35:36.391 --> 01:35:39.935]  Then it will no longer have the attraction that it has right now.
[01:35:39.995 --> 01:35:41.737]  Right now, drug dealing has an appeal.
[01:35:42.177 --> 01:35:45.040]  You know, Alex, right now they treat me like a rock star out here on the street.
[01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:49.405]  You know, when I go places, people will come up to me and hug me.
[01:35:49.425 --> 01:35:50.506]  They want to take pictures with me.
[01:35:50.526 --> 01:35:53.590]  I've probably taken 20, 30,000 pictures since I've been home.
[01:35:53.670 --> 01:35:56.653]  I go to USC football games, they want to take pictures.
[01:35:56.693 --> 01:35:58.575]  I go to the Lakers games, they want to take pictures.
[01:35:59.438 --> 01:36:00.720]  Uh, when I go to the schools.
[01:36:01.020 --> 01:36:03.844]  So, you know, it's something wrong with that way of thinking.
[01:36:03.864 --> 01:36:09.791]  You know, when you figure that I was the drug dealer, then why would anybody want to take pictures with a guy like this here?
[01:36:09.851 --> 01:36:12.975]  It's because of the decriminalization.
[01:36:13.315 --> 01:36:14.957]  It's the glamour that goes with it.
[01:36:14.977 --> 01:36:17.140]  You know, you beat the system, you're different.
[01:36:18.337 --> 01:36:20.038]  We have to take that kind of stuff out of it.
[01:36:20.358 --> 01:36:20.898]  Exactly.
[01:36:20.978 --> 01:36:24.079]  You take the $500 billion a year in the U.S.
[01:36:24.439 --> 01:36:33.541]  connected to illegal drugs out of it, and it will disappear overnight, and we can have real communities and not have these cancers in the community, and the system knows that.
[01:36:33.941 --> 01:36:39.103]  That's why they chose the black community to put the cocaine out in it, just like they say in The Godfather.
[01:36:39.463 --> 01:36:41.043]  You know, keep it in the colored area.
[01:36:41.303 --> 01:36:41.924]  They're animals.
[01:36:42.024 --> 01:36:43.204]  Let them lose their souls.
[01:36:44.125 --> 01:36:46.888]  And on top of that, Alex, look at the prison industry.
[01:36:47.268 --> 01:36:51.172]  They have these guys, they put these guys in at 19 years old and give them 20 years.
[01:36:51.593 --> 01:36:59.521]  Then these guys work 20 years, but then on top of that, they pay them 25 cents an hour, but then they charge the taxpayer $40,000 a year per guy.
[01:36:59.982 --> 01:37:01.103]  You know, take a guy like me.
[01:37:01.123 --> 01:37:04.066]  They gave me a life sentence for selling drugs.
[01:37:04.953 --> 01:37:06.814]  I was going to live another 50 years.
[01:37:06.854 --> 01:37:17.660]  So America, taxpayers, you Alex, we've been paying $40,000 a year to keep me in prison, plus my medical bills, and then you only feed me beans and rice.
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:19.260]  Where's all this money going?
[01:37:19.701 --> 01:37:22.562]  You know, you got me in a room the size of a closet.
[01:37:22.702 --> 01:37:24.383]  The sheets probably only cost a dollar.
[01:37:25.684 --> 01:37:27.004]  Where's all the money going, Alex?
[01:37:27.125 --> 01:37:29.786]  Who's getting grieved from this prison industry?
[01:37:30.285 --> 01:37:36.171]  Well, that's what's sick, Ricky, is I know you've studied this being in there for more than 20 years, but I've looked at it in depth.
[01:37:36.932 --> 01:37:45.261]  The major global private prison industries are all owned and run by the biggest money laundering, drug dealing banks.
[01:37:46.262 --> 01:37:47.303]  Huh.
[01:37:47.403 --> 01:37:48.104]  Ain't that crazy?
[01:37:48.124 --> 01:37:49.245]  Don't they all come together?
[01:37:49.285 --> 01:37:50.687]  And then the only people that can invest
[01:37:51.437 --> 01:37:53.978]  In that company, you have to be a part of the government.
[01:37:54.158 --> 01:37:56.239]  Judge, prosecutor, police officer.
[01:37:56.619 --> 01:37:58.160]  I mean, it's like one big family.
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:37:59.480]  Everybody's benefiting.
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:00.441]  Everybody's profiting.
[01:38:01.121 --> 01:38:03.162]  Well, that's how they legalize slavery again.
[01:38:03.582 --> 01:38:08.164]  They put addictive substances out that they know people are going to get addicted to.
[01:38:08.404 --> 01:38:11.826]  They promote it in the movies like it's cool and fun and glamorous.
[01:38:12.066 --> 01:38:17.268]  And when you use it, they lock you up in their private prison owned by the kingpin drug dealers.
[01:38:20.443 --> 01:38:22.303]  You know it better than I do, and I live there.
[01:38:23.684 --> 01:38:25.685]  That's exactly the way it works, Alex.
[01:38:26.025 --> 01:38:27.526]  I don't know how you did it from out here.
[01:38:27.546 --> 01:38:29.106]  You were one of the conscious ones.
[01:38:29.467 --> 01:38:37.310]  But that's what we need the rest of our country to wake up to and know, that, you know, we can take that money that we're pumping into their pockets and start using it to educate our kids.
[01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:44.473]  Alex, you know I go to those schools, and these schools don't have the basic books that our kids need to learn.
[01:38:47.779 --> 01:38:48.439]  That's incredible.
[01:38:48.519 --> 01:39:00.566]  Ricky, I want to bring Kevin Booth up, who has interviewed you and posted it on his Sacred Cow site, who's been working with you for the last five, six, seven years in prison, was also working with Gary Webb until he got murdered.
[01:39:00.586 --> 01:39:10.391]  I want to bring Kevin up with some of his questions or stories about working with you and how great it is to now have you as a force of truth out on the street.
[01:39:11.169 --> 01:39:13.671]  Kevin is another trailblazer like Gary, man.
[01:39:13.751 --> 01:39:14.572]  Kevin gets it in.
[01:39:14.592 --> 01:39:18.095]  Kevin comes out here and believe me, Alex, I worry about him sometimes.
[01:39:18.496 --> 01:39:20.417]  He's in South Central Los Angeles.
[01:39:21.038 --> 01:39:22.920]  Game Fest in South Central Los Angeles.
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:25.402]  Little Kevin, white boy, with a camera.
[01:39:26.743 --> 01:39:27.584]  Can you believe that?
[01:39:27.964 --> 01:39:30.166]  When I saw that, I was like, Kevin, are you out of your mind?
[01:39:32.789 --> 01:39:34.070]  I can hear Kevin right now.
[01:39:35.412 --> 01:39:37.013]  Kevin, you're on with Freeway Ricky Ross.
[01:39:37.033 --> 01:39:37.874]  Good to have you here with us.
[01:39:38.054 --> 01:39:38.715]  Hey, man.
[01:39:38.955 --> 01:39:44.900]  It practically brings a tear to my eye to hear Ricky free and talking to you and everything like that, so it's a really great day.
[01:39:45.401 --> 01:39:46.502]  Kevin, tell the story.
[01:39:47.743 --> 01:39:52.708]  You rode back with Freeway Ricky Ross on the Greyhound bus for, what, 20 hours?
[01:39:52.748 --> 01:39:53.588]  What was that like?
[01:39:53.609 --> 01:39:53.909]  20 hours?
[01:39:54.409 --> 01:39:55.750]  Try practically 48 hours.
[01:39:55.791 --> 01:39:56.892]  It was about 38 hours.
[01:39:59.370 --> 01:40:13.536]  Um, I think Ricky chose the bus ride because however long if he flew, he would have only gotten out for eight hours to go to the halfway house, so he chose the bus trip so he could at least have 36 hours of freedom to go to the halfway house.
[01:40:13.996 --> 01:40:23.440]  But I think the last time I came on your show, we were all talking about how Ricky had a release date and they weren't going to adhere by it in all the games that they played.
[01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:27.021]  And I heard Ricky mention Congresswoman Waters.
[01:40:27.081 --> 01:40:28.022]  I'd like to just say,
[01:40:28.607 --> 01:40:30.048]  What a great help she was.
[01:40:30.748 --> 01:40:32.749]  She really came to bat for Ricky there at the end.
[01:40:33.269 --> 01:40:33.949]  That's right, Ricky.
[01:40:33.969 --> 01:40:35.290]  They were going to keep you in the slammer.
[01:40:35.930 --> 01:40:41.952]  Yeah, they wasn't planning on letting me out, but you know, you guys stood up, and now I'm here, and you know what I'm saying?
[01:40:42.092 --> 01:40:43.853]  I hope you guys keep me up under your wing now.
[01:40:46.294 --> 01:40:51.076]  You know, this country, they hold grudges.
[01:40:53.077 --> 01:40:53.557]  Absolutely.
[01:40:53.577 --> 01:40:55.698]  You were trying to say something when we cut you off, Ricky.
[01:40:57.637 --> 01:41:00.621]  But before Kevin started talking, you were trying to say something to Kevin.
[01:41:00.641 --> 01:41:02.082]  Do you remember what that was?
[01:41:09.102 --> 01:41:10.783]  Oh, uh, what was I saying?
[01:41:11.124 --> 01:41:12.845]  Oh, good to start the show, Kev.
[01:41:12.945 --> 01:41:17.168]  I can't remember exactly what it was, but, you know, Kevin is a trailblazer, man.
[01:41:17.228 --> 01:41:24.073]  He's out here, you know, like I was saying, he's in South Central with his cameras, and sometimes I'll be worried about him, you know what I'm saying?
[01:41:24.113 --> 01:41:25.634]  Man, you gotta be careful going over there, Kevin.
[01:41:25.674 --> 01:41:26.535]  I grew up over here.
[01:41:26.975 --> 01:41:30.298]  So, you know, they have a little white guy with a camera over here.
[01:41:32.972 --> 01:41:33.473]  Amazing.
[01:41:34.354 --> 01:41:41.181]  Kevin, you know, there's so many questions I've asked Ricky, and I want Ricky to talk more about his experience in prison, before that with the CIA.
[01:41:42.002 --> 01:41:44.145]  But, Kevin, any questions you've got for Ricky?
[01:41:44.930 --> 01:41:45.831]  Oh, you know, not really.
[01:41:45.911 --> 01:41:55.002]  I mean, we talk all the time, but it just, you know, once again, it just makes me happy to hear Ricky on the show finally and being able to express himself so well.
[01:41:55.082 --> 01:41:57.465]  No, I know, Kevin.
[01:41:57.545 --> 01:41:58.947]  Obviously, you talk to Ricky all the time.
[01:41:58.987 --> 01:41:59.768]  You guys are good friends.
[01:42:00.048 --> 01:42:03.232]  I'm saying, any interesting questions for the radio listeners?
[01:42:03.902 --> 01:42:14.230]  Well, um, you know, why don't you talk a little bit about the Halfway House experience and, you know, that whole process that you were forced to go through and how ridiculous that was.
[01:42:14.790 --> 01:42:16.751]  Oh, yeah, that's another one, Alex.
[01:42:17.532 --> 01:42:19.313]  They expect us to go out in the Halfway House.
[01:42:19.333 --> 01:42:23.276]  You know, now, every place you go, you gotta fill out a job application online, right?
[01:42:24.697 --> 01:42:28.040]  You would think that the Halfway House would have computers, right?
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:29.121]  Yes.
[01:42:29.141 --> 01:42:31.422]  So, no computers, no cell phones.
[01:42:33.177 --> 01:42:35.579]  You can only go out at a certain time and look for a job.
[01:42:35.639 --> 01:42:37.561]  I mean, total BS.
[01:42:37.941 --> 01:42:42.385]  Guess how much they make a day for holding an inmate?
[01:42:42.405 --> 01:42:42.385]  $75.
[01:42:42.765 --> 01:42:43.746]  Taxpayers' money.
[01:42:44.107 --> 01:42:46.369]  And they call these places halfway house.
[01:42:46.589 --> 01:42:47.390]  It's a total joke.
[01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:51.473]  I mean, my brother was mentally ill, and he was in what I would consider a real halfway house.
[01:42:51.513 --> 01:42:52.414]  They're actual houses.
[01:42:52.938 --> 01:42:57.122]  When I went to go see this place that they had Ricky in, these aren't halfway houses.
[01:42:57.142 --> 01:43:01.525]  These are like little mini prisons that are like just scattered all over our neighborhoods.
[01:43:01.605 --> 01:43:03.607]  I mean, this is like a little miniature prison.
[01:43:03.647 --> 01:43:06.790]  It was almost like a high school, the size of a high school.
[01:43:07.771 --> 01:43:11.774]  300 people sleeping there, just in the middle of the neighborhood.
[01:43:11.974 --> 01:43:13.095]  You know, it's incredible.
[01:43:13.115 --> 01:43:16.298]  This is like a whole other scam taking place right under our noses.
[01:43:16.738 --> 01:43:21.142]  And all the research shows, and I want Ricky to speak to this, just from personal experience,
[01:43:22.856 --> 01:43:36.221]  That when you put large populations of people in prison, especially for non-violent crime, they become colleges of crime, the people now have a record, now they're part of the criminal underworld, and this creates more and more crime.
[01:43:36.261 --> 01:43:43.404]  You know, police always send me emails and say, I'm glad we've got more people in prison than China, or the whole EU combined.
[01:43:43.824 --> 01:43:47.986]  Well, no, I'm not glad, because I know that creates a culture of crime.
[01:43:49.244 --> 01:43:49.884]  Absolutely.
[01:43:50.064 --> 01:43:54.966]  You take young guys that come in prison and they only was, you know, buying $1,000 worth of drugs.
[01:43:55.026 --> 01:44:00.367]  Now he's with a kingpin from Colombia or from Mexico or with bank robbers.
[01:44:00.768 --> 01:44:04.229]  And these older guys, they feed off of these young kids.
[01:44:04.629 --> 01:44:10.330]  You know, like for me, I fed off of them too, but I was trying to teach them the things that I've been through.
[01:44:10.350 --> 01:44:13.391]  But a lot of times in prison, that doesn't happen.
[01:44:13.431 --> 01:44:15.472]  That's why they're so concerned right now with terrorism.
[01:44:16.004 --> 01:44:19.146]  Because they know that they give these young kids so much time, Alex.
[01:44:19.606 --> 01:44:24.629]  You know, you give a kid 18, 19 years old, 20 years in prison, he's going to be bitter.
[01:44:25.610 --> 01:44:40.599]  And as we discuss in the new film, How We Won the West, there's an incarceration rate that actually the government's own research has shown, where when we hit a certain level of incarceration, it makes crime rates go up.
[01:44:42.813 --> 01:44:51.419]  Which is then more police to control more people, to make more money, to put more people in the prisons, as the military-industrial complex absorbs America.
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:57.844]  Ricky Ross, the naked body scanners, they want to put everybody through at airports, recording our naked bodies.
[01:44:58.264 --> 01:44:59.965]  I mean, we're all being trained to be prisoners.
[01:45:00.726 --> 01:45:01.206]  Absolutely.
[01:45:01.566 --> 01:45:02.987]  Absolutely.
[01:45:03.208 --> 01:45:06.370]  And if we don't stop it, Alex, if we don't stop it,
[01:45:07.478 --> 01:45:08.778]  We're not going to have any rights.
[01:45:08.818 --> 01:45:11.399]  You can tap our phones now whenever they want to.
[01:45:12.119 --> 01:45:13.740]  Your friends can come and record you.
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:15.240]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:45:15.361 --> 01:45:17.401]  I mean, what is America coming to?
[01:45:17.481 --> 01:45:19.682]  Are we becoming harmony?
[01:45:21.342 --> 01:45:21.983]  That's amazing.
[01:45:22.023 --> 01:45:26.444]  Ricky, again, how do people support what you're doing with your community programs?
[01:45:27.104 --> 01:45:28.005]  Well, they can donate money.
[01:45:29.847 --> 01:45:30.888]  We're good to go.
[01:45:48.054 --> 01:45:49.715]  I also need help with my traveling.
[01:45:49.775 --> 01:45:56.521]  You know, right now I'm putting it out of my check, you know, when I go around the country speaking to kids in different schools.
[01:45:56.862 --> 01:46:04.529]  We plan on doing a tour here in California where I go to like 20 schools and, you know, just educate the kids and I would appreciate any help that I can get.
[01:46:04.949 --> 01:46:10.494]  And anybody that would like to volunteer to come out to the schools and support would be much appreciated.
[01:46:11.328 --> 01:46:17.092]  And you're explaining to children that the drug culture is evil and designed to destroy them, correct?
[01:46:17.833 --> 01:46:26.599]  Absolutely, and that just because they feel that they're going against the government by selling drugs is just what the government have in mind.
[01:46:26.619 --> 01:46:31.282]  You know, they have a thinking that by selling drugs you're rebelling against the government.
[01:46:32.023 --> 01:46:34.124]  But that's exactly what the government wants you to think.
[01:46:34.144 --> 01:46:41.009]  It's like a reverse psychology thing that they've done to the kids, because most of the kids that get involved with drugs consider themselves rebels.
[01:46:43.192 --> 01:46:51.656]  Absolutely, and in truth, you're funding the big banks and you're allowing them to now have a pretext to control and run your life and destroy your communities.
[01:46:52.056 --> 01:47:11.486]  And I've been lucky enough to travel with Ricky on at least one of the trips that he went to, and I just want to say what an incredible effect he has to go to a place like a detention center where you've got a bunch of teenagers who, they won't listen to anybody, but when Ricky walks in the room they definitely all shut up and they listen to every word he has to say.
[01:47:12.428 --> 01:47:16.670]  Uh, really, really, uh, uh, quite moving to see it in person.
[01:47:18.571 --> 01:47:21.952]  I've got some questions here, um, from listeners.
[01:47:21.992 --> 01:47:23.653]  Here's a Twitter question, Ricky.
[01:47:24.153 --> 01:47:31.477]  What other illegal activities was your CIA supplier involved with to give himself credibility to hook you in?
[01:47:31.497 --> 01:47:34.058]  I mean, how did they keep you from knowing it was the CIA?
[01:47:40.333 --> 01:47:42.673]  Automatic, fully automatic weapons, machine guns.
[01:47:44.334 --> 01:47:48.695]  So the CIA wasn't just bringing in cocaine, they were bringing in guns.
[01:47:49.435 --> 01:47:49.995]  Absolutely.
[01:47:53.815 --> 01:47:54.456]  Unbelievable.
[01:47:54.996 --> 01:47:59.857]  And then the public gets even more scared, and they get to get more police to then control the public.
[01:48:00.757 --> 01:48:01.997]  And they got all this firepower.
[01:48:03.017 --> 01:48:05.478]  You know, remember, and then they need more time.
[01:48:05.518 --> 01:48:07.718]  Remember, they increased the minimum mandatory.
[01:48:08.499 --> 01:48:11.021]  Well, now we need minimum mandatory so we can put them in prison longer.
[01:48:11.541 --> 01:48:13.622]  Because these guys are more violent than they used to be.
[01:48:15.163 --> 01:48:16.184]  Well, you know, that's... We gave them guns!
[01:48:16.584 --> 01:48:29.551]  That's come out in Florida, the CIA was supplying, and I knew in Texas, but... So this CIA handler, and this came out in hearings and in court, folks, was also supplying weapons, which was... They used to sell me weapons.
[01:48:30.432 --> 01:48:33.794]  Didn't they used to have a front as, like, some sort of car place or something?
[01:48:33.834 --> 01:48:35.215]  Some sort of car dealership?
[01:48:35.805 --> 01:48:42.009]  They had a car dealership, they had a security thing where they did security for different people.
[01:48:42.049 --> 01:48:44.030]  You know, they had a bunch of different fronts.
[01:48:48.713 --> 01:48:56.778]  Ricky, so this whole time you were working for them, they kept it secret that they were CIA, or did you ever hear that, or did you ever wonder?
[01:48:57.319 --> 01:48:58.099]  No, I never knew.
[01:48:58.119 --> 01:49:01.321]  I never had a clue.
[01:49:02.582 --> 01:49:05.104]  Only thing that I knew, Alex, is that they were fighting a war
[01:49:05.865 --> 01:49:06.565]  In their country.
[01:49:07.766 --> 01:49:08.426]  I didn't know that.
[01:49:08.526 --> 01:49:09.507]  I knew that much about it.
[01:49:09.567 --> 01:49:11.408]  That's what they had told me many times.
[01:49:11.448 --> 01:49:12.448]  That's why they sold drugs.
[01:49:13.088 --> 01:49:16.290]  Oh, so they admitted to you that they were funding a war in their country?
[01:49:16.930 --> 01:49:17.150]  Right.
[01:49:17.310 --> 01:49:18.011]  They admitted that.
[01:49:18.211 --> 01:49:19.972]  Now, where the war was at, I didn't know that.
[01:49:20.012 --> 01:49:21.552]  I didn't know anything about Nicaragua.
[01:49:21.572 --> 01:49:25.374]  I knew nothing about Contra, nor the CIA at that time.
[01:49:28.095 --> 01:49:31.337]  Did you know how they were getting the drugs into Southern California?
[01:49:32.077 --> 01:49:32.237]  Nope.
[01:49:32.518 --> 01:49:33.318]  They wouldn't tell me that.
[01:49:35.131 --> 01:49:36.952]  Well, you know, he was a racist and a bigot, too.
[01:49:38.652 --> 01:49:38.952]  Really?
[01:49:39.633 --> 01:49:40.013]  Oh, yeah.
[01:49:40.373 --> 01:49:47.596]  Yeah, Gary found a tape that they had where he said, just like you said, you know, give it to the end.
[01:49:48.016 --> 01:49:49.676]  You know, nobody cares what happens to him.
[01:49:50.517 --> 01:50:01.421]  Yeah, I think there's that soundbite of him actually in American Drug War where he says, you know, I hate the ends, but they deal in cash, so let's use them.
[01:50:01.441 --> 01:50:02.481]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:50:02.561 --> 01:50:04.202]  I think you hit it right on the head, Kevin.
[01:50:05.563 --> 01:50:10.705]  And again, folks, you can get American Drug War and How the Weed Won the West at Infowars.com.
[01:50:10.725 --> 01:50:11.585]  This film is out.
[01:50:11.925 --> 01:50:18.307]  You can get it at half price when you order How Weed Won the West, which comes out in 12 days at Infowars.com.
[01:50:18.527 --> 01:50:19.347]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:50:19.908 --> 01:50:20.608]  And Alex, guess what?
[01:50:20.648 --> 01:50:22.688]  The courts wouldn't let us play that tape to the jury.
[01:50:23.269 --> 01:50:28.190]  They let this guy testify against me and said that that tape had absolutely nothing to do with his testimony.
[01:50:29.851 --> 01:50:32.932]  Him saying we're dealing drugs to the N-words.
[01:50:33.612 --> 01:50:33.832]  Right.
[01:50:34.682 --> 01:50:36.003]  And don't nobody care about him.
[01:50:38.926 --> 01:50:39.746]  And that he didn't like him.
[01:50:39.766 --> 01:50:43.910]  Because I never heard the tape because the judge wouldn't let us play the tape in court.
[01:50:44.210 --> 01:50:52.116]  Well, for 150 years it's been on record that the prostitution, the gambling, the drug dealing is allowed in the poor areas, especially the black areas.
[01:50:52.136 --> 01:50:52.737]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:58.922]  Our economy is in great distress.
[01:50:59.543 --> 01:51:02.325]  The financial dominoes can fall at any time.
[01:51:03.055 --> 01:51:07.778]  It's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen and prepare just in case it does.
[01:51:08.579 --> 01:51:10.380]  You have auto and home insurance.
[01:51:11.241 --> 01:51:13.322]  Why wouldn't you have food insurance?
[01:51:14.443 --> 01:51:17.125]  Are you prepared to feed your family long term?
[01:51:17.745 --> 01:51:19.606]  Because it might take years to recover.
[01:51:20.407 --> 01:51:26.071]  As the adult, it's your responsibility to feed your family, especially during rough times.
[01:51:26.929 --> 01:51:34.233]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is offering a package that will give you a 3-acre heirloom vegetable garden anywhere.

[01:51:56.244 --> 01:51:59.890]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:52:00.271 --> 01:52:03.276]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:52:03.516 --> 01:52:04.939]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:52:05.638 --> 01:52:08.319]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:52:09.060 --> 01:52:14.542]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:52:14.702 --> 01:52:19.744]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:52:20.245 --> 01:52:29.869]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:52:29.989 --> 01:52:32.090]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:52:32.330 --> 01:52:33.670]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:52:33.930 --> 01:52:36.191]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:52:36.391 --> 01:52:38.211]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:52:38.511 --> 01:52:43.312]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:53:54.141 --> 01:54:03.966]  In two years of his career as one of the biggest drug dealers in US history,
[01:54:17.065 --> 01:54:28.148]  Ricky Ross made 500 million dollars, or 500 million conservatively, went through his hands, and he was just one of the larger conduits to put it on the street.
[01:54:29.049 --> 01:54:32.550]  They only bust the middle size and small drug dealers.
[01:54:33.430 --> 01:54:37.171]  80 plus percent of illegal drug users only use marijuana.
[01:54:38.411 --> 01:54:49.357]  If you decriminalize that, it wounds their phony drug war that the drug cartels, controlled by our government, are taking over the planet with.
[01:54:51.098 --> 01:54:59.023]  If you decriminalize, you shut off the CIA's main funding mechanism and the fake war they're using to take over America.
[01:54:59.323 --> 01:55:00.904]  Your comments on that, Ricky Ross.
[01:55:01.804 --> 01:55:05.967]  He's got guys talking to him in the background.
[01:55:08.561 --> 01:55:08.801]  Yeah.
[01:55:09.181 --> 01:55:12.463]  What would it do to the CIA if we decriminalized drugs?
[01:55:13.644 --> 01:55:15.745]  Oh man, it would take a big bite out of their budget.
[01:55:16.705 --> 01:55:22.248]  You know, they couldn't no longer raise funds that Congress and the rest of the country knows about.
[01:55:22.689 --> 01:55:26.851]  You know, with illegal drugs, they can get money that's non-traceable.
[01:55:27.011 --> 01:55:28.812]  You know, nobody knows where it comes from.
[01:55:28.872 --> 01:55:32.514]  Nobody knows that this person was paid off or that person was paid off.
[01:55:32.554 --> 01:55:33.995]  You know, it's just free money.
[01:55:34.761 --> 01:55:41.423]  Three weeks ago, Ron Paul gave a speech documenting that the CIA has had a coup in America and already runs our country.
[01:55:43.324 --> 01:55:45.064]  Yeah, I wouldn't doubt that.
[01:55:45.804 --> 01:55:47.405]  I believe that that's probably true.
[01:55:48.605 --> 01:55:54.487]  I mean, because the people are not standing up, you know, and until the people take charge, you know, somebody's gonna run it.
[01:55:55.387 --> 01:55:58.008]  And, you know, the people with money, you know, that's what they want money for.
[01:55:58.693 --> 01:56:08.239]  But it's so obvious that criminal elements in government made drugs illegal because their alcohol prohibition had ended, and they wanted a new black market to take over with.
[01:56:09.700 --> 01:56:10.100]  I agree.
[01:56:10.260 --> 01:56:11.261]  I totally agree with that.
[01:56:11.621 --> 01:56:14.262]  And drugs was the perfect venue for that.
[01:56:15.883 --> 01:56:21.346]  And we're now 70 plus years in the drug war, and the bigger the drug war gets, Ricky, the more drugs we got on the street.
[01:56:21.387 --> 01:56:21.887]  Why is that?
[01:56:22.932 --> 01:56:25.273]  Well, I mean, it's like this here, Alex.
[01:56:25.353 --> 01:56:27.995]  There's no way that they can win this drug war.
[01:56:28.055 --> 01:56:31.557]  Drugs... If somebody wants to get high, Alex, they're gonna get high.
[01:56:31.597 --> 01:56:35.499]  You know, a guy OD'd when I was in the hole at a maximum security prison.
[01:56:35.879 --> 01:56:37.140]  A guy OD'd in the hole.
[01:56:37.340 --> 01:56:38.541]  He's in a cell by himself.
[01:56:39.041 --> 01:56:40.522]  No other inmate contact.
[01:56:41.162 --> 01:56:42.003]  How did this happen?
[01:56:42.783 --> 01:56:44.304]  How could he be in the hole and OD'd?
[01:56:44.584 --> 01:56:46.225]  The jail guards are selling him the drugs.
[01:56:47.146 --> 01:56:47.926]  Exactly.
[01:56:48.346 --> 01:56:49.627]  Somebody's gonna get it to him.
[01:56:49.927 --> 01:56:51.348]  And usually it's the people of authority.
[01:56:53.424 --> 01:57:02.297]  Which is why they want to keep it illegal, and they want to get 50% of kids, according to the New Freedom Initiative, on Prozac and Ritalin, which are even more dangerous than other narcotics.
[01:57:02.921 --> 01:57:04.381]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[01:57:04.881 --> 01:57:16.904]  And a lot of the drugs, and it's been proven too that children who take those drugs at an early age will be more susceptible to becoming addicted to things like crystal meth, cocaine, crack, and on and on.
[01:57:17.084 --> 01:57:22.706]  Well it's so obvious, and the government is a bunch of drug dealing crooks who want to make us all drug addicts.
[01:57:23.426 --> 01:57:25.346]  The only thing we can do is decriminalize now.
[01:57:25.586 --> 01:57:28.847]  Look at Mexico collapsing, Ricky Ross, because of the drug war.
[01:57:29.747 --> 01:57:31.808]  Exactly, and the drug lords run the country.
[01:57:33.052 --> 01:57:34.132]  Because they have all the money.
[01:57:35.593 --> 01:57:37.673]  They're draining all the money out of the economy.
[01:57:38.373 --> 01:57:40.154]  And the same thing is happening here in America.
[01:57:40.594 --> 01:57:44.795]  I mean, the people, the black market is killing us all the way around.
[01:57:46.535 --> 01:57:49.156]  That's how the British brought down China was bringing drugs in.
[01:57:49.796 --> 01:57:51.596]  Yeah, nobody wins from a drug war.
[01:57:52.676 --> 01:57:53.917]  I'm totally convinced of that.
[01:57:53.937 --> 01:57:57.958]  There's no way that anybody wins except the authorities.
[01:57:58.798 --> 01:57:59.438]  The bankers.
[01:58:00.638 --> 01:58:01.218]  And the banker.
[01:58:02.298 --> 01:58:03.159]  Which are the authority?
[01:58:04.259 --> 01:58:14.061]  They're going to continue to push this makeshift war on us and keep stealing the money out of our education system and all the other places that need money.
[01:58:14.361 --> 01:58:15.442]  They're going to continue to rob them.
[01:58:18.062 --> 01:58:19.923]  Ricky, fire out your website for folks.

[01:59:46.485 --> 01:59:48.386]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:48.866 --> 01:59:51.668]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.728 --> 02:00:07.930]  FreewayEnterprises.com, FreewayEnterprise.com, Ricky Ross is our guest.
[02:00:08.270 --> 02:00:15.593]  We'll put his website up on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, so when they're on the web, they'll know the bonafide Ricky Ross website.
[02:00:16.554 --> 02:00:18.615]  Really is a pop legend.
[02:00:19.395 --> 02:00:34.625]  And we just appreciate that he's here with us fighting the New World Order, exposing the drug war for what it is, because in How Weed Won the West that we're selling at Infowars.com, Kevin went and interviewed street drug dealers that do not want the marijuana dispensaries, they do not want it decriminalized.
[02:00:35.326 --> 02:00:41.810]  You know, the ground-level drug dealers, not just of marijuana, but other more hardcore drugs, they want to keep it illegal, don't they, Ricky?
[02:00:42.410 --> 02:00:43.071]  Absolutely.
[02:00:43.151 --> 02:00:46.213]  I mean, when you start legalizing it, you cut into their money.
[02:00:46.833 --> 02:00:48.074]  And they don't want that to happen.
[02:00:49.874 --> 02:01:04.741]  As you were saying earlier, 80% of all illegal drug users only smoke marijuana, so if you take all those people and they start going to these illegal dispensaries, then you're destroying the whole market for all sides of the fraud.
[02:01:04.761 --> 02:01:10.384]  And Alex, when you take all that money out of it, you also take the violence out.
[02:01:10.704 --> 02:01:14.646]  Because most of the violence comes from people trying to rob the people with all the money.
[02:01:15.734 --> 02:01:18.695]  Because it costs so much and they can't legally get it.
[02:01:18.795 --> 02:01:19.995]  And this is well known.
[02:01:20.395 --> 02:01:24.036]  The British took down China on record by bringing opium in.
[02:01:24.416 --> 02:01:25.636]  The government had it illegal.
[02:01:25.996 --> 02:01:31.098]  They brought it in, bought off the cities, took over the whole country, and then broke China up in 11 pieces.
[02:01:31.578 --> 02:01:33.318]  The globalists are doing this now.
[02:01:33.618 --> 02:01:36.539]  CIA got caught in Vietnam bringing in the opium.
[02:01:37.219 --> 02:01:38.860]  Ricky Ross, look at Afghanistan.
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:47.605]  Now it's 13 times the previous record level of heroin pouring out into the world with the CIA and the Pentagon openly protecting it.
[02:01:48.565 --> 02:01:54.609]  I saw that on the news a few times a couple years ago, Howard, since we went over and took over the country that it's gotten worse.
[02:01:55.409 --> 02:01:56.950]  I mean, that's just another example.
[02:01:57.550 --> 02:01:58.971]  But now what are we going to do, Alex?
[02:01:59.071 --> 02:02:00.212]  Are we just going to sit around?
[02:02:00.252 --> 02:02:03.434]  Are our people going to stand up and take the White House back?
[02:02:04.649 --> 02:02:09.152]  Right now here in Los Angeles, they're trying to shut down the thousand legal dispensaries we have.
[02:02:09.172 --> 02:02:17.897]  They're trying to get it down to like 70 or something, which is going to create this incredible consolidation and make some of the dispensaries are, you know, it's going to drive the price.
[02:02:17.917 --> 02:02:22.580]  It won't be able to supply the market and then the illegalness will continue and the crime will continue.
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:24.861]  Ricky, you're talking about education too.
[02:02:25.221 --> 02:02:28.383]  The hundreds of billions in the fake drug war into education.
[02:02:29.138 --> 02:02:29.699]  Absolutely.
[02:02:29.739 --> 02:02:33.685]  I mean, if we educate the people, then they won't need to go out and use drugs.
[02:02:33.725 --> 02:02:35.688]  Most people that use drugs are uneducated.
[02:02:36.348 --> 02:02:40.531]  Kevin, you're going to have a screening of How Weed Won the West, which isn't out until the 15th.
[02:02:40.591 --> 02:02:43.493]  Ships here on DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:02:43.513 --> 02:02:44.514]  You are having a viewing.
[02:02:44.554 --> 02:02:45.474]  Tell folks real fast.
[02:02:45.614 --> 02:02:45.774]  Right.
[02:02:45.794 --> 02:02:48.056]  This is at the Organica Dispensary.
[02:02:48.316 --> 02:02:49.497]  That's actually in the film.
[02:02:49.537 --> 02:02:50.778]  It gets busted in the film.
[02:02:50.978 --> 02:02:54.900]  And this is on Saturday, February 13th around 7 p.m.
[02:02:54.940 --> 02:03:00.644]  It's in Venice Beach on 13456 Washington Boulevard in Venice.
[02:03:00.704 --> 02:03:01.965]  Organica Dispensary.
[02:03:02.225 --> 02:03:02.626]  February 13th.
[02:03:03.346 --> 02:03:12.510]  All right, and what's worse is, these are legal under state law, but the feds come in and beat them up and smash, and then steal the money in the weed, and you never even hear where it went.
[02:03:12.530 --> 02:03:17.592]  I mean, the feds are so corrupt, and the locals are doing it now, they just openly keep the money.
[02:03:20.132 --> 02:03:22.753]  Yeah, I mean, it's in your face.
[02:03:22.874 --> 02:03:23.634]  That's all you can say.
[02:03:23.714 --> 02:03:24.814]  Richie, last question.
[02:03:24.854 --> 02:03:31.637]  From your deep research on this, I mean, just experiencing it, what percentage of cops, on average, would you say are crooked, that are involved in narcotics?
[02:03:32.282 --> 02:03:33.242]  Oh man, there's so many of them.
[02:03:33.262 --> 02:03:36.803]  You know, my whole task force, you know, I took down 35 crooked cops.
[02:03:36.883 --> 02:03:39.223]  They were robbing us, planting drugs on us.
[02:03:39.523 --> 02:03:46.865]  You know, they came up with a game that if they come in your house and you have a bunch of money, the easiest way to get you not to claim the money is to plant some drugs on you.
[02:03:47.385 --> 02:03:50.446]  You know, because drug dealers had stopped keeping money and drugs in the same house.
[02:03:50.466 --> 02:03:54.286]  Because they knew that if they didn't have any drugs there, the money was okay.
[02:03:55.127 --> 02:04:01.748]  Yeah, that's something we didn't go into is the Ricky Ross Task Force and the fact that some of the guys on the Ricky Ross Task Force are still in jail.
[02:04:02.321 --> 02:04:11.645]  Look, look, we're out of time, but Ricky, I want to have you back up just to tell some of the incredible war stories and corrupt cop stories that you witness.
[02:04:11.885 --> 02:04:13.386]  Can we do that in a month or so?
[02:04:14.086 --> 02:04:14.867]  You call me Alex.
[02:04:14.947 --> 02:04:16.347]  Anytime you call me, I'll be there.
[02:04:16.407 --> 02:04:17.108]  Wherever it's at.
[02:04:17.808 --> 02:04:22.870]  As long as the government let me come, you know I'm still on parole, so I have to get permission from them to travel.
[02:04:23.310 --> 02:04:24.791]  But call me and I'm coming.
[02:04:25.742 --> 02:04:26.963]  We're going to have you back on soon.
[02:04:27.023 --> 02:04:30.105]  Kevin's back on next week with some other witnesses to the drug war.
[02:04:30.406 --> 02:04:35.530]  FreewayEnterprise.com, get how we won the West in American Drug War at Infowars.com.
[02:04:35.850 --> 02:04:40.553]  Ricky Ross, Kevin Booth, thank you both for coming on and having the courage to do what you're doing.
[02:04:41.134 --> 02:04:43.376]  Thanks Alex for having us and you keep doing what you're doing.
[02:04:43.396 --> 02:04:44.356]  You're fighting a good war.
[02:04:44.757 --> 02:04:50.501]  I just hope that your listeners take action and let's take this country back, you know what I'm saying, and put it back the way it's supposed to be.
[02:04:50.681 --> 02:04:51.302]  Absolutely.
[02:04:51.342 --> 02:04:51.982]  God bless you.
[02:04:52.022 --> 02:04:52.623]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:53.510 --> 02:05:00.355]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.

[02:05:53.257 --> 02:05:57.498]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:57.799 --> 02:05:58.419]  Number one.
[02:05:58.719 --> 02:06:01.880]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:02.140 --> 02:06:02.700]  Number two.
[02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:07.562]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:07.902 --> 02:06:08.342]  It's true.
[02:06:08.642 --> 02:06:13.184]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:13.504 --> 02:06:14.045]  Number 3.
[02:06:14.325 --> 02:06:17.628]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:17.908 --> 02:06:21.651]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:21.831 --> 02:06:22.372]  Number 4.
[02:06:22.632 --> 02:06:25.014]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:25.394 --> 02:06:28.797]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:29.077 --> 02:06:29.278]  Number 5.
[02:06:29.858 --> 02:06:33.780]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:38.763]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:06:39.043 --> 02:06:43.085]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:43.225 --> 02:06:44.786]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:45.006 --> 02:06:49.528]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:06:55.026 --> 02:06:55.506]  Hi, neighbor.
[02:06:55.827 --> 02:06:58.548]  They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[02:06:59.129 --> 02:07:03.852]  Certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was none left at any price.
[02:07:04.392 --> 02:07:09.535]  We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those unable to care for themselves.
[02:07:10.136 --> 02:07:17.240]  We would intend not to be standing in the breadline with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue.
[02:07:17.741 --> 02:07:22.624]  If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the breadline may have no bread.
[02:07:23.257 --> 02:07:30.300]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us.
[02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:35.502]  Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future.
[02:07:36.203 --> 02:07:36.483]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:07:36.503 --> 02:07:36.543]  800-409-5633.
[02:07:36.563 --> 02:07:37.463]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:37.483 --> 02:07:37.663]  Who am I?
[02:07:37.683 --> 02:07:38.324]  Someone who cares.
[02:07:55.385 --> 02:08:01.410]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:02.010 --> 02:08:04.993]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:07.540 --> 02:08:10.623]  We are going to plumb the depths of evil.
[02:08:11.764 --> 02:08:13.205]  The mindset of the elite.
[02:08:13.605 --> 02:08:15.367]  They don't just bring the narcotics in.
[02:08:15.647 --> 02:08:21.332]  They don't just push Ritalin and Prozac and other deadly drugs on kids and pregnant women and dangerous vaccines.
[02:08:22.052 --> 02:08:23.754]  They revel in corruption.
[02:08:23.774 --> 02:08:29.638]  They revel in who can be the most wicked, the most evil, the most psychopathic, the most sociopathic.
[02:08:30.559 --> 02:08:34.663]  Depleted uranium is used at proving sites all over the United States and all over the world.
[02:08:35.871 --> 02:08:47.627]  It's now being used in even smaller rifle munitions, not just Abrams tank sabot rounds or Vulcan warthog cannons in A-10s or in Hellfire missiles.
[02:08:47.707 --> 02:08:49.930]  It's being put into most munitions now.
[02:08:50.931 --> 02:09:05.996]  And the troops are dying, they've known for decades, it's causing deformities, just like they knew in secret reports that have been declassified recently, in the 60s that Agent Orange was going to literally fry the testicles of men and make them have deformed children.
[02:09:07.016 --> 02:09:09.697]  And, I mean, this is what's going on.
[02:09:09.737 --> 02:09:14.379]  We're going to talk to Dr. Doug Rocky here in a moment, who literally wrote the Army manuals
[02:09:15.356 --> 02:09:16.456]  for them on D.U.
[02:09:16.537 --> 02:09:17.837]  They know what they're doing.
[02:09:18.117 --> 02:09:19.458]  They don't care about our troops.
[02:09:19.778 --> 02:09:22.879]  They say caring about the troops is putting them in all these fraudulent wars.
[02:09:23.359 --> 02:09:24.540]  So I want to get into what D.U.'
[02:09:24.520 --> 02:09:24.860]  's doing.
[02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:26.581]  The Iraqi government's suing the U.S.
[02:09:26.661 --> 02:09:29.742]  over this, and we haven't talked to Dr. Raki in over a year.
[02:09:29.802 --> 02:09:31.363]  I want to get all the latest developments from him.
[02:09:31.583 --> 02:09:34.244]  Before we go to Dr. Doug Raki for the balance of the hour,
[02:09:35.805 --> 02:09:40.946]  I want to go over some of the sponsors that have made this radio show possible and who I really believe in.
[02:09:41.346 --> 02:09:42.527]  One of them is Ecolablue.
[02:09:42.987 --> 02:09:44.207]  Ecolablue.com.
[02:09:45.187 --> 02:09:54.170]  And they have great atmospheric water generators, big ones that can supply hundreds or even thousands of people, little ones that do seven and a half, eight gallons a day, Ecolablue 30, Ecolablue 28.
[02:09:54.350 --> 02:09:59.351]  They've already shipped one of their giant units and a bunch of small ones with a convoy of hope to Haiti.
[02:09:59.731 --> 02:10:02.772]  Twenty percent of your purchase goes towards that.

[02:10:10.957 --> 02:10:13.518]  Reverse osmosis carbon keeps it in a stainless steel tank.
[02:10:13.839 --> 02:10:14.679]  Grabs it out of the air.
[02:10:14.739 --> 02:10:16.440]  The Acola Blue 30 has 12 filters.
[02:10:17.281 --> 02:10:18.882]  They've got a bunch of special deals running.
[02:10:18.902 --> 02:10:20.523]  Acolablue.com or 800-691-6043.
[02:10:20.543 --> 02:10:20.583]  800-691-6043.
[02:10:25.366 --> 02:10:28.110]  6043.
[02:10:25.406 --> 02:10:28.110]  Another sponsor is efoodsdirect.com.
[02:10:28.150 --> 02:10:32.154]  The highest quality, storable foods available bar none.
[02:10:32.175 --> 02:10:36.740]  They have ready-to-eat, gourmet-style meals, non-GMO.

[02:10:38.602 --> 02:10:39.964]  They have just so many.
[02:10:40.184 --> 02:10:42.567]  This is the place to get food, and they make it new every month.
[02:10:43.168 --> 02:10:45.209]  You know, this stuff's usually just a few weeks old when you get it.
[02:10:46.349 --> 02:10:47.210]  The max a month.
[02:10:47.230 --> 02:10:48.891]  I mean, this is the big dog.
[02:10:48.931 --> 02:10:50.111]  This is the quality people.
[02:10:50.471 --> 02:10:59.115]  I did research for my own preparedness, because I don't trust the system for the depression and the rest of it, and this is who I went with, and this is who I'm happy with, because I tried some others that didn't like it.
[02:10:59.495 --> 02:11:00.536]  efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.

[02:11:09.509 --> 02:11:14.210]  And finally, I want to plug FrontSite.com, like the front of your rifle.
[02:11:14.250 --> 02:11:19.431]  It's not enough to have a bunch of ammo and guns to protect yourself from criminals and government and all the stuff that's going on.
[02:11:19.451 --> 02:11:20.371]  You need to be trained.
[02:11:20.871 --> 02:11:22.331]  And it's out in Pahrump, Nevada.
[02:11:22.931 --> 02:11:25.112]  It's the biggest private firearms training facility.
[02:11:25.152 --> 02:11:27.112]  No drill instructor, tough guy attitudes.
[02:11:27.572 --> 02:11:28.232]  It's family.
[02:11:28.972 --> 02:11:30.573]  And it's FrontSite.com.
[02:11:30.613 --> 02:11:37.554]  You can get five days of world-class gun training, very inexpensive, and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit and
[02:11:38.214 --> 02:11:41.655]  Get a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:11:41.975 --> 02:11:43.175]  FrontSite.com.
[02:11:43.415 --> 02:11:45.476]  That's FrontSite.com.
[02:11:45.656 --> 02:11:45.956]  Okay.
[02:11:47.656 --> 02:11:49.497]  Going to Dr. Doug Rocky.
[02:11:50.397 --> 02:11:59.239]  What this evil system does is it uses its authority of the government and the system to do outrageous things and then just set the precedent.
[02:11:59.839 --> 02:12:02.240]  Government's caught drug dealing literally thousands of times.
[02:12:02.980 --> 02:12:04.080]  The drug war continues.
[02:12:04.621 --> 02:12:05.961]  But though people are starting to wake up.
[02:12:06.843 --> 02:12:10.248]  The government's caught engaged in all forms of corruption.
[02:12:10.348 --> 02:12:11.330]  The banks are robbing us.
[02:12:11.350 --> 02:12:12.131]  They just continue.
[02:12:12.972 --> 02:12:14.915]  The vaccine makers are caught maiming people.
[02:12:14.955 --> 02:12:16.097]  The corruption continues.
[02:12:17.439 --> 02:12:20.683]  The DU being used all over the world now.
[02:12:22.028 --> 02:12:23.789]  And improving grounds all over the U.S.
[02:12:23.989 --> 02:12:25.329]  So incredibly deadly.
[02:12:25.369 --> 02:12:27.250]  And they knew in the late 40s it was deadly.
[02:12:27.610 --> 02:12:35.873]  They knew in the 80s and the early 90s when Dr. Doug Rocky wrote the book, the manual for the Pentagon and the Army, they knew how deadly it was.
[02:12:36.574 --> 02:12:44.937]  And now they just say, look, when we attack a military base in Iraq or somewhere, we move troops in a week later, have them move right in next to blast points with the D.U.
[02:12:45.777 --> 02:12:51.202]  We have people without protective gear clearing up tanks and stuff we've destroyed with it, knowing it's going to really hurt them.
[02:12:51.823 --> 02:12:58.369]  And it's hurt Dr. Rockey, many of his colleagues have died just involved in studying this stuff and in cleanups.
[02:12:58.770 --> 02:13:02.213]  So this gives you a window into the minds of the controllers.
[02:13:02.573 --> 02:13:04.856]  Dr. Doug Rockey is a depleted uranium expert.
[02:13:05.456 --> 02:13:05.896]  A B.S.
[02:13:05.936 --> 02:13:09.698]  in Physics at the Western Illinois University, followed by his M.S.
[02:13:09.738 --> 02:13:10.238]  and Ph.D.
[02:13:10.278 --> 02:13:12.719]  in Physics and Technology Education at the University of Illinois.
[02:13:13.119 --> 02:13:20.042]  His military career has spanned four decades, to include combat duty during Vietnam and Gulf War I. He served as a member of the 3rd U.S.
[02:13:20.122 --> 02:13:26.944]  Army Medical Command's Nuclear Biological Chemical Teaching, Medical Response, and Special Operations Team, 3rd U.S.
[02:13:27.044 --> 02:13:30.025]  Army Captured Equipment Project Team, and with the 3rd U.S.
[02:13:30.125 --> 02:13:34.007]  Army Uranium Assessment Team, Gulf War Operation Desert Storm.
[02:13:34.747 --> 02:13:36.107]  This thing's five pages long, folks.
[02:13:36.468 --> 02:13:37.148]  He was the U.S.
[02:13:37.228 --> 02:13:39.648]  Army's depleted uranium project director from 94 to 95.
[02:13:40.489 --> 02:13:43.850]  He developed the congressionally mandated education training manuals and wrote the U.S.
[02:13:43.930 --> 02:13:45.250]  Army Regulation 700-48, the U.S.
[02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:47.051]  Army PAM 700-48, and the U.S.
[02:13:47.151 --> 02:13:48.611]  Army's command task for DU.
[02:13:51.992 --> 02:13:52.372]  Incidents.
[02:13:52.392 --> 02:13:56.736]  He is the DU expert and they won't even allow the manuals to be given to officers and troops.
[02:13:57.016 --> 02:13:58.697]  They march them in to die.
[02:13:59.218 --> 02:14:00.759]  That's who your government is.
[02:14:00.999 --> 02:14:04.662]  So don't give me, when I'm against new wars, that I don't care about the troops.
[02:14:05.022 --> 02:14:07.044]  Killing our troops isn't taking care of them.
[02:14:07.224 --> 02:14:11.387]  And the murderers that run this system wrap themselves in our troops' heroism.
[02:14:11.667 --> 02:14:14.988]  I'm sorry I'm ranting, Dr. Rockey, and I want you to get out the websites.
[02:14:15.048 --> 02:14:17.809]  I mean, I literally didn't even get into your bio here.
[02:14:17.849 --> 02:14:22.130]  There's so much, but just to watch this evil set the precedent.
[02:14:22.450 --> 02:14:27.511]  I mean, what is it like for you to see this, the use of DU, going wild?
[02:14:28.171 --> 02:14:40.354]  Well, I mean, it's a continuous thing, considering that the United States Army friendly fire casualties from Operation Desert Storm, who became casualties as a direct result of the use of uranium
[02:14:41.431 --> 02:14:42.051]  We're good to go.
[02:15:08.007 --> 02:15:12.610]  He wrote the original order mandating medical care, environmental cleanup, and training in 1993.
[02:15:12.690 --> 02:15:19.174]  He signed the Army Regulation that I wrote that you already quoted, and we're not getting the care that we earned.
[02:15:19.994 --> 02:15:20.835]  It's real simple.
[02:15:21.315 --> 02:15:24.137]  They just do not want to provide medical care to U.S.
[02:15:24.177 --> 02:15:33.102]  military personnel, because you have to understand the million or so casualties we have now from the nonsense of the Persian Gulf are not as a result of bullets and bombs.
[02:15:33.562 --> 02:15:37.565]  They are the result of toxic exposures, primarily uranium munitions,
[02:15:38.584 --> 02:15:42.467]  Oil well fires, pesticides, hazardous materials, and everything else.
[02:15:42.787 --> 02:15:49.212]  And blowing up Kamasia, one of the biggest chemical weapons dumps in the world, and they know, and they just don't care.
[02:15:49.653 --> 02:15:52.415]  But you have to understand, Kamasia was only one that we blew up.
[02:15:52.435 --> 02:15:53.776]  We blew up 105 of them.
[02:15:54.336 --> 02:16:00.521]  We made the decision to blow up all the chemical and biological weapons facilities that Iraq possessed in December of 1990.
[02:16:02.043 --> 02:16:04.445]  And that was because we, the U.S.
[02:16:04.505 --> 02:16:06.046]  military, and specifically the U.S.
[02:16:06.126 --> 02:16:08.767]  Army, gave them anthrax, weaponized anthrax.
[02:16:09.408 --> 02:16:10.909]  So we had to destroy it in place.
[02:16:11.409 --> 02:16:17.833]  And if anybody has any questions as to whether or not we did it or not, all they have to do is go to General Norman Schwarzkopf's autobiography.
[02:16:18.414 --> 02:16:21.296]  It doesn't take a hero, and go to page 390 and read about it.
[02:16:22.016 --> 02:16:24.658]  The arrogance of these guys is beyond comprehension.
[02:16:26.314 --> 02:16:30.397]  And then they did the brain studies from the chemical weapons, killing troops en masse.
[02:16:30.417 --> 02:16:33.839]  When you talk about a million casualties, break that down for us.
[02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:43.545]  Well, when we look at a million casualties, what we are seeing, that's, right now, for example, CBS News 60 Minutes did a story on this on January 3rd.
[02:16:44.346 --> 02:16:45.827]  And they, you know, they broadcast it.
[02:16:45.847 --> 02:16:51.811]  And Paul, God bless Paul Sullivan from Vets for Common Concern, you know, Common Sense, he was the one that pushed that through.
[02:16:52.409 --> 02:17:00.971]  But what CBS News 60 Minutes confirmed on January 3rd in their story was, delay, deny, and wait till I die.
[02:17:01.351 --> 02:17:21.856]  In other words, what we will do, the military, the Department of Defense, and the VA will do, will deny any correlation between all the adverse health and environmental effects from all these toxic exposures, specifically uranium munitions, deny medical care for it, delay any treatment that you do get if you are lucky to get it, and just wait till you die.
[02:17:22.549 --> 02:17:29.714]  And the number of family members, and everybody else, and the soldiers involved, and everybody, they never stop calling for help.
[02:17:29.954 --> 02:17:31.155]  It's every day.
[02:17:31.255 --> 02:17:49.287]  And the deformities of the troops, their children, the deformities of the Iraqis, the Serbs, the Afghans, and I know you've got the numbers on this, but is it not an exponential increase year to year in the amount of DU being served out by armories?
[02:17:49.918 --> 02:17:50.819]  Incredible amount.
[02:17:50.839 --> 02:17:56.622]  I mean, the United States gives this stuff away to anybody and everybody that will take it, and then we use it against all known targets.
[02:17:57.362 --> 02:18:03.025]  I mean, during Desert Storm, we use it against the armor, effectively, all the tanks and the, you know, trucks and everything else.
[02:18:03.546 --> 02:18:06.067]  But we also shot up the bunkers and everything else.
[02:18:06.667 --> 02:18:11.650]  And then with Operation... when we went into the Balkans in 1994, we shot up buildings and everything.
[02:18:12.551 --> 02:18:16.473]  Again, in the Balkans in 1991, this is... and you go to the old Yugoslavia,
[02:18:17.179 --> 02:18:21.042]  And Pekka Abiso, who was head of the United Nations, he actually told the U.S.
[02:18:21.062 --> 02:18:24.104]  Department of Defense to clean up all of these facilities they shot up.
[02:18:24.885 --> 02:18:28.947]  And then we continued Operation Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[02:18:29.668 --> 02:18:46.540]  We have literally, with uranium munitions, and I've got total video, total reports, we've got all of this stuff, no questions photographed, shot up apartment buildings, hospitals, water treatment facilities, sewage sanitation plants, plus all the, you know, cars and trucks you could ever imagine.
[02:18:47.142 --> 02:18:49.504]  And this stuff is so extraordinarily effective.
[02:18:49.964 --> 02:18:59.311]  They talked about it originally when it was used for armor, but it's far more effective against a conventional house or an apartment building or a water facility than it is against a tank.
[02:18:59.511 --> 02:19:01.492]  Because there ain't any tanks left to shoot!
[02:19:04.914 --> 02:19:08.357]  And then our troops move into the areas they've blown to bits.
[02:19:09.002 --> 02:19:09.502]  That's correct.
[02:19:09.562 --> 02:19:16.187]  Our troops move in and then they're not even provided the mandatory respiratory and skin protection that is required by the U.S.
[02:19:16.247 --> 02:19:18.129]  Army Regulation and the U.S.
[02:19:18.189 --> 02:19:20.591]  Technical Bulletin provides all the specifications.
[02:19:21.091 --> 02:19:31.439]  But more important, the fact that our Department of Defense, the British Ministry of Defense, the Canadians and the Australians and the Israelis, I mean, you have to understand, those are the five countries that use it.
[02:19:32.239 --> 02:19:36.423]  They use it without hesitation, completely and totally disregard
[02:19:39.347 --> 02:19:40.308]  Stay there, Dr. Rocky.
[02:19:40.368 --> 02:19:44.351]  I mean, basically, you might as well, after our troops have had a war, line them all up and shoot them.
[02:19:44.711 --> 02:19:45.912]  And that's the equivalent of this.
[02:19:46.512 --> 02:19:51.196]  But when they come home and die, all the people singing God Bless America, they don't want to talk to them.
[02:19:51.216 --> 02:19:53.198]  Just get in the coffin, shut up and die.
[02:19:53.772 --> 02:19:56.953]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:19:57.333 --> 02:19:59.154]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:19:59.614 --> 02:20:00.034]  Don't!
[02:20:00.494 --> 02:20:03.515]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:20:03.916 --> 02:20:11.058]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[02:20:11.038 --> 02:20:12.699]  's number one debt secret.
[02:20:13.019 --> 02:20:16.680]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[02:20:17.080 --> 02:20:19.821]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[02:20:20.221 --> 02:20:27.242]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[02:20:27.582 --> 02:20:28.602]  Herb K was right.
[02:20:28.762 --> 02:20:31.823]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:20:31.943 --> 02:20:32.963]  What have you got to lose?
[02:20:33.303 --> 02:20:36.503]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[02:20:37.024 --> 02:20:40.704]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[02:20:40.964 --> 02:20:41.244]  Call 888-352-7726.
[02:20:45.405 --> 02:20:45.805]  That's 888-352-7726.
[02:20:45.826 --> 02:20:45.866]  888-352-7726.
[02:20:45.886 --> 02:20:48.728]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:20:48.748 --> 02:20:51.290]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:20:51.310 --> 02:20:55.213]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:21:04.341 --> 02:21:07.002]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:21:07.022 --> 02:21:13.243]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:21:13.423 --> 02:21:18.444]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:21:18.604 --> 02:21:28.586]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:21:28.706 --> 02:21:30.807]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:21:31.048 --> 02:21:32.368]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:32.649 --> 02:21:34.910]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:35.110 --> 02:21:36.932]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:21:37.232 --> 02:21:42.035]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:21:42.375 --> 02:21:47.158]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[02:21:54.480 --> 02:21:56.622]  Peter Kratschnabel here from Midas Resources.
[02:21:56.922 --> 02:21:59.364]  Are you concerned about uncontrollable government spending?
[02:21:59.944 --> 02:22:01.826]  A banking system on the verge of collapse?
[02:22:02.406 --> 02:22:04.288]  Banks on the edge of being nationalized?
[02:22:04.848 --> 02:22:06.730]  Wall Street and continuous free fall?
[02:22:07.330 --> 02:22:09.652]  Scandal after scandal with hedge fund companies?
[02:22:10.193 --> 02:22:15.056]  If protecting your hard-earned savings or retirement fund is on your mind, the answer is simple.
[02:22:15.577 --> 02:22:18.079]  Secure your assets by purchasing gold and silver.
[02:22:18.639 --> 02:22:26.850]  Since President Nixon took us off the gold standard in 1971, the United States has been operating the longest running fiat currency in the history of mankind.
[02:22:27.552 --> 02:22:30.635]  Gold has held its purchasing power for over 6,000 years.
[02:22:31.135 --> 02:22:34.098]  Contact me, Peter Kronschnabel, at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:22:34.138 --> 02:22:36.980]  Once again, that's Peter at 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:22:37.040 --> 02:22:39.923]  While you can still purchase gold with paper, that is 1-800-686-2237, extension 108.
[02:22:53.607 --> 02:22:55.989]  Men, are you thinking about the health of your prostate?
[02:22:56.209 --> 02:23:01.735]  Recently, New Vitality Health Products gave away thousands of free bottles of the supplement Beta Prostate.

[02:23:14.306 --> 02:23:17.529]  Sleeping habits, intimacy, and overall quality of life.
[02:23:17.750 --> 02:23:26.198]  Beta Prostate is so powerful, you'd have to take 100 sawpaw metal capsules in order to get the same natural plant sterols as one Beta Prostate.

[02:23:44.250 --> 02:23:44.310]  1-800-360-8306.
[02:23:55.407 --> 02:23:59.529]  We're not going to open the phones up for Dr. Doug Rocky.
[02:23:59.569 --> 02:24:05.071]  The best way for you to send your questions is twitter.com forward slash the real Alex Jones.
[02:24:06.611 --> 02:24:07.551]  That's our Twitter account.
[02:24:07.572 --> 02:24:11.153]  There's a lot of other great Alex Jones fan sites, but that's our official Twitter account also.
[02:24:12.421 --> 02:24:14.603]  Yeah, real Alex Jones, not the real Alex Jones.
[02:24:14.623 --> 02:24:16.844]  So twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones.
[02:24:17.785 --> 02:24:23.789]  Going back to Dr. Doug Rockey, one of the top experts in the world on DU, even according to the Pentagon, who he worked for.
[02:24:25.110 --> 02:24:32.336]  Dr. Rockey, let's talk about the real health effects of the studies and what they've known DU does, and how it's a toxic byproduct of spent
[02:24:32.796 --> 02:24:34.337]  Fuel rods from nuclear reactors.
[02:24:34.977 --> 02:24:38.860]  But more importantly, I want to ask you now about the mindset of the elite.
[02:24:38.880 --> 02:24:48.326]  I mean, they had DU in the 40s and 50s, and I saw papers where they talked about it as a weapon, and they said, we can't use it because it kills our own personnel and people that move into the areas.
[02:24:48.707 --> 02:24:57.673]  What changed in the mindset where they wouldn't use it in the 50s, 60s, and 70s, and now it's just, we're going to use it at local shooting ranges for the military.
[02:24:57.913 --> 02:24:59.234]  We're going to use it in Hawaii.
[02:24:59.454 --> 02:25:00.815]  We're going to use it in Puerto Rico.
[02:25:01.155 --> 02:25:03.916]  We're gonna tell the troops it's okay and watch them die!
[02:25:03.956 --> 02:25:05.836]  I mean, this is psychopathic murder!
[02:25:06.596 --> 02:25:07.117]  Yes, it is.
[02:25:07.197 --> 02:25:11.638]  It's just the fact that they made the decision that human life had no value.
[02:25:12.098 --> 02:25:13.518]  That animals had no value.
[02:25:13.558 --> 02:25:14.798]  That food has no value.
[02:25:15.379 --> 02:25:20.460]  And they just made a conscious decision, and I've been fighting this since I did all the research for them.
[02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:22.540]  The Nevada Test Site wrote the directives.
[02:25:23.281 --> 02:25:24.481]  They just don't care.
[02:25:25.001 --> 02:25:28.822]  But, as you said, the health and environmental effects of all this have always been known.
[02:25:29.483 --> 02:25:33.985]  I mean, my own medical care for my depleted uranium exposures because of my assigned duties.
[02:25:34.085 --> 02:25:43.128]  One of the things I forced it with was the original 1973 report on the use of uranium munitions by Israelis against the Egyptians in the Sinai.
[02:25:43.868 --> 02:25:47.650]  And all of that stuff was known then, it was documented there in the official reports.
[02:25:47.690 --> 02:25:49.090]  Again, these are not classified.
[02:25:49.811 --> 02:25:52.092]  But they're just totally there and they're totally ignored.
[02:25:52.632 --> 02:25:55.413]  Prior to Operation Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom,
[02:25:56.434 --> 02:25:59.797]  Colonel J. Edgar Wakayama, who's the Director of the U.S.
[02:25:59.817 --> 02:26:15.009]  Department of Defense Operational Test and Evaluation Command, gave a briefing to all the senior generals and everybody in the Pentagon upon depleted uranium, how it works, what it is, the fact that the munitions, as you said, go all the way down to the M-16 rifle, .50 cal, everything all the way up.
[02:26:15.790 --> 02:26:25.918]  But in this briefing, he stated very specifically, I'm going to quote very, very specifically, depleted uranium munitions, when used,
[02:26:27.981 --> 02:26:28.421]  Okay.
[02:26:29.621 --> 02:26:32.082]  They emit alpha, beta, and gamma particles in X-rays.
[02:26:33.362 --> 02:26:38.963]  The alpha particle taken inside the body in large doses is hazardous to cell damage and cancer.
[02:26:40.523 --> 02:26:42.644]  Quote, lung cancer is well documented.
[02:26:43.744 --> 02:26:44.644]  We continue on.
[02:26:44.704 --> 02:26:47.265]  Beta particle is hazardous to the skin and the length of the eye.
[02:26:47.285 --> 02:26:54.086]  Now personally, I've learned that because of all my radiation cataracts and the other problems with the eyes and everybody else is reporting it.
[02:26:55.071 --> 02:27:02.733]  It continues on, very, very, quote, I mean, very, very direct, and it says, DU is chemically toxic.
[02:27:04.173 --> 02:27:11.515]  We look at all this stuff, we have total confirmation, quote, urine samples containing uranium are mutagenic as determined by the Ames test.
[02:27:12.375 --> 02:27:18.036]  The cultured human stem bone cell line with DU also transforms the cells that become carcinogenic.
[02:27:18.516 --> 02:27:23.037]  That's the reason why we're seeing so incredible levels, I mean, incredible levels of leukemia.
[02:27:23.982 --> 02:27:32.708]  And all these young kids coming back from Desert Storm, but we're also seeing leukemia in the children, the offspring of those who were exposed during Desert Storm.
[02:27:32.728 --> 02:27:38.992]  Because just like fluoride, the particle's so small, doctor, correct me if I'm wrong, it precipitates into the bone.
[02:27:39.473 --> 02:27:40.553]  That's correct.
[02:27:40.593 --> 02:27:43.555]  There is no respiratory skin protection that'll work.
[02:27:44.216 --> 02:27:53.122]  Even though when we did all this work for the military, the Department of Energy gave us their best respirators, the Army gave us their best respirators, it went through it like an open barn door.
[02:27:53.974 --> 02:27:55.255]  It absolutely does it.
[02:27:55.615 --> 02:28:01.540]  One of the big problems, quote from the Wakayama briefing, I'm going to read this because it's astonishing, they know and they disregard it.
[02:28:02.060 --> 02:28:04.803]  The three major routes of human exposure to D.U.
[02:28:05.003 --> 02:28:18.874]  are wounding by shrapnel, inhalation, lungs and thoracic, lymph nodes, ingestions, most among children playing and eating contaminated soil and contaminated drink of water and food in the community, end quote.
[02:28:19.754 --> 02:28:21.596]  That is what we're seeing throughout Iraq.
[02:28:21.616 --> 02:28:22.657]  And that's from what year?
[02:28:23.459 --> 02:28:23.819]  Pardon me?
[02:28:24.540 --> 02:28:25.541]  What year was that report?
[02:28:25.861 --> 02:28:32.106]  This is a briefing to the senior Pentagon leadership in 2002, before the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom.
[02:28:32.186 --> 02:28:47.799]  And again, I'm going from memory interviewing you and others and reading mainstream news, but I saw reports in the fifties, it was a secret weapon they were only going to use if the Russians flooded into Eastern Europe, but they said we still don't advise because it ruins the area for billions of years.
[02:28:48.319 --> 02:28:49.840]  I mean, they know this.
[02:28:50.401 --> 02:28:52.583]  It's just so incredible, and they know
[02:28:53.183 --> 02:29:01.025]  I mean, I see the numbers of troops coming back and dropping dead and getting cancer and getting leukemia and other blood cancers, and they know it's killing them.
[02:29:01.065 --> 02:29:09.227]  I mean, this is... We ought to make all these generals go into the Proving Grounds and snort a line of DU if it's so good.
[02:29:09.688 --> 02:29:22.191]  When I specifically talk to the generals of Washington, D.C., as I've done in the last few weeks, and ask them very specifically for help in getting medical care and environmental remediation, they just say, go to your Congressman or Senator, we're not going to help you.
[02:29:24.929 --> 02:29:31.634]  And I noticed those troops, troops have told me and I've seen the news, the generals won't stay in these bombed out buildings like they tell the troops to.
[02:29:32.054 --> 02:29:34.696]  And notice none of these generals want to stay in Iraq very long.
[02:29:34.976 --> 02:29:36.697]  Dr. Rockey, long segment coming up.
[02:29:36.797 --> 02:29:38.378]  Roll through the documents for people.
[02:29:38.659 --> 02:29:43.422]  Because all you folks out there that claim you love the troops so much and stick American flags on your car.
[02:29:43.982 --> 02:29:44.923]  We're on the march.
[02:29:45.383 --> 02:29:47.004]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:47.925 --> 02:29:50.587]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:54.127 --> 02:29:56.728]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:29:57.128 --> 02:30:02.089]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:30:02.449 --> 02:30:04.189]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:30:04.509 --> 02:30:09.310]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:30:09.490 --> 02:30:10.451]  How much do you want?
[02:30:10.691 --> 02:30:11.431]  When do you want it?
[02:30:11.811 --> 02:30:13.391]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:30:13.691 --> 02:30:14.512]  When will you need it?
[02:30:14.752 --> 02:30:16.832]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:30:16.972 --> 02:30:18.072]  Will there be any food?
[02:30:18.312 --> 02:30:19.633]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:30:19.833 --> 02:30:20.853]  If there's a quarantine,
[02:30:21.053 --> 02:30:22.216]  And you can't feed yourself.
[02:30:22.377 --> 02:30:24.904]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:30:25.104 --> 02:30:28.293]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:30:28.694 --> 02:30:29.917]  Food is your ammunition.
