[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:09.215]  ...to the IAEA rules, and so hoax after hoax by the same globalists that have brought us WMDs in Iraq.
[00:00:09.695 --> 00:00:12.677]  Yeah, Alex, we have to be just trifle careful here.
[00:00:13.738 --> 00:00:20.983]  I think, talked to a lot of the experts here, Iran should have notified us before they did about that thing.
[00:00:21.103 --> 00:00:26.867]  When they did invite us in, of course, the UN inspectors found nothing, so we're still at a very rudimentary stage.
[00:00:27.472 --> 00:00:34.114]  But one has to remember that there are certain obligations the Iranians have not lived up to.
[00:00:34.794 --> 00:00:41.136]  And people have said to me, did Iran ever try to do a nuclear weapon?
[00:00:41.536 --> 00:00:42.417]  Well, hell yes.
[00:00:42.437 --> 00:00:45.538]  Let's realize that up until the fall of 2003, they spent almost two decades working
[00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:53.310]  Well, Ray, I'm certainly no fan of Iran.
[00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.671]  I'm not a fan of any of these governments around the world.
[00:00:55.691 --> 00:01:01.153]  They're almost always run by corrupt oligarchies or these different regimes.
[00:01:01.673 --> 00:01:06.955]  My issue is I don't want World War III to start there in the Middle East and Central Asia.
[00:01:07.375 --> 00:01:11.377]  And we really appreciate you coming on and breaking down all these different angles today.
[00:01:11.737 --> 00:01:15.498]  And we certainly hope that war isn't launched in the spring or the summer.
[00:01:15.538 --> 00:01:16.519]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:17.159]  Thanks for the time.
[00:01:18.482 --> 00:01:19.664]  Alright, there goes Ray McGovern.
[00:01:20.104 --> 00:01:21.947]  Now, for the balance of the shower...
[00:01:25.623 --> 00:01:34.208]  For the balance of this hour, we are joined by Mike Rivera of WhatReallyHappened.com, fellow GCN radio host.
[00:01:34.228 --> 00:01:36.109]  He joins us once a month here.
[00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:38.350]  Of course, I'm Alex Jones of Infowars.com.
[00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.914]  We just began simulcasting the last two hours and 45 minutes of this radio show.
[00:01:43.954 --> 00:01:49.817]  We always take a portion of the show and transmit it visually for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:01:49.857 --> 00:01:52.659]  I want to shift gears into the economy.
[00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:00.661]  I want to get into the burgeoning police state, the attack on the internet, and a host of other issues with Mike Rivero.
[00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:09.544]  But in the balance of this short segment, as we were just talking about, Senator Kerry going over to Israel this week saying, please don't launch an attack on Iran.
[00:02:10.204 --> 00:02:13.945]  We have the military saying they don't want to do it, but most of the newspapers pushing it.
[00:02:15.605 --> 00:02:19.947]  I do want to get Mike Rivero's take on what's happening in the Middle East right now.
[00:02:20.047 --> 00:02:21.247]  Mike Rivero, thanks for joining us.
[00:02:22.052 --> 00:02:23.373]  Thank you for having me there, Alex.
[00:02:23.633 --> 00:02:33.896]  And my take on the Middle East is, as you point out, we have a group of individuals in the United States and in Israel who want yet another war on Israel's enemies.
[00:02:34.236 --> 00:02:35.957]  They're still pushing as hard as they can.
[00:02:36.317 --> 00:02:44.880]  About two weeks ago, leading up to the Olympics, there was this huge, renewed propaganda effort to try and convince America that Iran is some kind of a threat to us.
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.701]  They didn't get any traction with that, and they've kind of backed off.
[00:02:48.141 --> 00:02:53.045]  Then we were hearing about how Israel might just go ahead and attack Iran without the permission of the United States.
[00:02:53.666 --> 00:02:56.948]  They were supposed to vote on that in the Knesset on Sunday.
[00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:58.590]  I don't think they got the vote.
[00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.952]  They're not acting like they got it.
[00:03:01.212 --> 00:03:08.598]  Now, yes, last night we got this statement from Hillary Clinton that renewed new sanctions against Iran may take a couple of months.
[00:03:08.758 --> 00:03:09.339]  And so I think
[00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:18.145]  The news story we were seeing about how Russia was now open to sanctions was not 100% accurate because what Russia really said is what they've always said.
[00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:24.970]  If there was evidence of a nuclear weapon program in Iran, they would support more sanctions.
[00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.612]  But they're not willing to just support them as things are right now.
[00:03:29.133 --> 00:03:36.278]  What about Iranian statements that we've been seeing from Ahmadinejad and others that they expect Israel to attack them in the spring or summer?
[00:03:37.944 --> 00:03:40.126]  It seems a very reasonable expectation.
[00:03:40.287 --> 00:03:54.585]  I think the only reason Israel hasn't attacked yet is because the American government cannot get the support of the American people for another war and cannot get the support of the American people for any more assistance and aid in Israel's wars against other countries.
[00:03:54.985 --> 00:03:55.326]  I think
[00:03:56.106 --> 00:04:02.432]  Operation Cast Lead in Gaza may prove in hindsight to have been Israel's greatest political miscalculation.
[00:04:02.693 --> 00:04:07.117]  They're trying to basically rebrand and spin it away as no big deal.
[00:04:07.377 --> 00:04:11.361]  But I think the world got a real wake-up call about what Israel is really like.
[00:04:11.721 --> 00:04:16.566]  And the American people, by and large, do not want to support that, either morally or financially.
[00:04:16.946 --> 00:04:20.110]  And because of that, I think that's putting a brake on the situation.
[00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:25.936]  Now, of course, our future is always under the control of whichever world leader is the least mentally stable.
[00:04:26.276 --> 00:04:33.884]  And there are definitely people in Israel who are capable of ordering an attack against Iran, knowing that Israel could not withstand a counterattack,
[00:04:34.264 --> 00:04:38.327]  But just absolutely, serenely confident that they can get the U.S.
[00:04:38.347 --> 00:04:43.332]  to come in, spend American dollars, shed American lives to protect Israel from retaliation.
[00:04:43.352 --> 00:04:45.133]  And then don't let a good crisis go to waste.
[00:04:45.153 --> 00:04:46.314]  Get us into a crisis.
[00:04:46.694 --> 00:04:49.537]  We're going to come back and finish up on this topic because
[00:04:51.121 --> 00:04:57.383]  We know Israel, at least large sectors of their government, as you just said, the Knesset isn't really going for it right now, so that's some good news.
[00:04:57.943 --> 00:05:02.404]  But large sectors of the Israeli government, including their leader, Netanyahu, do want it right now.
[00:05:03.264 --> 00:05:12.367]  And they have some allies, the military-industrial complex and the big banks, that want a new political distraction to bring in this new bank of the world that's being pushed.
[00:05:12.387 --> 00:05:13.127]  We'll talk about that.
[00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:18.223]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:06:13.528 --> 00:06:18.792]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[00:06:18.872 --> 00:06:21.574]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:06:21.614 --> 00:06:25.998]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:06:26.986 --> 00:06:31.449]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.

[00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:15.330]  Hi, this is Peter Krashnobyl with Midas Resources.
[00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:20.172]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high, and inflation will be a direct result of the spending policy.
[00:07:20.272 --> 00:07:26.735]  The multiple federal stimulus packages have been an utter failure, unless you're an executive for AIG, a large banking or investment institution.
[00:07:26.876 --> 00:07:29.317]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[00:07:29.377 --> 00:07:31.878]  People like you and I can't go to Washington for a bailout.
[00:07:31.978 --> 00:07:36.920]  Having your hard-earned money in the stock market or any other related paper asset is a lose-lose proposition.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.461]  Lose on your capital investment,
[00:07:38.641 --> 00:07:41.824]  And when you cash out, you're paid in the dollar that is losing value every day.
[00:07:42.004 --> 00:07:48.189]  One thing is certain, having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens, your investment will never be worthless.
[00:07:48.349 --> 00:07:52.212]  If you've been thinking about investing in physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[00:07:52.432 --> 00:07:56.816]  Call me today, Peter Krashenable at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:07:56.916 --> 00:08:02.000]  And I'll take the time to personally put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:02.460]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:08:05.623 --> 00:08:07.889]  You've worked hard your whole life, and I want to work hard for you.
[00:08:08.069 --> 00:08:09.433]  Call Peter Krashnabel, 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[00:08:13.365 --> 00:08:13.705]  Hello.
[00:08:14.025 --> 00:08:18.448]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[00:08:18.788 --> 00:08:23.270]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:28.413]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[00:08:28.613 --> 00:08:33.476]  I have about 15 wild food guides on my bookshelf, which left me wondering if I even needed another book.
[00:08:33.776 --> 00:08:34.736]  Boy, was I wrong.
[00:08:35.036 --> 00:08:37.958]  My knowledge exploded to an entire universe of wild foods.
[00:08:38.178 --> 00:08:42.003]  In olden days, it was the norm to know which plants are edible and which are not.
[00:08:42.043 --> 00:08:45.007]  Dear Linda, just wanted to let you know I received your book today.
[00:08:45.267 --> 00:08:45.648]  Wow!
[00:08:45.788 --> 00:08:47.049]  I watched the DVD last night.
[00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:48.411]  I was all struck.
[00:08:48.551 --> 00:08:50.053]  What wonderful work you have done.
[00:08:50.233 --> 00:08:52.436]  This information can bless many people.
[00:08:52.456 --> 00:08:53.097]  Thank you.
[00:08:53.117 --> 00:08:53.817]  Thank you again.
[00:08:53.978 --> 00:08:54.518]  Thanks again.
[00:08:54.718 --> 00:08:57.620]  Your book has given me the most hope and inspiration.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.240]  Thank you.
[00:08:58.441 --> 00:09:01.443]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[00:09:01.863 --> 00:09:05.205]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[00:09:05.445 --> 00:09:09.448]  You can order online for you and your loved ones or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[00:09:24.785 --> 00:09:26.207]  Is it getting better?
[00:09:29.631 --> 00:09:31.313]  Or do you feel the same?
[00:09:31.393 --> 00:09:32.995]  Bottom line ladies and gentlemen
[00:09:34.554 --> 00:09:41.499]  The United States has become an engine of oppression and preemptive war and wars of aggression.
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:53.208]  We're being robbed by the same offshore banks that own the big military industrial complex that are making hundreds of billions a year off the surveillance grid being installed all over the world, but predominantly in England, the U.S.
[00:09:53.268 --> 00:09:55.070]  and Canada, Australia, New Zealand.
[00:09:56.271 --> 00:09:57.572]  And they want new wars.
[00:09:58.432 --> 00:10:01.095]  And they are waging war against our liberties and freedoms.
[00:10:02.296 --> 00:10:07.102]  And I was talking to Mike Rivero about the fact that Israel says they want to go to war with Iran.
[00:10:07.563 --> 00:10:21.560]  They have some allies, though, don't they, Mike, in that the corrupt corporations need this political distraction and they need, because they know if we're in a war, people will put up with losing their jobs or having their pension funds seized.
[00:10:22.521 --> 00:10:28.405]  They hope that people will put up with losing their jobs and having their pension funds seized.
[00:10:28.645 --> 00:10:40.772]  This kind of wars distraction has worked before, but this is a very new age and we're going into this potential escalation of conflict with the American people already polling as two-thirds are already angry with the federal government.
[00:10:41.093 --> 00:10:42.193]  They don't trust the government.
[00:10:42.213 --> 00:10:43.254]  They don't trust the banks.
[00:10:43.494 --> 00:10:46.236]  They understand that wars are just a big money-making deal.
[00:10:46.936 --> 00:10:48.638]  You know, the banks want wars.
[00:10:48.678 --> 00:10:52.561]  They don't even care which side wins or loses because both sides go into debt.
[00:10:53.081 --> 00:10:55.483]  And the American people certainly understand this.
[00:10:55.803 --> 00:11:03.609]  And so I think the reaction of the American public to a new war is going to be dramatically different from what the government and the corporations and the banks hope it will be.
[00:11:03.869 --> 00:11:06.191]  We understand about the military-industrial complex.
[00:11:06.491 --> 00:11:10.214]  We understand that Iran is not actually a threat to the United States of America.
[00:11:10.514 --> 00:11:13.957]  We understand that we were lied into the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[00:11:14.677 --> 00:11:18.440]  And that we're engaging in these covert wars in Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen.
[00:11:18.661 --> 00:11:21.543]  We're killing more civilians than we are enemy combatants.
[00:11:21.863 --> 00:11:23.905]  And the American people, I think, are really kind of fed up.
[00:11:24.165 --> 00:11:27.528]  I think a new war in Iran is going to blow up in the government's face.
[00:11:27.788 --> 00:11:29.530]  I think that's the reason it hasn't started yet.
[00:11:31.496 --> 00:11:45.699]  The only way Iran is a threat, and this is just for my own common sense, but I've seen a lot of top analysts say the same thing, is if you do attack them, according to the law of war, if you're preemptively attacked, you can fight back any way you want.
[00:11:45.759 --> 00:11:46.719]  Like, U.S.
[00:11:46.739 --> 00:11:54.541]  militaries always put special forces in behind enemy lines to blow up dams, to attack police stations, to engage in terror attacks.
[00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:57.882]  That's just called guerrilla warfare.
[00:11:58.422 --> 00:12:05.066]  But then the media has said, if Iran so much as fires anti-aircraft guns at Israeli or U.S.
[00:12:05.146 --> 00:12:08.187]  jets while they're bombing them, that that's an act of terror.
[00:12:08.207 --> 00:12:20.934]  I mean, this is mass mental illness, where anyone who buys into this is basically the equivalent of saying anyone who raised a hand against Hitler was bad, or anyone who raised a hand against Stalin was bad.
[00:12:21.474 --> 00:12:25.096]  That you don't have a right to raise your hand against an aggressor.
[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.842]  Yeah, it's basically it's the how dare you fight back at us kind of situation.
[00:12:30.763 --> 00:12:34.905]  Or as Eddie Izzard would say, you know, are they allowed to do that kind of mentality?
[00:12:35.306 --> 00:12:35.906]  And it is.
[00:12:36.046 --> 00:12:38.668]  I mean, you know, we're waging war on all these countries.
[00:12:39.108 --> 00:12:43.811]  And I think this is an extension of this whole idea that we're somehow doing these nations a favor.
[00:12:43.851 --> 00:12:45.072]  We saw that with the run up to Iraq.
[00:12:46.132 --> 00:12:50.735]  They're going to greet us with flowers and therefore anybody who's shooting back at us is just being a spoilsport.
[00:12:51.075 --> 00:12:52.596]  The same thing going into Iran.
[00:12:52.796 --> 00:12:54.537]  We're just bringing those people democracy.
[00:12:54.557 --> 00:12:55.698]  Of course they're going to welcome us.
[00:12:55.918 --> 00:12:58.539]  And the only people shooting back at us are a bunch of malcontents.
[00:12:58.939 --> 00:13:00.540]  And it's completely absurd.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:09.265]  The people that are shooting back at the American forces are the ordinary, everyday men, women, and children who live in a country and they want to hang on to it.
[00:13:09.325 --> 00:13:12.227]  They don't want to see it taken over by another U.S.
[00:13:12.267 --> 00:13:12.547]  puppet.
[00:13:12.967 --> 00:13:23.912]  We know why FEMA in all their manuals demonizes the Founding Fathers and calls them terrorists because the British were invading and they were fighting back against the imperial power and that is terrorism.
[00:13:24.712 --> 00:13:38.919]  And if you read the internal Pentagon documents, the banks in Serbia and Iraq and other places, they want to wreck the infrastructure so the big banks can come in with loans at 30% interest, with our tax money paying for it, and take over their countries.
[00:13:39.659 --> 00:13:41.160]  They know there's not going to be roses.
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.521]  They know they're not liberating.
[00:13:42.982 --> 00:13:56.953]  We know in every case where the West has its druthers, it installs dictators or oligarchs over these countries and actually puts Muslim extremists back in power in Afghanistan and into power in Iraq because they like them!
[00:13:58.382 --> 00:14:03.304]  They just want to keep the turmoil going because the turmoil creates business opportunities for American interest.
[00:14:03.584 --> 00:14:07.986]  This is a war to impose American Western banks on the rest of the world.
[00:14:08.006 --> 00:14:13.768]  When you hear the buzz phrase, clash of civilizations, it's literally a war between two banking systems.
[00:14:14.088 --> 00:14:18.713]  You have the Islamic banking system on one, and you have the Western-style banking system on the other.
[00:14:18.974 --> 00:14:29.786]  The Reserve Banking System, and as I've pointed out many, many times before, the problem with the Federal Reserve Banking System is because all the money represents a loan from the private central bank to the people.
[00:14:30.226 --> 00:14:38.455]  The instant that first Federal Reserve note goes into circulation, more money is owed to the banking system than is actually in existence.
[00:14:38.675 --> 00:14:46.363]  And this is why we have recession after recession after depression after depression, and now they want to impose the same thing on the rest of the world.
[00:14:46.883 --> 00:14:57.167]  We'll talk about the global dictatorship of the Bank Straight Ahead, a financial black hole designed from its inception to fully dominate and create neo-feudalism.
[00:14:57.487 --> 00:15:01.729]  They then come in with the phony environmentalism to camouflage open slavery.
[00:15:03.989 --> 00:15:04.910]  We're on the march.
[00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:06.990]  The empire's on the run.
[00:15:07.911 --> 00:15:10.612]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:15:14.841 --> 00:15:18.462]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:15:18.802 --> 00:15:26.924]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:15:27.665 --> 00:15:31.706]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:15:32.286 --> 00:15:43.109]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:52.751]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:15:53.251 --> 00:15:58.292]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:15:58.693 --> 00:16:05.874]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:08.915]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:16:12.776 --> 00:16:17.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:17.941]  Number one.
[00:16:18.241 --> 00:16:21.404]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:16:21.664 --> 00:16:22.225]  Number two.
[00:16:22.525 --> 00:16:27.069]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:16:27.409 --> 00:16:27.870]  It's true.
[00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:32.734]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:33.555]  Number three.
[00:16:33.835 --> 00:16:37.118]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:16:37.418 --> 00:16:41.161]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:16:42.142 --> 00:16:44.504]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:16:44.905 --> 00:16:48.307]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:16:49.368 --> 00:16:53.292]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:58.276]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:17:09.381 --> 00:17:16.524]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:17:16.584 --> 00:17:19.365]  That produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:17:19.506 --> 00:17:20.746]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:17:20.786 --> 00:17:21.466]  It's very real.
[00:17:21.607 --> 00:17:23.708]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.

[00:19:08.121 --> 00:19:10.022]  I've been quietly working on for close to a year.
[00:19:10.902 --> 00:19:13.123]  I get so busy on these films we don't even plug we're making them.
[00:19:13.844 --> 00:19:18.887]  We've also got Jason Bermas' new film, Invisible Empire, which is a whole new level for Jason.
[00:19:18.907 --> 00:19:20.988]  It's an incredibly powerful film.
[00:19:21.008 --> 00:19:22.449]  The whole history of the New World Order.
[00:19:22.869 --> 00:19:25.671]  Extremely informative and riveting documentary.
[00:19:25.691 --> 00:19:29.113]  That will all premiere at PrisonPlanet.tv next month.

[00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:22.692]  No, this isn't something out of a science fiction book.
[00:20:23.092 --> 00:20:25.213]  Our sponsor, Acolabloo, with their Acolabloo 28,
[00:20:26.514 --> 00:20:28.355]  And they're brand new Acola Blue 30 machines.

[00:20:56.195 --> 00:20:59.998]  Okay, going back to Mike Rivero, again, who joins us from Hawaii via video Skype for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, radio, you're hearing him.
[00:21:00.018 --> 00:21:00.478]  The economy, how long
[00:21:19.625 --> 00:21:20.906]  I guess the answer is they can't.
[00:21:21.026 --> 00:21:40.775]  I mean, they aren't fooling people, but how long can they fool the rest of the dumbbells out there that we're not really in a depression, that the banks, Gordon Brown and others, announcing a constitution of and by the banks globally, bankrupting all the nations by design, not just Iceland, not just Spain, not just Greece, but the U.S.
[00:21:41.195 --> 00:21:48.719]  They're now openly in our media, Bloomberg Financial everywhere, parroting, the banks will save us later this year, early next year, the next 16 months.
[00:21:49.099 --> 00:21:50.200]  The banks will save you.
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:22:04.107]  They're going to bankrupt everything and then you will pay your taxes to them and we've got to raise taxes to pay the banks and cut Medicare and Medicaid and we've got to do this or we're going to have a depression when we're already going into a depression because they've done it by design.
[00:22:04.408 --> 00:22:08.770]  Mike Rivero, how do you see this unfolding and how bad from your research is the economy really?
[00:22:09.485 --> 00:22:12.467]  Well, the economy is, I think, in a hopeless situation.
[00:22:12.547 --> 00:22:15.689]  I mean, the government has plunged us all deeply into debt.
[00:22:16.329 --> 00:22:18.851]  They impoverished us even further to save Wall Street.
[00:22:19.151 --> 00:22:22.453]  Meanwhile, they were sending all of our manufacturing jobs to other countries.
[00:22:23.293 --> 00:22:29.377]  I equate our economy to a boat with ten holes in the bottom and the government only has five corks.
[00:22:29.777 --> 00:22:37.181]  And all it's able to do right now is grab a cork out of one hole and shove it into another in full view of the press cameras and say, look, I'm correcting the problem.
[00:22:37.221 --> 00:22:38.102]  I'm fixing the problem.
[00:22:38.442 --> 00:22:42.784]  But we know the long term, I don't think it's possible to save this country right now.
[00:22:42.924 --> 00:22:44.585]  I don't think it's possible to save the economy.
[00:22:45.025 --> 00:22:56.151]  And you know, you and I have talked about the push for a global government, and we know that the three avenues, the three venues that they've been pushing forward are, one is human-caused global warming, which is crumbling.
[00:22:56.771 --> 00:22:59.013]  The second one was the global pandemic.
[00:22:59.054 --> 00:23:00.034]  That's not working out.
[00:23:00.295 --> 00:23:12.907]  But the one that they're still very much on track with is the global economic meltdown, where they're going to destroy the economies of all these various nations and then say, look, we've got a brand new World Bank that is going to make everything all better.
[00:23:13.007 --> 00:23:14.448]  And of course, that's nonsense.
[00:23:14.768 --> 00:23:19.593]  Insanity is defined as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome.
[00:23:19.893 --> 00:23:27.656]  We have a reserve banking system in place in the United States of America that has brought us nothing but pain, misery, recession, depression.
[00:23:27.956 --> 00:23:38.081]  The real wealth of the nation has been sucked out of the hands of the people and put in the pockets of the private bankers, and now they want to impose that same exact system over the entire globe.
[00:23:38.361 --> 00:23:48.865]  And this is why we're cranking up for war in the Mideast, because in order for the Western-style banking system to become the global standard, all the nations using the Islamic banking system have to be conquered.
[00:23:49.186 --> 00:23:51.072]  That's what the clash of civilizations is.
[00:23:51.372 --> 00:23:53.479]  It's a war between banking systems.
[00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:59.711]  Now, this is their big gamble.
[00:23:59.831 --> 00:24:03.354]  I mean, they've got Homeland Security, NORTHCOM openly set up to suppress the people.
[00:24:03.394 --> 00:24:05.075]  They're federalizing all the local police.
[00:24:05.115 --> 00:24:06.316]  They're putting in surveillance.
[00:24:06.956 --> 00:24:08.357]  They're trampling the Bill of Rights.
[00:24:08.437 --> 00:24:09.998]  Federal courts everywhere are ruling.
[00:24:10.279 --> 00:24:11.399]  There's no Fourth Amendment.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.121]  They clearly are going for broke.
[00:24:15.242 --> 00:24:22.247]  You say you don't think they'll get away with it, and I think there's a chance that you're right, but they're still going ahead with it.
[00:24:22.567 --> 00:24:23.808]  How do you see this unfolding?
[00:24:24.537 --> 00:24:37.149]  Well, I think the reason they're going ahead with it is, first of all, there's a lot of social inertia in that governmental structure, and the people in charge are really still kind of living back at the height of the Cold War, which is why they're waving missiles at the Russians again.
[00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:44.896]  And the problem is that the people who are at the top of these pyramids, they're really old, very rich, ultra-rich and powerful people,
[00:24:45.496 --> 00:24:54.342]  Don't really understand the very fundamental change to the nature information flows through our society brought by the Internet, by the alternative media.
[00:24:54.663 --> 00:24:59.886]  They're still playing the game by the rules that worked at the height of the Cold War in the 1950s, 1960s.
[00:24:59.986 --> 00:25:04.990]  And had they done this, what they're doing today, 50 years ago, they probably would have been able to work.
[00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:06.952]  Today, I don't think so.
[00:25:07.252 --> 00:25:14.019]  And we're seeing more and more people around the world getting angry and starting to kick this old-style government and economic system out.
[00:25:14.039 --> 00:25:15.020]  They did it in Iceland.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.501]  They're getting ready to do it in Greece.
[00:25:16.761 --> 00:25:19.164]  I think it could even happen here in the United States very soon.
[00:25:23.308 --> 00:25:25.010]  But, we go back to the same issue.
[00:25:26.704 --> 00:25:37.306]  They are just continuing their takeover and the states are moving, more than 30 of them, to declare Tenth Amendment, Ninth Amendment powers over the federal government.
[00:25:37.326 --> 00:25:41.527]  The mainstream media spins that to say, oh, the states want rebellion, they want to secede.
[00:25:41.667 --> 00:25:56.310]  No, they want to implement the Ninth and Tenth Amendments saying the states created you, you don't have these powers that you've claimed, you keep giving us unfunded mandates, you keep taking our tax money and then sending part of it back with strings attached
[00:25:57.411 --> 00:26:00.493]  Washington is run by foreign countries and big corporations.
[00:26:01.573 --> 00:26:04.235]  Congress now has an 8% approval rating.
[00:26:04.295 --> 00:26:04.936]  Ron Paul has an 84.
[00:26:06.337 --> 00:26:10.740]  Again, showing that they have lost the war for the hearts and minds of the people.
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:14.542]  And so I agree with you that we've got a really good chance of
[00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:40.842]  Somehow displacing these people and just arresting this lot of Kinley slash Madoff types, but still you have the fact that if they wreck us bad enough financially, then the federal government's the only thing big enough and they control the fiat money machine to basically buy off enough people, you know, with their little credits on their welfare cards.
[00:26:41.522 --> 00:26:41.702]  to go
[00:27:03.312 --> 00:27:06.713]  Right at 1,800,000 jobs being lost a month.
[00:27:06.753 --> 00:27:09.935]  This is clearly a depression that we're in.
[00:27:10.355 --> 00:27:13.716]  Oil surges to $79 as the dollar plunges.
[00:27:14.436 --> 00:27:18.758]  Gold reaches its six-week high of $1,125.50.
[00:27:18.798 --> 00:27:20.639]  We've got Medicare cut across the country 21%.
[00:27:27.808 --> 00:27:29.309]  Outside of any legislation.
[00:27:29.829 --> 00:27:30.629]  That's in the news.
[00:27:30.669 --> 00:27:37.732]  I mean, all of this is going on and we see the signals by the media and the government that they want to start clamping down on the internet.
[00:27:38.333 --> 00:27:40.233]  That's my next point I have for you.
[00:27:40.794 --> 00:27:42.915]  I was trying to go to this article.
[00:27:43.875 --> 00:27:50.762]  Out of Blogspot today, headline, Mr. Larry Pullet Silverstein, did you commit insurance fraud on 9-11?
[00:27:51.342 --> 00:27:58.169]  And it's a pretty mild article, just basing the facts on all this record insurance he bought and the fact that Building 7 was clearly blown up.
[00:27:58.769 --> 00:28:00.291]  Give me a document cam shot, guys.
[00:28:00.311 --> 00:28:04.715]  There's a little bit of doodling on here, but the point is, content warning.
[00:28:05.015 --> 00:28:07.498]  When I tried to go to Blogger, Google,
[00:28:08.098 --> 00:28:09.780]  Which isn't even the browser I use.
[00:28:10.361 --> 00:28:18.589]  Somehow laid this over the template and I'm getting reports and people are sending me screenshots for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:28:18.609 --> 00:28:19.550]  This is happening as well.
[00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:25.654]  It says some readers of this blog have contacted Google because they believe this blog contains objectionable.
[00:28:25.754 --> 00:28:26.775]  That's what they do in Australia.
[00:28:26.795 --> 00:28:29.937]  Somebody flags a site and it's blocked out of the entire network nationwide.
[00:28:30.378 --> 00:28:34.461]  So some readers of this blog have contacted Google because they believe this blog content is objectionable.
[00:28:35.022 --> 00:28:40.446]  In general, Google does not review nor do we endorse the content of this or any blog.
[00:28:40.667 --> 00:28:46.131]  For more information about our content policies, please visit bloggertermsofservice.com.
[00:28:47.052 --> 00:28:50.993]  And so, more and more, we're seeing these warnings.
[00:28:51.174 --> 00:28:54.235]  Oh, this is information questioning 9-11.
[00:28:54.515 --> 00:28:56.155]  Are you sure you want to go to this?
[00:28:56.235 --> 00:28:57.176]  It may be dangerous.
[00:28:57.236 --> 00:28:58.076]  It may be bad.
[00:28:58.496 --> 00:29:05.158]  And we see all this cryptome getting shut down last week by Microsoft, just without a court order, without anything.
[00:29:05.198 --> 00:29:06.659]  We see open calls for this.
[00:29:07.119 --> 00:29:09.600]  Mike Rivero, comment on the attacks on the Internet.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.581]  Well, you're absolutely correct.
[00:29:12.581 --> 00:29:26.969]  I think the Copenhagen disaster and the Climategate scandal was the wake-up call for the powers that think they are, where they're finally beginning to realize they've lost the ability to lie the people of the world into going to whatever direction they want to go.
[00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:33.253]  They're just now realizing they can't sell us the wars they want anymore, they can't always sell us the presidents they're going to want.
[00:29:33.593 --> 00:29:35.636]  The American people are angry with the government.
[00:29:35.656 --> 00:29:36.918]  They're starting to turn away.
[00:29:37.178 --> 00:29:40.042]  They've lost trust, not only in the government, but in the corporate media.
[00:29:40.583 --> 00:29:50.997]  And so we know that Cass Sunstein, Obama's czar, was saying, well, if we can't automatically wave a magic wand and bring the public's trust back to the government and the corporate media,
[00:29:51.397 --> 00:29:59.384]  Then let's go out and start destroying the trust they have in the alternative media and the blogosphere to at least, you know, level the playing field.
[00:29:59.404 --> 00:30:06.990]  And then we'll spend a lot of money back at the TV networks for really beautiful high-tech sets and a lot of really pretty people and see if we can lure the people back that way.
[00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:08.171]  But it really isn't working.
[00:30:08.231 --> 00:30:09.672]  Again, it's Cold War mindset.
[00:30:10.092 --> 00:30:20.835]  And the bottom line is, all these little warnings that are going up there are just telling people, okay, this is something that some vested interest doesn't want me to see, and it's going to have the banned in Boston effect.
[00:30:21.115 --> 00:30:26.716]  People go right past those warnings, and they say, oh wow, there's got to be something really tasty in here now.
[00:30:26.856 --> 00:30:30.617]  And so I think it's actually having the opposite effect from what is being intended.
[00:30:31.257 --> 00:30:37.279]  But it's setting the precedent for them to start gatekeeping according to anonymous complaints.
[00:30:38.516 --> 00:30:49.146]  Well, I think that's where they want to go with that, but I think the American people are going to understand that that basically is the hallmark of the dictatorship.
[00:30:49.186 --> 00:30:58.816]  And I think at the point where they start saying you cannot look at certain websites any longer is when America is going to lose any last remaining denial that it has about what this country has become.
[00:31:00.337 --> 00:31:01.258]  I agree with you.
[00:31:02.079 --> 00:31:02.679]  Separately,
[00:31:04.005 --> 00:31:13.676]  Now, not just the borders, but at airports everywhere, the federal government says they have the right without due process, without probable cause, without... What's the exact quote here?
[00:31:13.696 --> 00:31:21.504]  I actually had the Seattle Times, it's also in the LA Times, it's a Hugo Martin article published in both.
[00:31:22.085 --> 00:31:25.448]  No curbs on border surges of cell phones and laptops, and then it says,
[00:31:26.531 --> 00:31:26.811]  U.S.
[00:31:26.871 --> 00:31:40.360]  Customs and airports, so separately, are taking electronic devices without first establishing suspicion of wrongdoing and keeping them for sometimes six weeks and downloading everything off of them without warrants.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:44.202]  We know whatever they do in the airports is a beta test for the wider society.
[00:31:44.242 --> 00:31:46.384]  I mean, this is worse than Communist China.
[00:31:47.301 --> 00:31:48.382]  Yeah, it absolutely is.
[00:31:48.442 --> 00:31:52.524]  I mean, we're already hearing that they're going to start putting the naked scanners in bus and train stations.
[00:31:52.925 --> 00:32:01.170]  And this idea of grabbing somebody's portable electronic device and simply looting it, I mean, this is such a dangerous situation.
[00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:08.095]  Not because we're necessarily carrying anything electronic or terror plans or anything like that.
[00:32:08.315 --> 00:32:11.497]  Basically, they're trying to enforce the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
[00:32:11.757 --> 00:32:15.439]  They're basically trying to make sure you don't have pirated music and movies on there.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.040]  Without due process!
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:17.120]  Without due process.
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:17.760]  They just do it.
[00:32:17.821 --> 00:32:19.601]  They just line you up and take your goods.
[00:32:20.341 --> 00:32:24.663]  The Nazis just lined you up and took your papers and looked at them.
[00:32:25.183 --> 00:32:27.644]  We're just taking this from you.
[00:32:27.684 --> 00:32:34.786]  The problem I have with this is that a lot of us are carrying information data on our cell phones, on our laptops.
[00:32:35.186 --> 00:32:37.228]  That may be confidential to our clients.
[00:32:37.588 --> 00:32:48.336]  And we already know that every time the FBI gets something they think they can use to do some insider stock trading, they've been caught doing insider trading with information they loot from cell phones and laptops and phone taps.
[00:32:48.536 --> 00:32:49.136]  Exactly!
[00:32:49.176 --> 00:32:55.081]  They admit this is being dumped into the NSA database and the government hands it out to all their criminal friends.
[00:32:56.036 --> 00:33:01.960]  Absolutely, which opens up opportunities to basically for government insiders to make money off of your work.
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:11.106]  In my day job, I have information, visuals that belong to my clients that are not supposed to get out in the public until after the program has aired.
[00:33:11.226 --> 00:33:15.589]  If they get out early and get into People Magazine or something, I'm in real big trouble.
[00:33:15.609 --> 00:33:15.889]  That's right.
[00:33:15.929 --> 00:33:18.851]  I mean, you work on some of the hottest TV shows out there.
[00:33:19.537 --> 00:33:26.980]  Yes, and you know, some guy at TSA sees a compromising picture of a star, sells it to his buddy over at the Fan Magazine.
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:32.923]  They all make money and I get in trouble because I'm not taking proper care of the proprietary information.
[00:33:32.943 --> 00:33:39.246]  And they already got caught in England last month with a TV movie star taking his naked photo in the scanner.
[00:33:40.046 --> 00:33:40.906]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:33:40.946 --> 00:33:43.927]  So we cannot trust these people with our data.
[00:33:44.047 --> 00:33:54.730]  And so basically, what the government is saying is that, you know, they have the right to come into our place of business, which is our cell phone, and simply rifle through and anything they find useful, they're going to take and sell.
[00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:59.951]  And meanwhile, you know, anything that we have that they don't think we should have, they're going to throw us in jail about.
[00:33:59.971 --> 00:34:01.952]  Well, they can also frame you with it.
[00:34:02.612 --> 00:34:07.220]  Yeah, they can plant data on that device just as easily as they can take it off.
[00:34:07.661 --> 00:34:08.442]  And that's the real danger.
[00:34:08.462 --> 00:34:13.591]  How many videos do we see from cops on squad cars where they do hand signals and plant drugs on people?
[00:34:14.548 --> 00:34:30.897]  It's a major problem and they could put something like, we already have seen cases where hackers working for example for Israel will hack into somebody's computer and plant child porn and then call the authorities on somebody to get them busted and it's just a huge problem.
[00:34:30.937 --> 00:34:36.901]  Somebody could take an iPhone going through the gate and then come up to you later on and say we found this picture of an underage girl
[00:34:37.501 --> 00:34:44.664]  You know, whatever, and then you get to go off to jail and they put you in the sexual predator register and basically destroy your life.
[00:34:45.784 --> 00:34:51.806]  And it all comes down to the fact that we cannot trust this government with our personal data.
[00:34:52.087 --> 00:34:56.708]  And this is why we should be very angry about this idea that they're going to be grabbing our cell phones and laptops.
[00:34:57.168 --> 00:34:59.029]  It's not because we've got anything to hide.
[00:34:59.349 --> 00:35:03.831]  It's just that we have a government that thinks it already owns all of our own private
[00:35:03.931 --> 00:35:16.504]  And that's why we have the precious Fourth Amendment, this hedge around us from the experiences of an oppressive government that our forebearers went through when they traveled from Europe to the colonies and what they went through in the colonies.
[00:35:17.205 --> 00:35:23.631]  I mean, it's just common sense and these precious ancient rights that go back to before the Magna Carta.
[00:35:24.505 --> 00:35:28.729]  I mean, think about eight years ago, everybody freaked out over the Patriot Act.
[00:35:28.789 --> 00:35:51.668]  Now, without even a whimper, Obama reauthorizes the worst provisions, the whole thing, and there's almost no fanfare with it, and their naked body recording us and seizing our laptops, and public schools are watching children through the laptops at home without warrants, and they think it's so normal, they tell on themselves and say, yeah, we're watching you, this is freedom.
[00:35:52.867 --> 00:35:57.349]  This is what the founders wanted, was laptops watching you in your bedroom, you know, without warrants.
[00:35:57.469 --> 00:36:03.911]  I mean, this is unbelievable, and it's just getting worse by the day, by the week, by the month, by the year.
[00:36:04.131 --> 00:36:06.712]  I mean, think how far we've come the last eight and a half years since 9-11.
[00:36:06.952 --> 00:36:07.792]  Where are we going?
[00:36:08.092 --> 00:36:12.254]  Two segments straight ahead with Mike Rivero, your phone calls from Oregon, Germany, you name it.
[00:36:14.753 --> 00:36:16.154]  Is it safe to breathe anymore?
[00:36:16.394 --> 00:36:27.502]  Crowded public places, global pandemics and news reports of potential new strains of bacteria and viruses make you wonder, what if there was a germ killing nasal spray that acted almost like hand sanitizer for your nose?
[00:36:27.842 --> 00:36:28.442]  There is!
[00:36:28.822 --> 00:36:32.545]  It's called Sinofresh homeopathic nasal spray and it's a proven germ killer.
[00:36:32.885 --> 00:36:41.092]  Sinofresh is a revolutionary doctor-recommended nasal spray that kills a broad spectrum of viruses, bacteria, molds, and fungi on contact in your nose.
[00:36:41.472 --> 00:36:49.319]  Sinofresh causes no drug interactions, no loss of smell, no rebound congestion, contains no alcohol, is non-habit forming, and is safe for daily use.
[00:36:49.619 --> 00:36:52.101]  Sinofresh must be a part of your family survival plan.

[00:37:10.912 --> 00:37:11.472]  It works.
[00:37:13.396 --> 00:37:14.656]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:37:14.696 --> 00:37:20.038]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:37:20.278 --> 00:37:24.899]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:37:25.299 --> 00:37:30.361]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.

[00:39:32.006 --> 00:39:34.428]  They bring us into an open depression.
[00:39:34.829 --> 00:39:38.292]  They can shut it down as CNN's pumping, as the White House is promoting.
[00:39:39.673 --> 00:39:41.594]  We need your financial support as well.
[00:39:41.635 --> 00:39:56.205]  When you buy the books, the videos, the ball caps, the Patriot t-shirts, they're all materials that wake people up, that help you interface with others, that help you identify yourself at city council or work or on the street with other like-minded people to form your own communities.

[00:40:25.455 --> 00:40:27.137]  Larry, you're on the air with Mike Rivera.
[00:40:27.177 --> 00:40:27.557]  Go ahead.
[00:40:29.819 --> 00:40:30.740]  Yeah, hey Larry, Mike.
[00:40:33.242 --> 00:40:34.604]  Alex, I got two things.
[00:40:34.624 --> 00:40:35.845]  Can you hear me okay?
[00:40:36.065 --> 00:40:36.606]  Yes, I can.
[00:40:37.687 --> 00:40:43.312]  Yeah, it's about Glenn Beck and Chris Matthews and people like that.
[00:40:44.893 --> 00:40:45.574]  My question is,
[00:40:46.375 --> 00:40:58.159]  Um, we know that they're phonies and that, but they're also working towards an agenda with what they come out with and that it's a highly, uh, sophisticated PSYOP.
[00:40:58.819 --> 00:41:06.942]  But, but it's also, we know that it's not personally them that's doing that and their ideas and stuff.
[00:41:06.962 --> 00:41:13.964]  So my question is, how do you think, who gives them their orders and how does this, how do they,
[00:41:15.803 --> 00:41:20.265]  You know, who's telling them what to do and running that agenda?
[00:41:20.545 --> 00:41:23.166]  Let me comment on that and get Mike Rivero's take on it.
[00:41:23.866 --> 00:41:25.367]  Okay, it's sophisticated.
[00:41:25.387 --> 00:41:27.807]  Chris Matthews has been a political operative for 30 years.
[00:41:28.248 --> 00:41:29.648]  That is what Chris Matthews believes.
[00:41:30.028 --> 00:41:36.270]  And they'll get a talking point when Ron Paul is surging in the polls for president to come out and say his supporters are dangerous, he's bad, he's racist.
[00:41:36.851 --> 00:41:39.412]  And then Beck and Matthews put that out.
[00:41:39.732 --> 00:41:42.873]  Once he's driven down in the polls, they can have him on and make themselves look good.
[00:41:44.214 --> 00:41:45.395]  They get talking points.
[00:41:45.435 --> 00:41:47.938]  This is on record about what they're pushing.
[00:41:47.959 --> 00:41:51.923]  So you see Matthew Zahnbeck pushing new taxes to pay the bankers.
[00:41:52.384 --> 00:41:54.306]  I mean, it's very transparent.
[00:41:54.366 --> 00:42:00.975]  Their teleprompters are loaded for them on talking points, and then when they have guests on, they just regurgitate those talking points.
[00:42:01.315 --> 00:42:01.896]  Mike Rivera.
[00:42:02.642 --> 00:42:03.623]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:42:03.663 --> 00:42:10.410]  I mean, the messages sent in, you know, and it's not exactly that they sit in an office and somebody says, you will tell this to your audience.
[00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:27.106]  But when they go to parties and dinners and on the golf course and they have discussions with their backers and supporters and friends, it's this little sort of gentleman's club or this little clique where they're saying, this is what the agenda is going to be to serve the collective good of the very, very rich people.
[00:42:27.646 --> 00:42:47.101]  And the general way that it operates is somebody like a Glenn Beck will come out, and for a while he'll say the things that we all want to hear, and then slowly he'll start turning around and start trying to lead us back into the folds, like the way a sheepdog will try and get some errant sheep and nudge them back into the greater flock.
[00:42:47.381 --> 00:42:48.982]  And that's kind of what they're doing here.
[00:42:49.423 --> 00:42:57.408]  And so every once in a while, you'll see somebody and you'll say, yeah, I love the way that, you know, that Glenn Beck is saying the things I want to hear and Keith Olbermann is saying all the good things.
[00:42:57.688 --> 00:43:02.452]  And then once they've built the audience, then they basically start towing them back.
[00:43:02.472 --> 00:43:03.993]  Well, I mean, here's an example.
[00:43:04.373 --> 00:43:05.974]  There was a Politico article yesterday.
[00:43:05.994 --> 00:43:06.915]  I never got it to it.
[00:43:07.956 --> 00:43:11.238]  It had a headline like Republicans go after radicals in their own party.
[00:43:11.258 --> 00:43:12.158]  Will you print that for me?
[00:43:12.539 --> 00:43:16.762]  And it had top Republican strategists saying we're going after the birthers.
[00:43:17.442 --> 00:43:18.883]  We're going after the truthers.
[00:43:18.963 --> 00:43:21.585]  We're going after people that don't like the Federal Reserve.
[00:43:21.985 --> 00:43:23.806]  We're targeting them and demonizing them.
[00:43:23.846 --> 00:43:31.811]  So, they have the real talking points get written by their strategists, put out, and then they load that into teleprompters and follow it.
[00:43:31.831 --> 00:43:35.774]  And it's come out in 2000 that CNN is full of CIA operatives.
[00:43:36.734 --> 00:43:40.437]  Literally scripting it, so there is some actual scripting that's going on.
[00:43:40.457 --> 00:43:44.981]  We're going to come back with another segment with Mike Rivero, talk to Karen, John, Herman, Bob, and others.
[00:43:45.982 --> 00:43:51.266]  Coming up in about 35 minutes, we're joined by the folks that have the ATF take their BB guns.
[00:43:53.448 --> 00:43:58.492]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:43:59.153 --> 00:44:02.356]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:44:03.197 --> 00:44:05.919]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.
[00:44:06.219 --> 00:44:11.984]  Well, here's an unbelievable chance for you to jumpstart your food savings plan from efoodsdirect.com.
[00:44:12.244 --> 00:44:20.090]  Anyone placing food orders on the large-volume production run scheduled for the week of March 22nd can get a lot of food for very little cost.
[00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:26.617]  For example, with each pre-production order of three seven-day responders, they'll ship a fourth week of food free.
[00:44:26.878 --> 00:44:28.840]  That's buy three, get one free.
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:31.764]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[00:44:31.944 --> 00:44:39.513]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you in this buy three, get one free program.
[00:44:39.913 --> 00:44:42.794]  Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see.
[00:44:43.174 --> 00:44:44.015]  Another example?
[00:44:44.235 --> 00:44:47.276]  Buy nine months worth of food and get three months free.
[00:44:47.416 --> 00:44:52.558]  You've got to go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex for the food buy of a lifetime.
[00:44:52.578 --> 00:44:53.338]  Or call 800-409-5633.
[00:44:53.378 --> 00:44:54.438]  Go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex or 800-409-5633.
[00:45:05.985 --> 00:45:07.926]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:45:08.387 --> 00:45:11.228]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:45:17.712 --> 00:45:18.353]  Big Brother.
[00:45:19.013 --> 00:45:20.094]  Mainstream media.
[00:45:20.774 --> 00:45:21.895]  Government cover-ups.
[00:45:22.536 --> 00:45:23.376]  You want answers?
[00:45:24.137 --> 00:45:25.097]  Well, so does he.
[00:45:25.678 --> 00:45:29.440]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:33.943]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:45:34.994 --> 00:45:37.455]  We're going to continue to have open phones in this hour.
[00:45:37.495 --> 00:45:44.498]  We have a guest popping in at the bottom of the hour who had their right to commerce and their Second Amendment violated in a big way.
[00:45:44.558 --> 00:45:45.418]  It's not even a Second Amendment.
[00:45:45.578 --> 00:45:49.599]  You can't have airsoft, plastic pellet BB guns now, according to the ATF.
[00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:51.060]  That is coming up.
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:53.721]  Mike Rivera is our guest for another five minutes.
[00:45:54.101 --> 00:45:55.682]  Karen in Oregon, you're on the air.
[00:45:55.722 --> 00:45:56.102]  Go ahead.
[00:45:59.118 --> 00:46:01.380]  And thank you Alex for taking my call.
[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:07.785]  I am organizing a national strike and I just have some groundbreaking news that just happened.
[00:46:08.766 --> 00:46:09.086]  Okay.
[00:46:10.228 --> 00:46:18.873]  Bob Schultz from We The People Foundation and Continental Congress have fully endorsed the strike at TaxFree15.com.
[00:46:19.374 --> 00:46:25.477]  Ma'am, what I'm going to do is, because you're calling in almost every day and I've asked the guys to get you on, we're going to put you on hold, get your name and number.
[00:46:25.497 --> 00:46:26.698]  I've heard you on other shows.
[00:46:26.738 --> 00:46:27.378]  I know what you're doing.
[00:46:27.418 --> 00:46:29.300]  I think it's very good what you're doing.
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:32.882]  I've even listened to Mike's show and heard you call in from memory last week.
[00:46:33.222 --> 00:46:35.223]  So we're going to get your name and number right now.
[00:46:35.944 --> 00:46:38.205]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Washington.
[00:46:38.265 --> 00:46:39.146]  John, you're on the air.
[00:46:39.186 --> 00:46:39.526]  Go ahead.
[00:46:40.548 --> 00:46:43.449]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[00:46:43.969 --> 00:46:44.869]  Hello, can you hear me?
[00:46:45.089 --> 00:46:46.430]  Yes, I can hear you very well.
[00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:47.070]  Can you hear me?
[00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:48.970]  Yes.
[00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:51.211]  I was calling back.
[00:46:51.331 --> 00:46:55.212]  I actually called last week and asked you to come to Spokane, Washington, Gonzaga.
[00:46:55.672 --> 00:46:59.673]  And I just want to let you know that you're a great inspiration to all those people out there.
[00:47:00.771 --> 00:47:06.094]  I started a website up, and it's got over 2,000 hits in the first three days.
[00:47:06.574 --> 00:47:07.974]  Yeah, people are interested in freedom.
[00:47:08.595 --> 00:47:09.275]  Exactly.
[00:47:09.595 --> 00:47:12.417]  And I'm really happy about the movement.
[00:47:12.437 --> 00:47:20.400]  We have people coming from an hour and a half away that want to pass out flyers, and I just wanted to say thank you for all the work you do.
[00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:21.301]  Well, give us the website.
[00:47:21.321 --> 00:47:22.321]  I want to thank you, John.
[00:47:22.361 --> 00:47:23.142]  Give us the website.
[00:47:23.522 --> 00:47:26.383]  It is www.FindingTruth509.com.
[00:47:28.334 --> 00:47:34.777]  If you type that in Google, it's actually number one, and that has been three days, so I just want to let people know.
[00:47:34.797 --> 00:47:36.338]  All right, awesome job, John.
[00:47:36.358 --> 00:47:42.581]  I want to give Mike some time because he's here with us at the end as we're opening the phones up for questions or comments from Mike.
[00:47:43.301 --> 00:47:48.503]  Mike, the good news is people are becoming politically active, and they don't have to save the world with one stroke.
[00:47:49.164 --> 00:47:54.506]  Put a website up, put up flyers, go to City Council, start an AXS TV show, start a local radio show.
[00:47:54.846 --> 00:47:56.567]  I mean, we really are seeing a
[00:47:57.628 --> 00:48:06.755]  Absolutely, and that's just wonderful to see happen, because the very best thing that anybody can do, because, you know, they call in and say, what can I do to help and everything?
[00:48:06.995 --> 00:48:15.642]  The very best thing you can do is speak out, share your concerns with everybody around you, because the more you speak out, the more you're going to give courage to others to speak out.
[00:48:16.042 --> 00:48:27.308]  Because the biggest lie the government is telling all of us is that those who are unhappy with the government are this tiny little fringe minority who really no polite company should tolerate and they should just go away and stay silent.
[00:48:27.588 --> 00:48:37.314]  But when you all speak out at the same time you begin to realize that it really is a majority of Americans are totally fed up, they're furious with the federal government, they think the time has come for a change.
[00:48:39.122 --> 00:48:46.490]  And if enough of us wake up and speak out and just do little things every day, the illusion is going to completely implode.
[00:48:47.618 --> 00:48:48.379]  Absolutely.
[00:48:48.499 --> 00:48:50.821]  I mean, I think the illusion has already imploded.
[00:48:51.201 --> 00:48:56.666]  I think the idea that the government is ruling with the consent of the governed, that one is completely gone at this point.
[00:48:56.946 --> 00:49:01.730]  The polls are always showing the people of America see the government as the biggest threat to their freedom.
[00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:03.311]  They are angry with the government.
[00:49:03.331 --> 00:49:04.512]  They don't trust the government.
[00:49:05.033 --> 00:49:13.380]  Support for the government, I think, if you discount all the people who are getting a government paycheck, support for the federal government has collapsed completely at this point.
[00:49:14.893 --> 00:49:20.896]  And when the media tells us the economy's getting better and people know it's getting worse, again, they're just bleeding out.
[00:49:20.916 --> 00:49:23.838]  They're losing whatever little bit of credibility and mystique.
[00:49:23.898 --> 00:49:29.701]  I see the statistics now that came out today that the internet is now way bigger than the mainstream media put together.
[00:49:29.721 --> 00:49:31.322]  I mean, they are in freefall.
[00:49:32.002 --> 00:49:32.983]  They absolutely are.
[00:49:33.023 --> 00:49:34.123]  They're losing their audience.
[00:49:34.163 --> 00:49:35.404]  The audience is coming over to me.
[00:49:35.724 --> 00:49:40.286]  We just upgraded to a new server only two weeks ago and already it's swamped and saturated.
[00:49:40.787 --> 00:49:42.928]  And I mean, that's how fast this thing is growing.
[00:49:44.147 --> 00:49:45.088]  It's unbelievable, Mike.
[00:49:45.108 --> 00:49:47.109]  We'll talk to you again live next month.
[00:49:47.149 --> 00:49:48.970]  Thank you for spending the last hour with us.
[00:49:49.551 --> 00:49:51.092]  Thank you very much for having me, Alex.
[00:49:51.152 --> 00:49:51.832]  I look forward to it.
[00:49:52.532 --> 00:49:53.593]  And we look forward to it as well.
[00:49:53.653 --> 00:49:55.775]  Mike Rivera, always interesting and informative.
[00:49:56.175 --> 00:50:05.261]  OK, coming up, I'm going to get into the economy, a news blitz, more of your phone calls, and in about 30 minutes, we've got a guest on violated big time by the ATF.
[00:50:05.281 --> 00:50:07.222]  Talk about a lawless group.
[00:50:07.682 --> 00:50:10.724]  I mean, these guys are criminal by any measurement.
[00:50:10.984 --> 00:50:11.725]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:13.277 --> 00:50:18.564]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[00:50:18.604 --> 00:50:21.328]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:50:21.348 --> 00:50:27.016]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:50:28.097 --> 00:50:31.138]  Order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[00:50:39.239 --> 00:50:47.140]  It exposes how a cashless society, surveillance beast grid of total control is being put into place.
[00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:48.881]  This film needs to be seen.
[00:50:49.161 --> 00:50:50.081]  Everybody needs to get it.

[00:51:13.015 --> 00:51:17.238]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:51:17.558 --> 00:51:21.641]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:51:21.901 --> 00:51:27.304]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:51:27.644 --> 00:51:28.105]  It's true.
[00:51:28.405 --> 00:51:32.948]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:51:33.248 --> 00:51:33.809]  Number 3.
[00:51:34.089 --> 00:51:37.371]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:51:37.672 --> 00:51:41.415]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:51:41.595 --> 00:51:42.135]  Number 4.
[00:51:42.376 --> 00:51:44.758]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:51:45.138 --> 00:51:48.521]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.

[00:53:14.774 --> 00:53:20.817]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:53:21.417 --> 00:53:24.379]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:53:32.938 --> 00:53:37.803]  Coming up, Supreme Court weighs Chicago's strict gun ban.
[00:53:37.963 --> 00:53:41.246]  ABC News, there's an AP report here.
[00:53:41.286 --> 00:53:43.969]  Supreme Court scrutinizes state local gun control.
[00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:47.172]  The gun grabbers are in here saying this may be good for us.
[00:53:47.652 --> 00:53:49.034]  We'll explain why.
[00:53:50.233 --> 00:54:04.237]  Coming up, I'm also going to get into some other important news that we haven't even covered yet, like green fuels cause more harm than fossil fuels, according to a report this out of the London Times.
[00:54:04.297 --> 00:54:05.418]  Now, we already knew this.
[00:54:06.098 --> 00:54:07.759]  So why is the UN pushing it?
[00:54:08.199 --> 00:54:18.202]  Because they know it caused tens of millions, that's a conservative number, of more people to starve to death in the last five years per year than previously were.
[00:54:19.986 --> 00:54:24.769]  Over a billion people are living on the edge of starvation, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:25.289 --> 00:54:31.632]  Our poorest live like kings compared to people in many areas of Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
[00:54:32.232 --> 00:54:36.114]  So we're going to be breaking that down coming up as well.
[00:54:36.955 --> 00:54:46.600]  I talked about some of this in the first hour and we discussed it as well in the second with Mike Rivero, but I want to really flesh this out for people.
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:55:04.947]  How do we get the word out to the public that it's the private central banks bringing in the green tyranny, the fake environmentalism, the taxing system, the bank of the world, the global government that engineered the financial collapse, that have built the big government so they could get us into debt and control us?
[00:55:05.947 --> 00:55:09.228]  How do we get the word out to the people that it's worse than they even know?
[00:55:09.769 --> 00:55:17.492]  The average person knows the economy's falling apart, but do they know in the last month, every week,
[00:55:19.488 --> 00:55:21.510]  496,000 jobs were lost.
[00:55:21.550 --> 00:55:24.252]  That's almost 2 million in a month.
[00:55:24.572 --> 00:55:24.252]  1,800,000.
[00:55:24.692 --> 00:55:28.435]  That is so incredible and that's from CNN.
[00:55:29.616 --> 00:55:46.589]  We have oil starting to go back up in price and other commodities because the central banks that met in secret three weeks ago in Australia are in a concerted, coordinated operation to lower currencies in tandem so that the public doesn't notice it as much.
[00:55:48.046 --> 00:55:56.029]  Just like if the Mexican peso started going down, the dollar goes down with it, so you don't notice overall that, hey, my dollar isn't worth as much next to the peso.
[00:55:56.629 --> 00:56:06.452]  We've got gold at a six-week high of $1,125.50, and it's trending up even higher in its futures market.
[00:56:06.512 --> 00:56:10.514]  What the different markets are saying, it'll be in the days and weeks to come.
[00:56:11.468 --> 00:56:19.232]  And then I've got articles here, you know, you've heard Obama and others say, oh, we're going to give you all this free health care, but oh, we've got to pass this to cut back on health care costs.
[00:56:20.393 --> 00:56:26.116]  And then you see all these big insurance stock owners running around.
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:32.864]  Like the owner of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett, saying we need this government healthcare.
[00:56:33.284 --> 00:56:37.968]  And then when Obama said, oh, looks like we may pass it in the next few weeks, it went back up again.
[00:56:38.488 --> 00:56:45.954]  All the major insurance companies, medical insurance companies, stock went up because this is a legislation written by them.
[00:56:47.375 --> 00:56:52.981]  And simultaneously, it's being reported all over the country, Medicare payment reductions worry doctors' patients.
[00:56:53.001 --> 00:56:53.702]  This is out of St.
[00:56:53.742 --> 00:56:55.364]  Petersburg, News 9.
[00:56:56.085 --> 00:57:01.571]  March begins with a financial blow for doctors who are facing major reduction of Medicare payments.
[00:57:01.591 --> 00:57:02.832]  Give me a document, Cam, on that.
[00:57:03.513 --> 00:57:11.995]  For PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, the 21% reduction is the result of what some say is an outdated reimbursement formula from the 1990s.
[00:57:12.455 --> 00:57:19.377]  Over the years, Congress managed to waive the deficit reduction measure, but legislatures failed to repeal it last week.
[00:57:19.917 --> 00:57:23.238]  And then similar things are happening all over the country.
[00:57:23.278 --> 00:57:25.939]  This is very, very serious.
[00:57:26.139 --> 00:57:30.460]  And so I wanted to get Ted Anderson up before we go to your calls for a few minutes because
[00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:39.490]  Over the weekend, the headline was, IMF chief Strauss Kahn says, new global currency, end of the dollar.
[00:57:40.251 --> 00:57:41.753]  But, dollar dominance.
[00:57:41.773 --> 00:57:45.978]  You'll still have a dollar, you'll still have a euro, you'll still have a pound, you'll still have a yen.
[00:57:48.274 --> 00:58:05.709]  But under this new global charter that Gordon Brown talked about two weeks ago, or a week and a half ago, Prime Minister of England, it's a charter where the banks that have taken over our nations openly sign agreements with each other, and executive agreements, unelected, unaccountable agreements,
[00:58:08.308 --> 00:58:12.574]  With the heads of the G20 and four other separate central banks.
[00:58:12.594 --> 00:58:15.419]  There's G20, but there's four others that met, so it's 24 total.
[00:58:15.919 --> 00:58:22.809]  I mean, this is a revolution of the banking structure now coming out and setting up open government.
[00:58:23.530 --> 00:58:29.413]  To shut off economies and bankrupt society for a post-industrial world or neo-feudalism.
[00:58:29.893 --> 00:58:30.354]  Serfdom.
[00:58:30.634 --> 00:58:33.635]  Guys, pull up a definition of neo-feudalism or serfdom for me.
[00:58:33.655 --> 00:58:37.217]  I want to read that before Ted leaves us here in the next 10 minutes or so.
[00:58:37.998 --> 00:58:40.639]  Ted Anderson, you know, you're here obviously to promote gold.
[00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:43.441]  I've shopped all over.
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:50.024]  A few times I bought silver a decade ago from other people, but you've always had the best deals.
[00:58:50.844 --> 00:58:52.305]  And you bought gold when it was $1,050.
[00:58:52.345 --> 00:58:53.146]  It's now $1,125 and rising.
[00:59:00.828 --> 00:59:12.125]  I just think it's so important for people to take advantage of what you do because you buy it when it dips and then you still sell it at the lower price when it goes up until you run out of supplies.
[00:59:12.626 --> 00:59:14.869]  Then you do things like give people a year's subscription.
[00:59:16.072 --> 00:59:20.755]  For free, when they make one coin order of a fifth of an ounce frank?
[00:59:20.775 --> 00:59:25.058]  I don't know if you can still offer that, but I didn't talk to you before we went on air, but you're with us.
[00:59:25.078 --> 00:59:33.985]  But I first wanted you to talk about your view, 30 years in the economy, in the gold and silver brokerage business, what you see happening.
[00:59:34.005 --> 00:59:36.727]  Because we've been right again, we've been predicting all of this, Ted.
[00:59:37.607 --> 00:59:38.808]  Yeah, you're right about that, Alex.
[00:59:40.461 --> 00:59:43.424]  Right now, the Europeans are watching gold go up.
[00:59:44.005 --> 00:59:45.726]  They've never seen it this high before.
[00:59:45.786 --> 00:59:48.149]  By the way, it is hitting a peak that they have never seen.
[00:59:48.169 --> 00:59:53.754]  And the reason why that is is because there was a rally here just a short time ago on the U.S.
[00:59:53.794 --> 00:59:56.677]  dollar against the euro when Greece was in trouble.
[00:59:57.429 --> 01:00:04.032]  And now the dollar is starting to slip back again, and gold right now did jump over that $11.25.
[01:00:04.172 --> 01:00:08.033]  It's at $11.3730 right now, and it's seen as high as $11.39.
[01:00:08.574 --> 01:00:10.254]  So it's really moving upwards.
[01:00:10.314 --> 01:00:11.075]  Oh, I didn't know that!
[01:00:11.135 --> 01:00:14.196]  So since I looked two hours ago, it went to $1,139.
[01:00:15.317 --> 01:00:17.617]  It's definitely running right now, Alex.
[01:00:17.818 --> 01:00:23.480]  And for the British pound, and for people that are trading in the European unit,
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:27.423]  That's right, the Times of London said three days ago the pound may crash in the next month.
[01:00:27.703 --> 01:00:30.826]  Yeah, well they're looking at a peak on gold that they've never seen before.
[01:00:30.966 --> 01:00:32.447]  And we'd be seeing it right now in the U.S.
[01:00:32.507 --> 01:00:34.348]  dollar too, except for we had this little rally.
[01:00:34.388 --> 01:00:35.229]  Let's explain that.
[01:00:35.389 --> 01:00:42.955]  England and Europe are seeing the highest level of gold ever, but we're only seeing it go up some because it's all about currencies.
[01:00:42.995 --> 01:00:43.936]  Currencies go down.
[01:00:43.976 --> 01:00:45.537]  The gold didn't really go up in price.
[01:00:45.837 --> 01:00:47.539]  Your currency's turning into toilet paper.
[01:00:47.979 --> 01:00:49.600]  Yep, that's exactly what's happening.
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:51.181]  And you look at Bloomberg, Reuters.
[01:00:51.201 --> 01:00:55.623]  I mean, there's a whole long list of news agencies out there, and they're all saying the same thing.
[01:00:55.923 --> 01:00:57.624]  Like, here's Bloomberg's headline right here.
[01:00:57.944 --> 01:01:02.167]  It says, Gold Climbs to Record in Pound, Euro as Investors Seek Haven.
[01:01:02.627 --> 01:01:03.648]  Here's one from Reuters.
[01:01:04.208 --> 01:01:08.410]  Gold Gains in New York on an Alternative Investment to Currencies.
[01:01:08.890 --> 01:01:10.511]  Here's another one from Reuters right here.
[01:01:10.891 --> 01:01:13.433]  Gold Extends Gains as Dollar Swings Lower.
[01:01:13.753 --> 01:01:15.354]  The dollar's dropping right now, Alex.
[01:01:15.754 --> 01:01:18.715]  And that's going to drive gold prices up for us here in the United States.
[01:01:19.075 --> 01:01:27.459]  It just happens to be that everybody else in the Western world is watching the gold prices increase and they've now seen a peak that's never been seen before.
[01:01:27.739 --> 01:01:32.241]  And by the way, Bob Chapman was just saying two weeks ago that in two weeks it would go up.
[01:01:32.361 --> 01:01:33.482]  I don't know how he knows this.
[01:01:34.249 --> 01:01:47.058]  Well, you know, Bob Chapman's pretty darn sharp, and I can tell you, he can see what's going on and what's developing better than a lot of other people can, because they're not brainwashed and thinking that the economy's going to be great forever.
[01:01:48.018 --> 01:01:52.902]  All you've got to do is take a look at the fundamental reasons why gold and silver go up and down.
[01:01:53.902 --> 01:02:02.548]  And realize what's going on when you see a country like Greece failing, and then they're asking the United States and the European Union to step in and bail them out.
[01:02:03.008 --> 01:02:04.769]  You know that there's trouble there.
[01:02:05.029 --> 01:02:14.515]  And what you've got is JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and others, this is even in mainstream Reuters, gobbling up different countries so that they don't scare everybody to implode at once.
[01:02:14.875 --> 01:02:20.079]  They pick us off like wolves pick off sheep, one at a time, one at a time, in wolf packs.
[01:02:20.979 --> 01:02:29.466]  And we saw the leader of the Democrats, that's up on PrisonPlanet.com, come out today and say the U.S.
[01:02:29.486 --> 01:02:32.708]  could crash like Greece.
[01:02:32.808 --> 01:02:35.910]  I mean, this is getting crazier and crazier.
[01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:42.595]  Here's the headline, House Majority Leader, Greek debt crisis can happen here, but then he holds everybody hostage and says,
[01:02:43.536 --> 01:02:49.902]  Accept higher taxes to the banks or they will lower our AAA bond rating.
[01:02:50.182 --> 01:02:51.943]  I mean, we are held hostage by these people.
[01:02:51.983 --> 01:03:00.731]  The only way you individually, in my opinion, get some type of protection from this is gold and silver.
[01:03:01.151 --> 01:03:02.933]  I mean, it's so fundamental.
[01:03:03.373 --> 01:03:04.034]  It really is.
[01:03:04.494 --> 01:03:06.856]  Gold and silver has been money for 6,000 years.
[01:03:07.296 --> 01:03:09.158]  And what you're watching is this pawn game
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:10.241]  I don't think so.
[01:03:21.906 --> 01:03:24.407]  Without having a loss in purchasing power.
[01:03:24.427 --> 01:03:26.967]  I mean, it's just, that's the way that the world works.
[01:03:27.448 --> 01:03:37.610]  And if you know that, and you see the United States government or the Federal Reserve System, I mean, for goodness sakes, they're trying to bail out Goldman Sachs' investments that they have sitting in Greece.
[01:03:37.930 --> 01:03:41.932]  I mean, what more does the taxpayer of the United States have to take on?
[01:03:41.952 --> 01:03:43.792]  Ted, absolutely, Ted.
[01:03:44.172 --> 01:03:44.832]  It's incredible.
[01:03:45.192 --> 01:03:46.973]  Fire out the offers for folks.
[01:03:47.253 --> 01:03:49.397]  Yeah, right now what we have is we have the Frank.
[01:03:49.437 --> 01:03:51.200]  They've edged up a little bit in price.
[01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:52.923]  They're at $261.61.
[01:03:53.364 --> 01:03:59.555]  But that's still, if you buy one of those, you'll get a full year subscription to the International Forecaster.
[01:04:00.205 --> 01:04:02.026]  And that brings it down to $510 per ounce.
[01:04:02.046 --> 01:04:09.831]  I mean, you'd have to go back to the middle 1990s to be able to buy gold at $510 an ounce.
[01:04:10.212 --> 01:04:11.272]  That's just a steal.
[01:04:11.312 --> 01:04:12.513]  You mean the middle 2000s?
[01:04:13.034 --> 01:04:14.575]  I'm sorry, yeah, the middle 2000s.
[01:04:14.695 --> 01:04:15.375]  Time flies.
[01:04:15.475 --> 01:04:19.138]  And then expanding on that, what if folks don't just want one franc, and that's the best deal ever?
[01:04:19.418 --> 01:04:21.479]  You've got great deals on a lot of other coins.
[01:04:21.699 --> 01:04:22.420]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:24.221]  We've got the British Sovereign currently right now at $318.
[01:04:26.551 --> 01:04:26.851]  U.S.
[01:04:26.931 --> 01:04:29.573]  Eagles right now are trading over $1,200 an ounce.
[01:04:30.073 --> 01:04:34.695]  I have old $20 Liberties that I picked up when gold was at $1,050, and I'm selling those right now for $1,362.
[01:04:34.955 --> 01:04:35.716]  That's about a $100 premium over a U.S.
[01:04:35.736 --> 01:04:36.356]  Eagle, which is unheard of.

[01:05:13.343 --> 01:05:16.526]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:05:16.906 --> 01:05:18.747]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:05:19.188 --> 01:05:19.608]  Don't!
[01:05:20.068 --> 01:05:23.091]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[01:06:09.653 --> 01:06:14.856]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:06:15.036 --> 01:06:20.379]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:06:20.559 --> 01:06:20.999]  I get it.
[01:06:21.099 --> 01:06:30.424]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:06:30.724 --> 01:06:31.885]  That's not what's happening.
[01:06:32.125 --> 01:06:40.393]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:06:40.593 --> 01:06:43.876]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:06:43.996 --> 01:06:48.079]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:49.841]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:06:49.861 --> 01:06:53.104]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[01:06:53.825 --> 01:06:57.428]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:06:57.628 --> 01:06:58.329]  You should, too.
[01:06:58.529 --> 01:06:59.510]  Find out what they know.
[01:06:59.670 --> 01:07:03.033]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[01:07:03.053 --> 01:07:03.093]  800-686-2237.
[01:07:03.113 --> 01:07:03.173]  800-686-2237.
[01:07:03.253 --> 01:07:03.513]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:07:03.534 --> 01:07:06.116]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:07:06.136 --> 01:07:07.597]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:07:07.617 --> 01:07:08.538]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:07:24.248 --> 01:07:26.709]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:07:26.729 --> 01:07:32.932]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:07:33.112 --> 01:07:38.154]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:07:38.174 --> 01:07:48.279]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:07:48.419 --> 01:07:50.521]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:07:50.761 --> 01:07:52.102]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:07:52.342 --> 01:07:54.624]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:07:54.805 --> 01:07:56.646]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:07:56.666 --> 01:08:01.771]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:08:02.091 --> 01:08:06.875]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:08:22.226 --> 01:08:24.047]  The world is changing fast.
[01:08:24.447 --> 01:08:25.908]  Are you fully prepared?
[01:08:26.688 --> 01:08:29.350]  Or will you be forced to eat government soup?
[01:08:29.890 --> 01:08:40.156]  At PatriotFood.com, we offer you 135 pounds of dehydrated food and six varieties of canned meat for half price.

[01:08:56.810 --> 01:09:01.134]  Patriotfood.com and survivalistseeds.com.
[01:09:01.414 --> 01:09:03.776]  Food insurance, just in case.
[01:09:04.357 --> 01:09:09.001]  Owned by me, Vic John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[01:09:20.279 --> 01:09:23.569]  Coming up, selling airsoft replicas.
[01:09:23.609 --> 01:09:27.881]  Yeah, they look like real guns, but they shoot little plastic pellets.
[01:09:30.225 --> 01:09:33.027]  Man, ATF just grabs them.
[01:09:33.808 --> 01:09:35.429]  That is coming up in the next segment.
[01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:41.274]  Then we're going to have open phones and news blitz, talk about the Texas election, everything in the last hour today.
[01:09:41.915 --> 01:09:45.297]  We got Herman, Bob, Hitler, Scott, Toby and others.
[01:09:45.838 --> 01:09:47.039]  Hitler in Hawaii.
[01:09:47.579 --> 01:09:49.801]  Why are you calling yourself Hitler?
[01:09:50.302 --> 01:09:52.523]  That's an interesting... Is that your real name?
[01:09:53.744 --> 01:09:55.486]  No sir, that's not my real name.
[01:09:55.566 --> 01:09:56.767]  I've called it a few times.
[01:09:56.787 --> 01:09:58.128]  I called it Mark Twain once.
[01:09:58.208 --> 01:09:59.229]  I called him to Hitler.
[01:09:59.781 --> 01:10:04.044]  Because I actually kind of look like him when I go out to do my protests.
[01:10:04.624 --> 01:10:06.945]  I do a little hip stache and it's on my YouTube.
[01:10:06.965 --> 01:10:07.806]  It's funny stuff.
[01:10:08.026 --> 01:10:08.446]  What do you do?
[01:10:09.647 --> 01:10:14.470]  Do you go out and support the government and say I like warrantless wiretapping and then you're Hitler?
[01:10:16.351 --> 01:10:23.896]  I go out in a shock value look to promote if he can act like Hitler, I can look like Hitler.
[01:10:24.096 --> 01:10:26.517]  Routine.
[01:10:26.537 --> 01:10:28.759]  Oh, if who can act like Hitler?
[01:10:29.682 --> 01:10:31.363]  It's the current president.
[01:10:31.603 --> 01:10:32.464]  What's your website?
[01:10:32.504 --> 01:10:33.465]  I mean, what's your YouTube?
[01:10:33.505 --> 01:10:34.906]  I want to see this right now.
[01:10:34.926 --> 01:10:35.847]  Let's pull it up.
[01:10:36.027 --> 01:10:38.148]  It's Gerd Chappell's channel.
[01:10:39.409 --> 01:10:42.792]  G-E-R-D-C-H-A-P-P-L-E.
[01:10:43.412 --> 01:10:45.293]  Give me a name of one of your Hitler videos.
[01:10:46.514 --> 01:10:49.797]  Let's see, a good... Hitler hits the fair.
[01:10:50.984 --> 01:10:52.244]  Hitler hits the fair.
[01:10:54.165 --> 01:11:04.727]  Because that would be a great way to illustrate a lot of people are now protesting with bullhorns going, I love naked body scanners, I love the New World Order, I love being surveilled, I love the banks taking all my money.
[01:11:05.187 --> 01:11:09.728]  And it's having a really powerful effect on crowds and they're handing out Obama deceptions or other things.
[01:11:10.248 --> 01:11:20.310]  And I've seen some protest videos of people coming out dressed like Hitler, it may have even been you, pushing tyranny as a way to kind of shock people into realizing
[01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:24.273]  You know, the tyranny doesn't always look like Hitler, but it sure acts like Hitler.
[01:11:24.813 --> 01:11:26.234]  I mean, is that what you do?
[01:11:27.995 --> 01:11:36.422]  No, I'd like to first thank you for saving my life, because a year ago, I would be just sitting in the couch, drinking myself to sleep, because I've been unemployed for over a year.
[01:11:36.682 --> 01:11:38.003]  And now you're dressed up like Hitler!
[01:11:38.023 --> 01:11:45.449]  Yeah, and now one of the 70% of the unemployed carpenters turn political activist, and I haven't had so much fun in my life.
[01:11:47.321 --> 01:11:48.782]  So what's on your mind today, Hitler?
[01:12:04.433 --> 01:12:08.615]  Well listen, Hitler, send us the info and we're going to look up your videos, okay?
[01:12:08.855 --> 01:12:09.835]  Hitler hits the fair.
[01:12:10.655 --> 01:12:11.315]  Did we find one?
[01:12:11.335 --> 01:12:13.756]  Alright, if you really did this, send it to me.
[01:12:14.457 --> 01:12:17.137]  But it is a good idea, a way to illustrate tyranny.
[01:12:17.438 --> 01:12:23.119]  Like have a bunch of people dressed up like Hitler and say you're for the body scanners and you're for more preemptive wars.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.420]  Let's talk to Herman in New York.
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:26.301]  Herman, you're on the air.
[01:12:28.661 --> 01:12:29.782]  Yes, hello Alex, can you hear me?
[01:12:30.202 --> 01:12:30.542]  Yes, sir.
[01:12:32.134 --> 01:12:33.995]  Yes, I have two questions.
[01:12:34.295 --> 01:12:44.218]  My first question is, I've often heard you and Webster Tartley say that we need to build bridges, roads, high technology, trains, etc.
[01:12:44.639 --> 01:12:47.840]  Now, how does infrastructure create wealth?
[01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:51.421]  Because you guys often said, you know, if we had great infrastructure, we'd all be
[01:12:52.168 --> 01:12:52.748]  You know, wealthy.
[01:12:53.429 --> 01:13:04.353]  Well, Carpley's saying that if you have an imploded economy, you have to build infrastructure first instead of just giving all the money to banks that move offshore or use it to buy up, control your local government.
[01:13:04.893 --> 01:13:08.715]  The American infrastructure in the 50s was the best in the world.
[01:13:08.835 --> 01:13:10.776]  Since then, it's been rotting.
[01:13:11.636 --> 01:13:20.538]  And so you don't get corporations investing, you don't, you know, when they build a new road, you get new housing projects, you get new malls being built, new factories.
[01:13:20.558 --> 01:13:23.579]  I mean, it just goes to basic economics.
[01:13:23.739 --> 01:13:39.423]  And if you have government spending, and I'm not even for big government, but if you're going to have it, the spending needs to be then on infrastructure, because then you hire local people when they build the infrastructure, so most of the tax money
[01:13:40.203 --> 01:13:48.290]  And if there's a competitive bidding process goes back into the population and it has a dynamo effect.
[01:13:48.991 --> 01:13:50.712]  And, I mean, what's your take on that?
[01:13:52.294 --> 01:13:54.255]  I definitely, I understand what you're saying now.
[01:13:54.896 --> 01:14:02.542]  And my second question is, I know that I watched an old YouTube video of you where you said how, you know, the government has two sets of books.
[01:14:02.603 --> 01:14:04.304]  I believe it's the CAFRs.
[01:14:05.065 --> 01:14:07.447]  Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports Exposed, yes.
[01:14:08.476 --> 01:14:08.976]  Absolutely.
[01:14:09.536 --> 01:14:15.679]  And I want to know, how would they allow the states to just collapse while they have that money sitting on the side?
[01:14:15.719 --> 01:14:16.319]  How could they do that?
[01:14:16.599 --> 01:14:19.400]  Well, what they do is they go in and take over the cities and counties.
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:22.121]  The mafia did it in the 30s, 40s, and 50s in Chicago.
[01:14:22.581 --> 01:14:25.622]  In the late 40s, early 50s, they took the 1313 Chicago model.
[01:14:27.523 --> 01:14:27.743]  I think?
[01:14:46.673 --> 01:14:49.456]  Bankrupt us to the point of Nigeria or Argentina.
[01:14:50.076 --> 01:14:51.378]  And so that's how the scam works.
[01:14:51.678 --> 01:14:52.559]  We'll be right back.
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:55.142]  Don't forget that gold deal Ted offered.
[01:14:55.202 --> 01:14:55.982]  It's off the charts.

[01:17:12.967 --> 01:17:18.371]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:17:19.612 --> 01:17:24.376]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:17:24.757 --> 01:17:31.542]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:17:33.484 --> 01:17:35.625]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:17:37.547 --> 01:17:39.509]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:17:41.826 --> 01:17:45.869]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:17:46.569 --> 01:17:49.712]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[01:17:50.392 --> 01:17:51.213]  Others don't.
[01:17:51.633 --> 01:17:53.514]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:17:53.774 --> 01:17:55.275]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:17:55.556 --> 01:17:58.117]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:17:58.438 --> 01:18:04.702]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.

[01:18:10.146 --> 01:18:11.007]  Others don't.
[01:18:17.243 --> 01:18:19.584]  I just heard an ad for Gusset Jeans.
[01:18:19.644 --> 01:18:23.986]  We've got links to it up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:18:25.406 --> 01:18:26.646]  These are awesome jeans.
[01:18:27.487 --> 01:18:28.727]  I've got several pairs.
[01:18:28.747 --> 01:18:30.888]  I'm going to start wearing these exclusively.
[01:18:30.928 --> 01:18:34.929]  They fit just like Levi's, last longer, and they're made in America.
[01:18:35.469 --> 01:18:39.891]  So check out their website up on InfoWars.com or just Google Gusset Jeans.
[01:18:42.292 --> 01:18:42.592]  Okay.
[01:18:44.528 --> 01:18:49.551]  I saw this late last week, and it really upset me.
[01:18:50.112 --> 01:18:52.473]  Because sure, they look like real guns.
[01:18:52.493 --> 01:19:00.038]  You can buy an M16, you can buy something that looks like an AK-47, you can buy stuff that looks like a Beretta handgun.
[01:19:01.198 --> 01:19:02.819]  They shoot little plastic pellets.
[01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:04.861]  So they're not even BB guns.
[01:19:05.831 --> 01:19:08.693]  It's a little bit bigger pellet than a BB, about, I guess, three times the size.
[01:19:09.193 --> 01:19:17.379]  I've bought quite a few of these guns to train my five-year-old daughter and seven-year-old son on marksmanship in the backyard.
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:32.310]  And the ATF in Cornelius, Oregon, went in to one of the local dealers of Airsoft plastic pellet guns, that they have no statutory authority, nothing, went in
[01:19:33.666 --> 01:19:44.319]  took the guns from customs it turns out customs called them the toy guns and are now claiming that they can just basically outside of law
[01:19:46.118 --> 01:19:47.479]  Rule what is a firearm.
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:20:04.015]  And we see cases where somebody's got an AR-15 that they bought legal, it has a malfunction, fires two or three rounds, the shooting range calls the police on them, and in federal court they say it doesn't matter, even if you didn't know and it was a legal gun,
[01:20:05.086 --> 01:20:05.986]  You're going to prison.
[01:20:06.627 --> 01:20:08.787]  So the ATF is harassing lawful gun owners.
[01:20:09.368 --> 01:20:12.729]  Now, they're raiding people every day I see in the news.
[01:20:13.109 --> 01:20:15.590]  Neighbors will see somebody with a rifle put in their car at their house.
[01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:19.251]  The police come, they find five guns, a thousand rounds of ammo.
[01:20:19.751 --> 01:20:21.252]  There's no law against an arsenal.
[01:20:21.612 --> 01:20:22.692]  They call it an arsenal.
[01:20:22.753 --> 01:20:24.393]  They take your guns, arrest you.
[01:20:25.874 --> 01:20:26.514]  Without a law!
[01:20:28.087 --> 01:20:44.342]  And so we're joined by Brad Martin of Airsoft and we'll give you his website here specifically from Oregon, but he and his son run this toy store and these are sold in Walmart, these are sold in Academy, these are sold most
[01:20:45.203 --> 01:20:47.344]  Hardware stores, hunting supply stores.
[01:20:48.045 --> 01:20:49.146]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:20:49.266 --> 01:20:55.250]  And for them to say you can cartridge and could build a real gun out of this because it looks like a gun.
[01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:57.591]  I mean, it's asinine.
[01:20:57.611 --> 01:21:03.515]  I mean, yeah, if you spent two or three times the money it takes to make, I mean, to buy a real gun, maybe you could, it'd blow up in your face.
[01:21:04.055 --> 01:21:10.500]  So he joins us to talk about all the different facets and angles of this and how this is just being
[01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:16.163]  Selectively enforced, and even the selective enforcement is just made up.
[01:21:16.243 --> 01:21:21.966]  And if this is allowed to stand, it sets an incredibly dangerous precedent.
[01:21:22.306 --> 01:21:29.110]  Because if they can ban BB guns that shoot plastic BBs, what's going to happen to the deadly Red Rider?
[01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:31.211]  Will it be banned as an assault weapon?
[01:21:31.891 --> 01:21:33.952]  So, we now speak to our guest, Brad Martin.
[01:21:33.972 --> 01:21:37.194]  Brad, break down exactly what happened and all the latest developments for us.
[01:21:38.012 --> 01:21:38.992]  Well, hi there, Mr. Jones.
[01:21:39.653 --> 01:21:42.394]  Yeah, this started back in October of 2009.
[01:21:43.414 --> 01:21:51.137]  We import airsoft toy guns and airsoft equipment to go along with those.
[01:21:51.157 --> 01:21:59.539]  And over the last five or six years, we've had several interventions from customs where they've taken, in the vicinity of about $17,000 worth of product from us,
[01:22:02.012 --> 01:22:05.594]  And you know, I haven't really made a big issue out of it.
[01:22:05.634 --> 01:22:10.036]  We just took our licks and kept on, kept on, kept on, keeping on, sort of.
[01:22:10.576 --> 01:22:20.001]  But bottom line is, this most recent seizure in October was of 30 gas-powered M4 lookalikes.
[01:22:23.732 --> 01:22:28.014]  And these pieces are 100% legitimate.
[01:22:28.034 --> 01:22:34.836]  They're designed to fire these quarter-inch plastic BBs, as you described, and that's their function.
[01:22:35.397 --> 01:22:46.541]  Well, when Customs received these, one or two of their agents looked at them and decided that it was above their pay grade to make a call on these things.
[01:22:47.081 --> 01:22:49.402]  So they called in the ATF to look at them.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:23:10.899]  So, ATF took one or more of these things back to their laboratory in Maryland, or wherever this thing is, held them for five months, and then in early February, after I had mailed some protest letters to the ATF and Customs, I finally get a response back saying that I was not going to get these toy guns back.
[01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:14.002]  And they quoted a code.
[01:23:16.221 --> 01:23:17.062]  Because they look like
[01:23:45.521 --> 01:24:02.963]  Yeah, the other day the Port Director from Customs in Seattle called all the local TV affiliates in and gave this news conference on air holding one of our guns and
[01:24:03.784 --> 01:24:09.808]  And saying that this is a threat to the safety of America, and he labeled them as machine guns.
[01:24:10.348 --> 01:24:22.056]  And while he was talking and handling this gun of ours, this toy of ours, he was trying to stick the magazine into the mag well, and he had the magazine turn around backwards.
[01:24:22.096 --> 01:24:26.499]  He didn't even know which way the bloody magazine came into the mag well.
[01:24:26.519 --> 01:24:28.820]  We're going to play a clip of this coming up.
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:31.642]  You've got the ATF agent putting on this big
[01:24:33.083 --> 01:24:42.633]  Hullabaloo, trying to scare everybody to set the precedent to ban something that isn't even a BB gun because it looks scary to them.
[01:24:43.213 --> 01:24:46.597]  My God, if this is allowed to stand, this is an incredible new precedent.
[01:24:47.341 --> 01:24:47.981]  Well, it is.
[01:24:48.401 --> 01:24:49.142]  It is scary.
[01:24:49.262 --> 01:24:56.985]  You know, and this is a David and Goliath scenario where, you know, I could bankrupt myself fighting the federal government and still end up a loser here.
[01:24:57.485 --> 01:25:03.047]  But, you know, it's time for us to stir up the pot a little bit and kind of try to put the brakes on this behavior.
[01:25:05.988 --> 01:25:13.191]  We're going to play this video that's up on your website for ThePrisonPlanet.tv viewers and radio listeners.
[01:25:13.571 --> 01:25:16.532]  Give us your web address for folks that want to follow this case.
[01:25:17.295 --> 01:25:17.895]  Okay, sure.
[01:25:18.295 --> 01:25:23.996]  The web address is airsoftoutletnw.com.
[01:25:25.597 --> 01:25:29.958]  So, airsoftoutletnorthwest.com, just N-W.
[01:25:30.418 --> 01:25:32.898]  Yeah, just N-W, not the Northwest, just N-W.
[01:25:33.798 --> 01:25:45.361]  Alright, we're going to play one of the myriad of newscasts trying to create a panic over the devilish plastic BB gun that is so scary looking.
[01:25:45.801 --> 01:25:46.261]  Here it is.
[01:25:47.552 --> 01:25:48.973]  And welcome everyone and good evening.
[01:25:49.033 --> 01:25:49.954]  I'm Jeff Giannola.
[01:25:50.014 --> 01:25:50.875]  And I'm Kelly Day.
[01:25:51.055 --> 01:25:55.398]  Federal agents seized a ship of toy guns they say in the wrong hands.
[01:25:55.798 --> 01:25:57.079]  They could have actually been deadly.
[01:25:57.219 --> 01:26:02.343]  In this COIN LOCAL 6 exclusive, our reporter Alexis Stills said talk to the local businessman who
[01:26:05.326 --> 01:26:07.849]  Jeff, this is an example of one of the toy guns seized.
[01:26:07.889 --> 01:26:10.011]  And besides the orange chip, it looks pretty real.
[01:26:10.392 --> 01:26:11.793]  But this is an airsoft toy.
[01:26:11.813 --> 01:26:13.094]  It shoots plastic BBs.
[01:26:13.555 --> 01:26:18.741]  And the man who ordered these says anyone with any knowledge of weapons should be able to figure that out.
[01:26:22.518 --> 01:26:24.360]  No bullets, just plastic BBs.
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:27.823]  Not a battlefield, just a wooded area made to look like one.
[01:26:27.843 --> 01:26:29.404]  It's another version of paintball.
[01:26:29.544 --> 01:26:39.713]  For the past seven years, Brad Martin and his son Ben say their family business in Cornelius has steadily grown as simulated combat gaming grows in popularity across the country.
[01:26:39.793 --> 01:26:43.376]  This is the contemporary version of Civil War reenacting.
[01:26:43.536 --> 01:26:54.809]  While they aim for authenticity in every piece of gear, the Martins didn't anticipate a seizure by customs and ATF agents in Tacoma as their latest shipment of toy guns arrived from Taiwan.
[01:26:54.909 --> 01:26:59.974]  Any kid, any parent, any adult going out of the house with this.
[01:27:02.935 --> 01:27:03.895]  Needs to be ready for trouble.
[01:27:04.176 --> 01:27:18.021]  ATF Special Agent Calvin Crenshaw says not only is the shipment missing the orange tips required on all imported toy guns... With minimal work, it could be converted to a machine gun.
[01:27:18.141 --> 01:27:21.623]  To say these are readily convertible to machine guns is absolutely preposterous.
[01:27:21.683 --> 01:27:27.465]  The round wouldn't go into the barrel for one, and two, if the firing pin did strike the primer, the gun would basically blow up in your face.
[01:27:27.685 --> 01:27:32.849]  Also, the Martins say there are tens of thousands of replicas just like these sold in America already.
[01:27:33.210 --> 01:27:36.092]  The only reason they buy from Taiwan is because it's cheaper.
[01:27:36.572 --> 01:27:37.213]  Until now.
[01:27:37.533 --> 01:27:49.302]  He spent all this manpower, tax dollars, and time, and wasted my time, my money, my profitability, to seize 30 toy guns.
[01:27:49.703 --> 01:27:50.443]  That's what he's done.
[01:27:50.824 --> 01:27:53.486]  And he's portrayed himself as a great hero.
[01:27:54.927 --> 01:28:01.530]  But ATF insists that it did the testing and determined that, yes, these can be converted into military-grade weapons.
[01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:08.372]  The Martins requested to see the documentation of that, and they were told that they'd have to file a Freedom of Information request with ATF.
[01:28:08.412 --> 01:28:10.653]  Now, as for the orange tips, this one has one.
[01:28:10.693 --> 01:28:13.054]  The ones that came in from Taiwan didn't.
[01:28:13.134 --> 01:28:19.577]  But the Martins say that's happened before with their shipments from Taiwan, and they just had to go up to Tacoma and paint the tips orange themselves.
[01:28:19.617 --> 01:28:22.298]  So they wonder why this is being made into an issue now.
[01:28:23.679 --> 01:28:28.322]  Okay, and we have Brad Martin online with us.
[01:28:28.402 --> 01:28:35.028]  So, you've got an ATF officer in a fancy suit who can't even put the cartridge in it.
[01:28:35.308 --> 01:28:36.489]  He can't put the magazine in it.
[01:28:36.509 --> 01:28:42.074]  It shoots little bitty round plastic BBs that look like they're even smaller than .22 caliber.
[01:28:42.094 --> 01:28:44.435]  There's no room for a cartridge to go in.
[01:28:44.475 --> 01:28:45.977]  There's no room for propellant.
[01:28:46.457 --> 01:28:54.460]  Now he uses air to shoot plastic BBs and what's really happening, I saw this five years ago or so in England, where they're trying to ban these over there.
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:59.742]  They don't like the gun culture growing because this is a gateway to real firearms.
[01:29:00.022 --> 01:29:07.324]  People are finding out how much fun it is to target shoot or to dress up in gear and you know go to the equivalent of paintball ranges.
[01:29:08.965 --> 01:29:23.088]  You know, run around with my children, you know, in the backyard and shoot targets and shoot tin cans, and you learn how to be a good marksman, then they graduate to BB guns, then they graduate to real firearms, and to... This is incredible.
[01:29:23.188 --> 01:29:24.189]  This is lawlessness.
[01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:29.010]  And you told me off-air that you've talked to other ATF branches, and they're like, we can't believe this happened.
[01:29:29.690 --> 01:29:30.890]  These aren't real firearms.
[01:29:30.930 --> 01:29:34.391]  We don't have a statutory authority.
[01:29:34.791 --> 01:29:35.711]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:29:35.752 --> 01:29:36.692]  They're in your area.
[01:29:36.992 --> 01:29:39.433]  They're just going to do whatever they want.
[01:29:39.993 --> 01:29:42.014]  And I guess if they don't have a law, they don't care.
[01:29:42.034 --> 01:29:46.016]  Because he says, you go outside with this, you're looking for trouble.
[01:29:46.116 --> 01:29:48.977]  He feels like you shouldn't have this as a slave.
[01:29:49.297 --> 01:29:50.658]  And so he's going to take them.
[01:29:51.138 --> 01:29:51.718]  That's the end of it.
[01:29:51.738 --> 01:29:53.539]  It doesn't matter if it's a $30,000 shipment.
[01:29:53.559 --> 01:29:54.319]  It doesn't matter.
[01:29:54.679 --> 01:29:55.940]  Because they run this country now.
[01:29:57.392 --> 01:29:58.573]  Yep, that's exactly right.
[01:30:00.395 --> 01:30:05.199]  After about three months of this seizure going on, I started writing letters and calling people.
[01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:16.049]  I talked to an agent back in Maryland, I believe it was, who was in the ATF Division of Firearms Importations.
[01:30:16.716 --> 01:30:22.397]  And I explained the situation to her, and she said, well, why did ATF take Airsoft?
[01:30:22.417 --> 01:30:24.698]  And I said, well, I guess because they can.
[01:30:25.178 --> 01:30:43.042]  And she said, well, ATF has no jurisdiction over Airsoft, and if you would like to, if you would give my telephone number, meaning her telephone number, to the local ATF people and tell them to call her, she would inform them that they have no jurisdiction over Airsoft.
[01:30:46.231 --> 01:30:47.972]  Oh, that didn't dissuade them.
[01:30:49.692 --> 01:30:58.295]  So explain, who you separately talked to at ATF, who was, what her position is, and then what they said, because we want to write an article about this.
[01:30:58.975 --> 01:31:07.758]  Yeah, well exactly, and I can provide you with a phone number at some future, I don't have it with me right here, but as I mentioned, after going through
[01:31:08.769 --> 01:31:21.418]  After calling the ATF back east and explaining my situation to about four or five people, I finally got to this agent in, as I mentioned, the Division of Firearms Importation.
[01:31:22.318 --> 01:31:24.720]  And I explained it to her, and she said,
[01:31:25.367 --> 01:31:28.969]  We have no jurisdiction over Airsoft.
[01:31:29.730 --> 01:31:33.532]  The ATF controls by ruling.
[01:31:33.832 --> 01:31:34.773]  That's what they do.
[01:31:34.813 --> 01:31:37.415]  They see something and they don't need a law about it.
[01:31:37.755 --> 01:31:38.996]  They just make a ruling.
[01:31:43.118 --> 01:31:43.278]  Yeah.
[01:31:43.558 --> 01:31:45.219]  This is a commerce issue.
[01:31:45.359 --> 01:31:46.400]  You've been robbed.
[01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:59.388]  When an officer, federal or state, operates clearly outside their jurisdiction, consciously, through color of law, you have been physically robbed and so you file a criminal police report that you've been robbed.
[01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:06.364]  Well, in essence, I wrote to them and I said, you know, what's happening with this shipment?
[01:32:06.404 --> 01:32:08.586]  Why am I getting no information about this?
[01:32:08.626 --> 01:32:11.728]  Because they're incredibly secretive.
[01:32:11.988 --> 01:32:13.469]  They don't give you any information.
[01:32:13.489 --> 01:32:18.533]  No judge, no jury, no indictment, no interview, no arrest, no paperwork.
[01:32:18.753 --> 01:32:22.116]  Just your 30,000 of toy guns is gone, pal.
[01:32:22.376 --> 01:32:25.058]  We don't need no stinking warrants or paperwork.
[01:32:25.518 --> 01:32:26.699]  We rule America.
[01:32:26.899 --> 01:32:29.001]  You don't sell toy guns around here, boy.
[01:32:30.291 --> 01:32:31.332]  Absolutely, that's right.
[01:32:31.372 --> 01:32:37.878]  And I figured that if they really thought my guns were machine guns like they said they were, I'd be in handcuffs by now.
[01:32:38.839 --> 01:32:40.521]  But they're not down here arresting me.
[01:32:41.341 --> 01:32:44.865]  And they're not in other vendors.
[01:32:46.062 --> 01:32:53.605]  This is sold at Walmart, Academy, everywhere the exact same fake M16 plastic toy guns.
[01:32:54.085 --> 01:33:04.130]  People are running around with these having a great time and it's buoying the gun culture and I think this is an ATF case on purpose from the Obama administration.
[01:33:04.150 --> 01:33:14.194]  We confirmed in Austin they shut down a gun show with no law to set a national precedent and I believe they picked you as a small independent dealer to set the precedent.
[01:33:15.345 --> 01:33:16.405]  It wouldn't surprise me at all.
[01:33:16.605 --> 01:33:17.466]  Yes, sir, I agree with you.
[01:33:19.006 --> 01:33:35.710]  Well, give out your website again for Legal Eagles, lawyers on the West Coast, other people that want to bring civil rights suits, commerce suits, robbery suits, criminal charges, because we have a lot of experts out there that are listening that would want to email you advice.
[01:33:36.490 --> 01:33:38.010]  Yeah, nothing would please me more.
[01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:44.532]  My website is www.airsoftoutletnw.com.
[01:33:45.239 --> 01:33:55.029]  Now, tell people, Brad Martin, when this first happened and any new developments because, you know, we're quite a few days into this and I guess they say, look, talk to the hand.
[01:33:55.449 --> 01:33:58.833]  You don't get paperwork, you don't get anything, we just rob you.
[01:34:00.143 --> 01:34:02.183]  Well, that's basically it.
[01:34:02.263 --> 01:34:11.225]  Now, I spoke to an ATF agent up in Tacoma a week or ten days ago, and this guy had his head screwed on straight.
[01:34:11.365 --> 01:34:24.307]  I think there are some really good agents in the company, basically, but the anti-gun influence is so strong that I think these sensible guys get shouted down.
[01:34:24.767 --> 01:34:29.188]  But I was talking to him, and he said that basically
[01:34:30.020 --> 01:34:36.562]  Customs has me on a hit list now, but anytime one of my orders hits port, they're going to flag my order.
[01:34:36.582 --> 01:34:39.123]  They're going to take it for intensive examination.
[01:34:39.183 --> 01:34:45.005]  And right now, they have two more of my orders backed up in port for intensive examination.
[01:34:45.025 --> 01:34:45.185]  Whoa!
[01:34:45.205 --> 01:34:46.926]  They're going to put you out of business.
[01:34:46.946 --> 01:34:50.807]  They got a $30,000 order and just grabbed it with the ATF.
[01:34:51.188 --> 01:34:52.168]  What have they gotten now?
[01:34:52.907 --> 01:34:55.308]  Oh, they've got about another 20,000 in there now.
[01:34:55.568 --> 01:34:57.189]  Yeah.
[01:34:58.030 --> 01:34:58.930]  Unbelievable.
[01:34:58.950 --> 01:35:06.094]  Well, people need to all over the country order the guns you've got in stock, the plastic toy pellet guns, just to keep you afloat.
[01:35:06.174 --> 01:35:08.035]  Because that's one thing I noticed the feds will do.
[01:35:08.275 --> 01:35:13.178]  They'll just ruin you to set the precedent, pick a little guy, and then hope you just go away.
[01:35:14.178 --> 01:35:15.579]  Yeah, well, we're not going to go away.
[01:35:15.599 --> 01:35:18.601]  You know, you piss off a Scotsman and they're going to fight back.
[01:35:18.681 --> 01:35:21.282]  So I'm kind of fed up with their behavior.
[01:35:23.397 --> 01:35:31.915]  I don't know if I can generate enough income to take the feds to court or not, but I'm going to look at that and I don't know if the NRA or other gun groups could.
[01:35:36.848 --> 01:35:40.310]  We've got Larry Pratt on, what is it, is Pratt on Thursday?
[01:35:41.211 --> 01:35:42.652]  Head of Gun Owners of America.
[01:35:42.692 --> 01:35:49.857]  We're going to get, believe me, Jews for Preservation of Firearms or the Gun Owners of America is going to want to help you.
[01:35:49.897 --> 01:35:57.182]  We've got the ATF red-handed here in lawlessness, color of law, Shanghai-ing, free-booting.
[01:35:58.843 --> 01:36:00.805]  This is the same as just robbing a stagecoach.
[01:36:00.845 --> 01:36:01.926]  I mean, they are bandits.
[01:36:02.566 --> 01:36:17.596]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[01:36:17.816 --> 01:36:25.861]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[01:36:26.001 --> 01:36:29.804]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster
[01:36:30.284 --> 01:36:43.891]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:36:44.051 --> 01:36:48.453]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:36:48.613 --> 01:36:54.336]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[01:36:54.416 --> 01:36:57.758]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:36:58.058 --> 01:37:00.659]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:37:00.879 --> 01:37:05.681]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:37:05.821 --> 01:37:06.581]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:37:08.682 --> 01:37:10.643]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:37:14.364 --> 01:37:17.986]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:37:18.366 --> 01:37:21.387]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:37:21.627 --> 01:37:23.028]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:37:23.926 --> 01:37:26.387]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:37:26.407 --> 01:37:32.608]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:37:32.788 --> 01:37:37.809]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:37:37.829 --> 01:37:47.972]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:37:48.092 --> 01:37:50.193]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:37:50.434 --> 01:37:51.754]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:37:52.014 --> 01:37:54.296]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:37:54.476 --> 01:37:56.317]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:37:56.337 --> 01:38:01.420]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:38:13.334 --> 01:38:23.945]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[01:38:24.245 --> 01:38:28.169]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[01:38:28.429 --> 01:38:30.251]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[01:38:30.571 --> 01:38:36.037]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[01:38:36.237 --> 01:38:45.961]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[01:38:46.221 --> 01:38:52.483]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[01:38:52.703 --> 01:38:56.004]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[01:38:56.024 --> 01:38:57.885]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[01:38:58.125 --> 01:39:01.226]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[01:39:01.266 --> 01:39:03.367]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:27.871]  Freedom defenders.
[01:39:28.431 --> 01:39:29.672]  Folks like this gentleman.
[01:39:29.752 --> 01:39:30.353]  Gun shows.
[01:39:30.413 --> 01:39:32.614]  We're here defending, defending, defending.
[01:39:33.074 --> 01:39:34.715]  Lobbying for liberty and freedom.
[01:39:35.836 --> 01:39:40.079]  Rallying people to support the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[01:39:40.579 --> 01:39:42.961]  That's why it's important to support InfoWars.com.

[01:40:22.101 --> 01:40:27.743]  Going back to this gentleman, Brad Martin, I mean, this is like more than Orwellian.
[01:40:27.823 --> 01:40:29.404]  It's surreal, like a comedy.
[01:40:29.684 --> 01:40:34.847]  The news, holding up a gun with a red tip, a little toy plastic machine gun.
[01:40:35.387 --> 01:40:42.429]  Saying, oh my gosh, it's so scary, and an ATF guy, we'll put his picture up there, you know, looking like he's in deep fear over all this.
[01:40:42.829 --> 01:40:45.430]  I mean, if they can get toy guns, nothing's safe.
[01:40:47.291 --> 01:40:48.091]  It's true, the truth.
[01:40:48.171 --> 01:41:03.016]  You know, I was talking, I went over to the local coffee shop for a cup this morning, and the police chief from our town was in there, and off the record, not as police chief, but he's 100% behind us on this.
[01:41:04.190 --> 01:41:15.895]  And he and I were talking, and he was saying that Americans are afraid of everything, and the government wants to protect us from everything that's even a little bit scary.
[01:41:15.935 --> 01:41:17.716]  And basically, that's what's happening here.
[01:41:17.736 --> 01:41:23.778]  You know, this creeping totalitarianism of the government wanting to have their fingers and control everything.
[01:41:24.278 --> 01:41:27.159]  And it's just got to stop somewhere.
[01:41:27.199 --> 01:41:28.660]  I don't know where it stops, but we got to
[01:41:29.488 --> 01:41:31.370]  Well, look at this ATF officer.
[01:41:31.691 --> 01:41:32.251]  What is his name?
[01:41:32.332 --> 01:41:32.812]  Clevin?
[01:41:33.453 --> 01:41:34.514]  Throw him back up on the screen.
[01:41:34.795 --> 01:41:35.916]  Clevin Crenshaw.
[01:41:36.236 --> 01:41:37.538]  I mean, he's in what looks like a $2,000 suit.
[01:41:37.798 --> 01:41:38.559]  Taxpayer paid for.
[01:41:41.363 --> 01:41:43.064]  That's a beautiful suit he's wearing.
[01:41:43.125 --> 01:41:43.965]  I gotta say that.
[01:41:44.526 --> 01:41:46.407]  I mean this is a stunt for him.
[01:41:46.427 --> 01:41:48.169]  A stunt from the ATF.
[01:41:48.209 --> 01:41:49.950]  Guaranteed Obama's pushing this.
[01:41:50.451 --> 01:41:53.493]  And he's here trampling on your right to commerce.
[01:41:54.975 --> 01:42:00.419]  They've now got $50,000 of your toy guns and they just think you're not even human.
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:04.683]  I mean, doing this to you, it's like you don't even exist.
[01:42:05.484 --> 01:42:06.224]  That's so true.
[01:42:06.264 --> 01:42:07.886]  You know, it's like, since when
[01:42:09.045 --> 01:42:10.026]  But by the way!
[01:42:31.243 --> 01:42:32.344]  I own some of these.
[01:42:32.364 --> 01:42:41.210]  I mean, it converts something that's air powered and doesn't even have the mechanism to put in a cartridge that has powder that projects it.
[01:42:41.250 --> 01:42:42.391]  I mean, this is asinine.
[01:42:42.811 --> 01:42:43.251]  It is.
[01:42:43.751 --> 01:42:50.076]  I mean, sure, if you went to a top machinist, maybe they could build something that would chamber around, but then this is tin metal.
[01:42:50.096 --> 01:42:50.856]  It would blow up.
[01:42:51.777 --> 01:42:53.978]  Well, that's our point, too.
[01:42:54.658 --> 01:42:58.921]  And if a guy wanted an AR-15 or an M4,
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:01.961]  We're good to go.
[01:43:15.456 --> 01:43:16.197]  I think you're right.
[01:43:16.217 --> 01:43:17.098]  I think they're scared.
[01:43:17.218 --> 01:43:21.521]  I think they're scared of an armed electorate is what they're scared of.
[01:43:40.816 --> 01:43:43.617]  I tell you what, I know you've got to go, but we're going to break for one minute.
[01:43:43.637 --> 01:43:48.078]  Let's do five more so we can talk about this creeping totalitarianism with you.
[01:43:48.399 --> 01:43:51.880]  Then it's open phones and news blitz for the rest of the final hour.
[01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:58.182]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:44:25.154 --> 01:44:25.434]  Tim Geithner?
[01:44:25.454 --> 01:44:25.875]  Bernanke?
[01:44:25.975 --> 01:44:26.555]  They're arsonists!
[01:44:26.635 --> 01:44:27.896]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:44:27.916 --> 01:44:30.157]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:44:44.045 --> 01:44:45.887]  Today seems like nobody does care.

[01:45:05.843 --> 01:45:07.765]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:45:08.225 --> 01:45:10.988]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:45:21.516 --> 01:45:30.368]  So, the ATF Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives just shows up in Cornelius, Oregon.
[01:45:31.476 --> 01:45:32.377]  Well, they didn't even show up.
[01:45:32.417 --> 01:45:34.659]  They just seized the stuff coming into the country.
[01:45:34.699 --> 01:45:37.001]  Toy plastic guns that shoot plastic BBs.
[01:45:37.041 --> 01:45:38.483]  Not even BB guns.
[01:45:38.903 --> 01:45:40.645]  And said, this could be a real machine gun.
[01:45:40.685 --> 01:45:41.906]  It's quite easy to convert.
[01:45:42.507 --> 01:45:43.928]  Absolutely made up.
[01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:48.132]  It's an air-powered plastic pellet system.
[01:45:49.453 --> 01:45:55.960]  Anybody that knows about guns and knows about BB guns or air guns, this is an asinine joke.
[01:45:57.034 --> 01:45:59.476]  But this is the domestication of the population.
[01:45:59.496 --> 01:46:04.660]  You know, they ban people in England defending themselves in their own home with a baseball bat or with a butcher knife.
[01:46:05.041 --> 01:46:09.324]  The government has passed a law in Oklahoma where you can't put burglar bars in your house.
[01:46:09.924 --> 01:46:11.606]  So the criminals in the government can come in.
[01:46:11.966 --> 01:46:15.149]  This is not creeping tyranny and totalitarianism.
[01:46:15.269 --> 01:46:17.611]  It's galloping totalitarianism.
[01:46:17.991 --> 01:46:22.154]  What type of feedback have you gotten from other locals, not just the police chief, about this?
[01:46:22.174 --> 01:46:26.057]  The support for us has been incredible.
[01:46:27.846 --> 01:46:40.569]  Just to give you a quick rundown, three of the local television affiliates have come out and done, or one is wait pending, but three television networks are doing reports in shop at our place.
[01:46:41.089 --> 01:46:47.331]  Yesterday I spoke with some fellows on the radio in Las Vegas for about 45 minutes.
[01:46:48.619 --> 01:46:49.040]  Well, Obama's
[01:47:09.119 --> 01:47:18.227]  Obama's Attorney General, two years ago before he was even in office for the Justice Department, argued there is no civilian right to own any firearms.
[01:47:18.808 --> 01:47:22.331]  Obama, as a state senator, was for total ban of guns.
[01:47:22.731 --> 01:47:27.895]  They're moving against the Second Amendment on all fronts, but then saying, stop buying record amounts of firearms.
[01:47:28.156 --> 01:47:29.237]  We don't want your guns.
[01:47:29.637 --> 01:47:31.358]  They're shutting down gun shows illegally.
[01:47:31.399 --> 01:47:32.520]  They're grabbing plastic
[01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:35.382]  Pellet BB guns illegally.
[01:47:35.402 --> 01:47:38.365]  I think this guy will actually get promoted, this ATF guy.
[01:47:38.385 --> 01:47:40.406]  This is the type of guy they want.
[01:47:42.548 --> 01:47:44.030]  But this is a big wake-up call.
[01:47:44.710 --> 01:47:54.939]  Yeah, I've made that comment to several of my friends and customers that this fella that was on TV the other night is perfect Obama fodder there.
[01:47:54.979 --> 01:47:58.262]  You know, I can just see him fitting into the administration just perfectly.
[01:47:59.392 --> 01:48:11.378]  Black, you know, not really educated about the gun, doesn't know how to put a magazine in an M4, but he's standing there with all this pomp and circumstance condemning us for, you know, the tyranny against the country.
[01:48:11.678 --> 01:48:14.799]  It's just, everything is so upside down, it's incredible.
[01:48:15.740 --> 01:48:23.544]  Well, this is a revolution by the collectivist, by the control freaks, and they can't stand it that we're not disarmed.
[01:48:24.784 --> 01:48:25.945]  Yeah, couldn't agree more.
[01:48:27.571 --> 01:48:31.412]  Well, fire out your website one more time for folks that want to go purchase something to support you.
[01:48:32.813 --> 01:48:36.734]  I hope you get your $30,000 back of guns.
[01:48:36.774 --> 01:48:37.635]  Now they've grabbed another $20,000.
[01:48:38.515 --> 01:48:38.895]  Go ahead.
[01:48:39.856 --> 01:48:45.958]  Yeah, our website is www.airsoftoutletnw.com.
[01:48:47.170 --> 01:48:53.575]  And so you had the ATF call them from the East and say you have no jurisdiction and you said they just don't care.
[01:48:53.615 --> 01:48:55.516]  I mean, when you call them, do they respond?
[01:48:55.536 --> 01:48:56.857]  You said they won't give you paperwork?
[01:48:56.897 --> 01:48:58.579]  I mean, that's even more outrageous.
[01:48:58.879 --> 01:49:02.181]  It's like the airports now grab your laptop and won't give it back.
[01:49:03.082 --> 01:49:09.487]  Well, I was mentioning this ATF agent I spoke to a week or so ago who seemed like a really level-headed fella.
[01:49:10.151 --> 01:49:26.438]  And he was the one that told me that Customs has my company flagged for all imports now, but also he told me that I would most likely have to file under the Freedom of Information Act in order to try to get their laboratory results.
[01:49:27.199 --> 01:49:34.222]  And I've been reading up on the Freedom of Information Act, and there are something like nine exemptions that various
[01:49:34.902 --> 01:49:43.708]  Oh yeah, they could go into a five and dime and confiscate all their water guns and say it could be easily converted into a nuclear weapon.
[01:49:43.728 --> 01:49:46.709]  Yeah, or you could put acid in those and squirt acid in somebody's face.
[01:49:59.745 --> 01:50:01.568]  Anything can be turned into a weapon.
[01:50:01.909 --> 01:50:03.311]  They want us disarmed.
[01:50:03.491 --> 01:50:04.593]  They want us disarmed.
[01:50:04.873 --> 01:50:06.736]  Thank you for spending time with us, Brad Martin.
[01:50:06.956 --> 01:50:08.919]  We're standing behind you in the Second Amendment.
[01:50:09.660 --> 01:50:10.422]  Thank you, Mr. Jones.
[01:50:11.042 --> 01:50:11.343]  Thank you.
[01:50:14.775 --> 01:50:18.396]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:50:18.716 --> 01:50:26.859]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:50:27.579 --> 01:50:31.640]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:43.044]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:50:43.664 --> 01:50:52.686]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:50:53.166 --> 01:50:58.227]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:50:58.608 --> 01:51:05.789]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:51:06.089 --> 01:51:08.830]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:51:12.708 --> 01:51:16.951]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:51:17.251 --> 01:51:21.334]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:51:21.594 --> 01:51:27.017]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:51:27.337 --> 01:51:27.798]  It's true.
[01:51:28.098 --> 01:51:32.641]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:51:32.961 --> 01:51:33.502]  Number 3.
[01:51:33.782 --> 01:51:37.065]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:51:37.365 --> 01:51:41.108]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:51:41.289 --> 01:51:41.829]  Number 4.
[01:51:42.069 --> 01:51:44.451]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:51:44.832 --> 01:51:48.235]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:51:48.515 --> 01:51:48.735]  Number 5.
[01:51:49.316 --> 01:51:53.219]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:51:53.460 --> 01:51:58.224]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:51:58.504 --> 01:52:02.527]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:52:02.667 --> 01:52:04.228]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:52:04.448 --> 01:52:06.549]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[01:52:09.311 --> 01:52:16.476]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[01:52:16.536 --> 01:52:19.337]  That produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:52:19.457 --> 01:52:20.697]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:52:20.737 --> 01:52:21.417]  It's very real.
[01:52:21.557 --> 01:52:23.678]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:52:23.798 --> 01:52:25.318]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:52:25.438 --> 01:52:29.780]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with a Cola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:32.280]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[01:53:05.091 --> 01:53:11.655]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:53:13.556 --> 01:53:19.080]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:24.947 --> 01:53:25.808]  All right, we're back live.
[01:53:25.868 --> 01:53:28.389]  And I'm going to go to a bunch of your phone calls.
[01:53:28.789 --> 01:53:33.933]  At the bottom of the hour, I want to play this video clip of Nigel Farage, member of the European Union Parliament for England.
[01:53:34.433 --> 01:53:36.154]  He's refused to apologize.
[01:53:36.614 --> 01:53:39.556]  There's the PrisonPlanet.com headline, a joking headline.
[01:53:40.216 --> 01:53:42.818]  MEP Farage apologizes to bank clerks.
[01:53:42.838 --> 01:53:47.221]  But I'm going to have Kurt, when he puts the Infowars version up, say refuses to apologize.
[01:53:47.241 --> 01:53:49.722]  I mean, I get the joke, but that's coming up.
[01:53:50.102 --> 01:53:52.304]  And I've got a bunch of other news we haven't even gotten to yet.
[01:53:53.197 --> 01:53:53.737]  It's an honor, Alex.
[01:53:53.757 --> 01:53:54.138]  An ex-veteran.
[01:53:54.178 --> 01:53:55.178]  Just a quick rundown.
[01:53:55.198 --> 01:53:58.020]  What they know down the road is they're going to implode the economy even worse.
[01:53:58.281 --> 01:54:00.482]  When you've got half of Detroit not wanting to finish high school,
[01:54:17.324 --> 01:54:21.166]  Okay, when they implode... Half of Detroit is out of work.
[01:54:21.806 --> 01:54:46.298]  Yeah, I know that too, but when they really implode the economy, because they refuse to address NAFTA and GATT, and force, do a little protectionism for American workers and manufacturing industry... Protectionism built this country, and they know, and the roving hordes of criminals, they're going to try to take our guns so we can't protect ourselves, and then make us go along with the police.
[01:54:46.758 --> 01:54:51.341]  I am a very strong supporter of you and for people having guns.
[01:54:51.841 --> 01:55:05.510]  But if you remember Braveheart, Uncle Carlisle said to the young boy, Mel Gibson, when he was a child, he said first, he tapped him in the head, first learn to use this.
[01:55:06.091 --> 01:55:11.214]  And then he pointed to the sword and held the sword, and then I'll teach you how to use this.
[01:55:12.134 --> 01:55:14.456]  And I am a very strong gun supporter.
[01:55:14.901 --> 01:55:24.507]  And I'm glad you brought that talking point up about the gun show, because what they're doing is they're getting ready to really make things really bad.
[01:55:24.527 --> 01:55:28.309]  Can you believe they're grabbing toy guns that don't even shoot BBs?
[01:55:28.329 --> 01:55:29.709]  Metal BBs?
[01:55:30.250 --> 01:55:33.992]  Yes, because what they need to do is get the replicas off.
[01:55:34.693 --> 01:55:43.800]  The market, because it's going to get so bad in this country, people and children and women are going to start using replicas.
[01:55:43.820 --> 01:55:46.382]  To scare people away, exactly.
[01:55:46.842 --> 01:55:48.444]  Great point Bob, I appreciate your call.
[01:55:48.684 --> 01:55:49.905]  That's exactly what's happening.
[01:55:50.285 --> 01:55:53.928]  It's growing the gun culture because a lot of people are too afraid to buy a BB gun.
[01:55:54.288 --> 01:55:56.050]  They're too afraid to buy a real firearm.
[01:55:56.750 --> 01:56:10.634]  So it goes BB guns, firearms, but below that, you've got these paintballs, and I've seen the feds going after those, that are air-powered, and going after these airsoft that shoot the little plastic pellets.
[01:56:11.514 --> 01:56:14.915]  And people are having wars with them, they're learning marksmanship.
[01:56:15.116 --> 01:56:15.876]  Look, here's the deal.
[01:56:16.736 --> 01:56:18.437]  Why do I support the apple seed movement?
[01:56:18.837 --> 01:56:20.737]  The firearms training for citizens everywhere?
[01:56:21.218 --> 01:56:22.838]  Because we're relearning our heritage.
[01:56:23.638 --> 01:56:35.803]  I mean, when I was 14, folks, I'd been shooting guns since I was 4 years old, and I really got into it, and I could shoot through the same hole on a good day at 200 yards and there wasn't any wind.
[01:56:36.603 --> 01:56:37.623]  I mean, I'm not exaggerating.
[01:56:38.243 --> 01:56:41.084]  I could shoot through the same hole.
[01:56:41.764 --> 01:56:46.865]  Now, 200 yards, I can, you know, shoot a pattern about that big with, say, a 30-odd-6.
[01:56:47.025 --> 01:56:48.785]  I'm still a great marksman.
[01:56:48.865 --> 01:56:50.546]  A few times I get to go deer hunting.
[01:56:50.586 --> 01:56:52.426]  I won't even shoot deer up close or wild hogs.
[01:56:52.466 --> 01:56:55.407]  I'll wait till I see one 600 yards away.
[01:56:55.967 --> 01:57:02.288]  Because I want a little bit of... a little bit of challenge.
[01:57:05.100 --> 01:57:20.099]  And what I really learned to shoot good with was a .22 rifle, single shot, just walking around, out in the woods, out in the hills and dales of our family ranch, where my dad learned to shoot, where his dad learned to shoot, where his dad learned to shoot, you know, all the way back.
[01:57:21.132 --> 01:57:22.233]  And the women were tough.
[01:57:22.253 --> 01:57:30.579]  I mean, you look at photos of my great-grandmother riding around with that, you know, just a .22 saddle gun, riding around, running the cattle.
[01:57:30.599 --> 01:57:32.340]  They got black and white photos of it.
[01:57:32.380 --> 01:57:36.223]  It's just so amazing to see those free people out there.
[01:57:36.243 --> 01:57:40.325]  And women were tough, and women were strong, and women defended themselves.
[01:57:40.466 --> 01:57:43.388]  And when America did go to war, everyone
[01:57:44.048 --> 01:57:47.770]  The Germans in World War I were terrified of Americans.
[01:57:48.150 --> 01:57:52.572]  Because it didn't matter if you were from New York or Texas or Tennessee or California.
[01:57:52.812 --> 01:57:54.633]  Americans were just dreaded.
[01:57:55.393 --> 01:57:56.213]  Dreaded!
[01:57:56.894 --> 01:58:02.016]  Because Germans weren't brought up compared to Americans shooting as many firearms.
[01:58:02.116 --> 01:58:04.357]  Because they didn't let their slaves be armed.
[01:58:04.397 --> 01:58:06.918]  Only the wealthy really had the money and the licenses to hunt.
[01:58:08.499 --> 01:58:19.833]  And the Germans were tough and fought and were intelligent fighters, but they could brush the British aside, they could brush the French aside, they could brush the Russians aside, but when the Americans showed up, it was doom!
[01:58:22.333 --> 01:58:30.719]  Since then, they've destroyed much of the gun culture, gotten people in big cities, banned the high school shooting clubs that even New York City had just 20 years ago.
[01:58:31.580 --> 01:58:33.681]  And so, mothers get scared of guns.
[01:58:33.721 --> 01:58:34.842]  They get scared of BB guns.
[01:58:34.902 --> 01:58:36.203]  Oh, my kid can't have a BB gun.
[01:58:36.223 --> 01:58:37.183]  You'll shoot your eye out.
[01:58:37.424 --> 01:58:41.366]  And yeah, if your kid's got BB guns and was bad kids with no training, that will happen.
[01:58:41.627 --> 01:58:43.648]  Just like running in the street will happen with no training.
[01:58:44.308 --> 01:58:46.710]  And I said I'd go to your calls, but now I'm ranting on this subject.
[01:58:48.011 --> 01:58:50.533]  But really, the last five years, but I've really noticed the last two,
[01:58:53.337 --> 01:58:55.218]  Masses of people are getting into airsoft.
[01:58:55.258 --> 01:58:59.801]  I mean, you go to Walmart, which I never go to, but I've seen it there the few times I've been there.
[01:59:00.161 --> 01:59:03.583]  You go to Academy, where I go, big sporting goods chain all over Texas.
[01:59:04.123 --> 01:59:09.046]  They've got double aisles in the sporting goods of airsoft.
[01:59:09.166 --> 01:59:11.788]  I mean, people are, while you're there, just grabbing them, buying them.
[01:59:12.068 --> 01:59:13.429]  I tried to buy some more at Christmas.
[01:59:13.469 --> 01:59:14.829]  Almost everything was sold out.
[01:59:15.430 --> 01:59:17.511]  And you've got women grabbing them, men grabbing them.
[01:59:17.931 --> 01:59:22.134]  And they're going out, they're shooting them, they're learning marksmanship, then they're buying real guns.
[01:59:23.403 --> 01:59:27.965]  And it's this doorway into the gun culture that they cannot stand.
[01:59:29.866 --> 01:59:38.590]  Ten years ago in Texas, they tried to pass a law banning Junior Olympics, banning 4-H shooting clubs, banning YMCA shooting clubs, banning people under the age of 18 being a part of this.
[01:59:38.630 --> 01:59:39.550]  We beat that bill.
[01:59:40.170 --> 01:59:41.571]  They've tried it all over the country.
[01:59:42.071 --> 01:59:48.254]  They want to kill the gun culture, and all the polls show the majority of people are swinging back to a pro-gun culture.
[01:59:48.894 --> 01:59:52.476]  They were drinking the Kool-Aid 20, 30 years ago, and they're panicking.
[01:59:52.516 --> 01:59:59.439]  And so, the ATF just lawlessly shows up and says, I say you can't have this toy gun, and just does it.
[02:00:00.119 --> 02:00:00.839]  It's illegal!
[02:00:01.419 --> 02:00:01.860]  You heard him.
[02:00:01.880 --> 02:00:07.702]  He talked to the head ATF regulation import people in D.C., and they said, what on earth?
[02:00:08.142 --> 02:00:09.103]  You give them my number.
[02:00:10.243 --> 02:00:11.824]  You tell them, you know, call me.
[02:00:12.344 --> 02:00:14.285]  And he calls up and tells them they don't even want to hear it.
[02:00:15.433 --> 02:00:22.261]  So, they're showing us who they are, and they cannot stand you.
[02:00:22.582 --> 02:00:34.356]  And folks, buy a book on gun safety, or go to a gun shooting range, pay a guy, you know, 30 bucks that works there to give you an hour lesson, because even with Airsoft,
[02:00:35.228 --> 02:00:35.828]  Or anything.
[02:00:36.148 --> 02:00:39.310]  You must train your children first how the gun works.
[02:00:39.650 --> 02:00:41.790]  You must show them how to use it.
[02:00:41.830 --> 02:00:43.971]  They must do it the first 10 or 15 times.
[02:00:43.991 --> 02:00:48.193]  You take them out in the backyard to shoot the airsoft or wherever you go shoot it.
[02:00:49.533 --> 02:00:51.314]  Shooting at tin cans or whatever the case is.
[02:00:51.914 --> 02:00:56.156]  That if they don't do everything just right, hold at their side, never aiming at anyone,
[02:00:57.563 --> 02:01:00.884]  Then the first time they do something wrong, you say, I'm taking it away from you for a week.
[02:01:01.364 --> 02:01:02.324]  And then they'll remember.
[02:01:02.384 --> 02:01:03.725]  Then you train them on that.
[02:01:04.065 --> 02:01:05.585]  You train them as if it's a real gun.
[02:01:06.225 --> 02:01:10.766]  Once you've learned basic safety yourself, for those that aren't in the culture of liberty, we want you to join us.
[02:01:11.386 --> 02:01:12.147]  It's an open hand.
[02:01:12.707 --> 02:01:13.847]  Stand with George Washington in 1776.
[02:01:13.907 --> 02:01:14.587]  Be an armed, free person.
[02:01:19.488 --> 02:01:23.129]  Then after they know their gun safety for a year with an airsoft, get them a BB gun.
[02:01:23.529 --> 02:01:26.129]  Only let them take it out, lock it up, when you're with them.
[02:01:26.630 --> 02:01:30.390]  And they will be completely gun safety for the rest of their lives.
[02:01:30.470 --> 02:01:31.611]  It's like dog training.
[02:01:32.051 --> 02:01:34.731]  You must pass on the liberty.
[02:01:35.031 --> 02:01:38.172]  You must pass the sword on, generation after generation.
[02:01:38.212 --> 02:01:41.833]  You must not allow them to geld you, to castrate you.
[02:01:41.913 --> 02:01:44.234]  Okay, I just spent 10 minutes on that, let's go to calls.
[02:01:44.574 --> 02:01:45.954]  Scott in Arizona, you're on the air.
[02:01:47.071 --> 02:01:48.372]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking the call.
[02:01:48.772 --> 02:02:04.461]  Hey, I know it's been a little while since I think you've had Dr. Labo on and I just want to bring to everybody's attention the wonderful John McCain who's running re-election commercials here in Arizona talking about how he's not for big business and how he's fighting Obama.
[02:02:05.234 --> 02:02:05.834]  Yes, I think so.
[02:02:29.944 --> 02:02:30.344]  Yeah, it is.
[02:02:51.102 --> 02:03:09.618]  If the FDA suspects that there could be a problem with a product, with a particular supplement, they can take full control over that supplement, yank it off the shelves, give it over to the pharmaceuticals under use patents and this supports completely putting
[02:03:10.439 --> 02:03:15.163]  Just like the ATF has been given phony power to do whatever it wants outside law.
[02:03:15.503 --> 02:03:19.727]  Just like the Environmental Protection Agency is listing carbon dioxide as a deadly nerve weapon.
[02:03:20.147 --> 02:03:21.528]  The most deadly thing ever known.
[02:03:21.548 --> 02:03:22.970]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:03:23.550 --> 02:03:25.712]  Congress won't pass the law, so they just do it.
[02:03:26.032 --> 02:03:26.573]  Great points.
[02:03:26.593 --> 02:03:28.635]  In fact, I keep meaning to cover that McCain Act.
[02:03:29.215 --> 02:03:30.276]  We've got a search engine for me.
[02:03:30.296 --> 02:03:31.877]  We'll cover it coming up after some more calls.
[02:03:32.757 --> 02:03:34.418]  McCain bill to restrict supplements.
[02:03:34.478 --> 02:03:36.019]  It's been all over the mainstream news.
[02:03:36.519 --> 02:03:42.983]  And then there was that Toronto Star article about pharmacies told to pull supplements off shelves.
[02:03:43.003 --> 02:03:43.943]  They just said, period.
[02:03:44.264 --> 02:03:46.245]  This all must be prescription.
[02:03:46.625 --> 02:03:53.209]  And you've got the big pharma companies patenting fish oil, patenting vitamin C, patenting
[02:03:54.562 --> 02:03:55.463]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:04:23.857 --> 02:04:27.861]  Hey, I wanted to say, first off, thanks to you and your staff for all the good you're doing for this great country.
[02:04:28.362 --> 02:04:34.248]  Second off, I was wondering about the North American Union, if you wonder if we're just on some turns towards the end of that.
[02:04:34.769 --> 02:04:37.832]  And also, I have to be hurried, because I've got to go do other stuff.
[02:04:37.892 --> 02:04:42.637]  But if Kevin Trudeau, when he was on your show, he talked about the stock market collapse around 9,000 points.
[02:04:42.677 --> 02:04:45.841]  I wonder if you had heard any information from him and what was going on with that situation.
[02:04:46.877 --> 02:04:51.761]  No, I don't know about what Kevin Drudeau says, but I don't even really remember that, but I'll look into it.
[02:04:52.121 --> 02:04:55.163]  But your other question was very, very important.
[02:04:55.604 --> 02:04:56.665]  What was the first question again?
[02:04:56.685 --> 02:04:57.966]  It was about the North American Union?
[02:04:58.366 --> 02:04:58.846]  Yes, sir.
[02:04:58.966 --> 02:05:05.211]  It's all about the salient economy and all the, like, everything that's going on with everything sort of collapsing in finance.
[02:05:05.291 --> 02:05:07.773]  Let me comment on that on the other side.
[02:05:07.833 --> 02:05:09.415]  It's a very important question.
[02:05:10.055 --> 02:05:12.137]  Then Blake, Roger, Bill and others, stay with us.

[02:07:13.994 --> 02:07:17.639]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:07:18.020 --> 02:07:21.024]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:07:21.265 --> 02:07:22.667]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:07:23.568 --> 02:07:26.049]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:07:26.810 --> 02:07:32.292]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:07:32.432 --> 02:07:37.474]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:07:37.995 --> 02:07:47.619]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:07:47.739 --> 02:07:49.861]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:07:50.081 --> 02:07:51.422]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:07:51.662 --> 02:07:53.944]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:07:54.124 --> 02:07:55.965]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:07:55.985 --> 02:08:01.069]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:08:01.409 --> 02:08:06.193]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[02:09:18.251 --> 02:09:19.892]  Central Standard Time.
[02:09:19.912 --> 02:09:22.114]  12 noon to 4 p.m.
[02:09:22.174 --> 02:09:22.514]  Eastern.
[02:09:24.016 --> 02:09:33.363]  Got some big guests coming up this week and next week, like Jesse Ventura, Max Keiser, Gerald Cilente, and Ron Paul.
[02:09:34.324 --> 02:09:36.845]  Congressman Ron Paul, what, he's on Thursday, right?
[02:09:37.726 --> 02:09:38.507]  Thursday, correct?
[02:09:38.787 --> 02:09:39.488]  Double confirmed?
[02:09:39.548 --> 02:09:39.748]  Yes.
[02:09:41.681 --> 02:09:47.764]  Okay, let me answer the last caller, Toby in West Virginia's question.
[02:09:49.305 --> 02:09:57.850]  The North American Union signed in March of 2005, secret agreement, FOIA request, Judicial Watch sued when they wouldn't give them to him, got it.
[02:09:58.670 --> 02:10:07.555]  It talks about, it's in my film Endgame, we have copies of the documents, North American integration by stealth for a North American Union, towards a union.
[02:10:07.995 --> 02:10:11.077]  And Vicente Fox has been on CNN and said it is a North American Union.
[02:10:12.301 --> 02:10:19.649]  And if you notice, they have cross-military agreements, cross-drug trafficking interdiction agreements, cutting off their competition.
[02:10:20.249 --> 02:10:21.431]  They have agreements on trade.
[02:10:21.471 --> 02:10:23.433]  They have internal trade ports with Mexico.
[02:10:24.294 --> 02:10:28.238]  And the Napa Superhighway is the big leg of it in Texas.
[02:10:28.618 --> 02:10:32.442]  They just renamed it last year, but I saw Dallas Morning News Sunday.
[02:10:33.263 --> 02:10:42.287]  When I was at Dan's Hamburgers driving home, getting a hamburger, and I didn't have a $1.50 to buy the Sunday paper of change, but I saw it in the paper machine.
[02:10:42.968 --> 02:10:48.510]  It said, oh, this big highway that wasn't going to be a toll road in Dallas is going to be one.
[02:10:48.590 --> 02:10:51.472]  It was part of the Texas, Trans-Texas Corridor.
[02:10:52.932 --> 02:10:56.635]  Part of the Napa superhighway system, but now it's just been named something different.
[02:10:56.895 --> 02:11:05.761]  So what they did is, they stopped branding it as the big North American superhighway, and they just call it now, uh, legs of it.
[02:11:06.428 --> 02:11:11.290]  Oh, we won't make this road outside Austin a toll road since the legislature said no and since taxpayers already paid for it.
[02:11:11.710 --> 02:11:12.690]  Oh, it is now.
[02:11:13.290 --> 02:11:18.872]  Oh, we're not going to build these 8,000 miles of roads or seize 8,000 miles of roads in Texas and put toll roads on it.
[02:11:18.892 --> 02:11:22.394]  We won't call it the Trans-Texas Corridor anymore, but we're just going to go ahead and do it.
[02:11:22.734 --> 02:11:31.577]  I remember early 2009, it was in the Associated Press, that pull up the headline, Trans-Texas Corridor cancelled.
[02:11:32.884 --> 02:11:45.388]  And in the third paragraph down, in the headline, Trans-Texas Corridor Cancelled, it said, the new plan is to no longer have that name, but build them each as a piece.
[02:11:46.029 --> 02:11:51.650]  In pieces, and take over existing roads, no longer under the high publicity name.
[02:11:52.411 --> 02:11:58.693]  And so, out of depression, out of recession, if you read the SPP documents that Judicial Watch got that we cover in Endgame,
[02:12:00.171 --> 02:12:04.573]  They said, out of the threat of terror, out of economic collapse, out of a flu pandemic.
[02:12:06.614 --> 02:12:07.014]  That's it.
[02:12:07.574 --> 02:12:08.235]  Print that for me.
[02:12:11.096 --> 02:12:14.198]  Out of that, in fact, go to the original news source so I get the whole article, not just the blurb.
[02:12:14.598 --> 02:12:15.618]  It was saved in InfoWars.
[02:12:17.739 --> 02:12:21.361]  Out of all these crises, they then push the integration.
[02:12:22.651 --> 02:12:27.932]  I just wanted to call and say that this Friday, the Sarnia City Council members are meeting to talk about the fluoride, which is already in our water.
[02:12:27.952 --> 02:12:30.713]  And so me and a couple of my friends are going to go down with a fact sheet
[02:12:52.847 --> 02:12:56.010]  Stand there and hand them out and talk to everybody who comes in or goes out.
[02:12:56.070 --> 02:12:57.571]  You need more fluoride!
[02:12:57.611 --> 02:12:58.672]  That's why you're upset.
[02:12:59.052 --> 02:13:01.234]  Drink your extra fluoride and you'll start feeling better.
[02:13:01.254 --> 02:13:05.057]  That's pretty much what they claim.
[02:13:05.958 --> 02:13:07.359]  Well, give the name of your town again.
[02:13:07.419 --> 02:13:11.702]  Everybody should go who's listening in that surrounding area and say, stop forced medicating.
[02:13:11.762 --> 02:13:18.808]  Even if you believe fluoride is good for your teeth, which the American Dental Association three years ago said, kids under six shouldn't do it.
[02:13:18.828 --> 02:13:21.250]  It gives you dental fluorosis, weakens your teeth.
[02:13:22.678 --> 02:13:30.244]  Say for sunburn, you don't, you know, to stop a sunburn, you don't drink sunscreen, is the analogy I've seen people put out.
[02:13:30.524 --> 02:13:37.729]  So why are they force-medicating us and now proposing lithium and Prozac in our water to make us stop killing each other?
[02:13:37.949 --> 02:13:43.813]  If it would just stop one murder, or if it would stop one assault, shouldn't we all just be drugged?
[02:13:44.294 --> 02:13:46.355]  It's a kindler, gentler place.
[02:13:46.395 --> 02:13:48.137]  But take the North American Union.
[02:13:48.797 --> 02:13:53.463]  Think of all the headlines you've seen in your Canadian news about the Olympics, US troops there.
[02:13:54.284 --> 02:13:57.509]  Think about how you're in the North American Union on that front.
[02:13:59.992 --> 02:14:01.213]  Yeah, it's getting pretty bad.
[02:14:01.233 --> 02:14:05.960]  You can see it happening, but I do see definitely like everywhere I go,
[02:14:07.031 --> 02:14:14.693]  There's like, within one classroom I've seen, there's like three-quarters of the classroom really knew what was going on and had seen some of your films and were listening.
[02:14:14.713 --> 02:14:16.994]  Was that in college or high school?
[02:14:17.654 --> 02:14:18.174]  High school.
[02:14:18.634 --> 02:14:22.195]  So in high school, three-quarters of the class know what we're doing?
[02:14:23.115 --> 02:14:29.337]  Yeah, well, a couple of them were my friends, but I informed the teachers of what's going on.
[02:14:29.984 --> 02:14:34.906]  And one of the students came up to me and said, oh, so you've heard of Bohemian Grove?
[02:14:34.986 --> 02:14:38.047]  And I started laughing and started talking to him about it.
[02:14:38.447 --> 02:14:42.189]  Hey, give us the name of the town and the date of the protest against the fluoride.
[02:14:43.129 --> 02:14:45.890]  This Friday at City Hall in Sarnia, Ontario.
[02:14:47.411 --> 02:14:47.891]  What time?
[02:14:48.951 --> 02:14:50.412]  Well, I'm going to go down there.
[02:14:50.472 --> 02:14:53.493]  We're going to go down there probably 8 o'clock.
[02:14:53.813 --> 02:14:54.133]  OK, good job.
[02:14:54.153 --> 02:14:54.574]  Good job.
[02:14:56.527 --> 02:14:57.949]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14:57.969 --> 02:15:00.393]  On the other side, more of your calls, tons of news.
[02:15:00.693 --> 02:15:02.295]  Nigel Farish, Fighting the Bankers.
[02:15:02.376 --> 02:15:02.936]  Hoorah!
[02:15:03.257 --> 02:15:04.158]  We're on the march.
[02:15:04.659 --> 02:15:06.261]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:15:07.183 --> 02:15:09.866]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:17:42.299 --> 02:17:51.585]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:17:51.625 --> 02:17:52.366]  This capitalism?
[02:17:52.426 --> 02:17:58.570]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:17:58.690 --> 02:17:59.511]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:17:59.571 --> 02:18:02.673]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[02:18:02.813 --> 02:18:03.593]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:18:03.613 --> 02:18:05.134]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:18:05.154 --> 02:18:05.314]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:05.354 --> 02:18:05.635]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:21.826 --> 02:18:27.690]  I was sittin' in traffic, listenin' to the radio.
[02:18:27.871 --> 02:18:33.695]  George Strait was singin' seashores of old Mexico.
[02:18:36.824 --> 02:18:49.308]  Alright, I'm going to take some more of your calls.
[02:18:49.348 --> 02:18:50.569]  Didn't play a little bit of this video.
[02:18:50.589 --> 02:18:51.529]  It's ten minutes long.
[02:18:52.209 --> 02:18:54.770]  It's all up on PrisonPlanet.com if you want to see the whole thing.
[02:18:55.530 --> 02:19:01.995]  Nigel Farage talking about how they're ordering him to not criticize Herman Van Rompuy, violating his free speech.
[02:19:02.015 --> 02:19:04.137]  Herman Van Rompuy is unelected.
[02:19:04.177 --> 02:19:10.602]  The bureaucrats put him in as the head of the EU, but then the elected parliament from the nations has no authority or power.
[02:19:12.664 --> 02:19:14.345]  And England never voted to be under this.
[02:19:14.986 --> 02:19:16.207]  They're just expanding it.
[02:19:16.807 --> 02:19:21.391]  And every country that gets to vote on it, like France, votes to get out, but then the bureaucrats won't let them get out.
[02:19:21.912 --> 02:19:24.554]  So that is coming up amongst some other important news.
[02:19:26.192 --> 02:19:28.613]  Right now, let's go ahead and talk to Roger in Georgia.
[02:19:28.673 --> 02:19:29.613]  Roger, you're on the air.
[02:19:31.033 --> 02:19:34.074]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to call and thank you for always being spot on.
[02:19:34.134 --> 02:19:36.154]  I really enjoyed your interview with Shooter Jennings.
[02:19:36.174 --> 02:19:37.674]  Didn't realize he was Waylon's son.
[02:19:38.635 --> 02:19:43.416]  The reason that I'm calling is I just wanted to tell you about our local newspaper here, the Cherokee Ledger News.
[02:19:43.436 --> 02:19:49.957]  You know, rather than talking about the fact that teachers are getting pay cuts of 5% next year, furloughed, and the economy's terrible,
[02:19:50.327 --> 02:20:09.579]  They're excited to let everybody know that the forces with our police department, we're getting new Bearcat armored vehicles, and they're going to be sent out on all domestic violence calls, 90% of police calls, and these nice vehicles are going to have blue lights in them, so when they come... Yeah, armored tanks rolling around just everywhere because we're the enemy.
[02:20:09.639 --> 02:20:12.421]  The government is building up to wage war against the people.
[02:20:13.862 --> 02:20:14.422]  Absolutely.
[02:20:14.442 --> 02:20:19.986]  I don't have to take my kid to the D-Day museum or build, you know, toy tanks with him at home to get him to learn about military equipment.
[02:20:20.299 --> 02:20:23.960]  Because it's going to be in his neighborhood, just like communist Russia during the Cold War.
[02:20:25.581 --> 02:20:30.143]  I mean, look, by every yardstick, we are becoming a mega tyranny.
[02:20:30.283 --> 02:20:30.663]  Go ahead.
[02:20:31.703 --> 02:20:32.223]  Absolutely.
[02:20:32.844 --> 02:20:34.564]  But yeah, I just wanted to add one more comment.
[02:20:34.584 --> 02:20:47.769]  I want to say again, I really enjoyed, you know, Stephen King's lead-in to Shooter Jennings, and I thought a good idea for you is to put together Alex Jones' top 20 hits, because I just love the music you play during the interims, and maybe have your little commentary with each song that you play.
[02:20:47.809 --> 02:20:50.150]  And I just wanted to share that with you, because I just think you're awesome.
[02:20:50.506 --> 02:20:51.286]  You're doing a great thing.
[02:20:51.306 --> 02:20:56.688]  You really woke me up about a year ago, and I'm bringing some family members on board that would have never believed what's going on.
[02:20:56.708 --> 02:21:03.070]  But now that I can show them locally in the paper and stuff, which you're talking about, it brings the needle to the head, so to speak.
[02:21:04.630 --> 02:21:07.611]  Well, sir, I appreciate your call, and I love the great point you make about
[02:21:08.447 --> 02:21:10.228]  Like we're communist Russia or something.
[02:21:10.848 --> 02:21:13.889]  I mean, it's just, the whole world's saying we're like communist Russia.
[02:21:13.949 --> 02:21:26.274]  I mean, this is, but again, the black mask, the tanks, the wheeled vehicles, the armored vehicles, the APCs, the LAVs, it is all to intimidate us.
[02:21:26.415 --> 02:21:30.516]  If it really goes into martial law, those things aren't gonna do anything for them.
[02:21:32.477 --> 02:21:36.619]  Tyrants go to bars, tyrants live at home, tyrants are out on the street.
[02:21:37.412 --> 02:21:43.573]  I mean, if they've ever gotten into a physical conflict, which I don't want to happen, their APCs will become our APCs.
[02:21:44.433 --> 02:21:45.373]  I mean, don't you understand?
[02:21:45.433 --> 02:21:50.474]  You could have no weapons and take back your country with a baseball bat.
[02:21:51.134 --> 02:21:55.415]  You can get all the guns you ever wanted with a baseball bat or a ball-peen hammer or a sword.
[02:21:55.955 --> 02:22:00.096]  You can get all the weapons, all the APCs, if you've got the will.
[02:22:00.496 --> 02:22:02.136]  But again, we want to fix it.
[02:22:02.176 --> 02:22:04.177]  We want to reach out to police and military.
[02:22:04.697 --> 02:22:05.797]  Go to talk to them in your town.
[02:22:08.905 --> 02:22:10.186]  Discuss with them what's happening.
[02:22:10.226 --> 02:22:11.407]  Most of these cops aren't bad.
[02:22:11.427 --> 02:22:14.249]  Okay, let's go to another caller.
[02:22:14.269 --> 02:22:16.231]  Let's talk to Bill in North Carolina.
[02:22:16.271 --> 02:22:17.072]  Bill, you're on the air.
[02:22:17.092 --> 02:22:17.832]  Hey, Alex.
[02:22:17.872 --> 02:22:18.713]  How are you doing today?
[02:22:19.073 --> 02:22:19.353]  Good.
[02:22:19.954 --> 02:22:20.134]  Good.
[02:22:20.174 --> 02:22:20.514]  Hey, Alex.
[02:22:20.554 --> 02:22:23.637]  First off, I want to thank you for waking me up about two years ago.
[02:22:24.197 --> 02:22:31.823]  I want to just add on to a conversation that you had with Brad Martin on the user-consumer side of the Airsoft.
[02:22:31.964 --> 02:22:38.449]  Right after Christmas, after a bunch of kids in my neighborhood got the Airsoft guns, we went out to my boss's property where we have
[02:22:39.210 --> 02:22:42.312]  Tell your story, tell your story, but I see in the news about every week or two
[02:23:08.294 --> 02:23:22.442]  I've had friends, I have some Iraq war vet friends who were out at their own cousin's farm in a rural area of the state and they were having an airsoft battle
[02:23:23.582 --> 02:23:41.874]  And even their neighbors called the police on them and they confiscated the airsoft, so people aren't allowed to have fun because the public is so brainwashed that if they see people running around, you know, shooting toy guns at each other, so what happened?
[02:23:41.894 --> 02:23:46.057]  You're on your own property, you're out there, you got people having a good time, what happened?
[02:23:46.547 --> 02:23:54.195]  Well, the first thing is, I was in the woods and I came out with my weapon down on the ground and my hands on my head.
[02:23:55.196 --> 02:23:58.660]  We go up to the main man and we're like, hey, look, we own this.
[02:23:58.740 --> 02:23:59.761]  And he's like, well, let me see the guns.
[02:23:59.781 --> 02:24:01.062]  And I was like, dude, they're fake.
[02:24:01.543 --> 02:24:02.584]  Can you see the orange on them?
[02:24:02.604 --> 02:24:07.269]  So we took the casing off and we showed him the BBs inside of it.
[02:24:07.978 --> 02:24:11.799]  After arguing with him for about 15 minutes, they finally agreed to leave.
[02:24:12.459 --> 02:24:13.659]  Wait a minute!
[02:24:13.859 --> 02:24:20.080]  So when they knew it was a plastic toy gun, people aren't really familiar with airsoft.
[02:24:20.100 --> 02:24:21.080]  It's like paintball.
[02:24:22.040 --> 02:24:22.901]  You were still bad.
[02:24:22.941 --> 02:24:24.641]  See, because if they come, you're bad.
[02:24:24.901 --> 02:24:27.301]  You're a slave with even a toy gun.
[02:24:27.641 --> 02:24:29.302]  That doesn't look good to a parasite.
[02:24:29.762 --> 02:24:30.422]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:24:31.082 --> 02:24:37.263]  And the worst part about it is, you know, we've got all these scared kids and they're saying, well, you kids are running into the other buildings holding, you know,
[02:24:37.628 --> 02:24:41.651]  Going up to people with weapons and it's like, no we're not, we're sitting on our own private property.
[02:24:41.831 --> 02:24:47.375]  Yeah, this is about teaching the kids, no, you're not going to be involved in a Second Amendment culture.
[02:24:47.695 --> 02:24:56.001]  That's why they have these drills from Texas to Minnesota, from California to New York, every state I've seen articles, I put it in some of my films.
[02:24:56.801 --> 02:25:00.564]  Where the police, unannounced, come in, point real guns at kids' heads.
[02:25:01.085 --> 02:25:04.668]  In one case in Dallas, they killed cop of the year, just so happened.
[02:25:04.688 --> 02:25:08.712]  On video in Detroit, the cop shoots himself.
[02:25:09.949 --> 02:25:13.692]  And they scream and yell, I'm gonna kill you, I'm a militia, who's against public school.
[02:25:13.972 --> 02:25:19.015]  To demonize and brainwash, that's trauma-based mind control, to demonize the Second Amendment.
[02:25:19.275 --> 02:25:26.921]  So, so after 15 minutes, I mean, did the cops apologize or did they say, no, we can't wait for the day to even take your toy gun, punk?
[02:25:27.546 --> 02:25:35.310]  No, they had no sense of humor, they were severely upset, and it was crazy.
[02:25:35.790 --> 02:25:53.460]  If I could add one more thing on, too, Alex, for everybody out there that's just learned about Alex, if you purchase a Don't Tread On Me or an InfoWars t-shirt and you wear that in your neighborhood, you will find like-minded people and you will congregate, and for all those people that don't know about it, you'll start to find other people like you.
[02:25:54.246 --> 02:25:55.126]  Well, thank you.
[02:25:55.686 --> 02:26:03.529]  I think you should go to the police station, and I think you should go to city council and make a big deal out of this, because they need to know.
[02:26:04.029 --> 02:26:09.251]  I understand they heard there was a big shootout, but any idiot could pull up and hear gunshots aren't going off.
[02:26:09.511 --> 02:26:13.572]  But once it was a false alarm, that's why I love open carry.
[02:26:13.892 --> 02:26:16.693]  We've got to start putting our guns back in our pickup trucks.
[02:26:16.993 --> 02:26:19.634]  We've got to start having them out in the open and saying, no!
[02:26:20.034 --> 02:26:21.034]  We're Americans!
[02:26:21.334 --> 02:26:25.276]  You're not intimidating us into destroying our right to even play with toy guns.
[02:26:25.316 --> 02:26:26.096]  I appreciate your call.
[02:26:26.616 --> 02:26:27.076]  See, folks?
[02:26:28.177 --> 02:26:30.378]  They're in the big lobby out there to protect toy guns.
[02:26:30.418 --> 02:26:31.778]  So they're coming after the toy guns.
[02:26:32.358 --> 02:26:34.399]  And yeah, when I get up on air... Here it is.
[02:26:36.144 --> 02:26:58.601]  And I say that when you buy a $9.95, these cost us like $5, I think what $5.50 or something, this is a nice hat, that when you buy the tyranny response team or come and take it hats or InfoWars hats or t-shirts, I mean you wear, especially the t-shirts because they're bigger, people can see it from further away, I mean you start wearing this
[02:26:59.722 --> 02:27:08.391]  Around your town or to City Council or wherever you see people or walking your dog, you're going to meet like-minded Patriots.
[02:27:08.411 --> 02:27:09.933]  We have listeners everywhere.
[02:27:10.634 --> 02:27:19.063]  And so you support us, a little bit of money in the hat for the big operation we're building here and all that we do, but you also get great good-looking Patriot apparel.
[02:27:20.657 --> 02:27:23.479]  And you meet like-minded people, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:27:23.779 --> 02:27:27.762]  So check out all the dozens and dozens of t-shirts, hats, and materials.
[02:27:27.802 --> 02:27:35.027]  And every order gets a free pocket constitution with it, and an Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com bumper stickers, which really obsess the establishment.
[02:27:35.467 --> 02:27:37.028]  Okay, you don't have to put it on your card.
[02:27:37.048 --> 02:27:38.269]  You can put it up where other people can see it.
[02:27:39.230 --> 02:27:40.431]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:27:40.451 --> 02:27:41.291]  I've got to move quick now.
[02:27:41.331 --> 02:27:42.072]  Who's up next here?
[02:27:43.393 --> 02:27:45.294]  Derek in South Carolina, you're on the air.
[02:27:46.915 --> 02:27:47.896]  Alex, how you doing?
[02:27:49.175 --> 02:27:49.395]  Good.
[02:27:49.795 --> 02:27:50.876]  Yeah, I just wanted to give you a heads up.
[02:27:50.936 --> 02:28:04.200]  I was driving around this morning and listening to Glenn Beck rant about his Mormon doctrine, and he went on and on about how he believes the Constitution is inspired, literally inspired, of God, right?
[02:28:04.740 --> 02:28:07.201]  Which I just wanted to give you guys a heads up.
[02:28:07.221 --> 02:28:13.784]  It sounds innocent enough, even though it's foolish, but Mormon eschatology teaches that
[02:28:16.072 --> 02:28:22.836]  You know, there's going to be a great Mormon leader to rise up, take control of America, and form a, like, Mormon theocracy of sorts.
[02:28:24.257 --> 02:28:25.217]  Well, I know this.
[02:28:25.297 --> 02:28:30.620]  I'm not an expert on Mormons, but I know that they try to approach the best and brightest.
[02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:33.562]  Well, my dad, you know, had, like, one of the top grade averages at UT, and, uh,
[02:28:36.192 --> 02:28:37.372]  Well, I just married my mother.
[02:28:38.473 --> 02:28:44.874]  Not just Mormons at the door, they sent like the high muckety mucks from Austin, you know, to come say, you've really got to join, we'll really help you and everything.
[02:28:45.515 --> 02:28:47.695]  And I know, and my dad was like, no thanks.
[02:28:48.415 --> 02:28:53.577]  I know there are a lot of Mormons who are big supporters, anti-New World Order, big Ron Paul supporters.
[02:28:54.037 --> 02:28:57.578]  Then you get people like Orrin Hatch and Mitt Romney that are Republican in name only.
[02:28:58.698 --> 02:29:02.261]  Get into all the infighting of different, you know, groups and sex and religions.
[02:29:03.041 --> 02:29:08.505]  But I do, I have read that there's this big Mormon leader coming and I certainly hope it's not Glenn Beck or Mitt Romney.
[02:29:08.525 --> 02:29:12.928]  I appreciate your call because the fruits of these guys is really, really bad news.
[02:29:13.409 --> 02:29:17.051]  And I would also add to that, in fact I have the transcript of it.
[02:29:17.932 --> 02:29:19.013]  I printed it today.
[02:29:19.913 --> 02:29:21.755]  Maybe I'll try to dig it out during the next break.
[02:29:23.658 --> 02:29:29.743]  It's video and quotes of Sarah Palin saying, our Constitution is being destroyed.
[02:29:30.063 --> 02:29:32.445]  We can't let Obama destroy our Constitution.
[02:29:32.465 --> 02:29:33.786]  We just authorized the Patriot Act.
[02:29:33.826 --> 02:29:34.447]  Reauthorized it.
[02:29:35.508 --> 02:29:37.489]  It's following everything Bush did and more.
[02:29:38.250 --> 02:29:43.994]  And she said, yes, if we give these Muslim extremists a fair trial, that destroys our Constitution.
[02:29:44.114 --> 02:29:45.576]  No, that upholds it.
[02:29:46.616 --> 02:29:48.438]  If you've got the proof, they're these terrorists.
[02:29:48.478 --> 02:29:50.680]  But no, you've been holding Khalid Sheikh Mohammed for
[02:29:51.815 --> 02:29:52.715]  Seven and a half years.
[02:29:53.035 --> 02:29:54.476]  They admittedly tortured his family.
[02:29:54.776 --> 02:29:59.077]  He confessed to bombing buildings that weren't built until three years after he was incarcerated.
[02:29:59.777 --> 02:30:06.599]  He might as well have confessed to sinking the Lusitania, or killing Lincoln, or crucifying Jesus.
[02:30:06.699 --> 02:30:10.280]  I mean, this is insane baloney.
[02:30:12.061 --> 02:30:16.682]  And so they say, we support the Constitution by having the Patriot Act.
[02:30:17.122 --> 02:30:19.163]  But see, the name of the Patriot Act is that way.
[02:30:19.203 --> 02:30:20.243]  It's a total deception.
[02:30:21.394 --> 02:30:25.097]  I'm going to go out to break with about four minutes of Nigel Farage.
[02:30:27.840 --> 02:30:30.902]  MEP Farage apologizes to bank clerks, but he didn't really do that.
[02:30:30.922 --> 02:30:32.263]  He's refusing to back down.
[02:30:32.363 --> 02:30:41.251]  UK Independence Party member, European Parliament Nigel Farage has refused to back down over comments he directed towards EU chief and global governance proponent Herman Van Rompuy.
[02:30:41.712 --> 02:30:44.374]  He did apologize for one of the countries he called a non-state.
[02:30:44.994 --> 02:30:48.657]  During a speech in front of the EU Parliament last week in response to calls to apologize,
[02:30:49.298 --> 02:30:51.760]  We'll try to take a few more calls and a few more news stories.
[02:30:51.780 --> 02:30:52.821]  Stay with us.
[02:31:16.337 --> 02:31:21.340]  Well, I've been for a meeting with the President of the Parliament, which is what's described generally as an interview without asking.
[02:31:21.520 --> 02:31:24.081]  We had a fairly frank discussion.
[02:31:24.681 --> 02:31:35.627]  He and I debated what freedom of speech means, and we both agreed that freedom of speech is very important, but we have different definitions of what freedom of speech is.
[02:31:35.987 --> 02:31:44.192]  My interpretation of freedom of speech is that the limits upon it are that you cannot incite violence, but that it is perfectly fair
[02:31:45.012 --> 02:31:49.595]  To criticise other people and especially to do so in a Parliament.
[02:31:49.775 --> 02:31:57.861]  That is not President Buzak's interpretation of free speech and he says that I've undermined the dignity of the Parliament.
[02:31:58.061 --> 02:32:12.450]  I responded to that by making clear that even in their own Charter of Fundamental Rights, which has just been approved as part of the Lisbon Treaty, Article 11 says that people should be able to speak freely without any institutions stopping them from doing so.
[02:32:12.490 --> 02:32:14.352]  Briefly, the upfront of it is this.
[02:32:15.092 --> 02:32:25.953]  I've been asked to apologise to Herbert van Rompuy, I've been asked to apologise to the European Parliament, and I've been asked to apologise to the people of Belgium.
[02:32:27.449 --> 02:32:33.892]  I've had time to reflect, and I've decided that I will make an apology.
[02:32:33.912 --> 02:32:38.415]  The only people I'm going to apologise to are bank clerks the world over.
[02:32:38.535 --> 02:32:41.496]  And if I've offended them, I'm very sorry indeed.
[02:32:41.516 --> 02:32:44.037]  But I'm not going to apologise to them at that run point.
[02:32:44.097 --> 02:32:46.259]  I'm not going to apologise to the European Parliament.
[02:32:46.439 --> 02:32:49.700]  I'm certainly not going to apologise to the people of Belgium.
[02:32:49.840 --> 02:32:54.383]  And as a result of that, the President has said that he won't let this sort of thing happen again.
[02:32:55.163 --> 02:32:57.045]  What a democratic institution this is, isn't it?
[02:32:57.385 --> 02:33:02.029]  He won't let it happen again and he will let me know shortly of what my penalty will be.
[02:33:02.049 --> 02:33:08.014]  So I am assuming that he will suspend me for a period of time from the Parliament.
[02:33:08.034 --> 02:33:10.917]  I am assuming that he will try, through the Conference of Presidents,
[02:33:11.677 --> 02:33:26.222]  I've had to get my position of leader of the group in the Parliament taken away and all I can say is that those of us that have battled against the European institutions on the basis that they were becoming fundamentally undemocratic have been proved to be right.
[02:33:26.262 --> 02:33:29.523]  I have not used unparliamentary language.
[02:33:29.543 --> 02:33:31.744]  I have not incited dislike or hatred.
[02:33:31.824 --> 02:33:36.346]  I have merely expressed an opinion and in doing so there is now actually a debate
[02:33:36.986 --> 02:33:39.871]  But you insulted him.
[02:33:50.934 --> 02:33:52.435]  I don't think that's insulting.
[02:33:52.515 --> 02:34:01.179]  I mean, compared with the sort of insult that I've had in this Parliament from the leaders of the other groups, I don't think that's fair.
[02:34:01.279 --> 02:34:07.582]  And frankly, what Mr Van Rompuy wants to do is to take away from us our democracy and our rights of self-government.
[02:34:07.642 --> 02:34:12.844]  He can't do that without us, as elected members, coming back and saying we're not very happy about it.
[02:34:12.864 --> 02:34:18.567]  It's interesting that he's personally insulted someone by saying he's fired him as a dictator.
[02:34:19.380 --> 02:34:21.402]  Well, I think you have the charisma with that.
[02:34:21.482 --> 02:34:28.050]  I get what I love, and I challenge quite anybody who listens to that speech in the European Parliament.
[02:34:28.070 --> 02:34:37.320]  While many people might agree with the sentiment of what you're saying, doesn't the tone... I mean, you started off by saying, I don't need to be rude, and then went on to be fantastic.
[02:34:37.360 --> 02:34:38.602]  No, I wasn't quite fantastic.
[02:34:38.642 --> 02:34:38.722]  Okay.
[02:34:39.597 --> 02:34:44.401]  That audio's a little bad for radio and TV, but you can watch the whole press conference.
[02:34:44.421 --> 02:34:46.423]  It gets better towards the end.
[02:34:46.463 --> 02:34:49.345]  Let's go ahead and jam in another call right now.
[02:34:49.385 --> 02:34:50.687]  Let's talk to Rick in Florida.
[02:34:51.067 --> 02:34:51.787]  Rick, you're on the air.
[02:34:52.688 --> 02:34:53.689]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:34:54.770 --> 02:34:59.594]  Are you aware that it's been a year since you've posted anything new to your audio blog?
[02:35:00.415 --> 02:35:02.436]  Because I used to really enjoy listening to that.
[02:35:03.457 --> 02:35:07.641]  And, you know, your thoughts outside of the constraints of the radio business.
[02:35:08.956 --> 02:35:09.556]  And it's been a year.
[02:35:09.596 --> 02:35:11.357]  You know, you know, I didn't know.
[02:35:11.417 --> 02:35:12.018]  Time flies.
[02:35:12.398 --> 02:35:13.839]  I do intend to do the radio blog.
[02:35:14.219 --> 02:35:16.320]  I've just got to come give it to somebody and have them upload it.
[02:35:16.881 --> 02:35:20.663]  And then I'm like, I'm doing international TV today, radio tomorrow.
[02:35:21.263 --> 02:35:22.524]  And then I'm so busy.
[02:35:24.305 --> 02:35:26.266]  Sometimes late at night, I do want to say something.
[02:35:26.286 --> 02:35:26.966]  I do remember.
[02:35:27.207 --> 02:35:33.750]  I do need to remember to take the audio recorders home and do the do the audio blog.
[02:35:33.770 --> 02:35:34.431]  That's a good idea.
[02:35:37.673 --> 02:35:38.133]  Anything else?
[02:35:40.086 --> 02:35:40.887]  I appreciate the call, Rick.
[02:35:40.907 --> 02:35:44.430]  We're going to come back and jam in Pete, Vinny, and Nick here at the end of the show.
[02:35:45.151 --> 02:35:59.043]  Deborah Medina, folks, it's your chance to vote for her in Texas, but regardless if she wins or loses, it's already the great showing she made, shows the grassroots support for someone who wants property rights and the Second Amendment.
[02:36:00.244 --> 02:36:02.506]  And that's enough of a reason to vote for her right there.
[02:36:03.307 --> 02:36:04.608]  We'll be right back.
[02:36:04.628 --> 02:36:06.289]  We'll find out what happens tomorrow.
[02:36:06.349 --> 02:36:06.850]  Stay with us.
[02:36:13.849 --> 02:36:16.571]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.
[02:36:16.872 --> 02:36:22.617]  Well, here's an unbelievable chance for you to jumpstart your food savings plan from efoodsdirect.com.

[02:36:31.164 --> 02:36:37.291]  For example, with each pre-production order of three 7-Day Responders, they'll ship a fourth week of food free.
[02:36:37.531 --> 02:36:39.494]  That's Buy 3, Get 1 Free.
[02:36:39.694 --> 02:36:42.397]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[02:36:42.597 --> 02:36:49.165]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you in this Buy 3, Get 1 Free program.
[02:36:50.566 --> 02:36:53.449]  Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see.

[02:37:14.267 --> 02:37:17.912]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:37:18.293 --> 02:37:21.297]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:37:21.538 --> 02:37:22.960]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:37:23.858 --> 02:37:26.319]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:37:26.339 --> 02:37:32.542]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:37:32.723 --> 02:37:37.745]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:37:38.265 --> 02:37:47.890]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:37:48.010 --> 02:37:50.112]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:37:50.372 --> 02:37:51.693]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:37:51.953 --> 02:37:54.215]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:37:54.415 --> 02:37:56.256]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:37:56.536 --> 02:38:01.340]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:38:01.680 --> 02:38:10.807]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:38:14.190 --> 02:38:15.571]  Is it safe to breathe anymore?
[02:38:15.831 --> 02:38:26.921]  Crowded public places, global pandemics, and news reports of potential new strains of bacteria and viruses make you wonder, what if there was a germ killing nasal spray that acted almost like hand sanitizer for your nose?

[02:39:35.358 --> 02:39:37.059]  Don't forget the free iPhone app.

[02:39:51.364 --> 02:39:55.785]  I want to jam in a few final calls here right at the end of the show.
[02:39:55.805 --> 02:39:59.606]  I won't have time to get to more news, unfortunately, but we'll be back tomorrow 11 a.m.
[02:39:59.646 --> 02:40:00.006]  Central.
[02:40:01.226 --> 02:40:09.668]  In thanking some of the sponsors that made today's radio show possible, one of them is eFoodsDirect.com, the premier storable foods company out there in America.
[02:40:09.688 --> 02:40:14.869]  And they've got a really good special running now where you buy so many
[02:40:16.741 --> 02:40:18.002]  Meals and get some free.
[02:40:18.022 --> 02:40:19.543]  They've got a bunch of other specials.
[02:40:19.563 --> 02:40:20.743]  They've got ready-to-eat meals.
[02:40:21.144 --> 02:40:22.284]  They've got so much there.
[02:40:23.245 --> 02:40:24.406]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:40:24.426 --> 02:40:26.427]  Just the letter eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:40:26.447 --> 02:40:29.028]  Big banners up on my websites if you miss it.
[02:40:29.368 --> 02:40:29.509]  Or 800-409-5633.
[02:40:29.529 --> 02:40:35.172]  800-409-5633. eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:40:35.672 --> 02:40:36.213]  Don't forget.
[02:40:36.273 --> 02:40:37.934]  Talk about the Second Amendment gun culture.
[02:40:38.394 --> 02:40:40.475]  Don't forget Front Sight.
[02:40:40.915 --> 02:40:41.976]  FrontSight.com.
[02:40:42.036 --> 02:40:43.057]  At the front of your rifle.
[02:40:43.857 --> 02:40:45.237]  It's not enough to just own firearms.
[02:40:45.978 --> 02:40:49.159]  You can go out to Pahrump, Nevada, and they've got some online stuff, too.
[02:40:49.319 --> 02:40:54.460]  Very inexpensive and get a free firearm with your two, four, five-day training.
[02:40:54.520 --> 02:40:55.701]  They have different packages.
[02:40:56.161 --> 02:41:02.623]  Attend five days of world-class gun training at Frontside Firearms Training and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[02:41:03.263 --> 02:41:10.005]  Plus, if you act fast, the owner will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[02:41:11.004 --> 02:41:11.905]  You can't beat the deal.
[02:41:11.985 --> 02:41:15.188]  Frontsight.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:41:15.628 --> 02:41:20.192]  Before I jam in two final calls, I also wanted to tell you about MySolarBackup.com.
[02:41:21.373 --> 02:41:24.836]  Have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[02:41:24.876 --> 02:41:33.643]  If so, you should check out MySolarBackup.com because there's never been a better time to get started getting off the grid and guarantee you your own supply of electrical power.
[02:41:34.144 --> 02:41:34.724]  Here's why.
[02:41:34.784 --> 02:41:37.126]  Plug and play solar generators from Solutions for Science.
[02:41:37.967 --> 02:41:38.588]  ...are available.
[02:41:38.628 --> 02:41:45.453]  These portable power systems need no installation and supply household current whenever or whatever area they're needed, producing electricity directly from the sun.
[02:41:45.893 --> 02:41:49.156]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly and emits no fumes.
[02:41:49.536 --> 02:41:52.999]  So go to MySolarBackup.com to request a free information package today.
[02:41:53.019 --> 02:41:54.661]  That's MySolarBackup.com or 877-327-0365.
[02:41:54.681 --> 02:41:54.921]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:42:00.425 --> 02:42:02.526]  Again, those sponsors make this show possible and we love them.
[02:42:02.726 --> 02:42:06.647]  Whether it's FrontSite.com or MySolarBackup.com or eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:42:07.167 --> 02:42:10.869]  Let's go ahead and talk to Vinny.
[02:42:11.249 --> 02:42:12.209]  No, no, Pete's up next.
[02:42:12.429 --> 02:42:13.270]  I'll do Pete and Vinny.
[02:42:13.950 --> 02:42:15.610]  Pete, quick comment from North Carolina.
[02:42:16.971 --> 02:42:22.573]  Yeah, Alex, I was just calling about this Airsoft and this idiot from the ATF.
[02:42:23.633 --> 02:42:24.494]  Who is this guy?
[02:42:24.514 --> 02:42:24.954]  Does the ATF
[02:42:27.924 --> 02:42:31.485]  Yes, and he's God.
[02:42:31.545 --> 02:42:35.167]  He says, I'll ban BB guns, I'll ban water guns, I'll ban whatever I want.
[02:42:35.207 --> 02:42:35.727]  I'm God.
[02:42:35.747 --> 02:42:38.369]  That's just unbelievable.
[02:42:38.609 --> 02:42:43.411]  I'm a former law enforcement officer from the 80s and 90s, and this is embarrassing to me.
[02:42:43.431 --> 02:42:47.553]  It's just embarrassing.
[02:42:50.775 --> 02:42:55.357]  I'm 47 years old, and I have the perspective of being able to see
[02:42:56.058 --> 02:43:03.926]  How things used to be, and how it was when I was a cop, and these newer generations, it seems to me it just gets worse and worse and worse.
[02:43:04.467 --> 02:43:13.156]  The abuse of power, the Pittsburgh, I believe it was the G20 Summit, that was horrifying when I saw the videos of that, their behavior.
[02:43:13.736 --> 02:43:19.302]  And that wasn't just individual cops that did that, knowing what they do on the inside, because I was on the inside.
[02:43:19.884 --> 02:43:20.704]  They were briefed.
[02:43:21.065 --> 02:43:24.386]  I mean, that was the department's policy with what those cops were doing.
[02:43:24.406 --> 02:43:38.574]  They were told to go into shopping areas and old women would walk out with bags and say, I can't be on the street and have police dogs attack them or knock women off their bikes or they went to the university to say you can't be outside at the park and people said, I can't be outside.
[02:43:38.894 --> 02:43:40.234]  They want to set that precedent.
[02:43:40.535 --> 02:43:41.255]  God bless you.
[02:43:41.295 --> 02:43:42.636]  We need more people like you.
[02:43:43.436 --> 02:43:46.479]  To be peace officers, too bad most of the good guys are getting out.
[02:43:46.559 --> 02:43:47.119]  God bless you.
[02:43:47.380 --> 02:43:48.321]  Sorry to the other callers.
[02:43:48.421 --> 02:43:49.582]  Retransmission starts now.
[02:43:49.622 --> 02:43:50.663]  Infowars.com.
[02:43:50.983 --> 02:43:52.585]  Great job, crew!
[02:43:54.546 --> 02:43:55.808]  You are listening to GCN.
