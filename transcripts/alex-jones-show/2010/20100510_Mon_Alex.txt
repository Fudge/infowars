[00:00:05.542 --> 00:00:06.182]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.843 --> 00:00:07.903]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.604 --> 00:00:09.765]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:11.186]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:12.987]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.507 --> 00:00:17.349]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.433]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.353 --> 00:00:27.336]  Well, Gordon Brown, the British Prime Minister, has just announced he's going to step down.
[00:00:30.745 --> 00:00:35.412]  They are announcing also to the country that the government is going to stop fixing roads and sidewalks now.
[00:00:35.632 --> 00:00:41.722]  Everything will go on interest to bankers that have designed this financial implosion of the global economy.
[00:00:41.782 --> 00:00:43.264]  We have the Goldman Sachs emails.
[00:00:43.725 --> 00:00:44.886]  We know it's premeditated.
[00:00:46.539 --> 00:01:02.625]  I put out two films on this last year, documenting everything that was going to unfold with Max Keiser and Webster Tarpley and many others, all the Republican, of course the Obama deception, explaining how they control both parties, where this parasite economy is going.
[00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:06.208]  First, it's $150 billion for Greece.
[00:01:06.688 --> 00:01:07.849]  Not for Greece, for the bankers.
[00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:09.831]  They've got to give up half their pension funds at least.
[00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:13.213]  Then it's $600 billion.
[00:01:13.253 --> 00:01:14.074]  Now it's a trillion.
[00:01:14.114 --> 00:01:15.855]  Now they're saying maybe it'll be more than a trillion.
[00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:17.536]  They won't say where the money's going.
[00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:22.220]  Merkel just lost most of her seats in Germany.
[00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.023]  And so the bankers are accelerating this before their governments are all thrown out.
[00:01:29.225 --> 00:01:31.307]  Nicholas Karzose, all the rest of them.
[00:01:31.327 --> 00:01:32.107]  I can't even say his name.
[00:01:32.147 --> 00:01:32.828]  I'm so upset.
[00:01:36.624 --> 00:01:54.790]  It is just, what is happening is so big that I can hardly even articulate how incredible this is, and how we've known they were going to do this, and how this is just the next step with all these new VAT and carbon taxes meant to destroy the economy.
[00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.032]  LA Times last week reported, oh, we raised all these taxes in California, tax receipts went down.
[00:02:00.552 --> 00:02:01.933]  Of course, they know it does that.
[00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:04.473]  Nicholas Carzozzi, can't even say it today.
[00:02:05.634 --> 00:02:06.134]  Sarkozy.
[00:02:08.587 --> 00:02:13.113]  So with us is Max Keiser for the rest of the hour.
[00:02:13.153 --> 00:02:17.860]  I appreciate him coming on on short notice with what's happening with the economy.
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.024]  And again, tensions simmer as Greece readies pension reform.
[00:02:25.444 --> 00:02:38.153]  This is out of the French news agency, and it says protesters rallied in Athens on Sunday as the government sought to rein in social tensions while pressing ahead with drastic austerity measures aimed at avoiding a debt default.
[00:02:38.413 --> 00:02:43.437]  That means more taxes, taking your 401Ks, taking your pensions, and it announces it all here.
[00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.872]  But they've had all these secret bank conferences.
[00:02:47.912 --> 00:02:49.753]  They're not saying where this trillion's going.
[00:02:50.334 --> 00:02:56.078]  How does it tie into the financial terrorism of the market dropping a thousand points last Thursday in five minutes?
[00:02:56.878 --> 00:03:08.226]  Max Keiser, inventor of the Hollywood Stock Exchange System, a successful broker, author, television host on BBC, Al Jazeera, RT, Press TV, the list goes on and on.
[00:03:08.926 --> 00:03:12.208]  He is now here with us to discuss all of this.
[00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:14.310]  Max Keiser, good to have you with us.
[00:03:15.134 --> 00:03:24.658]  Good to be back, Alex Jones, and let's remember May 6th, 2010, a day that will live in infamy.
[00:03:25.098 --> 00:03:30.741]  This was the first unequivocal domestic financial attack in America.
[00:03:31.921 --> 00:03:37.023]  Financial terrorist attack, unequivocal, domestic, first of its kind in America.
[00:03:39.364 --> 00:03:40.125]  Break down that.
[00:03:40.265 --> 00:03:42.786]  Break down who are the terrorists, how they did it.
[00:03:44.462 --> 00:03:51.567]  Well, in Washington, there was a bill circulating to break up the too-big-to-fail banks.
[00:03:52.507 --> 00:04:03.495]  Of course, the banks don't want to break up their monopolies, so they exercised, they conducted, they used weapons of mass financial destruction.
[00:04:03.815 --> 00:04:08.198]  They destroyed 1,000 points, a trillion dollars worth of equity on the market.
[00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:27.294]  When it looked like the coast was clear and Congress decided that they were not going to vote for anything that would break up the banks, then they allowed the markets to come back and they rewarded the Congress people, who of course own a lot of stocks and bank stocks themselves.
[00:04:27.894 --> 00:04:28.154]  I think so.
[00:04:57.675 --> 00:04:58.251]  We're good to go.
[00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:06.372]  Yeah, let's walk through the mechanics of it, and then we have all these internal emails of Goldman Sachs where they're involved in other financial terror.
[00:05:06.392 --> 00:05:07.512]  We know this is their policy.
[00:05:07.552 --> 00:05:15.353]  We know Paulson went in and said, there will be martial law if you don't give us these trillions of dollars in October of 2008, when the Congress wouldn't do it.
[00:05:15.473 --> 00:05:27.216]  They went out on TV, the New York Fed head, the Fed chairman, the Treasury Secretary, all Goldman Sachs alumni, and they came out and they said, we are going to have a depression, and so they used fear
[00:05:27.816 --> 00:05:45.490]  to have the public poll out and drive it down this time and that's what the other experts are saying this was not a fat finger they admit this was not a mistake now this was insider using the plunge protection team uh... to artificially drive down the market physical financial terrorism not just using
[00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:53.235]  You know, bad-mouthing like the head of the Rothschilds did by claiming that Napoleon had won at Waterloo, which was a lie.
[00:05:53.596 --> 00:05:55.277]  That's similar to what happened in 2008.
[00:05:56.057 --> 00:06:00.481]  You're saying this was done physically in there.
[00:06:00.521 --> 00:06:01.782]  Let's go over the mechanics of this.
[00:06:04.048 --> 00:06:15.432]  So on the New York Stock Exchange, there are tens of millions, hundreds of millions of shares that trade daily, and 70% of that is conducted by computers.
[00:06:15.872 --> 00:06:22.895]  So computers are trading effectively with themselves, back and forth over these computer networks.
[00:06:23.315 --> 00:06:32.919]  Now for the most part, the trading is somewhat benign, but the key concept here to understand is that because 70% of it are computer-to-computer trading,
[00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:34.400]  I think so.
[00:06:53.119 --> 00:07:08.311]  If you want to move the price of the stock up or down, and you control 70% of the volume, you have the ability to nudge prices up or down by simply increasing the number of buys over sells that you're making from computer to computer.
[00:07:08.371 --> 00:07:14.056]  If you want the prices to go down, you increase the number of sells to buys from computer to computer.
[00:07:14.316 --> 00:07:19.060]  The cost is zero, because the cost of borrowing money for Wall Street is zero.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:25.061]  The cost of transacting is zero, and it doesn't cost them anything to engage in this.
[00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:32.263]  That's one of the reasons why interest rates keep them near zero, is because you have to be able to conduct this type of thing without having any cost.
[00:07:32.903 --> 00:07:48.986]  Now, the second step is when you get the price of a security, like an S&P futures contract or an S&P security, which is based on the entire market, you know, it's a proxy for the entire market, it's a price signal.
[00:07:49.944 --> 00:07:58.732]  And this price signal triggers a response from those hundreds of thousands of day traders out there, who then do your dirty work for you.
[00:07:59.372 --> 00:08:12.063]  So, when the price trigger is established, let's say you can move the price up 2 or 3%, and it pops up on everyone's Bloomberg machine, and every day trader in the world sees, oh my gosh, there's a 2% move.
[00:08:12.403 --> 00:08:16.347]  Suddenly the trend momentum players, and these mom-and-poppers, and these day traders,
[00:08:16.747 --> 00:08:17.367]  We're good to go.
[00:08:34.452 --> 00:08:43.701]  And of course, this gives them a great way to cover their tracks because they can say, well, you know, we didn't, it wasn't us, it was those day traders out there, it was the market, it wasn't us.
[00:08:44.962 --> 00:08:49.186]  Meanwhile, once the deed is done, in this case, with Congress
[00:08:50.498 --> 00:08:50.718]  I think so.
[00:09:06.458 --> 00:09:10.061]  The buying orders come in, and effectively they refill the piñata.
[00:09:10.241 --> 00:09:13.703]  That's what that rally was about at the end of the day, Thursdays.
[00:09:13.923 --> 00:09:24.591]  Refilling the piñata so that next week, if Congress decides to come again and say, you know what, we want to break you guys up, we want to attack, we want to get rid of high-frequency trading, they can just do the same thing over again.
[00:09:24.611 --> 00:09:27.813]  This is just now blatant.
[00:09:28.453 --> 00:09:30.935]  It's easy, it's costless, it's very effective.
[00:09:33.311 --> 00:09:40.382]  Now, we know the Plunge Protection Team set up by Reagan in 87 has its fingers in the market and admittedly can control it.
[00:09:40.783 --> 00:09:45.050]  They're in the AP today saying, oh, we're pumping the market up.
[00:09:46.787 --> 00:09:53.431]  Okay, is the name given to what's called a Working Group on Finance that was set up the day after the October 19th crash of 1987.
[00:09:53.511 --> 00:09:55.492]  I was working on Wall Street at the time.
[00:09:55.832 --> 00:10:15.122]  Bob Rubin, Alan Greenspan, Ronald Reagan created the Working Group on Finance and the Tuesday, this is October 20th, 1987, the government bought S&P futures contracts to save America because the day after the crash of 87, it looked like there was going to be another crash, which every bank in the
[00:10:16.693 --> 00:10:20.897]  And so the power to save, the power to save is the power to destroy.
[00:10:21.377 --> 00:10:24.660]  Now they're using it to engage in financial terrorism.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.442]  Well, they gave them that tool.
[00:10:26.722 --> 00:10:38.593]  The government, they gave the government that tool to buy and sell market contracts, which is, in my opinion, that marks the beginning of the end of free market capitalism in terms of
[00:10:39.233 --> 00:10:39.814]  We're good to go.
[00:10:54.506 --> 00:10:54.927]  We're good to go.
[00:11:17.608 --> 00:11:18.288]  We're good to go.
[00:11:47.046 --> 00:11:53.877]  The central government is bringing about all of these extraordinary extra-legal measures to put people in jail.
[00:11:53.897 --> 00:11:55.300]  Alright Max, got a break.
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:55.700]  Stay there.

[00:14:02.818 --> 00:14:04.219]  Today is May 10th, 2010.
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.821]  Gold opened at $11.9610 this morning.

[00:15:03.471 --> 00:15:05.692]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:15:06.012 --> 00:15:07.833]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:15:08.094 --> 00:15:09.294]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:15:09.695 --> 00:15:12.896]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:15:13.297 --> 00:15:18.160]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.842]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:15:22.335 --> 00:15:23.676]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:15:24.016 --> 00:15:26.619]  Wild food grows everywhere, and you will see it everywhere.
[00:15:26.879 --> 00:15:29.841]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:15:30.181 --> 00:15:38.368]  Well-respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.

[00:16:08.481 --> 00:16:11.603]  Also, George Humphrey, economist, in studio with us in the next hour.
[00:16:11.623 --> 00:16:14.705]  MaxKeiser.com is his website.
[00:16:14.725 --> 00:16:18.227]  My websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:16:19.028 --> 00:16:20.749]  We've got continual coverage of what's happening.
[00:16:21.029 --> 00:16:23.771]  We haven't even gotten into what's happening in Europe and Greece.
[00:16:24.271 --> 00:16:26.973]  What will Angela Merkel, what will Nicolas Sarkozy do?
[00:16:27.433 --> 00:16:29.534]  Why has Gordon Brown been forced to step down?
[00:16:29.614 --> 00:16:31.095]  I mean, this is a major shake-up.
[00:16:33.382 --> 00:16:34.864]  I remember that last Thursday.
[00:16:34.884 --> 00:16:38.327]  They were about to pass a bill to stop Too Big to Fail.
[00:16:39.454 --> 00:16:40.775]  A bunch of other things were happening.
[00:16:41.475 --> 00:16:43.996]  Now the bill to audit the Fed is in trouble in the Senate.
[00:16:44.357 --> 00:16:46.578]  All of that did die that afternoon.
[00:16:47.118 --> 00:16:54.482]  And they've now admitted, this is mainstream news, it was not the fat finger, they said they don't know what did it, when clearly that was a manipulation.
[00:16:55.343 --> 00:17:05.308]  So we're going to discuss that, and from the evidence he has as a former trader and somebody who researches this, and as a BBC and Al Jazeera and RT reporter.
[00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:08.750]  Start over, go ahead.
[00:17:09.325 --> 00:17:10.683]  I designed the technology!
[00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:12.250]  Absolutely.
[00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:13.531]  So Max, go over this.
[00:17:13.831 --> 00:17:16.192]  Look, I designed this technology in 1996.
[00:17:16.712 --> 00:17:28.978]  There are 132 patents that reference my patent, the Virtual Specialist Patent 5950176 for making markets with an infinite inventory for price parity across virtual securities.
[00:17:29.518 --> 00:17:30.919]  I created this concept.
[00:17:31.319 --> 00:17:37.702]  Now, Goldman Sachs, when they do it, when they commit this fraud, they say they're making a market.
[00:17:37.902 --> 00:17:39.343]  That's the code word for
[00:17:39.403 --> 00:17:39.964]  I'm good.
[00:17:55.342 --> 00:17:55.822]  I think so.
[00:18:12.834 --> 00:18:21.096]  The only thing that keeps people from putting this guy in jail is because if they do, they have to face themselves in the mirror and realize that they live in a financial hologram.
[00:18:21.316 --> 00:18:24.157]  There's nothing, there's no basis for it.
[00:18:24.217 --> 00:18:25.918]  It's complete bull.
[00:18:27.858 --> 00:18:28.818]  It was bizarre.
[00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:35.340]  The host of NBC Nightly News came out and said none of the money's real on Letterman last week.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.901]  And he basically called it a hologram.
[00:18:38.321 --> 00:18:41.062]  But Max, you've called all this with precision.
[00:18:41.082 --> 00:18:42.202]  That's why I keep pointing that out.
[00:18:44.088 --> 00:18:44.469]  I think so.
[00:19:00.347 --> 00:19:01.848]  So now they're going... Hold on, Max.
[00:19:23.186 --> 00:19:23.366]  I'm good.
[00:19:43.717 --> 00:19:49.102]  Max, I want to go over this point by point and talk about what's happening currently in Europe and the trillion dollars.
[00:19:49.162 --> 00:19:53.687]  It goes from $150 billion to $600 billion to a trillion in the space of three days.
[00:19:53.807 --> 00:19:54.728]  What's behind that?
[00:19:55.508 --> 00:19:57.250]  What these European leaders are going to do?
[00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:00.633]  What the bankers are going to do next to try to keep control of this?
[00:20:00.673 --> 00:20:03.956]  But to quantify what you're saying in layman's terms, and correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:20:04.557 --> 00:20:34.217]  They're transcending fractional reserve banking of you got one dollar the bank can loan out nine or ten to just absolute derivative universe where they bankrupt the world by design, they create the new global currency, they announce their world government as they're now doing and saying all of you must capitulate and kneel to Zod like Superman kneeling to Zod or we will just destroy everything and have a total depression and we're now held in complete hostage to these people.
[00:20:34.697 --> 00:20:35.198]  Right.
[00:20:35.458 --> 00:20:41.923]  The denominator in a fractional reserve system, as you just described it, is now zero.
[00:20:44.225 --> 00:20:56.776]  So they're God, magic checkbook, they're passing all these taxes in their own documents to bankrupt us even further, and then we give them all the real assets for just made-up baloney.
[00:20:56.796 --> 00:21:02.461]  I mean, this is... and they want to destroy the economy, because they're in competition.
[00:21:04.771 --> 00:21:08.312]  And 40 million Americans now on food stamps, up from 33 million a month ago.
[00:21:08.332 --> 00:21:10.553]  Those are the new red lines.
[00:21:10.573 --> 00:21:11.434]  Stay there, Max.
[00:21:11.454 --> 00:21:12.394]  Long segment coming up.
[00:21:32.581 --> 00:21:41.443]  It's just so amazing to be living this and to know that the average yuppie still only cares about basketball scores tonight, when their whole future is destroyed.
[00:21:41.463 --> 00:21:47.165]  I want to talk about how their next phase, what's happening in Europe, and how you think we beat them.
[00:21:47.585 --> 00:21:49.265]  Max Keiser is our guest.
[00:21:49.385 --> 00:21:50.345]  We'll be right back.
[00:21:50.765 --> 00:21:51.686]  We're on the march.
[00:21:52.166 --> 00:21:53.766]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:54.706 --> 00:21:57.367]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.581]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:22:05.901 --> 00:22:14.022]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:22:14.762 --> 00:22:18.803]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:22:19.383 --> 00:22:30.205]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:22:30.845 --> 00:22:39.853]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:22:40.374 --> 00:22:45.398]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[00:23:04.102 --> 00:23:05.003]  Tyranny is here.
[00:23:05.363 --> 00:23:09.066]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:23:09.086 --> 00:23:11.488]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:23:11.508 --> 00:23:16.952]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:23:17.392 --> 00:23:23.617]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:23:24.057 --> 00:23:29.601]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:23:30.021 --> 00:23:33.724]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:23:34.204 --> 00:23:38.207]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:23:38.487 --> 00:23:44.392]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:23:44.432 --> 00:23:47.434]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:23:47.994 --> 00:23:49.435]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:23:49.975 --> 00:23:50.396]  It's here.

[00:24:11.987 --> 00:24:18.671]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:24:20.714 --> 00:24:36.856]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit They put a diamond gusset in the crotch Where you need it most Blue diamond gussets got it
[00:24:37.646 --> 00:24:38.467]  Others don't.
[00:24:38.847 --> 00:24:40.748]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:24:41.009 --> 00:24:42.510]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:45.352]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:24:45.672 --> 00:24:49.735]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.

[00:24:54.999 --> 00:24:57.040]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:24:57.381 --> 00:24:57.881]  Others don't.
[00:25:15.117 --> 00:25:19.767]  This was financial terrorism, a false flag attack just like 2008.
[00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:24.171]  In 2008, they used fear to drive the market down.
[00:25:24.211 --> 00:25:27.093]  This time, they did it digitally, with their hands in there.
[00:25:27.253 --> 00:25:34.257]  I'm going to ask Kaiser, how do we investigate it when all the major federal regulators are openly former JPMorgan Chase or Goldman Sachs?
[00:25:35.178 --> 00:25:38.840]  Meanwhile, Ron Paul, Euro bailout will lead to currency collapse.
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.841]  Congressman Bernanke broke promises that U.S.
[00:25:41.881 --> 00:25:44.983]  taxpayer dollars would not be sent to European banks.
[00:25:45.043 --> 00:25:49.566]  I want to take calls coming up for Max Kaiser, your questions specifically for him.
[00:25:50.026 --> 00:25:50.266]  1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[00:25:50.286 --> 00:25:54.070]  But they are wrecking the economy by design, waging war against the real economy.
[00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:55.852]  We'll put that headline up there, 40 million people
[00:26:06.423 --> 00:26:14.608]  Now on food stamps, Los Angeles and others announcing they're not going to basically fix roads or sidewalks anymore.
[00:26:15.189 --> 00:26:19.491]  They're announcing all over the country that police are only there to write you tickets, not to respond to crime.
[00:26:19.892 --> 00:26:25.535]  Sheriffs in Texas and Ohio are saying, buy guns, we can't protect you, all we're allowed to do is raise money now.
[00:26:26.096 --> 00:26:30.839]  At least they have some moral compass, at least admitting they're just pirates now.
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.441]  It is just unbelievable.
[00:26:34.801 --> 00:26:37.763]  Max Keiser is our guest, one of our top financial experts.
[00:26:38.564 --> 00:26:42.186]  Max, I want to go through questions quickly for you now here.
[00:26:43.387 --> 00:26:48.130]  Specifically, who are the culprits of the financial terrorism?
[00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:52.893]  A. Let's then look at what's happening in Europe and how that's tied to this.
[00:26:53.514 --> 00:26:57.617]  And now they're admitting, even in the Associated Press, the euro may collapse.
[00:26:58.337 --> 00:27:01.800]  But the bankers aren't going to let that happen because that's their looting mechanism.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:02.180]  Go ahead.
[00:27:03.814 --> 00:27:19.675]  Well, clearly in the area of financial terrorism and market manipulation, high frequency trading and program trading, one name stands above the rest.
[00:27:20.968 --> 00:27:37.878]  You know, I mean, Goldman Sachs, they've already been nabbed with the software that they said, yes, you can use it to manipulate markets, and they said it's a proprietary piece of software and they don't want it out in the public domain when one of their defectors was caught crossing the border, I think it was into Canada.
[00:27:38.418 --> 00:27:48.904]  They also openly discuss that they have a server that they've installed next to the New York Stock Exchange down there on Wall Street, which siphons off up to $100 million a day in cash by front-running
[00:27:49.464 --> 00:27:52.525]  Which is another aspect of the high frequency trading financial terrorism.
[00:27:52.945 --> 00:28:03.789]  They, in the last quarter, they just reported, Goldman Sachs reported that their primary business of trading, they did not experience a single day
[00:28:04.874 --> 00:28:06.296]  I don't know.
[00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:27.317]  That is quite obviously not a normal situation, and that's quite obviously market manipulation.
[00:28:27.737 --> 00:28:31.081]  Now, who's supposed to be looking at this type of stuff?
[00:28:31.121 --> 00:28:33.664]  Well, you've got Moody's, one of the rating agencies.
[00:28:33.844 --> 00:28:34.385]  Well, guess what?
[00:28:34.405 --> 00:28:36.668]  The SEC just sent them a wealth notice.
[00:28:37.308 --> 00:28:39.410]  Telling them that they're under investigation.
[00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:40.530]  Oh, and guess what?
[00:28:40.751 --> 00:28:48.736]  The day that they got the Wells Notice that they're now under investigation, Warren Buffett and the CEO of Moody's sold out of their stock.
[00:28:49.056 --> 00:28:54.240]  Oh, I guess those guys are also insider traders and market manipulators and financial terrorists.
[00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.321]  Yeah, let's put them on the cover of Time Magazine.
[00:28:56.341 --> 00:28:58.562]  They're certainly heroes in the American economy.
[00:28:58.582 --> 00:29:00.964]  They're driving the entire economy into the ditch.
[00:29:01.444 --> 00:29:01.684]  Okay?
[00:29:01.925 --> 00:29:02.685]  So who else?
[00:29:02.705 --> 00:29:03.566]  The CFTC?
[00:29:03.846 --> 00:29:06.668]  They just got compelling evidence that there's a rampant
[00:29:06.988 --> 00:29:07.348]  We're good to go.
[00:29:35.788 --> 00:29:36.229]  I don't know.
[00:29:50.675 --> 00:29:51.836]  We're good to go.
[00:30:07.746 --> 00:30:11.908]  Which is illegal, which is what Goldman Sachs is in trouble for on Timberwolf.
[00:30:12.268 --> 00:30:13.429]  But let me just stop you there.
[00:30:13.949 --> 00:30:16.550]  Because rarely am I at a loss for words.
[00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:19.891]  I could hardly talk, Max, during the first hour.
[00:30:19.971 --> 00:30:22.973]  I'm having trouble forming words right now.
[00:30:23.853 --> 00:30:27.815]  And the reason I'm making this statement is this fraud is so
[00:30:28.915 --> 00:30:52.811]  Off-the-charge gargantuan that I can't even wrap my mind around how bold these people are and it scares me at a fundamental level to know that they could set off nukes and blame it on people to launch new wars, they could release bioweapons, they could stage terror attacks and blame it on Patriot groups, which they're clearly conditioning the public for, that they're not going away, they're not going to stop.
[00:30:53.152 --> 00:30:56.374]  This is a hot revolution by the private banking cartels.
[00:30:56.914 --> 00:31:04.279]  That only have the quote open stock market as a way to swindle people and to feed their operation.
[00:31:04.619 --> 00:31:14.465]  They're imploding Europe now and now all the experts I talked to aren't saying a year or two till we go into full total collapse, but maybe even sooner.
[00:31:14.485 --> 00:31:17.227]  So let's now, we've talked about what's going on over here.
[00:31:18.047 --> 00:31:24.829]  And then simultaneously, with no debate, no news coverage really, they just say, yeah, it's not $150 billion, it's a trillion.
[00:31:25.049 --> 00:31:26.649]  Now they're saying it may be $2 trillion.
[00:31:27.089 --> 00:31:31.871]  They're saying, just like here in our Congress, they won't tell these governments where the money's going.
[00:31:32.271 --> 00:31:36.772]  It's just, we wake up, private central banks through the G20 run everything, and they say,
[00:31:37.392 --> 00:31:38.793]  We're taking your pension funds.
[00:31:39.073 --> 00:31:40.214]  We're taking everything.
[00:31:40.474 --> 00:31:42.695]  And the SWAT teams are standing by if you don't like it.
[00:31:43.235 --> 00:31:47.298]  And you've got a bunch of Bernie Madoff, Ken Lay types that are hundreds of times worse.
[00:31:49.599 --> 00:31:51.280]  They own the intelligence agencies.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.321]  They run everything.
[00:31:53.373 --> 00:31:55.094]  Let me simplify, because I'm just ranting here.
[00:31:55.275 --> 00:31:56.776]  I mean, I'm trying to even get my mind around this.
[00:31:58.017 --> 00:31:58.977]  What's happening in Europe?
[00:31:59.078 --> 00:32:00.158]  How does it tie into this?
[00:32:00.238 --> 00:32:01.299]  And what's their game plan?
[00:32:01.319 --> 00:32:02.700]  What do you see happening, Max Keiser?
[00:32:03.101 --> 00:32:13.269]  Okay, well, in Europe, they have just gone through the credit collapse that America experienced in 2008, and have finally caught up to the European banking system.
[00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:17.212]  And similarly to what we saw in the United States,
[00:32:18.974 --> 00:32:25.099]  Banking system got overextended in this whole derivatives market, which is just a fancy way to say debt.
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:32.606]  And the European banks got way in over their head with hundreds of billions and trillions of dollars worth of debt.
[00:32:33.006 --> 00:32:33.907]  Now here's the funny bit.
[00:32:34.984 --> 00:32:41.106]  All of this derivatives, all this debt in Europe is priced or manufactured in dollars.
[00:32:41.907 --> 00:32:53.731]  So in order to extricate the banks, in order for them to unwind themselves, to get out of the corner that they've painted themselves into, the United States just sent Europe a trillion US dollars in exchange for some euros.
[00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:59.592]  Because that's the only way they can unwind their problems because they're all priced in dollars.
[00:32:59.972 --> 00:33:06.075]  So they needed a trillion dollars just so they could unwrap themselves from all this bad debt that they put themselves in.
[00:33:06.395 --> 00:33:08.896]  And in doing so, America just gave them a trillion dollars.
[00:33:09.096 --> 00:33:10.517]  No congressional review?
[00:33:11.657 --> 00:33:14.039]  No conversation, no debate.
[00:33:14.299 --> 00:33:30.190]  They just signed a check for a trillion dollars in exchange for some euros, which of course is just another fiat currency, which is manufactured by another European central bank, another central bank, which just loans money into existence out of thin air with no, as the German Chancellor said, we just lend money with no collateral whatsoever.
[00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:40.818]  So they just did basically a swap of a trillion in worthless dollars for a trillion or less in euros, just so that the banks could on paper say that they were unwinding from
[00:33:41.138 --> 00:33:42.339]  That was this part of the...
[00:34:01.666 --> 00:34:25.002]  Big problems, and gold keeps hitting new highs against the euro, against the pound, every single major currency in the world except the dollar, which it'll hit a new high again shortly, but the gold vigilantes are saying, oh, wait a minute, buddy, you know, you just can't put trillions of dollars in thin air to help your banker buddies without at some point totally debasing that currency, and this is what's driving gold.
[00:34:26.274 --> 00:34:50.239]  But Max, specifically, this is by design, I remember reading Trilateral Commission documents from the seventies, how they plan to create three global currencies, a Euro, a dollarized North American Union, an Asian Unified Currency, then currency wars between those, and then the answer to the crisis they had created will be this global cashless society
[00:34:50.799 --> 00:34:51.740]  Well, I think they're moving...
[00:35:05.816 --> 00:35:06.036]  Right.
[00:35:37.617 --> 00:35:38.498]  Clearly, clearly.
[00:35:38.578 --> 00:35:49.905]  So what's going to happen politically as Germany and France and England and Portugal and Spain and Greece are all... Very simple.
[00:35:50.145 --> 00:35:52.307]  You're going to see a global tax.
[00:35:53.287 --> 00:35:53.968]  A world tax.
[00:35:54.028 --> 00:35:56.809]  You're going to have to pay a tax to the U.S.
[00:35:56.950 --> 00:36:01.272]  and the Global Central Bank and your local municipality and your state.
[00:36:01.292 --> 00:36:05.215]  So you're going to pay local, state, federal and world tax.
[00:36:06.109 --> 00:36:15.943]  And they've all announced this, that was going to be their carbon tax, and this global VAT they're calling the fat tax, but I go back to the rest of my question.
[00:36:16.764 --> 00:36:21.911]  If it's so politically unpopular to take people's pension funds,
[00:36:22.592 --> 00:36:33.320]  And to put taxes on their cars and their food and everything else to give it to criminal bankers who made all this debt up out of nothing and Merkel almost lost control of her parliament.
[00:36:34.101 --> 00:36:40.265]  Sarkozy a few months ago dumped the carbon tax because he almost lost control in the French government.
[00:36:41.146 --> 00:36:44.409]  All these, I mean everywhere, Gordon Brown just had to step down.
[00:36:44.769 --> 00:36:46.890]  This is political suicide.
[00:36:47.271 --> 00:36:50.093]  So what are the bankers going to do to get this through?
[00:36:51.206 --> 00:36:53.767]  We're going to use more financial terrorism, like we saw on Thursday.
[00:36:56.828 --> 00:37:08.612]  And so, they keep saying, give us whatever we want, or there'll be a depression, as they walk us in to an austerity depression that's meant to be a financial poverty straitjacket.
[00:37:09.633 --> 00:37:13.814]  Alex, last Thursday, the stock in Accenture went from $48 to a penny in 15 minutes.
[00:37:16.883 --> 00:37:18.785]  So they can just do whatever they want?
[00:37:18.805 --> 00:37:21.807]  Why are the bankers a thousand times more criminal than they've ever been?
[00:37:21.867 --> 00:37:22.788]  I mean, I've never...
[00:37:36.758 --> 00:37:40.722]  This moral hazard has become the de facto business model of America and the world.
[00:37:40.922 --> 00:37:42.223]  There's no safeguard.
[00:37:42.243 --> 00:37:43.184]  There's no pushback.
[00:37:43.224 --> 00:37:44.285]  There's no regulation.
[00:37:44.485 --> 00:37:45.726]  There's nobody stopping them.
[00:37:45.786 --> 00:37:46.386]  It's a cancer.
[00:37:46.407 --> 00:37:47.588]  It's out of control.
[00:37:47.628 --> 00:37:48.648]  There's nothing stopping it.
[00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:54.113]  Ron Paul and others are saying the Euro will now die within the next year.
[00:37:54.133 --> 00:37:54.914]  Do you agree with that?
[00:37:56.035 --> 00:37:57.516]  All fiat currencies are going to die.
[00:37:57.636 --> 00:37:59.238]  The only question is in what order?
[00:38:01.199 --> 00:38:02.260]  What will be the last standing?
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:02.661]  The dollar?
[00:38:05.643 --> 00:38:12.164]  Well, you know, I could give you my speculation about that, but it's pointless.
[00:38:12.684 --> 00:38:22.386]  You just have to break through, even trying to figure out how many angels are going to end up on the head of that worthless pin and just buy gold.
[00:38:25.527 --> 00:38:27.247]  Well, I just can't believe it's come to this.
[00:38:27.407 --> 00:38:29.808]  I mean, these guys have really got a lot of chutzpah, don't they?
[00:38:31.604 --> 00:38:36.667]  Well, it's, you know, economics is a social science.
[00:38:36.827 --> 00:38:37.868]  It's not a natural science.
[00:38:37.948 --> 00:38:40.350]  People like to think it's like physics, it's like chemistry.
[00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:40.730]  It's not.
[00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.991]  It's psychological.
[00:38:42.431 --> 00:38:49.275]  And we know from psychological experiments, when you give people the option to terrorize other people, they become terrorists.
[00:38:49.796 --> 00:38:56.280]  And you see this time and time again with experimentations, where you give people petty authority to run a jail.
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:59.502]  This was done on campuses several times, you know, the famous experiments.
[00:38:59.902 --> 00:39:00.242]  I don't know.
[00:39:22.904 --> 00:39:24.606]  And that's what our founding... Megalomania.
[00:39:47.679 --> 00:39:56.787]  Clearly, though, because it's a global system, they can loot one country or one region at a time while they're off in their armored fortresses.
[00:39:56.807 --> 00:39:58.188]  You can tell who the real government is.
[00:39:58.508 --> 00:40:02.812]  When a president or somebody comes to town, there's a small detachment of security, comparatively a few hundred.
[00:40:03.212 --> 00:40:05.714]  When the G20 comes, it's the army.
[00:40:06.174 --> 00:40:07.195]  It's 25,000 police.
[00:40:07.636 --> 00:40:09.417]  It's no free speech in the city.
[00:40:09.717 --> 00:40:12.900]  It's police dogs attacking old women coming out of grocery stores.
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:15.042]  It's, we're God, we're gonna...
[00:40:15.402 --> 00:40:22.845]  What did you think of the IMF head in the Washington Post saying, the good times are over and laughing at people and saying, we're gonna screw you.
[00:40:23.166 --> 00:40:33.790]  I mean, they are just such arrogant creatures and they really think they're gonna get away with it because they don't care if Greece burns, they don't care if Germany burns, they don't even care if the US burns.
[00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:36.111]  They will use that as a way to consolidate things.
[00:40:36.131 --> 00:40:39.473]  We have that in the IMF documents, how they create the IMF riots.
[00:40:39.753 --> 00:40:41.034]  So how do you beat them?
[00:40:41.414 --> 00:40:43.895]  How do you beat a group of criminals that have
[00:40:44.515 --> 00:40:51.979]  Millions and millions of paramilitary police working for him that can't even balance their checkbook and bow down to anybody with a bald head in a suit.
[00:40:53.100 --> 00:41:04.166]  Well, I know how you can beat them, but I'm interested to hear you try to convince me that my way to beat them is unworkable, because I think it is workable.
[00:41:04.186 --> 00:41:09.349]  Okay, we try to shoot down Coca-Cola legally by going after its stock.
[00:41:09.609 --> 00:41:12.871]  They just breathe more fiat billions into it.
[00:41:13.831 --> 00:41:14.392]  But here's the thing.
[00:41:15.094 --> 00:41:24.814]  If, in fact, Coca-Cola, which is a, um, I believe now it's roughly $50 or $60 billion, or maybe a higher billion dollar company, it's biggest shareholder is Warren Buffett.
[00:41:25.918 --> 00:41:27.759]  And, um, it's clearly an icon.
[00:41:27.799 --> 00:41:28.379]  It's global.
[00:41:28.419 --> 00:41:31.661]  It's a global currency, like the yen, the dollar, gold.
[00:41:31.841 --> 00:41:33.222]  Coca-Cola is sold everywhere.
[00:41:33.262 --> 00:41:35.423]  Somali pirates deal in Coca-Cola.
[00:41:35.443 --> 00:41:37.364]  Coca-Cola is the only currency in Somalia.
[00:41:37.404 --> 00:41:37.924]  Did you know that?
[00:41:37.964 --> 00:41:45.767]  That the tankers off the Somali coast that have Coke syrup, their major distribution point in Africa, that's the central bank of Somalia, is Coke syrup.
[00:41:46.348 --> 00:41:47.989]  And it's the world's cheapest.
[00:41:48.089 --> 00:41:49.309]  It's the poor man's gold.
[00:41:49.769 --> 00:41:54.652]  Now, if you can boycott Coca-Cola products to the point where that stock goes to zero,
[00:41:55.892 --> 00:41:58.175]  Believe me, you're going to get people's attention.
[00:41:58.495 --> 00:42:02.619]  People are going to be frightened of you instead of you having to be frightened of them.
[00:42:02.699 --> 00:42:10.567]  Because it shows them that the power has shifted from the way that they do business... So it's like Washington winning at Trenton.
[00:42:10.607 --> 00:42:12.990]  It was a minor battle, but it showed we could win.
[00:42:14.309 --> 00:42:17.272]  First of all, yeah, okay, I'll go with that, but it's not a minor battle.
[00:42:17.312 --> 00:42:18.994]  It's pretty significant.
[00:42:19.234 --> 00:42:20.635]  It's a Dow Jones stock.
[00:42:21.196 --> 00:42:22.317]  It's an icon.
[00:42:22.457 --> 00:42:23.719]  It's owned by Warren Buffett.
[00:42:24.139 --> 00:42:24.840]  It's easy to do.
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:28.644]  It's like Gandhi's march to the sea to make salt.
[00:42:28.744 --> 00:42:29.625]  It's a boycott.
[00:42:29.925 --> 00:42:30.826]  It's easy to do.
[00:42:31.206 --> 00:42:32.788]  It's a no-cost weapon of choice.
[00:42:33.088 --> 00:42:35.511]  And you can tell every single day if you're winning or not.
[00:42:35.811 --> 00:42:36.752]  Look at the price of Coke.
[00:42:36.792 --> 00:42:38.213]  If it's going down, you're winning.
[00:42:38.553 --> 00:42:40.115]  If it's going up, you're losing.
[00:42:40.455 --> 00:42:42.877]  If you take down Coke to zero, then you can move on.
[00:42:42.937 --> 00:42:44.198]  Move on to another company.
[00:42:44.398 --> 00:42:51.404]  And you've got a marble feast of a boycotting army that's going to withdraw their consumer dollar, and they're going to take these stocks down to zero.
[00:42:51.444 --> 00:42:57.509]  When you take the stocks down to zero, everyone working at that company on the executive board is going to get nothing.
[00:42:57.709 --> 00:42:58.210]  Stay there.
[00:42:58.410 --> 00:42:59.150]  He's got a break.
[00:42:59.170 --> 00:42:59.611]  Stay there.
[00:43:01.052 --> 00:43:02.313]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:43:02.353 --> 00:43:07.717]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:43:07.938 --> 00:43:12.561]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:43:12.962 --> 00:43:13.362]  It's true.
[00:43:13.442 --> 00:43:18.026]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:43:18.546 --> 00:43:23.230]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[00:44:01.962 --> 00:44:07.905]  If you have a septic system, did you know that proper maintenance can save you thousands of dollars in costly and unnecessary repairs?

[00:46:13.674 --> 00:46:14.854]  They've all committed crimes.
[00:46:14.915 --> 00:46:15.715]  Just arrest them.
[00:46:16.055 --> 00:46:17.977]  We've got to extricate ourselves out of this.
[00:46:18.657 --> 00:46:26.983]  And if the public was as informed about fractional reserve banking and derivatives as they were about basketball or football, we wouldn't be in this situation.
[00:46:27.003 --> 00:46:28.143]  I was just talking to Max Keiser.
[00:46:28.644 --> 00:46:30.865]  He says it's all going to implode when they steal everything.
[00:46:31.646 --> 00:46:33.467]  And, you know, there's a method to their madness, though.
[00:46:33.487 --> 00:46:40.672]  They plan to replace that with an eco-fascism, neo-feudalistic system, Max Keiser.
[00:46:41.612 --> 00:46:41.933]  Yeah.
[00:46:42.993 --> 00:46:43.694]  Is that a question?
[00:46:44.394 --> 00:46:46.395]  It's a statement, but yeah, you can comment on it.
[00:46:48.437 --> 00:46:56.482]  Well, you know, as I, on the break, I pointed your attention to an article that was written a few years ago when I launched this Coca-Cola boycott.
[00:46:56.502 --> 00:47:04.788]  Because what happens is, if enough people start boycotting Coke, you draw the attention of these hedge funds, who then start selling short Coke.
[00:47:05.448 --> 00:47:09.489]  On behalf of the boycott, because remember, they don't care who they're working for.
[00:47:09.509 --> 00:47:10.670]  They just want to make a quick buck.
[00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:18.012]  If you can leverage the hedge fund community to do the work of you, the humble boycotter, you've turbocharged your boycott.
[00:47:18.032 --> 00:47:34.417]  So instead of now having a few hundred thousand people boycotting Coke, and it might have the impact of subtracting $20 or $30 million from their market capitalization, you're now attracting the hedge funds who are going to subtract $10 or $20 billion from their market capitalization.
[00:47:35.037 --> 00:47:35.357]  I think so.
[00:47:50.026 --> 00:47:50.767]  We're good to go.
[00:48:07.856 --> 00:48:09.876]  I agree with you, and I think that's a good plan.
[00:48:10.237 --> 00:48:12.817]  I also think Grand Jury should start indicting these people.
[00:48:13.157 --> 00:48:15.658]  Marty Madoff founded the Nasdaq, but he wasn't invincible.
[00:48:15.958 --> 00:48:23.480]  We can bring these criminals down by also exposing their criminality and their financial terrorism, which you've done a good job of doing, Max.
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.760]  Jeff in Missouri, you're on the air with Max Keiser.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:26.140]  Go ahead.
[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:27.821]  Good day, gentlemen.
[00:48:28.161 --> 00:48:29.661]  I've got two questions.
[00:48:30.061 --> 00:48:33.162]  First of all, Mr. Keiser, can you explain how
[00:48:33.826 --> 00:48:37.671]  These SDRs are going to replace the dollar.
[00:48:37.691 --> 00:48:40.495]  I know I'm a little bit familiar about SDRs.
[00:48:40.535 --> 00:48:43.740]  They've been around for a while, but exactly what are they?
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:51.310]  And also my second question is, is there any way you can get an article printed up that we can hand out to other people?
[00:48:51.974 --> 00:49:00.257]  On a step-by-step, what happened last week, last Thursday... I've got Paul Watson writing an article right now about what Max said earlier in the hour.
[00:49:00.638 --> 00:49:02.138]  You can also go to MaxKaiser.com.
[00:49:02.158 --> 00:49:04.599]  He's got info on it there, but answer that first question, Max.
[00:49:04.939 --> 00:49:08.561]  Right, so an SDR is, you know, another fiat currency.
[00:49:08.581 --> 00:49:11.102]  It doesn't take anything to create a fiat currency.
[00:49:11.142 --> 00:49:17.204]  You simply say, here is a basket, a unit, a measurement, an accounting unit.
[00:49:17.604 --> 00:49:21.506]  It's going to be based on a basket of other stocks.
[00:49:22.046 --> 00:49:50.791]  Other currencies, and we're going to call it an SDR, a Special Drawing Right, and we're going to recalibrate how the other currencies are weighted in this new basket, this new SDR, and as the global economy starts to, you know, continues to break apart, we'll say, well, because China's actually exporting a lot of stuff and they've got some resources, we'll give them a higher ratio as representation of this SDR, because that'll keep
[00:49:51.572 --> 00:50:04.615]  It's the bankers transcending the nation states they've sucked dry and creating a new 0% fractional reserve banking digital money that will then absorb what's left of sovereignty.
[00:50:06.247 --> 00:50:07.389]  One exists already right now.
[00:50:07.409 --> 00:50:08.850]  It's called a credit default swap.
[00:50:09.051 --> 00:50:21.105]  You know, a credit default swap is a global unit of fraud that banks all over the world swap with each other and they create this back-end unit of currency that they conduct all measure of multi-billion dollar fraud.
[00:50:21.145 --> 00:50:22.306]  And they use it as a weapon.
[00:50:22.326 --> 00:50:24.429]  It's designed to be corrosive.
[00:50:24.649 --> 00:50:25.710]  They want to wreck things.
[00:50:26.431 --> 00:50:27.853]  Well, it's dilutive.
[00:50:28.033 --> 00:50:35.840]  I mean, that's the key to it, is that it dilutes the existing equity that you would associate with a unit of currency.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.061]  Max, back in one minute.
[00:50:37.102 --> 00:50:37.702]  Gotta break.
[00:50:37.742 --> 00:50:39.744]  Man, I could talk for ten hours with Max Geiser.

[00:51:53.283 --> 00:51:55.203]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:55.664 --> 00:51:58.585]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:52:05.087 --> 00:52:05.747]  Big Brother.
[00:52:06.388 --> 00:52:07.348]  Mainstream media.
[00:52:08.155 --> 00:52:09.236]  Government cover-ups.
[00:52:09.916 --> 00:52:10.716]  You want answers?
[00:52:11.497 --> 00:52:12.397]  Well, so does he.
[00:52:13.038 --> 00:52:16.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:21.322]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:52:22.763 --> 00:52:26.244]  It's one thing to intellectually know what the new world order is.
[00:52:27.325 --> 00:52:30.306]  A global government for the administrative convenience for central bankers.
[00:52:30.326 --> 00:52:31.827]  David Rockefeller, 1991, heavy in France.
[00:52:33.877 --> 00:52:47.871]  It is another thing to see it in full practice, and to have laptops watching kids at home in their bedrooms, and FEMA camps being built, and banks stealing trillions, and now it's not even news, it's just, oh, you're mad at 150 billion?
[00:52:47.911 --> 00:52:48.751]  It's a trillion now!
[00:52:49.412 --> 00:52:56.994]  Max Keiser has agreed to stay with us about five minutes in the next segment, then George Humphrey will join us midstream, also an economist in his own right, to get his expert take on this.
[00:52:57.054 --> 00:53:11.218]  I'm holding Max over so we can at least talk to John and Charles, Jacob, Josh, and maybe Mike, but I just want to say I've done two hours of radio now and haven't really plugged my films, and that's how we finance ourselves here.
[00:53:11.438 --> 00:53:12.718]  We can't just make money out of nothing.
[00:53:12.758 --> 00:53:16.419]  We've got to crawl around with little crumbs and try to fund our operation to beat these people.
[00:53:17.459 --> 00:53:38.383]  But if you'll go to Infowars.com, the online video bookstore, and buy some of the t-shirts, videos, books, materials, they're the best films, best books, you know, not just my work, but the stuff I see that I think is really informative, we carry it at Infowars.com, whether it's Follow the Republic, Obama Deception, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, such key intelligence, Invisible Empire, In Order to Find, Endgame, Shadow Government.
[00:53:38.703 --> 00:53:41.944]  You can also now pre-order it, start shipping out at the end of next week.
[00:53:43.377 --> 00:53:54.648]  You can also now pre-order the new film, Don't Tread on Me, which gets into states' rights and how to take the states back, and Democracy vs. Republic.
[00:53:54.708 --> 00:53:58.672]  It's such an important film by the makers of Camp FEMA, Gary Franchi and William Lewis.
[00:53:58.912 --> 00:54:01.735]  Okay, let's go right back to calls for Max Keiser.
[00:54:02.316 --> 00:54:03.597]  Let's talk to John in Ohio.
[00:54:03.657 --> 00:54:04.398]  John, you're on the air.
[00:54:05.583 --> 00:54:16.169]  Yeah, I wanted to call you just before the end of the program when you got cut off last week and then you said call the next day and then there were no calls, so I'm going to try to relate this to what you're talking about now.
[00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:23.974]  I need probably a hundred times more articulateness and a thousand hours to describe all the ways
[00:54:24.738 --> 00:54:26.599]  I disagree with part of your analysis.
[00:54:26.639 --> 00:54:34.866]  I think you're progressive in certain ways and absolutely fascist in other points that I think cancel out much of the good that you're doing.
[00:54:34.886 --> 00:54:37.728]  John, Max Keiser's on.
[00:54:37.748 --> 00:54:39.169]  Do you have a question or comment for him?
[00:54:39.189 --> 00:54:40.890]  I really don't care what you think of me, John.
[00:54:40.911 --> 00:54:41.891]  I appreciate your call, though.
[00:54:41.931 --> 00:54:42.852]  Go ahead.
[00:54:43.593 --> 00:54:44.593]  I'll ask you a question.
[00:54:45.114 --> 00:54:53.040]  Now, you said that the IMF and the World Bank are really the villains that are really plundering and raping the world.
[00:54:53.783 --> 00:55:07.354]  And yet, you say that countries like Chavez and Cuba, who are trying their best, imperfectly, to resist this kind of plunder, are subjected to the worst kind of slander by the media.
[00:55:07.374 --> 00:55:14.379]  And you say you don't agree with the corporate media, the CIA-connected media, yet you repeat exactly those kinds of disinformation.
[00:55:14.419 --> 00:55:15.440]  John, I appreciate your call.
[00:55:18.268 --> 00:55:21.571]  Iran is run by thugs at many levels.
[00:55:22.131 --> 00:55:23.052]  So is our government.
[00:55:23.853 --> 00:55:27.136]  It isn't either Chavez is good or Obama's good.
[00:55:27.416 --> 00:55:28.196]  They're both bad.
[00:55:28.216 --> 00:55:33.341]  I mean, it's such a child... I'm not saying you're like a child, but that is... Max Keiser, it's so childlike.
[00:55:33.361 --> 00:55:34.462]  I mean, do you have any comments?
[00:55:35.302 --> 00:55:41.548]  All I can say is that, you know, I wish times were better because I could give up my gig as Max the Orange Home Gang Gorilla.
[00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:45.291]  Oh my God.
[00:55:48.749 --> 00:55:50.890]  Kaiser, you've always got some ridiculous joke.
[00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:57.353]  You know, it just occurred to me, every time we break to a commercial, you talk about Max the Orange Gorilla.
[00:55:57.513 --> 00:56:00.955]  And I'm thinking to myself, Jesus, you know, that guy's probably making better money than I am.
[00:56:02.831 --> 00:56:09.813]  Alright Max, we're going to come back to the final segment and go to Charles, Jacob and Josh and Mike with serious questions for Max Keiser.
[00:56:10.074 --> 00:56:11.594]  But we do have to have some gallows humor.
[00:56:11.774 --> 00:56:20.657]  But seriously, what is this mindset where people think, I've got to be, you know, how can I be against white supremacists and against black supremacists?
[00:56:21.177 --> 00:56:23.318]  Well, I'm against all these racists.
[00:56:23.758 --> 00:56:27.519]  Or, how can I be against communism, but then I'm against the big banks?
[00:56:27.639 --> 00:56:31.801]  I'm against any form of tyranny, and tyranny has a lot of different flavors, doesn't it Max?
[00:56:33.027 --> 00:56:41.529]  Well, that's a problem you have, because you are very far-ranging in your look and criticism of things.
[00:56:41.949 --> 00:56:48.010]  I focus purely on the banks, markets, and finance, and through that prism, I see things clearly.
[00:56:48.030 --> 00:56:49.610]  If you know what I mean.
[00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:53.171]  I'm not trying to evade the answer, I'm just saying that... No, no, I agree with you.
[00:56:53.231 --> 00:56:56.331]  I mean, the big threat is not Hugo Chavez, it's Goldman Sachs.
[00:56:56.691 --> 00:56:59.192]  But it doesn't mean I have to bow down to Hugo Chavez.
[00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:07.787]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoodsDirect was putting together a high-volume, pre-production order of the new Quick Fix meals.
[00:57:08.068 --> 00:57:15.134]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive one free item for every three that they bought.
[00:57:15.415 --> 00:57:22.201]  Since the final shutdown of this buy three, get one free program, we've had a lot of folks calling, disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[00:57:22.401 --> 00:57:23.242]  Listen carefully.
[00:57:23.602 --> 00:57:33.105]  Starting immediately, efoodsdirect.com will take pre-production orders for a buy three get one free program for one week ending May 14th at midnight.
[00:57:33.325 --> 00:57:37.346]  You will receive one free item for every three that you order of the selected products.
[00:57:37.546 --> 00:57:40.407]  These orders will begin shipping the first week of June.
[00:57:40.547 --> 00:57:44.728]  To order on the web, efoodsdirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633.
[00:57:44.748 --> 00:57:46.089]  That's efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:57:51.911 --> 00:57:52.892]  800-409-5633.
[00:57:53.273 --> 00:57:56.315]  Again, that's efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:57:56.335 --> 00:57:56.916]  800-409-5633.
[00:57:56.956 --> 00:58:01.059]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:01.119 --> 00:58:06.464]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:58:06.684 --> 00:58:11.328]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:58:11.728 --> 00:58:16.753]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:58:17.273 --> 00:58:21.976]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:58:22.497 --> 00:58:24.418]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:58:24.818 --> 00:58:29.421]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:58:29.621 --> 00:58:30.522]  And here's the best part.
[00:58:30.742 --> 00:58:33.504]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:58:33.804 --> 00:58:37.126]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:58:37.426 --> 00:58:40.268]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:58:40.609 --> 00:58:42.510]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:58:42.850 --> 00:58:43.771]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:58:47.393 --> 00:58:48.414]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:58:48.834 --> 00:58:56.140]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:58:56.460 --> 00:58:58.922]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:58:59.563 --> 00:59:01.865]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:59:01.885 --> 00:59:04.167]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:59:04.287 --> 00:59:07.049]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:59:07.489 --> 00:59:12.253]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:59:12.593 --> 00:59:16.777]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:59:17.077 --> 00:59:19.440]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:21.964]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:59:22.324 --> 00:59:24.887]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:59:25.248 --> 00:59:32.858]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:59:33.177 --> 00:59:38.400]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:40.842]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:59:40.882 --> 00:59:44.844]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:59:45.104 --> 00:59:46.025]  And I got news for you.
[00:59:46.165 --> 00:59:47.486]  You're everyone else.
[00:59:47.506 --> 00:59:48.506]  Invisible Empire.

[01:00:02.856 --> 01:00:08.858]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:09.479 --> 01:00:12.520]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.921]  We are going into financial bondage.
[01:00:14.961 --> 01:00:16.802]  We are under financial siege.
[01:00:17.542 --> 01:00:22.104]  A trillion dollars pumped into private banks, Europe being told they've got to give up their pension funds.
[01:00:23.124 --> 01:00:25.725]  The Germans on the verge of throwing out Merkel.
[01:00:25.766 --> 01:00:28.587]  She lost many seats in their government.
[01:00:28.807 --> 01:00:29.287]  Same thing.
[01:00:29.327 --> 01:00:30.528]  Gordon Brown steps down.
[01:00:30.888 --> 01:00:33.630]  Nicolas Sarkozy in trouble, saying no to the carbon tax.
[01:00:34.210 --> 01:00:43.655]  So we're having some victories against the bankers setting up their global tax, but they're going to hold us in financial hostages until we go along with it and continue to play games.
[01:00:43.695 --> 01:00:48.677]  As the real economy dies, they continue to have everyone addicted to their stock market.
[01:00:48.717 --> 01:00:51.679]  Is that a good assessment, Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com?
[01:00:52.159 --> 01:01:07.513]  Well, all the professionals who work in the gaming industry, and we talked about this last time, and the online gaming industry migrating into the finance business so that all of the techniques that get people hooked on games
[01:01:08.466 --> 01:01:11.528]  ...are being used to get people hooked on doing day trading.
[01:01:11.608 --> 01:01:29.397]  So, as I explained earlier in the show, when you see a Goldman Sachs or somebody like that pushing prices up 2 or 3 percent, the folks that are on the day trading, you know, addiction, kick in, and they are doing the dirty work for them.
[01:01:29.597 --> 01:01:34.900]  So they've basically created an army of what I call Manchurian candidates.
[01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:37.101]  These people, they just, when they hear the trigger word,
[01:01:37.642 --> 01:01:37.943]  I think so.
[01:01:45.242 --> 01:01:53.826]  And it's like that with terrorism, it's like that with the Infoni environmental movement, it's all these mind-controlled zombie groups that give the globalists power.
[01:01:53.866 --> 01:01:55.507]  But look at the controllers.
[01:01:55.527 --> 01:01:59.829]  They can't even plug this oil leak that's now millions and millions of gallons.
[01:01:59.869 --> 01:02:02.010]  They lied about that and said it was a few thousand gallons.
[01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:03.111]  They're not God.
[01:02:03.131 --> 01:02:07.853]  And that's what's even more dangerous is, is that I think they're going to lose control.
[01:02:08.013 --> 01:02:09.574]  I believe they're starting to lose control.
[01:02:09.894 --> 01:02:12.175]  Webster Tarpley, who I really respect, believes that as well.
[01:02:12.615 --> 01:02:13.996]  I mean, do you see them losing control?
[01:02:15.194 --> 01:02:20.537]  The payout from the insurance company is way more than the money they're losing on that oil spill, Alex.
[01:02:20.977 --> 01:02:23.078]  The insurance is overwritten.
[01:02:23.259 --> 01:02:26.961]  Just like these companies in America buy life insurance on employees.
[01:02:27.321 --> 01:02:32.043]  So when employees die, the life insurance company gets the money, not the family.
[01:02:32.083 --> 01:02:35.805]  No, that's what Walmart greeters are for, is they do actuaries that come out.
[01:02:36.226 --> 01:02:42.209]  They know when they're going to die statistically, so they just hire a bunch of old people to stand there because they're putting three mil on each one of them.
[01:02:42.697 --> 01:02:44.279]  They get the money, not the families.
[01:02:44.699 --> 01:02:44.980]  Okay?
[01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:48.403]  This oil spill is not going to lose money for anybody who's responsible.
[01:02:48.423 --> 01:02:49.565]  They're going to make money.
[01:02:49.785 --> 01:02:59.556]  It's built up the entire economic system in a way that the risk is only borne by the majority of people who have no money and all of the rewards float up to those
[01:03:01.550 --> 01:03:04.631]  Risk is socialized, profit privatized.
[01:03:04.911 --> 01:03:12.514]  We're going to take a few quick questions because we've got George Humphrey here in studio and Max Keiser has to go here in just a moment.
[01:03:12.554 --> 01:03:15.736]  But Charles in Louisiana, you're on the air with Max Keiser.
[01:03:15.756 --> 01:03:16.076]  Go ahead.
[01:03:16.096 --> 01:03:17.236]  How are you doing, sir?
[01:03:17.836 --> 01:03:21.358]  Yeah, I'm down here in Louisiana watching all this.
[01:03:21.398 --> 01:03:24.519]  They said in 72 hours they're going to try something else.
[01:03:25.239 --> 01:03:26.560]  But they really haven't.
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:28.160]  It's another Katrina.
[01:03:28.581 --> 01:03:29.701]  And they laid back on it.
[01:03:30.185 --> 01:03:36.268]  What they want to do now is take human hair and animal hair to suck it up off the beaches to make maps out of it.
[01:03:36.968 --> 01:03:42.210]  But I think what's going to... the Bayou Boys, it's going to tear them up.
[01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:43.891]  It's going to finish the Bayou Boys.
[01:03:43.991 --> 01:03:45.491]  All the boats docked right now.
[01:03:46.372 --> 01:03:47.792]  You can't buy no seafood.
[01:03:50.233 --> 01:03:51.514]  It's right now in Venice.
[01:03:51.594 --> 01:03:53.455]  It's 10 miles off the shore, real heavy.
[01:03:53.835 --> 01:03:55.796]  And they hit the shore in Alabama now.
[01:03:57.009 --> 01:04:01.610]  When it hits here, it's just going to wipe Louisiana out.
[01:04:02.170 --> 01:04:03.510]  And I think all of a sudden, states.
[01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:05.951]  Well, they continue to underestimate the amount.
[01:04:06.231 --> 01:04:12.812]  First, it was a few thousand gallons a day, but experts looked at the satellite photos and said it had to be hundreds of thousands a day.
[01:04:13.092 --> 01:04:15.193]  It's now 3.5 million gallons.
[01:04:15.753 --> 01:04:17.773]  Who knows, it could be 20 million gallons.
[01:04:18.073 --> 01:04:19.834]  I mean, they're such liars, Max Keiser.
[01:04:19.874 --> 01:04:20.354]  Who knows?
[01:04:20.894 --> 01:04:21.994]  Well, it sounds medieval.
[01:04:22.014 --> 01:04:23.875]  They're making mats out of people's hair?
[01:04:24.035 --> 01:04:24.615]  What's next, leeches?
[01:04:26.431 --> 01:04:27.652]  Yeah, I don't know what this is.
[01:04:27.712 --> 01:04:33.436]  I heard it on news radio driving in this morning, and the host was saying, what are mats of hair gonna do?
[01:04:33.457 --> 01:04:36.159]  In fact, guys, pull up oil spill mats of hair.
[01:04:36.419 --> 01:04:38.761]  What are they talking about, mats of hair?
[01:04:41.323 --> 01:04:50.370]  Because if you go back a few hundred years, people back in the medieval times, when they had problems like this, they would band together and cut their hair off and make mats of hair.
[01:04:50.410 --> 01:04:52.872]  But, I mean, is this the best America has to offer?
[01:04:52.932 --> 01:04:53.772]  Medieval cures?
[01:04:58.257 --> 01:04:59.999]  But listen, people, you think we're joking.
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.742]  What have you heard about the mats of hair?
[01:05:03.762 --> 01:05:10.269]  I thought I was in the Twilight Zone driving in, but it was a mainstream talk radio going, what is this about mats of hair in the Gulf?
[01:05:10.409 --> 01:05:13.593]  So they're going to have people cut their hair off and throw it in the ocean?
[01:05:14.133 --> 01:05:15.054]  I think so.
[01:05:31.363 --> 01:05:34.227]  The probability of there being a spill was virtually nothing.
[01:05:34.487 --> 01:05:41.095]  It explodes because nobody bothered to spend the half a million dollars on the safety equipment that would have prevented this thing from blowing up.
[01:05:41.356 --> 01:05:46.362]  And to cure the problem, they're going to have people collect hair at salons and make hair mats from stockings.
[01:05:46.662 --> 01:06:05.791]  All right, real fast, because I want to go to calls, but specifically, we've had some guests on who talk about the fact that this happened right after the Day After Earth Day, that Obama didn't really want to allow drilling, that BP is going to make money off insurance on this, that they're only liable for something like $750 million.
[01:06:07.011 --> 01:06:08.832]  Are you hinting at this being staged, Max?
[01:06:09.522 --> 01:06:09.722]  No.
[01:06:10.263 --> 01:06:10.963]  No, I'm not hinting.
[01:06:11.283 --> 01:06:16.947]  I'm hinting that the companies are too cheap to buy adequate safety equipment.
[01:06:18.068 --> 01:06:34.339]  Think about, for example, I don't want to go open a big thing here, but for $50 an airplane, it would have been very easy to have an adequate lock between the cockpit and the fuselage of an airplane.
[01:06:34.619 --> 01:06:35.840]  But airlines are too cheap.
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:37.140]  Industry is too cheap.
[01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.382]  They could have prevented terrorist attacks.
[01:06:40.223 --> 01:06:43.767]  But Max, you know as well as I, 9-11 was a staged event.
[01:06:44.228 --> 01:06:47.712]  Well, you know, but I'm just saying that they're ultimately, they're cheap.
[01:06:47.772 --> 01:06:52.999]  So this is a half a million dollar piece of equipment that BP, other countries by the way, not in America.
[01:06:53.379 --> 01:06:54.741]  Now I know, everybody else has them.
[01:06:56.613 --> 01:06:57.774]  All right, Max, absolutely.
[01:06:57.814 --> 01:07:02.078]  Let's get to a few final questions for you because you've got to go.
[01:07:02.098 --> 01:07:03.879]  Jacob in Oregon, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:07:22.995 --> 01:07:26.157]  You're on the air with Max, the home game orange gorilla.
[01:07:26.197 --> 01:07:26.617]  Go ahead.
[01:07:27.858 --> 01:07:28.478]  Fantastic.
[01:07:28.518 --> 01:07:29.059]  Thanks, Max.
[01:07:29.139 --> 01:07:30.439]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:37.504]  Max, thanks, first of all, for answering most of my questions, actually, during the course of this show.
[01:07:37.844 --> 01:07:52.573]  But I do have one final one, and that is that, you know, reading over the patent, I've only read the one from 1999 that looks at the virtual specialist, kind of sets it up as a sort of distributed system of trading, kind of turns, kind of develops a trading machine gun.
[01:07:53.382 --> 01:08:03.287]  Now it sounds, it seems like it's being used as a nuclear weapon to, except instead of a bomb just destroying your house, it takes everything from your neighbor's garage and puts it in yours.
[01:08:04.087 --> 01:08:11.071]  How, is this really the first strike, would you say, in what we would consider cyber warfare?
[01:08:12.671 --> 01:08:19.557]  Well, as I said at the top of the show, I think it's an example of a domestic financial terrorist attack, unequivocal, so it's the first example.
[01:08:19.877 --> 01:08:22.139]  As far as my patent goes, yeah, you're absolutely right.
[01:08:22.439 --> 01:08:24.180]  It's not used the way it was designed.
[01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:30.746]  It was designed, actually, to eliminate front-running and to eliminate the broker-dealer conflict.
[01:08:31.066 --> 01:08:41.654]  But instead, the new owner, Cancer Fitzgerald, they've accentuated the broker-dealer conflict and they've made it, they've turned it inside out, which under European laws is completely illegal, by the way.
[01:08:43.758 --> 01:08:45.699]  Because it's all globalized, they do whatever they want.
[01:08:45.879 --> 01:08:46.860]  But let me throw this out there.
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:53.824]  Did you see the Hill newspaper and also CBS with Obama over the weekend saying this may have been cyber terror?
[01:08:54.084 --> 01:09:00.027]  Well obviously it's Goldman Sachs doing it and they stand to gain and it was staged, it wasn't a fat finger.
[01:09:00.428 --> 01:09:05.951]  So now they're going to use this to take our internet freedoms, claiming that some guy in a cave did this.
[01:09:07.031 --> 01:09:15.535]  Well, I think you have to differentiate between cyber terror, as that term is understood, and this is financial, what I call financial terror.
[01:09:15.935 --> 01:09:20.717]  Cyber terror would be something like a distributed denial of service attack, you see between China and the U.S.
[01:09:20.777 --> 01:09:22.438]  all the time, it takes place over the internet.
[01:09:22.478 --> 01:09:24.799]  Or somebody hacking into a hospital and turning the power off.
[01:09:25.977 --> 01:09:26.658]  No, I know.
[01:09:26.678 --> 01:09:31.745]  My question is, Max, what do you think of Obama floating the idea that men with turbines did this?
[01:09:40.151 --> 01:09:50.225]  Well, I didn't hear him say that, but I can tell you that it was Goldman Sachs.
[01:09:50.305 --> 01:09:52.528]  I mean, I don't know, what else can I tell you?
[01:09:52.548 --> 01:09:54.070]  No, I know.
[01:09:54.231 --> 01:09:54.791]  I agree with you.
[01:09:54.851 --> 01:09:55.673]  Hey guys, pull it up.
[01:09:58.015 --> 01:10:04.401]  Pull it up, Obama says stock market plunge, maybe cyber attack, or maybe sabotage was the headline.
[01:10:05.162 --> 01:10:07.764]  If he said it, he's completely misinformed.
[01:10:08.284 --> 01:10:09.345]  Well, he's misinformed.
[01:10:09.405 --> 01:10:13.069]  I mean, he's not an expert in these areas, and he made a misstatement.
[01:10:13.129 --> 01:10:14.490]  He doesn't really understand.
[01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:16.912]  Well, I don't think it's a misstatement.
[01:10:16.952 --> 01:10:21.557]  I mean, when somebody slips on a banana peel, they say Al Qaeda did it, and we just give up all our rights and keep us safe.
[01:10:22.952 --> 01:10:25.374]  Well, I'm telling you what happened.
[01:10:26.455 --> 01:10:30.499]  From the point of view of somebody who is very familiar with these systems.
[01:10:31.698 --> 01:10:34.339]  Well, we know they're lying and saying a fat finger did it.
[01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:37.641]  I mean, they're saying a fat finger did it, and now they admit it wasn't a fat finger.
[01:10:37.881 --> 01:10:39.302]  No, it was not a fat finger.
[01:10:39.842 --> 01:10:41.103]  That was not the problem.
[01:10:41.123 --> 01:10:42.284]  They've already been discredited.
[01:10:42.424 --> 01:10:45.546]  That idea is no longer even being considered.
[01:10:46.006 --> 01:10:53.270]  And now, if you have people like Janet Tavakoli, who is extremely well-respected, now questioning whether or not this was market manipulation,
[01:10:53.610 --> 01:10:53.870]  I think so.
[01:11:10.799 --> 01:11:11.980]  That's right.
[01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:16.501]  And I'm going to have Paul Watson go over to MaxKaiser.com and get your top story about this.
[01:11:16.521 --> 01:11:17.942]  We're going to do our own big report on it.
[01:11:18.542 --> 01:11:19.643]  MaxKaiser.com.
[01:11:19.683 --> 01:11:22.224]  Kaiser spelled K-E-I-S-E-R.
[01:11:22.964 --> 01:11:24.525]  Max, it's always great having you on.
[01:11:24.545 --> 01:11:25.585]  I appreciate your time.
[01:11:25.625 --> 01:11:29.547]  It's always thought-provoking and you have been dead on right about everything so far.
[01:11:30.367 --> 01:11:37.192]  I just wish that you were wrong about this gulag economy, but you normally join us once a month, so that means you're coming up in just a week or two.
[01:11:38.132 --> 01:11:44.517]  And so I look forward to having you back on with us to be able to cover the aftermath of the latest looting that's happened.
[01:11:44.957 --> 01:11:47.579]  Yeah, and remember the home-grown gorilla.
[01:11:51.902 --> 01:11:53.803]  Man, I tell you what, you are something else.
[01:11:53.863 --> 01:11:55.865]  Max Keiser, we'll talk to you again soon.
[01:11:55.885 --> 01:11:56.405]  God bless you.
[01:11:56.965 --> 01:11:57.726]  All right, see ya.
[01:12:00.768 --> 01:12:09.853]  Global meltdowns, massive unemployment, endless wars, a new currency crisis, financially and morally bankrupt, a great and terrible storm is approaching.
[01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:13.335]  So what's the best way to get ready to get prepared for hard times ahead?
[01:12:13.555 --> 01:12:23.001]  In producing Off The Grid News, a weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[01:12:23.161 --> 01:12:28.404]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness, survival skills, and off-the-grid living.
[01:12:28.684 --> 01:12:43.949]  Off the Grid News is fiercely independent, all about self-reliance and packed with helpful information on survival gardening, food preparation, alternative energy, herbal medicines, privacy and security, as well as God, gold and guns, with absolutely no apologies.
[01:12:44.129 --> 01:12:48.631]  And the best part, this $100 a year service is now free of charge for our listeners.
[01:12:48.751 --> 01:12:52.372]  That's right, free for our listeners who sign up at OffTheGridNews.com.
[01:12:53.012 --> 01:12:54.918]  That's OffTheGridNews.com.
[01:12:55.119 --> 01:12:58.328]  You can sign up free at OffTheGridNews.com.

[01:13:00.894 --> 01:13:03.615]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[01:13:03.855 --> 01:13:07.796]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[01:13:07.996 --> 01:13:10.077]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:13:10.277 --> 01:13:15.298]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[01:13:15.439 --> 01:13:17.199]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[01:13:17.259 --> 01:13:18.599]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:20.240]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:23.341]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[01:13:23.661 --> 01:13:28.687]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:13:29.027 --> 01:13:38.158]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[01:13:38.378 --> 01:13:40.681]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:13:43.524 --> 01:13:44.184]  We're good to go.
[01:14:00.612 --> 01:14:02.933]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:14:03.013 --> 01:14:05.194]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:14:05.314 --> 01:14:08.115]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:14:08.535 --> 01:14:13.276]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:14:13.637 --> 01:14:17.818]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:14:18.138 --> 01:14:20.460]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:23.021]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:14:23.381 --> 01:14:25.943]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:14:26.283 --> 01:14:33.888]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:14:34.228 --> 01:14:39.471]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:14:39.611 --> 01:14:41.893]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:14:42.473 --> 01:14:45.895]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:14:46.155 --> 01:14:47.076]  And I got news for you.
[01:14:47.236 --> 01:14:48.537]  You're everyone else.
[01:14:48.577 --> 01:14:49.577]  Invisible Empire.

[01:15:00.724 --> 01:15:01.925]  Let's talk tough.
[01:15:02.492 --> 01:15:03.653]  Let's talk comfort.
[01:15:03.893 --> 01:15:05.995]  Let's talk about down-home value.
[01:15:06.275 --> 01:15:08.817]  Made in the USA, blue jeans.
[01:15:09.217 --> 01:15:10.898]  Like you wore as a kid.
[01:15:11.219 --> 01:15:11.679]  Remember?
[01:15:12.099 --> 01:15:18.884]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond-gusset jeans.
[01:15:20.746 --> 01:15:23.408]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:15:24.789 --> 01:15:26.730]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:15:29.171 --> 01:15:39.779]  We're good old-fashioned comfort.
[01:15:39.919 --> 01:15:41.380]  Get Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:42.961]  Every stitch guaranteed.
[01:15:43.181 --> 01:15:46.184]  In our Defender motorcycle jean comes Kevlar reinforced.
[01:15:46.424 --> 01:15:47.244]  See them at gusset.com.
[01:15:47.264 --> 01:15:48.285]  That's gusset.com.
[01:15:48.405 --> 01:15:48.926]  Or call 888-848-7738.
[01:15:48.986 --> 01:15:49.206]  That's 888-848-7738.
[01:15:49.226 --> 01:15:50.107]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[01:15:50.167 --> 01:15:50.527]  Others don't.
[01:16:03.618 --> 01:16:04.139]  Don't worry.
[01:16:04.579 --> 01:16:06.101]  This show is documented.
[01:16:06.642 --> 01:16:09.906]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:16:10.147 --> 01:16:13.271]  Okay, he's gonna be with us 20 minutes into the next hour.
[01:16:14.352 --> 01:16:16.715]  And I'm just gonna cover the whole Larry Conquista...
[01:16:18.419 --> 01:16:27.325]  Machete movie and all these speeches around the country with the illegal alien groups saying whites are the devil, we gotta get them, we gotta bring in communism.
[01:16:27.705 --> 01:16:29.707]  How it's all funded by the government on record.
[01:16:29.727 --> 01:16:31.148]  I'm just going to cover that for an hour tomorrow.
[01:16:31.728 --> 01:16:34.290]  Because this economic information is too important.
[01:16:34.650 --> 01:16:39.193]  Here it is, White House doesn't rule out sabotage in Thursday's wild Wall Street plunge.
[01:16:39.213 --> 01:16:40.034]  That's out of the hill.
[01:16:40.894 --> 01:16:43.977]  And they've got that from the West Wing office.
[01:16:44.077 --> 01:16:45.217]  Gibbs told reporters this.
[01:16:48.328 --> 01:16:50.189]  Meanwhile, it's Goldman Sachs, clearly.
[01:16:50.229 --> 01:16:51.030]  I agree with Kaiser.
[01:16:51.070 --> 01:16:51.971]  All the evidence is there.
[01:16:52.311 --> 01:17:05.241]  George Humphrey is a author, filmmaker, former Austin City Council member, a degreed economist, good friend of mine, and he's with us now for probably more than an hour, and it's great to have him in studio.
[01:17:05.301 --> 01:17:06.221]  So much is happening.
[01:17:06.241 --> 01:17:10.244]  Everything is accelerating and quickening, George, and he's here with us in studio.
[01:17:11.365 --> 01:17:14.387]  You've got the floor about what's happening in the markets and where all this is headed.
[01:17:14.707 --> 01:17:16.309]  Well, first of all, I want to say
[01:17:16.909 --> 01:17:21.633]  If you like excitement and if you like fun, this is the place to be right now.
[01:17:22.154 --> 01:17:31.882]  There is nothing more exciting that is happening in the world, and there is no place in the world that you can get better information than on this radio show.
[01:17:32.102 --> 01:17:36.186]  And I am truly honored to be here and to be your friend.
[01:17:36.366 --> 01:17:40.169]  And this Max Geiser who was just on, man, that guy rocks!
[01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:41.511]  He is incredible!
[01:17:42.131 --> 01:17:48.415]  And, you know, you have people like Bob Chapman on the show, who is one of the finest economists in the whole country.
[01:17:48.615 --> 01:18:01.022]  And so, for the listeners who are brand new, you know, I know, I've known Alex since he was 17, and he rants and he raves and he yells and all sorts of stuff, but he's telling you the truth, you know?
[01:18:01.162 --> 01:18:04.804]  And so, keep listening and keep buying the product.
[01:18:04.824 --> 01:18:08.506]  That's right, I knew you in high school because you were involved with Pat, Pat Buchanan and stuff.
[01:18:08.706 --> 01:18:09.207]  Yeah.
[01:18:09.247 --> 01:18:10.348]  And it's the first run.
[01:18:10.608 --> 01:18:12.370]  And I remember coming by your house to get signs.
[01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:12.890]  Yeah.
[01:18:13.050 --> 01:18:15.593]  And we've been doing this for a long, long, long time.
[01:18:15.653 --> 01:18:20.778]  And back in the early 90s, people used to make fun of us and yell at us.
[01:18:20.858 --> 01:18:28.745]  And when 9-11 happened, you know, and that week we came out and said it was not what the government was saying.
[01:18:29.506 --> 01:18:32.649]  And for the couple of years, we took a lot of heat from that.
[01:18:33.770 --> 01:18:39.315]  And not everything that I say or you say is absolutely dead right on, but I'll tell you what.
[01:18:39.996 --> 01:18:46.301]  I would match your record against any record in any prognication of anybody in this country.
[01:18:46.361 --> 01:18:52.146]  And the point is, is that we are facing an economic and political tsunami.
[01:18:52.907 --> 01:18:55.168]  There's no question whatsoever.
[01:18:55.688 --> 01:19:01.771]  Now, 15 years ago, if we were on the beach and the water started pulling out, we wouldn't know what was happening.
[01:19:01.811 --> 01:19:05.752]  We'd probably just sit there and get hit by the tsunami.
[01:19:06.092 --> 01:19:13.835]  Now, because of shows like this and because of the work of myself and thousands of other patriots, people are waking up to what's going on.
[01:19:14.556 --> 01:19:17.497]  The economic tide has pulled out.
[01:19:18.342 --> 01:19:20.483]  And it's going up further and further.
[01:19:21.083 --> 01:19:34.269]  There is no question whatsoever that we are going to experience the largest economic tsunami in the history of this Western culture in this period of life.
[01:19:34.749 --> 01:19:35.490]  And it is coming.
[01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:40.852]  Now, whether it's going to come in a couple of months or in five months or a year and a half, we don't know.
[01:19:40.932 --> 01:19:42.353]  But it's already happening.
[01:19:42.373 --> 01:19:46.735]  We're seeing the breakup of the European Union right at this period of time.
[01:19:47.375 --> 01:19:53.977]  The American government, the American economy, the American dollar are dying as we speak.
[01:19:54.057 --> 01:19:55.998]  It's a dead man walking.
[01:19:56.118 --> 01:20:04.141]  No matter what we do, no matter how much money is printed, no matter how much credit is put out there, no matter how many lies they tell,
[01:20:05.168 --> 01:20:07.329]  We cannot fix the Illuminati.
[01:20:07.349 --> 01:20:08.469]  And the globalists know that.
[01:20:08.549 --> 01:20:09.590]  That's the trap.
[01:20:09.610 --> 01:20:11.090]  That's the loan sharking.
[01:20:11.271 --> 01:20:13.291]  And they're just amassing power right now.
[01:20:13.471 --> 01:20:22.335]  Yes, and one of the things is when you study history, you realize is that the Illuminati's motto is, out of chaos, power.
[01:20:22.635 --> 01:20:24.276]  Out of chaos is order.
[01:20:24.876 --> 01:20:33.020]  And all of this is pre-arranged disintegration of the very vehicle that keeps America
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:42.867]  The American Republic, the strongest government, the strongest concept of hope and of freedom in the whole world.
[01:20:43.547 --> 01:20:49.131]  Our nation, our republic, our society is being systematically destroyed.
[01:20:49.632 --> 01:21:02.081]  And I know that for some people this is very difficult to understand, but when one looks at the facts, the facts are that the economic tsunami that is coming at us is going to make what happened
[01:21:02.521 --> 01:21:19.326]  in indonesian thailand and india seem like small fry and all you have to do is take a look at the fact that total federal state local personal debt is nine hundred percent greater than the gross national product that's not including the derivatives
[01:21:20.046 --> 01:21:23.751]  And then if you add the derivatives, there's another hundred... Stay there, start over.
[01:21:23.812 --> 01:21:24.953]  Long segment coming up.
[01:21:25.033 --> 01:21:30.822]  And they're on record saying they're setting up a bank of the world that will have a new global currency that's digital.
[01:21:31.022 --> 01:21:33.525]  You'll still have your local currency, but it'll be set by this group.
[01:21:34.186 --> 01:21:35.468]  And then they state...
[01:21:36.601 --> 01:21:39.563]  The reasons they want the world government, and it only gets worse from there.
[01:21:40.624 --> 01:21:42.705]  And so George Humphrey is our guest economist.
[01:21:43.045 --> 01:21:44.126]  Your phone calls are coming up.
[01:21:44.166 --> 01:21:46.568]  He'll be with us into the next hour as well.
[01:21:46.588 --> 01:21:47.048]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:21:47.068 --> 01:21:50.910]  We appreciate it, George Boehner.
[01:21:50.930 --> 01:21:51.791]  We're on the march.
[01:21:52.271 --> 01:21:53.872]  The empire's on the run.
[01:21:54.813 --> 01:21:57.495]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:01.761]  Dog chewed your remote control?
[01:22:02.021 --> 01:22:02.782]  Lost your remote?
[01:22:03.062 --> 01:22:05.243]  Or is your remote control just not working?
[01:22:05.624 --> 01:22:08.826]  Let ReplacementRemotes.com replace or fix it for you.
[01:22:09.126 --> 01:22:17.171]  We carry a complete line of remote controls for all brands of TV, home audio or DVD remotes, including old or hard-to-find remote controls.
[01:22:17.571 --> 01:22:19.913]  We also can repair or fix your remote control.
[01:22:20.313 --> 01:22:22.995]  Visit ReplacementRemotes.com for all your

[01:22:59.623 --> 01:23:07.368]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoodsDirect was putting together a high-volume, pre-production order of the new Quick-Fix meals.
[01:23:07.628 --> 01:23:14.653]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive one free item for every three that they bought.
[01:23:14.973 --> 01:23:21.759]  Since the final shutdown of this buy three get one free program, we've had a lot of folks calling disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[01:23:21.959 --> 01:23:22.820]  Listen carefully.
[01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:32.688]  Starting immediately, efoodsdirect.com will take pre-production orders for a buy three get one free program for one week ending May 14th at midnight.
[01:23:32.908 --> 01:23:36.931]  You will receive one free item for every three that you order of the selected products.
[01:23:37.132 --> 01:23:39.954]  These orders will begin shipping the first week of June.
[01:23:40.114 --> 01:23:44.356]  To order on the web, efoodsdirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633.
[01:23:44.416 --> 01:23:46.477]  That's efoodsdirect.com slash Alex, 800-409-5633.
[01:23:46.517 --> 01:23:49.639]  Again, that's efoodsdirect.com slash Alex, 800-409-5633.
[01:24:00.595 --> 01:24:08.701]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[01:24:09.081 --> 01:24:19.529]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[01:24:19.970 --> 01:24:25.394]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[01:24:25.954 --> 01:24:30.437]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[01:24:30.837 --> 01:24:39.563]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[01:24:39.903 --> 01:24:49.730]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:53.192]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:24:53.713 --> 01:24:54.713]  Silverlungs.com.
[01:24:55.875 --> 01:24:56.015]  Yeah.
[01:25:05.862 --> 01:25:08.904]  We're going back to George Humphrey here in just a moment, and then your phone calls.
[01:25:10.045 --> 01:25:14.328]  Again, economist, successful businessman, former city council member, author, filmmaker.
[01:25:14.728 --> 01:25:22.454]  Before we go back to George to go over the economic facts we're facing, because we're in much greater debt than Greece was, much greater debt than even England.
[01:25:22.734 --> 01:25:27.918]  This has all been designed through fraud, and then now you're seeing the government announce
[01:25:29.048 --> 01:25:33.312]  Almost all the taxes will go to interest on debt, not to services.
[01:25:33.832 --> 01:25:38.597]  And Bloomberg and others announcing what's already happened in Greece, we want all or part of your pension funds.
[01:25:39.477 --> 01:25:41.639]  That isn't just the government coming and taking your pension funds.
[01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:49.386]  That is private corporations just shutting down and leaving, or creating a subsidiary, then destroying the old company and taking your pension fund.
[01:25:49.426 --> 01:25:50.988]  I mean, so many scams.
[01:25:51.008 --> 01:25:51.789]  They've now set up a
[01:25:53.117 --> 01:25:56.238]  FEMA, over 40% plus of the U.S.
[01:25:56.878 --> 01:26:01.320]  national property tax on 40% of the property in the country.
[01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:02.340]  They call flood insurance.
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:03.961]  I mean, it's all happening now.
[01:26:03.981 --> 01:26:04.961]  We're going to talk about it in a moment.
[01:26:04.981 --> 01:26:09.143]  Before we do that, a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio show possible.
[01:26:10.343 --> 01:26:11.604]  One of them is Ecolablue.
[01:26:12.164 --> 01:26:15.785]  Did you know that you could be drinking fresh, clean water made right out of the air you breathe?
[01:26:15.805 --> 01:26:17.506]  Now, this isn't something out of a science fiction book.
[01:26:17.546 --> 01:26:18.646]  Our sponsor, Ecolablue.
[01:26:18.706 --> 01:26:19.267]  They're Ecolablue 28.
[01:26:20.543 --> 01:26:20.683]  I think?
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:46.480]  Yes.
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:20.022]  It's a plug-and-play solar generator from Solutions from Science.
[01:27:20.062 --> 01:27:27.265]  These portable power systems need no installation and supply household current wherever and whenever you need it, producing electricity directly from the sun.
[01:27:27.305 --> 01:27:30.526]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly and emits no fumes.
[01:27:30.546 --> 01:27:34.508]  It's like having your own electrical power plant and it's perfect for your home or campsite.
[01:27:34.928 --> 01:27:39.690]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:46.573]  So check them out online at MySolarBackup.com or call for a free information package at 877-327-0365.
[01:27:47.214 --> 01:27:49.555]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:27:51.476 --> 01:27:52.917]  MySolarBackup.com.
[01:27:53.277 --> 01:27:55.038]  Okay, George, you got cut off by the break.
[01:27:55.538 --> 01:27:59.400]  And I want to go through the info that you wanted to talk about, you know, the facts of the economy.
[01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:00.401]  But before we run out of time,
[01:28:01.241 --> 01:28:13.945]  First, do you agree with Kaiser's analysis on the financial terrorism last week, and what's your take on what's happening with, first it's $150 billion, then it's $600 billion, then it's a trillion today.
[01:28:13.985 --> 01:28:17.806]  Now they're saying more than a trillion, and they won't even say where the money's going.
[01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:23.269]  Yeah, first of all, Max Keiser is amazing, and I really enjoyed and learned listening from him.
[01:28:23.810 --> 01:28:36.177]  And it was really funny because I brought into the show a bunch of information that said that the bailout was $147 billion, and on the way here I hear that's a trillion dollars for Europe.
[01:28:36.557 --> 01:28:41.821]  Now, the first thing that has to be understood is that this is not a bailout for Greece.
[01:28:42.773 --> 01:28:43.593]  Let me repeat this.
[01:28:43.653 --> 01:28:45.374]  This is not a bailout for Greece.
[01:28:45.754 --> 01:28:49.776]  This is a bailout for the banks of that region.
[01:28:51.697 --> 01:28:59.100]  The only people getting the shaft on this are the Greek people, and then it's going to be the Italian people, and then the Spanish people, and all the people of Europe.
[01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:03.362]  A one trillion dollar bailout right now.
[01:29:03.442 --> 01:29:08.724]  And the thing that must be remembered is that in the last week they keep talking about that
[01:29:09.384 --> 01:29:13.249]  The German and the French banks are the ones that are going to take this heaviest.
[01:29:13.309 --> 01:29:21.800]  Well, now it's my understanding that the IMF is good for about 27 to 35 percent of this trillion dollars.
[01:29:22.141 --> 01:29:24.243]  And guess who pays most of the IMF?
[01:29:24.884 --> 01:29:26.925]  The people of the United States.
[01:29:27.505 --> 01:29:34.729]  This so-called bailout is being paid for by you and by me and by your families.
[01:29:34.949 --> 01:29:37.710]  This is just absolutely insane.
[01:29:38.090 --> 01:29:45.814]  And that is why shows like this are so absolutely important because getting this information out has to be done.
[01:29:46.414 --> 01:30:09.263]  this is absolute criminal criminal behavior and as i have said over and over and over again no matter how much the bailouts no matter how many zeros you add you can't bail it out you can't fix something that's already dead with fractional reserve banking it is a dead system from the first day and right now
[01:30:10.103 --> 01:30:18.511]  The economies of Greece and Spain and Germany do not represent the real productivity or unproductivity of the country.
[01:30:18.531 --> 01:30:19.412]  And it's a black hole.
[01:30:19.432 --> 01:30:25.438]  The bankers brag over time to get you in debt, grow the size of the state, and then it all implodes into the black hole.
[01:30:25.979 --> 01:30:26.559]  Absolutely.
[01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:30.983]  And then also, of course, the size of government, you know, and I've been, I've been
[01:30:32.205 --> 01:30:39.871]  The total debt of Greece is 118% of the gross national product.
[01:30:39.891 --> 01:30:42.052]  The total debt of Italy is 122%.
[01:30:43.013 --> 01:30:50.599]  The average debt in the Western European Union is about 80% of the gross domestic product.
[01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:57.285]  Now that's not including their corporate debts, that's not including their private debts, that's not including some of the derivatives.
[01:30:57.705 --> 01:31:01.186]  Folks, their situation, it's gone, it's over, and it's done.
[01:31:01.467 --> 01:31:12.391]  And this does not even include the nations of Eastern Europe, countries like Romania and Ukraine, where you just start adding zeros and you just keep your finger on the plug.
[01:31:12.831 --> 01:31:14.072]  It's over and done.
[01:31:14.252 --> 01:31:15.072]  It won't work.
[01:31:15.152 --> 01:31:26.877]  They can shine it up as much as they want, but the reality is, is because they are using the same sort of economy, fiat currency, fractional reserve banking,
[01:31:27.802 --> 01:31:30.484]  Both systems, the U.S.
[01:31:30.544 --> 01:31:33.146]  dollar and the Euro are headed for disaster.
[01:31:33.266 --> 01:31:45.554]  Now I want you to go over that, but I want to direct all radio listeners to go to PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com, but Curt Nemo, Paul Watson and Steve Watson are on fire.
[01:31:45.915 --> 01:31:49.177]  I called them all this morning, I asked them to cover a whole bunch of key subjects.
[01:31:49.757 --> 01:31:50.638]  I sent them documents.
[01:31:50.658 --> 01:31:51.839]  They've already done their own research.
[01:31:52.359 --> 01:32:02.626]  There are a whole bunch of articles that are on the front page of PrisonPlanet.com that while you're talking, George, I'm going to have my guys go to the featured news stories and put them over the screen while you're talking.
[01:32:02.986 --> 01:32:13.773]  These are all so important so your friends, your family, your neighbors, people around you know why this is happening and that it's pre-destined and pre-planned by these criminals.
[01:32:14.093 --> 01:32:19.217]  Bankers, economists, mass centralization at heart of Euro bailout.
[01:32:19.837 --> 01:32:20.918]  That's government admitting that.
[01:32:21.398 --> 01:32:21.878]  Here's another one.
[01:32:21.938 --> 01:32:25.019]  Bankers destroy global economy by design to consolidate power.
[01:32:25.339 --> 01:32:26.239]  Another key article.
[01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:28.100]  Here's another one the guys wrote.
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:30.561]  All linked to direct statements.
[01:32:30.961 --> 01:32:31.601]  Ron Paul.
[01:32:31.721 --> 01:32:34.342]  Euro bailout will lead to currency collapse.
[01:32:34.883 --> 01:32:35.443]  Here's another one.
[01:32:35.543 --> 01:32:38.024]  Euro bailout fund is a desperate measure.
[01:32:38.724 --> 01:32:39.225]  Here's another one.
[01:32:57.219 --> 01:32:59.960]  And send them this list of articles.
[01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:02.181]  This is life and death information.
[01:33:02.241 --> 01:33:05.503]  Because if we just lay here and take these attacks, they win.
[01:33:05.783 --> 01:33:10.285]  But if we take this attack like Judo and use it against them, they have reached too far.
[01:33:10.625 --> 01:33:17.688]  They can fall just like Ceausescu, or just like Hitler, or just like so many other thugs throughout history.
[01:33:17.728 --> 01:33:18.909]  Bernie, Madoff, Ken Lay.
[01:33:19.989 --> 01:33:26.051]  I just wanted to cover those articles, tell folks that it's all documented there for them at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:33:26.071 --> 01:33:28.811]  George Humphrey, take us out to break in the next ten minutes.
[01:33:29.091 --> 01:33:31.352]  Break down the real economics of this.
[01:33:31.492 --> 01:33:33.573]  And again, I pointed this out last week.
[01:33:34.413 --> 01:33:39.134]  I remember, when did you put out your first audio book off your first book, Common Sense?
[01:33:39.394 --> 01:33:39.134]  1998.
[01:33:40.535 --> 01:33:43.415]  1998, I remember driving to San Antonio, listening on CDs.
[01:33:43.435 --> 01:33:48.957]  It was like eight hours long, of your book with that great radio host you had read it.
[01:33:50.051 --> 01:33:59.659]  And I remember learning about derivatives, learning how they were going to implode it to bring in a world government, how it was going to work, how they would set up the SDRs, and that was twelve years ago.
[01:33:59.679 --> 01:34:04.543]  I remember driving to San Antonio to interview the police chief, and driving back, listening to it, and learning so much.
[01:34:04.923 --> 01:34:06.725]  So, I'd like to give credit where credit's due.
[01:34:07.105 --> 01:34:08.446]  You're not just saying this.
[01:34:08.967 --> 01:34:09.967]  You understood this.
[01:34:10.308 --> 01:34:14.111]  You were one of the first people to specifically lay it out, and now you're laying it out again.
[01:34:14.171 --> 01:34:14.531]  Go ahead.
[01:34:14.651 --> 01:34:16.072]  Yeah, well, thank you very much, Alex.
[01:34:16.273 --> 01:34:17.173]  I appreciate that.
[01:34:17.994 --> 01:34:18.394]  Anyway, I
[01:34:20.433 --> 01:34:46.673]  Information is power there's no question about it and at the same time my job is to distill all that I have people I'm talking to from all over the country all over the world who are really really smart people and I'm taking this and I try and distill it and make it as simple as possible so that people can understand it and the reality is is that we are facing the largest economic tsunami in the history of modern
[01:34:47.413 --> 01:34:48.354]  Modern history.
[01:34:48.594 --> 01:34:52.998]  And all you have to do is look at seven basic facts.
[01:34:53.499 --> 01:35:11.776]  Number one is that the total debt in this country, federal, state, local, corporate, and personal debt, when you put those together, not including derivatives, is about 900% greater than the gross domestic product.
[01:35:12.359 --> 01:35:16.541]  And the percentages are getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.
[01:35:17.082 --> 01:35:21.144]  Just that alone assures that we cannot recover from this problem.
[01:35:21.744 --> 01:35:36.452]  Number two, is that the derivative situation, and anybody who says that they know how much there are in toxic derivatives, well maybe they know more than I do, but I've been studying this stuff for about 12 years and I don't know how much.
[01:35:36.472 --> 01:35:37.492]  Tarpley says 1.5 quadrillion.
[01:35:39.238 --> 01:35:40.879]  Yeah, and that's possible.
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:57.233]  Using the most conservative numbers, which is about $130 trillion of toxic derivatives, which is one-tenth of what Tarpley is saying, is that just alone destroys the ship, sinks the Titanic.
[01:35:57.633 --> 01:35:58.994]  It's all over and done with.
[01:36:00.097 --> 01:36:11.382]  In Japan in 1989, which is one of the most productive nations in the whole world, they had something very similar to derivatives and they went down much, much smaller in comparison.
[01:36:11.442 --> 01:36:19.946]  And even though Japan is one of the hardest working, most productive nations in the world, they have had 20 years of the Japan syndrome.
[01:36:20.346 --> 01:36:26.789]  Of recession, recession, recession, because they just keep feeding this monster instead of flushing this stuff out.
[01:36:27.409 --> 01:36:29.490]  Number three is the balance of trade.
[01:36:29.851 --> 01:36:38.394]  I come from a manufacturing family, and what made America great is that we used to make things.
[01:36:38.454 --> 01:36:40.555]  We used to make things and sell things.
[01:36:41.976 --> 01:36:45.798]  And manufacturing was what made this country strong.
[01:36:47.110 --> 01:36:52.974]  Just 35 years ago, manufacturing represented 43% of the economy.
[01:36:53.935 --> 01:36:57.698]  Today, it is about 9% of the economy.
[01:36:58.138 --> 01:37:06.004]  Friends, if you have a hot dog stand and you don't sell as many hot dogs as you buy in product and rent, you go broke.
[01:37:06.869 --> 01:37:19.494]  For the last twenty five years we have had over three hundred billion dollars per year at the minimum of a negative uh... trade balance and it was up to a eight hundred fifty billion dollars a year.
[01:37:20.035 --> 01:37:25.917]  This year it's about five hundred billion dollars which is about three percent of our economy year in year out that's going right out.
[01:37:26.377 --> 01:37:34.601]  Number four is that the government of this country, the state and local governments, federal governments
[01:37:36.128 --> 01:37:40.192]  In 1900, total represented about 4% of the GNP.
[01:37:40.572 --> 01:37:42.014]  Forty years ago, it was about 14%.
[01:37:43.315 --> 01:37:50.361]  Now, total government spending represents about 44-45% of the gross domestic product.
[01:37:50.762 --> 01:37:52.864]  This is way past the tipping point.
[01:37:52.984 --> 01:37:55.546]  And government last month became the biggest hire.
[01:37:56.247 --> 01:37:57.428]  No question.
[01:37:57.548 --> 01:37:59.550]  It's now creating more jobs in the private sector.
[01:37:59.790 --> 01:38:00.671]  Not even close.
[01:38:02.092 --> 01:38:05.594]  By definition, government is not productive.
[01:38:05.634 --> 01:38:08.216]  It is there supposedly to help the people.
[01:38:08.616 --> 01:38:13.759]  We are so fast, far past the tipping point as far as the size of government.
[01:38:14.039 --> 01:38:18.101]  You know, we used to point our fingers at Sweden and talk about socialism and all that.
[01:38:18.541 --> 01:38:19.702]  Folks, it's right here.
[01:38:19.722 --> 01:38:21.323]  The monster has come here.
[01:38:21.643 --> 01:38:23.004]  And it's not socialism.
[01:38:24.321 --> 01:38:36.276]  is fascism because the large multinational corporations have are are working together with the government and by definition that is not socialism that is fascism
[01:38:37.242 --> 01:38:41.826]  Um, unemployment in this country, you know, they say it's 10% baloney.
[01:38:41.846 --> 01:38:48.351]  It's closer to 16% and we now have 39.5 million people in this country.
[01:38:48.651 --> 01:38:52.534]  And I just heard on Alex just a little bit ago, it's now over 40 million people.
[01:38:53.374 --> 01:38:56.557]  40 million Americans are now on food stamps.
[01:38:56.857 --> 01:39:00.760]  That's one out of every 7.8 people, that's one out of 7.8 people.
[01:39:04.059 --> 01:39:05.891]  Friends, that's insane.
[01:39:06.475 --> 01:39:07.381]  You can't have that.
[01:39:08.766 --> 01:39:16.408]  Forty million people on food stamps, and they would be riding on the streets, and they've turned over the benefit package.
[01:39:16.488 --> 01:39:20.388]  There's this period of time that you get food stamps, and then you're supposed to go away.
[01:39:20.608 --> 01:39:24.489]  They've turned this over, not once or twice or three times, but four times.
[01:39:24.809 --> 01:39:33.211]  Obama knows that if he didn't keep turning this thing over, and that the middle class of this country kept paying for it, there would be rioting in the streets.
[01:39:33.311 --> 01:39:34.491]  Well, those are the new bread lines.
[01:39:34.511 --> 01:39:37.692]  Imagine 40 million people every day lining up at soup kitchens.
[01:39:38.092 --> 01:39:45.875]  You know, I watched the movie Gladiator the other day, and the old concept of bread and circus is so very real.
[01:39:46.196 --> 01:39:53.839]  The government is providing bread to the very poor and creating the golf channel and the basketball... The Romans did that!
[01:39:53.879 --> 01:39:54.859]  They had the dole!
[01:39:54.879 --> 01:39:55.920]  They handed free bread out!
[01:39:56.060 --> 01:40:06.144]  Absolutely, and when it was a republic, they used to have about 10 or 12 events in the Coliseum per year, but when it became an empire, it got up to 175
[01:40:07.805 --> 01:40:09.086]  Thousands of channels!
[01:40:29.136 --> 01:40:30.197]  Thousands of channels.
[01:40:30.578 --> 01:40:36.284]  And finally, the basic thing is, is that we have what's called the Federal Reserve Banking Act.
[01:40:36.865 --> 01:40:38.987]  It is not federal, there's no reserves.
[01:40:39.508 --> 01:40:48.639]  Our founding fathers were so astute, they knew that we had to have a decentralized, publicly owned money system to keep a free nation.
[01:40:49.199 --> 01:40:49.219]  I
[01:41:05.817 --> 01:41:06.378]  IMF.
[01:41:06.558 --> 01:41:15.645]  And boy, all those old-timers that told us they were going to bankrupt the country by design and turn us over to a world government, and they all got put on a list and called names, now it's on the news.
[01:41:15.705 --> 01:41:18.728]  We've got to have a world government, and you're going to pay your taxes to us.
[01:41:18.868 --> 01:41:21.030]  And so the economic tsunami is here.
[01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:33.540]  The water, as we're standing on this beach of our society, and the economy is the ocean, the economy has started pulling back further and further and further and further and further.
[01:41:34.454 --> 01:41:49.260]  Now, 15, 20 years ago, because we didn't have this information, because we didn't have the Alex Jones Shows to listen to, and the other shows, David Ickes, myself, and many others, it was understandable that people did not know what was going on.
[01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:50.601]  Now, if you've got
[01:41:51.361 --> 01:42:13.358]  Any sort of awareness or open-mindedness, you realize that what is happening right now is the water, the economic water, drawing back and getting ready to come rushing in on us and to create the chaos, the planned chaos of the destruction of the economy of not only the United States but of the Western world.
[01:42:14.179 --> 01:42:16.621]  And this is a planned event.
[01:42:17.301 --> 01:42:25.626]  Now, we can sit here and argue about it, and we can sit here and scratch about it, or we can look for seashells, or we can do what smart people do.
[01:42:25.987 --> 01:42:37.434]  We can take off in the tsunami relief routes and get up on high ground and take care of ourselves, because the whole system of this nation
[01:42:37.794 --> 01:42:44.238]  The economic, political, and cultural institutions of the United States of America are full of cancer.
[01:42:44.458 --> 01:42:45.179]  They're dying.
[01:42:45.299 --> 01:42:46.840]  They cannot be fixed.
[01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:52.343]  And they plan for it to collapse into a mega-tyranny, a tyranny the likes of which the planet's never seen.
[01:42:52.383 --> 01:42:53.083]  George Humphrey, stay there.
[01:42:53.103 --> 01:42:57.906]  We're gonna come back, finish up with your information, then open up phones in the next hour.
[01:42:58.447 --> 01:43:00.388]  This information could not be more important.
[01:43:00.408 --> 01:43:02.169]  We'll talk about those tsunami rockets.
[01:43:02.728 --> 01:43:06.090]  Headaches, allergies and asthma, chronic disease.
[01:43:06.610 --> 01:43:08.011]  Is your home making you sick?
[01:43:08.451 --> 01:43:09.051]  Here's a fact.
[01:43:09.391 --> 01:43:17.055]  Our indoor air quality is getting worse, and the causes include chemicals, toxic gases, dust, pollen, dander, and even chemtrail particulates.
[01:43:17.375 --> 01:43:24.198]  To rid your home of these contaminants, get the best-priced air purifiers in the industry at airfiltersandpurifiers.com.

[01:43:38.834 --> 01:43:39.034]  I think.
[01:44:01.022 --> 01:44:03.363]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:44:03.403 --> 01:44:05.604]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:44:05.724 --> 01:44:08.526]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:44:08.946 --> 01:44:13.688]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:44:14.048 --> 01:44:18.250]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:20.914]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:44:21.014 --> 01:44:23.438]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:44:23.798 --> 01:44:26.362]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:44:26.702 --> 01:44:34.314]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:44:34.634 --> 01:44:39.898]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:44:40.038 --> 01:44:42.820]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:46.323]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:44:46.563 --> 01:44:47.483]  And I got news for you.
[01:44:47.644 --> 01:44:48.945]  You're everyone else.
[01:44:48.985 --> 01:44:49.985]  Invisible Empire.

[01:45:54.891 --> 01:45:55.212]  It works!
[01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:11.822]  We have a decision to make as a society, as a species, the human race.
[01:46:11.842 --> 01:46:15.023]  The global controllers are going to try to play us off against each other.
[01:46:15.604 --> 01:46:17.584]  Race, religion, they're going to try to start new wars.
[01:46:18.305 --> 01:46:23.687]  I believe they're going to try to launch a new war against Iran in the midst of this global meltdown to get political support at home.
[01:46:24.128 --> 01:46:28.570]  That has people, you know, shift into this primitive mode of rallying around, you know, the chief.
[01:46:29.730 --> 01:46:31.651]  But I do see the system complaining.
[01:46:31.751 --> 01:46:34.653]  Obama and others are saying, Cass Sunstein's complaining.
[01:46:35.033 --> 01:46:36.974]  Oh my God, none of them listen to us anymore.
[01:46:37.375 --> 01:46:41.657]  The new Supreme Court nominee is anti-free speech, anti-Second Amendment.
[01:46:42.157 --> 01:46:56.165]  So they're definitely trying to come in with a tyranny, but I think all this bluster and this attempt to race us to the finish line is because they understand their time is running out and the awakening is accelerating.
[01:46:56.345 --> 01:47:04.304]  Yeah, Alex, I couldn't agree with you more and one of the things that we talked about is that you and I have been doing this for a long time and ten years ago I was
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:10.944]  Frankly, pretty frantic about what the future was for myself and my family and my country and my world.
[01:47:11.584 --> 01:47:26.315]  I am more positive today, even though I have a hundred times more information about the bad stuff, I'm more positive today about the future of what we as individuals, as part of God's creation, can do.
[01:47:26.715 --> 01:47:29.397]  And we do know that this economic tsunami is coming.
[01:47:29.777 --> 01:47:33.742]  So, we've got to chop wood and carry water and we've got to get to the high ground.
[01:47:34.042 --> 01:47:37.066]  So, what does a smart person do to get to the high ground?
[01:47:37.306 --> 01:47:39.429]  And I know you talk about this all the time.
[01:47:39.809 --> 01:47:41.291]  First thing, you've got to have a passport.
[01:47:41.431 --> 01:47:42.513]  Everybody's listening here.
[01:47:42.873 --> 01:47:44.455]  Get yourself a valid passport.
[01:47:44.916 --> 01:47:47.439]  Number two, get yourself out of debt.
[01:47:48.598 --> 01:47:53.140]  Get the ceiling on desires, cut your spending, and be more efficient.
[01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:59.702]  Number three, put at least 15% of your reserves in gold and silver bullion.
[01:47:59.802 --> 01:48:01.102]  Take care of yourself.
[01:48:01.182 --> 01:48:06.344]  Gold and silver have been a medium of exchange forever and ever and ever.
[01:48:06.864 --> 01:48:07.545]  Number four,
[01:48:08.285 --> 01:48:08.745]  We're good to go!
[01:48:27.671 --> 01:48:29.852]  Get your exercise every day.
[01:48:29.933 --> 01:48:31.213]  This is so important.
[01:48:31.594 --> 01:48:35.236]  Get outside and get that vitamin D and get out in nature.
[01:48:35.276 --> 01:48:38.178]  Go down to the Barton Creek Greenbelt and spend some time.
[01:48:38.758 --> 01:48:42.320]  Number five, probably, you know, create community.
[01:48:42.641 --> 01:48:49.885]  There's a heck of a lot more people out there who are feeling the same way you are about what's going on than you may realize.
[01:48:50.305 --> 01:48:52.287]  And as you drop, you know, as Jesus said,
[01:48:53.147 --> 01:48:55.028]  Separate the wheat from the chaff.
[01:48:55.048 --> 01:48:58.309]  There's a lot of people who just aren't going to get this stuff.
[01:48:59.110 --> 01:48:59.770]  And you know what?
[01:49:00.310 --> 01:49:04.792]  Some of my friends, I love them and God love them, they're going to go their own way.
[01:49:05.172 --> 01:49:15.036]  But I have created so many more new and vibrant friends who are aware of this stuff and who believe in America and who believe in the Republic and who believe in God.
[01:49:15.316 --> 01:49:16.397]  So create community.
[01:49:16.997 --> 01:49:18.518]  Then make sure
[01:49:19.358 --> 01:49:24.543]  That every day, in your own way, whatever way you do it, pray and meditate.
[01:49:24.683 --> 01:49:27.565]  Pray and meditate the attitude of gratitude.
[01:49:27.986 --> 01:49:29.187]  And finally... Yeah, slow down.
[01:49:29.247 --> 01:49:30.588]  Get out of the media mind control.
[01:49:30.989 --> 01:49:31.309]  Absolutely.
[01:49:31.329 --> 01:49:40.857]  Because they get us racing so fast all the time, we can't just calm down and look at how we've been slowly brought through these levels into this deep tyranny.
[01:49:41.018 --> 01:49:43.260]  And you know, one of the things I know Alex about
[01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:45.821]  Better than most of the people down here.
[01:49:45.861 --> 01:49:48.122]  And a lot of people see Alex the tough guy.
[01:49:48.442 --> 01:49:49.723]  And he is tough, I'll tell you what.
[01:49:49.863 --> 01:49:51.324]  Oh, let's not talk about man.
[01:49:51.404 --> 01:49:52.024]  I'll tell you what.
[01:49:52.344 --> 01:49:59.508]  Alex is doing this because he has a deep, deep, inviting connection with the highest creator.
[01:49:59.788 --> 01:50:01.568]  The Grand Organized Design.
[01:50:02.109 --> 01:50:04.830]  And that's why he's not here to make a bunch of money.
[01:50:04.850 --> 01:50:08.272]  You know, he's not here, you know, we all have our egos.
[01:50:08.292 --> 01:50:12.774]  But his basic thing is, is because he believes in the goodness in man.
[01:50:14.048 --> 01:50:20.453]  And the last thing is, the last thing, and the most important thing is, this is a great time to be alive!
[01:50:20.834 --> 01:50:23.416]  Wow, what an incredible time to be in body!
[01:50:24.036 --> 01:50:25.638]  All these things that are happening.
[01:50:26.078 --> 01:50:36.267]  And if you're afraid, and if you're in fear-based consciousness, these rascals, these vampires, these people who, who sow fear are gonna make you shrivel right up.
[01:50:36.507 --> 01:50:37.228]  But you know what?
[01:50:37.288 --> 01:50:39.349]  People like Alex, people like you.
[01:50:39.369 --> 01:50:40.470]  George, stay there, I got a break.
[01:50:40.650 --> 01:50:40.851]  Okay.
[01:50:41.831 --> 01:50:46.854]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[01:50:47.495 --> 01:50:49.896]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:50:50.096 --> 01:50:51.357]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:51.397 --> 01:50:56.740]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:50:56.980 --> 01:51:01.603]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:02.003 --> 01:51:07.026]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:07.566 --> 01:51:12.269]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:14.711]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:51:15.091 --> 01:51:19.714]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:19.914 --> 01:51:20.815]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:21.015 --> 01:51:23.797]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:24.097 --> 01:51:27.399]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:30.561]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:30.902 --> 01:51:32.803]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:33.123 --> 01:51:34.044]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:37.766 --> 01:51:39.827]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:41.909 --> 01:51:46.431]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:46.751 --> 01:51:49.213]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:54.556 --> 01:51:56.477]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:51:56.957 --> 01:51:59.719]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:52:07.136 --> 01:52:09.819]  It is already hour number four.
[01:52:10.940 --> 01:52:13.142]  Gordon Brown, the puppet of England, has stepped down.
[01:52:13.162 --> 01:52:18.007]  Now they're debating the new puppet that's going to be in power because the Parliament is hung.
[01:52:19.168 --> 01:52:21.330]  Angela Merkel has lost most of her seat.
[01:52:21.410 --> 01:52:22.952]  She's on the verge of being brought down.
[01:52:23.312 --> 01:52:25.054]  But still, they do what the bankers tell them.
[01:52:25.614 --> 01:52:28.237]  We're not just going to give the private bankers $150 million.
[01:52:28.277 --> 01:52:29.739]  It's going to be a trillion, maybe more!
[01:52:32.025 --> 01:52:34.127]  Nicholas Sarkozy almost lost control.
[01:52:34.187 --> 01:52:42.212]  He's backed off the carbon taxes, but he just rushes ahead without the global tax, just with a new tax where they just say a trillion is the private bankers.
[01:52:42.993 --> 01:52:46.656]  This is the global criminal consolidation of the economy.
[01:52:46.696 --> 01:52:53.801]  Max Keiser, amazing info last hour, breaking down that that was a Goldman Sachs government-run false flag attack last week.
[01:52:54.281 --> 01:52:57.129]  To kill legislation in Congress to break up the too big to fail.
[01:52:57.510 --> 01:53:01.059]  They now admit it wasn't the fat finger, it wasn't a mistake, but they're not going to investigate.
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:02.663]  That was a staged event.
[01:53:03.496 --> 01:53:05.416]  He talked about the computer systems they use to do it.
[01:53:05.857 --> 01:53:06.957]  Such incredible info.
[01:53:07.317 --> 01:53:08.237]  I want to go to your calls.
[01:53:08.257 --> 01:53:29.101]  We're going to get into a bunch of other issues here with George Humphrey, economist, good friend of mine, author, former Austin City Council member, who predicted this all with absolute precision twelve years ago in his book Common Sense and the audio CD set that, by the way, we carry at InfoWars.com, laying out derivatives that were designed to destroy the economy and consolidate power.
[01:53:29.621 --> 01:53:31.762]  But right now we're going to go to your calls and then get into some
[01:53:32.242 --> 01:53:38.968]  Other issues dealing with the psychology of the globalist, and a great analogy George was telling me during the break about vampires.
[01:53:39.128 --> 01:53:50.177]  Basically, that's the archetype we're dealing with, not real vampires, but the real vampires, the psychic and economic vampires, not the fake Count Dracula vampires.
[01:53:50.877 --> 01:53:53.239]  Let's go ahead and talk to Josh in Colorado.
[01:53:53.559 --> 01:53:54.420]  Josh, you're on the air.
[01:53:54.460 --> 01:53:54.800]  Welcome.
[01:53:56.162 --> 01:53:56.762]  Thank you, sir.
[01:53:56.822 --> 01:53:59.104]  God be the glory for what we're all trying to do here.
[01:53:59.813 --> 01:54:15.882]  Um, I wanted to get your guys' take on something that had happened to my wife a couple weeks ago, and it had to do with a couple of bank representatives, um, not looking like bank representatives coming to our house and asking us for donations for bailing out the bank so that they can create new jobs.
[01:54:16.622 --> 01:54:18.283]  It was probably just total con artists.
[01:54:18.623 --> 01:54:22.405]  I mean, the con artist behavior, crime of all sorts, is just exploding.
[01:54:23.246 --> 01:54:24.346]  Well, no, but check this out, though.
[01:54:24.367 --> 01:54:26.348]  This is what was really bizarre, according to my wife.
[01:54:27.523 --> 01:54:36.347]  The one she explained her situation, which was that she was against what the government, the NWO, and what the banks were doing with this country, her total demeanor changed.
[01:54:36.447 --> 01:54:39.209]  She got really defensive, really scared.
[01:54:39.929 --> 01:54:48.954]  She had a clipboard of a bunch of names, but what she did with our particular situation was she flipped over the clipboard and she had a column of three different columns and she put us in one of these brackets.
[01:54:49.778 --> 01:54:54.861]  My wife didn't get a chance to see what it was about, but she said just the entire situation.
[01:55:20.198 --> 01:55:22.801]  Well, first of all, don't let people into your house like that.
[01:55:23.101 --> 01:55:26.083]  And secondly, there have always been pirates.
[01:55:26.124 --> 01:55:27.805]  There's cons everywhere.
[01:55:28.425 --> 01:55:34.351]  And we have to have the internal strength and the determination to say no to this stuff.
[01:55:34.971 --> 01:55:38.854]  And as time goes on, there's going to be more and more and more scams.
[01:55:39.235 --> 01:55:40.856]  And we have to be more and more discerning.
[01:55:40.896 --> 01:55:42.057]  Yeah, I don't answer my door.
[01:55:42.638 --> 01:55:45.120]  I've got glass, you know, there on the side of my door where I can look out.
[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:47.001]  And I walk up and I say, hi, what do you need?
[01:55:47.842 --> 01:55:50.805]  And, uh, and they start saying, I just, I just walk away.
[01:55:50.825 --> 01:55:51.585]  I don't even respond.
[01:55:52.066 --> 01:55:54.628]  And then a few times they keep, you know, dinging the doorbell when I walk.
[01:55:54.708 --> 01:56:04.916]  I mean, and that's why it's good to have a, you know, at least a screen door or burglar bars, but now they're passing laws all over where you can't have them because the government criminals don't want you to protect yourself and they're looking out for their low level criminals.
[01:56:05.276 --> 01:56:07.398]  But, you know, just tell somebody, get off my porch.
[01:56:08.052 --> 01:56:26.882]  Yeah, so just taking care of your property, and it still is your property, and just realize that there's 39 million people on food stamps, and that there are 30 million illegals in this country, and there's an incredible number of people who are hungry and scamming in every single way.
[01:56:26.942 --> 01:56:30.003]  So, you know, just be aware and just say no and take care of yourself.
[01:56:30.023 --> 01:56:30.483]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:56:30.523 --> 01:56:31.364]  Here's another example.
[01:56:31.764 --> 01:56:37.327]  See, having you go through checkpoints, body scanners, ask questions, TSA admits that was training for the streets.
[01:56:37.447 --> 01:56:39.028]  Now they're going to have federal teams doing it.
[01:56:39.529 --> 01:56:42.170]  That's the same thing with the census asking, do you own guns?
[01:56:42.250 --> 01:56:43.011]  What's your toilet?
[01:56:43.371 --> 01:56:44.532]  Do you have stocks and bonds?
[01:56:44.772 --> 01:56:47.053]  Everybody doesn't get that, but some families do.
[01:56:47.774 --> 01:56:48.414]  Well, here it is.
[01:56:49.655 --> 01:56:52.696]  Volunteer census worker charged with burglary and rape in Indiana.
[01:56:53.077 --> 01:56:53.717]  Here's another one.
[01:56:54.077 --> 01:56:55.058]  Houston Police Department.
[01:56:55.098 --> 01:56:58.680]  Man killed in home invasion after suspect poses as census worker.
[01:56:58.940 --> 01:57:00.161]  Don't answer the door, folks.
[01:57:00.481 --> 01:57:05.883]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:57:07.124 --> 01:57:11.886]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:57:12.266 --> 01:57:27.373]  There's a place down in Tennessee Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[01:57:29.489 --> 01:57:33.370]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.

[01:57:57.655 --> 01:57:58.155]  Others don't.
[01:58:04.105 --> 01:58:05.026]  Tyranny is here.
[01:58:05.366 --> 01:58:09.048]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:58:09.228 --> 01:58:11.490]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:16.973]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on Earth.
[01:58:17.393 --> 01:58:23.617]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:58:24.057 --> 01:58:29.601]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.

[01:58:48.012 --> 01:58:49.433]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:58:49.973 --> 01:58:50.414]  It's here.

[01:59:22.044 --> 01:59:22.884]  Listen carefully.

[02:00:01.081 --> 02:00:03.263]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:00:03.804 --> 02:00:06.707]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:07.408 --> 02:00:07.788]  You know what?
[02:00:07.808 --> 02:00:15.576]  We're just going to have economist, former Austin City Council member, author, filmmaker, George Humphrey with us for the rest of the hour talking about the economy.
[02:00:15.937 --> 02:00:17.178]  We appreciate him spending so much time with us.
[02:00:17.198 --> 02:00:18.299]  We're going to have open phones.
[02:00:18.699 --> 02:00:23.464]  I'm going to get into some separate subjects before he leaves, like all these speeches by the illegal alien supporters.
[02:00:24.265 --> 02:00:24.605]  Hello Alex.
[02:00:24.625 --> 02:00:26.846]  First I'd like to say I just love you.
[02:00:26.946 --> 02:00:27.966]  You are such an angel.
[02:00:27.986 --> 02:00:28.786]  You're a true godsend.
[02:00:49.728 --> 02:00:56.236]  And I'd like to say, well, about me, I'm a first generation Latina and I'm a professional.
[02:00:56.316 --> 02:00:59.459]  I'm in the real estate business and it's in New York.
[02:00:59.539 --> 02:01:04.285]  So I know a lot about what's going on with the Latino immigrants in the community.
[02:01:05.515 --> 02:01:06.956]  So I'd like to share that with you.
[02:01:07.136 --> 02:01:10.858]  Well, it's funny that I brought that subject up right now, not knowing you were about to bring that up.
[02:01:11.178 --> 02:01:19.903]  But I did a whole show for those who just joined us yesterday about just, you know, I've protested the Klan many times in Austin and Waco and San Antonio.
[02:01:19.983 --> 02:01:20.863]  I'm against that group.
[02:01:21.304 --> 02:01:23.285]  And then I see it's so acceptable now.
[02:01:23.325 --> 02:01:26.987]  And Robert Rodriguez, who I've met and I'm a fan of, putting this new film out, Machete,
[02:01:27.427 --> 02:01:38.289]  That implies whites are basically racist and there's a big Mexican uprising and I've talked to Hispanics that say that more and more of the, especially Mexican immigrants, are trying to pressure Mexican-Americans.
[02:01:38.870 --> 02:01:42.970]  Kids can't wear, including Hispanics, you know, on Cinco de Mayo American flag shirts.
[02:01:43.230 --> 02:01:45.531]  It's so upsetting to these groups.
[02:01:45.791 --> 02:01:47.131]  How was this instilled in them?
[02:01:47.151 --> 02:01:50.192]  So, yeah, please give us a report on what you witnessed.
[02:01:51.181 --> 02:02:00.929]  Okay, what I'm seeing is that there are a lot of Arizona Mexican immigrants moving into the community, so they're moving into New York, especially Queens, New York.
[02:02:01.830 --> 02:02:07.434]  And for the most part, they are enslaved, and they are not able to enjoy life fully.
[02:02:07.714 --> 02:02:14.320]  And what they do is they raise money and send it to their families back wherever they're from, mostly Mexicans is what I'm referring to.
[02:02:14.340 --> 02:02:14.500]  Yes.
[02:02:16.539 --> 02:02:19.820]  I don't see them to have so much hate in their heart as that movie portrays.
[02:02:20.140 --> 02:02:21.160]  I agree with you.
[02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:26.361]  I mean, I took nothing but calls from Hispanics yesterday and every one of them said what you're saying.
[02:02:26.401 --> 02:02:31.922]  So this is, it looks like it's the media magnifying this to create this illusion.
[02:02:31.982 --> 02:02:33.002]  Why do you think they're doing that?
[02:02:34.142 --> 02:02:35.882]  Um, I believe it's all political.
[02:02:36.202 --> 02:02:39.443]  It's to bring down the country and divide us in three parts.
[02:02:40.123 --> 02:02:45.984]  Uh, to hurt the, you know, people like me who are American, Latin Americans, first generation, very proud of
[02:02:46.411 --> 02:02:46.932]  I don't think so.
[02:03:06.509 --> 02:03:09.290]  Well, that's what the Hispanic members of the crew told me.
[02:03:09.890 --> 02:03:24.274]  They're concerned because they believe it will create a negative backlash on Hispanics, but me talking about, you know, the Robert Rodriguez trailer saying this is a message for Arizona, that it shows the whites as all racist and being hacked up by machetes, that was only a small part of it.
[02:03:24.534 --> 02:03:32.016]  Then I played the clip from UCLA with him up there going, I love my students, we're communists, the whites are evil, we're going to get them.
[02:03:33.396 --> 02:03:50.485]  You know, my issue is the government and the universities are backing that view, and most of the Hispanic callers agreed yesterday, and they said, I've been called a pocho, if I'm pronouncing it right, which means a sellout if I have an American flag, if I decide I want to be part of this country.
[02:03:50.505 --> 02:03:54.127]  And that's not saying America's perfect, but the idea of America.
[02:03:54.307 --> 02:03:58.770]  I mean, have you ever been pressured by anybody, or you're saying you don't even find this anywhere?
[02:04:00.117 --> 02:04:04.458]  Well, for the most part, I've never actually believed... I'm like you.
[02:04:04.538 --> 02:04:08.299]  I've never really believed that there is a, you know, two parties.
[02:04:08.359 --> 02:04:10.859]  I've always thought they're all just a puppet.
[02:04:11.479 --> 02:04:17.601]  But out here, for the most part, they're very docile people over here in the New York area.
[02:04:18.041 --> 02:04:23.982]  They're very docile and very grateful to their, you know, whoever they're working for, and they're very good tenants.
[02:04:24.622 --> 02:04:26.423]  Because, like I said, I'm in the real estate field.
[02:04:26.823 --> 02:04:28.543]  What I do notice is they're not active
[02:04:29.276 --> 02:04:34.741]  They're not doing what they're doing out there in your part of the country, like in California, Arizona.
[02:04:35.201 --> 02:04:37.023]  That over there is a lot of lying.
[02:04:37.163 --> 02:04:57.340]  I heard your show yesterday, you know, the last show you had on that topic, and what I can tell you is that guy, I saw him, the one from that university, UCLA, that professor, Latino, he's full of it, because as far as him saying that he's the northern front inside the belly of the beast, and that he's just the beginning of Latin America,
[02:04:57.867 --> 02:05:04.372]  Well, I'm from South America originally, and especially Ecuador, so that's where my parents are from.
[02:05:04.832 --> 02:05:05.753]  Totally false.
[02:05:06.153 --> 02:05:08.055]  I mean, South America?
[02:05:08.075 --> 02:05:12.919]  They're not interested in that kind of axis.
[02:05:12.939 --> 02:05:14.540]  They don't want that kind of union.
[02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:16.081]  They don't care what goes on over here.
[02:05:16.101 --> 02:05:18.763]  Well, I said something good about Hugo Chavez four years ago.
[02:05:19.084 --> 02:05:22.226]  He led the coalition to stop the American Union.
[02:05:22.246 --> 02:05:25.909]  I mean, it was openly being formed, and Hugo Chavez killed that.
[02:05:26.329 --> 02:05:34.120]  I don't like the fact that he's starting to restrict free speech and do other things, and I don't believe in socialism, but I agree he's certainly not the New World Order.
[02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:35.502]  Ma'am, I appreciate your call.
[02:05:35.582 --> 02:05:36.283]  Very revealing.
[02:05:36.323 --> 02:05:37.184]  God bless you, Laura.
[02:05:38.566 --> 02:05:39.888]  George Humphrey, you wanted to comment on this.
[02:05:41.098 --> 02:05:42.499]  A special insight on this.
[02:05:43.139 --> 02:05:46.582]  My former wife is from Jalisco, from Puerto Vallarta.
[02:05:46.822 --> 02:05:51.325]  I've been down to Mexico at least once or twice a year for the last 25 years.
[02:05:51.906 --> 02:05:54.848]  My kids speak puro, puro, puro Espanol.
[02:05:55.888 --> 02:05:59.911]  My in-laws down in Mexico are some of the finest people on this planet.
[02:06:00.011 --> 02:06:02.513]  They're also very, very involved in the
[02:06:03.253 --> 02:06:06.036]  Uh, political parties down there, they know what's going on.
[02:06:06.596 --> 02:06:08.798]  And they just say, you know what?
[02:06:09.298 --> 02:06:14.242]  America is the only country in the world with open borders.
[02:06:14.723 --> 02:06:15.763]  We've got what?
[02:06:15.783 --> 02:06:17.925]  20 to 30 million illegals in this country.
[02:06:17.985 --> 02:06:19.827]  We don't know exactly how many there are.
[02:06:20.167 --> 02:06:24.631]  This is the only nation on the planet that allows this.
[02:06:25.592 --> 02:06:30.714]  And it's not the problem of the Mexicans or the Central Americans coming up here.
[02:06:30.754 --> 02:06:35.116]  If I was from Ecuador, I'd probably come up here myself and want to come up here.
[02:06:35.616 --> 02:06:40.058]  But the point is that every country needs to take care of itself.
[02:06:40.998 --> 02:06:57.241]  Well, the globalists are radicalizing, and they're trying to use it as a weapon, and these communist groups are saying, they want to get me, I'm evil, I'm white, they're going to get my guns, they're going to get my kids, and I'm saying, look, I'm not against you because you've got brown skin, but when you start saying you want to kill me, you've got a problem.
[02:06:57.401 --> 02:06:59.981]  And there's another fact that goes into this.
[02:07:00.421 --> 02:07:05.682]  Eighty-three percent of all first-generational Latin Americans who are now U.S.
[02:07:05.742 --> 02:07:08.083]  citizens are for real
[02:07:10.986 --> 02:07:12.107]  Immigration reform.
[02:07:12.187 --> 02:07:17.731]  They know that a balkanized America is not a good America.
[02:07:17.751 --> 02:07:20.654]  Well, the government wants to make sure people don't integrate.
[02:07:21.054 --> 02:07:22.435]  But they want to keep everybody in their group.
[02:07:22.695 --> 02:07:23.095]  Absolutely.
[02:07:23.115 --> 02:07:24.597]  That's why they're against everybody learning English.
[02:07:24.817 --> 02:07:25.898]  You know, it's amazing.
[02:07:26.118 --> 02:07:29.921]  Eighty-five, ninety percent of Americans are hip to what's going on.
[02:07:29.961 --> 02:07:31.162]  They want to close the borders.
[02:07:31.202 --> 02:07:32.362]  They want to protect things.
[02:07:32.803 --> 02:07:34.164]  It's the media and the government.
[02:07:34.224 --> 02:07:35.645]  The Democrats want to bring in
[02:07:36.164 --> 02:07:43.468]  New imports because it's the only source of new votes and Republicans want to do it to keep things messed up and to keep wages low.
[02:07:43.828 --> 02:07:47.630]  And we aborted 50 million Americans and so we have to have this new workforce.
[02:07:48.310 --> 02:07:53.633]  I mean, we killed, I mean, 50 plus percent of blacks have never been born since 73.
[02:07:53.693 --> 02:07:53.893]  Sick.
[02:07:53.933 --> 02:07:56.834]  I mean, it's sick.
[02:07:57.835 --> 02:07:59.116]  I mean, this is death.
[02:08:02.859 --> 02:08:04.280]  Let's go ahead and thank you, Laura.
[02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:06.201]  Let's talk to Margaret in Oklahoma.
[02:08:06.221 --> 02:08:07.082]  You're on the air, Margaret.
[02:08:08.142 --> 02:08:08.702]  Hello.
[02:08:09.203 --> 02:08:11.484]  I have four questions I want to ask real fast.
[02:08:12.144 --> 02:08:18.368]  Schaefer Cox, I saw a meeting he had in Montana, he had in December.
[02:08:18.928 --> 02:08:23.691]  I saw it and I looked on the internet to see more about him and he said he was in jail
[02:08:24.246 --> 02:08:28.829]  He had something called the Liberty Bell that all his supporters were supposed to come and help him out.
[02:08:28.849 --> 02:08:32.151]  I don't know who Schaefer Cox is, ma'am, so I can't really comment on that.
[02:08:32.171 --> 02:08:32.911]  What else?
[02:08:33.592 --> 02:08:34.712]  Oh, okay.
[02:08:36.534 --> 02:08:37.474]  A second one, Haiti.
[02:08:37.754 --> 02:08:42.938]  I was wondering about Haiti, because is it really, is it possible that those people were actually murdered?
[02:08:43.418 --> 02:08:53.324]  Because I was living in a country in, this is called East Pakistan, a few years ago, and the military went door-to-door murdering people.
[02:08:54.421 --> 02:09:08.130]  Well, I know Haiti is an incredible police state, Margaret, and that's the whole point, is that America isn't perfect, and now it's been seized as an engine of global domination, so people can point at America and say we're bad, but we've gone against our Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:09:08.450 --> 02:09:10.991]  It's still the best, and that's why the globalists want to pull it down.
[02:09:11.732 --> 02:09:21.418]  Yeah, but the CIA was probably behind what happened in East Pakistan, but the CIA has, like, drug
[02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:26.762]  Margaret, I hear you and I agree with you.
[02:09:27.503 --> 02:09:36.752]  Eric Prince said that Blackwater wasn't in Pakistan killing people and then he gave a speech and got recorded at Vanity Fair Hazard where he was saying they're in Pakistan.
[02:09:36.972 --> 02:09:42.558]  It's just non-stop and now they don't deny that our government grows the opium, they just admit it like it's a good thing.
[02:09:42.938 --> 02:09:46.862]  I'm over in India and Southeast Asia every year for a couple months a year.
[02:09:47.463 --> 02:09:51.247]  And there's no question that black water is over there.
[02:09:51.287 --> 02:09:52.909]  There's no question that the U.S.
[02:09:52.949 --> 02:09:59.296]  government is growing the opium, just like the British East India Bay Company used to grow the opium.
[02:09:59.676 --> 02:10:03.901]  You know how Franklin Delano Roosevelt's family made all their palatial wealth?
[02:10:04.101 --> 02:10:04.362]  Opium!
[02:10:04.822 --> 02:10:05.222]  Opium.
[02:10:05.262 --> 02:10:16.805]  The Delano family brought the opium from Southeast Asia to China and kept China totally, totally addicted to opium for over a hundred years.
[02:10:16.845 --> 02:10:17.786]  No, they know what they're doing.
[02:10:17.806 --> 02:10:21.927]  The government ships it in, and then SWAT teams any fool that they think has it.
[02:10:22.407 --> 02:10:23.967]  Let's go to Stewart in New York.
[02:10:23.987 --> 02:10:24.787]  Stewart, you're on the air.
[02:10:25.388 --> 02:10:26.688]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:10:27.528 --> 02:10:33.950]  It seems that mass fear and confusion can only help our friends in the New World Order.
[02:10:35.028 --> 02:10:39.171]  Who was it that said that it's a shame to waste a good disaster?
[02:10:39.191 --> 02:10:40.692]  I'm just paraphrasing that.
[02:10:41.312 --> 02:10:42.213]  It was Rahm Emanuel.
[02:10:42.233 --> 02:10:44.374]  He says you don't want a good crisis to go to waste.
[02:10:44.715 --> 02:10:47.296]  Well, it seems we've got two on the horizon now.
[02:10:47.356 --> 02:10:56.563]  In addition to the economic crisis, I'd like to go back to what's happening in the Gulf of Mexico and the volcano situation.
[02:10:57.343 --> 02:10:59.464]  You had touched on the possibility that
[02:11:00.549 --> 02:11:04.171]  What happened in the Gulf was not an accident.
[02:11:04.771 --> 02:11:10.694]  And if you remember what happened at 9-11, who benefits?
[02:11:11.494 --> 02:11:19.218]  There is some talk going around that in fact it wasn't an accident and it's coming from what I consider to be reliable sources.
[02:11:20.058 --> 02:11:20.758]  Who benefits?
[02:11:21.439 --> 02:11:23.780]  Let's look at our friends in North Korea.
[02:11:25.260 --> 02:11:27.541]  If there's anything that you can do as far as tracing
[02:11:29.725 --> 02:11:37.754]  Short options in the stock exchanges like we did with the airlines when 9-11 happened.
[02:11:38.475 --> 02:11:40.257]  I would sincerely appreciate that.
[02:11:42.239 --> 02:11:46.344]  With the volcanoes, it's going to shorten the growing seasons.
[02:11:47.476 --> 02:11:50.378]  Are you tired of out-of-control, irresponsible federal deficit spending?
[02:11:50.398 --> 02:11:52.659]  Increasing the money supply without increasing productive output leads to inflation.
[02:11:52.679 --> 02:11:53.540]  You get less for your money.
[02:11:53.580 --> 02:11:58.903]  If you want to protect the buying power of dollars for your future, then call Peter May at Midas Resources.
[02:12:16.414 --> 02:12:16.874]  I think so.
[02:12:39.844 --> 02:12:41.546]  We're good to go.
[02:13:00.527 --> 02:13:01.627]  Are you prepared?
[02:13:01.907 --> 02:13:03.988]  Well, you need to be hardcore prepared.
[02:13:04.208 --> 02:13:05.268]  There is a difference.
[02:13:05.588 --> 02:13:11.169]  To be hardcore prepared, equip yourself with the latest survival gear available at tacktowngear.com.
[02:13:11.450 --> 02:13:14.410]  All Tactown gear has been field tested by Canadian and U.S.
[02:13:14.450 --> 02:13:16.131]  forces, so you know it's tough.
[02:13:16.271 --> 02:13:17.211]  What kind of gear?
[02:13:17.231 --> 02:13:20.091]  72-hour survival kits as low as $55, holsters for $21, and
[02:13:22.472 --> 02:13:22.832]  I think so.
[02:13:42.188 --> 02:13:45.573]  Visit tacktowngear.com right now for your preparedness needs.
[02:13:45.813 --> 02:13:48.557]  That's T-A-C-T-O-W-N-G-E-A-R dot com.

[02:13:52.342 --> 02:13:52.983]  Again, that's 418-844-9111.
[02:14:04.685 --> 02:14:05.626]  Tyranny is here.
[02:14:05.946 --> 02:14:09.528]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:14:09.888 --> 02:14:12.110]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:14:12.130 --> 02:14:17.553]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[02:14:17.993 --> 02:14:24.197]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:14:24.637 --> 02:14:30.201]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:14:30.621 --> 02:14:34.303]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:14:34.803 --> 02:14:38.786]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:14:39.086 --> 02:14:44.650]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:14:45.030 --> 02:14:48.032]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:14:48.592 --> 02:14:49.973]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:14:50.553 --> 02:14:51.034]  It's here.

[02:16:00.718 --> 02:16:04.301]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now.
[02:16:08.388 --> 02:16:17.423]  We're going to continue with your phone calls.
[02:16:17.443 --> 02:16:20.748]  The controllers win if they can
[02:16:22.751 --> 02:16:26.095]  Manipulate the political debate and give you false choices.
[02:16:26.115 --> 02:16:29.660]  If they control the field, they own the horse track, they own the horses, they win.
[02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:35.367]  We have to realize that this whole game is rigged and then offer an alternative to people.
[02:16:35.708 --> 02:16:39.773]  The average American's been taught things are so bad because the American system doesn't work.
[02:16:39.893 --> 02:16:40.033]  No.
[02:16:41.054 --> 02:16:57.004]  I mean, if I buy a new car and it's got the engine, you know, the way it's supposed to run, it's got oil in it, it's got all the belts on it, and I'm driving, you know, I drive it around for 50,000 miles and it never has a problem, and then I drain the oil out and remove a belt, it's not going to work!
[02:16:58.244 --> 02:17:02.607]  So we have to fix it instead of going into this globalist system.
[02:17:03.387 --> 02:17:07.410]  But, George, you were talking about how vampires and fables
[02:17:08.666 --> 02:17:11.248]  Have to tell you what they're going to do to you before you do it.
[02:17:11.568 --> 02:17:33.523]  And we've seen this in countless government productions like Lone Gunman, the X-Files spinoff, and I was later approached by Dean Haglund, who was the star of the show, and he said, no, the CIA came to us, he's been in studio, and basically said, you know, we want this in these storylines, where the government remote controls a jet into the World Trade Centers as a pretext to start a war, and they use a drill to make NORAD stand down.
[02:17:33.963 --> 02:17:38.586]  Why do they love to tell us what they're going to do to us beforehand?
[02:17:39.786 --> 02:17:46.388]  Well, last night I went to a movie, and of the six trailers that were on, four of these were vampire movies.
[02:17:46.448 --> 02:17:57.031]  Now, the statistical probability of 80% of the movies that are coming out are about vampires is about zero.
[02:17:57.671 --> 02:18:01.012]  And the vampire movie... That's all I see is trailers and books!
[02:18:01.092 --> 02:18:03.093]  It is vampire, vampire, vampire!
[02:18:03.113 --> 02:18:07.074]  Television, movies, everything.
[02:18:07.990 --> 02:18:19.956]  And the reality is, is that that's there because they, the Illuminati, and when I say they, those in separation consciousness, those who are in fear-based consciousness, what we call the Illuminati.
[02:18:19.996 --> 02:18:20.876]  They're sadomasochists.
[02:18:21.176 --> 02:18:31.101]  Is that they believe in their own set of rules, that they have to tell the victims what they're going to do before they do it to make it okay.
[02:18:31.361 --> 02:18:33.682]  Just like the movie Wag the Dog.
[02:18:34.002 --> 02:18:36.926]  It was incredible, and most of y'all know about that movie.
[02:18:36.966 --> 02:18:37.267]  Tell them!
[02:18:37.347 --> 02:18:40.612]  It came out right before they actually ran a Wag the Dog in Serbia.
[02:18:41.192 --> 02:18:45.739]  Well, it was a movie about a president who was having trouble, a lot of political trouble.
[02:18:45.799 --> 02:18:49.825]  He was having an affair with one of his secretaries and that he...
[02:18:50.876 --> 02:19:04.887]  And that he created a war in Eastern Europe to get the minds of the people of America off what his... And they used a little girl running through rubble as the excuse when it turns out they lied about babies in incubators.
[02:19:05.147 --> 02:19:06.348]  They always put out a fake story.
[02:19:06.428 --> 02:19:07.129]  All this stuff.
[02:19:07.589 --> 02:19:10.291]  The whole movie was in the can.
[02:19:11.332 --> 02:19:18.158]  Six months before the Clinton allegations with Monica Lewinsky and what happened in Eastern Europe.
[02:19:18.258 --> 02:19:20.660]  I mean, it boggles the mind.
[02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:30.667]  When you and I started doing our stuff on 9-11, three days before on television there was a television show about an airliner going into the World Trade Center.
[02:19:31.168 --> 02:19:31.748]  Duh!
[02:19:32.409 --> 02:19:40.355]  I mean, they had oil storm four months before Katrina, even with the mayor in the show with the exact same thing happening.
[02:19:40.435 --> 02:19:58.398]  We can go on and on and on and on and on, but the archetype is that our so-called controllers are in separation consciousness, and they believe that only by materialism, by taking the blood of the people, the peasants, can they become more powerful.
[02:19:58.438 --> 02:20:00.199]  And of course, this is an archetype.
[02:20:00.779 --> 02:20:05.600]  Now, clearly, clearly, clearly, they're also telling us there's two ways to stop them.
[02:20:06.365 --> 02:20:08.245]  With silver and with crosses.
[02:20:08.866 --> 02:20:10.066]  They're telling us what to do.
[02:20:10.126 --> 02:20:12.366]  The cross represents spirituality.
[02:20:13.167 --> 02:20:27.570]  If you believe in God, and if you know that the grand organized design is going to protect our souls, and you stand up and look these people in the eye and say, I am in the light of God, there is no way you can hurt me, and silver.
[02:20:27.850 --> 02:20:29.131]  Silver and gold are the
[02:20:30.831 --> 02:20:48.577]  the ways that intelligent people have traded forever and of course they want us to get away from silver and gold with all this but it's not enough to have the cross and have the gold of the silver werewolf silver bullet yes you've got to have the will uh... look in the eye and say be gone
[02:20:48.697 --> 02:20:49.557]  You have to stand up.
[02:20:49.878 --> 02:20:50.338]  Absolutely.
[02:20:50.358 --> 02:20:56.321]  What's the uh... Abel Lugosi one where he's saying you have a strong will for one who's only lived one life.
[02:20:56.561 --> 02:20:57.922]  You have to stand up against him too.
[02:20:57.942 --> 02:21:02.285]  Yeah, and let me say this because I believe this very strongly.
[02:21:02.985 --> 02:21:05.286]  We humans, we are not victims.
[02:21:05.466 --> 02:21:08.208]  We as the citizens of this country are not victims.
[02:21:08.588 --> 02:21:10.709]  God does not create junk.
[02:21:11.110 --> 02:21:15.852]  If we allow the good energy, the loving energy, the healthy energy
[02:21:17.313 --> 02:21:22.597]  Of the Republic to come through us, of the consciousness of nature, of the consciousness of goodness.
[02:21:22.997 --> 02:21:25.479]  We can stop any and all of this craziness.
[02:21:26.139 --> 02:21:29.021]  We're gonna come back and finish up talking about mindsets and attitude.
[02:21:29.381 --> 02:21:32.824]  People, number one, have to know the facts, but then they have to have
[02:21:33.800 --> 02:21:35.881]  The understanding that we are incredibly powerful.
[02:21:35.921 --> 02:21:39.243]  The globalists see us not as little pathetic weak things.
[02:21:39.543 --> 02:21:41.264]  They see us as 800 foot giants.
[02:21:41.544 --> 02:21:42.564]  They're scared to death of us.
[02:21:42.584 --> 02:21:49.208]  That's why they got TV and movies and cultures and drugs in our water and food to try to suppress us because they're horrified of us.
[02:21:50.969 --> 02:21:51.869]  We're on the march.
[02:21:52.369 --> 02:21:53.970]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:21:54.911 --> 02:21:57.592]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:22:42.765 --> 02:22:44.707]  Visit their link at InfoWars.com.
[02:22:45.127 --> 02:22:46.388]  Look for Max, the orange
[02:22:46.448 --> 02:22:46.769]  I think so.
[02:23:00.609 --> 02:23:02.910]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:23:02.930 --> 02:23:05.191]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:23:05.291 --> 02:23:08.133]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:23:08.513 --> 02:23:13.256]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:23:13.616 --> 02:23:17.818]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:23:18.138 --> 02:23:20.481]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:23:20.581 --> 02:23:23.004]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:23:23.024 --> 02:23:25.927]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:23:26.267 --> 02:23:33.856]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:23:34.213 --> 02:23:39.478]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:23:39.598 --> 02:23:42.401]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:23:42.461 --> 02:23:45.885]  So it's gonna be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:23:46.145 --> 02:23:47.046]  And I got news for you.
[02:23:47.226 --> 02:23:48.527]  You're everyone else.
[02:23:48.567 --> 02:23:49.548]  Invisible Empire.

[02:23:59.924 --> 02:24:00.545]  Hi, everyone.
[02:24:00.705 --> 02:24:01.566]  Andy Anderson here.
[02:24:01.766 --> 02:24:06.029]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[02:24:06.170 --> 02:24:11.835]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[02:24:11.975 --> 02:24:16.218]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, good-bye effectiveness?
[02:24:16.318 --> 02:24:18.020]  No more protection till you use it again.
[02:24:18.160 --> 02:24:19.340]  PureWorks to the rescue!
[02:24:19.501 --> 02:24:23.862]  Our FDA-compliant foam, lotion, soap and spray do not contain alcohol.
[02:24:23.902 --> 02:24:25.963]  Their killing power lasts up to four hours.
[02:24:26.103 --> 02:24:39.147]  PureWorks disinfecting spray is EPA-certified to kill swine flu, bird flu, MRSA, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and for our friends in medicine, kills C. diff, along with a whole host of viruses and bacteria, molds and fungus too.
[02:24:39.167 --> 02:24:40.708]  It's even safe around pets and children.
[02:24:40.808 --> 02:24:43.889]  You'll love how your skin feels with PureWorks Soft and Supple.
[02:24:43.989 --> 02:24:45.009]  No more dry skin.
[02:24:45.149 --> 02:24:49.610]  Here's to a little peace of mind knowing that your hands are still germ-free hours later.
[02:24:49.750 --> 02:24:56.811]  Call now toll-free 888-245-0300 to get your hands on PureWorks and get PureWorks on your hands.
[02:24:56.931 --> 02:24:57.211]  That's 888-245-0300.
[02:25:11.710 --> 02:25:14.011]  It's like the head of the IMF, the head of the World Bank.
[02:25:14.031 --> 02:25:16.633]  They've all come out and they've said, the good times are over.
[02:25:16.653 --> 02:25:17.234]  That's a quote.
[02:25:17.474 --> 02:25:18.394]  You're going to be poor now.
[02:25:18.414 --> 02:25:20.235]  And they have all these other publications.
[02:25:20.255 --> 02:25:24.598]  I remember 10 years ago hearing NPR brag, we're going to have our economy fall apart.
[02:25:24.638 --> 02:25:25.499]  It's unsustainable.
[02:25:25.539 --> 02:25:26.579]  This is going to be good for the earth.
[02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:28.701]  No, it's good for them to control us.
[02:25:29.694 --> 02:25:32.075]  And they've hijacked the environmental movement.
[02:25:32.395 --> 02:25:33.155]  They control it.
[02:25:33.175 --> 02:25:35.075]  They have a lot of well-meaning people working for them.
[02:25:35.375 --> 02:25:36.496]  But I was talking to George Humphrey.
[02:25:36.516 --> 02:25:40.277]  I was saying, George, you know, for many years you did your TV show here in Austin, for more than a decade.
[02:25:41.737 --> 02:25:42.837]  You don't do it very often anymore.
[02:25:42.857 --> 02:25:48.419]  I said, why don't you just turn a YouTube camera on at your house once a week or when you're in town and upload stuff.
[02:25:48.439 --> 02:25:54.540]  And I was explaining to him how we have eight different YouTube channels that we've been uploading to for two years.
[02:25:54.580 --> 02:25:57.101]  I mean, we've had our stuff on YouTube since 2005 when it came out.
[02:25:58.661 --> 02:26:02.445]  But it's now more than half of the video on the web.
[02:26:03.066 --> 02:26:04.107]  So that's the battleground.
[02:26:04.367 --> 02:26:12.716]  Yeah, there's censorship, there's problems, but we go there because when we put it on YouTube, it then gets duplicated to thousands of other video sites and then reaches people.
[02:26:12.756 --> 02:26:15.319]  But our eight channels, over 110 million views.
[02:26:15.339 --> 02:26:16.581]  There are 44 million views.
[02:26:19.944 --> 02:26:22.725]  Just on one channel, and that's one small part.
[02:26:22.745 --> 02:26:26.346]  We're now over 80 AM and FM affiliates, not 65, we've grown.
[02:26:27.086 --> 02:26:32.848]  We're now on Shortwave, Satellite, XM, the podcast, over 250,000 people downloaded today.
[02:26:33.148 --> 02:26:37.890]  We started an iPhone app that's free at Infowars.com, 40 plus thousand have downloaded that in the last three months.
[02:26:38.130 --> 02:26:42.311]  I mean, we have all these different ways, my films, the DVDs, people buy them, they make copies.
[02:26:42.671 --> 02:26:49.774]  Well, a new documentary that we're carrying that we're going to have first and start shipping out late next week is Don't Tread on Me About States' Rights.
[02:26:49.794 --> 02:26:51.394]  That's available at InfoWars.com.
[02:26:51.694 --> 02:26:55.756]  But the point is, you watch something I did 10 years ago, or you did 10 years ago, it's evergreen.
[02:26:56.056 --> 02:26:56.616]  It's pertinent.
[02:26:56.636 --> 02:26:58.597]  People see things we did 12 years ago.
[02:26:58.657 --> 02:26:59.557]  It's pertinent today.
[02:26:59.597 --> 02:27:00.317]  It's evergreen.
[02:27:00.617 --> 02:27:02.598]  The globalists, it's lies and distortions.
[02:27:02.618 --> 02:27:04.919]  They've got to keep reapplying, reapplying, reapplying.
[02:27:05.419 --> 02:27:09.442]  And so all this work we've done, that's just on my channels, 110 million views.
[02:27:09.802 --> 02:27:19.849]  Not counting all the other channels, you know, with 6 million here for Obama deception, 2 million there for Obama deception, 500,000 for Endgame, 300,000 for Endgame, a million for Endgame.
[02:27:20.149 --> 02:27:25.092]  You know, just on YouTube, it's conservatively 200 million people
[02:27:29.213 --> 02:27:32.275]  And, you know, to have Nightline here, and they were fully aware of that.
[02:27:32.295 --> 02:27:33.156]  That's what they were here about.
[02:27:33.176 --> 02:27:44.543]  They wanted to understand this, and that's why Obama and the UN and the New York Times and all these corporations, Art, Cass Sunstein, who's a big supporter of the new Supreme Court Justice nominee, Kagan, they've all called
[02:27:45.163 --> 02:27:58.109]  In fact, when they had the La Raza extremists out at UCLA saying, we're going to get the old white people, we're taking over, we're going to get you, you know, government funded to do this, to divide people, they had a sign behind them saying, hate speech is not free speech.
[02:27:58.389 --> 02:28:04.752]  So there they are spewing true hate, but I defend their First Amendment, until they call for sedition, which they were really doing, which is firing a theater.
[02:28:05.572 --> 02:28:11.935]  There they were, but then saying, my speech has to be taken, my guns have to be taken so they can carry out their system.
[02:28:12.215 --> 02:28:14.456]  And so they're really going to try this.
[02:28:15.037 --> 02:28:17.498]  I mean, they're really going for broke here.
[02:28:17.978 --> 02:28:25.382]  Before we go back to calls, George Humphrey, your take on the rollout, the trial balloons for Internet censorship and control.
[02:28:25.642 --> 02:28:27.263]  Well, I was just reading yesterday that
[02:28:28.884 --> 02:28:34.788]  Our wonderful new president, the man of change, is another one of his flip-flops.
[02:28:35.168 --> 02:28:49.920]  When he was on the campaign trail, he promised that he would protect the privacy and the freedom of the internet, and now his lawyers are pushing restrictions that are far greater than President George W. Bush ever thought about.
[02:28:50.560 --> 02:29:03.218]  Folks, if you have any of your dear friends who still believe that Barry Sotero is there for the people of this country, please take them out to lunch and just give them the objective information.
[02:29:03.859 --> 02:29:05.982]  This fellow is an incredible puppet.
[02:29:06.042 --> 02:29:06.503]  He's as
[02:29:08.035 --> 02:29:10.255]  You know, we know he is the tip of the spear.
[02:29:10.635 --> 02:29:12.116]  He is an incredible choice.
[02:29:12.156 --> 02:29:23.538]  Yeah, he's very good-looking, he's very articulate in front of the monitors, but he is a puppet of the New World Order, and he's very, very dangerous because he is so good.
[02:29:24.158 --> 02:29:31.139]  And he is not there for your rights, and he is working diligently to try and restrict the Internet.
[02:29:31.259 --> 02:29:33.739]  And the Internet is our friend.
[02:29:33.759 --> 02:29:36.380]  And they're going to try to take it down with a false cyber attack.
[02:29:36.980 --> 02:29:39.061]  It's like they create the financial terrorism.
[02:29:39.141 --> 02:29:40.462]  They stage the terror attacks.
[02:29:40.763 --> 02:29:54.652]  They're saying, oh, the cyber attack's coming and we have to be able to shut the web off and restrict freedom and control all ISPs and decide who can be on the web and we have an internet too that's kindler and gentler to stop Al-Qaeda attacking our internet, George.
[02:29:55.212 --> 02:29:59.635]  Meanwhile, Obama's in all these speeches bemoaning how he's being discredited by the internet.
[02:29:59.735 --> 02:30:05.038]  Yeah, and just FYI, instead of using Google, use StartPage.com.
[02:30:05.158 --> 02:30:07.239]  They don't record your searches.
[02:30:07.699 --> 02:30:11.240]  It's a step in the right direction, and I think that they're one of your sponsors, aren't they?
[02:30:11.260 --> 02:30:14.882]  No, no, they're great folks, and I really support StartPage.com.
[02:30:15.582 --> 02:30:22.446]  It's just that when I'm on a radio show or something, I have to say, let's say I'm on some talk show and I've got like a minute and a half.
[02:30:23.536 --> 02:30:30.378]  I have to say, go to search engines, like startpage.com, but if I just say Google, people know.
[02:30:30.958 --> 02:30:40.722]  And the problem is, I've gotten so Google obsessed, where I know how to search Google, that with some other search engines, if I give out a certain headline, it may not get what I'm looking for.
[02:30:40.942 --> 02:30:41.442]  Exactly.
[02:30:41.782 --> 02:30:44.243]  But I think it's important to use proxy servers.
[02:30:45.083 --> 02:30:48.464]  And other systems, when you go to Google, and I think Startpage is excellent as well.
[02:30:48.504 --> 02:30:51.025]  And I've gone over to Startpage in my own research.
[02:30:51.385 --> 02:31:05.611]  And for all of you, I certainly encourage all of you to have a group of friends, email friends, around the country that once a week or twice a week or once a day you send them information about the economy, about politics,
[02:31:06.371 --> 02:31:09.133]  Yeah, don't just receive this information.
[02:31:09.153 --> 02:31:10.774]  I know most of you already know this.
[02:31:11.895 --> 02:31:12.575]  Use it.
[02:31:12.635 --> 02:31:13.916]  Because it's hurting the globalists.
[02:31:14.136 --> 02:31:15.497]  That's why they're calling for restricting it.
[02:31:15.517 --> 02:31:16.778]  Be a magnifier.
[02:31:16.938 --> 02:31:18.118]  Be the clear light.
[02:31:18.259 --> 02:31:20.520]  Be the Paul Reveres.
[02:31:20.600 --> 02:31:21.801]  Because I'll tell you what.
[02:31:22.802 --> 02:31:27.264]  A few of us, as we grow and grow and grow, we are sending out information.
[02:31:27.644 --> 02:31:34.727]  And the information that I received just four or five years ago is just minuscule in comparison to what I receive every week.
[02:31:34.787 --> 02:31:35.487]  It's exponential.
[02:31:35.567 --> 02:31:37.008]  It's unbelievable what I'm getting.
[02:31:37.088 --> 02:31:39.049]  And the quality of info is getting better.
[02:31:39.069 --> 02:31:41.250]  You know, the globalists have their disinfo agents.
[02:31:41.670 --> 02:31:53.201]  You know, it's not just radical Hispanic groups, funded by the Ford Foundation and the CIA on record, that are trying to go out and say, you're an Uncle Tom to Hispanics that are, you know, free market, pro-Second Amendment, pro-America.
[02:31:53.841 --> 02:31:59.246]  I've had the white supremacist, like Hal Turner, who's now been proven to be a Fed in major newspapers, he admits he's...
[02:32:00.027 --> 02:32:00.488]  We're good.
[02:32:15.849 --> 02:32:27.056]  Is just like we've had the Republicans come in with the Tea Party Express and try to take over the Tea Party, so now it's not a Ron Paul libertarian type thing, it's a Republican thing, but that's not working as well.
[02:32:27.336 --> 02:32:39.804]  So just like I've had white supremacists try to intimidate me over the last 15 years to, you know, you're white, you better join us or you're scum, the Hispanics can't give into that either, and Tea Party people can't go under the Republican Party's control.
[02:32:40.244 --> 02:32:41.665]  All of this is about co-opting.
[02:32:42.285 --> 02:32:42.885]  Absolutely.
[02:32:42.986 --> 02:32:49.490]  And the fact remains, is very, very clear, is that we're all in this together.
[02:32:49.630 --> 02:32:52.031]  It's not just white Americans.
[02:32:52.272 --> 02:32:55.534]  It's not just, it's not just male Americans.
[02:32:55.594 --> 02:32:56.715]  It's not just Americans.
[02:32:56.795 --> 02:32:58.736]  It's all the people of this planet.
[02:32:58.836 --> 02:33:01.838]  And we have a choice between fear and love.
[02:33:01.898 --> 02:33:04.520]  We have a choice between materialism and domination.
[02:33:05.220 --> 02:33:09.683]  Or an economy in a world in which we cooperate and we take care.
[02:33:10.203 --> 02:33:11.524]  And right now is the choice.
[02:33:11.644 --> 02:33:12.545]  Every single one of you.
[02:33:12.785 --> 02:33:14.466]  Every single one of you have a choice.
[02:33:15.006 --> 02:33:20.609]  And by sitting out, by not doing anything, and just by listening to the show, I know you've already cast your vote.
[02:33:21.410 --> 02:33:26.033]  And one person, as Mahatma Gandhi said, can change the whole world.
[02:33:26.413 --> 02:33:29.755]  Trust yourself by telling the truth and having courage.
[02:33:29.875 --> 02:33:30.895]  Well, I think that's the key.
[02:33:31.356 --> 02:33:33.536]  Courage doesn't mean you have to charge a machine gun nest.
[02:33:33.556 --> 02:33:47.081]  It means you've got to stand up at a dinner party with authority and say, hey, I know we're all having a good time here talking about stocks and bonds and basketball scores or golf, but you need to know this is going on and I care about everybody here, so I'm going to speak for a few minutes.
[02:33:47.601 --> 02:33:51.003]  Because as Americans, as free people, we're supposed to talk about real issues.
[02:33:51.543 --> 02:33:54.264]  I mean, I'll be in a convenience store and say, look at this.
[02:33:54.944 --> 02:33:58.508]  None of this candy has regular sugar.
[02:33:58.768 --> 02:33:59.829]  It's all aspartame.
[02:34:00.089 --> 02:34:01.530]  Did you know that's a chemical weapon?
[02:34:01.791 --> 02:34:04.673]  Did you know it's the byproduct of a genetically engineered bacteria?
[02:34:05.034 --> 02:34:12.501]  Go home and search engine the term aspartame manufacturing process or aspartame cancer.
[02:34:13.362 --> 02:34:16.665]  And people will be looking at me weird and I go, it's normal for me to warn you.
[02:34:17.065 --> 02:34:20.227]  We're supposed to communicate, not just stuff you see on TV.
[02:34:20.527 --> 02:34:21.908]  You're meant to talk to your neighbors.
[02:34:22.229 --> 02:34:33.797]  And so I'll start preaching even louder, and I do that in front of my kids when they're with me at the grocery store or at a convenience store after we go on a hike and we pull in and they want some water and they want some bubblegum and I can't buy it.
[02:34:33.837 --> 02:34:36.038]  I go, I'm sorry, this has chemical weapons in it.
[02:34:36.398 --> 02:34:37.859]  And they go, oh, that's right, Daddy.
[02:34:38.079 --> 02:34:42.062]  And then some guy starts laughing and my son turns and says, I guess he's brainwashed.
[02:34:43.866 --> 02:34:45.167]  I love you Alex.
[02:34:45.607 --> 02:34:46.548]  I do the same thing.
[02:34:46.688 --> 02:34:47.629]  I play a lot of golf.
[02:34:47.689 --> 02:35:00.618]  I go out to the driving range and you know about once every three times I'm at the driving range the white jets go over and are laying down the chemtrails and there'll be 20 people at the driving range and nobody, they're outside and
[02:35:01.659 --> 02:35:04.860]  Ninety-nine percent of the people never look up in the air.
[02:35:05.480 --> 02:35:08.320]  And I'll just go, hey, friends, take a look up there.
[02:35:08.380 --> 02:35:09.621]  What is that up there?
[02:35:10.061 --> 02:35:10.701]  What is that?
[02:35:10.781 --> 02:35:12.841]  That's not a contrail.
[02:35:13.141 --> 02:35:14.621]  And I'll get people talking.
[02:35:14.662 --> 02:35:24.703]  And the amazing thing is, eyes wide shut, our suppressors, our slave masters, have done such an incredible job.
[02:35:25.023 --> 02:35:27.224]  They are carrying out their crime.
[02:35:28.144 --> 02:35:30.046]  Right in front of our eyes.
[02:35:30.547 --> 02:35:31.247]  But you know what?
[02:35:31.287 --> 02:35:34.250]  There are people that have their eyes wide open.
[02:35:34.611 --> 02:35:35.832]  And more and more people.
[02:35:36.032 --> 02:35:38.695]  And you can just point to people and say, what is that up there?
[02:35:38.755 --> 02:35:39.215]  What is that?
[02:35:39.235 --> 02:35:40.356]  That is not a contrail.
[02:35:40.596 --> 02:35:42.578]  And then explain to them what a chemtrail is.
[02:35:42.598 --> 02:35:42.819]  All right.
[02:35:43.119 --> 02:35:45.121]  And I want to go over this briefly and then go to calls.
[02:35:45.641 --> 02:35:47.823]  Not just about chemtrails, but a microcosm.
[02:35:49.263 --> 02:36:02.552]  In 1992, a scientist, and we're making a film on this, got a Nobel Prize for a plan to stop global warming, which we know is a fraud, that's just their cover story, to spray barium salts and aluminum dioxide in the atmosphere.
[02:36:03.093 --> 02:36:08.216]  Now suddenly in the last five years, high school textbooks say the government is spraying, this is normal.
[02:36:08.476 --> 02:36:10.598]  So for the kids, they're just being conditioned.
[02:36:10.638 --> 02:36:12.219]  For adults, we're told it doesn't exist.
[02:36:12.679 --> 02:36:18.103]  Then the White House science czar who wrote EcoScience, his first speech, you can pull this up on YouTube,
[02:36:18.883 --> 02:36:21.586]  John P. Holdren talks about geoengineering.
[02:36:22.086 --> 02:36:26.631]  And he'll say, we've been doing tests since the early 90s of spraying the atmosphere.
[02:36:26.651 --> 02:36:28.072]  Now we're going operational.
[02:36:28.412 --> 02:36:30.915]  But there's never a discussion about the funding or who's doing it.
[02:36:30.955 --> 02:36:34.638]  So what's happened is, because we've exposed the chemtrails of the aerosol crimes.
[02:36:35.259 --> 02:36:50.609]  They come right out in plain view and calmly say, yes we're spraying you, move along, just like they came out on Fox News, AP, Reuters in the last month, New York Times, and said, we are helping grow the opium, we have to or Al-Qaeda will make the money.
[02:36:51.089 --> 02:36:53.371]  And they'll take over 500 billion a year.
[02:36:53.471 --> 02:37:02.097]  No discussion of where are you shipping it, why don't you just legalize it and then that would drive down the price and Al-Qaeda wouldn't get the money, or, well what do you mean Al-Qaeda will get the money?
[02:37:02.677 --> 02:37:05.098]  Again, they just, oh, we are growing the opium now.
[02:37:05.618 --> 02:37:07.099]  Oh, we are spraying you now.
[02:37:07.559 --> 02:37:10.940]  Oh, we are looking at putting things in your water to sterilize you.
[02:37:10.960 --> 02:37:11.680]  They're already doing it.
[02:37:12.020 --> 02:37:18.522]  So it's that same thing of, it isn't just in their religious or sadomasochistic psycho world they do this.
[02:37:18.843 --> 02:37:23.064]  There's a method to it where they just calmly tell you, like it loses the power.
[02:37:23.584 --> 02:37:24.545]  Yeah, we're spraying you.
[02:37:25.065 --> 02:37:27.145]  Yeah, there's some cancer viruses in there.
[02:37:27.165 --> 02:37:28.566]  Yeah, I was all hype about the flu.
[02:37:28.986 --> 02:37:31.387]  Yeah, we're growing the drugs, yeah.
[02:37:32.708 --> 02:37:33.369]  It's amazing!
[02:37:33.609 --> 02:37:35.190]  It's right in front of our eyes!
[02:37:35.570 --> 02:37:39.433]  And again, as I said before, what an incredible time to be alive!
[02:37:39.733 --> 02:37:47.178]  And I am so thankful that I am here, right in the epicenter of the Truth Center, standing next to my friend, Alex, right here.
[02:37:47.238 --> 02:37:48.078]  Because you know what?
[02:37:48.439 --> 02:38:02.368]  Telling the truth, standing up for freedom, having love in your heart, making new friends, working for freedom, working for the ideals of the Republic, cleaning up our economy and our environment.
[02:38:03.429 --> 02:38:05.430]  What more fun things are there to do?
[02:38:05.470 --> 02:38:06.671]  And we're only alive once.
[02:38:06.711 --> 02:38:13.375]  This is a great time of change and we're going to decide the destiny of this planet and then its journey to the stars.
[02:38:13.415 --> 02:38:14.296]  Let's go to phone calls.
[02:38:14.336 --> 02:38:17.378]  Well said, George Humphrey, economist, joining us here in studio.
[02:38:17.558 --> 02:38:18.719]  Author, filmmaker as well.
[02:38:18.999 --> 02:38:19.840]  Again, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:38:19.880 --> 02:38:25.463]  We just joined us as we attempt to wake the planet up to defeat the New World Order, the social engineers.
[02:38:26.144 --> 02:38:27.825]  Let's talk to Frank in Nevada.
[02:38:27.845 --> 02:38:28.365]  You're on the air.
[02:38:28.405 --> 02:38:28.986]  Thanks for holding.
[02:38:30.071 --> 02:38:31.252]  Hey, how you doing, guys?
[02:38:31.392 --> 02:38:32.493]  Just a terrific show.
[02:38:32.513 --> 02:38:34.114]  I'm loving listening to you today.
[02:38:34.995 --> 02:38:36.416]  You know, you've got to remember one thing.
[02:38:36.476 --> 02:38:43.201]  In ritual magic, one of the things that they like to do is they like to create out of nothing.
[02:38:43.241 --> 02:38:49.945]  In other words, when they create a work of art that formants their concept, like the films a couple of years ago.
[02:38:49.985 --> 02:38:51.547]  Yeah, no, that's the lesser magic.
[02:38:51.587 --> 02:38:55.549]  That's preparing the sword, you know, the rough sword before they polish it.
[02:38:56.410 --> 02:38:56.970]  Exactly.
[02:38:56.990 --> 02:38:59.052]  The thing we have to remember is we cannot
[02:39:00.151 --> 02:39:00.351]  I don't
[02:39:19.744 --> 02:39:20.725]  Well, well, well said, my friend.
[02:39:37.985 --> 02:39:39.987]  And I think it's that separation from them.
[02:39:40.007 --> 02:39:41.608]  You know, they're in their evil.
[02:39:41.868 --> 02:39:47.433]  We have to be part of the good and the love and we need to make the clean break and point out and even declare it.
[02:39:48.734 --> 02:39:49.955]  Saying something's powerful.
[02:39:50.375 --> 02:39:51.236]  I am not with you.
[02:39:51.256 --> 02:39:52.997]  I'm going to stand against you.
[02:39:53.338 --> 02:39:55.920]  I'm going against you and we're going to beat you.
[02:39:56.620 --> 02:40:12.141]  I think it's very important to declare it and to really consciously realize this so people who serve this system who are compartmentalized and who aren't consciously part of the evil, you need to assess what you're in and understand that if you're aiding and abetting this system,
[02:40:13.062 --> 02:40:14.562]  You're part of the problem.
[02:40:14.622 --> 02:40:23.525]  Yeah, and it's like in the Matrix, in the movie The Matrix, if you weren't down as a human being in Zion, you were part of the Matrix.
[02:40:23.605 --> 02:40:28.346]  No matter how good-looking you were or how rich you were, you were part of the problem.
[02:40:28.786 --> 02:40:31.626]  And there are some basic laws of the universe.
[02:40:31.887 --> 02:40:33.407]  The law of intention.
[02:40:33.747 --> 02:40:35.407]  We have to set our intention.
[02:40:35.707 --> 02:40:36.628]  Are we for freedom?
[02:40:36.728 --> 02:40:37.868]  Are we for the Republic?
[02:40:37.948 --> 02:40:39.248]  Are we for sustainability?
[02:40:39.308 --> 02:40:40.108]  Are we for love?
[02:40:40.469 --> 02:40:42.449]  Or are we for this control matrix?
[02:40:42.449 --> 02:40:43.930]  And remember, they always have counterfeits.
[02:40:43.970 --> 02:40:47.451]  You say love and sustainability and working together through free will.
[02:40:47.712 --> 02:40:49.592]  They come with slavery for the collective.
[02:40:49.632 --> 02:40:49.973]  Absolutely.
[02:40:49.993 --> 02:40:51.073]  They always have a counterfeit.
[02:40:51.113 --> 02:40:54.235]  And we always have to be very articulate in what we say.
[02:40:54.495 --> 02:41:09.322]  And then, just like the fellow said, through the purity of our heart, only through the law of attraction, and we can have all the great words in the world and we can rant and rave, but if we're not paying, if we're not taking care of our families, if we're trashing things ourselves,
[02:41:09.682 --> 02:41:12.904]  And if we aren't living a good life, all the words in the world are zero.
[02:41:27.512 --> 02:41:28.413]  It's almost electric.
[02:41:28.453 --> 02:41:29.714]  People can tell the truth.
[02:41:29.754 --> 02:41:30.874]  It's like, I'm warning you.
[02:41:30.894 --> 02:41:35.116]  You know, I'm not... So many yuppies, when you tell them about something, they think you're showing off.
[02:41:35.657 --> 02:41:38.118]  Or they'll say, I don't care if the market went down, I'm not in it.
[02:41:38.538 --> 02:41:42.000]  As if, as if, you know, they're separated from things.
[02:41:42.120 --> 02:41:45.882]  Yeah, and that's why discernment is so essential at this time.
[02:41:46.322 --> 02:41:54.507]  There are a lot of souls on this planet who have chosen to go down the path of materialism and of fear.
[02:41:55.450 --> 02:42:01.356]  And you're just not going to be able to deal, just like you can't deal with certain alcoholics or people who are irrational.
[02:42:01.637 --> 02:42:11.307]  You can love them and you can try and help them, but we've got to take care of ourselves, our friends and our family and have that pure intention to make... Charity starts at home.
[02:42:11.527 --> 02:42:12.088]  Absolutely.
[02:42:12.108 --> 02:42:14.490]  I mean you've got to get your house in order and that doesn't...
[02:42:15.011 --> 02:42:16.532]  At the same time, it's sophisticated.
[02:42:17.133 --> 02:42:18.894]  A lot of people go to the extreme of that.
[02:42:19.174 --> 02:42:20.255]  And I appreciate your call, Frank.
[02:42:20.295 --> 02:42:20.776]  Great points.
[02:42:21.176 --> 02:42:23.438]  They go to the extreme and they say, well, I'm not perfect.
[02:42:23.558 --> 02:42:24.759]  I don't have all the answers.
[02:42:25.219 --> 02:42:27.461]  So I better just never speak out or get involved.
[02:42:27.501 --> 02:42:28.042]  No, no, no, no.
[02:42:28.302 --> 02:42:30.704]  It just means you're going in the right direction.
[02:42:30.764 --> 02:42:32.606]  You've made a decision to try to be good.
[02:42:32.966 --> 02:42:37.530]  A decision to open yourself up to goodness and to set yourself against evil.
[02:42:38.110 --> 02:42:38.691]  Absolutely.
[02:42:39.111 --> 02:42:40.452]  You don't have to be perfect.
[02:42:41.033 --> 02:42:46.277]  This is part of a great game, and working for freedom, working for peace is part of the game.
[02:42:46.557 --> 02:42:47.438]  It's a great game.
[02:42:47.778 --> 02:42:48.639]  And it's a progression.
[02:42:48.679 --> 02:42:51.521]  You'll get better and better at this, you know, the further you go.
[02:42:52.122 --> 02:42:54.744]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, jamming a few final calls.
[02:42:55.645 --> 02:42:57.366]  Justin, Chris, Adam, and others.
[02:42:57.406 --> 02:42:58.267]  George Humphries, our guest.
[02:43:00.829 --> 02:43:04.152]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoods Direct was
[02:43:07.642 --> 02:43:08.483]  Quick Fix Meals!
[02:43:31.869 --> 02:43:32.169]  I think so.
[02:44:02.859 --> 02:44:04.821]  And you're subject to other police action.
[02:44:05.321 --> 02:44:06.262]  Tyranny is here.
[02:44:06.582 --> 02:44:10.304]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:44:10.464 --> 02:44:12.726]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:44:12.746 --> 02:44:18.170]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:44:18.615 --> 02:44:24.879]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:44:25.279 --> 02:44:30.842]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:44:31.263 --> 02:44:34.925]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:44:35.445 --> 02:44:39.427]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:44:39.727 --> 02:44:45.230]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:44:45.670 --> 02:44:48.672]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:44:49.232 --> 02:44:50.633]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:44:51.193 --> 02:44:51.713]  It's here.

[02:45:41.693 --> 02:45:45.135]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.

[02:46:06.411 --> 02:46:08.952]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[02:46:08.992 --> 02:46:11.333]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[02:46:11.393 --> 02:46:14.355]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[02:46:14.435 --> 02:46:19.237]  And everybody knew you didn't give no lip to Big John.
[02:46:19.817 --> 02:46:20.817]  Big John!
[02:46:27.147 --> 02:46:28.988]  You know, I wish that we had more time.
[02:46:29.028 --> 02:46:30.669]  The show is basically over.
[02:46:30.689 --> 02:46:31.869]  The broadcast is over.
[02:46:31.889 --> 02:46:34.170]  We're going to try to take a few final phone calls.
[02:46:34.810 --> 02:46:37.011]  We've created a mirror over at GCNlive.com
[02:46:38.371 --> 02:46:40.473]  We post a lot of our news over there exclusively now.
[02:46:41.113 --> 02:46:53.082]  I saw an amazing video from We Are Change Ireland shouting down David Rockefeller saying your new order will never succeed, then getting into the restaurant where he is at a globalist meeting, engineering this for the Trilateral Commission, and getting in his face.
[02:46:53.463 --> 02:46:55.724]  That video is up at GCNlive.com.
[02:46:55.744 --> 02:46:58.587]  David Rockefeller confronted at his dinner table by the sovereign.
[02:46:59.768 --> 02:47:01.969]  Independence, the name of the group at the Trilateral Commission.
[02:47:02.810 --> 02:47:04.871]  I mean, you talk about incredible.
[02:47:04.891 --> 02:47:07.793]  They went in the Trilateral Commission and confronted him.
[02:47:08.874 --> 02:47:13.978]  When they yelled at him, David Rockefeller, you'll never get your New World Order, he turned around and he was not arrogant.
[02:47:14.018 --> 02:47:15.179]  They said, you're not going to make it.
[02:47:15.199 --> 02:47:16.640]  You're not going to live long enough to do it.
[02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:19.482]  And he was just like the emperor, just like, oh.
[02:47:19.842 --> 02:47:21.023]  I meant to get to that today.
[02:47:21.083 --> 02:47:21.724]  Just incredible.
[02:47:22.204 --> 02:47:23.345]  Remind me to play that tomorrow.
[02:47:23.365 --> 02:47:24.746]  Let me just break in there.
[02:47:24.986 --> 02:47:27.968]  I saw Karl Rove the other day at our coffee shop.
[02:47:28.909 --> 02:47:37.854]  And it was just so, he was getting out to his car, so I couldn't talk to him, but I just looked him in the eye, and I just looked at him and smiled and went, turned my thumb down.
[02:47:37.874 --> 02:47:39.835]  The guy is evil.
[02:47:40.116 --> 02:47:42.217]  And you know, bless his soul, the guy is evil.
[02:47:42.837 --> 02:47:43.778]  And you know what?
[02:47:43.878 --> 02:47:55.905]  When you see these Karl Rose, when you see the David Rockefellers, or even your local city council member who's sold out to the Chamber of Commerce for the big business, go and look him in the eye and talk to him.
[02:47:56.165 --> 02:47:57.085]  Why are you doing that?
[02:47:57.185 --> 02:47:57.906]  Confront them.
[02:47:58.326 --> 02:48:01.827]  Not with anger, but look in the eye and be very, very clear.
[02:48:01.867 --> 02:48:03.247]  No, very stern, steely.
[02:48:03.267 --> 02:48:03.527]  Yes.
[02:48:03.687 --> 02:48:06.848]  Look, I don't like what you're doing, it's wrong, and I see you.
[02:48:07.288 --> 02:48:09.109]  I think it's important to say, I see you.
[02:48:09.129 --> 02:48:11.629]  It means I look into you, I know what you are.
[02:48:11.769 --> 02:48:16.270]  Yes, and why are you doing this, and what is your relationship to God?
[02:48:16.370 --> 02:48:21.011]  Why are you selling out the people of Austin, or Sacramento, or Boston?
[02:48:21.031 --> 02:48:22.512]  Well, what about your family line?
[02:48:22.552 --> 02:48:24.252]  This is going to come back on their grandchildren.
[02:48:24.392 --> 02:48:24.993]  Absolutely.
[02:48:25.253 --> 02:48:33.160]  You know, when I grew up, a man's highest value was the value of his word and his service to his community.
[02:48:34.221 --> 02:48:41.307]  Now that doesn't mean a thing, but in a real society, a person's integrity is their most valuable asset.
[02:48:42.028 --> 02:48:48.713]  And all of these clowns, whether they're the county commissioners or the city councilmen or the U.S.
[02:48:48.754 --> 02:48:49.955]  congressmen, they are
[02:48:52.337 --> 02:48:56.281]  98% bought and paid for by the... And most of them are just unconscious.
[02:48:56.341 --> 02:48:57.842]  They say, how do I go up that ladder?
[02:48:58.082 --> 02:48:59.003]  I do whatever I'm told?
[02:48:59.183 --> 02:48:59.584]  Okay.
[02:48:59.884 --> 02:49:03.007]  I mean, they're not even thinking about selling out.
[02:49:03.567 --> 02:49:05.128]  Selling out is what it is.
[02:49:05.269 --> 02:49:05.489]  Yes.
[02:49:05.849 --> 02:49:06.029]  Yeah.
[02:49:06.329 --> 02:49:09.152]  And that's why the globalists are moving on us so hard.
[02:49:09.192 --> 02:49:12.114]  I mean, people say, God, you know, Alex, how come you haven't sold out?
[02:49:12.154 --> 02:49:14.537]  And I've been, I mean, I've been given bonafide offers.
[02:49:15.576 --> 02:49:17.158]  Sell out?
[02:49:17.258 --> 02:49:19.940]  Sell out to a group that's poisoning my water supply?
[02:49:20.441 --> 02:49:23.804]  Sell out to a group that... I mean, sell out to jumping off a cliff?
[02:49:24.304 --> 02:49:26.466]  I mean, there is no selling out to evil.
[02:49:26.726 --> 02:49:27.747]  That's a mind game.
[02:49:27.807 --> 02:49:30.370]  You cannot win selling out to this.
[02:49:31.757 --> 02:49:34.339]  There is no winning, and that's the mind game, George.
[02:49:34.639 --> 02:49:35.099]  Absolutely.
[02:49:35.140 --> 02:49:50.670]  For example, in Hitler's Germany in 1930s, the gays were offered all these nice new uniforms to be in the SS, and they were told that they were going to have safety, and then they came in and did the dirty work, and a couple years later, then they were put in jail.
[02:49:50.710 --> 02:49:54.332]  Night of the Long Knives, they killed, what was it, 50-something thousand gays in one night?
[02:49:54.372 --> 02:49:55.913]  The Nazi Party was a gay movement.
[02:49:56.434 --> 02:49:58.495]  It was a gay movement, and then they turned on them.
[02:49:58.915 --> 02:50:01.357]  You can't, if you sell out, you sell out yourself.
[02:50:01.998 --> 02:50:02.579]  Absolutely.
[02:50:02.599 --> 02:50:04.561]  And by the way, that's not even attacking gay people.
[02:50:04.582 --> 02:50:05.603]  That's a historical fact.
[02:50:05.683 --> 02:50:06.324]  Ernst Rohm.
[02:50:06.684 --> 02:50:07.225]  It's a fact.
[02:50:07.265 --> 02:50:07.846]  Go look it up.
[02:50:07.946 --> 02:50:09.709]  I've read more than a hundred books.
[02:50:10.249 --> 02:50:11.191]  Order of the Deathshead.
[02:50:11.211 --> 02:50:15.337]  I mean, we're talking about Scherer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.
[02:50:15.357 --> 02:50:16.638]  I mean, these are Pulitzer Prize winners.
[02:50:16.678 --> 02:50:17.700]  This is not...
[02:50:18.601 --> 02:50:21.204]  But we're out of time, and I apologize to the last callers.
[02:50:21.544 --> 02:50:22.405]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:50:22.485 --> 02:50:23.265]  I'll get you on.
[02:50:23.906 --> 02:50:24.807]  Great job to the crew.
[02:50:24.887 --> 02:50:28.891]  Again, bankers are destroying the global economy by design to consolidate power.
