[00:00:05.651 --> 00:00:06.291]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.972 --> 00:00:07.993]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:09.855]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.495 --> 00:00:11.316]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.097 --> 00:00:13.037]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:17.261]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.822 --> 00:00:21.885]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.932 --> 00:00:24.033]  What's the Bible say?
[00:00:24.073 --> 00:00:27.695]  You are neither hot nor cold, so I spit you out of my mouth.
[00:00:27.915 --> 00:00:30.776]  And I look at the jellyfish that the New World Order has created.
[00:00:31.277 --> 00:00:34.539]  Once human, now just mindless drones that respond to television.
[00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:37.860]  And they are lukewarm jellyfish.
[00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:40.702]  Like leaves that blow where the wind takes them.
[00:00:41.202 --> 00:00:41.663]  Not me!
[00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:43.123]  Not me.
[00:00:43.463 --> 00:00:55.727]  It is such a simple, fundamental shift, ladies and gentlemen, towards liberty, and towards humanity, and towards the animating spirit of our Savior that has created this universe, and you will be free.
[00:00:56.107 --> 00:00:58.108]  Free of the fear, free of the weakness.
[00:00:58.968 --> 00:01:08.471]  The New World Order entices you, it makes you feel weak, it makes you feel incompetent, it tells you it can sell you the answers when it sells you death.
[00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:11.340]  All right, I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.703]  Chris, May, Dave, Ted, others.
[00:01:15.583 --> 00:01:17.045]  Chris in Wisconsin, you're on the air.
[00:01:17.065 --> 00:01:17.665]  Thanks for holding.
[00:01:18.586 --> 00:01:19.427]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[00:01:19.747 --> 00:01:21.729]  My name's Chris.
[00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.731]  I'm 32, and I've been waking up since I was 16.
[00:01:24.831 --> 00:01:27.854]  So we've been on a similar path for a similar amount of time.
[00:01:27.894 --> 00:01:30.376]  And in that time, I wish I could have found a way to discredit you.
[00:01:30.996 --> 00:01:34.979]  But I discovered you when I was learning about peak oil, and I thank you for exposing that.
[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.300]  But I have an idea.
[00:01:36.381 --> 00:01:38.983]  Your last comments were a great segue into this point.
[00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:46.393]  I have an idea of all of the thousand cuts method of warfare for your listeners to fight back against this tyranny.
[00:01:46.993 --> 00:01:53.436]  It's based on the fail video meme that's popular now on YouTube, these videos.
[00:01:54.317 --> 00:01:57.858]  They're fail videos, they're just silly things that show people failing.
[00:01:57.878 --> 00:02:03.281]  But I think that the greatest failure that we see right now is our federal government
[00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:20.726]  That's my challenge to your listeners is to not wait for you to have a contest, but to start immediately those people who are adept at making YouTube videos to start infiltrating the
[00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:23.743]  A co-opting the fail video movement.
[00:02:23.783 --> 00:02:26.365]  Well you know why the fail video movement is so popular?
[00:02:26.745 --> 00:02:31.808]  People like to see someone they think that has more wealth or power than them failing.
[00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:33.790]  I'm the opposite.
[00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.513]  I want to see people who have talent and beauty and understanding.
[00:02:39.013 --> 00:02:42.475]  I just love to see them and love to see their success.
[00:02:42.956 --> 00:02:44.497]  But what I don't like is people
[00:02:45.337 --> 00:02:48.899]  Using corruption to control and hurt innocent people.
[00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.219]  I don't want to see those people fail.
[00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.200]  I want to see them destroyed.
[00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:55.601]  Exactly right, sir.
[00:02:55.721 --> 00:02:57.182]  And essentially, they're bullies.
[00:02:57.242 --> 00:02:59.543]  And one thing a bully can't stand is to be laughed at or mocked.
[00:02:59.743 --> 00:03:03.484]  So to expose... And I have an example here.
[00:03:03.504 --> 00:03:08.546]  It's 30 seconds of what one of these videos might look like, if I may.
[00:03:08.767 --> 00:03:09.187]  Go ahead.
[00:03:10.027 --> 00:03:12.568]  Okay, this would be like the text on the screen.
[00:03:12.788 --> 00:03:14.769]  On March 30th, I'm not sure on the date,
[00:03:15.262 --> 00:03:24.750]  On March 30th, the media terrorized the nation by announcing that America was nearly attacked by an armed militia intent on taking over the government and the FBI stopped them just in time, saving us all.
[00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.174]  On March 31st, it was revealed that the nine members of the Hotari militia
[00:03:31.041 --> 00:03:37.847]  Well, the one, the only one... We're released and it was all fake and the government did it to try to sell propaganda.
[00:03:37.908 --> 00:03:38.568]  They fail.
[00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:49.198]  And when Chris Matthews does his hit piece on Rand Paul and myself next week, this big national special, we have to point out that Rand Paul's poll numbers actually went up after the last hit piece.
[00:03:49.478 --> 00:03:50.119]  They fail.
[00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:54.623]  And yes, it's important to show how the enemy is failing on every front.
[00:03:55.044 --> 00:03:56.105]  Yes, that is important.
[00:03:59.003 --> 00:04:01.684]  Right, and then on 5-3 of 2010, a U.S.
[00:04:02.184 --> 00:04:06.546]  District Judge ordered that the Huttari be released due to insufficient evidence.
[00:04:06.786 --> 00:04:23.491]  So, for blatantly staging an attack, playing the victim, and getting caught red-handed, failing to find a group who we could believe was a real threat, or at least had more teeth than toes, and using the event as an excuse to attack gun owners and further violate their oath to the Constitution and Bill of Rights, federal government equals epic fail.
[00:04:24.471 --> 00:04:26.212]  Well done, Chris!
[00:04:27.907 --> 00:04:28.427]  Absolutely.
[00:04:28.467 --> 00:04:29.147]  Good to hear from you.
[00:04:29.488 --> 00:04:30.148]  Absolutely.
[00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:43.471]  I mean, when we post people's videos on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and try to really get them going and promoted, and I see so many new one-hour, two-hour documentaries being posted on YouTube and other websites that are really good.
[00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:45.672]  And that's a good feeling.
[00:04:45.992 --> 00:04:51.433]  If they set me up or kill me next week, I've already blown the hell out of the enemy.
[00:04:53.872 --> 00:04:55.474]  We've taught everybody how to fight back.
[00:04:55.934 --> 00:04:58.096]  We've all done it together, and we're just going to get better.
[00:04:58.657 --> 00:05:01.360]  And so they're trying to move to shut the web down right now, but they'll fail at that.
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.465]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[00:05:08.186 --> 00:05:12.590]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.
[00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:27.000]  Featuring Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Joseph Farah, David Icke, Naomi Wolfe, G. Edward Griffin, Doug McIntyre, Mark Crispin Miller, Mickey Z, Doug Casey, David McElhaney, and myself, Alex Jones.
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.263]  Protect yourself and get the tools you need to protect your family from these difficult times.

[00:05:48.153 --> 00:05:51.015]  Prepare yourself and the ones you love today.
[00:05:51.055 --> 00:05:52.396]  Fallofamerica.net.
[00:06:00.424 --> 00:06:04.265]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[00:06:51.984 --> 00:06:53.345]  It's homegain.com.
[00:06:53.866 --> 00:06:56.428]  H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N.com.
[00:06:56.728 --> 00:06:57.549]  Check them out today.
[00:06:59.971 --> 00:07:02.273]  They helped to create a new world order.
[00:07:02.293 --> 00:07:04.555]  We are part of a new world order.
[00:07:04.575 --> 00:07:07.417]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[00:07:07.878 --> 00:07:12.642]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:07:13.002 --> 00:07:17.186]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:07:17.486 --> 00:07:19.829]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:22.373]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:07:22.733 --> 00:07:25.296]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:07:25.637 --> 00:07:33.247]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:07:33.587 --> 00:07:38.850]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.252]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:07:41.292 --> 00:07:45.254]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:07:45.494 --> 00:07:46.415]  And I got news for you.
[00:07:46.575 --> 00:07:47.896]  You're everyone else.
[00:07:47.916 --> 00:07:49.036]  Invisible Empire.

[00:08:10.835 --> 00:08:11.635]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.416 --> 00:08:13.337]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.357 --> 00:08:17.601]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.162 --> 00:08:22.245]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.606 --> 00:08:26.589]  We are going to continue with your phone calls here.
[00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.773]  Then I'm going to get into the economy and a more intensive news blitz on other
[00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:32.035]  I think?
[00:08:51.889 --> 00:08:52.149]  Good.
[00:08:52.169 --> 00:08:56.250]  And so that's a gauge of the audience.
[00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:01.492]  Of course, I put on air what I like, and I like the breakdowns that Watson provides.
[00:09:01.852 --> 00:09:10.734]  So he'll be with us in the last hour with huge, huge breaking news on the oil well, putting it all together in perspective and where this is going.
[00:09:11.254 --> 00:09:13.635]  Before I get to the economy, though, let's finish up with a few calls here.
[00:09:13.975 --> 00:09:15.395]  May in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:09:15.435 --> 00:09:15.755]  Welcome.
[00:09:16.415 --> 00:09:18.136]  Hi, I'm calling from Panama City.
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.404]  And we don't have the oil yet, but it's starting to come through the pass, I understand.
[00:09:24.106 --> 00:09:29.071]  I want you to hear about a company called Nalco.
[00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:33.956]  It is the maker of the dispersant that BP is using.
[00:09:34.096 --> 00:09:35.017]  It is toxic.
[00:09:35.057 --> 00:09:36.178]  It is banned in Europe.
[00:09:36.919 --> 00:09:38.580]  It has tentacles.
[00:09:40.695 --> 00:09:52.260]  Warren Buffett, Maurice Strong, Al Gore, Soros, Apollo, Blackburn... No, no, I had seen that, that it's tied into bigger chemical companies, and it's super toxic compared to crude oil that is biodegradable.
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:10:05.045]  I mean, it's not great, but crude oil compared to chemicals that they're dumping into it is... is... and that's why all the workers are getting sick that are out there being ordered to put this dispersant into the oil.
[00:10:06.045 --> 00:10:08.406]  Ordered not to speak when they're sick, too.
[00:10:09.267 --> 00:10:13.988]  And there is a better one, but it's not manufactured by Nalco.
[00:10:14.028 --> 00:10:15.329]  It's called Disperse-It.
[00:10:15.429 --> 00:10:16.509]  It's less toxic.
[00:10:17.069 --> 00:10:23.231]  It can be manufactured at 60,000 gallons a day, and they don't want to know about it.
[00:10:23.251 --> 00:10:26.072]  Well, what about the bacteria?
[00:10:26.552 --> 00:10:33.254]  The spin by mainstream news is, well, there's natural bacteria that are going to eat most of the oil anyway.
[00:10:33.514 --> 00:10:37.615]  Well, that's true, but why aren't they out there from day one spraying
[00:10:38.215 --> 00:10:54.106]  The bacteria they've got on top of it, which have no environmental impact, they're not really even engineered, they've just been bred to gobble up the oil, and then they reproduce in the oil, but you've got to put it in early so that the bacteria go with the flows of oil.
[00:10:54.466 --> 00:10:58.149]  It's hard once it's spread all over the Gulf to then go put it in pockets.
[00:10:58.269 --> 00:10:59.830]  Why did they do this?
[00:11:01.251 --> 00:11:03.332]  They do it because of the money.
[00:11:03.392 --> 00:11:06.855]  They're not going to give up, they're going to make us absolutely
[00:11:07.714 --> 00:11:08.294]  Dependent.
[00:11:08.634 --> 00:11:09.194]  Exactly.
[00:11:09.274 --> 00:11:15.636]  And FEMA got more power off of what happened with Katrina by screwing up.
[00:11:15.656 --> 00:11:16.196]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:11:16.596 --> 00:11:18.016]  It's all about cap and trade.
[00:11:18.056 --> 00:11:19.356]  They're going to push this through.
[00:11:19.796 --> 00:11:26.838]  And isn't it convenient that Al Goyle left the picture because he's getting a divorce during this crisis?
[00:11:27.058 --> 00:11:27.658]  Where is he?
[00:11:30.559 --> 00:11:32.699]  I used to dive in the Florida Keys.
[00:11:33.099 --> 00:11:36.700]  I'm 67 years old and I have a blog and I
[00:11:37.756 --> 00:11:45.464]  I beat the government up every day, and I use a lot of your material, and we listen to you two, three, maybe three times a day.
[00:11:46.165 --> 00:11:53.173]  And so we're doing our part, but this is a terrible thing, and it wasn't, I don't believe it was an accident.
[00:11:54.289 --> 00:11:55.349]  I just don't believe it.
[00:11:55.429 --> 00:11:59.251]  Ma'am, thank you, and I think your instinct and research is on target.
[00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:01.352]  We just had the big report go up.
[00:12:02.032 --> 00:12:07.594]  This is four or five days of writing and research, a month of research that goes into this.
[00:12:07.634 --> 00:12:11.855]  We've been writing this over the last, well, since last Friday, so four days.
[00:12:12.476 --> 00:12:15.937]  Evidence points to BP oil spill, false flag.
[00:12:17.532 --> 00:12:19.752]  Evidence points to BP oil spill false flag.
[00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:24.313]  Now the problem is, Google is so immoral, you can buy the search term.
[00:12:25.474 --> 00:12:29.694]  And so they're spending millions of dollars a day to have the first four pages.
[00:12:30.235 --> 00:12:46.898]  If you go to Google, and we'll do this live on PrisonPlanet.tv right now, and if you type in BP, just the letters BP, or British Petroleum, and we'll do that live on TV for folks watching, but anybody can do this online, and every page is BP.com or their subsidiaries.
[00:12:48.041 --> 00:12:49.302]  I mean, keep scrolling down.
[00:12:49.382 --> 00:12:50.022]  BP.
[00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:50.723]  BP.
[00:12:52.424 --> 00:13:02.711]  It is just amazing that they are controlling what type of news is able to make it in there.
[00:13:04.512 --> 00:13:06.153]  And they bought the term oil spill.
[00:13:07.394 --> 00:13:12.257]  Now what's interesting is, I did this last night and this morning at my house, and the first three or four pages had no one in it.
[00:13:12.798 --> 00:13:16.520]  The top ones here are BP, but some of them actually are New York Times and others.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.381]  I don't know how they're
[00:13:19.011 --> 00:13:21.932]  I guess Google might have gotten embarrassed by this and must have just changed it.
[00:13:22.172 --> 00:13:23.172]  But still, they're dominating.
[00:13:23.192 --> 00:13:29.674]  But I mean, it was nothing but BP.com, BP.com, BP.com, BP World, BP, you know, different subsidiary websites.
[00:13:29.994 --> 00:13:32.155]  Just page after page, their propaganda.
[00:13:33.415 --> 00:13:36.776]  And there's also a news blackout on the fact that there's a news blackout.
[00:13:38.578 --> 00:13:49.064]  Three weeks ago I had CBS News footage, we plug clips here, where they were trying to go to public beaches in Louisiana, and armed men would pull up and say, you're not allowed to be here, orders of BP.
[00:13:49.805 --> 00:13:53.307]  We'd say, you know, how is this continuing to happen?
[00:13:53.367 --> 00:13:55.748]  And the answer is, they're just getting away with it.
[00:13:58.254 --> 00:14:07.438]  We've got the satellite photos, folks, and the good news is most of it's staying far out to sea, and the problem is it's going to go around Florida and hit the Keys.
[00:14:07.498 --> 00:14:13.221]  It is going to really hurt the Keys, but minus the Keys, you know, the western coast of Florida,
[00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:18.444]  It is going to get hit some when it comes back around.
[00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:20.125]  The eastern coast is going to get hit some.
[00:14:21.105 --> 00:14:29.267]  But from what I've seen in the satellite images and in the computer models of how those currents flow, it could be a lot worse.
[00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:38.750]  The problem is if they don't get this fixed in the next month or two, ladies and gentlemen, when those hurricanes hit, then the flow completely changes and it just drives it into land.
[00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:43.311]  And you're going to have, it's tens of millions of gallons now.
[00:14:44.491 --> 00:14:45.692]  What is it, a half million a day?
[00:14:45.712 --> 00:14:51.077]  And it's 40-something days, and we're talking hundreds of millions of gallons is going to be hitting.
[00:14:51.177 --> 00:14:52.838]  And then you've got a problem.
[00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:55.000]  You've got a big problem.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.861]  They should have burned that off.
[00:14:57.242 --> 00:15:02.146]  They should have been out there dropping napalm on it to keep it burning from day one.
[00:15:02.406 --> 00:15:04.208]  They should have kept... And that's the old way.
[00:15:04.308 --> 00:15:05.789]  They've had lots of oil spills, folks.
[00:15:06.049 --> 00:15:06.790]  You burn them!
[00:15:08.237 --> 00:15:08.817]  Yup, yup.
[00:15:08.857 --> 00:15:11.219]  You set them on fire, folks.
[00:15:11.579 --> 00:15:12.820]  Then it's just black smoke.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:13.440]  Whoop-dee-doo.
[00:15:14.361 --> 00:15:17.263]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dave in Michigan.
[00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:18.023]  Dave, you're on the air.
[00:15:18.043 --> 00:15:20.144]  Hi, Alex.
[00:15:20.565 --> 00:15:31.391]  Regarding gold, to shift gears a little bit, I have recently been noticing a lot of TV commercials and have found a lot of websites that are offering this cash for gold.
[00:15:31.531 --> 00:15:37.295]  And my first thought about that was when seeing all this push for this, this could just be a plot to extract
[00:15:37.878 --> 00:15:38.979]  By the way, Dave, this is not a setup call.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.822]  We didn't tell you to call, correct?
[00:15:53.052 --> 00:15:53.632]  No, no.
[00:15:53.692 --> 00:16:03.134]  I've been wondering about this for a while, and in fact, when you've had Ted Anderson on, you know, over the last few weeks, I've tried to call and get on while you've had him on, and I've just never been able to get through.
[00:16:03.154 --> 00:16:06.075]  Dave, I appreciate your call.
[00:16:06.115 --> 00:16:07.895]  In fact, we'll put him on hold and get his take in a moment.
[00:16:08.355 --> 00:16:09.035]  Poor Ted.
[00:16:10.255 --> 00:16:11.356]  I get wound up, folks.
[00:16:11.416 --> 00:16:15.876]  So wound up I don't plug my own films, my own sponsors, my own books, how we fund ourselves.
[00:16:17.377 --> 00:16:18.217]  I get that wound up.
[00:16:19.332 --> 00:16:29.596]  And he was supposed to be on at 12.05 an hour ago, an hour and ten minutes, and I said, sorry, come on at 1.05, now it's 1.16, we're live here on this Tuesday edition.
[00:16:30.816 --> 00:16:36.699]  Ted's been sitting there politely off and on for an hour waiting to come on, and so I can bring him up to answer your question.
[00:16:37.199 --> 00:16:45.242]  I was wanting to get to your calls and then get into all this economic news, tax hikes, and the 2011 economic collapse, Wall Street Journal.
[00:16:46.534 --> 00:16:50.100]  Investment banker, it's going to get nasty, buy land, barbed wire and guns.
[00:16:50.861 --> 00:16:53.504]  I'm going to cover that when we come back, because now's the time to get into this.
[00:16:54.946 --> 00:17:01.155]  But, and the oil spill is serving, at many levels, as a political distraction for all of this.
[00:17:02.571 --> 00:17:06.533]  The overall global financial military takeover that's happening.
[00:17:06.953 --> 00:17:15.976]  But absolutely, you're going to see gold ads everywhere, selling gold because gold's a hot commodity and the best performing investment overall in the last seven years.
[00:17:17.597 --> 00:17:22.319]  But you're also, everywhere I see these ads for, we'll buy your junk gold.
[00:17:22.379 --> 00:17:25.000]  And I've seen, they pay about half of what it's worth.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.521]  And then they melt it down.
[00:17:27.634 --> 00:17:32.580]  And sell it to the big gold companies who then turn it into coins or ingots and sell it back to you at a premium.
[00:17:33.922 --> 00:17:42.712]  So, yes, there are more reputable places that do it, but still they deserve some markup to pay for their mortar and their taxes and their employees.
[00:17:43.253 --> 00:17:46.978]  But they shouldn't pay you under about 10% of what gold's worth.
[00:17:48.291 --> 00:17:54.853]  I've been told by the industry that's a good deal if it's not already in coin form, because they've got to then get it certified, they've then got to sell it.
[00:17:55.413 --> 00:17:58.954]  Who they're selling it to, you know, doesn't give them full market value either.
[00:17:59.354 --> 00:18:01.035]  So that's a pretty good deal if you're getting within 10%.
[00:18:01.195 --> 00:18:05.876]  If you're getting 90% of its value, but you've got to know how to value it.
[00:18:07.197 --> 00:18:10.758]  So yes, that's why you see ads everywhere, because they can't mine enough gold.
[00:18:11.118 --> 00:18:12.739]  Mints are running out all over the world.
[00:18:16.041 --> 00:18:23.209]  The real market has gold on average about $200 even for the coins that haven't been very popular.
[00:18:23.229 --> 00:18:28.674]  Krugerrands are one of the most unpopular coins in history because they're connected to the South African regime.
[00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:33.920]  Well, Krugerrands are sold out right now in many areas and there's giant premiums on them, okay?
[00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:37.859]  Same things that are seen as quite plentiful.
[00:18:37.899 --> 00:18:41.962]  British sovereigns can't get them, or there's huge premiums.
[00:18:42.443 --> 00:18:44.324]  Maple leafs can't get them, or huge premiums.
[00:18:45.265 --> 00:18:45.585]  U.S.
[00:18:45.645 --> 00:18:47.686]  buffaloes can't get them, or there's giant premiums.
[00:18:48.667 --> 00:18:50.028]  Because they're selling out everywhere.
[00:18:50.388 --> 00:18:53.411]  So see, the bankers are trying to suppress gold, but they're not successful.
[00:18:54.231 --> 00:18:58.234]  But to a certain extent they are, because gold in the real markets, $1,500 an ounce, $1,450.
[00:19:00.956 --> 00:19:05.964]  At its low, but they're telling you it's, you know, 1,250 right now.
[00:19:06.224 --> 00:19:07.786]  Let's bring Ted Anderson up briefly.
[00:19:08.067 --> 00:19:09.749]  Ted, do you agree with my analysis there?
[00:19:10.495 --> 00:19:11.336]  Yeah, I sure do.
[00:19:11.516 --> 00:19:19.621]  I tell you, you see this happening where people will set up shops to buy jewelry and what they call it scrap gold.
[00:19:19.861 --> 00:19:23.103]  As a matter of fact, in 1980 it happened too when the market surged.
[00:19:23.764 --> 00:19:30.508]  There are a lot of people that, you know, need money and they'll sell their old rings or dental or whatever they have and it needs to be smelted.
[00:19:30.548 --> 00:19:37.293]  And you're not going to get 90% because that's about what a dealer can get when they group all their gold together unless they have a large enough volume.
[00:19:37.793 --> 00:19:40.255]  And then they'll sell it to a smelter, have it assayed,
[00:19:40.715 --> 00:19:45.878]  You know, there's fees and charges and that, and then they turn it into bars and coins, just like you said.
[00:19:46.258 --> 00:19:47.899]  It's just recycling, that's all.
[00:19:48.219 --> 00:19:48.999]  All right, stay there.
[00:19:49.039 --> 00:19:51.600]  But the issue is you don't get what your gold's really worth when you do that.
[00:19:52.701 --> 00:19:53.681]  Stay there, Ted Anderson.
[00:19:53.701 --> 00:20:00.405]  I want to come back to you, talk about the explosion in the gold market today, all-time records in Europe, almost in the record here in the U.S.
[00:20:03.466 --> 00:20:04.587]  This is not a drill.
[00:20:04.687 --> 00:20:06.608]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:20:09.074 --> 00:20:16.200]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:20.643]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[00:20:20.683 --> 00:20:32.733]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns under any circumstance.
[00:20:32.833 --> 00:20:39.699]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[00:20:40.039 --> 00:20:40.700]  But listen up.
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:46.925]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[00:20:46.986 --> 00:20:48.807]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[00:20:48.827 --> 00:20:50.909]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[00:20:50.989 --> 00:20:51.490]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:53.351]  Before they come for your guns.
[00:20:53.371 --> 00:20:54.572]  Hideyourguns.com right now.
[00:21:01.477 --> 00:21:03.780]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.063]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:21:06.163 --> 00:21:09.007]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:21:09.388 --> 00:21:14.134]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:14.494 --> 00:21:18.700]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.343]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:21.463 --> 00:21:23.866]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:23.886 --> 00:21:26.789]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:27.129 --> 00:21:34.738]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:35.078 --> 00:21:40.340]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.741]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:42.781 --> 00:21:46.743]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:47.003 --> 00:21:47.903]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:48.083 --> 00:21:49.384]  You're everyone else.
[00:21:49.424 --> 00:21:50.404]  Invisible Empire.

[00:23:01.232 --> 00:23:04.395]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:23:04.775 --> 00:23:06.617]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:23:07.058 --> 00:23:07.478]  Don't!
[00:23:07.938 --> 00:23:10.961]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:23:11.382 --> 00:23:18.508]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[00:23:18.488 --> 00:23:20.150]  's number one debt secret.
[00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:24.134]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[00:23:24.514 --> 00:23:27.257]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[00:23:27.277 --> 00:23:34.706]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:23:35.046 --> 00:23:36.027]  Herb K. was right.
[00:23:36.227 --> 00:23:39.271]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:23:39.431 --> 00:23:40.451]  What have you got to lose?
[00:23:40.852 --> 00:23:41.832]  Stop the calls now!
[00:23:42.132 --> 00:23:43.833]  Get out of debt and have more money!
[00:23:44.153 --> 00:23:44.913]  Get Herb K.'
[00:23:44.853 --> 00:23:47.634]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now!
[00:23:47.654 --> 00:23:48.014]  Call 800-822-1291.
[00:23:48.034 --> 00:23:48.575]  That's 800-822-1291.
[00:23:48.595 --> 00:23:48.635]  800-822-1291.
[00:24:19.079 --> 00:24:22.980]  Look, I'm not going to belabor this because I want to get into the financial news and more of your calls.
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:29.501]  Also, the military officer that released to WikiLeaks the video of the troops killing the kids, he's being charged.
[00:24:31.822 --> 00:24:34.843]  And Bush is giving speeches saying he'd torture people again.
[00:24:35.183 --> 00:24:43.345]  But our government sent people who followed his orders to prison for the torture, but he's running around saying he would order torture again.
[00:24:43.725 --> 00:24:44.805]  What's wrong with that picture?
[00:24:46.596 --> 00:24:46.916]  Yeah, pretty much.
[00:24:46.936 --> 00:24:50.400]  And I also wanted to mention that when I Googled it, I found a ton of reviews of people
[00:25:06.829 --> 00:25:19.745]  Commenting on how they were ripped off, how the checks were very small compared to what they felt their gold was worth, asking for the gold back and not getting it, contacting the Better Business Bureau, bringing charges with their local police department.
[00:25:19.845 --> 00:25:21.688]  It seems to be a real rip-off.
[00:25:22.128 --> 00:25:23.429]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:25.651]  Again, it varies.
[00:25:25.831 --> 00:25:33.358]  There have been places, normally you want to go to a reputable place that's been there for a long time, who's in the business of buying junk gold back.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:42.326]  Obviously, you're going to get people that are going to end up not giving you that much money for it, but again, they've got a business, they've got telephones, they've got taxes.
[00:25:42.947 --> 00:25:49.696]  I mean, people expect for some reason with gold that there's going to be no markup, or in trading gold in that there's going to be, you know, no profit for them.
[00:25:49.716 --> 00:25:53.981]  And people love to complain, but I have no doubt there's scams out there, but I'm glad we can answer your question.
[00:25:54.362 --> 00:26:00.089]  The answer is to get high-quality, certified bullion or certified coins, and to...
[00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:03.233]  Buy gold instead of selling gold.
[00:26:03.995 --> 00:26:04.936]  And now is the time.
[00:26:05.256 --> 00:26:10.344]  I mean, Ted Anderson, they're now in the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times saying people are going to buy gold.
[00:26:11.586 --> 00:26:12.908]  Tell folks where gold is today.
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:14.381]  Yeah, sure.
[00:26:14.621 --> 00:26:17.563]  Gold hit a peak that it's never seen before today so far at $1,252.30.
[00:26:18.064 --> 00:26:20.927]  So it did break its previous U.S.
[00:26:20.987 --> 00:26:21.727]  record, excuse me.
[00:26:22.088 --> 00:26:23.949]  It did, but it hasn't closed at that.
[00:26:23.969 --> 00:26:28.293]  So usually when they say gold hit a record peak, they go off the close.
[00:26:28.373 --> 00:26:34.559]  So the market's still open, but the last peak was $1,251 and change, and now it's seen a high of $1,252.30.
[00:26:34.639 --> 00:26:35.840]  So right now presently $1,244.20.
[00:26:39.083 --> 00:26:44.948]  So, yeah, it's definitely strong today, Alex, and people are buying because they want security.
[00:26:45.289 --> 00:26:48.732]  They want to get out of paper currency, and they want to hold on to gold.
[00:26:49.052 --> 00:26:50.033]  Your caller's right.
[00:26:50.073 --> 00:27:03.465]  I mean, there's a lot of people that do get ripped off out there, you know, and, you know, you really have to beware because just about, you know, there's so many people that come out of the woodwork to buy, you know, people's jewelry, and it can get to be really ugly.
[00:27:03.865 --> 00:27:07.506]  Yeah, but that digresses us down a rabbit trail, but I'm glad we can answer that.
[00:27:08.426 --> 00:27:10.446]  We're not in the junk gold business, folks.
[00:27:10.506 --> 00:27:15.287]  We're in the business of selling you gold, not buying your gold.
[00:27:15.587 --> 00:27:17.868]  Though, Ted, you do buy people's gold back, don't you?
[00:27:18.108 --> 00:27:18.848]  We sure do.
[00:27:19.548 --> 00:27:21.828]  And you're right, I'm not in the scrap business.
[00:27:21.908 --> 00:27:24.009]  If somebody needed to sell me scrap, they could.
[00:27:24.449 --> 00:27:26.309]  But that's not my particular goal.
[00:27:26.709 --> 00:27:30.050]  I handle coins that are very recognizable, like the British Sovereign.
[00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:31.831]  The Frank, the U.S.
[00:27:31.911 --> 00:27:32.152]  Eagle.
[00:27:32.312 --> 00:27:34.834]  We just picked up a supply of buffalos, by the way.
[00:27:35.314 --> 00:27:37.176]  You know, those are coins... Oh, excuse me?
[00:27:37.736 --> 00:27:38.697]  I want one of those.
[00:27:39.658 --> 00:27:40.899]  You got some buffalos in?
[00:27:41.139 --> 00:27:41.819]  Yep, we did.
[00:27:41.839 --> 00:27:44.101]  Yeah, we were able to secure a nice supply of those.
[00:27:44.241 --> 00:27:49.205]  Now, Ted, I read in the news, anybody can go Google this and search it, that there's huge premiums.
[00:27:49.225 --> 00:27:56.911]  You know, gold is $1,242 right now, you know, at its all-time high in the U.S., all-time high in Europe.
[00:27:57.552 --> 00:27:58.373]  But that's not what
[00:27:59.053 --> 00:28:00.654]  Coin companies are selling it for.
[00:28:00.914 --> 00:28:08.236]  I mean, I've seen huge $200 premiums on an ounce of gold that is bullion class.
[00:28:09.477 --> 00:28:12.238]  So how are you able to sell it lower than that?
[00:28:12.838 --> 00:28:17.780]  And I know the answer, you bought it when it was lower and you're still selling it even though gold's higher with the discount.
[00:28:18.482 --> 00:28:21.403]  Well, you know, obviously that's what I try to do.
[00:28:21.443 --> 00:28:28.787]  I'm not getting a lot of opportunity right now because, you know, this last little dip that came along, I only had about two or three days to stock up.
[00:28:29.407 --> 00:28:31.068]  But, yeah, that's what I do.
[00:28:32.048 --> 00:28:37.411]  What happens is when people put demand on a finite supply, like British Sovereign, for example,
[00:28:37.791 --> 00:28:38.953]  They're not making those anymore.
[00:28:38.973 --> 00:28:40.596]  They were made back in the early 1900s.
[00:28:40.856 --> 00:28:43.861]  The supply that's there is it.
[00:28:44.161 --> 00:28:49.069]  When people come into the marketplace with literally billions of dollars to buy gold coins...
[00:28:49.741 --> 00:28:53.803]  You know, you're putting a lot of pressure on a coin and they start bidding up the premiums.
[00:28:54.304 --> 00:28:56.325]  You know, people see it on eBay, they see it everywhere.
[00:28:56.365 --> 00:28:57.305]  It's the same thing.
[00:28:57.565 --> 00:28:59.326]  You have supply and then you have demand.
[00:28:59.627 --> 00:29:08.432]  And now the Russian government, the Iranians, others are pouring in, the Indians, the Japanese, the Chinese, Europeans who always look down their nose at gold.
[00:29:08.512 --> 00:29:10.373]  They like big socialist governments.
[00:29:11.413 --> 00:29:14.115]  And boy, look how that ended up for them.
[00:29:14.776 --> 00:29:17.157]  And you've got all these open announcements of collapse.
[00:29:17.438 --> 00:29:19.239]  I hope we aren't going to have a full collapse.
[00:29:19.759 --> 00:29:22.541]  But by and large, NAFTA and GATT has already collapsed our industry.
[00:29:22.921 --> 00:29:24.262]  It's already collapsed our society.
[00:29:24.603 --> 00:29:27.845]  Now is the time to get into silver half-dollars, to get into gold coins.
[00:29:27.905 --> 00:29:30.567]  Here's the toll-free number to call today, 800-686-2237.
[00:29:30.587 --> 00:29:30.627]  800-686-2237.
[00:29:36.911 --> 00:29:38.592]  2237, the brokers are there right now.
[00:29:38.912 --> 00:29:41.173]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you to get the lower prices.
[00:29:41.393 --> 00:29:45.955]  But I forgot to ask you, Ted, what you think your best deals on gold and silver are today.
[00:29:46.215 --> 00:29:47.676]  So tell us that offer when we come back.
[00:29:47.896 --> 00:29:49.957]  Then I'm getting into the economy, your calls, and a lot more.
[00:29:51.237 --> 00:29:52.137]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.618 --> 00:29:54.218]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.159 --> 00:29:57.840]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.242]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[00:30:53.976 --> 00:30:54.437]  Thank you!
[00:31:00.307 --> 00:31:05.150]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:06.031]  What have we got?
[00:31:06.271 --> 00:31:08.412]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:31:08.713 --> 00:31:09.433]  A republic.
[00:31:09.713 --> 00:31:12.295]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:31:12.355 --> 00:31:14.276]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:31:14.636 --> 00:31:16.538]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:31:16.658 --> 00:31:17.919]  So they think they own our land?
[00:31:18.339 --> 00:31:19.460]  They think they own our water?
[00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:20.060]  Children?
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:21.041]  Our education?
[00:31:21.381 --> 00:31:21.981]  Our money?
[00:31:22.201 --> 00:31:25.864]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:31:26.224 --> 00:31:29.869]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:31:31.211 --> 00:31:32.032]  We have the facts.
[00:31:32.232 --> 00:31:33.333]  We have the Constitution.
[00:31:33.373 --> 00:31:34.275]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:31:34.295 --> 00:31:35.116]  We have common law.
[00:31:35.176 --> 00:31:37.439]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:37.699 --> 00:31:41.484]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:31:41.564 --> 00:31:46.367]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:31:46.527 --> 00:31:47.907]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:31:48.028 --> 00:31:48.888]  Don't tread on me.
[00:31:49.108 --> 00:31:55.972]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:32:00.074 --> 00:32:04.295]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:04.615 --> 00:32:04.895]  Number 1.
[00:32:05.535 --> 00:32:08.696]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:08.956 --> 00:32:09.516]  Number 2.
[00:32:09.816 --> 00:32:14.358]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:14.698 --> 00:32:15.158]  It's true.
[00:32:15.458 --> 00:32:19.999]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:20.319 --> 00:32:20.859]  Number 3.
[00:32:21.139 --> 00:32:24.420]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:28.421]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:28.641 --> 00:32:29.182]  Number 4.
[00:32:29.442 --> 00:32:31.804]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:32.204 --> 00:32:35.587]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:35.887 --> 00:32:36.088]  Number 5.
[00:32:36.668 --> 00:32:40.591]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:40.812 --> 00:32:45.576]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:45.856 --> 00:32:49.879]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:50.039 --> 00:32:51.600]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.901]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:32:54.062 --> 00:32:55.823]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:32:55.963 --> 00:32:56.043]  Yeah!
[00:33:14.841 --> 00:33:17.823]  Now they grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
[00:33:17.863 --> 00:33:20.304]  They used to grow food in Kansas.
[00:33:21.685 --> 00:33:23.886]  Yeah, now they grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
[00:33:25.687 --> 00:33:28.709]  I can see a day when even having your own garden will be against the law.
[00:33:29.049 --> 00:33:30.630]  They're now passing laws all over the world.
[00:33:33.572 --> 00:33:35.654]  Even in Oklahoma they're trying to ban gardens.
[00:33:35.974 --> 00:33:37.615]  Because you might grow pot.
[00:33:39.124 --> 00:33:40.425]  You need to have a police inspection.
[00:33:40.965 --> 00:33:42.447]  We don't let prisoners.
[00:33:42.507 --> 00:33:44.168]  You're a prisoner of the New World Order.
[00:33:44.628 --> 00:33:47.451]  We don't let you grow plants without an inspection.
[00:33:47.471 --> 00:33:50.893]  Democracy don't rule the world.
[00:33:51.214 --> 00:33:55.377]  You better get that through your head.
[00:33:57.799 --> 00:33:59.420]  You know, Bob Dylan is a patriot.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.661]  He knows all about the New World Order.
[00:34:01.302 --> 00:34:02.643]  I'm just going to let you know that.
[00:34:02.703 --> 00:34:03.684]  I can't tell you how I know.
[00:34:07.062 --> 00:34:09.684]  But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.
[00:34:09.704 --> 00:34:15.328]  That's a lot of real estate indeed!
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.622]  Alright, I'm gonna go to your calls and a bunch of other news.
[00:34:23.203 --> 00:34:26.165]  It's just, this is such heavy subjects, I gotta have some fun with it.
[00:34:26.466 --> 00:34:27.427]  It's gallows humor.
[00:34:27.907 --> 00:34:41.281]  You know, when you're about to be hung, a lot of men, it was written in the annals, especially in England, would either beg and plead, or they would be quiet, or they would say prayers, or they would make jokes and have fun.
[00:34:42.682 --> 00:34:44.404]  And enjoy themselves.
[00:34:45.885 --> 00:34:56.124]  And many of the reports are they would look up at the sky and take a big, delicious breath of fresh air before they got their neck snapped at the end of a rope.
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:00.940]  And so I try to be positive because I'd go crazy if I wasn't.
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:04.381]  I mean, I live in a country, I live in a world run by a scientific dictatorship.
[00:35:04.501 --> 00:35:06.081]  I know they're destroying the economy by design.
[00:35:06.101 --> 00:35:09.002]  I know they're poisoning our food and water by design on record.
[00:35:09.482 --> 00:35:14.483]  I know all the major GMO food lines sterilize every rat, every guinea pig they feed it to.
[00:35:15.323 --> 00:35:17.683]  And I know full well they're running their operation against us.
[00:35:18.683 --> 00:35:26.945]  And that 99.9% of us are in the same boat together, black, white, old, young, and that we, Hispanic, Jewish, Chinese,
[00:35:28.061 --> 00:35:34.943]  Whatever you are, you're under attack, and we better grow up, and we better set the agenda of saying no to the New World Order.
[00:35:36.823 --> 00:35:38.944]  People say, well, if that's all true, why aren't you dead?
[00:35:38.984 --> 00:35:43.225]  Because there's too many of us speaking out, because it would highlight everything I've said, everything I've done.
[00:35:44.505 --> 00:35:51.907]  Somebody sent me a video of Bill Cooper, who had his problems, but he also was a talented radio host and author, and it was him saying, why aren't I dead yet?
[00:35:52.887 --> 00:35:56.188]  And he said basically what I've said, uh, that, uh,
[00:35:58.775 --> 00:35:59.536]  He would be a martyr.
[00:36:00.136 --> 00:36:02.238]  It would then underline and highlight everything he'd said.
[00:36:02.998 --> 00:36:04.760]  Well, in the end they did kill him.
[00:36:06.862 --> 00:36:09.584]  And I certainly get my share of death threats, so it could come at any time.
[00:36:10.825 --> 00:36:15.448]  It's just... A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.
[00:36:16.585 --> 00:36:17.626]  And I'm going to tell the truth.
[00:36:17.726 --> 00:36:20.008]  I mean, I couldn't sit here knowing this.
[00:36:20.528 --> 00:36:25.512]  That's the biggest frustration, is so many people know this information and they don't take action with it.
[00:36:26.213 --> 00:36:28.795]  So many people go look it up and find out, my gosh, it's true.
[00:36:29.155 --> 00:36:37.722]  Every major GMO crop line from four different major companies sterilizes every mammal it comes in contact with, totally fries them and gives them cancer, attacks their liver.
[00:36:38.522 --> 00:36:44.367]  Let's go to dinner, honey, and feed the kids a bowl full of corn chips.
[00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:46.591]  That are GMO?
[00:36:46.651 --> 00:36:48.153]  I mean, what are we?
[00:36:48.214 --> 00:36:50.597]  Would you give your kid Jack Daniels every day?
[00:36:52.338 --> 00:36:53.279]  Yeah, you might as well!
[00:36:53.579 --> 00:37:00.022]  It's better for their liver than many of the GMO corn strains, the majority of what we're eating.
[00:37:00.262 --> 00:37:01.303]  Look, I'm already digressing.
[00:37:02.763 --> 00:37:04.624]  At a certain point, this is all I can talk about.
[00:37:04.865 --> 00:37:07.086]  They're chemtrailing us, they're poisoning the food and the water.
[00:37:07.386 --> 00:37:16.831]  It's now all admitted, and people are running around freaking out about the Gulf being hit by oil, and they're using deadly chemicals far worse than the oil to do something about it.
[00:37:16.871 --> 00:37:18.472]  But I'm going to shut up, because I want to go to your calls.
[00:37:20.219 --> 00:37:24.361]  Ted, I mean, obviously Midas Resources owns the network and you're a big sponsor of my show.
[00:37:25.562 --> 00:37:32.006]  But I always get you on even when you're not sponsoring, above and beyond your sponsorship, because I buy gold, I buy silver.
[00:37:33.967 --> 00:37:41.851]  Over the years, I haven't had a lot of money, but I've bought some silver here, some gold there, and gotten a tidy hoard as an emergency backup.
[00:37:41.871 --> 00:37:43.452]  If everything implodes, I'll have something.
[00:37:43.612 --> 00:37:46.154]  I mean, it's not a dragon's treasure or anything.
[00:37:46.174 --> 00:37:47.795]  It's not Captain Kidd's treasure.
[00:37:48.415 --> 00:37:53.356]  But, I mean, people, if they make decisions, can get into gold and silver, and I happen to know, because I've shopped.
[00:37:53.977 --> 00:37:58.498]  I've bought gold a few other places before, and I've found you've got the best deals when it's these specials.
[00:37:59.618 --> 00:38:05.420]  You know, you've got collector coins and other stuff that's available that are great deals, but when it comes to bullion, these are the best deals people are going to find.
[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:16.523]  Tell people about the best coin offers you've got today, and what you've got available as others are running out or putting huge premiums on it, and when prices are going to go up, how long you can hold it at this lower price.
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:22.664]  Well, I mean, obviously, one of the great coins to be buying is that Buffalo piece, but we do have the Frank.
[00:38:23.164 --> 00:38:26.927]  It is, you know, I'm just happy to be able to sell them, actually.
[00:38:27.267 --> 00:38:31.531]  They're at $265, so the premium's actually low on them.
[00:38:32.031 --> 00:38:38.236]  It's a fractional piece of gold, so, you know, when it comes down to barter and trade, it's great for that.
[00:38:38.556 --> 00:38:45.759]  And I'm not trying to be mean, but the coin dealer that Lindbeck promotes, it was in the news, and I went and checked it, it was true.
[00:38:46.479 --> 00:38:51.842]  Six months ago, when gold was a lot less, was selling the same francs for $360 apiece.
[00:38:52.062 --> 00:38:54.063]  Well, and it's not just that gold dealer.
[00:38:54.083 --> 00:38:55.423]  They're across the United States.
[00:38:55.523 --> 00:38:56.163]  Let's explain.
[00:38:56.203 --> 00:39:06.688]  You have it $256, and I haven't gotten the sheet lately, but normally when I see these francs, you're making $4 on them, and that's when you bought them when it was lower.
[00:39:08.686 --> 00:39:11.127]  And they're just a touch higher than that right now.
[00:39:11.167 --> 00:39:12.128]  They're $2.65.
[00:39:12.348 --> 00:39:12.528]  Oh, $2.65.
[00:39:12.748 --> 00:39:13.989]  So they've gone up a bit.
[00:39:14.229 --> 00:39:15.289]  Yeah, just a little bit.
[00:39:15.309 --> 00:39:16.250]  I mean, but look at gold.
[00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:17.431]  I mean, what has gone on there?
[00:39:17.451 --> 00:39:19.351]  I mean, gold has hit a peak that it's never seen.
[00:39:19.372 --> 00:39:20.292]  Well, that's better than $3.60.
[00:39:21.312 --> 00:39:22.053]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:39:22.093 --> 00:39:24.694]  It's a huge discount to what's going on out there in the real world.
[00:39:24.754 --> 00:39:30.717]  But the same thing is that, you know, if you buy one of these coins, I'm going to buy a Bob Chapman's International Forecaster for a year.
[00:39:30.777 --> 00:39:31.978]  Yeah, that's $156 right there.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:39.422]  Subtract that from the cost of the coin, I mean, you come up for about $500 an ounce for gold.
[00:39:39.962 --> 00:39:43.663]  I mean, you can't, you couldn't buy gold at $500 an ounce anymore.
[00:39:43.903 --> 00:39:46.924]  You'd have to go back about 10 years to find gold at that price.
[00:39:47.604 --> 00:39:50.345]  And so that is just a fabulous buy.
[00:39:50.965 --> 00:39:53.246]  And then, of course, the Walking Liberty halves are great at $9.75.
[00:39:53.846 --> 00:39:57.227]  You know, gold now approaching $1,300 an ounce.
[00:39:59.307 --> 00:40:06.216]  And older, you know, 100-year-old $20 Liberties that were used here as currency, as money, they call those numismatics now.
[00:40:06.636 --> 00:40:11.082]  But they do contain, just short of an ounce of gold, they're at $1,518.
[00:40:11.823 --> 00:40:14.746]  I was able to lower their price even though gold has gone up.
[00:40:15.847 --> 00:40:16.768]  Yeah, let's explain.
[00:40:16.828 --> 00:40:18.549]  You're a big gold and silver dealer.
[00:40:18.989 --> 00:40:22.491]  You don't buy this stuff at what the melt price is.
[00:40:22.591 --> 00:40:25.893]  Some people, because there's some dealers that claim, we have it at melt.
[00:40:26.233 --> 00:40:27.054]  That's not true.
[00:40:27.574 --> 00:40:29.935]  Okay, so there's a lot of bait and switching.
[00:40:29.955 --> 00:40:32.577]  The best deals I've found are Ted Anderson, 800-686-2237.
[00:40:32.777 --> 00:40:39.581]  We usually spend a few minutes, once or twice a week on this, but we're spending a lot more time today because this is
[00:40:39.721 --> 00:40:40.421]  Big news.
[00:40:40.521 --> 00:40:43.402]  Gold at all-time high in the US and in Europe.
[00:40:43.622 --> 00:40:44.922]  We'll see if it closes at that.
[00:40:45.462 --> 00:40:48.643]  But regardless, they're not going to be able to suppress the price much longer.
[00:40:48.943 --> 00:40:50.124]  They have been unsuccessful.
[00:40:50.164 --> 00:40:56.385]  And the market is trading way higher than what supposed unattainable spot gold is at.
[00:40:56.465 --> 00:40:59.826]  So we're seeing this is a rigged market right now, now more than ever.
[00:40:59.946 --> 00:41:02.187]  Even the rigged market is going up in price.
[00:41:02.227 --> 00:41:04.267]  But the real market is what, Ted?
[00:41:04.307 --> 00:41:05.387]  Am I right just from watching?
[00:41:05.407 --> 00:41:06.768]  This is my layman's analysis.
[00:41:07.668 --> 00:41:13.734]  Gold selling $200, $300 more an ounce even for bullion than what the market says spot gold is?
[00:41:14.155 --> 00:41:16.758]  There are most certainly cases of that, that's true.
[00:41:18.379 --> 00:41:23.124]  Most of the stuff that I have right now is going to be closer to somewhere between $40,000
[00:41:24.864 --> 00:41:26.524]  Maybe $50 over spot.
[00:41:26.925 --> 00:41:34.926]  But there are some circumstances, like take that British Sovereign right now, they've shot up like crazy and there's just no supply.
[00:41:35.467 --> 00:41:42.128]  I just see reports of the American Eagles for $1,500 and I see gold at $1,242, so I'm trying to figure that out.
[00:41:42.348 --> 00:41:45.089]  Yeah, you definitely are seeing a lot of that out there right now.
[00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:47.890]  Okay, but to be clear then, you've got
[00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:51.411]  Franks that are 265?
[00:41:51.691 --> 00:41:54.073]  Yeah, 265 apiece.
[00:41:54.113 --> 00:41:55.514]  They're a fifth of an ounce of gold.
[00:41:56.315 --> 00:41:58.036]  So you take five of them to make an ounce.
[00:41:58.056 --> 00:42:01.919]  So there is a little bit of a premium over spot, but you have a smaller piece.
[00:42:02.499 --> 00:42:04.621]  Fractional gold coins always carry a premium.
[00:42:05.041 --> 00:42:10.004]  And in order to help you with that premium, we're buying a full year subscription to Bob Chapman's musical.
[00:42:10.104 --> 00:42:11.385]  And then what are some of the other coins?
[00:42:11.545 --> 00:42:13.567]  We know you have the Buffalos that are really hard to get.
[00:42:13.867 --> 00:42:14.888]  What other coins have you gotten?
[00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:17.292]  Well, then, of course, you can get the U.S.
[00:42:17.372 --> 00:42:20.316]  Eagle, and they're just trading just a little over $1,300 a piece.
[00:42:20.376 --> 00:42:22.138]  And then the Walking Liberty Half, $9.75.
[00:42:22.178 --> 00:42:23.379]  Those on the Internet are well over $10 now.
[00:42:28.859 --> 00:42:30.079]  Lakota Nation's at $23.55.
[00:42:30.119 --> 00:42:36.841]  That's a good buy, because silver's been running up, and those were sitting at about $25 just a short time ago.
[00:42:36.861 --> 00:42:40.662]  Plus, you're supporting a patriotic network.
[00:42:40.982 --> 00:42:41.782]  Don't wait, folks.
[00:42:42.183 --> 00:42:43.783]  I believe you should get involved in gold and silver.
[00:42:43.923 --> 00:42:46.484]  I have personally, and it's really done well for me.
[00:42:46.504 --> 00:42:46.544]  800-686-2237.
[00:42:46.564 --> 00:42:46.904]  800-686-237.
[00:42:46.984 --> 00:42:48.224]  Or you can go buy elsewhere.
[00:42:48.244 --> 00:42:48.804]  $360 for a franc.
[00:42:55.606 --> 00:42:56.246]  Or you can pay $265.
[00:42:58.107 --> 00:42:58.647]  I don't know.
[00:42:58.967 --> 00:43:00.667]  You make the decision.
[00:43:00.687 --> 00:43:02.688]  800-686-2237.
[00:43:02.868 --> 00:43:03.568]  God bless you, Ted.
[00:43:03.848 --> 00:43:04.768]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[00:43:04.828 --> 00:43:05.988]  And your audience is wonderful.
[00:43:06.008 --> 00:43:06.929]  Thank them, too, for me.
[00:43:06.949 --> 00:43:07.429]  Will you please?
[00:43:07.569 --> 00:43:07.889]  You bet.
[00:43:07.949 --> 00:43:08.429]  God bless you.
[00:43:08.449 --> 00:43:09.669]  Well, you just thanked them just there.
[00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:12.470]  OK, let me get on some of the financial news.
[00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:19.491]  And I promise, ahead of Watson coming on with all of the BP oil spill breakdown, he's going to methodically cover every angle of it.
[00:43:19.511 --> 00:43:20.372]  You know how Watson does.
[00:43:22.796 --> 00:43:29.221]  And again, he's been popping in yesterday and today for one hour just to take his training wheels off as a guest host.
[00:43:29.281 --> 00:43:30.622]  So that's what we're doing right now with Watson.
[00:43:30.982 --> 00:43:32.343]  And he's done better than I thought he would.
[00:43:32.383 --> 00:43:33.064]  An excellent job.
[00:43:33.364 --> 00:43:35.806]  So I look forward to him coming up in the next hour.
[00:43:37.707 --> 00:43:42.030]  I want to go to Dante, Quincy, Morgan, Donna.
[00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:44.332]  I will at least get to you guys before the hour ends.
[00:43:44.372 --> 00:43:46.554]  But let me get into this economic news right now.
[00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:52.442]  In fact, do we have that MSNBC clip with the guy talking about buy land and barbed wire?
[00:43:53.824 --> 00:43:54.564]  We have that queued up?
[00:43:54.584 --> 00:43:55.945]  We're going to play that in a moment.
[00:43:56.326 --> 00:43:57.867]  And again, this is just two articles.
[00:43:58.608 --> 00:44:00.229]  I've got a whole bunch of these today.
[00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:03.011]  This is out of the Wall Street Journal.
[00:44:03.572 --> 00:44:06.975]  Tax hikes and the 2011 economic collapse.
[00:44:07.375 --> 00:44:10.758]  Today's corporate profits reflect an income shift in 2010.
[00:44:11.158 --> 00:44:12.680]  These profits will tumble next year.
[00:44:15.029 --> 00:44:19.092]  Proceeded most likely by the stock market, so the stock market will most likely tumble.
[00:44:19.893 --> 00:44:21.854]  And this is the Wall Street Journal.
[00:44:22.034 --> 00:44:24.856]  Arthur Laffer is very respected.
[00:44:24.896 --> 00:44:31.501]  People can change the volume, the location, and the composition of their income, and they can do so in response to changes in government policies.
[00:44:31.882 --> 00:44:42.170]  It shouldn't surprise anyone that the nine states with an income tax are growing far faster and attracting... It shouldn't surprise you that the nine states without, excuse me, without
[00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:49.396]  a income tax are growing far faster and attracting more people than the United States with the highest income tax.
[00:44:49.456 --> 00:44:53.680]  People and businesses are changing the location of income based on incentives.
[00:44:54.201 --> 00:44:59.566]  And then it just goes into how taxes have been raised all over the country and federally, how California's bombing out
[00:45:00.306 --> 00:45:07.688]  And how, when they raise taxes, they destroy economies, and they have graphs that show all of that, and that is absolutely true.
[00:45:08.288 --> 00:45:11.429]  And so, but Texas supposedly doesn't have an income tax.
[00:45:11.869 --> 00:45:13.209]  They got a franchise tax.
[00:45:13.509 --> 00:45:14.730]  They got a business tax.
[00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:16.690]  They're raping the daylights out of us folks.
[00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:19.271]  I mean, it is disgusting.
[00:45:20.308 --> 00:45:23.450]  You ought to see the taxes I pay on the desk and the microphone.
[00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:26.591]  It's a property tax is what it really is.
[00:45:27.671 --> 00:45:29.472]  And it just makes me want to shut down.
[00:45:29.512 --> 00:45:32.554]  But I can't because I got to fight the New World Order.
[00:45:34.795 --> 00:45:35.835]  I don't even want to make money.
[00:45:36.355 --> 00:45:39.817]  I just want to pay for things and be able to run my operation and pay my employees.
[00:45:41.098 --> 00:45:45.960]  But they've got it all rigged now with all these new taxes where you pay taxes on everything.
[00:45:47.895 --> 00:45:51.237]  And then it makes you want to not pay the taxes, and then they get to throw you in prison.
[00:45:53.018 --> 00:45:54.939]  And more and more of the money goes to offshore banks.
[00:45:54.999 --> 00:45:56.359]  It just all goes to them.
[00:45:57.340 --> 00:46:00.862]  They raise your taxes, they cut your supposed benefits.
[00:46:01.182 --> 00:46:02.322]  They cut your supposed...
[00:46:04.312 --> 00:46:04.852]  Services.
[00:46:05.133 --> 00:46:06.073]  You're seeing it everywhere.
[00:46:06.494 --> 00:46:08.015]  This is the New World Order model.
[00:46:08.455 --> 00:46:09.076]  Here's another one.
[00:46:09.396 --> 00:46:10.296]  Investment banker.
[00:46:10.357 --> 00:46:11.397]  It's going to get nasty.
[00:46:11.437 --> 00:46:13.499]  Buy land, barbed wire and guns.
[00:46:13.799 --> 00:46:15.040]  What did I tell you four years ago?
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.862]  Austin is the richest city per capita in the country.
[00:46:18.603 --> 00:46:20.944]  Everybody's fleeing New York and L.A.
[00:46:21.004 --> 00:46:25.668]  and Chicago and Miami and Palm Beach.
[00:46:27.269 --> 00:46:29.591]  And I'm a media person.
[00:46:30.683 --> 00:46:43.931]  And working in media and being at events and phone calls and meetings I've had, I've met billionaires, quite a few of them, I mean real billionaires, people that are on the Forbes list, not fake billionaires that are a dime a dozen, you know, at the country club telling you they're a billionaire.
[00:46:44.991 --> 00:46:47.533]  And for four years, they have all been leaving the country.
[00:46:48.093 --> 00:46:51.735]  And I told you about John Wayne's family, a big portion of them leaving the country.
[00:46:52.236 --> 00:46:53.116]  They've made the decision.
[00:46:55.037 --> 00:46:55.718]  They're all leaving!
[00:46:56.852 --> 00:47:02.959]  They're going to Costa Rica, and it looks like the CIA and others are going to keep that somewhat free for a while, though they're set on a police state there.
[00:47:02.979 --> 00:47:04.120]  They're going to loot Switzerland.
[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:06.202]  They're going to loot the Cook Islands.
[00:47:06.803 --> 00:47:07.824]  There's really nowhere to run.
[00:47:07.884 --> 00:47:08.545]  Luxembourg.
[00:47:11.004 --> 00:47:11.865]  Monte Carlo.
[00:47:12.846 --> 00:47:13.806]  There's nowhere to go.
[00:47:13.946 --> 00:47:18.890]  The bankers, unless you're a multi-multi-multi-billionaire, they're even robbing the billionaires.
[00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:20.532]  They're robbing the people worth $100 million.
[00:47:20.852 --> 00:47:22.513]  They're robbing the people worth $500 million.
[00:47:23.154 --> 00:47:24.495]  They are taking it all.
[00:47:24.755 --> 00:47:26.256]  They don't want a middle class.
[00:47:26.296 --> 00:47:28.058]  They don't want a rich nouveau riche.
[00:47:28.538 --> 00:47:33.722]  They wage war against middle class, against poor people, against new wealth.
[00:47:34.463 --> 00:47:39.705]  Nouveau riche, new wealthy, they do not want you to have two pennies to rub together.
[00:47:39.745 --> 00:47:41.865]  This is their tool of control.
[00:47:41.905 --> 00:47:43.646]  What did the London Guardian find out at Bilderberg?
[00:47:44.346 --> 00:47:49.087]  That they want to bankrupt us to make us where we're so poor, we don't have money to go protest them.
[00:47:52.868 --> 00:47:54.829]  Investment banker, it's going to get nasty.
[00:47:54.889 --> 00:47:57.049]  Buy land, barbed wire and guns.
[00:47:57.089 --> 00:47:58.470]  Let's go ahead and play that clip.
[00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:01.451]  Do we have it queued up to the spot where he talks about the barbed wire and guns?
[00:48:01.671 --> 00:48:01.991]  Here it is.
[00:48:02.918 --> 00:48:09.002]  He is Senior Managing Director at Evercore Partners, an investment banker to his roots.
[00:48:10.002 --> 00:48:14.405]  Do you think that T-Jan, T-Anne was given the right advice by his banking advisors?
[00:48:15.065 --> 00:48:16.746]  That's a great one for first thing in the morning.
[00:48:16.766 --> 00:48:17.307]  Thank you for that.
[00:48:17.467 --> 00:48:18.047]  Let's start strong.
[00:48:21.229 --> 00:48:25.172]  Well, I mean, clearly, the situation is incredibly messy now.
[00:48:25.332 --> 00:48:28.314]  And I think the shareholders have put themselves into quite a tricky position.
[00:48:28.334 --> 00:48:34.738]  I mean, on the one hand, everyone's sort of... A lot of the newspapers, a lot of the coverage is praising shareholders for standing up and saying, we don't want to do this.
[00:48:35.218 --> 00:48:37.079]  On the other hand, what message does that send to management?
[00:48:37.159 --> 00:48:39.601]  Management of the board put forward a strategy.
[00:48:40.041 --> 00:48:41.001]  Shareholders rejected.
[00:48:41.482 --> 00:48:42.643]  What do the shareholders now do?
[00:48:42.663 --> 00:48:49.367]  Do you sort of say to the managers, well, we may think your strategy is completely wrong, but keep on going anyhow?
[00:48:50.107 --> 00:48:51.348]  Are they going to take some other action?
[00:48:52.208 --> 00:48:55.650]  That's a seven minute clip, and I thought I'd told them where to cue it up, but I hadn't.
[00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:58.711]  So we're going to cue it up, play it after the break, the specific part.
[00:48:58.752 --> 00:48:59.772]  This is a seven minute clip.
[00:49:00.412 --> 00:49:06.275]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com if you want to watch the whole clip, and also read the article by Paul Joseph Watson this morning.
[00:49:06.635 --> 00:49:07.536]  Investment banker.
[00:49:07.596 --> 00:49:08.596]  It's going to get nasty.
[00:49:08.656 --> 00:49:11.278]  Buy land, barbed wire, and guns.
[00:49:14.082 --> 00:49:20.005]  And what have we seen mayors and police chiefs and sheriffs from California to Ohio say in the last two months?
[00:49:20.565 --> 00:49:21.866]  We're laying off 47%.
[00:49:22.086 --> 00:49:23.226]  We're laying off 65%.
[00:49:23.526 --> 00:49:35.052]  You know, we're going from 144 to 42 sheriff's deputies in the entire county, and only three of them will be allowed each day, one shift, to respond to crime.
[00:49:35.532 --> 00:49:38.433]  Our other deputies will be writing tickets and raising money.
[00:49:38.893 --> 00:49:39.654]  Arm yourselves!
[00:49:41.018 --> 00:49:43.560]  Well, what sheriff couldn't morally say, arm yourselves?
[00:49:44.441 --> 00:49:46.043]  Arm yourselves!
[00:49:46.763 --> 00:49:48.825]  The government isn't going to protect you.
[00:49:49.245 --> 00:49:55.711]  And there is a serious potential for the complete and total collapse of society.
[00:49:56.412 --> 00:50:00.836]  There is a serious potential for the complete collapse.
[00:50:01.797 --> 00:50:05.740]  Look, I go back to basic numbers, because this is the stuff keeping me up at night.
[00:50:06.521 --> 00:50:07.482]  It's very elementary.
[00:50:10.037 --> 00:50:26.460]  University studies show that millions and millions, some studies as high as seven, some even higher, millions starved to death during the 10-year Great Depression, with 90% or right at 90% of the public being agrarian, living on the land, being self-sufficient, having chickens out back.
[00:50:28.464 --> 00:50:33.089]  We're now almost 90% urban and don't know how to change our oil.
[00:50:33.409 --> 00:50:34.530]  Don't know how to plant a crop.
[00:50:34.570 --> 00:50:35.732]  Don't know how to pick our nose.
[00:50:36.232 --> 00:50:39.456]  You know, I mean, we expect the government to send a special nose picker for us to do it.
[00:50:40.577 --> 00:50:44.040]  What is going to happen if the depression continues?
[00:50:44.841 --> 00:50:47.242]  We've already got 40 million Americans on food stamps.
[00:50:47.282 --> 00:50:48.762]  That's high-tech soup lines.
[00:50:49.503 --> 00:50:56.585]  What is going to happen when there's only 10% that are self-sufficient, and most of the rural people aren't self-sufficient.
[00:50:56.805 --> 00:50:58.826]  It's more like 5% of the country.
[00:50:59.146 --> 00:50:59.786]  What's going to happen?
[00:51:01.274 --> 00:51:01.934]  Here's a question.
[00:51:02.235 --> 00:51:08.178]  If you have a septic system, did you know that proper maintenance can save you thousands of dollars in costly and unnecessary repairs?
[00:51:08.419 --> 00:51:09.399]  The answer is simple.
[00:51:09.819 --> 00:51:13.602]  Use septic system injector treatments made specifically for your home or business.
[00:51:13.902 --> 00:51:16.684]  Available only at SimpleSepticSolutions.com.
[00:51:17.004 --> 00:51:17.905]  Made in the U.S.
[00:51:18.125 --> 00:51:23.188]  Guaranteed to reduce sludge and odor by continuously cleaning your septic system, drain pipes and leach field.
[00:51:23.428 --> 00:51:29.092]  This non-hazardous patented injector system contains billions of natural active bacteria and enzymes.
[00:51:29.372 --> 00:51:29.933]  We're good.
[00:51:44.428 --> 00:51:44.648]  I think.
[00:52:03.126 --> 00:52:04.847]  And you're subject to public police action.
[00:52:05.628 --> 00:52:06.568]  Tyranny is here.
[00:52:06.888 --> 00:52:10.490]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:52:10.610 --> 00:52:13.031]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:52:13.051 --> 00:52:18.214]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on Earth.
[00:52:18.914 --> 00:52:25.158]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:52:25.578 --> 00:52:31.142]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:52:31.562 --> 00:52:35.265]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:52:35.745 --> 00:52:39.788]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:52:40.028 --> 00:52:42.830]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies,
[00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:45.552]  Stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:52:45.972 --> 00:52:48.954]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:52:49.514 --> 00:52:50.935]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:52:51.495 --> 00:52:51.995]  It's here.

[00:54:04.626 --> 00:54:08.067]  Dante in California, you're on the air.
[00:54:08.087 --> 00:54:08.907]  Go ahead, Dante.
[00:54:08.967 --> 00:54:21.150]  Hi Alex, I've got an article here you're going to want to write down if you still have that pen and pad ready.
[00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:22.050]  AP, Enterprise.
[00:54:32.116 --> 00:54:35.798]  Sub-attack was near U.S.-South Korea drill.
[00:54:36.038 --> 00:54:37.259]  Keyword being drill.
[00:54:37.799 --> 00:54:41.501]  And it says in this article here that two months after the sinking, U.S.
[00:54:41.541 --> 00:54:48.845]  officials for the first time disclosed details of a joint naval exercise held the same day as the attack on the Chenoweth.
[00:54:49.306 --> 00:54:56.750]  You know, Wayne Madsen, though, actually knew two weeks ago that there was a drill and that it was right in a nest of U.S.
[00:54:56.790 --> 00:54:58.411]  forces with deep-sea divers.
[00:54:58.991 --> 00:55:03.733]  And they were doing some type of torpedo drill, so the evidence is leaning towards another false flag.
[00:55:04.093 --> 00:55:07.434]  Because again, the Japanese government was about to throw U.S.
[00:55:07.474 --> 00:55:14.196]  forces out, now the Prime Minister resigned, apologized, and said, your troops stay here, please don't let North Korea get us.
[00:55:15.297 --> 00:55:17.097]  Okay, just make sure you didn't look over that.
[00:55:17.197 --> 00:55:19.818]  No, no, no, I'm glad you told me, but I mean, now they're admitting it, huh?
[00:55:20.579 --> 00:55:21.779]  What was that out of, AP?
[00:55:22.619 --> 00:55:27.201]  AP, yeah, the title was AP Enterprise sub-attack was near U.S.
[00:55:27.768 --> 00:55:28.929]  South Korea drill.
[00:55:31.231 --> 00:55:48.145]  And I wanted to see if you had a chance to see Iron Man 2, because in that movie, the whole movie is pretty much about, you know, arms dealings, but the whole movie they're talking about how Tony Stark is trying to stop weapons from being sold to North Korea and Iran.
[00:55:48.823 --> 00:55:54.265]  Those are the only two countries mentioned in the whole movie about... Well, I did... It's funny you said that.
[00:55:54.325 --> 00:56:03.809]  I did watch Iron Man last week on the treadmill in two different jugs and the entire film is Pentagon propaganda placement and you can see where it's all paid for.
[00:56:03.889 --> 00:56:07.250]  It is total mind control, start to finish.
[00:56:08.330 --> 00:56:32.910]  uh... and uh... you know pro-afghan war so of course this movie's gonna be right on time for iran and north korea it's just like they had the pearl harbor movie right before nine eleven it's all queued up it's all staged uh... and it's all part of mind control i appreciate your call now i i haven't been out of the theater of the only movies i really watch now is when i'm on the treadmill cause if i'm not watching movies i can't jog for more than twenty minutes but
[00:56:33.931 --> 00:56:35.372]  I'm watching Hurt Locker right now.
[00:56:35.432 --> 00:56:36.533]  I haven't seen the end of it yet.
[00:56:36.573 --> 00:56:37.533]  It's pretty good, actually.
[00:56:38.414 --> 00:56:39.695]  I'm going to finish jogging tonight.
[00:56:39.715 --> 00:56:40.616]  I didn't have time this morning.
[00:56:41.636 --> 00:56:44.618]  I was on Coast to Coast last night, so I had to get some shut-eye this morning.
[00:56:44.918 --> 00:56:45.739]  Couldn't get up too early.
[00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:47.460]  Mindless trivia.
[00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:48.101]  Why does that matter?
[00:56:48.741 --> 00:56:50.882]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ted.
[00:56:50.902 --> 00:56:52.243]  Alright, let's talk to Ted.
[00:56:52.483 --> 00:56:53.584]  Quincy in California.
[00:56:53.624 --> 00:56:54.105]  You're on the air.
[00:57:04.417 --> 00:57:05.218]  Say that again?
[00:57:35.087 --> 00:57:39.250]  Could BP might have actually struck a mud volcano?
[00:57:41.832 --> 00:57:58.205]  Oh, well I mean they do have underwater volcanoes, but there's more volcanoes because the Earth's 75% covered by the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and Arctic Oceans and other oceans, the seven seas.
[00:57:58.245 --> 00:58:01.948]  The point is that yes, they do have these big vents
[00:58:02.728 --> 00:58:10.272]  Uh, that do eject, uh, mud and oil and chemicals, uh, toxic, uh, compounds out of volcanoes.
[00:58:10.532 --> 00:58:11.453]  That's another great point.
[00:58:11.813 --> 00:58:25.760]  I mean, this, uh, they need to plug it, it is a problem, but them shutting down the beaches, shutting down the fishing, uh, and using toxic chemicals to disperse it is far worse than the oil itself.
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:27.341]  From all the evidence I've seen.
[00:58:27.361 --> 00:58:28.362]  That's a really great point.
[00:58:29.182 --> 00:58:30.683]  And I appreciate your call, Quincy.
[00:58:31.184 --> 00:58:31.784]  We'll come back.
[00:58:31.804 --> 00:58:32.785]  I'll do five more minutes.
[00:58:33.185 --> 00:58:35.107]  And then we've got Paul Joseph Watson coming up.
[00:58:35.167 --> 00:58:39.390]  He's gonna go over the entire BP operation in great detail.
[00:58:41.291 --> 00:58:46.215]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:58:46.895 --> 00:58:50.098]  We are the GCN Radio Network.

[01:00:17.213 --> 01:00:20.354]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Paul Joseph Watson coming up in about eight minutes.
[01:00:20.854 --> 01:00:25.535]  If you go to the CNBC website, you can read the quotes by The Economist.
[01:00:25.675 --> 01:00:27.716]  It's not actually in that shorter video clip.
[01:00:27.916 --> 01:00:29.036]  We're trying to find a longer one.
[01:00:29.396 --> 01:00:31.177]  Investment banker, it's going to get nasty.
[01:00:31.237 --> 01:00:33.878]  Buy land, barbed wire, and guns.
[01:00:34.278 --> 01:00:37.519]  Gold climbs a new record as double-dip recession talk grows.
[01:00:38.099 --> 01:00:40.279]  And, of course, Bloomberg reporting since the weekend, U.S.
[01:00:40.299 --> 01:00:40.920]  $13 trillion debt.
[01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:47.541]  Yeah, I want to talk about the BP incident.
[01:00:47.561 --> 01:00:51.442]  And my thing is, since it happened, they quit talking about the explosions that happened.
[01:00:51.462 --> 01:00:53.903]  They haven't mentioned anything else about that.
[01:00:53.923 --> 01:00:56.544]  It's been like a shadow over it in the media.
[01:00:56.564 --> 01:00:57.964]  But to me, it just seems like
[01:01:12.819 --> 01:01:22.963]  The Gulf Coast is a great place for them to experiment or to start their dominance in this country of the takeover that you talk about a lot.
[01:01:24.003 --> 01:01:31.907]  And I think when it gets really hot down here this summer, the gas prices are going to be affected by this.
[01:01:32.487 --> 01:01:35.528]  And I'm not saying that I know that, you know, nobody knows for sure.
[01:01:36.317 --> 01:01:46.121]  But I think that's part of the plan, and it may be part of finally collapsing the dollar, because, you know, when you've seen in the past eight years, when we've had the hurricane seasons, it's really bad.
[01:01:46.161 --> 01:01:49.803]  You have three or four hurricanes come, you know, and hit the Gulf Coast.
[01:01:50.804 --> 01:01:53.945]  You see these gas shortages happening, you know, people standing in line.
[01:01:54.585 --> 01:01:58.267]  I think that it's going to be, you know, three times as worse.
[01:01:59.289 --> 01:02:00.089]  At least by August.
[01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:01.070]  It's going to be really bad.
[01:02:14.497 --> 01:02:16.898]  And that's where the real investigation should be focused.
[01:02:17.298 --> 01:02:19.920]  That could be the cover for the false flag event.
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:26.303]  And Watson, Steve Watson, Paul Watson and myself put an article together that boils all of this down.
[01:02:26.643 --> 01:02:37.189]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com and Paul Watson is going to walk through that and he may even take some calls, probably will after the half hour point after he's covered it, specifically on the oil spill.
[01:02:38.389 --> 01:02:41.951]  In fact, I've tried to get to all the calls that were on the board, but we're not going to be successful at that.
[01:02:41.991 --> 01:02:50.394]  But I'll have John up at the network go through Donna, Chris, Mysterious, and other callers.
[01:02:50.414 --> 01:02:54.756]  Why don't you just call yourself Frankenberry or something?
[01:02:54.796 --> 01:02:55.776]  I don't know.
[01:02:55.856 --> 01:02:56.637]  Mysterious.
[01:02:57.517 --> 01:02:58.137]  Tweedledee.
[01:02:58.317 --> 01:02:58.577]  Whatever.
[01:02:58.597 --> 01:02:59.498]  I'm going to stop being stupid.
[01:03:00.398 --> 01:03:00.958]  Keebler!
[01:03:02.359 --> 01:03:04.200]  Just give yourself some type of fanciful name.
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.184]  We'll say the caller from California is Matt Ryan.
[01:03:07.204 --> 01:03:07.905]  How does that sound?
[01:03:07.945 --> 01:03:09.568]  We'll say that's secretly Matt Ryan calling in.
[01:03:09.848 --> 01:03:11.290]  No, no, to be totally serious here, um...
[01:03:15.657 --> 01:03:15.917]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:17.398 --> 01:03:19.399]  Watson, come up at the bottom of the hour if he covers the news.
[01:03:19.679 --> 01:03:25.800]  He'll take a few calls on the Gulf oil spill to get your take on that.
[01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:30.642]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us here live on air.
[01:03:31.262 --> 01:03:33.423]  There's another big report up on Drudge.
[01:03:33.443 --> 01:03:37.764]  74% oppose taxing internet news sites to help newspapers.
[01:03:38.144 --> 01:03:40.165]  That's been proposed by the Federal Trade Commission.
[01:03:40.785 --> 01:03:42.386]  And there's a poll out, there's an article by
[01:03:43.786 --> 01:03:46.188]  Rasmussen polls are dealing with this.
[01:03:46.968 --> 01:03:57.795]  I'm ashamed that 26% of people that were polled would want to take money from people that have websites and give it to the fat cat, corrupt, lying newspapers.
[01:03:58.456 --> 01:03:59.276]  But again, you got 26%.
[01:03:59.396 --> 01:04:02.538]  I bet those are government workers and bureaucrat types.
[01:04:03.779 --> 01:04:05.500]  That's about who works for the government now.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:08.461]  Of course, 95% of new job growth is in the government sector.
[01:04:08.481 --> 01:04:13.263]  And I'm not saying we don't need some government, but come on folks, the whole country's collapsing.
[01:04:13.503 --> 01:04:15.644]  We're not going to have any jobs if this doesn't stop.
[01:04:16.384 --> 01:04:22.827]  But if you go to PrisonPlanet.com, you can read the top story that's just gone up in the last hour.
[01:04:22.987 --> 01:04:25.488]  Evidence points to BP oil spill, false
[01:04:26.068 --> 01:04:26.808]  I think so.
[01:04:41.314 --> 01:04:42.635]  Yeah, they're trying to block us there.
[01:04:42.915 --> 01:04:47.577]  We might just let them block us, because maybe they'll just throw a fit and shut the whole web down if we don't submit to them.
[01:04:47.897 --> 01:04:49.098]  No, folks, we've got to fight back.
[01:04:49.358 --> 01:04:50.359]  Great job to the crew.
[01:04:50.659 --> 01:04:51.519]  I'm going to bow out.
[01:04:51.779 --> 01:04:55.981]  Paul Watson, he's coming up for the last 58 minutes of Transmission.
[01:04:56.522 --> 01:05:00.324]  Don't forget the online video bookstore to support us and get key material at infowars.com.
[01:05:01.184 --> 01:05:03.806]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:05:04.206 --> 01:05:09.169]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:05:09.529 --> 01:05:11.270]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:05:11.591 --> 01:05:16.394]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:05:16.574 --> 01:05:17.554]  How much do you want?
[01:05:17.774 --> 01:05:18.495]  When do you want it?
[01:05:18.875 --> 01:05:20.477]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:05:20.758 --> 01:05:21.599]  When will you need it?
[01:05:21.839 --> 01:05:23.902]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:05:24.042 --> 01:05:25.144]  Will there be any food?
[01:05:25.384 --> 01:05:26.726]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:05:26.906 --> 01:05:31.973]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:05:32.173 --> 01:05:35.318]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:05:35.758 --> 01:05:39.260]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:05:39.581 --> 01:05:40.561]  How much will you need?
[01:05:40.802 --> 01:05:41.422]  We don't know.
[01:05:41.702 --> 01:05:42.603]  How much do you want?
[01:05:42.803 --> 01:05:43.543]  All you can get.
[01:05:43.743 --> 01:05:44.584]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:44.824 --> 01:05:47.606]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:05:47.886 --> 01:05:49.647]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:05:49.667 --> 01:05:50.588]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:06:02.062 --> 01:06:05.685]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:06.025 --> 01:06:14.152]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:06:14.892 --> 01:06:18.915]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:06:19.516 --> 01:06:30.345]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:06:30.945 --> 01:06:39.948]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:40.468 --> 01:06:45.530]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:06:45.890 --> 01:06:53.073]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:53.393 --> 01:06:56.134]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:06:59.977 --> 01:07:04.200]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:05.121]  Number 1.
[01:07:05.441 --> 01:07:08.584]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:08.864 --> 01:07:09.424]  Number 2.
[01:07:09.725 --> 01:07:14.268]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.608 --> 01:07:15.049]  It's true.
[01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:19.912]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:20.233 --> 01:07:20.773]  Number 3.
[01:07:21.053 --> 01:07:24.336]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.636 --> 01:07:28.339]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.539 --> 01:07:31.700]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:35.481]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:35.781 --> 01:07:40.482]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.702 --> 01:07:45.464]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:45.764 --> 01:07:49.785]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:49.925 --> 01:07:51.486]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:51.706 --> 01:07:56.547]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call one
[01:08:02.653 --> 01:08:08.679]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:12.263]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.315 --> 01:08:19.276]  It's Tuesday, June 8th, 2010.
[01:08:19.316 --> 01:08:22.998]  This is the final hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:23.458 --> 01:08:25.119]  My name is Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:08:25.599 --> 01:08:35.704]  I'm the editor and writer at PrisonPlanet.com, and I'll be sitting in for the last 60 minutes on today's broadcast, as I did yesterday.
[01:08:36.604 --> 01:08:45.649]  Of course, we have Kurt Nimmo over at Infowars.com, and Steve Watson, who is the writer and editor at Infowars.net, as well as
[01:08:46.309 --> 01:08:47.390]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:48.290 --> 01:09:01.236]  Now, Alex has been discussing the BP oil spill throughout the length of the broadcast, and within the last hour we've just published a report on this at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:09:03.098 --> 01:09:24.009]  And, um, there are a number of disturbing, suspicious, and revealing pieces of evidence that, as Alex talks about in the past three hours, strongly indicate that not only was there foreknowledge of the, um, explosion, um, but the so-called accident may indeed have been deliberate.
[01:09:25.086 --> 01:09:33.030]  Now what we've seen over the past several days is, and especially today, this fake grandstanding by Obama.
[01:09:33.190 --> 01:09:42.075]  He's going to, quote, kick ass and deal with the culprits of whoever was behind and whoever was responsible for the oil spill.
[01:09:42.916 --> 01:09:44.817]  And basically I'm just not buying it.
[01:09:45.057 --> 01:09:54.222]  I mean, Obama was anointed at the 2008 Bilderberg meeting in Chantilly, Virginia, where he met there with Hillary Clinton in this big
[01:09:54.803 --> 01:10:01.383]  Secret meeting that was built up by the media but never actually reported on the fact that it was at Bilderberg.
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:06.621]  Now, BP basically is Bilderberg.
[01:10:06.961 --> 01:10:14.183]  Every single person of influence within British Petroleum is a key Bilderberg member and regular attendee.
[01:10:14.763 --> 01:10:27.786]  People like John Brown, the former CEO, people like the Chairman, Henrik Svanberg, and of course, the current Chief Executive of BP, Tony Hayward, who was recently
[01:10:28.752 --> 01:10:33.517]  Pretty active in getting rid of his shares in BP right before the oil spill.
[01:10:33.557 --> 01:10:35.960]  That's one of the pieces of evidence we cover in the article.
[01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:49.093]  And of course, former BP chairman Peter Sutherland, who is now the chairman of Goldman Sachs, who also attended the Bilderberg meeting in Spain over this past weekend.
[01:10:50.655 --> 01:11:09.046]  This side show, this Punch and Judy show that Obama is now going after BP and after the culprits of the oil spill, I'm just not buying it because, I mean, the first thing that Obama did after this happened and after it became pretty apparent that it was a big disaster,
[01:11:09.546 --> 01:11:09.787]  I don't
[01:11:29.289 --> 01:11:31.030]  They're both Bilderberg minions.
[01:11:31.050 --> 01:11:32.231]  They're on the same team.
[01:11:33.011 --> 01:11:49.019]  And indeed, it seems like Obama's taking one for the team with his political career because there's certainly no way he's gonna go after BP because they're both together with the Bilderberg group in on this New World Order.
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:53.222]  And ultimately, the bigger this crisis gets,
[01:11:54.181 --> 01:11:59.045]  And the more the media hypes it up, the bigger the opportunity to exploit it.
[01:11:59.766 --> 01:12:17.501]  Which is, you know, exactly what people like Rahm Emanuel, Obama's top advisor, and Hillary Clinton both routinely call for is for crises to be exploited to pursue the agenda of world government, which is exactly what's happening with this BP disaster.
[01:12:18.502 --> 01:12:19.743]  And it's not just the fact that
[01:12:21.508 --> 01:12:34.717]  Halliburton, as Alex mentioned in the last segment, purchased this company to deal with, specifically this company deals with oil spill clean-ups, and Halliburton purchased it right before the explosion happened.
[01:12:35.617 --> 01:12:45.464]  It's not just the fact that Goldman Sachs, which of course is headed up now by Peter Sutherland, Bilderberger, and former BP CEO,
[01:12:46.786 --> 01:12:54.349]  Goldman Sachs dumped 44% of its shares in BP, British Petroleum, during the first quarter of this year.
[01:12:54.369 --> 01:13:06.694]  And it's not just the fact that Tony Hayward, the current BP CEO, sold £1.4 million of his shares in BP in the weeks before the disaster.
[01:13:07.895 --> 01:13:11.616]  I mean, all that suggests that there was foreknowledge, indeed.
[01:13:12.317 --> 01:13:14.878]  But the most alarming smoking gun is
[01:13:16.055 --> 01:13:25.943]  The fact that BP's own investigative report into the oil spill, on page 37, and we've got this linked up in the article on prisonplanet.com,
[01:13:27.614 --> 01:13:41.717]  Quite clearly states that, quote, undocumented modifications were made to the hydraulic system, um, that is used to seal the well in the event of an emergency, before the explosion took place.
[01:13:42.317 --> 01:13:48.619]  So BP is now claiming that they don't know who did this, when it happened, it's completely undocumented, but that
[01:13:49.299 --> 01:13:57.941]  Modifications were made to the very piece of equipment that is supposed to stop this kind of disaster from taking place.
[01:13:58.861 --> 01:14:08.744]  Now why that's not all over the news, I have no idea, because it's right there in page 37 of BP's own investigative report into the disaster.
[01:14:09.932 --> 01:14:36.310]  So not only do we have the, um, suspicious stock and share sales right before the event, um, Halliburton purchasing this oil spill clean-up company right before the event, but we have the fact that BP's own report says that unknown modifications occurred with the very equipment that's supposed to prevent this kind of disaster before the explosion took place.
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:55.933]  Now, obviously the question to ask is, if this was deliberate or if anybody had foreknowledge of it, and knew that it was about to take place in order to benefit, Qui Bono, who benefits?
[01:14:56.954 --> 01:15:01.097]  I mean, experts are now saying that this could drag on for years and years and years.
[01:15:02.278 --> 01:15:18.024]  Well, we know that Obama and the globalists who control him, who pull his strings, who anointed him at the 2008 Bilderberg meeting, which was also attended by members of British Petroleum, they want a carbon tax.
[01:15:18.965 --> 01:15:20.385]  They want a gas tax.
[01:15:21.346 --> 01:15:23.046]  They want a consumption tax.
[01:15:23.166 --> 01:15:25.027]  It all basically means the same thing.
[01:15:26.247 --> 01:15:27.448]  But they're not going to get it
[01:15:28.584 --> 01:15:46.773]  With the situation that we've got in place at the moment, certainly what would help them to get it rammed through is if the government, the federal government of the United States, nationalizes the oil companies, which we know is a stated goal of the Democrats.
[01:15:48.454 --> 01:15:55.418]  And so we've got, with the failure of Copenhagen and with the exposure of the phony global warming movement,
[01:15:57.938 --> 01:16:02.580]  After Climategate, the carbon tax has basically hit a dead end.
[01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:06.422]  But now we've got this major environmental disaster.
[01:16:08.002 --> 01:16:13.125]  Obama appears to have been asleep at the wheel in the initial stages of it.
[01:16:14.305 --> 01:16:23.329]  But now he's promising to, quote, kick ass and identify the culprits who were responsible for the mistakes that led to the, quote, accident.
[01:16:24.738 --> 01:16:34.467]  But the problem is, the culprits are his Bilderberg friends who visit the same meeting each year and get the same instructions that he does.
[01:16:35.167 --> 01:16:44.896]  So there's no way in the world Obama has any interest in prosecuting or finding the culprits behind the disaster.
[01:16:46.617 --> 01:16:51.481]  So this is all intended to provide justification
[01:16:52.481 --> 01:17:11.388]  for the agenda to nationalize oil companies which the Democrats have publicly pursued and it will open the door for a carbon tax and the longer it drags on the more intense the problem seems to be with non-stop coverage from the media who in the initial stages of this
[01:17:12.403 --> 01:17:18.669]  I mean, it was a big story, but it wasn't up there as the top story every day with endless coverage.
[01:17:19.409 --> 01:17:31.360]  I mean, every time I turn on CNN or Fox News in the last two weeks, top story has always been this BP oil spill, which is strange for a story that started
[01:17:32.742 --> 01:17:34.602]  What, now more than six weeks ago?
[01:17:34.923 --> 01:17:42.985]  There's a news cycle, and even if this is a big problem, six weeks after it occurred, it doesn't normally stay at the top of the news cycle.
[01:17:43.385 --> 01:17:56.048]  But it's being pushed back up there, because I think we're going to see very soon measures proposed to at least part-nationalise the oil companies.
[01:17:57.296 --> 01:18:26.690]  Or at least use this, exploit this crisis to further the so-called green economy and the move towards a carbon tax, a consumption tax, a gas tax that will of course completely eviscerate whatever disposable income the middle class has left after, you know, the crippling fascist austerity measures that are now being proposed
[01:18:28.210 --> 01:18:30.692]  Not only in Europe, but also in America.
[01:18:32.993 --> 01:18:48.163]  So, the articles up there at PrisonPlanet.com, we run through all the evidence, the suspicion, the indications, that not only was there foreknowledge, I don't think anyone can deny that there was some kind of foreknowledge.
[01:18:48.183 --> 01:18:53.826]  This mirrors almost entirely the aggressive selling of airline stocks before 9-11.
[01:18:54.727 --> 01:19:02.397]  Watson, I don't mean to interrupt you, but I'm out there watching and listening as you fill in on the syndicated transmission.
[01:19:03.298 --> 01:19:04.840]  And I was just reminded of Haiti.
[01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:06.882]  Hundreds of thousands dead.
[01:19:06.902 --> 01:19:08.344]  It was in the news for three weeks.
[01:19:09.105 --> 01:19:10.386]  That just happened a few months ago.
[01:19:10.466 --> 01:19:12.829]  It's now completely off the table.
[01:19:13.650 --> 01:19:13.870]  I think?
[01:19:29.259 --> 01:19:32.100]  You know, not to belittle the size of this and the importance of it.
[01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:36.022]  So clearly they are artificially hyping it to the top.
[01:19:36.342 --> 01:19:41.584]  And I think overall just as a political diversion from the global political meltdown that's happening.
[01:19:41.624 --> 01:19:44.025]  But finish up when you come back with your points.
[01:19:44.085 --> 01:19:46.286]  I just wanted to pop in and tell you you're doing a great job.
[01:19:46.626 --> 01:19:54.249]  I'm Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, sitting in in the last hour today while I sit here in the command center working on a new film.
[01:19:54.949 --> 01:19:59.533]  But the show's so informative, I'm just actually sitting here listening to Paul Watson.
[01:20:01.716 --> 01:20:03.017]  Don't answer it!
[01:20:03.593 --> 01:20:11.678]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.

[01:20:19.522 --> 01:20:23.585]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?
[01:20:23.805 --> 01:20:28.768]  Zero Debt in 90 Days gets you out of debt in 90 days, guaranteed, without a payment plan,

[01:20:54.896 --> 01:21:04.324]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:21:05.105 --> 01:21:06.046]  Tyranny is here.
[01:21:06.366 --> 01:21:10.069]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:21:10.089 --> 01:21:12.531]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:21:12.551 --> 01:21:17.996]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:21:18.397 --> 01:21:18.797]  This film
[01:21:18.797 --> 01:21:24.640]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:21:25.060 --> 01:21:30.603]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:21:31.003 --> 01:21:34.725]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:21:35.225 --> 01:21:39.287]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:21:39.507 --> 01:21:45.030]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:21:45.450 --> 01:21:48.352]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:21:48.992 --> 01:21:50.393]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:21:50.973 --> 01:21:51.473]  It's here.

[01:22:00.076 --> 01:22:02.796]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[01:22:03.036 --> 01:22:06.978]  Are we going to see economic growth, slide into a recession, or at worst, depression?
[01:22:07.178 --> 01:22:09.258]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:22:09.438 --> 01:22:14.460]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:16.361]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[01:22:16.421 --> 01:22:17.741]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[01:22:17.961 --> 01:22:19.422]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[01:22:19.442 --> 01:22:22.544]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[01:22:22.824 --> 01:22:27.867]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:22:28.207 --> 01:22:37.292]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled Ten Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.

[01:22:42.695 --> 01:22:46.038]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000 year history.

[01:22:52.141 --> 01:22:52.282]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.225 --> 01:23:02.826]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:23:03.226 --> 01:23:08.188]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:23:08.568 --> 01:23:10.288]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:23:10.608 --> 01:23:15.350]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:23:15.610 --> 01:23:16.551]  How much do you want?
[01:23:16.791 --> 01:23:17.531]  When do you want it?
[01:23:17.911 --> 01:23:19.512]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:23:19.792 --> 01:23:20.613]  When will you need it?
[01:23:20.873 --> 01:23:22.934]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:23:23.074 --> 01:23:24.175]  Will there be any food?
[01:23:24.415 --> 01:23:25.736]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:23:25.936 --> 01:23:30.999]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:23:31.199 --> 01:23:33.660]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good
[01:23:35.691 --> 01:23:36.071]  We're good!
[01:24:02.236 --> 01:24:04.980]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.904]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:14.251 --> 01:24:15.672]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[01:24:16.393 --> 01:24:18.896]  I'm filling in for Alex, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:24:19.097 --> 01:24:21.560]  Alex is working on his upcoming documentary film.
[01:24:22.375 --> 01:24:24.796]  And we're talking about the BP oil spill.
[01:24:25.577 --> 01:24:27.938]  We'll be taking some of your calls in the next segment.
[01:24:28.858 --> 01:24:43.105]  Now, we were talking about this grandstanding that's going on with Obama preparing to, quote, kick ass and root out the culprits that were behind making the, quote, mistakes that led to the oil spill.
[01:24:44.125 --> 01:24:45.907]  Now, BBC is reporting, U.S.
[01:24:47.229 --> 01:24:50.132]  tests confirm big underwater oil plumes.
[01:24:50.613 --> 01:24:57.800]  Tests have shown that underwater oil plumes are travelling dozens of miles from a leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico, the U.S.
[01:24:57.821 --> 01:24:58.581]  government says.
[01:25:00.123 --> 01:25:03.947]  And it makes reference to this interview with NBC News that Obama did.
[01:25:05.126 --> 01:25:14.793]  In which he said he would have fired British Petroleum CEO Tony Hayward over the remarks he's made about the crisis.
[01:25:15.354 --> 01:25:18.616]  Which, as I said before the break, is a complete misnomer.
[01:25:19.056 --> 01:25:25.681]  This idea that Obama is cracking down on BP is completely a fraud.
[01:25:25.721 --> 01:25:26.622]  It's a sideshow.
[01:25:27.223 --> 01:25:28.464]  Because Tony Hayward
[01:25:29.224 --> 01:25:38.347]  Peter Sutherland and the other people involved at the top with BP are all top Bilderberg attendees, as was Obama in 2008.
[01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:41.007]  There's no fight between these people.
[01:25:41.087 --> 01:25:42.988]  It's ridiculous to even suggest it.
[01:25:43.508 --> 01:25:56.192]  Which is why, for the first three or four weeks of the crisis, Obama was too busy taking two vacations and playing basketball to even care about what was going on.
[01:25:56.897 --> 01:26:00.779]  I mean, you know, Nero fiddled while Rome burned.
[01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:02.561]  That's exactly what Obama did.
[01:26:03.521 --> 01:26:07.624]  Because they only benefit from this crisis becoming bigger and bigger.
[01:26:08.284 --> 01:26:17.190]  Because it jives directly with their agenda for a carbon tax, a consumption tax, a gas tax, which will be made
[01:26:17.890 --> 01:26:26.936]  All the more easier if they're able to nationalize the oil companies, which is what the Democrats and Obama have stated is their ultimate agenda.
[01:26:27.917 --> 01:26:30.199]  So we're going to take calls on that after the break.
[01:26:31.579 --> 01:26:35.000]  And get your take on what's going on with the BP oil spill.
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:54.365]  As I mentioned, PrisonPlanet.com, in the last hour and a half, we posted a big article on this listing all the evidence suggesting that not only was there foreknowledge with all these top CEOs dumping their stocks, Goldman Sachs dumping their stocks, right before the crisis occurred,
[01:26:55.345 --> 01:27:02.752]  But there's actually evidence of deliberate tampering with the very systems that are supposed to prevent this kind of disaster.
[01:27:03.392 --> 01:27:18.085]  In BP's own official investigative report on page 37, it says that the hydraulic systems were undocumented, there were undocumented alterations with the hydraulic systems before the explosion.
[01:27:19.855 --> 01:27:43.139]  Also in the next segment, we're going to get into, just briefly because we're going to take calls mainly, but how top historians and analysts are now forecasting, and this ties into the carbon tax post-industrial revolution agenda that the globalists are pushing, how top analysts are forecasting an age of rage and how
[01:27:44.588 --> 01:27:57.291]  The austerity measures that you've seen in Greece, you've seen the reaction to them in Greece, the media don't really tell you what those austerity measures are, have provoked chaos, violence and even deaths.
[01:27:58.191 --> 01:28:04.173]  Now, those scenes are coming to the United States, they're coming to other countries in Europe.
[01:28:05.796 --> 01:28:10.578]  But what exactly are these austerity measures that the Greeks are so up in arms about?
[01:28:11.398 --> 01:28:33.927]  We're gonna get into that and we're gonna break down how, if you thought, if you thought the scenes that we saw unfold in Greece were bad, wait until what's gonna happen, not only in the UK but later on down the line in America, when these same kind of fascist austerity measures, which basically amount to nothing more than a
[01:28:34.847 --> 01:28:45.774]  Massive lowering of living standards in line with the, quote, post-industrial revolution that the globalists want to force upon the population of the West.
[01:28:46.734 --> 01:28:47.295]  You're going to see
[01:28:48.604 --> 01:29:05.638]  Really, how in jeopardy your pensions, your savings, people on welfare, you're going to see how much in jeopardy all these things are with the austerity measures that governments are planning to impose within the next...
[01:29:06.619 --> 01:29:07.280]  We're good to go.
[01:29:27.253 --> 01:29:30.735]  From the financial terrorists that caused the crisis in the first place.
[01:29:31.216 --> 01:29:35.158]  But after the break, we're going to take your calls on this and the BP oil spill.
[01:29:35.639 --> 01:29:36.299]  Stay tuned.
[01:29:36.339 --> 01:29:37.780]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:42.523]  I'm Paul Joseph.
[01:29:51.309 --> 01:29:52.209]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.710 --> 01:29:54.211]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.206 --> 01:29:57.967]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.529 --> 01:30:04.470]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:30:04.730 --> 01:30:10.773]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:30:11.133 --> 01:30:18.237]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:30:18.517 --> 01:30:23.059]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:30:32.045 --> 01:30:35.847]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:30:36.307 --> 01:30:42.471]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:30:43.052 --> 01:30:46.434]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:30:46.974 --> 01:30:54.304]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:30:54.384 --> 01:30:54.844]  Thank you!
[01:31:04.457 --> 01:31:05.378]  Tyranny is here.
[01:31:05.718 --> 01:31:09.262]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:31:09.282 --> 01:31:11.885]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:31:12.045 --> 01:31:17.331]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:31:17.751 --> 01:31:23.978]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:31:24.418 --> 01:31:29.942]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:31:30.362 --> 01:31:34.084]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:31:34.565 --> 01:31:38.587]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:31:38.847 --> 01:31:44.371]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:31:44.811 --> 01:31:47.793]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:31:48.353 --> 01:31:49.794]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:31:50.334 --> 01:31:50.775]  It's here.

[01:32:00.598 --> 01:32:06.020]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:12.002]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:32:12.382 --> 01:32:19.064]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:32:21.107 --> 01:32:23.572]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:32:23.592 --> 01:32:27.319]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:32:29.471 --> 01:32:33.473]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:32:34.194 --> 01:32:37.356]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[01:32:38.016 --> 01:32:38.857]  Others don't.
[01:32:39.257 --> 01:32:41.158]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:32:41.418 --> 01:32:42.899]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:32:43.199 --> 01:32:45.761]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:32:46.081 --> 01:32:52.345]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.

[01:32:55.407 --> 01:32:57.448]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[01:32:57.768 --> 01:32:58.649]  Others don't.
[01:33:01.277 --> 01:33:02.181]  We're good.
[01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:16.202]  In 1814, we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[01:33:16.242 --> 01:33:21.424]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[01:33:21.665 --> 01:33:24.166]  We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'.
[01:33:24.386 --> 01:33:26.787]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[01:33:26.967 --> 01:33:28.407]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:28.467 --> 01:33:30.628]  That's right, the British kept a-comin'.
[01:33:31.749 --> 01:33:39.132]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson, filling in in this final hour for Alex Jones, who is working on his documentary film.
[01:33:39.992 --> 01:33:55.501]  Now, we're talking about a BP oil spill, and, um, how the evidence now suggests that not only was there foreknowledge of the event, but that, um, there may even have been tampering, um, with the equipment that caused the oil spill, the explosion itself.
[01:33:56.241 --> 01:34:07.828]  Um, we're also gonna get into the, um, wider aspects of this post-industrial revolution that the globalists are trying to impose on the free people, specifically in the Western world.
[01:34:08.448 --> 01:34:10.269]  But now we're going to take some of your calls.
[01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:13.351]  I want to talk about the BP oil spill.
[01:34:13.511 --> 01:34:17.714]  I want to talk about Bilderberg, the austerity fascism that's coming.
[01:34:18.275 --> 01:34:22.217]  And our first caller is Donna in New Hampshire.
[01:34:22.277 --> 01:34:24.038]  Donna, you are on the air.
[01:34:24.839 --> 01:34:25.399]  Hi, Paul.
[01:34:25.419 --> 01:34:26.740]  You're doing a wonderful job.
[01:34:27.821 --> 01:34:32.004]  I just wanted to kind of touch base with, first of all, my husband is down in the Gulf.
[01:34:32.044 --> 01:34:35.366]  He's been down there ever since all of this started uprising.
[01:34:36.019 --> 01:34:45.661]  And he has been at ground zero, and he said the oil, when you go five miles west or five miles east, you didn't see anything all the way up to the shore.
[01:34:46.402 --> 01:34:55.384]  And I really think, this has been my take on it from the very beginning, that BP is falling on their sword.
[01:34:55.784 --> 01:35:02.326]  They're falling on their sword for the New World Order to implement the carbon taxes and get all this.
[01:35:05.195 --> 01:35:15.119]  Obama came in and said that there's going to be no more drilling, which would put my husband out of business, along with the fact that there's no fishing being done.
[01:35:15.419 --> 01:35:19.061]  That's ruining a billion dollar industry right there.
[01:35:19.401 --> 01:35:27.204]  What better way to shut down everything and collapse our economy, but to come in and make this look bigger than it is?
[01:35:27.624 --> 01:35:30.705]  The media has been throwing this completely out
[01:35:31.352 --> 01:35:31.772]  I don't know.
[01:35:43.274 --> 01:36:01.270]  Yeah, well, I mean, as soon as this happened, you had people like Mark Levine questioning why Obama was sending SWAT teams there, and saying that basically, you know, as you said, this represents completely the wrong response to how this should be handled.
[01:36:01.891 --> 01:36:06.054]  You mentioned the fishing that's been devastated, and it has, and we know that
[01:36:06.975 --> 01:36:13.396]  Um, the government, the federal government, the globalists, do indeed have this agenda to shut down the oil industry.
[01:36:13.776 --> 01:36:14.817]  That's what they talk about.
[01:36:14.857 --> 01:36:19.218]  That's what Barroso, the EU Commission head, talks about on a regular basis.
[01:36:19.238 --> 01:36:21.458]  That's what the post-industrial revolution is.
[01:36:21.818 --> 01:36:30.260]  It's about shutting down industry and turning our economy into this green economy, which is a complete disaster because it costs
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:33.921]  2.2 jobs for every job created.
[01:36:34.361 --> 01:36:47.004]  So they want to lower living standards, they want more unemployment, and letting this crisis rumble on, as it has done, is the perfect entree to achieving that, and I thank you for your call.
[01:36:47.724 --> 01:36:50.525]  We're going to move on now to Bill in Connecticut.
[01:36:50.585 --> 01:36:51.445]  Bill, you're on the air.
[01:36:52.825 --> 01:36:53.466]  How you doing, Paul?
[01:36:54.426 --> 01:36:55.306]  Alright, Bill, how are you?
[01:36:55.834 --> 01:36:56.435]  Real good, real good.
[01:36:56.795 --> 01:37:12.148]  Hey, I just wanted to point out that today on MSNBC, Obama is sitting there saying that he's going to fire the president of British Petroleum for his muffing up the job.
[01:37:12.208 --> 01:37:15.811]  And I find it very funny because didn't the U.S.
[01:37:15.891 --> 01:37:19.374]  government say that they were in charge of the job?
[01:37:19.655 --> 01:37:23.218]  And if that's true, then isn't Obama firing himself?
[01:37:25.862 --> 01:37:26.543]  Well, that's right.
[01:37:26.723 --> 01:37:32.970]  As I said in the last segment, Obama and BP are arm-in-arm, they're hand-in-hand.
[01:37:33.170 --> 01:37:35.733]  They're both luminaries of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:47.338]  Now the idea of Obama being able to fire somebody in a private corporation is of course completely fascist.
[01:37:47.458 --> 01:37:50.540]  They tried to have that included in the TARP package.
[01:37:50.980 --> 01:38:00.047]  In fact I think they did have language which indicated that Obama would be allowed to fire CEOs of corporations which of course
[01:38:01.388 --> 01:38:09.172]  It's completely undemocratic, it's completely anti-business, and it's not something that's ever happened before in a free America.
[01:38:10.612 --> 01:38:12.974]  But yeah, it's a punch-and-judy sideshow.
[01:38:13.034 --> 01:38:14.774]  Obama's not going to go after BP.
[01:38:15.735 --> 01:38:17.156]  He's not going to kick any ass.
[01:38:17.616 --> 01:38:29.162]  He's on the same team as them, and both Obama politically and BP are taking one for the team, and they're allowing this to get worse and worse so they can later exploit the crisis.
[01:38:31.636 --> 01:38:44.285]  You know, pertaining to Chris Matthews' show coming up on the 16th there, I thought that everybody should use this as an opportunity, okay, to make lemonade out of lemons.
[01:38:44.345 --> 01:38:56.614]  So if Chris Matthews is going to be handing out lemons for the Tea Party and specifically to Alex Jones, you know, I really think that we ought to have a viewing party across the United States
[01:38:57.376 --> 01:39:13.133]  of all the tea partiers and so on and so forth to go ahead and have a good laugh because we know that these guys are trying to expose people that are exposing them to what's really going on so I thought that would be another great thing to probably do.
[01:39:14.858 --> 01:39:15.758]  That's a good idea.
[01:39:15.778 --> 01:39:28.502]  I mean, the thing about Chris Matthews and this, you know, rise of the right is basically going to be a smear attack on Alex Jones and everybody who is trying to expose this globalist takeover.
[01:39:28.603 --> 01:39:32.764]  And it's coming up, I believe, in the next few days or early next week.
[01:39:33.684 --> 01:39:38.726]  I mean, Chris Matthews says that his hero is Saul Alinsky, you know, the big commie.
[01:39:39.775 --> 01:39:41.096]  The rise of the right.
[01:39:41.236 --> 01:39:49.124]  I mean, if your hero is Saul Alinsky, then everybody on the political spectrum is going to be to the right of you.
[01:39:49.504 --> 01:39:50.445]  It's ridiculous.
[01:39:51.025 --> 01:39:55.309]  Alex Jones spent eight years bashing Bush.
[01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:58.171]  And he's this right-wing extremist.
[01:39:58.511 --> 01:40:01.832]  I mean, they're hoping that people have quite short memories there.
[01:40:02.852 --> 01:40:06.494]  And of course, it's trying to portray us as radicals.
[01:40:06.554 --> 01:40:13.456]  It ties in with the Mayak Report, trying to smear us all as domestic terrorists when we've been nothing but peaceful.
[01:40:14.236 --> 01:40:18.438]  They did the same thing with the 9-11 Truth Movement, trying to say they were dangerous.
[01:40:19.358 --> 01:40:20.759]  Completely failed again.
[01:40:21.379 --> 01:40:39.529]  So, it's gonna be interesting what kind of tactic they, uh, what kind of angle they approach this at, but it's probably gonna be the same tired, old cliches about how, where this, uh, frontier of dangerous extremism, uh, when all we're doing is telling the truth and trying to wake up people to what's happening.
[01:40:39.949 --> 01:40:41.030]  I thank you for your call.
[01:40:41.450 --> 01:40:44.432]  And now we're gonna go to, uh, Henry in Michigan.
[01:40:44.612 --> 01:40:46.053]  Henry, you are on the air.
[01:40:46.073 --> 01:40:48.614]  Hey Walter, how you doing?
[01:40:49.699 --> 01:40:50.979]  All right, Henry, what's on your mind?
[01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:52.620]  Well, hey, I'll tell you.
[01:40:52.900 --> 01:41:17.707]  I don't know if anybody else has seen this, but on the 21st, the day after this explosion, they had a survivalist that said that prior to the explosion, the BP project manager, I'm assuming, had a big meeting with all the BP higher echelons of the
[01:41:18.703 --> 01:41:21.865]  The contractor that built the rig.
[01:41:22.926 --> 01:41:35.254]  And they knew perfectly well beforehand that the check valve down below was faulty and the seals were broken and everything else.
[01:41:35.314 --> 01:41:40.157]  And this kid came out on TV and spread the beans.
[01:41:41.038 --> 01:41:44.360]  Well, since then I haven't heard one thing about
[01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:48.543]  Never have seen this guy again on TV, the survivalist.
[01:41:48.663 --> 01:41:53.467]  But he spilled his guts out saying that BP was perfectly aware of the whole situation.
[01:41:54.808 --> 01:41:57.410]  And something else... Go ahead.
[01:41:58.691 --> 01:42:06.317]  And something else that really puzzles me about this whole situation is, you know, I've been a pipe fitter, an industrial pipe fitter, for 42 years.
[01:42:07.018 --> 01:42:11.001]  And I'm watching these stupid clowns, you know, trying to cut this pipe down there.
[01:42:11.581 --> 01:42:14.524]  Granted, it is quite a depth down.
[01:42:15.259 --> 01:42:19.763]  But to cap that well would be a simple thing.
[01:42:19.783 --> 01:42:29.870]  I mean, you stick in a blow-up plug, you shoot it full of gas, and you fill it full of hydronic cement, and it's capped.
[01:42:30.111 --> 01:42:40.619]  And I feel that the reason that BP is negligent in capping this thing is that once it's capped, the well is dead.
[01:42:41.835 --> 01:42:50.159]  And it all boils down to the greed and money thing, and plus they're trying to, for some reason, it seems to me they're trying to kill the Gulf.
[01:42:51.300 --> 01:43:03.246]  And to raise the gas prices, to bring in their new world order regime, and just make hell on earth here for us.
[01:43:07.413 --> 01:43:21.178]  The point you raise that BP is probably trying to not stop the leak because it would shut down the well entirely, that's a charge that's come up quite often, that their agenda is to restart the well.
[01:43:22.899 --> 01:43:31.903]  So if they did shut it down entirely, I mean there's been talk of nuking it, that would obviously terminate it entirely, then they would lose a lot of money.
[01:43:32.383 --> 01:43:34.804]  But I mean, as you also talked about earlier,
[01:43:36.184 --> 01:43:59.591]  Um, the, the actual device, the hydraulic control system that's supposed to prevent this kind of disaster from happening, in BP's own investigative report, and I suggest, uh, you read it, we link to it in the article that we've posted on Prison Planet, very interesting, on page 37 it says that they, quote, identified undocumented modifications to the hydraulic control system.
[01:44:00.051 --> 01:44:03.032]  The extent of these modifications is unknown at this time.
[01:44:03.372 --> 01:44:04.533]  So they knew that something
[01:44:05.413 --> 01:44:06.013]  Hey, cheers Watson.
[01:44:06.033 --> 01:44:06.374]  Hi Stuart.
[01:44:35.933 --> 01:44:37.234]  What's on your mind today, Stuart?
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:45:03.725]  What are the odds of lightning igniting and ending up with some real biblical-type weather, like fire raining from the sky?
[01:45:03.745 --> 01:45:05.046]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:45:05.086 --> 01:45:08.148]  Like, what happens if you get the perfect storm down there?
[01:45:08.168 --> 01:45:11.390]  I mean, I know a hurricane's probably going to disperse it all over the South.
[01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:12.891]  I mean, it's probably going to get everywhere.
[01:45:12.931 --> 01:45:13.712]  But what happens?
[01:45:14.452 --> 01:45:21.517]  Is it possible for lightning to ignite that while it's in the atmosphere and ending up with just some real horrific
[01:45:22.378 --> 01:45:25.859]  You know, like, basically, like I said, fire raining down from the sky.
[01:45:25.879 --> 01:45:34.962]  I don't know if you know much about that either, but I want to put that out there because, you know, he raised that point and I was just kind of, I was like, whoa, you know what I mean?
[01:45:35.022 --> 01:45:45.064]  So if somebody who does know about that kind of stuff could look into it or call up or if someone could look into it would be great because I think people should know that that's a possibility.
[01:45:45.425 --> 01:45:46.745]  And that's all I want to say.
[01:45:48.226 --> 01:45:48.867]  Alright, thanks.
[01:45:48.907 --> 01:46:01.078]  Yeah, I don't know much about it personally, but certainly on the issue of the hurricanes, I mean, we saw with Katrina they used that as an excuse to get the troops in and conduct the disarmament procedure.
[01:46:01.098 --> 01:46:03.099]  And now, troops
[01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:12.564]  According to reports, we're going to be heading there, you know, to deal with the crisis of the oil spill, so we're going to have to watch that very carefully.
[01:46:13.724 --> 01:46:14.985]  Thanks for the call, Stuart.
[01:46:15.165 --> 01:46:18.986]  And now we're going to go to John in North Carolina.
[01:46:19.046 --> 01:46:20.507]  John, you are on the air.
[01:46:21.167 --> 01:46:21.668]  Hey, Paul.
[01:46:21.708 --> 01:46:22.748]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:46:24.209 --> 01:46:29.851]  About the oil situation, I know there's a large variety of
[01:46:30.433 --> 01:46:32.914]  A point people have made, and it's tough to say really.
[01:46:33.335 --> 01:46:36.216]  That's my perspective right now, what the nature of it is.
[01:46:36.636 --> 01:46:42.580]  I think what we know is that the response was very lackluster, very slow, and is still very slow and lackluster.
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:48.663]  And it certainly seems like they're trying to let the fire keep burning and not try to put it out.
[01:46:48.683 --> 01:46:52.325]  I think we could make that determination, don't you think?
[01:46:54.025 --> 01:47:00.167]  Yeah, and what's amazing to me is, you know this oil spill camera that we're constantly seeing?
[01:47:00.287 --> 01:47:04.168]  I mean, you can barely open up a news website without seeing it now.
[01:47:04.568 --> 01:47:12.770]  Turn on Fox News or CNN, and this oil spill camera shows you second-by-second progress of how much is spilling out.
[01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:15.531]  And that was set up by BP.
[01:47:16.351 --> 01:47:29.284]  So you think that, you know, if they're buying Google searches, which they are, then why have they set up this oil spill camera that constantly reminds people of how bad this disaster is second by second?
[01:47:29.604 --> 01:47:31.626]  So that's also something that baffled me.
[01:47:32.047 --> 01:47:38.513]  It does seem there's an attempt to hype this, and I mean, obviously it's a devastating crisis, but
[01:47:39.894 --> 01:47:59.632]  At some level, BP seem to be involved in hyping the crisis, which is very odd, unless you consider the fact that they might be trying to hype it to the extent where massive, quote, solutions need to be called for, which obviously lead to nationalisation and
[01:48:00.413 --> 01:48:00.473]  Yes.
[01:48:00.493 --> 01:48:00.973]  MI6KEYMISE.
[01:48:00.993 --> 01:48:01.273]  Okay.
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:25.881]  Thanks for the call.
[01:48:27.482 --> 01:48:29.584]  Mike in Wyoming, you are on the air.
[01:48:29.784 --> 01:48:30.264]  Welcome.
[01:48:30.885 --> 01:48:31.905]  Yes, thanks Paul.
[01:48:33.467 --> 01:48:51.421]  The other day I saw an article of yours that suggested that treaties overriding even the Constitution itself were problematic or were a matter of debate and I just wanted to lay that one to rest.
[01:48:52.501 --> 01:48:52.802]  Treaties
[01:48:53.798 --> 01:48:58.161]  necessarily fall underneath the Constitution and over statute law.
[01:48:59.562 --> 01:49:03.705]  Otherwise, you could use treaties to simply unravel the Constitution itself.
[01:49:04.326 --> 01:49:07.088]  And the founders weighed in on that.
[01:49:07.128 --> 01:49:18.176]  They were very explicit that treaties did not sit at the same level in terms of their legal status as the Constitution.
[01:49:20.319 --> 01:49:30.888]  Yeah, that was an article about this UN small arms treaty which Bilderberg is apparently trying to use as an end run around the Second Amendment.
[01:49:31.788 --> 01:49:39.155]  And I basically wrote that, you know, the notion that a treaty trumps the Constitution is a murky area of debate.
[01:49:39.955 --> 01:49:44.898]  Um, from what I read, um, any such treaty needs Senate approval.
[01:49:45.519 --> 01:49:51.303]  Um, but there have been examples in the past where, um, it can override the Constitution.
[01:49:51.323 --> 01:49:52.604]  I'm not saying that's right.
[01:49:53.004 --> 01:50:00.589]  Basically the point I was making was that, um, this is what the federal government will claim if they try to push this through.
[01:50:00.609 --> 01:50:01.730]  Um, so...
[01:50:02.330 --> 01:50:03.011]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:50:03.051 --> 01:50:20.223]  I mean, it's completely illegal for it to happen, but this is what they will claim if they try to get something through like the small arm street and then use it against American citizens, that it overrides the Constitution, when obviously it doesn't, because it's not been approved by Congress or the Senate.
[01:50:21.344 --> 01:50:22.565]  Thanks for the call, Mike.
[01:50:22.965 --> 01:50:25.667]  And the next caller is Diane in Florida.
[01:50:25.827 --> 01:50:26.828]  Diane, you are on the air.
[01:50:27.915 --> 01:50:34.517]  Hi, I just wanted to relay some information I heard on FiltoGain, which is out of Sarasota, Florida.
[01:50:34.537 --> 01:50:35.438]  This is last week.
[01:50:36.158 --> 01:50:44.461]  And Goldman Sachs shorted BP 4.6 million shares two days before the oil spill.
[01:50:45.041 --> 01:50:45.722]  What a coincidence.
[01:50:45.742 --> 01:50:48.163]  Yeah, that's right, and it's in the article.
[01:50:48.803 --> 01:50:50.123]  We'll be back after the break.
[01:50:50.503 --> 01:50:51.924]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:52.044 --> 01:50:53.284]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:50:53.685 --> 01:50:55.665]  Stay tuned for the final segment.
[01:50:55.685 --> 01:50:57.066]  We'll be back in a few minutes.
[01:51:01.388 --> 01:51:04.932]  I'm concerned about food for my family in the event of an emergency.
[01:51:05.292 --> 01:51:06.714]  And I know you are too.

[01:52:01.451 --> 01:52:06.313]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:52:06.413 --> 01:52:07.193]  What have we got?
[01:52:07.413 --> 01:52:09.534]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:52:09.854 --> 01:52:10.594]  A republic.
[01:52:10.854 --> 01:52:13.435]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:52:13.515 --> 01:52:17.676]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:52:17.796 --> 01:52:23.158]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[01:52:23.358 --> 01:52:26.999]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:52:27.364 --> 01:52:31.025]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:52:31.065 --> 01:52:32.045]  You have been warned!
[01:52:32.325 --> 01:52:33.166]  We have the facts.
[01:52:33.366 --> 01:52:34.486]  We have the Constitution.
[01:52:34.526 --> 01:52:35.406]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:52:35.426 --> 01:52:36.266]  We have common law.
[01:52:36.327 --> 01:52:38.567]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:52:38.847 --> 01:52:41.548]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[01:52:41.788 --> 01:52:42.648]  Rise of the Republic.
[01:52:42.728 --> 01:52:47.510]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:52:47.690 --> 01:52:49.050]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:52:49.190 --> 01:52:50.030]  Don't Tread on Me.

[01:53:02.056 --> 01:53:02.376]  Fact.
[01:53:02.636 --> 01:53:03.957]  Four million people in the U.S.
[01:53:03.997 --> 01:53:05.798]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[01:53:06.118 --> 01:53:06.438]  Fact.
[01:53:06.638 --> 01:53:10.000]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the eighth leading cause of death among Americans.
[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:10.640]  Fact.
[01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:16.263]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[01:53:16.443 --> 01:53:16.723]  Fact.
[01:53:17.143 --> 01:53:20.927]  1 in 10 Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[01:53:21.267 --> 01:53:21.607]  Fact!
[01:53:21.847 --> 01:53:25.611]  Anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[01:54:03.476 --> 01:54:06.959]  I think a parasitic dream will never come back.
[01:54:07.019 --> 01:54:11.624]  It painted my hands and my face blue.
[01:54:11.944 --> 01:54:16.709]  And suddenly the fast wind took me away.
[01:54:16.849 --> 01:54:21.193]  And made me fly in the infinite sky.
[01:54:30.718 --> 01:54:33.399]  It's the Alex Jones Show, final segment.
[01:54:33.899 --> 01:54:39.842]  Now, we didn't get time to get into this, but we keep hearing about these austerity measures.
[01:54:39.942 --> 01:54:45.264]  We keep seeing the riots in Greece and hear people talking about them coming to America.
[01:54:46.085 --> 01:54:48.686]  But what exactly are these austerity measures?
[01:54:49.326 --> 01:54:50.947]  How will they affect us?
[01:54:51.247 --> 01:54:57.290]  How will they affect our savings, our income, our taxes, our pensions, our public services?
[01:54:58.270 --> 01:55:13.439]  We've got an article coming up at PrisonPlanet.com which delves into this and clarifies exactly why there are massive riots coming to Europe and eventually America over the next two or three years.
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:16.121]  And this article explains exactly why.
[01:55:16.141 --> 01:55:24.466]  In these final few minutes, we're going to go to our final couple of callers and the next one is Sonny in Ohio.
[01:55:24.606 --> 01:55:25.607]  Sonny, you are on the air.
[01:55:31.081 --> 01:55:31.901]  Sunny dropped off.
[01:55:32.842 --> 01:55:36.124]  Okay, we'll go to Teresa in California.
[01:55:36.204 --> 01:55:37.504]  Teresa, you're on the air.
[01:55:38.505 --> 01:55:39.385]  Thank you, thank you.
[01:55:40.006 --> 01:55:46.969]  Yes, I know that, based on what I've understood, that the 1% elite own the entire world.
[01:55:47.590 --> 01:55:52.432]  And are we supposed to arm ourselves with the ammunition and guns and barricade ourselves in our homes?
[01:55:53.333 --> 01:55:56.874]  I want to ask you one more thing, if I may, please, or just make a statement.
[01:55:58.157 --> 01:56:00.982]  They say that conspiracy theory is bogus.
[01:56:01.443 --> 01:56:08.395]  Well, if you look at Gerald Salente, Max Keiser, Bob Chapman, they all follow suit with the understanding of Alex Jones.
[01:56:10.742 --> 01:56:23.878]  No, I mean, the thing that shocks me is you've got people with $200 haircuts and fancy suits on CNBC saying exactly the same things as Max Keiser, Gerald Solente and Alex Jones.
[01:56:24.298 --> 01:56:27.863]  So when it gets to that stage, it stops being a conspiracy theory.
[01:56:28.263 --> 01:56:31.026]  I mean, take for example the article I wrote this morning.
[01:56:31.767 --> 01:56:34.670]  Investment banker, it's going to get nasty.
[01:56:35.071 --> 01:56:37.594]  Buy land, barbed wire and guns.
[01:56:38.054 --> 01:56:41.919]  And this was a guy on CNBC saying this, saying that basically,
[01:56:43.340 --> 01:56:57.006]  You better stock up on gold, guns and land, because the markets are going south, the turmoil is only going to get worse, and there are going to be riots, and that's exactly what Kaiser, Salenti and Alex Jones have been saying for years.
[01:56:57.386 --> 01:57:04.969]  So, I mean, it's gone beyond claiming that this is a conspiracy theory put out by paranoid, insane people.
[01:57:05.009 --> 01:57:05.629]  That's dead.
[01:57:05.649 --> 01:57:07.350]  That was five years ago.
[01:57:08.050 --> 01:57:08.791]  Now we're in it.
[01:57:09.031 --> 01:57:11.192]  It's manifestly provable and it's happening.
[01:57:12.052 --> 01:57:19.596]  Um, so, you know, on the face of it, it's an open conspiracy, as we've emphasized many times, so there's no longer any denial.
[01:57:20.617 --> 01:57:22.478]  Uh, we're gonna try Sonny again.
[01:57:22.498 --> 01:57:24.799]  Uh, Sonny in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:57:24.819 --> 01:57:28.041]  Hey, good show today there, Paul.
[01:57:29.202 --> 01:57:30.483]  Okay, Sonny, what's on your mind?
[01:57:31.103 --> 01:57:38.567]  Well, I just wanted to tell you, when you were talking about why they're showing the second-by-second thing of the camera footage, it's the watch the train wreck scenario.
[01:57:38.627 --> 01:57:39.248]  That's what it is.
[01:57:39.328 --> 01:57:40.028]  It's a complete
[01:57:40.618 --> 01:57:41.719]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:08.970]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:58:09.011 --> 01:58:14.075]  It's a distraction, and the fact that BP put it out there, I mean, shows that entirely.
[01:58:15.055 --> 01:58:16.317]  But we've come to the end of the show.
[01:58:16.417 --> 01:58:17.918]  Sorry to Janice in Texas.
[01:58:18.258 --> 01:58:21.020]  If you call back tomorrow, you'll be able to get on the air.
[01:58:21.721 --> 01:58:29.327]  And we've got this big austerity fascism article coming out at PrisonPlanet.com, so be sure to visit the websites and read that.
[01:58:29.868 --> 01:58:31.009]  I'll be back on Monday.
[01:58:31.089 --> 01:58:32.270]  Alex will be back tomorrow.
[01:58:32.650 --> 01:58:35.953]  Stay tuned for the rebroadcast, which is coming up in a couple of minutes.
[01:58:36.173 --> 01:58:37.354]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
