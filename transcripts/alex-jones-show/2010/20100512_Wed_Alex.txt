[00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:06.521]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.521 --> 00:00:08.283]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.283 --> 00:00:10.066]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.648]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.648 --> 00:00:13.190]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.396]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.396 --> 00:00:21.461]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.362 --> 00:00:25.364]  We have reached the halfway point in this Friday edition.
[00:00:25.364 --> 00:00:36.992]  For the next 60 minutes, James Traficant is our guest, the iconic, beam-me-up Scotty, there's no intelligent life here, Congressman, who was absolutely railroaded into prison.
[00:00:36.992 --> 00:00:42.776]  There is no doubt about that for exposing corruption and tyranny in this nation.
[00:00:43.556 --> 00:00:55.764]  And he's going to discuss the Tea Parties, he's running for the Congress again, we're going to get his take on the militarization of police, what really happened in Oklahoma City, he investigated that, what happened with the Pan Am flight, and a lot more.
[00:00:55.764 --> 00:01:01.188]  And we'll take some phone calls, because I did have the phones open earlier for military and police to call in.
[00:01:01.188 --> 00:01:09.234]  We have all these government documents where they're training the military for martial law in America, and it's building towards a crescendo.
[00:01:09.234 --> 00:01:10.975]  James Traficant, good to have you on with us, sir.
[00:01:11.315 --> 00:01:12.517]  Glad to be back, Alex.
[00:01:12.517 --> 00:01:19.705]  And I want to say, after appearing on your show several months ago, I didn't realize how strong a show you have.
[00:01:19.705 --> 00:01:23.991]  And I want to commend you, because you are educating millions of American people.
[00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:28.376]  I was surprised, and I'm honored to be asked to come back on your show.
[00:01:28.536 --> 00:01:32.777]  Well, Congressman, we're honored to have you here because of your courage and your steadfastness.
[00:01:32.777 --> 00:01:34.317]  So much is happening, so much is going on.
[00:01:34.317 --> 00:01:47.861]  I've got questions and issues I want to pick your brain about, but out of the gates, the state of the union, the state of the taxing system, all the new VAT taxes they want, telling us austerity, taxes are going to go up, our benefits are going to go down.
[00:01:47.861 --> 00:01:49.461]  What does James Traficant say about that?
[00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:51.782]  Well, number one, I think the country is bankrupt.
[00:01:51.782 --> 00:01:52.863]  That's evident.
[00:01:52.863 --> 00:01:57.967]  And number two, I think all they're talking about doing is just going to further implode this nation.
[00:01:57.967 --> 00:02:00.368]  And I see us dismantling like the old Soviet Union.
[00:02:00.368 --> 00:02:01.729]  I really do, Alex.
[00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.372]  I think that you can't continue to have the income tax that penalizes work.
[00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:09.093]  Subsidizes illegitimacy and rewards dependency.
[00:02:09.093 --> 00:02:10.474]  It's time to throw it out.
[00:02:10.474 --> 00:02:11.714]  Abolish the IRS.
[00:02:11.714 --> 00:02:13.295]  Repeal the 16th Amendment.
[00:02:13.295 --> 00:02:19.177]  Now, you know, I support a flat, fair 25% consumption tax on final retail sales.
[00:02:19.177 --> 00:02:21.698]  Now, my opponents are saying that's going to hurt the poor.
[00:02:21.698 --> 00:02:28.560]  Quite frankly, Alex, Harvard did a study and said when you throw out the burdensome compliance of the IRS, he said the prices are going to drop.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.741]  The prices will probably be similar to what we have now.
[00:02:31.181 --> 00:02:39.985]  But finally, for those naysayers, those people who are under the poverty level will simply take their pay stubs to the government and there will be a system as there exists now.
[00:02:39.985 --> 00:02:45.968]  The only difference with the trafficking bill, Alex, is everybody must work who gets a government stipend.
[00:02:45.968 --> 00:02:56.433]  I don't care if they have 12 children, did work at the daycare center with those children, but you see, anybody that visits Broadway or visits Las Vegas from Germany and Japan did pay into our tax scheme.
[00:02:56.833 --> 00:02:59.815]  And finally, it's a trade reciprocity program.
[00:02:59.815 --> 00:03:03.258]  If a country has barriers against ours, we have barriers against them.
[00:03:03.258 --> 00:03:09.342]  We also quantify the standard of living in each country and weigh that down with tariffs as necessary.
[00:03:09.342 --> 00:03:19.329]  But it's a flat 25% final retail sales tax, no taxes on used materials, but just new retail sales and services.
[00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.271]  And Alex, if the country does not move to this scheme,
[00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:25.133]  America will implode like the Soviet Union.
[00:03:25.133 --> 00:03:27.796]  That's my prediction right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:03:27.796 --> 00:03:29.718]  Well, Congressman, I've seen the similar studies.
[00:03:29.718 --> 00:03:31.199]  I've talked to economists.
[00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:36.824]  It would be good if we only had one federal tax other than the tariffs they could raise money with.
[00:03:36.824 --> 00:03:42.790]  The problem is, Obama and others, they want a VAT on every level on top of the income tax.
[00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:43.971]  Yes, this is the problem.
[00:03:43.971 --> 00:03:45.632]  You gotta throw the income tax out.
[00:03:45.632 --> 00:03:49.776]  It was founded, and it's the predicate of the communist platform, of Karl Marx.
[00:03:49.776 --> 00:03:51.117]  And it's done just that.
[00:03:51.117 --> 00:03:53.539]  It's made a dependent society over here.
[00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:57.003]  It's penalized work, and that's the last thing that the founders wanted.
[00:03:57.003 --> 00:04:04.049]  The reason we have the 16th Amendment, Alex, is when we first started the income tax, which, by the way, was only supposed to be on the rich people.
[00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:09.091]  It was taken to the Supreme Court, and it was struck down as unconstitutional.
[00:04:09.091 --> 00:04:17.873]  As a result, we have this 16th Amendment, and some people feel that it wasn't adequately ratified to boot, and that maybe we shouldn't repeal the 16th Amendment.
[00:04:17.873 --> 00:04:19.894]  We should just disregard it because it wasn't
[00:04:20.374 --> 00:04:21.455]  In fact, lawful.
[00:04:21.455 --> 00:04:22.855]  But I think let's be safe.
[00:04:22.855 --> 00:04:24.776]  Let's repeal the 16th Amendment.
[00:04:24.776 --> 00:04:25.877]  Abolish the IRS.
[00:04:25.877 --> 00:04:27.558]  We don't need a Department of Energy.
[00:04:27.558 --> 00:04:29.399]  We don't need a Department of Education.
[00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:31.720]  There's too damn much government here, Alex.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.502]  And what we don't need is we don't need more taxes on top of income taxes.
[00:04:36.545 --> 00:04:38.067]  James Traficant, stay there.
[00:04:38.067 --> 00:04:47.596]  Quick break, coming back with a long segment, talking about a host of issues and the demonization of the Tea Parties all over the news, saying they're racist, they're terrorists.
[00:04:47.596 --> 00:04:54.904]  Bill Clinton says that there's going to be another Oklahoma City and it's going to be the fault of the American people.
[00:04:54.904 --> 00:04:57.206]  We'll see what James Traficant says about that.
[00:04:57.206 --> 00:04:58.047]  Congressman, stay with us.
[00:04:59.386 --> 00:05:01.289]  Dog chewed your remote control?
[00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:02.330]  Lost your remote?
[00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.913]  Or is your remote control just not working?

[00:06:17.423 --> 00:06:24.087]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:24.087 --> 00:06:30.051]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:34.254]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:06:34.254 --> 00:06:38.537]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:38.537 --> 00:06:41.319]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies,

[00:06:44.483 --> 00:06:48.028]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:48.028 --> 00:06:50.011]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:50.011 --> 00:06:51.132]  It's here.

[00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.050]  Global meltdowns.
[00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.451]  Massive unemployment.
[00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:03.671]  Endless wars.
[00:07:03.671 --> 00:07:05.312]  A new currency crisis.
[00:07:05.312 --> 00:07:07.392]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[00:07:07.392 --> 00:07:09.553]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[00:07:09.553 --> 00:07:11.434]  So what's the best way to get ready?
[00:07:11.434 --> 00:07:13.534]  To get prepared for hard times ahead.
[00:07:13.534 --> 00:07:15.515]  Introducing Off The Grid News.

[00:08:01.407 --> 00:08:06.992]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.129 --> 00:08:14.233]  James Traficant, former congressman, is our guest.
[00:08:14.233 --> 00:08:15.514]  I've researched his case.
[00:08:15.514 --> 00:08:16.835]  It's even been on national news.
[00:08:16.835 --> 00:08:26.543]  They've admitted he was completely railroaded, set up, mainly because he was criticizing foreign aid, period, and foreign aid to Israel.
[00:08:26.543 --> 00:08:27.584]  And they told him they were going to get him.
[00:08:28.224 --> 00:08:31.745]  And we had Jane Graham, Oklahoma City bombing survivor.
[00:08:31.745 --> 00:08:33.205]  She was on the ninth floor on last week.
[00:08:33.205 --> 00:08:38.746]  She saw McVeigh and other feds planting gray sticks of butter, didn't know what they were.
[00:08:38.746 --> 00:08:40.067]  She brought this info to Congress.
[00:08:40.067 --> 00:08:40.787]  They wouldn't talk to her.
[00:08:40.787 --> 00:08:44.587]  The only person that would look at the information was James Traficant.
[00:08:44.587 --> 00:08:47.188]  And she said she talked to James Traficant's assistant in his office.
[00:08:47.188 --> 00:08:50.069]  She said, yeah, they came and said, give us those documents back.
[00:08:52.289 --> 00:08:55.311]  I'll be filing this coming Monday as an independent in one of two districts, I'm not sure.
[00:09:13.542 --> 00:09:14.443]  We're good to go.
[00:09:35.362 --> 00:09:41.904]  Well, you've certainly got a lot of name recognition and a lot of people love you and your state there and know that you were railroaded.
[00:09:41.904 --> 00:09:52.966]  We talked about that some last time, but perhaps because we have a new audience tuning in all the time, recap what happened to you and then we're going to get into some of the current things that are happening and get your take on it, like U.S.
[00:09:52.966 --> 00:09:56.087]  Army trains to confront Tea Party terrorists.
[00:09:56.087 --> 00:09:56.967]  This is confirmed.
[00:09:56.967 --> 00:10:02.548]  We have their internal training manuals where they prepare for gun confiscation and war against the American people.
[00:10:02.548 --> 00:10:04.849]  But first, recapping your railroading.
[00:10:05.501 --> 00:10:10.685]  Well, you know, number one, several of the people that were involved already now admitted they were pressured to lie.
[00:10:10.685 --> 00:10:20.494]  There's a young man in Nigeria, a young black man, that filed an affidavit with the Nigerian government, Mr. Okolo, that his life was ruined because he wouldn't perjure himself against trafficking.
[00:10:20.894 --> 00:10:26.437]  Bottom line, it was a six-year investigation, $15 million, over 250 agents.
[00:10:26.437 --> 00:10:36.322]  Honor about the time, Alex, that the Trade Center and the Pentagon were being attacked, and the government voluntarily stated at this trial that they made no tapes on me at all.
[00:10:36.322 --> 00:10:42.826]  And now it's come out, and I can't prove it yet, but it's all over that they burned boxes and boxes of tapes, because there was no physical evidence.
[00:10:43.266 --> 00:10:43.927]  We're good to go.
[00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:14.513]  I want some whistleblower to come forward and confirm that they burned boxes and boxes of tapes they made on Jim Traffickin over a six-year investigation because the reason why they said they had no tapes, Alex, is I could use their own tapes against them and say, where's the crime?
[00:11:14.513 --> 00:11:16.373]  So now I think they're showing it.
[00:11:16.373 --> 00:11:17.373]  I think it's coming out.
[00:11:17.373 --> 00:11:19.454]  I think most people realize what happened.
[00:11:19.454 --> 00:11:25.275]  And remember, I'm the guy that brought John Demonyuk back home from Israel, who was on death row for being Ivan the Terrible.
[00:11:25.275 --> 00:11:27.856]  And maybe this is exclusive on your show today, Alex.
[00:11:28.496 --> 00:11:39.151]  That John Dominik from Germany on trial now has requested of his family and his defense that they bring me into Germany relative to this trial.
[00:11:39.151 --> 00:11:41.815]  And if I am subpoenaed, I am going to Germany.
[00:11:41.815 --> 00:11:43.878]  So that's an exclusive for you, Alex.
[00:11:44.458 --> 00:12:00.099]  And to recap that, the Israeli Supreme Court said you were right, you got him the documents, he was not the guy, we know who he was, looked nothing like this individual, and then still, the US government grabs him and sends him to Germany when Israel said he's innocent!
[00:12:00.239 --> 00:12:01.740]  Yes, and you know what's amazing, Alex?
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.141]  I must give Israel credit for this.
[00:12:03.141 --> 00:12:05.984]  Their Supreme Court took my evidence.
[00:12:05.984 --> 00:12:06.504]  The U.S.
[00:12:06.504 --> 00:12:07.845]  courts wouldn't accept it.
[00:12:07.845 --> 00:12:10.648]  Congress wouldn't hold a hearing because they said it's too sensitive.
[00:12:10.648 --> 00:12:16.272]  And Alex, what I said is, when does sensitivity, quote-unquote sensitivity, waive the Bill of Rights?
[00:12:16.272 --> 00:12:17.673]  My God, what happened to us?
[00:12:17.673 --> 00:12:21.617]  When you endanger the right of one American, you endanger the rights of all Americans.
[00:12:21.617 --> 00:12:25.300]  So, what's happening now, and I want this also as an update on your program,
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:30.263]  Israel would not convene a trial on this new matter.
[00:12:30.263 --> 00:12:32.004]  So they had to go to Germany.
[00:12:32.004 --> 00:12:34.785]  Our government is just trying to cover their tracks.
[00:12:34.785 --> 00:12:37.887]  Alex, they should be charged with attempted murder.
[00:12:37.887 --> 00:12:39.948]  They knew this man wasn't Ivan.
[00:12:39.948 --> 00:12:43.650]  And they suborned perjury, they obstructed justice, and they've got away with it.
[00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:44.951]  They've gotten away with this, Alex.
[00:12:45.191 --> 00:12:46.691]  And they know he's ill.
[00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:48.052]  It's official oppression.
[00:12:48.052 --> 00:12:50.112]  I mean, they know he's innocent.
[00:12:50.112 --> 00:12:51.192]  They're just doing this.
[00:12:51.192 --> 00:12:54.353]  They're hoping he dies before there can even be a trial.
[00:12:54.353 --> 00:12:56.453]  They're trying to cover up for what they did in the past.
[00:12:56.453 --> 00:12:57.814]  Just remember this, Alex.
[00:12:57.814 --> 00:13:06.115]  The documents that I got that took him off a death row after being convicted were Justice Department documents.
[00:13:06.115 --> 00:13:08.476]  And the Justice Department knew that he was not the guy?
[00:13:08.476 --> 00:13:09.596]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[00:13:09.596 --> 00:13:10.776]  This is out of hand.
[00:13:10.776 --> 00:13:12.217]  We need a mechanism.
[00:13:12.217 --> 00:13:13.417]  We need a mechanism, Alex.
[00:13:14.471 --> 00:13:21.036]  We need a mechanism where the FBI and the Justice Department can be, in fact, tried.
[00:13:21.036 --> 00:13:23.557]  One of my last bills was the Fair Justice Act.
[00:13:23.557 --> 00:13:30.162]  The President would nominate, the Senate would confirm for a 10-year term, the Director of the Fair Justice Agency would have only one duty.
[00:13:30.162 --> 00:13:34.825]  Alex and I would be to investigate and prosecute crimes within the Justice Department.
[00:13:34.825 --> 00:13:36.987]  My God, we got a police state coming at us!
[00:13:37.427 --> 00:13:41.529]  We've got a government that, we're basically economic slaves here.
[00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:43.730]  And no one's really looking at it seriously.
[00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.510]  That's why I'm giving you credit.
[00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.411]  You're going out on a limb.
[00:13:47.411 --> 00:13:50.592]  And I remember telling Connie Chung about Pan Am 103.
[00:13:50.592 --> 00:13:53.733]  Be very careful how you handle Pan Am 103.
[00:13:53.733 --> 00:13:58.255]  And she did an hour special on the confidential report I got.
[00:13:58.255 --> 00:14:01.997]  And all I want to say is this, a couple weeks later she was never seen on TV again.
[00:14:03.337 --> 00:14:07.678]  You are a very courageous guy, and I've been following you.
[00:14:07.678 --> 00:14:14.380]  And I know that there are many people in the government that are very upset because you are educating the American people.
[00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.421]  And American people have been dumbed down.
[00:14:16.421 --> 00:14:20.862]  Dumbed down through a mainstream media that has in fact aided and abetted this government.
[00:14:20.862 --> 00:14:21.822]  I don't understand why.
[00:14:24.623 --> 00:14:30.629]  Congressman, I don't want to talk about myself, but I am in the middle of this and I want to ask your advice.
[00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:37.936]  The ADL, the Southern Property Law Center, in the last six months or so have put out multiple reports apiece.
[00:14:37.936 --> 00:14:42.100]  They're now even saying Ron Paul is a terrorist enabler.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.261]  I don't think so.
[00:14:59.894 --> 00:15:00.535]  We're good to go.
[00:15:29.914 --> 00:15:37.820]  It sounds to me as if you're a great American, and you're making touch and contact with the average American, and they don't like it.
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:39.341]  Let me just say this, Alex.
[00:15:39.341 --> 00:15:41.022]  There's no doubt that you're doing that.
[00:15:41.022 --> 00:15:42.684]  Now, here's what you have to be concerned about.
[00:15:42.684 --> 00:15:47.967]  That any technicality could be brought against you, and my God, they can be very vicious.
[00:15:47.967 --> 00:15:49.348]  But let me say this.
[00:15:49.348 --> 00:15:51.350]  I think this is a badge of honor.
[00:15:52.023 --> 00:15:58.269]  My name was mentioned one time in an IRS review that the American people shouldn't listen to Congressman Jim Travigan.
[00:15:58.269 --> 00:15:59.770]  He's just anti-government.
[00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:02.953]  And that was one of the biggest compliments I ever received.
[00:16:02.953 --> 00:16:06.977]  And I think this is a compliment to you because I think it shows you as a leader.
[00:16:06.977 --> 00:16:09.900]  Now the downside is I don't like what they're doing to this Tea Party.
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.821]  These are average American people.
[00:16:11.821 --> 00:16:25.949]  They don't want to blow anything up, and they're not going out there and acting violently, and Alex Jones is not recommending that anybody go out and cause any violence or revolution in this country, and anybody with a bright mind and a reasonable mind understands that.
[00:16:25.949 --> 00:16:29.931]  But what they're trying to do is stop this movement, and the reason for it is very simple.
[00:16:29.931 --> 00:16:32.532]  The American people are fed up, and they should be.
[00:16:32.532 --> 00:16:33.853]  They should be fed up.
[00:16:33.853 --> 00:16:37.495]  And I think what you're doing is you're articulating the reasons why they're fed up.
[00:16:38.075 --> 00:16:45.421]  The problem with the Tea Party, to a degree, is they're so upset, but they don't really understand the total dimension of why they're upset.
[00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:49.464]  And number one, they're just opposing rather than advocating as well.
[00:16:49.464 --> 00:17:02.075]  But I think they're starting to evolve now, Alex, with leadership that they're hearing from individuals like yourself, and from commentary made by you and some others, that they're starting to look and say, look, here's what we've got to do now.
[00:17:02.075 --> 00:17:03.916]  Here's what must be done in the country.
[00:17:03.916 --> 00:17:05.678]  And I think what we have underway
[00:17:06.298 --> 00:17:13.464]  This is a powerful political revolution taking place in the United States of America, and I believe the powers that be are trying to stop it.
[00:17:13.464 --> 00:17:16.987]  They're trying to say that these people are radical, they're racist, they're bigots.
[00:17:16.987 --> 00:17:24.534]  Look, I've been hit with the anti-Semite business, the racist business, the bigot business, but listen to what I stand for.
[00:17:24.534 --> 00:17:30.519]  If you're an illegal immigrant in this country, you're not just an immigrant, you're an illegal immigrant and you should be thrown the hell out.
[00:17:31.059 --> 00:17:36.782]  Enough is enough, and we shouldn't be paying healthcare to take care of people that are driving our costs up.
[00:17:36.782 --> 00:17:38.383]  So that makes me a bigot?
[00:17:38.383 --> 00:17:39.783]  Look, that's just the way it is.
[00:17:39.783 --> 00:17:42.245]  If you're an Hispanic American, you're a friend of mine.
[00:17:42.245 --> 00:17:48.128]  If you're an illegal immigrant, I don't care what nationality you are, you're not a friend of mine and you should be thrown out.
[00:17:48.128 --> 00:17:51.049]  And we've got to do something about that, take care of our borders.
[00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:54.731]  I really feel sorry what's going on in Arizona and the way they're depicting Arizona.
[00:17:55.151 --> 00:18:02.535]  You know, I am the Congressman, Alex, that passed putting 10,000 soldiers on our border and keeping people out and keeping drugs out.
[00:18:02.535 --> 00:18:08.158]  And listen, these soldiers are overseas in Germany and in Japan and in Korea.
[00:18:08.158 --> 00:18:10.239]  They're going to the theater and going to lunch.
[00:18:10.239 --> 00:18:12.160]  They're guarding the borders in the Mideast.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.281]  And God, our borders are wide open!
[00:18:14.281 --> 00:18:18.763]  What kind of national security and homeland security does America have?
[00:18:18.763 --> 00:18:20.104]  This is a joke?
[00:18:20.104 --> 00:18:21.224]  Both of these parties are...
[00:18:22.745 --> 00:18:29.389]  Basically, trying to seduce this growing minority population of Hispanics into a voting bloc.
[00:18:29.389 --> 00:18:32.852]  And it's larger now than the African-American community.
[00:18:32.852 --> 00:18:33.952]  Enough is enough.
[00:18:33.952 --> 00:18:35.593]  Let's take care of our government.
[00:18:35.593 --> 00:18:36.934]  Call us what you want.
[00:18:36.934 --> 00:18:40.837]  But I just pray to God that you just continue to do what you're doing.
[00:18:40.837 --> 00:18:44.519]  The reason they're focusing on you is you're effective.
[00:18:45.512 --> 00:18:48.035]  And that's the reason they focused on you, and that's what's scary.
[00:18:48.035 --> 00:18:50.658]  I don't want to go to prison with them setting me up for something.
[00:18:50.658 --> 00:18:54.642]  Well, don't think that that's forlorn.
[00:18:54.642 --> 00:18:56.464]  Here's the thing I could be concerned about.
[00:18:56.464 --> 00:19:05.373]  You know, I don't know what your relationship is with your network, but there'll be people behind the scenes trying to take that microphone away from you because you're having an impact.
[00:19:05.373 --> 00:19:05.914]  I know it.
[00:19:05.914 --> 00:19:07.596]  Let me tell you how I know about it.
[00:19:08.714 --> 00:19:14.098]  I can't explain to you how many times people have said to me, I heard your comments on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:14.098 --> 00:19:15.940]  I'm very proud of you.
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.561]  I agree with you.
[00:19:17.561 --> 00:19:19.623]  Thank you for doing the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:19.623 --> 00:19:21.444]  We think Alex does a great job.
[00:19:21.444 --> 00:19:23.285]  We were surprised you were on there.
[00:19:23.285 --> 00:19:24.927]  Some people may be afraid to be on there.
[00:19:24.927 --> 00:19:26.288]  They say, we don't know why.
[00:19:26.288 --> 00:19:28.369]  We're glad you were on there, Jim.
[00:19:28.369 --> 00:19:31.492]  And people, but the bottom line is, I've heard this all over.
[00:19:31.492 --> 00:19:34.254]  People commenting about this everywhere I go, Alex.
[00:19:34.254 --> 00:19:36.816]  So, you're reaching people and I think you're
[00:19:37.276 --> 00:19:46.143]  You're reaching people with an intelligent approach, and there's certainly no doubt in my mind you're not advocating any type of violence or anything.
[00:19:46.143 --> 00:19:46.743]  None of us are.
[00:19:46.743 --> 00:19:49.686]  Congressman, thank you for your kind words on that subject and your advice.
[00:19:49.686 --> 00:19:56.631]  Let's come back in to get into some other issues, but continue to discuss how you see this nation going and talk about Oklahoma City 15 years later.
[00:19:56.631 --> 00:19:57.892]  We'll be right back with James Traficant.
[00:20:00.831 --> 00:20:08.622]  Are you considering taking herbal supplements instead of overpriced and potentially dangerous pharmaceutical drugs, but just not sure where to start?

[00:21:04.951 --> 00:21:06.732]  Genetically modifying.
[00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:09.213]  Mixing vegetables with animals.
[00:21:09.213 --> 00:21:12.094]  And now experimenting with viruses.
[00:21:12.094 --> 00:21:13.155]  Viruses.
[00:21:13.155 --> 00:21:18.897]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:21:18.897 --> 00:21:21.078]  Starve or surrender.
[00:21:21.078 --> 00:21:21.859]  Surrender.
[00:21:21.859 --> 00:21:25.660]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.

[00:23:44.597 --> 00:23:46.498]  What if I say I'm not just another part of your play?
[00:23:46.498 --> 00:23:46.898]  Jim Gravigan.
[00:24:09.335 --> 00:24:11.776]  Former Congressman is our guest.
[00:24:11.776 --> 00:24:15.958]  Mexico has collapsed because of their phony drug war.
[00:24:15.958 --> 00:24:17.039]  It's totally criminal.
[00:24:17.039 --> 00:24:21.001]  There's murders, ranchers being killed, Texas, Arizona.
[00:24:21.001 --> 00:24:21.881]  I mean, it's a mess.
[00:24:21.881 --> 00:24:23.522]  And then, meanwhile, Washington Post.
[00:24:23.522 --> 00:24:26.043]  Human rights observers killed in attack in Mexico.
[00:24:26.043 --> 00:24:31.366]  And it talks about all over Mexico, they're shutting the power and water off to Indian groups that live down there.
[00:24:31.366 --> 00:24:34.648]  Mexico's very racist towards the Indian population.
[00:24:34.648 --> 00:24:35.348]  I don't know why.
[00:24:35.348 --> 00:24:38.770]  I mean, the folks in Mexico are Indian and Spanish, mainly.
[00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:43.675]  And some Germans that immigrated there during the colonial system.
[00:24:43.675 --> 00:24:44.515]  And then here's another one.
[00:24:44.515 --> 00:24:47.639]  Mexico acknowledges migrant abuse pledges changes.
[00:24:47.639 --> 00:24:49.641]  I mean, they don't give free welfare to any people.
[00:24:49.641 --> 00:24:51.803]  They arrest illegals instantly.
[00:24:51.803 --> 00:24:56.588]  I as an American can't go down there with my wife and have a baby and have it all paid for.
[00:24:56.588 --> 00:24:58.910]  I mean, this is a sick joke, Congressman.
[00:24:59.509 --> 00:25:00.109]  Absolutely.
[00:25:00.109 --> 00:25:01.630]  Alex, you're right on target.
[00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:03.790]  I think we even have to change the Constitution.
[00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:15.274]  If someone comes across our border illegally for the purpose of having a child and having an American citizen, I think that should be changed and the citizenship should be denied and the woman should be removed from the country.
[00:25:15.274 --> 00:25:16.094]  Enough is enough.
[00:25:16.094 --> 00:25:19.315]  No one realizes... You know, we had a case up here in Northeast Ohio.
[00:25:19.315 --> 00:25:20.155]  Just real quick, Alex.
[00:25:20.675 --> 00:25:25.137]  Where a fella went in with a card and got a surgery on his pancreas.
[00:25:25.137 --> 00:25:29.918]  And ten days later, another fella came in with the same card to get surgery, and they did the surgery.
[00:25:29.918 --> 00:25:32.419]  They didn't realize it until they checked the paperwork.
[00:25:32.419 --> 00:25:39.902]  And they were both illegal, can't find them, and did two particular surgeries that the American people, our people up here, ended up paying for.
[00:25:39.902 --> 00:25:41.782]  I mean, this is in our own backyard.
[00:25:41.782 --> 00:25:49.105]  Now, imagine what this is like in voting booths with fake IDs, fake driver's licenses, fake Social Security cards.
[00:25:49.105 --> 00:25:49.945]  It's gone too far.
[00:25:50.706 --> 00:25:58.497]  And now we're talking about, we're talking about making citizens and the state out of illegals who jump the fence.
[00:25:58.497 --> 00:26:04.846]  My God, Alex, this is putting a neon sign right on the border saying, hey, jump the fence and eventually you'll become an American citizen.
[00:26:06.379 --> 00:26:10.203]  Well, the feds are financing illegal checkpoints through the states everywhere.
[00:26:10.203 --> 00:26:18.992]  All this Arizona law says is that if they have suspicion and then you're an illegal, when they pull you over for drunk driving or whatever it is, that the state's going to take you to the feds.
[00:26:18.992 --> 00:26:21.294]  I mean, all that's doing is enforcing the law.
[00:26:21.294 --> 00:26:26.259]  Since when are states not supposed to, you know, if they catch somebody committing a federal crime, to not arrest them?
[00:26:26.864 --> 00:26:27.284]  Amen.
[00:26:27.284 --> 00:26:30.485]  It's the United States of America, not the federal government of America.
[00:26:30.485 --> 00:26:32.265]  And let me say this on your show.
[00:26:32.265 --> 00:26:34.186]  I support the Arizona law.
[00:26:34.186 --> 00:26:37.387]  Because the reason for the Arizona machination is simple.
[00:26:37.387 --> 00:26:41.488]  The federal government has failed to act on behalf of the American people.
[00:26:41.488 --> 00:26:44.668]  The federal government's job is for national security.
[00:26:44.668 --> 00:26:48.949]  And how the hell can you have national security with a border that's not secure?
[00:26:48.949 --> 00:26:50.370]  Someone tell me that.
[00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:52.070]  So, I support.
[00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:54.791]  I support what they're doing in Arizona, and they've got to stand up.
[00:26:55.291 --> 00:26:58.655]  This is a microcosm of the failed policies of America.
[00:26:58.655 --> 00:27:00.537]  Bring the American people attention to it.
[00:27:00.537 --> 00:27:08.525]  Now, the mainstream media is making Arizona look like racist, look like bigots, and they're going to lose conventions, and they're going to lose money.
[00:27:08.525 --> 00:27:14.511]  Look, the bottom line is the federal government has caused this problem for Arizona and for all these border states.
[00:27:14.511 --> 00:27:16.774]  The federal government should be taking the brunt of the attack.
[00:27:17.214 --> 00:27:20.895]  That's why they don't like Alex Jones, and that's why they don't like Jim Travigan.
[00:27:20.895 --> 00:27:23.837]  Because the truth of the matter is very plain for us to see.
[00:27:23.837 --> 00:27:26.758]  The federal government has failed to secure our borders.
[00:27:26.758 --> 00:27:31.559]  How can you have a Homeland Security program with a border wide open, Alex?
[00:27:31.559 --> 00:27:46.165]  Well, what do you think about Obama announcing yesterday he's sending SWAT teams to quote all the oil regs, and some Reagan administration officials are on record saying they believe this is greasing the skids for the feds nationalizing oil.
[00:27:47.319 --> 00:27:48.440]  I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.962]  The way the country's going, we've nationalized everything.
[00:27:50.962 --> 00:27:52.783]  Just keep this in mind.
[00:27:52.783 --> 00:27:58.828]  General Motors, government motor stock, is now trading at 27 cents a share.
[00:27:58.828 --> 00:28:00.369]  Let's be honest about this.
[00:28:00.369 --> 00:28:03.571]  We have buoyed up a false economic illusion here.
[00:28:03.571 --> 00:28:07.074]  All these new hires they're talking about, Alex, were census workers.
[00:28:07.074 --> 00:28:13.779]  Now you've got a health bill with, listen to this, 159 new boards, programs, and entities to be created.
[00:28:14.532 --> 00:28:24.076]  More IRS enforcement, plus an additional 16,500 IRS employees to be hired at a cost of $1.7 trillion.
[00:28:24.076 --> 00:28:30.139]  All of these jobs, we have more government workers than factory workers already, and this is a false illusion.
[00:28:30.139 --> 00:28:36.882]  I think the best thing that could be done is the states have got to put their foot down here, and that we have no more states right.
[00:28:37.402 --> 00:28:44.685]  They're background music in a doctor's office, and maybe Arizona will highlight the issue of the United States of America.
[00:28:44.685 --> 00:28:49.427]  Remember, there used to be a nation known as USSR, and now they broke up.
[00:28:49.427 --> 00:28:52.049]  Don't think we can't implode, and I predict that.
[00:28:52.049 --> 00:28:58.772]  I predict, unless there's a direct intended change in taxes that starts to reward work, that we're going to implode.
[00:28:58.772 --> 00:28:59.712]  It's just a matter of time.
[00:29:00.785 --> 00:29:07.630]  Well, you got the federal government calling for carbon taxes, but then China and India and Mexico and others don't have to have the carbon taxes.
[00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:09.452]  I mean, that will kill the economy.
[00:29:09.452 --> 00:29:11.533]  Why does the federal government want to kill the economy?
[00:29:11.533 --> 00:29:12.274]  You know what, Alex?
[00:29:12.274 --> 00:29:21.321]  What's really funny is the reports in the House say, the Forensic Reports say, that most of the carbon problems in America are brought in from the trade winds from the Far East.
[00:29:22.242 --> 00:29:23.763]  From China and Japan.
[00:29:23.763 --> 00:29:28.667]  And these countries don't want to do anything about their carbon emissions.
[00:29:28.667 --> 00:29:37.955]  I think, look, I think it's time for us to say we can handle our economic problems, and the world can handle theirs too, but good fences make good boards.
[00:29:37.955 --> 00:29:38.956]  Make good friends.
[00:29:38.956 --> 00:29:40.177]  Stay there, stay there.
[00:29:40.177 --> 00:29:43.020]  Jim Travagant, former Congresswoman of Ohio, is our guest.
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:49.225]  We'll talk about Oklahoma City straight ahead, and a lot more in his campaign, how you can get involved in it, getting back in Congress.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:54.063]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.063 --> 00:29:56.745]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:07.468]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoods Direct was putting together a high-volume, pre-production order of the new Quick Fix meals.
[00:30:07.468 --> 00:30:14.835]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive one free item for every three that they bought.
[00:30:14.835 --> 00:30:21.821]  Since the final shutdown of this buy three, get one free program, we've had a lot of folks calling, disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[00:30:21.821 --> 00:30:22.662]  Listen carefully.
[00:30:23.022 --> 00:30:32.747]  Starting immediately, efoodsdirect.com will take pre-production orders for a buy three get one free program for one week ending May 14th at midnight.
[00:30:32.747 --> 00:30:36.969]  You will receive one free item for every three that you order of the selected products.
[00:30:36.969 --> 00:30:39.970]  These orders will begin shipping the first week of June.
[00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:43.252]  To order on the web, efoodsdirect.com slash alex
[00:30:43.892 --> 00:30:44.153]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:30:59.178 --> 00:31:00.478]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:00.478 --> 00:31:06.060]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:11.082]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:31:11.082 --> 00:31:16.104]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:31:16.644 --> 00:31:21.866]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:31:21.866 --> 00:31:28.990]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:30.110]  And here's the best part.
[00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:36.473]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:31:36.793 --> 00:31:39.975]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:31:39.975 --> 00:31:42.197]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[00:31:43.077 --> 00:31:43.397]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:31:43.397 --> 00:31:46.780]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:48.521]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:32:00.694 --> 00:32:04.655]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:04.655 --> 00:32:13.517]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:32:13.517 --> 00:32:18.138]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:32:18.138 --> 00:32:28.960]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:39.103]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:39.103 --> 00:32:44.545]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:32:44.545 --> 00:32:52.028]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:52.028 --> 00:32:54.789]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:33:07.128 --> 00:33:09.432]  We are back live with Jim Traficant.
[00:33:09.432 --> 00:33:10.673]  What an interesting person.
[00:33:10.673 --> 00:33:18.925]  He's not only a former congressman, he was drafted into the NFL for the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1963.
[00:33:18.925 --> 00:33:23.312]  He also obtained a master's degree from the University of Pittsburgh and another from York
[00:33:24.275 --> 00:33:26.016]  Youngstown State University.
[00:33:26.016 --> 00:33:45.144]  We're going to be going back to him here in just a moment to talk about Oklahoma City and some other subjects, and also take some phone calls for the congressman, and they can also talk about the experiences they've had with law enforcement and the military being militarized to go up against the American people.
[00:33:45.144 --> 00:33:46.785]  But Jim Traficant is our guest.
[00:33:46.785 --> 00:33:49.746]  We've had two new films come out in the month of April.
[00:33:50.729 --> 00:33:54.070]  And one is Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined.
[00:33:54.070 --> 00:34:04.831]  Two hours plus, jam-packed, 18 months in the making, government narcotics trafficking, white slavery running, staging terror attacks, police state, how the globalists operate.
[00:34:04.831 --> 00:34:06.532]  I mean, it's an encyclopedia.
[00:34:06.532 --> 00:34:09.772]  The new film available on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:09.772 --> 00:34:12.553]  And your purchase of the DVD also supports our broadcast.
[00:34:12.553 --> 00:34:14.693]  You can make copies of it, give it to everyone you know.
[00:34:14.693 --> 00:34:16.373]  The people are ready to be awakened.
[00:34:16.373 --> 00:34:19.834]  And I don't really get the credit for the effect this show's having.
[00:34:20.954 --> 00:34:24.815]  It's really you, the listeners, that are taking action, so I want to thank all of you that have taken action.
[00:34:24.815 --> 00:34:29.796]  And of course, we released this film last week, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[00:34:29.796 --> 00:34:37.258]  A year in the making, covers the police state, the military being trained to take on the American people, and so much more.
[00:34:37.258 --> 00:34:45.920]  It proves that the underwear bombing was a staged event, with eyewitnesses that we interviewed that were on the plane, and that saw the feds getting him on the plane, and that's now been admitted, by the way.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:46.420]  Police State 4.
[00:34:47.893 --> 00:34:52.535]  The Rise of FEMA, you can get both the films together and get them discounted or you can also call toll free to order 888-253-3139 888-253-3139
[00:35:00.692 --> 00:35:07.957]  And you can also watch the films in super high quality and this live broadcast that we simulcast on the radio at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:35:07.957 --> 00:35:09.038]  Going back to Jim Traficant.
[00:35:09.038 --> 00:35:10.759]  Jim, Oklahoma City.
[00:35:10.759 --> 00:35:13.001]  I mean, take us back to 1995.
[00:35:13.001 --> 00:35:18.585]  And again, the reason I bring this up is, I mean, you've been involved in everything I investigate.
[00:35:18.585 --> 00:35:21.507]  If it's exposing tyranny, you find Jim Traficant there.
[00:35:21.507 --> 00:35:22.228]  I didn't even know.
[00:35:22.828 --> 00:35:49.698]  That no member of Congress would talk to her and other survivors of that horrible bombing, that she saw the feds in there, what she later learned, planting bombs with telephone wire and gray sticks of butter in the weeks before, including Tim McVeigh and others, and that when she and others brought you this information, that you were the only person that would look at it, and that she said that your staff said that you were threatened to shut up about it, but that you wouldn't shut up.
[00:35:51.219 --> 00:35:52.544]  Give us your take on what happened there.
[00:35:52.987 --> 00:36:04.897]  Number one, I don't think there's any way that that truckload of fertilizer that exploded outside could have had the type of impact internally that showed from that.
[00:36:04.897 --> 00:36:07.219]  And immediately, I had my doubts.
[00:36:07.219 --> 00:36:12.443]  What's amazing about it is, the reason I was the only one, is Congress is afraid.
[00:36:12.443 --> 00:36:14.945]  Most members of Congress don't want to get involved in anything.
[00:36:14.945 --> 00:36:17.667]  First of all, they're made to look like a kook if you do.
[00:36:17.667 --> 00:36:22.191]  Second of all, they're made to look like you're un-American if you do, because they're going to have the mainstream press against you.
[00:36:22.871 --> 00:36:27.696]  But since the Demonia case, everybody would rely on me, and I got most of the information.
[00:36:27.696 --> 00:36:41.051]  What I found out and what I felt would happen in Oklahoma City, that there was much broader conspiracy and activity involved there, and I wouldn't be surprised, for some reason, that there were complications that involved government and government officials as well.
[00:36:41.784 --> 00:36:43.805]  That's what my deduction was.
[00:36:43.805 --> 00:36:52.370]  But I couldn't get to first base with anything, Alex, and you have to understand, you have to have something concrete, which I was able to develop in the Demoniuk case.
[00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:57.414]  They couldn't get around the evidence, but I had to send it to an Israeli Supreme Court to get anything done with it.
[00:36:57.414 --> 00:37:06.559]  So you could imagine the problem I was getting trying to get and garner and glean more information relative to the Oklahoma City bombing.
[00:37:06.559 --> 00:37:07.880]  But what I can say is this.
[00:37:08.965 --> 00:37:14.950]  There's a lot more to it, and I don't believe anything anymore the government is telling the American people.
[00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:19.734]  I don't want to get involved in the 9-1-1 issue, but I have my doubts about 9-1-1 as well.
[00:37:19.734 --> 00:37:27.141]  Now remember, I got the demonic information, and I got the actual factual information on Pan Am 103.
[00:37:27.141 --> 00:37:31.905]  And I know exactly what happened to Pan Am 103, and it's not what our government said happened.
[00:37:32.313 --> 00:37:34.274]  Tell us what happened with Pan Am 103.
[00:37:34.274 --> 00:37:46.243]  The report I got was an intelligence report that said a man named Ahmed Jibril and Manzour Al-Qassar were hired by Iran to respond to America's shooting down of that Iranian Airbus, if you recall that.
[00:37:46.243 --> 00:37:46.763]  Yes.
[00:37:46.763 --> 00:37:50.966]  And they put together an international team and they couldn't find a target.
[00:37:50.966 --> 00:37:58.572]  And Manzour Al-Qassar, who shipped heroin from the Golden Triangle to New York through Frankfurt,
[00:38:00.094 --> 00:38:19.204]  Started to see Ahmed Jibril's people around Frankfurt Airport, and supposedly he was worried it was going to ruin his gravy train, and there was an anonymous call made warning there was going to be a terrorist act around the airport, but there was no increase in security to more or less chase Ahmed Jibril away.
[00:38:19.204 --> 00:38:22.606]  The bottom line is the plane went down over Lockerbie.
[00:38:22.606 --> 00:38:26.068]  It was supposed to go down over the ocean, but wind drift took it over Lockerbie.
[00:38:26.608 --> 00:38:27.788]  Here's the things I could tell you.
[00:38:27.788 --> 00:38:33.710]  Number one, there was an anonymous call made at Frankfurt International with no increase in security.
[00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:43.654]  And second of all, two weeks after the incident, first President Bush asked for Ahmed Jibril to be extradited to the United States and Syria denied it.
[00:38:43.654 --> 00:38:50.056]  Manzour Al-Qassar was the biggest heroin man and he made his living
[00:38:50.757 --> 00:38:52.599]  Shipping to America.
[00:38:52.599 --> 00:39:02.967]  Now, what the report said was that he was influential, Alex, in getting French hostages released from Iran, and he was working with the CIA Lebanon office to get American hostages.
[00:39:02.967 --> 00:39:05.949]  At the time, I believe there were eight there, Alex.
[00:39:05.949 --> 00:39:15.917]  It said that there was nothing good happening, so the CIA sent a team to see what was going on, headed by an Army Major McKee from Pittsburgh on leave to the CIA.
[00:39:15.917 --> 00:39:18.719]  Alex, all of those five CIA agents and
[00:39:19.554 --> 00:39:27.797]  Major McKee were killed on that 103 flight but what it was is our government
[00:39:28.658 --> 00:39:40.047]  The report says, covered up the truthful incident, because the American people knew that heroin was being overlooked because this valuable asset, Monserrat Casar, did be a revolution over here.
[00:39:40.047 --> 00:39:48.193]  So the first thing the government said is trafficking is anti-government, CIA said it's nonsense, and naturally no one went with it, but Connie Chung went with it.
[00:39:48.193 --> 00:39:53.838]  And the truth of the matter was, they end up arresting these two Libyans, one of them was even released.
[00:39:53.838 --> 00:39:57.681]  And believe me, if they were guilty, they'd have choked on a chicken bone over there in Qaddafi's prison.
[00:39:58.314 --> 00:40:00.515]  This is the truth of what happened in 103.
[00:40:00.515 --> 00:40:03.856]  So I didn't have the time to look into 911, but I'll tell you this.
[00:40:03.856 --> 00:40:06.917]  I was starting to get reports, Alec.
[00:40:06.917 --> 00:40:09.198]  People were starting to confide in me.
[00:40:09.198 --> 00:40:12.720]  And what I don't like is, I don't believe the Commission.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:15.821]  I didn't believe the Warren Commission, and I didn't believe the Commission
[00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:18.168]  On 9-1-1.
[00:40:18.168 --> 00:40:25.453]  I believe these commissions are nothing more than to ensure that there's no reprisals and repercussions from the American people.
[00:40:25.453 --> 00:40:27.335]  And I think that's why they're concerned about you.
[00:40:27.335 --> 00:40:29.797]  I think you're exposing these things.
[00:40:29.797 --> 00:40:32.178]  And I think America's better off if we know the truth.
[00:40:32.178 --> 00:40:34.660]  If we know the truth about our government.
[00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:36.662]  And this is where I think the problem is.
[00:40:36.662 --> 00:40:39.043]  The American people don't trust the government anymore.
[00:40:39.043 --> 00:40:41.105]  And I see a tremendous upheaval.
[00:40:41.765 --> 00:40:44.186]  I see an American political revolution.
[00:40:44.186 --> 00:40:51.890]  Now, maybe 2010 may not be the actual fulcrum for that occurring, but it's not far off, Alex.
[00:40:51.890 --> 00:41:07.337]  You're going to see a tremendous upheaval in this country where the American people are going to respond to this illegal immigration issue, this so-called cap-and-trade type issue, this big government healthcare issue with 159 new boards, and going to, in fact,
[00:41:08.837 --> 00:41:12.500]  In fact, ensure almost 50 million illegal immigrants.
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:16.163]  There's a hell of a lot more than 12 to 15 illegals in this country, Alex.
[00:41:16.163 --> 00:41:20.366]  When the truth comes out, I think you're going to, the American people are going to revolt.
[00:41:20.366 --> 00:41:24.089]  But, I think it's going to be a peaceful revolution, and let me say this.
[00:41:24.089 --> 00:41:30.094]  I know that you've never advocated violence, but you are advocating that the American people take a stand.
[00:41:30.094 --> 00:41:35.338]  Now what bothers me is, they're trying to paint this Tea Party as something sinister, and it's not.
[00:41:35.959 --> 00:41:42.783]  You know what bothers me more than that is all these politicians keep saying, we need you to vote, we need you to get involved in government.
[00:41:42.783 --> 00:41:44.784]  Well, here's a group that's getting involved.
[00:41:44.784 --> 00:41:48.866]  They're getting very involved and everybody's saying, whoa, we don't want you to be involved.
[00:41:48.866 --> 00:41:50.206]  Well, it's what they're calling for.
[00:41:50.206 --> 00:42:01.572]  I mean, they're calling for lower taxes, abolish the Federal Reserve, have national sovereignty, defend our borders, defend the Second Amendment, do what this country was built on to be Americans.
[00:42:01.572 --> 00:42:03.333]  And that was the question I was about to bring back up.
[00:42:04.227 --> 00:42:13.036]  Bill Clinton and others go on TV and say, gee, I hope there isn't another Oklahoma City caused by the Tea Parties, but I'm afraid it's going to happen.
[00:42:13.036 --> 00:42:22.525]  The only card that criminal elements of the government can play is to stage a terror attack, another Oklahoma City in this country, to go after the American people.
[00:42:22.525 --> 00:42:28.011]  And I see them framing myself by name, but the entire Tea Party and Libertarians and Ron Paul
[00:42:29.296 --> 00:42:30.577]  Alex is very unfortunate.
[00:42:30.577 --> 00:42:32.998]  I've said this without disrespect, but I'm going to say it right here on your show.
[00:42:32.998 --> 00:42:34.738]  They don't call Clinton Slick Willie for nothing.
[00:42:46.167 --> 00:42:47.748]  The Democrats are worried.
[00:42:47.748 --> 00:42:55.552]  They're worried the American people are going to take their venom out on the party in power, as they did years ago, when they drew Hastert and the Republicans out.
[00:42:55.552 --> 00:42:58.654]  Truth of the matter is, both of these parties have been compromised.
[00:42:58.654 --> 00:43:01.235]  I talked about it on the Greta Van Susteren Show.
[00:43:01.235 --> 00:43:02.856]  I talked about it on your show.
[00:43:02.856 --> 00:43:04.177]  I've been labeled an anti-Semite.
[00:43:04.597 --> 00:43:09.181]  We have basically a foreign nation, Israel, who's controlling the American Congress.
[00:43:09.181 --> 00:43:11.843]  They've got us in two wars and have bankrupted us.
[00:43:11.843 --> 00:43:17.567]  And now, we're in a situation where the American people are saying, why are our kids coming back in body bags?
[00:43:17.567 --> 00:43:19.269]  What are we doing over there?
[00:43:19.269 --> 00:43:22.251]  Why are we continuing to go bankrupt with these wars?
[00:43:22.251 --> 00:43:27.135]  Now they're starting to sense that the American people don't even control their Congress, which they don't.
[00:43:27.635 --> 00:43:39.259]  This is the tragedy here, but to have former President Clinton, who is still very popular, come out and say, my God, if something bad is going to happen, because this Tea Party, this Tea Party can produce some bad things.
[00:43:39.259 --> 00:43:44.941]  Look, if there's anything bad that happened, it's because the American people were totally disgusted.
[00:43:44.941 --> 00:43:52.064]  A man who flew his plane into an IRS building in Texas, a man who bulldozed his home in Ohio because he was tired at the bank,
[00:43:53.024 --> 00:43:54.005]  This is what's happening.
[00:43:54.005 --> 00:44:01.954]  You're seeing the American people react because their government is failing to address the problems that exist in the country.
[00:44:01.954 --> 00:44:02.735]  Period.
[00:44:02.735 --> 00:44:05.739]  I agree with you and there's lots of things happening that are real but...
[00:44:06.483 --> 00:44:29.476]  If you look at the preconditioning and the buildup and even the Hattari militia, we've documented that was a total federal setup with people inside provocateuring them to shoot their mouths off and so they're having these busts to create this background story that, oh look, the gun owners are about to attack and we know, we have the documents, that they're training the military for gun confiscation.
[00:44:29.476 --> 00:44:32.318]  We've had the mayor of Schenectady, New York, we've had
[00:44:33.758 --> 00:44:39.381]  House reps and the legislature of Illinois and others calling for troops on the streets.
[00:44:39.381 --> 00:44:41.182]  I mean, this is getting really creepy.
[00:44:41.182 --> 00:44:43.863]  Well, let me tell you, the politicians should be calling for troops.
[00:44:43.863 --> 00:44:45.124]  Troops on the border.
[00:44:45.124 --> 00:44:46.965]  To stay off of the American people.
[00:44:46.965 --> 00:44:49.846]  And that second amendment wasn't to protect duck hunters.
[00:44:49.846 --> 00:44:52.627]  It was to protect the American people from a government.
[00:44:52.627 --> 00:44:55.889]  And let me tell you something, they're bringing this on themselves.
[00:44:55.889 --> 00:44:59.991]  But the good thing that's happening is all these issues are now coming to light, Alex.
[00:45:00.583 --> 00:45:02.524]  They're coming to light because of you.
[00:45:02.524 --> 00:45:04.884]  And as a leader, you as a leader.
[00:45:04.884 --> 00:45:07.805]  And there are others out there, but they're not as strong.
[00:45:07.805 --> 00:45:09.486]  This is what I'm saying to you.
[00:45:09.486 --> 00:45:11.447]  Now you have to be very careful.
[00:45:11.447 --> 00:45:15.528]  They will make some technicality into a major cardinal crime.
[00:45:15.528 --> 00:45:17.008]  And that's the way it works.
[00:45:17.008 --> 00:45:20.970]  So I think, you having heard these comments, I think you know that.
[00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:21.550]  You're very intelligent.
[00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:24.571]  No, I know and I'm very aware of it and I appreciate you talking about it.
[00:45:25.271 --> 00:45:27.312]  I mean, I never intended to have this big of an effect.
[00:45:27.312 --> 00:45:33.654]  I mean, I wanted to have an effect, but I didn't know I'd get in a position where there's so many of these documents that are saying, there's the enemy, get him, get him.
[00:45:33.654 --> 00:45:37.316]  But I've talked to so many troops that have called me and sent us information.
[00:45:37.316 --> 00:45:43.818]  They say that's why the troops and police then tune into the show, because they're told, don't listen to Alex Jones, he's bad.
[00:45:43.818 --> 00:45:49.000]  I mean, the government is smart at certain levels, but it's also stupid.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.301]  Alex, you know the amazing thing?
[00:45:50.301 --> 00:45:53.722]  When I brought John Demme and you home, I got a number of calls.
[00:45:54.551 --> 00:45:55.532]  Sort of, just like this.
[00:45:55.532 --> 00:45:56.652]  Just listen.
[00:45:56.652 --> 00:45:57.693]  Good job, Congressman.
[00:45:57.693 --> 00:45:58.373]  We're proud of you.
[00:45:58.373 --> 00:45:59.653]  Hang up.
[00:45:59.653 --> 00:46:00.694]  Good job, Congressman.
[00:46:00.694 --> 00:46:01.914]  Hang up.
[00:46:01.914 --> 00:46:05.296]  The reason those calls were so quick is they were coming from the Justice Department.
[00:46:06.198 --> 00:46:10.480]  Believe me, the people in the government knew what they did to Dominic.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:13.282]  There's a lot of people in the government that don't like what's going on, Alec.
[00:46:13.282 --> 00:46:16.404]  There's a lot of people in the government that are listening to you.
[00:46:16.404 --> 00:46:19.145]  Now, the problem is we're starting to get all this militia talk.
[00:46:19.145 --> 00:46:22.487]  We need militia because we've got all these groups that are establishing.
[00:46:22.487 --> 00:46:28.190]  Look, all of the government's troops should be concentrating on securing our borders
[00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:29.491]  We're good to go.
[00:46:48.308 --> 00:46:59.138]  Democrat presidents and what they're saying loud and clear and everybody's trying to dilute it because they're afraid that the party in power is going to be removed and that's where President Clinton come in.
[00:46:59.138 --> 00:47:06.224]  I think it's very unfortunate that he made that statement but I'm going to make this statement on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:06.224 --> 00:47:08.606]  They don't call him Slick Willie for nothing.
[00:47:09.483 --> 00:47:09.803]  Let me...
[00:47:40.211 --> 00:47:41.791]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:47:41.791 --> 00:47:43.152]  This is what I'm saying.
[00:47:43.152 --> 00:47:44.732]  Disregard that statement.
[00:47:44.732 --> 00:47:46.393]  That's a political statement.
[00:47:46.393 --> 00:47:48.433]  That's not a national security statement.
[00:47:48.433 --> 00:47:50.214]  And it's unfortunate.
[00:47:50.214 --> 00:47:51.094]  Let me bring up another issue.
[00:47:51.094 --> 00:47:56.576]  I'm going to take a few calls for you and also give out your address for people that want to support your campaign or physically get involved.
[00:47:56.576 --> 00:47:57.516]  You're filing money.
[00:47:57.516 --> 00:47:59.717]  We want to have you back as that unfolds.
[00:47:59.717 --> 00:48:01.677]  You're very gracious with your time, sir.
[00:48:01.677 --> 00:48:04.598]  Again, Jim Traficant joining us.
[00:48:04.598 --> 00:48:08.039]  It has come out that a lot of Republicans and Democrats are gay.
[00:48:08.934 --> 00:48:14.478]  And I'm not attacking him for that, but that they're being blackmailed, like if they're a drug dealer or they're taking bribes.
[00:48:14.478 --> 00:48:16.980]  There's a lot of different ways you can get compromised.
[00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:23.966]  And the word from really good sources is Obama's being compromised and blackmailed, that Congressman Lindsey Graham was.
[00:48:23.966 --> 00:48:29.830]  The head of Alipac, which is a very serious, focused guy who I've been watching for over a decade.
[00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:32.852]  I've never heard Mr. Gein say something that wasn't true.
[00:48:32.852 --> 00:48:37.556]  He says he's got it down pat that Lindsey Graham is just running around basically all over the place.
[00:48:37.956 --> 00:48:38.436]  It's very big Alex.
[00:48:38.436 --> 00:48:41.258]  Now look, I can't speak on any individual case.
[00:49:03.713 --> 00:49:18.483]  But, again, as I got personal information, remember, I'm the fellow on the House floor that said that Janet Reno was a lesbian and she was controlled by organized crime who had photographs of her with young women.
[00:49:18.483 --> 00:49:21.105]  Now, I was protected by the Speech and Debate Clause.
[00:49:21.761 --> 00:49:29.564]  But I went on again, a national TV show, the Robert Novak Show, and I re-edited those statements, and I said, go ahead, Janet.
[00:49:29.564 --> 00:49:32.065]  I'm not protected by the speech and debate clause.
[00:49:32.065 --> 00:49:45.110]  Take me to court because maybe now we'll find out why you will not allow an investigation in 10 million dollars from a red Chinese army general that went to President Clinton's campaign fund.
[00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:46.770]  And I never heard a word from her.
[00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:47.891]  Now, they put me in prison.
[00:49:48.959 --> 00:49:50.680]  But listen to what I'm telling you.
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:52.662]  She was controlled.
[00:49:52.662 --> 00:49:55.023]  The Attorney General of the United States was controlled.
[00:49:55.023 --> 00:49:59.366]  The CIA and anybody listening to this, the FBI, come on and pick up Jim Travagan.
[00:49:59.366 --> 00:50:00.787]  I'm on probation.
[00:50:00.787 --> 00:50:04.650]  Right here on the Alex Jones Show, I'm saying that she was a lesbian.
[00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:10.875]  She was, in fact, appointed an assistant prosecutor in Dade County, the cocaine capital of America.
[00:50:10.875 --> 00:50:16.939]  She was ultimately, after the prosecutor resigned, appointed a prosecutor, then won re-election.
[00:50:17.924 --> 00:50:28.006]  Now, that's one I knew about, but I can guarantee you there are people in Washington that are afraid to say anything because of their background.
[00:50:28.006 --> 00:50:33.028]  There are people who are afraid, and this is the thing I don't like.
[00:50:33.028 --> 00:50:34.488]  Congressman, I've got to interrupt.
[00:50:34.488 --> 00:50:36.048]  I'm skipping a network break.
[00:50:36.048 --> 00:50:37.509]  This break belongs to the network.
[00:50:37.509 --> 00:50:39.269]  Stations should not run over this.
[00:50:39.269 --> 00:50:41.210]  I'm skipping the break for time.
[00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:42.030]  Go ahead, Congressman.
[00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:59.014]  The bottom line is, I don't know if you remember, but Jane Harman from California was picked up on a voice recorder of promising American-Israeli Public Affairs Committee that she'd get their two spies out of prison if they used their influence to make her the chairman of the Intelligence Committee.
[00:50:59.014 --> 00:51:00.474]  Yeah, that was on the news.
[00:51:00.474 --> 00:51:02.715]  Yeah, but it was hidden away real fast.
[00:51:03.433 --> 00:51:05.454]  And it was hidden away real good.
[00:51:05.454 --> 00:51:12.479]  But do you know that the two spies were ultimately turned loose by our Attorney General Holder?
[00:51:12.479 --> 00:51:15.541]  And he said, we're not sure that they had bad intent.
[00:51:15.541 --> 00:51:24.086]  Well, keep in mind, Alex, that the man that they're working with in the Pentagon, Larry Franklin, is still in prison for 12 years for giving secrets.
[00:51:24.086 --> 00:51:30.030]  And what their efforts were, they were attempting to mobilize the Pentagon to attack Iran.
[00:51:30.896 --> 00:51:32.457]  Look, enough is enough.
[00:51:32.457 --> 00:51:46.989]  Everybody's afraid down there, Alex, and the thing I don't like is the IRS has thousands of times testified before Congress and said the only weapon we have to collect voluntary taxes is the element of fear.
[00:51:46.989 --> 00:51:56.377]  Alex, how does fear, and the word fear, and the process of fear even enter into the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence?
[00:51:56.377 --> 00:51:58.439]  My God, what has happened to us, Alex?
[00:51:58.439 --> 00:51:59.199]  Well, Congressman,
[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:01.821]  I did the research at the time.
[00:52:01.821 --> 00:52:16.351]  I know it was in two major Florida papers that she was actually caught when she was just a prosecutor, so drugged out on alcohol and pills, vomiting in the back of a car in a parking garage with a 13-year-old girl.
[00:52:16.351 --> 00:52:24.657]  It also came out in, I believe it was lawsuits, you can pull this up, that she would go check out kids that had been CPS'd from the CPS.
[00:52:24.657 --> 00:52:25.678]  Did you ever see that info?
[00:52:26.278 --> 00:52:42.107]  No, the information that I had was that the powers that be and the cocaine business had photographs of her with young ladies in compromising situations and she was, she was really ineffective and impotent in anything she'd try and do.
[00:52:42.107 --> 00:52:51.672]  The thing that I, the reason that I got so involved with Janet Reno is she testified before Congress about Waco that they did everything not to push David Koresh over the edge.
[00:52:52.882 --> 00:52:56.944]  Listen, no one got more information than me on that case, Alex, and listen to this.
[00:52:56.944 --> 00:53:01.986]  David Koresh went jogging every morning and went for lunch and went for breakfast in the local town.
[00:53:01.986 --> 00:53:04.767]  They could have arrested him in town and there would have been no problem.
[00:53:04.767 --> 00:53:06.487]  They wanted that siege.
[00:53:06.487 --> 00:53:12.730]  They wanted that siege to try and change the IRS law of these exemptions for these church-related activities.
[00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:14.110]  And it blew up in their face.
[00:53:14.110 --> 00:53:21.433]  But when she testified to Congress and said we didn't want to pressure him and push him over the edge, I wasn't on that committee or I'd have asked her this question.
[00:53:21.813 --> 00:53:36.743]  Then, my God, why did you have strobe lights on that building all night and play the recordings of dying rabbits at the screaming decibel level so high it was heard in villages five miles away if you didn't want to push anybody over the edge?
[00:53:36.743 --> 00:53:37.724]  She lied.
[00:53:37.724 --> 00:53:45.189]  But the thing that bothered me is we had a general of the Red Chinese Army, Alex, that gave $10 million to the Clinton campaign.
[00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:47.311]  And she never investigated it.
[00:53:47.311 --> 00:53:50.314]  She said it wasn't worthy of an investigation.
[00:53:50.314 --> 00:53:55.819]  Now, my God, we have China right now that is controlling much of the money supply in America.
[00:53:55.819 --> 00:53:58.462]  They're controlling the commerce and trade of America.
[00:53:58.462 --> 00:54:03.466]  You have Israel that's controlling the national and international policies of America.
[00:54:03.466 --> 00:54:06.970]  Where the hell did the American people come in, and why isn't anybody saying it?
[00:54:07.904 --> 00:54:11.689]  Well, this is an incredible interview with James Traficant.
[00:54:11.689 --> 00:54:15.174]  I know you're on the road right now, traveling, and if you can't do it, it's fine.
[00:54:15.174 --> 00:54:17.396]  We're going to break here in about five minutes.
[00:54:17.396 --> 00:54:20.440]  For one minute, can we have an extra additional five minutes with you?
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:21.462]  I'd be honored.
[00:54:21.462 --> 00:54:22.403]  And let me tell you something.
[00:54:23.232 --> 00:54:26.235]  I am concerned about you, but you're making one hell of an impact.
[00:54:41.168 --> 00:54:43.530]  And it came out the Delta Force was there.
[00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:51.058]  It was in Time Magazine that Israeli troops of all people and British troops were there.
[00:54:51.058 --> 00:54:54.982]  As a congressman who was there during those investigations, what's your intel on that?
[00:54:56.870 --> 00:55:06.634]  It was a joke, the way the mainstream media actually turned it around, where many Americans at their dinner table were saying, they got just what they deserved down there in Texas.
[00:55:06.634 --> 00:55:07.775]  My God, Alex.
[00:55:07.775 --> 00:55:12.757]  There were 17 kids incinerated, children incinerated in that building.
[00:55:12.757 --> 00:55:22.081]  I had seen films of it, where many of those guns and many of those heavy artillery was aimed right at the exit point, where no one was coming out of there.
[00:55:22.081 --> 00:55:25.082]  Look, Janet Reno and the Justice Department,
[00:55:26.528 --> 00:55:28.369]  Should have gone to prison over that.
[00:55:28.369 --> 00:55:29.730]  And another one that was very bad.
[00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:33.272]  Now, you're not a white supremacist, and you're not a racist.
[00:55:33.272 --> 00:55:33.733]  I know that.
[00:55:33.733 --> 00:55:41.297]  Neither am I. But this fellow, Randy Weaver, out there in Idaho, they shot his wife holding their infant child right between the eyes.
[00:55:41.297 --> 00:55:45.460]  A marksman killed a dog and killed his 14-year-old boy.
[00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:50.964]  I made a speech every week until they settled, and he ended up settling for about $5 million with the government.
[00:55:50.964 --> 00:55:51.764]  But they did that.
[00:55:53.928 --> 00:56:00.415]  They entangled that man because he was supposedly a white supremacist and was a political target of the United States government.
[00:56:00.415 --> 00:56:05.381]  Look, I'm not into any white supremacist, black supremacist, black bar business.
[00:56:05.381 --> 00:56:08.625]  I'm for a straight and honest American society.
[00:56:08.625 --> 00:56:13.190]  But regardless of what your politics are, I don't think that you should be singled out.
[00:56:13.530 --> 00:56:14.730]  Well, I know Weaver.
[00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:17.011]  He was former Special Forces.
[00:56:17.011 --> 00:56:19.532]  They wanted him to be an informant against the Aryan Nations.
[00:56:19.532 --> 00:56:21.753]  We'd only visited once.
[00:56:21.753 --> 00:56:24.553]  He was, quote, separating himself from society.
[00:56:24.553 --> 00:56:26.174]  None of that was even true.
[00:56:26.174 --> 00:56:29.535]  And when he wouldn't go be an informant for them, they went and did what they did.
[00:56:29.995 --> 00:56:30.856]  Yeah, it was a shame.
[00:56:30.856 --> 00:56:35.359]  What they did is they came to him and trapped him to cut the saw off two barrels off shotguns.
[00:56:35.359 --> 00:56:36.700]  He said, why don't you do it?
[00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:38.161]  They said, well, you know, we don't want to get into that.
[00:56:38.161 --> 00:56:39.042]  We don't know what we're doing.
[00:56:39.042 --> 00:56:40.443]  You know, you know what you're doing.
[00:56:40.443 --> 00:56:41.784]  And they entrapped the guy.
[00:56:41.784 --> 00:56:45.686]  But the way they come in with a SWAT team and the way they destroyed that family.
[00:56:45.686 --> 00:56:47.468]  But see, this is what America's not seeing.
[00:56:47.468 --> 00:56:50.029]  They're not seeing the other side of the one-eyed jack.
[00:56:50.029 --> 00:56:51.751]  Let me tell you something, Alex.
[00:56:51.751 --> 00:56:53.312]  And that's seven and a half years in prison.
[00:56:54.011 --> 00:56:57.902]  I'm probably more knowledgeable than anyone that ever served in Congress.
[00:56:57.902 --> 00:57:01.111]  That isn't self-serving, because I've seen the other side of this thing.
[00:57:01.938 --> 00:57:04.140]  See, I know what you're talking about.
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:07.262]  You're very unpopular in the nation's capital.
[00:57:07.262 --> 00:57:11.145]  But your popularity is growing because people know you're telling the truth.
[00:57:11.145 --> 00:57:16.569]  And you're touching subjects that people are afraid to even comment on.
[00:57:16.569 --> 00:57:17.870]  This is what bothers me.
[00:57:17.870 --> 00:57:19.891]  Do we have freedom of speech in America?
[00:57:19.891 --> 00:57:21.473]  Well, do we have mice or men?
[00:57:21.473 --> 00:57:24.775]  I mean, I'm not looking for trouble, but I can't control myself.
[00:57:24.775 --> 00:57:28.818]  When I see corruption and people being oppressed, I've got to stand up against it.
[00:57:28.818 --> 00:57:30.079]  And I, quite frankly, don't.
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:32.261]  Don't give a damn if they kill me.
[00:57:32.261 --> 00:57:34.402]  I don't want that to happen, but I'm committed.
[00:57:34.402 --> 00:57:35.603]  Well, let me tell you something.
[00:57:35.603 --> 00:57:42.346]  The truth of the matter is there are a lot of Americans like you, and they don't have the microphone, and they respect the hell out of you for it.
[00:57:42.346 --> 00:57:44.747]  That's why you have a tremendous responsibility.
[00:57:44.747 --> 00:57:48.789]  You have a tremendous responsibility with the pressure that you're going to be getting.
[00:57:48.789 --> 00:57:51.691]  And after having an interview with Jim Trafigan,
[00:57:52.211 --> 00:58:16.356]  My God, they're going to have their antenna up completely, but what I'm saying are things that I know that I've investigated myself, and when I brought a man home off a death row for mass murder, and Israel called me at my hotel in Jerusalem and said he'll be in Tel Aviv tomorrow night, Congressman, take him home, that tells you that I got the right information.
[00:58:16.356 --> 00:58:19.157]  And the government knew it, and then you're demonized
[00:58:20.237 --> 00:58:22.358]  And they set you up and put you in prison.
[00:58:22.358 --> 00:58:24.418]  We're going to come back.
[00:58:24.418 --> 00:58:25.439]  I'm sorry to the callers.
[00:58:25.439 --> 00:58:27.259]  It's just that all the info he keeps bringing out.
[00:58:27.259 --> 00:58:32.801]  I want to get every minute we can because he was in the middle of all of this in Congress for so long.
[00:58:32.801 --> 00:58:34.182]  But we'll see about going to your calls.
[00:58:34.182 --> 00:58:38.523]  Regardless, I'll get to him and come back after the congressman's left us in about eight minutes.
[00:58:38.523 --> 00:58:42.204]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[00:58:42.204 --> 00:58:44.705]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:44.705 --> 00:58:47.006]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:53.892]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:58:53.892 --> 00:59:00.295]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:59:00.295 --> 00:59:07.678]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:59:07.678 --> 00:59:12.560]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:59:14.181 --> 00:59:21.207]  By calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[00:59:21.207 --> 00:59:24.930]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:59:25.461 --> 00:59:32.248]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:59:32.248 --> 00:59:36.151]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:59:36.151 --> 00:59:42.498]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:59:42.498 --> 00:59:43.719]  Thank you.
[00:59:52.907 --> 00:59:55.309]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.309 --> 01:00:04.454]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.454 --> 01:00:05.755]  Big Brother.
[01:00:05.755 --> 01:00:07.536]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.536 --> 01:00:09.297]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.297 --> 01:00:10.878]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.878 --> 01:00:12.419]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.419 --> 01:00:16.621]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.621 --> 01:00:20.664]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.791 --> 01:00:33.753]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, and we're very honored to have Gerald Cilente, one of the top trends forecasters on the globe, with us for the next hour.
[01:00:33.753 --> 01:00:45.635]  He normally only can join us once a month because he's so busy doing international television and print interviews, but he's come back just after two weeks from the last visit because his prediction about Pakistani terror has come true.
[01:00:45.635 --> 01:00:51.396]  His prediction about massive riots intensifying that he made two years ago about Greece is now unfolding.
[01:00:52.242 --> 01:01:03.109]  His prediction about the plunging stock market is now unfolding, and another gentleman who's been right on target, Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster, he's joining us in one hour as well.
[01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:10.454]  Now, in the first hour, I did not get into what I believe went on yesterday, mainly because I'm still studying it.
[01:01:10.454 --> 01:01:14.777]  But I do agree with CNBC headline.
[01:01:14.777 --> 01:01:15.777]  That is ridiculous.
[01:01:15.777 --> 01:01:18.979]  This really sounds like market manipulation to me.
[01:01:18.979 --> 01:01:19.800]  Nine stocks
[01:01:22.415 --> 01:01:24.136]  Simultaneously went down.
[01:01:24.136 --> 01:01:25.978]  This was not some fat finger.
[01:01:25.978 --> 01:01:28.500]  We know the Plunge Protection Team manipulates the market.
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:32.663]  Now was this Europe plunging and their markets being closed triggering this?
[01:01:32.663 --> 01:01:42.371]  Or was this insider trading which we know the Major Trade Commission, the groups that are over the stock exchanges, I mean Madoff founded
[01:01:42.975 --> 01:01:43.716]  The Nasdaq.
[01:01:43.716 --> 01:01:51.001]  We know they're constantly involved in stuff like this, but they're getting really bold now if this is a premeditated fraud.
[01:01:51.001 --> 01:01:54.724]  We know they jacked the market back up almost a thousand points in just minutes.
[01:01:54.724 --> 01:01:55.484]  That's never happened.
[01:01:55.484 --> 01:01:58.106]  It's never dropped a thousand or been jacked up this fast.
[01:01:58.106 --> 01:01:59.307]  So we know there's manipulation.
[01:01:59.307 --> 01:02:01.489]  We know the story about fat fingers as a cover.
[01:02:01.929 --> 01:02:05.592]  But I don't know specifically yet exactly what happened.
[01:02:05.592 --> 01:02:08.614]  We know it's staged, we just don't know specifically why.
[01:02:08.614 --> 01:02:11.216]  We'll see if Gerald Cilente and Bob Chapman do.
[01:02:11.216 --> 01:02:13.498]  Gerald Cilente, good to have you here with us.
[01:02:13.498 --> 01:02:15.440]  Hey, thanks.
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:20.083]  Joining us via video Skype from New York State.
[01:02:20.083 --> 01:02:23.506]  Let's talk about what just happened with the stock market, then we'll get into Greece.
[01:02:24.949 --> 01:02:30.614]  Well, it's the crash of 2010, as we had forecast at the beginning of this year.
[01:02:30.614 --> 01:02:41.124]  And what's happening is the stimulus money is running out worldwide, and anytime that there's a trigger like Greece or something else, the market is going to decline.
[01:02:41.824 --> 01:02:45.506]  As you well pointed out, we know it's a rigged game.
[01:02:45.506 --> 01:02:51.188]  How it was rigged and who rigged it, that will never really get to the bottom of it.
[01:02:51.188 --> 01:02:53.409]  We never know the truth of those things.
[01:02:53.409 --> 01:02:57.110]  But I do believe that the market is unraveling.
[01:02:57.110 --> 01:03:05.534]  And what they did do yesterday is they came in and pulled out all the stops to jack it back up from not crashing.
[01:03:06.147 --> 01:03:09.990]  And they're going to do it for a number of days, and they're doing it globally.
[01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:12.572]  There's no stopping the meltdown.
[01:03:12.572 --> 01:03:20.057]  The markets collapsed, Alex, in March of 2009.
[01:03:20.057 --> 01:03:25.581]  What they did was they pumped them up with all of the stimulus money.
[01:03:25.581 --> 01:03:28.323]  It's as simple as that.
[01:03:28.323 --> 01:03:33.547]  It's all of Europe, the United States, the UK, India,
[01:03:34.944 --> 01:03:35.584]  China.
[01:03:35.584 --> 01:03:40.006]  China with its free lending policies and stimulus.
[01:03:40.006 --> 01:03:41.207]  Japan.
[01:03:41.207 --> 01:03:42.988]  South Korea.
[01:03:42.988 --> 01:03:44.248]  It's worldwide.
[01:03:44.248 --> 01:03:45.769]  Now it's running out.
[01:03:45.769 --> 01:03:50.151]  Just as we're seeing these phony unemployment numbers coming out.
[01:03:50.151 --> 01:03:53.853]  They're only juiced up by the stimulus money.
[01:03:53.853 --> 01:03:57.635]  When the stimulus runs out, the markets crash.
[01:03:57.635 --> 01:03:59.775]  The markets are now crashing now.
[01:03:59.775 --> 01:04:00.736]  So here's the game.
[01:04:01.653 --> 01:04:08.536]  The insider trading starts happening, the big guys start pulling it out because they know what's coming next.
[01:04:08.536 --> 01:04:24.424]  They jack it back up and then they get the shills out there to say, listen, this is a good buying opportunity, the market is only going through a correction, we have a lot of fundamental strength in the economy, and they sucker the people back in.
[01:04:25.069 --> 01:04:33.494]  So anyone that thinks that this is going to be a market that's going to grow in strength deserves what they get.
[01:04:33.494 --> 01:04:33.994]  All right, Gerald.
[01:04:33.994 --> 01:04:36.335]  Current events form future trends.
[01:04:36.335 --> 01:04:38.036]  Look at gold prices.
[01:04:38.036 --> 01:04:39.978]  How much are they up right now, Alex?
[01:04:39.978 --> 01:04:40.658]  They're up a lot.
[01:04:40.658 --> 01:04:42.799]  They're up 40-something bucks in the last two days.
[01:04:42.799 --> 01:04:44.320]  Gerald Cilente, stay there.
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:45.721]  We'll come right back to you after this break.
[01:04:46.121 --> 01:04:54.611]  I want you to recap and start over and go through your full prospectus of Meltdown 2010 that you've been predicting for the last year and a half.
[01:04:54.611 --> 01:04:59.717]  Carol Salente is our guest, Bob Chapman coming up as we cover every facet and angle of the situation.
[01:05:03.914 --> 01:05:05.154]  Tyranny is here.
[01:05:05.154 --> 01:05:09.035]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:05:09.035 --> 01:05:11.336]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:05:11.336 --> 01:05:17.197]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:05:17.197 --> 01:05:23.858]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:05:23.858 --> 01:05:29.839]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:05:29.839 --> 01:05:33.520]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:38.303]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:05:38.303 --> 01:05:44.267]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:05:44.267 --> 01:05:47.810]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:05:47.810 --> 01:05:49.791]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:05:49.791 --> 01:05:50.912]  It's here.

[01:07:42.242 --> 01:07:47.125]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:47.125 --> 01:07:49.026]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:22.783]  There have been new developments on the illegal aliens saying that citizens can't wear American flags in public schools and kids being suspended.
[01:08:22.783 --> 01:08:29.845]  The illegal aliens in San Francisco then marched the students in their anger over anyone dare wear an American flag.
[01:08:29.845 --> 01:08:31.346]  This is the Balkanization.
[01:08:31.346 --> 01:08:33.427]  We'll talk about that later.
[01:08:33.427 --> 01:08:36.688]  Gerald Salente, founder of the Friends Research Institute in 1980,
[01:08:38.061 --> 01:08:40.021]  He is a pioneer of trend strategy.
[01:08:40.021 --> 01:08:44.002]  He is the author of the national bestseller Trends 2000 and Trends Tracker.
[01:08:44.002 --> 01:08:50.723]  Warner Books, far better than Megatrends, is what the publisher of the internationally circulated trends journal newsletter.
[01:08:50.723 --> 01:08:51.803]  He's a political atheist.
[01:08:51.803 --> 01:08:57.664]  Gerald Salente is a political atheist, unencumbered by political dogma, rigid ideology, or conventional wisdom.
[01:08:57.664 --> 01:09:06.566]  Salente, whose motto is, think for yourself, observes and analyzes the current events forming trends, future trends for what they are, not for what he wants them to be.
[01:09:07.492 --> 01:09:07.893]  I don't know.
[01:09:22.472 --> 01:09:29.858]  When we have somebody like Willie Nelson on, or Jesse Ventura, the most popular guest that we have on this radio show, and we're very honored to have him.
[01:09:29.858 --> 01:09:32.720]  Okay, some stations just joined us, Gerald Cilente.
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:34.682]  Breakdown with your info.
[01:09:34.682 --> 01:09:36.323]  What happened with the market yesterday?
[01:09:36.323 --> 01:09:37.604]  You predicted.
[01:09:38.696 --> 01:09:42.598]  Three years ago, the stock market plunge of 2008, a year and a half before.
[01:09:42.598 --> 01:09:45.340]  A year and a half before what happened in Greece.
[01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:48.742]  You predicted it would start in Greece, Portugal, Spain.
[01:09:48.742 --> 01:09:52.704]  Now they're saying England has as big a debt ratio, so does the U.S.
[01:09:52.704 --> 01:09:54.625]  They're announcing a global implosion.
[01:09:54.625 --> 01:10:00.248]  The banks, we know, are engineering this and hijacking countries.
[01:10:00.248 --> 01:10:05.631]  So break down where you see this going and what's happening with the markets and the next shoe to drop.
[01:10:06.874 --> 01:10:12.359]  Well, the next shooter drop appears to be happening again in Europe.
[01:10:12.359 --> 01:10:20.467]  First of all, what's going on in Greece is going to explode into social unrest worldwide.
[01:10:20.467 --> 01:10:23.230]  The people are not going to take it.
[01:10:23.230 --> 01:10:26.253]  I love the white shoe boy language they use.
[01:10:26.932 --> 01:10:36.260]  The average person has to suffer through their austerity measures so they could bail out... Who is it that's holding the bonds?
[01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:39.863]  It's these huge hedge funds and banks.
[01:10:39.863 --> 01:10:43.686]  They can't give them, here's their language, a haircut.
[01:10:44.332 --> 01:10:46.353]  What do you mean you can't give them a haircut?
[01:10:46.353 --> 01:10:48.713]  Oh no, they won't even get a trim.
[01:10:48.713 --> 01:10:50.754]  You have to cover the losses.
[01:10:50.754 --> 01:10:56.536]  In the United States, the people accept that a lot quicker than they do in Europe.
[01:10:56.536 --> 01:11:00.857]  The Europeans know the story and they're not going to let it happen.
[01:11:00.857 --> 01:11:02.777]  The next shooter fall?
[01:11:02.777 --> 01:11:07.179]  Probably Spain, Portugal, then Italy.
[01:11:07.179 --> 01:11:09.839]  The UK is in terrible trouble.
[01:11:09.839 --> 01:11:11.660]  We're going to see sovereign
[01:11:12.395 --> 01:11:15.316]  Defaults around the world.
[01:11:15.316 --> 01:11:18.378]  It's happened before and it's happened again.
[01:11:18.378 --> 01:11:21.299]  Let's make this 100% clear.
[01:11:21.299 --> 01:11:26.361]  The only people that are getting bailed out are the two bigs.
[01:11:26.361 --> 01:11:29.222]  They're not allowed to lose any money.
[01:11:29.222 --> 01:11:37.126]  Always under the guise that if we lose money, the whole world system will collapse.
[01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:41.728]  It's kind of like Alex, did you hear President Obama recently
[01:11:42.512 --> 01:11:51.438]  When he addressed the Wall Street crowd a couple of weeks ago, he called them the titans of industry.
[01:11:51.438 --> 01:11:53.659]  What industry?
[01:11:53.659 --> 01:11:55.680]  They're not making cars.
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:59.403]  They're not producing steel or building railroads.
[01:11:59.403 --> 01:12:02.305]  The only thing they make are profits.
[01:12:02.305 --> 01:12:04.686]  And they're not titans of industry.
[01:12:04.686 --> 01:12:05.987]  You know who they are?
[01:12:05.987 --> 01:12:07.528]  They're bookies.
[01:12:07.528 --> 01:12:08.949]  Call it what it is.
[01:12:08.949 --> 01:12:10.550]  But they're super bookies.
[01:12:11.161 --> 01:12:19.123]  These are guys that not only are touts at the racetrack, they also field the horses.
[01:12:19.123 --> 01:12:22.404]  Thoroughbreds that are really nags.
[01:12:22.404 --> 01:12:24.464]  Credit default swap.
[01:12:24.464 --> 01:12:26.785]  Auction rate security.
[01:12:26.785 --> 01:12:28.585]  That's all they are.
[01:12:28.585 --> 01:12:31.086]  Synthetic credit default swaps.
[01:12:31.886 --> 01:12:34.729]  Special investment vehicles.
[01:12:34.729 --> 01:12:48.644]  The whole fraudulent system is collapsing and the governments are going to crack down on the little people so they can pay off the gambling debts made by the big losses.
[01:12:48.644 --> 01:12:49.205]  Number two.
[01:12:50.231 --> 01:12:55.894]  As the markets collapse, what they're going to do, the big guys are going to bail out.
[01:12:55.894 --> 01:13:01.298]  As I have mentioned, what they'll say is that the markets are rebounding.
[01:13:01.298 --> 01:13:03.199]  I can't make this stuff up.
[01:13:03.199 --> 01:13:09.783]  As I said to you just several minutes earlier, they're going to say, this is a good buying opportunity.
[01:13:09.783 --> 01:13:17.887]  Well, between the time I said that and the break that happened to now, I just heard the clowns on CNBC say,
[01:13:19.486 --> 01:13:25.512]  It's a great buying opportunity to jump into the stock markets in Europe.
[01:13:25.512 --> 01:13:26.493]  Oh yeah!
[01:13:26.493 --> 01:13:30.697]  It's a great opportunity to jump onto the Lusitania.
[01:13:30.697 --> 01:13:34.621]  It's gonna have a lovely trip across the ocean.
[01:13:34.621 --> 01:13:40.787]  Anybody that buys into the markets or that buys into these lies deserves what they get.
[01:13:44.266 --> 01:13:47.307]  Gerald, I'm just speechless here as you go over this.
[01:13:47.307 --> 01:13:52.347]  I mean, we have the Goldman Sachs internal emails, we have the JP Morgan internal info.
[01:13:52.347 --> 01:14:09.831]  They premeditatedly, going back four years ago, sold government, sold pension funds, sold private individuals, derivatives that they knew were worthless, while they were preparing to bet against them, and in their own emails they say, this will destroy our competition.
[01:14:09.831 --> 01:14:12.351]  But the media is only focusing on the Timberwolf emails,
[01:14:13.031 --> 01:14:15.812]  With Goldman Sachs, when the others are far worse.
[01:14:15.812 --> 01:14:20.313]  And now they're announcing, don't worry, we're engaged in financial terrorism.
[01:14:20.313 --> 01:14:25.775]  Give us unlimited trillions and we'll bring back the good times.
[01:14:25.775 --> 01:14:30.336]  But then separately, two weeks ago in the Washington Post, the head of the IMF bragged.
[01:14:30.336 --> 01:14:35.217]  He said, for rich nations, this was the headline, the good times are over.
[01:14:35.217 --> 01:14:36.178]  The party's over.
[01:14:36.178 --> 01:14:37.438]  You're not going to be able to retire.
[01:14:38.098 --> 01:14:39.661]  We're going to take your pension funds.
[01:14:39.661 --> 01:14:41.784]  They're getting ready for it here.
[01:14:41.784 --> 01:14:44.147]  Our media won't say why the Greeks are rioting.
[01:14:44.147 --> 01:14:45.769]  They just say austerity.
[01:14:45.769 --> 01:14:52.298]  But when we talk about austerity, Gerald Solente, explain to people what austerity means under these Madoff types.
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:15:11.325]  Well, what it means is that everybody's standard of living declines, they tax you to death, they make it more and more impossible for small people to get into businesses because they put more and more charges on top of them, and direct all the business to the big guys.
[01:15:11.325 --> 01:15:15.627]  Let's make this really clear about this bailout going to Greece.
[01:15:15.627 --> 01:15:16.327]  Number one,
[01:15:17.518 --> 01:15:24.162]  It's against the European Monetary Union Charter for any bailouts.
[01:15:24.162 --> 01:15:32.327]  Number two, it's explicitly against the European Monetary Union Charter for an IMF bailout.
[01:15:32.327 --> 01:15:35.929]  Who's the biggest funder of the IMF?
[01:15:35.929 --> 01:15:36.589]  Us.
[01:15:36.589 --> 01:15:39.050]  We, the people of the United States.
[01:15:39.050 --> 01:15:41.732]  We're the people that are now bailing out
[01:15:42.253 --> 01:15:50.623]  The banks, the JPMorgan Chase, the Goldman Sachs gang, the Merrill Lynch mob, the Credit Suisse.
[01:15:50.623 --> 01:15:53.226]  Where is all this money going to?
[01:15:53.226 --> 01:15:55.148]  It's going to the bankers.
[01:15:55.148 --> 01:15:59.554]  Number one, it's against the economic, the European Monetary Union.
[01:15:59.554 --> 01:16:02.357]  And number two, now we're footing the bill
[01:16:02.737 --> 01:16:04.939]  So these guys can get bailed out.
[01:16:04.939 --> 01:16:12.604]  What you're seeing happening in Greece, with the people taking to the streets, is going to happen worldwide.
[01:16:12.604 --> 01:16:14.185]  I want to make this very clear.
[01:16:15.362 --> 01:16:22.669]  Because, Alex, this is going to lead, one of the elements, leading to the Great War.
[01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:25.611]  Systems are going to be breaking down.
[01:16:25.611 --> 01:16:31.517]  They're not going to be able to stop the people any more than they're able to stop them in Thailand.
[01:16:31.517 --> 01:16:33.618]  Thailand hardly makes the news.
[01:16:33.618 --> 01:16:36.321]  People don't know anything of what's going on there.
[01:16:36.321 --> 01:16:38.463]  You've heard me say this over and over again.
[01:16:38.942 --> 01:16:46.808]  My expression as a Bronx guy is when people lose everything and they have nothing left to lose, they're losing it.
[01:16:46.808 --> 01:16:58.037]  And they're going to be losing it against the red carpet crowd who believe that they are the entitled people, that they could fix everything if only you give them anything.
[01:16:58.037 --> 01:16:59.117]  Everything.
[01:16:59.117 --> 01:17:04.942]  And I want to add something to that because the magnitude of this fraud with banker bailouts, they're not bailouts.
[01:17:04.942 --> 01:17:07.143]  They make money on the way up selling the crud.
[01:17:07.964 --> 01:17:25.616]  Then when the governments and companies and pension funds that have bought the fraud start imploding, the government gives taxpayer money as a bailout to the private banks that engineered the fraud to then lend the money to the government
[01:17:26.391 --> 01:17:33.474]  Or to the pension fund that's now bankrupt, and then now those pension funds are even in more debt to the same bankers that engineered it.
[01:17:33.474 --> 01:17:41.238]  So to quantify this, we loan the banks the money that they then loan us back.
[01:17:41.238 --> 01:17:48.721]  I mean, this is fraud on top of fraud on top of fraud, and you notice that as soon as they agreed to the $146.5 billion for Greece, that suddenly
[01:17:53.905 --> 01:18:23.665]  Portugal and Spain started going under because the bank said look they bought this now Let's trigger it here, and so they're holding all of us hostage, and they own the mainstream media And so the mainstream media most the time will not tell the truth Dylan Rattigan does occasionally they let Ron Paul on sometimes to tell the truth But I mean here's the Washington Post headline For nations living the good life the party is over IMF says Washington Post, but I mean going back to that the level of
[01:18:27.526 --> 01:18:29.706]  Wow, that was crazy.
[01:18:29.706 --> 01:18:32.427]  That sounded like one of those party horns.
[01:18:32.427 --> 01:18:34.868]  I guess we lost Gerald Cilente.
[01:18:34.868 --> 01:18:37.608]  That happens occasionally with the video Skype connections.
[01:18:37.608 --> 01:18:45.150]  So we're going to connect back to Gerald Cilente and continue along those lines with our guest today.
[01:18:45.150 --> 01:18:47.471]  Special effects brought to you by Skype, I guess.
[01:18:47.471 --> 01:18:48.051]  We have Gerald back.
[01:18:49.844 --> 01:18:50.184]  We don't?
[01:18:50.184 --> 01:18:56.190]  Okay, we're going to go to break in a moment, and I'm going to bring that question back to him after the break.
[01:18:56.190 --> 01:19:04.117]  It isn't just that the banks sell derivatives and then the economy implodes, and then we have to bail the nations out.
[01:19:04.117 --> 01:19:06.259]  When you read about this Greek plan, or the U.S.
[01:19:06.259 --> 01:19:08.942]  plan, or what happened in England in the last wave,
[01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:13.912]  Our money then goes to the banks.
[01:19:13.912 --> 01:19:15.453]  Gerald, you got cut off.
[01:19:15.453 --> 01:19:21.298]  We're going to break, but start answering the question about how we loan them our money to loan back to us.
[01:19:21.298 --> 01:19:24.301]  Yeah, but you see, you left one element out, Alex.
[01:19:24.301 --> 01:19:26.243]  You have to be fair about this.
[01:19:26.243 --> 01:19:32.748]  They give the government all of their toxic crap as collateral.
[01:19:32.748 --> 01:19:36.732]  That's what they use as the sham to make it legitimate.
[01:19:37.384 --> 01:19:39.265]  And that's what's been going on.
[01:19:39.265 --> 01:19:55.909]  The governments around the world have been using this lie that they have collateral, so that they could then loan the banks money at near zero interest rates, so that the banks could go back out, reloan it to us, and continuing their gamble.
[01:19:55.909 --> 01:19:57.629]  Alright, stay there, we gotta go to break.
[01:19:57.629 --> 01:19:59.450]  So you're right, it's even worse than I was saying.
[01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:05.184]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[01:21:59.249 --> 01:22:03.372]  Are you tired of out-of-control, irresponsible federal deficit spending?
[01:22:03.372 --> 01:22:07.636]  Increasing the money supply without increasing productive output leads to inflation.
[01:22:07.636 --> 01:22:09.217]  You get less for your money.
[01:22:09.217 --> 01:22:15.042]  If you want to protect the buying power of dollars for your future, then call Peter May at Midas Resources.
[01:22:16.003 --> 01:22:20.006]  800-686-2237 extension 135.

[01:22:24.931 --> 01:22:28.034]  Gold has a 5,000 year track record as money.
[01:22:28.034 --> 01:22:29.655]  Real money you can count on.
[01:22:29.655 --> 01:22:32.538]  No government-backed paper currency comes close.
[01:22:32.538 --> 01:22:35.120]  Ask me about the protection of private gold.
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:37.782]  Call Peter May at Midas Resources 800-686-2237.
[01:22:38.863 --> 01:22:39.344]  We're good.
[01:23:00.074 --> 01:23:00.815]  The problem.
[01:23:00.815 --> 01:23:03.397]  How do I cook food without power?
[01:23:03.397 --> 01:23:06.120]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:08.783]  How do I get emergency radio broadcast?
[01:23:08.783 --> 01:23:11.285]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[01:23:11.285 --> 01:23:20.054]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio, and producing clean water is the Family Emergency Kit from KaroStove.

[01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:58.022]  KeroStove, for family emergency solutions.
[01:24:04.676 --> 01:24:06.360]  All right, we got cut off by the break.
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:10.550]  Gerald Cilente, TrendsResearch.com, an invaluable website.
[01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:11.271]  Check it out today.
[01:24:11.271 --> 01:24:13.937]  Our websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:24:16.613 --> 01:24:23.439]  I want to take a few calls before Gerald Cilente leaves us, but they have to be questions specifically, quick questions for Gerald Cilente.
[01:24:23.439 --> 01:24:30.225]  But we love the directions, you know, the spin-the-wheel directions that people take us in, the different angles that we wouldn't have thought of.
[01:24:30.225 --> 01:24:31.526]  I want to pick his brain here today.
[01:24:31.526 --> 01:24:31.786]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:24:31.786 --> 01:24:31.986]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:24:31.986 --> 01:24:33.347]  But Gerald, you make a great point.
[01:24:33.347 --> 01:24:33.768]  I can't even
[01:24:42.807 --> 01:24:43.127]  I think?
[01:25:02.965 --> 01:25:03.505]  That's right.
[01:25:03.505 --> 01:25:05.727]  And let's not forget the rating agencies, as you mentioned.
[01:25:05.727 --> 01:25:07.467]  You know, they get a free ride as well.
[01:25:07.467 --> 01:25:09.949]  They're getting paid to rate the junk, and they rate the junk excellent.
[01:25:09.949 --> 01:25:11.390]  You can't get away with this in real life.
[01:25:31.894 --> 01:25:35.056]  And I've said this over and over again.
[01:25:35.056 --> 01:25:38.919]  The merger of state and corporate powers is called fascism.
[01:25:38.919 --> 01:25:41.300]  And fascism has come to America.
[01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:43.782]  We're talking about the financial sector.
[01:25:43.782 --> 01:25:46.383]  We could talk about it in agriculture.
[01:25:46.383 --> 01:25:49.145]  We could talk about it in pharmaceutical.
[01:25:49.145 --> 01:25:51.847]  We could talk about it in retail.
[01:25:51.847 --> 01:25:56.250]  Every sector of this country is controlled by a handful.
[01:25:56.250 --> 01:25:58.171]  What is it, Alex?
[01:25:58.171 --> 01:26:00.272]  Six banks controlling 60%
[01:26:02.125 --> 01:26:05.510]  of all of the action in the country.
[01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:08.515]  How can you deny what's going on?
[01:26:08.515 --> 01:26:09.917]  You can't.
[01:26:09.917 --> 01:26:12.060]  This is not socialism.
[01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:15.145]  And I heard you talking about before I came on the air.
[01:26:15.692 --> 01:26:37.863]  about these drug busts and how they use these fascist tactics to beat up people, to beat up the little guy for, you know, smoking a joint, while they let the big guys free and turn, quote, a blind eye to opium production in Afghanistan because they don't want to hurt the family farmer's income.
[01:26:37.863 --> 01:26:39.744]  Who are they kidding with this stuff?
[01:26:39.744 --> 01:26:41.185]  So what we're looking at
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:44.588]  is really a complete takeover.
[01:26:44.588 --> 01:26:48.981]  And when people say, why isn't the government doing anything?
[01:26:50.029 --> 01:26:52.310]  They think that there's a revolving door.
[01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:54.530]  That's the story that they've been fed.
[01:26:54.530 --> 01:27:02.472]  Well, you know, the people who go out of government and then into these private corporations and they, you know, they have an inside track.
[01:27:02.472 --> 01:27:04.653]  It's not a revolving door.
[01:27:04.653 --> 01:27:06.954]  It's a wide open door.
[01:27:06.954 --> 01:27:12.115]  And that door is filled with the same people in every agency.
[01:27:12.577 --> 01:27:15.601]  That are fronting for the big corporations.
[01:27:15.601 --> 01:27:20.167]  Whether it's the Goldman Sachs gang, or whether it's agriculture.
[01:27:20.167 --> 01:27:22.911]  It's the same story over and over again.
[01:27:23.683 --> 01:27:25.765]  Well, look at Walmart globally.
[01:27:25.765 --> 01:27:30.910]  It has 46% of all retail sales, and it's all based on Chinese slave goods.
[01:27:30.910 --> 01:27:31.971]  What about Mark Fobber?
[01:27:31.971 --> 01:27:33.273]  I know you respect his opinion.
[01:27:33.273 --> 01:27:40.580]  He's got a very good track record of predicting things just in the markets, so you have, you know, general analysis, which is so important.
[01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:47.767]  But he's saying 90% chance in the next 9 to 12 months that China will completely collapse into depression.
[01:27:48.849 --> 01:27:50.370]  Oh, we've been saying this as well.
[01:27:50.370 --> 01:27:52.111]  It's the Chinese bubble.
[01:27:52.111 --> 01:28:06.179]  Everyone knows that one of the major reasons why we have recovered with this fake recovery from the March 2009 equities market collapse is because of China.
[01:28:06.179 --> 01:28:12.603]  And China has dumped in nearly a trillion dollars worth of money, plus they're loaning out money all over.
[01:28:12.603 --> 01:28:15.645]  They have a huge housing bubble going on there.
[01:28:16.044 --> 01:28:22.469]  And I do respect Mark Farber's analysis, as Bob Chapman's as well.
[01:28:22.469 --> 01:28:27.914]  And Farber's right on the money with this, because there's another problem going on in China.
[01:28:27.914 --> 01:28:34.819]  And again, this is where we look at a bit differently than a lot of others, and that is the social unrest.
[01:28:34.819 --> 01:28:41.765]  They've had over 70,000 major riots and disturbances in China in 2009.
[01:28:44.249 --> 01:28:52.891]  They have to keep their 1.2 billion people happy, because if they don't, the whole thing turns to chaos.
[01:28:52.891 --> 01:29:01.833]  And it's going to be chaos in China, as the world economies decline, and they have no place to dump their product.
[01:29:01.833 --> 01:29:06.114]  So yes, we agree, there's going to be a major unraveling in China.
[01:29:07.372 --> 01:29:08.372]  Now, we're about to break.
[01:29:08.372 --> 01:29:09.333]  Long segment coming up.
[01:29:09.333 --> 01:29:11.934]  We'll take some calls and get into other trends.
[01:29:11.934 --> 01:29:17.155]  But I've got a Twitter question to the Real Alex Jones Twitter by Ferreira.
[01:29:17.155 --> 01:29:22.357]  It says, I'd like to know if he has the same forecast for financial collapse that he had one year ago.
[01:29:22.357 --> 01:29:25.098]  Have things changed or have things accelerated?
[01:29:25.098 --> 01:29:28.659]  Well, let me just answer that question and then have him come back and elaborate.
[01:29:28.659 --> 01:29:33.361]  He said almost four years ago that in 2008 there'd be a huge implosion.
[01:29:33.361 --> 01:29:34.001]  That's on record.
[01:29:34.481 --> 01:29:38.004]  And he described it in the subprime mortgages as the trigger.
[01:29:38.004 --> 01:29:47.932]  Then he said right after the bailout in 2008 that 2010, and Chapman said this too, that the money would run out and then the big implosion would start.
[01:29:47.932 --> 01:29:50.454]  We'll be back.
[01:29:50.454 --> 01:29:51.855]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.855 --> 01:29:54.397]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.397 --> 01:29:57.080]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.767 --> 01:30:07.769]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoodsDirect was putting together a high-volume, pre-production order of the new Quick Fix meals.
[01:30:07.769 --> 01:30:15.110]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive one free item for every three that they bought.
[01:30:15.110 --> 01:30:22.092]  Since the final shutdown of this buy three, get one free program, we've had a lot of folks calling, disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[01:30:22.092 --> 01:30:22.932]  Listen carefully.
[01:30:23.332 --> 01:30:33.038]  Starting immediately, eFoodsDirect.com will take pre-production orders for a buy three get one free program for one week ending May 14th at midnight.
[01:30:33.038 --> 01:30:37.280]  You will receive one free item for every three that you order of the selected products.
[01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:40.282]  These orders will begin shipping the first week of June.
[01:30:40.282 --> 01:30:44.445]  To order on the web, eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633.
[01:30:44.445 --> 01:30:45.405]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[01:30:50.828 --> 01:30:52.990]  800-409-5633.
[01:30:52.990 --> 01:30:58.774]  Again, that's efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[01:30:58.774 --> 01:30:59.514]  800-409-5633.
[01:30:59.514 --> 01:31:00.815]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:00.815 --> 01:31:06.399]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:31:06.399 --> 01:31:11.442]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:31:11.442 --> 01:31:16.466]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:31:16.986 --> 01:31:22.232]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:31:22.232 --> 01:31:29.340]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:30.461]  And here's the best part.
[01:31:30.461 --> 01:31:36.828]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:31:37.128 --> 01:31:40.311]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:40.311 --> 01:31:42.553]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:42.553 --> 01:31:43.494]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:31:43.494 --> 01:31:43.814]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:31:43.814 --> 01:31:47.117]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:31:47.117 --> 01:31:48.859]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:59.326 --> 01:32:00.968]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[01:32:54.079 --> 01:32:54.780]  This is the end
[01:33:10.634 --> 01:33:13.895]  Well, this is Fitting Music with Gerald Cilente on with us.
[01:33:13.895 --> 01:33:20.497]  I want to be specific with him in a moment and get into the next phase in the collapse.
[01:33:20.497 --> 01:33:23.398]  How he sees this historically unwinding and unfolding.
[01:33:23.398 --> 01:33:28.260]  Bob Chapman will also join us next hour to specifically burrow in to his research.
[01:33:28.260 --> 01:33:31.361]  I know he's on it to find out exactly what happened yesterday.
[01:33:31.361 --> 01:33:35.022]  The word is there was a lot of people that were short on gold in Europe.
[01:33:35.660 --> 01:33:40.083]  That they had to dump stock to be able to cover their position.
[01:33:40.083 --> 01:33:41.585]  We know it wasn't a fat finger.
[01:33:41.585 --> 01:33:43.066]  It wasn't Procter & Gamble.
[01:33:43.066 --> 01:33:44.927]  That's even CNBC admits.
[01:33:44.927 --> 01:33:50.652]  It was at least nine stocks simultaneously that did this and they halted trading in Europe.
[01:33:50.652 --> 01:33:52.353]  A lot of chicanery.
[01:33:52.353 --> 01:33:56.656]  We have a specialist on that issue alone, Bob Chapman, joining us next hour.
[01:33:56.656 --> 01:34:03.902]  Before we go back to our guest, we produced and released two new films in the month of April.
[01:34:03.902 --> 01:34:04.382]  I released
[01:34:05.209 --> 01:34:31.383]  Of course, Invisible Empire, New World Order Defined, which is just excellent, exposing the New World Order, the global government, who these people are, how to stop them, government drug dealing, government kidnapping, white slavery, how they're bribing people, how they're controlling them, what the banks are doing, and Police State 4, the rise of FEMA, how they're planning to suppress the people, trying to take on the Tea Parties, training the military to take on the American people, the reality of the FEMA camps.
[01:34:31.383 --> 01:34:33.324]  It's all proven in Police State 4, the rise of FEMA.
[01:34:33.844 --> 01:34:39.207]  But remember William Lewis, who made Camp FEMA and a lot of other great films with Gary Franchi.
[01:34:39.207 --> 01:34:40.807]  They have released a new film.
[01:34:40.807 --> 01:34:42.148]  I've got it here in stock.
[01:34:42.148 --> 01:34:45.069]  We can't start shipping it until the 16th or 17th.
[01:34:45.069 --> 01:34:47.771]  It officially comes out the 17th, but that's just a week away.
[01:34:47.771 --> 01:34:50.712]  A little more than a week away, about 8-9 days away.
[01:34:50.712 --> 01:34:56.775]  If you want it first, we're going to ship this out UPS or Postal Service, however you order it, and your purchase supports us.
[01:34:56.775 --> 01:34:58.936]  But that's not what's important here.
[01:34:58.936 --> 01:35:00.557]  That's not what's important.
[01:35:00.557 --> 01:35:01.497]  Okay?
[01:35:01.497 --> 01:35:02.898]  Supporting us is secondary.
[01:35:03.587 --> 01:35:08.789]  This film exposes the 9th and 10th Amendment powers, the states' rights rebellion.
[01:35:08.789 --> 01:35:16.972]  In fact, I have the Republican Party calling for basically the states to say no to the New World Order today, and starting a states' rights task force.
[01:35:16.972 --> 01:35:18.393]  The point is, I'm in there.
[01:35:20.109 --> 01:35:27.872]  Michael Bagnerik, Dr. Edwin Vieira, so many other great political minds about how to take the states back.
[01:35:27.872 --> 01:35:33.013]  This is a key handbook so people know the difference between a democracy and a constitutional republic.
[01:35:33.013 --> 01:35:34.534]  This is such an important film.
[01:35:34.534 --> 01:35:36.514]  Don't tread on me.
[01:35:36.514 --> 01:35:39.255]  You can pre-order it now at InfoWars.com.
[01:35:39.255 --> 01:35:44.157]  You can also watch the newest trailer because William Lewis has authorized us to make a
[01:35:44.377 --> 01:35:44.537]  Yeah.
[01:36:00.855 --> 01:36:03.036]  Now available at InfoWars.com.
[01:36:03.036 --> 01:36:06.639]  The people know there's a problem, but they don't understand the full magnitude of it.
[01:36:06.639 --> 01:36:11.141]  So get it at InfoWars.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:36:11.141 --> 01:36:11.822]  888-253-3139.
[01:36:11.822 --> 01:36:19.926]  And I want to thank all of you for your support of the online video bookstore.
[01:36:19.926 --> 01:36:21.247]  Okay, going back to Gerald Cilente.
[01:36:21.247 --> 01:36:26.410]  Gerald, I want to rapid-fire ask you questions and have you finish the Twitter question we mentioned before the break.
[01:36:26.410 --> 01:36:27.331]  But before we do that,
[01:36:27.771 --> 01:36:29.052]  Information is power.
[01:36:29.052 --> 01:36:32.195]  Christ said the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[01:36:32.195 --> 01:36:34.117]  We're here to try to give them the knowledge.
[01:36:34.117 --> 01:36:40.443]  The guests I have on this show are the people that are consistently right, not the people that are consistently wrong.
[01:36:40.443 --> 01:36:41.825]  The people that will tell the truth.
[01:36:41.825 --> 01:36:44.828]  The people that are constitutionalists, like yourself,
[01:36:45.428 --> 01:36:50.149]  And your Trends Journal is invaluable.
[01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:55.031]  Many of the biggest corporations on earth you've consulted for and subscribed to it.
[01:36:55.031 --> 01:36:57.452]  The people need the Trends Journal.
[01:36:57.452 --> 01:36:59.292]  How do folks get it?
[01:36:59.292 --> 01:37:01.413]  Trendsresearch.com.
[01:37:01.413 --> 01:37:03.834]  Trendsresearch.com.
[01:37:03.834 --> 01:37:09.555]  And I also want to make it very clear that we know these are difficult times for a lot of people.
[01:37:09.555 --> 01:37:12.056]  So we have a discount request form.
[01:37:12.831 --> 01:37:18.199]  And we try to make it available to everyone, students, unemployed.
[01:37:18.199 --> 01:37:23.307]  Just tell us what your situation is and we'll do our best to help you out.
[01:37:23.307 --> 01:37:26.131]  Absolutely, and again, give that website out one more time.
[01:37:26.897 --> 01:37:29.198]  TrendsResearch.com.
[01:37:29.198 --> 01:37:31.659]  That's with an S, plural, Trends Research.
[01:37:31.659 --> 01:37:41.443]  Okay, Bob Chapman's coming up, and I want to try to keep you five minutes to the next hour, so we have every second we can with you now to go through calls and Twitter questions.
[01:37:41.443 --> 01:37:47.325]  But going back to this first Twitter question that I posed as we went to break,
[01:37:47.984 --> 01:37:53.506]  I'd like to know if he has the same forecast for financial collapse that he had one year ago.
[01:37:53.506 --> 01:37:54.546]  Have things changed?
[01:37:54.546 --> 01:37:59.948]  So, you've been dead on about exactly what would happen, even the countries where it would start.
[01:37:59.948 --> 01:38:03.509]  Do you want to revise that any, because you have new info?
[01:38:03.509 --> 01:38:06.791]  And then I will add the caveat, the proviso.
[01:38:06.791 --> 01:38:09.191]  And what do you see coming in the year after that?
[01:38:09.191 --> 01:38:10.792]  What comes next?
[01:38:10.792 --> 01:38:11.812]  Here it is.
[01:38:11.812 --> 01:38:15.154]  This came out when it was released in January 13th.
[01:38:15.154 --> 01:38:16.214]  The top trend.
[01:38:17.247 --> 01:38:18.248]  The crash of 2010.
[01:38:18.248 --> 01:38:21.990]  We stick with our forecast.
[01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:30.236]  Before the new year begins, no one will be able to deny that the great equity markets have crashed.
[01:38:30.236 --> 01:38:34.679]  The currencies are being devalued around the world.
[01:38:34.679 --> 01:38:39.202]  Gold prices are well over $1,500.
[01:38:39.202 --> 01:38:45.446]  We are sticking with our forecast that the markets will crash before the year is out.
[01:38:46.061 --> 01:38:49.104]  And I also want to make this very clear.
[01:38:49.104 --> 01:38:52.546]  It's not only going to be a financial crash.
[01:38:52.546 --> 01:38:55.869]  It's going to come from a lot of different directions.
[01:38:55.869 --> 01:39:08.059]  Our greatest fear, and we've said this when they began the great bailout bubble in March of 2009, is that when all else fails, they take you to war.
[01:39:08.059 --> 01:39:11.602]  So what we, our scenario is this, Alex.
[01:39:11.602 --> 01:39:15.125]  We're going to see 9-11 magnitude terror strikes happen.
[01:39:15.922 --> 01:39:25.008]  When they happen, the last time they happened after 2001, they closed Wall Street down for several days.
[01:39:25.008 --> 01:39:28.611]  If you had CDs, you couldn't cash them in.
[01:39:28.611 --> 01:39:30.853]  They're financial instruments.
[01:39:30.853 --> 01:39:34.055]  This time, they're going to close the banks.
[01:39:34.055 --> 01:39:41.280]  And when they reopen the banks, we forecast they will have devalued the dollar.
[01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:42.801]  So they'll say, don't worry about it.
[01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:49.771]  You'll be able to get your money out, it's backed by the FDIC, but you can't get it out all at once.
[01:39:49.771 --> 01:39:54.953]  And when you do get it out, it's not going to be worth a fraction of what it was before.
[01:39:54.953 --> 01:40:04.576]  So these are the integrated systems that we're looking at, and I'm saying this so that people take proactive measures now.
[01:40:04.576 --> 01:40:12.118]  Don't wait to wake up one day, as you did yesterday, and see the markets collapse around you.
[01:40:12.751 --> 01:40:14.733]  Take proactive measures now.
[01:40:14.733 --> 01:40:16.776]  It doesn't cost anything.
[01:40:16.776 --> 01:40:23.363]  But if you don't plan for the worst now, and the worst happens, then you'll lose everything.
[01:40:23.363 --> 01:40:29.931]  If you take measures now, and things happen slowly, you haven't lost anything you've gained.
[01:40:30.811 --> 01:40:31.552]  So what do we do?
[01:40:31.552 --> 01:40:33.093]  Get a lot of our money out of the bank.
[01:40:33.093 --> 01:40:35.255]  Most people don't even have any money to get out of the bank.
[01:40:35.255 --> 01:40:35.735]  What do you do?
[01:40:35.735 --> 01:40:46.044]  Get some storable food, water, get a second job now so you're ready for what's coming, warn your neighbors so they'll have some respect for you and listen to you when all this comes true.
[01:40:46.044 --> 01:40:48.846]  I mean, what do we do, Gerald?
[01:40:48.846 --> 01:40:49.887]  Well, all of those things.
[01:40:49.887 --> 01:40:51.168]  Number one, about the neighbors.
[01:40:51.940 --> 01:40:54.641]  Like-minded people, forming groups.
[01:40:54.641 --> 01:40:59.404]  In the event the worst happens, then you have a strategy and a plan.
[01:40:59.404 --> 01:41:01.045]  You can work together.
[01:41:01.045 --> 01:41:02.726]  It's the community.
[01:41:02.726 --> 01:41:03.466]  Keep your money.
[01:41:03.466 --> 01:41:10.450]  Don't spend a dime you don't have to spend, especially on junk and eating crappy food.
[01:41:10.450 --> 01:41:12.491]  Cook your own, make it better.
[01:41:12.491 --> 01:41:17.253]  The survival strategies that you talk about with the seeds and the water.
[01:41:17.253 --> 01:41:19.434]  Number three.
[01:41:19.434 --> 01:41:20.975]  Any money that you do have,
[01:41:22.043 --> 01:41:23.744]  I keep it in my own hands.
[01:41:23.744 --> 01:41:25.145]  Why keep it in the bank?
[01:41:25.145 --> 01:41:27.166]  What are you getting from putting it there?
[01:41:27.166 --> 01:41:29.167]  You're only taking a risk.
[01:41:29.167 --> 01:41:34.009]  Speaking only for myself, I'm a firm believer in gold.
[01:41:35.314 --> 01:41:37.836]  80% of my gold, my assets are in gold.
[01:41:37.836 --> 01:41:43.859]  And then people, you know, I see these comments, they say, oh, Salenti's involved with, you know, gold companies.
[01:41:43.859 --> 01:41:45.179]  No, I'm not.
[01:41:45.179 --> 01:41:47.681]  I don't take a penny from anybody.
[01:41:47.681 --> 01:41:50.562]  So it's only what I do and what I believe.
[01:41:50.562 --> 01:41:52.283]  And I've been writing about it for years.
[01:41:52.927 --> 01:41:58.874]  And number three, or number four, I'm a believer in Second Amendment rights.
[01:41:58.874 --> 01:42:05.482]  Make sure you're armed for the worst to happen, because you're going to see violence increase at a very rapid rate.
[01:42:05.482 --> 01:42:08.606]  So those are the kind of initial things to consider.
[01:42:08.606 --> 01:42:11.930]  Grow your own, those crisis gardens that you talk about.
[01:42:12.423 --> 01:42:14.584]  The summer is coming upon us.
[01:42:14.584 --> 01:42:22.126]  You can grow all the food you need to feed your family and have a lot left over and put it up for the winter.
[01:42:22.126 --> 01:42:30.349]  So anything you can do, that Yankee frugality, let's go back to the things that made this country what it was.
[01:42:30.349 --> 01:42:35.550]  Use it up, wear it out, make it do, do without.
[01:42:35.550 --> 01:42:39.832]  Well, expanding on that, I think about my grandfather on my dad's side.
[01:42:39.832 --> 01:42:40.392]  He would
[01:42:41.132 --> 01:42:43.913]  Repair his own equipment.
[01:42:43.913 --> 01:42:45.253]  I mean, you talk about MacGyver.
[01:42:45.253 --> 01:42:48.594]  And all those old farmers and ranchers were like that.
[01:42:48.594 --> 01:42:50.715]  My dad has a lot of those skills.
[01:42:50.715 --> 01:42:53.116]  I don't have one-tenth of the skills my dad has.
[01:42:53.116 --> 01:42:56.157]  He has probably half the skills his father had.
[01:42:56.157 --> 01:43:03.559]  And everybody knew, even in good times, to have storable food, to be prepared, to save money, because they'd gone through the Great Depression.
[01:43:03.559 --> 01:43:05.320]  And if we had, right at 90% of the public,
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:07.961]  We're good to go.
[01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:37.525]  Nobody's going to be able to take care of you, the government, the banks, they couldn't even help with Katrina, they can't even stop an oil leak.
[01:43:37.525 --> 01:43:54.177]  I mean, my God, we're talking about a road warrior situation, and I see the reports where they're laying off half the teachers in some cities, more than half the cops, half the sheriff's deputies, and the half they keep are there in the news being told they're just there to raise revenue and write tickets for the government.
[01:43:54.537 --> 01:44:02.446]  So, and I'm starting to see a lot of sheriffs in Texas and Pennsylvania and Ohio say, buy guns, you've got to protect yourself.
[01:44:02.446 --> 01:44:07.772]  So we're seeing the veneer of the civilization, the rotten paint starting to peel off.
[01:44:09.232 --> 01:44:14.493]  Yeah, and you said it about in the old days people knew how to do it themselves.
[01:44:14.493 --> 01:44:15.994]  I own a 1994 Audi.
[01:44:15.994 --> 01:44:19.855]  I could buy anything that I want to buy.
[01:44:19.855 --> 01:44:22.656]  I don't want one of those cars.
[01:44:22.656 --> 01:44:25.056]  I don't need all those gadgets.
[01:44:25.056 --> 01:44:26.317]  You know, kick the addiction.
[01:44:26.317 --> 01:44:34.859]  And by the way, stop wasting your money and going to college and getting a degree in business administration.
[01:44:34.859 --> 01:44:36.840]  This is a lot of baloney.
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:38.520]  If you're going to go to college,
[01:44:39.233 --> 01:44:44.936]  Only do it for a skill that you can get a return on investment.
[01:44:44.936 --> 01:44:47.837]  That's one of the biggest rackets in this country.
[01:44:47.837 --> 01:44:50.858]  We talk about the military-industrial complex.
[01:44:50.858 --> 01:44:54.740]  We talk about big pharma, big food.
[01:44:54.740 --> 01:44:58.342]  It's also the college-industrial complex.
[01:44:58.342 --> 01:45:01.923]  This is one of the greatest scams going on in the world.
[01:45:01.923 --> 01:45:02.784]  I love it!
[01:45:02.784 --> 01:45:06.425]  Oh, my son got a scholarship.
[01:45:06.425 --> 01:45:08.006]  Oh, not a full scholarship.
[01:45:08.365 --> 01:45:10.406]  A partial scholarship.
[01:45:10.406 --> 01:45:12.066]  How much is it going to cost?
[01:45:12.066 --> 01:45:15.067]  Oh, only about $20,000 a year.
[01:45:15.067 --> 01:45:17.507]  Oh, it would have cost $40,000 a year.
[01:45:17.507 --> 01:45:19.368]  Yeah, you know what it's like?
[01:45:19.368 --> 01:45:25.949]  It's like going to one of these bazaars in Turkey where they give you, oh, you could buy it for this price.
[01:45:25.949 --> 01:45:28.550]  They'll get any dollar that they can get.
[01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:37.152]  You're wasting your money sending your kid to school if they're not going to get a diploma that's going to buy them a job.
[01:45:37.759 --> 01:45:42.308]  Stop this nonsense and put the money to good use.
[01:45:42.308 --> 01:45:45.875]  And if you want to get a skill in business administration,
[01:45:46.730 --> 01:45:49.891]  Start as an apprentice, working for somebody.
[01:45:49.891 --> 01:45:51.191]  But that's the way it was done.
[01:45:51.191 --> 01:45:52.312]  That's the way it was done.
[01:45:52.312 --> 01:45:55.353]  I mean, I read about the founding fathers and then Andrew Jackson.
[01:45:55.353 --> 01:45:56.633]  They were all apprentices.
[01:45:56.633 --> 01:45:58.394]  That's how they got their law degree.
[01:45:58.394 --> 01:46:04.255]  That's how they got their professorship, is that there were a lot of people that wanted to be apprentices.
[01:46:04.255 --> 01:46:09.337]  They only took the people that were smart and willing to work, and that's what built this country, was the apprenticeship system.
[01:46:10.541 --> 01:46:11.282]  Exactly!
[01:46:11.282 --> 01:46:23.915]  People are wasting... These kids are getting out of college with $50,000 in debt, and they can't get a job stocking shelves at Walmart at 1 in the morning.
[01:46:23.915 --> 01:46:24.936]  I want to go to calls.
[01:46:24.936 --> 01:46:28.799]  Time goes so fast with Gerald Cilente.
[01:46:28.799 --> 01:46:31.142]  Man, we could spend 10 hours with him here.
[01:46:31.142 --> 01:46:33.184]  I want to go to calls and ask you some other questions, but quickly,
[01:46:34.268 --> 01:46:39.690]  You've said some terrorist aid, some of it's provocateur, we know that's true, but you said no.
[01:46:39.690 --> 01:46:42.431]  2010, Pakistan is going to start attacking.
[01:46:42.431 --> 01:46:48.252]  You said small attacks, but also leading to huge attacks as big as 9-11.
[01:46:48.252 --> 01:46:51.353]  And now we see the situation with Pakistan.
[01:46:51.353 --> 01:46:51.994]  Go ahead.
[01:46:51.994 --> 01:46:53.074]  I mean, how did you predict that?
[01:46:54.254 --> 01:46:56.556]  It's so easy to see.
[01:46:56.556 --> 01:47:00.418]  President Obama, the Nobel Peace Prize winner.
[01:47:00.418 --> 01:47:04.681]  You know, I wonder if Norway is Orwell spelled backwards.
[01:47:04.681 --> 01:47:10.024]  They've expanded that war in Pakistan, this brilliant AfPak strategy.
[01:47:10.024 --> 01:47:17.488]  You know, these swivel chair generals and secretaries of this and that coming up with these wonderful strategies.
[01:47:17.488 --> 01:47:23.392]  They're going to weed out the Taliban and al-Qaeda on the Afghan-Pakistan borders.
[01:47:23.911 --> 01:47:27.532]  So Pakistan is fighting this huge war.
[01:47:27.532 --> 01:47:31.613]  There's the greatest refugee crisis since Rwanda.
[01:47:31.613 --> 01:47:43.716]  They've now announced yesterday, CNN, 1,000 drones and it says the kids piloting these by remote are allowed, in fact print that again for me, to kill anybody they want with no evidence.
[01:47:43.716 --> 01:47:48.057]  They just said that they can just kill anybody who quote acts like a gorilla.
[01:47:49.415 --> 01:47:53.057]  I know, these are called extrajudicial killings.
[01:47:53.057 --> 01:47:55.238]  White shoe boy languages.
[01:47:55.238 --> 01:47:59.661]  And it's also what it is, it's against international law.
[01:47:59.661 --> 01:48:08.886]  So what's happening is, President Obama has already, I think it's 34 major drone strikes this year, and bi-weekly.
[01:48:08.886 --> 01:48:15.629]  And by the way, the CIA is behind it, and they're not supposed to be involved in these kind of things.
[01:48:15.629 --> 01:48:17.110]  So now here's the scenario.
[01:48:18.410 --> 01:48:20.951]  Your family gets killed.
[01:48:20.951 --> 01:48:23.573]  Your relatives are slaughtered, maimed.
[01:48:23.573 --> 01:48:31.557]  They've lost everything because of a huge proxy war that Washington is fighting in Pakistan.
[01:48:31.557 --> 01:48:33.839]  You think you want to get even?
[01:48:33.839 --> 01:48:39.082]  Has nothing to do with Al-Qaeda or the Taliban.
[01:48:39.082 --> 01:48:41.323]  Oh, it may, but there's other things.
[01:48:41.323 --> 01:48:43.324]  It's as old as the Old Testament.
[01:48:44.096 --> 01:48:46.418]  It's called revenge.
[01:48:46.418 --> 01:48:49.080]  And we're going to see revenge attacks.
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:49:01.912]  And then, Alex, they come up with this fairy tale that by waging this war, we're going to weed out the Taliban and the al-Qaeda on these borders of Pakistan and Afghanistan.
[01:49:01.912 --> 01:49:03.453]  Oh, y'all are you.
[01:49:03.453 --> 01:49:07.336]  How about getting rid of the bloods in the crypts in Los Angeles?
[01:49:07.336 --> 01:49:10.139]  Just start there before you move around the country.
[01:49:10.666 --> 01:49:12.107]  They can't do that!
[01:49:12.107 --> 01:49:14.968]  Who in their right mind believes these fairy tales?
[01:49:14.968 --> 01:49:23.092]  It's the military-industrial complex that Eisenhower, that Smedley Butler, and other great Americans warned us about.
[01:49:23.092 --> 01:49:24.853]  And they know!
[01:49:24.853 --> 01:49:28.315]  And they know that it's going to cause people to attack.
[01:49:28.315 --> 01:49:31.477]  And they want the attacks as a pretext to take our freedoms.
[01:49:32.808 --> 01:49:33.729]  Exactly.
[01:49:33.729 --> 01:49:42.333]  So this is why we're talking about the economics collapse, the economic collapse coming from many different directions.
[01:49:42.333 --> 01:49:45.154]  Because just like now, what happened?
[01:49:45.154 --> 01:49:48.436]  The oil spill was all over the news.
[01:49:48.436 --> 01:49:56.340]  It drained from the news when the Times Square bomber surfaced.
[01:49:56.340 --> 01:49:58.521]  Well, you know, we've confirmed they were running a drill.
[01:49:58.521 --> 01:50:00.062]  That whole thing looks suspicious to me.
[01:50:02.108 --> 01:50:08.553]  But again, what they'll do when there's a terrorist strike, the people will rally behind the president.
[01:50:08.553 --> 01:50:11.295]  Look, they did it with Bush.
[01:50:11.295 --> 01:50:19.301]  92% of the people wanted to go attack Afghanistan to bring back Osama bin Laden dead or alive.
[01:50:19.301 --> 01:50:21.142]  It's nine years later.
[01:50:21.142 --> 01:50:23.344]  Yeah, one of the Iranians quoted that.
[01:50:23.344 --> 01:50:25.045]  He said he's in Washington.
[01:50:25.638 --> 01:50:31.040]  Gerald, we're going to come back and take some calls and ask some quick questions and cover any other trends that you want to discuss here with us.
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:33.141]  Gerald Salente is our guest.
[01:50:33.141 --> 01:50:36.902]  But going on a break, I want to come back and have you answer this question briefly.
[01:50:36.902 --> 01:50:44.965]  When you talk about a great war, that's what governments always do when they're imploding, is they launch a big war, World War III style, as a political distraction.
[01:50:44.965 --> 01:50:46.546]  I mean, is that what you're basically saying is coming?
[01:50:47.509 --> 01:50:49.852]  We're saying World War III is on the way.
[01:50:49.852 --> 01:50:57.461]  The riots in Greece will spread across Europe, will spread east into Ukraine, into Latvia, Estonia.
[01:50:57.461 --> 01:51:00.164]  The world is going to be on fire!
[01:51:01.075 --> 01:51:02.376]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.376 --> 01:51:07.961]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.961 --> 01:51:12.985]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.985 --> 01:51:18.570]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.570 --> 01:51:23.794]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.794 --> 01:51:25.676]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:51:26.095 --> 01:51:30.898]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.898 --> 01:51:31.999]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.999 --> 01:51:35.061]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:35.061 --> 01:51:38.704]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.704 --> 01:51:41.886]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:41.886 --> 01:51:44.108]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:44.108 --> 01:51:45.048]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.048 --> 01:51:45.248]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:45.248 --> 01:51:46.369]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:51:55.185 --> 01:51:57.755]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:57.755 --> 01:52:00.124]  This is Alex Jones for Survival Seed Bank dot com.

[01:53:00.973 --> 01:53:06.799]  Did you know there is a growing number of researchers who agree that 90% of all disease begins in the colon?
[01:53:06.799 --> 01:53:12.025]  Did you know that 80% of all Americans suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[01:53:12.025 --> 01:53:14.868]  If allowed, our bodies are capable of healing themselves.
[01:53:14.868 --> 01:53:20.654]  The key to optimal health is not only what we eat, but also a healthy digestive system and a strong immune system.
[01:53:20.854 --> 01:53:29.996]  At Freshwater Organics, we offer FPP, a daily organic supplement that helps eliminate parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol naturally and safely.
[01:53:29.996 --> 01:53:37.718]  FPP, or fossilized phytoplankton powder, has been used worldwide for thousands of uses and is now available from Freshwater Organics.
[01:53:37.718 --> 01:53:44.920]  In addition, we offer an entire line of products to help cleanse waste and toxins, strengthen your immune system, and improve your overall well-being.
[01:53:45.060 --> 01:53:45.340]  I think so.
[01:54:12.348 --> 01:54:16.410]  Alright, we got Gerald this segment, the next, and Bob Chapman, the whodunit.
[01:54:16.410 --> 01:54:20.332]  What really happened yesterday with the thousand point plunge?
[01:54:20.332 --> 01:54:22.993]  What's happening in the markets and more of your calls?
[01:54:22.993 --> 01:54:29.616]  I've got some Twitter questions and Randy, Shanky, Joe, Jeff, and Fred and others, but a quick question Gerald Cilente.
[01:54:29.616 --> 01:54:36.039]  There's a lot of drum beating by the FCC, by the media, by the governments of the world to censor the internet.
[01:54:39.162 --> 01:54:41.862]  A. When do you see this World War III thing being launched?
[01:54:41.862 --> 01:54:45.343]  B. Do you see them trying to clamp down on the web?
[01:54:45.343 --> 01:54:48.704]  Well, when it happens, they will clamp down on the web.
[01:54:48.704 --> 01:54:57.165]  When they lose control, every aspect where they lose control, they will try to double up and gain more control.
[01:54:57.165 --> 01:54:59.906]  The war is happening now.
[01:54:59.906 --> 01:55:07.667]  It was announced just two days ago that President Obama is going to step up the attacks in Pakistan.
[01:55:08.793 --> 01:55:12.876]  From Pakistan, it could explode into India.
[01:55:12.876 --> 01:55:15.998]  We don't know what Israel is going to do with Iran.
[01:55:15.998 --> 01:55:18.219]  The whole Middle East is up for grabs.
[01:55:18.219 --> 01:55:20.320]  There is no peace process.
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:22.401]  It's only getting worse over there.
[01:55:22.401 --> 01:55:26.044]  We can't put a specific date on it, but it's in the making.
[01:55:26.044 --> 01:55:28.085]  And unless the people really become aware of it,
[01:55:28.820 --> 01:55:34.404]  What do you recommend ordinary citizens do with their assets, hard assets?
[01:55:34.404 --> 01:55:35.925]  More precisely, what type should we get into?
[01:55:35.925 --> 01:55:37.567]  I'm not allowed by law to provide financial advice.
[01:55:57.591 --> 01:56:01.733]  That's why I always make it clear, this is what I would do.
[01:56:01.733 --> 01:56:05.895]  And what I've done, and I've said it over and over again, it's very simple for me.
[01:56:05.895 --> 01:56:06.655]  I buy gold.
[01:56:06.655 --> 01:56:08.276]  80%.
[01:56:08.276 --> 01:56:10.917]  The rest of my money, I have hedged.
[01:56:10.917 --> 01:56:14.299]  I'm in dollars, and I'm in Canadian dollars.
[01:56:14.299 --> 01:56:16.900]  One goes up, the other goes down.
[01:56:16.900 --> 01:56:19.141]  All I want is wealth preservation.
[01:56:19.710 --> 01:56:21.812]  Gold is my wild card.
[01:56:21.812 --> 01:56:23.833]  The other ones, all I want to do is stay here.
[01:56:23.833 --> 01:56:24.274]  That's right.
[01:56:24.274 --> 01:56:29.238]  In this game, gold could be, and this is for me personally, speculatively it could go way up.
[01:56:29.238 --> 01:56:34.743]  But bottom line, it has real intrinsic value, and so it is an emergency backup.
[01:56:34.743 --> 01:56:35.603]  It's insurance.
[01:56:35.603 --> 01:56:40.908]  I'm not looking in this danger zone to have big increases, though gold is doing that.
[01:56:40.908 --> 01:56:42.389]  I'm looking at wealth preservation.
[01:56:42.389 --> 01:56:43.310]  Thank you, Randy.
[01:56:43.310 --> 01:56:44.231]  Schenke in Georgia.
[01:56:44.231 --> 01:56:46.713]  You're on the air with Gerald Cilente.
[01:56:46.713 --> 01:56:46.993]  Go ahead.
[01:56:47.333 --> 01:56:48.654]  Hey, Alex.
[01:56:48.654 --> 01:56:49.354]  Thanks.
[01:56:49.354 --> 01:56:54.356]  Congratulations, both you and Gerald, for the great success y'all are having and getting the word out.
[01:56:54.356 --> 01:56:56.617]  I really appreciate what y'all are doing.
[01:56:56.617 --> 01:56:57.597]  My question resolves.
[01:56:57.597 --> 01:57:02.519]  Y'all were talking about money, holding cash, taking money out of the bank.
[01:57:02.519 --> 01:57:12.723]  A lot of the questions I get revolve around 401ks and IRAs and, you know, with the reflation trade and the potential of a failed Treasury auction and
[01:57:13.858 --> 01:57:21.939]  All the monetization, they have discussed basically what they're discussing in Greece, taking over the pension plan.
[01:57:21.939 --> 01:57:30.441]  Gerald, do you think they'll take the 401k, the IRA monies, and force them to Treasuries to keep this country alive as long as possible?
[01:57:30.441 --> 01:57:34.862]  If a war breaks out, that could be one of the things that they do.
[01:57:34.862 --> 01:57:42.403]  Again, what they'll use is they'll use a war or a terror attack to take any draconian measures that they can and hide behind them.
[01:57:42.878 --> 01:57:51.060]  We saw it with Bush, with the abrogation of so many of our rights under the Patriot Act, with the wiretapping, on and on and on.
[01:57:51.060 --> 01:57:53.200]  Yes, it becomes a probability.
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:55.701]  And unfortunately, I'm stuck in situations too.
[01:57:55.701 --> 01:57:57.782]  You know, I have to put money in IRAs.
[01:57:57.782 --> 01:57:59.562]  I mean, I get taxed very heavily.
[01:57:59.562 --> 01:58:02.363]  Yes, I have my money floating out in that as well.
[01:58:02.363 --> 01:58:09.424]  But again, my strategy is, and I know the downsides, believe me, but I have to do something.
[01:58:09.424 --> 01:58:10.865]  I have my money in ETFs.
[01:58:13.318 --> 01:58:17.661]  As I mentioned, both dollars and Canadian and gold.
[01:58:17.661 --> 01:58:19.542]  Alright, we're going to break here.
[01:58:19.542 --> 01:58:23.984]  I would just add that Treasury auctions are already failing.
[01:58:23.984 --> 01:58:29.088]  Most of the new Treasury auctions they have are not being 100% bought by other institutions or governments.
[01:58:29.088 --> 01:58:32.109]  The Federal Reserve is coming in and monetizing part of that debt.
[01:58:32.109 --> 01:58:33.250]  Correct, Gerald Cilente?
[01:58:33.250 --> 01:58:34.391]  That's correct!
[01:58:34.391 --> 01:58:37.152]  Alright, so the Treasury auctions are already failing.
[01:58:37.152 --> 01:58:38.553]  That's been going on for, what, a year and a half.
[01:58:38.553 --> 01:58:39.173]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:39.173 --> 01:58:39.534]  Stay with us.
[01:58:40.514 --> 01:58:46.217]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[01:58:46.217 --> 01:58:49.959]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:49.959 --> 01:58:52.281]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:58:52.281 --> 01:58:54.662]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:58:54.662 --> 01:58:57.884]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:58:57.884 --> 01:59:02.987]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:59:02.987 --> 01:59:07.169]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:59:07.489 --> 01:59:09.832]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:59:09.832 --> 01:59:12.376]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:59:12.376 --> 01:59:15.640]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:23.250]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:59:23.570 --> 01:59:28.832]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:59:28.832 --> 01:59:31.812]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:59:31.812 --> 01:59:35.493]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:59:35.493 --> 01:59:36.554]  And I got news for you.
[01:59:36.554 --> 01:59:37.914]  You're everyone else.
[01:59:37.914 --> 01:59:39.395]  Invisible Empire.

[01:59:55.566 --> 02:00:00.172]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:00.172 --> 02:00:01.333]  Big Brother.
[02:00:01.333 --> 02:00:02.194]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:07.845 --> 02:00:11.348]  Alright, we have Alex Jones on a well-deserved day off.
[02:00:11.348 --> 02:00:13.310]  He's put together a fabulous mix of
[02:00:32.273 --> 02:00:37.096]  Interviews with some of the best guest hosts that he's ever had on air today.
[02:00:37.096 --> 02:00:41.779]  And I just want to say it's great to have Alex to give him a day off.
[02:00:41.779 --> 02:00:48.563]  He's just always burns the candle at both ends and we don't want to see anything happen to him because of that.
[02:00:48.563 --> 02:00:50.985]  He asked me to come in today because gold is shooting up.
[02:00:50.985 --> 02:00:53.186]  I mean, I can't believe what I'm seeing.
[02:00:53.186 --> 02:00:57.889]  Actually, I shouldn't say that because I predicted that gold will go over its market high on Monday.
[02:00:58.462 --> 02:01:01.766]  When I was doing an interview with Alex here just back then, and it did.
[02:01:01.766 --> 02:01:06.051]  I mean, right now, spot gold has gone up over 400, or I'm sorry, $1,245 an ounce.
[02:01:06.051 --> 02:01:06.952]  Today's peak so far is $1,248.20.
[02:01:14.966 --> 02:01:19.407]  Presently right now, Gold Spot is trading at $1,245.80.
[02:01:19.407 --> 02:01:26.050]  So all these things that Gerald Salente has been talking about, Bob Chapman, I mean, you name it.
[02:01:26.050 --> 02:01:34.012]  Just the whole long list of economists that Alex has had on the air have predicted that this would happen, and now it is.
[02:01:34.012 --> 02:01:36.833]  It's happening right now as we speak.
[02:01:36.833 --> 02:01:39.774]  Now, last time I was on the air here, just a short time ago,
[02:01:40.342 --> 02:01:44.624]  I was telling you that there's going to be a shortage in gold coins and silver.
[02:01:44.624 --> 02:01:48.366]  And that's happening now, just like we had a couple summers ago.
[02:01:48.366 --> 02:01:50.387]  The prices on U.S.
[02:01:50.387 --> 02:02:00.593]  eagles in the wholesale market, the prices on double eagles, the coins that are pre-1933, all of that stuff, the premiums are starting to gain against the spot price.
[02:02:00.593 --> 02:02:06.376]  That spread is widening and it's showing up in the retail market.
[02:02:06.376 --> 02:02:08.477]  I'm having a more difficult time importing
[02:02:09.037 --> 02:02:09.438]  I'm sorry.
[02:02:33.261 --> 02:02:37.106]  30 to 60 days to take delivery of the items that you had purchased.
[02:02:37.106 --> 02:02:40.191]  And that's just the function of the marketplace.
[02:02:40.191 --> 02:02:41.673]  There is not.
[02:02:41.673 --> 02:02:44.096]  And don't even think there's even a slight amount.
[02:02:44.096 --> 02:02:45.318]  There's just not enough.
[02:02:46.408 --> 02:02:46.708]  I think?
[02:03:05.303 --> 02:03:18.955]  Special from yesterday even though gold again has gone up another $15 and right now if I price this thing for what's going on in the marketplace I'll be $15 higher a coin and that's the Frank coin at $256.68
[02:03:21.116 --> 02:03:22.737]  That's a fifth of an ounce of gold.
[02:03:22.737 --> 02:03:29.481]  That Frank coin at $256.68 is trading at a great discount to its normal price.
[02:03:29.481 --> 02:03:36.144]  And if you buy that coin, just one, you're going to get a full year subscription to Bob Chapman's International Forecaster.
[02:03:36.144 --> 02:03:38.406]  And so that's a $159 value.
[02:03:38.406 --> 02:03:42.428]  It still puts you back in the $500 an ounce range for gold.
[02:03:43.015 --> 02:03:52.122]  And with now gold at $1,245, seeing now a resistance level that's closer to $1,300 an ounce, we're going to see that.
[02:03:52.122 --> 02:03:59.368]  I was thinking that might happen this fall, but now with blowing through this $1,245, we could see $1,500 an ounce or even close to even $2,000 before we end this year.
[02:03:59.368 --> 02:04:01.069]  So if you're serious about what you have in the bank,
[02:04:08.214 --> 02:04:12.236]  Where your money is invested, take a look at gold at this particular time.
[02:04:12.236 --> 02:04:17.058]  Whether if it's in an IRA or whether if you want to take physical delivery, it doesn't matter.
[02:04:17.058 --> 02:04:24.900]  You really should be calling Midas Resources now at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:04:24.900 --> 02:04:27.561]  Now Alex has a great show lined up for you.
[02:04:27.561 --> 02:04:29.962]  I would not lose a minute of it here.
[02:04:29.962 --> 02:04:32.503]  It's coming right back on after this break.
[02:04:32.503 --> 02:04:36.985]  And I just want to tell you, if you call us right now and mention that you heard the Alex Jones special,

[02:04:40.484 --> 02:04:43.485]  Again, that's 1-800-686-2237 for the Alex Jones Special.
[02:04:59.980 --> 02:05:01.883]  Dog chewed your remote control?
[02:05:01.883 --> 02:05:02.924]  Lost your remote?
[02:05:02.924 --> 02:05:05.507]  Or is your remote control just not working?

[02:05:59.571 --> 02:06:07.577]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoods Direct was putting together a high-volume, pre-production order of the new Quick Fix Meals.
[02:06:07.577 --> 02:06:14.922]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive one free item for every three that they bought.
[02:06:14.922 --> 02:06:21.906]  Since the final shutdown of this buy three, get one free program, we've had a lot of folks calling, disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[02:06:21.906 --> 02:06:22.747]  Listen carefully.
[02:06:23.127 --> 02:06:32.834]  Starting immediately, eFoodsDirect.com will take pre-production orders for a buy three get one free program for one week ending May 14th at midnight.
[02:06:32.834 --> 02:06:37.077]  You will receive one free item for every three that you order of the selected products.
[02:06:37.077 --> 02:06:40.079]  These orders will begin shipping the first week of June.
[02:06:40.079 --> 02:06:44.282]  To order on the web, eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633.
[02:06:44.282 --> 02:06:45.203]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[02:06:52.129 --> 02:06:52.789]  800-409-5633.
[02:06:52.789 --> 02:06:55.853]  Again, that's efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.

[02:06:56.474 --> 02:07:03.502]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:07:03.502 --> 02:07:09.510]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:07:09.890 --> 02:07:17.276]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:07:17.276 --> 02:07:22.159]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[02:07:22.159 --> 02:07:30.826]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[02:07:30.826 --> 02:07:34.569]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:07:35.069 --> 02:07:41.836]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:07:41.836 --> 02:07:45.739]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:07:45.739 --> 02:07:52.106]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[02:07:52.106 --> 02:07:52.906]  Thank you.
[02:08:00.629 --> 02:08:07.874]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:07.874 --> 02:08:08.995]  Well, he testified.
[02:08:08.995 --> 02:08:13.098]  It was on C-SPAN for the CFTC.
[02:08:13.098 --> 02:08:18.902]  He had about five minutes, so he read the information very, very quickly, so we get into the record.
[02:08:18.902 --> 02:08:24.766]  And he's Bill Murphy, Chairman and Director of GATA Gold Antitrust Action Committee.
[02:08:24.766 --> 02:08:29.189]  We've had him on over the years several times, other members of GATA.
[02:08:29.189 --> 02:08:29.509]  And so,
[02:08:30.650 --> 02:08:37.432]  There have been some huge new developments that have even ended up in a few mainstream newspapers in the last two weeks.
[02:08:37.432 --> 02:08:38.772]  Whistleblowers in the U.S.
[02:08:38.772 --> 02:08:43.114]  and England and others coming out with JPMorgan Chase and others fixing gold and silver market.
[02:08:43.114 --> 02:08:47.455]  Now we've known this has gone on for a while, but now we're getting specifics.
[02:08:47.455 --> 02:08:49.115]  And they've been harassed.
[02:08:49.115 --> 02:08:51.096]  They've had a lot of problems since they've been exposing this.
[02:08:51.096 --> 02:08:52.396]  We'll talk about that.
[02:08:52.396 --> 02:08:53.617]  But this is a big deal because
[02:08:54.537 --> 02:09:05.065]  We've got the manipulation and the fact that Goldman Sachs and others were telling people to invest in derivatives while they were planning to implode them by design.
[02:09:05.065 --> 02:09:07.467]  They've now been indicted for that.
[02:09:07.467 --> 02:09:08.788]  You've got more and more coming out.
[02:09:08.788 --> 02:09:17.215]  But one of the biggest scams is the suppression of the gold and silver market in a kind of a reverse carry trade that they've been using there.
[02:09:17.215 --> 02:09:20.638]  And so even if you don't like silver and gold or aren't into real assets,
[02:09:22.205 --> 02:09:27.008]  This deals with the overall fraud and is really a central issue.
[02:09:27.008 --> 02:09:33.531]  And so he'll be with us for about the next 40 minutes or so and he won't have to hurry through his information.
[02:09:33.531 --> 02:09:36.253]  So Mr. Murphy, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:09:36.253 --> 02:09:36.893]  You've got the floor.
[02:09:37.473 --> 02:09:38.374]  Great to be here, Alex.
[02:09:38.374 --> 02:09:49.505]  One thing that I know that some of your listeners may not care about gold and silver, but they certainly care about the economy and the financial markets, and January 31st, 2008 got a place at $264,000 full-page color ad in the Wall Street Journal.
[02:09:53.989 --> 02:09:56.352]  Which was a couple of months before everything fell apart.
[02:09:56.352 --> 02:10:04.781]  In that ad, we talked about catastrophe and disaster coming directly from the suppression of the price of gold.
[02:10:04.781 --> 02:10:07.464]  And it has to do with the relationship between gold and interest rates.
[02:10:09.025 --> 02:10:10.366]  The price of gold traded freely.
[02:10:10.366 --> 02:10:11.386]  It would have been much, much higher.
[02:10:11.386 --> 02:10:14.828]  It would have been more of a warning sign.
[02:10:14.828 --> 02:10:16.228]  The thermometer would have been off.
[02:10:16.228 --> 02:10:17.809]  There wouldn't have been maybe such risk-taking.
[02:10:17.809 --> 02:10:21.891]  The interest rates wouldn't have been so low as they were for so long.
[02:10:21.891 --> 02:10:29.614]  And so it directly affected every one of your listeners, because they've artificially kept the price of gold way below where it should be.
[02:10:29.614 --> 02:10:31.895]  If gold had kept pace with inflation, it would be $2,300 an ounce.
[02:10:33.556 --> 02:10:33.936]  Absolutely.
[02:10:33.936 --> 02:10:38.900]  The suppression of gold and silver is key to their entire derivatives fraud and allowed them to do what they've done now.
[02:10:38.900 --> 02:10:40.841]  They're now calling for world government.
[02:11:00.205 --> 02:11:06.808]  Financial taxes, VAT on all banks and institutions, pay to the elite banks.
[02:11:06.808 --> 02:11:12.351]  They're involved in an all-or-nothing takeover right now, and this information could bring them down.
[02:11:12.351 --> 02:11:14.532]  You're starting to get some major traction.
[02:11:14.532 --> 02:11:17.134]  Break down how it works and the latest information.
[02:11:17.754 --> 02:11:23.439]  The Gold Antitrust Action Committee was formed in January 1999 by my colleague Chris Powell and myself.
[02:11:23.439 --> 02:11:25.802]  Chris is the editor of the Daily Newspaper.
[02:11:25.802 --> 02:11:36.191]  And to expose the manipulation of the gold price by a bunch of bullion banks like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and then we realized that the government was involved with it also, the Fed and the Treasury.
[02:11:37.052 --> 02:11:40.293]  And we've been on this 11 years, and we finally got a little daylight.
[02:11:40.293 --> 02:11:48.355]  I was on, somehow I got on CNBC 11 years ago, Ron and Donna, and that was the last time the American public heard from me in the mainstream.
[02:11:48.355 --> 02:11:50.256]  We've been banned ever since.
[02:11:50.256 --> 02:12:00.059]  And we got a break with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, where there's a great commissioner there named Bart Shelton, who's like Elliot Ness, and he's really trying to do the right thing.
[02:12:01.457 --> 02:12:08.320]  Got me on the docket to make a presentation in front of the CFTC, and that was on television.
[02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:14.162]  Of course, the only thing that the TV feed that went down was when I was speaking.
[02:12:14.162 --> 02:12:16.763]  And as soon as I was done, the feed gets back on.
[02:12:16.763 --> 02:12:23.186]  It's very interesting, because what most people don't know, Chairman Gensler, when it started, said, we're not going to get into specific allegations.
[02:12:23.186 --> 02:12:25.247]  We don't want to go there.
[02:12:25.247 --> 02:12:27.068]  And Bart Sheldon got livid.
[02:12:27.068 --> 02:12:28.068]  He went red in the face.
[02:12:28.068 --> 02:12:29.389]  He said, are we going to have censorship?
[02:12:30.319 --> 02:12:34.920]  And Chairman Gensler backed down and then the TV feed went off.
[02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:43.163]  But in that presentation I talked about how this concentration of positions by JPMorgan Chase and HSBC and other big banks are ridiculous.
[02:12:43.163 --> 02:12:49.625]  And they're way more than any other commodity market in terms of this concentration issue.
[02:12:49.625 --> 02:12:53.346]  And we then went on to explain what the manipulation was all about and so on.
[02:12:53.346 --> 02:12:57.387]  So it was quite a show because a whistleblower showed up.
[02:12:58.268 --> 02:13:17.250]  Well, let's stop right there, Mr. Murphy, because I want to go over that and take your time on this, but it seemed to backfire that they cut the TV feed when you were testifying, because it was recorded, it did end up getting out on the web, and so, I mean, that really
[02:13:18.547 --> 02:13:22.971]  Highlighted what you were saying for people and then that they wouldn't let the whistleblower speak.
[02:13:22.971 --> 02:13:24.492]  I mean, there's a serious cover up here.
[02:13:24.492 --> 02:13:25.393]  Go ahead.
[02:13:25.393 --> 02:13:25.773]  Yeah.
[02:13:25.773 --> 02:13:34.060]  Well, there is and what happened was this whistleblower Andrew McGuire got a hold of one of our directors Adrian Douglas and
[02:13:34.700 --> 02:13:45.411]  We wrote up what Andrew McGuire had to say and basically he told the CFTC by emails three, four, five months in advance what JP Morgan was going to do ahead of time.
[02:13:45.411 --> 02:13:47.794]  He says, here's what they're going to do and when.
[02:13:47.794 --> 02:13:49.015]  And it happened.
[02:13:49.015 --> 02:13:57.423]  And we had these emails and I read out with JP Morgan that their traders were laughing at the public and ripping them off and they're making all this money and the public is a bunch of dopes.
[02:13:58.184 --> 02:14:03.887]  Uh, because they get suckered all the time by these people that are acting in, uh, uh, a collusive action.
[02:14:03.887 --> 02:14:12.271]  And so, this, the email showed up, uh, you know, with the CFTC, and afterwards, I was able to present the press, uh, with these emails and so on.
[02:14:12.271 --> 02:14:16.913]  And then, uh, the next day, Andrew McGuire and his wife were, uh, hit by a car outside of London.
[02:14:16.913 --> 02:14:25.618]  It was a wild story where he was, uh, hit, and then the guy tried to get away and hit two more cars, and there was a helicopter chase, and, uh, you can't get much wilder than this.
[02:14:26.462 --> 02:14:27.542]  Did they catch the guy?
[02:14:27.542 --> 02:14:28.323]  Yeah!
[02:14:28.323 --> 02:14:30.624]  But we haven't heard anything about it since.
[02:14:30.624 --> 02:14:32.004]  Dead silence.
[02:14:32.004 --> 02:14:33.405]  But they caught him.
[02:14:33.405 --> 02:14:36.426]  Well, I don't know what's happened.
[02:14:36.426 --> 02:14:38.027]  This is amazing.
[02:14:38.027 --> 02:14:41.188]  Again, this is really at the foundation.
[02:14:41.188 --> 02:14:50.332]  It's like one of the bottom cards in a giant tower of cards that are about to topple their manipulation of precious metals.
[02:14:50.332 --> 02:14:50.972]  Please continue.
[02:14:51.516 --> 02:14:58.824]  Well, you know, one of our major issues, especially, we're concerned about, you know, what gold and silver is really where.
[02:14:58.824 --> 02:15:12.439]  One of the people who was actually a critic of ours said we were too conservative, that basically the amount of gold and silver trade in a day is 100 to 1 compared to what they actually have there in London in their vault in gold and silver.
[02:15:13.971 --> 02:15:23.398]  We believe at some point, just like what happened with Madoff and some of these other scandals, should a lot of people all want to go get their gold and silver at the same time, you could end up having a default.
[02:15:23.398 --> 02:15:27.521]  And it's going to get quite wild, I believe, in the months ahead.
[02:15:27.521 --> 02:15:37.307]  And the major thing is that we've now, because of the CFTC appearance, according to the mainstream, it seems bizarre to me, but I guess that gives us credibility.
[02:15:37.307 --> 02:15:42.311]  So now there's a great deal more interest in what we have to say, and it's spreading all over the world.
[02:15:44.352 --> 02:15:51.925]  Now, in layman's terms, explain to people why the system wants to suppress gold and silver and how they do it.
[02:15:52.654 --> 02:15:53.675]  Well, they do it two ways.
[02:15:53.675 --> 02:15:55.997]  One with physical gold, which they have to put in the marketplace.
[02:15:55.997 --> 02:15:59.721]  They take gold surreptitiously from central banks and feed it into the system.
[02:15:59.721 --> 02:16:05.146]  And then they use it with derivatives on the COMEX and other financial markets.
[02:16:05.146 --> 02:16:08.189]  And they play with the price in the paper market.
[02:16:08.189 --> 02:16:12.754]  And, one, the banks make money by flushing the specs out.
[02:16:12.754 --> 02:16:15.937]  Over the past, even though we've been in a 10-year bull market, they do it all the time.
[02:16:16.517 --> 02:16:18.859]  Pick up $30, $40, $50 at a pub.
[02:16:18.859 --> 02:16:19.540]  And for the U.S.
[02:16:19.540 --> 02:16:20.921]  government, think about it.
[02:16:20.921 --> 02:16:24.484]  What happens every time the price of gold goes nuts?
[02:16:24.484 --> 02:16:26.626]  People say, what, it's too much inflation?
[02:16:26.626 --> 02:16:27.487]  Crisis?
[02:16:27.487 --> 02:16:28.728]  Bad for the dollar?
[02:16:28.728 --> 02:16:30.249]  It's bad for Wall Street?
[02:16:30.249 --> 02:16:31.611]  It's bad for the politicians?
[02:16:31.611 --> 02:16:33.032]  It's bad for business?
[02:16:33.032 --> 02:16:37.676]  A rising gold price, whether right or wrong, suggests that something's wrong.
[02:16:37.676 --> 02:16:38.417]  At least that's what the
[02:16:39.097 --> 02:16:46.120]  Because it reveals the worthless fiat nature of the hyperinflated derivative scam.
[02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:46.840]  That's correct.
[02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:48.140]  And that's also what it does.
[02:16:48.140 --> 02:16:50.921]  In other words, we're printing all this money and so on.
[02:16:50.921 --> 02:16:56.023]  If the gold price were to rally $100 tomorrow, everyone would be jumping up and down about just what you're talking about.
[02:16:56.023 --> 02:16:59.564]  But because they keep knocking it down, there's very little conversation.
[02:16:59.564 --> 02:17:03.086]  It's kind of just subdued.
[02:17:03.086 --> 02:17:05.186]  Continue.
[02:17:05.186 --> 02:17:06.687]  I think it's going to get very exciting when
[02:17:08.414 --> 02:17:15.781]  It's ironic that God is very well known in Russia, but hardly known at all in the United States, because we have no free press here.
[02:17:15.781 --> 02:17:25.089]  And we had a conference in August of 2005, which one of President Putin's top economic advisors, Andrei Bykov, came.
[02:17:25.089 --> 02:17:28.051]  Price of Gold was $4.36, and it wasn't going anywhere.
[02:17:28.051 --> 02:17:29.673]  So it was the best conference he was ever at.
[02:17:30.473 --> 02:17:35.857]  And two days later, the gold price exploded and rallied $300 in the next nine months.
[02:17:35.857 --> 02:17:46.484]  And at that conference, I said, and was my opinion, that if it was 436, then the price of gold is going to go to $3,000 to $5,000 an ounce, and that's what will be needed to clear the market.
[02:17:46.484 --> 02:17:54.689]  So, we have a long way to go for any of you listeners that are interested in what I believe is a great investment, even though we've been up 10 years in a row now.
[02:17:56.264 --> 02:18:04.691]  And clearly, though, they're losing control because it's gone from $300 to $1,145, where we stand today.
[02:18:04.691 --> 02:18:12.196]  So, if you look at the graph, they're able to push the beach ball underwater, but then, over time, it continues to only go up.
[02:18:12.196 --> 02:18:13.457]  They can't hold it down.
[02:18:13.457 --> 02:18:14.999]  Well, that's a good point.
[02:18:14.999 --> 02:18:18.201]  And what we call it is a managed retreat.
[02:18:18.201 --> 02:18:21.884]  What they do is they never allow too much excitement to every end of the market.
[02:18:21.884 --> 02:18:25.266]  For example, seven times this year, gold has gone up exactly 2%.
[02:18:26.480 --> 02:18:28.262]  It's a book called the 2% Rule.
[02:18:28.262 --> 02:18:30.023]  They don't allow it to go up more than that.
[02:18:30.023 --> 02:18:31.524]  They work over the shares.
[02:18:31.524 --> 02:18:35.907]  For example, one of the big funds years ago, Oppenheimer lent the shares to J.P.
[02:18:35.907 --> 02:18:42.373]  Morgan, one of the kings of the gold cartel, to work over the share market.
[02:18:42.373 --> 02:18:45.775]  So they never allow too much excitement to enter the picture.
[02:18:45.775 --> 02:18:48.417]  So gradually, it's like a stealth bull market.
[02:18:48.417 --> 02:18:54.202]  There was an article the other day that said 93% of investors believe gold's going to go down from here.
[02:18:54.723 --> 02:18:56.269]  If that isn't bullish, I don't know what is.
[02:18:59.381 --> 02:19:00.022]  Absolutely.
[02:19:00.022 --> 02:19:02.844]  So 93% believe that it's going to go up?
[02:19:02.844 --> 02:19:05.025]  No, 93% think it's going to go down.
[02:19:05.025 --> 02:19:08.968]  In other words, the public is either neutral to bearish.
[02:19:08.968 --> 02:19:13.792]  And by the way, God has been right for the past 10 years about what the price of gold is going to do.
[02:19:13.792 --> 02:19:23.179]  Yet, if you go look at the records of the Wall Street firms, they've been neutral to bearish, almost every one of them, all the way up.
[02:19:23.179 --> 02:19:28.203]  I can't imagine any other sector or market where Wall Street could be so, and they're still that way today.
[02:19:29.784 --> 02:19:37.129]  Again, to put that in layman's terms, it's... In layman's terms, it means that there's nobody bullish.
[02:19:37.129 --> 02:19:42.272]  And when markets top out, it's when everyone's bullish and there's too much excitement and enthusiasm.
[02:19:42.272 --> 02:19:45.134]  There's almost no enthusiasm about gold now.
[02:19:45.134 --> 02:19:52.139]  Exactly, but the point is, they're always saying, because they're paid to and they're always wrong, that it's going to go down and it's a bad investment.
[02:19:52.139 --> 02:19:52.639]  That's right.
[02:19:52.639 --> 02:19:55.421]  But the people are ignoring them and they're losing all credibility.
[02:19:55.421 --> 02:19:55.761]  Stay there.
[02:19:55.761 --> 02:19:58.363]  Let's talk about this whistleblower story when we get back.
[02:20:00.700 --> 02:20:02.001]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:20:02.001 --> 02:20:07.583]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:20:07.583 --> 02:20:12.605]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:20:12.605 --> 02:20:18.187]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:20:18.187 --> 02:20:22.869]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:20:23.390 --> 02:20:30.513]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:20:30.513 --> 02:20:31.634]  And here's the best part.
[02:20:31.634 --> 02:20:38.317]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:20:38.317 --> 02:20:41.519]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:20:41.519 --> 02:20:44.680]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:20:44.680 --> 02:20:44.860]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:20:53.462 --> 02:20:57.365]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:20:57.365 --> 02:21:00.507]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:21:00.507 --> 02:21:07.191]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:21:07.191 --> 02:21:15.297]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:21:15.297 --> 02:21:20.881]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[02:21:21.201 --> 02:21:23.462]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[02:21:23.462 --> 02:21:28.544]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:21:28.544 --> 02:21:33.766]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:21:33.766 --> 02:21:38.128]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:21:38.128 --> 02:21:39.208]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:39.208 --> 02:21:43.230]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:21:43.710 --> 02:21:48.612]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:21:48.612 --> 02:21:51.594]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:21:51.594 --> 02:21:53.374]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:53.374 --> 02:21:53.614]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:04.241 --> 02:22:05.501]  Tyranny is here.
[02:22:05.501 --> 02:22:09.443]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:22:09.443 --> 02:22:11.665]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:22:11.665 --> 02:22:17.528]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[02:22:17.528 --> 02:22:23.771]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:22:24.191 --> 02:22:30.176]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:22:30.176 --> 02:22:34.359]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:22:34.359 --> 02:22:38.643]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:22:38.643 --> 02:22:44.587]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:22:44.587 --> 02:22:47.470]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:22:48.143 --> 02:22:50.108]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:22:50.108 --> 02:22:51.230]  It's here.

[02:22:59.592 --> 02:23:01.353]  Oh, my sinuses!
[02:23:01.353 --> 02:23:03.293]  They feel like they'll explode!
[02:23:03.293 --> 02:23:04.113]  Sinus pressure.

[02:24:04.151 --> 02:24:06.192]  This show is documented.
[02:24:06.192 --> 02:24:09.353]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:09.353 --> 02:24:12.914]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:24:12.914 --> 02:24:17.936]  I went down, down, down and the flames went higher.
[02:24:17.936 --> 02:24:20.877]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[02:24:20.877 --> 02:24:23.798]  Bill Murphy, the head of Gatom, reveals
[02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:29.863]  Whistleblower in gold price suppression is the YouTube video.
[02:24:29.863 --> 02:24:43.394]  They cut the TV feed when he testified and they wouldn't let Andrew McGuire, the independent metals trader, turn whistleblower at the center of a storm for exposing what is the largest fraud in history.
[02:24:43.394 --> 02:24:47.617]  Max Kaiser, a year before they took down Iceland, was in
[02:24:49.358 --> 02:24:55.625]  The Capitol in the fanciest hotel in the bar and there were Goldman Sachs people bragging about what they were planning to do there.
[02:24:56.397 --> 02:25:00.158]  And so he went out on TV about it, and of course, then later it happened.
[02:25:00.158 --> 02:25:02.379]  But let's talk about this whistleblower himself.
[02:25:02.379 --> 02:25:06.140]  I mean, from your own research, you can confirm, but now you've gotten the emails.
[02:25:06.140 --> 02:25:21.645]  And I remember for 10 years, different whistleblowers went to the different federal regulatory agencies with dossiers showing exactly how Madoff was stealing 50 to 100, depending on how you look at it, billion dollars.
[02:25:21.645 --> 02:25:23.805]  And they would never do anything about that.
[02:25:23.805 --> 02:25:24.706]  So please continue.
[02:25:25.486 --> 02:25:31.111]  Let's compare ourselves to Harry Markopoulos who went to the SEC for 10 years and said, look at this, it's a fraud.
[02:25:31.111 --> 02:25:34.573]  We've been going to the CFTC for 10 years saying, look at this, it's a fraud.
[02:25:34.573 --> 02:25:39.878]  I met with the Speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert, the Senate Banking Committee, the Joint Economic Committee.
[02:25:39.878 --> 02:25:44.301]  We went to President Bush's good friends here in Texas, boyhood friends.
[02:25:44.301 --> 02:25:45.923]  I got a fax back from Lawrence Lindsay.
[02:25:46.663 --> 02:25:48.205]  His economic advisory time.
[02:25:48.205 --> 02:25:56.372]  So we've really gone after this thing and we really got a break here with this Andrew McGuire because he's a, ironically, he's a former Goldman Sachs trader.
[02:25:56.372 --> 02:25:57.613]  And it's another bar story.
[02:25:57.613 --> 02:26:07.541]  What happened was he was out with these JPMorgan guys, he's known them for years, and they were laughing at him and they probably had a little too much to drink and were saying what they were doing in the gold market.
[02:26:07.541 --> 02:26:09.143]  And so he got mad.
[02:26:09.143 --> 02:26:11.805]  And he said, you know, this is just wrong.
[02:26:12.469 --> 02:26:15.711]  And so that's when we got his information.
[02:26:15.711 --> 02:26:22.136]  He's been a member of my website, LeMetropoleCafe.com, for three or four years.
[02:26:22.136 --> 02:26:24.437]  I met him in London.
[02:26:24.437 --> 02:26:25.498]  He's a stand-up guy.
[02:26:25.498 --> 02:26:26.418]  He's a smart guy.
[02:26:26.418 --> 02:26:29.701]  He deals with Asian banks and in the bullion market.
[02:26:29.701 --> 02:26:35.484]  And he just came forth and just dropped this bombshell on the CFTC.
[02:26:36.525 --> 02:26:46.675]  They're going to have a tough time letting this one go, because what do you explain to the public, especially if these gold and silver markets blow up like we think is going to occur?
[02:26:46.675 --> 02:26:56.145]  Now let's be specific, and I've talked to a lot of high power people from Wall Street that also live here in Austin part of the year, and we've discussed this case, and they say absolutely.
[02:26:56.693 --> 02:27:09.022]  When you go to these elite bars, and you're an elite trader with one of the big firms, and you're in a different division, they are so arrogant and brazen, all they talk about is how we're scum, fools, how they're going to take over everything.
[02:27:09.022 --> 02:27:09.663]  That's right.
[02:27:09.663 --> 02:27:16.347]  And they just constantly laugh and joke, because they know the government is run by their alumni.
[02:27:16.347 --> 02:27:17.568]  I mean, look at Goldman Sachs.
[02:27:17.568 --> 02:27:19.610]  They've got every major regulatory position filled.
[02:27:19.770 --> 02:27:27.194]  Well, half the Treasurers of Goldman Sachs, we'll call it Government Sachs, because half the people at the team of the Treasury come from Goldman Sachs, just like J.P.
[02:27:27.194 --> 02:27:29.155]  Morgan at the Fed's Bank.
[02:27:29.155 --> 02:27:38.141]  But that's the issue, is people ought to start going into these bars, these elite bars, which better wear a $2,000 suit, and start just recording these guys.
[02:27:38.141 --> 02:27:47.186]  But again, he sent them emails, and specifically... Andrews sent emails to the CFTC, to their legal counsel, saying, here's what's going to happen, and when.
[02:27:48.180 --> 02:27:55.672]  And he said, watch it, at certain days they seem to attack around job reports, certain government auctions, and option expirations and so on.
[02:27:55.672 --> 02:27:58.476]  He said this is exactly what they're going to do.
[02:27:58.476 --> 02:28:01.520]  And the last time, I think at one point he mentioned it, I think the price went down like $30 or $40.
[02:28:03.519 --> 02:28:04.760]  I'm proud, that's a lot.
[02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:19.751]  So, these things, this is just a bombshell that's slowly working its way around and festering and finally it's given us the attention that we've earned after working on this stuff for over a decade.
[02:28:20.578 --> 02:28:23.440]  And by the way, we're not just idle and just talk about it.
[02:28:23.440 --> 02:28:24.861]  We're suing the Fed.
[02:28:24.861 --> 02:28:35.209]  It was very difficult today for me to listen to President Obama talk about transparency, derivatives, financial market reform, when he's allowing what's occurring in the gold and silver market.
[02:28:35.669 --> 02:28:39.550]  So what we did, President Obama wants more transparency.
[02:28:39.550 --> 02:28:44.451]  We went to the Freedom of Information Act and got, asked them to tell us what the U.S.
[02:28:44.451 --> 02:28:48.252]  was doing in the gold swap area, just a gold transaction kind of thing.
[02:28:48.252 --> 02:28:54.053]  And they said, got back to us and said, no, they're exempt from telling us that they're secrets.
[02:28:54.053 --> 02:28:57.414]  And so we're suing them in federal court to try to get to the truth.
[02:28:57.414 --> 02:28:59.174]  It's the American people's gold, not theirs.
[02:29:00.945 --> 02:29:02.106]  Well, I mean, come on.
[02:29:02.106 --> 02:29:10.409]  Obama passed the stimulus package that gave banks more power, and it retroactively let all the banks keep all their bonuses and run all their scams.
[02:29:10.409 --> 02:29:11.630]  And it's not just me saying this.
[02:29:11.630 --> 02:29:28.838]  I mean, I'm reading what the Texas Banking Association is saying, and their analysis is identical to mine, that this new regulatory framework at the G20 and the national level gives the select banks, JPMorgan, Chase, Goldman Sachs, and a handful of others, the power to take over all the healthy regional banks that aren't in derivatives.
[02:29:29.678 --> 02:29:41.884]  And sets up a value-added tax on all financial transactions that's paid to the coffers of the IMF and World Bank and then fenced directly in to the private central banks.
[02:29:41.884 --> 02:29:46.487]  I mean, this is so incredible and it's being billed as getting the rich bankers.
[02:29:46.487 --> 02:29:46.907]  Stay there.
[02:29:46.907 --> 02:29:50.789]  Let's talk about how they manipulate gold on the other side and how we stop them.
[02:29:50.789 --> 02:29:52.170]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.170 --> 02:29:54.711]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.711 --> 02:29:57.392]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.530 --> 02:30:10.018]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[02:30:10.018 --> 02:30:20.908]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[02:30:20.908 --> 02:30:26.353]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[02:30:26.893 --> 02:30:31.776]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[02:30:31.776 --> 02:30:40.842]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[02:30:40.842 --> 02:30:50.969]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[02:30:50.969 --> 02:30:54.652]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:30:54.652 --> 02:30:55.672]  Silverlungs.com.
[02:31:00.335 --> 02:31:01.636]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:31:01.636 --> 02:31:07.219]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:31:07.219 --> 02:31:12.242]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:31:12.242 --> 02:31:17.265]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:31:17.805 --> 02:31:23.029]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:31:23.029 --> 02:31:25.350]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:31:25.350 --> 02:31:30.153]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:31:30.153 --> 02:31:31.274]  And here's the best part.
[02:31:31.274 --> 02:31:34.336]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:31:34.336 --> 02:31:37.959]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:31:37.959 --> 02:31:41.141]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:31:41.141 --> 02:31:43.382]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:31:43.382 --> 02:31:44.283]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:31:47.925 --> 02:31:49.366]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:31:49.366 --> 02:31:56.989]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:31:56.989 --> 02:32:00.470]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:32:00.470 --> 02:32:07.133]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:32:07.133 --> 02:32:12.255]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:32:12.255 --> 02:32:13.735]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[02:32:16.328 --> 02:32:27.379]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[02:32:29.486 --> 02:32:34.067]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:32:34.067 --> 02:32:37.908]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[02:32:37.908 --> 02:32:39.128]  Others don't.
[02:32:39.128 --> 02:32:41.289]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:32:41.289 --> 02:32:43.069]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:32:43.069 --> 02:32:45.950]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:32:45.950 --> 02:32:52.571]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:32:52.571 --> 02:32:55.292]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:32:55.292 --> 02:32:57.653]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[02:32:57.653 --> 02:32:58.513]  Others don't.
[02:33:04.088 --> 02:33:08.990]  They railed against the crown, another ragtag band.
[02:33:08.990 --> 02:33:18.374]  Bill Murphy, the chairman and director of GATA, Gold Antitrust Action Committee, is our guest.
[02:33:24.631 --> 02:33:44.134]  Let's get back into more of what the whistleblower said, how we know the big banks and governments fix the price of gold and silver, the way they make profits out of this, how this is detrimental to the public, and how we support GATTA and what you're doing, because clearly there's a fuse going to this keg
[02:33:45.034 --> 02:33:55.140]  Uh, of TNT that could blow this, this, this Ponzi scheme, this fraud sky high and really reveal all these crimes that have been committed.
[02:33:55.140 --> 02:34:06.226]  This is clearly illegal, but we want to make sure that fuse that's now burning burns faster, hotter and doesn't, uh, you know, sometimes you light a firecracker, it doesn't burn all the way.
[02:34:06.226 --> 02:34:08.547]  It, it, it stops, it sputters.
[02:34:08.547 --> 02:34:12.009]  So how do we ensure this is a touchdown for the good guys?
[02:34:12.975 --> 02:34:22.236]  Well, shows like this are a big help, Alex, and we're trying to be as visible as possible because once people look at it and really study the evidence, they go, good grief!
[02:34:22.893 --> 02:34:27.175]  And if I might say, you know, on some of the subjects you were talking about, it's not just gold.
[02:34:27.175 --> 02:34:41.123]  There's a lot of people that can talk about the Plunge Protection Team, which is the working group in financial markets, which President, I think Treasurer, head of the SEC, and head of the CFTC, work to stabilize the market.
[02:34:41.123 --> 02:34:46.706]  And there's something I've never heard one other person mention called the Counterparty Risk Management Group.
[02:34:46.706 --> 02:34:51.329]  And if any of your people are interested, they can do a Google, Counterparty Risk Management Group, and you'll see it.
[02:34:53.222 --> 02:35:04.146]  It's a group of the hedge funds and some of the big Wall Street firms, and you'll see their main mantra, it's had up by a lot of the Goldman Sachs people, is to create, quote, stability in the market.
[02:35:04.146 --> 02:35:06.807]  And they're behind the scenes working on the stock market.
[02:35:06.807 --> 02:35:09.528]  That's one reason we believe you've had this steady up go.
[02:35:10.669 --> 02:35:12.371]  Uh, you know, geez, for it seems like forever.
[02:35:12.371 --> 02:35:16.196]  It just never seems to correct and just goes up a little bit every day and so on.
[02:35:16.196 --> 02:35:23.565]  So it's pervasive in our markets in addition to gold and silver, which, by the way, they're just, they're tiny little markets for these people.
[02:35:23.565 --> 02:35:26.489]  Even if they lost money on this, it's like, would be like a lost leader.
[02:35:27.049 --> 02:35:49.085]  For the government, if you think of the trillions now, when we talk in those numbers these days, what the government's doing, the little gold market is just this little barometer that they want to have diffused, and that's why they work it over in the physical market and the derivatives, and tack at certain times and flush out the speculators, get people demoralized, and then it goes right back up again, like a beach ball, it's submerged, they can't keep it down.
[02:35:49.085 --> 02:35:53.368]  And we have a long way to go here, and we're working very hard at it.
[02:35:55.169 --> 02:36:03.393]  I talk about the gold market every day at LaMetropoleCafe.com, and people can sign up for a two-week free trial, and if they like it, it's a subscription.
[02:36:03.393 --> 02:36:07.374]  But the GATA site, they go to www.gata.org.
[02:36:07.374 --> 02:36:08.695]  It's a free site.
[02:36:08.695 --> 02:36:10.796]  Chris Powell puts out emails all the time.
[02:36:10.796 --> 02:36:15.838]  He just does a fantastic job alerting people what's going on, so they can keep abreast of the situation.
[02:36:16.818 --> 02:36:17.699]  You know, we know.
[02:36:17.699 --> 02:36:23.963]  Maybe we're going to get a break with the District Court in our lawsuit against it to try to get information from the Fed.
[02:36:23.963 --> 02:36:30.286]  I know the Fed's petrified of the gold issue, which is why they're fighting Ron Paul and his bill to audit the Fed.
[02:36:30.286 --> 02:36:32.428]  Yeah, because this isn't just a little bitty market.
[02:36:32.428 --> 02:36:39.272]  I mean, in the aggregate it is, but it could become the biggest market and it would unseat all of their fraudulent paper.
[02:36:39.272 --> 02:36:44.015]  And now we've got Bloomberg and others reporting, federal regulators are going in telling
[02:36:44.515 --> 02:36:49.964]  Public and private pension funds threatening them to invest people's savings in quote
[02:36:53.658 --> 02:37:14.312]  I didn't mean, by the way, to diminish the gold and silver issue or the size of it, just in terms of, like, if you talk about market caps or anything like this, it's a tiny market, but it's actually the most important market for just what you're talking about.
[02:37:14.312 --> 02:37:20.776]  When that goes, it will be headlines all over the world, because gold and silver are not just American markets, they're world markets.
[02:37:21.516 --> 02:37:23.757]  And it's going to be a major, major story.
[02:37:23.757 --> 02:37:33.002]  And it unseats all of the major global currencies that are being debased in a concerted effort on record by the G20 so that people don't recognize.
[02:37:33.002 --> 02:37:37.905]  It's kind of like in the U.S., you know, they've got a debased currency in Mexico because it's 3-to-1, 4-to-1.
[02:37:37.905 --> 02:37:44.408]  But instead now, with the Euro and all the other major currencies, they're devaluing them basically simultaneously.
[02:37:44.986 --> 02:37:47.288]  Yes, that's right, right to the point.
[02:37:47.288 --> 02:37:55.554]  Matter of fact, I mentioned Russia earlier, like the NBC of Russia, Studio One, came here about two weeks ago with a camera person and a reporter.
[02:37:55.554 --> 02:37:57.275]  They're doing a big story on this.
[02:37:57.275 --> 02:38:03.100]  And as I said, it's so ironic that God is very well known in Russia and not known at all in the United States.
[02:38:03.100 --> 02:38:07.883]  Well, Russia, if you actually... Anthony Sutton and others got the U.S.
[02:38:07.883 --> 02:38:10.065]  government documents on this, and of course he worked for the Senate.
[02:38:10.932 --> 02:38:17.614]  uh... that the large central banks here and in england funded the communist and uh... when
[02:38:18.647 --> 02:38:21.750]  The Russians in the late 90s kicked out the oligarchs.
[02:38:21.750 --> 02:38:25.994]  It turned out they were all fronts for Western brokerage houses and banks.
[02:38:25.994 --> 02:38:31.558]  And Russia's got its own problems, but Russia is now in many cases more free market than we are.
[02:38:31.558 --> 02:38:33.420]  They pay people to have children, though.
[02:38:33.420 --> 02:38:35.462]  Our government wants a one-child policy.
[02:38:35.462 --> 02:38:37.383]  They've arrested the oligarchs.
[02:38:37.383 --> 02:38:39.185]  They're talking about world government.
[02:38:39.185 --> 02:38:42.027]  They're talking about the New World Order.
[02:38:42.027 --> 02:38:44.950]  And they're covering all these subjects.
[02:38:45.590 --> 02:38:55.660]  Because for the first time in close to 100 years, there appears to be a real fissure between Russia and the Anglo-American banking establishment.
[02:38:55.660 --> 02:39:06.170]  Well, I know that the Bank of England has been very responsible for the gold price suppression scheme, and right now it's a big deal, the gold subject, because Gordon Brown's running for re-election.
[02:39:07.248 --> 02:39:09.649]  He sold half their gold right at the bottom of the market.
[02:39:09.649 --> 02:39:14.512]  And I've had this all laid out with his connection with Goldman Sachs.
[02:39:14.512 --> 02:39:16.173]  The brilliant banks were in trouble back then.
[02:39:16.173 --> 02:39:17.113]  They needed supply.
[02:39:17.113 --> 02:39:19.115]  So he sold England's gold at the bottom.
[02:39:19.115 --> 02:39:21.076]  It's cost him billions and billions of dollars.
[02:39:21.076 --> 02:39:25.718]  And we're trying to make some hay with this one before the election over there in England.
[02:39:25.718 --> 02:39:26.399]  Absolutely.
[02:39:26.399 --> 02:39:27.539]  That's the type of thing they do.
[02:39:27.539 --> 02:39:32.342]  And of course, you go back to 1933 when they made physical holding of gold illegal.
[02:39:33.277 --> 02:39:35.279]  And then they jacked up the price a few years ago.
[02:39:35.279 --> 02:39:39.043]  They doubled it after all our gold had basically been shipped to Europe.
[02:39:39.043 --> 02:39:42.547]  So they run these scams.
[02:39:42.547 --> 02:39:53.899]  Other points that are important for people to be made aware of, looking into your crystal ball and talking to people in the markets, I don't want you to make a prediction, but if you had to dead reckon, how do you see this unfolding?
[02:39:54.929 --> 02:40:03.332]  Probably like every other scandal, whether it's Revco or Brokerage House or Enron or Madoff, it blows up.
[02:40:03.332 --> 02:40:06.172]  And then all of a sudden, everyone's running around saying, how could this have happened?
[02:40:06.172 --> 02:40:13.915]  And everybody, you know, people delve into the facts of the story, and that's how it's exposed, unfortunately.
[02:40:13.915 --> 02:40:18.696]  And it's likely to be the way it's going to happen here, where silver and gold just absolutely explode.
[02:40:18.696 --> 02:40:20.417]  There's some defaults in the marketplace.
[02:40:20.417 --> 02:40:21.317]  People can't deliver.
[02:40:22.197 --> 02:40:29.141]  Uh, on their promises, uh, uh, to deliver, you know, uh, the physical billion to people and, uh, it'll be a huge, huge commotion.
[02:40:29.141 --> 02:40:32.503]  That's how I think it's gonna play out.
[02:40:32.503 --> 02:40:33.524]  What's the time frame?
[02:40:33.524 --> 02:40:34.564]  Next two, three years?
[02:40:34.564 --> 02:40:41.028]  Yeah, you know, I, it's, geez, it's so tough about the time frame, you know, it, I mean, it could happen in two weeks or two years.
[02:40:41.028 --> 02:40:42.549]  It's just one of these things.
[02:40:42.549 --> 02:40:46.772]  Had we not had the financial scandal, Madoff would still be trucking right along.
[02:40:46.772 --> 02:40:49.153]  And a lot of this is up to the listeners of this show.
[02:40:49.153 --> 02:40:50.294]  We have several million listeners.
[02:40:51.300 --> 02:40:58.566]  Get the censored video of you and others out to people, if they get the censored documents out, if they put pressure.
[02:40:58.566 --> 02:41:09.174]  I mean, that's why Obama politically now is going after, with the SEC, Goldman, with a $5 million fine, slap on the wrist, an investigation, maybe some underling will go on probation.
[02:41:09.714 --> 02:41:13.900]  They're having to at least do that because it's political suicide if they don't.
[02:41:13.900 --> 02:41:27.758]  We need to force this out all the way into the open because even though this is a whitewash investigation, it's now opening up more lawsuits, it's now legitimizing those of us that have exposed the corruption of the main pilots of this banking cartel, Goldman Sachs.
[02:41:28.396 --> 02:41:28.776]  That's right.
[02:41:28.776 --> 02:41:39.542]  The irony is that right now the two honchos are HSBC and JPMorgan Chase, where Goldman Sachs was the ringleader in this thing for, I don't know, six, seven, eight, nine years.
[02:41:39.542 --> 02:41:42.664]  They've disappeared of late, maybe because they're concentrating on the stock market.
[02:41:42.664 --> 02:41:43.184]  I don't know.
[02:41:43.184 --> 02:41:50.228]  But everywhere we looked for a period of eight or nine years, Goldman Sachs was everywhere on this particular issue.
[02:41:50.228 --> 02:41:52.830]  Yeah, they're now top of the heat.
[02:41:53.547 --> 02:41:57.135]  Top of the heap, their underlings are now carrying on this operation.
[02:42:03.101 --> 02:42:06.244]  I think you have the number of 93%, and I'm looking at news today.
[02:42:06.244 --> 02:42:10.807]  Gold weaker as Greece debt issue back on front burner.
[02:42:10.807 --> 02:42:12.569]  Well, that's the same reason.
[02:42:12.569 --> 02:42:15.371]  The commentary is ludicrous in this industry.
[02:42:15.371 --> 02:42:19.374]  Last week, gold went up because of the Greek problems.
[02:42:19.374 --> 02:42:20.515]  Then it's down.
[02:42:20.515 --> 02:42:25.279]  If these people hit the market, then the reporters just talk about anything.
[02:42:25.279 --> 02:42:29.683]  You can have a gold white gold to be up 50 bucks on the Greek debt problems.
[02:42:30.612 --> 02:42:35.356]  Well, that's what I was about to say, just as a layman here, but I've done a lot of research.
[02:42:35.356 --> 02:42:43.163]  Having major currency crises, that even in the words of Merkel and the words of Soros, could bring down the Euro.
[02:42:43.163 --> 02:42:49.229]  This could bring down the Euro, and by every barometer, that should shoot gold straight up.
[02:42:49.229 --> 02:42:51.991]  And there's all these headlines about gold down $5 or $4.50.
[02:42:51.991 --> 02:42:53.072]  Let me give you the exact number, folks.
[02:42:56.355 --> 02:43:04.217]  Uh, gold's down $4.70 right now, and the media's saying because currencies are in trouble, currencies are- It's ludicrous!
[02:43:04.217 --> 02:43:05.698]  This is what happens.
[02:43:05.698 --> 02:43:18.582]  Over the years, and we've seen this, any followers I know there's a bunch of people listening on your show, the worse the situation or the better it is for gold, or the more reasons for people to go to gold, that's when the gold cartel attacks the price.
[02:43:18.582 --> 02:43:22.003]  Because they want to diffuse the barometer, tone down the thermometer.
[02:43:22.563 --> 02:43:25.027]  They do it all the time.
[02:43:25.027 --> 02:43:29.273]  It's just, again, it's ridiculous for people to say gold's going down because of the crisis.
[02:43:29.273 --> 02:43:31.196]  You know, it's just, it's nuts.
[02:43:32.597 --> 02:43:33.637]  No, it is nuts.
[02:43:33.637 --> 02:43:37.298]  But again, they know people are looking at a month-to-month or week-to-week graph.
[02:43:37.298 --> 02:43:42.560]  You look at the year graph, you look at the two-year, the three-year, the four-year, the five, gold's going straight up.
[02:43:42.560 --> 02:43:47.802]  And if it continues like this, what, another ten years, we'll be looking at $2,000 announced.
[02:43:47.802 --> 02:43:52.763]  We'll be looking at $2,000 probably in another year, not ten years.
[02:43:52.763 --> 02:43:54.204]  Well, absolutely.
[02:43:54.204 --> 02:43:57.705]  But I mean, even in a suppressed market, even if they continue this scam,
[02:43:59.833 --> 02:44:01.253]  You know, in 10 years it would double again.
[02:44:01.253 --> 02:44:02.214]  That's a great investment.
[02:44:02.214 --> 02:44:03.054]  Yeah, of course.
[02:44:03.054 --> 02:44:07.255]  What's happening is they're running out of available central bank gold.
[02:44:07.255 --> 02:44:11.596]  People think that the gold industry says there's 30,000 tons of gold in central bank vaults.
[02:44:11.596 --> 02:44:17.717]  Well, according to the work of our guys, which are pretty tough-shelled guys, there's less than 15,000 tons.
[02:44:17.717 --> 02:44:20.878]  European central banks are selling 400 to 500 tons of gold a year.
[02:44:20.878 --> 02:44:24.258]  The past three or four months, they haven't sold an ounce.
[02:44:24.258 --> 02:44:25.198]  It's drying up.
[02:44:25.198 --> 02:44:27.039]  Think of an army that's running out of ammunition.
[02:44:27.739 --> 02:44:29.720]  The bad guys are running out of ammunition.
[02:44:29.720 --> 02:44:32.002]  All they can do is have a rear guard action.
[02:44:32.002 --> 02:44:33.402]  But it's painful on these dips.
[02:44:33.402 --> 02:44:37.425]  It's just, you know, we should be at 2300, not where we are here.
[02:44:37.425 --> 02:44:40.066]  Well, I just did the math and I was wrong.
[02:44:40.066 --> 02:44:43.729]  I was just throwing, you know, a basic number out there.
[02:44:43.729 --> 02:44:45.610]  If gold is up almost fourfold,
[02:44:46.454 --> 02:44:50.617]  In the last 10 years, then it's exponential.
[02:44:50.617 --> 02:44:55.501]  If it was doubling, you know, basically every three, four years, then you're right.
[02:44:55.501 --> 02:44:59.144]  In another year and a half or so, it should be well above 2,000.
[02:44:59.144 --> 02:45:03.127]  But I was saying even in their rigged market, you know, we could be looking at 2,000, 3,000, 4,000.
[02:45:03.127 --> 02:45:05.229]  The sky's the limit.
[02:45:05.229 --> 02:45:10.773]  From all of your research, and I know you guys are conservative, where should gold be for real inflation right now?
[02:45:11.433 --> 02:45:12.574]  $2,300 an ounce.
[02:45:12.574 --> 02:45:15.356]  That's what it would be, and that's according to many other people.
[02:45:15.356 --> 02:45:21.200]  Had it kept pace with inflation, and that's just the published inflation numbers, much less the real inflation numbers.
[02:45:21.200 --> 02:45:23.862]  So, we have a long way to go.
[02:45:23.862 --> 02:45:34.510]  Again, if I can stress this, the bad guys are running out of ammunition to keep the price down, and you're going to see some kind of major league firework sometime this year.
[02:45:34.510 --> 02:45:36.111]  But, they do have a lot of
[02:45:37.515 --> 02:45:38.695]  Money behind the scenes.
[02:45:55.302 --> 02:45:58.444]  By using this physical gold, but they're hitting the wall.
[02:45:58.444 --> 02:46:00.386]  One of our guys, our consultants, predicted this.
[02:46:00.386 --> 02:46:04.689]  We had a conference in Durban, South Africa, May 10th, 2001.
[02:46:04.689 --> 02:46:09.833]  He said in 7 to 10 years, they're going to run out of enough gold to keep the price from really taking off.
[02:46:09.833 --> 02:46:11.554]  Well, we're right in the middle of that zone right now.
[02:46:14.122 --> 02:46:18.864]  Wow, so we could see this in the next month or the next two years, but time is on our side.
[02:46:18.864 --> 02:46:20.725]  Yeah, it's coming, and it's inevitable.
[02:46:20.725 --> 02:46:28.549]  I mean, it's just a matter of how much, again, how much ammunition they can come up with at a given time to meet the growing physical market demand.
[02:46:28.549 --> 02:46:38.273]  So, it's very exciting, very frustrating on a day-to-day basis, but again, we've been up ten years in a row, and as you said earlier, the acceleration phase is still ahead of us.
[02:46:39.261 --> 02:46:45.688]  All right, in closing, we have the head of GATA, Bill Murphy, Chairman and Director of GATA, on with us.
[02:46:45.688 --> 02:46:48.611]  Going back to the whistleblower, you say he and his family were hit by a car.
[02:46:48.611 --> 02:46:54.617]  I remember seeing that in the news, that the person ran, and that we haven't heard what's happened since then.
[02:46:55.417 --> 02:46:56.778]  How is Andrew McGuire doing?
[02:46:56.778 --> 02:46:58.019]  Have you had a chance to talk to him?
[02:46:58.019 --> 02:46:58.699]  He's fine.
[02:46:58.699 --> 02:47:02.622]  He's talking to my colleague Adrian Douglas quite a bit.
[02:47:02.622 --> 02:47:03.883]  There's a bunch of interviews.
[02:47:03.883 --> 02:47:05.484]  People are talking to him over there.
[02:47:05.484 --> 02:47:10.267]  I think he's going further with the legal counsel, the CFTC.
[02:47:10.267 --> 02:47:13.069]  So there's stuff going on behind the scenes.
[02:47:13.069 --> 02:47:14.250]  It's a process.
[02:47:14.250 --> 02:47:16.211]  These investigations do take a long time.
[02:47:16.411 --> 02:47:17.811]  Well, let me do this with you.
[02:47:17.811 --> 02:47:21.092]  Let me put you on hold and have my producer talk to you.
[02:47:21.092 --> 02:47:27.274]  I would like to get you or your other colleague on with Mr. McGuire for a full hour sometime next week.
[02:47:27.274 --> 02:47:35.017]  I think people need to hear directly from the whistleblower who saw these JPMorgan Chase people rubbing their hands together in glee.
[02:47:35.017 --> 02:47:36.937]  Do you think that's doable, Mr. Murphy?
[02:47:36.937 --> 02:47:38.298]  I'd be fine with me.
[02:47:38.298 --> 02:47:44.199]  I have to go to Miami to meet somebody at the Financial Times next week, but I'd love to do it.
[02:47:44.199 --> 02:47:46.200]  I just have to see what Andrew's schedule is.
[02:47:47.114 --> 02:47:49.976]  Okay, and you also talked about your other colleague that's working with him.
[02:47:49.976 --> 02:47:50.556]  Yeah, Adrian Douglas.
[02:47:50.556 --> 02:47:55.099]  Well, he's an oil consultant, but if he's free, I'm sure he'd love to do it.
[02:47:55.099 --> 02:47:55.419]  Sure.
[02:47:55.419 --> 02:47:58.320]  I mean, just the more the merrier, getting your different perspectives here.
[02:47:58.320 --> 02:48:00.582]  I want to thank you for your tireless 11-year effort.
[02:48:00.582 --> 02:48:02.543]  It's certainly bearing fruit.
[02:48:02.543 --> 02:48:07.405]  I mean, there you were, 260-something bucks an ounce back when you started, and it's $1,145 today.
[02:48:10.567 --> 02:48:10.928]  Any time Alex.
[02:48:41.388 --> 02:49:03.283]  Now it's 10 years ago and got all the internal minutes of the meetings between the big 10 oil companies, how they said there's too much oil, we're going to promote peak oil, we're going to tell the school kids and everybody there's no oil, we're going to fund the environmental movement to brainwash people about this, and we're going to buy up the independent refineries and shut them down, and we're going to restrict oil that way.
[02:49:03.283 --> 02:49:11.009]  And then the Pentagon comes out last week and says there's no more oil, and within two years you're all going to be paying seven bucks a gallon.
[02:49:12.060 --> 02:49:13.101]  Uh, water.
[02:49:13.101 --> 02:49:14.382]  There's more water than ever.
[02:49:14.382 --> 02:49:20.345]  Uh, there's all these ways to get water, even in areas like Southern California.
[02:49:20.345 --> 02:49:26.909]  But they tell you, even in areas of washing water like England, oh, you're going to pay double, triple, quadruple, now there's no water.
[02:49:26.909 --> 02:49:29.010]  When England has more water than any other island nation.
[02:49:29.010 --> 02:49:36.555]  I mean, it's just the giant aquifers everywhere, incredible precipitation, huge reservoirs, and it's just scams.
[02:49:36.555 --> 02:49:38.316]  And here in Austin, they just say, hey,
[02:49:40.527 --> 02:49:47.232]  We are going to give you a 2.6 billion, this is Austin Energy, tax over the next three years on your natural gas and power.
[02:49:47.232 --> 02:49:52.396]  That's more than all the taxes every year combined, just one new tax bigger than everything combined.
[02:49:52.396 --> 02:49:55.579]  And it's for the earth and for the children, and just shut up!
[02:49:55.579 --> 02:49:57.160]  We're going to do it!
[02:49:57.160 --> 02:49:59.282]  We're lawless scum!
[02:49:59.282 --> 02:50:00.363]  And who do they pay the money to?
[02:50:00.363 --> 02:50:02.445]  The banks.
[02:50:02.445 --> 02:50:06.208]  And the city of Austin has taken almost all the pension funds and invested it in the derivatives.
[02:50:07.239 --> 02:50:11.443]  And now the bankers have come to him and said, you better raise a bunch of taxes because there's going to be no money.
[02:50:11.443 --> 02:50:12.103]  And they go and do.
[02:50:12.103 --> 02:50:16.868]  I mean, it's just we have to get out of bed with these crooks.
[02:50:16.868 --> 02:50:18.729]  You're like, well, I'm not working with the crooks.
[02:50:18.729 --> 02:50:21.031]  Well, neither am I. But we're still in bed with them.
[02:50:21.031 --> 02:50:24.735]  We still live in a country that absolute criminal scum run.
[02:50:24.735 --> 02:50:26.256]  And they've already committed millions of crimes.
[02:50:26.256 --> 02:50:28.098]  So why not commit 10 million more?
[02:50:28.098 --> 02:50:30.440]  Why not just steal everything they've already stolen?
[02:50:32.333 --> 02:50:36.414]  Everything that wasn't nailed down, now they're in there with crowbars, stealing what is nailed down.
[02:50:36.414 --> 02:50:37.714]  They've taken the kitchen sink.
[02:50:37.714 --> 02:50:38.834]  They're pulling the tile up.
[02:50:38.834 --> 02:50:40.815]  They're pulling the drapes out.
[02:50:40.815 --> 02:50:43.515]  They're now bulldozing the building for timber.
[02:50:43.515 --> 02:50:46.756]  And we're in here with it collapsing, going, hey, don't enslave us.
[02:50:46.756 --> 02:50:48.536]  And they're saying, shut up, terrorist.
[02:50:48.536 --> 02:50:50.557]  You're planning to stage terror attacks.
[02:50:50.557 --> 02:50:51.697]  We're like, excuse me?
[02:50:51.697 --> 02:50:53.517]  We're just pointing out your crime.
[02:50:53.517 --> 02:50:54.877]  Shut up, terrorist.
[02:50:54.877 --> 02:50:56.978]  The police are going to come arrest you.
[02:50:56.978 --> 02:50:57.638]  And we're, what?
[02:51:00.930 --> 02:51:01.711]  Good question.
[02:51:01.711 --> 02:51:07.917]  If you have a septic system, did you know that proper maintenance can save you thousands of dollars in costly and unnecessary repairs?

[02:52:06.175 --> 02:52:10.116]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:52:10.116 --> 02:52:12.357]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:52:12.357 --> 02:52:18.219]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:52:18.219 --> 02:52:24.422]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.

[02:54:17.458 --> 02:54:18.939]  All right, we're back.
[02:54:18.939 --> 02:54:21.200]  As you can notice, this is not Alex Jones speaking.
[02:54:21.200 --> 02:54:22.041]  I'm Ted Anderson.
[02:54:22.041 --> 02:54:24.783]  I own the Genesis Communications Network.
[02:54:24.783 --> 02:54:30.927]  Been a long, proud sponsor of Alex Jones for, gosh, it's getting up to 15 years now.
[02:54:30.927 --> 02:54:32.167]  And there goes Bill Murphy.
[02:54:32.167 --> 02:54:34.469]  What a good friend of mine he's been.
[02:54:34.469 --> 02:54:40.833]  He knows more about what's been going on with the central banks and their manipulation that they've had in the gold market
[02:54:41.311 --> 02:54:46.297]  Then short of the people that are doing it, I mean, he's the expert in the whole thing.
[02:54:46.297 --> 02:54:54.466]  He's calling for over $3,000 gold and that was, we had him up there a week ago and now gold's up over a hundred bucks since he was here.
[02:54:54.466 --> 02:54:55.988]  That's amazing.
[02:54:55.988 --> 02:55:01.274]  You know, gold now, I was up, I was up here at the end of the hour last hour and gold was sitting at $1,000.
[02:55:02.981 --> 02:55:03.722]  $1,245 today, now it's sitting at $1,249.60.
[02:55:12.549 --> 02:55:16.110]  That is almost $1,250 an ounce.
[02:55:16.110 --> 02:55:27.374]  We are very close to the end of this trading day, and when it closes, if it holds that number, we'll have closed at a number that gold has never seen before in its history against the U.S.
[02:55:27.374 --> 02:55:28.115]  dollar.
[02:55:28.115 --> 02:55:37.758]  Obviously, against the European, uh, EU, gold has been trading at a much higher rate than it's ever seen before, but now we're seeing it in the United States dollar as well.
[02:55:38.138 --> 02:55:39.839]  I mean, the news is out there right now.
[02:55:39.839 --> 02:55:42.800]  I mean, gold ends at 1243.10.
[02:55:42.800 --> 02:55:45.042]  That's a closing for yesterday.
[02:55:45.042 --> 02:55:49.384]  Or actually, it's this morning's European news when the London market had closed.
[02:55:49.384 --> 02:55:51.905]  I mean, gold is shooting up like you wouldn't believe.
[02:55:51.905 --> 02:55:54.466]  And we hit our last peak in December of 2009.
[02:55:54.466 --> 02:55:57.828]  And I got to say this, I price these francs
[02:55:58.308 --> 02:56:04.073]  About the time that Bill Murphy was on the air, which is about $1,245 gold.
[02:56:04.073 --> 02:56:05.695]  Right now I've got them at $256.68.
[02:56:05.695 --> 02:56:13.402]  If you go to the web offer, it's over $270 a coin now.
[02:56:13.402 --> 02:56:15.103]  So you just can't beat it.
[02:56:15.103 --> 02:56:18.887]  If you're looking to buy gold, now's the time to be getting in.
[02:56:18.887 --> 02:56:24.612]  We still have many other items available at very discounted rates, but I gotta tell ya,
[02:56:25.112 --> 02:56:33.216]  The premiums on the wholesale markets for the bullion and the older collector-grade gold coins are going up.
[02:56:33.216 --> 02:56:41.340]  The market is getting hot, and like Bill Murphy said, there's simply not enough physical supply on hand to meet the demand.
[02:56:41.340 --> 02:56:48.623]  And now the central banks have lost control of the marketplace, and they're not going to be able to manipulate it downward as they had in the past.
[02:56:49.023 --> 02:56:50.964]  And that's why you're seeing what you're seeing.
[02:56:50.964 --> 02:56:54.126]  Bill Murphy predicted it two weeks ago, and here it is.
[02:56:54.126 --> 02:56:56.788]  I mean, the guy's 100% accurate.
[02:56:56.788 --> 02:57:00.570]  Like he said on his website, he just simply hasn't been wrong.
[02:57:00.570 --> 02:57:02.051]  And how could he be wrong?
[02:57:02.051 --> 02:57:10.376]  I mean, you're measuring gold against a fiat currency that's being printed and shoved into the economy like nobody's business.
[02:57:10.376 --> 02:57:10.756]  Anyways,
[02:57:11.243 --> 02:57:12.845]  Frank's right now at $256.68.
[02:57:12.845 --> 02:57:18.011]  If you want to get a hold of us here at Midas, our telephone number is 1-800-686-2237.
[02:57:18.011 --> 02:57:18.291]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:57:26.636 --> 02:57:35.283]  Two, two, three, seven, and I must say that this has got to be one of the best days Alex had on air, even though he's not even on air right now.
[02:57:35.283 --> 02:57:42.348]  It's a replay, but the next part, the next segment of the show is just as good as what you've been hearing in the past few hours.
[02:57:42.348 --> 02:57:45.211]  It's a fabulous day to be listening to Alex Jones.
[02:57:45.211 --> 02:57:47.172]  I would suggest that you stay tuned.
[02:57:47.172 --> 02:57:49.374]  Again, it's that frank offer that I think is so
[02:57:49.854 --> 02:58:06.791]  Special at this point in time because there are 256 68 and if you put the fact in that I'm buying you a full year subscription to Bob Chapman's newsletter and we all know how important it is to be aware of what's going on in the marketplace today and Bob lays it out so clear and so
[02:58:07.592 --> 02:58:13.796]  You know, 45, 50 pages every two times a week.
[02:58:13.796 --> 02:58:14.717]  It's a great value.
[02:58:14.717 --> 02:58:15.577]  So call us at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:58:15.577 --> 02:58:15.777]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:58:15.777 --> 02:58:17.418]  What a wonderful day it's been.
[02:58:17.418 --> 02:58:19.640]  And I just want to wish Alex Jones a great day off.
[02:58:19.640 --> 02:58:22.081]  And he got more in store, so stay tuned.
[02:58:42.170 --> 02:58:45.434]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:59:01.852 --> 02:59:07.736]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:59:07.736 --> 02:59:13.961]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.

[02:59:38.325 --> 02:59:40.306]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:59:40.306 --> 02:59:40.746]  It's here.

[02:59:53.517 --> 02:59:55.900]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:55.900 --> 02:59:58.702]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:10.333 --> 03:00:10.613]  3F 5.83 x (-1.00)(2A 3.63 x (-1.00)]
[03:00:27.844 --> 03:00:33.729]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:00:33.729 --> 03:00:38.613]  First of all, as a Texan, I would like to point out this is a reference to the Alamo.
[03:00:38.613 --> 03:00:44.498]  Colonel William Travis recognized that the outcome was hopeless.
[03:00:45.559 --> 03:00:54.385]  And he told the men at the Alamo that he could not, in good conscience, order them to stay and fight.
[03:00:54.385 --> 03:00:58.908]  He took his saber and drew a line in the sand.
[03:00:58.908 --> 03:01:11.696]  And he indicated that, regardless of what they did, he, William Travis, was going to stay at the Alamo and, even if necessary, single-handedly defend the fort.
[03:01:11.696 --> 03:01:13.498]  The line in the sand
[03:01:14.198 --> 03:01:20.042]  has come to be your final straw, the last outcome.
[03:01:20.042 --> 03:01:26.066]  Much like survival, individual survival, that is a personal issue.
[03:01:26.066 --> 03:01:27.607]  We the people are the boss.
[03:01:27.607 --> 03:01:37.974]  And when the government becomes destructive of the Constitution, of the Bill of Rights, it is not just our job and our right, it is our duty to remove that government.
[03:01:37.974 --> 03:01:39.055]  What does the Constitution tell us?
[03:01:39.055 --> 03:01:39.815]  Security.
[03:01:39.815 --> 03:01:40.676]  Where do we find that word?
[03:01:40.676 --> 03:01:43.838]  Well, it's the only place the word security appears in the Constitution.
[03:01:45.238 --> 03:01:49.199]  A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state.
[03:01:49.199 --> 03:01:50.300]  And the security of what?
[03:01:50.300 --> 03:01:53.060]  A police state?
[03:01:53.060 --> 03:01:54.201]  A free state.
[03:01:54.201 --> 03:02:00.742]  And the only other place where the word related to security is used is the word secure in the preamble.
[03:02:00.742 --> 03:02:03.363]  To secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves enough austerity.
[03:02:04.912 --> 03:02:12.275]  You look at this and say, ah-ha, whatever kind of homeland security operation we want, its goal has got to be a free state and the blessings of liberty to our people.
[03:02:12.275 --> 03:02:13.875]  Oh, and by the way, the Constitution tells us what that is.
[03:02:13.875 --> 03:02:24.579]  It's called a well-regulated militia, and the reason we can be secure in knowing that the well-regulated militia will secure the security of a free state and the blessings of liberty is because it is composed of whom?
[03:02:25.515 --> 03:02:27.617]  The people themselves!
[03:02:27.617 --> 03:02:30.941]  They understood that was the proper way to defend a republic was through militias.
[03:02:30.941 --> 03:02:34.725]  The only thing you need a standing army for is offensive military action.
[03:02:34.725 --> 03:02:38.890]  The most powerful public servant in the county who is the sheriff.
[03:02:38.890 --> 03:02:41.513]  The sheriff can kick the feds out of their county.
[03:02:41.513 --> 03:02:42.033]  The sheriff
[03:02:42.654 --> 03:02:43.214]  You have been warned!
[03:03:12.554 --> 03:03:13.595]  We have the facts.
[03:03:13.595 --> 03:03:14.756]  We have the Constitution.
[03:03:14.756 --> 03:03:15.657]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:03:15.657 --> 03:03:17.238]  We have common law.
[03:03:17.238 --> 03:03:30.971]  It is our basic human right to not be slaves, to not be dominated by an out-of-control federal government, itself totally taken over by foreign international banks that are looting this nation of tens of trillions of dollars a year.
[03:03:30.971 --> 03:03:34.874]  Don't Tread on Me covers so many subjects, not just the line in the sand.
[03:03:34.874 --> 03:03:38.077]  The Tenth Amendment, states' rights, how to take our country back.
[03:03:38.077 --> 03:03:38.998]  It is so important.

[03:04:39.758 --> 03:04:40.639]  We're good.
[03:05:00.262 --> 03:05:08.270]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoodsDirect was putting together a high-volume, pre-production order of the new Quick Fix meals.
[03:05:08.270 --> 03:05:15.617]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive one free item for every three that they bought.
[03:05:15.617 --> 03:05:22.623]  Since the final shutdown of this buy three, get one free program, we've had a lot of folks calling, disappointed that they missed the order deadline.
[03:05:22.623 --> 03:05:23.444]  Listen carefully.

[03:06:59.625 --> 03:07:01.947]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:07:01.947 --> 03:07:04.329]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:07:04.329 --> 03:07:07.531]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:07:07.531 --> 03:07:12.655]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:07:12.655 --> 03:07:17.179]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:07:17.179 --> 03:07:19.521]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:07:19.521 --> 03:07:22.403]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:07:22.403 --> 03:07:24.925]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:07:25.305 --> 03:07:32.929]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:07:33.243 --> 03:07:38.648]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:07:38.648 --> 03:07:40.951]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:07:40.951 --> 03:07:45.175]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:07:45.175 --> 03:07:46.256]  And I've got news for you.
[03:07:46.256 --> 03:07:47.597]  You're everyone else.
[03:07:47.597 --> 03:07:49.098]  Invisible Empire.
[03:07:49.098 --> 03:07:57.106]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or watch it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:08:01.343 --> 03:08:07.548]  Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:07.548 --> 03:08:10.531]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:12.165 --> 03:08:15.087]  That's right, and it's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:15.087 --> 03:08:19.370]  And the American people and the people of the world are waking up to tearing on every front.
[03:08:19.370 --> 03:08:24.554]  Coming up in the next hour, I'm gonna get into Earth Day they had yesterday.
[03:08:24.554 --> 03:08:32.260]  Austin's announced $2.6 billion in new taxes over the next three years to be paid into the large banks just where I live.
[03:08:32.260 --> 03:08:36.063]  We're gonna get into CNN calling for one-child policy.
[03:08:36.923 --> 03:08:39.044]  It says don't be so keen on having babies.
[03:08:39.044 --> 03:08:42.205]  How about adopting a child instead or implementing a one-child policy?
[03:08:42.205 --> 03:08:55.451]  We're going to be talking about that and the financial looting legislation that supposedly is going to get the big banks, well even the Texas Banking Association saying it's a fraud takeover and another bailout to the big central banks.
[03:08:55.451 --> 03:08:56.131]  That's coming up.
[03:08:56.131 --> 03:08:59.573]  Now I spent the last hour on Fox News admitting
[03:09:00.276 --> 03:09:07.839]  That the government and Larry Silverstein were looking at the controlled demolition of Building 7, and they're now admitting that they were considering blowing it up.
[03:09:07.839 --> 03:09:09.660]  That's another big admission.
[03:09:09.660 --> 03:09:10.841]  The article's bombshell.
[03:09:10.841 --> 03:09:12.922]  Silverstein wanted to demolish Building 7 on 9-11.
[03:09:14.486 --> 03:09:19.730]  And the Fox News article is called Shame on Jesse Ventura, and that's where they admitted that their reporter was there.
[03:09:19.730 --> 03:09:22.773]  And, oh, it's no big deal that we were going to blow it up.
[03:09:22.773 --> 03:09:28.557]  So all these years later, all the video of cops saying, get back, the government's going to blow it up, they ignored all that.
[03:09:28.557 --> 03:09:30.419]  Here's another admission.
[03:09:30.419 --> 03:09:31.199]  It is a big deal.
[03:09:31.199 --> 03:09:36.223]  All right, shifting gears for the balance of the hour, we really appreciate his time.
[03:09:36.223 --> 03:09:42.188]  He's one of the most prestigious authors and lecturers and newsletter writers for Newsmax out there.
[03:09:43.038 --> 03:09:49.979]  Dr. Russell Blaylock is a prestigious brain surgeon and expert on the brain.
[03:09:49.979 --> 03:09:55.461]  RussellBlaylockMD.com is one of the websites you can visit.
[03:09:55.461 --> 03:09:58.021]  He's a board-certified neurosurgeon, author, and lecturer.
[03:09:58.021 --> 03:10:07.063]  He attended LSU School of Medicine in New Orleans and completed his general surgical internship and neurosurgical residency at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston.
[03:10:07.663 --> 03:10:13.025]  During his residency, he ran the neurology program for one year and did a fellowship in neurosurgery after his residency.
[03:10:13.025 --> 03:10:18.007]  For the past 25 plus years, he's participated in neurosurgery in addition to having a nutritional practice.
[03:10:18.007 --> 03:10:23.029]  He recently retired from both practices to devote full-time to nutritional studies and research.
[03:10:23.029 --> 03:10:30.332]  During his residency training, he worked with the eminent neurosurgeon, Dr. Ludwig Kempe, together they developed the Trans
[03:10:32.257 --> 03:10:33.497]  It's all scientific terms.
[03:10:33.497 --> 03:10:38.598]  Removal of intervascular tumors, which is one of the most widely used systems today.
[03:10:38.598 --> 03:10:43.820]  He has presented their cases, utilizing the technique to the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.
[03:10:43.820 --> 03:10:46.220]  Look, it's a long bio, multi-pages.
[03:10:46.220 --> 03:10:47.280]  I'm going to stop right there.
[03:10:47.280 --> 03:10:56.782]  And of course, we've had many other medical doctors and brain surgeons and endocrinologists and just on backing up what he's saying.
[03:10:56.782 --> 03:10:58.083]  But he has all the studies.
[03:10:58.083 --> 03:10:59.183]  This stuff is not secret.
[03:11:00.492 --> 03:11:05.415]  And we're going to be discussing it with him today, but he was very critical of the H1N1.
[03:11:05.415 --> 03:11:08.916]  He pointed out that it popped up in the wrong hemisphere, wrong time of year.
[03:11:08.916 --> 03:11:13.158]  Many other scientists, virologists said it was engineered in a lab.
[03:11:13.158 --> 03:11:18.061]  We know that other big companies with the bird flu killed a bunch of people.
[03:11:18.061 --> 03:11:19.141]  That was the London Telegraph.
[03:11:19.141 --> 03:11:22.883]  In fact, Google homeless die in bird flu vaccine trial.
[03:11:22.883 --> 03:11:24.944]  That got covered up.
[03:11:24.944 --> 03:11:25.264]  And then it
[03:11:26.078 --> 03:11:33.363]  What, three months ago we had Wolfgang Wudrig, a medical doctor from Germany, on who ran the EU 47 nation board.
[03:11:33.363 --> 03:11:37.566]  So I'm just prefacing this before we go to him.
[03:11:37.566 --> 03:11:45.912]  47 nation board that found that the UN and others were paid off by big pharma to lie and create this hoax.
[03:11:45.912 --> 03:11:47.774]  And now we have all this mainstream news.
[03:11:47.774 --> 03:11:52.937]  New Canadian study suggests seasonal flu shot increased H1N1 risk.
[03:11:52.937 --> 03:11:53.578]  Here's another one.
[03:11:56.224 --> 03:12:00.288]  Admits that they exaggerated the dangers of H1N1.
[03:12:00.288 --> 03:12:01.349]  Times of India.
[03:12:01.349 --> 03:12:01.870]  Here's another one.
[03:12:01.870 --> 03:12:04.373]  Seasonal flu shot may increase H1N1.
[03:12:04.373 --> 03:12:09.578]  Western Australian reports of adverse reactions to seasonal flu and H1N1.
[03:12:09.578 --> 03:12:12.301]  Millions of H1N1 vaccine have been recalled.
[03:12:12.301 --> 03:12:13.162]  Washington Post
[03:12:14.163 --> 03:12:18.746]  So again, Dr. Blaylock and others got attacked by the mainstream media for even questioning this.
[03:12:18.746 --> 03:12:20.887]  Well, here they are, vindicated yet again.
[03:12:20.887 --> 03:12:25.531]  So we're going to talk about the flu in hindsight and then other toxins in our food and water.
[03:12:25.531 --> 03:12:27.412]  Dr. Blaylock, thanks for joining us.
[03:12:27.412 --> 03:12:28.593]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:12:28.593 --> 03:12:29.294]  Good to have you here.
[03:12:29.294 --> 03:12:30.274]  Well, you've got the floor.
[03:12:30.274 --> 03:12:39.461]  Let's talk about vaccines, mercury, the studies that you've looked at about the increases of Alzheimer's, brain damage.
[03:12:39.461 --> 03:12:40.642]  Explain what's really going on here.
[03:12:41.877 --> 03:12:53.428]  Well, you know, I think just a brief review of this whole fiasco of H1N1 is very telling, and we need to remember this next year because this is going to be revisited.
[03:12:53.428 --> 03:12:56.110]  We're going to go through the same thing all over again.
[03:12:56.110 --> 03:13:03.717]  And remember the major government organizations, CDC, the Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,
[03:13:04.167 --> 03:13:18.995]  National Institutes of Health, all of them were just sending the same message out that this is going to be a killer virus, it's going to target pregnant women, it's going to target young people, it's going to be the most devastating thing we've ever seen.
[03:13:18.995 --> 03:13:32.502]  World Health Organization, of course, started this nonsense, yet when you actually got into the journals, the real high-tech journals that were discussing this, it didn't match what the government was saying.
[03:13:33.309 --> 03:13:41.752]  And we talked about our government as well as the international body, the UN World Health Organization.
[03:13:41.752 --> 03:13:57.977]  What the science was actually saying is that this virus is difficult to transmit, more difficult than the seasonal flu, that it is not that pathogenic, and they didn't expect it to cause that much death.
[03:13:57.977 --> 03:14:02.639]  All of this science, reported in the best of the science journals, was ignored.
[03:14:04.173 --> 03:14:12.436]  Even the CDC was secretly doing studies which found that this virus was very difficult to transmit.
[03:14:12.436 --> 03:14:18.557]  Yet, when you turned on your television, here's the news media saying, oh, this is so easy to transmit.
[03:14:18.557 --> 03:14:20.618]  It's just going to spread all over the world.
[03:14:20.618 --> 03:14:27.040]  We're expecting the ICU, the intensive care unit, to be overwhelmed.
[03:14:27.040 --> 03:14:30.541]  We're not going to have enough respirators for all the people that's going to need them.
[03:14:31.860 --> 03:14:35.663]  Young women are going to die that are pregnant in mass numbers.
[03:14:35.663 --> 03:14:42.429]  They were putting out figures of 90,000 expected to die, on and on and on.
[03:14:42.429 --> 03:14:47.333]  Yet, the science the whole time was saying, none of that's true.
[03:14:47.333 --> 03:14:58.463]  When you actually got on the CDC site, you found out, well, your whole basis for this mass vaccination and threat of forced vaccination
[03:14:59.232 --> 03:15:02.635]  That has no foundation whatsoever from your own data.
[03:15:02.635 --> 03:15:14.685]  When it soon became obvious that the number of infections by age one and one was nowhere near what the government was saying.
[03:15:14.685 --> 03:15:19.209]  And that the death rate was far less than one hundredth of one percent.
[03:15:19.209 --> 03:15:24.814]  So that meant your chances of being seriously ill or dying from the flu
[03:15:25.858 --> 03:15:28.480]  Uh, was less than 99.9%.
[03:15:28.480 --> 03:15:36.504]  Uh, so, uh, it was less dangerous than the regular seasonal flu.
[03:15:36.504 --> 03:15:42.527]  Uh, and then when the actual flu came through its first big wave, that's exactly what we saw.
[03:15:42.527 --> 03:15:47.630]  The death rate for the entire world was astronomically low.
[03:15:47.630 --> 03:15:49.731]  Incredibly low.
[03:15:49.731 --> 03:15:51.411]  Uh, well, then their next, uh, uh, uh,
[03:15:52.995 --> 03:15:56.976]  The method of scaring the public was, oh, we're watching the Southern Hemisphere.
[03:15:56.976 --> 03:15:59.437]  We're expecting millions to die.
[03:15:59.437 --> 03:16:04.938]  Well, the flu went through the Southern Hemisphere in both of its ways.
[03:16:04.938 --> 03:16:10.400]  It had one of the lowest death rates of any flu season that's ever been recorded.
[03:16:10.400 --> 03:16:12.040]  And that includes young children.
[03:16:12.040 --> 03:16:14.241]  That includes pregnant women.
[03:16:14.241 --> 03:16:19.302]  That includes the young, all of these so-called targeted age groups.
[03:16:19.302 --> 03:16:22.443]  And then I started looking at the New England Journal of Medicine.
[03:16:23.140 --> 03:16:28.246]  Which was doing the largest studies on the flu in the southern and northern hemisphere.
[03:16:28.246 --> 03:16:33.333]  And ironically, they left out one of the most important factors in the people that were dying.
[03:16:33.333 --> 03:16:37.618]  And asked that they were obese and that they were smoking.
[03:16:37.618 --> 03:16:42.084]  Well, they did mention the obese connection, but it would never enter the media.
[03:16:43.051 --> 03:16:55.945]  Well, doctor, most of the deaths we saw were people who were 75 years old, had double the amputations from diabetes, had lung problems, and then I would see a month later that, oh, this fella in Austin really didn't die.
[03:16:55.945 --> 03:16:59.009]  It was a false positive H1N1.
[03:16:59.009 --> 03:17:00.971]  They died of complications from something else.
[03:17:00.971 --> 03:17:04.595]  So there was also lots of hyping people who hadn't died from it.
[03:17:05.054 --> 03:17:08.036]  Well, everything they said about it ended up a lie.
[03:17:08.036 --> 03:17:18.665]  In other words, they were saying, well, the people were dying from bacterial pneumonia after they got the flu, and that it was pneumococcal pneumonia, therefore they need a pneumococcal vaccine as well.
[03:17:18.665 --> 03:17:27.372]  Well, when you look at the autopsy report, it said, well, most of the pneumonias were not pneumococcal, and there was no vaccine to protect anybody from it.
[03:17:27.870 --> 03:17:31.834]  And as you said, most of these people had serious illnesses.
[03:17:31.834 --> 03:17:38.501]  Diabetes, autoimmune diseases, immune deficiency diseases, cancers.
[03:17:38.501 --> 03:17:41.724]  So even in the children that were dying, they were sick children.
[03:17:41.724 --> 03:17:43.566]  They were not normal, healthy children.
[03:17:44.161 --> 03:17:53.629]  But if they could find a so-called healthy person that died from it or became seriously ill, that's the one they plastered all over the news.
[03:17:53.629 --> 03:17:59.894]  So they would tell the public, oh, you're a healthy teenager, you're at horrendous risk, look, here's a case.
[03:17:59.894 --> 03:18:03.117]  They had to search high and low to find the case.
[03:18:03.117 --> 03:18:05.759]  Most of the cases were from sick children.
[03:18:05.759 --> 03:18:07.320]  Well, it's even worse than that!
[03:18:07.320 --> 03:18:09.602]  Sick children and sick adults.
[03:18:09.602 --> 03:18:12.985]  You had very few cases of anyone else dying from this flu.
[03:18:14.191 --> 03:18:21.615]  It was all concocted from A to Z, and this is what's so upsetting about the government.
[03:18:21.615 --> 03:18:23.896]  The government knew all of this.
[03:18:23.896 --> 03:18:28.298]  They had access to the same information I did.
[03:18:28.298 --> 03:18:34.001]  So they knew from the very beginning and all throughout that this was a lie.
[03:18:34.001 --> 03:18:42.986]  This was all nothing but a concocted epidemic to sell vaccines and to do damage to large numbers of people in this country.
[03:18:43.618 --> 03:18:54.482]  Now, you remember when I first talked to you about this, when all this started, I said Illion Barre is going to be a big danger of this vaccine, particularly in the countries where they're using it.
[03:18:55.209 --> 03:18:56.570]  Uh, the MF-59, as you...
[03:19:17.389 --> 03:19:26.246]  Well, my point being is when they first started this, they said, oh, we're carefully tracking Gillian Beret because of the risk factors.
[03:19:26.246 --> 03:19:29.031]  Have you heard any major networks do a follow-up?
[03:19:29.531 --> 03:19:29.971]  No.
[03:19:29.971 --> 03:19:36.135]  Doc, stay there.
[03:19:36.135 --> 03:19:45.741]  Doc, sorry to interrupt.
[03:19:45.741 --> 03:19:46.421]  We got a break.
[03:19:46.421 --> 03:19:48.442]  Come back and tell us that story on the other side.
[03:19:48.442 --> 03:19:51.484]  I've got a list of questions for you.
[03:19:51.484 --> 03:19:52.725]  What was really in the vaccine?
[03:19:52.725 --> 03:19:56.427]  Well, we have the insert, but you can tell us what these ingredients mean.
[03:19:56.427 --> 03:19:57.067]  Stay with us.
[03:19:57.067 --> 03:19:57.808]  Dr. Russell Blaylock.

[03:21:00.954 --> 03:21:02.335]  Are you prepared?
[03:21:02.335 --> 03:21:04.638]  Well, you need to be hardcore prepared.
[03:21:04.638 --> 03:21:06.019]  There is a difference.
[03:21:06.019 --> 03:21:11.884]  To be hardcore prepared, equip yourself with the latest survival gear available at tacktowngear.com.

[03:21:16.709 --> 03:21:17.670]  What kind of gear?
[03:21:17.670 --> 03:21:20.533]  72-hour survival kits as low as $55, holsters for $21, and
[03:21:22.995 --> 03:21:23.275]  I think so.

[03:22:00.763 --> 03:22:03.144]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:22:03.144 --> 03:22:05.445]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:22:05.445 --> 03:22:08.667]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:22:08.667 --> 03:22:13.769]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:22:13.769 --> 03:22:17.971]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:22:18.291 --> 03:22:20.632]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:22:20.632 --> 03:22:23.513]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:22:23.513 --> 03:22:26.435]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:22:26.435 --> 03:22:34.018]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:22:34.358 --> 03:22:39.760]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:22:39.760 --> 03:22:42.601]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:22:42.601 --> 03:22:46.283]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:22:46.283 --> 03:22:47.363]  And I got news for you.
[03:22:47.363 --> 03:22:48.704]  You're everyone else.
[03:22:48.704 --> 03:22:50.205]  Invisible Empire.

[03:22:59.992 --> 03:23:07.999]  In March, Alex Jones announced that eFoods Direct was putting together a high-volume pre-production order of the new Quick Fix meals.
[03:23:07.999 --> 03:23:15.385]  By waiting for production and shipping of their orders, families were able to receive one free item for every three that they bought.
[03:23:15.385 --> 03:23:20.910]  Since the final shutdown of this buy three get one free program, we've had a lot of folks calling, disappointed that they
[03:23:32.970 --> 03:23:33.330]  I think so.
[03:24:05.091 --> 03:24:07.013]  Dr. Russell Blaylock is our guest.
[03:24:07.013 --> 03:24:10.035]  You can find out a lot more information at his website.
[03:24:10.035 --> 03:24:12.677]  He'll give you those several times before he leaves us.
[03:24:12.677 --> 03:24:18.241]  But while you were talking, doctor, you were trying to finish up a story about the reports you're getting.
[03:24:18.241 --> 03:24:19.022]  But I mean, I have
[03:24:19.662 --> 03:24:25.705]  Family, friends, my dad has scores of patients that he knows that have gone to the hospital.
[03:24:25.705 --> 03:24:36.311]  Many of them have recovered, thank God, and the doctors are even telling them, and I've seen this a few places in the news, but it's not a big news story like you were saying, that yes, you have Guillain-Barré, and we believe the vaccine caused it.
[03:24:36.311 --> 03:24:36.672]  In fact,
[03:24:37.944 --> 03:24:41.846]  Talking to Dale Dudley, who has the number one talk show in the morning on 93.7.
[03:24:41.846 --> 03:24:46.968]  It's the sister station to 590, our local affiliate, the AM.
[03:24:46.968 --> 03:24:54.752]  I mean, he has numb fingers and numb toes and he went to the doctor and they said, the vaccine did this to you, but that was the seasonal shot he took.
[03:24:54.752 --> 03:24:56.593]  Go ahead.
[03:24:56.593 --> 03:24:57.013]  Right.
[03:24:57.013 --> 03:25:03.176]  You know, I got an email from a man who said he felt so bad because he had
[03:25:03.980 --> 03:25:08.502]  Uh, encouraged his father to get the H1N1 vaccine.
[03:25:08.502 --> 03:25:13.163]  And he got it, and his father ended up, uh, with a severe case of Guillain-Barré.
[03:25:13.163 --> 03:25:16.464]  Ended up on a respirator for three months.
[03:25:16.464 --> 03:25:21.106]  And had just, uh, gotten out of the hospital, and he's still severely weak.
[03:25:21.106 --> 03:25:32.710]  Uh, while they were in the hospital, they, uh, saw a 10-year-old child who ended up with Guillain-Barré, ended up on a respirator for over a month, and is still on the respirator.
[03:25:34.130 --> 03:25:47.899]  I've gotten over a list of 200 women who've lost their babies because they believe the government hyped that women needed to get the H1N1 vaccine during pregnancy.
[03:25:47.899 --> 03:25:56.664]  And I warned people of that, that you would have a tremendous number of spontaneous abortions.
[03:25:56.664 --> 03:26:00.466]  And the big risk, the really big thing, is it's shown that if you
[03:26:01.110 --> 03:26:11.596]  Over-stimulate immunity during mid-pregnancy, you increase the incidence of schizophrenia and autism as much as tenfold.
[03:26:11.596 --> 03:26:22.423]  So we still have to wait and see what is going to be the full impact of this because it's going to take a good ten years before we know just how many people's babies
[03:26:25.703 --> 03:26:49.828]  This isn't like that tranquilizer in the 40s and 50s where they came out deformed and you saw it right away but again you're a medical doctor brain surgeon but let's talk about why this does that to the brain but I remember just reading in the inserts of vaccines period they had always said don't give them to pregnant women and now sickeningly they were on the news saying pregnant women particularly need this.
[03:26:49.828 --> 03:26:51.128]  I mean this is diabolical.
[03:26:51.946 --> 03:26:53.167]  Well, they were doing that.
[03:26:53.167 --> 03:27:12.480]  At the time, there was convincing evidence from our research in neuroscience that if you stimulate the immune system of a pregnant woman midterm, uh, you know, mid-pregnancy, uh, you produce this high incidence of autism and schizophrenia.
[03:27:12.480 --> 03:27:19.305]  Well, uh, I don't think I would trade having my child have autism or schizophrenia
[03:27:20.074 --> 03:27:27.976]  Well, this false idea that they were going to protect them during pregnancy, because there's no evidence the vaccine had any protection whatsoever of anybody.
[03:27:27.976 --> 03:27:29.716]  But what about the autoimmune response?
[03:27:29.716 --> 03:27:31.397]  What about the autoimmune response?
[03:27:31.397 --> 03:27:41.539]  From the medical stuff I read, correct me if I'm wrong, the miscarriages, though, throughout the pregnancy, the body gets overstimulated and then sees the fetus as an outsider.
[03:27:41.539 --> 03:27:44.040]  Yeah, you know, that's part of it.
[03:27:44.040 --> 03:27:49.121]  It interferes during the baby's development.
[03:27:50.104 --> 03:27:58.789]  With the placenta, so that the oxygen and blood supply to the baby is damaged, and you have a spontaneous abortion.
[03:27:58.789 --> 03:28:04.752]  And this was occurring in women who were almost near term.
[03:28:04.752 --> 03:28:09.174]  Here they were almost ready to have their baby, and they lost it.
[03:28:09.174 --> 03:28:13.176]  Well, if you look at the scientific literature, you're not surprised by that.
[03:28:14.185 --> 03:28:22.433]  Uh, but the media played a big role in getting these women to go take this ridiculous vaccine.
[03:28:22.433 --> 03:28:41.049]  Uh, and, uh, you know, as I say that there's just compelling research that if you vaccinate with these powerful vaccines, because they contain aluminum or mercury, uh, it produces abnormal development of the brain and produces long-term
[03:28:41.670 --> 03:28:51.378]  Changes in the brain that makes that child at high risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's for the rest of their life.
[03:28:51.378 --> 03:28:59.365]  They become hypersensitive to environmental toxins like pesticides and herbicides for the rest of their life.
[03:28:59.365 --> 03:29:02.588]  This has been shown repeatedly in the laboratory.
[03:29:02.588 --> 03:29:09.874]  Yet here we have a government policy because of payoffs from big pharma food companies.
[03:29:11.173 --> 03:29:12.134]  I don't think so.
[03:29:26.623 --> 03:29:29.084]  And these are the type of things that concern me.
[03:29:29.084 --> 03:29:31.985]  The other thing that concerns me about... Dr. Blaylock, gotta break.
[03:29:31.985 --> 03:29:32.945]  Long segment coming up.
[03:29:32.945 --> 03:29:36.086]  It won't interrupt you for 18 minutes when we return.
[03:29:36.086 --> 03:29:38.527]  Dr. Russell Blaylock is our guest.

[03:29:51.031 --> 03:29:52.451]  We're on the march.

[03:31:01.534 --> 03:31:07.121]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:31:07.121 --> 03:31:12.146]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:31:12.146 --> 03:31:17.192]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[03:31:17.712 --> 03:31:22.938]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:31:22.938 --> 03:31:30.066]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:31:30.066 --> 03:31:31.187]  And here's the best part.
[03:31:31.187 --> 03:31:37.534]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:31:37.854 --> 03:31:41.037]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:31:41.037 --> 03:31:43.258]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[03:31:43.258 --> 03:31:44.139]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:31:44.139 --> 03:31:44.399]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:31:44.399 --> 03:31:47.842]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:31:47.842 --> 03:31:49.603]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:32:00.387 --> 03:32:04.930]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:32:04.930 --> 03:32:05.850]  Number one.
[03:32:05.850 --> 03:32:09.272]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:32:09.272 --> 03:32:10.132]  Number two.
[03:32:10.132 --> 03:32:15.015]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:32:15.015 --> 03:32:15.755]  It's true.
[03:32:15.755 --> 03:32:20.318]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:32:20.638 --> 03:32:21.458]  Number 3.
[03:32:21.458 --> 03:32:25.040]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:32:25.040 --> 03:32:28.962]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:32:28.962 --> 03:32:29.762]  Number 4.
[03:32:29.762 --> 03:32:32.523]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:32:32.523 --> 03:32:36.205]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:32:36.205 --> 03:32:36.985]  Number 5.
[03:32:36.985 --> 03:32:40.847]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:32:41.127 --> 03:32:46.168]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:32:46.168 --> 03:32:50.349]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:32:50.349 --> 03:32:52.130]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:32:52.130 --> 03:32:56.731]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:33:02.234 --> 03:33:19.140]  By the way, folks, I named a radio talk show host in Austin who took the seasonal, got Guillain-Barré for months, was getting numb all over.
[03:33:19.140 --> 03:33:20.461]  Thank God most of it's gone away.
[03:33:20.461 --> 03:33:22.101]  His toes are still numb.
[03:33:22.101 --> 03:33:25.582]  And the medical doctors in Austin told him it was the vaccine.
[03:33:25.582 --> 03:33:27.123]  Now, this is in the inserts.
[03:33:27.751 --> 03:33:37.160]  And they put out these fake fact sheets at the pharmacies and at the colleges and government buildings saying there's no mercury, can't cause neurological disorders.
[03:33:37.160 --> 03:33:39.822]  But then you get the actual insert which we have up on screen.
[03:33:39.822 --> 03:33:42.445]  We're going to be going over that with Dr. Blaylock.
[03:33:42.445 --> 03:33:49.331]  Now that's what's so frustrating about this because there were big mainstream articles I read attacking Dr. Blaylock and others when he was simply trying to save lives.
[03:33:50.089 --> 03:33:55.233]  I mean, he's a multi-degreed top doctor, somebody who's researched all this.
[03:33:55.233 --> 03:33:57.635]  He's got all the peer-reviewed mainline studies.
[03:33:57.635 --> 03:33:59.656]  As he said, this is not secret.
[03:33:59.656 --> 03:34:02.379]  They know what they're doing, and I'll ask him why.
[03:34:02.379 --> 03:34:06.162]  We're going back to him here in just a moment.
[03:34:06.162 --> 03:34:10.785]  Before we do that, I want to encourage listeners to support this radio broadcast.
[03:34:10.785 --> 03:34:13.647]  That means supporting our local sponsors on AM and FM.
[03:34:13.647 --> 03:34:16.930]  That means spreading the word about, say, the free iPhone app.
[03:34:17.566 --> 03:34:18.727]  Giving us five-star rating.
[03:34:18.727 --> 03:34:20.128]  Be sure and rate it when you get it.
[03:34:20.128 --> 03:34:21.929]  Listen to the show whenever you want, however you want.
[03:34:21.929 --> 03:34:26.071]  If you have friends and family that have iPhones or iPads, send them the link.
[03:34:26.071 --> 03:34:29.293]  It works on the iPad to our iPhone app.
[03:34:29.293 --> 03:34:40.540]  It has archives of the show, live stream, the restreams, the free iPhone app, big banners at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com or you can find it on the Listen tab page.
[03:34:41.603 --> 03:34:46.484]  So expanding on that front, and we also have produced two new films that we released in April.
[03:34:46.484 --> 03:34:52.146]  Normally I release one film at a time, but these two films and their production schedule both got behind.
[03:34:52.146 --> 03:34:56.367]  We spent a year and a half on Invisible Empire, a year on Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[03:34:56.367 --> 03:34:59.328]  They expose this entire agenda, why they're doing it.
[03:34:59.328 --> 03:35:03.949]  It wakes people up so they understand, and your purchase of the high-quality DVDs.
[03:35:04.629 --> 03:35:14.324]  Also supports this radio broadcast so please get Invisible Empire New Order Defined now shipping now available and Police State for the Rise of FEMA now shipping now available getting rave reviews.
[03:35:14.324 --> 03:35:18.611]  I want to thank folks out there for their support with the film or you can download all my films.
[03:35:19.375 --> 03:35:24.740]  The live TV show, the radio show, podcast in higher quality by becoming a PrisonPlanet.TV member.
[03:35:24.740 --> 03:35:27.202]  It's 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month.
[03:35:27.202 --> 03:35:28.863]  Again, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[03:35:28.863 --> 03:35:34.468]  You can also call toll-free to get the books and videos and materials that we have on the website.
[03:35:34.468 --> 03:35:34.968]  888-253-3139.
[03:35:34.968 --> 03:35:35.088]  888-253-3139.
[03:35:35.088 --> 03:35:38.351]  And we've also added four new books to the catalog yesterday.
[03:35:46.692 --> 03:35:52.455]  The Secret Team by Fletcher Prouty, Jesse Ventura's Don't Start the Revolution Without Me, and several other books.
[03:35:52.455 --> 03:35:57.058]  And for a limited time, because when Terror Storm runs out, the price will go back up and I've got to reprint.
[03:35:57.058 --> 03:36:04.142]  The premiere film, Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror, is free with the books right now.
[03:36:04.142 --> 03:36:04.862]  Free.
[03:36:04.862 --> 03:36:06.823]  One of my top films, free.
[03:36:06.823 --> 03:36:11.586]  That's how important it is this film get out to everybody, so that new special is up there on the website.
[03:36:11.586 --> 03:36:13.947]  We couldn't do this without your financial support, so I want to thank you.
[03:36:14.880 --> 03:36:18.021]  Speaking of support, be sure and support Dr. Russell Blaylock.
[03:36:18.021 --> 03:36:25.023]  He has several websites, but what's the best website, doctor, for people to visit?
[03:36:25.023 --> 03:36:29.024]  Go to www.blaylockwellnesscenter.com.
[03:36:34.369 --> 03:36:36.770]  That's BlaylockWellnessCenter.com.
[03:36:36.770 --> 03:36:42.091]  Okay, so I was ranting there about the fact that they know.
[03:36:42.091 --> 03:36:55.795]  I mean, on the insert that really came with the H1N1 and the seasonal, it says, can cause neurological disorder, Guillain-Barré, can reduce fertility, can cause cancer, and we've shown that over and over again, and I believe, and I want you to talk about this,
[03:36:56.555 --> 03:37:17.757]  That not only do we have a record low flu season worldwide, both seasonal and H1N1, but the Wall Street Journal had to admit a month ago, we covered this several times here on air, if anybody wants to pull it up, that it was record low for people taking vaccines and now Canadian studies show, they have four different studies, I'm sure you've seen them, but it's in mainstream news, even MSNBC,
[03:37:18.826 --> 03:37:24.827]  Yeah, that Canadian study came out right in the middle of all of this and they were still screaming that you need to get the vaccine.
[03:37:24.827 --> 03:37:27.828]  The Canadian study showed that if you took the vaccine,
[03:37:42.998 --> 03:37:47.459]  It at least doubled your risk of contracting H1N1.
[03:37:47.459 --> 03:37:51.780]  An Indian study out of India found the same thing.
[03:37:51.780 --> 03:37:54.740]  Yet it had no impact on the U.S.
[03:37:54.740 --> 03:37:55.300]  policy.
[03:37:55.300 --> 03:37:57.641]  It did the Canadian policy.
[03:37:57.641 --> 03:38:07.903]  A lot of my material was going to a friend of mine in the Czech Republic, and she was translating into Czech, and it was going throughout the media.
[03:38:08.809 --> 03:38:16.876]  Well, interestingly, the Secretary of Health for the Czech Republic was encouraging everyone to get the vaccine.
[03:38:16.876 --> 03:38:18.537]  Instead, she took it.
[03:38:18.537 --> 03:38:21.479]  The President of the Czech Republic said he wouldn't take it.
[03:38:21.479 --> 03:38:24.161]  He was scared of the vaccine.
[03:38:24.161 --> 03:38:27.064]  Well, guess who got the infection?
[03:38:27.064 --> 03:38:29.085]  The Secretary of Health, rather than get H1N1.
[03:38:30.683 --> 03:38:35.004]  They had 1 million doses of the vaccine ordered for the Czech Republic.
[03:38:35.004 --> 03:38:38.045]  They have 800,000 doses that are sitting.
[03:38:38.045 --> 03:38:39.685]  No one will take it.
[03:38:39.685 --> 03:38:45.767]  So the vast majority of people listened to the advice and didn't take the vaccine.
[03:38:45.767 --> 03:38:49.088]  Now, the thing is, people need to understand about vaccines.
[03:38:49.088 --> 03:38:52.929]  This is not just the H1N1, but all vaccines.
[03:38:52.929 --> 03:38:57.010]  The big secret in the vaccine manufacturing is that they're all contaminated.
[03:38:57.822 --> 03:39:05.366]  And they admit they don't know how to get contaminating viruses and microplasma out of these vaccines.
[03:39:05.366 --> 03:39:07.768]  It's impossible.
[03:39:07.768 --> 03:39:10.569]  Their top experts have admitted that.
[03:39:10.569 --> 03:39:16.513]  The other thing is almost all the vaccines are now manufactured in China.
[03:39:16.513 --> 03:39:24.597]  The United States FDA is not allowed to enter any plant that manufactures vaccines in China.
[03:39:24.597 --> 03:39:26.999]  They allow it to come once every 12 years.
[03:39:28.419 --> 03:39:33.400]  And they can look at the record that the Chinese Communist officials give them.
[03:39:34.321 --> 03:39:37.362]  And that's how they made the determination that it's safe.
[03:39:37.362 --> 03:39:38.283]  Let's say that again.
[03:39:38.283 --> 03:39:58.131]  The Communist Chinese, who have a eugenics policy, one-child policy, that meshes with the people that run our government, they're making, in some numbers I've seen, upwards of 90% of the vaccines that we take in Europe and the United States, but more so in the U.S., are being made by China.
[03:39:58.131 --> 03:39:59.031]  I mean, this is amazing.
[03:40:00.632 --> 03:40:09.900]  Well, these are the Chinese that contaminated a cough syrup that's estimated to have killed at least 10,000 people worldwide.
[03:40:09.900 --> 03:40:14.144]  They contaminated baby food.
[03:40:14.144 --> 03:40:20.389]  You know, they've been involved in numerous scandals of contaminating products all over the world.
[03:40:20.389 --> 03:40:27.295]  And yet we turn over something like vaccinations to the Chinese government, and we're not even allowed to look inside their factories.
[03:40:28.491 --> 03:40:29.231]  I don't think so.
[03:40:48.689 --> 03:41:08.264]  Well, just two weeks ago, doctor, it was in the news that millions of vaccines have this pig cancer virus in it, and I've read the government reports declassified in the 70s that over 100 million Americans were given the polio vaccine that had H, what is it, SV40, which gives people cancer.
[03:41:08.264 --> 03:41:16.670]  Yeah, and they've proven that the really scary thing of this SV40, the polio vaccine, is that it's vertically transmitted.
[03:41:16.670 --> 03:41:17.331]  It's communicable.
[03:41:17.896 --> 03:41:17.936]  Um...
[03:41:54.259 --> 03:42:08.014]  Well, more than that, I saw an Indian study, and correct me if I'm wrong, this was years ago, that was in the major Indian papers, that 100% of their municipal sewer systems were filled with SV40 from the vaccines, and not only is it intergenerational,
[03:42:08.912 --> 03:42:18.414]  Passed on from parent to parent, from parents to children, their offspring, but that it is transmittable from person to person.
[03:42:18.414 --> 03:42:24.416]  Yeah, and this is a big worry because this is a major carcinogenic virus.
[03:42:24.416 --> 03:42:34.118]  You know, and the government scientists have just gone bent over backwards to try to make the case that this is not a dangerous virus.
[03:42:34.118 --> 03:42:37.019]  Forever they denied it was even a carcinogenic virus.
[03:42:37.897 --> 03:42:43.002]  Until it was absolutely proven in an NIH lab.
[03:42:43.002 --> 03:42:52.852]  Then, since then, they said, well, we'll do epidemiologic studies in the United States and see if there's any increased cancer since we've given the polio vaccine.
[03:42:52.852 --> 03:42:56.976]  And so they came out with a big denial where we didn't see any increased cancer rates.
[03:42:56.976 --> 03:43:02.181]  Well, the people that know about epidemiology studies said, well, the study was fixed, so it wouldn't show.
[03:43:03.423 --> 03:43:13.735]  Uh, and so, uh, you know, now that they've actually typed the virus and, uh, from the tumors themselves, there's no denying it's not a contaminant.
[03:43:13.735 --> 03:43:14.977]  It is the causation.
[03:43:15.572 --> 03:43:15.973]  I think?
[03:43:34.557 --> 03:43:52.920]  Newspapers and then we see I mean I've talked to other medical doctors I'm gonna ask you if this is true but that 30 40 50 years ago when they were in residency finishing up their medical degree that they would take them into the ward and show them a 10 year old with cancer and it was like finding a four-leaf clover or a leprechaun it was so rare
[03:43:53.420 --> 03:44:03.805]  And now everywhere I go there's five ten-year-old kids just dying everywhere of cancers, and many times it's linked to formerly rare cancers that have been conclusively proven to be tied in with the SV40.
[03:44:03.805 --> 03:44:04.865]  So A, can you speak to that?
[03:44:04.865 --> 03:44:08.247]  And then B, come on, we know this isn't an accident.
[03:44:08.247 --> 03:44:10.188]  I mean, they're eugenicists.
[03:44:10.188 --> 03:44:14.090]  We have all these government documents where they want to reduce our numbers.
[03:44:14.090 --> 03:44:17.351]  Well, it is true about the incidence of these cancers.
[03:44:19.168 --> 03:44:32.591]  And all of us older guys talk about that, how these cancers we're seeing now were so rare, you were lucky to see one or two cases in medical school and in your residency training.
[03:44:32.591 --> 03:44:35.872]  Now, we're just seeing them everywhere.
[03:44:35.872 --> 03:44:39.652]  Things like pancreatic cancer used to be extremely rare.
[03:44:39.652 --> 03:44:43.593]  Lymphoma was nowhere near the incidence that it is now.
[03:44:43.593 --> 03:44:45.694]  Now it is the number one malignancy in 30-year-olds.
[03:44:47.985 --> 03:44:50.528]  Uh, and rising all the time.
[03:44:50.528 --> 03:44:54.912]  Uh, so we're seeing a great number of diseases, and even things like asthma.
[03:44:54.912 --> 03:45:04.760]  Asthma has increased, uh, over tenfold in the last couple of decades, and it's estimated that it's the vaccine program that's producing it.
[03:45:04.760 --> 03:45:08.284]  Why is it causing a heightened over-autoimmune response?
[03:45:08.284 --> 03:45:14.149]  Yeah, it's an auto, uh, autoimmune response from the, uh, component in the vaccine.
[03:45:14.824 --> 03:45:19.105]  And we also know that type 1 diabetes, juvenile diabetes, is related to vaccines.
[03:45:19.105 --> 03:45:24.707]  There's a new study that just came out and made a very strong case for it.
[03:45:24.707 --> 03:45:39.271]  Yet their attitude is, well, it's more important that we vaccinate everybody than we worry about a couple of hundred thousand kids who are crippled every year and thousands who will die from complications of these vaccines.
[03:45:39.271 --> 03:45:44.513]  And you're talking about contaminating the whole population with these viruses that are contaminated.
[03:45:44.991 --> 03:45:46.551]  You can't get rid of the virus.
[03:45:46.551 --> 03:45:49.992]  These viruses are incorporated in your genetic structure.
[03:45:49.992 --> 03:45:52.393]  They're passed on to your children and grandchildren.
[03:45:52.393 --> 03:45:55.674]  Let me stop you again, because there's so many points I want to cover with you.
[03:45:55.674 --> 03:45:56.354]  This is incredible.
[03:45:56.354 --> 03:45:57.115]  I'll have to do a part two.
[03:45:57.115 --> 03:46:01.896]  You're so gracious to spend this time with us.
[03:46:01.896 --> 03:46:12.259]  Going back, and I just had the article up on screen, mainstream news reported, and this was going on in April and May and June of last year, that
[03:46:13.166 --> 03:46:35.847]  Last year's seasonal flu and this year's seasonal flu, some of the major companies were putting an H1N1 simulant and then I had medical doctors on that explained that viral simulant was really an attenuated virus and so now that's why they're saying you take the seasonal flu then you get H1N1 which is what four different studies out of Canada and you mentioned one out of India have shown.
[03:46:37.947 --> 03:46:47.031]  So please speak to that, but then overall, second question, is it the good news that we're having record numbers of people refuse vaccines because people are finally getting wise to this?
[03:46:47.031 --> 03:46:48.572]  Go ahead.
[03:46:48.572 --> 03:46:57.677]  Well, you know, it's true that they're manipulating these vaccines all the time, and they're not telling the public what they're doing.
[03:46:57.677 --> 03:47:06.561]  You know, they're putting viruses in, they're putting antigens in these vaccines, and no one's telling the public what's being added to these vaccines.
[03:47:08.596 --> 03:47:20.322]  Now, your second observation, what's happening is, secretly, since we've had this disaster with H1N1, we should have been the learning lesson.
[03:47:20.322 --> 03:47:32.468]  Right at that time, Merck Pharmaceutical was secretly going through the state legislation to get them to overturn exemption law so that you couldn't refuse the vaccine.
[03:47:33.765 --> 03:47:40.751]  Because they were so upset that so many people have refused the vaccine in this season.
[03:47:40.751 --> 03:47:45.955]  And right here in my own state, I know of this action taking place.
[03:47:45.955 --> 03:47:58.745]  And in your state, you know, Governor Perry was getting the Gardasil as a mandatory vaccine because he was getting money from Merck Pharmaceuticals.
[03:47:58.745 --> 03:48:01.467]  So our state politicians
[03:48:02.379 --> 03:48:10.942]  Uh, are people we need to keep an eye on because they're going to override exemptions to these vaccines and force people to do it.
[03:48:10.942 --> 03:48:21.346]  Uh, the other thing, this new healthcare bill that was passed, if anybody bothers to read it, inside it said all vaccines recommended by the CDC will be made available.
[03:48:21.346 --> 03:48:23.547]  Well, that doesn't just mean made available.
[03:48:23.547 --> 03:48:24.567]  It means you will take them.
[03:48:25.536 --> 03:48:27.757]  Or you cannot get healthcare in the United States.
[03:48:45.846 --> 03:49:00.121]  Statistically, one of the most dangerous vaccines ever, this cancer virus, and then the insert admitted it didn't even protect you, but from a few strains, and there's thousands of these things, and then Rick Perry came out and said, you must take it, which was another hoax.
[03:49:00.121 --> 03:49:07.368]  He just put it on the list of recommended to the health department, and now they want to make boys take it, and people are dying all over, and they just don't give a damn!
[03:49:08.174 --> 03:49:18.119]  Well, it's a worthless vaccine, and there's a new study out that shows that just increasing certain nutrients in your diet reduces cervical cancer by 85%.
[03:49:18.119 --> 03:49:22.081]  Well, that vaccine is nowhere near that effective.
[03:49:22.081 --> 03:49:30.886]  So if you truly wanted to prevent cervical cancer in young girls, all you need to do is give them a couple of nutrient supplements.
[03:49:30.886 --> 03:49:34.448]  But, of course, they would never do that, because it's a big profit for the vaccine.
[03:49:34.448 --> 03:49:36.009]  Or not let them have sex with people.
[03:49:36.889 --> 03:49:50.220]  Sure, I mean, you could do something really drastic and that is re-establish a moral principle in which you're not having sex with everybody you meet in the shopping mall.
[03:49:50.220 --> 03:50:04.271]  But, you know, that's so drastic according to the collectivist's left-wing viewpoint, we can't dare turn back the clock because that would just violate the laws of the universe, according to their way of thinking.
[03:50:05.034 --> 03:50:09.196]  You know, we've got to re-establish the foundation of morality.
[03:50:09.196 --> 03:50:25.882]  We've got to re-establish these things and just tell the far left and the extreme social engineers we're no longer going to listen to their nonsense because everything they've engineered in the last 70 years is about disaster.
[03:50:25.882 --> 03:50:28.923]  I mean, the whole sex education thing was their idea.
[03:50:28.923 --> 03:50:32.044]  It was going to stop teenage pregnancies.
[03:50:32.044 --> 03:50:34.505]  It was going to stop the spread of venereal disease.
[03:50:34.980 --> 03:50:40.664]  Well, both have arisen astronomically since their brilliant post-menstrual growth.
[03:50:40.664 --> 03:50:43.546]  Well, their brilliant eugenics plan.
[03:50:43.546 --> 03:50:43.866]  Absolutely.
[03:50:43.866 --> 03:50:44.907]  Doctor, we've got to break again.
[03:50:44.907 --> 03:50:45.407]  Stay there.
[03:50:45.407 --> 03:50:49.270]  Amazing information with our guest, Dr. Russell Blaylock.
[03:50:49.270 --> 03:50:53.652]  We'll give you his website again and tell you about all the great materials he has there so you can educate yourself.
[03:50:53.652 --> 03:50:58.936]  We're honored to really have a great patriot who's really probably saved hundreds of thousands of people on the show with us.
[03:51:01.690 --> 03:51:06.913]  How well and how fast does heart and body extract work to improve blood circulation?
[03:51:06.913 --> 03:51:07.613]  Listen.
[03:51:07.613 --> 03:51:11.875]  My name is Ellis and I'm 66 years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[03:51:11.875 --> 03:51:15.277]  Two years ago, I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[03:51:15.277 --> 03:51:18.318]  I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[03:51:18.318 --> 03:51:21.700]  They wanted me to go on Plavix, but I refused knowing the negative side effects.
[03:51:22.099 --> 03:51:30.503]  Heart and Body Extract is a unique balance, synergy, and proportion of herbs reaching from head to toe at maximum absorption around 95% at the cellular level.
[03:51:30.503 --> 03:51:33.065]  Within the first month, I felt a dramatic difference.
[03:51:33.065 --> 03:51:37.687]  The heaviness in my legs was reduced and within two months, I felt completely normal.

[03:52:00.951 --> 03:52:03.312]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:52:03.312 --> 03:52:05.633]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:52:05.633 --> 03:52:08.855]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:52:08.855 --> 03:52:13.957]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:52:13.957 --> 03:52:18.159]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:52:18.459 --> 03:52:20.922]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:52:20.922 --> 03:52:23.365]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:52:23.365 --> 03:52:26.609]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:52:26.609 --> 03:52:34.198]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:52:34.551 --> 03:52:39.955]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:52:39.955 --> 03:52:42.798]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:52:42.798 --> 03:52:46.481]  So it's gonna be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:52:46.481 --> 03:52:47.561]  And I got news for you.
[03:52:47.561 --> 03:52:48.902]  You're everyone else.
[03:52:48.902 --> 03:52:50.404]  Invisible Empire.

[03:53:53.664 --> 03:53:54.905]  Laylock Wellness Center.
[03:53:54.905 --> 03:54:01.826]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll put it up on screen for folks.
[03:54:01.826 --> 03:54:06.247]  LaylockWellnessCenter.com.
[03:54:13.727 --> 03:54:17.468]  Dr. Bloodluck with us five minutes to the next hour and a bunch of other important news coming up.
[03:54:17.468 --> 03:54:20.389]  But look, I didn't just read stuff on the internet.
[03:54:20.389 --> 03:54:22.789]  I sent off to universities, to the UN.
[03:54:22.789 --> 03:54:27.070]  I got the actual biological diversity assessments.
[03:54:27.070 --> 03:54:36.513]  We have over a hundred books written by top scientists, the White House science czar, John P. Holdren, the head of the UN, all of them.
[03:54:36.513 --> 03:54:42.274]  All they talk about is putting things in your food, water, and your vaccines to sterilize you and dumb you down.
[03:54:44.371 --> 03:54:48.254]  I know that sounds horrible and hard to believe, but I mean, here's the Times of London.
[03:54:48.254 --> 03:54:49.675]  It was also on ABC News.
[03:54:49.675 --> 03:54:52.757]  Billionaire club and bid to curb overpopulation.
[03:54:52.757 --> 03:54:56.420]  And it says America's richest people met in secret at Rockefeller University.
[03:54:56.420 --> 03:55:01.344]  And at the end it says for a world government to carry out population reduction.
[03:55:01.344 --> 03:55:05.688]  And I've got CNN here yesterday calling for a one-child policy.
[03:55:05.688 --> 03:55:07.089]  Listen, there's a reason China
[03:55:07.930 --> 03:55:13.554]  Is at the heart of this New World Order, and they're making your shots, and it makes you have miscarriages and get cancer.
[03:55:13.554 --> 03:55:15.055]  I mean, this is a fact.
[03:55:15.055 --> 03:55:25.701]  Dr. Blaylock, getting down to that point, I mean, you're a medical doctor, brain surgeon, scientist, but we've talked before, and you've been criticized by the media for your courage, but you're just reading, I mean, you've read the same documents I've read.
[03:55:25.701 --> 03:55:32.406]  I mean, am I joking around when I say the elite are saying they want to do this to us, and then 2 plus 2 equals 4?
[03:55:32.406 --> 03:55:32.986]  It's happening?
[03:55:34.249 --> 03:55:59.081]  Well, there's been a great number of books written about population control, which if you're really interested, if you have any questions about this, as you say, you can get on government websites, you can get on foundations, there's a number of powerful foundations that are supplying billions of dollars for this purpose, world population control.
[03:55:59.784 --> 03:56:04.086]  And if you read the literature, I mean, these are some of the most powerful people in the world.
[03:56:04.086 --> 03:56:24.578]  If you read their literature, they openly talk about how we've got to drastically reduce the population of the world, and how everybody that survives this population control are going to benefit enormously, because so much land will be available, it'll be easier to feed the population, there'll be less disease, on and on and on.
[03:56:24.578 --> 03:56:26.919]  They give all this justification.
[03:56:27.512 --> 03:56:32.276]  Well, there's a lot of people in powerful positions who believe this.
[03:56:32.276 --> 03:56:36.439]  I've had a number of my physician colleagues who agree with it.
[03:56:36.439 --> 03:56:42.543]  And the doctor's lounge will tell you, well, I think that the population needs to be drastically reduced.
[03:56:42.543 --> 03:56:43.644]  Let me interrupt you again.
[03:56:43.644 --> 03:56:46.607]  My dad, you know, he's an oral surgeon and dentist.
[03:56:46.607 --> 03:56:48.448]  He has a lot of physician friends.
[03:56:48.448 --> 03:56:54.392]  And when he went to college, he said in the 60s, this was the majority view.
[03:56:54.392 --> 03:56:55.894]  And what these people don't understand is,
[03:56:57.409 --> 03:56:59.310]  These physicians aren't elitist either.
[03:56:59.310 --> 03:57:00.690]  Their kids are taking this stuff.
[03:57:00.690 --> 03:57:05.492]  See, the average yuppie doctor, and I want to get your comment on this, they think they're immune for this.
[03:57:05.492 --> 03:57:09.734]  You know, it's fine to, yeah, we're spiking those black people shots in Africa.
[03:57:09.734 --> 03:57:15.496]  What these immoral people, control freaks on power trips don't get is this is being done to everybody, isn't it?
[03:57:15.496 --> 03:57:22.299]  Well, you're exactly right, and it's the delusion that somehow they're going to be in the group that's going to be spared.
[03:57:23.672 --> 03:57:31.878]  And when you look at the history of this collectivist movement, those are the people that are going to be included in the ones to be removed.
[03:57:31.878 --> 03:57:43.505]  You know, I spoke on your program one time about Dr. Lilly, who wrote the Molecular Visions of Life, which was the history of molecular biology in America.
[03:57:43.505 --> 03:57:48.128]  Well, she is a very highly regarded historian of molecular science.
[03:57:48.757 --> 03:57:49.998]  And that's what the book's about.
[03:57:49.998 --> 03:58:06.849]  But he goes in great detail, showing how the Rockefeller family had engineered with all of their friends, these multimillionaires, particularly through the foundation, a program to cause drastic reductions in human population.
[03:58:06.849 --> 03:58:09.110]  He was absolutely obsessed with it.
[03:58:09.110 --> 03:58:18.216]  Now, this is one of the wealthiest men in the entire world, owns tens of thousands of corporations, either directly or indirectly.
[03:58:18.835 --> 03:58:27.560]  Uh, one of the major forces that created the Council of Foreign Relations, by allowing permission, uh, powerfully influenced Bill to burn all the Internet.
[03:58:27.560 --> 03:58:29.000]  Doc, Doc, one more segment.
[03:58:29.000 --> 03:58:30.421]  One minute break, we're coming back to you.
[03:58:30.421 --> 03:58:37.184]  Finish up with that point, then let's talk about these eugenicists now having government death care over our lives.
[03:58:37.184 --> 03:58:42.307]  What this means.
