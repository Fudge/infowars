[00:00:05.151 --> 00:00:06.452]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.452 --> 00:00:08.233]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.233 --> 00:00:09.994]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.994 --> 00:00:11.595]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:13.115]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.115 --> 00:00:17.317]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:21.419]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.182 --> 00:00:30.966]  Well, for the next 20 minutes, Judge Andrew Napolitano joins us.
[00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:46.799]  He, of course, for the last week has now moved from the weekends with the number one show in months, well out of the gates was number one on Fox Business, on the weekends to the regular Fox Business weeknights and it's becoming very, very successful there as well.
[00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:53.264]  So from the weekends to weekdays and hopefully very soon to the main Fox Channel because he's a real libertarian at heart.
[00:00:53.624 --> 00:01:01.334]  And we always appreciate having Judge Andrew Napolitano, JudgeNap.com, also best-selling author, with us.
[00:01:01.334 --> 00:01:05.800]  Judge, this is a short segment, the long segment's coming up, but so much going on in the world today.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.723]  What's most important on your radar?
[00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:11.774]  I think the President wants to subjugate us, Alex.
[00:01:11.774 --> 00:01:23.047]  I think the President, who falsely claims that he believes in civil liberties, who took an oath to uphold the Constitution, and who could stop all of this with a phone call to Cousin Janet.
[00:01:23.047 --> 00:01:26.851]  We're not related, but I kiddingly referred to her that way, John Napolitano.
[00:01:27.852 --> 00:01:28.233]  I think so.
[00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:45.865]  I don't know.
[00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:12.696]  Well, we know, and you were critical of George Bush and the police state things he carried out.
[00:02:12.696 --> 00:02:20.643]  Obama's continued the torture of the wars, in some cases expanded some of the extraordinary rendition, the enhanced interrogations.
[00:02:20.643 --> 00:02:27.168]  But because he's got a leftist cover, the left has been in a coma dealing with it.
[00:02:27.168 --> 00:02:29.390]  But now this TSA, hands in pants,
[00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:35.233]  And we've got all of this happening.
[00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:42.394]  I mean, it really does show their lust to dominate us and to basically break those taboos.
[00:02:42.394 --> 00:02:43.214]  And you're right.
[00:02:43.214 --> 00:02:46.175]  They've announced they want TSA scanners on the streets.
[00:02:46.175 --> 00:02:48.395]  They're already beta testing it at train stations.
[00:02:48.395 --> 00:02:51.676]  TSA has been searching people's bags without warrants for years in New York.
[00:02:51.676 --> 00:02:52.596]  So you're right.
[00:02:52.596 --> 00:02:54.597]  I mean, this is something they want to roll out nationwide.
[00:02:56.477 --> 00:02:57.258]  I don't know.
[00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:16.436]  Houses, papers, and effects.
[00:03:16.436 --> 00:03:19.399]  In their persons, meaning their bodies.
[00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:24.564]  And the Supreme Court has ruled, in some cases with which you and I agree, and in some with which you and I disagree.
[00:03:24.564 --> 00:03:29.108]  Nevertheless, it has uniformly ruled that you own your body.
[00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:38.277]  And the government cannot touch it, or go near it, or go inside of it, without an order from a judge, after the judge has heard arguments from both sides.
[00:03:45.914 --> 00:04:02.171]  The ESA, not by a law that Congress wrote, but by a regulation written by a couple of faceless bureaucrats, nameless until a few weeks ago, has turned that presumption of innocence upside down and treats everyone as if they were entering a prison rather than getting onto a private airliner.
[00:04:03.268 --> 00:04:14.414]  Absolutely, and expanding on that, they are having federally funded checkpoints that violate the Fourth Amendment, federally funded blood draws at DWI checkpoints, no refusal.
[00:04:14.414 --> 00:04:16.956]  They're trying to push forced inoculations.
[00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:22.659]  This is clearly their attempt to set the precedent to get in our space and put their hands on our body.
[00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:26.201]  And Ron Paul told me an hour and a half ago that they've grabbed his genitals.
[00:04:27.186 --> 00:04:28.227]  I did not know that.
[00:04:28.227 --> 00:04:29.768]  Ron was on with me last night.
[00:04:29.768 --> 00:04:35.092]  Ron made an argument which was purely Jeffersonian in its brilliance and its simplicity.
[00:04:35.092 --> 00:04:36.833]  Well, tell us about that when we come back, Judge.
[00:04:36.833 --> 00:04:37.874]  I want to hear that.
[00:04:37.874 --> 00:04:38.874]  But I want to go further.
[00:04:38.874 --> 00:04:42.117]  I want to ask you as a judge, as a constitutional scholar,
[00:04:42.757 --> 00:04:43.958]  Not just the Fourth Amendment.
[00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.499]  Am I wrong in saying this violates Ninth and Tenth?
[00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:54.083]  We've got a federal power grab that, you know, even sworn peace officers of the state can't stick their hands down your pants without an emergency or a warrant.
[00:04:54.083 --> 00:04:55.744]  I mean, how are they doing this?
[00:04:55.744 --> 00:04:58.586]  We'll be right back with Judge Andrew Napolitano at JudgeNap.com.
[00:05:01.243 --> 00:05:02.984]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:02.984 --> 00:05:08.705]  You've heard me talk about the delicious, easy-to-fix, and very storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:05:08.705 --> 00:05:13.447]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.
[00:05:13.447 --> 00:05:17.208]  Now it's that time of year again, and their holiday special is here.
[00:05:17.208 --> 00:05:24.130]  They have two holiday price packs for you to put into your reserves for a secure future or to share with others.
[00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.951]  The first is a six-month bulk supply in 10 cans.
[00:05:27.891 --> 00:05:35.434]  And the second is a five-week supply of quick and easy-to-fix meals, including delicious bakery items shipped in heavy tote bags.
[00:05:35.434 --> 00:05:42.497]  Now, for a limited time, when you order two or more of these special holiday packs, you'll get free shipping on your entire order.
[00:05:42.497 --> 00:05:46.539]  Call now, 800-409-5633, or visit them at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.100]  That's 800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:05.429]  Big Brother.
[00:06:05.429 --> 00:06:07.190]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.970]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.551]  You want answers?
[00:06:10.551 --> 00:06:12.091]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:12.091 --> 00:06:16.292]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:16.292 --> 00:06:20.394]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:06:22.555 --> 00:06:24.957]  Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[00:06:24.957 --> 00:06:30.401]  His show's now moved from Fox Business Weekends, number one, to Fox Business Weeknights.
[00:06:30.401 --> 00:06:34.224]  You can find out more on his website.
[00:06:34.224 --> 00:06:37.186]  He's gonna have Jerome Corsi on tonight.
[00:06:37.186 --> 00:06:39.488]  We'll find out what's coming up on his show tonight.
[00:06:39.488 --> 00:06:40.208]  I love seeing...
[00:06:41.209 --> 00:06:44.932]  Fox promotes somebody like Napolitano because he tells the truth.
[00:06:44.932 --> 00:06:46.393]  He's a constitutionalist.
[00:06:46.393 --> 00:06:48.875]  He was against Bush when he was pushing tyranny.
[00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:51.076]  He's against Obama when he's pushing tyranny.
[00:06:51.076 --> 00:06:53.138]  He talks about the New World Order.
[00:06:53.138 --> 00:06:56.180]  If you just joined us, we were discussing the TSA in the last segment.
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.884]  You were getting into Ron Paul who you interviewed last night and his Jeffersonian argument against the TSA.
[00:07:01.884 --> 00:07:02.305]  Go ahead.
[00:07:02.685 --> 00:07:17.289]  Ron Paul made the same argument that Jefferson did, which is interestingly the same argument that the now iconic, heroic young man from San Diego made at the San Diego airport two weeks ago when he said, don't touch my junk, referring to his private parts.
[00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:19.010]  If I can't do it to you,
[00:07:20.123 --> 00:07:24.628]  Then I can't give the government the power to do it to you.
[00:07:24.628 --> 00:07:27.931]  If you take a swing at me, I can take a swing back.
[00:07:27.931 --> 00:07:35.198]  But I can't invite you onto my property and presume the right to touch your private parts as a condition of your coming onto the property.
[00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:41.141]  Stated differently, the only powers the government has are the powers we give it.
[00:07:41.141 --> 00:07:44.902]  And the only powers we give it are the powers that we have to give it.
[00:07:44.902 --> 00:07:51.304]  We don't have the power to touch someone else in their private parts against their will.
[00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:54.305]  No matter what they're doing, it's a sexual assault.
[00:07:54.305 --> 00:07:59.206]  Whether it's done by the gardener, by a school teacher, by a member of the clergy, or by
[00:07:59.326 --> 00:08:01.509]  Somebody wearing a government uniform.
[00:08:01.509 --> 00:08:11.661]  Congressman Paul not only articulated that so nicely on my show, he introduced a piece of legislation that's ten lines long, which would stop this in a heartbeat.
[00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:13.364]  But it will never see the heart of day.
[00:08:13.364 --> 00:08:14.205]  Why do you think?
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:27.029]  Speaker-designate John Boehner, who flies commercial from Cincinnati to Washington several days a week, was permitted to walk around the scanners and around the gropers.
[00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:28.490]  Is it because they recognize him?
[00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:29.892]  Well, of course they recognize him.
[00:08:30.792 --> 00:08:37.276]  So this is true discrimination at its heart, but what about my point that this violates the 9th and 10th Amendment?
[00:08:37.276 --> 00:08:39.437]  I guess that goes to the Jeffersonians.
[00:08:49.802 --> 00:09:01.390]  The 10th Amendment says that the powers not given to the federal government are retained by the states and the people, and we never gave, the Constitution nowhere gave the federal government the power to keep us safe.
[00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.552]  That is the obligation of the individuals and of the states.
[00:09:04.552 --> 00:09:15.260]  And the 9th Amendment says, just because we have enumerated certain rights in this Constitution, it doesn't mean that there are other natural rights that the people don't have.
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.422]  Stated differently, your right to bodily integrity
[00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:22.125]  You have it, whether it's mentioned in the Constitution or not.
[00:09:22.125 --> 00:09:23.066]  It's a natural.
[00:09:23.066 --> 00:09:25.028]  So Judge, what is this attempt then?
[00:09:25.028 --> 00:09:26.690]  What do you think's behind this?
[00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:34.577]  They know brazenly ordering them to put their hands down the pants now and to record our naked images of our body, which they've been caught doing.
[00:09:34.577 --> 00:09:35.098]  They know.
[00:09:35.458 --> 00:09:39.383]  This is 180 degrees polar opposite of a liberty culture.
[00:09:39.383 --> 00:09:41.024]  It's a tyranny culture.
[00:09:41.024 --> 00:09:44.388]  So, is this the Fuhrer precept that Bush tried?
[00:09:44.388 --> 00:09:47.892]  Where they said, well, it's not illegal when the president does it.
[00:09:47.892 --> 00:09:51.616]  Torture is illegal, but it's not illegal if the president orders it.
[00:09:51.616 --> 00:09:56.222]  Is this just more of this control freak religion of pushing it to the limit?
[00:09:56.602 --> 00:10:03.825]  It's more of a control freak progressive with an uppercase T religion that the government can do whatever it wants.
[00:10:03.825 --> 00:10:06.546]  Look, this morning there were two polls, very dismaying.
[00:10:06.546 --> 00:10:10.848]  One said two-thirds of the American public doesn't object to the porn or the grope.
[00:10:10.848 --> 00:10:14.930]  Well, most of the public doesn't fly every day and they haven't exposed to this.
[00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:21.313]  But the more terrifying one is that 53% of Americans think the government is operating outside the Constitution.
[00:10:21.793 --> 00:10:23.858]  And aren't doing anything about it.
[00:10:23.858 --> 00:10:28.988]  If the government is operating outside the Constitution, it's time to change the government.
[00:10:28.988 --> 00:10:31.493]  I mean, that's about as reckless a thing as it could be.
[00:10:34.684 --> 00:10:35.044]  It's not
[00:10:58.985 --> 00:11:01.087]  So it's judge, jury, and executioner.
[00:11:01.087 --> 00:11:05.173]  I think the establishment's going to lose this fight.
[00:11:05.173 --> 00:11:10.199]  I mean, I really see this becoming a focal point of people's anger in general.
[00:11:10.199 --> 00:11:15.206]  You know, I agree with you, Alex, and I've seen some people that I'm surprised to see on our side.
[00:11:16.086 --> 00:11:22.330]  Former Senator Rick Santorum, who almost always sided with big government, sounded like Alex Jones this morning.
[00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:30.474]  Peter King, Republican congressman from Long Island, who always sides with security, said the TSA has become the enemy of the American people.
[00:11:30.474 --> 00:11:34.616]  Congressman John Micah, who wrote the TSA legislation, says we have to change this
[00:11:34.636 --> 00:11:35.617]  Yes, immediately.
[00:11:35.617 --> 00:11:40.139]  I think this is starting to sink in across the board.
[00:11:40.139 --> 00:11:44.381]  It knows no ideological, no ethnic, no gender line.
[00:11:44.381 --> 00:11:46.723]  I think the American public is saying enough is enough.
[00:11:46.723 --> 00:11:52.626]  But one person isn't listening, and he could stop this with a phone call.
[00:11:52.626 --> 00:12:01.951]  And that's the president who wants to induce us to conform to his way of behaving and thinking, just like his predecessor.
[00:12:03.717 --> 00:12:05.379]  That's Barack H. Obama.
[00:12:22.581 --> 00:12:22.922]  I don't know.
[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:49.688]  They need a larger war so that the dollar stays strong and so that countries basically go along with the formation of this corporate world government.
[00:12:49.688 --> 00:12:50.948]  And Ron Paul agreed with me.
[00:12:50.948 --> 00:12:57.753]  He said that certainly we have to look at the military-industrial complex staging this provocation.
[00:12:57.753 --> 00:12:59.335]  Not that North Korea is good.
[00:12:59.335 --> 00:13:03.518]  They're probably the most evil country on earth, this hereditary dictatorship, but
[00:13:04.198 --> 00:13:13.882]  Going into their waters, engaging in a naval exercise, firing artillery near their shore, when the North had warned them, that's clearly a provocation.
[00:13:13.882 --> 00:13:14.743]  What's your take on this?
[00:13:15.287 --> 00:13:18.568]  My take on it is that all presidents love war.
[00:13:18.568 --> 00:13:20.528]  Except that Ron Paul became president.
[00:13:20.528 --> 00:13:22.949]  Because they know that war is the health of the state.
[00:13:22.949 --> 00:13:28.010]  The people will pay more taxes, give up their liberty, and unite behind the soldiers no matter what the outcome.
[00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:31.811]  They falsely believe that war will help the economy.
[00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:39.053]  It's beyond me how taxing people to purchase equipment and then destroying the equipment helps the economy.
[00:13:39.053 --> 00:13:39.933]  But this is a myth.
[00:13:40.353 --> 00:13:49.263]  That has been perpetrated since Woodrow Wilson, reinforced by FDR, used by George W. Bush, and we're about to see if Barack Obama can use it.
[00:13:49.263 --> 00:13:52.326]  Fortunately, this is not in our backyard.
[00:13:52.326 --> 00:13:59.074]  It is 10,000 miles away, and there are voices in both parties on both sides of the aisle are saying, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:13:59.074 --> 00:14:00.415]  We're not going to do this again.
[00:14:00.415 --> 00:14:01.657]  Ron Paul is leading the charge.
[00:14:02.403 --> 00:14:03.043]  All right, Judge.
[00:14:03.043 --> 00:14:08.164]  I've got a few other final questions for you, and then tell us about what's coming up tonight on the TV show.
[00:14:08.164 --> 00:14:12.845]  Glenn Beck, who I've been critical of on many fronts because he's flip-flopped over the years.
[00:14:12.845 --> 00:14:13.266]  You haven't.
[00:14:13.266 --> 00:14:15.206]  That's why I support you and your libertarian views.
[00:14:15.206 --> 00:14:16.926]  We're very close to each other.
[00:14:16.926 --> 00:14:18.587]  But I'm not trying to attack Glenn.
[00:14:18.587 --> 00:14:21.447]  He's given you a big platform to really tell the truth.
[00:14:21.447 --> 00:14:23.188]  But two weeks ago, as you know,
[00:14:24.301 --> 00:14:31.886]  He came out, he read the quotes by Obama and Clinton officials saying how great a terror attack would be, how it would help them.
[00:14:31.886 --> 00:14:39.831]  He read the newsletters where they're demonizing Glenn and myself, saying we're gonna cause an Oklahoma City attack.
[00:14:39.831 --> 00:14:42.212]  And he went ahead and said, these people, this is a quote,
[00:14:43.587 --> 00:14:49.331]  Planning another Oklahoma City to be blamed on the Liberty Movement.
[00:14:49.331 --> 00:14:52.134]  That's a big, bold shift for Glenn Beck.
[00:14:52.134 --> 00:14:55.276]  What's your take on him coming out and talking about false flag terror?
[00:14:55.276 --> 00:14:59.299]  Well, I'm a close friend of Glenn's.
[00:14:59.299 --> 00:15:03.983]  Obviously, I don't have any control over what he says on his show, but I appear with him a lot.
[00:15:03.983 --> 00:15:09.567]  I fill in for him on television when he's not here, and I share a lot of his views.
[00:15:09.567 --> 00:15:13.030]  I don't know anything about what he just said.
[00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:29.951]  But I do believe that this government would welcome the type of conflagration that we have seen in the past if it would help it become more authoritarian, particularly now with the loss of the House and with a filibuster positive number that
[00:15:29.991 --> 00:15:30.051]  Yes.
[00:16:01.767 --> 00:16:05.790]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:09.033]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:16:09.033 --> 00:16:13.817]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:16:13.817 --> 00:16:20.222]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:16:20.222 --> 00:16:22.464]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:16:23.004 --> 00:16:24.485]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:16:24.485 --> 00:16:25.766]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:16:25.766 --> 00:16:28.007]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:16:41.897 --> 00:16:44.019]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:16:44.019 --> 00:16:49.184]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[00:17:52.892 --> 00:17:53.713]  Thank you!
[00:18:00.097 --> 00:18:04.640]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.560]  Number 1.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.983]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:18:08.983 --> 00:18:09.843]  Number 2.
[00:18:09.843 --> 00:18:14.726]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:18:14.726 --> 00:18:15.487]  It's true.
[00:18:15.487 --> 00:18:20.350]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.170]  Number 3.
[00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:24.753]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:18:24.753 --> 00:18:28.455]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:18:28.655 --> 00:18:29.455]  Number 4.
[00:18:29.455 --> 00:18:32.216]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:18:32.216 --> 00:18:35.898]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:18:35.898 --> 00:18:36.698]  Number 5.
[00:18:36.698 --> 00:18:40.840]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:45.882]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:18:45.882 --> 00:18:50.063]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:18:50.063 --> 00:18:51.844]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:18:59.848 --> 00:19:03.691]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.

[00:20:01.404 --> 00:20:05.007]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:20:05.007 --> 00:20:12.774]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:12.774 --> 00:20:18.799]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:20:18.799 --> 00:20:21.341]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:34.147 --> 00:20:38.449]  Ladies and gentlemen, I couldn't think of a better time to have Congressman Ron Paul on with us.
[00:20:38.449 --> 00:20:40.351]  He's only with us about 20 minutes.
[00:20:40.351 --> 00:20:46.554]  I want to get into the Korea situation, the TSA, the quantitative easing too, the monetization of debt.
[00:20:46.554 --> 00:20:58.381]  I want to get into Rand Paul winning and what that signifies, the fact that Ron Paul and Rand Paul have announced that they're not going to be joining the Tea Party Caucus because some of the leaders of it are people that voted for the bailout.
[00:20:58.381 --> 00:20:59.802]  We're going to be discussing all that.
[00:20:59.802 --> 00:21:01.282]  Congressman, thank you for joining us.
[00:21:01.282 --> 00:21:02.103]  Good to be with you again.
[00:21:02.503 --> 00:21:08.148]  Of that constellation of things I threw out, what do you think is most important right now?
[00:21:08.148 --> 00:21:09.268]  Well, the cause of liberty.
[00:21:09.268 --> 00:21:22.339]  That's always my number one goal, and that is related to the deficit, because the bigger the government, the more the government spends, the less liberty we have, and that involves what we do overseas as well as we do here.
[00:21:22.339 --> 00:21:31.105]  So it's been the same old story, and of course that's closely related to our financial system and our Federal Reserve, because it would have been brought to a halt if they couldn't have been
[00:21:32.082 --> 00:21:33.963]  You know, counterfeiting the money.
[00:21:33.963 --> 00:21:50.155]  You know, I'm seeing Wall Street Journal, New York Times headlines every week now saying Ron Paul was right, pointing out that everything you talked about in those debates and got laughed at by a minority of fools has now come true.
[00:21:50.155 --> 00:21:52.917]  What's your view on quantitative easing?
[00:21:52.917 --> 00:21:55.618]  Are you going to get the Banking Committee chairmanship?
[00:21:55.618 --> 00:21:58.861]  Where are you going in your interrogation of the Federal Reserve?
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:05.684]  I'm assuming I'm going to get the chairmanship, but you know, until it's done, you can't be absolutely positive.
[00:22:05.684 --> 00:22:07.786]  But I'm working on the assumption that we will.
[00:22:07.786 --> 00:22:17.493]  And I think most everybody will know where I stand on the Federal Reserve, although my position is to abolish the Fed, and I read a book called In the Fed.
[00:22:17.493 --> 00:22:24.698]  I also take a stand that, you know, even if I could, I wouldn't close the Federal Reserve in one day.
[00:22:24.698 --> 00:22:27.500]  I think they're going to close itself when they have runaway inflation.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.321]  We're good to go.
[00:22:47.957 --> 00:23:00.364]  And just recently some Republicans have come out and they say, you know what we need to do is take away some of the responsibility of the Fed because they're supposed to be, since 1978, they were supposed to deal with unemployment.
[00:23:00.364 --> 00:23:09.529]  Which, you know, it's true that that was a silly thing to do and they've given our, they're the ones who give us the unemployment, they don't, they can't produce employment.
[00:23:10.089 --> 00:23:14.110]  But, you know, removing that is almost irrelevant.
[00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:22.753]  It's the fact that they exist and manipulate interest rates and mess around with the money supply and they're supposed to give us stable prices.
[00:23:22.753 --> 00:23:27.735]  Whether or not they have that additional mandate is missing the whole point.
[00:23:27.735 --> 00:23:28.895]  It's almost a distraction.
[00:23:30.074 --> 00:23:31.876]  Absolutely.
[00:23:31.876 --> 00:23:40.763]  I'm sure you noticed two weeks ago when the Chinese government said they want transparency on the Fed and basically called for an audit.
[00:23:40.763 --> 00:23:46.808]  We now have foreign governments and the biggest owner of our debt calling for some transparency of this group.
[00:23:47.403 --> 00:23:55.590]  Yeah, you know, sometimes when our Congress wants to tell other countries what to do, I object because we ought to mind our own business.
[00:23:55.590 --> 00:24:04.518]  But you know, if you've invested a trillion dollars or nearly a trillion dollars in our dollar, they've almost earned the right to say something about our management of our dollar.
[00:24:04.518 --> 00:24:09.842]  But the hypocrisy is for us to lecture China because we think their currency is too weak.
[00:24:09.842 --> 00:24:10.483]  That's all we do.
[00:24:10.503 --> 00:24:11.063]  We're good to go.
[00:24:37.075 --> 00:24:56.429]  Congressman, is this next session of Congress, the new session starting next year with the Republican majority, do you think in your gut this is going to be the Congress working with your son in the Senate that is finally going to get a real audit of the second largest holder of our debt, the private Federal Reserve?
[00:24:57.697 --> 00:25:00.480]  I think it's going to still be an issue.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:03.702]  I think the auditing will come up again.
[00:25:03.702 --> 00:25:05.284]  There'll be some more votes.
[00:25:05.284 --> 00:25:10.288]  We will get bits and pieces of information that we haven't had before.
[00:25:10.288 --> 00:25:11.229]  But a real audit?
[00:25:11.229 --> 00:25:13.351]  No, I'm not expecting it.
[00:25:13.351 --> 00:25:14.973]  But that doesn't diminish my desire to
[00:25:15.613 --> 00:25:17.374]  Uh, pursue the issue.
[00:25:17.374 --> 00:25:24.196]  Because, you know, even if we did finally get the votes in the Senate and it came out in the bill, the President would probably veto it.
[00:25:24.196 --> 00:25:32.899]  If he didn't veto it, the Fed is going to stonewall us or they'll go to the courts and they'll get a favorable ruling on the courts that they don't have to do it.
[00:25:32.899 --> 00:25:34.300]  So it would go on and on.
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:38.241]  Uh, so it's more likely we're going to find out about the Fed
[00:25:38.781 --> 00:25:48.709]  Well, when they self-destruct, where they really just ruin the system and they no longer function and become irrelevant, people will be forced to use some sound money.
[00:25:48.709 --> 00:25:51.332]  That is a use of gold and silver coins.
[00:25:51.332 --> 00:26:05.984]  I remember three years ago, two years ago, a year ago, you basically, with precision, as a medical doctor, as a congressman, as someone who studies economics and has won awards in that area, that as time went on you saw the
[00:26:06.904 --> 00:26:13.850]  The self-destruction of this system through dollar devaluation coming.
[00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:16.972]  Obviously, we're getting closer to that.
[00:26:16.972 --> 00:26:19.034]  What type of time frame do you see, Congressman?
[00:26:19.977 --> 00:26:27.960]  Well, that's what's, you know, not possible to predict, and everybody wants to know, investors need to know, or they need to make estimates.
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:43.765]  I work on the assumption that it could come any time, because there's no foundation to our system, no foundation to our money, no support for the currency other than the promises of our politicians and the Federal Reserve, and they're losing, people are losing confidence in those entities constantly.
[00:26:44.265 --> 00:26:49.647]  But I think they tend to pull stuff out of the fire more than we ever dream.
[00:26:49.647 --> 00:26:54.948]  It doesn't deserve to exist, and they've really messed it up, and we have these tremendous deficits.
[00:26:54.948 --> 00:27:00.170]  I still think they could keep this thing going, you know, three, four, maybe even five years.
[00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:02.811]  But to say that, oh, okay, it's going to be safe.
[00:27:03.251 --> 00:27:14.976]  You see interest rates go up, why don't you go back into buying long-term bonds because, you know, in 10 or 15 years, there will be no problems and you can have confidence in what they're doing.
[00:27:14.976 --> 00:27:18.198]  I think it's way too early to expect that.
[00:27:18.198 --> 00:27:30.784]  Well, is it accurate to say this is a debt black hole and we're seeing this now in Ireland, not just in Greece, in Portugal and Spain, and that the bigger the bailouts, the more it just accelerates, you know, the final implosion?
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.622]  Yeah, and everything is based on the dollar.
[00:27:34.622 --> 00:27:40.767]  You know, we're in all this trouble, yet they can't bail out these countries or states like California.
[00:27:40.767 --> 00:27:48.313]  Everybody gets bailed out, but the base is the dollar, and the dollar is the reserve, and we're still getting away with it.
[00:27:48.313 --> 00:27:51.896]  We're still printing the money, and they're taking as much as China complains.
[00:27:51.896 --> 00:27:58.461]  They still, you know, buy some of our treasury debt less than they used to, but they have so much, and they don't want to crash it.
[00:27:59.281 --> 00:28:05.028]  But there's going to be a limit, and the markets are more powerful than the governments and the central banks.
[00:28:05.028 --> 00:28:16.140]  I keep thinking back, because I watched it so closely, in the 70s and in the 60s, because they kept pretending that the dollar was as good as gold, and it was $35 an ounce.
[00:28:17.361 --> 00:28:21.726]  But finally the market overwhelmed, no matter how many lies they told.
[00:28:21.726 --> 00:28:28.814]  People lost confidence in it and they had to quit the game because there wasn't people calling them on it and they wanted their gold.
[00:28:28.814 --> 00:28:29.915]  So the buck stops.
[00:28:29.915 --> 00:28:31.337]  Eventually that's going to happen again.
[00:28:31.337 --> 00:28:32.638]  So the buck stops.
[00:29:02.611 --> 00:29:04.352]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.

[00:31:03.808 --> 00:31:10.213]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:31:10.213 --> 00:31:17.599]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:31:17.599 --> 00:31:22.482]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[00:31:22.482 --> 00:31:24.624]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:31:27.426 --> 00:31:31.135]  Or see them online at FiveStarSoap.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:31:31.135 --> 00:31:34.864]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:31:35.396 --> 00:31:42.160]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:46.042]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:31:46.042 --> 00:31:54.127]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:31:54.127 --> 00:31:54.567]  Thank you.
[00:31:59.312 --> 00:32:03.855]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:03.855 --> 00:32:04.775]  Number 1.
[00:32:04.775 --> 00:32:08.198]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:08.198 --> 00:32:09.058]  Number 2.
[00:32:09.058 --> 00:32:13.941]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:13.941 --> 00:32:14.682]  It's true.
[00:32:14.682 --> 00:32:19.565]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:19.565 --> 00:32:20.385]  Number 3.
[00:32:20.385 --> 00:32:23.968]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:23.968 --> 00:32:27.670]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:28.670]  Number 4.
[00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:31.431]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:31.431 --> 00:32:35.113]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:35.113 --> 00:32:35.893]  Number 5.
[00:32:35.893 --> 00:32:40.055]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:40.055 --> 00:32:45.097]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:45.097 --> 00:32:49.278]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:49.278 --> 00:32:51.059]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:51.059 --> 00:32:55.661]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:32:55.981 --> 00:32:56.241]  877-327-0365.
[00:32:56.241 --> 00:33:03.006]  Coast to Coast.
[00:33:03.006 --> 00:33:05.047]  Direct from Austin.
[00:33:05.047 --> 00:33:08.269]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:20.362 --> 00:33:30.048]  Now racing through some of what's happening.
[00:33:30.048 --> 00:33:33.750]  We see the dollar back up today because of this Korea situation.
[00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:39.674]  Obviously, North Korea is a horrible, hereditary dictatorship under Kim Jong-il and now Kim Jong-un.
[00:33:40.434 --> 00:33:40.754]  I don't
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:58.062]  Killing and maiming quite a few people.
[00:33:58.062 --> 00:34:01.225]  The South Korean president says they're preparing to strike the North.
[00:34:01.225 --> 00:34:03.628]  The North is talking about annihilating the South.
[00:34:03.628 --> 00:34:05.870]  And then I have this Rand Corporation report.
[00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:09.073]  Rand lobbies Pentagon for start of war to save U.S.
[00:34:09.073 --> 00:34:09.894]  economy.
[00:34:09.894 --> 00:34:14.118]  I think back to NATO stirring stuff up with Russia on 888.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:17.761]  I have the Obama adviser telling the Financial Times of London
[00:34:18.562 --> 00:34:23.004]  Bottom line here is, Americans don't believe in President Obama's leadership.
[00:34:23.004 --> 00:34:30.188]  Robert Shapiro said he has to find some way between now and demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence.
[00:34:30.188 --> 00:34:33.930]  And short of a new 9-11 or Oklahoma City, I can't think of how he can do that.
[00:34:33.930 --> 00:34:36.131]  We also have neocon leaders telling Obama
[00:34:36.411 --> 00:34:38.833]  To attack Iran or start a war.
[00:34:38.833 --> 00:34:47.178]  So we see a lot of hype out there to start some type of war or stir one up to boost the dollar and keep this Ponzi scheme going.
[00:34:47.178 --> 00:34:49.900]  Your geopolitical take on that, Congressman?
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:35:02.748]  Yeah, it really is frightening when you hear people in our administration or outside the administration literally advocating war as a way to get out of an economic crisis, which is just insane talk.
[00:35:03.729 --> 00:35:15.019]  You know, the whole idea that we're on the verge of a serious attack by North Korea or South Korea or anybody else, they seem to be a little kooky for even implying that.
[00:35:15.019 --> 00:35:21.586]  But you wonder how they get motivated to do that, because, you know, it's worse than a third world nation.
[00:35:21.586 --> 00:35:23.768]  You know, they have weapons, that's all they have.
[00:35:23.968 --> 00:35:24.308]  I don't know.
[00:35:47.227 --> 00:35:49.668]  I mean, how many people died on our borders in the last year?
[00:35:49.668 --> 00:35:49.868]  Thousands!
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:25.570]  28,000 in the last two and a half years total and that's kind of out of sight out of mind but you have a better chance doctor as you know of dying from a bee sting than being killed by terrorists.
[00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:29.854]  Moving to the next subject, this radio show a month ago launched
[00:36:30.034 --> 00:36:30.154]  The
[00:36:49.264 --> 00:36:52.247]  Men touching babies' crotches.
[00:36:52.247 --> 00:37:01.875]  So this is now confirmed, and I believe this is a catalyst for the eruption of the anger that the American people already have.
[00:37:01.875 --> 00:37:03.856]  Doesn't this violate the Tenth Amendment?
[00:37:03.856 --> 00:37:07.940]  What are minimum wage federal employees doing groping everybody?
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.281]  I mean, how did we go this far?
[00:37:10.134 --> 00:37:12.195]  You know, it's hard to figure out.
[00:37:12.195 --> 00:37:14.116]  Who would have ever believed this?
[00:37:14.116 --> 00:37:23.221]  And the other day when I introduced my legislation to deal with this, I said, you know, I worry about the foreign policy, the spending, the Federal Reserve, our debt, the whole mess, which is huge.
[00:37:23.221 --> 00:37:26.443]  But this one, this one addresses something else.
[00:37:27.003 --> 00:37:30.004]  This one is just such an affront.
[00:37:30.004 --> 00:37:38.646]  So much out in the open in government being so bold as to maul us in public and say they're doing it for our interest.
[00:37:38.646 --> 00:37:41.727]  If we tolerate this, there's something wrong with us.
[00:37:41.727 --> 00:37:42.807]  I mean, something wrong with it.
[00:37:42.807 --> 00:37:47.468]  It's almost like it's probably not fair to say this because so many people don't deserve it.
[00:37:47.468 --> 00:37:49.709]  We deserve, you know, some of this stuff.
[00:37:49.709 --> 00:37:50.429]  If we don't do
[00:37:50.469 --> 00:37:55.375]  Do something about it and hopefully the American people will do something.
[00:37:55.375 --> 00:38:01.262]  They'll eventually have to boycott the airlines or whatever or throw more of the bums out.
[00:38:01.262 --> 00:38:07.470]  Maybe the Congress will get off their duff and do something in January and insist that we rein in the TSA.
[00:38:08.567 --> 00:38:20.334]  Congressman, a month ago, just with my own common sense, I said this new enhanced pat-down is meant to harass people into accepting the naked body scanners that turd off at others are openly making money out of.
[00:38:20.334 --> 00:38:23.495]  Now, Atlantic Monthly has talked to the TSA.
[00:38:23.495 --> 00:38:27.117]  They admitted that, yes, we want to intimidate people.
[00:38:27.117 --> 00:38:33.221]  So this is an act of harassment or sexual terrorism, in my view, and they admit it.
[00:38:33.221 --> 00:38:36.443]  Shouldn't there be congressional hearings about this?
[00:38:37.003 --> 00:38:52.491]  You know, the method to the madness, if government can set the precedent to put its hands down your pants or remove a urology or colostomy bag, and they are doing this, that's confirmed, or to strip down five-year-olds in full view.
[00:38:52.491 --> 00:38:53.832]  It reminds me of the Nazis.
[00:38:53.832 --> 00:38:56.474]  They started out with papers, please, in 33.
[00:38:56.474 --> 00:39:01.836]  By 40, it was stripping women down with babies and running them into pits and shooting them in the back of the head.
[00:39:01.836 --> 00:39:03.377]  We have the film footage of that.
[00:39:03.377 --> 00:39:04.138]  I mean, this is...
[00:39:04.978 --> 00:39:10.800]  Clearly, to dominate us and to break our will, but I think they've gone one step too far.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.861]  I think they've triggered the sleeping giant.
[00:39:12.861 --> 00:39:14.562]  Yeah, I hope so.
[00:39:14.562 --> 00:39:15.982]  It seems that way.
[00:39:15.982 --> 00:39:23.986]  Showing our papers, we've capitulated on that a long time because we show our social security number and our driver's license and the whole work.
[00:39:23.986 --> 00:39:27.527]  No matter what we do, get a job or buy something, they usually want those numbers.
[00:39:28.027 --> 00:39:37.694]  But now they want the government to show them our genitalia, and they want to take pictures of us and put their hands in our pants and all that.
[00:39:37.694 --> 00:39:42.518]  So that's hopefully enough to wake the people up.
[00:39:42.518 --> 00:39:48.423]  And what I think is great, you know, we complain a lot about the Main Street media, and they haven't been very friendly to us.
[00:39:48.423 --> 00:39:54.027]  But there's been a lot of good pictures on all the TV stations, you know, because it's been so abusive.
[00:39:56.128 --> 00:39:56.689]  I don't know.
[00:40:11.546 --> 00:40:14.688]  I think it's a healthy wake-up call to a lot of Americans.
[00:40:14.688 --> 00:40:20.172]  I just hope they can work that in to the whole concept of what's been going on with our country for a long time.
[00:40:20.172 --> 00:40:28.039]  Government is too big and intrusive and abuse our rights and they do the things they shouldn't be doing and they forget about the things they were instructed to do.
[00:40:28.599 --> 00:40:35.861]  Congressman, again, I noticed three weeks ago that this could be the catalyst for the American people to finally stand up and realize the power we have.
[00:40:35.861 --> 00:40:43.162]  Now mainstream media is admitting that this is something almost like the Tea Party that you were the catalyst for back in 07-08.
[00:40:43.162 --> 00:40:50.204]  I really see this trending towards a changing point on the graph going back towards liberty.
[00:40:50.204 --> 00:40:50.544]  Do you agree?
[00:40:51.104 --> 00:40:58.050]  Yeah, I think so, and they'll always be trying to minimize it and dilute it, so maybe they'll see this as an opportunity.
[00:40:58.050 --> 00:41:13.704]  They have to back off, and they might contract some of this work out, but if they contract it out to their favorite corporations, and they're doing the same thing, we have to be careful that they're not exempt, you know, from the same abuse that we're complaining about.
[00:41:13.704 --> 00:41:15.646]  That was my next question.
[00:41:15.646 --> 00:41:17.768]  Have you ever suffered at the hands of the TSA?
[00:41:18.408 --> 00:41:32.278]  I have to go through that all the time because I have metal in my knees and I don't go through, well, basically the x-ray is not available and I hate the idea of doing that, so I get prodded all the time.
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:49.864]  It is, it's so disgusting that I just don't understand, and that's why I'm determined to do my very best to wake up the people about what's happening.
[00:41:49.864 --> 00:41:51.724]  Well, doctor, we've only got about two minutes left.
[00:41:51.724 --> 00:41:56.766]  A medical doctor, ask permission, is trained, does it respectfully when you go get an exam.
[00:41:56.766 --> 00:42:07.750]  You're a gynecologist and delivered so many babies, but now some minimum wage person is pulling off urology bags, is sticking their hands in people's pants.
[00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:18.637]  Jesse Ventura, the former governor, said here last Friday that he's going to boycott it, and he believes if enough people don't fly, that will force industry to put pressure on government.
[00:42:18.637 --> 00:42:23.179]  I mean, specifically, have you had the enhanced pat-down yet, sir?
[00:42:23.179 --> 00:42:24.080]  Have they touched your crotch?
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:24.860]  Absolutely.
[00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:28.503]  It's like I said, absolutely disgusting.
[00:42:28.503 --> 00:42:30.424]  You know, they've already proven the point.
[00:42:30.424 --> 00:42:35.008]  You know, my argument is that the airlines, the owners of the airlines are responsible.
[00:42:35.008 --> 00:42:40.152]  It should be Continental and United, other people, and we should decide whether we want to contract with them.
[00:43:01.886 --> 00:43:05.910]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:09.153]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:43:09.153 --> 00:43:13.957]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:43:13.957 --> 00:43:20.343]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:43:20.343 --> 00:43:22.586]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:43:23.106 --> 00:43:23.426]  Tim Geithner?
[00:43:23.426 --> 00:43:23.907]  Bernanke?
[00:43:23.907 --> 00:43:24.267]  They're arsonists!
[00:43:24.267 --> 00:43:25.047]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:43:25.047 --> 00:43:26.688]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:43:42.017 --> 00:43:43.858]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:43:43.858 --> 00:43:49.301]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:43:49.301 --> 00:43:58.406]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:44:02.383 --> 00:44:06.344]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:44:06.344 --> 00:44:15.206]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:44:15.206 --> 00:44:19.827]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:44:19.827 --> 00:44:30.649]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:44:31.289 --> 00:44:40.792]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:44:40.792 --> 00:44:46.234]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:44:46.234 --> 00:44:53.717]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:44:53.717 --> 00:44:56.478]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:45:01.941 --> 00:45:04.462]  And you're subject to other police action.
[00:45:04.462 --> 00:45:05.722]  Tyranny is here.
[00:45:05.722 --> 00:45:09.344]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:45:09.344 --> 00:45:11.905]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:45:11.905 --> 00:45:17.767]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:45:17.767 --> 00:45:23.989]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:45:24.429 --> 00:45:30.372]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:45:30.372 --> 00:45:34.594]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:45:34.594 --> 00:45:38.877]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:45:38.877 --> 00:45:44.820]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:48.382]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:45:48.382 --> 00:45:50.343]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:45:50.343 --> 00:45:50.783]  It's here.

[00:46:02.202 --> 00:46:03.922]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:46:03.922 --> 00:46:09.644]  You've heard me talk about the delicious, easy-to-fix, and very storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:46:09.644 --> 00:46:14.405]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.
[00:46:14.405 --> 00:46:18.146]  Now it's that time of year again, and their holiday special is here.

[00:46:47.657 --> 00:46:50.038]  That's 800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:47:01.488 --> 00:47:05.073]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:47:05.073 --> 00:47:08.278]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:13.615 --> 00:47:20.377]  Joel Skousen is editor of World Affairs Brief, political scientist specializing in the philosophy of law and constitutional theory.
[00:47:20.377 --> 00:47:25.578]  He's also a designer of high-tech security residences and retreats for the elite and others.
[00:47:25.578 --> 00:47:31.719]  He has designed self-sufficient and high-security homes throughout North America and has consulted in Central America as well.
[00:47:31.719 --> 00:47:35.260]  He, of course, has the book Strategic Relocation, North American Guide to Safe Places.
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:39.762]  He's also a fighter pilot, a veteran, and a lot more.
[00:47:39.762 --> 00:47:56.891]  And his uncle was Cleon Skousen, who wrote the definitive works even before we had the works of the insiders admitting and confirming what Cleon Skousen said, like the author of Tragedy and Hope, of course, Bill Clinton's mentor, Carol Quigley.
[00:47:56.891 --> 00:47:58.512]  WorldAffairsBrief.com.
[00:47:58.512 --> 00:48:02.154]  I wanted to get him on because there have been so many new developments.
[00:48:02.154 --> 00:48:03.755]  Just to recap for those that joined us.
[00:48:04.555 --> 00:48:05.736]  Washington Times, U.S.
[00:48:05.736 --> 00:48:10.599]  sends carrier group to Yellow Sea for exercises near Korea.
[00:48:10.599 --> 00:48:12.680]  They're reportedly going to go into areas that are disputed.
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.301]  Again, a major provocation.
[00:48:14.301 --> 00:48:23.185]  I'm no fan of the lunatic, hermit, hereditary dictatorship controlled by China of North Korea, but this is a provocation.
[00:48:23.185 --> 00:48:31.970]  China may spurn Obama appeal to rein in North Korea after attack on the South, started by the earlier South Korean provocation going into the waters.
[00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:32.431]  We also
[00:48:33.251 --> 00:48:35.473]  Have one telegraphed North Korea attacks.
[00:48:35.473 --> 00:48:38.496]  Are we skipping towards a nuclear apocalypse?
[00:48:38.496 --> 00:48:39.697]  Very, very serious.
[00:48:39.697 --> 00:48:41.198]  The Infowars.com story.
[00:48:41.198 --> 00:48:47.223]  Pentagon to send aircraft carrier strike group into the areas right off the coast of North Korea.
[00:48:47.223 --> 00:48:54.370]  We also have the amazing China Daily, which is, you know, pretty much an authorized government front group for the Communist Chinese headline.
[00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:56.391]  China, Russia quit dollar.
[00:48:56.391 --> 00:48:59.813]  They signed the deal last night to start trading with each other.
[00:48:59.813 --> 00:49:05.356]  Natural gas and oil from Russia for raw materials and rare earth minerals and finished goods from China.
[00:49:05.356 --> 00:49:10.239]  This is a big deal and it's right down Joel Skousen's alley with his research.
[00:49:10.239 --> 00:49:12.880]  Joel, we've got about 22 minutes left with you.
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.481]  Appreciate you joining us.
[00:49:14.481 --> 00:49:17.083]  Break down what you think this signifies geopolitically.
[00:49:18.439 --> 00:49:20.100]  Thanks Alex, it's good to be with you.
[00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:22.361]  Let me give some perspective to this.
[00:49:22.361 --> 00:49:27.864]  Since the armistice, you know they're still technically at war, North Korea, South Korea.
[00:49:27.864 --> 00:49:35.308]  Since the armistice, there have been 150 acts of war on the part of the North Koreans versus the South Koreans or U.S.
[00:49:36.048 --> 00:49:37.169]  Just a brief rundown.
[00:49:37.169 --> 00:49:41.593]  Three assassination attempts on presidents of state.
[00:49:41.593 --> 00:49:43.074]  Dozens of kidnappings.
[00:49:43.074 --> 00:49:46.877]  Three American soldiers killed at the border zone.
[00:49:46.877 --> 00:49:50.500]  Five ships attacked, including the recent patrol boat attack.
[00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:52.101]  Three airliners hijacked.
[00:49:52.907 --> 00:49:53.888]  We're good to go.
[00:50:11.664 --> 00:50:13.525]  The Pueblo!
[00:50:13.525 --> 00:50:14.425]  And then there's the U.S.
[00:50:14.425 --> 00:50:16.366]  Pueblo, which is the last vote on my list.
[00:50:16.366 --> 00:50:17.287]  A major U.S.
[00:50:17.287 --> 00:50:21.428]  reconnaissance ship captured, never returned, crew imprisoned.
[00:50:21.428 --> 00:50:23.489]  These are acts of war and the U.S.
[00:50:23.489 --> 00:50:27.191]  has done nothing but pontificate.
[00:50:27.191 --> 00:50:38.236]  Now, I gave his background because I want to say that even though these appear to be huge provocations, it is my analysis they will not amount to anything.
[00:50:39.085 --> 00:50:49.611]  In fact, I think that Lindsey Williams' source has been throwing out disinformation ever since the oil prediction, which was correct.
[00:50:49.611 --> 00:50:54.734]  They often do that, start with something correct, and then start to do things which haven't happened or won't happen.
[00:50:54.734 --> 00:51:01.358]  Now, I'm not downplaying the fact that China is the big problem, and North Korea is its lackey.
[00:51:02.441 --> 00:51:12.828]  But I believe very strongly, strategically, that North Korea is being saved as a trigger event for World War III, something very big and much further down the line.
[00:51:12.828 --> 00:51:18.351]  In other words, this is, Iran is not a, how should I say, a diversion.
[00:51:18.351 --> 00:51:24.415]  Iran is the next country to be attacked, and you will mark my words, Alex, this will pass
[00:51:25.325 --> 00:51:31.007]  In so many words, and they will continue to placate North Korea for these egregious acts of war.
[00:51:31.007 --> 00:51:32.548]  Do nothing to them.
[00:51:32.548 --> 00:51:33.968]  No regime change.
[00:51:33.968 --> 00:51:34.808]  No attacks.
[00:51:34.808 --> 00:51:36.509]  No retaliation.
[00:51:36.509 --> 00:51:38.850]  And North Korea will not, in fact, attack the U.S.
[00:51:38.850 --> 00:51:40.150]  fleet out there.
[00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:44.772]  But we will see a continual attack in the Middle East, and Iran will be targeted sometimes.
[00:51:45.692 --> 00:52:07.201]  To correct myself, because as I said it, I realized that it wasn't the full spectrum of what William's source, who he's now revealed, had told him, who clearly is an insider, that now Iran is on the map, but after that, to watch China and Russia, because they were the big players.
[00:52:07.201 --> 00:52:09.082]  Do you agree with what William's source said?
[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:15.465]  Yes, absolutely, as long as he's not saying that this is the immediate source, because it is not.
[00:52:15.465 --> 00:52:25.553]  That's what I'm trying to say, is that there's a pattern of permissiveness with North Korea that is just unexplainable vis-a-vis the way that we treat Iran.
[00:52:25.553 --> 00:52:26.954]  If Iran, I mean, the U.S.
[00:52:26.954 --> 00:52:28.416]  has been begging Iran to do anything.
[00:52:28.936 --> 00:52:38.619]  Any one of these things, try an assassination attempt in Iraq, kidnap someone, have an artillery attack on Iraq, or a missile attack, or shoot down a U.S.
[00:52:38.619 --> 00:52:39.719]  aircraft, can you imagine?
[00:52:39.719 --> 00:52:44.621]  We would be at war attacking Iran within 30 minutes if they did this.
[00:52:45.345 --> 00:52:51.026]  This would be God's gift to Obama, to George Bush, to give them an excuse to attack.
[00:52:51.026 --> 00:52:53.887]  And that just shows the hypocrisy.
[00:52:53.887 --> 00:53:04.749]  Iran is nowhere near the danger that North Korea is to the world with its weapons programs, with its proliferation of weapons, nuclear proliferation, its missile program.
[00:53:04.749 --> 00:53:05.909]  And yet we do nothing.
[00:53:05.909 --> 00:53:08.309]  In fact, we guarantee that no regime change.
[00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:10.370]  We guarantee no military interference.
[00:53:12.458 --> 00:53:20.044]  What was the 1988 event at the end of the Iran-Iraq war where, I've seen it reported, it's the biggest U.S.
[00:53:20.044 --> 00:53:28.371]  naval engagement since the end of World War II is how they bill it, where they destroyed a bunch of Iranian battleship.
[00:53:28.371 --> 00:53:30.573]  They called it Operation Praying Mantis.
[00:53:33.024 --> 00:53:36.925]  Yes, and it was very, very serious.
[00:53:36.925 --> 00:53:40.366]  At that time, of course, they didn't have the war on terror going on.
[00:53:40.366 --> 00:53:46.127]  They didn't have the provocations to be able to mount an attack on Iran, in fact.
[00:53:46.127 --> 00:53:52.769]  And so it was not anything related to the current war or current plans on attacking Iran.
[00:53:52.769 --> 00:54:00.591]  You know, we had the major shoot-down of one of the Iranian airliners at one time, too, which probably was, in fact, a mistake.
[00:54:02.791 --> 00:54:09.438]  You know, Iran, it certainly helped to inspire a great deal of hatred towards America.
[00:54:09.438 --> 00:54:17.047]  And I think that's what, in essence, the Iranian attack will become, is sealing the nail on the coffin of the U.S.
[00:54:17.047 --> 00:54:18.168]  as the bully of the world.
[00:54:18.168 --> 00:54:20.110]  We're going to look very, very bad.
[00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:24.595]  Israel's going to look very, very bad at attacking Iran and destroying a lot of infrastructure there.
[00:54:25.433 --> 00:54:29.997]  But I think we have to be very careful to take this in perspective, what's happening in North Korea.
[00:54:29.997 --> 00:54:33.159]  I mean, look at the wordage of the United States.
[00:54:33.159 --> 00:54:39.625]  You know, we are outraged, they say, and yet we must insist on a measured, unified response to the North Korean attack.
[00:54:39.625 --> 00:54:40.245]  And what do they do?
[00:54:40.245 --> 00:54:43.768]  They go to the Chinese and say, we want you to rein in your little puppet country.
[00:54:44.770 --> 00:54:45.690]  China does nothing.
[00:54:45.690 --> 00:54:48.311]  They never will do anything about China.
[00:54:48.311 --> 00:54:48.691]  The U.S.
[00:54:48.691 --> 00:54:51.873]  will never do anything about China's refusal to do that.
[00:54:51.873 --> 00:54:54.313]  Let me ask you this, Joel.
[00:54:54.313 --> 00:55:12.660]  Back in the mid-1990s, Bill Clinton gets the blame, and he deserves a large portion of it, for allowing Laura Allen Hughes to transfer the ICBM systems, the MERV reentry blueprints, but also the head of ABB, the Swiss company,
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:20.943]  Headed up by Rumsfeld, Donald Rumsfeld, transferring the reactor systems to them as well.
[00:55:20.943 --> 00:55:27.726]  So clearly, why did the West allow AQ Khan Laboratories to develop nuclear weapons?
[00:55:27.726 --> 00:55:37.131]  Why did England, the United States, and Israel, to some extent, help give nukes to Pakistan, help give nukes to North Korea, but then freak out over Iran?
[00:55:39.022 --> 00:55:44.044]  Well, as I say, this is our terrorists versus the ones that are in our control.
[00:55:44.044 --> 00:55:50.727]  The ones that we want to use for provocations of World War III, I think, is a very long-term process involved in this.
[00:55:50.727 --> 00:55:54.748]  I mean, we know, for example, that part of the con-nuclear
[00:55:57.432 --> 00:56:03.274]  The spying ring was instrumental in giving Iran their start in their nuclear program.
[00:56:03.274 --> 00:56:10.837]  And they in fact gave them, according to the CIA, and this may be disinformation, flawed plans that wouldn't work, in fact.
[00:56:10.837 --> 00:56:11.377]  But the U.S.
[00:56:11.377 --> 00:56:17.679]  has very much to do with getting Iranian programs started in nuclear war, of course, with Pakistan as well.
[00:56:17.679 --> 00:56:22.461]  I think we're looking at some very sophisticated levels of conflict creation here.
[00:56:22.461 --> 00:56:24.342]  The entire Pakistani
[00:56:25.998 --> 00:56:27.039]  I think so.
[00:56:41.192 --> 00:56:50.542]  India was a client state of Russia for many years, and now it's starting to, the West is trying to woo India away from Russia's field of influence.
[00:56:50.542 --> 00:56:54.226]  Pakistan for years was a client state of China, and the U.S.
[00:56:54.226 --> 00:56:58.551]  successfully wooed China away specifically over the nuclear program.
[00:56:59.071 --> 00:57:03.094]  China was not giving nuclear weapons to Pakistan, and the U.S.
[00:57:03.094 --> 00:57:05.316]  came in through a kickoff and did it.
[00:57:05.316 --> 00:57:13.041]  And that's what got all of the Pakistani elite in the ISI and the controllers in the military tied to the U.S.
[00:57:13.041 --> 00:57:14.843]  They've been tied there ever since.
[00:57:14.843 --> 00:57:23.429]  There's still a T-to-T going on between China trying to woo back Pakistan, but I'm not sure exactly how this is going to play out.
[00:57:24.089 --> 00:57:33.875]  In the World War, I know that when it's finally launched, China's very, very worried about India being in its backyard.
[00:57:33.875 --> 00:57:40.399]  I mean, India's got as many potential soldiers as China does and probably capable of better training.
[00:57:40.399 --> 00:57:44.101]  So if that turns on China at some point, they could be in trouble.
[00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:55.223]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:57:55.223 --> 00:57:56.123]  Number 1.
[00:57:56.123 --> 00:57:59.546]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:57:59.546 --> 00:58:00.406]  Number 2.
[00:58:00.406 --> 00:58:05.309]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:58:05.309 --> 00:58:06.050]  It's true.
[00:58:06.050 --> 00:58:10.933]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:58:10.933 --> 00:58:11.753]  Number 3.
[00:58:11.753 --> 00:58:15.336]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:58:15.336 --> 00:58:19.018]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:58:19.238 --> 00:58:20.039]  Number 4.
[00:58:20.039 --> 00:58:22.801]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:58:22.801 --> 00:58:26.484]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:58:26.484 --> 00:58:27.264]  Number 5.
[00:58:27.264 --> 00:58:31.407]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:58:31.407 --> 00:58:36.171]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:18.189]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.189 --> 01:00:22.293]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.543 --> 01:00:33.225]  We've got a surprise congressman popping in in about 30 minutes.
[01:00:33.225 --> 01:00:37.529]  He's very upset about the airline chicanery and the slave trading going on.
[01:00:37.529 --> 01:00:39.130]  That's backfiring on the system.
[01:00:39.130 --> 01:00:46.156]  We're gonna open the phones up in the next two segments for your view on North Korea, the TSA, the opt-out day.
[01:00:46.156 --> 01:00:46.956]  I'm just not flying.
[01:00:47.917 --> 01:00:52.602]  All this going on.
[01:00:52.602 --> 01:00:53.182]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:53.182 --> 01:00:53.302]  800-259-9231.
[01:00:53.302 --> 01:01:00.289]  We got about four minutes left with Joel Skousen of World Affairs Brief if you just joined us.
[01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:06.654]  He was getting into his global strategic worldview from studying the globalists that I think is very accurate from my
[01:01:08.737 --> 01:01:10.299]  I concur with much of what he's saying.
[01:01:10.299 --> 01:01:13.543]  I think that's the general direction that the global power blocks are moving.
[01:01:25.876 --> 01:01:29.001]  Okay, before I get into that, I just want to make a clarification.
[01:01:29.001 --> 01:01:31.324]  When I said, uh, when do I think they're going to attack Iran?
[01:01:31.324 --> 01:01:33.047]  When I said this year, I didn't mean 2010.
[01:01:33.047 --> 01:01:34.809]  I mean in the next 12 months.
[01:01:34.809 --> 01:01:35.050]  Yes.
[01:01:35.050 --> 01:01:37.032]  Because this year is almost through.
[01:01:39.028 --> 01:01:46.294]  Going back to this general scenario, remember that Russia is running this show.
[01:01:46.294 --> 01:01:52.359]  China is going to be tagging along as the ally to back up Russia in its nuclear attack on the West.
[01:01:52.359 --> 01:01:58.945]  China wants to play the role as not the primary attacker because it wants to position itself to be the Cold War
[01:01:59.915 --> 01:02:04.199]  Opposer of the West after it becomes the ally of the West during the war.
[01:02:04.199 --> 01:02:05.240]  It's like Russia.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:13.006]  Russia comes in and helps the West beat Germany and then becomes the new Cold War enemy and gets all these concessions from the United States in the process.
[01:02:13.006 --> 01:02:14.747]  That's what China is setting itself up to.
[01:02:14.747 --> 01:02:20.192]  So China will be careful not to appear to be too much of the enemy even though they will
[01:02:21.266 --> 01:02:35.361]  Take I think when this war starts the Pacific in order to guard the rear of Russia and then from that position they'll attack Russia sometime during the war so that the West can win the war against Russia.
[01:02:35.361 --> 01:02:37.383]  Then it will be the West versus China.
[01:02:37.383 --> 01:02:38.844]  That's the big picture.
[01:02:38.844 --> 01:02:41.287]  Now in doing so I don't think that China will
[01:02:41.787 --> 01:02:42.027]  I think?
[01:02:58.883 --> 01:03:03.847]  We have to watch Russia because Russia is the one that's calling the shots here.
[01:03:03.847 --> 01:03:08.370]  Right now, the West is in the middle of giving everything away to the Russians.
[01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:20.519]  In NATO, for example, doing a joint military missile defense with Russia, Russia says, we'll cover your East, and you take up the missile defense in Western Europe itself.
[01:03:20.519 --> 01:03:25.923]  What they're doing, and this is very, very interesting, they're saying, we'll put our own missile defenses in here,
[01:03:26.767 --> 01:03:30.729]  To guard against Islamic, you know, rogue missile attacks.
[01:03:30.729 --> 01:03:43.554]  But they're taking the prime position to be able to use anti-ballistic missiles to keep Western anti-ballistic missiles from shooting down their own missiles in their boost phase by taking the Near East position.
[01:03:44.451 --> 01:03:47.532]  I don't know if I'm being clear what I'm saying correctly here.
[01:03:47.532 --> 01:03:58.034]  But it's very, very important for the West to understand that the French, who are now driving the agenda in NATO, are completely selling out to the Russians.
[01:03:58.034 --> 01:04:00.834]  Why, just for natural gas?
[01:04:00.834 --> 01:04:03.735]  No, no, it seems to be part of the globalist agenda.
[01:04:03.735 --> 01:04:10.596]  The natural gas is being driven by the... Well, the EU has been called by Lord Monk and many others properly the new Soviet.
[01:04:11.613 --> 01:04:12.154]  That's right.
[01:04:12.154 --> 01:04:17.562]  It is a new Soviet and they're basically, it's really a control of who's going to run this new world war.
[01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:18.964]  The Russians want to run it.
[01:04:18.964 --> 01:04:23.511]  The Anglo-American establishment know that they intend to run it and they have to eliminate Russia in the process.
[01:04:23.511 --> 01:04:25.995]  But they're in the process of luring Russia in.
[01:04:26.901 --> 01:04:30.222]  And getting it to be confident enough to attack the West.
[01:04:30.222 --> 01:04:34.063]  That's been the West's problem all these years, is trying to get Russia over.
[01:04:34.063 --> 01:04:39.164]  That's why the disarmament, that's why taking out our MX missile, even when they reneged on theirs.
[01:04:39.164 --> 01:04:40.704]  You know, Joel, this is too important.
[01:04:40.704 --> 01:04:50.906]  I promise to go to calls, but can you come back on the other side of the quick break for three minutes, put bookends on this and explain in basics the factions you see, how you see it playing out.
[01:04:50.906 --> 01:04:52.067]  This is so important.
[01:04:52.067 --> 01:04:53.307]  Can you come back for three more minutes?
[01:04:53.587 --> 01:04:54.247]  Yeah, I will do that.
[01:04:54.247 --> 01:04:54.847]  Okay, we will.
[01:04:54.847 --> 01:05:01.090]  And I promise folks, 800-259-9231, we're going right to your calls.
[01:05:01.090 --> 01:05:02.850]  Home Gain before.

[01:06:07.957 --> 01:06:12.359]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:12.359 --> 01:06:17.981]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:19.762 --> 01:06:39.895]  Well, I tell ya, I've always been a supporter and a fan of Representative who's on with us right now, but I had no idea that there in Knoxville, Tennessee, he is a listener to the show, Representative John Duncan, and of course he's made headlines across the country in the last few weeks.
[01:06:40.515 --> 01:06:43.876]  Criticizing the TSA and their activities.
[01:06:43.876 --> 01:06:56.421]  Here's the headline, Duncan blasts TSA pat-downs body scans in floor speech and then I was just talking to him during the break and he heard Ron Paul and Judge Andrew Napolitano on the show yesterday so he'll be with us for about 25
[01:06:57.401 --> 01:07:00.422]  minutes but hopefully the first of many visits.
[01:07:00.422 --> 01:07:09.024]  So we'll give a shout out to WBCR 1470 that we've been on for about a decade there in the Knoxville area.
[01:07:09.024 --> 01:07:16.386]  And I would also add on the New American Magazine True Patriot Index, he has the second highest in the country.
[01:07:16.386 --> 01:07:18.226]  He has a 99 score.
[01:07:18.226 --> 01:07:19.066]  Ron Paul has a 100.
[01:07:19.066 --> 01:07:24.548]  So we're very very excited to have Representative Congressman John Duncan on with us.
[01:07:24.548 --> 01:07:25.568]  Congressman, great to have you.
[01:07:26.129 --> 01:07:27.790]  Well, Alex, thank you very much.
[01:07:27.790 --> 01:07:36.875]  It's a real honor to be on with you, and I always have appreciated the work you've done in trying to fight against the New World Order and big government.
[01:07:38.729 --> 01:07:50.115]  Big government helps only the elitist and the very, very wealthy, and you fight for the people that I... Well, I hate to say the little guy, but you know what I mean.
[01:07:50.115 --> 01:07:52.976]  I appreciate the work that you do.
[01:07:52.976 --> 01:07:53.917]  Well, we appreciate you.
[01:07:53.917 --> 01:07:56.999]  How long have you been tuning in to the show on WBCR?
[01:07:56.999 --> 01:08:00.300]  Oh, for many years.
[01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:02.361]  I know Harry Grothjohn real well.
[01:08:02.361 --> 01:08:05.083]  I've been on with him many times, and I've been on with
[01:08:06.098 --> 01:08:07.159]  He has the power, Aaron.
[01:08:07.159 --> 01:08:12.504]  I've been on with Joyce Riley a couple of times, and I've listened to your show.
[01:08:12.504 --> 01:08:25.175]  I try never to miss a vote, but as soon as we have the last vote of the week, I catch the first plane home, and I actually end up spending just a little bit more time here in my district in Tennessee than
[01:08:26.056 --> 01:08:31.540]  I do in Washington, and so I do listen to several of the other stations.
[01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:43.429]  I don't want to make any of my other friends mad on the other stations, but I listen to WPCR regularly, and I really have enjoyed your program for many years, probably ever since you've been on here.
[01:08:43.868 --> 01:08:44.869]  Well, God bless you, sir.
[01:08:44.869 --> 01:08:46.070]  Small world.
[01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:58.198]  This TSA situation is really becoming a focal point, not just against the abuse and humiliation, but overall a focal point for people's anger.
[01:08:58.198 --> 01:09:00.300]  Give us your view on that statement.
[01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:03.081]  And the fact that every day we learn more.
[01:09:03.081 --> 01:09:05.462]  Now they stick the hands in the pants.
[01:09:05.462 --> 01:09:13.785]  Now they're removing people's urology bags, colostomy bags, women's artificial breasts from mastectomies.
[01:09:13.785 --> 01:09:17.547]  I mean, this is a federal power grab on so many fronts, Congressman.
[01:09:18.467 --> 01:09:21.049]  Tell us why you have powerfully spoken out against it.
[01:09:21.049 --> 01:09:23.612]  I mean, I know that you're on some of the most important committees.
[01:09:23.612 --> 01:09:28.976]  You were previously the House Aviation Subcommittee and top Republican on the House Subcommittee.
[01:09:28.976 --> 01:09:30.718]  You'll probably be getting back in as the chairman.
[01:09:30.718 --> 01:09:33.060]  I mean, you're a leading expert in this area.
[01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:33.821]  Give us your view on it.
[01:09:34.881 --> 01:09:47.709]  Well, I did chair the Aviation Subcommittee for six years a few years ago when Republicans had control of the Congress, and we have a rule on our side that you can only chair a committee or subcommittee for six years.
[01:09:47.709 --> 01:09:52.612]  But I have been on the Aviation Subcommittee ever since I've been in Congress, and that's
[01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:58.672]  Now 22 years, and so it's something I'm very much interested in.
[01:09:58.672 --> 01:10:03.654]  I will continue to serve on that subcommittee, although I won't be chairman.
[01:10:03.654 --> 01:10:08.136]  I'll be chairman in the next Congress of the Highways and Transit Subcommittee.
[01:10:08.136 --> 01:10:15.778]  But I think this body scanner business and these pat-downs, I think it's totally ridiculous.
[01:10:15.778 --> 01:10:16.939]  I think it's excessive.
[01:10:18.251 --> 01:10:28.798]  And I've tried to tell people that if we spend 100% of the federal budget on security, we could not make the country totally, completely, 100% safe.
[01:10:28.798 --> 01:10:31.780]  So we need to have a little balance and common sense.
[01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:34.822]  And I think that we need to come to our senses on this.
[01:10:34.822 --> 01:10:38.204]  I think it's far more about money than it is about security.
[01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:54.367]  Although I do realize that even though there's a nationwide revolt against this and people are really upset about it, as they should be, I do realize that there probably are half the people who will go along with anything as long as it has the word security attached to it.
[01:10:54.367 --> 01:11:01.431]  But I think the TSA has gone too far and I've spoken out on the floor about this.
[01:11:02.635 --> 01:11:09.879]  And of course another thing I've been concerned about, almost all these federal contracts are sweetheart insider type deals.
[01:11:09.879 --> 01:11:11.280]  And I don't like that either.
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:13.961]  I think that's present here too.
[01:11:13.961 --> 01:11:24.607]  Well Chertoff, as you spoke on the floor, Benjamin Chertoff, former head of Homeland Security, and Alphonse D'Amato, and there's also some Democrats involved, but the former Senator, he's been all over TV.
[01:11:24.607 --> 01:11:26.548]  We've played the clips admitting he's making money.
[01:11:27.248 --> 01:11:27.688]  I don't know.
[01:11:51.420 --> 01:12:06.938]  Well you've hit on something else that I've been very outspoken about on the floor and that is that the defense contractors hire all the retired admirals and generals and then they go back and sign on with these big defense contractors and go back and get the
[01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:12.400]  Just ridiculously expensive contracts for the Pentagon.
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:18.964]  In fact, I've said in speeches and in committee hearings that I wonder sometimes if there's any conservatives at the Pentagon.
[01:12:18.964 --> 01:12:25.909]  And I can say that even though I believe that national defense is probably the most legitimate function.
[01:12:26.761 --> 01:12:36.126]  Of the federal government, but I still hate to see all the waste and insider dealing that's going on with the Defense Department.
[01:12:36.126 --> 01:12:49.194]  But going back to Turtoff, there's something funny going on there, in my opinion, because a year ago, November of last year, he was on the Campbell Brown Show on CNN.
[01:12:49.194 --> 01:12:53.096]  And he was talking, you know, he was supporting these scanners at that time.
[01:12:53.892 --> 01:13:04.600]  And he didn't mention that he had anything to do with any of the companies until Campbell Brown said, well, in the interest of full disclosure, you represent some of these companies.
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:11.065]  And having been caught, then he said, absolutely, that's correct.
[01:13:11.065 --> 01:13:14.128]  In other words, he admitted after she confronted him with it.
[01:13:14.128 --> 01:13:22.254]  And so then there was a story in the Washington Post at the first of this year saying that he had this
[01:13:22.819 --> 01:13:23.679]  We're good to go.
[01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:49.050]  It still looks like an insider type deal to me.
[01:13:56.892 --> 01:13:58.552]  Look, the borders are wide open.
[01:13:58.552 --> 01:14:08.154]  ABC News reported two weeks ago that illegal aliens can walk in and get a TSA waiver and have and get to rent aircraft.
[01:14:08.154 --> 01:14:13.215]  We know that hundreds of boats a week are landing in San Diego and on the island off the coast.
[01:14:13.215 --> 01:14:15.015]  That's Associated Press.
[01:14:15.015 --> 01:14:18.376]  And that the illegal aliens are just pouring in on the fishing boats.
[01:14:18.376 --> 01:14:19.976]  No police, no border patrol.
[01:14:19.976 --> 01:14:22.516]  They could care less.
[01:14:22.516 --> 01:14:24.177]  You're exactly right.
[01:14:24.177 --> 01:14:25.977]  And what I said on that
[01:14:27.323 --> 01:14:32.739]  We've got plenty of security at the airports right now, but there's always companies and people trying to...
[01:14:33.371 --> 01:14:35.652]  Get more and get you to spend more.
[01:14:35.652 --> 01:14:42.313]  But I think now these terrorists would probably do something much more spectacular than bringing down a plane.
[01:14:42.313 --> 01:14:52.816]  They'd probably blow up a mall at Christmas or blow up a major sporting event or poison a water supply or even blow up a big city subway system.
[01:14:52.816 --> 01:14:54.937]  They'd kill a lot more people.
[01:14:54.937 --> 01:14:58.538]  And I think, too, we're very vulnerable in cybersecurity.
[01:15:00.035 --> 01:15:03.196]  We're so controlled by all the computers and so forth now.
[01:15:03.196 --> 01:15:09.599]  So, you know, we just can't do, we can't go ridiculously overboard at the airport.
[01:15:09.599 --> 01:15:10.839]  That's what I'm trying to say.
[01:15:10.839 --> 01:15:18.162]  I mean, are we going to have minimum wage federal employees that are outside the law and violate due process?
[01:15:18.162 --> 01:15:24.465]  I mean, actually, Big Sis Janet Napolitano is actually in the news.
[01:15:25.541 --> 01:15:32.664]  Now saying, next they want them in malls, trains, boats, buses.
[01:15:32.664 --> 01:15:37.206]  We already have TSA doing warrantless searches in areas like New York and Boston.
[01:15:37.206 --> 01:15:42.388]  I mean, are we going to have 50 million TSA workers to guard every 7-Eleven?
[01:15:42.388 --> 01:15:45.269]  Because, I mean, a real terrorist, I mean, that's just the way it is.
[01:15:45.269 --> 01:15:49.991]  The only answer is to have an armed, concealed carry population.
[01:15:49.991 --> 01:15:52.632]  You can't put enough police on the streets with machine guns and dogs.
[01:16:03.015 --> 01:16:04.655]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:16:04.655 --> 01:16:10.376]  You've heard me talk about the delicious, easy-to-fix, and very storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:16:10.376 --> 01:16:15.117]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.
[01:16:15.117 --> 01:16:18.878]  Now it's that time of year again, and their holiday special is here.

[01:17:00.615 --> 01:17:04.436]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:17:04.436 --> 01:17:08.717]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:17:08.717 --> 01:17:13.418]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:17:13.418 --> 01:17:19.360]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:22.601]  Not worried about them moving south.
[01:17:22.601 --> 01:17:26.402]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:17:29.136 --> 01:17:34.680]  I'm looking for America.
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:36.321]  We're American and be proud.
[01:17:36.321 --> 01:17:39.083]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:17:39.083 --> 01:17:43.546]  Land I left free in the home of the brave.
[01:17:43.546 --> 01:17:47.309]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[01:17:55.109 --> 01:18:00.275]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:18:00.275 --> 01:18:04.839]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:18:04.839 --> 01:18:09.184]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:18:09.184 --> 01:18:14.570]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:15.651]  It's true.
[01:18:15.651 --> 01:18:21.356]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:18:21.356 --> 01:18:24.939]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:18:24.939 --> 01:18:29.663]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:18:29.663 --> 01:18:32.426]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:18:32.426 --> 01:18:35.749]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:18:36.069 --> 01:18:41.012]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:18:41.012 --> 01:18:46.074]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:18:46.074 --> 01:18:50.256]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:18:50.256 --> 01:18:52.037]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:18:52.037 --> 01:18:56.639]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:19:01.018 --> 01:19:16.488]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:19:16.488 --> 01:19:20.171]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:19:21.198 --> 01:19:33.950]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:41.216]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:19:41.897 --> 01:19:52.279]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:19:52.279 --> 01:19:56.200]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:20:01.741]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:20:01.741 --> 01:20:08.542]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:11.567 --> 01:20:22.110]  Well, if this continues, we'll have to change the American flag to basically an image of a sheep or an ostrich with its head in the sand.
[01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:25.991]  And we'll have to get rid of the American eagle and replace it with an ostrich.
[01:20:25.991 --> 01:20:29.753]  I mean, since when did the land of the free, home of the brave get like this?
[01:20:29.753 --> 01:20:36.555]  Where we're so afraid of men in caves, we've got a better chance from dying from a bee sting or an automobile accident.
[01:20:36.555 --> 01:20:38.675]  Hundreds die a year from bees and wasp stings.
[01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:45.419]  I mean, it's just so crazy to see the federal government expanding its power.
[01:20:45.419 --> 01:20:46.359]  But you're a congressman.
[01:20:46.359 --> 01:20:47.920]  You've studied these issues more than I have.
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:54.324]  I know that the airlines opt in to have the TSA there.
[01:20:54.324 --> 01:20:57.726]  Some airlines are saying and some airports are saying they don't want them now.
[01:21:00.828 --> 01:21:10.670]  I mean, at the end of the day, where do you see this backlash going and what are your biggest problems, Congressman, with what the TSA is doing?
[01:21:10.670 --> 01:21:18.812]  And isn't this a Tenth Amendment violation to have them on the streets of America and announcing that they want to expand what they're doing?
[01:21:18.812 --> 01:21:26.313]  Well, we have expanded all of these federal law enforcement agencies far beyond what they should be, far beyond what is necessary.
[01:21:26.313 --> 01:21:29.834]  I mean, the FBI, I mean, I have a...
[01:21:30.631 --> 01:21:32.717]  Knockle, whom I love very much, who...
[01:21:34.108 --> 01:21:40.309]  Many, many years ago started his career as an FBI agent, and he was just with them for a few years.
[01:21:40.309 --> 01:21:55.012]  But I'll tell you, we've expanded that agency far beyond what's necessary, and most of the real law enforcement work is done by local law enforcement people in the first place.
[01:21:55.012 --> 01:22:01.493]  And I've even said, for instance, that one agency that we should do away with is the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
[01:22:02.353 --> 01:22:12.417]  Now they've added on the word explosives to it to try to expand their mission, but everything that they do is done best by state and local law enforcement.
[01:22:12.417 --> 01:22:21.881]  People and one expert told me that they're nothing but paper pushers now, but I heard you say yesterday that bee sting analogy and I was very impressed by that.
[01:22:21.881 --> 01:22:27.504]  I have told people that you really are thousands of times, many thousands of times more likely
[01:22:28.959 --> 01:22:33.732]  Uh, uh, to be, uh, killed on the, uh, driving on the highway.
[01:22:33.732 --> 01:22:33.932]  Yes.
[01:22:33.932 --> 01:22:36.599]  Uh, uh, then, then, uh, you are a bad terrorist.
[01:22:38.350 --> 01:22:41.172]  The problem we're into is this, Alex.
[01:22:41.172 --> 01:22:50.118]  It's almost impossible to get big brother federal government to ever admit making a mistake or ever go back on anything.
[01:22:50.118 --> 01:22:56.022]  And we've given so much power in this country to unelected bureaucrats.
[01:22:56.022 --> 01:23:04.488]  In fact, I've said many times that today, unfortunately, we have a government up by and for the bureaucrats instead of up by and for the people.
[01:23:04.488 --> 01:23:06.790]  And so it's going to be very hard to get them to
[01:23:07.971 --> 01:23:09.233]  I don't know.
[01:23:28.284 --> 01:23:31.587]  Uh, and getting full body, uh, doses.
[01:23:31.587 --> 01:23:40.675]  Uh, the TSA is trying to say, oh, well, it's not, not a, it's just a tiny little dose, but I'll tell you, uh, they give you more protection at the dentist.
[01:23:40.675 --> 01:23:46.580]  Uh, when I go to the dentist, they put a, uh, a little shield over, uh, my neck and chest and so forth.
[01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:49.643]  Uh, and, uh, this is a full body.
[01:23:50.543 --> 01:23:51.544]  I think it's terrible.
[01:24:06.718 --> 01:24:21.311]  Well, I agree with you, Congressman, and I've had radiologists on the show, we've got the New York Times, top scientists, federal bodies, the International Atomic Energy Agency, have said that these things have 50 times what the TSA claimed a year ago.
[01:24:21.311 --> 01:24:24.474]  They've been lying, and if you look at the images TSA has released,
[01:24:24.994 --> 01:24:51.170]  To give you an idea, you can see the hands, and you can see the bones in the hands, and that's exactly what radiologists have told me on and off air, is that they've looked at the calibrations, it's about like a dental skull x-ray, it's not approaching a chest x-ray, but it's close, and it's the repeated exposure, and they've got all these top scientists on record saying bare minimum,
[01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:56.774]  Skin cancers, and that it'll exacerbate people that are already prone to skin cancers.
[01:24:56.774 --> 01:24:59.596]  What about the TSA workers who are around it all day?
[01:24:59.596 --> 01:25:03.058]  They're not hiding behind any lead shielding.
[01:25:03.058 --> 01:25:04.940]  But, Congressman, what about this issue?
[01:25:06.054 --> 01:25:08.856]  Ron Paul, we had him on yesterday, and you said you heard it.
[01:25:08.856 --> 01:25:09.336]  Right.
[01:25:09.336 --> 01:25:11.357]  But I said, so you've had Enhanced Pat down.
[01:25:11.357 --> 01:25:12.198]  He said, yes.
[01:25:12.198 --> 01:25:13.298]  I said, they've touched your crotch.
[01:25:13.298 --> 01:25:14.799]  He said, yes, it's disgusting.
[01:25:14.799 --> 01:25:19.642]  That's on the Drudge Report today, the video and audio of that.
[01:25:19.642 --> 01:25:23.924]  But now the TSA told ABC News, maybe that goes too far.
[01:25:23.924 --> 01:25:25.665]  Hand in the pants.
[01:25:25.665 --> 01:25:28.327]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:25:28.327 --> 01:25:31.829]  And now people are stripping down into their underwear as a protest.
[01:25:32.529 --> 01:25:41.616]  The TSA is still rubbing their skin, rubbing their kneecaps where they have metal in them to make sure it's really metal.
[01:25:41.616 --> 01:25:46.721]  I mean, this is like sacrificing our liberty on the altar.
[01:25:48.030 --> 01:25:48.190]  I don't
[01:26:11.633 --> 01:26:25.456]  Well, no, I don't get to bypass it, and I saw that in the paper myself.
[01:26:25.456 --> 01:26:38.278]  I hadn't even heard that part until I saw that this morning on the news, and I assume that they're giving a pass to the top cabinet officials and the top administration officials and the
[01:26:39.592 --> 01:26:47.755]  And the leaders of the House and Senate, the top five in the House and the top four in the Senate, I assume that that's
[01:26:48.285 --> 01:26:48.625]  I don't know.
[01:27:12.205 --> 01:27:16.749]  Almost rude or irritable or hateful in doing these things.
[01:27:16.749 --> 01:27:17.810]  No, they're rough!
[01:27:17.810 --> 01:27:18.671]  They're rough!
[01:27:18.671 --> 01:27:20.433]  They squeeze hard, that's confirmed.
[01:27:20.433 --> 01:27:23.495]  Right, and then I have this concern also.
[01:27:23.495 --> 01:27:34.265]  The plans are, right now, to purchase 1,800 of these scanners by various departments and agencies by the year 2014.
[01:27:35.906 --> 01:27:48.733]  And what I can see coming is that they'll end up buying several thousand of these things and wanting to put them in all the federal buildings for when you go in, you know, any federal building.
[01:27:48.733 --> 01:27:54.856]  And all these department agencies, they all want to get all the latest gizmos and so forth.
[01:27:55.616 --> 01:28:13.210]  There is one good thing that may come out of this, hopefully, and it would be that, number one, that more people would begin to realize that just because the word security is mentioned doesn't mean that it's necessary or that it's good or that it's not excessive or intrusive.
[01:28:14.553 --> 01:28:26.424]  And more people will begin to question these things, and then also maybe, hopefully, some of these bureaucracies will be a little bit slower to purchase a great many of these machines.
[01:28:26.424 --> 01:28:30.809]  But I just think it's, you know, we've got this big...
[01:28:31.449 --> 01:28:40.496]  ...elitist, out-of-control federal government now, and it's totally opposite from what our founding fathers thought the way things should be.
[01:28:40.496 --> 01:28:57.789]  They thought that we should solve most of our problems through the private free enterprise system, and then go to government only for a few things, and first to the local government, then to the state governments, and have the federal government, which was meant to be only a government of last resort, with very few and very little.
[01:29:00.939 --> 01:29:05.122]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:29:05.122 --> 01:29:11.527]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:29:11.527 --> 01:29:18.913]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:29:18.913 --> 01:29:23.796]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:29:23.796 --> 01:29:25.938]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:32.482]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:29:32.482 --> 01:29:34.783]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:29:34.783 --> 01:29:35.103]  Call us!
[01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.509]  At 1-800-340-7091.

[01:29:53.111 --> 01:29:53.511]  Thank you.

[01:30:04.855 --> 01:30:06.115]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:06.115 --> 01:30:09.677]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:09.677 --> 01:30:12.299]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:12.299 --> 01:30:18.162]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:18.162 --> 01:30:24.405]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:24.825 --> 01:30:30.768]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:30.768 --> 01:30:34.969]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:30:34.969 --> 01:30:39.271]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:39.271 --> 01:30:45.213]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:45.213 --> 01:30:48.775]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:48.775 --> 01:30:50.736]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:50.736 --> 01:30:51.176]  It's here.

[01:31:10.156 --> 01:31:14.917]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.

[01:32:01.593 --> 01:32:05.617]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:32:05.617 --> 01:32:08.861]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:32:08.861 --> 01:32:13.666]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:32:13.666 --> 01:32:20.053]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:32:20.053 --> 01:32:22.296]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:32:22.836 --> 01:32:23.136]  Tim Geithner?
[01:32:23.136 --> 01:32:23.636]  Bernanke?
[01:32:23.636 --> 01:32:24.317]  They're arsonists!
[01:32:24.317 --> 01:32:25.597]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:32:25.597 --> 01:32:27.838]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:32:41.724 --> 01:32:43.605]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:32:43.605 --> 01:32:49.007]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:32:49.007 --> 01:33:01.872]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:01.872 --> 01:33:03.392]  Coast to Coast.
[01:33:03.392 --> 01:33:05.453]  Direct from Austin.
[01:33:05.453 --> 01:33:08.655]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:16.294 --> 01:33:22.315]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:22.315 --> 01:33:29.876]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:29.876 --> 01:33:33.937]  We are now into our number two, 33 minutes in.
[01:33:33.937 --> 01:33:38.178]  Judge Andrew Napolitano is popping in coming up the next hour.
[01:33:38.178 --> 01:33:43.979]  Gold is up over $16 an ounce right now because of fears going on on the Korean Peninsula.
[01:33:45.148 --> 01:33:50.379]  We're going to be talking to Wayne Madsen of the Wayne Madsen Report here in just a moment.
[01:33:50.379 --> 01:33:51.461]  Wayne Madsen of course.
[01:33:53.131 --> 01:33:53.531]  We're good to go.
[01:34:19.765 --> 01:34:22.887]  And he has the WayneMadsenReport.com.
[01:34:22.887 --> 01:34:29.852]  And I wanted to get him on, you know, less than 12 hours into this Korean Peninsula situation.
[01:34:29.852 --> 01:34:35.715]  Of course, we have this report from two years ago by Paul Joseph Watson and by Ehan Dai.
[01:34:35.715 --> 01:34:40.418]  Rand lobbies Pentagon, start war to save U.S.
[01:34:40.418 --> 01:34:40.899]  economy.
[01:34:42.097 --> 01:34:45.700]  And it goes into the Rand Corporation saying they need a war.
[01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:57.728]  We also have the Washington Post here in my stack where they talk about Obama needing a war.
[01:34:57.728 --> 01:35:02.411]  David Broder does a war to be able to continue his agenda.
[01:35:02.411 --> 01:35:04.353]  I'll dig that out and pull it out and show it to you in a minute.
[01:35:05.336 --> 01:35:14.341]  But, the fact that Obama's there last week, the fact that they, the North had said, don't come into these islands, don't fire your artillery in our area, and then they sent them in to do it.
[01:35:16.224 --> 01:35:21.409]  The fact that it looks like this torpedo that hit the ship a while back ago was German.
[01:35:21.409 --> 01:35:23.170]  Again, I'm not saying the North Koreans are good, folks.
[01:35:23.170 --> 01:35:24.591]  They're proxies of the Chinese.
[01:35:24.591 --> 01:35:35.340]  But this on the heel of the Chinese, Wayne Madsen and others believe firing that missile two weeks ago as a way to menace the West ahead of the G20.
[01:35:35.340 --> 01:35:38.143]  I want to get Wayne Madsen's take on all this.
[01:35:38.143 --> 01:35:39.184]  Wayne, what's your view on it?
[01:35:40.084 --> 01:35:44.626]  Well, again, North Korea is a very paranoid regime.
[01:35:44.626 --> 01:35:48.748]  It's a Stalinist, but they've made several overtures to the West.
[01:35:48.748 --> 01:35:57.512]  I would note that this incident follows their invitation to an American scientist who took them to a new uranium enrichment facility where he saw plenty of
[01:35:58.132 --> 01:35:58.753]  We're good to go.
[01:36:19.777 --> 01:36:21.558]  Um, we have an armistice.
[01:36:21.558 --> 01:36:24.861]  We don't have a peace agreement between the two countries.
[01:36:24.861 --> 01:36:35.248]  So, um, there have been, as you mentioned, these incidents where, uh, last, uh, this past March, we had the South Korean Corvette, uh, in an area.
[01:36:35.248 --> 01:36:39.191]  Um, there was the U.S., joint U.S.-South Korean exercises.
[01:36:39.191 --> 01:36:44.775]  That was an island further to the west from where this island, this island called, uh, Yongpyong.
[01:36:44.775 --> 01:36:48.938]  Um, that, that island back in March was the westernmost island.
[01:36:49.238 --> 01:36:57.961]  But all these islands sit right off the coast of Korea, so they're highly militarized, highly sensitive areas, and when the U.S.
[01:36:57.961 --> 01:37:07.084]  and or South Koreans engage in military exercises in the area, they always engender a negative response from the North.
[01:37:07.084 --> 01:37:12.906]  We have to remember, as nutty as Kim Jong-il, who's now turning over the reins of power to his
[01:37:15.247 --> 01:37:19.908]  As crazy as he is, the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, is just as crazy.
[01:37:19.908 --> 01:37:21.748]  He's a right-winger.
[01:37:21.748 --> 01:37:23.769]  He's very unpopular in South Korea.
[01:37:23.769 --> 01:37:25.509]  The South Koreans don't like him.
[01:37:25.509 --> 01:37:27.390]  He's always rattling favors.
[01:37:27.390 --> 01:37:40.073]  And I believe, on the heels of him hosting G20, the fact that he's got a South Korean as Secretary General of the UN, all this plays into Lee Myung-bak also flexing his muscles as much as
[01:37:41.473 --> 01:37:43.674]  The people that run North Korea are flexing thirst.
[01:37:43.674 --> 01:37:52.097]  That's a recipe for disaster, and instead of coaxing the North by staging exercises in North Korean waters, the U.S.
[01:37:52.097 --> 01:38:03.520]  should be pulling back on this activity rather than projecting its military presence right into the North Koreans' face.
[01:38:06.104 --> 01:38:14.726]  Well, I've also got David Broder just a month ago, on October 31st, less than a month ago, telling Obama, hey, start a war.
[01:38:14.726 --> 01:38:17.247]  You know, North Korea, Iran, whatever.
[01:38:17.247 --> 01:38:20.328]  We've got neocons telling him to do it.
[01:38:20.328 --> 01:38:24.349]  We've got all these Obama advisers saying you need some type of crisis to look strong.
[01:38:25.429 --> 01:38:27.251]  You've got the dollar plunging.
[01:38:27.251 --> 01:38:33.798]  Now it's going back up today because people run to that safe haven because this empire has the biggest military.
[01:38:33.798 --> 01:38:35.840]  This is on the heels of the meeting over there.
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:42.948]  We know this is a provocation to send these ships into this disputed area when North Korea said they would fire on them.
[01:38:42.948 --> 01:38:45.030]  And so clearly they're looking for a provocation.
[01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:45.951]  I mean, there's no doubt of that.
[01:38:46.829 --> 01:39:00.141]  Right, and the way the news media is treating this is, you know, North Korea always is, you know, from central casting, the enemy that we love to have, secretive, unpredictable.
[01:39:00.141 --> 01:39:05.626]  I mean, how many times has James Bond been after North Koreans, you know, in the James Bond movies?
[01:39:06.786 --> 01:39:14.571]  But the fact is that the South is just as unpredictable.
[01:39:14.571 --> 01:39:21.875]  I would note that the South is now installing a ballistic missile system backed up by a radar system they're getting from Israel.
[01:39:24.053 --> 01:39:27.556]  The North doesn't look with favor on this type of thing.
[01:39:27.556 --> 01:39:30.559]  We also have China upset about similar U.S.
[01:39:30.559 --> 01:39:36.104]  naval exercises with South Korean independent ones right off the Chinese coast.
[01:39:36.104 --> 01:39:42.590]  They feel, look, if you're going to do that off our coast, we can do things off your coast to let you know that we can more than anything else.
[01:39:43.110 --> 01:39:56.719]  So, we also saw the incident with the South Korean ship being sunk, which a lot of people, including myself, and this was notified by people very close to both the North Korean government, the Chinese government, and the U.S.
[01:39:56.719 --> 01:40:06.826]  government, felt that that was a provocation to get the Japanese Prime Minister Hatayama to renege on his campaign promise of throwing the U.S.
[01:40:06.826 --> 01:40:07.667]  out of Okinawa.
[01:40:08.127 --> 01:40:09.269]  He changed his mind.
[01:40:09.269 --> 01:40:11.993]  He was attacked by his own party.
[01:40:11.993 --> 01:40:13.194]  He resigned.
[01:40:13.194 --> 01:40:14.396]  And now a pro-U.S.
[01:40:14.396 --> 01:40:22.448]  Prime Minister is in Tokyo, and he's helping rattle the states along with the Americans and South Koreans against North Korea.
[01:40:23.385 --> 01:40:25.266]  And it's a nice political diversion.
[01:40:25.266 --> 01:40:28.509]  How does this tie in going back to the Chinese missile?
[01:40:28.509 --> 01:40:34.413]  A. Have you got any more intel confirming your sources that that was a Chinese missile?
[01:40:34.413 --> 01:40:35.874]  A. B. Why did they do it?
[01:40:35.874 --> 01:40:38.456]  C. How does this tie into this latest situation?
[01:40:38.456 --> 01:40:43.440]  We know both the West uses South Korea as a proxy and China uses North Korea as a proxy.
[01:40:44.338 --> 01:40:56.641]  Right, and there's now sources very close to NORAD that are saying, yes, it was a Chinese missile and that President Obama was informed immediately by the commander of NORAD about the incident.
[01:40:56.641 --> 01:41:01.422]  And all he did, of course, was keep a tant down.
[01:41:01.422 --> 01:41:06.403]  He was getting ready to meet the Chinese president in Seoul and then again in Yokohama, Japan.
[01:41:06.403 --> 01:41:13.745]  I would also point out that Jackson Deal, in an op-ed piece in the Washington Post,
[01:41:14.245 --> 01:41:19.749]  He pointed to the amateurs running the foreign policy for the Obama Administration.
[01:41:19.749 --> 01:41:35.702]  He said basically his core advisors are his ex-Senator Hillary Clinton, an ex-Congressional staffer, Tom Donilon, his National Security Advisor, and a lawyer, Leon Panetta, who's running the CIA.
[01:41:35.702 --> 01:41:39.965]  And basically he was pointing out, where's the foreign policy gravitas there?
[01:41:39.965 --> 01:41:40.385]  It's not!
[01:41:41.787 --> 01:41:46.712]  So, you know, remember what Rahm Emanuel said, never let a good crisis go to waste.
[01:41:46.712 --> 01:41:51.758]  Is this also an attempt to boost Obama's commander-in-chief credentials?
[01:41:51.758 --> 01:41:57.645]  But I think it's coming at a very bad time when U.S.-Chinese relations are very, very frayed.
[01:41:57.645 --> 01:41:59.848]  Now, he wanted to pitch
[01:42:00.328 --> 01:42:06.655]  Some sort of associate membership status or partnership status with Russia on its missile shield.
[01:42:06.655 --> 01:42:12.121]  And the Chinese look at that as bringing NATO right to its own borders with Russia.
[01:42:12.121 --> 01:42:18.488]  And then of course trying to push the idea of India joining the UN Security Council.
[01:42:18.488 --> 01:42:20.810]  Something else that China is very much opposed to.
[01:42:20.810 --> 01:42:21.811]  So it looks like Obama is
[01:42:22.953 --> 01:42:26.356]  He's poking his finger in the Chinese eye.
[01:42:26.356 --> 01:42:37.669]  Maybe he forgets that China owns a great deal of our debt, but again, maybe this is back to the Washington Post op-ed, where, you know, this guy's not the smartest guy in the world.
[01:42:37.669 --> 01:42:43.315]  We all, you know, just because somebody speaks well, actors speak well, because they remember their lines.
[01:43:01.015 --> 01:43:02.657]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[01:44:00.538 --> 01:44:05.101]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:44:05.101 --> 01:44:06.002]  Number 1.
[01:44:06.002 --> 01:44:09.445]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:44:09.445 --> 01:44:10.305]  Number 2.
[01:44:10.305 --> 01:44:15.189]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:44:15.189 --> 01:44:15.949]  It's true.
[01:44:15.949 --> 01:44:20.813]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:44:20.813 --> 01:44:21.634]  Number 3.
[01:44:21.634 --> 01:44:25.216]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:44:25.216 --> 01:44:28.919]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:44:29.119 --> 01:44:29.919]  Number 4.
[01:44:29.919 --> 01:44:32.680]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:36.361]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:44:36.361 --> 01:44:37.141]  Number 5.
[01:44:37.141 --> 01:44:41.282]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:44:41.282 --> 01:44:46.344]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:45:13.424 --> 01:45:19.148]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:45:19.148 --> 01:45:26.114]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:45:28.932 --> 01:45:34.454]  I'm looking for America.
[01:45:34.454 --> 01:45:36.434]  We're American and be proud.

[01:47:11.474 --> 01:47:16.520]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:40.506 --> 01:47:44.051]  Last night a little angel came poppin' on the floor.
[01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:52.004]  Webster Griffin Tarbley is going to be riding shotgun with us for the rest of this hour at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:47:52.004 --> 01:48:13.238]  You better believe the circus that is the TSA molestation as they try to impart this mass mental illness of paranoia that there are all these terrorists wanting to get us so they can then set the precedent to put TSA into every airport, every bus terminal, every train station, every highway, every mall, every school.
[01:48:13.238 --> 01:48:14.299]  It's all being announced.
[01:48:14.299 --> 01:48:15.380]  They're going to be everywhere.
[01:48:15.980 --> 01:48:19.961]  As we warned you, Big Sis is now laying it out.
[01:48:19.961 --> 01:48:23.242]  But I wanted to make this point before we go to Tarpley.
[01:48:23.242 --> 01:48:25.723]  There's all these articles out today.
[01:48:25.723 --> 01:48:29.624]  Airport security moving smoothly despite opt-out day.
[01:48:29.624 --> 01:48:31.884]  And the message is you failed.
[01:48:31.884 --> 01:48:34.625]  People aren't trying to slow down the airports.
[01:48:34.625 --> 01:48:36.025]  Some have said that's their goal.
[01:48:36.025 --> 01:48:38.626]  The goal is to say no and not use your machines.
[01:48:39.551 --> 01:48:40.933]  But it's not just opt-out.
[01:48:40.933 --> 01:48:43.657]  We're saying don't put your hands on our genitals.
[01:48:43.657 --> 01:48:46.722]  Then it's, oh, we'll try to charge you $11,000.
[01:48:46.722 --> 01:48:48.785]  That's if you leave the area.
[01:48:48.785 --> 01:48:50.327]  So you sit there and you argue with them.
[01:48:50.327 --> 01:48:51.930]  You come two hours early.
[01:48:51.930 --> 01:48:52.791]  You educate them.
[01:48:52.791 --> 01:48:53.452]  You resist.
[01:48:54.318 --> 01:48:57.139]  Fox News, all of them are like, oh, go ahead and submit.
[01:48:57.139 --> 01:48:59.159]  Don't slow down the airports.
[01:48:59.159 --> 01:49:01.720]  NBC says 98% in the poll.
[01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:02.260]  Love it.
[01:49:02.260 --> 01:49:08.201]  But other polls that are scientific show 61, 72, 96% against.
[01:49:08.201 --> 01:49:11.442]  On the street, it's got to be 90% against it, what I'm seeing.
[01:49:11.442 --> 01:49:15.983]  So there's this hoax because they know if they can make you submit to this, they can do anything.
[01:49:15.983 --> 01:49:18.104]  Now, already,
[01:49:20.540 --> 01:49:24.283]  In El Paso a few months ago, they said everyone will be put to the naked body scanners.
[01:49:24.283 --> 01:49:26.225]  The TSA admits to Chicago Tribune.
[01:49:26.225 --> 01:49:29.808]  They plan on making everyone do it.
[01:49:29.808 --> 01:49:37.234]  And so yes, during big peak times, they always open up the regular lanes and don't put everybody through the scanners.
[01:49:37.234 --> 01:49:39.095]  Most of the airports don't have them yet.
[01:49:39.095 --> 01:49:44.279]  Austin gets theirs next month, and I ain't going through, and nobody's putting their hands on my genitals.
[01:49:44.279 --> 01:49:44.620]  Got it?
[01:49:47.412 --> 01:49:48.292]  I'm not a terrorist.
[01:49:48.292 --> 01:49:51.554]  Your bosses that run this country staged the terror attacks.
[01:49:51.554 --> 01:49:53.115]  I've got the evidence.
[01:49:53.115 --> 01:49:55.676]  And you're funding the other extremists.
[01:49:55.676 --> 01:49:58.217]  The government's on record protecting the underwear bomber.
[01:49:58.217 --> 01:50:00.318]  Anwar al-Awlaki's hanging out at the Pentagon.
[01:50:03.683 --> 01:50:05.084]  That's what they're doing.
[01:50:05.084 --> 01:50:05.965]  Number one, they lie.
[01:50:05.965 --> 01:50:08.387]  They say, you know, we're not putting our hands in your pants.
[01:50:08.387 --> 01:50:09.187]  They admit they are.
[01:50:09.187 --> 01:50:10.408]  There's no radiation danger.
[01:50:10.408 --> 01:50:12.189]  Liars, liars, liars, liars.
[01:50:12.189 --> 01:50:14.131]  So them saying it isn't slowing it down.
[01:50:14.131 --> 01:50:17.513]  Then I've got other reports that the airports are locked up all over the country.
[01:50:17.513 --> 01:50:19.195]  A lot of it winter storms.
[01:50:19.195 --> 01:50:20.376]  They're just a pack of liars.
[01:50:21.016 --> 01:50:22.697]  So they can do whatever they want.
[01:50:22.697 --> 01:50:25.237]  It's not about security, it's about making you submit.
[01:50:25.237 --> 01:50:29.199]  Now going to Webster Griffin at tarpleyoftarpley.net.
[01:50:29.199 --> 01:50:30.079]  He's an economist.
[01:50:30.079 --> 01:50:33.080]  He has a doctorate in history.
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:38.522]  He also features widely in Fall of the Republic and the Obama deception in our upcoming eugenics.
[01:50:39.242 --> 01:50:42.043]  Let's get Tarpley's view on this and then the TSA.
[01:50:42.043 --> 01:50:43.144]  Webster, good to have you here with us.
[01:51:06.212 --> 01:51:07.012]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:51:07.012 --> 01:51:17.277]  Maybe I could just say first, concerning this circus, as you say, in the airports, just two facts to remember that might have gotten lost after all these months.
[01:51:17.277 --> 01:51:33.844]  You remember, a couple of days after Mutala was nabbed on Christmas Day, we had this guy, Richard Wolff, this effete British fellow who talks to Olbermann on MSNBC, and he came out and said, my sources in the White House tell me
[01:51:34.424 --> 01:51:37.525]  That this incident was deliberately created.
[01:51:37.525 --> 01:51:40.406]  And then he said, we think to make Obama look bad.
[01:51:40.406 --> 01:51:43.427]  But the heart of the analysis was correct.
[01:51:43.427 --> 01:51:45.908]  The incident was deliberately created.
[01:51:45.908 --> 01:51:53.031]  And that was on MSNBC cable news within a week or ten days after the incident had occurred.
[01:51:53.031 --> 01:51:54.852]  And then of course it was covered up.
[01:51:54.852 --> 01:52:01.074]  But there was a moment where even the Obama White House realized that the rogue network had created this.
[01:52:01.654 --> 01:52:22.596]  The second thing is, in actual hearings in front of a House committee, Patrick Kennedy, the Deputy Secretary of State for Consular Affairs for Visas, said that there was an interagency task force meeting, and the State Department had come forward and said, we've given a visa to Muttalib, but we'd like to revoke it.
[01:52:22.596 --> 01:52:23.938]  We want to take it away from him.
[01:52:24.773 --> 01:52:30.958]  Because he's now in Yemen and he's going to different terror camps and so forth.
[01:52:30.958 --> 01:52:33.160]  So we want to take the visa away.
[01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:41.046]  And the answer came from an unnamed agency, still unnamed as far as I know, saying, no, no, don't touch him.
[01:52:41.046 --> 01:52:42.707]  We've got eyes on him.
[01:52:42.707 --> 01:52:43.808]  We're following him.
[01:52:43.808 --> 01:52:44.809]  He's a little fish.
[01:52:45.209 --> 01:52:47.051]  He'll lead us to the big fish.
[01:52:47.051 --> 01:52:49.233]  It's essential that you not take his visa away.
[01:52:49.233 --> 01:53:05.030]  Of course, if you took the guy's visa away, he couldn't get on the plane, and therefore no incident, no circus, no hysteria, and no opportunity for Chertoff to go on television and say, now it's time for these full-body scanners and so forth.
[01:53:05.030 --> 01:53:08.073]  So, this was a manufactured incident.
[01:53:08.793 --> 01:53:13.878]  Uh, and people should remember this, that there was, there's no basis for what they're doing.
[01:53:13.878 --> 01:53:16.041]  We don't need body scanners.
[01:53:16.041 --> 01:53:17.802]  We need mole detectors.
[01:53:17.802 --> 01:53:27.452]  We've got to have mole detectors installed at the FBI and the National Security Agency and the National Security Council and throughout the government, right?
[01:53:27.452 --> 01:53:29.214]  Mole detectors to know if people
[01:53:29.774 --> 01:53:46.561]  Are actually government officials trying to do a job, or whether they're loyal to some shadowy rogue network going back to God knows what, to 9-11, to the Kennedy assassination, the Gulf of Duncan, and all the other things that we've seen over the past decade.
[01:53:46.561 --> 01:53:48.762]  Where do you see all of this going?
[01:53:48.762 --> 01:53:53.284]  Well, it's, again, we look back to the 1930s, you can see this three-phase process, right?
[01:53:58.493 --> 01:53:59.294]  Depression.
[01:53:59.294 --> 01:54:00.895]  Economic depression.
[01:54:00.895 --> 01:54:03.117]  Followed by dictatorship.
[01:54:03.117 --> 01:54:04.759]  Followed by world war.
[01:54:04.759 --> 01:54:10.824]  And the big problem we have right now is we're in the depression phase, but we can see the dictatorship elements.
[01:54:11.940 --> 01:54:12.700]  We're good to go.
[01:54:34.066 --> 01:54:39.350]  I think the ultimate thing is, the only way to fight this is you've got to get out of the depression.
[01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:48.416]  You've got to have a broad-based economic recovery, a return to full employment, a return to prosperity, a return to expanding standards of living.
[01:54:48.416 --> 01:54:54.641]  And if you don't do that, the forces in the society pushing towards police states become overwhelming.
[01:54:54.641 --> 01:54:57.983]  Just one example, we've got this fraud closure crisis going on.
[01:54:59.718 --> 01:55:01.939]  Talk about the sanctity of private property.
[01:55:01.939 --> 01:55:03.400]  Yeah, there should be that.
[01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:05.100]  And there should be the rule of law.
[01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:15.526]  But right now we have a zombie banker can come with fake paperwork and essentially steal your house with the help of a robo-judge and a robo-signer and a bunch of corrupt people.
[01:55:15.526 --> 01:55:23.771]  I mean, that's the issue is that there's almost in history in these cycles a time when the ruling class just goes insane, hires secret police.
[01:55:24.511 --> 01:55:24.691]  This is
[01:55:42.205 --> 01:55:43.545]  Look at Ireland.
[01:55:43.545 --> 01:55:47.546]  They're now openly saying, we want foreign banks to run Ireland.
[01:55:47.546 --> 01:55:48.407]  That's the best way.
[01:55:48.407 --> 01:55:52.968]  So the banks that have engineered their collapse are now being praised as a solution.
[01:55:52.968 --> 01:55:58.309]  Economic conquest is sold as if it's some type of wonderful thing.
[01:55:58.309 --> 01:56:01.470]  And no one stops the crazy elites.
[01:56:01.470 --> 01:56:09.332]  And then they're just going to drive us into a chutzpah or arrogance or bravado-filled World War III.
[01:56:09.332 --> 01:56:10.072]  I mean, I guess that's it.
[01:56:10.788 --> 01:56:16.932]  They're going to destroy 12% of the gross national product of Ireland in the year 2011.
[01:56:16.932 --> 01:56:21.775]  Yeah, yeah, just to be clear, they say we're going into receivership to foreign banks.
[01:56:21.775 --> 01:56:26.799]  That was in Reuters with government officials saying we believe foreign banks should run us.
[01:56:26.799 --> 01:56:29.000]  I mean, this is now just brazen.
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:30.001]  We are sellouts.
[01:56:30.001 --> 01:56:30.862]  We are tyrants.
[01:56:31.542 --> 01:56:34.464]  And the banks that are taking over are the ones that engineered it.
[01:56:34.464 --> 01:56:44.790]  I mean, that's why they were brought into the EU, so they could do this raping, and next is Portugal, next is Spain, then England, then France, then Germany.
[01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:45.851]  Correct, Webster?
[01:56:45.851 --> 01:56:46.471]  Yes, certainly.
[01:56:46.471 --> 01:56:51.314]  And the thing, though, is that the forces that resist this need a program.
[01:56:51.314 --> 01:56:52.795]  For example, today in Portugal,
[01:56:53.593 --> 01:57:06.047]  We have reportedly the biggest labor action, the biggest general strike in 20 years in Portugal against the idea that a Greek or Irish-style austerity plan will come to them.
[01:57:06.047 --> 01:57:11.934]  The problem is that the people who lead this are the forces of the Second International, the Socialist International.
[01:57:11.934 --> 01:57:14.577]  That means Papandreou in Greece, socialist.
[01:57:15.357 --> 01:57:21.499]  Socrates in Portugal and other so-called socialists, and then Zapatero in Spain.
[01:57:21.499 --> 01:57:25.780]  And the demands that they make are absolutely inadequate.
[01:57:25.780 --> 01:57:28.761]  You look at the Irish austerity plan.
[01:57:28.761 --> 01:57:31.922]  They want to have the minimum wage reduced.
[01:57:32.342 --> 01:57:37.486]  For the average person, they want to have the sales tax go from 21 to 23 percent.
[01:57:37.486 --> 01:57:39.447]  Where's the tax on the banks?
[01:57:39.447 --> 01:57:41.329]  Where's the Wall Street sales tax?
[01:57:41.329 --> 01:57:42.469]  Where's the Tobin tax?
[01:57:42.469 --> 01:57:43.810]  The turnover tax?
[01:57:43.810 --> 01:57:45.612]  The way to make the banks pay?
[01:57:51.158 --> 01:57:54.201]  Folks, you've heard us talk about Home Gain before.
