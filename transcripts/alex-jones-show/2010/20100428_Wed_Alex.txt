[00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.071]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:00:03.671 --> 00:00:06.533]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:13.378 --> 00:00:14.979]  You've all seen it on the news.
[00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:16.500]  It's slave trade.
[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.722]  The naked body scanners recording your genitals.
[00:00:21.175 --> 00:00:24.057]  And by the way, I'm going to announce the winners tomorrow.
[00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:28.960]  I always get behind on these contests because there's scores of videos to watch, but I've got to narrow down to just a few.
[00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.783]  I will announce tomorrow absolutely the winners of the Naked Body.
[00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:38.532]  Contest video that's now educating so many people out there.
[00:00:39.193 --> 00:00:41.174]  The TSA knows it's an act of submission.
[00:00:41.194 --> 00:00:42.655]  Now they have mobile trucks they want.
[00:00:42.695 --> 00:00:44.817]  We've played the Homeland Security videos.
[00:00:45.097 --> 00:00:47.079]  We're outside sports stadiums or events.
[00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:49.661]  They're going to make you go through these naked body scanners.
[00:00:50.422 --> 00:00:59.810]  But you've seen it on the news where they get women and men, but especially women, and the TSA guards take their hands and go around the women's breast.
[00:01:00.951 --> 00:01:08.403]  And Paul Watson in England talked about his girlfriend and I talked to her on the phone.
[00:01:08.424 --> 00:01:09.706]  She said it's very painful.
[00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:13.211]  But imagine having people
[00:01:15.126 --> 00:01:19.489]  Squeezing your breasts, putting their hands between your legs, doing all of this.
[00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.234]  But what happened with Christine Ebersole is that she said, no, you're not going to touch my breast.
[00:01:25.874 --> 00:01:27.756]  Because, you know, there's a little piece of metal in her bra.
[00:01:28.236 --> 00:01:32.680]  And so they let her on through, but then basically sent a SWAT team after her as an act of submission.
[00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:34.469]  Christine Ebersole.
[00:01:34.489 --> 00:01:37.451]  ChristineEbersole.com is an American actress and singer.
[00:01:38.332 --> 00:01:41.914]  She's been a veteran of television, film and Broadway for a number of years.
[00:01:42.295 --> 00:01:51.501]  She starred in a number of television programs, including Saturday Night Live, One Life to Live, Will & Grace, Shoot Me, Just Shoot Me and Murphy Brown.
[00:01:52.161 --> 00:01:59.426]  She found considerable success also appearing in Oklahoma Camelot, Dinner at Eight, Steel, Magnolias.
[00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:07.573]  42nd Street, which she won the Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical, and I've gotten a chance to know her.
[00:02:07.613 --> 00:02:20.524]  She's a 9-11 skeptic, a 9-11 truther, somebody that has a lot of courage, and I've had a chance to, you know, march with her in Lower Manhattan, and had a chance to go out with her and her husband for dinner.
[00:02:20.564 --> 00:02:23.666]  She's a great lady, and again, we appreciate her coming on with us.
[00:02:23.686 --> 00:02:27.049]  She called me, I guess it was Saturday,
[00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:35.635]  Uh, somewhat agitated, but still controlled, saying she was on the plane, that she'd just basically been SWAT teamed at the airport.
[00:02:36.396 --> 00:02:41.980]  And, uh, again, this is psychological conditioning to then have these type of activities on the streets.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.503]  They now have federal grants for police to take blood without warrants all over the country.
[00:02:47.263 --> 00:02:48.665]  In many states this is happening.
[00:02:49.265 --> 00:02:55.631]  And it's just really getting into our comfort zones, really getting into our space, doing things that are more authoritarian.
[00:02:55.651 --> 00:02:58.473]  You know, the Nazis stopped you at checkpoints and asked for papers.
[00:02:58.934 --> 00:03:00.055]  Well, now they want your blood.
[00:03:00.115 --> 00:03:01.456]  Now they want to scan your body.
[00:03:01.496 --> 00:03:06.961]  The British government admits, and our government admits, these body scanners violate child porn laws, but they don't care.
[00:03:07.221 --> 00:03:09.023]  Christine Ebersole, thanks for joining us.
[00:03:09.531 --> 00:03:11.392]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[00:03:11.452 --> 00:03:21.499]  I really think this is an important story to let people know that we have rights as sovereign human beings, and I think I was exercising them on that Sunday in Burbank Airport.
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.382]  But I just wanted to share with you just kind of the straight up about what happened.
[00:03:27.303 --> 00:03:36.689]  I've been traveling a lot because I'm a singer, and I've been doing concerts around the country, and I first became concerned, you know, at that staged
[00:03:37.791 --> 00:03:52.297]  Underwear bomber Christmas pageant as I call it you know which allowed them to put in the scanners in Chicago and I was very worried about that because I thought I'm not going to go through the scanners I'm not going to subject myself to the radiation and let alone that it's a violation of my privacy.
[00:03:53.217 --> 00:04:17.185]  So, um, I did stop through Chicago and I was, kind of had spent some sleepless nights rehearsing what I was going to say, but I was able to circumvent that because I, you know, because they make it random and they do these random sort of drills and they just keep you off balance so you never know what's going to hit you at what time or when, but at this particular case I was able to circumvent it and, you know, go through a place that was not
[00:04:17.905 --> 00:04:20.047]  Um, a scanner, a naked body scanner.
[00:04:20.508 --> 00:04:26.694]  However, when I did go through the metal detector and didn't put off any alarms in Chicago, they patted me down.
[00:04:26.794 --> 00:04:27.935]  They said, I have to pat you down.
[00:04:28.255 --> 00:04:32.179]  And I never said anything, you know, because you're always surprised when it's a new experience.
[00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.801]  You don't really have the wherewithal to say the things that you want to say.
[00:04:35.362 --> 00:04:40.667]  But afterwards, I just felt this sort of toxic residue and felt ashamed and felt embarrassed and humiliated.
[00:04:41.227 --> 00:04:42.909]  And it stayed with me for a long time.
[00:04:42.929 --> 00:04:59.803]  And then the second time that it happened, when I traveled again, and I had gone through the metal detectors and made no sound, but then it's always, in my case, when a female guard is, it's almost like the prison, you know, the female prison guard, you know, that wants to just show dominance.
[00:05:00.463 --> 00:05:02.004]  Um, whenever it's a female.
[00:05:02.084 --> 00:05:06.845]  I don't really get it when it's going through when there's men behind the... Yeah, this is a prisoner.
[00:05:06.865 --> 00:05:13.287]  I mean, we're all being trained, people who've never been inside a jail, to go through a prison frisking procedure.
[00:05:13.547 --> 00:05:13.727]  Yeah.
[00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:18.649]  So it's usually, it's always the women that pick me out randomly and say, you have to be patted down.
[00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:20.969]  So then the second time it happened, I said, why?
[00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.070]  Why are you patting me down?
[00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.570]  It's random.
[00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.170]  So then I let her do it again.
[00:05:24.591 --> 00:05:25.771]  And again, I felt the split
[00:05:27.557 --> 00:05:33.062]  Which again sets the precedent that we all randomly are searched getting rid of the Fourth and Fifth Amendment.
[00:05:33.623 --> 00:05:34.043]  Exactly.
[00:05:34.684 --> 00:05:44.353]  So what happened was I kind of forgot about it and I did a concert in Northridge on Saturday night and Sunday morning I was flying to San Francisco so I went through the Burbank Airport.
[00:05:44.973 --> 00:05:46.033]  So my flight was around 9.30.
[00:05:46.153 --> 00:05:48.234]  I get to the airport around 8.15.
[00:05:48.754 --> 00:05:56.716]  And one of the first things that happened was when I'm putting on my shoes, you know, to put them in the security bin, all of a sudden somebody from Homeland Security starts shouting.
[00:05:57.176 --> 00:06:00.977]  I don't know what they're saying because, you know, it's all new and it's just sort of chaotic.
[00:06:01.457 --> 00:06:04.798]  And everybody's ordered to freeze in their spot.
[00:06:05.078 --> 00:06:06.418]  Whatever they're doing, freeze.
[00:06:07.543 --> 00:06:10.825]  And then some time goes by, and then you're able to continue what you're doing.
[00:06:10.965 --> 00:06:15.907]  And again, this is so Orwellian, they're just adding more and more controls, more and more harassment.
[00:06:16.427 --> 00:06:20.349]  And they do this with the school kids in these drills now too, training us how to be prisoners.
[00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:21.350]  Exactly.
[00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.711]  So I asked one of the guards, I said, what was that about?
[00:06:23.731 --> 00:06:25.872]  He said, it's just a drill, man, in case something happens.
[00:06:26.874 --> 00:06:31.438]  So then after I take, you know, my shoes off and everything and I go through, and I'm not wearing any jewelry, nothing.
[00:06:31.578 --> 00:06:32.739]  I don't set off any alarms.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:41.026]  Oh, there's a woman guard on the other side and she says, um, you have to go behind, right behind the metal detector is sort of a glass room where everybody can see.
[00:06:41.687 --> 00:06:46.571]  Which again is part of the public humiliation, training you to just put up with anything.
[00:06:47.632 --> 00:06:50.675]  So she takes me back into the glass room and she says, I have to pat you down.
[00:06:50.715 --> 00:06:51.936]  I said, I don't want to be patted down.
[00:06:53.604 --> 00:06:55.267]  So that kind of surprised him a little bit.
[00:06:55.307 --> 00:06:58.331]  I said, you can use the wand, but I don't want you to touch me.
[00:06:59.353 --> 00:07:06.223]  So, um, they kind of ignored it a little bit, you know, because they were... Which is a basic human right to not be touched.
[00:07:07.256 --> 00:07:11.619]  I mean, again, they're just... I mean, they're blowing past all these boundaries.
[00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:18.863]  And I know I keep interrupting, I just want to point out how each part of this has been psychologically designed to humiliate you and break your will.
[00:07:18.903 --> 00:07:19.263]  Go ahead.
[00:07:19.323 --> 00:07:19.704]  Exactly.
[00:07:20.104 --> 00:07:22.025]  So, um, I said you can use the wand.
[00:07:22.065 --> 00:07:28.549]  So she has me, first of all, sit down and look at the bottom of my feet to make sure there's no bomb-making material on my bare feet.
[00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:35.033]  And then I'm supposed to spread my legs and stand on the image of feet on the floor.
[00:07:35.871 --> 00:07:48.076]  And so at this certain distance, you know, so I'm spreading my legs, and she says, if the wand goes off, I'm going to have to touch the spot where the wand, you know, makes the noise.
[00:07:49.257 --> 00:07:56.360]  So the bra that I was wearing has wire in it, and you know, metal, there's little metal things in the strap.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:03.463]  So she gets to the point where it's underneath my breast, and the alarm goes off.
[00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:11.375]  And, you know, rather than touching me there, I lifted my shirt and showed her my bra.
[00:08:11.655 --> 00:08:14.617]  I said, this is my bra, and you see the wire underneath that?
[00:08:15.057 --> 00:08:16.358]  That's what's making the sound.
[00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:20.141]  This was in lieu of having her touch me there, because I instructed.
[00:08:20.221 --> 00:08:21.462]  I did not want her to touch me.
[00:08:21.622 --> 00:08:31.489]  And again, here you are, this evil, guilty person for having tiny little clips in your bra, and you're now the prisoner in having to go through this.
[00:08:31.529 --> 00:08:32.590]  This is the new American way.
[00:08:33.117 --> 00:08:41.204]  So because I lifted my bra in this glass area, I mean, I lifted my shirt and showed my bra, which everyone could see.
[00:08:41.224 --> 00:08:42.265]  I didn't mind.
[00:08:42.785 --> 00:08:45.387]  You know, you wear that in the summertime when you're at the beach.
[00:08:47.029 --> 00:08:48.170]  But I don't want her to touch me.
[00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:53.574]  So I showed the bra, and that's when the supervisor came in, or what I assume was the supervisor.
[00:08:53.594 --> 00:08:55.356]  And she said, are we having a problem here?
[00:08:55.396 --> 00:08:56.597]  I said, no, there's no problem.
[00:08:58.291 --> 00:08:59.892]  We having a problem here, slave?
[00:08:59.912 --> 00:09:00.832]  Uh-huh, yeah.
[00:09:01.292 --> 00:09:03.513]  And it was with a slight, of course, attitude.
[00:09:03.833 --> 00:09:09.536]  And basically went on to lecture me that I'm causing trouble because I'm impeding the security measures.
[00:09:10.056 --> 00:09:14.758]  And she went on to explain again, if there was any sound, she'd have to touch that spot.
[00:09:14.798 --> 00:09:19.460]  I said, well, ma'am, I answer to a higher authority.
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.642]  And I am a sovereign human being, which means I am the supreme authority over my body.
[00:09:25.662 --> 00:09:27.143]  And I have a right
[00:09:27.856 --> 00:09:30.359]  As a sovereign human being, to ask you not to touch me.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.260]  I'm not a criminal.
[00:09:32.861 --> 00:09:34.242]  I haven't been accused of a crime.
[00:09:35.303 --> 00:09:37.145]  Are you suspecting me of something?
[00:09:37.545 --> 00:09:38.667]  Are you looking for something?
[00:09:39.007 --> 00:09:41.850]  We're looking, she said, we're looking for bra bombs.
[00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:48.136]  You see, now they've moved from the shoe to the underwear and now to the bra.
[00:09:49.419 --> 00:09:58.747]  And it's interesting how now they're going to the traditionally in tribal, you know, law, the more vulnerable group.
[00:09:59.327 --> 00:10:03.130]  The women who bear the children that are there for the tribe to protect.
[00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.533]  And let's remember, we've proven the shoe bomber was staged.
[00:10:06.593 --> 00:10:10.316]  It's been conclusively proven that the underwear bomber was staged.
[00:10:10.736 --> 00:10:11.977]  All of this is staged.
[00:10:12.517 --> 00:10:15.620]  And now they admit Homeland Security is for the American people.
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.782]  It was never for the cave people.
[00:10:19.198 --> 00:10:36.029]  Well, after she gave me the lecture, and she said, you know, the reason why I was profiled was because I was wearing loose clothing, and I went, you know, and I took, anyway, I took off all the loose clothing so that you could just see a t-shirt that was sort of tight-fitting, and I lifted up my pants legs, and I showed her my bare legs, which also upset her.
[00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:40.312]  She did not want me to do that, because then that would mean that she couldn't touch my body, you see.
[00:10:41.167 --> 00:10:43.369]  So, um, then I said, is everything okay?
[00:10:43.429 --> 00:10:44.350]  Am I free to go now?
[00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:50.755]  Are you satisfied that you haven't, you know, that I'm not a bomber, I'm not a terrorist, and are you satisfied that you haven't been able to find anything?
[00:10:51.755 --> 00:10:59.722]  And she said yes, but she basically said, I would suggest you don't fly anymore, because flying is a privilege, and I can call the police and have them taking you off.
[00:10:59.962 --> 00:11:08.729]  Yeah, they say owning a gun's a privilege, traveling's a privilege, everything's a privilege now, and we pay all our taxes to the government, and they turn all these
[00:11:09.389 --> 00:11:13.791]  Minimum wage goons loose on us, but then that's only the beginning of the story.
[00:11:14.131 --> 00:11:15.612]  They were going to make you submit.
[00:11:15.692 --> 00:11:22.975]  They were going to show everybody what happens to somebody that talks back to the warden in the prison.
[00:11:23.215 --> 00:11:25.356]  Because we're a prison planet and we're about to go to break.
[00:11:25.376 --> 00:11:27.237]  We're going to come back with Christine Ebersole.
[00:11:27.257 --> 00:11:32.320]  ChristineEbersole.com and talk about what she describes as her SWAT teaming.
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:41.523]  At the gate, after she'd gone through the slave boot camp training grid, where they're always adding more suppression incrementally.
[00:11:42.063 --> 00:11:48.905]  Look, this is meant to prepare you for forced inoculation, forced DNA removal, DNA databases.
[00:11:48.925 --> 00:11:49.726]  That's all admitted.
[00:11:49.986 --> 00:11:50.786]  It's all over the news.
[00:11:50.826 --> 00:11:53.347]  They take babies' blood at birth for almost 38 years.
[00:11:53.807 --> 00:11:55.788]  This is just a lawless group of scum.
[00:11:55.808 --> 00:11:58.428]  And of course, the average TSA worker is not a bad person.
[00:11:58.448 --> 00:11:59.869]  They're just ignorant like the general public.
[00:12:02.182 --> 00:12:03.322]  This is not a drill.
[00:12:03.402 --> 00:12:05.383]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:12:05.903 --> 00:12:07.524]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[00:12:07.804 --> 00:12:14.926]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:19.387]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[00:12:19.427 --> 00:12:29.690]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.

[00:13:59.907 --> 00:14:02.249]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:14:02.289 --> 00:14:04.510]  We are part of a New World Order.

[00:14:07.832 --> 00:14:12.555]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:14:12.935 --> 00:14:17.138]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:14:17.438 --> 00:14:19.761]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:14:19.781 --> 00:14:22.304]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:14:22.324 --> 00:14:25.247]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:14:25.587 --> 00:14:33.196]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:14:33.516 --> 00:14:38.759]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:14:38.919 --> 00:14:41.701]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:14:41.761 --> 00:14:45.203]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:14:45.443 --> 00:14:46.364]  And I got news for you.

[00:16:01.656 --> 00:16:06.079]  Tony Award winning, best leading actress, Christina Ebersole.
[00:16:06.159 --> 00:16:07.801]  Great lady is our guest.
[00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:09.102]  Charming, intelligent.
[00:16:10.387 --> 00:16:11.287]  Filled with courage.
[00:16:13.388 --> 00:16:18.069]  She's one of the people that helped educate Rosie O'Donnell about 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:16:18.089 --> 00:16:18.929]  She's good friends with her.
[00:16:18.969 --> 00:16:22.070]  We appreciate Rosie O'Donnell's courage on that front.
[00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:24.630]  That's what I appreciate is people that stand up and tell the truth.
[00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.891]  I don't even have to agree with them on some of their politics.
[00:16:26.951 --> 00:16:28.811]  As long as you love the truth, that's what matters.
[00:16:29.331 --> 00:16:31.672]  Now, Christine, so they go ahead and let you go.
[00:16:32.672 --> 00:16:48.436]  Through your privilege, they give you your privilege as government god, as the feds that have seized the airports, now seizing the roads, announcing they have TSA and checkpoints all over the country now, expanding this, training our children how to be slaves, and so you go on towards the gate.
[00:16:48.476 --> 00:16:49.176]  What happens next?
[00:16:49.196 --> 00:16:56.038]  Well, you know, we were early, so I was sitting at the gate with my musical director, John Otto, for about 45 minutes.
[00:16:56.658 --> 00:17:00.219]  We were just talking, and I was kind of saying, do you believe what just happened?
[00:17:00.359 --> 00:17:01.679]  Thinking that was the end of the story.
[00:17:02.412 --> 00:17:06.315]  And then they announced that they're going to begin boarding, and I was on one of those short flights.
[00:17:06.415 --> 00:17:14.300]  So, you know how it is, Alex, where you don't have assigned seating, but they'll say, you know, you're in A, 15 to 18, so you kind of get in a line, and there's three different lines.
[00:17:14.981 --> 00:17:16.342]  So, everybody was in line.
[00:17:16.362 --> 00:17:17.603]  They announced that we're boarding.
[00:17:18.003 --> 00:17:22.546]  We all get in line, so everyone's facing the front, like the front of a classroom.
[00:17:23.407 --> 00:17:28.130]  All of a sudden, there's about six security members
[00:17:28.903 --> 00:17:33.786]  They were different, and they were different than the ones that had me at the security checkpoint.
[00:17:33.846 --> 00:17:35.006]  They were a different group.
[00:17:36.287 --> 00:17:38.428]  And they said, Ma'am, we need you to come over to me.
[00:17:38.748 --> 00:17:39.488]  Come over here right now.
[00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:40.269]  I've got to pat you down.
[00:17:41.667 --> 00:17:42.668]  Let's take me out of the group.
[00:17:59.684 --> 00:18:00.764]  I need to pat you down right now.
[00:18:00.784 --> 00:18:01.984]  So another lie again.
[00:18:02.044 --> 00:18:03.685]  This is supposedly random.
[00:18:03.725 --> 00:18:05.745]  So it's just congenital lying.
[00:18:05.785 --> 00:18:06.825]  A culture of deceit.
[00:18:06.905 --> 00:18:07.146]  Yeah.
[00:18:07.466 --> 00:18:08.186]  Twice random?
[00:18:08.286 --> 00:18:08.866]  I don't think so.
[00:18:09.166 --> 00:18:10.026]  And that's what John said.
[00:18:10.046 --> 00:18:10.666]  He goes, what do you mean?
[00:18:10.706 --> 00:18:11.246]  We went through that.
[00:18:11.286 --> 00:18:12.447]  It was random back at security.
[00:18:12.467 --> 00:18:13.427]  It's not random now.
[00:18:13.887 --> 00:18:14.787]  You're selecting her out.
[00:18:14.827 --> 00:18:15.647]  They wouldn't answer him.
[00:18:16.247 --> 00:18:21.388]  So, um, I start to take, I go to the front and I said, I thought we already went through this.
[00:18:21.548 --> 00:18:23.309]  I told you, I don't want you to touch me.
[00:18:23.709 --> 00:18:28.790]  And I start to take my coat off and I start to take my shirt off, my outer shirt off.
[00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:33.175]  No, they've got to have the act of submission.
[00:18:45.305 --> 00:18:46.606]  I mean, this is their great power.
[00:18:46.666 --> 00:18:48.267]  How many have been caught being pedophiles?
[00:18:48.548 --> 00:18:50.849]  How many have been caught demanding women give them sex?
[00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:52.571]  I mean, this is their domination.
[00:18:53.151 --> 00:18:53.351]  Yeah.
[00:18:53.732 --> 00:18:55.253]  So I continued to take my coat off.
[00:18:55.553 --> 00:18:56.754]  I wasn't listening to them.
[00:18:56.914 --> 00:18:58.996]  And they were continuing to yell for the police.
[00:18:59.576 --> 00:19:02.018]  And then I said, I see.
[00:19:02.038 --> 00:19:07.242]  This is because I said I didn't want you to touch me back at security.
[00:19:07.662 --> 00:19:09.324]  So you're showing me who's boss now.
[00:19:10.024 --> 00:19:11.405]  You're making an example of me.
[00:19:11.725 --> 00:19:12.386]  Ma'am, it's random.
[00:19:12.806 --> 00:19:14.307]  I said, are you having a problem with me?
[00:19:14.327 --> 00:19:15.788]  No, ma'am, you've been a model passenger.
[00:19:15.949 --> 00:19:16.969]  You've been a model passenger.
[00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:18.571]  Now, now, put your arms out.
[00:19:18.591 --> 00:19:19.311]  We gotta pat you down.
[00:19:20.532 --> 00:19:22.113]  So, and everybody's watching it.
[00:19:22.433 --> 00:19:23.334]  Everybody's watching it.
[00:19:23.734 --> 00:19:25.155]  So, I mean, I never raised my voice.
[00:19:25.176 --> 00:19:25.936]  Never did any of that.
[00:19:26.336 --> 00:19:27.537]  I, I put my arms out.
[00:19:27.557 --> 00:19:29.399]  I said, I already told you I didn't want you to touch me.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:39.046]  And they went ahead and they patted me up and down, you know, with a t-shirt on that's, you know, clinging to my body, so, and pants, the bottom.
[00:19:39.833 --> 00:19:41.434]  Which I already showed them back in the picture.
[00:19:41.474 --> 00:19:43.676]  I lifted up my pants, I showed them my bare legs underneath.
[00:19:43.776 --> 00:19:45.798]  But, you know, they want to show who's boss.
[00:19:46.398 --> 00:19:50.721]  And then, when I said, am I the only one that's being picked out randomly?
[00:19:50.741 --> 00:19:51.942]  No, ma'am, we're waiting for you to get on the plane.
[00:19:51.962 --> 00:19:52.523]  Now get on the plane.
[00:19:52.543 --> 00:19:53.504]  You want to get on the plane now?
[00:19:53.784 --> 00:19:54.464]  You want to get on the plane?
[00:19:54.484 --> 00:19:55.125]  You want to fly today?
[00:19:55.145 --> 00:19:56.226]  Want to fly today?
[00:19:56.246 --> 00:20:00.209]  So that was the deal there.
[00:20:00.928 --> 00:20:01.848]  But of course, I wasn't.
[00:20:01.868 --> 00:20:05.430]  You see, they wait until everyone's boarding, and I've got a concert.
[00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:08.531]  I've got to, you know, I've got to make money.
[00:20:08.571 --> 00:20:09.731]  I have a family to support.
[00:20:10.751 --> 00:20:12.672]  And so, I'm not going to jeopardize that.
[00:20:13.252 --> 00:20:16.493]  No, it's all been psychologically figured out to make you submit.
[00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:20.915]  Now, you described this to me as SWAT team-like.
[00:20:21.195 --> 00:20:21.395]  Yeah.
[00:20:21.795 --> 00:20:30.258]  Well, it was, because they had, like, some gun... I mean, I didn't see any guns, but I'm just saying, like, metaphorically a SWAT team, because, like, they all... There's, like, six or seven people descending on me.
[00:20:33.166 --> 00:20:36.088]  I've seen countless YouTube videos on local news of TSA going crazy.
[00:20:36.128 --> 00:20:38.149]  Have you seen the one where the military vet
[00:20:53.132 --> 00:20:53.953]  In his uniform.
[00:20:55.574 --> 00:20:56.555]  They want to search him.
[00:20:56.595 --> 00:20:57.575]  They want to humiliate him.
[00:20:57.615 --> 00:21:01.618]  So when he just talks back, they beat him up and then charge him with assaulting him.
[00:21:01.818 --> 00:21:06.162]  Or the new thing is making people who can't walk get up.
[00:21:06.302 --> 00:21:10.865]  And if a person won't get out of a wheelchair, they just tell you that you're not going to fly.
[00:21:11.425 --> 00:21:14.728]  So now they make people get out of their wheelchairs who can't walk.
[00:21:14.788 --> 00:21:16.349]  And so families have to try to hold them up.
[00:21:16.409 --> 00:21:17.990]  And then they get screamed at.
[00:21:18.711 --> 00:21:19.871]  I mean, I don't want to fly through
[00:21:20.692 --> 00:21:22.693]  George W. Bush, or George H.W.
[00:21:22.713 --> 00:21:31.378]  Bush Airport in Houston, because I've flown through it three times, and once internationally, and they're just screaming at everyone, yelling.
[00:21:31.998 --> 00:21:33.139]  It's like Planet of the Apes.
[00:21:33.159 --> 00:21:42.564]  We're like running, and the TSA's screaming and yelling, and people are freaked out, and they're screaming at old women on crutches, and just foaming at the mouth, and insane power trips.
[00:21:43.204 --> 00:21:47.406]  Let's talk about what you'd like to be done about this when we come back.
[00:21:47.467 --> 00:21:47.887]  Stay with us.
[00:21:50.151 --> 00:21:53.172]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:21:54.093 --> 00:21:56.874]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:59.775 --> 00:22:00.756]  What's your home worth?
[00:22:00.936 --> 00:22:02.857]  How can you compare local real estate agents?

[00:23:12.301 --> 00:23:16.484]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:23:16.804 --> 00:23:19.145]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:23:19.165 --> 00:23:21.686]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:23:22.046 --> 00:23:24.607]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:23:24.948 --> 00:23:32.551]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:23:32.884 --> 00:23:38.169]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:23:38.269 --> 00:23:40.551]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:23:40.592 --> 00:23:44.575]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:23:44.816 --> 00:23:45.737]  And I got news for you.
[00:23:45.897 --> 00:23:47.198]  You're everyone else.
[00:23:47.238 --> 00:23:48.239]  Invisible Empire.

[00:23:59.229 --> 00:24:00.490]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:05.872]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:24:06.112 --> 00:24:10.734]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:24:11.134 --> 00:24:11.514]  It's true.
[00:24:11.614 --> 00:24:16.156]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:24:16.696 --> 00:24:21.399]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.841]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:24:24.241 --> 00:24:28.844]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:24:29.044 --> 00:24:29.945]  And here's the best part.
[00:24:30.165 --> 00:24:32.927]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:24:33.227 --> 00:24:36.529]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:39.691]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:24:40.032 --> 00:24:41.933]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:24:42.253 --> 00:24:43.174]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:24:46.816 --> 00:24:47.836]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:24:48.256 --> 00:24:55.558]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:24:55.878 --> 00:24:58.038]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:24:58.178 --> 00:25:12.221]  All right, I'm going to get into the global carbon tax collapsing at the national and international level, but not at the local level.
[00:25:12.781 --> 00:25:14.822]  We're winning battles, but not the war yet.
[00:25:15.862 --> 00:25:19.047]  Though we're well on our way to exposing that fraud.
[00:25:19.067 --> 00:25:23.795]  I've got some other false flag terror news I want to go over and your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:25:23.815 --> 00:25:24.396]  So Christine Ebersole.
[00:25:30.277 --> 00:25:31.017]  I don't know.
[00:25:50.859 --> 00:25:58.066]  You know, had them pull out a little shampoo bottle that even follows their specs in Billings, Montana, and start screaming at me getting off on it.
[00:25:58.946 --> 00:26:00.328]  And it seems to be certain airports.
[00:26:00.348 --> 00:26:01.789]  You go through some, they're really nice.
[00:26:01.889 --> 00:26:04.251]  It's not very oppressive.
[00:26:04.271 --> 00:26:05.573]  You go through others, it's worse.
[00:26:06.173 --> 00:26:07.174]  Let's be specific.
[00:26:07.274 --> 00:26:11.238]  What airport did this happen to you in, and have you seen that it's worse in certain airports?
[00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:19.854]  Well, of course, Chicago, because that's, you know, really a central area for international flying.
[00:26:20.234 --> 00:26:21.775]  I think the most flights go out of there.
[00:26:22.075 --> 00:26:29.700]  But this was in Burbank, Bob Hope Burbank Airport in California, in Burbank, California.
[00:26:31.101 --> 00:26:35.684]  Well, I think really, Alex, what I've noticed is this happening incrementally.
[00:26:36.145 --> 00:26:39.086]  It's like the Jews, you know, didn't start out at the camp.
[00:26:39.827 --> 00:26:41.168]  They start out with the start.
[00:26:42.031 --> 00:26:43.232]  Then they can't go out after 6.
[00:26:44.373 --> 00:26:45.633]  Then they're in the ghetto.
[00:26:45.914 --> 00:26:49.316]  And then, you know, it's finally leave your name on the luggage at the platform and we'll get it to you.
[00:26:49.976 --> 00:26:50.637]  But it doesn't happen.
[00:26:50.797 --> 00:26:52.238]  It's what you were discussing earlier.
[00:26:52.258 --> 00:26:54.739]  It's the incremental that's happening.
[00:26:54.759 --> 00:26:58.762]  And I noticed that they stopped using the wands and then they start using the pat-down.
[00:26:59.674 --> 00:27:02.735]  This is like something that's been kind of recent for me, anyway.
[00:27:02.935 --> 00:27:04.556]  Well, think about what a big deal this is.
[00:27:04.976 --> 00:27:12.939]  Naked body scanners putting their hands on you, asking you questions, and it only gets worse and worse and worse, and it's training them.
[00:27:13.459 --> 00:27:21.302]  It's training the government employees that all of this is acceptable, and again, it's all being done by design.
[00:27:21.862 --> 00:27:23.863]  Where do you see this is headed?
[00:27:23.903 --> 00:27:24.643]  Because we know that
[00:27:25.188 --> 00:27:31.630]  Well, I think really what the hope is, is to sort of view this experience as non-violent resistance.
[00:27:32.511 --> 00:27:35.352]  And, you know, like Rosa Parks didn't give up her seat.
[00:27:35.952 --> 00:27:38.153]  You know, don't give up your seat at the lunch counter.
[00:27:38.213 --> 00:27:38.993]  Know your rights.
[00:27:39.173 --> 00:27:46.536]  Know that we are, because the mere fact that we were created and that we live on this earth gives us rights.
[00:27:47.196 --> 00:27:48.977]  And we are sovereign human beings.
[00:27:49.117 --> 00:27:50.257]  And know your rights.
[00:27:50.377 --> 00:27:52.098]  And that's what we teach our children, isn't it?
[00:27:52.791 --> 00:27:55.595]  We tell our children, listen, don't let any strangers touch you.
[00:27:56.836 --> 00:27:58.057]  You know, this is your body.
[00:27:58.077 --> 00:28:01.301]  And you need to protect it, and you speak out.
[00:28:01.802 --> 00:28:03.324]  Does that change when you become an adult?
[00:28:03.344 --> 00:28:05.767]  And then all of a sudden you submit yourself?
[00:28:06.287 --> 00:28:08.290]  It's okay to teach your children, but not for yourself?
[00:28:09.235 --> 00:28:10.717]  You don't have to protect yourself, though, you see?
[00:28:11.017 --> 00:28:16.402]  That's the thing, is that, you know, that we don't understand how powerful we are as human beings.
[00:28:16.963 --> 00:28:17.903]  We don't understand that.
[00:28:18.224 --> 00:28:26.452]  And that's... If everybody went to the airport and said, I don't want you to touch me, and I don't want... I'm not going to the scanners, the whole thing would collapse!
[00:28:27.489 --> 00:28:30.551]  It's because we're in agreement with it, because we think we don't have any rights.
[00:28:30.591 --> 00:28:43.278]  I was talking to somebody in front of the line, you know, on my way back to California from San Francisco, and she was making a joke about, like, you know, she knew it was ridiculous, but she was making a joke about the scanners, you know, we'll all have to go through the scanners.
[00:28:43.338 --> 00:28:44.519]  I said, I'm not going through the scanners.
[00:28:45.339 --> 00:28:47.901]  She said, you know, she looked at me like, we have a choice?
[00:28:47.921 --> 00:28:50.002]  I said, you have a choice.
[00:28:51.423 --> 00:28:52.884]  You are a sovereign human being.
[00:28:53.024 --> 00:28:55.025]  You are the supreme authority over your body.
[00:28:57.418 --> 00:29:03.901]  Unless you're a convicted prisoner and they're treating us like convicted prisoners and the low-level people don't even know what they're doing.
[00:29:04.281 --> 00:29:06.002]  They're just as ignorant as the general public.
[00:29:06.342 --> 00:29:12.745]  But the globalists know exactly what they're doing and this is a key part of their overall operation.
[00:29:13.485 --> 00:29:21.349]  This is a drill or a boot camp training us that all of America and all the world is basically a giant re-education camp.
[00:29:21.369 --> 00:29:21.890]  That's right.
[00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:28.517]  So I think it's just a matter of practicing nonviolent resistance and knowing the rights of man.
[00:29:32.725 --> 00:29:37.350]  Well, I mean, I don't really believe in the classic term karma, but I do believe in you reap what you sow.
[00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:49.482]  I can't imagine the bad mojo, or whatever you want to call it, of grabbing people's genitals, rubbing people's breasts, dominating people, putting them through naked body scanners.
[00:29:49.942 --> 00:29:54.186]  And how as Americans, or as British, or as global, or as Europeans,
[00:29:55.916 --> 00:30:03.702]  Well, you let them take your three-year-olds, because now TSA has said, just like England, they are phasing it in, it will be mandatory, they're just, quote, acclimating the public.
[00:30:03.962 --> 00:30:05.463]  I mean, that's TSA's own words.
[00:30:05.844 --> 00:30:09.907]  So we're now going to put our babies in body scanners that pound us with radiation?
[00:30:09.947 --> 00:30:19.954]  Now they're saying, well, women may have people sew in bombs inside their breasts, so now we may have to have chest X-rays, which nobody doubts cause cancer.
[00:30:19.974 --> 00:30:20.574]  That's right.
[00:30:22.856 --> 00:30:23.757]  What comes next?
[00:30:23.797 --> 00:30:28.000]  We've got to do brain surgery before you can fly to make sure there's not a bomb inside your head?
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:28.780]  No, that's right.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.982]  If you need a colonoscopy, you don't need to go to the doctor.
[00:30:31.002 --> 00:30:32.203]  Just go through airport security.
[00:30:32.563 --> 00:30:33.083]  You know?
[00:30:33.443 --> 00:30:34.404]  They don't find the terrorist.
[00:30:34.444 --> 00:30:35.565]  They might get a couple of polyps.
[00:30:35.585 --> 00:30:36.305]  You know what I mean?
[00:30:36.345 --> 00:30:36.986]  It's ridiculous.
[00:30:37.366 --> 00:30:39.768]  So that's why we have to practice nonviolent resistance.
[00:30:39.828 --> 00:30:42.029]  I mean, there's a way to beat it.
[00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:44.291]  You know, there's a way to at least combat it, you know?
[00:30:45.152 --> 00:30:47.013]  At least, you know, here's the thing.
[00:30:47.193 --> 00:30:51.256]  The bottom line is, after I stood up for myself and they still
[00:30:52.096 --> 00:30:53.497]  You fought back against the rape.
[00:30:53.517 --> 00:30:56.020]  You didn't enjoy it.
[00:31:17.902 --> 00:31:18.362]  Exactly.
[00:31:18.503 --> 00:31:27.129]  I've found that when I argue with the TSA when they get out of control and put them in their place sternly, like I'm talking to my dog when it's been bad, that I then feel good.
[00:31:27.449 --> 00:31:28.610]  And they feel bad.
[00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:31.052]  But see, they're getting a good feeling off their evil.
[00:31:31.412 --> 00:31:37.256]  It's adding to the whole delusion that the terror threat is real and that it isn't staged.
[00:31:37.276 --> 00:31:44.141]  And for those that don't know, it's now been in the Detroit News, it's now been in other publications, in Congressional testimony.
[00:31:44.181 --> 00:31:45.202]  We even have the video, actually.
[00:31:45.222 --> 00:31:45.823]  We ought to play that.
[00:31:46.775 --> 00:31:53.943]  The deputy head of the State Department said we were ordered to let the underwear bomber on the plane and he was protected.
[00:31:54.264 --> 00:31:57.648]  And the FBI for two months lied about that and had to admit later they were covering up.
[00:31:58.028 --> 00:31:59.470]  I mean that whole thing was staged.
[00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:03.494]  In 7-7 it was a drill using government patsies who thought they were taking part in a drill.
[00:32:04.355 --> 00:32:11.539]  And, again, we're showing video right now off the mainstream news where they put their hands under women's breasts and go in circles.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:19.364]  And I've talked to, again, Paul Watson's girlfriend now of many years, and she says it's painful what they do in England.
[00:32:19.624 --> 00:32:21.105]  She says they actually squeeze.
[00:32:21.885 --> 00:32:22.485]  But why?
[00:32:22.565 --> 00:32:24.707]  But then, what if you said no?
[00:32:24.967 --> 00:32:25.887]  I won't do it.
[00:32:26.428 --> 00:32:28.449]  What if hundreds of people said no?
[00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:36.612]  Well, they are saying no, and then 30 civil rights groups have sent letters to TSA and Homeland Security.
[00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:46.135]  Look, it's not just that they're going to squeeze women's breasts and grab men's genitals and body scan the naked image of your children, your wife, your husband.
[00:32:46.775 --> 00:32:48.016]  They're going to take your pension funds.
[00:32:48.036 --> 00:32:49.217]  They're going to raise your taxes.
[00:32:49.237 --> 00:32:49.737]  They're doing it.
[00:32:49.877 --> 00:32:53.560]  I mean, this is a criminal group, and they're using psychology.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:33:05.988]  I mean, now, we told people a year and a half ago, I'm not bragging, it's sad, that Goldman Sachs premeditatedly engineered this whole thing with the other top six banks, and globally ten banks, and they know what they've done.
[00:33:07.569 --> 00:33:10.050]  They might get a slap on the wrist now for robbing everyone.
[00:33:11.151 --> 00:33:16.074]  We are obviously in the middle of a major, major shift.
[00:33:16.917 --> 00:33:24.603]  And if we can look at it in sort of a spiritual sense, that we are at the period of the rotting fruit right now.
[00:33:25.064 --> 00:33:30.668]  And the weight of the rotting fruit, it cannot stand on the tree, and it will eventually fall.
[00:33:31.008 --> 00:33:37.794]  And this is the nature and the actual physical energy of secrets and lies.
[00:33:38.414 --> 00:33:40.975]  They are finite and corporal like the body.
[00:33:41.115 --> 00:33:42.296]  Truth is infinite.
[00:33:42.676 --> 00:33:46.257]  But underneath the rotting fruit lies the golden seed.
[00:33:46.837 --> 00:34:01.143]  And if we can align ourselves with that seed and just try to just, you know, buckle up, Eddie, and just kind of take the ride of this shift right now, I think that we're going to come out in a golden age.
[00:34:01.783 --> 00:34:02.683]  I really believe that.
[00:34:02.803 --> 00:34:03.784]  And I think that's really
[00:34:04.724 --> 00:34:14.869]  The idea of standing in truth, not being afraid of yourself, being a spiritual warrior, not being afraid to speak the truth, and not being afraid of yourself.
[00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:16.870]  That's another thing.
[00:34:17.231 --> 00:34:19.632]  When we give away our power, we think that we're worthless.
[00:34:20.212 --> 00:34:22.874]  But it's not the darkness that we're afraid of, it's the light.
[00:34:23.194 --> 00:34:27.736]  It's the power of who we are in our being created in divinity.
[00:34:28.657 --> 00:34:30.517]  And that's what we need to just pay attention to.
[00:34:30.538 --> 00:34:33.159]  And stand in alignment with that.
[00:34:33.695 --> 00:34:34.595]  Extremely heavy.
[00:34:35.476 --> 00:34:37.436]  Absolutely veritas.
[00:34:38.397 --> 00:34:40.657]  What you've said is the truth, Christina Ebersole.
[00:34:41.338 --> 00:34:43.678]  And who was it, Martin Luther King, that you like to quote?
[00:34:44.299 --> 00:34:50.421]  That the moral arc of the universe is long, but it bends toward justice.
[00:34:51.061 --> 00:34:54.822]  So when we stand in truth, we have the support of the universe.
[00:34:55.882 --> 00:34:57.283]  And that's what this shift is about.
[00:34:57.303 --> 00:34:58.963]  It's a shift in consciousness.
[00:34:59.503 --> 00:35:00.864]  And people are waking up.
[00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:07.413]  And waking up and being able to see, like the Matrix, through the false paradigm, through the lies.
[00:35:07.873 --> 00:35:12.335]  And now it's becoming, it's happening at such rapid speed, and now it's becoming so transparent.
[00:35:12.695 --> 00:35:17.498]  The desperate act of those SWAT team coming after me would just show their desperation.
[00:35:18.218 --> 00:35:19.418]  It said nothing about me.
[00:35:19.438 --> 00:35:21.439]  It showed everything about this girl.
[00:35:21.459 --> 00:35:24.800]  Well, we better go get her, you know, and hold on to this.
[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:26.240]  Yeah, it's not about terrorism.
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:27.520]  It's about domination.
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:30.321]  It's about letting you know, hey, we're the boss.
[00:35:30.881 --> 00:35:32.361]  And guess what?
[00:35:32.481 --> 00:35:35.222]  It's as simple as the click of the heels, folks.
[00:35:35.502 --> 00:35:36.642]  Click of those little heels.
[00:35:36.682 --> 00:35:40.383]  You didn't know that you could get home to who you are that quickly.
[00:35:41.167 --> 00:35:44.130]  You know, because we're in Oz right now, and it's a horse of a different color.
[00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:47.893]  But you don't forget you got the Ruby Slippers on.
[00:35:48.693 --> 00:35:51.216]  And all you do is click them, and you return to yourself.
[00:35:51.636 --> 00:35:54.498]  And that's the most powerful thing we have.
[00:35:55.499 --> 00:35:56.980]  Well, what is the movie Ants?
[00:35:59.322 --> 00:36:03.526]  The cartoon, the animated... Yeah, that's a great one.
[00:36:05.236 --> 00:36:15.985]  And you've got the grasshoppers all sitting around there in a grain bin, plenty of food, and one of the, uh, the aide-de-camp to the head evil grasshopper comes over and says, we got plenty of food here.
[00:36:16.305 --> 00:36:18.226]  Why are we dominating and fighting with these ants?
[00:36:18.787 --> 00:36:25.532]  And he goes, those little puny ants outnumber us a hundred to one, and if they ever figure that out, it's over for us.
[00:36:25.552 --> 00:36:26.793]  That's right.
[00:36:28.555 --> 00:36:30.096]  And I think we're starting to figure it out.
[00:36:31.078 --> 00:36:34.000]  That's why it looks, that's why everything is just so transparent.
[00:36:34.641 --> 00:36:37.123]  Everywhere you turn, it's like, oh my god, what a lie!
[00:36:37.223 --> 00:36:38.905]  Oh my god, that's such an obvious lie!
[00:36:38.925 --> 00:36:40.606]  You know?
[00:36:41.126 --> 00:36:48.032]  And that's why 9-11, as the years go by, people are starting to wake up to like, wait a minute, it's the Santa Claus conspiracy!
[00:36:48.492 --> 00:36:56.239]  A big fat guy can't sit down at Little Pipe, you know, and put two thousand pounds spread on your roof with eight reindeer, the roof will collapse!
[00:36:57.617 --> 00:36:59.799]  And he can't get to China and to your room.
[00:36:59.839 --> 00:37:01.200]  You see, that's the perfect metaphor.
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:04.322]  If you're asleep, you know, he sees you when you're sleeping.
[00:37:04.342 --> 00:37:05.182]  He knows when you're awake.
[00:37:05.202 --> 00:37:06.463]  He knows if you've been bad or good.
[00:37:06.804 --> 00:37:08.885]  So go to sleep, otherwise you don't get the presents.
[00:37:09.205 --> 00:37:15.550]  You know, meanwhile, if you're awake, perfect metaphor, you see that mom and dad are arguing over the, you know, the bicycle they can't put together for you.
[00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:17.071]  So that's the thing.
[00:37:17.111 --> 00:37:19.953]  You just, you know, it's the Santa Claus conspiracy.
[00:37:20.742 --> 00:37:29.211]  Well, you know, I've got great parents, and they never instilled fairy tales in me, but when I was about three, it's one of my earliest really clear memories.
[00:37:29.612 --> 00:37:40.644]  There was the chimney in our little house on San Fernando Way in Dallas, Texas, and it had the red bricks with the little spaces in between under the mortar.
[00:37:41.525 --> 00:37:45.787]  And they were explaining Santa Claus comes down to the chimney, like in between these bricks.
[00:37:46.227 --> 00:37:50.969]  I remember being three years old and saying, but he's big and fat, this chimney's little bitty.
[00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:54.311]  Because it was a small house, there's no way he's coming down this.
[00:37:55.111 --> 00:37:59.253]  And my dad said, yeah, it's just fine, it's not really true.
[00:37:59.873 --> 00:38:04.295]  But it's just like they were on the news saying we're going to blow up Building 7.
[00:38:04.355 --> 00:38:06.056]  Then they blew it up.
[00:38:06.376 --> 00:38:08.317]  Then they said, you never saw that on the news.
[00:38:09.868 --> 00:38:11.531]  I mean, it's laughably tragic.
[00:38:11.711 --> 00:38:12.953]  It's really unbelievable.
[00:38:13.434 --> 00:38:14.756]  It's really unbelievable.
[00:38:14.996 --> 00:38:18.882]  The whole thing about 9-11, all you have to know is that 2 plus 2 is 4.
[00:38:19.784 --> 00:38:20.585]  That's all you have to know.
[00:38:21.286 --> 00:38:23.770]  But buildings cannot fall in 10 seconds.
[00:38:31.711 --> 00:38:39.298]  Well they blow all three of them up in front of everybody and then that day they're saying we're blowing it up there's cops saying get back we're blowing it up and
[00:38:40.754 --> 00:38:42.575]  And again, that's the mind control, the matrix.
[00:38:42.595 --> 00:38:43.896]  Those cops weren't involved in it.
[00:38:44.336 --> 00:38:46.597]  They were just told, and we've talked to the cops, it was a countdown.
[00:38:47.017 --> 00:38:49.178]  They were told for two hours before, we're going to blow it up.
[00:38:49.239 --> 00:38:53.621]  The cops went, you know, they didn't think, well, how do you wire a building when it's on fire?
[00:38:53.661 --> 00:38:55.002]  It takes weeks to do this right.
[00:38:55.362 --> 00:38:56.482]  And then they blew it up perfectly.
[00:38:56.502 --> 00:38:58.463]  And the cops were like, get back, they're blowing it up.
[00:38:58.904 --> 00:39:00.885]  And then Silverstein comes out and says, we blew it up.
[00:39:01.165 --> 00:39:02.465]  People say, well, how did you blow it up?
[00:39:02.505 --> 00:39:03.686]  He says, well, I didn't mean that.
[00:39:04.206 --> 00:39:08.789]  And then we have a Fox News reporter go, yeah, no, Silverstein was talking about blowing it up that day.
[00:39:09.289 --> 00:39:14.230]  But that, they supposedly debunk us by admitting they were talking about blowing it up.
[00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:16.111]  But that they didn't blow it up, Christine.
[00:39:16.131 --> 00:39:17.231]  Yeah, of course not.
[00:39:17.251 --> 00:39:18.691]  I mean, this is what's so crazy.
[00:39:18.831 --> 00:39:20.832]  Of course they're gonna say that, you know?
[00:39:20.892 --> 00:39:27.474]  Well, that's why they're freaking out, because... Yeah, exactly, because they can't, they can't, it's on shifting sands.
[00:39:28.014 --> 00:39:30.374]  You see, the rock of truth, it's built on a rock.
[00:39:30.814 --> 00:39:31.915]  And it never changes.
[00:39:31.935 --> 00:39:34.635]  Two plus two is always four.
[00:39:35.516 --> 00:39:36.756]  It's never, ooh, maybe five.
[00:39:37.432 --> 00:39:38.633]  I mean, that's the perfect story.
[00:39:38.653 --> 00:39:40.513]  You know, did you ever watch the movie 1984?
[00:39:40.553 --> 00:39:41.153]  Oh, yes.
[00:39:41.434 --> 00:39:48.076]  Yeah, so you remember, like, when John Heard is in the Ministry of Love, which is a torture chamber, and Richard Burton's holding up four fingers?
[00:39:48.116 --> 00:39:49.377]  He says, how many fingers am I holding up?
[00:39:49.437 --> 00:39:51.037]  He says four, and he gets tortured.
[00:39:51.457 --> 00:39:52.958]  The camera goes back, it comes back up.
[00:39:53.378 --> 00:39:54.739]  He says, he holds up four fingers.
[00:39:54.779 --> 00:39:56.079]  He says, how many fingers am I holding up?
[00:39:56.099 --> 00:39:56.959]  He says, I don't know.
[00:39:57.019 --> 00:39:58.080]  He says, that's better.
[00:40:00.081 --> 00:40:01.361]  And that's the whole thing.
[00:40:01.521 --> 00:40:02.542]  They just want to wear you down.
[00:40:02.622 --> 00:40:06.023]  If you're terrified and tortured, then you just don't want to be killed.
[00:40:06.986 --> 00:40:08.527]  You know, and that's what happened on that day.
[00:40:08.607 --> 00:40:10.489]  It was a shock and awe of 9-11.
[00:40:10.569 --> 00:40:12.170]  Everyone stared to death.
[00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:13.992]  It's just, you know, I do believe in spooks.
[00:40:14.132 --> 00:40:15.153]  I do, I do, I do.
[00:40:15.173 --> 00:40:17.175]  Just don't kill me, you know what I mean?
[00:40:17.255 --> 00:40:18.536]  And here's the biggest tell.
[00:40:18.716 --> 00:40:24.901]  Not just all the evidence and the drills and the Northwoods and the PNAC documents and the hijackers trained at U.S.
[00:40:24.941 --> 00:40:29.025]  bases on and on and on forever and the lies about WMDs.
[00:40:30.356 --> 00:40:34.198]  The biggest issue is within about 15-20 minutes, I'm watching the channels live.
[00:40:34.618 --> 00:40:40.081]  I'm in the shower, my wife, girlfriend at the time, wife now, comes and says, get out, get out, something's happened.
[00:40:40.701 --> 00:40:45.624]  And I come out, and I'm sitting there toweling off, and one tower's been hit.
[00:40:47.096 --> 00:40:48.377]  And I said, this is terrorism.
[00:40:48.397 --> 00:40:50.299]  And she said, no, it's probably just a plane.
[00:40:50.319 --> 00:40:51.180]  And I said, no, you watch.
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.061]  It's going to be terrorism.
[00:40:52.301 --> 00:40:53.302]  Then another one hits.
[00:40:54.323 --> 00:40:59.788]  And then by the time the second one hit, they were on every channel.
[00:40:59.948 --> 00:41:03.772]  I had two TVs on, one in each room, flipping back and forth.
[00:41:04.272 --> 00:41:05.572]  And they were all saying the same thing.
[00:41:05.652 --> 00:41:06.473]  It's a new world order.
[00:41:06.493 --> 00:41:07.833]  You're going to have to give your rights up.
[00:41:08.053 --> 00:41:09.593]  We're going to have to attack Iraq.
[00:41:09.613 --> 00:41:11.274]  And it was all the same script.
[00:41:11.774 --> 00:41:13.614]  And if you're in the media, you understand the script.
[00:41:13.634 --> 00:41:14.494]  I mean, you're an actress.
[00:41:14.514 --> 00:41:15.395]  You understand a script.
[00:41:15.935 --> 00:41:17.715]  And you can do the same play in L.A.
[00:41:17.735 --> 00:41:24.217]  that you can do in San Francisco or you can do in New York City on Broadway.
[00:41:24.337 --> 00:41:25.397]  And you know the script.
[00:41:25.417 --> 00:41:26.757]  You're like, oh, that's Othello.
[00:41:27.477 --> 00:41:29.258]  Or that's Romeo and Juliet.
[00:41:30.378 --> 00:41:33.419]  Uh, or, you know, that's, uh, whatever play it is.
[00:41:33.439 --> 00:41:35.220]  I mean, I'm watching them reading scripts.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:36.600]  Yeah.
[00:41:37.521 --> 00:41:41.062]  Well, what about when they told too early that Welding 7 was coming down?
[00:41:42.263 --> 00:41:44.763]  They said it at 5 o'clock, and it didn't come down till 5.25.
[00:41:45.124 --> 00:41:48.165]  No, exactly, and it was an exact script on three different networks.
[00:41:48.205 --> 00:41:48.385]  Whoops!
[00:41:48.425 --> 00:41:49.745]  A little early!
[00:41:49.765 --> 00:41:52.926]  I mean, it's so transparent.
[00:41:53.027 --> 00:41:54.267]  You see, that's the way lies are.
[00:41:54.287 --> 00:41:56.868]  You have to keep changing the story in order to keep it going.
[00:41:57.802 --> 00:41:59.386]  You know, with the truth, you just have to tell it once.
[00:41:59.607 --> 00:42:00.429]  It's so much easier.
[00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:06.865]  Well, Mark Twain said, if you tell the truth, you never have to remember anything.
[00:42:08.226 --> 00:42:09.907]  And that's what's so easy about my job.
[00:42:10.307 --> 00:42:15.750]  I mean, sometimes I get facts and figures and numbers backwards, but it's rare.
[00:42:16.431 --> 00:42:22.134]  In a four-hour show, maybe once a day, I'll listen back to the show, and I'll hear something isn't exactly right, and I'll come back and correct it.
[00:42:22.194 --> 00:42:31.759]  But these guys are... I mean, it's like Fox News saying there was never a plan to blow up Building 7, and then now one of their senior people goes, okay, we were there, they were talking about blowing it up.
[00:42:32.768 --> 00:42:33.969]  And it's just incredible.
[00:42:33.989 --> 00:42:36.010]  Christine Ebersole, thank you for standing up.
[00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:43.194]  Thank you for empowering people through the suppression, through this brainwashing, for breaking the spell and helping others break the spell.
[00:42:43.654 --> 00:42:44.615]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[00:42:44.635 --> 00:42:45.415]  It was great talking to you.
[00:42:45.435 --> 00:42:46.476]  And I'll say bye to you during the break.
[00:42:46.676 --> 00:42:47.696]  And thanks for everything you do.
[00:42:48.337 --> 00:42:48.717]  Thank you.
[00:42:48.757 --> 00:42:49.797]  We appreciate you, Christine.
[00:42:50.138 --> 00:42:54.860]  Christine Ebersole, standing up against the New World Order and helping others break out of the matrix.
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.982]  We'll be right back with the good news on climate change.
[00:42:59.983 --> 00:43:03.007]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:43:03.367 --> 00:43:06.971]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:43:07.271 --> 00:43:10.735]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?

[00:43:59.959 --> 00:44:02.239]  They helped to create a new world order.
[00:44:02.259 --> 00:44:04.560]  We are part of a new world order.
[00:44:04.661 --> 00:44:07.562]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[00:44:07.862 --> 00:44:12.624]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:44:12.964 --> 00:44:17.166]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:44:17.466 --> 00:44:19.829]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:44:19.929 --> 00:44:22.353]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:44:22.713 --> 00:44:25.276]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:44:25.617 --> 00:44:33.227]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:44:33.547 --> 00:44:38.812]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:44:38.952 --> 00:44:41.754]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:44:41.814 --> 00:44:45.237]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:44:45.477 --> 00:44:46.398]  And I got news for you.
[00:44:46.558 --> 00:44:47.859]  You're everyone else.
[00:44:47.899 --> 00:44:49.000]  Invisible Empire.

[00:45:03.182 --> 00:45:05.304]  Let's talk about down-home value.
[00:45:05.584 --> 00:45:08.105]  Made in the USA, blue jeans.
[00:45:08.506 --> 00:45:10.187]  Like you wore as a kid.
[00:45:10.527 --> 00:45:10.967]  Remember?
[00:45:11.408 --> 00:45:13.809]  There's a place down in Tennessee.
[00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:18.172]  Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:45:20.054 --> 00:45:22.375]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:45:24.096 --> 00:45:26.418]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:45:28.328 --> 00:45:32.311]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:45:33.012 --> 00:45:35.954]  Blue diamond gusset's got it.
[00:45:37.216 --> 00:45:40.677]  For good old-fashioned comfort, get Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:45:40.977 --> 00:45:42.258]  Every stitch guaranteed.
[00:45:42.458 --> 00:45:45.478]  In our Defender Motorcycle Jeans comes Kevlar reinforced.
[00:45:45.719 --> 00:45:46.539]  See them at gusset.com.

[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:49.820]  Others don't.
[00:46:01.781 --> 00:46:06.445]  Okay, Judge Andrew Napolitano is on in the last 30 minutes of the next hour on key issues.
[00:46:06.465 --> 00:46:08.046]  I want to congratulate him.
[00:46:08.867 --> 00:46:10.808]  I can find nothing wrong with this guy.
[00:46:11.429 --> 00:46:15.812]  I wish I could say that about everybody at Fox, but we're just really excited to have this constitutionalist on with us.
[00:46:16.152 --> 00:46:17.353]  Congratulations to him.
[00:46:17.753 --> 00:46:24.178]  He is getting, I knew about this months ago, but couldn't talk about it, he is getting the show on the Fox Business Network that goes out worldwide.
[00:46:24.959 --> 00:46:25.600]  So not just a
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:31.223]  Contributor to Fox TV, but now his own TV show destined to be very successful.
[00:46:31.883 --> 00:46:33.424]  And so we're excited about that.
[00:46:33.464 --> 00:46:34.264]  We've got him coming up.
[00:46:34.324 --> 00:46:36.586]  I want to go to Tim, Tim, Jason, Tim.
[00:46:37.286 --> 00:46:39.127]  Sometimes you just get a bunch of the same name.
[00:46:39.547 --> 00:46:42.109]  Mark and others that are patiently holding.
[00:46:42.149 --> 00:46:43.489]  In fact, I'm just going to go to your calls now.
[00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:50.854]  And then when we eight after second segment, the next hour, I'm going to get into the Copenhagen falling apart completely.
[00:46:50.874 --> 00:46:54.576]  I mean, this this news is so good, so wonderful.
[00:46:55.376 --> 00:46:56.417]  We're going to be talking about it.
[00:46:57.157 --> 00:46:59.078]  Right now, let's go to Tim in Nevada.
[00:46:59.118 --> 00:46:59.898]  Tim, you're on the air.
[00:47:00.999 --> 00:47:02.139]  Hey, how are you guys doing?
[00:47:02.219 --> 00:47:03.860]  It's good to be back in the United States.
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:05.881]  I call your show quite a bit from South America.
[00:47:07.722 --> 00:47:09.743]  I'm touring in the United States on a wrestling tour.
[00:47:09.763 --> 00:47:16.366]  I had to come through Washington, D.C., and I had a similar experience to my fellow performer there.
[00:47:18.867 --> 00:47:24.570]  I can't believe when I was listening to what she went through, it sounded like a typical criminal molestation.
[00:47:25.245 --> 00:47:36.433]  I mean, I couldn't believe what they put her through, but they made me take my championship belt out of my bag because they said it was blocking the view of my carry-on.
[00:47:37.534 --> 00:47:38.395]  So that was embarrassing.
[00:47:38.415 --> 00:47:40.176]  I had to take my belt out in front of everybody.
[00:47:41.157 --> 00:47:44.919]  And then after that, I did everything they told me to do, going through the scanners.
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:53.786]  And then they wanted me to go into the full-body scanner at the Customs after I scanned my passport, scanned my visa, everything from Brazil.
[00:47:54.838 --> 00:47:56.940]  They wanted to get your biometric body scan.
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:57.680]  What happened next?
[00:47:58.281 --> 00:47:59.642]  Well, I refused.
[00:47:59.822 --> 00:48:01.723]  I told them I was afraid of the radiation.
[00:48:03.024 --> 00:48:03.965]  I didn't want to go through it.
[00:48:04.105 --> 00:48:08.048]  I told them I felt that it was against my Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights.
[00:48:09.048 --> 00:48:13.892]  And that I did have a lawyer and that if they wanted to give me a problem, I said take a look at my belt.
[00:48:13.972 --> 00:48:15.053]  I'm not a nobody.
[00:48:15.093 --> 00:48:16.013]  I do have lawyers.
[00:48:16.354 --> 00:48:17.054]  And so what happened?
[00:48:17.935 --> 00:48:23.739]  Well, they basically asked me to step over behind... It wasn't a room, but it was like a glass
[00:48:24.494 --> 00:48:24.794]  I don't know.
[00:48:24.814 --> 00:48:28.616]  It looked like one of the cubicles, but it was see-through glass.
[00:48:29.757 --> 00:48:32.779]  And they basically wanted me down, and then they wanted to pat me down.
[00:48:33.079 --> 00:48:35.280]  And I said, you know, I'm not a criminal.
[00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:36.781]  I'm not being suspected of anything.
[00:48:37.902 --> 00:48:39.303]  You have checked my bags.
[00:48:39.363 --> 00:48:41.324]  I've been very, very cooperative.
[00:48:42.044 --> 00:48:43.285]  You have no right to do this to me.
[00:48:43.645 --> 00:48:46.086]  I don't want you touching me.
[00:48:46.106 --> 00:48:49.609]  I then reiterated again that I do have legal representation.
[00:48:49.649 --> 00:48:50.309]  And then what happened?
[00:48:50.956 --> 00:48:58.238]  Well, they basically told me that I was allowed to go, but then the TSA security, he looked like a kid younger than me.
[00:48:58.298 --> 00:49:01.840]  He was at least 21 years old.
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:04.860]  He took my suitcase and he threw it on the ground and broke it.
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:06.121]  It was a 70-pound suitcase.
[00:49:06.141 --> 00:49:08.762]  I had my laptop and all my belongings in it.
[00:49:09.062 --> 00:49:10.722]  So now they smash your goods.
[00:49:11.122 --> 00:49:11.423]  Yeah.
[00:49:12.063 --> 00:49:18.805]  And I tried to report it to a supervisor, and the supervisor, you know, I love it when they try to say, sir, sir, sir, like they're being polite.
[00:49:19.813 --> 00:49:25.336]  But what they're really trying to do is just be, you know, like a polite way of saying, uh, you're going to do whatever we want.
[00:49:25.576 --> 00:49:25.956]  Period.
[00:49:27.217 --> 00:49:28.278]  Or don't get excited, sir.
[00:49:28.298 --> 00:49:29.899]  Don't get excited as they get in your face.
[00:49:30.219 --> 00:49:30.659]  Exactly.
[00:49:30.699 --> 00:49:34.481]  And then they tried, uh, you know, I'm in my, my prime right now as a professional wrestler.
[00:49:34.541 --> 00:49:40.405]  And, uh, as, as the great Jesse, the body Ventura, I'm a pretty big guy myself.
[00:49:40.485 --> 00:49:46.288]  So they try to, they tend to try to flip the card on you and they try to pick on you and make you seem like,
[00:49:47.032 --> 00:49:50.234]  Um, you're a violent person for sticking up for yourself because you're a big person.
[00:49:50.914 --> 00:49:52.055]  You're bigger than everybody else.
[00:49:52.155 --> 00:49:54.116]  Also, they said, oh, you're a big tough guy.
[00:49:54.216 --> 00:49:54.976]  Oh, you're big.
[00:49:54.996 --> 00:49:55.456]  Exactly.
[00:49:55.496 --> 00:49:56.917]  And then, oh, you're picking on us.
[00:49:56.937 --> 00:49:59.598]  You're picking on, oh, this big guy's giving us problems.
[00:49:59.618 --> 00:50:01.219]  And then they call the other people over.
[00:50:01.239 --> 00:50:06.962]  I said, look, you have no right to pick my personal belongings up off the belt and then throw it on the ground.
[00:50:07.402 --> 00:50:11.564]  He broke the, uh, the handle that folds out.
[00:50:12.305 --> 00:50:14.606]  And it totally broke off the suitcase from the scene.
[00:50:14.926 --> 00:50:15.907]  And I was pissed off.
[00:50:15.987 --> 00:50:16.407]  I was like,
[00:50:17.287 --> 00:50:18.107]  You know, what the heck?
[00:50:18.147 --> 00:50:19.188]  We only got 20 seconds.
[00:50:19.388 --> 00:50:19.928]  How did it end?
[00:50:20.569 --> 00:50:25.551]  Well, I got away with just, you know, basically telling the boss off and I didn't get a SWAT team after me.
[00:50:25.591 --> 00:50:26.152]  Thank God.
[00:50:26.672 --> 00:50:27.172]  All right, buddy.
[00:50:27.192 --> 00:50:28.253]  I appreciate your call.
[00:50:28.273 --> 00:50:31.234]  We're going to come back with more calls on the other side.
[00:50:31.254 --> 00:50:36.617]  Then what's happening with the globalist fake environmental takeover falling apart at every level?
[00:50:36.837 --> 00:50:37.998]  We have a chance to destroy it.

[00:51:54.974 --> 00:51:57.757]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:05.242 --> 00:52:06.702]  Man, this show went by fast.
[00:52:07.002 --> 00:52:09.103]  It is the fourth hour, the final hour.
[00:52:09.183 --> 00:52:12.243]  Judge Andrew Napolitano coming up in T-minus 30 minutes.
[00:52:12.263 --> 00:52:13.924]  We're taking your phone calls right now.
[00:52:13.944 --> 00:52:16.184]  I'm going to go over a whole bunch of important news.
[00:52:16.644 --> 00:52:28.827]  Texas is now, we have lawmakers now calling for the Arizona-style law, saying if they run into illegals during regular traffic stops for drunk driving or whatever the case may be, and you're here illegally, they're going to charge you with that as well.
[00:52:28.847 --> 00:52:30.507]  They're going to bring you to the feds.
[00:52:31.107 --> 00:52:34.271]  That the media is spinning it like it's going to be checkpoints in Nazi Germany.
[00:52:34.951 --> 00:52:38.516]  No, that's for citizens with the blood-taking checkpoints and the body scanners.
[00:52:39.136 --> 00:52:43.381]  The illegals, and I've seen it and it's been on the news, they're allowed on the airplanes without any IDs.
[00:52:44.202 --> 00:52:46.965]  Okay, see, I want the rights they got.
[00:52:46.985 --> 00:52:48.807]  I want to be left alone like they are.
[00:52:49.608 --> 00:52:50.649]  Get right down to it.
[00:52:50.909 --> 00:52:51.389]  I'm a U.S.
[00:52:51.429 --> 00:52:51.809]  citizen.
[00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:53.270]  That doesn't mean I'm total trash here.
[00:52:53.310 --> 00:52:53.630]  Come on.
[00:52:54.231 --> 00:52:56.452]  But we're taking your phone calls right now.
[00:52:56.752 --> 00:52:58.553]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tim.
[00:52:59.034 --> 00:53:00.314]  Tim in Georgia.
[00:53:00.374 --> 00:53:01.155]  Tim, you're on the air.
[00:53:02.215 --> 00:53:02.736]  Hey, Alex.
[00:53:02.816 --> 00:53:14.502]  I just wanted to tell you what a great witness you gave the other day when you had the degenerate atheist comedian guy on, and to hear the contrast between your approach to life versus his.
[00:53:16.504 --> 00:53:28.130]  It really meant something when you heard it, and you could just see the difference in what it means to have a purposeful, meaningful life, and to just be dilly-dallying around and say, oh, I'm just having a great time, and blah, blah, blah.
[00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:32.432]  Well, I mean, Doug Stanhope, I don't think is a bad person, and he's a talented guy at certain levels.
[00:53:33.072 --> 00:53:35.214]  But it's, you know, just look at the bad in the world.
[00:53:35.254 --> 00:53:37.796]  Some people accuse me of being negative because I'm pointing out the bad.
[00:53:37.856 --> 00:53:48.243]  No, I'm going after the bad to protect this wonderland we live in of beauty and this creation and hundreds of billions of galaxies spinning around us.
[00:53:48.263 --> 00:53:49.905]  I mean, it's every moment.
[00:53:50.365 --> 00:53:50.726]  Yeah, and just...
[00:54:12.478 --> 00:54:14.520]  But it matters to hear the difference.
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:30.154]  To have you and him talking at the same time and to be able to actively compare the difference between two people with entirely different views on life was very nice to hear and it was uplifting to hear that
[00:54:32.606 --> 00:54:36.509]  You can just see the difference, the contrast, it was just amazing to see.
[00:54:54.107 --> 00:54:55.828]  But that's really the spirit of the world.
[00:54:55.848 --> 00:55:00.831]  I mean, the attitude he has about everything is just so sad.
[00:55:00.851 --> 00:55:08.875]  And even if you don't believe in God or a creator of the universe, I mean, who made the hundreds of billions of galaxies that Hubble has photographed?
[00:55:08.955 --> 00:55:12.137]  Hundreds of billions, with each galaxy having
[00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:28.476]  Between tens of millions of stars, tens of billions and tens of trillions, they're all different sizes and combinations, and to look at those giant gas clouds forming billions of stars, you know, inside galaxies, and to see black holes, and what is it?
[00:55:28.536 --> 00:55:29.216]  Where does it go?
[00:55:29.316 --> 00:55:30.037]  Where does it end?
[00:55:30.057 --> 00:55:31.257]  You know, what made it?
[00:55:31.897 --> 00:55:34.218]  I mean, what is reality?
[00:55:34.258 --> 00:55:34.899]  I mean, it's so...
[00:55:35.979 --> 00:55:40.463]  Unbelievable to be able to just to be conscious and to have this gift.
[00:55:40.483 --> 00:55:42.745]  It makes me want to fall flat on my face to the Creator.
[00:55:43.085 --> 00:55:44.166]  I can feel the Creator.
[00:55:44.186 --> 00:55:45.247]  I can feel it in the universe.
[00:55:45.367 --> 00:55:46.668]  I know what good and evil is.
[00:55:47.489 --> 00:55:52.773]  And I just can't imagine people that just think humanity is a bunch of trash.
[00:55:52.993 --> 00:55:53.874]  That's what the elite think.
[00:55:53.894 --> 00:55:56.496]  They think we're all a bunch of trash and they want to kill us.
[00:55:56.556 --> 00:55:57.918]  And I'm just, I'm not for it.
[00:55:57.978 --> 00:55:59.319]  I mean, and then I'm the bad guy.
[00:56:00.578 --> 00:56:01.418]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:56:01.458 --> 00:56:08.302]  Like, to hear that attitude, you just hear the elite working through individuals like that.
[00:56:08.622 --> 00:56:11.263]  Just like, it's coming out of their eyes and their mouths.
[00:56:12.043 --> 00:56:15.665]  Like the puppet master just saying, here say this, here say that, here say this.
[00:56:16.045 --> 00:56:18.287]  And it'll spread, and it's an easy sell.
[00:56:19.008 --> 00:56:20.489]  They sap our life force.
[00:56:20.529 --> 00:56:22.010]  They sap our will to resist.
[00:56:22.290 --> 00:56:23.591]  They sap our will to live.
[00:56:23.631 --> 00:56:25.293]  They sap our will to procreate.
[00:56:25.573 --> 00:56:27.194]  They sap our humanity.
[00:56:27.935 --> 00:56:37.523]  Being humans means you love, you fight, you stand up against evil, you have children, you struggle to raise them right, you struggle to keep them from falling to the world.
[00:56:37.703 --> 00:56:39.224]  That's what makes us strong.
[00:56:39.584 --> 00:56:43.468]  And the moment you just jellyfish out and roll over like a dead whale,
[00:56:44.348 --> 00:56:45.409]  It is just sickening.
[00:56:45.449 --> 00:56:46.530]  I appreciate your call, Tim.
[00:56:46.811 --> 00:56:48.612]  More calls straight ahead and a ton of news.

[00:56:58.721 --> 00:57:00.043]  Humanity is strong!
[00:57:00.283 --> 00:57:02.385]  Max, what did you do with the remote?
[00:57:03.194 --> 00:57:04.195]  Now what am I going to do?
[00:57:04.615 --> 00:57:06.356]  I guess I can go online to find a new one.
[00:57:06.776 --> 00:57:07.116]  Okay.

[00:57:17.681 --> 00:57:18.061]  Wow!

[00:58:00.083 --> 00:58:02.686]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:03.107 --> 00:58:08.053]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:58:08.434 --> 00:58:10.176]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:58:10.476 --> 00:58:15.302]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:58:15.482 --> 00:58:16.444]  How much do you want?
[00:58:16.664 --> 00:58:17.405]  When do you want it?
[00:58:17.765 --> 00:58:19.386]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:58:19.666 --> 00:58:20.487]  When will you need it?
[00:58:20.727 --> 00:58:22.789]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:58:22.929 --> 00:58:24.030]  Will there be any food?
[00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:25.611]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:58:25.791 --> 00:58:30.874]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:58:31.075 --> 00:58:34.197]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:58:34.637 --> 00:58:38.138]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:58:38.458 --> 00:58:39.439]  How much will you need?
[00:58:39.679 --> 00:58:40.319]  We don't know.
[00:58:40.599 --> 00:58:41.500]  How much do you want?
[00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:42.420]  All you can get.
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:43.480]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:46.481]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:58:46.782 --> 00:58:48.522]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:58:48.562 --> 00:58:49.463]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:58:59.212 --> 00:59:00.472]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:59:00.512 --> 00:59:05.854]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:59:06.094 --> 00:59:10.716]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:59:11.116 --> 00:59:11.516]  It's true.
[00:59:11.596 --> 00:59:16.138]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:59:16.678 --> 00:59:21.381]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:59:21.902 --> 00:59:23.843]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:59:24.223 --> 00:59:28.826]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:59:29.026 --> 00:59:29.927]  And here's the best part.
[00:59:30.147 --> 00:59:32.909]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:59:33.209 --> 00:59:36.511]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:59:36.832 --> 00:59:39.673]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:59:40.034 --> 00:59:41.915]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:59:42.255 --> 00:59:43.176]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:59:46.898 --> 00:59:49.920]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:59:51.041 --> 00:59:55.564]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:59:55.864 --> 00:59:58.326]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:00:04.790 --> 01:00:05.391]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.096 --> 01:00:07.137]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.857 --> 01:00:08.958]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.619 --> 01:00:10.439]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:12.120]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.761 --> 01:00:16.563]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.944 --> 01:00:21.026]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.882 --> 01:00:35.604]  Alright, we are now into the fourth and final hour, second segment here.
[01:00:35.964 --> 01:00:40.226]  Judge Andrew Napolitano coming up in about T-minus 25 minutes.
[01:00:41.427 --> 01:00:49.910]  I want to run over some news and we're going to go right back to your phone calls, those of you that are patiently holding, Jason, Tim, Mark, Quentin, Tony and others.
[01:00:49.930 --> 01:00:52.531]  We should at least get to those calls before our guest joins us.
[01:00:53.152 --> 01:00:53.372]  Okay.
[01:00:55.687 --> 01:01:13.001]  Schwarzenegger is a top globalist and he was at Copenhagen and it was a two-week summit back in December, openly calling for world government, all the world leaders, all over the news, hundreds of articles a day saying planetary government, taxes paid to a world government run by banks,
[01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:18.535]  At the top of that are JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, criminals, at the top.
[01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:21.398]  It doesn't mean all their employees, but the system committing all these crimes.
[01:01:22.239 --> 01:01:26.164]  And they said, we're going to pay all these taxes and value-added taxes and VAT.
[01:01:26.484 --> 01:01:28.907]  Financial taxes will be paid to the IMF World Bank.
[01:01:29.888 --> 01:01:30.989]  That has gotten in a lot of trouble.
[01:01:31.049 --> 01:01:34.573]  So now they're calling it world financial reform, the exact same taxes.
[01:01:35.535 --> 01:01:39.261]  And they'll come back with some new reason, you know, an anti-terror tax, a security tax.
[01:01:39.983 --> 01:01:47.054]  But it's the same system, global governance, and that's been called for all week long by Obama, by Gordon Brown, and by others.
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:02:00.747]  But the good news is, some of the biggest stalwarts supporting this, Germany, France, Australia, and others, in the last week, have completely pulled out of it.
[01:02:01.187 --> 01:02:08.271]  And I'm reading what Sarkozy said, because in a parliamentary election he almost lost control of the country.
[01:02:09.271 --> 01:02:10.812]  Merkel's in trouble because of this.
[01:02:11.892 --> 01:02:14.173]  The Prime Minister of Australia is in trouble.
[01:02:14.633 --> 01:02:18.554]  And they're saying, in a concerted effort, okay, it's off the table for at least three years.
[01:02:19.174 --> 01:02:29.917]  Now, they're waiting for our movement to expose them as criminals, bringing in this carbon tax to control our entire economy and shut down our industrial base.
[01:02:30.157 --> 01:02:31.718]  And that's the UN's own statements.
[01:02:32.338 --> 01:02:35.419]  Quote, destroy an industrial society so they can control us.
[01:02:36.772 --> 01:02:38.954]  But here is Der Spiegel today.
[01:02:39.654 --> 01:02:40.775]  Copenhagen fallout.
[01:02:40.855 --> 01:02:43.677]  Merkel abandons aim of binding climate agreement.
[01:02:44.598 --> 01:02:52.704]  Frustrated by the climate change conference in December, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is quietly moving away from her goal of a binding agreement on limiting climate change.
[01:02:53.485 --> 01:02:54.345]  And it continues.
[01:02:55.827 --> 01:02:59.689]  Here is another article out of the National Post.
[01:03:01.051 --> 01:03:14.824]  Seeing countries around the world back away from their climate change commitments and seeing his own electoral support crumble, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced today that Australia will be shelving its cap-and-trade program for at least three years until after the next election.
[01:03:15.165 --> 01:03:23.793]  That will provide the Australian government at the time with a better position to assess the level of global action on climate change, he told the Australian press.
[01:03:24.992 --> 01:03:28.985]  So what's happening there is they're publicly backing off.
[01:03:29.025 --> 01:03:31.332]  Now, Gordon Brown and Obama, they're not.
[01:03:32.881 --> 01:03:33.882]  And Schwarzenegger isn't.
[01:03:34.242 --> 01:03:36.523]  In the U.S., they've still got it in the Senate.
[01:03:36.604 --> 01:03:38.445]  Obama has implemented it two weeks ago.
[01:03:38.485 --> 01:03:42.588]  The EPA is going after factories, coal-powered plants, coal mines.
[01:03:43.028 --> 01:03:51.073]  They're now, outside of law, just creating new fines and fees and expanding other regulatory fees against our industrial base.
[01:03:51.354 --> 01:03:59.519]  Remember, China, India, Mexico, and 100-plus, it's over 160-plus, nations are making zero cuts.
[01:04:00.019 --> 01:04:01.761]  So our industry will just leave and go there.
[01:04:02.597 --> 01:04:02.677]  I'm
[01:04:17.757 --> 01:04:19.198]  It isn't true that polar bears are dying.
[01:04:19.238 --> 01:04:20.538]  It isn't true the ice caps are melting.
[01:04:20.558 --> 01:04:21.199]  They're getting bigger.
[01:04:21.579 --> 01:04:22.359]  It just doesn't matter.
[01:04:22.719 --> 01:04:24.480]  They think the public are a bunch of morons.
[01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:25.881]  And they're not morons.
[01:04:25.901 --> 01:04:27.521]  They're just not focused on real issues.
[01:04:27.801 --> 01:04:29.502]  We're going to get them focused on real issues.
[01:04:29.862 --> 01:04:33.044]  We're going to slap them upside the head with an intellectual 2x4.
[01:04:34.164 --> 01:04:36.825]  That's what we're doing with the films and the radio show and the activists.
[01:04:37.125 --> 01:04:38.006]  And we're not going to stop.
[01:04:39.206 --> 01:04:40.467]  So that is very exciting news.
[01:04:40.507 --> 01:04:42.748]  The problem is Schwarzenegger
[01:04:44.847 --> 01:04:46.629]  In fact, let's Google this for people right now on air.
[01:04:46.649 --> 01:04:48.030]  Let me try to call it from memory.
[01:04:48.070 --> 01:04:48.751]  It's a memory game.
[01:04:48.911 --> 01:04:49.932]  One of the exact headlines.
[01:04:51.013 --> 01:05:00.141]  Schwarzenegger organizes Council of Governors and Mayors to fight climate change.
[01:05:03.044 --> 01:05:03.164]  And
[01:05:04.088 --> 01:05:08.873]  He said, we're going to go to the cities and counties and levy these taxes, and California's now done it.
[01:05:09.533 --> 01:05:14.097]  Austin was seized in a vote last week.
[01:05:16.139 --> 01:05:20.604]  On Earth Day, $2.6 billion in taxes on our power and on our gas.
[01:05:21.997 --> 01:05:23.378]  And it's just all going to the banks.
[01:05:24.079 --> 01:05:30.844]  And so it's going to be a pitched guerrilla info war now, where we're not fighting the big death star of the UN at this point.
[01:05:30.884 --> 01:05:35.267]  They've got their minions working for the banks at the local levels doing this as a guilt trip.
[01:05:35.287 --> 01:05:38.249]  Oh, open the borders up or you're racist.
[01:05:38.369 --> 01:05:40.091]  Oh, you don't want to keep your wages.
[01:05:40.571 --> 01:05:42.753]  Oh, naphthengad is good or you're racist.
[01:05:42.873 --> 01:05:45.915]  Oh, carbon taxes are good or you want to kill the earth.
[01:05:46.235 --> 01:05:49.338]  Oh, guilt, guilt, guilt, guilt, guilt.
[01:05:50.165 --> 01:05:52.126]  But the good news is it's not working anymore.
[01:05:52.146 --> 01:06:04.333]  And on the subject of what Arizona has done, saying that, and I've read the bill, I've covered it here on air, it does not say they're going to set up checkpoints and arrest people with brown skin.
[01:06:04.833 --> 01:06:06.574]  Close to half of Arizona is Hispanic.
[01:06:06.594 --> 01:06:07.414]  They're great Americans.
[01:06:07.935 --> 01:06:08.195]  Okay?
[01:06:11.172 --> 01:06:11.973]  They know what's going on.
[01:06:11.993 --> 01:06:17.958]  That's why in Gallup polls, and some of them are over 80%, most are in the low 70s, of Hispanic Americans want to control the borders.
[01:06:18.358 --> 01:06:23.402]  They don't buy the lie that, well, Hispanics don't want there not to be amnesty.
[01:06:23.822 --> 01:06:24.583]  That's not even true.
[01:06:24.623 --> 01:06:32.149]  That's like a mind control thing where everybody agrees man-made global warming's real, the science is settled, no one disagrees.
[01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:34.991]  Well, it's settled.
[01:06:35.232 --> 01:06:36.873]  All Hispanics want open borders.
[01:06:36.913 --> 01:06:38.594]  Yes, they all want the country overrun.
[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:45.686]  With poor people that will bankrupt the welfare system and who will drive down the wages.
[01:06:46.487 --> 01:06:50.791]  I mean, there's 6 plus billion people who want to come to the United States.
[01:06:51.171 --> 01:06:53.053]  There's 6.5 plus billion people.
[01:06:53.293 --> 01:06:54.234]  There's 300 million here.
[01:06:54.514 --> 01:06:57.537]  So there's 6.2 plus billion people that want to come here.
[01:06:57.737 --> 01:06:59.398]  I mean, have you been to a third world country?
[01:06:59.619 --> 01:07:00.800]  Do you know what it's like?
[01:07:01.601 --> 01:07:05.104]  Believe me, all you people that want open borders, just go to Mexico City.
[01:07:07.807 --> 01:07:10.028]  Go to Mexico City, and then come back.
[01:07:10.388 --> 01:07:11.409]  I mean, it's scary, folks.
[01:07:11.429 --> 01:07:17.973]  25 to 30 million people, dust storms of human feces in the sky, just absolute hell on earth.
[01:07:18.433 --> 01:07:20.014]  The country is completely collapsing.
[01:07:20.554 --> 01:07:27.057]  And I feel sorry for those poor people down there who are desperate for jobs, who've been driven off their property by the UN biosphere movement.
[01:07:27.178 --> 01:07:27.518]  Oh, yes.
[01:07:28.646 --> 01:07:31.847]  They were promised they could move north and get Mckiela Doris jobs on the border.
[01:07:32.228 --> 01:07:36.770]  Almost all of those have been shut down, over 90 percent, because Mexico can't compete with China.
[01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:39.271]  Nothing can compete with the billion slaves.
[01:07:39.831 --> 01:07:42.032]  So it's a giant implosion.
[01:07:42.772 --> 01:07:50.336]  And so Schwarzenegger says that he is now going to have the cities and the counties and the states do it as an act of treason.
[01:07:50.576 --> 01:07:52.677]  The UN coming in to our
[01:07:54.082 --> 01:08:23.008]  country and circumventing the federal government because we're about to gain control the federal government now what we have here is something similar but it's done to defend the republic under the ninth and tenth amendment if the federal government won't carry out its duties it's left to the states to defend themselves and i agree with andrew napolitano that this is gonna get shot down in court what arizona's done uh... but at least because it is the feds purview that's one of the few things i got the jurisdiction on uh...
[01:08:24.482 --> 01:08:35.810]  But the bigger issue here is that, I'm going to ask the judge about this, former federal judge coming up, a real constitutionalist, constitutional scholar, what do you do though when the feds won't do their job?
[01:08:36.670 --> 01:08:37.670]  So how do you respond to that?
[01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:41.291]  Representative wants Arizona immigration law in Texas.
[01:08:41.932 --> 01:08:44.052]  And this is out of NBC Dallas.
[01:08:44.473 --> 01:08:48.974]  Republican Texas lawmaker plans to introduce a tough immigration measure similar to the new law in Arizona.
[01:08:49.314 --> 01:08:51.415]  A move state Democrats say would be a mistake.
[01:08:52.095 --> 01:08:55.116]  But at least this is showing people that the power is at the state level.
[01:08:55.996 --> 01:08:56.496]  Here's another one.
[01:08:56.556 --> 01:08:59.677]  Arizona cities consider fighting immigration law.
[01:09:00.038 --> 01:09:00.898]  Sanctuary cities.
[01:09:01.815 --> 01:09:04.599]  At least, now look, the state is above the city.
[01:09:04.939 --> 01:09:06.401]  The city is chartered by the state.
[01:09:06.822 --> 01:09:08.764]  That's none of their stinking business.
[01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:13.571]  And the cities, it's unconstitutional for them to go challenge at the federal level.
[01:09:14.132 --> 01:09:14.372]  Okay?
[01:09:14.392 --> 01:09:15.994]  And they're a bunch of criminals when they do this.
[01:09:16.755 --> 01:09:19.897]  It's questionable what the state's doing, but they're doing it out of necessity.
[01:09:20.337 --> 01:09:24.800]  And that's in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, that they have some precedent here.
[01:09:25.301 --> 01:09:26.882]  This is out of control.
[01:09:27.382 --> 01:09:30.404]  They have the cities of Arizona bucking the legislature.
[01:09:30.584 --> 01:09:32.646]  That legislature is elected by the people.
[01:09:32.906 --> 01:09:34.227]  That's your boss, okay?
[01:09:34.647 --> 01:09:36.869]  Your city was chartered under the state legislature.
[01:09:37.629 --> 01:09:38.510]  State Constitution.
[01:09:38.890 --> 01:09:42.913]  At least three Arizona cities are considering a lawsuit to block the new immigration enforcement bill.
[01:09:42.953 --> 01:09:44.914]  The cities include Phoenix, Tucson, and Flagstaff.
[01:09:45.575 --> 01:09:46.555]  And it goes on there.
[01:09:46.715 --> 01:09:48.477]  Just absolutely disgusting.
[01:09:49.297 --> 01:09:52.820]  Continuing, here's another headline out of NBC.
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:54.141]  Deport children of illegals.
[01:09:54.821 --> 01:09:56.462]  And that's what a representative is saying out there.
[01:09:56.762 --> 01:09:58.744]  Well, I mean, what do you do when the illegals come across?
[01:10:00.114 --> 01:10:06.296]  And they have ads in the newspapers on both sides in California, especially in Texas, and it says, they call anchor babies.
[01:10:06.676 --> 01:10:17.538]  And they wait, they'll even wait until their water breaks, they'll rush across, go into an emergency room, it's all paid for by taxpayer money, and then immediately the whole family goes on welfare, and we get to pay for it.
[01:10:18.699 --> 01:10:19.319]  Absolutely.
[01:10:19.619 --> 01:10:23.220]  We need to change the laws where we deport these people.
[01:10:24.099 --> 01:10:25.220]  I mean, they need to be deported.
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:28.341]  You can't turn away from the hospital.
[01:10:28.581 --> 01:10:29.782]  But we're all paying for this.
[01:10:30.042 --> 01:10:31.462]  This is why we're going bankrupt.
[01:10:31.502 --> 01:10:32.663]  Folks, you want to lose your job?
[01:10:32.703 --> 01:10:34.144]  You want to lose your country?
[01:10:34.444 --> 01:10:35.484]  You want to go bankrupt?
[01:10:36.105 --> 01:10:37.986]  You want to be like Latin America?
[01:10:38.386 --> 01:10:40.607]  I mean, listen, this is put-up-or-shut-up time.
[01:10:40.647 --> 01:10:42.548]  The country is being butchered right now.
[01:10:43.408 --> 01:10:43.748]  Okay?
[01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:46.369]  And the globalists are doing the same thing in Europe.
[01:10:46.489 --> 01:10:47.910]  They're doing the same thing worldwide.
[01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:51.572]  They bring in outside groups to then be a voting bloc against the nation.
[01:10:54.949 --> 01:10:57.093]  So, absolutely, we have to change that.
[01:10:57.133 --> 01:11:01.720]  I mean, does Mexico let you go down there and have a baby and get free healthcare?
[01:11:02.682 --> 01:11:04.144]  I mean, can I, as a U.S.
[01:11:04.185 --> 01:11:06.568]  citizen, let's put the shoe on the other foot, okay?
[01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:09.671]  Walk a mile in our shoes, Mexico.
[01:11:09.991 --> 01:11:15.314]  Can you go to Mexico and walk in and have your water break in a hospital and have them pay for everything?
[01:11:15.834 --> 01:11:16.155]  No.
[01:11:16.995 --> 01:11:20.937]  And then your baby gets Mexican citizenship and then you all get welfare?
[01:11:20.997 --> 01:11:21.217]  No.
[01:11:21.858 --> 01:11:25.700]  You will pay for it all if the police can find something you've done wrong.
[01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:29.862]  They're going to arrest you, take your kid, and suck a hundred grand out of your family in the U.S.
[01:11:29.902 --> 01:11:30.843]  as extortion artists.
[01:11:31.263 --> 01:11:32.604]  That's what's gonna happen in Mexico.
[01:11:32.844 --> 01:11:45.891]  So, oh, Mexico always playing this guilt, using the goodness of the American people to do this, because what Wells Fargo takes about 30% of the money that's wired back down to Mexico, billions of dollars a year, it's all the big banks.
[01:11:46.432 --> 01:11:51.875]  It's all about using the illegals, using the citizens of America, using us all for the globalists.
[01:11:52.995 --> 01:11:57.238]  So, no, I can't hightail it to Mexico and have everything paid for by the Mexican government.
[01:12:04.056 --> 01:12:04.977]  Tyranny is here.
[01:12:05.317 --> 01:12:09.019]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:12:09.039 --> 01:12:11.461]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:12:11.481 --> 01:12:16.925]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:12:17.345 --> 01:12:23.569]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:12:24.009 --> 01:12:29.572]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:12:29.973 --> 01:12:33.715]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:12:34.175 --> 01:12:38.298]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:12:38.458 --> 01:12:44.001]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:12:44.401 --> 01:12:47.423]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:12:47.963 --> 01:12:49.404]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:12:49.944 --> 01:12:50.385]  It's here.

[01:13:58.806 --> 01:14:01.527]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[01:14:01.767 --> 01:14:05.709]  Are we going to see economic growth, slide into a recession, or at worst, depression?
[01:14:05.929 --> 01:14:07.990]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:14:08.190 --> 01:14:13.212]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[01:14:13.352 --> 01:14:15.092]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[01:14:15.172 --> 01:14:16.473]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[01:14:16.693 --> 01:14:18.154]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[01:14:18.194 --> 01:14:21.277]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[01:14:21.557 --> 01:14:26.601]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:14:26.942 --> 01:14:36.029]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled Ten Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[01:14:36.269 --> 01:14:36.790]  We're good to go.
[01:14:58.271 --> 01:15:00.152]  Hi, this is Steve Schenke, Foods Direct.
[01:15:00.392 --> 01:15:05.615]  We have stopped taking orders for the Buy 3 Get 1 Free program and have started production.
[01:15:05.815 --> 01:15:06.836]  Congratulations!
[01:15:07.136 --> 01:15:13.219]  Your choice to participate in the production of your food supply by pre-ordering will prove very wise.
[01:15:13.579 --> 01:15:18.342]  Shipments will begin the end of March and will be sent in the order that they were received.
[01:15:18.622 --> 01:15:19.522]  Now something fun.
[01:15:19.763 --> 01:15:20.523]  It's springtime.
[01:15:20.703 --> 01:15:28.426]  We all know that garden seeds aren't really a food supply, but they're a great supplement to your food reserve if you have the time and place to garden.
[01:15:28.626 --> 01:15:29.366]  Here's the plan.
[01:15:29.526 --> 01:15:38.090]  When you add a one-month Superfood Spring Pack to your food storage, we'll send you that garden of non-hybrid seeds absolutely free.
[01:15:38.430 --> 01:15:40.311]  Order now while the free seeds last.
[01:15:40.751 --> 01:15:40.991]  Call 800-409-5633
[01:15:43.792 --> 01:15:44.212]  We're good to go.
[01:16:03.387 --> 01:16:07.329]  Alright, we're going to your calls and then Judge Andrew Napolitano is scheduled to be on in the next segment.
[01:16:07.349 --> 01:16:09.310]  I'll tell you about a new sponsor, you're going to love them.
[01:16:09.330 --> 01:16:12.011]  It's Weapons-Universe.com.
[01:16:12.071 --> 01:16:13.712]  Weapons-Universe.com.
[01:16:14.112 --> 01:16:15.873]  Banner is up on InfoWars.com.
[01:16:16.373 --> 01:16:21.155]  They've got some of the best prizes and the biggest selection out there of knives, swords, you name it.
[01:16:21.495 --> 01:16:22.556]  Look at this one they sent us.
[01:16:22.616 --> 01:16:23.716]  And this sucker is dangerous.
[01:16:23.756 --> 01:16:24.997]  I mean, I want this out of the offices.
[01:16:25.017 --> 01:16:27.398]  It's the most possible thing to fall over on somebody.
[01:16:27.978 --> 01:16:32.425]  I'm a big fan of Conan the Barbarian, the first movie, and the Robert E. Howard books.
[01:16:32.485 --> 01:16:39.976]  I can't stand the second one, but this is the sword from that movie and a replica made in Spain.
[01:16:39.996 --> 01:16:43.280]  I mean, this is a fine, fine product, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:46.204 --> 01:16:47.325]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:16:48.145 --> 01:16:54.348]  Give me a wide shot on that camera for Prison Planet viewers so I can really... The sword's so big I can't even show them that.
[01:16:54.668 --> 01:16:57.589]  Weapons-Universe.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:59.090 --> 01:17:00.610]  Just amazing stuff.
[01:17:00.891 --> 01:17:04.032]  High quality stuff at Weapons-Universe.com.
[01:17:04.612 --> 01:17:07.133]  Okay, enough of Conan the Barbarian.
[01:17:07.173 --> 01:17:09.874]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jason in California.
[01:17:09.915 --> 01:17:10.695]  Jason, you're on the air.
[01:17:11.730 --> 01:17:12.910]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:17.012]  I have a Second Amendment call to action for the citizens of the state of California.
[01:17:17.832 --> 01:17:25.334]  Right now it is illegal to open and carry a firearm in the state of California, and there's been a movement recently where people have been exercising this right.
[01:17:25.914 --> 01:17:28.075]  And you know why they want to pass a law now?
[01:17:28.155 --> 01:17:35.977]  Because they were making everybody think guns were illegal with TV ads and PSAs, but now everybody's open carrying and people are going, what, it's not illegal to own a gun?
[01:17:37.150 --> 01:17:42.214]  Yeah, Assemblymember Solanda is sponsoring this bill actually in response to this movement.
[01:17:43.055 --> 01:17:44.876]  It's Assembly Bill 1934.
[01:17:46.077 --> 01:17:53.022]  And again, why would the illegal aliens supporting politicians and the illegal aliens, why would they want to take the guns?
[01:17:53.443 --> 01:17:54.744]  They can't own guns in Mexico.
[01:17:54.804 --> 01:17:57.846]  Why is it always the pro-illegal alien groups that want our guns?
[01:17:58.066 --> 01:18:01.229]  That's the number one reason I say shut it down and deport the illegals.
[01:18:01.409 --> 01:18:02.389]  You're not getting my guns.
[01:18:02.429 --> 01:18:02.810]  Go ahead.
[01:18:03.891 --> 01:18:06.993]  Yeah, I'm a little off topic from the illegal issue, but
[01:18:07.432 --> 01:18:14.197]  I basically want to call on all the listeners in California to respectfully contact their assembly members and implore them to oppose this bill.
[01:18:14.237 --> 01:18:14.897]  It's Assembly Bill 1934.
[01:18:15.318 --> 01:18:24.184]  If you need more information on this bill or open carrying in California, go to www.californiaopencarry.org.
[01:18:25.114 --> 01:18:28.816]  And if possible, I was wondering if we can get the judges' take on this type of legislation.
[01:18:29.236 --> 01:18:30.196]  Sure, absolutely.
[01:18:30.216 --> 01:18:32.357]  I appreciate your call.
[01:18:32.377 --> 01:18:35.839]  Yeah, they're moving at the state level everywhere to get our guns, and it's despicable.
[01:18:36.559 --> 01:18:42.061]  And if they get a big enough illegal alien population voting, they'll get our guns, and they'll arm them as the police to take our guns.
[01:18:42.101 --> 01:18:42.882]  That's the game plan.
[01:18:43.182 --> 01:18:44.563]  Tim in Michigan, you're on the air.
[01:18:44.603 --> 01:18:45.003]  Go ahead.
[01:18:45.023 --> 01:18:46.463]  Hey, Alex!
[01:18:47.184 --> 01:18:47.564]  Hey, buddy.
[01:18:48.304 --> 01:18:49.165]  Hey, what's up, man?
[01:18:49.745 --> 01:18:50.065]  Listen.
[01:18:51.501 --> 01:18:58.506]  I never really got a chance to alliterate on some of the stuff that we had talked about, and I've talked to you a few times.
[01:18:58.586 --> 01:19:02.510]  First off, I'd like to thank you for Invisible Empire and Police State 4.
[01:19:02.710 --> 01:19:04.011]  I've watched both of them.
[01:19:04.591 --> 01:19:05.712]  Very informative.
[01:19:06.233 --> 01:19:07.334]  Very well presented.
[01:19:08.234 --> 01:19:20.204]  And I wanted to tell you about, when we were talking about the Michigan Militia, you talked to me a few weeks ago, I wanted to tell you about some woman named Anna.
[01:19:20.782 --> 01:19:44.581]  Who had been, uh, uh, emailing somebody from the other Michigan militia to, uh, she was climbing down a creek with her 12 year old son to escape the FBI because they were kicking down doors and taking people's children on the basis of that, uh, they were speaking anti-government, uh,
[01:19:45.658 --> 01:19:46.198]  Well, wait a minute.
[01:19:46.238 --> 01:19:47.899]  That happened in Williamson County.
[01:19:47.939 --> 01:19:56.743]  They came and took Barry Cooper's son and they put on the CPS form because they were teaching their children that you can't trust the government.
[01:19:57.123 --> 01:19:58.084]  I appreciate your call.
[01:19:58.444 --> 01:20:04.226]  On the question of the Hitari, that's a whole other subject, but it's now come out what I said before the raid and what I said after.
[01:20:04.246 --> 01:20:06.687]  They had an FBI agent and an informant in there.
[01:20:07.128 --> 01:20:08.168]  They provocateured.
[01:20:08.508 --> 01:20:09.809]  They basically made it all up.
[01:20:10.669 --> 01:20:17.852]  And now it's been confirmed that different Michigan militia groups are the ones that call the FBI on Hatari.
[01:20:17.872 --> 01:20:20.394]  And that's because those groups are full of feds.
[01:20:20.434 --> 01:20:21.954]  That isn't criticizing the militia.
[01:20:22.335 --> 01:20:24.115]  It's not criticizing the Michigan militia.
[01:20:25.987 --> 01:20:32.710]  Feds and Fed-controlled dupes in those militias attack me when I picked out Hattari in August of last year.
[01:20:32.730 --> 01:20:36.092]  We're talking ten months ago, or nine months ago.
[01:20:36.852 --> 01:20:40.714]  Months before this happened, and I said, that Hattari looks like they're being set up.
[01:20:41.014 --> 01:20:46.797]  And I interviewed Pale Horse, aka Sickles, and I warned him that he was being set up if he wasn't a Fed.
[01:20:47.537 --> 01:20:52.880]  And so, you know, we've covered that, we've gone over it, and I've warned militias.
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:21:03.787]  Anybody that starts calling for violence in your ranks, 95% of the time they're fed, and you better rebuke them and expose them immediately, or they are going to set you up.
[01:21:03.887 --> 01:21:08.951]  And then you notice the groups that rebuild a straw man and say, I'm criticizing the militia.
[01:21:09.813 --> 01:21:10.694]  That's not what I've done.
[01:21:11.195 --> 01:21:12.677]  That shows you who the feds are.
[01:21:13.197 --> 01:21:15.480]  Because they don't want me up here warning people.
[01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:25.973]  They want to be able to go and set up the militias and do this around the country and demonize the tea parties and the militia movement that Edwin Vieira and others have promoted for so long.
[01:21:26.513 --> 01:21:27.735]  So I appreciate your call.
[01:21:27.755 --> 01:21:29.036]  We're going to come back with our guest.
[01:21:29.577 --> 01:21:32.618]  And we'll also try to jam a few phone calls in with him as well.
[01:21:33.018 --> 01:21:38.099]  On the other side of this break, and talking about the films, we released two films the last three weeks.
[01:21:38.499 --> 01:21:44.860]  Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, and Invisible Empire, New Order Defined, both available on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:47.920]  They're informative films, and your purchase supports the broadcast.
[01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:48.800]  We'll be right back.
[01:21:50.121 --> 01:21:51.021]  We're on the march.
[01:21:51.501 --> 01:21:53.101]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:54.041 --> 01:21:56.722]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:01.291 --> 01:22:04.912]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:22:05.252 --> 01:22:13.375]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:22:14.115 --> 01:22:18.136]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:22:18.736 --> 01:22:29.560]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:39.202]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:22:39.702 --> 01:22:44.763]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:22:45.124 --> 01:22:52.305]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:22:52.605 --> 01:22:55.366]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:23:03.399 --> 01:23:04.380]  Tyranny is here.
[01:23:04.661 --> 01:23:08.245]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:23:08.285 --> 01:23:10.808]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:23:10.988 --> 01:23:16.295]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:23:16.695 --> 01:23:22.943]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:23:23.343 --> 01:23:28.907]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:23:29.307 --> 01:23:33.030]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:23:33.530 --> 01:23:37.493]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:23:37.793 --> 01:23:43.337]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:23:43.737 --> 01:23:46.740]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:48.721]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:23:49.281 --> 01:23:49.722]  It's here.

[01:25:00.791 --> 01:25:03.014]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:25:03.034 --> 01:25:06.399]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:25:16.155 --> 01:25:17.156]  We are back live.
[01:25:17.196 --> 01:25:22.119]  Judge Andrew Napolitano is our guest for the rest of the hour, rest of the broadcast.
[01:25:22.159 --> 01:25:23.840]  I want to say congratulations.
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:29.243]  He's going to be starting in the next few months his show on the Fox Business TV Network.
[01:25:29.843 --> 01:25:33.826]  That'll definitely get the highest ratings on that channel because he is a constitutionalist.
[01:25:33.846 --> 01:25:37.068]  And I agree with Judge Andrew Napolitano on almost every issue.
[01:25:37.088 --> 01:25:42.431]  In fact, I've never really found anything I disagree with him on, but it caused quite a stir this week.
[01:25:42.451 --> 01:25:43.672]  I'm sure most of you know about it.
[01:25:43.952 --> 01:25:45.393]  We played a clip of it at the start of the show.
[01:25:46.213 --> 01:26:13.707]  uh... earlier today where he said look uh... the federal government's courts are going to find this unconstitutional and that is one of the powers the federal government has uh... one of the three powers and of course he's a former federal judge constitutional law scholar and uh... you know he's saying that this is going to turn off hispanics and the republican party my issue is i've seen the gallup polls as high as eighty percent of hispanic americans want to control the borders because they know it's driving down wages i mean there's a six plus billion people that want to come here
[01:26:14.287 --> 01:26:21.413]  And if we didn't have the big welfare system that would bankrupt us, then I would be for the type of totally open immigration we had a hundred years ago.
[01:26:21.433 --> 01:26:26.337]  But even a hundred years ago, those numbers per capita are much smaller than they are now.
[01:26:26.437 --> 01:26:30.140]  But here to talk about this out of the gates is Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:31.121]  Judge, good to have you here with us.
[01:26:31.141 --> 01:26:32.302]  Well, Alex, it's always a pleasure.
[01:26:32.682 --> 01:26:36.045]  Now you can say that there isn't anything that we disagree on because
[01:26:36.685 --> 01:26:37.646]  That's the key.
[01:26:38.226 --> 01:26:47.710]  It's the social benefit welfare system we have here, which draws good, hard-working people, but lazy people that want the government to take care of them, cradle to grave.
[01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:50.651]  In the break, we were talking about how my grandparents came here.
[01:26:50.671 --> 01:26:58.575]  I mean, they came here, they registered at Ellis Island, they got the vaccinations to make sure they didn't have any communicable diseases, and that was it.
[01:26:58.615 --> 01:27:02.937]  They didn't have to meet a quota, they went to school, they learned English, they became
[01:27:03.758 --> 01:27:09.613]  Productive members of society that didn't have to carry any ID that became citizens as children when they're
[01:27:10.117 --> 01:27:27.343]  Parents became citizens, but that was before the dictatorship of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, which of course changed the relationship of the federal government to individuals by taxing from A to give to B. I always like to tell this story.
[01:27:28.644 --> 01:27:29.744]  There's a knock on your door.
[01:27:29.864 --> 01:27:30.564]  You open the door.
[01:27:30.584 --> 01:27:31.405]  There's a guy with a gun.
[01:27:31.985 --> 01:27:34.126]  And the guy says, give me your money.
[01:27:34.146 --> 01:27:36.066]  I want to distribute it to other people.
[01:27:36.106 --> 01:27:37.527]  I want to be charitable in your name.
[01:27:38.268 --> 01:27:39.129]  You call the police.
[01:27:39.570 --> 01:27:41.412]  You find out he is the police.
[01:27:41.552 --> 01:27:43.935]  That's basically what the government does.
[01:27:43.975 --> 01:27:45.676]  You can't be charitable with other people's money.
[01:27:45.917 --> 01:27:47.218]  You can only be charitable with your own.
[01:27:47.238 --> 01:27:51.383]  But it forces us to give money away to people that we would choose not to give it away.
[01:27:51.443 --> 01:27:53.385]  There's no authority for that in the Constitution.
[01:27:53.846 --> 01:27:56.489]  FDR cowed the Supreme Court.
[01:27:57.089 --> 01:28:07.159]  FDR used all kinds of political favors to get a Democratic Congress to start giving money away, and every president since then, even Ronald Reagan, added to that.
[01:28:07.219 --> 01:28:09.582]  The worst, of course, was LBJ.
[01:28:09.702 --> 01:28:16.148]  As a result, you could come here, legally or illegally, and be taken care of, cradle to grave, by the federal government!
[01:28:16.188 --> 01:28:17.329]  That's what draws people here.
[01:28:17.610 --> 01:28:18.811]  Now, back to what you talked about.
[01:28:19.568 --> 01:28:25.252]  Yes, I was on with Dio Cavuto talking about whether or not Governor Blagojevich can subpoena the President.
[01:28:25.612 --> 01:28:27.253]  Answer, yes, and I hope he does.
[01:28:27.353 --> 01:28:38.460]  I would love to see the President under oath in a federal courtroom in Chicago explaining how the corrupt system of Democratic politics, probably Republican politics as well, but here it's Democratic, under scrutiny works.
[01:28:38.861 --> 01:28:42.103]  As sort of a throwaway question, meaning we had about 40 seconds left,
[01:28:42.623 --> 01:28:49.152]  Neal says to me, by the way Judge, Governor Brewer just signed this piece of legislation in Arizona, what do you think about it?
[01:28:49.232 --> 01:28:52.416]  And of course I said, you know, I believe in state sovereignty.
[01:28:52.816 --> 01:28:56.982]  I believe in state sovereignty so much that I think that the states can take back
[01:28:57.671 --> 01:29:03.960]  The agreement they made with the federal government, that they can nullify what the federal government does, that they can secede from the union.
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:12.451]  However, the one legitimate power that the feds do have is the power to regulate foreign affairs and to regulate foreign people.
[01:29:12.551 --> 01:29:14.374]  The state of Arizona doesn't have any power there.
[01:29:14.614 --> 01:29:23.782]  Moreover, the state of Arizona does not have the power to say to its cops, you can stop people on the basis of the way they look and ask them to prove a negative on the spot.
[01:29:24.042 --> 01:29:26.004]  The negative is that they're not here illegally.
[01:29:26.385 --> 01:29:34.031]  We fought a cold war against countries in Eastern Europe that thought they had the power to stop people on the basis of the way they looked and demand to see their papers.
[01:29:34.852 --> 01:29:40.877]  If this law is enforced, a federal judge might say, you know what, Alex, it's unfair
[01:29:41.798 --> 01:29:45.122]  To only make the immigrants carry ID cards.
[01:29:45.462 --> 01:29:49.727]  So the only way to do this, here's the slippery slope, is for everybody to carry ID cards.
[01:29:50.007 --> 01:29:51.068]  You think I'm making this up?
[01:29:51.088 --> 01:29:52.830]  But Judge, let me interject.
[01:29:53.090 --> 01:29:54.532]  But that's not the slippery slope.
[01:29:54.552 --> 01:29:56.413]  That's indeed what's happening, as you know.
[01:29:56.574 --> 01:29:57.294]  Exactly, Charlie.
[01:29:57.314 --> 01:29:57.635]  Obama...
[01:29:58.095 --> 01:30:06.144]  Obama and Bush's amnesty plan makes everybody have a worker ID card and basically just legalizes all the illegals.
[01:30:06.184 --> 01:30:08.327]  So I go back to the previous point.
[01:30:08.787 --> 01:30:15.795]  If people come across the border an hour before their water breaks, everything's paid for, the kid becomes a citizen, the parents are there,
[01:30:16.215 --> 01:30:20.477]  I've got to pay for it in a democracy, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:30:20.757 --> 01:30:26.920]  This is a giant voting bloc that generally votes to take my guns, take my private property, and make me their slave.
[01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:30.402]  They're being used as a client of the big federal government.
[01:30:30.462 --> 01:30:31.022]  Exactly.
[01:30:31.302 --> 01:30:31.723]  Exactly.
[01:30:31.743 --> 01:30:33.784]  I agree with everything you... So what do we do then?
[01:30:33.824 --> 01:30:37.966]  What do we do when the feds won't carry out one of their only legitimate powers?
[01:30:38.006 --> 01:30:44.689]  Doesn't it fall back to the 9th and 10th Amendment that the states are... I mean, I guess the legitimate way would be then for Arizona to secede.
[01:30:45.731 --> 01:30:49.638]  Yes, that would be the constitutional way for Arizona to do it.
[01:30:50.219 --> 01:30:55.307]  The better way would be to elect a federal government willing to enforce federal law.
[01:30:55.648 --> 01:30:57.050]  And here's the conundrum, Alex.
[01:30:57.451 --> 01:30:59.314]  From Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama,
[01:30:59.992 --> 01:31:03.393]  From a conservative Republican to a liberal Democrat, everything in between.
[01:31:03.433 --> 01:31:05.333]  The two Bushes, Clinton and Carter.
[01:31:05.953 --> 01:31:14.054]  No American president since Richard Nixon has been willing to enforce the immigration laws.
[01:31:14.114 --> 01:31:14.695]  I'll repeat it.
[01:31:14.915 --> 01:31:19.475]  No American president since Richard Nixon has been willing to enforce the immigration laws.
[01:31:19.555 --> 01:31:28.517]  And every American president since Richard Nixon has added to the social safety net for people who can't work or don't want to work
[01:31:28.977 --> 01:31:31.379]  Yeah, your grandparents didn't get any welfare.
[01:31:31.419 --> 01:31:33.100]  They broke their back to build the country.
[01:31:33.621 --> 01:31:34.061]  Correct.
[01:31:34.441 --> 01:31:34.761]  Correct.
[01:31:34.922 --> 01:31:38.524]  The welfare started with FDR and every president has made it worse.
[01:31:38.564 --> 01:31:43.108]  So this is not a problem that can be resolved by interfering with constitutional liberty.
[01:31:43.688 --> 01:31:51.014]  I love the idea of hard-working people coming here and experiencing and enjoying the American dream.
[01:31:51.594 --> 01:31:56.259]  But I do not love interfering with their constitutional liberties and mine.
[01:31:56.580 --> 01:32:12.237]  Because if they can stop somebody on the basis of the way they look, which the Constitution prohibits, in order to find out if they're here legally, then they could stop somebody on the basis of the way they look to find out if they ate too much salt, or ate too much sugar, or whatever else the government wants to regulate.
[01:32:12.907 --> 01:32:24.357]  Sure, and we know these checkpoints 50, 75 miles in all over the country, even in places like Vermont and Maine, they are using it to harass citizens and they let the illegals go right through.
[01:32:24.397 --> 01:32:29.161]  So we know that all these things you're warning about are actually already manifesting themselves.
[01:32:29.522 --> 01:32:31.383]  So here's the big question.
[01:32:32.785 --> 01:32:37.469]  Looking at the legislation, the way I see it, it's as if they have suspicion, probable cause.
[01:32:37.729 --> 01:32:39.510]  You see 10 guys at a day labor site,
[01:32:40.191 --> 01:32:43.673]  Piling into the back of a truck, then you can pull them over.
[01:32:43.993 --> 01:32:54.759]  Or, if you pull somebody over who's swerving, and they don't have IDs, and you arrest them for drunk driving, they can now be deported when it's proven that they're an illegal.
[01:32:54.799 --> 01:32:56.661]  I mean, what was Arizona thinking?
[01:32:57.141 --> 01:33:06.406]  If you're saying, and I respect you, that you've read the bill as a constitutional law scholar, and you're saying you believe it's unconstitutional, then what should they have crafted?
[01:33:06.426 --> 01:33:09.188]  Because Texas is about to get on board, according to NBC.
[01:33:09.628 --> 01:33:11.117]  And other states are flocking to do this.
[01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:25.288]  They should curtail the social benefits that they provide, but in fairness to Arizona, you know, this is all part of the big problem that you and I talk about all the time, which is the micromanagement of all government by the federal government.
[01:33:25.808 --> 01:33:30.251]  Much of what Arizona spends on social welfare is mandated by the federal government.
[01:33:30.291 --> 01:33:31.752]  They have no choice but to do it.
[01:33:32.112 --> 01:33:43.600]  The only way not to do it would be to nullify the federal law or to secede from the union or to persuade the electorate to elect people to Congress that will get rid of the social welfare state
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:49.726]  That actually started with Abraham Lincoln, but in a direct way with Franklin Roosevelt.
[01:33:49.746 --> 01:33:52.068]  Now that's not going to happen overnight, but I've got to say two things.
[01:33:52.328 --> 01:34:01.556]  One, I did not know about the internal checkpoints 50 miles in until you told me about that, and it is my job to know these things.
[01:34:02.057 --> 01:34:04.379]  So I am deeply grateful to you for that.
[01:34:05.373 --> 01:34:13.101]  My great fear is that this immigration issue in Arizona will be used by people like Chuck Schumer and Lindsey Graham.
[01:34:13.141 --> 01:34:14.482]  And I'm not just picking them out of the blue.
[01:34:14.563 --> 01:34:20.249]  They've proposed the legislation which basically says, you know, all these immigrants, legal and illegal,
[01:34:20.609 --> 01:34:21.769]  They have to have an ID card.
[01:34:21.929 --> 01:34:28.552]  But since the federal courts won't let us discriminate between Americans and immigrants, we're going to make everybody have an ID card.
[01:34:28.792 --> 01:34:31.313]  So you can't do anything without showing that ID card.
[01:34:31.593 --> 01:34:35.194]  Then East Germany is here, and maybe even the antebellum South.
[01:34:35.294 --> 01:34:36.094]  Why do I say that?
[01:34:36.414 --> 01:34:39.695]  Because this Arizona law lets you stop people on the basis of the way they look.
[01:34:40.036 --> 01:34:41.616]  Now you know what I look like, Alex.
[01:34:41.676 --> 01:34:47.178]  If I don't shave for two days, and I fall asleep in the sun, and I wake up in Phoenix, they're going to stop me.
[01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:51.921]  And that's not going to be fun.
[01:34:51.961 --> 01:34:53.302]  That's going to create a lot of angry people.
[01:34:53.322 --> 01:34:53.922]  No, it's not going to be fun.
[01:34:53.942 --> 01:34:56.724]  I'm making fun of myself and my own looks.
[01:34:57.044 --> 01:35:11.292]  We live in a society where the government can't do that, where the government can't demand your papers, where the police can't stop you unless they have objective evidence of crime called probable cause, or a search warrant signed by a judge to whom they presented probable cause.
[01:35:11.332 --> 01:35:12.312]  Let me tell you a story.
[01:35:12.633 --> 01:35:16.055]  Driving around in his Monte Carlo, he's been dead for years,
[01:35:16.815 --> 01:35:20.878]  My grandfather was out in the Texas Hill Country, 200 plus miles from the border.
[01:35:21.318 --> 01:35:22.999]  He was pulled over by the Border Patrol.
[01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:28.583]  And I'm going to print the article and give you the name of it right now, but it's up on screen.
[01:35:29.084 --> 01:35:35.848]  But yes, sir, there is a 100-mile, but they normally only go in 75, buffer zone around the entire country.
[01:35:36.289 --> 01:35:39.371]  It's an internal border, 100 miles in.
[01:35:40.592 --> 01:35:45.315]  And it's basically a Constitution-free zone, is what the ACLU calls it.
[01:35:45.815 --> 01:35:52.383]  I agree with the ACLU, and from the reports of it that I have learned about, because of your exposure of it, you are correct.
[01:35:52.443 --> 01:36:00.994]  It is patently unconstitutional, it may not exist, and I'm waiting for a federal judge to comply with his or her oath to uphold the Constitution and invalidate it.
[01:36:01.434 --> 01:36:03.738]  Have you seen the video of the Pastor Anderson?
[01:36:03.758 --> 01:36:04.318]  No.
[01:36:04.919 --> 01:36:11.909]  Who owns a construction company and he has to drive through these every day and he said stop searching my car so they beat him within an inch of his life?
[01:36:12.110 --> 01:36:13.371]  I did not know that.
[01:36:13.391 --> 01:36:14.793]  Did he bring an action against them?
[01:36:15.094 --> 01:36:16.296]  Did he get their videotapes?
[01:36:16.676 --> 01:36:18.138]  We need to get him back on about that.
[01:36:18.158 --> 01:36:22.883]  You know, we cover this stuff and then, you know, it's in the rearview mirror and we never look at it again.
[01:36:23.944 --> 01:36:27.908]  I want to shift gears into some other issues here in a moment with the limited time we have with Andrew Napolitano.
[01:36:28.288 --> 01:36:34.014]  His new book is out, doing quite well, Lies the Government Told You, Myth, Power and the Deception in American History.
[01:36:34.335 --> 01:36:37.818]  Judge Andrew P. Napolitano, forwarded by Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:42.944]  Just in closing, the states are going to move to protect themselves.
[01:36:42.984 --> 01:36:49.710]  They are going bankrupt predominantly because of the illegals and the way they draw on the welfare.
[01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:50.972]  We have sanctuary cities.
[01:36:51.292 --> 01:36:57.458]  We have Austin cops that have told me they won't arrest illegals for drunk driving because they just get released and they're basically told not to do it.
[01:36:57.858 --> 01:37:03.184]  My issue is the illegals now have more rights than citizens in these sanctuary cities.
[01:37:05.575 --> 01:37:08.276]  You know, it's the world turned upside down.
[01:37:08.316 --> 01:37:09.816]  You and I talked about the census.
[01:37:09.876 --> 01:37:10.977]  Again, I'll give you an example.
[01:37:11.057 --> 01:37:11.617]  Knock on the door.
[01:37:11.657 --> 01:37:13.578]  It's a census taker and an FBI agent.
[01:37:13.938 --> 01:37:15.718]  The FBI agent is there to arrest you.
[01:37:15.758 --> 01:37:17.559]  The census taker is there to ask you questions.
[01:37:17.999 --> 01:37:21.040]  The census taker says, how many people live here and how many toilets do you have?
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:24.061]  The FBI agent says, you have a right to remain silent.
[01:37:24.850 --> 01:37:31.713]  So you have more rights as a person being arrested than you do as a person being visited by a bureaucrat from the census taker.
[01:37:32.254 --> 01:37:43.799]  The federal government has succeeded in turning the world upside down in terms of where freedom should be, in terms of where rights should be, and in terms of who can do what with their property.
[01:37:44.559 --> 01:37:45.419]  How do we stop this?
[01:37:45.459 --> 01:37:47.340]  We stop this by the things that you and I do.
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:49.641]  Exposing what the government does.
[01:37:49.881 --> 01:37:51.401]  The camera is the new gun.
[01:37:51.782 --> 01:37:53.602]  Filming what the government does.
[01:37:53.942 --> 01:37:59.064]  Filming the negotiations away of our liberty and our property.
[01:37:59.384 --> 01:38:04.786]  So that everybody can see how those who work for us have betrayed us and the Constitution they've sworn to uphold.
[01:38:04.966 --> 01:38:18.092]  Judge, how about starting with getting our counties and cities back and making our police chiefs have equal enforcement of the law when they catch illegals without insurance, without driver's license, they arrest a citizen, they let the illegals go.
[01:38:18.392 --> 01:38:24.134]  When they catch an illegal drunk driving, we're just going to have to keep them in jail as long as we keep an American citizen in jail.
[01:38:24.395 --> 01:38:29.677]  But Americans are seen as the big fat milk gals, regardless of what color we are, to this system.
[01:38:31.687 --> 01:38:39.314]  Well, I don't know of these cases of which you speak, Alex, in which Americans have been punished for longer than illegals.
[01:38:39.615 --> 01:38:47.002]  Are you telling me that the states have been forced to let illegals go who should be incarcerated because only the feds can incarcerate them?
[01:38:47.322 --> 01:38:48.103]  That's ridiculous.
[01:38:48.183 --> 01:38:52.828]  If an illegal breaks a state law, that illegal can be prosecuted.
[01:38:53.328 --> 01:39:00.994]  And if found guilty, fairly, in a court of law, because the Constitution protects persons, the illegal has the same due process rights as the rest of us.
[01:39:01.155 --> 01:39:05.778]  And when they get out of prison, you can pull this up in the Houston Chronicle.
[01:39:06.139 --> 01:39:08.841]  In fact, pull up, I believe the headline was, 200,000 felons released.
[01:39:14.759 --> 01:39:17.861]  200,000 illegal alien felons released in Texas, and I think that was 2004.
[01:39:18.262 --> 01:39:19.603]  I remember that headline.
[01:39:19.943 --> 01:39:21.184]  Here it is, ACLU.
[01:39:21.484 --> 01:39:23.105]  Two-thirds of U.S.
[01:39:23.145 --> 01:39:31.851]  population lives in Constitution-free zone, and then it goes over the map of the 100-mile border zone, and you can pull that up.
[01:39:32.412 --> 01:39:42.039]  But certainly this is a constitutional crisis that we're going into, because I understand you're a pure libertarian, a pure constitutionalist, and I respect that.
[01:39:42.779 --> 01:39:45.542]  And I understand the issues you're raising here and they're all valid.
[01:39:46.062 --> 01:39:52.108]  But what do you do when the federal government's been seized by offshore banks and is at war against the Constitution?
[01:39:52.469 --> 01:40:00.236]  What do you do when the illegals are coming in and being forged into a political weapon of the collectivist?
[01:40:00.437 --> 01:40:03.340]  The states formed the federal government and not the other way around.
[01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:04.581]  Reagan reminded us of that.
[01:40:05.061 --> 01:40:17.325]  In the second paragraph of his first inaugural address, the states gave limited, specific, precise, delegated, discrete powers, only 16 of them, to the federal government in the Constitution.
[01:40:17.925 --> 01:40:24.627]  Now, when I say this to gatherings all over the country, I say the following, and nothing gets a bigger applause than this.
[01:40:25.247 --> 01:40:28.648]  Power given by the states can be taken back.
[01:40:29.614 --> 01:40:30.715]  That's what you do.
[01:40:31.176 --> 01:40:43.270]  And when the Chuck Schumers and Lindsey Grahams of this world realize that their empire is shrinking, they will either comport themselves as those who love freedom, or they will have no empire over which to reign.
[01:40:44.065 --> 01:40:47.227]  And that brings me to our next issue, but I did want to give you the federal statute.
[01:40:47.487 --> 01:40:59.353]  Federal statute HCFR 287.1A1-3 defines the border zone for enforcement purposes as encompassing an area within 100 miles of the actual border.
[01:40:59.873 --> 01:41:05.218]  And they're now all over the country building hardened checkpoints in the last two years where they search everyone.
[01:41:05.439 --> 01:41:11.444]  There's literally hundreds of YouTube videos of this, and you're an important and influential guy, so I'm glad that you're on the case.
[01:41:11.745 --> 01:41:15.148]  Ask me if I know how members of Congress voted on that statute.
[01:41:15.308 --> 01:41:15.949]  I know the answer.
[01:41:16.309 --> 01:41:16.829]  I don't know.
[01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:17.790]  How did they vote?
[01:41:18.130 --> 01:41:18.871]  Nobody voted.
[01:41:19.151 --> 01:41:20.012]  It's CFR.
[01:41:20.052 --> 01:41:21.793]  It's the Code of Federal Regulations.
[01:41:22.133 --> 01:41:22.974]  It's not the U.S.
[01:41:23.054 --> 01:41:23.354]  Code.
[01:41:23.414 --> 01:41:29.178]  That means Congress authorized a group of bureaucrats to promulgate these rules.
[01:41:29.318 --> 01:41:32.320]  Congress never even voted on the rules themselves.
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:37.443]  The Code of Federal Regulations is ten times as long as the U.S.
[01:41:37.503 --> 01:41:37.703]  Code.
[01:41:37.723 --> 01:41:38.064]  The U.S.
[01:41:38.104 --> 01:41:39.805]  Code are the statutes Congress votes on.
[01:41:40.025 --> 01:41:44.348]  For whatever political or moral or immoral or legitimate or illegitimate reasons,
[01:41:44.748 --> 01:41:46.588]  It's what Congress debates on and votes on.
[01:41:46.608 --> 01:41:47.969]  The health care law is in the U.S.
[01:41:48.009 --> 01:41:48.249]  Code.
[01:41:48.609 --> 01:41:50.629]  The CFR is the insidious one.
[01:41:50.890 --> 01:41:53.190]  That's the one that the bureaucrats have created.
[01:41:53.210 --> 01:41:57.231]  Yeah, it's their own little code that they can just add whatever they want to.
[01:41:57.351 --> 01:41:59.652]  We're about to go to break, but I want to start getting into this now.
[01:42:00.472 --> 01:42:05.453]  Bill Clinton came out and said, gee, I hope there doesn't have to be another Oklahoma City bombing for UT parties to shut up.
[01:42:05.873 --> 01:42:07.934]  The mantra is we're going to cause violence.
[01:42:09.614 --> 01:42:27.682]  When there's no evidence of that, I'm really concerned about them creating a provocation or hyping something, because clearly, the things they've done politically are political suicide, and now they're demonizing you and Ron Paul, calling you both harbingers and enablers of extremism and violence.
[01:42:28.502 --> 01:42:41.053]  I am a harbinger and enabler of individual freedom, of the primacy of the individual over the government, the indispensability of the free market to human prosperity, and of our natural rights, which most governments don't give a hoot about.
[01:42:41.494 --> 01:42:45.917]  Judge Andrew Napolitano is our guest for a final segment straight ahead after this quick break.
[01:42:46.538 --> 01:42:47.078]  His new book,
[01:42:47.901 --> 01:42:52.451]  Lies the Government Told You About is available at Better Bookstores Everywhere and Amazon.com.

[01:44:04.584 --> 01:44:05.504]  Tyranny is here.
[01:44:05.845 --> 01:44:09.426]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:44:09.526 --> 01:44:12.007]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:44:12.027 --> 01:44:17.469]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:44:17.869 --> 01:44:24.112]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:44:24.532 --> 01:44:30.075]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:44:30.515 --> 01:44:34.177]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:44:34.698 --> 01:44:38.700]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:44:38.980 --> 01:44:44.523]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:44:44.943 --> 01:44:47.925]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:44:48.485 --> 01:44:49.906]  The Police State isn't coming.
[01:44:50.467 --> 01:44:50.967]  It's here.
[01:44:51.587 --> 01:44:52.928]  Secure your copy today.
[01:44:59.793 --> 01:45:01.053]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:45:01.093 --> 01:45:06.457]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:45:06.677 --> 01:45:11.301]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:45:11.701 --> 01:45:16.764]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:45:17.285 --> 01:45:21.968]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:45:22.486 --> 01:45:29.409]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:45:29.609 --> 01:45:30.490]  And here's the best part.
[01:45:30.710 --> 01:45:37.092]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:45:37.413 --> 01:45:40.254]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:45:40.594 --> 01:45:43.675]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:45:43.695 --> 01:45:43.915]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:45:52.540 --> 01:45:56.132]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:45:56.453 --> 01:45:58.841]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:46:05.325 --> 01:46:08.287]  We are back live, final segment, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:08.307 --> 01:46:14.972]  Retransmission starts in T-minus six minutes at InfoWars.com and the audio streams on AM and FM's everywhere.
[01:46:15.392 --> 01:46:22.357]  Judge Napolitano, we're seeing massive demonization from MSNBC, CNN, Southern Poverty Law Center, all these groups.
[01:46:22.538 --> 01:46:24.999]  Now they're even saying Ron Paul's bad, you're bad.
[01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:31.364]  They're claiming that we're going to stir up violence with our First Amendment right, criticizing corrupt government.
[01:46:31.384 --> 01:46:32.505]  I mean, this is pretty dangerous.
[01:46:32.925 --> 01:46:38.086]  It's dangerous if they think that they can interfere with our freedom of speech.
[01:46:38.566 --> 01:46:51.049]  It's dangerous for Bill Clinton to say that those who question the government, that those who think taxes are too high, that those who think that life begins at the moment of conception, and that the right to keep and bear arms is a natural right, are dangerous people.
[01:46:51.289 --> 01:46:58.050]  We are traditional Americans who are defending our freedom and will not be silenced by those who are attempting to do so.
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:01.385]  But I think it's backfiring on them.
[01:47:01.405 --> 01:47:03.792]  I mean, people are really seeing through this race card.
[01:47:05.148 --> 01:47:13.094]  You know, I've been to many Tea Parties, you know that, many in the state of Texas, in Ohio, in Arizona, in Florida.
[01:47:13.675 --> 01:47:23.602]  I've not detected a hint of racism, of homophobia, of any of the nonsense that these people that dislike the Tea Partiers claim is there.
[01:47:23.923 --> 01:47:32.089]  What they dislike is the fact that the great middle class has finally been awakened and has finally agreed to read the Constitution
[01:47:32.489 --> 01:47:44.694]  And has finally recognized that we have a government that doesn't respect the Constitution, doesn't honor it, doesn't read it, doesn't even know what it means, thinks it can write any law, regulate any event, tax any behavior, whether it's in the Constitution or not.
[01:47:44.774 --> 01:47:50.596]  And let me tell you, when ordinary people confront members of Congress and say, where is this in the Constitution?
[01:47:51.156 --> 01:47:58.926]  Alex, I have not seen an awareness of freedom like this since Barry Goldwater ran for president against Lyndon Johnson in 1964.
[01:47:59.927 --> 01:48:03.752]  And the establishment in both parties fears this.
[01:48:03.972 --> 01:48:05.313]  Is that why Lindsey Graham...
[01:48:05.914 --> 01:48:09.875]  Is now caving in on open borders and caving in on carbon taxes?
[01:48:10.275 --> 01:48:12.456]  And caving in on ID cards?
[01:48:12.536 --> 01:48:14.516]  Absolutely, because he's part of the establishment.
[01:48:14.536 --> 01:48:18.658]  He's not a lover of freedom like you and me and most of the people listening to us.
[01:48:18.938 --> 01:48:26.160]  He's more interested in his own power than he is in the constitutional liberties and natural rights of those he represents.
[01:48:27.318 --> 01:48:28.959]  We've only got a couple minutes left here.
[01:48:28.979 --> 01:48:32.100]  I wanted to bring up the Goldman Sachs situation.
[01:48:32.220 --> 01:48:38.222]  I see them picking some of the smaller things that Goldman's done so they can then derail a real investigation.
[01:48:38.322 --> 01:48:40.143]  I see it as a big whitewash.
[01:48:40.163 --> 01:48:41.003]  Where do you stand on that?
[01:48:41.223 --> 01:48:42.044]  I agree with you.
[01:48:42.104 --> 01:48:49.086]  I think that Goldman will cave on this litigation brought by the SEC, which is bogus and which is frivolous.
[01:48:49.386 --> 01:48:50.987]  I can tell you why if you want to go into that.
[01:48:51.347 --> 01:48:55.889]  I think that Goldman will cave on it in order to avoid more serious investigations like
[01:48:56.289 --> 01:49:01.473]  How could the Chairman of Goldman Sachs also have been the Chairman of the New York Federal Reserve at the same time?
[01:49:01.953 --> 01:49:05.475]  That's the kind of stuff that they don't want investigated, so they'll cave on this one.
[01:49:05.675 --> 01:49:14.742]  Yesterday, when Lloyd Blankfein appeared before Carl Levin, he said, yes, I'm in favor of the financial regulation the President wants.
[01:49:14.782 --> 01:49:22.647]  Nobody on Wall Street in their right mind is in favor of it, unless you want to curry favor with the establishment, so that after they enact this legislation, they'll leave you alone.
[01:49:23.442 --> 01:49:25.803]  Well, that's the word from the Texas Banking Association.
[01:49:25.843 --> 01:49:30.686]  They say the mega-banks are going to be given new power to go and consolidate their competition.
[01:49:31.006 --> 01:49:36.649]  The worst part about this is that more power is going to the most insidious entity among us, the Federal Reserve.
[01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:47.455]  And if the administration thinks that they're going to be transparent, above board, fair, and respecting of freedom, they have disregarded the past 100 years of human history.
[01:49:48.089 --> 01:49:50.231]  What's the word on the financial takeover bill?
[01:49:50.311 --> 01:49:50.991]  Is it going to pass?
[01:49:51.792 --> 01:49:59.438]  You know, I talked to some Republicans today who told me that they expect the filibuster to succeed and that it won't pass as long as there's the too-big-to-fail in it.
[01:49:59.478 --> 01:50:04.481]  That is, as long as the government can force you to sell them your shares of stock against your will.
[01:50:04.862 --> 01:50:10.026]  That's pretty gutsy of Republicans, who I'm generally critical of, if they'll stick to that.
[01:50:10.914 --> 01:50:12.614]  All right, Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[01:50:12.634 --> 01:50:15.155]  There's a new TV show on Fox Business coming up in the next few months.
[01:50:15.455 --> 01:50:16.395]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:50:16.415 --> 01:50:17.575]  We're always appreciative of the time.
[01:50:17.876 --> 01:50:18.596]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:50:18.936 --> 01:50:19.476]  God bless you.
[01:50:19.596 --> 01:50:20.176]  God bless you.
[01:50:20.936 --> 01:50:22.517]  And we're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:22.557 --> 01:50:27.858]  At the end of the show, I'm going to tell you again, the truth is what can counter the new world order.
[01:50:28.378 --> 01:50:30.698]  We got two new films that have come out in the last three weeks.
[01:50:31.118 --> 01:50:34.259]  Get them both at Infowars.com, Police State 4 and Invisible Empire.
[01:50:34.899 --> 01:50:35.759]  God bless you all.
[01:50:35.799 --> 01:50:37.760]  Retransmission starts now, Infowars.com.
[01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:38.320]  Great job, crew.
[01:50:41.354 --> 01:50:43.197]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:50:44.679 --> 01:50:46.923]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:50:49.988 --> 01:50:55.336]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
