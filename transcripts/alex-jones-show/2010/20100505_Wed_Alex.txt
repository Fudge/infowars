[00:00:20.234 --> 00:00:20.794]  Welcome back.
[00:00:20.834 --> 00:00:22.015]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:00:25.197 --> 00:00:33.143]  We are now simulcasting the syndicated radio broadcast at PrisonPlanet.TV for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:43.025]  I want to go over several important news developments, and then we're going to continue with your phone calls throughout the broadcast.
[00:00:43.065 --> 00:00:51.910]  Steve, Chris, Matt, Tim, and many others that are holding the toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:53.871 --> 00:01:00.035]  Now, Barack Obama became the first president to ever chair the U.N.
[00:01:00.055 --> 00:01:00.875]  Security Council.
[00:01:01.596 --> 00:01:03.297]  We cover this in my film, Fall of the Republic.
[00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:07.220]  We have a little clip of CNN admitting this is what really runs the U.N.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.581]  It has all the power.
[00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:10.642]  The General Assembly is a debating club.
[00:01:11.262 --> 00:01:16.004]  It violates, what, Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S.
[00:01:16.144 --> 00:01:17.044]  Constitution.
[00:01:17.685 --> 00:01:22.467]  In fact, guys, give me one of the, of all the republics, because I want to read the back.
[00:01:22.487 --> 00:01:24.107]  The back has a section of the Constitution.
[00:01:24.427 --> 00:01:28.609]  I believe my memory serves, but I want to make sure that I am correct about that.
[00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:31.490]  I mean, I know it violates the Constitution.
[00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.891]  I'm going to give you the exact subsection.
[00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:36.497]  They did that to set the precedent.
[00:01:36.537 --> 00:01:44.761]  That's why they had Kissinger and all these global diplomats and world leaders there, and they were just gasped when he became the head of the United Nations.
[00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:46.662]  Because that was illegal.
[00:01:47.202 --> 00:01:48.043]  That was treasonous.
[00:01:48.083 --> 00:01:50.204]  That was treacherous.
[00:01:51.985 --> 00:01:52.485]  What happened?
[00:01:54.122 --> 00:01:54.963]  And it's the same thing.
[00:01:55.003 --> 00:02:03.589]  You've got all these members of the Kenyan government, of their parliament coming out, his grandmother saying, yes, he was born here, born in this village.
[00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:08.132]  You have them with the fake, not even birth certificate, but fake receipt of a birth certificate.
[00:02:08.713 --> 00:02:11.395]  You separately have the fact that he did give up his U.S.
[00:02:11.435 --> 00:02:15.418]  citizenship to Indonesia under federal law with that country at that time.
[00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.863]  Makes it to where he is not a person who's eligible for president regardless.
[00:02:23.223 --> 00:02:23.863]  That's a fact.
[00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:26.285]  His real name is Barry Sitaro.
[00:02:26.685 --> 00:02:29.887]  He became an Indonesian citizen, clearly born in Kenya.
[00:02:30.747 --> 00:02:37.692]  And this was done to set the precedent, just like Obama becoming the head of the UN.
[00:02:39.406 --> 00:02:40.327]  Security Council.
[00:02:40.788 --> 00:02:41.608]  Yes, I was correct.
[00:02:41.628 --> 00:02:44.912]  President Obama brazenly violated Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S.
[00:02:44.952 --> 00:02:50.238]  Constitution by seating himself at the head of the United Nations Security Council, thus becoming the first U.S.
[00:02:50.258 --> 00:02:52.200]  President to chair the world body.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.683]  That's covered in the film, Fall of the Republic.
[00:02:56.084 --> 00:03:00.609]  But the issue here is, this is done by design.
[00:03:01.684 --> 00:03:09.567]  They stopped declaring war after World War II so that the executive branch could set up a dictatorship and cut Congress out of the loop.
[00:03:10.568 --> 00:03:11.388]  That's illegal.
[00:03:11.548 --> 00:03:12.209]  That's treason.
[00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:19.812]  But we've had Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm I, Desert Storm II, all these other military operations that are war.
[00:03:20.832 --> 00:03:22.313]  They even call it war on the news.
[00:03:22.593 --> 00:03:26.115]  Before, they were a little more careful and called it police action because it was so illegal.
[00:03:26.455 --> 00:03:27.755]  Now they just say, yeah, it's a war.
[00:03:27.815 --> 00:03:31.077]  The Iraq War, the Afghan War, and all the other wars they're running.
[00:03:32.742 --> 00:03:35.543]  Just like they come out now and say, yeah, the U.S.
[00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:37.404]  Marines and Army are growing the opium.
[00:03:37.444 --> 00:03:41.246]  It's at record levels of production, and we are helping ship it out to the United States.
[00:03:42.386 --> 00:03:45.428]  And they say, because if we don't, Al-Qaeda will get it and sell it.
[00:03:45.448 --> 00:03:47.469]  Well, that's what they told our troops in Vietnam.
[00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:53.191]  Well, we've got to ship this opium out, plus you get a bunch of money from it, guys, and we've got to corrupt you, and you can even go back to the U.S.
[00:03:53.211 --> 00:03:56.093]  when you get out of the military and be a regional drug dealer for us.
[00:03:57.145 --> 00:03:59.647]  We'll make you a police chief, you know, over a city.
[00:04:00.147 --> 00:04:05.651]  That's how this corruption works, because we can't let the commies get the opium that's turned into heroin.
[00:04:10.774 --> 00:04:20.120]  So that said, the fact that he is an Indonesian citizen, the fact that he never gave up that citizenship, the fact that he had to basically give up his U.S.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.164]  citizenship to do that at the time, the fact that he was adopted, that is an in-your-face event.
[00:04:27.162 --> 00:04:31.904]  And then they say we're liars, we're terrorists, it doesn't exist, we just don't like Obama.
[00:04:32.624 --> 00:04:33.745]  No, this is all illegal.
[00:04:33.785 --> 00:04:35.005]  This is setting precedence.
[00:04:35.425 --> 00:04:39.987]  To have a president who's the head of the UN while he's president serving a foreign power.
[00:04:41.388 --> 00:04:46.210]  You know, you can't even take a knighthood when you're in government and a bunch of people have done it.
[00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.010]  That's illegal.
[00:04:48.803 --> 00:04:51.926]  I mean, a president can't serve on the board of a corporation when he's president.
[00:04:52.326 --> 00:04:52.927]  That's illegal.
[00:04:53.187 --> 00:05:00.454]  Well, it's even more illegal to be the head of a world government body that's calling for the end of national sovereignty.
[00:05:00.894 --> 00:05:03.077]  But even if it was a good organization, it'd be illegal.
[00:05:03.537 --> 00:05:04.318]  That is illegal.
[00:05:04.438 --> 00:05:06.840]  Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.541]  Constitution.
[00:05:07.801 --> 00:05:08.241]  Go read it.
[00:05:08.462 --> 00:05:09.403]  It's like Hillary Clinton
[00:05:09.983 --> 00:05:21.440]  Well, the federal government had to pay a four hundred and something thousand dollar fine in the mid-nineties when she went to a Bilderberg Group meeting and it came out that policy was being set in the meeting and so taxpayers had to pay that fine for Hillary.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.185]  Now, governors go, presidents go, they just don't care.
[00:05:25.225 --> 00:05:26.267]  They don't care if it's illegal.
[00:05:28.954 --> 00:05:32.839]  And it's the exact same thing with Barack Obama.
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.202]  The exact same thing.
[00:05:35.462 --> 00:05:37.084]  He knows what he's doing.
[00:05:37.344 --> 00:05:47.036]  And that's why he's had Michelle, three months ago, come out and say, when we went to the country of his birth, and when we went to his homeland of Kenya,
[00:05:47.757 --> 00:05:51.202]  And then now we have a 1997 video, when he was a U.S.
[00:05:51.242 --> 00:05:55.368]  Senator from Illinois, where she is saying basically the same thing.
[00:05:55.388 --> 00:06:02.458]  So let's play the original video of her at a gay and lesbian event, an AIDS event, talking about it.
[00:06:02.518 --> 00:06:04.240]  Then we'll play the newest clip.
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.601]  Here it is.
[00:06:04.991 --> 00:06:05.071]  Okay.
[00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:40.342]  Now let's play this newest clip that just surfaced of Michelle Obama, this time almost three years ago, saying similar things.
[00:06:40.362 --> 00:06:40.702]  Here it is.
[00:06:49.004 --> 00:06:50.284]  Um, two years ago.
[00:06:50.985 --> 00:07:07.468]  Um, and the level of excitement that we felt in that country, the hope that people saw just in the sheer presence of somebody like Barack Obama, a Kenyan, a black man, a man of great statesmanship, who they believe could change the fate of the world.
[00:07:07.848 --> 00:07:12.509]  We are still living in a country that is too mean.
[00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.370]  You see?
[00:07:14.946 --> 00:07:16.726]  And she goes on to repeat similar things.
[00:07:17.086 --> 00:07:30.129]  Now, if that's not enough, here's Obama last week at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, making a joke about his approval rating is low here, but at least in the country of his birth, it's higher.
[00:07:30.209 --> 00:07:30.629]  Here it is.
[00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:33.009]  For my approval ratings, which have just gone down.
[00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:36.590]  But that's politics.
[00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:37.710]  It doesn't bother me.
[00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:43.611]  Besides, I happen to know that my approval ratings are still very high in the country of my birth.
[00:07:46.653 --> 00:07:47.235]  It's so funny.
[00:07:57.774 --> 00:08:03.297]  And you can see the media people going, you can watch their faces when they come to the crowd.
[00:08:03.577 --> 00:08:06.619]  You can see all these media personalities going, that is the country of his birth.
[00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:08.459]  You can even read the woman's lips.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.220]  She's going, that is the country of his birth.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.001]  And they're all going, yeah, he's Kenyan.
[00:08:12.602 --> 00:08:14.603]  It's in your face.
[00:08:14.643 --> 00:08:17.324]  Hey, he's going to head the UN while he's president.
[00:08:17.604 --> 00:08:20.225]  He's going to swear an oath to them while he's president.
[00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:21.746]  Hey, he's going to make jokes.
[00:08:21.766 --> 00:08:22.687]  And then he went on to say,
[00:08:23.467 --> 00:08:27.690]  There aren't several hidden provisions in the health care bill, there are hundreds.
[00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:28.811]  That's actually true.
[00:08:29.291 --> 00:08:30.152]  It ties into the U.S.
[00:08:30.192 --> 00:08:32.694]  Code and into the boards that set the policy.
[00:08:33.815 --> 00:08:36.937]  He goes on to make jokes about the drone attacks, which are real.
[00:08:37.337 --> 00:08:40.500]  Like Bush saying, no WMDs here, no WMDs there.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.342]  This is in your face.
[00:08:44.503 --> 00:08:47.145]  In your face, rubbing your face in it.
[00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:52.094]  And he went on to say, this whole evening's event has been brought to you by Goldman Sachs.
[00:08:52.674 --> 00:08:53.775]  In fact, cue up that actual clip.
[00:08:54.476 --> 00:08:54.776]  Thank you.
[00:08:56.437 --> 00:08:57.378]  The guys do a great job.
[00:08:57.398 --> 00:08:58.259]  I don't give many heads up.
[00:08:58.279 --> 00:08:58.939]  They're so quick.
[00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:01.301]  Hundreds of clips.
[00:09:01.322 --> 00:09:02.683]  We've got over a thousand clips in there now.
[00:09:05.168 --> 00:09:06.689]  He said, but Goldman Sachs doesn't care.
[00:09:06.709 --> 00:09:08.349]  They're going to make money whether you laugh or not.
[00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.550]  See, we don't care if you're not laughing.
[00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:11.571]  We're going to rape you.
[00:09:12.271 --> 00:09:13.112]  I'm from Kenya.
[00:09:13.452 --> 00:09:15.273]  I use drones to kill innocent people.
[00:09:15.533 --> 00:09:16.893]  There are hidden provisions.
[00:09:17.414 --> 00:09:19.675]  And Goldman Sachs did put me in power.
[00:09:20.035 --> 00:09:25.978]  And I'm going to sit up here like a pimp and slap you the hoe in the face and say, listen, I'm going to pay you nothing.
[00:09:26.258 --> 00:09:27.518]  You're going to give me everything.
[00:09:27.838 --> 00:09:29.099]  I've broken your back.
[00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:30.640]  You work for me now.
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:37.501]  It's just like that Pennsylvania ad about, you're our slave, pay the taxes, you're scum, we're watching you.
[00:09:37.801 --> 00:09:41.422]  They want you to know, they want to break your will, they think you're pathetic.
[00:09:41.942 --> 00:09:42.762]  Let's go ahead and play the clip.
[00:09:51.764 --> 00:09:56.925]  By the way, all of the jokes here tonight are brought to you by our friends at Goldman Sachs.
[00:09:58.976 --> 00:10:00.157]  So you don't have to worry.
[00:10:01.157 --> 00:10:03.019]  They make money whether you laugh or not.
[00:10:03.039 --> 00:10:07.962]  There you go.
[00:10:09.773 --> 00:10:33.568]  They make money whether you laugh or not, and there he is with all those elitists, to all the media, and it's such a joke how they get to go to the elite parties and they get the millions of dollars a year in salary, and they're up there perched on top of us, looting us, just like the globalists have looted every other country, and now they're building FEMA camps, and they've militarized the police, and it's just so much fun that they're going to get away with all this, because they think you're broke back.
[00:10:33.648 --> 00:10:35.029]  They think you've capitulated.
[00:10:36.022 --> 00:10:36.803]  I believe in you.
[00:10:37.123 --> 00:10:38.104]  I know you're waking up.
[00:10:38.344 --> 00:10:39.365]  I know you're taking action.
[00:10:39.605 --> 00:10:43.889]  And they're actually acting arrogant to intimidate you because they're scared to death.
[00:10:44.449 --> 00:10:47.172]  They think they're going to run their Stalinistic Hitler off here.
[00:10:47.532 --> 00:10:48.893]  We got news for the scum.
[00:10:49.314 --> 00:10:50.575]  You're going to be brought to justice.
[00:10:51.792 --> 00:10:54.194]  And Arnold Schwarzenegger needs to go back to Austria?
[00:10:54.575 --> 00:10:57.438]  Or maybe he can go, he said on Jay Leno he wants to be president again.
[00:10:57.918 --> 00:11:01.421]  Maybe he can go form his own country on some Caribbean island.
[00:11:01.441 --> 00:11:02.182]  He's got enough money.
[00:11:02.543 --> 00:11:03.664]  Him and Barack can do that.
[00:11:03.724 --> 00:11:04.524]  They can get married.
[00:11:05.285 --> 00:11:07.327]  They can be the first lady and the first man.
[00:11:08.108 --> 00:11:10.130]  And I guess Schwarzenegger will be the first lady.
[00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:11.812]  And they can have their own kingdom.
[00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:16.092]  And, uh, they can be foreign-born presidents there.
[00:11:16.112 --> 00:11:22.495]  You know, the Kenyan can leave, the Austrian can leave, just get out of our country.
[00:11:22.675 --> 00:11:23.276]  Parasites.
[00:11:23.656 --> 00:11:28.279]  We were rich, we were wealthy because we had private property and free market, and you can't... I mean...
[00:11:29.019 --> 00:11:31.260]  Schwarzenegger's always talking about how he's this big free market guy.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.881]  He's for gun control, open borders, cap and trade, global warming taxes, and the Republicans praising.
[00:11:37.242 --> 00:11:39.742]  Filthy, disgusting Republican Party.
[00:11:40.142 --> 00:11:45.504]  Take all of your outlanders and get them out of my nation!
[00:11:45.784 --> 00:11:47.365]  Get out of here, Barack Obama!
[00:11:47.685 --> 00:11:57.508]  Get out of here and go back to Kenya where you advised your cousin Odinga to riot and burn down part of major cities so they would give him a government post when he lost the election.
[00:11:58.288 --> 00:12:04.091]  Go back to Kenya and you can run some Muslim slaughter operations there with your Muslim cousin Odinga.
[00:12:04.451 --> 00:12:05.271]  Just go!
[00:12:05.811 --> 00:12:06.151]  Go!
[00:12:06.291 --> 00:12:07.512]  Just get out of my country!
[00:12:07.792 --> 00:12:11.474]  I'm sick of you and your arrogant lies reading off your teleprompter.
[00:12:11.694 --> 00:12:14.675]  And take that Nazi piece of trash with you, Schwarzenegger.
[00:12:14.695 --> 00:12:17.736]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:12:17.756 --> 00:12:20.958]  I can't look at Schwarzenegger with his little monkey head anymore.
[00:12:21.638 --> 00:12:23.719]  I can't look at these people anymore.
[00:12:26.547 --> 00:12:27.687]  I've read all these quotes of Hitler.
[00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:29.888]  I hate the, excuse me, Schwarzenegger.
[00:12:30.368 --> 00:12:31.989]  You know, I hate the general public.
[00:12:32.009 --> 00:12:32.969]  They're a bunch of scum.
[00:12:32.989 --> 00:12:33.850]  They're so stupid.
[00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:34.990]  I love using them.
[00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:36.911]  I want to be like Hitler.
[00:12:36.951 --> 00:12:38.632]  I want to be worshipped at Nuremberg.
[00:12:39.192 --> 00:12:40.952]  I always dream of being king of the world.
[00:12:41.873 --> 00:12:42.473]  Well, guess what?
[00:12:42.493 --> 00:12:44.034]  You're not going to be king of the world, okay?
[00:12:44.054 --> 00:12:47.775]  No matter all your life extension, money, and funding, you're not going to make it.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:13:07.791]  And I have to sit there and watch the hissing, and the bleeding, and all the CIA people, and the Chertoff group, and Lieberman on TV going, we need to start stripping American citizens of their rights.
[00:13:08.092 --> 00:13:09.613]  They don't deserve fair trials.
[00:13:09.873 --> 00:13:12.496]  We need to arrest them, to set that precedent.
[00:13:12.536 --> 00:13:15.018]  They want so bad to be able to arrest whoever they want.
[00:13:15.458 --> 00:13:19.159]  You know, the federal judge said there's no evidence that Atari was violent, was playing anything.
[00:13:19.259 --> 00:13:20.039]  I ordered them released.
[00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:21.520]  The feds have filed an appeal.
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:22.820]  They can't stand it.
[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:30.422]  They want to just slam you up in a dungeon and say you were going to commit all these terror attacks and then stage terror attacks and grab a patsy.
[00:13:30.682 --> 00:13:32.622]  They can't stand courts.
[00:13:33.142 --> 00:13:36.163]  As corrupt as they are, the truth continues to come out.
[00:13:36.703 --> 00:13:38.004]  And that's what upset me so much.
[00:13:38.084 --> 00:13:39.324]  I was thinking about it.
[00:13:39.864 --> 00:13:41.145]  Today, why am I so angry?
[00:13:41.465 --> 00:13:46.507]  It's listening to the hissing voices on talk radio, the hissing people on television.
[00:13:47.788 --> 00:13:50.650]  Oh, hi, we're talking to a 30-year CIA veteran.
[00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:52.571]  Sir, tell us what we need to do.
[00:13:52.871 --> 00:13:58.994]  We need surveillance cameras tracking human behavior and face scanning everywhere, and the public's scared and they need to be.
[00:13:59.014 --> 00:14:04.397]  This is a new way of life, a new world order, and we need to start arresting citizens and not giving them trials.
[00:14:04.957 --> 00:14:06.018]  Yes, that sounds good.
[00:14:06.078 --> 00:14:06.858]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:14:07.278 --> 00:14:07.959]  I enjoyed it.
[00:14:08.019 --> 00:14:08.399]  Thank you.
[00:14:09.676 --> 00:14:22.161]  I mean, I have to sit there and watch these people perched, these terrorists, these drug narcotics traffickers, just open drug dealers in suits up there, all trying to intimidate people.
[00:14:22.181 --> 00:14:35.745]  I saw We Are Change Oklahoma go to an event with their in-residence CIA guy, 30-year vet, and the guy was all red tie, black, you know, Dracula outfit, and people would ask questions and he'd walk over like a zombie and try to intimidate them.
[00:14:35.966 --> 00:14:37.026]  I mean, I'm just sick of it!
[00:14:37.346 --> 00:14:38.388]  I'm sick of all of it!
[00:14:38.408 --> 00:14:39.610]  I don't want to be your slave!
[00:14:39.931 --> 00:14:41.453]  I don't want you poisoning my water!
[00:14:41.593 --> 00:14:46.742]  I don't want my neighbor kids down the street dying of cancer and you're laughing your murdering butts off!
[00:14:47.023 --> 00:14:48.045]  I see you!
[00:14:48.385 --> 00:14:49.267]  I know who you are!
[00:14:49.287 --> 00:14:50.048]  I don't like you!
[00:14:51.929 --> 00:14:53.249]  I like crystal clear oceans.
[00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:55.270]  I like fields of grain growing.
[00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:56.310]  I like forests.
[00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:57.351]  I like butterflies.
[00:14:57.671 --> 00:14:59.091]  I like swallows.
[00:14:59.611 --> 00:15:00.572]  I like wholesomeness.
[00:15:00.612 --> 00:15:01.452]  I like happiness.
[00:15:01.512 --> 00:15:02.372]  I like wealth.
[00:15:03.012 --> 00:15:04.213]  We have enough wealth for everyone.
[00:15:04.233 --> 00:15:05.153]  We can go to the stars.
[00:15:05.213 --> 00:15:06.313]  I like my species.
[00:15:06.654 --> 00:15:07.614]  I like good things.
[00:15:09.005 --> 00:15:12.746]  I don't hang around at the morgue looking at dead bodies like you people.
[00:15:13.026 --> 00:15:20.289]  I don't think death and blackness and blood and destruction and rotting meat and rape and murder and rapine is beautiful.
[00:15:20.469 --> 00:15:22.650]  And I know what you think is beautiful, okay?
[00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.071]  I can step right inside your operation.
[00:15:25.111 --> 00:15:26.791]  I know exactly who you people are.
[00:15:27.091 --> 00:15:28.752]  You make me want to throw up!
[00:15:29.611 --> 00:15:40.619]  I can't stand you to sit there and watch you perch like carrion vultures on America, picking our bones dry, laughing at us, treating us like trash, reveling in what you've done!
[00:15:40.639 --> 00:15:48.965]  Let me go ahead and cover this.
[00:15:50.947 --> 00:15:55.030]  This stack right here is the firecracker bomb.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.301]  And they just, oh, this would have gone off, it would have just killed hundreds.
[00:15:59.821 --> 00:16:00.982]  It would be so devastating.
[00:16:01.002 --> 00:16:01.822]  Let's talk to this lady.
[00:16:02.182 --> 00:16:03.122]  Oh, I'm so scared.
[00:16:03.423 --> 00:16:04.903]  Put face scanning cameras everywhere.
[00:16:05.183 --> 00:16:06.184]  I want more searches.
[00:16:06.224 --> 00:16:07.484]  I want more body scanners.
[00:16:07.524 --> 00:16:09.005]  My God, it's so scary!
[00:16:09.225 --> 00:16:12.926]  Just a nation just throwing themselves on the altar of cowardice.
[00:16:12.966 --> 00:16:16.067]  Just groveling like snakes on the ground.
[00:16:16.347 --> 00:16:18.728]  Just completely shaking in their boots.
[00:16:18.788 --> 00:16:23.330]  The national religion of cowing and worshipping black uniforms.
[00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.551]  And the talking points just spewing out.
[00:16:29.311 --> 00:16:30.151]  AP sources.
[00:16:30.211 --> 00:16:32.312]  Bomber trained at Pakistan terror camp.
[00:16:35.052 --> 00:16:35.672]  Here's another one.
[00:16:35.712 --> 00:16:36.793]  Times Square eyewitness.
[00:16:36.833 --> 00:16:38.493]  Bomb scare looked like drill.
[00:16:38.633 --> 00:16:43.214]  And we have this police officer saying he had been doing bomb squad activity that day.
[00:16:43.234 --> 00:16:46.535]  And so he was already there, quote, in cop mode.
[00:16:46.995 --> 00:16:48.255]  That's Paul Watson's article.
[00:16:49.778 --> 00:16:51.619]  So, I mean, there's more and more staged.
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:56.203]  Police cameras to flood Manhattan to prevent attacks AP.
[00:16:57.404 --> 00:17:01.847]  And it says that these are behavior systems, face scanning, biometrics.
[00:17:01.907 --> 00:17:02.988]  It's already going in the airports.
[00:17:03.869 --> 00:17:07.752]  Oh, the camera says you might be a terrorist by the looks on your face.
[00:17:07.832 --> 00:17:09.994]  I mean, just total made-up quackery.
[00:17:10.014 --> 00:17:16.238]  I mean, they might as well just have a plastic box with some flashing lights on it and with a plastic dish.
[00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:18.240]  Oh, it says you're a terrorist.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.221]  I've got to take your house.
[00:17:20.182 --> 00:17:25.168]  It took decades to prove lie detector tests were a fraud and used to imprison hundreds of thousands of innocent people.
[00:17:25.588 --> 00:17:28.171]  Now they've just got all these quack machines running around.
[00:17:31.355 --> 00:17:32.456]  Lieberman, no U.S.
[00:17:32.516 --> 00:17:34.239]  citizenship rights for terrorists.
[00:17:36.192 --> 00:17:37.013]  That means you.
[00:17:37.613 --> 00:17:40.696]  When they say you're a terrorist, you don't get a trial.
[00:17:40.997 --> 00:17:45.681]  So Lieberman can get up and... He's already got the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center saying I'm a terrorist, basically.
[00:17:46.502 --> 00:17:48.404]  Oh, we've arrested the terrorist Alex Jones.
[00:17:48.424 --> 00:17:49.444]  He's not getting a trial.
[00:17:50.225 --> 00:17:52.988]  Meanwhile, you got Lieberman there with the match lighting the fuse.
[00:17:53.008 --> 00:17:54.609]  That'd be sick, Lieberman!
[00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.092]  We're gonna wake people up, though, to you, pal.
[00:17:59.861 --> 00:18:01.122]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:18:01.182 --> 00:18:06.504]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:18:06.764 --> 00:18:11.386]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:18:11.766 --> 00:18:16.848]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:18:17.348 --> 00:18:22.050]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:24.451]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:18:24.881 --> 00:18:29.483]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:18:29.683 --> 00:18:30.584]  And here's the best part.
[00:18:30.804 --> 00:18:33.565]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:18:33.885 --> 00:18:37.187]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[00:18:53.979 --> 00:18:56.223]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:18:56.543 --> 00:18:58.907]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:19:00.805 --> 00:19:01.485]  The problem.
[00:19:01.565 --> 00:19:03.647]  How do I cook food without power?

[00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:15.873]  Got some Schwarzenegger quotes here.
[00:21:15.893 --> 00:21:17.433]  This was shot in Pumping Iron.
[00:21:17.453 --> 00:21:20.335]  He later bought the film so this wouldn't be released and had it cut out.
[00:21:21.716 --> 00:21:23.697]  At that point, I didn't think about money.
[00:21:24.457 --> 00:21:27.419]  I thought about the fame, about just being the greatest.
[00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:32.142]  I was dreaming about being some dictator of a country or some savior like Jesus.
[00:21:33.663 --> 00:21:35.487]  Jay Leno, hey, do you still want to be president?
[00:21:35.748 --> 00:21:36.750]  You know I do.
[00:21:37.311 --> 00:21:41.822]  You know I do, Jay, and I'd like to change that law so I can be president.
[00:21:45.287 --> 00:21:47.209]  People need to be told what to do.
[00:21:47.229 --> 00:21:48.950]  It just goes on and on.
[00:21:49.791 --> 00:21:58.657]  All of his disgusting quotes where he talked about how he wanted to be worshipped at Nuremberg-style rallies.
[00:21:58.697 --> 00:21:59.498]  It just goes on and on.
[00:21:59.718 --> 00:22:01.780]  We have it at ArnoldExposed.com.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.161]  Is that website even still up?
[00:22:03.181 --> 00:22:04.162]  I haven't looked at it in about a year.
[00:22:05.062 --> 00:22:11.207]  See if ArnoldExposed.com... Yeah, I want all the quotes.
[00:22:12.168 --> 00:22:13.409]  You can't just read a couple of them.
[00:22:14.727 --> 00:22:18.950]  I want to be a dictator of some country or some savior like Jesus.
[00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:21.752]  Oh, I want to do it.
[00:22:22.132 --> 00:22:23.073]  I want to show you.
[00:22:23.093 --> 00:22:23.993]  I do it.
[00:22:24.113 --> 00:22:24.994]  I run it all.
[00:22:25.274 --> 00:22:26.275]  You little people.
[00:22:27.135 --> 00:22:31.698]  Meanwhile, I mean, he was involved with Enron and the California scam before he was governor.
[00:22:31.978 --> 00:22:33.639]  Then he got in claiming he was fighting it.
[00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.021]  Put Monkeyhead back up there.
[00:22:36.061 --> 00:22:37.782]  Put, uh, there he is.
[00:22:39.944 --> 00:22:41.665]  Our savior, there he is, Hitler.
[00:22:43.032 --> 00:22:44.693]  Just get out of my country, trash!
[00:22:45.053 --> 00:22:45.954]  Stop robbing us!
[00:22:45.974 --> 00:22:47.895]  You're not a Constitutionalist.
[00:22:47.915 --> 00:22:48.796]  You're not an American.
[00:22:48.816 --> 00:22:50.877]  I've got nothing against Germans or Austrians.
[00:22:50.897 --> 00:22:53.979]  I'm talking about Arnold A. Louis Schwarzenegger.
[00:22:54.319 --> 00:22:55.740]  He makes me want to throw up.
[00:22:55.961 --> 00:22:56.741]  Here's some more quotes.
[00:22:57.241 --> 00:23:00.524]  My relationship to power and authority is that I'm old for it.
[00:23:01.044 --> 00:23:02.105]  Arnold Schwarzenegger, U.S.
[00:23:02.125 --> 00:23:02.905]  News and World Report, 1990.
[00:23:04.656 --> 00:23:06.858]  People need somebody to watch over them.
[00:23:07.238 --> 00:23:12.221]  Ninety-five percent of the people in the world need to be told what to do and how to behave.
[00:23:12.301 --> 00:23:12.481]  U.S.
[00:23:12.501 --> 00:23:13.142]  News & World Report, 1990.
[00:23:14.543 --> 00:23:16.864]  My friends don't want me to mention Cutt's name.
[00:23:17.305 --> 00:23:18.766]  Top SS officer, head of the U.N.
[00:23:19.566 --> 00:23:24.910]  My friends don't want me to mention Cutt Voltheim's name because of the recent Nazis dub and the U.N.
[00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:25.570]  controversy.
[00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:29.093]  But I love him, and Maria does too, and so thank you, Cutt.
[00:23:29.613 --> 00:23:30.414]  Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:23:31.835 --> 00:23:33.296]  That's what he said at the wedding in front of the media.
[00:23:34.167 --> 00:23:35.268]  I was born to be a leader.
[00:23:35.709 --> 00:23:37.771]  I love the fact that millions of people look up to me.
[00:23:39.233 --> 00:23:43.558]  I was always dreaming about very powerful people, dictators and things like that.
[00:23:43.939 --> 00:23:50.426]  I was always just impressed by people who could be remembered for hundreds or even, like Jesus, be thousands of years remembered.
[00:23:50.446 --> 00:23:52.208]  I have delusions of grandeur.
[00:23:52.228 --> 00:23:53.310]  I'm on so much steroids.
[00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:53.990]  I added that part.
[00:23:56.247 --> 00:23:57.548]  I saw this toilet bowl.
[00:23:57.808 --> 00:23:59.688]  How many times do you get away with this?
[00:23:59.989 --> 00:24:04.170]  To take a woman, grab her upside down, and bury her face in the toilet bowl.
[00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.390]  I wanted to have something floating there.
[00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:08.311]  The thing is, you can do it.
[00:24:08.531 --> 00:24:10.411]  Because in the end, I didn't do it to a woman.
[00:24:10.732 --> 00:24:11.652]  She's a machine.
[00:24:11.992 --> 00:24:15.613]  You would get away with that without being crucified by who knows what group.
[00:24:16.994 --> 00:24:18.956]  Arnold Schwarzenegger describing a scene from Terminator 3.
[00:24:18.996 --> 00:24:24.542]  I mean, it just goes, just a, a, a, a avarice-filled goblin.
[00:24:25.202 --> 00:24:28.105]  An inhuman, dominating...
[00:24:29.409 --> 00:24:29.749]  I don't
[00:24:48.424 --> 00:24:49.645]  That's treason!
[00:24:49.685 --> 00:24:50.885]  That's tyrannous!
[00:24:50.945 --> 00:24:51.345]  Maximus!
[00:24:51.385 --> 00:24:52.046]  That's maximum tyranny!
[00:24:52.066 --> 00:24:52.826]  Maximum oppression!
[00:25:12.827 --> 00:25:14.068]  That's the terror threat!
[00:25:14.128 --> 00:25:15.629]  That's who you should be worried about!
[00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:17.691]  People like Arnold Schwarzenegger!
[00:25:17.731 --> 00:25:18.952]  People like Joe Lieberman!
[00:25:19.272 --> 00:25:20.733]  That's your enemy right there!
[00:25:21.093 --> 00:25:22.074]  That's the problem!
[00:25:22.094 --> 00:25:23.876]  That's the guy raping California!
[00:25:24.116 --> 00:25:26.718]  That's the guy that wants carbon taxes in your guns!
[00:25:26.958 --> 00:25:28.659]  That's the guy who thinks he owns you!
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.982]  That's the person that thinks he owns you and your family!
[00:25:32.182 --> 00:25:33.643]  That's the guy who's for eugenics!
[00:25:33.843 --> 00:25:35.925]  He loves that they're poisoning your water supply!
[00:25:36.165 --> 00:25:37.046]  That's your enemy!
[00:25:37.066 --> 00:25:38.007]  We'll be back!

[00:27:16.289 --> 00:27:20.352]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:25.892 --> 00:27:27.853]  We need to get our fighting spirit back.
[00:27:27.873 --> 00:27:31.535]  We need to find our manhood, our humanity again.
[00:27:31.555 --> 00:27:40.421]  We need to rouse the sleeping giant that is the republic and crush the globalists, drive the parasites out of the nation, arrest them!
[00:27:40.441 --> 00:27:44.063]  Alright, I'm gonna go to phone calls for a while and try to cool down and then I'm gonna...
[00:27:45.916 --> 00:27:52.837]  I'm going to get into how they're using race to control the population, how FEMA is now directly taxing the American people to fund its global government takeover.
[00:27:54.118 --> 00:27:56.418]  We're going to continue with all of this today.
[00:27:56.438 --> 00:28:01.359]  I've got a bunch of stacks of key news I haven't gotten to yet, but right now let's go back to your calls.
[00:28:01.779 --> 00:28:03.440]  Steve in Arkansas, you're on the air.
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.520]  Hello, Alex.
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:09.801]  I want to put a call out to all info warriors in the state of Arkansas.
[00:28:10.461 --> 00:28:15.442]  We have a governor's race this November, and we have a liberal Democrat named B.B.
[00:28:16.533 --> 00:28:25.160]  That's our governor, and he's very likely to get re-elected, and the Republicans have put up a vanilla, plain vanilla, you know, establishment type.
[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:38.890]  And so, what we're trying to do, Alex, is get a third-party candidate on the ballot, Constitution Party, and the gentleman that's running Constitution Party is a man by the name of Frank Gilbert.
[00:28:39.671 --> 00:28:45.335]  He's the mayor of a small town, and he wants to push state sovereignty, he wants to
[00:28:45.939 --> 00:28:55.761]  campaign on nullification of Obamacare and nullification of a lot of the overreaches of the federal government that sow seeds of state sovereignty throughout the state.
[00:28:56.621 --> 00:28:57.401]  Well, you know what?
[00:28:57.421 --> 00:29:00.222]  We've got thousands and thousands of listeners every day in Arkansas.
[00:29:00.242 --> 00:29:02.422]  Everybody needs to rally and get behind him.
[00:29:03.442 --> 00:29:05.923]  And can I get out a website, Alex, to go to?
[00:29:05.963 --> 00:29:06.143]  Sure.
[00:29:07.143 --> 00:29:09.304]  It's gilbertforgovernor.org.
[00:29:09.504 --> 00:29:11.304]  That's Gilbert, the number four.
[00:29:11.809 --> 00:29:14.131]  Gilbert4Governor.org.
[00:29:14.251 --> 00:29:15.432]  Hey, let me change subjects, Steve.
[00:29:15.452 --> 00:29:24.599]  Did you hear me read all the articles where the majority of states are going bankrupt or are bankrupt and they're going, oh, we raised all the taxes and tax receipts went down.
[00:29:24.899 --> 00:29:26.080]  We didn't know that would happen.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:32.024]  These engineers, that's 101 that when you raise taxes, you get less revenue.
[00:29:32.785 --> 00:29:34.506]  They want to destroy the economy.
[00:29:35.507 --> 00:29:38.529]  Yes, Alex, and here in this state, our governor bought into the
[00:29:39.232 --> 00:29:39.652]  Thank you.
[00:29:53.698 --> 00:29:58.741]  And businesses across the state are having to pay just a tremendous increase for unemployment taxes.
[00:29:58.902 --> 00:30:00.983]  Believe me, you want to see the taxes here.
[00:30:01.083 --> 00:30:02.264]  People say, well, just don't pay them.
[00:30:02.804 --> 00:30:04.525]  I'm running a pretty good-sized operation.
[00:30:04.866 --> 00:30:06.046]  I've got to choose my battles.
[00:30:06.467 --> 00:30:07.787]  But, I mean, it is getting bad.
[00:30:08.028 --> 00:30:10.289]  And the economy, everybody can see it.
[00:30:10.409 --> 00:30:11.890]  It is just getting worse and worse.
[00:30:12.331 --> 00:30:14.292]  And the media's saying, hey, the economy's good.
[00:30:14.312 --> 00:30:15.453]  You're all losing your jobs.
[00:30:15.993 --> 00:30:19.655]  But the one benchmark is the banks are making record profits.
[00:30:20.056 --> 00:30:22.117]  And so we're just going to accelerate it.
[00:30:22.177 --> 00:30:23.178]  I appreciate your call.
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:25.063]  It's just disgusting.
[00:30:25.123 --> 00:30:26.488]  Chris in Kentucky, thanks for holding.
[00:30:28.133 --> 00:30:28.555]  Hey Alex.
[00:30:29.056 --> 00:30:29.357]  Hey buddy.
[00:30:31.095 --> 00:30:37.740]  What you just said with the Lance Caller, the media during the Kentucky Derby this weekend just did the same thing and how everything is looking up.
[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:40.282]  They used the media as a record crowd for the Kentucky.
[00:30:40.322 --> 00:30:44.205]  Now they have troops running around arresting people this time to condition folks.
[00:30:44.785 --> 00:30:46.586]  Exactly, and they were on motorcycles.
[00:30:46.947 --> 00:30:48.508]  I didn't watch it.
[00:30:48.588 --> 00:30:52.591]  So, I mean, last year I happened to be at a restaurant when it was on TV.
[00:30:52.611 --> 00:30:53.892]  I happened to see troops running around.
[00:30:54.972 --> 00:30:55.633]  What happened this year?
[00:30:56.254 --> 00:30:58.194]  Well, this year, you know, there was a lot of propaganda about it.
[00:30:58.214 --> 00:31:08.956]  You know, Chief Robert White, by the way, who's a candidate for the Dallas Police Department, I don't know if he's going now, but the media was interviewing him a day before the Oaks, saying that it's really good to have all this security out here.
[00:31:08.976 --> 00:31:11.097]  And they were talking about the police and military working together.
[00:31:11.177 --> 00:31:16.398]  And the jokes about the media just says, well, if we need more reinforcements, Fort Knox is right in the other county.
[00:31:16.438 --> 00:31:17.538]  I mean, I'm just sick and tired.
[00:31:17.558 --> 00:31:21.899]  And in the next county, Fort Knox, that very week, was training to take on the Tea Parties.
[00:31:23.231 --> 00:31:27.636]  And I'm just, that's what just burns me up, these people in this category start waking up, and if we don't.
[00:31:27.676 --> 00:31:33.985]  But I did meet some people locally here, some college kids that do listen to your show and are waking people up, because David Ray Griffin was here last week, too.
[00:31:34.385 --> 00:31:35.647]  Well, I'll tell you how the news works.
[00:31:35.687 --> 00:31:36.809]  They pre-interview people.
[00:31:36.849 --> 00:31:37.590]  I've told the story.
[00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:39.592]  I know somebody that works at the Austin airport.
[00:31:40.453 --> 00:31:47.119]  And, uh, he talked about how he saw them interview over 40 people about the increased security and 39 said they didn't like it.
[00:31:47.719 --> 00:31:53.224]  As soon as they got to one old lady who liked it, they shut their cameras down and left, and then that was on the news that night.
[00:31:53.484 --> 00:31:55.426]  So that's how they distort and warn.
[00:31:55.706 --> 00:31:57.328]  They find the groveling slaves.
[00:31:59.875 --> 00:32:02.478]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:32:02.899 --> 00:32:07.866]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:32:08.226 --> 00:32:09.968]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:32:10.269 --> 00:32:15.095]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:32:15.275 --> 00:32:16.236]  How much do you want?
[00:32:16.457 --> 00:32:17.198]  When do you want it?
[00:32:17.578 --> 00:32:19.160]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:32:19.461 --> 00:32:20.282]  When will you need it?
[00:32:20.522 --> 00:32:22.605]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:32:22.725 --> 00:32:23.827]  Will there be any food?
[00:32:24.067 --> 00:32:25.409]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:32:25.609 --> 00:32:30.676]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:32:30.876 --> 00:32:34.001]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:32:34.441 --> 00:32:37.945]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:32:38.265 --> 00:32:39.246]  How much will you need?
[00:32:39.486 --> 00:32:40.107]  We don't know.
[00:32:40.387 --> 00:32:41.308]  How much do you want?
[00:32:41.508 --> 00:32:42.229]  All you can get.
[00:32:42.429 --> 00:32:43.270]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:46.293]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:32:46.573 --> 00:32:48.335]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:32:48.355 --> 00:32:49.276]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:33:00.205 --> 00:33:08.311]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[00:33:08.671 --> 00:33:19.118]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[00:33:19.578 --> 00:33:25.002]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[00:33:25.562 --> 00:33:30.045]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[00:33:30.445 --> 00:33:39.171]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[00:33:39.511 --> 00:33:49.338]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[00:33:49.638 --> 00:33:52.800]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:33:53.321 --> 00:33:54.341]  SilverLungs.com.
[00:33:58.843 --> 00:34:00.124]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:34:00.164 --> 00:34:05.506]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:34:05.746 --> 00:34:10.367]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:34:10.767 --> 00:34:15.849]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:34:16.329 --> 00:34:21.031]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:34:21.551 --> 00:34:28.476]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[00:34:28.676 --> 00:34:29.576]  And here's the best part.
[00:34:29.777 --> 00:34:32.578]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:34:32.839 --> 00:34:36.161]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:34:36.481 --> 00:34:39.323]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:34:39.663 --> 00:34:42.745]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:34:42.765 --> 00:34:42.965]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:34:42.985 --> 00:34:43.266]  Remember,
[00:34:51.611 --> 00:34:55.193]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:34:55.514 --> 00:34:57.975]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:35:00.937 --> 00:35:03.158]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:35:03.178 --> 00:35:06.721]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:07.901 --> 00:35:08.342]  Okay.
[00:35:10.203 --> 00:35:13.505]  I've gotten behind with calls and covering news, but in the final hour,
[00:35:16.792 --> 00:35:23.197]  I'm going to get to race-based politics and how it's being used to control people and bring out some historical perspective.
[00:35:23.838 --> 00:35:32.866]  Then in the last half hour, I'm going to get into the fact that it is an overpopulation myth on this planet and that the West is actually dying.
[00:35:32.886 --> 00:35:33.867]  We're going to go over the numbers.
[00:35:34.367 --> 00:35:40.812]  Very important information we need to get out to everybody coming up in the last hour today.
[00:35:41.833 --> 00:35:43.154]  Right now, I want to go back to your calls.
[00:35:43.174 --> 00:35:50.941]  Then we have another guest joining us to deal with all of these FEMA activities, forcing people to buy insurance, which is underwritten by FEMA.
[00:35:50.961 --> 00:35:58.507]  In fact, guys, I saw in my folder that that original article about that guy from the local newspaper we have him having on was not in there.
[00:35:59.308 --> 00:35:59.968]  So I need that.
[00:36:00.008 --> 00:36:01.650]  All I have is his bio.
[00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:02.070]  Thank you.
[00:36:02.491 --> 00:36:05.373]  Okay, let's go to Matt in Boston.
[00:36:05.433 --> 00:36:06.174]  Matt, you're on the air.
[00:36:06.194 --> 00:36:06.574]  Go ahead.
[00:36:07.154 --> 00:36:08.375]  Hi, how are you doing, Alex Jones?
[00:36:08.576 --> 00:36:08.776]  Good.
[00:36:10.076 --> 00:36:12.699]  I would love to thank you for everything that you're doing.
[00:36:12.719 --> 00:36:14.701]  I feel like you don't get praised enough when you're on the air.
[00:36:15.242 --> 00:36:18.105]  I just feel like, you know, I'm 22 years old.
[00:36:18.165 --> 00:36:19.146]  I'm working in Boston.
[00:36:19.166 --> 00:36:20.507]  I've worked many different jobs.
[00:36:21.148 --> 00:36:29.757]  And I think like now or now, like during these days, these past few days, I've been seeing a lot of people coming to me about what's going on with, you know,
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:31.381]  The police state.
[00:36:31.521 --> 00:36:33.922]  People are worried about getting pulled over everywhere.
[00:36:34.163 --> 00:36:42.409]  But according to the news, everyone loves it because, thank God they were running a drill when the bomber hit like they are every time.
[00:36:42.469 --> 00:36:43.790]  Thank God they saved us.
[00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:52.376]  I mean, we've got to give up all our freedoms and pay all our taxes and let the banks take over because if we don't, Al-Qaeda will get us.
[00:36:54.698 --> 00:36:55.558]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[00:36:55.598 --> 00:36:56.859]  It's just ridiculous.
[00:36:56.919 --> 00:36:57.900]  I really appreciate you
[00:36:58.433 --> 00:37:01.856]  Telling the people the complete truth about whatever is going on.
[00:37:02.376 --> 00:37:11.203]  It's just so disgusting to watch Mr. Obama up on screen basically telling everybody that yeah, you're getting raped of your money and all sorts of things.
[00:37:11.303 --> 00:37:17.908]  It's like I'm looking at my life and what it could be like 20 years down the road and I want to have a private property.
[00:37:17.968 --> 00:37:21.670]  I want to be able to like live my life the way I want to live it.
[00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:23.472]  Basically, you're saying you're a terrorist.
[00:37:24.107 --> 00:37:26.308]  Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying.
[00:37:26.668 --> 00:37:29.869]  It's absolutely ridiculous, and it bothers me.
[00:37:30.029 --> 00:37:33.210]  Well, I mean, how do we think the communists were going to take America over?
[00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:37.092]  And again, communists that work for the big banks to steal our wealth at the international level.
[00:37:37.532 --> 00:37:39.213]  They were going to stage terror attacks.
[00:37:39.233 --> 00:37:41.794]  They were going to do it in the name of protecting us.
[00:37:41.834 --> 00:37:43.294]  That's how it's always done.
[00:37:43.674 --> 00:37:44.755]  And now it's happening.
[00:37:45.515 --> 00:37:52.578]  Alex, I think the most frustrating thing for people of my age, and I think many people of my age, and even the people that work with you, can say the same thing.
[00:37:53.516 --> 00:38:06.701]  That the people that are about, you know, 50 to 60 years old that had been, you know, you know, listening to the regular media for their entire lives, like including my stepfather and my family, they just, they don't know what the truth is.
[00:38:06.761 --> 00:38:10.162]  They just look at the box and think that everything that comes through it is the truth.
[00:38:10.723 --> 00:38:16.244]  And it's just, it's so aggravating, because when you start talking about the real issues with people, they don't even want to talk about it.
[00:38:16.264 --> 00:38:34.708]  Well see, and TV, TV's all designed like, you know, they're reading off the teleprompter and the info babe's smiling at you, and it's all about how they're going to keep you safe, and we're your friends, and the government loves you, and oh, we hope the Tea Party didn't do the bombing, but don't worry, we've got the army training to take them on!
[00:38:35.268 --> 00:38:39.589]  Anybody that criticizes the loving bankers wants to hurt children!
[00:38:40.149 --> 00:38:42.691]  I mean, it's just such elementary brainwashing.
[00:38:43.712 --> 00:38:45.193]  Oh, it's absolutely ridiculous.
[00:38:45.274 --> 00:38:49.397]  It's like, you know, I went through the public school systems and when I was, you know, about
[00:38:51.466 --> 00:38:51.847]  I don't
[00:39:12.143 --> 00:39:12.704]  Exactly!
[00:39:12.744 --> 00:39:38.305]  Most of school, and I appreciate your call, is about how to behave, how to be obsessed with race, how to, you know, in the name of fighting racism, which is tribalism, it's just obsess on it, you know, to learn about how the government loves you, you know, the textbooks about global warming is going to kill you, and there's too many people, and we're all going to have microchips soon, and world government's good, and the New World Order's good.
[00:39:38.325 --> 00:39:39.726]  I mean, that's in the textbooks!
[00:39:41.721 --> 00:39:49.886]  And no child left behind was the Feds just fully taking over education to accelerate the federalization and the brainwashing.
[00:39:50.246 --> 00:39:51.427]  I appreciate your call, Matt.
[00:39:51.847 --> 00:39:53.588]  Let's talk to Tim in Brazil.
[00:39:53.648 --> 00:39:54.369]  Tim, you're on the air.
[00:39:54.389 --> 00:39:55.910]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:57.931]  This is Tim Anderson, a professional wrestler.
[00:39:57.951 --> 00:39:59.112]  I just came from the States.
[00:39:59.192 --> 00:40:01.233]  I came back down here for a match.
[00:40:02.554 --> 00:40:02.994]  Oh, man.
[00:40:03.094 --> 00:40:04.055]  Arnold Schwarzenegger, dude.
[00:40:04.115 --> 00:40:08.858]  A lot of people don't know that he still runs the Arnold Classic in Columbus, Ohio every year.
[00:40:10.356 --> 00:40:12.177]  Yeah, the big steroid fest.
[00:40:12.478 --> 00:40:13.618]  Yeah, huge, man.
[00:40:13.658 --> 00:40:16.480]  I mean, it's all over and people just don't know about it.
[00:40:17.021 --> 00:40:20.964]  And on top of that, we're talking about a man that didn't even show up for his own father's funeral.
[00:40:21.004 --> 00:40:37.735]  And then, like you said later, when people for, you know, when he was running for governor, he bought the movie back so that he could take things out of the movie, including him talking about being senseless, no sensitivity towards human feelings, emotions, so that he could win contests.
[00:40:37.755 --> 00:40:39.597]  And his father died and he didn't show up for the funeral.
[00:40:40.856 --> 00:40:41.616]  It's disgusting.
[00:40:41.656 --> 00:40:42.637]  I appreciate your call.
[00:40:42.657 --> 00:40:43.617]  Good to hear from you, Tim.
[00:40:44.078 --> 00:40:45.238]  Pepper in Arizona.
[00:40:45.278 --> 00:40:46.119]  Pepper, you're on the air.
[00:40:46.139 --> 00:40:47.979]  Hi.
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:55.063]  Well, I'm in Arizona, and there's a couple of things going on today in Arizona that's really disgusting.
[00:40:55.943 --> 00:41:05.328]  The first thing being that the Reverend Al Sharpton is supposed to be leading a group of protesters from a Phoenix church down to the Capitol again today.
[00:41:05.348 --> 00:41:07.829]  So all the major news media is there.
[00:41:08.767 --> 00:41:11.409]  I'm not sure exactly what time that's all going to come down.
[00:41:11.429 --> 00:41:18.633]  I wonder if the illegals will set fire to restaurants and attack people like they did with torches in Santa Cruz.
[00:41:18.773 --> 00:41:23.136]  Or I wonder if they'll attack police again and then it won't even be on the national news.
[00:41:24.377 --> 00:41:29.140]  Or, you know, continue to smear all their refried beans all over our capital.
[00:41:30.521 --> 00:41:34.624]  And then the other thing is that the Sons team
[00:41:35.859 --> 00:41:41.642]  The owner of the Suns team, Farger, has actually come out against the bill.
[00:41:42.303 --> 00:41:57.752]  Yeah, and he's changing the name of the team to Spanish, to like make it about controlling our border as anti-Hispanic, to create the illusion that we can't have a border, we can't have a country, or we're racist.
[00:41:58.812 --> 00:42:05.036]  Well, not to stop, but that's what's going on tonight, is that they are wearing their Spanish jerseys tonight,
[00:42:05.906 --> 00:42:17.015]  And what we're trying to do with our Tea Party groups is that we're trying to get everybody together, the hope anyway, and go down there with signs that says, hey, we don't have tickets, but we're entitled, let us in.
[00:42:17.035 --> 00:42:18.736]  So, I don't know.
[00:42:18.836 --> 00:42:20.478]  Hey, that, exactly.
[00:42:20.538 --> 00:42:22.399]  You should get box seats for free.
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:23.520]  I know.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:26.062]  And if they don't give you free seats, they're racist.
[00:42:27.083 --> 00:42:32.847]  Well, and you know, another thing too is that I have learned that there's a new definition for racist.
[00:42:33.047 --> 00:42:33.768]  According to
[00:42:34.284 --> 00:42:44.738]  People hear that if you're white, you're a racist, if you want secure borders and things like that, if you're Latino and Hispanic and supporting the bill, then you're a sellout.
[00:42:44.858 --> 00:42:48.202]  My daughter-in-law has come from the Dominican Republic.
[00:42:48.222 --> 00:42:52.408]  She's done it legally, has spent thousands of dollars trying to do that.
[00:42:53.351 --> 00:42:57.094]  And people are calling her a sellout because she supports the bill.
[00:42:57.354 --> 00:42:58.115]  A sellout?
[00:42:58.475 --> 00:43:00.957]  Yeah, well, the illegals have sold out to the bankers.
[00:43:01.818 --> 00:43:03.519]  And it's just disgusting.
[00:43:03.559 --> 00:43:04.520]  I appreciate your call.
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:05.201]  Great points.
[00:43:06.081 --> 00:43:07.583]  Excellent points, Pepper.
[00:43:07.883 --> 00:43:09.684]  Let's talk to Laura in Texas.
[00:43:09.704 --> 00:43:10.665]  You're on the air, Laura.
[00:43:11.866 --> 00:43:12.547]  Hey, Alex.
[00:43:12.947 --> 00:43:13.187]  Hi.
[00:43:13.788 --> 00:43:16.850]  This is one of the Info Warriors here, calling into your show.
[00:43:17.671 --> 00:43:22.555]  I recently went to a tea party in Dallas.
[00:43:23.437 --> 00:43:27.140]  And, uh, when Mark Davis, that scumbag, was talking.
[00:43:28.661 --> 00:43:32.384]  And, uh, you know, he called all of us truthers cult members.
[00:43:35.146 --> 00:43:37.208]  Dirty, despicable cult members.
[00:43:37.648 --> 00:43:38.429]  Yes, yes.
[00:43:39.009 --> 00:43:41.912]  And Medina says, I agree, I agree, you know.
[00:43:41.972 --> 00:43:44.694]  And you're supposed to say, oh, I love that flip-flop.
[00:43:44.954 --> 00:43:46.655]  Oh, I worship you too.
[00:43:49.264 --> 00:43:50.225]  Yeah, I know.
[00:43:50.425 --> 00:43:55.147]  I've actually ran into her a few times before, you know, at luncheons.
[00:43:56.108 --> 00:43:57.088]  Well, let's get this straight.
[00:43:57.108 --> 00:43:59.429]  I don't think Debra Medina's bad, and I still said vote for her.
[00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:07.734]  But for her to say it's healthy and good, and the towers did fall in a strange way, and all these interviews, and then agree that we're despicable, evil trash.
[00:44:07.974 --> 00:44:09.055]  You know, oh, I agree.
[00:44:09.375 --> 00:44:10.235]  Oh, yes, Mark.
[00:44:10.295 --> 00:44:10.595]  Yes.
[00:44:10.756 --> 00:44:11.296]  Oh, they are.
[00:44:11.316 --> 00:44:13.177]  I mean, you know, that's wrong.
[00:44:13.497 --> 00:44:14.798]  Now, the straw man people,
[00:44:15.598 --> 00:44:24.763]  A few of them, and some people in her campaign actually did this, it was a dirty trick but it failed, you know, too bad for them, to say that I was mad because she wasn't a truther.
[00:44:25.083 --> 00:44:28.325]  When she was in my studio and on the air, I never even brought up 9-11 truth to her.
[00:44:28.725 --> 00:44:29.806]  I never made an issue out of it.
[00:44:29.846 --> 00:44:33.028]  But the straw man was, Alex doesn't like her because she's not a truther.
[00:44:33.428 --> 00:44:34.989]  No, it was the flip-flop.
[00:44:35.229 --> 00:44:44.614]  If Ron Paul suddenly came out and said, I'm against auditing the Fed, I'm pro-war, and did a flip-flop, I would say, man, we got a problem with Ron Paul.
[00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:53.777]  But according to these people, I should just say, oh, I should like Newt Gingrich because he believes global warming is real.
[00:44:54.497 --> 00:44:56.900]  Again, I'm not allowed to have my political views.
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:57.660]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:44:57.981 --> 00:44:58.901]  I know how you feel.
[00:44:59.602 --> 00:45:00.883]  So what did you say to Mark Davis?
[00:45:00.903 --> 00:45:01.284]  You booed him?
[00:45:02.379 --> 00:45:12.863]  Um, we were in the crowd, and we were like, yeah, that guy's right, because this guy was wearing, you know, one of your shirts at foolwars.com, like the shirts that we've bought from your show, several of them.
[00:45:13.423 --> 00:45:16.645]  And he was just, you know, saying, you're a liar, you're a liar, Mark Davis.
[00:45:16.845 --> 00:45:24.688]  And we videotaped some of it, you know, what we could get of it, because we didn't want him to, you know, do anything to him.
[00:45:25.208 --> 00:45:27.009]  But they kicked him out.
[00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:33.027]  And then they proceeded to kick us out because we were handed out freedom to fascism.
[00:45:34.265 --> 00:45:35.366]  Oh yeah, no, no, no.
[00:45:35.406 --> 00:45:46.514]  You don't go to a Republican neocon tea party and hand out a disc calling for an audit of the Fed made by a Jewish guy because criticizing the Federal Reserve is anti-Semitic.
[00:45:46.534 --> 00:45:47.354]  That's the spin.
[00:45:49.176 --> 00:45:59.543]  Again, they make it about that and invoke the race and class stuff, but how dare you try to hand out American freedom to fascism?
[00:45:59.563 --> 00:46:00.724]  That is so evil.
[00:46:01.124 --> 00:46:02.685]  You don't criticize the IRS.
[00:46:02.705 --> 00:46:03.286]  They're good.
[00:46:04.977 --> 00:46:08.818]  The thing is that the guy said, oh, you're not allowed here and everything.
[00:46:08.898 --> 00:46:11.759]  And you know, we were just, you know, out there handing out movies.
[00:46:11.779 --> 00:46:13.800]  We weren't drinking like a bunch of them were, you know?
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:14.740]  Well, just remember that.
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:17.301]  That's the Tea Party Express, not the real tea party.
[00:46:17.621 --> 00:46:19.221]  And they're having trouble taking it over.
[00:46:19.261 --> 00:46:20.942]  They had some success, but people woke up.
[00:46:21.562 --> 00:46:29.685]  And so just let all those Republicans, they want to lose their bank accounts and pension funds, they want to lose their Bill of Rights, they love naked body scanners, don't worry!
[00:46:30.105 --> 00:46:41.849]  You know, if they're successful, the Republicans will come in and continue everything Obama did, and then the Democrats will put another Democrat in and they'll feel like they're winners, and then it'll just keep going and we'll all be idiot slaves.
[00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:42.930]  So how did this end?
[00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:49.648]  Well, it ended that we handed out 300 DVDs of Freedom to Fascism, even though they kicked us out.
[00:46:49.968 --> 00:46:55.776]  And if you go to our website, educatorsofliberty.com, you'll find that we are very active.
[00:46:56.037 --> 00:46:57.279]  You have done well!
[00:46:59.841 --> 00:47:02.744]  If you suffer from poor sleep, you've gotta try MyPillow!

[00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:51.671]  MyPillow.

[00:48:00.299 --> 00:48:01.120]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:06.664]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:48:06.844 --> 00:48:07.264]  I get it.
[00:48:07.405 --> 00:48:16.732]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:48:17.012 --> 00:48:18.173]  That's not what's happening.
[00:48:18.413 --> 00:48:26.658]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:48:26.898 --> 00:48:30.140]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:34.362]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:48:34.563 --> 00:48:35.543]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:48:36.143 --> 00:48:39.385]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:48:40.106 --> 00:48:43.708]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:48:43.908 --> 00:48:44.628]  You should, too.
[00:48:44.808 --> 00:48:45.769]  Find out what they know.
[00:48:45.969 --> 00:48:49.250]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.310]  800-686-2237.
[00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:49.630]  800-686-2237.
[00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:49.851]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:48:59.708 --> 00:49:02.009]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:49:02.089 --> 00:49:04.289]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:49:04.409 --> 00:49:07.190]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:12.372]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:49:12.712 --> 00:49:16.913]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:49:17.233 --> 00:49:19.554]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:49:19.574 --> 00:49:22.095]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:49:22.115 --> 00:49:25.016]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:49:25.377 --> 00:49:32.980]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:38.585]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:49:38.705 --> 00:49:40.987]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:49:41.027 --> 00:49:44.990]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:46.151]  And I got news for you.
[00:49:46.331 --> 00:49:47.632]  You're everyone else.
[00:49:47.672 --> 00:49:48.673]  Invisible Empire.

[00:49:58.891 --> 00:50:02.754]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[00:50:02.815 --> 00:50:06.578]  My name is Span, and I'm 68 years old, and I live in Vermont.
[00:50:06.997 --> 00:50:11.481]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[00:50:11.741 --> 00:50:13.663]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[00:50:13.823 --> 00:50:15.144]  Made me feel breathless.
[00:50:15.545 --> 00:50:19.588]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[00:50:19.988 --> 00:50:21.009]  Nothing did anything.
[00:50:21.049 --> 00:50:25.013]  Heart and Body Extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[00:50:25.033 --> 00:50:28.496]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered Heart and Body Extract.
[00:50:29.176 --> 00:50:31.779]  I noticed a difference quickly, within days.
[00:50:32.239 --> 00:50:36.883]  The episodes became less frequent and by a month had completely vanished.
[00:50:37.263 --> 00:50:39.865]  Usually you find a 30-day or 60-day guarantee.
[00:50:40.065 --> 00:50:44.708]  Heart and Body Extract comes with a lifetime 100% ironclad money-back guarantee.

[00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:48.211]  866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[00:51:02.628 --> 00:51:04.989]  We are back live, continuing with your phone calls.
[00:51:05.009 --> 00:51:08.729]  We're going to spend about 10-15 minutes looking at FEMA's shenanigans.
[00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:12.610]  FEMA is its own taxing authority now.
[00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:14.891]  We'll explain how coming up.
[00:51:15.971 --> 00:51:18.611]  But right now, let's go to Mark in Maryland.
[00:51:18.652 --> 00:51:19.332]  You're on the air.
[00:51:19.352 --> 00:51:20.972]  How you doing, sir?
[00:51:21.152 --> 00:51:21.872]  Pretty good, my friend.
[00:51:22.792 --> 00:51:26.533]  I just want to, if it's okay, make a few quick bullet points.
[00:51:26.673 --> 00:51:28.494]  I'll try to be quick because I know you don't have a lot of time.
[00:51:30.509 --> 00:51:36.558]  First thing is I wanted to get your take on Bill Maher because I've used to be a fan but
[00:51:37.159 --> 00:51:39.701]  It seems like now, it seems like he's just a part of it.
[00:51:39.761 --> 00:51:41.603]  I mean, I don't know if he's a part of the media.
[00:51:41.783 --> 00:51:44.665]  Look, he plays the part of a left gatekeeper.
[00:51:45.165 --> 00:51:52.151]  He'll admit vaccines have got a problem because, you know, that's very popular and most Americans know that's the truth now, despite the propaganda.
[00:51:53.132 --> 00:51:54.953]  And he'll lie every time there's a dust storm.
[00:51:54.993 --> 00:51:56.174]  He says it's global warming.
[00:51:56.935 --> 00:51:58.156]  He pushes the police state.
[00:51:58.216 --> 00:52:02.459]  I mean, Bill Maher, Bill Maher's a political operative.
[00:52:05.297 --> 00:52:09.779]  I mean, I don't doubt it, because now when I listen to him, it just really seems like he's helping push the agenda.
[00:52:09.819 --> 00:52:12.120]  Well, that's because Bush is out of power.
[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:21.364]  When the Democrats are in power, their supporters and hacks and pundits and proxies, they then are the establishment.
[00:52:21.884 --> 00:52:24.205]  And the Republicans are posing as anti-tyranny.
[00:52:24.546 --> 00:52:27.367]  Now, as soon as they change places again, it's a tag team.
[00:52:27.747 --> 00:52:30.808]  It's like a wrestling match between Hulk Hogan and Jesse Ventura.
[00:52:31.108 --> 00:52:32.029]  It's not real.
[00:52:32.709 --> 00:52:34.530]  As Jesse has said, it's not real.
[00:52:34.711 --> 00:52:40.114]  But you tell kids, I mean, I remember being a kid in Dallas and I'd be at a friend's house watching wrestling, and I'd say, look, that's not real.
[00:52:40.494 --> 00:52:42.316]  And they'd say, shut up, Alex, it is real.
[00:52:42.656 --> 00:52:49.921]  And the general public, you just, you know, they're still, Republicans are still, the Republican Party is good, and I like them.
[00:52:50.321 --> 00:52:53.623]  And the Democrats are, Obama's good, and I like them.
[00:52:54.143 --> 00:52:55.464]  And that's why they're robbing us.
[00:52:55.564 --> 00:53:02.109]  People have just got to grow up and get into issues and become constitutionalists, not partisan twits.
[00:53:03.851 --> 00:53:04.432]  I agree, sir.
[00:53:04.513 --> 00:53:06.316]  And two things real quick and I'll let you go.
[00:53:07.593 --> 00:53:08.793]  Well, actually three, real quick.
[00:53:08.873 --> 00:53:15.618]  George Carlin, he was a Bill Morris from the George Carlin camp, and I know George Carlin would probably agree with you on everything, so I don't understand this.
[00:53:15.978 --> 00:53:29.466]  Well, George Carlin, you know, we have an interview with him in Truth Rising about 9-11 Truth, and he said he thinks 9-11's a lie, and I don't agree with George Carlin on God and stuff, but I mean, George Carlin was real and wasn't a political hack.
[00:53:29.727 --> 00:53:34.830]  He said, there's a club and you ain't in it, there's a global elite, they're dumbing you down with the schools,
[00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:41.553]  So, George Carlin was about 90% right, and Bill Maher is about 20% right.
[00:53:41.893 --> 00:53:43.754]  So, two different animals.
[00:53:44.074 --> 00:53:48.397]  Please, let's not compare George Carlin, who I'm a fan of, on most issues.
[00:53:48.537 --> 00:53:52.999]  I really think he was a very talented person, with the other person.
[00:53:54.298 --> 00:53:55.860]  Okay, the last thing real quick.
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:54:08.313]  Dr. Steve Greer, I know you don't like to get involved with the UFO talk because it scares away people, but I've heard Dr. Greer talk about the same stuff you're talking about, about the hidden agenda of the government that we don't know about.
[00:54:08.494 --> 00:54:09.535]  And what about Hawking?
[00:54:09.995 --> 00:54:11.056]  Last statement.
[00:54:11.196 --> 00:54:12.677]  Is that anything to do with Project Bluebeam?
[00:54:29.597 --> 00:54:38.562]  Unless it's interdimensional travel, there's probably so much life out there, if you want my opinion on all this, like Christ said, I have other flocks.
[00:54:38.923 --> 00:54:47.768]  There is so much life out there that we're probably like an amoeba floating along in a stream in the middle of a forest.
[00:54:47.788 --> 00:54:50.489]  They're not particularly focused on the amoeba.
[00:54:51.610 --> 00:54:56.213]  I'm not saying we're not important and we're part of this larger system and we're going to grow into something even more amazing.
[00:54:58.476 --> 00:55:21.133]  I don't mind people that talk about chupacabras and aliens and I mean that's interesting and I think it's okay people thinking and debating and outside the political box that's probably a healthy thing overall and the whole disclosure project and the rest of it I mean the Lord only knows what's going on the army is admittedly training to confiscate our guns in mainstream news and the public
[00:55:21.997 --> 00:55:23.239]  Calls it a conspiracy theory.
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:31.355]  So I don't get off into all the other things that are going on and alien technology and things like that because...
[00:55:32.745 --> 00:55:34.586]  Because I can't bonafide prove it.
[00:55:35.027 --> 00:55:39.049]  But I don't slight those that want to research it and look at it.
[00:55:39.550 --> 00:55:40.791]  You know, like Coast to Coast AM.
[00:55:40.811 --> 00:55:44.293]  You know, they have some shows where they cover the Federal Reserve and the New World Order.
[00:55:44.553 --> 00:55:48.816]  They have other shows where they cover, you know, our aliens visiting the planet.
[00:55:49.597 --> 00:55:53.359]  That's number one talk show in the country at night.
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:55.481]  Second biggest show in the world after Limbaugh.
[00:55:55.801 --> 00:55:57.522]  Sixteen million listeners conservatively.
[00:55:58.943 --> 00:55:59.364]  And so,
[00:56:00.626 --> 00:56:06.509]  You know, I think it's fine what Coast to Coast is doing, because it's at least getting people to debate and think.
[00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:10.731]  It's not a judgment I'm making that I don't cover those subjects.
[00:56:10.791 --> 00:56:21.076]  It's just that I'm dealing with the healthcare takeover, I'm dealing with the census, I'm dealing with the wars, I'm dealing with the nanotechnology that they're putting into the food and vaccines.
[00:56:21.456 --> 00:56:26.318]  I'm just sticking to what is absolutely immediate, and I know I can do something about it.
[00:56:26.678 --> 00:56:27.179]  And believe me,
[00:56:27.859 --> 00:56:35.261]  If I'm out camping six months from now and a flying saucer lands in front of me and little green men walk off of it, I'm going to be talking about it on air.
[00:56:35.561 --> 00:56:39.763]  But I have not seen, you know, Martians.
[00:56:40.903 --> 00:56:42.744]  And so I don't cover Martians.
[00:56:43.564 --> 00:56:46.505]  But a lot of astronauts say that they have seen UFOs.
[00:56:47.105 --> 00:56:48.345]  And so something's going on.
[00:56:49.826 --> 00:56:50.726]  We're on the march.
[00:56:51.226 --> 00:56:52.807]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:56:53.747 --> 00:56:56.448]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.522 --> 00:57:04.945]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:57:06.166 --> 00:57:10.928]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:57:11.308 --> 00:57:18.092]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:57:20.033 --> 00:57:22.375]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:57:24.115 --> 00:57:26.477]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:57:28.533 --> 00:57:32.395]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:57:33.116 --> 00:57:36.238]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[00:57:36.958 --> 00:57:37.779]  Others don't.
[00:57:38.179 --> 00:57:40.080]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:41.841]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:57:42.121 --> 00:57:44.683]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[00:58:03.166 --> 00:58:04.086]  Tyranny is here.
[00:58:04.426 --> 00:58:08.048]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:58:08.068 --> 00:58:10.568]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:58:10.588 --> 00:58:16.030]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:22.692]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.

[00:58:47.065 --> 00:58:48.485]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:58:49.046 --> 00:58:49.466]  It's here.

[00:58:59.411 --> 00:59:02.012]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:59:02.432 --> 00:59:07.395]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:59:07.755 --> 00:59:09.476]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:59:09.796 --> 00:59:14.619]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:14.799 --> 00:59:15.759]  How much do you want?
[00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:16.720]  When do you want it?
[00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:18.700]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:19.801]  When will you need it?
[00:59:20.061 --> 00:59:22.121]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:22.261 --> 00:59:23.362]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:23.582 --> 00:59:24.922]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:59:25.122 --> 00:59:30.183]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:30.383 --> 00:59:33.564]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:33.964 --> 00:59:37.445]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:37.785 --> 00:59:38.765]  How much will you need?
[00:59:39.005 --> 00:59:39.626]  We don't know.
[00:59:39.926 --> 00:59:40.826]  How much do you want?
[00:59:41.026 --> 00:59:41.766]  All you can get.
[00:59:41.946 --> 00:59:42.807]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:43.047 --> 00:59:45.808]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:46.088 --> 00:59:46.448]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:46.608 --> 00:59:47.848]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:47.868 --> 00:59:48.789]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:27.952]  We are back live and I've got a guest on for this segment and we're going to continue with your calls and a bunch of news in the next hour.
[01:00:28.972 --> 01:00:32.833]  Levy official, FEMA plans a scam to raise money.
[01:00:32.853 --> 01:00:40.414]  That's from KATV television and we've got the chief engineer and levy district head on with us going to him
[01:00:40.974 --> 01:00:42.094]  In just a moment.
[01:00:42.134 --> 01:00:49.437]  Another way these agencies are setting up their own illegal taxing authorities and covert massive taxes.
[01:00:49.737 --> 01:00:50.878]  Getting a lot of phone calls.
[01:00:50.918 --> 01:00:55.399]  People on hilltops are being told they've got to buy flood insurance from FEMA.
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:00.601]  Just like the government health care plan makes you buy insurance and the government gets part of it.
[01:01:00.621 --> 01:01:02.002]  So we're going to be talking about that in a moment.
[01:01:02.442 --> 01:01:05.103]  We're carrying a lot of new books and videos.
[01:01:06.201 --> 01:01:07.382]  at InfoWars.com.
[01:01:07.982 --> 01:01:13.565]  In fact, we've added two new videos today to the online video bookstore shopping cart.
[01:01:13.846 --> 01:01:20.590]  These are the most informative titles, the best info I've seen out there, not to mention the twenty-plus films I have directed and produced.
[01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:23.331]  It's all available at InfoWars.com.
[01:01:23.371 --> 01:01:26.693]  We have Jesse Ventura's new book, a New York Times bestseller.
[01:01:26.793 --> 01:01:30.135]  It's number four on the New York Times bestseller list, American Conspiracies.
[01:01:30.195 --> 01:01:32.557]  It gets into just so many important issues.
[01:01:33.137 --> 01:01:38.442]  You can get this book discounted and get a free film of your choice at InfoWars.com.
[01:01:38.462 --> 01:01:44.006]  We're also now carrying his last bestseller, Don't Start the Revolution Without Me, heavily discounted.
[01:01:44.126 --> 01:01:48.911]  And we're carrying Fletcher Prouty's The Secret Team that's back in paperback.
[01:01:49.471 --> 01:01:53.955]  This thing's like hundreds of dollars if you try to buy one of the originals.
[01:01:53.995 --> 01:01:58.458]  Fletcher Prouty, the head of Black Ops, who came out and exposed the fact that the CIA killed Kennedy.
[01:01:58.698 --> 01:02:01.781]  He wrote the book JFK that much of the film JFK was based on.
[01:02:02.121 --> 01:02:03.302]  We also have that book now.
[01:02:04.163 --> 01:02:11.369]  And The Secret Team in paperback put out by Skyhorse Publishing, the same folks that are publishing Jesse Ventura's books.
[01:02:11.809 --> 01:02:13.610]  It was Jesse a few weeks ago who was on air with us.
[01:02:13.650 --> 01:02:14.911]  The governor pointed out
[01:02:15.748 --> 01:02:19.011]  That these books were back in print now because he kind of pushed Skyhorse to do it.
[01:02:19.671 --> 01:02:24.876]  And so now they're available at InfoWars.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:25.116 --> 01:02:26.757]  And we've got some specials involved with these.
[01:02:26.817 --> 01:02:27.578]  It'll blow you away.
[01:02:27.898 --> 01:02:28.919]  It spreads the word.
[01:02:28.959 --> 01:02:30.881]  It gets the info out and your purchase of
[01:02:31.221 --> 01:02:37.145]  Patriot t-shirts, ball caps, bumper stickers, wristbands, videos, films.
[01:02:37.586 --> 01:02:39.087]  It funds our operation.
[01:02:39.107 --> 01:02:40.668]  I want to thank all of you that do that.
[01:02:40.688 --> 01:02:47.492]  And all of my films are posted in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv for PrisonPlanet.tv members as well.
[01:02:48.493 --> 01:03:03.697]  But if you go to InfoWars.com, our new film, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, the ten military regions under NORTHCOM, the new Governor's Council that circumvents the states, specially picked state governors under federal control, bypassing the states.
[01:03:03.997 --> 01:03:07.378]  That's covered in Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, and so much more.
[01:03:07.878 --> 01:03:11.579]  Jason Burmess' new film I produced, Invisible Empire, a new order to find.
[01:03:11.619 --> 01:03:16.641]  These two new films are so important to get at InfoWars.com or call toll-free 888.
[01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:22.004]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9, that's 8-8-8-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[01:03:22.024 --> 01:03:25.486]  And don't forget Fall of the Republic.
[01:03:25.506 --> 01:03:37.335]  We detail the banking takeover, how Obama has become the head of the United Nations Security Council in violation of Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution, how the banks plan to totally destroy the economy.
[01:03:37.575 --> 01:03:38.696]  Now you see that unfolding.
[01:03:38.996 --> 01:03:41.298]  This is a film every American has to see.
[01:03:41.318 --> 01:03:46.602]  If you want to understand the eugenics, endgame blueprint for global enslavement, why the globalists are setting this up,
[01:03:47.402 --> 01:03:51.686]  Shadow government by great filmmakers exposes the whole COG takeover system.
[01:03:52.066 --> 01:03:57.251]  All available at Infowars.com today, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:57.471 --> 01:03:59.393]  Or you can write to me, Alex Jones, at P.O.
[01:03:59.413 --> 01:04:02.876]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[01:04:03.696 --> 01:04:06.959]  And I know you, the listener, already know all this information, or most of it.
[01:04:07.299 --> 01:04:08.861]  It's your neighbors, your friends, your family.
[01:04:09.121 --> 01:04:11.423]  You can talk till you're blue in the face trying to wake somebody up.
[01:04:11.643 --> 01:04:13.324]  But you give them one of these powerful films,
[01:04:14.105 --> 01:04:17.526]  And all these films have online bibliography so you can check all the facts in them.
[01:04:19.087 --> 01:04:21.248]  It has a much higher rate of waking somebody up.
[01:04:21.408 --> 01:04:21.668]  Okay.
[01:04:23.849 --> 01:04:26.070]  The health care bill was written by the insurance companies.
[01:04:26.090 --> 01:04:26.930]  That's now come out.
[01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:29.831]  We've had Ron Paul on, Lord Monckton and others to break that down.
[01:04:29.851 --> 01:04:31.872]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, economist.
[01:04:32.172 --> 01:04:33.253]  That's in the subsections.
[01:04:33.293 --> 01:04:33.773]  We've covered it.
[01:04:35.312 --> 01:04:36.313]  This is corporate welfare.
[01:04:36.534 --> 01:04:40.941]  Well now FEMA, that's the shadow government system, is expanding floodplains.
[01:04:40.961 --> 01:04:43.245]  And I was getting a bunch of calls the last two weeks about this.
[01:04:44.627 --> 01:04:48.374]  I know some folks that have a little lake cabin and it is
[01:04:50.373 --> 01:05:05.489]  Just probably 100 yards away from water, 60-70 feet from where the lake has ever flooded, and massive, massive insurance that they've been told, the federal government says you've got to buy, and FEMA underwrites it.
[01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:07.030]  FEMA gets a big cut of it.
[01:05:07.631 --> 01:05:12.996]  And we've got this TV report, a levy official FEMA plans to scam to raise money.
[01:05:13.136 --> 01:05:17.860]  Rob Rash, CEO and Chief Engineer of the Levy District, made his accusation Saturday during a candidate forum.
[01:05:18.181 --> 01:05:22.324]  Rash told candidates that FEMA officials told him the agency owes $20 billion to the U.S.
[01:05:22.344 --> 01:05:26.008]  Treasury and the only way they can get it is through flood insurance premiums.
[01:05:26.528 --> 01:05:30.632]  And so, but it's also the precedent of this being set up
[01:05:31.092 --> 01:05:35.153]  Where they're going to start making people buy flood insurance who are 5,000 feet above sea level.
[01:05:35.193 --> 01:05:38.994]  I mean, this is really happening and it's another form.
[01:05:39.374 --> 01:05:43.315]  It's like all the bills, new ones every year, on your cell phone bill.
[01:05:43.576 --> 01:05:45.996]  Now they want computer service charges for your internet.
[01:05:47.097 --> 01:05:48.897]  Now they want all these other environmental fees.
[01:05:49.237 --> 01:05:55.799]  Just hundreds of new taxes all across the country are coming and it's just destroying us.
[01:05:55.859 --> 01:05:58.580]  So we appreciate Rob Rash for joining us.
[01:05:58.620 --> 01:05:59.140]  Sir, thank you.
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:00.361]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:06:00.421 --> 01:06:01.422]  I appreciate the time.
[01:06:01.802 --> 01:06:02.142]  You bet.
[01:06:02.202 --> 01:06:02.543]  Okay.
[01:06:03.884 --> 01:06:06.907]  I mean, tell us about yourself, what's happened, what FEMA said in these meetings.
[01:06:07.708 --> 01:06:20.259]  Alex, when we met with FEMA in Washington, D.C., they told us point blank that they had $20 billion worth of debt that they had to repay from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and the only way they had to recoup that money was through flood insurance premiums.
[01:06:20.968 --> 01:06:29.330]  And what they are doing, in 2004, the Congress started the Map Modernization Program and directed FEMA to update their maps.
[01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:35.072]  But the update was just to digitize these existing maps for ease of replacement and renewal.
[01:06:35.532 --> 01:06:47.875]  In 2006, FEMA began a Map Modernization Program, or the Midcourse Adjustment, post-Katrina, which incorporated levies and definition of floodplains.
[01:06:47.935 --> 01:06:49.015]  And what FEMA's doing
[01:06:49.528 --> 01:06:59.310]  Is they are redefining floodplains across the country and requiring flood insurance so that they can recoup the money lost through Hurricane Katrina and Rita.
[01:06:59.451 --> 01:07:08.713]  And so what they're doing is areas that have never bought flood insurance in the past are now being at least either strongly recommended or required to purchase flood insurance.
[01:07:09.233 --> 01:07:13.794]  And this will affect 40%, 40% of the country.
[01:07:13.814 --> 01:07:17.155]  There's a 40% chance that you will be caught up in this scam.
[01:07:17.968 --> 01:07:29.018]  The reason that it is a scam is because if you go to any insurance company in the country and buy a flood insurance policy, FEMA underwrites every single one of those policies.
[01:07:29.638 --> 01:07:38.626]  FEMA is setting the rules, FEMA is defining the floodplain, and they are also setting the insurance requirements for the purchase of flood insurance.
[01:07:39.156 --> 01:07:42.658]  And they get a percentage of that money put into a fund, correct?
[01:07:43.079 --> 01:07:45.100]  That is correct.
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.941]  That money will go to the U.S.
[01:07:47.001 --> 01:07:47.482]  Treasurer.
[01:07:47.602 --> 01:07:49.523]  It's supposed to be to go to the U.S.
[01:07:49.563 --> 01:07:51.865]  Treasurer to repay the debt incurred by Katrina.
[01:07:53.446 --> 01:07:58.189]  Now, with the mid-course adjustment, that was all written within the bureaucracy.
[01:07:58.229 --> 01:08:00.090]  That was not mandated by Congress.
[01:08:00.130 --> 01:08:04.493]  The 2004 bill, that modernization program, was mandated by Congress.
[01:08:05.006 --> 01:08:12.668]  The mid-course adjustment was all done within FEMA and the bureaucracy, and that is what incorporated the redefining of floodplains.
[01:08:13.228 --> 01:08:22.451]  And what FEMA's doing is they are completely ignoring the flood control structures that have been constructed the last hundred years across this country.
[01:08:22.891 --> 01:08:29.152]  And if you are affected at all, protected at all, by a man-made structure, you will buy some form of flood insurance.
[01:08:29.572 --> 01:08:32.173]  And it will affect 40% of the population of this country.
[01:08:33.194 --> 01:08:43.601]  So if you live even anywhere near a dam or anywhere near a levee or any type of Army Corps of Engineers program, they're now going to have this expanded tax.
[01:08:43.641 --> 01:08:52.146]  And FEMA, I've also read, but correct me if I'm wrong because I've seen it here and there in the news, that they're also saying we may not allow building in expanded areas now.
[01:08:52.206 --> 01:08:55.609]  And so it's federal jurisdiction over where you can build
[01:08:56.741 --> 01:09:03.006]  What you can do, federal control over the levees districts, over the counties, just a giant scam.
[01:09:03.026 --> 01:09:05.788]  And if they get away with this, the sky's the limit.
[01:09:06.268 --> 01:09:18.078]  Alex, what they're doing right now is that every one of these municipalities across the country that is facing the map modernization or the remapping of their area, they are sending ordinance from FEMA.
[01:09:18.398 --> 01:09:19.919]  And I'll quote you from that ordinance.
[01:09:19.939 --> 01:09:21.741]  This ordinance states that
[01:09:22.521 --> 01:09:33.547]  That they will limit that this municipality, anyone that requires this or adopts this ordinance, will limit any unwise development in floodplains.
[01:09:33.948 --> 01:09:41.752]  Well, who determines what unwise development is and adverse impacts of floodplain development and what FEMA is doing is taking areas
[01:09:42.338 --> 01:09:57.952]  That people have lived and raised families and businesses for hundreds of years and built flood control structures to protect themselves and they're negating these flood control structures and requiring insurance behind them in an effort to limit development.
[01:09:58.559 --> 01:10:03.145]  And this will destroy economic development in numerous areas across the country.
[01:10:03.625 --> 01:10:05.147]  And I'll give you an example.
[01:10:05.588 --> 01:10:10.354]  Collinsworth, Illinois, the federal government and the U.S.
[01:10:10.414 --> 01:10:17.943]  Army Corps of Engineers came in and built a levy system from scratch that exceeded the 500-year level of protection.
[01:10:19.091 --> 01:10:40.509]  Under these new requirements issued by FEMA, these levies no longer meet those requirements and although they passed a hundred year flood in 93 and 97 and protected the people of Collinsville in Illinois, they now are considered a high-risk area and are required to buy the highest amount of flood insurance.
[01:10:40.549 --> 01:10:41.990]  Well, here's another example.
[01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:45.753]  Take areas of Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, areas of Texas.
[01:10:46.574 --> 01:10:51.598]  There's a lot of families and individuals that bought over the last hundred years cheap property.
[01:10:52.679 --> 01:10:54.741]  They're building golf courses, hotels on it.
[01:10:55.321 --> 01:10:57.123]  I mean, you name it, but people own it.
[01:10:58.123 --> 01:11:03.348]  And I've seen articles in different newspapers where now FEMA and others are just saying, look,
[01:11:04.212 --> 01:11:05.412]  You can't build here anymore.
[01:11:05.832 --> 01:11:12.154]  And if people choose to build a beach house that's 20 feet off the ground because they want to be on the beach, that's their business.
[01:11:12.474 --> 01:11:16.715]  And if they don't want to have it insured, they shouldn't be forced to get that insurance.
[01:11:16.895 --> 01:11:18.935]  So this is really tyranny.
[01:11:19.256 --> 01:11:22.476]  And we see where this is leading, just where the sky's the limit.
[01:11:23.276 --> 01:11:23.517]  Right.
[01:11:23.677 --> 01:11:29.538]  And what's going to happen is FEMA is requiring these municipalities to accept this ordinance
[01:11:30.319 --> 01:11:47.948]  Or they will withhold funding for any emergency management, any emergency, whether it be a tornado, whether it be an earthquake, whether it be any type of emergency, they are threatening withholding of funding unless these maps are accepted by the local municipality.
[01:11:48.028 --> 01:11:48.949]  And as part of that,
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:58.787]  They have got to accept floodplain management, which requires everything to be elevated above that, quote, 100-year flood elevation as determined by FEMA.
[01:11:58.927 --> 01:12:03.170]  So basically, this is worse than federalization in violation of the 9th and 10th Amendment.
[01:12:03.511 --> 01:12:08.955]  This is unelected executive branch, FEMA, basically saying, look,
[01:12:10.114 --> 01:12:13.136]  Forty percent of this country, we're now in control of it.
[01:12:13.216 --> 01:12:13.876]  We're the boss.
[01:12:14.176 --> 01:12:15.037]  We run your county.
[01:12:15.697 --> 01:12:16.437]  We run your city.
[01:12:16.477 --> 01:12:17.258]  We run your state.
[01:12:17.598 --> 01:12:18.418]  That is correct.
[01:12:18.478 --> 01:12:20.019]  That is exactly what they're doing.
[01:12:20.139 --> 01:12:30.184]  And they are holding future federal funding for any type of disaster as they're dangling that carrot in front of them.
[01:12:30.204 --> 01:12:35.667]  And let's be clear, they take our state money and on average send about 33 cents back with strings attached.
[01:12:36.868 --> 01:12:37.408]  That's correct.
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:51.009]  I tell you, pretty soon we won't be able to do anything without FEMA's permission, and if they pass this carbon tax law, home inspections, federal zoning laws, it just goes on and on.
[01:12:51.830 --> 01:13:03.099]  I'm getting a lot of feedback on this, and I'm seeing a lot of news articles where local flood managers and people are really upset by this, so it looks like at least some people are becoming aware of what's happened.
[01:13:03.139 --> 01:13:04.100]  Is there any way to stop this?
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:05.641]  There is a way to stop it.
[01:13:05.701 --> 01:13:09.224]  Congress can stop this.
[01:13:09.764 --> 01:13:11.205]  It takes quite a few congressmen.
[01:13:11.225 --> 01:13:12.206]  I'll give you an example.
[01:13:12.246 --> 01:13:19.092]  In 2007, there was a bill that passed through the Senate requiring mandatory flood insurance across the board.
[01:13:19.582 --> 01:13:20.082]  I don't
[01:13:38.374 --> 01:13:44.738]  However, we now have 16 Senators that are against this mandatory flood insurance and what FEMA is doing.
[01:13:45.719 --> 01:13:57.166]  And this letter has been sent to FEMA and several meetings have occurred with FEMA to slow this down through the bureaucracy, but it has to be stopped and it'll have to be stopped through the Congress.
[01:13:57.907 --> 01:14:05.352]  Okay, reading this article from KATV Television, this is out of Truman, Arkansas, it says,
[01:14:07.327 --> 01:14:08.588]  An official at the St.
[01:14:08.648 --> 01:14:16.072]  Francis Levee District says recommendations by the Federal Emergency Management Agency for local landowners to purchase flood insurance are nothing more than a scam.
[01:14:16.152 --> 01:14:27.119]  Rob Rasch, CEO and Chief Engineer of the Levee District, made this accusation Saturday during a candidate forum at Truman attended by several people hoping to win the first district congressional seat.
[01:14:27.739 --> 01:14:28.439]  That is correct.
[01:14:28.459 --> 01:14:33.521]  In a meeting at the Mayflower Hotel with the Mississippi Valley Flood Control Association and FEMA.
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:59.763]  It's very clear and FEMA officials were very clear that the only way that they have to get money is through their flood insurance premiums.
[01:14:59.883 --> 01:15:02.224]  And that is what they are pushing.
[01:15:02.964 --> 01:15:16.228]  They are taking flood control structures that have federal dollars and local dollars and billions of federal dollars and local dollars to protect citizens and have been designed, constructed, and maintained over the last 150 or 200 years
[01:15:18.183 --> 01:15:28.246]  And they're negating them completely on these flood maps and creating a fictitious fear for people around, certainly around our area, for the Mississippi River.
[01:15:28.286 --> 01:15:35.228]  We're a part of the Mississippi River and Tributaries Project, which provides a level of protection that exceeds what FEMA is wanting.
[01:15:35.248 --> 01:15:38.489]  But that's always, I mean, the feds don't want development in many areas.
[01:15:38.509 --> 01:15:39.609]  They want to be able to control it.
[01:15:39.629 --> 01:15:42.190]  It's part of the rewilding project.
[01:15:45.051 --> 01:15:57.141]  I've seen the numbers, I've had a congressman on to cover it, but most of the money that FEMA gets is used for COG, continuity of government, you know, shadow government type stuff.
[01:15:57.181 --> 01:16:01.044]  So we also, I need to understand that a lot of this flood money is going to other stuff.
[01:16:01.704 --> 01:16:14.615]  Right, and I'm not familiar exactly where FEMA's money goes, but I can tell you that the expansion of these floodplains, and the redefining of these floodplains, and the redefining of the risks that actually exist,
[01:16:15.137 --> 01:16:19.820]  We'll put billions of dollars in FEMA's bank account.
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:33.148]  And so this is an expansion of a system that this just clearly is a scam because you have FEMA who is setting the limits, they're setting the standards, and they're the ones requiring it.
[01:16:33.208 --> 01:16:35.849]  So you have all three entities under one roof.
[01:16:36.049 --> 01:16:37.190]  And they're the ones getting the money.
[01:16:37.470 --> 01:16:38.251]  That is correct.
[01:16:39.151 --> 01:16:41.933]  That is correct regardless of where you purchase this flood insurance.
[01:16:42.772 --> 01:16:47.353]  And this will destroy economic development in a number of areas across this country.
[01:16:47.973 --> 01:16:48.873]  And I want to read you something.
[01:16:48.893 --> 01:16:51.894]  Well, that's where everybody wants to live is on a river or a lake.
[01:16:52.474 --> 01:16:53.034]  Absolutely.
[01:16:53.535 --> 01:16:54.095]  Absolutely.
[01:16:54.475 --> 01:16:58.536]  This is all part of floodplain management that was put out.
[01:16:58.576 --> 01:17:04.337]  This is from an excerpt out of the 93 flood report which was written
[01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:05.850]  I don't know.
[01:17:27.471 --> 01:17:28.131]  Let's be clear.
[01:17:28.151 --> 01:17:30.553]  Let's come back and talk more about that in the final segment.
[01:17:30.893 --> 01:17:35.497]  That is so massive, a total takeover, and they're saying, we don't want you living here.
[01:17:36.038 --> 01:17:43.905]  And it's like the Wetlands Act, where a pool, a puddle on your ranch, now you can't run cattle there.
[01:17:44.185 --> 01:17:45.005]  They tried that.
[01:17:45.706 --> 01:17:47.528]  We finally defeated most of that.
[01:17:47.868 --> 01:17:49.970]  It's a giant power grab.
[01:17:50.170 --> 01:17:55.894]  Forty percent of the country, your new landlord, your new boss is FEMA if we don't beat this.
[01:17:55.914 --> 01:17:56.515]  Stay there, sir.

[01:19:01.272 --> 01:19:03.495]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:19:03.595 --> 01:19:06.419]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:19:06.819 --> 01:19:11.565]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:19:11.926 --> 01:19:16.111]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:19:16.411 --> 01:19:18.773]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:19:18.873 --> 01:19:21.294]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:19:21.314 --> 01:19:24.216]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:19:24.556 --> 01:19:32.161]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:37.783]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:19:37.903 --> 01:19:40.664]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:19:40.744 --> 01:19:44.165]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:19:44.425 --> 01:19:45.365]  And I got news for you.
[01:19:45.505 --> 01:19:46.806]  You're everyone else.

[01:20:04.668 --> 01:20:07.189]  Made in the USA, blue jeans.
[01:20:07.589 --> 01:20:09.270]  Like you wore as a kid.
[01:20:09.610 --> 01:20:10.050]  Remember?
[01:20:10.490 --> 01:20:31.378]  There's a place down in Tennessee Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit They put a diamond gusset in the crotch Where you need it most
[01:20:32.091 --> 01:20:38.174]  We're good old-fashioned comfort.

[01:20:40.055 --> 01:20:41.335]  Every stitch guaranteed.
[01:20:41.556 --> 01:20:44.577]  In our Defender motorcycle jean comes Kevlar reinforced.
[01:20:44.817 --> 01:20:47.278]  See them at G-U-S-S-E-T dot com.
[01:20:47.358 --> 01:20:48.679]  That's Gusset dot com.
[01:20:48.799 --> 01:20:49.259]  Or call 888-848-7738.
[01:20:49.279 --> 01:20:49.559]  That's 888-848-7738.
[01:20:49.579 --> 01:20:50.760]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:51.140]  Others don't.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:08.045]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:21:08.646 --> 01:21:11.669]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:12.389 --> 01:21:15.292]  That's right, there's a war on for your mind.
[01:21:15.312 --> 01:21:22.458]  We're talking to Bob Rash, and he is a Chief Engineer of the Levee District in his area of Arkansas.
[01:21:24.690 --> 01:21:40.337]  Now, again, I'm no expert on this, but I've read over it over the years, and correct me if I'm wrong, until a few decades ago, you really couldn't get flood insurance from a private company, private insurance company, if you were in danger of flooding and you just needed to build your house and have it on stilts and know that.
[01:21:40.357 --> 01:21:41.017]  You know, it's freedom.
[01:21:41.057 --> 01:21:41.578]  It's America.
[01:21:42.398 --> 01:21:54.723]  But now, FEMA underwrites it, so basically you just go into an insurance company, they're like a broker, or like a title company when you buy a house, and they get a little piece of it and it goes to FEMA, and then the government's saying, you've got to buy this from us.
[01:21:55.464 --> 01:21:56.344]  This is mafia.
[01:21:57.424 --> 01:22:02.387]  Well, and just so you know, on a $100,000 home, you're going to spend about $1,200 a year.
[01:22:02.407 --> 01:22:05.908]  On a quarter of a million dollar home, you're going to spend about $2,600 a year per person.
[01:22:08.890 --> 01:22:13.191]  And so this is being used as a deterrent.
[01:22:13.251 --> 01:22:14.811]  It's a federal property tax.
[01:22:14.931 --> 01:22:15.611]  That's correct.
[01:22:15.991 --> 01:22:16.912]  A targeted tax.
[01:22:17.792 --> 01:22:18.632]  It's all that it is.
[01:22:18.732 --> 01:22:24.413]  It's a targeted tax and FEMA is utilizing it because they underwrite the flood insurance policies.
[01:22:24.853 --> 01:22:33.475]  They are masking it with a warning people of the risk and they are overstating every risk that they place on these flood maps in an effort to recoup money.
[01:22:35.043 --> 01:22:35.523]  Amazing.
[01:22:35.563 --> 01:22:43.148]  I mean, like I said earlier, I know people who are up on hilltops and they're getting these letters in Travis County saying, look, your insurance is going up.
[01:22:43.468 --> 01:22:43.708]  Right.
[01:22:44.849 --> 01:22:47.350]  And that will happen throughout this country, Alex.
[01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:55.435]  There are a number, as I said, there will be 40% of the population of this country that will be affected by this.
[01:22:55.935 --> 01:22:59.177]  And the federal government, FEMA, is not warning people of
[01:23:00.198 --> 01:23:08.548]  They're not warning people of earthquakes, they're not warning people of wind damage, they're not warning people of tornadoes, because they don't underwrite insurance policies for those items.
[01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:16.057]  They're warning people of a fictitious risk of flooding in areas that don't need to be required to buy flood insurance.
[01:23:18.203 --> 01:23:27.172]  Well, going back to the point in closing that you tried to make as we hit that break, this is all based, you said, on this 93 document, and I've seen that document before.
[01:23:27.232 --> 01:23:33.939]  Go back over that document where they're saying that the real move is to basically force people out of these areas.
[01:23:34.179 --> 01:23:34.940]  That is correct.
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:40.306]  The 93 flood report, which is named Sharing the Challenge,
[01:23:41.226 --> 01:23:57.273]  It recommends people move out of designated areas, which FEMA now has begun designating these areas, but they use this as a deterrent for economic development or for any type of development in these, quote, floodplains.
[01:23:58.193 --> 01:24:02.195]  However, the problem is that FEMA is redefining these floodplains.
[01:24:02.945 --> 01:24:09.768]  They're redefining floodplains and ignoring improvements that have been made through the years with both federal money and local money.
[01:24:10.289 --> 01:24:14.531]  And they are not acknowledging these flood control structures.
[01:24:14.991 --> 01:24:21.954]  And they are requiring areas, they are renaming areas a floodplain and requiring flood insurance because of it.
[01:24:22.374 --> 01:24:27.917]  And it is written into this, into the 21st century and sharing the challenge.
[01:24:30.339 --> 01:24:39.860]  Uh, in the 93 flood report, and it states very clearly to use strict use regulations by communities to stop unwise development.
[01:24:40.421 --> 01:24:45.505]  The problem is, is that FEMA is defining these unwise developmental areas.
[01:24:45.625 --> 01:24:47.606]  No, this isn't even federal tyranny.
[01:24:47.626 --> 01:24:51.569]  This is just an agency out of control, and they're taking over everything.
[01:24:51.589 --> 01:24:52.590]  They're training the police.
[01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:55.131]  This is a criminal operation.
[01:24:55.352 --> 01:24:57.913]  We appreciate your courage and what you've been doing, sir.
[01:24:58.314 --> 01:24:58.894]  God bless you.
[01:24:59.134 --> 01:25:01.636]  Thank you very much, Alex, and I appreciate you.
[01:25:01.856 --> 01:25:02.637]  We appreciate you.
[01:25:03.177 --> 01:25:04.578]  Well, there he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:06.019 --> 01:25:07.961]  And he was at a candidate forum for Congress, people.
[01:25:08.001 --> 01:25:08.962]  He's not running for Congress.
[01:25:09.342 --> 01:25:12.945]  We need people like Mr. Rash to run for Congress.
[01:25:13.585 --> 01:25:14.866]  We've got to get control of FEMA.
[01:25:14.967 --> 01:25:15.747]  I mean, come on.
[01:25:16.007 --> 01:25:18.389]  That's why I made the film, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[01:25:19.110 --> 01:25:20.171]  We cover it all in here.
[01:25:20.211 --> 01:25:22.353]  I mean, this is the shadow government.
[01:25:23.479 --> 01:25:26.701]  Coming out of the shadows and just taking over everything.
[01:25:27.001 --> 01:25:31.544]  This is the group merging the military and police and training the military for gun confiscation.
[01:25:31.984 --> 01:25:33.565]  This is the group building the FEMA camps.
[01:25:34.106 --> 01:25:36.687]  This is the group saying they're going to force you out of your houses.
[01:25:37.288 --> 01:25:37.988]  We'll be right back.

[01:26:52.249 --> 01:26:54.170]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:26:54.630 --> 01:26:57.432]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:27:05.399 --> 01:27:11.163]  All right, I'm going to attempt and probably succeed in this hour to at least take the full board of calls we've got.
[01:27:11.544 --> 01:27:15.226]  But I do want to get into the myth of overpopulation, explain what's happening.
[01:27:15.807 --> 01:27:20.470]  I then want to get into how race-based politics is being used to divide and conquer this society.
[01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:22.272]  I meant to cover this yesterday, didn't get to it.
[01:27:22.552 --> 01:27:26.375]  We will cover it in this hour of the broadcast today.
[01:27:27.708 --> 01:27:28.809]  Some of the other news coming up.
[01:27:28.929 --> 01:27:32.490]  Senator Lieberman says deny citizenship to suspected terrorists.
[01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:38.773]  It's a Kurt Nemo story that links in to the New York Times at GCNlive.com.
[01:27:39.113 --> 01:27:40.774]  That's GCNlive.com if you want to read this.
[01:27:41.074 --> 01:27:44.876]  Senator Lieberman denies citizenship to suspected terrorists.
[01:27:46.057 --> 01:27:47.317]  Well, that means the American people.
[01:27:47.658 --> 01:27:56.702]  That's like... Well, I'll cover it after I take some calls, but that's like Rahm Emanuel saying, if we think maybe you could possibly be a terrorist, that's a quote,
[01:27:57.654 --> 01:28:02.657]  If we think possibly, maybe you could be possibly a terrorist, then you'll be denied the right to own guns.
[01:28:02.837 --> 01:28:03.678]  No judge, no jury.
[01:28:04.078 --> 01:28:05.059]  No fly, no buy.
[01:28:05.119 --> 01:28:06.419]  You're on a no-fly list, no buy.
[01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:12.183]  I mean, they're really getting rid of our system of law and checks and balances in this country, and it's just incredible.
[01:28:12.903 --> 01:28:14.585]  Let's go to Matt in Maryland.
[01:28:14.625 --> 01:28:15.365]  Matt, you're on the air.
[01:28:15.405 --> 01:28:15.745]  Go ahead.
[01:28:15.765 --> 01:28:17.126]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:28:17.446 --> 01:28:18.287]  I'm all right, my friend.
[01:28:18.307 --> 01:28:19.968]  It's good talking to you.
[01:28:20.008 --> 01:28:23.250]  Hey, I just want to let you know your work is just astounding.
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:28.423]  And everything you're doing seems to be working as far as my office is concerned.
[01:28:28.463 --> 01:28:35.229]  We've woken three people up, well, awakened, I should say, three people up at work just this week alone.
[01:28:35.389 --> 01:28:36.010]  Great job.
[01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:39.072]  And it's working, it's paying off, you know.
[01:28:39.793 --> 01:28:46.018]  I've actually got one of them convinced, you know, that, hey, this is the truth, this is the way it's working, and it's unfortunate.
[01:28:46.058 --> 01:28:47.419]  But I mean, listen, listen.
[01:28:47.639 --> 01:28:51.923]  Fifteen years ago when I got on air and others were talking, it wasn't all out in the open.
[01:28:52.043 --> 01:28:53.164]  It's out in the open now.
[01:28:54.807 --> 01:28:55.207]  Certainly.
[01:28:56.107 --> 01:29:04.630]  And with Barry Satoro, our wonderful friend, our leader, that's a name that a lot of people at the office just had no clue about.
[01:29:05.450 --> 01:29:08.951]  No perception that, hey, this is a giant lie.
[01:29:09.851 --> 01:29:14.472]  A giant lie that the name Barack Obama, do you even know what it means in Aramaic?
[01:29:15.833 --> 01:29:16.953]  Have you heard that, Alex?
[01:29:17.593 --> 01:29:18.453]  I've read it before.
[01:29:18.473 --> 01:29:19.414]  I'll refresh my memory.
[01:29:20.614 --> 01:29:24.535]  In Aramaic, Barak means from the height.
[01:29:25.874 --> 01:29:26.935]  Or lightning, I should say.
[01:29:26.975 --> 01:29:27.536]  I apologize.
[01:29:27.596 --> 01:29:28.176]  It's lightning.
[01:29:28.416 --> 01:29:28.797]  Zeus!
[01:29:30.038 --> 01:29:30.438]  Yes.
[01:29:30.778 --> 01:29:35.463]  Where Obama, in Aramaic, means from the heights.
[01:29:35.683 --> 01:29:44.751]  Now, if you read Isaiah, the direct reference to Satan is lightning from the heights.
[01:29:46.212 --> 01:29:55.944]  That's right, and that's why the runic in Germanic tribes, you know, lightning falling from the sky, you know, the twin lightning bolts.
[01:29:56.424 --> 01:29:57.445]  I'll have to look that up.
[01:29:57.465 --> 01:30:04.854]  I had remembered seeing that before, but that's just incredible that he would choose the fake name, lightning from the heights.
[01:30:06.055 --> 01:30:08.376]  But regardless, we know his real name is Barry Sotaro.
[01:30:08.676 --> 01:30:10.236]  I mean, that was being talked about two years ago.
[01:30:10.296 --> 01:30:11.037]  It's now admitted.
[01:30:11.357 --> 01:30:12.757]  And he was an Indonesian citizen.
[01:30:13.137 --> 01:30:13.657]  Game over.
[01:30:13.697 --> 01:30:17.758]  But now, his wife, in clip after clip, says we went back to his home country.
[01:30:18.058 --> 01:30:18.799]  He's Kenyan.
[01:30:19.099 --> 01:30:19.739]  We went back.
[01:30:19.779 --> 01:30:21.079]  And then he makes jokes about it.
[01:30:21.639 --> 01:30:25.040]  And says, yeah, my approval rating's low here, but not in the country of my birth.
[01:30:26.121 --> 01:30:27.021]  And everybody laughs.
[01:30:27.061 --> 01:30:29.322]  I mean, this is flaunting this.
[01:30:29.762 --> 01:30:31.222]  And again, it sets a precedent.
[01:30:31.602 --> 01:30:33.803]  First president to be UN Secretary.
[01:30:34.878 --> 01:30:41.779]  uh... of the security council first uh... yeah i mean it's just amazing what do we know about this guy
[01:30:43.188 --> 01:30:46.409]  But notice how the bigger the lie, as Hitler said, the more they'll buy it.
[01:30:46.749 --> 01:30:56.331]  Who would imagine that they would take somebody who was a foreigner, and somebody who was clearly with a fake name, and make him the president?
[01:30:56.411 --> 01:30:57.912]  It's just so big.
[01:30:58.432 --> 01:31:05.854]  And it may have something to do with it coming out later, and then they'll have to change the 22nd Amendment so Schwarzenegger can be president.
[01:31:05.874 --> 01:31:07.214]  There you go.
[01:31:07.434 --> 01:31:10.875]  And that's what I was thinking about earlier when you were discussing just that.
[01:31:11.604 --> 01:31:14.086]  Well, I was watching before you came on today.
[01:31:14.866 --> 01:31:17.288]  And then one more thing, and I don't mean to take up all your time.
[01:31:17.588 --> 01:31:19.430]  This terrorist attempt in New York.
[01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:21.611]  Yes.
[01:31:22.332 --> 01:31:26.335]  It's a little odd now that, you know, at first we couldn't find out who was responsible for this.
[01:31:26.775 --> 01:31:28.356]  That way they could just blame everybody.
[01:31:28.436 --> 01:31:29.637]  All the tea parties, yeah.
[01:31:30.197 --> 01:31:34.521]  And now, I guess, well, we've noticed that the truth movement seems to be gaining power.
[01:31:34.581 --> 01:31:39.104]  They seem to be doing a great job at opening people up, waking them up.
[01:31:40.044 --> 01:31:45.872]  Why don't we just blame it back on Al-Qaeda to validate the fact that it was all Al-Qaeda to begin with?
[01:31:46.912 --> 01:31:49.333]  Well, we know that they were clearly running a drill.
[01:31:49.493 --> 01:31:52.253]  Eyewitnesses and others, not just the cop, are saying this.
[01:31:52.653 --> 01:31:57.815]  We need to investigate this further, because they run drills to cover up the staged terror attack every time.
[01:31:57.875 --> 01:31:58.615]  We'll be right back.
[01:31:59.095 --> 01:32:01.375]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:32:01.395 --> 01:32:03.696]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:32:03.796 --> 01:32:06.577]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:32:06.997 --> 01:32:11.758]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:32:12.098 --> 01:32:16.299]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:32:16.619 --> 01:32:18.942]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:32:18.962 --> 01:32:21.485]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:32:21.505 --> 01:32:24.408]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:32:24.768 --> 01:32:32.357]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:32:32.699 --> 01:32:37.944]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:32:38.084 --> 01:32:40.366]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:32:40.406 --> 01:32:44.369]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:32:44.630 --> 01:32:45.550]  And I got news for you.
[01:32:45.691 --> 01:32:47.012]  You're everyone else.
[01:32:47.032 --> 01:32:48.053]  Invisible Empire.

[01:32:59.022 --> 01:33:00.283]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:33:00.323 --> 01:33:05.685]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:33:05.926 --> 01:33:10.548]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:33:10.928 --> 01:33:11.328]  It's true.
[01:33:11.408 --> 01:33:15.971]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:33:16.511 --> 01:33:21.214]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:33:21.735 --> 01:33:23.656]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:33:24.036 --> 01:33:28.659]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:33:28.839 --> 01:33:29.740]  And here's the best part.
[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:32.742]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:33:33.022 --> 01:33:36.344]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:33:36.665 --> 01:33:39.506]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:33:39.847 --> 01:33:41.728]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[01:33:49.593 --> 01:33:55.376]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:33:55.696 --> 01:33:58.137]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:33:59.458 --> 01:34:01.659]  Max, what did you do with the remote?
[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:03.380]  Now what am I going to do?
[01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:05.541]  I guess I can go online to find a new one.
[01:34:05.942 --> 01:34:06.302]  Okay.

[01:34:16.832 --> 01:34:22.175]  Wow, they have my original remote and an exact replacement that doesn't need programming.

[01:35:16.615 --> 01:35:20.660]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:35:23.951 --> 01:35:25.113]  Give me a document, Tim.
[01:35:25.433 --> 01:35:25.734]  Shot.
[01:35:25.794 --> 01:35:26.635]  Boys, thank you.
[01:35:26.655 --> 01:35:35.029]  For those watching us live at PrisonPlanet.tv, not just listening on the AM and FM dial, Global Shorewave Satellite, the Internet, at Infowars.com and XM Radio.
[01:35:39.184 --> 01:36:03.934]  I was on my Facebook this morning, one of our Facebook accounts, Alexander Emmerich Jones account is the name of it, and I was aware of the Population Research Institute and their great work, but they have produced three animated videos, and we're going to play those right now for everybody that is patiently
[01:36:05.354 --> 01:36:06.735]  tuned in to see this information.
[01:36:07.876 --> 01:36:20.783]  But you can also just go up to our Facebook account and the videos are posted at the top or you can simply, well I've had Kurt Nemo also post these at mfallwars.com and write an article.
[01:36:21.974 --> 01:36:35.205]  about them, and this dovetails into the government and the social engineers trying to implement race war, not just here in the United States, but all over the planet, as a tool to divide and conquer the populations against each other.
[01:36:35.245 --> 01:36:47.555]  Now listen, if you go to the UN's own official documents, they say that in the next 20 years, this piece says 30, they're being conservative, that the Earth's population will stabilize between 8 and 9 billion people.
[01:36:49.571 --> 01:36:50.372]  That's just a fact.
[01:36:50.912 --> 01:37:01.640]  And once a country industrializes, you see a 1.5 or lower population replacement rate.
[01:37:02.340 --> 01:37:08.285]  Now that means for every two parents, for every two people that are born, not all of them even become parents.
[01:37:09.986 --> 01:37:17.652]  But to just replace the population, let's say you have 300 million Americans but you don't have immigration, hypothetically,
[01:37:18.618 --> 01:37:27.444]  To have 300 million Americans in the next generation, the generation after that, you need to have 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, depending on the numbers you look at.
[01:37:27.744 --> 01:37:29.706]  So you need to have more than two people.
[01:37:34.517 --> 01:37:39.720]  Being born to the average family, to be able to just keep the numbers we've got.
[01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:44.623]  Now, Japan's 1.2, Italy is 1.3 and dropping.
[01:37:45.864 --> 01:37:54.109]  If this continues in less than a decade, they say Japan won't even be having one child for every two Japanese.
[01:37:54.349 --> 01:37:58.091]  And that goes all the way down to extinction within 300 years.
[01:37:58.151 --> 01:37:58.851]  No more Japanese.
[01:38:02.850 --> 01:38:03.812]  No more Italians.
[01:38:04.513 --> 01:38:05.435]  No more Germans.
[01:38:06.537 --> 01:38:09.863]  Now, America has gone from 260-something million 30 years ago to 310 million now.
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:19.962]  But the United States has a replacement rate of about 1.5 of Americans that were already here.
[01:38:19.982 --> 01:38:22.142]  Doesn't matter if you're black, white, Hispanic, Asian.
[01:38:22.483 --> 01:38:25.543]  The only reason our population is growing is because they're bringing in new people.
[01:38:25.903 --> 01:38:30.005]  And we've had more than 50 million abortions since 1973 with Roe v. Wade.
[01:38:30.545 --> 01:38:34.266]  And that's just about the number of legals and illegals that have been brought in since then.
[01:38:34.286 --> 01:38:38.707]  And the government says, well, we've got to have these people to replace because we've killed our workforce.
[01:38:38.987 --> 01:38:40.727]  We've killed America!
[01:38:41.048 --> 01:38:42.008]  The death of the West!
[01:38:42.648 --> 01:38:44.049]  I mean, this is really happening.
[01:38:45.190 --> 01:38:47.172]  And, you know, I talk about this all the time.
[01:38:48.152 --> 01:38:49.974]  You see all these black activists.
[01:38:49.994 --> 01:38:58.381]  In fact, I saw it last night on CNN, where a Hollywood actress, Sandra Bullock, adopted a poor, homeless black baby.
[01:38:59.201 --> 01:39:02.724]  And the black groups, a bunch of them came out and said, what's this white woman want a black kid for?
[01:39:02.764 --> 01:39:04.305]  Why don't you get a white kid?
[01:39:04.565 --> 01:39:05.947]  You're just doing this to act liberal.
[01:39:06.912 --> 01:39:08.933]  That's how sick these groups are.
[01:39:09.294 --> 01:39:20.561]  You've got 52, last year, some years it's even higher, 52% of black people on average not being born since Roe v. Wade.
[01:39:20.681 --> 01:39:27.186]  More than half the black people that would exist in the United States don't exist.
[01:39:29.465 --> 01:39:31.426]  That's why the black population is basically stable.
[01:39:31.846 --> 01:39:44.354]  The eugenics program of saying it's liberal to have abortions, pushing them on black people, pushing them on other minorities, have been successful by the globalists in these depressed economic areas.
[01:39:45.074 --> 01:40:04.923]  Now, regardless of where you stand on that, how sickening is it that the black media owned by big corporations is so big on keeping everyone divided that you will never hear them talk about what good folks like the people that run blackgenocide.com are exposing.
[01:40:05.503 --> 01:40:06.223]  And it is a fact.
[01:40:06.403 --> 01:40:08.044]  Over 50% of black people are not born.
[01:40:08.504 --> 01:40:11.185]  And then how dare somebody actually adopt that baby?
[01:40:11.245 --> 01:40:12.726]  It'd be better that baby just dead.
[01:40:14.042 --> 01:40:20.167]  Now that's the death culture that Margaret Sanger and the Rockefellers and the New World Order have sold the black community.
[01:40:20.587 --> 01:40:23.049]  Now they're moving into all communities.
[01:40:23.089 --> 01:40:34.037]  In fact, right here is a CNN report where they came out a couple weeks ago on Earth Day and said
[01:40:37.028 --> 01:40:39.410]  We need to have a one-child policy in the United States.
[01:40:40.370 --> 01:40:47.215]  At the Copenhagen Treaty last year in December, they officially, the UN, called for a global one-child policy.
[01:40:47.255 --> 01:40:56.661]  Now, if you have a global one-child policy, that will more than reduce the population within one generation of half of the Earth's population.
[01:40:57.597 --> 01:40:57.937]  Okay.
[01:40:58.418 --> 01:41:07.405]  Now they sell all these myths that there's too many people, we're going to have a hundred billion people on the planet when the UN doesn't even say that, humans are killing everything, on and on and on.
[01:41:07.765 --> 01:41:14.651]  But if you industrialize the third world, every nation that has become industrialized stops having as many children.
[01:41:15.672 --> 01:41:20.836]  Because this modern industrialized system is run by eugenicists where they're targeting the population.
[01:41:22.177 --> 01:41:25.840]  But I wanted to play some videos here
[01:41:26.937 --> 01:41:34.720]  Or folks, that were put out by the Population Research Institute, overpopulationmyth.com.
[01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:36.660]  And again, this is also up on infowars.com.
[01:41:36.900 --> 01:41:38.081]  But here, I found those articles.
[01:41:38.621 --> 01:41:43.963]  Here's Time Magazine, with a report on reducing the population.
[01:41:44.263 --> 01:41:44.923]  Here's CNN.
[01:41:44.983 --> 01:41:46.864]  In fact, give me a document cam shot, please.
[01:41:47.464 --> 01:41:48.644]  I want to go through these for folks.
[01:41:49.425 --> 01:41:51.465]  Here's a Times of London article first.
[01:41:52.746 --> 01:41:56.407]  Doctor sterilize Uzbek women by stealth.
[01:42:00.148 --> 01:42:09.451]  When her baby died soon after delivery, and it mentions the woman's name, the 28-year-old poor farmer's wife longed to be pregnant again.
[01:42:09.852 --> 01:42:15.454]  After months of trying, she and her husband visited a doctor who told her she could never have another child because she had been sterilized.
[01:42:15.874 --> 01:42:18.935]  And then it talks about how the government is involved in a U.N.
[01:42:19.015 --> 01:42:21.216]  program getting aid loan.
[01:42:21.456 --> 01:42:23.157]  This is under State Department Morandum 200 with Kissinger.
[01:42:24.637 --> 01:42:40.809]  Where if these countries in India, and Peru, and Nigeria, and countless other third world nations, they don't get their IMF and World Bank money, kind of like the states don't get their highway funds if they don't accept national ID cards, but illegals are exempt.
[01:42:41.389 --> 01:42:45.492]  Or, FEMA just comes in and says, we own 40% of the land now, you gotta pay us a
[01:42:48.254 --> 01:42:51.242]  Federal property tax is basically what it is.
[01:42:51.462 --> 01:42:54.670]  What we just covered last hour for flood insurance that they make you buy.
[01:42:55.748 --> 01:43:11.374]  Well, when you've got the global government above you, they tell your government, you're not going to get the federal global money from the global federal private corporate banking structure, the global system, the New World Order, the global governance they're openly talking about, unless you sterilize half your women.
[01:43:12.094 --> 01:43:16.696]  And it was George Bush Senior, before he was a CIA director, before he was a U.S.
[01:43:16.736 --> 01:43:24.639]  ambassador to China, and he got China to agree to this, the one-child policy, who orchestrated, and federal documents have been released, we cover it in my film Endgame,
[01:43:25.816 --> 01:43:33.121]  That on Indian reservations, they sterilized, in a two-year period, 44% of the women.
[01:43:34.962 --> 01:43:38.865]  The women would go in to have dental work done at the federal office.
[01:43:38.905 --> 01:43:45.309]  They'd hit them with knockout chemicals, or they'd shoot them up, and they'd tie their tips.
[01:43:46.230 --> 01:43:55.296]  Well, here it is in the Times of London, Uzbek women sterilized by stealth, and you can read all about it and how the women didn't even know this had been done to them.
[01:43:56.101 --> 01:44:03.506]  And we've caught them in Thailand and other places where the government goes into the poor areas and actually kills the babies.
[01:44:03.866 --> 01:44:06.248]  They give them special vaccines that then kill the babies.
[01:44:06.668 --> 01:44:10.551]  And the whole village who's pregnant, you know, the women who are pregnant in the village, they'll all lose their babies.
[01:44:10.931 --> 01:44:12.932]  And I would guess they probably killed her baby as well.
[01:44:12.972 --> 01:44:17.415]  You notice the baby died and then suddenly she was sterilized and the government admits they sterilized her.
[01:44:18.136 --> 01:44:18.896]  Here's another one.
[01:44:19.317 --> 01:44:20.317]  This is Sky Television.
[01:44:20.337 --> 01:44:21.398]  That's Fox News in England.
[01:44:21.758 --> 01:44:25.281]  China to sterilize 10,000 to curb births in just one
[01:44:26.041 --> 01:44:32.963]  Province alone, women who've had already one child are to be picked up by police and to be forcibly sterilized.
[01:44:33.044 --> 01:44:33.464]  There you go.
[01:44:33.524 --> 01:44:38.706]  Just to give you an example of the policy they want here in the United States.
[01:44:39.386 --> 01:44:39.986]  Here's another one.
[01:44:40.626 --> 01:44:42.067]  How green is your love life?
[01:44:42.107 --> 01:44:42.267]  CNN.
[01:44:44.076 --> 01:44:49.961]  And it says, drive a hybrid car, eat organic, and then it says, or implement a one-child policy.
[01:44:50.641 --> 01:45:01.210]  They just slip that in and tell us sex is bad, having kids are bad, and you've got all these pundits on television, I know you've probably seen it, saying we only need to have one child in America.
[01:45:01.470 --> 01:45:08.196]  We have Al Gore calling for this, and you should only have a 2,000 square foot house max, but he's got more than nine houses.
[01:45:08.636 --> 01:45:11.578]  One of them 22,000 square feet, one 9,000 square feet.
[01:45:11.598 --> 01:45:16.421]  He's got two homes in California on the beach, but he says the water is going to rise and flood it.
[01:45:16.682 --> 01:45:18.643]  Just a complete criminal liar.
[01:45:20.524 --> 01:45:25.908]  So that's just some of the news there that I wanted to cover, but now let's go ahead
[01:45:27.159 --> 01:45:29.821]  Well, we're going to go to break and then I'll play these clips when we come back.
[01:45:29.841 --> 01:45:36.305]  We're going to play three different video animation clips, but the audio is also informative for radio listeners.
[01:45:37.225 --> 01:45:39.226]  And food, there's a lot of it.
[01:45:39.266 --> 01:45:40.547]  That's the second clip we're going to play.
[01:45:41.187 --> 01:45:43.889]  We're also going to play kids, stable population, 2.1.
[01:45:44.209 --> 01:45:49.192]  And we're also going to play overpopulation, the making of a myth.
[01:45:49.593 --> 01:45:54.856]  So we're going to come back and play these, and then I'm going to dovetail that into
[01:45:56.738 --> 01:46:07.465]  How State Department Memorandum 200 said, if the governments don't sterilize their women, we'll just start wars with their neighbors or fund guerrilla groups.
[01:46:07.605 --> 01:46:08.565]  That'll kill people.
[01:46:09.065 --> 01:46:11.127]  Or we'll just cut off their food supply.
[01:46:11.567 --> 01:46:18.491]  And we know the GMO crops in India and other places have resulted in hundreds of thousands of people dying, tens of thousands committing suicide because there's no money.
[01:46:19.192 --> 01:46:22.414]  Because they bring in GMO crops, then they can't get seeds the next year.
[01:46:22.994 --> 01:46:23.734]  It's destroyed.
[01:46:23.754 --> 01:46:25.736]  The chemicals they've used are poisoning the people.
[01:46:26.636 --> 01:46:39.419]  That's why, it's a scientific dictatorship, and that's why in every major study, all the major GMO crops that have been approved have the side effect of sterilizing mammals, or reducing fertility bare minimum.
[01:46:40.099 --> 01:46:47.521]  And so, you're eating GMO food right now in the West, the honeybees eat it and die, and you're wondering why you can't have children at 25.
[01:46:48.181 --> 01:46:51.802]  You've been hit and hit hard by a chemical biological weapons cocktail.
[01:46:51.822 --> 01:46:52.382]  We'll be right back.
[01:47:00.109 --> 01:47:00.930]  Gold isn't for you?
[01:47:01.131 --> 01:47:06.458]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[01:47:06.658 --> 01:47:07.079]  I get it.
[01:47:07.199 --> 01:47:16.572]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[01:47:16.812 --> 01:47:17.992]  That's not what's happening.
[01:47:18.213 --> 01:47:26.476]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[01:47:26.696 --> 01:47:29.957]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[01:47:30.077 --> 01:47:34.179]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[01:47:34.359 --> 01:47:35.919]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[01:47:35.959 --> 01:47:39.181]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[01:47:39.361 --> 01:47:43.542]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[01:47:43.722 --> 01:47:44.463]  You should, too.
[01:47:44.643 --> 01:47:45.563]  Find out what they know.
[01:47:45.763 --> 01:47:49.066]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.

[01:47:49.146 --> 01:47:49.427]  800-686-2237.
[01:47:49.487 --> 01:47:49.667]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:47:59.418 --> 01:48:00.518]  Are you prepared?
[01:48:00.798 --> 01:48:02.879]  Well, you need to be hardcore prepared.
[01:48:03.099 --> 01:48:04.159]  There is a difference.
[01:48:04.479 --> 01:48:10.080]  To be hardcore prepared, equip yourself with the latest survival gear available at tacktowngear.com.

[01:49:00.985 --> 01:49:02.767]  And you're subject to other police action.
[01:49:03.528 --> 01:49:04.449]  Tyranny is here.
[01:49:04.789 --> 01:49:08.373]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:49:08.413 --> 01:49:10.935]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:49:10.955 --> 01:49:16.401]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:49:16.822 --> 01:49:23.028]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:49:23.488 --> 01:49:29.010]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:49:29.431 --> 01:49:33.132]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:49:33.632 --> 01:49:37.674]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:49:37.914 --> 01:49:43.476]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:49:43.876 --> 01:49:46.838]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:49:47.418 --> 01:49:48.858]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:49:49.399 --> 01:49:49.839]  It's here.

[01:49:58.604 --> 01:50:00.446]  Hi, this is Steve Schenke, Foods Direct.
[01:50:00.706 --> 01:50:05.951]  We have stopped taking orders for the Buy 3 Get 1 Free program and have started production.
[01:50:06.131 --> 01:50:07.172]  Congratulations!
[01:50:07.452 --> 01:50:13.557]  Your choice to participate in the production of your food supply by pre-ordering will prove very wise.
[01:50:13.918 --> 01:50:18.662]  Shipments will begin the end of March and will be sent in the order that they were received.
[01:50:18.962 --> 01:50:19.843]  Now something fun.
[01:50:20.103 --> 01:50:20.864]  It's springtime!
[01:50:21.024 --> 01:50:28.752]  We all know that garden seeds aren't really a food supply, but they're a great supplement to your food reserve if you have the time and place to garden.
[01:50:28.952 --> 01:50:29.693]  Here's the plan.
[01:50:29.853 --> 01:50:38.422]  When you add a one-month Superfood Spring Pack to your food storage, we'll send you that garden of non-hybrid seeds absolutely free.
[01:50:38.762 --> 01:50:40.644]  Order now while the free seeds last.
[01:50:41.085 --> 01:50:41.405]  Call 800-409-5662.
[01:50:47.693 --> 01:50:51.617]  Get a real supply of food to eat while you wait for your supplemental garden to grow.
[01:50:51.738 --> 01:50:52.038]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:51:09.827 --> 01:51:19.171]  Okay, let's go to this video piece breaking down that you need to have 2.1 children per family to just heat the population.
[01:51:19.732 --> 01:51:25.294]  And the entire West, including Japan, every industrialized nation, is not having anywhere near that.
[01:51:25.394 --> 01:51:26.955]  We are dying.
[01:51:27.535 --> 01:51:32.199]  Ladies and gentlemen, and it's in the West where they're really teaching people not to have children.
[01:51:32.399 --> 01:51:33.000]  Here's the clip.
[01:51:33.220 --> 01:51:40.827]  From the time of the cavemen all the way until today, humanity continues to exist because each generation of people has produced another generation to replace itself.
[01:51:41.348 --> 01:51:46.232]  Scientists have figured out how many people need to be born each generation to replace the generation before.
[01:51:46.792 --> 01:51:48.794]  That number is one person per person.
[01:51:49.255 --> 01:51:52.237]  All things being equal, this creates perfect demographic balance.
[01:51:53.378 --> 01:51:59.424]  Since women are the only ones who can have children, replacing every person on Earth means each woman needs to have two children.
[01:52:00.005 --> 01:52:02.567]  One to replace her, and the other to replace the man.
[01:52:03.048 --> 01:52:04.068]  Who cannot have children?
[01:52:04.549 --> 01:52:08.553]  The total fertility rate is the average number of children each woman in a society is having.
[01:52:08.813 --> 01:52:11.596]  This number shows us if a society is growing or shrinking.
[01:52:12.476 --> 01:52:17.121]  In developed countries, the replacement rate birth rate is 2.1 children per woman.
[01:52:17.521 --> 01:52:25.248]  This will keep the population stable, but even that is assuming that every woman has children, and that there are no wars, famines, or disease.
[01:52:26.209 --> 01:52:32.415]  In the real world, disasters happen all the time, and sadly not all children reach adulthood, especially in poor countries.
[01:52:32.836 --> 01:52:35.078]  This pushes their replacement rate up to 3.3 children per woman.
[01:52:36.759 --> 01:52:46.227]  Since not every woman wants to have children, in order to keep the population stable, some women need to have more than 2.1 children to balance the birth rate with the women who are only having one, or no children at all.
[01:52:47.008 --> 01:52:49.350]  Maintaining this balance is of the utmost importance.
[01:52:49.850 --> 01:52:55.154]  If society does not at least replace itself every generation, human numbers begin to fall exponentially.
[01:52:55.995 --> 01:53:01.580]  Economic and social problems appear, as elderly people retiring begin to outnumber young people entering the workplace.
[01:53:03.132 --> 01:53:05.514]  This is already happening all over the developed world.
[01:53:06.094 --> 01:53:15.900]  Many of the world's nations are only barely replacing themselves, while a growing majority have birth rates below replacement, some as low as 1.8 or even 1.2 babies per woman.
[01:53:17.020 --> 01:53:19.502]  Many societies are facing a very real danger.
[01:53:20.462 --> 01:53:20.863]  Extinction.
[01:53:25.667 --> 01:53:26.607]  Think about it, folks.
[01:53:27.328 --> 01:53:28.828]  Okay, let's go to the next clip.
[01:53:29.688 --> 01:53:32.930]  Food, there's lots of it, because people say, okay, well, there's not enough food.
[01:53:33.370 --> 01:53:36.911]  No, they pay Western farmers worldwide not to produce food.
[01:53:36.991 --> 01:53:37.711]  Let's go to that clip.
[01:53:40.152 --> 01:53:45.954]  According to believers in overpopulation, there are so many of us on the planet that food production cannot possibly keep up.
[01:53:47.775 --> 01:53:48.075]  However,
[01:53:50.452 --> 01:53:56.858]  Thanks to the American Agricultural Organization and the World Food Program, there is currently enough food on the planet for everyone to be well fed.
[01:53:57.839 --> 01:54:01.362]  Not only that, but we're growing this food on less land than we did in the past.
[01:54:01.802 --> 01:54:08.949]  This is why in the United States, for example, the government can afford to pay farmers not to grow food, but instead return their farmlands to the wild.
[01:54:10.170 --> 01:54:15.915]  Modern technology also allows us to grow food on land where it would have been impossible to do so even a few years ago.
[01:54:16.856 --> 01:54:23.842]  Agricultural experts even believe that Africa, if cultivated using modern farming methods, could eventually feed the whole world, all by itself.
[01:54:24.483 --> 01:54:26.605]  Then why are people in many parts of the world starving?
[01:54:27.105 --> 01:54:32.169]  The World Food Program lists key causes of hunger, and overpopulation is not on that list.
[01:54:32.970 --> 01:54:37.656]  War, one of the leading causes of world hunger, destroys crops and disrupts relief efforts.
[01:54:38.436 --> 01:54:41.680]  Widespread poverty prevents many from buying the food that they need.
[01:54:42.501 --> 01:54:47.407]  And a lack of infrastructure means that there isn't a reliable way to transport food to areas that need it.
[01:54:49.099 --> 01:54:53.420]  This is why reducing the number of hungry people will not make the remaining people less hungry.
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:58.682]  Those who have access to the food will continue to have access to it, and those who don't will still be hungry.
[01:54:59.422 --> 01:55:02.723]  Reducing population will not magically cause food to be spread around equally.
[01:55:03.543 --> 01:55:09.344]  And blaming overpopulation for everything does nothing but distract us from the real problems that we actually have.
[01:55:11.125 --> 01:55:11.605]  Think about it.
[01:55:15.370 --> 01:55:17.912]  Perfectly done, absolutely accurate.
[01:55:18.532 --> 01:55:19.853]  That is the facts.
[01:55:20.454 --> 01:55:34.945]  The West is dying, and the British Royal Commission, by eugenicists, by the British government, in 1949, said, if we industrialize Latin America, Africa, and Asia, they will stop having even their replacement rate, like the West.
[01:55:35.425 --> 01:55:37.947]  That trend had already kicked in, in many Western countries.
[01:55:38.468 --> 01:55:40.189]  But they said, if we do
[01:55:43.439 --> 01:55:48.585]  Industrialize them though, that will make them politically powerful and then we can't control them through finance and military.
[01:55:49.065 --> 01:56:02.240]  So they said what we're going to do is, we're going to block economic development and industrial development, then there will be a giant population bloom, but we'll come in with other corrective measures like sterilization, cutting off food and water with war.
[01:56:03.294 --> 01:56:09.196]  And that's in State Department Memorandum 200 from 1973 and in the CIA accompanying memorandum.
[01:56:09.216 --> 01:56:21.040]  And of course it's in the book, Ecoscience, written by the White House science czar, John P. Holdren, with Paul R. Ehrlich, that they were just talking about in that piece.
[01:56:21.060 --> 01:56:26.762]  We're going to come back with the final video that actually talks about Ehrlich and Malthus and where these lies came from.
[01:56:27.282 --> 01:56:29.623]  It came from the British eugenicists.
[01:56:30.203 --> 01:56:32.304]  Now we're going to cover proto-eugenics.
[01:56:33.291 --> 01:56:38.776]  The roots of the roots understand this and what the world government's state of goal is.
[01:56:39.337 --> 01:56:41.319]  For the New World Order, world government's only the beginning.
[01:56:41.899 --> 01:56:45.122]  Forced global extermination of 80 to 99 percent.
[01:56:45.182 --> 01:56:47.184]  They debate if they'll kill us all.
[01:56:47.785 --> 01:56:48.425]  This is public.
[01:56:48.445 --> 01:56:48.966]  We'll be right back.
[01:56:49.606 --> 01:56:50.507]  We're on the march.
[01:56:51.008 --> 01:56:52.609]  The empire's on the run.
[01:56:53.530 --> 01:56:56.213]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:56:59.602 --> 01:57:02.203]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:57:02.623 --> 01:57:07.585]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:57:07.945 --> 01:57:09.665]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:57:09.986 --> 01:57:14.807]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:57:14.987 --> 01:57:15.948]  How much do you want?
[01:57:16.168 --> 01:57:16.908]  When do you want it?
[01:57:17.288 --> 01:57:18.890]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:57:19.170 --> 01:57:20.011]  When will you need it?
[01:57:20.251 --> 01:57:22.314]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:57:22.454 --> 01:57:23.555]  Will there be any food?
[01:57:23.795 --> 01:57:25.136]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:57:25.317 --> 01:57:30.402]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:57:30.602 --> 01:57:33.786]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:57:34.186 --> 01:57:37.650]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:57:37.990 --> 01:57:38.971]  How much will you need?
[01:57:39.211 --> 01:57:39.831]  We don't know.
[01:57:40.111 --> 01:57:41.032]  How much do you want?
[01:57:41.232 --> 01:57:41.952]  All you can get.
[01:57:42.152 --> 01:57:42.993]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:57:43.253 --> 01:57:45.994]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:57:46.295 --> 01:57:48.476]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:57:48.496 --> 01:57:49.496]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:57:59.312 --> 01:58:01.593]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:58:01.613 --> 01:58:03.914]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:58:04.014 --> 01:58:06.836]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:58:07.216 --> 01:58:11.979]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:58:12.339 --> 01:58:16.521]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:58:16.841 --> 01:58:19.163]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:58:19.183 --> 01:58:21.704]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:58:21.724 --> 01:58:24.646]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:58:24.986 --> 01:58:32.591]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:58:32.911 --> 01:58:38.174]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:58:38.314 --> 01:58:41.115]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:58:41.175 --> 01:58:44.597]  So it's gonna be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:58:44.857 --> 01:58:45.757]  And I got news for you.
[01:58:45.917 --> 01:58:47.238]  You're everyone else.
[01:58:47.258 --> 01:58:48.259]  Invisible Empire.

[01:58:58.519 --> 01:58:59.160]  Hi, everyone.
[01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:00.181]  Andy Anderson here.
[01:59:00.381 --> 01:59:04.645]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[01:59:04.806 --> 01:59:10.452]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[01:59:10.592 --> 01:59:14.856]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, good-bye effectiveness?
[01:59:14.936 --> 01:59:16.638]  No more protection till you use it again.
[01:59:16.778 --> 01:59:17.958]  PureWorks to the rescue!
[01:59:18.119 --> 01:59:22.480]  Our FDA-compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.
[01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:24.581]  Their killing power lasts up to four hours.
[01:59:24.721 --> 01:59:37.745]  PureWorks Disinfecting Spray is EPA-certified to kill swine flu, bird flu, MRSA, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and for our friends in medicine, kills C. diff, along with a whole host of viruses and bacteria, moles, and fungus, too.
[01:59:37.785 --> 01:59:39.326]  It's even safe around pets and children.
[01:59:39.426 --> 01:59:42.507]  You'll love how your skin feels with PureWorks Soft and Supple.
[01:59:42.587 --> 01:59:43.628]  No more dry skin.
[01:59:43.768 --> 01:59:48.209]  Here's to a little peace of mind knowing that your hands are still germ-free hours later.
[01:59:48.369 --> 01:59:55.412]  Call now toll-free 888-245-0300 to get your hands on PureWorks and get PureWorks on your hands.
[01:59:55.532 --> 01:59:55.832]  That's 888-245-0300.
[02:00:04.449 --> 02:00:06.372]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:06.852 --> 02:00:09.676]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:11.379 --> 02:00:16.526]  Okay, I want to get into how race is used to control and divide and conquer and we'll talk about
[02:00:17.728 --> 02:00:23.890]  The reality of where this self-induced mental illness is going here in just a moment.
[02:00:24.770 --> 02:00:31.192]  We ran out of time yesterday to play Professor Camus Cambon, which is just par for the course.
[02:00:31.492 --> 02:00:35.673]  But the point is, the academics in the crowd are clapping and smiling and agreeing with him.
[02:00:36.033 --> 02:00:38.594]  Now, we haven't edited the video, but I've got to pause in the middle.
[02:00:38.954 --> 02:00:43.575]  I was going to play it, but he says the N-word a bunch, calling white people the N-word.
[02:00:44.515 --> 02:00:48.419]  And, you know, you can play this on radio, but it upsets people, so I'm just not going to play that part.
[02:00:48.739 --> 02:00:54.304]  If you want to watch the full video, we'll give you the address if you want to go see it unedited from C-SPAN.
[02:00:54.745 --> 02:01:07.237]  Now, this happened a few years ago, but the point is, this is very popular, and this is pushed, and this is promoted, but he's got the same view, but from another perspective, as the globalists that want to reduce everybody's numbers.
[02:01:08.404 --> 02:01:10.185]  I mean, he's saying it's white people doing this.
[02:01:11.065 --> 02:01:13.186]  I'm going to break this down, because it's just a great illustration.
[02:01:13.947 --> 02:01:15.207]  But back to population.
[02:01:15.868 --> 02:01:22.751]  Let's play the clip here of overpopulation, the making of a myth that goes with those other two clips we just played.
[02:01:22.771 --> 02:01:29.714]  And I want everybody to go to Infowars.com, where Kurt Nemo's got all three of the articles posted, along with an article he wrote, and all three of the videos.
[02:01:30.095 --> 02:01:36.738]  So you can send that to your friends and family who are brainwashed and think they should pay carbon taxes for every child they have.
[02:01:37.418 --> 02:01:41.526]  Not only does the government own your house and now it says it owns your body.
[02:01:42.387 --> 02:01:46.374]  As they collectivize all of our wealth into their hands and all of our rights go out the window.
[02:01:47.256 --> 02:01:48.799]  But let's go ahead and go to this final clip.
[02:01:50.791 --> 02:02:02.674]  The myth of overpopulation originated in England in 1798, when a vicar named Thomas Malthus, who fancied himself something of a mathematician, saw that food production increased incrementally, but people reproduced exponentially.
[02:02:03.614 --> 02:02:08.035]  He sat down and did some simple math, and summarily decided that the world would be out of food by 1890.
[02:02:08.195 --> 02:02:15.257]  He blamed reduced mortality rates, and recommended killing off the have-nots of society, lest the haves starve to death.
[02:02:16.303 --> 02:02:24.209]  This cry was taken up by Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University in 1968, who claimed that reckless human reproduction had overwhelmed the Earth.
[02:02:25.050 --> 02:02:30.734]  Massive famines would result, which would destroy, best case scenario, one-fifth of humanity by the end of the 70s.
[02:02:31.135 --> 02:02:32.256]  And the planet would follow.
[02:02:33.096 --> 02:02:42.818]  This fear produced large donations for the newly created UNFPA, which thrives on an imagined crisis that has been both imminent and rescheduled again and again over the past two centuries.
[02:02:43.198 --> 02:02:53.940]  The truth of the matter is that every family on this planet could have a house, with a yard, and all live together on a landmass the size of Texas, which is really just a small corner of the planet.
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:58.520]  The population of Earth will peak in 30 years, start to go back down.
[02:02:59.141 --> 02:03:00.201]  We're not overpopulated.
[02:03:00.821 --> 02:03:01.241]  Do the math.
[02:03:04.454 --> 02:03:19.040]  Now they mentioned Paul Ehrlich in that, who co-wrote the book with John P. Holder and the White House Science Czar, calling for drugging the water supply to sterilize us, but they said you've got to do it incrementally so people don't notice that the fertility is dropping, but now it has.
[02:03:19.500 --> 02:03:20.401]  They are doing it!
[02:03:21.081 --> 02:03:23.122]  The government is taking your baby's blood at birth.
[02:03:23.182 --> 02:03:25.003]  I told you that over a decade ago.
[02:03:25.043 --> 02:03:26.063]  It's now mainstream news.
[02:03:26.604 --> 02:03:31.006]  It is put in the Cold Springs Harbor slash UN eugenics database.
[02:03:31.806 --> 02:03:38.029]  The world government follows a religion of eugenics and extermination and social Darwinism.
[02:03:38.389 --> 02:03:40.490]  You better find out about it.
[02:03:41.050 --> 02:03:46.533]  And we covered it in my film, End Game, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[02:03:47.333 --> 02:03:49.476]  Because it just didn't get picked up by Paul Ehrlich.
[02:03:49.496 --> 02:03:51.359]  They had to be, you know, simple in a minute and a half.
[02:03:51.980 --> 02:03:54.924]  Paul Ehrlich was a crypto-eugenicist.
[02:03:55.444 --> 02:03:56.966]  And so is the White House Science Czar.
[02:03:57.006 --> 02:03:59.570]  And so are all these people running this system.
[02:04:01.332 --> 02:04:02.234]  Shifting gears now.
[02:04:04.278 --> 02:04:11.862]  I'm just going to play most of this ten minute clip, because yesterday I tried to play it and ran out of time, and then I'm just going to comment after.
[02:04:11.882 --> 02:04:15.643]  I'm going to write notes and comment after, because I'm going to start commenting beforehand.
[02:04:15.703 --> 02:04:23.107]  It's just that everything this guy is saying is true, except he's saying white people magically are evil.
[02:04:23.307 --> 02:04:25.408]  No, human beings, people are people.
[02:04:26.906 --> 02:04:29.428]  Black African tribes enslave black African tribes.
[02:04:30.329 --> 02:04:32.210]  Arab tribes have enslaved Arab tribes.
[02:04:32.691 --> 02:04:34.252]  Most of the Roman slaves were white.
[02:04:35.193 --> 02:04:36.654]  White people enslaving white people.
[02:04:37.134 --> 02:04:38.595]  Most of the immigrants to the U.S.
[02:04:38.695 --> 02:04:41.918]  before 1776 were indentured servants.
[02:04:42.478 --> 02:04:46.241]  You know, I had some family came over as pilgrims on the Mayflower.
[02:04:46.722 --> 02:04:49.164]  I had other ancestors that came over as indentured servants.
[02:04:49.504 --> 02:04:50.645]  And you were just a sharecropper.
[02:04:50.665 --> 02:04:51.605]  You never got out of debt.
[02:04:51.626 --> 02:04:52.606]  You were basically a slave.
[02:04:53.567 --> 02:04:55.829]  So the media only tells you about black slavery.
[02:04:57.228 --> 02:04:59.351]  Because that's the way to play people off against each other.
[02:05:00.032 --> 02:05:05.098]  And when they bring in multiculturalism, it's all about differences to make us beat each other's throats instead of just moving on.
[02:05:06.139 --> 02:05:07.200]  Not making it a big issue.
[02:05:07.220 --> 02:05:08.962]  Because tribalism is in all of us.
[02:05:09.723 --> 02:05:12.807]  Via religion, via race, via...
[02:05:14.775 --> 02:05:15.215]  You name it.
[02:05:16.196 --> 02:05:16.616]  It's there.
[02:05:17.477 --> 02:05:20.359]  And now we have tribes of folks that have... I'm not saying they're bad.
[02:05:20.399 --> 02:05:27.004]  I'm just saying different tribes of cowboys and hip-hop people and tattoo tribes and motorcycle tribes.
[02:05:27.424 --> 02:05:28.825]  Those are the tribes of America.
[02:05:29.226 --> 02:05:33.409]  People are really into how they dress and how they talk and what they do.
[02:05:33.689 --> 02:05:34.590]  That's their identity.
[02:05:34.810 --> 02:05:41.655]  Well, my identity is liberty and freedom and science and exploration and protecting the innocent and working together.
[02:05:41.975 --> 02:05:43.897]  But the globalists, through the universities,
[02:05:45.037 --> 02:05:50.218]  It was the Ford Foundation, the federal government, that funded the radical Chicano movement saying the U.S.
[02:05:50.238 --> 02:05:52.399]  belongs to Mexico and that white people are evil.
[02:05:52.519 --> 02:05:52.779]  Why?
[02:05:52.799 --> 02:05:54.459]  They want to have us fighting with each other.
[02:05:54.839 --> 02:05:55.959]  You're not going to get your Oslon.
[02:05:56.199 --> 02:05:56.860]  It's delusional.
[02:05:58.460 --> 02:06:01.441]  It's to destroy the system of freedom that produced all this wealth.
[02:06:01.841 --> 02:06:04.381]  Hadn't been perfect, but what we're going into is tyranny.
[02:06:04.661 --> 02:06:05.841]  So this is social engineering.
[02:06:05.861 --> 02:06:07.922]  So when he talks about, he didn't get into the government
[02:06:08.382 --> 02:06:09.944]  Creating AIDS, that's declassified.
[02:06:10.764 --> 02:06:12.966]  But he gets into how they're using medicine to kill people.
[02:06:13.847 --> 02:06:16.169]  But he says the white man wants to sell you cigarettes.
[02:06:16.830 --> 02:06:23.136]  No, the white man pulled up almost 600 years ago in Cuba and said, man, I like smoking this.
[02:06:23.817 --> 02:06:25.759]  And the natives were going, yeah, we like it too.
[02:06:25.819 --> 02:06:26.759]  It's really addictive.
[02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:28.621]  Cigars, baby.
[02:06:31.616 --> 02:06:39.745]  I mean, the Chinese are selling cigarettes, the Japanese are selling them, African... I mean, there's African tobacco production, blacks selling cigarettes to blacks.
[02:06:42.368 --> 02:06:50.977]  There are evil mafias in the Italian grips, in the WASP grips, in the black grips, in the Jewish grips, but when people say, well, all Italians are mafia...
[02:06:51.991 --> 02:06:52.571]  That's a fraud.
[02:06:52.631 --> 02:06:54.613]  Or when you say all whites are evil, that's a fraud.
[02:06:54.633 --> 02:06:57.895]  Or you say all blacks are criminals, that's a stereotype, a fraud.
[02:06:58.455 --> 02:07:04.940]  When you say all Jews, you know, are running the banks in a New World Order, well there is a Jewish mafia involved in that and we expose it.
[02:07:05.220 --> 02:07:08.022]  But it's not the only group, the only system.
[02:07:08.242 --> 02:07:21.791]  That's why they have fake federal groups out there who've been caught, like Hal Turner and countless others, trying to radicalize the In the Fed movement to make it anti-Semitic so that we're divided again and so we can't ever get the people together.
[02:07:22.931 --> 02:07:25.072]  They want us all fighting with each other.
[02:07:25.692 --> 02:07:28.253]  And so I oppose mafia, I oppose criminality.
[02:07:28.553 --> 02:07:35.535]  But there's mafia in Africa, there's mafia in Iran, there are cliques and good old boy clubs in England, in Israel.
[02:07:35.795 --> 02:07:37.856]  You know, there's boss hog types in small towns.
[02:07:37.876 --> 02:07:43.598]  You'll have one town that's good and free, because they've got good people in it that got involved and believe in freedom.
[02:07:43.838 --> 02:07:46.899]  You'll have a town next door, a county next door, totally thug run.
[02:07:47.259 --> 02:07:50.080]  And those counties always fall apart because everybody moves out of it that can't.
[02:07:50.896 --> 02:07:51.216]  Okay?
[02:07:51.376 --> 02:07:53.277]  That's why the Feds don't want states' rights.
[02:07:53.317 --> 02:07:55.437]  They don't want you to be able to run state to state for freedom.
[02:07:55.657 --> 02:07:56.797]  They don't want you to have a choice.
[02:07:56.998 --> 02:07:59.738]  The global government doesn't want you to be able to run from country to country.
[02:07:59.778 --> 02:08:00.358]  They say this.
[02:08:00.618 --> 02:08:02.679]  They want taxes about 80% worldwide.
[02:08:03.519 --> 02:08:05.120]  They want everybody under their control.
[02:08:05.660 --> 02:08:07.280]  That's what the Euro's about.
[02:08:07.380 --> 02:08:10.421]  You heard Greg Powell's BBC talk to one of the founders of the Euro.
[02:08:10.741 --> 02:08:16.282]  He admitted it's about not letting anybody have lower taxes, and it's about bankrupting nations to take control of them.
[02:08:16.302 --> 02:08:17.843]  It's a global economic order.
[02:08:18.263 --> 02:08:18.903]  It's a system.
[02:08:19.995 --> 02:08:31.400]  And the main reason white people have dominated this globe was language and was the fact that they were the last domino to fall to tyranny.
[02:08:31.420 --> 02:08:35.662]  I said I'm going to go to this clip, but there's just so much history I want to give you.
[02:08:36.602 --> 02:08:37.642]  Rome had fallen.
[02:08:38.963 --> 02:08:41.304]  Other empires had fallen because they become decadent.
[02:08:42.520 --> 02:08:45.063]  But some of the science survives in the Dark Ages.
[02:08:45.804 --> 02:08:53.233]  And you had the wild tribes of Britannia, Albion, Gaul, Germania, and other areas.
[02:08:53.773 --> 02:08:56.176]  And you had the trade system that had been set up by the Vikings.
[02:08:56.837 --> 02:08:58.859]  And all of that merged together.
[02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:18.355]  In the last thousand years, and then it came out of the Dark Ages in the last six hundred, five hundred, you had the Renaissance, the Great Awakening, liberty, freedom, literature, Gutenberg's printing press, the greatest invention, it's read as the greatest invention by man, that produced incredible wealth.
[02:09:18.415 --> 02:09:22.278]  It wasn't perfect, but the move towards liberty was the greatest humans had ever seen.
[02:09:23.559 --> 02:09:23.899]  Okay?
[02:09:24.660 --> 02:09:28.483]  That produced all this wealth, and
[02:09:29.295 --> 02:09:34.497]  Then, the tyranny moved back in to take over that wealth and it was able to set up an empire.
[02:09:34.857 --> 02:09:36.457]  So, that's why this happened.
[02:09:37.037 --> 02:09:38.218]  Now, there have been other cultures.
[02:09:38.378 --> 02:09:39.578]  Africa had had Egypt.
[02:09:40.138 --> 02:09:42.599]  It became decadent over 3,000 years and fell.
[02:09:43.540 --> 02:09:43.880]  Okay?
[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:54.083]  I mean, if Egypt had had its rise in the last 600, 700 years, you would have a global African dominant system.
[02:09:55.905 --> 02:09:57.426]  And that's an oversimplification.
[02:09:57.466 --> 02:10:02.050]  The point is, is that that's why you see white people in so many positions.
[02:10:02.270 --> 02:10:05.913]  But those same white people are putting poisons in the vaccines for white people.
[02:10:06.093 --> 02:10:09.716]  They're putting fluoride in the water that gives you cancer and reduces fertility for everybody.
[02:10:10.296 --> 02:10:11.297]  So it's asinine.
[02:10:11.517 --> 02:10:17.281]  The average white person is a guilty person who thinks white people are evil and worships black people.
[02:10:17.522 --> 02:10:18.122]  Okay?
[02:10:18.382 --> 02:10:19.063]  I mean, I'm white.
[02:10:19.203 --> 02:10:19.543]  I know.
[02:10:19.563 --> 02:10:20.384]  I'm around it.
[02:10:20.624 --> 02:10:21.224]  I'm sick of it.
[02:10:21.365 --> 02:10:21.605]  Okay?
[02:10:22.125 --> 02:10:23.066]  I like black people.
[02:10:23.106 --> 02:10:25.168]  I like everybody else, but I haven't done anything wrong.
[02:10:25.468 --> 02:10:26.349]  I don't have any guilt.
[02:10:26.689 --> 02:10:27.670]  I'm not a white devil.
[02:10:27.871 --> 02:10:29.072]  I don't have a tail under here.
[02:10:29.352 --> 02:10:30.233]  I don't have horns.
[02:10:30.473 --> 02:10:31.074]  I'm not bad.
[02:10:32.335 --> 02:10:32.655]  Okay?
[02:10:34.036 --> 02:10:35.598]  Now, there are groups of elitists.
[02:10:35.618 --> 02:10:38.761]  It doesn't matter if they're Japanese, Jewish, German.
[02:10:38.801 --> 02:10:39.942]  They all have these meetings.
[02:10:39.982 --> 02:10:41.263]  They all agree on eugenics.
[02:10:41.684 --> 02:10:45.727]  My dad, you know, had a professor at UT who was the head of the botany department who was Jewish.
[02:10:46.638 --> 02:10:50.201]  Who was openly a eugenicist and said, well, Hitler, you know, went too far.
[02:10:50.542 --> 02:10:51.843]  We don't need to target one group.
[02:10:51.903 --> 02:10:53.204]  We need to target dumb people.
[02:10:53.524 --> 02:10:56.727]  I mean, this transcends, okay?
[02:10:57.007 --> 02:11:03.813]  And as long as we say it's the white people or it's the black people or it's the Jews, one group, we're just going to be divided and fight with each other.
[02:11:03.833 --> 02:11:04.934]  It should be about ideas.
[02:11:05.655 --> 02:11:09.618]  But listen to this guy, because his crescendo is, kill the white people.
[02:11:09.658 --> 02:11:13.040]  We'll play part of it, come back from break, and play the rest, ending the show with it.
[02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:22.206]  Here is this professor on C-SPAN, and the point is, this is an idea held by 5, 6, 7 percent or so of blacks in America.
[02:11:22.246 --> 02:11:29.451]  It's very popular, it's a minority, but it's popular, and it was funded by the government, and this is asinine baloney.
[02:11:29.711 --> 02:11:34.554]  He says all this stuff that's true, but then says the white man is the source of all evil.
[02:11:34.875 --> 02:11:35.415]  Baloney.
[02:11:36.015 --> 02:11:37.276]  Okay, okay.
[02:11:37.296 --> 02:11:42.820]  If you want to say the white man's the source of something, it's the Gutenberg Press.
[02:11:43.020 --> 02:11:43.400]  Here it is.
[02:11:47.143 --> 02:11:52.587]  I want to say a couple of things, and I really don't want you all to miss me before we get ready to go.
[02:11:52.607 --> 02:11:58.351]  My wife was here, and she was the president of the Association of Black Psychologists.
[02:11:59.392 --> 02:12:09.220]  A couple of years ago and she was responsible for taking about 500 people including about 300 black psychologists to Ghana, West Africa for their national conference.
[02:12:09.240 --> 02:12:18.346]  The reason I point that out is because I want to say a couple of things and I'm going to go out of bounds with what I have to say relative to what we've been talking about.
[02:12:20.028 --> 02:12:24.011]  First of all, I grew up in Brooklyn and I saw
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:29.403]  Looking back on my life, I saw about 30 of my friends die.
[02:12:30.003 --> 02:12:34.587]  You know, getting shot, overdosing on drugs.
[02:12:36.129 --> 02:12:38.130]  Any number of things that took them off the planet.
[02:12:38.371 --> 02:12:39.571]  You know, beautiful brothers.
[02:12:40.552 --> 02:12:45.615]  So as I started to become more conscious, I looked around and I started asking this very important question.
[02:12:45.655 --> 02:12:50.479]  I think the most important question that I ask myself and that you can ask yourself is why?
[02:12:51.299 --> 02:12:53.380]  And I wanted to find out what was going on.
[02:12:54.241 --> 02:12:55.782]  So I began to change.
[02:12:55.902 --> 02:12:57.583]  I began to examine everything.
[02:12:57.603 --> 02:13:01.466]  I don't like to use the word critically, but I started to really check things out.
[02:13:03.154 --> 02:13:05.556]  So I went through a very, very serious change.
[02:13:06.457 --> 02:13:07.978]  I mean, serious change.
[02:13:08.839 --> 02:13:13.804]  And what my wife and I did, we decided that we were going to drop out from the system.
[02:13:13.824 --> 02:13:18.168]  We delivered two of our three children at home using midwife.
[02:13:18.268 --> 02:13:19.989]  She didn't take any medication.
[02:13:20.590 --> 02:13:21.771]  We didn't go to a doctor.
[02:13:23.032 --> 02:13:28.878]  She talked me into doing that, but it was a beautiful experience for me to be there to help deliver our children.
[02:13:29.998 --> 02:13:35.705]  They were born, by the way, two years apart on the same day, and our oldest daughter helped us deliver our children.
[02:13:36.286 --> 02:13:38.349]  We also changed our diets.
[02:13:38.950 --> 02:13:43.215]  We saw the hospital system was killing our people, so we changed our diets.
[02:13:44.136 --> 02:13:46.459]  We have been vegan for about 30 years.
[02:13:46.519 --> 02:13:47.440]  That means no meat,
[02:13:49.336 --> 02:13:51.138]  The hospital system's killing everybody, buddy!
[02:13:51.298 --> 02:13:57.282]  ...all in any form, no dairy products, no sugar, no white flour, the same thing that Dr. Woodard could talk about.
[02:13:57.963 --> 02:14:00.204]  Because we understood that we were in a war.
[02:14:00.665 --> 02:14:02.426]  And I want to emphasize that to you.
[02:14:02.826 --> 02:14:04.087]  We are in a war.
[02:14:06.649 --> 02:14:17.377]  We left New York and went to North Carolina and we, and really it's on her again, we decided that we were not going to go in debt because the new form of slavery was economic slavery.
[02:14:19.065 --> 02:14:23.009]  We got some land, we're very fortunate, and we built our own house.
[02:14:23.049 --> 02:14:24.170]  We built a large house.
[02:14:24.190 --> 02:14:25.852]  It took us 16 months.
[02:14:25.892 --> 02:14:29.375]  We worked night and day, every day, for the 16 months.
[02:14:29.415 --> 02:14:38.124]  And she was out there with a chainsaw in the cold, in the rain, and we worked and we built the house so we would not have to give white people any money.
[02:14:39.648 --> 02:14:47.292]  I taught on the college level for a number of years at a so-called black college, and I'm down against black colleges.
[02:14:47.312 --> 02:14:51.935]  I'm going to tell you straight up, because some of the madness that's going on in these schools.
[02:14:52.855 --> 02:14:56.998]  But what I want to say is that there are two things going on on the planet now.
[02:14:57.558 --> 02:15:05.903]  One is that when white people came to us and said, we're going to free you, we're going to emancipate you from the plantation, what they did was
[02:15:08.027 --> 02:15:13.251]  Extended the boundaries of the plantation and made it an international plantation.
[02:15:13.311 --> 02:15:13.852]  That's true.
[02:15:14.752 --> 02:15:16.313]  Made us think that we were free.
[02:15:16.413 --> 02:15:16.914]  That's true.
[02:15:17.454 --> 02:15:23.579]  In addition to that, they made every white person on earth a plantation master.
[02:15:23.659 --> 02:15:24.820]  Not true.
[02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:25.861]  They made us slaves.
[02:15:26.701 --> 02:15:28.122]  So there are two things in operation.
[02:15:28.162 --> 02:15:30.044]  We are in an international prison.
[02:15:31.825 --> 02:15:35.248]  Not just in America, but everywhere we go our people are dying.
[02:15:36.420 --> 02:15:41.164]  So the things that are in operation on this planet is that white people want to kill us.
[02:15:41.444 --> 02:15:42.765]  I want you to understand that.
[02:15:43.266 --> 02:15:44.927]  They want to kill you.
[02:15:44.947 --> 02:15:57.297]  And it has nothing to do with what kind of degree you have, what kind of car you have, what kind of title you have, what fraternity you belong to, what religion you belong to.
[02:15:57.398 --> 02:16:01.161]  They want to kill you because that is part of their plan.
[02:16:02.148 --> 02:16:04.631]  There are any number of reasons why they want to do that.
[02:16:05.051 --> 02:16:08.615]  I'm not going to waste my time trying to figure out why they want to kill us.
[02:16:09.897 --> 02:16:11.559]  But I know that's what they want to do.
[02:16:11.739 --> 02:16:14.082]  And they want to do it in many different ways.
[02:16:15.370 --> 02:16:26.915]  Psychological, economic, cultural, spiritual, social, biological, chemical, electromagnetic, they want to kill you.
[02:16:27.616 --> 02:16:32.518]  But, they also want to make money in the process of your death.
[02:16:32.658 --> 02:16:33.038]  That's true.
[02:16:33.058 --> 02:16:36.139]  Now I saw a brother when I was coming and he was smoking a cigarette.
[02:16:36.500 --> 02:16:41.522]  So now he's gonna kill himself, but they're gonna make money off of his death process.
[02:16:43.612 --> 02:16:49.710]  The other thing is that they want us to, if they don't kill us like they tried to kill the brother by beating him up and...
[02:16:50.794 --> 02:17:07.688]  New Orleans, if they don't kill us that way, or shooting like they killed the brother in Cincinnati, or like they killed Malice Green in Detroit, or like they killed Greenwich up in Pittsburgh, if they don't come out right and kill us straight, they want to get us to kill ourselves.
[02:17:08.549 --> 02:17:11.271]  Now these are the only two operations on the planet.
[02:17:11.451 --> 02:17:13.313]  And then he starts calling white people the N-word.
[02:17:13.333 --> 02:17:19.218]  We're going to cut out that part, come back from break, and play the balance where he calls for killing every white person on earth.
[02:17:20.202 --> 02:17:22.863]  Now, the issue is white people are smoking cigarettes.
[02:17:23.063 --> 02:17:30.707]  I'll guarantee you 99.9% of white people who haven't heard this show don't understand that you've got the top globalists.
[02:17:30.727 --> 02:17:31.348]  But let me tell you something.
[02:17:31.368 --> 02:17:32.148]  China's involved.
[02:17:32.668 --> 02:17:33.609]  Japan's involved.
[02:17:34.769 --> 02:17:36.530]  Black leaders have been bought off in Africa.
[02:17:36.570 --> 02:17:37.090]  They're involved.
[02:17:37.591 --> 02:17:38.931]  He talks about police brutality.
[02:17:39.412 --> 02:17:41.813]  In Africa, the cops act just like they do here or worse.
[02:17:42.393 --> 02:17:43.394]  They're black on black.
[02:17:43.434 --> 02:17:46.355]  It's the nature of corruption and big government, buddy.
[02:17:46.835 --> 02:17:47.936]  Not the white devil.
[02:17:48.797 --> 02:17:49.600]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:50.283 --> 02:17:54.660]  I'm yours truly, the White Devil, Alex Jones, exposing the New World Order.
[02:18:00.390 --> 02:18:01.290]  Global meltdowns.
[02:18:01.650 --> 02:18:02.671]  Massive unemployment.
[02:18:03.051 --> 02:18:03.831]  Endless wars.
[02:18:04.271 --> 02:18:05.512]  A new currency crisis.
[02:18:05.912 --> 02:18:07.653]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[02:18:07.993 --> 02:18:09.833]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[02:18:10.154 --> 02:18:11.774]  So what's the best way to get ready?
[02:18:12.034 --> 02:18:13.755]  To get prepared for hard times ahead.
[02:18:14.115 --> 02:18:15.716]  Introducing Off The Grid News.

[02:19:03.961 --> 02:19:04.861]  Tyranny is here.
[02:19:05.221 --> 02:19:08.883]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:19:09.103 --> 02:19:11.363]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:19:11.383 --> 02:19:16.765]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:19:17.236 --> 02:19:23.521]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:19:23.921 --> 02:19:29.465]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:19:29.886 --> 02:19:33.588]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:19:34.069 --> 02:19:38.132]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:19:38.372 --> 02:19:41.154]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies,
[02:19:41.654 --> 02:19:42.535]  Don't answer it!

[02:20:52.009 --> 02:20:52.330]  That's 800-477-9256.
[02:21:01.758 --> 02:21:04.280]  Alright, here's the climax of the professor.
[02:21:04.761 --> 02:21:08.524]  You know, why doesn't he go out and give speeches against 50 plus percent of black support in their babies?
[02:21:08.544 --> 02:21:09.244]  Oh, he's a liberal.
[02:21:10.285 --> 02:21:15.610]  Why doesn't he go out and tell black folks to rally and expose the government shipping their drugs in?
[02:21:16.807 --> 02:21:18.528]  Or how black leaders are on the payroll.
[02:21:18.568 --> 02:21:19.389]  He probably does.
[02:21:19.749 --> 02:21:22.651]  And I want to reach out to that fella and tell him I want him to come on the show.
[02:21:23.031 --> 02:21:28.594]  But I guess he thinks I have like some evil intelligence and I'm like jacked into the devil and you know I'm different from him.
[02:21:28.614 --> 02:21:30.115]  I mean it's just ridiculous.
[02:21:30.855 --> 02:21:31.756]  It's ridiculous.
[02:21:32.316 --> 02:21:44.641]  I want everybody to live in peace and be happy and go to the stars together, not kill each other, but the globalists are using tribalism to play us off against each other, and black liberation that Obama's involved in is funded by the government.
[02:21:45.001 --> 02:21:47.322]  Because it's not liberation, it's slavery.
[02:21:48.543 --> 02:21:51.884]  Let's go ahead and go back to him saying, we must kill all the white people.
[02:21:51.924 --> 02:21:52.284]  Here it is.
[02:21:56.146 --> 02:22:00.308]  Now, what we have to do is we have to
[02:22:02.253 --> 02:22:05.676]  Divide a system or a plan for ourselves.
[02:22:05.736 --> 02:22:08.538]  And I said earlier that each one of you is a system.
[02:22:09.218 --> 02:22:23.570]  And everything that you do, every thought that you think, either you are supporting white world terror domination by your actions, what you buy, what you wear, where you go, what you eat, how you use your time.
[02:22:24.090 --> 02:22:30.415]  You are either supporting the white people in their process of death or you're for African liberation.
[02:22:30.515 --> 02:22:31.336]  It's one or the other.
[02:22:32.591 --> 02:22:41.354]  And if we don't use our time wisely, then we're engaging in a form of subtle suicide.
[02:22:41.614 --> 02:22:44.436]  Because as I said earlier, their system is still going on.
[02:22:44.756 --> 02:22:47.117]  They still have these images on TV that are going on.
[02:22:47.397 --> 02:22:49.798]  They're still warehousing our children in the special ed.
[02:22:49.918 --> 02:22:50.218]  True.
[02:22:50.258 --> 02:22:51.078]  Giving them Ritalin.
[02:22:51.118 --> 02:22:51.418]  True.
[02:22:52.339 --> 02:22:54.239]  White kids too, buddy.
[02:22:54.499 --> 02:22:56.120]  So their system is not stopping.
[02:22:57.641 --> 02:23:01.122]  And then finally, I want to say that we need one idea.
[02:23:02.970 --> 02:23:06.033]  And we're not thinking about a solution to the problem.
[02:23:06.653 --> 02:23:12.119]  We're dealing with all these other things, but these are diversions from the solution to the problem.
[02:23:13.041 --> 02:23:27.069]  And we have to start to think about a solution to the problem so that these young brothers and sisters who are here now, who are 15, 16, and 17, are not here 25 years later talking about these same problems.
[02:23:27.990 --> 02:23:33.253]  Now how do I know that the white people know that we are going to come up with a solution to the problem?
[02:23:34.548 --> 02:23:48.508]  I know it because they have retina scans, they have what they call racial profiling, DNA banks, and they're monitoring our people to try to prevent the one person from coming up with the one idea.
[02:23:49.881 --> 02:23:55.943]  And the one idea is how we are going to exterminate white people.
[02:23:56.083 --> 02:24:00.245]  Because that, in my estimation, is the only conclusion I have come to.
[02:24:00.565 --> 02:24:05.707]  We have to exterminate white people off of the face of the planet to solve this problem.
[02:24:06.928 --> 02:24:15.351]  Now I don't care whether you clap or not, but I'm saying to you that we need to solve this problem because they are going to kill us.
[02:24:16.830 --> 02:24:18.231]  And I will leave on that.
[02:24:18.391 --> 02:24:27.918]  So we have to just set up our own system and stop playing and get very serious and not be diverted from coming up with a solution to the problem.
[02:24:28.298 --> 02:24:31.000]  And the problem on the planet is white people.
[02:24:32.563 --> 02:24:33.543]  Well, there you go!
[02:24:33.683 --> 02:24:34.324]  Yay!
[02:24:34.344 --> 02:24:38.705]  People are crying and agreeing and clapping and talking about how beautiful it is.
[02:24:39.785 --> 02:24:40.506]  That is sick.
[02:24:41.226 --> 02:24:53.090]  And the globalists fund that, and they fund the white supremacists, and they fund all the rest of it to get us killing each other instead of getting a real economic system together and kicking the parasite banking system off the planet.
[02:24:54.329 --> 02:24:59.073]  But no, that's not going to happen if that professor and many others have his way.
[02:24:59.493 --> 02:25:01.655]  And I've got countless videos, we've posted them.
[02:25:02.276 --> 02:25:07.901]  Glenn Spencer's got them of the illegal alien rallies where they have similar signs and say the same thing.
[02:25:08.822 --> 02:25:13.285]  And then as a white person I go, listen, I don't want to be your enemy, but you're all talking about how you want to kill me.
[02:25:14.927 --> 02:25:16.188]  And see, that's the globalist model.
[02:25:16.228 --> 02:25:16.848]  They say, well,
[02:25:18.157 --> 02:25:25.803]  Not just minority groups that are the majority worldwide, but anybody that we don't get rid of is going to challenge us.
[02:25:25.864 --> 02:25:28.125]  Let's wipe everybody out and go to the stars.
[02:25:28.446 --> 02:25:31.688]  That's what the globalist controllers are saying, but they plan to kill me too.
[02:25:32.029 --> 02:25:34.811]  They plan to kill you, regardless of what color you are.
[02:25:35.071 --> 02:25:36.172]  We'll talk more about it tomorrow.
[02:25:36.192 --> 02:25:38.054]  Great job crew at fullworks.com.
