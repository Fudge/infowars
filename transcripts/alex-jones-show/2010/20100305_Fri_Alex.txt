[00:00:02.523 --> 00:00:14.423]  Chen Zhe Li is the president of the All-China Women's Federation, one of the top-ranking women in the Chinese government, and witness to the major changes in women's status since the Communist Revolution.
[00:00:16.423 --> 00:00:25.046]  Among the first laws passed by Chairman Mao's government were statutes banning foot binding, bride selling, dowry, polygamy, and concubines.
[00:00:25.586 --> 00:00:29.327]  Women were invited to leave the home and join the labor force.
[00:00:29.887 --> 00:00:34.428]  Mao spoke those famous words, women hold up half the sky.
[00:00:35.529 --> 00:00:39.990]  If the statistics are any indication, communism has been good for women.
[00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:54.203]  Constantly, at colleges and at government buildings in Canada, England, the U.S., they're putting up Mao statues.
[00:00:54.343 --> 00:00:55.264]  That's been in the news.
[00:00:55.685 --> 00:00:59.349]  At city halls, they're saying how great he is.
[00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.654]  I've seen three different Obama czars say Mao is good.
[00:01:04.415 --> 00:01:07.797]  Hugo Chavez is good, because he's censoring the media.
[00:01:08.238 --> 00:01:09.879]  And that we need to censor our media.
[00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:12.640]  China has forced abortion with women.
[00:01:13.361 --> 00:01:16.423]  Women are used as slaves in the factories.
[00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:20.626]  And it was declassified, of course, that the CIA financed the women's movement.
[00:01:21.246 --> 00:01:21.366]  Yeah.
[00:01:36.394 --> 00:01:36.814]  Is that right?
[00:01:59.318 --> 00:02:19.494]  Colossus to destroy all competition because no one can compete with a billion five hundred million slaves and that's what they're just about a billion five hundred million India over a billion it is just incredible what's going on and to have the media praising a mass murderer is unprecedented now
[00:02:20.655 --> 00:02:25.139]  Wayne Paul is a CPA, brother of Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:33.785]  He is an in-the-Fed activist, a patriot of many decades, exposing the IRS, that is a collection agency for the Federal Reserve.
[00:02:34.606 --> 00:02:38.229]  And he joins us for the next 50 minutes here today.
[00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.853]  We'll also open the phones up and cover other news and get Wayne Paul's take on what's going on.
[00:02:42.893 --> 00:02:49.638]  But Wayne, did you ever think you'd see CNN praising the greatest mass murderer in world history?
[00:02:50.347 --> 00:02:52.968]  Never in my lifetime would I have thought that.
[00:02:55.309 --> 00:03:03.311]  Wayne, so much has happened in your decades of fighting the New World Order.
[00:03:04.772 --> 00:03:09.813]  Break down for people your worldview, your family's worldview.
[00:03:12.335 --> 00:03:19.377]  Yeah, and I think we all have to sit back and take a look at what's going on, recognizing the fact that 10 years ago,
[00:03:38.978 --> 00:03:48.405]  Alex Jones had such an idea on a radio station, he probably couldn't get enough sponsors to have him on.
[00:03:48.445 --> 00:04:01.875]  Yet today it makes sense with the understanding of our economic condition and the control of the major banking cartels throughout the world that controls everything we do.
[00:04:04.722 --> 00:04:30.511]  Interesting to me that today, educationally, we as a people are much wiser today about the concept of a new world order and what they're doing to our individual liberties and freedoms, that I think it's a fantastic time to be living just to see the changes and the understanding that the people have that they didn't have ten years ago.
[00:04:31.795 --> 00:04:34.176]  Wayne Paul, you're in the Obama deception.
[00:04:34.236 --> 00:04:41.918]  I interviewed you up at an In the Fed rally that later came out the Army was watching because we're such evil Americans that want to get these foreign banks off our backs.
[00:04:43.278 --> 00:04:53.981]  And you talked about how the bankers took over the War Powers Act, what Social Security really is, how the bankers are able to violate the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[00:04:54.401 --> 00:04:56.522]  Break it down in more detail
[00:04:57.022 --> 00:04:58.243]  Well, it really goes back further than 1933.
[00:04:58.283 --> 00:05:01.284]  It goes back to 1913, when the Federal Reserve Act was first passed.
[00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:03.565]  When that happened, the Congress, in effect, gave up
[00:05:24.065 --> 00:05:33.049]  Our liberties as it relates to our rights to banking and our rights to exchange property for services.
[00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:42.834]  And it took only 20 years from 1913 to 1933 before our federal government was bankrupt.
[00:05:43.394 --> 00:05:52.658]  They spent more money and borrowed more money from the Federal Reserve in the first 20 years of the Reserve's existence.
[00:05:53.604 --> 00:05:59.586]  That in 1933, Roosevelt declared the United States was bankrupt.
[00:06:00.506 --> 00:06:13.670]  So since that time, it's the Federal Reserve banking cartel that has manipulated or controlled whatever they saw fit for our economy and our life.
[00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.850]  And it's taken from 1933 to present.
[00:06:19.676 --> 00:06:28.119]  For those of us who have been studying and researching this come to understand and are able to teach it to other people.
[00:06:28.799 --> 00:06:31.761]  So we now have to start that change.
[00:06:32.461 --> 00:06:48.947]  Now one of the changes that's going on dramatically right now are the various states that are passing state laws as it relates to banking, as it relates to gun control, as it relates to carrying
[00:06:50.792 --> 00:06:59.598]  And they're saying to the federal government, constitutionally, you can't come into this state and tell us whether we can have a gun or not.
[00:07:00.278 --> 00:07:09.104]  And you can't come into this state and tell us that if we bank within the state, we don't have to be under the federal regulations.
[00:07:09.484 --> 00:07:15.468]  All these things are exciting in terms of the changes that are taking place today.
[00:07:17.588 --> 00:07:19.850]  Well, expanding on that, you're absolutely right.
[00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:25.915]  But 1933 was when they were able to bankrupt us and bring us into emergency rule.
[00:07:25.935 --> 00:07:28.578]  1913 was when they got their beachhead.
[00:07:29.098 --> 00:07:33.542]  And then just a few years later, they were able to bring us into receivership.
[00:07:33.642 --> 00:07:40.568]  Then they issued the Social Security card that was literally the debt servant system.
[00:07:40.628 --> 00:07:43.431]  And that's when they began making us their dependents.
[00:07:43.971 --> 00:07:50.269]  And expanding it and so we've been under their system since 33 completely under their thumb since 33.
[00:07:51.929 --> 00:07:58.855]  And all we've seen since then is a progression of social engineering, booms and busts, as the banks mass more and more power.
[00:07:59.175 --> 00:08:02.778]  And now they brag that they've gotten more power out of the banker bailout.
[00:08:03.398 --> 00:08:06.961]  They're establishing a bank of the world, a global constitution.
[00:08:07.001 --> 00:08:09.663]  We'll pay our carbon taxes to the bankers.
[00:08:10.004 --> 00:08:17.350]  They admit this is meant to shut down competition, vertically consolidate and integrate the economy into a worldwide monopoly.
[00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:26.072]  Controlled by this by this cartel and you're right the states are waking up the people are waking up We've never seen such an awakening.
[00:08:26.113 --> 00:08:46.739]  It's past the house your brother's bill Congressman Ron Paul who joined us yesterday to audit The private fellow reserve, but I believe they're gonna strike back and I believe they're gonna do that Wayne through staging crises and staging wars and staging terror attacks to be blamed on The tea parties and the in the Fed groups.
[00:08:47.079 --> 00:08:47.699]  What's your take on?
[00:08:48.479 --> 00:09:16.330]  Well, it's kind of interesting that you bring that up, because if you look at our gubernatorial race here in Texas alone, and when the minority, uh, gaunche Texan was running against the two incumbents, uh, she was put on a show and the first thing the guy said is, are you a believer
[00:09:17.299 --> 00:09:21.541]  Are you a truther as relates to 9-11?
[00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:29.103]  Unfortunately, that didn't have anything to do with the race in Texas, but it was used to make her look bad.
[00:09:30.224 --> 00:09:45.469]  But the truth be known that whether it's 9-11, whether it's the killing that took place in Waco, Ruby Ridge,
[00:09:46.321 --> 00:09:55.306]  All of these are suspect as a basis to eliminate a little more of our freedom.
[00:09:56.606 --> 00:10:04.531]  You know, now you almost have to go through a complete body cavity search to get on an airplane.
[00:10:05.691 --> 00:10:15.096]  And that's pretty demeaning, in my opinion, and it's pretty taking away a lot of my privacy.
[00:10:16.258 --> 00:10:31.967]  And as a person handicapped that has a hard time standing, going through a security line and having to stand there and not being able to touch anything is really
[00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.550]  Uh, demeaning to me.
[00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:38.391]  Did you see the report of the boy that couldn't even walk?
[00:10:38.691 --> 00:10:39.411]  He was four.
[00:10:39.711 --> 00:10:40.732]  He was in leg braces.
[00:10:40.772 --> 00:10:42.552]  He couldn't walk more than just a few feet.
[00:10:42.972 --> 00:10:46.233]  They had just gotten him in that last month, able to walk a few feet in a wheelchair.
[00:10:46.553 --> 00:10:53.974]  They made him get out of the wheelchair without his parents' help and go through the metal detector while he was crying.
[00:10:54.775 --> 00:10:56.375]  It's all an act of submission.
[00:10:56.755 --> 00:11:00.096]  Recording our naked body because somebody might do something.
[00:11:00.136 --> 00:11:01.296]  We're all guilty now.
[00:11:03.082 --> 00:11:03.803]  That's correct.
[00:11:03.983 --> 00:11:21.941]  And I think we're going to see more and more of that kind of thing as, quote, a deterrent to terrorism, and it's only going to take more and more of the freedom from us.
[00:11:22.622 --> 00:11:23.503]  And they're doing that
[00:11:27.248 --> 00:11:45.298]  Yeah, let's talk about that, because they're raising taxes on every level, police have been caught with quotas that are illegal all over the country, and they're just building up this police state to forcibly extract this from us.
[00:11:45.338 --> 00:11:50.501]  And I agree with you, regardless of whether terror in each case is real or staged or not,
[00:11:51.696 --> 00:11:58.730]  It's being focused on the average free person as a pretext to take our rights, as the Homeland Security document showed last year.
[00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:59.932]  Wayne Paul, stay with us.
[00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:05.271]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:14:00.521 --> 00:14:02.702]  Hi, this is Peter Krashnobyl with Midas Resources.
[00:14:02.862 --> 00:14:07.544]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high, and inflation will be a direct result of the spending policy.
[00:14:07.644 --> 00:14:14.107]  The multiple federal stimulus packages have been an utter failure, unless you're an executive for AIG, a large banking or investment institution.
[00:14:14.248 --> 00:14:16.689]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[00:14:16.749 --> 00:14:19.250]  People like you and I can't go to Washington for a bailout.
[00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:24.312]  Having your hard-earned money in the stock market or any other related paper asset is a lose-lose proposition.
[00:14:24.492 --> 00:14:25.833]  Lose on your capital investment,
[00:14:26.013 --> 00:14:29.217]  And when you cash out, you're paid in the dollar that is losing value every day.
[00:14:29.377 --> 00:14:35.585]  One thing is certain, having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens, your investment will never be worthless.
[00:14:35.745 --> 00:14:39.590]  If you've been thinking about investing in physical possession of precious metals, I can help.

[00:15:03.715 --> 00:15:14.823]  Crowded public places, global pandemics, and news reports of potential new strains of bacteria and viruses make you wonder, what if there was a germ killing nasal spray that acted almost like hand sanitizer for your nose?
[00:15:15.163 --> 00:15:15.763]  There is!

[00:16:19.717 --> 00:16:21.797]  Well, our predictions worn out.
[00:16:21.817 --> 00:16:29.859]  Glenn Beck's gone wild saying a 9-11 truther shot the people at the Pentagon with no evidence of it other than some message board stuff.
[00:16:31.259 --> 00:16:32.379]  Here they are from last night.
[00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:35.180]  September 11th, conspiracy theorist opens fire at Pentagon.
[00:16:37.267 --> 00:16:40.089]  Why are they so scared of people that talk about staged events?
[00:16:40.129 --> 00:16:43.051]  We're getting into that in the next hour after Wayne Paul leaves us.
[00:16:43.151 --> 00:16:44.732]  Wayne is a CPA.
[00:16:44.852 --> 00:16:49.334]  He's been battling the IRS, exposing their activities for years.
[00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:56.519]  Whether you think the income tax is constitutional or not, what we know isn't constitutional is their treatment of people.
[00:16:56.599 --> 00:17:03.183]  No due process, their own special courts, seizing things just because they feel like it, just like the family court.
[00:17:04.082 --> 00:17:07.383]  We know they violate the Constitution and Bill of Rights every day.
[00:17:07.463 --> 00:17:11.003]  We know they drive people into suicide, into desperation.
[00:17:11.544 --> 00:17:14.864]  Most people that own businesses can't pay all these taxes or they'd go under.
[00:17:15.644 --> 00:17:18.945]  Wayne Paul, you've been battling these guys for years.
[00:17:19.225 --> 00:17:22.246]  You were talking about financial tyranny as we went to break.
[00:17:22.306 --> 00:17:23.086]  Talk about that now.
[00:17:23.626 --> 00:17:32.448]  Well, one of the quick things I would like to point out is that last year the government in their infinite wisdom
[00:17:33.464 --> 00:17:42.310]  Decreased the withholding tax tables that employers had to withhold money from the employees to send to the government.
[00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:45.412]  And they said, here, we're going to give you a break.
[00:17:46.533 --> 00:17:54.698]  The problem with that is they never changed the tax rate for the year as it relates to the tax return.
[00:17:55.479 --> 00:17:59.061]  So now we're filing tax returns for the year 2009, and guess what?
[00:18:02.779 --> 00:18:12.249]  Many, many more people owe taxes this year, wherein prior years they either broke even or got a few dollars back.
[00:18:13.109 --> 00:18:22.339]  So they deceived the people during the years saying they were going to give them a benefit, but oops, they forgot to change the tax rate tables.
[00:18:22.419 --> 00:18:23.139]  And guess what?
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.462]  We have to pay for it now.
[00:18:26.565 --> 00:18:32.991]  So is it true that they're going to charge penalties and interest if people don't have the money?
[00:18:33.832 --> 00:18:34.873]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:18:35.013 --> 00:18:38.096]  After April 15th, penalty and interest accrues.
[00:18:41.599 --> 00:18:45.783]  And most people who work at McDonald's or at an auto repair shop or...
[00:18:46.846 --> 00:18:55.229]  And that's absolutely the case and that's probably the most frustrating part of my work is trying to negate or eliminate penalties and interest on taxes
[00:19:14.338 --> 00:19:19.721]  Because of errors the IRS made as well as errors that the taxpayer makes.
[00:19:20.262 --> 00:19:26.005]  They're not very willing to ever amend or adjust penalties and interest.
[00:19:30.508 --> 00:19:32.629]  And the IRS makes a lot of mistakes, don't they?
[00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:41.455]  Well, there was a GAO audit about 15 years ago where the GAO
[00:19:42.677 --> 00:20:00.492]  Put 10 people in a room, gave them all the same tax information, and lo and behold, when the 10 returns were submitted, there were 10 different answers.
[00:20:00.512 --> 00:20:01.393]  So who's right?
[00:20:02.853 --> 00:20:06.695]  And now what we found is they've changed the laws the last three years for CPAs.
[00:20:06.715 --> 00:20:07.736]  You can tell us about that.
[00:20:08.356 --> 00:20:09.757]  Putting burden on you.
[00:20:10.297 --> 00:20:19.603]  And so CPAs I've now found that I keep hiring are trying to make me pay more than I even owe under the fraudulent system because they're scared.
[00:20:19.943 --> 00:20:22.424]  So they just say give all your money to them.
[00:20:22.704 --> 00:20:23.285]  All your money.
[00:20:23.385 --> 00:20:24.185]  Everything must go.
[00:20:25.146 --> 00:20:30.429]  Yeah, what happens is I am now being audited
[00:20:31.229 --> 00:20:39.875]  Under my tax preparer ID number to see my consistency or how I prepare returns.
[00:20:40.675 --> 00:20:57.687]  And if they find something that they believe would be inconsistent to the code, then they come and just attack me as a preparer because I consistently do something that they consider is not correct.
[00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:05.153]  So they audit the preparer as much now as they audit the taxpayer.
[00:21:07.234 --> 00:21:15.740]  Well, let's come back and get into more of the IRS abuse that you've seen, because from all the reports I've seen, they don't even follow due process, nothing.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.801]  They just grab bank accounts, do whatever they want.
[00:21:18.702 --> 00:21:27.888]  Well, unfortunately, that's the case, and it's difficult to properly
[00:21:29.369 --> 00:21:30.870]  We're on the march.
[00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:34.973]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:35.033 --> 00:21:37.454]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:01.892 --> 00:22:05.513]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:22:05.853 --> 00:22:13.974]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:22:14.714 --> 00:22:18.755]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:22:19.335 --> 00:22:30.157]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:22:30.777 --> 00:22:39.800]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:45.342]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:22:45.722 --> 00:22:52.925]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:22:53.225 --> 00:22:55.966]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:22:59.721 --> 00:23:03.964]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:23:04.284 --> 00:23:04.884]  Number one.
[00:23:05.184 --> 00:23:08.346]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:23:08.607 --> 00:23:09.167]  Number two.
[00:23:09.467 --> 00:23:14.030]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:14.810]  It's true.
[00:23:15.111 --> 00:23:19.673]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:23:19.974 --> 00:23:20.434]  Number three.
[00:23:20.794 --> 00:23:24.097]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:23:24.378 --> 00:23:28.862]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:23:29.102 --> 00:23:31.484]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:23:31.865 --> 00:23:35.208]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:23:36.309 --> 00:23:40.251]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:23:40.472 --> 00:23:45.234]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:23:45.515 --> 00:23:49.537]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:23:49.697 --> 00:23:51.258]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:23:51.478 --> 00:23:56.081]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:23:59.443 --> 00:24:03.426]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:24:03.546 --> 00:24:06.289]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:24:06.429 --> 00:24:08.370]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:10.632]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:24:10.752 --> 00:24:12.273]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:24:12.413 --> 00:24:16.737]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:24:16.877 --> 00:24:19.238]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[00:24:19.438 --> 00:24:25.261]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[00:24:25.462 --> 00:24:30.184]  Their best seller, the Ecola Blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[00:24:30.244 --> 00:24:32.986]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[00:24:33.066 --> 00:24:35.707]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[00:24:35.807 --> 00:24:42.951]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[00:24:43.251 --> 00:24:46.935]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling a Coloblue at 1-800-691-6043.
[00:24:46.975 --> 00:24:47.215]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:24:47.235 --> 00:24:49.158]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:25:04.741 --> 00:25:11.328]  Bob Chapman to cover a host of news and the economy in the next hour, then Gerald Cilente who was in Chile for the earthquake.
[00:25:11.348 --> 00:25:16.273]  We'll talk some about that, but mainly his trends forecast for the rest of the year into next year.
[00:25:16.333 --> 00:25:23.680]  Top trends forecaster Wayne Paul, CPA, patriot, in the fetter, brother of Congressman Ron Paul, is our guest.
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.883]  We're going to go back to him in a moment and start taking your phone calls.
[00:25:26.483 --> 00:25:32.966]  I wanted to first, though, thank one of our sponsors, Okola Blue, the atmospheric water generator system.
[00:25:32.986 --> 00:25:43.252]  They have little units that do seven and a half gallons a day that look like a water cooler without the water bottle on top, grabs water out of the air, puts it through a bunch of great filters, very inexpensive, works very, very well.
[00:25:43.992 --> 00:25:46.773]  A lot cheaper than bottled water that you can't guarantee is safe.
[00:25:47.033 --> 00:25:48.874]  There's no fluoride in this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:49.194 --> 00:25:54.717]  acolablue.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com, acolablue.com, or 800-691-6043.
[00:25:55.317 --> 00:25:59.559]  And they've got big units that can supply thousands of people with water.
[00:25:59.939 --> 00:26:01.040]  And they sent some to Haiti.
[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:01.700]  So, 800-691-6043.
[00:26:04.341 --> 00:26:13.824]  Don't forget the online video bookstore where you can check out all the films and books we carry, and the films and books that I've produced and written, all available at InfoWars.com.
[00:26:13.864 --> 00:26:16.764]  And remember, you may know all about the New World Order.
[00:26:17.585 --> 00:26:22.286]  It's about waking somebody up every week, and our numbers have exponentially been growing.
[00:26:22.306 --> 00:26:25.907]  We'll talk about that more with Wayne Paul here in a moment, but going back to Wayne,
[00:26:27.407 --> 00:26:51.180]  I mean the outrages, the news reports of the IRS showing up at a house, seizing it, seizing the furniture, seizing family photos, grabbing wedding rings off women's fingers, people committing suicide, and it's done outside due process and it turns out Rangel's not paying taxes, Geithner the head of the IRS isn't paying taxes, Rangel was the head of the tax committee, it turns out close to half of
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:54.362]  Congress doesn't pay all their taxes, or doesn't pay at all.
[00:26:55.183 --> 00:27:00.607]  The EU bureaucrats wrote the laws where they pay a 17% income tax, and the average European's over 50%.
[00:27:00.687 --> 00:27:03.970]  I mean, this is just so incredibly corrupt.
[00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:09.334]  And when your brother's always on TV, Ron Paul, they'll say, you want to get rid of the income tax, sir?
[00:27:09.394 --> 00:27:10.555]  How will we fund America?
[00:27:11.035 --> 00:27:18.781]  And a lot of times he's at the Capitol, he goes, the Capitol behind me was built a hundred and something years before we even had the income tax.
[00:27:20.422 --> 00:27:21.162]  That's absolutely correct.
[00:27:21.222 --> 00:27:23.243]  And I think the important issue on the Gestapo tactics of the IRS
[00:27:51.117 --> 00:28:00.760]  People should understand that they are the collector of the debt that our government owes the banking system.
[00:28:01.881 --> 00:28:07.503]  And because of that, they feel they don't have to follow the law.
[00:28:07.803 --> 00:28:17.087]  In fact, that's what got me involved in IRS litigation some 35 years ago, because the first guy that walked through my office
[00:28:18.229 --> 00:28:30.813]  After he told me his story, he had a disability retirement, and within five weeks after he came to my office, he had gone back to drinking and he died of sclerosis of the liver.
[00:28:32.313 --> 00:28:39.075]  And I look at that compared to the guy two weeks ago that flew his airplane into the IRS building.
[00:28:39.896 --> 00:28:46.398]  Why is not Congress looking at why this guy did it?
[00:28:48.835 --> 00:29:01.361]  What forces a man, a human being, to such extremes that he says, I've got to put a story out there, I've got to kill myself.
[00:29:02.321 --> 00:29:17.428]  If, you know, Congress ought to be sitting and bouncing up and down on the IRS and say, now wait a minute, what are you guys doing that's causing somebody to get so frustrated and so desperate
[00:29:23.908 --> 00:29:29.391]  Well, our country revolted over taxes a lot lower than what they are right now.
[00:29:30.072 --> 00:29:34.834]  And the people were happy to pay taxes, but they said no taxes without representation.
[00:29:35.455 --> 00:29:38.136]  And also the taxes weren't being equally applied.
[00:29:38.156 --> 00:29:43.219]  That's what really started the Civil War, as you know, in the 1860s.
[00:29:43.299 --> 00:29:45.861]  But I have stacks of news every day.
[00:29:46.661 --> 00:29:53.286]  Where they're increasing the tickets, the fines, the fees, the regulations, taxes on food, taxes on the environment.
[00:29:53.686 --> 00:29:57.529]  A $2.6 billion tax they're trying to pass in Austin in the first three years.
[00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:02.153]  $2.6 billion, that's more than all taxes in Austin in three years combined.
[00:30:03.053 --> 00:30:08.574]  I mean, it's just like cancer, and the only sector hiring is government.
[00:30:09.115 --> 00:30:09.835]  That's admitted.
[00:30:09.955 --> 00:30:16.836]  All the other industries are literally shutting down, and it's like an orgy of criminality of the parasite class.
[00:30:16.876 --> 00:30:18.297]  Where do you see this going, Wayne?
[00:30:18.997 --> 00:30:31.740]  Well, I think by education, by learning, and by people becoming more knowledgeable about the way the system works.
[00:30:32.887 --> 00:30:38.710]  We will eventually see the rights of the people.
[00:30:38.990 --> 00:31:01.720]  They will come back and through election, and we've had one just Tuesday in Texas that even though it was disappointing in some races, it was encouraging in others because there are fundamental constitutional people
[00:31:02.475 --> 00:31:18.206]  That won elections this time around in Texas, and therefore I don't think Governor Perry is going to be able to be as dogmatic and forcible on his liberal ideas as how he wants to run Texas.
[00:31:18.226 --> 00:31:22.869]  You know, he doesn't do anything for protecting the border.
[00:31:23.489 --> 00:31:27.672]  He confiscates our property when it comes to the trans-Texas corridor.
[00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:30.271]  Absolutely, Wayne.
[00:31:30.311 --> 00:31:33.192]  Paul, we're going to some of your calls here in a moment, but
[00:31:52.731 --> 00:31:54.292]  I've got a big stack of this news.
[00:31:54.312 --> 00:31:56.334]  We're going to cover it next hour when Bob Chapman's with us.
[00:31:56.354 --> 00:32:03.819]  I'm also going to break down the obvious staged event at the Pentagon and how they're coming after anyone that questions 9-11.
[00:32:03.919 --> 00:32:05.540]  I mean, this is serious.
[00:32:06.481 --> 00:32:09.323]  Serious what's coming up, so people need to definitely stay with us.
[00:32:10.224 --> 00:32:12.466]  But the Wall Street Journal reports
[00:32:13.502 --> 00:32:15.083]  The end of the internet as we know it.
[00:32:15.564 --> 00:32:17.946]  Wired Magazine says cyber security.
[00:32:18.746 --> 00:32:20.768]  The end of the open free internet.
[00:32:21.148 --> 00:32:22.009]  That's the headline.
[00:32:22.469 --> 00:32:26.933]  So finally the media is paying attention to what we've broken down the last two months.
[00:32:27.213 --> 00:32:30.596]  It's now passed the House, it's in the Senate, of what's in the cyber security bill.
[00:32:30.856 --> 00:32:33.258]  People are finally reading the cyber security bill.
[00:32:33.558 --> 00:32:37.581]  So good job to the audience getting this out to the media that we requested you to do.
[00:32:38.675 --> 00:32:40.057]  It's finally all over the news.
[00:32:40.418 --> 00:32:42.481]  Here's the Drudge Report linking to mainstream news.
[00:32:42.802 --> 00:32:43.823]  Big CIS unleashed.
[00:32:43.843 --> 00:32:47.068]  Homeland Security program digs into all internet communications.
[00:32:47.188 --> 00:32:48.050]  Tracking everything.
[00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:49.151]  No Fourth Amendment.
[00:32:49.432 --> 00:32:51.155]  Feds weigh expansion of monitoring.
[00:32:51.595 --> 00:32:52.897]  UK spy ships hidden in 2.5.
[00:32:54.099 --> 00:32:55.120]  Million trash bins.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:55.841]  Pay as you throw.
[00:32:55.881 --> 00:32:56.641]  Tracking everyone.
[00:32:57.042 --> 00:32:58.523]  Here's Infowars.net.
[00:32:58.543 --> 00:32:59.304]  This just went up.
[00:32:59.724 --> 00:33:00.345]  Steve Watson.
[00:33:00.385 --> 00:33:01.986]  It's also on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:33:02.306 --> 00:33:05.629]  Former Director of National Intelligence calls for re-engineering the internet.
[00:33:05.989 --> 00:33:10.253]  The world is one major cyber event away from total restriction of the web.
[00:33:10.674 --> 00:33:18.460]  They are now openly coming out saying they want to end free speech on the web, Wayne, because they know we're winning the battle for hearts and minds.
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:19.782]  We're waking the people up.
[00:33:20.682 --> 00:33:24.325]  Uh, are you concerned about their open announcements that they want to censor the internet?
[00:33:25.486 --> 00:33:35.334]  Absolutely, because that's our basic freedom and liberty, is to be able to speak those ideas and voice our opinions.
[00:33:35.714 --> 00:33:37.275]  Opinions are always great.
[00:33:38.156 --> 00:33:47.123]  I, you know, I don't have to agree with you to listen to you, but I also have to grant you the right to give me your opinion and your thoughts.
[00:33:47.303 --> 00:33:50.025]  I think that is a basic
[00:33:50.674 --> 00:34:07.525]  The constitutional right that we have, and any attempt to stop that over the internet, should absolutely be 600% opposed by every human being that walks the face of the earth today.
[00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.749]  Absolutely.
[00:34:10.809 --> 00:34:14.910]  I'm digging around here in my stack for that Wall Street Journal headline.
[00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:26.752]  I've also got Wired Magazine admitting that total censorship of the web now being set up, where the Pentagon will run every internet distribution system, openly talking about censorship.
[00:34:27.173 --> 00:34:30.053]  I mean, these are very, very desperate times.
[00:34:30.653 --> 00:34:38.755]  Wayne, I want to go to calls and go into the different issues that they're going to raise, but while we've got you here today, talking about your brother, Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:34:40.034 --> 00:34:42.681]  Watching him in and out of Congress in the last 30 years.
[00:34:43.383 --> 00:34:46.652]  First went there in the 80s for a short stint and came back in the 90s.
[00:34:48.462 --> 00:34:52.784]  Going from no one co-sponsoring his bills to his bills now passing the House.
[00:34:53.264 --> 00:35:00.306]  We've gone from maybe 1% of Americans knowing the Federal Reserve is private to some polls over 90% wanting to audit it or abolish it.
[00:35:00.926 --> 00:35:08.629]  It's exponentially growing to see him get an 84% approval rating in Texas, 80 plus percent of the vote in the Republican primary.
[00:35:08.649 --> 00:35:12.670]  To see constitutionalist Molden and your brothers
[00:35:14.611 --> 00:35:17.434]  I think it is one of the most amazing things.
[00:35:17.614 --> 00:35:20.277]  As you know, I have four older brothers, Ron being one of them.
[00:35:39.725 --> 00:35:54.877]  It's amazing to me, I've been the closest to Ron in terms of philosophy, understanding, and learning as it relates to privacy, as it relates to liberty.
[00:35:55.657 --> 00:36:04.624]  But it was fascinating to see the other three brothers listen to him and slowly absorb what he was saying.
[00:36:06.385 --> 00:36:14.249]  They have turned around and learned a lot over the last two years in terms of what Ron's been able to do.
[00:36:14.809 --> 00:36:26.094]  And he absolutely is a beacon of a shining light out there for other people to look at, follow, learn and understand from.
[00:36:26.114 --> 00:36:35.659]  And when he started 35 years ago, he said, I'm just, I want to do this for educational purposes.
[00:36:36.821 --> 00:36:47.666]  I don't think I'll ever make a difference, but if I can get one more people to understand, or one more person to understand what I understand, this country will be better off.
[00:36:49.927 --> 00:36:51.748]  And I think that's happening today.
[00:36:52.281 --> 00:36:56.945]  Well it's another testament to what one person taking action and joining with others can do.
[00:36:57.326 --> 00:37:15.043]  We have the long view of history and take our country, county, city, state, federal back and put out the truth versus the controlled corporate system and big government systems lies and in the end their tyranny will not stand no matter how many police, how many black helicopters, how many cameras,
[00:37:15.583 --> 00:37:16.485]  How many spies?
[00:37:16.545 --> 00:37:17.487]  How much surveillance?
[00:37:17.868 --> 00:37:19.011]  False flag terror?
[00:37:19.472 --> 00:37:21.396]  None of it is going to hold this together.
[00:37:21.436 --> 00:37:25.645]  And we can see the momentum shifting against them right now.
[00:37:27.737 --> 00:37:30.398]  Looking at what your brother's been able to do, what you've been able to do.
[00:37:31.678 --> 00:37:43.240]  But I just wonder, because I'm 36 years old and I get exhausted doing four hours a day working on films, reading legislation, doing other interviews, and I say no to most interviews now.
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:54.282]  I don't know how your brother, at what, 74 years old, how he, because I happen to know a lot about his schedule, I mean the guy is working 14, 15, 16 hours a day
[00:37:57.003 --> 00:37:58.704]  Well, I think he's excited about the prospects
[00:38:25.889 --> 00:38:37.438]  He's excited about the young people learning about liberty, and he just feels that that's where our future lies.
[00:38:37.799 --> 00:38:49.768]  And I give the example of a local family here that I know personally whose son graduated from high school this year, and he's 17 years old.
[00:38:51.653 --> 00:38:59.435]  And his thesis paper for his senior year was written on the Federal Reserve.
[00:39:00.135 --> 00:39:19.061]  He then had to give a talk in front of—he had to defend his thesis in front of the parents and in front of his classmates as to why he felt as he did.
[00:39:20.137 --> 00:39:31.190]  Now, when I was a senior in high school, I wouldn't have had a clue as to what to talk about, but here's a 17-year-old that's read more books than every book that Ron's ever printed.
[00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:37.457]  And there's millions and there's millions in high school learning about the New World Order and learning about liberty and freedom.
[00:39:37.737 --> 00:39:39.339]  That's why the globalists are so scared.
[00:39:40.939 --> 00:39:52.011]  In fact, I talked to Daniel Estillan, who really does have sources in Bilderberg, I even know their names off record, and he said in 2006, they were deathly afraid of Ron Paul.
[00:39:52.071 --> 00:39:52.511]  Then again in 2008.
[00:39:54.289 --> 00:39:55.770]  Absolutely, there's no doubt about it.
[00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:57.110]  And if you take a look
[00:40:23.089 --> 00:40:29.612]  We just had an election in the state representative race in the 7th district.
[00:40:30.692 --> 00:40:44.797]  A gentleman by the name of David Simpson beat in a primary an incumbent of seven terms, who in my opinion is a typical rhino, and he got defeated.
[00:40:45.558 --> 00:40:48.399]  And I think that's totally encouraging.
[00:40:49.127 --> 00:40:56.588]  It's something that I think is fantastic for everybody to see and witness the changes that are taking place.
[00:40:56.968 --> 00:40:58.749]  Let me throw this out there, then we're going to calls.
[00:41:00.989 --> 00:41:13.231]  In internal White House memos, Cass Sunstein memos, White House regulations are in congressional hearings, in internal Bilderberg group meetings, their number one thing they talk about is U.S.
[00:41:13.271 --> 00:41:15.692]  patriots and our ideas spreading worldwide.
[00:41:17.031 --> 00:41:24.816]  We are the only thing standing between the globalist and world domination and the hellish eugenic system they want to set up.
[00:41:25.176 --> 00:41:27.978]  I want listeners to really have a gut check moment.
[00:41:28.018 --> 00:41:29.419]  That's not rhetoric you just heard.
[00:41:29.439 --> 00:41:30.139]  That's not hype.
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.600]  This is the truth.
[00:41:32.441 --> 00:41:38.244]  We are all that stands between humanity and absolute dehumanization.
[00:41:39.005 --> 00:41:44.388]  This is the most scientific, most wicked group humanity has ever faced.
[00:41:45.862 --> 00:41:51.466]  We are having an effect to the point of, in their top councils, they are afraid.
[00:41:51.686 --> 00:41:56.650]  Because they know that we know that they are a pack of criminals and illegitimate.
[00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:02.654]  And if we keep carrying this message, and if they can't demonize us, which they're trying to do, they're going down.
[00:42:03.615 --> 00:42:04.836]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[00:42:04.916 --> 00:42:06.437]  Patton, California, you're on the air.
[00:42:07.253 --> 00:42:08.093]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:42:08.453 --> 00:42:09.074]  Good, go ahead.
[00:42:09.474 --> 00:42:10.474]  Okay, hey, real quick.
[00:42:10.514 --> 00:42:14.895]  You had a gentleman on yesterday, the Marine, who said he was kind of like re-adapt and was kind of set up.
[00:42:15.255 --> 00:42:20.437]  Now hey, just, I want to use him for presence because basically I'm a union plumber laid off, San Jose.
[00:42:20.737 --> 00:42:22.138]  They told us no work for two years.
[00:42:22.158 --> 00:42:27.459]  They're going to try to jam this health care bill down our throat with what, three hundred and something taxes.
[00:42:27.959 --> 00:42:29.160]  Everybody's losing their job.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:29.840]  There's no work.
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.900]  That then takes the union health care you paid for.
[00:42:32.621 --> 00:42:34.041]  Yeah, oh, it's unbelievable.
[00:42:34.181 --> 00:42:35.402]  I pay $10.46 an hour.
[00:42:35.562 --> 00:42:36.242]  It's ridiculous.
[00:42:36.662 --> 00:42:36.862]  I know.
[00:42:37.951 --> 00:42:40.174]  But what I see is, who's going to pay for this?
[00:42:40.654 --> 00:42:41.535]  Are they insane?
[00:42:41.635 --> 00:42:48.242]  I really believe that we need to peacefully get up, if they pass this health care bill, and get to the streets peacefully and say, this is enough.
[00:42:48.522 --> 00:42:49.083]  All right, stay there.
[00:42:49.103 --> 00:42:50.084]  I'm going to come back to you, Pat.
[00:42:50.104 --> 00:42:51.445]  Let you finish up and go to Wayne Paul.
[00:42:51.465 --> 00:42:52.947]  We're going to keep him five minutes to the next hour.
[00:42:52.987 --> 00:42:53.567]  We can do that.
[00:42:53.868 --> 00:42:57.351]  Then we're going to get Bob Chapman on for news blitzes and the economy.
[00:42:58.132 --> 00:42:58.713]  We'll be right back.
[00:43:00.822 --> 00:43:02.082]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:43:02.122 --> 00:43:07.484]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:43:07.704 --> 00:43:12.345]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:43:12.725 --> 00:43:17.787]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:43:18.307 --> 00:43:22.988]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[00:44:00.754 --> 00:44:06.498]  Did you know there is a growing number of researchers who agree that 90% of all disease begins in the colon?
[00:44:06.578 --> 00:44:11.622]  Did you know that 80% of all Americans suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[00:44:11.802 --> 00:44:14.484]  If allowed, our bodies are capable of healing themselves.

[00:45:59.908 --> 00:46:08.892]  A month or so ago, I announced that we were going to have a $15,000 contest.
[00:46:08.932 --> 00:46:09.833]  Our biggest ever.
[00:46:10.813 --> 00:46:11.794]  Three separate contests.
[00:46:11.814 --> 00:46:12.294]  One $10,000, one $3,000, one $2,000.
[00:46:15.782 --> 00:46:23.462]  You've got until April 10th to go read the contest, go out and have a demonstration, protest, or it could be anything.
[00:46:24.511 --> 00:46:27.352]  And then we'll judge the videos, and then you'll win $10,000, $3,000, and $2,000.
[00:46:27.932 --> 00:46:34.954]  It's already scrolled off the main page on InfoWars.com to the News in Focus archive, featured news archive.
[00:46:34.974 --> 00:46:36.134]  But you can go find the article.
[00:46:36.154 --> 00:46:40.975]  We're going to put links up in the next few days to the official contest page, some banners.
[00:46:41.555 --> 00:46:43.276]  And everybody wins entering this contest.
[00:46:43.436 --> 00:46:50.757]  Everybody wins because you make a video, you go out and have a protest, and then the word gets out about the naked body scanners.
[00:46:50.817 --> 00:46:52.538]  But going back to Pat.
[00:46:54.485 --> 00:46:56.406]  Pat, I understand you can't be pushed any further.
[00:46:56.446 --> 00:47:00.489]  You don't have money to pay 800 cities plus or sanctuary cities.
[00:47:00.529 --> 00:47:03.831]  The illegals don't get arrested for no driver's license or insurance or drunk driving.
[00:47:04.291 --> 00:47:04.892]  You do.
[00:47:05.852 --> 00:47:11.536]  They're saying they're going to take, even if they make you lose your job, they're going to take your money that they made union people pay into
[00:47:12.396 --> 00:47:13.277]  And I think that is true.
[00:47:13.297 --> 00:47:14.858]  You want to have peaceful, resistant,
[00:47:42.154 --> 00:47:52.982]  Using liberty and freedom as your basis, and you want to oppose the tyranny that's being put upon us by our present government.
[00:47:53.822 --> 00:48:02.628]  They would just assume that you turn around and try to riot in the streets, then they would have an excuse to put us all in prison.
[00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:06.891]  But the answer is peaceful resistance
[00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:18.362]  Through education and voicing the right of liberty through the Constitution, creating the freedoms we need to live on a daily basis.
[00:48:18.743 --> 00:48:28.885]  But what Pat's saying is, what happens as he goes bankrupt and they show up to throw him out of his house when they're taxing him for a banker bailout that was never used for his house?
[00:48:28.925 --> 00:48:32.866]  I mean, what happens when we have ten times as many homeless people on the street?
[00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:44.581]  I don't have an answer for that because that's a real possibility and it's something that we have to individually help each other as much as possible.
[00:48:44.621 --> 00:48:48.685]  We're going to find communities taking care of communities pretty soon.
[00:48:49.306 --> 00:48:53.050]  The wealthiest nation in the world, the apple of the planet's eye,
[00:48:54.278 --> 00:48:59.701]  In just a few decades, taken over like Nigeria or Greece and bankrupted by the criminal banks.
[00:48:59.761 --> 00:49:02.282]  I mean, this has been a premeditated heist.
[00:49:03.382 --> 00:49:04.223]  Anything else, Pat?
[00:49:05.143 --> 00:49:06.263]  Hey, Pat.
[00:49:06.283 --> 00:49:07.644]  Yeah, sorry about that, Alex.
[00:49:08.104 --> 00:49:11.646]  Two weeks ago, I went to the courthouse to stop my house at auction.
[00:49:12.401 --> 00:49:12.721]  Okay.
[00:49:12.981 --> 00:49:14.122]  I filed a civil suit.
[00:49:14.462 --> 00:49:17.923]  People don't know the rules about asking for the original docs and all that.
[00:49:17.943 --> 00:49:20.904]  And I was talking out loud and next to me was the guy in a suit.
[00:49:21.004 --> 00:49:22.925]  So I started talking to him about the Federal Reserve.
[00:49:22.945 --> 00:49:26.346]  Ended up he was from Chase, one of the guys supposed to buy my house.
[00:49:26.686 --> 00:49:28.887]  And I said, people understand what's going on.
[00:49:28.987 --> 00:49:30.667]  And he looked at me and says, 90% of them have no clue.
[00:49:33.143 --> 00:49:34.885]  So, I did what you said yesterday.
[00:49:34.985 --> 00:49:39.789]  I printed out pages of InfoWars, fought the Republic about fluoride, etc.
[00:49:40.109 --> 00:49:46.034]  I handed out 75 and 45 minutes, and I have my Obama Joker shirt with New World Order.
[00:49:46.294 --> 00:49:50.418]  People are waking up, but we have to push more and more and let more people know.
[00:49:50.858 --> 00:49:52.920]  And if everybody does that, it's unstoppable.
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:53.520]  Thanks, Pat.
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:54.701]  Quick comment from Jacob.
[00:49:54.721 --> 00:49:57.223]  We'll come back and comment one more segment with Wayne Paul.
[00:49:57.444 --> 00:49:58.945]  Jacob, New York, you're on the air.
[00:50:02.113 --> 00:50:03.415]  Just got a quick little rant here.
[00:50:04.737 --> 00:50:12.309]  You know, I got in trouble when I was a kid, and that felony caused me not to be able to vote, not to have any say in this government, and it just sickens me that...
[00:50:12.833 --> 00:50:19.275]  This country is being ran by criminals and I can't even express my word in government because of one mistake when I was a child.
[00:50:19.295 --> 00:50:20.296]  And that's all I gotta say, Alex.
[00:50:20.316 --> 00:50:21.076]  Thanks for having me on.
[00:50:21.776 --> 00:50:22.877]  I appreciate your call.
[00:50:22.937 --> 00:50:26.298]  And now the government's passing laws where you can't have burglar bars in your house.
[00:50:26.978 --> 00:50:29.819]  Again, anything you can imagine a criminal government would do.
[00:50:29.839 --> 00:50:30.740]  Get in their mindset.
[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:33.841]  If you're a criminal and you run things, what would you do?
[00:50:34.121 --> 00:50:35.121]  And then that's what they're doing.
[00:50:35.662 --> 00:50:36.882]  It's just, it's unbelievable.
[00:50:37.162 --> 00:50:38.823]  Back in 70 Seconds with Wayne Paul.
[00:50:42.481 --> 00:50:43.862]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:52:04.772 --> 00:52:05.413]  Big Brother.
[00:52:06.073 --> 00:52:07.154]  Mainstream media.
[00:52:07.834 --> 00:52:09.014]  Government cover-ups.
[00:52:09.595 --> 00:52:10.435]  You want answers?
[00:52:11.155 --> 00:52:12.156]  Well, so does he.
[00:52:12.736 --> 00:52:16.458]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:16.918 --> 00:52:20.980]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:52:25.014 --> 00:52:29.735]  When Wayne Paul was on six months ago, he couldn't get into it, but he has a case with the IRS himself.
[00:52:30.115 --> 00:52:31.576]  He wants to tell you about that now.
[00:52:31.856 --> 00:52:32.956]  Then Bob Chapman's coming up.
[00:52:33.036 --> 00:52:35.957]  Wayne, break down your saga with these scallywags.
[00:52:38.018 --> 00:52:54.222]  Approximately six months ago, I was asked to be a witness in a trial in federal court in Las Vegas, Nevada, dealing with 17 people who were contracting with each other under
[00:52:54.844 --> 00:53:02.287]  A gold and silver coin contract, which is authorized under Title 31 of the U.S.
[00:53:02.347 --> 00:53:02.707]  Code.
[00:53:03.687 --> 00:53:11.850]  At that time, or prior to that time, of those 17, 13 were acquitted by a jury.
[00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:16.572]  The remaining three or four had hung jury.
[00:53:17.732 --> 00:53:22.874]  And the government came back six months ago now and tried these people.
[00:53:23.982 --> 00:53:27.766]  For willful failure to file a tax return.
[00:53:29.308 --> 00:53:36.455]  And it's all based upon the fact that you and I can have an agreement to do a work.
[00:53:37.236 --> 00:53:43.102]  I can hire Alex to film me and I'll pay him $50 in coin money.
[00:53:46.548 --> 00:53:55.734]  And there's even a congressional law, even the Las Vegas Review-Journal admitted, what, from the 80s, stating that you're absolutely allowed to do that.
[00:53:56.014 --> 00:53:56.334]  Sure.
[00:53:57.155 --> 00:53:58.275]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:53:58.475 --> 00:53:59.496]  It's 1985.
[00:54:01.077 --> 00:54:10.503]  And that was the Gold Bullion Act and the Silver Eagle Act, which was the two
[00:54:14.047 --> 00:54:38.641]  And what happened since then is, in the case that I witnessed, that I was a witness for, I spent about seven and a half hours, over two days, on the stand as a witness for one of the defendants.
[00:54:39.862 --> 00:54:41.203]  And I pointed out the
[00:54:42.614 --> 00:54:44.616]  The, uh, Congressional Act.
[00:54:45.136 --> 00:54:48.159]  I pointed out, uh, Title 31 of the U.S.
[00:54:48.219 --> 00:54:49.920]  Code, which is money and banking.
[00:54:50.781 --> 00:54:59.168]  I pointed out the four or five, uh, tax cases that are available.
[00:54:59.188 --> 00:55:06.995]  There's an 1899 tax case that... And you helped him win, and then now suddenly you're being audited as a CPA.
[00:55:07.355 --> 00:55:10.398]  Yeah, well, that's standard procedure, I believe.
[00:55:10.779 --> 00:55:14.381]  Well, take a treasury agent who found out it was all a scam.
[00:55:14.661 --> 00:55:16.703]  He testified in some court cases for people.
[00:55:17.183 --> 00:55:21.566]  Joe Bannister, they indicted him, tried to put him in prison, but the jury let him go.
[00:55:21.806 --> 00:55:25.288]  So the good news is more and more juries are learning the truth.
[00:55:25.868 --> 00:55:39.217]  That is absolutely right, but that's all part of education and all part of the quiet resistance that we need to have in everything that we do.
[00:55:41.567 --> 00:55:42.828]  You got one minute left, Wayne.
[00:55:42.848 --> 00:55:44.509]  We really appreciate you spending time with us.
[00:55:44.609 --> 00:55:45.650]  More on that case.
[00:55:46.290 --> 00:55:55.656]  Well, I would like to, if it's alright with you, Alex, I would like to put out a website that people could go look at.
[00:55:56.216 --> 00:55:56.777]  Absolutely.
[00:55:57.117 --> 00:56:02.080]  It's called GoldIsTheSolution.com.
[00:56:03.841 --> 00:56:06.723]  GoldIsTheSolution.com.
[00:56:09.139 --> 00:56:20.605]  And you can read about that court case and learn what's been going on in that because that case is now up on appeals.
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:25.942]  Well, for those that don't know, and I got Bob Chapman online, but I'm sure he's fine if he holds a few minutes.
[00:56:25.982 --> 00:56:39.407]  He can come back, Wayne, because I do want you to flesh this out now that you bring it up, because whether you're for a gold-backed currency or not, under law, you can engage in commerce like a lot of people do.
[00:56:41.377 --> 00:56:51.351]  through gold and silver and get outside the fiat money system and the IRS is trying to say no you can't have this form of constitutional really bartered.
[00:56:52.188 --> 00:56:55.810]  It's like saying you can't pay your neighbor in animal crackers if you agree with it.
[00:56:56.591 --> 00:56:56.951]  Stay there.
[00:56:56.971 --> 00:56:58.232]  Let me talk to you during the break.
[00:56:58.512 --> 00:57:00.033]  And we're coming back with Bob Chapman.
[00:57:00.113 --> 00:57:05.457]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[00:57:05.477 --> 00:57:08.199]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:57:08.239 --> 00:57:12.581]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:57:13.562 --> 00:57:18.005]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[00:57:59.943 --> 00:58:04.185]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:04.505 --> 00:58:05.126]  Number one.
[00:58:05.406 --> 00:58:08.568]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:08.828 --> 00:58:09.408]  Number two.
[00:58:09.688 --> 00:58:14.251]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:58:14.591 --> 00:58:15.051]  It's true.
[00:58:15.331 --> 00:58:19.874]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:58:20.194 --> 00:58:20.735]  Number 3.
[00:58:21.015 --> 00:58:24.298]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:58:24.598 --> 00:58:28.341]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:58:28.522 --> 00:58:28.782]  Number 4.
[00:58:29.322 --> 00:58:31.684]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:58:32.085 --> 00:58:35.468]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:58:35.768 --> 00:58:35.968]  Number 5.
[00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:40.472]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:58:40.693 --> 00:58:45.457]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:06.521]  That produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:59:06.641 --> 00:59:07.882]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:59:07.922 --> 00:59:08.602]  It's very real.
[00:59:08.742 --> 00:59:10.863]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.

[01:00:00.718 --> 01:00:06.261]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:08.064 --> 01:00:11.806]  Alright, doing a few more minutes with Wayne Ball, because this issue he brought up is so important.
[01:00:12.086 --> 01:00:19.850]  It's a case I followed closely, and I didn't know he was ready to talk about it, because at the time, being involved in the court case as an expert witness, he didn't want to discuss it.
[01:00:20.570 --> 01:00:22.231]  I should have gotten to it earlier in the interview.
[01:00:22.591 --> 01:00:26.773]  Another expert on gold and currency in the markets is Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster.
[01:00:27.194 --> 01:00:28.654]  I'm Alex Jones of Infowars.com.
[01:00:30.055 --> 01:00:40.027]  And under federal law 1985 and there's other congressional laws, you can trade in gold and silver and pay people in its face value.
[01:00:40.067 --> 01:00:44.553]  So it's a $10 coin worth in Federal Reserve notes say $550 right now or $600 or more.
[01:00:50.049 --> 01:00:55.492]  Then the supposed tax rate of that would be 20 or 30 or whatever the percentage is of that amount.
[01:00:55.752 --> 01:00:58.613]  But then some experts look at it and say, no, it's not even taxable.
[01:00:59.273 --> 01:01:04.195]  Regardless, Wayne Paul went and was an expert witness and now they're auditing him.
[01:01:04.616 --> 01:01:06.797]  This is what an evil, oppressive,
[01:01:07.757 --> 01:01:08.278]  Well, I... When I...
[01:01:36.877 --> 01:01:42.521]  With the witness, I also prepared the tax return for the defendant.
[01:01:43.762 --> 01:01:56.491]  And he had instructions from a federal judge that he had to prepare a return based upon the fair market value of the coins he received.
[01:01:58.073 --> 01:02:05.358]  And I turned around and said, as a professional, I had to prepare it based on the face value.
[01:02:06.423 --> 01:02:11.225]  So I prepared two tax returns for the defendant.
[01:02:11.485 --> 01:02:12.745]  Because that's the federal law.
[01:02:12.805 --> 01:02:17.887]  You were following the congressional law, and in the Constitution, it's the Congress that's over that.
[01:02:18.147 --> 01:02:21.509]  They're the boss, not the IRS that works for foreign banks.
[01:02:21.849 --> 01:02:36.054]  So I prepared two returns, and we couldn't decide what to do, so we sent them to the, the attorney sent them to the IRS, so the IRS would tell us which was the correct one, and guess what?
[01:02:36.696 --> 01:02:38.437]  They never answered our question.
[01:02:39.658 --> 01:02:46.082]  And so at trial, the prosecuting attorney says, why did you turn around and prepare a two-tax return?
[01:02:47.182 --> 01:02:50.544]  And I said, well, that's a dumb question, but I'll answer it anyway.
[01:02:51.465 --> 01:03:04.613]  I said, the judge here, and I pointed to the judge next to me, I said, he said the defendant had it prepared on fair market value, and I said I had it prepared based upon what the law said.
[01:03:05.533 --> 01:03:06.074]  And I said,
[01:03:07.255 --> 01:03:14.539]  Mr. Prosecutor, if you were sitting in the defendant's chair, wouldn't you want to have all the ammunition you could get in order to defend yourself?
[01:03:15.939 --> 01:03:23.703]  And, of course, he didn't like that as an answer, but I think a few people in the courtroom understood what I was trying to say.
[01:03:23.723 --> 01:03:28.465]  Well, cutting to the chase here, because this is so important, what was the outcome of the case?
[01:03:29.225 --> 01:03:32.907]  The outcome of the case is one person was
[01:03:36.184 --> 01:03:37.465]  He's acquitted.
[01:03:38.926 --> 01:03:50.074]  The other one that I was a witness for got sentenced to four years, but is out on bond pending appeal.
[01:03:50.714 --> 01:04:05.144]  The third gentleman got something like 20 years, and he's in jail, but everything's under appeal right now going up to the Federal, I believe it's the Fifth Circuit if I'm not
[01:04:06.132 --> 01:04:06.693]  Unbelievable.
[01:04:06.713 --> 01:04:09.455]  Let's bring Bob Chapman up, talking about this.
[01:04:09.495 --> 01:04:16.722]  Bob, from your research, talking with Wayne Paul, CPA, and brother of Ron Paul, the Congressman, what's your take on this whole case?
[01:04:18.103 --> 01:04:21.306]  Well, they don't care what the Constitution says.
[01:04:22.948 --> 01:04:26.671]  They have their own method of operating the court system.
[01:04:27.692 --> 01:04:31.216]  And unfortunately, you have no rights.
[01:04:32.484 --> 01:04:32.584]  And
[01:04:53.116 --> 01:04:54.077]  A good day in court.
[01:04:54.537 --> 01:04:56.378]  Yeah, we had the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
[01:04:56.939 --> 01:05:00.321]  The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals two weeks ago ruled there's no Fourth Amendment.
[01:05:00.741 --> 01:05:04.203]  Police can come in your house without a warrant now with no probable cause.
[01:05:04.243 --> 01:05:05.184]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:05:06.484 --> 01:05:11.047]  Well, what it's going to lead to, unfortunately, ultimately, is probably anarchy.
[01:05:11.888 --> 01:05:15.830]  And, you know, maybe that's the intention of the power behind government.
[01:05:16.771 --> 01:05:21.794]  I personally, because of my political activities, was audited 12 years in a row.
[01:05:23.797 --> 01:05:25.979]  And I never was found to owe tax.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:28.642]  And, of course, that's illegal.
[01:05:29.663 --> 01:05:38.272]  Because if they find that you do not own tax, they can't audit you on the same items for the following three years.
[01:05:38.612 --> 01:05:39.313]  They do it anyway.
[01:05:40.011 --> 01:05:42.932]  Well, that's like, you know, the Government Accounting Office and others.
[01:05:43.112 --> 01:05:46.393]  Eighty-plus percent of the letters they send, they're wrong.
[01:05:46.753 --> 01:05:48.534]  Even in their fraudulent system, they're wrong.
[01:05:48.814 --> 01:05:50.535]  And then they never get in trouble for it.
[01:05:51.355 --> 01:05:55.756]  And then when they audit you and it costs you all this money to go through the audit, they don't get in trouble.
[01:05:55.776 --> 01:06:01.258]  But as a private citizen, you frivolously sue somebody, you can be opened up to serious liability.
[01:06:01.278 --> 01:06:04.239]  I mean, this is just a lawless, disgusting, filthy group.
[01:06:04.259 --> 01:06:06.360]  We'll talk to Wayne Paul again soon.
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:09.021]  As this case continues to unfold.
[01:06:09.081 --> 01:06:13.203]  Wayne, we appreciate your great courage and your tireless fight against the New World Order.
[01:06:13.704 --> 01:06:14.364]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:06:14.544 --> 01:06:15.245]  I appreciate it.
[01:06:15.685 --> 01:06:16.485]  Have a great weekend.
[01:06:16.825 --> 01:06:17.025]  Thanks.
[01:06:18.066 --> 01:06:19.867]  Say how to run for me next week, okay?
[01:06:20.327 --> 01:06:20.788]  I'll do it.
[01:06:21.348 --> 01:06:22.148]  Alright, take care.
[01:06:22.248 --> 01:06:23.609]  There he goes, another great Texan.
[01:06:24.129 --> 01:06:25.970]  Okay, going back to Bob Chapman.
[01:06:27.351 --> 01:06:28.272]  With us for the rest of the hour.
[01:06:28.332 --> 01:06:34.375]  Bob, there's so much I want to cover here, but every week we get you on in the third hour and I just have to say,
[01:06:35.683 --> 01:06:37.284]  How do you call it?
[01:06:37.664 --> 01:06:42.968]  I mean, I've seen no expert, not Nobel Prize winner Stiklitz, not even Dr. Paul Gregg-Robertson.
[01:06:42.988 --> 01:06:43.868]  He's been very accurate.
[01:06:43.908 --> 01:07:03.541]  Not... I mean, Gerald Salengi does a great job on trends, but the way you specifically, two years ago, called how the bailout would happen, and then how they'd come back in 2010 and try to fully bankrupt the planet, eight months ago, how they were planning to bring down, starting with Spain and
[01:07:04.762 --> 01:07:28.398]  Greece and then 14 other nations, that's now the media's now... I was listening to Bloomberg Financial last night and this morning on the radio on my XM, I am serious, it was like Bob Chapman was talking but they were snickering and giggling and saying how great it was and how the banks have record profits and how they've gotten more power and they're just laughing on CNBC and everywhere else.
[01:07:29.739 --> 01:07:33.402]  They're saying Greece may have to give the private IMF, World Bank and EU
[01:07:34.082 --> 01:07:35.483]  Bankers, they're islands.
[01:07:36.184 --> 01:07:37.745]  Islands that are large parts of Greece.
[01:07:37.825 --> 01:07:38.966]  It's an island to begin with.
[01:07:39.706 --> 01:07:43.870]  Goldman Sachs, it's come out 10 years ago, and you wrote about this 10 years ago, engineered this.
[01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:46.091]  Now they are fully running the country.
[01:07:46.632 --> 01:07:49.694]  The same things that were done to the third world are now being done here.
[01:07:50.174 --> 01:07:52.096]  They're openly announcing their Bank of the World.
[01:07:52.236 --> 01:07:54.618]  World government taking over in the next 16 months.
[01:07:55.178 --> 01:07:56.840]  Carbon taxes on everyone.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:58.521]  It's coming out.
[01:07:58.581 --> 01:08:01.623]  Police have quotas to arrest innocent people, give out tickets.
[01:08:02.224 --> 01:08:03.184]  I mean, it is just...
[01:08:04.025 --> 01:08:09.389]  It is hellish, and it's one thing to know this is coming, it's another thing to see it happening.
[01:08:09.690 --> 01:08:13.993]  So Bob, how do you do it A, and B, what's coming next now?
[01:08:15.654 --> 01:08:32.908]  Well, first of all, I do a terrific amount of research, and you know, I've been reading and writing for 50 years, and so I'm very gifted in the fact that I have a photographic memory, and I remember little details that happened many, many years ago.
[01:08:33.838 --> 01:08:34.739]  Even statistics.
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:38.784]  And so I've got a God-given gift.
[01:08:39.645 --> 01:08:47.734]  And so I'm able to put together a lot of things that other people can't put together because they don't have that equipment.
[01:08:48.415 --> 01:08:51.819]  But it really, really takes a lot of hard work.
[01:08:54.159 --> 01:09:00.445]  You were just speaking about the situation in Greece and Europe, which we discussed last week.
[01:09:01.305 --> 01:09:03.968]  And what you wrote about ten years ago.
[01:09:04.068 --> 01:09:07.010]  You said Greece would be the first to go ten years ago.
[01:09:08.412 --> 01:09:11.895]  Yeah, well not only that, I thought Italy would be right with them.
[01:09:11.915 --> 01:09:14.477]  And I don't think they're going to be far behind.
[01:09:15.097 --> 01:09:21.463]  One of the reasons is that Italy, I believe, and of course it's a secret, I think they leased out
[01:09:23.768 --> 01:09:28.277]  Which is tantamount to selling more than half the gold that they had.
[01:09:28.297 --> 01:09:30.662]  And I think it's long gone.
[01:09:31.662 --> 01:09:35.083]  And so they're in a worse position than they were 10 years ago.
[01:09:35.243 --> 01:10:00.507]  And by the way, 15 years ago, you and many others and myself 14 years ago exposed that the UN takes over national parks and land and roads for the IMF and World Bank and that deals have been signed for the US and when they sold out 25 ports two years ago they admitted this was part of that and now they're telling Greece give us your islands and your infrastructure and now we've got the leader of the Democrats in the Senate saying they're going to do that here in the United States!
[01:10:04.749 --> 01:10:05.409]  Absolutely.
[01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:11.592]  I think what's going to happen in Europe is that the U.S.
[01:10:11.632 --> 01:10:19.435]  will secretly be the largest donor to the bailout, followed by France and Germany, unfortunately for them.
[01:10:20.436 --> 01:10:24.977]  And the so-called bailout will just be our tax money buying Greece to give it to the bankers?
[01:10:26.178 --> 01:10:26.418]  Right.
[01:10:26.498 --> 01:10:28.199]  And I don't think they'll give up their islands.
[01:10:29.251 --> 01:10:31.872]  But it was brought up, there's no question.
[01:10:32.392 --> 01:10:37.293]  And of course the Greeks brought up the question of German gold, and the Greeks got the gold back.
[01:10:38.153 --> 01:10:42.114]  And it's in this issue coming out tomorrow of the International Forecast.
[01:10:42.134 --> 01:10:47.215]  There was a letter to the editor, someone wrote to me and described how the whole thing went.
[01:10:48.375 --> 01:10:56.637]  And so the explanations by the Greeks are untrue.
[01:10:58.107 --> 01:11:02.169]  I've seen the other side of the story as well, so let's just put it this way.
[01:11:02.609 --> 01:11:03.510]  It's up for debate.
[01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:05.570]  There's two sides to that story.
[01:11:06.251 --> 01:11:23.898]  But what's going to happen is, and the reason the bankers did this, that down the road here, in a year or two, there's 19 countries who are either in bankruptcy but not declared.
[01:11:24.518 --> 01:11:27.059]  I guess the only one that might be declared is Iceland.
[01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:39.848]  And are on the edge like the United States and Great Britain and perhaps Ireland and Spain and Portugal as well and perhaps even Italy.
[01:11:40.008 --> 01:11:43.350]  The point is they're going to gather them all together and have their big meeting.
[01:11:44.313 --> 01:11:47.114]  And they're going to realign all the currencies.
[01:11:47.915 --> 01:11:50.876]  There'll be domestic devaluations all over the world.
[01:11:51.336 --> 01:11:51.776]  Stay there.
[01:11:51.816 --> 01:11:54.217]  Let's start over on the big world government.
[01:11:54.518 --> 01:11:59.340]  The bankers bankrupt everybody through fraud and then say we rule the planet.
[01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:07.063]  In today's world, a product comes along that revolutionizes the way we live, work and play.
[01:12:11.969 --> 01:12:15.171]  Max Fit makes your hands go wow.

[01:14:13.848 --> 01:14:20.050]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:14:20.230 --> 01:14:25.272]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:14:25.432 --> 01:14:35.395]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:14:35.535 --> 01:14:37.636]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:14:37.876 --> 01:14:39.217]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:14:39.457 --> 01:14:41.738]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:14:41.919 --> 01:14:43.760]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:48.842]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:16:03.661 --> 01:16:09.963]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's no doubt that the media is saying the 9-11 truth during the shooting at the Pentagon yesterday.
[01:16:10.363 --> 01:16:14.224]  I've been predicting this because I saw them prepping the public for it.
[01:16:14.264 --> 01:16:16.565]  I'm going to break it down with Bob coming up in the next segment.
[01:16:17.025 --> 01:16:18.286]  Also, calls coming up.
[01:16:18.846 --> 01:16:23.687]  Nobel Prize winning economist, Federal Reserve System is corrupt and undermining our country.
[01:16:23.927 --> 01:16:25.888]  That's Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel Prize winner.
[01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:35.183]  Continuing here, I've got all these other news articles admitting, here's Joseph Stiklitz again, saying it's corrupt, undermining our country.
[01:16:35.683 --> 01:16:38.304]  IMF-style austerity measures come to America.
[01:16:38.864 --> 01:16:41.365]  Everything that's been done in other countries now happening here.
[01:16:41.665 --> 01:16:51.429]  We're coming to this critical juncture where we're going into total bondage to private banks who are setting up their own government and getting the G20 together to sign on to it.
[01:16:52.009 --> 01:16:53.810]  Bob Chapman, continue where we cut you off.
[01:16:54.892 --> 01:17:06.114]  Well, I think that the Greek affair, we'll call it, was instigated and executed because they're going to take all these countries down.
[01:17:06.454 --> 01:17:07.295]  They're ready to do it.
[01:17:08.175 --> 01:17:15.056]  It'll happen sometime over the next couple of years, probably more so a year or more from now.
[01:17:15.956 --> 01:17:16.997]  But, you know, who knows?
[01:17:17.577 --> 01:17:19.777]  But that's what they're steaming for now.
[01:17:20.277 --> 01:17:23.938]  I was really surprised they pulled it that way and did it that way.
[01:17:26.053 --> 01:17:27.113]  I just didn't expect it.
[01:17:27.653 --> 01:17:35.557]  Because most people who look at these kinds of things in Europe, they do all about this.
[01:17:36.277 --> 01:17:39.819]  I mean, Greece and Italy's problems... Well, wait a minute.
[01:17:39.839 --> 01:17:42.520]  I mean, you're saying you're surprised you predicted all of this.
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:46.822]  I know, but I'm surprised that they went at it this way.
[01:17:48.222 --> 01:17:49.823]  Because it's been common knowledge.
[01:17:50.953 --> 01:17:54.514]  That all these countries were problematic.
[01:17:55.054 --> 01:18:08.219]  I thought they'd probably do something with the U.S., execute some sort of a move which would take the country down, and maybe they yet will to join the others, so to speak.
[01:18:08.739 --> 01:18:15.981]  But the culmination of the whole thing is that what they're about now is taking the whole world down.
[01:18:16.921 --> 01:18:18.682]  And I think that's not too far away.
[01:18:19.977 --> 01:18:24.657]  You know a year ago we talked about three years and now we're talking about two years.
[01:18:25.727 --> 01:18:28.228]  But it could be a little bit more expeditious than that.
[01:18:28.248 --> 01:18:51.199]  Well, what Van Rompuy Singh, head of the EU, what Ban Ki-moon, head of the UN, saying, what Gordon Brown, who really is the omnibudsman of this, he says in the next 16 months they're going to form their global banking constitution over all nations, and they said from Copenhagen they don't care if nations don't sign on, the executive branches will implement this, and they're just celebrating.
[01:18:53.308 --> 01:19:00.935]  Well, I don't know whether they'll be celebrating at that time because the people of the world, I think, are finally going to say, no, we've had enough of this.
[01:19:02.436 --> 01:19:11.084]  We are seeing riots in Indonesia, riots in California, or serious protests, riots in European countries like Greece.
[01:19:13.166 --> 01:19:17.630]  Why do the Greeks and the Indonesians get what's going on, but a lot of Americans don't?
[01:19:19.571 --> 01:19:23.134]  Well, I don't think it's gotten difficult enough yet.
[01:19:23.394 --> 01:19:27.897]  And of course, not everybody listens to talk radio or goes on the Internet.
[01:19:28.578 --> 01:19:34.562]  And so you have half or more of the population that never, never comes in contact with this sort of thing.
[01:19:35.403 --> 01:19:36.664]  And so that's why they don't know.
[01:19:36.724 --> 01:19:44.630]  And Europeans and others in other countries are far more curious than Americans are.
[01:19:45.370 --> 01:19:47.272]  Americans tend to be very provincial.
[01:19:48.406 --> 01:19:50.648]  Most Americans never leave the United States.
[01:19:50.728 --> 01:19:56.192]  In fact, most don't go more than 500 miles from where they were born.
[01:19:59.694 --> 01:20:06.159]  And they think their government loves them and cares about them, but more and more of the polls show they're waking up that that's not the case.
[01:20:06.199 --> 01:20:10.702]  They think good guys run America when America's been captured by private banks.
[01:20:13.544 --> 01:20:14.905]  Among other things, but the
[01:20:16.607 --> 01:20:26.531]  The strata that's controlled by the Illuminists, and that includes many other things, but the bank is certainly the nexus of the whole thing.
[01:20:26.571 --> 01:20:27.931]  There's no question about that.
[01:20:28.751 --> 01:20:41.396]  You know, money makes it all work, and banking is now Wall Street as well, because many of them have become banks in order to get TARP funds, so they didn't go totally bankrupt at that time.
[01:20:42.452 --> 01:20:46.673]  And so I think it's a periphery of things.
[01:20:47.014 --> 01:20:50.855]  You know, seven major insurance companies got TARP money.
[01:20:50.875 --> 01:20:51.915]  They haven't paid it back.
[01:20:52.735 --> 01:20:59.418]  And I noticed with this CHEL thing, they've had a record amount of money that's been requested before it's terminated.
[01:21:00.198 --> 01:21:03.159]  And once they terminate these programs and the stimulus runs out,
[01:21:05.397 --> 01:21:07.258]  Well, that's what's incredible.
[01:21:07.838 --> 01:21:14.159]  I saw an NBC headline where they just cut Medicare and Medicaid by 21% outside of any law.
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:20.141]  They're cutting all the supposed services while jacking up the taxes.
[01:21:20.201 --> 01:21:22.701]  I mean, they've got to know that's going to cause a revolt.
[01:21:24.062 --> 01:21:27.923]  Well, they also got to know that it's going to cause more unemployment, too.
[01:21:28.943 --> 01:21:32.784]  And so after the stimulus runs out, it's going to be everybody for himself.
[01:21:33.604 --> 01:21:38.088]  And next year will be horrendous, and all of these things will start coming to fore.
[01:21:38.868 --> 01:21:47.495]  And in instituting what they're doing, what you just described, and I'm describing, and... Hold on, let's talk about this key point when we come back.
[01:21:47.515 --> 01:21:49.116]  We're gonna get into a host of issues.
[01:21:50.518 --> 01:21:51.438]  We're on the march.
[01:21:51.919 --> 01:21:53.520]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:54.461 --> 01:21:57.143]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:00.086 --> 01:22:01.066]  What's your home worth?
[01:22:01.246 --> 01:22:03.167]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:22:03.367 --> 01:22:06.088]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[01:22:06.388 --> 01:22:13.910]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[01:22:14.110 --> 01:22:17.551]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.

[01:22:32.759 --> 01:22:33.259]  We're good to go.
[01:22:59.964 --> 01:23:02.425]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.
[01:23:02.725 --> 01:23:08.488]  Well, here's an unbelievable chance for you to jumpstart your food savings plan from efoodsdirect.com.

[01:23:23.378 --> 01:23:25.340]  That's buy three, get one free.
[01:23:25.541 --> 01:23:28.263]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[01:23:28.443 --> 01:23:36.011]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you in this buy three, get one free program.
[01:23:36.411 --> 01:23:39.293]  Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see.
[01:23:39.673 --> 01:23:40.514]  Another example?
[01:23:40.734 --> 01:23:43.776]  Buy nine months worth of food and get three months free.
[01:23:43.916 --> 01:23:49.059]  You've got to go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex for the food buy of a lifetime.
[01:23:49.079 --> 01:23:49.839]  Or call 800-409-5633.
[01:23:49.899 --> 01:23:50.940]  Go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex or 800-409-5633.
[01:23:59.889 --> 01:24:05.211]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:24:06.451 --> 01:24:11.213]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:24:11.593 --> 01:24:18.395]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:24:20.316 --> 01:24:22.517]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:24:24.397 --> 01:24:26.518]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:24:28.826 --> 01:24:32.708]  Put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:24:33.409 --> 01:24:36.550]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[01:24:37.251 --> 01:24:38.051]  Others don't.
[01:24:38.471 --> 01:24:40.372]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:24:40.632 --> 01:24:42.133]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:24:42.413 --> 01:24:44.975]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:24:45.295 --> 01:24:51.558]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:24:51.919 --> 01:24:54.120]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:56.661]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[01:24:56.981 --> 01:24:57.862]  Others don't.
[01:25:06.078 --> 01:25:06.699]  Watch me!
[01:25:07.942 --> 01:25:08.462]  Watch me!
[01:25:09.884 --> 01:25:12.225]  All right, Bob Chapman, the International Forecaster.
[01:25:12.245 --> 01:25:18.427]  I want to get into a bunch of news with you on other interlocking subjects here in a moment, but we got cut off by the break.
[01:25:19.207 --> 01:25:24.389]  I had brought up the point for listeners that just joined us that they know they're driving everyone into bankruptcy.
[01:25:24.429 --> 01:25:25.810]  They know they're destroying the economy.
[01:25:26.250 --> 01:25:28.751]  We have all the internal globalist documents, their public statements.
[01:25:28.771 --> 01:25:31.072]  They want to end consumerism.
[01:25:31.112 --> 01:25:32.732]  They use it to get us in debt.
[01:25:33.353 --> 01:25:35.493]  Now they want to lower our carbon footprint.
[01:25:35.934 --> 01:25:38.274]  They want to bankrupt us so we're dependent on government.
[01:25:38.314 --> 01:25:39.275]  This is economic
[01:25:40.566 --> 01:25:41.187]  Conquest.
[01:25:41.267 --> 01:25:42.187]  This is bondage.
[01:25:43.168 --> 01:25:47.232]  And you were agreeing with me and started to make a point as we ran into break.
[01:25:48.653 --> 01:25:48.933]  Right.
[01:25:49.013 --> 01:25:55.338]  And I think we're going to see inflation build up very quickly over the next perhaps 12 months.
[01:25:56.219 --> 01:26:03.385]  And after that, they'll probably pull the plug and they'll take all of these nations down together and the whole world will go with them.
[01:26:04.306 --> 01:26:06.087]  And that's where I think this is all headed.
[01:26:06.127 --> 01:26:06.688]  And that's why
[01:26:07.419 --> 01:26:14.744]  They triggered Greece as the governmental leader into the abyss, so to speak.
[01:26:15.205 --> 01:26:28.814]  And of course, if they continue to have higher unemployment and lower economic output, that will bring on deflation and cut off the inflation which is in process.
[01:26:28.834 --> 01:26:33.998]  So that will be their way of getting rid of the inflation which they've created.
[01:26:34.622 --> 01:26:51.767]  And we'll dive into a deflationary depression and we will, nation by nation, get in trouble and then they'll have their big meeting and they'll try to institute a world currency which won't work.
[01:26:51.967 --> 01:27:01.850]  But I do think that they will be able to put into place a world economic trading currency
[01:27:02.736 --> 01:27:08.573]  With G20 currencies in an index that would be weighted and I think that that's going to happen.
[01:27:09.229 --> 01:27:17.895]  We're going to get more into gold and the economy and ways to stop this, because if we expose these people and point out what they're doing, it's going to be that much harder.
[01:27:17.935 --> 01:27:19.996]  And people thought we couldn't beat Copenhagen, and we did.
[01:27:20.037 --> 01:27:21.958]  They thought we couldn't expose the flu fraud.
[01:27:22.318 --> 01:27:23.019]  We've done that.
[01:27:23.799 --> 01:27:25.180]  The media now admits it's a hoax.
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:27.141]  They didn't think we could beat healthcare.
[01:27:27.181 --> 01:27:28.763]  We've got a great chance of doing it now.
[01:27:28.823 --> 01:27:33.166]  We've gone from it being impossible, they told us, to it's very hard for them to get it passed.
[01:27:33.982 --> 01:27:42.369]  Again, the people are waking up, and I wanted to shift gears into some other subjects now here with you, Bob Chapman.
[01:27:42.849 --> 01:27:53.999]  Chief among them, as predicted, we now have all these big headlines, 9-11 truther shoots police at Pentagon.
[01:27:55.140 --> 01:28:01.587]  And within two hours of this event, they had his name, they had his supposed web comments on message boards.
[01:28:02.388 --> 01:28:05.712]  You've got, depending on the poll, 36 to 84 percent.
[01:28:06.032 --> 01:28:06.793]  It's wide-ranging.
[01:28:06.813 --> 01:28:08.635]  With the lowest polls, scientific, are 36.
[01:28:09.676 --> 01:28:11.999]  Our 9-11 truthers question the official story.
[01:28:12.699 --> 01:28:13.901]  So I guess any time
[01:28:15.484 --> 01:28:18.706]  A third of the country commits a crime, they'll say they were a 9-11 truther.
[01:28:19.126 --> 01:28:31.714]  I saw Beck and O'Reilly, and I also saw Matthews and others the last two months, you've been on the show and I've been warning of this, saying 9-11 truthers are going to kill Obama, attack bases, mark my words.
[01:28:32.695 --> 01:28:35.176]  And what an off-the-wall statement from peaceful 9-11 truth.
[01:28:36.792 --> 01:28:43.056]  You know, I've just read Operation Northwoods and other things where the government admits what they do, unless they were pre-programming people.
[01:28:43.356 --> 01:28:45.197]  Then I saw their whole agenda in trouble.
[01:28:45.237 --> 01:28:47.258]  Now they're tying it into birthers.
[01:28:47.358 --> 01:28:53.122]  Now they're saying birthers are terrorists, when that's more than half of registered Republicans who question Obama's birth certificate.
[01:28:53.602 --> 01:29:00.766]  And so you've got the patriots that recognize the enemy banks, the New World Order, and they're going to need to run false flags against us.
[01:29:00.866 --> 01:29:03.288]  And now more evidence of the stack thing was staged.
[01:29:03.948 --> 01:29:05.569]  We know the underwear bombing was staged.
[01:29:05.610 --> 01:29:09.873]  The feds even admitted they helped him get on a plane and protected him for part of national security operation.
[01:29:09.893 --> 01:29:10.714]  That's mainstream news.
[01:29:11.675 --> 01:29:13.056]  This thing stinks to high heaven.
[01:29:13.436 --> 01:29:19.521]  Beck's now out today just absolutely going crazy saying, see I told you, see I told you.
[01:29:19.541 --> 01:29:24.386]  And I'm trying to find my Times of London headline.
[01:29:24.426 --> 01:29:24.766]  Here it is.
[01:29:24.806 --> 01:29:27.748]  Give me a document cam shot for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:29:28.049 --> 01:29:31.272]  September 11th, conspiracy theorist opens fire at Pentagon.
[01:29:31.992 --> 01:29:35.453]  And within two hours of it, they had these headlines going out, Bob.
[01:29:35.893 --> 01:29:45.655]  And then we had the case of Jeremy Tallis, We Are Changer, out there protesting the police and firemen and medical workers dying from the dust at an event.
[01:29:46.115 --> 01:29:53.816]  Out of a dark doorway comes a man with a handicapped girl in a wheelchair screaming, don't attack my daughter, ramming it into him.
[01:29:54.277 --> 01:29:55.597]  The witnesses all saw this.
[01:29:57.051 --> 01:30:00.012]  The news put out that 9-11 truther attacks handicapped girl.
[01:30:00.032 --> 01:30:01.092]  Look at how staged that is.
[01:30:01.632 --> 01:30:02.973]  And then they went to court and fought it.
[01:30:03.033 --> 01:30:04.633]  And I told Talas, don't plea bargain.
[01:30:04.693 --> 01:30:05.534]  You have the witnesses.
[01:30:05.874 --> 01:30:07.494]  And the Secret Service wouldn't lie.
[01:30:07.634 --> 01:30:09.075]  NYPD did and said no.
[01:30:09.615 --> 01:30:10.415]  He was attacked.
[01:30:10.835 --> 01:30:11.756]  They attacked him.
[01:30:12.176 --> 01:30:13.496]  And so they lost in court.
[01:30:13.536 --> 01:30:14.817]  The New York Post had to retract.
[01:30:15.137 --> 01:30:18.838]  The point is, they're running serious psyops.
[01:30:19.298 --> 01:30:23.719]  The Southern Poverty Law Center says they believe the Patriots will launch terror attacks in mid-April.
[01:30:24.099 --> 01:30:38.243]  I've been saying that for months because I know there's five TV productions from MSNBC to HBO to CNN and Fox and CNBC demonizing yours truly, Alex Jones, and others in production to air in the middle of April.
[01:30:38.823 --> 01:30:42.584]  So they'll have all these shows demonizing us right when they stage the event.
[01:30:42.884 --> 01:30:47.765]  Now, by exposing it may not happen, but I just gave people a briefing on what's going on.
[01:30:48.745 --> 01:30:50.966]  But, Bob, I mean, this stinks to high heaven.
[01:30:52.246 --> 01:31:07.050]  Well, it's just proof positive that, as you pointed out, that they are running these PSYOPs and they are using in-depth psychological warfare and propaganda
[01:31:07.928 --> 01:31:11.890]  And you can even see the timing of it because you've had access to it.
[01:31:12.791 --> 01:31:21.516]  And, you know, goodness knows it goes on every day in very subtle and very professional fashion on television.
[01:31:22.316 --> 01:31:31.601]  And these poor souls who watch all these programs in the news, they don't know which end is up.
[01:31:32.382 --> 01:31:34.643]  And that makes up probably half the population.
[01:31:35.123 --> 01:31:36.424]  And so it's up to us.
[01:31:37.105 --> 01:31:42.127]  To be able to get the word to them and say, hey, stop, you know, something's wrong.
[01:31:42.167 --> 01:31:43.567]  Listen to what we've got to say.
[01:31:44.427 --> 01:31:48.509]  And and maybe you'll find out what is really going on.
[01:31:49.149 --> 01:31:54.831]  And one of the problems there is that a lot of these people don't go on the Internet.
[01:31:55.851 --> 01:32:01.013]  So that eliminates that source completely or almost completely.
[01:32:01.693 --> 01:32:04.854]  And so we got to get them on the airwaves and we're doing it.
[01:32:05.846 --> 01:32:08.648]  The question is, are we doing it fast enough?
[01:32:09.569 --> 01:32:29.382]  Yes, the urgency for all the listeners to get the articles Paul Watson and Kurt Nemo have written about this, the urgency of getting the videos in the last two months when I laid all this out, out to everyone you know, saying, look, he predicted this and others did, the urgency of understanding this paradigm because, again, in layman's terms for new listeners, let me explain.
[01:32:30.823 --> 01:32:32.605]  I know of five productions
[01:32:33.581 --> 01:32:45.287]  For cable news and TV, and I noticed when I was contacted by several of their productions and learned about the other productions, it's all about how the Tea Parties are evil, 9-11 Truth is evil, we're going to stage terror.
[01:32:45.727 --> 01:32:54.372]  I see a talking point on the news with no evidence of this happening, then it starts manifesting in the lead up to these shows that are about to air.
[01:32:55.012 --> 01:32:56.813]  I mean, put two and two together, folks.
[01:32:56.833 --> 01:32:58.354]  They don't just produce a bunch of shows.
[01:32:59.957 --> 01:33:01.238]  Because it takes months to do this.
[01:33:02.038 --> 01:33:02.919]  It's just like the U.S.
[01:33:02.959 --> 01:33:05.321]  military massing around Afghanistan right before 9-11.
[01:33:05.961 --> 01:33:09.503]  And Bush signing the launch order to attack them in the next month on September 10th.
[01:33:10.224 --> 01:33:12.785]  I mean, this is basic intelligence.
[01:33:13.546 --> 01:33:16.508]  And their whole agenda is imploding.
[01:33:16.548 --> 01:33:19.810]  The last time that happened in 1995, they bombed Oklahoma City, Bob.
[01:33:21.731 --> 01:33:22.192]  That's right.
[01:33:23.993 --> 01:33:24.573]  That's right.
[01:33:25.093 --> 01:33:28.776]  You know, some of these things are so similar.
[01:33:30.092 --> 01:33:34.953]  And, you know, you scratch your head and you say, where are they going to do it next?
[01:33:36.273 --> 01:33:43.074]  And some of the underlying factors are there and have been there to do these kind of things for a long time.
[01:33:43.174 --> 01:33:44.835]  So there's plenty of fertile ground.
[01:33:45.355 --> 01:33:55.117]  I mean, just like I pointed out with Greece, I mean, everybody in Europe knew for the last dozen years that they and Italy fudged their books in order to get accepted into the Eurozone.
[01:33:55.137 --> 01:33:57.117]  And Goldman Sachs helped them engineer it.
[01:33:58.345 --> 01:33:58.826]  That's right.
[01:33:59.066 --> 01:34:08.562]  And in part, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, particularly in Italy, they're getting some terrible trouble there and there's still court cases going on.
[01:34:09.604 --> 01:34:11.347]  Some of the shenanigans that they've pulled.
[01:34:11.633 --> 01:34:13.434]  Well, Bob, it's a very simple equation.
[01:34:14.535 --> 01:34:16.976]  The bankers are all registering record profits.
[01:34:17.036 --> 01:34:18.617]  The rest of the economy is going under.
[01:34:18.917 --> 01:34:20.578]  The nation states are going bankrupt.
[01:34:20.838 --> 01:34:33.325]  The bankers are celebrating the birth of a world government they're going to run through nothing but complete fraud that they took over the planet by getting us to accept their control of the issuance of currency and credit.
[01:34:34.466 --> 01:34:35.807]  They're getting rich and powerful.
[01:34:36.607 --> 01:34:37.988]  Everybody else is imploding.
[01:34:38.608 --> 01:34:39.549]  They're above the law.
[01:34:40.788 --> 01:34:42.188]  They're above the tax laws.
[01:34:42.248 --> 01:34:43.249]  I mean, it's incredible!
[01:34:45.650 --> 01:34:47.770]  Well, they're certainly above the law, that's for sure.
[01:34:49.251 --> 01:34:52.512]  And more and more people are becoming aware of that every day.
[01:34:53.632 --> 01:34:56.233]  Bob, I want to hit another subject and then get into gold with you.
[01:34:56.593 --> 01:34:58.073]  Here's The Hill newspaper.
[01:34:58.433 --> 01:35:03.275]  Microsoft exec pitches internet usage tax to pay for cyber security.
[01:35:04.966 --> 01:35:07.048]  Okay, so there they are with the internet tax.
[01:35:07.068 --> 01:35:09.371]  They also want you to get a web licensing to get online.
[01:35:09.411 --> 01:35:10.753]  I told you they're announcing all this.
[01:35:11.413 --> 01:35:13.836]  Here is Wired Magazine.
[01:35:13.896 --> 01:35:15.438]  This is not Alex Jones saying this.
[01:35:15.959 --> 01:35:19.823]  Cyber war hype intended to destroy the open internet.
[01:35:20.904 --> 01:35:22.026]  And they go on to report
[01:35:23.035 --> 01:35:25.557]  That this is the end of freedom on the internet.
[01:35:25.957 --> 01:35:36.246]  As they're about, and this is the big, another big symbol, another indicator they're about to stage terror and bring in police state, because when they finally do that, they're going to start shutting many areas of the web off selectively.
[01:35:37.147 --> 01:35:39.649]  Fury as EU approves GMO potato.
[01:35:39.669 --> 01:35:40.369]  That's another article.
[01:35:40.650 --> 01:35:43.272]  White House cyber czar says there is no cyber war, though.
[01:35:44.293 --> 01:35:45.434]  And then I've got another one here.
[01:35:46.094 --> 01:35:48.096]  I mean, Bob.
[01:35:50.445 --> 01:35:54.787]  I'm sure you heard about the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling two weeks ago, there's no Fourth Amendment?
[01:35:56.468 --> 01:35:57.569]  Right, I heard about it.
[01:35:59.550 --> 01:36:09.794]  And you know, you're talking about this cyber thing, I've got research here, Milan Court sentences Google officials to prison for a whistleblowing video.
[01:36:10.715 --> 01:36:12.856]  And then we've got another one here from
[01:36:14.051 --> 01:36:20.254]  The anti-counterfeiting trade agreement so that they can spy on you.
[01:36:21.074 --> 01:36:31.898]  And we got another one here, broadband tax in Great Britain that they want to institute, which is similar to what you just read from The Hill.
[01:36:32.819 --> 01:36:41.202]  The French net is filtering, has a filtering plan, and it's moving forward in the Assembly in France.
[01:36:42.356 --> 01:36:43.117]  I don't
[01:36:56.118 --> 01:37:00.341]  Research out, because it comes up fairly often on the programs that I'm on.
[01:37:00.441 --> 01:37:00.941]  Exactly.
[01:37:01.001 --> 01:37:01.622]  Here's another one.
[01:37:01.682 --> 01:37:02.802]  Infowars.net.
[01:37:03.183 --> 01:37:06.485]  Former Director of National Intelligence calls for re-engineering of the internet.
[01:37:06.725 --> 01:37:10.227]  They're already seizing the whole system, putting their control grid in.
[01:37:10.247 --> 01:37:17.052]  I mean, I want listeners to know, when Bob and I get up here on the show, and others, we're not just making this up to be shocking.
[01:37:17.492 --> 01:37:23.234]  I've been telling you for years, under Internet 2, they were going to do exactly what they're doing now, because I was reading their own white papers!
[01:37:23.594 --> 01:37:25.735]  This is not rocket science, okay?
[01:37:26.236 --> 01:37:46.704]  Bob, I want to bring Ted Anderson up and come back in the next segment and take a few calls for you, but I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up because he's got a deal, and he's the owner of the Genesis Network, he also owns Minus Resources, where he's giving your 159-year membership in hard copy or twice a week in email, 45 pages, the most invaluable newsletter I know of.
[01:37:47.304 --> 01:37:51.867]  Folks, no other guest has this much key info, plus a lot of its articles we write.
[01:37:52.047 --> 01:37:53.748]  You will notice Bob knows what the good stuff is.
[01:37:55.029 --> 01:37:57.010]  It's over 45 pages, sometimes even longer.
[01:37:57.330 --> 01:37:58.131]  The point is...
[01:37:59.244 --> 01:38:05.327]  A free year membership, digital or hard copy, from Bob Chapman when you buy one franc.
[01:38:05.828 --> 01:38:10.190]  And this comes out to $500 an ounce gold with this deal.
[01:38:10.510 --> 01:38:13.592]  Ted, throw out quickly, because I didn't even tell Bob we were going to do this.
[01:38:13.932 --> 01:38:15.013]  I want to see what he's going to say.
[01:38:15.493 --> 01:38:19.815]  Throw out your gold and silver deals real fast, and then we're going to ask Bob how good a deal those are.
[01:38:19.995 --> 01:38:24.478]  Because I happen to know you can't find gold deals and silver deals anywhere near this anywhere.
[01:38:24.818 --> 01:38:26.659]  You know, some places do fake bait and switches.
[01:38:26.979 --> 01:38:28.040]  This is real, folks.
[01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:28.560]  Ted Anderson.
[01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:30.904]  Yeah, well the frank is currently right now $261.61.
[01:38:30.944 --> 01:38:40.420]  And if you buy just the one coin, you're going to be able to get a full year subscription to the International Forecaster, just like Alex described.
[01:38:41.007 --> 01:38:45.851]  Now, if you take the discount of that $159 off of there, it comes out to be about $520 gold.
[01:38:45.871 --> 01:38:52.356]  And you have to turn back the clock more than 10 years to be able to buy gold at that price.
[01:38:52.937 --> 01:38:56.559]  We also have the Montana Silver Rounds there at $18.73.
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:58.441]  That's also another great buy.
[01:38:58.461 --> 01:39:01.924]  I know I've seen online those have gone over $20 now.
[01:39:02.064 --> 01:39:04.146]  And then the $20 Liberty, Alex, at $1,363 for a $20 Liberty, which is a 100-year-old coin.
[01:39:10.961 --> 01:39:11.581]  You know, U.S.
[01:39:11.661 --> 01:39:17.706]  Eagles are over $1,200 right now, and that coin is just absolutely a steal.
[01:39:18.066 --> 01:39:19.567]  What do you got on Sovereigns, Ted?
[01:39:19.787 --> 01:39:24.071]  Well, Sovereigns right now are at $318, also another really good buy.
[01:39:24.451 --> 01:39:36.220]  But I can tell you right now, I can't make a sweeter deal than for you to have the International Forecaster, and after calculating the discount, you're buying gold at $520 an ounce.
[01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:38.682]  Bob Chapman, how good is that deal Ted just offered?
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:41.101]  It is fantastic.
[01:39:41.221 --> 01:39:42.822]  It does not get any better.
[01:39:44.342 --> 01:39:45.663]  Let me just add this, too.
[01:39:46.243 --> 01:39:47.944]  Folks, I really have storable food.
[01:39:48.044 --> 01:39:49.145]  I really have firearms.
[01:39:49.225 --> 01:39:58.990]  Because I read the banks a decade ago saying they're going to get everybody in debt, implode the world economy, bring in a world government they run with planned austerity.
[01:39:59.450 --> 01:40:08.675]  Now, ten years later, I see it in the news with the IMF, the World Bank, the Federal Reserve, the Harvard Business School head all saying a new way of life is here.
[01:40:09.335 --> 01:40:11.957]  You're all going to be slaves now, but it's good for the earth.
[01:40:12.197 --> 01:40:15.140]  Headline, bad economy, good for carbon footprint.
[01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:23.346]  I have a family to take care of, so I've got gold, I've got silver, I've got food, and I bought my gold and silver from Ted Anderson.
[01:40:23.386 --> 01:40:26.409]  And let me tell you, when gold, when I bought for 260 bucks an ounce 10 years ago,
[01:40:28.030 --> 01:40:29.551]  When it went up to $500, I didn't sell it.
[01:40:29.791 --> 01:40:31.331]  When it went to $1,000, I didn't sell it.
[01:40:31.571 --> 01:40:34.112]  When it went up to $1,230, I didn't sell it.
[01:40:34.272 --> 01:40:36.813]  When it went back down to $950, I didn't sell it.
[01:40:36.993 --> 01:40:39.934]  When it ran back up to $1,130, I didn't sell it.
[01:40:40.255 --> 01:40:49.918]  I'm not selling it, because I know they're in a concerted effort to devalue currencies worldwide, and I will not be dependent on this stinking criminal government!
[01:40:50.218 --> 01:40:51.859]  And that's the reason to get gold and silver.
[01:40:52.119 --> 01:40:55.500]  A lot of you've got it for an investment you've done better than any other investment out there.
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:57.701]  It's the best performing in the last decade period.
[01:40:57.921 --> 01:40:58.661]  Everybody knows that.
[01:40:58.681 --> 01:40:59.241]  That's admitted.
[01:40:59.741 --> 01:41:01.582]  The issue is that's not why I even have it.
[01:41:01.862 --> 01:41:03.943]  I have it because it protects me.
[01:41:04.423 --> 01:41:06.143]  Bob Chapman, how important is that point?
[01:41:07.084 --> 01:41:13.986]  It is the most important thing that you can do after you put in your defensive position, which is food, filter, and weapons.
[01:41:16.087 --> 01:41:16.727]  Absolutely.
[01:41:16.767 --> 01:41:18.488]  Here's the number for all those different offers.
[01:41:18.568 --> 01:41:20.189]  Brokers will be there throughout the weekend.
[01:41:20.549 --> 01:41:23.731]  If they're out to lunch or something, there's usually 15 of them up there on the weekend.
[01:41:23.991 --> 01:41:31.455]  Leave your name and number, they'll call you right back, and you'll be able to get this deal because gold's still going up, and Ted's giving you lower prices because he bought it when it was lower.
[01:41:31.736 --> 01:41:33.296]  How long can you hold these deals, Ted?
[01:41:33.336 --> 01:41:36.378]  Well, I'm going to hold it right through Sunday, and then we'll see what Monday holds.
[01:41:36.458 --> 01:41:38.099]  But yeah, I can do it right through Sunday.
[01:41:38.139 --> 01:41:45.083]  So if you're looking for something at this particular time, this would be the time to get locked in, especially on that Frankenforecaster.
[01:41:46.044 --> 01:41:52.684]  Those two things tied together like that, it's going to give you the information that you need to have in order to know what's going on in this economy.
[01:41:53.177 --> 01:41:59.919]  In addition to this, you're going to have a piece of gold that you could trade not just here in the United States, but across the world.
[01:41:59.939 --> 01:42:01.160]  800-686-2237.
[01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:02.540]  Here's that number slowly.
[01:42:02.921 --> 01:42:03.901]  People say you say it too fast.
[01:42:03.961 --> 01:42:04.501]  Okay, here it is.
[01:42:04.521 --> 01:42:04.661]  800-686-2237.
[01:42:04.681 --> 01:42:04.841]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:42:05.241 --> 01:42:09.503]  And Ted, a lot of times doesn't offer these special deals online.
[01:42:18.306 --> 01:42:21.189]  He is offering it as a special deal online.
[01:42:21.209 --> 01:42:30.358]  You've got to go to InfoWars.com, go into the news, featured news archive from yesterday, and we put an article up about it, about gold exploding in value as currencies decline.
[01:42:31.098 --> 01:42:32.780]  But you can also call toll-free 800-686-2237.
[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:38.045]  Just tell them it's the Alex Jones Special, or you'll be paying more.
[01:42:38.065 --> 01:42:38.986]  That's still a good deal.
[01:42:39.206 --> 01:42:39.907]  800-686-2237.
[01:42:42.690 --> 01:42:43.891]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:42:44.151 --> 01:42:45.673]  The bankers are all hoarding gold.
[01:42:45.713 --> 01:42:46.874]  They tell you not to own it.
[01:42:47.194 --> 01:42:47.855]  Give me a break.
[01:42:48.095 --> 01:42:48.796]  Thank you, Ted Anderson.
[01:42:48.816 --> 01:42:50.978]  We're going to come back with a final segment for Bob Chapman.
[01:42:51.279 --> 01:42:52.720]  Jam a few phone calls in.
[01:42:53.661 --> 01:42:57.906]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to blow the horn and warn the people about the enemy.
[01:42:59.778 --> 01:43:02.961]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:43:03.342 --> 01:43:05.163]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:43:05.624 --> 01:43:06.044]  Don't!
[01:43:06.505 --> 01:43:09.528]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:43:09.928 --> 01:43:17.055]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[01:43:17.035 --> 01:43:18.717]  's number one debt secret.
[01:43:19.037 --> 01:43:22.701]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[01:43:23.081 --> 01:43:25.804]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[01:43:25.824 --> 01:43:33.270]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:43:33.611 --> 01:43:34.612]  Herb K was right.
[01:43:34.792 --> 01:43:37.875]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:43:37.975 --> 01:43:38.976]  What have you got to lose?
[01:43:39.336 --> 01:43:42.459]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[01:43:43.019 --> 01:43:46.100]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now!
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:46.720]  Call 888-352-7726.

[01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:47.560]  888-352-7726.
[01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:50.781]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:43:51.401 --> 01:43:53.562]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:43:53.582 --> 01:43:55.842]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:44:10.547 --> 01:44:13.028]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:44:13.809 --> 01:44:19.251]  Tremendous influence on our president and Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[01:44:19.432 --> 01:44:24.454]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:44:24.614 --> 01:44:34.599]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:44:34.719 --> 01:44:36.821]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:44:37.061 --> 01:44:38.403]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:44:38.643 --> 01:44:40.925]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:44:41.105 --> 01:44:42.947]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:44:43.247 --> 01:44:48.032]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:44:48.392 --> 01:44:57.501]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:44:59.534 --> 01:45:00.395]  Spring is here.
[01:45:00.655 --> 01:45:01.436]  Growing season.
[01:45:01.616 --> 01:45:03.597]  The economy is not getting any better.
[01:45:03.817 --> 01:45:05.218]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[01:45:05.519 --> 01:45:06.199]  Think about it.
[01:45:06.499 --> 01:45:10.362]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[01:45:10.583 --> 01:45:14.085]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[01:45:14.345 --> 01:45:15.967]  The country is running out of food.
[01:45:16.227 --> 01:45:18.809]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[01:45:19.069 --> 01:45:29.257]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you
[01:45:29.517 --> 01:45:30.137]  And the best part?

[01:46:02.813 --> 01:46:04.574]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:46:04.594 --> 01:46:05.055]  to 3 p.m.
[01:46:05.095 --> 01:46:05.435]  Central.
[01:46:05.455 --> 01:46:06.236]  We're here live.
[01:46:06.256 --> 01:46:08.717]  I don't have it in front of me, so the guys are printing it again.
[01:46:09.358 --> 01:46:12.400]  XM, Saturday evenings, re-airs us for three hours.
[01:46:13.161 --> 01:46:16.743]  Starting next week, we are... Yeah, go ahead and bring it in to me.
[01:46:17.003 --> 01:46:17.284]  Thank you.
[01:46:17.524 --> 01:46:19.986]  We're going to be on five days a week on XM.
[01:46:20.026 --> 01:46:22.467]  They had such a good response, but only one hour a night.
[01:46:22.507 --> 01:46:24.989]  They may expand it as they get more room.
[01:46:26.210 --> 01:46:26.510]  XM 158.
[01:46:26.650 --> 01:46:30.332]  We're on, what is it, XM 156 right now on Saturdays.
[01:46:30.392 --> 01:46:37.396]  It's going to switch to XM 158 and that is going to be 8 to 9 p.m.
[01:46:37.556 --> 01:46:43.359]  Central Standard Time and the show re-aired on Saturday afternoons.
[01:46:43.419 --> 01:46:47.381]  It's going to switch from the channel it's on now to 158 as well.
[01:46:47.961 --> 01:46:49.442]  So exciting and we got
[01:46:50.382 --> 01:47:19.131]  Six new affiliates in the last week and a half on AM and FM as well, like KEYS 1440 AM, Corpus Christi, KLRG 880 AM, Little Rock, Arkansas, 50,000 watts, WIFL 104.3 FM in Florida, in Gainesville and North Tampa, KMLS 101.9 FM, Carlsbad, New Mexico, WTAN 1340 AM, Tampa, Florida, and some other ones.
[01:47:19.611 --> 01:47:20.732]  So, very, very exciting.
[01:47:20.752 --> 01:47:21.993]  I want to thank all those affiliates.
[01:47:22.333 --> 01:47:26.937]  Bob, that really is the good news, though, because I know your newsletter has got like a rocket tied to it.
[01:47:26.957 --> 01:47:29.018]  My radio shows, my websites, my films.
[01:47:30.279 --> 01:47:35.423]  I've got Newsweek, Time Magazine, Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL attacking me.
[01:47:35.784 --> 01:47:37.145]  Newspapers attack me every day.
[01:47:37.445 --> 01:47:38.406]  Is that not a good sign?
[01:47:39.466 --> 01:47:40.287]  It certainly is.
[01:47:40.807 --> 01:47:42.929]  And they don't attack me because they can't find me.
[01:47:44.010 --> 01:47:45.311]  Oh, they attack you, somebody.
[01:47:47.077 --> 01:47:52.262]  Incidentally, you know, Ted was talking about gold and you as well and its future.
[01:47:52.982 --> 01:47:54.924]  And, you know, I had to point something up here.
[01:47:55.825 --> 01:48:04.732]  And it's the a lot of people want to get into other currencies as opposed to or with being in gold.
[01:48:05.693 --> 01:48:07.555]  And I want to point something out here.
[01:48:08.736 --> 01:48:12.679]  And I'm going to give you in three segments, 2008, 2009 and year to date.
[01:48:15.339 --> 01:48:15.739]  The U.S.
[01:48:15.819 --> 01:48:22.584]  dollar in gold terms, gold went up 1% against the dollar in 2008.
[01:48:23.344 --> 01:48:24.765]  In 2009, it went up 24.7%.
[01:48:26.086 --> 01:48:28.688]  And so far this year, it's up 24.3%.
[01:48:30.249 --> 01:48:38.974]  And the figures in the yen, and in the euro, and in the Swiss franc, and in the renminbi, are similar.
[01:48:39.615 --> 01:48:42.877]  I won't go into all the numbers, but I want to let people know
[01:48:43.695 --> 01:48:45.356]  That no currency is going to save you.
[01:48:46.156 --> 01:48:47.616]  You don't want to be in a currency.
[01:48:48.056 --> 01:48:50.437]  You only want to be in gold and silver.
[01:48:50.837 --> 01:48:51.537]  And that's the end of it.
[01:48:52.678 --> 01:49:04.981]  Well, Bob, we saw record prices for gold this week in Europe, and it went up some in the U.S., but not as much, and the banks admit they are devaluing the currencies in a coordinated fashion.
[01:49:05.041 --> 01:49:05.761]  Why do they do that?
[01:49:07.302 --> 01:49:08.122]  Well, I think
[01:49:08.652 --> 01:49:14.595]  The main reason is that they know gold is going to take off, and they're trying to soften the blow.
[01:49:14.675 --> 01:49:21.959]  Plus, there's special problems in Europe right now pertaining to the euro and other currencies.
[01:49:22.879 --> 01:49:29.022]  The Danish krona and the Swedish krona are having very bad problems.
[01:49:29.642 --> 01:49:36.606]  And of course, the British pound is outside of the eurozone, and they're having monstrous problems.
[01:49:37.893 --> 01:49:41.717]  In terms of England being the next Greece.
[01:49:42.218 --> 01:49:57.173]  And so, this shows you the coordinated effort, not only to devalue the value of these different currencies versus gold, but the pending problem of bankruptcy.
[01:49:57.654 --> 01:49:59.456]  They're evolving into it.
[01:50:00.293 --> 01:50:02.536]  And that's why they started this whole thing in the first place.
[01:50:02.796 --> 01:50:05.499]  They could have done this 10 years ago, but they weren't ready.
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:09.945]  Now they're ready, or they're being forced to, one or the other, and they're going ahead with it.
[01:50:11.570 --> 01:50:21.555]  And they think their police state control grid over Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, the United States, and Asia, and Latin America is going to be able to keep them in control.
[01:50:21.595 --> 01:50:27.278]  They think we're like Argentina or Nigeria where the people aren't armed and they got away with this.
[01:50:27.358 --> 01:50:29.159]  I don't see them being successful.
[01:50:29.479 --> 01:50:31.040]  Bob, stay with us just a few more minutes.
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:35.843]  I want to talk about how you see this unfolding, what's going to happen when they try to drop the hammer.
[01:50:36.143 --> 01:50:38.144]  Then we got Gerald Solente coming up.
[01:50:40.082 --> 01:50:45.030]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[01:50:45.712 --> 01:50:48.937]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:50:50.774 --> 01:50:54.438]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:50:54.778 --> 01:50:57.801]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:50:58.021 --> 01:51:02.805]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:51:02.825 --> 01:51:09.071]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:51:09.232 --> 01:51:11.474]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:51:11.974 --> 01:51:13.395]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:51:13.435 --> 01:51:14.115]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:51:14.135 --> 01:51:16.257]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:51:30.905 --> 01:51:32.746]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:51:33.026 --> 01:51:37.849]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:51:38.170 --> 01:51:48.096]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:51:52.679 --> 01:51:54.600]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:51:55.080 --> 01:51:57.862]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:52:07.628 --> 01:52:22.493]  Talking to Gerald Cilente, Webster Tarpley, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Bob Chapman, Max Keiser, we have the analyst and guest on who've been right over and over and over again, I'd say 95% of the time.
[01:52:23.033 --> 01:52:30.996]  And I've asked Bob and others, well, why do most of the analysts on TV, and they've had articles about this, get most of their predictions wrong?
[01:52:31.836 --> 01:52:34.117]  And Bob and others have said, well, it's not that they're even stupid.
[01:52:34.137 --> 01:52:34.897]  They're lying.
[01:52:34.957 --> 01:52:36.758]  They're suckering the public.
[01:52:37.158 --> 01:52:38.098]  They could be accurate.
[01:52:38.138 --> 01:52:39.059]  They know what's going on.
[01:52:39.099 --> 01:52:46.402]  It's like a few months ago, George Soros was being interviewed for TV and he said, well, of course I know where the dollar and currencies are going, but I'm not going to tell you.
[01:52:46.922 --> 01:52:47.762]  And they do know.
[01:52:48.202 --> 01:52:50.883]  And now it turns out he's behind a lot of what's happening in Greece.
[01:52:51.383 --> 01:52:52.524]  Now they're setting it up here.
[01:52:53.985 --> 01:52:58.506]  For the banker bailout, they engage in financial terrorism to drive down the currencies.
[01:52:58.826 --> 01:53:00.727]  Gerald Cilente joining us via video.
[01:53:00.787 --> 01:53:02.847]  Skype from New York.
[01:53:03.408 --> 01:53:05.668]  Top Trends Forecaster will be with us in just a moment.
[01:53:06.168 --> 01:53:11.470]  But finishing up on that point, Bob Chapman, of the loss of credibility of the mainstream media.
[01:53:12.510 --> 01:53:21.456]  To have them running around saying there's no new world order, the banks didn't steal any money, everything's fine, and then separately on their own channels admitting world government is here.
[01:53:21.476 --> 01:53:30.882]  I mean, when I talk about mainstream media losing all confidence that the public has in them, they almost have a negative deficit now.
[01:53:32.323 --> 01:53:33.004]  Well, that's right.
[01:53:33.264 --> 01:53:36.546]  And, you know, if they don't do what they're told, they don't keep their job.
[01:53:37.507 --> 01:53:41.770]  And if they don't want to do what, like CNBC,
[01:53:43.291 --> 01:53:45.392]  If you don't do what they tell you to do, you're out.
[01:53:46.312 --> 01:53:48.372]  And we just saw that with Dylan Rattigan.
[01:53:49.172 --> 01:53:52.553]  And now he's on MSNBC and he's doing a lot of exposure.
[01:53:53.433 --> 01:53:56.374]  Some of the same things that we're doing, and I think that's terrific.
[01:53:57.114 --> 01:54:00.835]  But, generally speaking, you can't tell the truth.
[01:54:00.875 --> 01:54:01.715]  They won't allow you to.
[01:54:01.995 --> 01:54:04.555]  And it's not only in the media, it's everywhere.
[01:54:04.775 --> 01:54:06.976]  Look at the economists and the analysts for years.
[01:54:07.656 --> 01:54:10.157]  I mean, why are they wrong two-thirds of the time?
[01:54:10.557 --> 01:54:12.397]  Some of the most brilliant people in the world.
[01:54:13.018 --> 01:54:16.601]  Only because they can't tell the truth because if they do, they lose their job.
[01:54:25.834 --> 01:54:32.698]  They were just giggling and laughing, the bankers are taking over, record profits, ha ha ha, the world collapsing is going to be good for us.
[01:54:32.718 --> 01:54:43.285]  I mean, you talk about Marie Antoinette, as the people are starving outside the Bastille, and they say that they're starving, they need bread, and she said, let them eat cake.
[01:54:43.905 --> 01:54:48.268]  Now, it's been reported she didn't really say that, but our modern bankers really are saying that.
[01:54:49.829 --> 01:54:54.772]  And they should be reminded over and over and over again, in a country of five million people,
[01:54:55.225 --> 01:54:59.106]  In the late 1700s, 300,000 of them lost their heads.
[01:55:02.807 --> 01:55:03.468]  Absolutely.
[01:55:03.608 --> 01:55:10.190]  All the scum that served this system is in a lot of trouble, and none of their police state or armored vehicles are going to save them.
[01:55:10.890 --> 01:55:13.551]  Bob Chapman, thank you so much for spending time with us today.
[01:55:14.711 --> 01:55:17.632]  My pleasure, and I'll see you a little earlier next week.
[01:55:18.123 --> 01:55:24.867]  All right, take care, absolutely, because you're coming on before Jesse Ventura next Friday, so Bob won't be with us in his normal third hour.
[01:55:25.187 --> 01:55:26.768]  He'll be with us in the second hour next week.
[01:55:27.028 --> 01:55:32.452]  We've got Max Keiser next week, some congressmen we're getting lined up, a lot of really informative guests next week.
[01:55:34.645 --> 01:55:36.646]  I tell you, I'm really excited about this next guest.
[01:55:36.706 --> 01:55:48.891]  Not only is he an eyewitness to the Chilean earthquake, and we're glad he got out of it alive, he is the top trends forecaster and three, four years ago predicted exactly what's happening today.
[01:55:48.931 --> 01:55:54.354]  And he got made fun of on some of the national TV stations when he said a lot of this, but they shouldn't have been laughing because
[01:55:55.094 --> 01:55:56.915]  I've been aware of his work for more than a decade.
[01:55:57.015 --> 01:56:04.639]  Unfortunately, almost all of it comes true because he's trends forecasting Gerald Cilente for the balance of the hour after this quick break.
[01:56:04.679 --> 01:56:06.159]  And we'll attempt to get to your calls.
[01:56:06.219 --> 01:56:13.323]  Doug, Toshia, Caleb, John, Anti-Nazi, and others that are calling in.
[01:56:13.643 --> 01:56:16.244]  Toll-free number to join us 1-800-259-9231.
[01:56:16.284 --> 01:56:18.325]  And I'll go to your calls.
[01:56:18.385 --> 01:56:19.326]  Since you're holding from earlier,
[01:56:20.206 --> 01:56:24.109]  Try to ask your question in the form of a trends forecast, because Gerald's a really smart guy.
[01:56:24.129 --> 01:56:25.130]  He can talk about any subject.
[01:56:25.370 --> 01:56:29.894]  He's one of the few guests that we can go to callers from a previous hour on, because he'll be able to comment on it.
[01:56:30.194 --> 01:56:32.396]  Wide range, general knowledge of a lot of things.
[01:56:32.897 --> 01:56:36.800]  A generalist rather than a specialist, and that's what I tend to believe I am.
[01:56:37.841 --> 01:56:46.428]  And so we'll talk to this gentleman on the other side of this break, and we'll also give you his website and tell you how to get his very important trends journal.
[01:56:47.248 --> 01:56:48.450]  That I read monthly.
[01:56:49.031 --> 01:56:52.657]  It's as invaluable as the International Forecaster with Bob Chapman.
[01:56:52.677 --> 01:56:56.764]  If you want a free copy of that when you buy one franc, you can get it at 800-686-2237.
[01:56:56.784 --> 01:56:57.945]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:01.482 --> 01:57:05.123]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:57:05.443 --> 01:57:13.565]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:57:14.306 --> 01:57:18.347]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:57:18.927 --> 01:57:29.750]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:57:30.370 --> 01:57:39.392]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:57:39.892 --> 01:57:44.913]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:57:45.314 --> 01:57:52.515]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:57:52.795 --> 01:57:55.556]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:57:59.397 --> 01:58:03.639]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:03.959 --> 01:58:08.022]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:08.282 --> 01:58:13.705]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:58:14.045 --> 01:58:14.485]  It's true.
[01:58:14.785 --> 01:58:19.328]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:58:19.648 --> 01:58:20.189]  Number 3.
[01:58:20.469 --> 01:58:23.752]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:58:24.052 --> 01:58:27.795]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:58:27.976 --> 01:58:28.236]  Number 4.
[01:58:28.776 --> 01:58:31.138]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:58:31.539 --> 01:58:34.922]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:58:35.222 --> 01:58:35.422]  Number 5.
[01:58:36.003 --> 01:58:39.926]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:58:40.147 --> 01:58:44.911]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:58:45.191 --> 01:58:49.233]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:58:49.353 --> 01:58:50.934]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:58:51.154 --> 01:58:53.235]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:58:53.415 --> 01:58:55.756]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:58:59.226 --> 01:59:06.088]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:59:06.208 --> 01:59:07.448]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:59:07.488 --> 01:59:08.169]  It's very real.
[01:59:08.309 --> 01:59:12.070]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[01:59:12.190 --> 01:59:16.531]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[01:59:16.671 --> 01:59:19.032]  Clean, great-tasting water without all the pollutants.
[01:59:19.252 --> 01:59:23.873]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[01:59:23.953 --> 01:59:25.054]  For your home or business.

[01:59:30.037 --> 01:59:32.780]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:35.502]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[01:59:35.602 --> 01:59:42.747]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.

[01:59:59.912 --> 02:00:05.013]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:05.333 --> 02:00:07.594]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:00:09.281 --> 02:00:13.404]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it is March 5th, 2010 on this Friday edition.
[02:00:13.424 --> 02:00:20.909]  For the next 52 minutes, we're joined by a man who is in massive demand, and we appreciate him joining us once a month, Gerald Cilente.
[02:00:21.210 --> 02:00:26.954]  He's a big part of my two latest films, Fall of the Republic and The Obama Deception, in the last year.
[02:00:27.594 --> 02:00:31.097]  And unfortunately, the predictions he made in the films have now come true.
[02:00:31.437 --> 02:00:34.220]  Films available at Infowars.com.
[02:00:34.660 --> 02:00:41.547]  We will put his Trends Research website up on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:00:41.607 --> 02:00:44.009]  We thank God he got out of Chile safely.
[02:00:44.049 --> 02:00:45.010]  He's got a great tan.
[02:00:45.050 --> 02:00:50.775]  I saw him there on the video connection to New York, so looks like his vacation turned out okay.
[02:00:51.075 --> 02:00:52.917]  Gerald Cilente, great to have you here with us.
[02:00:53.697 --> 02:00:54.137]  Thank you.
[02:00:54.177 --> 02:01:03.883]  And listen, I want to mention, Alex, that the reviews we keep getting from The Obama Deception and The Fall of the Republic are astounding.
[02:01:04.584 --> 02:01:19.773]  And I congratulate you for putting on and putting the work into, I know the hard work that you do, to making two great documentary films that, again, we just keep getting compliments on day in and day out.
[02:01:20.558 --> 02:01:22.939]  Well, thank you for being part of the films, Gerald.
[02:01:23.379 --> 02:01:26.561]  And, of course, we've interviewed you for the next Fall of the Republic that's coming out as well.
[02:01:27.321 --> 02:01:32.304]  Again, founder of the Trends Research Institute in 1980, Gerald Cilente is a pioneer trends strategist.
[02:01:32.724 --> 02:01:44.830]  He is author of the national bestseller Trends 2000 and Trend Tracking, Far Better Than Megatrends, and that's what Warner Books said, and publisher of the internationally circulated Trends Journal newsletter.
[02:01:45.230 --> 02:01:48.752]  What's the best way for people to get your Trends newsletter?
[02:01:49.704 --> 02:01:53.526]  TransJournal.com, that's TransJournal.com.
[02:01:54.246 --> 02:01:55.566]  They could go to our website.
[02:01:55.847 --> 02:02:00.689]  And I also want to make it very clear that we know that people are going through difficult times.
[02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:01.629]  So we have a...
[02:02:03.189 --> 02:02:05.071]  Oh, we just lost our video connection.
[02:02:05.111 --> 02:02:07.753]  We may do phone with him, because that's been happening.
[02:02:08.273 --> 02:02:09.654]  Let's try to reconnect.
[02:02:09.714 --> 02:02:12.296]  Let's do video one more time and see if it works.
[02:02:12.717 --> 02:02:15.599]  In five years, it'll be crisp, totally clear video.
[02:02:15.619 --> 02:02:20.023]  It looks pretty clear today, and it'll never cut out, but these new technologies and
[02:02:21.676 --> 02:02:24.918]  It seems like just regular web phone would be better.
[02:02:24.978 --> 02:02:26.940]  Just regular webcam or something.
[02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:28.561]  I don't know about this Skype.
[02:02:29.361 --> 02:02:34.985]  Russia Today and British TV is always having me on via Skype and we have the same thing happen from our end.
[02:02:35.485 --> 02:02:39.848]  So we're going to continue with Gerald Cilente breaking down the trends here.
[02:02:40.629 --> 02:02:43.771]  Again, joining us live on the radio and at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:02:47.634 --> 02:02:51.856]  And I do want to remind you that, again, fall the republic, Obama deception.
[02:02:52.296 --> 02:02:54.738]  These films break down the full spectrum of what's happening.
[02:02:55.698 --> 02:02:56.478]  And people need to get them.
[02:02:56.739 --> 02:02:59.300]  Okay, Gerald, sorry, the video connection fell out.
[02:02:59.340 --> 02:03:04.242]  You were saying that you had a special offer for those that normally can't afford the Trans-Journal?
[02:03:05.043 --> 02:03:05.283]  Right.
[02:03:05.343 --> 02:03:06.784]  These are very difficult times.
[02:03:06.944 --> 02:03:08.464]  We want people to be prepared.
[02:03:08.945 --> 02:03:13.327]  We make it available to just about anyone that could afford it within their means.
[02:03:14.827 --> 02:03:16.968]  Okay, let's cut to the chase here.
[02:03:17.268 --> 02:03:18.328]  What happened in Chile?
[02:03:18.389 --> 02:03:20.930]  You were there for the big, massive earthquake.
[02:03:21.330 --> 02:03:26.132]  And then let's get into what's currently happening with Greece and the world and the banks.
[02:03:26.992 --> 02:03:38.077]  Well, what's important about Chile, being that I escaped alive, is that one of the top trends that we listed in our Trends Journal for 2010 is neo-survivalism.
[02:03:39.042 --> 02:03:48.152]  The systems are breaking down at every level, and people need to be aware of this, because when the worst happens, they have to be prepared.
[02:03:48.653 --> 02:03:50.415]  You don't wait for things to happen.
[02:03:50.455 --> 02:03:56.301]  If they do happen, you must take the most advanced measures you can to survive.
[02:03:56.481 --> 02:04:00.105]  Physical, physical, psychological, you name it.
[02:04:00.746 --> 02:04:04.971]  And it really went into practice in what happened to us in Chile.
[02:04:05.011 --> 02:04:06.793]  We got there on a Thursday night.
[02:04:08.475 --> 02:04:11.077]  Saturday morning, I was jolted out of bed.
[02:04:11.118 --> 02:04:12.779]  I felt the first tremors.
[02:04:12.879 --> 02:04:17.905]  I was with one of my colleagues who were on a South American tour, a fact-finding mission.
[02:04:19.787 --> 02:04:27.053]  You know, knowing it was an earthquake zone, I immediately, you know, just put on my pants, put on my shoes, grabbed my jacket.
[02:04:27.093 --> 02:04:31.876]  By the time I grabbed my jacket, we're on the 14th floor of the Crowne Plaza Hotel.
[02:04:32.317 --> 02:04:39.042]  The television went flying, drawers flew out of their bureaus, chairs toppling over, lamps.
[02:04:39.963 --> 02:04:43.485]  Alex, I was the first guy down 14 flights of stairs.
[02:04:44.386 --> 02:04:50.448]  And what's astonishing is that there was only one other person besides my pal that was right behind me.
[02:04:50.968 --> 02:04:55.109]  And that was somebody, you know, praying in Spanish as they were coming down the stairs.
[02:04:55.609 --> 02:05:01.270]  The point being is that after the earthquake, we started interviewing people.
[02:05:01.351 --> 02:05:02.631]  Most people froze.
[02:05:03.371 --> 02:05:09.753]  Either went under the desks, they went into bathtubs, hid under doorways.
[02:05:10.394 --> 02:05:13.875]  They called the front desk, they waited for tour operators.
[02:05:14.395 --> 02:05:16.896]  They did not take proactive measures.
[02:05:17.376 --> 02:05:19.257]  They didn't prepare for the worst.
[02:05:19.897 --> 02:05:27.380]  And then I'm cutting through the story very quickly, because when we finally got outside, and we wanted to get away from the building,
[02:05:28.300 --> 02:05:30.502]  All of a sudden, you know, this is 4 a.m.
[02:05:30.582 --> 02:05:35.245]  in Chile, you know, the Latins are out late at night having a good time.
[02:05:35.265 --> 02:05:43.170]  50, 60 guys come screaming down the streets, knocking over everybody and anything in their way and mugging them.
[02:05:43.590 --> 02:05:47.693]  You know, so we had to use a lot of defensive measures to stay alive.
[02:05:48.033 --> 02:05:52.676]  And I'm mentioning this because these are the kind of conditions that exist today.
[02:05:52.976 --> 02:05:56.078]  It's the products that you sell on your radio station.
[02:05:56.519 --> 02:05:58.240]  It's about that solar panel.
[02:05:58.540 --> 02:06:07.266]  It's about having that excess of food in the eventuality of a terrorism 2012, which is on the horizon.
[02:06:07.586 --> 02:06:09.647]  It's about those food shortages.
[02:06:10.007 --> 02:06:11.929]  It's about preparing for the worst.
[02:06:12.569 --> 02:06:15.916]  If the worst doesn't happen, great, you were prepared.
[02:06:16.237 --> 02:06:19.765]  But if the worst happens and you're not prepared, guess what?
[02:06:20.186 --> 02:06:21.268]  Jack, you're dead.
[02:06:22.398 --> 02:06:36.226]  In fact, years ago, you moved out of New York City and moved to a rural area and have been getting prepared and predicted the financial collapse in 2008 that you believe, and now they're openly saying the news, will lead to total collapse in the next three years.
[02:06:36.926 --> 02:06:39.568]  And again, I don't think of myself as a tough guy.
[02:06:39.588 --> 02:06:40.588]  I know you don't.
[02:06:40.608 --> 02:06:41.789]  We're just regular guys.
[02:06:42.309 --> 02:06:48.733]  But five years ago, six years ago now, I was in a restaurant, a La Madeline restaurant,
[02:06:50.177 --> 02:07:08.663]  And I went in the bathroom, my wife and son are outside eating in the main area, and I come out, everybody's screaming and yelling, and I had to fight through people when a woman was turning purple, choking, and they got mad at me when I started doing a Heimlich saying, no, wait for 911, wait for the ambulance, and they were just shouting, call 911!
[02:07:08.743 --> 02:07:08.943]  Call 911!
[02:07:11.604 --> 02:07:12.024]  Call 9-1-1!
[02:07:26.869 --> 02:07:34.698]  It was like bizarre, at first bad that I was gonna try to save her, and then I was a hero once I did it, and it's like learned helplessness.
[02:07:34.738 --> 02:07:37.782]  People just hide in their bathtubs or they call the police.
[02:07:37.802 --> 02:07:42.768]  You know, I hear these 911 calls where a woman calls the police when a killer is coming in to rape them.
[02:07:43.388 --> 02:07:45.891]  And then it's bizarre to have a gun.
[02:07:45.951 --> 02:07:47.412]  It's bizarre to know how to fight.
[02:07:47.973 --> 02:07:51.596]  I mean, I see it's like people in Nazi Germany running into pits to be shot.
[02:07:51.897 --> 02:07:57.222]  Or I saw the execution videos from Nigeria, where they were killing people and then directing them into the street to shoot more.
[02:07:57.542 --> 02:07:59.564]  These guys could have run into an alley or got away.
[02:07:59.624 --> 02:08:04.529]  They marched up under orders, knowing they were going to be killed, and laid down and submitted.
[02:08:04.549 --> 02:08:06.992]  I don't understand this, Gerald.
[02:08:09.192 --> 02:08:09.872]  He dropped again.
[02:08:09.892 --> 02:08:12.993]  Okay, we'll try one more time and then that's it.
[02:08:13.534 --> 02:08:14.314]  Yeah, let's do phone.
[02:08:15.554 --> 02:08:16.855]  He didn't even hear my story there.
[02:08:17.215 --> 02:08:32.221]  But there he is in an earthquake, and I would imagine this is mainly Westerners in the hotel, from what it sounds like, and everyone is just submitting, everyone is just groveling, everyone is just in a catatonic fetal position, but the criminals
[02:08:33.101 --> 02:08:35.423]  They knew when there was an earthquake, it's time to steal.
[02:08:35.724 --> 02:08:37.285]  Within minutes, they were out stealing.
[02:08:37.485 --> 02:08:38.466]  And see, that's the government.
[02:08:38.726 --> 02:08:40.448]  Never let a good crisis go to waste.
[02:08:41.069 --> 02:08:43.831]  Never let a good crisis go to waste.
[02:08:44.932 --> 02:08:45.273]  Okay.
[02:08:45.653 --> 02:08:47.034]  Okay, Gerald, you're back with us.
[02:08:47.054 --> 02:08:54.281]  I was telling the story of a restaurant watching a woman choke, and people trying to stop me from saving her, saying, call 911.
[02:08:57.082 --> 02:08:57.302]  Yeah.
[02:08:57.883 --> 02:09:03.127]  You know, the other thing, too, is when all this violence broke out, there were no police around.
[02:09:03.547 --> 02:09:04.628]  You're on your own.
[02:09:05.429 --> 02:09:09.672]  And the other element of neo-survivalism is to belong to a group.
[02:09:10.172 --> 02:09:11.854]  You know, like-minded people.
[02:09:11.914 --> 02:09:13.976]  Start talking and thinking about this.
[02:09:14.416 --> 02:09:17.038]  You know, I'm a close combat martial artist.
[02:09:17.378 --> 02:09:25.184]  We contacted our master, John Perkins, at attackproof.com, and he sent out a global SOS.
[02:09:25.965 --> 02:09:30.648]  Within sight of hours, we had direct connections to the embassy.
[02:09:30.968 --> 02:09:43.977]  There were people in Chile and Argentina offering lodging and funds, and one person contacted us and gave us an escape route and strategy to get to Mendoza, Argentina.
[02:09:44.537 --> 02:09:55.725]  And so it's those kind of things, having a network of people that you could rely on, because we only were able to go so far, and then the others helped us go further.
[02:09:56.586 --> 02:10:04.491]  So again, it's about having your own community, and you're part of the community that's all over the world, and it was invaluable.
[02:10:05.211 --> 02:10:05.772]  Exactly.
[02:10:06.052 --> 02:10:07.353]  Well, I wouldn't be here today.
[02:10:07.393 --> 02:10:08.974]  I would still be stuck over there.
[02:10:09.274 --> 02:10:11.796]  The airport was down, the roads were destroyed.
[02:10:11.816 --> 02:10:16.259]  You know, so we had to use another strategy, and it's that community.
[02:10:16.539 --> 02:10:18.500]  And by the way, all things are connected.
[02:10:18.801 --> 02:10:20.462]  You know, it goes back to the economy.
[02:10:20.942 --> 02:10:23.264]  How are we going to have a strong economy?
[02:10:23.484 --> 02:10:24.485]  Well, guess what?
[02:10:24.745 --> 02:10:27.087]  You know, I'm a believer in the golden rule.
[02:10:27.508 --> 02:10:29.349]  Those who have the gold rule.
[02:10:29.710 --> 02:10:34.494]  And if we're going to send all our money to China, guess who's going to rule us?
[02:10:34.974 --> 02:10:41.860]  If we start doing business with each other, start being a community of Americans again, guess what?
[02:10:42.140 --> 02:10:43.822]  We'll survive and thrive.
[02:10:44.122 --> 02:10:45.263]  It's all connected.
[02:10:46.616 --> 02:10:48.058]  Well, I mean, what do you call this?
[02:10:48.138 --> 02:10:49.040]  Learned helplessness?
[02:10:49.060 --> 02:10:53.747]  Because 50 years ago, if a woman was choking, most people would go over to do a Heimlich.
[02:10:54.908 --> 02:10:58.614]  50 years ago, I would imagine Westerners in that hotel would have gotten up and got out.
[02:10:58.974 --> 02:11:01.318]  Why do people wait for someone else to save them?
[02:11:02.196 --> 02:11:04.698]  Well, you know, I heard the end of this story.
[02:11:04.718 --> 02:11:08.461]  A similar story happened to me up in Hudson, New York.
[02:11:09.322 --> 02:11:11.524]  I saw a guy that started to choke.
[02:11:12.485 --> 02:11:14.507]  His daughter didn't know what to do.
[02:11:14.867 --> 02:11:16.388]  They yelled out for a doctor.
[02:11:16.448 --> 02:11:17.849]  Nobody knew what to do.
[02:11:18.590 --> 02:11:26.915]  A woman went behind the guy, I didn't know how to do the Heimlich Maneuver, and I saw her do it, and I saw that she wasn't strong enough.
[02:11:27.315 --> 02:11:31.298]  And she wasn't doing it, you know, knowing how the body works a bit.
[02:11:31.698 --> 02:11:42.465]  And I just moved her aside gently, and I started doing it on him, and all of a sudden... We're now going to switch to phone.
[02:11:42.685 --> 02:11:43.205]  It's okay.
[02:11:43.465 --> 02:11:44.506]  Go ahead and hand him the phone.
[02:11:44.546 --> 02:11:45.667]  We have the phone as a backup.
[02:11:47.296 --> 02:11:56.402]  But the bigger issue was that I had to start, I said, I'll do the Heimlich, you know, because I had that in swim team, like the half day course.
[02:11:56.422 --> 02:12:04.828]  I didn't have the full certification, but I put my hands under, you know, her rib cage right there in the bread basket and a couple of heaves and a big piece of bread came out.
[02:12:05.088 --> 02:12:06.009]  Do we have Gerald back now?
[02:12:10.131 --> 02:12:10.372]  Okay.
[02:12:11.601 --> 02:12:23.709]  Well, luckily we got 40 more minutes here and I skipped this break, so we'll pick up the time we've lost here, because I want to get into his trends and where he sees the economy is going with Gerald Solente.
[02:12:24.950 --> 02:12:31.854]  But again, ladies and gentlemen, it is not heroic to save someone who's choking.
[02:12:32.275 --> 02:12:33.235]  She would have died.
[02:12:34.996 --> 02:12:36.517]  I mean, she was turning blue.
[02:12:36.677 --> 02:12:38.559]  I'd just been in the bathroom two minutes when I came out.
[02:12:39.059 --> 02:12:40.320]  If no one would have called,
[02:12:41.778 --> 02:12:46.641]  If no one would have helped her and just called the police and waited for them to get there in five minutes, she would have choked.
[02:12:46.681 --> 02:12:49.543]  I mean, it's just chanting like parrots.
[02:12:49.803 --> 02:12:50.144]  Call 9-1-1!
[02:12:50.164 --> 02:12:50.424]  Call 9-1-1!
[02:12:50.504 --> 02:12:50.904]  Call 9-1-1!
[02:12:51.525 --> 02:12:51.885]  Call 9-1-1!
[02:12:51.905 --> 02:12:54.306]  And that's what our society has turned into.
[02:13:04.269 --> 02:13:07.571]  Yeah, and then all of a sudden, food came flying out of his mouth.
[02:13:07.631 --> 02:13:08.451]  He was choking to death.
[02:13:08.472 --> 02:13:09.272]  He was nearly blue.
[02:13:09.292 --> 02:13:11.693]  And then we found out there was a doctor in the house.
[02:13:12.154 --> 02:13:13.755]  The doctor was afraid to get involved.
[02:13:30.191 --> 02:13:32.153]  And that's what's going on more and more.
[02:13:32.574 --> 02:13:34.296]  People are afraid to get involved.
[02:13:34.316 --> 02:13:35.837]  They're afraid to speak up.
[02:13:36.218 --> 02:13:39.381]  They're afraid to regain their dignity and respect.
[02:13:39.902 --> 02:13:42.765]  And that's why people are following their leaders.
[02:13:43.406 --> 02:13:46.129]  We're in these times of survival.
[02:13:46.529 --> 02:13:49.112]  People should be in survival mode.
[02:13:49.790 --> 02:13:51.151]  And they're not doing it.
[02:13:51.391 --> 02:13:53.952]  They still believe in hope and change.
[02:13:54.412 --> 02:14:00.215]  And they'll make a million excuses as to why they're not doing what they should be doing.
[02:14:00.615 --> 02:14:02.797]  It's like the lottery ticket syndrome.
[02:14:02.817 --> 02:14:10.540]  Instead of going out and getting an extra job or becoming an entrepreneur, people really think they're going to get a lottery ticket and that's going to save them.
[02:14:10.861 --> 02:14:12.321]  It's that perceived hope.
[02:14:13.742 --> 02:14:14.422]  Exactly.
[02:14:14.582 --> 02:14:15.383]  And again,
[02:14:15.856 --> 02:14:18.057]  You know, they're buffaloing the people.
[02:14:18.117 --> 02:14:27.262]  I was listening to Bob Chapman and yourself about the moronic media that we have that keeps telling people everything's okay.
[02:14:27.582 --> 02:14:33.885]  They keep rolling out these Wall Street shills that are selling things and telling people to invest.
[02:14:34.305 --> 02:14:40.068]  I mean, you have to be out of your mind, I believe, to put a penny into the equity markets.
[02:14:40.588 --> 02:14:43.850]  What imbecile doesn't see what's going on?
[02:14:44.443 --> 02:14:53.066]  Blackpool's high-frequency trading, insider trading, made-offs and whip-offs.
[02:14:53.746 --> 02:15:05.690]  Any rookie out there that thinks that they have a shot in this game is like the person that's playing the lottery, thinking if you're in it, you could win it.
[02:15:06.909 --> 02:15:09.930]  The only group winning is the casino.
[02:15:10.951 --> 02:15:16.594]  Gerald Cilente, I want to now, in the time we've got with you, break down the trends.
[02:15:16.614 --> 02:15:22.316]  You've been right about the economy, spot on, where it's going, what the big predatory banks are doing.
[02:15:22.677 --> 02:15:23.317]  I want to talk about
[02:15:23.797 --> 02:15:26.458]  You know Alex, I've narrowed it down to six simple words.
[02:15:53.246 --> 02:15:55.048]  Princeton, Harvard, Yale.
[02:15:55.889 --> 02:15:57.711]  Bullets, bombs, and banks.
[02:15:59.072 --> 02:16:00.393]  That's all it's about.
[02:16:00.734 --> 02:16:01.454]  Say that again.
[02:16:02.075 --> 02:16:04.077]  Princeton, Harvard, Yale.
[02:16:04.858 --> 02:16:06.780]  Bullets, bombs, and banks.
[02:16:07.941 --> 02:16:12.005]  That's the whole game wrapped up in six simple words.
[02:16:13.186 --> 02:16:16.970]  And they're robbing us blind and they're sending us to our death.
[02:16:17.739 --> 02:16:41.054]  And you just look at the history, going back to Woodrow Wilson, that president of Princeton, who put us into the great war that every historian worth a nickel knows was the most unnecessary war of the 20th century, to the wars following from the Yale-Clinton group, the McNamara group, you know, the Ivy League boys.
[02:16:41.724 --> 02:16:42.424]  The elites.
[02:16:42.804 --> 02:16:47.867]  And they're running the country, they're running the world, they're running the banks, they're running the military.
[02:16:48.587 --> 02:16:53.569]  And so what's going on now is they're just trying to keep this game afloat.
[02:16:53.989 --> 02:16:55.570]  And it's a worldwide game.
[02:16:56.050 --> 02:17:08.535]  They're dumping in stimulus money from China to India to Australia, UK, South Korea, Japan, US, you name the country.
[02:17:09.222 --> 02:17:14.746]  All they're doing is printing fiat money to keep the Ponzi scheme going.
[02:17:15.026 --> 02:17:21.110]  Excuse me, Ponzi was a piker, let's call it a Madoff scheme, to keep it going.
[02:17:21.651 --> 02:17:30.156]  So the people that think that there's going to be a recovery are going to be thrown out into the streets.
[02:17:30.657 --> 02:17:33.739]  The real estate market is not recovering.
[02:17:34.321 --> 02:17:36.522]  The unemployment numbers came out today.
[02:17:36.802 --> 02:17:43.584]  They're applauding that they weren't as high as they believed they were going to be, or predicted they were going to be.
[02:17:43.924 --> 02:17:58.268]  We have to create 1.5 million jobs a year just to stay even, and they're jumping up like trained seals, clapping their hands, saying it wasn't as bad as they thought it was.
[02:17:58.708 --> 02:18:00.668]  Jobs are not being created.
[02:18:01.009 --> 02:18:02.249]  They're being lost.
[02:18:02.748 --> 02:18:05.053]  We're going to see the crash of 2010.
[02:18:06.575 --> 02:18:10.703]  Greece is the canary in the economic mineshaft.
[02:18:11.224 --> 02:18:13.549]  And they're only the small player in it.
[02:18:14.096 --> 02:18:16.617]  Everyone's yelling about Greece, Greece.
[02:18:17.077 --> 02:18:19.639]  Oh, their GDP is 13%.
[02:18:19.959 --> 02:18:24.201]  Excuse me, their budget deficit is 13% of their GDP.
[02:18:24.521 --> 02:18:29.323]  It's only supposed to be 3% according to the European Monetary Union.
[02:18:29.343 --> 02:18:31.124]  Hey, what is it in England?
[02:18:31.544 --> 02:18:35.086]  Oh, about 13% of budget deficit to GDP.
[02:18:35.466 --> 02:18:37.327]  And what is it in the United States?
[02:18:37.887 --> 02:18:40.248]  Oh, about 11% of budget deficit to GDP.
[02:18:42.475 --> 02:18:47.717]  This is a global sovereign debt crisis that's not going to end.
[02:18:48.177 --> 02:18:58.941]  And our greatest fear, Alex, is when all else fails, Princeton, Harvard, Yale, bullets, bombs, and banks.
[02:19:00.544 --> 02:19:01.324]  Absolutely.
[02:19:01.685 --> 02:19:04.046]  What's the word on war from your research?
[02:19:04.106 --> 02:19:08.067]  It looks like an Iran attack is moving towards the front burner again.
[02:19:08.087 --> 02:19:08.687]  It is.
[02:19:08.928 --> 02:19:11.529]  And they keep pushing it out there and pushing it out there.
[02:19:11.849 --> 02:19:13.970]  And we've said this over and over again.
[02:19:14.750 --> 02:19:20.452]  If anybody invades Iran, it's the beginning of World War III.
[02:19:21.013 --> 02:19:22.333]  These are the Persians.
[02:19:22.973 --> 02:19:28.676]  Like them or not, whatever your gender ideology is, put it on the shelf, folks.
[02:19:29.420 --> 02:19:32.943]  The Iranians fought the Iraqis for eight years.
[02:19:33.003 --> 02:19:47.016]  Remember Donald Rumsfeld giving Saddam Hussein those golden spurs to keep riding that war further and further into Iran that the United States was a proxy in?
[02:19:47.476 --> 02:19:53.702]  Well, the Iranians didn't give up one inch of territory, lost nearly a million people,
[02:19:54.315 --> 02:19:59.457]  And they're not going to go down if Israel or the United States attacks.
[02:19:59.777 --> 02:20:02.578]  And now they've got 20 times the weapons that they did before.
[02:20:02.898 --> 02:20:03.578]  Exactly.
[02:20:06.119 --> 02:20:07.519]  So that's what we're concerned about.
[02:20:08.020 --> 02:20:08.720]  Unbelievable.
[02:20:09.060 --> 02:20:18.723]  Oh, by the way, we're also concerned now about another blow up in the Middle East with Israel and the Palestinians.
[02:20:19.343 --> 02:20:20.784]  There is no peace plan.
[02:20:22.455 --> 02:20:26.937]  The conditions are worsening in the occupied territories.
[02:20:27.978 --> 02:20:35.602]  The Israelis are continuing to take more and more settlement property, Palestinian property.
[02:20:36.242 --> 02:20:39.524]  And now there's talk about demolishing more homes.
[02:20:40.024 --> 02:20:42.866]  There is no freeze on settlements.
[02:20:43.402 --> 02:20:53.067]  So we're concerned also that something might happen there that will spill over into Lebanon, even possibly Syria, and spread throughout the Middle East.
[02:20:53.127 --> 02:20:57.049]  These are all probabilities that are growing concerns.
[02:20:58.670 --> 02:20:59.651]  Shifting gears.
[02:21:01.189 --> 02:21:01.249]  to
[02:21:25.097 --> 02:21:29.501]  The health care plan saying it's going to seize unions' money.
[02:21:30.301 --> 02:21:34.665]  They're talking about the banks are saying, we may hold your money for seven days.
[02:21:35.165 --> 02:21:36.767]  Your money markets aren't insured.
[02:21:37.407 --> 02:21:38.908]  The looting going on.
[02:21:39.129 --> 02:21:41.871]  What is the elite thinking and what are the people going to do?
[02:21:42.391 --> 02:21:44.473]  Three years ago, you predicted the tea parties.
[02:21:45.153 --> 02:21:46.935]  Now, where do you predict all that's going?
[02:21:46.955 --> 02:21:50.138]  We'll talk to Gerald Salinde, top trends forecaster, straight ahead.
[02:21:50.158 --> 02:21:50.878]  We're on the march.
[02:21:51.359 --> 02:21:52.880]  The empire's on the run.
[02:21:53.877 --> 02:21:56.678]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:59.639 --> 02:22:02.359]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.
[02:22:02.659 --> 02:22:08.421]  Well, here's an unbelievable chance for you to jumpstart your food savings plan from efoodsdirect.com.
[02:22:08.681 --> 02:22:16.523]  Anyone placing food orders on the large-volume production run scheduled for the week of March 22nd can get a lot of food for very little cost.
[02:22:16.943 --> 02:22:23.068]  For example, with each pre-production order of three 7-Day Responders, they'll ship a fourth week of food free.

[02:24:52.705 --> 02:24:54.366]  We know without a shadow of a doubt
[02:25:09.468 --> 02:25:13.832]  That the underwear bombing on Christmas Day was staged to sell the naked body scanners they'd already ordered.
[02:25:14.472 --> 02:25:16.854]  The witnesses all said the government let him on the plane.
[02:25:16.874 --> 02:25:17.755]  There was an argument.
[02:25:18.055 --> 02:25:18.996]  He had no ID.
[02:25:19.336 --> 02:25:22.039]  Turns out the State Department was ordered by the CIA to let him on.
[02:25:22.359 --> 02:25:24.821]  That was in mainstream five newspapers.
[02:25:25.121 --> 02:25:27.543]  The State Department admitted it, but it got no attention.
[02:25:28.604 --> 02:25:31.286]  The stack thing is very suspicious, we've now discovered.
[02:25:32.668 --> 02:25:35.790]  For two years, the Fort Hood shooter was protected.
[02:25:36.090 --> 02:25:37.492]  Thought he was talking to Al-Qaeda.
[02:25:38.396 --> 02:25:41.759]  The operative he was talking to is the guy that always runs patsies.
[02:25:42.260 --> 02:25:43.641]  So some of these are useful idiots.
[02:25:44.642 --> 02:25:47.665]  In every case, their parents warned them, or family warned.
[02:25:48.165 --> 02:25:52.149]  Associated Press, parents of Pentagon shooter warned authorities.
[02:25:53.010 --> 02:25:54.772]  And this guy looks like a complete psycho.
[02:25:55.072 --> 02:25:57.575]  Headlines, 9-11 truther shoots cops.
[02:25:59.697 --> 02:26:00.758]  They're saying, I mean, folks.
[02:26:02.273 --> 02:26:05.474]  Here's Watson's newest article, Pentagon shooting, now everyone's a terrorist.
[02:26:05.514 --> 02:26:09.275]  I'm going to ask Gerald Cilente about staged events, get his take on that coming up.
[02:26:09.295 --> 02:26:17.298]  But Gerald, the last question, and then I just want you to run through other predictions and pick your genius brain here, because, I mean, folks, I only give credit where it's due.
[02:26:17.338 --> 02:26:28.001]  He really, this guy's a top trends forecaster, and Bob's great as well at the economics, but a generalist here with Gerald Cilente who just researches constantly.
[02:26:29.068 --> 02:26:39.552]  It seems like they're pushing us towards rebellion, or is it just they don't care, they're all busy stealing, so they don't care if they raise hundreds of new taxes and just bankrupt everyone.
[02:26:39.572 --> 02:26:40.753]  I mean, where is that going?
[02:26:41.353 --> 02:26:42.273]  Well, they don't care.
[02:26:42.313 --> 02:26:43.894]  Look at the lives that they live.
[02:26:44.454 --> 02:26:48.256]  You know, I began my career at a graduate school.
[02:26:48.336 --> 02:26:55.539]  I was involved with the mayoral campaign in Yonkers, New York, and then in Westchester politics as a campaign strategist.
[02:26:56.279 --> 02:26:58.140]  And then they sent me up to Albany.
[02:26:59.204 --> 02:27:00.805]  Nobody is making the news now.
[02:27:01.125 --> 02:27:04.367]  And I was the assistant to the Secretary of the New York State Senate.
[02:27:04.948 --> 02:27:07.329]  Alex, it was the worst job I've ever had in my life.
[02:27:07.689 --> 02:27:12.092]  And I had some lousy jobs as a young guy, as many of us did.
[02:27:12.752 --> 02:27:19.957]  And what it would be is I'd be standing in the back of the chambers with my pal chit-chatting about this or that, a young guy in my 20s.
[02:27:20.557 --> 02:27:22.358]  And all of a sudden, a senator would walk in.
[02:27:23.099 --> 02:27:26.481]  And my pal would follow the senator like a little puppy dog.
[02:27:27.213 --> 02:27:30.235]  And help pull out the chair to help him sit down.
[02:27:31.016 --> 02:27:33.578]  And my friend would come back and I'd say, hey, what's the matter?
[02:27:33.618 --> 02:27:35.519]  The cat can't sit down by himself?
[02:27:35.979 --> 02:27:36.860]  He needs some help?
[02:27:37.540 --> 02:27:41.703]  The point being, all it was, was watching grown men grovel.
[02:27:42.464 --> 02:27:51.490]  And the way these politicians live, yeah, there's gonna be off with your heads, because these are the kings and the queens and the noblemen.
[02:27:51.974 --> 02:27:52.194]  I don't
[02:28:22.384 --> 02:28:24.605]  I know what a freak show looks like.
[02:28:25.226 --> 02:28:26.587]  It's a freak show.
[02:28:27.347 --> 02:28:29.008]  And that's who these people are.
[02:28:29.629 --> 02:28:32.911]  They have no concern about any of us.
[02:28:33.251 --> 02:28:40.055]  The only thing they're concerned about is maintaining their power and stealing as much as they can.
[02:28:40.395 --> 02:28:42.116]  And this is another important note.
[02:28:42.697 --> 02:28:46.199]  Politicians get paid off very cheaply.
[02:28:46.219 --> 02:28:49.661]  It doesn't take a lot to buy these guys out.
[02:28:50.151 --> 02:28:59.297]  All they're doing is looking for the safe bet and a cushy life where they'll never have to work again in their lives or get their fingernails dirty.
[02:29:01.616 --> 02:29:02.396]  Absolutely.
[02:29:03.137 --> 02:29:16.844]  Now again, three years ago I was reading the journal and you were talking about rebellions, tax rebellions is the term you specifically used, and that's the main basis of the Tea Party that's bipartisan.
[02:29:17.264 --> 02:29:20.606]  The Republicans have tried to take it over, but that's not really being successful.
[02:29:20.646 --> 02:29:25.688]  Now Obama created, separately, the Coffee Party to love and worship the government.
[02:29:25.928 --> 02:29:27.649]  Turns out he's covertly running that.
[02:29:28.169 --> 02:29:30.811]  So they're trying to take these over, but I don't see that working.
[02:29:31.931 --> 02:29:37.473]  So, now going forward, how do you see the rebellions against government peacefully unfolding?
[02:29:38.014 --> 02:29:40.414]  And do you see people violently lashing out?
[02:29:41.615 --> 02:29:47.457]  It's up in the air because you were mentioning before about these false flags and staged events.
[02:29:48.057 --> 02:29:55.580]  You know, from Remember the Maine, to the Gulf of Tonkin incident that never happened, to who knows what else.
[02:29:56.280 --> 02:30:00.122]  So they can use something to rally the people around the government again.
[02:30:00.820 --> 02:30:13.768]  You know, on my way down to Buenos Aires, I took my journal that I write in every day, that I began writing, that I had written when 9-11 happened.
[02:30:14.469 --> 02:30:18.011]  And the quotes in there are amazing to relive.
[02:30:18.431 --> 02:30:27.317]  You know, 92% of the people were in favor of the United States bombing Afghanistan.
[02:30:28.755 --> 02:30:40.519]  Days after 9-11, Tony Blair came to the United States, and my note was, he's continually hitting on Iraq.
[02:30:41.100 --> 02:30:52.204]  And then, the same day that he's there, the three days following, the United States and the UK were carpet bombing Iraq.
[02:30:53.706 --> 02:31:04.172]  So you look back at this, you saw how unpopular Bush was before 9-11, and then you see his popularity mushrooming after that.
[02:31:04.592 --> 02:31:07.134]  The same kind of thing could happen now.
[02:31:07.654 --> 02:31:15.658]  One of the areas of war that I didn't mention, that we're most concerned with as well, is what's going on in Pakistan.
[02:31:16.139 --> 02:31:20.941]  The United States is fighting a proxy war there, using the Pakistani army.
[02:31:22.472 --> 02:31:29.776]  Obama, this great Nobel Peace Prize winner, I guess Norway is Orwell's goat backwards.
[02:31:30.437 --> 02:31:37.661]  He has been sending more predator drones, as you well know, into Pakistan.
[02:31:38.041 --> 02:31:44.085]  Three times as many than Bush did during his last year in office.
[02:31:44.545 --> 02:31:48.828]  Thousands of innocent people are being killed.
[02:31:49.198 --> 02:31:55.320]  There are over 200,000 Pakistanis living in the United States.
[02:31:56.321 --> 02:32:12.087]  Now, with weapons of mass destruction available, with the black market being wide open, with the availability of biological warfare, you don't need to be a member of an organized terrorist group
[02:32:12.563 --> 02:32:18.926]  You could just have, maybe, let's call it, as old as the Old Testament, an eye for an eye.
[02:32:19.306 --> 02:32:30.472]  Suppose your family is from South Waziristan, or North Waziristan, or the Swat Valley, and a victim of America's war.
[02:32:30.492 --> 02:32:33.473]  You think you want to get even big time?
[02:32:34.053 --> 02:32:36.174]  Those are the kind of things we're looking for.
[02:32:36.194 --> 02:32:41.157]  The United States will then use that, as they have used it before,
[02:32:41.756 --> 02:32:56.311]  To then rape us of our rights, clamp down harder on us, and all of those sheeple that are looking for leaders will fall in line and follow the government wherever it takes them.
[02:32:56.671 --> 02:33:00.375]  Those are the concerns we have that will derail the revolution.
[02:33:01.619 --> 02:33:06.761]  Absolutely, Gerald Cilente, because in many cases they don't have to stage a classic false flag.
[02:33:06.821 --> 02:33:09.962]  If they attack a country, there are going to be real people to come after them.
[02:33:09.982 --> 02:33:14.463]  You talk about World War I, Germany was clearly the one that was set up in that.
[02:33:15.064 --> 02:33:24.727]  Then, directly out of World War I came Adolf Hitler, who was a really bad guy and did do horrible things, and it now has been declassified that the British were so smart
[02:33:25.467 --> 02:33:36.610]  That in the 1920s, Lord Milner's group and others said, we're going to pressure Germany, they're going to get a corrupt war leader in, we'll fund them, and then we'll destroy Europe again.
[02:33:36.630 --> 02:33:39.491]  I mean, these guys, these guys are smart.
[02:33:40.031 --> 02:33:41.392]  Well, they're shrewd.
[02:33:42.272 --> 02:33:49.514]  I wouldn't use the word smart, I would say they're shrewd, they're sociopaths, they're sick people.
[02:33:50.154 --> 02:33:52.395]  And that's the only kind of people that do these things.
[02:33:52.735 --> 02:33:53.936]  Look what's going on now.
[02:33:53.976 --> 02:33:55.056]  You mentioned Germany.
[02:33:55.772 --> 02:33:56.613]  All of a sudden?
[02:33:56.913 --> 02:33:58.114]  I mean, what did people forget?
[02:33:58.174 --> 02:33:59.135]  World War II?
[02:33:59.456 --> 02:34:02.378]  Now Germany's sending more troops into Afghanistan?
[02:34:02.618 --> 02:34:03.559]  What's going on over there?
[02:34:03.639 --> 02:34:08.344]  And Germany openly runs the EU and is now the third biggest arms producer in the world.
[02:34:08.604 --> 02:34:11.026]  Just like they secretly re-armed before World War II.
[02:34:11.306 --> 02:34:14.930]  And they're calling the shots in the EU on Greece and everything else.
[02:34:15.270 --> 02:34:15.951]  Exactly!
[02:34:16.881 --> 02:34:21.663]  And what the hell, where does everybody have attention deficit disorder?
[02:34:21.683 --> 02:34:23.964]  This is World War II we're talking about!
[02:34:24.224 --> 02:34:25.564]  It wasn't that long ago!
[02:34:25.584 --> 02:34:30.486]  And now the Germans are, now they're marching in Afghanistan?
[02:34:30.806 --> 02:34:32.467]  Where will they march to next?
[02:34:33.749 --> 02:34:39.152]  Well, we know the British are Germanic, and they're always setting up world empires.
[02:34:39.192 --> 02:34:42.874]  And when Germany started rising, the British started World War I with them.
[02:34:43.394 --> 02:34:44.394]  And it's a fact.
[02:34:44.434 --> 02:34:47.176]  The British want to rule the world, the government does, and the Germans do.
[02:34:47.696 --> 02:34:55.140]  And it's come out in the Club of Rome documents, it's come out in their treaties in Bilderberg, that now it's global EU takeover.
[02:34:55.640 --> 02:35:00.406]  Through the banking system and this new Bank of the World Gordon Brown and others are talking about.
[02:35:00.826 --> 02:35:02.468]  They admit we're bankrupting the planet.
[02:35:02.788 --> 02:35:07.474]  Then we're going to offer you the solution of the banks based in Europe running the planet.
[02:35:08.114 --> 02:35:11.458]  And they're saying they have a Democratic leader of the Senate say two days ago.
[02:35:12.199 --> 02:35:13.759]  I don't think Homeland Security can do it.
[02:35:13.800 --> 02:35:16.320]  But what they will do is they'll use the police state tactics
[02:35:38.246 --> 02:35:45.531]  That they did, for example, at the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh, where they called basically martial law.
[02:35:46.152 --> 02:35:49.534]  You know, which is, of course, against the Constitution.
[02:35:49.894 --> 02:35:52.156]  But look at those photos of what happened.
[02:35:52.576 --> 02:36:06.787]  You know, you had these, well, you had the, uh, more police there dressed up with enough body armor to walk through the Battle of the Bulge unscathed, wielding their batons, beating up co-eds.
[02:36:07.614 --> 02:36:17.476]  You know, so that's what we're concerned about, is that the government will then use the local police as their enforcers.
[02:36:17.756 --> 02:36:28.399]  Well, they are federalizing them, and the videos were, they would selectively, anywhere in the city you couldn't be out day or night, and video on YouTube of women coming out of a shop, old women with bags,
[02:36:29.099 --> 02:36:32.340]  And the officers screaming, pointing a billy club, and they start saying, well, okay.
[02:36:32.660 --> 02:36:34.520]  And then they let a police dog bite him.
[02:36:35.001 --> 02:36:42.543]  And then no one was resisting him, so they went to the university at night with the kids in the park, you know, eating food and drinking beer and said, disperse.
[02:36:42.583 --> 02:36:43.803]  And it wasn't even a protest.
[02:36:44.203 --> 02:36:47.484]  And I had a cameraman arrested.
[02:36:48.084 --> 02:36:49.784]  And they took him to the pen.
[02:36:50.284 --> 02:36:52.845]  They were torturing the We Are Change people in the pen.
[02:36:54.065 --> 02:36:54.565]  The U.S.
[02:36:54.725 --> 02:36:55.385]  Army was.
[02:36:55.765 --> 02:36:56.246]  The U.S.
[02:36:56.366 --> 02:37:03.007]  Army called in terror reports on the InfoWars team and said that we tried to attack the Army base.
[02:37:03.487 --> 02:37:05.047]  And then the police came after them.
[02:37:05.747 --> 02:37:11.308]  I mean, it's just... And the police enjoyed it, Gerald.
[02:37:12.048 --> 02:37:14.809]  It's like a spirit of evil has come upon them or something.
[02:37:15.725 --> 02:37:24.667]  Well, this is what happens in this kind of a climate of fear, and they're going to keep pumping it more and more, unfortunately.
[02:37:25.107 --> 02:37:27.887]  Again, there's the other side, too.
[02:37:28.648 --> 02:37:40.050]  This could go many different ways, because the people are now starting to understand that there are laws and justice.
[02:37:40.510 --> 02:37:43.971]  You know, one of my colleagues came up with the word justice.
[02:37:44.011 --> 02:37:45.031]  We were talking about it.
[02:37:45.453 --> 02:37:47.797]  It's only the crap down of the little people.
[02:37:48.177 --> 02:37:50.541]  And he said, yeah, just us.
[02:37:51.583 --> 02:37:52.985]  That's what justice is.
[02:37:53.566 --> 02:37:54.587]  Just us.
[02:37:55.108 --> 02:37:58.253]  It's only the little people that they rough up.
[02:37:58.755 --> 02:37:59.635]  You could imagine.
[02:37:59.856 --> 02:38:02.317]  How about roughing up Rumsfeld?
[02:38:02.737 --> 02:38:05.479]  How about roughing up Cheney or Rove?
[02:38:05.919 --> 02:38:07.900]  How about roughing up Emanuel?
[02:38:08.360 --> 02:38:09.140]  Oh, no, no, no.
[02:38:09.481 --> 02:38:11.542]  They always get the sweet deal.
[02:38:11.822 --> 02:38:17.505]  Like this other sociopath we have all the year in New York, this Elliot Spitzer.
[02:38:17.905 --> 02:38:25.767]  Remember him, the former governor, that used to bust Johns and pass the law to put Johns in jail?
[02:38:25.787 --> 02:38:28.888]  And then he gets caught with a hooker in Washington?
[02:38:29.288 --> 02:38:30.408]  And what do they do?
[02:38:30.768 --> 02:38:31.668]  They let him off.
[02:38:32.388 --> 02:38:34.529]  They let all the big guys off.
[02:38:34.989 --> 02:38:36.489]  It's just us.
[02:38:36.949 --> 02:38:39.570]  That's the only ones that they're after.
[02:38:40.131 --> 02:38:55.240]  And they're using the military powers, they're using the police enforcement to crack down on the little people to keep them in line like they do in all third world countries.
[02:38:55.720 --> 02:39:01.504]  And America's gone from the most egalitarian nation on earth, and this is a fact.
[02:39:02.236 --> 02:39:10.799]  To the nation now, of the developed nations, where the gap between the rich and the poor is the widest in the U.S.
[02:39:11.280 --> 02:39:14.981]  of any of the major countries of the world.
[02:39:15.381 --> 02:39:17.902]  So that's why we have what we have.
[02:39:18.342 --> 02:39:22.644]  It's third world military behavior.
[02:39:23.328 --> 02:39:32.619]  Because our public became third world and very submissive to authority and to tyranny, and we lost our spirit of 1776, but it's being rekindled.
[02:39:33.160 --> 02:39:40.448]  And in the last 14 years I ran corporation documents, I saw the preparations, I saw the third world type police force.
[02:39:41.169 --> 02:39:42.690]  And it's all premeditated.
[02:39:42.730 --> 02:39:44.590]  The bankers have the whole thing set up.
[02:39:45.091 --> 02:39:46.271]  It's totally criminal.
[02:39:46.971 --> 02:39:54.454]  And good Americans don't deserve this, but a lot of the slack-jawed, lazy yuppies do deserve what's going to happen to them.
[02:39:54.814 --> 02:39:57.635]  And the cops out there, they're going to take your pension fund, too.
[02:39:57.956 --> 02:39:59.496]  So don't think you're immune from this.
[02:39:59.556 --> 02:40:01.537]  I know a lot of police are upset about what's happening.
[02:40:01.877 --> 02:40:09.242]  But at the top, you got about a bunch of rotten scum promoting all the other scum up and kicking the good people out of government.
[02:40:09.542 --> 02:40:11.363]  Let's take a quick call from Doug in Oregon.
[02:40:11.383 --> 02:40:12.704]  You're on the air with Gerald Cilente.
[02:40:12.724 --> 02:40:13.285]  Quick question.
[02:40:13.725 --> 02:40:16.006]  Well, I have a question, but I want to tell you real quickly, Alex.
[02:40:16.126 --> 02:40:27.194]  Out here in Cornelius, Oregon, I responded to your call, went to Brad Martin's Airsoft Outlet Northwest, told him when Alex calls, that's InfoWarriors Respond, taking some InfoWarriors bumper stickers, and I'm buying a rifle to support him.
[02:40:27.234 --> 02:40:28.414]  So, I wanted to thank you.
[02:40:28.434 --> 02:40:30.516]  Let me throw that out to Gerald and then let you finish.
[02:40:30.916 --> 02:40:37.242]  Yeah, now the ATF says with no law they're grabbing toy guns that shoot plastic BBs that are totally legal.
[02:40:37.462 --> 02:40:39.644]  They've now seized $50,000 worth.
[02:40:40.605 --> 02:40:42.987]  No indictment, no charge, no letter.
[02:40:43.207 --> 02:40:45.209]  They just say you're not getting your stuff, Mac.
[02:40:46.257 --> 02:40:50.999]  That's right, Alex, and I told him millions of listeners around the world, and as I was there, they were receiving emails.
[02:40:51.039 --> 02:40:53.220]  They got one from Spain, from Europe, phone calls.
[02:40:53.721 --> 02:40:55.642]  So, good job, and I hope everybody responds.
[02:40:55.662 --> 02:40:58.023]  Well, let me get a quick comment from Gerald Solente on that.
[02:40:58.123 --> 02:41:10.449]  I mean, again... You know, the comment is that this really sparked... I mentioned about my story in Chile, and that how we got out was through the community of attackproof.com people, worldwide network.
[02:41:10.862 --> 02:41:15.904]  It's the same thing with the Infoworld.network.
[02:41:16.304 --> 02:41:19.706]  It's the same thing, and this is the perfect story of it.
[02:41:20.066 --> 02:41:24.368]  This is why people have to act as a community of like-minded people.
[02:41:24.688 --> 02:41:26.989]  You know, how did Franklin say it?
[02:41:27.349 --> 02:41:32.771]  You know, we'll hang alone, or... We'll all hang together, or we'll surely hang separate.
[02:41:32.911 --> 02:41:34.272]  That's exactly it.
[02:41:35.472 --> 02:41:36.212]  Absolutely.
[02:41:36.633 --> 02:41:37.513]  Finish up your point, Doug.
[02:41:38.086 --> 02:41:40.227]  Well, I had a question I wanted to ask Mr. Sollente.
[02:41:41.408 --> 02:41:42.188]  Rental properties.
[02:41:42.308 --> 02:41:44.970]  I have a cruddy little rental house and a possible another rental.
[02:41:45.030 --> 02:41:49.492]  Is this the time to get rid of them or should I keep them for an income source since there's no other jobs out there today?
[02:41:49.512 --> 02:41:55.015]  If they're coming in as an income and they're not a financial burden, I would keep them.
[02:41:55.595 --> 02:41:58.217]  Yeah, I mean, if you're big in debt on them, I would get rid of them.
[02:41:58.437 --> 02:42:03.399]  I don't know about your particular area, but if you basically aren't deep in debt with these and they're making money for you, keep them.
[02:42:03.439 --> 02:42:03.880]  Right, Gerald?
[02:42:03.940 --> 02:42:04.380]  That's right.
[02:42:06.107 --> 02:42:06.707]  Thank you, gentlemen.
[02:42:06.747 --> 02:42:07.288]  Thank you very much.
[02:42:07.328 --> 02:42:07.728]  God bless.
[02:42:08.068 --> 02:42:08.688]  Thank you, Doug.
[02:42:08.708 --> 02:42:16.392]  We're going to come back and jam in a call or two from Tosha and Caleb, maybe a few others, with Gerald Salente.
[02:42:16.412 --> 02:42:20.373]  It went by so quick, and we really appreciate Gerald Salente joining us.
[02:42:21.254 --> 02:42:24.835]  Gerald, again, fire out how people can get your great Trends Journal.

[02:42:45.687 --> 02:42:47.387]  Invaluable information.

[02:42:51.488 --> 02:42:52.629]  Final segment straight ahead.

[02:43:29.145 --> 02:43:38.431]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:43:38.471 --> 02:43:45.415]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:43:45.515 --> 02:43:46.355]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:43:46.395 --> 02:43:49.457]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[02:43:49.637 --> 02:43:50.538]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[02:43:56.625 --> 02:43:57.346]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:44:00.910 --> 02:44:04.555]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:44:04.915 --> 02:44:07.939]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:44:08.179 --> 02:44:09.581]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:44:10.262 --> 02:44:12.925]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:44:12.945 --> 02:44:19.150]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:44:19.331 --> 02:44:24.375]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:44:24.536 --> 02:44:34.525]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:44:34.625 --> 02:44:36.727]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:44:36.967 --> 02:44:38.308]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:44:38.568 --> 02:44:40.850]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:44:41.031 --> 02:44:42.872]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:44:43.152 --> 02:44:47.937]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:44:48.297 --> 02:44:57.425]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:45:00.386 --> 02:45:02.849]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.
[02:45:03.129 --> 02:45:08.875]  Well, here's an unbelievable chance for you to jumpstart your food savings plan from efoodsdirect.com.
[02:45:09.156 --> 02:45:17.004]  Anyone placing food orders on the large volume production run scheduled for the week of March 22nd can get a lot of food for very little cost.

[02:45:23.786 --> 02:45:25.747]  That's buy three, get one free.
[02:45:25.947 --> 02:45:28.648]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[02:45:28.848 --> 02:45:36.531]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you in this buy three, get one free program.
[02:45:36.831 --> 02:45:39.592]  Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see.
[02:45:40.092 --> 02:45:40.932]  Another example?
[02:45:41.072 --> 02:45:44.114]  Buy nine months worth of food and get three months free.
[02:45:44.254 --> 02:45:49.396]  You've got to go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex for the food buy of a lifetime.
[02:45:49.416 --> 02:45:50.076]  Or call 800-409-5633.
[02:45:50.136 --> 02:45:51.196]  Go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex or 800-409-5633.
[02:46:02.213 --> 02:46:05.314]  Final segment, I'll be back Sunday live 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:46:05.374 --> 02:46:06.314]  Central, 5 to 7 p.m.
[02:46:06.334 --> 02:46:07.014]  Eastern.
[02:46:07.034 --> 02:46:11.036]  Tasha in Canada, you're on the air with Gerald Salente, go ahead.
[02:46:12.816 --> 02:46:18.018]  Hi there, so here I am in Toronto, Canada, and there's two things that sort of concern me.
[02:46:18.598 --> 02:46:25.760]  There's Bill C-47, which is regarding the internet, and it basically says they're going to
[02:46:26.829 --> 02:46:34.753]  Intercept all your internet transmissions, decrypt it, and give it to any law enforcement agencies or other organizations.
[02:46:34.793 --> 02:46:35.914]  Yeah, with no warrants.
[02:46:36.034 --> 02:46:42.657]  Simultaneously, worldwide, they are openly saying they're going to take over and start shutting down freedom on the internet.
[02:46:42.697 --> 02:46:43.057]  Go ahead.
[02:46:44.538 --> 02:46:46.959]  And they also said they're going to give it to foreign governments.
[02:46:47.199 --> 02:46:49.941]  And I think that's really concerning me a bit more than it counts.
[02:46:50.261 --> 02:46:52.982]  Gerald, let's get a quick comment from him and then your second question.
[02:46:53.763 --> 02:46:55.844]  Why are they openly coming after freedom on the internet?
[02:46:57.227 --> 02:46:59.628]  Because the Internet is the freedom of the people.
[02:47:00.308 --> 02:47:01.929]  And they want to shut that down.
[02:47:02.249 --> 02:47:12.993]  You see, they control the networks, as we all know, and now with the Internet becoming the communications vehicle of the world, they're concerned that they're going to lose control.
[02:47:13.453 --> 02:47:16.154]  And that's why they're taking it over, and they won't stop.
[02:47:16.855 --> 02:47:18.235]  Tasha, what was your other question?
[02:47:19.916 --> 02:47:22.537]  Okay, the other thing I wanted to mention was, here in Toronto,
[02:47:23.447 --> 02:47:27.850]  Less than a week ago, they installed cameras in all the buses and streetcars.
[02:47:28.610 --> 02:47:31.752]  And I didn't see any signs, I just walked in and was like, oh!
[02:47:31.772 --> 02:47:35.814]  Yeah, they're building a giant prison, and I appreciate your call, sir, we've got to cut you short.
[02:47:36.274 --> 02:47:46.280]  Look, they set all this up beforehand, they're openly saying, this is in Wired Magazine, the end of the open internet, that's the headline, and some listeners think we're exaggerating.
[02:47:46.520 --> 02:47:48.121]  This isn't a joke, is it, Gerald?
[02:47:48.441 --> 02:47:51.063]  No, it's not, because again, the internet
[02:47:52.892 --> 02:47:55.353]  That's what's changing the whole game.
[02:47:56.013 --> 02:48:09.139]  And the only reason why we're subjected to what we are is because in order to broadcast on a network, as you well know, it takes hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:48:09.719 --> 02:48:15.422]  But for the Internet, you know, with a small budget, you're a global voice.
[02:48:15.442 --> 02:48:18.663]  You can't do that and have freedom.
[02:48:19.207 --> 02:48:30.281]  So they don't want the freedom, and they're going to cut it down, they're going to take over it, unless it's stopped, which is highly unlikely, as we see it at this point.
[02:48:30.686 --> 02:48:39.473]  And the alternative media, I mean literally, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, get more traffic than Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck combined.
[02:48:39.493 --> 02:48:40.494]  Just one of my sites.
[02:48:40.754 --> 02:48:42.055]  And I'm just one of many people.
[02:48:42.215 --> 02:48:44.276]  Because if you tell the truth, you get a giant audience.
[02:48:44.517 --> 02:48:53.223]  The mainstream media is dying, so they're going along with the shutdown of freedom on the web, because we're going to overthrow them peacefully if they don't.
[02:48:53.804 --> 02:48:54.684]  You got it, bingo.
[02:48:54.704 --> 02:48:55.685]  No more of that shit.
[02:48:55.745 --> 02:48:56.766]  That's the whole thing.
[02:48:58.837 --> 02:49:03.240]  People better appreciate the internet while they're still able to use it free and open, shouldn't they, Gerald?
[02:49:03.360 --> 02:49:06.922]  Yes, they should, and people better become active in any way they can.
[02:49:06.942 --> 02:49:08.903]  Speak up, stand out.
[02:49:09.223 --> 02:49:12.605]  You know, I have a vision of heaven and hell.
[02:49:13.485 --> 02:49:23.411]  To me, hell is taking those last breaths and knowing that you weren't the person who you said or claimed you thought you were.
[02:49:24.372 --> 02:49:27.954]  And people better die in dignity, because to me,
[02:49:28.991 --> 02:49:30.432]  It's hell if you don't.
[02:49:31.032 --> 02:49:34.013]  And now is the choice to live or die.
[02:49:36.453 --> 02:49:40.675]  To know that you are the person that you claim to be.
[02:49:41.235 --> 02:49:42.295]  Talk is cheap.
[02:49:42.835 --> 02:49:50.358]  It takes guts, it takes stamina and dignity and respect to be the person that you need to be.
[02:49:50.758 --> 02:49:56.760]  And people need to shape up physically, spiritually, emotionally.
[02:49:57.486 --> 02:50:00.248]  In order for this country to regain its greatness.
[02:50:00.928 --> 02:50:02.849]  And I've given the formula before.
[02:50:03.189 --> 02:50:05.370]  It's very simple and it's only a fact.
[02:50:05.751 --> 02:50:07.372]  We were the greatest nation on earth.
[02:50:07.952 --> 02:50:11.394]  When it wasn't about Wall Street, we had strong Main Street.
[02:50:11.914 --> 02:50:14.916]  It wasn't about Walmart, it was about mom and pop.
[02:50:15.236 --> 02:50:18.778]  And it wasn't about factory farms, it was family farms.
[02:50:19.098 --> 02:50:20.739]  We need to support each other.
[02:50:21.275 --> 02:50:22.876]  Absolutely, Gerald Cilente.
[02:50:22.916 --> 02:50:24.177]  The big challenge is here.
[02:50:24.678 --> 02:50:27.880]  The globalists have set up a scientific dictatorship and are moving against us.
[02:50:28.221 --> 02:50:30.342]  But thanks to you and many others, we've got a chance to stop it.
[02:50:30.703 --> 02:50:32.704]  Gerald Cilente, we'll talk to you again very soon.
[02:50:32.965 --> 02:50:34.286]  Hey, thanks for having me on.
[02:50:34.746 --> 02:50:36.147]  Glad you got out of Chile safe.
[02:50:36.247 --> 02:50:37.168]  Great job, crew.
[02:50:37.208 --> 02:50:40.250]  Retransmission, jam-packed with Wayne, Paul, and others.
[02:50:40.270 --> 02:50:40.991]  Coming up.

[02:50:49.264 --> 02:50:53.486]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:50:53.806 --> 02:50:57.868]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:50:58.148 --> 02:51:03.551]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:51:03.891 --> 02:51:09.193]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:51:09.514 --> 02:51:14.436]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
