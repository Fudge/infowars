[00:00:04.255 --> 00:00:08.418]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.098 --> 00:00:09.899]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:11.620]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.823]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.423 --> 00:00:20.486]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.114 --> 00:00:36.895]  Traficant is our guest.
[00:00:37.096 --> 00:00:38.036]  James Traficant.
[00:00:38.056 --> 00:00:39.758]  We're very honored to have him with us.
[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:50.666]  He, of course, ran in 1984 as a low-budget grassroots campaign for Congress despite being outspent 7-1 by an incumbent Republican.
[00:00:50.686 --> 00:00:53.368]  Traficant won handily by 18,000 votes.
[00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:55.270]  He'd been re-elected seven times.
[00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.171]  In 2002, they set him up.
[00:00:58.232 --> 00:01:02.156]  It's completely transparent, just like with the governor of Alabama.
[00:01:02.236 --> 00:01:03.217]  That's now admitted.
[00:01:03.237 --> 00:01:05.278]  They had to release him from prison.
[00:01:05.318 --> 00:01:07.761]  It came out it was a complete fraud setup.
[00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:11.003]  They threatened to put somebody in prison that worked for him and they didn't lie.
[00:01:11.464 --> 00:01:14.226]  Same thing with James Traficant.
[00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:15.948]  Mr. Traficant, great to have you here with us.
[00:01:16.108 --> 00:01:17.749]  Well, glad to be on your show, Alex.
[00:01:17.769 --> 00:01:18.730]  You've got a great show.
[00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.016]  I'm sorry I haven't been there so far, but you've really educated the American people, for sure.
[00:01:27.014 --> 00:01:33.357]  Well, you've been in solitary confinement and in the concentration camp, so you couldn't come on, but it's great to have you here.
[00:01:34.017 --> 00:01:39.159]  Sir, break down what really happened to you for some out there that may not know and why it's so important.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:54.226]  Well, I think what's amazing about the whole ordeal was it was a $15 million investigation over a span of six years, over 250 agents, all on or about the time that the Trade Center and the Pentagon were being attacked.
[00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.977]  The bottom line is the government, and this is the issue now, Alex, that will be coming to bear.
[00:02:00.997 --> 00:02:06.985]  The government admitted at trial, voluntarily, that they made no audio or videotapes on me in six years.
[00:02:07.906 --> 00:02:12.633]  And the reason they did that, it's evident, is because they had no evidence of any crimes whatsoever.
[00:02:13.382 --> 00:02:15.264]  They had no evidence, physical evidence.
[00:02:15.304 --> 00:02:18.266]  They had seven people who were pressured to lie.
[00:02:18.607 --> 00:02:22.029]  Three of them, four of them already recanted that they were pressured to lie.
[00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:33.519]  And there's a young man in Nigeria who submitted an affidavit to the Nigerian government that his life was ruined because he wouldn't perjure himself in the trafficking case against trafficking for the government.
[00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:35.401]  So this thing is going to blow up.
[00:02:35.461 --> 00:02:39.304]  I think before it's over I'm going to get some money out of this and they're going to pay dearly.
[00:02:39.364 --> 00:02:39.845]  I've had it.
[00:02:40.445 --> 00:02:45.230]  And I think everybody in Austin is familiar with the term, I've had it by now.
[00:02:47.693 --> 00:02:53.919]  Well, since you brought that subject up to me when we went to break, what's your bottom line on the attack on the IRS building?
[00:02:54.179 --> 00:03:01.406]  Well, you know, the IRS has become such an agency where they actually have testified, Alex, before Congress.
[00:03:02.227 --> 00:03:02.868]  That fear
[00:03:04.116 --> 00:03:09.240]  Fear is what produces compliance, voluntary compliance, by the American people.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.823]  And without fear, there can be no collection of taxes.
[00:03:13.883 --> 00:03:23.491]  Now, to me, this is an absolute oxymoron in a free republic to hear a statement like that coming from an institution such as the Internal Revenue Service.
[00:03:24.111 --> 00:03:27.954]  You know, my particular case is quite documented.
[00:03:28.434 --> 00:03:31.717]  I am the congressman that did change the burden of proof in a civil tax case.
[00:03:32.304 --> 00:03:36.730]  Before 1998, the taxpayer was guilty and had to prove himself innocent.
[00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.358]  I was able to change that in a 1998 tax bill with the help of a Texan by the name of Bill Archer.
[00:03:44.167 --> 00:03:55.876]  The chairman of the Republican Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Bill Archer put my language in in the conference committee because the IRS had threatened a veto by President Clinton if it had the Travagan language.
[00:03:55.896 --> 00:04:00.360]  So I want to give tremendous credit in the state of Texas to that little man.
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:06.084]  I think if George W. Bush would have made Bill Archer his Secretary of the Treasury, this country wouldn't be in the fix it's in.
[00:04:06.124 --> 00:04:06.925]  But having said that,
[00:04:07.817 --> 00:04:09.378]  Alex, the results were dramatic.
[00:04:09.438 --> 00:04:17.305]  They did a study one year before the bill and one year after, and all of the variables dealt basically with the traffic and burden of proof language.
[00:04:17.906 --> 00:04:19.707]  Wage garnishments dropped from $3.1 million to $560,000.
[00:04:19.747 --> 00:04:21.028]  Property liens dropped from $670,000 to $160,000.
[00:04:21.128 --> 00:04:24.371]  And individual family-owned homes seized by the IRS dropped from $10,070 to 57 homes, Alex.
[00:04:24.391 --> 00:04:24.691]  57 in 50 states.
[00:04:37.675 --> 00:04:39.577]  We've got an agency that's out of control.
[00:04:40.018 --> 00:04:44.162]  One of my last bills was in tandem with two Republicans.
[00:04:44.463 --> 00:04:48.166]  One from Louisiana, Billy Tozan, and one from Colorado.
[00:04:48.307 --> 00:04:50.469]  Congressman James Traficant, I hate to interrupt you.
[00:04:50.489 --> 00:04:51.590]  We've got to go to break, sir.
[00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.653]  I am going to skip the next break coming up, so we have more time.
[00:04:54.693 --> 00:04:57.296]  Continue from there after this quick break.
[00:04:57.316 --> 00:04:57.757]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.517 --> 00:05:06.359]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.460]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.721]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:05:10.821 --> 00:05:12.342]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:05:12.482 --> 00:05:16.863]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:05:16.943 --> 00:05:19.304]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[00:05:59.298 --> 00:06:03.520]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:03.841 --> 00:06:04.461]  Number one.
[00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:07.903]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:08.183 --> 00:06:08.743]  Number two.
[00:06:09.024 --> 00:06:13.586]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:13.926 --> 00:06:14.387]  It's true.
[00:06:14.667 --> 00:06:19.249]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:20.070]  Number three.
[00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.653]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:23.953 --> 00:06:27.676]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:27.856 --> 00:06:28.116]  Number 4.
[00:06:28.656 --> 00:06:31.018]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:34.821]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:35.101 --> 00:06:35.642]  Number 5.
[00:06:35.902 --> 00:06:39.825]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:40.045 --> 00:06:44.809]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:49.112]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:49.252 --> 00:06:50.833]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:51.033 --> 00:06:53.135]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[00:06:59.687 --> 00:07:02.308]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:07.671]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:09.772]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:07:10.072 --> 00:07:14.895]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:07:15.075 --> 00:07:16.035]  How much do you want?
[00:07:16.255 --> 00:07:17.016]  When do you want it?
[00:07:17.396 --> 00:07:18.997]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:07:19.277 --> 00:07:20.097]  When will you need it?
[00:07:20.337 --> 00:07:22.398]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:07:22.558 --> 00:07:23.659]  Will there be any food?
[00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:25.220]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:25.640]  If there's
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.801]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:07:27.942 --> 00:07:30.483]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:07:30.663 --> 00:07:33.886]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:07:34.266 --> 00:07:37.768]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:07:38.069 --> 00:07:39.069]  How much will you need?
[00:07:39.309 --> 00:07:39.930]  We don't know.
[00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:41.131]  How much do you want?
[00:07:41.311 --> 00:07:42.051]  All you can get.
[00:07:42.231 --> 00:07:42.632]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:07:43.332 --> 00:07:43.892]  I have studied
[00:08:13.516 --> 00:08:19.620]  Governor Siegelman's case, when it first happened, and he's been vindicated, it was a total setup.
[00:08:20.481 --> 00:08:23.523]  I have studied James Traficant's case.
[00:08:24.044 --> 00:08:25.505]  Absolutely set up.
[00:08:26.986 --> 00:08:34.231]  When they can persecute governors and congressmen, and put them in prison for no reason, and ruin them financially.
[00:08:36.445 --> 00:08:41.192]  When they can persecute a sitting governor or a sitting congressman, none of us are safe.
[00:08:41.212 --> 00:08:42.714]  Like they tortured Congressman Hansen.
[00:08:43.115 --> 00:08:44.256]  We, of course, came to his aid.
[00:08:46.019 --> 00:08:49.784]  They dieseled him until his feet exploded, driving him around for weeks, chained up.
[00:08:50.632 --> 00:08:53.133]  This is the type of Hanoi Hilton stuff that's going on.
[00:08:53.153 --> 00:09:02.859]  We're going to talk about what happened to Trafficant in prison, why he was persecuted, the IRS, what he thinks of the event in Austin, what he's told me off air if he wants to say that on air.
[00:09:03.379 --> 00:09:07.622]  Then we'll talk about who targeted him for persecution and why.
[00:09:08.593 --> 00:09:12.457]  And how he's going to be the comeback kid, and hopefully our listeners will support him.
[00:09:12.477 --> 00:09:13.377]  We're going to give you an address.
[00:09:13.638 --> 00:09:15.319]  He didn't ask for this, I did.
[00:09:15.579 --> 00:09:23.306]  I just got his address for people to send him, not campaign money, he's going to run again as an independent, but to get him back on his feet so he can.
[00:09:23.567 --> 00:09:27.870]  Because they've ruined him and sucked his treasure out of him so he can't defend himself.
[00:09:28.131 --> 00:09:33.215]  If this ever happens to me, and unfortunately there's a good chance it will, when I get out of prison I want people to support me.
[00:09:34.196 --> 00:09:34.617]  I'm ready.
[00:09:34.917 --> 00:09:35.918]  I understand what happens.
[00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:38.521]  Okay, going back to James Traficant.
[00:09:38.901 --> 00:09:44.748]  James, you got cut off of the break about how you were the number one true defender against the criminal IRS.
[00:09:44.768 --> 00:09:45.168]  Go ahead.
[00:09:45.769 --> 00:09:53.277]  Well, Alex, first I want to say is I know you said that maybe one day when you're off the air, maybe you might have similar type of problems, and I want to say this.
[00:09:54.699 --> 00:09:56.880]  Maybe one of the best compliments you'll ever get.
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:03.143]  I think you would have deserved that because you would have drawn the ire of a government that is completely out of control.
[00:10:03.544 --> 00:10:08.766]  And I believe your voice is becoming that strong that, quite frankly, I'm going to give you a little bit of advice now.
[00:10:08.846 --> 00:10:12.788]  Be very careful and watch yourself because you are having that kind of an effect.
[00:10:12.848 --> 00:10:18.011]  And when people start and begin to have an effect, if it's not singing to the choir, it's a real problem.
[00:10:18.611 --> 00:10:21.933]  But having said that, we were talking before about the Internal Revenue Service.
[00:10:22.734 --> 00:10:30.978]  You know, I'm like everybody else in the country, seeing the headline news and the fiasco and the tragedy that struck Austin.
[00:10:31.778 --> 00:10:36.800]  But you know, when you look at the Internal Revenue Service, they have evoked over the years fear.
[00:10:37.761 --> 00:10:38.821]  Fear and abuse.
[00:10:39.342 --> 00:10:47.025]  In fact, they've testified, Alex, before the Congress of the United States, that without fear, they wouldn't have their voluntary, quote-unquote, voluntary compliance.
[00:10:47.577 --> 00:10:48.477]  Well, let me tell you something.
[00:10:48.577 --> 00:10:54.139]  Fear has no place in the Constitution of the United States or in the fabric of American government.
[00:10:54.459 --> 00:10:55.599]  And we've got a real problem.
[00:10:56.259 --> 00:11:02.621]  Now, in 1998, I was the individual responsible for changing the burden of proof in the civil tax case.
[00:11:03.421 --> 00:11:08.702]  As I said earlier, I want to tip my hat to a Texan, Mr. Bill Archer.
[00:11:09.302 --> 00:11:12.943]  Mr. Bill Archer was the Republican Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
[00:11:13.815 --> 00:11:21.780]  And that the trafficking language was not in the bill, that reform bill, because the IRS had threatened a veto to President Clinton if it contained the trafficking language.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:33.927]  Well, after the bill passed the House, I got a call from Chairman Archer, and he said, you know, we have so much support for your bill, that he said he was going to put it into the conference committee between the House and the Senate, and he did.
[00:11:34.567 --> 00:11:41.071]  And I honestly believe this, and I want the people of Texas who are listening to hear this, that I believe if President Bush
[00:11:42.085 --> 00:11:46.509]  Would have named Bill Archer, his Secretary of Treasury of America, would not be in the fix with them today.
[00:11:47.149 --> 00:11:55.916]  Now having said that, what the Travagan bill basically said was this, up until 98, Alex, you had an agency that says, Alex, you owe us $50,000.
[00:11:56.156 --> 00:11:58.398]  And you say, my God, how could I owe you $50,000?
[00:11:58.998 --> 00:12:01.360]  And they say, well, prove you don't, Alex.
[00:12:01.861 --> 00:12:03.782]  The burden of proof you see was on the taxpayer.
[00:12:04.223 --> 00:12:05.764]  The Travagan language changed that.
[00:12:06.741 --> 00:12:16.509]  And in 98, when a bill passed, they did a study one year after the passage of the bill, Alex, and they compared one year before the passage to one year after the passage.
[00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:21.854]  And there were three salient points of concern that were covered by their study.
[00:12:22.274 --> 00:12:23.856]  The first one was wage garnishment.
[00:12:24.356 --> 00:12:30.201]  When the burden of proof was on the taxpayer, there were 3.1 million Americans whose wages were garnished.
[00:12:30.851 --> 00:12:35.972]  The following year, with the burden of proof on the Internal Revenue Service, that dropped to $561,000.
[00:12:36.052 --> 00:12:38.473]  Three million less, Alex.
[00:12:39.193 --> 00:12:41.214]  The second category was property liens.
[00:12:42.174 --> 00:12:47.696]  There were $670,000 the year before, $161,000 the year after.
[00:12:48.436 --> 00:12:53.317]  And the final category was individual family-owned homes that were seized, taken by the IRS.
[00:12:53.838 --> 00:12:57.198]  The year before, when the taxpayer had the burden of proof, it was $10,073.
[00:12:59.457 --> 00:13:02.079]  The year after, it was 57, Alex.
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.121]  One per state when they had to prove it.
[00:13:05.642 --> 00:13:12.867]  You see, one of the last measures that I had, and it really was upsetting, and Chairman Archer said he liked the bill.
[00:13:13.728 --> 00:13:26.037]  Well, I teamed up with two Republicans, Billy Tozan of Louisiana and Dan Schaefer of Colorado, and it was the flat tax, the fair tax, a straight consumption tax.
[00:13:27.023 --> 00:13:28.064]  And let me tell you something.
[00:13:28.284 --> 00:13:32.486]  It repeals the 16th Amendment and throws out the IRS.
[00:13:32.926 --> 00:13:43.992]  It abolishes all withholding, all debt taxes, all capital gains taxes, corporate taxes, individual tax on expenses for education, investment tax.
[00:13:45.023 --> 00:13:46.304]  And it's about time, Alex.
[00:13:46.764 --> 00:13:55.131]  And what everybody's saying, well, you're going to put a 25% consumption tax on us trafficking, and you're going to bankrupt everybody with these cost increases.
[00:13:55.571 --> 00:13:57.773]  Listen to this study that was performed in Harvard.
[00:13:58.193 --> 00:14:07.440]  They said when you throw out this burdensome tax code that has destroyed companies and destroyed our competitiveness, they said they will have downward movement to gain market share.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.442]  Sounds like capitalism all over again.
[00:14:09.802 --> 00:14:13.605]  And they predict that the prices would hardly raise, if at all.
[00:14:14.548 --> 00:14:22.414]  And you'll have Social Security fully funded, Medicare fully funded, and you'll have the same neutral, if not more, revenue stream than we have now.
[00:14:22.454 --> 00:14:26.937]  But the bottom line is, you see Alex, it's time to reward work.
[00:14:26.997 --> 00:14:32.822]  Our tax code is basically a progressive communist tax code that was founded by Karl Marx.
[00:14:33.442 --> 00:14:34.383]  And here's how it works.
[00:14:34.663 --> 00:14:36.104]  The harder you work, the more you pay.
[00:14:37.025 --> 00:14:38.466]  The harder you work, you get hit over the head.
[00:14:39.375 --> 00:14:41.278]  We subsidize illegitimacy.
[00:14:41.638 --> 00:14:43.201]  We reward dependency.
[00:14:43.501 --> 00:14:44.543]  We kill investment.
[00:14:44.783 --> 00:14:46.265]  We chase companies overseas.
[00:14:46.586 --> 00:14:50.151]  These companies, they say they're not patriots because they left America.
[00:14:50.191 --> 00:14:54.357]  The reason they left is the tax code has made it impossible to make a profit in America.
[00:14:54.887 --> 00:14:55.768]  We've got to change it.
[00:14:56.268 --> 00:14:56.769]  Scrap it.
[00:14:56.809 --> 00:14:58.570]  Throw the Internal Revenue Service out.
[00:14:58.650 --> 00:14:59.831]  Abolish the withholding.
[00:15:00.092 --> 00:15:00.832]  Absolutely.
[00:15:01.373 --> 00:15:02.794]  And that's where we've got to go, Alex.
[00:15:03.054 --> 00:15:06.297]  And let me say this briefly about this man in Texas.
[00:15:06.597 --> 00:15:08.879]  From what I understand, he was not a wacko.
[00:15:08.919 --> 00:15:09.780]  He had it.
[00:15:10.788 --> 00:15:16.371]  And there's so many people that have it, and it's not unusual to see him venting at the Internal Revenue Service.
[00:15:16.431 --> 00:15:27.917]  My God, Congress of the United States is derelict in their duties to not repeal the 16th Amendment, throw out individual personal tax, reward a man for his labor, not punish him.
[00:15:28.198 --> 00:15:29.398]  And that's where we gotta go, Alex.
[00:15:29.478 --> 00:15:30.719]  That's exactly where we gotta go.
[00:15:31.104 --> 00:15:44.594]  Well, look at Geithner, and most of the White House don't pay their taxes, but then the news is saying, look at this tax cheat, Joe Stack, he's scum, but then the big boys, they don't even have to pay the tax.
[00:15:45.054 --> 00:15:46.175]  Well, this is one of the problems.
[00:15:46.215 --> 00:15:48.117]  You have selective enforcement in all areas.
[00:15:48.617 --> 00:15:52.380]  First of all, we need a whole address to our central government.
[00:15:53.007 --> 00:15:58.210]  This is the United States of America, not the central government of America.
[00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:02.072]  And states, quite frankly, Alex, have become background music in a doctor's office.
[00:16:02.733 --> 00:16:11.758]  And I think one of the biggest mistakes ever made was the amendment to the Constitution that provided for popular votes for the U.S.
[00:16:11.778 --> 00:16:12.078]  Senate.
[00:16:12.739 --> 00:16:16.681]  I know this might sound different off the beat, but I just want- No, we need the 17th Amendment back.
[00:16:17.061 --> 00:16:17.922]  Here's what I'm saying.
[00:16:18.062 --> 00:16:18.642]  We need to get rid of it.
[00:16:20.649 --> 00:16:21.709]  Those two U.S.
[00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:25.210]  Senators were beholding to the state legislature in their respective states.
[00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.831]  If they didn't do what the states wanted, they replaced them.
[00:16:28.251 --> 00:16:31.592]  Now you've got these Senators that are basically Senators for America.
[00:16:32.712 --> 00:16:34.033]  We've lost states' rights.
[00:16:34.353 --> 00:16:35.273]  We've taken away.
[00:16:35.533 --> 00:16:39.054]  We've developed this big, central, powerful government that has molded us.
[00:16:39.374 --> 00:16:44.196]  My God, we've got a tax code that has become a behavior modification for economic activity.
[00:16:44.476 --> 00:16:45.516]  This is crazy, Alex.
[00:16:45.876 --> 00:16:47.616]  And I think it's not rocket science.
[00:16:47.676 --> 00:16:49.257]  There can be tremendous changes here.
[00:16:50.094 --> 00:16:53.260]  And it's not change that's needed, it's replacement.
[00:16:53.841 --> 00:17:03.797]  And I think, and I will make this statement on your show, if the United States does not throw out the progressive income tax and replace it with a fair tax,
[00:17:04.588 --> 00:17:07.752]  America will implode similar to the Soviet Union.
[00:17:08.153 --> 00:17:11.717]  It's just a matter of time with that debt approaching $14 trillion.
[00:17:12.098 --> 00:17:13.279]  We can't satisfy.
[00:17:13.499 --> 00:17:16.623]  We're nothing more than a managed debt economy nation.
[00:17:21.129 --> 00:17:26.611]  This is powerful information, but I also want to get into your persecution, why you were persecuted, who was behind it.
[00:17:26.691 --> 00:17:27.931]  Was it the Israeli lobby?
[00:17:27.991 --> 00:17:28.971]  Was it the IRS?
[00:17:29.291 --> 00:17:30.252]  Was it a combination?
[00:17:30.272 --> 00:17:35.713]  We're going to break that down, and how if you can be persecuted like a heretic, this can happen to anybody.
[00:17:35.773 --> 00:17:44.696]  But finishing up with the whole income tax, they're raising all these other state taxes, local taxes, federal taxes, everything's starting to go bankrupt.
[00:17:45.416 --> 00:17:47.977]  Foreign banks are openly looting us.
[00:17:49.457 --> 00:17:58.820]  Paul Sengen can give $200 million of bailout money to himself and give himself a waiver, and then nobody even knows why James Traficant went to jail.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.260]  Completely made up.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.821]  Same thing with Governor in Alabama.
[00:18:03.181 --> 00:18:04.341]  I mean, this is amazing.
[00:18:04.401 --> 00:18:14.624]  But specifically, looking at this, how long do you think America has till it completely collapses if this out of control government continues?
[00:18:15.324 --> 00:18:16.645]  I think, I would say this.
[00:18:17.572 --> 00:18:21.717]  I would say we... I can't predict the exact time, but I will say this.
[00:18:22.177 --> 00:18:35.312]  I think it is inevitable, and I think it will be within the next generation, the next 20 to 25 years, where America will implode, and certain states will move towards saving their own revenue and moving off on their own, maybe a compacted state.
[00:18:35.912 --> 00:18:44.275]  I could see a state like Alaska with their own revenue stream bigger than most of the countries in landmass over in Europe saying, hey, we're on our own, guys.
[00:18:44.775 --> 00:18:46.716]  And I could see this starting to happen.
[00:18:46.736 --> 00:18:53.558]  I think Georgia legislature has advanced an initiative stating that they'll collect the federal tax, but they won't send it to Washington.
[00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:54.458]  Yes, sir.
[00:18:54.478 --> 00:18:56.939]  Let me just add, Congressman Traavikant, that
[00:18:58.055 --> 00:19:02.258]  That 30-plus states are moving to declare 9th and 10th Amendment powers, as you know.
[00:19:03.199 --> 00:19:07.342]  And the federal government itself has been hijacked by offshore banks.
[00:19:07.382 --> 00:19:10.764]  And I think it's going to happen a lot sooner than just 20 years.
[00:19:10.824 --> 00:19:15.267]  And so, NORTHCOM and Homeland Security, we got their internal Homeland Security documents a year ago.
[00:19:15.307 --> 00:19:16.008]  We broke this.
[00:19:16.248 --> 00:19:17.389]  We got it from law enforcement.
[00:19:17.609 --> 00:19:20.831]  Where Homeland Security internally, they train the police.
[00:19:21.111 --> 00:19:23.453]  This is really to suppress the American people.
[00:19:23.493 --> 00:19:25.795]  This is not about fighting Arabs in caves.
[00:19:26.075 --> 00:19:28.216]  No doubt.
[00:19:28.697 --> 00:19:40.204]  I think the headline that all Americans may expect, I hope it doesn't happen, but God forbid it does, is they'll wake up one morning and they'll hear a conversation on your show, Alex, about the dollar crashing.
[00:19:40.902 --> 00:19:51.345]  And when that dollar crashes, you will see an implosion in America, you'll see civil uprisings, you will see a massive hemorrhage of the institutions of the United States of America.
[00:19:51.365 --> 00:19:53.425]  See, nobody believes this can happen.
[00:19:53.905 --> 00:19:56.506]  Everybody believes this is America, this is not going to happen.
[00:19:56.846 --> 00:20:04.268]  What people are failing to see is a tremendous problem with the federal government not basically meeting the needs of the American people.
[00:20:04.648 --> 00:20:08.329]  And having said that, you asked me earlier, you know, what really happened to me?
[00:20:08.979 --> 00:20:16.022]  You know, in 1983, I was the only American in history to defeat the Justice Department in a RICO trial, pro se, without being an attorney.
[00:20:16.543 --> 00:20:17.783]  I was targeted ever since.
[00:20:19.084 --> 00:20:26.287]  In the late 80s, I was instrumental in bringing back John Demonik from Israel, who was on trial.
[00:20:26.587 --> 00:20:28.908]  He was already convicted and sentenced to be executed.
[00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:30.689]  No one would look into this man's case.
[00:20:30.869 --> 00:20:31.850]  I looked into his case.
[00:20:32.469 --> 00:20:42.073]  And I discovered, and I was able to get documents from the Justice Department that not only prove he was innocent, Alex, but who Ivan the Terrible really was.
[00:20:43.313 --> 00:20:56.158]  It was so blatant in America, the pressure that Israel, through their lobby, had put on me and put on our government, that Congress wouldn't hold a hearing on my evidence, and the Sixth Circuit Court in Cincinnati wouldn't accept the trafficking evidence.
[00:20:56.658 --> 00:20:58.579]  I sent it over to the Israeli Supreme Court.
[00:20:59.219 --> 00:21:03.302]  I did a live interview with Brian Gumbel on today's show by satellite from Jerusalem.
[00:21:03.682 --> 00:21:06.565]  And I basically said, they put this innocent man to death.
[00:21:06.745 --> 00:21:11.248]  Israel's going to lose upwards of $20 billion a year from the American taxpayers.
[00:21:11.568 --> 00:21:13.430]  And Brian Gumbel jumped in, he says, well, what do you mean?
[00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:14.811]  They only get $3 billion.
[00:21:14.871 --> 00:21:16.372]  I said, Brian, that's only foreign aid.
[00:21:17.088 --> 00:21:22.129]  No one's looking at loans, loans converted to grants, grants, economic assistance, military assistance.
[00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:30.692]  And I am telling you that the American taxpayer is shipping over $25,000 for every man, woman, and child in Israel every year.
[00:21:30.712 --> 00:21:38.013]  Well, I got a call the following night from the Supreme Court of Israel, and they said he'll be in Tel Aviv tomorrow night, take him home.
[00:21:38.534 --> 00:21:39.894]  Here's the man on death row, Alex.
[00:21:40.643 --> 00:21:44.166]  But when that happened, I had a bullseye on my back like you couldn't believe.
[00:21:44.546 --> 00:21:50.351]  I had the IRS and the Justice Department already after me, and I had the most powerful lobby in America.
[00:21:50.691 --> 00:21:54.374]  A lobby that controls much of the foreign policy of the United States.
[00:21:54.434 --> 00:21:58.537]  Now, I'm being branded a bigot and anti-Semite for saying it, but let me tell you something.
[00:21:59.065 --> 00:22:04.869]  There's only one entity that should control the Congress of the United States, and that's the American people.
[00:22:05.249 --> 00:22:10.192]  And people won't even whisper the truth about what's going on behind the scenes in Washington.
[00:22:10.512 --> 00:22:12.113]  The country's in a free fall, Alex.
[00:22:12.413 --> 00:22:12.934]  We're in trouble.
[00:22:13.854 --> 00:22:18.118]  Well I want to continue down this line because you had never been an enemy of Israel.
[00:22:18.578 --> 00:22:27.065]  You simply defended an innocent man and even the Supreme Court looked at the evidence and let him go and now they've grabbed him again and hauled him away.
[00:22:27.085 --> 00:22:31.108]  I mean it's just a complete and total witch hunt.
[00:22:32.069 --> 00:22:39.612]  And now you have all these top professors coming out and pointing out that the Israeli lobby and Israeli newspapers brag that they control a lot of Congress.
[00:22:40.333 --> 00:22:47.476]  And you have Rahm Emanuel in the White House, who's an Israeli government agent, was in their military in the Gulf War.
[00:22:47.496 --> 00:22:52.218]  I mean, you're only saying what much of the evidence shows.
[00:22:53.178 --> 00:23:04.882]  And I've always read, and experts of history have shown, that when you do beat the Justice Department, and they win, what, over 90% of their cases, they always come back, back, back, back, back, back.
[00:23:05.223 --> 00:23:13.846]  So was it the IRS that you exposed that got them first coming after you, and then the icing on the cake was then getting that innocent man freed?
[00:23:14.713 --> 00:23:17.676]  I think it was a combination of all three, but just remember this.
[00:23:18.396 --> 00:23:24.862]  I was one of the most bitter enemies of the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service, and there's no kidding about that.
[00:23:25.262 --> 00:23:29.046]  And I had a struggle that took me 12 years, and let me say this, I've been a Democrat all my life.
[00:23:29.546 --> 00:23:36.132]  The Democrats, I almost had a fistfight with Chairman Rosenkowski, wouldn't even hold a hearing on my burden of proof legislation.
[00:23:36.813 --> 00:23:40.556]  When Republicans did come in, and I'll give credit to Bill Archer again.
[00:23:41.266 --> 00:23:45.209]  There's a man that looked at the American taxpayer and he did something very significant.
[00:23:45.509 --> 00:23:47.411]  And I want to thank him on behalf of all Americans.
[00:23:47.451 --> 00:23:48.952]  I don't even know what happened to the old chairman.
[00:23:49.333 --> 00:23:51.374]  I hope he's still alive down there in Texas.
[00:23:51.394 --> 00:23:52.135]  He's a great man.
[00:23:52.697 --> 00:23:57.659]  But Alex, I had a bullseye put on my back, but quite frankly, Scarlett, I don't give a damn.
[00:23:58.180 --> 00:23:59.280]  And here's the bottom line.
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:04.563]  If you're afraid to speak out about your own country, what has happened to our Constitution and our Bill of Rights?
[00:24:05.123 --> 00:24:07.584]  Why is everybody afraid to whisper what's going on?
[00:24:07.984 --> 00:24:13.087]  Listen to the strong statement I use on your show, even though it has labeled me and hurt me politically.
[00:24:13.687 --> 00:24:16.709]  Israel has a stranglehold on the United States of America.
[00:24:17.009 --> 00:24:19.451]  They have us in foreign wars we shouldn't be involved with.
[00:24:19.711 --> 00:24:20.852]  They have bankrupted us.
[00:24:21.292 --> 00:24:30.718]  And they've gone so far as having Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon making a statement on Israeli radio, October 3, 2001, the following.
[00:24:31.238 --> 00:24:34.860]  We, comma, the Jewish people, comma, control America.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.381]  And the Americans know it.
[00:24:36.861 --> 00:24:39.303]  And no one read that in a newspaper in this country.
[00:24:39.883 --> 00:24:40.964]  No one knows about it.
[00:24:41.761 --> 00:24:43.622]  So maybe Jim Trafficant is going to be labeled.
[00:24:43.982 --> 00:24:47.124]  But I think if we've got a problem, let's straighten our country out.
[00:24:47.164 --> 00:24:48.405]  We don't have to hurt Israel.
[00:24:48.866 --> 00:24:49.646]  They are a friend.
[00:24:49.666 --> 00:24:53.268]  They're a democracy within a cluster of monarchs and dictators.
[00:24:53.549 --> 00:24:56.130]  But we don't have to prosecute their expansion plans.
[00:24:56.410 --> 00:25:00.813]  We don't have to get involved and be pushed into wars by Israel, manipulated by Israel.
[00:25:01.053 --> 00:25:03.535]  And we shouldn't answer to nobody but the American people.
[00:25:04.653 --> 00:25:05.914]  Well, look at Ron Paul.
[00:25:06.254 --> 00:25:08.496]  I mean, he says cut off foreign aid to everybody.
[00:25:08.536 --> 00:25:16.463]  We are going bankrupt, and they call him an anti-Semite, though he wants to cut it off to Africa, he wants to cut it off to Egypt, he wants to cut it off to Iraq.
[00:25:16.583 --> 00:25:19.986]  We can't pay this bill anymore.
[00:25:20.707 --> 00:25:29.355]  And the fact that whenever somebody says, look, we need to stop being involved in all these wars, we need to stop doing this, and the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center
[00:25:30.376 --> 00:25:41.723]  Come out and attack me when I am mild on this because I'm just trying to bring everybody together to audit the Fed, to get the Federal Reserve out of here, to get the 17th Amendment overturned, to get rid of the income tax.
[00:25:42.064 --> 00:25:46.847]  There's no doubt you get savaged when you even mildly criticize.
[00:25:46.887 --> 00:25:49.468]  So I can't imagine what it's been like for you.
[00:25:49.508 --> 00:25:51.670]  Let's briefly, because we're going to break here in about four minutes.
[00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:56.672]  Talk about what happened to you in prison, because, I mean, you're a tough guy.
[00:25:56.692 --> 00:26:00.954]  You're not whining about it on air now, but they treated you like hell, I saw on the news.
[00:26:01.174 --> 00:26:04.596]  Alex, the first place I went was 50% illegal immigrants.
[00:26:05.116 --> 00:26:07.778]  And keep this in mind, for the people of Texas specifically.
[00:26:08.318 --> 00:26:14.441]  Jim Travigan was a congressman who passed on the House floor, utilizing our soldiers on our border.
[00:26:15.402 --> 00:26:24.689]  You know, regarding the borders in the Mideast, regarding the borders all over the world, our troops are going for lunch over in Italy and going for the theater in Germany, and our borders are wide open.
[00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:29.332]  See, I'm very- I was labeled a bigot because here's my position on immigration, Alex.
[00:26:29.853 --> 00:26:31.534]  Number one, let's put our troops on the border.
[00:26:31.554 --> 00:26:33.015]  It's a national security check line.
[00:26:33.275 --> 00:26:35.817]  And if you're in America illegally, you should be thrown the hell out.
[00:26:36.137 --> 00:26:40.260]  Not given healthcare and given a false- Well, that's what Mexico does to us!
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:43.202]  Mexico treats American citizens like trash and shakes them down!
[00:26:43.422 --> 00:26:44.163]  Hey, listen.
[00:26:44.623 --> 00:26:45.564]  Here's the way I feel.
[00:26:45.624 --> 00:26:48.726]  If you're an American citizen, I don't care what ethnic group you are, you're one of us.
[00:26:49.146 --> 00:26:51.588]  But if you're not, you've got to be thrown the hell out of here now.
[00:26:52.028 --> 00:26:56.171]  Both these parties are catering to a growing minority Hispanic vote.
[00:26:56.411 --> 00:26:57.672]  It's getting larger in America.
[00:26:57.712 --> 00:26:59.113]  It is larger than the black vote.
[00:26:59.453 --> 00:27:01.894]  And both these parties are giving them everything they want.
[00:27:02.295 --> 00:27:04.576]  Meanwhile, you've got a healthcare system out of control.
[00:27:04.836 --> 00:27:13.182]  You've got approximately 15 million, truth be known, illegal immigrants consuming welfare and different programs in this country with falsified documents.
[00:27:13.722 --> 00:27:15.664]  And neither party is dealing with it.
[00:27:15.724 --> 00:27:16.864]  Congressman, let me stop you.
[00:27:16.944 --> 00:27:19.666]  I got a guy that worked at Austin Energy here, and I already knew this.
[00:27:20.047 --> 00:27:21.628]  It's 800 plus sanctuary cities.
[00:27:22.088 --> 00:27:24.490]  But the illegals get a fake consular matricula.
[00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:32.015]  They pay a $200 down payment, or $250 depending on the size of the contract, to get their power and light turned on.
[00:27:32.275 --> 00:27:34.877]  Then they never pay the bill, he said, over 90% of the time.
[00:27:35.297 --> 00:27:38.360]  And then a new matricula comes up in six months when they turn the power off.
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:42.483]  And they were told in Austin Energy meetings, let them not pay.
[00:27:43.263 --> 00:27:44.584]  And it's the same thing.
[00:27:44.944 --> 00:27:46.445]  Drunk drivers, they get let go.
[00:27:46.826 --> 00:27:49.287]  Everything, but citizens are scum and trash.
[00:27:49.768 --> 00:27:52.690]  And so the average illegal is on three or four different welfare lines.
[00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:58.314]  Alex, it's so out of hand that it's a joke and it takes me to the National Health Care Bill.
[00:27:58.774 --> 00:28:03.777]  My God, America needs a health care bill, but there's deserving people who need some assistance.
[00:28:04.038 --> 00:28:08.981]  But you've got about 15 million illegal immigrants who are going to be involved in this thing and the American people are bankrupted.
[00:28:09.221 --> 00:28:11.563]  We've already destroyed companies and thrown them out.
[00:28:12.464 --> 00:28:25.015]  I don't think there's any common sense right now in Washington that I think Washington is manipulated and Washington is obstructed by outside forces and being very much manipulated.
[00:28:25.475 --> 00:28:27.497]  But having said that, let me get back to the prison.
[00:28:27.537 --> 00:28:32.942]  The first place I went to, Alex, I met 50% of illegal immigrants and they knew that I was the guy that said throw them the hell out.
[00:28:33.442 --> 00:28:34.704]  I slept with one eye open.
[00:28:35.024 --> 00:28:35.805]  The next thing you know...
[00:28:36.545 --> 00:28:40.428]  I'm at a medium high, which was known as a gladiator school up in Raybrook.
[00:28:40.468 --> 00:28:42.489]  People getting cut and hurt every particular day.
[00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:47.753]  There was a counselor in the system, I won't say where, that told me when I first went in.
[00:28:47.813 --> 00:28:50.235]  He said, listen, my mother's your biggest fan.
[00:28:50.595 --> 00:28:51.976]  Be careful, they want you to get hurt.
[00:28:52.557 --> 00:28:58.401]  The next thing you know, I'm at a medium high, and the truth be known, one more little infraction, I'd be in a penitentiary.
[00:28:59.181 --> 00:29:00.062]  A penitentiary!
[00:29:00.863 --> 00:29:05.386]  And the reason I end up in Rochester is they told me that I had a corkscrew aorta.
[00:29:06.664 --> 00:29:10.887]  And they told me I had his Corkscrew Ray order and I would not take medication, Alex, because I didn't trust them.
[00:29:12.008 --> 00:29:17.492]  And I end up in Rochester, and then they said I didn't have a Corkscrew Ray order.
[00:29:18.273 --> 00:29:19.274]  Let me tell you something.
[00:29:19.454 --> 00:29:24.318]  I believe that our government was hoping I would have died in prison and would not have come out.
[00:29:25.126 --> 00:29:27.968]  Okay, Congressman, Congressman, we gotta break.
[00:29:28.008 --> 00:29:42.358]  Come back right there and continue with the saga of your years of imprisonment and we will continue breaking down why you were persecuted and now your comeback kid status.
[00:29:42.578 --> 00:29:49.743]  We want today to get people to support you, get you back on your feet and launch as an independent because you certainly are a maverick.
[00:29:50.063 --> 00:29:50.983]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.464 --> 00:29:52.965]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.964 --> 00:29:56.663]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.244 --> 00:30:06.086]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:30:06.227 --> 00:30:08.167]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:30:08.307 --> 00:30:10.428]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:30:10.548 --> 00:30:12.069]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:30:12.209 --> 00:30:16.530]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:19.051]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[00:30:19.251 --> 00:30:23.873]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:30:23.973 --> 00:30:29.975]  For your home or business, their best seller, the Ecola Blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[00:30:30.035 --> 00:30:32.776]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[00:30:32.876 --> 00:30:35.497]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[00:30:35.597 --> 00:30:42.760]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:46.781]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling Ecola Blue at 1-800-691-6043.
[00:30:46.801 --> 00:30:47.001]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:30:52.763 --> 00:31:03.193]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:03.513 --> 00:31:07.577]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:07.837 --> 00:31:08.318]  Number two,
[00:31:08.678 --> 00:31:13.260]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:14.040]  It's true.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:18.901]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:19.202 --> 00:31:19.762]  Number three.
[00:31:20.022 --> 00:31:23.323]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:23.603 --> 00:31:27.344]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:27.524 --> 00:31:28.085]  Number four.
[00:31:28.325 --> 00:31:30.705]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:31.086 --> 00:31:34.487]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:34.767 --> 00:31:35.287]  Number five.
[00:31:35.547 --> 00:31:39.470]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:44.454]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:44.734 --> 00:31:48.777]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:48.917 --> 00:31:50.478]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:32:00.575 --> 00:32:04.196]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:04.536 --> 00:32:12.658]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:32:13.399 --> 00:32:17.440]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:28.843]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:32:29.483 --> 00:32:38.485]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless cloyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:38.985 --> 00:32:44.026]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:32:44.427 --> 00:32:51.608]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:51.908 --> 00:32:54.649]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:33:06.474 --> 00:33:08.475]  Ladies and gentlemen, get your pens and papers ready.
[00:33:08.495 --> 00:33:13.978]  I'm going to give you James Traficant's address if you want to support him.
[00:33:13.998 --> 00:33:21.021]  He's completely penniless after seven and a half years in prison, solitary confinement, you name it.
[00:33:21.222 --> 00:33:29.706]  Before we go back to him, we support the patriots out there and we also need your support as this platform to try to get everybody's voices heard and out there.
[00:33:30.206 --> 00:33:32.787]  We sell a lot of great books and videos at InfoWars.com.
[00:33:34.346 --> 00:33:39.170]  This right now is our bestseller, Shadow Government, exposing the whole global police state grid they're putting in.
[00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:41.372]  We have this discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:33:41.772 --> 00:33:42.933]  Jesse Ventura's new book.
[00:33:43.514 --> 00:33:48.678]  You get it discounted and a free video, free documentary film of your choice at InfoWars.com.
[00:33:48.718 --> 00:33:49.819]  Nobody else is offering this.
[00:33:49.859 --> 00:33:53.002]  Jesse Ventura, American Conspiracies, new book.
[00:33:54.002 --> 00:33:57.125]  If you want to support Mr. Trafficant so he can get back on his feet and then
[00:34:23.092 --> 00:34:26.414]  Get justice and go after the criminals that put him in prison.
[00:34:26.995 --> 00:34:29.456]  But that's how they bankrupt you so you can't defend yourself.
[00:34:30.057 --> 00:34:34.440]  It's 429, 429 North Main Street.
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:35.440]  429 North Main Street.
[00:34:36.421 --> 00:34:37.962]  And that's Poland, like the country.
[00:34:37.982 --> 00:34:39.863]  429 North Main Street.
[00:34:40.243 --> 00:34:41.925]  Poland, Ohio.
[00:34:43.166 --> 00:34:44.947]  44514.
[00:34:43.186 --> 00:34:44.947]  So, here's the address again.
[00:34:44.967 --> 00:34:46.288]  429 North Main Street, Poland, Ohio. 44514.
[00:34:53.979 --> 00:34:55.060]  And I've studied his case.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:58.423]  I've also studied Governor Don Siegelman's case.
[00:34:58.943 --> 00:35:01.906]  And back at the time when they railroaded him, we looked at him and said, this is completely staged.
[00:35:01.926 --> 00:35:03.427]  Turned out, U.S.
[00:35:03.467 --> 00:35:05.749]  prosecutors that work for Karl Rove, he ordered it.
[00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:07.431]  They've testified to this now.
[00:35:08.011 --> 00:35:08.452]  Get him.
[00:35:08.952 --> 00:35:09.933]  They kept coming after him.
[00:35:10.013 --> 00:35:11.454]  Investigation after investigation.
[00:35:11.554 --> 00:35:12.115]  All made up.
[00:35:12.475 --> 00:35:12.916]  Lying.
[00:35:14.707 --> 00:35:20.570]  Threatened to indict one of his employees for something totally separate outside the Capitol and said, lie about him, we won't send you to prison.
[00:35:21.231 --> 00:35:24.953]  Basically, same thing happened to Mr. Traficant, Don Siegelman.
[00:35:24.993 --> 00:35:28.295]  Now, he got out after nine months and has been vindicated and has admitted it was a fraud.
[00:35:28.755 --> 00:35:31.496]  He was going to serve a decade, not with Traficant.
[00:35:31.736 --> 00:35:37.820]  He was there seven and a half years and they told him, and he'll talk about this in a moment, anytime you say you're guilty, we'll let you go.
[00:35:38.874 --> 00:35:42.195]  Now, so first they try to pull some medical scams on him.
[00:35:42.655 --> 00:35:44.496]  They put him in with the illegal aliens.
[00:35:45.236 --> 00:35:47.017]  They put him into gladiator school.
[00:35:47.677 --> 00:35:49.838]  Medium, maximum security, high security.
[00:35:50.118 --> 00:35:53.259]  Continue, Congressman Traficant, with what happened to you in prison.
[00:35:53.999 --> 00:35:59.261]  Well, at some particular point, you know, you made the statement that you have to stand on your own two feet.
[00:35:59.281 --> 00:36:01.162]  You have to be prepared for almost anything.
[00:36:01.844 --> 00:36:12.092]  And I had an awful lot of enemies in the prison system, and I didn't know exactly who or how someone might come at you, so you sleep with one eye open, Alex.
[00:36:12.512 --> 00:36:19.017]  But the bottom line was that I not only did that, I developed what I considered to be a firm resolve.
[00:36:19.077 --> 00:36:23.520]  And one thing Nelson Mandela said, you never really know a country unless you go through their prison system.
[00:36:24.122 --> 00:36:26.263]  And that's one thing he was exactly right about.
[00:36:26.303 --> 00:36:28.565]  You see the other side of the United States of America.
[00:36:28.925 --> 00:36:30.406]  We've got such crippling problems.
[00:36:30.886 --> 00:36:31.746]  But I survived.
[00:36:32.447 --> 00:36:33.807]  I was not afraid to survive.
[00:36:34.328 --> 00:36:39.791]  I told them where they could shove that pardon, because I certainly wasn't going to admit to something that I didn't do.
[00:36:40.351 --> 00:36:52.578]  But very few people know is that before that trial, the Northern District Court, federal court system of Ohio, passed a rule that if you got a judge from a particular area, you got a jury from that area.
[00:36:53.198 --> 00:36:53.879]  I don't know.
[00:37:12.333 --> 00:37:17.237]  No one was charged for perjury, but she did not allow them to testify to the jury.
[00:37:17.757 --> 00:37:34.631]  And four of those people said that of the seven people who testified against me, they had admitted to somebody close or whomever who had confided in me that they lied so they wouldn't go to prison themselves or have their wife indicted or their kids indicted or their company taken away, etc., etc.
[00:37:35.452 --> 00:37:36.354]  Four of the seven.
[00:37:36.594 --> 00:37:38.177]  She didn't allow it to go to the jury.
[00:37:38.518 --> 00:37:43.228]  Now we find out after the trial was over, one of the key witnesses against me, who was
[00:37:43.814 --> 00:37:53.196]  He perjured himself in my trial because he was caught perjuring himself in a previous trial that the judge's husband had a relationship, business-wise, with that family.
[00:37:53.696 --> 00:37:57.756]  I mean, this thing, it was so abusive that it speaks out.
[00:37:57.796 --> 00:38:06.458]  But when you're the number one target of the Justice Department, the number one target of the American-Israeli Public Affairs Committee, Alex, you have nowhere to turn.
[00:38:06.838 --> 00:38:12.599]  You've got to stand on your own two feet and hopefully outlive it and come back and try and do what you can about it.
[00:38:12.884 --> 00:38:14.745]  Now, Congressman, let's break this down, though.
[00:38:15.725 --> 00:38:20.788]  The type of threats you got when you were in Congress, and how you got set up.
[00:38:21.348 --> 00:38:32.213]  There's this crisis of confidence now, because police all over the country, in every major city of Texas, just as an example, have been caught planting drugs on people to take their property.
[00:38:32.993 --> 00:38:34.314]  It's now standard procedure.
[00:38:34.354 --> 00:38:36.895]  They admit, they have informants lie on the stand.
[00:38:37.475 --> 00:38:39.336]  About political enemies they have.
[00:38:39.857 --> 00:38:45.300]  I mean, they can put anybody they want in prison, but the public now knows it's a fraud.
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:46.320]  It's like the death penalty.
[00:38:46.681 --> 00:38:48.862]  I'm for the death penalty at a grassroots level.
[00:38:49.202 --> 00:38:55.406]  If they catch somebody who's murdered a kid, the problem is more than a third of those on death row has been proven with DNA or totally innocent.
[00:38:55.766 --> 00:39:01.509]  We know that the system is so corrupt, you can't trust anything they say or do.
[00:39:01.569 --> 00:39:04.071]  So, but briefly, because I remember seeing it in the news.
[00:39:04.851 --> 00:39:06.252]  Well, you're under constant threat.
[00:39:06.272 --> 00:39:08.254]  With me, I did months and months after end in the hole in isolation.
[00:39:24.019 --> 00:39:26.001]  Because they said my attitude.
[00:39:26.421 --> 00:39:28.122]  But basically they were trying to break me.
[00:39:28.483 --> 00:39:30.544]  And I survived all that time in prison.
[00:39:31.005 --> 00:39:33.607]  I never even acknowledged the presence of any of the wardens.
[00:39:33.667 --> 00:39:34.728]  I couldn't tell you their names.
[00:39:35.308 --> 00:39:36.629]  I just kept them... Hold on a minute.
[00:39:36.669 --> 00:39:37.730]  Let's go back over this.
[00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.731]  So explain it.
[00:39:38.771 --> 00:39:47.077]  They said some little punk jail guard, some sadist, has this congressman, this icon, and they're telling you, I don't like your attitude, boy.
[00:39:47.278 --> 00:39:48.839]  You're going to spend how long in the hole?
[00:39:49.099 --> 00:39:54.223]  Well, they find out or you use little maneuvers that they have.
[00:39:54.243 --> 00:39:58.187]  I believe I spent close to seven months in the hole over a period of time.
[00:39:59.227 --> 00:40:04.312]  And in the hole means that you get to get a shower every second day, three times a week.
[00:40:04.732 --> 00:40:06.974]  You get to go out one hour a day.
[00:40:06.994 --> 00:40:09.396]  And to tell you the truth, Alex, I never left the place.
[00:40:10.709 --> 00:40:12.030]  I became very hardened.
[00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:15.251]  I think that they looked at me and said, this guy is very hard.
[00:40:15.711 --> 00:40:17.552]  Because I didn't give a damn about anything.
[00:40:17.612 --> 00:40:18.712]  I forfeited my life.
[00:40:19.312 --> 00:40:21.433]  If I survived, I'd do what I had to do.
[00:40:21.773 --> 00:40:23.254]  But I wasn't going to buckle down.
[00:40:23.274 --> 00:40:24.834]  I wasn't going to be intimidated.
[00:40:25.194 --> 00:40:26.015]  Stood my ground.
[00:40:26.095 --> 00:40:26.915]  Did what I had to do.
[00:40:27.555 --> 00:40:32.703]  But like I said, I could have had a pardon, but there's no way I was going to make admission to something that I didn't do.
[00:40:33.043 --> 00:40:35.386]  And I want all your listeners to listen to this very carefully.
[00:40:35.747 --> 00:40:38.831]  Six year investigation, $15 million, over 250 agents.
[00:40:41.289 --> 00:40:44.371]  And they said they didn't make any tapes on Jim Traffickin.
[00:40:44.672 --> 00:40:45.892]  Didn't bug my telephone.
[00:40:46.273 --> 00:40:51.076]  Now a Secret Service agent has come out, retired, Mike Robertson, and made the following statement.
[00:40:51.316 --> 00:40:53.038]  He said Traffickin was certainly railroaded.
[00:40:53.318 --> 00:40:54.719]  He said they had no physical evidence.
[00:40:54.979 --> 00:40:56.740]  He said they bugged that guy to death.
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:58.462]  They had people go to him with body mics.
[00:40:58.762 --> 00:41:00.683]  He said anybody in their right mind knows that.
[00:41:00.984 --> 00:41:09.610]  He said the reason the government voluntarily made that admission in court is because Traffickin could have subpoenaed all of their tapes and said, where's the crime?
[00:41:10.971 --> 00:41:12.494]  I want your listeners to remember this.
[00:41:13.576 --> 00:41:19.065]  They said they made no tapes, didn't bug my telephone or anything for six years now.
[00:41:19.346 --> 00:41:21.610]  If you believe that, I got some property down in Florida.
[00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:22.952]  I think somebody wants to sell you.
[00:41:23.151 --> 00:41:25.933]  Well, sir, you've been vindicated, and that's all over the press.
[00:41:25.973 --> 00:41:30.657]  I mean, you have officially been vindicated, like Governor Siegelman, but he only got nine months.
[00:41:30.677 --> 00:41:33.058]  You got seven and a half years and got financially ruined.
[00:41:33.499 --> 00:41:34.900]  How are you going to come back at him?
[00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.722]  I mean, you now have his Secret Service agent.
[00:41:37.742 --> 00:41:42.025]  You have all these other witnesses against you recanting that it was done under pressure.
[00:41:42.325 --> 00:41:49.171]  You've got to get on the attack, in my estimation, or correct me if I'm wrong, or they're going to try to set you up again.
[00:41:49.191 --> 00:41:50.271]  Here's where we are, Alex.
[00:41:51.232 --> 00:41:53.414]  Right now, there's a man in Washington, D.C.
[00:41:53.474 --> 00:41:55.136]  that was pressured to lie against me.
[00:41:55.696 --> 00:41:57.478]  He's a brilliant man, Richard Detour.
[00:41:57.538 --> 00:42:00.181]  He could fly any aircraft, and he's a brilliant engineer.
[00:42:00.741 --> 00:42:04.845]  And the government wanted him to be a witness against me because he was very intelligent, very credible.
[00:42:05.266 --> 00:42:11.792]  And they wanted him to say that he saw a businessman give me an envelope with money, thousands of dollars, in my office.
[00:42:12.361 --> 00:42:13.922]  And he basically said, I won't do that.
[00:42:14.002 --> 00:42:17.063]  I know, Jim, if he's done something wrong, go after him, but I'm not going to lie.
[00:42:17.723 --> 00:42:23.365]  They come back to him later, and they pressured him to say that he was standing outside the door, and he heard the transaction.
[00:42:23.385 --> 00:42:24.686]  He said, I just won't do it.
[00:42:25.266 --> 00:42:27.306]  Now, his attorney that he had was a former U.S.
[00:42:27.387 --> 00:42:29.847]  attorney who was pressuring him along with the government.
[00:42:30.448 --> 00:42:34.009]  So he fired that attorney, and they indicted him to keep him out of my case.
[00:42:34.727 --> 00:42:38.651]  Bottom line is, here's how egregious it was.
[00:42:39.232 --> 00:42:47.000]  When they brought the witness to testify against me in trial, he stated that he gave me the money in an automobile in Youngstown, Ohio.
[00:42:47.801 --> 00:42:50.104]  But the government is clearly on record now.
[00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:56.556]  Clearly on record as trying to pressure Richard Detour to say that he saw the transaction in my office.
[00:42:56.997 --> 00:42:58.739]  And it was the prosecutor who was doing this.
[00:42:58.799 --> 00:43:08.770]  By the way, the prosecutor is now working for some insurance company in Columbus, Ohio, and everybody's scared to death of what happened because they know that I'm not as afraid to speak my mind.
[00:43:09.192 --> 00:43:12.455]  Well, let's stop there for a second, former Congressman James Traficant.
[00:43:12.915 --> 00:43:14.997]  I'm sure you're aware of Don Siegelman's case.
[00:43:15.497 --> 00:43:18.300]  It's even 60 Minutes reported it was all a staged deal.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.483]  The majority of these former state attorneys, U.S.
[00:43:21.503 --> 00:43:22.844]  attorneys, came out and said it was a fraud.
[00:43:22.864 --> 00:43:25.586]  A bunch of Republicans came to his aid, even though he's a Democrat.
[00:43:25.926 --> 00:43:36.095]  They, it's now admitted, ordered one of his aides to lie and say he saw the check, the same thing, and it turned out that was a complete lie.
[00:43:36.415 --> 00:43:36.936]  So this is
[00:43:37.416 --> 00:43:40.479]  And it's now been confirmed Karl Rove ordered this.
[00:43:40.519 --> 00:43:43.622]  I mean, do you know specifically in the U.S.
[00:43:43.662 --> 00:43:46.404]  Attorney's Office who gave the orders to set you up?
[00:43:46.724 --> 00:43:47.205]  Yes, I do.
[00:43:47.245 --> 00:43:54.131]  I don't know who exactly did it, but it was supervised by Michael Chertoff, who they rewarded him, made him head of Homeland Security.
[00:43:54.171 --> 00:43:54.711]  It was over.
[00:43:55.012 --> 00:43:58.555]  And they made the prosecutor, in my case, number two man in the Justice Department.
[00:43:58.935 --> 00:43:59.216]  I think so.
[00:44:16.425 --> 00:44:17.085]  We're good to go.
[00:44:32.831 --> 00:44:33.291]  We're good to go.
[00:44:54.669 --> 00:44:56.572]  60 Minutes come in and did a story on Sigelman.
[00:44:56.993 --> 00:44:58.294]  I'm going to tell it right the way it is.
[00:44:58.735 --> 00:45:04.703]  When you're the number one target of the American-Israeli Public Affairs Committee, 60 Minutes don't have anything good to say about you.
[00:45:06.285 --> 00:45:09.390]  Now that's putting a hay where the goats can reach it, Alex.
[00:45:10.384 --> 00:45:11.705]  Well, let's talk more about that.
[00:45:12.285 --> 00:45:13.145]  Were you warned?
[00:45:13.245 --> 00:45:19.488]  If I didn't have this powerful Jewish animus against me, I think I'd be a very rich man for what they did.
[00:45:19.768 --> 00:45:21.769]  But I'm still the top target of Israel.
[00:45:22.229 --> 00:45:28.672]  Quite frankly, I think they're delaying that trial over there in Germany because they do not want me to testify over there in Germany.
[00:45:29.032 --> 00:45:31.153]  They're hoping that old man will die in Germany.
[00:45:32.555 --> 00:45:35.576]  Well, let's expand on this Israel situation.
[00:45:36.296 --> 00:45:37.797]  Let's go through from the start.
[00:45:38.177 --> 00:45:41.538]  When did you first get on the Israeli lobby's radar?
[00:45:41.878 --> 00:45:44.239]  Were there back-channel threats to you in Congress?
[00:45:45.039 --> 00:45:46.600]  Did they warn you to back off first?
[00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:47.120]  What happened?
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:50.781]  Well, first of all, right when I was running, they tried to give me $10,000 cash.
[00:45:51.041 --> 00:45:54.442]  I told them, you keep your money and I'll keep my vote.
[00:45:54.462 --> 00:45:56.583]  So I think I was targeted before I ever walked down there.
[00:45:57.123 --> 00:45:58.883]  How did you get involved in the case?
[00:46:21.388 --> 00:46:23.910]  They came to me, Alex, because they knew they were from Cleveland.
[00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:26.693]  They knew the government hated me, and they came to me last.
[00:46:26.753 --> 00:46:29.155]  They said no one would even talk with them.
[00:46:29.755 --> 00:46:39.724]  In fact, I was in my office overhearing the conversation outside, and they said we come to the gym last because no one will talk to us, and we didn't want to come to the gym.
[00:46:39.744 --> 00:46:43.247]  We know the government hates them, but we have no one to look into our plates.
[00:46:43.934 --> 00:46:46.276]  And he says, you know, and I never forget the son.
[00:46:46.316 --> 00:46:48.558]  I heard the son say, look, I never had a speeding ticket.
[00:46:48.618 --> 00:46:50.440]  I can't talk to an elected representative.
[00:46:50.941 --> 00:46:52.602]  My father's not asking to talk to him.
[00:46:52.642 --> 00:46:54.204]  I'm asking, what the hell's going on here?
[00:46:55.024 --> 00:46:57.006]  I said, send that young man into me.
[00:46:57.086 --> 00:47:06.595]  And when I did that, Alex, my staff told me almost verbatim, if you get involved in this case, you are finished as a congressman.
[00:47:08.021 --> 00:47:10.884]  You're already on the hit list for your cutting foreign aid.
[00:47:11.404 --> 00:47:12.666]  You get involved with this case.
[00:47:12.706 --> 00:47:17.851]  Now, what the newspaper didn't print, they all printed, trafficking supports Nazi mass murderer.
[00:47:18.231 --> 00:47:20.433]  What they didn't print was what I told the family.
[00:47:20.834 --> 00:47:23.856]  When they came in, I said, look, your father's been convicted of mass murder.
[00:47:24.237 --> 00:47:26.559]  If he is guilty, I could truly go over and pull the switch.
[00:47:26.939 --> 00:47:28.441]  But I believe you should be able to at least
[00:47:29.335 --> 00:47:34.602]  Take your case to somebody in government and it should have been your own congressman, your own senators.
[00:47:35.163 --> 00:47:36.445]  They said no one would talk to them.
[00:47:36.845 --> 00:47:39.990]  I got involved and when I found out, Alex, that he was not Ivan.
[00:47:40.367 --> 00:47:41.067]  Well let me stop you.
[00:47:41.087 --> 00:47:41.668]  Let me stop you.
[00:47:41.928 --> 00:47:42.508]  Think about this.
[00:47:42.548 --> 00:47:43.489]  You're a congressman.
[00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:50.674]  This guy is supposedly a kangaroo court convicted Nazi and of course the Supreme Court of Israel said actually it's the wrong guy.
[00:47:50.994 --> 00:47:52.055]  It agreed with you.
[00:47:52.816 --> 00:47:56.638]  So why would you get into something this dangerous unless you had a sense of justice?
[00:47:56.678 --> 00:47:58.319]  So you began to look at the case.
[00:47:58.499 --> 00:47:59.000]  What was there?
[00:47:59.844 --> 00:48:07.832]  Well, I started to get, I was known in Congress for taking a look at things objectively and people were not afraid to confide in me.
[00:48:07.952 --> 00:48:10.354]  Before long, I started to get whistleblower activity.
[00:48:10.935 --> 00:48:14.198]  And the whistleblower type of things I got led me to certain conclusions.
[00:48:14.298 --> 00:48:22.687]  And I moved with a Freedom of Information Act request on Demoniuk, and they just kept drawing it in file 13 and saying, classify, classify, classify.
[00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:25.852]  And what I did is basically trick them, Alex.
[00:48:26.532 --> 00:48:34.899]  I started to look around and I researched, was there ever anybody tried for war crimes who was located at that Treblinka, Poland, concentration camp?
[00:48:35.279 --> 00:48:41.924]  And there was a man from Chicago, a Ukrainian, who ended up coming to the Chicago area by the name of Fyodor Fedorenko.
[00:48:42.405 --> 00:48:46.708]  He was tried for war crimes in America, at Treblinka, and was acquitted in America.
[00:48:47.308 --> 00:48:51.071]  Alex, he then went to visit his family in Ukraine, relieved of all the pressure.
[00:48:51.372 --> 00:48:54.334]  He was picked up by the KGB, tried over there, and executed.
[00:48:54.954 --> 00:48:58.577]  What I did is I submitted a Freedom of Information Act request on Fedorenko.
[00:48:59.138 --> 00:49:01.660]  And with that, I got documents from the State Department.
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:03.641]  And he looked just like the other guy?
[00:49:03.922 --> 00:49:04.162]  Yeah.
[00:49:05.017 --> 00:49:16.905]  Well no, the documents I got from the State Department was in response to a request for information from one of our agents, Justice Department agents, over in Germany years ago, maybe 25 years ago.
[00:49:17.906 --> 00:49:21.588]  And it had on the bottom, Alex, it said they had another 100 pages in the file.
[00:49:22.509 --> 00:49:28.713]  I immediately got on the phone and I called and got a Mrs. Poindexter, because they took all my files and everything.
[00:49:29.394 --> 00:49:32.356]  And I said, this man's been dead for a number of years, he's not classified.
[00:49:32.736 --> 00:49:33.476]  I want those 100 pages.
[00:49:34.835 --> 00:49:36.056]  And that woman sent him to me.
[00:49:36.396 --> 00:49:44.462]  And Alex, when it came over, it had testimony of trials of everybody who identified Ivan the Terrible as a man named Ivan Marchenko.
[00:49:44.923 --> 00:49:47.865]  But the big thing was, there was a photograph in there of two Nazis.
[00:49:48.505 --> 00:49:51.388]  And the guy identified the photograph as follows.
[00:49:51.428 --> 00:49:54.470]  He said, the small man on the right is Takchuk with the pistol.
[00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:57.132]  The tall man on the left is Ivan Grozny.
[00:49:58.484 --> 00:50:01.825]  The man the Jewish prisoners feared the most, Ivan Marchenko.
[00:50:02.165 --> 00:50:08.787]  Now I had this, and I went on the House floor, and I said, Ivan the Terrible is a man named Ivan Marchenko.
[00:50:09.068 --> 00:50:12.749]  And when you ever hear the Justice Department make a response, that night they put out a press release.
[00:50:12.989 --> 00:50:18.751]  His name is even Ivan, and the only thing is he looked a little similar to the guy living in Ohio.
[00:50:18.971 --> 00:50:19.591]  Not really.
[00:50:19.611 --> 00:50:24.993]  When you hear this, the Justice Department went public and said there were two Ivans.
[00:50:26.815 --> 00:50:27.715]  Now, you know what I said?
[00:50:27.775 --> 00:50:29.296]  I said, you sure there wasn't a swing shift?
[00:50:29.596 --> 00:50:31.097]  And then I showed the photograph.
[00:50:31.697 --> 00:50:33.958]  When that happened, everything went underground.
[00:50:34.998 --> 00:50:36.279]  The Justice Department shut up.
[00:50:36.359 --> 00:50:37.839]  Next thing you know, I'm over in Israel.
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:40.320]  And I think it became a real issue.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:42.401]  And I got to give credit to the Israeli Supreme Court.
[00:50:43.098 --> 00:50:46.082]  The Israeli Supreme Court looked at the evidence that take this man home.
[00:50:46.282 --> 00:50:47.684]  But see, that's the issue.
[00:50:47.704 --> 00:50:50.248]  The Israeli Supreme Court says he's innocent.
[00:50:50.448 --> 00:50:51.649]  You have the secret files.
[00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:52.370]  It proves it.
[00:50:52.871 --> 00:50:55.194]  Meanwhile, the American-Israeli groups, after you.
[00:50:55.214 --> 00:50:56.195]  Stay there, Congressman.
[00:50:56.236 --> 00:50:58.458]  This is amazing information.
[00:50:58.939 --> 00:50:59.960]  James Traficant is our guest.
[00:51:01.118 --> 00:51:02.500]  Is it safe to breathe anymore?
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:13.853]  Crowded public places, global pandemics and news reports of potential new strains of bacteria and viruses make you wonder, what if there was a germ killing nasal spray that acted almost like hand sanitizer for your nose?
[00:51:14.193 --> 00:51:14.794]  There is!
[00:51:15.175 --> 00:51:18.899]  It's called Sinofresh homeopathic nasal spray and it's a proven germ killer.
[00:51:19.239 --> 00:51:27.426]  Cynofresh is a revolutionary doctor recommended nasal spray that kills a broad spectrum of viruses, bacteria, molds and fungi on contact in your nose.
[00:51:27.826 --> 00:51:35.673]  Cynofresh causes no drug interactions, no loss of smell, no rebound congestion, contains no alcohol, is non-habit forming and is safe for daily use.
[00:51:35.973 --> 00:51:38.455]  Cynofresh must be a part of your family survival plan.

[00:52:00.811 --> 00:52:03.975]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[00:52:04.195 --> 00:52:12.224]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[00:52:12.384 --> 00:52:15.828]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable
[00:52:15.948 --> 00:52:17.269]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:52:17.309 --> 00:52:21.391]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:52:21.431 --> 00:52:28.335]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:52:28.435 --> 00:52:31.057]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:52:44.424 --> 00:52:49.170]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:52:49.290 --> 00:52:52.053]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:52:52.193 --> 00:52:52.433]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:52:52.453 --> 00:52:53.855]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:52:59.648 --> 00:53:00.909]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:53:00.949 --> 00:53:06.274]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:53:06.534 --> 00:53:11.158]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:53:11.559 --> 00:53:16.643]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:53:17.144 --> 00:53:21.808]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:53:22.332 --> 00:53:29.277]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:53:29.457 --> 00:53:30.357]  And here's the best part.
[00:53:30.577 --> 00:53:36.961]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:53:37.262 --> 00:53:40.104]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:53:40.464 --> 00:53:43.606]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:53:47.248 --> 00:53:49.031]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:53:50.213 --> 00:53:56.001]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:53:56.321 --> 00:53:58.685]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:54:14.707 --> 00:54:18.469]  Bob Chapman, the international forecaster, is coming up at the 8 after next hour.
[00:54:18.489 --> 00:54:22.512]  Former Congressman James Travagan will be with us another five minutes to the next hour.
[00:54:22.532 --> 00:54:23.613]  He says he wants to come back.
[00:54:24.053 --> 00:54:25.434]  We really appreciate his courage.
[00:54:25.554 --> 00:54:26.314]  I've studied him.
[00:54:26.574 --> 00:54:27.515]  I've looked at what he's done.
[00:54:27.535 --> 00:54:30.757]  I looked at why he took the case of the supposed camp guard.
[00:54:31.117 --> 00:54:32.358]  Turned out it was just all lies.
[00:54:32.778 --> 00:54:33.699]  And the government knows that.
[00:54:33.719 --> 00:54:35.140]  The Israeli Supreme Court ruled that.
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:42.962]  Why did the Israelis tell the truth about this, but then in America the Israeli lobby came after you?
[00:54:43.022 --> 00:54:45.862]  Is it two different groups or one different group?
[00:54:46.323 --> 00:54:49.803]  You were telling me during the break you think this is all going to hurt Israel and that's not what you want?
[00:54:50.343 --> 00:54:51.364]  No, absolutely not.
[00:54:51.604 --> 00:54:56.845]  I think I've been branded as anti-Semite and quite frankly I am a supporter of Israel.
[00:54:57.620 --> 00:54:59.541]  I support Israel when they're doing what's right.
[00:54:59.581 --> 00:55:03.323]  When they do something wrong, I'm not going to be remiss here and not mention it.
[00:55:03.423 --> 00:55:06.084]  I believe that they have undue control of our government.
[00:55:06.364 --> 00:55:08.565]  But I'd like to say this, to start with.
[00:55:09.025 --> 00:55:13.647]  The Israeli Supreme Court gave a lesson in justice to the United States of America.
[00:55:14.107 --> 00:55:18.169]  This was the most controversial case, perhaps, in Israeli history, one of them.
[00:55:18.649 --> 00:55:22.371]  And they looked at the evidence, Alex, and they said, take him home.
[00:55:23.095 --> 00:55:31.480]  Now, what everybody doesn't know, Alex, is that our government went back and wanted Israel to prosecute Demonyik again on this other charge.
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:35.062]  And the Israeli Supreme Court would not allow it.
[00:55:36.163 --> 00:55:37.884]  So let's give kudos where it's due.
[00:55:38.304 --> 00:55:40.565]  Let's give it to Israel and their Supreme Court.
[00:55:41.206 --> 00:55:46.829]  Okay, so then how does the Supreme Court of Israel agree with you and the government files that prove it 100%?
[00:55:47.289 --> 00:55:49.351]  Why is AIPAC putting you in prison?
[00:55:50.551 --> 00:55:51.492]  Well, I think it...
[00:55:52.464 --> 00:56:08.102]  Once you're targeted, and they fired a woman in 1990 or 1991, I don't know if you remember this, Alex, a top-ranking woman in the American-Israeli Public Affairs Committee, and she gave out their hit list of the politicians that they wanted to get rid of, and Jim Traffickin was the number one target in the world.
[00:56:08.931 --> 00:56:12.854]  And I think it was because the way I handled that case, no one would help me.
[00:56:13.154 --> 00:56:18.598]  And I went to the House floor, and I dramatically presented the case on behalf of Dominic and his family.
[00:56:19.138 --> 00:56:28.784]  And I believe that I riled up many, many of the people, whether they felt that just the fact that I looked into this case, that no one should look into it, I had to have some anti-semite blood.
[00:56:28.805 --> 00:56:29.685]  This is what they said.
[00:56:30.105 --> 00:56:33.548]  And now Germany's hauled this guy off, he's on the death's doorstep.
[00:56:34.192 --> 00:56:42.796]  Yeah, I think they're holding and delaying this because I firmly believe that they do not want me over in Germany to speak out on this issue.
[00:56:43.536 --> 00:56:46.897]  I think they're holding this case up, holding that the old man will die over there.
[00:56:47.137 --> 00:56:47.938]  But what a shame.
[00:56:48.198 --> 00:56:49.698]  He was not guilty, Alex.
[00:56:50.819 --> 00:56:51.419]  Bottom line.
[00:56:51.699 --> 00:56:52.499]  And let me say this.
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:58.402]  When you allow one citizen's rights to be trampled, you endanger the rights of all Americans.
[00:56:58.742 --> 00:56:59.802]  What the hell is wrong with us?
[00:57:00.103 --> 00:57:00.943]  What have we come to?
[00:57:01.883 --> 00:57:03.324]  What have we turned into here, Alex?
[00:57:03.666 --> 00:57:11.028]  Well that's why I support you because I mean I looked at the facts and you've been persecuted a lot worse than Siegelman and he's been vindicated.
[00:57:11.068 --> 00:57:14.629]  You've been vindicated as well but not... What comes next?
[00:57:14.669 --> 00:57:16.930]  I mean how do you go after these guys?
[00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:17.810]  Do you sue people?
[00:57:17.850 --> 00:57:19.231]  Do you call for new investigations?
[00:57:19.271 --> 00:57:19.691]  What do you do?
[00:57:20.472 --> 00:57:25.458]  I really don't have any strength to do that, but this fella in Washington, D.C., this Richard Detour, may file suit.
[00:57:25.539 --> 00:57:29.063]  If he does, I will then back up into that suit as well.
[00:57:29.684 --> 00:57:31.507]  It's going to be a long, hard struggle.
[00:57:31.807 --> 00:57:36.574]  But I think that there's so many revelations to do that it's going to surprise an awful lot of people.
[00:57:36.954 --> 00:57:38.915]  But right now, I'm looking politically.
[00:57:39.216 --> 00:57:50.423]  I'm looking at politically not just for vengeance, but looking politically because I think America needs somebody to speak out on what the hell's going wrong, who's not afraid to speak out, who's not controlled by their party.
[00:57:50.744 --> 00:57:53.886]  I think too many of the politicians today have allegiance to the party.
[00:57:54.246 --> 00:57:55.867]  Allegiance should be to the American people.
[00:57:55.887 --> 00:57:57.348]  And so you're planning to run as an independent?
[00:57:57.368 --> 00:57:58.269]  Give us the battle plan.
[00:57:58.609 --> 00:58:03.354]  I mean, why not use the machinery like Ron Paul does and use their machinery, you would still be an independent.
[00:58:23.095 --> 00:58:25.397]  It would be impossible for me to do that.
[00:58:25.617 --> 00:58:28.200]  I would be so, so castigated here.
[00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:31.123]  I have to basically run as an independent.
[00:58:31.143 --> 00:58:36.247]  It would be hypocritical for me to run now as a Democrat with the position that I've taken.
[00:58:36.268 --> 00:58:36.968]  Okay, we got a break.
[00:58:37.068 --> 00:58:37.589]  One minute, sir.
[00:58:37.809 --> 00:58:38.149]  Stay there.
[00:58:38.169 --> 00:58:43.454]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:43.955 --> 00:58:47.158]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.501 --> 00:58:54.164]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:58:54.184 --> 00:58:57.527]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:58:57.767 --> 00:59:02.551]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:59:02.571 --> 00:59:08.796]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:08.956 --> 00:59:11.198]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:11.698 --> 00:59:12.018]  Tim Geithner?
[00:59:12.038 --> 00:59:12.459]  Bernanke?
[00:59:12.539 --> 00:59:13.139]  They're arsonists!
[00:59:13.159 --> 00:59:13.860]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:16.001]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:30.632 --> 00:59:32.472]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:32.752 --> 00:59:37.594]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:59:37.894 --> 00:59:47.836]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:52.237 --> 00:59:54.137]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:54.617 --> 00:59:57.398]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:03.928 --> 01:00:04.570]  Big Brother.
[01:00:05.232 --> 01:00:06.294]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.016 --> 01:00:08.119]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:08.781 --> 01:00:09.563]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.345 --> 01:00:11.147]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:11.895 --> 01:00:15.516]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.076 --> 01:00:20.158]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:20.758 --> 01:00:22.358]  Well, he doesn't do a lot of interviews.
[01:00:22.738 --> 01:00:26.599]  He did a big one on Fox News, as you know, a while back, that sent shockwaves across the country.
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:30.100]  But he's been on with us for an hour, and he says he'll come back soon.
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:30.901]  We're very thankful.
[01:00:31.541 --> 01:00:34.842]  James Traficant, I was asking you during that one-minute break, former Congressman,
[01:00:36.283 --> 01:00:49.447]  Other key points, and you brought up the fact that you have people in Washington that are telling you you are being watched, and that there was a big secret investigation about the Denomiac case, but it was about how the traffic can't get the info.
[01:00:49.727 --> 01:00:57.670]  Yes, when I brought them on, the big investigation didn't center about, you know, how they suborned perjury to ruin this man's life.
[01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:59.911]  This was a capital offense, they were going to put the death penalty.
[01:01:00.351 --> 01:01:03.172]  It wasn't about how they withheld evidence about how they
[01:01:03.892 --> 01:01:12.354]  I mean, it's unbelievable some of the things you hear.
[01:01:12.414 --> 01:01:14.675]  So I just worked very hard.
[01:01:14.695 --> 01:01:18.776]  I just put my nose to the grindstone and kept going and that's about it.
[01:01:18.816 --> 01:01:20.917]  That's all you can do Alex, but I'll tell you something.
[01:01:21.457 --> 01:01:22.497]  We've got a real problem.
[01:01:23.017 --> 01:01:24.438]  No one should fear our government.
[01:01:24.818 --> 01:01:28.199]  The government, if anybody, they should be fearing the American people.
[01:01:28.539 --> 01:01:29.999]  American people are the government.
[01:01:30.439 --> 01:01:35.280]  And we've got this thing so convoluted and messed up, it's really a crime shame and it's got to be changed.
[01:01:37.461 --> 01:01:42.742]  We also need to thank your wife in all of this, Patricia Travacant.
[01:01:42.762 --> 01:01:45.103]  She stood beside you, you stood beside her.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:46.960]  You know Alex,
[01:02:13.129 --> 01:02:18.891]  I've gotten volumes of mail all through the seven and a half years, and one of the reasons I got them is people follow my little one-minute speeches.
[01:02:19.432 --> 01:02:21.092]  And I just didn't do them in the grandstand.
[01:02:21.152 --> 01:02:25.874]  I made salient points during that time and dramatized things that I think had to be made.
[01:02:26.174 --> 01:02:29.215]  But I became known for the statement, beam me up.
[01:02:29.775 --> 01:02:32.436]  And basically I just said beam me up because there's no intelligent life here.
[01:02:32.456 --> 01:02:36.478]  But here's what I'd like to say to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:02:38.416 --> 01:02:39.737]  You don't need to be beamed up.
[01:02:39.777 --> 01:02:49.804]  Jim Travigan doesn't need to be beamed up on Alex Jones' show because there is an intelligent audience there and there is a message coming out that's educating that audience.
[01:02:50.624 --> 01:02:54.547]  And believe me when I say this, if more people were listening to Alex,
[01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:55.690]  Ha ha!
[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:17.461]  I don't know what happened to Chairman Archer, Bill Archer.
[01:03:17.921 --> 01:03:26.003]  But Alex, I want you to run him down, I want you to find him, and I want you to say that Jim Traffickin said thank you on behalf of the American people.
[01:03:26.923 --> 01:03:27.664]  Absolutely.
[01:03:27.944 --> 01:03:29.464]  We've got about a minute left here.
[01:03:30.725 --> 01:03:34.646]  What's the time frame for the election for people to start getting behind you in Ohio?
[01:03:34.866 --> 01:03:42.128]  Well, that means I'll be on the ballot in the November election, but I have to get signatures signed, I have to get petitions signed up until May the 3rd.
[01:03:43.064 --> 01:03:46.906]  I need a couple thousand signatures here, and it's going to be an uphill struggle.
[01:03:46.927 --> 01:03:51.109]  I'm not supported by any newspaper, any political party, any entity of anything.
[01:03:51.229 --> 01:03:53.851]  It's an uphill struggle, but you know what?
[01:03:54.952 --> 01:03:55.972]  I've had it.
[01:03:56.893 --> 01:03:58.594]  And maybe get back to where we started.
[01:03:59.787 --> 01:04:08.790]  Well, the first thing we need, first thing we need, and we're going to get some domains and just give them to you to make sure whoever the volunteer is doesn't just get a domain and keep it.
[01:04:09.090 --> 01:04:10.330]  We've already grabbed some domains.
[01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:11.291]  We're going to give them to you.
[01:04:11.631 --> 01:04:15.892]  You need to get a volunteer to build you a nice website with PayPal buttons, the rest of it.
[01:04:16.232 --> 01:04:23.755]  Get everybody doing these petitions now because we do need you in Congress to counterbalance all the offshore corporate forces.
[01:04:24.315 --> 01:04:25.556]  And others that are doing this.
[01:04:25.996 --> 01:04:30.240]  And thank you so much, former Congressman James Traficant, for your courage.
[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:31.221]  And we're all praying for you.
[01:04:31.241 --> 01:04:34.783]  And we're glad they weren't able to kill you or break your will in prison.
[01:04:34.803 --> 01:04:37.686]  And it seems you've come out even stronger on the other side.
[01:04:38.277 --> 01:04:40.019]  Well, Alex, thank you for having me on your show.
[01:04:40.079 --> 01:04:41.019]  You've got a great show.
[01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:42.581]  You get a great message to people.
[01:04:43.021 --> 01:04:49.667]  I think if I could leave anything there, I'd just say tune in to Alex's show, and I hope you get more coverage around the country.
[01:04:49.947 --> 01:04:52.089]  I think they need to hear a rational voice like yours.
[01:04:52.570 --> 01:04:54.191]  So thanks for having me, Alex, and good luck.
[01:04:54.291 --> 01:04:56.593]  Beam me up, but you don't need it down there in Texas.
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.401]  Friends, I hope that you will order

[01:06:00.014 --> 01:06:02.616]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:06:03.016 --> 01:06:07.980]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:10.081]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:06:10.401 --> 01:06:15.204]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:06:15.405 --> 01:06:16.365]  How much do you want?
[01:06:16.585 --> 01:06:17.326]  When do you want it?
[01:06:17.706 --> 01:06:19.307]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:06:19.587 --> 01:06:20.408]  When will you need it?
[01:06:20.668 --> 01:06:22.730]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:23.970]  Will there be any food?
[01:06:24.211 --> 01:06:25.552]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:06:25.732 --> 01:06:26.092]  If there's a
[01:06:26.152 --> 01:06:28.093]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:06:28.253 --> 01:06:30.775]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:06:30.975 --> 01:06:34.177]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:06:34.557 --> 01:06:38.079]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:06:38.379 --> 01:06:39.380]  How much will you need?
[01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:40.220]  We don't know.
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:41.421]  How much do you want?
[01:06:41.621 --> 01:06:42.361]  All you can get.
[01:06:42.542 --> 01:06:42.942]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:43.642 --> 01:06:43.863]  I think.
[01:06:59.284 --> 01:07:00.264]  What's your home worth?
[01:07:00.444 --> 01:07:02.365]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:07:02.545 --> 01:07:05.286]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[01:07:05.586 --> 01:07:13.108]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[01:08:00.453 --> 01:08:06.278]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:07.179 --> 01:08:12.744]  Well, every Friday in the third hour, Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com joins us.
[01:08:12.764 --> 01:08:13.685]  We're going to him in a moment.
[01:08:14.345 --> 01:08:18.469]  Popping in via video, Skype, PrisonPlanet.tv, viewers and audio for radio listeners.
[01:08:19.069 --> 01:08:21.932]  We're going to have about 10-15 minutes coming up at the bottom of the hour with
[01:08:24.013 --> 01:08:28.696]  Mike Rivero to give us his take with Bob Chapman on the Kamikaze attack in Austin.
[01:08:28.716 --> 01:08:30.698]  The media trying to say it was the tea parties that did it.
[01:08:30.938 --> 01:08:33.240]  As I predicted before the media even said it, they would.
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:35.121]  Very, very suspicious.
[01:08:35.141 --> 01:08:40.285]  We're going to recap all of that coming up and of course wide open phones on the Kamikaze attack.
[01:08:40.765 --> 01:08:41.325]  I don't think so.
[01:08:58.937 --> 01:08:59.337]  Thank you.
[01:09:19.537 --> 01:09:22.941]  And they have 10% off until Monday.
[01:09:23.001 --> 01:09:25.324]  Their once a month special being run right now.
[01:09:25.344 --> 01:09:28.227]  10% off on some of their key units.
[01:09:28.848 --> 01:09:32.933]  Just tell them the product code ALEXJONES to get that discount.
[01:09:33.233 --> 01:09:35.656]  acolablue.com or 800-691-6043.
[01:09:35.796 --> 01:09:38.299]  It grabs water out of the air.
[01:09:38.339 --> 01:09:39.160]  That's what the clouds are.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:42.382]  AcolaBlue.com, 800-691-6043.
[01:09:42.823 --> 01:09:46.986]  Also want to tell you about MySolarBackup.com.
[01:09:47.586 --> 01:09:51.249]  Have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[01:09:51.309 --> 01:09:58.214]  If so, you should check out MySolarBackup.com, because there's never been a better time to start getting off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[01:09:58.254 --> 01:09:58.734]  Here's why.
[01:09:59.055 --> 01:10:01.517]  Plug and play solar generators from Solutions from Science.
[01:10:02.077 --> 01:10:08.362]  These portable power systems need no installation, supply household current whenever and whenever you need it, producing electricity directly from the sun,
[01:10:09.022 --> 01:10:12.125]  Unlike gas generators, solar generator runs quietly and emits no fumes.
[01:10:12.145 --> 01:10:13.767]  It's like having your own electric power plant.
[01:10:13.827 --> 01:10:23.415]  It's perfectly your home or your campsite or outside your little shack where you're doing electrical work or hobbies, you know, to drive your tools, your power tools.
[01:10:24.116 --> 01:10:28.878]  Whatever it's, hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:10:29.139 --> 01:10:37.923]  MySolarBackup.com, because it has a battery system, not just during the day.
[01:10:37.943 --> 01:10:38.103]  877-327-0365.
[01:10:38.123 --> 01:10:38.523]  877-327-0365.
[01:10:38.563 --> 01:10:40.124]  MySolarBackup.com.
[01:10:41.005 --> 01:10:45.407]  Okay, going to Bob Chappin before we get into the economy, the kamikaze attack, and more.
[01:10:45.727 --> 01:10:47.288]  You just heard Trafficant on.
[01:10:47.628 --> 01:10:48.728]  Bob, I know you're on hold.
[01:10:49.149 --> 01:10:53.591]  Man, it's good to see him up and fighting like this and surviving his railroading into prison.
[01:10:55.211 --> 01:10:57.592]  We certainly need him, that's for sure.
[01:10:58.612 --> 01:10:59.713]  This guy is fearless.
[01:11:00.153 --> 01:11:02.294]  As you said, he's stronger now than he's ever been.
[01:11:02.314 --> 01:11:16.640]  And I hope that his coming back will cause these people in Washington and in New York City spasms of despair.
[01:11:18.766 --> 01:11:23.987]  Well, over 90% in polls now want to abolish the Fed or audit it.
[01:11:24.007 --> 01:11:28.269]  75% are angry, Republican and Democrat and independent at government policies.
[01:11:28.329 --> 01:11:30.889]  Rasmussen, it's gaining a few points every week.
[01:11:31.269 --> 01:11:33.770]  I mean, the government is collapsing right now.
[01:11:33.810 --> 01:11:41.352]  Before we get into all the big developments in the last week in the economy that people tune in to hear your expertise on and your insight every week, the Kamikaze attack.
[01:11:42.172 --> 01:11:44.613]  Is he a lone angry guy who was persecuted?
[01:11:45.553 --> 01:11:46.515]  Is it a setup?
[01:11:47.236 --> 01:11:52.866]  The fact that instantly they said Tea Parties did it and then lo and behold he was angry at the tax system is very suspicious.
[01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:59.171]  The reports we got that they had the emergency crews there, that was on the local news before it happened.
[01:11:59.491 --> 01:12:02.091]  We talked to multiple witnesses, not just the local newscast.
[01:12:02.632 --> 01:12:10.254]  The fact that one of our sources in the FBI said they had a threat to buildings, government buildings, the night before and dispatched Dallas agents.
[01:12:10.554 --> 01:12:12.294]  Was that because of his screed on the web?
[01:12:12.334 --> 01:12:13.815]  That doesn't prove inside job.
[01:12:14.395 --> 01:12:15.595]  The fact is we don't know.
[01:12:15.915 --> 01:12:19.276]  Looking at this Bob Chapman, 24, now 28 hours in, what do you think's going on?
[01:12:24.383 --> 01:12:28.766]  There's a lot of conflicting information, and that makes it difficult.
[01:12:29.626 --> 01:12:31.087]  We're on the outside looking in.
[01:12:32.047 --> 01:12:36.550]  We're backing into what we think can be a solution as to why it happened.
[01:12:38.711 --> 01:12:41.073]  The Tea Party, I don't think, has anything to do with it.
[01:12:42.474 --> 01:12:52.039]  I think that this man was hounded by the Eternal Revenue Service, and he saw all the things going on around him.
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:53.540]  He didn't like it.
[01:12:54.225 --> 01:12:58.988]  He was losing what he had, he wanted to get back at him, and he was prepared to die to do it.
[01:12:59.849 --> 01:13:01.050]  And I think that's what happened.
[01:13:03.491 --> 01:13:04.012]  Continue.
[01:13:07.654 --> 01:13:22.684]  As far as the emergency equipment being available before it happened, if the FBI was called or found out that he was going to do that,
[01:13:23.464 --> 01:13:26.485]  Because of something he said on the internet.
[01:13:28.505 --> 01:13:39.569]  I would think that that would be a reasonable explanation as to why it was there and maybe the FBI was on to the whole thing but probably didn't know how to stop it.
[01:13:41.589 --> 01:13:43.830]  Or didn't want to stop it so they could play the victim.
[01:13:45.094 --> 01:13:46.014]  Well that's true too.
[01:13:46.034 --> 01:13:55.818]  I mean if they're coming down to Austin or they already have emergency equipment out there and all this is going on, they knew where his airplane supposedly was in Georgetown, why weren't they there?
[01:13:57.079 --> 01:13:57.979]  That's a good question.
[01:13:58.559 --> 01:14:08.463]  So if all of that is fact, that they did know where his plane was, they should have been down there guarding it or impounding it or something.
[01:14:09.397 --> 01:14:10.298]  Well, we're not sure.
[01:14:10.318 --> 01:14:18.731]  I mean, this is what the source said, and that's just one of many reports as we tried to put all the evidence out there for all of our collective minds to come to a conclusion on.
[01:14:19.152 --> 01:14:20.634]  What about the larger issue?
[01:14:21.974 --> 01:14:24.296]  I mean, Traffic Hand Off Air was going, hey, what about Austin?
[01:14:24.316 --> 01:14:24.777]  You're down there.
[01:14:24.797 --> 01:14:25.597]  This guy was fed up.
[01:14:25.878 --> 01:14:26.498]  We're sick of it.
[01:14:26.518 --> 01:14:28.340]  And then on air, he said similar things.
[01:14:28.861 --> 01:14:33.565]  A lot of people out there want to believe that he did it on his own, and they like it.
[01:14:34.085 --> 01:14:41.593]  And I think that overall is dangerous, because North Com and the Globalists normally bomb themselves as a pretext to crack down.
[01:14:42.213 --> 01:14:46.878]  And I mean, I just think we're making such inroads right now, peacefully,
[01:14:48.174 --> 01:14:55.315]  I don't know if targeting secretaries in an IRS building is a good idea, or a good thing, PR-wise.
[01:14:56.255 --> 01:14:57.176]  What's your take on that?
[01:14:58.116 --> 01:14:59.316]  I agree with you completely.
[01:14:59.976 --> 01:15:03.237]  And you know, we've preached this on all of the shows that we've been on.
[01:15:04.497 --> 01:15:13.759]  Don't get sucked into the vortex of the government getting you to do things that they would like to do themselves, but if you're dumb enough to do it, well, go ahead and do it.
[01:15:14.579 --> 01:15:16.219]  And so with that said,
[01:15:17.434 --> 01:15:23.458]  Uh, we don't want violence and I feel very bad that the man is now deceased.
[01:15:24.598 --> 01:15:28.681]  And, um, uh, there had to be another solution.
[01:15:28.761 --> 01:15:44.510]  I, I would say in retrospect, too bad somebody wasn't around who could have calmed him down and taken, uh, the ideas of, uh, of, uh, destroying himself and, and, uh, and in the process.
[01:15:45.109 --> 01:15:48.210]  Probably in killing, possibly killing innocent people.
[01:16:00.616 --> 01:16:00.696]  Yeah.
[01:16:31.977 --> 01:16:37.279]  Well, I also heard yesterday of someone who defended their home by using a sword.
[01:16:38.259 --> 01:16:44.342]  And so they'll have to start outlawing swords, and of course butcher knives, and just about everything.
[01:16:44.602 --> 01:16:48.803]  Well, Oklahoma just passed a law that you can't fortify your home with more than three deadbolts.
[01:16:49.084 --> 01:16:50.204]  You can't have burglar bars.
[01:16:50.244 --> 01:16:54.546]  They're now illegal because the criminal government wants in, and so do their little buddy criminals.
[01:16:56.406 --> 01:16:57.187]  Yeah, I saw that.
[01:16:58.889 --> 01:17:00.630]  They're going all the way, there's no question.
[01:17:01.791 --> 01:17:08.316]  And they're trying to draw us into this, and again, what you've said is very positive.
[01:17:09.097 --> 01:17:14.321]  Don't go out and commit suicide like this gentleman did.
[01:17:15.021 --> 01:17:19.624]  It's not a good idea, it's not good for you, and it's not good for what we're trying to accomplish.
[01:17:20.225 --> 01:17:24.168]  We want to get people like Jim Traffickant back into Congress.
[01:17:25.057 --> 01:17:30.079]  We want to get anybody into Congress except the people who are there, with minor exception.
[01:17:30.499 --> 01:17:35.462]  And goodness knows, you've heard me say this over the last couple of years on this program.
[01:17:36.802 --> 01:17:37.583]  We have to.
[01:17:38.243 --> 01:17:42.465]  We have to take Congress away from the people who are being paid off.
[01:17:42.985 --> 01:17:48.327]  If we can do that, we can get the Fed Reserve audited and then gotten rid of.
[01:17:49.008 --> 01:17:51.449]  We can get rid of executive orders.
[01:17:52.569 --> 01:18:00.014]  We can get rid of the Plunge Protection Team, which is a working group on financial markets, which is an executive order.
[01:18:00.394 --> 01:18:05.578]  We can get rid of campaign financing, and we can also get rid of lobbying.
[01:18:06.238 --> 01:18:12.622]  And in one fell swoop, in six to eight months, with the right Congress, we can accomplish all of that.
[01:18:12.642 --> 01:18:20.007]  And at the same time, we can make inroads to disbanding Homeland Security.
[01:18:21.516 --> 01:18:30.194]  Bob Chapman, with Ceausescu in Romania, or Stalin, or Hitler, or Mao, or any of these thugs and dictators, Pol Pot, pick your poison.
[01:18:32.113 --> 01:18:44.141]  I've seen a lot of police writing me letters, and they say, yeah, it's coming to the point where they're going to have to make decisions, and when government goes bad, it's no longer legitimate, and it's natural, God-given rights for people to defend themselves.
[01:18:44.782 --> 01:18:51.687]  And what I've been shocked by is the level of anger of the public cheering this guy on, and it's real, it's not provocateured.
[01:18:53.365 --> 01:19:08.354]  I wonder if the government, and I mean the minions that are going to be facing the true brunt of this, realize what 150 million gun owners, 16 million guns sold in the last year, 14 million last year, already more than 2 million this year, realize that if 1% of that 150 million decide to stand up and fight,
[01:19:11.016 --> 01:19:14.319]  That is 1.5 million people.
[01:19:14.859 --> 01:19:16.580]  I mean, that's unstoppable.
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:31.352]  Don't the globalists understand that they may have put us to sleep for a while, but those old American 1776 instincts are there, and that if the sleeping giant stands up and it's starting to get up, it's going to be devastating.
[01:19:31.392 --> 01:19:33.053]  I mean, it's going to be hell on earth.
[01:19:34.974 --> 01:19:36.816]  It's going to be cultural and tribal.
[01:19:39.115 --> 01:19:43.359]  450 million guns, 80 million veterans, 40 million that have been in combat.
[01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:48.023]  Don't anybody tangle with them if it comes to that.
[01:19:50.886 --> 01:19:51.666]  It's bad news.
[01:19:51.686 --> 01:19:53.648]  You know, the military puts up a line.
[01:19:53.668 --> 01:19:54.949]  We'll crush the American people.
[01:19:55.610 --> 01:19:58.753]  Folks, no one can stop a guerrilla army of this size.
[01:19:59.874 --> 01:20:04.157]  Is garlic the absolute best defense against the threat of bacterial and viral pandemics?
[01:20:04.498 --> 01:20:04.638]  No.
[01:20:07.119 --> 01:20:07.619]  We're good to go.
[01:20:07.659 --> 01:20:08.640]  We're good to go.
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:09.441]  We're good to go.
[01:20:23.323 --> 01:20:30.288]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:20:30.448 --> 01:20:34.851]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:20:35.012 --> 01:20:40.736]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[01:20:40.816 --> 01:20:44.218]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:20:44.458 --> 01:20:47.059]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:47.159 --> 01:20:52.080]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:52.980]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:57.041]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:00.762 --> 01:21:04.383]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:04.763 --> 01:21:07.784]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:08.024 --> 01:21:09.424]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:21:10.326 --> 01:21:12.809]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:21:13.569 --> 01:21:19.054]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:19.194 --> 01:21:24.259]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:21:24.399 --> 01:21:34.388]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:21:34.488 --> 01:21:36.609]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:38.170]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:38.431 --> 01:21:40.712]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:40.892 --> 01:21:42.734]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:21:43.014 --> 01:21:47.817]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:21:48.157 --> 01:21:57.283]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:01.833 --> 01:22:07.516]  As the economy continues to decline, Patriots across the nation are preparing for the worst.
[01:22:08.136 --> 01:22:09.957]  The world is changing fast.
[01:22:10.357 --> 01:22:11.818]  Are you fully prepared?
[01:22:12.598 --> 01:22:15.239]  Or will you be forced to eat government soup?
[01:22:15.779 --> 01:22:26.064]  At PatriotFood.com, we offer you 135 pounds of dehydrated food and six varieties of canned meat for half price.

[01:22:37.851 --> 01:22:42.134]  That's twice as many as our competition for the same price.
[01:22:42.714 --> 01:22:47.057]  PatriotFood.com and SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[01:22:47.338 --> 01:22:49.679]  Food insurance, just in case.
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:54.903]  Owned by me, Big John Lipston, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[01:22:59.147 --> 01:23:02.169]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:23:02.529 --> 01:23:06.132]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:23:06.432 --> 01:23:09.895]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:23:10.155 --> 01:23:17.460]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride and
[01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:17.780]  Yes, it is.
[01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:17.960]  It is.
[01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:18.160]  It is.
[01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:18.320]  It is.
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:18.520]  It is.
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:18.761]  It is.
[01:23:18.781 --> 01:23:18.941]  It is.
[01:23:18.961 --> 01:23:19.281]  It is.
[01:23:19.301 --> 01:23:19.421]  It is.

[01:24:07.557 --> 01:24:15.310]  We got Mike Rivero popping in for about 10 minutes with Bob Chapman on the Kamikaze attack and the latest developments to get his perspective.
[01:24:16.479 --> 01:24:18.159]  That I tend to agree with on a lot of fronts.
[01:24:18.219 --> 01:24:19.540]  Too early to tell right now, though.
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:21.120]  We're going to get his view coming up.
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:24.641]  Bob, right now, and then when Mike leaves us, we'll get back into the economy.
[01:24:25.201 --> 01:24:26.641]  What's going on with the economy?
[01:24:27.161 --> 01:24:30.302]  Months ago, you said they were going to target Greece and Spain.
[01:24:30.342 --> 01:24:31.122]  The word was out.
[01:24:31.242 --> 01:24:37.143]  Now, Reuters is reporting that the Spanish government is looking at this being coordinated by Goldman Sachs and others.
[01:24:37.203 --> 01:24:39.724]  Again, you hit the nail right on the head.
[01:24:39.784 --> 01:24:40.944]  What's going on with the dollar?
[01:24:41.204 --> 01:24:42.264]  Interest rates going up.
[01:24:42.744 --> 01:24:44.445]  What's happening with gold going back up?
[01:24:44.645 --> 01:24:45.465]  What do you see happening?
[01:24:46.698 --> 01:24:59.424]  Well first of all, I wrote about Goldman 10 years ago when Greece and Italy were trying to qualify and the term I used was, they're Mickey Mousing the books.
[01:25:00.444 --> 01:25:12.190]  And the rest of the Eurozone at that time, which today only makes up 16 of the 27 European Union members, they looked the other way.
[01:25:12.890 --> 01:25:14.971]  They wanted that union and so they got it.
[01:25:15.945 --> 01:25:18.026]  And those books have been phony all along.
[01:25:18.606 --> 01:25:23.689]  And as we have found out, it's been proven now that Goldman Sachs arranged the whole thing.
[01:25:25.450 --> 01:25:26.110]  Where's it going?
[01:25:26.730 --> 01:25:31.353]  I think it creates a sense of urgency now.
[01:25:32.293 --> 01:25:38.957]  I think things are starting to come unglued even more quickly than I had anticipated.
[01:25:39.177 --> 01:25:43.699]  I think there's a possibility that
[01:25:44.444 --> 01:25:54.526]  They may bring down a number of these countries' sovereign debt prior to the election, and it may include the United States.
[01:25:55.427 --> 01:25:57.907]  And if they do that, there may not be an election.
[01:25:58.407 --> 01:26:07.670]  Now I'm not saying that's going to happen, and I don't want to give these people any ideas, but that would be the perfect thing to do to get control.
[01:26:08.970 --> 01:26:10.170]  And so that's possible.
[01:26:10.990 --> 01:26:13.011]  Whether it's probable, I don't know at this point.
[01:26:13.593 --> 01:26:16.274]  But there are a number of countries that are on the edge.
[01:26:16.755 --> 01:26:25.639]  We've got Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Greece, which we know about.
[01:26:26.219 --> 01:26:31.662]  And then nobody ever hears about Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania.
[01:26:34.431 --> 01:26:43.455]  Romania, Hungary, Poland... And that will send debt shockwaves a lot bigger than the housing bubble throughout the planet.
[01:26:43.495 --> 01:26:47.816]  Meanwhile, the Chinese are already moving and dumping their U.S.T.
[01:26:47.856 --> 01:26:48.116]  bills.
[01:26:49.557 --> 01:26:50.197]  That's correct.
[01:26:50.777 --> 01:26:53.118]  And even Denmark's having problems, of course.
[01:26:53.538 --> 01:26:58.380]  The two worst, really, for their size, is Great Britain and the United States.
[01:26:59.161 --> 01:27:02.402]  Now, I think what government wanted to do
[01:27:03.443 --> 01:27:32.198]  Or those behind government wanted to do is after the election start these things going by taking all of these countries to the edge and then having a meeting like they did with Smithsonian and the Plaza Accord and the Louvre Accords and revalue, devalue currencies and have a debt default between nations and everybody falls off a cliff together and we have
[01:27:33.088 --> 01:27:59.624]  Everybody devaluing their currencies, or most everybody, and then we go into a deflationary depression, which they want to, from behind the scenes, people like Goldman and Morgan and Citigroup and all of those people and the Bilderbergers and all those groups, they would then try to suppress the people of the world, quote, legally, while they were on their knees financially and economically.
[01:27:59.997 --> 01:28:00.697]  Let's expand.
[01:28:00.757 --> 01:28:01.837]  Let's expand on that.
[01:28:02.878 --> 01:28:10.199]  We now see open discussions of devaluation of the dollar.
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:21.662]  And we also, as you talked about last week, they're talking about coming in and taking people's pension funds, the government taking over people's pension funds, then paying you part of it back.
[01:28:22.122 --> 01:28:25.183]  The neocons are pushing for new taxes as if that's a good thing.
[01:28:27.734 --> 01:28:30.397]  No, I don't think taxes are the answer.
[01:28:31.058 --> 01:28:37.024]  The real answer is to cut government spending all over the country, not just in Washington.
[01:28:37.045 --> 01:28:40.568]  I mean, let's cut it by 50%.
[01:28:41.429 --> 01:28:44.032]  So you've got to lay off 30% of your employees?
[01:28:44.072 --> 01:28:44.993]  Well, that's too bad.
[01:28:45.934 --> 01:28:48.057]  This is really the solution, purging.
[01:28:49.125 --> 01:28:56.110]  All of those banks and insurance companies and brokerage firms and transnational conglomerates... And let's explain that, though.
[01:28:56.550 --> 01:29:00.773]  All the studies show one government job costs two private sectors.
[01:29:00.793 --> 01:29:09.479]  So you get rid of the government jobs, a lot of them, then you get two jobs back for every job you get rid of there, and people have their own tax money.
[01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:10.200]  That would fix it.
[01:29:12.422 --> 01:29:15.163]  It's going to happen sooner or later, and they know it.
[01:29:15.624 --> 01:29:18.566]  They want it on their terms so they can control it.
[01:29:19.258 --> 01:29:22.919]  So they can make people do what they want to do under those circumstances.
[01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:41.646]  And that's why all the things that you talk about in regard to what's going on in America about Homeland Security and you can't put bars in your windows and all of these things, that is because they know the public is going to be
[01:29:42.708 --> 01:29:45.872]  Very, very disturbed about all this, and who knows what they'll do.
[01:29:46.192 --> 01:29:46.653]  Stay there.
[01:29:46.713 --> 01:29:48.555]  Bob Chapman, our guest, straight ahead.
[01:29:48.615 --> 01:29:49.797]  Joining us, Mike Rivera.
[01:29:50.037 --> 01:29:50.958]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.438 --> 01:29:53.040]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.981 --> 01:29:56.645]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.110 --> 01:30:05.953]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:30:06.074 --> 01:30:07.314]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:30:07.354 --> 01:30:08.014]  It's very real.
[01:30:08.175 --> 01:30:10.296]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:30:10.416 --> 01:30:11.936]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:30:12.056 --> 01:30:16.379]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[01:30:16.539 --> 01:30:18.920]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[01:30:46.892 --> 01:30:48.813]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:30:58.777 --> 01:31:03.021]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:03.321 --> 01:31:07.405]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:07.665 --> 01:31:13.091]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:13.431 --> 01:31:18.716]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:19.036 --> 01:31:19.577]  Number 3.
[01:31:19.857 --> 01:31:23.139]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:27.163]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:27.363 --> 01:31:27.903]  Number 4.
[01:31:28.144 --> 01:31:30.526]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:30.926 --> 01:31:34.309]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:34.589 --> 01:31:34.809]  Number 5.
[01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:39.313]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:39.533 --> 01:31:44.297]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:44.577 --> 01:31:48.601]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:31:59.246 --> 01:32:01.848]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:02.248 --> 01:32:07.211]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:07.572 --> 01:32:09.313]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:09.633 --> 01:32:14.436]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:14.636 --> 01:32:15.597]  How much do you want?
[01:32:15.817 --> 01:32:16.557]  When do you want it?
[01:32:16.938 --> 01:32:18.539]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:18.819 --> 01:32:19.639]  When will you need it?
[01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:21.961]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:22.101 --> 01:32:23.202]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:23.442 --> 01:32:24.743]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:25.043 --> 01:32:30.026]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:30.206 --> 01:32:33.408]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:33.809 --> 01:32:37.311]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:37.631 --> 01:32:38.612]  How much will you need?
[01:32:38.852 --> 01:32:39.452]  We don't know.
[01:32:39.752 --> 01:32:40.673]  How much do you want?
[01:32:40.853 --> 01:32:41.593]  All you can get.
[01:32:41.794 --> 01:32:42.474]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:42.874 --> 01:32:45.636]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:32:45.916 --> 01:32:49.037]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:32:49.057 --> 01:32:50.158]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:32:50.198 --> 01:32:53.100]  No one knows what it's like to be the bad man, to be the sad man.
[01:33:13.674 --> 01:33:17.736]  We had James Traficant on for the entire second hour of the show today.
[01:33:17.796 --> 01:33:21.079]  That'll be on the free podcast served up at the end of the show.
[01:33:21.139 --> 01:33:25.481]  It'll be reposted in higher quality at PrisonPlanet.tv for members.
[01:33:26.382 --> 01:33:28.984]  A huge interview, a news-making interview.
[01:33:29.124 --> 01:33:30.525]  What incredible courage he's got.
[01:33:30.885 --> 01:33:32.906]  That's why we're standing beside him and behind him here.
[01:33:33.847 --> 01:33:39.691]  So that is coming up in an hour and 27 minutes when the official live radio broadcast ends.
[01:33:41.289 --> 01:33:44.972]  Of course, I'll also be back live this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:44.992 --> 01:33:49.374]  Don't forget the free iTunes application.
[01:33:49.434 --> 01:33:54.037]  It's got five stars, hundreds and hundreds of ratings on iTunes as we launched it a week ago.
[01:33:55.455 --> 01:33:57.555]  What is it, like 10,000 plus downloads of it?
[01:33:57.575 --> 01:33:58.616]  It needs to be a lot more than that.
[01:33:59.016 --> 01:34:00.376]  It's absolutely free.
[01:34:00.416 --> 01:34:03.497]  Tell your friends and family that have iPhones or Apple about it.
[01:34:04.197 --> 01:34:04.997]  It's a great system.
[01:34:05.037 --> 01:34:08.878]  It streams a lot better than some of the other free systems that have our show or it's in larger listings.
[01:34:09.178 --> 01:34:11.958]  We do have other things like Flycast that have the show.
[01:34:11.998 --> 01:34:13.818]  We have links to where you can find us there.
[01:34:14.179 --> 01:34:17.499]  That's all at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:34:17.819 --> 01:34:21.480]  Now, we're going to go back in the economy here in about 10 minutes, but Mike Rivera has been kind enough
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:27.623]  To join us, because again, this building got hit at about 955 Central.
[01:34:27.703 --> 01:34:30.325]  I learned about it at about 1030 when I got into work.
[01:34:30.905 --> 01:34:32.066]  And we've been all over the map.
[01:34:32.086 --> 01:34:36.288]  Before they said Tea Party, before they tried to blame it, I said it's a government building.
[01:34:36.609 --> 01:34:37.929]  Watch them try to blame it on the Tea Party.
[01:34:37.969 --> 01:34:38.650]  I was right about that.
[01:34:39.278 --> 01:34:43.541]  Then we have a source that said the FBI was dispatched into Austin about a threat to a government building.
[01:34:44.262 --> 01:34:47.324]  They don't know specifically because it was another department.
[01:34:47.344 --> 01:34:48.925]  They just saw it and then saw them leave.
[01:34:49.745 --> 01:34:50.726]  Could that be something else?
[01:34:51.186 --> 01:34:51.587]  Who knows?
[01:34:51.607 --> 01:34:57.431]  But we know we've played the KXAN piece where the woman said, I saw the emergency vehicles out here beforehand.
[01:34:57.511 --> 01:35:01.234]  I talked to multiple listeners who called in and we've talked to some of them off-air.
[01:35:02.134 --> 01:35:02.874]  I don't
[01:35:19.465 --> 01:35:20.826]  Did they know a threat was coming?
[01:35:20.846 --> 01:35:21.547]  They weren't sure?
[01:35:21.587 --> 01:35:22.328]  Were they on alert?
[01:35:22.368 --> 01:35:26.591]  They were having terror drills the day before with FEMA and Homeland Security and the City of Austin.
[01:35:26.631 --> 01:35:28.473]  In fact, bring me that City of Austin document.
[01:35:28.493 --> 01:35:29.654]  I forgot and left it in there.
[01:35:29.874 --> 01:35:35.439]  So we don't know what's going on, but Bob Chapman seems to think this was just somebody fed up.
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:37.421]  Trafficants leaning towards that.
[01:35:37.781 --> 01:35:39.503]  And I wasn't leaning really towards that.
[01:35:39.523 --> 01:35:40.183]  I wasn't sure.
[01:35:40.203 --> 01:35:41.524]  We were looking at everything until
[01:35:43.004 --> 01:35:51.348]  I began to notice, and I noticed that Rivero also, because he's worked with the media, he recognized this, that real terror attacks, or real attacks against government, they tend to ignore.
[01:35:51.749 --> 01:35:55.711]  This was so big they couldn't ignore it, but that suddenly it kind of left the news cycle today.
[01:35:56.151 --> 01:35:56.731]  It was gone.
[01:35:57.352 --> 01:36:01.654]  With the underwear bomber we know was staged, it never left the news cycle, and they had something they were pushing.
[01:36:01.894 --> 01:36:04.515]  Like they're staging fake cyber attacks right now to get through the Senate.
[01:36:04.816 --> 01:36:06.156]  No doubt that's fake and staged.
[01:36:06.597 --> 01:36:07.197]  So I wanted to get
[01:36:07.657 --> 01:36:13.103]  Mike Rivero's take on what he thinks going on here and then pop back in with Bob Chapman who's with us as well right now.
[01:36:14.385 --> 01:36:16.827]  Mike Rivero joining us via video Skype from Hawaii.
[01:36:17.468 --> 01:36:18.309]  Good to have you here with us.
[01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:21.072]  Thanks an awful lot for having me on your show, Alex.
[01:36:21.813 --> 01:36:26.819]  Okay, give us your bottom line on with all the evidence this early on we're not sure but what you think's going on.
[01:36:27.639 --> 01:36:32.422]  Well, I'm definitely leaning toward thinking this was a genuine, spontaneous action by this gentleman.
[01:36:33.723 --> 01:36:38.667]  He's just an ordinary working American and he got pushed to his limit and he snapped and we all have a breaking point.
[01:36:39.287 --> 01:36:46.753]  And I think the media was attempting to spin this to make him look like a demon and a bad guy and then when that really wasn't working,
[01:36:47.393 --> 01:36:53.297]  My concern was that the media was going to try and pull away the focus as quickly as possible, which, as you point out, they're doing today.
[01:36:53.337 --> 01:36:54.858]  It's all Tiger Woods all the time.
[01:36:55.418 --> 01:37:05.304]  And I think what's in there is we need to understand that from the point of view of the government and the media, their big priority right now, they don't want people actually reading this guy's suicide note.
[01:37:05.524 --> 01:37:08.506]  They're calling it a manifesto to make it sound like it's a bad thing.
[01:37:08.786 --> 01:37:10.867]  Because the commies had a manifesto.
[01:37:11.268 --> 01:37:13.069]  And the Unabomber had a manifesto.
[01:37:13.109 --> 01:37:15.130]  So this is a manifesto and you shouldn't go read it.
[01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:20.832]  But everybody who's actually read this suicide note, nobody condones what Joe Stack did.
[01:37:21.233 --> 01:37:24.734]  But everybody seems to say, I understand why he did it.
[01:37:25.094 --> 01:37:27.055]  We are all at that breaking point.
[01:37:27.295 --> 01:37:36.059]  We're seeing the work of a lifetime being taken away from us, you know, under threat of force, spent on wars, spent on corruption, spent on Israel.
[01:37:36.119 --> 01:37:39.181]  And much of Congress and Geithner and the White House don't even pay taxes.
[01:37:39.821 --> 01:37:40.902]  That's exactly right.
[01:37:41.082 --> 01:37:43.423]  That's further annoying a lot of people.
[01:37:43.583 --> 01:37:48.405]  And we've got callers into our show from people who've been thrown out of their homes by the IRS.
[01:37:49.045 --> 01:37:50.906]  A woman called into the show.
[01:37:50.966 --> 01:37:55.548]  Her veteran husband had been neglected by the VA for nine months, came down with cancer.
[01:37:55.848 --> 01:37:58.229]  The week he died, the IRS took her bank accounts.
[01:37:58.609 --> 01:38:00.290]  It's just a horrific story out there.
[01:38:00.510 --> 01:38:03.031]  And everybody understands what this guy was feeling.
[01:38:03.051 --> 01:38:05.572]  They don't agree with what he did, but they understand where
[01:38:05.612 --> 01:38:24.786]  That's right, it was bad enough, it was bad enough with the IRS outside the law, no due process, robbing everybody before for the private Federal Reserve, but now everybody's starting to go bankrupt, or on the edge of bankrupt, and they don't even have money for gas or food, and now the government's taking the house, the only thing they've got, or their little bank account with 500 bucks in it.
[01:38:25.046 --> 01:38:32.071]  Here's Rasmussen last week, 75% of Americans are angry at government current policies, and you know that's a low number.
[01:38:32.171 --> 01:38:32.772]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:38:33.444 --> 01:38:34.085]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:38:34.145 --> 01:38:37.448]  Most people are still trying to be polite and say, yes, I'm a loyal American.
[01:38:37.928 --> 01:38:41.731]  And there was a survey they did about, is it okay to cheat on your taxes?
[01:38:42.012 --> 01:38:47.777]  And I expect probably most people lied on that one as well because they're afraid of, you know, they're afraid of the IRS.
[01:38:47.817 --> 01:38:50.780]  The IRS is the instrument of terror in our society.
[01:38:51.580 --> 01:39:00.732]  And again, nobody's condoning what Joe Stack did, but everybody who has written into my show or called into my show, they understand why he did it.
[01:39:00.832 --> 01:39:05.578]  I have not heard a single word of sympathy from anybody regarding the IRS in this affair.
[01:39:06.239 --> 01:39:09.023]  Talking to you this morning on the phone, you were saying the government's scared.
[01:39:10.086 --> 01:39:10.346]  Yes.
[01:39:11.087 --> 01:39:11.787]  Absolutely.
[01:39:12.288 --> 01:39:17.072]  Because if there's one thing that Joe Stack has accomplished, it's kind of in a positive sense.
[01:39:17.592 --> 01:39:21.856]  It has made the abuses of the IRS acceptable in polite conversation.
[01:39:22.156 --> 01:39:26.059]  People are now willing to talk about how many of them are in serious trouble with the IRS.
[01:39:26.319 --> 01:39:30.082]  You've seen the flood of TV commercials for all these tax resolution services.
[01:39:30.583 --> 01:39:34.666]  You know, that alone tells you that most of Americans are in some kind of tax trouble.
[01:39:35.046 --> 01:39:38.049]  And now, because of Joe, it's okay to talk about it.
[01:39:38.129 --> 01:39:40.291]  It's okay to talk about the abuses of the IRS.
[01:39:40.571 --> 01:39:44.975]  People are even now openly talking about, was the 16th Amendment actually ratified?
[01:39:45.275 --> 01:39:47.557]  Are the taxes illegal right from the start?
[01:39:47.617 --> 01:39:59.027]  I understand Jim Traficante, and by the way, please give him my highest regards when you have him on the show, he's talking about if he gets elected back to Congress, he wants to kick the IRS in a very sensitive portion of the genitalia.
[01:39:59.447 --> 01:40:02.650]  So, and I think most Americans are going to sign up with him on that.
[01:40:05.856 --> 01:40:09.297]  In your mind, is there any way this could have been an inside job?
[01:40:09.357 --> 01:40:11.718]  Because, you know, we know they can remote control aircraft.
[01:40:12.538 --> 01:40:14.819]  We know that they were out there beforehand.
[01:40:14.919 --> 01:40:16.019]  Something was going on.
[01:40:16.899 --> 01:40:18.580]  We know the underwear bomber was staged.
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:19.680]  I mean, this is the season.
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:21.381]  I've been predicting an attack in Austin.
[01:40:21.801 --> 01:40:25.323]  From the activities I've been seeing, they need to demonize the Tea Parties.
[01:40:25.363 --> 01:40:30.046]  They certainly jumped on this within three hours of it happening, and I predicted they wouldn't have said the Tea Parties.
[01:40:30.386 --> 01:40:32.027]  I mean, here's the New York Daily News.
[01:40:32.287 --> 01:40:36.589]  Kamikaze pilot Joe Stack crashed plane into Austin building, hailed by anti-government groups.
[01:40:36.889 --> 01:40:38.870]  And they say in here that I'm hailing it.
[01:40:39.491 --> 01:40:46.855]  Austin American Statesman, in an article, social media speeds up news gathering and plane crash aftermath, says that I was hailing the attack.
[01:40:47.935 --> 01:40:50.157]  I was saying maybe staged, or we don't know.
[01:40:51.338 --> 01:40:53.580]  So, I'm being singled out here.
[01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:56.282]  They're certainly trying to put this on us.
[01:40:57.203 --> 01:41:01.686]  Well, they're putting it on you, they're putting it on Glenn Beck, they're putting it on me, they're putting it on Rush Limbaugh.
[01:41:01.706 --> 01:41:04.789]  They're looking to basically take the focus off the letter.
[01:41:05.289 --> 01:41:12.055]  As for the exact nature of it, I'm 95% convinced it was a genuine, spontaneous act by this gentleman.
[01:41:13.036 --> 01:41:21.402]  If it was a false flag attack, it's a very poorly thought out one, because the patsies that are supposed to be framed for it, it's not a very good case.
[01:41:21.502 --> 01:41:31.570]  And in this case, back when the Oklahoma City bomb went off, and little kids were being killed, and everybody was shocked and said, oh, this is a terrible thing, they're not getting that reaction here.
[01:41:31.851 --> 01:41:36.995]  The attitude of most of America is, well, yeah, it's a bad thing, but, you know, maybe they sort of-
[01:41:37.295 --> 01:41:38.676]  Claire, you've done the research.
[01:41:38.736 --> 01:41:40.277]  Oklahoma City, inside job.
[01:41:40.677 --> 01:41:42.098]  Underwear bomber, inside job.
[01:41:42.118 --> 01:41:43.719]  9-11, inside job.
[01:41:44.099 --> 01:41:45.760]  Operation Ajax, inside job.
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:47.241]  Gulf of Tonkin, inside job.
[01:41:47.541 --> 01:41:49.162]  Operation Northwoods, inside job.
[01:41:49.442 --> 01:41:51.984]  No, Gulf of Tonkin was not an inside job.
[01:41:52.084 --> 01:41:55.085]  It was a deliberate misinterpretation of the available information.
[01:41:55.786 --> 01:42:02.030]  But that is still an inside job to say you've been attacked and it's made up as a pretext for war.
[01:42:02.050 --> 01:42:04.111]  What I'm saying is staged provocation.
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:09.142]  Well, definitely a lot of propaganda and a lot of lying and misstatement.
[01:42:09.182 --> 01:42:10.643]  You know, there were no torpedoes there.
[01:42:10.923 --> 01:42:21.149]  But in the case of yesterday's attack, I think they were trying to take something that happened genuinely and attempt to use it for propaganda purposes, and they didn't get the traction with it.
[01:42:21.450 --> 01:42:25.452]  It just doesn't feel like it was planned or known about ahead of time.
[01:42:25.752 --> 01:42:29.294]  They just tried to take advantage of it, and they didn't really get it to work.
[01:42:29.354 --> 01:42:30.415]  That's what it feels like to me.
[01:42:31.475 --> 01:42:32.696]  Let's bring Bob Chapman in.
[01:42:32.736 --> 01:42:33.957]  Bob, your comments on this.
[01:42:35.987 --> 01:42:42.209]  Well, first of all, I think it could, unfortunately, bring about other such events.
[01:42:43.210 --> 01:42:48.772]  And for all of you who are listening out there, please keep your cool.
[01:42:49.792 --> 01:42:52.213]  Talk to somebody about a problem.
[01:42:53.014 --> 01:42:55.355]  I mean, everybody out there has got problems now.
[01:42:55.455 --> 01:42:56.535]  Some are worse than others.
[01:42:57.695 --> 01:43:02.257]  I know it's compelling when you lose everything you have.
[01:43:04.685 --> 01:43:19.277]  We have a society that we shouldn't be running around killing ourselves, and usually the only people who do that are people who become unbalanced, and there are reasons for that.
[01:43:20.017 --> 01:43:24.681]  But the point is, don't let this get you carried away.
[01:43:25.502 --> 01:43:31.707]  Secondly, in the International Forecaster, I guess it was two issues back, maybe three,
[01:43:35.584 --> 01:43:42.086]  I had a piece in there about Remington taking an order, and I can't remember how many.
[01:43:42.106 --> 01:43:44.387]  It was shotguns for the IRS.
[01:43:45.207 --> 01:43:47.287]  Yeah, these are sawed-off shotguns.
[01:43:47.628 --> 01:43:48.448]  Yeah.
[01:43:48.468 --> 01:43:51.469]  I mean, 14 inches is a sawed-off shotgun.
[01:43:52.669 --> 01:43:59.231]  And I think that the IRS obviously is terrified that people are going to
[01:44:00.174 --> 01:44:01.214]  React against them.
[01:44:01.435 --> 01:44:09.038]  Yeah, for those that don't know, a sawed-off is generally defensive, so people that don't know what they're doing can just aim in a general direction when you're getting rushed.
[01:44:10.639 --> 01:44:11.179]  Exactly.
[01:44:11.419 --> 01:44:14.620]  And the legal limit on the shotgun barrel is 18.
[01:44:15.220 --> 01:44:16.481]  And that's what a riot gun is.
[01:44:17.061 --> 01:44:19.842]  Yeah, so the IRS gets to have illegal shotguns.
[01:44:20.723 --> 01:44:21.183]  That's right.
[01:44:21.703 --> 01:44:25.225]  Well, it's obviously legal for them, but illegal for us.
[01:44:25.725 --> 01:44:27.926]  And like so often, we have two sets of rules.
[01:44:28.743 --> 01:44:34.648]  But I agree with what Mike had to say, and very well said.
[01:44:35.429 --> 01:44:37.311]  And you as well, Alex.
[01:44:37.992 --> 01:44:46.900]  And I think, unless something else pops up, I think it was an act of utter frustration.
[01:44:48.401 --> 01:44:49.222]  What am I going to do?
[01:44:49.322 --> 01:44:50.383]  I worked my whole life.
[01:44:51.082 --> 01:44:52.964]  And I may as well make a statement.
[01:45:10.598 --> 01:45:14.059]  Violence, cops are being caught robbing banks and raping people.
[01:45:14.479 --> 01:45:18.601]  I mean, statistically, crime but also craziness is way up.
[01:45:18.641 --> 01:45:23.303]  And a lot of times it's by government because they're under stress and a lot of them have a bullying psychology.
[01:45:24.063 --> 01:45:27.164]  And you've got citizens being pressed and squeezed and driven into a corner.
[01:45:27.624 --> 01:45:32.306]  No doubt, just like if our government attacks Iran, we're not going to have to see stage terror.
[01:45:32.566 --> 01:45:33.746]  Iran will defend itself.
[01:45:33.806 --> 01:45:34.727]  It will be called terror.
[01:45:35.327 --> 01:45:42.217]  Just like as the government squeezes, they know they're going to force people to finally stand up, and they're going to call that terrorism.
[01:45:42.477 --> 01:45:44.220]  How do you see this unfolding, Mike Rivera?
[01:45:46.505 --> 01:45:52.128]  Fading away from the public consciousness, although Joe Stack is already sort of a cult hero in a lot of places.
[01:45:52.148 --> 01:45:54.409]  He's got a lot of Facebook fan clubs springing up.
[01:45:54.989 --> 01:45:57.811]  There's nothing new with attacks against the IRS.
[01:45:57.951 --> 01:46:09.337]  Generally, they tend not to be reported, but because of the high visibility of the plane crash into the building and the subsequent release of the suicide note on the internet, this one did get out there and it had to be dealt with.
[01:46:09.837 --> 01:46:14.981]  Uh, but there have been attacks against IRS facilities and people before and no doubt it will continue into the future.
[01:46:15.301 --> 01:46:16.862]  I'm in agreement with your other guest.
[01:46:17.242 --> 01:46:31.852]  You know, this is not a call to arms to go out and start attacking the tax people because that would just give the government the justification it needs to suspend the Bill of Rights and really become the bullying dictators that they, that we all know they secretly lust to be.
[01:46:31.952 --> 01:46:36.353]  And I don't want that to happen, but I think that'd be a miscalculation by the establishment as well.
[01:46:36.713 --> 01:46:42.754]  I think them bringing the tyranny more out in the open and getting more confrontational will only make things blow up quicker.
[01:46:42.774 --> 01:46:44.915]  So this is like a Mexican standoff.
[01:46:45.675 --> 01:46:46.415]  I agree with you.
[01:46:46.475 --> 01:46:52.096]  I mean, we have the saying around here, the fastest way to bring down a dictator is to force them to act like one where everybody can see it.
[01:46:52.417 --> 01:46:58.938]  I just don't want to see the kind of Kent State bloodshed, you know, that this kind of a process usually entails.
[01:47:01.770 --> 01:47:02.330]  Absolutely.
[01:47:02.370 --> 01:47:03.631]  Well, Mike, thanks for joining us.
[01:47:03.651 --> 01:47:05.252]  WhatReallyHappened.com is a great site.
[01:47:05.272 --> 01:47:06.273]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:47:06.853 --> 01:47:07.554]  Thanks an awful lot.
[01:47:07.574 --> 01:47:08.194]  Look forward to it.
[01:47:08.214 --> 01:47:08.714]  All right.
[01:47:08.754 --> 01:47:09.475]  There goes Mike.
[01:47:10.415 --> 01:47:12.277]  Anything else you want to add on the plane situation?
[01:47:12.297 --> 01:47:14.898]  I'll be recapping the latest developments in the next hour.
[01:47:15.238 --> 01:47:19.261]  I am open on this, because I've been predicting an attack in Austin.
[01:47:20.202 --> 01:47:26.686]  I've seen Glenn Beck now come out and put on his little blackboard, slash magnet refrigerator board,
[01:47:27.606 --> 01:47:29.828]  It's really what it is, but it looks like a blackboard.
[01:47:30.309 --> 01:47:32.211]  Deborah Medina next to Van Jones.
[01:47:33.071 --> 01:47:34.973]  And he said, these people hate America.
[01:47:35.454 --> 01:47:39.157]  Then he did a weird PSYOP where he said, well, I'm in trouble in Texas with my listeners.
[01:47:40.086 --> 01:47:43.608]  He's lost 500,000 viewers conservatively according to Nielsen.
[01:47:44.429 --> 01:47:49.833]  His radio numbers, we'll find out later, earlier next month, those come out once a month.
[01:47:50.613 --> 01:47:54.196]  But his websites, anywhere people can comment, he's being shredded everywhere.
[01:47:54.216 --> 01:47:58.379]  He does this basic psychology where he puts up a picture of a
[01:47:59.399 --> 01:48:09.281]  Van Jones, and then some other Weatherman bombers next to him, and then sticks Medina up, and then Alan Keyes of all people, and says, these people are dangerous.
[01:48:09.321 --> 01:48:10.341]  They hate America.
[01:48:11.081 --> 01:48:22.484]  And he's not just saying 9-11 truthers are going to stage terror attacks, but he's now saying the birthers are the most dangerous, that these are the most dangerous, when in polls that's more than half of registered Republicans.
[01:48:23.124 --> 01:48:23.684]  So he's like,
[01:48:24.634 --> 01:48:25.034]  I don't
[01:48:44.162 --> 01:48:45.142]  This may be staged.
[01:48:45.403 --> 01:48:49.544]  They have psych warfare experts that knew people are angry, may make him a hero.
[01:48:49.564 --> 01:48:53.546]  I think the jury's out on this.
[01:48:53.666 --> 01:48:57.247]  I'm saying we should look at everything, but I'm just not sure.
[01:48:57.567 --> 01:48:59.928]  But then the media quit covering it today.
[01:49:00.368 --> 01:49:05.150]  We know if it was staged they'd be hyping it, but maybe it wasn't going like they wanted, so they pulled back.
[01:49:05.190 --> 01:49:08.091]  What do you think, Bob?
[01:49:08.232 --> 01:49:09.792]  I think we've just got to wait and see.
[01:49:13.175 --> 01:49:15.577]  They're always looking for another Horst Wessel.
[01:49:16.858 --> 01:49:24.904]  He was the young street tough who was in the brown shirts who was killed in clashes with the communists in Germany.
[01:49:25.644 --> 01:49:28.627]  And the Nazis made him into an ideal.
[01:49:29.187 --> 01:49:35.492]  In fact, they had the Horst Wessel lied, which is the song of Horst Wessel.
[01:49:35.832 --> 01:49:38.974]  And we don't want that to happen.
[01:49:39.915 --> 01:49:42.457]  We don't want someone to come along
[01:49:43.317 --> 01:49:56.541]  Who is going to be cited by the government in doing these kinds of things so that they can move against people who agree with him, whether it's Joe Stack or somebody else.
[01:49:57.482 --> 01:49:58.722]  And we've got to stay away from that.
[01:49:59.022 --> 01:50:03.024]  You know, we're doing very well doing what we're doing.
[01:50:03.704 --> 01:50:05.044]  And this is very important.
[01:50:06.005 --> 01:50:08.365]  I saw a figure, and you quoted some, 8%
[01:50:11.684 --> 01:50:17.609]  of the public, voting public, want to bring back their congressman or senator.
[01:50:18.910 --> 01:50:20.391]  Now that is astounding.
[01:50:22.012 --> 01:50:25.795]  I mean that means 92% want their people out of office.
[01:50:27.096 --> 01:50:27.957]  Yeah, I've seen that number.
[01:50:27.977 --> 01:50:32.781]  It is so powerful, it is so good, we don't want to lose that momentum.
[01:50:33.948 --> 01:50:39.330]  We want them all out of there so we can get the legislation legally that we need.
[01:50:39.790 --> 01:50:46.453]  And we want to take the states back, which is why Deborah Medina getting elected is so important, to send that message.
[01:50:46.553 --> 01:50:47.693]  Bob Chapman, stay there.
[01:50:48.393 --> 01:50:52.075]  Coming up in the next hour, I'm going to open the phones up, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:50:52.555 --> 01:50:59.738]  And we're going to have Rob Dew in our office, who knew Joe Stack, in studio, in the end.
[01:50:59.798 --> 01:51:01.378]  You may be new to freeze-dry foods.

[01:51:08.263 --> 01:51:09.864]  Welcome to the Freeze-Dry Guy.
[01:51:10.044 --> 01:51:12.366]  Okay, actually, we're more than just one guy.
[01:51:12.466 --> 01:51:15.289]  We're a California-based company that's been serving our U.S.

[01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:51.190]  FreezDryGuy.
[01:51:51.210 --> 01:51:51.870]  The best you can buy.
[01:52:00.806 --> 01:52:04.450]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:52:04.830 --> 01:52:07.833]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:52:08.073 --> 01:52:09.475]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:52:10.197 --> 01:52:12.860]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:19.106]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:52:19.266 --> 01:52:24.290]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:52:24.451 --> 01:52:34.440]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:36.661]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:52:36.901 --> 01:52:38.221]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:52:38.481 --> 01:52:40.762]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:52:40.942 --> 01:52:42.782]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:52:42.802 --> 01:52:47.884]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:52:48.204 --> 01:52:57.327]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:52:59.486 --> 01:53:02.768]  Money talks, and it sounds just like Jim Cramer.
[01:53:03.168 --> 01:53:03.808]  I'm Cramer.
[01:53:04.089 --> 01:53:08.891]  Money talks, and sometimes it shouts when the results speak for themselves.
[01:53:09.252 --> 01:53:15.795]  Investors worldwide follow Jim Cramer's advice on TV, in books, and on websites like thestreet.com.
[01:53:16.055 --> 01:53:20.278]  And whether the market's up, down, or sideways, Jim's always hunting down a bull market.

[01:53:58.558 --> 01:54:08.203]  We're going to have Rob Doo, new Joe Stack, in studio the last 20 minutes.
[01:54:09.924 --> 01:54:11.985]  Bob Chapman with us for a few more segments.
[01:54:12.932 --> 01:54:20.255]  We're going to open the phones up for a few questions for Bob coming up in the next segment or on any of these issues.
[01:54:20.275 --> 01:54:21.155]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:54:21.275 --> 01:54:27.377]  Now look, the media said a lot of different aircraft, but we have the tax records.
[01:54:28.097 --> 01:54:33.219]  It was a PA-28 Cherokee aircraft, a Piper.
[01:54:33.259 --> 01:54:34.520]  Is that a Piper?
[01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:37.381]  Registered owner, Stack Joseph A.
[01:54:38.502 --> 01:54:38.862]  Okay?
[01:54:39.503 --> 01:54:40.364]  That's the aircraft.
[01:54:40.864 --> 01:54:44.227]  The media was saying this Cirrus aircraft.
[01:54:44.247 --> 01:54:45.188]  That's not what it is.
[01:54:45.568 --> 01:54:48.210]  Now, here's the Texas Division of Emergency Management document.
[01:54:48.230 --> 01:54:49.811]  Give me a document cam shot on this, guys.
[01:54:50.352 --> 01:54:57.518]  Texas Division of Emergency Management, fiscal year 2010, training calendar October 2009, September 2010.
[01:54:58.238 --> 01:54:59.179]  Here's February.
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:06.125]  They were running all these different emergency, multi-hazard emergency planning drills and others.
[01:55:08.962 --> 01:55:15.584]  And all the drills ended on the 18th, yesterday.
[01:55:17.665 --> 01:55:19.345]  So maybe that's why those vehicles were out there.
[01:55:19.365 --> 01:55:21.366]  Maybe it was just part of a drill, or maybe not.
[01:55:21.466 --> 01:55:23.307]  They only run drills in association with this.
[01:55:24.407 --> 01:55:31.710]  Bob Chapman, going back to you, so much is happening with the economy separately.
[01:55:32.530 --> 01:55:35.971]  What happened with gold going down the last month, now surging up again?
[01:55:37.509 --> 01:55:38.930]  Well, I think that's a good question.
[01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:43.171]  And, you know, we've just had gold negative news, supposedly.
[01:55:43.972 --> 01:55:51.335]  First of all, the situation in Greece was, in the media, interpreted as being bad for gold.
[01:55:51.875 --> 01:55:54.776]  And of course, it really wasn't, because gold didn't go down.
[01:55:54.796 --> 01:55:59.538]  And then we had the IMF come out and said, well, we're going to sell some gold.
[01:56:00.318 --> 01:56:01.959]  And that turned out to be a non-event.
[01:56:02.651 --> 01:56:07.013]  And then, you know, higher interest rates has been touted as bad for gold.
[01:56:07.713 --> 01:56:09.454]  And gold went down and came back up again.
[01:56:10.075 --> 01:56:15.177]  And so gold seems to be impervious in here to the downside.
[01:56:15.857 --> 01:56:21.220]  And it's up $4.60 right now here in the late trading for the April month.
[01:56:22.060 --> 01:56:24.121]  And that'll go on for about another hour.
[01:56:25.422 --> 01:56:27.923]  The stocks are mixed to slightly weaker.
[01:56:27.943 --> 01:56:30.244]  And, you know, it's a Friday.
[01:56:30.324 --> 01:56:31.805]  People are evening up the books.
[01:56:32.589 --> 01:56:38.892]  And so it's hard to get a real read on it, but if I had to guess, I think gold will be up next week.
[01:56:39.932 --> 01:56:52.558]  And if it goes through 12-20-24 in that area, then we're going to very quickly see a move up toward $1,500 to $1,650.
[01:56:53.558 --> 01:57:00.181]  And if it doesn't happen by the beginning of April, it may very well happen before the end of the year.
[01:57:01.145 --> 01:57:11.248]  Although I think much more quickly, especially in view of what I said earlier about the problems being expedited.
[01:57:11.648 --> 01:57:27.092]  I don't think that Goldman Sachs ever thought that they would run into the buzzsaw that they're into right now because of their secret advice to these different nations and how to keep two sets of books.
[01:57:28.067 --> 01:57:34.589]  And of course, it's against the law, but that doesn't mean anything for the likes of Goldman, Morgan and Citi.
[01:57:34.629 --> 01:57:35.989]  I mean, these people are criminals.
[01:57:36.889 --> 01:57:38.830]  And I spent 28 years in Wall Street.
[01:57:38.850 --> 01:57:40.290]  I think I got a right to say that.
[01:57:42.631 --> 01:57:56.094]  And so I think that this is causing the alumnus behind the scenes to have to, even though they don't want to, expedite what they're doing.
[01:57:56.847 --> 01:57:59.009]  And every time you do that, you make mistakes.
[01:58:00.210 --> 01:58:06.795]  And I think by next year, all this thing's going to start coming down bad.
[01:58:07.496 --> 01:58:25.770]  And, you know, as I mentioned earlier, were they to bring it down in October, down being the sovereign nations defaulting simultaneously and having chaos within the financial world worldwide.
[01:58:26.420 --> 01:58:28.682]  We'd give them an excuse not to have an election.
[01:58:29.203 --> 01:58:30.004]  Bob, stay there.
[01:58:30.064 --> 01:58:32.006]  Let's come back and talk about that.
[01:58:32.606 --> 01:58:34.228]  Because that's quite an announcement from you.
[01:58:34.268 --> 01:58:36.770]  A year and a half ago, you saw the implosion in three years.
[01:58:37.171 --> 01:58:38.412]  Now you may be revising.

[01:59:54.429 --> 01:59:57.211]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:07.358 --> 02:00:11.221]  It is already the fourth and final hour of this Friday edition.
[02:00:12.122 --> 02:00:14.945]  Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com is our guest.
[02:00:14.985 --> 02:00:18.007]  I'm Alex Jones of M4Wars.com and PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:00:18.388 --> 02:00:25.454]  I want to say hi to all the great radio listeners out there and also the PrisonPlanet.TV viewers who are such key supporters of this radio show.
[02:00:25.794 --> 02:00:26.975]  You make it all possible!
[02:00:28.476 --> 02:00:31.579]  Now, Bob's going to be with us until 15 after.
[02:00:31.699 --> 02:00:33.841]  We're going to get more into the economy here in just a moment.
[02:00:35.455 --> 02:00:36.275]  Yeah, it's Alex in Vancouver.
[02:01:00.905 --> 02:01:04.689]  I've had the gut feeling they're going to do something at the Olympics for a long time now, maybe about a year.
[02:01:04.809 --> 02:01:08.633]  I've always said, you don't spend a billion dollars on security and then not stage a terror attack.
[02:01:09.294 --> 02:01:14.539]  And now on the heels of this, I really feel that they're stirring up 9-11 memories and everyone's thinking 9-11, 9-11.
[02:01:14.579 --> 02:01:16.881]  Well, they don't even have to say terrorism, but you're still thinking 9-11.
[02:01:18.337 --> 02:01:20.200]  Because it's a plane into a building, yes.
[02:01:20.220 --> 02:01:23.384]  And now it's in a Canadian newspaper, I meant to get to that, that they've caught police provocateurs again.
[02:01:35.194 --> 02:01:37.815]  They lost out two times on ammonium nitrate mysteriously.
[02:01:38.055 --> 02:01:40.676]  Now my big thing is I started thinking now, when are they going to do this?
[02:01:40.736 --> 02:01:47.098]  And what I came up with is February 22nd, 2-2-2, because we all know they love to use silly numbers.
[02:01:47.118 --> 02:01:48.018]  3-3-3, 7-7-7, 9-11.
[02:01:48.778 --> 02:01:57.261]  And that being three days away, this happening right before that, they're stirring everyone's thoughts up about terrorism, 9-11, 9-11, and all of a sudden on Monday morning, we'll see if I'm right or not, hopefully not.
[02:01:57.714 --> 02:01:59.915]  I've gone as far as to bet people money this is going to happen.
[02:01:59.955 --> 02:02:01.396]  Now I know that's kind of immoral.
[02:02:01.476 --> 02:02:04.557]  Well, I hope you're wrong, but Alex, I appreciate your call.
[02:02:04.577 --> 02:02:06.738]  Let's get a comment from Bob Chapman on that.
[02:02:09.559 --> 02:02:10.640]  We'll just have to see.
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:15.922]  You know, the possibility certainly exists and they are into numerology.
[02:02:16.802 --> 02:02:22.545]  And I'm surprised that something didn't happen in Vancouver.
[02:02:23.567 --> 02:02:29.992]  And I know people who I talk to all the time who live there and many of them, you know, many subscribers there.
[02:02:30.873 --> 02:02:35.637]  And they say that they've, uh, it's like a guarded camp.
[02:02:36.738 --> 02:02:40.681]  And, uh, you know, the Olympics haven't gone over that well.
[02:02:41.702 --> 02:02:48.027]  Uh, the American Idol is, uh, out pointing them, so to speak, which is rather surprising.
[02:02:48.968 --> 02:02:51.390]  And, uh, and it just hasn't drawn what
[02:02:52.734 --> 02:02:54.234]  The producers would have liked it to drop.
[02:02:54.274 --> 02:02:56.235]  Well, people are sick of police states.
[02:02:56.335 --> 02:02:59.395]  Most Europeans won't come here now because of the police state.
[02:03:00.716 --> 02:03:01.336]  Well, that's true.
[02:03:02.076 --> 02:03:09.177]  In fact, what's happening is that most Americans don't want to fly and only fly if they absolutely have to.
[02:03:09.917 --> 02:03:18.179]  And you can tell that because of the dropping amount of people who are using airplanes in America commercially.
[02:03:18.938 --> 02:03:23.638]  And the price of tickets continues to soar.
[02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:30.003]  They're up about, I would say, 40 to 50 percent over the last few years.
[02:03:30.403 --> 02:03:35.906]  But see, we have the head of NASA climate and the UN people and others saying they want to make us stop flying.
[02:03:36.166 --> 02:03:37.407]  They want us to stop driving.
[02:03:37.467 --> 02:03:40.269]  So there's some stratas of business that don't like it.
[02:03:40.289 --> 02:03:44.671]  Some big airline CEOs saying don't put the scanners in from Australia to the US.
[02:03:44.971 --> 02:03:48.914]  But the real head honchos, they love the fact that people aren't traveling.
[02:03:52.275 --> 02:03:53.176]  Your take on that, Bob?
[02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:58.783]  Well, I can't figure that out.
[02:03:59.583 --> 02:04:08.429]  You know, we're looking at a situation where if there are people who are running airlines and they don't want people to fly, they're not going to be in business very long.
[02:04:09.189 --> 02:04:19.196]  Now, if they're executives with other companies, well, that might be, you know, the hardy lines to speak by the elitists.
[02:04:20.185 --> 02:04:21.606]  No, that's what I'm saying.
[02:04:21.646 --> 02:04:28.852]  The airlines, all of them are saying they don't like it on record, but Chertoff's got to make his little bit of money, so it's over.
[02:04:30.934 --> 02:04:32.315]  Yeah, well, that's disgusting.
[02:04:34.997 --> 02:04:38.240]  Chertoff, man, he looks like a vampire out of Nosferatu movie.
[02:04:39.621 --> 02:04:40.081]  I mean, literally.
[02:04:40.102 --> 02:04:41.723]  Well, maybe we can cast him.
[02:04:42.622 --> 02:04:46.223]  We ought to put a picture of Nosferatu up next to Chertoff.
[02:04:46.243 --> 02:04:48.524]  You can't... I mean, literally, it's like they're twin brothers or something.
[02:04:48.864 --> 02:04:49.404]  Bob, stay there.
[02:04:49.424 --> 02:04:50.424]  Let's get into the economy.
[02:04:50.804 --> 02:04:53.245]  And after Bob leaves, it's Ron, Jennifer, Fred, Dan, others.
[02:04:53.625 --> 02:04:54.505]  Wide open phones.
[02:04:55.005 --> 02:04:58.987]  And then in the last 20 minutes, I'm gonna have somebody who knew Joe Stack in studio here.
[02:04:59.147 --> 02:05:03.388]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:03.688 --> 02:05:04.268]  Number one.
[02:05:04.588 --> 02:05:08.590]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:08.871 --> 02:05:13.433]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:13.773 --> 02:05:14.234]  It's true.
[02:05:14.514 --> 02:05:19.076]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:20.197 --> 02:05:23.500]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:23.801 --> 02:05:28.265]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:28.505 --> 02:05:30.887]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:31.268 --> 02:05:34.611]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:35.732 --> 02:05:39.654]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:39.874 --> 02:05:44.636]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:44.936 --> 02:05:48.958]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:49.098 --> 02:05:50.659]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:50.899 --> 02:05:55.501]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:06:00.796 --> 02:06:04.437]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.

[02:06:59.170 --> 02:06:59.791]  Hi, everyone.
[02:06:59.951 --> 02:07:00.812]  Andy Anderson here.
[02:07:01.012 --> 02:07:05.277]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[02:07:05.418 --> 02:07:11.084]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[02:07:11.225 --> 02:07:15.470]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, goodbye effectiveness?
[02:07:15.570 --> 02:07:17.272]  No more protection till you use it again.
[02:07:17.412 --> 02:07:18.573]  PureWorks to the rescue!
[02:07:18.753 --> 02:07:23.098]  Our FDA-compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.
[02:07:23.158 --> 02:07:25.200]  Their killing power lasts up to four hours.
[02:07:25.360 --> 02:07:37.251]  PureWorks disinfecting spray is EPA certified to kill swine flu, bird flu, MRSA, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and for our friends in medicine, kills C. diff, along with a whole host of viruses and bacteria.
[02:07:37.371 --> 02:07:38.412]  Moles and fungus too.

[02:07:40.054 --> 02:07:43.137]  You'll love how your skin feels with PureWorks Soft and Supple.
[02:07:43.237 --> 02:07:44.238]  No more dry skin.

[02:07:56.169 --> 02:07:56.469]  That's 888-245-0300.
[02:08:04.289 --> 02:08:04.929]  Big Brother.
[02:08:05.589 --> 02:08:06.630]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:07.370 --> 02:08:08.450]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:09.110 --> 02:08:09.930]  You want answers?
[02:08:10.691 --> 02:08:11.611]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:11.631 --> 02:08:15.912]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:16.452 --> 02:08:20.513]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:20.873 --> 02:08:24.674]  Okay, your calls are coming up in T-minus five minutes.
[02:08:24.834 --> 02:08:28.295]  Bob Chapman of the InternationalForecaster.com is our guest, as he is every Friday.
[02:08:29.235 --> 02:08:29.495]  Bob?
[02:08:30.894 --> 02:08:38.217]  Briefly, you've been saying that you saw 2011-2012 when they would have the designed total implosion.
[02:08:40.197 --> 02:08:42.858]  Are you revising that and now say it may happen this year?
[02:08:43.018 --> 02:08:44.039]  What are the chances of that?
[02:08:44.739 --> 02:08:46.620]  Why are the globalists planning to do this?
[02:08:48.761 --> 02:08:54.983]  I think the globalists are being forced into it, or perhaps being forced into considering it.
[02:08:56.023 --> 02:09:00.645]  And I think a lot depends on what happens over in Europe.
[02:09:01.780 --> 02:09:09.723]  Uh, you know, these nations want a guarantee so that they won't go under, but you can't do that.
[02:09:10.303 --> 02:09:17.546]  I mean, the amounts are colossal, uh, you know, collectively, and that doesn't, you know, just leave the United States out of it.
[02:09:18.426 --> 02:09:25.508]  And so they know that they're going to have to sculpt this thing so that it suits their purposes.
[02:09:26.589 --> 02:09:30.030]  And before we went to break, I said it is possible.
[02:09:30.683 --> 02:09:48.167]  That they may try something simultaneously to bring sovereign debt nations into a meeting because they say there's going to be chaos and they'll make all kinds of exclusive excuses prior to the election.
[02:09:49.407 --> 02:09:51.667]  But I think the chances of that happening are maybe 30%.
[02:09:53.788 --> 02:10:00.329]  I think it's much more likely that starting toward the end of the year that they will be
[02:10:01.434 --> 02:10:30.090]  Making announcements that we got to get together and sort this thing out and we got to have that meeting that I have referred to of all the nations revaluing devaluing Defaulting among nations a new international trading unit such as a g7 weighted and perhaps even partially backed by gold they're going to have to do something and it's going to come sometime in
[02:10:31.221 --> 02:10:34.423]  Between, let's say, October and the end of next year.
[02:10:34.443 --> 02:10:42.328]  And the situation in the United States... Hold on, October this year, and then the end of next year?
[02:10:42.348 --> 02:10:43.389]  You say sometime in there?
[02:10:44.289 --> 02:10:44.550]  Right.
[02:10:44.770 --> 02:11:00.480]  And, you know, in the United States, we're still experiencing, as they are in Ireland and Spain, these tremendous losses in the real estate business, both commercial now, as well as the residential.
[02:11:01.460 --> 02:11:05.161]  And the number of people who are losing homes is phenomenal.
[02:11:06.281 --> 02:11:16.804]  And on top of that, the amount of people getting laid off is less than it's been, but it's still in the minus column.
[02:11:17.925 --> 02:11:22.546]  In other words, unemployment is continuing to grow, but at a lesser rate.
[02:11:23.686 --> 02:11:28.728]  The stimulus, which is in process right now, of which
[02:11:29.522 --> 02:11:31.544]  You know, we hear so many varying stories.
[02:11:32.184 --> 02:11:40.571]  The government says that they've got 35% of the money yet to go, and others in Washington when I talk to say, look, the money's all gone.
[02:11:41.918 --> 02:11:44.000]  All right, Bob, we're almost out of time.
[02:11:44.020 --> 02:11:45.961]  So, bottom line, we're in a real depression.
[02:11:46.722 --> 02:11:53.407]  The media propaganda won't paper over that, and the globalists are damned if they do, damned if they don't, so they may want to intensify the crisis.
[02:11:53.427 --> 02:11:54.368]  We'll continue to follow that.
[02:11:54.688 --> 02:12:03.595]  I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up for just two minutes and then plug International Forecaster for folks that want to get a copy of it, because I didn't dump gold.
[02:12:03.655 --> 02:12:05.216]  I bought it 280 bucks or 300 or 400 or 500 or 600.
[02:12:08.039 --> 02:12:10.127]  And when it went down a few weeks ago, I didn't dump it.
[02:12:10.167 --> 02:12:13.420]  Now it's gone right back up because I know there's concerted global...
[02:12:15.365 --> 02:12:17.547]  Devaluing of currencies together by the G20.
[02:12:17.607 --> 02:12:20.649]  We just put up the headline out of Australia two weeks ago.
[02:12:21.069 --> 02:12:27.253]  Secret banking summit by the 24 top private central banks of the world.
[02:12:28.034 --> 02:12:31.736]  Clearly, they are just absolutely out of control.
[02:12:32.497 --> 02:12:34.738]  And regardless, we know they're devaluing currencies.
[02:12:34.778 --> 02:12:36.079]  Gold is the place to be.
[02:12:36.519 --> 02:12:39.301]  I wanted to bring Ted up briefly, because I know he's busy.
[02:12:40.002 --> 02:12:42.804]  But Ted, you've been offering a deal of francs
[02:12:43.444 --> 02:12:47.248]  That you bought back at the $1,050 level with its $1,100.
[02:12:47.308 --> 02:12:48.669]  What's gold at today, Ted?
[02:12:48.689 --> 02:12:51.232]  Well, right, gold today is $1,126.
[02:12:51.352 --> 02:12:54.616]  Currently right now gold is trading right around $1,120.
[02:13:00.583 --> 02:13:04.025]  So it's gone up quite a bit since that $1,050 range.
[02:13:04.065 --> 02:13:05.807]  Yeah, so it's gone up over $70.
[02:13:05.887 --> 02:13:06.827]  It's gone up over $70.
[02:13:07.187 --> 02:13:18.715]  What's the deal you're offering now, and can you still offer somebody buys one coin that was at the price when it was $70-something less, and they get a free yearly subscription to the International Forecaster?
[02:13:19.616 --> 02:13:20.276]  Yeah, they do.
[02:13:20.757 --> 02:13:21.557]  It's the Frank.
[02:13:21.577 --> 02:13:24.539]  The Frank coin is a one-fifth of an ounce gold coin.
[02:13:25.019 --> 02:13:26.660]  And currently right now they're trading for $249.61.
[02:13:29.673 --> 02:13:38.676]  Now, if you buy one of those coins, Midas is going to pay for the $159 subscription fee to have the International Forecaster for a year for you.
[02:13:39.376 --> 02:13:49.200]  And I don't know how I can make this easier, but that comes out to be about $480 in gold in the price if you take that subscription money out of it.
[02:13:49.640 --> 02:13:55.342]  So, I mean, that turns the clock back about 10 years to buy gold at that price.
[02:13:56.062 --> 02:13:59.143]  That is such a... Alex, it's a great deal.
[02:13:59.753 --> 02:14:04.314]  It's all about educating the people and getting people interested in gold, obviously.
[02:14:04.514 --> 02:14:06.534]  And you're saying you can still offer that?
[02:14:06.554 --> 02:14:09.235]  Because you were talking three days ago that you were about to get rid of it.
[02:14:09.275 --> 02:14:10.535]  You're still offering that deal?
[02:14:11.355 --> 02:14:14.356]  I can still offer that deal because I still have supply.
[02:14:14.376 --> 02:14:16.136]  I was able to buy enough.
[02:14:16.516 --> 02:14:24.098]  And in addition to that, you know, gold prices have gone up and then it backed off a little bit, which kind of scares people away from the marketplace.
[02:14:24.158 --> 02:14:25.838]  I wish people were smarter than that, Alex.
[02:14:26.298 --> 02:14:28.659]  Because they really need to be getting into the gold right now.
[02:14:29.754 --> 02:14:31.336]  Bob is talking about October.
[02:14:31.676 --> 02:14:37.763]  You and I both know there's going to be a lot of motivating factors this fall that are just going to drive people to go like crazy.
[02:14:40.401 --> 02:14:41.181]  A time machine.
[02:14:41.241 --> 02:14:46.903]  Once you get into the fall, gold and silver just rages forward, you know, and there's so many economic problems then.
[02:14:46.923 --> 02:14:50.264]  Well, bottom line, the bankers have been trying to drive down gold.
[02:14:50.284 --> 02:14:51.425]  They've been unsuccessful.
[02:14:51.805 --> 02:14:53.085]  You bought gold when it was $1,050.
[02:14:53.245 --> 02:14:56.026]  It's $1,120-something today.
[02:14:56.526 --> 02:14:58.747]  You're offering it to them at the lower price.
[02:14:59.247 --> 02:15:05.829]  You buy it when it's low, sell it when it's high, at the old low price, and give people the free newsletter that's invaluable.
[02:15:06.129 --> 02:15:07.289]  This is a thick newsletter.
[02:15:07.329 --> 02:15:08.830]  Tell us about your newsletter, Bob Chapman.
[02:15:10.615 --> 02:15:14.059]  ...finance, economic, social, and political issues all over the world.
[02:15:14.879 --> 02:15:18.463]  By email, we produce a publication every Wednesday and Saturday.
[02:15:18.863 --> 02:15:20.665]  Runs around 40 pages each time.
[02:15:21.266 --> 02:15:25.991]  And for the people who are not on the internet, we have a hard copy as well that goes out twice a month.
[02:15:26.571 --> 02:15:31.196]  So, I can't see how anybody can turn down Ted's offer.
[02:15:33.032 --> 02:15:33.673]  Absolutely.
[02:15:33.693 --> 02:15:34.754]  800-686-2237.
[02:15:36.677 --> 02:15:41.163]  The gold prices on his website are a lot higher and they're still great deals.
[02:15:41.203 --> 02:15:42.324]  This is for my audience.
[02:15:42.905 --> 02:15:44.527]  Ted, can you run this through Sunday?
[02:15:45.328 --> 02:15:47.411]  Yeah, we're gonna run it right straight through Sunday.
[02:15:48.140 --> 02:15:52.986]  And you gotta remember that Federal Reserve raising the interest rates was to shore up the value of the U.S.
[02:15:53.046 --> 02:15:54.668]  dollar and gold's going up anyways.
[02:15:54.728 --> 02:15:57.651]  That should be a tell-tale sign for people to be getting into gold.
[02:16:08.564 --> 02:16:12.547]  On the weekend, if they don't answer, leave your name and number, you'll still be able to get the deal on Monday.
[02:16:12.647 --> 02:16:15.068]  If you got your call in by Sunday evening, 800-686-2237.
[02:16:15.088 --> 02:16:25.255]  800-686-2237 and get that free copy of the International Forecaster and get the gold at a cheaper price.
[02:16:25.635 --> 02:16:27.696]  Or go to the internationalforecaster.com and pay for it.
[02:16:28.137 --> 02:16:30.118]  Bob Chapman, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:16:30.158 --> 02:16:30.998]  We'll see you next Friday.
[02:16:31.839 --> 02:16:33.560]  Surely, and thank you all for listening.
[02:16:34.701 --> 02:16:37.943]  Ted Anderson, again, one more time, explain to people the deal they're getting here.
[02:16:39.133 --> 02:16:40.514]  Yeah, it's a Frank coin.
[02:16:40.554 --> 02:16:43.175]  It's the coin that was used in Europe for trading.
[02:16:43.415 --> 02:16:47.837]  It was, it's out of Belgium, it's out of, you know, Switzerland had them, the French had them.
[02:16:48.217 --> 02:16:50.138]  It's a one fifth of an ounce gold coin.
[02:16:50.198 --> 02:16:51.719]  Right now it's at 249.
[02:16:52.159 --> 02:16:54.300]  Bob Chapman's newsletters, 159.
[02:16:54.660 --> 02:17:02.143]  So if you take 249 and you multiply it by five and you subtract the 159 from that, you're going to find about $480 gold.
[02:17:02.804 --> 02:17:08.006]  I don't know how I can make it easier for you to buy gold and also give yourself an education at the same time.
[02:17:08.516 --> 02:17:11.237]  Hopefully be able to make some smart decisions about your money.
[02:17:11.797 --> 02:17:15.739]  Because I can tell you right now, there's way too many cracks in the plaster.
[02:17:16.099 --> 02:17:18.360]  The United States is way too far into debt.
[02:17:18.761 --> 02:17:21.702]  The European countries right now, obviously, are falling apart.
[02:17:22.222 --> 02:17:25.483]  And for some reason, they think they can bail each other out.
[02:17:25.584 --> 02:17:27.404]  I mean, the United States can't bail out Europe.
[02:17:27.424 --> 02:17:28.905]  We can't even bail ourselves out.
[02:17:29.245 --> 02:17:32.347]  And they're devaluing currency simultaneously.
[02:17:32.367 --> 02:17:32.407]  800-686-237.
[02:17:32.507 --> 02:17:33.467]  Ted, thanks for joining us.
[02:17:33.507 --> 02:17:35.268]  Yeah, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[02:17:38.846 --> 02:17:39.607]  Okay, here's the deal.
[02:17:39.747 --> 02:17:41.288]  I'm going to now move to your calls quickly.
[02:17:41.348 --> 02:17:43.870]  Please throw out your question, your comment, and move to the next person.
[02:17:43.990 --> 02:17:46.292]  In the last 15-20 minutes, I'm going to have Rob Dew in here.
[02:17:46.653 --> 02:18:00.184]  He knew and was off and on with different bands with Joe Stack, who it turned out supposedly played with Joe Ely and all these other big Austin... I mean, Rob Dew says he was an incredible musician, very quiet, didn't talk about politics.
[02:18:00.524 --> 02:18:01.605]  We'll talk to him in studio.
[02:18:01.865 --> 02:18:03.887]  Let's go to Ron in Texas.
[02:18:03.967 --> 02:18:04.808]  Ron, thanks for holding.
[02:18:05.689 --> 02:18:06.409]  No problem, Alex.
[02:18:06.469 --> 02:18:07.850]  I appreciate you letting me take the call.
[02:18:08.851 --> 02:18:25.518]  I just want to be real quick and say that today on Fox News, they had another interview with another band member that Mr. Stacks played with, and he basically said the same thing that Mr. Dew said yesterday, that this guy was a real intelligent, was very squared away individual, you know.
[02:18:26.198 --> 02:18:29.360]  He was basically baffled at what happened.
[02:18:29.904 --> 02:18:33.065]  I don't want to call it a manifesto because it doesn't sound like one to me.
[02:18:33.085 --> 02:18:35.126]  It sounds more like a personal vent of his frustrations.
[02:18:51.534 --> 02:18:52.674]  It shows his intelligence.
[02:18:52.694 --> 02:18:55.875]  He's just frustrated or was frustrated.
[02:18:56.615 --> 02:19:03.237]  And I think what we're seeing is a change in tactic as far as, you know, like some people label psyops.
[02:19:04.357 --> 02:19:07.338]  It's where an individual actually does something on their own.
[02:19:08.138 --> 02:19:17.900]  But yet the higher echelons of, you know, lack of a better term, the enemy will let it play out and let people react to it in the way they want to see it.
[02:19:20.342 --> 02:19:21.403]  Very well said.
[02:19:21.423 --> 02:19:28.527]  That's probably what's going on here, though there's a lot of other very suspicious signs, so the jury is going to be out for a while as we study it.
[02:19:29.267 --> 02:19:31.848]  Early on it was clear the underwear bomber was inside job.
[02:19:31.888 --> 02:19:32.169]  Now it's 100%.
[02:19:33.189 --> 02:19:38.732]  By the way, we have video that's never been seen of Joe Stack that Rob Dew went home and dug out last night.
[02:19:39.133 --> 02:19:41.494]  Now we've cropped the video to leave the other band members out.
[02:19:41.514 --> 02:19:42.534]  We're not going to even play the music.
[02:19:42.835 --> 02:19:44.596]  We're going to show you some video of Joe Stack here.
[02:19:45.456 --> 02:19:49.618]  Nobody's ever seen, coming up at PrisonPlanet.tv, if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv viewer.
[02:19:49.638 --> 02:19:53.460]  Of course, it'll then be all over the web after that, but that's coming up.
[02:19:53.480 --> 02:19:56.201]  We're going to talk to Jennifer, Fred, Dan, and others straight ahead.
[02:19:56.501 --> 02:19:57.362]  Great call, Ron.
[02:19:59.062 --> 02:20:02.243]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:20:02.623 --> 02:20:04.443]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:20:04.903 --> 02:20:05.323]  Don't!
[02:20:05.763 --> 02:20:08.804]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:20:09.204 --> 02:20:17.966]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb Kay's number one debt secret.
[02:20:18.286 --> 02:20:21.967]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[02:20:22.367 --> 02:20:25.089]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[02:20:25.509 --> 02:20:32.533]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[02:20:32.873 --> 02:20:33.874]  Herb K was right.
[02:20:34.074 --> 02:20:37.156]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:20:37.256 --> 02:20:38.277]  What have you got to lose?
[02:20:38.597 --> 02:20:41.739]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.

[02:20:46.802 --> 02:20:46.842]  888-352-7726.
[02:20:46.862 --> 02:20:50.084]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:20:50.704 --> 02:20:52.845]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:20:52.865 --> 02:20:55.127]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:21:09.733 --> 02:21:12.394]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:21:12.414 --> 02:21:18.637]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:21:18.798 --> 02:21:23.840]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:21:24.340 --> 02:21:33.965]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:21:34.085 --> 02:21:36.207]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:21:36.447 --> 02:21:37.768]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:38.028 --> 02:21:40.310]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:40.490 --> 02:21:42.331]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:21:42.611 --> 02:21:47.415]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:23:57.712 --> 02:24:06.677]  I say I shot the sheriff, but I swear it wasn't self-defense.
[02:24:07.657 --> 02:24:08.918]  Oh, Sheriff John Brown!
[02:24:22.686 --> 02:24:28.331]  Let's go to your calls, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:29.912 --> 02:24:32.294]  Let's talk to Jennifer in Texas.
[02:24:32.394 --> 02:24:33.395]  You're on the air.
[02:24:45.285 --> 02:24:45.845]  Hello Alex.
[02:24:46.165 --> 02:24:46.705]  Welcome.
[02:24:46.725 --> 02:24:47.745]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:24:48.246 --> 02:24:49.246]  Thanks for calling.
[02:24:49.666 --> 02:24:51.606]  I just wanted to make some quick comments.
[02:24:51.646 --> 02:24:52.846]  I'll try to make it quick.
[02:24:53.307 --> 02:25:02.008]  Beck has made himself irrelevant and the 500,000 views that he has lost, probably half of those are Texans because we're angry about him attacking Deborah Medina.
[02:25:03.288 --> 02:25:07.249]  Beck, I'm on the fence like you are with this man yesterday that flew this plane into this building.
[02:25:07.889 --> 02:25:11.490]  Although I don't condone what he did, I can sympathize with him.
[02:25:12.063 --> 02:25:19.146]  Uh, you know, if I had more time, if I even had an hour, I could tell you some very harrowing stories of what me and my husband have been through for the last 11 years.
[02:25:19.666 --> 02:25:25.249]  And if someone wants what you have, uh, and they don't want to take it legally, they'll do it illegally in any way
[02:25:27.433 --> 02:25:42.842]  Hey, with my dad, with the 89 retroactive tax increase, he paid all the taxes out of CPA, and they came to him and said, we want $500,000, and that was a lot more money than he had, and sold our cars, everything.
[02:25:42.862 --> 02:25:52.107]  And my dad went in with all of his receipts and everything, and they said, look, Mr. Jones, and this happened in Mesquite, Texas, they said, we are white-collar criminals.
[02:25:52.367 --> 02:25:53.248]  Give us the money.
[02:25:54.068 --> 02:25:55.468]  And they are criminals.
[02:25:55.688 --> 02:25:57.869]  And it's an illegal tax of the Federal Reserve.
[02:25:57.909 --> 02:25:59.409]  Believe me, I know about the IRS.
[02:25:59.909 --> 02:26:00.649]  It's disgusting.
[02:26:01.209 --> 02:26:03.290]  We stayed up on our taxes.
[02:26:03.690 --> 02:26:06.210]  Our problem is, we've got land... My dad did too!
[02:26:06.290 --> 02:26:09.871]  They did a retroactive tax increase and then put penalties on it.
[02:26:10.471 --> 02:26:11.951]  Oh yeah, that's been happening to us.
[02:26:12.111 --> 02:26:16.792]  And I just want to tell your listeners, though, that tyranny does not happen just at the federal and state levels.
[02:26:16.852 --> 02:26:18.112]  It happens at the local level.
[02:26:18.452 --> 02:26:20.933]  And that's what's been happening to me and my husband for the last 11 years.
[02:26:21.897 --> 02:26:29.720]  And these people in this town want this little jewel of a piece of land that we have, but they don't want to buy it outright because we're not going to sell it in the first place.
[02:26:30.160 --> 02:26:33.901]  They want to take it illegally and they have done everything in their power to take it away from us.
[02:26:34.381 --> 02:26:35.741]  And we are still going through this.
[02:26:36.122 --> 02:26:49.666]  We still have stuff coming up on our TV, for God's sakes, we don't know where it's coming from, that even a best friend of ours that lives in the Dallas-Fort Worth area that has sold these TVs for years, he's an expert on these, can't tell us what this stuff is coming up on our TV.
[02:26:50.219 --> 02:26:54.460]  Now I'm not saying our television is bugged, but I'm saying our television is picking up something.
[02:26:54.520 --> 02:26:55.601]  Are you kidding?
[02:26:55.821 --> 02:27:03.043]  It came out public schools are using the quote free laptops they give kids to use the spy cams to spy on them and read everything they're writing.
[02:27:03.123 --> 02:27:04.583]  No, everything's a surveillance grid.
[02:27:04.623 --> 02:27:05.663]  I appreciate your call, Jennifer.
[02:27:05.984 --> 02:27:07.304]  Fred Mayne, you're on the air.
[02:27:07.344 --> 02:27:07.784]  Go ahead.
[02:27:08.864 --> 02:27:10.605]  Yeah, I'll expect some of that taking my call.
[02:27:10.725 --> 02:27:17.667]  I just wanted you and all your listeners to be aware of the fact that there's a historic press conference happening right now in San Francisco
[02:27:18.636 --> 02:27:31.785]  I'm one of 1,041 architects and engineers and 6,600 other people who've signed Richard Gage's petition demanding of Congress a truly independent investigation with full subpoena powers.
[02:27:32.843 --> 02:27:34.664]  On the 9-11 day.
[02:27:35.144 --> 02:27:36.084]  Well, that's wonderful.
[02:27:36.424 --> 02:27:38.164]  I mean, that's wonderful, Fred.
[02:27:38.204 --> 02:27:39.105]  And we've plugged it.
[02:27:39.125 --> 02:27:39.645]  We've supported it.
[02:27:39.665 --> 02:27:41.265]  We've had Richard Gage on many times.
[02:27:41.685 --> 02:27:44.766]  And yes, 9-11 truth is only growing stronger and stronger.
[02:27:44.806 --> 02:27:45.526]  Good to hear from you.
[02:27:45.766 --> 02:27:47.887]  Let's talk to Dan in Pennsylvania.
[02:27:47.927 --> 02:27:48.727]  Dan, you're on the air.
[02:27:48.747 --> 02:27:50.027]  Hi, Alex.
[02:27:50.307 --> 02:27:53.188]  Yeah, this is... What is it?
[02:27:53.328 --> 02:27:58.029]  Last night, I listened to Katie Couric on the CBS Evening News.
[02:27:58.689 --> 02:28:01.450]  And she had mentioned that, like in passing, that
[02:28:02.293 --> 02:28:22.423]  The mother and the daughter, they had been in a hotel room when all of this had happened, when yesterday while I was watching your show on the commercials, I was watching MSNBC, and the gentleman in the brown jacket had said that a neighbor went into the house and got the mother and the daughter out.
[02:28:23.044 --> 02:28:31.068]  And also, one other question just for Bob, what does it mean with the Goldman Sachs guy that is taking over in Greece?
[02:28:32.776 --> 02:28:36.639]  Well, Bob's gone now, but it's come out in mainstream news what Bob said a decade ago.
[02:28:36.959 --> 02:28:39.401]  Goldman Sachs set up double books all over Europe.
[02:28:39.662 --> 02:28:40.843]  They ran the scam here.
[02:28:41.343 --> 02:28:42.904]  It's not that they own the whole scam.
[02:28:42.944 --> 02:28:44.165]  It's other big banks involved.
[02:28:44.506 --> 02:28:45.767]  They're the little criminal group.
[02:28:45.807 --> 02:28:53.613]  They chose to coordinate it, kind of like Enron and all these other crooks had Arthur Anderson cook their books.
[02:28:54.053 --> 02:28:55.815]  It's like they were the go-to for that.
[02:28:57.153 --> 02:29:02.534]  The piloting group of the criminal gang is mainly Goldman Sachs, and so that's what's happening there.
[02:29:03.120 --> 02:29:09.863]  Yeah, I just thought I'd mention also the fact of that, of the mother and the daughter, because there seems to be conflicting stories happening there.
[02:29:10.163 --> 02:29:12.984]  The whole thing is incredibly suspicious.
[02:29:13.104 --> 02:29:23.508]  And what's happening is, because a lot of people somewhat agree with what he did, because people are ready to fight, I think that's clouding some people's judgment and saying, no, it's not a false flag.
[02:29:24.008 --> 02:29:24.769]  We don't know that.
[02:29:26.169 --> 02:29:27.370]  We're still collating data.
[02:29:27.410 --> 02:29:30.431]  There's a lot of signs that say false flag, a lot of signs that say it isn't.
[02:29:31.598 --> 02:29:36.482]  You know, it could be a false flag, but it didn't go the way the media wanted, so they may be backing off of it now.
[02:29:36.522 --> 02:29:41.286]  But the fact that they are backing off of it, that could also mean that it is a real event.
[02:29:41.306 --> 02:29:42.848]  Because if it's a real event, they don't hype it.
[02:29:43.428 --> 02:29:44.509]  That's always a key sign.
[02:29:44.910 --> 02:29:47.932]  More calls, straight ahead, than Rob Dew in studio.
[02:29:49.734 --> 02:29:50.635]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.135 --> 02:29:52.736]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.657 --> 02:29:56.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.399 --> 02:30:04.022]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:30:04.042 --> 02:30:07.425]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:30:07.645 --> 02:30:12.429]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:30:12.449 --> 02:30:18.714]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:30:18.854 --> 02:30:21.076]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:30:21.596 --> 02:30:21.896]  Tim Geithner?
[02:30:21.916 --> 02:30:22.337]  Bernanke?
[02:30:22.437 --> 02:30:23.197]  They're arsonists!
[02:30:23.237 --> 02:30:24.358]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:30:24.378 --> 02:30:26.620]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:30:40.512 --> 02:30:42.913]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:30:42.933 --> 02:30:45.454]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:30:45.474 --> 02:30:47.094]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:31:10.143 --> 02:31:12.804]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:31:12.824 --> 02:31:19.065]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:31:19.205 --> 02:31:24.246]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:31:24.406 --> 02:31:34.388]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:31:34.508 --> 02:31:36.630]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:31:36.850 --> 02:31:38.171]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:31:38.451 --> 02:31:40.713]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:31:40.914 --> 02:31:42.735]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:31:43.035 --> 02:31:47.860]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:31:48.180 --> 02:31:52.964]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[02:31:53.204 --> 02:31:57.308]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:31:59.975 --> 02:32:00.536]  Hi, neighbor.
[02:32:00.556 --> 02:32:06.341]  No matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[02:32:06.981 --> 02:32:12.766]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas, birthdays, and vacations in order to store all the food possible.
[02:32:13.487 --> 02:32:16.729]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[02:32:17.390 --> 02:32:20.613]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[02:32:21.278 --> 02:32:24.640]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy and foolish.
[02:32:25.241 --> 02:32:29.743]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[02:32:30.484 --> 02:32:32.445]  We will still have two regrets.
[02:32:33.106 --> 02:32:36.448]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[02:32:37.128 --> 02:32:40.030]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[02:32:40.790 --> 02:32:46.194]  Putting off emergency food preparations will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.
[02:32:47.006 --> 02:32:47.246]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:32:47.346 --> 02:32:48.387]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[02:32:48.407 --> 02:32:48.447]  800-409-5633.
[02:32:48.547 --> 02:32:49.868]  I'm the voice inside your head.
[02:32:49.888 --> 02:32:51.409]  You refuse to leave.
[02:32:51.589 --> 02:32:54.271]  And I'm the face that you have to face.
[02:32:54.291 --> 02:32:55.012]  Mirror in your stare.
[02:33:17.156 --> 02:33:17.776]  Yeah!
[02:33:17.816 --> 02:33:19.296]  We are live!
[02:33:40.734 --> 02:33:42.596]  Rob Dues in here with us in the studio right now.
[02:33:42.616 --> 02:33:44.257]  I'm going to go back to some more of your phone calls.
[02:33:44.317 --> 02:33:49.502]  And we've got this world exclusive video of him playing in multiple local bands.
[02:33:50.943 --> 02:33:52.204]  Rob shot this a few years ago.
[02:33:52.244 --> 02:33:56.628]  Rob knew Joe Stack and didn't hit him until yesterday when they just left his house.
[02:33:57.228 --> 02:34:01.749]  And he got back and saw, finally, his photo, and he said, because you said you were driving back, saying, I know Joe Stack.
[02:34:02.049 --> 02:34:02.869]  I know of Joe Stack.
[02:34:02.889 --> 02:34:04.009]  Was it another state I lived?
[02:34:04.310 --> 02:34:05.130]  And then it all hits you.
[02:34:05.150 --> 02:34:09.651]  Because Austin's a big-sized city, but the musician community's like a small town.
[02:34:09.931 --> 02:34:10.811]  Everybody knows each other.
[02:34:11.091 --> 02:34:11.711]  He knew him well.
[02:34:12.291 --> 02:34:15.932]  They weren't in the same band, but Joe did back up in some bands.
[02:34:16.472 --> 02:34:19.573]  And it turns out he played for Joe Ely and a bunch of other people I'm seeing in the news now.
[02:34:20.733 --> 02:34:24.196]  So, meanwhile, I have a whole bunch of mainstream news articles.
[02:34:24.836 --> 02:34:27.298]  The statesman saying I'm praising him.
[02:34:27.878 --> 02:34:28.559]  Not true.
[02:34:29.119 --> 02:34:30.300]  Daily News saying it.
[02:34:31.761 --> 02:34:32.521]  Look at this headline.
[02:34:32.781 --> 02:34:37.364]  Does Austin plane crash pilot's rambling suicide note sound like Alex Jones manifesto?
[02:34:37.905 --> 02:34:39.306]  So you can always see who the enemy is.
[02:34:39.726 --> 02:34:41.247]  Some guy kills a cop in Pennsylvania.
[02:34:41.287 --> 02:34:42.288]  They say he did it for me.
[02:34:42.648 --> 02:34:43.869]  Then they get his actual emails.
[02:34:43.929 --> 02:34:44.689]  I hate Alex Jones.
[02:34:44.729 --> 02:34:45.250]  I want to get him.
[02:34:45.910 --> 02:34:47.631]  I mean, they're after me and I wonder why.
[02:34:47.992 --> 02:34:48.872]  But it's not going to work.
[02:34:48.952 --> 02:34:49.593]  It's like the old
[02:34:51.033 --> 02:34:51.554]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:34:51.574 --> 02:34:52.054]  It's an honor.
[02:34:52.074 --> 02:34:53.374]  I just wanted to plug a movie real quick.
[02:34:53.394 --> 02:34:55.075]  It's a mainstream movie out right now.
[02:34:55.095 --> 02:34:57.376]  It's Edge of Darkness, Mel Gibson's new movie.
[02:35:12.409 --> 02:35:13.150]  It's very good.
[02:35:13.170 --> 02:35:19.314]  It's the first movie I've seen since that movie Truth or Movie Shooter came out in 2007 with Mark Wahlberg.
[02:35:19.654 --> 02:35:20.254]  What's it about?
[02:35:20.274 --> 02:35:21.575]  Does it have a patriot message?
[02:35:22.676 --> 02:35:24.017]  Yes.
[02:35:24.337 --> 02:35:26.159]  It's basically a cautionary tale.
[02:35:26.699 --> 02:35:30.682]  Mel Gibson plays the role of a Boston, just a regular detective.
[02:35:31.402 --> 02:35:33.283]  And his daughter,
[02:35:34.696 --> 02:35:37.697]  Basically gets assassinated and he mistakes it.
[02:35:37.817 --> 02:35:42.099]  Everyone thinks that it was some old enemy of his that was trying to take him out.
[02:35:42.619 --> 02:35:48.842]  He starts investigating and during the course of investigating, going through her things and whatnot, he finds out that she was an activist.
[02:35:50.342 --> 02:35:51.403]  And it gets really interesting.
[02:35:51.443 --> 02:35:57.431]  It's got some Truth or Elements in there, Black Op Elements, all that kind of shadowy government stuff.
[02:35:57.471 --> 02:36:00.975]  Yeah, well we know Mel Gibson knows all about the New World Order and I'll just leave it at that.
[02:36:01.936 --> 02:36:05.901]  But, I mean, he's definitely on board and knows what's going on on every front.
[02:36:06.201 --> 02:36:07.162]  I appreciate your call.
[02:36:07.222 --> 02:36:08.163]  I'm going to go see that.
[02:36:08.183 --> 02:36:09.125]  I just work all the time.
[02:36:09.571 --> 02:36:10.932]  I got two, three hours a day off.
[02:36:10.973 --> 02:36:17.960]  I go play with my kids, throw the football, watch them ride their scooters, their little push scooters, and that's it.
[02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:22.004]  I take my grandma out to eat once every two weeks and there is no life, literally.
[02:36:22.725 --> 02:36:25.488]  But all work and no play hadn't made Jack a dull boy.
[02:36:25.528 --> 02:36:26.309]  It's made me crazy.
[02:36:28.274 --> 02:36:30.076]  Let's talk to Dennis in Texas.
[02:36:30.116 --> 02:36:31.016]  Dennis, you're on the air.
[02:36:31.056 --> 02:36:31.517]  Go ahead.
[02:36:32.137 --> 02:36:34.639]  Alex, thank you for having me on the show.
[02:36:35.780 --> 02:36:40.764]  I voted for Debra Medina today, so I feel like I've struck a blow for liberty.
[02:36:40.864 --> 02:36:43.386]  That's right, early voting running for the next two weeks.
[02:36:43.847 --> 02:36:45.628]  Yes, people ought to get out and do that.
[02:36:45.848 --> 02:36:46.889]  It's well worth it.
[02:36:47.670 --> 02:36:50.432]  You avoid all the lines.
[02:36:50.592 --> 02:36:51.653]  Alex, you're a patriot.
[02:36:51.753 --> 02:36:53.775]  Mr. Trafficant is a statesman.
[02:36:54.255 --> 02:36:56.157]  Bob Chapman is America's muse.
[02:36:57.186 --> 02:37:01.410]  I'd also like to say that Red Beckman woke me up.
[02:37:01.470 --> 02:37:14.340]  I heard him on your program, oh, I think a couple weeks ago now, and ordered the books, and everybody's wondering what they can do short of revolution and short of utilizing the Second Amendment.
[02:37:17.352 --> 02:37:23.073]  They're afraid we're going to take over?
[02:37:23.093 --> 02:37:24.334]  Yeah, that we're the boss.
[02:37:24.614 --> 02:37:26.594]  That we're going to take over the state houses legally?
[02:37:26.914 --> 02:37:28.615]  Take over the juries, grand juries?
[02:37:29.295 --> 02:37:31.515]  That's all this show is about is solutions.
[02:37:31.795 --> 02:37:34.976]  That's why the COINTELPRO have this line that I don't give solutions.
[02:37:35.316 --> 02:37:37.377]  All we give is solutions.
[02:37:37.697 --> 02:37:40.638]  All we bring you is guests that are about solutions.
[02:37:40.738 --> 02:37:41.878]  And give them a bigger platform.
[02:37:46.983 --> 02:37:58.049]  The citizenry, using their three votes, vote at the ballot box, vote as part of the grand jury, and vote as part of the jury petit.
[02:37:58.910 --> 02:38:03.972]  And the IRS cannot overturn a not guilty vote.
[02:38:04.413 --> 02:38:10.076]  We can defeat the income tax and all taxes and all laws that are unjust.
[02:38:11.192 --> 02:38:13.553]  By simply being Americans.
[02:38:13.853 --> 02:38:15.254]  And that's the Founding Fathers.
[02:38:16.075 --> 02:38:18.016]  Are we with the Founding Fathers of the New World Order?
[02:38:18.056 --> 02:38:18.856]  Let's take a few more.
[02:38:18.896 --> 02:38:19.336]  Thank you.
[02:38:19.656 --> 02:38:21.097]  Let's talk to James in Minnesota.
[02:38:21.117 --> 02:38:21.978]  James, you're on the air.
[02:38:24.299 --> 02:38:24.559]  Hello?
[02:38:24.999 --> 02:38:25.479]  Yes, sir.
[02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:28.381]  Hi, my name is James Cater from Minnesota.
[02:38:30.142 --> 02:38:32.723]  I just want to say thanks for letting me be on your show real quick.
[02:38:32.783 --> 02:38:35.865]  And second, just to talk to you briefly,
[02:38:36.929 --> 02:38:38.671]  I'm a former military vet myself.
[02:38:39.331 --> 02:38:50.202]  I just got out less than a year ago and I feel bad for a lot of these guys that come back all torn up and the government don't, you know, stick by us or nothing like that.
[02:38:50.783 --> 02:38:53.546]  So I just want to say thank you for opening up my eyes.
[02:38:53.686 --> 02:38:57.650]  I mean, I already knew that they were crooked as a three-legged door anyway.
[02:38:59.574 --> 02:39:07.250]  I want to say thank you for opening up my eyes to more and plus see if there's any way that I can, what I can do here in Minnesota to spread the word.
[02:39:07.848 --> 02:39:09.950]  Every person, well the best thing is my films.
[02:39:09.970 --> 02:39:11.591]  Get the DVDs, make copies.
[02:39:11.631 --> 02:39:12.992]  We found that is the most effective.
[02:39:13.012 --> 02:39:18.877]  Fall of the Republic, Obama Deception, the free MP3s of this show, sending people to InfoWars.com.
[02:39:18.897 --> 02:39:23.301]  I mean they're going to hear a wide spectrum breakdown of the New World Order and solutions here.
[02:39:23.321 --> 02:39:25.603]  I mean let me ask you, how did you wake up?
[02:39:25.643 --> 02:39:28.165]  You say I woke you up fully, you already knew something was wrong.
[02:39:28.425 --> 02:39:29.466]  How did you find the show?
[02:39:30.287 --> 02:39:31.347]  This is actually really funny.
[02:39:32.600 --> 02:39:47.125]  About three months after I got out, I was working at Target in Rochester and a friend of mine came up to me and she's like, you know, one of my buddies came up and said, oh, don't talk to her, she's a conspiracy theorist and this and that.
[02:39:47.145 --> 02:39:48.085]  And I'm like, well, you know what?
[02:39:48.365 --> 02:39:49.346]  She's right up my alley.
[02:39:50.326 --> 02:39:54.768]  So I went over there and I talked to her a little bit and she handed me your DVDs.
[02:39:55.768 --> 02:39:56.728]  And I was like, wow.
[02:39:56.748 --> 02:40:01.270]  And then I got a couple of my buddies, you know, they watched it and I just watched their mouths just drop.
[02:40:02.901 --> 02:40:08.643]  Well, when I say that Obama deception and fall of the Republican endgame are devastating truth weapons.
[02:40:08.683 --> 02:40:09.763]  I mean, the truth is powerful.
[02:40:09.803 --> 02:40:10.543]  It trumps everything.
[02:40:10.843 --> 02:40:13.464]  And these films give you a full-spectrum breakdown.
[02:40:13.764 --> 02:40:14.385]  It's the truth.
[02:40:14.445 --> 02:40:16.945]  It's in the globalist's own words, their own documents.
[02:40:17.165 --> 02:40:19.126]  See, I said, you said, how do I help?
[02:40:19.646 --> 02:40:20.846]  Well, she woke you up.
[02:40:20.946 --> 02:40:22.047]  You then woke your buddies up.
[02:40:22.347 --> 02:40:24.287]  It's not going to be an instant war we win.
[02:40:24.627 --> 02:40:26.468]  It's slow, one foot in front of the other.
[02:40:26.508 --> 02:40:27.468]  I'm getting chills right now.
[02:40:28.028 --> 02:40:29.169]  Never stopping.
[02:40:31.924 --> 02:40:32.964]  I just got big chills.
[02:40:33.305 --> 02:40:37.386]  Having the will to have the enemy crush you.
[02:40:37.646 --> 02:40:38.326]  Because here's the deal.
[02:40:38.426 --> 02:40:41.267]  I'm a big fish and they've tried to crush me and it hasn't worked, but they probably will.
[02:40:41.888 --> 02:40:44.849]  But I just am happy for this to happen because it doesn't matter.
[02:40:45.109 --> 02:40:46.249]  I've already done my damage to them.
[02:40:46.529 --> 02:40:51.451]  You have to be fully committed and not care and be confident and focused and have the truth and it's over.
[02:40:51.511 --> 02:40:52.111]  God bless you.
[02:40:52.371 --> 02:40:53.952]  Good to hear from you, James, in Minnesota.
[02:40:55.134 --> 02:41:16.106]  Bob, Dave, Jerry, Moses, I want to get to you, but I've got, and we probably will, but I've got to go to Rob Due right now because I did a special transmission from 530 to 630, or 530 to 640 last night that's just on the internet streams and PrisonPlanet.tv, and that's all posted up at PrisonPlanet.tv, because as I was about to go live,
[02:41:16.926 --> 02:41:19.387]  He, or as I was live, he ran in and said, I knew this guy.
[02:41:19.407 --> 02:41:21.688]  You hadn't put two and two together because you work with so many musicians.
[02:41:22.269 --> 02:41:24.870]  So just in a nutshell, what type of guy was he?
[02:41:25.550 --> 02:41:26.951]  Do you think he was capable of this?
[02:41:27.011 --> 02:41:28.572]  What do you think's going on here?
[02:41:31.073 --> 02:41:33.134]  And then we're going to show some video.
[02:41:34.455 --> 02:41:37.896]  And we'll talk over, because it doesn't have audio, because we're not going to play the band's music here.
[02:41:40.919 --> 02:41:45.862]  But break this down, how you met this guy and what your gut tells you is going on.
[02:41:46.343 --> 02:41:48.284]  Alright.
[02:41:48.304 --> 02:41:50.165]  I had a neighbor who was a musician.
[02:41:50.205 --> 02:41:51.766]  He was a little older than me.
[02:41:51.786 --> 02:41:54.408]  He was playing like an older style kind of blues, country rock.
[02:41:55.189 --> 02:41:59.952]  And so I would go in and sit in playing bass because he always needed a bass player.
[02:42:00.072 --> 02:42:01.593]  And Joe Stack was in his band.
[02:42:02.393 --> 02:42:04.034]  And in different versions of the band.
[02:42:04.475 --> 02:42:05.415]  I gotta stop you.
[02:42:05.495 --> 02:42:06.896]  I guess we didn't test the video.
[02:42:07.137 --> 02:42:08.037]  It's crashing in there.
[02:42:08.077 --> 02:42:08.738]  It's not playing.
[02:42:11.640 --> 02:42:14.362]  What other formats do you have of it so we can, I guess we didn't test it.
[02:42:14.522 --> 02:42:19.845]  Oh, well I brought it in on a DVD and I just... So the DVD doesn't play?
[02:42:23.048 --> 02:42:24.189]  Just turn the mic on so I can hear you.
[02:42:28.432 --> 02:42:32.535]  No, I know, but if the DVD isn't working, we'll just... If they pull it on the hard drive, it should work.
[02:42:33.215 --> 02:42:38.939]  Sometimes DVDs, when it's not a DVD file, it's an actual QuickTime file, so if you pull that on the hard drive, it should work.
[02:42:42.298 --> 02:42:44.920]  Tell you what, I'm going to go out there and deal with this.
[02:42:45.100 --> 02:42:46.641]  You go ahead and tell folks about Joe Stack.
[02:42:46.821 --> 02:42:48.042]  Okay.
[02:42:48.443 --> 02:42:50.704]  I met Joe a few years ago.
[02:42:50.724 --> 02:42:52.306]  This was in the mid-2000s.
[02:42:52.486 --> 02:42:58.230]  I was playing bass with a neighbor, and Joe was in the band.
[02:42:58.270 --> 02:43:05.515]  I kind of sat in with the band several times, so I got to know Joe in practices and playing gigs.
[02:43:07.877 --> 02:43:13.763]  Very mild-mannered guy, very clean-cut guy by South Austin standards.
[02:43:13.783 --> 02:43:20.650]  South Austin people usually are a little more rag-tag type group.
[02:43:20.690 --> 02:43:21.491]  Longer hair and stuff.
[02:43:21.531 --> 02:43:24.074]  And Joe, always button-up shirt.
[02:43:24.474 --> 02:43:24.955]  I'm good.
[02:43:41.332 --> 02:43:45.155]  You know, when you look at different people, you know, some people don't look like they have their stuff together.
[02:43:45.195 --> 02:43:56.902]  Well, Joe always looked like he had his stuff together and that's, um, I was kind of shocked when I first heard, um, you know, when I put two and two together, like this is the Joe Stack that I knew.
[02:43:56.922 --> 02:43:59.985]  I was, I was really shocked because I didn't think this guy would,
[02:44:00.905 --> 02:44:02.006]  Ever do anything like this.
[02:44:02.066 --> 02:44:05.087]  I mean, it's really out of character for him.
[02:44:05.107 --> 02:44:18.213]  And I mean, I think we just need to start asking the questions, especially, you know, what what would drive somebody to do something like this if he is indeed, you know, the lone wolf type, what would make him what would put some push somebody to the brink to do this?
[02:44:18.473 --> 02:44:24.014]  Well everybody's saying that he was an amazing musician and we did get the video working.
[02:44:24.195 --> 02:44:26.495]  It was working fine and then as soon as we went live it wouldn't play.
[02:44:27.015 --> 02:44:28.116]  But thanks for getting that ready.
[02:44:28.696 --> 02:44:30.756]  But other musician friends of his are on the news.
[02:44:30.776 --> 02:44:33.737]  There's other video of him at events.
[02:44:34.497 --> 02:44:36.658]  But again, everybody
[02:44:37.418 --> 02:44:39.619]  Is going with the line, oh he did this on purpose.
[02:44:40.299 --> 02:44:41.980]  We've seen so many false flags.
[02:44:42.300 --> 02:44:48.022]  If a government's done false flags over and over again and been caught doing it, we have to investigate this as a possible false flag.
[02:44:48.322 --> 02:44:50.482]  It is being blamed on the Tea Parties and Alex Jones.
[02:44:50.882 --> 02:44:51.123]  Right.
[02:44:52.923 --> 02:44:54.704]  I've been looking at stuff on this all morning.
[02:44:54.764 --> 02:45:00.826]  There's some video out there, the same girl who talks about the hazmat vehicles and the fire trucks being right nearby.
[02:45:01.366 --> 02:45:07.228]  She also says she was close enough, she didn't see a pilot, and she was close enough to where she could have seen a pilot.
[02:45:07.288 --> 02:45:11.249]  She says it on one of these CNN clip that I sent to
[02:45:12.089 --> 02:45:15.052]  And they had technology 50 years ago to remote control a plane.
[02:45:15.072 --> 02:45:19.956]  They could have burned his house down, killed him, stuck him in the plane, or buried him somewhere.
[02:45:19.996 --> 02:45:22.418]  Some people are saying maybe he staged his death.
[02:45:22.738 --> 02:45:33.627]  You know, Northwood says they have CIA agents get on board an aircraft with the same tail numbers and same make, take it off, land it, take another one off that looks similar, and blow it up.
[02:45:33.687 --> 02:45:34.108]  A drone.
[02:45:34.128 --> 02:45:37.290]  I mean, we have a government plan to do this with airplanes.
[02:45:37.350 --> 02:45:38.812]  So we have to look at this.
[02:45:39.355 --> 02:45:49.497]  I mean I think it's very important to ask the questions and look and definitely find out how the IRS is investigating this guy and at least look into that.
[02:45:49.537 --> 02:45:51.318]  I got a couple tips today.
[02:45:51.338 --> 02:46:00.380]  One guy said that apparently one of his neighbors right adjacent to him is an IRS employee who actually worked in that building.
[02:46:02.453 --> 02:46:04.754]  That's not confirmed, but we got sent that this morning.
[02:46:04.774 --> 02:46:05.914]  Now, you went out to his house.
[02:46:06.154 --> 02:46:06.375]  Yeah.
[02:46:06.495 --> 02:46:08.055]  Well, I mean, anything else about Joe Stack?
[02:46:08.135 --> 02:46:09.315]  I mean, what would you talk to him about?
[02:46:09.696 --> 02:46:17.578]  I mean, we always talked music, and I didn't get too personal with him other than, you know, general stuff, but he was always there, always on time, and always happy.
[02:46:17.598 --> 02:46:22.840]  I always saw him, you know, he was serious when he's playing, because you're really concentrating, but afterwards he was smiling.
[02:46:23.300 --> 02:46:27.301]  He didn't really drink or smoke or do anything like that.
[02:46:28.061 --> 02:46:30.162]  He just seemed to be a pretty clean-cut guy who was
[02:46:30.222 --> 02:46:33.705]  People say it was really smart, very precise, totally squared away.
[02:46:33.725 --> 02:46:34.145]  Yeah.
[02:46:34.565 --> 02:46:36.006]  He looks very focused.
[02:46:36.026 --> 02:46:36.967]  I mean, he looks intelligent.
[02:46:37.167 --> 02:46:38.568]  Yeah, he was very intelligent.
[02:46:38.608 --> 02:46:43.452]  We actually played a few of his own compositions that he wrote, and they were, you know, they weren't easy.
[02:46:43.492 --> 02:46:44.553]  They were pretty difficult.
[02:46:44.593 --> 02:46:50.857]  They were kind of jazz rock type stuff, which seemed to be the vein of music he really liked playing, was sort of a jazz rock, you know.
[02:46:50.917 --> 02:46:55.221]  He liked the upbeat stuff, but with, you know, more interesting chords than what you would find in a blues.
[02:46:55.241 --> 02:46:56.382]  What were his favorite bands?
[02:46:57.962 --> 02:47:07.064]  Well, I know he was a big Steely Dan fan, because we actually played a few Steely Dan songs, and that's one band that I can bring off the top of my head.
[02:47:07.104 --> 02:47:10.445]  I can't remember any other bands offhand.
[02:47:11.345 --> 02:47:13.886]  He wasn't a tall guy.
[02:47:13.926 --> 02:47:19.507]  He was kind of short compared to me, but he was carrying in these huge pianos all the time for practice.
[02:47:19.547 --> 02:47:25.248]  He'd walk in with them and drop them down and get his stuff set up, and talking the whole time while he was doing it.
[02:47:25.888 --> 02:47:29.551]  You know, I never saw him get angry at anybody.
[02:47:29.831 --> 02:47:35.295]  If we had disagreements with something, you know, in terms of, like, a song, you know, we'd just sit and talk about it.
[02:47:35.375 --> 02:47:37.477]  And you never heard him talk bad about the government?
[02:47:37.537 --> 02:47:37.737]  Never.
[02:47:37.937 --> 02:47:39.738]  You know, I never heard him get political.
[02:47:39.778 --> 02:47:45.543]  The band wasn't, they weren't really, they were older guys with kids and they were more just, you know, trying to put bread on the table.
[02:47:45.623 --> 02:47:46.704]  How long ago did you know him?
[02:47:47.564 --> 02:47:54.729]  I think I met him in the mid-2000s, and I haven't seen him in about at least a year, maybe two years.
[02:47:55.810 --> 02:48:01.073]  But I've talked to people who had seen him a couple weeks ago and said he was fine.
[02:48:01.093 --> 02:48:03.255]  They were working on recording sessions together.
[02:48:03.855 --> 02:48:11.704]  So, it's really sad that in that short amount of time, you know, a guy could get pushed like that to the brink if that's, you know, what happened.
[02:48:11.844 --> 02:48:19.854]  And, you know, I don't know if, we'll probably never know what the IRS knows because they're probably not going to divulge their... And you shot this video we were just watching.
[02:48:20.208 --> 02:48:20.928]  Yeah, that was shot in 2007.
[02:48:20.988 --> 02:48:24.950]  So, that was about three years ago.
[02:48:25.210 --> 02:48:25.990]  What bar was that?
[02:48:26.551 --> 02:48:28.952]  I think it was called Green Lights On, and we were setting up lights.
[02:48:28.972 --> 02:48:34.634]  They had no lights there, so me and my brother were shooting the video, and we set up a bunch of lights so, you know, they would look, you know, like a band.
[02:48:34.654 --> 02:48:36.335]  Did you play in one band with him, or multiple?
[02:48:37.075 --> 02:48:42.057]  It was just one band that I would sub on bass for, and he was the main keyboard player there.
[02:48:42.097 --> 02:48:43.378]  But, you know, he also played bass.
[02:48:43.398 --> 02:48:47.720]  He was a real good bass player, and he played bass in several bands, I know that.
[02:48:47.920 --> 02:48:53.202]  And someone, I never knew he played accordion, but apparently he was an accordion player too, which doesn't surprise me.
[02:48:53.242 --> 02:48:54.963]  The guy was, you know, multi-talented.
[02:48:54.983 --> 02:48:56.144]  He was a real smart guy.
[02:48:56.604 --> 02:48:59.205]  And he was also reportedly a really good pilot and flew a lot.
[02:48:59.545 --> 02:49:01.767]  Yeah, he flew bands around.
[02:49:01.787 --> 02:49:14.996]  He had that plane for many years, I think, before he moved to Austin, and the guy that was the band leader of the band I was in, he said, you know, I've flown in that plane down to San Antonio.
[02:49:18.058 --> 02:49:18.618]  Nice guy.
[02:49:18.638 --> 02:49:20.279]  I can't believe.
[02:49:20.299 --> 02:49:21.359]  I'm really in shock.
[02:49:21.399 --> 02:49:23.940]  And I was really in shock yesterday when I pulled it up.
[02:49:23.960 --> 02:49:25.441]  Because I knew I knew a Joe Stack.
[02:49:26.221 --> 02:49:27.761]  But everybody was saying Andrew Joe Stack.
[02:49:27.801 --> 02:49:29.562]  So you're thinking Andrew Stack the whole time.
[02:49:30.042 --> 02:49:33.203]  And I'm asking people out in his neighborhood, you know, did you know this guy?
[02:49:33.223 --> 02:49:33.783]  Did you know this guy?
[02:49:33.803 --> 02:49:34.924]  Well, it turns out I knew the guy.
[02:49:36.024 --> 02:49:40.108]  And it turned out, though, the neighbors were like, we would have talked to you, but we've made a commitment not to talk now.
[02:49:40.288 --> 02:49:40.429]  Right.
[02:49:40.469 --> 02:49:45.614]  There was one neighbor that did not want, he said he was morally and ethically obligated not to talk to us.
[02:49:46.415 --> 02:49:48.837]  And here's something else that's interesting.
[02:49:48.857 --> 02:49:52.421]  Another guy who works, I work for the IRS in Austin.
[02:49:52.461 --> 02:49:54.303]  He said they had a guy from D.C.
[02:49:54.343 --> 02:49:57.086]  come in and was talking about, they kept calling it an accident.
[02:49:57.586 --> 02:50:00.948]  Wait a minute, in that same building, they're talking about sheltering in place the day before?
[02:50:23.098 --> 02:50:26.301]  Yeah, no, he doesn't say it was the exact same building, so I'm going to confirm this.
[02:50:26.341 --> 02:50:26.801]  Calling.
[02:50:26.821 --> 02:50:27.542]  This is something we need to know.
[02:50:27.582 --> 02:50:28.643]  Yeah, and the source needs to know.
[02:50:28.823 --> 02:50:29.043]  Right.
[02:50:29.083 --> 02:50:30.164]  We're not going to say who they are.
[02:50:30.184 --> 02:50:30.425]  No.
[02:50:30.625 --> 02:50:37.331]  Again, we have a comment line that people can call us at 512-646-4444.
[02:50:38.011 --> 02:50:39.192]  It's only a one-minute message.
[02:50:39.212 --> 02:50:39.953]  Leave your name and number.
[02:50:39.973 --> 02:50:42.495]  Only serious calls.
[02:50:43.476 --> 02:50:48.458]  And we'll have more for you on Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., and then obviously back on Monday.
[02:50:48.478 --> 02:50:50.118]  But we're going to come back with more straight ahead.
[02:50:50.178 --> 02:50:50.778]  Final segment.
[02:50:51.239 --> 02:50:56.600]  For safety, you lock doors, set alarms, buy antivirus software, maybe even have a watchdog.
[02:50:56.700 --> 02:50:58.721]  Do you care as much about your air and water?
[02:50:59.001 --> 02:51:01.942]  Lock out harmful poisons from entering your body with Air and Aqua.
[02:51:02.142 --> 02:51:03.082]  We're good to go.
[02:51:20.749 --> 02:51:30.035]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:51:30.075 --> 02:51:30.815]  This capitalism?
[02:51:30.855 --> 02:51:36.999]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:51:37.119 --> 02:51:37.959]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:51:37.999 --> 02:51:41.061]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[02:51:41.241 --> 02:51:42.142]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:51:42.182 --> 02:51:45.843]  It's time to understand the system.

[02:51:47.624 --> 02:51:50.346]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:51:52.467 --> 02:51:56.128]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:51:56.489 --> 02:51:59.490]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:51:59.730 --> 02:52:01.131]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:52:01.849 --> 02:52:04.510]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:04.530 --> 02:52:10.733]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:10.914 --> 02:52:15.956]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:16.456 --> 02:52:26.081]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:26.201 --> 02:52:28.303]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:28.543 --> 02:52:29.885]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:30.145 --> 02:52:32.427]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:32.607 --> 02:52:34.429]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:34.729 --> 02:52:39.534]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:54:04.159 --> 02:54:10.341]  30 minutes to an hour before, we will go live on the internet streams and PrisonPlanet.tv viewers only.
[02:54:11.161 --> 02:54:14.362]  It's obviously, with the way AM and FM stations work, they can't just flip over to it.
[02:54:18.240 --> 02:54:19.740]  I'm not going to have time to go to any more calls.
[02:54:19.800 --> 02:54:24.202]  I want Rob to be able to finish up, and I need to plug one more of our great sponsors that makes this radio show possible.
[02:54:24.222 --> 02:54:28.963]  If you want to check out their website, they have all the studies and info there at supernaturalsilver.com.
[02:54:29.283 --> 02:54:30.283]  That's one word.
[02:54:31.044 --> 02:54:31.804]  Are you prepared?
[02:54:31.824 --> 02:54:34.645]  Do you have what you need for you and your loved ones through a crisis?
[02:54:34.685 --> 02:54:36.005]  There's one weapon everybody should have.
[02:54:36.345 --> 02:54:38.165]  Okay, Rob, I've been asking some questions.
[02:54:38.185 --> 02:54:40.526]  Anything else you want to add in this small world?
[02:54:40.546 --> 02:54:41.646]  You turned out to know Joe Stack.
[02:55:05.592 --> 02:55:13.176]  Everything I've heard about him and conflicting stories from the family and all this weirdness, my gut tells me there's some hanky-panky going on here.
[02:55:13.636 --> 02:55:20.980]  And now this IRS letter, all these calls, witnesses, the TV news, them being in place beforehand, sheltering in place, all this.
[02:55:23.221 --> 02:55:27.564]  Looks like it was written for people that want to have war to go, yeah, let's go and maybe try to start something.
[02:55:27.904 --> 02:55:31.506]  I'm not sure about that, but I've been saying Austin's going to be the target, haven't I?
[02:55:33.627 --> 02:55:47.551]  One thing will be interesting is to find out when the, exactly when the fire department was called for this fire because he apparently drove from his house about 25 miles north to the airport to pick up this fire.
[02:55:47.571 --> 02:55:48.171]  During rush hour traffic.
[02:55:48.191 --> 02:55:49.131]  During rush hour traffic.
[02:55:49.191 --> 02:55:50.791]  And North Austin is locked up.
[02:55:50.851 --> 02:55:51.452]  It's horrible.
[02:55:52.072 --> 02:55:54.632]  And, you know, anywhere in Austin, pretty much on the highways.
[02:55:55.333 --> 02:55:56.793]  So unless he had some, you know,
[02:55:58.400 --> 02:56:00.521]  I can't see him getting there that quickly.
[02:56:15.265 --> 02:56:15.485]  Right.
[02:56:16.266 --> 02:56:16.786]  Yeah, that could be.
[02:56:16.806 --> 02:56:17.427]  So he could have done it.
[02:56:18.067 --> 02:56:24.831]  And I talked to a neighbor that said she left her house at 8.45 in the morning and apparently the fire was going then, although she didn't see it.
[02:56:25.072 --> 02:56:27.713]  And by the time she got to work, her cell phone was going nuts.
[02:56:27.833 --> 02:56:29.835]  You know, people calling her saying, there's a fire in your neighborhood.
[02:56:29.875 --> 02:56:30.875]  There's a fire in your neighborhood.
[02:56:31.316 --> 02:56:32.657]  Oh, so others have said around 9.
[02:56:32.697 --> 02:56:36.819]  Yeah, she said she went to work at 8.45 that morning and she didn't see it.
[02:56:36.839 --> 02:56:38.821]  Well, why would the family already be out of the house?
[02:56:40.282 --> 02:56:40.562]  Yeah.
[02:56:40.622 --> 02:56:41.883]  Why were the police not called?
[02:56:42.617 --> 02:56:43.158]  I don't know.
[02:56:44.339 --> 02:56:48.704]  From things I've read, I've heard some reports is some guy, a neighbor helped him out of the house.
[02:56:48.764 --> 02:56:54.691]  Another report was that they were at a hotel the night before and came home and found it that way.
[02:56:55.231 --> 02:57:00.157]  So, you know, I think a lot will come out when they interview his wife.
[02:57:00.477 --> 02:57:02.880]  I wonder why the cops would tell the neighbors not to talk to people.
[02:57:03.860 --> 02:57:07.382]  That's very interesting, because you'd think they would, you know, let him be open to the press.
[02:57:07.422 --> 02:57:17.046]  And some people did talk to the press, but the one guy that was really, you know, sharply dressed, let's just go ahead and use that term, didn't want to talk to us, and he was a younger guy.
[02:57:17.627 --> 02:57:22.789]  So, you know, that'll be interesting to see, you know, if he talks to anybody in the future.
[02:57:22.809 --> 02:57:25.631]  I remember what he looks like, and so we'll be able to know.
[02:57:25.671 --> 02:57:28.352]  But the neighbors around him seemed to be, you know, older.
[02:57:28.412 --> 02:57:31.373]  There was the one younger lady that I talked to that left at 845 that morning.
[02:57:32.954 --> 02:57:34.074]  I don't know.
[02:57:48.399 --> 02:57:53.984]  Put my heart and prayers out to them, and I hope somebody can maybe put something... And I've seen different numbers.
[02:57:54.365 --> 02:57:57.708]  One person missing, including him, and then two injured.
[02:57:58.028 --> 02:57:58.849]  Did he kill anybody?
[02:57:59.429 --> 02:58:02.132]  I think they did pull out two bodies total.
[02:58:02.172 --> 02:58:05.215]  They think one's his and one is somebody who they haven't identified yet.
[02:58:06.201 --> 02:58:10.084]  So that'll be interesting to see, you know, the identity of that person.
[02:58:10.104 --> 02:58:11.805]  Well, you said reporters on the scene, though.
[02:58:11.965 --> 02:58:14.206]  We're going, how did the police know so much so soon?
[02:58:14.587 --> 02:58:15.667]  That's also suspicious.
[02:58:15.727 --> 02:58:22.572]  But Retransmission starts now with an incredible special guest, James Traficant.
[02:58:22.612 --> 02:58:24.613]  This interview was off the charts, powerful.

[02:58:30.597 --> 02:58:31.038]  Best ever.
[02:58:31.078 --> 02:58:31.418]  Great job.
[02:58:36.582 --> 02:58:37.766]  They are the best.
[02:58:37.826 --> 02:58:39.210]  Best crew I've ever had.
[02:58:39.250 --> 02:58:40.213]  Great job.
[02:58:40.634 --> 02:58:41.095]  Yeah!
[02:58:41.156 --> 02:58:44.204]  One major world crisis away from having eight.
