[00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:08.394]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:08.534 --> 00:00:21.902]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we're now simulcasting the second half of this Monday, June 21st, 2010, radio transmission at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:21.982 --> 00:00:26.445]  So if you want to see us in living color, not just hear us on the radio, go over to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:31.410]  Of course, the other websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:43.804]  Rahm Emanuel expected to quit White House, stepping down as corruption scandals intensify surrounding him, like BP paying for his million-dollar-a-year apartment for many, many years.
[00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:45.547]  Or million-dollar apartment.
[00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:46.807]  U.S.
[00:00:46.967 --> 00:00:51.690]  Israeli warships and Suez may be prelude to face off with Iran.
[00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.951]  This out of the Israeli National News.
[00:00:54.551 --> 00:01:02.575]  Arutz Shaviv, or Shiva, continuing, that's also in her writs, as well as her Jerusalem Post, are reporting on the same development.
[00:01:02.915 --> 00:01:03.796]  Armada of U.S.
[00:01:03.836 --> 00:01:06.237]  and Israeli warships head for Iran.
[00:01:06.257 --> 00:01:07.517]  More than 12 U.S.
[00:01:07.577 --> 00:01:10.319]  and Israeli warships, including an aircraft carrier,
[00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:15.983]  Passed through the Suez Canal last Friday and are headed for the Red Sea, according to eyewitnesses.
[00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:16.723]  The U.S.
[00:01:16.763 --> 00:01:22.187]  battleships were the largest to have crossed the canal in many years, reported a London-based newspaper.
[00:01:22.587 --> 00:01:32.534]  The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported Egyptian opposition members criticized the government for cooperating with the United States and Israeli forces in allowing the passage of the ships through the Egyptian territorial waters.
[00:01:32.854 --> 00:01:36.357]  The Red Sea is the most direct route to the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean.
[00:01:37.645 --> 00:01:44.909]  Meanwhile, we have an InfoWars.com article that quotes Fars News Agency and Press TV.
[00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.392]  Iran threatens to stop Western ships if subjected to cargo inspection.
[00:01:49.732 --> 00:01:50.553]  We warn the U.S.
[00:01:50.593 --> 00:02:05.322]  and certain adventurous countries that if they are tempted to inspect Iranian air and ship cargoes, we will take tough action against their ships in the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman, said the Iranian parliament speaker.
[00:02:06.162 --> 00:02:07.983]  And it continues, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:14.186]  We'll be discussing that with Max Keiser.
[00:02:14.906 --> 00:02:22.390]  Also, we've got an article up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that I'm asking listeners to take action on today.
[00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:45.614]  Instead of letting Bobby Jindal complain and Haley Barber complain of Mississippi, instead of just letting the governor of Florida complain about the feds blocking now, for 60 plus days, relief barges, foreign countries, the Dutch, the Norwegians and others, and the Coast Guard going out and blocking state vessels from even putting up berms in front of estuaries,
[00:02:46.175 --> 00:02:50.999]  We need to have the states declare 9th and 10th Amendment powers, and go out and just push the Coast Guard aside.
[00:02:51.359 --> 00:03:14.978]  Say, look, you're engaged in treason, you don't have jurisdiction, for 10 miles into the estuaries and the wetlands, the Coast Guard says they now control the state land, and aren't letting people fish, they aren't letting them remove oil, because you've got to have a permit to basically wipe your nose in this country, because the Fed mafia has to control everything, and contracts to clean it up can only be given to White House cronies like Halliburton and others.
[00:03:16.598 --> 00:03:17.818]  But that's a side issue.
[00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:41.826]  We know now from the Coast Guard hearings with the survivors of the rigs and the head engineers, not just with BP, but Halliburton and the other companies that were out there, there were upwards of five companies working as contractors on the rig, that they told two months before, a month before, two weeks before, a week before, a few days before, and hours before, that's BBC, Associated Press, we have them all listed on my websites,
[00:03:42.426 --> 00:03:55.989]  That it was going to blow up, the well was going to come in and ignite, it was full of methane, gas, and other variants of natural gas, that they were dumping seawater into the 30,000 foot hole, never before done to supposedly pressurize it.
[00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:03.770]  She water weighs, what, you know, nine pounds a gallon instead of 15, 16, 17 for the mud or concrete they inject in.
[00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:07.251]  And I've gone and researched the engineering on this.
[00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:11.472]  The engineers said this will blow up, but BP said go ahead and do it.
[00:04:12.895 --> 00:04:16.838]  That's because they are the key globalist funding the carbon tax.
[00:04:17.119 --> 00:04:24.065]  Their whole carbon tax is in trouble and there is no doubt this is a strategic attack to bring that carbon tax in.
[00:04:24.565 --> 00:04:26.327]  Now we'll see if Max Keiser agrees with us.
[00:04:26.787 --> 00:04:33.613]  He of course brought out the fact that Goldman Sachs and others engaged a few months ago in financial terrorism with that thousand point ten minute drop.
[00:04:33.933 --> 00:04:36.335]  Later it came out that indeed they were in there manipulating.
[00:04:37.356 --> 00:04:39.398]  But I haven't asked Max his view on this.
[00:04:39.438 --> 00:04:44.281]  We'll see what he thinks about the BP slash Obama situation and where this is going.
[00:04:44.541 --> 00:04:50.065]  Then we're going to talk to Max about the Iran situation and other things that the BP disaster is a distraction for.
[00:04:50.526 --> 00:04:53.708]  And then we'll talk about something that even bowled me over.
[00:04:54.773 --> 00:05:04.962]  The FCC had said they wanted to regulate the internet, and tax it, and tax alternative news, to fund a quote, government megaphone, government media, and to fund old line media that's dying.
[00:05:05.682 --> 00:05:06.883]  That had been in the old proposal.
[00:05:07.263 --> 00:05:21.816]  They came out Friday, it's in the AP, Financial Times of London, they have links to the FCC proposal, which is what they want to implement, a black box in your house that watches everything you do on TV and internet, all wired through it, whether it's cable, satellite, doesn't matter,
[00:05:23.534 --> 00:05:26.526]  And it surveils you, and it blocks what you can get.
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:40.730]  And then it takes over the ISPs, we already knew about that, with cyber security, where all ISPs, with a hundred or more customers, that's all ISPs out there, Internet Service Providers, everything must be wired through on their end in government equipment.
[00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:54.761]  I work in radio, in 96 under the Telecommunications Act, they said that all radio and TV stations, the final piece of equipment at the transmitter, and I know engineers hate them because they add noise into the chain on radio and TV,
[00:05:55.902 --> 00:06:09.270]  Because you've got to put this federal piece that's shortwave radio controlled where they can dial in and take over and just put a red screen up via computer command on TV and have shortwave broadcast with government announcements on it.
[00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:10.670]  But I digress.
[00:06:11.291 --> 00:06:14.693]  All ISPs, your home, everything will have this control box.
[00:06:15.593 --> 00:06:17.974]  Let's now go to Max Keiser Report.
[00:06:18.034 --> 00:06:25.617]  He has a program on Russia Today, BBC, Press TV, Radio in London, and this guy is everywhere.
[00:06:25.937 --> 00:06:26.857]  Needs no introduction.
[00:06:27.298 --> 00:06:29.578]  Here with us, and he'll be with us a little bit into the next hour.
[00:06:29.898 --> 00:06:31.519]  Max Keiser, great to have you here with us.
[00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:34.120]  Alex Jones, good to be back!
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.901]  Well, you just heard that rant.
[00:06:35.981 --> 00:06:36.821]  What's your take on it?
[00:06:38.222 --> 00:06:44.304]  Well, to follow up on what we talked about back on the 1,000-point crash on May 6th,
[00:06:45.642 --> 00:06:49.324]  On your show, we talked about it in terms of being a domestic financial terrorist attack.
[00:06:49.685 --> 00:06:56.049]  Now, since that time, just on June 17th, I'm reading a report here, there was another of these attacks.
[00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:59.851]  The Washington Post stock doubled in five minutes.
[00:07:00.683 --> 00:07:12.471]  And this was yet another one of these attacks by program traders and high frequency traders on Wall Street that are using their technology to manipulate markets.
[00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:16.453]  And so now, as I predicted, you would see more of these attacks.
[00:07:16.993 --> 00:07:25.659]  And going forward, you will see many, many more of these types of events where prices are skyrocketing or plummeting in two or three minutes.
[00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:27.020]  Well, continue, Max.
[00:07:48.467 --> 00:07:56.754]  Put in these enormous market-moving program trades that nobody is doing anything to really stop.
[00:07:57.355 --> 00:08:08.725]  And they put lots of money into the pockets of the same people who are financing all the elections and putting in the folks in Washington that we are further deregulating these markets.
[00:08:09.145 --> 00:08:11.568]  Now to move over to the BP situation.
[00:08:13.069 --> 00:08:29.126]  You know, this is remarkably, the Wall Street Journal, I think this is important to get into the thinking here, the Wall Street Journal on June 15th, their take on it, check this out, they said, the oil spill may end up lifting the GDP slightly.
[00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:31.784]  You see, Alex, it's not a catastrophe.
[00:08:32.004 --> 00:08:37.411]  It's actually an economic benefit for the people of the region and for the country.
[00:08:37.471 --> 00:08:39.494]  It's command destruction.
[00:08:39.534 --> 00:08:44.361]  Just like we're in depression, but the top six bank stocks are up, so they tell us the economy's good.
[00:08:45.307 --> 00:08:51.849]  Right, according to JPMorgan Chase, the continuing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico should end up adding growth to the U.S.
[00:08:51.929 --> 00:09:00.232]  economy as a huge cleanup effort are going to outweigh the negative factors like the one million permanent job loss
[00:09:00.652 --> 00:09:09.936]  The eco-terrorist catastrophe, the loss of that entire region, and the dead zone that will result as a result of this.
[00:09:10.276 --> 00:09:12.777]  So this is the type of thinking that we're battling.
[00:09:12.837 --> 00:09:15.178]  It's perpetrated by the Wall Street Journal.
[00:09:15.378 --> 00:09:21.580]  This idea that everything adds to GDP growth, like an ecological disaster, like a war in Iraq.
[00:09:23.561 --> 00:09:29.343]  All the trillion dollar defense budget, it all ends up adding to the GDP, and we should be celebrating it.
[00:09:29.423 --> 00:09:36.865]  The fact that it's ruining the economy and causing massive unemployment and massive social unrest, that's not a problem.
[00:09:36.905 --> 00:09:50.589]  As a matter of fact, the social unrest is going to equal more GDP growth as well, because after all, a lot of people are going to be out there buying placards, protesting the government, and probably buying little drums to beat and little drum circles.
[00:09:50.829 --> 00:10:03.372]  But Max, what about my idea to have people lobby for grand jury investigations at the state level because we know the feds are bought and paid for by BP and Goldman Sachs that of course owns a lot of BP and formerly chaired it just a few months ago.
[00:10:03.972 --> 00:10:06.473]  The head of Goldman Sachs also co-chaired BP as you know.
[00:10:07.053 --> 00:10:09.214]  Some of the public may not be aware of that so I throw that in.
[00:10:09.794 --> 00:10:12.895]  I mean what about criminal negligence because we know now
[00:10:13.755 --> 00:10:27.231]  According to the Coast Guard hearings, with the survivors and the head engineers, that BP ordered them to do things that had never been done before, and that they said, this is going to blow up, and BP said, we don't care, do it, and this went on for two months.
[00:10:27.311 --> 00:10:29.874]  They kept saying, it's going to blow up, it's going to blow up.
[00:10:30.154 --> 00:10:33.699]  Don't we need a criminal investigation to find out exactly what happened here?
[00:10:35.066 --> 00:10:37.749]  Well, I don't have any faith in the political process whatsoever.
[00:10:38.109 --> 00:10:41.733]  And on the economics, here's where the math gets really dodgy.
[00:10:42.133 --> 00:10:45.556]  In other words, the government says that we're going to fine BP $20 billion.
[00:10:45.596 --> 00:10:51.762]  Now what BP did the next day is they announced that Goldman Sachs is going to raise $20 billion new dollars for them.
[00:10:51.782 --> 00:10:57.067]  They're going to sell $20 to $50 billion in new bonds, thanks to Goldman Sachs and Wall Street bankers.
[00:10:57.888 --> 00:11:07.233]  So they're going to totally pay for this by borrowing money, which, when the bets go bad, when they try to hedge those new offerings, of course, that'll end up being another bailout.
[00:11:07.314 --> 00:11:07.854]  So the U.S.
[00:11:07.874 --> 00:11:09.455]  public is going to end up bailing out them, too.
[00:11:09.475 --> 00:11:21.702]  Yeah, they're going to make money on the way up, investing it in a new derivative, and then when it bankrupts, the feds will come in and pay $50 billion, $100 billion, who knows what it'll be by then, into this new Madoff-type scheme.
[00:11:22.341 --> 00:11:36.546]  Right, so you get 20 billion of new bombs that'll just go a channel into the damage fund, but of course to pave the interest on that, BP will actually lower their operating standards and the risk of another event just like this actually went up because there's no punitive damage.
[00:11:37.127 --> 00:11:46.490]  All they're doing is they're trying to make it into a slap on the wrist, which they won't even pay, they'll get someone else to pay for it on Wall Street, but to pay the interest they're going to lower their operating standards and increase the risk of another
[00:11:47.709 --> 00:11:49.572]  Max Keiser, stay there.
[00:11:49.592 --> 00:11:53.737]  We're going to come back and get into internet censorship and phone calls.
[00:11:53.757 --> 00:11:54.238]  Stay with us.
[00:11:57.703 --> 00:11:58.824]  This is not a drill.
[00:11:58.924 --> 00:12:00.847]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:03.472]  We're good.
[00:12:21.715 --> 00:12:22.315]  We're good to go!

[00:15:59.309 --> 00:16:14.334]  By the way, I forgot to add, not only does he have BBC TV shows, British radio shows and the rest of it, Max Keiser is now joining the GCN Radio Network with a multi-hour program Saturday mornings at 9 a.m.
[00:16:16.275 --> 00:16:19.797]  It's the Truth About Markets, USA, Saturday, 9 a.m.
[00:16:19.837 --> 00:16:20.177]  Central.
[00:16:20.617 --> 00:16:25.740]  All right, Max, this is a short segment, but just give me your bottom line, in your gut.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:32.323]  You've got Goldman Sachs dumping 44% of its stock the week before, and of course we know that they were.
[00:16:33.203 --> 00:16:37.587]  At the time, their chairman was also the chairman of BP, and then they made this shuffle right before.
[00:16:37.867 --> 00:16:43.411]  They dumped 44% of their BP stock when other oil stocks were way up.
[00:16:43.611 --> 00:16:47.254]  We also have the CEO dumping over a third of his stock the week before.
[00:16:47.514 --> 00:16:55.400]  We have Halliburton buying this cleanup company that is focused on the Gulf of Mexico in the weeks before.
[00:16:56.321 --> 00:16:59.043]  You have the fact that Obama now has called for the carbon tax.
[00:16:59.063 --> 00:17:00.404]  This is a nice political diversion.
[00:17:01.445 --> 00:17:06.387]  We know that BP ordered them to do things that they've never done before that they knew would blow up.
[00:17:07.507 --> 00:17:09.148]  You never let a good crisis go to waste.
[00:17:10.508 --> 00:17:19.331]  Every way I look at this, this is an inside job, Max Keiser, to get the new global carbon tax to prop up the new SDR system.
[00:17:20.672 --> 00:17:26.994]  Well, on the trading of BP stock, as you know, I've worked on Wall Street for many years.
[00:17:27.074 --> 00:17:29.675]  I know many, if not all, of the tricks that
[00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:31.889]  Brokers and bankers can play.
[00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:38.357]  It's not difficult to predate or post-date a trade.
[00:17:38.977 --> 00:17:42.522]  So in other words, they say that they sold their stock before the event.
[00:17:43.328 --> 00:17:56.456]  It's not difficult to actually sell the stock after the event and then to monkey around with the reporting and with the compliance and to basically commit a bit of accounting fraud.
[00:17:57.036 --> 00:18:03.540]  So that was my first thought, that the dates that they give for their sales were probably cooked.
[00:18:04.491 --> 00:18:07.354]  Uh, just to, because they figured that they can do it.
[00:18:07.875 --> 00:18:14.564]  Uh, there's nobody pushing back on the regulatory front, and fraud is the core business model of Wall Street.
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.903]  But let's move beyond that.
[00:18:18.323 --> 00:18:24.228]  Let's say that they had pre-knowledge and they were dumping their shares ahead of this.
[00:18:24.248 --> 00:18:34.317]  A lot of the intelligence that flows into the trading desks and the hedge funds on Wall Street comes from sources that are not publicly available.
[00:18:34.337 --> 00:18:36.039]  That's why the system is horribly
[00:18:36.619 --> 00:18:45.168]  Well, yeah, the entire NSA CIA has admitted not just spying on us, but getting intel and economic information to feed to the insiders.
[00:18:45.749 --> 00:18:47.550]  And first it was two weeks, then a month.
[00:18:47.591 --> 00:18:52.756]  Now, two months out, they knew this thing was already leaking, having problems, and was probably going to blow.
[00:18:53.256 --> 00:18:55.399]  And so, I mean, there you have it right there.
[00:18:56.206 --> 00:18:59.487]  Well, the computers run algorithms.
[00:18:59.507 --> 00:19:02.587]  The algorithms in the computer programs actually are able to read the news.
[00:19:02.647 --> 00:19:06.988]  You know, computers read the news now, and they interpret intelligence, and they can interpret data.
[00:19:07.188 --> 00:19:11.029]  And they put the trades in automatically, so it bypasses a human element.
[00:19:11.369 --> 00:19:12.529]  The computers just trade.
[00:19:12.929 --> 00:19:14.990]  And the computers put on a massive amount of trades.
[00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:25.992]  And what happens is that you go post-facto, and you pick the trades you want, and you dump the trades you don't want into a slush fund, and then you get the government to bail out the slush fund.
[00:19:26.696 --> 00:19:31.340]  So this is an advanced version of what we used to call a look-back trade on Wall Street.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.761]  So it's an orgy of profit.
[00:19:32.801 --> 00:19:41.789]  They make money when they lose money, they make money when they make money, and they just put it all on us and hire more SWAT teams because they know it's going to blow sky-high.
[00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:57.122]  They put out a massive amount of trade, and they pick the ones they want, and they dump the ones they don't want into a slush fund or an off-balance sheet account until it blows up, and then they get Geithner and Bernanke to bail out that fund.
[00:19:57.182 --> 00:20:01.686]  And they say, well, we never knew it was going to blow up just because we put in all this toxic
[00:20:02.407 --> 00:20:06.092]  I've also read that a lot of stockbrokers have been caught dumping it on their clients.
[00:20:06.432 --> 00:20:09.015]  Like, they trade with their clients' money, not just the big companies.
[00:20:09.035 --> 00:20:13.321]  And then when there's a problem, they dump the losses on their clients and then keep the money for themselves.
[00:20:13.851 --> 00:20:18.433]  Well, the losses are handy for corporations who need tax losses to offset gains.
[00:20:18.513 --> 00:20:22.975]  So this is why less than 50% of the Fortune 500 actually pay taxes.
[00:20:23.315 --> 00:20:29.077]  Because at the end of the year, brokers sell them losing trade to offset their gains for the year.
[00:20:29.097 --> 00:20:30.798]  And that's a big business on Wall Street.
[00:20:30.818 --> 00:20:31.598]  I've done it myself.
[00:20:31.959 --> 00:20:36.280]  You go to the company and you say, I've got a $2 million loss on a trade.
[00:20:36.541 --> 00:20:37.081]  Do you want it?
[00:20:37.161 --> 00:20:38.441]  I can put it in your corporate account.
[00:20:38.761 --> 00:20:39.702]  They'll say, yeah, we'll take it.
[00:20:39.782 --> 00:20:42.303]  You just save them a whole bunch of tax money.
[00:20:43.146 --> 00:20:53.213]  So you have a winning trade and you call up your client and you say, I got a winning trade, and by the way, this is going to cost you per the usual means, and you get a kickback.
[00:20:55.131 --> 00:20:57.412]  Everything is kickbacks, everything is corruption.
[00:20:58.992 --> 00:21:03.853]  That's the problem with you have so many trades and there's so little accounting of the trades.
[00:21:03.893 --> 00:21:13.956]  So you've got hundreds of thousands of trades going on all the time and nobody's actually at the end of the day examining these trades, who's making them, where they're going, and who's accountable for them.
[00:21:14.036 --> 00:21:17.257]  So you have all the industries regulating itself.
[00:21:17.917 --> 00:21:25.418]  And they simply are gaming the system and they're using computer programs to game the system in ever faster ways.
[00:21:25.719 --> 00:21:27.299]  The fraud is speeding up.
[00:21:27.319 --> 00:21:33.980]  Alright Max, we're going to take calls and get into internet censorship when we come back and other topics that you think are important.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.881]  In fact, I haven't asked Max yet what he thinks is most important right now.
[00:21:36.901 --> 00:21:39.141]  But let's talk about the Iran situation.
[00:21:39.161 --> 00:21:43.562]  The Israeli papers say it looks like the war may be on sooner rather than later.
[00:21:45.652 --> 00:21:48.636]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:21:49.578 --> 00:21:52.262]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:54.949 --> 00:21:59.811]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:21:59.932 --> 00:22:00.672]  What have we got?
[00:22:00.912 --> 00:22:03.033]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:22:03.353 --> 00:22:04.094]  A republic.
[00:22:04.374 --> 00:22:06.935]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:22:07.015 --> 00:22:08.916]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:22:09.276 --> 00:22:11.177]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:22:11.297 --> 00:22:12.578]  So they think they own our land?
[00:22:12.978 --> 00:22:14.099]  They think they own our water?
[00:22:14.299 --> 00:22:14.699]  Children?
[00:22:14.899 --> 00:22:15.699]  Our education?
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:16.640]  Our money?
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:20.502]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:22:20.862 --> 00:22:24.526]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:22:25.848 --> 00:22:26.669]  We have the facts.
[00:22:26.869 --> 00:22:27.990]  We have the Constitution.
[00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:28.912]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:22:28.932 --> 00:22:29.773]  We have common law.
[00:22:29.833 --> 00:22:32.075]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:32.356 --> 00:22:35.059]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[00:22:35.299 --> 00:22:36.120]  Rise of the Republic.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:41.025]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:22:41.185 --> 00:22:42.567]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:22:42.687 --> 00:22:43.528]  Don't tread on me.
[00:22:43.768 --> 00:22:51.155]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.

[00:23:54.574 --> 00:23:58.517]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:23:58.758 --> 00:24:04.803]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:24:05.163 --> 00:24:12.269]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:17.134]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:24:26.084 --> 00:24:29.811]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:24:30.345 --> 00:24:36.509]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:40.512]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:24:41.013 --> 00:24:47.297]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:24:47.357 --> 00:24:48.158]  Thank you.
[00:25:00.769 --> 00:25:03.351]  And I saw Sheriff John Brown!
[00:25:03.411 --> 00:25:06.093]  He was coming to shoot him down!
[00:25:28.931 --> 00:25:29.731]  I mean, what do you do?
[00:25:29.751 --> 00:25:31.572]  Somebody's coming for no reason to kill you.
[00:25:31.672 --> 00:25:32.812]  They can get away with it.
[00:25:32.832 --> 00:25:33.773]  They're a corrupt sheriff.
[00:25:34.893 --> 00:25:36.353]  There you go.
[00:25:36.573 --> 00:25:38.494]  You defend yourself.
[00:25:39.915 --> 00:25:42.936]  But he didn't shoot the deputy.
[00:25:49.008 --> 00:25:50.389]  I mean, think about this society.
[00:25:50.409 --> 00:26:06.460]  You have this giant government out of control robbing us, amassing all this military power, surveillance power, spy power, following the Bible of corruption, the Bible of oppression, the Bible of barbarism.
[00:26:07.921 --> 00:26:17.584]  And we're here, peacefully, trying to wake the people up, trying to wake good people up who are compartmentalizing government, so they can stand up and say no, so that we get our fighting spirit back.
[00:26:17.624 --> 00:26:27.688]  But this go-along-to-get-along attitude, this let-somebody-else-stand-up, let-somebody-else-put-their-head-up-above-the-rocks, let-somebody-else-get-involved, you know, keep your head down.
[00:26:28.088 --> 00:26:30.189]  That attitude is not what built America.
[00:26:31.049 --> 00:26:33.770]  And that attitude is just greasing the skids.
[00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:35.931]  It's inviting the oppressors.
[00:26:38.814 --> 00:26:43.256]  You ever seen like a little skinny guy at a football game or at the mall or in a parking lot?
[00:26:45.156 --> 00:26:52.039]  And bullies will come over right away in high school and start shoving them around, starting to fight with them.
[00:26:53.059 --> 00:26:59.421]  Of course, normally what happens is those little skinny guys turn into badasses, as they say, because they've been beat up so many times.
[00:27:00.022 --> 00:27:06.184]  But the point is, is that you don't want to act like a little scared skinny guy as a society.
[00:27:07.642 --> 00:27:14.688]  You want to commit to stop being cowardly and not just put on the air of being strong.
[00:27:14.748 --> 00:27:15.649]  You need to do it.
[00:27:15.709 --> 00:27:16.870]  I mean, I'm talking to all of you.
[00:27:17.211 --> 00:27:25.078]  You need to be down at your city council this week speaking up against the police state, speaking up against federalization of police, speaking up against
[00:27:25.838 --> 00:27:30.665]  The corruption going on, GMO foods, the impending war with Iran.
[00:27:30.685 --> 00:27:31.947]  You need to be at your statehouse.
[00:27:32.247 --> 00:27:33.469]  You need to drive to your statehouse.
[00:27:33.489 --> 00:27:34.731]  I don't care if it's 200 miles away.
[00:27:34.751 --> 00:27:38.996]  You need to find out who your representative is, your legislator, and go in and talk to them.
[00:27:39.793 --> 00:27:43.996]  You need to set a date a month from now at the local library to have a video screening.
[00:27:44.356 --> 00:27:49.140]  And then put up flyers around town and say, Fall of the Republic screening this Saturday at 5 p.m.
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:53.063]  An important film about the economic implosion and who's behind it.
[00:27:53.163 --> 00:27:54.644]  Or the Obama deception.
[00:27:54.844 --> 00:27:57.026]  Or invisible empire in order to find.
[00:27:58.507 --> 00:28:00.048]  Think about PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:28:00.388 --> 00:28:04.752]  Every subject covered, every guest you can imagine, every issue covered for six and a half years.
[00:28:05.412 --> 00:28:07.054]  Just tens of thousands of pieces of media.
[00:28:07.254 --> 00:28:10.116]  You go in there, you pick what you want, you burn it to CD, you burn it to disk.
[00:28:10.436 --> 00:28:11.898]  It's all there with easy to use tools.
[00:28:12.198 --> 00:28:13.979]  You give that material to people.
[00:28:14.239 --> 00:28:17.522]  You got a wife that's arguing with you about vaccines killing people?
[00:28:17.762 --> 00:28:27.410]  You can go download top brain surgeons, epidemiologists, virologists, scientists, EPA doctors, toxicologists, telling you it's deadly.
[00:28:28.268 --> 00:28:30.148]  You can give that to your wife or your husband.
[00:28:31.649 --> 00:28:37.270]  You want to know about martial law, FEMA camps, we've probably got 20, 30 or more shows in there about it.
[00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:51.713]  We've got police state for the rise of FEMA, the latest up-to-date Pentagon takeover operation, what's happening, a lot of this secret documents that a lot of people put themselves in danger to give us and we put ourselves in danger to publish.
[00:28:53.333 --> 00:28:57.314]  They got death squads after the head of WikiLeaks right now MSNBC is reporting.
[00:29:02.978 --> 00:29:04.182]  According to Daniel Ellsberg.
[00:29:04.203 --> 00:29:07.535]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up and go back to our guest.
[00:29:08.567 --> 00:29:10.408]  Max Keiser, MaxKeiser.com.
[00:29:11.388 --> 00:29:16.111]  Max, I want to go to calls here, but first the Iran situation.
[00:29:16.371 --> 00:29:18.232]  I mean, what concerns you the most in the world?
[00:29:18.692 --> 00:29:27.196]  All the experts I talk to, my common sense, my research of history, watching past events, Israel says they may nuke Iran at any time.
[00:29:27.656 --> 00:29:30.058]  I mean, A, do you think it's coming?
[00:29:30.158 --> 00:29:30.798]  B, when?
[00:29:30.938 --> 00:29:34.540]  And C, what will the aftermath be from your research?
[00:29:36.055 --> 00:29:40.639]  Well, I don't understand why Israel is determining America's foreign policy.
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.080]  When did that happen?
[00:29:42.261 --> 00:29:47.085]  Is Israel America's 51st state, or what's going on there?
[00:29:48.586 --> 00:29:54.411]  In other words, it seems like America's outsourced their foreign policy to AIPAC.
[00:29:55.572 --> 00:29:58.515]  And their interests are not the same as the United States' interests.
[00:29:59.509 --> 00:30:00.490]  It's not the same country.
[00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:01.591]  We don't have the same interests.
[00:30:02.031 --> 00:30:07.134]  They're a small country surrounded by their perceived enemy, and they're extremely paranoid.
[00:30:07.475 --> 00:30:18.782]  Now when you have them, Israelis, formulating America's foreign policy, that paranoia has penetrated the inside of a Washington policymaker.
[00:30:18.802 --> 00:30:25.327]  So America now sees itself as a small, ineffective country surrounded by its perceived enemies.
[00:30:25.387 --> 00:30:26.608]  Where did they get that thought from?
[00:30:27.268 --> 00:30:28.529]  Not from the Founding Fathers.
[00:30:28.569 --> 00:30:29.529]  They got it from Israel.
[00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:31.250]  Well, I think it's more than that.
[00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:38.094]  I mean, they want oil, they want weapons sales, they want to encircle China and Russia, and that's part of Zbigniew Brzezinski's grand strategy.
[00:30:38.114 --> 00:30:46.859]  But I agree, there is a... Well, I mean, you know, the former head of Israeli Defense Forces said we must act like a mad dog so that the Arabs are scared of us.
[00:30:47.179 --> 00:30:48.600]  We've got to be extremely aggressive.
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:52.502]  And then the $100 billion that the U.S.
[00:30:52.562 --> 00:30:58.225]  has given Israel illegally because you can't give aid to a nuclear-armed country.
[00:30:58.265 --> 00:30:59.366]  That's completely illegal.
[00:30:59.746 --> 00:31:02.348]  How about give me back the $100 billion?
[00:31:02.388 --> 00:31:03.849]  Give America back the $100 billion?
[00:31:04.089 --> 00:31:06.470]  And you can be all the mad dog all day long.
[00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:10.673]  But, you know, give me my money first that you owe me, which I figured out they owe me personally about $2,300.
[00:31:10.793 --> 00:31:15.515]  If I figure out my tax, you know, for the last 25 years.
[00:31:16.796 --> 00:31:20.381]  Uh, give me back my $2,500 and then you can be a mad dog all day.
[00:31:20.862 --> 00:31:23.485]  But don't be doing it in my name with my money.
[00:31:23.505 --> 00:31:24.867]  It's not in my interest.
[00:31:25.287 --> 00:31:27.751]  We've got nothing compatible.
[00:31:27.791 --> 00:31:29.213]  We don't have any interest together.
[00:31:29.373 --> 00:31:32.357]  So just be your mad dog self but not with my money.
[00:31:32.981 --> 00:31:38.985]  Well, I mean, Israel's got 400 high-tech nukes, high-tech cruise missiles, jets, bombers, tanks.
[00:31:39.485 --> 00:31:41.286]  I mean, Israel does not need our help.
[00:31:42.127 --> 00:31:45.589]  And if they want to start World War III, I mean, that's their business.
[00:31:46.509 --> 00:31:48.670]  But there is going to be blowback on this country.
[00:31:48.771 --> 00:31:51.992]  And we know the policy is this nation's going to be involved.
[00:31:52.373 --> 00:31:53.493]  And Israel knows that.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:01.602]  The larger interests, the big banks, the military-industrial complex, they want a new war as a political distraction, Max.
[00:32:01.922 --> 00:32:04.003]  What do you mean there will be blowback?
[00:32:04.043 --> 00:32:05.704]  What do you think 9-11 was all about?
[00:32:05.804 --> 00:32:06.804]  That is blowback!
[00:32:07.645 --> 00:32:14.347]  Well, Max, you know that I... On record, I mean, I believe 9-11 was completely staged.
[00:32:16.024 --> 00:32:34.695]  Well, let me, speaking about 9-11 for a second, you know, and talking about the economics, David Callahan, who is the Executive Editor of a magazine called Smart CEO, he submitted a Freedom of Information Act, this is pretty recent now, to the SEC regarding pre-9-11 put options.
[00:32:35.115 --> 00:32:37.356]  I just picked this up off of Zero Head.
[00:32:37.416 --> 00:32:41.298]  The article is, SEC, Government Destroyed Documents Regarding Pre-9-11 Put Options.
[00:32:43.163 --> 00:32:48.346]  And they came back and they told him that these documents were destroyed.
[00:32:48.726 --> 00:32:52.749]  Not that they lost them, or not that they needed to keep them, but that they were destroyed.
[00:32:53.089 --> 00:33:03.495]  So he's got an article coming out in the August edition of Executive Editor Smart's CEO Magazine about his freedom of information request from the SEC, and they come back to him and say,
[00:33:04.494 --> 00:33:06.335]  These, this information was destroyed.
[00:33:06.755 --> 00:33:19.101]  Now, concurrently, I've got a project on my pirate, my film site, which is called 9-11 Jackpot, and it's being produced and directed by a friend of mine here in Paris.
[00:33:19.855 --> 00:33:29.301]  Who is really digging in to this one piece of the story, the put options that were bought on United Airlines and American Airlines.
[00:33:29.661 --> 00:33:37.886]  Obviously, if you look at this closely, with pre-knowledge of the event, to me this has always been the smoking gun.
[00:33:38.346 --> 00:33:42.589]  And the 9-11 official report gives it very little attention.
[00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:48.314]  Well, it's one smoking gun of literally about a hundred, but it is one of the ones that's really bonafide.
[00:33:48.434 --> 00:34:03.048]  Record put options, not against airlines, but against American and United, specifically leading back, the German papers reported, to Buzzy Krongaard, executive director of the CIA, who was also heading up a big brokerage firm at the time.
[00:34:03.629 --> 00:34:09.460]  Yeah, Alex Brown and Son, which I was working at Alex Brown and Son, and I've met Buzzy Krongaard.
[00:34:10.041 --> 00:34:10.201]  Ah!
[00:34:10.301 --> 00:34:11.183]  Stop the presses!
[00:34:11.944 --> 00:34:13.026]  Let's rewind.
[00:34:13.427 --> 00:34:14.489]  Let's flesh that out.
[00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:15.812]  I didn't know that.
[00:34:15.952 --> 00:34:16.272]  Go ahead.
[00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:34.922]  Yeah, no, I worked at Alex Brown, and I've met Buzzy Krongaard, and down in Baltimore, where Alex Brown had their headquarter, he then took a job over with George Tenet at the CIA, as a deputy director over at the CIA, and the amount of information that flows between the CIA and
[00:34:35.502 --> 00:34:46.955]  Baltimore-based brokerage firm down there in Maryland is enormous, and there's a tremendous amount of chatter between George Senate and the brokers of Alex Brown, where these trades were originated.
[00:34:47.515 --> 00:34:53.202]  The fact that the stock market was closed for several days after the attacks, they didn't anticipate this.
[00:34:53.842 --> 00:35:07.636]  Which is why you had over two million dollar profits were uncollected on these put options because they weren't able to close them out on the same day and journal that money somewhere where it couldn't be found because the markets were closed because they closed the stock exchange.
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:12.863]  But so Buzzy was at Alex Brown, and I know plenty of people at Alex Brown.
[00:35:13.023 --> 00:35:27.872]  And also, I also have another interesting tie to this because my company, the Hollywood Stock Exchange, was bought by Cantor Fitzgerald and moved to the top floor of the World Trade Towers just three months before the attacks.
[00:35:28.413 --> 00:35:34.537]  So I had people who I knew from HSX who were in the towers, and I also knew people at Alex Brown.
[00:35:35.097 --> 00:35:37.858]  So I was privy to a lot of chatter.
[00:35:38.398 --> 00:35:51.623]  And part of what I've been helping this guy explore in his film, 9-11 Jackpot, is to really dig down and look at these puts and to look at what I call the mystery of broker zero.
[00:35:52.183 --> 00:35:59.666]  And this is the mystery of what I have a very strong feeling that I'm going to explore in this film about
[00:36:00.885 --> 00:36:14.993]  A broker that was actually speculating on their own demise, basically buying these puts on these airline stocks unknowingly, unknowing that they were actually speculating on their own demise.
[00:36:15.394 --> 00:36:21.137]  I think this is a fantastic story because it epitomizes the entire American business model today.
[00:36:21.597 --> 00:36:22.678]  Suicide bankers,
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:33.765]  uh... banking jihadis destroying the economy for a quick buck for a failed ideology and they're just actually just throwing the entire economy under the bus.
[00:36:36.446 --> 00:36:37.587]  Well said Max Keiser.
[00:36:37.627 --> 00:36:46.391]  Now I want to go to telephone calls for you on a host of issues but first I had read the cyber security bill
[00:36:47.782 --> 00:36:48.742]  It was all over the news.
[00:36:48.762 --> 00:36:50.803]  Headline, Obama to have kill switch.
[00:36:51.923 --> 00:36:54.003]  And Lieberman came out on CNN yesterday.
[00:36:54.023 --> 00:36:56.944]  We're going to play that clip coming up early in the next hour.
[00:36:58.084 --> 00:37:01.044]  The video, folks want to watch it in its entirety, is in the article.
[00:37:01.604 --> 00:37:04.525]  Lieberman, China can shut down the Internet.
[00:37:04.865 --> 00:37:05.765]  Why can't we?
[00:37:06.505 --> 00:37:07.325]  And that's a quote in there.
[00:37:07.365 --> 00:37:09.046]  He said, well, China can shut down the Internet.
[00:37:09.686 --> 00:37:10.386]  Why can't we?
[00:37:10.446 --> 00:37:11.566]  It's for our own security.
[00:37:12.306 --> 00:37:15.527]  The Financial Times of London, FCC and move to regulate Internet.
[00:37:16.622 --> 00:37:31.391]  uh... says that they're gonna have a bull by box at all the i s p's but also in your home that your tv and your internet is wired through they will both surveil what you're watching and doing this is all openly you know had been blamed you
[00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:55.985]  in a three to two vote along party lines it passed and that the box will also block what you're allowed to see and that they're going to quote tax the alternative media for a quote government megaphone to fund new government propaganda that will be bought and purchased on mainstream television so the government taking over the mainstream dominant media
[00:37:56.966 --> 00:38:00.048]  Shutting down the alternative media and taxing what's left.
[00:38:00.508 --> 00:38:03.090]  I mean, I can't even believe how bold this is.
[00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:06.292]  This is light years ahead of what Communist China does.
[00:38:06.652 --> 00:38:12.315]  They just have ISP firewalls and keyword and web address blockers.
[00:38:12.635 --> 00:38:16.677]  This is going to have that with the NSA controlling all ISPs.
[00:38:18.539 --> 00:38:24.062]  That's only part of it, but then also a black box in your house or business with everything wired through it.
[00:38:24.382 --> 00:38:25.823]  I mean, Max Keiser, this is
[00:38:28.047 --> 00:38:30.669]  I can't even believe I'm actually seeing them do this.
[00:38:30.709 --> 00:38:31.870]  I mean, this is shocking me.
[00:38:33.492 --> 00:38:51.046]  Okay, well, clearly the ability to survey at this level is coming online because the technology associated with it is following what's called the asymptotic curve, which is the curve toward zero cost.
[00:38:51.647 --> 00:38:57.931]  All of the technology involved is getting cheaper every single month for storage, processing, and broadband.
[00:38:58.771 --> 00:39:06.896]  Now, the question is, everyone's going to be surveyed, and everyone is going to have their life completely known by the Fed.
[00:39:07.256 --> 00:39:10.898]  So, how are you going to incentivize these people to actually do some work?
[00:39:11.719 --> 00:39:14.662]  Uh, when they've basically been, their lives have been shattered.
[00:39:15.042 --> 00:39:20.727]  And this is where I think you're going to find a trend toward more and more legalized gambling.
[00:39:21.467 --> 00:39:27.753]  And in the States, this past week, now they're talking about legalizing online gambling in a big, big way.
[00:39:28.313 --> 00:39:32.897]  So you've got, this is, as you can tell, I'm leading up to my theme here of a casino gulag.
[00:39:33.584 --> 00:39:48.408]  So you've got people who are stuck in their homes in front of their computers being watched 24-7 but tolerated because they're able to gamble freely on the internet in the hopes that someday they'll hit the lucky number and they'll escape prison.
[00:39:48.869 --> 00:39:50.369]  And millions and millions of people will...
[00:39:50.489 --> 00:39:51.229]  Oh, that's right!
[00:39:51.329 --> 00:39:59.133]  You said here two years ago that we were going to have debtor prisons again when we first started interviewing you, and now the headlines are all over the U.S.
[00:39:59.213 --> 00:39:59.553]  news.
[00:40:00.054 --> 00:40:01.434]  In prison for debt, $300.
[00:40:01.974 --> 00:40:02.915]  Two months in jail, $365.
[00:40:03.675 --> 00:40:03.715]  Or $366.
[00:40:03.815 --> 00:40:05.756]  In fact, pull up the actual headline.
[00:40:05.836 --> 00:40:09.478]  Woman loses home for $360-something was the headline over unpaid water bill.
[00:40:09.498 --> 00:40:11.779]  I mean, they are now creating debtor prisons.
[00:40:20.695 --> 00:40:21.555]  I'm glad you brought that up.
[00:40:21.715 --> 00:40:24.936]  I did bring it up on your show originally, and it's from thestartribune.com.
[00:40:25.036 --> 00:40:26.257]  In jail for being in debt.
[00:40:27.137 --> 00:40:28.658]  And this is becoming a huge trend.
[00:40:29.438 --> 00:40:33.979]  People are finding themselves thrown in jail for having $200 or $300 in debt.
[00:40:34.499 --> 00:40:40.121]  And you have debt peonage and serfs, basically, as you go into this casino gulag model.
[00:40:40.461 --> 00:40:48.404]  And you throw people in the gulag, and you put them in front of a computer screen, and you give them credits to gamble with.
[00:40:49.179 --> 00:40:56.462]  And as long as they keep feeding the machine, which in this case is to just keep turning over these credits.
[00:40:56.522 --> 00:40:57.482]  Well, that's what they say.
[00:40:57.542 --> 00:41:10.287]  They say that of the new debtor prisons that you're going to do customer service, internet service from a distance, and that now everyone will be working in these private prisons paying off their debts.
[00:41:10.627 --> 00:41:12.228]  That's called forced labor camps.
[00:41:13.619 --> 00:41:14.120]  Absolutely.
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:17.864]  And people are willingly marching into these into these casino gulags.
[00:41:18.344 --> 00:41:21.067]  I've been saying this for a couple years.
[00:41:21.167 --> 00:41:28.495]  I'd like to put my name attached to this concept because it's happening in real time and it's getting more evidence of it every day.
[00:41:28.635 --> 00:41:31.118]  And they've got computers that they admit that they've wargamed.
[00:41:31.158 --> 00:41:32.379]  The headline a few months ago was 93%
[00:41:34.717 --> 00:41:36.418]  Of people that own cell phones.
[00:41:36.438 --> 00:41:41.880]  They have a 93% accuracy rate of knowing where you're physically going to drive or go next.
[00:41:42.301 --> 00:41:48.444]  Just after a few months tracking you by GPS, they know the hidden patterns before you even know it.
[00:41:48.464 --> 00:41:53.206]  And I've seen statistics of 99% accuracy on where you're going to surf next.
[00:41:54.511 --> 00:41:54.871]  After the...
[00:42:12.478 --> 00:42:25.238]  All kinds of tricks to predict your behavior, to put you in front of situations where you're likely to gamble in ways that you can't afford, and to put yourself into debt, and then they've got something for you to do now that you're in debtor's prison.
[00:42:26.182 --> 00:42:33.183]  All that technology comes from the casino industry, which is growing, and they're going to legalize online gambling.
[00:42:33.343 --> 00:42:37.104]  And that is a huge step towards... And we won't have any factories.
[00:42:37.224 --> 00:42:38.444]  We won't have any jobs.
[00:42:38.884 --> 00:42:40.885]  Literally, our daughters will all be hookers.
[00:42:41.485 --> 00:42:42.465]  That's all expanding.
[00:42:42.845 --> 00:42:46.546]  Men will work in casinos and then spend their earnings in the casinos.
[00:42:46.626 --> 00:42:55.167]  And when they get totally bankrupt, they go into the slave labor camp to then work for 25 cents an hour, displacing more of the real economy, or they'll be cop enforcers.
[00:42:55.407 --> 00:42:56.107]  Here's a question.
[00:42:56.388 --> 00:43:02.331]  If you have a septic system, did you know that proper maintenance can save you thousands of dollars in costly and unnecessary repairs?

[00:44:00.935 --> 00:44:04.479]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:44:04.499 --> 00:44:07.101]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:44:07.121 --> 00:44:12.566]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:44:12.986 --> 00:44:19.192]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:44:19.631 --> 00:44:25.175]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:44:25.595 --> 00:44:29.278]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:44:29.798 --> 00:44:33.821]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:44:34.081 --> 00:44:39.645]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:44:40.046 --> 00:44:42.928]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:44:43.568 --> 00:44:44.990]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:46.030]  It's here.

[00:44:55.399 --> 00:44:58.602]  So you think the massive Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[00:44:59.142 --> 00:44:59.643]  Think again.
[00:45:00.453 --> 00:45:07.938]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen, is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[00:45:08.098 --> 00:45:15.083]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[00:45:15.343 --> 00:45:23.589]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers on how to clean the air on boats aiding in the Gulf cleanup.

[00:46:00.011 --> 00:46:00.853]  I don't know.
[00:46:10.094 --> 00:46:12.276]  Alright, we're going to your calls with Max Keiser.
[00:46:12.296 --> 00:46:20.125]  We're going to talk about the WikiLeaks situation, and the parliament voting in Iceland to make it an internet free zone for the free press.
[00:46:20.705 --> 00:46:23.508]  Maybe the only place in the world where you've got freedom on the internet.
[00:46:23.708 --> 00:46:28.333]  Problem is, then the globalists will simply block internet communication out of the country.
[00:46:29.174 --> 00:46:32.397]  But then anything you try to keep people from getting, they go after.
[00:46:33.371 --> 00:46:43.302]  And so, one way or another, the genie's out of the bottle, the horse already left the barn, the cat's out of the bag, that train already left the station, you know, all those clichés.
[00:46:43.762 --> 00:46:47.546]  I don't see the system being able to clamp down on it, but if you want to read the article, it's amazing.
[00:46:47.566 --> 00:46:49.388]  I'm going to play the video coming up in the next hour.
[00:46:49.789 --> 00:46:50.249]  Lieberman...
[00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:53.273]  Says China can shut down the internet, why can't we?
[00:46:53.313 --> 00:46:57.638]  And that article is up at GCNLive.com.
[00:46:58.158 --> 00:47:03.665]  Another article up there, criminal investigation of BP, staged oil spill, vital to Gulf recovery.
[00:47:04.005 --> 00:47:05.807]  Also up at GCNLive.com.
[00:47:07.509 --> 00:47:13.073]  A golden response to economic decline from Bob Chapman up on GCNLive.com.
[00:47:13.774 --> 00:47:14.294]  Here's another one.
[00:47:14.314 --> 00:47:18.117]  States need to launch criminal investigation to BP, federal government's role in the oil spill.
[00:47:18.418 --> 00:47:21.220]  Paul Joseph Watson, GCNLive.com.
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:25.403]  Carbon tax on electricity to send prices skyrocketing.
[00:47:25.423 --> 00:47:26.924]  That's up on GCNLive.com.
[00:47:27.265 --> 00:47:29.006]  Oh, and by the way, I forgot to get to this.
[00:47:30.087 --> 00:47:31.228]  It's in my stack here.
[00:47:32.769 --> 00:47:34.631]  The European Union has announced
[00:47:35.854 --> 00:47:36.935]  Where is that in my stack?
[00:47:36.975 --> 00:47:38.377]  I can't keep track of anything anymore.
[00:47:39.458 --> 00:47:43.081]  They have announced that there'll be a ban on private family dwellings.
[00:47:43.301 --> 00:47:46.024]  You've got to live in big compact government buildings.
[00:47:46.444 --> 00:47:47.805]  The family is to be erased.
[00:47:48.126 --> 00:47:50.448]  The human species is to fully be removed.
[00:47:50.768 --> 00:47:52.730]  This is what the carbon taxes mean in the end.
[00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:54.632]  I will cover that in the next hour as well.
[00:47:55.172 --> 00:47:56.113]  Max, did you see that
[00:47:56.954 --> 00:48:05.421]  That article on the London Telegraph where they're announcing in the Euro that you're not going to be allowed to have your own home.
[00:48:05.721 --> 00:48:07.302]  You must live in government communes.
[00:48:07.362 --> 00:48:07.943]  How does that sound?
[00:48:09.324 --> 00:48:16.870]  It sounds like massive deflation, which is wracking the global economy and a trend that will continue for the foreseeable future.
[00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:23.916]  Deflation is really gathering speed and it's a huge economic problem.
[00:48:23.936 --> 00:48:26.238]  The housing market in the US is going to continue to crash.
[00:48:26.998 --> 00:48:34.621]  And, you know, you've got a big second wave of economic downturn which is now underway.
[00:48:35.102 --> 00:48:41.584]  But getting back about Iceland in terms of Europe, I mean, I think Iceland is the most interesting country in the world right now for the reasons that you just mentioned.
[00:48:41.604 --> 00:48:45.166]  They've got this new free zone for freedom of the press.
[00:48:45.926 --> 00:48:49.608]  And, you know, there's a country that got battered by the international banking system.
[00:48:49.848 --> 00:48:53.149]  They loaded them up with 10 times their GDP in debt.
[00:48:53.449 --> 00:48:55.070]  Then they pulled the rug out from underneath them.
[00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:56.391]  The economy crashed.
[00:48:56.431 --> 00:48:57.651]  The corona crashed.
[00:48:58.272 --> 00:48:59.892]  The economy's been decimated.
[00:49:00.373 --> 00:49:02.473]  And they're coming back from it, and they're saying, you know what?
[00:49:02.513 --> 00:49:10.637]  Let's reinvent ourselves, and let's do something that's going to be really positive for the globe, especially in the media space.
[00:49:10.677 --> 00:49:11.057]  That's right.
[00:49:11.157 --> 00:49:19.261]  Human ingenuity, just like the dot-com system, is the only revolution we've had here in the last 20 years, and that's what's keeping our economy somewhat alive.
[00:49:19.621 --> 00:49:32.627]  And that's what the carbon tax and globalism is about, is the bureaucrats won't let you have a new job or a new industry or anything unless they approve of it, or unless they get to deploy the new technology through their control arm.
[00:49:33.683 --> 00:49:36.784]  Well, you know, here's something I want to throw out there.
[00:49:36.884 --> 00:49:42.025]  You know, I mean, it's clear that there are a lot of problems in the U.S.
[00:49:42.205 --> 00:49:43.765]  at the moment.
[00:49:43.785 --> 00:49:56.268]  And the fact is that at some point there will be millions of people that decide to emigrate and leave the United States.
[00:49:56.348 --> 00:49:58.649]  And that's an option that's got to be considered.
[00:49:59.309 --> 00:50:02.630]  And it's an option that people have done throughout history.
[00:50:03.169 --> 00:50:07.653]  And it's a bona fide consideration.
[00:50:07.733 --> 00:50:16.620]  I mean, if the country is simply not going to support the kind of democracy and freedom that you think you deserve, you may have to just leave.
[00:50:18.479 --> 00:50:20.480]  Or we can take our republic back.
[00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:22.701]  Because Max, I don't want a democracy.
[00:50:22.721 --> 00:50:25.882]  I mean, I want a constitutional republic where the minority is protected.
[00:50:25.902 --> 00:50:27.082]  But I know what you mean by democracy.
[00:50:27.102 --> 00:50:28.743]  You mean where the people are in charge.
[00:50:29.163 --> 00:50:31.104]  I want the Bill of Rights and Constitution to be in charge.
[00:50:31.644 --> 00:50:33.945]  Josh, Dan, Rob, Sean, Steve, you're straight ahead.
[00:50:34.045 --> 00:50:34.305]  One minute.
[00:50:35.446 --> 00:50:38.347]  On air, online, and on demand.
[00:50:38.407 --> 00:50:40.988]  They say we offer simple answers to complex problems.
[00:50:41.048 --> 00:50:43.649]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:50:46.704 --> 00:50:50.305]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:50:50.645 --> 00:50:58.766]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:50:59.506 --> 00:51:03.547]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:51:04.127 --> 00:51:14.949]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:24.591]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:51:25.091 --> 00:51:30.132]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:51:30.533 --> 00:51:37.694]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:51:38.014 --> 00:51:40.775]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:51:47.992 --> 00:51:49.934]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:50.394 --> 00:51:53.176]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:52:07.191 --> 00:52:13.617]  International television and radio host Max Keiser is our guest for another 15 minutes.
[00:52:13.637 --> 00:52:27.109]  We're now going directly to your phone calls, and I'm going to news blitz, and then we've got the guys from my team who were up in Chicago for military urban warfare drills, witnessed foreign troops training
[00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:29.351]  To take over American cities.
[00:52:29.391 --> 00:52:33.212]  We have the video, it will premiere here coming up in about 35 minutes.
[00:52:33.752 --> 00:52:36.733]  Dan in Canada, thanks for holding, you're on the air.
[00:52:36.753 --> 00:52:47.398]  Hey Max, do you think the Castro brothers down in Cuba would renew the proposal to move Guantanamo Bay if the oil was to hit their shores?
[00:52:47.618 --> 00:52:48.018]  And thanks.
[00:52:50.419 --> 00:52:50.619]  Huh.
[00:52:51.843 --> 00:53:00.870]  So, in other words, the Gulf Oil, if it hits Cuba, is it going to set up a conflict and whether or not they would renew the lease on Guantanamo Bay?
[00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:01.630]  Is that the question?
[00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:03.812]  Yes, that's the question.
[00:53:04.513 --> 00:53:10.837]  Yeah, well, I don't think that's really the determining factor in renewing it.
[00:53:10.997 --> 00:53:12.719]  Why do they keep it?
[00:53:13.159 --> 00:53:14.280]  Why do they have it there now?
[00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:16.181]  Why don't they throw the U.S.
[00:53:16.301 --> 00:53:16.862]  out right now?
[00:53:18.168 --> 00:53:19.749]  They don't need the Gulf to throw out the U.S.
[00:53:19.909 --> 00:53:23.531]  Well, Eisenhower called Fidel the Abraham Lincoln of the Caribbean.
[00:53:23.591 --> 00:53:24.332]  It's all staged.
[00:53:25.112 --> 00:53:26.613]  But why don't they throw him out right now?
[00:53:26.633 --> 00:53:27.554]  Because it's all staged.
[00:53:29.115 --> 00:53:36.940]  No, okay, but I mean, I don't, what's the, I mean, obviously they're under tremendous threat, I mean, but, I mean, it's...
[00:53:39.261 --> 00:53:43.122]  It's interesting because the ecology around Cuba is pristine.
[00:53:43.162 --> 00:53:50.925]  Yeah, I've seen video of the scuba diving there, and let me tell you, my tongue is hanging out.
[00:53:54.446 --> 00:53:57.047]  For those that don't know what the Niger Delta is, why don't you tell them?
[00:53:59.007 --> 00:54:00.488]  Tell folks what the Niger Delta is.
[00:54:01.001 --> 00:54:04.742]  No, no, I'm saying off the coast of Niger it's a huge ecological disaster.
[00:54:04.762 --> 00:54:05.842]  You've got shell oil there.
[00:54:06.102 --> 00:54:10.844]  You've got flaming oil rigs out in the open.
[00:54:10.884 --> 00:54:16.725]  It's become a cesspool of oil because it's just they've gone in there and they've destroyed the ecology.
[00:54:17.085 --> 00:54:22.927]  The people are under incredible cancerous threat and this is what we're going to find in the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:54:22.947 --> 00:54:27.268]  But they had to go dump the oil or Saddam would have gotten the yellow cake.
[00:54:28.066 --> 00:54:29.668]  They're not going to clean it up in the Gulf.
[00:54:29.688 --> 00:54:30.729]  They're never going to clean it up.
[00:54:30.809 --> 00:54:37.276]  It's just going to become a festering, oozing Gulf of Niger-like ecological calamity that they're never going to clean up.
[00:54:37.296 --> 00:54:43.904]  And you better believe they're going to take the cleanup money and give it to their cronies like Halliburton, who will spend $15 million on a blue tarp.
[00:54:45.145 --> 00:55:02.750]  Well now that they've got some American speaking representative for BP down there, the problem will seem a lot worse because they'll be able to speak in an American accent and say, we're taking care of the problem and there's nothing, we're gonna get it all, instead of that British accent that everyone couldn't stand, now they'll get some good old boy.
[00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:04.510]  Well, it wasn't even a British accent.
[00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:05.731]  I know the guy is British.
[00:55:05.811 --> 00:55:08.931]  I couldn't even, it was like, and we will do without.
[00:55:09.391 --> 00:55:14.352]  I'm out of the yachting right now, and you'll say, believe it, the little people down there.
[00:55:14.732 --> 00:55:17.053]  Well, folks didn't like being called little people, did they, Max?
[00:55:18.193 --> 00:55:21.254]  Well, it tells you the mentality that we're dealing with here.
[00:55:21.394 --> 00:55:27.135]  It's that they have a concept of entitlement that
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:31.342]  They own everything, and we own nothing, and it's in our own backyard.
[00:55:31.362 --> 00:55:32.423]  Alright, let's talk to Rob.
[00:55:32.443 --> 00:55:33.964]  Let's talk to Rob and Tejas.
[00:55:33.984 --> 00:55:34.864]  You're on the air, Rob.
[00:55:37.185 --> 00:55:38.946]  Okay, uh, two comments real quick.
[00:55:39.387 --> 00:55:45.390]  Max, yes or no, do you think there's really gonna be a, uh, an attack here in the next week or so?
[00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:48.852]  Okay, I didn't get the first part of that.
[00:55:49.612 --> 00:55:50.473]  Uh, what are you talking about?
[00:55:50.493 --> 00:55:52.074]  Uh, well, that's my question for Max.
[00:55:52.294 --> 00:55:53.415]  An attack on what?
[00:55:53.575 --> 00:55:54.475]  An attack on what?
[00:55:55.176 --> 00:55:55.556]  Iran.
[00:55:56.958 --> 00:55:59.641]  Oh, well, oh boy, yeah.
[00:55:59.782 --> 00:56:02.265]  It looks like it's heating up.
[00:56:04.027 --> 00:56:04.948]  Well, I want to be clear.
[00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:06.369]  Hold on, we'll hold both of you over.
[00:56:06.429 --> 00:56:08.252]  We have to, because the break's coming up.
[00:56:08.692 --> 00:56:13.498]  But did Max say there's going to be an attack in a week, or do you think you heard me say that?
[00:56:13.518 --> 00:56:14.619]  Because I'm not saying that.
[00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:16.882]  I mean, who said there's going to be an attack in a week?
[00:56:18.444 --> 00:56:20.626]  Well, the ships are in the Gulf right now, so, you know.
[00:56:20.866 --> 00:56:31.436]  Yeah, but they're there to menace right now and then start the blockade, and then if Iran doesn't allow themselves to have all their ships basically pillaged and then fights back, then that'll be the pretext.
[00:56:31.476 --> 00:56:32.277]  Stay there, both of you.
[00:56:32.697 --> 00:56:33.798]  Max Keiser is our guest.
[00:56:33.858 --> 00:56:34.799]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:38.141]  We're now five minutes into the final hour.
[00:56:38.161 --> 00:56:42.823]  We'll finish up with Rob, Sean, George, Steve, and then hit one or two other news items with Max Keiser and let him go.
[00:56:42.843 --> 00:56:44.283]  And then we've got a news blitz.
[00:56:44.623 --> 00:56:50.385]  And then I'm gonna recap what's happening with BP and my call for criminal investigation.
[00:56:50.405 --> 00:56:53.987]  Then we'll talk about foreign troops in America training to take your guns.
[00:56:54.747 --> 00:56:58.989]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:56:59.309 --> 00:56:59.929]  Number one.
[00:57:00.209 --> 00:57:03.370]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:57:03.630 --> 00:57:04.210]  Number two.
[00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:09.052]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:57:09.392 --> 00:57:09.832]  It's true.
[00:57:10.132 --> 00:57:14.694]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:57:14.994 --> 00:57:15.554]  Number three.
[00:57:15.834 --> 00:57:19.116]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:57:19.416 --> 00:57:23.117]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:57:23.317 --> 00:57:23.857]  Number 4.
[00:57:24.118 --> 00:57:26.479]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:30.262]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:57:30.562 --> 00:57:30.762]  Number 5.
[00:57:31.343 --> 00:57:35.265]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:57:35.506 --> 00:57:40.249]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:44.572]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:57:44.712 --> 00:57:46.273]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:57:46.493 --> 00:57:48.574]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:57:48.754 --> 00:57:51.096]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:57:58.715 --> 00:57:59.636]  Tyranny is here.
[00:57:59.977 --> 00:58:03.561]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:58:03.701 --> 00:58:06.124]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:58:06.144 --> 00:58:11.591]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:58:12.011 --> 00:58:18.239]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:58:18.659 --> 00:58:24.222]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:58:24.642 --> 00:58:28.304]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:58:28.824 --> 00:58:32.826]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:58:33.106 --> 00:58:38.629]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:58:39.049 --> 00:58:42.050]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:58:42.611 --> 00:58:44.031]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:58:44.592 --> 00:58:45.032]  It's here.

[00:58:55.011 --> 00:58:57.632]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:58:58.032 --> 00:59:02.994]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:59:03.354 --> 00:59:05.075]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:59:05.395 --> 00:59:10.217]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:59:10.397 --> 00:59:11.358]  How much do you want?
[00:59:11.578 --> 00:59:12.318]  When do you want it?
[00:59:12.718 --> 00:59:14.299]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:59:14.599 --> 00:59:15.419]  When will you need it?
[00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:17.720]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:18.861]  Will there be any food?
[00:59:19.201 --> 00:59:23.106]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[00:59:23.266 --> 00:59:25.789]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:59:25.989 --> 00:59:29.173]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:59:29.593 --> 00:59:33.078]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:59:33.398 --> 00:59:34.399]  How much will you need?
[00:59:34.639 --> 00:59:35.240]  We don't know.
[00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:36.442]  How much do you want?
[00:59:36.642 --> 00:59:37.363]  All you can get.
[00:59:37.383 --> 00:59:38.384]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:59:38.644 --> 00:59:41.407]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:59:41.707 --> 00:59:42.048]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:42.068 --> 00:59:43.449]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:43.469 --> 00:59:44.570]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:44.830]  Life.
[00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:45.211]  Big Brother.
[00:59:45.231 --> 00:59:46.112]  Mainstream Media.
[01:00:03.255 --> 01:00:04.396]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:05.016 --> 01:00:05.837]  You want answers?
[01:00:06.617 --> 01:00:08.078]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:08.138 --> 01:00:11.720]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:16.443]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.821 --> 01:00:34.683]  All right, we're eight minutes into the final hour, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:35.883 --> 01:00:37.484]  Max Keiser is our guest.
[01:00:38.725 --> 01:00:43.287]  Go ahead and finish up your point, Rob, in Texas about the situation with Iran.
[01:00:44.768 --> 01:00:53.213]  Well, that's all I had for Max, because, you know, I was a little worried about, you know, what that could mean for gas prices if, you know, there's an attack on Iran.
[01:00:53.293 --> 01:00:56.535]  But my final thing, I'll wrap up and bounce out of here real quick.
[01:00:57.655 --> 01:00:58.456]  YouTube is
[01:00:59.246 --> 01:01:02.688]  Seemingly messing with my views and keeping my video off the front page.
[01:01:02.748 --> 01:01:10.292]  So if InfoWarriors out there could mobilize and go Google or YouTube search Dennis Miller Show InfoBombed.
[01:01:10.891 --> 01:01:11.851]  And support that video.
[01:01:11.871 --> 01:01:13.572]  Keep it on that front page just for a couple days.
[01:01:13.632 --> 01:01:14.952]  Thank you very much, Alex and Max.
[01:01:15.052 --> 01:01:16.273]  All right, buddy.
[01:01:16.313 --> 01:01:16.693]  Keep it up.
[01:01:16.733 --> 01:01:17.173]  Good job.
[01:01:17.213 --> 01:01:18.293]  Going back to Max Keiser.
[01:01:18.934 --> 01:01:20.414]  We can't talk enough about Iran.
[01:01:20.474 --> 01:01:24.595]  I mean, it does... Israel's saying they may strike them and forget just gas prices.
[01:01:25.115 --> 01:01:26.176]  A lot more could happen.
[01:01:26.196 --> 01:01:29.577]  From your research, what could a strike on Iran turn into, Max?
[01:01:30.397 --> 01:01:31.777]  Well, I mean, yeah, the timing.
[01:01:32.318 --> 01:01:33.438]  I agree with the caller.
[01:01:33.538 --> 01:01:39.820]  If you look at the oil prices for timing, that's usually a good indicator of, you know, how urgent
[01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:50.838]  Where the situation is, oil prices at the moment, the past few days, couple of weeks, are not telegraphing a huge, you know, shock and awe type event.
[01:01:51.498 --> 01:02:03.807]  But clearly, they are trying to collar the country with the same kind of draconian, you know, what do you call it?
[01:02:09.716 --> 01:02:11.357]  In Gaza, you know, the embargo.
[01:02:12.778 --> 01:02:24.525]  And I think those flotillas, actually, that are flowing into Gaza, I think are having a much greater impact on how these events are unfolding than people realize.
[01:02:25.105 --> 01:02:33.189]  Because they are putting on the front page the real human drama of this prison that's being operated by Israel in Gaza.
[01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:35.711]  A million and a half people held in the concentration camp.
[01:02:36.249 --> 01:02:36.689]  Yes, I have.
[01:02:56.782 --> 01:02:58.704]  I'd love it if you could get him on again.
[01:02:58.724 --> 01:03:09.835]  He's been fantastic in exposing all of the underlying hypocrisy and atrocities that have been going on in the region.
[01:03:10.435 --> 01:03:15.760]  Now that's the British Member of Parliament from Scotland for those that don't know who he is.
[01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:17.542]  Let's get George Galloway back on.
[01:03:17.822 --> 01:03:20.464]  Yeah, he testified before Congress in the U.S.
[01:03:20.484 --> 01:03:22.625]  a couple of years ago and absolutely decimated.
[01:03:22.645 --> 01:03:31.410]  That's a fantastic YouTube, George Galloway in Washington, where he just tears apart the inquiry into the Food for Oil inquiry.
[01:03:31.730 --> 01:03:41.535]  And he just absolutely tears people apart in Congress and makes them look... He's a fantastic orator and a very smart guy, and he knows that he reads it extremely well.
[01:03:42.115 --> 01:03:43.776]  But, you know, I just...
[01:03:47.579 --> 01:03:53.730]  At the top of the show when we were talking about the Wall Street Journal's idea where oil spills somehow increase GDP.
[01:03:53.770 --> 01:03:56.114]  I mean, this is the mindset that we're dealing with.
[01:03:56.355 --> 01:03:57.236]  Somehow an attack.
[01:03:57.964 --> 01:04:04.028]  In the Middle East, another war in the Middle East is somehow going to improve the economy in the U.S.
[01:04:04.308 --> 01:04:05.790]  It's absolute insanity.
[01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:21.400]  There's no way at this point, given the debt load that the country is carrying, that starting another war or being a part to another war is going to do anything but just speed up this calamitous dive into economic catastrophe.
[01:04:25.216 --> 01:04:29.778]  Well, that's what the big central banks want, and I hope people tuning in realize this is not hyperbole.
[01:04:29.798 --> 01:04:30.758]  We're not hyping this.
[01:04:31.479 --> 01:04:33.480]  Israel's saying they may nuke Iran.
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:34.420]  U.S.
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:36.501]  and Israeli flotillas are now in place.
[01:04:38.122 --> 01:04:40.323]  The BP disaster is going on unabated.
[01:04:40.663 --> 01:04:42.243]  They're trying to pass carbon taxes.
[01:04:42.303 --> 01:04:43.964]  States are going bankrupt left and right.
[01:04:44.324 --> 01:04:46.885]  They're overturning the entire Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:04:47.306 --> 01:04:54.629]  Obama signed an executive order mandating lifestyle behavior modification, with the federal government running every facet of our lives.
[01:04:55.229 --> 01:04:58.490]  EU to ban construction of ordinary family homes by 2020.
[01:04:58.851 --> 01:05:00.851]  You must live in government dormitories.
[01:05:01.211 --> 01:05:02.352]  This is the Borg.
[01:05:03.092 --> 01:05:14.397]  I mean, when I told people years ago that it's gonna be a Chinese model where we're all raised in dormitories and our kids are taken at birth like you take, you know, eggs from a chicken, as George Orwell said, I mean, this is the plan.
[01:05:15.037 --> 01:05:19.438]  They want to totally re-engineer humanity, so it's impossible for us to ever resist.
[01:05:19.818 --> 01:05:25.520]  This is the scientific elite playing God, and they're using economic warfare to bankrupt us and take control.
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:27.760]  Sean in Texas, you're on the air with Max Keiser.
[01:05:28.381 --> 01:05:28.701]  Yes, sir.
[01:05:29.581 --> 01:05:33.442]  I'm glad to be on your show, Alex, and Mr. Keiser, good to meet you.
[01:05:35.062 --> 01:05:40.784]  I live right next door to the largest military installation in the world, which is Fort Hood, Texas.
[01:05:41.736 --> 01:05:46.159]  And I'd like to tell the American people that what's fixing to happen is for real.
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:51.143]  My family was born and raised out there in army camp before it was the camp.
[01:05:51.824 --> 01:05:55.246]  And back in the 40s, the military went out there and moved them off their land.
[01:05:56.087 --> 01:05:58.229]  And basically told them they had to leave.
[01:05:58.329 --> 01:06:01.311]  If they didn't leave, they was going to be imprisoned.
[01:06:02.092 --> 01:06:06.895]  And we can only visit our relatives' graves out in that camp on Memorial Day.
[01:06:07.075 --> 01:06:10.298]  And artillery shells hit out there in the cemetery and everything else.
[01:06:12.533 --> 01:06:18.438]  In this little small town I live in, I'd like to say that the military is gradually taking over.
[01:06:19.119 --> 01:06:24.123]  It's coming into our community, it's coming into our Chamber of Commerce, our city.
[01:06:24.564 --> 01:06:29.067]  I'm the fire chaplain here in our town, and I'm in the Volunteer Fire Department.
[01:06:29.628 --> 01:06:36.354]  And we also, in our fire department, had to be FEMA compliant with Emergency Management Institute.
[01:06:37.074 --> 01:06:38.435]  And from my understanding,
[01:06:39.571 --> 01:06:43.834]  You know, that's countrywide that we have to do.
[01:07:11.633 --> 01:07:16.517]  It's the trend is obviously getting worse.
[01:07:17.078 --> 01:07:23.023]  And but again, my my point is that there seems to be the idea
[01:07:24.514 --> 01:07:30.378]  That somehow this contributes toward a positive economic development.
[01:07:30.458 --> 01:07:40.005]  Like, for example, that corporation I think is a classic example of this, the Corrections Corps of America, CCA, Trades on the New York Stock Exchange, the private prison.
[01:07:40.965 --> 01:07:45.707]  And they also own all the restaurants and all the hotels near the prison.
[01:07:46.007 --> 01:07:51.268]  So when people go to visit their relatives in prison, they stay in the hotels, they eat in the restaurants, and it's a prison complex.
[01:07:51.328 --> 01:07:53.429]  It's a prison industrial complex.
[01:07:53.729 --> 01:07:56.250]  So they're taking tyranny, they're taking
[01:07:56.974 --> 01:08:01.536]  And they're taking it public, so you can publicly trade it on the exchange.
[01:08:01.556 --> 01:08:07.719]  You can buy Prison Corps of America, you can buy Visa and MasterCard, they're basically in the debt slavery business.
[01:08:08.059 --> 01:08:12.340]  You can buy JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, they're in the usury business.
[01:08:12.701 --> 01:08:17.263]  So you can buy and sell tyranny on the New York Stock Exchange every day.
[01:08:17.683 --> 01:08:19.203]  And that's what you can buy and sell.
[01:08:19.564 --> 01:08:25.266]  And people are involved in their pension accounts and their retirement accounts, and they are supporting
[01:08:28.409 --> 01:08:36.371]  Sean, anything else from Texas?
[01:08:37.432 --> 01:08:41.273]  I'd just like to say, you keep the fight up, brother, and don't stop.
[01:08:42.613 --> 01:08:51.416]  Back in the 17th century, when George Washington was our founding father here, you know, he didn't quit neither against the British.
[01:08:52.165 --> 01:08:54.286]  And we have to have some patriots stand up.
[01:08:54.646 --> 01:08:57.927]  Well, I haven't done one one-hundredth of what George Washington did.
[01:08:57.967 --> 01:09:00.848]  That became physical and I don't compare myself to that.
[01:09:01.328 --> 01:09:06.030]  I'm here to wake up the George Washingtons that are out there but don't know it yet.
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:13.549]  And that's my job, and that's what I've always seen my mission is, to get the word out to the people.
[01:09:13.729 --> 01:09:14.490]  Some will listen.
[01:09:14.530 --> 01:09:16.052]  Some will have the calling for liberty.
[01:09:16.553 --> 01:09:18.476]  Others have the spirit of liberty beating in their hearts.
[01:09:18.576 --> 01:09:19.096]  Some don't.
[01:09:19.597 --> 01:09:24.283]  And so I'm here warning people, telling people what's really happening, and then
[01:09:27.335 --> 01:09:27.475]  Hi Max.
[01:09:27.495 --> 01:09:29.196]  I just was reminded of something we were talking about.
[01:09:50.751 --> 01:09:51.111]  I think so.
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:22.030]  And then they'll basically become a force of calling their congressmen, calling, boycotting certain companies who are doing this, make other people more aware of this stuff, demonstrate if necessary, on and on it goes.
[01:10:23.391 --> 01:10:24.652]  You know, something like that.
[01:10:24.692 --> 01:10:37.761]  But the other thing, Alex, I also wanted you to maybe put up those things you need that you don't have the capability for manpower or money that up on some sort of blog that we can reference regularly, and maybe we can set up groups
[01:10:38.419 --> 01:10:41.080]  An organization that can do that for you off-site?
[01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:43.521]  Well, look, I mean, I don't even need to direct everybody.
[01:10:43.641 --> 01:10:48.903]  I mean, people want to co-confront BP, who's outside their jurisdiction, telling media they can't be on the beach?
[01:10:49.483 --> 01:10:54.405]  What if 10,000 Americans, instead of this big Democrat calling for 100,000 people to go be violent?
[01:10:54.626 --> 01:10:56.046]  That's exactly what we don't want.
[01:10:56.306 --> 01:10:57.647]  Sounds like provocateur to me.
[01:10:57.947 --> 01:11:00.188]  Paul Craig Roberts wrote about it and exposed it last week.
[01:11:00.988 --> 01:11:06.729]  What if 10,000 people went with video cameras and had live links to Justin.TV?
[01:11:06.749 --> 01:11:11.971]  They have an Apple iPhone app, where even if they take your phone or camera, it's uploading live.
[01:11:12.191 --> 01:11:18.412]  What if 10,000 people randomly picked different towns on the beach to go out there and confront these goons peacefully?
[01:11:18.852 --> 01:11:21.113]  That would, in the info war, expose them.
[01:11:23.053 --> 01:11:24.454]  I'm thinking about going to the Gulf.
[01:11:24.494 --> 01:11:26.114]  It's going to be going on for a long time, folks.
[01:11:26.474 --> 01:11:28.174]  I'm really worried about Iran right now.
[01:11:28.555 --> 01:11:29.935]  I'm worried about a lot of other issues.
[01:11:31.158 --> 01:11:35.502]  I feel like I can do more here, having guests on and things, but everybody, go there.
[01:11:35.662 --> 01:11:38.545]  And it won't be one magic video that exposes the Gulf.
[01:11:38.945 --> 01:11:40.747]  It'll be thousands of videos together.
[01:11:41.107 --> 01:11:47.953]  Max Keiser, great job, always wonderful to have you on your maiden voyage of a Genesis Radio broadcast, 9 a.m.
[01:11:48.313 --> 01:11:49.515]  Saturday here on Genesis.
[01:11:49.795 --> 01:11:50.515]  God bless you, buddy.
[01:11:50.535 --> 01:11:52.157]  Good to hear from you.
[01:11:53.178 --> 01:11:54.599]  I will be back with a bunch of news.
[01:11:54.639 --> 01:11:55.160]  Your calls.
[01:11:56.109 --> 01:11:58.712]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:11:59.133 --> 01:12:04.099]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:06.202]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:12:06.522 --> 01:12:10.367]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your
[01:12:12.008 --> 01:12:12.088]  Yeah.
[01:12:31.101 --> 01:12:31.421]  We're good!
[01:12:59.881 --> 01:13:00.842]  Tyranny is here.
[01:13:01.143 --> 01:13:04.807]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:13:04.827 --> 01:13:07.289]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:13:07.309 --> 01:13:12.755]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:13:13.175 --> 01:13:19.402]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:13:19.822 --> 01:13:25.385]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:13:25.785 --> 01:13:29.467]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:13:29.987 --> 01:13:33.989]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:13:34.269 --> 01:13:39.811]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:13:40.211 --> 01:13:43.113]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:13:43.773 --> 01:13:45.174]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:13:45.734 --> 01:13:46.235]  It's here.

[01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:57.602]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[01:13:57.842 --> 01:14:01.804]  Are we going to see economic growth, slide into a recession, or at worst, depression?
[01:14:02.004 --> 01:14:04.066]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:14:04.266 --> 01:14:09.289]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[01:14:09.429 --> 01:14:11.190]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[01:14:11.250 --> 01:14:12.571]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[01:14:12.771 --> 01:14:14.232]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[01:14:14.272 --> 01:14:17.353]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[01:14:17.633 --> 01:14:22.675]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:14:23.015 --> 01:14:32.099]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled Ten Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[01:14:32.339 --> 01:14:32.859]  We're good to go.
[01:14:55.106 --> 01:14:56.447]  Don't answer it!
[01:14:56.967 --> 01:15:05.051]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.

[01:15:12.895 --> 01:15:16.956]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?
[01:15:17.156 --> 01:15:24.417]  Zero Debt in 90 Days gets you out of debt in 90 days, guaranteed, without a payment plan, and without attorneys or going to court.

[01:15:47.471 --> 01:15:47.591]  800-477-9256.
[01:15:47.631 --> 01:15:47.812]  That's 800-477-9256.
[01:16:31.706 --> 01:16:38.588]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:38.608 --> 01:16:40.008]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[01:16:40.829 --> 01:16:41.369]  to 3 p.m.
[01:16:41.429 --> 01:16:44.850]  Central Standard Time, or Central Time, depending on the time of the year.
[01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:48.011]  12 noon to 4 p.m.
[01:16:48.071 --> 01:16:48.411]  Eastern.
[01:16:49.704 --> 01:16:53.646]  We're going to have in studio Rob Dew and Jason Douglas.
[01:16:53.886 --> 01:16:56.647]  I didn't send them to the Gulf because we know what's going on in the Gulf.
[01:16:56.707 --> 01:16:57.088]  Tyranny.
[01:16:58.568 --> 01:17:05.352]  To Urban Warfare Drills all over Chicago and I'm glad I sent them because they discovered a lot of really key information.
[01:17:05.372 --> 01:17:13.336]  They're going to be joining us in premiering video and audio here coming up in the next segment in studio with us.
[01:17:14.336 --> 01:17:15.417]  This story is in
[01:17:18.766 --> 01:17:26.412]  A whole bunch of mainstream publications in Europe, but the reference frame website boiled it all down.
[01:17:26.892 --> 01:17:30.155]  EU to ban construction of ordinary family homes by 2020.
[01:17:31.336 --> 01:17:34.598]  Control of every facet of everyone's life.
[01:17:34.798 --> 01:17:36.219]  That is the game plan.
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:42.624]  The European Union has adopted a regulation that will ban the construction of ordinary family homes starting from 2020.
[01:17:44.105 --> 01:17:46.928]  Only the so-called passive homes will be allowed.
[01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:55.462]  For example, on page 33 of 71 of the PDF document above, it says that all new buildings have to be nearly zero energy buildings.
[01:17:55.542 --> 01:17:57.724]  See, like Bill Gates said, zero energy.
[01:17:58.185 --> 01:17:58.945]  This is total tyranny.
[01:17:58.965 --> 01:17:59.926]  You're not allowed to have energy.
[01:18:00.186 --> 01:18:00.987]  That's siege.
[01:18:01.247 --> 01:18:03.629]  This is high-tech siege by the end of 2020.
[01:18:04.090 --> 01:18:09.934]  It has to be true by the end of 2018 for all new buildings occupied by public authorities.
[01:18:10.335 --> 01:18:13.958]  So that's how they fund the industry of this, is government adopts it first.
[01:18:16.235 --> 01:18:21.656]  One of the first passive houses in Darmstadt, Germany, and I've heard about this house on NPR.
[01:18:21.876 --> 01:18:23.317]  They promote it as it's real cool.
[01:18:24.037 --> 01:18:27.357]  The windows are bleak to go to the south.
[01:18:27.898 --> 01:18:31.298]  Also, it is not a coincidence that the house is ugly.
[01:18:31.418 --> 01:18:34.279]  Ugly and compact houses are more energy efficient.
[01:18:35.579 --> 01:18:37.039]  Everything must look the same, too.
[01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:42.201]  The government decides what's on TV, what's on radio, what your house looks like, how many kids you can have.
[01:18:42.561 --> 01:18:43.721]  Government is God!
[01:18:45.074 --> 01:18:53.482]  A passive house is essentially an ugly cube that covers its energy needs by a perpetual motion machine or something that has the same carbon footprint.
[01:18:53.542 --> 01:19:01.850]  Also, it's super perfectly isolated so that the CO2 you exhale by breathing will get out of the house.
[01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:07.055]  The EU apparatchniks see another advantage in this passive house.
[01:19:07.255 --> 01:19:07.755]  If you
[01:19:09.605 --> 01:19:16.306]  I mean it just goes on and on and of course they'll have to be big houses with a bunch of people living in it because that uses less material.
[01:19:17.870 --> 01:19:23.652]  At this moment, there exist 15,000 of passive homes in the world, mostly in Germany, Australia, and Scandinavia.
[01:19:23.952 --> 01:19:24.993]  And Germany's a model.
[01:19:25.093 --> 01:19:26.653]  Germany has, what, 1.2 kids?
[01:19:27.033 --> 01:19:27.974]  So Germany's dying.
[01:19:28.014 --> 01:19:29.694]  For every two adults, they replace themselves 1.2.
[01:19:30.935 --> 01:19:32.855]  Many German cities are basically half empty.
[01:19:33.255 --> 01:19:35.256]  And it's like, oh, let's stop having even more kids.
[01:19:35.296 --> 01:19:36.577]  Let's not build houses.
[01:19:36.857 --> 01:19:37.977]  Let's be total slaves.
[01:19:38.017 --> 01:19:39.378]  Let's banker bailout.
[01:19:39.698 --> 01:19:41.098]  Everything must go to Goldman Sachs.
[01:19:41.138 --> 01:19:41.878]  Good job, Germany.
[01:19:41.918 --> 01:19:42.499]  Killing yourself.
[01:19:43.759 --> 01:19:45.300]  Japanese passive houses.
[01:19:47.199 --> 01:19:53.560]  People would realize that the ordinary houses will become scarce, a limited commodity, and their price will jump at least by 10 to 15 percent.
[01:19:54.020 --> 01:20:05.923]  Correspondingly, the construction of the classical houses will increase before 2020 because the developers will be able to sell a higher number of houses in a profitable way because the price that the buyers will be ready to pay will increase too.
[01:20:06.203 --> 01:20:12.644]  Yeah, but you'll be able to get a special government allowance if you pay kickbacks, though, to have a regular house or to be able to have your own home.
[01:20:13.304 --> 01:20:15.325]  Oh, you don't get to live in a house by yourself.
[01:20:15.405 --> 01:20:16.665]  It's an apartment building.
[01:20:17.765 --> 01:20:23.009]  However, don't expect that the existing owners will be completely protected against the new insane politics.
[01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:31.617]  If they want to sell or rent their house or apartment starting in 2012, they will have to get in a document about the energy efficiency of the real estate, something that costs $500 or so.
[01:20:31.897 --> 01:20:33.898]  And see, here in the U.S., they're priming you for this.
[01:20:34.199 --> 01:20:38.062]  You go to buy a washer or dryer and they say, hey, we got a $150 coupon.
[01:20:38.082 --> 01:20:39.523]  You give the city of Austin.
[01:20:40.404 --> 01:20:42.405]  My dad went and bought a new washer and dryer this weekend.
[01:20:43.508 --> 01:20:46.830]  And he said, oh, $150 coupon here at Home Depot with the city of Austin.
[01:20:47.171 --> 01:20:47.971]  It's real nice.
[01:20:48.011 --> 01:20:50.993]  You get a home inspection and an energy audit.
[01:20:51.253 --> 01:20:53.274]  Well, in a couple of years, those become mandatory.
[01:20:53.735 --> 01:21:00.539]  And in the Senate bill that's passed the House, in one week, if you don't make the changes they want, your home is forfeited.
[01:21:00.599 --> 01:21:01.520]  No court, no nothing.
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:06.943]  So they're just training you about how cool and how fun all of this is.
[01:21:07.303 --> 01:21:10.526]  So that is just total control.
[01:21:11.448 --> 01:21:14.829]  This is the Enviro-Cult that has nothing to do with the environment.
[01:21:14.849 --> 01:21:17.610]  Are they worried about genetic engineering, cross-species engineering?
[01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:19.971]  Are they worried about things that actually could damage the Earth?
[01:21:20.291 --> 01:21:22.391]  Nuclear weapons, fish infusion?
[01:21:22.411 --> 01:21:25.432]  Are they worried about the Hadron Superconducting Super Collider?
[01:21:25.692 --> 01:21:29.453]  Are they worried about all these super technologies that do endanger the Earth?
[01:21:29.573 --> 01:21:29.774]  No.
[01:21:30.214 --> 01:21:35.715]  They're teaching you that carbon, that all animals exhale, is a toxic waste to make you the enemy.
[01:21:36.095 --> 01:21:38.376]  And government then can come in and take control of your life.
[01:21:39.196 --> 01:21:40.517]  In Studio, coming up.
[01:21:41.377 --> 01:21:45.498]  Troops training with foreign troops and police to take on the American people.
[01:21:45.598 --> 01:21:46.518]  We're on the march.
[01:21:46.998 --> 01:21:48.599]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:49.539 --> 01:21:52.280]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:56.101 --> 01:22:01.802]  The fall of America and the Western world was an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[01:22:02.549 --> 01:22:06.994]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing, and what you can do to prepare.

[01:23:54.406 --> 01:23:56.728]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:23:56.788 --> 01:23:59.009]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:23:59.109 --> 01:24:01.891]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:24:02.331 --> 01:24:07.074]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:24:07.434 --> 01:24:11.617]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:24:11.937 --> 01:24:14.261]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:24:14.281 --> 01:24:16.824]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:24:17.165 --> 01:24:19.729]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:24:20.089 --> 01:24:27.701]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:24:28.024 --> 01:24:33.269]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:24:33.409 --> 01:24:35.692]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:24:35.732 --> 01:24:39.695]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:24:39.956 --> 01:24:40.877]  And I got news for you.
[01:24:41.017 --> 01:24:42.338]  You're everyone else.
[01:24:42.358 --> 01:24:43.379]  Invisible Empire.

[01:25:42.372 --> 01:26:01.829]  All right ladies and gentlemen the guys came up here and worked some on the weekend they have more than 20 hours of footage and they're boiling they boiled it down they're trying to transfer it over to the computer system right now so we can premiere it here and that's the easiest way to do it live to actually get it up on presentplanet.tv but it will be
[01:26:02.329 --> 01:26:07.412]  Be up on PrisonPlanet.tv this evening regardless, and we may have it for you by the end of the show.
[01:26:07.692 --> 01:26:12.455]  But you also have the documents given out by the state police, by the National Guard.
[01:26:13.155 --> 01:26:16.857]  So we've got Jason Douglas and Rob Dew, two gammer guys.
[01:26:16.877 --> 01:26:22.140]  They also helped direct and edit the film Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, my latest documentary.
[01:26:22.981 --> 01:26:28.244]  Guys, go over arriving, what you saw, what you witnessed, and people need to understand
[01:26:28.744 --> 01:26:30.185]  I've been to these urban warfare drills.
[01:26:30.205 --> 01:26:31.186]  This is not isolated.
[01:26:31.666 --> 01:26:39.091]  And they're acclimating the public for military occupation, for schools to be taken over by troops, military, regular army, foreign troops.
[01:26:39.571 --> 01:26:44.415]  And I have witnessed, in Hebron, Maryland, troops training for gun confiscation, the Marines.
[01:26:44.875 --> 01:26:46.856]  We've witnessed it in Swansboro, North Carolina.
[01:26:47.216 --> 01:26:49.178]  We've witnessed it in Alabama, Urban Warrior.
[01:26:49.218 --> 01:26:50.779]  In California, foreign troops.
[01:26:51.099 --> 01:26:54.541]  With our troops, training with role players who are American terrorists.
[01:26:54.902 --> 01:26:56.222]  In LE09 last year.
[01:26:56.242 --> 01:26:57.363]  So this is not isolated.
[01:26:58.604 --> 01:26:59.465]  Kentucky Derby.
[01:27:01.105 --> 01:27:03.747]  You know, somebody runs out on the field after the race.
[01:27:04.027 --> 01:27:05.908]  The troops run up with 45s and arrest them.
[01:27:06.288 --> 01:27:07.549]  They didn't have police do it.
[01:27:07.929 --> 01:27:08.830]  No, troops did it.
[01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:10.591]  Year after year.
[01:27:10.651 --> 01:27:11.471]  The Super Bowl.
[01:27:12.051 --> 01:27:14.813]  Marines running drunk driving checkpoints all over the country.
[01:27:14.993 --> 01:27:16.634]  Well, what's wrong with the Marines stopping drunks?
[01:27:17.074 --> 01:27:25.479]  We are being acclimated for military occupation and now they admit Brigade Homeland and Homeland Security and NORTHCOM and the military is trying to take on their number one threat.
[01:27:25.979 --> 01:27:34.786]  The former military, gun owners, New York Times about Boy Scouts training to take on disgruntled vets that own guns, and we cover that in Police State 4.
[01:27:35.046 --> 01:27:36.868]  You guys did a great job working on that.
[01:27:37.508 --> 01:27:38.429]  I sent you to this.
[01:27:38.489 --> 01:27:39.630]  We were not disappointed.
[01:27:40.531 --> 01:27:42.272]  I wish we would have been disappointed.
[01:27:42.312 --> 01:27:45.055]  I wish it would have just been a normal terror drill, but no, it wasn't.
[01:27:45.075 --> 01:27:47.557]  It was a federalization martial law drill.
[01:27:47.577 --> 01:27:52.801]  So, gentlemen, great job up in Chicago and surrounding areas in your five-day trip.
[01:27:53.982 --> 01:27:55.143]  Break down what you witnessed.
[01:27:55.981 --> 01:28:04.086]  All right, well, we arrived on Saturday and we scattered out some of the locations that they were putting out in their press releases of where these events were going to be taking place.
[01:28:04.126 --> 01:28:07.969]  And we had a hotel pretty close to the first one, which is in Oak Lawn.
[01:28:08.029 --> 01:28:09.030]  It was a train station.
[01:28:09.690 --> 01:28:16.995]  And they were simulating a plane exploding over on its way into Midway Airport.
[01:28:17.255 --> 01:28:20.537]  And they took that, they said, off the underwear bomber thing.
[01:28:20.557 --> 01:28:22.619]  So they're using a false flag to justify
[01:28:23.539 --> 01:28:24.099]  I don't know.
[01:28:39.286 --> 01:28:40.806]  That was where their big staging ground was.
[01:28:40.846 --> 01:28:44.728]  That's where, you know, the 400 to 500 National Guard troops were going to show up.
[01:28:45.468 --> 01:28:50.810]  And from there, they were going to deploy to the different events around the city of Chicago, which is huge.
[01:28:51.210 --> 01:28:53.650]  I don't know if anybody... If you've never been there, it's really big.
[01:28:53.690 --> 01:28:55.391]  There's a big downtown and then an even bigger...
[01:28:56.071 --> 01:28:58.192]  He was saying he saw you on the news.
[01:29:19.139 --> 01:29:20.821]  Yeah, well, I mean, I was all over the place.
[01:29:20.921 --> 01:29:23.464]  Both me and Douglas were just shooting video everywhere.
[01:29:24.105 --> 01:29:25.866]  And, you know, we just went right up to the National Guard.
[01:29:25.886 --> 01:29:30.632]  We got our press passes from them, and they pretty much gave us carte blanche on shooting whatever.
[01:29:30.812 --> 01:29:32.434]  And, you know, we just asked questions.
[01:29:32.474 --> 01:29:33.134]  They answered them.
[01:29:34.476 --> 01:29:36.458]  They mentioned that... What about nighttime drills?
[01:29:36.818 --> 01:29:38.280]  The Guard running around the streets at 1 a.m.? ?
[01:29:39.361 --> 01:29:47.188]  Now there was one night time drill that we went to and it was run by the city and they were, that was a couple days later, and they were very standoffish about letting anyone in.
[01:29:47.208 --> 01:29:49.170]  It was a gun confiscation drill, that was the key.
[01:29:49.450 --> 01:29:57.618]  Well they were going into a train with the SWAT team and they didn't want the SWAT team shown and then after that they were doing decontamination.
[01:29:58.118 --> 01:30:04.645]  Mainly what the National Guard, from what we saw, they were doing decontamination exercises of people except
[01:30:05.285 --> 01:30:14.328]  With the one terror drill where they were going to take out some terrorists and then free some hostages, and then there was a chemical spill in there, and that was with the Boy Scouts.
[01:30:14.468 --> 01:30:22.530]  They were all... Okay, we're going to get to the Polish troops and the video you have of this, and of course we'll also hold up some of these documents you have.
[01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:25.651]  We can show the document, Cam, from the ceiling and see some of those.
[01:30:25.671 --> 01:30:29.192]  But Douglas, give me your take and breakdown, your report on what you saw.
[01:30:30.772 --> 01:30:41.609]  The thing that was difficult to wrap your mind around was that they would couch these, each segment of this training exercise was couched in something that was completely innocuous.
[01:30:41.869 --> 01:30:42.811]  You know, a plane crash.
[01:30:43.576 --> 01:30:55.479]  Of course it's a plane crash, but then all of a sudden they start swinging into, there was terrorist information found inside of the plane, and then they're, you know, interrogating the people who just fell out of the sky.
[01:30:56.420 --> 01:31:11.904]  You know, they take these training exercises, they have all these different spins that happen with them, and so it's not the original just a plane crash, it's all of these other things, and they're following this trail of where, you know, they got information from citizens who just fell out of the sky.
[01:31:12.544 --> 01:31:14.646]  And now they can go in any direction that they want.
[01:31:15.566 --> 01:31:17.368]  Or... Well, yeah, you'll have the cover story.
[01:31:17.928 --> 01:31:26.415]  It's like, oh, we're training for Macedonia, and then you get there and they're training to take over San Francisco in the Urban Warrior one I went to with the Marines and the foreign troops in Oakland.
[01:31:26.455 --> 01:31:27.075]  I have the footage.
[01:31:27.115 --> 01:31:27.816]  It's in Police State 2000.
[01:31:29.157 --> 01:31:33.880]  It's all there of them saying, you know, we're trying to take on Americans in San Francisco, and they have mock interrogations.
[01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:35.101]  Where'd you get the weapons?
[01:31:35.121 --> 01:31:35.922]  Where'd you get the helmet?
[01:31:36.162 --> 01:31:37.483]  Well, I got it in San Francisco.
[01:31:37.523 --> 01:31:38.604]  Well, why are you in Oakland?
[01:31:39.024 --> 01:31:39.864]  You know, I'm an American.
[01:31:39.925 --> 01:31:40.565]  No, not the camp.
[01:31:40.605 --> 01:31:41.145]  I have rights.
[01:31:42.006 --> 01:31:42.947]  That's all on video.
[01:31:43.488 --> 01:31:44.369]  And it's always the same.
[01:31:44.389 --> 01:31:48.014]  You know, for the public, it's like, oh, we're doing a bomb decontamination drill.
[01:31:48.414 --> 01:31:53.541]  And then you find out it's a takeover of the city council or it's a takeover of the county commissioner's office.
[01:31:53.561 --> 01:31:55.143]  I mean, I've seen this in Texas.
[01:31:55.183 --> 01:31:56.245]  I've been to them in Texas.
[01:31:56.525 --> 01:31:57.646]  So you have the cover story.
[01:31:57.927 --> 01:32:00.190]  And then as you said, it then goes off into all these other directions.
[01:32:00.410 --> 01:32:12.956]  Yeah, we were told several times that the Polish troops were only going to be there as observers, and then we find out there's Latvian troops there because Michigan's sister country, Warsaw Pact country, is Latvia.
[01:32:13.396 --> 01:32:17.418]  So they have Latvia troops there because the Michigan National Guard was also participating.
[01:32:18.018 --> 01:32:21.460]  And then Illinois is with Poland.
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:24.381]  And again, this is just compartmentalized.
[01:32:24.701 --> 01:32:28.962]  This gets our troops trained to foreign troops, it gets the other foreign troops, and now in L.E.O.
[01:32:28.982 --> 01:32:32.542]  9, they admitted 14 nations trying to quote, take on American terrorists.
[01:32:33.142 --> 01:32:42.925]  And so now the news is saying, oh, in an emergency, Canadian and Mexican troops are going to help in America, and then we had our troops up at the Olympics helping run checkpoints.
[01:32:42.945 --> 01:32:44.485]  See how we're all being acclimated.
[01:32:44.625 --> 01:32:49.728]  Oh yeah, and they do it under the guise of, oh, this is to share information and brotherhood and all this stuff.
[01:32:49.808 --> 01:32:52.630]  Well, that was like in Iowa when we had the colonel on that you got on.
[01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:56.893]  He said, yeah, we were training for gun confiscation, but what's wrong with that?
[01:32:57.213 --> 01:32:58.894]  You're making it a conspiracy theory.
[01:32:58.934 --> 01:32:59.775]  And I said, well, no, you're.
[01:33:00.215 --> 01:33:06.259]  And then the news wrote an article about me, the conspiracy theorist who scared the town about gun confiscation.
[01:33:06.299 --> 01:33:10.682]  But their original article said they worked with a local gun dealer who played the part of the terrorist.
[01:33:10.922 --> 01:33:14.224]  And they were going door to door and carding for a gun confiscation.
[01:33:14.424 --> 01:33:15.105]  He even admits it.
[01:33:15.125 --> 01:33:16.446]  We're looking for weapons caches.
[01:33:16.486 --> 01:33:19.930]  Yes, yes, we're doing a gun confiscation drill, but you shouldn't be upset about it.
[01:33:20.050 --> 01:33:20.290]  Right.
[01:33:20.791 --> 01:33:23.173]  And that's, you know, they do it all matter-of-factly.
[01:33:23.654 --> 01:33:28.038]  So break down exactly what people are going to see on this prison.
[01:33:28.319 --> 01:33:31.822]  In fact, if it comes in when the show ends, we'll just play the video in overdrive.
[01:33:31.842 --> 01:33:33.224]  If it's not, we have it.
[01:33:34.562 --> 01:33:35.383]  Awesome, it transferred.
[01:33:35.423 --> 01:33:36.304]  How long is this video?
[01:33:36.504 --> 01:33:38.325]  Well this, I cut it up into two parts.
[01:33:38.365 --> 01:33:53.439]  What you're going to see right when it starts is the guy, Captain Bright, who was kind of our liaison, who was taking us around, and then the head of the Polish, of their command group, and there's about 13 or 14 Polish soldiers along with firefighters, and then I guess
[01:33:54.019 --> 01:33:55.841]  The best thing to describe is Polish FBI.
[01:33:55.861 --> 01:34:05.271]  They wouldn't come on camera and they were kind of standoffish to us, but it was three individuals who just kind of be, you know, they were observing the whole time, but they were their equivalent of the FBI as well.
[01:34:05.291 --> 01:34:06.652]  Now, I haven't seen this yet.
[01:34:06.733 --> 01:34:10.376]  I mean, for radio listeners, do we need to narrate this?
[01:34:11.117 --> 01:34:14.701]  Yeah, as soon as they pop it up, I'll do some narration and tell them what they're seeing.
[01:34:14.721 --> 01:34:17.182]  Okay, and Douglas, you feel free to pop in.
[01:34:17.222 --> 01:34:28.085]  Now again, specifically, in this drill, and they let you in there, it was the Boy Scouts covering their faces, and this was a hostage drill, or what was this?
[01:34:28.145 --> 01:34:35.368]  The whole point of that exercise was hostages, or terrorists had taken hostages into a building and sealed it off, and then they'd also found
[01:34:36.908 --> 01:34:40.512]  Upon entry, they find chemicals, a spill which was simulated with flour.
[01:34:41.072 --> 01:34:42.894]  And so the Boy Scouts were all in that area.
[01:34:43.434 --> 01:34:49.279]  They come in, they cut the door down using those kind of rotary saws that are gas-powered.
[01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:53.063]  So they cut through, bust in, they kill the terrorists.
[01:34:53.523 --> 01:34:55.505]  And this was in the main room.
[01:34:55.545 --> 01:34:57.647]  Were you able to get the sheets on who the terrorists were?
[01:34:57.667 --> 01:34:59.769]  Because in a lot of these drills, it is American militia.
[01:35:00.209 --> 01:35:02.270]  They didn't say anything specifically.
[01:35:02.330 --> 01:35:04.511]  I went up and asked the guys and they just said, no, we're terrorists.
[01:35:04.591 --> 01:35:06.952]  I went and asked the terrorists, are you representing anybody?
[01:35:06.992 --> 01:35:08.353]  Are you with any particular group?
[01:35:08.393 --> 01:35:13.115]  And they said, no, we're just... Because in Michigan they had the drills in the schools where they were people against public school.
[01:35:13.155 --> 01:35:14.316]  They were homeschool families.
[01:35:14.456 --> 01:35:14.716]  Right.
[01:35:14.916 --> 01:35:17.017]  And they told the kids that we're attacking the school.
[01:35:17.297 --> 01:35:17.798]  Yeah.
[01:35:17.858 --> 01:35:19.178]  Which is a demonization tactic.
[01:35:19.498 --> 01:35:23.801]  I didn't get that particular information from them, but what was clear and
[01:35:24.941 --> 01:35:27.483]  In the main room it was all Illinois State Police.
[01:35:28.003 --> 01:35:34.428]  And then we look over and there's this little spiral staircase and all of a sudden there's Polish troops there and they never mentioned that they were going to be participating in the exercise.
[01:35:34.828 --> 01:35:45.455]  And all of a sudden they start coming down the stairs and then they're kind of cordoning off the Boy Scouts at gunpoint and they're holding them there and there was another terrorist staging group there and they actually used a hand grenade.
[01:35:46.636 --> 01:35:47.437]  Oh really?
[01:35:47.477 --> 01:35:57.372]  Well I want to add that in Road to Tyranny we interviewed a Marine Corps Captain who in the 80's was actually raiding gun dealers' homes and offices in a police jacket.
[01:35:57.953 --> 01:36:00.938]  And so they've actually got military engaging in raids everywhere.
[01:36:00.958 --> 01:36:02.460]  That's the next level of secrecy.
[01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:05.021]  Well, one of the exercises was taking down a meth lab.
[01:36:05.121 --> 01:36:17.488]  They find a meth lab, so it's automatically this, instead of a local law enforcement issue, becomes a terrorist plot because it's, you know, chemical or biological or, you know, they kind of just take, you know, meth lab and turn that into... It's mission creep!
[01:36:18.008 --> 01:36:20.651]  I mean, that's like they charged Atari with weapons of mass destruction.
[01:36:21.332 --> 01:36:30.761]  A 7.6239 rifle that fires 7.6239 eastern block rounds is now a WMD, a weapon of mass destruction.
[01:36:30.782 --> 01:36:32.463]  And of course, now the judges ordered him to release it.
[01:36:32.483 --> 01:36:33.304]  It was all staged.
[01:36:34.625 --> 01:36:35.066]  Exactly.
[01:36:35.626 --> 01:36:37.308]  And that all happened with the Patriot Act.
[01:36:39.589 --> 01:36:40.130]  That's Section 802.
[01:36:40.210 --> 01:36:43.813]  Any action that endangers human life is a violation of any federal or state law.
[01:36:53.894 --> 01:37:02.460]  When I saw the Polish guys in full combat gear, that's when I started to get pretty shaken, especially when they were right on top of the Boy Scouts.
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:03.621]  Well, they were participating.
[01:37:03.641 --> 01:37:12.167]  I mean, the thing that struck me was when we went to the nighttime drill for Chicago, their PR person, that was run more like a show.
[01:37:12.787 --> 01:37:15.309]  They had the press cordoned off to an area.
[01:37:15.349 --> 01:37:16.850]  You were only allowed to see certain things.
[01:37:16.890 --> 01:37:18.311]  We were there for three and a half hours.
[01:37:18.331 --> 01:37:22.114]  We have no idea what they were doing around there, because they had us staring at a hole.
[01:37:22.594 --> 01:37:27.317]  They had all the press staring at a hole with, you know, their mimicked question-answer session.
[01:37:27.837 --> 01:37:34.581]  And they said, point-blank, there would not be any participation between the Polish troops or any of the foreign troops in what was going on.
[01:37:34.601 --> 01:37:35.161]  So they lied.
[01:37:35.502 --> 01:37:36.822]  As observers only.
[01:37:36.982 --> 01:37:37.503]  So they lied.
[01:37:37.543 --> 01:37:38.063]  Of course they did.
[01:37:38.483 --> 01:37:39.344]  How long is the first clip?
[01:37:40.115 --> 01:37:41.477]  It should be about four minutes.
[01:37:41.497 --> 01:37:42.318]  Let's go ahead and get to that.
[01:37:42.918 --> 01:37:44.360]  Here is a clip, a video.
[01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:46.141]  It will be up at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:37:46.161 --> 01:37:48.764]  We're also streaming it live at PrisonPlanet.tv and we'll narrate it.
[01:37:50.005 --> 01:37:53.309]  On the left is the Polish commander and on the right is the American.
[01:37:53.789 --> 01:37:56.712]  The Green Beret guys are going to be the Polish troops.
[01:37:56.933 --> 01:37:58.654]  That was probably the largest group of them.
[01:37:59.555 --> 01:38:05.140]  And, um, that's, uh, those are Douglas' shots from the, uh, abandoned houses that they were using.
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:10.184]  This is a whole neighborhood, basically, that O'Hare has been acquiring for the past 15 years.
[01:38:10.304 --> 01:38:10.544]  Right.
[01:38:11.405 --> 01:38:14.528]  And so they had this, basically, free reign to conduct their exercise here.
[01:38:15.488 --> 01:38:19.832]  And, um, you know, the Polish guys ended up donning hazmat suits at one point.
[01:38:19.852 --> 01:38:22.534]  They're wearing the orange hazmat suits when we get to that.
[01:38:22.574 --> 01:38:28.119]  But here's the whole convoy coming in, um, to start the, uh, terror exercises for that day.
[01:38:30.642 --> 01:38:32.744]  Good job guys, this is really powerful footage.
[01:38:33.605 --> 01:38:34.666]  There's the foreign troops.
[01:38:35.267 --> 01:38:38.491]  And actually these two guys walking towards us, those are the two Latvian troops.
[01:38:39.332 --> 01:38:40.833]  So there's Latvian and Polish.
[01:38:40.873 --> 01:38:41.514]  Right, right.
[01:38:41.554 --> 01:38:45.999]  These are the only two Latvian guys and then you'll notice there'll be some guys in a black, full black uniform.
[01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:50.184]  They're actually a fire department in Poland and then I'll point out the
[01:38:51.445 --> 01:38:53.025]  The Polish FBI.
[01:38:53.426 --> 01:38:54.926]  I guess that's the best name for them.
[01:38:54.986 --> 01:38:56.586]  Yeah, they kept calling them FBI.
[01:38:56.607 --> 01:38:58.867]  I don't know if that just sounded nicer.
[01:38:59.407 --> 01:39:00.388]  Seemed more secretive.
[01:39:00.408 --> 01:39:02.128]  Bureau of Counterterrorist Operations.
[01:39:02.348 --> 01:39:03.028]  BOA.
[01:39:03.088 --> 01:39:03.969]  Oh yeah, let's show again.
[01:39:04.029 --> 01:39:07.129]  Have we shown those documents yet?
[01:39:07.169 --> 01:39:08.910]  He pointed that out with the Polish troops.
[01:39:09.330 --> 01:39:12.671]  We got this from Toyota Park and there's just the different troops that were there.
[01:39:12.731 --> 01:39:13.411]  There are the kids.
[01:39:13.611 --> 01:39:15.372]  I got quick shots of all the
[01:39:16.132 --> 01:39:17.953]  You know, I didn't want to really put the kids' faces on.
[01:39:17.973 --> 01:39:21.655]  There's the... Yeah, even though they let us in, we don't show the kids' faces, and that's good.
[01:39:22.716 --> 01:39:24.217]  But of course, some of these are teenagers.
[01:39:24.237 --> 01:39:25.918]  There's the terrorists going in right there.
[01:39:26.358 --> 01:39:29.480]  And they're going into... And then here come the troops.
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:33.842]  This is the Illinois National Guard coming in to cut through the doorway.
[01:39:33.862 --> 01:39:38.705]  Illinois National Guard with state police and foreign troops fighting the terrorists.
[01:39:40.266 --> 01:39:42.747]  And the terrorists are two guys, you know, with guns.
[01:39:42.767 --> 01:39:43.128]  They didn't...
[01:39:44.265 --> 01:39:48.909]  Of course, then they had their biological agent, which I guess they never really mentioned what that was.
[01:39:48.929 --> 01:39:49.930]  You guys got everything.
[01:39:49.970 --> 01:39:53.092]  You got him cutting through the door from the inside and the outside.
[01:39:53.132 --> 01:39:53.713]  Great job.
[01:39:54.193 --> 01:40:03.161]  Unfortunately, right now we're missing the flash bomb that the Polish troops used to blow out the front of the building and go in through there.
[01:40:03.261 --> 01:40:05.362]  They told us about the national guard.
[01:40:05.403 --> 01:40:06.784]  They put us in here in the back.
[01:40:06.804 --> 01:40:10.206]  But we didn't learn about the Polish troops until seconds before it happened.
[01:40:10.587 --> 01:40:12.108]  That's how the information was being disseminated.
[01:40:12.128 --> 01:40:15.330]  Okay, and you were having some computer problems right beforehand.
[01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:17.991]  Can we play it tomorrow, or are we going to have time to play that flashbang video?
[01:40:18.452 --> 01:40:19.072]  We didn't get it.
[01:40:19.112 --> 01:40:20.853]  They didn't tell us until moments before.
[01:40:20.933 --> 01:40:21.753]  Oh, I misunderstood.
[01:40:21.793 --> 01:40:23.334]  I thought you said you hadn't dumped that video yet.
[01:40:23.354 --> 01:40:25.315]  We coordinated it at the same time.
[01:40:25.415 --> 01:40:29.398]  There was the sawing of the door, which we were told about days ahead of time.
[01:40:29.598 --> 01:40:29.758]  Right.
[01:40:29.778 --> 01:40:32.839]  But then two seconds before it happened, the flash bomb goes off.
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:34.460]  We're going to have Polish guys come from the front.
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:40.384]  And here are the kids being trained how to go into learned helplessness submission fetal positions.
[01:40:41.465 --> 01:40:48.854]  And then of course they separately get these Explorer Scout 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and have them with mock guns take on disgruntled veterans.
[01:40:48.894 --> 01:40:49.815]  That's the New York Times.
[01:40:50.355 --> 01:40:53.940]  And I guess one of the commanders here is a Scoutmaster.
[01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:56.883]  And the side of the patch there, it'll say BOA.
[01:40:57.083 --> 01:40:59.386]  And that's their telltale
[01:41:00.327 --> 01:41:02.048]  Bureau of Anti-Terrorism.
[01:41:02.068 --> 01:41:21.439]  Well, I've noticed with this, I was watching old duck-and-cover videos and also government-produced COG, Continued Government videos, one shot in Portland, Oregon, and it's all about martial law during a nuclear attack, and there they teach everybody learned helplessness, and how you're gonna be nuked, and you get under the table.
[01:41:21.499 --> 01:41:23.220]  It's the same thing with the kids now in schools.
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:26.762]  You get down on your knees, and really it's about submitting to the authority.
[01:41:27.302 --> 01:41:32.685]  When a crisis happens, you get in a fetal position and wait to be shot in the back of the head, or wait to be loaded on a truck.
[01:41:33.105 --> 01:41:41.030]  So all the kids in America are taught, go with the men with guns, go to the FEMA camp, get on your knees, you know, they're gonna take good care of you.
[01:41:44.085 --> 01:41:45.245]  on his shoulder right there.
[01:42:03.697 --> 01:42:04.117]  I don't
[01:42:24.122 --> 01:42:26.303]  This is the military having mock drills.
[01:42:27.043 --> 01:42:29.925]  This is all about believing in the imaginary terror monster.
[01:42:29.945 --> 01:42:40.070]  This is just all part of mass mind control, a giant... The whole thing, they couldn't have one that was just, you know, a natural disaster or something that was, you know, just regular.
[01:42:40.330 --> 01:42:42.391]  It always had to have a terror plot at the end.
[01:42:42.951 --> 01:42:48.234]  They always found another piece of the puzzle that brought them closer to the terror plot.
[01:42:48.254 --> 01:42:49.194]  Total Mind Control.
[01:42:49.254 --> 01:42:49.994]  Gentlemen, stay there.
[01:42:50.034 --> 01:42:51.735]  Final segment with your final thoughts.
[01:42:51.995 --> 01:42:53.096]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:55.620 --> 01:42:58.943]  It's the number one reason for slow and clogged bath drains.
[01:42:59.223 --> 01:43:00.544]  That's right, hair.
[01:43:00.884 --> 01:43:03.827]  And the number one way to open drains plugged with hair?
[01:43:04.087 --> 01:43:05.148]  The drain claw.
[01:43:06.009 --> 01:43:07.950]  Stop standing in dirty bath water.
[01:43:08.191 --> 01:43:09.852]  Stop using dangerous chemicals.
[01:43:10.092 --> 01:43:14.516]  Just push the drain claw past the pop-up in your sink or tub, twist, and pull.
[01:43:14.536 --> 01:43:18.199]  You'll be shocked at what this little tool can pull out of your drain.
[01:43:18.459 --> 01:43:25.442]  The Drain Claw has over 100 tiny hooks that claw through hair, toothpaste and shampoo that slows and clogs your drains.

[01:43:55.205 --> 01:44:00.066]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:44:00.166 --> 01:44:00.966]  What have we got?
[01:44:01.166 --> 01:44:03.307]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:44:03.607 --> 01:44:04.367]  A republic.
[01:44:04.627 --> 01:44:07.187]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:44:07.267 --> 01:44:09.188]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:44:09.528 --> 01:44:11.448]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:44:11.568 --> 01:44:12.828]  So they think they own our land?
[01:44:13.249 --> 01:44:14.349]  They think they own our water?
[01:44:14.569 --> 01:44:14.949]  Children?
[01:44:15.169 --> 01:44:15.949]  Our education?
[01:44:16.289 --> 01:44:16.909]  Our money?
[01:44:17.129 --> 01:44:20.770]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:44:21.132 --> 01:44:24.795]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:44:24.855 --> 01:44:25.796]  You have been warned!
[01:44:26.116 --> 01:44:26.937]  We have the facts.
[01:44:27.137 --> 01:44:28.258]  We have the Constitution.
[01:44:28.298 --> 01:44:29.179]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:44:29.199 --> 01:44:30.040]  We have common law.
[01:44:30.100 --> 01:44:32.342]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:32.622 --> 01:44:35.344]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[01:44:35.565 --> 01:44:36.425]  Rise of the Republic.
[01:44:36.505 --> 01:44:41.290]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:44:41.470 --> 01:44:42.811]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:44:42.971 --> 01:44:43.792]  Don't Tread on Me.
[01:44:44.052 --> 01:44:45.273]  Order it at InfoWars.com.
[01:44:55.297 --> 01:44:55.837]  You worry.
[01:44:55.977 --> 01:44:58.058]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[01:44:58.338 --> 01:44:58.598]  Hi.
[01:44:58.878 --> 01:45:01.359]  Summer's coming, and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[01:45:01.659 --> 01:45:05.900]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:08.381]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[01:45:08.661 --> 01:45:11.702]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[01:45:12.102 --> 01:45:12.642]  We're good to go.
[01:45:33.049 --> 01:45:33.810]  We're good to go.
[01:46:20.051 --> 01:46:34.461]  Livin' on the road, my friend Was gonna keep you free and clean And now you wear your skin like iron And your breath as hard as kerosene
[01:46:35.862 --> 01:46:43.494]  You weren't your mama's only boy, but her favorite one it seemed.
[01:46:43.755 --> 01:46:47.701]  She began to cry when you said goodbye.
[01:46:51.763 --> 01:46:53.284]  We only got about five minutes left.
[01:46:53.544 --> 01:46:58.626]  The military now admits they're going to carry out operations in the United States, Brigade Homeland.
[01:46:58.646 --> 01:47:09.270]  They're going to help with crashed cars, air flights, fight drunk driving, the FBI, CIA, Pentagon funding fusion centers locally.
[01:47:09.290 --> 01:47:11.251]  I mean, the Feds are taking everything over.
[01:47:11.271 --> 01:47:12.911]  They're training the kids to spy on their parents.
[01:47:13.291 --> 01:47:14.852]  This is the opposite of what our country is.
[01:47:14.872 --> 01:47:18.533]  But now the new patriotism is, salute the troops and the foreign troops.
[01:47:18.693 --> 01:47:19.634]  But you had a point you wanted to make.
[01:47:20.194 --> 01:47:31.545]  Well, uh, when we first got there, the thing that, you know, was such a stark difference to G20, where we were vermin and, you know, spit on, tear gas thrown at us, was how they just rolled out the carpet for us.
[01:47:31.605 --> 01:47:36.170]  I mean, we were like VIPs, just nobodies from, you know, an affiliate in Rockwell.
[01:47:36.510 --> 01:47:37.390]  Because they're selling the fear.
[01:47:37.450 --> 01:47:38.411]  They want you to see this.
[01:47:38.431 --> 01:47:38.671]  Exactly.
[01:47:38.691 --> 01:47:42.353]  What I found out later was that in Alaska, apparently it didn't go so well.
[01:47:42.433 --> 01:47:45.574]  They didn't have as much contact with the press, so people ran with it.
[01:47:45.634 --> 01:47:48.495]  They said that they were locking them up for internment camps.
[01:47:48.955 --> 01:47:52.797]  And the guy that was talking to me about this, you know, was very concerned that the press... This is the military.
[01:47:52.917 --> 01:47:53.077]  Right.
[01:47:53.117 --> 01:47:55.958]  That the press might have a negative image of what's going on.
[01:47:56.439 --> 01:47:57.579]  So that's why we were let in.
[01:47:57.639 --> 01:48:01.321]  That's why they rolled out the red carpet, because they wanted
[01:48:02.697 --> 01:48:03.838]  You know, to seem transparent.
[01:48:03.878 --> 01:48:05.599]  It's this new transparency.
[01:48:05.619 --> 01:48:09.501]  So you're allowed to see the kids being put in fetal positions with the foreign troops?
[01:48:10.201 --> 01:48:11.082]  We have nothing to hide.
[01:48:11.102 --> 01:48:12.182]  It's the new America.
[01:48:12.222 --> 01:48:13.443]  It's all out there, right in front.
[01:48:14.524 --> 01:48:15.024]  For us to see.
[01:48:15.544 --> 01:48:18.146]  So you were talking to one of the members of the military and they were telling you this?
[01:48:18.166 --> 01:48:18.246]  Yes.
[01:48:19.191 --> 01:48:20.232]  This is at the night drill.
[01:48:20.272 --> 01:48:21.432]  They were in plain clothes.
[01:48:21.712 --> 01:48:22.533]  We don't get it.
[01:48:22.593 --> 01:48:25.294]  Suddenly the American people don't trust us anymore.
[01:48:25.314 --> 01:48:29.416]  We've got to try Operation Counter-Pro or Counter-Intel-Pro.
[01:48:29.596 --> 01:48:31.857]  I don't know.
[01:48:32.097 --> 01:48:36.959]  I was kind of amazed at how much they were just like, you want us to take you around on the golf cart and we'll show you all the vehicles?
[01:48:37.379 --> 01:48:38.259]  But that's the whole thing.
[01:48:38.279 --> 01:48:44.002]  It's like the face of the New World Order is your brother, your sister, your mother, your father.
[01:48:44.282 --> 01:48:46.183]  They don't know what they're a part of.
[01:48:46.923 --> 01:48:47.884]  They're doing their job.
[01:48:47.924 --> 01:48:52.126]  They think they're trying to save us because all of these drills are natural disasters.
[01:48:52.166 --> 01:48:53.867]  You know, they're coming in to save us.
[01:48:54.087 --> 01:49:01.591]  And then they mix that in with all these fake drills to create, like, one for a hurricane, one for a tornado, one for a flood.
[01:49:01.671 --> 01:49:04.313]  Next, one for al-Qaeda attacking.
[01:49:05.421 --> 01:49:06.322]  Yeah, and that's it.
[01:49:06.342 --> 01:49:13.505]  I mean, it's just blurring the lines of what their responsibilities are and then what happens when, you know, it hits the fan.
[01:49:14.106 --> 01:49:17.187]  They suddenly come in and they want to take over every, you know, every aspect.
[01:49:17.268 --> 01:49:21.190]  And then the culmination of all of these drills, you know, we heard about all these aspects.
[01:49:22.170 --> 01:49:25.232]  We came in, they were very transparent about what was going on.
[01:49:25.672 --> 01:49:27.353]  You know, this is happening at this time.
[01:49:27.753 --> 01:49:36.738]  But it's funny, the thing that they didn't mention that's in none of the literature is that the culmination of the exercise at the Naoko Chemical Plant was a civil disturbance.
[01:49:36.878 --> 01:49:37.058]  Yep.
[01:49:37.559 --> 01:49:38.459]  Oh, this is key!
[01:49:38.479 --> 01:49:38.799]  Yeah.
[01:49:38.819 --> 01:49:40.921]  Toyota Park, they didn't, uh, we got word of it.
[01:49:41.901 --> 01:49:48.148]  Um, the night before it was happening, he said, yeah, we're going to have a civil disturbance at Toyota Park, which is where their staging ground was.
[01:49:48.188 --> 01:49:50.070]  And we're like, oh, that's not in any of your literature.
[01:49:50.110 --> 01:49:52.292]  And he goes, oh, we just decided to do this one off the cuff.
[01:49:52.412 --> 01:49:54.194]  And we worked right up to the last minute.
[01:49:54.214 --> 01:49:56.036]  We were at the Nalco chemical plant.
[01:49:56.877 --> 01:49:59.840]  And, uh, basically we went straight from there to the airplane.
[01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:00.540]  Yeah.
[01:50:00.900 --> 01:50:07.742]  We were capturing everything that we could and we heard just at the last minute, oh yeah, and then the culmination of these exercises is a civil disturbance.
[01:50:08.002 --> 01:50:08.642]  Did you get that?
[01:50:08.922 --> 01:50:09.303]  We didn't.
[01:50:09.403 --> 01:50:12.664]  That was probably about two hours after we took off on our flight.
[01:50:13.544 --> 01:50:16.245]  Oh, so they were scheduled up to a point.
[01:50:16.285 --> 01:50:17.845]  You shot to when they said they were scheduled.
[01:50:17.885 --> 01:50:24.767]  They said, oh, there's something at the end, which is the civil disturbance, knowing media would have pre-programmed when they could be there.
[01:50:25.387 --> 01:50:28.531]  Oh, and we missed the civil disturbance and them taking on the American people.
[01:50:28.551 --> 01:50:30.433]  It was a Thursday night thing that was gonna happen.
[01:50:30.453 --> 01:50:32.074]  But we got the foreign troops.
[01:50:32.155 --> 01:50:32.995]  Great job, guys.
[01:50:33.036 --> 01:50:34.197]  Retransmission starts now.
[01:50:34.257 --> 01:50:35.418]  Infowars.com on the screen.
