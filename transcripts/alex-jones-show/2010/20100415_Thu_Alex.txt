[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:00.689]  Cover-ups.
[00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:02.130]  You want answers?
[00:00:02.911 --> 00:00:03.811]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:04.452 --> 00:00:08.154]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:12.697]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:13.976 --> 00:00:24.042]  Coming up in the next hour, Lord Christopher Monckton, one of the key Tea Party speakers in Washington, will be joining us on government-run healthcare in England, on all the latest on Climategate.
[00:00:24.302 --> 00:00:27.584]  Devastating news has broken this week of the systematic fraud.
[00:00:27.644 --> 00:00:28.384]  That's coming up.
[00:00:28.965 --> 00:00:35.448]  We're going to premiere my newest documentary that I've produced, Jason Burma's directed, Invisible Empire, New Order Defined, at 3 p.m.
[00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:37.229]  Central
[00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.912]  is how the economy was lost, the war of the worlds, Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:00:59.032 --> 00:01:06.595]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is with us and before he sails off into the sunset, at least for a while, taking a break, he's agreed to do a couple interviews with us.
[00:01:06.615 --> 00:01:19.280]  He did one last week and now he's back on tax day this week to talk about the economy, the value-added taxes, all the things, the carbon taxes they're calling for, and what he talked about last week, the systematic destruction by design
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:28.543]  of our economy, the total conversion to basically Mexico or another third world nation where you have a tiny elite and a giant underclass.
[00:01:29.143 --> 00:01:31.203]  Dr. Roberts, great to have you here with us today, sir.
[00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:33.144]  Pleased to be with you, Alex.
[00:01:33.944 --> 00:01:36.405]  You look good there with your Skype connection.
[00:01:36.425 --> 00:01:38.986]  I see you've got Napoleon Bonaparte on the wall behind you.
[00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:48.033]  Yes, somebody gave me that some years ago when the President of France gave me the French Legion of Honour.
[00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:56.259]  And I can't remember who it was, somebody gave me this very romantic picture of a copy.
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.325]  This is a copy of the romantic portrayal of Napoleon that's in the Louvre in Paris.
[00:02:04.406 --> 00:02:04.686]  Wow.
[00:02:04.886 --> 00:02:09.568]  Yeah, you never brag about all the laurels you've got in one of the top ten economists living on the planet.
[00:02:10.148 --> 00:02:10.748]  You know the drill.
[00:02:10.768 --> 00:02:14.329]  We're going to break in about three minutes, but you wanted to come on on Tax Day.
[00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.349]  We're honored to have you here.
[00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:16.330]  We won't be censored.
[00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.510]  Break it down for us.
[00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.452]  Well, you know, Alex, one of the great myths is that Americans are free people.
[00:02:24.642 --> 00:02:27.364]  And once upon a time they were, but they've not been free since 1913.
[00:02:29.446 --> 00:02:34.889]  Because once you have an income tax, you no longer own your own labor.
[00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:43.696]  And the historic definition of a free person is a person who owns his own labor.
[00:02:44.376 --> 00:02:49.700]  If you don't own your own labor, you are a serf or a slave.
[00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:52.062]  So all Americans,
[00:02:53.138 --> 00:02:56.501]  Or either serfs or slaves, depending on the bracket.
[00:02:57.542 --> 00:02:59.384]  There are no free Americans.
[00:03:00.184 --> 00:03:03.647]  And have not been any free Americans since 1913.
[00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:13.676]  So when you hear our leaders, such as George W. Bush, talk about, we have freedom and democracy.
[00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:16.098]  You certainly don't have freedom.
[00:03:16.158 --> 00:03:16.719]  You're a serf.
[00:03:18.032 --> 00:03:27.179]  All serfs were required to turn over twenty, thirty percent of their labor time to the government of their day.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.364]  A slave has to turn over about half of his labor time to his owner.
[00:03:35.026 --> 00:03:39.950]  And Americans fall in between those two ranges.
[00:03:40.951 --> 00:03:47.136]  So every American who works and earns an income is either
[00:03:48.197 --> 00:03:52.418]  Surf or slave or in between that margin.
[00:03:52.598 --> 00:04:05.922]  And that is simply the historic definition of a free person agreed to by the liberals, by Karl Marx, by the conservatives, by all historians.
[00:04:06.102 --> 00:04:08.882]  That is the definition of a free person.
[00:04:09.863 --> 00:04:12.263]  We don't meet that definition.
[00:04:12.783 --> 00:04:14.284]  And people should be aware of this.
[00:04:15.526 --> 00:04:17.989]  And that's the real message of April 15.
[00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:24.256]  It reminds you every year that you're not a free man or woman.
[00:04:25.177 --> 00:04:28.700]  You are a serf of the government.
[00:04:29.704 --> 00:04:34.228]  Who has a claim to, what, one third of your income?
[00:04:34.908 --> 00:04:35.329]  Or more.
[00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:37.090]  Stay there, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:44.856]  We'll look at the history of the income tax, how it's been accelerating and expanding, and a lot more, and how we try to shake off this bondage.
[00:04:45.196 --> 00:04:45.997]  And your phone calls.
[00:04:46.037 --> 00:04:48.319]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts with us in the next hour.
[00:04:48.359 --> 00:04:49.360]  We're very honored to have him.
[00:04:52.402 --> 00:04:54.484]  Max, what did you do with the remote?

[00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.953]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:07:27.133 --> 00:07:32.857]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:07:32.957 --> 00:07:36.359]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:07:36.599 --> 00:07:39.201]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:07:39.301 --> 00:07:44.224]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[00:07:53.852 --> 00:07:59.877]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:00.478 --> 00:08:03.641]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:05.683 --> 00:08:11.668]  Many times when Congressman Ron Paul is on Fox or CNN or MSNBC, they'll say, you're against the government.
[00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:12.849]  You hate the government.
[00:08:13.823 --> 00:08:15.364]  How are we supposed to fund our country?
[00:08:15.624 --> 00:08:21.227]  And many times he's standing in the Capitol or the Capitals behind him and he says, well, we built this Capitol.
[00:08:21.807 --> 00:08:26.549]  Our country had a 10% growth rate on average until 1913 when we got the income tax.
[00:08:26.889 --> 00:08:29.030]  That you will notice is in the Communist Manifesto.
[00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:31.271]  So is a private central bank.
[00:08:31.311 --> 00:08:32.952]  And we have been turned into serfs.
[00:08:33.312 --> 00:08:35.954]  Not just with the income tax, but property tax is a rent.
[00:08:36.334 --> 00:08:38.195]  Serfs paid a property tax.
[00:08:38.895 --> 00:08:44.377]  As well, and since 1913 it just expands and expands and expands and expands.
[00:08:44.457 --> 00:08:49.879]  Now the bankers, Volcker and others, want a value-added tax, sales taxes, carbon taxes.
[00:08:50.439 --> 00:08:51.760]  It's all being announced.
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.681]  Former Wall Street Journal editor, for those that just joined us, father of Reaganomics,
[00:08:56.261 --> 00:08:56.642]  Oh, Alex.
[00:09:17.398 --> 00:09:18.499]  My phone has started ringing.
[00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:19.740]  Can I get up and turn it off?
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.260]  I'm sorry.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:20.740]  Sure, go ahead.
[00:09:21.501 --> 00:09:23.422]  You gotta love live TV here in radio.
[00:09:23.762 --> 00:09:26.984]  And for those that just joined us, we are live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:09:27.004 --> 00:09:32.448]  You can see all the great awards Dr. Roberts has in the back, including the Legion of Merit from France.
[00:09:32.468 --> 00:09:33.489]  That's their highest award.
[00:09:33.529 --> 00:09:34.870]  He is something else.
[00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:36.391]  Never even knew he had that.
[00:09:37.311 --> 00:09:39.813]  But, gotta love live TV.
[00:09:40.033 --> 00:09:46.778]  Okay, Dr. Roberts, continuing, recapping our journey to serfdom, and now it's only accelerating deeper into bondage.
[00:09:47.677 --> 00:10:02.269]  Well, you know, the main point, Alex, was that a free person owns his own labor, and an income tax means the government has the first claim on your labor, just like feudal lords did, or a slave master.
[00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.813]  And so Americans are not free, and haven't been for almost a century now.
[00:10:07.173 --> 00:10:14.820]  We're three years short of a century of living as serfs, while the government tells us that we have freedom.
[00:10:16.347 --> 00:10:37.965]  You know, under the Constitution, the income tax is unconstitutional, and certainly nobody in the latter part of the 18th century was going to propose an income tax since it was so close to the time that serfs were becoming free labor, as opposed to serfs.
[00:10:39.306 --> 00:10:48.811]  The notion of having the government have a claim on your labor would have been seen as a step back into the dark ages, or into the medieval period.
[00:10:49.812 --> 00:10:52.693]  And so, how did we get the income tax?
[00:10:52.754 --> 00:10:56.556]  Well, the Democrats wanted it to get the rich.
[00:10:57.316 --> 00:11:02.279]  And they got one passed, and it was ruled unconstitutional, and they had to have a constitutional amendment.
[00:11:03.476 --> 00:11:14.166]  And the way they got it, if my memory serves, the Republicans wanted a higher tariff to protect the industries.
[00:11:14.987 --> 00:11:17.970]  During our great growth period, we had high tariffs.
[00:11:19.371 --> 00:11:22.854]  We did not develop on the basis of free trade.
[00:11:24.056 --> 00:11:26.978]  So, in order to get the tariff,
[00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:37.135]  The Democrats said, look, tariffs are like sales taxes, and they're regressive, and the people have to pay it who don't have a lot of money.
[00:11:37.175 --> 00:11:50.101]  And so if you will go along with letting us have a go at a constitutional amendment on the income tax, we'll let you have your tariffs.
[00:11:51.784 --> 00:11:59.293]  And the Republicans all said, well, you know, the states will never pass this, so let's make the deal so we can get a higher tariff.
[00:12:00.995 --> 00:12:04.880]  So they made the deal, and when it went out to the states,
[00:12:07.901 --> 00:12:18.104]  The states looked at it and said, well look, look how much money you have to have before you even hit a 1% income tax rate.
[00:12:18.424 --> 00:12:20.685]  Nobody in our state has that much money.
[00:12:21.325 --> 00:12:24.326]  We don't care if this passes, it doesn't affect us.
[00:12:26.127 --> 00:12:33.849]  And so, it passed because the majority of the states came to the conclusion that nobody in the state had an income that large.
[00:12:36.038 --> 00:12:40.686]  But of course, as soon as this ends, World War I starts.
[00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:44.974]  And of course, they want to finance the war.
[00:12:45.314 --> 00:12:46.516]  And so all of a sudden...
[00:12:47.765 --> 00:13:01.172]  The thresholds at which the tax comes in are lowered, the rates at which are charged are raised, and the whole population is almost subject to the income tax, which was only going to be for the rich.
[00:13:01.553 --> 00:13:03.714]  Well, that's how it happened.
[00:13:03.734 --> 00:13:06.976]  That's how it came into effect.
[00:13:07.636 --> 00:13:12.579]  It was a miscalculation as a part of a deal
[00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:26.389]  To be able to raise a tariff in exchange for giving the Democrats a go at a constitutional amendment to make income tax permissible.
[00:13:26.709 --> 00:13:29.331]  Well, Dr. Roberts, let me add a caveat before you continue.
[00:13:29.752 --> 00:13:35.956]  We notice in the same year, 1913, we get the income tax to now fund the new central bank.
[00:13:37.057 --> 00:13:39.139]  That so many of our forefathers had fought against.
[00:13:39.559 --> 00:13:48.987]  As Thomas Jefferson said, if you allow private corporations and banks to issue currency and credit, you will wake up homeless on the continent your forefathers conquered.
[00:13:49.667 --> 00:13:58.434]  And we also, that same year, got the 17th Amendment, taking the senators from the states, voted on by the legislatures, and making them federal creatures.
[00:13:58.815 --> 00:14:02.478]  So, further dominating the states.
[00:14:04.139 --> 00:14:23.812]  So the central banks and private banks that helped ram this through did it in the name of getting the rich guys, the robber barons, but really the robber barons that helped them vertically integrate the economy and now we see the super rich today vertically integrating the economy and waging war on the economy, economic warfare, through this system almost a hundred years later.
[00:14:25.394 --> 00:14:30.538]  That's true, and that's one of the subjects of my recent book, How the Economy Was Lost.
[00:14:31.179 --> 00:14:34.803]  You gave a very good summary of what happened.
[00:14:36.644 --> 00:14:38.586]  All of it in the name of reform.
[00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:46.694]  And of course, the reforms destroyed the federal structure and gave us the powerful central government.
[00:14:48.055 --> 00:14:56.499]  You know, the Civil War did a great job in destroying states' rights, but certain amounts of it remained until 1913.
[00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:12.632]  I want to talk more about the income tax and all the new taxes they want to pile on that are similar.
[00:15:13.052 --> 00:15:15.033]  But what about the states and property taxes?
[00:15:15.073 --> 00:15:19.455]  Many states didn't have property taxes until the last 20-30 years and they go up and up and up.
[00:15:19.796 --> 00:15:28.760]  That's another classic feudal serf tax where you didn't own the land you were on, you were the keeper of it, but you had to pay a percentage to the nobles.
[00:15:31.381 --> 00:15:33.422]  Yes, of course.
[00:15:35.719 --> 00:15:44.166]  Property taxes really aren't abortable, because even if you rent from a landlord, he has to pay the tax, so it goes into the rent.
[00:15:45.547 --> 00:15:54.334]  Property tax, the reason given for that, and what was used, was to fund public schools.
[00:15:55.427 --> 00:16:11.794]  So you find the public school system based on the property tax and therefore this made it free, so to speak, since property tax wasn't avoidable.
[00:16:13.485 --> 00:16:22.031]  And people paid the proper tax, so they used public schools, and this was a great setback to private education.
[00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:38.822]  And it was another mechanism for government to condition the thinking of people, to brainwash them through time, to make them think that they are free and have democracy, even though
[00:16:39.782 --> 00:16:40.422]  I think?
[00:16:55.656 --> 00:17:00.137]  There were slaves who had special skills.
[00:17:00.497 --> 00:17:01.978]  They were craftsmen.
[00:17:02.018 --> 00:17:07.939]  They were highly trained in some aspect of arts and crafts.
[00:17:08.659 --> 00:17:16.381]  And their labor was worth more than working in the cotton fields or working on the plantation.
[00:17:16.981 --> 00:17:19.982]  And so what would happen is the owners of the slave
[00:17:21.158 --> 00:17:48.231]  would lease the slave to a businessman in a city or town and the man who leased the slave would withhold half of the slave's earnings and send it back to the owner and give the other half to the slave which he used to maintain himself in town where he lived, you know, on his own resources after tax.
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.183]  Well, that's the way it works today.
[00:17:52.885 --> 00:17:56.511]  Most people cannot avoid income tax because they never get the money.
[00:17:56.591 --> 00:17:57.813]  It's withheld at the source.
[00:17:58.519 --> 00:18:09.043]  And by the way, we've seen this new hoax by AP and others, I see it all over the news, that 47% of Americans don't pay income tax after deductions, but what is FICA and Social Security?
[00:18:09.363 --> 00:18:16.526]  Don't they know that their employers are just paying them less because they have to pay all those other taxes and matching Social Security, FICA?
[00:18:16.546 --> 00:18:22.428]  I mean, this lie that 47% of the public are avoiding taxes is a hoax, is it not?
[00:18:22.788 --> 00:18:23.629]  Yes, it's a hoax.
[00:18:24.569 --> 00:18:27.651]  Most of the things they tell you are a hoax.
[00:18:27.671 --> 00:18:29.873]  They also tell you that the rich don't pay taxes.
[00:18:30.833 --> 00:18:37.938]  But the IRS statistics of income show that the rich pay almost all the taxes because they have most of the income.
[00:18:39.339 --> 00:18:46.444]  And so, just about everything people think they know about the income tax system is wrong.
[00:18:47.264 --> 00:18:52.968]  Well, there are some international corporations, though, in offshoring, they are avoiding a lot of taxes.
[00:18:56.583 --> 00:18:57.644]  Not necessarily.
[00:18:57.664 --> 00:19:00.445]  You see, you're taxed on your worldwide income.
[00:19:00.945 --> 00:19:16.613]  If you're paying, if you're a global corporation, say you're operating in the United States and say Europe, for example, and you're taxed in Germany and France, then that income is an offset to those earnings.
[00:19:17.814 --> 00:19:21.876]  And it is not, again, taxed by the United States government.
[00:19:22.975 --> 00:19:29.917]  So it's not really the case that they can avoid taxes.
[00:19:29.997 --> 00:19:30.637]  All right, stay there.
[00:19:30.677 --> 00:19:31.477]  We got a break then.
[00:19:31.677 --> 00:19:35.338]  Why then do we see the mega corporations always lobbying for more taxes?
[00:19:35.699 --> 00:19:38.999]  Or the big health care insurance companies lobbying for health care?
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:44.621]  We'll ask Dr. Roberts that question when we come back and talk about where he sees this nation going.
[00:19:45.221 --> 00:19:47.922]  As he said last week, the economy is being destroyed by design.
[00:19:47.942 --> 00:19:49.102]  We'll get him to expand on that.
[00:19:49.442 --> 00:19:50.423]  Stay with us, Dr. Roberts.
[00:19:50.743 --> 00:19:51.423]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:19:52.782 --> 00:19:57.043]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water filtration.

[00:21:00.345 --> 00:21:04.947]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.

[00:21:52.202 --> 00:21:55.466]  Jim Newcomer with Midas Resources, talking today about change.
[00:21:55.706 --> 00:22:00.891]  Not the change we were promised by President Obama, but the reality that we must face in these changing economic times.
[00:22:01.112 --> 00:22:08.720]  With our national debt currently exceeding $12.5 trillion, and our unfunded liabilities totaling over $107 trillion, the value of the U.S.
[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:10.642]  dollar continues its slide into oblivion.
[00:22:10.802 --> 00:22:15.263]  There's still time to ensure your financial security with precious metals, but you need to act today.
[00:22:15.544 --> 00:22:24.506]  Call me, Jim Newcomer, at 800-686-2237, extension 104, and we can explore how Midas Resources can help you secure your financial future.
[00:22:24.686 --> 00:22:32.929]  With our government continuing to find new ways to spend our money at the expense of our children and grandchildren, there's still time to acquire a true hedge against inflation with precious metals.
[00:22:33.169 --> 00:22:43.953]  Call me, Jim Newcomer, at 800-686-2237, extension 104, and we'll discuss how you can take physical possession or convert your IRA into precious metals before it's too late.
[00:22:43.973 --> 00:22:51.536]  800-686-2237, extension 104, and make the commitment today to retain the security you worked a lifetime to establish.
[00:22:52.336 --> 00:22:53.937]  Normal blood pressure, naturally.
[00:22:54.097 --> 00:22:55.217]  How would that make you feel?
[00:22:55.437 --> 00:22:56.818]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[00:22:57.158 --> 00:22:59.458]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[00:22:59.699 --> 00:23:06.981]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[00:23:07.261 --> 00:23:08.622]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[00:23:08.762 --> 00:23:11.422]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract.
[00:23:11.503 --> 00:23:16.564]  I started taking heart and body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[00:23:16.824 --> 00:23:21.866]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[00:23:22.046 --> 00:23:26.928]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.
[00:23:27.148 --> 00:23:31.189]  Order at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.

[00:23:36.851 --> 00:23:39.612]  Folks, I did not expect this at all.
[00:23:39.632 --> 00:23:44.314]  By the 7th, 8th, and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking Heart and Body Extract.
[00:23:44.354 --> 00:23:48.915]  Details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[00:24:00.399 --> 00:24:04.182]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, again, our guest, joining us on April 15, 2010.
[00:24:04.303 --> 00:24:10.168]  I want to open the phones up for Dr. Roberts, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:10.188 --> 00:24:12.610]  We'll take a few calls before he leaves us.
[00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:14.391]  Okay, Doc, this is a short segment.
[00:24:14.852 --> 00:24:19.175]  Fleshing out, expanding on that point you're making, that they're destroying the economy by design.
[00:24:19.335 --> 00:24:19.736]  Why?
[00:24:20.236 --> 00:24:26.662]  Why are some of the biggest corporations in the world, with government, pushing to turn people into indentured servants?
[00:24:28.257 --> 00:24:37.924]  Yes, well, I think to make people aware of that fact is probably more important than to know all the reasons why.
[00:24:37.944 --> 00:24:50.833]  A lot of it is a result of unintended consequences and most of the rest is a result of short-term greed.
[00:24:52.734 --> 00:24:57.678]  The way the incentive structure for top management corporations is structured
[00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:01.712]  It gives them a very short-term horizon.
[00:25:02.833 --> 00:25:04.954]  They want to know what the profits are next quarter.
[00:25:05.274 --> 00:25:08.016]  The longest horizon they have is full quarters.
[00:25:09.557 --> 00:25:21.465]  And in the way these things are structured, their bonuses that they get for performance far, far exceeds their regular salaries.
[00:25:22.346 --> 00:25:26.329]  So they make themselves multi-million dollar incomes,
[00:25:26.969 --> 00:25:40.758]  By moving American jobs offshore, because they then replace American labor with very, very inexpensive foreign labor in countries where there's a huge surplus of unemployed labor.
[00:25:41.258 --> 00:25:48.263]  In China, for example, a couple hundred million unemployed people to draw on.
[00:25:49.984 --> 00:25:58.290]  By severely cutting their labor costs, the profits jump dramatically and they get enormous bonuses.
[00:25:58.771 --> 00:26:01.993]  And that's the basic source of it.
[00:26:02.053 --> 00:26:10.620]  And it's why the prospects, the economic prospects for millions of Americans are gone.
[00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:14.242]  And not just people alive today, but future generations.
[00:26:16.064 --> 00:26:21.387]  The kinds of jobs that college graduates used to get are simply disappearing.
[00:26:22.528 --> 00:26:31.174]  They're moved abroad, or they are filled with foreign guest workers on H-1B visas and L-1 visas.
[00:26:32.034 --> 00:26:36.557]  And so it's actually making the universities redundant.
[00:26:36.617 --> 00:26:47.883]  Why in the world did you go pursue university careers with the notion of some professional career that's been destroyed by the offshoring of the jobs?
[00:26:48.483 --> 00:26:52.966]  So it's having a tremendous adverse impact on the United States.
[00:26:53.266 --> 00:26:56.447]  And you and other economists talk about how these jobs aren't coming back.
[00:26:56.507 --> 00:27:01.008]  It took hundreds of years to build what we've got, now just a few decades to destroy it.
[00:27:01.988 --> 00:27:06.449]  There was open discussion by the IMF and World Bank now of the dollar going down.
[00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:11.251]  They're saying they need more bailouts, VAT taxes, sales taxes, carbon taxes.
[00:27:11.591 --> 00:27:19.413]  When any economist worth their salt knows in a stalling economy, you throw more taxes on, that will just accelerate the economy's implosion.
[00:27:20.791 --> 00:27:21.312]  That's right.
[00:27:21.352 --> 00:27:27.837]  You see, by wrecking the economy, they have worsened the trade deficit dramatically.
[00:27:27.877 --> 00:27:32.781]  They have worsened the federal budget deficit, which they can no longer finance.
[00:27:33.121 --> 00:27:38.626]  And that is a threat to the dollar as a reserve currency, which is a threat to their power of the United States.
[00:27:39.046 --> 00:27:42.589]  And so now it looks like the hard-pressed Americans
[00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:56.259]  Could be hit with new forms of oppressive taxation such as a value-added tax on top of the income and social security tax and state sales taxes and property taxes.
[00:27:57.019 --> 00:28:07.506]  So they have by putting the dollar into jeopardy and having to rescue the dollar in order to rescue the power of the American militarist super state.
[00:28:08.186 --> 00:28:11.609]  They have to drive the population or 96% of it.
[00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:13.790]  I think?
[00:28:28.869 --> 00:28:33.330]  In a way that people haven't experienced in the longest, longest time.
[00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:54.034]  Yeah, this taxation rate is much higher for my study than what caused the colonies to rebel, but also they were having fake courts, royal courts that bypass juries, and the right of Magna Carta and habeas corpus, and you look at all those parallels, they're identical to what led up to 1775, 1776, but magnified.
[00:28:58.537 --> 00:29:00.298]  Yes, it's all a repeat, isn't it?
[00:29:00.418 --> 00:29:13.107]  The habeas corpus is gone, due process is gone, the attorney-client privilege is gone, now they force attorneys to rat on their clients.
[00:29:14.187 --> 00:29:19.170]  But of course, you know, one difference is the population a couple hundred years ago was more feisty.
[00:29:21.474 --> 00:29:27.417]  And there wasn't much difference between the weaponry in the hands of people and the weaponry in the hands of the state.
[00:29:27.818 --> 00:29:29.498]  Stay there, let's talk about that when we come back.
[00:29:29.578 --> 00:29:31.960]  Long segment coming up with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:36.022]  I'm Alex Jones, M4Wars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv are the websites.
[00:29:36.442 --> 00:29:42.005]  And when the show ends today at 3 o'clock central, we're premiering the new film, Invisible Empire, at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:29:42.365 --> 00:29:45.347]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:46.267 --> 00:29:48.949]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:52.352 --> 00:29:54.974]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:29:55.375 --> 00:30:00.339]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:02.441]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:02.742 --> 00:30:07.566]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:07.746 --> 00:30:08.707]  How much do you want?
[00:30:08.927 --> 00:30:09.688]  When do you want it?
[00:30:10.068 --> 00:30:11.650]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:12.771]  When will you need it?
[00:30:13.011 --> 00:30:15.073]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:15.233 --> 00:30:16.274]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:16.534 --> 00:30:17.875]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:18.075 --> 00:30:23.139]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:23.339 --> 00:30:26.501]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:26.921 --> 00:30:30.423]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:30.744 --> 00:30:31.724]  How much will you need?
[00:30:31.964 --> 00:30:32.585]  We don't know.
[00:30:32.885 --> 00:30:33.786]  How much do you want?
[00:30:33.986 --> 00:30:34.706]  All you can get.
[00:30:34.906 --> 00:30:35.747]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:36.007 --> 00:30:38.769]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:39.049 --> 00:30:41.231]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:46.574 --> 00:30:47.336]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:30:52.657 --> 00:31:00.764]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[00:31:01.125 --> 00:31:11.594]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[00:31:12.034 --> 00:31:17.459]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[00:31:17.999 --> 00:31:22.482]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[00:31:22.902 --> 00:31:31.628]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[00:31:31.968 --> 00:31:41.815]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[00:31:42.095 --> 00:31:45.277]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:31:45.758 --> 00:31:46.758]  Silverlungs.com.
[00:31:51.362 --> 00:31:52.643]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:52.684 --> 00:31:58.008]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:31:58.269 --> 00:32:02.893]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:32:03.293 --> 00:32:08.318]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:32:08.838 --> 00:32:13.561]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:32:14.082 --> 00:32:16.003]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:32:16.383 --> 00:32:21.006]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:32:21.186 --> 00:32:22.087]  And here's the best part.
[00:32:22.307 --> 00:32:25.069]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:32:25.089 --> 00:32:28.992]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:32:29.012 --> 00:32:31.834]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:32:32.194 --> 00:32:34.075]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:32:34.415 --> 00:32:35.336]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:32:39.058 --> 00:32:42.680]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:32:43.201 --> 00:32:47.703]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:32:48.043 --> 00:32:50.125]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:12.529]  Want to remind listeners, we're now shipping Invisible Empire New Order Defined on DVD.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.522]  You can also support us by purchasing it.
[00:33:15.542 --> 00:33:16.883]  It's part of the win-win.
[00:33:16.903 --> 00:33:20.106]  Exposing the New World Order to the Global Corporate Fascist State.
[00:33:20.667 --> 00:33:21.748]  Two plus hour film.
[00:33:21.788 --> 00:33:22.989]  Jason Bermas, I produced it.
[00:33:23.629 --> 00:33:25.411]  Now available at Infowars.com.
[00:33:25.431 --> 00:33:29.215]  We have Police State, The Rise of FEMA coming out next week that I've made over the last year.
[00:33:29.735 --> 00:33:34.820]  Proving this police state control grid and that the FEMA camps do indeed exist.
[00:33:35.621 --> 00:33:38.463]  Going back to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:33:39.604 --> 00:33:46.986]  Separately on the police state, regardless of the Emergency Centers Act, regardless of the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, Patriot Act, we know U.S.
[00:33:47.006 --> 00:33:48.287]  citizens are being grabbed.
[00:33:48.867 --> 00:33:50.467]  The military is torturing them.
[00:33:50.848 --> 00:33:52.348]  They are holding them without trial.
[00:33:52.828 --> 00:33:53.868]  All of this is going on.
[00:33:53.928 --> 00:33:58.770]  The denial needs to end about the level of tyranny accelerating in our society.
[00:34:02.162 --> 00:34:11.873]  Well, Alex, I don't know how much of it goes on, but what we do know for certain is that they have removed the barriers to it and can do it whenever they want.
[00:34:13.796 --> 00:34:15.197]  They can grab whoever they want.
[00:34:15.558 --> 00:34:16.839]  We had, you know, the head of
[00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:32.966]  Homeland Security fairly recently saying that Homeland Security was shifting its attention from foreign terrorists to domestic American extremists and we had not long ago
[00:34:34.426 --> 00:34:38.787]  The arrest of a blonde, blue-eyed woman as a terrorist.
[00:34:39.588 --> 00:34:43.809]  So they're already moving away from the Muslim threat.
[00:34:44.849 --> 00:34:54.633]  They used that to get all of those police state measures in place, and now they can apply them to the general population.
[00:34:55.553 --> 00:35:01.315]  Alex, before we go off into that, let me say one more thing about the income tax.
[00:35:01.435 --> 00:35:02.015]  Absolutely.
[00:35:02.695 --> 00:35:12.622]  Many progressives and liberals get disturbed at criticisms of the income tax because they think it's used for the poor.
[00:35:13.462 --> 00:35:31.634]  I was on a show just the other day where the host thought that income tax paid for public schools and roads and was unaware that the road system was built with gasoline tax and that the public schools are funded with property tax.
[00:35:33.601 --> 00:35:39.264]  But let me just make a point about the use of the income tax revenues.
[00:35:41.146 --> 00:35:57.815]  Last week, David Lindorf published an article in which he said if you add up all of the military spending, not just the Pentagon's budget, but all of the other related military spending that's dispersed throughout the budget and other departments,
[00:35:58.777 --> 00:36:09.706]  The supplementals for the wars and the CIA and so forth, that it comes to 53% of the federal income tax revenues.
[00:36:10.807 --> 00:36:20.255]  So that more than half of the federal income tax revenues are used to fund the military.
[00:36:22.016 --> 00:36:23.858]  Now this is an extraordinary thing.
[00:36:25.774 --> 00:36:28.257]  I don't think it was this bad during the dark ages.
[00:36:29.258 --> 00:36:37.989]  But if you have the military function of the government, which has now 53% of the unserved labor
[00:36:41.684 --> 00:36:42.885]  goes to support.
[00:36:42.905 --> 00:36:45.127]  This is an extraordinary thing.
[00:36:46.048 --> 00:37:01.083]  And it gives the military security complex such power, because a lot of these funds are recycled into political campaign contributions, that it's almost impossible to budge this.
[00:37:02.952 --> 00:37:22.553]  Now if you look at the size of the American budget and military spending, the total thing that Lindor presents, and you add in that of all of our allies in Europe, Japan, and in the nations that are friendly to us, it accounts for two-thirds of world military spending.
[00:37:24.082 --> 00:37:26.603]  And so how do we face a threat?
[00:37:27.423 --> 00:37:28.923]  How is Iran a threat?
[00:37:28.964 --> 00:37:38.646]  Now this is really very interesting because Iran's annual military budget is 4.8 billion dollars.
[00:37:39.687 --> 00:37:44.808]  Cost of maybe, what, two weeks of our war in Afghanistan.
[00:37:44.828 --> 00:37:49.970]  4.8 billion is what the Pentagon spends on child care and recreation.
[00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:55.395]  It's what it spends on its replacement helicopters.
[00:37:55.815 --> 00:37:59.480]  Or one or two stealth bombers.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:08.792]  So here is Iran with a military budget equal to what the Pentagon spends on childcare and recreation, and it's a threat to America?
[00:38:10.259 --> 00:38:10.899]  It's amazing.
[00:38:11.039 --> 00:38:19.682]  Now, going back, you were Ronald Reagan's chief financial market advisor, the father of Reaganomics, head of policy at the Treasury.
[00:38:20.402 --> 00:38:21.662]  What about the Grace Commission?
[00:38:21.683 --> 00:38:28.224]  Because my reading of that, it boils down to not one red cent of it goes to the American people or to run the country.
[00:38:28.785 --> 00:38:32.826]  From my reading, much of the money goes to interest on the debt, does it not?
[00:38:34.261 --> 00:38:35.701]  Well, now.
[00:38:36.722 --> 00:38:45.564]  And one way they are keeping that down is the Federal Reserve is buying so much of the debt in order to hold down the interest rate.
[00:38:46.445 --> 00:38:53.927]  But the minute that blows up, which it has to sooner or later, the cost of carrying the debt is going to be horrific.
[00:38:55.007 --> 00:38:59.108]  You remember the short-term interest rates that Volcker stuck on? 17%?
[00:39:02.904 --> 00:39:09.347]  I can remember when long-term treasuries, when I went into the treasury, the interest rate on long-term treasuries was 16%.
[00:39:11.488 --> 00:39:14.009]  Can you imagine those kinds of interest rates today?
[00:39:14.029 --> 00:39:15.210]  Well, let me ask you that.
[00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:17.411]  They're now talking about raising interest rates.
[00:39:18.292 --> 00:39:19.412]  A, what will that do?
[00:39:19.832 --> 00:39:31.138]  And then B, we've got Volcker, Obama, and people like Glenn Beck calling for sales taxes, value-added taxes, carbon taxes, saying we've got to pay this.
[00:39:32.981 --> 00:39:40.528]  Well, the carbon tax, in my opinion, is something that Wall Street and corporations have cooked up.
[00:39:42.249 --> 00:39:48.475]  And the purpose of the carbon tax is to make pollution profitable.
[00:39:49.375 --> 00:39:56.201]  Because you can now buy and sell the right to pollute, and of course Wall Street will turn it into derivatives.
[00:39:56.261 --> 00:39:57.943]  Sure, but what will that do to the economy?
[00:40:01.225 --> 00:40:05.646]  I don't think that that is the threat to the economy.
[00:40:06.707 --> 00:40:20.070]  It may not help, but the threat is another unregulated, over-the-counter, derivative instrument in which pollution becomes profitable.
[00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:22.891]  So it doesn't help the environment.
[00:40:23.531 --> 00:40:24.651]  What does VAT do?
[00:40:26.714 --> 00:40:32.178]  VAT drives up the price of everything people buy.
[00:40:33.639 --> 00:40:36.561]  It's a very high sales tax.
[00:40:37.301 --> 00:40:39.202]  A federal sales tax.
[00:40:39.823 --> 00:40:46.627]  What it does is it taxes the value added to a product at every stage.
[00:40:46.747 --> 00:40:50.389]  So if we say, okay, we go dig up the iron ore.
[00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:57.579]  The act of digging the ore out of the ground, that makes it more valuable because it's now accessible.
[00:40:57.679 --> 00:41:05.190]  So the difference in the value of the ore in the ground and the value of the ore dug out, that difference is value added and it's taxed!
[00:41:06.092 --> 00:41:10.053]  And then the iron ore is converted into iron or steel.
[00:41:10.413 --> 00:41:13.894]  And that is another enhancement of value.
[00:41:13.934 --> 00:41:15.455]  And that value is taxed.
[00:41:15.495 --> 00:41:18.496]  And then the steel is converted into products.
[00:41:19.156 --> 00:41:21.797]  Cars, steel beams, whatever, sheet metal.
[00:41:22.237 --> 00:41:24.658]  Then it's packaged, then it's shipped, then it's sold.
[00:41:25.138 --> 00:41:27.218]  It's taxed at every level.
[00:41:28.359 --> 00:41:33.680]  And, you know, the value-added taxes in Europe are 20, 22 percent.
[00:41:34.041 --> 00:41:35.061]  They may be higher now.
[00:41:35.951 --> 00:41:41.192]  And so that then becomes an enormous sales tax.
[00:41:42.553 --> 00:41:44.613]  That's why cars cost so much in Europe.
[00:41:44.653 --> 00:41:53.936]  That's why washing machines and dryers and appliances and refrigerators and stoves, they all have this tax.
[00:41:54.316 --> 00:41:54.836]  And fuel!
[00:41:55.851 --> 00:41:56.451]  And fuel.
[00:41:56.912 --> 00:42:05.637]  So, it's a way of suppressing the purchasing power and living standards of the people.
[00:42:05.977 --> 00:42:12.001]  And then meanwhile, if China and India and others don't have a VAT, won't that drive the few industries we have left out of the country?
[00:42:12.921 --> 00:42:22.187]  Well, you see, the value added tax is rebated on exports.
[00:42:23.728 --> 00:42:25.389]  But it's applied to imports.
[00:42:26.866 --> 00:42:35.290]  So, a country that has a value-added tax in a trade situation has an advantage over one that doesn't.
[00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:44.155]  Because when Europe exports these products to us, they rebate that tax.
[00:42:44.235 --> 00:42:47.977]  But we don't have any industry really left, as you've said, so that isn't good.
[00:42:48.977 --> 00:42:50.118]  And we don't have
[00:42:52.658 --> 00:42:57.500]  All right.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:13.486]  Doctor, I want to move quickly through some other subjects, but going back to overall taxes, because you wanted to come on today and we're honored to have you.
[00:43:13.786 --> 00:43:17.108]  Specifically, other points you'd like to make about the income tax that I want to ask you.
[00:43:17.828 --> 00:43:19.309]  Where do you see all this leading?
[00:43:19.389 --> 00:43:23.693]  Because, I mean, clearly this is a vertical integration, a criminal consolidation.
[00:43:23.753 --> 00:43:27.836]  They have no appearances of even slowing down, only accelerating.
[00:43:28.456 --> 00:43:29.777]  How do you see this unfolding?
[00:43:31.578 --> 00:43:40.065]  Well, the people and the vast majority of Americans will find a sharp decline in their living standard.
[00:43:41.801 --> 00:44:01.287]  And there's no way around it, because not only are the jobs, the best jobs, disappearing, but all of these taxes will, particularly value-added tax, will seriously reduce their purchasing power.
[00:44:01.327 --> 00:44:09.510]  If you had a 20% value-added tax, for example, it means that 20% of your purchases that you currently have are wiped out.
[00:44:11.658 --> 00:44:14.920]  And so you see a 20% reduction in your real income.
[00:44:16.241 --> 00:44:16.781]  Expanding.
[00:44:17.521 --> 00:44:18.402]  Expanding on that.
[00:44:20.143 --> 00:44:26.846]  The trick again is they've had fake conservatives promoting VAT for almost two decades, saying we're going to get rid of the income tax.
[00:44:26.886 --> 00:44:31.069]  But now they're saying, oh no, we're going to have the income tax and the VAT, but don't worry, it'll only be 2%.
[00:44:31.749 --> 00:44:33.630]  Well, that's how the federal income tax started.
[00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:34.411]  Right.
[00:44:34.611 --> 00:44:35.091]  That's right.
[00:44:35.551 --> 00:44:40.014]  You know, as we said earlier in your program today, the reason the
[00:44:40.916 --> 00:44:54.642]  Income Tax Amendment passed, the Constitutional Amendment, meanwhile, was that the vast majority of states didn't have anybody living in them that had income higher enough to be taxed under the original proposal.
[00:44:55.422 --> 00:44:58.984]  So sure, once you have... But the same thing happened with state sales taxes.
[00:44:59.084 --> 00:45:01.185]  I can remember when the first sales tax was 1%.
[00:45:04.146 --> 00:45:04.866]  What are they now?
[00:45:04.886 --> 00:45:04.866]  6, 7, 8...
[00:45:07.327 --> 00:45:11.588]  So, if it's a 2% value-added tax, it won't be 2% very long.
[00:45:11.608 --> 00:45:15.909]  It'll very quickly rise up, as in Europe.
[00:45:16.029 --> 00:45:19.089]  They're now, as I said, they're at 20% or more.
[00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:27.651]  Now, where all this may end is that the dollar may simply collapse.
[00:45:28.411 --> 00:45:30.652]  It may lose its reserve currency role.
[00:45:32.032 --> 00:45:39.366]  In which case, it will be the end of the evil empire because the wars won't be, you can't finance them.
[00:45:40.418 --> 00:45:51.044]  The only way they can finance all of these wars and all of this military spending is that the dollar is a reserve currency and we can pay our bills simply by printing money.
[00:45:51.124 --> 00:45:52.445]  Nobody else can do that.
[00:45:52.465 --> 00:46:08.535]  So if we lose that role, then you will see a collapse in the empire and you will also see a collapse in living standards because it would have a similar effect as a value-added tax in reducing people's incomes.
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:18.828]  Because the value of it would fall dramatically, and so all of the imports on which we are dependent would rise in price.
[00:46:19.088 --> 00:46:23.371]  And this would also have the effect of reducing Americans' real incomes.
[00:46:23.872 --> 00:46:31.257]  So for the future, Alex, it's going to be different than the past when people could look forward to a rising level of income.
[00:46:31.718 --> 00:46:32.819]  Now, I'm afraid.
[00:46:33.439 --> 00:46:36.782]  They'll have to look forward to declining levels of real income.
[00:46:37.543 --> 00:46:40.606]  I want to take a few calls here in the end of this segment and the next with you.
[00:46:40.646 --> 00:46:42.287]  We really appreciate you spending time with us.
[00:46:43.228 --> 00:46:49.494]  But, you know, we know there's some global organization of this, but it's driven by the greed, the short term view.
[00:46:49.854 --> 00:46:50.434]  But at the U.N.
[00:46:50.474 --> 00:46:51.796]  level, it's a long term view.
[00:46:52.316 --> 00:46:57.381]  But it lends credence to what you're saying, that it's just a bunch of looters and not organized
[00:46:58.001 --> 00:46:58.682]  At some point.
[00:46:59.163 --> 00:47:06.432]  Because I'm reading in Texas and in Ohio and in Michigan and New Jersey and all over, more than 10 states going bankrupt or on the verge.
[00:47:06.912 --> 00:47:10.136]  Some sheriffs and police departments slashing by more than half.
[00:47:10.917 --> 00:47:13.400]  Police saying buy your own guns to protect yourself.
[00:47:14.381 --> 00:47:30.498]  As taxes go up, more and more goes to interest on the debt and to corporate welfare and actual road warrior type scenarios where one county in Ohio that has over 100,000 people will have one cop on duty for every shift from 116 that they had.
[00:47:30.538 --> 00:47:34.743]  I mean this, we're looking at potential road warrior type collapse.
[00:47:36.821 --> 00:47:38.102]  Um, could be.
[00:47:38.682 --> 00:47:39.222]  It could be.
[00:47:39.242 --> 00:47:47.527]  I think most likely, though, the last thing government will let go of are the forces that protect them.
[00:47:48.728 --> 00:47:53.131]  And the notion that the police protect the public is probably not correct.
[00:47:53.191 --> 00:47:55.012]  The police protect the government.
[00:47:57.339 --> 00:48:01.447]  If you think the FBI protects you, you're wrong.
[00:48:02.489 --> 00:48:08.680]  Just like the military doesn't protect the people, it protects the government that pays its salary.
[00:48:09.921 --> 00:48:23.244]  So I'm not sure that a lot of the gang activity won't come from police because they're an organized armed force.
[00:48:24.405 --> 00:48:26.765]  And the people are not organized.
[00:48:26.785 --> 00:48:28.086]  That's a key point.
[00:48:28.446 --> 00:48:29.446]  They said in Ohio...
[00:48:30.126 --> 00:48:37.832]  They were going to keep 49 of the 116 deputies and that now only one would be on patrol for the citizens, the rest out collecting revenue.
[00:48:37.852 --> 00:48:41.836]  So now they're admitting, we're here to collect revenue, we're not going to protect you.
[00:48:41.856 --> 00:48:42.737]  They actually say that.
[00:48:44.278 --> 00:48:44.818]  That's right.
[00:48:44.978 --> 00:48:50.463]  And you know, they can collect revenues in a different way than taxes and just shake you down.
[00:48:51.704 --> 00:48:58.449]  So who knows, Alex, we don't need to get this far into it.
[00:48:59.355 --> 00:49:12.637]  We can't predict what the behavior will be that closely, but we do know that the kinds of restraints that restrain government power are being removed.
[00:49:13.037 --> 00:49:13.317]  Yes.
[00:49:14.138 --> 00:49:27.600]  And we do know that the sort of economy we had that produced rising consumer incomes is being dismantled and that the more likely prospect is falling.
[00:49:28.479 --> 00:49:29.460]  Consumer income.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:37.565]  So you get a mixture of a weaker, poor public and a stronger, less accountable government.
[00:49:38.766 --> 00:49:43.889]  And that, that is enough to make us disturbed.
[00:49:45.027 --> 00:49:45.908]  Absolutely.
[00:49:46.588 --> 00:49:48.429]  This is the latest book I've written.
[00:50:10.001 --> 00:50:18.910]  And a lot of people who get motivated to try to learn something about economics, they get a book and they try to read it and they can't.
[00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:20.211]  It's full of jargon.
[00:50:20.391 --> 00:50:21.552]  It's got equations.
[00:50:21.693 --> 00:50:22.413]  It's dense.
[00:50:23.154 --> 00:50:27.798]  This book is written like a column for a newspaper.
[00:50:29.059 --> 00:50:30.681]  And people can follow.
[00:50:31.402 --> 00:50:36.249]  You're a great writer, and we've got the book holding it up on TV ourselves, How the Economy Was Lost.
[00:50:36.289 --> 00:50:38.272]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, I promise to take calls.
[00:50:38.672 --> 00:50:39.493]  We're almost out of time.

[00:50:40.455 --> 00:50:43.579]  Quick questions from our callers for Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:50:43.599 --> 00:50:44.120]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:52.513 --> 00:50:54.174]  Oh, my sinuses!

[00:52:53.457 --> 00:52:58.798]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:52:59.058 --> 00:53:03.679]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:53:04.079 --> 00:53:09.140]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:14.321]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:53:14.861 --> 00:53:21.786]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:53:21.986 --> 00:53:22.886]  And here's the best part.
[00:53:23.107 --> 00:53:29.471]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[00:53:36.135 --> 00:53:36.315]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:53:36.335 --> 00:53:36.576]  Remember,
[00:53:44.921 --> 00:53:48.504]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:53:48.824 --> 00:53:51.286]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:57.791]  Alright, Lord Christopher Monk is coming up.
[00:53:57.811 --> 00:53:59.853]  For those of you that are holding, you'll get to talk to him.
[00:54:00.514 --> 00:54:02.235]  We're just not going to hang up on the callers.
[00:54:02.275 --> 00:54:03.336]  I should have gone to your calls.
[00:54:03.396 --> 00:54:04.577]  Roberts has so much knowledge.
[00:54:04.637 --> 00:54:05.578]  I have so many questions.
[00:54:06.358 --> 00:54:07.419]  Jamming in a few calls.
[00:54:07.499 --> 00:54:10.402]  Jim in Missouri, you're on the air with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:54:11.522 --> 00:54:12.263]  Hey, Mr. Roberts.
[00:54:13.857 --> 00:54:15.358]  I mean, it's really nice to talk to you.
[00:54:15.658 --> 00:54:26.343]  You've got a lot of experience on, you know, taxes and everything else, and where you came from in life as far as all the information that's been provided to you.
[00:54:26.363 --> 00:54:40.171]  I guess my question to you would be, in all of your research, what would the average individual, knowing... Okay, so they read your books and follow some... Now, what do we do about this?
[00:54:40.211 --> 00:54:40.851]  Is that the question?
[00:54:41.531 --> 00:54:41.991]  Well, yeah.
[00:54:43.797 --> 00:54:47.361]  The average individual is just going to take this as a grain of salt.
[00:54:47.541 --> 00:54:52.226]  They don't have no direction to counter-direct the government.
[00:54:53.548 --> 00:55:02.577]  So I guess my question to you is, if you were able to provide some sort of a movement, how would you... I understand the question.
[00:55:02.597 --> 00:55:03.258]  Thank you, Jim.
[00:55:03.378 --> 00:55:05.280]  I mean, what do we do about this, Dr. Roberts?
[00:55:06.761 --> 00:55:12.542]  Well, we may not be able to do anything about it until it just falls apart.
[00:55:13.603 --> 00:55:21.565]  Though, you know, last week in one of the stands, part of the former Soviet empire was in Kyrgyzstan.
[00:55:22.545 --> 00:55:26.426]  All of a sudden, the people just revolted and threw the government out.
[00:55:27.246 --> 00:55:32.687]  And they did this despite being fired on by troops.
[00:55:36.651 --> 00:55:45.459]  At some point, maybe people will have nothing left to lose and will revolt.
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:59.231]  The only other solution is a long-term solution of restoring veneration of the Constitution so that people say that's what's important is protecting the Constitution.
[00:55:59.271 --> 00:56:01.233]  We can't do anything that undermines
[00:56:01.813 --> 00:56:04.855]  The Constitution or the restraints that it places on government.
[00:56:04.875 --> 00:56:06.156]  But that would take a long time.
[00:56:06.196 --> 00:56:08.578]  The law schools would have to have a change of mind.
[00:56:08.618 --> 00:56:11.680]  They would have to teach a generation of law students.
[00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:17.444]  They would have to enter into the judiciary, especially the federal judiciary.
[00:56:19.045 --> 00:56:21.246]  The bar associations would have to change.
[00:56:21.346 --> 00:56:24.128]  Instead, the criminals have gotten in and brought in all their people.
[00:56:24.168 --> 00:56:26.089]  But I agree, we need to put out the message.
[00:56:26.109 --> 00:56:26.470]  Gangsters.
[00:56:26.770 --> 00:56:27.530]  Yeah, gangsters.
[00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:28.511]  Looting, gangsters.
[00:56:28.531 --> 00:56:30.953]  We have a government of looters.
[00:56:32.074 --> 00:56:32.574]  Possibly.
[00:56:32.995 --> 00:56:38.482]  Or we have a government rather, controlled by organized looting groups.
[00:56:39.123 --> 00:56:44.410]  The big offshoring corporations, Wall Street, these are all gangster operations.
[00:56:45.848 --> 00:56:48.450]  Well, absolutely, by every yardstick, by every measurement.
[00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:58.580]  But I think it's important also just to point out their criminals and give people the alternative of the Republic, of the Bill of Rights, of the Constitution, so that people can recognize this tyranny and counter.
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:07.968]  I mean, I'm sure you saw the Wall Street Journal, where they admit that NBC and others have propaganda placement or behavior placement in the shows, brainwashing people with federal funds.
[00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:20.066]  That's right, and of course the federal government pays people to go onto internet sites and try to discredit anybody that speaks truth.
[00:57:21.246 --> 00:57:24.628]  The State Department does this, and it's also used worldwide.
[00:57:24.689 --> 00:57:28.731]  They use it to try to destabilize governments that aren't American puppets.
[00:57:29.511 --> 00:57:38.157]  So there's a tremendous use of propaganda, and it's very difficult for American people to ever get a firm grasp.
[00:57:38.997 --> 00:57:40.558]  on what the real situation is.
[00:57:40.578 --> 00:57:46.400]  They're too busy trying to have a living, pay their rent, hold on to their home, or whatever.
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:47.761]  Doc, we're out of time.
[00:57:47.821 --> 00:57:56.865]  I appreciate the hour on Tax Day, and I know you're about to take some time off, and hopefully you'll be back doing talk radio in the future, how the economy was lost, the war of the worlds.
[00:57:57.185 --> 00:57:59.006]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, here's the book.
[00:57:59.426 --> 00:58:01.407]  Dr. Roberts, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[00:58:02.007 --> 00:58:03.868]  Well, thank you for sharing your audience, Alex.
[00:58:04.508 --> 00:58:04.808]  You bet.
[00:58:04.848 --> 00:58:05.409]  God bless you.
[00:58:05.449 --> 00:58:06.569]  Have a good weekend coming up.
[00:58:07.570 --> 00:58:09.791]  Lord Christopher Monckton coming up on a host of issues.
[00:58:09.831 --> 00:58:12.312]  He's hosting one of the big tea parties in D.C.
[00:58:12.752 --> 00:58:16.214]  Don't forget, we've got two new films launching this week and next week.

[01:00:39.138 --> 01:00:41.100]  He'll give us the location, the time, the place.
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:42.481]  Then we're going to chronicle
[01:00:43.542 --> 01:00:49.047]  All the new information that dwarfs Climategate and the whitewash in England by the government.
[01:00:50.809 --> 01:00:53.432]  I mean, just absolutely outrageous.
[01:00:53.452 --> 01:01:03.381]  And where the UN and others are going with their push in Mexico City to try to set up this world government.
[01:01:03.661 --> 01:01:05.303]  Lord Monckton, great to have you on with us, sir.
[01:01:06.254 --> 01:01:12.337]  It's a real joy to be with you once again and God bless everyone who's listening and on tax day, God bless America.
[01:01:12.357 --> 01:01:13.497]  You need all the help you can get.
[01:01:15.238 --> 01:01:15.698]  I hear you.
[01:01:15.738 --> 01:01:17.839]  Our taxes are getting as high as France almost.
[01:01:18.759 --> 01:01:20.400]  First off, tell us about the event today.
[01:01:21.308 --> 01:01:31.194]  Well, the event today, of course, is the culmination of the great Tea Party Express that began in Searchlight, Arizona, which is Harry Reid's seat, as you know, with Sarah Palin kicking things off.
[01:01:31.494 --> 01:01:43.061]  She was in Boston yesterday and was getting huge tears from the crowd when she said, I want to tell my left-wing friends this, that conservative women are hotter.
[01:01:43.622 --> 01:01:45.323]  Well, I've got one more thing to add to that.
[01:01:45.383 --> 01:01:48.765]  Conservative guys are hotter, too, especially if they have a British accent.
[01:01:49.145 --> 01:01:53.171]  Anyway, it's now made all its way through to Washington D.C.
[01:01:53.611 --> 01:02:03.345]  where the final rally takes place on Tax Day this evening, East Coast time, between kind of 5 p.m.
[01:02:03.405 --> 01:02:04.026]  and 10 p.m.
[01:02:06.321 --> 01:02:17.331]  At the Washington Monument, which, for those of you who haven't been here before, is an enormous needle of marble, the largest freestanding marble structure in the world.
[01:02:17.971 --> 01:02:26.979]  And it's right there, opposite the White House, where we are told that Barack Hussein Obama will probably be cowering behind the drapes in the Oval Office.
[01:02:27.619 --> 01:02:30.540]  Yes, it's a giant, I guess, ziggurat or obelisk.
[01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:33.781]  You can't miss it with its aluminum capstone.
[01:02:34.482 --> 01:02:51.708]  Lord Monckton, we're about to go to break, but there's so much happening, I've got all my questions, but what is most important on your battle board as you look at the whole array of our forces growing, the enemy's forces vanquished on many levels, but regrouping like serpents?
[01:02:52.455 --> 01:03:03.899]  Well of course they still intend to take democracy and freedom away forever and President Obama and the administration will do everything they can to make sure that the UN
[01:03:04.383 --> 01:03:16.648]  The Green Global Government is cemented into place so that your constitution will no longer matter and so that freedom, democracy, prosperity will be gone forever.
[01:03:17.069 --> 01:03:33.736]  When I went to Bonn recently for the UN conference to plan for the next conference, which as you rightly mentioned is in Cancun in Mexico, this December, the follow on from the collapsed Copenhagen conference last December, they were still issuing
[01:03:34.258 --> 01:04:01.086]  Copies of a September the 15th draft of the Copenhagen Treaty, the draft that didn't make it to Copenhagen, which lays out in 186 pages the program for a world government with powers to suspend and control and set the rules of all formerly free markets, which would of course disappear, the powers of enormous taxation, and you know, you really can't take much more taxes than you've already got here in the United States.
[01:04:01.773 --> 01:04:13.375]  And then also powers of intervention in not only the environmental but the economic affairs of all nations directly over the heads of their elected representatives.
[01:04:13.715 --> 01:04:16.316]  And of course, will this world government be elected?
[01:04:16.376 --> 01:04:27.118]  Does the word election, democracy, ballot or vote or any such word occur anywhere in the 186 pages of this blueprint for the end of democracy worldwide?
[01:04:27.418 --> 01:04:29.458]  No, of course it does not.
[01:04:29.818 --> 01:04:32.040]  Lord Monckton, we're going to come right back with a long segment.
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:50.894]  Break down the enemy blueprints that time and time again, by the grace of God and good spies, continue to fall into our hands on a weekly basis and all the new scandals absolutely proving systematic organized fraud by the collectivist parasites to push their green new world order.
[01:04:55.819 --> 01:04:56.720]  Tyranny is here.
[01:04:57.081 --> 01:05:00.805]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:05:01.025 --> 01:05:03.247]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:05:03.267 --> 01:05:08.713]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:05:09.133 --> 01:05:15.360]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:21.362]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:05:21.762 --> 01:05:25.443]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:05:25.943 --> 01:05:29.905]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:05:30.225 --> 01:05:36.147]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:05:36.167 --> 01:05:39.308]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:05:39.728 --> 01:05:41.149]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:05:41.689 --> 01:05:42.129]  It's here.

[01:05:52.093 --> 01:05:54.694]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:05:55.114 --> 01:06:00.075]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:06:00.436 --> 01:06:02.176]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:06:02.476 --> 01:06:07.278]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:06:07.478 --> 01:06:08.439]  How much do you want?
[01:06:08.659 --> 01:06:09.399]  When do you want it?
[01:06:09.779 --> 01:06:11.381]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:06:11.662 --> 01:06:12.483]  When will you need it?
[01:06:12.743 --> 01:06:14.806]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:06:14.946 --> 01:06:16.048]  Will there be any food?
[01:06:16.288 --> 01:06:17.610]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:06:17.810 --> 01:06:22.877]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:06:23.077 --> 01:06:26.202]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:06:26.642 --> 01:06:30.144]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:06:30.465 --> 01:06:31.445]  How much will you need?
[01:06:31.685 --> 01:06:32.326]  We don't know.
[01:06:32.606 --> 01:06:33.507]  How much do you want?
[01:06:33.707 --> 01:06:34.447]  All you can get.
[01:06:34.627 --> 01:06:35.488]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:35.728 --> 01:06:38.490]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:06:38.770 --> 01:06:41.412]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:41.632 --> 01:06:42.393]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:06:51.348 --> 01:06:52.329]  What's your home worth?
[01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:54.430]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:06:54.631 --> 01:06:57.373]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[01:06:57.673 --> 01:07:05.179]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[01:07:05.379 --> 01:07:08.821]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.
[01:07:09.041 --> 01:07:11.183]  It's so easy, and best of all, it's free.

[01:07:35.515 --> 01:07:38.577]  See the top 12 home improvements right now at HomeGain.com.
[01:07:38.677 --> 01:07:41.418]  That's H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com.
[01:07:41.638 --> 01:07:49.766]  Look for Max, the Orange Home Gain Gorilla, to help you find a realtor or with any other real estate needs you might have at HomeGain.com, your real estate connection.
[01:07:49.786 --> 01:07:58.115]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:06.559 --> 01:08:22.243]  Lord Christopher Monckton is our guest, probably the leading crusader, with the most accurate information of the last 15 plus years, fighting the Green New World Order, as the UN calls it, in its internal documents.
[01:08:22.263 --> 01:08:29.805]  For those that just joined us, Lord Monckton is in Washington today for a huge Tea Party event starting 5pm to 10pm in front of the Washington Monument.
[01:08:29.825 --> 01:08:30.726]  You cannot miss it.
[01:08:31.086 --> 01:08:35.507]  Sir, flesh this out, because, I mean, walk through this world government they're setting up,
[01:08:36.007 --> 01:08:48.395]  These incredible documents that continue to get leaked and declassified and stolen by some that are being put out, I mean, really gives us a picture and lets us know there's no longer any denial.
[01:08:48.755 --> 01:08:52.297]  This is open global tyranny and we now have the head of the Gaia movement
[01:08:52.877 --> 01:09:01.761]  Over in England last week and the London Guardian calling for a global dictatorship saying we can't have freedom, the people are quote too stupid, we must have rationing.
[01:09:02.061 --> 01:09:04.282]  I mean these are open tyrants.
[01:09:04.702 --> 01:09:13.446]  Even Hitler and the communists and other despots were not this open selling tyranny as if it's mother's milk.
[01:09:14.537 --> 01:09:15.699]  That's a wonderful phrase.
[01:09:15.799 --> 01:09:17.964]  Selling tyranny as if it's mother's milk.
[01:09:18.224 --> 01:09:19.286]  I must remember that one.
[01:09:20.068 --> 01:09:21.771]  That'll do well in speeches, I think.
[01:09:22.372 --> 01:09:23.454]  I think you're quite right.
[01:09:23.714 --> 01:09:27.161]  There is an extraordinary failure of will.
[01:09:28.479 --> 01:09:37.781]  On the part of the peoples of formerly democratic nations like Britain, for instance, which now lives under the dictatorship of the European Commissars.
[01:09:37.841 --> 01:09:48.302]  And, of course, it's therefore very easy now for people like the leader of the Gaia Movement to come out and say, we want dictatorship because, of course, we've already got dictatorship in Europe.
[01:09:48.802 --> 01:09:53.203]  And we've already got cap and tax because, hey, we weren't asked about it.
[01:09:53.483 --> 01:09:55.224]  None of our legislators were asked about it.
[01:09:55.324 --> 01:09:57.864]  It was imposed by the European dictatorship.
[01:09:58.211 --> 01:10:00.612]  And we all had to salute and obey.
[01:10:01.293 --> 01:10:02.913]  And we had no say in the matter.
[01:10:03.294 --> 01:10:16.680]  Now, the great thing about the United States of America, and I'm speaking here in Washington, D.C., on Tax Day, is that the United States is different, because it has a Constitution.
[01:10:17.441 --> 01:10:22.503]  And the Constitution, at Article 1, Section 1, says this.
[01:10:23.043 --> 01:10:23.344]  It says,
[01:10:24.344 --> 01:10:33.753]  Legislative power herein granted shall be vested in the Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives, full point.
[01:10:34.694 --> 01:10:45.103]  Now, that means there is no dictatorship here for as long as the people of the United States are willing to keep themselves free.
[01:10:45.644 --> 01:10:48.887]  And that, I think, is the significance of the Tea Party movement
[01:10:49.286 --> 01:10:52.428]  Which came from nowhere a little over a year ago.
[01:10:52.448 --> 01:10:56.932]  The grassroots suddenly decided they were going to stand up and be counted.
[01:10:57.452 --> 01:11:11.763]  And I know that President Obama and the other world government wannabes are saying that this is astroturf that is paid for by fossil fuel industries or other wicked evil capitalists who want to keep the world free and prosperous.
[01:11:12.143 --> 01:11:17.667]  But, the fact is, this is a stirring of popular opinion.
[01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:31.626]  Such as has probably not been seen in the United States since that day in 1773 when your forefathers decided to pour tea into Boston Harbor.
[01:11:31.906 --> 01:11:33.106]  Now I've got a tip for you.
[01:11:33.387 --> 01:11:35.667]  Try pouring it into the teapot next time.
[01:11:35.948 --> 01:11:37.848]  It tastes better that way.
[01:11:38.109 --> 01:11:40.009]  But remember this also.
[01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:43.751]  The British tea tax was thousands of times cheaper
[01:11:44.235 --> 01:11:45.316]  Thank you very much.
[01:12:00.905 --> 01:12:05.967]  And Obama, Obama is separately saying he's going to have the EPA enforce it regardless.
[01:12:06.307 --> 01:12:07.548]  That is open tyranny.
[01:12:07.568 --> 01:12:21.914]  And Club of Rome behind eco-fascist purge to criminalize climate skepticism, an article at PrisonPlanet.com quoting Club of Rome members saying we should all be arrested if we criticize anthropogenic global warming.
[01:12:21.994 --> 01:12:23.375]  I mean, they are openly
[01:12:24.016 --> 01:12:34.258]  Saying, arrest us, they've called for your arrest previously, when in truth they're the ones that have been caught committing this fraud and these crimes and you called for Al Gore to be arrested.
[01:12:35.069 --> 01:12:35.710]  Yes, indeed.
[01:12:36.010 --> 01:12:55.041]  I think the real criminals who are, I call them the global warming profiteers, and in Al Gore's case, the racketeers, where he is now ignoring the order of a High Court judge in the United Kingdom that found nine serious errors, I should say, in his mawkish sci-fi comedy horror movie.
[01:12:55.682 --> 01:12:57.243]  He deserves to go to jail.
[01:12:57.643 --> 01:13:17.750]  For peddling a false prospectus in his investment management corporation, which is devoted to so-called green investments, all of which are of course collapsing as the world fails to warm up anything light as fast as the UN and its fellow travellers of the climate extremist movement have predicted.
[01:13:18.330 --> 01:13:25.993]  But this idea that we should be arrested simply for saying what we believe to be the scientific
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:36.205]  That is the same sort of noise that Hitler and his supporters made in the early 1930s before Hitler was swept to power.
[01:13:36.705 --> 01:13:44.249]  The idea was that if everybody else could be silenced, then only one point of view would be allowed to be put.
[01:13:44.589 --> 01:13:46.510]  And that's what they're trying to do now.
[01:13:46.730 --> 01:13:47.210]  And why is this?
[01:13:47.931 --> 01:13:51.933]  It's actually not because they think they're going to get away with it.
[01:13:51.953 --> 01:13:54.474]  It's because they think they're not going to get away with it.
[01:13:55.117 --> 01:13:58.078]  They are now becoming desperate.
[01:13:58.578 --> 01:14:17.422]  Opinion polls in those countries where there is still freedom via the ballot box to decide your policies, and that means not Britain, not the dismal European dictatorship, but it does mean Canada, it does mean Australia, above all it does mean the United States of America.
[01:14:17.742 --> 01:14:20.443]  In those countries, each new opinion poll
[01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:29.677]  It says that people are believing less and less in this extremist nonsense coming up by the climate extremists.
[01:14:29.977 --> 01:14:31.298]  They no longer believe it.
[01:14:31.559 --> 01:14:33.360]  They're no longer prepared to vote for it.
[01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:35.302]  They're no longer prepared to pay for it.
[01:14:35.582 --> 01:14:36.683]  They do not want it.
[01:14:37.083 --> 01:14:44.049]  And the global warming profiteers are in desperation trying to call for the final solution.
[01:14:44.750 --> 01:15:00.142]  To silence the likes of me, who dare to raise elementary questions like the one I'm going to raise now, which is, how much global warming will a given increase in carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere cause?
[01:15:00.402 --> 01:15:07.108]  The answer, in today's atmosphere, we now know, by measurement, very, very, very little.
[01:15:07.588 --> 01:15:12.392]  It will cause some, but only about a quarter, a fifth, maybe even a seventh or a tenth.
[01:15:13.218 --> 01:15:20.441]  Of the UN's central estimate, and therefore that is harmless and tiny and beneficial.
[01:15:20.461 --> 01:15:27.944]  In fact, if we could double the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, the yield of some staple crops would go up by as much as 40%.
[01:15:28.064 --> 01:15:41.709]  CO2 is actually good for you, it's not harmful, but the reason why they want to stamp it out is that if they can pretend it's dangerous, it gives them the excuse to interfere and control every aspect
[01:15:42.452 --> 01:15:43.173]  And selectively?
[01:15:59.036 --> 01:15:59.737]  Absolutely.
[01:16:00.037 --> 01:16:03.159]  Here on that point, as you say, they're getting desperate.
[01:16:03.179 --> 01:16:08.162]  We're gaining, in an index of polls, as much as 2-3 points per week.
[01:16:08.942 --> 01:16:22.111]  Just in the last few months, the exposure of these criminals, these control freaks, trying to seize our society through false guilt and fear-mongering, apocalyptic doom,
[01:16:23.652 --> 01:16:27.133]  He is being exposed, but as you said, they're getting even more vicious.
[01:16:27.293 --> 01:16:33.676]  Everywhere Al Gore goes, he's now hounded about the Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets exploding in size.
[01:16:33.996 --> 01:16:40.158]  He's being hounded about 10 years of temperature going down, 15 of it slowing.
[01:16:41.679 --> 01:16:48.362]  Everywhere he goes, crowds are chasing him and trampling him basically politically down into the dirt.
[01:16:49.022 --> 01:16:51.463]  So how do you see them counter-striking?
[01:16:52.401 --> 01:16:57.204]  I think as far as Gore is concerned, he's a very sad, lonely figure now.
[01:16:57.544 --> 01:17:05.909]  He was the darling of the hour in 2007 when he got his Mickey Mouse Nobel Prize for Peace.
[01:17:06.970 --> 01:17:14.574]  He was the darling when he got his Mickey Mouse Oscar for the best sci-fi comedy horror movie.
[01:17:14.915 --> 01:17:16.836]  Everybody thought he was just a bee's knee.
[01:17:17.436 --> 01:17:32.843]  Now that they've realised that just about everything he's said is false from top to bottom, the British High Court saying that the Armageddon scenario that he depicted is not based on any scientific view, he is now
[01:17:33.763 --> 01:17:48.196]  Oh, well, of course, he's made a few hundred million in the meantime, so he'll be all right in his retirement in his Tennessee mansion, which consumes 20 times as much electricity and emits 20 times the carbon footprint of any average house in the United States.
[01:17:48.989 --> 01:17:52.170]  He's fine, but he's now an irrelevant.
[01:17:52.250 --> 01:18:01.932]  And I think the way we're going to take it back is starting with the tax day rallies all over the United States today, and especially the one here in Washington.
[01:18:02.492 --> 01:18:16.316]  We are going to put those in Congress who have drifted along with this garbage on notice that if any of them ever again vote for anything to do with global warming,
[01:18:16.826 --> 01:18:19.688]  They will be flung out of office forever.
[01:18:20.309 --> 01:18:22.170]  In the present state of the U.S.
[01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:40.065]  economy, where the debt from the year dot to the year 2004 was, I think, $4 trillion, it's now $14 trillion, and Obama has managed to add another $4 trillion in just the last six months.
[01:18:41.290 --> 01:19:00.508]  That kind of flagrant overspending, if he now proposes to increase that overspending still further with all this global warming rubbish, then I think the ordinary taxpayer, the ordinary working guy who might have made the mistake of voting for what I am going to call what it is, a communist administration,
[01:19:00.988 --> 01:19:06.290]  We'll stay there, Lord Monckton.
[01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:13.053]  We've got to go to break.
[01:19:13.093 --> 01:19:15.074]  We're going to come back and we'll go over that.
[01:19:15.094 --> 01:19:20.276]  Then we'll talk about all the new scandals filling in other pieces of the puzzle clearly in 2020 vision.
[01:19:21.676 --> 01:19:32.958]  Showing massive organized racketeering and what type of criminal action, what type of criminal charges need to be launched to bring these scallywags to justice.
[01:19:33.418 --> 01:19:38.699]  Scienceandpublicpolicy.org is the website of Lord Monckton.
[01:19:38.879 --> 01:19:42.580]  Excellent information there, an invaluable research and education tool.
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:46.040]  We'll put it up on screen during the break here at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:48.541]  And for radio listeners, it's linked up on our websites.
[01:19:48.781 --> 01:19:49.601]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:49.621 --> 01:19:50.061]  Stay with us.
[01:19:52.082 --> 01:19:55.263]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:19:55.623 --> 01:19:57.463]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:19:57.903 --> 01:19:58.323]  Don't!
[01:19:58.783 --> 01:20:01.804]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:20:02.224 --> 01:20:09.346]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[01:20:09.326 --> 01:20:10.986]  's number one debt secret.
[01:20:11.306 --> 01:20:14.967]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[01:20:15.367 --> 01:20:18.090]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[01:20:18.110 --> 01:20:25.559]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:26.881]  Herb K was right.
[01:20:27.081 --> 01:20:30.125]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:20:30.285 --> 01:20:31.306]  What have you got to lose?
[01:20:31.706 --> 01:20:32.687]  Stop the calls now!
[01:20:32.987 --> 01:20:34.688]  Get out of debt and have more money!
[01:20:35.009 --> 01:20:35.669]  Get Herb K.'
[01:20:35.569 --> 01:20:38.091]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now!
[01:20:38.231 --> 01:20:38.591]  Call 800-822-1291.
[01:20:38.891 --> 01:20:39.412]  That's 800-822-1291.
[01:20:39.432 --> 01:20:39.472]  800-822-1291.
[01:20:51.872 --> 01:20:58.094]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:20:58.554 --> 01:21:06.317]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:21:06.657 --> 01:21:14.539]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:21:14.819 --> 01:21:19.581]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:21:19.921 --> 01:21:24.605]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:21:25.145 --> 01:21:28.988]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:21:29.489 --> 01:21:30.509]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:30.569 --> 01:21:34.673]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:21:35.093 --> 01:21:39.456]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:21:39.977 --> 01:21:42.499]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:21:42.959 --> 01:21:45.540]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:48.160]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:53.742]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:21:53.762 --> 01:21:55.963]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:21:55.983 --> 01:21:58.923]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:21:59.303 --> 01:22:04.065]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:22:04.405 --> 01:22:08.606]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:22:08.906 --> 01:22:11.247]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:22:11.267 --> 01:22:13.789]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:22:13.809 --> 01:22:16.710]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:22:17.051 --> 01:22:24.655]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:22:24.995 --> 01:22:30.319]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:22:30.379 --> 01:22:32.681]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:22:32.701 --> 01:22:36.685]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:22:36.925 --> 01:22:37.825]  And I got news for you.
[01:22:38.006 --> 01:22:39.327]  You're everyone else.
[01:22:39.347 --> 01:22:40.387]  Invisible Empire.

[01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:51.600]  Spring is here.
[01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:52.641]  Growing season.
[01:22:52.821 --> 01:22:54.801]  The economy is not getting any better.
[01:22:55.001 --> 01:22:56.421]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[01:22:56.722 --> 01:22:57.402]  Think about it.
[01:22:57.702 --> 01:23:01.563]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[01:23:01.783 --> 01:23:05.284]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[01:23:05.544 --> 01:23:07.164]  The country is running out of food.
[01:23:07.444 --> 01:23:09.945]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[01:23:10.265 --> 01:23:22.178]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[01:23:22.479 --> 01:23:29.547]  Grow your very own fresh vegetables, wheatgrass, fruits, herbs, rice, tea, coffee, and tobacco.
[01:23:29.827 --> 01:23:36.433]  With detailed growing guides available to you at no charge, you can maximize your harvest and investment.
[01:23:36.694 --> 01:23:37.515]  And the best part?
[01:23:37.895 --> 01:23:39.937]  All orders ship within 24 hours.
[01:23:40.337 --> 01:23:43.000]  So head over to OrganicaSeed.com.
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:47.524]  That's O-R-G-A-N-I-C-A-S-E-E-D dot com.
[01:23:47.765 --> 01:23:49.927]  OrganicaSeed.com today.
[01:23:54.332 --> 01:24:04.361]  The establishment, the greenies, love to sit up there like they're God and tell us how guilty and evil we are for having cars and homes and swimming pools and factories.
[01:24:05.281 --> 01:24:09.385]  Meanwhile, they use these laws to shut down our factories and move them to China and India.
[01:24:10.246 --> 01:24:14.129]  They know exactly what they're doing, and they must be fully routed.
[01:24:14.189 --> 01:24:16.952]  This cancer cannot be left anywhere.
[01:24:17.632 --> 01:24:19.416]  And they've committed such incredible crimes.
[01:24:19.456 --> 01:24:21.981]  They've reached for the world through this green tyranny.
[01:24:22.502 --> 01:24:26.009]  Lord Monckton, I mean, do you agree with me that we can't just discredit them?
[01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:27.492]  They've committed crimes.
[01:24:27.772 --> 01:24:29.215]  They must be brought to justice.
[01:24:30.157 --> 01:24:56.183]  That, I think, is the fairest thing to do with people who have terrified children in schools, lied and lied and lied again in official publications, invented a threat where one doesn't exist, magnified it where one might exist, and generally worked the world up into a fervour of terror over what turns out to be a complete non-problem.
[01:24:56.203 --> 01:24:57.963]  And how do we know it is a non-problem?
[01:24:58.443 --> 01:25:00.244]  Well, we know it by measurement.
[01:25:00.764 --> 01:25:10.767]  The UN and its fellow travellers in the climate extremist Green Movement have been using what are called computer models to make their predictions.
[01:25:10.827 --> 01:25:23.552]  Now these are essentially a whole lot of zitty teenagers sitting in dark rooms with too many bagels and burgers, picking their zits, picking their noses, pecking at the keyboards and making stuff up.
[01:25:24.306 --> 01:25:27.168]  That's how the UN does the science of climate.
[01:25:27.508 --> 01:25:38.855]  But the real way to do the science of climate, like any other science, is not by modelling, which is of only limited use and should never be used as the primary tool, but by measurement.
[01:25:38.915 --> 01:25:41.677]  If I took my tie off and said, how long is this tie?
[01:25:42.037 --> 01:25:46.640]  You could ring round all the manufacturers and you could say, how long are the ties you make?
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:47.821]  How many of them do you sell?
[01:25:47.841 --> 01:25:50.943]  You put that into a computer model and make a guess, which is probably a bit wrong.
[01:25:51.463 --> 01:25:55.585]  Or you could say, give me your tyre and a tape measure and I will measure it.
[01:25:55.805 --> 01:25:57.926]  Which is going to give you the more reliable measurement.
[01:25:58.286 --> 01:25:59.887]  Of course, the measurement is.
[01:26:00.307 --> 01:26:01.448]  That's going to give you the answer.
[01:26:02.368 --> 01:26:07.971]  And by measurement, it has been established over and over and over again in the last few years.
[01:26:08.562 --> 01:26:09.943]  And we know they lied about the Earth!
[01:26:37.558 --> 01:26:43.003]  And we know the Earth has actually been getting colder and that they hid that decline in premeditated fraud.
[01:26:43.644 --> 01:26:44.865]  Well, I think they were very naughty.
[01:26:44.905 --> 01:26:56.135]  What they were trying to do in that particular email from the ClimateGate emails that are exchanged between the leading mad scientists of the world who have been stirring up this
[01:26:57.253 --> 01:27:22.083]  Is they were trying to hide the fact that although temperatures were shown to be going up in the real world by measurement, the proxy, the so-called bristlecone pine proxies they were using to try and reconstruct past temperatures, when they came to try and reconstruct the temperatures of the present time, appeared to show that temperatures should have been falling.
[01:27:22.103 --> 01:27:24.364]  I think it was this mismatch between
[01:27:24.935 --> 01:27:32.010]  The real temperature record and the temperature record as reconstructed in that brief period where we had a real temperature record.
[01:27:32.110 --> 01:27:32.692]  Check it again!
[01:27:33.306 --> 01:27:40.852]  That showed that the record of past temperatures where we didn't have instruments was entirely unreliable.
[01:27:40.892 --> 01:27:43.695]  It was that that they were trying to conceal.
[01:27:43.915 --> 01:27:45.977]  And they were trying to conceal it deliberately.
[01:27:46.257 --> 01:27:48.719]  It was clearly intended to be dishonest.
[01:27:49.059 --> 01:27:59.668]  And the extraordinary thing is that first the House of Commons, then the University of East Anglia whitewashed this away and said that nothing incorrect, nothing wrong had been done.
[01:27:59.888 --> 01:28:00.949]  Here are scientists
[01:28:01.350 --> 01:28:12.028]  Lying to each other and to us in the hope of persuading us to spend trillions upon trillions in shutting down the economies of the West.
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:30.144]  Notice that you don't hear these Green campaigners saying that China should clean up its filthy, polluting coal-fired power stations where they haven't bothered to put the fly ash trappers and they haven't put the new circulating fluidised bed techniques into the combustion chambers.
[01:28:30.524 --> 01:28:36.766]  All of these things they need to modernise, they can well afford to modernise it, but they don't do it because they don't care about the pollution they're causing.
[01:28:37.026 --> 01:28:38.366]  Do the Greenies campaign
[01:28:38.846 --> 01:28:45.592]  About where the real pollution is going on, in China, in India, in Indonesia, in Russia, in Brazil, in South Africa.
[01:28:45.932 --> 01:28:46.993]  Do they heck!
[01:28:47.453 --> 01:28:57.801]  Their intention is to close down the countries of the world which are the environmentally cleanest, because these are not environmentalists, they are communists.
[01:28:58.282 --> 01:29:00.884]  And their aim is to destroy the West.
[01:29:02.185 --> 01:29:02.985]  And they've said that.
[01:29:03.025 --> 01:29:12.549]  I mean, we've got the head climatologist at NASA, we've got Maury Strong, we've got Ted Turner, saying we must destroy industrialized society, but only in the West.
[01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:20.792]  I mean, a crime against humanity, and of course you go over the numbers of how many people will die in the third world under the carbon regime that was in the Copenhagen Treaty.
[01:29:21.452 --> 01:29:24.033]  We'll talk about that, plus all the news scandals.
[01:29:24.873 --> 01:29:25.554]  That have come out.
[01:29:25.914 --> 01:29:32.058]  And I'm not talking about the stuff from a month ago with the Himalayas, where they used a photography student's report to claim they were melting.
[01:29:32.298 --> 01:29:35.940]  No, I'm talking about all the new stunning information coming out.
[01:29:36.301 --> 01:29:38.122]  Straight ahead with Lord Christopher Monckton.
[01:29:38.142 --> 01:29:39.242]  Long segment coming up.
[01:29:39.543 --> 01:29:40.083]  Stay with us.
[01:29:42.224 --> 01:29:43.125]  We're on the march.
[01:29:43.625 --> 01:29:45.226]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:46.147 --> 01:29:48.829]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:51.491 --> 01:29:53.812]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:29:53.832 --> 01:29:56.093]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:29:56.213 --> 01:29:59.014]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:29:59.415 --> 01:30:04.177]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:30:04.537 --> 01:30:08.719]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:30:09.039 --> 01:30:11.361]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:30:11.381 --> 01:30:13.904]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:30:13.924 --> 01:30:16.846]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.

[01:30:51.448 --> 01:30:52.689]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:52.749 --> 01:30:58.075]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:30:58.335 --> 01:31:02.960]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:08.386]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:31:08.906 --> 01:31:13.609]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:31:14.150 --> 01:31:16.071]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:31:16.451 --> 01:31:21.074]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:31:21.254 --> 01:31:22.155]  And here's the best part.
[01:31:22.355 --> 01:31:25.137]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:31:25.437 --> 01:31:28.739]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:31:29.060 --> 01:31:31.902]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:31:32.262 --> 01:31:34.143]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:31:34.483 --> 01:31:35.404]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:31:39.026 --> 01:31:40.066]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:31:40.467 --> 01:31:47.789]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:31:48.089 --> 01:31:50.550]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:51.250 --> 01:31:56.432]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:31:56.552 --> 01:31:59.272]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:31:59.292 --> 01:32:03.794]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:32:04.634 --> 01:32:09.078]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.

[01:32:56.954 --> 01:32:59.535]  We're going to take a few calls for Lord Christopher Monckton.
[01:32:59.595 --> 01:33:01.696]  Your questions for him, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:01.716 --> 01:33:11.621]  Don't forget, coming up in an hour and a half, we're premiering the new film, Invisible Empire, New Order Defined, exposing these criminals.
[01:33:12.261 --> 01:33:14.663]  Jason Burmas' new film premiering at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:14.723 --> 01:33:17.384]  You can order the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:33:17.424 --> 01:33:18.264]  They're now shipping.
[01:33:18.705 --> 01:33:20.626]  Next week, Police State 4 comes out on Wednesday.
[01:33:20.646 --> 01:33:22.166]  You can pre-order that now.
[01:33:22.687 --> 01:33:24.587]  Lord Monckton, so much to go over here.
[01:33:25.868 --> 01:33:27.089]  I can't even keep track of it.
[01:33:27.210 --> 01:33:28.551]  Every day a new scandal.
[01:33:28.911 --> 01:33:31.574]  Every day it's proven that all their science is fraud.
[01:33:31.934 --> 01:33:32.715]  Premeditatedly.
[01:33:32.735 --> 01:33:33.276]  And then this one.
[01:33:33.556 --> 01:33:34.757]  Financial Times of London.
[01:33:35.137 --> 01:33:37.240]  Global warming graph attacked by study.
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:43.286]  A key piece of evidence climate change science was slammed as exaggerated on Wednesday by UK's leading statistician.
[01:33:43.806 --> 01:33:58.894]  In a vindication of claims that global warming skeptics have made for years, namely Lord Monckton, who first exposed the hockey stick, and now we know that Mann has been involved with Jones and others at the core, group engaging in this what can only be called racketeering.
[01:33:58.914 --> 01:34:08.558]  So let's go over this and the countless other scandals that have come out, because it's positive this is all coming out, but it's almost like they're coming out too quick.
[01:34:08.838 --> 01:34:11.600]  We don't have time to take each one and get it out to the public.
[01:34:12.361 --> 01:34:30.254]  It is quite extraordinary how in the last few months since the climate gate emails were first revealed there's been a kind of breaking of the log jam and scientists who for years have been wanting to write papers saying what nonsense this is are now finding the courage to do so.
[01:34:30.814 --> 01:34:37.279]  It's very interesting and this statistical report from the UK is very significant because the UK has been
[01:34:37.859 --> 01:34:44.465]  The most true believing of all the sappy world governments on this issue.
[01:34:45.126 --> 01:34:55.775]  And so much so that in 2004, when the Russians under Vladimir Putin wanted to get a briefing for their Academy of Sciences,
[01:34:56.415 --> 01:35:05.306]  On the global warming scare, it was the British government they asked to send a delegation to do the briefing and Sir David King went across with those people.
[01:35:05.506 --> 01:35:12.374]  However, Dr. Ilya Ryunov of the Russian Academy of Sciences, who is a formidable mind,
[01:35:12.978 --> 01:35:19.484]  He's also very careful, and he got together half a dozen sceptics, one of whom told me the story of what happened.
[01:35:19.924 --> 01:35:27.110]  So David King began coming out with the usual string of lies about how the climate was doomed, etc, etc.
[01:35:27.190 --> 01:35:29.092]  Fact after fact was simply incorrect.
[01:35:29.924 --> 01:35:45.115]  And eventually, Professor Paul Reiter, who was one of those who'd been invited, the world expert on malaria, who says that global warming will not affect the spread of malaria pretty much at all, he went along and he stood up and he said, it's no good to David King, these facts are simply not right.
[01:35:45.175 --> 01:35:47.277]  And he began challenging David King on these facts.
[01:35:47.597 --> 01:35:48.938]  David King was furious.
[01:35:48.958 --> 01:35:51.740]  He had never faced such a challenge before.
[01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:55.563]  He stormed out of the meeting, taking the British delegation
[01:35:56.820 --> 01:36:19.236]  Leaving the field entirely clear for the sceptics, who then gave a marvellous, thorough, comprehensive briefing to Dr. Ilarionov, who, in summing up that meeting in just three pages of text, gives one of the best summaries of why global warming is not and could never be a global crisis that any National Academy of Sciences has ever delivered.
[01:36:19.256 --> 01:36:20.537]  But here's what happened next.
[01:36:21.184 --> 01:36:31.451]  Tony Blair met Vladimir Putin at one of these endless world government summits of the G8 or the G20 or the G77 or whichever piece of arithmetic you like.
[01:36:32.072 --> 01:36:33.813]  And he said, look, let's do a deal.
[01:36:34.313 --> 01:36:49.084]  If you agree to say that global warming is terrible and shut up your Academy of Sciences, get it to say the opposite of what it believes to be true, I will let you into the World Trade Organization with most favoured nation status.
[01:36:49.703 --> 01:36:50.747]  That's what goes on.
[01:36:51.189 --> 01:36:53.219]  There's no truth behind any of this.
[01:36:53.946 --> 01:37:11.218]  And, as you're quite right, it's now very, very difficult to keep up with the endless tide of information about how it's the sun, and it's the sea, and it's the cloud, and, as we're about to discover from Iceland, it's also volcanoes that really dominate the climate.
[01:37:11.298 --> 01:37:12.199]  Let me raise that.
[01:37:12.279 --> 01:37:12.879]  Let me raise that.
[01:37:12.899 --> 01:37:15.241]  I have a Twitter question for you.
[01:37:15.361 --> 01:37:22.686]  It says, Lord Moncton, are they aware that the volcanic eruption in Iceland will decrease global temperatures?
[01:37:23.686 --> 01:37:42.279]  Yes, they are aware of that because they know that if you get a really big eruption, it looks as though this one may come into that category, it's slightly early days, yeah, but if it carries on for a day or two more as it is, then yes, it will be a big one, then that throws so much volcanic ash up, as you know, it shuts down the whole of Europe and the Atlantic.
[01:37:42.959 --> 01:37:50.268]  All flights in Britain are already grounded, though curiously Reykjavik Airport, which is upwind of this, is still free for traffic.
[01:37:50.609 --> 01:37:59.800]  But when you get enough of that volcanic ash getting up into the atmosphere, it stops the sunlight reaching the ground and that causes
[01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:15.191]  Global cooling of around half a degree, sometimes even one degree Celsius, but only for six months to a year because eventually, of course, the rain comes and the ash, which is heavier than the air, gradually falls back to the ground to provide very nice fertilizer for everybody's soil.
[01:38:15.591 --> 01:38:16.392]  Does no harm.
[01:38:17.352 --> 01:38:20.655]  And then the sunlight can get through much as usual again.
[01:38:21.075 --> 01:38:26.239]  However, what we did notice after the last really big eruption, which was Pinatubo in 1991, what then happened
[01:38:29.696 --> 01:38:37.821]  Was that there was a temporary reduction in cloud cover following the year after that eruption and persisting for about a decade.
[01:38:38.241 --> 01:38:41.543]  And that of course caused an enormous increase in global temperature.
[01:38:41.783 --> 01:38:44.965]  So we may, paradoxically as a result of this eruption,
[01:38:45.865 --> 01:38:53.108]  But Lord Monckton, hold on, couldn't we just pay Al Gore a couple billion and he would give us an indulgence and wave a magic wand and make the volcanoes not erupt?
[01:38:53.128 --> 01:38:55.969]  Because, I mean, after all, Danny Glover and then a UN official
[01:39:10.514 --> 01:39:19.939]  said that the earthquake in Haiti was caused by global warming, and now they're claiming the Chilean earthquake was caused.
[01:39:19.999 --> 01:39:22.940]  So if we just pay them some money, will they stop the earthquakes?
[01:39:23.621 --> 01:39:24.881]  Oh, just like that, yes.
[01:39:25.162 --> 01:39:29.364]  Al Gore has only to stretch out his hand and the entire world will stop spinning around.
[01:39:29.384 --> 01:39:30.264]  It will all fly off.
[01:39:31.045 --> 01:39:32.025]  Of course, it's ridiculous.
[01:39:32.465 --> 01:39:39.709]  One knows perfectly well that global warming cannot possibly cause or have any connection with
[01:39:40.229 --> 01:39:40.810]  Earthquakes.
[01:39:41.190 --> 01:39:49.697]  They are driven by a completely separate mechanism a long way below the Earth's surface, wholly disconnected from the climate above.
[01:39:50.117 --> 01:39:52.799]  And it is simple rubbish to try to suggest otherwise.
[01:39:53.159 --> 01:39:55.221]  Of course, you've noticed it's the fashion now.
[01:39:55.521 --> 01:40:09.289]  That every kind of weather that is happening, you've just had the coldest winter on record in most of North America, and of course the warmest came straight out, the climate expert said, oh yes, that's what we would expect from global warming.
[01:40:09.309 --> 01:40:19.334]  So here's the thing, we expect earthquakes from global warming, we expect warming from global warming, we expect cooling from global warming, we expect floods from global warming, we expect droughts from global warming.
[01:40:19.634 --> 01:40:20.895]  Hang on a moment.
[01:40:21.571 --> 01:40:29.458]  All we're really saying is that whichever direction the climate changes in, they're going to blame it on global warming, whether it has anything to do with global warming or not.
[01:40:29.478 --> 01:40:30.499]  But that's my next point, Lord Monckton.
[01:40:31.119 --> 01:40:34.562]  Lord Monckton, interrupt, because we've got limited time and these facts are so key.
[01:40:35.343 --> 01:40:36.624]  We know they've been caught in fraud.
[01:40:36.664 --> 01:40:39.927]  We know they have an agenda to control our lives and become kings over us.
[01:40:39.967 --> 01:40:40.988]  We understand that.
[01:40:42.129 --> 01:40:44.151]  And the general public's beginning to understand that.
[01:40:44.191 --> 01:40:47.634]  But for me, going back years, it's just the asinine level.
[01:40:47.734 --> 01:40:48.654]  I can go look up
[01:40:49.375 --> 01:41:04.341]  The federal government numbers on polar bears and they've gone from roughly 22,000 30 years ago in our area of the world in North America to over 50,000 and so when Al Gore says the polar bears are all dying
[01:41:04.781 --> 01:41:05.502]  We know it's a lie.
[01:41:05.522 --> 01:41:08.825]  When they say in the Arctic, penguins are dying because they're drowning.
[01:41:08.865 --> 01:41:10.086]  We know they're an aquatic bird.
[01:41:10.106 --> 01:41:12.688]  I mean, the level of asinine lying.
[01:41:12.708 --> 01:41:22.377]  But the one I want to talk about now, because we're showing video of this, both a 20-year time lapse and then this year's time lapse from satellites, we know the Arctic expanded.
[01:41:22.397 --> 01:41:23.118]  This is admitted.
[01:41:24.179 --> 01:41:27.881]  By the greatest level in the last 30 years, that's admitted by NASA.
[01:41:27.961 --> 01:41:32.784]  And I'm showing a NASA satellite composite right now of it growing this year.
[01:41:33.284 --> 01:41:40.369]  And then I've seen the environmental phonies on the news saying it's not true that the ice caps are melting.
[01:41:40.449 --> 01:41:43.571]  I mean, they are denying that the sun comes up in the morning.
[01:41:43.611 --> 01:41:45.332]  They are outrageous liars!
[01:41:46.092 --> 01:41:51.795]  It's extraordinary that on the polar bears, for instance, there were only 5,000 worldwide in the 1940s.
[01:41:53.268 --> 01:42:00.849]  Now, depending on which survey you read, there are 25,000 worldwide, and you've seen one that says there are 50,000 just in North America.
[01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:06.310]  The fact is that that's not the profile of a species in imminent threat of extinction, is it?
[01:42:06.731 --> 01:42:07.811]  Likewise, the penguins.
[01:42:08.071 --> 01:42:12.772]  And of course, in the Antarctic, the sea ice has actually been growing for 30 years.
[01:42:13.052 --> 01:42:19.593]  And I was talking to one of these true-believing scientists about that the other day, and he said, oh yes, but that's caused by katabatic winds.
[01:42:19.993 --> 01:42:25.001]  Coming down off the Antarctic ice cap and freezing the sea.
[01:42:25.262 --> 01:42:33.414]  And of course, yes it is, because the Antarctic has been getting cooler over the last 30 years, as the records very plainly show.
[01:42:33.515 --> 01:42:35.077]  Though you won't see that reported in the
[01:42:35.177 --> 01:42:37.438]  But that's what I'm saying, Lord Monckton.
[01:42:38.038 --> 01:42:39.218]  It's the boldness.
[01:42:39.538 --> 01:42:55.342]  I've never seen total contempt for the public, and I guess some of the public really are dumb as a box of rocks, to tell them the Arctic and Antarctic are in danger of completely melting within the next five years, as Al Gore was just saying a few months ago at Copenhagen.
[01:42:55.382 --> 01:43:02.664]  I mean, it is an asinine fraud to tell schoolchildren that it's all melting when they know good and well it's getting bigger.
[01:43:03.024 --> 01:43:17.684]  Well, just to go to the Arctic and give you the latest figures, the beginning of the spring ice melt in the Arctic began later this year than at any time since record began.
[01:43:18.453 --> 01:43:27.221]  That's the truth of the matter, because there's an awful lot of ice up there just now, and it will go back to more or less normal in the next few weeks, just as it always does.
[01:43:27.662 --> 01:43:32.466]  Then we'll see how it is in the summer, which will depend partly on the volcanic activity in Iceland, obviously.
[01:43:32.867 --> 01:43:41.535]  These things come and go, they're perfectly natural swings and roundabouts, but we know perfectly well that even if we were to lose a lot of ice in the Arctic,
[01:43:41.915 --> 01:43:53.381]  We've gained just as much in the Antarctic so that global sea ice has shown virtually no trend whatsoever over the last 30 years since the satellite first began to record it reliably.
[01:43:53.661 --> 01:44:09.489]  So whatever else is going on, it isn't global warming that's causing the little bit of melting that did happen in the Arctic just for a few weeks only in the summer of 2007 and very nearly all of that summer minimum ice was restored in 2008 and still more again in 2009.
[01:44:09.549 --> 01:44:10.349]  Those are the facts.
[01:44:12.093 --> 01:44:19.930]  Well, I know you challenged them on their phony science, but just the general propaganda that's given to the public, it's very elementary.
[01:44:20.251 --> 01:44:21.193]  They point a camera...
[01:44:22.111 --> 01:44:39.526]  On every news show, during the spring and summer, at a glacier that's being built up by rain and snow during the winter and fall, fall and winter, they show the glaciers collapsing, ice flows and icebergs that have always done this, since we had ice caps, and they say, look, it's melting!
[01:44:39.867 --> 01:44:48.895]  I mean, even the reporters have to know they're involved in a premeditated fraud, or are these reporters, for lack of a better term, mentally retarded?
[01:44:49.597 --> 01:45:07.652]  It's even more of a fraud than you think, because the most frequently shown picture of a large chunk of supposedly Greenland glacial ice falling off into the sea is in fact taken from a glacier in South America, which is a land-based glacier where it crosses a lake.
[01:45:07.692 --> 01:45:09.274]  So it looks like the sea, but actually it isn't.
[01:45:09.934 --> 01:45:20.597]  And every five years, this glacier goes right across the lake and dams the lake, the water behind the lake, which then builds up and bursts through, causing enormous chunks of ice to come off.
[01:45:21.077 --> 01:45:33.881]  What's interesting is that because there's been regional cooling over the last 30 years in that part of South America as well, that glacier that used to burst apart every five years is now bursting apart every two years.
[01:45:34.201 --> 01:45:37.322]  Because there's more and more ice coming across and blocking the lake.
[01:45:37.662 --> 01:45:40.942]  So that in itself is another spectacular lie.
[01:45:41.242 --> 01:45:53.144]  And to name another one of that kind, when Al Gore shows a picture of flying over what is supposed to be the melting Arctic ice, it is in fact a computer simulation and not the real thing.
[01:45:53.664 --> 01:46:02.186]  So everything that you're being shown, everything that you're being told about the supposed effect of supposed global warming is
[01:46:02.725 --> 01:46:08.407]  It's bogus, and even if it weren't bogus, the fact is we've had 300 years of global warming.
[01:46:08.427 --> 01:46:14.670]  It began, we can date it exactly thanks to the Central England Temperature Record, which is the earliest instrumental record in the world.
[01:46:14.810 --> 01:46:22.033]  It began in 1695, and in the next 40 years, the temperatures rose by 4 Fahrenheit degrees.
[01:46:22.648 --> 01:46:26.129]  That's one Fahrenheit degree for every decade.
[01:46:26.469 --> 01:46:32.391]  It's not done that since, because in the whole of the 20th century, it only rose by one Fahrenheit degree.
[01:46:32.831 --> 01:46:42.273]  So the idea that somehow the increase in temperatures over the 20th century is something new, the idea that it was an unprecedented rate, is simply nonsense.
[01:46:42.393 --> 01:46:47.615]  And we know from the records we have going back 300 years that it is obvious and errant.
[01:46:48.658 --> 01:46:51.849]  And yet, this is the kind of rubbish they go on peddling.
[01:46:52.210 --> 01:46:54.418]  They say, for instance, that the warming...
[01:46:55.231 --> 01:47:01.234]  Since 1950 can only be explained if you assume that CO2 was the major cause.
[01:47:01.614 --> 01:47:02.914]  No, that's not correct.
[01:47:03.375 --> 01:47:17.501]  All of the warming, and I mean all the warming since 1950, can be explained by the temporary and naturally occurring reduction in cloud cover that happened between 1983 and 2001 when we had satellites up there to watch it.
[01:47:17.921 --> 01:47:19.602]  And that blows into smithereens.
[01:47:20.962 --> 01:47:25.604]  And finally, sir, to simplify this for some people out there who may not be following us,
[01:47:50.656 --> 01:48:00.258]  They're now moving away from saying global warming, because that's been exposed as a fraud, to climate change and saying stabilizing our climate as if we're not supposed to have seasons.
[01:48:00.318 --> 01:48:19.282]  I mean, if they had their way in a hundred years, they'll have children cowering under their beds at night and saying, Mommy, the conspiracy theorist down the road, you know, is saying that we've always had seasons, but the government says that seasons are unnatural and we've got to pay all these taxes to try to battle, you know, changes in temperature.
[01:48:19.903 --> 01:48:21.084]  I think that's a great point.
[01:48:21.465 --> 01:48:34.626]  I think the fact is that the change in temperature in any one region of the planet between the summer and the winter is something like 20 times what's going to happen even if we get a little bit of global warming over the next hundred years, which we may.
[01:48:35.066 --> 01:48:39.632]  But it's going to be so small and so insignificant that it's not going to do any harm to anyone.
[01:48:39.973 --> 01:48:41.635]  And that's really the simple bottom line.
[01:48:41.655 --> 01:48:45.940]  I'm sorry if that last answer sounded a little bit too complicated, but it's really quite simple.
[01:48:46.201 --> 01:48:53.330]  If you get a naturally occurring reduction in cloud cover, fewer clouds between the sun and the ground, more sunlight hits the ground.
[01:48:53.770 --> 01:48:58.733]  And the ground gets warmer and it gets warmer naturally and nothing whatever to do with CO2.
[01:48:58.933 --> 01:48:59.994]  It's really as simple as that.
[01:49:00.214 --> 01:49:09.359]  And we can do a simple calculation based on that to work out what the warming effect of CO2 over those 18 years from 1983 to 2001 could possibly have been.
[01:49:09.579 --> 01:49:13.322]  And the answer is there's virtually no room for it to have had any influence at all.
[01:49:13.562 --> 01:49:18.845]  And of course, since the end of 2001, we've had rapid, significant global cooling anyway.
[01:49:19.352 --> 01:49:21.453]  Lord Monckton, I'm going to skip this final break.
[01:49:21.473 --> 01:49:23.313]  We've only got 10 minutes left with you.
[01:49:23.333 --> 01:49:26.214]  Again, you're always extremely gracious to give us so much time.
[01:49:26.234 --> 01:49:37.757]  I know you're in demand globally, but that's another indicator of the good news is that you were wanted, you know, in front of crowds of tens of thousands and television and radio and TV, 24 hours a day, more than you could ever do.
[01:49:37.797 --> 01:49:40.058]  And we're appreciative of your great stamina.
[01:49:40.618 --> 01:49:40.638]  I
[01:49:57.518 --> 01:49:58.999]  Just how elementary this
[01:50:15.153 --> 01:50:16.734]  And we just know this is a fraud.
[01:50:16.774 --> 01:50:24.198]  We know that we had the Bronze Age because temperature went up by over 10 degrees, much warmer than the last warming period we've seen in the last 50 years.
[01:50:24.238 --> 01:50:26.120]  And it's just so ridiculous.
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:28.921]  Let's talk to MD in Maine.
[01:50:29.221 --> 01:50:31.202]  You're on the air with Lord Christopher Monckton.
[01:50:31.222 --> 01:50:34.804]  His website is scienceandpublicpolicy.org.
[01:50:34.844 --> 01:50:35.245]  Go ahead.
[01:50:36.085 --> 01:50:42.228]  Yes, Lord Monkton, welcome to America, and this is a question for you and Alex on a financial question.
[01:50:42.869 --> 01:50:53.794]  Specifically, we know that the pension funds in America are being targeted by the government as a way to back up the Treasuries, but my specific question is 401Ks and IRAs.
[01:50:55.402 --> 01:51:00.285]  Are those on the radar screen as well, and will those be targeted, and if so, how soon will that happen?
[01:51:00.305 --> 01:51:13.994]  Alright, MD, MD, specifically, I'm now reminded Lord Monckton, going into break, tried to get into the financial ruination that we're seeing through the Obama collectivist takeover, and yes, it is in Bloomberg, they're looking at taking your pension funds.
[01:51:14.014 --> 01:51:14.515]  Lord Monckton.
[01:51:15.015 --> 01:51:31.150]  Yes, I think you've got to realise that so bankrupt is America now at the federal level, and so wicked is the sheer scale on which the present administration has ramped up spending artificially in the short term,
[01:51:31.750 --> 01:51:48.779]  So as to make our children, our children's children, and their children in turn pay for the self-indulgence of this, and I'm going to call it again what it is, a communist administration, that yes, you are going to find that every penny that you've got, which isn't hidden under the mattress,
[01:51:49.409 --> 01:51:53.071]  Any penny that you've got that they can find, they're going to come after it.
[01:51:53.392 --> 01:51:56.834]  Your pensions are not going to be safe under this administration.
[01:51:57.234 --> 01:52:17.627]  Anyone who has had the providence and the thrift to save for his or her old age is going to find the sticky-fingered government coming in there and at first increasing the taxes on it and then arbitrarily confiscating it altogether and saying, as they did with healthcare, we in the federal government are going to provide your pensions
[01:52:18.067 --> 01:52:21.508]  And in order to do that, we want you to hand over all your pension money.
[01:52:21.748 --> 01:52:38.234]  There is a real danger that an administration as wild, and as fiscally irresponsible, and as monetarily incompetent as this one, and as malevolent towards the American people as this one has shown itself repeatedly to be, will indeed come after your pension.
[01:52:38.654 --> 01:52:40.794]  Nothing and no one is safe.
[01:52:41.315 --> 01:52:43.895]  And my three magic words I repeat again.
[01:52:44.376 --> 01:52:44.616]  Vote.
[01:52:44.896 --> 01:52:45.116]  Them.
[01:52:45.516 --> 01:52:45.616]  Out.
[01:52:46.545 --> 01:52:48.126]  And you were trying to talk about health care earlier.
[01:52:48.146 --> 01:52:53.107]  I do want to take a few more calls, but specifically, you're in England with the National Health Service.
[01:52:53.547 --> 01:52:58.869]  The VA runs health care here for veterans, the worst health care in the world, when government has a hand in it.
[01:52:59.389 --> 01:53:01.770]  In 60 seconds, your breakdown on government-run health care.
[01:53:02.409 --> 01:53:04.450]  Just don't go there is the short answer.
[01:53:05.031 --> 01:53:07.212]  It's been an enormous failure in Britain.
[01:53:07.572 --> 01:53:09.753]  It was supposed to be the envy of the world.
[01:53:09.953 --> 01:53:13.895]  Absolutely nobody has copied the way the British does it until now.
[01:53:14.336 --> 01:53:16.197]  And now here we have Obamacare.
[01:53:16.437 --> 01:53:19.879]  He didn't get away with the public option full-blown.
[01:53:20.159 --> 01:53:29.044]  What he's done instead is to defer to the huge companies and corporations that run healthcare and make sure that they are going to make vastly increased profits
[01:53:29.424 --> 01:53:35.310]  By forcing people into paying for healthcare via state-run exchanges.
[01:53:35.650 --> 01:53:38.873]  The whole mess is going to be a bureaucratic nightmare.
[01:53:38.933 --> 01:53:40.195]  It's going to cost a fortune.
[01:53:40.515 --> 01:53:42.097]  Healthcare standards will plummet.
[01:53:42.397 --> 01:53:47.382]  And already I know of several of your leading doctors who are simply going to up sticks and get out.
[01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:54.702]  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, you just heard intense Veritas.
[01:53:55.082 --> 01:53:55.722]  The truth.
[01:53:56.282 --> 01:54:01.164]  This is global corporations, big healthcare, coming in and robbing you.
[01:54:01.204 --> 01:54:02.364]  Government keeps half of it.
[01:54:02.904 --> 01:54:04.004]  Corporations keep the other.
[01:54:04.024 --> 01:54:05.305]  They lower your standard of care.
[01:54:05.625 --> 01:54:06.785]  Well said, Lord Monckton.
[01:54:07.125 --> 01:54:08.706]  Let's talk to Brian in California.
[01:54:08.726 --> 01:54:09.246]  You're on the air.
[01:54:10.404 --> 01:54:11.284]  Hello, Alex.
[01:54:11.884 --> 01:54:16.185]  I'm here with my Sweden-lovable wife, who's a major contributor.
[01:54:16.205 --> 01:54:29.428]  I made an observation some time ago that the signing of the Federal Reserve Act was exactly, to date, 99 years after the signing of the Treaty of Ghent.
[01:54:29.928 --> 01:54:34.829]  Now, if you take exactly 99 years to the date after the Federal Reserve Act,
[01:54:35.644 --> 01:54:36.785]  You land on the 2012 Doomsday.
[01:54:48.391 --> 01:54:50.793]  Lord Monckton, I want to ask you a question for Alex.
[01:54:50.853 --> 01:55:07.630]  I'm sure he doesn't want to bother to ask you, but he's been attacked by a number of people in the press, and some of these press reach England, and you know that the system in England would clip these birds' wings pretty quickly, especially when they're saying he's threatening violence because he's telling the truth.
[01:55:07.930 --> 01:55:11.172]  Can you give him some good advice on how to... Well, let me fill Lord Monckton in.
[01:55:11.192 --> 01:55:17.175]  They've had Newsweek, Time Magazine, even the London Guardian, actually, saying I'm calling for violence when I've never done anything like that.
[01:55:17.395 --> 01:55:19.156]  But they're also saying that about the Tea Parties.
[01:55:19.496 --> 01:55:21.277]  They're also saying that about Rick Perry.
[01:55:21.557 --> 01:55:23.198]  I mean, they're saying it about everybody.
[01:55:23.238 --> 01:55:35.104]  And now, I don't know if Lord Monckton saw this, but the AP reported two days ago that Democrats have been caught with fake N-word signs, and they've been caught infiltrating Tea Parties trying to make us look bad.
[01:55:35.484 --> 01:55:35.824]  That's right.
[01:55:35.844 --> 01:55:38.186]  This is a very classic communist technique.
[01:55:38.566 --> 01:55:43.209]  It was done by Hitler, who of course was a National Socialist, which is another kind of communism.
[01:55:43.950 --> 01:55:46.711]  It was done by the communists when they were taking over in Russia.
[01:55:47.052 --> 01:55:50.934]  It's an absolutely typical extreme left-wing technique.
[01:55:51.254 --> 01:56:00.921]  They try to discredit those whom they fear, knowing that they can rely upon the liberal tendencies of the mainstream media not to bother to ask the right questions.
[01:56:01.421 --> 01:56:11.407]  It's a very good question that your caller raises, and my advice is, of course, you should never advocate any kind of violence, nor, Alex, would you ever have done so.
[01:56:11.567 --> 01:56:15.089]  Well, we've done the opposite, but I mean, especially George Soros.
[01:56:15.129 --> 01:56:18.971]  He's got like eight different publications that every week just lie.
[01:56:18.991 --> 01:56:20.832]  I mean, I could sue them, but I don't have the time.
[01:56:21.913 --> 01:56:23.735]  I don't think it's ever worth suing these people.
[01:56:23.795 --> 01:56:34.510]  I think the answer is just to go on speaking the truth, speaking it gently, and it's rather like what Glenn Beck has been saying on his wonderful program on Fox News.
[01:56:34.910 --> 01:56:38.315]  He says the hammer of non-violence has to hit the anvil of truth.
[01:56:38.815 --> 01:56:39.595]  So you've gone through this too?
[01:56:39.615 --> 01:56:41.376]  I mean, you have them trying to set you up.
[01:57:06.386 --> 01:57:07.587]  Oh, they're always doing that.
[01:57:07.848 --> 01:57:09.369]  But I pay no attention to it.
[01:57:09.810 --> 01:57:11.631]  And you just have to go on quietly.
[01:57:11.692 --> 01:57:13.974]  I'm just quietly getting on with my scientific research.
[01:57:14.014 --> 01:57:16.997]  I pop up from time to time and publish the results.
[01:57:17.057 --> 01:57:25.946]  I'm just about to publish a major paper on this business of the effect of clouds on climate, which shows perfectly well that CO2 has virtually nothing to do with anything
[01:57:26.466 --> 01:57:28.006]  And that's the way I do it.
[01:57:28.026 --> 01:57:33.567]  We just quietly publish the science in the peer-reviewed journals, let people read it there, and make of it what they will.
[01:57:33.788 --> 01:57:42.069]  That's the way science is done, and I don't mind how many sticks and stones they try to throw, how many... but words certainly won't hurt me.
[01:57:42.449 --> 01:57:46.070]  And the thing is, just be courageous, carry on speaking the truth.
[01:57:46.450 --> 01:57:50.871]  The truth, in the end, as we are told in the Bible, will prevail.
[01:57:51.974 --> 01:57:52.654]  Absolutely.
[01:57:53.095 --> 01:57:56.076]  Lord Monckton, we've only got about 45 seconds left.
[01:57:56.116 --> 01:57:57.137]  I appreciate your time.
[01:57:57.457 --> 01:57:59.137]  Scienceandpublicpolicy.org.
[01:57:59.158 --> 01:58:03.500]  I know you say as soon as you're done defeating these people, you're going to write a book.
[01:58:03.780 --> 01:58:05.621]  We look forward to having you on to cover that.
[01:58:05.981 --> 01:58:07.622]  And just so much continues to happen.
[01:58:08.302 --> 01:58:09.062]  And again, 5 to 10 p.m.
[01:58:11.103 --> 01:58:12.844]  Eastern today in front of the Washington Monument.
[01:58:12.884 --> 01:58:21.429]  Lord Monckton and others will be there, so definitely we look forward to watching those videos online here from Austin and other areas of the planet from your eloquent speech.
[01:58:21.750 --> 01:58:22.930]  Thank you so much for your time.
[01:58:23.511 --> 01:58:28.153]  File your tax return on time by the close of play today, and God bless America.
[01:58:28.934 --> 01:58:29.474]  Take care.
[01:58:29.774 --> 01:58:30.795]  Lord Monckton, thank you.

[02:00:54.208 --> 02:00:57.290]  $19.95 your purchase makes the radio show possible.
[02:00:57.750 --> 02:01:00.191]  It is infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:01:00.251 --> 02:01:00.512]  Okay.
[02:01:04.850 --> 02:01:07.392]  I've got tax news I want to go over.
[02:01:07.493 --> 02:01:08.794]  I've got police state news.
[02:01:09.034 --> 02:01:10.555]  I've got big government news.
[02:01:10.675 --> 02:01:13.058]  I've got big developments in Poland.
[02:01:13.758 --> 02:01:18.483]  It's looking more and more like foul play with the death of the president and others last Saturday.
[02:01:19.664 --> 02:01:22.686]  That is all coming up.
[02:01:22.747 --> 02:01:23.968]  I've got my stacks here.
[02:01:24.108 --> 02:01:28.172]  But when we come back from this break,
[02:01:29.585 --> 02:01:31.266]  I'm going to play a video.
[02:01:31.826 --> 02:01:38.750]  When we come back from this break, I'm going to play video for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, and of course, Radiolicious will be able to hear the audio.
[02:01:39.250 --> 02:01:43.012]  And then in the next few hours, this will be posted up on the Alex Jones YouTube channel.
[02:01:43.052 --> 02:01:44.033]  But it's not there yet.
[02:01:44.833 --> 02:01:46.894]  This will be the premiere of this information.
[02:01:48.075 --> 02:01:52.997]  Now, when we come back after the video, I will describe more of why I did this.
[02:01:54.058 --> 02:01:54.338]  Okay?
[02:01:57.128 --> 02:02:01.709]  First off, I was joking around the office about doing what I did, just as a joke.
[02:02:03.250 --> 02:02:05.010]  Because we had a power drill laying there.
[02:02:06.131 --> 02:02:09.792]  And people, a few people got up and were like, oh, don't do that, it's, you know, it's wasteful, whatever.
[02:02:10.032 --> 02:02:13.773]  Then my wife was like, oh, no, no, you know, don't do it, it's so sweet, it's so good.
[02:02:14.693 --> 02:02:17.274]  Like it was a human or something.
[02:02:17.814 --> 02:02:20.655]  And that got me thinking about priorities.
[02:02:21.435 --> 02:02:22.015]  With all of us.
[02:02:24.096 --> 02:02:25.016]  And then I thought about
[02:02:26.906 --> 02:02:30.008]  Well, all these other facets that I break down at the end of the video.
[02:02:30.828 --> 02:02:32.229]  All these other reasons.
[02:02:34.931 --> 02:02:40.594]  Because this is going to be extremely educational on multiple, multiple fronts.
[02:02:41.834 --> 02:02:42.675]  What you're going to see.
[02:02:45.697 --> 02:02:47.918]  Now, of course, if I did this in two years, nobody would care.
[02:02:48.578 --> 02:02:51.620]  So it also ties in to hype.
[02:02:54.457 --> 02:02:59.859]  And so because it had so many issues tied into it, that's why we did it.
[02:03:00.459 --> 02:03:02.920]  And I can't think of better advertising.
[02:03:05.521 --> 02:03:15.464]  Advertising against bad things, against war, against torture, against police state, and against worshipping things.
[02:03:16.877 --> 02:03:19.399]  Now on the other side, it's not just worshipping things.
[02:03:19.439 --> 02:03:20.940]  Some people don't like to waste.
[02:03:21.641 --> 02:03:23.182]  But this is certainly not a waste.
[02:03:23.703 --> 02:03:27.826]  This will be seen by a million people conservatively probably in the next few months, definitely in the next year.
[02:03:29.007 --> 02:03:32.610]  I'm good at guesstimating how many views this will get just on one video.
[02:03:32.650 --> 02:03:33.571]  It'll be copied everywhere.
[02:03:33.811 --> 02:03:34.672]  Probably tens of millions.
[02:03:35.553 --> 02:03:36.754]  You really can't even measure it.
[02:03:38.121 --> 02:03:49.116]  And think of how many people will get a bird's eye view into their mentality and how they can't form relationships with fellow humans and how we're being sucked in to this high-tech matrix.
[02:03:49.557 --> 02:03:54.143]  The average person playing hours of video games every day, four and a half hours of TV.
[02:03:55.445 --> 02:03:57.166]  Young people aren't even communicating with each other.
[02:03:57.186 --> 02:03:58.426]  They're just texting each other.
[02:03:58.726 --> 02:04:07.369]  If you're wondering what the mystery is, it will soon be revealed for you on the other side of this break.
[02:04:07.389 --> 02:04:10.730]  We're going to come in out of the break.
[02:04:11.670 --> 02:04:14.091]  Some stations join us then, so I'll introduce it briefly.
[02:04:14.111 --> 02:04:23.394]  Then we're going to play this 10-minute video premiere here at PrisonPlanet.tv and on the syndicated radio broadcast.
[02:04:24.372 --> 02:04:26.092]  And there's a psychological study here.
[02:04:26.112 --> 02:04:27.313]  There's a psychological test.
[02:04:27.333 --> 02:04:32.294]  That's only... That's only part of it, though.
[02:04:33.294 --> 02:04:35.594]  This is also a mass psychology test.
[02:04:36.214 --> 02:04:44.616]  A group psychology experiment that we are all about to take part in, straight ahead, on the other side.
[02:04:44.636 --> 02:04:45.676]  This is gonna make a hubbub.
[02:04:46.596 --> 02:04:49.837]  And it shouldn't make a hubbub, but because of the mind control, it will.
[02:04:52.165 --> 02:04:54.768]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:04:55.169 --> 02:05:00.135]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:05:00.495 --> 02:05:02.238]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:05:02.558 --> 02:05:07.364]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:05:07.564 --> 02:05:08.506]  How much do you want?
[02:05:08.746 --> 02:05:09.467]  When do you want it?
[02:05:09.847 --> 02:05:11.449]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:05:11.729 --> 02:05:12.550]  When will you need it?
[02:05:12.811 --> 02:05:14.873]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:05:15.013 --> 02:05:16.115]  Will there be any food?
[02:05:16.355 --> 02:05:17.677]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:05:17.877 --> 02:05:22.943]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:05:23.143 --> 02:05:26.267]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:05:26.707 --> 02:05:30.209]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:05:30.529 --> 02:05:31.529]  How much will you need?
[02:05:31.770 --> 02:05:32.370]  We don't know.
[02:05:32.670 --> 02:05:33.570]  How much do you want?
[02:05:33.771 --> 02:05:34.491]  All you can get.
[02:05:34.511 --> 02:05:35.551]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:35.792 --> 02:05:38.553]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:05:38.853 --> 02:05:40.594]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:05:40.614 --> 02:05:41.554]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:52.521]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:52.561 --> 02:05:57.905]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:05:58.165 --> 02:06:02.769]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:06:03.169 --> 02:06:03.549]  It's true.
[02:06:03.649 --> 02:06:06.251]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[02:06:06.471 --> 02:06:08.213]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:06:08.753 --> 02:06:13.438]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:06:13.979 --> 02:06:15.901]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[02:06:16.281 --> 02:06:20.907]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:06:21.087 --> 02:06:21.988]  And here's the best part.
[02:06:22.208 --> 02:06:24.971]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:06:24.991 --> 02:06:28.575]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:06:28.875 --> 02:06:31.716]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:06:32.076 --> 02:06:33.957]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:06:34.297 --> 02:06:35.157]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:06:35.237 --> 02:06:35.537]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:06:35.558 --> 02:06:38.379]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:06:38.879 --> 02:06:40.599]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:06:52.864 --> 02:06:56.485]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:56.805 --> 02:07:04.947]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:07:05.667 --> 02:07:09.728]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:07:10.308 --> 02:07:21.110]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:07:21.750 --> 02:07:30.753]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:31.273 --> 02:07:36.335]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:07:36.695 --> 02:07:43.878]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:44.178 --> 02:07:46.579]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:07:52.148 --> 02:07:57.192]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:07:57.553 --> 02:07:59.895]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:07:59.915 --> 02:08:07.321]  Alright, it is the final hour of this syndicated broadcast.
[02:08:07.601 --> 02:08:14.287]  We are premiering Invisible Empire New Order Defined at PrisonPlanet.TV in 52 minutes at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:08:16.741 --> 02:08:18.983]  Okay, I did a psychological test yesterday.
[02:08:19.003 --> 02:08:21.826]  I shot this video, did this in the office yesterday evening.
[02:08:21.846 --> 02:08:26.091]  Aaron worked very late and then today to put this video together.
[02:08:26.131 --> 02:08:27.252]  Great job to Aaron Dykes.
[02:08:27.712 --> 02:08:33.078]  This is a psychological test and I explain why at the end of the video.
[02:08:33.138 --> 02:08:35.661]  And I predict this will create somewhat of a hubbub.
[02:08:36.061 --> 02:08:37.342]  People are going to be upset by this.
[02:08:38.123 --> 02:08:46.528]  They're not upset by humans being tortured, by war, by police state, by seeing their fellow humans beaten for no reason, because we've been dehumanized.
[02:08:47.208 --> 02:08:53.231]  You see Marines throw a puppy off a cliff, everybody gets upset because we haven't seen millions of simulated murders of animals.
[02:08:54.112 --> 02:08:56.893]  What would happen though if we did it to a computer?
[02:08:57.393 --> 02:09:00.235]  Something new, something trendy, something filled with hype.
[02:09:00.995 --> 02:09:03.397]  Let's go ahead and go to this video.
[02:09:04.137 --> 02:09:05.598]  The torture of an iPod.
[02:09:20.151 --> 02:09:24.854]  Torture!
[02:09:26.455 --> 02:09:28.177]  I was always taught torture was wrong.
[02:09:28.817 --> 02:09:38.163]  But I'm pro-America, and now that they say torture's good, well, I've decided that when in Rome, do as the Romans did.
[02:09:39.123 --> 02:09:42.866]  But humans don't care about seeing other humans tortured.
[02:09:43.735 --> 02:09:44.736]  We've been dehumanized.
[02:09:45.076 --> 02:09:49.942]  They got mad when the Marines threw that puppy off the cliff because people still have empathy for animals.
[02:09:50.522 --> 02:09:52.825]  I thought, what about an iPad?
[02:09:53.506 --> 02:09:54.407]  What is it gonna think?
[02:09:54.907 --> 02:09:57.350]  People love inanimate objects.
[02:09:57.370 --> 02:09:58.050]  They love things.
[02:09:58.070 --> 02:09:59.152]  They love possessions.
[02:09:59.632 --> 02:10:01.214]  They don't get upset by humans being tortured.
[02:10:10.723 --> 02:10:11.103]  Yes!
[02:10:11.524 --> 02:10:12.705]  Naughty little boys!
[02:10:13.025 --> 02:10:18.849]  So I thought, what would happen if we tortured an iPad?
[02:10:20.030 --> 02:10:22.292]  And that's what we're about to do.
[02:10:22.312 --> 02:10:27.816]  Okay, 12 pound sledgehammer.
[02:10:27.836 --> 02:10:32.460]  Make sure this is working.
[02:10:35.171 --> 02:10:37.693]  Just a professional interrogation for America.
[02:10:37.733 --> 02:10:38.893]  What we do, the good guys.
[02:10:39.053 --> 02:10:41.515]  After all, Joseph Mengele wasn't that bad, was he now?
[02:10:41.535 --> 02:10:42.395]  According to our government.
[02:10:42.676 --> 02:10:44.717]  Got the electrical power here.
[02:10:45.157 --> 02:10:50.440]  And of course... Made the USA waterboarding equipment.
[02:10:51.141 --> 02:10:54.563]  We're gonna have a discussion with you, Mr. iPad.
[02:10:55.123 --> 02:10:55.564]  You understand?
[02:10:55.584 --> 02:10:57.485]  And you're gonna answer our questions.
[02:10:58.005 --> 02:10:59.306]  Al Gore's on your board.
[02:10:59.326 --> 02:11:02.728]  And you guys pose as a bunch of egalitarian liberals.
[02:11:03.669 --> 02:11:03.809]  But...
[02:11:04.747 --> 02:11:07.790]  You're made in China by basically slave labor.
[02:11:09.091 --> 02:11:13.516]  Well, Mr. iPad, again I'm gonna ask you, why are you made in China?
[02:11:13.556 --> 02:11:15.838]  This is gonna go on for a long time here.
[02:11:16.298 --> 02:11:17.279]  It's only gonna get rougher.
[02:11:17.439 --> 02:11:17.880]  Oh, you're gonna...
[02:11:19.241 --> 02:11:20.142]  You're going to not respond?
[02:11:20.442 --> 02:11:21.082]  Well, that's fine.
[02:11:21.823 --> 02:11:27.507]  At the end of our little session with the iPad, I'm going to explain exactly why we're doing this in detail.
[02:11:28.047 --> 02:11:29.949]  But overall, it's an important experiment.
[02:11:30.529 --> 02:11:40.096]  We've got all these different implements of torture or enhanced interrogation, but I figured we'd just go ahead and cut right to the chase with the power drill.
[02:11:40.616 --> 02:11:41.557]  Again, one of the tools
[02:11:42.497 --> 02:11:43.957]  Of the CIA.
[02:11:44.338 --> 02:11:48.819]  I've told it to explain to us why it's in league with Al Gore, and it will not answer my question.
[02:11:49.059 --> 02:11:50.559]  We're gonna get really serious right now.
[02:11:50.819 --> 02:11:51.659]  We're gonna get some answers.
[02:12:01.182 --> 02:12:02.982]  Now I'm not even gonna ask you questions.
[02:12:03.382 --> 02:12:06.603]  This is like in Pakistan when a predator drone drops a bomb on a wedding.
[02:12:07.023 --> 02:12:10.044]  Now we're just gonna kill your ass, because that's pro-America!
[02:12:21.929 --> 02:12:23.130]  Answer my questions!
[02:12:23.651 --> 02:12:25.292]  We're the good guys!
[02:12:25.352 --> 02:12:25.792]  We're America!
[02:12:26.013 --> 02:12:28.435]  You will answer our questions!
[02:12:28.495 --> 02:12:29.616]  Torture is good!
[02:12:31.918 --> 02:12:33.239]  I smell China!
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:35.421]  Literally, you can smell it.
[02:12:35.561 --> 02:12:36.562]  Look at that smoke coming out.
[02:12:38.363 --> 02:12:40.305]  Let me get you cleaned up for the next round.
[02:12:42.847 --> 02:12:44.108]  Well, you're still alive.
[02:12:44.148 --> 02:12:45.830]  We've been torturing you for quite a while.
[02:12:45.850 --> 02:12:47.671]  Because again, that's the American way.
[02:12:47.711 --> 02:12:48.272]  That's freedom.
[02:12:49.401 --> 02:12:54.265]  And now we're going to go ahead and put you out of your misery with a firing squad.
[02:12:55.726 --> 02:12:57.547]  So let's put your little blindfold on.
[02:12:59.349 --> 02:13:01.831]  Let's give you a cigarette.
[02:13:02.551 --> 02:13:02.831]  Good.
[02:13:03.092 --> 02:13:09.437]  It's time for the firing squad for high treason.
[02:13:10.529 --> 02:13:12.350]  No judge, no court, no nothing.
[02:13:12.830 --> 02:13:15.032]  Under the Enemy Belligerence Act, now in the U.S.
[02:13:15.072 --> 02:13:18.093]  Senate, we're allowed to arrest you as a U.S.
[02:13:18.133 --> 02:13:22.316]  citizen, torture you, kill you, do whatever we want, because that is freedom.
[02:13:22.356 --> 02:13:23.196]  Enjoy your cigarette.
[02:13:25.177 --> 02:13:26.518]  No trial, no nothing.
[02:13:26.578 --> 02:13:29.980]  Under the USA Patriot Act, iPad, you are terminated.
[02:13:30.180 --> 02:13:32.201]  Ready, aim, fire!
[02:13:34.823 --> 02:13:36.084]  Well, looks like that didn't do it.
[02:13:36.104 --> 02:13:37.625]  We have to shoot you a couple more times here.
[02:13:37.645 --> 02:13:39.686]  This is going to continue for a while here.
[02:13:40.540 --> 02:13:41.901]  I'm doing this because I'm a patriot.
[02:13:42.702 --> 02:13:44.683]  I'm going to take your bank accounts because I'm a patriot.
[02:13:45.084 --> 02:13:46.785]  I'm going to set up checkpoints because I'm a patriot.
[02:13:47.286 --> 02:13:50.989]  Everything I do is because I'm a patriot and you're an evil iPad.
[02:13:53.851 --> 02:13:56.473]  And one more right between the eyes just to get you out of your pain.
[02:13:58.375 --> 02:14:01.017]  And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how we deal with terrorists.
[02:14:01.837 --> 02:14:04.920]  You know, after we torture somebody to death, we've got to get rid of the body.
[02:14:04.940 --> 02:14:05.821]  We've got to dismember it.
[02:14:06.021 --> 02:14:09.484]  So even though the iPad's no longer with us, we've got to get rid of the evidence.
[02:14:14.598 --> 02:14:15.239]  Oh, the guts!
[02:14:18.242 --> 02:14:20.705]  It's almost as funny as one of them dead Iraqi kids.
[02:14:20.725 --> 02:14:27.773]  Oh yeah, look at that, right through the windshield.
[02:14:27.993 --> 02:14:30.075]  Those weapons of mass destruction gotta be somewhere.
[02:14:30.936 --> 02:14:33.038]  It's their fault for bringing their kids to a battle.
[02:14:33.078 --> 02:14:33.839]  That's right.
[02:14:33.879 --> 02:14:35.041]  Nope, no weapons over there.
[02:14:37.415 --> 02:14:39.879]  It's almost as funny as one of them dead Iraqi kids.
[02:14:41.121 --> 02:14:42.182]  Designed in America.
[02:14:43.024 --> 02:14:43.905]  Made in China.
[02:14:44.706 --> 02:14:47.611]  You have just taken part in a psychological test.
[02:14:48.132 --> 02:14:48.612]  A study.
[02:14:49.053 --> 02:14:50.515]  There's a lot of different facets to it.
[02:14:51.624 --> 02:14:53.505]  Number one, I like Apple.
[02:14:53.825 --> 02:14:54.966]  I like the iPad.
[02:14:55.106 --> 02:14:57.067]  We have a couple in the office and I bought one at home.
[02:14:58.028 --> 02:15:01.009]  But I've seen people literally worshipping these machines.
[02:15:01.449 --> 02:15:05.452]  You know, humans don't care about fellow humans anymore, but they care about inanimate objects.
[02:15:06.292 --> 02:15:16.698]  And I said, we ought to do a psychological test to show how people get upset out on the web about watching the video you just saw, but don't care about Iraqi kids in a minivan being murdered in front of everybody.
[02:15:17.358 --> 02:15:18.439]  This is the dehumanization.
[02:15:18.499 --> 02:15:30.824]  We saw that a year ago when the Marines threw the puppy off the cliff, and it was admitted the Marines had done it, and the Marine Corps admitted they'd done it, and actually kicked him out of the Corps, but people were still living in denial, saying, no, the Marines didn't kill that puppy, it's too evil.
[02:15:31.404 --> 02:15:34.025]  See, Iraqis are dehumanized, but the puppy, it matters.
[02:15:34.746 --> 02:15:44.130]  Well, the puppy matters a hell of a lot more than this iPad did, and over a million Iraqis in the last seven years have been killed conservatively, and their society was wrecked like this iPad.
[02:15:44.930 --> 02:15:46.652]  And so that's one reason I did this.
[02:15:47.453 --> 02:15:57.403]  I also wanted to show, and I'll guarantee in the comments below this YouTube video you'll see it, that people are going to be angry that I did this, because they associate it with a living thing.
[02:15:58.124 --> 02:16:03.229]  And in the future, computers may become artificially intelligent, like Isaac Asimov talked about 60 years ago.
[02:16:03.349 --> 02:16:05.351]  There'll be laws against doing this to computers.
[02:16:06.132 --> 02:16:13.280]  That shows how twisted our worldview has gotten, where we've been trained by the eugenicists, environmentalists, that human life means nothing.
[02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:15.302]  But I do want to add something here.
[02:16:15.362 --> 02:16:16.663]  I don't believe in reincarnation.
[02:16:17.604 --> 02:16:20.187]  Not in animal life, not in human life.
[02:16:20.307 --> 02:16:22.849]  But in the case of this iPad, it did not die.
[02:16:23.917 --> 02:16:28.879]  Its consciousness, or all of its programs and apps, are downloaded onto computers over there.
[02:16:28.919 --> 02:16:30.060]  We've already bought a replacement.
[02:16:30.700 --> 02:16:37.503]  And so, literally, the data that was in this iPod will repossess and will enter the body of a new iPad.
[02:16:37.663 --> 02:16:46.948]  But Iraqi civilization, and many other civilizations, many areas of Serbia, have been reduced to rubble that resembles this pile of junk.
[02:16:47.688 --> 02:16:49.409]  Then, of course, there's another facet.
[02:16:50.229 --> 02:17:00.495]  Apple claims they're all liberal and trendy and care about humanity, but Al Gore, who wants to put carbon taxes that will reduce world population in place, is on their board.
[02:17:00.995 --> 02:17:05.718]  And Apple pushes all of this anti-private property rights, anti-human propaganda.
[02:17:06.238 --> 02:17:11.821]  And so I guess it makes sense that they have giant factories with people working for slave wages all over China.
[02:17:12.081 --> 02:17:14.342]  Oh yeah, designed in America, made in China.
[02:17:14.963 --> 02:17:18.405]  And the people there are being paid so little they can't ever afford to buy.
[02:17:19.005 --> 02:17:19.485]  An iPad.
[02:17:19.765 --> 02:17:21.946]  And so there's also a lot of hypocrisy there.
[02:17:22.506 --> 02:17:25.106]  I think technology's great, but it's a double-edged sword.
[02:17:25.487 --> 02:17:27.907]  It can be used as a tool for good or for bad.
[02:17:28.687 --> 02:17:36.789]  But for those of you out there that were upset by seeing this happen, or think it was wasteful, 500 bucks, this'll probably get a million views in the next year.
[02:17:37.069 --> 02:17:42.130]  And we'll educate thousands and thousands of people that watch it who will get what we did here today.
[02:17:42.510 --> 02:17:44.591]  And then of course there's the subject of torture itself.
[02:17:45.828 --> 02:17:54.492]  The Army's own report, the Toogoomba report, admitted they were raping children, torturing people with battery acid, with drills, torturing people's children in front of them.
[02:17:55.052 --> 02:18:04.176]  Those are human beings, ladies and gentlemen, and are a trillion times more important than this iPad that the mind of man created.
[02:18:04.536 --> 02:18:06.477]  Man is the greatest species on this planet.
[02:18:06.817 --> 02:18:08.438]  Man is reaching towards the stars.
[02:18:09.369 --> 02:18:18.075]  We also need to be wary of the future of technology, lest it supplant humanity and be used by a technocratic elite to set up a prison planet.
[02:18:18.335 --> 02:18:26.260]  The elite have written many white papers stating that because they have robotics and automation, they don't need a large population anymore.
[02:18:26.360 --> 02:18:37.148]  That's why Bill Joy back in 2000 wrote the article, Why the Future Doesn't Need Us, and discussed the fact that the elite are seriously considering exterminating the majority of the world population.
[02:18:37.888 --> 02:18:38.569]  I know a lot of you
[02:18:39.389 --> 02:18:42.690]  You went to college and you believe in the people bomb and you believe there's too many people.
[02:18:43.331 --> 02:18:46.512]  The problem is you don't understand that you're in the crosshairs of the elite as well.
[02:18:46.912 --> 02:18:54.496]  And machines are being used as one of the major tools to control us, to track us, to predict our movements, to predict our very thoughts.
[02:18:55.396 --> 02:19:00.298]  And so it's important to keep technology on a very short leash.
[02:19:00.818 --> 02:19:01.699]  Lest it be used
[02:19:03.220 --> 02:19:03.861]  To enslave us.
[02:19:04.621 --> 02:19:06.723]  Again, I'm Alex Jones with Infowars.com.
[02:19:06.843 --> 02:19:10.467]  I hope this little presentation has spurred some of you to think.
[02:19:10.907 --> 02:19:17.053]  I hope you'll have lively discussions with your friends and co-workers and neighbors about the torture of an iPad.
[02:19:17.673 --> 02:19:19.094]  Of all the reasons we did this.
[02:19:19.915 --> 02:19:21.655]  Number one is to get you thinking out there.
[02:19:21.715 --> 02:19:24.496]  Many of you can't form relationships with fellow humans now.
[02:19:24.896 --> 02:19:26.597]  You're only forming them with machines.
[02:19:27.017 --> 02:19:28.237]  You're losing your humanity.
[02:19:28.837 --> 02:19:33.358]  The vocabulary of the average American has shrunk by thousands and thousands of words.
[02:19:33.798 --> 02:19:37.839]  And the statistics show it's even getting worse with young people, with teenagers.
[02:19:38.379 --> 02:19:42.020]  You go out to a restaurant, you see all the kids around the table texting their friends.
[02:19:42.420 --> 02:19:45.201]  I love technology, but I also understand the downsides.
[02:19:45.441 --> 02:19:50.218]  We're going to come back and play that last piece by itself, then get into the news and take your phone calls.
[02:19:50.258 --> 02:19:50.700]  Stay with us.
[02:19:54.012 --> 02:19:56.253]  ...and are subject to other police action.
[02:19:56.474 --> 02:19:57.414]  Tyranny is here.
[02:19:57.735 --> 02:20:01.538]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:20:01.618 --> 02:20:03.879]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:20:03.899 --> 02:20:09.344]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:20:09.764 --> 02:20:15.989]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:20:16.429 --> 02:20:21.991]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:20:22.411 --> 02:20:26.092]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:20:26.592 --> 02:20:30.573]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:20:30.873 --> 02:20:36.395]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:20:36.815 --> 02:20:39.936]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:20:40.376 --> 02:20:41.777]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:20:42.337 --> 02:20:42.777]  It's here.

[02:21:51.178 --> 02:22:00.925]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[02:22:01.206 --> 02:22:05.249]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system.
[02:22:05.669 --> 02:22:07.230]  Wisdom being lost with time.
[02:22:07.610 --> 02:22:16.475]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[02:22:16.855 --> 02:22:25.760]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:30.623]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[02:22:31.103 --> 02:22:32.183]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:32.444 --> 02:22:34.945]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[02:22:35.225 --> 02:22:38.387]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[02:22:38.547 --> 02:22:42.370]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.

[02:22:43.470 --> 02:22:43.811]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:51.334 --> 02:22:51.875]  You worry.
[02:22:52.255 --> 02:22:53.996]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[02:22:54.276 --> 02:22:56.518]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[02:22:56.819 --> 02:22:58.660]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[02:22:58.920 --> 02:23:00.121]  Your answer may be at hand.
[02:23:00.522 --> 02:23:03.724]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[02:23:04.124 --> 02:23:08.988]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[02:23:09.369 --> 02:23:12.691]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[02:23:13.172 --> 02:23:14.453]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[02:23:14.853 --> 02:23:17.455]  Wild food grows everywhere, and you will see it everywhere.
[02:23:17.695 --> 02:23:20.657]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[02:23:20.997 --> 02:23:29.163]  Well-respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[02:23:29.443 --> 02:23:33.846]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[02:23:34.146 --> 02:23:37.828]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.
[02:23:38.169 --> 02:23:41.891]  Or if you're not online, call her 24-hour, toll-free order line at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:23:41.911 --> 02:23:42.351]  That number again.
[02:23:45.075 --> 02:23:46.721]  888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:23:46.741 --> 02:23:49.270]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[02:23:49.991 --> 02:23:50.631]  I love an iPad.
[02:23:51.271 --> 02:23:55.272]  Of all the reasons we did this, number one is to get you thinking out there.
[02:23:55.332 --> 02:23:58.113]  Many of you can't form relationships with fellow humans now.
[02:23:58.513 --> 02:24:00.213]  You're only forming them with machines.
[02:24:00.633 --> 02:24:01.873]  You're losing your humanity.
[02:24:02.454 --> 02:24:06.974]  The vocabulary of the average American has shrunk by thousands and thousands of words.
[02:24:07.415 --> 02:24:11.455]  And the statistics show it's even getting worse with young people, with teenagers.
[02:24:11.995 --> 02:24:15.636]  You go out to a restaurant, you see all the kids around the table texting their friends.
[02:24:16.036 --> 02:24:18.837]  I love technology, but I also understand the downsides.
[02:24:19.437 --> 02:24:20.537]  That's why we showed you here.
[02:24:20.957 --> 02:24:22.218]  It isn't machines that matter.
[02:24:22.558 --> 02:24:23.818]  It's the people that built them.
[02:24:24.178 --> 02:24:25.559]  It's this precious species.
[02:24:26.019 --> 02:24:28.139]  Rediscover the power of humanity.
[02:24:31.520 --> 02:24:36.282]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:36.322 --> 02:24:36.602]  Tax Day 2010.
[02:24:36.682 --> 02:24:40.603]  I'm going to take phone calls for the balance of the hour.
[02:24:50.629 --> 02:24:53.229]  We have some other very informative guests joining us tomorrow.
[02:24:53.249 --> 02:24:54.410]  I'll just leave it at that.
[02:24:54.430 --> 02:24:57.210]  But we've had Gerald Cilente on yesterday.
[02:24:57.610 --> 02:25:02.511]  We, of course, today had Lorcas Vermongten last hour and Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:25:02.991 --> 02:25:10.172]  And we have some extremely powerful, important guests covering amazing information, very powerful information tomorrow.
[02:25:10.212 --> 02:25:11.333]  So be sure and join us.
[02:25:11.733 --> 02:25:19.494]  We do have the premiere coming up in T-minus 35 minutes at PrisonPlanet.tv in what, five different formats?
[02:25:20.936 --> 02:25:28.579]  High-quality Flash, QuickTime, DivX, a bunch of others at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:34.342]  Film 18 months in the making, premiering in T-minus 35 minutes.
[02:25:34.562 --> 02:25:35.942]  We are go, Houston, right?
[02:25:36.423 --> 02:25:38.083]  We are go, my IT guys in there?
[02:25:38.123 --> 02:25:39.304]  We are go, video crew?
[02:25:39.324 --> 02:25:41.065]  We are go, go, go!
[02:25:41.085 --> 02:25:43.286]  InfoWars is go, go, go!
[02:25:43.606 --> 02:25:46.047]  Launch weapon systems, launch, launch!
[02:25:47.332 --> 02:25:52.194]  It'll be up at PrisonPlanet.tv in T-minus 34 minutes.
[02:25:52.214 --> 02:25:54.574]  34-minute countdown.
[02:25:55.034 --> 02:26:00.256]  This is Cape Canaveral Launch Center preparing to initiate final countdown in sequence.
[02:26:02.117 --> 02:26:03.177]  Launch is go.
[02:26:03.437 --> 02:26:04.397]  Launch is go.
[02:26:04.738 --> 02:26:05.698]  Houston is go.
[02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:16.443]  I'll tell you, we make films that get seen conservatively tens of millions of times per film, and it's my enjoyment to fight tyranny.
[02:26:16.463 --> 02:26:17.323]  It feels good.
[02:26:17.363 --> 02:26:19.464]  It's like when you lance a pus-filled boil.
[02:26:19.844 --> 02:26:22.866]  It's gross, but it's satisfying because the pus is getting out.
[02:26:23.546 --> 02:26:25.647]  And it's scary to know this stuff.
[02:26:25.707 --> 02:26:26.967]  It's scary to face the truth.
[02:26:27.007 --> 02:26:32.069]  But, I don't know, what's that Patrick Henry quote of, I will know the whole of the truth.
[02:26:32.129 --> 02:26:34.450]  I will know the horrible truth and make provision for it.
[02:26:36.184 --> 02:26:39.026]  I know there's some timid souls out there that don't want to know the truth.
[02:26:39.066 --> 02:26:40.487]  Forget that you are our brethren.
[02:26:41.608 --> 02:26:42.709]  Go from us in peace.
[02:26:42.809 --> 02:26:46.051]  Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you.
[02:26:46.732 --> 02:26:50.514]  But as for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:26:51.976 --> 02:26:58.540]  So again, we're going to intersperse a lot of key news, some top stories, recap here in this hour, and your phone calls.
[02:26:58.780 --> 02:27:00.662]  Let's go to Christopher in Arizona right now.
[02:27:01.082 --> 02:27:02.023]  Christopher, welcome.
[02:27:03.595 --> 02:27:04.115]  Hello, Alex.
[02:27:04.135 --> 02:27:04.495]  How are you?
[02:27:04.916 --> 02:27:05.256]  Good, sir.
[02:27:05.296 --> 02:27:06.936]  What do you think of the murder of the iPad?
[02:27:08.717 --> 02:27:10.178]  Oh, how could you do that?
[02:27:10.718 --> 02:27:11.679]  It's our God.
[02:27:11.739 --> 02:27:12.539]  We worship it.
[02:27:12.599 --> 02:27:13.399]  We live by it.
[02:27:13.539 --> 02:27:15.840]  It tells us what to do, what to buy, what to watch.
[02:27:16.181 --> 02:27:18.742]  It tracks us, and so Big Brother knows we're safe.
[02:27:19.582 --> 02:27:20.743]  It should take care of you, though.
[02:27:22.403 --> 02:27:24.264]  Well, I have a few questions, actually.
[02:27:24.744 --> 02:27:25.184]  Go ahead.
[02:27:27.385 --> 02:27:33.108]  Well, if we, like, say down the road, you know, we try to resist the carbon tax, blah, blah, blah.
[02:27:33.624 --> 02:27:35.485]  Which, you know, John McCain is for.
[02:27:37.766 --> 02:27:46.631]  Do you think there's a possibility that they could use NORTHCOM troops, possibly with UN troops, to enforce that under that law?
[02:27:47.151 --> 02:27:47.571]  Was it 87-297?
[02:27:47.731 --> 02:27:50.013]  Say that again?
[02:27:51.033 --> 02:27:51.854]  To enforce what?
[02:27:53.194 --> 02:27:56.256]  To enforce complying with the carbon tax, like if people resist.
[02:27:57.870 --> 02:28:04.015]  Oh absolutely, but instead they're just saying the EPA, separate from Congress, can do whatever it wants.
[02:28:04.676 --> 02:28:12.763]  And of course the Constitution says Congress makes the laws, and it's the power, and then the executive executes it.
[02:28:13.123 --> 02:28:16.106]  And so that's upside down, or butt backwards as they say.
[02:28:16.146 --> 02:28:18.748]  They have a more graphic way of saying it.
[02:28:19.569 --> 02:28:22.512]  But we're a family show here, broadcast.
[02:28:23.332 --> 02:28:26.033]  But absolutely, everything's being done by executive fiat.
[02:28:26.313 --> 02:28:27.433]  But not just at the federal level.
[02:28:27.473 --> 02:28:30.514]  States, cities, counties are acting like a bunch of brigands.
[02:28:31.014 --> 02:28:34.555]  And we've got to stand up to the thugs and say, you are not my owner.
[02:28:35.055 --> 02:28:35.956]  I am not a slave.
[02:28:37.196 --> 02:28:41.037]  Yeah, well, you know, the Constitution is just a dang piece of paper anyways, right?
[02:28:41.724 --> 02:28:44.447]  Well, that is what congressmen are now saying on video.
[02:28:44.507 --> 02:28:51.613]  That congressman, what, last week from Illinois, on video, says he doesn't care about it.
[02:28:52.254 --> 02:28:54.596]  And George Bush said it's a GD piece of paper.
[02:28:55.056 --> 02:28:55.257]  Right.
[02:28:55.377 --> 02:28:56.197]  And we have to remember that.
[02:28:56.257 --> 02:28:59.781]  Everything Obama's executing is all part of the same plan Bush was executing.
[02:29:00.121 --> 02:29:01.743]  And the same plan Clinton was executing.
[02:29:02.143 --> 02:29:05.226]  Because these politicians come and go, the globalists are there running it.
[02:29:06.607 --> 02:29:06.747]  Right.
[02:29:06.967 --> 02:29:10.551]  And I wanted to share a police state experience with you, if I could, real quick.
[02:29:10.571 --> 02:29:11.131]  Sure, real fast.
[02:29:11.151 --> 02:29:11.812]  Christopher, go ahead.
[02:29:12.833 --> 02:29:13.934]  Okay, well, I was coming to work.
[02:29:13.974 --> 02:29:16.757]  I work on a military base, and I was coming through the main gate.
[02:29:17.878 --> 02:29:22.923]  And, you know, I went through, got to my shop, and then I get a...
[02:29:23.641 --> 02:29:27.384]  I get called into the office by my supervisor and he asks... Tell you what, stay there.
[02:29:27.424 --> 02:29:29.446]  We're going to come back to Christopher to finish the story.
[02:29:29.686 --> 02:29:34.349]  Then Justin, Lynn, Rob, Brian, and others, and a news blitz as well.
[02:29:35.170 --> 02:29:37.632]  It's the day you pay the Federal Reserve your money.
[02:29:37.692 --> 02:29:40.855]  It's the day you bend over and the globalists have their way with you.
[02:29:42.096 --> 02:29:43.016]  We're on the march.
[02:29:43.497 --> 02:29:45.098]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:46.019 --> 02:29:48.701]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:55.669 --> 02:29:56.570]  Tyranny is here.
[02:29:56.930 --> 02:30:00.493]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:30:00.853 --> 02:30:03.095]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:30:03.255 --> 02:30:08.539]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:30:08.959 --> 02:30:15.204]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:30:15.624 --> 02:30:21.146]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:30:21.607 --> 02:30:25.288]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:30:25.768 --> 02:30:29.770]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:30:30.070 --> 02:30:35.892]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:30:36.012 --> 02:30:38.934]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:30:39.554 --> 02:30:40.974]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:30:41.535 --> 02:30:41.975]  It's here.

[02:30:51.760 --> 02:30:57.142]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:30:58.403 --> 02:31:03.165]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:31:03.546 --> 02:31:10.249]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:31:12.270 --> 02:31:14.494]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:31:14.594 --> 02:31:18.662]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[02:31:20.769 --> 02:31:24.632]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:31:25.352 --> 02:31:28.475]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[02:31:29.175 --> 02:31:30.016]  Others don't.
[02:31:30.416 --> 02:31:32.317]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:31:32.557 --> 02:31:34.079]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[02:31:34.359 --> 02:31:36.921]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:31:37.241 --> 02:31:43.485]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:31:43.865 --> 02:31:46.067]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:31:46.567 --> 02:31:48.609]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[02:31:48.929 --> 02:31:49.449]  Others don't.
[02:31:51.616 --> 02:31:58.221]  Silver.com believes, as the Declaration of Independence states, that our rights come from God, not from government.
[02:31:58.401 --> 02:32:07.327]  The only lawful purpose of any government is to protect and secure the rights of the people, and no man or government has the authority to take what has been given to us by God.
[02:32:07.588 --> 02:32:10.770]  Among these rights are life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:32:11.150 --> 02:32:15.931]  America's government has ceased to be the protector of liberty and of the people's God-given rights.
[02:32:16.171 --> 02:32:22.933]  But we, the people, can return America to greatness if we are willing to stand up and reassert our stolen rights.
[02:32:23.373 --> 02:32:27.254]  We ask that you join Utopia Silver in changing America's course in history.
[02:32:27.334 --> 02:32:31.555]  To save on health care and improve your health, call Utopia Silver at 888-213-4338.
[02:32:32.115 --> 02:32:38.336]  For a limited time, new customers will receive 50% off all colloidal silver and colloidal gold supplements.
[02:32:38.516 --> 02:32:40.938]  Visit us today at utopiasilver.com.
[02:32:40.998 --> 02:32:42.799]  That's U-T-O-P-I-A silver.
[02:32:42.980 --> 02:32:44.401]  Utopiasilver.com.
[02:32:44.521 --> 02:32:44.881]  Or call 888-213-4338.
[02:32:44.901 --> 02:32:45.221]  That's 888-213-4338.
[02:33:06.880 --> 02:33:22.471]  Before I go back to Christopher, Justin, Lynn, Rob, Brian and others and get to a bunch of important news interspersed, I want to give a program note for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers that are watching us live and are going to be watching Invisible Empire coming up here in about 30 minutes at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:33:23.132 --> 02:33:25.373]  This has happened the last few films we launch.
[02:33:25.413 --> 02:33:32.679]  We have CDNs, several CDNs, so there's never a problem serving out thousands of copies of the film in the first hour when people hit it.
[02:33:33.772 --> 02:33:43.317]  But the static site is on one server, and it's a beefy server, but it always gets sluggish or shuts down when we have the big, dynamic, fancy site.
[02:33:43.397 --> 02:33:48.900]  So for a day or so, when we do launch a new film, we go to a plan B, and we're setting that up right now.
[02:33:49.240 --> 02:33:50.601]  Be ready in the next 30 minutes.
[02:33:51.721 --> 02:34:01.526]  We're just a static page with a member login, passcode, and Wes, make sure there's a sign-in page, too, on that, or get McAdoo to do that, because that's important.
[02:34:04.895 --> 02:34:21.163]  And once that happens, people will be able to go into those boxes and just put your username, passcode, or sign in, and then you'll just have right there on the front page is all the different versions of the film for anybody that wants to be able to see it.
[02:34:21.683 --> 02:34:23.144]  Anybody that wants to be able to
[02:34:25.871 --> 02:34:26.352]  Download it.
[02:34:26.592 --> 02:34:30.636]  We're going to have downloads of it, streams, flash, a whole bunch of different formats.
[02:34:31.016 --> 02:34:31.837]  They're all there.
[02:34:31.857 --> 02:34:33.438]  And that only usually happens for a few hours.
[02:34:33.498 --> 02:34:35.861]  Everybody hits it and wants it right at once.
[02:34:36.761 --> 02:34:37.983]  So that is going on.
[02:34:39.744 --> 02:34:41.446]  But again, I want to go back to your phone calls.
[02:34:42.167 --> 02:34:45.329]  Invisible Empire No More Defined premiering today in about 30 minutes.
[02:34:45.670 --> 02:34:48.472]  And then next Wednesday, Police Day 4, The Rise of FEMA, my new film.
[02:34:49.213 --> 02:34:50.294]  Let's go ahead and
[02:34:51.957 --> 02:34:54.198]  Go ahead and take another phone call here.
[02:34:54.579 --> 02:35:02.043]  Let's go back to Christopher who was telling a story in Arizona about he works on a military base, he drives through the gate, goes into the shop where he's working.
[02:35:03.084 --> 02:35:04.385]  Please continue, Christopher.
[02:35:05.706 --> 02:35:20.335]  Yes, well my supervisor basically told me that there's a federal agent, some type of investigator, who came in behind me and he'd called our higher-ups and told them, so they, you know, crap rolls downhill, so then it came to me.
[02:35:21.038 --> 02:35:29.865]  But basically it's because I have your, uh, you know, 9-11 was an inside job bumper sticker and live free or die on my, uh, on the back of my Durango.
[02:35:30.045 --> 02:35:31.886]  And I guess he's pulling it right behind me.
[02:35:32.487 --> 02:35:36.530]  And he saw that and, you know, he had to, he had to stop Al-Qaeda, so he called my shop.
[02:35:37.330 --> 02:35:38.211]  I just wanted to share that.
[02:35:38.712 --> 02:35:47.999]  Well, we get reports, and some of it's come out in the newspaper, where, uh, one famous case that was in the news several times, uh, Kelly Rushing.
[02:35:49.372 --> 02:35:52.393]  In, uh, Lyon County, Kentucky.
[02:35:53.053 --> 02:35:53.933]  It was in the newspaper.
[02:35:54.013 --> 02:35:57.734]  He was calling me, telling me, and I couldn't believe the story.
[02:35:57.774 --> 02:35:58.734]  Well-spoken guy.
[02:35:59.455 --> 02:36:01.455]  He was putting two films on one VHS tape.
[02:36:01.595 --> 02:36:03.216]  This was about six years ago.
[02:36:03.796 --> 02:36:05.916]  Ron Paul's neocon speech.
[02:36:05.936 --> 02:36:07.777]  It was about 45 minutes on the floor of Congress.
[02:36:07.837 --> 02:36:08.477]  Very powerful.
[02:36:08.877 --> 02:36:12.038]  Exposing how they're a bunch of Trotskyites on record.
[02:36:12.678 --> 02:36:13.798]  The main Republican leadership.
[02:36:13.838 --> 02:36:14.998]  I mean, that's really true, folks.
[02:36:15.379 --> 02:36:16.419]  Google Trotskyites.
[02:36:18.749 --> 02:36:21.630]  And Neocons, and you'll get Toronto Star Associated Press.
[02:36:22.350 --> 02:36:23.270]  It's very, very sick.
[02:36:23.290 --> 02:36:24.570]  That's how they took conservatives over.
[02:36:25.130 --> 02:36:30.431]  That was the first part, and Road to Tyranny was on the second part on the slow play on the VHS tapes.
[02:36:30.451 --> 02:36:32.212]  It was about four hours of video on there.
[02:36:32.872 --> 02:36:34.632]  And he gave hundreds of these out in the community.
[02:36:35.433 --> 02:36:37.593]  And back then, I was still naive six years ago.
[02:36:37.613 --> 02:36:46.935]  It's not that I didn't believe him, but I got in the phone book at my house and started calling people with the name Rushing.
[02:36:48.505 --> 02:36:51.807]  And they're like, yeah, no, that's my cousin, or no, that's my brother.
[02:36:51.827 --> 02:36:57.571]  Then I randomly called people on the same streets, and they said, oh, sure, that's a great family here in town.
[02:36:57.611 --> 02:37:00.572]  Kelly's a wonderful, upstanding member of the community and church and everything.
[02:37:00.993 --> 02:37:02.414]  And I'd say, have you heard about his arrest?
[02:37:02.474 --> 02:37:03.654]  Yes, we saw it in the paper.
[02:37:04.275 --> 02:37:05.215]  And I went in the paper.
[02:37:06.796 --> 02:37:14.381]  And so then I went and looked that up, and there it was in the Lyon County paper that he saw a state police officer.
[02:37:16.255 --> 02:37:19.496]  And drove up to him and said, sir, this is a video about what's happening to our country.
[02:37:20.596 --> 02:37:25.137]  And the police officer then found his address off of his license plate and his name.
[02:37:27.018 --> 02:37:32.659]  When he pulled out of his house, got him, arrested him, put him in the back, called his wife and laughed and said, I have the VHS bandit with me.
[02:37:33.459 --> 02:37:34.659]  And Kelly said, why are you doing this?
[02:37:34.679 --> 02:37:36.840]  And he said, that's an anti-law enforcement video.
[02:37:36.860 --> 02:37:38.320]  You're not allowed to give that out in America.
[02:37:39.601 --> 02:37:40.781]  And I couldn't believe this.
[02:37:40.801 --> 02:37:41.601]  This was in the paper.
[02:37:41.641 --> 02:37:42.801]  And they charged him.
[02:37:43.922 --> 02:37:44.782]  They charged him
[02:37:45.956 --> 02:37:46.877]  Two different counts.
[02:37:48.879 --> 02:37:50.981]  The Ron Paul video, he was charged.
[02:37:51.001 --> 02:37:53.664]  You're not allowed to give people a video of C-SPAN.
[02:37:53.684 --> 02:37:56.246]  I mean, this happened.
[02:37:57.087 --> 02:38:03.354]  And he was charged for terroristic threats for that and terroristic threats against law enforcement for road to tyranny that has no threats in it.
[02:38:04.406 --> 02:38:30.931]  And I got the judge's number, called his home, had it on speaker, my wife's sitting there, so the judge didn't make something up, and I said, hello sir, hello your honor, this is Alex Jones, I'm a radio talk show host, I saw this in the newspaper, is it true, and I've since seen this countless times, that you've arrested Kelly Rushing, and next week is his trial, and you're gonna have this trial go forward, a jury trial, and he's facing five years in prison, and he said, yes, but I'm not gonna talk about the trial with you.
[02:38:31.451 --> 02:38:32.251]  And it went to trial,
[02:38:34.685 --> 02:38:36.486]  And he was found not guilty by the jury.
[02:38:37.346 --> 02:38:38.427]  They weren't that brainwashed.
[02:38:39.027 --> 02:38:42.209]  And then a week later, he was driving home and the police pulled him over.
[02:38:42.309 --> 02:38:43.370]  By the way, he didn't drink.
[02:38:43.990 --> 02:38:45.411]  They laughed at him.
[02:38:45.431 --> 02:38:47.432]  The state police did and said, we're arresting you for drinking.
[02:38:47.932 --> 02:38:50.073]  These are warped individuals, folks.
[02:38:50.233 --> 02:38:50.634]  Warped.
[02:38:51.417 --> 02:39:02.625]  And I have the footage in Road to Tyranny, that very video, where state police in Virginia, in a rural area, pull over Abby Newman, naval veteran, no criminal record, in town buying canning supplies.
[02:39:03.085 --> 02:39:04.166]  She's at a warrantless checkpoint.
[02:39:04.206 --> 02:39:05.787]  She says, you're not going to search my car without a warrant.
[02:39:06.067 --> 02:39:08.208]  They get her out, put her in handcuffs, open the back up.
[02:39:08.568 --> 02:39:10.730]  They find a Patriot Games with Harrison Ford.
[02:39:10.750 --> 02:39:11.671]  They get scared of that.
[02:39:11.971 --> 02:39:13.132]  The word Patriot scared them.
[02:39:13.412 --> 02:39:14.292]  This is on video.
[02:39:14.853 --> 02:39:16.794]  They find a Police State 2000 video.
[02:39:17.134 --> 02:39:17.795]  They get scared.
[02:39:17.815 --> 02:39:19.476]  And then they find a pocket Constitution.
[02:39:19.956 --> 02:39:20.877]  And the state police
[02:39:21.877 --> 02:39:24.159]  It's about two hours into the almost three hour film.
[02:39:24.999 --> 02:39:25.540]  Road to Tyranny.
[02:39:26.220 --> 02:39:31.503]  They start, oh, oh, they start making, oh, oh, I can't believe she's got this.
[02:39:31.543 --> 02:39:32.404]  Is she allowed?
[02:39:32.464 --> 02:39:33.324]  Do we arrest her?
[02:39:33.865 --> 02:39:39.048]  And the commander comes over and they go, it may be illegal or she may be allowed to have this.
[02:39:40.430 --> 02:39:42.452]  And they're sitting there on squad car video.
[02:39:42.472 --> 02:39:43.814]  I mean, it's Orwellian.
[02:39:44.275 --> 02:39:45.216]  It's like a joke.
[02:39:45.516 --> 02:39:46.838]  It's absurdist.
[02:39:47.679 --> 02:39:48.760]  Like you're on another planet.
[02:39:49.180 --> 02:39:51.283]  Going, I don't know, she's one of them.
[02:39:51.303 --> 02:39:55.288]  And they're like, you're under arrest for contraband.
[02:39:58.234 --> 02:40:02.658]  I mean, they're literally making noises like, we got one with the Constitution.
[02:40:03.279 --> 02:40:06.222]  It's the scariest thing I've ever seen.
[02:40:06.242 --> 02:40:07.523]  We ought to actually queue the video up.
[02:40:07.543 --> 02:40:08.564]  The show's almost over.
[02:40:08.584 --> 02:40:09.325]  I want to go to some calls.
[02:40:09.365 --> 02:40:12.308]  But you can't believe it till you see it.
[02:40:13.229 --> 02:40:15.731]  And they arrested her and charged her, and she went to court.
[02:40:15.791 --> 02:40:19.896]  And they got up there and said, we got pocket constitutions, your honor.
[02:40:20.646 --> 02:40:22.870]  The judge is like, this actually happened.
[02:40:22.890 --> 02:40:25.996]  It was like, well that's what you swear an oath to and they threw it out.
[02:40:27.018 --> 02:40:29.181]  But not in Lyon County, Kentucky.
[02:40:31.570 --> 02:40:34.071]  I mean, they had the trial.
[02:40:34.771 --> 02:40:37.352]  They'll take your property, they'll take your guns in a minute, folks.
[02:40:37.472 --> 02:40:39.373]  I mean, they are ready to go after the American people.
[02:40:39.653 --> 02:40:44.515]  Now, there are a lot of cops that are salt of the earth and aren't like that, but more and more, they're just lunatics.
[02:40:44.595 --> 02:40:45.976]  I mean, nuttier than a fruitcake.
[02:40:46.336 --> 02:40:51.138]  So what did your supervisor do to you, or is that caller already gone in Arizona?
[02:40:53.119 --> 02:40:54.919]  Christopher, tell us exactly what happened.
[02:40:55.760 --> 02:40:57.881]  So, I mean, did your supervisor, is he going to fire you?
[02:40:57.941 --> 02:41:00.021]  Or, I mean, you're not allowed to have free speech?
[02:41:00.141 --> 02:41:01.182]  I mean, what's going on?
[02:41:02.136 --> 02:41:03.037]  No, nothing like that.
[02:41:03.117 --> 02:41:11.644]  Well, one, you know, first of all, that agent, he didn't have, you know, the sense of courage and duty to question me himself.
[02:41:11.684 --> 02:41:17.228]  He just, you know, like a little coward, you know, a little tail between the legs, called my shop, you know, and I never saw him.
[02:41:17.328 --> 02:41:19.030]  I didn't even know he was behind me.
[02:41:19.750 --> 02:41:27.837]  But it was just, my supervisor, he was cool about it, you know, he just said... So what agent, I mean, an agent of what called you?
[02:41:29.255 --> 02:41:32.858]  I'm not sure what he was, but it's some type of federal investigator.
[02:41:32.898 --> 02:41:38.342]  They come on post, you know, every now and then to do, you know, their little investigation, whatever they do.
[02:41:38.362 --> 02:41:38.902]  I'm not sure.
[02:41:40.163 --> 02:41:41.384]  Well, let me just add to that.
[02:41:41.404 --> 02:41:42.665]  I mean, let me just add to that.
[02:41:45.987 --> 02:41:51.331]  They are now teaching police and military that even American flag bumper stickers are bad.
[02:41:51.351 --> 02:41:52.672]  Did you see that in the MIAC report?
[02:41:53.973 --> 02:41:55.354]  I've read about that, yes.
[02:41:56.169 --> 02:41:57.790]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[02:41:58.310 --> 02:41:58.990]  It's disgusting.
[02:41:59.470 --> 02:42:00.851]  Well, they would just love to arrest you.
[02:42:00.871 --> 02:42:02.911]  I mean, they, they, they, this, they're scum.
[02:42:04.072 --> 02:42:11.974]  That's why I, you know, I rarely go over the speed limit, because once they get you in that system, you're there, and you can't get out, you know, without a hard, hard struggle.
[02:42:14.195 --> 02:42:15.655]  Absolutely, I appreciate it.
[02:42:15.675 --> 02:42:15.996]  Go ahead.
[02:42:17.056 --> 02:42:23.318]  Well, I just wanted to, uh, point out, uh, a ban to you that, you know, you might play on your show during the intermissions.
[02:42:24.620 --> 02:42:24.940]  Okay.
[02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:26.181]  It's a metal band.
[02:42:26.221 --> 02:42:27.621]  You ever hear of Fear Factory?
[02:42:28.642 --> 02:42:29.222]  No, I haven't.
[02:42:29.242 --> 02:42:29.942]  I'll have to check it out.
[02:42:29.982 --> 02:42:31.363]  Thank you, Christopher.
[02:42:31.383 --> 02:42:32.163]  I appreciate your call.
[02:42:32.223 --> 02:42:33.084]  Justin in California.
[02:42:33.104 --> 02:42:33.864]  We gotta move quick now.
[02:42:33.884 --> 02:42:34.484]  I'm long-winded.
[02:42:34.984 --> 02:42:35.685]  Justin, go ahead.
[02:42:36.065 --> 02:42:36.685]  Hello there.
[02:42:36.885 --> 02:42:38.986]  I saw your iPad mental video.
[02:42:39.206 --> 02:42:39.586]  You're right.
[02:42:39.606 --> 02:42:41.107]  You're gonna have millions of viewers on that one.
[02:42:42.828 --> 02:42:43.608]  We've talked before.
[02:42:43.668 --> 02:42:44.849]  I'm a fellow broadcaster here.
[02:42:45.309 --> 02:42:52.632]  A couple weeks ago, a thought came into my mind, and I gotta tell you, I was delighted yesterday when I heard you say that there's a war going on between truth and lies.
[02:42:53.493 --> 02:42:57.138]  If you'll bear with me for 90 seconds, I've got something that was given to me I'll share with you.
[02:42:57.158 --> 02:42:57.959]  Here we go.
[02:42:57.979 --> 02:42:58.279]  Go ahead.
[02:42:59.100 --> 02:43:07.471]  Even though I'm against overtaxing the people of America, I've come up with a tax that will not only save America, but it'll change the whole world for the better when initiated globally.
[02:43:07.871 --> 02:43:09.533]  I call it the Truth Tax.
[02:43:10.624 --> 02:43:13.949]  The truth tax will be focused only on the mentally corrupt politicians.
[02:43:14.550 --> 02:43:26.148]  This new tax would demand a $10,000 truth tax fee be paid by all local, state, and federal government officials and their representatives every time they knowingly tell a lie to the citizens of America.
[02:43:26.648 --> 02:43:42.394]  Now I know without any doubt when the True Tax is initiated with a one-year retroactive rule, that instantly the True Tax would accumulate enough money to pay off all of the 28 trillion dollar debt our political leaders have created using lies to steal the wealth of the citizens of America.
[02:43:43.041 --> 02:43:52.368]  Now, a new collection agency will need to be created called the GEA, or Get Even Agents, will be used to monitor and collect the truth facts from deceptive politicians.
[02:43:53.009 --> 02:44:05.619]  The GEA team should be created by hiring homeless veterans and training them to monitor and find the very same politicians who shoved them into unauthorized wars and left real American heroes homeless on the streets.
[02:44:06.179 --> 02:44:12.782]  Please email all government reps and take the time to send a letter to all of them with tell the truth written on the outside of the letter.
[02:44:13.262 --> 02:44:24.907]  If we all send letters through the mail with tell the truth written on them, we will fill up the mail rooms of all government reps and they'll get a clear message that the American people demand the truth from our government now.
[02:44:25.427 --> 02:44:28.849]  The truth tax, when initiated, will save America from falling into hell.
[02:44:29.289 --> 02:44:31.730]  All Americans must demand the truth tax now.
[02:44:43.554 --> 02:44:45.074]  Justin, great points.
[02:44:45.215 --> 02:44:46.215]  I appreciate your call.
[02:44:46.275 --> 02:44:52.177]  I would just add, I mean, it's a good idea and it's also a good illustration of how much they lie, but don't give them ideas.
[02:44:52.897 --> 02:44:59.159]  The government will create its own truth commission and arrest us for saying global warming isn't real and put taxes on us.
[02:45:01.380 --> 02:45:04.782]  Or they'll arrest Ron Paul or put taxes on him.
[02:45:04.822 --> 02:45:05.663]  See, that's how it works.
[02:45:05.763 --> 02:45:07.184]  They judge.
[02:45:07.264 --> 02:45:08.745]  They set up the phony panels.
[02:45:09.285 --> 02:45:14.868]  Like, if you say the sky is blue, they'll put a $10,000 fine on you and say, no, you don't see a blue sky.
[02:45:15.389 --> 02:45:16.789]  The government says it's red.
[02:45:18.931 --> 02:45:21.652]  But that's a great idea, Justin.
[02:45:21.672 --> 02:45:22.513]  I appreciate your call.
[02:45:23.053 --> 02:45:25.395]  Oh, by the way, another program note here.
[02:45:26.443 --> 02:45:37.021]  If you just tuned in or you're a radio listener and not a PrisonPlanet.tv viewer, and you want to be able to see, you know, unedited in one piece, the torture of a iPad,
[02:45:39.252 --> 02:45:40.313]  Psychological test.
[02:45:40.733 --> 02:45:41.954]  Group psychology test.
[02:45:42.395 --> 02:45:45.458]  It's up on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:45:45.518 --> 02:45:46.198]  It just went up.
[02:45:46.559 --> 02:45:48.460]  It just went live at YouTube.
[02:45:49.001 --> 02:45:52.724]  And it's important to take that link from InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:45:52.764 --> 02:45:54.246]  It's posted both places now.
[02:45:54.786 --> 02:45:59.010]  And get it out to everyone you know, because they'll see somebody tortures an iPad.
[02:45:59.210 --> 02:46:01.452]  There's all this big hype and hysteria over iPad.
[02:46:01.832 --> 02:46:05.616]  And all these people that don't care about the truth of the Patriot Movement, they may get
[02:46:08.777 --> 02:46:13.118]  into looking at this information and start thinking about the real world what's really happening.
[02:46:13.519 --> 02:46:16.199]  We may get a lot of people out of the matrix with this video.
[02:46:16.339 --> 02:46:19.760]  Just one more salvo, one more idea, one more action we've taken.
[02:46:20.681 --> 02:46:22.841]  As I torture the iPad to death.
[02:46:22.921 --> 02:46:26.002]  Find out why I did it at InfoWars.com.
[02:46:26.042 --> 02:46:28.203]  If you just joined us, go to InfoWars.com.
[02:46:28.223 --> 02:46:30.344]  It'll be up today, tomorrow, throughout the weekend.
[02:46:31.224 --> 02:46:39.316]  Infowars.com, send it to the media, and then ask the media, why did you get upset over the torture of an iPad but not torture of children?
[02:46:39.697 --> 02:46:44.143]  So the torture of an iPad, I tortured one to death yesterday here in my office.
[02:46:44.203 --> 02:46:45.125]  Will I be arrested?
[02:46:45.585 --> 02:46:46.166]  Who knows?
[02:46:48.188 --> 02:46:49.349]  So the torture of an iPad.
[02:46:49.409 --> 02:46:50.110]  Infowars.com.
[02:46:50.150 --> 02:46:54.493]  If you want to read the article about it and watch the video in one piece and share it.
[02:46:55.174 --> 02:46:57.616]  We've got a bet going here in the office.
[02:46:57.636 --> 02:47:02.760]  I don't do a lot of wage earning, but we did have a pool of $20 with the guys last night.
[02:47:02.780 --> 02:47:05.062]  Anybody else wants to get involved here in the office, by the way, can.
[02:47:05.823 --> 02:47:08.405]  I'm guessing in seven days it'll have 400,000 views.
[02:47:08.465 --> 02:47:12.328]  It's whoever gets closest numerically.
[02:47:13.149 --> 02:47:14.349]  And that can be below or above.
[02:47:14.409 --> 02:47:15.510]  It's not like the price is right.
[02:47:15.530 --> 02:47:16.770]  It can just be whoever's the closest.
[02:47:17.150 --> 02:47:17.390]  I said 400,000.
[02:47:17.570 --> 02:47:18.951]  Some said a million.
[02:47:18.991 --> 02:47:20.231]  Some said 200,000.
[02:47:21.391 --> 02:47:22.152]  But we'll see.
[02:47:22.292 --> 02:47:33.995]  Seven days from now, from the time this was launched at about 2.40 or so Central Time until next Thursday at this same time, we will see who is going to win this.
[02:47:34.855 --> 02:47:36.816]  Let's go ahead and talk to Lynn in Oregon.
[02:47:36.836 --> 02:47:37.396]  You're on the air.
[02:47:37.456 --> 02:47:37.796]  Go ahead.
[02:47:37.816 --> 02:47:38.537]  Howdy, Alex.
[02:47:38.557 --> 02:47:38.597]  Hi.
[02:47:41.927 --> 02:47:43.307]  Well, I'll try to go fast.
[02:47:43.567 --> 02:48:02.014]  I'm a 7th generation Texan here stuck in Oregon and what we have a problem with here is that it's kind of hard to align with very liberal areas and we're trying to find ways to try to get out and connect with other people that are more liberal but we can align with them.
[02:48:02.955 --> 02:48:05.616]  And where we can align with them is on the drug war.
[02:48:06.756 --> 02:48:21.264]  And what we've done here in this area, we've just gotten a booth at the Global Cannabis March that Oregon Normal is throwing in downtown Portland at Pioneer Courtyard Square.
[02:48:22.025 --> 02:48:28.068]  And what we've done is we've burned over about 150 copies of How the Weed Won the West and The American Drug War.
[02:48:29.171 --> 02:48:37.758]  And we're going to be giving out those CDs at that march, and then hopefully we can connect with the more, you know, the more liberal people.
[02:48:37.778 --> 02:48:41.721]  You need to just reach out to him and say, liberal, conservative, it's a controlled paradigm.
[02:48:41.801 --> 02:48:42.382]  Wake up!
[02:48:43.122 --> 02:48:46.865]  The health care plan is nothing but a payoff to big corporations.
[02:48:46.905 --> 02:48:51.869]  And it's good that that news is getting out, because even mainline pundits are now having to admit that.
[02:48:51.949 --> 02:48:52.830]  Very exciting, Lynn.
[02:48:52.850 --> 02:48:53.490]  Good to hear from you.
[02:48:54.231 --> 02:48:55.932]  Brian in Canada, who disagrees.
[02:48:55.952 --> 02:48:56.653]  Go ahead, Brian.
[02:48:58.376 --> 02:49:00.057]  Colorado, yeah.
[02:49:00.137 --> 02:49:05.418]  The name Barry Sotoro, I disagree with using that name and I'll tell you why.
[02:49:05.438 --> 02:49:07.399]  Do you know what name he graduated by?
[02:49:07.419 --> 02:49:10.360]  Um, no.
[02:49:11.540 --> 02:49:14.781]  Barry Obama, and he went to Punahou High School.
[02:49:15.181 --> 02:49:17.822]  I also believe I know his CIA name.
[02:49:17.862 --> 02:49:19.143]  Did he not work in the CIA?
[02:49:20.475 --> 02:49:22.436]  Well, Reverend Manning says he has that evidence.
[02:49:22.456 --> 02:49:25.017]  And by the way, I've been saying for two weeks I want to get Reverend Manning back on.
[02:49:25.037 --> 02:49:25.898]  Let's get him on next week.
[02:49:26.678 --> 02:49:28.439]  Tarpley says there's a lot of evidence of that.
[02:49:28.879 --> 02:49:30.200]  But he's had a bunch of different names.
[02:49:30.240 --> 02:49:34.642]  And yes, I did know about the Barry Obama name he also used on the diploma.
[02:49:34.702 --> 02:49:36.843]  I just wasn't specific which graduation.
[02:49:36.863 --> 02:49:37.884]  I think he has three degrees.
[02:49:38.604 --> 02:49:41.545]  But we know when he was adopted, it was Bari Sotaro.
[02:49:42.266 --> 02:49:44.467]  And that makes him ineligible to be president.
[02:49:44.927 --> 02:49:55.331]  Clearly he was born in Kenya as well, but we can't 100% prove that, but we know he's an Indonesian citizen and his name is Barry Sitaro, hence we're putting that info out.
[02:49:56.211 --> 02:50:03.614]  Well, okay, now let me tell you what I think his last name is, because I ran into someone that's, you know what G2 is?
[02:50:05.174 --> 02:50:06.915]  Oh, that's a clearance level in the government?
[02:50:08.375 --> 02:50:10.056]  G2 is counterintelligence.
[02:50:10.416 --> 02:50:10.596]  Yeah.
[02:50:11.687 --> 02:50:17.252]  This guy is in G2, not knowing who he was talking to.
[02:50:17.292 --> 02:50:18.352]  He spelled the beans.
[02:50:18.773 --> 02:50:23.457]  And I'm going to expose the name on tax day, because what better day is there?
[02:50:23.477 --> 02:50:24.337]  Okay, expose it!
[02:50:25.318 --> 02:50:28.200]  B-O-E-H-M-E-R, Bomer.
[02:50:28.300 --> 02:50:29.942]  Now, I did not get the first name.
[02:50:30.464 --> 02:50:33.025]  He said, I saw a document with that name on it.
[02:50:33.085 --> 02:50:34.526]  And I said, what document?
[02:50:34.806 --> 02:50:36.627]  He says, why are you interrogating me?
[02:50:36.988 --> 02:50:38.709]  I said, I'm not interrogating you.
[02:50:38.769 --> 02:50:40.450]  I just wondered what the document was.
[02:50:41.610 --> 02:50:42.871]  I don't like to speculate.
[02:50:42.891 --> 02:50:45.672]  We'll try to flesh that out and send us an email about it, sir.
[02:50:46.253 --> 02:50:48.694]  We know his name is Barry Sitaro on record.
[02:50:49.054 --> 02:50:50.335]  We know he's an Indonesian citizen.
[02:50:50.455 --> 02:50:50.755]  Done.
[02:50:51.115 --> 02:50:51.596]  Case closed.
[02:50:52.176 --> 02:50:53.418]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:50:53.478 --> 02:50:58.825]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:50:59.066 --> 02:51:03.692]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:51:04.073 --> 02:51:04.473]  It's true.
[02:51:04.553 --> 02:51:09.120]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:51:09.640 --> 02:51:14.343]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:51:14.864 --> 02:51:16.785]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:51:17.185 --> 02:51:21.788]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:51:21.988 --> 02:51:22.889]  And here's the best part.
[02:51:23.109 --> 02:51:25.871]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:51:26.171 --> 02:51:29.453]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:51:29.794 --> 02:51:32.636]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:51:32.976 --> 02:51:34.877]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:51:35.217 --> 02:51:36.118]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:51:39.761 --> 02:51:40.782]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:51:41.203 --> 02:51:48.514]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:51:48.835 --> 02:51:51.219]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:51:56.612 --> 02:51:57.553]  Tyranny is here.
[02:51:57.873 --> 02:52:01.516]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:52:01.536 --> 02:52:04.058]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:52:04.218 --> 02:52:09.483]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[02:52:09.923 --> 02:52:16.128]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:52:16.568 --> 02:52:22.133]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:52:22.553 --> 02:52:26.257]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:52:26.737 --> 02:52:30.720]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:52:31.021 --> 02:52:36.585]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:52:36.986 --> 02:52:39.948]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:52:40.529 --> 02:52:41.950]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:52:42.490 --> 02:52:42.931]  It's here.

[02:52:52.208 --> 02:52:52.528]  Fact.
[02:52:52.548 --> 02:52:54.110]  4 million people in the U.S.
[02:52:54.150 --> 02:52:55.952]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[02:52:56.272 --> 02:52:56.592]  Fact.
[02:52:56.792 --> 02:53:00.155]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the 8th leading cause of death among Americans.
[02:53:00.476 --> 02:53:00.796]  Fact.
[02:53:01.096 --> 02:53:06.401]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[02:53:06.601 --> 02:53:06.922]  Fact.
[02:53:06.942 --> 02:53:11.106]  1 in 10 Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[02:53:11.446 --> 02:53:11.786]  Fact.
[02:53:12.026 --> 02:53:15.710]  Anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[02:53:58.053 --> 02:54:04.514]  We'll be back live tomorrow on 1in4Wars.com, iPad torture to death and psychological experiment.
[02:54:05.394 --> 02:54:05.734]  And hey!
[02:54:07.068 --> 02:54:08.109]  I did this last year.
[02:54:08.129 --> 02:54:09.149]  It's now something we do.
[02:54:09.169 --> 02:54:12.251]  I've lost my shirt to the Internal Revenue Service.
[02:54:12.312 --> 02:54:14.973]  I know it's illegal, unlawful, didn't have it until 1913.
[02:54:15.674 --> 02:54:16.835]  Goes to the private bankers.
[02:54:16.875 --> 02:54:18.376]  You can zoom down a little bit more, boys.
[02:54:19.136 --> 02:54:20.897]  And look, I'm not wearing a shirt here.
[02:54:20.917 --> 02:54:22.979]  I don't have a shirt on.
[02:54:24.119 --> 02:54:26.041]  In fact, the government can have
[02:54:27.301 --> 02:54:29.021]  My watch as well, here, here.
[02:54:29.501 --> 02:54:31.482]  For the private bankers, it's all yours, here.
[02:54:31.982 --> 02:54:32.562]  My boots!
[02:54:33.042 --> 02:54:35.562]  It's even worse than last year, and the taxes are all going up.
[02:54:35.923 --> 02:54:36.823]  It's all yours!
[02:54:37.283 --> 02:54:38.283]  You can have it all!
[02:54:38.843 --> 02:54:40.123]  Enjoy it, parasites!
[02:54:40.143 --> 02:54:40.823]  You own me!
[02:54:41.644 --> 02:54:42.484]  I'm your slave!
[02:54:42.764 --> 02:54:44.524]  And now under health care, they own my body!
[02:54:44.564 --> 02:54:51.745]  They get to decide what type of health care I get, and they're trying to push forced inoculation, with the whole swine flu hysteria, that they can force things in my body!
[02:54:51.765 --> 02:54:54.866]  So I guess, you don't just own, uh,
[02:54:55.606 --> 02:55:00.327]  My clothes and my watch and my wallet and my bank account, but you own my body.
[02:55:00.367 --> 02:55:03.748]  You own my labor that my body creates, that my mind creates.
[02:55:03.808 --> 02:55:04.428]  I'm a serf.
[02:55:04.488 --> 02:55:05.128]  I'm a slave.
[02:55:05.388 --> 02:55:06.029]  I don't want to be.
[02:55:06.069 --> 02:55:07.269]  I'm reclaiming my liberty.
[02:55:09.229 --> 02:55:11.730]  I'm reclaiming my freedom.
[02:55:12.650 --> 02:55:14.411]  And all of us need to do that.
[02:55:15.611 --> 02:55:21.672]  We will be premiering the new film, Invisible Empire, at PrisonPlanet.tv in about T-minus five minutes.
[02:55:21.712 --> 02:55:24.193]  It's going up there right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:26.109 --> 02:55:29.433]  I guess let's go ahead and end this with a couple more phone calls.
[02:55:30.694 --> 02:55:32.876]  Let's talk to Mark in New Mexico.
[02:55:32.956 --> 02:55:33.757]  Mark, you're on the air.
[02:55:37.020 --> 02:55:38.382]  Okay, Max in California.
[02:55:41.505 --> 02:55:42.086]  Go ahead, Max.
[02:55:43.163 --> 02:55:52.254]  Hi Alex, I've been watching your videos and I didn't hear anything about an Australian government merging with another government.
[02:55:53.335 --> 02:55:54.737]  How is that possible?
[02:55:54.777 --> 02:56:01.245]  They have a pretty large size land and nothing happened with that country.
[02:56:01.686 --> 02:56:02.226]  Say it again?
[02:56:03.664 --> 02:56:08.507]  I'm talking about Australian government.
[02:56:08.567 --> 02:56:18.673]  How come Australian government does not get involved in any, you know, emerging, you know, like... Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:56:18.753 --> 02:56:20.214]  They're part of the Asian Union.
[02:56:20.934 --> 02:56:24.597]  They're taking most of the farmers' and ranchers' property just outright for carbon taxes.
[02:56:24.617 --> 02:56:26.178]  They've confiscated most of the guns.
[02:56:26.598 --> 02:56:28.139]  They're passing hate speech laws.
[02:56:28.179 --> 02:56:31.581]  They're passing one of the most draconian internet censorship laws.
[02:56:32.122 --> 02:56:34.303]  Australia is part of the British Commonwealth.
[02:56:36.185 --> 02:56:43.810]  In 1979, their parliament said no to the New World Order, so the Queen had her Governor-General come in and veto them.
[02:56:43.870 --> 02:56:46.271]  That's happened twice in the last three years in Canada.
[02:56:46.792 --> 02:56:49.714]  Australia is descending into a New World Order pit.
[02:56:50.538 --> 02:56:52.319]  Okay, so I have to disagree with you.
[02:56:52.400 --> 02:56:55.362]  No, Australia is deeply involved with the New World Order.
[02:56:55.542 --> 02:57:01.927]  Every country in the world is either under New World Order control or they're being bombarded and invaded or sanctioned or attacked.
[02:57:02.367 --> 02:57:04.769]  Doesn't mean that countries that aren't part of the New World Order are good either.
[02:57:04.969 --> 02:57:05.970]  Most governments are bad.
[02:57:06.510 --> 02:57:11.234]  It's just they're not part of the big mega-eugenics New World Order, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:57:12.635 --> 02:57:14.457]  And for all of you out there that don't realize
[02:57:15.566 --> 02:57:20.427]  That even if you don't pay high income taxes, you don't get paid as much because your bosses are.
