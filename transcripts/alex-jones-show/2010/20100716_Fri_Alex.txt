[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.570]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:09.351 --> 00:00:09.991]  Big Brother.
[00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:11.692]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:13.632]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:14.172 --> 00:00:14.992]  You want answers?
[00:00:15.753 --> 00:00:16.693]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:17.313 --> 00:00:21.214]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:21.474 --> 00:00:25.555]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.520]  It is Friday, July 16, 2010.
[00:00:32.762 --> 00:00:40.966]  Bob Chapman joins us for about 40 minutes coming up in the next hour to break down what's happening with the economy, as he does every Friday.
[00:00:42.087 --> 00:00:47.370]  And I have all the vital stacks of news and information here in front of me that we're going to be covering.
[00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.253]  BP claims for the first time in 80-plus days that they have stopped the leak.
[00:00:54.173 --> 00:01:00.823]  And I pray that they're not lying because they've said this at least three times that I can remember in the last 87 plus days.
[00:01:04.278 --> 00:01:06.519]  So we'll be breaking that down.
[00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:24.549]  I was here in the office last night when Aaron Dykes and I were doing research for the full-spectrum dominance eugenics film that we are working on that deals with chemtrails and other issues, and we have come across so much more information than our awareness
[00:01:26.172 --> 00:01:30.777]  of the Globalist Master Plan is growing exponentially.
[00:01:31.217 --> 00:01:33.079]  Don't think that you ever know everything.
[00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.406]  The more we learn, the more horrified we get to discover that things are far worse than we originally thought.
[00:01:40.106 --> 00:01:44.611]  So I sent the Rockefeller Foundation document over to Paul Watson.
[00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:46.193]  He wrote a story about it this morning.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.802]  And just everything we talk about here, the magnitude is off the chart.
[00:01:51.862 --> 00:01:54.985]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful.
[00:01:55.605 --> 00:01:59.087]  And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here, minute by minute.
[00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.051]  Because I've had chills since last night.
[00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:07.453]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[00:02:10.075 --> 00:02:14.518]  But Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite.
[00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:22.322]  Millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family, everything that's in the other documents.
[00:02:22.382 --> 00:02:29.945]  But this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and the forced vaccines.
[00:02:31.223 --> 00:02:37.707]  The hell we're already living in that's just going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[00:02:38.447 --> 00:02:41.028]  But that story is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:42.749]  We sent this to Watson.
[00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:44.090]  I'm glad he did a report on it today.
[00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.952]  Rockefeller Study Envisions Future Dictatorship Controlled by the Elite.
[00:02:47.992 --> 00:02:50.574]  And I want to go through a bunch of other news.
[00:02:51.074 --> 00:02:55.677]  Here's Mark Moreno, one of the top advisors to the Republican caucus.
[00:02:57.378 --> 00:02:59.879]  So a lot of powerful people now paying attention finally.
[00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:04.740]  Population control advocate wanted to sterilize population through food and water.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.321]  That's Climate Depot.
[00:03:06.361 --> 00:03:14.283]  So, of course, we've been covering this for well over 14, 15 years, but now it's finally starting to become mainstream news.
[00:03:15.143 --> 00:03:18.404]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[00:03:18.484 --> 00:03:21.665]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[00:03:24.738 --> 00:03:36.524]  When I tell you that they're saturating almost all the major food crops with sodium fluoride and it concentrates in the food to levels thousands of times in many cases above what's in the water.
[00:03:36.784 --> 00:03:38.385]  I mean one part per million is devastating.
[00:03:39.406 --> 00:03:43.288]  900 parts per million in powdered eggs is just off the charts.
[00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:45.985]  Uh, total brain damage.
[00:03:46.005 --> 00:03:49.590]  Uh, and, uh, the hundreds of parts per million in many of the food crops now.
[00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:57.801]  And that's not just to mention the fact that these crops can also absorb pesticides, uh, and are designed to live in pesticides, and that concentrates in them.
[00:03:58.102 --> 00:03:58.903]  Or that the, uh...
[00:03:59.924 --> 00:04:03.007]  DNA has been altered to also cause sterilization.
[00:04:03.047 --> 00:04:04.629]  I mean, they're hitting us on so many fronts.
[00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:12.718]  And I've got all the government reports admitting that the births, year by year, they're studying that human DNA is being damaged at a level never before seen.
[00:04:12.778 --> 00:04:13.819]  We are being mutated.
[00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:17.603]  And many of us that are able to even think and operate today
[00:04:19.574 --> 00:04:26.238]  Our children, their children, and the children after them are going to be deformed monsters who are literally drooling basket cases.
[00:04:26.758 --> 00:04:29.119]  But of course that will never even get to that point.
[00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:31.200]  They plan to exterminate all of us long before then.
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.721]  It's just an absolute fact.
[00:04:33.801 --> 00:04:37.363]  And why do we have to sit here and fight with each other?
[00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:40.885]  Government, bureaucrats, police, military, everybody.
[00:04:41.906 --> 00:04:43.286]  I mean, we're all in this together.
[00:04:43.326 --> 00:04:44.867]  It's a tiny elite, less than 6,000 globalists,
[00:04:47.714 --> 00:05:03.764]  in their own analysis that rule the planet and look I'm gonna get it all the news coming up in your phone calls today it's just this is so horrible they're they're collapsing the economy so they can take control of us through the government health care system and soft kill us
[00:05:04.997 --> 00:05:07.600]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.965]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:13.325 --> 00:05:15.067]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:15.387 --> 00:05:20.192]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:20.392 --> 00:05:21.353]  How much do you want?
[00:05:21.574 --> 00:05:22.314]  When do you want it?
[00:05:22.695 --> 00:05:24.296]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:24.576 --> 00:05:25.397]  When will you need it?
[00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:27.720]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.841]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:29.181 --> 00:05:33.083]  Will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself?
[00:05:33.243 --> 00:05:35.764]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:35.964 --> 00:05:39.146]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:39.546 --> 00:05:43.047]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:43.368 --> 00:05:44.348]  How much will you need?
[00:05:44.588 --> 00:05:45.208]  We don't know.
[00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:46.409]  How much do you want?
[00:05:46.609 --> 00:05:47.329]  All you can get.
[00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:48.330]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.374]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:51.675 --> 00:05:53.878]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:53.918 --> 00:05:54.880]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.992]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[00:06:11.693 --> 00:06:16.135]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.
[00:06:16.955 --> 00:06:30.321]  Featuring Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Joseph Farah, David Icke, Naomi Wolf, G. Edward Griffin, Doug McIntyre, Mark Crispin Miller, Mickey Z, Doug Casey, David McElhaney, and myself, Alex Jones.
[00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:35.724]  Protect yourself and get the tools you need to protect your family from these difficult times.
[00:06:36.304 --> 00:06:45.929]  The Fall of America and the Western World at www.thefallofamerica.net or click on the banners at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:51.652]  Again, that website's www.thefallofamerica.net or call 800-655-1577.
[00:06:51.672 --> 00:06:54.554]  Prepare yourself and the ones you love today.
[00:06:54.574 --> 00:06:55.915]  fallofamerica.net
[00:07:03.609 --> 00:07:07.852]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:08.172 --> 00:07:08.773]  Number 1.
[00:07:09.073 --> 00:07:12.235]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:12.516 --> 00:07:13.056]  Number 2.
[00:07:13.376 --> 00:07:17.920]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.700]  It's true.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.564]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:23.884 --> 00:07:24.404]  Number 3.
[00:07:24.705 --> 00:07:27.987]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:28.287 --> 00:07:31.990]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:32.731]  Number 4.
[00:07:32.991 --> 00:07:35.354]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:35.754 --> 00:07:39.138]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:39.438 --> 00:07:39.638]  Number 5.
[00:07:40.219 --> 00:07:44.143]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:44.364 --> 00:07:49.129]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:49.409 --> 00:07:53.431]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:53.571 --> 00:07:55.131]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:55.372 --> 00:07:57.452]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:07:57.633 --> 00:08:00.214]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:08:00.234 --> 00:08:14.420]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.441]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.601]  It is Friday.
[00:08:21.681 --> 00:08:24.463]  We cover the real issues here on this broadcast.
[00:08:24.483 --> 00:08:30.248]  I'll be back, of course, this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., with the abbreviated Sunday Transmission.
[00:08:35.752 --> 00:08:37.794]  Again, I want to thank you for joining us.
[00:08:39.115 --> 00:08:41.557]  I want you to know that I do have a great weight on me.
[00:08:43.018 --> 00:08:47.982]  With knowledge comes great sorrow, the Bible says, but with knowledge also
[00:08:49.361 --> 00:08:55.043]  comes the power to be able to protect yourself and your family and to have a healthier society.
[00:08:55.063 --> 00:09:11.587]  When we don't struggle for a more just and pure society, and when we stop recognizing good from evil, we always see the decline of civilization and the most wicked, the most abusive, the most sadistic, the most psychopathic take control.
[00:09:11.607 --> 00:09:16.028]  I want to get into eugenics today.
[00:09:17.659 --> 00:09:28.126]  Coming up later in the hour and throughout the broadcast, because there's been a lot of information coming out even in the mainstream media, just further documenting everything that we discuss here.
[00:09:28.187 --> 00:09:39.194]  And I want you today to really meditate, to focus, to cogitate, to think about the issues we're laying out here.
[00:09:39.254 --> 00:09:41.836]  We are living in the middle of an orchestrated collapse.
[00:09:42.757 --> 00:09:45.439]  The United States has been in a major depression.
[00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:50.491]  Many more economists every day come out and admit that that is the case.
[00:09:51.872 --> 00:10:00.036]  Even Yahoo Finance today is admitting that all the numbers show that the middle class is being eradicated and that globalization is the cause.
[00:10:00.296 --> 00:10:02.397]  And they call it a nasty side effect.
[00:10:03.458 --> 00:10:04.979]  No, it is not a side effect.
[00:10:06.516 --> 00:10:20.671]  If an executioner walks you up onto a platform and puts your neck in a noose and pulls the lever and the floor falls out from beneath you and you fall six feet and the acceleration snaps your neck, death is not a side effect.
[00:10:21.432 --> 00:10:23.855]  Death was the goal.
[00:10:27.049 --> 00:10:46.698]  And the reason the orchestrated financial collapse is so important is it ties into the government healthcare, which in the globalist-owned documents and statements is meant to set up a genetic dictatorship, a dictatorship over life and death, government-sponsored and pushed euthanasia, one-child policies.
[00:10:48.818 --> 00:10:54.421]  Being dependent on these psychopaths, these people who like to play God,
[00:10:57.543 --> 00:11:00.924]  Being dependent on them is death.
[00:11:02.525 --> 00:11:06.727]  And it is slow, creeping, incremental, orchestrated death.
[00:11:13.589 --> 00:11:24.153]  If you put poison, there are many poisons that are undetectable to the taste buds or to the nostrils, to the olfactory nerve.
[00:11:24.673 --> 00:11:25.574]  If you put poison
[00:11:26.747 --> 00:11:49.145]  Say, in a African savannah waterhole, the elephants, the lions, the zebras, the giraffes, the baboons, the wild African dogs, they will all come to the waterhole, the hippopotamus, they will drink from it and they will die.
[00:11:50.406 --> 00:11:53.608]  And even as they see their fellow lions and elephants
[00:11:54.753 --> 00:12:10.365]  And baboons dying, they will continue to drink because they are not conscious creatures who are able to scientifically analyze what's happening to them.
[00:12:10.866 --> 00:12:18.612]  And the globalists see you as animals, they believe that you are incapable of looking around you and seeing the design.
[00:12:24.005 --> 00:12:34.516]  When it is in hundreds and hundreds of government-funded policy reports, policy directives, policy plans.
[00:12:39.821 --> 00:12:47.669]  There are so many of these reports that Aaron Dykes, only aided by coffee,
[00:12:50.825 --> 00:12:55.952]  Many days will not sleep and I have to make him go home after two days of being up here.
[00:12:56.353 --> 00:13:07.769]  This is somebody I hired right out of the University of Texas five years ago who didn't really believe in what I was doing, who didn't really buy what I was saying and kind of laughed when I hired him.
[00:13:11.172 --> 00:13:12.673]  That's exactly who I wanted to hire.
[00:13:13.273 --> 00:13:14.233]  I wanted him to see it.
[00:13:14.754 --> 00:13:18.876]  And he'd gone to, you know, the UT Public Relations School.
[00:13:18.936 --> 00:13:21.457]  You know, he had very good grades when he graduated.
[00:13:21.477 --> 00:13:22.477]  He was very intelligent.
[00:13:23.078 --> 00:13:26.039]  And I said, you are going to see the dark side.
[00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:35.564]  Now, he is so obsessed with reading hundreds of reports on how they're poisoning the water, the food, how they are spraying us via aircraft.
[00:13:37.199 --> 00:13:51.804]  The Rockefeller studies, the books on eugenics written by the Globalist, that he is probably the only other person in this office who has reached the level of my understanding and perhaps dealing with eugenics even surpassed it.
[00:13:53.765 --> 00:13:55.425]  And every day he says, look at this.
[00:13:55.985 --> 00:13:58.166]  This is another Rockefeller Foundation report.
[00:13:58.886 --> 00:14:00.147]  And I said, send it to Watson.
[00:14:00.227 --> 00:14:01.107]  You're going home.
[00:14:01.207 --> 00:14:01.967]  It's midnight.
[00:14:02.988 --> 00:14:03.748]  You're going home.
[00:14:03.788 --> 00:14:05.048]  You're not writing an article on this.
[00:14:05.108 --> 00:14:05.889]  Send it to Watson.
[00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:06.509]  He'll do it.
[00:14:09.864 --> 00:14:10.424]  And you know what?
[00:14:10.484 --> 00:14:12.705]  That's a normal response by Aaron.
[00:14:12.745 --> 00:14:13.466]  He's normal.
[00:14:13.746 --> 00:14:15.066]  He's got his head screwed on straight.
[00:14:15.967 --> 00:14:21.709]  You can't read government documents where they brag, going back 60 years, how they're poisoning the water in the food.
[00:14:22.109 --> 00:14:27.571]  Over 60 years ago, how they would genetically engineer crops when they discovered the double helix and discovered DNA.
[00:14:27.912 --> 00:14:38.136]  And how they would create binary weapons and other degenerative weapons that take time and that mix with other poisons and bio-agents that have been introduced.
[00:14:39.716 --> 00:14:49.625]  So that the average compartmentalized doctor or even specialist can't recognize it, though there are now thousands of doctors and chemists and scientists that have reverse-engineered what's going on and have gone public.
[00:14:49.965 --> 00:14:51.287]  But you don't have to reverse-engineer it.
[00:14:51.747 --> 00:15:01.255]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers, so many of them, that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast.
[00:15:04.238 --> 00:15:04.959]  So fast.
[00:15:07.992 --> 00:15:09.655]  That you could never read them all.
[00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:17.205]  A group of just two or three people here in my office that researched this, we could never read them all.
[00:15:17.306 --> 00:15:19.008]  It is warehouses full of it.
[00:15:19.969 --> 00:15:22.954]  It is an open conspiracy against you and your family.
[00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:45.035]  I pray to God, I pray to my Heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength and the will to be able to face this horror and to give me the strength to carry on because I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information and just want to comment on the YouTube videos or on message boards and I'm a liar.
[00:15:46.895 --> 00:15:47.455]  I know why.
[00:15:47.895 --> 00:15:49.056]  Because it's scary.
[00:15:49.876 --> 00:15:54.057]  And if you admit this to yourself, you're not going to be able to go to the ballgames anymore.
[00:15:55.267 --> 00:15:57.589]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[00:15:57.609 --> 00:16:04.976]  You're not going to be able to just, you know, go out and enjoy yourself all the time and not spend some of your energy on resisting this.
[00:16:05.117 --> 00:16:10.742]  And once you face this information, once you've consciously admitted it to yourself, it will take over your life.
[00:16:11.122 --> 00:16:12.504]  It should take over your life.
[00:16:14.446 --> 00:16:15.226]  I mean, what else?
[00:16:15.867 --> 00:16:16.728]  What else could it do?
[00:16:21.121 --> 00:16:35.894]  The only chance we've got of beating this scientific dictatorship, this creeping death that takes its time to incrementally enslave you, mentally, psychologically, physically, spiritually, the only way
[00:16:39.158 --> 00:16:46.985]  To defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet to realize that you have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be.
[00:16:47.525 --> 00:16:51.148]  Win, lose, or draw, you need to choose a side.
[00:16:51.288 --> 00:17:06.981]  You need to spend some time this afternoon, this evening, over the weekend to close the shutters, to sit there in your easy chair, and to just sit back
[00:17:08.041 --> 00:17:15.645]  And think about the claims I've made here and decide on whether or not you're going to research the information we've laid out.
[00:17:16.165 --> 00:17:17.706]  Because this information is too important.
[00:17:17.846 --> 00:17:26.671]  I do not want you to simply sit here and listen to what I've said and then go out on message boards and say Alex Jones says they want to reduce our population.
[00:17:27.491 --> 00:17:28.752]  That they are poisoning us.
[00:17:29.332 --> 00:17:36.216]  And that they're incrementally increasing the amount of poisons and genetic manipulation that's going on.
[00:17:55.543 --> 00:18:05.909]  We've got to get past the artificial stigma that the controlled corporate media has been putting out for decades ahead of their open unveiling of planetary dictatorship.
[00:18:05.929 --> 00:18:17.896]  I mean, all these reports, whether it's the Rockefeller report we were reading last night that we're linked to on PrisonPlanet.com, or whether it's Ecoscience, or whether it's
[00:18:19.093 --> 00:18:22.111]  Time Magazine saying only have one child, it's good for the environment.
[00:18:29.212 --> 00:18:32.535]  They all talk about how we need a police state to carry this out.
[00:18:32.835 --> 00:18:44.544]  They're now in hundreds of publications the last six months, in the British and US and European newspapers and Australian as well, saying, you know what, the public's too stupid to agree to one-child policies and euthanasia and all this.
[00:18:45.065 --> 00:18:51.370]  We need a planetary police state, that's their quote over and over again, to carry out this great work.
[00:18:52.891 --> 00:18:53.972]  They're being public about it.
[00:18:55.563 --> 00:19:05.187]  In fact, I'm going to come back from break here in a minute, and I'm going to go ahead and get into this first, the whole eugenics, and just what's on my plate today.
[00:19:06.768 --> 00:19:08.548]  Just what's in the mainstream news today.
[00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:14.731]  And when I make the point that, without even looking, we're not even looking for this stuff, it's just everywhere.
[00:19:15.471 --> 00:19:23.194]  This is their religion, this is their system, this is their methodology, their way of life, what they believe in.
[00:19:26.147 --> 00:19:38.539]  Even your average yuppie who's under this scientific attack knows that to receive knowledge and wisdom, that their false common sense says, yeah there's too many people, and you tell a yuppie about other foods being poison, well there are too many people!
[00:19:39.099 --> 00:19:39.640]  You fool!
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.421]  They're hitting you too!
[00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:50.490]  They like automatically think because they buy into it at a lower level, kind of an outer cult member, that it makes it okay.
[00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:51.631]  It's not okay.
[00:19:54.864 --> 00:19:56.865]  And the globalists are not doing this for the environment.
[00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:58.447]  They are destroying the environment.
[00:19:58.807 --> 00:20:01.809]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet right now.
[00:20:01.829 --> 00:20:03.050]  You need to understand that.
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.261]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:20:08.641 --> 00:20:10.462]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:20:10.922 --> 00:20:11.342]  Don't!
[00:20:11.802 --> 00:20:14.823]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:20:15.224 --> 00:20:22.366]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[00:20:22.346 --> 00:20:24.007]  's number one debt secret.
[00:20:24.327 --> 00:20:27.988]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[00:20:28.388 --> 00:20:31.111]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[00:20:31.532 --> 00:20:38.580]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:39.921]  Herb K was right.
[00:20:40.101 --> 00:20:43.125]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:20:43.285 --> 00:20:44.165]  What do you have to lose?
[00:20:44.545 --> 00:20:45.505]  Stop the calls now.
[00:20:45.765 --> 00:20:47.486]  Get out of debt and have more money.
[00:20:47.726 --> 00:20:51.026]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now.

[00:20:52.027 --> 00:20:52.067]  800-405-7850.
[00:20:52.087 --> 00:20:56.447]  The economy is crumbling, debt soaring, and the possibility of World War III is increasing.
[00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:23.709]  I started SurvivalistSeeds.com from my dining room table with a small bucket of seed and a single rotating banner ad on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:21:24.609 --> 00:21:32.154]  Two years later we've sold over 40,000 pounds of heirloom seeds becoming the largest bulk seed seller to the public.
[00:21:32.875 --> 00:21:36.577]  The majority of our customers are Alex Jones listeners.
[00:21:37.418 --> 00:21:38.239]  Now I'm offering 50
[00:21:39.464 --> 00:21:52.712]  All organic garden varieties, 10,000 heirloom seeds, garden planner, and a CD teaching you how to save seeds so your children's children will always have healthy food.
[00:21:53.593 --> 00:21:55.394]  Don't wait until it's too late.
[00:21:56.294 --> 00:22:01.678]  I'm Vic John Lipscomb and my company is survivalistseeds.com.
[00:22:05.356 --> 00:22:06.197]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:22:06.397 --> 00:22:11.723]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:22:11.923 --> 00:22:12.344]  I get it.
[00:22:12.464 --> 00:22:21.814]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:22:22.094 --> 00:22:23.256]  That's not what's happening.
[00:22:23.496 --> 00:22:31.742]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:22:31.962 --> 00:22:35.244]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:22:35.364 --> 00:22:39.447]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:22:39.627 --> 00:22:41.208]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:22:41.228 --> 00:22:44.470]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:22:45.191 --> 00:22:48.793]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:22:48.993 --> 00:22:49.714]  You should, too.
[00:22:49.894 --> 00:22:50.855]  Find out what they know.

[00:24:11.294 --> 00:24:26.277]  What I'm going to do is, I'm going to get into eugenics at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:24:28.758 --> 00:24:33.139]  I've got so many articles from just today, I'm going to go over them some more before I even cover them.
[00:24:34.599 --> 00:24:36.459]  And really lay out the facts for people.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.980]  But the bottom line is this.
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.001]  You have a decision to make.
[00:24:42.141 --> 00:24:55.425]  Are you going to let all the distractions and the diversions and the things that don't matter that are purposefully set out in front of you to distract you and to disempower you and to blind you from what's really happening?
[00:24:55.485 --> 00:24:59.447]  Are you going to let this scientific dictatorship succeed?
[00:25:01.553 --> 00:25:08.255]  Are you going to feed your children adulterated poisoned food and water by design?
[00:25:08.475 --> 00:25:11.996]  Are you going to give them poisoned drugs by design?
[00:25:12.917 --> 00:25:22.279]  Are you going to give them vaccines made in China that are designed to destroy their immune systems and give them cancer and reduce their fertility by design?
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:29.402]  Are you going to do the research and find out that aspartame is causing lower birth weights anywhere
[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:39.189]  The artificial sweetener is consumed and causing miscarriages in the studies in the 70s and in new studies out by major governments.
[00:25:42.312 --> 00:25:51.623]  I mean, how do these women out there, when everybody's heard aspartame is bad for you, at least you've heard that, how do these women and these husbands not go research it?
[00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:54.071]  Well, I'll tell you why.
[00:25:54.111 --> 00:25:54.691]  It's addictive.
[00:25:54.731 --> 00:26:03.438]  You tell somebody who drinks aspartame soft drinks or chews aspartame gum, almost every brand of even sugar gum has it added, they're highly addicted.
[00:26:03.498 --> 00:26:05.319]  That's why they'll say, no, not my drink.
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:08.422]  No, not my chips with MSG.
[00:26:08.922 --> 00:26:13.406]  Not only are the poisons they put in the food deadly, but they're also addictive.
[00:26:14.186 --> 00:26:19.831]  Many poisons in the metabolic system of humans and animals become addictive.
[00:26:22.697 --> 00:26:34.069]  Of course, in the 18th and 19th and even into the 20th century, one of the most popular forms of speed was just old-fashioned poisons.
[00:26:38.584 --> 00:26:40.985]  And it becomes very, very addictive.
[00:26:41.145 --> 00:26:41.545]  Arsenic.
[00:26:42.085 --> 00:26:43.186]  In fact, people won't believe that.
[00:26:43.246 --> 00:26:47.147]  Search engine, arsenic as a drug, or arsenic addiction.
[00:26:48.007 --> 00:26:53.049]  And just throw up the first mainstream article or government document for them watching at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:26:53.109 --> 00:26:55.470]  If you're a radio listener, you can just search engine that term.
[00:26:56.770 --> 00:27:04.114]  These excitotoxins, and we've had brain surgeons, and neurologists, and toxicologists, and biologists on to explain, and they knew this.
[00:27:04.134 --> 00:27:07.755]  They tested all of these food additives in the last 80 plus years.
[00:27:07.795 --> 00:27:19.441]  This was going on since the 20s, so really 90 years from the studies we've seen, and they found out that rats, which their metabolic system is the most closely akin to humans, pigs are almost
[00:27:21.861 --> 00:27:29.505]  As similar in the reactions that rats and pigs have to drugs and to chemicals and to poisons.
[00:27:31.365 --> 00:27:35.187]  That's why they use pig hearts in heart transplants.
[00:27:35.927 --> 00:27:36.948]  It's better than baboon.
[00:27:37.508 --> 00:27:50.054]  That's why they use pig ventricles because they found that in many cases they don't reject them as often as they would even reject a human heart.
[00:27:50.905 --> 00:27:51.845]  In a heart transplant.
[00:27:51.905 --> 00:27:54.606]  But the issue is they've tested all of this.
[00:27:54.646 --> 00:28:17.730]  And the scientists in these studies, in some cases you read in their papers, we've done some interviews with these people in the upcoming film, and they're told, look, don't worry about it if this study shows that this GMO rat feed is sterilizing more than half the first generation, over 80% the second, almost all of them are sterile by the third and the fourth deformities.
[00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:19.350]  Don't worry, there's too many people.
[00:28:20.831 --> 00:28:21.752]  Just keep your mouth shut.
[00:28:27.315 --> 00:28:40.603]  And of course we've had scientists on and named names on that particular story before, but the issue here, we did with Jeffrey Smith about a month ago, the issue here is that they have tested all of this out.
[00:28:41.103 --> 00:28:44.786]  New arsenic nanoparticle blocks aggressive breast cancer.
[00:28:44.846 --> 00:28:45.346]  Now that's a
[00:28:47.728 --> 00:28:50.849]  That's an article about them saying arsenic's good in some ways.
[00:28:50.869 --> 00:28:55.851]  Of course, poisons do, in small amounts, knock out cancers if they're delivered right.
[00:28:55.871 --> 00:28:58.452]  They also kill the other tissues and attack DNA and cells.
[00:29:00.533 --> 00:29:11.356]  The point is, is that if you research history, search engine this term, this should pull it up.
[00:29:12.597 --> 00:29:15.278]  Arsenic addiction in Elizabethan England.
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.021]  That should bring it up for you.
[00:29:21.305 --> 00:29:24.389]  Or arsenic addiction in 18th and 19th century England.
[00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:25.971]  It was epidemic.
[00:29:26.972 --> 00:29:28.955]  They didn't have a cup of tea, they had a pinch of arsenic.
[00:29:31.226 --> 00:29:33.967]  Okay, we're going to come back, get into other issues, and take your phone calls.
[00:29:33.987 --> 00:29:34.367]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:34.387 --> 00:29:42.150]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us on this Friday.
[00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:48.272]  We're going to cover the economy, the oil cap, which we pray is the truth.
[00:29:48.292 --> 00:29:49.473]  They claim they fixed it.
[00:29:49.993 --> 00:29:52.174]  What's happening on the financial end, it's all coming up.
[00:29:54.875 --> 00:29:55.795]  We're on the march.
[00:29:56.275 --> 00:29:57.776]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:58.786 --> 00:30:01.568]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:33:01.008 --> 00:33:02.729]  This information is too important to wait.
[00:33:18.629 --> 00:33:34.905]  Front porch sittin' in an old rockin' chair The sun is hot in the Texas sky Garden growin', clothes out on a line
[00:33:37.017 --> 00:33:41.178]  Let's get into the economic news.
[00:33:41.218 --> 00:33:45.039]  We'll cover it more when Bob joins us coming up at 1 o'clock hour.
[00:33:45.239 --> 00:33:47.019]  We'll go to your phone calls.
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:49.900]  A slap on the wrist for Goldman Sachs.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:34:00.463]  Goldman Sachs, of course the federal government, literally run by former Goldman Sachs alumni who hold masses of Goldman Sachs stock.
[00:34:01.543 --> 00:34:02.844]  As much of Congress does.
[00:34:03.765 --> 00:34:05.806]  They basically did nothing to them.
[00:34:06.527 --> 00:34:10.029]  And from the beginning they focused in on their investigation on Timberwolf.
[00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:16.574]  Just one little area of the scores of crimes committed by Goldman Sachs.
[00:34:17.374 --> 00:34:22.097]  And of course those emails admitted that they were selling people
[00:34:23.214 --> 00:34:23.634]  I think?
[00:34:44.264 --> 00:34:53.831]  Wrapped about the face of humanity, agreed to pay 550 million, they've made hundreds and hundreds of billions, to settle fraud charges.
[00:34:56.793 --> 00:35:02.358]  But, crucially, did not admit guilt for misleading clients over subprime mortgage products.
[00:35:02.418 --> 00:35:05.240]  So, nothing done to them.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:13.306]  Even the SEC appears to have decided no fraud was committed, and accepts that Goldman made a mistake in its marketing material, even though they said this is pure bleeping
[00:35:16.015 --> 00:35:18.597]  Remember the cuss word that the senator was using in the hearings?
[00:35:19.077 --> 00:35:21.258]  Pure bleeping that they sold the public.
[00:35:21.939 --> 00:35:27.602]  It failed to hold Goldman's feet to the fire even if no one can question the size of the fine.
[00:35:28.103 --> 00:35:39.090]  And in the new financial re-regulation package that literally gives the Federal Reserve total control over the economy with no congressional oversight, that's in the bill that the House and Senate have passed that Obama will now sign.
[00:35:40.231 --> 00:35:40.691]  They've done it.
[00:35:44.568 --> 00:35:48.591]  They don't even look at derivatives and restricting them until 2022 or 12 years from now.
[00:35:53.985 --> 00:36:11.149]  And when you read the Wall Street Journal and other reports, they'll admit, well, it is a private Federal Reserve Board made up of banking heads of the elite banks and different banking associations at the state level, like the Texas Banking Association says it's a total takeover and will be used to shut down local healthy banks that weren't involved in derivatives.
[00:36:11.489 --> 00:36:13.289]  The public is being sold this as reform.
[00:36:13.729 --> 00:36:17.410]  And I've seen emails and comments saying, Alex, why are you against reform?
[00:36:18.857 --> 00:36:21.599]  Reform would be abolishing the Federal Reserve, or at least auditing it.
[00:36:22.339 --> 00:36:28.623]  Reform would be banning derivatives that are counterfeit, fraudulent instruments that have bankrupted our society by design.
[00:36:29.163 --> 00:36:32.826]  Reform would not be bailing out these criminal institutions.
[00:36:34.338 --> 00:36:36.199]  And it's not just my analysis of the bill.
[00:36:36.259 --> 00:36:37.900]  Judge Andrew Napolitano has agreed.
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.121]  Ron Paul has agreed.
[00:36:39.401 --> 00:36:44.444]  But Ron Paul was on two weeks ago and he said you are exactly right in your analysis when I said what I just said.
[00:36:44.464 --> 00:36:46.945]  That it's a coup d'etat by the bankers.
[00:36:47.185 --> 00:36:49.427]  They took over the issuance of currency and credit in 1913, 97 years ago.
[00:36:52.168 --> 00:36:55.250]  And now they're setting up a total dictatorship over the entire economy.
[00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:58.752]  Anything that affects the economy, they have the power outside the Congress.
[00:36:58.772 --> 00:37:08.538]  This is much worse than in 1995, when the Congress handed over almost all of its trade authority, via fast track, to the World Trade Organization, itself a private board.
[00:37:09.619 --> 00:37:17.003]  And when you read the Security and Prosperity Partnership documents, and the North Atlantic Alliance Agreement, signed by Bush, Merkel and Barroso in 2007,
[00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:26.594]  It all states that private corporate boards file reports and the government implements it through the bureaucracy.
[00:37:30.817 --> 00:37:36.721]  But when you read the headline in the Wall Street Journal, lawmakers are very pleased.
[00:37:36.962 --> 00:37:38.763]  Law remakes U.S.
[00:37:38.803 --> 00:37:39.724]  financial landscape.
[00:37:39.764 --> 00:37:43.546]  Senate passes overhaul that will touch most Americans.
[00:37:44.227 --> 00:37:47.289]  Bankers gird for a fight over fine print.
[00:37:50.882 --> 00:37:55.324]  Well, it's written so the big mega six banks have run the regulatory arm.
[00:37:55.804 --> 00:37:58.045]  The private federal reserve has been given dictatorial power.
[00:37:58.065 --> 00:38:00.886]  It's totally illegitimate and we have to fight it and expose it.
[00:38:01.466 --> 00:38:06.308]  And the good news is that ABC News is reporting Senator Shelby on financial reform.
[00:38:06.588 --> 00:38:08.229]  He's saying repeal the whole thing.
[00:38:09.462 --> 00:38:15.144]  But I've seen the Republican leadership, they've not been attacking it from the popular perspective.
[00:38:15.164 --> 00:38:18.626]  They're saying it's wrong to have government regulation over Wall Street.
[00:38:18.986 --> 00:38:24.548]  This is selective government regulation by Wall Street over the government and the population.
[00:38:24.928 --> 00:38:27.289]  Remember that Washington Post article two weeks ago?
[00:38:27.309 --> 00:38:32.091]  I kept reading the quotes from it because it was so honest in the information, but not in their conclusion.
[00:38:32.111 --> 00:38:33.832]  Their conclusion was, we need this.
[00:38:36.912 --> 00:38:49.081]  And it's a good thing, but it said it gives near total autonomy and power to a private, secretive, non-reviewable board run by the Federal Reserve, made up by the heads of the top banks and brokerage firms.
[00:38:49.741 --> 00:38:56.086]  And it will, quote, deal with winding down the $600 trillion in derivatives.
[00:38:56.906 --> 00:38:57.947]  That's a conservative number.
[00:38:59.969 --> 00:39:01.430]  The entire GDP is $14 trillion a year.
[00:39:04.773 --> 00:39:13.859]  The average American already owes over $200,000 for the bailout and government expenditures and commitments, and that's a conservative number as well.
[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:24.765]  President Obama took on House GOP leader John Boehner's call for repealing the financial reform bill before it signed yesterday.
[00:39:27.587 --> 00:39:33.191]  But Boehner's call was backed by the GMA and Richard Shelby, the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee.
[00:39:33.919 --> 00:39:34.839]  We would like to repeal it.
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:41.881]  We have empowered a lot of regulatory bodies that failed us before, and the question is, what have we learned?
[00:39:42.081 --> 00:39:49.183]  He said, it's going, and it's not going to create jobs, which we desperately need, it's going to cut jobs, it's going to hurt the economy.
[00:39:49.603 --> 00:39:58.685]  Yes, in there, every debit card transaction, every sale you make, everything you do, I mean, what was in the last stimulus package?
[00:40:00.473 --> 00:40:06.080]  Oh, 50-something billion dollars to pay GM to move to Brazil, Eastern Europe, and China.
[00:40:06.761 --> 00:40:07.582]  Billions of the money.
[00:40:07.602 --> 00:40:08.803]  I mean, that's mainstream headlines.
[00:40:09.624 --> 00:40:12.568]  GM bailout money used to move plant to Brazil.
[00:40:12.648 --> 00:40:13.549]  Search that headline.
[00:40:17.847 --> 00:40:22.230]  Here's just one of the things that was in the stimulus, and this new one is just riddled with this stuff as well.
[00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:32.057]  Obesity rating for every American must be included in stimulus mandated electronic health records, says Health and Human Services, Cyber News Service.
[00:40:33.698 --> 00:40:37.540]  Tracking how much you weigh, they're already doing that through the schools, to then tax you if you're overweight.
[00:40:37.881 --> 00:40:42.284]  They admit they're now going to do that and say what you can put in a child's happy meal.
[00:40:42.564 --> 00:40:44.045]  Oh, it's okay for McDonald's to put
[00:40:45.385 --> 00:40:46.965]  Silicone in the food.
[00:40:46.985 --> 00:40:48.526]  That's CNN.
[00:40:49.166 --> 00:40:49.946]  A petrochemical.
[00:40:50.106 --> 00:40:51.026]  Extremely poisonous.
[00:40:52.827 --> 00:40:53.747]  Illegal in England.
[00:40:54.667 --> 00:40:55.388]  And other countries.
[00:40:55.948 --> 00:40:57.908]  But you can't put a toy in there.
[00:40:57.928 --> 00:40:59.068]  See, it's all about control.
[00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:09.151]  Congress acts, but bank bill has work ahead, is what AP says.
[00:41:09.231 --> 00:41:11.772]  Oh yes, don't expect things to get better now that they've done this.
[00:41:11.812 --> 00:41:12.632]  No, it's going to get worse.
[00:41:14.608 --> 00:41:15.889]  China reduces U.S.
[00:41:15.949 --> 00:41:19.170]  Treasury debt holdings in the month of May.
[00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:23.152]  We always find out a few months later what they've done.
[00:41:23.572 --> 00:41:24.833]  China reduced its holdings in U.S.
[00:41:24.873 --> 00:41:30.515]  Treasury debt in May as a total foreign holdings of government debt posted a slight increase.
[00:41:31.976 --> 00:41:34.717]  And they've openly announced that they're downgrading U.S.
[00:41:34.837 --> 00:41:41.580]  Treasury bonds, debt that they're buying, from the bankers and that they're moving to the SDRs.
[00:41:44.281 --> 00:41:54.331]  See, now that we've had globalism and denaturalization, we still have the dollars, we could buy all the precious Chinese slave goods made by people living in lockdown concentration camps.
[00:41:54.371 --> 00:41:56.813]  That was in the AP yesterday, like it was no big deal.
[00:41:57.814 --> 00:42:01.718]  Yes, everybody's locked up at night in these worker neighborhoods, not allowed to come out.
[00:42:02.839 --> 00:42:07.644]  But, you know, if they come out, they're sent to a re-education center, but that's how you have law and order.
[00:42:09.616 --> 00:42:16.738]  That's right out of The Running Man, where they're running around through the city and you see the big billboard telescreen saying, anyone caught out after dark will be permanently detained.
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:22.200]  Dollar extends losses on U.S.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:23.661]  economy concerns.
[00:42:24.704 --> 00:42:26.125]  This is out of the French News Agency.
[00:42:26.145 --> 00:42:31.508]  The dollar fell further Friday, touching the lowest level so far of the year against the yen, as weak U.S.
[00:42:31.528 --> 00:42:34.930]  data fueled concerns about the world's biggest economy, analysts said.
[00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:37.592]  They're now announcing that we're going to implode.
[00:42:38.072 --> 00:42:40.413]  Now, we know the globals were engineering an implosion.
[00:42:41.214 --> 00:42:43.235]  And people are now saying, wow, the media is being honest.
[00:42:43.635 --> 00:42:49.839]  Yes, but they're telling you the solution is more power for these people, and they're now announcing it to run the market down themselves.
[00:42:52.125 --> 00:42:55.307]  There's another great article by The Economic Collapse up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:42:55.347 --> 00:42:59.590]  Will thousands of police layoffs unleash chaos and anarchy across America?
[00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:17.341]  Gee, in Ohio, in California, in Michigan, in Florida, in New York, Illinois, I'm seeing the reports, the government coming out and saying we won't respond to normal crime, robberies, people being poisoned by design, people sabotaging power poles, robbing cars.
[00:43:17.921 --> 00:43:21.262]  We're not going to respond to identity theft, embezzlement, extortion.
[00:43:21.783 --> 00:43:23.343]  Gee, what do you think criminals are going to do?
[00:43:25.424 --> 00:43:26.845]  Here's a CNBC report.
[00:43:27.205 --> 00:43:30.466]  Consumer sentiment sinks to lowest level in 11 months.
[00:43:33.987 --> 00:43:35.708]  Here's another one from before it's news.
[00:43:36.208 --> 00:43:37.549]  Upcoming false flag.
[00:43:37.869 --> 00:43:39.870]  Put options placed on energy companies.
[00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:45.112]  Just as three days before 9-11 there was an unusual amount of trading going on with American Airlines.
[00:43:47.145 --> 00:43:50.795]  We are seeing the same type of action this time with power companies.
[00:43:51.497 --> 00:43:55.126]  This is Obama supporters saying active terrorism is the only thing that will save them.
[00:43:57.355 --> 00:44:05.860]  And in the Market Watch report, which is a division of News Corp, says unusual volume of put contracts was traded today.
[00:44:06.561 --> 00:44:11.144]  There were 713 put contracts versus the 10-day average of 55.
[00:44:11.824 --> 00:44:14.366]  On the call side, 27 call contracts were traded.
[00:44:14.406 --> 00:44:18.088]  Today's trade put call ratio at 26.41.
[00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:24.693]  There were 26.41 puts traded for each call contract on Power Company.
[00:44:24.733 --> 00:44:26.634]  So we'll continue to watch that.
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:37.382]  So that is just some of the economic news.
[00:44:39.523 --> 00:44:45.565]  There's another report from the Dollar Vigilante that says, how and why the world financial system has to collapse
[00:44:51.257 --> 00:44:55.139]  Well, it has to collapse because it's designed to collapse.
[00:44:55.179 --> 00:45:06.024]  They've created thousands of times more counterfeit derivatives and financial fraud instruments than there is real assets in the world.
[00:45:06.385 --> 00:45:08.986]  Even if you inflated assets thousands of times.
[00:45:11.897 --> 00:45:15.158]  In their value, artificially, it wouldn't meet the derivatives.
[00:45:15.818 --> 00:45:17.219]  This is a financial weapon.
[00:45:17.259 --> 00:45:18.379]  This is a black hole.
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:24.522]  It's designed to render you down to a bankrupt surf.
[00:45:28.143 --> 00:45:32.665]  And Webster Tarpley has an excellent report on this up at Infowars.com.
[00:45:32.805 --> 00:45:40.788]  Obama, Dodd, Frank are now
[00:45:42.435 --> 00:45:51.578]  Protecting the derivatives curb out until 2022 and that's in the financial reform bill.
[00:45:52.899 --> 00:46:01.682]  And see they've changed semantics to where the average person thinks when they hear the term overhaul or reform that it means it's something good.
[00:46:02.802 --> 00:46:07.604]  But if Titus in 70 A.D.
[00:46:08.405 --> 00:46:11.946]  sacked Jerusalem and overturned
[00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:18.793]  Every structure, and didn't leave one stone standing on another, not one brick sitting on another.
[00:46:20.794 --> 00:46:28.078]  Just as Christ pointed to the Pharisees and said, within your lifetime, not a single one of these stones will be standing on top of another.
[00:46:28.459 --> 00:46:30.119]  And that temple will be destroyed.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:37.524]  The point is, should Titus have called the destruction of Jerusalem an overhaul?
[00:46:40.405 --> 00:46:41.066]  A reform?
[00:46:42.577 --> 00:46:44.608]  And I've said it before, if you run out into I-35 traffic...
[00:46:46.291 --> 00:46:58.936]  Let's say, high noon, when traffic's flowing at 80 miles an hour, and you see an 18-wheeler coming down the road, and it's 30 yards away, and you jump out in front of the 18-wheeler, and at 80 miles an hour it hits you, there's almost a 100% chance you're going to die.
[00:46:59.497 --> 00:47:06.599]  And your body is going to be smashed and run over and look like Sloppy Joe's for 100 yards down the road as it drags your body.
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:08.240]  Your body is going to be in parts.
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:10.401]  Your guts are going to be smeared all over the road.
[00:47:11.081 --> 00:47:12.282]  Now, that is a reform!
[00:47:15.174 --> 00:47:26.882]  If I take a sculpture of clay, a beautiful sculpture, of say a falcon, and I take a rubber mallet hammer to it and bash it into a flat pancake, that is a reform.
[00:47:28.644 --> 00:47:41.132]  If you take your arm and stick it in a blender, an industrial blender on high, and chop it off to your wrist and hold your arm up with red blood gouting and founting and spraying out, that is a reform.
[00:47:41.152 --> 00:47:42.353]  Your hand has been reformed.
[00:47:42.653 --> 00:47:44.515]  It is in the blender, in pieces.
[00:47:46.971 --> 00:47:57.587]  When I took that iPad to illustrate that people only care about machines and not fellow humans because we've been dehumanized and desensitized, and I took a power drill to it and then a hammer, I reformed it.
[00:47:58.789 --> 00:48:01.490]  So yes, they're reforming the international system.
[00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:02.831]  They're reforming the dollar.
[00:48:03.151 --> 00:48:04.592]  They're reforming the family.
[00:48:04.852 --> 00:48:08.474]  They're reforming our trade, and our industry, and our society.
[00:48:08.534 --> 00:48:22.221]  And yes, green jobs and carbon taxes, in its own statements from the UN, Club of Rome, Council on Foreign Relations, Royal Commission, all state, it is designed to bring you down to the level of bankrupt slaves. 110%.
[00:48:27.366 --> 00:48:29.007]  These people want to wreck things.
[00:48:29.027 --> 00:48:30.188]  They want to make you dependent.
[00:48:30.428 --> 00:48:31.488]  They want to conquer you.
[00:48:33.149 --> 00:48:36.691]  Your genetic code is being reformed by all the poisons and toxins.
[00:48:38.552 --> 00:48:39.413]  Just search the term
[00:48:42.501 --> 00:48:47.124]  Gene damage, or human DNA damage, growing exponentially.
[00:48:47.305 --> 00:48:49.166]  Because they can study the births in real time.
[00:48:50.026 --> 00:48:57.812]  And these western nations, everywhere where you eat GMO food, everywhere where you eat food with all these preservatives, they aren't just bad for you.
[00:48:58.352 --> 00:48:59.353]  What does bad for you mean?
[00:48:59.393 --> 00:49:00.114]  It means deadly.
[00:49:01.595 --> 00:49:02.395]  It means harmful.
[00:49:02.415 --> 00:49:07.219]  You know what mercury does to your DNA?
[00:49:08.715 --> 00:49:10.858]  Rob Dew brought me a mainstream news article today.
[00:49:10.878 --> 00:49:20.093]  I mean, I knew that Washington Post reported years ago that half of soft drinks have high levels of mercury in them.
[00:49:20.874 --> 00:49:23.518]  I knew that most of the crops we eat are full of mercury.
[00:49:24.884 --> 00:49:34.390]  But he brought one in about how children's fruit bowls, those pre-prepared fruit bowls and fruit juices, are filled with levels of mercury that are off the charts.
[00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:37.431]  I mean, you might as well go eat swordfish every day.
[00:49:37.771 --> 00:49:38.552]  It'd be better for you.
[00:49:43.134 --> 00:49:49.095]  There's mercury, there's lead, it's in the crops, it's in the food, it's in everything.
[00:49:50.076 --> 00:50:06.679]  You can search lead in children's foods, mercury in children's foods, but if there's a much lower level in a children's toy, they'll have a big recall, everyone will gather around and get scared, and the government will have billboards up warning you, everything's about how they care about you and they want to help you.
[00:50:06.899 --> 00:50:10.020]  They'll always focus on some little bitty thing that isn't really a problem.
[00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:11.400]  Comparatively.
[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:15.181]  And then ignore the giant problems.
[00:50:16.642 --> 00:50:19.363]  But there's lead, mercury, arsenic, it's all in there.
[00:50:19.583 --> 00:50:23.864]  Because do you know what they do with the distillates from oil production?
[00:50:24.984 --> 00:50:29.605]  All the things they can't use that are toxic waste, they mix it with fertilizer, hundreds of chemicals.
[00:50:31.126 --> 00:50:37.508]  And they then spray it as fertilizer onto the crops and plants
[00:50:38.559 --> 00:50:39.240]  Are very good.
[00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:44.183]  In fact, they use corn to detoxify land that's had problems.
[00:50:44.764 --> 00:50:47.405]  They will suck it up and then you eat it.
[00:50:50.007 --> 00:50:53.050]  They will suck it up and you eat it.
[00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:59.734]  Now, does LeBron James and Lindsay Lohan and Mel Gibson really matter now?
[00:51:00.935 --> 00:51:03.117]  Does your waistline really matter?
[00:51:03.157 --> 00:51:03.337]  No.
[00:51:03.757 --> 00:51:04.498]  Fighting these people does.
[00:51:05.356 --> 00:51:09.637]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:04.884 --> 00:52:09.746]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:09.847 --> 00:52:10.627]  What have we got?
[00:52:10.847 --> 00:52:12.968]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:13.288 --> 00:52:14.009]  A republic.
[00:52:14.289 --> 00:52:16.870]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:18.851]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:19.211 --> 00:52:21.112]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:21.232 --> 00:52:22.493]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:22.913 --> 00:52:24.034]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:24.234 --> 00:52:24.634]  Children?
[00:52:24.834 --> 00:52:25.614]  Our education?
[00:52:25.955 --> 00:52:26.595]  Our money?
[00:52:26.795 --> 00:52:30.437]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:30.797 --> 00:52:34.462]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:34.502 --> 00:52:35.444]  You are being warned!
[00:52:35.764 --> 00:52:36.605]  We have the facts.
[00:52:36.805 --> 00:52:37.907]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:37.967 --> 00:52:38.848]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:38.868 --> 00:52:39.709]  We have common law.
[00:52:39.749 --> 00:52:42.012]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:42.293 --> 00:52:44.996]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[00:52:45.237 --> 00:52:46.058]  Rise of the Republic.
[00:52:46.158 --> 00:52:50.941]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:52:51.121 --> 00:52:52.481]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:52:52.622 --> 00:52:53.442]  Don't tread on me.
[00:52:53.702 --> 00:53:00.566]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:53:04.773 --> 00:53:09.014]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:53:09.335 --> 00:53:09.935]  Number one.
[00:53:10.235 --> 00:53:13.396]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:53:13.656 --> 00:53:14.236]  Number two.
[00:53:14.516 --> 00:53:19.078]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:53:19.418 --> 00:53:19.878]  It's true.
[00:53:20.158 --> 00:53:24.700]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:25.561]  Number 3.
[00:53:25.841 --> 00:53:29.124]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:53:29.444 --> 00:53:33.187]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:53:33.348 --> 00:53:33.908]  Number 4.
[00:53:34.148 --> 00:53:36.530]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:53:36.911 --> 00:53:40.294]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:53:40.594 --> 00:53:40.794]  Number 5.
[00:53:41.395 --> 00:53:45.298]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:53:45.539 --> 00:53:50.303]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:53:50.583 --> 00:53:54.607]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:53:54.747 --> 00:53:56.309]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:53:56.529 --> 00:53:58.611]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:53:58.791 --> 00:54:01.134]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:54:30.393 --> 00:54:32.736]  And the sun is gonna burn into a cinder.
[00:54:32.756 --> 00:54:37.843]  Before we ever pass this way again.
[00:54:37.863 --> 00:54:40.126]  And we're gonna rise.
[00:54:54.944 --> 00:54:58.474]  Okay, we're gonna start the second hour.
[00:55:04.264 --> 00:55:08.808]  And I'm going to go to Tim, TJ, Eddie, Tim, Ronnie, and others.
[00:55:08.848 --> 00:55:13.832]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:55:13.852 --> 00:55:18.736]  Bob Chapman's coming up in the third hour today to talk about the economy.
[00:55:19.296 --> 00:55:23.319]  Coming up, also, BP says they've stopped the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:28.684]  But we've got screenshots of their cameras down there.
[00:55:31.206 --> 00:55:36.828]  Looks like there may be some hanky-panky going on, but we are looking into it right now and working on that.
[00:55:36.888 --> 00:55:41.450]  But if this is true, praise God, this is certainly wonderful news.
[00:55:42.370 --> 00:55:48.012]  But we'll be talking about that and discussing it coming up after we go through a bunch of your phone calls.
[00:55:48.872 --> 00:55:57.496]  Also, the head of the United Arab Emirates, their ambassador says, country, Maybach, a U.S.-Israeli attack on Iran.
[00:55:58.576 --> 00:56:05.083]  This is very serious news out of Der Spiegel and also the Saudi Arabia newspapers and Business Insider.
[00:56:05.924 --> 00:56:08.387]  So we're going to be breaking that down coming up.
[00:56:09.128 --> 00:56:11.871]  Another economic report here from Yahoo Finance.
[00:56:11.911 --> 00:56:12.291]  The U.S.
[00:56:12.311 --> 00:56:13.553]  middle class is being wiped out.
[00:56:14.013 --> 00:56:16.216]  Here's the stats to prove it.
[00:56:17.893 --> 00:56:20.434]  And we'll also then get into Kagan.
[00:56:20.454 --> 00:56:24.955]  There may be a filibuster of her if Senator Jeff Sessions decides to take action.
[00:56:25.735 --> 00:56:38.519]  We need to put pressure on Senator Sessions, who's done some pretty good work in the past, one of the better senators up there, and say, look, you have a duty to filibuster this monster who's anti-free speech and Second Amendment and private property and anti-family.
[00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:41.320]  It doesn't matter if she still gets confirmed.
[00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:43.641]  You have a responsibility to expose her
[00:56:44.361 --> 00:56:44.601]  I don't
[00:57:07.193 --> 00:57:08.735]  But that's coming up.
[00:57:09.076 --> 00:57:10.858]  Your phone calls when we start the next hour.
[00:57:10.918 --> 00:57:13.902]  Don't forget, all of this is possible because of your support.
[00:57:14.223 --> 00:57:22.213]  When you buy the books, the videos, the t-shirts, all the ball caps, the materials, and the videos, the books, and the ball caps, and all of it gets the word out.
[00:57:22.774 --> 00:57:29.256]  And educate you to a higher level, so you can wake others up, and you can pass them on, make copies of all my films.
[00:57:29.716 --> 00:57:35.098]  We carry a lot of other great books and videos, and they're all posted, of course, at PrisonPlanet.tv for members there as well.
[00:57:35.398 --> 00:57:37.399]  But don't forget the online video bookstore shopping cart.
[00:57:37.719 --> 00:57:39.720]  We couldn't do any of this without you, Infowars.com.
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:42.121]  And lastly, I want to tell you...
[00:57:43.121 --> 00:57:45.983]  About inner food, botanicals.
[00:57:46.263 --> 00:57:47.563]  We live in a toxic environment.
[00:57:47.603 --> 00:57:53.446]  Daily we are bombarded with chemtrails, fluorides, pesticides, and other equally toxic chemicals.
[00:57:53.486 --> 00:57:58.309]  The folks on the Gulf Coast now worry about benzene, all the rest of the toxins.
[00:57:58.509 --> 00:58:02.951]  It's important to get a superfood, 20 superfoods, where your body absorbs it.
[00:58:03.091 --> 00:58:04.552]  I use it, my wife uses it.
[00:58:05.232 --> 00:58:08.094]  Inner food helps build your body's defenses and helps rid toxins.
[00:58:08.874 --> 00:58:12.098]  You can try the Alex Jones Combo with the coconut milk powder.
[00:58:12.138 --> 00:58:13.039]  It's all organic.
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:16.023]  I love the NutriCafe coffee, but the Interfood's the key.
[00:58:16.524 --> 00:58:17.565]  They're super green food.
[00:58:18.026 --> 00:58:19.788]  E-N-E-R, food.com.
[00:58:19.888 --> 00:58:21.250]  Interfood.com.
[00:58:21.571 --> 00:58:23.133]  Banners on infowars.com.
[00:58:23.453 --> 00:58:24.935]  Interfood.com or give them a call.
[00:58:27.385 --> 00:58:27.525]  866-762-9238.
[00:58:27.545 --> 00:58:27.885]  866-762-9238.
[00:58:28.605 --> 00:58:32.448]  Innerfood.com.
[00:58:33.188 --> 00:58:34.469]  Great folks there.
[00:58:34.829 --> 00:58:42.853]  So bolster your immune system and your cellular structure against the onslaught that the eugenicists have launched against us and our families.
[00:58:42.873 --> 00:58:48.677]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:49.237 --> 00:58:52.499]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:59.411]  Tyranny is here.
[00:58:59.731 --> 00:59:03.314]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:59:03.614 --> 00:59:05.876]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:59:05.896 --> 00:59:11.340]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:59:11.781 --> 00:59:18.026]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:59:18.426 --> 00:59:23.971]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:59:24.412 --> 00:59:28.075]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:59:28.595 --> 00:59:32.599]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:59:32.879 --> 00:59:38.404]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:59:38.824 --> 00:59:41.807]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:59:42.387 --> 00:59:43.829]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:59:44.369 --> 00:59:44.810]  It's here.

[00:59:57.401 --> 00:59:59.323]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:59.783 --> 01:00:02.566]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.284 --> 01:00:13.486]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:14.126 --> 01:00:14.946]  You want answers?
[01:00:15.706 --> 01:00:16.607]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:17.247 --> 01:00:20.908]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:21.448 --> 01:00:25.490]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.841 --> 01:00:28.582]  We're back live.
[01:00:28.602 --> 01:00:32.424]  Thank you for joining us into hour number two of this Friday edition.
[01:00:33.285 --> 01:00:35.086]  Your phone calls are coming up momentarily.
[01:00:35.987 --> 01:00:40.710]  The globalists are lining up all their ducks to launch an attack on Iran.
[01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:41.690]  More on that coming up.
[01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:46.674]  More on the economy as the middle class is being eradicated and even mainstream news is reporting on it.
[01:00:47.114 --> 01:00:52.238]  We're looking into BP's claim, because they've done this many times, that they have stopped the oil leak in the Gulf.
[01:00:52.918 --> 01:00:59.123]  We're looking at the pressure readings and other things that are public and doing some research on that, so that's coming up later in the hour.
[01:00:59.563 --> 01:01:01.765]  But right now, let's go back to your phone calls.
[01:01:02.166 --> 01:01:03.467]  Tim in Michigan, you're on the air.
[01:01:04.427 --> 01:01:06.469]  Hey Alex, I hope you can hear me today.
[01:01:06.749 --> 01:01:07.270]  Yes, I can.
[01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:08.811]  Okay, good.
[01:01:08.891 --> 01:01:11.313]  Yeah, I was having a little trouble with a new phone yesterday.
[01:01:11.393 --> 01:01:14.796]  Thanks for letting me get back with you again this week.
[01:01:15.396 --> 01:01:17.198]  You know, I don't know how you do it, but
[01:01:17.785 --> 01:01:45.612]  You hit on a talking point that not a lot of times people will bring up, and what you had mentioned this morning, earlier, before I got through to talk to you, was about how once you obtain this information, and the truth, basically, how much it does change your outlook on how you value your life, and then, I can honestly say it,
[01:01:46.562 --> 01:02:04.752]  My life hasn't been the same and sometimes I might even be asking for some advice here, buddy, but sometimes it's really hard to find some balance and to try to even maintain a reasonable amount of what I got given right by the Constitution.
[01:02:07.136 --> 01:02:08.396]  You know, my right to be happy.
[01:02:08.676 --> 01:02:10.417]  Well, listen, listen, listen, Tim.
[01:02:10.457 --> 01:02:11.737]  We got out of balance.
[01:02:12.677 --> 01:02:19.798]  Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Thomas Paine, Patrick Henry, they all said you must guard the jewel of liberty.
[01:02:20.138 --> 01:02:22.139]  You must do everything you can in its defense.
[01:02:23.079 --> 01:02:25.159]  It is, you know, of the prime importance.
[01:02:25.299 --> 01:02:28.540]  Even if you struggle to keep freedom, you're probably going to lose it.
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.120]  And you will go into bondage.
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:33.761]  And the worst elements of society will take over.
[01:02:34.341 --> 01:02:38.144]  And so we've gotten out of balance as a society, becoming decadent, fat and happy.
[01:02:38.444 --> 01:02:39.725]  So the evil crept in.
[01:02:40.005 --> 01:02:41.486]  Now we're going back into bondage.
[01:02:41.767 --> 01:02:44.689]  The blessings of liberty we're now losing.
[01:02:45.129 --> 01:02:48.251]  And so, what did Barry Goldwater say?
[01:02:48.291 --> 01:02:51.754]  Extremism in defense of liberty is no vice.
[01:02:52.174 --> 01:02:54.836]  There is no such thing as being out of balance.
[01:02:54.876 --> 01:02:55.216]  We need the 100%
[01:02:57.478 --> 01:03:00.759]  Effort in waking people up, in reaching out to people.
[01:03:01.159 --> 01:03:02.999]  That doesn't mean you don't spend time with your family.
[01:03:03.019 --> 01:03:14.241]  But when I'm spending time with my family out at the lake fishing, or at a local park, or on a hike and bike trail, or water coloring, sitting on the floor, I just get closer to God.
[01:03:14.341 --> 01:03:17.202]  I see their innocence, their beauty, their goodness, their wholesomeness.
[01:03:17.802 --> 01:03:23.923]  And so my mind's really split while I'm thinking about them, and loving them, and nurturing them, and loving my wife.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:33.225]  I'm also thinking about how I've got to oppose evil and having brainstorms of different ways I can warn people.
[01:03:33.845 --> 01:03:43.511]  And what's interesting is ten years ago, I've been married for almost nine, but ten years ago, even six, seven years ago, I would still see a beautiful woman in a grocery store and lust.
[01:03:44.472 --> 01:03:47.534]  I would still have a lot of flesh.
[01:03:47.654 --> 01:03:50.996]  And now, almost all of that is burned away.
[01:03:52.022 --> 01:04:06.238]  I mean, I'm attracted to my wife, but still, my drive states are fully survival, warn people, deal with this, you know, protect my children, and... Anything else, Tim?
[01:04:07.319 --> 01:04:10.543]  Yeah, just a couple real quick things here.
[01:04:12.189 --> 01:04:34.796]  You were talking about what people look at as important these days and when I crack open my Yahoo page, which is my homepage, they have this thing called Trending Now and you'll see stuff like Lindsay Lohan, American Idol, Raw Wrestling, Dancing with the Stars, and then the sixth thing at the end of the very last
[01:04:36.797 --> 01:04:44.780]  You know, that's a great point.
[01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:46.981]  What is that trend you're looking at?
[01:04:47.021 --> 01:04:49.202]  Google trends, or what is it?
[01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:56.805]  You know, I meant to write a story about that.
[01:04:56.825 --> 01:04:59.346]  I'm going to talk about it when we come back.
[01:04:59.386 --> 01:05:00.066]  Great points, Tim.
[01:05:00.086 --> 01:05:00.667]  God bless you.
[01:05:01.727 --> 01:05:03.148]  You are in balance, Tim.
[01:05:03.928 --> 01:05:04.428]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:04.448 --> 01:05:08.390]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:05:08.631 --> 01:05:14.654]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:05:15.034 --> 01:05:18.916]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me
[01:05:19.116 --> 01:05:22.117]  How much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry and dishes.
[01:05:22.417 --> 01:05:26.999]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving, triple concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:05:27.279 --> 01:05:35.782]  Get a free detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[01:05:35.942 --> 01:05:39.683]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:05:40.202 --> 01:05:46.384]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:05:46.965 --> 01:05:50.386]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:05:50.866 --> 01:05:58.189]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:05:58.289 --> 01:05:58.749]  Thank you.
[01:06:06.052 --> 01:06:09.693]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:10.013 --> 01:06:18.135]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:06:18.875 --> 01:06:22.916]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:06:23.496 --> 01:06:34.318]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:06:34.958 --> 01:06:43.960]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:49.501]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:06:49.902 --> 01:06:57.063]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:57.383 --> 01:07:00.124]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:07:03.916 --> 01:07:08.159]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:09.080]  Number 1.
[01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:12.543]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:12.803 --> 01:07:13.363]  Number 2.
[01:07:13.664 --> 01:07:18.227]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:19.008]  It's true.
[01:07:19.308 --> 01:07:23.871]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:24.172 --> 01:07:24.712]  Number 3.
[01:07:25.012 --> 01:07:28.295]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:28.595 --> 01:07:32.298]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:32.478 --> 01:07:33.038]  Number four.
[01:07:33.278 --> 01:07:35.639]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:36.039 --> 01:07:39.421]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:39.721 --> 01:07:40.261]  Number five.
[01:07:40.521 --> 01:07:44.443]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:44.663 --> 01:07:49.425]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:49.705 --> 01:07:53.746]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:53.886 --> 01:07:55.447]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:55.667 --> 01:08:00.269]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:08:00.849 --> 01:08:01.429]  We've got it.
[01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:11.575]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:08:11.675 --> 01:08:14.997]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:08:16.058 --> 01:08:21.741]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:08:26.863 --> 01:08:32.947]  It is Friday, 16th day of July, 2010.
[01:08:34.648 --> 01:08:42.392]  Humanity is under attack by a scientific technocracy hell-bent on exterminating at least 80% of the world population.
[01:08:43.153 --> 01:08:44.794]  They're building the kill grid right now.
[01:08:45.374 --> 01:08:48.396]  All of the mass poisoning and genetic engineering has only been a test.
[01:08:49.249 --> 01:08:51.612]  The real war is about to begin.
[01:08:52.353 --> 01:08:55.197]  Prepare yourselves and get right with your creator.
[01:08:56.499 --> 01:08:58.681]  And that doesn't mean I'm on some high horse here.
[01:08:59.242 --> 01:09:04.870]  The reason I don't like to drink, and I like to drink as much as anybody, is because that's when I find myself
[01:09:08.502 --> 01:09:09.903]  Lusting after other women.
[01:09:09.943 --> 01:09:13.086]  That's when I find myself not thinking about fighting the New World Order.
[01:09:13.366 --> 01:09:19.771]  That's when I find myself cussing and allowing corrupt thoughts into my mind and not being focused.
[01:09:20.472 --> 01:09:26.036]  And it's the same thing when I immerse myself in Hollywood movies and distractions that the world puts out there.
[01:09:26.436 --> 01:09:34.603]  None of us are perfect, but we have to realize the better traits in humanity and reach for those instead of just giving in to corruption.
[01:09:35.953 --> 01:09:43.496]  Now, Tim brought up something that has really been on my heart heavily, a key tool in the InfoWar that we have not used.
[01:09:45.277 --> 01:09:59.943]  Now, in the last decade, many times, Paul Watson, and in the last four or five years, Kurt working with us, Kurt Nemo, and others, have written blurbs at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com
[01:10:02.512 --> 01:10:12.814]  When films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, or The Obama Deception, or the name Alex Jones, gets into the top 10 of Google Trends or Yahoo Trends.
[01:10:13.574 --> 01:10:15.294]  And you'll see how it's a news item normally.
[01:10:15.614 --> 01:10:24.196]  They kind of feedback loop it and feed into it when it's Lindsay Lohan, or when it's something like the scandal with Mel Gibson.
[01:10:24.456 --> 01:10:31.697]  The media hypes that, oh look, you know, the number one trend is Facebook.
[01:10:33.163 --> 01:10:34.184]  Or Chubacabra?
[01:10:34.524 --> 01:10:35.384]  Or Mel Gibson?
[01:10:36.225 --> 01:10:37.326]  Or Kelly Osborne?
[01:10:38.926 --> 01:10:44.610]  And the BP oil spill is way down the line.
[01:10:48.472 --> 01:10:54.636]  Unemployment extension 2010 is number 15 on Yahoo Trends.
[01:10:56.497 --> 01:10:57.778]  That should be number one.
[01:10:59.699 --> 01:11:01.480]  Lead and mercury in our children's
[01:11:02.563 --> 01:11:06.084]  Juice drinks, and chips, and food, and soft drinks.
[01:11:06.144 --> 01:11:06.984]  That's all admitted.
[01:11:07.224 --> 01:11:08.944]  Your children are drinking this en masse.
[01:11:09.264 --> 01:11:10.965]  That should be the top trend.
[01:11:16.026 --> 01:11:20.027]  Now, what if we actually gamed their corrupt system?
[01:11:20.167 --> 01:11:24.708]  What if every listener of this show today and tomorrow
[01:11:26.227 --> 01:11:32.714]  And on Sunday and Monday typed the Obama deception into Yahoo and into Google search engines.
[01:11:33.055 --> 01:11:37.720]  What if you did it over and over and over and over and over and over and over again?
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:45.729]  That would put the Obama deception, links to the video for people to watch it for free,
[01:11:47.079 --> 01:12:00.281]  That would put links to that at the top of Google and at the top of Yahoo, and tens of millions more would see it on top of the 25 to 30 million that have conservatively seen it for free online.
[01:12:00.301 --> 01:12:14.164]  I mean, you can go to Yahoo and see it on their video, watch 5 million times, go to YouTube, see it, watch 6 million here, 2 million there, a million there, 500,000 here, the BitTorrents list, it's been seen millions of times per major system.
[01:12:15.333 --> 01:12:19.856]  What if you all, right now, went to a search engine box?
[01:12:19.896 --> 01:12:21.517]  Let's show people live on TV.
[01:12:22.278 --> 01:12:28.923]  Radio listeners can just go to Google, go to Yahoo, go to the biggest search engines, and type in, The Obama Deception.
[01:12:29.623 --> 01:12:31.024]  The Obama Deception.
[01:12:31.725 --> 01:12:35.247]  Type in, The Obama Deception, and this'll probably work.
[01:12:35.307 --> 01:12:38.790]  It'll probably push it into the top trends, maybe even number one, and the next week,
[01:12:41.781 --> 01:12:45.784]  I can put out a viral video, say, on genetic engineering causing DNA damage.
[01:12:46.184 --> 01:12:48.966]  We can create a simple term for people to search.
[01:12:53.177 --> 01:12:58.220]  And then millions of new people, because of that information warfare tool, will see it.
[01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:08.946]  Now, going back three years ago, Google even admitted this, that on any given day, the number one video on Google Video would be one of my films.
[01:13:09.326 --> 01:13:16.290]  Or it'd be Loose Change or another Patriot film, like America, Freedom to Fascism, by Aaron Russo.
[01:13:17.491 --> 01:13:21.013]  Most of the time, our videos were number one, and so because they were number one,
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:25.863]  It would exponentially grow to some cases millions of views a day.
[01:13:26.223 --> 01:13:29.886]  Then Google made the hit counter secret for the public.
[01:13:29.946 --> 01:13:31.288]  If you had an account, you could still see it.
[01:13:31.308 --> 01:13:35.611]  We go, my gosh, 25 million views on Endgame, but the public couldn't see it.
[01:13:35.931 --> 01:13:42.617]  And they just started putting up what was popular that they made up, not what was number one in the top slot.
[01:13:43.484 --> 01:13:46.825]  They found out that we basically had dominated that.
[01:13:46.865 --> 01:13:48.305]  We had dominated the new media.
[01:13:48.545 --> 01:13:49.265]  And we've done this.
[01:13:49.345 --> 01:13:52.146]  We've won on the level playing field, so they cheat.
[01:13:52.486 --> 01:13:58.147]  So before they start cheating this system, we need to game their system right now.
[01:13:58.427 --> 01:14:03.788]  So everyone, everyone, in fact, I'll do it right now on my studio computer, then I'm going back to your calls.
[01:14:03.808 --> 01:14:07.689]  But the caller, the last caller, Tim in Michigan, brought this up.
[01:14:08.449 --> 01:14:11.370]  So I'm going to go to Google here.
[01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:29.958]  Google.com and I'm going to type the Obama deception, the Obama deception in and then I'm going to click on a link.
[01:14:31.358 --> 01:14:38.662]  And the first link that comes up is 6,468,347 views on the Change the Channel version of it.
[01:14:39.202 --> 01:14:40.563]  Now I'm going to back out of this channel.
[01:14:41.403 --> 01:14:43.324]  I'm going to click on the second link.
[01:14:45.285 --> 01:14:47.926]  This is a link with 830,000 views.
[01:14:48.646 --> 01:14:49.626]  Another YouTube channel.
[01:14:49.666 --> 01:14:51.147]  And there's literally hundreds of channels that have it.
[01:14:51.447 --> 01:14:54.527]  I'm gonna click on a Google Video link.
[01:14:57.668 --> 01:14:58.709]  I'm gonna let that load.
[01:15:02.190 --> 01:15:08.871]  So it's important to click on the links to drive them up, but it's also important to search the term, the Obama deception.
[01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:13.413]  Now, why is that so important to search, the Obama deception?
[01:15:13.973 --> 01:15:14.673]  I made the film.
[01:15:15.874 --> 01:15:23.079]  Starting in November of 2009, 2008, excuse me, when Obama was elected.
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:35.188]  I had it basically done by the time he was inaugurated, and I laid out everything he would do, how Bush works for the same people, how the banks would take over society, how the bailout was a robbery.
[01:15:36.209 --> 01:15:39.271]  And what the globalists are doing and how the Bilderberg Group selected Obama.
[01:15:39.572 --> 01:15:42.934]  People need to see this to know the economic collapse is orchestrated.
[01:15:43.234 --> 01:15:49.199]  And the film is evergreen because people see something made over a year and a half ago, it freaks them out.
[01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:53.342]  When they're watching it and I'm making all these predictions and it's all happened.
[01:15:54.283 --> 01:15:57.405]  And I'm laying out the real political paradigm of the globalists.
[01:15:57.765 --> 01:15:59.387]  So I'm asking all of you right now.
[01:16:01.172 --> 01:16:05.913]  Go to Google, and then go to Yahoo, separately on their search systems, and type the Obama deception in.
[01:16:05.933 --> 01:16:09.474]  Then close your browser, or retype it in, and do it over and over again.
[01:16:09.735 --> 01:16:15.676]  If all of you will do it, at least ten, fifteen times apiece, that'll probably take you three or four minutes to do.
[01:16:15.696 --> 01:16:26.840]  If you'll give three or four minutes, I'll guarantee you it'll be the number one, or at least in the top two or three links, we can go above the Mel Gibson distraction, above the Lindsay Lohan distraction.
[01:16:28.556 --> 01:16:33.298]  In many of these lists we were looking at during the break, the BP oil spill isn't even in the top ten.
[01:16:35.419 --> 01:16:36.920]  That's how these distractions work.
[01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:38.881]  You know, I culture jammed last week.
[01:16:39.361 --> 01:16:50.786]  I knew full well that that was going to get, conservatively, I said that'll get a half a million views the next week, just on one version, the video we upload, where I talk about LeBron James being a distraction, and how people worshipped him.
[01:16:52.421 --> 01:17:06.547]  And how, as the society implodes, and as the foreign banks are taking over, that people are distracted by this, and the media pushes it as a distraction, telling you, as a social creature, that this is what is most important, using social engineering programming.
[01:17:07.647 --> 01:17:21.413]  And the video, conservatively, with the different versions I spent a few minutes looking at, has had close to 800,000 views total, just on the top 15 or so sites I looked at on different video systems that have posted it, that have ripped it and copied it.
[01:17:23.007 --> 01:17:25.874]  800,000 views conservatively in a week.
[01:17:26.696 --> 01:17:29.001]  We posted it last Thursday evening.
[01:17:30.284 --> 01:17:31.226]  Went viral Friday.
[01:17:32.406 --> 01:17:36.549]  I mean, I shot a five and a half minute video.
[01:17:36.849 --> 01:17:38.310]  Took Aaron a few hours to edit it.
[01:17:38.671 --> 01:17:39.451]  He uploaded it.
[01:17:40.072 --> 01:17:40.452]  Boom!
[01:17:41.413 --> 01:17:43.674]  800,000 people seeing real issues.
[01:17:43.694 --> 01:17:45.015]  And it really wasn't about LeBron James.
[01:17:45.276 --> 01:17:47.738]  Once they watched the video, it was the foreign banks are doing this to you.
[01:17:47.918 --> 01:17:49.059]  This is a globalist takeover.
[01:17:49.099 --> 01:17:52.021]  Here they are saying they're getting rid of the dollar as the world reserve currency.
[01:17:52.361 --> 01:17:54.703]  It had a major effect, so I'm begging you.
[01:17:55.874 --> 01:17:59.177]  I meant to do this in the past and had the idea many times for years, just never did it.
[01:17:59.817 --> 01:18:01.238]  We're going to do this today.
[01:18:01.399 --> 01:18:03.120]  The Obama Deception.
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:09.325]  And then you can email me and write me and next week you can tell me what term you think we should put up that's most important.
[01:18:11.006 --> 01:18:12.668]  The Obama Deception.
[01:18:13.308 --> 01:18:13.589]  Simple.
[01:18:13.709 --> 01:18:15.230]  The Obama Deception.
[01:18:15.770 --> 01:18:21.135]  T-H-E-O-B-A-M-A-D-E-C-E-P-T-I-O-N.
[01:18:22.036 --> 01:18:23.477]  The Obama Deception.
[01:18:24.656 --> 01:18:33.043]  And you just go to YouTube, you type it in, that'll help drive it to the top, you go to Google, you type it in, you go to Yahoo, you type it in.
[01:18:34.224 --> 01:18:42.851]  You type it in to those search engines, and you do it again tomorrow, and you do it again the next day, because those are trends, and it will go to the top.
[01:18:42.911 --> 01:18:46.454]  Let's show the New World Order the power of the resistance.
[01:18:49.076 --> 01:18:50.337]  Let's show them what we can do.
[01:18:52.369 --> 01:18:53.110]  I'll guarantee you.
[01:18:53.670 --> 01:18:59.094]  I mean, is it worth it for you to go spend five minutes over and over again typing the Obama deception into different search engines?
[01:19:00.334 --> 01:19:02.876]  To drive it up to number one so millions of people can see it?
[01:19:03.236 --> 01:19:09.141]  Can we collectively work against the globalist collective monster to defend our individual liberty and our future?
[01:19:09.861 --> 01:19:11.022]  Can we flex our muscles?
[01:19:11.102 --> 01:19:11.902]  Will we do this?
[01:19:12.303 --> 01:19:13.724]  The Obama deception.
[01:19:14.673 --> 01:19:16.035]  The Obama deception.
[01:19:16.676 --> 01:19:17.478]  And it's the same thing.
[01:19:18.119 --> 01:19:18.900]  Get a DVD.
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:20.002]  Buy a DVD copy.
[01:19:20.022 --> 01:19:20.743]  That supports us.
[01:19:20.783 --> 01:19:21.785]  It makes this show possible.
[01:19:21.965 --> 01:19:22.867]  It's in the highest quality.
[01:19:22.887 --> 01:19:23.888]  It has the expanded extras.
[01:19:24.730 --> 01:19:25.551]  Make copies of it.
[01:19:25.591 --> 01:19:26.292]  Give it to people.
[01:19:27.327 --> 01:19:32.770]  I've seen university students, in the case in Phoenix and other places, give out more than 30,000 copies.
[01:19:33.370 --> 01:19:36.271]  They got less than 50 students together, they all made copies, got out over 30,000.
[01:19:36.331 --> 01:19:38.892]  That was all over the news when that happened.
[01:19:39.052 --> 01:19:40.213]  It happened at other universities.
[01:19:40.853 --> 01:19:42.794]  We gotta fight in cyberspace and on the street.
[01:19:43.274 --> 01:19:44.215]  I'm gonna come back, I promise.
[01:19:44.935 --> 01:19:45.776]  And I'm going to take calls.
[01:19:45.916 --> 01:19:49.958]  Towards the end of the hour, I'm going to get into a bunch of news on the BP situation, the Iran situation.
[01:19:49.978 --> 01:19:52.300]  But ladies and gentlemen, the Obama deception.
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:53.740]  The Obama deception.
[01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:56.322]  All these people will see that as the top trend.
[01:19:56.602 --> 01:19:59.924]  That will push it to be the top of Google and Yahoo.
[01:20:00.204 --> 01:20:01.565]  That will push it in front of millions.
[01:20:01.945 --> 01:20:03.266]  Let's not reach millions a month.
[01:20:03.306 --> 01:20:04.387]  Let's reach millions a day.

[01:22:33.448 --> 01:22:34.529]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:34.689 --> 01:22:39.072]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:39.272 --> 01:22:44.976]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:45.076 --> 01:22:48.478]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:48.718 --> 01:22:51.600]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:53.582 --> 01:22:56.343]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[01:23:54.141 --> 01:23:54.321]  It works!
[01:24:10.489 --> 01:24:12.490]  Matt Ryan just made another great point.
[01:24:13.411 --> 01:24:18.415]  Over 200 million people a day look at the Twitter trends.
[01:24:19.235 --> 01:24:20.216]  He pulled up those numbers.
[01:24:21.697 --> 01:24:25.300]  Out on your Twitter accounts, tell everybody, go watch the Obama deception.
[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:31.564]  Send them to the 6 million plus view version on YouTube.
[01:24:32.505 --> 01:24:33.786]  Do the same thing with Facebook.
[01:24:33.846 --> 01:24:36.528]  Please, everybody on your Facebook, post at the top and say,
[01:24:37.631 --> 01:24:42.013]  Watch the Obama deception and post the video and send it out to your friends.
[01:24:43.494 --> 01:24:45.635]  This is the power of the alternative media.
[01:24:45.675 --> 01:24:46.236]  Let's do it.
[01:24:46.556 --> 01:24:48.637]  Google, Yahoo, Twitter, Facebook.
[01:24:48.957 --> 01:24:49.678]  Those are the keys.
[01:24:49.718 --> 01:24:50.498]  Let's do it together.
[01:24:51.078 --> 01:24:52.899]  Let's go ahead and talk to TJ in Minnesota.
[01:24:52.919 --> 01:24:53.740]  You're on the air, TJ.
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:54.300]  Thanks for holding.
[01:24:55.341 --> 01:24:56.341]  Alex, can you hear me?
[01:24:56.641 --> 01:24:57.422]  I can, TJ.
[01:24:57.942 --> 01:25:01.004]  Alex Emery Jones, you're quite a fireball today.
[01:25:01.024 --> 01:25:03.065]  Say, I got a
[01:25:03.723 --> 01:25:07.165]  Question and a suggestion and a comment.
[01:25:07.225 --> 01:25:09.287]  I hope you'll bear with me for all three.
[01:25:10.107 --> 01:25:13.249]  The question is, what's the name of your French bulldog?
[01:25:14.130 --> 01:25:15.351]  His name is Captain.
[01:25:16.111 --> 01:25:16.692]  I love it.
[01:25:16.992 --> 01:25:17.492]  I love it.
[01:25:19.393 --> 01:25:32.422]  And the suggestion is that you, in compliance with all your listeners, realize that the world is grossly underpopulated
[01:25:33.624 --> 01:25:40.730]  Because these bastardos have been killing people and you don't have to use rocket science or Twitter or Google or anything.
[01:25:40.751 --> 01:25:46.115]  Well, if you fly in an airplane in any direction, you see almost no towns, roads or civilization.
[01:25:46.656 --> 01:25:49.919]  Humans have this distortion because we're in megacities.
[01:25:50.299 --> 01:25:52.800]  Well, my point is, you and I are in total, complete, a hundred and
[01:26:19.938 --> 01:26:22.080]  Ninety percent agreement with that.
[01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:32.108]  And we need a guest on your show that's a real scientist or a real statistician that can tell you about the population in the United States.
[01:26:32.628 --> 01:26:44.538]  Albert Lee, Minnesota, which is a Mexican city long before illegal immigration, they cannot hold their population because of
[01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:49.961]  And also, I was waiting for you to hit a talk point that I could really relate to.
[01:26:50.661 --> 01:26:53.521]  And you mentioned the United Arab Emirates.
[01:26:53.581 --> 01:26:54.582]  And I'll tell you about them.
[01:26:54.602 --> 01:26:59.482]  I knew Sheikh Zayed Al Nahyan and I knew his wife.
[01:27:15.330 --> 01:27:15.930]  I don't know.
[01:27:36.761 --> 01:27:40.223]  Wants to make war with enemy, enemy, anybody.
[01:27:40.263 --> 01:27:46.268]  But you know, they are one branch of Islam, and they historically don't like the Shiite Iran.
[01:27:47.028 --> 01:27:50.871]  And so, the Saudi Arabian government has been making pro-war noises.
[01:27:50.891 --> 01:27:57.936]  I know that's a separate country, but it borders the UAE, if my geography's correct.
[01:27:57.976 --> 01:27:58.916]  That's correct, isn't it?
[01:28:00.437 --> 01:28:03.920]  UAE is different than Saudi, and Saudi is bad.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:05.741]  No, no, but I'm saying it borders it.
[01:28:06.866 --> 01:28:07.506]  I know that.
[01:28:07.866 --> 01:28:08.847]  Well, no, I know you know that.
[01:28:08.867 --> 01:28:10.107]  I'm just going from memory here.
[01:28:10.187 --> 01:28:11.568]  It's there, south of it.
[01:28:11.608 --> 01:28:12.488]  It's one of the Emirates.
[01:28:14.109 --> 01:28:17.210]  That's like Iowa to Minnesota, and they're two different cultures.
[01:28:18.291 --> 01:28:19.111]  Sir, sir, listen.
[01:28:19.211 --> 01:28:22.052]  Listen, I don't claim to be an expert on the United Arab Emirates.
[01:28:22.172 --> 01:28:29.535]  I was reading Der Spiegel, UAE ambassador, says country may back a U.S.-Israeli attack on Iran.
[01:28:29.875 --> 01:28:31.856]  I mean, I defer to your knowledge.
[01:28:32.276 --> 01:28:35.058]  But it's not by their own volition entirely.
[01:28:35.078 --> 01:28:35.818]  It's due to
[01:28:36.914 --> 01:28:38.376]  The UAE is what on the
[01:29:00.333 --> 01:29:05.355]  Eastern shore of Saudi Arabia, north of Oman.
[01:29:05.575 --> 01:29:07.956]  It is right there on the Persian Gulf.
[01:29:08.416 --> 01:29:11.377]  And so that's why they are a little paranoid about Iran having a nuke.
[01:29:12.658 --> 01:29:18.120]  Well, they're all there for many sovereign generations.
[01:29:19.161 --> 01:29:22.302]  They were the citadel of wisdom and peace.
[01:29:23.522 --> 01:29:25.523]  And getting along with everybody.
[01:29:25.844 --> 01:29:27.245]  No, I know it's a big trading post.
[01:29:27.265 --> 01:29:30.146]  Very wealthy and developed a lot of science there.
[01:29:30.567 --> 01:29:32.608]  And I'm just reading what the ambassador said.
[01:29:32.648 --> 01:29:33.909]  But let's pray that's the case.
[01:29:34.349 --> 01:29:35.770]  Because I don't want World War III to start.
[01:29:35.810 --> 01:29:36.851]  I appreciate your call.
[01:29:37.511 --> 01:29:39.833]  And everybody knows my French Bulldog's name.
[01:29:40.213 --> 01:29:41.314]  But good to hear from you, TJ.
[01:29:41.374 --> 01:29:41.694]  OK.
[01:29:42.294 --> 01:29:45.016]  I'm going to go to Eddie, Tim, Ronnie, Angel Eyes.
[01:29:45.757 --> 01:29:47.958]  Is that from The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly?
[01:29:47.978 --> 01:29:50.079]  Oh, look at the little Angel Eyes.
[01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:52.041]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:54.844 --> 01:29:57.830]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:58.771 --> 01:30:01.456]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:04.366 --> 01:30:06.047]  Hi folks, it's time to play.
[01:30:06.347 --> 01:30:08.329]  Good food makes everything you do fun.

[01:31:04.403 --> 01:31:09.266]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:31:09.386 --> 01:31:10.147]  What have we got?
[01:31:10.367 --> 01:31:12.488]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:31:12.828 --> 01:31:13.549]  A republic.
[01:31:13.829 --> 01:31:16.410]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:31:16.471 --> 01:31:18.392]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:31:18.732 --> 01:31:20.633]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:31:20.753 --> 01:31:22.034]  So they think they own our land?
[01:31:22.454 --> 01:31:23.575]  They think they own our water?
[01:31:23.755 --> 01:31:24.155]  Children?
[01:31:24.375 --> 01:31:25.156]  Our education?
[01:31:25.496 --> 01:31:26.096]  Our money?
[01:31:26.317 --> 01:31:29.979]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:31:30.339 --> 01:31:35.005]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:31:35.305 --> 01:31:36.126]  We have the facts.
[01:31:36.326 --> 01:31:37.447]  We have the Constitution.
[01:31:37.487 --> 01:31:38.369]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:31:38.409 --> 01:31:39.250]  We have common law.
[01:31:39.290 --> 01:31:41.532]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:41.813 --> 01:31:45.577]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:31:45.677 --> 01:31:50.480]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:52.021]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:31:52.141 --> 01:31:52.982]  Don't tread on me.

[01:33:00.765 --> 01:33:01.526]  Check them out today.
[01:33:13.683 --> 01:33:15.544]  Hey Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[01:33:15.564 --> 01:33:19.526]  Hey, I was watching the History Channel today and it was totally brainwashing propaganda.
[01:33:40.717 --> 01:33:44.078]  They didn't mention anything about Timothy McVeigh working for the FBI.
[01:33:44.098 --> 01:33:53.562]  They made it look like, you know, that the Patriot Movement is just another, you know, it's just, we're a bunch of, according to them, we're just a bunch of neo-Nazis, which it's not true.
[01:33:53.642 --> 01:33:54.482]  It's not true at all.
[01:33:55.983 --> 01:33:56.923]  I mean, what do you expect?
[01:33:56.983 --> 01:34:05.326]  That's why cable television and broadcast TV are literally dying, because people understand it's a bunch of propaganda and brainwashing.
[01:34:06.089 --> 01:34:12.251]  I mean, yeah, right, I mean, that's what, I mean, believe it or not, Nazi Germany, I mean, they did that kind of propaganda.
[01:34:12.831 --> 01:34:16.793]  It's like, well, these Jews are going to commit acts of terrorism, we better shut them down.
[01:34:17.533 --> 01:34:19.614]  They are threatening the fear.
[01:34:20.574 --> 01:34:23.995]  That's exactly what the Soviets and Pol Pot and everybody else did.
[01:34:24.375 --> 01:34:26.476]  We know what we're seeing historically.
[01:34:26.536 --> 01:34:27.616]  We know this is tyranny.
[01:34:28.416 --> 01:34:28.557]  Yep.
[01:34:29.057 --> 01:34:35.719]  And also, now you covered how the elite funded Adolf Hitler and the Nazi war machine, but
[01:34:36.758 --> 01:34:46.942]  Could you also talk about how the Rockefellers also funded the Imperial Japanese, because they were as sadistic as the Nazis, especially in the rape of Nanking.
[01:34:46.962 --> 01:34:47.862]  Have you ever heard of that?
[01:34:47.922 --> 01:34:48.522]  Yes, I have.
[01:34:48.542 --> 01:34:49.863]  Well, that's actually true.
[01:34:49.883 --> 01:35:00.186]  I mean, the Rockefellers were one of the most wealthy families on the Earth 110 years ago, and they did fund the war machine of the Japanese, and we did send the U.S.
[01:35:00.226 --> 01:35:05.128]  military over there to train the Japanese, and then green-lighted them to have a war with Russia.
[01:35:06.325 --> 01:35:15.092]  They of course were our ally in World War I. Then they got double-crossed in the late 1930s and then into 1941.
[01:35:15.133 --> 01:35:17.535]  And I'm not saying the Imperial Japanese were good, they were bad.
[01:35:17.555 --> 01:35:22.179]  The American people were very moral, so were the Japanese, but our rulers were evil.
[01:35:22.959 --> 01:35:25.020]  And thousands of U.S.
[01:35:25.060 --> 01:35:29.303]  troops went into, quote, private military arms funded by the U.S.
[01:35:29.343 --> 01:35:38.129]  government, hundreds of aircraft, the best-known Flying Tigers, and were attacking the Japanese all over Asia, but predominantly in China.
[01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:40.570]  And the Japanese did public protest.
[01:35:40.650 --> 01:35:42.912]  Their embassy protested for several years.
[01:35:43.572 --> 01:35:45.674]  Then there was an oil embargo against Japan.
[01:35:46.634 --> 01:35:47.494]  And the U.S.
[01:35:47.554 --> 01:35:56.578]  is making noises about attacking Japanese-controlled countries, and so Japan decided to do a sneak attack to knock out our Pacific Fleet.
[01:35:57.158 --> 01:36:01.199]  Their midget submarines, four of them, attacked that morning, two hours before.
[01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:03.200]  They launched the attack two hours before.
[01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:13.244]  Several, one got into the harbor, another ran into reefs about a mile away from the harbor, another got off course and came up on land, and another was sunk, and that's CNN.
[01:36:14.144 --> 01:36:14.965]  In fact, guys, search this.
[01:36:15.005 --> 01:36:15.787]  I said do this a few days ago.
[01:36:15.807 --> 01:36:17.590]  I don't know if you saw it.
[01:36:17.610 --> 01:36:18.471]  CNN.com.
[01:36:19.513 --> 01:36:20.995]  Did the United States start...
[01:36:22.025 --> 01:36:22.685]  Pearl Harbor.
[01:36:22.986 --> 01:36:24.867]  Or did the United States attack Japan first?
[01:36:24.887 --> 01:36:28.509]  And then they show an image of the submarine on the bottom and say, the U.S.
[01:36:28.549 --> 01:36:31.511]  sunk this midget submarine, I think they said an hour and a half before.
[01:36:31.531 --> 01:36:37.954]  I mean, the point is, the Japanese were coming to attack, but when subs were attacking, the Navy was ordered to stand down still.
[01:36:38.195 --> 01:36:43.698]  Because they wanted that full image of dead sailors and airmen and Marines.
[01:36:44.238 --> 01:36:45.279]  But I appreciate your call.
[01:36:46.519 --> 01:36:48.099]  I cover that in my film, Terror Storm.
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:50.120]  In Terror Storm, we have the CNN article.
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:51.920]  But see, I already knew this.
[01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:57.542]  As a child, we would come and visit my grandparents here in Austin.
[01:36:57.562 --> 01:36:58.582]  My mother's from Austin.
[01:36:59.942 --> 01:37:05.844]  And we would, I remember when I was probably 10 years old, because I loved war museums, they took me to the Pacific War Museum.
[01:37:05.884 --> 01:37:07.564]  It's the official war museum.
[01:37:07.604 --> 01:37:09.004]  It's gotten a lot bigger than it was then.
[01:37:09.425 --> 01:37:11.405]  It was the old home of Admiral Nimitz.
[01:37:12.245 --> 01:37:14.986]  Landlocked in Fredericksburg, Texas, 200 miles from the coast.
[01:37:15.968 --> 01:37:17.309]  And it was a hotel.
[01:37:18.069 --> 01:37:26.675]  And the building, it's a big building, is shaped like the bow of a ship sticking out on Main Street there.
[01:37:27.515 --> 01:37:32.298]  And now it's the George Herbert Walker Bush Pacific U.S.
[01:37:32.338 --> 01:37:32.718]  Museum.
[01:37:32.778 --> 01:37:35.520]  That is the museum for the Pacific War in the U.S.
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:40.203]  And they've got one of the midget subs, and it was there when I was a kid,
[01:37:42.106 --> 01:37:43.026]  And hidden in plain view.
[01:37:43.046 --> 01:37:44.967]  They didn't point out that we attacked the Japanese.
[01:37:45.007 --> 01:37:48.807]  It just said that morning they sunk this Japanese sub and three others.
[01:37:50.388 --> 01:38:00.150]  And you can go there and see one of the subs that was attacking or coming into attack and got sunk but still Pearl Harbor was ordered to stand down.
[01:38:00.450 --> 01:38:02.630]  I mean they just hide the treason in plain view.
[01:38:02.931 --> 01:38:06.651]  Does that take away from the heroism of the people that fought off the Japanese attack?
[01:38:06.991 --> 01:38:08.512]  Or those that died on the
[01:38:10.171 --> 01:38:10.772]  Battleships?
[01:38:11.032 --> 01:38:11.252]  No.
[01:38:11.752 --> 01:38:15.755]  The point is, the truth is the truth is the truth is the truth is the truth, and it's now declassified.
[01:38:15.775 --> 01:38:16.136]  The U.S.
[01:38:16.176 --> 01:38:19.718]  had broken the Japanese purple and blue code and knew exactly what they were going to do weeks before.
[01:38:20.219 --> 01:38:24.923]  It took weeks for that task force to steam from Japan into that area of the Pacific.
[01:38:25.183 --> 01:38:26.284]  That's way across the Pacific.
[01:38:26.344 --> 01:38:30.967]  If you look at the map, here's Japan, here's Hawaii, here's the West Coast of the United States.
[01:38:30.987 --> 01:38:32.388]  They had to come all the way.
[01:38:32.909 --> 01:38:34.170]  And the aircraft and the U.S.
[01:38:34.210 --> 01:38:37.793]  submarines and all the islands we control, they all knew they were coming.
[01:38:38.479 --> 01:38:39.999]  And they were ordered to stand down and die.
[01:38:40.700 --> 01:38:42.300]  Okay, that's how compartmentalization works.
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:47.702]  The average guys out there, you know, playing volleyball on the deck of the battleships, they had no idea.
[01:38:47.802 --> 01:38:49.562]  But the Navy was ordered, you stand down.
[01:38:50.902 --> 01:38:52.423]  Radar installations picked up.
[01:38:52.483 --> 01:38:54.083]  The plane's coming in an hour before.
[01:38:54.103 --> 01:38:55.023]  Ordered to stand down.
[01:38:55.864 --> 01:38:58.865]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tim in Washington.
[01:38:58.885 --> 01:38:59.665]  You're on the air, Tim.
[01:39:01.125 --> 01:39:01.285]  Yes.
[01:39:01.925 --> 01:39:02.866]  Alex, how you doing today?
[01:39:03.106 --> 01:39:03.786]  I'm doing all right, sir.
[01:39:03.806 --> 01:39:04.066]  Welcome.
[01:39:04.932 --> 01:39:09.017]  Hey, I've got a couple points for you and maybe a question and an idea as well.
[01:39:09.958 --> 01:39:13.682]  Have you considered calling for Infowarriors to meet and organize en masse?
[01:39:13.922 --> 01:39:19.228]  And if you have, and you haven't considered it, how dangerous or viable would that be?
[01:39:20.029 --> 01:39:24.654]  It'd be very viable, sir, but I have always decided to
[01:39:26.178 --> 01:39:27.698]  I've done some rallies, some events.
[01:39:28.419 --> 01:39:29.479]  I've gone to events.
[01:39:29.939 --> 01:39:48.185]  I've been invited to speak with Ron Paul in Houston and haven't gone because I go, I say to myself, is it better to get in a car and drive four hours and stay in a hotel or is it better to stay here and go on international television and do radio interviews and make my own videos that reach hundreds of millions?
[01:39:49.258 --> 01:40:09.824]  And so it just, bang for the buck, bang for the energy buck, for my time and energy, it's better to sit here and just inform people about what's happening, point out solutions, states' rights, abolishing the Fed, things like that, and then supporting groups like We Are Change and the Liberty meetups that go on with the Campaign for Liberty.
[01:40:10.664 --> 01:40:12.584]  I mean, I've never wanted to be the big leader.
[01:40:13.405 --> 01:40:16.966]  Not just because that's even more dangerous to do, that is part of it in the back of my mind,
[01:40:19.758 --> 01:40:25.981]  Because the time, the energy, this radio show has power because we do it every day.
[01:40:26.362 --> 01:40:28.823]  And we put out media every day for 15 years.
[01:40:30.524 --> 01:40:31.845]  And it's powerful info.
[01:40:32.645 --> 01:40:35.967]  But my mission is to wake people up and to empower them, not
[01:40:38.959 --> 01:40:57.589]  Not to just go out and say we're going to have events everywhere, or we're going to... I mean, I promote other activists who say, you know, tax-free 15, or protest the IRS, or go out and confront Al Gore everywhere he goes, to where he won't go out in public now, and everywhere people go and confront him, it ends up being in the media that he's a liar.
[01:40:58.410 --> 01:41:01.351]  I mean, I just have a different strategic view.
[01:41:03.612 --> 01:41:04.333]  We are building.
[01:41:06.523 --> 01:41:06.784]  Yes, sir.
[01:41:18.595 --> 01:41:18.795]  Thank you.
[01:41:37.935 --> 01:41:39.936]  What I want to do is just get people together.
[01:41:40.536 --> 01:41:46.398]  I believe it's not so much going to even be a dating site, it's going to have something similar to that just for get your communities together.
[01:41:46.678 --> 01:41:48.338]  Create communities of family.
[01:41:49.359 --> 01:41:50.519]  Meet like-minded people.
[01:41:50.839 --> 01:41:51.899]  That's the true value.
[01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:57.741]  That's more valuable than all the gold in the hills is good friends and people who are like-minds coming together.
[01:41:58.622 --> 01:41:59.642]  But does that answer your question?
[01:42:00.582 --> 01:42:01.403]  It kind of does, yes.
[01:42:01.983 --> 01:42:05.864]  I also had a suggestion or maybe an idea for anybody else out there that
[01:42:06.314 --> 01:42:18.457]  Maybe organizing a kind of an MLK march to Washington, a civil disobedience of non-participation, where we just travel and march and just see how many people actually show up.
[01:42:18.477 --> 01:42:26.680]  Well, that's a good idea, but there have been hundreds of marches just in the last year, and the media tries to ignore it, but the alternative media covers it, and so it is having an effect.
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:30.981]  There isn't going to be one silver bullet, but everybody just putting one foot in front of the other.
[01:42:31.701 --> 01:42:33.341]  And I appreciate your call, great points.
[01:42:34.222 --> 01:42:35.422]  Just the power of you
[01:42:37.179 --> 01:42:41.203]  Creating a one-line slogan on a website and putting it on power poles in your town.
[01:42:42.484 --> 01:42:45.346]  Chances are the Orwellian state will try to block you.
[01:42:45.887 --> 01:42:48.029]  And then that censorship will get it all over the news.
[01:42:48.730 --> 01:42:56.717]  How dare someone, the media always takes the bait, how dare someone put up signs of Obama as a joker with the word fascism or Infowars.com under it.
[01:42:56.957 --> 01:42:58.378]  We need to arrest whoever did this.
[01:42:59.139 --> 01:43:00.780]  And then they send a cop to the guy's house.
[01:43:00.820 --> 01:43:03.520]  It happened in Texas, Florida, England.
[01:43:03.841 --> 01:43:04.661]  Then it becomes news.
[01:43:04.741 --> 01:43:05.741]  Why are you censoring?
[01:43:05.961 --> 01:43:07.322]  Then more people go out and do it.
[01:43:07.542 --> 01:43:09.102]  That became an international phenomenon.
[01:43:09.342 --> 01:43:11.083]  Reached hundreds of millions of people conservatively.
[01:43:11.303 --> 01:43:13.664]  Was in hundreds of newscasts, hundreds of newspapers.
[01:43:15.644 --> 01:43:16.925]  The local newspaper in...
[01:43:18.325 --> 01:43:23.288]  Kyle, you know, talked about how it was evil and horrible and had it on its front cover and made more people go out and do it.
[01:43:23.789 --> 01:43:25.630]  I mean, it's just, it's unlimited.
[01:43:26.490 --> 01:43:29.572]  Start a website, start a radio blog, call into talk shows.
[01:43:30.073 --> 01:43:31.914]  None of us are going to fix this overnight.
[01:43:31.994 --> 01:43:42.101]  It is a movement, a renaissance, an enlightenment, an awakening, a journey back to freedom, a rediscovery of the spirit of 1776, a rediscovery of the spirit of liberty.
[01:43:44.053 --> 01:43:47.035]  All right, let's go fast now through calls, because I want to hit a bunch of news before this hour ends.
[01:43:47.435 --> 01:43:49.737]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ronnie N. Tejas.
[01:43:49.757 --> 01:43:52.319]  You're on the air, Ronnie.
[01:43:52.779 --> 01:43:54.120]  Thank you, sir, for everything.
[01:43:54.540 --> 01:44:00.064]  And yes, the Kenyan-born Indonesian subject, so-called President, so-called Barack Obama, i.e.
[01:44:00.444 --> 01:44:04.287]  Barry Sotaro's sickening slide to tyranny, is in full blast.
[01:44:04.787 --> 01:44:05.648]  It's happening, people.
[01:44:06.673 --> 01:44:16.116]  Therefore, in the meanwhile, with joy, Alex, I speak whenever allowed to the Austin City Council of Criminals about toxic sludge, peace and freedom, medicinal marijuana, etc.
[01:44:16.556 --> 01:44:19.357]  But now, and that's only 25% of the time they let me.
[01:44:19.397 --> 01:44:34.621]  Curiously, these criminals, they suspend my... Yeah, first they let people only have citizen communications by signing up a week before, then they start letting you only speak every, what, three weeks, and next you won't be able to speak, period.
[01:44:35.799 --> 01:44:37.141]  Well, 75% of the time.
[01:44:37.402 --> 01:44:41.489]  And every week, though, I can address the Travis County Commissioner's Court for a whopping 180 seconds.
[01:44:41.649 --> 01:44:43.072]  Yeah, you know how to go speak.
[01:44:43.112 --> 01:44:46.378]  You can go speak on agenda items separately.
[01:44:47.205 --> 01:44:53.329]  I do that as much as I can, and I carry my political signs in the background, but they won't let me do that, only when I speak.
[01:44:53.549 --> 01:44:58.973]  Well, the Austin City Council is a lawless group of criminals, looting and robbing the people of Austin.
[01:44:58.993 --> 01:44:59.673]  There's no doubt.
[01:44:59.953 --> 01:45:00.674]  They are globalists.
[01:45:01.054 --> 01:45:08.959]  $2.6 billion in taxes in the next three years on energy, more than doubling the cost, bigger than all the other tax increases combined.
[01:45:09.299 --> 01:45:10.040]  Total evil.
[01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:11.961]  They all need to be run on a rail.
[01:45:12.001 --> 01:45:13.742]  They are a group of scallywags.
[01:45:13.782 --> 01:45:14.623]  I appreciate your call.
[01:45:15.003 --> 01:45:16.124]  They are a fraud.
[01:45:16.864 --> 01:45:19.725]  Let's talk to Angel Eyes in Texas.
[01:45:19.745 --> 01:45:20.345]  You're on the air.
[01:45:20.945 --> 01:45:21.585]  You got me.
[01:45:21.645 --> 01:45:22.785]  How you doing, Bulldog?
[01:45:23.086 --> 01:45:23.526]  Pretty good.
[01:45:24.306 --> 01:45:24.706]  Okay.
[01:45:25.546 --> 01:45:31.007]  You know, Angel Eyes is because I think my eyes see what, you know, other people don't.
[01:45:32.228 --> 01:45:46.291]  I called you about a month ago in regards to the interview with Chandra Levy's aunt with Barbara Walters about... Chandra called her a week before she disappeared and said something big's fixing to happen in America and I can't tell you about it.
[01:45:47.527 --> 01:46:09.479]  uh... you put out the uh... you know the flag that if anybody had a recording of that could they send it to you uh... i doubt anybody would have it that was like ten years ago that happened uh... i wonder could you find out who chandra levy's aunt is and interview her if she hasn't disappeared or you know died mysteriously so you're saying you saw
[01:46:10.563 --> 01:46:18.591]  Chandra Levy, the intern that was killed right before 9-11, you're saying that she said something big is about to happen, but I can't tell you.
[01:46:19.912 --> 01:46:22.515]  And you're saying you saw her say that on what show?
[01:46:23.896 --> 01:46:24.917]  On Barbara Walters.
[01:46:26.478 --> 01:46:27.820]  I believe it was Barbara Walters.
[01:46:28.140 --> 01:46:32.464]  It may have been like Leslie Stahl or one of those global reporters.
[01:46:34.036 --> 01:46:41.861]  Anyhow, uh, Sondra Levy's aunt, she was on there and she said that she was closer to Sondra than Sondra was with her own mother.
[01:46:42.502 --> 01:46:46.384]  And that Sondra called her, uh, you know, a week before she disappeared.
[01:46:46.844 --> 01:46:49.386]  And, you know, this was before they found the body.
[01:46:50.226 --> 01:46:55.570]  Like six months later in that park that had already been searched by 200 National Guard, uh, troops.
[01:46:55.670 --> 01:46:56.911]  Yeah, they found the bones.
[01:46:57.871 --> 01:46:58.272]  Okay.
[01:46:59.092 --> 01:47:00.033]  Uh, well, all right.
[01:47:00.073 --> 01:47:03.415]  Well, anyhow, irregardless, Sondra Levy's aunt.
[01:47:04.419 --> 01:47:12.725]  I just wish you could get an interview with her because now this information going out on the air, you know, the ant might disappear.
[01:47:12.765 --> 01:47:13.766]  That's a good idea.
[01:47:14.206 --> 01:47:15.807]  We'll look into it and try to get her.
[01:47:17.168 --> 01:47:23.753]  Listen, you know, you had a thing one time, you were going to have like a message recording machine where people could call in.
[01:47:24.301 --> 01:47:28.183]  Because, I mean, a lot of days I've tried to call and haven't even been able to, you know, get on.
[01:47:28.203 --> 01:47:28.383]  I know.
[01:47:28.423 --> 01:47:30.764]  What happened was we put up that comment line.
[01:47:30.804 --> 01:47:31.945]  We played some of the comments.
[01:47:32.325 --> 01:47:33.966]  We were getting like 400 a day.
[01:47:34.346 --> 01:47:36.908]  And I don't have the staff to even listen to it, so we kind of discontinued it.
[01:47:37.168 --> 01:47:37.888]  People are still calling.
[01:47:37.908 --> 01:47:39.729]  I mean, that thing is just insane.
[01:47:40.629 --> 01:47:42.911]  But we still do play a few calls from it when they come in.
[01:47:42.951 --> 01:47:47.373]  It's just, it's like, it's like trying to read the Encyclopedia Britannica every day.
[01:47:47.393 --> 01:47:49.454]  But I appreciate your call, Angel Eyes.
[01:47:50.414 --> 01:47:52.055]  Let's talk to Kyle in Oregon.
[01:47:52.075 --> 01:47:52.916]  Kyle, you're on the air.
[01:47:54.224 --> 01:47:55.965]  Hi Alex, how are you doing?
[01:47:56.785 --> 01:48:01.188]  I just wanted to make a quick point for all listeners, along with me and my family.
[01:48:01.728 --> 01:48:05.050]  You do have to relate it to a local level, not outside of Portland, Oregon here.
[01:48:05.470 --> 01:48:15.955]  We got a water report a couple months ago, and everybody that I've woken up, I've asked them to just remember to relate it to a local level, and I'll go on about this water report that was in everybody's mailbox two months ago.
[01:48:16.696 --> 01:48:20.798]  One of the first things it said was, and again there's no natural fluoride that occurs in Oregon, period.
[01:48:20.818 --> 01:48:23.159]  It said one of the first sprinkler plants
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:24.961]  Frequently asked questions.
[01:48:25.521 --> 01:48:26.602]  Is my water fluoridated?
[01:48:27.602 --> 01:48:28.303]  And it says no.
[01:48:29.564 --> 01:48:31.045]  12th and Water is not fluoridated.
[01:48:31.645 --> 01:48:38.249]  And the next sentence it goes on to say that our water system, the Bull Run water route, that goes around the filtration system.
[01:48:38.950 --> 01:48:41.572]  Point blank, they said it right there, how will it have been detected?
[01:48:42.452 --> 01:48:47.876]  But the local stores around here have pre-fluoride tablets all over the shelves for kids, children, children 12 and under.
[01:48:48.914 --> 01:48:57.496]  Oh yeah, no, it says eat fluoride, brush your teeth with it when it causes bone cancer, brain damage, retardation, it lowers the IQ.
[01:48:57.556 --> 01:49:04.838]  It's all admitted and now that we're exposing it, it's just fluoride, fluoride, fluoride, billboards, fluoride, fluoride, fluoride.
[01:49:05.478 --> 01:49:07.139]  It's the same thing with aspartame.
[01:49:07.199 --> 01:49:15.481]  We were winning the battle a decade ago when it was just in a few gums and drinks and so now it's in over 10,000 plus
[01:49:17.381 --> 01:49:18.802]  Products, it's just everywhere.
[01:49:19.202 --> 01:49:21.103]  In sugar foods, they just add it.
[01:49:21.524 --> 01:49:22.905]  It's like, oh, you don't want this.
[01:49:22.945 --> 01:49:23.785]  You're reading the label.
[01:49:23.965 --> 01:49:25.146]  We'll just put it in everything.
[01:49:25.526 --> 01:49:27.768]  Because it is a chemical attack.
[01:49:28.128 --> 01:49:29.989]  This is done by design.
[01:49:30.329 --> 01:49:32.371]  And people must face the horror of it.
[01:49:32.731 --> 01:49:35.153]  And if you're a new listener out there laughing, going, oh, sure, it's bad.
[01:49:35.413 --> 01:49:36.854]  Look, I'm telling you the truth.
[01:49:36.894 --> 01:49:37.474]  Go look it up.
[01:49:37.554 --> 01:49:38.255]  I appreciate your call.
[01:49:38.615 --> 01:49:39.115]  Good points.
[01:49:39.195 --> 01:49:39.876]  Very good points.
[01:49:41.116 --> 01:49:42.297]  Aspartame side effects.
[01:49:42.357 --> 01:49:42.918]  There they are.
[01:49:46.448 --> 01:49:47.688]  Look at all those side effects.
[01:49:48.209 --> 01:49:49.209]  Decreased vision.
[01:49:50.790 --> 01:49:51.370]  Tinnitus.
[01:49:51.470 --> 01:49:52.270]  Ring in the ears.
[01:49:53.491 --> 01:49:54.311]  Facial pain.
[01:49:55.571 --> 01:49:57.512]  Psychological and psychiatric problems.
[01:49:57.572 --> 01:49:58.152]  Anxiety.
[01:49:58.852 --> 01:49:59.973]  Personality changes.
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:03.101]  Tax the organs, everything.
[01:50:03.401 --> 01:50:03.981]  Oh my God.
[01:50:04.001 --> 01:50:06.823]  I mean, just get a terrier local water facility if they're adding it.
[01:50:06.903 --> 01:50:08.123]  About 70% of the country does.
[01:50:08.143 --> 01:50:09.384]  It's got skull and crossbones on it.
[01:50:09.644 --> 01:50:10.785]  Says causes organ failure.
[01:50:10.945 --> 01:50:12.206]  I mean, just read the stinking package.
[01:50:12.226 --> 01:50:13.626]  It's got a skull and crossbones on it.
[01:50:13.646 --> 01:50:14.967]  It's like, don't eat rat poison.
[01:50:15.007 --> 01:50:16.448]  It's got a skull and crossbones on it.
[01:50:16.788 --> 01:50:18.209]  What's a skull and crossbones mean?
[01:50:19.650 --> 01:50:22.391]  Let me just draw a picture of a skull and crossbones for you right now.
[01:50:22.411 --> 01:50:23.552]  Okay?
[01:50:28.854 --> 01:50:32.696]  Here's the skull and crossbones for people watching this later on the web.
[01:50:33.797 --> 01:50:34.997]  Make a joke out of everything.
[01:50:35.558 --> 01:50:35.978]  There it is.
[01:50:36.018 --> 01:50:36.478]  You see that?
[01:50:37.459 --> 01:50:40.541]  That's a skull and crossbones, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:41.501 --> 01:50:47.104]  And there's actually a bottle of sodium fluoride from the 50s used as bug poison.
[01:50:47.144 --> 01:50:49.005]  If roaches just walk through it, they die.
[01:50:49.606 --> 01:50:51.607]  Sodium fluoride pesticide.
[01:50:52.808 --> 01:50:56.770]  Oh, but it's for your children, and it's so outrageous, they just get away with it.
[01:50:58.072 --> 01:50:59.973]  And now they're adding it to thousands of foods.
[01:51:00.793 --> 01:51:02.333]  Aspartame, fluoride, you name it.
[01:51:02.353 --> 01:51:02.974]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:04.814 --> 01:51:08.676]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[01:51:08.716 --> 01:51:12.497]  My name is Span and I'm 68 years old and I live in Vermont.
[01:51:12.921 --> 01:51:17.384]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[01:51:17.644 --> 01:51:19.586]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[01:51:19.726 --> 01:51:21.047]  Made me feel breathless.
[01:51:21.447 --> 01:51:25.490]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[01:51:25.890 --> 01:51:26.911]  Nothing did anything.
[01:51:26.971 --> 01:51:30.933]  Heart and Body Extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[01:51:30.953 --> 01:51:34.396]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered Heart and Body Extract.
[01:51:35.076 --> 01:51:37.718]  I noticed a difference quickly, within days.
[01:51:38.158 --> 01:51:42.779]  The episodes became less frequent and by a month had completely vanished.
[01:51:43.179 --> 01:51:45.760]  Usually you find a 30-day or 60-day guarantee.
[01:51:45.980 --> 01:51:50.581]  Heart and Body Extract comes with a lifetime 100% ironclad money-back guarantee.
[01:51:50.781 --> 01:51:52.921]  Details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[01:51:52.981 --> 01:51:53.201]  Call 866-295-5305.
[01:51:53.221 --> 01:51:54.102]  866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[01:52:04.383 --> 01:52:05.645]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:05.685 --> 01:52:11.032]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:11.272 --> 01:52:15.898]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:16.299 --> 01:52:16.699]  It's true.
[01:52:16.779 --> 01:52:21.345]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:21.866 --> 01:52:26.569]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:27.090 --> 01:52:29.011]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:52:29.391 --> 01:52:34.014]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:34.194 --> 01:52:35.095]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:35.315 --> 01:52:38.077]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:38.097 --> 01:52:41.699]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:42.020 --> 01:52:44.841]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:45.202 --> 01:52:47.083]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:47.423 --> 01:52:48.344]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:51.986 --> 01:52:53.748]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:56.210 --> 01:53:00.734]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:53:01.055 --> 01:53:03.437]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:04.986 --> 01:53:08.189]  So you think the massive Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[01:53:08.750 --> 01:53:09.311]  Think again.
[01:53:10.071 --> 01:53:17.579]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen, is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:24.647]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[01:53:24.947 --> 01:53:33.177]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers on how to clean the air on boats aiding in the Gulf Cleanup.
[01:53:33.498 --> 01:53:34.439]  Do what NOAA did.
[01:53:34.619 --> 01:53:38.944]  Contact airfiltersandpurifiers.com and ask about the Health Mate Plus.

[01:54:05.632 --> 01:54:11.176]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[01:54:11.656 --> 01:54:14.318]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:15.318 --> 01:54:19.401]  I'm going to be blitzing through news while Bob Chapman is on with us.
[01:54:19.441 --> 01:54:24.665]  We'll also take calls on financial questions for Bob, and we'll get to the callers that are holding as well.
[01:54:24.685 --> 01:54:26.886]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:54:27.146 --> 01:54:31.849]  I want to hit some news here in this segment and the next, and Bob's going to join us.
[01:54:31.929 --> 01:54:32.590]  But first,
[01:54:34.662 --> 01:54:39.346]  I'm noticing that on Twitter and Facebook it is alive with the Obama deception.
[01:54:39.466 --> 01:54:50.216]  Thousands and thousands of people are flooding Twitter and Facebook by posting the Obama deception from YouTube or just the term the Obama deception.
[01:54:50.856 --> 01:54:55.040]  People are also going to Google and Yahoo and typing in the Obama deception.
[01:54:55.060 --> 01:55:01.807]  We're going to try to trend that to the top to show people the power of the alternative media and to reach millions of new people with the film.
[01:55:02.147 --> 01:55:05.391]  But we can't make future films if you don't purchase them from us.
[01:55:05.891 --> 01:55:10.996]  We have them posted in the highest quality online at PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[01:55:11.436 --> 01:55:18.764]  All of my films, the simulcast, the radio show, my book, Paul Watson's book, special reports he's doing, Kurt and Steve are starting next week.
[01:55:19.384 --> 01:55:20.705]  All of this is going on.
[01:55:21.066 --> 01:55:22.267]  We're building our TV studio.
[01:55:22.287 --> 01:55:26.831]  I'm going to give you a PrisonPlanet.tv tour of that very, very soon.
[01:55:27.732 --> 01:55:38.826]  All of this is happening, and when you purchase films like The Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, Invisible Empire, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, at Infowars.com, the hard copy DVD, you make what we do here possible.
[01:55:39.607 --> 01:55:41.849]  So I want to thank all of you that are doing that.
[01:55:41.889 --> 01:55:46.415]  And other films we carry, and that I'm in, like the great documentary
[01:55:48.377 --> 01:55:51.059]  Put out by William Lewis and Gary Franchi.
[01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:55.302]  And that is, Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, about states' rights to getting our sheriffs back.
[01:55:55.342 --> 01:55:59.065]  That's got to get out to all your local officials, all your local public servants.
[01:55:59.505 --> 01:56:00.947]  And we've got all the films discounted.
[01:56:00.987 --> 01:56:03.749]  We've got deals with free t-shirts, free films, free ball caps.
[01:56:03.789 --> 01:56:06.831]  Just check them out at InfoWars.com or call toll free and ask 888-253-3139.
[01:56:11.833 --> 01:56:16.558]  UAE ambassador says country may back a US-Israeli attack on Iran.
[01:56:16.638 --> 01:56:20.982]  I'm going to be covering that with Bob Chapman, but this story is everywhere.
[01:56:21.503 --> 01:56:25.326]  And of course we mentioned it at the start of the show, but BP stops oil leak.
[01:56:26.545 --> 01:56:27.826]  into the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:56:28.307 --> 01:56:40.016]  BP has succeeded in stopping its Gulf of Mexico leak for the first time since an accident on April 20th killed 11 men and triggered a giant oil spill boosting its shares.
[01:56:40.076 --> 01:56:44.199]  It's now boosted its shares and they're claiming that they have fixed it.
[01:56:44.219 --> 01:56:45.840]  But next hour I'm going to cover this more.
[01:56:46.641 --> 01:56:47.641]  Rob Dew pointed this out.
[01:56:47.661 --> 01:56:54.126]  I have a CNN transcript from today where they're interviewing different experts.
[01:56:55.418 --> 01:56:56.972]  And they're saying that...
[01:56:58.186 --> 01:57:04.568]  We have a considerable amount of pressure down on the reservoir, forcing the hydrocarbons up to the wellbore.
[01:57:04.968 --> 01:57:19.173]  We are looking for somewhere between 8,000 and 9,000 psi inside the capping stack, which would indicate to us that the hydrocarbons are being forced up and the wellbores are being able to withstand the pressure, and that is good news.
[01:57:19.913 --> 01:57:25.915]  If they were down at 4,000 to 5,000 to 6,000 range, that could potentially tell us that the hydrocarbons
[01:57:26.875 --> 01:57:28.616]  Are being diverted someplace else.
[01:57:28.756 --> 01:57:44.363]  Well, so if 4,000 shows that they're really diverting it somewhere else, why then do we have video feeds that have been captured, and we're trying to pull up these live, but I've had trouble.
[01:57:44.383 --> 01:57:45.803]  We're going to work on this to the next hour.
[01:57:47.164 --> 01:57:49.025]  Headline BP oil gusher stopped.
[01:57:49.105 --> 01:57:50.465]  What about the PSI?
[01:57:50.485 --> 01:57:51.045]  And it's at 2,900.
[01:57:56.121 --> 01:57:57.882]  Give me a document cam shot on this if you can.
[01:58:00.623 --> 01:58:04.304]  So, we're going to try to find out exactly what's going on with this.
[01:58:04.704 --> 01:58:09.426]  Now, I pray they've capped it, but how many times did they say they'd capped it and it was stopped?
[01:58:09.446 --> 01:58:10.726]  I mean, they said that a month in.
[01:58:11.366 --> 01:58:12.287]  They said it two months in.
[01:58:12.307 --> 01:58:13.627]  I mean, we're now, what is it, 87, 88 days?
[01:58:13.667 --> 01:58:13.987]  I don't know.
[01:58:14.007 --> 01:58:14.748]  How many days in are we?
[01:58:18.188 --> 01:58:21.309]  I mean, this is ridiculous that they've lied in the past.
[01:58:21.369 --> 01:58:25.371]  I mean, I hope that this is the case, and we'll all pray that that is the case.
[01:58:25.871 --> 01:58:30.493]  They've now got hundreds and hundreds of millions of gallons of oil in the Gulf, most of it out at sea.
[01:58:30.953 --> 01:58:34.934]  As the hurricanes come in, that's the real crisis we're facing.
[01:58:34.954 --> 01:58:41.577]  Now, I think a lot of this end-of-civilization stuff's being hyped, but we've got to continue to look at it.
[01:58:41.597 --> 01:58:42.117]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:46.598 --> 01:58:48.640]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:59:59.634 --> 02:00:02.435]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:09.266 --> 02:00:13.430]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:14.091 --> 02:00:14.892]  You want answers?
[02:00:15.672 --> 02:00:16.613]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:17.234 --> 02:00:20.918]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:21.418 --> 02:00:25.482]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.617 --> 02:00:32.018]  The United States middle class is being wiped out.
[02:00:32.318 --> 02:00:33.498]  Here's the stats to prove it.
[02:00:33.518 --> 02:00:34.738]  That's Yahoo Finance.
[02:00:35.238 --> 02:00:37.679]  We'll be talking about it with Bob Chapman coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:38.299 --> 02:00:43.360]  I'll be going through a host of news with Bob as he joins us every Friday to break down the economy.
[02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:49.421]  Then at about 45 after, Bob is going to leave us and I'm going to get into the big stack of eugenics news.
[02:00:49.501 --> 02:00:52.142]  Population reduction, population control,
[02:00:52.802 --> 02:00:53.303]  Hi Alex.
[02:01:17.401 --> 02:01:23.163]  First, I just wanted to say thank you for doing more than anybody else in the world to fight against this New World Order.
[02:01:24.103 --> 02:01:29.305]  And secondly, I actually have to disagree with you when you say that you're not smarter than average.
[02:01:29.985 --> 02:01:34.986]  You're probably way above average when it comes to intelligence, just based on your discernment.
[02:01:35.726 --> 02:01:37.947]  And it's the duty of great men to lead.
[02:01:38.767 --> 02:01:44.029]  Alex, most people go cross-eyed when they try to process the amount of input that you do on a daily basis.
[02:01:45.177 --> 02:01:49.661]  And we need to know when you're going to step up and run for political office.
[02:01:49.721 --> 02:01:56.807]  I mean, run for mayor of Austin or governor of Texas and you'll have millions of people migrating just to go vote in that election.
[02:01:57.408 --> 02:02:01.752]  You know, again, one person, I mean, even if Ron Paul said if he was elected president,
[02:02:02.443 --> 02:02:06.327]  That because he would follow the Constitution, he couldn't change everything and reverse what's happened.
[02:02:06.667 --> 02:02:11.552]  He could be a focal point and a bully pulpit to do a lot, and he's gonna run for president again, folks.
[02:02:11.572 --> 02:02:13.595]  He'll announce it in the next year, or even sooner.
[02:02:13.615 --> 02:02:22.103]  I mean, he hasn't told me that, but he says he thinks about it every day, and he understands his responsibility, and he is a statesman in a gaggle of criminal politicians.
[02:02:22.944 --> 02:02:27.527]  And so, uh, you know, I, he couldn't fix it all himself.
[02:02:27.707 --> 02:02:28.128]  I can't.
[02:02:28.728 --> 02:02:32.911]  I get a lot more done being on the radio and TV and the film, sir.
[02:02:32.971 --> 02:02:38.414]  We are having an effect with what we're doing and politics is such a dirty business.
[02:02:38.494 --> 02:02:41.837]  One time I got talked into filing for state rep and I dropped out in a week.
[02:02:42.757 --> 02:02:46.001]  Because I was getting so much support and it freaked me out and I was reading the rules.
[02:02:46.341 --> 02:02:51.446]  They've written the rules where you can't follow the law and get elected legally in the campaign rules.
[02:02:51.907 --> 02:02:53.869]  That way they can selectively enforce against you.
[02:02:56.272 --> 02:03:01.918]  So at this point, and I don't really ever intend to run for political office,
[02:03:05.086 --> 02:03:06.567]  At this point, I don't intend to do that.
[02:03:07.427 --> 02:03:09.668]  I'm just here covering the news and the information.
[02:03:10.268 --> 02:03:14.329]  I mean, we're reaching millions of people a day, millions of new people every week.
[02:03:14.710 --> 02:03:16.090]  It's growing exponentially.
[02:03:16.450 --> 02:03:18.251]  Why should we stop what's working?
[02:03:18.331 --> 02:03:19.671]  I mean, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
[02:03:21.392 --> 02:03:22.632]  Well, I don't think you'd have to stop.
[02:03:22.672 --> 02:03:25.994]  You could just do what you're doing and then have people come in and vote for you.
[02:03:27.273 --> 02:03:28.594]  It's not that you're wrong.
[02:03:28.634 --> 02:03:30.355]  I completely agree with everything you say.
[02:03:30.615 --> 02:03:35.077]  Well, Austin is incredibly corrupt because we do have 100% election fraud.
[02:03:35.418 --> 02:03:36.038]  I've proven it.
[02:03:36.078 --> 02:03:39.920]  It's been even in the paper when I've caught them back in 98 and again in 2000.
[02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:41.701]  I mean, it's just total fraud.
[02:03:41.741 --> 02:03:44.163]  That's why you can't vote them out and they're stealing everything.
[02:03:44.183 --> 02:03:47.624]  This is probably one of the most corrupt cities in the country.
[02:03:48.025 --> 02:03:51.086]  It's also the most wealthy per capita and that's why the bloodsuckers are here.
[02:03:51.487 --> 02:03:53.508]  They are looting the public.
[02:03:54.308 --> 02:03:56.291]  Uh, so, I mean, I can't even run for office here.
[02:03:56.311 --> 02:03:57.413]  There's no elections in Austin.
[02:03:58.935 --> 02:03:59.055]  Yeah.
[02:03:59.335 --> 02:03:59.876]  I'm not kidding.
[02:03:59.916 --> 02:04:02.640]  I mean, it's a, but listen, I appreciate your kind words, Matt.
[02:04:03.221 --> 02:04:04.302]  You need to run for office.
[02:04:05.063 --> 02:04:06.845]  Uh, let's talk to, well, there's no time to go to calls.
[02:04:06.865 --> 02:04:08.307]  We're about to go to break, short segment.
[02:04:08.588 --> 02:04:11.191]  We're going to come back and go to Bob Chapman.
[02:04:12.458 --> 02:04:15.821]  And we'll talk to Kyle, Matt, Wendy, Tom, and many others.
[02:04:15.841 --> 02:04:16.782]  Hey, I'm so excited.
[02:04:16.802 --> 02:04:18.684]  You know, I've had this idea for years, never done it on air.
[02:04:18.944 --> 02:04:22.187]  We've shown up in the top three of Google and Yahoo trends.
[02:04:22.207 --> 02:04:27.132]  When you do that, millions of new people see your material, but it's always some article we've written or something, which is important.
[02:04:27.392 --> 02:04:30.335]  Why not have the Obama deception be number one?
[02:04:31.376 --> 02:04:32.177]  Well, how do you do that?
[02:04:32.277 --> 02:04:36.341]  You go to Yahoo and Google search engines, you type the Obama deception in, and you do it over and over again.
[02:04:37.898 --> 02:04:40.180]  Just keep entering it in the search engine and hit enter.
[02:04:40.460 --> 02:04:41.021]  Let it load.
[02:04:41.081 --> 02:04:41.541]  Go back.
[02:04:42.022 --> 02:04:42.642]  Enter it again.
[02:04:42.662 --> 02:04:44.043]  Obama Deception.
[02:04:44.083 --> 02:04:44.804]  Obama Deception.
[02:04:44.884 --> 02:04:45.845]  The Obama Deception.
[02:04:45.985 --> 02:04:46.265]  Enter it.
[02:04:46.345 --> 02:04:46.626]  Enter it.
[02:04:46.686 --> 02:04:46.946]  Enter it.
[02:04:47.226 --> 02:04:48.367]  Send it out on Mass Tweet.
[02:04:48.407 --> 02:04:49.408]  Send it out on Facebook.
[02:04:49.768 --> 02:04:50.809]  Send it out on MySpace.
[02:04:51.150 --> 02:04:55.073]  But most importantly, Twitter, Facebook, Google, and Yahoo.
[02:04:55.453 --> 02:04:56.935]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:56.955 --> 02:04:59.837]  Hey, coming up Sunday, I'll give you a report on the success of it.
[02:04:59.857 --> 02:05:01.238]  I think it's going to be big.
[02:05:01.739 --> 02:05:03.240]  Unless they game it, we'll be right back.
[02:05:04.321 --> 02:05:08.562]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:08.882 --> 02:05:09.482]  Number one.
[02:05:09.802 --> 02:05:12.943]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:13.223 --> 02:05:13.783]  Number two.
[02:05:14.083 --> 02:05:18.624]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:18.964 --> 02:05:19.404]  It's true.
[02:05:19.704 --> 02:05:24.265]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:24.585 --> 02:05:25.125]  Number three.
[02:05:25.405 --> 02:05:28.686]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:28.986 --> 02:05:32.687]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:32.907 --> 02:05:33.467]  Number four.
[02:05:33.687 --> 02:05:36.068]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:36.448 --> 02:05:39.850]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:40.130 --> 02:05:40.670]  Number five.
[02:05:40.930 --> 02:05:44.852]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:45.072 --> 02:05:49.834]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:50.114 --> 02:05:54.155]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:07:08.248 --> 02:07:09.149]  Tyranny is here.
[02:07:09.509 --> 02:07:13.072]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:07:13.372 --> 02:07:15.654]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:07:15.674 --> 02:07:21.118]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:07:21.538 --> 02:07:27.823]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:07:28.203 --> 02:07:33.768]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:07:34.188 --> 02:07:37.891]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:07:38.351 --> 02:07:42.334]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:07:42.634 --> 02:07:48.158]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:07:48.578 --> 02:07:51.540]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:07:52.141 --> 02:07:53.562]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:07:54.122 --> 02:07:54.622]  It's here.

[02:08:06.095 --> 02:08:12.116]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:12.716 --> 02:08:15.777]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.798 --> 02:08:28.200]  Well, it's a great time to have Bob Chapman join us, as he does every Friday, to be able to break down from his decades of research and experience
[02:08:29.338 --> 02:08:35.943]  As a financial advisor and researcher, he's had a great track record of predicting key trends.
[02:08:36.763 --> 02:08:39.225]  With what's unfolding, the dollar is dropping again.
[02:08:39.245 --> 02:08:43.989]  The Chinese have gotten rid of the United States' AAA rating, as well as Europe.
[02:08:44.029 --> 02:08:46.671]  We'll discuss what that means to the layman out there.
[02:08:46.731 --> 02:08:47.571]  People say, well, I don't care.
[02:08:47.591 --> 02:08:48.232]  I don't buy U.S.
[02:08:48.272 --> 02:08:48.572]  bonds.
[02:08:48.612 --> 02:08:48.732]  Well...
[02:08:50.294 --> 02:08:51.555]  This is the stock of the country.
[02:08:52.396 --> 02:08:57.182]  They've passed the Federal Reserve dictatorship takeover in the Senate and the House.
[02:08:57.783 --> 02:08:59.845]  And Goldman Sachs has been slapped on the wrist.
[02:08:59.865 --> 02:09:02.869]  So we'll talk about it all with Bob Chapman.
[02:09:02.889 --> 02:09:03.910]  Bob, good to have you here with us.
[02:09:05.112 --> 02:09:06.613]  Well, thank you very much.
[02:09:06.673 --> 02:09:07.795]  Lots of things going on.
[02:09:08.877 --> 02:09:13.080]  And, uh, I appreciate your comment, uh, Goldman gets slapped in the wrist.
[02:09:13.180 --> 02:09:20.766]  It's, uh, the only country in the world that I know of where you can steal $5 billion, pay a fine of $550 million.
[02:09:21.667 --> 02:09:25.330]  So that means you take about $4.5 billion in profit.
[02:09:25.830 --> 02:09:30.113]  And that just proves crime pays in America.
[02:09:31.474 --> 02:09:37.599]  It's a terrible example for people in college, especially
[02:09:38.160 --> 02:09:41.262]  And in business, uh, to witness such a thing.
[02:09:41.282 --> 02:10:02.898]  You know, four months ago, uh, the firm, uh, that, uh, is run by, uh, Mr. Buffett, uh, Berkshire Hathaway, they admitted that they had cheated the United States government, defrauded them out of $300 million, and they paid a $100 million fine and kept the rest.
[02:10:04.699 --> 02:10:05.920]  And we can hark back to
[02:10:06.778 --> 02:10:24.668]  The late 1980s, when we had that scandal, the Milken scandal, and he stole $3 billion, gave a billion back to the government, and spent maybe 18 months in jail, and lived happily ever after.
[02:10:25.729 --> 02:10:34.454]  And, you know, there's two sets of rules, and there's one for us, and the other set of rules of the Illuminists.
[02:10:35.575 --> 02:10:36.716]  They get away with everything.
[02:10:37.396 --> 02:10:42.778]  And it's really disgraceful and disgusting that they get charged chump change.
[02:10:45.259 --> 02:10:48.601]  Well they do, and of course, hundreds and hundreds of billions were given to
[02:10:50.228 --> 02:10:54.030]  Well, I don't know exactly how they came to that number, but I do know what they do.
[02:11:18.727 --> 02:11:27.074]  And number one, which is one of the worst things that they do, is they'll do placements and underwritings and secondaries.
[02:11:27.914 --> 02:11:32.078]  And as they place the stock or the bonds, they short it.
[02:11:33.419 --> 02:11:36.241]  I mean, here they are convincing people that they should go long.
[02:11:37.202 --> 02:11:45.368]  Bonds in AYABC Company or stock in XYZ Company or a private secondary in
[02:11:48.343 --> 02:11:48.883]  O.M.P.
[02:11:48.923 --> 02:11:54.746]  company and the minute the thing is sold, they're shorting the stock or the bond.
[02:11:55.726 --> 02:11:57.567]  I mean, they make a lot of money doing that.
[02:11:58.608 --> 02:12:09.373]  And this latest fiasco with the dollar where on the USDX, which is an index of six major currencies versus a dollar, it went from having gone down to 74.
[02:12:10.533 --> 02:12:11.814]  It went back up to 89.
[02:12:12.654 --> 02:12:13.955]  Now, what did that happen?
[02:12:14.715 --> 02:12:16.276]  Well, what they did was
[02:12:16.860 --> 02:12:20.583]  They were instrumental in exposing Greece.
[02:12:20.703 --> 02:12:30.310]  Now, everybody knew who was in Europe and in New York, and they knew Greece should have never been accepted into the Eurozone in the first place.
[02:12:30.691 --> 02:12:32.012]  And they had two sets of books.
[02:12:32.492 --> 02:12:33.433]  And how did they know that?
[02:12:34.133 --> 02:12:35.955]  They set the two sets of books up for them.
[02:12:36.675 --> 02:12:39.237]  And they lied about what they had and that they qualified.
[02:12:40.158 --> 02:12:42.900]  And so what they and JPMorgan Chase did
[02:12:43.712 --> 02:12:52.279]  Was that they shorted, bet that the Euro was going to go down, and they bought the dollar long starting last October.
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:13:12.175]  Well, over the last month or six weeks, what they've done is covered their short in the Euro and sold their long position in the dollar and reaped billions of dollars in profit and almost single-handedly destroyed the Eurozone.
[02:13:13.081 --> 02:13:21.003]  Now, the dollar is falling again, because they're out of the market, the manipulation is over, and where's the next stop?
[02:13:21.784 --> 02:13:32.287]  Well, I think it's selling around 82 right now, so we're probably going to get out of the test 74, and it might even break and get down to 71.18, which was the lowest low of all time.
[02:13:34.647 --> 02:13:36.148]  What is that going to mean for gold?
[02:13:38.008 --> 02:13:40.329]  Well, I think, it's my feeling,
[02:13:41.098 --> 02:13:47.121]  That about 14, 15 months ago, gold finally decoupled from the dollar.
[02:13:47.742 --> 02:13:50.723]  And that happened because there's a choice there.
[02:13:51.483 --> 02:13:53.565]  Do you want to be long gold or long the dollar?
[02:13:53.965 --> 02:13:57.987]  The only real currency in the world is gold because it doesn't owe anybody anything.
[02:13:58.927 --> 02:14:04.810]  And I think the realization is out there now that gold is better than the dollar.
[02:14:05.371 --> 02:14:09.533]  And so I think the reflection of what the dollar does
[02:14:10.504 --> 02:14:13.627]  It's only 20% into what gold does.
[02:14:14.468 --> 02:14:21.956]  And when the big players like Goldman and Morgan see and know that the dollar is going to get down...
[02:14:22.662 --> 02:14:24.083]  They deliberately hit gold.
[02:14:24.123 --> 02:14:25.824]  They're the ones who are shorting gold today.
[02:14:26.365 --> 02:14:26.905]  The two of them.
[02:14:27.646 --> 02:14:30.648]  And I'm sure... But every time they push it down, it just pops back up.
[02:14:31.228 --> 02:14:40.535]  Now, what was this Learning Telegraph report of this secret 380 ton, or very close to the entire gold supply for one year, what's mined and refined in one year?
[02:14:41.296 --> 02:14:43.157]  What was going on with that manipulation?
[02:14:44.598 --> 02:14:48.601]  Well, first of all, I think it's fraudulent.
[02:14:49.462 --> 02:14:51.183]  I don't think the event ever happened.
[02:14:52.472 --> 02:14:53.432]  I think they're lying.
[02:14:54.893 --> 02:14:56.293]  Well, you've always talked about that.
[02:14:56.313 --> 02:14:57.473]  You've always talked about that.
[02:14:58.353 --> 02:15:06.074]  You say that what happens there is that they just say it on paper to drive down the price.
[02:15:07.275 --> 02:15:07.795]  Exactly.
[02:15:08.495 --> 02:15:12.956]  And it is possible that they've done that, but there's no reason to do it.
[02:15:13.676 --> 02:15:20.377]  And first they said a commercial bank was involved, and they don't do business with commercial banks, only central banks.
[02:15:22.507 --> 02:15:34.896]  Of course, the question arises, the swapper, was it a central bank or a consortium of central banks, or did a consortium exist at all?
[02:15:35.677 --> 02:15:37.658]  You see, they won't tell you these things.
[02:15:38.639 --> 02:15:42.962]  And because they won't tell you these things, you have to assume that they're lying.
[02:15:43.462 --> 02:15:44.703]  There's no other way to go on it.
[02:15:45.423 --> 02:15:49.166]  It's just like the CPI and the PPI and the employment figures.
[02:15:49.646 --> 02:15:50.147]  They're lies!
[02:15:51.050 --> 02:15:53.211]  And so, you've got to assume that everything else is.
[02:15:53.431 --> 02:15:53.911]  And let's expand.
[02:15:53.931 --> 02:15:55.172]  Well, the BIS is no better.
[02:15:55.812 --> 02:16:00.094]  Bob, I want you to continue on that line, but I want to expand on that in layman terms for people.
[02:16:01.615 --> 02:16:08.138]  If banks can sell each other 380 tons of gold secretly, but the higher level areas of the market
[02:16:09.238 --> 02:16:13.641]  No, it's going on and it's reflected by selling it at a lower price and it's only on paper.
[02:16:14.281 --> 02:16:15.322]  The gold never moves.
[02:16:15.362 --> 02:16:18.744]  That's what Gatta and the congressional hearings have all reported on.
[02:16:19.204 --> 02:16:26.449]  That's how they manipulate it, because it's a paper transaction that they'll just quietly swap back later.
[02:16:26.489 --> 02:16:30.811]  But specifically dealing with secrecy, we have all these congressmen and Senate members
[02:16:31.932 --> 02:16:38.701]  saying we want to know where these trillions went and the Goldman Sachs people and the head of the Federal Reserve
[02:16:39.842 --> 02:16:42.063]  The Treasury head, they'll never say where it goes.
[02:16:42.103 --> 02:16:47.244]  That's an example of this out in the open, incredibly insane secrecy.
[02:16:48.184 --> 02:16:52.506]  And now, Ron Paul concurs with me, so does Napolitano, reading the bill.
[02:16:52.526 --> 02:16:53.446]  I want to get your take on it.
[02:16:53.946 --> 02:17:04.689]  But even the Washington Post admits this new bill they've passed, the financial reform, gives the Federal Reserve massive control over the economy and even less oversight by Congress.
[02:17:04.709 --> 02:17:07.630]  In the words of the Washington Post, almost total autonomy.
[02:17:08.110 --> 02:17:08.770]  So speak to that.
[02:17:10.782 --> 02:17:12.163]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[02:17:12.523 --> 02:17:17.406]  And we've discussed this a long time ago and multiple times in the program.
[02:17:18.086 --> 02:17:32.055]  And they're going to take over the SEC, the CFTC, which is Commodity Futures Trading Corporation, the FDIC, and a new agency, which is for consumer protection.
[02:17:32.615 --> 02:17:36.737]  And they're going to have an oversight board, which they appoint the people.
[02:17:37.638 --> 02:17:39.439]  It's just like me saying, well,
[02:17:39.844 --> 02:17:49.031]  We're going to have a board to oversee talk radio programs, and Alex is going to read it and lead the panel.
[02:17:49.892 --> 02:17:51.353]  It's just silly.
[02:17:51.953 --> 02:17:54.035]  And it's obfuscation.
[02:17:55.336 --> 02:17:57.597]  It's lack of transparency.
[02:17:58.058 --> 02:18:03.842]  They don't want you to know what they're doing, because if the public finds out what they're doing, they'll say, well, how can we allow that?
[02:18:03.942 --> 02:18:04.883]  And they'll try to stop it.
[02:18:05.775 --> 02:18:08.556]  We should be going the other way with the privately-owned Federal Reserve.
[02:18:08.896 --> 02:18:11.356]  We should be getting rid of it, and of course that's what Ron Paul said.
[02:18:11.476 --> 02:18:11.996]  Exactly!
[02:18:12.056 --> 02:18:26.659]  Instead of auditing it, instead of abolishing it, they're like, here, total control over everything in the economy, including individuals' debit cards, that's in the bill, and they agreed not even to look at curbing derivatives until 2022.
[02:18:26.939 --> 02:18:30.260]  That's right, which leaves them
[02:18:31.150 --> 02:18:38.652]  A long time to do their mischief, and they'll come up with something different at that time, if in fact we've got a government at that time.
[02:18:39.172 --> 02:18:43.193]  And these kind of things are what is driving people out of the country.
[02:18:44.373 --> 02:18:44.853]  The U.S.
[02:18:44.893 --> 02:18:55.615]  government, day before yesterday, imposed a $450 charge on people who want to give up their citizenship.
[02:18:56.696 --> 02:18:58.816]  Now, they hadn't had a fee before.
[02:18:59.594 --> 02:19:02.836]  But, obviously, they have a lot of people who are requesting that.
[02:19:03.816 --> 02:19:06.657]  And I don't recommend people do that out of hand.
[02:19:07.438 --> 02:19:18.603]  And if one were to want to do that, you'd have to have a citizenship in another country before you do that because you'd never be able to go anywhere because you wouldn't have a passport.
[02:19:19.263 --> 02:19:20.924]  So, it's something to think about.
[02:19:21.504 --> 02:19:23.245]  But, this is a reflection of that.
[02:19:24.106 --> 02:19:25.666]  And, you know, I get letters all the time.
[02:19:26.107 --> 02:19:27.267]  What state do I go to?
[02:19:27.307 --> 02:19:28.348]  What country do I go to?
[02:19:29.085 --> 02:19:31.028]  How do I get away from this monstrosity?
[02:19:32.090 --> 02:19:33.312]  And quite frankly, you don't.
[02:19:33.352 --> 02:19:33.993]  You've got to fight them.
[02:19:34.834 --> 02:19:35.956]  That's why we're here today.
[02:19:36.016 --> 02:19:36.377]  That's right.
[02:19:36.457 --> 02:19:37.659]  Welcome to the New World Order.
[02:19:37.719 --> 02:19:42.747]  They admit at the OECD and the Ex-Im Bank and the IMF, the World Bank, world government with private...
[02:19:43.812 --> 02:19:46.194]  Madoff type people running everything.
[02:19:46.575 --> 02:19:55.544]  Bernie Madoff, with this legislation passing, is now literally in control of your job, your bank account, your debit card, everything.
[02:19:55.944 --> 02:19:57.886]  You think you've been hurt so far?
[02:19:58.187 --> 02:20:02.271]  They're gonna rape us, and rape us, and rape us, and rape us.
[02:20:06.161 --> 02:20:07.382]  Remain in your houses.
[02:20:08.162 --> 02:20:13.325]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[02:20:13.925 --> 02:20:14.906]  Will they do it?
[02:20:15.286 --> 02:20:17.247]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[02:20:17.908 --> 02:20:23.911]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[02:20:24.371 --> 02:20:25.672]  Think it can't happen here?
[02:20:26.573 --> 02:20:28.614]  Executive Order 10990 locks down all highways.
[02:20:30.835 --> 02:20:35.117]  Executive Order 10995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[02:20:35.718 --> 02:20:39.980]  Executive Order 10998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[02:20:40.620 --> 02:20:45.503]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[02:20:46.363 --> 02:20:54.507]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to martiallawsurvival.com.

[02:22:22.510 --> 02:22:25.412]  We offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.

[02:22:33.977 --> 02:22:35.058]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:35.218 --> 02:22:39.621]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:39.801 --> 02:22:45.505]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:45.605 --> 02:22:49.027]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:49.247 --> 02:22:51.849]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:54.111 --> 02:22:56.872]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:22:57.012 --> 02:22:57.253]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:57.273 --> 02:22:58.674]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:04.217 --> 02:23:06.300]  You worry, but only because you're paying attention.
[02:23:06.760 --> 02:23:09.864]  What's happening in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates an audacity toward nature.
[02:23:10.324 --> 02:23:18.273]  A similar audacity called GMO, or genetically modified organisms, means that the quality of commercially grown food may be compromised with our health in the balance.
[02:23:18.814 --> 02:23:23.718]  Now that summer's here, what better time to learn about the bounty that nature provides in wild edible food.
[02:23:24.279 --> 02:23:29.403]  Let author Linda Runyon show you the best-kept secret in plain sight that food is everywhere you look.
[02:23:29.923 --> 02:23:37.390]  This summer, for the cost of a good meal or two out, you can literally starvation-proof yourself and your loved ones against any future craziness and put up tons of free food too.
[02:23:37.950 --> 02:23:42.954]  Whatever experiment is being run on us, you can rest assured that Linda's 50 or so staple foods aren't involved.
[02:23:43.394 --> 02:23:44.655]  Our foods are their enemy.
[02:23:45.215 --> 02:23:50.700]  So go to ofthefield.com or call toll-free 1-888-51-EAT-FREE and take that first step.
[02:23:51.080 --> 02:23:53.742]  Make your oasis of food security and nutrition now.
[02:23:54.062 --> 02:23:57.324]  That's O-F-T-H-E-F-I-E-L-D dot com or call 1-888-513-2837.
[02:23:57.344 --> 02:23:58.805]  Start now and make 2010 your year of independence.
[02:24:09.451 --> 02:24:11.092]  Bob Chapman's our guest.
[02:24:11.932 --> 02:24:30.442]  Bob, as every week passes, we get a clearer image of exactly what the globalists are doing, and I've come to the realization this week that it is very clear they're going to go for a full collapse, total depression, to try to bankrupt everyone and make people depend on government and consolidate the economy.
[02:24:30.462 --> 02:24:32.564]  But at the same time,
[02:24:33.726 --> 02:24:42.792]  As Brzezinski and others said, people are now going past the puppet politicians and identifying the banking cartel as the source of corruption and oppression.
[02:24:43.272 --> 02:24:44.733]  And so time is running out for them.
[02:24:44.773 --> 02:24:45.874]  How do you see this unfolding?
[02:24:47.054 --> 02:24:52.058]  Well, first of all, you segue into exactly what I wanted to say.
[02:24:52.838 --> 02:25:00.323]  And I was talking with Jim Corbett this morning and I had said, why hasn't Danny Esselstyn come out with more information?
[02:25:01.318 --> 02:25:05.220]  And Jim Tucker as well, regarding the Bilderberg meeting.
[02:25:05.800 --> 02:25:10.082]  And Jim says, well because everybody knows about it, now it's all out in the open.
[02:25:10.782 --> 02:25:13.504]  And I said, well that's because of talk radio and the internet.
[02:25:13.524 --> 02:25:14.584]  And I said, I guess you're right.
[02:25:15.284 --> 02:25:19.606]  So, they're going for it exactly as you say they are.
[02:25:20.167 --> 02:25:21.847]  And they're going for the whole thing.
[02:25:22.247 --> 02:25:27.310]  They want to take everything down so they can force us to accept their world government.
[02:25:27.750 --> 02:25:28.550]  And we've got to stop them.
[02:25:28.590 --> 02:25:29.851]  We've got to inform the people.
[02:25:30.467 --> 02:25:40.277]  We have to do the best we can in November to get rid of the charlatans and crooks out of Congress, and I think we might have some success at that, but it's the truth.
[02:25:40.777 --> 02:25:44.120]  We've got to get more and more people the truth all over the world, and that's what we're doing.
[02:25:45.201 --> 02:25:49.986]  Well, before Bilderberg even started this year, a month and a half ago or so,
[02:25:51.403 --> 02:26:01.989]  I wrote articles with Paul Watson saying, you know, Bilderberg, the open conspiracy, and pointed out that now they say things at Davos that we got in Bilderberg documents from 50 years ago that they've released.
[02:26:02.549 --> 02:26:05.331]  Now they say things in the Financial Times of London that was secret.
[02:26:05.651 --> 02:26:06.932]  They admit world government.
[02:26:06.972 --> 02:26:08.973]  They admit they want an authoritarian system.
[02:26:09.493 --> 02:26:13.256]  They admit all of this because they tried to deny it, deny it as long as they could.
[02:26:14.036 --> 02:26:14.356]  That's right.
[02:26:14.376 --> 02:26:15.656]  And that gives them exposure only one way.
[02:26:15.676 --> 02:26:20.837]  And that's what leads me to believe that they're going to turn the episode in Europe, the five-week countries,
[02:26:42.040 --> 02:26:44.442]  Which can't pay their bills and can't pay the debt back.
[02:26:45.463 --> 02:26:50.848]  I think they're going to allow, again, decentralization in Europe.
[02:26:51.628 --> 02:27:09.564]  And the reason I say that is that Germany, the German people, who never wanted to be in the EU, did not want to be in the Euro, and they still don't, are discussing the possibility of writing off two-thirds to one-half
[02:27:10.316 --> 02:27:12.877]  Of all the debt of the five nations that are in trouble.
[02:27:13.737 --> 02:27:15.137]  Euphemistically called pigs.
[02:27:15.717 --> 02:27:16.777]  And I despise that.
[02:27:16.817 --> 02:27:19.118]  I don't think they should use such a term.
[02:27:19.538 --> 02:27:21.078]  No matter what you think of the countries.
[02:27:21.978 --> 02:27:24.819]  And there's a lot of people who live in those countries that don't deserve that.
[02:27:25.499 --> 02:27:30.400]  But that's the way Germany is pointing in this direction at that time.
[02:27:30.840 --> 02:27:33.701]  And that will lead to a breakup of the euro.
[02:27:33.721 --> 02:27:38.522]  And force the elitists to go to the SDR.
[02:27:39.745 --> 02:27:41.006]  Uh, special drawing right?
[02:27:41.706 --> 02:27:52.410]  And if there's a good chance it could break up the European Union in that form of decentralization and that would be ultimately good for them if they get caught and can't get out of it.
[02:27:52.950 --> 02:27:56.732]  The other way they can do it is by having a war and say, Hey, we didn't do this.
[02:27:57.112 --> 02:27:57.732]  The war did it.
[02:27:57.752 --> 02:27:59.653]  I mean, that wasn't in our attention.
[02:28:00.313 --> 02:28:02.674]  And so I think that's what's coming down the pike.
[02:28:02.694 --> 02:28:05.255]  Uh, and I think the first one
[02:28:06.737 --> 02:28:23.324]  After the euro collapses, which I think it will, I think the next event will be pressure on the EU by the UK, which I think will withdraw and put on tariffs on goods and services.
[02:28:24.004 --> 02:28:25.165]  And the US will follow.
[02:28:25.585 --> 02:28:33.508]  And that should break up the EU and a lot of the treaty agreements between nations regarding free trade and globalization.
[02:28:34.650 --> 02:28:36.090]  You're absolutely right, Bob.
[02:28:37.611 --> 02:28:42.593]  How do you see them trying to actually implement this Federal Reserve takeover?
[02:28:42.633 --> 02:28:49.175]  Because I've got reports here from ABC News, Senator Shelby and others say financial reform will be repealed.
[02:28:51.276 --> 02:28:55.517]  Well, I hope they're right, but in order to do that, we have to help them.
[02:28:55.957 --> 02:28:56.998]  And how do we help them?
[02:28:57.778 --> 02:29:04.060]  We make sure that we get rid of lots of incumbents who are on the payroll,
[02:29:04.685 --> 02:29:10.728]  Of Wall Street, banking, insurance, pharmaceutical companies, and transnational conglomerates.
[02:29:11.308 --> 02:29:13.349]  And if we can do that, we get a shot at it.
[02:29:13.970 --> 02:29:21.714]  Now, Bob, to throw this out as we go to break, I get emails, calls, and see comments on our site saying, Alex, why are you against financial reform?
[02:29:21.734 --> 02:29:22.614]  Let's get the bankers.
[02:29:22.974 --> 02:29:24.495]  The bankers run the Congress.
[02:29:24.775 --> 02:29:26.036]  This is giving them more power.
[02:29:26.076 --> 02:29:31.879]  This financial reform is like saying, oh, a demon possessed somebody, so let's possess them with Satan.
[02:29:32.319 --> 02:29:34.100]  I mean, it's so elementary.
[02:29:35.931 --> 02:29:36.431]  And you're right.
[02:29:36.932 --> 02:29:38.232]  And people just don't understand.
[02:29:38.312 --> 02:29:44.076]  Even people who have business degrees and even masters in business, they don't know what we're talking about.
[02:29:44.096 --> 02:29:48.358]  They will if we talk about it long enough and make them understand in simple terms.
[02:29:48.578 --> 02:29:48.899]  Yep.
[02:29:48.919 --> 02:29:49.479]  Stay there, Bob.
[02:29:49.519 --> 02:29:51.540]  We're gonna come right back with you and some phone calls.
[02:29:51.560 --> 02:29:52.761]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:29:54.642 --> 02:29:55.562]  We're on the march.
[02:29:56.043 --> 02:29:57.644]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:57.664 --> 02:30:01.266]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:05.851 --> 02:30:09.474]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:09.814 --> 02:30:17.940]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:30:18.681 --> 02:30:22.704]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:30:23.304 --> 02:30:34.133]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:30:34.753 --> 02:30:43.755]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:44.255 --> 02:30:49.296]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[02:32:03.612 --> 02:32:07.855]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:08.175 --> 02:32:08.775]  Number 1.
[02:32:09.075 --> 02:32:12.237]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:12.498 --> 02:32:13.078]  Number 2.
[02:32:13.378 --> 02:32:17.921]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:18.261 --> 02:32:18.702]  It's true.
[02:32:19.002 --> 02:32:23.565]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:23.885 --> 02:32:24.405]  Number 3.
[02:32:24.705 --> 02:32:27.987]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:28.288 --> 02:32:31.990]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:32.190 --> 02:32:32.731]  Number 4.
[02:32:32.991 --> 02:32:35.354]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:35.754 --> 02:32:39.138]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:39.438 --> 02:32:39.638]  Number 5.
[02:32:40.219 --> 02:32:44.143]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:44.364 --> 02:32:49.129]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:49.409 --> 02:32:53.434]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:53.574 --> 02:32:55.156]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:33:07.745 --> 02:33:08.446]  Big Brother.
[02:33:08.727 --> 02:33:09.989]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:10.410 --> 02:33:11.552]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:11.792 --> 02:33:12.774]  You want answers?
[02:33:13.054 --> 02:33:14.136]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:15.138 --> 02:33:19.044]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:34.516 --> 02:33:39.280]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, on this Friday, July 16, 2010 edition.
[02:33:39.420 --> 02:33:44.685]  We're going right back to Bob Chapman and some of your phone calls here in just a moment.
[02:33:44.765 --> 02:33:52.472]  And towards the end of the hour, I'm going to hit some final eugenics news here that is so important for everyone out there to understand.
[02:33:54.889 --> 02:33:59.315]  But I wanted to put on screen one version of my film, The Obama Deception.
[02:33:59.355 --> 02:34:00.116]  It's free on YouTube.
[02:34:00.136 --> 02:34:05.304]  You can buy the high-quality DVD at Infowars.com and have it in the highest quality with the extras and supporters.
[02:34:05.644 --> 02:34:06.525]  We appreciate that.
[02:34:07.186 --> 02:34:08.688]  But we want to get this out to the public.
[02:34:09.802 --> 02:34:20.048]  And we are having listeners today try to... I mean, BP is not even in the top ten on Google and Yahoo trends.
[02:34:20.868 --> 02:34:23.570]  Millions of people every day go to the front pages of these sites.
[02:34:24.230 --> 02:34:25.851]  They look at what the top stories are.
[02:34:26.171 --> 02:34:27.532]  You're able to drive it to the top.
[02:34:28.012 --> 02:34:33.315]  If you put the term, the Obama deception, the Obama deception,
[02:34:35.029 --> 02:34:37.872]  Just go into Google and type the Obama deception in.
[02:34:38.152 --> 02:34:38.572]  Hit enter.
[02:34:38.592 --> 02:34:39.473]  It'll bring up the results.
[02:34:39.573 --> 02:34:40.314]  Back out again.
[02:34:41.255 --> 02:34:42.276]  Put your cursor on it.
[02:34:42.756 --> 02:34:46.720]  Click it so it's a new search and just keep re-entering it at least 15 times.
[02:34:46.740 --> 02:34:47.701]  It'll take you a couple minutes.
[02:34:47.721 --> 02:34:49.582]  You don't have to type it in each time.
[02:34:49.762 --> 02:34:51.984]  After you type it in, you hit search.
[02:34:52.978 --> 02:35:01.866]  Then you put your cursor in there, click it so it thinks it's a new search, or change one letter, you know, erase the end, put an end back on it, but it's easier just to... That guy, show him!
[02:35:02.427 --> 02:35:02.707]  Show him!
[02:35:02.747 --> 02:35:07.151]  I mean, most listeners know this, but if you go to YouTube or Google, and look at the comments there.
[02:35:07.171 --> 02:35:10.914]  It says, search the Obama deception on Yahoo or Google now.
[02:35:11.415 --> 02:35:12.596]  Infowarriors unite.
[02:35:12.896 --> 02:35:15.478]  So our great listeners are in there on that particular video.
[02:35:16.039 --> 02:35:18.901]  That's just the individual video with the most views, six and a half million.
[02:35:19.987 --> 02:35:28.194]  It's well over 25 million altogether and they're in there promoting search the Obama Deception on YouTube and Google and Yahoo.
[02:35:29.335 --> 02:35:47.009]  And so all you do is you go to Google and you type the Obama Deception in the search box, you hit enter, and then after it loads you just put your cursor in the middle of the Obama Deception text and click it so that it knows it's a new search and then it still says the Obama Deception, re-enter it.
[02:35:48.243 --> 02:35:50.785]  You can do that hundreds of times, it'll guaranteed go to the top.
[02:35:52.086 --> 02:36:02.512]  Now listen, many times I have had my videos already number one on the web, and be the top search, and it gets millions of new people to see them.
[02:36:03.013 --> 02:36:07.796]  We're just artificially doing this here today, so there's not Lindsay Lohan and Mel Gibson.
[02:36:08.096 --> 02:36:11.338]  I mean, the BP oil spill isn't even in the top ten, that should be number one.
[02:36:13.510 --> 02:36:18.513]  This is culture jamming, and you can also do it on Twitter and Facebook, and people are doing it, and I want to commend you.
[02:36:19.113 --> 02:36:23.656]  Sunday, four to six, I'll be able to come back and report to you with screenshots of how well we did.
[02:36:23.676 --> 02:36:25.857]  We're going back to Bob here in just a moment.
[02:36:25.917 --> 02:36:29.359]  His website, of course, is theinternationalforecaster.com.
[02:36:29.379 --> 02:36:35.382]  We'll give you a toll-free number where you can get a free trial subscription before he leaves us, so make sure you have that number, Bob.
[02:36:36.083 --> 02:36:38.104]  Always springing on him in the last minute.
[02:36:38.324 --> 02:36:39.985]  But I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors here.
[02:36:40.065 --> 02:36:41.286]  One of them is Pure Water Freedom.
[02:36:41.846 --> 02:36:44.468]  Your municipal water supplies have poison dumped in them.
[02:36:44.528 --> 02:36:45.729]  Fluoride, mercury, lead.
[02:36:45.749 --> 02:36:46.709]  Go research it for yourself.
[02:36:47.330 --> 02:36:49.431]  I want to tell you about purewaterfreedom.com.
[02:36:49.471 --> 02:36:51.372]  That's one word, purewaterfreedom.com.
[02:36:51.693 --> 02:36:55.015]  You want to affordably remove fluoride from your tap water, your shower, your bath.
[02:36:55.035 --> 02:36:55.935]  They've got a whole house.
[02:36:56.276 --> 02:36:57.557]  They've got basic water filters.
[02:36:57.577 --> 02:37:02.300]  They've got a giant line of high-quality, made in America, made in the United States.
[02:37:02.720 --> 02:37:06.583]  Purewaterfreedom.com, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:37:25.260 --> 02:37:27.302]  Special diets, efoodsdirect.com.
[02:37:27.322 --> 02:37:32.005]  With all this craziness, you need to be self-sufficient if society goes into a depression.
[02:37:32.025 --> 02:37:35.108]  And unfortunately, we're in one, and it's only going to get worse because the globals are running things.
[02:37:35.368 --> 02:37:36.208]  We've tried to stop it.
[02:37:36.869 --> 02:37:39.491]  efoodsdirect.com, the letter E, foodsdirect.com.
[02:37:39.511 --> 02:37:40.191]  We're giving them a call.
[02:37:40.451 --> 02:37:41.272]  Get a free brochure.
[02:37:41.332 --> 02:37:41.973]  Information, 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633.
[02:37:45.515 --> 02:37:47.176]  No, I think we've covered some of the highlights.
[02:37:47.196 --> 02:37:49.376]  Things that are in the news, things that are coming.
[02:38:08.706 --> 02:38:09.666]  No, we got it good.
[02:38:09.726 --> 02:38:11.427]  Let's bring on the callers.
[02:38:11.487 --> 02:38:12.607]  They are our bread and butter.
[02:38:12.787 --> 02:38:14.408]  Alright, Kyle in Missouri.
[02:38:14.428 --> 02:38:15.068]  You're on the air.
[02:38:15.128 --> 02:38:15.568]  Go ahead.
[02:38:16.949 --> 02:38:17.449]  Hey, Alex.
[02:38:17.469 --> 02:38:17.909]  How you doing?
[02:38:18.029 --> 02:38:18.389]  Good, sir.
[02:38:19.649 --> 02:38:28.152]  I was just listening to your show this afternoon and I noticed that you're asking everybody to do some searches on search engines and Facebook, Twitter, stuff like that.
[02:38:29.913 --> 02:38:37.735]  For those people who sit down at the computer five or six times a day just to check their stuff and then they get up and leave, they're probably not going to think about
[02:38:38.294 --> 02:38:43.637]  Yeah, like Google will ask you, hey, do you want us to give you updates on this term?
[02:38:43.677 --> 02:38:49.040]  Yeah, that and like extensions, like just for example, Google has one and I use it for this exact purpose.
[02:39:08.072 --> 02:39:12.254]  And I've read about this, that the mainstream media has these to push Lindsay Lohan and stuff.
[02:39:12.294 --> 02:39:15.235]  The media's already doing this themselves.
[02:39:32.944 --> 02:39:33.304]  Correct.
[02:39:33.464 --> 02:39:41.770]  So this is a tool that Infowarriors and Patriots who just leave their computers on, that they can install on their browsers that will help.
[02:39:41.890 --> 02:39:47.114]  Do me a favor, send me a list of those and I'm going to send it to Watson and ask him to do a blurb or I'll have Matt Ryan do it.
[02:39:47.134 --> 02:39:49.055]  Aaron's busy with filmmaking with me today.
[02:39:49.696 --> 02:39:55.940]  But we need to get that done and have an article about this and have the add-ons there so people know what's going on.
[02:39:55.980 --> 02:39:57.221]  Bob, what's your take on this?
[02:39:58.542 --> 02:39:59.743]  I think it's a great idea.
[02:40:00.616 --> 02:40:04.258]  And as you say, others are doing it, so why shouldn't we do it?
[02:40:04.298 --> 02:40:05.018]  So let's do it.
[02:40:05.699 --> 02:40:12.022]  And let's put that particular DVD right in the front of people so they can see what's really going on.
[02:40:12.382 --> 02:40:13.443]  The Obama deception.
[02:40:13.463 --> 02:40:14.363]  Kyle, God bless you.
[02:40:14.403 --> 02:40:16.004]  Tom in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:40:17.505 --> 02:40:18.565]  Hi, Bob and Alex.
[02:40:19.446 --> 02:40:19.666]  Hello.
[02:40:21.080 --> 02:40:33.991]  Hey, listen, now real quick, Bob, do you see in the next six to nine months a breakdown, a bankrupting of the local municipalities where the police departments and stuff can't run?
[02:40:34.011 --> 02:40:35.732]  That was a question I meant to ask Bob.
[02:40:35.752 --> 02:40:37.033]  Stay there because I want to throw that out.
[02:40:37.193 --> 02:40:48.600]  I mean, it's already happening in Ohio, in Michigan, in Florida, in California, where they say we're not going to pave the streets in LA, the sidewalks, we're going to lay off a bunch of cops and they won't respond to burglary and robbery.
[02:40:48.640 --> 02:40:49.781]  I mean, this is really happening.
[02:40:50.001 --> 02:40:51.302]  So I don't see it happening.
[02:40:51.702 --> 02:40:52.602]  It's already happening.
[02:40:52.642 --> 02:40:57.445]  And Gerald Salente's prediction of total collapse by December, unfortunately, it looks like it may happen.
[02:40:57.465 --> 02:40:58.046]  Bob Chapman?
[02:40:59.887 --> 02:41:00.487]  Possible.
[02:41:00.627 --> 02:41:01.848]  I don't think it's probable.
[02:41:02.435 --> 02:41:09.257]  And one of the reasons why is people are going to have to be pushed to the very edge because people are not lawbreakers in America.
[02:41:09.297 --> 02:41:12.178]  Yes, we have criminals, but every society has criminals.
[02:41:12.198 --> 02:41:15.739]  But it's almost like these police chiefs saying, we're not going to stop crime.
[02:41:15.859 --> 02:41:17.520]  They're trying to encourage a collapse.
[02:41:19.440 --> 02:41:24.102]  No, I just think they want to keep their jobs and they want to do a good job, generally speaking.
[02:41:24.842 --> 02:41:26.522]  And it's great disappointment.
[02:41:26.723 --> 02:41:28.043]  And I can understand that.
[02:41:29.072 --> 02:41:33.953]  Uh, you know, and I think they should think in terms of, well, it's not going to be forever either.
[02:41:34.593 --> 02:41:40.915]  I mean, if they, if the state or the city or the county can raise enough money, they can hire policemen back again.
[02:41:41.015 --> 02:41:42.455]  Well, then Bob, give us your timeline.
[02:41:42.475 --> 02:41:44.055]  I mean, how bad is this depression going to get?
[02:41:44.095 --> 02:41:45.015]  We are in a depression.
[02:41:45.035 --> 02:41:45.496]  Do you agree?
[02:41:46.556 --> 02:41:46.836]  Yes.
[02:41:47.156 --> 02:41:48.956]  And we started a year ago, February.
[02:41:48.976 --> 02:41:54.177]  Uh, I think that the Fed is going to go to, uh, creating money and credit.
[02:41:54.577 --> 02:41:55.698]  Uh, how long will that last?
[02:41:55.918 --> 02:41:57.018]  Probably two years.
[02:41:57.925 --> 02:41:58.666]  What will that do?
[02:41:59.066 --> 02:42:11.556]  It'll lift the economy exactly as you saw in the last five quarters where we gained about three and a half percent plus on GDP because two and a half trillion dollars was injected.
[02:42:11.596 --> 02:42:12.918]  Well, we know that's numbers.
[02:42:12.958 --> 02:42:16.981]  They claim unemployment's 9.4 and all the experts say it's over 22.
[02:42:18.282 --> 02:42:19.163]  Well, that's true.
[02:42:19.763 --> 02:42:21.785]  The only thing is they're going to try
[02:42:22.816 --> 02:42:26.377]  To skate this thing through until after the next election.
[02:42:26.937 --> 02:42:28.498]  Not this one, but the following one.
[02:42:29.158 --> 02:42:30.919]  And that's what I think they're going to do to do it.
[02:42:30.999 --> 02:42:42.123]  And that'll be accompanied by higher inflation, and it'll probably knock unemployment back a point or two, from 22.2 to perhaps 20.2, but it's not going to be substantial.
[02:42:46.624 --> 02:42:47.744]  And that's what they'll get out of it.
[02:42:47.764 --> 02:42:50.365]  We should get 14% inflation easy.
[02:42:50.445 --> 02:42:51.806]  It might be much higher than that.
[02:42:51.826 --> 02:42:52.766]  So you're saying inflation?
[02:42:52.826 --> 02:42:53.366]  I don't know.
[02:42:53.927 --> 02:42:54.687]  Tom, anything else?
[02:42:55.547 --> 02:42:56.207]  Yes, Alex.
[02:42:56.287 --> 02:43:06.971]  I just wanted to let you know, here in San Antonio yesterday, we had a much older plainclothes police officer from the city of San Antonio in here with two Kosovo nationals.
[02:43:07.371 --> 02:43:09.952]  And one of our employees asked him, today, where are you guys from?
[02:43:10.272 --> 02:43:11.673]  And he said, we're from Kosovo.
[02:43:12.293 --> 02:43:17.896]  And of course that alarmed me, and I, you know, look at, uh, there's, uh, Police International.
[02:43:18.056 --> 02:43:21.617]  You take a look at that company, and this guy looked like a storm trooper.
[02:43:21.838 --> 02:43:26.740]  They were in a plainclothes car, and he let her out of the back door, and it was very suspicious.
[02:43:26.820 --> 02:43:33.163]  I mean, so, what do we have, uh, city, uh, you know, of San Antonio Police doing running around with Kosovo Nationals and police cars?
[02:43:33.763 --> 02:43:35.165]  I'm really shocked that Bob's a prognostication.
[02:43:51.123 --> 02:44:11.931]  I read that the Europeans were predicting that the euro would be up to $1.50 by December, a basis that China was striving for a basket of currencies, and number two, China is very enraged about these English-American rating agencies that wanted to form their own.
[02:44:12.271 --> 02:44:13.312]  What's your opinion, Bob?
[02:44:13.352 --> 02:44:16.793]  Yeah, how does that tie into the AAA rating being lost for Europe and the U.S.? ?
[02:44:18.700 --> 02:44:21.022]  Well, China is doing what's proper.
[02:44:21.822 --> 02:44:23.524]  They're right in their assessment.
[02:44:24.404 --> 02:44:28.667]  And you talk about another currency, it's the SDR.
[02:44:29.308 --> 02:44:35.752]  The Chinese have been giving the IMF dollars and getting SDRs in return.
[02:44:36.273 --> 02:44:38.895]  So they're behind that movement, they're not against it.
[02:44:39.535 --> 02:44:41.817]  And if you look at today's figures that just came out,
[02:44:42.318 --> 02:44:48.641]  You'll see that during the month of May, China was a large seller of dollar-denominated assets.
[02:44:49.421 --> 02:44:53.283]  And so, they're exiting the dollar, as other countries are.
[02:44:53.543 --> 02:44:57.305]  That was actually in CNBC today, that they're, for the first time, moving out of the dollar.
[02:44:58.045 --> 02:44:59.986]  They're not purchasing a lot of T-bills.
[02:45:01.347 --> 02:45:02.287]  Yeah, that's visible.
[02:45:03.428 --> 02:45:06.249]  And they've done some of that before, which wasn't as visible.
[02:45:07.109 --> 02:45:10.471]  And so, normally, a year and a half ago,
[02:45:11.713 --> 02:45:17.237]  64.5% of the foreign exchange of foreign nations was in U.S.
[02:45:17.297 --> 02:45:17.717]  dollars.
[02:45:18.117 --> 02:45:20.979]  That figure is around 59.5% right now.
[02:45:21.640 --> 02:45:22.940]  So there's dumping going on.
[02:45:23.681 --> 02:45:27.283]  And of course, it's going to be expedited by the fall in the dollar.
[02:45:27.303 --> 02:45:39.791]  And incidentally, in that fall of the dollar, which we just experienced and it's in motion, not only the Chinese were sellers, but other central banks as well were sellers.
[02:45:40.729 --> 02:45:43.270]  And so, all he did was get a second chance.
[02:45:43.330 --> 02:45:45.651]  Well, our industrial base has collapsed.
[02:45:45.771 --> 02:45:47.192]  Our industrial base has collapsed.
[02:45:47.832 --> 02:45:48.813]  Our credit is collapsing.
[02:45:48.853 --> 02:45:49.873]  Our dollar is collapsing.
[02:45:49.913 --> 02:45:52.374]  I mean, we're already in a collapse.
[02:45:52.414 --> 02:45:53.375]  Collapse is imminent.
[02:45:53.395 --> 02:45:54.915]  The question is how deep will it go?
[02:45:55.116 --> 02:45:56.056]  Thanks for the call, Joe.
[02:45:56.096 --> 02:45:57.777]  Real fast, Bob, how deep will it go?
[02:45:58.817 --> 02:46:00.858]  Extremely deep, over a period of time.
[02:46:01.498 --> 02:46:03.279]  And, you know, I don't like to pick dates.
[02:46:03.359 --> 02:46:05.120]  It's very, very, very hard.
[02:46:05.920 --> 02:46:09.102]  I mean, I picked recently the circumstances
[02:46:10.098 --> 02:46:18.684]  Of default and a new currency, the SDR, and revaluation and devaluation.
[02:46:19.305 --> 02:46:23.708]  But trying to put a time frame on it is extremely difficult because things change so fast.
[02:46:23.728 --> 02:46:28.311]  So the same thing is true about insurrection in America or any other country.
[02:46:28.811 --> 02:46:30.312]  It's there, it's latent.
[02:46:31.493 --> 02:46:36.477]  We don't have the, we may not have the local police forces
[02:46:37.308 --> 02:46:42.114]  To keep order, and that will expedite craziness.
[02:46:53.257 --> 02:46:55.860]  And can pick by December and he may well be right.
[02:46:56.301 --> 02:46:57.042]  I just don't know.
[02:46:57.062 --> 02:46:57.622]  Oh, I hope he's wrong.
[02:46:57.642 --> 02:46:59.384]  I just know it's bad and we're gonna get there.
[02:46:59.605 --> 02:47:01.967]  I hope he's wrong, but he's a smart guy.
[02:47:01.987 --> 02:47:03.489]  That's why we have him on.
[02:47:04.290 --> 02:47:07.494]  Let's go ahead and talk to Duff in Kansas.
[02:47:07.514 --> 02:47:08.195]  You're on the air, Duff.
[02:47:09.448 --> 02:47:09.968]  Hi, Alex.
[02:47:09.988 --> 02:47:10.528]  Hi, Bob.
[02:47:11.589 --> 02:47:11.669]  Hey.
[02:47:11.749 --> 02:47:13.310]  Just a couple of things real quick.
[02:47:13.330 --> 02:47:18.151]  You know, listening to you guys, I listen to your program daily.
[02:47:18.231 --> 02:47:21.253]  I'm a Prison Planet TV subscriber.
[02:47:21.473 --> 02:47:21.753]  Thank you.
[02:47:21.793 --> 02:47:24.674]  And listening to you guys, I've done a lot of things different.
[02:47:25.975 --> 02:47:32.877]  And one real good example that goes out to your listeners, our company, which is a real small company, changed our IRAs.
[02:47:34.318 --> 02:47:36.199]  And we got the pamphlets last night.
[02:47:36.239 --> 02:47:36.639]  I went on
[02:47:37.864 --> 02:47:48.608]  Went on the internet and was looking at their pamphlet comparing it to the S&P 500, which are new retirements connected to, and started doing my research.
[02:47:48.648 --> 02:47:52.230]  Their graphs didn't match what the stock market's graphs showed.
[02:47:52.310 --> 02:47:57.012]  Their graphs were completely, oh, I don't know, wrong.
[02:47:57.752 --> 02:48:06.916]  But the first story I came across on my iPhone connected to the S&P 500 was the collapse of middle class society.
[02:48:08.345 --> 02:48:13.307]  You know, so I do things completely different today as a result of listening to your program.
[02:48:14.488 --> 02:48:20.251]  And the other point that I wanted to make is the way I watch the news is also different.
[02:48:20.811 --> 02:48:26.393]  You know, I don't watch mainstream, but one of my favorite news channels I do watch is RT.
[02:48:27.434 --> 02:48:35.918]  And one of the most amazing things that they reported on last night was that Russia and Germany were having talks together
[02:48:36.944 --> 02:48:38.639]  About using food as a weapon.
[02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:41.240]  Wow, I'm going to have to look into that.
[02:48:41.260 --> 02:48:45.742]  I'm on RT today, coming up in about an hour and 15 minutes from now.
[02:48:46.303 --> 02:48:47.643]  I'm scheduled to be on there live.
[02:48:48.743 --> 02:48:53.185]  I appreciate your call, but that was another question I had for Bob, and the callers are reminding me of questions I had.
[02:48:54.086 --> 02:48:58.287]  We have companies creating subsidiaries, bankrupting the old one to steal pensions.
[02:48:58.327 --> 02:48:59.748]  We have companies reducing pensions.
[02:48:59.788 --> 02:49:04.970]  We have an acceleration of the government, quote, ordering private pension funds to invest in failed banks.
[02:49:04.990 --> 02:49:06.551]  That's Bloomberg and Reuters.
[02:49:07.511 --> 02:49:09.252]  And so we are seeing an acceleration
[02:49:10.212 --> 02:49:12.113]  Of the system going after the pension funds.
[02:49:12.173 --> 02:49:13.053]  Bob, your take on that?
[02:49:14.534 --> 02:49:15.254]  Well, it's coming.
[02:49:15.834 --> 02:49:17.114]  And I don't know when.
[02:49:18.415 --> 02:49:20.976]  I know they're not going to tackle it before the next election.
[02:49:22.856 --> 02:49:25.217]  If they do, it'll be after that time.
[02:49:25.957 --> 02:49:33.560]  And if there's major changes, I think they might have to put it off for some time, although I see
[02:49:34.255 --> 02:49:44.518]  In the President's administration, things being brought forward, which is suicidal, and that would be suicidal as well, under the terrible unemployment and debt circumstances.
[02:49:45.358 --> 02:49:56.301]  And you just look at this immigration situation with Arizona, 90%, 94% to survey say the people agree with Arizona, and yet the President's pushing it.
[02:49:56.341 --> 02:49:57.181]  Why is he pushing it?
[02:49:57.581 --> 02:49:59.862]  Because his handlers are telling him that's what you're going to do.
[02:50:00.362 --> 02:50:01.302]  Well, he has a mission.
[02:50:01.362 --> 02:50:02.963]  People keep saying, why is Obama doing this?
[02:50:03.043 --> 02:50:03.803]  It's destroying him.
[02:50:04.203 --> 02:50:05.003]  He's a puppet.
[02:50:05.363 --> 02:50:06.464]  He's birdcage liner.
[02:50:06.504 --> 02:50:07.424]  He's a trash bag.
[02:50:07.464 --> 02:50:09.284]  They'll throw him out whenever they want.
[02:50:09.785 --> 02:50:13.166]  God forbid they assassinate him, but many are saying impeachment or embalmment.
[02:50:13.846 --> 02:50:15.726]  And, you know, he's got a job to do.
[02:50:15.766 --> 02:50:17.747]  Bob, it's always great having you on.
[02:50:17.787 --> 02:50:19.367]  God willing, you'll be on with us next Friday.
[02:50:20.047 --> 02:50:25.289]  But, Bob, tell folks how they can call and get a free introductory copy of the International Forecaster.
[02:50:26.629 --> 02:50:27.189]  They can go to 877-479-8000.
[02:50:30.494 --> 02:50:34.376]  8178, that's toll free.
[02:50:34.396 --> 02:50:34.877]  877-479-8178.
[02:50:35.757 --> 02:50:45.442]  You can get a copy, a hard copy, or an email copy, or you can get a free one-year subscription by getting a small gold coin.
[02:50:46.122 --> 02:50:47.743]  Yeah, the fifth of an ounce, Frank, great deal.

[02:52:13.918 --> 02:52:16.159]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:52:16.319 --> 02:52:21.601]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.

[02:54:10.565 --> 02:54:12.206]  I'm going to cover this in more detail.
[02:54:12.226 --> 02:54:15.949]  We're going to produce a special video this weekend for viral release.
[02:54:16.590 --> 02:54:17.771]  It'll be out by tomorrow.
[02:54:17.791 --> 02:54:23.715]  It's going to deal with eugenics where I'm going to show you a bunch of food and their labels and the different poisons that are in them.
[02:54:24.116 --> 02:54:28.639]  But a key study that Aaron Dykes found, Rockefeller study, envisions food
[02:54:29.870 --> 02:54:32.433]  A future dictatorship controlled by the elite.
[02:54:32.553 --> 02:54:42.785]  And it gets into controlling food, to the environment, total control, martial law, millions dead, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, biometric IDs, to travel, to live.
[02:54:43.566 --> 02:54:45.488]  Read what these monsters are planning for you.
[02:54:45.989 --> 02:54:47.931]  And it's the same thing in hundreds.
[02:54:48.792 --> 02:54:49.273]  I think so.
[02:55:02.366 --> 02:55:04.688]  And of course, the previous Chief Aide to Senator Inhofe.
[02:55:05.148 --> 02:55:06.549]  The point is, he's pretty mainstream.
[02:55:07.009 --> 02:55:15.775]  And he's now just quoting what's in the writings of Paul Ehrlich, who also co-wrote this with the White House science czar, with John P. Holdren, eco-science.
[02:55:16.655 --> 02:55:18.577]  So, again, that's starting to hit the news.
[02:55:18.977 --> 02:55:21.038]  Of course, we covered all these news headlines constantly.
[02:55:21.078 --> 02:55:23.260]  Sterilize the poor and bring back the workhouse.
[02:55:24.941 --> 02:55:25.901]  Here's the Wall Street Journal.
[02:55:25.921 --> 02:55:27.543]  Would recession be good for the environment?
[02:55:27.603 --> 02:55:29.384]  Lowering your carbon
[02:55:30.660 --> 02:55:31.120]  We're good.
[02:55:52.329 --> 02:55:53.950]  Of course, that's the globalist competition, though.
[02:55:53.970 --> 02:55:55.650]  They don't want any competition.
[02:55:55.690 --> 02:55:58.852]  They want anybody who can even read to be dead, like Pol Pot.
[02:55:59.632 --> 02:56:00.672]  There's another one.
[02:56:01.052 --> 02:56:01.212]  U.S.
[02:56:01.252 --> 02:56:02.913]  taxpayers have subsidized a new U.N.
[02:56:02.953 --> 02:56:04.734]  agency promoting abortion.
[02:56:04.794 --> 02:56:05.654]  CNS News.
[02:56:06.515 --> 02:56:08.335]  And I want to go over some fluoride dangers.
[02:56:08.815 --> 02:56:11.656]  Environmental Group slams food fluoride levels.
[02:56:12.917 --> 02:56:14.818]  900 parts per million in
[02:56:16.138 --> 02:56:16.939]  Powdered eggs.
[02:56:17.579 --> 02:56:21.201]  I mean, one part per million doubles bone cancer, brain damage.
[02:56:21.221 --> 02:56:23.023]  Imagine 900 parts per million.
[02:56:23.723 --> 02:56:30.628]  And they just go through what the FDA allows to be put in hundreds of foods that you're not being told about.
[02:56:31.028 --> 02:56:39.093]  And they spray it on the crops as a pesticide because it kills bugs and then it leaches in and precipitates and concentrates within the food crops.
[02:56:41.194 --> 02:56:41.735]  Here's another one.
[02:56:41.755 --> 02:56:44.797]  Environmental group petitions EPA to restrict fluoride pesticides.
[02:56:48.237 --> 02:56:49.377]  It just goes on and on.
[02:56:49.417 --> 02:56:50.979]  I just want to warn people about this.
[02:56:51.799 --> 02:56:55.061]  Excess fluoride taints water at Anchorage military base.
[02:56:56.182 --> 02:56:58.664]  High levels can lead to stomach ailments and even death.
[02:56:59.044 --> 02:57:00.245]  That's the Anchorage Daily News.
[02:57:00.285 --> 02:57:01.426]  I mean, this is what's going on.
[02:57:01.766 --> 02:57:03.187]  They put this in your water, folks.
[02:57:03.207 --> 02:57:04.167]  This is so sick.
[02:57:04.428 --> 02:57:05.628]  They're doing it on purpose.
[02:57:06.509 --> 02:57:08.050]  It's in the Ehrlich books.
[02:57:08.190 --> 02:57:09.591]  It's in the Holdren books.
[02:57:09.771 --> 02:57:10.472]  They're doing it.
[02:57:11.232 --> 02:57:11.752]  Here's another one.
[02:57:11.772 --> 02:57:13.633]  Time Magazine, death by fluoride.
[02:57:14.073 --> 02:57:23.795]  Goes back to a guy who killed a bunch of mental patients by putting extra fluoride in their milk and in their eggs.
[02:57:23.815 --> 02:57:25.096]  I mean, that's Time Magazine.
[02:57:25.356 --> 02:57:26.396]  Death by fluoride.
[02:57:27.636 --> 02:57:32.557]  Eighty-five percent of kids' drinks, snacks contain, could contain high levels of lead.
[02:57:33.478 --> 02:57:34.678]  That's mainstream news.
[02:57:34.718 --> 02:57:38.519]  I mean, this is the type of stuff that I'm looking at each and every day.
[02:57:40.233 --> 02:57:42.253]  They bankrupt you to drive you into submission.
[02:57:42.273 --> 02:57:44.434]  They bankrupt you to make you be under the control of the government.
[02:57:44.454 --> 02:57:48.955]  They socialize health care so they can literally have panels that decide what health care you get.
[02:57:48.995 --> 02:57:49.735]  This is on record.
[02:57:49.755 --> 02:57:51.035]  This is what the White House is now saying.
[02:57:52.116 --> 02:57:53.136]  Here's CNS News.
[02:57:53.236 --> 02:58:00.277]  Obesity rating for every American must be included in stimulus mandated electronic health records tracking how much you weigh.
[02:58:00.697 --> 02:58:02.018]  That's in the stimulus bill.
[02:58:02.738 --> 02:58:03.318]  That's passed.
[02:58:06.038 --> 02:58:07.500]  We have got to warn everyone.
[02:58:07.560 --> 02:58:08.541]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:58:08.561 --> 02:58:11.284]  We should take over our cities peacefully and say no fluoride.
[02:58:11.604 --> 02:58:16.469]  And when they say they're putting fluoride in, that's a catch term for hundreds of other deadly chemicals.
[02:58:17.410 --> 02:58:19.612]  We should tell them, don't genetically modify our crops.
[02:58:19.652 --> 02:58:21.935]  Don't genetically modify the salmon with insect genes.
[02:58:23.285 --> 02:58:28.767]  When the studies show it will cause the regular salmon's population to go extinct within 40 generations.
[02:58:28.807 --> 02:58:29.488]  That's 40 years.
[02:58:29.868 --> 02:58:30.628]  One generation a year.
[02:58:31.149 --> 02:58:32.289]  I mean, that's mainstream news.
[02:58:32.329 --> 02:58:33.370]  McClatchy newspapers.
[02:58:33.730 --> 02:58:36.691]  They admit the aspartame's causing miscarriages and death.
[02:58:36.731 --> 02:58:37.511]  Mainstream news.
[02:58:37.972 --> 02:58:39.152]  We gotta warn people.
[02:58:39.192 --> 02:58:41.453]  This is more important than Lindsay Lohan.
[02:58:41.473 --> 02:58:42.874]  It's incredible!
[02:58:46.315 --> 02:58:48.376]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:54.168 --> 02:58:55.981]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you
