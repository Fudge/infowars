[00:00:13.172 --> 00:00:13.532]  Eastern.
[00:00:14.172 --> 00:00:15.893]  Max Keiser's coming up in the next hour.
[00:00:16.493 --> 00:00:20.115]  I want to at least get to these calls that are on the board, Kerry, John, Mark, Ben, and others.
[00:00:20.575 --> 00:00:25.637]  Then I want to start getting into a lot of the news ahead of Keiser joining us on the economic front.
[00:00:25.677 --> 00:00:26.637]  A lot happening there.
[00:00:28.018 --> 00:00:33.440]  But not only am I going to pay some bills right now, this is also how we get the word out and wake people up.

[00:00:42.198 --> 00:00:43.760]  Started shipping him out late last week.
[00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:46.543]  American Conspiracy.
[00:00:46.603 --> 00:00:49.446]  Jesse Ventura with Dick Russell.
[00:00:49.526 --> 00:00:50.266]  Amazing book.

[00:02:12.156 --> 00:02:13.377]  Covers so many issues.

[00:02:29.687 --> 00:02:32.367]  That I've been working on with Rob Dew and Jason Douglas for the last year.
[00:02:35.628 --> 00:02:38.088]  So that's for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:40.849]  If you're not a PrisonPlanet.tv member, go sign up today.
[00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:44.170]  Okay, I want to get into the news here in a moment.
[00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.250]  The center is to be detained as enemy belligerents.
[00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:57.192]  This is just... We knew it was coming, but it's still... Just disgusting to see him actually doing it.
[00:02:58.171 --> 00:02:59.612]  Let's go to Kerry.
[00:03:01.433 --> 00:03:02.975]  Kerry in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:03:04.396 --> 00:03:13.002]  Hey Alex, whenever you start walking through this grid of evil that's being established, I can't help but think of the Luciferian creed of do as thou wilt.
[00:03:13.022 --> 00:03:22.829]  Because that's what holds us all together, whether it's torturing children or genetically modifying food or lies or abortion, whatever it is, it goes back to that
[00:03:23.834 --> 00:03:30.618]  People don't like to admit that Luciferianism that's integral with the whole elitist thinking, but it's there.
[00:03:30.678 --> 00:03:31.799]  You can't get around it.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:40.765]  And to the last caller, you mentioned how you get frustrated that you can't, that people think you're exaggerating when you say the things that are true.
[00:03:40.785 --> 00:03:52.272]  And I understand some people thought you were exaggerating when you were talking last week about aspartic acid and the bacteria that secrete it that is used to make aspartame.
[00:03:53.044 --> 00:03:57.868]  It's absolutely true, and something that's even more common than aspartame is the citric acid.
[00:03:58.348 --> 00:04:02.292]  Citric acid is produced by Aspergillus Niger, a fungus.
[00:04:02.412 --> 00:04:05.274]  It's excreted by a fungus that's submerged in molasses.
[00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:12.740]  And it's not only a fungus, it's a fungus that's been radiated with gamma rays to genetically modify it.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.861]  It's a mutant.
[00:04:13.941 --> 00:04:17.925]  I mean, it sounds insane when you say this stuff, but anybody could search engine
[00:04:19.163 --> 00:04:24.908]  No, we're eating total frankenfoods, and I've read about that as well, but we know that the
[00:04:27.014 --> 00:04:33.036]  The excretion of these genetically engineered bacteria is a toxic, highly addictive poison, aspartame.
[00:04:33.676 --> 00:04:39.879]  And now you can't, at any store I've gone to, can't find any gum that doesn't have it, even if it's not sugar-free.
[00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.379]  They know it's brain-damaging people.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.120]  It's so diabolical.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.801]  I mean, they're just poisoning everything.
[00:04:46.261 --> 00:04:48.802]  And it's genetically engineered bacteria crap.
[00:04:49.582 --> 00:04:52.385]  And every time I mention that, I get emails saying, oh, it's ridiculous.
[00:04:52.985 --> 00:04:53.686]  No, it's not.
[00:04:53.706 --> 00:05:01.954]  I mean, people just can't believe the magnitude of the elite playing God and doing everything they can to destroy creation.
[00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:09.962]  Meanwhile, selling us on a world government to save the environment by taxing carbon dioxide that's good for the environment.
[00:05:09.982 --> 00:05:13.866]  See, they know people are concerned about the Earth, because there are a lot of problems.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.325]  And so they create a fake counterfeit of that, which is attacking something good to have total control.
[00:05:21.345 --> 00:05:22.666]  I appreciate your call, Kerry.
[00:05:22.886 --> 00:05:23.607]  Good to hear from you.
[00:05:23.747 --> 00:05:32.214]  It's just... There are thousands of genetically modified organisms that they've already made that we're eating.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.381]  And I tell people this and they won't even go look it up.
[00:05:41.401 --> 00:05:42.442]  They'll just think it's not true.
[00:05:46.963 --> 00:05:48.764]  John in Washington, you're on the air.
[00:05:49.284 --> 00:05:50.224]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[00:05:51.845 --> 00:06:04.630]  The reason I was calling on finding a good fight here in Spokane, Washington, and getting out 200 DVDs, handing them out for free, thanks to you not copyrighting your DVDs.
[00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:11.792]  But my question today was, how close do you think we are?
[00:06:11.912 --> 00:06:13.533]  You know, the FEMA camps scare me.
[00:06:13.673 --> 00:06:15.734]  I'm not sure about you, but...
[00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:19.910]  John, I appreciate your call.
[00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.711]  What scares me is letting evil win.
[00:06:23.471 --> 00:06:25.232]  We already live in a big FEMA camp.
[00:06:25.632 --> 00:06:31.775]  Checkpoints, license plate readers, the children are being trained to thumb scan to get their lunch or library books.
[00:06:32.055 --> 00:06:34.156]  They're being trained to be searched without warrants.
[00:06:34.976 --> 00:06:37.417]  We already have more people in prison than even China.
[00:06:38.037 --> 00:06:42.720]  And they've got the legislation to designate all the old military bases as FEMA camps.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.960]  They will continue to destroy the economy.
[00:06:45.001 --> 00:06:48.122]  They will continue to incrementally have people go bankrupt.
[00:06:49.312 --> 00:06:59.299]  And then they'll advertise the government centers, you know, federal and state, federally funded state homeless centers that are little prisons as their FEMA camps.
[00:06:59.739 --> 00:07:04.582]  And they will pass legislation to arrest people for their political views.
[00:07:05.042 --> 00:07:06.483]  That bill is now introduced.
[00:07:09.505 --> 00:07:11.286]  I'm going to cover that after we finish calls here in a moment.
[00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.851]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:22.021]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Maryland.
[00:07:22.061 --> 00:07:22.822]  Mark, you're on the air.
[00:07:23.662 --> 00:07:24.803]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:07:24.823 --> 00:07:25.924]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:07:26.465 --> 00:07:27.706]  We've talked a few times.
[00:07:28.026 --> 00:07:39.054]  I'm the guy that helped with that VFW thing about the inventory that they took with the getting back the military firearms.
[00:07:39.434 --> 00:07:43.037]  That's right, all the old firearms from World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam.
[00:07:43.337 --> 00:07:46.600]  The government's registering them all with the VFW, of course, for confiscation.
[00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:48.751]  Alex, you've got to let me focus here.
[00:07:48.771 --> 00:07:58.375]  I'm nowhere near as good as you are, but I have what I believe might be a solution, a proactive, peaceful solution that everybody can take part in, that cares to take part in it.
[00:07:58.955 --> 00:08:00.095]  I'd like to share it with you.
[00:08:00.636 --> 00:08:04.697]  The first thing I'd like to say is there's a little problem with enemy identification we're having.
[00:08:05.358 --> 00:08:08.719]  You do a really great job of exposing all these things.
[00:08:10.084 --> 00:08:11.465]  I mean, what are we exposing now?
[00:08:11.525 --> 00:08:13.206]  I mean, they're doing it in plain sight.
[00:08:13.566 --> 00:08:24.816]  What we're really doing is just clarifying what they're doing and, you know, exposing what Benedict Beck, I mean, that guy, you can't tell me he doesn't have a college education.
[00:08:25.216 --> 00:08:28.879]  He's so subliminal in his methods and floating those pictures around.
[00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.613]  The stock market, it's completely controlled.
[00:08:33.073 --> 00:08:34.615]  Goldman Sachs is all over that.
[00:08:35.536 --> 00:08:43.183]  We've got to tell people who the enemy is, because if you get punched in the face, your first reflex is to punch back.
[00:08:43.864 --> 00:08:51.952]  Whether it's happening for real or it's false flag, flying into the side of an IRS building, that's not the enemy.
[00:08:52.472 --> 00:08:54.254]  The enemy, I believe,
[00:08:55.034 --> 00:08:58.459]  And you can't name individual people because they'll take you off the air.
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.965]  But, I mean, we got the CFR and things like that.
[00:09:02.466 --> 00:09:06.608]  When you can direct people and tell them, it's the bankers, who are the bankers?
[00:09:07.408 --> 00:09:11.490]  Well, there was actually a Bloomberg article, what, two months ago, guys?
[00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:12.031]  Will you pull it?
[00:09:12.671 --> 00:09:20.915]  Bloomberg arming, it's a Bloomberg article, headline, Goldman Sachs arming themselves for people attacking them.
[00:09:21.975 --> 00:09:23.336]  And that will just turn them into victims.
[00:09:23.376 --> 00:09:26.238]  We need to expose these criminals, not do anything violent to them.
[00:09:26.698 --> 00:09:31.000]  But the reason, notice it is the IRS, it is the military being attacked.
[00:09:32.031 --> 00:09:43.779]  And the reason, we know this is staged for many reasons, but they preparatory, they prepared the public that there would be attacks on these very installations, then it happened so they could demonize their political enemies.
[00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:54.886]  And I've been saying it's the season for that, made the prediction, it's all come true in triplicate, which just further concerns me because I know where we're going in the next phase and I don't like it.
[00:09:56.136 --> 00:09:58.677]  And, yeah, the UN's not being attacked.
[00:09:59.037 --> 00:10:00.857]  The Federal Reserve's not being attacked.
[00:10:01.358 --> 00:10:03.038]  Goldman Sachs isn't being attacked.
[00:10:03.098 --> 00:10:05.559]  The Council on Foreign Relations isn't being attacked.
[00:10:06.319 --> 00:10:07.579]  These people are not being attacked.
[00:10:07.619 --> 00:10:11.901]  The real system is not attacking themselves in these staged terror attacks.
[00:10:12.301 --> 00:10:18.983]  They're attacking their own police and military and enforcers and parasite suckers at the IRS.
[00:10:21.331 --> 00:10:27.781]  Because they want to get their culture to get into more war-like mode against us, the people.
[00:10:28.122 --> 00:10:30.105]  And they're internally teaching them that we are the enemy.
[00:10:30.936 --> 00:10:32.858]  Go ahead and taser that scum if they talk back.
[00:10:33.098 --> 00:10:33.919]  Go ahead and beat them up.
[00:10:33.939 --> 00:10:36.101]  Go ahead and torture them, because they want to kill you.
[00:10:37.242 --> 00:10:45.991]  It's meant to get them in an us-against-them mentality, and to also have people that are angry at the government say, Yay, Joe Stack!
[00:10:46.031 --> 00:10:46.512]  Yay!
[00:10:46.532 --> 00:10:52.698]  You know, the guy at the Pentagon, as some people have done, so that the establishment can get
[00:10:54.085 --> 00:10:59.852]  The opposition to the New World Order going against their minions instead of actually against the elite.
[00:11:00.392 --> 00:11:10.383]  And that it's also meant for just the general public to scare them away from joining a tea party or a birther or a truth movement or an in-the-Fed movement because, oh my gosh, they're connected to violence.
[00:11:11.323 --> 00:11:22.086]  So, we know the PSYOP, we know why they're doing it, but yes, the fact that you never see real globalist targets being hit is another indicator.
[00:11:22.126 --> 00:11:24.827]  It's always their low-level minions.
[00:11:25.147 --> 00:11:26.007]  So that's the bottom line.
[00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:29.648]  I have a small solution I believe would work.
[00:11:29.668 --> 00:11:30.909]  It's proactive, it's peaceful.
[00:11:30.929 --> 00:11:31.569]  Go ahead and get to it.
[00:11:32.309 --> 00:11:32.629]  Okay.
[00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:38.631]  What I believe, and every solution has risk, and it's all going to come down to the few in the end anyway.
[00:11:39.318 --> 00:11:41.899]  That's all we've got is a few.
[00:11:42.279 --> 00:11:45.019]  We can wake a few people up, but most people are not going to get involved.
[00:11:45.039 --> 00:11:45.279]  I understand.
[00:11:45.299 --> 00:11:46.039]  What's your solution?
[00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:46.859]  I've got to move quicker.
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:51.100]  Well, the solution is they want to take down the banks.
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.741]  People don't understand that it's not going to be a sudden crash.
[00:11:55.801 --> 00:11:57.981]  It's going to be a frog boiling in water.
[00:11:58.382 --> 00:11:59.582]  Just like Solante said.
[00:11:59.622 --> 00:12:02.762]  Now, you and Solante said that people need to get involved.
[00:12:02.842 --> 00:12:04.183]  Here's how to get involved.
[00:12:04.883 --> 00:12:05.943]  And you can't do it
[00:12:07.108 --> 00:12:16.313]  In their face, you have to do it by telling people that it's against the law to tell anyone to take the banks down.
[00:12:17.194 --> 00:12:19.115]  You can't cause a run on the banks.
[00:12:19.756 --> 00:12:25.199]  Now see, if you take your money out of the bank, you get to keep your money, and you can defeat the world order.
[00:12:25.359 --> 00:12:29.821]  Alright, I'm going to have to put you on hold and come back to you.
[00:12:29.841 --> 00:12:30.582]  What's the caller's name?
[00:12:33.203 --> 00:12:36.386]  I'm going to go back to you in a minute, Mark, but I need to hear it cut and dry.
[00:12:37.367 --> 00:12:37.668]  Okay?
[00:12:41.491 --> 00:12:48.799]  I'm not sure what your solution is yet, but if you're saying, identifying or saying the banks are going down as illegal.
[00:12:51.892 --> 00:13:04.382]  The big central banks in October of 2008 said we were going to have a depression to destroy their competition and to terrorize Congress into going against the Bill of Rights Constitution and the will of the people.
[00:13:04.442 --> 00:13:08.004]  That was and is financial terrorism.
[00:13:08.044 --> 00:13:09.646]  That's what Fall of the Republic covers.
[00:13:13.188 --> 00:13:14.729]  And they brought down Iceland.
[00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:17.752]  Iceland said, no, we're not paying you the money it's not owed.
[00:13:18.991 --> 00:13:22.113]  Greece is totally controlled by Goldman Sachs, so they're going along with it.
[00:13:23.533 --> 00:13:24.414]  Total raping.
[00:13:26.975 --> 00:13:28.876]  Now go ahead, Mark, finish up.
[00:13:29.376 --> 00:13:30.717]  Okay, they're raping us.
[00:13:30.817 --> 00:13:36.740]  What I'm saying is, I mean, we can't re-elect any, we can't get honest people in because we're not communicating.
[00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:37.160]  Well, what is it?
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.201]  Okay, so that's the solution, we can't get honest people in.
[00:13:39.261 --> 00:13:40.002]  What are you saying?
[00:13:40.622 --> 00:13:45.244]  I'm saying that he who takes the banks out first keeps the money.
[00:13:45.584 --> 00:13:48.506]  They're trying to take the banks out, they're taking our money.
[00:13:49.108 --> 00:13:56.295]  If we were to do it, we the people, this would communicate to our lawmakers that we're on top of this, we know.
[00:13:56.815 --> 00:14:10.467]  So what we do is we get together with George Norrie and a few of the others that are willing to take the risk, they can't go for everybody, and we just tell people over and over again that it's against the law to withdraw all your money the week of June 19th.
[00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:23.138]  And if everybody gets the message that it's against the law to tell everybody to take their money out of the bank on June 19th, the week of June 19th, guess what people who are listening are going to do?
[00:14:23.158 --> 00:14:26.000]  And I mean, if you understand what I'm saying.
[00:14:26.601 --> 00:14:27.662]  They're going to go pull their money out.
[00:14:27.702 --> 00:14:30.444]  I appreciate your idea, but I don't agree with it.
[00:14:31.485 --> 00:14:37.371]  I'm not saying your idea is cockamamie, but there aren't silver bullets in this.
[00:14:40.987 --> 00:14:43.809]  The general public has a fraction of the money.
[00:14:44.549 --> 00:14:51.414]  The banks have created thousands of times fiat currency and credit, what the entire planet owns and has.
[00:14:51.994 --> 00:14:56.838]  That's why they need to destroy the economy to make you go bankrupt, so they get your property and land.
[00:14:57.518 --> 00:14:59.019]  It's all, it's a Ponzi scheme.
[00:14:59.299 --> 00:15:06.164]  But when they pop the Ponzi scheme, they get all the real material, like Greece's islands and their infrastructure.
[00:15:06.884 --> 00:15:14.067]  Or Argentina's mines, and their roads, and their lakes, and their fields, and their national parks, and all of our ports.
[00:15:14.407 --> 00:15:16.167]  We're already deep into receivership.
[00:15:18.068 --> 00:15:24.090]  I do think getting your money out of the big Federal Reserve Banks is good.
[00:15:26.231 --> 00:15:31.153]  The Goldman Sachs, the JPMorgan Chase's, the Bank of America's.
[00:15:32.955 --> 00:15:36.719]  It is good to support local banks, credit unions, things like that.
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:41.945]  But see, when we talk about crash, they're not going to probably crash things overnight and not let you have your money.
[00:15:42.246 --> 00:15:44.548]  They're just going to devalue the value of your money.
[00:15:44.588 --> 00:15:49.254]  See, the human mind works from a psychological perspective.
[00:15:51.078 --> 00:15:53.640]  In a primitive way, like, how do I kill a saber-toothed tiger?
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.721]  Well, I get up here on a cliff and I throw boulders at it.
[00:15:56.341 --> 00:15:59.043]  Like, you know, you do one thing and it brings them down.
[00:15:59.063 --> 00:16:07.708]  And that's why the movies, it's all Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone or whoever the hero is.
[00:16:12.271 --> 00:16:17.294]  Going out and beating everything overnight with one big devastating swoop
[00:16:20.031 --> 00:16:21.192]  And that isn't how it works.
[00:16:22.173 --> 00:16:22.533]  Okay?
[00:16:23.594 --> 00:16:27.396]  You identify that the banks engaged in financial terrorism to take over.
[00:16:27.657 --> 00:16:30.399]  That they bait and switched and kept the money and won't say where it went.
[00:16:31.259 --> 00:16:34.822]  That they're openly setting up a bank of the world and taking over the planet right now.
[00:16:36.143 --> 00:16:42.848]  See, I had incredible news to get to here, and I wanted to quickly go to calls, but that's why some days I don't take calls.
[00:16:42.868 --> 00:16:49.533]  Not that your calls were bad, it just burns up time and sometimes takes us in interesting directions, sometimes not.
[00:16:53.326 --> 00:16:55.068]  I have news here in front of me.
[00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.512]  Dissenters to be detained as enemy belligerents.
[00:17:01.393 --> 00:17:03.455]  This is also in Atlantic Magazine.
[00:17:03.575 --> 00:17:05.417]  And again, we're going to give you a document cam shot here.
[00:17:07.959 --> 00:17:09.500]  For PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[00:17:09.941 --> 00:17:12.543]  A detention bill you ought to read more carefully.
[00:17:12.663 --> 00:17:13.344]  It's in the Atlantic.
[00:17:13.644 --> 00:17:15.446]  Here's the PrisonPlanet.com article.
[00:17:15.486 --> 00:17:19.049]  Dissenters to be detained as enemy belligerents.
[00:17:20.939 --> 00:17:35.755]  And this says in Section 5 you can be secretly arrested, interrogated, tortured under the Enemy Belligerent Interrogation Detention Act, Prosecution Act of 2010 for any such matters as the President considers appropriate for U.S.
[00:17:35.795 --> 00:17:36.236]  citizens.
[00:17:37.133 --> 00:17:47.036]  So we'll talk some about this with Kaiser, but I'm going to have to push off now to the last hour for the big news blitz, where I'm going to break down the big picture here of what they're going to carry out and what they're going to do.
[00:17:47.476 --> 00:17:50.156]  I'll come back and we'll talk to Dustin, Monica, Zach, and Melissa.
[00:17:50.436 --> 00:17:54.898]  Please have your questions and comments ready quickly, because I need to be able to move on, but I still want to hear from you.
[00:17:55.278 --> 00:17:55.878]  This is a Catch-22.
[00:17:59.457 --> 00:18:00.717]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:18:00.777 --> 00:18:06.119]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:18:06.359 --> 00:18:10.980]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:16.442]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:18:16.942 --> 00:18:21.623]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[00:18:56.141 --> 00:18:58.523]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:18:59.269 --> 00:19:00.910]  Great news for pure water lovers!

[00:20:00.745 --> 00:20:02.146]  Is it safe to breathe anymore?
[00:20:02.386 --> 00:20:13.492]  Crowded public places, global pandemics and news reports of potential new strains of bacteria and viruses make you wonder, what if there was a germ killing nasal spray that acted almost like hand sanitizer for your nose?

[00:20:56.912 --> 00:20:57.473]  It works.
[00:21:05.157 --> 00:21:10.482]  Well, the IMF has publicly announced what we told you in December they were going to do.
[00:21:12.724 --> 00:21:20.891]  They are going to have every Western government pay masses of money to them to openly set up world government and force carbon taxes on everyone.
[00:21:22.793 --> 00:21:24.194]  Completely lawless and criminal.
[00:21:26.756 --> 00:21:30.159]  Continuing with your phone calls, we're going to get into that in the next hour with Max Keiser.
[00:21:30.519 --> 00:21:32.081]  Dustin in Illinois, you're on the air.
[00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:36.012]  Hey Alex, I just want to say you're doing a great job.
[00:21:36.052 --> 00:21:39.755]  Your knowledge is just unbelievable.
[00:21:40.375 --> 00:21:43.358]  I refer to you as America's alarm clock.
[00:21:43.778 --> 00:21:45.720]  You're constantly waking people up.
[00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:49.082]  Keep up the good work and keep kicking ass.
[00:21:49.222 --> 00:21:54.246]  And I also wanted to know what your thoughts was of the Discovery Channel.
[00:21:54.647 --> 00:21:58.650]  They're having that Underworld Bomber premiering this Thursday.
[00:22:00.305 --> 00:22:04.107]  Well, I don't really pay attention, but the underwear bomber was admittedly staged by the government.
[00:22:04.127 --> 00:22:05.608]  They let him on the plane, protected him.
[00:22:05.628 --> 00:22:06.489]  Mainstream news.
[00:22:06.909 --> 00:22:08.970]  To sell the body scanners in the police state.
[00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:11.051]  Because their target's the American people.
[00:22:11.091 --> 00:22:11.992]  They know we fly.
[00:22:12.372 --> 00:22:16.695]  They beta test their control surveillance grid, uh, when people...
[00:22:17.936 --> 00:22:18.856]  are in the airports.
[00:22:18.896 --> 00:22:23.438]  Now they're going to move it to mobile brain scanning and naked body scanning systems.
[00:22:23.698 --> 00:22:31.702]  We've got video from Homeland Security coming up later in the broadcast and how it ties into dissenters to be detained as enemy belligerents.
[00:22:32.182 --> 00:22:32.702]  New bill.
[00:22:33.242 --> 00:22:34.043]  Thank you for the call.
[00:22:34.883 --> 00:22:41.706]  John McCain to completely get rid of any Bill of Rights, any habeas corpus, anything.
[00:22:41.726 --> 00:22:43.686]  And it says you can be interrogated.
[00:22:44.827 --> 00:22:45.807]  Oh, heaven help us.
[00:22:45.887 --> 00:22:47.428]  Monica in New York, you're on the air.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:55.242]  Hello Alex, yes, you are unbelievably a watchman on the wall.
[00:22:56.082 --> 00:23:05.285]  And I say that not as just to affirm you, but God has equipped you to be able to do this, I'm telling you.
[00:23:06.105 --> 00:23:07.026]  And we see that.
[00:23:08.547 --> 00:23:15.094]  And this morning, I was just unctioned to just, I mean it was like really hard to press through to pray.
[00:23:15.114 --> 00:23:23.563]  And you will be lifted up in prayer, and not only that, and when you first started the program, how you were, it was like birthing something.
[00:23:24.544 --> 00:23:27.747]  I think people in the spirit need to realize
[00:23:29.508 --> 00:23:36.995]  And there is an evil will trying to force us to not resist it.
[00:23:37.895 --> 00:23:38.576]  It's a spirit.
[00:23:40.438 --> 00:23:47.744]  That's what it is, forcing down upon us to go along with the system, to be evil, to be worldly, to not have courage.
[00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:53.913]  I feel like today I have passed over another line.
[00:23:53.953 --> 00:23:57.517]  This has happened to me before in a progression of discernment and awakening.
[00:23:58.298 --> 00:24:04.824]  And the reason I'm waking up even more, and other people are as well, is because the enemy is rising right now.
[00:24:05.545 --> 00:24:10.430]  And God is trying to lift you up, the listeners, against this enemy.
[00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:12.893]  And I just realized the position I'm in
[00:24:14.548 --> 00:24:16.529]  And I just say, why God?
[00:24:16.649 --> 00:24:18.149]  Why is the world this way?
[00:24:18.249 --> 00:24:22.851]  Why do I understand this and a lot of other people can't if they could just know what I know?
[00:24:23.431 --> 00:24:23.691]  Yeah.
[00:24:24.292 --> 00:24:28.473]  And we don't need to know, like not all people need to know all specific things.
[00:24:28.933 --> 00:24:30.254]  I really believe in the spiritual.
[00:24:30.294 --> 00:24:34.475]  You're dealing with a dimension where you're operating and you know.
[00:24:34.495 --> 00:24:36.076]  It's an all-knowing, true,
[00:24:37.327 --> 00:24:37.928]  You know what I mean?
[00:24:37.968 --> 00:24:43.496]  It's like God can download it to you, and there is no fear in it when God's there.
[00:24:43.716 --> 00:24:44.858]  Well, that's what it's like, though.
[00:24:44.878 --> 00:24:47.101]  I mean, I knew they were going to stage an attack in Austin.
[00:24:47.181 --> 00:24:50.145]  I knew they were going to stage attacks and blame it on 9-11 Truth.
[00:24:50.185 --> 00:24:52.628]  And I said, it'll happen in the next month, and it happened.
[00:24:52.648 --> 00:24:53.790]  And then I know...
[00:24:54.611 --> 00:24:59.815]  Pretty much what they're going to do next, I'm going to try to really formulate my thoughts and cover it in the last hour.
[00:24:59.895 --> 00:25:02.356]  It's just, it's like watching a train coming.
[00:25:02.416 --> 00:25:06.979]  You see it coming and you're saying, look, there's the train and people don't see it and it runs them over.
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:08.300]  How can they not see it?
[00:25:09.101 --> 00:25:11.563]  It's spiritual psychology is what it is.
[00:25:12.143 --> 00:25:20.869]  You have to understand and see a pattern in it in order for you to operate the way you do in the very thing that God allows you to do it.

[00:25:49.648 --> 00:25:53.290]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:56.672]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:25:56.912 --> 00:26:01.694]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:26:01.714 --> 00:26:07.978]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:26:08.118 --> 00:26:10.359]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:26:10.859 --> 00:26:12.281]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:26:12.301 --> 00:26:13.021]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:26:13.041 --> 00:26:15.143]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:26:29.778 --> 00:26:31.619]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:26:31.919 --> 00:26:36.743]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:26:37.063 --> 00:26:46.989]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:26:51.592 --> 00:26:53.514]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:26:53.974 --> 00:26:56.756]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:03.177 --> 00:27:07.340]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:27:08.001 --> 00:27:08.802]  You want answers?
[00:27:09.562 --> 00:27:10.483]  Well, so does he.
[00:27:11.143 --> 00:27:14.786]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:15.327 --> 00:27:19.450]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:21.091 --> 00:27:23.814]  It is Monday, March 8, 2010.
[00:27:23.994 --> 00:27:28.818]  For the next 60 minutes, joining us from France is Max Kaiser.
[00:27:30.103 --> 00:27:34.104]  I want to get into the state of the world economy with him, but I also want to talk about the Joe Stack attack.
[00:27:34.124 --> 00:27:35.364]  A lot of evidence that was staged.
[00:27:35.825 --> 00:27:36.445]  The Pentagon attack.
[00:27:52.898 --> 00:27:57.800]  We saw preconditioning that 9-11 truthers were going to get violent before anyone had ever gotten violent.
[00:27:58.181 --> 00:28:01.562]  And I saw the media putting that out and I said, look, they're about to stage something.
[00:28:01.582 --> 00:28:03.103]  And now it turns out his parents warned.
[00:28:04.243 --> 00:28:08.906]  Turns out he's got government connections with weird government contracts and communications with the Pentagon.
[00:28:09.486 --> 00:28:10.707]  Same thing with Joe Stack.
[00:28:12.307 --> 00:28:16.169]  But regardless, they are really demonizing everybody right now.
[00:28:16.229 --> 00:28:19.591]  The Southern Poverty Law Center is attacking me every day.
[00:28:21.018 --> 00:28:23.919]  They're demonizing the Tea Parties, they're going after everybody.
[00:28:24.539 --> 00:28:29.720]  So we'll talk about that with Max Keiser as well, because the people are really starting to wake up.
[00:28:30.601 --> 00:28:32.061]  The banks control both parties.
[00:28:33.061 --> 00:28:40.564]  The good news is, I want to cover first, Iceland voters reject repayment plan, and how that dovetails with this AP article.
[00:28:41.364 --> 00:28:45.025]  IMF suggests how to raise climate change funds, pay money directly to them.
[00:28:46.081 --> 00:28:52.682]  So we'll talk about the open expansion of this private banking world government with Max Keiser.
[00:28:53.223 --> 00:28:54.783]  Max Keiser, good to have you here with us.
[00:28:55.783 --> 00:28:57.604]  Hey Alex, good to be back with you.
[00:28:59.104 --> 00:29:00.544]  So much is going on.
[00:29:01.184 --> 00:29:05.765]  Let's talk in general terms first about the world economy.
[00:29:05.825 --> 00:29:12.527]  More and more analysts are saying, look, we've got 22% unemployment, we're really in a depression, things are getting worse, not better.
[00:29:12.567 --> 00:29:13.247]  Where is this going?
[00:29:15.203 --> 00:29:26.667]  Yeah, well, as we've talked about before, it's a global phenomenon, what I call the global insurrection against banking occupation.
[00:29:27.647 --> 00:29:32.069]  We're seeing it in Iceland, we're seeing it in Greece, we're seeing it in countries all over the world.
[00:29:32.589 --> 00:29:36.451]  It started in 2007 with the beginning of the credit crunch.
[00:29:36.591 --> 00:29:37.471]  We first started to
[00:29:38.044 --> 00:29:40.324]  Understand what was happening with the credit crunch.
[00:29:40.364 --> 00:29:47.626]  Remember, over there at Citigroup, the CEO of Citigroup, Chuck Prince, said, as long as the music keeps going, we're going to keep dancing.
[00:29:48.266 --> 00:30:02.749]  What he meant by that was, as long as the Fed was going to continue to print money in ways that we could borrow and securitize our way into these phony profits, we're going to continue to do so, even though our underlying basic business model is corrupt.
[00:30:03.609 --> 00:30:04.829]  Well, anyway, the music stopped.
[00:30:05.609 --> 00:30:07.810]  And this was the beginning of the global credit crunch.
[00:30:08.331 --> 00:30:09.572]  It was huge in 2008.
[00:30:10.232 --> 00:30:17.417]  There was a bit of a respite in 2009 because of the stimulus package, which was basically nothing more than a bit of a sugar high.
[00:30:18.057 --> 00:30:25.682]  And now in 2010, it's the resumption of this global crunch, this credit crunch, this deflation, this depression.
[00:30:26.181 --> 00:30:29.964]  And the people in various countries around the world are starting to fight back.
[00:30:29.984 --> 00:30:31.545]  They're fighting back in Iceland.
[00:30:31.565 --> 00:30:33.186]  They're fighting back in Greece.
[00:30:33.286 --> 00:30:35.268]  So it's not just in the U.S.
[00:30:35.768 --> 00:30:43.514]  that people are being disenfranchised by the tyranny that's going on on the level of the investment banks.
[00:30:45.382 --> 00:31:01.505]  And worldwide, I've seen the news, in Iceland, in Spain, in Greece, the media is implying that the anti-banking parties, the anti-looting parties, are terrorists or radical, and so look for events to be staged and blamed on the opposition there.
[00:31:01.845 --> 00:31:11.848]  But I don't think that these staged provocations, or in some cases the establishment allowing nuts to attack the government, is going to make the people love the banks.
[00:31:12.288 --> 00:31:13.488]  I think this isn't going to work, Max.
[00:31:14.775 --> 00:31:15.535]  Well, it's interesting.
[00:31:15.635 --> 00:31:29.901]  In countries like Greece and Iceland, the people understand specifically what the problem is, and they are pushing back directly against the bankers themselves.
[00:31:30.261 --> 00:31:34.703]  In the U.S., the message is very muted, because the mainstream media
[00:31:35.302 --> 00:31:41.765]  is able to get all of the activists to line themselves up into a circular firing line and they all shoot each other.
[00:31:42.506 --> 00:31:43.026]  Exactly!
[00:31:43.066 --> 00:31:43.466]  We're busy.
[00:31:43.726 --> 00:31:50.189]  Republicans bashing Democrats, Democrats bashing Republicans, Republicans and Democrats bashing Alex Jones.
[00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:51.890]  We'll be right back.
[00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:52.871]  Basically shooting at each other.
[00:31:53.331 --> 00:31:54.732]  We'll be right back with Max Keiser.
[00:31:54.752 --> 00:31:55.292]  Stay there, Max.
[00:32:00.393 --> 00:32:04.016]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:04.356 --> 00:32:12.482]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:32:13.223 --> 00:32:17.266]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:32:17.846 --> 00:32:28.655]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:32:29.275 --> 00:32:38.298]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:38.798 --> 00:32:43.860]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:51.403]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:51.723 --> 00:32:54.464]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:32:58.271 --> 00:33:02.514]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:33:02.814 --> 00:33:03.434]  Number one.
[00:33:03.735 --> 00:33:06.897]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:33:07.157 --> 00:33:07.737]  Number two.
[00:33:08.017 --> 00:33:12.580]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:13.361]  It's true.
[00:33:13.661 --> 00:33:18.204]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:33:18.524 --> 00:33:19.064]  Number 3.
[00:33:19.345 --> 00:33:22.627]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:33:22.927 --> 00:33:26.670]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:27.390]  Number 4.
[00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:30.012]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:33:30.412 --> 00:33:33.794]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:33:34.095 --> 00:33:34.295]  Number 5.
[00:33:34.855 --> 00:33:38.797]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:33:39.017 --> 00:33:43.779]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:33:44.059 --> 00:33:48.100]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.801]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:33:58.049 --> 00:34:04.913]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:34:05.053 --> 00:34:06.994]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:34:07.135 --> 00:34:09.236]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:34:09.376 --> 00:34:10.877]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:34:11.017 --> 00:34:15.359]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[00:35:00.316 --> 00:35:06.358]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:35:06.938 --> 00:35:09.979]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:11.359 --> 00:35:16.220]  Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com is our guest for the rest of the hour.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:22.882]  We're going to open the phones up for people specifically with questions for Max Keiser at the bottom of the hour.
[00:35:25.478 --> 00:35:26.299]  It's very simple.
[00:35:27.019 --> 00:35:33.886]  Less than 20 big central banks openly are setting up world governments saying we're going to pay our carbon taxes to them.
[00:35:34.586 --> 00:35:40.071]  They go into nations, set up these derivative systems to get people deeply in fraudulent debt.
[00:35:41.132 --> 00:35:42.894]  They want the resources of the nation.
[00:35:42.934 --> 00:35:46.798]  They pay off the politicians to buy into the Ponzi schemes.
[00:35:47.158 --> 00:35:50.001]  But instead of going to prison like Bernie Madoff or Ken Lay,
[00:35:51.451 --> 00:36:05.555]  When they implode the economy, they get even more power and they use paramilitary, military-industrial complex systems and television brainwashing to play the public off against each other and to suppress and demonize anybody else that wakes up.
[00:36:05.895 --> 00:36:15.779]  But Max, the reason I talk about myself here is that I have Time Magazine, New York Times, Newsweek, Southern Poverty Law Center, they called me today.
[00:36:15.999 --> 00:36:20.200]  They're doing a cover story on their intelligence report demonizing me.
[00:36:22.574 --> 00:36:25.716]  They're misrepresenting who I am, what I stand for, what I'm doing.
[00:36:26.136 --> 00:36:30.819]  They're demonizing anybody that criticizes the banks as racist, which has nothing to do with it.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.262]  They're making it about Obama, which is what they do.
[00:36:34.282 --> 00:36:43.388]  You know, the right wing makes it about Obama, the left wing makes it about the Republicans, to where, as you said, we're a circular firing line all shooting at each other.
[00:36:43.788 --> 00:36:45.489]  They've got the people shooting at each other.
[00:36:45.969 --> 00:36:49.031]  But then, meanwhile, it's pretty creepy to now
[00:36:50.228 --> 00:37:04.047]  Have the London Guardian and just New York Daily News, the Austin American Statesman, no exaggeration, three or four big publications a day saying, I'm dangerous, I'm bad, Alex Jones has caused a huge psychosis globally.
[00:37:05.128 --> 00:37:06.889]  I mean, it's creeping my wife and I out.
[00:37:06.949 --> 00:37:11.251]  I mean, I can handle the heat in the kitchen, but I don't think of myself as that big.
[00:37:11.812 --> 00:37:21.177]  You had recognized previously, and I didn't get you on to talk about me, but I want your advice that I was super effective and that I was being mimicked, and you're more of a media expert than I. You've done it longer than I have.
[00:37:22.878 --> 00:37:24.539]  What do you say to what I'm saying here?
[00:37:24.819 --> 00:37:26.060]  Why do you think this is happening?
[00:37:30.615 --> 00:37:32.637]  Max Keiser's line dropped.
[00:37:32.677 --> 00:37:34.698]  I don't want to do Skype anymore, guys.
[00:37:34.799 --> 00:37:39.322]  It may be a little bit better audio quality, but it just doesn't work to, like, foreign countries and places.
[00:37:40.243 --> 00:37:42.865]  And then we don't notice when the line drops.
[00:37:43.406 --> 00:37:44.907]  It's always good to ask a long question.
[00:37:45.187 --> 00:37:48.690]  Because, I mean, I'm here watching this happen.
[00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:50.151]  I'm watching this go on.
[00:37:50.992 --> 00:37:56.457]  I am seeing it, and I'm seeing myself being held up as the devil.
[00:37:57.594 --> 00:38:00.095]  Because I am identifying the banks as the enemy.
[00:38:00.516 --> 00:38:04.478]  I'm telling people, don't fight with Obama, don't fight with the Republicans.
[00:38:05.458 --> 00:38:07.699]  The leadership is controlled by the same people.
[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:11.121]  We have got to address the real issues.
[00:38:11.521 --> 00:38:12.942]  And we've got to do it now.
[00:38:13.622 --> 00:38:15.083]  And that's what Max Keiser is doing.
[00:38:15.123 --> 00:38:18.165]  Max Keiser, for several years on this show,
[00:38:19.093 --> 00:38:20.234]  That's cause you're so handsome!
[00:38:40.751 --> 00:38:50.340]  No, seriously, because you've been telling me on and off air for the last year or so that I was really having an effect, and I kind of put it off as you analyzing it.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:52.902]  But I'm asking you now, why do you think this is happening?
[00:38:55.064 --> 00:39:05.554]  Well, clearly, as I've been saying, basically, there's this credit crunch.
[00:39:05.574 --> 00:39:06.695]  There's a credit collapse.
[00:39:07.333 --> 00:39:11.055]  And no matter how much money they throw at it, they can't re-inflate the bubble.
[00:39:11.095 --> 00:39:13.356]  They're trying to get the bubble going again.
[00:39:13.396 --> 00:39:14.096]  They can't do it.
[00:39:14.576 --> 00:39:18.238]  So, you know, the people are looking for scapegoats.
[00:39:18.258 --> 00:39:28.702]  You know, the classic propaganda model, going back, you know, to World War II, is first you develop a demagogue, and then you also develop scapegoats.
[00:39:29.003 --> 00:39:34.285]  So under, in Nazi Germany, for example, Hitler was the godlike figure.
[00:39:35.166 --> 00:39:39.709]  And the minorities that they've chosen, that they choose, were the scapegoats.
[00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:44.213]  Now, here we have Lloyd Blankfein over at Goldman Sachs saying he's doing God's work.
[00:39:44.673 --> 00:39:46.794]  He's clearly setting himself up as a demigod.
[00:39:46.934 --> 00:39:48.696]  He's in touch with God.
[00:39:48.736 --> 00:39:49.696]  He's doing God's work.
[00:39:49.997 --> 00:39:53.419]  And for the propaganda model to work, he's got to have scapegoats.
[00:39:53.639 --> 00:39:59.343]  And they give Al Gore awards, they give Obama awards for starting more wars, peace prizes.
[00:39:59.603 --> 00:40:00.424]  So that's the joke.
[00:40:00.464 --> 00:40:01.765]  They're God, we're bad.
[00:40:02.512 --> 00:40:11.259]  You need a scapegoat for the propaganda model to work, because people need to love, they need to fall in love with their captor, and they need to hate somebody.
[00:40:11.759 --> 00:40:13.821]  So that's the way the propaganda model works.
[00:40:14.281 --> 00:40:23.828]  So in America right now, if you're the scapegoat, they need somebody to be the scapegoat.
[00:40:24.048 --> 00:40:26.650]  But this is not unpredictable.
[00:40:27.571 --> 00:40:31.774]  This is the model that we're talking about, because since the credit collapse,
[00:40:32.782 --> 00:40:34.724]  Has eliminated the easy money.
[00:40:35.524 --> 00:40:41.188]  What we have now is this wholesale transference of wealth, what's left, into the pockets of the top 1%.
[00:40:41.968 --> 00:40:46.671]  And they have to do it in a way that everybody kind of thinks is acceptable.
[00:40:47.392 --> 00:41:01.441]  And they do this by scapegoating one portion of the population, by setting themselves up as God, and that they need to continue to transfer wealth to themselves because they need... And that's the model that we've seen before in history, that the model being used
[00:41:01.986 --> 00:41:02.306]  In the U.S.
[00:41:02.506 --> 00:41:02.846]  today.
[00:41:04.286 --> 00:41:11.348]  Well, Max, I mean, you have always identified that the big power structure, Wall Street and others, are in control of both parties.
[00:41:12.388 --> 00:41:22.430]  And you've been identifying the banks, and you talk about the revolt against the banking global dictatorship gaining steam, but they've been more successful in the U.S.
[00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:26.771]  playing different political groups off against each other, divide and conquer.
[00:41:27.731 --> 00:41:32.875]  Specifically, though, what do you see unfolding in Iceland and in Greece?
[00:41:33.255 --> 00:41:39.160]  I mean, for those that don't know, over the weekend, Iceland voters reject repayment plan because it's a fraud.
[00:41:41.021 --> 00:41:45.165]  Yeah, well, as these currencies, you know, remember the Icelandic krona collapse?
[00:41:45.245 --> 00:41:48.607]  I was in Reykjavik a year before the collapse.
[00:41:48.907 --> 00:41:50.288]  I was in the Hotel 101.
[00:41:50.489 --> 00:41:54.732]  I was sitting with bankers from what was still a viable firm, Lehman Brothers.
[00:41:55.222 --> 00:42:05.049]  And they told me that they were planning to attack the Icelandic krona using derivatives, another financial product, and that they were going to take the Icelandic economy down.
[00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:06.851]  I made a film at that time.
[00:42:06.951 --> 00:42:07.811]  I spoke to bankers.
[00:42:07.851 --> 00:42:13.095]  I told them, you know, this economy is going to blow up in less than a year because you are in control of the speculators.
[00:42:13.135 --> 00:42:15.037]  You have lost control of your economy.
[00:42:15.617 --> 00:42:17.538]  And they laughed at me and they said, no, that's impossible.
[00:42:17.919 --> 00:42:23.583]  And of course, less than a year later, the krona collapsed, the Icelandic economy collapsed.
[00:42:23.979 --> 00:42:41.275]  Now we're seeing the same speculators move on to Greece and move on to the Eurozone, where they say to Greece, you know, we're going to collapse your economy unless you give us some of your islands and they should give us some of your tourist attractions, which we can securitize and turn into derivatives and trade with each other for next year's Christmas bonus.
[00:42:41.775 --> 00:42:43.677]  And if you don't do that, we're going to crash your economy.
[00:42:44.025 --> 00:42:48.768]  So they use these derivatives as basically weaponized financial products.
[00:42:49.008 --> 00:42:57.534]  We saw a bank policy, went to Congress and said either give us $700 billion, remember at the end of 2008, either give us $700 billion or we're going to crash your economy.
[00:42:57.594 --> 00:43:00.196]  Now that's, he held the Congress hostage.
[00:43:00.436 --> 00:43:08.642]  To me, I don't understand how he got away with holding the American Congress hostage like this and demanding $700 billion in ransom.
[00:43:10.405 --> 00:43:11.566]  I mean, you know, the U.S.
[00:43:11.646 --> 00:43:14.108]  is crying about pirates in Somalia.
[00:43:14.169 --> 00:43:17.051]  What about the pirates on the floor right there in Congress?
[00:43:17.131 --> 00:43:18.833]  I mean, I don't understand the double standard there.
[00:43:20.114 --> 00:43:21.756]  Well, you may have seen this.
[00:43:21.816 --> 00:43:25.859]  It just came out today, Atlantic Monthly, and I'll give folks a document cam shot of this.
[00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:30.744]  It says, a detention bill you ought to read more carefully.
[00:43:31.344 --> 00:43:33.066]  Again, that's Atlantic Monthly.
[00:43:33.346 --> 00:43:38.771]  Here's the PrisonPlanet.com article, dissenters to be detained as enemy belligerents.
[00:43:38.811 --> 00:43:40.953]  This is a John McCain-Joseph Lieberman bill.
[00:43:40.973 --> 00:43:44.937]  It says, the Enemy Belligerent Interrogation, Detention and Prosecution Act of 2010.
[00:43:46.738 --> 00:43:51.300]  Allows the holding of citizens inside the United States for any reason.
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:44:02.503]  Section 5, any matters as the President considers appropriate with no evidence of any crime being committed extrajudicially by the military.
[00:44:02.743 --> 00:44:12.647]  And then now Homeland Security's put out a training video of these mobile Homeland Security body scanning vans that will also brain scan you and then they will claim with their quackery
[00:44:13.447 --> 00:44:14.168]  Well, it's because they're broke.
[00:44:14.188 --> 00:44:17.350]  The easiest way to make money in the world is in the prison business.
[00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:20.232]  And we know that the prison business in the U.S.
[00:44:41.514 --> 00:44:42.134]  It's thriving.
[00:44:42.154 --> 00:44:42.514]  The U.S.
[00:44:42.534 --> 00:44:44.475]  has the biggest prison population in the world.
[00:44:44.555 --> 00:44:45.095]  It's growing.
[00:44:45.215 --> 00:44:49.757]  The fastest minority in the United States in terms of growth is the prison population.
[00:44:50.017 --> 00:44:55.219]  We know that the private companies that own the prisons, they own the restaurants and the hotels that are located near the prisons.
[00:44:55.299 --> 00:45:01.581]  So when you go to visit your family in prison and you stay in the hotel and you eat in the restaurants, you're paying the same owner who owns the prison.
[00:45:01.861 --> 00:45:06.183]  We know that the prison owners lobby Washington to get laws passed to make it easier to put people into prison.
[00:45:06.929 --> 00:45:08.590]  And this is a huge moneymaker.
[00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:10.071]  It's the easy way to make money.
[00:45:10.652 --> 00:45:16.456]  In the United States, unfortunately, they don't have enough self-confidence anymore to compete and do things like
[00:45:17.099 --> 00:45:17.479]  I think so.
[00:45:39.753 --> 00:45:53.945]  Look, you know, the cutting edge of a technological revolution based on the fact that everybody wanted to be an astronaut, you know, and people wanted to get their science degrees, and America was competitive, and we were going to beat the Russians with Sputnik, and it was a very competitive society.
[00:45:54.205 --> 00:45:56.967]  But now, America's lost its will to compete.
[00:45:57.488 --> 00:46:04.734]  So they basically, all they want to do is build prisons and lock people up for money because they're broke, and they don't know how to pay up too much debt.
[00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:09.152]  You see, America is like the student with too much debt who gives up.
[00:46:09.592 --> 00:46:11.953]  Or the unemployed guy with too much debt who gives up.
[00:46:12.233 --> 00:46:13.593]  The entire country is like this.
[00:46:13.673 --> 00:46:14.494]  They have too much debt.
[00:46:14.714 --> 00:46:20.816]  So instead of trying to compete or to get a job and to compete on the world stage, they've given up.
[00:46:21.296 --> 00:46:22.557]  America has given up on itself.
[00:46:22.657 --> 00:46:26.178]  It doesn't have enough confidence to really want to compete on the world stage anymore.
[00:46:26.198 --> 00:46:27.459]  They're letting China and India.
[00:46:28.314 --> 00:46:31.015]  And these other countries take center stage.
[00:46:31.395 --> 00:46:32.916]  But that was the globalist plan.
[00:46:32.936 --> 00:46:34.117]  I read that from documents in the 70s.
[00:46:34.137 --> 00:46:35.477]  Move everything to China.
[00:46:35.818 --> 00:46:36.598]  Get us in debt.
[00:46:36.638 --> 00:46:38.019]  Turn us into a prison colony.
[00:46:38.419 --> 00:46:39.659]  Implode out our economy.
[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:43.021]  And all we'll provide is propaganda and military hardware.
[00:46:43.801 --> 00:46:48.604]  Max, let's look at the IMF's suggest how to raise climate change funds.
[00:46:48.964 --> 00:46:50.524]  This is really just their global tax.
[00:46:51.205 --> 00:46:53.486]  But how would private bankers sell a global tax?
[00:46:53.686 --> 00:46:55.047]  Oh, to save the penguins.
[00:46:55.647 --> 00:46:57.708]  And then we'll talk about where Max Keiser sees this going.
[00:47:00.066 --> 00:47:03.229]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:11.478]  I designed our top-selling holster, the Super Tuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched and gouged while carrying concealed.
[00:47:11.638 --> 00:47:16.763]  The Super Tuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.
[00:47:16.963 --> 00:47:19.846]  We offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.

[00:47:46.508 --> 00:47:51.311]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[00:47:54.312 --> 00:47:56.273]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:47:59.995 --> 00:48:03.637]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:48:03.997 --> 00:48:07.018]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:48:07.238 --> 00:48:08.659]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:48:09.358 --> 00:48:12.039]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:48:12.059 --> 00:48:18.260]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:23.441]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:48:23.601 --> 00:48:33.603]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:48:33.723 --> 00:48:35.824]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:48:36.064 --> 00:48:37.405]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:48:37.645 --> 00:48:39.927]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:48:40.107 --> 00:48:41.968]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:48:42.228 --> 00:48:47.031]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:48:47.392 --> 00:48:56.497]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:48:59.204 --> 00:49:00.044]  Gold isn't for you?
[00:49:00.225 --> 00:49:05.567]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[00:49:05.767 --> 00:49:06.188]  I get it.
[00:49:06.308 --> 00:49:15.672]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[00:49:15.932 --> 00:49:17.073]  That's not what's happening.
[00:49:17.333 --> 00:49:25.581]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[00:49:25.801 --> 00:49:29.084]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[00:49:29.204 --> 00:49:33.268]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[00:49:33.468 --> 00:49:35.049]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[00:49:35.069 --> 00:49:38.312]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[00:49:39.033 --> 00:49:42.636]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[00:49:42.836 --> 00:49:43.556]  You should, too.
[00:49:43.737 --> 00:49:44.717]  Find out what they know.
[00:49:44.877 --> 00:49:47.779]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[00:49:47.799 --> 00:49:47.839]  800-686-2237.
[00:49:47.859 --> 00:49:47.899]  800-686-2237.
[00:49:47.919 --> 00:49:48.499]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:49:48.539 --> 00:49:51.441]  As the economy continues to decline, patriots across the nation are preparing for the worst.
[00:49:51.461 --> 00:49:52.421]  The world is changing fast.
[00:49:52.461 --> 00:49:53.342]  Are you fully prepared?
[00:50:11.994 --> 00:50:14.697]  Or will you be forced to eat government soup?
[00:50:15.198 --> 00:50:25.468]  At patriotfood.com, we offer you 135 pounds of dehydrated food and six varieties of canned meat for half price.
[00:50:25.929 --> 00:50:29.473]  And at survivalistseeds.com, we now offer
[00:50:30.589 --> 00:50:36.594]  50 non-GMO varieties of vegetables and over 10,000 heirloom seeds.
[00:50:37.255 --> 00:50:41.538]  That's twice as many as our competition for the same price.
[00:50:42.118 --> 00:50:46.422]  Patriotfood.com and survivalistseeds.com.
[00:50:46.742 --> 00:50:49.104]  Food insurance, just in case.
[00:50:49.664 --> 00:50:54.308]  Owned by me, Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:07.173]  Associated Press, today IMF suggests how to raise climate change funds.
[00:51:07.734 --> 00:51:23.789]  The head of the International Monetary Fund, Director Dominic Strauss-Kahn, says that nations should have a quota system based on their GDP, paid directly to the IMF and World Bank to save the Earth from climate change.
[00:51:25.086 --> 00:51:27.968]  And then they admit where the money goes and what they do with it will be secret.
[00:51:27.988 --> 00:51:29.729]  It has nothing to do with it.
[00:51:29.749 --> 00:51:32.871]  They couldn't get Congress to pass the bill, so they're just doing it.
[00:51:32.931 --> 00:51:34.572]  This is what they said at the end of Copenhagen.
[00:51:35.852 --> 00:51:38.834]  What's the thinking of these people globally, Max Keiser?
[00:51:38.874 --> 00:51:51.902]  Because the money isn't there, the people are going bankrupt, the unemployment's over 20-plus percent, and all these counties and cities and states are passing laws to tax food, Europe's passing more taxes.
[00:51:53.903 --> 00:51:58.806]  They're bringing in unlimited amounts of immigrants who then weigh down the welfare system.
[00:51:58.826 --> 00:52:01.027]  I mean, the banks want to bankrupt things.
[00:52:02.288 --> 00:52:04.149]  Well, they're looking for a new bubble.
[00:52:04.849 --> 00:52:09.151]  And they were able to turn real estate into a wildly successful bubble.
[00:52:09.331 --> 00:52:18.977]  That was after the Nasdaq bubble, which was after the long-term capital management bubble and the savings and loan crisis bubble.
[00:52:19.497 --> 00:52:21.778]  So they need to create, they need to find a new bubble.
[00:52:21.858 --> 00:52:23.319]  Carbon trading, they hope,
[00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:24.500]  We're good to go.
[00:52:42.743 --> 00:52:56.621]  And that's because the theory is that if you create a $100 billion and $200 billion and a multi-trillion dollar derivatives bubble based on this new carbon-based asset, then it'll be a trickle-down economy and it'll be back to the way it was in 2005 and 2006.
[00:52:57.041 --> 00:52:58.584]  All we need is another huge bubble.
[00:52:59.405 --> 00:53:00.326]  But in my opinion,
[00:53:00.854 --> 00:53:14.803]  The next big bubble to come down the pike is something that nobody's talking about right now, and it's going to be what we're seeing over there at Cantor Fitzgerald and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, headed up by Gary Gensler, who's a former Goldman Sachs guy.
[00:53:14.823 --> 00:53:17.325]  He's over there at Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
[00:53:17.585 --> 00:53:22.749]  They're going to authorize, starting next month, trading in box office futures contracts.
[00:53:23.129 --> 00:53:28.813]  And in my opinion, this has the potential to be the next huge bubble and bust.
[00:53:29.221 --> 00:53:30.282]  In the American economy.
[00:53:30.462 --> 00:53:33.984]  And we are unique in that we're going to see the creation of a bubble.
[00:53:34.024 --> 00:53:37.826]  It's like looking through the Hubble telescope and seeing the creation of a faraway galaxy.
[00:53:38.226 --> 00:53:45.830]  Here we're going to watch a bubble go from zero to 500 billion dollars and then back to zero again in the course of 24 months.
[00:53:46.914 --> 00:53:51.559]  And this is going to be heralded as an amazing saving grace for the American economy.
[00:53:51.759 --> 00:53:59.988]  They're going to take box office receipts, which are roughly $10 to $15 billion a year, whether you look at it domestically or worldwide,
[00:54:00.728 --> 00:54:10.713]  They're going to securitize that, and they're going to introduce hundreds of billions of dollars of box office collateralized futures contracts, and this is going to be made available to millions of investors all over the world.
[00:54:10.753 --> 00:54:17.156]  And the bankers are going to make money on the way up, and then when it all goes bankrupt, they'll make money on a Hollywood bailout.
[00:54:18.396 --> 00:54:22.798]  Well, this is multidimensional, because first of all, there's three major pieces to this.
[00:54:22.878 --> 00:54:26.800]  First of all, this is an insider trader's paradise.
[00:54:27.338 --> 00:54:36.244]  This is a gangster's paradise being overseen by Gary Gensler, chairman of the CFTC.
[00:54:36.264 --> 00:54:49.192]  I reached out to them to try to warn them about what was going on here, but this is a former Goldman Sachs guy, he's been put in place by the banking cartel, and they're going to oversee with Cantor Fitzgerald this enormous, enormous
[00:54:49.708 --> 00:54:50.569]  A catastrophe.
[00:54:50.809 --> 00:54:56.133]  The insider trading possibilities are really unbelievable, like nothing we've seen before.
[00:54:56.473 --> 00:55:00.797]  Now we'll see films that they short where they'll sabotage the release.
[00:55:01.917 --> 00:55:03.258]  Well, that's the beginning of it.
[00:55:03.338 --> 00:55:05.480]  So let's say you've got two movies opening in two years.
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:08.703]  You know, Indiana Jones, the sequel, Spider-Man, the sequel.
[00:55:09.463 --> 00:55:13.466]  There's going to be... The news, the global news, treats this as real news.
[00:55:13.506 --> 00:55:16.188]  You know, the Hollywood news is covered before world news.
[00:55:16.569 --> 00:55:18.370]  The Hollywood news, it's the global current.
[00:55:19.148 --> 00:55:27.873]  And this is covered, you know, before, you know, earthquakes in foreign countries, before people declare war, they tell you what Angeli, Jolie and Brad Pitt are doing.
[00:55:27.893 --> 00:55:30.454]  You know, this is the most important thing for most people.
[00:55:30.495 --> 00:55:34.177]  This is the basis of why this is going to be a huge, spectacular bubble.
[00:55:34.557 --> 00:55:35.777]  So they're going to be, of course,
[00:55:37.066 --> 00:55:41.589]  ...shorting each other's projects in the market to sabotage each other's projects.
[00:55:41.609 --> 00:55:42.669]  That's one aspect to it.
[00:55:42.989 --> 00:55:47.552]  But also, we know that they're going to be colluding with each other, just like Goldman and JP Morgan.
[00:55:47.812 --> 00:55:50.814]  And these guys collude now in the derivatives business.
[00:55:51.114 --> 00:55:53.255]  They're going to be colluding in these box office futures contracts.
[00:55:53.275 --> 00:55:58.838]  And then when it totally implodes, the banks will fully control an industry they already dominated.
[00:55:58.918 --> 00:56:04.441]  And they'll be able to politicize it even more, because now there'll be all these city and county and state money invested.
[00:56:06.522 --> 00:56:16.308]  Well, the thing about a con game, the way a con works, Alex, is the con has to want to be conned.
[00:56:16.568 --> 00:56:21.011]  You know, we've all seen the scenes of con men working their trade.
[00:56:21.613 --> 00:56:29.778]  When these box office features contracts are released to the public, people are going to be tripping over themselves to get involved in this new business.
[00:56:30.058 --> 00:56:32.919]  Because everybody wants a piece of the celebrity Hollywood Bowl.
[00:56:32.979 --> 00:56:33.540]  Exactly!
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:36.581]  They'll say, I'm involved in the new Brad Pitt movie.
[00:56:36.882 --> 00:56:38.543]  Stay there, let's explain how the con works.
[00:56:38.863 --> 00:56:43.305]  Then they'll balloon it up, and then implode it, and it just continues.
[00:56:43.345 --> 00:56:47.748]  We have a Goldman Sachs guy setting up the grease collapse, now running the grease collapse.
[00:56:48.755 --> 00:56:51.738]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:56:52.678 --> 00:56:55.441]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:58.383 --> 00:57:01.126]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.

[00:57:22.062 --> 00:57:24.024]  That's buy three, get one free.

[00:58:03.555 --> 00:58:06.297]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:58:06.317 --> 00:58:10.639]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:16.082]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.

[00:59:02.507 --> 00:59:06.609]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:59:06.849 --> 00:59:12.253]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:12.613 --> 00:59:13.053]  It's true.
[00:59:13.353 --> 00:59:14.434]  Total government control
[00:59:14.514 --> 00:59:15.034]  We're good to go!

[00:59:54.463 --> 01:00:05.832]  We're gonna take some calls from Max Keiser, get into other subjects that he thinks is important on his radar.
[01:00:13.311 --> 01:00:13.791]  Busted!
[01:00:13.871 --> 01:00:18.955]  Citigroup caught blatantly marketing itself as a casino, exactly what Congress has been talking about for years.
[01:00:19.316 --> 01:00:21.097]  Here's another PrisonPlanet.com article.
[01:00:21.257 --> 01:00:24.580]  IMF head calls for huge global warming slush fund.
[01:00:26.281 --> 01:00:30.984]  It's like buying indulgences 600 years ago from the Vatican to get your family out of hell.
[01:00:31.465 --> 01:00:32.786]  It has nothing to do with the environment.
[01:00:33.848 --> 01:00:37.872]  That they use the money to go in and buy off third world and first world countries and buy up our infrastructure.
[01:00:38.392 --> 01:00:42.155]  You pay them tax money so they can come buy up your roads and put toll roads on it.
[01:00:42.796 --> 01:00:47.360]  And then if you go bankrupt and can't pay to go on it, they put you in jail in one of their private prisons they own.
[01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:49.021]  I mean, the sky's the limit.
[01:00:49.041 --> 01:00:50.703]  We're going back to Max Keiser in just a moment.

[01:02:29.199 --> 01:02:30.280]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:32.561]  You'll never stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:02:32.581 --> 01:02:32.621]  800-409-5633.
[01:02:32.641 --> 01:02:32.681]  800-409-5633.
[01:02:32.741 --> 01:02:33.321]  Or eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:02:33.361 --> 01:02:33.761]  And they've got
[01:02:39.204 --> 01:02:43.407]  Right, well, for the con to work, the person has to want to be conned, basically.
[01:03:07.122 --> 01:03:14.588]  In this case, you're conning them with the come-on with Hollywood, by turning Hollywood into a Ponzi scheme that anybody can lose money on.
[01:03:15.009 --> 01:03:21.554]  But beyond that, there's another piece to this, which is the technology itself, the virtual specialist technology that I invented back in 1996.
[01:03:21.755 --> 01:03:34.926]  This technology, effectively, it was invented when I put it together to eliminate all of the front-running abuse that I saw on the floor of the Stock Exchange when I was working as a stockbroker.
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:51.830]  So it's designed to eliminate what's called a broker-dealer conflict of interest, because anyone who's buying and selling stocks professionally on the floor of the exchange, they act as both a broker, matching buyers themselves, but they also act as a principal in buying and selling for their own account.
[01:03:52.090 --> 01:03:54.852]  My technology eliminates that conflict of interest.
[01:03:54.912 --> 01:03:56.033]  It eliminates front-running.
[01:03:56.313 --> 01:03:59.095]  It eliminates what we call now high-frequency trading.
[01:03:59.495 --> 01:04:02.437]  That technology, that patent, is being warehoused.
[01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:03.371]  I don't know.
[01:04:22.168 --> 01:04:40.201]  So cancer is effectively warehousing a technology that could save Americans hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars, that are lost by abuse on the floor of the exchange by these banks engaging in front-line... Instead it's come out that the big banks have special government-developed programs that allow them to actually cheat the market.
[01:04:41.708 --> 01:04:54.098]  These technologies, the high frequency trading as revealed when they captured one of the defectors from Goldman Sachs a few months ago, they set up shop on the floor of the exchange and they siphon off billions of dollars.
[01:04:54.158 --> 01:04:55.460]  Goldman says they make $100 million a day.
[01:04:58.319 --> 01:04:59.359]  We're good to go.
[01:05:16.124 --> 01:05:16.504]  Max Keiser.
[01:05:32.927 --> 01:05:33.987]  Where does it end?
[01:05:34.147 --> 01:05:37.588]  Because we are seeing people say no in Greece, but it doesn't matter.
[01:05:37.648 --> 01:05:39.188]  Goldman set it up ten years ago.
[01:05:39.528 --> 01:05:45.709]  They're now running, as you know, but listeners may not, the bankruptcy there at the government level.
[01:05:45.729 --> 01:05:47.049]  They've paid off the politicians.
[01:05:47.850 --> 01:05:55.511]  Everywhere you look, it's Goldman Sachs piloting the fraud, and the other big banks nexusing in with them, help fund them and carry it out with them.
[01:05:56.491 --> 01:06:01.972]  But Iceland voters, and we have one of the leaders of the parliament, Jóns Dóttir, joining us tomorrow.
[01:06:03.618 --> 01:06:07.281]  They used anti-terror laws, as you know, but listeners may have missed it.
[01:06:07.301 --> 01:06:13.847]  In fact, there's a headline, UK anti-terror laws right move against Icelandic banks.
[01:06:14.407 --> 01:06:24.215]  That's out of a British newspaper, where they're even seizing citizens' money, saying, well, your government owes us this money ten times the entire GDP of the nation.
[01:06:24.255 --> 01:06:27.398]  And now that they've said no, the banks are going, guess what?
[01:06:27.478 --> 01:06:30.380]  We actually owned assets in your country already that'll pay this off.
[01:06:31.161 --> 01:06:32.122]  Okay, that's fine.
[01:06:32.863 --> 01:06:34.806]  But they're still going to try some other chicanery.
[01:06:34.826 --> 01:06:48.344]  I mean, explain how Goldman Sachs, allied with the other big brokerage banks, takes down nations, and now we've got top politicians in the U.S., the leader of the Democrats in the Senate, saying the same thing's going to happen here, but saying
[01:06:48.644 --> 01:06:58.749]  We've got to do whatever the banks say in the next financial terrorism, or we'll have a depression, but we know we're getting a depression by letting them continue to ripe us, and we've seen all the headlines.
[01:06:58.769 --> 01:07:05.292]  I've heard Bloomberg Financial, I listen every day, with the bankers bragging, look how we got more power out of our last scam!
[01:07:05.492 --> 01:07:06.613]  Let's go even bigger!
[01:07:06.633 --> 01:07:08.414]  You know, the world is ours!
[01:07:08.454 --> 01:07:10.175]  I mean, it's just, it's so transparent.
[01:07:11.315 --> 01:07:13.416]  Well, Iceland is pushing back.
[01:07:13.436 --> 01:07:16.738]  You know, you saw that story that Iceland is going to introduce, they're trying to work
[01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:19.910]  It's called the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative.
[01:07:47.947 --> 01:07:48.287]  That's right.
[01:07:48.487 --> 01:07:51.168]  They want to come out of this as a shining example.
[01:07:51.928 --> 01:07:55.349]  Not only to the banking fraudsters, but to all the media that supports the bank fraud.
[01:07:55.409 --> 01:07:58.369]  How do you see the jackals that John Perkins talks about?
[01:07:59.129 --> 01:08:01.970]  What do you think black ops are going to do to try to stop this?
[01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:10.752]  Because one example of people standing up, you know, if one ant stands up, they could all stand up, and those little puny ants outnumber us a thousand to one.
[01:08:11.496 --> 01:08:15.739]  Well, that's why the people of Greece need to get involved with the people of Iceland.
[01:08:15.759 --> 01:08:19.703]  That's why when you're talking on your show about the different groups in the U.S.
[01:08:19.943 --> 01:08:26.728]  that are struggling to emerge from this new post-credit crisis suppression.
[01:08:26.948 --> 01:08:28.189]  And we're all being demonized.
[01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:29.911]  We're all being demonized as terrorists.
[01:08:30.271 --> 01:08:34.194]  They have common cause with the people in Iceland, the people in Greece, and people all over the world.
[01:08:34.214 --> 01:08:35.215]  This is a global
[01:08:35.768 --> 01:08:41.790]  So when you add the global dimension, you're not talking about, oh, a few hundred thousand or a few million in the U.S.
[01:08:42.010 --> 01:08:44.131]  who are struggling against their oppressors.
[01:08:44.151 --> 01:08:49.253]  You're talking about millions all over the world who are struggling against basically the same group of bankers.
[01:08:49.633 --> 01:08:52.715]  Goldman Sachs is at the center of everything.
[01:08:52.735 --> 01:08:55.116]  They were in the center of the Greece problem.
[01:08:55.376 --> 01:08:57.717]  The New York Post just talked about it in 2005.
[01:08:57.757 --> 01:08:58.617]  They were behind a deal to
[01:09:01.218 --> 01:09:01.799]  We're good to go.
[01:09:25.798 --> 01:09:36.720]  Of those at the center of the problem, you're telling me that millions around the world can't figure out a way to decapitalize just one or two of the worst of the worst?
[01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:37.701]  I mean, come on now.
[01:09:38.261 --> 01:09:43.362]  Let me expand on that, but I want to ask you where you... I mean, were you dropped on your head as a kid?
[01:09:43.642 --> 01:09:44.982]  I mean, are you mentally impaired?
[01:09:45.302 --> 01:09:48.403]  I mean, not you, Alex Jones, but I mean, anybody listening to this show... No, I understand.
[01:09:49.565 --> 01:09:50.385]  I mean, what's the problem?
[01:09:50.685 --> 01:09:52.446]  But Max, that's what I'm trying to ask you.
[01:09:53.646 --> 01:09:54.787]  That's what I'm trying to ask you.
[01:09:54.807 --> 01:09:58.288]  I was listening to Bloomberg Financial Saturday night.
[01:09:58.928 --> 01:10:02.570]  I was on with Geraldo and I was driving home for 30 minutes listening to it.
[01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:10.212]  They had a former Goldman Sachs CEO on bragging that, well, the reason we're do so good is we have our people all over government.
[01:10:10.732 --> 01:10:14.794]  I mean, they know they are a lawless mafia pirate group.
[01:10:16.274 --> 01:10:29.624]  You know, I remember in New York City, where I lived for many years, you had a guy named Don Gotti, the dapper Don, who was very blatant, walking around town in his $2,000 suit, you know, bragging about his criminality.
[01:10:29.944 --> 01:10:35.228]  Now you've got Lloyd Blankfein, who goes on TV bragging about his criminality, because they know they can get away with impunity.
[01:10:37.256 --> 01:10:39.758]  It doesn't mean they're doing anything less criminal.
[01:10:40.078 --> 01:10:43.521]  It's just that there's no regulations in place right now at the moment.
[01:10:44.022 --> 01:10:47.745]  The only way to get after these guys is you've got to attack it like a racket.
[01:10:48.005 --> 01:10:50.187]  You have to bring in anti-racketeering laws.
[01:10:50.227 --> 01:10:52.489]  But they control Northcom.
[01:10:52.509 --> 01:10:54.230]  They control Homeland Security.
[01:10:54.631 --> 01:10:56.753]  They control the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:10:57.073 --> 01:11:00.336]  And they're demonizing anyone that criticizes them.
[01:11:00.596 --> 01:11:02.197]  But I don't see it working this time.
[01:11:02.237 --> 01:11:04.099]  I mean, why are they so arrogant?
[01:11:04.139 --> 01:11:05.240]  I mean, I've never seen
[01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:10.104]  And we've interviewed all these different financial experts, university professors, former federal regulators.
[01:11:10.464 --> 01:11:13.927]  They say there's never been fraud at anywhere near this magnitude.
[01:11:13.967 --> 01:11:15.949]  They cover it in all the republic that you appear in.
[01:11:16.249 --> 01:11:18.051]  I mean, why?
[01:11:18.231 --> 01:11:19.572]  Why do they think they're invincible?
[01:11:21.334 --> 01:11:24.016]  Well, you know, this is the ego.
[01:11:24.176 --> 01:11:28.861]  I worked on Wall Street, and it's very typical to find people who have a God complex.
[01:11:29.421 --> 01:11:31.062]  Because, and especially after 9-11,
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:43.744]  There's this notion that they attacked the people on Wall Street, and for them to come back and re-establish their business, they were doing something more than just shuffling lots of paper and stealing money.
[01:11:43.784 --> 01:11:47.965]  They were now fighting some epic clash of civilizations.
[01:11:48.065 --> 01:11:51.867]  So they got into their head that they're doing something cosmically important.
[01:11:52.327 --> 01:11:57.949]  And once you get, you know, you inhale the sniff of this God complex, it's very intoxicating.
[01:11:58.356 --> 01:12:09.082]  So the people, this is why they keep referring to themselves as God, because they really believe that they're doing something extraordinarily important for the benefit of humanity as a whole.
[01:12:10.003 --> 01:12:11.664]  This is part of the propaganda model.
[01:12:11.684 --> 01:12:26.652]  You have to really believe you're God to put your head at the pillow at night and ignore the fact that you're impoverishing millions of people, and in countries around the world you're causing mass starvation and colonization and massive problems.
[01:12:27.059 --> 01:12:31.672]  So they have this incredible God complex, and it goes right into the White House.
[01:12:31.913 --> 01:12:34.200]  The problem in the White House is of course you've got basically
[01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:39.472]  The way, like Barack Obama, for example, the way he attacks healthcare is he looks at the healthcare stocks.
[01:12:39.933 --> 01:12:42.274]  If they're going up, he says he thinks he's doing a good job.
[01:12:42.814 --> 01:12:45.095]  If they're going down, he thinks he's doing a bad job.
[01:12:45.395 --> 01:12:46.296]  He's a day trader.
[01:12:46.536 --> 01:12:47.836]  Barack Obama is a day trader.
[01:12:47.877 --> 01:12:53.839]  He looks at all the America's policies in front of him and he trades them, like a day trader who's just trading stocks all day.
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:56.441]  He has absolutely no idea he's a servant of the people.
[01:12:56.481 --> 01:12:57.861]  He doesn't have any idea what that means.
[01:12:59.222 --> 01:13:01.724]  He's just basically nickel and diming.
[01:13:01.764 --> 01:13:04.826]  He's trying to end the day with a few more bucks than he started with.
[01:13:05.446 --> 01:13:09.069]  Max, I want to go to Kohl's, but how do you see this ending?
[01:13:09.149 --> 01:13:12.111]  Not how you wish it would end, but trending outwards.
[01:13:12.591 --> 01:13:14.352]  We do see a lot of resistance forming.
[01:13:14.732 --> 01:13:17.854]  We see the bankers like Marie Antoinette saying, let them eat cake.
[01:13:18.815 --> 01:13:20.416]  How do you see this unfolding?
[01:13:21.296 --> 01:13:25.039]  You and I end up doing wildly popular cooking shows.
[01:13:28.749 --> 01:13:32.755]  We're gonna be on the Food Channel, and it's gonna be Alex and Max cooking chili.
[01:13:33.447 --> 01:13:35.648]  You know, and it's going to be, it's all going to be over.
[01:13:35.688 --> 01:13:37.649]  We're going to be, let's make a chili.
[01:13:37.709 --> 01:13:39.390]  It's called the America Chili.
[01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:43.032]  Hey, remember when America existed back in a few years ago?
[01:13:43.052 --> 01:13:46.113]  I'll be like, yeah, it was a great country back then, wasn't it?
[01:13:46.133 --> 01:13:47.974]  Yeah, put a little bit more chili powder in the chili.
[01:13:48.294 --> 01:13:53.957]  Yeah, by the way, after this show, the Chinese will be coming on, the new owners of America, and they'll be making some nice Chinese food.
[01:13:54.217 --> 01:13:58.039]  Stay tuned for the next show, Buy America, Post America, New China Land.
[01:13:58.099 --> 01:13:58.479]  Bye!
[01:13:59.199 --> 01:14:01.800]  Well, that really is it, but that's the bigger David Rockefeller plan.
[01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:03.140]  There's a method to this madness.
[01:14:03.501 --> 01:14:17.165]  They said in the 70s they would bankrupt us and move everything to China, and now China says they're the king daddy and the police don't care as long as they can taser somebody, and I guess we just fall into a big pile is what you're saying?
[01:14:18.285 --> 01:14:25.548]  Well, clearly on the money front, I mean, China has the ability to dictate policy in America because every time
[01:14:26.332 --> 01:14:27.093]  I think so.
[01:14:33.908 --> 01:14:34.529]  The U.S.
[01:14:34.569 --> 01:14:37.191]  sovereignty, again, it's all about market trading.
[01:14:37.611 --> 01:14:39.913]  And China owns an extraordinary amount of U.S.
[01:14:39.933 --> 01:14:40.153]  dollars.
[01:14:40.193 --> 01:14:43.516]  And I've never seen, Max, such saber-rattling.
[01:14:44.177 --> 01:14:49.121]  There are governments openly saying they're going to start dumping the dollar, that we're now an enemy.
[01:14:49.722 --> 01:14:53.585]  I've got the articles here today that we're no longer on good stead with the U.S.
[01:14:54.125 --> 01:14:55.727]  Why is China saying all this?
[01:14:57.816 --> 01:15:06.164]  Well, because they want to now let the world know that they're in charge and that people should not be doing deals with the U.S.
[01:15:06.785 --> 01:15:08.687]  Russia shouldn't be doing deals with the U.S.
[01:15:08.847 --> 01:15:13.152]  Iran, of course, they're doing deals with Iran even though America is saber-rattling with Iran.
[01:15:13.732 --> 01:15:16.333]  They want to let the world know that they're open for business.
[01:15:16.473 --> 01:15:18.895]  All over Africa, they're buying strategic assets.
[01:15:18.915 --> 01:15:20.635]  They're buying oil-related assets.
[01:15:20.676 --> 01:15:24.858]  But China wants to let the world know that, listen, don't believe that malarkey coming out of the U.S.
[01:15:24.898 --> 01:15:26.538]  that they're still in control.
[01:15:26.598 --> 01:15:27.419]  We're in control.
[01:15:27.439 --> 01:15:28.339]  We're doing deals.
[01:15:28.379 --> 01:15:29.260]  We've got lots of money.
[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:30.420]  We're open for business.
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.261]  They have to get that message out.
[01:15:32.761 --> 01:15:41.686]  And that's why every time they get a chance, whether it's to go up against Google or go up against whomever, they want to let the world know that they're open for business.
[01:15:42.206 --> 01:15:46.168]  And for the world to focus their attention on what's possible now in China.
[01:15:47.129 --> 01:15:55.113]  And they also, on every front, say no to the UN.
[01:15:55.133 --> 01:15:57.194]  They're saying no to the carbon taxes.
[01:15:58.114 --> 01:16:07.559]  They're saying no to all of this and saying, you Americans go ahead and raise carbon taxes and then your banks are going to invest your money with us.
[01:16:07.619 --> 01:16:08.360]  Go ahead, idiots.
[01:16:10.015 --> 01:16:27.693]  China's not spending 50% of any of the, you know, in the U.S., they spend 50% of tax revenue, $1.5 trillion, on defense, to fight wars that are completely obsolete, because now we know that the World War III is going to be fought in the currency pit.
[01:16:27.773 --> 01:16:29.595]  It's going to be currency against currency.
[01:16:29.876 --> 01:16:31.097]  No one's going to defend tanks.
[01:16:31.570 --> 01:16:34.551]  You know, China doesn't need to send tanks to California.
[01:16:34.791 --> 01:16:35.792]  They're just going to dump U.S.
[01:16:35.832 --> 01:16:36.372]  Treasury bonds.
[01:16:36.392 --> 01:16:42.075]  They're not going to waste money buying, you know, infrastructure, except military infrastructure, unless it makes good TV shows.
[01:16:42.135 --> 01:16:44.776]  No, they're actually building a real infrastructure.
[01:16:45.216 --> 01:16:47.077]  They're actually building a real infrastructure.
[01:16:48.177 --> 01:16:54.620]  And instead, our infrastructure is body scanners, checkpoints, pot-bellied cops with machine guns.
[01:16:56.377 --> 01:16:56.897]  The U.S.
[01:16:56.937 --> 01:17:00.259]  just put its first high-speed train in California.
[01:17:01.259 --> 01:17:06.562]  China, I think, already has enough high-speed train track to go from New York to L.A.
[01:17:06.642 --> 01:17:07.062]  or something.
[01:17:07.082 --> 01:17:08.103]  It's something extraordinary.
[01:17:08.123 --> 01:17:10.884]  They're putting in high-speed train tracks.
[01:17:11.264 --> 01:17:14.546]  But clearly, they're in control.
[01:17:15.046 --> 01:17:18.728]  The solutions for the U.S.
[01:17:18.788 --> 01:17:20.309]  are not hard to figure out.
[01:17:20.834 --> 01:17:29.843]  But the problem is you've got this incredible bottleneck because you've got the banks and the politicians that have fused together to create this enormous hurdle.
[01:17:30.223 --> 01:17:39.873]  Well, the other big problem, Max, we're going to break, come back with some calls, is the Pentagon says, well, we're going to expand worldwide, but even if we implode, we'll make the American people our enemy.
[01:17:40.513 --> 01:17:43.655]  You just might be only a few meals away from anarchy.
[01:17:43.675 --> 01:17:45.757]  Look at the recent world events and even the economic crisis.
[01:17:46.077 --> 01:17:48.919]  The time to prepare yourself and your family is now.
[01:18:10.753 --> 01:18:11.873]  For one week only.

[01:19:03.769 --> 01:19:06.774]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:19:07.014 --> 01:19:08.417]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:19:09.139 --> 01:19:11.780]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:18.002]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:19:18.182 --> 01:19:23.204]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:19:23.744 --> 01:19:33.367]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:19:33.487 --> 01:19:35.588]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:19:35.828 --> 01:19:37.169]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:19:37.429 --> 01:19:39.690]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:19:39.870 --> 01:19:41.731]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:19:42.012 --> 01:19:46.814]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:19:58.283 --> 01:20:01.465]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:20:01.826 --> 01:20:03.667]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:20:04.107 --> 01:20:04.547]  Don't!
[01:20:04.988 --> 01:20:08.010]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.

[01:20:45.479 --> 01:20:45.759]  Call 888-352-7726.
[01:20:49.902 --> 01:20:50.242]  That's 888-352-7726.
[01:20:50.262 --> 01:20:50.302]  888-352-7726.
[01:21:13.479 --> 01:21:15.280]  We are taking your phone calls now.
[01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:16.700]  It's simple.
[01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:19.041]  Either the big central banks go or we go.
[01:21:19.621 --> 01:21:23.663]  They openly say they're setting up world government, they're going to run our lives, cut off our resources.
[01:21:24.243 --> 01:21:35.748]  It's a total nightmare and I'm just here covering it and I've got every major newspaper and government operation demonizing the hell out of me right now because we are effective and they know that we know they're criminals.
[01:21:37.028 --> 01:21:41.330]  And coming up next hour I'm going to get into all the news that I haven't even covered yet.
[01:21:41.410 --> 01:21:42.951]  It's just unspeakably insane.
[01:21:44.687 --> 01:21:46.068]  Let's go to Melissa in Mass.
[01:21:46.108 --> 01:21:47.148]  You're on with Max Keiser.
[01:21:47.168 --> 01:21:47.548]  Go ahead.
[01:21:48.469 --> 01:21:49.049]  Hi Alex.
[01:21:49.089 --> 01:21:49.489]  Hi Max.
[01:21:49.509 --> 01:21:50.950]  Thank you so much for taking my call.
[01:21:51.610 --> 01:21:53.371]  I have two really quick things to know.
[01:21:53.751 --> 01:21:55.072]  I used to work at TD Bank.
[01:21:55.172 --> 01:21:56.833]  I worked there for four years.
[01:21:57.473 --> 01:22:06.978]  And one thing is that they utilize a website blocker that's intended to be used for employees so they don't look at sexually vulgar or sexually explicit websites.
[01:22:07.298 --> 01:22:11.700]  They block both InfoWars and Prison Planet and list it for militant behavior.
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:13.060]  So I thought that was interesting.
[01:22:13.121 --> 01:22:13.981]  I thought that you should know that.
[01:22:14.577 --> 01:22:22.169]  Second thing, this new overdraft fee revenue law that's going into effect July 1st, is there a bottom line there that we're not seeing?
[01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:24.393]  I know how important overdraft fees are to the big banks.
[01:22:24.943 --> 01:22:27.245]  Yeah, this is a question that I'd throw in for Max.
[01:22:27.585 --> 01:22:32.910]  They're announcing that they may not insure your money markets.
[01:22:33.290 --> 01:22:35.712]  They're announcing they may keep your money for seven days.
[01:22:36.152 --> 01:22:39.015]  They're openly talking about dollar devaluations.
[01:22:39.355 --> 01:22:44.019]  They're openly saying they may take people's pension funds and the government will then give you part of it back.
[01:22:44.359 --> 01:22:45.020]  Max Keiser.
[01:22:46.281 --> 01:22:50.825]  Yeah, well, just every week we get more information that's pointing into
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:53.981]  It's pointing in the same direction, isn't it?
[01:22:54.021 --> 01:22:55.462]  The banks, they're out of money.
[01:22:55.482 --> 01:22:56.182]  They don't have any money.
[01:22:56.322 --> 01:22:57.022]  They want your money.
[01:22:57.363 --> 01:23:01.985]  They're setting it up now so they can make it easy to freeze your account.
[01:23:02.005 --> 01:23:03.806]  You don't have access to your account or whatever.
[01:23:03.866 --> 01:23:05.006]  I mean, they're broke.
[01:23:05.206 --> 01:23:08.828]  They're sitting on hundreds and billions of losses that they have not yet disclosed.
[01:23:09.088 --> 01:23:10.889]  There's another second leg.
[01:23:11.411 --> 01:23:16.254]  And they think Northcom, just like they're doing in Greece, will allow them to take everybody's money?
[01:23:38.815 --> 01:23:44.280]  And they're using this propaganda model that we're God, and we need to fight the bad guys, and if you resist, you're a scapegoat.
[01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:46.041]  You know, talk about Citibank.
[01:23:46.061 --> 01:23:51.926]  Citibank last week, it was disclosed that this group, it's a new group called Fabulous.
[01:23:52.327 --> 01:23:53.748]  It serves the gay community.
[01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:56.812]  The Citigroup said, we don't like your material, we're going to freeze your account.
[01:23:57.092 --> 01:23:59.073]  So here they're scapegoating the gay community.
[01:23:59.113 --> 01:24:00.174]  When did we see that last?
[01:24:00.334 --> 01:24:02.456]  Oh, the 1930s in Nazi Germany?
[01:24:02.516 --> 01:24:12.783]  And again, they pick a group they think is unpopular with most people to set the precedent, like, oh, we're just going to secretly arrest Americans that are Muslims, and now they've got a bill for everybody.
[01:24:14.204 --> 01:24:17.986]  It's classic scapegoating, you know, 101, scapegoating 101.
[01:24:19.187 --> 01:24:19.968]  Thank you, Melissa.
[01:24:20.008 --> 01:24:21.789]  Pastor in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:24:22.009 --> 01:24:23.330]  Let me just add something to that.
[01:24:23.703 --> 01:24:27.869]  You know, you remember in America we had the Jim Crow laws, which were discriminatory laws?
[01:24:28.670 --> 01:24:28.770]  Yes.
[01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:32.715]  You know, and some people could only use this, you know, it's the colored-only bathroom, right?
[01:24:33.316 --> 01:24:36.781]  Colored-only sections in the restaurant, sit at the back of the bus.
[01:24:37.181 --> 01:24:39.144]  Well, the same thing is being applied to interest rates.
[01:24:39.528 --> 01:24:44.690]  If you're Goldman, you get to borrow money at 1% and get a free rate of return at 17%.
[01:24:45.510 --> 01:24:51.151]  If you're everybody else, you have to borrow money at 17%, and the most you'll ever get on that is 1% on your money.
[01:24:51.271 --> 01:24:52.512]  Well, that's like the EU!
[01:24:52.852 --> 01:24:54.832]  It's a Jim Crow law using interest rates.
[01:24:54.852 --> 01:24:57.653]  They're discriminating against anyone who's not a Goldman Sachs employee.
[01:24:57.913 --> 01:24:58.934]  Get at the back of the bus!
[01:24:59.354 --> 01:24:59.874]  And shut up!
[01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:05.604]  Well, in the EU, the bureaucrats have a 17% income tax and everybody else has a 50%.
[01:25:07.126 --> 01:25:09.608]  And it's the same thing expanding on every level.
[01:25:10.129 --> 01:25:12.551]  Now they have these Homeland Security no-fly lists.
[01:25:12.611 --> 01:25:13.752]  It'll be no work list.
[01:25:14.052 --> 01:25:17.396]  And they just magically put whoever they want on it with no evidence.
[01:25:17.456 --> 01:25:23.862]  I mean, it's just a... But don't worry, we'll arrest some college students that threw some cotton balls out on the ground.
[01:25:24.042 --> 01:25:25.624]  That means black people pick cotton.
[01:25:27.639 --> 01:25:32.200]  We'll arrest them for terrorism, but then we'll abort 52% of the black people.
[01:25:33.421 --> 01:25:34.241]  Max Keiser, stay there.
[01:25:34.261 --> 01:25:36.001]  Let's jam in a few calls in the next five minutes.
[01:25:36.041 --> 01:25:36.982]  Back in 70 seconds.
[01:25:40.082 --> 01:25:43.443]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:25:55.083 --> 01:25:56.324]  No, this isn't science fiction.

[01:26:53.732 --> 01:26:56.494]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:03.703 --> 01:27:05.084]  All right, we're into the final hour.
[01:27:05.764 --> 01:27:13.227]  I'm not going to take any more calls until the very end of the show if I have time, because I've got a lot of news and information that must be covered.
[01:27:14.367 --> 01:27:15.548]  Max Keiser is our guest.
[01:27:15.608 --> 01:27:17.028]  Let's go to Pastor in Ohio.
[01:27:17.109 --> 01:27:18.269]  Quickly, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:27:19.109 --> 01:27:23.671]  Yeah, Alex, I've talked to you before, and I wanted to share something with you and Max.
[01:27:24.231 --> 01:27:30.174]  You know, one thing I noticed every time you guys come on, I mean, it's fantastic.
[01:27:30.454 --> 01:27:32.755]  You guys have the news right up front.
[01:27:33.533 --> 01:27:38.475]  And I want to thank you for that, because you allow us to share that with other people.
[01:27:40.156 --> 01:27:42.537]  And I do that with my congregation.
[01:27:42.557 --> 01:27:44.118]  Well, we're all in this together, buddy.
[01:27:44.558 --> 01:27:45.358]  Yes, sir, we are.
[01:27:45.818 --> 01:27:48.960]  And I'll tell you what, you know, one thing I noticed
[01:27:50.211 --> 01:27:52.172]  I noticed the different things that you're saying.
[01:27:52.612 --> 01:27:54.373]  Trust me, Alex, you are not alone.
[01:27:54.613 --> 01:28:05.698]  Even though you may not hear and know the people that are standing with you, you guys that are getting the news out there to us because you guys have the resources and we don't.
[01:28:05.718 --> 01:28:06.938]  Well, Pastor, let me be clear.
[01:28:07.098 --> 01:28:10.059]  I know the world's on fire with people waking up.
[01:28:10.119 --> 01:28:10.980]  Max knows that.
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:16.102]  I just can't believe people aren't even waking up faster because it's so outrageous.
[01:28:16.122 --> 01:28:17.242]  But I appreciate your call.
[01:28:18.743 --> 01:28:21.425]  I mean, Max, you see the huge awakening, don't you?
[01:28:22.666 --> 01:28:40.317]  Well, I'm curious to see exactly how the huge awakening will happen, what form it'll take, because, you know, in the 60s, we had a huge awakening, and it took the form of a musical revolution and a social revolution, and then basically society went back to sleep.
[01:28:40.337 --> 01:28:41.758]  You know, here's something very interesting.
[01:28:41.798 --> 01:28:47.221]  I see in Berkeley, California, the students now are protesting against these rise in rates
[01:28:47.714 --> 01:28:49.775]  Which, of course, is great that they're protesting that.
[01:28:49.956 --> 01:29:00.923]  But where were the students two years ago when they were all supporting the Iraq War invasion, and they were all tattletaling on their professors who were against the Iraq War invasion?
[01:29:01.284 --> 01:29:07.948]  Remember that, two or three years ago, when professors said, well, all the money that was spent in Iraq, they don't have any money for education.
[01:29:08.208 --> 01:29:10.350]  Now they're protesting because they don't have money for education.
[01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:11.110]  Well, tough luck!
[01:29:11.331 --> 01:29:15.954]  You should have been against the Iraq War two or three years ago, and now you have money for education!
[01:29:16.482 --> 01:29:18.004]  Let's talk to Petunia in Texas.
[01:29:18.044 --> 01:29:19.606]  Petunia, you're on the air with Max Keiser.
[01:29:20.768 --> 01:29:21.529]  Hi, thank you.
[01:29:21.549 --> 01:29:22.330]  Thank you for taking the call.
[01:29:23.192 --> 01:29:30.041]  Just very quickly, I think that one of the things that we need to do is to bring a third party, like the Constitution Party of Texas.
[01:29:30.121 --> 01:29:32.545]  We're trying to get ballot access right now.
[01:29:33.274 --> 01:29:34.435]  And it's not easy.
[01:29:34.555 --> 01:29:39.177]  You know, the two big parties, the Republicans and the Democrats, have a little monopoly going on.
[01:29:39.778 --> 01:29:46.481]  Well, the public better get out there and realize that we do need to take our states back against this takeover, and it needs to be done now.
[01:29:46.501 --> 01:29:47.722]  Do you have a question for Max Keiser?
[01:29:49.423 --> 01:29:51.564]  Well, um... You don't?
[01:29:51.624 --> 01:29:52.405]  I appreciate your call.
[01:29:52.465 --> 01:29:53.605]  I gotta let you go, okay?
[01:29:53.665 --> 01:29:54.126]  I told you.
[01:29:54.146 --> 01:29:55.546]  These are calls for Max Keiser.
[01:29:55.566 --> 01:29:56.927]  You can call back another time on that.
[01:29:57.247 --> 01:29:58.628]  Mike in Louisiana, you're on the air.
[01:29:58.648 --> 01:29:59.028]  Go ahead.
[01:30:03.928 --> 01:30:19.476]  I, in all the polls, when it comes to 9-11, it seems like there's an overwhelming majority of the public on these polls that want a new investigation or otherwise don't believe the government.
[01:30:19.496 --> 01:30:22.178]  Yeah, and the media says we're terrorists, the majority of America.
[01:30:22.698 --> 01:30:25.360]  Here's my question.
[01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:27.741]  Why don't, why is there a candidate
[01:30:28.410 --> 01:30:34.194]  That is reading these polls and running on a 9-11 investigation platform.
[01:30:34.294 --> 01:30:35.255]  Right, right question.
[01:30:35.836 --> 01:30:37.237]  Gotta get that to Max Keiser.
[01:30:37.297 --> 01:30:37.617]  Max?
[01:30:38.718 --> 01:30:40.899]  Well, apparently New Hampshire is going for it.
[01:30:40.979 --> 01:30:44.662]  New Hampshire is now going to do a full scale and they're going to put something on the ballot.
[01:30:44.902 --> 01:30:48.165]  They're going to do a non-binding look into this event.
[01:30:48.825 --> 01:30:52.628]  And so there are pockets, you know, states are picking up the ball.
[01:30:53.390 --> 01:31:05.416]  That's right, they've got what, now it's a majority of their towns signing on, because in New Hampshire they have right to revolt, right to revolt laws, where they can force it onto the ballot, and at the statehouse if the towns want it.
[01:31:05.456 --> 01:31:10.458]  Yeah, now let's say if I'm in America, I would say, you know what, I think I'll move to New Hampshire.
[01:31:10.478 --> 01:31:13.379]  Let New Hampshire reap the benefit of wanting to pursue this.
[01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:15.540]  And move to New Hampshire, boost their economy.
[01:31:15.641 --> 01:31:16.641]  Get a job in New Hampshire.
[01:31:16.761 --> 01:31:19.422]  Make New Hampshire, you know, the new California.
[01:31:19.602 --> 01:31:21.663]  Because they're not afraid to look at stuff.
[01:31:21.944 --> 01:31:22.704]  Go to New Hampshire!
[01:31:23.837 --> 01:31:25.459]  Well, in closing, Max, well said.
[01:31:25.479 --> 01:31:28.802]  I'm glad you brought that up, because I mentioned it last week, but it hardly talked about it.
[01:31:28.822 --> 01:31:30.244]  I want to get some people on from New Hampshire.
[01:31:30.264 --> 01:31:30.985]  They're leading this.
[01:31:31.485 --> 01:31:35.009]  That's why the system is demonizing 9-11 Truth 24-7 now.
[01:31:35.349 --> 01:31:36.671]  They're scared of something.
[01:31:37.312 --> 01:31:39.975]  And they know the majority of America's questioning the official story.
[01:31:40.015 --> 01:31:43.759]  Max, thank you for spending so much time with us today.
[01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:45.641]  Anytime, Alex.

[01:33:58.387 --> 01:34:03.730]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:34:04.991 --> 01:34:09.753]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:34:10.134 --> 01:34:16.937]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:34:18.858 --> 01:34:21.000]  They sew pride in every stitch.

[01:34:31.942 --> 01:34:35.124]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[01:34:35.764 --> 01:34:36.585]  Others don't.
[01:34:37.005 --> 01:34:38.906]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:34:39.146 --> 01:34:40.667]  Diamond gusset jeans.

[01:34:55.516 --> 01:34:56.397]  Others don't.
[01:34:59.017 --> 01:35:01.178]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:35:01.759 --> 01:35:04.620]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:35:06.241 --> 01:35:12.245]  Depending on the poll, more than half of Americans believe 9-11, the official story, to be a fraud.
[01:35:12.265 --> 01:35:15.566]  The lowest polls that are scientific are 36%.
[01:35:15.646 --> 01:35:25.172]  Some scientific polls, like the Angus and Reed New York Times poll of 2006, show 84% question the official story and believe they're being lied to.
[01:35:26.496 --> 01:35:28.338]  You're not a terrorist if you question.
[01:35:28.358 --> 01:35:31.100]  9-11 Truth had never been engaged in any violence.
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:38.005]  In the last two years I've seen mainstream media talking points that 9-11 Truth is going to attack the government.
[01:35:39.346 --> 01:35:41.869]  That has now happened last Thursday.
[01:35:42.674 --> 01:35:50.822]  And Fox News had me on Saturday night, Geraldo Rivera, to officially come out and say, this has destroyed your movement.
[01:35:51.302 --> 01:35:54.585]  No, physics and reality and science hasn't done that.
[01:35:54.985 --> 01:36:02.572]  We expose your false flag terror, and you're not going to be able to stop the truth from coming out, no matter how much terrorism you stage.
[01:36:04.113 --> 01:36:13.537]  And we're gonna have Webster Tarpley on today in the last 20 minutes to break down the history as a historian of confirmed Patsy's.
[01:36:13.577 --> 01:36:14.397]  We've got him, correct?
[01:36:14.758 --> 01:36:15.998]  I just saw you thumbs up.
[01:36:17.119 --> 01:36:17.679]  Correct, Jaren?
[01:36:22.621 --> 01:36:23.281]  Yeah, he's confirmed.
[01:36:23.801 --> 01:36:24.041]  Great.
[01:36:24.902 --> 01:36:26.782]  Okay, so that is coming up.
[01:36:27.423 --> 01:36:28.243]  Here's an article.
[01:36:28.263 --> 01:36:31.764]  12 New England towns demand 911 investigation.
[01:36:34.679 --> 01:36:35.579]  Reinvestigation.
[01:36:35.619 --> 01:36:38.041]  A new movement to reinstate the 9-11 attacks.
[01:36:38.841 --> 01:36:42.623]  A new movement to reinvestigate the 9-11 attacks is gaining pace in the U.S.
[01:36:42.883 --> 01:36:44.203]  with major public support.
[01:36:44.283 --> 01:36:49.826]  Twelve towns are set to decide whether to ask the federal government for a new independent probe.
[01:36:50.306 --> 01:36:58.150]  Because in New Hampshire, they can have the cities basically order the legislature what to do.
[01:36:59.645 --> 01:37:08.208]  New York is dubbed as the Empire State for its wealth and resources and is rightfully regarded as America's most famous city, a beacon of fashion, finance, and fast-paced action.
[01:37:08.588 --> 01:37:16.070]  New Hampshire is the granite state for so-called self-sufficiency, less flash, and cash, more famous for hosting the first U.S.
[01:37:16.431 --> 01:37:17.451]  presidential primary.
[01:37:18.872 --> 01:37:24.018]  And it continues, they're talking about all the cities that are moving for a new investigation.
[01:37:24.538 --> 01:37:30.585]  This is why the system is so concerned and trying to demonize 9-11 Truth.
[01:37:31.526 --> 01:37:32.467]  It's asinine.
[01:37:32.487 --> 01:37:38.012]  9-11 Truth, exposing government-sponsored terrorism, and then the government tries to say, we are terrorists.
[01:37:38.593 --> 01:37:39.294]  It's not going to work.
[01:37:40.913 --> 01:37:45.735]  But they're also demonizing the Tea Parties, the In-the-Fed-ers, the Birthers, everybody else.
[01:37:45.775 --> 01:37:52.837]  We're being told we're terrorists, we're going to commit terror attacks by the Southern Poverty Law Center and others that are spokesmen for the government.
[01:37:53.538 --> 01:37:59.560]  And just like Hitler would stage terror attacks to demonize his political enemies, the same thing is being set up.
[01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:01.701]  And I've been predicting it intensely.
[01:38:02.521 --> 01:38:10.066]  In the last, really, year, but the last three months, intensely, warning every day, and now you're seeing clear false flags.
[01:38:10.086 --> 01:38:16.391]  So, Webster, coming on, the last 20 minutes to walk through all of this with us.
[01:38:18.172 --> 01:38:19.994]  And we have a bunch of guests joining us tomorrow.
[01:38:20.034 --> 01:38:23.196]  Believe me, you're not going to want to miss that information.
[01:38:26.229 --> 01:38:41.523]  Now, yesterday I started getting calls saying Adam Gadon, the grandson of the ADL founding board member, a guy who was arrested for beating up Arabs outside their mosque in California, a guy who was so hateful of Arabs and Islam, he couldn't control himself.
[01:38:41.783 --> 01:38:43.204]  He then went and grew a big beard.
[01:38:44.045 --> 01:39:03.434]  And he sits there in English saying he's a top Al-Qaeda commander and then Wired Magazine reported that videos of him and others that have been uploaded by different government front groups put the Al-Qaeda lower third and logo up in the same video layer as the Intel Center and other groups that upload these.
[01:39:05.295 --> 01:39:09.057]  There have been fake Bin Laden videos, fake Al-Qaeda videos, all confirmed.
[01:39:10.424 --> 01:39:11.744]  They announced they'd arrested him.
[01:39:12.285 --> 01:39:14.245]  Everybody was like, oh, Adam Gadahn must be real!
[01:39:15.746 --> 01:39:17.066]  And I said, folks, watch.
[01:39:17.086 --> 01:39:22.067]  They'll say they didn't arrest him or they arrested him as an intelligence operative and they're protecting him.
[01:39:22.307 --> 01:39:27.669]  I've seen other arrests of high-level al-Qaeda, and you'll hear a year later, two years later in some cases, oh, they were really U.S.
[01:39:27.709 --> 01:39:28.269]  government agents.
[01:39:28.289 --> 01:39:30.250]  This will be in the news, but buried in a footnote.
[01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:34.811]  And they quietly released them under a new name and a witness protection program.
[01:39:36.311 --> 01:39:36.651]  Okay?
[01:39:37.632 --> 01:39:38.292]  That goes on.
[01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:45.083]  When they executed Tim McVeigh, two different mainline news reporters reported he was breathing.
[01:39:47.212 --> 01:39:56.394]  And it came out in federal documents that the Southern Poverty Law Center was running the Elohim City white supremacist compound that McVeigh was at.
[01:39:57.214 --> 01:40:00.134]  And it was sworn in federal documents by Terry Nichols and others.
[01:40:00.495 --> 01:40:06.276]  And then later the lawyers involved actually got the FBI declassified, but the FBI blacked out part of it.
[01:40:06.616 --> 01:40:11.297]  Then they got another four-year request through federal court where they blacked out other areas.
[01:40:11.337 --> 01:40:13.377]  They could put the two together and have the full report.
[01:40:13.837 --> 01:40:14.297]  FULL.
[01:40:14.858 --> 01:40:15.378]  FEDERAL.
[01:40:15.899 --> 01:40:16.619]  OPERATION.
[01:40:16.879 --> 01:40:21.963]  You had a bunch of states, what was it, 14 at the time, moving to declare 10th Amendment sovereignty against the feds, the U.N.
[01:40:21.983 --> 01:40:24.085]  takeover of Bill Clinton, the sellout to the Chinese.
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:29.742]  A move to get us out of the United Nations, and boom, they blew that building up.
[01:40:29.762 --> 01:40:43.212]  It came out on CBS News that the ATF had been told not to be in the building that day, that the FBI was in the town running an operation, and it came out that McVeigh was hired in black ops to infiltrate militia and terror groups.
[01:40:43.652 --> 01:40:45.533]  That is confirmed.
[01:40:46.539 --> 01:40:56.486]  And it's confirmed in the New York Times and CBS News again that the FBI cooked the bomb, trained the drivers, totally set up these two mentally retarded dupes in 1993 for the World Trade Center attack.
[01:40:57.106 --> 01:41:03.830]  The Ahmad Salam intelligence agent from Egypt thought they were setting him up, recorded the FBI telling him, you let that bombing go ahead.
[01:41:03.850 --> 01:41:06.792]  And that's the only reason he got away without being arrested.
[01:41:06.992 --> 01:41:08.874]  And he was given a $1,300,000 payoff to keep quiet after that happened.
[01:41:12.779 --> 01:41:17.004]  They declassified in the last year those audiotapes from that trial.
[01:41:17.785 --> 01:41:21.649]  Burmas has clips of it in the upcoming film, Invisible Empire, by the way.
[01:41:22.150 --> 01:41:25.834]  I mean, this is some damning, damning information.
[01:41:26.275 --> 01:41:27.936]  We have Operation Northwoods, the U.S.
[01:41:27.956 --> 01:41:29.658]  government staged terror attack documents.
[01:41:29.698 --> 01:41:33.202]  It was declassified three weeks ago at the State Department.
[01:41:34.764 --> 01:41:37.466]  That Bobby Kennedy wanted to blow up U.S.
[01:41:37.526 --> 01:41:43.290]  embassies in Latin America to invade Honduras and other countries, and his brother said no?
[01:41:43.310 --> 01:41:48.113]  I mean, this is just standard operating procedure!
[01:41:49.094 --> 01:41:57.420]  And for the media to say, these crazy, nut, lunatics think we should look at the government at least allowing this to happen, when you have the hijackers trained at U.S.
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:41:58.220]  military bases.
[01:41:58.761 --> 01:42:03.304]  I mean, these are facts that cannot be ignored any longer.
[01:42:05.154 --> 01:42:08.442]  Now, I want to get into the most important story of the day.
[01:42:09.905 --> 01:42:12.932]  I want to play a video clip coming up when we come out of the next segment.
[01:42:18.001 --> 01:42:25.229]  The federal government under Tom Ridge in 2003 admitted that the airport security you see will be nationwide.
[01:42:25.529 --> 01:42:38.003]  They're now putting out homeland security videos showing mobile trucks where they're going to body scan you, brain scan you, the machine supposedly tells if you're lying, to get into football games at highway checkpoints.
[01:42:38.684 --> 01:42:48.588]  No judge, no jury, no nothing, and of course the machine's a quack fraud, just like lie detectors were proven to be a fraud in millions of people that were sent to prison, hundreds of thousands who were innocent.
[01:42:48.948 --> 01:42:49.749]  It's just made up.
[01:42:50.369 --> 01:42:52.430]  Oh, but the machine says you're lying.
[01:42:52.450 --> 01:42:56.512]  We're going to show you some Homeland Security video of that coming up.
[01:42:58.272 --> 01:43:06.096]  But the bigger issue here for everyone to understand, and for everyone to be clear about,
[01:43:07.074 --> 01:43:22.888]  Is that Section 802 of the USA Patriot Act states that all misdemeanors are acts of terrorism and last week we read articles where it's being used against homeless, gun shops, people that supposedly don't pay their income taxes, no due process, they're being arrested under the Patriot Act.
[01:43:24.093 --> 01:43:30.516]  John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 states the Feds are here and NORTHCOM are here to take over the states.
[01:43:30.916 --> 01:43:33.237]  The MIAC Homeland Security documents of last year.
[01:43:33.597 --> 01:43:35.298]  Internal documents law enforcement gave us.
[01:43:35.338 --> 01:43:36.659]  Mainstream media confirmed they were real.
[01:43:36.979 --> 01:43:43.542]  Says gun owners, veterans, returning veterans, returning gun owner veterans, libertarians, Ron Paul supporters, in the Fedders.
[01:43:44.583 --> 01:43:47.364]  Tax protesters are what Homeland Security is really for.
[01:43:47.664 --> 01:43:51.646]  It's not for the radical Arabs that the CIA runs nine times out of ten.
[01:43:55.376 --> 01:44:00.258]  And now they admit with this Adam Gadahn that he wasn't arrested, it was all fake as usual.
[01:44:01.398 --> 01:44:01.678]  Again.
[01:44:03.339 --> 01:44:07.120]  They tell you they arrest him, then they tell you hours later they didn't in a bottom footnote.
[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:11.602]  That's how stupid they think you are to lend credibility to this Adam Gadahn guy.
[01:44:11.802 --> 01:44:15.743]  And when he's making videos again in a month, the media won't retract that he was never arrested.
[01:44:16.023 --> 01:44:18.044]  This is PSYOP mind control.
[01:44:19.704 --> 01:44:22.106]  Dissenters to be detained as enemy belligerents.
[01:44:22.146 --> 01:44:23.727]  This isn't just PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:44:23.967 --> 01:44:25.769]  This is Atlantic Monthly.
[01:44:31.253 --> 01:44:34.056]  Dissenters to be detained as enemy belligerents.
[01:44:34.496 --> 01:44:35.697]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:44:36.097 --> 01:44:48.687]  Since the establishment media is convinced that the Tea Party members, 9-11 Truthers, Libertarians, Ron Paul supporters, and basically anyone with a dissenting political opinion is a likely domestic terrorist, they should be celebrating the fact that a new bill
[01:44:49.648 --> 01:44:50.389]  We're good to go.
[01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:27.212]  Interrogation, Detention, and Prosecution Act of 2010 introduced by Senators John McCain and Joseph Lieberman on Thursday with a little fanfare sets out a comprehensive policy for detention, interrogation, and trial of suspected enemy belligerents who are believed to engage in hostile activities
[01:45:27.953 --> 01:45:40.747]  Against the United States by belligerence who are believed to have engaged and it goes on requiring these individuals to be held in military custody Interrogated for their intelligence value and not provided with Miranda warning rights the Atlantic's mark
[01:45:42.415 --> 01:45:42.935]  Ambinder.
[01:45:43.675 --> 01:45:45.216]  Read the full text of the bill here.
[01:45:45.456 --> 01:45:45.996]  PDF.
[01:45:46.536 --> 01:45:48.096]  The bill does not distinguish between U.S.
[01:45:48.136 --> 01:45:55.958]  citizens and non-citizens and states that suspected belligerents who were considered a high-value detainee shall not be provided with Miranda warning.
[01:45:56.618 --> 01:46:00.919]  A person considered a high-value detainee if they fulfill one of the following criteria.
[01:46:00.959 --> 01:46:01.460]  Here's the key.
[01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:06.681]  One, pose a threat of an attack on civilian or civilian facilities in the U.S.
[01:46:06.961 --> 01:46:07.381]  or U.S.
[01:46:07.401 --> 01:46:08.361]  facilities abroad.
[01:46:08.521 --> 01:46:10.102]  Two, poses a threat to U.S.
[01:46:10.122 --> 01:46:11.262]  military personnel or U.S.
[01:46:11.282 --> 01:46:11.622]  military
[01:46:12.182 --> 01:46:12.622]  Facilities.
[01:46:12.662 --> 01:46:12.942]  Three.
[01:46:13.343 --> 01:46:14.843]  Potential intelligence value.
[01:46:14.923 --> 01:46:16.944]  For any reason, any potential value, they grab you.
[01:46:17.184 --> 01:46:17.444]  Four.
[01:46:17.864 --> 01:46:20.445]  Is a member of Al-Qaeda or a terrorist group affiliated with Al-Qaeda.
[01:46:20.465 --> 01:46:21.006]  And here's the key.
[01:46:21.046 --> 01:46:21.366]  Five.
[01:46:22.206 --> 01:46:26.128]  Such other matters as the President considers appropriate.
[01:46:26.508 --> 01:46:27.808]  The President is the Fuhrer.
[01:46:27.848 --> 01:46:28.448]  He is God.
[01:46:30.789 --> 01:46:34.731]  And they go on to say this will be used against the American people and that's how it's written.
[01:46:36.932 --> 01:46:43.536]  And now they say they already have Viper teams, TSA, Homeland Security, all over the country running checkpoints with regular Army and Marines.
[01:46:44.377 --> 01:46:52.582]  Now they're saying that they're just going to pull you out of your car when you're going to the mall and run you through these machines and, oh, where'd Alex go?
[01:46:52.922 --> 01:46:54.603]  Well, the machine said he was a terrorist.
[01:46:55.936 --> 01:46:56.876]  Total fraud.
[01:46:57.296 --> 01:46:58.737]  That machine is now your jury.
[01:46:59.057 --> 01:47:03.339]  Is garlic the absolute best defense against the threat of bacterial and viral pandemics?
[01:47:03.679 --> 01:47:03.879]  No.
[01:47:04.119 --> 01:47:06.960]  The answer is Ali C. From your alistore.com.
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:17.243]  Ali C. was developed by a British chemist who found a way to stabilize the allicin in garlic and incorporate it into his flagship product, Ali C. It's the strongest and safest antibiotic known to man.
[01:47:17.443 --> 01:47:19.024]  Ali C. makes garlic supplements
[01:47:22.526 --> 01:47:29.469]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:47:29.649 --> 01:47:34.051]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:47:34.211 --> 01:47:39.934]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[01:47:40.014 --> 01:47:43.416]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[01:48:00.528 --> 01:48:01.728]  Change is the buzzword.
[01:48:01.928 --> 01:48:04.110]  Politics are changing in the negative direction.
[01:48:04.330 --> 01:48:05.571]  How about positive change?
[01:48:05.970 --> 01:48:09.153]  Thousands of customers have experienced positive change.
[01:48:09.313 --> 01:48:10.394]  Yes, thousands.

[01:48:59.901 --> 01:49:03.566]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:49:03.927 --> 01:49:06.931]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:49:07.172 --> 01:49:08.594]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:49:09.272 --> 01:49:11.933]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:49:11.953 --> 01:49:18.155]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:49:18.335 --> 01:49:23.357]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:49:23.517 --> 01:49:33.521]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:49:33.641 --> 01:49:35.742]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:49:35.982 --> 01:49:37.302]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:49:37.562 --> 01:49:39.823]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:49:40.023 --> 01:49:41.884]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:49:42.144 --> 01:49:46.966]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:51:02.065 --> 01:51:03.966]  Webster Tarbley coming up in 15 minutes.
[01:51:05.727 --> 01:51:09.969]  To go over a brief history of previous Patsy's where it's confirmed to be government staged.
[01:51:11.689 --> 01:51:12.570]  This is what they do.
[01:51:14.966 --> 01:51:26.541]  So they've introduced a bill that has a good chance of passing that says American citizens for any potential intelligence value can be secretly arrested, tortured, or for such other matters as the President considers appropriate.
[01:51:27.042 --> 01:51:31.047]  Now the Enemy Combatant Act said the same thing, but this is even more expansive.
[01:51:32.208 --> 01:51:33.190]  Simultaneously,
[01:51:34.918 --> 01:51:43.463]  It's finally in Wired Magazine, and even the Wall Street Journal, headline, Cybersecurity, the End of the Free Internet.
[01:51:43.823 --> 01:51:47.905]  Another headline, Cybersecurity Enacts the End of the Open Internet.
[01:51:49.646 --> 01:51:51.107]  I mean, this is really happening.
[01:51:51.127 --> 01:51:52.748]  They're really saying the end of free speech.
[01:51:53.408 --> 01:51:55.149]  They're really saying we'll secretly arrest you.
[01:51:55.369 --> 01:52:00.132]  They really have legislation to publicly open the FEMA camps, the National Emergency Centers Act.
[01:52:01.192 --> 01:52:03.393]  They really have all these executive orders on the books.
[01:52:03.673 --> 01:52:05.653]  The foreign banks are really robbing us.
[01:52:06.414 --> 01:52:10.515]  Our criminal government does nothing but put dictatorships and corrupt regimes in worldwide.
[01:52:10.895 --> 01:52:12.755]  This isn't the American government.
[01:52:13.316 --> 01:52:17.677]  And a lot of people in government are concerned as well, but all of us have to have our voices heard.
[01:52:18.177 --> 01:52:20.678]  And stop just attacking the Republicans or the Democrats.
[01:52:20.718 --> 01:52:21.578]  They're a bunch of puppets.
[01:52:22.198 --> 01:52:23.819]  We have to go after the bankers.
[01:52:23.859 --> 01:52:24.259]  Now listen.
[01:52:25.819 --> 01:52:28.400]  License plate reading cameras are scanning everywhere you go.
[01:52:28.641 --> 01:52:29.981]  Your cell phones are tracking you.
[01:52:30.381 --> 01:52:36.985]  They admit that the federal government and Google, not just public schools, are watching you on the cameras and microphones built into all the new computers.
[01:52:37.265 --> 01:52:38.086]  That's now admitted.
[01:52:38.286 --> 01:52:39.807]  It's now admitted for 37 years.
[01:52:39.887 --> 01:52:41.567]  All babies at birth have their blood taken.
[01:52:41.788 --> 01:52:44.509]  It's given to the Pentagon for bioweapons research illegally.
[01:52:44.769 --> 01:52:46.210]  I told you that 14 years ago.
[01:52:46.430 --> 01:52:47.651]  It's now all over the news!
[01:52:48.991 --> 01:52:50.672]  See, they just do whatever they want.
[01:52:50.712 --> 01:52:54.973]  They put out fake al-Qaeda videos, they stage terror attacks, they're completely criminal.
[01:52:55.193 --> 01:52:58.415]  They stole $28 trillion and won't tell Congress where it went.
[01:52:58.435 --> 01:53:01.836]  $28 trillion, not $784 billion.
[01:53:04.872 --> 01:53:06.995]  Now I'm going to go out to break with part of this six-minute clip.
[01:53:07.055 --> 01:53:10.199]  It's in the article Paul Watson wrote to Senators to be detained as enemy belligerents.
[01:53:10.439 --> 01:53:14.825]  There's another Homeland Security thing they're looking at, another video, where they want everybody to wear taser bracelets.
[01:53:14.966 --> 01:53:16.167]  Everyone that gets on a plane.
[01:53:16.528 --> 01:53:18.150]  Funnily enough, the naked body records you.
[01:53:18.951 --> 01:53:19.712]  There's no end!
[01:53:19.752 --> 01:53:20.914]  This is pure tyranny!
[01:53:22.284 --> 01:53:32.452]  Now here they are in a Homeland Security video talking about these mobile vans they've got, these big mobile 18-wheeler trailers, where they body scan you, brain scan you, to see if you're lying.
[01:53:33.053 --> 01:53:35.795]  And these are now showing up in America.
[01:53:36.756 --> 01:53:43.001]  Think of a science fiction movie where there's mobile brain scanning vans, because there's terrorists, but they leave the borders wide open.
[01:53:43.441 --> 01:53:49.486]  And every time there's a real terrorist, and they're going to stop him, the State Department's ordered by the CIA to let the underwear bomber on the plane.
[01:53:49.746 --> 01:53:51.568]  It's mainstream news and gets no attention.
[01:53:52.168 --> 01:53:53.290]  Let's go ahead and go to this video.
[01:53:55.754 --> 01:53:57.236]  Oh, happy, calm music.
[01:53:57.256 --> 01:53:58.578]  Homeland Security.
[01:53:58.758 --> 01:53:59.880]  Notice how they do it real calm.
[01:54:00.241 --> 01:54:01.382]  Everything's fine, slaves.
[01:54:01.422 --> 01:54:02.204]  Get on the trains.
[01:54:02.544 --> 01:54:03.325]  Get on the wagons.
[01:54:05.669 --> 01:54:19.814]  Under the Future Attribute Screening Technologies, or FAST, program, the Department of Homeland Security is developing innovative physiological and behavioral screening technologies to streamline the screening process at security checkpoints.
[01:54:20.734 --> 01:54:23.615]  In support of this program, Battelle has partnered with... Head pause!
[01:54:24.730 --> 01:54:30.813]  See, first you take your shoes off, you get asked questions, you take your belt off, you get searched.
[01:54:31.513 --> 01:54:34.835]  They're admitting like dog training in the airport, then they do it nationwide.
[01:54:35.315 --> 01:54:43.759]  Then it's naked body scans, then they're talking about body x-rays, then it's brain scanners, it's being asked questions, it's being prodded, it's secret police everywhere.
[01:54:43.919 --> 01:54:46.980]  They're already doing this in England three years ago, they have mobile trucks doing it.
[01:54:47.521 --> 01:54:49.922]  Do you understand how evil this government is?
[01:54:51.311 --> 01:54:54.632]  See, they know most of you fly on planes and put up with this, so now they'll be on the streets.
[01:54:54.872 --> 01:55:00.274]  The schools have thumb scanners, body searches, brainwashing, shooting drills to scare the kids.
[01:55:00.935 --> 01:55:03.095]  They're conditioning you to be total slaves.
[01:55:03.135 --> 01:55:03.576]  Continue.
[01:55:04.016 --> 01:55:16.080]  Industry leaders, Farber Specialty Vehicles and Draper Laboratory to design and develop a portable research facility for the development and demonstration of innovative security screening technologies.
[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:18.321]  The Fast Demonstration Laboratory.
[01:55:19.648 --> 01:55:34.796]  The mobility of the FAST demonstration laboratory allows security officials to quickly and efficiently establish security boundaries at any location, making it useful for everything from large sporting events, border crossings, or airports.
[01:55:35.837 --> 01:55:42.180]  The screening mobile module provides a checkpoint to establish or supplement security facilities at points of entry.
[01:55:43.470 --> 01:55:47.255]  At special events, attendees pass through the screening mobile module.
[01:55:47.275 --> 01:55:47.956]  All right, pause.
[01:55:48.577 --> 01:55:54.304]  See, first they have troops out of the Kentucky Derby, football games, college, NFL, then high school.
[01:55:54.584 --> 01:55:55.806]  We showed you that five years ago.
[01:55:55.866 --> 01:55:59.691]  Little three-year-olds bags being searched by troops, being conditioned.
[01:56:00.592 --> 01:56:02.053]  You see video from Fallujah.
[01:56:02.074 --> 01:56:05.617]  They have these mobile trucks, face scanning, biometrically brain scanning.
[01:56:06.117 --> 01:56:17.168]  In 2000, I showed you Marine Corps training in California, where they had people playing the parts of American militia from San Francisco being herded through these systems.
[01:56:18.732 --> 01:56:21.676]  They're now getting grants to give these to local police departments?
[01:56:22.057 --> 01:56:30.849]  And the Homeland Security officials sit on the boards of these companies, getting money as consultants to then go illegally lobby for these?
[01:56:30.869 --> 01:56:34.454]  I mean, this is a high-tech, futuristic nightmare!
[01:56:35.421 --> 01:56:40.784]  We're gonna finish up with this, play the Fox News piece, hit peace with Geraldo, go to Webster Tarpley and a lot more.
[01:56:40.844 --> 01:56:48.307]  But, I mean, to openly introduce bills for FEMA camps and to arrest citizens for no reason and torture us, I mean, my God.
[01:56:48.828 --> 01:56:49.728]  We're on the march.
[01:56:50.228 --> 01:56:51.809]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:56:52.749 --> 01:56:55.431]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:56:59.409 --> 01:57:03.072]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:57:03.432 --> 01:57:06.435]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:57:06.675 --> 01:57:11.459]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:57:11.479 --> 01:57:17.704]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:57:17.864 --> 01:57:20.106]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:57:20.626 --> 01:57:20.926]  Tim Geithner?
[01:57:20.946 --> 01:57:21.367]  Bernanke?
[01:57:21.447 --> 01:57:22.227]  They're arsonists!
[01:57:22.247 --> 01:57:23.388]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:57:23.408 --> 01:57:25.650]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:57:39.540 --> 01:57:46.509]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:57:46.810 --> 01:57:55.942]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:57:59.892 --> 01:58:03.533]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:58:03.853 --> 01:58:11.974]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:58:12.714 --> 01:58:16.755]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:58:17.335 --> 01:58:28.177]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:58:28.797 --> 01:58:37.801]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:58:38.302 --> 01:58:43.364]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:58:43.744 --> 01:58:50.927]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.

[01:58:59.298 --> 01:59:05.623]  Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[01:59:05.983 --> 01:59:12.108]  Because alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:59:12.388 --> 01:59:18.393]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[01:59:18.733 --> 01:59:23.637]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[01:59:24.097 --> 01:59:31.945]  Using AlkaVision pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[01:59:32.285 --> 01:59:36.429]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to an alkaline level.
[01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:40.593]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[01:59:41.534 --> 01:59:47.076]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.
[01:59:47.276 --> 01:59:49.997]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com.
[01:59:50.317 --> 01:59:51.057]  Or by calling 269-409-1776.
[01:59:51.077 --> 01:59:51.417]  269-409-1776 today.
[01:59:51.437 --> 01:59:52.938]  I'm the voice inside your head.
[01:59:53.018 --> 01:59:53.878]  You refuse to hear.
[01:59:54.278 --> 01:59:55.818]  I'm the face that you hate.
[02:00:22.535 --> 02:00:24.396]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:26.298 --> 02:00:30.722]  So taser bracelets, mobile vans, forced inoculation.
[02:00:31.402 --> 02:00:33.845]  They set you down and ask you if you're a terrorist.
[02:00:34.485 --> 02:00:37.508]  And these people buy $500 football tickets.
[02:00:37.648 --> 02:00:38.549]  They're gonna go through it.
[02:00:38.569 --> 02:00:39.089]  They're gonna do it.
[02:00:39.129 --> 02:00:40.050]  Their kids are gonna do it.
[02:00:40.490 --> 02:00:40.991]  And it's just
[02:00:42.048 --> 02:00:55.194]  Total conditioning to accept people getting in your business, being guilty until proven innocent, and it's a machine scanning your facial expressions and your brainwaves.
[02:00:55.294 --> 02:00:56.695]  Already some airports have these.
[02:00:59.258 --> 02:01:01.660]  Now they want blood samples to get a driver's license.
[02:01:01.680 --> 02:01:04.821]  Bill Clinton signed an executive order in 1994 to do that.
[02:01:04.882 --> 02:01:08.564]  My first film, America Destroyed by Design, shows the executive order.
[02:01:09.184 --> 02:01:10.485]  Now they're trying to implement it.
[02:01:11.065 --> 02:01:14.547]  They're training you to accept anything, like a pimp breaks a whore.
[02:01:15.428 --> 02:01:15.808]  Okay?
[02:01:15.948 --> 02:01:17.369]  They're breaking your will.
[02:01:18.430 --> 02:01:23.033]  It's so sick to see my fellow countrymen and others globally being turned into nothing but slaves.
[02:01:24.313 --> 02:01:28.116]  Let's go ahead and finish up with this chilling clip from Homeland Security.
[02:01:29.110 --> 02:01:33.054]  The unique low-floor trailer design ensures accessibility for all.
[02:01:34.375 --> 02:01:43.423]  Inside the screening mobile module, a suite of real-time, non-invasive sensors measure behavioral and physiological indications of malintent.
[02:01:43.704 --> 02:01:44.665]  Oh, it's non-invasive!
[02:01:44.685 --> 02:01:45.405]  Back it up!
[02:01:46.106 --> 02:01:46.987]  It's non-invasive!
[02:01:47.027 --> 02:01:49.069]  We don't stick anything up your rear or down your throat!
[02:01:52.256 --> 02:02:01.644]  Brain scanning people, body scanning people, biometrically recording you at malls or on the highway or to go into a sporting event.
[02:02:02.264 --> 02:02:04.226]  And the public schools are already little prisons.
[02:02:04.886 --> 02:02:07.148]  But the illegal aliens in 800 cities are above the law.
[02:02:07.749 --> 02:02:12.172]  Every day they run into somebody and kill them in Central Texas and the media never talks about how they're illegal aliens.
[02:02:12.332 --> 02:02:15.555]  But they throw the book at us, the scumbag, dumb citizens.
[02:02:15.835 --> 02:02:16.596]  That's how we're seen.
[02:02:16.616 --> 02:02:17.837]  And I guess we deserve it.
[02:02:18.297 --> 02:02:18.918]  Back to the clip!
[02:02:38.735 --> 02:02:50.141]  The Screening Mobile Module can be configured to support primary screening, secondary screening, observation areas, or multiple screening lanes for higher subject throughput.
[02:02:51.622 --> 02:03:01.007]  Anchor track on the walls, ceiling, and floors provide a secure and easily reconfigurable means of installing equipment throughout the screening unit.
[02:03:01.988 --> 02:03:06.310]  New screening sensors can be easily integrated into the Screening Mobile Module.
[02:03:08.871 --> 02:03:15.595]  The command unit provides local supervision and management of screening operations during a security event.
[02:03:16.476 --> 02:03:30.625]  Multiple screening units can be wirelessly networked to a single command module, minimizing the resources needed to manage large events and providing a cost-effective means of providing on-site security operations at a large event.
[02:03:31.516 --> 02:03:39.759]  Climate-controlled data processing areas in both mobile modules provide ample space for on-site data processing and analysis equipment.
[02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:46.222]  The mobile modules are secured by a security system that protects the equipment and sensor data.
[02:03:46.802 --> 02:03:49.863]  These are mobile interrogation brainwashing units.
[02:03:50.264 --> 02:03:52.324]  Skip ahead to the very end because we're running out of time.
[02:03:53.265 --> 02:03:56.566]  At the very end they show actual subjects being asked if they're terrorists.
[02:03:57.687 --> 02:03:59.447]  Skip ahead the last minute or two shows it.
[02:04:00.588 --> 02:04:00.808]  I mean...
[02:04:03.567 --> 02:04:07.190]  They just engage in outrageous behavior in front of everyone.
[02:04:07.710 --> 02:04:08.271]  Did you find it?
[02:04:09.792 --> 02:04:10.132]  Go ahead.
[02:04:10.312 --> 02:04:12.634]  Developing innovative screening technologies.
[02:04:12.654 --> 02:04:15.457]  Now here's some examples.
[02:04:15.797 --> 02:04:18.599]  Step forward and stand on those footprints on that map.
[02:04:18.959 --> 02:04:19.840]  Step forward.
[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:24.164]  What I want to have you do is can you put your purse in your pocket or just to the side there?
[02:04:25.171 --> 02:04:26.532]  I'm going to have you look in my direction.
[02:04:26.913 --> 02:04:32.978]  Just keep your hands to the side and try and refrain from movement.
[02:04:33.018 --> 02:04:35.139]  Just try and remain as still as possible.
[02:04:35.219 --> 02:04:43.586]  Did you show your ID to the first guard?
[02:04:48.511 --> 02:04:52.034]  Are you attempting to smuggle an explosive device into the expo today?
[02:04:57.313 --> 02:04:58.515]  Are you from the local area?
[02:04:58.535 --> 02:05:04.825]  Yes.
[02:05:04.845 --> 02:05:08.090]  Are you attempting to smuggle a recording device into the expo today?
[02:05:09.993 --> 02:05:10.634]  Uh, that's enough.
[02:05:11.682 --> 02:05:13.083]  And then notice they widen it.
[02:05:13.203 --> 02:05:15.984]  Oh, you're going to the expo center to see a rock and roll concert.
[02:05:16.384 --> 02:05:18.846]  Are you attempting to smuggle a recording device?
[02:05:18.866 --> 02:05:20.366]  Because that's the same as an explosive.
[02:05:20.386 --> 02:05:22.888]  See, first, are you trying to smuggle an explosive in?
[02:05:23.708 --> 02:05:24.949]  Are you from the local area?
[02:05:25.469 --> 02:05:27.570]  Are you trying to smuggle a recording device in?
[02:05:28.070 --> 02:05:29.831]  See, because they know there's no real terrorist.
[02:05:32.170 --> 02:05:33.951]  And so, and then they go on and on.
[02:05:34.191 --> 02:05:43.295]  And when I watch the Marines playing the part of taking over Oakland, interrogating the mock terrorist, you're in a militia, where are you from?
[02:05:43.355 --> 02:05:44.376]  Where'd you get the helmet?
[02:05:45.076 --> 02:05:46.677]  And they're doing the same thing.
[02:05:47.537 --> 02:05:55.501]  You live in Fallujah now, folks, and if you let these sickos, naked bodies scan you, you already let them take your shoes off and all these acts of submission.
[02:05:56.101 --> 02:06:02.622]  Now, in the last hour of flights, they say you can't talk, gotta put your hands in your lap, can't have a blanket, because you all might be terrorists.
[02:06:02.902 --> 02:06:18.986]  The only group we can trust that's not terrorists is the government, run by big banks, stealing tens of trillions of dollars, and lying about WMDs, and killing over a million Iraqis, and leaving our borders open, and building giant prisons everywhere, and sneaking in narcotics.
[02:06:19.486 --> 02:06:29.490]  That's the only group we can trust, but people trying to get into an expo center have got to see a rock concert, have got to be asked if they're terrorists, and ask if they have a recording device and brain scanned.
[02:06:33.051 --> 02:06:34.072]  You know, I'm out of time.
[02:06:34.292 --> 02:06:38.013]  I wanted to play the Fox News piece with Geraldo trying to demonize 9-11 truth.
[02:06:38.333 --> 02:06:43.235]  At the start of the clip, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[02:06:43.255 --> 02:06:46.356]  It's been the news and feature on the front page of YouTube all day, if you want to see it.
[02:06:46.376 --> 02:06:48.557]  It's another easy way on the front page of YouTube.
[02:06:51.428 --> 02:06:53.769]  Geraldo said, oh, this guy's a 9-11 truther.
[02:06:53.789 --> 02:06:55.209]  Does this discredit your movement?
[02:06:55.689 --> 02:07:00.030]  It didn't seem to discredit the tea parties that a tea party guy flew into the building when he was a tea party.
[02:07:03.572 --> 02:07:06.252]  And I pointed out the government has staged terror in the past.
[02:07:06.412 --> 02:07:11.534]  That's the information that gets looked at, not some patsy showing up and doing this out of the blue.
[02:07:14.635 --> 02:07:18.596]  And Geraldo didn't know what to say, and then his co-host basically said that
[02:07:19.807 --> 02:07:25.935]  I was making outrageous claims saying Gulf of Tonkin and other events were staged and Geraldo had to admit, no, no, no, it is staged.
[02:07:26.256 --> 02:07:32.684]  Now I've been telling you they're going to stage terror attacks and blame it on birthers, on truthers, and on tea parties.
[02:07:33.789 --> 02:07:35.070]  And they're now doing it.
[02:07:35.130 --> 02:07:48.781]  And I told you, because out of the blue, with birthers, truthers, and tea parties engaged in no violence ever, out of the blue, all their talking heads started saying, truthers are going to kill Obama, they're going to attack the military, they're going to attack police.
[02:07:49.121 --> 02:07:49.822]  You watch!
[02:07:51.260 --> 02:07:53.341]  That's them preparing the public.
[02:07:53.441 --> 02:07:54.342]  And then it happens.
[02:07:54.662 --> 02:07:55.643]  And then you look at the case.
[02:07:55.763 --> 02:07:56.403]  Underwear bomber.
[02:07:56.603 --> 02:07:57.384]  Family warned.
[02:07:57.724 --> 02:07:59.325]  State Department ordered him let on the plane.
[02:07:59.505 --> 02:08:00.405]  Had him let on the plane.
[02:08:00.445 --> 02:08:01.086]  Now confirmed.
[02:08:01.126 --> 02:08:02.146]  Kurt Haskell confirmed.
[02:08:02.447 --> 02:08:03.107]  All of it proven.
[02:08:03.307 --> 02:08:04.288]  The eyewitness is correct.
[02:08:04.408 --> 02:08:05.368]  FBI admits they lied.
[02:08:05.969 --> 02:08:06.949]  But no investigation.
[02:08:09.371 --> 02:08:11.752]  The Ford Hood shooter, for two years, talked about what he was going to do.
[02:08:11.832 --> 02:08:13.653]  Thought he was emailing Al Qaeda.
[02:08:13.673 --> 02:08:18.116]  Turned out it's this top Al Qaeda guy who works for CIA, who runs all the major patsies.
[02:08:19.716 --> 02:08:25.639]  In every other case, this guy's family warned him months and then weeks before and nothing was done.
[02:08:27.159 --> 02:08:28.940]  They're not releasing the surveillance footage.
[02:08:29.420 --> 02:08:33.822]  Operation Northwoods talks about grazing or wounding troops at U.S.
[02:08:33.862 --> 02:08:40.485]  military bases in D.C., in Miami, and at Guantanamo Bay with people dressed up like Cubans.
[02:08:41.085 --> 02:08:44.947]  And even, folks, they just repeat the same thing over and over again.
[02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:47.500]  They're at a key juncture.
[02:08:47.641 --> 02:08:49.941]  Why are they so afraid of 9-11 truth?
[02:08:50.362 --> 02:08:54.043]  Why are they hell-bent on demonizing 9-11 truth?
[02:08:55.524 --> 02:09:04.067]  Because they can't stage terror attacks anymore to launch new wars because we have educated the public about false flag terror.
[02:09:04.447 --> 02:09:09.870]  We've taken one of their favorite mechanisms of frame-up, of false flag, and we've exposed it.
[02:09:10.690 --> 02:09:14.592]  And so, Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL, Fox, CNN, MSNBC,
[02:09:15.792 --> 02:09:20.414]  Scores of other publications, Time, Newsweek, all particularly naming Alex Jones.
[02:09:21.234 --> 02:09:25.516]  I mean, the London Guardian said that I'm like a black hole of evil and creating mass psychosis.
[02:09:26.056 --> 02:09:36.741]  They are really angry right now, and that's because they want to launch new terror attacks, but they know we're going to be here exposing them, so they think if they discredit us before they stage new terror, no one will listen.
[02:09:37.321 --> 02:09:38.482]  But that's flawed logic.
[02:09:38.722 --> 02:09:41.424]  The idea of looking for the stage terror is now there.
[02:09:41.664 --> 02:09:56.394]  That's why Kurt Haskell, the lawyer and his wife and others, saw them lead the underwear bomber on the plane, saw them protect him without a passport, get him on, saw the man videotaping him, part of a drill, found the other bomb on the plane once they got off, then they lied about that.
[02:09:56.855 --> 02:09:58.616]  All that sense has come out to be true.
[02:09:59.276 --> 02:10:00.317]  But there's no investigation.
[02:10:01.178 --> 02:10:03.359]  Because Haskell and his wife were 9-11 truthers.
[02:10:05.236 --> 02:10:06.619]  We've got people everywhere.
[02:10:07.079 --> 02:10:10.566]  Some polls are in the mid-30s, 36% is the lowest.
[02:10:10.966 --> 02:10:13.791]  Some polls, 84% believe 9-11 is an inside job.
[02:10:13.871 --> 02:10:14.953]  Angus and Reid, New York Times, 2006.
[02:10:17.421 --> 02:10:25.068]  They are panicking, because we've got our people everywhere who are going to record and remember what happens, and we know what to look for now.
[02:10:25.668 --> 02:10:36.899]  I now go to Webster Griffin-Tarpley, a doctorate of history and economics, author of 9-11 Synthetic Terror, made in the USA, a great book on 9-11 that we sell at InfoWars.com.
[02:10:37.739 --> 02:10:43.364]  Webster, I wanted to get you on with some of the past Patsy Ops versus Provocateur or purely staged ops.
[02:10:44.355 --> 02:10:45.076]  Yes, certainly.
[02:10:45.096 --> 02:10:48.018]  There are many indications that this indeed is a staged operation with the Patsy.
[02:10:48.058 --> 02:10:50.239]  And I guess even before we get to the Patsy part,
[02:11:04.938 --> 02:11:07.482]  I guess the starting point is always, is there something fishy?
[02:11:07.582 --> 02:11:09.305]  Is there something suspicious?
[02:11:09.345 --> 02:11:10.527]  Something that doesn't add up?
[02:11:10.587 --> 02:11:20.642]  And I would say in this case, according to ABC News, there's a second individual taken into custody at the shooting, briefly detained and then released after they said that he had nothing to do
[02:11:21.229 --> 02:11:21.969]  With the incident.
[02:11:22.229 --> 02:11:25.551]  The two cops are not being allowed to talk to the press.
[02:11:25.571 --> 02:11:27.111]  Yeah, that's an African immigrant.
[02:11:27.191 --> 02:11:27.691]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:11:27.772 --> 02:11:29.312]  The two people who are slightly wounded.
[02:11:29.352 --> 02:11:31.793]  Well, we think it's the African immigrant, but we don't know.
[02:11:31.853 --> 02:11:35.314]  That could be a cover for some other person that was actually there.
[02:11:35.595 --> 02:11:37.595]  Then we have his family warning in detail.
[02:11:38.376 --> 02:11:38.556]  Right.
[02:11:38.736 --> 02:11:43.838]  But just in terms of this now, the guy, I have to be very brutal about him.
[02:11:43.898 --> 02:11:47.219]  It's a tragic case, but this is someone who is mentally ill.
[02:11:47.579 --> 02:11:48.479]  He is a psychotic.
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:49.820]  He is criminally insane.
[02:11:50.276 --> 02:12:05.400]  And we have the testimony of his psychiatrist, Dr. J. Michael Nelson, says that Bedell has had bipolar disorder, which he could have controlled with medication, but instead he refused his medication and instead turned to marijuana.
[02:12:05.480 --> 02:12:11.261]  And I think that this is the key to it, because in order to be a patsy, it helps to have cognitive impairment.
[02:12:11.321 --> 02:12:13.022]  And that's what we find in this case.
[02:12:13.062 --> 02:12:16.223]  He's been institutionalized many times over the years.
[02:12:16.303 --> 02:12:17.923]  His parents essentially begged
[02:12:18.482 --> 02:12:21.543]  To have the police institutionalize him, hospitalize him.
[02:12:21.903 --> 02:12:33.045]  In that sense, there's a direct parallel to Moutala, where the parents also say that the kid is... He'd also been talking to the Pentagon for five years about some of his inventions and had talked about traveling to meet with them there.
[02:12:33.305 --> 02:12:37.466]  So he could have just been a mentally ill person they had, they shoot a few of their people, kill him.
[02:12:38.026 --> 02:12:38.266]  Right.
[02:12:38.346 --> 02:12:46.688]  Now, the question of 9-11 truth, I think this is complete red herring, because what I see about this is this is a kind of a throwaway line, a chance comment,
[02:12:47.276 --> 02:12:53.121]  Four or five years ago, he's interested in this Sabau case, but he's not really interested in 9-11.
[02:12:53.141 --> 02:12:58.786]  If we look at him in terms of action rather than rhetoric, action for him means narcotics.
[02:12:58.886 --> 02:13:00.487]  He is devoted to narcotics.
[02:13:01.028 --> 02:13:03.089]  He wants a society based on narcotics.
[02:13:03.129 --> 02:13:06.172]  He wants marijuana to be the basis of the currency.
[02:13:06.592 --> 02:13:09.155]  He wants billions and billions of marijuana plants.
[02:13:09.815 --> 02:13:12.798]  And of course, then it gets into his arrest record.
[02:13:12.838 --> 02:13:15.500]  And I think this is where you also see this question of the Patsy.
[02:13:16.024 --> 02:13:24.109]  The Patsy gets away with murder, or he gets away with things that the average person never could and that would be in jail.
[02:13:24.169 --> 02:13:30.192]  Now in this case, in 2006 he's arrested in California for growing marijuana plants.
[02:13:30.272 --> 02:13:37.677]  Now he may have a medical marijuana card and that may get him off, but he's also in there for resisting arrest in California.
[02:13:38.037 --> 02:13:39.698]  Then we have him picked up in Texas.
[02:13:40.390 --> 02:13:44.151]  Uh, in January for speeding, but also with a marijuana pipe.
[02:13:44.251 --> 02:13:47.632]  And the state police officer called his parents and said he seems like he's out of his mind.
[02:13:47.712 --> 02:13:49.592]  Well, I'm sure we know he fits the M.O.
[02:13:49.612 --> 02:13:50.932]  of the past in that front.
[02:13:50.972 --> 02:13:59.374]  The reason I wanted to get you on, though, was to go over some of the history of other type mental deficiencies they've used, where it's turned out it was provocateur actions.
[02:13:59.774 --> 02:14:03.515]  Yeah, well, again, the Reno, Nevada case is also, I think, significant.
[02:14:03.535 --> 02:14:07.576]  He's got pipes, he's got, he's driving under the influence of marijuana.
[02:14:07.596 --> 02:14:08.876]  He's driving while drugged.
[02:14:09.344 --> 02:14:14.868]  And, nevertheless, he's able to go on what is described as a six-to-eight-week driving spree.
[02:14:15.369 --> 02:14:16.409]  Where does he get the money?
[02:14:16.569 --> 02:14:18.051]  And then he shows up at the Pentagon.
[02:14:18.091 --> 02:14:21.253]  Where was he during this six-to-eight-week period?
[02:14:21.293 --> 02:14:22.654]  Now, the parallels.
[02:14:23.695 --> 02:14:31.260]  Major Hassan is someone who worked at the Walter Reed Army Hospital here in Washington, D.C.
[02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:35.824]  He was active at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center, so he's a shrink among shrinks.
[02:14:36.633 --> 02:14:42.318]  And we have these memos from his colleagues saying, this man is a psychotic.
[02:14:42.678 --> 02:14:46.781]  He talks about Islam, but basically his problem is that he's a psychotic.
[02:14:47.282 --> 02:14:48.123]  And nothing happened.
[02:14:48.943 --> 02:14:55.789]  Similarly with Muttala, the parents, in this case, with Bedell, have begged the police to take him into custody.
[02:14:56.249 --> 02:14:56.990]  Nothing happened.
[02:14:57.030 --> 02:15:00.893]  So we look at Bedell, he's got four or five things going for him.
[02:15:00.913 --> 02:15:03.435]  He's got marijuana convictions, feeding convictions.
[02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:06.781]  Uh, put in a missing persons report.
[02:15:06.821 --> 02:15:09.103]  They say he may be armed, may be dangerous.
[02:15:09.644 --> 02:15:10.644]  Nothing happens.
[02:15:11.165 --> 02:15:12.726]  So it seems to me you've got two sides.
[02:15:12.786 --> 02:15:21.373]  If you want to call anybody to account, let's call in George Soros and ask him about the implications of marijuana and narcotics for this case.
[02:15:21.883 --> 02:15:23.484]  Rather than pin it on 9-11.
[02:15:23.544 --> 02:15:26.086]  I don't think you can really use these cases to pin it on anybody.
[02:15:26.446 --> 02:15:33.631]  But in this case, there is a direct role of marijuana in the guy's psychosis, which prepares him for the role that he's been playing.
[02:15:33.651 --> 02:15:35.112]  Okay, we know you hate marijuana, Webster.
[02:15:35.132 --> 02:15:35.592]  That's great.
[02:15:35.872 --> 02:15:51.543]  My issue is, I wanted to get you on, because you're very researched on all the other patsies from Miami and in the Bronx, and just over and over again, where they go and set up these patsies.
[02:15:52.103 --> 02:16:02.612]  I think that the most recent one that we should keep our eyes on is, again, Major Hassan, because he's somebody who behaves in a very erratic and outrageous way.
[02:16:03.072 --> 02:16:11.419]  In the case of Major Hassan, the Fort Hood shooter, this is also somebody who's got a secret level clearance, because by virtue of being a Major in the U.S.
[02:16:11.519 --> 02:16:12.340]  Army, he's got this
[02:16:13.010 --> 02:16:23.834]  And that would put him normally under special... And he's emailing this top Al-Qaeda guy who runs all the other patsies over and over again, and then they declare national security on all his emails.
[02:16:24.134 --> 02:16:24.335]  Right.
[02:16:24.475 --> 02:16:25.335]  So he's sheep-dipped.
[02:16:25.375 --> 02:16:38.100]  So essentially, if we look back again, if we look at the Fort Hood, if we look at the Fort Dix 6, if we look at the Miami Haitians, these other cases that we've had,
[02:16:38.550 --> 02:16:46.994]  We can see that the idea of a troubled subject, a subject with mental illness or cognitive impairment.
[02:16:47.014 --> 02:16:58.639]  You can also see it in the alleged attempt to blow up the fuel lines going into Kennedy Airport on the part of a kind of a street vagrant who also had a history of mental disease.
[02:16:58.679 --> 02:16:59.940]  So you see this again and again.
[02:17:00.340 --> 02:17:04.702]  It means that these individuals are susceptible to manipulation.
[02:17:04.822 --> 02:17:06.123]  And again, I would like to know
[02:17:06.875 --> 02:17:17.782]  What was Bidell doing during the time from about January 18th, when he seems to have gone back to his home for a short time, and this past week when he showed up?
[02:17:17.802 --> 02:17:19.744]  Okay, Webster, I'm going to skip this break.
[02:17:19.764 --> 02:17:22.966]  This is a network break, so it's ours for the stations out there.
[02:17:22.986 --> 02:17:33.272]  We're going to skip the Genesis break right now, finish up with the Patsy background, but then let's expand on why are they running
[02:17:34.113 --> 02:17:36.815]  I think it's an exercise in neo-McCarthyite hysteria.
[02:17:36.855 --> 02:17:40.237]  It is similar to old demagogue Senator Joe McCarthy and the Red Scare of the 1950s.
[02:17:40.257 --> 02:17:42.639]  This time the names of the targets are different.
[02:18:03.789 --> 02:18:13.340]  The immediate setting, and we should be aware of this, is a worldwide revolt against Wall Street and bankers and the International Monetary Fund and the power of bankers.
[02:18:13.781 --> 02:18:14.722]  Just three examples.
[02:18:15.970 --> 02:18:30.198]  The Goldman Sachs attacks Greece is a way of getting at the Euro, and now the people in Greece are told that their health education, welfare, social safety net wages are all going to be destroyed because Goldman Sachs and George Soros again are attacking the currency.
[02:18:30.238 --> 02:18:35.901]  So they've had one general strike ten days ago, they're going to have another general strike this week, so they're fighting.
[02:18:36.380 --> 02:18:43.304]  Iceland, on Saturday, the referendum, will Iceland pay $6 billion to the British and the Dutch?
[02:18:43.344 --> 02:18:51.489]  It's the equivalent of $130 per person, per month, for the next six to eight years, depending on the interest.
[02:18:51.890 --> 02:18:53.811]  So they say no.
[02:18:54.271 --> 02:18:58.514]  92% of Iceland says no, we will not pay the banks, we will not be slaves of the banks.
[02:18:58.894 --> 02:19:04.097]  And then, in this country, something that I think is very, very significant, we've had on 100 campuses in 33 states,
[02:19:05.760 --> 02:19:19.328]  An upsurge of student activism saying no to tuition cuts, no to increased payments, especially in cases like California, where part of the money is going to go straight into the hands of Wall Street bankers as a result of the bondage.
[02:19:19.448 --> 02:19:23.290]  And it's hard for the media to demonize them as evil right-wing Tea Party people.
[02:19:24.411 --> 02:19:31.115]  Certainly, and their program is also quite different, and I think their program makes a lot more sense than some of these other programs.
[02:19:31.135 --> 02:19:34.937]  So the students are essentially trying to defend their right to an education.
[02:19:35.485 --> 02:19:46.090]  I don't think they have a right to it, but they've paid for it, and we know that the big universities take most of the money and invest it in derivatives, like the University of Texas, so they do have a right to not be ripped off.
[02:19:46.250 --> 02:19:47.931]  Yeah, the large schools.
[02:19:47.991 --> 02:19:55.975]  I mean, look, Harvard, Yale, MIT, Princeton, all the rest of them have lost between one quarter and one third of their endowment because of derivative speculation.
[02:19:56.015 --> 02:20:00.197]  Some lost more, but yeah, so now they're trying to... Larry Summers, up at Harvard, played a big role.
[02:20:00.897 --> 02:20:05.038]  What you see, I think, is the beginning of a mass strike period, but this time a real one.
[02:20:05.378 --> 02:20:17.202]  In other words, real economic self-defense as the bankers turn the screws and demand more austerity, take away your Social Security, take away your Medicare, take away your unemployment benefits.
[02:20:17.222 --> 02:20:23.344]  They're going to stage events to demonize all of their political opposition, but I don't see this working, Webster.
[02:20:24.409 --> 02:20:26.871]  I think this depends on all of us.
[02:20:27.772 --> 02:20:30.874]  It seems to me that it's a complete red herring.
[02:20:30.894 --> 02:20:41.421]  This is completely outrageous that they want to take some four-year-old scrap of a quote and characterize this mentally ill, criminally insane, homicidal maniac.
[02:20:41.441 --> 02:20:43.382]  But that's more evidence of it being staged.
[02:20:43.402 --> 02:20:48.066]  They were ready within an hour and five minutes to run with this and go after yours truly.
[02:20:48.526 --> 02:20:50.327]  In that case, let's look at the other side of it.
[02:20:50.367 --> 02:20:52.188]  Now, let's look at the Obama White House.
[02:20:52.228 --> 02:20:52.889]  Who do we find?
[02:20:53.297 --> 02:20:55.438]  We find this odd couple, I would say.
[02:20:55.819 --> 02:21:05.005]  Cass Sunstein, who is the regulations czar, and his wife, his new wife of about a year, and that's Samantha Power.
[02:21:05.405 --> 02:21:12.670]  You remember her foul-mouthed interventions during the primary campaign, cursing out Hillary Clinton in a British interview.
[02:21:13.194 --> 02:21:15.095]  Cass Sunstein and Samantha Power.
[02:21:15.135 --> 02:21:20.799]  Samantha Power is now the Director of Multilateral Relations at the National Security Council.
[02:21:20.819 --> 02:21:23.801]  Yeah, Sunstein's calling for provocateuring 9-11 truth.
[02:21:24.081 --> 02:21:30.085]  Right, and therefore we can say Sunstein is obviously a left totalitarian thinker.
[02:21:30.165 --> 02:21:33.607]  Obviously somebody who hates the First Amendment, can't stand normal political process.
[02:21:33.627 --> 02:21:35.548]  He says that, yeah, he says ban freedom.
[02:21:35.568 --> 02:21:38.290]  He says he wants to tax conspiracy theories.
[02:21:38.330 --> 02:21:39.331]  This is unbelievable.
[02:21:40.605 --> 02:21:42.729]  This is an absolute crackpot.
[02:21:43.069 --> 02:21:46.815]  But you see, this is a power couple inside the Obama regime.
[02:21:46.855 --> 02:21:50.961]  Now, when we look at these things that Bedell is alleged to have said,
[02:21:51.545 --> 02:21:57.147]  How do we know that these computer postings on the internet are really from Bedell?
[02:21:57.167 --> 02:21:59.707]  By the way, for those that don't know, you're not just saying this.
[02:21:59.747 --> 02:22:13.832]  Cass Sunstein, a year and a half ago, at Chicago Law School, in conjunction with Harvard, wrote, we will go out on the internet, we will pose as 9-11 truthers and say horrible things, we will infiltrate their groups and try to create violence.
[02:22:14.292 --> 02:22:18.573]  I mean, so you're saying it looks like, well yeah, I mean Cass Sunstein's probably involved in this.
[02:22:18.933 --> 02:22:19.713]  We just don't know.
[02:22:19.753 --> 02:22:28.137]  In other words, it is real folly to take the ravings of a psychotic in any case, but ravings of a psychotic posted on the internet, which could be anybody.
[02:22:28.297 --> 02:22:29.998]  This could be an intelligence agency.
[02:22:30.018 --> 02:22:30.478]  My gosh.
[02:22:30.699 --> 02:22:33.020]  The National Security Council can certainly do these things.
[02:22:33.040 --> 02:22:39.343]  Well, in closing, separately, Adam Gadon, this ADL guy, they claim they captured him yesterday and then announced, oh, we didn't capture him.
[02:22:39.583 --> 02:22:43.765]  I mean, this is just like three weeks ago when they claimed they captured number two in Taliban.
[02:22:44.025 --> 02:22:45.306]  The next day said they didn't do it.
[02:22:45.546 --> 02:22:47.827]  And that's an intelligence op where they throw it out.
[02:22:48.527 --> 02:22:51.589]  And then set the precedent that they can just lie and get away with it.
[02:22:52.149 --> 02:22:54.271]  Well, maybe they want to remind us who this character is.
[02:22:54.651 --> 02:23:02.056]  All I can say with this Adam Gidon is that his story is very fishy and it seemed to me to be fishy for the last several years.
[02:23:02.936 --> 02:23:04.617]  Maybe they'll get their story together.
[02:23:04.937 --> 02:23:12.022]  But it seems like they want to remind us who he is so that if they do claim to have captured him, it won't be ho-hum, it will be, oh, the most wanted
[02:23:14.417 --> 02:23:19.681]  Bottom line, why are they so scared of 9-11 Truth right now?
[02:23:20.202 --> 02:23:30.211]  I think it's because they want to use this to launch a situation of the neo-McCarthyite demonization of any kind of critical or opposition thinking.
[02:23:30.591 --> 02:23:34.554]  And again, I think it has to do with the fact that we're going into some kind of a mass strike period.
[02:23:34.875 --> 02:23:37.417]  You could see the American labor movement now
[02:23:38.075 --> 02:23:39.056]  Returning to life.
[02:23:39.316 --> 02:23:49.225]  Because if the students can come back to life after decades of the campuses being political graveyards, the labor movement... Obama has just gone through his Patco moment.
[02:23:49.245 --> 02:23:53.468]  Remember when Ronald Reagan broke and destroyed the Air Traffic Controllers Union?
[02:23:53.769 --> 02:23:56.291]  Last week we had this school in Rhode Island.
[02:23:56.638 --> 02:23:57.118]  We're good to go.
[02:24:11.910 --> 02:24:13.872]  Obama's now having his Reagan moment.
[02:24:13.912 --> 02:24:14.992]  He's channeling Reagan.
[02:24:15.092 --> 02:24:23.838]  And you said that that would be, you said that would be his specialty as this Bill and Melinda Gates, Ford Foundation funded minion, fake left cover.
[02:24:24.118 --> 02:24:27.621]  His job in Chicago was breaking up the unions.
[02:24:29.227 --> 02:24:31.510]  And again, love the unions, hate them.
[02:24:31.530 --> 02:24:34.313]  They're destroying any way we can politically organize.
[02:24:46.073 --> 02:24:47.514]  Everything must go to the bankers.
[02:24:47.774 --> 02:24:55.096]  Well, I'll say this, Webster, I believe they're getting ready to stage more terror attacks in Blame It On 9-11 Truth, more to blame the Tea Party, more to blame the in-the-fetters.
[02:24:55.517 --> 02:24:57.057]  I want to put you on hold here at the end of the show.
[02:24:57.077 --> 02:25:01.799]  I'll try to schedule you in the next week for a full hour, so we're not as breakneck.
