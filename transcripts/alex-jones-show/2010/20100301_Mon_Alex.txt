[00:00:02.055 --> 00:00:09.358]  Nearly four decades after abortion became legal, a woman's right to choose continues to anger millions of Americans.
[00:00:10.038 --> 00:00:14.260]  Pro-life advocates regard abortion as the killing of an unborn human.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.162]  But according to Pastor Clenard Childress, Roe vs. Wade doesn't just target babies.
[00:00:20.622 --> 00:00:27.185]  The New Jersey Reverend says the Supreme Court ruling is being used to wipe out an entire race of people.
[00:00:27.565 --> 00:00:29.826]  Pastor Clenard Howard Childress, thank you for joining me.
[00:00:30.086 --> 00:00:30.887]  Thank you for having me.
[00:00:31.027 --> 00:00:36.752]  I understand that you are the founder of a pro-life website called blackgenocide.org.
[00:00:37.012 --> 00:00:37.232]  Yes.
[00:00:37.532 --> 00:00:38.794]  Why did you start this website?
[00:00:39.214 --> 00:00:57.510]  Well, when I heard the disproportionate amount of African-American women that were falling prey to the abortion industry and knowing indeed that abortion had now become very much a part of the decision-making African-American women
[00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:19.945]  We're making or doing the numbers staggered me and so african-american women make up 12% of the population but 36% of the abortions and for every at this present time for every two african-american women to get pregnant
[00:01:21.213 --> 00:01:23.254]  One will choose to abort.
[00:01:23.634 --> 00:01:26.996]  52% of all African-American pregnancies end in abortion.
[00:01:27.036 --> 00:01:31.719]  And that's from Alan Guttmacher, who sat on the board of Planned Parenthood.
[00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:39.963]  So, these are statistics that should cause anyone concerned, and thus blackgenocide.org.
[00:01:40.808 --> 00:01:49.418]  Why is it that you believe these women are victims of a system rather than making decisions on what they want to do?
[00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.964]  No doubt the abortion industry targets African Americans, minorities.
[00:01:54.984 --> 00:01:56.906]  78% of all Planned Parenthoods
[00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.016]  Abortuaries, I call them, but clinics are located in minority neighborhoods.
[00:02:06.236 --> 00:02:10.641]  The targeting of African Americans has now been documented.
[00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:20.010]  So we have to look at the abortion industry and look at the philosophic views and minorities is something that they want less of.
[00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:22.633]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg made the comment
[00:02:23.454 --> 00:02:34.222]  At the time Roe vs. Wade was decided, we believe they were trying to get rid of populations that we don't want too many of.
[00:02:35.102 --> 00:02:37.984]  She made that comment July 11th.
[00:02:40.584 --> 00:02:44.305]  2009 and today of last year.
[00:02:44.625 --> 00:02:53.867]  Today we're seeing that Roe vs. Wade was not decided based on law, but based on ideology.
[00:02:54.247 --> 00:03:09.250]  Just to clarify, you're saying that abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood are purposefully trying to unleash genocide on the African American female community?
[00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.810]  That is their intent.
[00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.650]  Well, yes.
[00:03:12.691 --> 00:03:15.331]  If abortion was not lucrative, it would not be legal.
[00:03:15.951 --> 00:03:26.653]  There's no question that Planned Parenthood, the leader of the abortion industry in this country, they account for 18% of all abortions.
[00:03:27.453 --> 00:03:38.315]  And when you look at the abortion leader, and you look at their ideology and their philosophy and their roots, and see where all their abortion clinics are located,
[00:03:39.695 --> 00:03:54.082]  In Houston, right now, they're building a mega, it's an enormous building, in the African-American neighborhood, and Hispanic, designed for completely abortion.
[00:03:54.642 --> 00:03:58.004]  They're marketing abortion, not women's health care.
[00:03:58.524 --> 00:04:06.828]  They're marketing abortion, and many people need to know, on that building, in that building, there's a floor dedicated
[00:04:07.483 --> 00:04:08.804]  To late-term abortions.
[00:04:09.604 --> 00:04:15.408]  And I want America to know late-term abortions are still going on in this country.
[00:04:15.988 --> 00:04:27.254]  And so we have to understand that the ideology, the philosophic views of the eugenics movement was to target African-Americans and they're still being targeted today.
[00:04:27.615 --> 00:04:34.739]  Planned Parenthood provides other services other than abortions for the patients that go there to the clinics.
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.844]  And all their patients are not black women.
[00:04:38.325 --> 00:04:42.693]  They have women that are of all race, all religions, all ethnicities.
[00:04:43.334 --> 00:04:46.079]  What do you say about all the white women that get abortions?
[00:04:46.179 --> 00:04:47.642]  Well, I'm looking at the locations.
[00:04:48.536 --> 00:04:51.838]  Locations, you go to the market that you're trying to reach.
[00:04:52.538 --> 00:04:53.799]  And that's African Americans.
[00:04:53.819 --> 00:05:00.483]  Anyone who studies marketing would know, indeed, that's what you do if you want to reach the Hispanic community.
[00:05:00.503 --> 00:05:04.265]  You don't set up in the Italian community, you set up in the Hispanic community.
[00:05:04.845 --> 00:05:11.009]  Now, as far as these other services, Planned Parenthood well knows that if they can engage our youth,
[00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:23.718]  At a young age and be their health provider when it comes to the mindset of what they're going to do and how they're going to engage in their sexuality.
[00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:25.520]  We will sell you the condoms.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.922]  We'll give you the test.
[00:05:28.502 --> 00:05:32.085]  We become your guru, your teacher, your mentor.
[00:05:33.506 --> 00:05:38.230]  If Planned Parenthood was really interested in the health of these women
[00:05:39.096 --> 00:05:43.938]  They would tell them about the obvious links between abortion and breast cancer.
[00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:58.045]  And we're going to talk about those documented, scientific, hundreds of major studies that every abortion you have massively increases your chance of getting different types of cancer.
[00:05:59.926 --> 00:06:04.588]  If your body is meant to abort a baby, 99% of the time it will.
[00:06:04.648 --> 00:06:05.949]  It's very unnatural.
[00:06:07.383 --> 00:06:16.687]  Making the film Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, I didn't just believe the quotes by Margaret Sanger and Planned Parenthood and others even in modern times.
[00:06:16.867 --> 00:06:18.628]  I went to the universities.
[00:06:18.788 --> 00:06:24.310]  I sent off for copies of the actual letters where they call black people weeds that must be exterminated.
[00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:33.234]  And you see Bill Gates and his vaccine program clearly tied to reduced fertility, sterilization, Nobel laureates on record.
[00:06:34.094 --> 00:06:36.796]  Even BBC reporting that women are getting HIV.
[00:06:36.836 --> 00:06:40.279]  You've never had sex in Africa, but they've had vaccinations.
[00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:42.320]  They were caught in Libya doing this.
[00:06:43.021 --> 00:06:53.109]  We have the UN and their internal documents that I covered in Endgame saying they want to force inoculate to introduce cancer viruses, autoimmune viruses.
[00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:55.931]  This is going on against everyone, but
[00:06:57.148 --> 00:07:04.890]  Going back over a hundred years ago, when eugenics was like a rock and roll craze, up until the 40s when Hitler embarrassed them, they then changed the name of it.
[00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:11.171]  Blacks were the number one target because they could sell more people in the community on going along with it.
[00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:17.533]  On that Russia Today video piece we played half of, we'll put it back on screen, it's Abortion Inc.
[00:07:17.933 --> 00:07:19.493]  Is it carrying out black genocide?
[00:07:20.293 --> 00:07:20.974]  Abortion Inc.
[00:07:21.214 --> 00:07:22.254]  Promoting black genocide.
[00:07:23.467 --> 00:07:24.528]  Inside the United States.
[00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:32.737]  In the comments, I see people in there, the minority, but still they're there, saying, you black people complain about everything.
[00:07:32.777 --> 00:07:34.518]  You black people always say you're the victim.
[00:07:34.538 --> 00:07:37.201]  You black people always say people are out to get you.
[00:07:37.922 --> 00:07:39.784]  And yeah, well there are too many black people.
[00:07:39.824 --> 00:07:41.666]  There are too many black thugs out there.
[00:07:41.986 --> 00:07:42.987]  On and on and on and on.
[00:07:43.327 --> 00:07:46.711]  And then see, once that idea has been accepted,
[00:07:48.345 --> 00:07:49.606]  Then it could be done to everybody.
[00:07:49.686 --> 00:07:56.008]  I remember debating Planned Parenthood people and debating CPS when they were seizing people's kids for no reason.
[00:07:56.749 --> 00:08:01.251]  They would email me, write me, call me, or in person say, who's going to adopt all these black babies?
[00:08:01.311 --> 00:08:01.991]  Are you going to do it?
[00:08:02.351 --> 00:08:03.311]  Yeah, we're getting rid of them.
[00:08:03.912 --> 00:08:09.554]  And it's come out in the news that you can call up Planned Parenthood and say, I want to give money specifically to get rid of black babies.
[00:08:09.674 --> 00:08:10.735]  Absolutely, we agree.
[00:08:10.775 --> 00:08:11.295]  We'll help you.
[00:08:12.307 --> 00:08:14.109]  This is a eugenics organization.
[00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.553]  And Bill Gates' father, of course, formerly headed it.
[00:08:18.153 --> 00:08:20.196]  And they're all pushing this agenda right now.
[00:08:20.236 --> 00:08:26.042]  The carbon taxes are about cutting off everybody's resources where you can't even afford to have children now.
[00:08:26.763 --> 00:08:34.111]  And so I wanted to have Pastor on our show today from blackgenocide.org because he's been fighting this
[00:08:35.435 --> 00:08:36.936]  For more than a decade.
[00:08:36.956 --> 00:08:44.301]  And he's been standing up against this corrupt system and fighting for more than a decade.
[00:08:44.321 --> 00:08:49.185]  And so we're going to get him to break down basically what we face as a society.
[00:08:49.945 --> 00:08:54.468]  But the fact is there's more people wanting to adopt every year in the U.S.
[00:08:54.488 --> 00:09:00.233]  That's why people import folks from South Korea and Europe and other places and Haiti.
[00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:05.037]  And the truth is, people do want to adopt black babies, brown babies, white babies.
[00:09:06.699 --> 00:09:16.529]  But the system knows this, and they don't tell you when you're at Planned Parenthood that there are Christian groups who will 100% of the time pay you, take care of you, and help adopt the baby.
[00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.631]  No, they just say kill the baby.
[00:09:19.412 --> 00:09:23.473]  And so this is a window into a much bigger situation.
[00:09:23.513 --> 00:09:30.275]  So I've prefaced that now, but I want to go to Pastor Leonard Howard Childress Jr.
[00:09:30.655 --> 00:09:32.496]  from blackgenocide.org.
[00:09:32.556 --> 00:09:33.656]  Pastor, thanks for joining us.
[00:09:33.896 --> 00:09:36.197]  Oh, thank you very much for having me.
[00:09:36.237 --> 00:09:44.659]  Break down your awakening, who you are, what you've done, your research, what we're facing here, and obviously the larger eugenics operation.
[00:09:45.759 --> 00:09:48.000]  Well, you know, sometimes the longer I stay in it,
[00:09:49.156 --> 00:10:03.102]  The more I find that it's a humongous machine, that I feel the only way it could be uprooted at this point is for the Church, that God has always used the Church to deal with all social injustices.
[00:10:03.322 --> 00:10:18.489]  But how I began was just defending the unborn here locally in my normal teaching, did not even know such thing as the pro-life movement or pro-choice, all the terminology, and a young lady who
[00:10:19.491 --> 00:10:21.172]  More involved than I was regionally.
[00:10:22.132 --> 00:10:25.174]  Asked me, did I want to get more involved in the movement?
[00:10:25.214 --> 00:10:31.277]  She had met one of my students walking by an abortion clinic, thinking she was going to go in.
[00:10:31.337 --> 00:10:34.838]  She approached her and she said, no, my pastor taught me about this already.
[00:10:36.139 --> 00:10:38.460]  And she said, well, who is your pastor?
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:44.683]  And that led to me going to LEARN, Life Education Resource Network.
[00:10:44.703 --> 00:10:46.564]  There was a conference down at Virginia Beach.
[00:10:48.766 --> 00:10:52.347]  I felt that I should go, and my wife and myself went.
[00:10:52.547 --> 00:11:09.693]  The first time I heard of the Negro Project, and even why Akua Farrow was the presenter, and I heard of the eugenic design, the mindset, the ideology, the players, and I was stunned.
[00:11:09.973 --> 00:11:17.175]  And I was stunned to find, even more so, having gone to college and gone to
[00:11:18.255 --> 00:11:21.297]  Uh, seminary, that I never heard any of these things.
[00:11:21.997 --> 00:11:24.778]  Not so much as an iota of these things.
[00:11:25.118 --> 00:11:30.081]  And yet, it was prevalent, dominating, and at that time, the figure was 1,042.
[00:11:30.941 --> 00:11:35.543]  1,452 African American children killed each day.
[00:11:36.183 --> 00:11:45.408]  And here I was, a shepherd, and didn't know of this devouring agent that was preying upon the African American community to the degree in which it was.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:12:01.148]  I talked to Pastor Johnny Hunter, National Director, and I said, I want to partner with you in addressing this issue nationally and locally, and thus began my quest.
[00:12:01.168 --> 00:12:14.395]  And in 2001, I came up with the idea, but in 2002, we launched the website blackgenocide.org, and actually, the young computer
[00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:25.244]  Michael Spielman, who does Abort.73, another great website if you want to see what abortion is.
[00:12:26.245 --> 00:12:27.926]  He was helping me put the site together.
[00:12:27.946 --> 00:12:30.008]  We put all the information together.
[00:12:30.028 --> 00:12:31.149]  He said, what are you going to call it?
[00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:34.892]  And I said, ah, just call it Learn, I guess.
[00:12:34.992 --> 00:12:35.812]  Learn Northeast.
[00:12:35.832 --> 00:12:36.613]  It's just a reach.
[00:12:36.693 --> 00:12:38.034]  I want to reach the African-Americans.
[00:12:38.698 --> 00:12:40.039]  We're good to go.
[00:13:00.216 --> 00:13:03.682]  Well we're going to break down with you the real numbers.
[00:13:04.162 --> 00:13:08.349]  52%, and that's conservative, of blacks never get born, they're murdered.
[00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:12.055]  That is a bigger statistical genocide than we've even seen
[00:13:13.228 --> 00:13:16.549]  In Rwanda, against the Tootsies, or what we saw with Hitler.
[00:13:16.889 --> 00:13:23.031]  This is a real genocide, and eugenics is the religion of the elite.
[00:13:23.371 --> 00:13:27.653]  They teach it as phony environmentalism, that humans are a disease and a scourge.
[00:13:28.173 --> 00:13:30.994]  This is what funds the entire global government movement.
[00:13:31.034 --> 00:13:32.374]  It's what you always find.
[00:13:32.394 --> 00:13:34.315]  It's what all the big banks fund.
[00:13:34.335 --> 00:13:39.457]  And blacks are their number one target, but they're doing it to everyone now.
[00:13:40.117 --> 00:13:49.267]  And so all these fools out there that are racist deep down and say, yeah, get rid of these black people or get rid of these brown people, you know, all the white supremacists out there, it's being done to you as well.
[00:13:49.327 --> 00:13:50.268]  This is for everyone.
[00:13:50.308 --> 00:13:53.091]  But blacks are the apple of the globalist eye.
[00:13:53.772 --> 00:13:58.798]  And I just want to add that, you know, the good news is we see national statistics.
[00:13:59.238 --> 00:14:12.768]  More and more people are beginning to wake up to this, but let's break down the Black Genocide Program, the Negro Program, as it was called by Margaret Sanger and the Rockefeller Foundation, and what these mass murderers are doing right now.
[00:14:13.529 --> 00:14:27.279]  Well, no question about it, it was a systemic design by the eugenics, the elitists of this nation, and who are very much more in power than I ever dreamed could
[00:14:28.183 --> 00:14:28.603]  We're good to go.
[00:14:52.521 --> 00:14:57.063]  They would not be deemed as suspicious, and that was through abortion.
[00:14:57.083 --> 00:15:05.765]  It was also through commandeering key African-American iconic figures to condone it.
[00:15:06.226 --> 00:15:07.926]  And this is the greatest strategy.
[00:15:09.007 --> 00:15:10.327]  You know, Jesse Jackson, 1977.
[00:15:13.797 --> 00:15:20.363]  It's basically where I coined the phrase black genocide was from Jesse Jackson who said abortion is black genocide.
[00:15:20.643 --> 00:15:25.808]  What happens to a mind of a person in the moral fabric of a nation that can abort a baby without a pang of conscience?
[00:15:26.237 --> 00:15:31.099]  Yeah, that's the one good thing about Jesse Jackson is he did come out against that.
[00:15:31.119 --> 00:15:32.779]  And you go back to what W.E.D.
[00:15:32.799 --> 00:15:35.520]  Du Bois and others, you read Margaret Singer's letters.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.401]  She said, we can't let these people know we want to kill them.
[00:15:38.421 --> 00:15:39.221]  They don't trust us.
[00:15:39.522 --> 00:15:41.042]  We've got to get rid of these weeds.
[00:15:41.342 --> 00:15:42.883]  We've got to hire black leaders.
[00:15:43.243 --> 00:15:43.803]  Exactly.
[00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:49.185]  Three or four colored ministers with engaging social backgrounds with their specific back words.
[00:15:50.195 --> 00:15:58.759]  And Jesse, when he decided to be president, he wanted to be president, realized he wasn't going to get the money he needed unless he switched his position.
[00:15:59.559 --> 00:16:03.841]  And so he literally became a shepherd leading the sheep to the slaughter.
[00:16:04.761 --> 00:16:08.243]  So early on he was good, but then he flip-flopped for power.
[00:16:09.223 --> 00:16:11.464]  How many millions of blacks have been exterminated?
[00:16:12.344 --> 00:16:13.865]  16 million, and that is a concern.
[00:16:15.154 --> 00:16:19.077]  I mean, is a billion dollars worth it to kill 16 million of your own people or anybody?
[00:16:19.518 --> 00:16:28.825]  I mean, Satan could lead me up on a mountain and say, I will make you God on Earth if you'll kill one child, and I wouldn't do it if they were black or polka-dotted or green or white.
[00:16:29.966 --> 00:16:31.047]  I mean, this is so evil.
[00:16:31.727 --> 00:16:39.853]  It is unquestionably evil, and it's very sad commentary to the civil rights movement because Dr. King died in 1968.
[00:16:41.702 --> 00:17:10.730]  And he more or less never was really a designated Joshua to come in and lead, and basically they began to fight amongst themselves for power, and this brought about an opportunity with Roe vs. Wade, which was right around the corner, to offer money to these leaders, and they basically defying their silence and asking for their allegiance.
[00:17:11.167 --> 00:17:13.228]  And now 16 million dead people.
[00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:22.453]  16 million, and then there's just the consciousness of the deaf culture being so deeply embedded in the African-American community.
[00:17:22.533 --> 00:17:33.979]  The fact that we would embrace a message that would cause a woman to do the antithetical thing about life being in her, and that is to kill it.
[00:17:34.019 --> 00:17:40.082]  That is just the opposite of God, of faith, of a walk
[00:17:41.226 --> 00:17:44.668]  Of, of, you know, religious, uh, bringing.
[00:18:02.472 --> 00:18:03.733]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:18:03.773 --> 00:18:09.115]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:18:09.355 --> 00:18:13.978]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:18:14.378 --> 00:18:19.460]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:18:19.961 --> 00:18:24.623]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[00:21:06.806 --> 00:21:19.792]  Here's a Times of London headline from May 24th of last year.
[00:21:20.413 --> 00:21:23.294]  Billionaire club and bid to curb overpopulation.
[00:21:24.435 --> 00:21:28.297]  The Rockefellers, Ted Turner, Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey.
[00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:37.499]  Secret meeting, it says at the end of the article, for a world government to forcibly reduce world population.
[00:21:37.639 --> 00:21:46.991]  Now, it's a litmus test for political candidates in the Democratic Party, but the Republicans, they could have overturned this.
[00:21:47.471 --> 00:21:48.773]  Most of them go along with it as well.
[00:21:49.707 --> 00:21:51.348]  To carry out this extermination.
[00:21:51.588 --> 00:22:02.057]  And Barack Obama, when he got in power, took the hold off of billions of dollars in Africa, where they come into villages and basically force abortions on people just like China.
[00:22:02.737 --> 00:22:07.201]  And if you'll adopt this, the big global system gives you all the power, because it's about killing.
[00:22:07.841 --> 00:22:15.127]  Just like Pharaoh demanded the firstborn be sacrificed, so many other kings throughout history demand your firstborn, or they demand your children.
[00:22:15.407 --> 00:22:16.668]  It's an act of submission.
[00:22:16.748 --> 00:22:17.589]  It's a death cult.
[00:22:18.587 --> 00:22:24.889]  Again, I've come through this from studying the globalist's own writings, and they know what they're doing.
[00:22:25.209 --> 00:22:34.352]  And this is going on against all communities, but the main focus of this Luciferian system is killing black people.
[00:22:35.112 --> 00:22:48.116]  Going back to the Reverend, Reverend Childress, please continue, sir, breaking down what you were getting into with the black leaders, the 52% of blacks never being born, and how we stop this.
[00:22:48.936 --> 00:22:51.557]  Well, and that's what listeners need to know.
[00:22:51.677 --> 00:22:58.158]  If two African-American women get pregnant, one of them for sure is going to choose abortion.
[00:22:58.258 --> 00:23:13.961]  And at this rate, from Alan Guttmacher, who sat on the board of Planned Parenthood and probably has better stats than most at Gluckmacher Institute, he proudly reports that 52% of all African-American pregnancies end in abortion.
[00:23:14.845 --> 00:23:27.572]  Also, what they failed to tell you, of course, as you've already alluded to, and thank God for your work, the health ramifications that are just horrific, which are never discussed.
[00:23:28.232 --> 00:23:41.319]  African Americans now, by using abortion nearly as a contraceptive, African American women now leave the country in preterm death rates of their children.
[00:23:42.165 --> 00:23:48.529]  And it's also been documented that these IUDs they put in women in the 70s, 80s, and 90s were designed to screw up women's uteruses.
[00:23:59.915 --> 00:24:05.057]  The same thing's come up with Debra Povera, that it, a lot of times, really hurts women's fertility.
[00:24:05.398 --> 00:24:09.279]  Folks, you need to understand, and I mean, I've seen all the big studies.
[00:24:09.599 --> 00:24:13.281]  They know it increases cancer risk having abortions.
[00:24:13.621 --> 00:24:13.821]  Yes, 66%.
[00:24:14.002 --> 00:24:25.687]  And it's just outrageous that the NAACP has fought every year since 2006 from this coming to the floor.
[00:24:26.388 --> 00:24:26.548]  Yes.
[00:24:43.246 --> 00:24:47.308]  And it's already that abortion is the most performed operation on a woman.
[00:24:47.848 --> 00:24:54.450]  How can you not allow the information, the health information, especially when it comes to the issue of breast cancer?
[00:24:54.950 --> 00:25:10.176]  And it can be clearly seen by all data that breast cancer basically rose and basically skyrocketed right after Roe v. Wade in the African American community.
[00:25:10.802 --> 00:25:15.579]  So, uh, we're looking for a grassroots, uh, just recently.
[00:25:16.585 --> 00:25:24.687]  It's been a documentary out, my awesome, and being seen at the Thelma Film Festival this Sunday.
[00:25:25.007 --> 00:25:25.528]  Absolutely.
[00:25:25.568 --> 00:25:29.969]  We offer it at Infowars.com, the DVD film, incredibly powerful.
[00:25:30.309 --> 00:25:32.429]  Back in 70 seconds, Reverend.
[00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:34.870]  And again, I've researched all this.
[00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.471]  Everything he's saying is documented.
[00:25:37.011 --> 00:25:40.692]  You need to be as informed as he is, folks, to stop this genocide.
[00:25:43.112 --> 00:25:44.333]  You are listening to GCN.

[00:27:13.447 --> 00:27:17.669]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:22.351]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:24.853 --> 00:27:28.714]  Pastor Clynard Howard Childress is our guest.
[00:27:28.794 --> 00:27:31.276]  Blackgenocide.org is the website.
[00:27:33.677 --> 00:27:34.077]  Pastor,
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.501]  You were getting into abortion statistics.
[00:27:37.581 --> 00:27:54.691]  I've seen hundreds of mainstream news articles from major prestigious research institutions that it causes cervical, that it causes massive increases of cancer in the uterus, in the breast, because it interrupts a normal cycle, and it's very, very dangerous for the body.
[00:27:55.731 --> 00:27:58.753]  And we're sending a crew to interview you about this for an upcoming film.
[00:27:59.153 --> 00:28:01.214]  But this is a fact, and women need to know this.
[00:28:02.575 --> 00:28:08.007]  All the evidence of how they push abortion once people get to the Planned Parenthood facility.
[00:28:08.047 --> 00:28:10.833]  But I want you to continue on any other points you think are most important.
[00:28:11.134 --> 00:28:12.096]  Then I want to get into...
[00:28:13.661 --> 00:28:20.163]  African Americans, black people in this country, but all over the world, need to know that their leaders are worse than Judas Iscariot.
[00:28:20.623 --> 00:28:28.145]  They are there, they are financed, because if the system comes to you and says, hi, I'm a Nazi, I want to kill you, black people are going to run.
[00:28:28.165 --> 00:28:32.326]  But if they come and say, I'm a loving liberal, I'm going to keep you safe from the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:28:32.786 --> 00:28:35.827]  Well, the Ku Klux Klan's pretty bad, but they haven't killed 16 million people.
[00:28:36.287 --> 00:28:49.852]  I found it's the Birkenstock-wearing fake liberal, when you really corner them, they hate black people, they hate life, they hate humanity, they and their green police want to get rid of the majority of the world population.
[00:28:50.832 --> 00:28:51.392]  Absolutely.
[00:28:51.432 --> 00:29:02.196]  Well, especially when it comes to, let me get back to this one health point of view, because people say, well, how does it affect me as a woman, when you say breast cancer, how does that come about?
[00:29:02.796 --> 00:29:04.877]  Well, if you miscarry,
[00:29:05.535 --> 00:29:10.278]  Your brain picks that up and sends messages throughout the body to shut down.
[00:29:11.358 --> 00:29:18.423]  If it's surgically done, or if you have an abortion, the brain does not pick that up.
[00:29:19.303 --> 00:29:24.146]  And it begins to send out impulses to the rest of the body as if you have a child.
[00:29:25.133 --> 00:29:32.219]  And the greatest damage done is in the breast, because by the time the brain figures out there's no baby there.
[00:29:33.079 --> 00:29:34.660]  And that's what the science shows.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.342]  There's a massive hormone flux.
[00:29:36.422 --> 00:29:42.366]  That's why mammals get cancers thousands of times more often than sharks, because sharks don't have hormones.
[00:29:42.726 --> 00:29:43.427]  Right.
[00:29:44.488 --> 00:29:53.975]  And isn't it amazing that Planned Parenthood, the leading abortion provider, does not share that information with a woman coming in for the first time for an abortion?
[00:29:54.945 --> 00:29:56.565]  That is negligent.
[00:29:56.605 --> 00:30:05.788]  That's medical negligence, but yet no one holds them accountable, which allows me to segue over to what, you know, all data proves right now.
[00:30:07.508 --> 00:30:21.051]  And I know this program, just from the few minutes I've been on it, it's been sounding this alarm, and it's very important, that unfortunately, folks, the government is very deep into this eugenics mindset and movement globally.
[00:30:21.751 --> 00:30:42.839]  And so they stepped back a few years ago and picked an entity to lead the charge where they could be basically undercover in their intent and agenda to control the numbers of the world, but especially, of course, African Americans, and they picked Planned Parenthood.
[00:30:43.359 --> 00:30:44.660]  And they get $350 million, $1 million each day.
[00:30:49.485 --> 00:30:59.911]  $350 million of taxpayer money by both administrations, whether it's been Democrat or whether it's been Republican.
[00:31:00.511 --> 00:31:17.940]  And so we find that this is an agenda of elitists that are getting this support from government to continue the eugenic practices of sterilization, abortion, and seducing third-world countries into taking this in as a part
[00:31:18.559 --> 00:31:19.480]  of their day-to-day.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:34.689]  So this is going on and there's only one way I believe it could ever come to a close or to a stop is that for the voices of the people to be united as one and to be informed.
[00:31:35.473 --> 00:31:43.875]  And because it's so massive, it would take a massive movement to address this ill and have the data.
[00:31:43.975 --> 00:31:54.437]  And now this is the day that we do have the data to point out that these eugenics elitists have infiltrated just about every neighborhood.
[00:31:54.457 --> 00:31:55.577]  All right, Pastor, stay there.
[00:31:55.597 --> 00:31:57.017]  We're going to break it down on the other side.
[00:31:57.077 --> 00:31:58.278]  Long segment coming up.
[00:31:58.558 --> 00:31:59.358]  BlackGenocide.org.
[00:32:01.291 --> 00:32:05.533]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:05.853 --> 00:32:09.934]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:10.195 --> 00:32:15.597]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:15.937 --> 00:32:16.397]  It's true.
[00:32:16.677 --> 00:32:21.239]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:21.539 --> 00:32:22.080]  Number 3.
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:25.664]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:25.965 --> 00:32:29.689]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:29.869 --> 00:32:30.430]  Number 4.
[00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:33.053]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:33.434 --> 00:32:36.838]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:37.118 --> 00:32:37.339]  Number 5.
[00:32:37.899 --> 00:32:41.822]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:42.043 --> 00:32:46.806]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:34:34.045 --> 00:34:34.405]  I think so.
[00:35:01.573 --> 00:35:06.617]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:35:06.957 --> 00:35:09.299]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:13.962]  What you've been hearing is not our opinion.
[00:35:14.202 --> 00:35:16.564]  I've never met the Reverend, he's never met me.
[00:35:17.425 --> 00:35:21.768]  His website, Black Genocide, is the same as whatistheendgame.com, or Endgame.
[00:35:22.869 --> 00:35:23.509]  It's the facts.
[00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:27.052]  It's their own writings, their own program, their own operation.
[00:35:28.223 --> 00:35:39.645]  And I just wanted to add that Bill Gates and Oprah Winfrey and others with the Rockefellers, the fathers of this, they've literally funded the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and then Hitler, that this is their program of control.
[00:35:39.765 --> 00:35:41.025]  This is what they're into.
[00:35:41.085 --> 00:35:45.706]  These are the most vicious control freaks you can imagine.
[00:35:46.666 --> 00:35:56.648]  And when you expand on that and you realize that the CPS, it's not enough to kill 52% of the black kids and the CPS takes more black children than any other children.
[00:35:57.762 --> 00:36:01.245]  Statistically, they're five to seven times more likely to abuse children they have.
[00:36:01.725 --> 00:36:02.646]  They then drug them.
[00:36:03.187 --> 00:36:07.470]  The average foster child, more than two-thirds in the U.S., are on multiple drugs.
[00:36:08.051 --> 00:36:10.192]  The average child that's on drugs is on seven.
[00:36:10.993 --> 00:36:12.054]  That's government numbers.
[00:36:12.735 --> 00:36:14.716]  This is about destroying minds.
[00:36:14.776 --> 00:36:17.659]  This is a cold-blooded operation.
[00:36:17.739 --> 00:36:19.981]  And this ties into everything.
[00:36:20.561 --> 00:36:22.943]  Everything always goes back to eugenics.
[00:36:22.983 --> 00:36:25.386]  And I didn't even know what eugenics was 15 years ago.
[00:36:25.426 --> 00:36:29.469]  I've been doing my research, studying the global structure, who runs it, their own writings.
[00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:32.132]  This is what they are obsessed with.
[00:36:32.492 --> 00:36:37.637]  You have the UN saying the carbon taxes are about destroying industrial society, bankrupting people.
[00:36:37.917 --> 00:36:39.759]  Then if you're poor, they're going to take your children.
[00:36:41.624 --> 00:36:48.831]  It's just State Department Random 200, put out by Henry Kissinger, telling the third world, get rid of half your people or you don't get IMF World Bank money.
[00:36:49.532 --> 00:36:50.673]  This is what they're doing.
[00:36:51.113 --> 00:36:59.902]  Now, going back to Pastor Childress of blackgenocide.org, and again, our websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[00:37:00.242 --> 00:37:02.144]  On the eugenics subject, whatistheendgame.com,
[00:37:03.645 --> 00:37:06.727]  Pastor, continuing, this is key.
[00:37:06.807 --> 00:37:17.114]  We know that abortion, even one abortion, massively increases your cancer risk in different parts of the body that are involved in pregnancy and hormones.
[00:37:18.034 --> 00:37:21.416]  We know it causes the women to have miscarriages when they try to have children.
[00:37:22.377 --> 00:37:25.259]  The women are not being told that people would like to adopt those children.
[00:37:25.299 --> 00:37:26.860]  They're told nobody wants a black child.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:30.242]  But again, this is being done to everybody, but particularly black folks.
[00:37:31.242 --> 00:37:41.204]  We've got to get this message out to people and point out this is racist genocide because I see black leaders and every other group are given football issues all day.
[00:37:41.264 --> 00:37:49.466]  It's about racism and how the black leaders are going to protect you and how Hispanic leaders are going to protect them, but it's all run by the same groups.
[00:37:49.526 --> 00:37:51.707]  I mean, how do you sit there and watch this?
[00:37:51.727 --> 00:37:57.908]  I know you fight it every day, but what is it like for you inside to know these people are doing this and have you ever confronted them?
[00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:59.572]  Oh, absolutely!
[00:38:00.252 --> 00:38:01.654]  That's my job right now.
[00:38:01.714 --> 00:38:07.162]  It just evolved, but I picketed the NAACP last July.
[00:38:07.182 --> 00:38:11.969]  I followed them until they bring this on to the floor in discussion.
[00:38:12.029 --> 00:38:15.393]  They will be picketed no matter where they go in their national convention.
[00:38:16.094 --> 00:38:22.359]  I have a friend, Yvonne Yule, who covers the Detroit event that they do each year.
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:27.523]  We are determined that this comes to the forefront of discussion.
[00:38:27.563 --> 00:38:33.807]  We've made some headway recently in the last few years, but it's so ingrained.
[00:38:33.887 --> 00:38:40.192]  It's very much a part of the political system, and they're protecting it like you never would believe.
[00:38:40.713 --> 00:38:45.116]  You have the whole Congressional Black Caucus fought, literally.
[00:38:45.889 --> 00:38:53.892]  And this is staggering that most people would say, well, you can't buy a whole group of people of that magnitude.
[00:38:53.992 --> 00:38:55.912]  Well, I beg to differ with you.
[00:38:55.952 --> 00:38:57.613]  They're a bot.
[00:38:57.633 --> 00:39:09.777]  And they all fight to make sure that this is never—that they are not held accountable on this information, and especially the fact that it's affecting African Americans more than any other group.
[00:39:10.439 --> 00:39:11.059]  In the country.
[00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:27.400]  Thank you.
[00:39:47.273 --> 00:39:50.695]  Just in the interest of women's health, it should be discussed.
[00:39:51.175 --> 00:40:06.161]  And see, when you see leaders, and black women too, black congresswomen, so when you see them refuse, Sheila Waters, when you see them refuse to say anything, there's another agenda.
[00:40:06.301 --> 00:40:07.202]  They have been bought.
[00:40:07.462 --> 00:40:10.123]  They have interests, vested interests.
[00:40:10.603 --> 00:40:14.325]  And I often say, if abortion was not lucrative, it would not be legal.
[00:40:15.098 --> 00:40:22.065]  And they are benefiting off of the blood of African American babies, and their silence is bought.
[00:40:22.665 --> 00:40:34.056]  And so it's up to programs like itself, and especially the community leaders, and especially the church, to continue to sound the alarm.
[00:40:34.717 --> 00:40:39.101]  Our African American leadership, now it's reached the pinnacle.
[00:40:39.716 --> 00:40:51.546]  Because, yes, I'm happy that race was no longer a barrier to the Oval Office, but Dr. King said we were not to judge by the color of skin, but by the content of character.
[00:40:52.186 --> 00:40:58.311]  And now you more or less in the Oval Office have the face of black genocide.
[00:40:59.072 --> 00:41:06.138]  And this is an ideology of Barack Obama, where he is relentless, and that's all that's behind
[00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:14.844]  Reform Bill, the promise he made to Planned Parenthood that abortion would be on demand and that government would pay for it.
[00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:33.435]  And so every taxpayer right now should be... Travis County just passed a law, it's the only county in Texas to do it, where I have to pay for abortions, I have to pay for murdering children, so I don't sell out to the New World Order eugenicists, I don't support abortion, but they don't care.
[00:41:33.495 --> 00:41:38.216]  They're still going to take my money and make me be a party to killing people.
[00:41:39.076 --> 00:41:48.224]  In Austin, Texas, the city that resides in the county of Travis County, and expanding on that, you talk about blood on the hands of these people.
[00:41:48.284 --> 00:41:56.312]  They sell it like it's some wonderful sacrament or a rite or a fun thing, and people get wild-eyed when they talk about
[00:41:57.483 --> 00:42:09.032]  Abortion, but the point is it has its roots in exterminating people and it gives them cancer and you got more than half of the black people never existing being murdered in their wound.
[00:42:09.813 --> 00:42:14.117]  It's maiming and wounding these women and can we put two plus two together?
[00:42:14.497 --> 00:42:21.943]  You got Bill Gates, whose daddy ran Planned Parenthood, always giving eugenics speeches, but he's got special shots for all the African kids.
[00:42:22.203 --> 00:42:23.905]  It's not enough for him that they're killing half
[00:42:24.545 --> 00:42:25.865]  Absolutely, and this is what needs to be.
[00:42:25.885 --> 00:42:28.786]  They're going to be, I believe, a day of reckoning is coming.
[00:42:28.826 --> 00:42:32.307]  But the data now is surfacing in places where they never thought it would get to.
[00:42:50.349 --> 00:43:00.518]  And the college campuses, hopefully, will be the spawning ground for a move of social activism that we've never seen before.
[00:43:00.898 --> 00:43:02.479]  But you have named the players.
[00:43:02.619 --> 00:43:15.170]  You have also named those, more or less, who are literally being prostituted, African Americans that have said, OK, we'll play this game for the dollar.
[00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:16.871]  And look at the power she's given.
[00:43:16.891 --> 00:43:18.332]  Look at the power Obama's given.
[00:43:18.572 --> 00:43:24.577]  I mean, here's Obama massively increasing abortion and pushing abortions worldwide and all of this.
[00:43:24.597 --> 00:43:26.839]  I mean, it's so evil.
[00:43:26.899 --> 00:43:34.004]  He is the 21st century version of the blacks that Margaret Singer went out and found so she could put a black face on her murder.
[00:43:34.324 --> 00:43:34.905]  Absolutely.
[00:43:34.925 --> 00:43:37.467]  That's exactly where I believe he was elected.
[00:43:38.067 --> 00:43:39.409]  And so he got the money.
[00:43:39.489 --> 00:43:43.893]  And people today, they're still about questioning how he was able to raise the money he was raising.
[00:43:44.374 --> 00:43:45.595]  But that's another program.
[00:43:46.055 --> 00:43:49.859]  Four times the money that McCain got from Wall Street.
[00:43:50.379 --> 00:43:51.100]  Absolutely.
[00:43:51.461 --> 00:43:54.363]  So you see here, this is massive.
[00:43:54.424 --> 00:43:55.765]  But we shouldn't be intimidated.
[00:43:56.305 --> 00:44:00.329]  We should continue to, I believe, truth crush the earth, we'll rise again.
[00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:01.531]  Because look at the numbers.
[00:44:02.031 --> 00:44:19.259]  What, 35 years ago when they got, 36 years ago when they got Roe v. Wade through, 55-60% depending on the poll were pro-abortion, they believed it was just a blob of tissue they were lied to, but thanks to the 3D imaging and all of it and the truth, now I see polls of over 70% nationally and growing are against abortion.
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:21.060]  Absolutely, and that's the good news.
[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:30.565]  That's the excellent news, that the word is shifting opinion, and we need that shift to happen simply because
[00:44:31.204 --> 00:44:39.710]  It is going to intimidate the weaker ones and hopefully not going along with this current agenda of the President.
[00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:45.854]  An agenda that basically is just like the words of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
[00:44:45.954 --> 00:44:48.976]  And I still am shocked over those words.
[00:44:49.216 --> 00:44:57.181]  We passed, she said, in fact quote her, but to paraphrase, she said, and this was last year, she said, we passed Roe v. Wade to get rid of undesirable people.
[00:44:57.601 --> 00:44:59.762]  And you bottom-lined it, that's right.
[00:45:00.163 --> 00:45:08.428]  And people should be in just outrage that you mean you didn't do this based on constitutional law?
[00:45:08.808 --> 00:45:12.830]  You mean you didn't study the Constitution then come up with your decision?
[00:45:13.331 --> 00:45:16.773]  Your decision, you're telling me, was based on
[00:45:17.333 --> 00:45:22.235]  An elitist group of people deciding we're going to reduce some numbers.
[00:45:22.335 --> 00:45:25.456]  It was based on ideology, not law.
[00:45:25.856 --> 00:45:28.257]  That is scary to no end.
[00:45:28.797 --> 00:45:33.838]  And to sit there calmly saying it in an interview is even more shocking.
[00:45:34.339 --> 00:45:41.021]  And of course, I never would think the New York Times would print it, but of course they figured they had an in, they had a scoop, and they did.
[00:45:47.944 --> 00:45:58.428]  Nancy Pelosi on one of the Sunday morning shows said we've got to fund abortion because that'll get rid of people and cut the carbon footprint.
[00:45:59.188 --> 00:46:02.510]  They talk about this so much behind closed doors, they're now doing it right out in the open.
[00:46:03.451 --> 00:46:04.091]  It's frightening.
[00:46:04.371 --> 00:46:07.514]  It's frightening that there's still no outrage over it.
[00:46:07.634 --> 00:46:09.896]  And we're going to continue.
[00:46:10.657 --> 00:46:20.585]  My hometown newspaper refused to put the quote in the paper, which we're going to take some legal action, is that they don't want to admit
[00:46:21.503 --> 00:46:42.554]  What we have been saying all along, this is targeted genocide, it is a universal movement of these globalists that you will teach your audience about, and it's important for us to become informed that we then become active in social activism, I believe, because there is a God that we can turn this thing around.
[00:46:42.814 --> 00:46:43.795]  Absolutely, Reverend.
[00:46:44.175 --> 00:46:44.635]  Stay there.
[00:46:44.675 --> 00:46:45.836]  We're going to skip this break.
[00:46:45.916 --> 00:46:46.697]  It's a network break.
[00:46:46.717 --> 00:46:48.878]  We're skipping it so we have more time with the Reverend.
[00:46:48.918 --> 00:46:50.879]  This is such an important subject.
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:56.423]  But I would just say to black folks listening right now, white people, it doesn't matter.
[00:46:57.124 --> 00:46:58.685]  You need to go to your NAACP.
[00:46:58.705 --> 00:47:00.126]  You need to go to city council.
[00:47:00.646 --> 00:47:04.148]  And you need to every week be there and tell them, stop your genocide.
[00:47:04.208 --> 00:47:05.249]  Stop your eugenics.
[00:47:05.369 --> 00:47:05.789]  Stop it.
[00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:12.594]  Because if we could get black folks as angry as they get when a cop shoots some black youth who's unarmed,
[00:47:13.114 --> 00:47:17.096]  I mean, you got 16 million versus a few hundred blacks getting shot a year.
[00:47:17.376 --> 00:47:23.958]  How about instead of getting upset when a cop shoves a plunger in somebody, and that's bad, but it's not 16 million babies chopped up.
[00:47:24.238 --> 00:47:25.739]  We know those babies are innocent.
[00:47:25.979 --> 00:47:32.381]  How about you get as mad about all these babies as you get as some gang person, you know, dying in a shootout?
[00:47:32.401 --> 00:47:35.862]  And that's terrible, but the point is we know these babies are innocent.
[00:47:36.082 --> 00:47:37.783]  How about you get angry about that?
[00:47:38.243 --> 00:47:42.025]  It's a good point, and it's one that I often say, and I keep it in perspective.
[00:47:42.465 --> 00:47:47.007]  I grieve with you on one end, but isn't this not the greater travesty?
[00:47:47.407 --> 00:47:56.712]  Look at the innocent, not allowed to be a partaker of the American dream, not allowed their chance for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:47:57.172 --> 00:47:59.873]  I said, and you stand and say nothing.
[00:48:00.273 --> 00:48:01.694]  This is gross negligence.
[00:48:02.074 --> 00:48:04.075]  This is a great
[00:48:04.762 --> 00:48:05.863]  Look at America, we accepted
[00:48:20.755 --> 00:48:23.476]  Abortion and then the women get cancer from it.
[00:48:23.736 --> 00:48:27.118]  We accept torture and all these wars and we're being cursed for it.
[00:48:27.718 --> 00:48:31.940]  This nation is being cursed by our own actions.
[00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:36.262]  We allow evil to grow and grow and grow and for me,
[00:48:37.262 --> 00:48:53.635]  You know, as a white guy, my number one issue is eugenics, but I can't imagine being a black person out there who goes to all these liberal meetings and NAACP and Republican meetings, whatever it is, and that their number one issue isn't your issue because it's the only issue.
[00:48:53.895 --> 00:49:06.085]  It goes to the heart of who the controllers are, a bunch of murdering racists, and if they'll set up a system to kill more than half the blacks and a big percentage of all the other groups of humans on this planet, what else are they doing?
[00:49:06.325 --> 00:49:07.986]  Well, I've done the research and I know.
[00:49:08.627 --> 00:49:14.090]  Every major GMO food they approve sterilizes the rats and gives them cancer in all the studies.
[00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.851]  Mainstream news.
[00:49:15.751 --> 00:49:21.955]  The hundreds of chemicals they put in the water under the name fluoride attack the brain, give you cancer, reduce fertility.
[00:49:22.276 --> 00:49:24.297]  The vaccines in their own studies do it.
[00:49:24.337 --> 00:49:28.280]  The drug insert on the H1N1 said may cause infertility.
[00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:29.761]  They know what they're doing.
[00:49:29.801 --> 00:49:35.104]  They engineer all of this into what they do and we have a group of murdering killers in control
[00:49:36.665 --> 00:49:39.986]  The football, the pageants, all the baloney has to end.
[00:49:40.246 --> 00:49:43.287]  The media tells black people, get upset about this issue.
[00:49:43.567 --> 00:49:44.407]  And they go along with it.
[00:49:44.427 --> 00:49:46.687]  They tell white people, get upset about this issue.
[00:49:47.048 --> 00:49:51.789]  We have to stop letting them tell us what to get upset about and get upset about real issues.
[00:49:52.089 --> 00:49:57.390]  Get upset about the real issues, the ones that are going to impact you the most generationally.
[00:49:58.010 --> 00:50:05.212]  And unfortunately, we still are afraid to confront our own leadership, especially the African American community.
[00:50:05.672 --> 00:50:16.114]  We will not confront our leadership on how they have betrayed this community, the African-American community, for the sake of filthy lucre.
[00:50:16.154 --> 00:50:26.557]  They have benefited for power, lust, from dollars for their own self-engrandizement, and they have not sought the service of the people.
[00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:31.535]  This is the greatest travesty ever in the African-American community.
[00:50:31.776 --> 00:50:34.860]  The leadership, the African-American leadership is pitiful.
[00:50:36.101 --> 00:50:37.943]  But I'm praying for a revolt.
[00:50:40.146 --> 00:50:41.568]  Well, I absolutely agree with you.
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:46.061]  We are seen as weeds.
[00:50:46.101 --> 00:50:47.162]  We are seen as trash.
[00:50:47.523 --> 00:51:00.135]  We're all being experimented on and they beta tested it in the black community because that was a group that was slaves and controlled and it's going on all over the world right now and it's only getting worse and
[00:51:01.036 --> 00:51:05.557]  People, some of them don't want to believe this because it's so horrifying, but look at history.
[00:51:05.917 --> 00:51:07.358]  Look what other elites have done.
[00:51:07.898 --> 00:51:17.880]  Look at how all the kings of Mesoamerica, Asia, Middle East, Europe, they were always culling their slaves when there got to be too many of them.
[00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:24.402]  And Prince Philip, Prince Charles' father talks about how he wants to cull us, and all these big professors talk about
[00:51:24.842 --> 00:51:26.962]  And now they're saying they want to genetically test you.
[00:51:27.002 --> 00:51:36.764]  They've been taking baby's blood for 37 years without warrants for a secret DNA database at the Cold Springs Harbor eugenics facility that IBM runs in Cold Springs Harbor, New York.
[00:51:38.005 --> 00:51:46.606]  And now they say, we're going to test your blood and we're going to tell you whether you can have a child or not if statistically we say you have a genetic problem, including being aggressive.
[00:51:47.027 --> 00:51:51.387]  So see, they're also going to mislabel and take full control of our reproductive system.
[00:51:51.667 --> 00:51:53.668]  We have to defeat abortion now.
[00:51:54.548 --> 00:51:56.851]  And they'll use that line... I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:51:57.471 --> 00:52:00.374]  Those are the roots of the beginnings of the eugenics.
[00:52:00.394 --> 00:52:01.916]  The cycle is happening again.
[00:52:01.936 --> 00:52:04.559]  I just... I got ready to read that story.
[00:52:04.579 --> 00:52:11.606]  I didn't have a chance to read it, and thank God you're expressing it to me, because that is the terminology that they use, and those are the reasons.
[00:52:12.119 --> 00:52:16.221]  That is the basic root of eugenics.
[00:52:16.861 --> 00:52:26.807]  They begin to determine even what we call feeble-mindedness, what we call violent, over-aggressive, slowful, lazy.
[00:52:27.247 --> 00:52:33.130]  I mean, these are the things that they feel that they want to control, even the behavior of people.
[00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:35.131]  Look at black men in Tuskegee.
[00:52:35.151 --> 00:52:36.792]  Look at our own atomic soldiers.
[00:52:37.732 --> 00:52:44.615]  The government does these tests to also test their own people and create cadres of mad scientists that will follow these orders.
[00:52:45.816 --> 00:52:49.117]  Well, it's scary, but we can do it.
[00:52:49.157 --> 00:52:50.017]  We can turn it around.
[00:52:50.418 --> 00:52:51.278]  We can turn it around.
[00:52:51.638 --> 00:52:54.219]  Well, how do people get you to come speak in their area?
[00:52:54.259 --> 00:52:59.842]  Or how do people read your website, become leaders like yourself, and stop the mass murder in their town?
[00:53:00.362 --> 00:53:05.645]  Well, the good news is that there are people like myself that are being birthed each day.
[00:53:05.685 --> 00:53:22.833]  It seems like I'm getting emails off my website, blackgenocide.org, and if there's an organization or a church or you want to somehow do something to get me out there or someone near in our network to get to you, I most certainly will discuss that with you.
[00:53:23.013 --> 00:53:24.114]  We're seeing a wave
[00:53:24.874 --> 00:53:25.335]  I think so.
[00:53:42.621 --> 00:53:49.624]  Let the African American community know of the agenda of Barack Obama, and I'm going to repeat, 2007.
[00:53:50.184 --> 00:53:56.806]  But, nevertheless, I went unheard, but the website is there, ObamaNation.com.
[00:53:56.826 --> 00:53:58.887]  We're going to upgrade it with some new articles.
[00:53:59.307 --> 00:54:01.868]  You can get in touch with me off of either one of those websites.
[00:54:03.018 --> 00:54:14.407]  Well, we really appreciate the work you're doing because the heart of the New World Order is this wish to be God, to control technology, to use it against the people instead of empowering the people.
[00:54:14.707 --> 00:54:23.614]  And the UN, all these groups state they want a world government with a fake environmental tyranny to control every facet of our lives.
[00:54:24.475 --> 00:54:27.136]  And it's not coming, it's already here.
[00:54:27.816 --> 00:54:32.398]  And if everybody wants to see their future, look at African Americans, look at blacks in Africa.
[00:54:32.718 --> 00:54:35.519]  Some countries, 45% of the people have HIV.
[00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:46.744]  This is all engineered, and if the government's been caught poisoning and killing blacks before, and then all the evidence shows they're doing it again now, abortion, though it's 16 million dead blacks in America,
[00:54:47.384 --> 00:54:49.906]  Is the tip of the iceberg.
[00:54:50.006 --> 00:54:50.766]  It is covert.
[00:54:51.026 --> 00:54:57.230]  If somebody will set up a system to make sure more than half of a race dies, they'll do other things covertly, and we've caught them.
[00:54:58.050 --> 00:55:02.173]  And that's what my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, covers.
[00:55:02.873 --> 00:55:06.315]  People can get the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:55:06.815 --> 00:55:16.680]  And this issue is coming out because it took from the 1850s to the 1940s for eugenics to go through one big wave of evil and people stand up against it.
[00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:18.221]  It then went underground.
[00:55:18.581 --> 00:55:21.323]  It's taken us another 60 plus years to wake up to it again.
[00:55:21.623 --> 00:55:28.647]  But we're waking up to these devils and we're going to run them back in their holes with the help of people like the pastor we're talking to today.
[00:55:29.107 --> 00:55:31.128]  God bless you and I appreciate you for having me.
[00:55:32.554 --> 00:55:33.715]  Well, God bless you, sir.
[00:55:34.095 --> 00:55:35.936]  What if people out there don't have internet?
[00:55:36.296 --> 00:55:44.161]  Let's say we got some poor East Austin black mothers, or Hispanic mothers, or white mothers listening right now, but they want to rise up and get politically active.
[00:55:44.181 --> 00:55:47.823]  Can you send them a packet of info, or how can they contact you?
[00:55:48.403 --> 00:55:55.968]  Post Office Box 157, Montclair, New Jersey, 07042, once again.
[00:55:56.888 --> 00:55:59.690]  Reverend Childress, C-H-I-L-D-R-E-S-S.
[00:56:01.451 --> 00:56:06.212]  Post Office Box 157, Montclair, New Jersey.
[00:56:06.392 --> 00:56:12.614]  We'll also be doing a streaming live program starting in two weeks on the internet.
[00:56:12.734 --> 00:56:14.554]  You can get that off of the website.
[00:56:15.114 --> 00:56:15.455]  All right.
[00:56:15.575 --> 00:56:17.195]  Be able to bring updates every day.
[00:56:17.235 --> 00:56:20.456]  Sir, Pastor, keep up your amazing work.
[00:56:20.536 --> 00:56:22.876]  Godspeed, and we're all praying for you.
[00:56:23.156 --> 00:56:24.557]  We'll talk to you again very, very soon.
[00:56:24.857 --> 00:56:26.697]  Thank you for having me, and you do the same, sir.
[00:56:26.717 --> 00:56:27.278]  God bless you.
[00:56:27.658 --> 00:56:28.118]  Take care.
[00:56:28.178 --> 00:56:28.718]  God bless you.
[00:56:30.273 --> 00:56:33.734]  And I don't want to hear, hey, there's too many people, you know, we got to break a few eggs.
[00:56:33.894 --> 00:56:38.296]  Like Pat Robertson said, what, ten years ago that China was doing a good job with abortion?
[00:56:39.836 --> 00:56:44.798]  Oh, you're against abortion of white people, but you want to kill the Chinese and blacks.
[00:56:45.258 --> 00:56:47.139]  Folks, you're going to be killed too.
[00:56:47.519 --> 00:56:48.399]  Don't you understand?
[00:56:48.439 --> 00:56:49.740]  The New World Order wants everybody.
[00:56:51.821 --> 00:56:52.721]  We're on the march.
[00:56:53.221 --> 00:56:54.822]  The empire's on the run.
[00:56:55.762 --> 00:56:58.443]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:57:01.363 --> 00:57:04.086]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.
[00:57:04.387 --> 00:57:10.174]  Well, here's an unbelievable chance for you to jumpstart your food savings plan from efoodsdirect.com.
[00:57:10.414 --> 00:57:18.264]  Anyone placing food orders on the large volume production run scheduled for the week of March 22nd can get a lot of food for very little cost.
[00:57:18.684 --> 00:57:24.789]  For example, with each pre-production order of three seven-day responders, they'll ship a fourth week of food free.
[00:57:25.049 --> 00:57:27.010]  That's buy three, get one free.
[00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:29.932]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[00:57:30.112 --> 00:57:37.678]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you in this buy three, get one free program.
[00:57:38.078 --> 00:57:40.960]  Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see.
[00:57:40.981 --> 00:57:42.202]  Another example?
[00:57:42.422 --> 00:57:45.464]  Buy nine months worth of food and get three months free.
[00:57:45.604 --> 00:57:50.749]  You've got to go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex for the food buy of a lifetime.
[00:57:50.769 --> 00:57:51.509]  Or call 800-409-5633.
[00:57:51.569 --> 00:57:52.610]  Go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex or 800-409-5633.
[00:58:01.527 --> 00:58:06.870]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:58:08.130 --> 00:58:12.893]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:58:13.273 --> 00:58:20.096]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:58:21.997 --> 00:58:24.198]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:58:26.079 --> 00:58:28.180]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:58:30.499 --> 00:58:34.382]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:58:35.082 --> 00:58:38.265]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:58:38.905 --> 00:58:39.766]  Others don't.
[00:58:40.146 --> 00:58:42.047]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:58:42.307 --> 00:58:43.809]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[00:58:44.089 --> 00:58:46.651]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:58:46.971 --> 00:58:53.235]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:58:53.595 --> 00:58:55.797]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:58:56.297 --> 00:58:58.339]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[00:58:58.659 --> 00:58:59.540]  Others don't.
[00:59:02.262 --> 00:59:05.885]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:59:05.905 --> 00:59:09.288]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:59:09.508 --> 00:59:14.292]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:59:14.312 --> 00:59:20.557]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:20.717 --> 00:59:22.939]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:23.459 --> 00:59:23.759]  Tim Geithner?
[00:59:23.779 --> 00:59:24.200]  Bernanke?
[00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:24.780]  They're arsonists!
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:25.601]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:25.621 --> 00:59:27.742]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:42.372 --> 00:59:49.335]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:59:49.655 --> 00:59:58.759]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:00:09.125 --> 01:00:15.534]  Well, he's Shooter Jennings, a very accomplished musician, songwriter, in his own right.
[01:00:16.155 --> 01:00:20.260]  He plays to crowds of 20-30,000 people, plays with Willie Nelson and many others.
[01:00:20.961 --> 01:00:26.308]  He's got a whole bunch of hit albums, but his new one, Black Ribbons, blew me away.
[01:00:27.369 --> 01:00:28.930]  I mean, eclectic isn't even the right word.
[01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:37.172]  It's like Pink Floyd meets Muse meets, you know, renegade, rebel-type country like his father.
[01:00:38.352 --> 01:00:39.352]  Really amazing.
[01:00:39.693 --> 01:00:42.993]  And it's got Stephen King with intros.
[01:00:43.133 --> 01:00:44.574]  And Shooter originally wrote it.
[01:00:45.214 --> 01:00:49.036]  And then King adapted it, so amazing.
[01:00:49.076 --> 01:00:50.176]  And then Shooter, I'm very proud.
[01:00:50.196 --> 01:00:50.936]  I'm honored.
[01:00:50.956 --> 01:00:54.258]  Also said a little bit of my ideas and things went into it.
[01:00:54.298 --> 01:01:00.520]  It's a radio talk show host who's introducing these, and I've just made a list of some of the tracks we're going to play.
[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:03.901]  We're going to play some of them in entirety, others just in pieces.
[01:01:04.362 --> 01:01:07.063]  There's a little bit of French in there from
[01:01:08.183 --> 01:01:09.864]  Man, it's great to be on the air with you, buddy.
[01:01:28.618 --> 01:01:33.449]  I noticed with this album you're using a lot of New World Order Illuminati symbolism out in the open.
[01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:35.254]  Is that to identify what we're dealing with?
[01:01:35.274 --> 01:01:36.436]  Yeah, a little bit.
[01:01:39.204 --> 01:01:41.025]  I kind of became inspired by this.
[01:01:41.105 --> 01:01:49.967]  I was driving across country and the economy collapsed and I was kind of witnessing all the fear-mongering and all the kind of looming police state issues and things like that.
[01:01:49.987 --> 01:02:07.632]  I really went and started digging and kind of took everything that I learned from people like you and all the people that are kind of making people aware of the kind of globalist agenda and the new world order and kind of put it all into a piece of art for people to take and absorb, you know?
[01:02:08.874 --> 01:02:09.694]  Well, it's powerful.
[01:02:09.714 --> 01:02:10.395]  Who did that art?
[01:02:11.195 --> 01:02:15.617]  Well, the drawing on the front was drawn by a guy named Mike Sportes.
[01:02:15.697 --> 01:02:18.078]  He's a great artist, a good friend of ours.
[01:02:18.938 --> 01:02:36.365]  A lot of the artwork on the inside was a collaborative effort between a fantastic artist named Sonny K and myself, all of who are really into like InfoWars.com and Reality Sandwich and a lot of these websites and kind of information sources.
[01:02:37.046 --> 01:02:37.986]  You know, we're all kind of
[01:02:38.942 --> 01:02:39.923]  Break out of the matrix.
[01:02:55.322 --> 01:03:05.268]  Later we'll get more into Stephen King and how you got to know him and how you guys work together on this spoken word that we're going to hear the intros, quite a few of the songs.
[01:03:06.068 --> 01:03:11.211]  But going back to your previous music, it's extremely diverse as well.
[01:03:11.571 --> 01:03:18.615]  I mean, when did you first start waking up to the shadow government, the New World Order, the social controllers that are manipulating our reality?
[01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:22.698]  Well, I think, you know, I'd always been kind of into
[01:03:23.564 --> 01:03:42.202]  Exploring these kind of facets of the world, but it wasn't until about 2008 when the economy collapsed that, with the two-year-old daughter that I have, knowing that she's going to inherit this place and kind of seeing everything that was going on, I was driving across country, like I said, to go start doing this album.
[01:03:44.774 --> 01:03:55.818]  It was right when the economy collapsed, all I had was me and talk radio, and I would pick up anything from Coast to Coast AM, one of the episodes which had David Icke on it, and I was picking up you when I was driving through Texas.
[01:03:55.898 --> 01:04:04.740]  I was picking up all kinds of different sources of this, and it was really the discussions that were going on just completely frightened me, man.
[01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:08.121]  And I really then, once I reached L.A.
[01:04:08.141 --> 01:04:12.983]  and we started working on this record, I really dove head first into all the
[01:04:13.677 --> 01:04:19.541]  It's kind of information that you and all these sources were kind of trying to get people to wake up to, you know?
[01:04:19.581 --> 01:04:26.665]  And it really infatuated me, and I really wanted to create, you know, I want people to take from the album what they take from it.
[01:04:27.105 --> 01:04:37.652]  You know, it is a piece of art, but at the same time, and kind of a fictional future, but at the same time, it's like all of these kind of prophecies, all these things you guys have been talking about, are all coming true.
[01:04:38.392 --> 01:04:40.354]  And so it's like, you know, we're
[01:04:41.516 --> 01:04:53.372]  People, I just want people to, just like you do, to inform themselves and do the digging and you'll see that there's just a lot of bad things going on.
[01:04:54.195 --> 01:04:59.719]  People need to absolutely not even believe what you or I are saying, but realize there's a bigger world going on.
[01:04:59.939 --> 01:05:01.180]  There's a lot of things happening.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:08.525]  We're at a key juncture in human development and everyone can feel it, not just intellectually see it, but feel it.
[01:05:08.805 --> 01:05:23.676]  Either people are joining more with the dark side, more with the evil, or they're feeling called on a literal quest like child Roland of the Dark Tower came to be part of history on the right side of history for this species and our future progeny.
[01:05:24.346 --> 01:05:25.007]  You're right, man.
[01:05:25.067 --> 01:05:27.410]  Nice Dark Tower reference to do that.
[01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:28.592]  That's a fantastic story.
[01:05:29.446 --> 01:05:30.066]  Absolutely.
[01:05:30.086 --> 01:05:33.227]  Now, I'm going to play a lot of this today.
[01:05:33.247 --> 01:05:37.888]  You were very gracious that I could air it all, but we won't have time, but I do plan on playing more of it later in the week.
[01:05:38.388 --> 01:05:43.129]  Shooter, why did you choose to premiere this, because it doesn't come out until tomorrow, here on my show?
[01:05:43.169 --> 01:05:43.949]  I'm extremely honored.
[01:05:44.389 --> 01:05:45.349]  Well, I'll tell you what, man.
[01:05:45.389 --> 01:05:55.011]  I just feel like that you and your audience are the kind of people that already feel at home with what I'm talking about and are already informed.
[01:05:55.871 --> 01:05:59.092]  I just feel like that this kind of a platform
[01:05:59.913 --> 01:06:02.596]  It's the perfect place for this record to be understood, you know?
[01:06:02.836 --> 01:06:15.390]  So I don't think that there's any other radio program or any other program that I could go on and play this record and the people would know exactly what I was talking about and maybe pull something out of it that they didn't know, you know?
[01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:19.054]  So to me, it's just the perfect match.
[01:06:20.353 --> 01:06:28.283]  Well we're glad you reached out because I'm obviously a fan of you and your iconic father and now to see you on this mission is very very exciting.
[01:06:28.604 --> 01:06:34.211]  We're gonna go to track three which is an intro with Stephen King and what is it how do you pronounce it?
[01:06:36.570 --> 01:06:38.753]  Tristadecaphobia or fear of 13.
[01:06:39.954 --> 01:06:46.562]  And then there's a story, a progression with the spoken word and the songs, a quest within the album.
[01:06:46.582 --> 01:06:48.985]  And we'll talk about the deeper meeting with you coming up.
[01:06:49.465 --> 01:06:53.229]  But here it is, folks, Stephen King introducing Tristadecaphobia.
[01:06:53.250 --> 01:06:54.251]  Here it is, Shooter Jennings.
[01:06:56.616 --> 01:07:11.317]  From the center of nowhere, atop the shoulders of giants, above the creeping fog of disinformation that clouds the American Union, this is Will of the Wisps, and this is the last light radio, your last beacon of truth and defiance.
[01:07:12.722 --> 01:07:24.648]  I've always started my shows by saying that all ships lost in the night search for the lighthouse on the rock of the enlightenment, but good truth seekers out there, the battery is fading and the light is dying.
[01:07:24.828 --> 01:07:30.190]  I see that freedom has failed us and with no light, the night's gonna be a long one.
[01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:35.153]  Woody Guthrie said, this land is your land, this land is my land.
[01:07:35.413 --> 01:07:39.295]  Great words, but this land is their land now.
[01:07:40.728 --> 01:07:52.659]  This will be the last time your ears and my voice will be getting together, because as of midnight tonight, the previously public airways will be commandeered for government-approved and regulated transmission.
[01:07:53.039 --> 01:07:56.062]  The last breath of free speech will blow itself out.
[01:07:56.563 --> 01:08:00.406]  What rises in its place is gonna be the wind of thought control.
[01:08:00.426 --> 01:08:01.887]  Bad guys win, folks.
[01:08:02.708 --> 01:08:14.878]  You know, I don't always play a lot of music on the show, as most of it these days is processed bubblegum, both churned out by the overlords of doublespeak and meant to turn a gray world grayer.
[01:08:15.178 --> 01:08:18.141]  But tonight, I won't go without leaving a message.
[01:08:19.302 --> 01:08:24.426]  Tonight I've chosen to play the one band the American fascocrats don't want me to play.
[01:08:25.007 --> 01:08:27.629]  Tonight I'm going off the air with the music of Hierophant.
[01:08:28.513 --> 01:08:32.495]  For those of you not familiar, you'll get a taste of Hierophant's music tonight.
[01:08:32.855 --> 01:08:34.495]  Their message, their light.
[01:08:35.416 --> 01:08:40.097]  I started you off with Wake Up from their 2009 album, Bohemian Grove.
[01:08:40.778 --> 01:08:42.378]  Their first and most radical.
[01:08:43.119 --> 01:08:46.400]  Remember what the song says, don't let them get you down.
[01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:48.922]  The most important truth is love.
[01:08:49.663 --> 01:08:52.685]  All you know and all you need to know, as the poet says.
[01:08:53.326 --> 01:08:54.287]  What was that beauty?
[01:08:54.487 --> 01:08:55.288]  What's the difference?
[01:08:55.988 --> 01:08:59.411]  Love your family, love your neighbor, love your enemy as yourself.
[01:08:59.812 --> 01:09:00.673]  Go on loving.
[01:09:00.693 --> 01:09:03.996]  It's what humans do best and the one thing they can't kill.
[01:09:04.056 --> 01:09:04.396]  Got it?
[01:09:05.037 --> 01:09:05.998]  This is Willow the Wisp.
[01:09:06.398 --> 01:09:07.759]  The time now is no time.
[01:09:07.779 --> 01:09:09.140]  The temperature is cold.
[01:09:09.561 --> 01:09:10.322]  The news is blue.
[01:09:11.162 --> 01:09:13.004]  But for now, the light still shines.
[01:09:13.764 --> 01:09:16.166]  Off the same album, here's Triskaidekaphobia.
[01:09:16.747 --> 01:09:20.550]  That's fear of 13, my sons and daughters, as in 13 o'clock.
[01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:23.713]  You're listening to The Last Night of The Last Light.
[01:09:37.116 --> 01:09:42.500]  When I check in at 1410, I know what room I'm really in tonight.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:54.707]  Screams from around coming down the hall take me back to a place that I can't recall no more.
[01:10:01.888 --> 01:10:08.012]  The Jack of Hearts will break me and save me from Jesus, baby.
[01:10:08.372 --> 01:10:12.615]  Don't you ever look to your mind.
[01:10:13.035 --> 01:10:18.398]  The Jack of Hearts is aching, so I will not call you.
[01:10:38.203 --> 01:10:38.944]  We're good.
[01:11:05.074 --> 01:11:06.295]  I think so.
[01:11:36.721 --> 01:11:46.865]  That's part of Trixie Decaphobia from the band Hierophant, Shooter Jennings, and of course you heard that intro by Stephen King, the legendary best-selling author.
[01:11:48.626 --> 01:11:54.449]  Tell us about that song, because the lyrics go on for a while, and you're talking about assassinations, aren't you?
[01:11:54.849 --> 01:12:03.753]  Yeah, you know, I was in my studies and all of this, I kind of dug into, I found some interesting pockets of people talking about Diana's
[01:12:04.392 --> 01:12:22.906]  Yes, and you know that they thought it was a murder and that it was, you know, there was all these even further, deeper conspiracies that people had kind of come to about, you know, the death of her grandmother and the kind of that this is almost a sacrificial thing.
[01:12:22.986 --> 01:12:27.650]  Now, whether or not that's true, I think that I took away from it this kind of looming
[01:12:28.597 --> 01:12:41.500]  I was growing more and more aware that everything that people are told through the media is really a complete charade that's set up with a purpose in mind.
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:51.342]  Whether or not Diana's death was intentional or unintentional, the thing that I pulled away from it was it made me feel guilty to know that I didn't know.
[01:12:53.174 --> 01:13:03.220]  The lyrics, the first chorus deals with the Jack of Hearts, which was JFK, and the second one is the Queen of Hearts, the third one is the King of Hearts, which is Martin Luther King, and we just don't know with these figures.
[01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:10.264]  And, you know, whenever someone comes and speaks out with a message of peace and a message
[01:13:11.687 --> 01:13:12.088]  I think so.
[01:13:31.397 --> 01:13:32.898]  Committed these crimes.
[01:13:32.978 --> 01:13:34.800]  I mean, half of them didn't remember it.
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:39.523]  Half of them just, you know, the guy killed... It's the same thing with Sirhan Sirhan.
[01:13:39.563 --> 01:13:40.884]  It's the same thing with McVeigh.
[01:13:41.225 --> 01:13:47.189]  And then they publicly had Jolion West, the head MKUltra doctor, for the years it took him for the trial.
[01:13:47.529 --> 01:13:54.435]  And then when he was on death row and his execution, Jolion West was with McVeigh until the very end, a top mind control doctor.
[01:13:54.963 --> 01:14:00.064]  Yeah, it's insane, man, and it's like, it's such a proven that they've done that.
[01:14:00.104 --> 01:14:01.925]  It's like proven history.
[01:14:01.945 --> 01:14:03.705]  It's declassified, absolutely.
[01:14:03.885 --> 01:14:14.488]  Yeah, I mean, it's just scary, you know, and you just watch, like I saw you on that show, the Jackie Ventura Show, which, because I wasn't sure when I saw that show on TV.
[01:14:14.548 --> 01:14:16.289]  I was like, is this disinformation?
[01:14:16.309 --> 01:14:21.030]  Because I couldn't believe that a major network would run a show about this kind of stuff.
[01:14:21.983 --> 01:14:24.328]  They tackled some very interesting things on there.
[01:14:24.348 --> 01:14:30.500]  I mean, I was watching the Mind Control episode and just, they were, you know, the kind of things they were talking about in experiments they were testing.
[01:14:31.519 --> 01:14:34.620]  Well, I'll tell you this, Ventura is for real.
[01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:41.782]  He set out to find, he thought global warming was real, until he found that it was all a fraud, and that show aired right as all the fraud came out.
[01:14:42.182 --> 01:14:44.083]  The system can't ignore all of this.
[01:14:44.103 --> 01:14:49.925]  They've got to let a little bit of it out now, as a steam valve, and that's even what Ventura thinks they're doing.
[01:14:49.945 --> 01:14:53.226]  But no, that show was done from a pure position.
[01:14:53.746 --> 01:14:56.387]  I mean, I convince Ventura of a lot of it.
[01:14:57.009 --> 01:15:06.255]  Well, I knew when I saw you and Ike on there that I was like, there's no way that you guys would associate with something if it wasn't the real deal.
[01:15:06.275 --> 01:15:11.659]  It was shocking to me the first day I ever saw it because I couldn't believe they would let that on.
[01:15:12.079 --> 01:15:15.422]  You know, at that time, Warner, who owned that company, would let...
[01:15:16.397 --> 01:15:22.740]  Well, they've been trying to cover it up for decades, and so it made it even more taboo and more avant-garde and more hot.
[01:15:23.061 --> 01:15:25.802]  So now they're allowing a little bit of it out there, but just a little bit.
[01:15:26.082 --> 01:15:28.223]  Now we're about to go to another song.
[01:15:28.243 --> 01:15:31.905]  When we come back from break, you'll tell us about the song, Don't Feed the Animals.
[01:15:32.125 --> 01:15:34.887]  Then we'll rejoin with King, more Will o' the Wisp.
[01:15:35.387 --> 01:15:37.648]  We'll be right back with Shooter Jennings.
[01:15:37.828 --> 01:15:40.510]  Shooterjennings.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:42.291]  You can buy the full album.
[01:15:43.011 --> 01:15:46.155]  Starting tomorrow at the website ShooterJennings.com.
[01:15:46.175 --> 01:15:50.240]  We'll tell you about other places to get it as well after this quick break.
[01:15:50.260 --> 01:16:00.912]  We'll also talk about Shooter Jennings working with the legendary Stephen King to write the spoken word that you're going to hear when we come back out of break with Stephen King.
[01:16:01.172 --> 01:16:03.455]  More of Shooter Jennings and Hierophant straight ahead.
[01:16:17.813 --> 01:16:18.174]  I think.
[01:17:31.926 --> 01:17:33.856]  We're good.
[01:18:04.485 --> 01:18:10.190]  As the economy continues to decline, patriots across the nation are preparing for the worst.
[01:18:10.810 --> 01:18:12.632]  The world is changing fast.
[01:18:13.012 --> 01:18:14.453]  Are you fully prepared?
[01:18:15.237 --> 01:18:17.919]  Or will you be forced to eat government soup?
[01:18:18.439 --> 01:18:28.705]  At patriotfood.com, we offer you 135 pounds of dehydrated food and six varieties of canned meat for half price.
[01:18:29.166 --> 01:18:32.708]  And at survivalistseeds.com, we now offer
[01:18:33.849 --> 01:18:39.833]  50 non-GMO varieties of vegetables and over 10,000 heirloom seeds.
[01:18:40.514 --> 01:18:44.777]  That's twice as many as our competition for the same price.
[01:18:45.358 --> 01:18:49.681]  Patriotfood.com and survivalistseeds.com.
[01:18:49.982 --> 01:18:52.344]  Food insurance, just in case.
[01:18:52.924 --> 01:18:57.548]  Owned by me, Big John Lipston, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[01:19:03.138 --> 01:19:06.784]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:19:07.165 --> 01:19:10.170]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:19:10.410 --> 01:19:11.833]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:19:12.535 --> 01:19:15.176]  That we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:19:15.196 --> 01:19:21.418]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:19:21.578 --> 01:19:26.620]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:36.763]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:19:36.883 --> 01:19:38.985]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:19:39.225 --> 01:19:40.566]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:19:40.827 --> 01:19:43.109]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:19:43.289 --> 01:19:45.111]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:19:45.131 --> 01:19:50.215]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:19:50.556 --> 01:19:55.340]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:20:13.956 --> 01:20:16.618]  People like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[01:20:16.958 --> 01:20:20.881]  It's inspiring for many who are affected by the recent downturn of the economy.
[01:20:21.041 --> 01:20:24.964]  I already knew a bit about foraging and edibles, but you take it to a whole new level.
[01:20:25.084 --> 01:20:27.626]  A thousand thanks to you for all that great knowledge.
[01:20:27.886 --> 01:20:28.807]  It was empowering.
[01:20:28.927 --> 01:20:32.770]  When I was in the Navy, I went through a couple of quick land survival classes.
[01:20:32.910 --> 01:20:35.732]  Thank you for being an inspiration and for all the work that you do.
[01:20:35.752 --> 01:20:38.473]  I really appreciate the depth and detail of the information.
[01:20:38.573 --> 01:20:39.314]  Thank you so much.
[01:20:39.554 --> 01:20:42.356]  Much love and respect to you from all of us here in the boonies.
[01:20:42.396 --> 01:20:42.976]  Thanks again.
[01:20:43.156 --> 01:20:45.818]  Knowledge is power and that power brings peace.
[01:20:46.538 --> 01:20:49.540]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:53.342]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[01:20:53.543 --> 01:20:57.885]  You can order online for you and your loved ones or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[01:21:05.546 --> 01:21:12.688]  Written by an author named Carol S. Pearson from the mid-70s called The Hero Within, Six Archetypes We Live By.
[01:21:13.609 --> 01:21:20.311]  Even though it's nearly 40 years old, the book still speaks of the journey each of us takes through our lives.
[01:21:20.871 --> 01:21:26.233]  The innocent, the orphan, the wanderer, the warrior, the martyr, the magician.
[01:21:27.313 --> 01:21:29.674]  We flow between these identities.
[01:21:30.214 --> 01:21:34.716]  They change as the phases of our lives take center stage, one after the other.
[01:21:35.476 --> 01:21:38.698]  Today I feel like a martyr, but tomorrow I'll be a warrior.
[01:21:39.518 --> 01:21:50.124]  For even though my time as the magician is drawing to an end, the innocent in me will continue to believe and hope in love and that the goodness of humanity will prevail.
[01:21:51.325 --> 01:21:59.069]  Here's Hierophant's take on the journey from innocence to experience, which is another way of saying from innocence to orphanhood.
[01:22:00.652 --> 01:22:04.956]  Alright, and that's part, there's more of Stephen King and some of the intros, the music.
[01:22:04.976 --> 01:22:06.238]  We're gonna go out here in a moment.
[01:22:06.678 --> 01:22:12.564]  We got the best for last coming up in the next hour with Stephen King and of course the music of Shooter Jennings and Hierophant.
[01:22:13.004 --> 01:22:15.147]  The website Shooterjennings.com.
[01:22:15.167 --> 01:22:16.788]  The album premieres tomorrow.
[01:22:17.349 --> 01:22:18.170]  Let me ask you this.
[01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:21.613]  What would your father think of what's happening in the world today?
[01:22:21.693 --> 01:22:24.436]  What would Waylon Jennings think about what you're doing?
[01:22:25.134 --> 01:22:29.918]  Well, I mean, it's hard to say, because he passed away, it was right after 9-11.
[01:22:30.058 --> 01:22:41.146]  I mean, you know, he wasn't someone who was very outspoken politically, because I believe that he didn't like to be like a lot of the other artists that'll go out there and just jibber-jabber about it all the time.
[01:22:41.586 --> 01:22:49.652]  But I think, you know, at the end of the day, my dad's heart was in the love of the people around you, and I think he believed that, you know,
[01:22:50.225 --> 01:22:59.493]  That America, at times, have been on the right track, but I definitely feel like he would feel that what was going on right now was a very scary period.
[01:22:59.633 --> 01:23:05.217]  And, you know, I think in some way or another he's heard this record, and I think that he would agree with me.
[01:23:05.237 --> 01:23:19.169]  I mean, you know, I believe that the kind of overall message of this record is about the people that are close to you and how important your family is and your friends and the love and that micro-community in your life, because everything outside of that is
[01:23:20.001 --> 01:23:26.593]  It's a disaster, and it's like, if you can just nurture the things on a small level, I think, you know, that's what's important.
[01:23:26.653 --> 01:23:28.897]  And I think he would have definitely stood by that message, you know?
[01:23:28.917 --> 01:23:30.901]  He would have been proud of it, though.
[01:23:32.165 --> 01:23:32.725]  Absolutely.
[01:23:32.745 --> 01:23:36.126]  Well, I know I'm certainly just proud that you're premiering this here today.
[01:23:36.466 --> 01:23:37.746]  Shooterjennings.com.
[01:23:37.766 --> 01:23:39.607]  The album is Black Ribbons.
[01:23:39.667 --> 01:23:40.767]  It's very eclectic.
[01:23:40.807 --> 01:23:42.007]  A lot of different styles.
[01:23:42.547 --> 01:23:43.888]  I mean, I'm really blown away and impressed.
[01:23:43.908 --> 01:23:45.708]  You're only hearing a small snippet of this.
[01:23:45.728 --> 01:23:53.050]  We're going to play a few songs in their entirety coming up, but let's go out with Lights in the Sky from the album Black Ribbons.
[01:23:53.090 --> 01:23:53.830]  Comes out tomorrow.
[01:23:57.931 --> 01:23:59.131]  Again, the album Black Ribbons.
[01:24:06.271 --> 01:24:07.313]  Tell me that I love you.
[01:24:08.355 --> 01:24:10.640]  Tell me that I need you.
[01:24:11.381 --> 01:24:13.185]  The lights in the sky.
[01:24:13.265 --> 01:24:15.790]  Tell me that I want you.
[01:24:36.178 --> 01:25:00.609]  I've got a happy sense of love As I watch you fall in shadows I am your date You could cut off my waist One for all the days I'm obsessed with you And I'll cover you Can't you read the signs?
[01:25:00.629 --> 01:25:00.989]  Lights in the sky
[01:25:03.212 --> 01:25:05.374]  Tell me that I love you.
[01:25:05.754 --> 01:25:08.017]  Tell me that I need you.
[01:25:08.237 --> 01:25:12.962]  Lights in the sky.
[01:25:13.382 --> 01:25:14.583]  Tell me that I love you.
[01:25:14.644 --> 01:25:16.786]  Tell me that I need you.
[01:25:16.846 --> 01:25:20.870]  Lights in the sky.
[01:25:30.137 --> 01:25:34.839]  We'll be back with the final hour with Shooter Jennings and more of Stephen King.
[01:25:35.419 --> 01:25:36.140]  Straight ahead.
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:43.083]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:43.283 --> 01:25:45.424]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:25:45.884 --> 01:25:47.905]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:25:53.035 --> 01:25:56.656]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:25:56.996 --> 01:26:05.117]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:26:05.857 --> 01:26:09.898]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:26:10.478 --> 01:26:21.300]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:30.943]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:26:31.443 --> 01:26:36.505]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:26:36.865 --> 01:26:44.068]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:26:44.348 --> 01:26:47.109]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:26:54.159 --> 01:26:56.100]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:26:56.540 --> 01:26:58.640]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio.
[01:27:02.002 --> 01:27:04.002]  The night seems so calm, doesn't it?
[01:27:04.782 --> 01:27:06.243]  As if time is frozen.
[01:27:06.883 --> 01:27:11.525]  The city below used to sound like a mechanical ocean moving in giant waves.
[01:27:11.545 --> 01:27:14.205]  Now, it's silent.
[01:27:14.946 --> 01:27:21.248]  No cars, no kids, nothing but transport trucks and men with guns standing on street corners.
[01:27:21.268 --> 01:27:21.728]  What a waste.
[01:27:24.466 --> 01:27:25.506]  Isn't this what they wanted?
[01:27:25.626 --> 01:27:26.726]  What they bargained for?
[01:27:27.187 --> 01:27:29.807]  They create a problem so they can offer a solution.
[01:27:30.387 --> 01:27:34.848]  They scare us, then offer relief, and we fall on our knees in gratitude.
[01:27:35.468 --> 01:27:40.249]  They create a war, promise peace, and we walk into their traps like mice.
[01:27:41.829 --> 01:27:52.291]  From where I sit, I can look down at a big park where I used to watch birds gather while old men played chess and tired women pushed sleeping children in strollers.
[01:27:53.151 --> 01:27:57.234]  Where teenagers used to hold hands and sometimes stop to kiss.
[01:27:58.135 --> 01:28:00.377]  Now it's a tense city filled with soldiers.
[01:28:00.737 --> 01:28:02.498]  There are guns instead of roses.
[01:28:03.279 --> 01:28:07.342]  I can see one armed man clearly and I gotta wonder if he thinks he's serving justice.
[01:28:07.963 --> 01:28:10.925]  I gotta wonder if he truly knows who he is.
[01:28:11.685 --> 01:28:13.547]  Which brings us to our next song.
[01:28:14.267 --> 01:28:14.988]  To you, son.
[01:28:15.508 --> 01:28:21.873]  With your guns and grenades, standing there in all your graceless glory, I dedicate this next song.
[01:28:22.854 --> 01:28:27.057]  Here's Hierophant with Everything Else's Illusion from the Well Wishers album.
[01:28:27.798 --> 01:28:31.481]  I'm Willa the Wisp, you're you, and we're riding the night together.
[01:29:01.636 --> 01:29:11.199]  We're good to go.
[01:29:37.546 --> 01:29:58.444]  Host to host, can't see, can't touch He cracks his hands at working for the kingdom Must he break his back upon it?
[01:29:58.524 --> 01:30:00.987]  He needs that money, don't he?
[01:30:01.027 --> 01:30:02.028]  Gonna eat that money
[01:30:32.964 --> 01:30:36.887]  Well, that was Stephen King introducing Everything Else is Illusion.
[01:30:36.927 --> 01:30:39.870]  And the song goes on and on with amazing lyrics.
[01:30:39.890 --> 01:30:48.377]  When we come back in the next segment, we're going to break down the meaning of the last few songs and how Shooter worked with Stephen King.
[01:30:48.417 --> 01:30:52.061]  Stephen King, who's recently been in Texas, but we'll just leave it at that.
[01:30:52.121 --> 01:30:54.202]  And we are going to work on getting him on the show.
[01:30:54.523 --> 01:30:55.924]  Shooter feels good about that.
[01:30:56.184 --> 01:30:57.265]  Obviously, that's pretty exciting.
[01:30:57.305 --> 01:30:59.207]  But we do have him here today, Stephen King.
[01:31:00.953 --> 01:31:03.155]  We're premiering this information here on air.
[01:31:03.475 --> 01:31:05.677]  Stephen King working with Shooter Jennings.
[01:31:05.697 --> 01:31:08.259]  We'll talk about how they got hooked up together.
[01:31:08.539 --> 01:31:13.804]  We're going to go out with just a little bit of another clip from Everything Is Illusion.
[01:31:13.824 --> 01:31:14.424]  We'll be right back.
[01:31:54.998 --> 01:32:05.481]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:05.801 --> 01:32:09.862]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:10.142 --> 01:32:10.602]  Number two,
[01:32:10.982 --> 01:32:15.546]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:15.886 --> 01:32:16.347]  It's true.
[01:32:16.627 --> 01:32:21.191]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:21.511 --> 01:32:22.052]  Number 3.
[01:32:22.332 --> 01:32:25.615]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:25.915 --> 01:32:29.658]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:29.838 --> 01:32:30.379]  Number 4.
[01:32:30.639 --> 01:32:33.001]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:33.401 --> 01:32:36.804]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:37.064 --> 01:32:37.285]  Number 5.
[01:32:37.845 --> 01:32:41.769]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:41.989 --> 01:32:46.754]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:47.054 --> 01:32:51.078]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:33:01.067 --> 01:33:07.913]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:33:08.033 --> 01:33:09.994]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:33:10.134 --> 01:33:12.256]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:33:12.376 --> 01:33:13.897]  And it's available right now to you.

[01:34:30.885 --> 01:34:40.170]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:34:40.210 --> 01:34:40.950]  This capitalism?
[01:34:41.010 --> 01:34:47.153]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:34:47.273 --> 01:34:48.094]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:34:48.134 --> 01:34:51.255]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[01:34:53.276 --> 01:34:53.597]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:35:01.596 --> 01:35:08.059]  As I've been cleaning up around here, I've been thinking about the ten plus years I've spent talking to you every night.
[01:35:08.099 --> 01:35:13.381]  I've got the original microphone from when I used to broadcast from a pirate station.
[01:35:13.981 --> 01:35:19.483]  Not way up there where the air is rare, but from a filthy basement with puddles of ooze on the floor.
[01:35:20.343 --> 01:35:23.204]  I used to rap into that mic, that's what we called it.
[01:35:23.605 --> 01:35:23.965]  Rapping.
[01:35:24.885 --> 01:35:33.594]  With my damn Uncle Sam button pinned to one side of my chest and the one that said, killing for peace is like roughing for chastity on the other.
[01:35:34.295 --> 01:35:35.536]  Still got those buttons too.
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:39.081]  It's been a great ride.
[01:35:39.801 --> 01:35:42.222]  We could make it through this hard time, folks.
[01:35:42.742 --> 01:35:47.803]  Feel our way through this darkness, but it's gonna take time, and it's gonna cost lives.
[01:35:48.524 --> 01:35:56.546]  Yet the answer is self-evident, like those truths we used to hold dear, and the love of mankind may still come out on top.
[01:35:57.246 --> 01:36:01.808]  Our children's children might still live in a better, more beautiful world.
[01:36:02.864 --> 01:36:03.765]  Do I believe that?
[01:36:03.785 --> 01:36:08.847]  Yeah, with a glass of Jack in one hand, I manage.
[01:36:08.867 --> 01:36:18.873]  This next song is pure nostalgia at this point, harking back to a time when the world economy was going down and we really believed things couldn't get any worse.
[01:36:18.893 --> 01:36:20.734]  Hey, but what did we know?
[01:36:21.574 --> 01:36:26.737]  The cost turned out to be higher than all the government bailouts and stimulus packages combined.
[01:36:27.397 --> 01:36:30.899]  Here's some real stimulus, Summer of Rage by Hierophant.
[01:36:31.559 --> 01:36:32.300]  I'm Willa the Wisp.
[01:36:58.479 --> 01:36:59.525]  We're good.
[01:37:36.110 --> 01:37:37.072]  Yeah.
[01:38:12.028 --> 01:38:18.322]  That summer of rage introduced by Stephen King, Shooter Jennings, our guest...
[01:38:19.386 --> 01:38:21.307]  Very successful musician in his own right.
[01:38:21.347 --> 01:38:22.328]  They just shot a music video.
[01:38:22.348 --> 01:38:23.409]  It'll be out later in the week.
[01:38:24.009 --> 01:38:25.410]  The album is released tomorrow.
[01:38:25.531 --> 01:38:26.871]  Okay, we've been playing a lot of music.
[01:38:27.232 --> 01:38:29.013]  We haven't had time to comment on the tracks.
[01:38:29.113 --> 01:38:32.536]  I mean, talking about the Death Machine and Summer of Rage.
[01:38:32.556 --> 01:38:35.718]  Let's talk about Summer of Rage and the message in that song.
[01:38:35.738 --> 01:38:37.319]  That's just a small piece of it, folks.
[01:38:37.579 --> 01:38:42.783]  Then I want to go back through Everything is Illusion, Lights in the Sky, and also talk about your
[01:38:46.089 --> 01:39:00.078]  Man, yeah, that song is kind of the most direct, I feel like, of all the songs on the record, kind of dealing with the state of the world right now.
[01:39:00.098 --> 01:39:11.065]  I mean, you know, we talk about the FEMA camps and the vaccinations and that song, as well as just the fact that, you know, with all the changes in the world, the agenda is still full on.
[01:39:12.351 --> 01:39:13.431]  We're good to go.
[01:39:42.048 --> 01:39:45.811]  The culture of the world, you know, it's scary.
[01:39:45.911 --> 01:39:52.096]  People sit their kids in front of the TV or are babysat by these little mind control boxes.
[01:39:52.197 --> 01:39:58.382]  And the, you know, the government's preparing for World War, mass genocide.
[01:39:58.442 --> 01:40:04.467]  And there, you know, with these H1N1 vaccinations, they're in every mall and every airport.
[01:40:04.527 --> 01:40:09.251]  And it's like all this stuff is just, you know,
[01:40:09.881 --> 01:40:10.682]  We're good to go.
[01:40:34.266 --> 01:40:45.059]  It really frightened me, and during the process of writing this record, I tried to bring a lot of those emotions to the top, and Summer of Rage is a perfect example of that.
[01:40:45.796 --> 01:40:54.042]  Well, Shooter, that's why I think it's so important that most people get married and have children, because it's biological and it's also spiritual at the same time.
[01:40:54.462 --> 01:40:56.463]  You become a less worldly person.
[01:40:56.483 --> 01:40:57.624]  You become more focused.
[01:40:58.484 --> 01:41:08.551]  You understand that even if you've been worldly previously, which all of us have been to a certain extent, and selfish, that you really are tied into the larger human experience.
[01:41:08.591 --> 01:41:13.875]  When you have children, it starts something biological in you where you do want to make a better world.
[01:41:13.895 --> 01:41:15.316]  I think as you realize,
[01:41:17.284 --> 01:41:24.427]  I know people, it's funny, just the people that I know who have had children.
[01:41:24.947 --> 01:41:26.688]  I was having this conversation the other day.
[01:41:27.509 --> 01:41:31.930]  There's something that happens in you, and it changes everything.
[01:41:31.970 --> 01:41:39.694]  And to me, those are the people on this planet that are going to be the only people on this planet, I feel, that are really going to have
[01:41:40.225 --> 01:41:45.148]  Their head straight for a positive future are the people that have experienced that, having children.
[01:41:45.188 --> 01:41:53.113]  I mean, I'm not to say that there aren't people who don't have children that won't have this kind of positive influence on the world, but I really think it is a giant impact.
[01:41:53.173 --> 01:41:54.534]  I mean, for me, I was the same way.
[01:41:54.554 --> 01:41:55.455]  You couldn't have said it better.
[01:41:55.495 --> 01:42:03.760]  Being worldly and being selfish, you know, and you make, there's almost a certain responsibility to yourself that you don't have until you have a child.
[01:42:04.921 --> 01:42:06.862]  With me, with my music, with her,
[01:42:07.845 --> 01:42:20.533]  A lot of the inspiration, too, for this record was me feeling like I had to be putting a message forward that she's going to be able to look back on and study or just learn from.
[01:42:20.934 --> 01:42:21.774]  I had to be responsible.
[01:42:21.814 --> 01:42:28.439]  It felt fun doing songs about getting drunk and partying, but at the end of the day, that's not what the human experience is about.
[01:42:28.479 --> 01:42:30.660]  That's just things that deter the human experience.
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:32.181]  For me, this whole record was kind of
[01:42:35.703 --> 01:42:40.928]  That emotion of trying to better the world through her.
[01:42:41.989 --> 01:43:00.665]  Let's talk a little bit about Stephen King and coming up later in the hour we have a really long segment we'll have plenty of time but talking to you I guess Stephen King's a fan of Shooter Jennings and he wrote about you or used a character named Shooter Jennings in your book then you reached out to him or how did you end up having Stephen King do spoken word intros to your album?
[01:43:01.263 --> 01:43:10.208]  Well, he had written some really nice things about my music in his column in Entertainment Weekly, and I was always completely flattered.
[01:43:10.248 --> 01:43:15.310]  And then he wrote this book called Micey's Story, which took place in Nashville, and my name is in it, but it's just in passing.
[01:43:15.410 --> 01:43:23.774]  It was like a moment where this girl was in a car, and she was upset, and it wasn't the time for Shooter Jennings on the radio, basically, is what it said.
[01:43:24.415 --> 01:43:30.778]  So I knew that I was on his radar, and when I was kind of creating this record, I had always wanted to
[01:43:31.334 --> 01:43:42.736]  The record really would be about this talk radio guy, and I just had my mind set on trying to reach out to him, and I did, finally, via email.
[01:43:42.976 --> 01:43:45.677]  And like we were saying, I've still never spoken to him or met him.
[01:43:45.777 --> 01:43:53.479]  It was all an email interaction, but I wrote him and said, you know, I've got this album, and I know you're probably busy.
[01:43:53.899 --> 01:43:55.519]  Well, he wrote me back, you know, and he was like,
[01:43:56.241 --> 01:43:56.921]  So nice!
[01:43:57.321 --> 01:44:25.389]  I mean, so gracious, so nice, but he said he was busy, he had a lot of things going on, he was afraid he might not be able to come through, but if I wasn't too discouraged to send him the record and the ideas, and I did, and we just kept emailing back and forth over the period of a couple months, and he was just so generous and cool and gracious, and like, you know, just everything that you would... I mean, he just was just an unbelievable human being, and so here I was with Stephen King on the hook,
[01:44:26.050 --> 01:44:32.293]  And I'm like, oh man, now I felt like an idiot because I'd gotten his ear and I was like, I better deliver with this.
[01:44:32.413 --> 01:44:45.619]  So I finally sent him some tracks and then after a while I could tell he was really into it, but I don't think I was doing a good job of kind of showing him exactly what I meant by the role.
[01:44:45.659 --> 01:44:52.522]  And so I wrote this kind of draft script, which I sent to him and man, like,
[01:44:53.337 --> 01:45:05.786]  You know, a month later on my doorstep I had this package that had a CD with a picture of him in the studio doing the tracks on the CD and the transcript that he had adjusted and added a bunch of great stuff.
[01:45:06.646 --> 01:45:18.114]  He came up with the ending for the whole thing and it was really just a real magical thing and I owe him a lot because it was such a gracious use of his time for silly old me kind of thing.
[01:45:19.551 --> 01:45:20.212]  Absolutely.
[01:45:20.252 --> 01:45:21.532]  We're going to go out here.
[01:45:21.552 --> 01:45:34.161]  We're going to come back and talk more about your interactions with Stephen King and where his mindset is and how you guys came up with this particular talk radio character.
[01:45:35.001 --> 01:45:43.127]  But next, we're going to go out with The Illuminated, just a small clip of that, and then come back with more Stephen King when the radio goes dead.
[01:45:43.807 --> 01:45:45.288]  So stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:45:45.408 --> 01:45:49.191]  Shooter Jennings premiering much of his new album here today, Black Ribbons.
[01:46:40.130 --> 01:46:41.712]  We're good to go.

[01:48:01.966 --> 01:48:04.028]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:48:04.248 --> 01:48:04.749]  March 1st, 2010.
[01:48:04.789 --> 01:48:05.990]  Gold opened this morning at $1116.30.
[01:48:06.030 --> 01:48:09.633]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1146.79, $573.39 for a half ounce, or $286.70 for the quarter ounce.
[01:48:09.773 --> 01:48:10.154]  That's $1146.79, $573.39, and $286.70.
[01:48:21.184 --> 01:48:34.727]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[01:48:34.807 --> 01:48:43.389]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:48:43.649 --> 01:48:44.590]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:48:44.730 --> 01:48:48.892]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[01:48:49.092 --> 01:48:50.033]  Call for your copy.
[01:48:50.053 --> 01:48:50.293]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:48:50.353 --> 01:48:54.896]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[01:48:55.016 --> 01:48:55.836]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:48:57.197 --> 01:49:00.679]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:49:02.861 --> 01:49:06.503]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:49:06.863 --> 01:49:09.885]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:49:10.105 --> 01:49:11.526]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:49:12.228 --> 01:49:14.870]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:49:14.891 --> 01:49:21.116]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:49:21.296 --> 01:49:26.321]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:49:26.841 --> 01:49:36.470]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:49:36.590 --> 01:49:38.691]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:49:38.932 --> 01:49:40.252]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:49:40.512 --> 01:49:42.814]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:49:42.974 --> 01:49:44.815]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:49:45.095 --> 01:49:49.898]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:49:50.259 --> 01:49:55.041]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[01:50:01.266 --> 01:50:04.449]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:50:04.829 --> 01:50:06.650]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:50:07.111 --> 01:50:07.531]  Don't!
[01:50:07.972 --> 01:50:11.014]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:50:11.414 --> 01:50:20.202]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb Kay's number one debt secret.
[01:50:20.522 --> 01:50:24.185]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[01:50:24.585 --> 01:50:27.308]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[01:50:27.708 --> 01:50:34.755]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:50:35.095 --> 01:50:36.076]  Herb K was right.
[01:50:36.276 --> 01:50:39.359]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:50:39.459 --> 01:50:40.480]  What have you got to lose?
[01:50:40.821 --> 01:50:43.944]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.

[01:50:49.330 --> 01:50:49.370]  888-352-7726.
[01:51:02.540 --> 01:51:03.941]  Time's winding down, friends.
[01:51:04.161 --> 01:51:05.922]  The witching hour is almost upon us.
[01:51:06.642 --> 01:51:09.404]  I can't tell you how much I'll miss our night rides together.
[01:51:10.345 --> 01:51:16.248]  When I push back from this mic and get out of the old chair with the broken seat, that's when the sadness starts.
[01:51:16.869 --> 01:51:20.451]  The moon is full tonight, and the silence is rich.
[01:51:21.755 --> 01:51:26.798]  In our time together, we've seen crooked politicians hauled squealing into the courts.
[01:51:27.339 --> 01:51:30.821]  We've exposed toadstool hypocrites to the light of day.
[01:51:31.422 --> 01:51:33.703]  We've even won a victory or two for human rights.
[01:51:34.564 --> 01:51:37.646]  We said, yes we can, and for a while, yes we could.
[01:51:38.479 --> 01:51:40.900]  Sometimes we fought the law and the law didn't win.
[01:51:41.501 --> 01:51:44.683]  But this time, they've divided us so they can conquer us.
[01:51:45.303 --> 01:51:46.504]  Remember one thing, though.
[01:51:47.044 --> 01:51:51.767]  They can muzzle me, but they can't muzzle the love and truth in your heart.
[01:51:52.528 --> 01:51:56.610]  Lies will still be exposed and injustice can still be overturned.
[01:51:57.090 --> 01:51:58.391]  It's not too late.
[01:51:58.951 --> 01:52:01.113]  The truth can still set you free.
[01:52:01.833 --> 01:52:03.094]  Guard the love in your heart.
[01:52:03.614 --> 01:52:04.415]  Guard the truth.
[01:52:05.115 --> 01:52:05.916]  Here's another truth.
[01:52:06.597 --> 01:52:09.231]  Here's when the radio goes dead.
[01:52:36.152 --> 01:52:38.074]  And this song then really builds up.
[01:52:38.174 --> 01:52:39.955]  Just all of it's so beautiful.
[01:52:40.255 --> 01:52:41.957]  That's when the radio goes dead.
[01:52:42.017 --> 01:52:43.818]  It's a six minute track.
[01:52:45.199 --> 01:52:49.022]  We're going to come back and play some full songs in the next long segment.
[01:52:49.322 --> 01:52:55.847]  We're going to go out here in just a moment with all of this could have been yours.
[01:52:56.107 --> 01:52:58.529]  And we're just playing small clips of this throughout the week.
[01:52:58.549 --> 01:53:04.354]  I'm going to play some of these songs in their entirety here for the radio listenership because Shooter's been gracious enough to let us do that.
[01:53:04.734 --> 01:53:05.375]  But Shooter,
[01:53:06.135 --> 01:53:17.999]  When we come back in the next segment, we'll have more time, but a little bit now, I mean, this is really almost an apocalyptic album, and you're going through this story of this talk show host saying it's his last broadcast.
[01:53:18.039 --> 01:53:22.180]  I mean, is this off in the future after the New World Order has come into power?
[01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:29.242]  I think that the place that I imagined when I created this kind of idea for this world was a place where
[01:53:30.097 --> 01:53:38.299]  That it was just the very beginning of that, you know, a place where there was a spot in there that we had that I took out, and I'll explain to you why.
[01:53:38.339 --> 01:53:44.020]  There was something that he said where he said that there was basically a martial law and there were curfews in place.
[01:53:44.060 --> 01:53:54.042]  And the reason I took that out is because I thought if this was in the future and this was the scenario, everyone in the world would know there were curfews, so he wouldn't have to say it.
[01:53:54.122 --> 01:53:55.183]  It would be like exposition.
[01:53:56.883 --> 01:54:13.551]  I kind of imagined this place where it was like a modern American city that had now become kind of populated by soldiers and there were curfews in place because of possible, you know, for our own good kind of scenario that they're doing.
[01:54:13.591 --> 01:54:23.156]  But I kind of imagined it being a little bit pre-apocalyptic, pre the New World Order being in full swing, but it was like right about to take over, you know?
[01:54:25.217 --> 01:54:54.620]  It's really scary to me, the whole scenario of it being like that, it being possible that we could end up with a global kind of, you know, the United Nations could swing in at any time and decide that they're going to, you know, lock the United States down because of dangers and wars, and we've got China and Russia and North Korea and Iraq and all these places that are gunning for us and, you know,
[01:54:55.723 --> 01:54:57.965]  What I feel like we're just baiting them.
[01:54:58.325 --> 01:55:09.873]  You know, the people that are in power are just baiting them because they would love that to happen so that they can then say, oh, we need to lock this whole place down and take control so we can make everything better, you know?
[01:55:10.634 --> 01:55:11.314]  Absolutely.
[01:55:11.355 --> 01:55:15.017]  We're going to go out with all of this could have been yours.
[01:55:15.638 --> 01:55:19.540]  We're going to come back and wait till how this ends with Stephen King.
[01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:21.502]  What happens to the radio host at the end?
[01:55:21.902 --> 01:55:23.463]  That's coming up in the final segment.
[01:55:23.803 --> 01:55:24.424]  We'll be right back.
[01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:26.750]  I don't know.
[01:56:03.427 --> 01:56:03.927]  I think.
[01:56:51.701 --> 01:56:54.663]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:56:55.604 --> 01:56:58.406]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:01.269 --> 01:57:04.011]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.

[01:57:24.947 --> 01:57:26.909]  That's buy three, get one free.

[01:58:02.834 --> 01:58:06.499]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:58:06.860 --> 01:58:09.863]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:58:10.104 --> 01:58:11.526]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:58:12.228 --> 01:58:14.909]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:58:15.669 --> 01:58:21.130]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:58:21.290 --> 01:58:26.311]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:58:26.831 --> 01:58:36.453]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:58:36.573 --> 01:58:38.694]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:58:38.934 --> 01:58:40.254]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:58:40.514 --> 01:58:42.795]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:58:42.975 --> 01:58:44.815]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:58:45.095 --> 01:58:49.857]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:58:50.257 --> 01:58:55.018]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:58:55.258 --> 01:58:59.360]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:59:01.423 --> 01:59:02.044]  Hi, everyone.
[01:59:02.204 --> 01:59:03.065]  Andy Anderson here.
[01:59:03.265 --> 01:59:07.530]  Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties?
[01:59:07.691 --> 01:59:13.358]  In today's world, that's smart, especially with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[01:59:13.478 --> 01:59:17.743]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, good-bye effectiveness?
[01:59:17.823 --> 01:59:19.525]  No more protection until you use it again.
[01:59:19.665 --> 01:59:20.845]  PureWorks to the rescue!
[01:59:21.005 --> 01:59:25.366]  Our FDA-compliant foam, lotion, soap, and spray do not contain alcohol.
[01:59:25.406 --> 01:59:27.447]  Their killing power lasts up to four hours.
[01:59:27.607 --> 01:59:39.489]  PureWorks disinfecting spray is EPA certified to kill swine flu, bird flu, MRSA, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and for our friends in medicine, kills C. diff, along with a whole host of viruses and bacteria.
[01:59:39.629 --> 01:59:40.650]  Moles and fungus too.
[01:59:40.670 --> 01:59:42.210]  It's even safe around pets and children.
[01:59:42.310 --> 01:59:42.930]  Well, they're here.
[02:00:05.481 --> 02:00:08.083]  I locked the door, but I can see them through the window.
[02:00:08.743 --> 02:00:10.805]  One of them is waving at me to shut down.
[02:00:11.225 --> 02:00:12.306]  I'm giving him the finger.
[02:00:12.746 --> 02:00:26.176]  I'll shut down when I'm damn good and ready.
[02:00:29.758 --> 02:00:31.520]  All of this could have been yours.
[02:00:33.083 --> 02:00:35.124]  Now, you got cut off on the last break, Shooter.
[02:00:35.204 --> 02:00:38.965]  You were getting into what this album means, the overall message.
[02:00:38.985 --> 02:00:47.369]  I want to go back over some of the story behind the other earlier tracks, and we're going to play Wake Up, which is your and mine favorite song.
[02:00:47.669 --> 02:00:50.830]  Separately, I didn't know that was your favorite until I saw one of your emails.
[02:00:50.850 --> 02:00:53.091]  In fact, your favorite four are my favorite four.
[02:00:53.111 --> 02:00:56.373]  I mean, it's such amazing music, and it goes on
[02:00:57.433 --> 02:01:00.354]  You can get it anywhere except for Target.
[02:01:00.374 --> 02:01:07.517]  Target's the only place that's not carrying it.
[02:01:07.577 --> 02:01:10.139]  I think it wasn't for any political reasons.
[02:01:10.219 --> 02:01:15.421]  I think it was just they're downsizing their stuff and they weren't sure how it was going to do because it was such a risk.
[02:01:15.461 --> 02:01:17.242]  But you can get it anywhere.
[02:01:17.262 --> 02:01:19.703]  It's going to be on any of the stores.
[02:01:19.723 --> 02:01:21.323]  You can get it at ShooterJennings.com.
[02:01:23.124 --> 02:01:23.944]  Any kind of outlet.
[02:01:24.004 --> 02:01:29.066]  The one thing that's good about the physical copy of the album is that it comes with these archetype cards.
[02:01:29.106 --> 02:01:30.607]  There's like six different cards.
[02:01:30.907 --> 02:01:32.707]  There's one in each package.
[02:01:32.767 --> 02:01:38.449]  And when we're playing shows live, when we're playing a headlining show, we're going to pick a number for every show.
[02:01:38.529 --> 02:01:46.572]  And anyone who has that card on them can come back and hang out with me and the band and have time to talk and ask questions or whatever.
[02:01:46.592 --> 02:01:49.173]  So we're kind of doing a lot of things.
[02:01:50.174 --> 02:01:51.337]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:01:58.942 --> 02:02:00.643]  Well, I can't wait until you come to Austin.
[02:02:00.664 --> 02:02:02.745]  You think you might be at Emo's in April, you were saying?
[02:02:02.765 --> 02:02:03.846]  Yeah, we're looking at it.
[02:02:03.866 --> 02:02:08.070]  I don't think we've confirmed the date quite yet, but I think April, we're going to be at Emo's.
[02:02:08.090 --> 02:02:16.417]  So, you know, if they just stick to our MySpace, which is myspace.com, they'll be able to keep in with the dates.
[02:02:16.497 --> 02:02:19.520]  And you bet, when we come down to Austin, we'll be giving you a ring.
[02:02:19.540 --> 02:02:23.643]  And I think we're going to talk to you guys out of Coachella also when we do that.
[02:02:24.755 --> 02:02:32.139]  Well, that's awesome, because this is not just a radio show, it's also an internet TV show, so we can come down and do a video interview with you about the album.
[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:33.240]  That'd be great, man.
[02:02:33.260 --> 02:02:34.060]  I would love to.
[02:02:34.481 --> 02:02:41.525]  Again, Shooter Jennings, the only son of legendary Waylon Jennings, fighting the New World Order, working with Stephen King.
[02:02:41.865 --> 02:02:45.167]  Stephen King knew about the global takeover back when I was in diapers.
[02:02:45.567 --> 02:02:48.109]  He wrote The Running Man, what, in the late 1970s.
[02:02:48.829 --> 02:02:52.051]  He's got a new book out I haven't read, it's called The Dome or The Bubble.
[02:02:54.613 --> 02:02:55.233]  Under the Dome.
[02:03:23.992 --> 02:03:40.080]  Is all of us realizing that that we are the majority, that we're not alone, and having more people like yourself, Shooter, come out, make a bold stand against MKUltra, the New World Order, the swine flu vaccine, the tyranny, the bankers, the message that's in all these songs.
[02:03:40.460 --> 02:03:41.101]  It's incredible.
[02:03:41.341 --> 02:03:49.525]  You got cut off by the break when you're trying to talk about your whole view of the world we're in a few years from now, that this album is warning people about.
[02:03:49.605 --> 02:03:51.506]  So hopefully we don't have to go there.
[02:03:52.051 --> 02:03:52.631]  Yeah, man.
[02:03:52.691 --> 02:03:57.053]  That's exactly kind of the purpose.
[02:03:57.073 --> 02:04:00.015]  I'm not making anything up.
[02:04:00.055 --> 02:04:06.578]  Everything that was put into this piece of art or whatever was taken from what is really going on in the world.
[02:04:06.658 --> 02:04:11.340]  The things that you've been speaking out about, the things that other writers that I've read have been speaking out.
[02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:13.081]  Even people like Manley P. Hall.
[02:04:13.121 --> 02:04:16.083]  And of course, like I said, I've said about Ike.
[02:04:17.344 --> 02:04:19.786]  Everybody will have formed their own opinion about him.
[02:04:19.826 --> 02:04:28.292]  I'm not an avid follower of Ike, but there was a book he had called Infinite Love is the Only Truth, Everything Else is an Illusion, which is where that title came from.
[02:04:29.072 --> 02:04:31.854]  There's, you know, all of it for what it's worth.
[02:04:32.426 --> 02:04:40.950]  is worth reading once and worth absorbing because there are things, there are messages in all of it that will improve everyone's life on a daily basis.
[02:04:41.050 --> 02:04:48.233]  And for me, the one big message that I received from all of this was the importance of family and spirituality and the closeness
[02:04:49.173 --> 02:04:54.936]  The people around you, because that's the world in which you really, at the end of the day, are going to thrive in.
[02:04:54.976 --> 02:04:59.998]  That's the only thing that matters, because we all know the world is going to go down the crapper.
[02:05:00.018 --> 02:05:02.999]  Like, the sovereignty of the United States has been being stripped away for years.
[02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:08.082]  So it's like, you know, if you're going to live by their rules, you're going to live by your rules.
[02:05:08.162 --> 02:05:10.983]  And the thing is remembering that you have that choice.
[02:05:12.503 --> 02:05:13.003]  Absolutely.
[02:05:13.043 --> 02:05:17.504]  Let's talk about the message of some of the other tracks.
[02:05:17.845 --> 02:05:19.325]  What about Don't Feed the Animals?
[02:05:19.345 --> 02:05:20.325]  What are you talking about there?
[02:05:20.765 --> 02:05:28.908]  Well, you know, that one is, that one kind of focuses on a lot of different aspects of society these days, I think.
[02:05:28.968 --> 02:05:37.490]  And I think for that one, Don't Feed the Animals is really, even though the lyrics are really kind of about me, or they are really about me and Dre, but they
[02:05:38.427 --> 02:05:52.599]  But the nature of it is just the animalistic nature of people and how really, you know, I found myself becoming a night person, you know, if you want to say, like throughout my life.
[02:05:52.639 --> 02:05:56.402]  And nowadays, now that I have a daughter, I'm much more grounded.
[02:05:56.502 --> 02:06:07.091]  But I think with that song, she and I both met in a scenario in which we had kind of thrown ourselves into a more dangerous lifestyle, and it kind of
[02:06:08.482 --> 02:06:24.535]  Dictating that story through the environment and the fact that, you know, the self-culture to America is very dangerous in moments and there's a lot of wild aspects to kind of when you're living in a worldly kind of
[02:06:26.096 --> 02:06:29.098]  It's sold as sexy, but it ends in destruction.
[02:06:30.199 --> 02:06:34.901]  And all of us are weak.
[02:06:34.941 --> 02:06:35.821]  None of us are perfect.
[02:06:35.881 --> 02:06:43.685]  But really, piety, love, grace, that is what uplifts you to a point where you're really awakened and can see what's happening.
[02:06:43.726 --> 02:06:48.188]  And then you see how silly it is to get a bottle of Jack Daniels and drink half of it.
[02:06:48.208 --> 02:06:49.809]  We're not here judging anybody.
[02:06:49.889 --> 02:06:50.769]  I've not been perfect.
[02:06:50.969 --> 02:06:54.151]  The whole point is we're reaching towards something better.
[02:06:54.761 --> 02:06:55.402]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:06:55.722 --> 02:07:06.390]  I mean, I still drink and I still hang out and things like that, but I think in my life I've realized that I was very irresponsible when it came to myself.
[02:07:06.410 --> 02:07:18.419]  Other people I would always be responsible to, but when it came to taking care of myself, I think it took me having a child to make me realize I can't live recklessly because it's doing her a disservice.
[02:07:19.076 --> 02:07:21.659]  Yeah, don't feed the animals, don't feed the troll within.
[02:07:21.679 --> 02:07:24.481]  What about Lights in the Sky?
[02:07:24.541 --> 02:07:26.103]  That's MKUltra-type stuff?
[02:07:26.343 --> 02:07:41.858]  Yeah, that old song, it started out as a love song and it got a little too creepy and it turned into this song that basically, you know, deals with the kind of programmed people of our, you know, even to the
[02:07:42.990 --> 02:07:48.852]  Charlie Manson, those kind of guys in the world, these people that are... Oh, that was definitely staged, yeah.
[02:07:49.092 --> 02:07:58.895]  Yeah, yeah, I mean, so, I think it's, you know, that song is kind of a, from a Patsy's perspective, kind of a... What about Everything Is Illusion?
[02:07:59.295 --> 02:08:00.395]  Everything Else Is Illusion?
[02:08:00.615 --> 02:08:12.079]  Everything Else Is Illusion, like I said, the title came from a Ike book, but that song, now it was co-written by a guy named Matt White, he's in a great band from Brooklyn called Earl Greyhound, one of my favorites.
[02:08:12.691 --> 02:08:13.512]  What book was that?
[02:08:13.552 --> 02:08:14.954]  Oh sure, I've read that, absolutely.
[02:08:33.637 --> 02:08:37.278]  Yeah, so he's kind of my partner in all this.
[02:08:37.338 --> 02:08:45.300]  We have been very into studying all these different facets of secret societies and occult and all these different things like that.
[02:08:47.221 --> 02:08:49.361]  When I had done that song, we had gotten the music done.
[02:08:49.401 --> 02:08:56.103]  Dave Cobb and I, the producer I work with, and Matt was over and I said, hey man, help me finish this song because I have the ending together and I kind of needed
[02:08:56.755 --> 02:08:57.276]  Thank you for having me.
[02:09:05.553 --> 02:09:28.200]  I mean, it's loosely based on this concept, but the first one kind of is, you know, a woman who basically plows through the world on love, and other people's love, and the second verse is about a guy who, and she's continually falling because of it, because she's not, like, she hasn't found it solid.
[02:09:30.400 --> 02:09:33.102]  So the different ways we're bound up in the world's bondage.
[02:09:49.781 --> 02:09:50.502]  Exactly, man.
[02:09:50.582 --> 02:09:57.047]  And that the thing that you're supposed, you know, money and all, and status, all those things, you can nurture those all you want.
[02:09:57.087 --> 02:10:01.030]  But at the end of the day, when you die alone, you don't have anything.
[02:10:01.070 --> 02:10:05.294]  And it's like the thing you need to nurture is the love and, you know, family.
[02:10:05.754 --> 02:10:06.575]  Very powerful.
[02:10:06.975 --> 02:10:07.595]  Very powerful.
[02:10:07.635 --> 02:10:09.857]  Shooter Jennings, what about Wake Up?
[02:10:09.877 --> 02:10:11.318]  We're about to play most of Wake Up.
[02:10:11.699 --> 02:10:14.081]  Well, it kind of does speak for itself.
[02:10:14.121 --> 02:10:15.722]  That was a track that was
[02:10:16.423 --> 02:10:23.746]  With me really going into like a trance state about this, this, uh, you know, how the TV and how they lie.
[02:10:23.786 --> 02:10:27.048]  And I'm watching all the hunger strikes and more watching.
[02:10:27.108 --> 02:10:28.108]  I mean, not hunger strikes.
[02:10:28.188 --> 02:10:28.408]  I'm sorry.
[02:10:28.428 --> 02:10:32.730]  I'm watching all the hunger, like the hungry nation, these people dying.
[02:10:32.750 --> 02:10:36.772]  And there's, you know, they're saying there's food depletion and things like that.
[02:10:36.792 --> 02:10:38.433]  And we know that this isn't the case.
[02:10:38.493 --> 02:10:38.753]  It's like,
[02:10:39.409 --> 02:10:42.651]  You know, they will keep the food and starve these people.
[02:10:42.731 --> 02:10:47.034]  Is this the song that points out there's plenty of food, the earth isn't dying, it's all artificial?
[02:10:47.795 --> 02:10:49.056]  This is that song, yes.
[02:10:49.176 --> 02:10:50.817]  Okay, let's go ahead and play it now.
[02:10:50.917 --> 02:10:52.218]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:52.518 --> 02:10:54.960]  Wake Up by Shooter Jennings and Hierophant.
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:56.501]  The album is Black Ribbons.
[02:10:56.881 --> 02:10:58.402]  Available tomorrow everywhere.
[02:10:58.503 --> 02:10:59.623]  Shooterjennings.com.
[02:10:59.964 --> 02:11:01.385]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[02:11:06.876 --> 02:11:30.734]  That TV in the corner That's their greatest tool
[02:11:35.128 --> 02:11:38.231]  They poison your mind, my child.
[02:11:41.313 --> 02:11:49.401]  With their fear and their guilt and their blues.
[02:11:49.861 --> 02:11:53.124]  They teach you that you're just a number.
[02:11:59.389 --> 02:12:01.671]  As they program you in school.
[02:12:05.788 --> 02:12:18.194]  So by the time you're out in the world on your own You've been trained not to bite the hand of the crew
[02:13:04.089 --> 02:13:05.276]  I don't know.
[02:13:12.917 --> 02:13:21.363]  They'll keep all the food for their fancy oven bellies, and the starving will kill to be fed.
[02:13:22.524 --> 02:13:31.289]  And they'll try to turn me against you, so divided we'll turn to them.
[02:13:31.369 --> 02:13:41.556]  Because anything strong cannot be conquered from without the wolf first being conquered from within.
[02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:21.343]  I want to play more Awake Up with Shooter Jennings, but we're running out of time, unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14:21.484 --> 02:14:27.047]  And, you know, the talk radio character fighting the New World Order on this album, he runs out of time.
[02:14:27.267 --> 02:14:28.788]  And that's another message.
[02:14:28.828 --> 02:14:31.069]  You never know how much time you've got left.
[02:14:31.089 --> 02:14:36.993]  So hug your wife, your husband, your children, and realize that it's that humanity that's important.
[02:14:37.013 --> 02:14:43.797]  And the globalists, the controllers, do want to separate us from our humanity so they can control the planet.
[02:14:44.097 --> 02:14:44.838]  If you're in Awake,
[02:14:45.742 --> 02:14:45.902]  Yeah.
[02:14:46.002 --> 02:14:46.163]  True.
[02:14:58.942 --> 02:15:00.483]  It's true, man.
[02:15:00.523 --> 02:15:02.924]  People are the master of their own destiny.
[02:15:03.984 --> 02:15:13.047]  Between the TV and the newspapers and the things out there in the world, they do a pretty good job of sifting through what information they want people to know.
[02:15:13.107 --> 02:15:18.129]  I get upset at some of these people that talk about how Americans are dumb.
[02:15:18.169 --> 02:15:22.870]  That's one of the biggest things that people try to put out there.
[02:15:23.171 --> 02:15:24.111]  That's why we can't
[02:15:25.613 --> 02:15:36.709]  We're sheep, and the reason why we're uninformed, or we're kind of over-informed in certain ways about certain things, to where they shift the public opinion.
[02:15:37.611 --> 02:15:39.291]  It's really like... Exactly!
[02:15:39.351 --> 02:15:49.033]  We're filled with petty factoids about baseball or popular stuff that doesn't matter, and we have been the major experiment, the U.S.
[02:15:49.073 --> 02:15:53.614]  and England, of the model of mind control now being deployed worldwide.
[02:15:53.714 --> 02:16:04.876]  We were the greatest, smartest, most inventions, and we have now been turned into, in many cases, just like the zombified biological androids, and that's what Wake Up is.
[02:16:05.136 --> 02:16:06.276]  You're saying, break out of it!
[02:16:06.854 --> 02:16:07.854]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:16:09.535 --> 02:16:10.796]  You are in control.
[02:16:10.816 --> 02:16:12.637]  They are not in control.
[02:16:13.417 --> 02:16:20.100]  Bring yourself to a higher level of consciousness and spirituality, whether that be religious or not.
[02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:24.362]  It's really about being in touch with the world and
[02:16:24.838 --> 02:16:27.299]  Even guys like Eckhart Tolle have the right idea.
[02:16:27.799 --> 02:16:30.520]  They talk about, you know, you have to stop and smell the roses.
[02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:35.402]  You have to stop and pay attention to the beauty around you because you let all that go.
[02:16:35.882 --> 02:16:38.704]  You know, people in the celebrity culture, that's why the F.U.
[02:16:38.744 --> 02:16:46.907]  I'm Famous song on the record is really a sarcastic jab at our celebrity culture because it's like that is one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life, you know?
[02:16:47.848 --> 02:16:48.809]  Absolutely, Shooter.
[02:16:48.889 --> 02:16:50.630]  Final segment straight ahead.
[02:16:50.991 --> 02:16:55.474]  We're going out with God Bless Alabama from the album Black Ribbons.

[02:17:22.968 --> 02:17:25.409]  Sometimes it's crazy all the time.
[02:17:25.789 --> 02:17:30.891]  Yet things ain't a dime a dozen.
[02:17:32.171 --> 02:17:38.774]  When you find a good thing, you gotta treat it right.
[02:17:38.814 --> 02:17:43.876]  We're all hope dreamers.
[02:17:43.956 --> 02:17:45.837]  I bet you'll be one too.

[02:19:03.004 --> 02:19:06.651]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:19:07.031 --> 02:19:10.037]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:19:10.277 --> 02:19:11.680]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:19:12.378 --> 02:19:15.039]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:19:15.059 --> 02:19:21.321]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:19:21.441 --> 02:19:26.483]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:19:26.983 --> 02:19:36.627]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:19:36.747 --> 02:19:38.848]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:19:39.089 --> 02:19:40.409]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:19:40.669 --> 02:19:42.951]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:19:43.131 --> 02:19:44.972]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:19:45.252 --> 02:19:50.075]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:21:29.668 --> 02:21:31.529]  Our websites, of course, are Infowars.com and
[02:21:32.509 --> 02:21:33.910]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:21:33.970 --> 02:21:36.510]  I appreciate Shooter Jennings premiering this here.
[02:21:36.530 --> 02:21:41.052]  I know the listeners and PrisonPlanet.tv viewers also do as well.
[02:21:41.752 --> 02:21:45.954]  Shooter, you're launching a new website at ShooterJennings.com.
[02:21:45.994 --> 02:21:54.897]  It's already got a bunch of info up there, but it's going to have a little treasure hunt type thing for people to find out more about the New World Order and the secret societies that rule our planet.
[02:21:55.595 --> 02:21:58.037]  Yeah, there's some devilish digging.
[02:21:58.077 --> 02:22:09.786]  It deals with a lot of different things, but it's really kind of a fun little game that kind of takes you through the four days before this broadcast.
[02:22:10.446 --> 02:22:16.791]  The ending to the game gives people a little bonus that most people wouldn't have if they bought the record.
[02:22:17.391 --> 02:22:18.252]  It's a little fun thing.
[02:22:18.292 --> 02:22:20.053]  It should launch this evening.
[02:22:20.113 --> 02:22:22.976]  We're hoping for an evening launch this evening.
[02:22:24.249 --> 02:22:30.435]  It'll be something that kind of expands the world a little bit and lets you in on his history.
[02:22:30.575 --> 02:22:35.059]  It also requires people to do a little bit of digging.
[02:22:35.646 --> 02:22:37.367]  Now, I don't know, because I haven't asked you.
[02:22:37.387 --> 02:22:39.308]  I'm sure you'd tell me the secret, but can I guess?
[02:22:39.668 --> 02:22:43.930]  Is it more audio from the radio host, played by Stephen King, or is it...?
[02:22:44.530 --> 02:22:47.072]  I'll say that you're almost right there.
[02:22:48.612 --> 02:22:54.435]  Yes and no, but yes, it is something bonus that involves Will and Wes.
[02:22:56.436 --> 02:23:01.879]  And this character, a composite of radio hosts that helped wake you up, or...?
[02:23:02.358 --> 02:23:10.943]  Yeah, I mean, I took a positive of everybody from when I was a kid, listening to Art Bell late at night, and having time travelers call in on the air to you, you know?
[02:23:11.003 --> 02:23:23.091]  I mean, I definitely, during the process of this record, was tuning in to you a lot, and all the things you were saying, and, you know, it's kind of, you definitely had a hand in creating this character, along with a lot of the other people with this culture.
[02:23:24.878 --> 02:23:31.720]  Well, I'm just honored that we premiered it here, and throughout the week I'm going to play some of the top tracks of my favorites, which are also your favorites from the album.
[02:23:31.740 --> 02:23:36.382]  We've got about a minute and a half left before we go out with this final track, The Breaking Point.
[02:23:36.762 --> 02:23:38.603]  Shooter Jennings, anything else you'd like to add?
[02:23:39.023 --> 02:23:41.484]  I just appreciate you having me on the air and supporting the record.
[02:23:41.504 --> 02:23:48.486]  You know, we are getting some friction from mainstream media sources, which I didn't, I have to say, I expected.
[02:23:48.966 --> 02:23:54.271]  But, you know, having somebody like you on board to help get the word out there is invaluable.
[02:23:54.331 --> 02:23:57.413]  So I want to thank you for having me on the air and giving me so much of your time.
[02:23:57.954 --> 02:24:01.357]  Well, you brought up Ventura Show, and he's going to be on with us in the next week and a half.
[02:24:02.338 --> 02:24:08.783]  But I don't know how much I can say now, but once the show was a hit, Top Show on TruTV, that's when they got the friction.
[02:24:09.284 --> 02:24:11.545]  So I think that kind of made it through the radar.
[02:24:12.366 --> 02:24:14.308]  But there's a lot of pressure.
[02:24:14.828 --> 02:24:19.311]  On musicians, on activists, on artists, on movie stars, on TV people.
[02:24:19.551 --> 02:24:21.233]  Because they know the culture's obsessed with it.
[02:24:21.513 --> 02:24:25.476]  And when they see the culture start going away from their mind control, they get upset.
[02:24:25.836 --> 02:24:27.977]  That's why it's important to support this album.
[02:24:28.017 --> 02:24:29.278]  Plus, it's amazing, folks.
[02:24:29.318 --> 02:24:30.839]  I've listened to it like 10 times.
[02:24:31.180 --> 02:24:32.681]  I've listened to it in the car, at home.
[02:24:33.081 --> 02:24:35.563]  I mean, it's just, it's amazing music.
[02:24:35.623 --> 02:24:38.004]  And Shooter, I am one hell of a fan of you, buddy.
[02:24:38.385 --> 02:24:38.865]  Thank you.
[02:24:39.485 --> 02:24:39.866]  Ditto.
[02:24:41.066 --> 02:24:42.908]  You know, thank you for having me on the air, Alex.
[02:24:43.507 --> 02:24:44.287]  Well, thanks for being with us.
[02:24:44.307 --> 02:24:46.428]  I'm going to say bye to you here at the end of the show.
[02:24:46.768 --> 02:24:49.668]  We'll get right back to you off-air shooter, so please hold.
[02:24:50.389 --> 02:24:51.189]  You got it, man.
[02:24:51.569 --> 02:24:52.309]  God bless you, man.
[02:24:52.589 --> 02:24:57.750]  Shooterjennings.com and Stephen King involved, Will o' the Wisp, it's Hierophant.
[02:24:58.110 --> 02:24:59.531]  The album is Black Ribbons.
[02:24:59.631 --> 02:25:00.371]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:25:00.411 --> 02:25:02.251]  Don't forget the free iPhone app.
[02:25:02.651 --> 02:25:04.832]  Using the Matrix system to reach people in the Matrix.
[02:25:04.872 --> 02:25:06.772]  You have friends and family that have iPhones.
[02:25:06.792 --> 02:25:09.593]  Send them the free download link from InfoWars.com.
[02:25:10.393 --> 02:25:12.615]  For the free app, five stars on the Apple Store.
[02:25:12.915 --> 02:25:18.279]  Get the books and materials, support what we're doing, so we can support other great activists like Shooter Jennings.
[02:25:18.739 --> 02:25:31.488]  And I want to say great job to Craig Sadler and Jaron and Matt and Rob Dew, who came up here this weekend to get all these tracks in the computer and cut out some of the French words that were used.
[02:25:31.908 --> 02:25:32.809]  God bless you all.
[02:25:32.869 --> 02:25:33.449]  We're out of time.
[02:25:33.509 --> 02:25:38.853]  Retransmission with key info in that first hour, where I break down just how serious things are.
[02:25:39.113 --> 02:25:40.536]  Coming up right now on Infowars.com.
