[00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.171]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:07.872]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:22.337]  Coming up in about 30 minutes, Paul Watson is going to post an article with some documents
[00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:32.063]  Several of our sources, both known to me, were contacted separately about
[00:00:33.556 --> 00:00:40.577]  Jail facilities being secretly, and that's the big issue, installed inside post offices around the country.
[00:00:41.537 --> 00:01:01.121]  Well, Paul Watson and myself just did some searching this morning and found out that there are actually purchase orders for this and that they have a public cover for it, you know, claiming that the post offices and that the mail inspectors, the postal inspectors,
[00:01:03.975 --> 00:01:11.198]  ...are setting up these facilities for criminal investigations of mail fraud and to interrogate their employees.
[00:01:11.678 --> 00:01:13.278]  So it always has a dual use.
[00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:15.639]  But this is being radically expanded.
[00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:28.404]  And Watson was able to confirm, because I was going off memory this morning when I was contacted with this info, that during the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act, when they tried to force all the first responders in the country ahead of the general public,
[00:01:29.295 --> 00:01:31.816]  You have to make the first responders take injections first.
[00:01:32.796 --> 00:01:46.779]  That they did try to pass legislation to make citizens show up at postal facilities to take forced inoculations for smallpox and other vaccines.
[00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.881]  You saw another beta test last year with the H1N1 hype, where the federal government
[00:01:56.354 --> 00:02:06.742]  lobbied all 50 states and was successful in Massachusetts and New York to have the government come out and say, it's the law, you must take the H1N1 shot.
[00:02:06.782 --> 00:02:09.484]  But the people refused en masse, so they had to back off.
[00:02:09.524 --> 00:02:22.193]  So we know they're really trying to set this precedent, to take our blood at checkpoints without warrants, to naked body scan our bodies, and to now they admit that they lied about it earlier, they are recording your body, they are saving it, they do
[00:02:22.213 --> 00:02:22.894]  Breaking our will.
[00:02:50.037 --> 00:02:55.861]  And so, that's just some of the news and information that we're going to be covering today.
[00:02:55.921 --> 00:03:15.994]  Watson, in the next 30 minutes, will post our story that ties in to the rest of the confirmed FEMA camps, clergy response teams, federalization of police, the MIAC homeland security reports, where almost all the training is to take on gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, returning veterans.
[00:03:18.151 --> 00:03:19.952]  There can be no longer any doubt.
[00:03:20.092 --> 00:03:21.213]  FEMA camps are real.
[00:03:21.673 --> 00:03:23.534]  Our country is one giant prison camp.
[00:03:23.574 --> 00:03:28.216]  The public schools are acclimation centers for the prison society.
[00:03:28.737 --> 00:03:30.138]  Our Bill of Rights is gone.
[00:03:31.118 --> 00:03:32.739]  There is warrantless wiretapping.
[00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:36.061]  There is spying on the American people going on.
[00:03:36.121 --> 00:03:37.101]  It's all illegal.
[00:03:37.862 --> 00:03:40.643]  We have a criminal, out-of-control government.
[00:03:40.663 --> 00:03:43.585]  There can no longer be any doubt about that.
[00:03:47.267 --> 00:04:00.030]  Now, first I want to go through some of the top stories today, and then I'm going to get into just a small snapshot example of propaganda on television.
[00:04:05.766 --> 00:04:09.347]  I can't watch ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX.
[00:04:10.288 --> 00:04:29.834]  It is physically painful, because I am awake, I am aware, I understand their propaganda tactics, and it is demoralizing to watch it, because I feel so sorry for the people involved in the evil, and I watch them enjoying it so much, and being such willing participants in their own destruction.
[00:04:34.551 --> 00:05:02.272]  That's why a lot of times I say no to mainstream media coming down here and interviewing me because just the spirit of the reporters, the arrogance, the chutzpah, the bravado, the satisfied satisfaction that they're a part of the system and they're so self-assured and many of them know the system's corrupt and brutal and evil and they just enjoy being part of it.
[00:05:08.075 --> 00:05:15.158]  Dan Harris is a diminutive Napoleonic individual.
[00:05:15.178 --> 00:05:20.660]  I think against that, I'm only, you know, five, ten and a half, eleven.
[00:05:21.561 --> 00:05:23.061]  But I always, I'm kind of like a chihuahua.
[00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:24.562]  I think of myself as huge.
[00:05:25.182 --> 00:05:27.523]  So I've never really had an issue with not being really tall.
[00:05:28.023 --> 00:05:29.944]  But this guy, I think he's like five-three or something.
[00:05:30.785 --> 00:05:36.167]  And very calculating, very manipulative.
[00:05:37.765 --> 00:05:39.947]  And I said, I know you're going to come down here and not air it.
[00:05:39.967 --> 00:05:42.589]  I know you're getting file footage and lying to me and saying it's going to air.
[00:05:42.609 --> 00:05:46.033]  And I know that you're not going to return my phone calls once you leave.
[00:05:47.588 --> 00:05:48.869]  But I said, come on down here.
[00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:51.372]  It's Nightline and ABC Nightly News both.
[00:05:52.413 --> 00:05:53.074]  Come on down here.
[00:05:53.634 --> 00:05:55.156]  Same thing with Chris Matthews' people.
[00:05:55.937 --> 00:05:57.438]  Same thing with HBO.
[00:05:57.498 --> 00:06:00.421]  Same thing with all of them.
[00:06:00.822 --> 00:06:10.252]  They've all been told, get footage of Jones so that after we bust a cap in his butt or set him up or do whatever we're going to do, we can have something out there to knit together.
[00:06:13.356 --> 00:06:15.297]  But see, I go willingly to the slaughter.
[00:06:15.657 --> 00:06:16.598]  I'm not like you.
[00:06:16.858 --> 00:06:17.718]  I didn't sell out.
[00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:28.725]  I know you think you're beyond good and evil, and this is the way the world's always been, and there's always been an elite, so you might as well just join it, and be part of it, and buy into it.
[00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:32.767]  You are so foolish.
[00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:56.936]  But more and more I've gotten to the point where I don't even want to analyze their evil.
[00:06:57.357 --> 00:07:00.899]  I don't even want to sit here and put it all on display and point out all the facets of it.
[00:07:01.239 --> 00:07:14.669]  I mean, if the public can't see the unbelievable corruption and looting and tyranny that is spreading like a metastasizing cancer,
[00:07:16.676 --> 00:07:17.457]  What's the point?
[00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:31.625]  I mean, for anyone that studied history and propaganda, when you can flip from channel to channel on the news and on dramas and on every other program, and all it is,
[00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:45.629]  Is brainwashing, and demonization, and attacking gun owners, and family rights groups, and homeschoolers, and people that are against GMO food, and people that don't want to drink sodium fluoride.
[00:07:45.849 --> 00:07:47.231]  I mean, that's all it is.
[00:07:48.652 --> 00:07:59.842]  Because if you wake up and stop eating the GMO, if you wake up and stop drinking the sodium fluoride that's giving you cancer and sterilizing you, if you wake up to the vaccines killing you, it's over for these murdering pieces of trash.
[00:08:00.731 --> 00:08:01.733]  They get off on it.
[00:08:01.753 --> 00:08:03.937]  They write textbooks about how they're poisoning you.
[00:08:04.138 --> 00:08:04.999]  They think it's funny.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:12.294]  And they say as evidence that you deserve to die is the fact that they're out in the open and you're so stupid you don't care.
[00:08:15.953 --> 00:08:22.858]  In fact, let me just get to this first here before I get into world stocks and our economy being destroyed by design and what's happening in North Korea.
[00:08:23.659 --> 00:08:26.641]  Because this just illustrates everything.
[00:08:27.362 --> 00:08:28.903]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[00:08:29.343 --> 00:08:34.587]  ABC News attempts to align climate change skeptics with white supremacists.
[00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:42.734]  And then Dan Harris of ABC Nightly News, he says, who was in my office three weeks ago,
[00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:51.829]  He says, oh, and there have already been two groups that have cleared Climategate of any wrongdoing.
[00:08:51.869 --> 00:08:53.951]  Yeah, they've cleared themselves.
[00:08:55.853 --> 00:08:57.174]  We've covered those whitewashers.
[00:08:57.194 --> 00:08:58.976]  You notice he doesn't tell you who's cleared them.
[00:08:59.256 --> 00:09:00.538]  He just tells you they've been cleared.
[00:09:01.567 --> 00:09:02.848]  Man-made global warming's real.
[00:09:03.208 --> 00:09:04.289]  Pay Al Gore a tax.
[00:09:04.349 --> 00:09:04.969]  Everything's fine.
[00:09:05.649 --> 00:09:08.211]  But they imply that you're white supremacist.
[00:09:08.271 --> 00:09:15.115]  I mean, you can go out there and find white supremacist on giant message boards covering any subject you want.
[00:09:16.035 --> 00:09:17.416]  Oh, you don't like salted butter?
[00:09:18.257 --> 00:09:23.319]  I bet they can find a white supremacist, or they can go pose as one on the message board, who's against salted butter.
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.402]  And say, if you're against salted butter, you're a white supremacist.
[00:09:29.356 --> 00:09:32.499]  Oh, look, we got white supremacists that are against man-made global warming.
[00:09:33.581 --> 00:09:34.862]  Uh-oh, they're threatening people.
[00:09:35.622 --> 00:09:46.733]  Meanwhile, they don't mention here that it's the EU and the British government that have called for arresting people like Lord Monckton, myself, and others who criticize man-made global warming.
[00:09:47.034 --> 00:09:48.255]  They want to make it illegal.
[00:09:49.619 --> 00:09:50.700]  They're the ones.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.762]  It's Cass Sunstein in the White House that wants to make it illegal.
[00:09:54.062 --> 00:09:56.124]  They're the ones that want to shut people up.
[00:09:56.424 --> 00:10:00.988]  But they imply that the poor, innocent ABC News reporters...
[00:10:02.369 --> 00:10:06.792]  The poor, innocent, you know, they're all under attack.
[00:10:06.832 --> 00:10:14.976]  The poor, innocent, you know, reporters talking to man with the made-up hockey stick graph and, my gosh, the white supremacists are after him.
[00:10:14.996 --> 00:10:16.697]  You're not with white supremacists, are you?
[00:10:16.938 --> 00:10:19.959]  Well, then you better believe in global warming and pay your tax to the UN.
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.521]  Your neighbor's warning you about fluoride?
[00:10:23.562 --> 00:10:25.503]  Didn't you watch CSI last week?
[00:10:25.923 --> 00:10:28.484]  Those are people that want to nerve gas children!
[00:10:29.385 --> 00:10:30.466]  They're un-American!
[00:10:31.288 --> 00:10:31.828]  Here it is.
[00:10:32.289 --> 00:10:37.933]  The ongoing oil spill crisis in the Gulf is keeping the debate over climate and energy very much in the headlines.
[00:10:38.093 --> 00:10:47.081]  And that debate is becoming increasingly venomous with many prominent climate scientists now saying that they are being severely harassed.
[00:10:48.211 --> 00:10:50.133]  I hope someone gets you in a dark alley.
[00:10:50.153 --> 00:10:57.882]  The FBI tells ABC News it's looking into a spike in threatening emails to climate scientists like Penn State's Michael Mann.
[00:10:58.302 --> 00:11:00.665]  Six feet under with the roots is where you should be.
[00:11:01.045 --> 00:11:03.908]  I was hoping I would see the news that you committed suicide.
[00:11:04.329 --> 00:11:04.629]  Do it.
[00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:08.934]  It's an attempt to chill the discourse and I think that's what's most disconcerting.
[00:11:09.514 --> 00:11:18.059]  A white supremacist website recently posted man's picture, alongside several other climate scientists, with the word Jew next to each image.
[00:11:18.579 --> 00:11:32.066]  To many scientists, however, the most disturbing recent development was a report released by Republican Senator James Inhofe, naming 17 climate scientists, some of whom Inhofe says have engaged in potentially illegal behavior.
[00:11:32.346 --> 00:11:32.546]  Alright!
[00:11:32.566 --> 00:11:33.787]  Some scientists have said that it's...
[00:11:34.147 --> 00:11:34.967]  We're going to come back.
[00:11:35.207 --> 00:11:39.028]  So you notice, white supremacist, Jew, next, Inhofe.
[00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:43.190]  It is criminal that they knowingly lied to get research funds.
[00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:49.271]  That they knowingly, we have the UN memos where they got them to lie so they could get this new global tax.
[00:11:51.052 --> 00:11:52.592]  But hey, what's ABC News say?
[00:11:53.093 --> 00:11:54.453]  You don't want to pay Al Gore money?
[00:11:55.073 --> 00:11:56.253]  You're a white supremacist.
[00:11:56.273 --> 00:11:57.294]  You don't want to drink fluoride?
[00:11:57.314 --> 00:11:57.994]  You're a murderer.
[00:12:00.348 --> 00:12:05.676]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[00:12:05.716 --> 00:12:08.420]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:12.866]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:18.292]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.

[00:13:59.795 --> 00:14:01.316]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.

[00:15:05.234 --> 00:15:07.875]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[00:15:07.975 --> 00:15:09.936]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[00:15:10.216 --> 00:15:11.397]  Okay, here it comes.
[00:15:11.617 --> 00:15:13.218]  But first, the facts.
[00:15:13.518 --> 00:15:15.239]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[00:15:15.459 --> 00:15:17.160]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.922]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[00:15:21.122 --> 00:15:28.506]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[00:15:28.867 --> 00:15:29.487]  Sinofresh.

[00:15:49.472 --> 00:15:49.872]  Mention GCN.
[00:15:50.113 --> 00:15:51.033]  Buy Sinofresh.com.
[00:15:51.053 --> 00:15:51.453]  It works!
[00:16:03.183 --> 00:16:08.825]  The ongoing oil spill crisis in the Gulf is keeping the debate over climate and energy very much in the headlines.
[00:16:09.005 --> 00:16:17.928]  And that debate is becoming increasingly venomous with many prominent climate scientists now saying that they are being severely harassed.
[00:16:19.102 --> 00:16:21.024]  I hope someone gets you in a dark alley.
[00:16:21.044 --> 00:16:28.771]  The FBI tells ABC News it's looking into a spike in threatening emails to climate scientists like Penn State's Michael Mann.
[00:16:29.192 --> 00:16:31.534]  Six feet under with the roots is where you should be.
[00:16:31.554 --> 00:16:34.817]  I was hoping I would see the news that you committed suicide.
[00:16:35.217 --> 00:16:35.538]  Do it.
[00:16:35.838 --> 00:16:39.822]  It's an attempt to chill the discourse and I think that's what's most disconcerting.
[00:16:40.402 --> 00:16:48.949]  A white supremacist website recently posted man's picture, alongside several other climate scientists, with the word Jew next to each image.
[00:16:49.489 --> 00:17:02.960]  To many scientists, however, the most disturbing recent development was a report released by Republican Senator James Inhofe, naming 17 climate scientists, some of whom Inhofe says have engaged in potentially illegal behavior.
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.602]  Some scientists have said that it's McCarthyite.
[00:17:06.664 --> 00:17:09.085]  That is a word that might be quite appropriate.
[00:17:09.485 --> 00:17:25.911]  Senator Inhofe's report was referring to an incident late last year known as Climategate, where stolen emails gave the impression that climate scientists may have been trying to hide flaws in their research, although several subsequent investigations have exonerated the scientists.
[00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:38.640]  Senator Inhofe's former spokesman, Mark Moreno, who now runs one of the most aggressive climate skeptic websites in the country, did agree to an interview, arguing that skeptics have been getting threats for years.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:42.143]  The public is appropriately angry at these scientists.
[00:17:42.183 --> 00:17:48.569]  And again, no one's advocating violence, but it is refreshing to see these scientists hear from the public.
[00:17:48.909 --> 00:17:54.374]  It has been alleged that global warming, climate change is a quote-unquote hoax.
[00:17:54.715 --> 00:17:57.737]  That there's a conspiracy among scientists to sell us a bill of goods.
[00:17:58.038 --> 00:17:59.019]  How do you respond to that?
[00:17:59.479 --> 00:18:00.800]  It's nonsense.
[00:18:01.701 --> 00:18:04.303]  Scientists are hyper-competitive.
[00:18:05.845 --> 00:18:06.846]  Absolute baloney!
[00:18:06.886 --> 00:18:12.111]  We have the emails between the top three institutions in Europe, England and the U.S.
[00:18:13.052 --> 00:18:13.372]  with NASA.
[00:18:15.023 --> 00:18:20.744]  And we have all the heads of these groups making eugenic statements about destroying industrial society.
[00:18:22.385 --> 00:18:24.005]  About wrecking the West.
[00:18:26.065 --> 00:18:43.109]  And we have the UN document, we've written articles about it, we've linked to the UN documents on InfoWars.com, on PrisonPlanet.com, where a decade ago they got together with all the major universities and said, we want socialism, we want world government, this is how we're going to take over society.
[00:18:43.925 --> 00:18:47.581]  I mean, they're on record saying it, but Dan Harris laughed.
[00:18:47.802 --> 00:18:48.084]  He's like...
[00:18:48.973 --> 00:18:59.401]  There are some that say, as body language is how ridiculous, there are some that say, you know, that scientists are working together to lie on this, and the guy's like, that's ridiculous.
[00:19:00.421 --> 00:19:01.922]  Scientists are so competitive.
[00:19:01.982 --> 00:19:02.943]  Oh, really competitive?
[00:19:03.243 --> 00:19:16.133]  For all the tens of billions of dollars of government research funds to fund the fact that there's no climate change, and if there is climate change, it's unnatural, that the Earth never has changes?
[00:19:20.754 --> 00:19:27.696]  I mean, it's just, they couldn't get away with this if the public wasn't so dumbed down.
[00:19:28.497 --> 00:19:32.798]  I mean, do ABC News listeners realize how insulting that is?
[00:19:32.858 --> 00:19:34.259]  How dumb they think you are?
[00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:36.279]  How stupid they think you are?
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.161]  And look at the body language of that professor.
[00:19:43.154 --> 00:19:54.960]  When Harris says, you know, there's some that say you guys are all colluding, and he just looks as guilty as a cat that's been caught with a canary in its mouth going, ridiculous, preposterous.
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:58.982]  I mean, they've been caught red-handed everywhere.
[00:20:00.262 --> 00:20:01.423]  This is a eugenics
[00:20:02.617 --> 00:20:03.178]  Religion!
[00:20:03.198 --> 00:20:17.158]  And then they've got the nerve to talk about Nazis when Hitler was the big vegetarian environmentalist that wanted a world government to exterminate the majority of the world population and was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation on record along with Margaret Sanger.
[00:20:18.305 --> 00:20:19.845]  Then they talk about McCarthyites.
[00:20:20.226 --> 00:20:22.626]  I've got to get Watson or somebody to do an article about this video.
[00:20:23.266 --> 00:20:29.608]  Just a few weeks ago, they had big environmental groups saying, we've tried to pass climate legislation the nice way.
[00:20:29.688 --> 00:20:30.909]  Now we need to get violent.
[00:20:31.449 --> 00:20:32.829]  We need to shut these people down.
[00:20:32.849 --> 00:20:33.750]  We need to arrest them.
[00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:38.651]  Meanwhile, the poor little scientist, the McCarthyites are after them.
[00:20:39.551 --> 00:20:43.092]  Mean Mr. Inhofe, who we just showed you Nazis.
[00:20:43.172 --> 00:20:44.513]  He might be connected to them.
[00:20:45.413 --> 00:20:48.136]  We just showed you what Nazis said on a message board.
[00:20:48.196 --> 00:20:49.277]  Now here's Inhofe.
[00:20:49.297 --> 00:20:54.223]  It's like, oh, the Nazis are bad, but Inhofe is even worse.
[00:20:54.263 --> 00:20:54.944]  Cuts to him.
[00:20:55.604 --> 00:20:58.628]  He's calling for criminal investigations.
[00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:06.697]  Despite the fact that two commissions have exonerated the people involved in Climategate and found they did nothing.
[00:21:09.813 --> 00:21:15.540]  Now, I could spend the entire broadcast every day doing nothing but covering news propaganda.
[00:21:15.981 --> 00:21:21.688]  Literally, every time I turn on the TV, it is unspeakable brainwashing.
[00:21:23.427 --> 00:21:24.928]  But worse than just news.
[00:21:25.028 --> 00:21:25.689]  News is bad.
[00:21:26.089 --> 00:21:27.931]  They know you're in suspended disbelief.
[00:21:28.671 --> 00:21:42.022]  You are not in a questioning, discerning mode when you're sitting there eating your TV dinner filled with sterilents in a plastic-lined container lined with sterilents, which they admit.
[00:21:42.762 --> 00:21:46.665]  They know you're not questioning, so they're just programming, programming, programming.
[00:21:46.885 --> 00:21:47.646]  That's coming up.
[00:21:48.507 --> 00:21:48.807]  We'll be back.
[00:21:50.171 --> 00:21:53.181]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:21:54.103 --> 00:21:56.792]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:03.777 --> 00:22:04.698]  Tyranny is here.
[00:22:05.039 --> 00:22:08.723]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:22:08.763 --> 00:22:11.165]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:22:11.185 --> 00:22:16.671]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:22:17.072 --> 00:22:23.299]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:22:23.719 --> 00:22:29.262]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:22:29.702 --> 00:22:33.384]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:22:33.884 --> 00:22:37.886]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:22:38.166 --> 00:22:43.689]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:22:44.109 --> 00:22:47.090]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:22:47.671 --> 00:22:49.091]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:22:49.652 --> 00:22:50.072]  It's here.

[00:23:00.114 --> 00:23:02.715]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:23:03.115 --> 00:23:08.097]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:23:08.457 --> 00:23:10.197]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:23:10.497 --> 00:23:15.318]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:23:15.498 --> 00:23:16.459]  How much do you want?
[00:23:16.679 --> 00:23:17.419]  When do you want it?
[00:23:17.799 --> 00:23:19.400]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.501]  When will you need it?
[00:23:20.761 --> 00:23:22.823]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:23:22.963 --> 00:23:24.064]  Will there be any food?
[00:23:24.304 --> 00:23:25.625]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:23:25.825 --> 00:23:30.888]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:23:31.089 --> 00:23:34.231]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:23:34.671 --> 00:23:38.173]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:23:38.493 --> 00:23:39.473]  How much will you need?
[00:23:39.713 --> 00:23:40.333]  We don't know.
[00:23:40.614 --> 00:23:41.534]  How much do you want?
[00:23:41.734 --> 00:23:42.454]  All you can get.
[00:23:42.654 --> 00:23:43.495]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:23:43.755 --> 00:23:46.516]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:24:52.667 --> 00:24:55.229]  H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N.com.
[00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:56.310]  Check them out today.
[00:25:08.846 --> 00:25:11.207]  Okay, we're live, ladies and gentlemen, here on the radio.
[00:25:11.988 --> 00:25:13.889]  Tuesday, the 25th day of May, 2010.
[00:25:14.309 --> 00:25:17.451]  We're also simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:25:17.511 --> 00:25:21.293]  If you just joined us and want to watch the show, not just listen to it, go over to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:25:25.538 --> 00:25:40.983]  You know, instead of just analyzing propaganda that's in the news, the newspapers, non-fiction, fiction is where it's really at because they know you're not paying attention, you go to see a movie, you watch a television show, to forget about the real world.
[00:25:41.523 --> 00:25:42.704]  But then you're being bombarded.
[00:25:42.744 --> 00:25:44.144]  Let me just explain to new listeners.
[00:25:45.264 --> 00:25:52.967]  Soviet Russia, Communist China, Hitler's Germany, oppressive societies have state-run media.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:26:06.487]  But here we have something even worse, something out of East Germany, where you have private media, but it's basically all bought and paid for, with what I call propaganda placement, not just product placement.
[00:26:06.888 --> 00:26:17.314]  Now the media has given it its own term, and admitting, oh, NBC's biggest advertising is the government, and it is behavior placement.
[00:26:19.653 --> 00:26:28.976]  And they admit, BP comes to them and says, we'll run BP commercials and spend all this money if you add behavior placement in this show pushing for a carbon tax.
[00:26:29.717 --> 00:26:30.697]  This is all admitted.
[00:26:31.237 --> 00:26:32.397]  The denial is over.
[00:26:33.898 --> 00:26:42.661]  Steve Watson has a great article where he breaks down the White House bragging that they've now taken complete control of ABC, NBC, and CBS.
[00:26:43.842 --> 00:26:46.162]  The government is now in open control.
[00:26:46.482 --> 00:26:47.283]  Remember Gore Vidal?
[00:26:48.317 --> 00:26:55.500]  Eight years ago, right after 9-11, went on CNN and said, well, I just want to say, but he said an army colonel telling me what I couldn't say.
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:58.021]  Cy Hersh has said the same thing.
[00:26:58.362 --> 00:27:00.222]  These are Pentagon run.
[00:27:00.463 --> 00:27:05.385]  When you're at Fox News or CNN or CBS, it is Pentagon run.
[00:27:05.405 --> 00:27:09.807]  These are government organs now.
[00:27:11.863 --> 00:27:14.424]  I don't know how conspiracy theory got on TruTV.
[00:27:15.345 --> 00:27:24.769]  I guess they just think it's in the corner of television somewhere and it's mixed in with other programming and... I'll talk to Ventura about that next time he's on because he's marveling.
[00:27:24.829 --> 00:27:25.829]  He didn't think it would air.
[00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:30.011]  But I think because of the sensational angle the establishment thinks it's alright.
[00:27:31.152 --> 00:27:31.712]  I'm not sure.
[00:27:32.212 --> 00:27:37.735]  The point is CBS propaganda placement conspiracy theories are anti-American domestic terrorists.
[00:27:39.492 --> 00:27:48.077]  And I ended up last night watching almost the entire 44-minute show, 15 minutes or ads, online.
[00:27:51.846 --> 00:27:57.850]  And you can randomly watch N24, CSI, any show, it's the same thing.
[00:27:58.411 --> 00:28:00.733]  Every episode, people that homeschool are terrorists.
[00:28:01.033 --> 00:28:02.974]  Or people that don't take vaccines are terrorists.
[00:28:03.314 --> 00:28:05.316]  Or people that aren't for abortion are terrorists.
[00:28:05.576 --> 00:28:07.818]  Or people that don't want fluoride in their water are terrorists.
[00:28:08.038 --> 00:28:09.879]  People who are against GMO are terrorists.
[00:28:10.019 --> 00:28:12.121]  Or the mother doesn't vaccinate and her kid dies.
[00:28:16.761 --> 00:28:21.864]  Or, they're homeschoolers and they torture their kids, but the CPS comes and saves them.
[00:28:22.204 --> 00:28:24.325]  I mean, it's just wall to wall.
[00:28:24.925 --> 00:28:32.629]  Folks, sometimes I'll randomly turn the TV on at night, and just randomly surf to a drama or sitcom, and it's just all brainwashing.
[00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:38.372]  That is 100% proof of the evil of our government, the evil of our media.
[00:28:39.898 --> 00:28:50.946]  And that's why you have Cass Sunstein and Elena Kagan and all these other White House czars and solicitor generals and the rest of them openly saying, we're going to shut down freedom on the internet.
[00:28:51.466 --> 00:28:53.227]  We're going to shut down Alex Jones.
[00:28:53.267 --> 00:28:54.508]  There's open calls for it.
[00:28:54.528 --> 00:29:04.795]  ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, New York Times, time to ban freedom of speech, time to shut down these conspiracy theorists, time to ban people that say global warming isn't real.
[00:29:05.035 --> 00:29:07.077]  Because we're kicking their butts.
[00:29:09.144 --> 00:29:10.705]  We are smashing these people.
[00:29:11.086 --> 00:29:17.310]  We are exposing them at every level and they know it and they can't stand it.
[00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:20.132]  They are scared of what we're able to do together.
[00:29:20.493 --> 00:29:25.576]  They know that the people are rising up and getting informed and getting involved and waking up to what's happening.
[00:29:26.377 --> 00:29:32.782]  It is so vital for each and every one of you individually to reach out like an intervention, like they're a heroin addict.
[00:29:33.283 --> 00:29:40.929]  To go knock on that old lady's door next door and sit there and watch TV with her and drink tea or whatever and point out propaganda on television.
[00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:43.791]  To talk to your boss, your neighbor.
[00:29:44.032 --> 00:29:45.072]  To show people!
[00:29:45.773 --> 00:29:49.436]  You can watch any show and there's an anti-American agenda.
[00:29:50.157 --> 00:29:51.738]  This isn't a free society!
[00:29:52.118 --> 00:29:54.120]  We're just marinating and brainwashing!
[00:29:55.545 --> 00:29:56.925]  Now, let's go ahead and go to this piece.
[00:29:57.586 --> 00:30:07.288]  You've got the one woman in it who thinks the professor's okay, but Gary Sinise, you know, the cool male leader type, he says, look, this guy's anti-American.
[00:30:07.328 --> 00:30:09.669]  He believes in chemtrails, which they now have declassified.
[00:30:09.689 --> 00:30:13.510]  The White House science admits there's a secret program to alter the atmosphere.
[00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:16.511]  He gives Associated Press press conferences.
[00:30:17.351 --> 00:30:19.972]  But see, they know you're not watching AP press conferences, folks.
[00:30:20.987 --> 00:30:26.031]  They know, and then he's even more un-American, he thinks fluoride's bad in the water.
[00:30:26.951 --> 00:30:27.492]  Imagine!
[00:30:28.672 --> 00:30:43.082]  If anybody had common sense, it'd be like if you traveled to the old Soviet Union, say in the seventies, and you could speak Russian, and you were in a hotel watching their news, and they had some ridiculous propaganda.
[00:30:43.122 --> 00:30:45.224]  It's how ridiculous the propaganda is!
[00:30:45.484 --> 00:30:46.805]  It's like Monty Python!
[00:30:47.125 --> 00:30:48.146]  It's like Brazil!
[00:30:48.226 --> 00:30:49.387]  You know, the movie Brazil.
[00:30:50.691 --> 00:30:51.512]  With a futuristic 1984.
[00:30:51.572 --> 00:30:54.534]  With Robert De Niro in it.
[00:30:55.455 --> 00:30:57.897]  I mean, it's like absurdist!
[00:30:59.699 --> 00:31:01.521]  Oh, look, he thinks fluoride's bad in the water.
[00:31:01.841 --> 00:31:02.902]  He's anti-American.
[00:31:03.483 --> 00:31:04.964]  Oh, look, he wants the nerve gas, you know.
[00:31:07.786 --> 00:31:10.429]  I mean, folks, they think you are idiots.
[00:31:12.531 --> 00:31:14.653]  And I know I keep marveling hour after hour on this.
[00:31:15.013 --> 00:31:16.054]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:31:19.542 --> 00:31:20.443]  It's every show!
[00:31:20.463 --> 00:31:21.545]  It's pure brainwashing!
[00:31:22.867 --> 00:31:24.108]  Every stinkin' show!
[00:31:24.128 --> 00:31:26.311]  In fact, others should do it.
[00:31:26.331 --> 00:31:32.961]  I've talked for a decade about making a film about propaganda, just showing the overt demonization of anyone for liberty or freedom.
[00:31:33.241 --> 00:31:34.723]  But imagine turning on Russian TV...
[00:31:36.411 --> 00:31:42.413]  Thirty years ago and them saying, anyone who talks about a right to private property is evil terrorist that wants to kill you.
[00:31:42.913 --> 00:31:47.974]  Anyone that says us putting chemicals in the water is a terrorist.
[00:31:48.894 --> 00:31:50.815]  The Russians weren't even that ridiculous.
[00:31:52.815 --> 00:31:57.037]  Only in America do you turn it on and it goes, this guy's some kind of terrorist, un-American.
[00:31:57.317 --> 00:31:58.537]  He thinks fluoride's bad.
[00:31:58.777 --> 00:32:01.118]  The lady's like, come on, he's just a little eccentric.
[00:32:01.458 --> 00:32:04.199]  Then the other person says, he got in trouble in college for teaching it.
[00:32:04.499 --> 00:32:05.279]  The message is,
[00:32:06.741 --> 00:32:09.743]  You better not criticize fluoride or you'll lose your job.
[00:32:10.543 --> 00:32:16.567]  So there's a message to scare you, because they know people all over... Folks, I've read mainstream news articles on air.
[00:32:16.807 --> 00:32:21.690]  Texas Monthly writer was making fun of me about fluoride in the water.
[00:32:23.951 --> 00:32:24.812]  But he was for real.
[00:32:24.852 --> 00:32:25.953]  He wasn't an evil demon.
[00:32:26.553 --> 00:32:28.975]  Because he'd exposed police framing people in Texas.
[00:32:29.595 --> 00:32:30.315]  I assessed him.
[00:32:30.736 --> 00:32:32.697]  I did the interview, the multiple interviews.
[00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:35.693]  I hadn't checked into his family.
[00:32:35.754 --> 00:32:39.144]  I later found out his wife works for the city of Austin in the water system.
[00:32:40.578 --> 00:32:44.900]  That's why he got really upset when I said sodium fluoride's causing bone cancer, attacking every organ.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:33:04.832]  I emailed him the congressional hearings, I emailed him the report, where 90 plus percent of EPA scientists, as well as a bunch of FDA scientists, sent letters saying we, hundreds of chemicals are put in the water under the name fluoride, but fluoride itself doubles cancer risk.
[00:33:05.612 --> 00:33:07.214]  And he kind of called up and apologized.
[00:33:07.234 --> 00:33:09.676]  He said, OK, you know, no, I'm shocked by this.
[00:33:10.296 --> 00:33:11.317]  I'm shocked by this.
[00:33:13.039 --> 00:33:16.001]  And then later I did research on him and found out his wife, you know, works there.
[00:33:16.302 --> 00:33:17.883]  So that's probably why he's shocked by it.
[00:33:17.903 --> 00:33:25.550]  Because I bet she doesn't even know, even though she has a degree in wastewater management from the same prestigious university he went to.
[00:33:27.813 --> 00:33:28.513]  I forget the name of it.
[00:33:28.553 --> 00:33:31.074]  What's the one up north of, uh, Round Rock?
[00:33:31.315 --> 00:33:32.235]  What's that big university?
[00:33:33.055 --> 00:33:35.777]  It's not big, but it's southwestern, you know.
[00:33:35.817 --> 00:33:45.161]  But the issue was, is that he's got a southwestern degree, his wife does, she's in wastewater management, works in the city of Austin, and he doesn't even know this.
[00:33:45.621 --> 00:33:52.624]  So he was kind of shocked the next time we met, and he pulled that out of the story, you know, that I'm this gook who thinks, look, it eats your frickin' bones!
[00:33:52.804 --> 00:33:54.965]  It attacks your damn br- I'm sorry, I apologize.
[00:33:55.245 --> 00:33:57.227]  I just can't do this show anymore, okay?
[00:33:57.467 --> 00:33:58.608]  I can't do it anymore.
[00:33:58.828 --> 00:34:00.970]  They know the fluoride's killing us, alright?
[00:34:01.691 --> 00:34:08.336]  And I gotta watch shows on CBS News, on television, where we're terrorists because we're warning people.
[00:34:09.877 --> 00:34:11.739]  People are giving it to their kids, people.
[00:34:12.299 --> 00:34:14.521]  They're giving it to the children.
[00:34:15.302 --> 00:34:23.269]  You go to a Baby's or Us or H-E-B food store, and they've got big aisles of fluoridated water for babies at five parts per million.
[00:34:24.714 --> 00:34:28.476]  One part per million causes a 20-point IQ reduction on average.
[00:34:28.716 --> 00:34:29.497]  Major studies.
[00:34:29.997 --> 00:34:31.718]  Massively increases cancer.
[00:34:32.038 --> 00:34:33.078]  Attacks every organ!
[00:34:33.098 --> 00:34:33.919]  And I'm the kook!
[00:34:33.959 --> 00:34:35.099]  Because I'm not supposed to get upset.
[00:34:35.119 --> 00:34:36.520]  See, they've trained everybody to be real calm in that NPR voice.
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:37.741]  Like the Rumpelstiltskin character in the new Shrek.
[00:34:37.761 --> 00:34:49.667]  Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
[00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:51.651]  I'm your friend.
[00:34:51.731 --> 00:34:53.172]  Oh, the fluoride's good.
[00:34:53.532 --> 00:34:55.413]  Terrorists don't want you to drink it.
[00:34:55.793 --> 00:35:01.937]  How does the public watch a show where the terrorists don't want you to drink fluoride?
[00:35:03.318 --> 00:35:05.199]  I mean, guys, are you getting why I'm freaking out on this?
[00:35:05.259 --> 00:35:06.460]  How obvious it is.
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:07.740]  How ridiculous.
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:17.126]  I mean, if I was writing a fictional satire book about an off-the-charts, bonkers tyranny, this would be it.
[00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:25.534]  I took my kids to see Rumpelstiltskin Saturday.
[00:35:29.199 --> 00:35:30.120]  The new Shrek movie.
[00:35:30.661 --> 00:35:36.529]  And it was upsetting actually when I was watching Rumpelstiltskin because that's exactly how these bureaucrats talk.
[00:35:36.789 --> 00:35:39.072]  They're trained to have that cadence with their voice.
[00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:43.932]  They're trained to be soothing and nice, whereas I'm a regular person.
[00:35:44.252 --> 00:35:45.433]  I'm like a cornered dog.
[00:35:45.713 --> 00:35:49.316]  I mean, I'm growling and snapping and freaked out, you know, trying to reach out to people.
[00:35:49.356 --> 00:35:58.021]  This is a normal response to turning television on, and terrorists are people that don't want to drink their fluoride.
[00:35:59.702 --> 00:36:02.644]  When on record, it savages your body.
[00:36:04.338 --> 00:36:05.659]  Oh, and you're not going to get away easily.
[00:36:06.059 --> 00:36:08.141]  They now, what was it, four years ago?
[00:36:08.161 --> 00:36:08.942]  In fact, people won't believe it.
[00:36:08.982 --> 00:36:10.123]  Google it.
[00:36:10.363 --> 00:36:13.706]  Fluoride approved as pesticide on crops.
[00:36:13.826 --> 00:36:17.008]  And it goes through the membrane of the plants and precipitates.
[00:36:17.108 --> 00:36:18.730]  Nothing precipitates like fluoride.
[00:36:19.758 --> 00:36:20.619]  Especially sodium.
[00:36:20.999 --> 00:36:26.805]  See, almost all of it, I've seen the studies, 99% stays in your body.
[00:36:26.946 --> 00:36:28.287]  It doesn't go anywhere, folks.
[00:36:28.928 --> 00:36:31.530]  You ever seen the bottom of a glass of water, all that sediment down there?
[00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:32.792]  That's chemicals and poisons.
[00:36:33.112 --> 00:36:38.257]  Hundreds of them they're authorized to put in, and that's sodium fluoride, and it's all staying in your body.
[00:36:38.518 --> 00:36:40.960]  The arthritis, the pain, all of it.
[00:36:41.761 --> 00:36:42.221]  All of it!
[00:36:42.802 --> 00:36:49.145]  The cancer, the brain damage, just so these control freak elitists, they just enjoy hurting you.
[00:36:49.325 --> 00:36:51.566]  They enjoy the power they've got over you.
[00:36:51.826 --> 00:36:53.667]  They just love brain damaging children.
[00:36:53.707 --> 00:36:54.428]  They love hurting.
[00:36:54.568 --> 00:36:55.928]  They love the bone cancer.
[00:36:56.168 --> 00:37:03.952]  They love it like a psychopath loves grabbing a woman off the street who's hitchhiking and torturing her for three weeks before they finally use her up and kill her.
[00:37:04.292 --> 00:37:09.135]  They're using us up, every one of you cops, FBI agents, all of you that serve the system.
[00:37:09.795 --> 00:37:11.476]  You're not real psychopaths, are you?
[00:37:11.536 --> 00:37:13.158]  You don't know about this information.
[00:37:13.618 --> 00:37:14.919]  You've been taught I'm a crazy.
[00:37:15.159 --> 00:37:37.177]  When you're in that relaxed, unquestioning brainwash mode, eating your dinner every night, every form of that TV dinner designed to sterilize you, the plastic container with the estrogen mimickers, the MSG, the other chemicals that are added, you're sitting there eating that meal, every level designed to chemically attack you, you're there drinking your beer,
[00:37:38.146 --> 00:37:39.387]  Watching the television.
[00:37:40.348 --> 00:37:41.929]  Come on, wake up from the trance.
[00:37:42.809 --> 00:37:45.751]  The bad guy doesn't like fluoride in your water.
[00:37:45.791 --> 00:37:57.059]  The government is paying, that's admitted, that's bad enough, for messages in shows where people that talk about chemtrails and sodium fluoride are terrorists.
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.182]  The terrorists are the people that made that show.
[00:38:02.683 --> 00:38:02.983]  Come on.
[00:38:03.943 --> 00:38:04.544]  Come on, wake up.
[00:38:05.851 --> 00:38:06.552]  Wake up out there.
[00:38:06.592 --> 00:38:06.832]  Come on.
[00:38:07.312 --> 00:38:07.612]  Wake up.
[00:38:07.653 --> 00:38:08.733]  This isn't hard, folks.
[00:38:09.174 --> 00:38:09.894]  This isn't hard.
[00:38:09.954 --> 00:38:10.275]  Come on.
[00:38:10.835 --> 00:38:12.717]  Go check the EPA scientists for yourself.
[00:38:13.577 --> 00:38:15.059]  Thousands of them signed petitions.
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:20.863]  And I've had a bunch of them on, including the leader of the union.
[00:38:22.594 --> 00:38:24.476]  He talked about how it was like a spell.
[00:38:25.096 --> 00:38:32.022]  He goes, yeah, all these years I hadn't looked at what sodium fluoride does and how deadly it is and how it precipitates out and is cumulative poison.
[00:38:32.482 --> 00:38:36.786]  And I didn't know that under the name sodium fluoride, it can be up to 350 chemicals they put in.
[00:38:37.546 --> 00:38:38.727]  The average water system is around 150.
[00:38:41.857 --> 00:38:43.258]  And he said, I just can't believe it.
[00:38:44.679 --> 00:38:46.180]  It's like the head dentist in Canada.
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:47.500]  We had him on years ago.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.762]  He's the guy that got the water fluoridated 20-something years ago.
[00:38:51.122 --> 00:38:58.847]  And then people sent him the research that it was hundreds of chemicals under the name, and that it wasn't calcium fluoride, which is good in small amounts, that it was deadly poison.
[00:38:59.207 --> 00:39:00.608]  And he flipped out and warned people.
[00:39:01.108 --> 00:39:02.169]  But it doesn't matter, doctor.
[00:39:02.209 --> 00:39:10.234]  It doesn't matter how many doctors, how many chemists, how many toxicologists, how many epidemiologists, how many brain surgeons go public.
[00:39:11.054 --> 00:39:14.419]  They're gonna make CBS movie shows where you're a terrorist.
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:15.701]  Let's go ahead and play the clip now.
[00:39:15.721 --> 00:39:16.522]  Let's go ahead and go to it.
[00:39:16.542 --> 00:39:16.923]  Here it is.
[00:39:17.904 --> 00:39:18.285]  Peyton!
[00:39:20.108 --> 00:39:20.568]  Hi, Steph.
[00:39:20.628 --> 00:39:21.770]  What are you two doing here?
[00:39:22.932 --> 00:39:23.252]  Hey.
[00:39:24.113 --> 00:39:26.837]  I think I may know a little something about your poison victim.
[00:39:28.171 --> 00:39:30.614]  And I'm here to prove a man innocent.
[00:39:31.514 --> 00:39:33.236]  I got a little intel on Professor Scarves.
[00:39:33.897 --> 00:39:36.720]  He has a history of espousing various conspiracy theories.
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.483]  Sharing them with his students scarred him into a little trouble.
[00:39:39.823 --> 00:39:43.106]  Every university has at least one unconventional professor.
[00:39:43.126 --> 00:39:44.348]  Oh, come on, Peyton.
[00:39:44.488 --> 00:39:45.829]  This guy's IB is here.
[00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:47.870]  Totally anti-American.
[00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:48.251]  Look at this.
[00:39:48.711 --> 00:39:52.052]  Water fluoridations, tsunami bombs, chemtrails.
[00:39:52.112 --> 00:39:52.952]  What are chemtrails?
[00:39:53.332 --> 00:39:59.915]  Some people believe that vapor exhaust from aircraft are actually dangerous biochemicals dispersed into the air.
[00:39:59.975 --> 00:40:01.895]  Which only proves that Kevin's a little odd.
[00:40:02.296 --> 00:40:10.879]  Prints from the tape lift show that both Kevin Scott and or John Doe touched the case and analysis of the paper on the bottom of the birdcage does not confirm evidence of poison.
[00:40:11.239 --> 00:40:11.679]  Thank you!
[00:40:12.697 --> 00:40:14.519]  Many poisons are highly volatile.
[00:40:14.539 --> 00:40:16.081]  They can evaporate within minutes.
[00:40:16.141 --> 00:40:18.643]  Just because it wasn't detected doesn't mean it wasn't there.
[00:40:18.664 --> 00:40:25.010]  Scott's background says he was recently forced into retirement by the university.
[00:40:26.652 --> 00:40:27.233]  Eight months ago.
[00:40:27.253 --> 00:40:29.035]  He stopped teaching.
[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:30.781]  I never mentioned it.
[00:40:30.881 --> 00:40:33.683]  There were also two recent arrests for public disturbance.
[00:40:34.163 --> 00:40:36.885]  None of what you're saying sounds like the man that I know.
[00:40:37.206 --> 00:40:42.370]  Well, we don't have anything that connects Kevin Scott to the poison, or to our John Doe's death.
[00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.690]  Okay.
[00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:43.991]  Sid's autopsy report.
[00:40:44.091 --> 00:40:45.112]  And it goes on and on.
[00:40:45.512 --> 00:40:49.455]  So he's a guy who taught the kids that chemtrails are real.
[00:40:49.735 --> 00:40:55.360]  No, we're not saying all jet trails, ice crystals, are chemtrail spray.
[00:40:56.877 --> 00:41:05.202]  We said in 95, all over the western world, some planes began spraying, even at low level, condensation trails that do not dissipate.
[00:41:05.923 --> 00:41:14.688]  Then, meteorologists and others who we've interviewed at major TV stations got samples, found it was barium salts aluminum dioxide.
[00:41:16.329 --> 00:41:19.711]  Then, in the last two years, so about 13-14 years later,
[00:41:22.864 --> 00:41:32.447]  The government comes out and says we've had a huge secret weather modification program going on that we're now going full-scale with.
[00:41:33.027 --> 00:41:36.829]  I mean, if the previous stuff was just a test, I'd hate to see full-scale.
[00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:41.850]  And it's barium salts and aluminum dioxide to repair the ozone holes.
[00:41:43.171 --> 00:41:46.612]  Then if you know the ozone holes, those are only over Antarctica.
[00:41:47.785 --> 00:41:50.648]  The Arctic, in certain seasons, and New Zealand.
[00:41:51.488 --> 00:41:54.011]  And, by the way, you don't hear about it anymore because it got smaller.
[00:41:54.291 --> 00:41:54.831]  It's natural.
[00:41:55.011 --> 00:41:56.413]  It's part of the electromagnetic field.
[00:41:56.933 --> 00:42:00.917]  The point is, that they don't even deny this.
[00:42:00.957 --> 00:42:08.764]  But see, they know the average person isn't... Just Google John P. Holdren, White House science czar,
[00:42:13.726 --> 00:42:14.727]  Geoengineering!
[00:42:15.507 --> 00:42:19.070]  And he'll admit, and they've got all these government sites, how they're chemtrailing us.
[00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:35.863]  But see, they know the jellyfish, braindead, Prozac head, watching CSI, sitting there, sucking down fluoride water, isn't going to read a book, isn't going to go to YouTube and watch the head of the White House science program admit they're spraying us.
[00:42:37.024 --> 00:42:37.984]  They're not going to do any of it.
[00:42:38.024 --> 00:42:41.247]  By the way, the weather modification is only a small part of the program.
[00:42:43.302 --> 00:42:46.185]  And then there's the whole fluoride thing, and of course it turns out he's a terrorist.
[00:42:46.706 --> 00:42:47.587]  He's a terrorist!
[00:42:47.627 --> 00:42:48.668]  He doesn't like chemtrails.
[00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:55.896]  So the message is, you talk about chemtrails, you talk about poison in the water, you are a terrorist.
[00:42:56.017 --> 00:42:56.357]  Okay?
[00:42:56.717 --> 00:42:59.541]  So drink your water, breathe your chemtrails, and shut up.
[00:43:00.041 --> 00:43:00.782]  Nine years.
[00:43:00.942 --> 00:43:02.503]  Thousands of clients worldwide.
[00:43:02.663 --> 00:43:03.584]  Amazing results.
[00:43:03.744 --> 00:43:09.367]  And here's more proof of the effectiveness of how Heart and Body Extract supports good circulation and healthy arterial flow.
[00:43:09.548 --> 00:43:10.508]  My name is Crystal.
[00:43:10.888 --> 00:43:13.470]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:17.433]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[00:43:17.773 --> 00:43:21.796]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[00:43:21.916 --> 00:43:22.736]  What did Crystal do?
[00:43:22.756 --> 00:43:25.178]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[00:43:26.699 --> 00:43:33.006]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[00:43:33.107 --> 00:43:36.731]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.

[00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:01.131]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:44:01.171 --> 00:44:06.535]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:44:06.755 --> 00:44:11.378]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:44:11.779 --> 00:44:12.179]  It's true.
[00:44:12.259 --> 00:44:16.862]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:44:17.363 --> 00:44:22.066]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:44:22.587 --> 00:44:24.448]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:44:24.881 --> 00:44:29.483]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:44:29.683 --> 00:44:30.583]  And here's the best part.
[00:44:30.803 --> 00:44:33.564]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:44:33.864 --> 00:44:37.186]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:44:37.486 --> 00:44:40.327]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:44:40.687 --> 00:44:42.568]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:44:42.888 --> 00:44:43.828]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:44:43.848 --> 00:44:44.228]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:44:44.248 --> 00:44:45.149]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[00:44:53.976 --> 00:44:56.217]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:44:56.537 --> 00:44:58.977]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:44:59.977 --> 00:45:00.517]  You worry.
[00:45:00.898 --> 00:45:02.638]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:45:02.938 --> 00:45:05.158]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:45:05.479 --> 00:45:07.299]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:45:07.559 --> 00:45:08.759]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:45:09.159 --> 00:45:12.360]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:17.621]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:45:18.001 --> 00:45:21.302]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:45:21.806 --> 00:45:23.127]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:45:23.487 --> 00:45:26.089]  Wild food grows everywhere, and you will see it everywhere.
[00:45:26.349 --> 00:45:29.310]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:45:29.651 --> 00:45:37.815]  Well-respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[00:45:38.096 --> 00:45:42.498]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[00:46:02.617 --> 00:46:15.301]  In Steve Watson's article, he links all the mainstream news reports where they say, oh it's wonderful, the government's funding most TV now, with messages.
[00:46:17.002 --> 00:46:22.784]  Messages for global government, messages for carbon tax, anti-Second Amendment messages.
[00:46:26.065 --> 00:46:27.965]  Totally illegal, totally creepy.
[00:46:29.226 --> 00:46:30.186]  Courts ruled Bush
[00:46:32.403 --> 00:46:35.505]  Wasn't allowed to spend billions of dollars a year on fake news packages.
[00:46:35.785 --> 00:46:36.725]  This is all criminal.
[00:46:36.745 --> 00:46:37.766]  This is un-American.
[00:46:39.047 --> 00:46:41.048]  But what is the message the government wants?
[00:46:42.388 --> 00:46:43.509]  CSI detective.
[00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:46.811]  I have a little intel on Professor Scott.
[00:46:47.251 --> 00:46:49.712]  He has a history of espousing various conspiracy theories.
[00:46:50.273 --> 00:46:52.334]  Sharing them with his students got him in a little trouble.
[00:46:53.769 --> 00:46:57.092]  So, see, one cop walks up to the CSI investigators.
[00:46:57.152 --> 00:46:59.734]  Hey, he got in a little trouble for his conspiracy theories.
[00:47:00.074 --> 00:47:04.037]  The message is, you lose your job, because next they talk about he lost his job.
[00:47:04.558 --> 00:47:05.118]  Well, good.
[00:47:06.179 --> 00:47:06.919]  That's what you do.
[00:47:06.979 --> 00:47:08.641]  You question things in America?
[00:47:10.422 --> 00:47:11.923]  You read government documents?
[00:47:12.904 --> 00:47:14.485]  This is so un-American.
[00:47:15.826 --> 00:47:18.849]  Oh, I mean, this guy's almost as bad as George Washington.
[00:47:19.946 --> 00:47:20.887]  Professor's friends.
[00:47:21.487 --> 00:47:24.349]  Every university has at least one unconventional professor.
[00:47:24.669 --> 00:47:26.150]  So she's defending it.
[00:47:28.572 --> 00:47:29.733]  Of course, she's proven wrong.
[00:47:30.293 --> 00:47:31.674]  Second CSI detective.
[00:47:32.194 --> 00:47:33.195]  Oh, come on, Peyton.
[00:47:33.695 --> 00:47:36.477]  This guy's ideas are totally anti-American.
[00:47:38.318 --> 00:47:40.460]  His ideas are anti-American.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:41.901]  See, ideas are bad.
[00:47:43.666 --> 00:47:48.407]  Meanwhile, the globalists are destroying America, robbing our treasury, destroying our name.
[00:47:49.067 --> 00:47:50.768]  Oh, but they're the good globalists.
[00:47:51.588 --> 00:47:52.548]  They're the good guys.
[00:47:55.609 --> 00:47:56.409]  Oh, come on, Peyton.
[00:47:56.429 --> 00:47:59.190]  This guy's ideas are totally anti-American.
[00:47:59.250 --> 00:47:59.970]  Look at this!
[00:48:01.951 --> 00:48:03.131]  Water fluoridation.
[00:48:04.632 --> 00:48:05.892]  Tsunami bombs.
[00:48:06.652 --> 00:48:07.452]  Chemtrails.
[00:48:09.493 --> 00:48:11.233]  Well, I remember the Age newspaper.
[00:48:11.434 --> 00:48:11.914]  I remember AP.
[00:48:15.618 --> 00:48:16.499]  A decade ago.
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:23.523]  We never said the tsunami was a tsunami bomb, but it was declassified in the 50s.
[00:48:24.343 --> 00:48:28.726]  The US, the Australians, and the British looked at nuclear weapons to cause tsunamis.
[00:48:30.373 --> 00:48:37.059]  So, if anybody ever talked about a tsunami bomb and read it out of the newspaper, the message is, look, you don't read stuff out of the newspaper.
[00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:47.009]  The message is, if you know anything about chemtrails, anything about water fluoridation, anything about tsunami bombs, notice they use three real things there.
[00:48:48.203 --> 00:48:57.095]  They didn't say you're a terrorist who deserves to be fired from your job, and he is later found to be a terrorist, of course he's guilty, if you believe in little green men.
[00:48:57.255 --> 00:48:58.197]  Oh no, they promote that.
[00:48:58.217 --> 00:49:00.039]  They want you talking about that all day on the news.
[00:49:01.101 --> 00:49:01.842]  Larry King live.
[00:49:03.584 --> 00:49:07.947]  Or if you're talking about abominable snowmen, or Bigfoot, or any of that, that's fine.
[00:49:08.368 --> 00:49:13.532]  They don't want you talking about chemtrails, and they don't want you talking about water fluoridation.
[00:49:13.892 --> 00:49:14.713]  Uh-uh-uh!
[00:49:15.653 --> 00:49:18.496]  And they don't want you talking about man-made global warming not being real.
[00:49:19.036 --> 00:49:23.680]  White House regulations czar says, you need to be arrested!
[00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:28.163]  And I've got a headline.
[00:49:30.336 --> 00:49:33.238]  I've got a headline right here in my stack from yesterday.
[00:49:33.258 --> 00:49:35.960]  FCC says it's taking over the Internet.
[00:49:39.783 --> 00:49:41.044]  This is all happening right now.
[00:49:41.064 --> 00:49:49.910]  You know, I've done two hours of radio before I come back with our guest.
[00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:56.671]  Andrew Wakefield, Dr. Wakefield, I'm just briefly going to tell you this.
[00:49:56.831 --> 00:50:09.176]  If you believe in what we're doing here and you want to see us continue what we're doing and be able to expand and make even more films and a weekly television program and everything that needs to be done, I need your financial support.
[00:50:09.656 --> 00:50:13.277]  And you do that by buying the books and videos and materials at InfoWars.com.
[00:50:13.297 --> 00:50:16.038]  And then, of course, they're very useful tools in waking people up.
[00:50:16.358 --> 00:50:17.079]  Don't tread on me.
[00:50:17.859 --> 00:50:18.880]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:20.381]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:49.525 --> 00:50:51.847]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:50:51.907 --> 00:50:54.109]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:50:54.129 --> 00:50:57.412]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:50:57.452 --> 00:51:02.196]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:51:02.556 --> 00:51:06.760]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:09.381]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:51:09.401 --> 00:51:11.922]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:51:12.282 --> 00:51:14.863]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:51:15.204 --> 00:51:22.807]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:51:23.143 --> 00:51:28.405]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:51:28.525 --> 00:51:31.306]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:51:31.366 --> 00:51:34.807]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:51:35.067 --> 00:51:35.988]  And I got news for you.
[00:51:36.128 --> 00:51:37.428]  You're everyone else.
[00:51:37.468 --> 00:51:38.529]  Invisible Empire.

[00:51:52.603 --> 00:51:54.525]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:55.005 --> 00:51:57.888]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:04.273 --> 00:52:04.933]  Big Brother.
[00:52:05.594 --> 00:52:06.635]  Mainstream media.
[00:52:07.356 --> 00:52:08.517]  Government cover-ups.
[00:52:09.117 --> 00:52:09.938]  You want answers?
[00:52:10.698 --> 00:52:12.600]  Well, so does he.
[00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:15.903]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:16.443 --> 00:52:20.507]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:52:25.015 --> 00:52:28.956]  Alright, we've separately confirmed the intel that Steve Quayle gave us.
[00:52:33.478 --> 00:52:45.621]  Dealing with detention centers inside, for during civil unrest or financial collapse, inside of the post offices.
[00:52:45.641 --> 00:52:46.982]  So that's coming up in the next hour.
[00:52:47.952 --> 00:52:58.374]  And I did dig up some news articles from 2002 under the Model State Health Emergency Powers Act dealing with forced inoculations for smallpox to be carried out at the post offices.
[00:52:58.414 --> 00:52:59.675]  So that's coming up next hour.
[00:53:02.915 --> 00:53:13.258]  We have had, it's got to be more than a hundred medical doctors and scientists and epidemiologists and virologists on over the years covering all the different studies about mercury in children's brains.
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:16.701]  Brain surgeons, neurologists, you name it.
[00:53:17.681 --> 00:53:21.362]  And we know that autism's gone from, what, 1 in 25,000 two decades ago to 1 in 68.
[00:53:23.302 --> 00:53:25.703]  Some numbers are 1 in 55, and that's now admitted.
[00:53:25.723 --> 00:53:26.923]  The government doesn't deny that.
[00:53:27.843 --> 00:53:32.724]  And they've linked Crohn's disease to the antibodies for the measles shot in the intestines.
[00:53:33.064 --> 00:53:34.325]  We know that's way off the charts.
[00:53:35.145 --> 00:53:40.646]  But the doctor who was chosen to be demonized as part of a media hoax is Dr. Andrew Wakefield.
[00:53:42.367 --> 00:53:43.567]  And it's just like Rand Paul.
[00:53:44.554 --> 00:53:46.575]  He never said get rid of the Civil Rights Act.
[00:53:47.076 --> 00:53:50.518]  He said that private clubs should be able to have who they want.
[00:53:50.958 --> 00:53:55.240]  In the case of Bohemian Grove wants to be all men, there's all women clubs.
[00:53:55.641 --> 00:53:57.362]  Sonia Sotomayor is part of one.
[00:53:58.122 --> 00:53:58.802]  That's their issue.
[00:53:59.263 --> 00:54:03.745]  But the media ran the national hoax that he is a racist with no evidence.
[00:54:04.546 --> 00:54:06.907]  And it's the same thing with Dr. Andrew J. Wakefield.
[00:54:07.388 --> 00:54:12.891]  You've got the government and the media caught putting out thousands of fake reports, fake studies,
[00:54:14.727 --> 00:54:23.673]  By the big pharma companies, lying and saying there were no ill effects of the H1N1, putting out fake data sheets at hospitals and clinics.
[00:54:24.293 --> 00:54:32.818]  Meanwhile, the actual insert with the H1N1 said, can cause Guillain-Barré, can cause infertility, can be linked to cancer, can kill you.
[00:54:32.838 --> 00:54:34.159]  You know, that was on the insert.
[00:54:34.459 --> 00:54:37.021]  But the hoax was, no, none of this is true.
[00:54:38.342 --> 00:54:49.630]  So we're going to go to break, come back here in one minute, and go straight to Dr. Andrew J. Wakefield and his new book, Callous Disregard, Autism Vaccines, the Truth Behind a Tragedy.
[00:54:50.190 --> 00:55:02.019]  And because he's one of the most prominent and well-spoken doctors, and works with Jenny McCarthy and others, and she wrote the foreword to his book, they have chosen him as kind of a general to try to assassinate politically.
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:07.803]  And they run this hoax, knowing the public doesn't know how research is done.
[00:55:12.144 --> 00:55:15.948]  He paid people to let him do research on them.
[00:55:15.968 --> 00:55:17.529]  Well, that's how almost all studies are done.
[00:55:18.991 --> 00:55:21.012]  And so they claim that that's unethical.
[00:55:21.052 --> 00:55:29.300]  And it's just all this made-up baloney dealing with callous disregard.
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:35.846]  And so now they've got the headline, UK bans doctor who linked autism to vaccine.
[00:55:37.463 --> 00:56:03.068]  And they just imply that he's a big liar, and now vaccines are good, and it isn't six vaccines we want you to take by 18 months, it's 50 plus, and we want to give you a cancer vaccine, an HIV vaccine, an HPV vaccine that they admit has killed a bunch of people, and doesn't even protect you, and basically we're going to set the precedent to forcibly inoculate you, because it's all lies, Wakefield's a liar, with no evidence.
[00:56:03.088 --> 00:56:04.749]  So you'll hear directly from the man,
[00:56:05.689 --> 00:56:11.576]  On the other side of this break, we're honored to have him here on the broadcast with us.
[00:56:11.616 --> 00:56:16.803]  But, you know, who can deny, ladies and gentlemen, I mean, I saw four or five articles.
[00:56:16.843 --> 00:56:18.184]  In fact, print them again from this week.
[00:56:20.247 --> 00:56:22.550]  Flu vaccine contaminated with live pig virus.
[00:56:25.677 --> 00:56:33.834]  Food and Drug Administration says it's okay, and in the article it admits, well, it is linked to giving humans these diseases, but so what?
[00:56:33.854 --> 00:56:33.954]  Or... SV40!
[00:56:39.142 --> 00:56:41.685]  Live cancer virus in the polio vaccine.
[00:56:42.585 --> 00:56:45.268]  Now they admit it gave tens of millions of people cancer in the U.S.
[00:56:45.328 --> 00:56:45.648]  alone.
[00:56:46.749 --> 00:56:48.491]  But they're counting on you being ignorant.
[00:56:49.051 --> 00:56:57.840]  You know, they say, case closed, with no evidence, Wakefield is the devil, roll up your sleeves, hundreds of shots, take them, take them, take them, we'll be back.
[00:56:59.633 --> 00:57:01.235]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:57:01.275 --> 00:57:04.078]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[00:57:23.599 --> 00:57:29.804]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[00:57:51.666 --> 00:57:52.186]  Thank you!
[00:57:59.315 --> 00:58:04.179]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:58:04.279 --> 00:58:05.059]  What have we got?
[00:58:05.279 --> 00:58:07.401]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:58:07.721 --> 00:58:08.462]  A republic.
[00:58:08.742 --> 00:58:11.304]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:58:11.384 --> 00:58:13.305]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:58:13.646 --> 00:58:15.547]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:58:15.667 --> 00:58:16.948]  So they think they own our land?
[00:58:17.348 --> 00:58:18.469]  They think they own our water?
[00:58:18.669 --> 00:58:19.070]  Children?
[00:58:19.290 --> 00:58:20.070]  Our education?
[00:58:20.391 --> 00:58:21.011]  Our money?
[00:58:21.231 --> 00:58:24.874]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:58:25.234 --> 00:58:28.879]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:58:30.221 --> 00:58:31.042]  We have the facts.
[00:58:31.242 --> 00:58:32.344]  We have the Constitution.
[00:58:32.404 --> 00:58:33.285]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:58:33.305 --> 00:58:34.146]  We have common law.
[00:58:34.206 --> 00:58:36.449]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:40.495]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:58:40.595 --> 00:58:45.378]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:58:45.559 --> 00:58:46.919]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:47.880]  Don't tread on me.

[00:58:59.195 --> 00:59:00.455]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:59:00.495 --> 00:59:05.837]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:59:06.077 --> 00:59:10.699]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:59:11.099 --> 00:59:11.499]  It's true.
[00:59:11.579 --> 00:59:16.141]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:59:16.681 --> 00:59:21.364]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:59:21.905 --> 00:59:23.826]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:59:24.206 --> 00:59:28.809]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:59:29.009 --> 00:59:29.910]  And here's the best part.
[00:59:30.130 --> 00:59:32.892]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:59:33.212 --> 00:59:36.494]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:59:36.815 --> 00:59:39.656]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:59:40.017 --> 00:59:41.898]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:59:42.238 --> 00:59:43.159]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:59:48.162 --> 00:59:50.483]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:59:51.024 --> 00:59:55.526]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:59:55.846 --> 00:59:58.308]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:00:00.829 --> 01:00:06.492]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:06.552 --> 01:00:13.216]  All right, I want to be clear here.
[01:00:16.465 --> 01:00:21.869]  Without even looking, every day, I see headlines like this one.
[01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:25.072]  Mutant polio virus spreads in Nigeria.
[01:00:26.073 --> 01:00:30.737]  And I see it happen in Latin America, in the Middle East, always the same UN program.
[01:00:32.298 --> 01:00:38.443]  Polio, the dreaded paralyzing disease stamped out industrialized world, is spreading in Nigeria, as health officials say.
[01:00:38.763 --> 01:00:42.046]  In some cases, it's caused by the vaccine used to fight it.
[01:00:42.066 --> 01:00:44.028]  That's CBS News.
[01:00:45.666 --> 01:00:46.166]  Weaponize.
[01:00:46.186 --> 01:00:46.606]  Here's another one.
[01:00:47.066 --> 01:00:47.586]  FDA.
[01:00:47.927 --> 01:00:52.488]  Glax... Merck vaccines okay despite pig virus.
[01:00:52.628 --> 01:00:53.028]  Reuters.
[01:00:54.228 --> 01:01:01.010]  And it says the viruses made by GlaxoSmithKline and Merck are safe to use despite being contaminated with pig virus.
[01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:01.730]  U.S.
[01:01:01.770 --> 01:01:03.230]  health regulators said Friday.
[01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:08.131]  And then it goes on to admit that it can actually be linked to cancer and other health problems.
[01:01:08.572 --> 01:01:10.172]  Folks, this is every day.
[01:01:12.588 --> 01:01:19.170]  We read about, I mean I had Wolfgang Wudrag on a few months ago, the head of the EU Commission, a medical doctor.
[01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:33.795]  They got all the documents, how the big five drug companies paid off the US, British and EU government heads, their doctors, to come out and say, you're all dead, it's the most deadly thing in history, hundreds of millions are going to die, take the H1N1 shot.
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.823]  And then his commission found it is a dangerous shot.
[01:01:38.344 --> 01:01:40.748]  So what's happening is they're getting decimated.
[01:01:41.068 --> 01:01:43.151]  They're losing their propaganda war.
[01:01:43.892 --> 01:01:47.457]  And so what they'll do is they'll pick out a sacrificial goat.
[01:01:49.331 --> 01:01:56.576]  Someone to basically punish publicly, to create a hoax so that people won't look at the masses of evidence.
[01:01:56.596 --> 01:01:59.938]  And here it is, UK banned doctor who linked autism to vaccine.
[01:02:00.178 --> 01:02:11.046]  For three years they have savagely lied about him, misrepresented what he's done, and now they've taken his medical license in England.
[01:02:11.826 --> 01:02:13.949]  He's a British surgeon who lives in Austin, by the way.
[01:02:14.310 --> 01:02:21.140]  Researcher best known for his work regarding MMR vaccine and its connection with autism and inflammatory bowel disease.
[01:02:23.138 --> 01:02:27.681]  And just a few days ago, he lost his medical license in the UK, but he's already moved here.
[01:02:28.061 --> 01:02:32.624]  His new book is Callous Disregard, Autism and Vaccines, The Truth Behind the Tragedy.
[01:02:33.225 --> 01:02:34.826]  And you can get the book in bookstores everywhere.
[01:02:35.046 --> 01:02:36.547]  It's forwarded by Jenny McCarthy.
[01:02:37.347 --> 01:02:42.651]  So we go to Dr. Andrew Wakefield now to get the truth from him.
[01:02:42.971 --> 01:02:44.192]  Sir, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:02:44.832 --> 01:02:45.713]  Alex, thank you very much.
[01:02:45.813 --> 01:02:46.494]  Great pleasure.
[01:02:46.654 --> 01:02:48.535]  And thank you very much for your supportive words.
[01:02:49.252 --> 01:02:49.552]  You bet.
[01:02:49.572 --> 01:03:01.598]  Now, just give us the back story, your awakening, the studies you did, which are backed up by a bunch of other studies I would add now, and then how they've tried to crucify you as a case point example.
[01:03:02.659 --> 01:03:04.159]  I will, and I'll try and be brief, Alex.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.042]  I am a mainstream academic gastroenterologist working in London.
[01:03:09.662 --> 01:03:15.725]  May 1996, parents, sorry, 1995, parents started calling me and saying my kid was normal.
[01:03:16.533 --> 01:03:24.416]  They had this vaccine, MMR, and they lost their skills, they lost eye contact, they didn't want to play, they couldn't speak anymore, and they became autistic.
[01:03:24.456 --> 01:03:27.518]  And I said, I'm sorry, you must have got the wrong number, because I'm a gastroenterologist.
[01:03:27.538 --> 01:03:36.241]  They said, my kid has got terrible bowel problems, diarrhea 12 times a day, they're in terrible pain, they're banging their head against the wall, I know they're in pain, they're bloated.
[01:03:36.922 --> 01:03:39.863]  And the doctor says, your kid's autistic, they're bound to have these problems.
[01:03:39.883 --> 01:03:41.544]  That doesn't make any sense at all.
[01:03:41.944 --> 01:03:44.465]  So we investigated these children, and they had a bowel disease.
[01:03:45.345 --> 01:03:56.069]  So we did our duty, our clinical duty, to put the children before anything else and investigate them and we found they had a treatable bowel disease which the medical profession had ignored previously.
[01:03:56.669 --> 01:04:01.671]  Now the problem came when the parents said that my child regressed after a vaccine.
[01:04:02.431 --> 01:04:11.174]  If the child had regressed after natural chicken pox, people would have found that fascinating and you and I wouldn't be having this conversation now, but because it was a vaccine it could not happen.
[01:04:12.026 --> 01:04:14.288]  The parents were right about the bowel problem in their kids.
[01:04:14.328 --> 01:04:21.434]  The doctors were wrong and therefore we had a moral and professional obligation to look at whether the vaccine was causing the problem.
[01:04:21.734 --> 01:04:24.096]  That's when the trouble started.
[01:04:25.217 --> 01:04:32.504]  So I said, right, I'm going to go back and I'm going to read every safety study that's ever been done on measles vaccines, MMR vaccines.
[01:04:33.184 --> 01:04:35.146]  I wrote a 250 page report.
[01:04:35.166 --> 01:04:36.407]  I offered it to my colleagues.
[01:04:36.507 --> 01:04:38.669]  I said, I can no longer support the use
[01:04:39.255 --> 01:04:42.137]  of this vaccine because the safety studies are not there.
[01:04:42.857 --> 01:04:44.318]  They're just not there.
[01:04:44.338 --> 01:04:45.979]  Doctor, let me stop you right now.
[01:04:46.079 --> 01:04:47.259]  I'm going to need you to start over.
[01:04:47.299 --> 01:04:50.141]  You've backed away from your phone, so we're having trouble hearing you.
[01:04:50.381 --> 01:04:51.281]  Okay.
[01:04:51.942 --> 01:04:52.902]  Yeah, get closer to your phone.
[01:04:52.922 --> 01:04:53.262]  Go ahead.
[01:04:53.823 --> 01:04:54.143]  Okay.
[01:04:55.063 --> 01:04:59.125]  So, I took the vaccine safety issue very, very seriously.
[01:04:59.145 --> 01:05:03.328]  In many ways, I wish I'd taken it more seriously before I vaccinated my own children.
[01:05:04.288 --> 01:05:05.609]  Alex, am I coming across now?
[01:05:05.729 --> 01:05:06.489]  Yes, you are, sir.
[01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:07.230]  Okay, good.
[01:05:08.570 --> 01:05:20.795]  And I made the recommendation that children should continue to be vaccinated, but might get the single vaccines, because I felt that the safety studies of the single vaccines, measles, mumps, and rubella, were better than those for MMR.
[01:05:21.976 --> 01:05:26.758]  Anyway, this caused a meltdown, because they didn't want that to happen.
[01:05:26.778 --> 01:05:28.278]  The government didn't want that to happen.
[01:05:28.979 --> 01:05:36.282]  So I made that recommendation in February of 1998, and when demand for the single vaccine was at its highest,
[01:05:37.132 --> 01:05:44.016]  Six months later, the government withdrew the license for that vaccine in the UK, and so parents could no longer get the choice.
[01:05:44.617 --> 01:05:46.058]  Now, why would you do that?
[01:05:46.338 --> 01:05:53.042]  Why would you take away a choice from parents for how they would protect their children by removing the single vaccine?
[01:05:53.242 --> 01:05:54.663]  And so measles came back.
[01:05:54.863 --> 01:05:59.966]  They blame me, and in fact, the reason it came back is because they took away the choice.
[01:06:00.486 --> 01:06:06.590]  It wasn't an anti-vaccine argument, but it was saying, give parents the choice of how they protect their children.
[01:06:06.994 --> 01:06:08.575]  The government took that choice away.
[01:06:10.916 --> 01:06:26.666]  Dr. Wakefield, going back to the beginning, I've also seen research papers separate from yours that Crohn's that didn't exist until the 50s and 60s has been linked to antibodies associated with measles vaccines and others.
[01:06:26.866 --> 01:06:34.331]  And again, I'm not a doctor, but for any layperson, if a child supposedly has a neurological disorder, why would that cause them
[01:06:35.211 --> 01:06:40.874]  To have horrible diarrhea, which anyone with an autistic child knows is associated with it.
[01:06:41.154 --> 01:06:45.196]  I mean, they know exactly what's going on here, so let's break that down.
[01:06:46.357 --> 01:06:53.861]  Well, okay, the first question is, why would there be a link between a gastrointestinal problem and a brain disorder?
[01:06:53.881 --> 01:06:58.283]  Well, this has been known for a long, long time, and we are what we eat, in effect.
[01:06:58.363 --> 01:07:00.364]  You'll know, Alex, I mean, I know, because I like beer.
[01:07:00.384 --> 01:07:03.626]  If I drink a beer, then five minutes later, I'm going to feel the effect in my brain.
[01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:16.950]  So toxins, neurotoxins from the intestine will get through and affect the brain and the drugs that we give to treat psychological and psychiatric conditions are absorbed through the intestine.
[01:07:17.751 --> 01:07:26.658]  We also know that there are diseases like liver failure where the more you become jaundiced then your brain stops to work and then you ultimately go into coma and die.
[01:07:27.518 --> 01:07:35.303]  And that is because bacterial products from the gut are getting through and injuring the brain because the damaged liver isn't filtering them out.
[01:07:35.363 --> 01:07:41.166]  So this concept that there is a link between the bowel and the brain is as old as the hill.
[01:07:42.067 --> 01:07:44.308]  Is it relevant to what's happening in children with autism?
[01:07:44.468 --> 01:07:45.008]  I think so.
[01:07:45.669 --> 01:07:51.552]  But the most important thing is it generates testable ideas, testable scientific ideas that can be looked at.
[01:07:52.112 --> 01:07:54.934]  And what we find is when we treat the children's intestines,
[01:07:55.758 --> 01:07:57.720]  In many cases, the brain improves.
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:02.563]  That's very exciting, because before this, we were dealing with a disease that is untreatable.
[01:08:03.063 --> 01:08:05.325]  The kids got autism, put them in a home, forget about them.
[01:08:05.945 --> 01:08:07.746]  Now, we can start to do something about it.
[01:08:10.148 --> 01:08:22.977]  And the system is mad because you're a prestigious doctor, you're well-spoken, your research has now been backed up by other studies, and so they have now crucified you, or they're attempting to destroy you, but I think this is going to backfire on them.
[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:32.725]  Well, you know, to be honest, it could become their worst nightmare because I have been constrained from saying anything so far because of the legal process.
[01:08:32.865 --> 01:08:34.907]  Now that's over and I can speak.
[01:08:35.007 --> 01:08:50.676]  And during the course of the hearing in the UK that you were talking about, the regulatory hearing, I obtained a lot of documents which are going to be very, very embarrassing for the government because what they exposed is why they went to these lengths to discredit me in the first place.
[01:08:51.437 --> 01:08:51.777]  And, um,
[01:08:52.543 --> 01:09:03.146]  What is interesting is that when I got involved in litigation on behalf of the children as a medical expert, I thought that we were litigating against the pharmaceutical company.
[01:09:03.166 --> 01:09:04.006]  In fact, we weren't.
[01:09:04.327 --> 01:09:07.387]  In the UK, we were litigating against the government.
[01:09:07.527 --> 01:09:07.828]  Why?
[01:09:08.548 --> 01:09:16.370]  Because when we introduced the MMR vaccine in the UK, it was a dangerous vaccine that was introduced.
[01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:19.511]  It had already been withdrawn in Canada for safety reasons.
[01:09:20.336 --> 01:09:27.338]  But it was introduced in the UK knowing that there was a problem, but because it was made by the home team.
[01:09:28.138 --> 01:09:30.059]  It was made by a UK company.
[01:09:31.199 --> 01:09:41.142]  And so they appear to have given a preferential market share to the UK company, despite the fact that they knew the vaccine had problems.
[01:09:41.862 --> 01:09:44.943]  And the UK company, reluctant to get involved in that,
[01:09:45.862 --> 01:09:51.343]  Seems to have got an indemnity from the government, so the government assumed their liability for vaccine damage.
[01:09:51.863 --> 01:09:53.404]  They didn't want that news to come out.
[01:09:56.344 --> 01:10:04.426]  Doc, we've got you for the rest of the hour, and I want to go through their disinformation, because when I watch the news they say, he paid people to be in his study!
[01:10:04.806 --> 01:10:08.127]  Oh my gosh, well every study I've ever seen, they pay people.
[01:10:08.527 --> 01:10:12.988]  And they imply you're this liar, and you've been caught in this fraud, but we know
[01:10:14.088 --> 01:10:17.349]  As vaccination has gone up, autism has gone up.
[01:10:17.670 --> 01:10:22.432]  We've seen all these other studies now connecting not just autism but Crohn's to vaccines.
[01:10:22.472 --> 01:10:23.412]  I want to discuss that.
[01:10:24.012 --> 01:10:29.895]  And from your research, your studies, what the mechanism is, what's happening to the intestines.
[01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.430]  Yeah, I think.
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:51.103]  They've got Dr. Dina Dell and others, who says, by the way, vitamins are bad for you.
[01:10:51.123 --> 01:10:52.644]  He says, I mean, it's incredible.
[01:10:53.805 --> 01:10:57.748]  Out there basically lying about you guys, building straw men.
[01:10:58.108 --> 01:10:59.249]  They are really desperate.
[01:10:59.269 --> 01:11:05.614]  But the good news is, all the studies, all the research shows, the people are really waking up to how dangerous these vaccines are.
[01:11:06.154 --> 01:11:07.215]  But the system doesn't care.
[01:11:07.255 --> 01:11:10.498]  It's like the human papillomavirus or the Gardasil.
[01:11:11.538 --> 01:11:13.499]  In their trials, it killed a bunch of people.
[01:11:13.779 --> 01:11:15.180]  It's killed a bunch of people since.
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:16.320]  But they don't care.
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.061]  They're out there saying, take it, take it, take it.
[01:11:18.381 --> 01:11:22.802]  And in the insert, it says, does it even protect you from cervical cancer?
[01:11:23.182 --> 01:11:26.764]  So we'll talk about that with Dr. Andrew Wakefield when we come back.
[01:11:27.464 --> 01:11:29.207]  Uh, from this quick break.
[01:11:29.227 --> 01:11:31.069]  Uh, on the other side.
[01:11:31.089 --> 01:11:33.292]  Uh, and we'll give you his website.
[01:11:33.332 --> 01:11:42.324]  We'll tell you more about the book, Callous Disregard, Autism Vaccines, The Truth Behind a, uh, Tragedy, forwarded by Jenny McCarthy.
[01:11:42.344 --> 01:11:44.367]  Uh, all I want to do is save children.
[01:11:45.632 --> 01:11:51.013]  I can't tell you how many parents I've run into on the street who don't even know who I am, and their child's autistic.
[01:11:51.473 --> 01:11:53.214]  And I say, when did that happen?
[01:11:53.234 --> 01:11:54.594]  18 months, took a third round of shots.
[01:11:55.254 --> 01:11:56.615]  That kid was talking, running, jumping.
[01:11:56.635 --> 01:11:58.115]  Now he doesn't talk, he just sits there.
[01:11:58.135 --> 01:11:58.915]  He's seven years old.
[01:11:59.755 --> 01:12:00.456]  Here's a question.
[01:12:00.736 --> 01:12:06.677]  If you have a septic system, did you know that proper maintenance can save you thousands of dollars in costly and unnecessary repairs?

[01:12:59.574 --> 01:13:01.897]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:13:01.957 --> 01:13:04.159]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:07.103]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:13:07.483 --> 01:13:12.269]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:13:12.609 --> 01:13:16.794]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:13:17.094 --> 01:13:19.416]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:13:19.436 --> 01:13:21.978]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:13:22.318 --> 01:13:24.880]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:13:25.241 --> 01:13:32.847]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:13:33.167 --> 01:13:38.409]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:13:38.569 --> 01:13:41.370]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:13:41.410 --> 01:13:44.852]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:13:45.112 --> 01:13:46.012]  And I got news for you.
[01:13:46.172 --> 01:13:47.473]  You're everyone else.

[01:13:58.792 --> 01:14:01.512]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[01:14:01.753 --> 01:14:05.713]  Are we going to see economic growth, slide into a recession, or at worst, depression?
[01:14:05.893 --> 01:14:07.974]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:14:08.174 --> 01:14:13.195]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[01:14:13.335 --> 01:14:15.095]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[01:14:15.155 --> 01:14:16.495]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[01:14:16.695 --> 01:14:18.155]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[01:14:18.195 --> 01:14:21.276]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[01:14:21.556 --> 01:14:26.577]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:14:26.917 --> 01:14:36.062]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled Ten Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full-color illustrations, weights and measures.

[01:14:38.624 --> 01:14:40.325]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.

[01:14:51.612 --> 01:14:52.452]  This is not a drill.
[01:14:52.472 --> 01:14:53.493]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[01:15:05.543 --> 01:15:06.144]  We're good.
[01:15:24.138 --> 01:15:24.638]  We're good to go.
[01:15:53.304 --> 01:15:56.565]  Okay, we've got Dr. Wakefield on with us.
[01:16:17.981 --> 01:16:19.142]  Where should we start here?
[01:16:19.202 --> 01:16:34.633]  Because what your study showed, what's causing the autism, what is it in the vaccines that's triggering this, we're now entire wings of public schools are for children drooling in the corner as the shots increase, the retardation...
[01:16:35.871 --> 01:16:35.991]  Okay.
[01:16:57.722 --> 01:17:19.197]  The first study showed that there is an unsuspected bowel disease in children with autism, that there is inflammatory bowel disease in children who were historically thought to have a psychological or psychiatric problem and that was really the main crux of the finding in the original study in eight of the ten
[01:17:19.972 --> 01:17:28.179]  Children and the parents made a clear association between the onset of symptoms and exposure to the MMR vaccine.
[01:17:32.242 --> 01:17:37.086]  But, looking at your study and other studies, what is happening in the intestine?
[01:17:38.493 --> 01:17:49.538]  Well, I mean, just to sort of back that up, now, in five countries of the world, the same bowel disease has been confirmed in the US, in Venezuela, in Italy, in Canada and the UK.
[01:17:49.578 --> 01:17:52.199]  So, is there a bowel disease in children with autism?
[01:17:52.219 --> 01:17:54.360]  I think, absolutely, the answer is yes.
[01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:58.382]  So, we confirmed, it has been confirmed that what was reported in the Lancet is right.
[01:17:59.102 --> 01:18:00.703]  And then the question is, well, why?
[01:18:00.903 --> 01:18:03.184]  And our speculation was that
[01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:14.887]  Measles virus or some part of that vaccine but most likely the measles virus was producing injury to the intestine and there are reasons to suspect that that's the case.
[01:18:14.907 --> 01:18:15.687]  Is it happening?
[01:18:15.727 --> 01:18:18.569]  We don't know but we need to look at it and we certainly can't
[01:18:19.258 --> 01:18:22.099]  Brush it under the carpet, because it's an uncomfortable question.
[01:18:22.139 --> 01:18:23.859]  Now, at the moment, the jury's out.
[01:18:24.219 --> 01:18:28.480]  Some studies say yes, there is evidence of measles, and other studies say no, there isn't.
[01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:32.541]  But that's why they're angry, is because other studies are confirming what you've said.
[01:18:32.581 --> 01:18:38.803]  But regardless, we suddenly have these children in 18 months with a third round of shots in multiple countries.
[01:18:38.823 --> 01:18:44.844]  They get the MMR, and they're not saying, hi, mommy, hi, daddy, puppy, kitty, I want to go play at the park.
[01:18:45.405 --> 01:18:46.845]  You know, junior is bye-bye.
[01:18:48.237 --> 01:18:48.878]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:18:48.938 --> 01:18:52.640]  And the most important question of all is why are there so many sick children?
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:56.083]  Why are there so many parents reporting the same story?
[01:18:56.103 --> 01:18:57.163]  I just got back from China.
[01:18:57.824 --> 01:18:59.025]  In China they had no autism.
[01:18:59.065 --> 01:19:03.388]  Apparently now they've got between 4 and 5 million children with autism.
[01:19:03.428 --> 01:19:07.851]  They estimate one home, I was told, about 3,000 children alone.
[01:19:07.991 --> 01:19:09.672]  But they've no idea what to do with them.
[01:19:09.812 --> 01:19:11.714]  The story there is exactly the same.
[01:19:11.734 --> 01:19:16.757]  So these are not parents who are on the internet or communicating with parents in the US, making it up.
[01:19:17.057 --> 01:19:17.538]  They tell
[01:19:18.418 --> 01:19:26.143]  Well, it's like if horses drink out of a poison pond and all the horses fall over dead, you know there's poison in the pond.
[01:19:26.163 --> 01:19:28.345]  I mean, this is 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:19:28.705 --> 01:19:29.726]  Something's going on.
[01:19:30.589 --> 01:19:35.792]  Yeah, no doubt at all and I think the wrong questions have been asked by the government.
[01:19:35.892 --> 01:19:48.138]  They're trying to avoid even questioning the safety of vaccines and they've been mandated by the government to look at vaccine safety in the context of autism and they're doing everything they can to avoid that.
[01:19:48.258 --> 01:19:49.579]  Now you have to ask why?
[01:19:50.359 --> 01:19:50.620]  Why?
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:54.962]  Surely in the interests of children's health you would want to know whether there's a link or not.
[01:19:55.837 --> 01:19:59.863]  It's only to protect the vaccine programme by maintaining public confidence.
[01:19:59.963 --> 01:20:03.888]  But no, they seem not to wish to look at these issues.
[01:20:06.075 --> 01:20:13.260]  And to be clear, you're a surgeon and a expert who researches, you know, the gut, the stomach, the intestines.
[01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:14.461]  I mean, that's your specialty.
[01:20:15.522 --> 01:20:21.085]  And, you know, you did these studies and now they're claiming that you've engaged in fraud.
[01:20:21.366 --> 01:20:24.228]  But then when you read the articles, they never show any evidence of fraud.
[01:20:24.248 --> 01:20:25.989]  They just say you're a fraud.
[01:20:26.910 --> 01:20:34.515]  Yeah, and it's interesting that the claim of fraud has come from a freelance journalist who has absolutely no training whatsoever in science.
[01:20:36.211 --> 01:20:46.434]  He has gone into the media and made up the most extravagant stories that when even the most mundane analysis failed to substantiate.
[01:20:47.114 --> 01:20:56.376]  And it's very, very sad that in pursuing their case against me, the government's PR campaign in the UK has bought into this notion.
[01:20:58.151 --> 01:21:03.533]  Well, Doctor, we're going to come back and talk about how they lied about you, and I don't think you have to get your good name back.
[01:21:03.573 --> 01:21:16.099]  The mainstream media is so discredited now, worldwide, that the fact that they're attacking you is only heaping credit to your name, and that your research is verified by other research.
[01:21:16.999 --> 01:21:22.402]  But I'm going to bring up the $64 million question when we come back, which is the question you posed.
[01:21:22.642 --> 01:21:26.664]  Why do they know this is happening, and are they intensifying it?
[01:21:27.685 --> 01:21:29.726]  We'll get your answer to that.
[01:21:29.866 --> 01:21:31.526]  Dr. Andrew Wakefield is our guest.
[01:21:31.927 --> 01:21:40.150]  I'm going to open the phones up specifically for families who have children with autism and their experience.
[01:21:40.170 --> 01:21:40.770]  800-259-9231.
[01:21:42.711 --> 01:21:46.332]  We'll be right back with Dr. Andrew Wakefield.
[01:21:46.352 --> 01:21:46.832]  Stay with us.
[01:21:50.213 --> 01:21:51.114]  We're on the march.
[01:21:51.614 --> 01:21:53.215]  The empire's on the run.
[01:21:54.135 --> 01:21:56.836]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:00.131 --> 01:22:02.734]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:22:03.155 --> 01:22:08.122]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:22:08.482 --> 01:22:10.224]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:22:10.545 --> 01:22:15.371]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:22:15.531 --> 01:22:16.492]  How much do you want?
[01:22:16.713 --> 01:22:17.454]  When do you want it?
[01:22:17.834 --> 01:22:19.415]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:22:19.715 --> 01:22:20.536]  When will you need it?
[01:22:20.776 --> 01:22:22.837]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:22:22.997 --> 01:22:24.078]  Will there be any food?
[01:22:24.318 --> 01:22:25.659]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:22:25.859 --> 01:22:30.923]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:22:31.123 --> 01:22:34.265]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:22:34.705 --> 01:22:38.207]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:22:38.527 --> 01:22:39.507]  How much will you need?
[01:22:39.748 --> 01:22:40.348]  We don't know.
[01:22:40.648 --> 01:22:41.548]  How much do you want?
[01:22:41.749 --> 01:22:42.489]  All you can get.
[01:22:42.689 --> 01:22:43.529]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:22:43.770 --> 01:22:46.531]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:22:46.831 --> 01:22:48.572]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:22:48.592 --> 01:22:49.532]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:22:59.195 --> 01:23:00.457]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:23:00.497 --> 01:23:05.864]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:23:06.084 --> 01:23:10.730]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:23:11.111 --> 01:23:11.511]  It's true.
[01:23:11.591 --> 01:23:16.157]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:23:16.678 --> 01:23:21.381]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:23:21.902 --> 01:23:23.823]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:23:24.203 --> 01:23:28.826]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:23:29.026 --> 01:23:29.927]  And here's the best part.
[01:23:30.127 --> 01:23:32.909]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:36.511]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:23:36.832 --> 01:23:39.673]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:23:40.014 --> 01:23:41.915]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:23:42.235 --> 01:23:43.156]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:23:46.798 --> 01:23:48.579]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:55.543]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:23:55.863 --> 01:23:58.244]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:24:00.796 --> 01:24:04.437]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:24:04.757 --> 01:24:12.879]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:24:13.639 --> 01:24:17.660]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:29.062]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:24:29.702 --> 01:24:38.730]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:24:39.231 --> 01:24:44.275]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:24:44.656 --> 01:24:51.822]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:24:52.142 --> 01:24:54.905]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:25:06.399 --> 01:25:11.141]  By the way, I forgot to add, this book is so important, we only cover the most informative information.
[01:25:11.541 --> 01:25:14.822]  It's available on the online video bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[01:25:15.183 --> 01:25:20.785]  Callous Disregard, Autism and Vaccines, The Truth Behind a Tragedy, Andrew J. Wakefield.
[01:25:21.265 --> 01:25:26.627]  If your grandchildren are about to get married or having children, give them this book.
[01:25:27.688 --> 01:25:44.185]  And while you're at it, send them a few links to pig virus contaminates vaccines, but FDA says no problem, or send them mainstream government documents where they admit hundreds of millions of people were given the SV40 cancer virus in the polio shot, and they admit tens of millions then died from that.
[01:25:45.917 --> 01:25:47.398]  And look, I'll come right out and say it.
[01:25:47.578 --> 01:25:50.098]  I've made the film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:25:50.699 --> 01:25:52.919]  I have the White House Science Czar's own textbook.
[01:25:53.619 --> 01:25:54.660]  They're doing this on purpose.
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:55.700]  These are eugenicists.
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:57.521]  This is population reduction.
[01:25:57.541 --> 01:25:58.761]  They're testing soft kills.
[01:25:59.201 --> 01:26:04.303]  Why would they come out and say it's okay for the Gardasil shot to kill young women?
[01:26:04.943 --> 01:26:10.165]  Why would they come out and say it's okay if tens of millions died of cancer from the SV40 shot?
[01:26:11.505 --> 01:26:14.407]  Why would they, they're setting the precedent to do this out in the open.
[01:26:14.427 --> 01:26:17.688]  Now, Andrew Wakefield, medical doctor, he won't go that far.
[01:26:18.209 --> 01:26:21.150]  He did the studies, separate studies have been done, shown the same thing.
[01:26:21.170 --> 01:26:25.092]  Other medical doctors on, about the same thing with Crohn's disease.
[01:26:25.792 --> 01:26:37.659]  Luckily it doesn't have the early onset and fry the brain, you know, to put it in layman's terms as a doctor, well as many doctors have said here on the radio show, but
[01:26:40.643 --> 01:26:44.019]  You know, I got one person in my office has Crohn's.
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:44.943]  It's almost killed him.
[01:26:46.397 --> 01:26:50.320]  And it's mainline medical research that they're looking at that being vaccine-caused.
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:54.322]  So callous disregard, autism, and vaccines, the truth behind the tragedy.
[01:26:54.723 --> 01:26:56.884]  Dr. Wakefield, look, they know it's doing this.
[01:26:56.924 --> 01:27:00.346]  You said you were just in the trial over in England, the hearings, and got even more documents.
[01:27:00.827 --> 01:27:02.968]  They've known this is going on, what, in 2000?
[01:27:04.389 --> 01:27:11.974]  ABC News got the documents from 2000, and it came out in 2002, I'm sure you're familiar with this, where it was the head of the
[01:27:13.615 --> 01:27:16.497]  Food and Drug Administration saying, I wouldn't give this to my grandkids.
[01:27:16.777 --> 01:27:18.458]  We've got to cover up what this has done.
[01:27:18.518 --> 01:27:20.099]  My God, we've damaged millions.
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:24.242]  And then they lied and said they'd taken mercury out, and of course that's separate.
[01:27:25.623 --> 01:27:32.147]  Most of the doctors we talked to, like Russell Blaylock, they say the mercury is toxic, but it's really a side issue.
[01:27:32.187 --> 01:27:32.688]  They say
[01:27:33.448 --> 01:27:44.051]  It is the adjuvant effect of causing an autoimmune response that causes the miscarriages, that causes the autoimmune response in the intestines, the autoimmune response, the brain swelling.
[01:27:44.671 --> 01:27:48.992]  A lot of children have a convulsion in the car or at home after the shots.
[01:27:49.052 --> 01:27:51.813]  Then cops come and arrest them because there's blood on the brain.
[01:27:52.053 --> 01:27:53.414]  They say they've shaken the babies.
[01:27:53.434 --> 01:27:55.894]  You know, that's a whole other facet to this doctor, isn't it?
[01:27:56.214 --> 01:28:01.796]  How they also persecute people when the soft kill weapon, MMR, really hits them hard.
[01:28:02.256 --> 01:28:04.277]  Then they say, oh, you must have beat your kid!
[01:28:04.297 --> 01:28:07.258]  Yeah, well, I mean, you're absolutely right.
[01:28:07.298 --> 01:28:12.901]  There were cases in England where there were a shaken baby syndrome, the child died, they had hemorrhages.
[01:28:13.461 --> 01:28:20.244]  The pathologists ought to say, look, this is something that could be consistent with the DTP vaccine that he's just had.
[01:28:20.284 --> 01:28:21.725]  They weren't allowed to talk about it.
[01:28:21.845 --> 01:28:25.446]  They were actually forbidden to talk about it in the courtroom.
[01:28:25.486 --> 01:28:27.347]  They couldn't address the vaccine issue.
[01:28:27.387 --> 01:28:31.549]  Now, if you can't bring the evidence into court, what kind of justice is that?
[01:28:32.309 --> 01:28:35.852]  But that's even better!
[01:28:36.212 --> 01:28:39.335]  They get to brain damage the kid and then throw the parents in prison.
[01:28:39.375 --> 01:28:41.936]  This is a wonderful system for a predatory government.
[01:28:41.956 --> 01:28:42.317]  Go ahead.
[01:28:43.086 --> 01:28:59.332]  Yeah, no, I don't, you know, at the moment, Alex, I'm as a scientist and a doctor, I don't know whether, you know, to what extent this is just incompetence or conspiracy, but I do know there is a lot of damage out there that is going, that is being brushed under the carpet and it's unacceptable.
[01:28:59.832 --> 01:29:09.196]  Kids in this country have never been, had so many chronic immune diseases, asthma, eczema, hay fever, Crohn's disease,
[01:29:09.917 --> 01:29:11.722]  Autism, what is going on?
[01:29:11.942 --> 01:29:12.785]  It's a key question.
[01:29:14.392 --> 01:29:30.896]  They will not do is a comparison of vaccinated versus unvaccinated children long-term health outcomes and that the reason they won't do that is of a real concern to me because I think they suspect that it will show that the kids who've been vaccinated are worse off.
[01:29:31.016 --> 01:29:34.717]  Now it may not but do the study that people deserve it.
[01:29:34.877 --> 01:29:40.798]  Parents have every right to expect that study not only should have been done in the past but if not must
[01:29:44.852 --> 01:29:49.835]  Well, Doctor, look, we've had decades of this info coming out.
[01:29:49.975 --> 01:30:01.820]  They know what it's doing, and so we could say in the past maybe it was just incompetence, but now the system clearly knows that vaccines are causing all sorts of problems.
[01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:03.680]  I mean, take Gardasil.
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:06.942]  In the trials, it caused death, but still they came out and
[01:30:07.962 --> 01:30:08.963]  aggressively pushed it.
[01:30:09.404 --> 01:30:16.209]  Can you speak to that and then also the admission that these vaccines are now contaminated with pig viruses?
[01:30:16.390 --> 01:30:17.851]  And you have written on that subject.
[01:30:18.564 --> 01:30:20.185]  Yeah, to break it down, there are two things.
[01:30:20.265 --> 01:30:28.152]  I was at a meeting recently, Alex, one of the speakers was one of the senior scientists involved in the production of the Gardasil vaccine.
[01:30:28.332 --> 01:30:35.658]  She was extremely concerned about the way it had been used, the rapidity with which it had been introduced in America.
[01:30:36.139 --> 01:30:43.625]  She said it was intended for women in third world countries or girls in third world countries who didn't have access to cervical smear screening.
[01:30:44.225 --> 01:30:48.709]  That there was no evidence that it worked and that it was associated with problems.
[01:30:48.809 --> 01:31:03.981]  The reason for introducing it seems to be entirely a commercial one and having spoken to someone who worked at work at Insider, there were problems in the trial as you've alluded to from very early on.
[01:31:04.121 --> 01:31:11.587]  So, and I read the other day, it's just been withdrawn or suspended in India where girls died after administration.
[01:31:12.566 --> 01:31:17.627]  There is a problem and please the government cannot just ignore this.
[01:31:18.427 --> 01:31:29.970]  The recent debacle over the pig viruses in a rotavirus vaccine, again this is a vaccine in England, no one uses rotavirus vaccine, why is it necessary in the US?
[01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:38.392]  So we have a vaccine and then after they say it's been extensively tested for safety, years later it's been given to millions of children, then they find
[01:31:38.792 --> 01:31:40.693]  That it's contaminated with pig viruses.
[01:31:40.753 --> 01:31:47.516]  So when they find that the Glaxo vaccine is contaminated with what's meant to be a non-injurious vaccine, they withdraw it.
[01:31:47.576 --> 01:31:48.656]  They suspend it from the market.
[01:31:49.336 --> 01:32:03.902]  Then they find, a couple of months later, that the Merck vaccine is contaminated not just with the pig virus, type 1 virus, but the type 2 virus, which is known to be a pathogen dangerous in pigs, and they put them both back on the box.
[01:32:05.359 --> 01:32:10.564]  How can they possibly say, as they did, that the benefits outweigh the risks?
[01:32:10.624 --> 01:32:13.968]  They have no idea what the risks are whatsoever.
[01:32:13.988 --> 01:32:15.850]  That is a totally dishonest statement.
[01:32:16.191 --> 01:32:20.836]  It is a lie, and it is a misrepresentation to the consumer and the American people.
[01:32:21.411 --> 01:32:44.869]  Well, the way Dr. Blaylock discusses it is that when you inject a bunch of RNA mixed with adjuvants that jack up the immune system on top of it, that the stomach and the intestines is really the front line of our autoimmune system and that it just causes all sorts of bizarre interactions and that this has been known for over a hundred years.
[01:32:45.689 --> 01:32:47.871]  And that they're fully aware of what they're doing.
[01:32:47.891 --> 01:32:56.419]  I mean, Dr. Blaylock comes right out on the show, and he of course reads the documents, and says this is a population reduction program.
[01:32:56.439 --> 01:32:58.561]  But I don't expect you to go that far.
[01:32:58.601 --> 01:33:03.205]  I know you've already been demonized for simply doing the basic research.
[01:33:03.265 --> 01:33:10.832]  Let's briefly, though, talk about their false charges against you, and then what's actually in the book, Callous Disregard, and how important it is
[01:33:12.233 --> 01:33:23.956]  You know, for people to support you, because I've done separate research, and I know that you've actually been tame in what you've said, and it's because you are so measured and well-researched and effective that they're so scared of you.
[01:33:23.976 --> 01:33:28.217]  But, I mean, let's talk about, again, countering their attempted demonization of you, Doctor.
[01:33:28.817 --> 01:33:29.077]  Right.
[01:33:29.117 --> 01:33:36.939]  The principal charge against the doctors was that we conducted unethical research without the appropriate approvals on children.
[01:33:36.999 --> 01:33:39.880]  We exploited children for the purpose of experimentation.
[01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:53.246]  What we actually did was listen to and respond to parents who were concerned about sickness in their very, very, very ill children who had been historically ignored by the medical system.
[01:33:53.806 --> 01:34:00.889]  We put together a multidisciplinary team to assess these children, to investigate them and diagnose them clinically.
[01:34:01.548 --> 01:34:06.174]  And what they have done in England is to misconstrue that as experimentation.
[01:34:06.294 --> 01:34:06.895]  It was not.
[01:34:06.995 --> 01:34:15.125]  And the contemporaneous documentation absolutely confirms that these children were being investigated for clinical reasons.
[01:34:15.585 --> 01:34:21.032]  You do not need an approval from an ethical committee for clinical investigation.
[01:34:21.584 --> 01:34:29.133]  Well, my dad's a dentist, and he's got patents and things on just treatments for, say, dry socket.
[01:34:30.134 --> 01:34:34.739]  And that's how it works, is you say to a patient, do you want to be part of a study?
[01:34:34.759 --> 01:34:36.160]  We're going to pay you this money.
[01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:37.242]  And then you do it.
[01:34:38.010 --> 01:34:43.953]  Right, let me be absolutely clear that Alex, no patient was ever paid by anyone for being in the study.
[01:34:43.973 --> 01:34:46.474]  No, I know, but that's not even unethical.
[01:34:46.574 --> 01:35:01.801]  Everybody knows that the big pharma companies, and everybody pays, but they're saying on the news, they're trying to claim you paid them so it's unethical to be able to do a test on them, and they're acting like you were Dr. Mingala or something when you did extremely ethical studies.
[01:35:02.181 --> 01:35:05.443]  I mean, my point is, knowing how medical trials work,
[01:35:06.583 --> 01:35:09.625]  You did nothing wrong, and they're misconstruing what you did.
[01:35:10.465 --> 01:35:18.510]  Yes, it seems to me they're deliberately misunderstanding the evidence that is in front of them, and it was an extraordinary decision to have come to.
[01:35:18.530 --> 01:35:22.832]  We were all, I have to say frankly, amazed that they could reach that decision.
[01:35:22.872 --> 01:35:31.777]  They either completely misunderstood it, or they had come to a predetermined decision based upon government pressure and media misreporting.
[01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:33.791]  Well, they're desperate.
[01:35:33.871 --> 01:35:38.879]  I mean, would you agree that there is a mass awakening to the dangers of vaccines going on right now?
[01:35:39.585 --> 01:35:55.648]  Yeah, I think this is something they find particularly difficult to cope with, that despite everything they've done to me, despite all the public relations that have been attacking me and the parents and other doctors, there was a study recently that showed that one in four parents in this country thinks vaccines cause autism.
[01:35:55.668 --> 01:36:02.709]  In other words, their public relations campaign has failed because that is without any counter-public relations campaign from our side.
[01:36:03.229 --> 01:36:05.810]  I haven't been in the media before because I haven't been able to be in the media.
[01:36:05.830 --> 01:36:07.510]  I haven't been able to get these facts out there.
[01:36:08.050 --> 01:36:11.651]  Well, Dr. Wakefield, during the H1N1 situation, all I asked people to do was to read the vaccine insert.
[01:36:12.251 --> 01:36:14.031]  It said, may cause neurological disorder.
[01:36:14.051 --> 01:36:14.531]  It said, may
[01:36:36.050 --> 01:36:39.694]  Reduced fertility, it said, may be linked to cancer.
[01:36:40.155 --> 01:36:46.582]  So, I mean, everybody knows vaccines have, quote, adverse reactions.
[01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:52.634]  Yeah, I think the swine flu really needs to be brought out of the open.
[01:36:52.654 --> 01:37:02.823]  Here we were persuaded through a mass public relations campaign of fear and intimidation that there was going to be the worst epidemic of the nastiest flu ever and we had to get this vaccine.
[01:37:02.883 --> 01:37:06.326]  It turned out to be one of the mildest influenza viruses on record.
[01:37:06.707 --> 01:37:09.149]  The vaccine seems to have caused far more problems.
[01:37:09.489 --> 01:37:14.411]  By the way, your book is now published just for a week or so, and it's what, 23 on the Amazon chart, shooting up charts everywhere else.
[01:37:14.431 --> 01:37:15.212]  Give folks the best website.
[01:37:15.232 --> 01:37:16.112]  Is it callous-disregard.com?
[01:37:16.132 --> 01:37:18.333]  Is that the best site for folks to visit, Doctor?
[01:37:37.042 --> 01:37:37.884]  Well, here's the thing, Alex.
[01:37:37.944 --> 01:37:43.714]  If people go on in the next 24 hours onto Amazon.com and buy it there, it goes to the top of the Amazon bestseller list.
[01:37:43.794 --> 01:37:47.541]  And it's gone from... It's literally... It was published yesterday, in fact.
[01:37:47.741 --> 01:37:48.463]  It's now gone.
[01:37:49.790 --> 01:37:50.590]  Up to number 25.
[01:37:51.070 --> 01:37:55.912]  So if you want to buy it today, next 24 hours, go to amazon.com, buy it there.
[01:37:56.732 --> 01:38:07.394]  And if you want to buy it after that, then go to callous-disregard.com and anything that we raise in that proportion of that will go to Autism Research.
[01:38:08.495 --> 01:38:08.995]  Absolutely.
[01:38:09.015 --> 01:38:14.956]  I want to take some phone calls, but promise now, because you live in Austin, that the next month or two you'll come and be in studio with us.
[01:38:16.977 --> 01:38:17.877]  You've got to keep me away.
[01:38:18.037 --> 01:38:18.657]  I'd love to come and see
[01:38:19.088 --> 01:38:19.588]  Absolutely.
[01:38:19.628 --> 01:38:21.410]  We can't wait to have you here with us.
[01:38:21.430 --> 01:38:22.671]  We don't have a lot of time left.
[01:38:22.691 --> 01:38:23.671]  This segment and the next.
[01:38:23.952 --> 01:38:26.493]  And I want to go to a few calls here for you, Dr. Wakefield.
[01:38:26.754 --> 01:38:28.455]  But again, we appreciate your courage.
[01:38:28.895 --> 01:38:34.039]  We appreciate you standing up and speaking out through the ridiculous demonization.
[01:38:34.079 --> 01:38:39.363]  But to be specific then, you literally did studies in your own office
[01:38:40.163 --> 01:38:43.005]  We pursued our professional and moral duty and we stand by everything we did, yes.
[01:38:57.111 --> 01:38:59.912]  And as you said, other studies are showing similar responses.
[01:38:59.952 --> 01:39:02.574]  So, well, that's the thing about the mainstream news articles.
[01:39:02.594 --> 01:39:04.394]  They never really say what you did.
[01:39:04.414 --> 01:39:07.316]  They just say you're bad somehow and unethical.
[01:39:09.117 --> 01:39:18.101]  And I guess it's another political move, just like the British government exonerating Tony Blair, lying about WMDs.
[01:39:18.901 --> 01:39:20.482]  I guess they're just losing all credibility.
[01:39:22.022 --> 01:39:23.423]  But what are they going to do as more parents
[01:39:38.666 --> 01:39:42.528]  Go take the polio shot and their kid dies of polio, which is in CBS News.
[01:39:42.608 --> 01:39:47.751]  Or they get a Gardasil shot and their daughter convulses and is paralyzed the neck down for the rest of her life.
[01:39:48.231 --> 01:39:51.693]  Or the 18-month-old's giggling, laughing, somebody's listening right now.
[01:39:51.973 --> 01:39:52.753]  They're not going to listen.
[01:39:52.773 --> 01:39:53.434]  They don't believe us.
[01:39:54.434 --> 01:39:55.695]  The child has the shots.
[01:39:55.755 --> 01:39:56.695]  They have a convulsion.
[01:39:56.956 --> 01:39:58.376]  The police take the parents to jail.
[01:39:58.877 --> 01:40:01.118]  I mean, you know, the reason they're going to lose
[01:40:02.256 --> 01:40:09.037]  This PR operation is because as their carnage continues, people are going to wake up and remember that we warned them.
[01:40:10.228 --> 01:40:23.275]  Yes, people are most definitely waking up to the fact, because respectable, mainstream, professional, entirely intelligent people are now realising for themselves that this is affecting their families.
[01:40:23.475 --> 01:40:28.698]  You know, if autism doesn't affect you now, then it certainly will in the future, because the numbers are going up so quickly.
[01:40:29.358 --> 01:40:36.162]  So people are coming to the realisation in the saddest, most tragic possible way, and that is a personal experience of the problem.
[01:40:36.342 --> 01:40:39.584]  And it's just too big now to brush under the carpet.
[01:40:40.626 --> 01:40:44.627]  What do you want to say to those out there that have persecuted you and lied about you?
[01:40:44.647 --> 01:40:47.468]  Because no doubt, doctor, they're going to end up seeing and hearing this interview.
[01:40:47.708 --> 01:40:48.668]  What would you like to say to them?
[01:40:50.209 --> 01:40:53.170]  Well, you know, it's a futile effort because I'm not going away.
[01:40:53.190 --> 01:40:54.250]  The parents aren't going away.
[01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:55.330]  The children aren't going away.
[01:40:55.410 --> 01:40:56.431]  The work will be done.
[01:40:56.451 --> 01:40:57.531]  Truth will come out.
[01:40:58.011 --> 01:41:02.093]  So you're not going to change the history of this one bit.
[01:41:02.193 --> 01:41:06.934]  We will get to the bottom of it, whether it exonerates the vaccines or whether it implicates the
[01:41:07.698 --> 01:41:12.684]  My job as a scientist is to pursue this to its natural conclusion, so that is what I intend to do.
[01:41:20.885 --> 01:41:29.009]  Jenny McCarthy, I've heard vicious talk show host nationally on TV and radio claim that she's just wanting publicity.
[01:41:29.869 --> 01:41:41.575]  No, she has a child who was damaged that she lives with every day and to just show how callous they are to attack a mother who has a sick child
[01:41:42.515 --> 01:41:47.937]  Clearly from the vaccines and to claim that she's doing this for her own publicity.
[01:41:48.357 --> 01:41:50.418]  These people are just heartless.
[01:41:51.098 --> 01:41:55.920]  I mean, you know, have they spent time with the children that have been wrecked by this?
[01:41:57.181 --> 01:42:02.503]  Yeah, because they're unable to deal with the facts of the matter and they go after the person and they have no
[01:42:04.702 --> 01:42:19.754]  Well, you're going to be speaking tomorrow at an important event, and we'll cover that when we come back on the other side.
[01:42:20.074 --> 01:42:28.681]  We'll tell folks how to be there, but bottom line, when you talk to Jenny McCarthy, what is her resolve like under the attack she's been under?
[01:42:29.522 --> 01:42:31.003]  Oh, I think she's absolutely determined.
[01:42:31.144 --> 01:42:36.769]  You know, for mothers like Jenny, a small part of them, a big part of them, in fact, has been damaged and destroyed.
[01:42:36.869 --> 01:42:39.291]  And, you know, mothers will never quit.
[01:42:39.331 --> 01:42:41.213]  They will never, ever, ever give up.
[01:42:41.533 --> 01:42:45.657]  And they are an inspiration to doctors like me to continue the work.
[01:42:47.158 --> 01:42:50.921]  Yeah, they've made a lot of mothers mad, a lot of fathers mad, and they're going to be brought to justice.
[01:42:51.462 --> 01:42:53.063]  Their whole eugenics program.
[01:42:53.083 --> 01:42:55.025]  These people are going to hang high.
[01:42:55.085 --> 01:42:55.846]  Doctors, stay there.
[01:42:59.895 --> 01:43:02.798]  If you suffer from poor sleep, you've gotta try MyPillow!

[01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:39.231]  We just want to get the word out and save children.
[01:46:39.771 --> 01:46:41.552]  You jump in front of a truck to save a child.
[01:46:41.932 --> 01:46:44.213]  Why wouldn't you warn people about these vaccines?

[01:46:51.435 --> 01:46:57.201]  And so you can find out more details on the website ageofautism.com.
[01:46:57.981 --> 01:47:01.044]  But in closing, I wanted to jam in a few calls for our guest.
[01:47:01.064 --> 01:47:03.086]  He's got to leave just here in just a few minutes.
[01:47:03.707 --> 01:47:06.870]  But it's so exciting to know that we will bring these criminals to justice.
[01:47:07.130 --> 01:47:08.791]  They're not going to stop us and they're scared.
[01:47:09.512 --> 01:47:11.274]  John in Michigan, you're on the air.
[01:47:11.314 --> 01:47:11.714]  Go ahead.
[01:47:12.535 --> 01:47:15.518]  Good afternoon, Alex and Dr. Wakefield.
[01:47:15.558 --> 01:47:16.899]  My sister is Mary Toko.
[01:47:18.026 --> 01:47:18.686]  Oh, right.
[01:47:19.686 --> 01:47:20.087]  Indeed.
[01:47:20.267 --> 01:47:21.507]  And I live in Northern Michigan.
[01:47:21.987 --> 01:47:24.327]  I have a cousin that has two children with autism.
[01:47:24.367 --> 01:47:26.288]  Her third child she didn't give the vaccine to.
[01:47:26.308 --> 01:47:31.829]  I have a neighbor who just, well, his daughter lost a child right after the vaccine.
[01:47:31.849 --> 01:47:32.549]  The child died.
[01:47:32.569 --> 01:47:39.191]  A niece that, a son that had, I mean, a niece who had a son that had a reaction to it.
[01:47:39.651 --> 01:47:46.052]  My wife works for Community Mental Health here in Northern Michigan, and it's just, she takes care of the developmental end of the, not the mental.
[01:47:46.539 --> 01:47:48.981]  And it's just rampant through northern Michigan.
[01:47:49.542 --> 01:47:56.048]  These families are so devastated with it and they have hardly any support from the medical industry.
[01:47:56.088 --> 01:48:00.432]  The agency my wife works for, they started a camp for children with autism.
[01:48:01.068 --> 01:48:04.349]  Uh, on the lakes at Torch Lake, and it's just grown.
[01:48:04.409 --> 01:48:06.409]  It used to be a local, but now it's a statewide.
[01:48:06.669 --> 01:48:07.130]  Oh, yeah.
[01:48:07.210 --> 01:48:09.890]  Soon, 90% will have it.
[01:48:09.910 --> 01:48:11.711]  They'll just say, that's the way it is.
[01:48:11.731 --> 01:48:13.351]  50 shots a month.
[01:48:13.871 --> 01:48:15.072]  Ah, everyone can.
[01:48:15.572 --> 01:48:18.512]  And, you know, like geniuses will be able to tie their shoelaces.
[01:48:18.933 --> 01:48:21.113]  Middle giants will be able to talk.
[01:48:21.513 --> 01:48:28.435]  And, you know, like a middle giant with an IQ of 71 points will say, Mommy, is it true that people could once walk?
[01:48:28.615 --> 01:48:33.461]  I mean, I'm being a little bit sarcastic here, but I mean, this is just so sickening.
[01:48:33.501 --> 01:48:34.762]  John, I appreciate your call.
[01:48:35.563 --> 01:48:37.906]  You know, that's a good final question for you, Dr. Wakefield.
[01:48:37.926 --> 01:48:39.367]  I'm going to come back with other calls in a moment.
[01:48:39.768 --> 01:48:40.729]  Sorry he's got to go.
[01:48:41.610 --> 01:48:47.837]  But just the number of children everywhere, I mean, how obvious does this have to get?
[01:48:49.853 --> 01:48:50.053]  I don't
[01:49:10.862 --> 01:49:15.425]  30% of the population, 40% of the population just devoted to the care of children with developmental disorders.
[01:49:15.986 --> 01:49:17.206]  This isn't a productive economy.
[01:49:17.246 --> 01:49:18.567]  There's something going horribly wrong.
[01:49:18.987 --> 01:49:20.068]  It's something that's got to be done.
[01:49:20.108 --> 01:49:21.909]  It's long overdue, so we need to get on and do it.
[01:49:22.910 --> 01:49:23.510]  Absolutely.
[01:49:23.530 --> 01:49:28.373]  Well, Dr. Wakefield, we're going to talk to you again very soon, and I'm glad you're able to speak publicly now.
[01:49:28.673 --> 01:49:30.655]  It's just so important to get this information out.
[01:49:30.995 --> 01:49:37.219]  Callous Disregard, Autism Vaccine, The Truth Behind a Tragedy, amazon.com, infowars.com.
[01:49:37.479 --> 01:49:38.199]  God bless you, sir.
[01:49:38.239 --> 01:49:39.000]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:49:41.618 --> 01:49:43.959]  Wow, that was a very scary interview.
[01:49:44.159 --> 01:49:47.440]  Look, the people running things know exactly what they're doing.
[01:49:47.921 --> 01:49:48.281]  Okay?
[01:49:49.921 --> 01:49:55.364]  I mean, every day I read where another village died after they took the smallpox shot.
[01:49:56.724 --> 01:50:03.047]  A bunch of people died in a village after they took the polio vaccine.
[01:50:04.404 --> 01:50:07.267]  A bunch of kids died after they took this shot, that shot.
[01:50:07.708 --> 01:50:10.451]  And they're just normalizing it where it's just completely normal.
[01:50:10.551 --> 01:50:14.255]  And yeah, you know, we got 10 kids in the neighborhood.
[01:50:14.275 --> 01:50:16.678]  Two of them are dying of cancer right now.
[01:50:16.778 --> 01:50:17.979]  Three of them are autistic.
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:21.523]  The others have got allergies so bad they can't come out of the house.
[01:50:21.543 --> 01:50:22.704]  They're all on medication.
[01:50:22.764 --> 01:50:23.625]  Everything's normal.
[01:50:24.451 --> 01:50:28.374]  And they've got hundreds of new vaccines awaiting approval, and you've gotta take them all.
[01:50:28.675 --> 01:50:30.416]  And I meant to ask Wakefield about this.
[01:50:30.976 --> 01:50:34.079]  What is his concern about the move to make vaccines mandatory?
[01:50:34.479 --> 01:50:38.002]  See, because we're waking up now, they're saying, SWAT teams are coming!
[01:50:38.263 --> 01:50:39.544]  Roll up your sleeve!
[01:50:42.046 --> 01:50:43.607]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:50:53.703 --> 01:50:59.744]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:51:00.104 --> 01:51:07.205]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:51:07.485 --> 01:51:12.066]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:51:20.031 --> 01:51:21.873]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[01:51:48.274 --> 01:51:48.714]  Thank you.
[01:51:52.715 --> 01:51:54.655]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:51:55.095 --> 01:51:57.936]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:52:05.578 --> 01:52:09.084]  The story is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:52:09.164 --> 01:52:09.244]  U.S.
[01:52:09.345 --> 01:52:13.131]  Postal Service expands construction of secret rooms.
[01:52:14.773 --> 01:52:27.263]  Military source fears criminal investigative units will be used as black sites for detainment of Americans in the event of national emergency and declaration of martial law, and we've confirmed they have been drilling at post offices for this.
[01:52:27.664 --> 01:52:35.670]  Now, I should have gone to your calls earlier with Dr. Andrew Wakefield, but we're going to go back to some of your calls right now.
[01:52:36.110 --> 01:52:37.231]  Ron Janus.
[01:52:38.632 --> 01:52:46.418]  Jimmy, Jeff, and others calling in with the problems they've had with their children becoming autistic after they take the inoculation.
[01:52:46.919 --> 01:52:48.780]  Ron in Georgia, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:50.241]  Alex, how are you today?
[01:52:50.802 --> 01:52:52.183]  You know, I'm sick in my stomach.
[01:52:52.303 --> 01:52:54.224]  I know they're poisoning us by design.
[01:52:54.244 --> 01:52:55.785]  They brag about it in white papers.
[01:52:56.166 --> 01:52:57.747]  And I want to bring these people to justice.
[01:52:58.287 --> 01:53:01.109]  Well, I got a first-hand information and experience about that.
[01:53:01.129 --> 01:53:07.374]  I have a 13-year-old boy that was diagnosed autistic from Emory University in Atlanta.
[01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:11.162]  Um, when he was 18 months old.
[01:53:12.262 --> 01:53:23.009]  Thank God my wife at the time, she's recently passed away, um, was a nurse and she had recognized some developmental delays when he was 12 months old.
[01:53:23.069 --> 01:53:30.713]  It took us that long to just get an appointment and get doctors to actually give us permission to get an appointment.
[01:53:30.873 --> 01:53:33.215]  No, what's your boy needs is more shots.
[01:53:33.991 --> 01:53:39.432]  Well, he did have vaccinations up until he was 14 months old, Alex.
[01:53:40.312 --> 01:53:41.893]  And then we discontinued.
[01:53:41.953 --> 01:53:43.593]  Now, I also, he has a sister.
[01:53:43.733 --> 01:53:47.354]  Yeah, normally the third round is when they really destroy your child.
[01:53:47.794 --> 01:53:50.315]  And that's why they're so happy to get that third round in there.
[01:53:50.335 --> 01:53:51.635]  But I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:53:52.235 --> 01:53:57.116]  He has a sister that's 11 months old, or younger than him, who has never been inoculated.
[01:53:57.136 --> 01:54:00.137]  In fact, I've talked to you before about her, about the papers that she's written.
[01:54:02.563 --> 01:54:05.325]  She has never had a needle in her arm, ever.
[01:54:05.706 --> 01:54:14.132]  Well I meant to, that's great news, I meant to go over this with Dr. Wakefield, of course they're just going to release bio-attacks that we're not immune to and say, see you need the shots, but this is what these criminals do.
[01:54:15.133 --> 01:54:20.077]  But I should have gone into Wakefield, what they found, you know, the treatments are to reverse this.
[01:54:20.457 --> 01:54:25.301]  I've talked about it with other doctors, but I wanted to get his view on it, but go ahead.
[01:54:26.862 --> 01:54:31.545]  If you would have seen this kid ten years ago, and see this kid today,
[01:54:33.069 --> 01:54:34.010]  Totally different kid.
[01:54:34.330 --> 01:54:35.711]  How were you able to reverse it?
[01:54:35.911 --> 01:54:37.572]  How were you able to reverse their soft kill?
[01:54:38.613 --> 01:54:43.316]  I don't have any scientific proof, but we went through the gluten-free, casein-free diets.
[01:54:43.376 --> 01:54:45.557]  We went through the no dairy.
[01:54:45.637 --> 01:54:50.160]  We went through occupational, physical, speech therapies.
[01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:56.825]  We went through... I even... We even went through the... He was so violent at one time, he got kicked out of a six...
[01:54:57.708 --> 01:54:59.269]  Child autism class.
[01:55:00.649 --> 01:55:01.569]  But that's beautiful.
[01:55:01.630 --> 01:55:02.630]  You stayed with him.
[01:55:02.710 --> 01:55:03.590]  You worked through it.
[01:55:03.870 --> 01:55:06.231]  And they didn't get to chemically destroy your child.
[01:55:06.471 --> 01:55:07.612]  That's one soul.
[01:55:07.852 --> 01:55:12.374]  They didn't get to suck dry in their bloodletting Nazi operation.
[01:55:12.654 --> 01:55:13.374]  God bless you.
[01:55:13.434 --> 01:55:14.234]  Very exciting.
[01:55:14.594 --> 01:55:17.035]  Ron, glad that you got your son back.
[01:55:17.295 --> 01:55:20.216]  I'm glad these murderers didn't get their hands on him.
[01:55:20.257 --> 01:55:21.777]  I can't wait to get our hands on them.
[01:55:22.217 --> 01:55:23.938]  Janice in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:55:25.444 --> 01:55:27.889]  Hello Alex, I had a question for Dr. Wakefield.
[01:55:27.909 --> 01:55:33.119]  I gave my daughter, well my daughter got the MMR vaccine in 1985 in the UK.
[01:55:36.078 --> 01:55:38.519]  And at age 20, she developed Crohn's.
[01:55:39.239 --> 01:55:42.039]  And I'm wondering, can onset be that late?
[01:55:42.439 --> 01:55:43.180]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:55:43.220 --> 01:55:43.680]  No, no, no.
[01:55:44.460 --> 01:55:46.240]  It's been proven in study after study.
[01:55:47.420 --> 01:55:51.341]  Thank God your daughter didn't get the massive brain damage.
[01:55:51.701 --> 01:55:52.802]  It just attacked the gut.
[01:55:53.222 --> 01:56:03.264]  And Crohn's is completely connected to the autoimmune disease, the response, because your stomach wall is meant to take on viruses and bacteria as a buffer.
[01:56:03.764 --> 01:56:14.528]  So it takes on these engineered viruses that start living there and then your body has an autoimmune response and basically Crohn's, for those that don't know, it's like you have poison ivy of your intestine.
[01:56:14.848 --> 01:56:19.409]  Your body recognizes it as an outside threat and starts attacking your own intestines.
[01:56:20.810 --> 01:56:22.611]  Okay, well thank you.
[01:56:22.751 --> 01:56:25.031]  Another little gift from the New World Order.
[01:56:25.331 --> 01:56:26.492]  So how's your daughter doing now?
[01:56:28.047 --> 01:56:29.188]  She's doing better.
[01:56:29.208 --> 01:56:30.609]  I mean, she's doing fine.
[01:56:31.129 --> 01:56:35.612]  When she doesn't eat, and then she eats a lot, she'll, like, have an accident in her pants.
[01:56:35.652 --> 01:56:39.234]  I mean, she's a beautiful girl, and it's, like, so embarrassing for her, and it's just awful.
[01:56:39.314 --> 01:56:40.154]  Well, you know what?
[01:56:40.174 --> 01:56:41.275]  Just let her know who did it to her.
[01:56:41.315 --> 01:56:42.276]  You can get all the documents.
[01:56:42.616 --> 01:56:46.638]  And I'm sorry to hear... Well, you heard me talking about Crohn's and Wakefield.
[01:56:47.139 --> 01:56:50.461]  That's because... Just do Crohn's Disease Vaccination Link.
[01:56:51.201 --> 01:56:52.843]  And the globalists love it!
[01:56:52.943 --> 01:56:54.805]  They enjoy hurting you!
[01:56:55.165 --> 01:56:56.526]  They love murdering you!
[01:56:56.546 --> 01:56:58.188]  They love debilitating you!
[01:56:58.228 --> 01:56:59.009]  They enjoy it!
[01:57:03.641 --> 01:57:04.562]  Tyranny is here.
[01:57:04.902 --> 01:57:08.664]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:57:08.784 --> 01:57:11.086]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:57:11.246 --> 01:57:16.509]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:57:16.949 --> 01:57:23.173]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:57:23.593 --> 01:57:29.135]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:57:29.576 --> 01:57:33.257]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:57:33.757 --> 01:57:37.759]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:57:38.039 --> 01:57:43.581]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:57:43.981 --> 01:57:46.963]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:57:47.543 --> 01:57:48.963]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:57:49.524 --> 01:57:49.964]  It's here.

[02:00:16.728 --> 02:00:20.811]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.352 --> 02:00:30.397]  Okay, my friends, I don't like to get into a subject like this without giving you other pieces of the puzzle.
[02:00:31.601 --> 02:00:48.264]  Four years ago, we got secret documents that are now mainstream news and confirmed to be real, where they're training now over 50,000 preachers for gun confiscation to tell their flocks to go to the relocation centers, to take forced inoculations, to do whatever the government tells them, Romans 13.
[02:00:48.324 --> 02:00:50.085]  They're called Clergy Response Team.
[02:00:50.705 --> 02:00:56.006]  The Infra Guard hiring private citizens to spy on their neighbors with shoot-to-kill orders.
[02:00:56.946 --> 02:01:02.453]  The John Warner Defense Authorization Act, the different executive orders, all for martial law.
[02:01:03.053 --> 02:01:05.536]  The gun confiscation drills, you've seen all of it.
[02:01:05.736 --> 02:01:08.700]  We're going to put this on screen for presentplanet.tv viewers.
[02:01:09.541 --> 02:01:09.821]  U.S.
[02:01:09.861 --> 02:01:14.166]  Postal Service expands construction of secret rooms.
[02:01:14.366 --> 02:01:16.188]  Now, Steve Quayle called me this morning.
[02:01:16.889 --> 02:01:23.212]  And he talked about how Al Cuppett had given him the info on the secret interrogation rooms being expanded.
[02:01:23.713 --> 02:01:24.813]  I called Paul Watson.
[02:01:24.873 --> 02:01:34.898]  He did deep searches on Google, but also on other search databases and found United States Postal Service interrogation rooms.
[02:01:35.298 --> 02:01:40.881]  But we have the internal blueprints where they're expanding these with these big one-way windows.
[02:01:41.822 --> 02:01:45.204]  And Watson did find what my memory had pulled up.
[02:01:46.204 --> 02:01:52.908]  That during the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act, remember 2002, they wanted to have forced inoculation nationwide for smallpox?
[02:01:53.369 --> 02:01:56.331]  And it came out in news articles that, oh yeah!
[02:01:57.239 --> 02:02:11.950]  The feds are going to use sports stadiums and postal offices as the centers where if you refuse to be inoculated, you'll be taken and be held, but will also forcibly inoculate if we're given the orders at these injection facilities.
[02:02:12.431 --> 02:02:17.955]  And then it turned out police and sheriff's deputies were the ones that were leaking the info.
[02:02:18.576 --> 02:02:19.997]  So we know this is real.
[02:02:20.017 --> 02:02:21.158]  So that's why when Steve called me,
[02:02:21.838 --> 02:02:24.139]  I went, yeah, no, this ties into all the info I have.
[02:02:24.179 --> 02:02:30.502]  And he said, listen, this isn't just Al Cuppett, who's a good source, worked for the Joint Chiefs of Staff that gave me this info.
[02:02:30.542 --> 02:02:38.987]  He said, I was already told this last week by one of my sources in Montana who was in one of these facilities and they're expanding it now.
[02:02:39.567 --> 02:02:47.091]  You tie that in with all the military reports of them doing gun confiscation drills and military checkpoints in the news.
[02:02:48.069 --> 02:02:55.912]  They'll have these PR pieces, these acclamation pieces, like, oh, the Marines were out running checkpoints looking for drunk drivers in California or Tennessee.
[02:02:56.392 --> 02:02:58.333]  Oh, the regular army was out in Kentucky.
[02:02:59.154 --> 02:03:02.775]  Oh, the local police are training for martial law.
[02:03:03.675 --> 02:03:07.017]  The point is, they're getting ready to implode the economy.
[02:03:07.597 --> 02:03:09.758]  They've built this over the last few decades.
[02:03:10.218 --> 02:03:11.979]  They have the legislation introduced.
[02:03:12.339 --> 02:03:17.041]  They have the 10 regional FEMA governors under federal control with the National Governors Act.
[02:03:18.524 --> 02:03:27.532]  All this is in place, and now Steve has gotten, and by the way, we called the numbers and called the addresses, you know, pulled up the numbers on the addresses.
[02:03:27.752 --> 02:03:31.696]  We're going to go through that PDF file for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:03:32.056 --> 02:03:37.782]  If you go to the article and link through, we have a PDF document there in the second paragraph.
[02:03:39.642 --> 02:03:44.404]  And we'll scroll down so they can see it, so they can actually see the diagrams in that PDF.
[02:03:45.444 --> 02:03:51.707]  Yeah, there you have it, where you can see the different blueprints for these huge interrogation rooms.
[02:03:51.747 --> 02:04:00.671]  And what's a big concern is, multiple sources say they've got the cover claiming this is for Postal Inspector Criminal Investigations, though no one's ever heard of it.
[02:04:01.331 --> 02:04:02.731]  That's the cover for building it.
[02:04:03.092 --> 02:04:09.153]  We know, even in mainstream articles, these are for forced inoculations and federal police interrogations.
[02:04:09.173 --> 02:04:13.155]  So I want to go to Steve Quayle, who is hot on the trail of this.
[02:04:13.475 --> 02:04:14.695]  Steve, good to have you back with us.
[02:04:14.995 --> 02:04:15.615]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:04:15.635 --> 02:04:30.380]  The interesting thing about this story that is breaking today with you and I, and others especially, many thanks to Al Cuppett, is last week I ran into a gentleman that obviously knows who I am, and he started opening up about the work he's been doing on different
[02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:41.749]  Not only post offices, but the Department of Homeland Security facilities and federal buildings for, you're going to love this, literally silent rooms called interrogation rooms.
[02:04:42.170 --> 02:04:45.392]  And this guy knows what's going on and he's a security specialist.
[02:04:45.692 --> 02:04:54.780]  They said, Steve, what these guys are building are nothing more than absolutely, and he said in his words, they are rendition centers.
[02:04:55.180 --> 02:04:56.922]  Now we know what rendition means, torture.
[02:04:57.322 --> 02:05:13.926]  And we also know the fact that based on what multiple witnesses throughout the country are saying, is everything is being geared up and the level of not only secrecy, but of cordoning off these areas, Alex, with more guards and everything, is indicative of something that's getting really
[02:05:14.346 --> 02:05:16.967]  Yeah, now they're staffing it, that's the big concern.
[02:05:17.027 --> 02:05:20.789]  Remember, Bush started the secret arrest, the snatch-and-grab, the torture.
[02:05:21.189 --> 02:05:33.894]  Now Lieberman and McCain are on the news trying to pass laws, the Belligerent Act, where the Pentagon can direct citizens who are secretly arrested, secretly stripped of their rights, and can be given, quote, enhanced interrogation.
[02:05:34.154 --> 02:05:38.656]  And then it turns out Obama overseas has been using new black sites
[02:05:39.036 --> 02:05:42.682]  At horse ranches and foreign post office facilities.
[02:05:42.982 --> 02:05:44.905]  So they love the nondescript building.
[02:05:45.166 --> 02:05:49.072]  They bring you in in the back of a postal truck and take you into the torture facility.
[02:05:49.508 --> 02:05:49.908]  Absolutely.
[02:05:49.948 --> 02:05:53.510]  Now I want to read a quick update from a friend of mine.
[02:05:53.690 --> 02:05:54.930]  I'm not going to disclose the city.
[02:05:54.970 --> 02:05:55.590]  You know what it is.
[02:05:55.991 --> 02:05:57.111]  But just for his friend's sake.
[02:05:57.131 --> 02:06:03.293]  Steve, my best friend works in a major Midwest area post office distribution facility on the north side.
[02:06:03.614 --> 02:06:07.135]  He has spoken of this mysterious room that was described in your expose.
[02:06:07.415 --> 02:06:12.437]  He said it's closely guarded by the postal police and only a few management members are granted access.
[02:06:12.817 --> 02:06:16.939]  It's located on the second floor of the facility and the only access is by a catwalk.
[02:06:17.399 --> 02:06:19.040]  I always wondered what it was about.
[02:06:19.340 --> 02:06:21.201]  Wait until I tell him what it is all about.
[02:06:21.502 --> 02:06:26.044]  He won't be too surprised because he suspected something bad was happening in there.
[02:06:26.084 --> 02:06:38.972]  So Alex, this is a real-time, today update from a major Midwest city, and the bottom line is that people who even work in the Post Office, the average postal letter carrier is not going to know necessarily what this is for.
[02:06:39.312 --> 02:06:45.716]  But the idea of when, under the Emergency Health Powers Act, remember we were going to have to go to the Post Office to register?
[02:06:46.136 --> 02:06:48.138]  Yeah, that was in the Denver Post.
[02:06:49.158 --> 02:06:50.239]  And Paul Watson has links.
[02:06:50.259 --> 02:06:56.663]  They were going to use it as the forced inoculation interrogation centers to see if you're an extremist.
[02:06:57.144 --> 02:07:00.986]  Now they admit everybody's being put on list to control this.
[02:07:01.026 --> 02:07:03.368]  So this fits into everything we already know.
[02:07:03.388 --> 02:07:06.350]  But also we know the feds admit they're growing the opium.
[02:07:06.730 --> 02:07:31.267]  Shipping in the cocaine they can also use these secret facilities in all the big post offices as a place to ship in their drugs and then break it up and then move it out so it'll also be used just like when the CIA rendition plane crashed three years ago with three and a half tons of pure cocaine it turned out that was also a torture plane so they use these for dual use I would imagine there's also going to be narcotics being brought through these
[02:07:32.162 --> 02:07:39.664]  Well, absolutely, and you know, one of the stories you're carrying today, uh, you know, on Prison Planet is former CIA officials admit to faking bin Laden video.
[02:07:40.004 --> 02:07:44.266]  I think people better realize, Alex, where they have been dumb and dumbed down.
[02:07:44.586 --> 02:07:54.169]  They better allow this reality-based information to shake them up and wake them up, because the bottom line is, is that, ladies and gentlemen, you are
[02:07:54.529 --> 02:08:03.618]  If you're listening to this program or listening to me or anybody that's out there screaming at the top of their lungs, you've already probably been categorized as a terrorist.
[02:08:03.658 --> 02:08:08.503]  And you know, Alex, when people didn't speak out against torture, and I went wild over that, so did you.
[02:08:09.864 --> 02:08:15.967]  Listen, they will not care until it's their child, their wife, their husband in those chambers.
[02:08:16.047 --> 02:08:21.510]  And God forbid, I hope that through the exposing of this, people start figuring it out.
[02:08:21.630 --> 02:08:28.954]  And listen, the only way the Luciferians can live is under the cloak of darkness, secrecy, and control.
[02:08:29.494 --> 02:08:37.158]  So, you know, my hat again is off to you for putting the light on the subject matter that you're dealing with, because that's upon us now!
[02:08:37.598 --> 02:08:37.998]  Well, it is.
[02:08:38.058 --> 02:08:39.719]  I want to shift gears just for a moment.
[02:08:40.500 --> 02:08:52.967]  You remember, you were the one that broke the news that a group of private mercenaries run by a felon had taken over areas of Hardin, Montana, the $27 million facility.
[02:08:53.127 --> 02:08:53.707]  I went there.
[02:08:54.628 --> 02:08:55.908]  It was true and even more.
[02:08:56.028 --> 02:08:58.570]  Now, I was sent a photograph
[02:08:59.628 --> 02:09:02.530]  Yesterday and I wasn't gonna cover this this hour, but towards the end.
[02:09:02.570 --> 02:09:05.811]  I'm gonna go ahead and start Because I'm still doing research.
[02:09:05.831 --> 02:09:21.840]  It says I saw this car on I-45 north Toward downtown Houston today at about 9 a.m.. Never saw one of these before he was driving like a bat out of hell It says state tactical on it, and guess what it has the Serbian coat of arms It has a similar name to one that
[02:09:23.041 --> 02:09:40.330]  Hilton has used, and it's tied into Israeli defense companies, and it has the same website design and same look, but we've confirmed they do have these fake police cars now driving around in Houston, and we've almost confirmed it's connected to Hilton.
[02:09:40.350 --> 02:09:44.152]  We're not 100% sure, but it's the same M.O., the same names.
[02:09:44.752 --> 02:09:51.576]  I mean, this is, and the fact that the Feds haven't done anything about Hilton to begin with, this is just insane.
[02:09:53.069 --> 02:09:55.431]  Well, I think, too, that people need to understand something.
[02:09:55.871 --> 02:10:15.965]  The information that I gave about Department of Homeland Security and others, they've got to, I think, every listener has got to recognize that if they don't receive a policeman or a sheriff or a highway cromer or a state trooper, these guys now, under law, Alex, can put on any, if they're under the Department of Homeland Security, they can wear any one of a dozen
[02:10:16.485 --> 02:10:17.646]  Different uniforms.
[02:10:17.986 --> 02:10:20.808]  They're putting them into, they're hiding them in plain sight.
[02:10:21.208 --> 02:10:37.779]  And again, if all of the events that are taking place concurrently don't send the biggest warning that's ever been sounded on talk radio by your program, the bottom line is that there is no more event that can take place except when they drop the hammer.
[02:10:37.899 --> 02:10:40.441]  And ladies and gentlemen, that's why all this information is out there.
[02:10:40.801 --> 02:10:46.305]  Every single politician who has voted for this stuff needs to be recalled on recall petitions immediately.
[02:10:46.325 --> 02:10:46.547]  Idiot.
[02:10:47.332 --> 02:10:50.113]  Well, let's talk about how they could roll out martial law.
[02:10:50.193 --> 02:10:58.274]  Notice, they're talking about nuclear war with North Korea, they're talking about first strikes on Iran, right as the global banking meltdown happens.
[02:10:58.294 --> 02:11:08.696]  We'll talk about that in the second half of the interview, Steve Quayle, but because I was interrupting some, when we come back from break, walk through what your different sources are telling you, and that's the same info I'm getting.
[02:11:09.837 --> 02:11:14.257]  You, this morning, you weren't sure, you were saying, do you know anything about these blueprints?
[02:11:14.397 --> 02:11:16.738]  We went and looked it up, found out indeed it's public,
[02:11:17.358 --> 02:11:24.808]  That they're building these prison facilities inside of the Postal Service.
[02:11:25.449 --> 02:11:27.152]  Paul Watson has links to that in his article.
[02:11:27.232 --> 02:11:27.412]  U.S.
[02:11:27.432 --> 02:11:30.356]  Postal Service expands construction of secret rooms.
[02:11:30.656 --> 02:11:31.938]  This just went up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:42.463]  So we've confirmed this is going on, but the issue is, it's the other things that the people are telling you, who are involved in this, that they're now being staffed.
[02:11:42.883 --> 02:11:44.104]  They're now being expanded.
[02:11:44.124 --> 02:11:45.844]  They're now building bigger ones.
[02:11:46.545 --> 02:11:49.406]  They can wear any patch they want of any agency.
[02:11:50.006 --> 02:11:55.428]  And how they admitted, seven years ago, this is part of the forced inoculation program.
[02:11:55.708 --> 02:11:56.588]  That is confirmed.
[02:11:56.608 --> 02:11:57.808]  Steve Quayles, our guest.
[02:11:58.069 --> 02:11:59.029]  Key info straight ahead.
[02:12:01.864 --> 02:12:03.545]  And you're subject to other police action.
[02:12:04.326 --> 02:12:05.267]  Tyranny is here.
[02:12:05.587 --> 02:12:09.151]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:12:09.171 --> 02:12:11.733]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:12:11.753 --> 02:12:17.198]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:12:17.639 --> 02:12:23.845]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:12:24.275 --> 02:12:29.839]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:12:30.219 --> 02:12:33.921]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:12:34.441 --> 02:12:38.464]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:12:38.724 --> 02:12:44.248]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:12:44.668 --> 02:12:47.570]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:12:48.210 --> 02:12:49.631]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:12:50.192 --> 02:12:50.652]  It's here.

[02:13:00.661 --> 02:13:02.742]  Well, you need to be hardcore prepared.
[02:13:02.962 --> 02:13:04.022]  There is a difference.
[02:13:04.342 --> 02:13:09.943]  To be hardcore prepared, equip yourself with the latest survival gear available at tacktowngear.com.
[02:13:10.204 --> 02:13:13.184]  All Tactown gear has been field tested by Canadian and U.S.
[02:13:13.224 --> 02:13:14.885]  forces, so you know it's tough.
[02:13:15.025 --> 02:13:15.985]  What kind of gear?
[02:13:16.005 --> 02:13:18.845]  72-hour survival kits as low as $55, holsters for $21, and
[02:13:21.186 --> 02:13:21.606]  We're good to go.
[02:13:40.942 --> 02:13:44.326]  Visit TacTownGear.com right now for your preparedness needs.

[02:13:59.668 --> 02:14:00.489]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:14:00.689 --> 02:14:06.016]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:14:06.216 --> 02:14:06.636]  I get it.
[02:14:06.777 --> 02:14:16.108]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:14:16.368 --> 02:14:17.569]  That's not what's happening.
[02:14:17.789 --> 02:14:26.032]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:14:26.252 --> 02:14:29.534]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:14:29.654 --> 02:14:33.716]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:14:33.916 --> 02:14:35.497]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:14:35.517 --> 02:14:38.758]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[02:14:38.918 --> 02:14:43.080]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:44.001]  You should, too.
[02:14:44.181 --> 02:14:45.142]  Find out what they know.
[02:14:45.322 --> 02:14:48.685]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:14:48.705 --> 02:14:48.945]  800-686-2237.
[02:14:48.965 --> 02:14:49.005]  800-686-2237.
[02:14:49.025 --> 02:14:49.225]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:14:59.750 --> 02:15:02.353]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:15:02.754 --> 02:15:07.720]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:15:08.101 --> 02:15:09.823]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:15:10.143 --> 02:15:14.889]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:15:14.889 --> 02:15:15.249]  I think?
[02:15:33.075 --> 02:15:33.395]  Good to go!
[02:16:03.004 --> 02:16:03.465]  Don't worry.
[02:16:03.965 --> 02:16:05.486]  This show is documented.
[02:16:06.027 --> 02:16:08.830]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:16:09.210 --> 02:16:12.753]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:16:13.114 --> 02:16:17.257]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[02:16:17.758 --> 02:16:19.680]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:21.481]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:16:21.501 --> 02:16:22.761]  Steve Quill is our guest.
[02:16:22.801 --> 02:16:25.182]  Okay, Steve, lay it all out.
[02:16:26.142 --> 02:16:34.185]  Why this is such a concern, because it's not like they're just building secret jails, which we went and tracked down and found the government purchase orders.
[02:16:34.745 --> 02:16:35.805]  That's creepy enough.
[02:16:36.206 --> 02:16:44.548]  We know from past mainstream reports they want to use post offices during collapse of society and for forced inoculation.
[02:16:45.169 --> 02:16:45.849]  And go ahead.
[02:16:46.349 --> 02:16:59.059]  Well, also, I think the thing everyone needs to watch is all of the new revelations on the ID, the new push for national ID, the new biometric scanning, the new DNA scanning, the new sampling against your will.
[02:16:59.499 --> 02:17:10.067]  I mean, the point is, Alex, the Post Office is going to become the place where once they generate the false flag in conjunction with, I believe, Iran, in conjunction with North Korea,
[02:17:10.567 --> 02:17:23.218]  I think people need to understand this, that the mainstream press absolutely does not give news, they don't give the truth, and they only give what I would call diversionary entertainment, and let's put that in question marks.
[02:17:23.679 --> 02:17:31.646]  So the point that has to be made clearly is that the identification, the vilification, the nullification, and soon the destruction
[02:17:32.146 --> 02:17:35.429]  Of anyone who is, other than them, is going to take place.
[02:17:35.489 --> 02:17:36.630]  And look, Alex, we've seen it.
[02:17:36.691 --> 02:17:47.641]  The MIAC report, all the different documentation, it doesn't even matter if we can prove historically that false flags are general operating procedure of the power that's in place at the time.
[02:17:48.041 --> 02:17:57.010]  The Korean incident, starting with the sinking of the South Korean ship by North Korea, followed up with massive deployment of some of the state-of-the-art
[02:17:57.510 --> 02:17:59.233]  We're good to go.
[02:18:16.434 --> 02:18:18.976]  The stuff that we hope we never have to use.
[02:18:19.317 --> 02:18:21.038]  He said, use your imagination.
[02:18:21.398 --> 02:18:27.583]  As most people know, Alex, Japan is not thrilled with the idea of a nuclear war in Korea.
[02:18:27.663 --> 02:18:29.464]  And let's look now to the oil spill.
[02:18:29.844 --> 02:18:42.214]  Whether people believe it or not, want to accept it or not, all these things are happening almost in a concerted and a concentrated point in time to generate the massive amount of chaos.
[02:18:42.234 --> 02:18:43.915]  The New World Order thrives on one word.
[02:18:44.455 --> 02:18:46.758]  Out of chaos must come the New World Order.
[02:18:47.118 --> 02:18:55.568]  And so now we've got, uh, every day we've got whether the President of this country, uh, making statements on a new global order.
[02:18:55.788 --> 02:19:04.518]  We're seeing it all, but remember, and this is the thing I think that everyone loses track of, you cannot bring on the New World Order until you do away with the Old World Order.
[02:19:04.918 --> 02:19:06.439]  So the false flag is a given.
[02:19:06.479 --> 02:19:27.394]  I'm also told, and I've been told this by people who live in your area, and you know in Austin you guys have a lot of retired and active duty, you know, special operations people, that again, the idea is that once it starts in the Middle East, and Egypt's already running their tests, war against Israel, Syria, everybody's getting ready for the big one,
[02:19:28.326 --> 02:19:31.848]  And currently with that, it's the divide and conquer policy.
[02:19:32.108 --> 02:19:38.112]  North Korea can absolutely take out Seoul, Korea with their artillery, I think, in under two hours.
[02:19:38.452 --> 02:19:46.817]  So that means we'll disperse and dispatch some of our most technologically advanced stuff that most people don't even want to acknowledge exists, but we'll leave that for another time.
[02:19:47.257 --> 02:19:52.560]  And even those guys that are in the command and control of all the armed services, U.S.
[02:19:52.620 --> 02:19:53.301]  all over the world,
[02:19:53.721 --> 02:19:56.944]  They've been up at a level never before seen.
[02:19:56.984 --> 02:20:04.190]  And what I'm talking about is that most people think that everything that goes out from orders emanates either from the Pentagon or White House.
[02:20:04.611 --> 02:20:05.592]  That's not true.
[02:20:06.252 --> 02:20:09.055]  There is White House approval codes, etc.
[02:20:09.395 --> 02:20:15.801]  But there are very high-ranking military members with ranks that most people don't even know still exist.
[02:20:16.161 --> 02:20:20.184]  That are up, uh, Marshall LaPapa, by the way, is one of the guys named.
[02:20:20.585 --> 02:20:26.770]  And the thing is, is that we're seeing now a building almost to a crescendo, and it's waiting for the shoe to fall.
[02:20:26.790 --> 02:20:37.219]  But while we're waiting for the shoe to fall, whether it's a false flag, or an international incident, or a nuclear war, whatever, the point being is, is that all these centers are being staffed, all the prisons are being staffed.
[02:20:37.579 --> 02:20:41.302]  You know, whether people want to believe that auto carrier cars can be used for human beings or not,
[02:20:42.156 --> 02:20:43.157]  I'm not going to argue the point.
[02:20:43.438 --> 02:20:45.761]  The thing is, we see everything going on.
[02:20:45.841 --> 02:20:47.603]  The vilification of veterans.
[02:20:48.044 --> 02:20:53.031]  That's the one that really threw me off, Alex, because a veteran should have been screaming at the top of their lungs.
[02:20:53.091 --> 02:20:57.056]  Well, Steve, it's admitted they're training for martial law and military law.
[02:20:57.056 --> 02:20:57.476]  I don't know.
[02:21:21.357 --> 02:21:26.361]  And this is all happening at the perfect time with what's going on in the economy as well.
[02:21:27.082 --> 02:21:29.884]  But key article up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:21:30.545 --> 02:21:33.167]  You can also read the PDF document on Steve Quayle's website.
[02:21:33.187 --> 02:21:34.268]  We'll give that to you when we come back.
[02:21:34.848 --> 02:21:35.048]  U.S.
[02:21:35.169 --> 02:21:38.551]  Postal Service expands construction of secret rooms.
[02:21:39.532 --> 02:21:40.673]  And we confirmed this.
[02:21:40.713 --> 02:21:43.796]  We don't just have the documents of some of the secret rooms in different cities.
[02:21:44.276 --> 02:21:46.698]  We have also the news admitting they're building these.
[02:21:46.938 --> 02:21:47.379]  We'll be back.
[02:21:50.143 --> 02:21:53.124]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:21:54.044 --> 02:21:56.864]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:00.185 --> 02:22:02.785]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:22:03.205 --> 02:22:08.166]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:22:08.526 --> 02:22:10.267]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:22:10.567 --> 02:22:15.388]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:22:15.568 --> 02:22:16.528]  How much do you want?
[02:22:16.748 --> 02:22:17.488]  When do you want it?
[02:22:17.868 --> 02:22:19.470]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:22:19.750 --> 02:22:20.591]  When will you need it?
[02:22:20.832 --> 02:22:22.894]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:22:23.034 --> 02:22:24.136]  Will there be any food?
[02:22:24.376 --> 02:22:25.718]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:22:25.898 --> 02:22:30.984]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:22:31.184 --> 02:22:34.308]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:22:34.748 --> 02:22:38.250]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:22:38.570 --> 02:22:39.550]  How much will you need?
[02:22:39.791 --> 02:22:40.411]  We don't know.
[02:22:40.691 --> 02:22:41.611]  How much do you want?
[02:22:41.812 --> 02:22:42.532]  All you can get.
[02:22:42.732 --> 02:22:43.572]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:22:43.833 --> 02:22:46.574]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:22:46.874 --> 02:22:48.635]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:22:48.655 --> 02:22:49.575]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:22:59.226 --> 02:23:00.487]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:23:00.547 --> 02:23:05.890]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:23:06.130 --> 02:23:10.732]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:23:11.133 --> 02:23:16.216]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:23:16.716 --> 02:23:18.537]  So our friends at Solutions from Science
[02:23:18.817 --> 02:23:19.317]  We're good to go!
[02:23:46.843 --> 02:23:48.605]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:23:51.067 --> 02:23:55.572]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:23:55.892 --> 02:23:58.275]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:23:59.451 --> 02:24:02.373]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[02:24:02.453 --> 02:24:04.415]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[02:24:04.535 --> 02:24:07.177]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[02:24:07.277 --> 02:24:09.238]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[02:24:09.499 --> 02:24:10.699]  Okay, here it comes.
[02:24:10.920 --> 02:24:12.521]  But first, the facts.
[02:24:12.821 --> 02:24:14.542]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[02:24:14.742 --> 02:24:16.464]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[02:24:16.744 --> 02:24:20.227]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[02:24:20.427 --> 02:24:27.812]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[02:24:28.172 --> 02:24:28.773]  Sinofresh.

[02:24:48.400 --> 02:24:48.760]  Mention GCN.

[02:24:49.721 --> 02:24:49.981]  It works!
[02:25:07.830 --> 02:25:19.098]  Folks, don't forget that you make this radio slash TV show possible, you make the films possible, the news websites, and plus the books and videos are what are waking people up.
[02:25:19.718 --> 02:25:21.840]  And the population is now ready to be awakened.
[02:25:22.420 --> 02:25:26.243]  Don't tread on me about 10th Amendment, states' rights, democracy versus republic.
[02:25:26.963 --> 02:25:30.905]  You know, where were you in the second American Revolution to restore freedom?
[02:25:30.946 --> 02:25:35.528]  That's what Don't Tread on Me, available on DVD at Infowars.com covers.
[02:25:36.089 --> 02:25:39.051]  PrisonPlanet.tv members can also watch that film.
[02:25:39.511 --> 02:25:41.272]  Invisible Empire, New Order Defined.
[02:25:41.652 --> 02:25:43.293]  Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[02:25:43.894 --> 02:25:55.581]  And by the way, in Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, we went to Hardin, Montana, and I ducked into one of the offices when they gave us a little fake tour, and it had the big maps, the blueprints saying, Alien Detention Center.
[02:25:56.081 --> 02:25:59.144]  Remember, they had said it was going to be a FEMA camp on CNN.
[02:25:59.725 --> 02:26:00.766]  Then they denied that.
[02:26:02.007 --> 02:26:05.391]  And they had a DNA testing room in there when I ducked in.
[02:26:05.411 --> 02:26:08.635]  I mean, I'd flip the camera on, duck in because they wouldn't let me get in.
[02:26:09.175 --> 02:26:11.598]  That's been being posted on YouTube right now.
[02:26:12.098 --> 02:26:14.241]  It's going to be posted in with this article.
[02:26:15.843 --> 02:26:18.205]  With the info Steve Quayle and others gave us.
[02:26:18.905 --> 02:26:21.106]  But I want to be specific here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:26:21.386 --> 02:26:26.709]  Police State 4, the rise of FEMA covers all of the developments that are taking place.
[02:26:26.929 --> 02:26:28.830]  Everyone needs to see this.
[02:26:29.431 --> 02:26:32.613]  When they're taking blood under federal grants at checkpoints all over the country...
[02:26:33.953 --> 02:26:38.998]  Uh, and when they're announcing they're going to arrest citizens without any due process, that is martial law.
[02:26:39.458 --> 02:26:42.000]  It's what increment of martial law are we under.
[02:26:42.300 --> 02:26:44.682]  So we also do need to have your support out there.
[02:26:44.702 --> 02:26:51.728]  888-253-3139 is the toll free number to call and get books and videos or ask about different combos and specials.
[02:26:51.748 --> 02:26:51.788]  888-253-3139.
[02:26:55.512 --> 02:27:01.622]  Or you can see all my films in super high quality and other great films we've been authorized to post at PrisonPlanet.tv like Camp FEMA.
[02:27:01.642 --> 02:27:04.427]  That's going up there this week at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:27:04.467 --> 02:27:06.290]  Not just Don't Tread On Me.
[02:27:07.728 --> 02:27:11.690]  And you can also visit InfoWars.com and get the books, videos, materials.
[02:27:12.350 --> 02:27:15.832]  Because, you know, this is a big nut to crack every month to fund this operation.
[02:27:16.132 --> 02:27:18.993]  But we've been able to do what we've done because of your financial support.
[02:27:19.434 --> 02:27:21.155]  So I want to thank all of you for your support.
[02:27:21.495 --> 02:27:23.376]  Be sure and get the books and videos and materials.
[02:27:23.416 --> 02:27:26.197]  You may already know everything, but your friends and family don't.
[02:27:26.217 --> 02:27:27.257]  So see it as a donation.
[02:27:27.618 --> 02:27:29.899]  Buy the books, buy the videos, and give them to friends and family.
[02:27:30.199 --> 02:27:31.800]  You can make copies of all my films.
[02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:33.562]  Get them out to everybody.
[02:27:33.682 --> 02:27:35.525]  We just want to stop what's happening.
[02:27:35.826 --> 02:27:39.953]  I mean, look at how things get crazier and crazier and crazier by the minute.
[02:27:40.494 --> 02:27:44.781]  And I want to talk about the bigger geopolitical situation with Steve Quayle here with us now.
[02:27:44.821 --> 02:27:46.424]  But Steve, give folks your website.
[02:27:46.943 --> 02:27:52.124]  My website is stevequayle.com, q-u-a-y-l-e dot com.
[02:27:52.164 --> 02:28:00.846]  And Alex, just since we've been on the air together, a guy that's worked on these just sent me an email saying, I've worked on about six of these rooms across the state.
[02:28:01.187 --> 02:28:04.147]  They use them to keep anonymity of the people working in them.
[02:28:04.327 --> 02:28:06.828]  We had to have a 10-year background check.
[02:28:07.128 --> 02:28:07.629]  I'm not lying.
[02:28:20.837 --> 02:28:43.810]  So, interesting, because again, now you've got domestic intelligence being turned internally, we've got the biggest wars potential being, let's say, coming to a focus, and every effort that can be made to ultimately make war against the American people, imprison and torture the American people, and it's all going on in the guise of domestic security.
[02:28:43.890 --> 02:28:44.891]  I've got to tell you, Alex,
[02:28:45.291 --> 02:28:47.393]  That what we're talking about, we're hitting a nerve.
[02:28:47.433 --> 02:28:56.700]  Now also, something that your listeners need to know, in real time, frequency alerts are up on HF radio frequencies for all the American troops on the Korean Peninsula.
[02:28:56.780 --> 02:28:58.381]  The story's coming out on the newswire.
[02:28:58.441 --> 02:29:00.923]  No, no, no, they admit we may have nuclear war.
[02:29:00.983 --> 02:29:02.584]  They admit we're in a war footing.
[02:29:03.225 --> 02:29:04.406]  North Korea could strike.
[02:29:04.466 --> 02:29:10.951]  If North Korea does one thing, including bringing their ships into South Korean waters, South Korea's gonna attack.
[02:29:10.991 --> 02:29:11.792]  I mean, we could see
[02:29:12.532 --> 02:29:18.777]  The start of World War III, and notice how this is happening right on time with the banking collapse.
[02:29:19.037 --> 02:29:30.987]  Absolutely, and what I didn't get a chance to finish that's really critical, is he said, Steve, as an MBT instructor for American Troops in the Area, I can tell you there are more tactical nukes in the area than you can shake a stick at.
[02:29:31.007 --> 02:29:33.829]  So when you said World War III, Alex, that's exactly it.
[02:29:33.869 --> 02:29:35.250]  Now look, here's the deal.
[02:29:35.611 --> 02:29:38.453]  If a banking crisis is worldwide, they have to
[02:29:38.493 --> 02:29:39.073]  We're good.
[02:30:08.473 --> 02:30:08.556]  Yeah.
[02:30:09.622 --> 02:30:10.582]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:30:10.642 --> 02:30:34.408]  Now, this could be averted, but Gerald Cilente, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Webster Tarpley, yourself, every expert we have on, and the RAND Corporation agrees, they said this two years ago, the only way to get their world government, the only way to get the people to stand down and go along with the tyranny is to launch a major war.
[02:30:34.428 --> 02:30:36.368]  And what did the RAND Corporation say in 2008?
[02:30:36.968 --> 02:30:38.369]  Paul Watson wrote an article about this.
[02:30:39.349 --> 02:30:43.711]  They said a theater war, like Iraq, isn't big enough.
[02:30:44.432 --> 02:30:45.792]  Iran isn't big enough.
[02:30:46.293 --> 02:30:49.635]  It needs to be as big as World War II.
[02:30:50.075 --> 02:30:52.056]  Where is the only place to kick that off?
[02:30:52.756 --> 02:30:55.938]  Well, to be as big as World War II, it's got to be in two different areas, at least.
[02:30:56.658 --> 02:30:59.900]  A perfect place to start, Iran and North Korea.
[02:30:59.940 --> 02:31:00.961]  But here's my issue.
[02:31:01.661 --> 02:31:04.943]  We know the Ayatollah Khomeini was brought into power by the West.
[02:31:05.763 --> 02:31:07.464]  Because the Shah wasn't doing what he was told.
[02:31:07.524 --> 02:31:08.565]  That's actually on record.
[02:31:08.925 --> 02:31:11.066]  They had the arms for hostage situation.
[02:31:11.486 --> 02:31:16.509]  Then the Ayatollahs, the Imams, backstabbed the globalists, at least on the surface.
[02:31:16.890 --> 02:31:20.732]  We know nukes were given to Pakistan by Israel, the U.S., and England.
[02:31:20.772 --> 02:31:21.512]  That's on record.
[02:31:22.153 --> 02:31:26.175]  Also, it just came out that Israel was giving them to South Africa.
[02:31:26.335 --> 02:31:26.735]  Why?
[02:31:26.996 --> 02:31:27.956]  To destabilize things.
[02:31:29.477 --> 02:31:35.663]  We know that ABB and Rumsfeld in 96 and then again in 2000 gave the nukes to North Korea.
[02:31:36.003 --> 02:31:39.467]  What is the master geopolitical strategy in that?
[02:31:40.523 --> 02:31:46.849]  Well, the master geopolitical strategy is simply they are going to initiate a global conflagration.
[02:31:47.249 --> 02:31:53.615]  It's going to be billed as the Battle of Armageddon, and not to be confused with the biblical Battle of Armageddon.
[02:31:54.015 --> 02:31:57.098]  And they're going to bring about their solution to the world.
[02:31:57.118 --> 02:32:01.202]  Look, these guys are just the perfect dialectic demons, okay?
[02:32:01.562 --> 02:32:16.335]  They're generating the problem, they're going to provide their solution, and the solution's going to be, quite candidly, that 5.5 billion people, if they have their way, and they're not going to have their way, but if they have their way, they'd like to see 90% of the world's population destroyed.
[02:32:16.716 --> 02:32:22.581]  Now, Alex, if you mix into this the whole situation in the Gulf, why is it that that oil platform
[02:32:23.161 --> 02:32:28.464]  Seemingly, the stories, even the guys that worked on it, you know, I think you covered this, are sequestered.
[02:32:28.904 --> 02:32:37.748]  Why is it that the original stories were SWAT teams, and by the way, those weren't SWAT teams, those were special operations teams that were put on different golf platforms.
[02:32:38.208 --> 02:32:46.632]  Why is it that all this stuff seemingly happened within the last 14 days, if you will, 21 days, and the deal is that it all
[02:32:46.992 --> 02:32:51.558]  It was almost synchronized and coordinated perfectly as if someone flipped on the switch.
[02:32:51.578 --> 02:32:53.741]  My answer to that is someone didn't flip on the switch.
[02:32:54.081 --> 02:32:59.869]  The banking problem is so severe that in essence, I'll sum it up like this.
[02:33:00.289 --> 02:33:05.076]  Every nation in the world is flat-ass and flat-out broke.
[02:33:05.556 --> 02:33:15.058]  The derivatives problem, which we've talked about for a decade and a half, you've talked about, all of the different experts you've interviewed, the guys I've interviewed, they're all saying the same thing.
[02:33:15.098 --> 02:33:23.600]  But as long as the band plays on, the TV stays on, and the inane becomes the expected, people are not going to be thinking.
[02:33:23.660 --> 02:33:26.981]  And so now every single thing is converging.
[02:33:27.481 --> 02:33:34.167]  Every single thing that's been warned about, the police state tactics, the FEMA camps, the torture centers, everything!
[02:33:34.528 --> 02:33:43.897]  And you know, it's amazing because when even the quote, good, seemingly moral people said, yeah, it's alright to torture, I said, how dare you say that?
[02:33:44.217 --> 02:33:51.083]  Do you not understand the case that everything that's being done overseas is going to come back on your shore, on our shore?
[02:33:51.103 --> 02:33:52.385]  And I tell you, Alex,
[02:33:52.965 --> 02:33:54.367]  Shame on America!
[02:33:54.808 --> 02:33:57.872]  Shame on its politicians for not speaking out against torture!
[02:33:58.112 --> 02:34:06.944]  Because the bottom line is when I hear and when I see the documents you're seeing and I hear the reports you're hearing, we hear different reports, similar reports, it makes me furious!
[02:34:08.186 --> 02:34:08.846]  Absolutely.
[02:34:08.866 --> 02:34:10.567]  I've cleared the phone lines.
[02:34:10.647 --> 02:34:12.327]  I'm sorry for those that were holding other subjects.
[02:34:12.407 --> 02:34:24.071]  I want to just take a few calls here for people specifically that have been involved in building these torture facilities, these soundproof secret jails.
[02:34:25.152 --> 02:34:26.112]  Rendition centers.
[02:34:26.892 --> 02:34:37.105]  Absolutely snatch-and-grab centers, and we separately have them on the news saying we want to arrest citizens secretly, we want to have the Pentagon arrest whoever they want, and only an act of Congress can find out where they went.
[02:34:37.405 --> 02:34:39.347]  So that's mainstream news now, folks.
[02:34:39.367 --> 02:34:42.611]  This is really going on, and what better place than the Post Office?
[02:34:42.631 --> 02:34:43.232]  They've admitted
[02:34:43.993 --> 02:34:47.774]  They want to use the Post Office for mass arrest and forced inoculation.
[02:34:48.114 --> 02:34:51.755]  Paul Watson has that in his article at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:34:51.775 --> 02:34:53.755]  So we know they've talked about this in the past.
[02:34:54.356 --> 02:35:07.979]  And then Watson did find a mainline webpage which talks about how the architecture firm IPG Architects constructed the criminal investigative offices within the Macon Post Office in Macon, Georgia.
[02:35:08.539 --> 02:35:14.823]  The new documents describe similar rooms being constructed in Lake Forest, Illinois and other areas of the country.
[02:35:15.323 --> 02:35:27.451]  And you look at these, these are secret dungeons where they can bring you in in the back of a postal vehicle, bag over your head, you're brought in into a catwalk, big sealed door, two-way mirrors.
[02:35:28.712 --> 02:35:30.053]  This is the secret police.
[02:35:30.113 --> 02:35:31.554]  This is the secret America.
[02:35:31.834 --> 02:35:33.295]  And we know the black sites in Europe.
[02:35:33.715 --> 02:35:41.541]  Our postal facilities, and horse ranches, and shut down grocery stores, and shut down auto parts facilities.
[02:35:41.982 --> 02:35:45.124]  And they just take you in there and torture the living daylights out of you.
[02:35:46.225 --> 02:35:49.608]  And this is just an archipelago, a gulag.
[02:35:49.848 --> 02:35:54.972]  Hell, folks, they're on the news telling you torture's good of children to get answers.
[02:35:55.673 --> 02:35:57.154]  And of course, Steve Quayle mentioned this.
[02:35:57.214 --> 02:35:59.235]  Incredible articles up at GCNLive.com.
[02:36:01.357 --> 02:36:02.358]  by Steve Watson.
[02:36:03.139 --> 02:36:07.384]  Former CIA officials admit to faking bin Laden video.
[02:36:07.945 --> 02:36:12.910]  Military PSYOPs took over operation after intelligence project failed to take off.
[02:36:13.631 --> 02:36:17.996]  And the incredible part is this is even in the Washington Post.
[02:36:18.536 --> 02:36:19.558]  Steve, what's happening?
[02:36:19.998 --> 02:36:20.719]  Let me get the number out.
[02:36:21.319 --> 02:36:21.699]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:36:21.719 --> 02:36:28.061]  Quick calls if you've worked in these facilities.
[02:36:28.081 --> 02:36:28.502]  800-259-9231.
[02:36:29.022 --> 02:36:30.762]  Or if you helped build them.
[02:36:31.083 --> 02:36:38.285]  Or if you work in a post office and you've suddenly seen them build a new room or a new building off the structure and you're told not to go in there and it's all locked up.
[02:36:38.565 --> 02:36:39.866]  We want to hear from you.
[02:36:39.886 --> 02:36:39.866]  800.
[02:36:40.106 --> 02:36:41.206]  When we've confirmed it's real.
[02:36:41.606 --> 02:36:42.706]  But the point is we want to hear from you.
[02:36:42.726 --> 02:36:42.787]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:36:47.188 --> 02:36:55.152]  But Steve, what is the issue here, where we knew the government was bringing in narcotics in the 60s, but now they come on the news and say, we're growing the opium, it's a good thing.
[02:36:55.632 --> 02:36:57.833]  Suddenly they're not even hiding things anymore.
[02:36:57.873 --> 02:36:59.273]  They're admitting world government.
[02:36:59.473 --> 02:37:01.374]  They're admitting they ship in the cocaine.
[02:37:01.674 --> 02:37:03.815]  They're just, it's just incredible.
[02:37:03.975 --> 02:37:05.056]  What is happening, Steve?
[02:37:05.356 --> 02:37:08.237]  Well, I think, first of all, they don't care anymore.
[02:37:08.677 --> 02:37:22.683]  Where the cloak of secrecy provided them the ability to do all this stuff and do it with the American people, gladly paying their taxes, you know, going along with the idea that America would never be responsible or be involved in something like this.
[02:37:23.123 --> 02:37:26.384]  It's kind of a gloating session to the same degree that
[02:37:26.884 --> 02:37:31.066]  That, uh, certain sects around the world have to warn you before they kill you.
[02:37:31.427 --> 02:37:33.048]  These guys are perverts.
[02:37:33.248 --> 02:37:34.829]  They're totally perverts, okay?
[02:37:35.089 --> 02:37:38.931]  And they're perverted in the glee they get out of seeing the control.
[02:37:38.991 --> 02:37:41.332]  You know, Alex, you and I have talked about this so many times over the years.
[02:37:41.732 --> 02:37:43.673]  They are truly control freaks.
[02:37:44.074 --> 02:37:49.096]  But the ultimate power of life and death, they actually believe that they're God.
[02:37:49.217 --> 02:37:49.517]  Little G.
[02:37:50.337 --> 02:37:57.142]  And that provides the ultimate base in the conflict for the ultimate showdown in history, and that's what we're heading for.
[02:37:57.462 --> 02:38:06.208]  Look, you've got all the reports coming in from the Middle East, whether Egypt's really preparing to attack Israel, Israel's preparing to hit Iran, Iran's preemptively going to hit Israel.
[02:38:06.748 --> 02:38:09.509]  And Turkey just basically said the United States go to hell.
[02:38:09.809 --> 02:38:13.790]  By the way, we have a lot of nuclear weapons at Incirlik Air Force Base in Turkey.
[02:38:14.030 --> 02:38:20.152]  So the point that I'm trying to make is that the volatility of hotspots... By the way, we're going to go into Chavez land, too.
[02:38:20.572 --> 02:38:21.832]  I mean, that's Venezuela.
[02:38:22.112 --> 02:38:23.073]  We're building for that.
[02:38:23.113 --> 02:38:24.873]  That was the whole purpose of World War III.
[02:38:28.323 --> 02:38:28.944]  Absolutely, Steve.
[02:38:28.964 --> 02:38:32.166]  I want to go to some calls, and we'll definitely have to have you back up in the next few days if you can do it.
[02:38:32.366 --> 02:38:33.627]  It's always hard to get Steve on.
[02:38:33.888 --> 02:38:36.490]  We appreciate him coming on today, but I wanted to bring this up.
[02:38:37.130 --> 02:38:43.215]  Again, they're going to tell the post offices this is for postal inspector investigations, but they've always had those offices.
[02:38:43.255 --> 02:38:44.136]  We've done the research.
[02:38:44.436 --> 02:38:54.344]  These are new, hardened, soundproofed facilities, and they're building them everywhere, and they admit it has the dual use of interrogation and forced inoculation.
[02:38:54.444 --> 02:38:55.325]  That's the issue.
[02:38:56.147 --> 02:39:10.298]  And Alex, if it weren't for all those issues, they wouldn't be bulletproofing the glass, they wouldn't be soundproofing the rooms, and they wouldn't be sequestering the access to only a select few that are involved and allowed access to that.
[02:39:10.358 --> 02:39:11.980]  Look, it's right into your eyes.
[02:39:12.380 --> 02:39:14.342]  They've already declared their whole hand.
[02:39:14.702 --> 02:39:16.523]  It's absolutely happening now.
[02:39:16.904 --> 02:39:19.486]  And the thing is, the question is, what is the trigger point?
[02:39:19.526 --> 02:39:21.527]  That's a question I get asked a hundred times a day.
[02:39:21.928 --> 02:39:24.330]  I do not know the trigger point, but I can tell you this.
[02:39:24.650 --> 02:39:28.592]  Every six-shooter in the room is hammer back and finger on the trigger.
[02:39:29.293 --> 02:39:30.033]  Well, no doubt.
[02:39:30.073 --> 02:39:30.954]  I mean, look at North Korea.
[02:39:30.974 --> 02:39:32.395]  We'll be covering that more tomorrow.
[02:39:32.455 --> 02:39:34.256]  I mean, open talk of World War III.
[02:39:34.796 --> 02:39:37.638]  Is this being used as a political threat to the nation-states?
[02:39:38.058 --> 02:39:43.042]  Pay us the tens of trillions to the bankers, give us a world order, and we'll start World War III?
[02:39:43.362 --> 02:39:49.946]  That's why the globalists gave nukes to Pakistan, nukes to South Africa, nukes to North Korea?
[02:39:50.326 --> 02:39:52.828]  Or will they go ahead and carry it out?
[02:39:53.608 --> 02:39:59.930]  They have to carry it out because, look, the financial meltdown is so now out of control.
[02:40:00.670 --> 02:40:02.150]  And there is no answer.
[02:40:02.190 --> 02:40:03.530]  There is no solution.
[02:40:03.890 --> 02:40:05.851]  You've got 40 million people on food stamps.
[02:40:05.871 --> 02:40:08.612]  You've got the commercial real estate market ready to crash.
[02:40:08.632 --> 02:40:09.632]  And, you know, I get emails.
[02:40:09.672 --> 02:40:13.673]  I don't know if you get these, Alex, or people say, well, it isn't as bad as you guys said it is.
[02:40:13.753 --> 02:40:14.933]  No, it's going to be worse.
[02:40:15.333 --> 02:40:17.374]  And the fact is, is that when you've got a whole
[02:40:19.555 --> 02:40:23.858]  A plethora of information, voluminous in research.
[02:40:24.158 --> 02:40:25.539]  People say, well, I just don't believe it.
[02:40:25.639 --> 02:40:26.600]  It has nothing to do with belief.
[02:40:26.620 --> 02:40:31.564]  Well, there's no doubt they're geared up for World War III and total martial law and gun confiscation.
[02:40:31.604 --> 02:40:32.445]  That's all admitted.
[02:40:32.745 --> 02:40:34.767]  And their finger is starting to squeeze on the trigger.
[02:40:35.067 --> 02:40:37.028]  And hopefully, if we get the word out, we can avert this.
[02:40:37.068 --> 02:40:38.450]  But at least we put the word out.
[02:40:39.170 --> 02:40:42.273]  Terry in Florida, did you work on one of these facilities?
[02:40:43.174 --> 02:40:56.473]  Well, no, I didn't work in it, but it's a branch post office that I go into and it has special rooms and like a jail and soundproof.
[02:40:58.677 --> 02:41:08.604]  And, uh, you know, it's not like a normal post office that I grew up with, so those type of post offices do exist.
[02:41:09.044 --> 02:41:13.768]  Oh, and they admit seven years ago they're going to be used during martial law and forced inoculation.
[02:41:13.988 --> 02:41:15.008]  That's another good point, Steve.
[02:41:15.028 --> 02:41:18.551]  I've noticed a lot of new post offices themselves are like armored prisons.
[02:41:19.193 --> 02:41:28.659]  Absolutely, even the little town I live in, Bozeman, our main post office, everything is done through guard gates going down into, I mean, there are electronic guard gates with passes.
[02:41:29.060 --> 02:41:31.862]  I mean, there's so much stuff going on in little communities.
[02:41:31.902 --> 02:41:37.625]  You know, we're about, I don't know, 40, 50,000 people here, but Alex, everything is being hardened, okay?
[02:41:38.046 --> 02:41:39.767]  And the siege mentality.
[02:41:40.527 --> 02:41:48.953]  In Helena, Montana, we have one of the Federal Reserve Banks, and I mean, the guys that are familiar with what's going on up there, they said, Steve, it's like they're expecting
[02:41:49.073 --> 02:41:55.077]  Well, look, Steve, as you know, for four years, all the big money's been leaving the country.
[02:41:55.097 --> 02:41:59.861]  I mean, in a literal evacuation, John Wayne family is leaving.
[02:42:00.241 --> 02:42:01.822]  I confirm that from Central Texas.
[02:42:01.863 --> 02:42:02.703]  I'll just leave it at that.
[02:42:03.424 --> 02:42:07.367]  And remember three months before the fake flu thing the feds put out?
[02:42:08.067 --> 02:42:15.535]  We had the emergency manager out of Indiana, where the feds came to them and said, we're getting ready for millions dead from the flu, it will happen.
[02:42:15.955 --> 02:42:24.183]  They used that as a smoke screen to get their grid in place, and we confirmed it then out of the Bureau of Cemeteries, was getting ready for it in New York State.
[02:42:24.704 --> 02:42:29.408]  And so clearly, and they told the emergency managers, they said, martial law.
[02:42:30.249 --> 02:42:33.611]  Harden your police stations and fire departments from the citizens.
[02:42:34.012 --> 02:42:39.755]  Now, what is it the government's been planning where they think the citizens are going to be attacking all the police stations, Steve?
[02:42:40.236 --> 02:42:44.859]  Well, first of all, it's going to be the financial shutdown of the country first and foremost, Alex.
[02:42:44.919 --> 02:42:52.024]  Look, you and I did the show the night that one day, let's remind everybody, one day we were at almost a level five fire alert.
[02:42:52.304 --> 02:42:54.605]  The World Health Organization was going to take control.
[02:42:54.885 --> 02:42:56.987]  We were going to go... Stay there, stay there, stay there.
[02:43:00.034 --> 02:43:01.295]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:43:01.335 --> 02:43:06.698]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:43:06.938 --> 02:43:11.541]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:43:11.942 --> 02:43:12.342]  It's true.
[02:43:12.422 --> 02:43:16.985]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:43:17.512 --> 02:43:22.215]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:43:22.736 --> 02:43:24.677]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:43:25.057 --> 02:43:29.661]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:43:29.861 --> 02:43:30.761]  And here's the best part.
[02:43:30.982 --> 02:43:33.744]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:43:34.044 --> 02:43:37.346]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:43:37.666 --> 02:43:40.508]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:43:40.869 --> 02:43:42.750]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:43:43.090 --> 02:43:44.011]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:43:47.642 --> 02:43:49.424]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:43:50.605 --> 02:43:56.390]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:43:56.710 --> 02:43:59.092]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:44:00.051 --> 02:44:04.913]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:44:05.013 --> 02:44:05.793]  What have we got?
[02:44:06.014 --> 02:44:08.134]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:44:08.455 --> 02:44:09.215]  A republic.
[02:44:09.475 --> 02:44:12.056]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:44:12.116 --> 02:44:14.037]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:44:14.377 --> 02:44:16.278]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:44:16.398 --> 02:44:21.760]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[02:44:21.960 --> 02:44:25.602]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:44:25.982 --> 02:44:29.645]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:44:29.685 --> 02:44:30.625]  You're being warned.
[02:44:30.946 --> 02:44:31.766]  We have the facts.
[02:44:31.966 --> 02:44:33.087]  We have the Constitution.
[02:44:33.127 --> 02:44:34.008]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:44:34.048 --> 02:44:34.868]  We have common law.
[02:44:34.928 --> 02:44:37.170]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:44:37.492 --> 02:44:38.152]  Don't answer it!
[02:45:02.469 --> 02:45:10.553]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.

[02:45:18.376 --> 02:45:22.458]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?

[02:45:53.117 --> 02:45:53.298]  That's 800-477-9256.
[02:46:04.035 --> 02:46:13.719]  Folks, Fox News is reporting threatening Mexico tourist ad involving hunting Arizonans on national Mexican tourist websites.
[02:46:13.739 --> 02:46:22.203]  It's got a guy in camo with binoculars saying to the tourist, in Sonora we are looking for people from Arizona.
[02:46:24.206 --> 02:46:33.449]  I mean, Mexico has such an aggressive stance towards the United States and called Iran, demanding we turn in our semi-automatic rifles, you know, because we need to be slaves like the people of Mexico.
[02:46:34.049 --> 02:46:40.511]  I wanted to go to a final call for Steve Quayle here, Steve in New York, but Steve, you were trying to finish your point when we slammed into break there.
[02:46:40.891 --> 02:46:41.312]  Well, right.
[02:46:41.432 --> 02:46:44.737]  I just want to remind everybody the effect that was taking place.
[02:46:44.757 --> 02:46:55.815]  Remember, Alex, the night that we did the show, and I don't know if it was afternoon or night, but it was the afternoon show we did, and we prayed, and it was like everything was scheduled to go under martial law.
[02:46:56.155 --> 02:46:58.157]  Remember the WHO had exerted their authority.
[02:46:58.457 --> 02:47:00.859]  The military was on alert.
[02:47:00.919 --> 02:47:04.362]  The military was giving command signals to everybody that this is it.
[02:47:04.802 --> 02:47:10.807]  And instantly, instantly, within 24 hours, and it was within 24 hours, the whole thing died down.
[02:47:10.867 --> 02:47:12.528]  I'm telling people, do not lose hope.
[02:47:12.989 --> 02:47:18.093]  Pray like you've never prayed before, that the evil deeds of darkness will be exposed to the light.
[02:47:18.533 --> 02:47:20.975]  And seriously, folks, this is the same kind of
[02:47:22.076 --> 02:47:25.620]  Listen, I mean, they're talking about one false move by the South of the North.
[02:47:25.921 --> 02:47:28.163]  They're going to have a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula.
[02:47:28.423 --> 02:47:29.865]  They're talking about going into Iran.
[02:47:29.885 --> 02:47:32.428]  They're talking about global financial meltdown any day.
[02:47:32.909 --> 02:47:40.157]  Clearly, we all need to be praying to God regardless, getting ourselves right with God, because, you know, there are no atheists in foxholes.
[02:47:42.059 --> 02:47:45.202]  The same as we're talking about post offices, it's not just post offices.
[02:47:45.482 --> 02:47:47.625]  They're building Army Reserve Centers.
[02:48:04.369 --> 02:48:09.897]  Heavily fortified center rooms in them, which could potentially go to underground.
[02:48:09.957 --> 02:48:15.165]  Yeah, they've got threat fusion centers merging the military, the police, everything publicly.
[02:48:15.185 --> 02:48:16.186]  That's a good point, Steve.
[02:48:16.823 --> 02:48:19.004]  Well, absolutely, and I want to share something.
[02:48:19.124 --> 02:48:23.585]  You know, this country was supposed to be by the people, for the people.
[02:48:23.665 --> 02:48:25.005]  We're a republic, okay?
[02:48:25.465 --> 02:48:39.469]  But I think it's important for people to understand that as you and I, Alex, are broadcasting right now, there are people that are absolutely giving confirmation and information to different places around the country.
[02:48:39.509 --> 02:48:43.470]  By the way, fusion centers, fusion centers now, the military is linked into all
[02:48:43.510 --> 02:48:45.071]  We're good to go.
[02:49:11.994 --> 02:49:13.354]  Folks, this isn't a joke.
[02:49:13.374 --> 02:49:18.096]  You've got Supreme Court nominees saying ban free speech and ban the Second Amendment.
[02:49:18.316 --> 02:49:21.737]  Anything else, Steve, in New York about how they're hardening all these government facilities?
[02:49:22.437 --> 02:49:25.618]  Well, it's a new facility that they're building right here out my back door.
[02:49:27.098 --> 02:49:31.699]  I was only able to get the evidence by applying for a job there.
[02:49:33.020 --> 02:49:34.400]  I saw the facility.
[02:49:34.520 --> 02:49:38.361]  I couldn't take any pictures because, of course, cameras weren't allowed.
[02:49:39.019 --> 02:49:47.402]  Well, again, Steve, you're right on, because every facility that's being built now is being built for D-Day, whatever day that that's determined to be.
[02:49:47.722 --> 02:49:50.302]  But the point is, is these are military fortresses.
[02:49:50.602 --> 02:49:58.725]  They're being manned with state-of-the-art weaponry, state-of-the-art surveillance, state-of-the-art satellite uplink and downlink capabilities.
[02:49:59.225 --> 02:50:03.208]  Beyond state-of-the-art communications direct to the military.
[02:50:03.588 --> 02:50:07.211]  And Alex, what we are is a nation under siege.
[02:50:07.611 --> 02:50:12.855]  And we are a nation soon to be embroiled in the worst case scenario and nightmare ever imagined.
[02:50:12.875 --> 02:50:15.657]  Yeah, they're locking us down getting ready for World War III.
[02:50:15.978 --> 02:50:19.100]  And during World War III, they're going to attack the American people and outside enemies.
[02:50:19.440 --> 02:50:20.541]  Steve, amazing info.
[02:50:20.581 --> 02:50:23.523]  Thanks for contacting us with these Postal Service
