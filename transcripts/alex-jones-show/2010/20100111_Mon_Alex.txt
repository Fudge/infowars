[00:00:05.842 --> 00:00:06.483]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.144 --> 00:00:08.186]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.907 --> 00:00:10.028]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:11.490]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.251 --> 00:00:13.173]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.193 --> 00:00:17.499]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.066]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.504 --> 00:00:25.365]  It is Monday, January 11, 2010.
[00:00:26.165 --> 00:00:30.146]  We've reached the halfway point in the syndicated radio broadcast.
[00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.147]  We're here live, noon to 4 p.m.
[00:00:32.227 --> 00:00:32.607]  Eastern.
[00:00:32.647 --> 00:00:35.348]  We simulcast the last two hours, 2 to 4 p.m.
[00:00:35.408 --> 00:00:37.709]  Eastern at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:39.049]  We are live there as well.
[00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:44.431]  So, last Thursday, Bloomberg drops this bombshell.
[00:00:44.571 --> 00:00:45.971]  Give me a document shot on that.
[00:00:47.072 --> 00:00:47.492]  Geithner
[00:00:49.827 --> 00:00:53.750]  Geithner's Fed told AIG to limit swaps disclosure.
[00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:02.897]  Now we know Geithner and Paulson and Bernanke and others are all on record.
[00:01:04.718 --> 00:01:05.579]  Are on record.
[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.942]  Over and over and over and over again.
[00:01:10.285 --> 00:01:13.546]  Saying they will not tell you where the money went and who got the money.
[00:01:14.146 --> 00:01:23.590]  Once they went into holding banks, the French, the German, the British, the Dutch, the U.S., the Canadian, and others, the money we know was paid in massive bonuses and served out.
[00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:31.412]  But the private Federal Reserve, the holding company, and the governmental Treasury Department, on record, will not say where the money went.
[00:01:31.473 --> 00:01:38.295]  But it later came out, it was given to the very people running the government that were taking the bailout money.
[00:01:38.655 --> 00:01:46.003]  Now, Geithner was the head of the most important part of the Federal Reserve, the New York Fed, in the fall and winter of 2008.
[00:01:46.043 --> 00:01:46.904]  And that's in Bloomberg.
[00:01:49.938 --> 00:02:06.671]  And he has now gotten in a lot of trouble because internal documents and emails have been released where AIG, one of the big holding companies they use for plausible deniability to divvy out the money themselves, it's come out that the New York Fed told them do not let this be public.
[00:02:07.271 --> 00:02:09.673]  And we separately have Geithner on TV saying don't let it be public.
[00:02:10.074 --> 00:02:11.815]  Now Geithner says he didn't know anything about that.
[00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:12.996]  Plausible deniability.
[00:02:13.336 --> 00:02:19.601]  That is more evidence of fraud when on record he will not let people know and will never talk about it and says I won't tell you.
[00:02:22.925 --> 00:02:25.429]  So the issue here is this is crime.
[00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:29.956]  This is illegal as Judge Napolitano and Ed Schultz and many others on the left and right have pointed out.
[00:02:30.837 --> 00:02:31.878]  And it's bipartisan.
[00:02:31.898 --> 00:02:36.225]  It goes across party lines and shows how the banking dictatorship is the real problem.
[00:02:39.395 --> 00:02:42.838]  It appears that the New York Fed deliberately pressured AIG to restrict.
[00:02:43.078 --> 00:02:44.359]  Guys, give me a document cam shot.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:53.908]  It appears that the New York Fed deliberately pressured AIG to restrict and delay the disclosure of important information, said ISSA, a California Republican.
[00:02:53.948 --> 00:03:00.634]  Taxpayers deserve full and complete disclosure under our nation's security laws, not the beholding of politically inconvenient information.
[00:03:01.594 --> 00:03:02.956]  Geithner had no role
[00:03:04.107 --> 00:03:07.031]  They're saying Secretary Geithner played no role in these decisions.
[00:03:07.112 --> 00:03:15.664]  Meg Riley, a Treasury spokeswoman, said in an email he was recused from working on the involvement, even though he was the head.
[00:03:15.724 --> 00:03:16.385]  He gave the orders.
[00:03:17.401 --> 00:03:17.621]  Yeah.
[00:03:36.661 --> 00:03:39.743]  In the Treasury Department, former head of Goldman Sachs, setting up this fraud.
[00:03:39.783 --> 00:03:43.085]  We have their internal documents from the McClatchy newspapers that got them.
[00:03:43.486 --> 00:03:56.274]  They're setting all this up, and then he says, oh, I'm going to get the money, and then once I'm in government, I'm going to continue the robbery, but I don't have any decision-making in this, even though he runs the Treasury and the New York Fed, the most powerful branch of the Fed.
[00:03:58.076 --> 00:04:01.898]  Geithner, who was tapped by President Barack Obama, took the Treasury job in January 2009.
[00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:05.821]  Mark Hare, a spokesman for the New York-based AIG, declined to comment.
[00:04:10.575 --> 00:04:15.942]  So the New York Fed ordered the cripple insurer not to negotiate for discounts in settling the swamps.
[00:04:16.282 --> 00:04:23.011]  So you have Paul sent it to Treasury and then it continued with Geithner, the Goldman Sachs hood, thug, henchman.
[00:04:24.025 --> 00:04:25.766]  In Treasury, they gotta keep their people in.
[00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:31.107]  Continuing, ordering, this is another key, ordering government policy.
[00:04:31.367 --> 00:04:37.549]  They're setting government policy to pay a hundred cents on the dollar on these fraudulent derivatives they made up out of nothing.
[00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:40.750]  Credit default swaps, insuring it, other systems.
[00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:48.212]  So, they set up the insurance policy, they know it's a scam, they burn the building down and collect money off of it.
[00:04:50.272 --> 00:04:52.993]  They clearly are involved, they ran the operation,
[00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:54.640]  And this is the key.
[00:04:55.501 --> 00:04:57.823]  And they set policy for 100 cents on the dollar.
[00:04:58.143 --> 00:04:59.044]  This is criminal.
[00:04:59.225 --> 00:05:00.166]  These people are criminals.
[00:05:01.087 --> 00:05:05.088]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:07.929]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.030]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.291]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:05:12.411 --> 00:05:13.932]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:05:14.052 --> 00:05:18.373]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[00:06:00.882 --> 00:06:05.124]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:05.424 --> 00:06:06.045]  Number one.
[00:06:06.345 --> 00:06:09.526]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:09.766 --> 00:06:10.327]  Number two.
[00:06:10.627 --> 00:06:15.189]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:15.969]  It's true.
[00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.812]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:21.132 --> 00:06:21.672]  Number 3.
[00:06:21.953 --> 00:06:25.234]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:25.535 --> 00:06:29.277]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:29.457 --> 00:06:29.997]  Number 4.
[00:06:30.257 --> 00:06:32.619]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:36.401]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:36.901]  Number 5.
[00:06:37.482 --> 00:06:41.404]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:41.624 --> 00:06:46.327]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:46.607 --> 00:06:50.652]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:50.772 --> 00:06:52.354]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:52.574 --> 00:06:54.656]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:06:54.816 --> 00:06:57.159]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:01.226 --> 00:07:03.828]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:07:04.228 --> 00:07:09.191]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:07:09.551 --> 00:07:11.292]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:07:11.612 --> 00:07:16.415]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:07:16.615 --> 00:07:17.555]  How much do you want?
[00:07:17.796 --> 00:07:18.536]  When do you want it?
[00:07:18.916 --> 00:07:20.517]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:07:20.797 --> 00:07:21.618]  When will you need it?
[00:07:21.878 --> 00:07:23.939]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:07:24.079 --> 00:07:25.180]  Will there be any food?
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.721]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:07:27.401 --> 00:07:29.322]  You're in quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:32.004]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:07:32.184 --> 00:07:35.406]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:07:35.786 --> 00:07:39.288]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:07:39.608 --> 00:07:40.589]  How much will you need?
[00:07:40.829 --> 00:07:41.449]  We don't know.
[00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:42.650]  How much do you want?
[00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:43.570]  All you can get.
[00:07:43.771 --> 00:07:44.451]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:07:44.851 --> 00:07:47.612]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:07:47.912 --> 00:07:49.032]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[00:07:49.412 --> 00:07:55.174]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:55.434 --> 00:07:58.095]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:07:58.255 --> 00:08:08.918]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.518 --> 00:08:12.499]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:17.407]  He is a big part of fall of the republic.
[00:08:18.088 --> 00:08:20.430]  He is a huge part of the Obama deception.
[00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.253]  He has a doctorate, doctorate of economics.
[00:08:24.474 --> 00:08:25.615]  Also a doctorate in history.
[00:08:26.636 --> 00:08:31.461]  And we're always pleased to have Webster Tarpley on the air with us.
[00:08:32.819 --> 00:08:33.880]  I wanted to get him on.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.103]  We've got Wayne Madsen coming up in the next hour and a host of other big scandals.
[00:08:37.123 --> 00:08:39.325]  We'll also get his take on Bankstergate.
[00:08:39.525 --> 00:08:41.467]  I'm calling it Bankstergate.
[00:08:42.207 --> 00:08:46.891]  And I want people to understand that this is just like Copenhagen.
[00:08:47.111 --> 00:08:48.412]  This is just like Climategate.
[00:08:48.933 --> 00:08:54.478]  If we, the alternative media, really point out the full fraud of this, force it into the mainstream media, this could bring them down.
[00:08:54.938 --> 00:08:58.800]  We have Napolitano on Fox saying Geithner could be indicted for criminal fraud.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:04.363]  We even have Ed Schultz, the Democrat on MSNBC, saying the White House is in trouble on this.
[00:09:04.783 --> 00:09:08.685]  Geithner clearly set policy at the head Fed office in New York.
[00:09:08.725 --> 00:09:09.525]  That's the head office.
[00:09:09.985 --> 00:09:13.267]  He clearly set policy and continued it as Treasury Secretary.
[00:09:13.847 --> 00:09:14.748]  Notice they swapped.
[00:09:14.808 --> 00:09:20.691]  You had Geithner in at the private Federal Reserve, while the former head of Goldman Sachs, both Goldman Sachs executives,
[00:09:21.531 --> 00:09:21.831]  I don't know.
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.162]  Four fraudulent derivatives that they created.
[00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:58.570]  We have the five-part series of McClatchy newspapers with their own internal emails where they knew it was fraud, knew it was going to implode, told people to buy it, to blow out their competition, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and others.
[00:09:59.251 --> 00:10:02.833]  So they would be left as top dogs because they had their people all over government.
[00:10:03.034 --> 00:10:05.075]  So they made money on the way up, money on the way down.
[00:10:05.235 --> 00:10:06.856]  Now Webster Tarpley, I've got him on with us.
[00:10:07.357 --> 00:10:08.397]  I want him to break this down.
[00:10:09.258 --> 00:10:15.742]  For Geithner to come out and say like Sergeant Schultz in Hogan's Heroes, I know nothing, I know nothing.
[00:10:16.062 --> 00:10:24.828]  To have him saying this is asinine when you have this continue clear racketeering by Goldman Sachs in government, out of government.
[00:10:25.128 --> 00:10:33.793]  Webster has always said in both my films last year, the key is AIG as their front holding company to divvy out the goodies worldwide.
[00:10:34.233 --> 00:10:35.935]  So Webster, I want you to go through
[00:10:36.875 --> 00:10:43.977]  What the bankers are doing, and to explain to them, they've stolen the 28-plus trill, several trillion of that directly from the bailout.
[00:10:44.597 --> 00:10:57.180]  But now they want the New London Kilo land grabbing under fake environmentalism, austerity, taxes, and Australia, the same banking group, is laying about half the land off use, is telling farmers, get off, it's going to the banks.
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.921]  I just put a newscast earlier, no compensation.
[00:11:00.561 --> 00:11:10.788]  Excise taxes, sales taxes, value-added taxes, openly going through Congress, total raping, states going bankrupt, being loaned money like they're third-world countries by the same banks.
[00:11:10.848 --> 00:11:13.650]  The banks won't loan to Main Street.
[00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:15.131]  They want the implosion.
[00:11:15.572 --> 00:11:19.774]  Either we expose these frauds, have them indicted, expose them,
[00:11:21.395 --> 00:11:30.479]  Audit, and then abolish the Federal Reserve, give the power back to Congress, and have a true package to get the economy going and a loan to Main Street.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.640]  It's over.
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.141]  We're already into the spiral of inflation.
[00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:35.622]  Might as well print, as you've said.
[00:11:35.642 --> 00:11:37.342]  I tend to agree with you on that facet.
[00:11:37.723 --> 00:11:38.623]  You've got the floor.
[00:11:38.683 --> 00:11:44.546]  I want you to scientifically go through the history of this, the clear crime, where we're going.
[00:11:45.326 --> 00:11:47.507]  Webster Tarpley, economist, thank you for joining us.
[00:11:47.995 --> 00:11:49.076]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:11:49.517 --> 00:11:58.247]  I would propose, let's go back to the issue at the center of these emails, and it is the question of derivatives, first of all, as you correctly point out.
[00:11:58.347 --> 00:12:03.033]  Financial derivatives, paper based on paper, side bets on markets.
[00:12:03.721 --> 00:12:16.848]  And above all, AIG, the world's largest insurance company, that set up during this past decade a hedge fund in London, a deregulated trading operation in London.
[00:12:16.928 --> 00:12:20.931]  And of course, in London, the regulatory environment is non-existent.
[00:12:20.951 --> 00:12:22.932]  There are no rules in London.
[00:12:22.972 --> 00:12:23.852]  New York is bad.
[00:12:23.912 --> 00:12:25.453]  London is even worse.
[00:12:27.094 --> 00:12:27.815]  We're good to go.
[00:12:43.084 --> 00:12:51.990]  Remember, derivatives had been completely illegal from 1936 until 1982 under a New Deal law put through by Roosevelt.
[00:12:52.130 --> 00:13:10.103]  Derivatives were simply illegal, and it took a period of several decades of work by Phil Graham and Wendy Graham and Alan Greenspan and Bob Rubin and Larry Summers, who's in the White House today, making policy for Obama to somehow rehabilitate derivatives and bring them back.
[00:13:10.183 --> 00:13:11.384]  And by the end of all that,
[00:13:12.004 --> 00:13:27.747]  A couple of years ago, we had reached the amazing sum of a derivatives bubble in the world of $1.5 quadrillion, that is to say $1,500 trillion, of which $3 trillion were in this AIG hedge fund.
[00:13:27.767 --> 00:13:34.609]  Now, when this panic started, it was clear that AIG hedge fund in London, AIG Financial it was called,
[00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:36.130]  They could not pay.
[00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:50.440]  These were credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations that connected this London hedge fund of AIG to the entire New York, London, and European banking community.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.842]  So in the middle of this crisis in the fall of 2008,
[00:13:55.501 --> 00:14:09.667]  We have, of course, as you mentioned, Hank Paulson of Goldman Sachs teaming up with Obama and also with McCain and also with Palin, because she supported it too, to bail out the banking system with $700 billion dollars.
[00:14:09.927 --> 00:14:10.668]  And Glenn Beck!
[00:14:11.088 --> 00:14:13.409]  And he's now supporting new taxes to pay the bankers.
[00:14:13.429 --> 00:14:13.609]  Right.
[00:14:14.009 --> 00:14:20.952]  The entire corporate, you know, globalized pro-Federal Reserve, pro-Wall Street gang, they're all there
[00:14:21.883 --> 00:14:24.644]  Cheerleading for this bailout, right?
[00:14:24.664 --> 00:14:29.186]  The TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which is still going on.
[00:14:29.246 --> 00:14:32.707]  So the question was then, where would this money go?
[00:14:32.887 --> 00:14:35.908]  And this was kept secret, and that's the issue.
[00:14:35.928 --> 00:14:37.008]  But let's jump ahead.
[00:14:37.329 --> 00:14:38.729]  Where did the money go?
[00:14:38.849 --> 00:14:40.290]  What is it that they're hiding?
[00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:43.511]  Well, you mentioned the sum of about $27.29 billion.
[00:14:47.232 --> 00:14:56.237]  That is referring to the United States banks that were paid off by the AIG hedge fund in London, thanks to money from the U.S.
[00:14:56.297 --> 00:14:56.797]  taxpayers.
[00:14:56.817 --> 00:14:58.278]  So again, the idea is the U.S.
[00:14:58.318 --> 00:15:12.826]  Treasury, under Paulson, and then under Geithner, but under Paulson is where it starts, they give the money to this hedge fund in London, and the New York Federal Reserve, with Geithner, superintends this process.
[00:15:12.886 --> 00:15:15.588]  And it goes through something called Maiden Lane 3.
[00:15:16.689 --> 00:15:23.863]  And Maiden Lane 3 is a company that they set up for the purpose of funneling money to AIG.
[00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:24.905]  So who gets the money?
[00:15:25.975 --> 00:15:29.737]  First of all, Goldman Sachs gets $13 billion.
[00:15:30.257 --> 00:15:37.260]  It's interesting because at this point the head of AIG is a guy called Liddy, and he's also from Goldman Sachs.
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.701]  Ed Liddy from Goldman Sachs is getting the money from Hank Paul.
[00:15:40.741 --> 00:15:46.964]  They've got their people everywhere in every administration for over a decade setting up this mother of all heists.
[00:15:47.324 --> 00:15:50.305]  And this is Goldman Sachs, alias Government Sachs.
[00:15:51.265 --> 00:15:52.425]  They've taken over the U.S.
[00:15:52.465 --> 00:16:00.227]  government, in effect, because they've got their alumni all over the place, including Bob Rubin and his protege, Larry Summers.
[00:16:00.467 --> 00:16:02.487]  So Goldman Sachs gets $13 billion.
[00:16:02.887 --> 00:16:07.328]  Merrill Lynch, on the way to bankruptcy and being absorbed, gets $7 billion.
[00:16:07.708 --> 00:16:09.449]  Bank of America gets $5.2 billion.
[00:16:10.709 --> 00:16:15.271]  Citibank gets $2.3 billion, Wachovia gets $1.5 billion.
[00:16:15.631 --> 00:16:21.514]  So that's $29 billion to pay off credit default swaps at 100 cents on the dollar.
[00:16:21.554 --> 00:16:26.757]  Now, these credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations were worth about zero.
[00:16:26.777 --> 00:16:29.358]  They might have been worth two or three cents on the dollar.
[00:16:29.518 --> 00:16:31.879]  Yeah, the banks just made these up for themselves.
[00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:34.029]  Yes, they're manufactured out of nothing.
[00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:42.631]  It's basically issuing insurance without meeting the legal requirements to issue insurance, which include capital and so forth.
[00:16:42.671 --> 00:16:43.571]  But now it gets worse.
[00:16:43.971 --> 00:16:46.192]  We've accounted for about $29 billion so far.
[00:16:46.652 --> 00:16:47.992]  But there are foreign banks.
[00:16:48.052 --> 00:16:50.693]  It's not just Wall Street banks, not just Goldman Sachs.
[00:16:50.713 --> 00:16:57.974]  And we've got $50 billion paid to those, and there's evidence that those banks then paid it back into the Goldman Sachs crowd again.
[00:16:58.354 --> 00:17:01.577]  Partly, but yes, and I think that's one of the key motivations.
[00:17:01.617 --> 00:17:04.220]  But let's just give the list of criminals in this case.
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:09.365]  We have Societe Generale of France gets $12 billion.
[00:17:09.705 --> 00:17:13.949]  Deutsche Bank of Germany gets $12 billion.
[00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:19.615]  Barclays Bank of Great Britain, $8.5 billion.
[00:17:20.035 --> 00:17:21.737]  Union Bank of Switzerland, UBS,
[00:17:22.597 --> 00:17:23.138]  $5 billion.
[00:17:23.198 --> 00:17:24.759]  So this is actually more.
[00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:27.000]  This is about $38 billion.
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:32.684]  If you put this together, we get up to the fantastic sum of $67 billion.
[00:17:32.924 --> 00:17:33.544]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:17:33.584 --> 00:17:34.845]  I thought it was $50 billion.
[00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:36.726]  $67 billion, excuse me.
[00:17:36.746 --> 00:17:40.828]  $67 billion by my count, which is about 10% of the entire TARP.
[00:17:40.848 --> 00:17:42.810]  10% of the entire troubled assets.
[00:17:45.191 --> 00:17:51.714]  But if you're running a criminal op though, you want to use one gang, and Goldman Sachs clearly were the captains of this piratical fleet.
[00:18:04.901 --> 00:18:11.524]  Yes, they have been able to get more political influence, but this thing is all intertwined.
[00:18:11.884 --> 00:18:15.846]  So, the idea was then that this should have been stated.
[00:18:15.866 --> 00:18:29.873]  All of the information that I've just gone through, the names of these banks and the billions that they got, should have been stated on a filing which AIG was legally required to make under the Securities
[00:18:30.413 --> 00:18:30.994]  We're good.
[00:18:43.721 --> 00:18:56.708]  AIG, under Lydia Goldman Sachs, sent a first draft of their SEC Schedule A filing, I think it's called, to essentially Geithner's people at the New York Federal Reserve.
[00:18:57.028 --> 00:19:07.593]  And the New York Federal Reserve and their lawyers told AIG, don't make this public now, let's hide this for a while, let's keep this under wraps, because we don't want this to come out.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.261]  And Geithner is sitting on the top of that institution.
[00:19:11.301 --> 00:19:16.542]  Now, so far we don't have, as far as I know anyway, we don't have emails that have Geithner's name on it.
[00:19:16.882 --> 00:19:25.585]  But these are all his stooges, his underlings, his staff, his appointees, people working for Geithner and taking orders from Geithner did this stuff.
[00:19:25.965 --> 00:19:35.114]  And he's using, Webster we got a break, we'll come back and continue, he's using the mafia defense of, oh that was my underlings that committed these murders, that was my underlings that robbed these banks.
[00:19:35.634 --> 00:19:41.820]  He's saying I know nothing, though he was setting the policies as the head of the Fed, lobbying for him, and then as the head
[00:19:42.661 --> 00:19:45.082]  Uh, of, uh, the Treasury Department.
[00:19:45.102 --> 00:19:54.827]  Then we have the separate issues of them selectively using federal regulators they controlled, seizing competition banks, and then feeding and dumping all their debt into there.
[00:19:55.128 --> 00:19:57.089]  I mean, there's just so many crimes they're committing.
[00:19:57.529 --> 00:19:59.430]  We'll go over more of the crimes and where this is going.
[00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:02.271]  Attention!
[00:20:02.451 --> 00:20:17.527]  An important product from hempusa.org, micro plant powder, will change your life by removing all types of positive toxins such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients.
[00:20:17.808 --> 00:20:19.450]  Micro plant powder is 89% silica and
[00:20:20.811 --> 00:20:21.532]  We're good to go.
[00:20:46.092 --> 00:20:46.452]  I think so.
[00:21:01.309 --> 00:21:08.777]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[00:21:09.058 --> 00:21:14.844]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for six bucks or the book for ten bucks.
[00:21:15.144 --> 00:21:17.807]  And we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[00:21:18.087 --> 00:21:24.012]  Here's what you do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.
[00:21:24.372 --> 00:21:25.773]  This book will work for anyone.
[00:21:25.953 --> 00:21:28.215]  Rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[00:21:28.435 --> 00:21:33.819]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:35.901]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[00:21:36.141 --> 00:21:37.482]  You need to look out for yourself.
[00:21:37.882 --> 00:21:40.145]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[00:21:40.405 --> 00:21:44.770]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[00:21:45.131 --> 00:21:48.535]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[00:21:48.855 --> 00:21:51.478]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:21:51.979 --> 00:21:53.400]  That's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:21:53.881 --> 00:21:55.983]  One last time, it's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[00:22:02.885 --> 00:22:03.946]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:04.346 --> 00:22:09.808]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:22:10.389 --> 00:22:10.889]  That's right.
[00:22:11.209 --> 00:22:13.490]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:20.974]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:22:21.534 --> 00:22:29.223]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:29.683 --> 00:22:34.529]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:38.193]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:40.956 --> 00:22:45.079]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:45.700]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.661]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:22:47.722 --> 00:22:48.042]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:48.062 --> 00:22:48.622]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:48.722 --> 00:22:50.444]  When you hear the words water purification,
[00:23:05.657 --> 00:23:06.258]  We're good to go.
[00:23:20.697 --> 00:23:21.297]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:23:21.317 --> 00:23:21.658]  I think so.
[00:23:21.678 --> 00:23:22.038]  I think so.
[00:23:22.098 --> 00:23:22.478]  I think so.
[00:23:45.331 --> 00:23:48.612]  Alright, going back to Webster Griffin Tarpley, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:23:48.712 --> 00:23:54.575]  We're going to continue with the scams they pulled, then how we prosecute them, how we go after these criminals, because they're not going to stop here.
[00:24:15.438 --> 00:24:16.818]  They're the ones setting up NORTHCOM.
[00:24:16.838 --> 00:24:19.639]  They're the ones running the phony environmental movements, grabbing the property.
[00:24:19.999 --> 00:24:21.299]  They openly finance it all.
[00:24:21.399 --> 00:24:22.660]  This is the New World Order.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.020]  This is the globalists.
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.561]  And when we say the Anglo-American establishment, that's what they call themselves.
[00:24:27.601 --> 00:24:28.741]  It doesn't mean white people.
[00:24:29.221 --> 00:24:32.502]  It means the U.S.-British elite power axis.
[00:24:32.962 --> 00:24:34.122]  London and Wall Street.
[00:24:34.602 --> 00:24:37.423]  I get emails all the time going, why are you talking bad about Anglos?
[00:24:37.483 --> 00:24:38.723]  That's not what it is.
[00:24:39.204 --> 00:24:40.484]  It means that geographic
[00:24:41.204 --> 00:24:41.904]  Those cities.
[00:24:42.604 --> 00:25:09.790]  Now, Webster, going back to you here, you were going through Geithner claiming he knows nothing about it, though they've got their people in all the positions, they're setting the policies, he moves into Treasury, continues the 100 cents on the dollar scam, and then separately we have them, you said at the time and now it's been confirmed, Goldman Sachs was gunning the whole time for Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and others that they use government power to shut down and eat
[00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:12.131]  Uh, that's criminal right there.
[00:25:12.171 --> 00:25:13.852]  I mean, it's just, it's all crime.
[00:25:14.773 --> 00:25:34.465]  Yeah, I think the most obvious crime right now is a criminal conspiracy with Geithner as part of it to violate the Securities Act of 1933 by deleting information that AIG had proposed to tell the Securities and Exchange Commission, and these filings become public then.
[00:25:35.005 --> 00:25:38.207]  Here are the banks we gave the money to, and here's how much they got.
[00:25:38.947 --> 00:25:39.868]  We're good to go.
[00:25:59.896 --> 00:26:00.417]  We're good to go.
[00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:16.930]  We're good to go.
[00:26:36.005 --> 00:26:40.128]  To go after Geithner, he should obviously resign or be fired.
[00:26:40.528 --> 00:26:43.470]  And above all, we've got to change the policy.
[00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:48.794]  You look at that $70 billion, let's call it $70 billion, that has been given to AIG.
[00:26:49.074 --> 00:26:52.456]  The actual amount given to AIG, by the way, is more.
[00:26:52.856 --> 00:26:55.498]  It's at least $180 billion.
[00:26:55.898 --> 00:26:59.121]  So it's about a third... Yeah, the number I've seen in the news is $220 billion.
[00:26:59.141 --> 00:27:00.581]  $220 billion.
[00:27:01.022 --> 00:27:04.184]  Going back, Webster, and we'll get into the special prosecutor, because that's essential.
[00:27:04.224 --> 00:27:05.405]  Everybody needs to listen carefully.
[00:27:06.365 --> 00:27:10.827]  Let's not forget, we have record numbers of the Obama administration that don't even pay taxes.
[00:27:11.307 --> 00:27:14.269]  You can't work for the IRS if you have any previous tax problem.
[00:27:14.529 --> 00:27:19.451]  But here's Geithner saying, I don't even have to pay because it's some international money he was making.
[00:27:19.891 --> 00:27:22.092]  I mean, this is just criminals through and through.
[00:27:23.653 --> 00:27:25.294]  This is a criminal gang.
[00:27:25.434 --> 00:27:27.935]  I would call this the Mussolini corporate state.
[00:27:28.515 --> 00:27:29.336]  Here's a good quote.
[00:27:29.716 --> 00:27:40.042]  The liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where the private power becomes stronger than the democratic state itself.
[00:27:40.462 --> 00:27:42.183]  That is the essence of fascism.
[00:27:42.563 --> 00:27:45.565]  The ownership of government by an individual or a group.
[00:27:46.323 --> 00:27:46.903]  Close quote.
[00:27:46.943 --> 00:27:50.165]  That's Franklin D. Roosevelt speaking to Congress in 1938.
[00:27:50.746 --> 00:27:51.746]  And that's what we have here.
[00:27:52.106 --> 00:27:57.730]  That Goldman Sachs and its cohorts in Wall Street have essentially taken over the U.S.
[00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:00.731]  government and they're squeezing it as a cash cow.
[00:28:01.172 --> 00:28:03.713]  Let me hasten to add, it's not just Goldman Sachs.
[00:28:03.833 --> 00:28:06.415]  I would always want to remind people of the Morgans.
[00:28:06.895 --> 00:28:10.917]  Because for 150 years, the heart of Wall Street is Morgan.
[00:28:10.977 --> 00:28:13.739]  In other words, JPMorgan Chase.
[00:28:14.079 --> 00:28:17.361]  The Chase-Manhattan-JPMorgan merger.
[00:28:17.761 --> 00:28:23.645]  They get as much money, or even more, than Goldman Sachs, and they take somewhat less political heat.
[00:28:23.965 --> 00:28:25.986]  Same thing goes for Morgan Stanley.
[00:28:26.026 --> 00:28:27.647]  Morgan Stanley being that other
[00:28:28.007 --> 00:28:40.271]  Yeah, they're the mob bosses back at the palace getting the money, but the men in there robbing the bank at all the key exits, the gang they hired to rob the bank was Goldman Sachs.
[00:28:40.291 --> 00:28:45.693]  Right, so Goldman Sachs is more up front, and of course they deserve whatever they get.
[00:28:45.733 --> 00:28:52.695]  So I think it's clear that there's been a criminal conspiracy, big violations of federal law, but here's the big thing I think.
[00:28:53.542 --> 00:28:55.664]  You look at, for example, California, right?
[00:28:55.704 --> 00:28:56.604]  Or New York State.
[00:28:56.724 --> 00:28:59.847]  All of these states are now in a tremendous budget crisis, right?
[00:29:00.287 --> 00:29:01.548]  Are they going to fire cops?
[00:29:01.708 --> 00:29:04.130]  Are they going to fire the fire department?
[00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:10.695]  NBC reports they're making DMV, Department of Motor Vehicles, people work free every Friday.
[00:29:10.935 --> 00:29:11.936]  That's called slavery.
[00:29:12.281 --> 00:29:23.128]  Yeah, well, so here we had $70 billion, and really, as you say, it's about $220 billion, $200 plus at least, billion, that were given to AIG.
[00:29:23.489 --> 00:29:23.989]  For what?
[00:29:24.449 --> 00:29:35.957]  For toxic derivatives, for garbage, for junk paper that's absolutely worthless, that doesn't correspond to any kind of economic wealth or value under the... Okay, stay there, stay there, Webster.
[00:29:36.017 --> 00:29:36.778]  I want to get into...
[00:29:37.558 --> 00:29:48.466]  Other crimes they've committed, and then how people lobby and push to identify the Wall Street criminals as the literal source, the fount of all of our economic problems.
[00:29:48.766 --> 00:29:50.347]  And where we're going if we don't stop them.
[00:29:51.408 --> 00:29:52.309]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.809 --> 00:29:54.390]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.331 --> 00:29:58.033]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.902 --> 00:30:04.887]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:30:05.007 --> 00:30:07.751]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.

[00:31:00.643 --> 00:31:04.866]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:05.206 --> 00:31:05.806]  Number one.
[00:31:06.106 --> 00:31:09.268]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:09.529 --> 00:31:10.109]  Number two.
[00:31:10.389 --> 00:31:14.952]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:15.292 --> 00:31:15.752]  It's true.
[00:31:16.033 --> 00:31:20.595]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.896 --> 00:31:21.356]  Number three.
[00:31:21.716 --> 00:31:24.999]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:25.299 --> 00:31:29.042]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:29.222 --> 00:31:29.763]  Number 4.
[00:31:30.023 --> 00:31:32.385]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:32.785 --> 00:31:36.148]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:36.469 --> 00:31:36.989]  Number 5.
[00:31:37.249 --> 00:31:41.173]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:41.393 --> 00:31:46.157]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:46.437 --> 00:31:50.479]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:50.599 --> 00:31:52.180]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.482]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:31:54.642 --> 00:31:56.983]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:32:02.349 --> 00:32:05.970]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:14.452]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:32:15.172 --> 00:32:19.213]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:32:19.793 --> 00:32:30.615]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:32:31.255 --> 00:32:40.258]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:40.758 --> 00:32:45.800]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:53.383]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:53.683 --> 00:32:56.084]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:33:04.654 --> 00:33:07.137]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[00:33:07.657 --> 00:33:14.304]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:14.584 --> 00:33:16.146]  Okay, your calls are coming up.
[00:33:16.186 --> 00:33:17.588]  I'm sure they're going to be all over the map.
[00:33:17.688 --> 00:33:21.111]  I would ask listeners to try to talk about the Bankster takeover.
[00:33:21.932 --> 00:33:23.333]  That's what we're discussing right now.
[00:33:23.473 --> 00:33:31.879]  If that's not what you want to talk about, Bankstergate, then please let John Harmon know and I'll go to you later after Webster Tarpley leaves us.
[00:33:31.919 --> 00:33:40.606]  But Kyle, Billy, Dave, Dave, Jacob, and others, or if you want to call in about the Bankster criminal activities and how we stop them, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:41.406 --> 00:33:44.589]  We're going back to Webster Tarpley in just a moment.
[00:33:45.089 --> 00:33:49.553]  Geithner's been caught red-handed in criminal activity, but we can't just let him be a scapegoat.
[00:33:50.413 --> 00:33:51.754]  It is the entire system.
[00:33:51.774 --> 00:33:54.036]  We're going to go back to Tarpley here in one moment.
[00:33:54.076 --> 00:33:57.939]  First, I want to thank some of the sponsors that have made today's radio broadcast possible.
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:02.563]  First off, I want to tell you about MySolarBackup.com.
[00:34:03.404 --> 00:34:09.829]  It is so important for everybody to move towards becoming at least somewhat self-sufficient and truly sustainable.
[00:34:10.249 --> 00:34:13.252]  And this is a great solar powered unit.
[00:34:13.272 --> 00:34:17.835]  You can run your whole house off a bunch of them, but it can run larger appliances by itself.
[00:34:18.776 --> 00:34:22.620]  It's a great little solar panel, a little battery system, and a controller.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.201]  Just a wonderful system.
[00:34:24.241 --> 00:34:27.023]  You can find out more at mysolarbackup.com.
[00:34:27.584 --> 00:34:29.325]  Banner's up on infowars.com.
[00:34:29.365 --> 00:34:37.012]  Again, that's mysolarbackup.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:34:37.052 --> 00:34:39.874]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:40.355 --> 00:34:43.858]  And it's now time to get involved in systems.
[00:34:44.498 --> 00:34:46.920]  And to start training yourself to be more and more self-sufficient.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.741]  Great systems, great for camping as well.
[00:34:48.761 --> 00:34:50.002]  877-327-0365, 877-327-0365 or mysolarbackup.com.
[00:34:50.022 --> 00:34:51.963]  Continuing with sponsors that made today's show possible, Front Sight.
[00:35:01.149 --> 00:35:03.211]  This is Alex Jones, if you heard of the Millionaire Patriot.
[00:35:03.532 --> 00:35:06.275]  He has a free handgun and five days of free firearms training for you.
[00:35:06.635 --> 00:35:13.223]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sights Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[00:35:13.563 --> 00:35:18.869]  Plus, if you act fast, the Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[00:35:18.929 --> 00:35:20.190]  I believe now is the time.
[00:35:20.751 --> 00:35:21.091]  We're good to go.
[00:35:46.659 --> 00:35:49.721]  Okay, going back to Webster Griffin Tarpley, Webster is really saying nothing new here.
[00:35:49.761 --> 00:35:53.683]  He's saying what he said in my film, Fall of the Republic, and the Obama deception.
[00:36:05.731 --> 00:36:09.195]  He's going off the facts, and it's now being proven even by the mainstream.
[00:36:10.096 --> 00:36:14.020]  So Webster, I want to move quickly now just to bullet points, picking your brain here.
[00:36:15.021 --> 00:36:18.104]  Obviously, we need to have a special prosecutor, but not just Congress.
[00:36:18.464 --> 00:36:20.446]  We want grand juries at the state level.
[00:36:21.383 --> 00:36:22.024]  To indict.
[00:36:22.084 --> 00:36:29.249]  We want legislatures that have had their pension funds and other systems defrauded by this who have standing to take action.
[00:36:29.289 --> 00:36:30.590]  We need private suits.
[00:36:31.351 --> 00:36:47.004]  It is lawsuits that have been bringing out the secret AIG and Goldman Sachs documents where they're engaged in fraud and premeditated plans to blow out their competition and make hundreds of billions of dollars off the scam in McClatchy newspapers.
[00:36:47.064 --> 00:36:49.666]  This is all starting to come out, but the public
[00:36:50.882 --> 00:36:52.006]  Doesn't have a great knowledge.
[00:36:52.046 --> 00:36:53.371]  They just know they're being robbed.
[00:36:53.733 --> 00:36:55.038]  And then I add the point that...
[00:36:55.996 --> 00:37:01.760]  It's the banks that run all our major cities that are lobbying for land grabs and more taxes and surveillance.
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.641]  It's the banks that fund the military-industrial complex.
[00:37:04.721 --> 00:37:10.465]  It's the banks that are pushing the global Copenhagen tax, where we'll pay money directly to them.
[00:37:10.825 --> 00:37:20.111]  I mean, they literally are attempting a global takeover with this wall of fiat currency, 1.5 quadrillion that you talk about, or 1,500 trillion.
[00:37:23.573 --> 00:37:44.763]  They are being exposed, they are in trouble, but let's go over more of their crimes, what they've really done, and your expertise in going after these people, the best ways for people to call for their indictments, and other crimes they've committed, so that the public at large is aware, so they can be pushed into the mainstream media.
[00:37:46.021 --> 00:37:49.203]  Well, let's also add another name to our list, right?
[00:37:49.243 --> 00:37:54.587]  Because so far we've talked about Hank Paulson, that was the Bush-Goldman Sachs Secretary of the Treasury.
[00:37:55.107 --> 00:38:02.532]  We're obviously focusing on Geithner, who went from the New York Fed, the flagship of the Federal Reserve System, really the heart of it in terms of policy.
[00:38:03.913 --> 00:38:10.242]  But let's also add Sheila Baird, Sheila Baird of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
[00:38:10.282 --> 00:38:13.567]  Now, this woman is also part of the bailout, right?
[00:38:13.587 --> 00:38:16.150]  The bailout comes from the Federal Reserve under Bernanke.
[00:38:16.651 --> 00:38:20.076]  It comes from the Treasury under Paulson and Geithner.
[00:38:20.516 --> 00:38:24.858]  But then Sheila Baird is the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
[00:38:24.898 --> 00:38:26.018]  Now, she did a couple of things.
[00:38:26.038 --> 00:38:35.641]  We've been talking about how sometimes institutions that are viable in themselves are fed into other bankrupt institutions that are politically better connected.
[00:38:35.741 --> 00:38:39.163]  The leading example of this is Washington Mutual.
[00:38:39.523 --> 00:38:43.144]  And this was the largest savings bank left in the United States.
[00:38:43.704 --> 00:38:44.164]  We're good to go.
[00:39:00.228 --> 00:39:01.068]  But of course J.P.
[00:39:01.108 --> 00:39:02.829]  Morgan was because of derivatives.
[00:39:02.889 --> 00:39:03.209]  J.P.
[00:39:03.249 --> 00:39:06.451]  Morgan is the biggest derivatives black hole in the universe.
[00:39:06.931 --> 00:39:15.315]  So they were, this Wham-O was seized and fed in and the people who had that stock were completely destroyed in the process.
[00:39:15.575 --> 00:39:17.816]  So that's one thing that we want to investigate.
[00:39:18.336 --> 00:39:20.057]  They didn't pay the people off from that.
[00:39:20.197 --> 00:39:35.165]  They seized it with real assets and then the government regulators, run by the JPMorgan Chase slash Goldman Sachs pirate crew, they kept the money and then didn't, even with taxpayer money, pay back the people they'd robbed.
[00:39:35.405 --> 00:39:35.785]  Exactly.
[00:39:35.845 --> 00:39:37.667]  Now, you talked about Bear Stearns.
[00:39:37.727 --> 00:39:40.108]  Bear Stearns was also fed into JPMorgan.
[00:39:40.128 --> 00:39:43.791]  I think Bear Stearns really was bankrupt several times over with derivatives.
[00:39:44.191 --> 00:39:47.793]  Same story for Lehman Brothers, which was then allowed to go bankrupt completely.
[00:39:48.114 --> 00:39:53.257]  But Washington Mutual is a really egregious case, because it's not clear that they were bankrupt at all.
[00:39:53.337 --> 00:39:54.598]  They were probably viable.
[00:39:55.078 --> 00:39:56.399]  And they were fed into J.P.
[00:39:56.439 --> 00:39:58.059]  Morgan to give J.P.
[00:39:58.099 --> 00:40:03.721]  Morgan all of those deposits that they could use to offset some of their toxic derivatives in the long run.
[00:40:04.021 --> 00:40:10.783]  Now the other big thing that Sheila Baird does do or doesn't do at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is the following.
[00:40:11.624 --> 00:40:20.407]  According to the banking laws of the United States, the big banks in Wall Street are bankrupt, bankrupt, bankrupt several times over.
[00:40:20.447 --> 00:40:21.847]  That means J.P.
[00:40:21.887 --> 00:40:23.608]  Morgan Chase, Citibank,
[00:40:24.389 --> 00:40:28.711]  Bank of America, Wells Fargo, a couple of others, right?
[00:40:28.791 --> 00:40:29.931]  Bank of New York, Mellon.
[00:40:30.432 --> 00:40:34.053]  The top six or seven are unquestionably bankrupt.
[00:40:34.433 --> 00:40:47.339]  Now, every Friday, you can pick up an AP wire that says, today the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation shut down the corner bank of Podunk Center in some state.
[00:40:47.679 --> 00:40:52.821]  Some little bank that nobody's ever heard of with a few hundred million of deposits or assets.
[00:40:53.507 --> 00:41:04.157]  The problem is that every Friday we are reminded that Sheila Baird is guilty of a criminal conspiracy not to shut down the zombie bank, because that's what these things are.
[00:41:04.517 --> 00:41:07.920]  The big Wall Street banks are zombie banks, and what I mean by that is this.
[00:41:08.573 --> 00:41:15.318]  We were told when the bailout and the tarp went through, that if you bailed out Wall Street, that would help Main Street.
[00:41:15.418 --> 00:41:23.805]  If you kept the Wall Street banks going, that would mean abundant credit would flow to companies, to industry.
[00:41:23.965 --> 00:41:25.246]  But they haven't been loaning.
[00:41:25.326 --> 00:41:28.989]  By design, they've been shutting down Main Street so they can buy it up.
[00:41:29.289 --> 00:41:31.430]  Right, so what we've got is the U.S.
[00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:33.472]  taxpayer is now funding zombie banks.
[00:41:33.532 --> 00:41:34.732]  What do zombie banks do?
[00:41:35.253 --> 00:41:42.437]  Well, you may have noticed, first of all, that the price of gasoline has gone up about a dollar per gallon in the last 12 months.
[00:41:42.597 --> 00:41:44.158]  And you predicted that a year ago.
[00:41:44.338 --> 00:41:45.038]  And what is that?
[00:41:45.118 --> 00:41:53.801]  That is simply the comeback of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, who bid that up to, you know, almost $5 a gallon or so back in the summer of 2008.
[00:41:54.561 --> 00:41:59.143]  Then they had to sell it off when they were threatened by bankruptcy, and now they're bidding that up again.
[00:41:59.183 --> 00:42:08.566]  So the thanks you get from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for saving them is that they are now bidding up the price of gasoline, and they will bid that up as high as they can.
[00:42:08.606 --> 00:42:09.586]  So that's one thing they do.
[00:42:10.246 --> 00:42:14.310]  Parasitical speculation in the things that you need for your daily life.
[00:42:14.651 --> 00:42:17.554]  The second thing, of course, they do is they clip you.
[00:42:17.594 --> 00:42:23.220]  They clip you with late fees, deposit fees.
[00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.762]  30% credit card rates, loan sharking.
[00:42:25.802 --> 00:42:29.566]  But Webster, worse than that, they're now lobbying the government.
[00:42:30.347 --> 00:42:30.527]  I think?
[00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:53.652]  Oh, who was the other big one?
[00:42:53.712 --> 00:43:04.686]  I saw Rubin come out and call for it, a bunch of others call for higher taxes to pay off debt, much of which is debt accrued by giving them all this money.
[00:43:05.026 --> 00:43:10.033]  So, they're in there running the government to now rape us financially through taxes.
[00:43:10.513 --> 00:43:13.095]  Exactly, and this is the whole secret of Obama.
[00:43:13.195 --> 00:43:21.802]  About one year ago right now, Obama met with the editorial board of the Washington Post, and it's something that I talk about in Surviving the Cataclysm.
[00:43:22.623 --> 00:43:28.527]  Obama said, well, I ran on hope and change, but now I have to change, I have to abandon those things.
[00:43:29.027 --> 00:43:32.450]  Now it's going to be sacrifice and responsibility.
[00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:34.592]  Wait a minute, Wall Street has just gotten
[00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:42.792]  You know, $25 trillion, whatever it is, $27 trillion, and now it's time for sacrifice and responsibility for the American people?
[00:43:43.312 --> 00:43:47.413]  Exhausted, depleted, with our living standard cut already by two-thirds.
[00:43:47.853 --> 00:43:56.075]  If you look at what Obama wants to do with Social Security, and indeed his health care plan, these are bailouts in disguise.
[00:43:56.135 --> 00:43:59.236]  These are bailouts to bail out bankrupt insurance companies.
[00:43:59.376 --> 00:44:01.617]  All the insurance companies themselves owned by banks.
[00:44:01.637 --> 00:44:02.437]  And let me add this.
[00:44:03.177 --> 00:44:09.983]  That's why liberals like Dennis Kucinich and even the chairman of the Democratic Party, Dean, have now read the bill.
[00:44:10.344 --> 00:44:14.067]  It cuts Medicare and Medicaid by 40 plus billion dollars apiece every year.
[00:44:14.588 --> 00:44:17.731]  It puts people in jail who can't afford the insurance.
[00:44:18.231 --> 00:44:20.814]  It gives liability protection to the insurance companies.
[00:44:21.154 --> 00:44:21.815]  I went and looked.
[00:44:21.835 --> 00:44:28.041]  The head lobbyist for the insurance companies admits they wrote the bill, but they give them fake left cover in the media.
[00:44:28.681 --> 00:44:38.572]  Saying insurance companies don't want this bill, we're socking it to the rich guy, and the average moron, street-level idiot actually thinks this health care bill is good.
[00:44:39.093 --> 00:44:47.502]  Yes, the Obama health care plan, as you correctly pointed out, is first of all, it's about $500 billion cut from Medicare over a period of years.
[00:44:48.163 --> 00:45:04.651]  And the idea with that health bill is that you are forced to buy insurance from a private, for-profit, deregulated company, which has golden parachutes, which has lobbying budgets, which has 30 or 40 percent administrative overhead.
[00:45:04.691 --> 00:45:05.391]  Advertising.
[00:45:05.811 --> 00:45:10.134]  And the goal of that is that those companies, in their own way, are just as bankrupt as AIG.
[00:45:10.415 --> 00:45:11.916]  They're insurance companies, too.
[00:45:12.276 --> 00:45:13.037]  What did they do?
[00:45:13.357 --> 00:45:14.458]  They issued derivatives.
[00:45:14.478 --> 00:45:23.945]  You can look at Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, but also then look at Cigna, look at UnitedHealthcare, look at all of those, and you'll see that they're all in the same boat.
[00:45:24.265 --> 00:45:31.411]  It's just that in this case, instead of doing it through the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and the FDIC, they want to do it through you.
[00:45:31.711 --> 00:45:35.354]  That every person in the United States is required to buy a product from these companies.
[00:45:35.954 --> 00:45:38.335]  And that's why their stock is all shot up, Webster.
[00:45:39.315 --> 00:45:40.796]  So Webster, where does it end?
[00:45:40.956 --> 00:45:45.057]  Everything the government does, both parties, is a rape of the American people.
[00:45:45.397 --> 00:45:47.037]  They're openly involved in crime.
[00:45:47.298 --> 00:45:51.139]  If we don't bring them to justice, they're just going to be emboldened for more, more, more.
[00:45:51.219 --> 00:46:00.982]  Wasn't Copenhagen a big defeat of these people because they openly said fake environmentalism would be their ultimate land grab and their carbon tax and a new layer of derivatives?
[00:46:01.382 --> 00:46:04.443]  Aren't they starting to face Waterloo after Waterloo?
[00:46:05.307 --> 00:46:07.188]  Yes, again, I think part of that is international.
[00:46:07.468 --> 00:46:22.695]  My analysis of Copenhagen was it was the Russians who leaked those emails about the East Anglia Climate Research Unit, blew the lid off that, and then it was the Chinese and their African allies, led by Sudan, who actually blocked the thing inside the conference.
[00:46:22.715 --> 00:46:24.896]  But now, let's see what the American people can do.
[00:46:25.536 --> 00:46:28.018]  I recommend a march on Goldman Sachs.
[00:46:28.339 --> 00:46:29.880]  Let's have a march on Wall Street.
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:33.063]  We've had these Tea Party people marching on Washington.
[00:46:33.844 --> 00:46:35.305]  You know, that's fine up to a point.
[00:46:35.665 --> 00:46:39.168]  But rather than going for the Cape, let's go for the Matador.
[00:46:39.408 --> 00:46:41.070]  And the Matador is in Wall Street.
[00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:45.213]  The power decisions in this case are all made by Wall Street.
[00:46:45.333 --> 00:46:47.055]  And then that is transmitted to the government.
[00:46:47.075 --> 00:46:48.376]  Hey, that's my analogy.
[00:46:49.497 --> 00:46:56.823]  We have, uh, Tim Geithner is known to have a cell phone, and he's got his speed dialing set up for two or three institutions.
[00:46:57.183 --> 00:47:01.286]  For Goldman Sachs, for Citibank, and JPMorgan Chase.
[00:47:01.326 --> 00:47:12.175]  So he wants to call Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan Chase, he wants to call Lloyd Blankfein at Goldman Sachs, and then, uh, Pandit the Bandit, Vikram Pandit at, uh, at Citibank.
[00:47:12.595 --> 00:47:20.819]  Those three, that's the state-sponsored compulsory cartel that features in the new Mussolini fascist corporate state.
[00:47:20.839 --> 00:47:25.561]  But again, it's that those companies own the government.
[00:47:25.581 --> 00:47:27.282]  They have taken over the U.S.
[00:47:27.322 --> 00:47:30.444]  Treasury in the person of Tiny Tim Geithner.
[00:47:30.744 --> 00:47:33.585]  Now, I think it's also, there's a big groundswell on this.
[00:47:33.886 --> 00:47:38.528]  The New York Post headline of today, Time for Tim to Go.
[00:47:39.474 --> 00:47:41.635]  This is a neocon newspaper, right?
[00:47:41.675 --> 00:47:42.296]  New York Post.
[00:47:42.936 --> 00:47:54.844]  There had been already rumors last week, when Chris Dodd quit the Senate, the word was already then, when, knowing that Geithner was in trouble, that Dodd would replace Geithner.
[00:47:54.884 --> 00:47:57.305]  Of course, that's not enough.
[00:47:57.345 --> 00:48:00.427]  That's just one Wall Street stooge replacing another.
[00:48:00.868 --> 00:48:04.470]  If you look at the Wall Street Journal of this morning, which I have in front of me,
[00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:06.251]  Here's what they're going with.
[00:48:06.331 --> 00:48:07.852]  It's a deception strategy.
[00:48:08.213 --> 00:48:12.776]  The headline in the Wall Street Journal is, Banks Brace for Bonus Fury.
[00:48:13.136 --> 00:48:23.864]  And they have a picture of Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, and how the public hates the bonuses, but the Goldman Sachs employees say that the bonuses are not enough, and they're not giving in cash.
[00:48:23.884 --> 00:48:24.965]  Yeah, that's not what it's about.
[00:48:25.005 --> 00:48:26.646]  It's about the crime that was committed.
[00:48:26.826 --> 00:48:46.502]  Yeah, the bonuses, I mean the bonuses of course are outrageous, and everybody can see that, but they amount to a billion or two at the most, whereas we're talking about $700 billion just in the scandal that's at the center of this, $220 billion as you say around that, and then it gets up to the $27 trillion or whatever it is.
[00:48:46.542 --> 00:48:54.589]  And then Obama will love that, he will use that to control the wages of people across the United States but not of the banks.
[00:48:55.387 --> 00:49:00.408]  Yes, so I think what we need, my recommendation is frankly class consciousness.
[00:49:00.468 --> 00:49:03.929]  In other words, we have the people and we have the bankers.
[00:49:04.369 --> 00:49:05.409]  The people are one thing.
[00:49:05.449 --> 00:49:08.589]  The people basically the middle class and people who'd like to be part of it.
[00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:11.210]  The bankers are a finance oligarchy.
[00:49:11.570 --> 00:49:14.031]  They're globalized elitists.
[00:49:14.091 --> 00:49:15.051]  They have no country.
[00:49:15.451 --> 00:49:20.132]  They go from Barclays to Deutsche Bank to UBS in Switzerland.
[00:49:20.492 --> 00:49:21.672]  They don't care about this stuff.
[00:49:22.032 --> 00:49:25.035]  So you've got to understand what essentially is the enemy.
[00:49:25.095 --> 00:49:28.197]  The enemy is the financier elite.
[00:49:28.357 --> 00:49:29.518]  The banks, in other words.
[00:49:29.678 --> 00:49:30.739]  They've got to fight the banks.
[00:49:30.759 --> 00:49:33.562]  Yeah, they are the source of everything.
[00:49:33.622 --> 00:49:36.924]  They're the source of the land grabbing, the police state, the wars.
[00:49:37.605 --> 00:49:40.727]  We're going to come back in two segments, this segment and one other.
[00:49:40.747 --> 00:49:48.452]  Then we have another guest joining us, Wayne Madsen, with some big breaking news and take phone calls from Dave, John, Joe, Sector, Mark and others.
[00:49:49.272 --> 00:49:55.836]  But Webster, so much is going on, but clearly people are finally realizing the real economy is falling apart.
[00:49:56.917 --> 00:49:59.918]  This song and dance about the economy being better is a fraud.
[00:50:01.319 --> 00:50:07.582]  And the people are waking up to the criminality, but we can't just let them scapegoat Geithner.
[00:50:07.622 --> 00:50:23.728]  We've got to go after the whole system, have the Congress audit, abolish the Fed, have the Congress under the Constitution in its role, take over the issuance of currency and credit, turn it loose as an engine of production and power for this society.
[00:50:24.088 --> 00:50:27.410]  And if we educate people about the bankers and the scams they engage in,
[00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:29.993]  And put the controls in there to stop this.
[00:50:30.454 --> 00:50:31.876]  We can see a new golden age.
[00:50:31.936 --> 00:50:34.800]  If we don't, the globalists have de-industrialized us.
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:36.022]  They've moved everything to China.
[00:50:36.422 --> 00:50:38.726]  They're in the final phases of their operation.
[00:50:39.206 --> 00:50:40.208]  It's getting painful.
[00:50:40.588 --> 00:50:43.452]  So people are finally paying attention to who the real enemy is.
[00:50:44.093 --> 00:50:47.677]  Either these scam artist bankers go down or we go down.
[00:50:47.797 --> 00:50:53.483]  It's us or them and that's what followed the Republic and Obama deception exposed.
[00:50:53.763 --> 00:50:58.869]  That's why it's important all of you get it on DVD at InfoWars.com and give it to everyone you know.
[00:50:58.949 --> 00:51:00.050]  People are ready to be woken up.
[00:51:00.993 --> 00:51:03.295]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[00:51:03.435 --> 00:51:05.157]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[00:51:05.317 --> 00:51:07.098]  NoMoreMortgage can change your life.
[00:51:07.179 --> 00:51:08.520]  We paid off all of our bills.

[00:51:17.047 --> 00:51:18.629]  Even have more money left over each month?
[00:51:18.729 --> 00:51:21.311]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[00:51:21.391 --> 00:51:21.792]  NoMoreMortgage.
[00:51:23.813 --> 00:51:25.053]  Where have they been all of our life?
[00:51:25.093 --> 00:51:27.534]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.
[00:51:27.614 --> 00:51:31.235]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.
[00:51:31.495 --> 00:51:33.616]  I'm Larry Ruff, president of No More Mortgage.

[00:51:45.079 --> 00:51:47.259]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:51:47.319 --> 00:51:48.579]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:52:11.545 --> 00:52:14.208]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.228 --> 00:52:20.454]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.614 --> 00:52:26.139]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:26.159 --> 00:52:35.788]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:35.888 --> 00:52:38.010]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:39.571]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.831 --> 00:52:42.113]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.294 --> 00:52:44.135]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.435 --> 00:52:49.180]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:54.364]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[00:54:09.699 --> 00:54:10.960]  There's so many facets of this.
[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:13.241]  So many crimes.
[00:54:34.761 --> 00:54:45.724]  Grabbing big private banks that were solvent, stealing them, giving themselves hundreds of billions of dollars in goodies, lying about it, saying we won't tell you where the money is.
[00:54:45.744 --> 00:54:52.126]  I mean, if they get away with this and the naked body scanners and all these other acts of submission, what comes next?
[00:54:52.146 --> 00:54:56.287]  Will they demand our firstborn be sacrificed to them, like other governments have done in history?
[00:54:56.808 --> 00:54:57.768]  I mean, where does it end?
[00:54:58.922 --> 00:55:00.303]  Let's talk to Dave in California.
[00:55:00.323 --> 00:55:02.044]  You're on the air with Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[00:55:02.064 --> 00:55:07.247]  By the way, we carry all three of his books at InfoWars.com, including Cataclysm.
[00:55:07.267 --> 00:55:10.249]  If you really want to understand what's happening with the banking scam, that's the book.
[00:55:10.609 --> 00:55:12.110]  Dave, you're on the air with Webster Tarpley.
[00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:12.530]  Go ahead.
[00:55:13.031 --> 00:55:13.451]  Hello.
[00:55:13.511 --> 00:55:15.352]  Yeah, thanks for taking my call.
[00:55:15.712 --> 00:55:17.333]  I've got three quick things to mention.
[00:55:17.654 --> 00:55:18.354]  One is a statement.
[00:55:18.454 --> 00:55:19.795]  One is a question.
[00:55:19.815 --> 00:55:20.715]  The other one is a suggestion.
[00:55:20.796 --> 00:55:22.597]  I'm going to have to let you go in just a sec, though.
[00:55:22.637 --> 00:55:22.897]  Go ahead.
[00:55:23.692 --> 00:55:31.699]  Okay, yeah, first off, I love Webster Tarpley, and I saw him recently in a European movie called Zero, an investigation into 9-11.
[00:55:32.179 --> 00:55:39.104]  And I've heard very little about this movie Zero, and I was wondering if, like, you guys could possibly, you know, help promote it or post it on InfoWars.
[00:55:39.144 --> 00:55:39.545]  Sure, great.
[00:55:39.565 --> 00:55:40.506]  I appreciate your call.
[00:55:40.546 --> 00:55:41.206]  Take care, Dave.
[00:55:41.506 --> 00:55:45.249]  You know, I told you we're taking calls for Webster Tarpley!
[00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:47.231]  I mean, come on!
[00:55:47.711 --> 00:55:50.033]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[00:55:50.333 --> 00:55:51.775]  Let's talk to John in Florida.
[00:55:51.835 --> 00:55:52.715]  John, you're on the air.
[00:55:52.755 --> 00:55:53.176]  Go ahead.
[00:55:54.526 --> 00:55:58.029]  Thank you for taking my call, Mr. Tarpley.
[00:55:59.690 --> 00:56:02.492]  My question has to do with auditing the Fed.
[00:56:02.512 --> 00:56:16.163]  It seems obvious that the only way to break the credibility of the current administration and all these people that are controlling the world is to successfully get a passage of the H.R.
[00:56:16.183 --> 00:56:20.786]  1207 to uncover all these intricate relationships.
[00:56:20.826 --> 00:56:21.487]  Would you agree?
[00:56:21.527 --> 00:56:23.108]  And if so, what's it going to take?
[00:56:24.062 --> 00:56:26.085]  Well, I would agree, but that's only the first step.
[00:56:26.145 --> 00:56:30.551]  I mean, right now, what we've got on the table could take us one step beyond an audit.
[00:56:30.591 --> 00:56:38.621]  That is a special prosecutor that would go after Bernanke, and let me mention another guy, Donald Cohn, K-O-H-N.
[00:56:39.242 --> 00:56:49.829]  In hearings just about a year ago, January 13, 2009, Congressman Grayson, you know him, he's a loudmouth Democrat from Florida, I think, but doing a good thing here.
[00:56:50.209 --> 00:56:57.074]  Grayson demanded to know from Donald Cohen of the Fed, what are the names of the people who got that AIG money, and how much did they get?
[00:56:57.134 --> 00:56:57.914]  Will you reveal it?
[00:56:57.974 --> 00:56:59.115]  And Cohen said no.
[00:56:59.555 --> 00:57:00.896]  So let's put Cohen on the list.
[00:57:01.216 --> 00:57:04.919]  If you could get a special prosecutor going around inside the Fed,
[00:57:05.359 --> 00:57:08.764]  That would allow you to do it maybe from another angle.
[00:57:09.064 --> 00:57:11.327]  I'm all for auditing the Fed, but here's the thing.
[00:57:11.707 --> 00:57:13.369]  The Fed has got to be seized.
[00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:15.532]  In other words, take it out of the control of that.
[00:57:15.572 --> 00:57:17.114]  Yeah, it's unconstitutional.
[00:57:17.154 --> 00:57:18.977]  Put it under the Congress and the President.
[00:57:19.317 --> 00:57:20.959]  Yes, we have to put it under the Congress.
[00:57:20.979 --> 00:57:22.061]  That's in the Constitution.
[00:57:22.601 --> 00:57:23.342]  And it's simple.
[00:57:23.722 --> 00:57:25.904]  Expose the bankers as the criminals.
[00:57:25.964 --> 00:57:39.775]  Expose their fraud politically, instead of it being Obama or Palin and this left-right diversion, where we then get Palin or Mitt Romney or Petraeus for four years, and then people get mad and throw them out.
[00:57:40.235 --> 00:57:42.377]  And we got to think about false flag too, Webster.
[00:57:42.817 --> 00:57:48.742]  You've been saying all last year, and look at it now, clearly the underwear bomber is the kickoff for new false flag.
[00:57:48.782 --> 00:57:49.723]  They want new wars.
[00:57:50.458 --> 00:57:52.800]  Well, we also had this very interesting thing last Monday.
[00:57:52.860 --> 00:58:04.027]  Richard Wolff went on the Olbermann Show and said that the Obama White House was convinced that the Christmas patsy from Nigeria, that that was an intentional action for various reasons.
[00:58:04.068 --> 00:58:10.892]  So it means that, really, the rogue network and their false flag operations are very, very close to the surface right now.
[00:58:10.992 --> 00:58:14.895]  Obama, of course, punted, Obama turned away, didn't do anything.
[00:58:15.215 --> 00:58:18.878]  Obama needs to start firing some people and maybe he could fire some moles.
[00:58:19.238 --> 00:58:20.739]  But here's another thing to demand.
[00:58:21.039 --> 00:58:23.842]  John, your point about auditing the Fed being key.
[00:58:24.282 --> 00:58:25.663]  You audit it.
[00:58:25.943 --> 00:58:27.404]  The Treasury needs to be audited.
[00:58:27.605 --> 00:58:28.886]  All this needs to be public.
[00:58:29.126 --> 00:58:34.070]  You've got private banks openly robbing everyone.
[00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:35.070]  When is it going to end?
[00:58:35.491 --> 00:58:37.492]  Final call straight ahead for Webster Tarpley.
[00:58:38.073 --> 00:58:40.174]  Then Wayne Madsen with breaking news.
[00:58:42.516 --> 00:58:46.179]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.199 --> 00:58:47.961]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:51.983 --> 00:58:55.664]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:58:56.004 --> 00:58:59.005]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:58:59.245 --> 00:59:04.026]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:59:04.046 --> 00:59:10.288]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:10.448 --> 00:59:12.669]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:13.209 --> 00:59:14.630]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:15.950]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:18.211]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:32.116 --> 00:59:33.957]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:34.257 --> 00:59:39.040]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:49.345]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:53.788 --> 00:59:55.709]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.189 --> 00:59:58.971]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:13.168]  Wayne Madsen coming up with breaking news on multiple fronts.
[01:00:13.971 --> 01:00:15.435]  Going to phone calls right now.
[01:00:15.515 --> 01:00:17.139]  Joe Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:00:17.199 --> 01:00:17.560]  Welcome.
[01:00:20.038 --> 01:00:21.139]  Thank you both for having me.
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.461]  It inspired me to take some action today.
[01:00:23.481 --> 01:00:34.011]  I just want to tell you what I did to take action concerning this Geithner situation, tell you about the roadblocks I hit, and then maybe each of you could maybe help me perfect my technique when I make these kind of calls.
[01:00:34.351 --> 01:00:34.771]  Go ahead.
[01:00:35.612 --> 01:00:41.017]  I called two network affiliates here in Columbus this morning to ask why there was zero coverage on the Geithner story.
[01:00:41.713 --> 01:00:43.494]  Either on the air or on their websites.
[01:00:43.954 --> 01:00:46.575]  Neither phone operator even knew who Geithner was.
[01:00:46.615 --> 01:00:50.737]  I had to explain to each news desk operator who Timothy Geithner was.
[01:00:52.278 --> 01:00:53.838]  So they gave me the cursor, you sure?
[01:00:54.119 --> 01:00:54.959]  We'll take care of it.
[01:00:55.599 --> 01:00:56.400]  Thanks for your call.
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:58.701]  I emailed the CBS affiliate.
[01:00:58.741 --> 01:01:01.722]  They sent back a form email saying they'd already covered it once.
[01:01:02.452 --> 01:01:09.835]  I called Senators Brown and Voinovich, spoke with both of their interns, asked if either had released a statement on Geithner.
[01:01:10.116 --> 01:01:16.558]  Neither had, so I suggested that maybe they would publicly want to distance themselves from such scum and call for an indictment.
[01:01:16.598 --> 01:01:17.779]  What you're doing is beautiful.
[01:01:17.839 --> 01:01:25.182]  Call into Talk Radio, send articles that we write at PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com that boils this down.
[01:01:25.642 --> 01:01:26.203]  Send this.
[01:01:26.963 --> 01:01:30.927]  I would say, in particular, that Sherrod Brown, right?
[01:01:31.147 --> 01:01:38.633]  Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio makes a big thing about being an economic populist and a pro-union guy for the working man in the blue-collar America.
[01:01:52.745 --> 01:01:56.066]  Keep the heat on Sherrod Brown, because this is where you can really squeeze him.
[01:01:56.366 --> 01:02:00.808]  How come he's covering up for Geithner and the New York Fed and these financial parasites?
[01:02:01.528 --> 01:02:03.929]  Yeah, but I think what Joe's doing is excellent.
[01:02:03.989 --> 01:02:04.469]  Keep it up, Joe.
[01:02:04.489 --> 01:02:04.749]  Absolutely.
[01:02:04.989 --> 01:02:05.429]  Keep it up.
[01:02:05.509 --> 01:02:07.410]  No, but don't give up on Sherrod Brown.
[01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:09.811]  Voinovich is harder to get because he's on his way out.
[01:02:09.831 --> 01:02:10.431]  All right.
[01:02:10.471 --> 01:02:11.131]  Thank you, Joe.
[01:02:11.171 --> 01:02:12.071]  Got to jump.
[01:02:13.112 --> 01:02:15.312]  Shekhtar, I believe, in India.
[01:02:15.332 --> 01:02:16.513]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:17.933]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:17.953 --> 01:02:19.814]  Mr. Jones, Mr. Tarpley, great to talk to you.
[01:02:20.831 --> 01:02:22.332]  I've got a few suggestions.
[01:02:22.352 --> 01:02:23.473]  I think Mr. Tarpley is right.
[01:02:23.513 --> 01:02:27.736]  I think we should all contact Mr. Grayson and have him pursue this further.
[01:02:28.216 --> 01:02:35.101]  And maybe is there any chance we can get these 18 Attorney Generals that were interested in the healthcare sham to maybe go after this also.
[01:02:35.221 --> 01:02:41.246]  And then also, maybe if you could get Vincent Bugliosi on, maybe he would have some suggestions to take these criminals down.
[01:02:41.806 --> 01:02:44.668]  And I started out with a Providian credit card.
[01:02:44.708 --> 01:02:48.331]  It went to Washington Mutual, and now it's at Chase, and they're charging me 29.9% interest.
[01:02:50.262 --> 01:02:51.742]  I'm trying to get out of it as soon as I can.
[01:02:51.782 --> 01:02:54.363]  We need to arrest these criminals and take them down.
[01:02:54.383 --> 01:02:55.964]  I thank you and appreciate all that y'all do.
[01:03:16.502 --> 01:03:30.971]  Yeah, they clearly have intimidated and destroyed people to send a message to everybody to not stand up, but as the pain gets more and more intense, as the abuse and crime becomes more and more transparent, they're not going to be able to shut everybody up.
[01:03:31.491 --> 01:03:33.232]  The positive sign is...
[01:03:34.213 --> 01:03:49.204]  Most of these bankers are buying homes in non-extradition countries around the world and clearly have been moving the last two years into a fully offshore profile with the belief that they may lose total control.
[01:03:49.224 --> 01:03:50.245]  In fact, here's Bloomberg.
[01:03:51.045 --> 01:04:01.453]  Arming Goldman Sachs with pistols and it says they're preparing to defend themselves from riots and from mobs and preparing to basically evacuate the country.
[01:04:01.733 --> 01:04:08.839]  So that shows they're scared, they realize they're criminals and they're now getting the getaway car all warmed up and provisioned.
[01:04:09.574 --> 01:04:21.446]  Well, there was already a march on Goldman Sachs a couple of months ago by a bakery, the Stelladoro Bakery Workers, who were getting fired because they'd been asset stripped and looted by Goldman Sachs.
[01:04:21.486 --> 01:04:25.089]  And again, I recommend, we've had enough marches on Washington for a while.
[01:04:25.409 --> 01:04:28.012]  Let's have a march on Wall Street specifically called Goldman Sachs.
[01:04:28.732 --> 01:04:29.533]  I agree.
[01:04:29.573 --> 01:04:33.174]  We'll get We Are Change and Luke Rodowski, he's in that sector.
[01:04:33.594 --> 01:04:38.776]  We need everybody to set that up and go down there and let them know that we know they're the problem.
[01:04:39.237 --> 01:04:44.259]  And see if the police even allow free speech, because they love the bankers so much they're destroying their entire future.
[01:04:44.639 --> 01:04:48.780]  Webster, we're going to keep pushing for criminal indictments and a special prosecutor.
[01:04:49.321 --> 01:04:51.962]  All your great books are available at InfoWars.com.
[01:04:52.042 --> 01:04:52.762]  God bless you.
[01:04:53.102 --> 01:04:54.583]  Thanks for spending time with us, Webster.
[01:04:55.094 --> 01:04:55.495]  Happy New Year.
[01:04:55.515 --> 01:04:57.141]  Yeah, Happy New Year, my friend.
[01:04:57.161 --> 01:04:59.188]  Alright, I got another guest coming up.
[01:04:59.449 --> 01:04:59.970]  Wayne Madsen.
[01:05:01.328 --> 01:05:03.930]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:05:04.330 --> 01:05:09.294]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:05:09.655 --> 01:05:11.396]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:05:11.716 --> 01:05:16.540]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:17.681]  How much do you want?
[01:05:17.901 --> 01:05:18.642]  When do you want it?
[01:05:19.022 --> 01:05:20.624]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:05:20.904 --> 01:05:21.744]  When will you need it?
[01:05:21.985 --> 01:05:24.046]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:05:24.186 --> 01:05:25.287]  Will there be any food?
[01:05:25.527 --> 01:05:26.869]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:27.409]  If there's a
[01:05:27.449 --> 01:05:29.431]  Quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:05:29.572 --> 01:05:32.115]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:05:32.295 --> 01:05:35.499]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:05:35.899 --> 01:05:39.384]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:05:39.704 --> 01:05:40.705]  How much will you need?
[01:05:40.945 --> 01:05:41.546]  We don't know.
[01:05:41.847 --> 01:05:42.768]  How much do you want?
[01:05:42.948 --> 01:05:43.689]  All you can get.
[01:05:43.869 --> 01:05:44.270]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:47.713]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:05:48.013 --> 01:05:55.300]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:59.423]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:06:02.346 --> 01:06:06.029]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:06.370 --> 01:06:09.392]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:06:09.613 --> 01:06:11.014]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:06:11.733 --> 01:06:14.375]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:06:14.396 --> 01:06:20.601]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:06:20.781 --> 01:06:25.826]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:06:25.986 --> 01:06:29.129]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:06:29.149 --> 01:06:35.975]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:06:36.075 --> 01:06:38.176]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:06:38.416 --> 01:06:39.757]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:06:40.017 --> 01:06:42.299]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:06:42.479 --> 01:06:44.300]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:49.363]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:06:49.743 --> 01:06:58.848]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:07:00.854 --> 01:07:04.136]  America is in deep, deep trouble because we don't know our rights.
[01:07:04.456 --> 01:07:10.678]  Let's get real freedom back into America by teaching and promoting the Bill of Rights with the 2010 Freedom Calendar.
[01:07:10.898 --> 01:07:11.159]  Why?
[01:07:11.379 --> 01:07:13.239]  Because our forefathers gave them to us.
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:16.441]  Because the Freedom Calendar is true patriotism in action.
[01:07:16.701 --> 01:07:20.926]  And because if you don't know your rights and use them, you may lose them.
[01:07:21.146 --> 01:07:24.569]  The Freedom Calendar is the best educational tool in over 200 years.
[01:07:24.810 --> 01:07:30.396]  It shows in detail how to use your rights, how to answer any bureaucrat, how to use your guaranteed rights for true freedom.
[01:07:30.556 --> 01:07:36.362]  The Freedom Calendar is the easy way to learn the proper use and function of each of our rights, and is perfect for homeschoolers.
[01:07:36.562 --> 01:07:36.922]  I think so.
[01:08:01.654 --> 01:08:07.301]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.065 --> 01:08:17.554]  Waging war on corruption, crashing to the lies and disinformation, Monday through Friday, 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[01:08:17.674 --> 01:08:18.074]  Eastern.
[01:08:18.154 --> 01:08:20.718]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:08:22.346 --> 01:08:25.088]  For the rest of the hour, Wayne Madsen is with us.
[01:08:25.108 --> 01:08:28.751]  He, of course, has written for some of the biggest publications in the country.
[01:08:29.452 --> 01:08:38.299]  He is an author, researcher, worked with the National Security Agency and other secretive federal bodies in national security.
[01:08:38.999 --> 01:08:44.702]  And he's been breaking important news after important news up there on Capitol Hill and at the Press Club every day.
[01:08:44.842 --> 01:08:47.924]  But I wanted to get him on about Bankstergate.
[01:08:48.004 --> 01:08:52.606]  I don't want to just have it be Timmygate, Geithnergate, because it's much bigger than just him.
[01:08:52.626 --> 01:09:07.935]  And how the White House has been caught now clearly lying, saying Geithner wasn't involved in any of this, when he headed the New York Fed that set the policy and gave the orders, and now the Treasury, marking these toxic derivatives at 100% being paid directly to him and others.
[01:09:08.875 --> 01:09:14.961]  Also, I want to get into a bunch of other big news that Wayne Madsen's been working on.
[01:09:15.802 --> 01:09:25.732]  Also, what's going on with Obama, trying to block his records, gag orders going on, the way they compromise congressmen, and other big stories he's working on.
[01:09:25.752 --> 01:09:30.156]  He's always breaking important news that weeks, months, and years later comes out in the mainstream.
[01:09:30.557 --> 01:09:32.719]  Wayne Madsen of WayneMadsenReport.com.
[01:09:32.739 --> 01:09:33.520]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:09:37.318 --> 01:09:38.881]  Again, good to have you here with us, Wayne.
[01:09:39.402 --> 01:09:41.727]  Let's get into BanksterGate first.
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:48.682]  Well, now we have several bankers talking about giving themselves big bonuses.
[01:09:49.162 --> 01:10:00.965]  Lloyd Blankfein from Goldman Sachs may get the biggest bonus among many of the others of these bailout banks, and people are just outraged by it all.
[01:10:01.025 --> 01:10:07.327]  Now we're hearing that the next target may be our 401ks and our IRAs.
[01:10:08.287 --> 01:10:12.308]  The government may want to roll those over into annuities, which is yet another
[01:10:18.252 --> 01:10:28.680]  And in the banking overhaul that gave them more power of a month ago, they state that your money markets or your basic savings funds, they may seize those.
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:30.301]  Those aren't insured.
[01:10:30.581 --> 01:10:35.705]  And yes, they're going to start taking a percentage of and grabbing your 401Ks.
[01:10:35.765 --> 01:10:38.247]  I mean, they are just getting started in the stealing.
[01:10:39.082 --> 01:10:43.923]  Well, and I wonder, you know, where are the American people, where are they going to draw the line?
[01:10:44.043 --> 01:10:48.924]  I mean, this is like a constantly moving goalpost.
[01:10:49.364 --> 01:10:54.545]  Where is the goalpost of absolute outrage where there's no going back?
[01:10:54.645 --> 01:11:02.067]  And I don't know what it's going to take to wake people up, but perhaps maybe if they see their money disappear, maybe that'll do it.
[01:11:02.127 --> 01:11:05.508]  But, you know, I'm not holding out any hopes because
[01:11:06.048 --> 01:11:06.648]  We're good to go.
[01:11:24.278 --> 01:11:40.671]  People like former Illinois Governor Blagojevich and former Alabama Governor Siegelman complaining about Obama basically being in the hip pockets of the corporations, that he's really a fake and a phony and a fraud.
[01:11:41.211 --> 01:11:49.198]  We see former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer saying that this woman, the Democrats, are running for re-election as Senator.
[01:11:49.998 --> 01:11:50.319]  We're good.
[01:12:05.117 --> 01:12:12.304]  Who's talking about what Obama and Rahm Emanuel and Bernanke and the rest of these crooks are doing.
[01:12:12.965 --> 01:12:15.848]  Their phone calls are being intercepted on a daily basis.
[01:12:16.429 --> 01:12:28.221]  And these phone calls are being turned over to willing prosecutors because they—look, they can piece together any phone call, including ours right now, and charge us with some sort of a crime.
[01:12:29.258 --> 01:12:49.687]  Well, going back specifically to BanksterGate with Geithner, I mean, he's always told Congress, as the head of the New York Fed setting policy for the entire system and then as Treasury Secretary, that he won't tell people where the money went, and that's when the policy of the former Treasury Secretary, the former Fed Chief, the current Fed Chief, they're all on record.
[01:12:49.707 --> 01:12:54.729]  I played clips a few hours ago of him saying, I won't tell you where the money is, to now have Geithner say,
[01:12:55.649 --> 01:13:07.039]  Okay, you got emails from the New York Federal Reserve telling AIG to not say where millions of dollars of money was going to Goldman Sachs' bonuses and ordering them to lie and keep it off the forms.
[01:13:07.399 --> 01:13:09.922]  Now he's saying he wasn't involved in that decision.
[01:13:09.942 --> 01:13:13.224]  I mean, we clearly have him in congressional perjury now.
[01:13:13.605 --> 01:13:15.567]  We clearly have the White House lying.
[01:13:15.987 --> 01:13:17.228]  This is bipartisan.
[01:13:18.129 --> 01:13:19.230]  They own both parties.
[01:13:19.390 --> 01:13:20.291]  I mean, where does it go?
[01:13:21.081 --> 01:13:26.765]  Well, I think, you know, what are we seeing from Congress as far as oversight?
[01:13:26.785 --> 01:13:28.146]  We're seeing very, very little.
[01:13:28.806 --> 01:13:33.950]  I think many members, we have a lot of members now deciding not to run for re-election.
[01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:39.654]  My sources are telling me people like Byron Dorgan, who basically complained about the shipment of U.S.
[01:13:39.714 --> 01:13:41.255]  jobs overseas.
[01:13:41.275 --> 01:13:43.577]  He wrote a book called Take This Job and Ship It.
[01:13:44.317 --> 01:13:47.880]  And he said in 99, don't get rid of Glass-Steagall.
[01:13:48.675 --> 01:13:50.536]  Right, and now he's set up.
[01:13:51.096 --> 01:13:59.839]  He's been pressured by the Rahm Emanuels, and I think he's just thrown his hands up and saying, look, folks, this is too much.
[01:13:59.899 --> 01:14:04.180]  Chris Dodd, of course, is in over his head with a lot of this, and he knows it.
[01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:05.801]  And he knows that he won't be
[01:14:06.001 --> 01:14:23.349]  Remember last year how the White House said they knew nothing about bonuses when they pressured to have Dodd write the bill where they could retroactively still get bonuses and were exempt from the new regulations on CEO and executive bonuses and then Dodd released the email where the White House told him to do it?
[01:14:23.931 --> 01:14:28.795]  Absolutely, and I think that's another reason that Dodd is leaving the Senate as well.
[01:14:29.256 --> 01:14:34.560]  He got used by these people, and he knows that his career is basically over with.
[01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:45.349]  Now we hate to see the hullabaloo about Harry Reid, saying that, you know, Obama is some sort of a, really, you know, he's the kind of guy that can be all things to all people.
[01:14:45.389 --> 01:14:46.370]  I think he's basically
[01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:46.810]  I think so.
[01:15:02.715 --> 01:15:07.099]  And the other bank, Wall Street Bankers, I have to say McCain did too.
[01:15:07.159 --> 01:15:10.002]  I mean, both parties are run by the same conglomerate.
[01:15:10.182 --> 01:15:11.203]  And so what do we do?
[01:15:11.243 --> 01:15:13.445]  I mean, clearly Obama's out in three years.
[01:15:14.166 --> 01:15:17.469]  But then the Republicans are just as deep into all of this.
[01:15:17.849 --> 01:15:24.255]  The public's starting to figure out that this is a bipartisan heist going on.
[01:15:24.275 --> 01:15:28.699]  And I guess they're just going to rely on surveillance, riot police, and Northcom.
[01:15:29.639 --> 01:15:40.386]  Well, I think what we, again, I think what we're going to see in 2012 is one of those rare opportunities where a true independent candidate for president, was it good?
[01:15:41.327 --> 01:15:49.872]  He or she has to have an immense campaign, staff of volunteers, and it could happen.
[01:15:49.932 --> 01:15:51.213]  It happened almost in 1992 with Perot.
[01:15:52.794 --> 01:15:59.421]  If it was going to be Ron Paul, he'd have to declare now and start building the grassroots base, but some people say that he's too old.
[01:15:59.761 --> 01:16:01.323]  I mean, who else is there out there?
[01:16:01.723 --> 01:16:05.107]  Well, I think certainly Jesse Ventura is getting a lot of exposure now.
[01:16:05.127 --> 01:16:06.188]  I've talked to him privately.
[01:16:06.929 --> 01:16:08.611]  He is not going to run.
[01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:12.370]  Well, you know, we always heard that from other candidates, too.
[01:16:12.450 --> 01:16:16.991]  And, you know, I remember Perot used to say the same thing on Larry King's show.
[01:16:17.051 --> 01:16:25.873]  And he said, but Larry, if the people want me to run and call this 800 number, and he got enough money, of course, he decided to get in.
[01:16:25.893 --> 01:16:29.694]  You know, politicians, of course, like to say that.
[01:16:29.714 --> 01:16:30.835]  They don't want to show their cards.
[01:16:30.915 --> 01:16:32.455]  It's really like a game of poker.
[01:16:33.215 --> 01:16:34.756]  But sooner than later, people
[01:16:44.183 --> 01:16:46.826]  Well, we'll see what happens on that front.
[01:16:47.026 --> 01:16:48.668]  What do you think about Congressman Issa?
[01:16:49.068 --> 01:16:54.153]  He obviously doesn't have any skeletons in his closet going after the Fed, or they would have already trotted them out.
[01:16:54.573 --> 01:16:55.915]  Grayson's got a lot of courage.
[01:16:56.395 --> 01:16:57.596]  Paul's got a lot of courage.
[01:17:00.759 --> 01:17:04.361]  The Independent from Connecticut has got a lot of courage.
[01:17:05.142 --> 01:17:06.563]  We see some others with courage.
[01:17:07.183 --> 01:17:10.506]  I mean, this is the elephant in the room, though.
[01:17:11.046 --> 01:17:12.667]  How long can this go on?
[01:17:12.687 --> 01:17:19.452]  I mean, I have reports here where Goldman Sachs is arming themselves with weapons against the public and buying homes offshore.
[01:17:19.792 --> 01:17:21.213]  They clearly know what they've done.
[01:17:21.233 --> 01:17:23.915]  I mean, what's the inside scoop in D.C.
[01:17:23.955 --> 01:17:25.436]  you're getting on how far this is going to go?
[01:17:26.078 --> 01:17:30.440]  Well, I think you meant to say the independent Bernie Sanders from Vermont.
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:30.940]  Vermont, excuse me?
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:35.821]  The independent from Connecticut, of course, is the horrible and despicable Joe Lieberman.
[01:17:35.841 --> 01:17:37.182]  Yeah, I meant Connecticut.
[01:17:37.222 --> 01:17:38.402]  I meant Bernie Sanders.
[01:17:39.343 --> 01:17:41.684]  I know you did.
[01:17:41.724 --> 01:17:47.706]  People like Lieberman, let's face it, I mean, these are the types of people that are irritating the constituents out there.
[01:17:48.826 --> 01:17:52.887]  But I think where this is going, this is an election year.
[01:17:52.927 --> 01:17:54.188]  We're seeing a lot of incumbents.
[01:17:54.628 --> 01:17:56.249]  We're good to go.
[01:18:15.157 --> 01:18:20.979]  But that's my next issue, is Democrats at the state and federal level are flip-flopping to Republicans.
[01:18:21.459 --> 01:18:22.939]  They're leaving en masse.
[01:18:23.359 --> 01:18:35.363]  They know this health care tax, this scam, this bailout to insurance companies is unpopular with Democrats and Republicans, but they're so bought and paid for, they're so blackmailed, they're still going ahead with it.
[01:18:36.095 --> 01:18:41.679]  Yeah, and you know, there's a lot of, you don't see a lot of the party switching that you used to.
[01:18:41.739 --> 01:18:47.142]  I think people are just basically, the elected people in office are saying to heck with both these parties.
[01:18:47.623 --> 01:18:55.268]  It does no good to go from Democrat to Republican or Republican to Democrat because both parties are absolutely corrupt right now.
[01:18:56.429 --> 01:18:58.290]  You know, is a third party viable?
[01:18:58.310 --> 01:19:00.171]  Well, we've been through all the third parties.
[01:19:01.052 --> 01:19:05.495]  My criticism of third parties is they're a lot like a parlor game.
[01:19:06.015 --> 01:19:09.538]  That's why I think criminal indictments are the way to go.
[01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:13.241]  We need to have state grand juries, special prosecutors at the federal level.
[01:19:13.301 --> 01:19:16.023]  We need to see Geithner and the rest of these guys arrested.
[01:19:16.103 --> 01:19:17.424]  End it that way.
[01:19:31.729 --> 01:19:34.391]  Yeah.
[01:19:34.651 --> 01:19:49.201]  Yeah, that's why we've gotten to this point, because the systemic corruption, like a cesspool, has gotten so thick and so deep that we're collapsing like Mexico.
[01:19:50.102 --> 01:19:50.502]  Stay there.
[01:19:50.542 --> 01:19:54.905]  I want to get into a bunch of other news and issues with Wayne Madsen, our guest, and phone calls later.
[01:19:54.925 --> 01:20:00.529]  There's a lot of hot issues, important issues Wayne's going to be covering on the other side of this break.
[01:20:00.549 --> 01:20:00.929]  Stay with us.
[01:20:01.649 --> 01:20:02.890]  This is an emergency alert.
[01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:05.471]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[01:20:05.832 --> 01:20:08.833]  They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[01:20:09.373 --> 01:20:13.616]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyperstimulation.
[01:20:14.156 --> 01:20:19.319]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body, adding to your death risk.
[01:20:19.899 --> 01:20:24.141]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations, and drug toxicity.
[01:20:24.401 --> 01:20:30.424]  Call this number to get my free special report about the flu and what to do to save lives, maybe even your own.
[01:20:30.844 --> 01:20:32.105]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz.
[01:20:32.485 --> 01:20:35.887]  Order Zeolife, the world's most powerful broad-spectrum detoxifier.
[01:20:36.287 --> 01:20:37.008]  We're good to go!
[01:21:02.014 --> 01:21:05.679]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:09.044]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:09.285 --> 01:21:10.707]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:21:11.405 --> 01:21:14.066]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:21:14.086 --> 01:21:20.309]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:25.512]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:21:25.652 --> 01:21:35.637]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:21:35.757 --> 01:21:37.878]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:21:38.119 --> 01:21:39.439]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:41.981]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:42.161 --> 01:21:44.002]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:21:44.282 --> 01:21:49.105]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:23:01.181 --> 01:23:03.785]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:23:04.206 --> 01:23:09.174]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:23:09.534 --> 01:23:11.277]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:23:11.578 --> 01:23:16.305]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:23:17.773 --> 01:23:18.193]  We're good to go.
[01:23:34.309 --> 01:23:34.549]  I think so.
[01:24:04.830 --> 01:24:13.112]  Okay, we're going to cover Blackwater, Obama's records with the CIA, clearly black ops.
[01:24:13.152 --> 01:24:17.833]  We're going to get into blackmail, Stellar Wind.
[01:24:17.873 --> 01:24:18.873]  It's come out that
[01:24:33.644 --> 01:24:33.824]  I don't
[01:24:48.644 --> 01:24:54.066]  In Afghanistan, with a triple agent, they said, and a lot more with Wayne Madsen.
[01:24:54.126 --> 01:25:01.410]  And your calls the last 15 minutes or so, for those that are holding, I'm really, again, honored to always have Wayne Madsen and waynemadsenreport.com on with us.
[01:25:01.550 --> 01:25:04.971]  Our websites, of course, are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:25:05.271 --> 01:25:13.355]  Okay, Wayne, of those four things I mentioned, false flag, blackmail, Obama's records, Blackwater, which one do you want to take first?
[01:25:13.831 --> 01:25:27.239]  Well, let's talk about the blackmail and the fact that the National Security Agency program, which was once codenamed Stellar Wind, that was a very highly kept codeword during the Bush administration.
[01:25:27.659 --> 01:25:39.846]  We knew about it because of some leaks that came out of the Justice Department, fortunately from people that knew it was illegal, but since the compromise of Stellar Wind, the codenames changed.
[01:25:39.926 --> 01:25:41.267]  I would love to get the new one, but
[01:25:41.727 --> 01:25:58.246]  You know, people at the National Security Agency and other intelligence agencies are basically running scared because they've got their own internal Gestapo security people trying to find out, of course, who's leaking anything to the media, no matter how illegal it is.
[01:25:58.966 --> 01:26:11.011]  And I would point out that their first responsibility and loyalty is to the Constitution and not to any non-disclosure forms they fill out.
[01:26:11.171 --> 01:26:16.834]  Many of them know that, but they know they could face jail time and loss of their jobs.
[01:26:16.914 --> 01:26:18.875]  So it's a big risk that it would take.
[01:26:19.495 --> 01:26:21.557]  However, Stellar Wind is still in practice.
[01:26:21.798 --> 01:26:27.383]  I understand Rahm Emanuel is now using it as much as Karl Rove used it during the Bush administration.
[01:26:27.403 --> 01:26:28.685]  And we've seen that in the news.
[01:26:28.705 --> 01:26:33.409]  I mean, hints of it that Congress people are sick of him calling up and threatening them.
[01:26:33.730 --> 01:26:34.911]  What would he threaten them with?
[01:26:35.393 --> 01:26:52.513]  Well, you know, if you've got access to people's private conversations and emails, you would know a lot about their financial situation, whether, you know, their plans for running for other office, for running for re-election, things that, you know, you keep in confidence until you make a decision to go public.
[01:26:53.053 --> 01:26:55.335]  Well, Emmanuel has all that information.
[01:26:55.355 --> 01:27:06.243]  That can be extremely useful in him pressuring members of Congress, pressuring elected governors, elected mayors around the country to get on his bandwagon or else.
[01:27:06.343 --> 01:27:14.710]  And I understand that has occurred and that largely led to people like Senator Dorgan and Governor of Colorado.
[01:27:15.470 --> 01:27:19.553]  And Senator Dodd is deciding to bail out.
[01:27:19.593 --> 01:27:32.961]  We may see other people bailing out before this is all said and done because they're just sick and tired of this lunatic Emanuel who likes to bang steak knives onto tables and yell, you know, you're dead, you're dead, you're dead.
[01:27:33.021 --> 01:27:39.866]  And he openly at congressional meetings when Obama says something he cracks knuckles and tells him, you know, you work for me.
[01:27:39.906 --> 01:27:41.287]  I mean, he's out of control.
[01:27:41.963 --> 01:27:43.384]  Yeah, he's out of control now.
[01:27:43.764 --> 01:27:50.509]  Sally Quinn quoted this, who's married to Ben Bradley, the former editor of the Washington Post.
[01:27:50.969 --> 01:27:56.413]  She's quoted this idea that Emanuel may leave this job as chief of staff and run for mayor of Chicago.
[01:27:56.813 --> 01:28:04.459]  Now, I hear that may just be a straw man, a red herring, but the cover for the fact that he may be leaving because some people want him gone.
[01:28:05.199 --> 01:28:09.424]  Yeah, all is not well when the chairman of the Democratic Party says this health care bill is a scam.
[01:28:21.351 --> 01:28:26.875]  Right, and I understand there's now bad blood between Emmanuel and Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago.
[01:28:26.935 --> 01:28:30.957]  Now, in that kind of contest, I'll bet on Daley to win out.
[01:28:31.397 --> 01:28:39.222]  Emmanuel may be in a lot of trouble and he may be just, since he's obviously insane, he may just be reaching out.
[01:28:39.282 --> 01:28:41.063]  He does act mentally unstable.
[01:28:41.104 --> 01:28:46.487]  Just when I'm watching him, like in the background on a news feed, he does act like an insane person.
[01:28:47.037 --> 01:28:50.178]  Yes, and you know, it's like a trapped wild animal.
[01:28:50.218 --> 01:28:53.780]  They're going to lash out, so be far away from what he does.
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:29:01.323]  So this idea that he may be threatening Daley with running for mayor of Chicago, I think is bravado on his part.
[01:29:02.063 --> 01:29:04.304]  I think he's looking at the end of his political career.
[01:29:04.364 --> 01:29:08.785]  And you know, he had designs to eventually become Speaker of the House representative.
[01:29:10.566 --> 01:29:11.086]  Amazing.
[01:29:13.470 --> 01:29:21.067]  They are threatening and intimidating and using NSA intercepts to get the healthcare legislation through.
[01:29:21.624 --> 01:29:22.465]  And everything else.
[01:29:22.525 --> 01:29:23.925]  Everything else that's on there.
[01:29:24.066 --> 01:29:24.906]  It doesn't matter.
[01:29:24.946 --> 01:29:29.109]  And I would say this even plays into the Middle East policy.
[01:29:29.249 --> 01:29:33.832]  George Mitchell has threatened Israel with cut off of their loan guarantees.
[01:29:33.932 --> 01:29:38.475]  And I would bet that Mitchell's phone call transcripts are now sitting in his manual.
[01:29:38.735 --> 01:29:42.057]  Alright, let's look into Obama's CIA background.
[01:29:42.077 --> 01:29:45.439]  Blocking his BIA information.
[01:29:45.459 --> 01:29:48.301]  And then we'll get into false flag and Blackwater.
[01:29:48.341 --> 01:29:49.822]  Big developments there with Wayne Madsen.
[01:29:51.192 --> 01:29:54.193]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.113 --> 01:29:57.893]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.954 --> 01:30:01.954]  What's your home worth?
[01:30:02.114 --> 01:30:04.055]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:30:04.235 --> 01:30:06.975]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[01:30:07.276 --> 01:30:14.797]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.

[01:31:02.429 --> 01:31:06.091]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:31:06.451 --> 01:31:09.473]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:31:09.693 --> 01:31:11.114]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:31:11.818 --> 01:31:14.481]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:31:14.501 --> 01:31:20.727]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:31:20.887 --> 01:31:25.931]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:31:25.951 --> 01:31:36.061]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:31:36.181 --> 01:31:38.282]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:31:38.523 --> 01:31:39.843]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:31:40.104 --> 01:31:42.385]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:31:42.565 --> 01:31:44.407]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:31:44.687 --> 01:31:49.510]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:31:49.850 --> 01:31:58.956]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:32:32.170 --> 01:32:32.770]  We're good to go!
[01:33:01.144 --> 01:33:04.990]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[01:33:08.815 --> 01:33:10.278]  No matter how hard you...
[01:33:14.810 --> 01:33:18.711]  We're going to cover three big issues that Wayne's been burrowing into.
[01:33:18.731 --> 01:33:20.552]  Just an amazing investigative journalist.
[01:33:21.212 --> 01:33:22.993]  So honored to have him part of our team.
[01:33:23.633 --> 01:33:27.935]  Before I do that, I want to thank a few of the sponsors that have made this hour possible.
[01:33:28.035 --> 01:33:29.235]  One of them is a Cola Blue.
[01:33:29.795 --> 01:33:34.037]  Did you know you could be drinking fresh, clean drinking water made right from the air you breathe?
[01:33:34.397 --> 01:33:37.518]  Though this isn't something out of a science fiction book, our sponsor, Cola Blue,
[01:33:38.746 --> 01:33:41.588]  Well, they're a Color Blue 28 and they're brand new at Color Blue 30 machines.
[01:33:41.948 --> 01:33:42.929]  We'll allow you to do just that.
[01:33:42.969 --> 01:33:47.473]  It's easy to use and it will make up to 7.5 gallons of water per day right out of the air you breathe.
[01:33:47.893 --> 01:33:50.915]  The water, once generated, passes through 7 in the Color Blue 28 or 12 in the Color Blue 30.
[01:33:50.955 --> 01:33:51.056]  Stage...
[01:33:54.338 --> 01:33:54.598]  Thank you.
[01:34:24.258 --> 01:34:24.338]  Yeah.
[01:34:25.419 --> 01:34:31.243]  Also, I want to tell you about efoodsdirect.com, the longest continually operating storable foods company in the nation.
[01:34:31.283 --> 01:34:33.445]  They don't sell you ancient 10-year-old crud.
[01:34:33.485 --> 01:34:36.047]  It's all packed on a weekly basis.
[01:34:36.127 --> 01:34:39.189]  Huge prepared food lines or raw food lines.
[01:34:39.209 --> 01:34:42.812]  They have organic, non-GMO, non-hybrid, incredible deals.
[01:34:43.212 --> 01:34:44.072]  And so much more.
[01:34:44.212 --> 01:34:45.433]  Check out their new and improved.
[01:34:45.453 --> 01:34:47.053]  It was already great, but now it's just amazing.

[01:34:50.974 --> 01:34:53.515]  Again, that's the letter E. foodsdirect.com.

[01:34:56.895 --> 01:35:00.996]  efoodsdirect.com.
[01:35:01.016 --> 01:35:02.117]  800-409-5633.
[01:35:02.137 --> 01:35:03.377]  800-409-5633.
[01:35:03.657 --> 01:35:05.918]  Also great for camping and things like that.
[01:35:06.018 --> 01:35:07.178]  efoodsdirect.com.
[01:35:07.458 --> 01:35:09.458]  And don't forget our guest, Wayne Madsen.
[01:35:09.718 --> 01:35:11.279]  A lot of stuff on his site is free.
[01:35:12.279 --> 01:35:23.609]  And he is a pundit on international television, writes for major publications, but a lot of incredibly amazing information is available for subscribers at WayneMadsonReport.com.
[01:35:23.929 --> 01:35:28.573]  Okay, Wayne, let's get into Obama and his records.
[01:35:29.073 --> 01:35:31.155]  Now, almost a year into his administration.
[01:35:31.195 --> 01:35:33.417]  We're two years into people trying to get him.
[01:35:33.758 --> 01:35:38.482]  No presidents, college records, business records, the first jobs he had.
[01:35:38.502 --> 01:35:41.045]  This is treated as a matter of national security.
[01:35:41.505 --> 01:35:45.869]  And we know he's connected into BIA, which was a known CIA front.
[01:35:46.110 --> 01:35:47.511]  Let's talk about Barack Obama.
[01:35:48.203 --> 01:35:56.012]  Well, we have to go back in time to 1981, when Barack Obama was known as Barry Satoro.
[01:35:56.072 --> 01:36:04.442]  His mother, Ann Dunham, had remarried an Indonesian man, and they had moved to Jakarta.
[01:36:06.344 --> 01:36:12.688]  Uh, Obama in those days was traveling on a Pakistani passport under the name of Barry Satoro.
[01:36:12.728 --> 01:36:20.814]  He went to Pakistan in 1981 and was hosted by the family of Muhammad Vian Soomro who, um,
[01:36:22.255 --> 01:36:27.878]  Believe it or not, he became President of Pakistan after the resignation of General Musharraf in 2008.
[01:36:28.378 --> 01:36:38.824]  So this was the family, obviously a family that was very close to the CIA at the time, because we have to remember what was going on in Pakistan in 1980 and 1981.
[01:36:39.245 --> 01:36:49.751]  Brzezinski, then followed by the Reagan administration, Bill Casey of the CIA, of using Pakistan as the main base for the Afghan-Mujahideen war against the Soviets.
[01:36:50.376 --> 01:36:51.977]  Who had invaded Afghanistan.
[01:36:52.057 --> 01:36:55.299]  So, this was a hotbed of CIA activity.
[01:36:56.260 --> 01:37:01.544]  Obama, or Sotoro, apparently went partridge hunting with the Sumeros.
[01:37:02.964 --> 01:37:04.906]  This is what the claim is, anyway.
[01:37:05.726 --> 01:37:11.470]  I understand he also traveled into India, across the Pakistan-India border.
[01:37:11.770 --> 01:37:13.852]  What he did in India, is anyone's guess?
[01:37:14.632 --> 01:37:32.982]  So we have basically someone who is traveling to Pakistan, whose stepfather Lolo Satoro was an Indonesian military officer who helped Soeharto take power in a military coup, and General Soeharto was basically run by the CIA.
[01:37:33.943 --> 01:37:39.386]  Obama's mother, Ann Dunham, was with the Ford Foundation and USAID.
[01:37:39.486 --> 01:37:43.068]  USAID is a known cipher for Central Intelligence.
[01:37:44.509 --> 01:37:49.030]  She was in Lahore, Pakistan at the same time her son was.
[01:37:50.971 --> 01:38:05.897]  We do know that Obama, after graduating from Columbia, went to work for Business International Corporation, which was a documented CIA front activity, and he was involved in publishing two newsletters.
[01:38:08.632 --> 01:38:09.214]  Excuse me.
[01:38:09.776 --> 01:38:13.988]  Financing Foreign Operations and Business International Money Report.
[01:38:16.578 --> 01:38:16.978]  Well, as I said,
[01:38:44.904 --> 01:39:14.304]  We have a president with these obvious holes in his background, and we have a president who is refusing to disclose his transcripts from both Occidental in Los Angeles, where he was an undergraduate, and from Columbia, where he finished up his undergraduate work before he went to law school at Harvard University.
[01:39:15.043 --> 01:39:17.265]  Why won't he release those records?
[01:39:19.627 --> 01:39:20.247]  We know this.
[01:39:20.287 --> 01:39:31.557]  He's a fully compromised individual and in a world of black ops, in a world of shadow government, they wouldn't let him into any sort of power if he wasn't fully compromised.
[01:39:32.492 --> 01:39:34.053]  Well, I believe this is the idea.
[01:39:34.074 --> 01:39:37.677]  This is what people are fearful of.
[01:39:37.737 --> 01:39:46.004]  We had a problem with George W. Bush because, remember, he said anything in his early youth was off the table.
[01:39:46.065 --> 01:39:49.888]  Then later we found out he was busted for cocaine possession.
[01:39:49.908 --> 01:39:51.129]  He was basically a drunk.
[01:39:53.883 --> 01:39:55.664]  I had problems with DWIs.
[01:39:56.684 --> 01:40:03.386]  But you know, this information we have some records of, just from arrest records, if anything else.
[01:40:03.446 --> 01:40:14.009]  But with Obama, we have basically this concerted effort to keep these, what should be records in the public domain, secret.
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:25.006]  And anytime the system wants to torpedo Obama, if he ever gets out of line, they've got this mausoleum full of skeletons to bring him to his knees.
[01:40:25.487 --> 01:40:36.434]  Shifting gears to false flag terror, with the underwear bomber, new developments there with your intel sources, and expanding on that as well.
[01:40:36.834 --> 01:40:45.240]  The false flag event, you were telling me during the break, and I've also seen this in the news, the residue of the bombing of the CIA command base,
[01:40:51.402 --> 01:41:09.207]  Well, we know, and now it's being reported in the Indian press, that a forward-based Chapman, which was where the bomb went off, the residue shows that it was from Pakistani ISI known previous bombing.
[01:41:10.168 --> 01:41:14.149]  So, nothing happens with the ISI.
[01:41:15.518 --> 01:41:17.239]  Without the CIA knowing about it.
[01:41:19.241 --> 01:41:20.782]  So why would that be done?
[01:41:20.802 --> 01:41:34.793]  Kind of like a Pentagon attack or a Fort Hood event to get the military all riled up and in support of retaliatory and expanding events, military sorties into Pakistan?
[01:41:35.638 --> 01:41:43.106]  Well, we know, even prior to the bombing in Kazakhstan, one of the generals over there was saying that the whole U.S.
[01:41:43.146 --> 01:41:47.331]  intelligence operations in Afghanistan were totally messed up.
[01:41:48.032 --> 01:41:49.493]  There was a big morale problem.
[01:41:50.555 --> 01:41:54.739]  So what better than to have an attack against a CIA base?
[01:41:55.971 --> 01:41:57.411]  Let me ask you this.
[01:42:26.633 --> 01:42:26.994]  Go ahead.
[01:42:27.816 --> 01:42:29.340]  Oh, go ahead.
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:31.485]  No, I mean add to that point and then I have another question.
[01:42:32.325 --> 01:42:42.914]  Well, so we have this officer, Jordanian officer, Sharif, who brings this guy, Balawi, into the CIA employment in Afghanistan.
[01:42:43.435 --> 01:42:44.476]  And where was the vetting?
[01:42:45.256 --> 01:42:53.483]  Now we find out that some of the residue explosive material at Camp Chapman was from ISI sources.
[01:42:55.005 --> 01:42:59.789]  Was this the CIA sacrificing some of its own agents?
[01:43:00.282 --> 01:43:04.888]  The push of political agenda which would make it yet another one of these false flag attacks.
[01:43:07.110 --> 01:43:08.351]  Well, we know the M.O.
[01:43:08.371 --> 01:43:10.893]  of these people always shows this.
[01:43:11.413 --> 01:43:27.183]  Going back to Blackwater, going back to the White House trying to persecute reporters and their sources, what you said literally five years ago, what Tarpley said, what many others said five, six years ago, has now been confirmed that Blackwater was running hit teams.
[01:43:27.243 --> 01:43:28.584]  They say they were themselves.
[01:43:29.365 --> 01:43:31.927]  Just a few years ago, they threatened to sue you if you said that.
[01:43:32.387 --> 01:43:36.690]  Now, they're just out in the open, admitting they're running hit teams all over the world.
[01:43:37.770 --> 01:43:39.912]  All this corruption coming out of Blackwater.
[01:43:40.072 --> 01:43:43.635]  Blackwater's set to get a billion dollar contract.
[01:43:44.375 --> 01:43:46.757]  Obama is fully embracing them.
[01:43:46.777 --> 01:43:53.061]  I want your comment on that and then secondarily I ended up getting contacted
[01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:55.580]  We're good.
[01:44:18.797 --> 01:44:23.900]  Well, I definitely think that Blackwater was basically used as a CIA proprietary.
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:26.681]  Eric Prince, of course, already had a lot of money.
[01:44:26.701 --> 01:44:28.662]  He inherited from his father, Edgar Prince, a big automotive
[01:44:47.282 --> 01:44:47.762]  I think so.
[01:45:02.937 --> 01:45:06.099]  And then he ups the ante and says give me a billion dollar contract.
[01:45:31.980 --> 01:45:33.401]  Exactly, and this is what he's doing.
[01:45:33.421 --> 01:45:34.542]  This is called graymailing.
[01:45:34.642 --> 01:45:36.984]  Oliver North did it during his trial.
[01:45:37.024 --> 01:45:42.648]  That's why they threw all the charges out against North, because he was in a position to bring down the Reagan administration.
[01:45:42.668 --> 01:45:44.409]  It's really the same thing here.
[01:45:44.829 --> 01:45:54.916]  It's the same tactic being used, and Prince is using it, I would say, with a lot of advice from people at the CIA urging him on.
[01:45:55.997 --> 01:45:59.058]  And he's not worried about having a kayak accident.
[01:46:12.370 --> 01:46:13.211]  I don't think so.
[01:46:13.471 --> 01:46:30.384]  I mean, I think Prince is basically doing this with a wink and a nod from people in the CIA, because he knows that the members of Congress, the Intelligence Oversight Committees, are going to get the message loud and clear about graymailing, and so is the Obama administration.
[01:46:30.444 --> 01:46:34.868]  Hence, we see that they're prepared to give him this big contract to train the Afghans.
[01:46:34.948 --> 01:46:41.313]  And notice now, it doesn't matter how many of his employees get indicted, how bad it gets, they say, Blackwater is suddenly wonderful again.
[01:46:42.262 --> 01:46:46.664]  That's right, and what we know about their activities, I see Judge T.S.
[01:46:46.764 --> 01:46:55.028]  Ellis here in the Eastern District of Virginia, what's known as the CIA Rocket Docket, in Alexandria, threw out the lawsuits against Blackwater.
[01:46:55.068 --> 01:47:03.932]  But there was a John Doe II and a John Doe I, former Blackwater employees, that said this company was involved in everything from child prostitution to tax evasion.
[01:47:04.312 --> 01:47:09.493]  To money laundering, to drug smuggling, to weapon smuggling, you name it, this company was involved with it.
[01:47:09.874 --> 01:47:14.835]  And of course, Prince knows that, and that's why he's basically graymailing.
[01:47:15.155 --> 01:47:16.195]  I call it blackmail.
[01:47:16.215 --> 01:47:32.700]  I think they're letting him off the hook by calling it graymailing, but blackmail is illegal, so he's graymailing the government and saying, look, I can release even more if you Justice Department lawyers want to play games with me.
[01:47:35.143 --> 01:47:37.304]  And clearly the Army is in a turf war.
[01:47:37.344 --> 01:47:38.504]  They don't like Blackwater.
[01:47:39.524 --> 01:47:41.805]  No, and most uniformed people don't.
[01:47:41.865 --> 01:47:54.048]  Not only because of the wage disparity between the low wages paid to our military uniformed personnel as opposed to the money that the Blackwaters of the world make, but also the fact is
[01:47:54.588 --> 01:48:10.945]  When these mercenaries in their civilian garb commit an atrocity, the retaliation, people are going to look for the guys wearing the American patch on their uniform and they're the ones who are going to get retaliated against.
[01:48:10.965 --> 01:48:13.628]  The uniformed personnel are sick and tired of
[01:48:13.988 --> 01:48:22.110]  Being the targets for atrocities committed by these mercenaries like Blackwater and the others out there.
[01:48:25.251 --> 01:48:40.296]  I've been told this by people, actually long before Iraq and Afghanistan, when some of these mercenaries were starting to show up in Africa, uniformed officers were telling me that they despised the presence of these people on the
[01:48:40.356 --> 01:48:42.596]  Well, look at what Sybil Edmonds says she got.
[01:48:43.077 --> 01:48:51.958]  She was listening to the FBI intercepts at the FBI, and it was the CIA involved in child kidnapping, involved in narcotics trafficking.
[01:48:52.978 --> 01:48:55.959]  And, I mean, these people are just pure evil.
[01:48:56.639 --> 01:48:58.219]  Let's take a call or two here.
[01:48:58.519 --> 01:48:59.860]  Let's talk to Mark in Georgia.
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:01.200]  You're on the air with Wayne Madsen.
[01:49:01.220 --> 01:49:01.880]  Go ahead, Mark.
[01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:03.180]  Hi.
[01:49:03.260 --> 01:49:03.940]  God bless you.
[01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:04.981]  You're ever in our prayers.
[01:49:05.061 --> 01:49:07.281]  I guess I've used that one a few times.
[01:49:08.119 --> 01:49:14.604]  Um, this may be a bit off-topic, um, Pharaten is the Greek word that's translated as beast in Revelation 13.
[01:49:14.744 --> 01:49:24.990]  I believe we're looking at the writer with the scales, which, when people are hungry and homeless and desperate, they may do things that they would not otherwise do.
[01:49:25.911 --> 01:49:28.853]  Um, I think we need to recognize that this
[01:49:29.585 --> 01:49:37.948]  That system is not merely corporeal, and I understand you're getting upset about things that people have said before that sounds defeatist, so I think we want to clarify.
[01:49:38.609 --> 01:49:42.650]  Every pocket of resistance that does not bow to the beast is a victory.
[01:49:43.851 --> 01:49:47.972]  Mark, I appreciate your call, and I'm going for questions here for Wayne Madsen.
[01:49:48.953 --> 01:49:51.133]  Paul in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:49:51.794 --> 01:49:52.454]  Hello, Alex.
[01:49:53.114 --> 01:49:53.494]  Go ahead.
[01:49:54.535 --> 01:49:57.596]  Yes, my issue for question for him is about the brain scanners.
[01:49:58.755 --> 01:50:02.019]  And I'm one of the groups that's going to target with it actually.
[01:50:03.100 --> 01:50:06.563]  You might say this is immoral, but I certainly don't think it should be criminal.
[01:50:07.224 --> 01:50:11.609]  I'm a racist and I have severe concerns.
[01:50:12.279 --> 01:50:19.744]  All right, let me stop and get a comment from Wayne.
[01:50:20.525 --> 01:50:21.706]  This is all quackery.
[01:50:21.746 --> 01:50:26.890]  What they do is they say these defense companies make money off the body scanners, now they say brain scanners.
[01:50:27.210 --> 01:50:28.171]  It's like lie detectors.
[01:50:28.211 --> 01:50:30.792]  It's just a new quack machine to say you're guilty.
[01:50:30.832 --> 01:50:31.373]  Wayne Madsen.
[01:50:31.823 --> 01:50:32.704]  Yep, we'll be back.
[01:50:32.744 --> 01:50:33.144]  More calls.
[01:51:01.164 --> 01:51:04.346]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[01:51:04.687 --> 01:51:06.428]  Now, going green can save money.

[01:51:58.781 --> 01:52:05.833]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:52:06.213 --> 01:52:09.178]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:52:11.559 --> 01:52:14.220]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:20.462]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:52:20.622 --> 01:52:25.644]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:52:26.164 --> 01:52:35.788]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:52:35.908 --> 01:52:38.030]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:52:38.270 --> 01:52:39.591]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:52:39.851 --> 01:52:42.133]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:52:42.314 --> 01:52:44.155]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:52:44.175 --> 01:52:49.200]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:54:24.839 --> 01:54:26.600]  All right, I should have gone to calls earlier.
[01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:37.826]  I just greedily want to sit here and ask Wayne Madsen question after question and issue after issue, but we're going to continue throughout the week with more extremely powerful and informative guests.
[01:54:37.866 --> 01:54:39.487]  I'm just going to leave it at that for you this week.
[01:54:39.787 --> 01:54:43.929]  We've got some giant, groundbreaking guests lined up here on the show.
[01:54:44.530 --> 01:54:48.272]  Michael in Illinois, you're on the air with Wayne Madsen and waynemadsenreport.com.
[01:54:48.312 --> 01:54:48.892]  Go ahead, Michael.
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:51.200]  Hey guys, cool.
[01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:52.881]  God bless, first of all.
[01:54:53.001 --> 01:55:02.822]  I want to ask about the whole Fed audit situation and what makes you guys think that if there is an audit, we've seen the length these guys will go to cover their tracks.
[01:55:02.902 --> 01:55:16.845]  Okay, nothing's perfect, but we're identifying the bankers as the oligarchy and Congress has the purview to run our banking system and our currency and credit and so we want it back to Congress because at least it's public and accountable.
[01:55:16.885 --> 01:55:17.425]  Wayne Madsen.
[01:55:18.177 --> 01:55:18.998]  Well, certainly.
[01:55:19.078 --> 01:55:23.961]  Anytime you have an audit of anything, you're going to be able to get documentation.
[01:55:24.421 --> 01:55:41.473]  It's the same thing why I favor civilian trials of these so-called terrorists, because through discovery and cross-examination, we're going to get a lot more information about who they're working for and their networks than we would get from a military tribunal.
[01:55:41.513 --> 01:55:42.454]  Same thing with an audit.
[01:55:43.915 --> 01:55:54.879]  Well, Wayne, I mean, the spin out there has been, don't audit the Fed.
[01:55:55.060 --> 01:55:56.180]  They'll win if you do.
[01:55:56.620 --> 01:56:00.662]  The Fed is fighting with everything they've got to not be audited.
[01:56:01.222 --> 01:56:03.343]  And, I mean, Michael, what are you getting at?
[01:56:03.383 --> 01:56:04.784]  We just let them continue on?
[01:56:04.824 --> 01:56:05.544]  We don't audit them?
[01:56:05.564 --> 01:56:06.725]  We don't try to abolish them?
[01:56:07.766 --> 01:56:10.351]  I think we should go after them criminally like you said.
[01:56:11.633 --> 01:56:16.122]  I agree but an audit will get them criminally.
[01:56:16.422 --> 01:56:16.663]  Wayne?
[01:56:18.225 --> 01:56:18.785]  Absolutely.
[01:56:19.565 --> 01:56:21.146]  You have to get the documentation.
[01:56:21.166 --> 01:56:27.507]  You know, before the IRS decides to indict somebody for tax fraud, they audit them.
[01:56:27.687 --> 01:56:29.927]  So it's the same thing here with the Federal Reserve.
[01:56:30.308 --> 01:56:34.928]  You can't just say they've committed a criminal act without, you've got to have evidence.
[01:56:35.269 --> 01:56:40.610]  And you only can get that kind of evidence because we're dealing in very complicated financial systems.
[01:56:40.630 --> 01:56:42.550]  You're only going to get that evidence through an audit.
[01:56:43.030 --> 01:56:44.532]  Michael, I understand your point.
[01:56:44.592 --> 01:56:45.693]  You want something more.
[01:56:45.753 --> 01:56:49.177]  But Ron Paul has said, you audit the Fed, you abolish them.
[01:56:49.418 --> 01:56:51.160]  We know all the fraud they've engaged in.
[01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:54.383]  Once we have it all, look at Geithner in these emails.
[01:56:54.784 --> 01:56:55.885]  He's about to go under.
[01:56:55.965 --> 01:56:57.968]  Believe me, we want it all, don't we, Wayne?
[01:56:58.775 --> 01:57:00.116]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:57:00.136 --> 01:57:05.360]  But you've got to start somewhere, and an audit sounds perfectly reasonable.
[01:57:05.420 --> 01:57:12.025]  And notice, for two years the Fed fighting an audit, and now starting to lose, that makes them look really guilty, doesn't it, Wayne?
[01:57:12.225 --> 01:57:15.607]  The fact that they're like, no, no, no, no, don't look, don't look!
[01:57:16.248 --> 01:57:19.610]  Well, if they act like they've got something to hide, they probably do.
[01:57:21.191 --> 01:57:22.312]  Michael, anything else?
[01:57:23.013 --> 01:57:25.915]  Yeah, you said Obama is compromised, and obviously he is.
[01:57:26.698 --> 01:57:33.623]  What are the, what is the likelihood that he's been set up to take a fall no matter what if there's too much heat that comes, uh, comes down?
[01:57:33.643 --> 01:57:36.104]  I agree, they always flush presidents down the toilet.
[01:57:36.384 --> 01:57:46.031]  That's why we point out when he was powerful and a rock star, he was a betrayer, and my films that Wayne is in, Fall of the Republic, we say now look out, it's the next guy you gotta worry about.
[01:57:49.020 --> 01:58:00.345]  And we saw that with Jimmy Carter, how they basically used him and, you know, here was a guy who, once he served their purposes, they got rid of him and replaced him with Ronald Reagan.
[01:58:00.565 --> 01:58:02.466]  Yeah, nobody said this was easy, Michael.
[01:58:02.546 --> 01:58:06.128]  It's generally educating the public about how things really work.
[01:58:06.688 --> 01:58:10.330]  As Thomas Jefferson said, educate the public, liberty will flow from that.
[01:58:11.130 --> 01:58:14.732]  And educate them about the ways of elites and how they operate and we can stop them.
[01:58:15.092 --> 01:58:15.913]  I appreciate your call.
[01:58:15.973 --> 01:58:17.574]  Sorry to Terry, Ralph, Kip and others.
[01:58:17.594 --> 01:58:18.374]  Call me back tomorrow.
[01:58:18.654 --> 01:58:22.957]  Retransmission is going to be amazing in the first hour as I break down BankerGate.
[01:58:23.397 --> 01:58:27.780]  That starts in just a few minutes on the audio streams at InfoWars.com on the AM and FM dial.
[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:30.501]  Wayne Madsen, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:58:30.921 --> 01:58:31.682]  Good to be with you.
[01:58:32.202 --> 01:58:32.923]  Take care, my friend.
[01:58:33.183 --> 01:58:34.063]  Great job, crew!
[01:58:34.323 --> 01:58:36.265]  We'll be right back on the other side in one minute.
[01:58:36.285 --> 01:58:36.725]  Stay with us.
[01:58:42.663 --> 01:58:43.577]  Thank you for listening.
