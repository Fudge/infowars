[00:00:02.455 --> 00:00:06.658]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:08.099]  You want answers?
[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.821]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:10.421 --> 00:00:14.004]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:14.624 --> 00:00:18.727]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.217 --> 00:00:27.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.144]  It is Monday, the 15th day of November, 2010.
[00:00:31.945 --> 00:00:37.932]  On yesterday's Sunday broadcast, I didn't really get into the TSA.
[00:00:39.158 --> 00:00:48.105]  But today we're going to be discussing it in great detail and also getting into the economy and the ongoing investigation of what happened on 9-11.
[00:00:48.145 --> 00:00:49.426]  That is all coming up.
[00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:57.913]  But there have been giant developments on the Mueller station frisk that are going on and the naked body scanners.
[00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:05.419]  Steve Watson is writing a detailed report right now.
[00:01:08.695 --> 00:01:19.544]  For those that ask, why do you cover this so much?
[00:01:19.624 --> 00:01:23.086]  Because it's now one of, if not the biggest stories in the world.
[00:01:24.067 --> 00:01:29.131]  It's a substantive story forced out into the mainstream by the alternative media.
[00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:50.155]  And if the globalists are able to put these naked body scanners in all the airports and train us to submit to it, and train us to submit to having our women and children have their crotches and breasts grabbed, and ourselves having our crotches grabbed, they can get away with anything.
[00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:54.018]  This is social conditioning, period, and Homeland Security now admits that.
[00:01:57.011 --> 00:02:20.588]  But, just about 30 minutes ago, live on CNN, we'll play this clip when we come back, they had Mr. Pistol, the head of the TSA on, the minion of Big Sis, Janet Napolitano, and the reporter said, well, why do you trust a pilot to fly a plane, but you want to frisk them and touch their genitals?
[00:02:21.943 --> 00:02:32.351]  And the head of the TSA, when confronted with common sense, see, they try to just get away with this stuff, and they know the more brazen, the more they can get away with, the more you'll accept in the future.
[00:02:32.872 --> 00:02:35.074]  We're being brought into submission.
[00:02:35.614 --> 00:02:36.575]  We're being dominated.
[00:02:40.218 --> 00:02:49.685]  So, Mr. Pistol, the head of the TSA, says, well, yes, I don't want to announce this now, but he's like a deer in the headlights, hit with common sense.
[00:02:50.717 --> 00:02:54.318]  And notice, just CNN two weeks ago was saying how great the naked body scans were.
[00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:56.639]  They were saying how great it was to be frisked.
[00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.500]  But now they have a Reuters poll.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:09.484]  97% of over 60,000 respondents say that they are not going to fly because of this.
[00:03:10.985 --> 00:03:16.347]  CNN admits they're losing over $9 billion a year just in lost travel, and I'll guarantee it's worse than that in the U.S.
[00:03:16.387 --> 00:03:16.667]  alone.
[00:03:16.987 --> 00:03:18.247]  Foreign travel to the U.S.
[00:03:18.307 --> 00:03:19.248]  is down by over a third.
[00:03:21.994 --> 00:03:24.175]  Commerce killing terrorism.
[00:03:24.455 --> 00:03:25.295]  That's the plan.
[00:03:26.135 --> 00:03:28.356]  So I want to walk through why this is so important.
[00:03:28.856 --> 00:03:31.176]  But there they are starting to capitulate.
[00:03:32.077 --> 00:03:33.937]  Okay, yes, the pilots are trusted.
[00:03:33.977 --> 00:03:35.338]  Yes, they do fly the plane.
[00:03:35.998 --> 00:03:41.939]  I don't want to make the announcement now, but yes, we're getting ready to have a lighter frisk of them.
[00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:44.160]  Because you see, this is a strike.
[00:03:45.703 --> 00:03:46.464]  A worker strike.
[00:03:46.584 --> 00:03:53.069]  If the flight attendants and pilots say, you know what, I'm not having some minimum wage person on a power trip grab my genitals.
[00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:54.571]  That's already happening.
[00:03:55.071 --> 00:03:57.033]  All the major unions are saying it's over.
[00:03:57.453 --> 00:04:02.097]  And they went into meetings Friday with Napolitano, and she said, I don't care at all, it's going to continue.
[00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:09.524]  And now she put out a USA Today report today that is all lies.
[00:04:09.664 --> 00:04:13.187]  And I got in this morning and I was reading it,
[00:04:14.488 --> 00:04:23.812]  I got in about 7.30 this morning here to the office, and it's just all lies, and it made my head spin, because there's so many lies.
[00:04:26.273 --> 00:04:41.159]  Like she says, John Hopkins University has certified that the scanners are safe, and I went, I went, wait a minute, I just read John Hopkins in the French news agency, their radiation department, radiology department, saying these things are very dangerous, and then I dug in my stack and there it was.
[00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:42.680]  It's all lies!
[00:04:44.212 --> 00:04:50.335]  Wait till I go, I mean, that's the big scandal is how much disdain they have for us.
[00:04:50.355 --> 00:04:51.395]  We're going to cover when we come back.
[00:04:51.415 --> 00:04:51.996]  This is big.
[00:04:52.416 --> 00:04:53.096]  This is big.
[00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:04.001]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:05:04.961 --> 00:05:09.744]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:05:10.104 --> 00:05:11.584]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[00:05:14.175 --> 00:05:16.896]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:05:18.817 --> 00:05:22.219]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.361]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:05:25.381 --> 00:05:31.204]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:05:31.904 --> 00:05:35.026]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.852]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:05:39.112 --> 00:05:40.614]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:05:40.894 --> 00:05:43.476]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:50.552]  Thank you!
[00:08:02.659 --> 00:08:06.864]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:07.505 --> 00:08:08.305]  You want answers?
[00:08:09.086 --> 00:08:10.047]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:10.628 --> 00:08:14.513]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.833 --> 00:08:18.878]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:21.365 --> 00:08:30.892]  The social engineers that are building this new world order have been pushing and pushing and doing more and more outrageous things.
[00:08:31.893 --> 00:08:34.514]  Trying to sell us on tyranny.
[00:08:35.695 --> 00:08:37.797]  Always how they're doing it for our own good.
[00:08:39.441 --> 00:08:46.864]  Oh, we don't care if the majority of flyers in major polls don't want to be naked body scanned, or don't want to have their genitals squeezed.
[00:08:46.944 --> 00:08:51.286]  We're doing this to protect passengers, when passengers are flyers.
[00:08:53.306 --> 00:08:59.068]  And there's a full spectrum of this I want to cover, because I didn't really get into it yesterday, and there's been big developments since then.
[00:08:59.088 --> 00:09:00.929]  But the overall issue is this.
[00:09:01.649 --> 00:09:05.411]  The American people are learning how to find their spine again.
[00:09:06.462 --> 00:09:09.465]  The American people are learning how to get angry again.
[00:09:10.165 --> 00:09:15.290]  The American people are learning how to say no and use common sense again.
[00:09:16.491 --> 00:09:21.415]  For years, they've done the scans and the pat-downs at select airports of pilots.
[00:09:22.216 --> 00:09:30.864]  Why would you trust a pilot to fly a plane that they could use as a weapon or crash if you don't trust them to go through security without being searched?
[00:09:33.117 --> 00:09:40.084]  This is about the federal government engaged in a giant power grab over the 9th and 10th Amendment of states' rights.
[00:09:40.505 --> 00:09:45.209]  It's about the seizure of the infrastructure and commerce in this country.
[00:09:46.391 --> 00:09:51.936]  The power to control the roads and the airwaves, the airways, is the power to destroy.
[00:09:52.811 --> 00:10:11.524]  And it is a huge federal power grab over the state's homeland security for years, has already had drills and real operations at checkpoints on highways, bus terminals, train stations, from Houston, Texas to Boston, Massachusetts, from Los Angeles, California to Las Vegas, Nevada.
[00:10:12.044 --> 00:10:14.586]  They are doing it everywhere and announcing.
[00:10:15.266 --> 00:10:22.531]  See, oh, if there's a printer bomb or any other type of bomb in a city at a shopping mall, that's it.
[00:10:23.251 --> 00:10:26.613]  TSA's gotta come take it over, you've gotta go through it.
[00:10:26.953 --> 00:10:32.595]  If there's ever a bombing on a highway, sorry, from now on, to get in your car, you've gotta go through a security check.
[00:10:32.835 --> 00:10:33.636]  I'm not joking.
[00:10:36.237 --> 00:10:45.321]  Toyota and others, for years, have talked about live cameras in your car, hooked to the police department, and kill switches being designed into the cars.
[00:10:45.621 --> 00:10:47.122]  This is all now being announced.
[00:10:47.984 --> 00:10:52.787]  This is a total electronic straitjacket by the people that want to protect us.
[00:10:52.828 --> 00:10:54.729]  Yeah, they want to protect their milk cows.
[00:10:55.670 --> 00:11:00.273]  They want to make sure that we produce for them, and that we don't have an underground economy.
[00:11:00.833 --> 00:11:07.638]  You notice we see reports every week, before I get into these latest developments on the TSA, because it all ties together, and this ongoing revolt.
[00:11:08.239 --> 00:11:09.379]  We see articles every week.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.662]  Oh, little girls had a lemonade stand in their neighborhood.
[00:11:13.302 --> 00:11:16.725]  They were fined hundreds and hundreds of dollars and threatened with jail.
[00:11:18.001 --> 00:11:20.445]  Because a code enforcer saw it and came after him.
[00:11:21.125 --> 00:11:24.971]  Listen, prisoner, you don't have a garage sale without paying us money.
[00:11:25.432 --> 00:11:28.055]  Listen, prisoner, you don't mow yards for cash.
[00:11:28.676 --> 00:11:31.060]  Listen, prisoner, you don't do anything.
[00:11:32.366 --> 00:11:33.346]  That we say you can't.
[00:11:33.647 --> 00:11:33.787]  Oh!
[00:11:34.627 --> 00:11:43.870]  The illegal aliens are offended in Texas and Arizona and New Mexico and California and Colorado by American flags.
[00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:45.491]  They pull them down everywhere they see them.
[00:11:46.311 --> 00:11:50.713]  And on Veterans Day, a 13-year-old flies an American flag on the back of his bike.
[00:11:51.233 --> 00:11:54.034]  Well, he's told he can't have the bike.
[00:11:54.374 --> 00:11:57.676]  And it's right here on KCRA television.
[00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.453]  That the illegal aliens say they don't like the American flag.
[00:12:02.513 --> 00:12:08.558]  I mean, again, in America, the good guys are the bad guys.
[00:12:08.598 --> 00:12:09.278]  You understand that?
[00:12:09.879 --> 00:12:11.600]  Because the globalists run the country.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.542]  They hate this country as well.
[00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:19.593]  And we're supposed to be politically correct and go, oh, Mexico teaches in schools to hate the U.S.
[00:12:20.074 --> 00:12:22.636]  Mexico teaches that the Southwest was stolen from them.
[00:12:23.196 --> 00:12:34.324]  Mexico, you know, is this narco-terrorist collapsed state, but we better not have American flags because it offends the illegal aliens, who are now basically half the population of California.
[00:12:34.704 --> 00:12:36.005]  Those new statistics just came out.
[00:12:38.601 --> 00:12:39.161]  It's amazing.
[00:12:39.521 --> 00:12:40.502]  And here's another one.
[00:12:41.082 --> 00:12:44.864]  And I want to put this up on screen if we can and show this slime ball.
[00:12:45.264 --> 00:12:46.565]  Michael Wolfsonson.
[00:12:47.985 --> 00:12:52.967]  It says, Newcastle Councilman Calls Cops on Boys' Cupcake Sale.
[00:12:53.388 --> 00:12:55.869]  I'm always seeing crazy stuff out of Newcastle.
[00:13:00.091 --> 00:13:01.651]  This is Newcastle, New York.
[00:13:01.771 --> 00:13:04.933]  There's another one in Pennsylvania I see crazy stuff out of.
[00:13:06.295 --> 00:13:10.537]  And it says, Newcastle Councilman Calls Cops on Boys Cupcake Sale.
[00:13:11.577 --> 00:13:26.884]  When Andrew DeMarchis and Kevin Graff, two 13-year-olds from Seven Bridges Middle School, set up a shop at the Gennary Park on a fall weekend last month, they were expecting a tidy profit.
[00:13:27.404 --> 00:13:33.247]  Instead, the two wannabe entrepreneurs selling cupcakes, cookies, brownies, and Rice Krispie treats
[00:13:37.142 --> 00:13:43.407]  For one dollar a piece, got a good taste of hard bureaucracy.
[00:13:44.347 --> 00:13:54.354]  And it goes on, Newcastle Councilman Michael Wolfdenson came up and came upon the sale and called the cops on the kids for operating without a license.
[00:13:55.255 --> 00:13:56.476]  And it just goes on from there.
[00:13:57.056 --> 00:13:57.757]  And there he is.
[00:13:57.817 --> 00:13:58.818]  See, he's a...
[00:13:59.912 --> 00:14:00.833]  He's your master.
[00:14:00.893 --> 00:14:01.773]  He's your owner.
[00:14:02.454 --> 00:14:04.415]  And everything has to go through him.
[00:14:04.475 --> 00:14:07.917]  There's no commerce unless he gets his slice, his cut.
[00:14:08.618 --> 00:14:13.240]  And most of the money in our cities and counties and states goes to pay the national debt.
[00:14:14.101 --> 00:14:18.484]  Even if you're a state government or a local government, they've invested in the derivatives.
[00:14:20.185 --> 00:14:21.146]  That private debt.
[00:14:21.626 --> 00:14:23.207]  And so, most of the money's gone.
[00:14:24.915 --> 00:14:28.478]  And these city council people, they play off public ignorance.
[00:14:28.518 --> 00:14:30.139]  That's their credo.
[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:37.304]  Is that they know, the public doesn't know, that the budget is only one part of the money they tell you about.
[00:14:37.765 --> 00:14:44.490]  That's their expenditures, not their total receipts and investments, which is the annual comprehensive financial report.
[00:14:45.865 --> 00:14:46.905]  See, they don't tell you that.
[00:14:47.486 --> 00:14:53.368]  And so, this guy literally sees everybody as his property, and he sees children selling cupcakes.
[00:14:53.849 --> 00:14:55.149]  That's not going to be allowed.
[00:14:55.209 --> 00:15:02.993]  Now, I'll guarantee you, in his town, there are illegal aliens driving without a driver's license, without insurance, working, without paying Social Security.
[00:15:03.633 --> 00:15:08.055]  He automatically knows, in land of the coward, home of the slaves, that that's okay.
[00:15:09.292 --> 00:15:10.454]  Because that's part of the plan.
[00:15:10.794 --> 00:15:15.322]  The government teamed up with the third world labor to drive down the wages and consolidate control.
[00:15:15.883 --> 00:15:19.349]  But he sees some young citizens selling cupcakes.
[00:15:19.549 --> 00:15:19.950]  It's over.
[00:15:21.363 --> 00:15:25.624]  And so, he didn't just come up and say, hey kids, you need to get a license to do this.
[00:15:25.945 --> 00:15:27.265]  He called the police.
[00:15:27.625 --> 00:15:29.466]  He called his enforcers.
[00:15:30.346 --> 00:15:33.647]  Hey kid, don't have that American flag on your bike.
[00:15:33.787 --> 00:15:35.268]  Don't have an American flag on your shirt.
[00:15:36.108 --> 00:15:38.169]  And we're going to suspend you.
[00:15:38.209 --> 00:15:39.289]  We're going to expel you.
[00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:41.330]  Remember up in San Francisco?
[00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:44.871]  Turned out most of the kids wearing American flags were Hispanic.
[00:15:45.751 --> 00:15:47.512]  And the school had a policy, look, you don't
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.281]  You don't wear American flags.
[00:15:50.341 --> 00:15:53.064]  And first the media said, well that was only on Cinco de Mayo.
[00:15:53.124 --> 00:15:54.125]  No, it's any day.
[00:15:55.186 --> 00:15:59.030]  Just like this new report shows in another town in California, a small town.
[00:15:59.871 --> 00:16:09.199]  And then they admit they said, well, the Hispanic students didn't like the American flag.
[00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:10.100]  They're offended by it.
[00:16:10.521 --> 00:16:12.743]  That's in the KTXL update on this.
[00:16:15.267 --> 00:16:18.048]  Wait a minute, I mean Hispanics, that's just a media term.
[00:16:18.588 --> 00:16:24.871]  That's somebody from Puerto Rico, somebody from Brazil, somebody from Argentina, Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador.
[00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:31.673]  Or for that matter, I guess you could say it could be somebody from Spain, Latin.
[00:16:33.374 --> 00:16:36.695]  So see how the media says all Hispanics want open borders.
[00:16:37.015 --> 00:16:39.196]  The actual polls show over 70 plus percent don't.
[00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:41.982]  But no, they don't call this what it is.
[00:16:42.422 --> 00:16:47.549]  This is highly nationalistic, America-hating games.
[00:16:50.785 --> 00:17:00.512]  See, Mexico isn't the old-fashioned tyranny that it was decades ago, where there were hard-working folks down there and there was just some corruption over them.
[00:17:00.912 --> 00:17:02.814]  Mexico has doubled its population.
[00:17:02.914 --> 00:17:04.215]  It's a hellhole now.
[00:17:04.655 --> 00:17:06.937]  The people are all fighting with each other down there.
[00:17:07.878 --> 00:17:11.000]  The number one sales item is bulletproof cars.
[00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:12.841]  That's the big boom down there.
[00:17:12.861 --> 00:17:16.524]  28,000 dead in the last two years.
[00:17:16.564 --> 00:17:19.026]  That's worse than, you know, per year in Vietnam.
[00:17:20.544 --> 00:17:30.966]  And the illegals are up here and they see a bunch of fat, weak, domesticated, cowardly Americans who are trained to lick boots up and down.
[00:17:31.326 --> 00:17:34.647]  Nobody worldwide puts up with their wife and children having their genitals grabbed.
[00:17:34.967 --> 00:17:37.147]  North Korea doesn't even do that unless you've been arrested.
[00:17:37.547 --> 00:17:38.367]  I've gone and looked it up.
[00:17:39.968 --> 00:17:45.789]  See, we're so into how free we are and how tough we are that we're really a bunch of cowardly jellyfish.
[00:17:46.149 --> 00:17:47.029]  And so you've got these
[00:17:48.948 --> 00:17:57.405]  Hardcore people from Mexico up here who've been taught that this country belongs to them and they see an American flag.
[00:17:58.402 --> 00:17:59.763]  It gets torn off somebody's car.
[00:17:59.943 --> 00:18:01.083]  They see it at a post office.
[00:18:01.123 --> 00:18:03.004]  It gets torn down and the Mexican flag gets run up.
[00:18:03.524 --> 00:18:05.184]  They see kids wearing American flags?
[00:18:05.525 --> 00:18:06.345]  Hispanic kids?
[00:18:06.785 --> 00:18:08.766]  Hey, you take that stinking shirt off, buddy.
[00:18:08.806 --> 00:18:10.026]  This is Mexico, you understand?
[00:18:10.306 --> 00:18:12.967]  And the school comes in and says, that's right, take it off.
[00:18:13.787 --> 00:18:16.448]  And by the way, they admit Mexican flags are allowed.
[00:18:17.249 --> 00:18:18.509]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[00:18:18.729 --> 00:18:22.471]  Because again, the people that run this government hate this country.
[00:18:22.511 --> 00:18:23.211]  They're globalist.
[00:18:23.951 --> 00:18:26.472]  They'll work with anybody to bring this country down.
[00:18:26.753 --> 00:18:32.576]  Because as soon as your Bill of Rights and Constitution is gone, and it basically is gone now, they're going to take everything you've got.
[00:18:35.137 --> 00:18:38.719]  You know, talking about discrimination, there's now 111 giant firms like
[00:18:45.171 --> 00:18:51.496]  Walmart and companies like McDonald's that don't have to buy insurance for anybody.
[00:18:52.257 --> 00:19:00.004]  How is anybody going to compete if you've got a five and dime and you've got to buy expensive insurance for all your employees but Walmart doesn't?
[00:19:00.024 --> 00:19:03.987]  I mean there's already hardly any five and dimes left that aren't Walmart.
[00:19:04.007 --> 00:19:09.392]  How are you going to compete with Walmart who has lower
[00:19:12.671 --> 00:19:23.734]  standards than anybody else who has deals with the Chinese government to produce goods at a price no one can compete with and now they don't have to have insurance for their employees but you do.
[00:19:25.734 --> 00:19:37.477]  If you're an individual, a company of one and can't afford it, hey don't worry the government will just come seize your bank account but if you're Walmart or Burger King or McDonald's and a hundred and nine other companies
[00:19:38.976 --> 00:19:40.878]  Or 108 other companies, you're A-OK, see?
[00:19:41.759 --> 00:19:43.081]  That's total discrimination.
[00:19:43.701 --> 00:19:45.784]  And it's unfair trade practices.
[00:19:46.144 --> 00:19:47.546]  But the system doesn't care.
[00:19:49.508 --> 00:19:52.251]  See, liberalism isn't liberal.
[00:19:52.731 --> 00:19:54.834]  It's a bunch of bank-robbing crooks.
[00:19:54.874 --> 00:19:55.535]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:58.138 --> 00:20:02.021]  In a coming apart world, you need something to keep it tied together.
[00:20:02.302 --> 00:20:04.023]  That something is Atwood Rope.

[00:20:06.285 --> 00:20:11.889]  From exotic braids for military, rescue, arborists, shipyards, towline, or boating.

[00:20:27.762 --> 00:20:28.843]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:29.023 --> 00:20:33.406]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:33.586 --> 00:20:39.290]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:42.792]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:20:43.032 --> 00:20:45.634]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:45.734 --> 00:20:50.657]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:20:50.797 --> 00:20:51.038]  Call 800-686-2237.

[00:20:57.882 --> 00:20:58.603]  Still worrying?
[00:20:58.884 --> 00:21:03.349]  From GMO to organic food in jeopardy, divided by economic turmoil, there is still an answer.
[00:21:03.629 --> 00:21:07.414]  With just a little knowledge easily acquired, you will literally see food everywhere.
[00:21:07.734 --> 00:21:12.920]  Author Linda Runyon has these skills from having lived this way of life and created the tools so you could too.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:17.886]  Wild food is economical, nutritious, freely available, abundant, and free for the taking.
[00:21:18.226 --> 00:21:21.527]  It is a skill that takes little time to learn, but stays with you for life.
[00:21:21.967 --> 00:21:23.968]  And now for a limited time, it's all on sale.
[00:21:24.208 --> 00:21:26.308]  It's called the Buy Buy Old Website Sale.

[00:21:37.333 --> 00:21:39.576]  This was the only one in 2010 so far.
[00:21:40.056 --> 00:21:44.360]  We've been lucky to keep our prices the same since 2008, but who knows what the future will bring.

[00:21:58.061 --> 00:22:02.206]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[00:22:02.246 --> 00:22:03.507]  dollar has been devaluating.
[00:22:03.687 --> 00:22:07.391]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[00:22:07.671 --> 00:22:10.214]  Is there a way to protect your portfolios from losing value?
[00:22:10.414 --> 00:22:12.216]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[00:22:12.397 --> 00:22:14.539]  They both have maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:24.468]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them until now, your cash would have the buying power of only $4,800.
[00:22:24.748 --> 00:22:27.931]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[00:22:27.991 --> 00:22:31.094]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.

[00:24:03.462 --> 00:24:05.923]  This TSA situation is huge.
[00:24:06.023 --> 00:24:06.544]  It's big.
[00:24:06.564 --> 00:24:09.085]  That's why we've been spending so much time on it.
[00:24:09.125 --> 00:24:11.867]  There's been giant new developments on this front.
[00:24:11.947 --> 00:24:13.108]  It's coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:14.108 --> 00:24:24.094]  But getting back to levels of corruption never before seen, what the globalists are creating is a class system.
[00:24:26.414 --> 00:24:32.121]  Where if you're a government bureaucrat or you're somebody with a national security clearance, you're above the law.
[00:24:32.782 --> 00:24:34.224]  You get to go around the line.
[00:24:34.584 --> 00:24:40.192]  You don't have to have your wife's breast squeezed, your children molested.
[00:24:40.872 --> 00:24:42.515]  But for everybody else you do.
[00:24:44.469 --> 00:25:09.297]  And it's the same thing with President Obama ramming through the health care written by the insurance companies to make 30 plus million Americans buy overpriced insurance and allows the government to set the standards of care of what type of tests and surgeries you will get and admitting that it is a death panel.
[00:25:12.335 --> 00:25:22.799]  I mean, I've been fighting the Globals for 15 years full-time, 17 years since I've really been awake, and I still get amazed by how much they lie.
[00:25:22.819 --> 00:25:25.860]  I mean, there are death panels written right into that thing.
[00:25:26.821 --> 00:25:28.481]  And now, after they pass it, they admit it.
[00:25:29.302 --> 00:25:34.024]  Yeah, we are going to cut what health care somebody gets, and we'll be able to hire more teachers.
[00:25:34.924 --> 00:25:36.885]  So, see, they also get us fighting over the resources.
[00:25:37.645 --> 00:25:38.886]  But it's so illegal.
[00:25:38.986 --> 00:25:40.266]  It's so discriminatory.
[00:25:40.726 --> 00:25:41.947]  It's so unfair.
[00:25:44.824 --> 00:25:59.393]  To have a hundred and eleven major, you know, Fortune 500 companies from McDonald's to Walmart, they don't have to get health insurance for their employees.
[00:26:00.673 --> 00:26:08.378]  And of course all those companies would have done, this is why Obama's giving them the waivers, is lay off a bunch of people and make their employees pay for their own health care.
[00:26:09.218 --> 00:26:09.979]  That's how it works.
[00:26:11.499 --> 00:26:18.625]  See, if you're paid $15 an hour, the company you work for is matching your social security, your workers comp, all of it.
[00:26:18.645 --> 00:26:20.687]  They're probably paying $7 on top of the $15.
[00:26:22.248 --> 00:26:23.729]  You're getting paid $25 an hour.
[00:26:23.749 --> 00:26:24.630]  You're getting paid more like $35 an hour.
[00:26:26.872 --> 00:26:28.933]  Somebody at Wendy's getting paid nine bucks an hour.
[00:26:29.433 --> 00:26:32.333]  Their boss is probably kicking in more like fourteen, fifteen bucks an hour.
[00:26:32.794 --> 00:26:38.695]  This is all the hidden taxes out there, so the dumbed-down public's like, yeah, I want some free health care.
[00:26:38.955 --> 00:26:40.576]  Thank you so much, Mr. President.
[00:26:40.596 --> 00:26:43.196]  I don't have to worry about my car payment or my house anymore.
[00:26:43.216 --> 00:26:48.598]  Remember all those idiots two years ago when he got elected?
[00:26:49.838 --> 00:26:52.839]  A year and a half ago when he got into office?
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.220]  Remember all of that?
[00:26:57.352 --> 00:26:59.133]  Yeah, where's your Valhalla now?
[00:26:59.173 --> 00:27:04.795]  And then they announced, oh, the health care doesn't cover pre-existing conditions in old people and children.
[00:27:05.655 --> 00:27:08.936]  Oh, I'm afraid you've got to go out and buy your own insurance.
[00:27:10.797 --> 00:27:12.197]  Oh, you don't have the money for it?
[00:27:12.258 --> 00:27:12.858]  Don't worry.
[00:27:13.918 --> 00:27:18.640]  You're making $15,000 a year, $16,000 a year, right at the poverty line.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.601]  We're just going to go ahead and grab part of your paycheck.
[00:27:22.421 --> 00:27:24.202]  And now you're going to get Medicare or Medicaid.
[00:27:26.308 --> 00:27:28.869]  What did the British government announce two months ago, and now they're going ahead with it.
[00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:39.516]  All of the paychecks in England, they're reportedly saying, they're trying to phase it in next year, will be deposited digitally with the government, and then it will take out what it wants.
[00:27:40.276 --> 00:27:47.300]  So of course in England and the US, they're trying to ban garage sales, or give people million dollar fines if they don't get a permit.
[00:27:48.181 --> 00:27:49.822]  That's Associated Press if you don't believe me.
[00:27:54.644 --> 00:27:55.665]  I mean, think about that.
[00:27:57.708 --> 00:28:01.691]  All these big mega-corporations, they're all above the law.
[00:28:02.091 --> 00:28:03.933]  They don't have to get anybody insurance.
[00:28:04.413 --> 00:28:10.278]  Now they can cut the prices of their goods, and they can shut down all their competition, because they're the insiders.
[00:28:12.199 --> 00:28:15.502]  It's the same thing with the carbon taxes in Europe, in Spain, and other areas.
[00:28:16.162 --> 00:28:17.183]  And now in California.
[00:28:17.523 --> 00:28:23.588]  If you're an insider, you can have broken sprinkler heads pouring water into the street every day.
[00:28:23.648 --> 00:28:24.729]  You don't get a fine or a fee.
[00:28:26.345 --> 00:28:31.067]  You can have all the carbon dioxide and carbon footprints you want, nothing's going to happen to you.
[00:28:31.487 --> 00:28:35.669]  Oh, but if you're a little local company or a home, you're going to be squeezed.
[00:28:35.709 --> 00:28:36.809]  The bureaucrats are coming.
[00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:44.613]  See, big government's written to keep the little guy from ever climbing out of
[00:28:45.674 --> 00:28:47.315]  Poverty into the middle class.
[00:28:48.295 --> 00:28:54.777]  That's one enemy of the elite, but the biggest enemy is the middle class climbing out of the middle class into new wealth.
[00:28:55.318 --> 00:28:57.218]  Or nouveau riche, as the French call it.
[00:28:58.299 --> 00:28:59.979]  And then into the elite.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.841]  No, no, no.
[00:29:03.141 --> 00:29:04.461]  That's the big no-no.
[00:29:05.081 --> 00:29:06.322]  That's what's really bad.
[00:29:06.782 --> 00:29:07.983]  That's what has to be stopped.
[00:29:08.003 --> 00:29:14.105]  But now, in land of the free, home of the brave, they don't just fondle your wife and children and put them through radiation systems.
[00:29:16.223 --> 00:29:18.184]  They don't just do that now in America.
[00:29:20.526 --> 00:29:20.706]  No.
[00:29:24.489 --> 00:29:32.414]  No, your company that employs 25 people, it's gonna have to, next year, get insurance for everyone there.
[00:29:32.434 --> 00:29:33.715]  See, I'll have to lay off some folks.
[00:29:34.475 --> 00:29:34.916]  So will you.
[00:29:37.315 --> 00:29:38.436]  Cut the other people's pay.
[00:29:39.277 --> 00:29:39.658]  What then?
[00:29:39.678 --> 00:29:41.580]  McDonald's and Walmart?
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:42.381]  No problem!
[00:29:42.441 --> 00:29:43.142]  They don't have to!
[00:29:43.602 --> 00:29:45.324]  That's the ultimate discrimination.
[00:29:45.545 --> 00:29:46.906]  Economic discrimination.
[00:29:47.988 --> 00:29:48.909]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.389 --> 00:29:50.991]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.912 --> 00:29:54.615]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:57.622 --> 00:30:01.845]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:02.165 --> 00:30:02.765]  Number 1.
[00:30:03.086 --> 00:30:06.248]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:06.508 --> 00:30:07.068]  Number 2.
[00:30:07.369 --> 00:30:11.912]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:12.252 --> 00:30:12.712]  It's true.
[00:30:13.012 --> 00:30:17.555]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:17.876 --> 00:30:18.416]  Number 3.
[00:30:18.696 --> 00:30:21.978]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:22.298 --> 00:30:25.981]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:26.181 --> 00:30:26.741]  Number 4.
[00:30:26.981 --> 00:30:29.342]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:29.742 --> 00:30:33.124]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:33.424 --> 00:30:33.624]  Number 5.
[00:30:34.224 --> 00:30:38.126]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:38.366 --> 00:30:43.128]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:43.408 --> 00:30:47.431]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:47.591 --> 00:30:49.152]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:49.372 --> 00:30:51.434]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:30:51.614 --> 00:30:53.956]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:30:57.719 --> 00:31:01.023]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:31:01.304 --> 00:31:02.385]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:31:02.605 --> 00:31:06.791]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:31:07.011 --> 00:31:12.658]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:31:12.959 --> 00:31:14.821]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:31:14.861 --> 00:31:15.321]  I think so.
[00:31:32.148 --> 00:31:37.151]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis and you can't eat paper, stocks or metals.
[00:31:37.451 --> 00:31:42.635]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[00:31:42.815 --> 00:31:45.777]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:31:46.017 --> 00:31:48.959]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:31:49.019 --> 00:31:49.780]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:32:01.215 --> 00:32:02.136]  Tyranny is here.
[00:32:02.476 --> 00:32:05.999]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:32:06.019 --> 00:32:08.622]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:32:08.802 --> 00:32:14.087]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:32:14.507 --> 00:32:20.753]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:32:21.153 --> 00:32:26.697]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:32:27.117 --> 00:32:30.819]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:35.322]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:32:35.622 --> 00:32:41.126]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:32:41.566 --> 00:32:44.728]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:32:45.108 --> 00:32:46.529]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:32:47.089 --> 00:32:47.530]  It's here.
[00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:55.213]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:00.074 --> 00:33:07.817]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:15.908 --> 00:33:24.112]  If you're doubting me, because I know a lot of you do that, you can't believe this stuff's happening, neither can I. Drudge Reports got it linked up there for several days.
[00:33:24.332 --> 00:33:24.432]  U.S.
[00:33:24.452 --> 00:33:32.956]  Department of Health and Human Services approved applications for waiver of annual limits requirements on the section of the health care bill.
[00:33:34.016 --> 00:33:38.038]  And it's got things like Jack in the Box and Cracker Barrel in there.
[00:33:38.458 --> 00:33:40.479]  But this is only one group of waivers.
[00:33:40.499 --> 00:33:44.381]  There's another group of waivers that did get some attention.
[00:33:45.888 --> 00:33:57.259]  What, back on the 7th of October in USA Today, McDonald's 29 other firms get health care coverage waivers.
[00:33:58.119 --> 00:34:06.167]  I mean, how do you give elite companies waivers and then not give the general public waivers?
[00:34:06.627 --> 00:34:10.331]  But Jerram was pointing out that if you read the list of this latest 111 waivers,
[00:34:13.291 --> 00:34:15.413]  I mean, how are they not going to give my operation a waiver?
[00:34:15.993 --> 00:34:17.794]  Most people that work here, they do not want health insurance.
[00:34:20.196 --> 00:34:21.657]  Even if they wanted it, we'd go out and get it.
[00:34:23.158 --> 00:34:25.300]  They've either got their own or don't think they need it right now.
[00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:30.151]  But the issue here is, how do they do this?
[00:34:30.271 --> 00:34:31.371]  How do they get away?
[00:34:31.391 --> 00:34:56.156]  I mean, it came out a year and a half ago when they were taking over Chrysler and GM, and the government was giving them billions of taxpayer money, that the Obama administration went to dealerships, some of them over 80 years old, worth millions of dollars, millions and millions of dollars, healthy, good dealerships, and would take them away from Republican donors or people who've never donated to the Democrats.
[00:34:57.222 --> 00:35:03.752]  And then would give them to Democratic operatives or would let the Democratic operatives keep their dealerships.
[00:35:03.852 --> 00:35:09.200]  I mean, this is a group of naked, thug-like gangsters.
[00:35:10.566 --> 00:35:13.028]  And where are the criminal Republicans?
[00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:19.493]  They should be calling for indictments and impeachments and immediate repeal of this now.
[00:35:20.153 --> 00:35:23.856]  Getting up on their hind legs and saying, look at how outrageous this is!
[00:35:24.297 --> 00:35:25.678]  We have the moral high ground.
[00:35:26.358 --> 00:35:28.400]  It's just like that CNN host we're about to play.
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:31.843]  He looks to John Pistoli, or Pistol,
[00:35:32.623 --> 00:35:36.145]  And says, the head of the TSA, and says, you let pilots fly the planes?
[00:35:36.886 --> 00:35:38.987]  That's a lot more powerful weapon than a bomb or a gun.
[00:35:39.027 --> 00:35:40.668]  Well, why are you naked body scanning them?
[00:35:40.688 --> 00:35:41.429]  Why are you searching them?
[00:35:41.449 --> 00:35:43.830]  He goes, well, these are a special trusted group.
[00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:46.992]  I... Well, yeah, we're all trusted.
[00:35:47.032 --> 00:35:48.814]  We could all just start killing people.
[00:35:49.134 --> 00:35:50.835]  And no amount of security would stop it.
[00:35:52.008 --> 00:35:53.449]  But see, that's the idea.
[00:35:54.089 --> 00:36:05.774]  As the attacks continue at bus stops and malls, the feds have announced they want this same culture of federal goons everywhere, on every street corner, checkpoints.
[00:36:07.028 --> 00:36:08.268]  This is their power grab!
[00:36:08.308 --> 00:36:09.349]  This is their takeover!
[00:36:09.649 --> 00:36:22.173]  And these big defense contractors, they then get the billions of dollars in profits from the face scanning cameras, and the license plate reading cameras, and the data mining software, and the mobile naked body scanners.
[00:36:22.593 --> 00:36:30.296]  And then in every case, where do the cartridge bombs, and the underwear bombs, and the shootings at Fort Hood lead back to?
[00:36:30.636 --> 00:36:33.797]  Directly to the military industrial complex.
[00:36:34.258 --> 00:36:34.878]  Red-handed!
[00:36:35.498 --> 00:36:38.519]  The media comes out and goes, well, yes, the government, U.S.
[00:36:38.559 --> 00:36:43.800]  government, did help get Muttalib, the underwear bomber, on the plane, but we're not going to discuss it.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:52.882]  Yes, it's true, Anwar al-Awlaki hangs out with the CIA and Pentagon, and he's number one in Al-Qaeda, and he's running the attacks.
[00:36:52.982 --> 00:36:53.843]  Give up your rights.
[00:36:54.203 --> 00:36:56.083]  Let's not talk about how he's at the Pentagon.
[00:36:57.463 --> 00:36:59.304]  It's just all in your face!
[00:37:02.563 --> 00:37:06.186]  So, oh, you don't give money to the Democrat crime machine.
[00:37:06.206 --> 00:37:07.608]  We're going to take your car dealership.
[00:37:08.468 --> 00:37:10.110]  We own Chevy now.
[00:37:10.851 --> 00:37:12.132]  We own GM now.
[00:37:13.093 --> 00:37:19.619]  I mean, we need to just rise up verbally and point out you're a bunch of stinking crooks.
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:22.681]  And the rest of the sheep are going to follow.
[00:37:23.544 --> 00:37:25.205]  Again, I'm getting into the TSA right now.
[00:37:25.245 --> 00:37:25.886]  This is so big.
[00:37:25.906 --> 00:37:28.488]  Do you realize history is being made right now?
[00:37:28.588 --> 00:37:30.889]  People are like, some people, most people totally understand.
[00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:39.475]  Some people send me emails or I see comments and they say, they say, why are you covering this so much?
[00:37:39.575 --> 00:37:44.779]  Well, I'm gonna walk through it again and then get into all the latest developments, okay?
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.602]  Because Homeland Security has stated
[00:37:50.247 --> 00:37:57.239]  That everything you see going on in the airport is going to go on at colleges, K-12 public schools,
[00:37:59.554 --> 00:38:13.183]  Highways, malls, sports stadiums, movie theaters, everywhere is going to have federal goons, way outside the 10th Amendment, putting their hands on you and training you to be a slave.
[00:38:13.623 --> 00:38:15.805]  The airports are the beta test.
[00:38:16.265 --> 00:38:18.387]  That is admitted and they're now rolling it out.
[00:38:18.667 --> 00:38:19.007]  Okay?
[00:38:19.287 --> 00:38:23.230]  So if we don't stop them here, we're never going to stop them.
[00:38:24.787 --> 00:38:33.652]  This is also the first big revolt that is non-violent, that is a true strike, where the pilots are saying they're not going to fly.
[00:38:34.712 --> 00:38:36.814]  The flight attendants are saying they're not going to fly.
[00:38:38.054 --> 00:38:40.396]  The citizens are saying they're not going to fly.
[00:38:40.836 --> 00:38:51.322]  And it's hurting the big airlines and the hotels by billions of dollars a month, and that's all these people care about, so they're now going to Napolitano and saying,
[00:38:52.861 --> 00:38:54.644]  Can't you at least let the pilots fly?
[00:38:54.664 --> 00:38:56.827]  You know, we gotta trust them.
[00:38:56.847 --> 00:39:05.039]  And the government today said, yes, we're going to, in the near future, give them some different screening.
[00:39:06.755 --> 00:39:09.157]  And then, of course, they'll come back a year later and try to put it back in place.
[00:39:09.517 --> 00:39:13.501]  They're masters of, you know, take us a mile, we push them back a half mile.
[00:39:13.521 --> 00:39:16.063]  Then they push us two miles, we push them back a mile.
[00:39:16.403 --> 00:39:17.924]  They always want more, more, more.
[00:39:18.225 --> 00:39:19.506]  These are control freaks.
[00:39:19.586 --> 00:39:20.587]  These are perverts.
[00:39:20.967 --> 00:39:22.288]  These are sadists.
[00:39:22.548 --> 00:39:23.809]  That's why they're in government.
[00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:26.251]  They enjoy doing this.
[00:39:26.291 --> 00:39:28.113]  They enjoy power over people.
[00:39:28.874 --> 00:39:31.115]  They enjoy taking over society.
[00:39:31.436 --> 00:39:32.156]  They like it.
[00:39:33.597 --> 00:39:33.878]  Okay?
[00:39:35.134 --> 00:39:39.956]  Now, I want to play this John Pistol clip.
[00:39:40.737 --> 00:39:44.859]  The whole thing is going up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com in minutes.
[00:39:45.319 --> 00:39:51.042]  We've got a big article about Janet Napolitano's lies, and that's coming up in a moment.
[00:39:51.862 --> 00:39:57.325]  But first, let's go ahead and play this major cave-in, this major capitulation.
[00:39:57.585 --> 00:39:58.546]  And you better believe
[00:39:59.383 --> 00:40:02.929]  The TSA controllers, the lobbyists making millions off these machines.
[00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:06.555]  You better believe they're loading up bombs right now.
[00:40:07.714 --> 00:40:09.696]  And it's going to be incredibly obvious.
[00:40:10.196 --> 00:40:13.339]  A lot of mainstream news is already suspecting the government.
[00:40:13.659 --> 00:40:16.502]  Glenn Beck's talking about Oklahoma City being an inside job.
[00:40:16.742 --> 00:40:18.183]  The Democrats may stage more.
[00:40:18.444 --> 00:40:26.631]  Geraldo Saturday night came out and said he wants to look at Building 7 and that there may be something to this and that he was wrong about 9-11 truth.
[00:40:27.131 --> 00:40:27.812]  It's over.
[00:40:28.252 --> 00:40:29.453]  People know.
[00:40:29.974 --> 00:40:31.655]  And you can't control everybody.
[00:40:32.536 --> 00:40:33.417]  It's over, criminals.
[00:40:35.509 --> 00:40:41.953]  And for those of you that have a fetish of hating Muslims, look, it's the government bringing in the Muslims at record levels.
[00:40:42.493 --> 00:40:47.576]  It's the government that says Homeland Security is for gun owners, conservatives, returning veterans, libertarians.
[00:40:48.176 --> 00:40:55.440]  Even if you want to keep sucking your thumb of the Muslim hatred, then at least understand it was a bait-and-switch.
[00:40:56.541 --> 00:40:59.683]  Okay, so for your own little mind, Muslims are evil, okay?
[00:40:59.903 --> 00:41:02.904]  I'm not saying that, but just for your own little world, they're the devil.
[00:41:04.571 --> 00:41:12.673]  The Homeland Security was set up for you, buddy boy, because you got a back 40 and an old farmhouse and know how to plant tomatoes.
[00:41:13.073 --> 00:41:13.973]  They don't like you.
[00:41:14.533 --> 00:41:15.454]  It's set up for you.
[00:41:15.494 --> 00:41:16.194]  You understand that?
[00:41:16.974 --> 00:41:18.774]  Get that through your brain right now.
[00:41:20.075 --> 00:41:25.076]  Let's go ahead and play this clip of the head of the TSA caving in to common sense.
[00:41:25.116 --> 00:41:25.456]  Here it is.
[00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:32.388]  And Sully Sullenberger has fired the latest volley in this, now saying, I don't understand what the purpose of screening pilots is.
[00:41:32.789 --> 00:41:40.594]  And some people at home might ask, you know, the biggest weapon that a pilot could possibly have, if they want, if he or she wanted to commit an act of terror, is in their hands.
[00:41:40.634 --> 00:41:41.375]  It's the aircraft.
[00:41:41.435 --> 00:41:42.976]  So why are we even screening pilots?
[00:41:43.576 --> 00:41:50.377]  Well, that's obviously been an issue for a while, John, and trying to use an intelligence-driven, risk-based approach.
[00:41:50.938 --> 00:41:56.099]  We had some good conversations last week with the pilot groups, and we're continuing that this week.
[00:41:56.459 --> 00:42:05.361]  And I believe we are finding a good way forward on that as we try to manage risk as to the security we need to apply to those groups for those very reasons.
[00:42:05.661 --> 00:42:12.202]  Does it make sense to you to screen a pilot for weapons if, again, they've got the biggest weapon they could possibly have in their hands?
[00:42:12.842 --> 00:42:25.001]  Well, obviously they are a trusted group in so many different ways and so it makes sense to do some type of different type of screening which we will explore and I think have a way forward here in the near future.
[00:42:25.021 --> 00:42:26.944]  So things will change when it comes to pilots, will they?
[00:42:27.665 --> 00:42:35.009]  Well, I don't want to broadcast anything prematurely, but I think there are options that we are looking at that would make sense.
[00:42:35.029 --> 00:42:35.970]  All right, that's very interesting.
[00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:38.531]  Now, what about this fellow over the weekend in San Diego, John Tyner?
[00:42:38.931 --> 00:42:53.880]  Didn't want to go through the body scanning machine, and then when he was subjected to a pat-down, he was uncomfortable with the level of pat-down that he was going to be subject to, and then he was escorted out of the airport and then told that he might face a $10,000 fine.
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.701]  What's your take on that episode?
[00:42:56.923 --> 00:43:01.546]  Well, obviously everybody has their own perspectives about their personal screening.
[00:43:01.646 --> 00:43:07.750]  And again, it gets back to the issue of what are we doing to ensure everybody else on that flight that people have been properly screened.
[00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:16.796]  So if Abdulmutallab from 1225 had said, well, look, I don't want you doing a pat down on me because of my beliefs or whatever it may be.
[00:43:27.363 --> 00:43:32.527]  And that a sharp-dressed man was able to get him on the plane without a passport.
[00:43:32.847 --> 00:43:35.869]  And then it came out it was done through the State Department.
[00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:38.511]  They got him on the plane!
[00:43:38.852 --> 00:43:39.772]  They did it!
[00:43:41.453 --> 00:43:43.995]  They're the ones right out in the open!
[00:43:44.656 --> 00:43:46.317]  Who investigates the TSA?
[00:43:46.577 --> 00:43:51.861]  Who investigates the minimum wage elephant rear-ended
[00:43:53.188 --> 00:43:57.450]  Fat bodies that they've got running around, groping everybody.
[00:44:02.352 --> 00:44:05.953]  I mean, who's going to stop somebody pulling up at an airport with a machine gun just shooting everybody?
[00:44:07.154 --> 00:44:09.135]  Who's going to stop a suicide bomber running into an airport?
[00:44:09.969 --> 00:44:12.192]  Okay, you're going to put a security perimeter around the airport.
[00:44:12.573 --> 00:44:14.035]  What's going to stop them from walking into a 7-Eleven?
[00:44:14.055 --> 00:44:17.119]  Oh, we're going to put federal guards outside of the 7-Eleven?
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:21.305]  What's going to stop somebody from putting an IED out on the highway?
[00:44:21.686 --> 00:44:22.947]  Nothing's going to stop them!
[00:44:23.268 --> 00:44:25.651]  The truth is nobody's doing it but the feds!
[00:44:26.272 --> 00:44:34.580]  And the feds have been training local police for at least five years that there's about to be IEDs detonating in every community and to harden their police departments against the people.
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:35.521]  That's all admitted.
[00:44:35.881 --> 00:44:37.923]  And guess who they tell the cops the bad guys are?
[00:44:38.163 --> 00:44:39.965]  They tell them veterans are gonna bomb you.
[00:44:42.105 --> 00:44:53.573]  No, the Feds are going to bomb local cops to have those weak-minded people go and grovel to the Feds and follow all their orders and become secret police for them in this Stasi takeover.
[00:44:53.933 --> 00:44:56.175]  Aren't you smart enough to get it, cops?
[00:44:56.535 --> 00:44:58.517]  Aren't you smart enough to understand it?
[00:44:59.197 --> 00:45:05.342]  Don't you understand we've got swindling offshore banks, raping the country seven ways to Sunday?
[00:45:06.482 --> 00:45:07.923]  Can't you get that through your head?
[00:45:09.044 --> 00:45:10.005]  Don't you understand it?
[00:45:17.199 --> 00:45:27.584]  Now I want to get into Big Sis' lies, and we're having a detailed report written on this that's set to go up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com in the next few minutes.
[00:45:28.104 --> 00:45:33.746]  And I think this is one of the most important articles we've done, because we're on the offensive.
[00:45:33.826 --> 00:45:39.629]  If they fail here, if despite all their staged terror and everything they're doing, if they fail here,
[00:45:40.742 --> 00:45:45.446]  They're not going to be able to federalize all our communities with the 72 threat fusion centers.
[00:45:46.086 --> 00:45:49.709]  They're not going to be able to take over all of our societies.
[00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:54.713]  People are going to say, well, wait a minute, terrorists could attack anywhere, anytime.
[00:45:55.033 --> 00:45:56.534]  Why are we just doing this in airports?
[00:45:57.014 --> 00:45:58.756]  People are getting the common sense.
[00:46:00.337 --> 00:46:05.801]  So they've got to force it through on us, and they're scared, and they're desperate, and they're having to respond.
[00:46:06.061 --> 00:46:09.264]  There's been a backlash against TSA for nine years.
[00:46:11.155 --> 00:46:14.977]  Tourism is way down from all over the world of the U.S.
[00:46:15.177 --> 00:46:16.238]  and inside the U.S.
[00:46:16.658 --> 00:46:20.139]  It's killing the hotels and theme parks and airlines.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:23.341]  And the feds, we have another article out today, actually don't care.
[00:46:23.601 --> 00:46:25.042]  They want to bankrupt the airlines.
[00:46:25.082 --> 00:46:27.003]  They want to quasi-nationalize them.
[00:46:27.223 --> 00:46:29.424]  They only have two or three carriers that are insiders.
[00:46:29.904 --> 00:46:32.526]  They want to ban non-essential travel.
[00:46:32.706 --> 00:46:33.646]  That's mainstream news.
[00:46:33.946 --> 00:46:34.867]  We have an article up on
[00:46:38.148 --> 00:46:40.189]  PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:46:40.229 --> 00:46:42.331]  Homeland Security trying to shut down air travel.
[00:46:44.673 --> 00:46:45.853]  So we know what they're doing.
[00:46:45.873 --> 00:46:47.595]  We know this is part of Agenda 21.
[00:46:48.695 --> 00:46:51.617]  But I saw this article this morning in USA Today.
[00:46:52.038 --> 00:46:53.479]  Napolitano responding.
[00:46:53.519 --> 00:46:54.640]  See, they're in trouble.
[00:46:56.861 --> 00:46:59.103]  And every word in here is a lie.
[00:47:00.884 --> 00:47:07.749]  And if you get this out to people and point out, regardless of what you think of all this screening, she is lying.
[00:47:10.376 --> 00:47:15.558]  Regardless of what you think of all this screening, she is lying to you.
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:26.023]  And I made a special video today that Rob Due's in there editing to put up on the web dealing with her being caught red-handed lying.
[00:47:26.363 --> 00:47:29.004]  Tell him to pop a tape back in the camera.
[00:47:29.024 --> 00:47:31.866]  During the next break I want to shoot an addendum.
[00:47:33.155 --> 00:47:36.037]  Uh, video, to add on to the video he's putting together.
[00:47:36.638 --> 00:47:38.680]  See, I mean, there's so many lies here that I want to go over.
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:50.549]  It's, it's, again, even if you think your wife being groped is great because you've got a fetish of being scared of men with turbans and all the rest of it, but then the guys with turbans are exempt from being searched, you need to understand she's a liar.
[00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:52.631]  Everything in this article is a lie.
[00:47:53.552 --> 00:47:57.135]  Napolitano, this is written by her, scanners are safe.
[00:48:01.618 --> 00:48:03.020]  Pat Downs discreet.
[00:48:05.262 --> 00:48:07.444]  And then she goes into the terrorist attacks they thwarted.
[00:48:07.865 --> 00:48:09.346]  Actually in every case they were behind it.
[00:48:09.967 --> 00:48:11.889]  The Detroit operation, all the rest of it.
[00:48:12.249 --> 00:48:12.930]  That's on record.
[00:48:13.651 --> 00:48:17.054]  So she tells you about the terror attacks that her bosses ran and how they kept you safe from them.
[00:48:18.956 --> 00:48:20.178]  How they kept you safe from that.
[00:48:22.392 --> 00:48:24.073]  And then she goes on with the other lies.
[00:48:24.434 --> 00:48:25.975]  She says pat-downs are discreet.
[00:48:26.355 --> 00:48:30.238]  Having a man grab your genitals or grab your breast is not discreet.
[00:48:30.639 --> 00:48:37.444]  And everyone's pointed out they do this in the common area with hundreds of people around you and they make women raise their dresses.
[00:48:37.704 --> 00:48:39.406]  They make men take their pants down.
[00:48:39.446 --> 00:48:40.126]  That's on record.
[00:48:40.687 --> 00:48:41.587]  They squeeze you.
[00:48:42.708 --> 00:48:44.149]  There's nothing discreet about it.
[00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:46.591]  So she says scanners are safe.
[00:48:46.772 --> 00:48:47.532]  That's a lie.
[00:48:47.872 --> 00:48:50.535]  Got all these scientists and the federal government and
[00:48:51.328 --> 00:48:54.372]  The Atomic Energy Agency saying it's not safe.
[00:48:54.753 --> 00:48:57.356]  And she says, in the opening line, it's all lies.
[00:48:57.396 --> 00:48:58.658]  See, it's a culture of lies.
[00:48:59.119 --> 00:49:00.260]  There are no death panels.
[00:49:00.661 --> 00:49:02.243]  Now they go, oh, death panels are good.
[00:49:02.263 --> 00:49:06.629]  I did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.
[00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:08.251]  Oh, yes I did.
[00:49:09.372 --> 00:49:11.933]  It's just, they love it.
[00:49:12.034 --> 00:49:13.414]  They love lying.
[00:49:13.474 --> 00:49:14.315]  It's what they do.
[00:49:15.035 --> 00:49:16.836]  And they're counting on you not doing research.
[00:49:17.397 --> 00:49:19.017]  So scanners are safe, that's a lie.
[00:49:19.338 --> 00:49:20.398]  Pat-downs are discreet.
[00:49:20.858 --> 00:49:21.659]  That's the headline.
[00:49:24.821 --> 00:49:27.542]  And the biggest lie here is that they're safe.
[00:49:28.062 --> 00:49:34.106]  She quotes John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.
[00:49:35.672 --> 00:49:36.793]  As saying it's safe.
[00:49:37.293 --> 00:49:40.616]  And the Food and Drug Administration, who approved Aspartame, by the way.
[00:49:42.517 --> 00:49:45.339]  And the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:49.562]  The folks that told you Building 7 didn't fall at freefall speeds, but it did.
[00:49:50.023 --> 00:49:58.829]  But actually, without even looking today, because there's hundreds of agencies and groups saying it's deadly, I happen to have the French news agency here, AFP,
[00:50:01.158 --> 00:50:14.094]  Dr. Michael Love, who runs the x-ray lab at the Department of Biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry at John Hopkins, that's the folks that would know, University School of Medicine told AFP.
[00:50:16.437 --> 00:50:18.440]  He said, we know they're hazardous to your health.
[00:50:23.271 --> 00:50:26.633]  He says, you are risking your life when you go through the machines.
[00:50:27.014 --> 00:50:29.836]  I mean, and I could literally go through hundreds of these.
[00:50:30.216 --> 00:50:36.960]  I mean, even the universities she cites, they go to the physics department, not the radiology department.
[00:50:39.142 --> 00:50:42.024]  It's like, hey, I need somebody to fix my car.
[00:50:42.404 --> 00:50:45.927]  I'm going to go hire a arborist who cuts trees.
[00:50:46.667 --> 00:50:48.308]  Or I need somebody to pull my tooth.
[00:50:49.149 --> 00:50:50.650]  I'm going to go to a homeless man to do it.
[00:50:52.705 --> 00:50:54.726]  I mean, we're going to continue with our lives when we get back.
[00:50:58.149 --> 00:51:01.011]  Off-the-grid remedies can still be grown in your own backyard.

[00:51:57.671 --> 00:52:02.532]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:02.632 --> 00:52:03.412]  What have we got?
[00:52:03.632 --> 00:52:05.753]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:06.093 --> 00:52:06.833]  A republic.
[00:52:07.093 --> 00:52:09.673]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:09.733 --> 00:52:11.654]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:11.994 --> 00:52:13.894]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:14.014 --> 00:52:15.294]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:15.695 --> 00:52:16.815]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:17.015 --> 00:52:17.415]  Children?
[00:52:17.635 --> 00:52:18.415]  Our education?
[00:52:18.755 --> 00:52:19.375]  Our money?
[00:52:19.575 --> 00:52:23.236]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:23.596 --> 00:52:27.261]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:27.321 --> 00:52:28.242]  You are being warned.
[00:52:28.563 --> 00:52:29.404]  We have the facts.
[00:52:29.584 --> 00:52:30.705]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:30.765 --> 00:52:31.647]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:31.667 --> 00:52:32.508]  We have common law.
[00:52:32.548 --> 00:52:34.811]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:35.071 --> 00:52:38.856]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:52:38.956 --> 00:52:43.740]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:45.282]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:52:45.402 --> 00:52:46.242]  Don't tread on me.
[00:52:46.503 --> 00:52:53.369]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.

[00:53:43.769 --> 00:53:43.969]  That's 1-877-886-3653.
[00:53:51.653 --> 00:54:01.355]  So it's discreet to grab your private parts in front of everybody at the airport.
[00:54:17.185 --> 00:54:18.686]  And the scanners are safe!
[00:54:20.066 --> 00:54:29.370]  Doesn't matter if the actual federal boards that deal with radiology say they're very dangerous, and that's in CNN and USA Today.
[00:54:29.791 --> 00:54:41.836]  No, they can just go find NIST, who's their pet scammers, who deal with standards in technology, and have them tell you everything's fine.
[00:54:45.868 --> 00:54:50.450]  She also lies and says these are the same pat-downs we've always been doing.
[00:54:52.571 --> 00:54:54.432]  These are new enhanced pat-downs.
[00:54:54.752 --> 00:54:56.033]  They announced those three weeks ago.
[00:54:56.073 --> 00:54:58.474]  That's what finally drove people over the edge.
[00:54:58.514 --> 00:55:00.535]  Notice they always want more, more, more, more, more.
[00:55:00.895 --> 00:55:06.238]  I guarantee if we didn't say no here, they would start calling for cavity searches.
[00:55:08.649 --> 00:55:11.531]  Because, you know, they're going to have one of their stooges that they bust.
[00:55:11.872 --> 00:55:13.873]  Some drugged up zombie they get on a plane.
[00:55:14.194 --> 00:55:15.755]  They'll even have the government getting them on the plane.
[00:55:15.775 --> 00:55:18.657]  The drugged out zombie might even be in a hospital gown.
[00:55:18.677 --> 00:55:21.340]  I mean, basically, Muttalib was.
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:25.143]  And they get them on and, oh, he had a hand grenade up his rear end.
[00:55:28.926 --> 00:55:30.507]  He had a hand grenade up his rear end.
[00:55:32.709 --> 00:55:35.492]  They have mules that swallow, you know, just tons of heroin.
[00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:36.753]  Rabbits sewed into them.
[00:55:37.824 --> 00:55:46.027]  There's only a matter of time until they do a stunt, and then, sorry, proctology exam, or sorry, we've got to do a chest x-ray.
[00:55:46.247 --> 00:55:47.467]  They're already talking about that.
[00:55:47.867 --> 00:55:49.088]  There's no end to it.
[00:55:50.088 --> 00:55:54.229]  If somebody ever bombs a Baptist church, we're going to have federal armed guards at the Baptist church?
[00:55:55.790 --> 00:56:01.472]  If somebody ever bombs a pizza place, we're going to have checkpoints at all the pizza places?
[00:56:02.759 --> 00:56:04.280]  This is all staged, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:07.422]  So she goes on to say these are the same pat-downs we've always been doing.
[00:56:07.942 --> 00:56:08.422]  Liar!
[00:56:08.782 --> 00:56:10.623]  You are a liar, Napolitano!
[00:56:10.883 --> 00:56:12.444]  There's no end to your lies!
[00:56:13.325 --> 00:56:26.472]  We've got a report coming out on this, and as soon as I have the headline that Steve Watson has gone with, you better believe we're going to make this a search term today, because these search terms, as Max Keiser said Friday,
[00:56:27.958 --> 00:56:31.162]  Are having a huge, huge effect.
[00:56:31.502 --> 00:56:34.466]  Here's one of the headlines, TSA caves on molesting pilots.
[00:56:37.289 --> 00:56:40.713]  That's a key story up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:56:42.315 --> 00:56:43.497]  That is big news.
[00:56:46.288 --> 00:56:53.092]  And we've got Homeland Security trying to shut down air travel that goes through the admissions of the UN and others.
[00:56:53.112 --> 00:56:58.995]  They want to put taxes on airlines and quote, shut down non-essential travel.
[00:57:00.516 --> 00:57:10.522]  But in other developments, hundreds of publications, Forbes, Chicago Tribune, they have headlines like, government in your pants, Chicago Tribune.
[00:57:13.442 --> 00:57:14.183]  Or Forbes?
[00:57:15.203 --> 00:57:16.925]  Abolish the TSA!
[00:57:19.647 --> 00:57:37.960]  And again, if you really believe that Al-Qaeda's real, and we're all lockies hanging out at the Pentagon, but that's no big deal, let's just ignore that, and buildings blow up and fall at free-fall speed, of course there's a Chinese building here in my stack burning today, it's been burning for a long time, nothing's
[00:57:39.284 --> 00:57:40.225]  Nothing's collapsed.
[00:57:40.765 --> 00:57:41.686]  I'll have to cover that later.
[00:57:41.706 --> 00:57:46.969]  I mean, if you really believe all these fairy tales, why don't they just profile Muslims?
[00:57:48.339 --> 00:57:50.921]  Why don't they just profile people with Middle Eastern names?
[00:57:51.862 --> 00:57:53.643]  I mean, the government already knows everything about you.
[00:57:53.664 --> 00:57:54.744]  They're already spying on everything.
[00:57:55.125 --> 00:57:55.465]  They know.
[00:57:55.505 --> 00:57:56.486]  They've got databases.
[00:57:57.106 --> 00:58:01.010]  Every time it's a real terrorist, it turns out they're trained at U.S.
[00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:01.850]  military bases.
[00:58:02.271 --> 00:58:03.372]  They're protected by the U.S.
[00:58:03.412 --> 00:58:03.772]  government.
[00:58:04.192 --> 00:58:05.894]  Their houses are paid for by the government.
[00:58:06.294 --> 00:58:07.775]  They're given visas by the government.
[00:58:08.056 --> 00:58:09.777]  They're helped to get on airplanes by the government.
[00:58:11.218 --> 00:58:12.820]  The government cooks the bombs for them.
[00:58:14.383 --> 00:58:16.905]  The government wants to be your daddy.
[00:58:17.045 --> 00:58:18.346]  It wants to run everything.
[00:58:19.147 --> 00:58:22.129]  It wants the keys to the cupboard so it can control you.
[00:58:22.189 --> 00:58:23.230]  It's very elementary.
[00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:28.393]  They get trillions of dollars tax-exempt a year for the military-industrial complex.
[00:58:30.635 --> 00:58:32.236]  And of course they're staging this stuff.
[00:58:32.657 --> 00:58:34.078]  It's time to grow up and realize that.
[00:58:34.098 --> 00:58:36.459]  We're going to be right back with the Economic News.
[00:58:39.281 --> 00:58:40.983]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:42.762 --> 00:58:44.950]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[00:58:49.588 --> 00:58:53.211]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:58:53.551 --> 00:59:01.677]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:59:02.418 --> 00:59:06.441]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:59:07.041 --> 00:59:17.870]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:27.493]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:59:27.993 --> 00:59:33.035]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:59:33.415 --> 00:59:40.598]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:59:40.898 --> 00:59:43.659]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:59:50.566 --> 00:59:52.507]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:52.967 --> 00:59:55.829]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:02.512 --> 01:00:03.153]  Big Brother.
[01:00:03.813 --> 01:00:04.854]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:05.594 --> 01:00:06.835]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:07.355 --> 01:00:08.175]  You want answers?
[01:00:08.936 --> 01:00:10.837]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:10.857 --> 01:00:14.118]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:14.659 --> 01:00:18.741]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.704 --> 01:00:24.545]  There's a big story that's not getting any attention.
[01:00:26.526 --> 01:00:31.408]  Oh, it's getting attention that all over Texas they found high levels of uranium.
[01:00:35.211 --> 01:00:39.212]  And radium, and they admit it just massively increases cancer.
[01:00:39.873 --> 01:00:51.756]  What they're not telling you in the KHOU, or Associated Press articles, is that the uranium is coming from the chemicals added at the water treatment plants.
[01:00:52.637 --> 01:00:56.078]  They're mined in limestone deposits for phosphates.
[01:00:56.578 --> 01:00:59.279]  It's also the same place you mine for uranium.
[01:01:00.964 --> 01:01:06.686]  We were just talking about this early last week and this broke on Friday about how, look, it's not just sodium fluoride they put in your water.
[01:01:07.226 --> 01:01:09.186]  They call the stuff they put in fluoride.
[01:01:09.246 --> 01:01:21.029]  It's all the toxic waste left over from aluminum manufacturing, smelting, the scrubbers for smokestacks because they can't let that toxic waste go into the air.
[01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:25.611]  So they shoot a sheen of water across and it precipitates into it.
[01:01:26.251 --> 01:01:26.551]  Then they
[01:01:28.587 --> 01:01:29.127]  of course.
[01:01:43.191 --> 01:01:46.394]  If you put uranium and other things and arsenic on plants, it'll kill them.
[01:01:46.694 --> 01:01:48.976]  So they've got to cut most of it out or it'd be too obvious.
[01:01:48.996 --> 01:01:50.458]  And they go, what do we do with it?
[01:01:51.058 --> 01:01:58.605]  We'll go lobby cities and tell them it's good for their teeth and they'll pay us, in the case of Austin, over a million bucks a year to put uranium in the water.
[01:01:58.625 --> 01:02:01.868]  And they go, awesome, oh yeah, let's murder the scum.
[01:02:02.188 --> 01:02:05.431]  We're a bunch of eugenicists, just look at those cowardly people.
[01:02:06.468 --> 01:02:09.470]  Look at how they're obsessed with their football games and everything.
[01:02:09.490 --> 01:02:10.451]  Let's murder them!
[01:02:10.791 --> 01:02:12.952]  Let's go shoot some kids up with syphilis while we're at it.
[01:02:13.192 --> 01:02:26.821]  Hey, let's nerve gas some troops from 1946 through 1987 with Project Shad, killing thousands of our own troops, nerve gassing them in chambers, and then telling their families they died of the flu.
[01:02:27.081 --> 01:02:27.942]  Let's murder!
[01:02:28.562 --> 01:02:31.185]  The cowards will never imagine how psychopathic we are.
[01:02:31.565 --> 01:02:32.586]  Let's steal everything.
[01:02:32.766 --> 01:02:40.374]  Let's pass healthcare, meant to lower the standard of healthcare, and make people buy insurance, and then give waivers to all our inside cronies.
[01:02:40.895 --> 01:02:41.415]  Yeah!
[01:02:41.816 --> 01:02:42.216]  Yeah!
[01:02:42.817 --> 01:02:45.219]  Hey, let's squeeze the genitals of all the cattle.
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:47.902]  Let's make them submit to what we're doing.
[01:02:48.483 --> 01:02:51.506]  Let's devalue their currency and make them pay us while we're doing it.
[01:02:53.271 --> 01:02:54.912]  There's nothing these people won't take.
[01:02:54.932 --> 01:02:56.293]  There's nothing they don't love.
[01:02:56.914 --> 01:02:58.255]  And the best part is the cops.
[01:02:58.835 --> 01:03:04.499]  We give them a little outfit, a little Halloween outfit with some little shiny baubles on it.
[01:03:04.779 --> 01:03:05.840]  We give them a little gun.
[01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:08.202]  And then we turn them loose on the public.
[01:03:08.222 --> 01:03:10.003]  Look at that cop drinking radiation.
[01:03:10.023 --> 01:03:11.244]  Look at him shooting his kid up.
[01:03:11.964 --> 01:03:14.045]  Oh, don't hire cops with over 100 IQ, though.
[01:03:14.065 --> 01:03:15.566]  They get a little too smart and see through it.
[01:03:15.906 --> 01:03:16.987]  Just murder them all!
[01:03:17.007 --> 01:03:17.947]  They'll never see it!
[01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:19.308]  They'll never see us coming!
[01:03:19.508 --> 01:03:20.589]  Let's have a celebration!
[01:03:20.789 --> 01:03:30.434]  Let's have a 100-year celebration of the Federal Reserve's secret meeting that the globalists denied for over 50-plus years it even existed.
[01:03:30.655 --> 01:03:32.756]  And now they have a big celebration two weekends ago.
[01:03:33.817 --> 01:03:35.638]  Big public telecast.
[01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:37.039]  Yeah, we took over.
[01:03:37.079 --> 01:03:38.400]  Yeah, the banks are criminal.
[01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:39.620]  Greenspan even admitted it.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.202]  They're just all up there with pure satisfaction.
[01:03:42.222 --> 01:03:43.662]  There's nothing they can't do.
[01:03:44.143 --> 01:03:45.503]  You want a little radiation?
[01:03:45.924 --> 01:03:46.464]  You got it.
[01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:51.141]  You want some bisphenol A to sterilize your butt and give you cancer?
[01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:55.742]  And make your wife's breasts rot off with early onset of breast cancer?
[01:03:55.782 --> 01:03:56.322]  You got it.
[01:03:56.703 --> 01:03:58.423]  You want death and destruction and hell?
[01:03:58.483 --> 01:03:58.943]  You got it.
[01:03:59.363 --> 01:04:03.004]  After all, America, you put up with 50 million dead babies.
[01:04:03.224 --> 01:04:05.185]  51 dead million aborted, chopped up babies.
[01:04:05.565 --> 01:04:08.366]  So you better believe you're gonna get some uranium in your water.
[01:04:08.906 --> 01:04:11.467]  You better believe you're going to get everything you want.
[01:04:11.507 --> 01:04:14.167]  You better believe they're going to chemtrail you.
[01:04:14.567 --> 01:04:20.628]  You better believe they're going to put GMO in all the food to make everybody sick and cause allergies to be triggered.
[01:04:21.189 --> 01:04:24.229]  You better believe the wages of sin are death.
[01:04:24.809 --> 01:04:36.852]  And this big, rotten, decadent, me, me, me, self-centered society is like a big, rotten, dead horse laying out in the sun for a week with its big, old, fat belly about to pop.
[01:04:37.532 --> 01:04:38.493]  Ever seen a dead animal?
[01:04:39.634 --> 01:04:44.418]  One time I was riding by on a tractor, passed a dead cow, the coyote said, and got to it, been dead about four days.
[01:04:45.198 --> 01:04:50.903]  And its stomach exploded, sounded like a backfire of a car, and sent guts flying all over the place.
[01:04:51.243 --> 01:04:52.564]  That's America right now.
[01:04:52.604 --> 01:04:56.147]  Big, fat, maggot-covered carcass that thinks it's beautiful.
[01:04:56.727 --> 01:04:57.368]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:58.979 --> 01:05:02.601]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:05:03.001 --> 01:05:06.003]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:05:06.243 --> 01:05:11.026]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:05:11.046 --> 01:05:17.289]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:05:17.429 --> 01:05:19.671]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:05:20.211 --> 01:05:20.491]  Tim Geithner?
[01:05:20.511 --> 01:05:20.931]  Bernanke?
[01:05:21.031 --> 01:05:21.651]  They're arsonists!
[01:05:21.691 --> 01:05:22.752]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:05:22.812 --> 01:05:25.212]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:05:39.116 --> 01:05:43.037]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[01:05:43.497 --> 01:05:46.038]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:05:46.378 --> 01:05:55.500]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:05:57.481 --> 01:06:01.724]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:02.045 --> 01:06:02.645]  Number 1.
[01:06:02.945 --> 01:06:06.108]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:06.368 --> 01:06:06.929]  Number 2.
[01:06:07.249 --> 01:06:11.793]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:12.133 --> 01:06:12.573]  It's true.
[01:06:12.873 --> 01:06:17.437]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:17.757 --> 01:06:18.298]  Number 3.
[01:06:18.578 --> 01:06:21.861]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:22.161 --> 01:06:25.864]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:26.064 --> 01:06:26.605]  Number 4.
[01:06:26.845 --> 01:06:29.209]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:29.609 --> 01:06:32.994]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:33.294 --> 01:06:33.515]  Number 5.
[01:06:34.095 --> 01:06:38.001]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:38.241 --> 01:06:43.008]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:06:43.288 --> 01:06:47.312]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:47.452 --> 01:06:49.014]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:49.234 --> 01:06:51.316]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:06:51.496 --> 01:06:53.839]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:06:57.301 --> 01:07:01.262]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:07:01.502 --> 01:07:07.543]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:07:07.903 --> 01:07:15.005]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:07:15.285 --> 01:07:19.886]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:07:20.166 --> 01:07:22.227]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800
[01:07:22.847 --> 01:07:25.291]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:07:39.851 --> 01:07:43.293]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:07:43.753 --> 01:07:55.799]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1 to 2 month soap sampler.
[01:07:56.079 --> 01:07:56.519]  Thank you.
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:05.143]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:05.743 --> 01:08:08.725]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.493 --> 01:08:21.000]  I told you two weeks ago that a big awakening was taking place dealing with the TSA and people being fondled and abused.
[01:08:25.183 --> 01:08:31.507]  Anytime you're a slave, anytime you're a prisoner, humiliating things are done to you to train you to accept it.
[01:08:32.648 --> 01:08:33.488]  To break your will.
[01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:37.291]  The United States has been a great nation.
[01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:42.621]  We haven't been perfect, but we've been the greatest and the freest in history.
[01:08:43.902 --> 01:08:44.922]  But we became decadent.
[01:08:45.802 --> 01:08:46.743]  We became wicked.
[01:08:47.543 --> 01:08:48.803]  And it's time to repent.
[01:08:49.784 --> 01:08:51.785]  It's time to learn to recognize evil.
[01:08:52.485 --> 01:08:57.587]  And that doesn't mean I'm on some high horse, but the atheists in people basically say there are no morals.
[01:08:59.207 --> 01:09:02.369]  I was reading the transcript of George Soros on 60 Minutes in 1998.
[01:09:06.488 --> 01:09:07.709]  Saying, yeah, I helped the Nazis.
[01:09:07.729 --> 01:09:09.571]  Yeah, I went around and took their property.
[01:09:10.131 --> 01:09:13.034]  If I wouldn't have done it, somebody else would have done it, so I have no guilt.
[01:09:13.074 --> 01:09:13.654]  That's a quote.
[01:09:16.356 --> 01:09:21.581]  And they almost see it as moral, the globalists do, that they're doing all these evil things.
[01:09:21.621 --> 01:09:22.562]  They think it's good.
[01:09:23.442 --> 01:09:24.243]  They enjoy it.
[01:09:27.486 --> 01:09:31.328]  And they teach us not to care, not to be involved, not to believe we have any power.
[01:09:31.729 --> 01:09:36.671]  They teach us to be passive so that they can basically have their way with us.
[01:09:39.593 --> 01:09:40.214]  And I'm angry.
[01:09:42.235 --> 01:09:43.215]  I don't want to be a slave.
[01:09:43.936 --> 01:09:46.077]  I don't want to lose my free country.
[01:09:46.157 --> 01:09:48.158]  I don't want to lose a future for my children.
[01:09:48.819 --> 01:09:50.960]  I don't want to lose my private property rights.
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:55.823]  I don't want my money taken away and used for social engineering.
[01:09:56.863 --> 01:09:59.284]  And used for wars and empire and brainwashing.
[01:10:00.265 --> 01:10:05.127]  And I'm standing up and I'm saying no to the jack-booted thugs of the federal government.
[01:10:09.549 --> 01:10:12.871]  Drudge just top-linked our TSA caves on molesting pilots.
[01:10:13.391 --> 01:10:14.132]  Thank you, Drudge.
[01:10:14.172 --> 01:10:15.312]  Man, this is history, folks.
[01:10:16.133 --> 01:10:20.235]  Drudge got a record 9 billion readers.
[01:10:21.312 --> 01:10:22.193]  As of today.
[01:10:22.313 --> 01:10:28.296]  He's already broken his previous record of 7 plus billion in 2009.
[01:10:29.296 --> 01:10:34.019]  He's already hit 9 billion readers this year.
[01:10:37.561 --> 01:10:44.044]  And I think I get a lot with 2 million readers a day and 2 million radio listeners.
[01:10:44.064 --> 01:10:46.245]  Try 365 days divided into 9 billion.
[01:10:47.006 --> 01:10:47.446]  What's that?
[01:10:48.406 --> 01:10:49.487]  How many people a day does he get?
[01:10:52.059 --> 01:10:52.619]  It's amazing.
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:58.682]  So, look, I'll go back to A Bug's Life.
[01:10:58.722 --> 01:11:00.023]  Can we pull up A Bug's Life, guys?
[01:11:00.043 --> 01:11:02.964]  I know you have another video queued up, but I want to pull up A Bug's Life.
[01:11:04.204 --> 01:11:06.866]  And I've been talking about this a lot over the years, but more lately.
[01:11:07.446 --> 01:11:13.629]  Because the grasshopper is there, and they're in this big granary, and there's this giant
[01:11:14.767 --> 01:11:25.917]  Vats, giant containers of grain, and they're all sitting around, fat, and living high on the hog, and the number two grasshopper says, hey boss, why aren't we going back to beat up the ants?
[01:11:27.179 --> 01:11:32.003]  And he said, well, that little one ant stood up to me, and, you know, we got plenty of food, so why go put him in his place?
[01:11:32.564 --> 01:11:35.146]  Because those little ants outnumber us 100 to 1.
[01:11:35.786 --> 01:11:38.449]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life.
[01:11:38.589 --> 01:11:40.451]  Because they make the ants collect them food.
[01:11:43.797 --> 01:11:52.234]  And still the stupid grasshopper doesn't get it, so he throws one grain of wheat at him.
[01:11:54.417 --> 01:11:55.258]  He says, does that hurt?
[01:11:55.478 --> 01:11:56.038]  No, that doesn't hurt.
[01:11:56.478 --> 01:11:56.879]  Does that?
[01:11:57.119 --> 01:11:57.499]  Does that?
[01:11:57.639 --> 01:11:58.019]  Does that?
[01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:04.603]  And he pulls the cord and opens up a huge vat and a giant pile covers up the grasshopper and hurts him.
[01:12:04.944 --> 01:12:06.685]  And he says, now you understand, don't you?
[01:12:07.365 --> 01:12:11.027]  So, they're always thinking, what can we make these schmucks do now?
[01:12:11.948 --> 01:12:13.569]  Let's naked body scan them.
[01:12:13.909 --> 01:12:14.930]  Let's hit them with radiation.
[01:12:16.348 --> 01:12:18.031]  Let's touch their genitals.
[01:12:19.433 --> 01:12:20.795]  Let's put fluoride in their water.
[01:12:20.815 --> 01:12:21.777]  Hell, let's put lithium.
[01:12:21.797 --> 01:12:22.759]  They're now calling for that.
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:24.301]  An anti-psychotic.
[01:12:25.303 --> 01:12:26.926]  Let's turn them into drooling zombies.
[01:12:29.230 --> 01:12:29.771]  Here's the clip.
[01:12:30.759 --> 01:12:32.861]  It was that ant that stood up to me.
[01:12:33.181 --> 01:12:35.243]  Yeah, but we can forget about him.
[01:12:35.283 --> 01:12:37.244]  Yeah, it was just one ant.
[01:12:37.324 --> 01:12:38.145]  Ooh, one ant.
[01:12:38.225 --> 01:12:41.027]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:12:41.367 --> 01:12:42.929]  It's just one ant.
[01:12:43.749 --> 01:12:45.871]  Yeah, but they're puny.
[01:12:46.211 --> 01:12:47.452]  Hmm, puny.
[01:12:48.173 --> 01:12:52.596]  Say, let's pretend this brain is a puny little ant.
[01:12:53.817 --> 01:12:54.378]  Did that hurt?
[01:12:55.338 --> 01:12:55.599]  Nope.
[01:12:56.099 --> 01:12:57.300]  Well, how about this one?
[01:12:58.198 --> 01:12:58.879]  Are you kidding?
[01:12:59.099 --> 01:13:05.162]  How about this?
[01:13:15.128 --> 01:13:20.471]  You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[01:13:21.252 --> 01:13:25.717]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[01:13:26.238 --> 01:13:30.263]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life!
[01:13:31.104 --> 01:13:32.385]  It's not about food.
[01:13:33.086 --> 01:13:35.849]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:38.172]  That's why we're going back!
[01:13:39.594 --> 01:13:41.336]  Does anybody else want to stay?
[01:13:54.096 --> 01:14:18.476]  So there you have it, and Napolitano arrogantly, arrogantly, comes out and gets in your face, gets in my face, and says there's no radiation danger, and even sources a university, John Hopkins Medical Center, that is on record
[01:14:19.855 --> 01:14:24.118]  Their radiology department leading the way saying that this is dangerous.
[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:29.882]  And she sources people that are against her saying it's dangerous.
[01:14:30.822 --> 01:14:32.804]  She says the pat-downs are discreet.
[01:14:33.164 --> 01:14:36.266]  What everyone knows it's done out in public and that they're not discreet.
[01:14:37.327 --> 01:14:41.130]  She says they don't save the images and that the machines can't even save the images.
[01:14:41.890 --> 01:14:47.434]  Over a year ago, we got the manuals and put them on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:14:47.794 --> 01:14:48.655]  They saved them all.
[01:14:49.755 --> 01:14:53.516]  Four months ago, it came out all over the country that they are saving them.
[01:14:53.877 --> 01:14:56.438]  Not just at airports, but at federal courthouses.
[01:14:56.978 --> 01:15:01.319]  One courthouse had over 30,000 images attached to their names.
[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:05.721]  And now, they've come out and announced that, guess what?
[01:15:05.961 --> 01:15:09.263]  We can use the scan as a biometric scan of your body.
[01:15:10.703 --> 01:15:11.223]  Of course!
[01:15:11.263 --> 01:15:13.044]  That's what they're designed for!
[01:15:13.584 --> 01:15:14.945]  I looked up the companies!
[01:15:16.004 --> 01:15:23.929]  They originally tried to sell these as a 360 body scanner to be sold to DMVs instead of thumbprints.
[01:15:27.031 --> 01:15:30.533]  The stinking thing is a body scanner for biometrics.
[01:15:30.834 --> 01:15:33.735]  Everybody's emailing me going, it was in Market Watch last Thursday.
[01:15:33.795 --> 01:15:35.577]  Alex, how do you know this before it comes out?
[01:15:35.957 --> 01:15:38.699]  Because I know how to take the name of the machine and look it up.
[01:15:42.541 --> 01:15:43.522]  I'm not smart.
[01:15:43.582 --> 01:15:45.103]  That's what's frustrating about this.
[01:15:47.321 --> 01:15:49.464]  I'm not that smart, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:51.266 --> 01:15:52.407]  You can figure this out.
[01:15:53.028 --> 01:15:54.249]  I've got these people down.
[01:15:54.289 --> 01:15:55.571]  I know exactly what they're up to.
[01:15:55.911 --> 01:16:03.540]  This entire article by Napolitano is a giant, stinking lie.
[01:16:07.867 --> 01:16:09.027]  That's what she thinks of you.
[01:16:09.587 --> 01:16:10.707]  She thinks you're an idiot.
[01:16:11.308 --> 01:16:11.828]  And you know what?
[01:16:11.868 --> 01:16:13.168]  If you put up with her, you are.
[01:16:13.448 --> 01:16:14.808]  If I put up with her, I'm an idiot.
[01:16:15.268 --> 01:16:15.968]  I'm not an idiot.
[01:16:16.288 --> 01:16:17.809]  I'm not going along with these people anymore.
[01:16:18.129 --> 01:16:19.489]  I recognize tyranny when I see it.
[01:16:20.269 --> 01:16:24.150]  Oh sure, 15 years ago when I got started, people said, I don't see the tyranny.
[01:16:24.410 --> 01:16:24.930]  I could see it.
[01:16:25.770 --> 01:16:26.870]  We were pretty bad off then.
[01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:29.231]  I'd take 15 years ago any day now.
[01:16:31.491 --> 01:16:37.052]  15 years ago, the federal government wouldn't think of giving hundreds and hundreds of waivers
[01:16:38.277 --> 01:16:42.760]  To big mega-corporations to not have to get health insurance for their employees, but everybody else does.
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:44.781]  Pure discrimination.
[01:16:46.162 --> 01:16:46.763]  Out in the open!
[01:16:48.424 --> 01:16:50.986]  And not just discrimination, unfair trade advantage.
[01:16:52.627 --> 01:16:56.510]  How is your company going to compete when you've got to get everybody insurance, but they don't?
[01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:58.451]  It's the same thing with NAFTA and GATT.
[01:16:58.731 --> 01:17:00.172]  Same thing with the World Trade Organization.
[01:17:00.512 --> 01:17:01.413]  Same thing with China.
[01:17:04.881 --> 01:17:10.005]  Now we have two very important guests coming up, and we will have open phones later.
[01:17:11.206 --> 01:17:15.729]  And I am going to do some shows this week where we do nothing but phone calls, because I want to hear from all of you on this.
[01:17:17.070 --> 01:17:23.555]  But we are in the middle of a revolution, a peaceful revolution of noncompliance, as Mahatma Gandhi talked about.
[01:17:26.597 --> 01:17:32.262]  More importantly, Jesus Christ was nonviolent, but he led by example and showed up the tyrants
[01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:41.675]  And the power of just saying no, the power of saying no to the globalists is unstoppable.
[01:17:43.296 --> 01:17:44.938]  And they know you're learning that right now.
[01:17:45.038 --> 01:17:50.442]  And you look at Napolitano, you look at John Pistol, the head of the TSA, they're scared.
[01:17:51.683 --> 01:17:58.648]  They knew five years ago when they started really roughing up and grabbing the pilots that it was asinine.
[01:17:58.968 --> 01:18:01.910]  But no one in mainstream media would say, this is ridiculous.
[01:18:02.291 --> 01:18:03.872]  Why do you trust a pilot with a plane
[01:18:05.089 --> 01:18:08.932]  See, we have to come out and ask the common sense questions.
[01:18:09.833 --> 01:18:13.036]  We have to come out and say no.
[01:18:13.676 --> 01:18:15.718]  The truth is, everybody's known this is a joke.
[01:18:17.139 --> 01:18:23.304]  They have a Reuters poll where 97% of respondents say they won't fly because of this.
[01:18:25.726 --> 01:18:28.869]  We can bring the globalists to their knees if we get active now.
[01:18:29.269 --> 01:18:33.713]  If they get their total control grid in place, it's going to be very, very hard.
[01:18:35.182 --> 01:18:38.925]  But right now, we can beat these people by totally discrediting them.
[01:18:39.505 --> 01:18:44.629]  By the way, Jesse Ventura's show Friday night was the most powerful TV program I've ever seen.
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:46.561]  With this type of information.
[01:18:47.301 --> 01:18:51.645]  They admitted the Fusion Centers, the Governor's Council, how FEMA's in full control.
[01:18:52.506 --> 01:18:55.768]  Ventura talks about how all this is documented, it's hidden in plain view.
[01:18:57.370 --> 01:19:03.355]  How the Fusion Centers are tracking political dissidence for Roundup under Rex 84.
[01:19:03.955 --> 01:19:06.797]  And in an hour-long program, it was just amazing.
[01:19:07.138 --> 01:19:09.500]  We have it linked on YouTube up at
[01:19:11.027 --> 01:19:12.368]  Up at InfoWars.com.
[01:19:12.828 --> 01:19:15.469]  It's in the featured news area and on the tiles.
[01:19:15.489 --> 01:19:18.171]  So you can find it there.
[01:19:18.811 --> 01:19:21.653]  It's also going to re-air this Friday, 8 p.m.
[01:19:21.713 --> 01:19:24.254]  Central to 9 p.m.
[01:19:24.294 --> 01:19:27.136]  Central, ahead of the new episode that airs at 9 p.m.
[01:19:27.796 --> 01:19:28.136]  Central.
[01:19:28.756 --> 01:19:30.677]  And it's the JFK special.
[01:19:30.697 --> 01:19:34.780]  But I want to come back and play just a short segment from
[01:19:36.368 --> 01:19:40.970]  Jesse Ventura's television show, the Police State episode that aired Friday.
[01:19:41.490 --> 01:19:43.310]  No wonder they're so proud of this production.
[01:19:43.710 --> 01:19:50.673]  And I'm very proud that I was really the main consultant and gave them a lot of the material and video used in the piece.
[01:19:50.713 --> 01:19:54.774]  It really feels good to be involved with something that was done this accurate and this powerful.
[01:19:54.794 --> 01:19:56.555]  We're going to come back and play a key clip from it.
[01:19:56.575 --> 01:19:56.915]  Stay with us.

[01:20:57.139 --> 01:21:00.422]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:21:01.223 --> 01:21:05.447]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:21:05.727 --> 01:21:11.653]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:21:11.893 --> 01:21:14.035]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:21:14.315 --> 01:21:20.281]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:21:20.401 --> 01:21:23.745]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:21:23.805 --> 01:21:25.508]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:21:25.688 --> 01:21:27.731]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:21:27.871 --> 01:21:32.537]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.

[01:21:37.844 --> 01:21:42.627]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.

[01:21:56.986 --> 01:22:01.107]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[01:22:01.167 --> 01:22:02.428]  dollar has been devaluating.
[01:22:02.588 --> 01:22:06.309]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[01:22:06.589 --> 01:22:09.129]  Is there a way to protect your portfolios from losing value?
[01:22:09.330 --> 01:22:11.130]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[01:22:11.310 --> 01:22:13.631]  They both have maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[01:22:14.651 --> 01:22:23.376]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them until now, your cash would have the buying power of only $4,800.
[01:22:23.656 --> 01:22:26.857]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[01:22:26.917 --> 01:22:29.999]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[01:22:30.219 --> 01:22:32.040]  Call John Ballman today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.

[01:22:38.845 --> 01:22:39.425]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[01:22:56.749 --> 01:22:57.532]  Pure water.
[01:22:57.833 --> 01:23:00.323]  What could be better than the gift of health for your loved ones?
[01:23:00.564 --> 01:23:01.749]  And who better to help you give the
[01:23:08.874 --> 01:23:09.814]  We're good to go!
[01:23:38.387 --> 01:23:40.027]  All the leaves are brown And the sky is gray
[01:24:08.104 --> 01:24:10.907]  That was maybe the scariest discovery we made yet.
[01:24:12.008 --> 01:24:13.169]  Nobody's at the rudder.
[01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:18.154]  These fusion centers are running wild all over our rights.
[01:24:19.295 --> 01:24:20.116]  That's peculiar.
[01:24:20.136 --> 01:24:24.481]  You mean they just give away the money and from that point on they say you're on your own?
[01:24:24.641 --> 01:24:26.923]  Well, uh, it's... Give away the money.
[01:24:27.023 --> 01:24:27.504]  Right, yeah.
[01:24:29.193 --> 01:24:29.813]  Imagine.
[01:24:30.253 --> 01:24:31.914]  Dozens of fusion centers.
[01:24:32.534 --> 01:24:35.154]  Dozens of mini-dictators you never heard of.
[01:24:35.735 --> 01:24:40.756]  A secret government funded by elite power brokers in the top echelon of Washington.
[01:24:41.676 --> 01:24:43.276]  What's the real scheme here?
[01:24:44.057 --> 01:24:46.957]  I got an idea when I got a call from Austin, Texas.
[01:24:48.057 --> 01:24:51.058]  It was Alex Jones, my conspiracy insider.
[01:24:52.358 --> 01:24:54.159]  He knew that June was in town.
[01:24:55.359 --> 01:24:58.540]  And when he heard the term fusion center, he went ballistic.
[01:24:59.813 --> 01:25:01.194]  Governor, I need to talk to you right away.
[01:25:01.214 --> 01:25:02.975]  That's just the tip of the iceberg.
[01:25:03.495 --> 01:25:07.457]  These fusion centers aren't just to keep tabs on the public and spy on us.
[01:25:07.837 --> 01:25:13.099]  They're really command and control centers for the concentration camps that are being expanded all over the nation.
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:15.381]  Concentration camps?
[01:25:16.201 --> 01:25:20.003]  I knew this was going to get bigger, but I had to see this for myself.
[01:25:21.269 --> 01:25:23.950]  I met Alex outside a federal prison in Texas.
[01:25:24.630 --> 01:25:26.891]  At least, it seemed to be a prison.
[01:25:26.911 --> 01:25:36.194]  This is also designated as a civil unrest center and there's 11,000 plus acres in this area controlled by the Department of Defense.
[01:25:36.314 --> 01:25:40.576]  So there's much more potential prison space than what we're seeing right here.
[01:25:41.276 --> 01:25:52.365]  Yes, this is one of the major complexes in the United States for suppressing the major cities during unrest with a financial collapse, or during a war, or during a revolution in this country.
[01:25:52.585 --> 01:25:55.528]  Looks like they're waiting to put us all behind bars.
[01:25:57.169 --> 01:26:02.634]  Coming up, Jesse exposes prison camps across America, waiting for you and me.
[01:26:03.894 --> 01:26:09.739]  They would build them all over the nation, prisons that are for entire families, similar to the Nazi concentration camps.
[01:26:10.439 --> 01:26:14.082]  Then, police swoop in when the team gets too close to the truth.
[01:26:14.102 --> 01:26:16.924]  Governor Jesse Ventura, is there a problem?
[01:26:18.185 --> 01:26:22.088]  And later, Jesse confronts the congressman behind the U.S.
[01:26:22.168 --> 01:26:23.249]  concentration camps.
[01:26:24.150 --> 01:26:27.332]  So none of these, there are no such camps anywhere in America?
[01:26:27.492 --> 01:26:28.053]  No, there aren't.
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:44.784]  Jesse Ventura's investigation of a police state conspiracy began with a look at government terror response bases called fusion centers.
[01:26:48.166 --> 01:26:50.367]  The case has now taken a frightening twist.
[01:26:54.529 --> 01:27:05.294]  Conspiracy expert Alex Jones has warned the governor that fusion centers are actually command centers for a network of concentration camps ready to be activated under martial law.
[01:27:08.829 --> 01:27:15.174]  That they plan to use the cover story that these centers were for illegal aliens or undocumented immigrants.
[01:27:15.474 --> 01:27:22.259]  But that they would then build them all over the nation, prisons that are for entire families, similar to the Nazi concentration camps.
[01:27:22.619 --> 01:27:26.722]  Or similar to when they interned American Japanese citizens in World War II.
[01:27:27.262 --> 01:27:27.623]  Exactly.
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:39.927]  That government plan to suspend the Constitution, declare martial law, and round up anyone deemed a national security threat, it's documented.
[01:27:40.427 --> 01:27:41.568]  It's called Rex 84.
[01:27:42.829 --> 01:27:47.472]  It was cooked up under the Reagan administration by Colonel Oliver North.
[01:27:47.532 --> 01:27:50.094]  Nothing but the truth, so help you God, I do.
[01:27:52.195 --> 01:27:56.438]  June was in Las Vegas with a constitutional expert named Stuart Rhodes.
[01:27:57.401 --> 01:28:04.126]  From Honest Abe to Barack Obama, he says presidents have been taking away our rights whenever they want.
[01:28:06.247 --> 01:28:16.274]  Executive orders over the years give the president the claimed authority to do all kinds of extraordinary things, like round up Americans and intern them without due process.
[01:28:18.908 --> 01:28:20.989]  Should we go through some of these executive orders?
[01:28:21.609 --> 01:28:21.789]  Sure.
[01:28:21.809 --> 01:28:24.329]  Well, I think the first big one was Lincoln during the Civil War.
[01:28:24.689 --> 01:28:30.511]  He ordered embargoes and blockades of southern ports on his own and suspended habeas corpus.
[01:28:30.771 --> 01:28:39.193]  A lot of them don't realize that FDR, by executive order, ordered the detention of American citizens.
[01:28:39.213 --> 01:28:42.334]  They were American citizens, but they happened to be of Japanese descent.
[01:28:42.354 --> 01:28:45.515]  They were corralled up over 100,000 and were interned for years.
[01:28:45.995 --> 01:28:46.955]  No due process at all.
[01:28:48.973 --> 01:28:52.976]  A lot of them date back from the Cold War, signed by Kennedy.
[01:28:52.996 --> 01:28:55.918]  Duck and cover in the school bus.
[01:28:57.499 --> 01:29:06.205]  But the more recent one, which has raised a few eyebrows, is the one issued January 11th, 2010, which is called, which establishes the Council of Governors.
[01:29:09.389 --> 01:29:10.610]  The Council of Governors.
[01:29:11.251 --> 01:29:13.874]  Nine state governors and one from Puerto Rico.
[01:29:14.495 --> 01:29:24.065]  In case of a national emergency, they quarantine the country into ten sectors and take control from the rest of the governors and state legislatures.
[01:29:25.446 --> 01:29:33.289]  If the president wanted to send in military or round-up dissidents in a state, his council of cronies would rubber-stamp anything.
[01:29:33.929 --> 01:29:35.490]  That's why they got picked.
[01:29:36.650 --> 01:29:43.973]  That's the problem, is that the executive branch is now claiming the ability to use its military authority to execute the laws here at home.
[01:29:47.995 --> 01:29:48.895]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.375 --> 01:29:50.896]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.906 --> 01:29:54.688]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:57.871 --> 01:30:01.694]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[01:30:57.617 --> 01:31:00.919]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:31:01.199 --> 01:31:02.260]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:06.683]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:31:06.883 --> 01:31:12.527]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:31:12.827 --> 01:31:14.828]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:31:14.988 --> 01:31:17.730]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.

[01:32:04.028 --> 01:32:08.810]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:32:09.170 --> 01:32:15.953]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:32:17.894 --> 01:32:20.194]  They sew pride in every stitch.

[01:32:26.397 --> 01:32:30.278]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:32:30.979 --> 01:32:35.640]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:37.921]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:32:38.181 --> 01:32:39.702]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[01:32:52.186 --> 01:32:55.427]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it, others don't.
[01:33:08.379 --> 01:33:16.401]  There's a man going around taking names and he decides who to free and who to blame.
[01:33:18.742 --> 01:33:21.583]  Everybody won't be treated all the same.
[01:33:23.404 --> 01:33:31.406]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down when the man comes around.
[01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:41.102]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:44.364 --> 01:33:45.945]  Last week, we played the clip.
[01:33:45.985 --> 01:33:57.992]  Glenn Beck has now come out and said that the government may stage an Oklahoma City bombing to be blamed on the Patriot Tea Party movement in this country.
[01:33:58.992 --> 01:34:00.673]  Michael Savage has said the same thing.
[01:34:01.794 --> 01:34:03.495]  We know the Gulf of Tonkin was staged.
[01:34:09.284 --> 01:34:14.406]  We know there have been countless other staged events throughout history.
[01:34:16.467 --> 01:34:22.349]  We know that Muttalib, the underwear bomber, was brought on the plane, was protected under U.S.
[01:34:22.369 --> 01:34:23.969]  government orders in Amsterdam.
[01:34:25.330 --> 01:34:28.431]  We told you that two months before it was mainstream news.
[01:34:29.692 --> 01:34:31.192]  Because we had eyewitnesses on the plane.
[01:34:33.093 --> 01:34:34.433]  Kurt Haskell and others, the attorney.
[01:34:37.586 --> 01:34:49.710]  I go on big conservative talk shows and I go, look, Fox News reports, Anwar al-Awlaki, the head of al-Qaeda, now the number one, they say, under bin Laden, he hangs out at the Pentagon secretly.
[01:34:50.130 --> 01:34:52.471]  And I bring this up to them and they just don't hear me.
[01:34:52.931 --> 01:34:55.412]  They just move on and go, the Muslim threat, the Muslim threat.
[01:34:55.732 --> 01:34:59.193]  Look, I'm not saying there aren't some Muslims in the Middle East that blow themselves up.
[01:35:00.133 --> 01:35:02.994]  I'm not saying that there isn't some real terrorist out there.
[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:10.865]  The issue is, every one of these big events used to set up a police state has stage written all over it.
[01:35:11.585 --> 01:35:31.822]  Now, I saw a video last night, we played a clip of it, of Geraldo Rivera coming out and having Bob McElveen, who lost his son on 9-11, and an engineer, with Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth, talking about the impossibility of Building 7 and the freefall collapse.
[01:35:33.168 --> 01:35:36.631]  Without even getting into the newscast where they reported the government blew it up.
[01:35:37.172 --> 01:35:43.137]  Though they did play the clip of Larry Silverstein saying they gave the order to pull it and watch the building collapse.
[01:35:43.618 --> 01:35:44.779]  That's now on Fox News.
[01:35:44.839 --> 01:35:52.406]  And Geraldo, that cue up to the last 30 seconds of Geraldo or so, just the part where he goes, wow, I really see where you're coming from now.
[01:35:52.906 --> 01:35:54.107]  Now I have a different view on this.
[01:35:54.187 --> 01:35:56.129]  Wow, this needs to be looked into.
[01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:58.792]  There's no way a real person
[01:35:59.892 --> 01:36:27.234]  can look at 9-11 and not question it but regardless James Gourley uh... is of course an attorney and uh... he is the executive director of international center for 9-11 studies he has an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering as well and it's IC911studies.org the international center for 9-11 studies these are the people the great patriots who deserve your support
[01:36:28.015 --> 01:36:42.671]  Lovers of the truth, who did the FOIA request and filed the lawsuits and went all the rigmarole in the last few years to force the release of all these NIST videos, the federal government videos of firefighters, police and others that they had tried to classify.
[01:36:43.252 --> 01:36:48.858]  Now when they got five terabytes of video and documents released, it wasn't bland stuff.
[01:36:50.859 --> 01:37:01.229]  It was firemen and police and the deputy FBI director talking about bombs and explosions and countdowns and the sounds of bombs and powerful stuff.
[01:37:01.289 --> 01:37:09.858]  So I also want to hear as they go through these five terabytes what else they're about to release, what their organization stands for, and the incredible success they're having.
[01:37:10.499 --> 01:37:12.320]  James Gourley, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:37:13.241 --> 01:37:13.702]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:37:15.658 --> 01:37:24.845]  Tell us about yourself, your organization, correct anything that I might have been partially incorrect on, and break down how you got all this NIST information.
[01:37:26.126 --> 01:37:37.775]  Well, I mean, like you say, I'm an attorney, and that takes most of my time during the day, so I don't have a whole lot of spare time to devote to 9-11.
[01:37:37.816 --> 01:37:43.720]  But I have been trying to contribute some original research and original work since about maybe 2006.
[01:37:45.585 --> 01:38:02.949]  And as I was, you know, submitting comments on various government reports and, you know, submitting papers to be published in scientific journals on this subject, they kept wanting to know, you know, what organization that I was affiliated with.
[01:38:03.289 --> 01:38:07.930]  And since I was, you know, kind of acting independently and I didn't really have anything to say.
[01:38:09.576 --> 01:38:30.481]  In 2008, I founded the International Center for 9-11 Studies basically as a, just a vehicle through which I could, you know, contribute original research to 9-11 and also collaborate, you know, with other scientists and, you know, college professors on work related to 9-11.
[01:38:30.941 --> 01:38:37.282]  So, you know, I've got, you know, I've been author, co-author on
[01:38:38.248 --> 01:38:38.849]  We're good to go.
[01:38:52.577 --> 01:39:04.423]  But the most recent action we've taken was we filed a Freedom of Information Act request in January of 2009 with the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
[01:39:04.944 --> 01:39:19.291]  We basically just requested every photograph or video that they used, you know, received, cited, you know, in any way that was in any way a part of their investigation into the Twin Towers and Building 7.
[01:39:21.963 --> 01:39:37.751]  Uh, they, you know, despite, you know, repeated, uh, you know, requests for, for when we might hear back from them after, you know, four months of calling them about once a month and, and seeing, asking when they might respond, we were forced to file a lawsuit against them.
[01:39:38.191 --> 01:39:43.674]  And, uh, sure enough, you know, a month after we filed the lawsuit, they start releasing documents and they have been ever since.
[01:39:46.701 --> 01:39:50.064]  Well, talk about... I mean, because you really did something important.
[01:39:50.124 --> 01:39:54.428]  Talk about how you got the idea to demand all these videos be released.
[01:39:55.288 --> 01:40:02.714]  They didn't want to be forthcoming, they refused to give them to others, but you were able to get them, and now some of the things that we're seeing on these videos.
[01:40:02.775 --> 01:40:07.358]  It becomes very clear why NIST did not want to release these.
[01:40:08.079 --> 01:40:09.200]  Right, yeah.
[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:14.885]  I think, you know, a year or two before I submitted my request, I recall somebody else
[01:40:15.809 --> 01:40:27.539]  Uh, posting on 9-11 Blogger, uh, that they had requested pretty much the same thing I did and that NIST told them that it would cost, you know, $19,000 or $20,000, uh, to produce all this stuff.
[01:40:27.619 --> 01:40:32.383]  And, and obviously, you know, that was an effort on their part to make it cost prohibitive.
[01:40:32.504 --> 01:40:38.309]  So, you know, I thought, well, I'll submit it and, uh, I'll, I'll submit the same request.
[01:40:38.409 --> 01:40:42.132]  If they try to pull that on me, I'll just, I'll challenge it and I'll just sue them.
[01:40:43.035 --> 01:40:50.942]  Uh, because, you know, I'm an attorney, so, uh, filing a lawsuit against him would be a lot cheaper than, you know, paying him $19,000 or $20,000.
[01:40:51.022 --> 01:41:00.710]  So, um, you know, but after actually, whenever I submitted the request, they never responded, um, which actually under
[01:41:01.337 --> 01:41:10.939]  Under recent amendments to the Freedom of Information Act, if they fail to respond within 20 days, you actually get kicked down into a lower fee structure.
[01:41:10.979 --> 01:41:12.099]  It's kind of complex.
[01:41:12.579 --> 01:41:16.060]  They have three different fee classes that you can fall under.
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:23.281]  So even if they put me in the highest fee class, if they fail to respond, I automatically got kicked down to the next lower fee class.
[01:41:23.321 --> 01:41:28.062]  But actually, since I sued them, they haven't tried to charge me a dime.
[01:41:30.794 --> 01:41:50.559]  It's been pretty successful and like you say as I've been going through these and I've only like and you kind of mentioned there's four or five terabytes of information here and as I've been going through them I've only gotten through maybe 15 to 20 percent of what I've received because it's just a mountain of information but you know you find
[01:41:51.289 --> 01:42:09.239]  All kinds of references to explosions, you know, I wanted to make sure that the, uh, that footage that I think, you know, you've played and others have played about with the, uh, the men walking away from Building 7 with the hard hats on saying, keep an eye on that building, that building's about to blow up.
[01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:18.605]  I wanted to make sure that was legitimate and, you know, sourced from an official government body that documented that they had possession of that video as well.
[01:42:19.581 --> 01:42:31.825]  Um, you know, you've got Brian Williams talking to the fire chief saying, well, you know, we had heard that it was either going to be brought down or would come down on its own, you know?
[01:42:32.405 --> 01:42:38.447]  I mean, NIST was in possession of all kinds of evidence of explosions and ignored it all.
[01:42:40.127 --> 01:42:42.868]  Well, we had the news reporting that they were going to blow up Building 7.
[01:42:43.208 --> 01:42:46.029]  I heard it on the radio that day and now it's all admitted.
[01:42:46.089 --> 01:42:47.650]  So they did this in plain view.
[01:42:49.332 --> 01:42:56.458]  Like a magician distracting you with his assistant while he does the sleight of hand, but we've now seen it.
[01:42:57.159 --> 01:43:01.142]  I don't know if you've seen the latest video, but Geraldo Rivera on Fox.
[01:43:01.162 --> 01:43:02.003]  This is a big deal.
[01:43:03.325 --> 01:43:09.687]  Has come out and tacitly endorsed 9-11 truth and the victims' families over Building 7.
[01:43:10.147 --> 01:43:15.868]  He said he's very concerned about this and understands why people are investigating now.
[01:43:16.408 --> 01:43:22.570]  So it's gone from total ridicule to Geraldo Rivera, a longtime New Yorker, saying he's concerned.
[01:43:23.629 --> 01:43:25.830]  Yeah, I actually did see that this weekend.
[01:43:26.070 --> 01:43:36.354]  All the thanks to that goes to the people who organized the Building What advertising campaign, because I don't think that ever would have happened without Building What.
[01:43:36.874 --> 01:43:47.339]  And actually, a lot of the video that I've received is basically in its very native, very high-quality format, and I gave
[01:43:48.027 --> 01:44:14.862]  The videographer, or the video editor, who put together that commercial, I gave him access to all of the Building 7 collapse videos that I've received, that I know of anyways, that I've discovered, you know, through my investigation, and I think he might have used some of my, you know, the video that I've received in that commercial, because obviously it's going to be broadcast on television, and you need very high quality video for it.
[01:44:14.922 --> 01:44:15.262]  Absolutely.
[01:44:15.382 --> 01:44:24.266]  Well, we want to thank you, James Gorley, for what you've done with your organization that's having a huge effect, International Center for 9-11 Studies.
[01:44:24.946 --> 01:44:30.849]  But I want to expand on that and thank our listeners, because they had raised just a little bit of money.
[01:44:30.869 --> 01:44:33.010]  I'm not thanking myself or the show.
[01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:40.734]  I want to thank our listeners, who I know gave a lot of money when we premiered the Building What commercial here a few months ago.
[01:44:42.375 --> 01:44:48.940]  Gave the largest donations at that point that they had gotten and allowed that TV ad to get on the air.
[01:44:49.300 --> 01:44:51.042]  You've done it again, InfoWarriors.
[01:44:51.542 --> 01:44:53.644]  Now it's getting attention all over New York.
[01:44:53.664 --> 01:44:55.985]  It's getting attention on CNN, Fox.
[01:44:57.205 --> 01:45:00.326]  You name it, and people are having a debate about building 7.
[01:45:00.526 --> 01:45:08.309]  And it all started because the judge, when they were trying to get a city council investigation with their petition, said, building what?
[01:45:08.789 --> 01:45:09.989]  When they were bringing up 7.
[01:45:10.369 --> 01:45:21.093]  And so the genie's out of the bottle, the cat's out of the bag, the train's left the station, and 9-11 Truth is only building its energy internationally, and more and more people
[01:45:21.873 --> 01:45:27.598]  Are looking at the evidence and that's got to feel good, James, for somebody like yourself who's seeking after justice.
[01:45:27.638 --> 01:45:35.124]  You could have just sat there on the sidelines as a successful lawyer and as somebody who's also a chemical engineer.
[01:45:35.664 --> 01:45:37.766]  Why did you get involved?
[01:45:38.854 --> 01:45:42.616]  Well, I mean, how can you not?
[01:45:42.956 --> 01:45:43.457]  I don't know.
[01:45:43.537 --> 01:45:47.399]  I mean, that's basically what it comes down to.
[01:45:47.419 --> 01:46:03.628]  I mean, once I, you know, I first got into this during law school in maybe 2004 when I saw David Ray Griffin giving a talk at the University of Wisconsin in Madison on C-SPAN.
[01:46:04.308 --> 01:46:07.230]  And I mean, after, you know, it probably took me a year
[01:46:08.143 --> 01:46:08.603]  We're good to go.
[01:46:27.958 --> 01:46:31.541]  I had to start contributing in whichever ways I can.
[01:46:32.981 --> 01:46:39.666]  My science background, I've got a degree in chemical engineering, so I'm able to contribute to some of the scientific aspects of it.
[01:46:39.826 --> 01:46:51.614]  Also, I'm an attorney, so I'm able to do things like sue NIST whenever they ignore FOIA requests or if they had tried to assess some kind of
[01:46:53.874 --> 01:46:54.495]  You know what I mean?
[01:47:12.871 --> 01:47:32.648]  There's also evidence in some of the videos of them editing things, like in one Building 7 collapse footage I've seen, it cuts in after the penthouse has already collapsed, and that's very important because they claim that the collapse started somewhere else, but that video that was already open source shows that it began with the penthouse.
[01:47:33.709 --> 01:47:36.251]  Yeah, yeah, they released
[01:47:37.409 --> 01:47:49.079]  Like, all the World Trade Center 7 collapse videos that they've sent me that I've found so far that have good sound and are from close up to Building 7 have... I don't know.
[01:47:49.099 --> 01:47:59.908]  I mean, it's suspicious whether they might have cut out the collapse of the penthouse or what, but the collapse of the east penthouse is missing in all the really good video.
[01:48:00.308 --> 01:48:01.009]  And actually, one of
[01:48:02.140 --> 01:48:10.185]  One of the videos that does show the collapse of the East Penthouse, actually the soundtrack is missing until after the collapse is already over.
[01:48:10.306 --> 01:48:14.148]  And then suddenly, magically, the soundtrack comes back on.
[01:48:14.828 --> 01:48:24.535]  And the reason that's important is one video they did release, which was with a good soundtrack that shows the East Penthouse collapsing,
[01:48:25.630 --> 01:48:26.151]  I think so.
[01:48:42.225 --> 01:48:45.487]  There's no way that that wasn't an explosion, you know, an explosion.
[01:48:45.547 --> 01:48:47.949]  Well, cover-up is the evidence of a crime.
[01:48:47.989 --> 01:48:52.392]  How many times do cops, the good old-fashioned cops, wish we had some more of them today.
[01:48:52.412 --> 01:48:54.274]  I guess we still do in some cases.
[01:48:54.814 --> 01:48:59.958]  When you see somebody trying to cover something up, that's the evidence that you got the right guy.
[01:49:00.398 --> 01:49:03.681]  And everywhere surrounding 9-11 is a cover-up.
[01:49:03.741 --> 01:49:06.323]  I mean, they had armed guards guarding the pieces of the rubble.
[01:49:07.023 --> 01:49:09.485]  Of 7, Tower 1 and 2, North and South Tower.
[01:49:09.985 --> 01:49:11.346]  They shipped it off to China.
[01:49:11.766 --> 01:49:13.528]  They fought to not let people look at it.
[01:49:13.968 --> 01:49:18.231]  There was molten 3,000 degree steel a month and a half later.
[01:49:18.251 --> 01:49:23.034]  I mean, whatever they used to blow those up, I mean, this was pretty science fiction-esque.
[01:49:23.335 --> 01:49:24.776]  We know it wasn't jet fuel.
[01:49:26.517 --> 01:49:27.638]  No, it certainly wasn't.
[01:49:27.778 --> 01:49:33.702]  And yeah, I've seen, I've got several videos that have references to
[01:49:34.432 --> 01:49:37.315]  Molten steel and rivers of steel flowing.
[01:49:38.155 --> 01:49:44.921]  I need to go ahead and, you know, rip it off the DVD that they sent me and put it up on my YouTube channel.
[01:49:44.961 --> 01:49:56.611]  But, I mean, for example, I've got one video of a talk that Leslie Robertson, who is the structural engineer that helped build the Twin Towers,
[01:49:57.351 --> 01:50:06.256]  He was giving a presentation at Stanford University and one of the students asks a question after it's over and he kind of gives this offhand remark about how
[01:50:07.122 --> 01:50:15.347]  The cleanup crew took him down and showed him where there was a river of steel flowing underneath the debris.
[01:50:15.927 --> 01:50:18.549]  And, I mean, you can't contradict that.
[01:50:18.589 --> 01:50:21.651]  I mean, this is a very high-level guy.
[01:50:21.671 --> 01:50:25.893]  But we have all the firemen on video saying it was like a foundry.
[01:50:25.953 --> 01:50:26.954]  It was just lava.
[01:50:27.594 --> 01:50:27.814]  Right.
[01:50:27.854 --> 01:50:32.877]  And then you've got John Gross at the University of Texas saying, where was the molten metal?
[01:50:33.157 --> 01:50:34.158]  I've never seen this.
[01:50:36.644 --> 01:50:37.585]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:50:38.246 --> 01:50:38.586]  It is.
[01:50:38.686 --> 01:50:42.410]  I want to come back and talk about how we get this video out faster to people.
[01:50:44.312 --> 01:50:48.396]  It might be a good idea to put it on a website, open source, for folks to download.
[01:50:49.417 --> 01:50:56.444]  In fact, it'd cost me a lot of money to do it, but if you want, we can put it on PrisonPlanet.tv so everybody can just grab the raw stuff.
[01:50:56.464 --> 01:50:57.024]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:57.685 --> 01:50:58.946]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:50:58.986 --> 01:51:04.331]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:04.571 --> 01:51:09.216]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:09.596 --> 01:51:14.681]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:15.181 --> 01:51:19.886]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:20.406 --> 01:51:22.268]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:51:22.688 --> 01:51:27.312]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:27.492 --> 01:51:28.392]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:28.613 --> 01:51:31.395]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:31.695 --> 01:51:34.997]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:35.297 --> 01:51:38.140]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:40.381]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:40.722 --> 01:51:41.642]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:41.662 --> 01:51:41.862]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:49.508 --> 01:51:54.030]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:54.330 --> 01:51:56.791]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:57.571 --> 01:51:59.472]  As gardeners, we can all relate.
[01:51:59.632 --> 01:52:02.013]  What do you do with all of the excess food that you grow?
[01:52:02.073 --> 01:52:09.695]  Freezing or canning may have been the process you've used, but the good folks at Excalibur Dehydrator have a healthy alternative to preserve the fruits of your labor.

[01:52:46.088 --> 01:52:46.949]  Drying 1-2-3 dot com.
[01:52:46.969 --> 01:52:47.429]  Or call 1-800-875-4254.
[01:52:47.449 --> 01:52:48.049]  That's 1-800-875-4254 today.
[01:52:48.069 --> 01:52:50.230]  A new way to improve your health has arrived.
[01:52:50.250 --> 01:52:53.372]  Your body's primary nutrient for detoxification and antioxidant power is glutathione.
[01:53:04.737 --> 01:53:09.521]  Glutathione mops up heavy metals and toxins of all kinds and carries them to the liver for elimination.
[01:53:09.981 --> 01:53:14.044]  Glutathione neutralizes free radicals, which keeps your cells younger and stops inflammation.
[01:53:14.444 --> 01:53:18.066]  Glutathione gives you a strong immune system and gives you greater athletic endurance.
[01:53:18.487 --> 01:53:22.490]  The problem is your body's natural production declines due to age and toxins.
[01:53:22.850 --> 01:53:26.172]  What's your body's best way to produce strong and useful levels of glutathione?
[01:53:26.552 --> 01:53:28.454]  It's One World Whey Protein Powder.
[01:53:29.054 --> 01:53:31.735]  One World Whey Protein Powder is an industry first.
[01:53:32.175 --> 01:53:34.976]  It comes from grass-fed cows and is never heated.
[01:53:35.456 --> 01:53:43.339]  This miraculous whey protein powder supplies your body with the nutrient power to increase your glutathione production by as much as 64% or more.
[01:53:43.799 --> 01:53:47.820]  The increase in strength, energy, and well-being can be pronounced and amazing.
[01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:48.560]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:53:48.580 --> 01:53:48.780]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:49.881]  Or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[01:54:16.610 --> 01:54:21.514]  Regardless of what you think about 9-11, it's being used to take your liberties.
[01:54:22.955 --> 01:54:27.218]  And we know we've got a criminal, swindling government that's just out of control.
[01:54:27.238 --> 01:54:35.183]  That doesn't mean everybody in the government's bad, just like everybody in the police force isn't bad, or everybody that works at a shoe store isn't bad.
[01:54:35.844 --> 01:54:41.808]  But corrupt people tend to gravitate towards power positions, especially in government.
[01:54:43.289 --> 01:54:44.230]  They have a hunger for it.
[01:54:45.251 --> 01:54:49.672]  And I'm sorry 9-11's an inside job, but I shouldn't have to apologize for telling the truth.
[01:54:51.533 --> 01:54:52.733]  We know we've been lied to.
[01:54:52.893 --> 01:54:55.854]  Six of the ten commissioners have come out on that subject.
[01:54:56.534 --> 01:55:05.556]  And James Gourley, the Executive Director of International Center for 9-1-1 Studies, it's ic911studies.org.
[01:55:06.537 --> 01:55:10.838]  We're going to have Bob McIlvain, who lost his son that day,
[01:55:11.998 --> 01:55:17.621]  Uh, with this groundbreaking Geraldo Rivera interview, we're going to play a clip of that, where Geraldo came around.
[01:55:17.641 --> 01:55:28.245]  You know, the humanity of this engineer and the father who lost his son, just laying out basic evidence, Geraldo had a little humanity.
[01:55:28.885 --> 01:55:31.987]  And people have asked, why has Geraldo had me on a few times on other issues?
[01:55:33.167 --> 01:55:36.209]  I think he's a closet 9-11 truther.
[01:55:36.689 --> 01:55:37.709]  I haven't been told that.
[01:55:38.229 --> 01:55:40.971]  I know there's some other closet 9-11 truthers at Fox.
[01:55:41.031 --> 01:55:42.091]  I'm not going to say any names.
[01:55:43.212 --> 01:55:52.776]  I know... What do you make, James, of Glenn Beck coming out and talking about, I don't know if you've seen this, that the government may stage terror attacks?
[01:55:52.816 --> 01:56:01.580]  I mean, the fact that Beck, who's demonized anybody that talks about government-sponsored terror, the fact that he would come out now with something like that, it really shows we're having an effect.
[01:56:02.864 --> 01:56:07.146]  Yeah, I have trouble understanding Glenn Beck.
[01:56:07.166 --> 01:56:18.032]  Sometimes he seems really good on issues and he'll have Tom Woods on to talk about Road to Serfdom, but then he'll go and just say the complete opposite the next day.
[01:56:21.643 --> 01:56:34.274]  I think everybody in media, like you always say, they all know it's an inside job, but they fear for losing their job, their political elite status, and all their inside connections.
[01:56:34.874 --> 01:56:38.938]  It's probably what prevents them from really talking about it truthfully.
[01:56:39.957 --> 01:56:41.018]  Well that's another example.
[01:56:41.038 --> 01:56:51.026]  Did you hear about, it's an APKHOU broke it, that almost all tap water in Texas has high levels of uranium and radium in it?
[01:56:51.406 --> 01:56:57.331]  I mean high levels, and that the state with the federal government has covered it up for several decades.
[01:56:58.652 --> 01:56:59.773]  I have not seen that, no.
[01:57:00.698 --> 01:57:01.818]  Well, here's the scary thing.
[01:57:02.258 --> 01:57:05.139]  What they don't tell you in these reports, we've already covered here before.
[01:57:05.759 --> 01:57:11.881]  My point is, I'm not just saying this now, they mine it at the phosphate mines out of the limestone.
[01:57:12.461 --> 01:57:14.221]  That's also where you mine uranium.
[01:57:14.501 --> 01:57:16.302]  They're not even pulling the uranium out of it.
[01:57:17.722 --> 01:57:19.502]  They're putting the uranium in the tap water.
[01:57:19.743 --> 01:57:21.543]  They're not just covering up that it's in there.
[01:57:22.663 --> 01:57:24.424]  Uranium isn't in natural tap water.
[01:57:25.364 --> 01:57:25.584]  Right.
[01:57:26.904 --> 01:57:28.124]  I mean, I hate to change subjects.
[01:57:28.165 --> 01:57:29.745]  The point is, is that
[01:57:31.138 --> 01:57:32.380]  How much do we sell out?
[01:57:32.420 --> 01:57:33.702]  I mean, what do we go along with?
[01:57:33.782 --> 01:57:43.796]  I mean, it's like we've become schizophrenic as a society where we're drinking uranium in the water, the government staging terror attacks, the troops are breathing depleted uranium.
[01:57:44.558 --> 01:57:45.880]  I mean, it's crazy!
[01:57:47.571 --> 01:58:00.380]  Yeah, I think 9-11 gives us the best chance to revolt, to get government back in check and back to a reasonable size.
[01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:06.604]  I would also applaud, God bless you and Matt Drudge for leading the charge on this TSA thing.
[01:58:06.624 --> 01:58:14.109]  That's another great opportunity to fight back against government power and you guys have done an awesome job on keeping the conversation going on that.
[01:58:14.397 --> 01:58:26.381]  I tell you what, do five more minutes with us, because I want to talk about where the International Center for 9-11 Studies is going in the future, and finish up your take on the TSA revolt that's happening.
[01:58:26.401 --> 01:58:35.724]  This is very exciting, and if we have a victory here, like we had on the carbon taxes last year, then we realize we can have even more victories.
[01:58:35.884 --> 01:58:36.504]  Back in one minute.
[01:58:40.446 --> 01:58:41.586]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:43.257 --> 01:58:45.448]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[01:58:47.315 --> 01:58:51.538]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:51.858 --> 01:58:52.459]  Number 1.
[01:58:52.779 --> 01:58:55.921]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:56.202 --> 01:58:56.762]  Number 2.
[01:58:57.062 --> 01:59:01.606]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:01.946 --> 01:59:02.386]  It's true.
[01:59:02.686 --> 01:59:07.250]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:07.570 --> 01:59:08.110]  Number 3.
[01:59:08.391 --> 01:59:11.673]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:11.973 --> 01:59:15.676]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:15.876 --> 01:59:16.417]  Number 4.
[01:59:16.677 --> 01:59:19.040]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:19.441 --> 01:59:22.805]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:23.125 --> 01:59:23.326]  Number 5.
[01:59:23.906 --> 01:59:27.831]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:28.052 --> 01:59:32.818]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:33.098 --> 01:59:37.121]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:37.261 --> 01:59:38.822]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:39.062 --> 01:59:41.143]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[01:59:43.905 --> 01:59:45.286]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:45.426 --> 01:59:51.110]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:02.133 --> 02:00:06.296]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:06.957 --> 02:00:07.757]  You want answers?
[02:00:08.538 --> 02:00:09.459]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:10.099 --> 02:00:13.722]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:14.282 --> 02:00:18.385]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:19.106 --> 02:00:23.629]  Okay, we got Bob McElveen, who lost his son on 9-11, joining us for about 30 minutes coming up.
[02:00:23.669 --> 02:00:26.872]  Then I'm going to take a few phone calls and get into the economic news.
[02:00:28.658 --> 02:00:43.666]  And some other important news we've got here in front of us, but James Gourley, chemical engineering, is also a lawyer, founder and executive director of the International Center for 9-11 Studies, just doing yeoman's work and needs your support.
[02:00:44.466 --> 02:00:50.069]  You were finishing up with your comment on the TSA and your view on that, and then you were telling me about
[02:00:50.609 --> 02:00:51.050]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:01:11.681 --> 02:01:29.723]  And we actually have, we have released one portion of the data that we've received, and it's called the, um, the Cumulus, the Cumulus Database, which is what they call this searchable database of video clips that they used, and they sent me basically that entire database, except, uh,
[02:01:30.484 --> 02:01:36.049]  I think they withheld some things that they claim under one of the exemptions to FOIA, but that's a whole other story.
[02:01:36.069 --> 02:01:49.662]  But our Chief Technical Officer at the International Center has actually compressed that 500 gigabytes down to, I think, 80 or 100 gigabytes using a lossless compression algorithm, and we released that over BitTorrent.
[02:01:50.563 --> 02:01:51.443]  You know, independent.
[02:01:51.523 --> 02:01:58.245]  He tells me that thousands of people have been downloading it, like there have been thousands of seeds on BitTorrent, so people, it's going all over the place.
[02:01:58.265 --> 02:02:09.029]  Oh yeah, and then it gets uploaded on YouTube and then, you know, kind of the group mind, the Liberty individualistic collective is then able to mine through it all.
[02:02:09.429 --> 02:02:10.449]  Very, very exciting.
[02:02:10.929 --> 02:02:12.370]  I want to point out the Drudge Report.
[02:02:13.374 --> 02:02:23.279]  is linked to our story about Big Sis, you know, caves in on the pilots, who again, they fly the aircraft.
[02:02:23.299 --> 02:02:25.741]  They shouldn't have to go through security, any security.
[02:02:26.381 --> 02:02:27.322]  This is asinine.
[02:02:28.042 --> 02:02:35.126]  But now we've got a new, even more important article up at PrisonPlanet.com, and I'm told it's going up on InfoWars.com.
[02:02:35.806 --> 02:02:42.093]  It's Big Sis caught lying to the American people in her USA Today piece, and it's just all lies.
[02:02:42.494 --> 02:02:49.301]  And it's so important to show how she's lying to you because then it destroys any credibility she had.
[02:02:49.882 --> 02:02:51.104]  Your comment on that, James?
[02:02:51.966 --> 02:02:55.307]  Yeah, I mean, I've been really enjoying the coverage you've been giving it.
[02:02:55.347 --> 02:03:09.833]  I mean, it really warms my heart every time Drudge links to your website, to an article on your site, because I know people are going to go there and they're going to be exposed to all kinds of other information that they need to see that they might not have been exposed to it otherwise.
[02:03:09.913 --> 02:03:11.733]  So, I mean, I think it's just great.
[02:03:11.793 --> 02:03:15.815]  Drudge has probably linked to your website, what, ten times in the last two weeks?
[02:03:16.909 --> 02:03:18.991]  Yeah, I think it's exactly 10 times.
[02:03:19.992 --> 02:03:23.515]  He's been continually linked to us now for 11 days.
[02:03:23.595 --> 02:03:27.678]  Last night he took down the articles we had and he put new ones up today.
[02:03:28.359 --> 02:03:33.864]  And again, Drudge had 9 billion page views this year alone.
[02:03:34.784 --> 02:03:35.365]  9 billion.
[02:03:35.385 --> 02:03:36.145]  That's not hits.
[02:03:36.826 --> 02:03:43.070]  That's page views, and they calculate that's probably more than 7 billion people visiting it.
[02:03:43.290 --> 02:03:51.475]  Of course, many of them over and over again, but it's the number one news website in places like Japan, in areas of Africa, Europe.
[02:03:51.815 --> 02:04:01.501]  I mean, it just has such a huge effect, and obviously it's booing everything we do at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and that's my goal.
[02:04:02.631 --> 02:04:08.177]  is to try to bring sanity back to society and it just shows how far we've come again to have Geraldo Rivera
[02:04:09.420 --> 02:04:09.680]  Thanks.
[02:04:09.700 --> 02:04:10.040]  You too, Alex.
[02:04:34.801 --> 02:04:36.042]  Alright, that's an awesome interview.
[02:04:36.363 --> 02:04:37.464]  Just a great job.
[02:04:37.484 --> 02:04:43.309]  Again, a lawyer taking action, getting all this footage, and it's just every week, bombshell, bombshell, bombshell.
[02:04:43.630 --> 02:04:48.634]  And they've only gone through a tiny fraction of five, almost five terabytes of video.
[02:04:49.415 --> 02:04:51.697]  Can you imagine the smoking guns that are waiting?
[02:04:52.758 --> 02:04:56.960]  We'll be right back ladies and gentlemen stay with us with Bob McIlvain lost his son on 9-11.
[02:04:57.440 --> 02:04:59.041]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:04:59.081 --> 02:05:01.902]  You've heard me talk about Calden five-star soaps for years.
[02:05:02.463 --> 02:05:07.385]  This is an American-made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[02:05:07.665 --> 02:05:10.827]  You can buy factory direct shipped via UPS right to your door.
[02:05:11.107 --> 02:05:13.448]  Check them out on the web at fivestarsoap.com
[02:05:14.068 --> 02:05:14.949]  Or call 800-340-7091.
[02:05:17.611 --> 02:05:18.571]  Take my word for it.
[02:05:18.751 --> 02:05:21.073]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[02:05:21.413 --> 02:05:27.618]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[02:05:27.918 --> 02:05:29.319]  Buy American and stay clean.

[02:05:33.122 --> 02:05:34.463]  Well, Marty, what do you have to say?
[02:05:37.725 --> 02:05:44.987]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, satisfaction is guaranteed or double your dirt back!

[02:05:49.468 --> 02:05:49.988]  Thank you!
[02:05:58.268 --> 02:06:01.871]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:06:02.292 --> 02:06:05.295]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:06:05.535 --> 02:06:10.299]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:06:10.319 --> 02:06:16.545]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:06:16.705 --> 02:06:18.948]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:06:19.488 --> 02:06:19.768]  Tim Geithner?
[02:06:19.788 --> 02:06:20.228]  Bernanke?
[02:06:20.309 --> 02:06:20.909]  They're arsonists!
[02:06:20.969 --> 02:06:22.190]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:06:22.230 --> 02:06:24.491]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:06:38.399 --> 02:06:40.221]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:06:40.241 --> 02:06:45.305]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:06:45.666 --> 02:06:54.794]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:57.173 --> 02:07:00.476]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:07:00.756 --> 02:07:01.837]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:07:02.058 --> 02:07:06.242]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:07:06.462 --> 02:07:12.107]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:07:12.407 --> 02:07:14.389]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:07:14.549 --> 02:07:17.232]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:07:17.572 --> 02:07:23.875]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[02:07:24.076 --> 02:07:25.877]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:07:26.277 --> 02:07:31.359]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:07:31.620 --> 02:07:36.622]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:07:36.902 --> 02:07:42.125]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[02:07:42.285 --> 02:07:45.207]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[02:07:45.467 --> 02:07:48.411]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[02:07:48.531 --> 02:07:50.153]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:07:50.193 --> 02:07:53.197]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.850 --> 02:08:23.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a key story at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:08:23.761 --> 02:08:26.786]  It's Big Schist Caught Lying.
[02:08:28.021 --> 02:08:39.674]  Now, that's a long thing to put in the Google search engine, and I meant to do it in the first hour, but it didn't go up until about 15 minutes ago, and it's an excellent, detailed article that Steve Watson put together.
[02:08:39.714 --> 02:08:41.596]  I know why it took him a lot longer to put together.
[02:08:42.176 --> 02:08:46.281]  There are so many lies, it will make your head spin.
[02:08:46.801 --> 02:08:47.602]  This is a big deal.
[02:08:48.283 --> 02:08:50.244]  They staged the events of 9-11.
[02:08:50.684 --> 02:08:52.605]  They use it to federalize America.
[02:08:53.065 --> 02:09:05.010]  Their own internal Homeland Security reports say returning veterans, gun owners, libertarians, anti-war people, anybody who's politically active, you are the terrorist.
[02:09:06.271 --> 02:09:10.133]  Meanwhile, the pilots, they're trying to, you know, grope them.
[02:09:10.713 --> 02:09:12.514]  It's all about domination and control.
[02:09:13.484 --> 02:09:16.787]  And they use 9-11 to launch all these illegal wars.
[02:09:17.207 --> 02:09:22.252]  They use 9-11 to make the government more secretive with the trillions missing from the Pentagon.
[02:09:22.292 --> 02:09:23.433]  It's over four trillion now.
[02:09:23.993 --> 02:09:25.494]  It's bipartisan corruption.
[02:09:25.875 --> 02:09:38.346]  And she writes a big article in USA Today, written by Big Sis, by Janet Napolitano, and she writes this huge article.
[02:09:39.355 --> 02:09:42.856]  And the entire thing is a tissue of lies.
[02:09:42.896 --> 02:09:49.018]  So I want to Google search the term, Big Sis Caught Lying.
[02:09:49.858 --> 02:09:52.959]  Big Sis Caught Lying.
[02:09:54.280 --> 02:10:01.622]  And you can alternately just put in Big Sis Caught as another search, but Big Sis Caught Lying.
[02:10:02.588 --> 02:10:04.068]  Big Sis Caught Lying.
[02:10:04.128 --> 02:10:07.629]  Put B-I-G-S-I-S Caught Lying.
[02:10:08.529 --> 02:10:10.290]  Or you could just say Big Sis Lying.
[02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:12.870]  There's a lot of different ways to put it in, but whatever you do, just pick one.
[02:10:13.571 --> 02:10:14.551]  Big Sis Caught Lying.
[02:10:14.591 --> 02:10:16.291]  Let's just go with that as number one search term.
[02:10:16.311 --> 02:10:17.232]  Big Sis Caught Lying.
[02:10:17.292 --> 02:10:17.832]  Four words.
[02:10:18.352 --> 02:10:19.232]  Big Sis Caught Lying.
[02:10:19.252 --> 02:10:20.432]  Put it into Google over and over again.
[02:10:20.452 --> 02:10:21.693]  It's having a huge effect.
[02:10:21.833 --> 02:10:22.753]  The globalists hate this.
[02:10:26.194 --> 02:10:28.414]  This is a key way to revolt against these people.
[02:10:28.894 --> 02:10:30.735]  Big Sis Caught Lying.
[02:10:30.775 --> 02:10:31.315]  And then the other
[02:10:32.824 --> 02:10:35.245]  The search term is Big Sis Lying.
[02:10:35.345 --> 02:10:36.305]  Just take the caught out.
[02:10:36.745 --> 02:10:38.646]  Big Sis Lying and Big Sis Caught Lying.
[02:10:39.006 --> 02:10:40.306]  And I know we'll make it number one.
[02:10:40.326 --> 02:10:41.666]  It should be number one in the next two hours.
[02:10:42.006 --> 02:10:45.848]  This is the ongoing revolt to show them the power of the American people.
[02:10:46.128 --> 02:10:48.208]  Let's show her what the alternative media can do.
[02:10:48.668 --> 02:10:52.889]  She's in USA Today telling us, we search you in private areas.
[02:10:52.949 --> 02:10:53.310]  No, they don't.
[02:10:53.330 --> 02:10:54.210]  They do it out in public.
[02:10:54.830 --> 02:10:58.351]  The genital squeezing is not invasive.
[02:10:58.751 --> 02:11:00.311]  There's no radiation in these.
[02:11:00.351 --> 02:11:01.752]  The scientists say it's safe.
[02:11:02.937 --> 02:11:06.860]  She goes on and says we've always been doing these pat-downs, which is a lie.
[02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:09.801]  They are intensifying the pat-downs.
[02:11:10.242 --> 02:11:11.222]  In a way, though, it's true.
[02:11:11.262 --> 02:11:19.567]  I was just in a video of a little three-year-old girl crying and screaming as a TSA worker grabs them in areas from two years ago.
[02:11:21.228 --> 02:11:25.171]  I mean, they've done these sometimes, but now they want to do it to everybody, so that's the change.
[02:11:26.492 --> 02:11:27.713]  So it's just all lies.
[02:11:27.853 --> 02:11:31.616]  She also says they're not saving the images, which is an admitted lie.
[02:11:32.197 --> 02:11:34.078]  Big Sis caught lying to the American people.
[02:11:34.519 --> 02:11:36.620]  It's up at PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:11:36.921 --> 02:11:43.806]  Okay, before we go to Bob McIlvain, who's no stranger to this show, great patriot, tells it like it is, lost his son on 9-11.
[02:11:45.996 --> 02:11:49.457]  I want to play a brief clip of Geraldo Rivera.
[02:11:49.797 --> 02:11:50.917]  It's a seven-minute clip.
[02:11:51.397 --> 02:11:54.158]  It's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:11:55.098 --> 02:11:57.658]  And it is extremely powerful.
[02:11:57.758 --> 02:12:03.780]  And they show Larry Silverstein talking about giving the order to blow up seven, which he said on television.
[02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:04.800]  We're supposed to ignore that.
[02:12:04.820 --> 02:12:05.960]  It's all hidden in plain view.
[02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:09.201]  Geraldo Rivera changes his mind on architects
[02:12:10.367 --> 02:12:10.927]  Well, I'm not done.
[02:12:10.947 --> 02:12:11.687]  I'm still a parent.
[02:12:23.846 --> 02:12:27.748]  I'm a parent who has an obligation to find out why my son was murdered.
[02:12:28.549 --> 02:12:33.492]  As far as this show and New York City, I want the investigation.
[02:12:33.512 --> 02:12:35.613]  That will not be sufficient enough.
[02:12:35.633 --> 02:12:37.694]  Not heal your wound, I get it.
[02:12:37.854 --> 02:12:38.675]  I'm going beyond that.
[02:12:38.695 --> 02:12:39.275]  But it's the beginning.
[02:12:39.355 --> 02:12:42.497]  Of course it's the beginning, but that's why I support this Building What campaign.
[02:12:42.797 --> 02:12:44.278]  Bob McIlvaine, we thank you.
[02:12:44.358 --> 02:12:46.139]  Tony Zambotti, thank you very much.
[02:12:46.199 --> 02:12:48.800]  It is an intriguing topic.
[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:52.082]  I certainly am much more open-minded about it than I was.
[02:12:52.102 --> 02:12:56.964]  And it is because of the involvement of the 9-11 families and all these engineers and architects.
[02:12:57.424 --> 02:12:58.885]  Clearly, they know more than I do.
[02:12:59.685 --> 02:13:00.246]  Thanks, gentlemen.
[02:13:00.306 --> 02:13:00.606]  Thank you.
[02:13:01.584 --> 02:13:02.725]  This is a Fox News Alert.
[02:13:02.865 --> 02:13:13.073]  Okay, so they've always had this lie on CNN, Fox, MSNBC, CNBC that the families hate you when you talk about inside job or a new investigation.
[02:13:14.614 --> 02:13:30.206]  I've had the head of the biggest victims family group on the radio, and it's in my film Terror Storm, we have the clip, and he said that half or more, and that was four years ago, of the 9-11 families believe total inside job and that he believes it.
[02:13:32.523 --> 02:13:36.253]  They've had polls in New York of 83% believe they're being lied to.
[02:13:37.035 --> 02:13:38.459]  Angus and Reed New York Times poll, 83%, 2006.
[02:13:41.061 --> 02:13:43.623]  We've had CNN polls of 80 plus percent.
[02:13:44.163 --> 02:13:45.084]  We're the majority.
[02:13:45.564 --> 02:13:47.906]  Six of the ten commissioners said it was a fraud and a lie.
[02:13:48.386 --> 02:13:52.409]  So this minority sits up there and says we're kooks, we shouldn't look into this.
[02:13:52.589 --> 02:14:03.277]  Now it comes out, Fox News and AP, that Anwar al-Awlaki, this is three weeks ago now, the number three guy in Al Qaeda in 2001, now number one under bin Laden,
[02:14:04.679 --> 02:14:07.221]  Is hanging out secretly at the Pentagon with the top brass.
[02:14:08.041 --> 02:14:12.844]  And the underwear bomber was gotten on the plane by the State Department under CIA orders.
[02:14:12.884 --> 02:14:13.684]  This is all admitted.
[02:14:14.125 --> 02:14:16.446]  And a lock, he was in control of the Fort Hood shooter.
[02:14:16.746 --> 02:14:17.527]  And he was protected.
[02:14:19.346 --> 02:14:27.651]  Yeah, there's some Froot Loop crazy Muslims out there, like there's Froot Loop crazy Christians or whatever, or Froot Loop crazy Jews, or Germans, or Italians, or any other group.
[02:14:28.092 --> 02:14:32.635]  And the point is, the government's going out and finding them, and then letting them do stuff to take our rights.
[02:14:32.935 --> 02:14:34.796]  But that's not what happened on 9-11.
[02:14:35.116 --> 02:14:36.737]  This was a pure inside job.
[02:14:37.378 --> 02:14:39.279]  They blew up Building 7 in front of everybody.
[02:14:40.328 --> 02:14:47.590]  And Bob McIlvain, what is it like for you to see Geraldo Rivera start to tell the truth and say, oh, because the families are involved?
[02:14:47.870 --> 02:14:49.071]  You've always been involved.
[02:14:49.351 --> 02:14:53.052]  The families were there at the commission holding up signs saying, lies, lies, lies.
[02:14:53.112 --> 02:14:53.672]  You were there.
[02:14:54.312 --> 02:14:57.273]  They ordered Sybil Evans, the FBI translator, not to talk.
[02:14:57.513 --> 02:15:01.015]  She heard, quote, the CIA in command of bin Laden on 9-11.
[02:15:02.645 --> 02:15:04.307]  She's broken her gag order, as you know.
[02:15:04.327 --> 02:15:06.248]  I mean, it's the same story.
[02:15:06.789 --> 02:15:09.351]  And what is it like for you now and your son that you lost?
[02:15:09.391 --> 02:15:16.117]  Tell folks briefly about him so they can personalize this and understand to really start to see some headway get going here.
[02:15:16.137 --> 02:15:22.083]  Well, I'll tell you, I just can't believe how anxious I was going up there because, you know, this is what I did.
[02:15:22.103 --> 02:15:25.106]  This is what I've done since 9-11-2001.
[02:15:25.286 --> 02:15:28.509]  And, of course, the media just refuses to cover it.
[02:15:29.346 --> 02:15:30.326]  So we got the call.
[02:15:30.546 --> 02:15:32.947]  It was just, uh, yeah, it's all for Bobby.
[02:15:32.967 --> 02:15:35.708]  Again, we briefly talked about Bobby.
[02:15:35.768 --> 02:15:37.208]  Bobby was 26 years old.
[02:15:37.408 --> 02:15:39.529]  He had, uh, graduated from Princeton.
[02:15:40.730 --> 02:15:49.872]  Uh, he started work in New York, and he had just started work with Merrill Lynch, which was not in the Towers, uh, you know, I guess a month and a half, two months before 9-11.
[02:15:50.072 --> 02:15:58.395]  And, uh, I am very, so interested in the Towers, just not, of course, just not seven, but one and two because of the explosions.
[02:15:59.321 --> 02:16:12.223]  Which, of course, NIST, which is the National Institute of Standard Technology, which investigated Building 7, and the 9-11 Commission, which I made 90% of, everyone just ignored the idea that there was explosions.
[02:16:12.243 --> 02:16:17.004]  Of course, you need explosions for, uh, uh, demolition.
[02:16:17.924 --> 02:16:29.026]  And it's taken me, uh, geez, four or five years, it took me at least four or five years to finally track down what happened to Bobby, and I've found out, I've talked to the doctors, I know, I know his injuries, I have pictures of his injuries,
[02:16:30.226 --> 02:16:35.489]  And he was one of the bodies found immediately, one of the first 10 bodies, and he had died coming down.
[02:16:35.509 --> 02:16:45.895]  He had just gotten off the subway, walked over to Merrill Lynch at the last second, decided to go up on the 106th floor, but before I think just as he walked into the lobby of the North Tower, he was blown up.
[02:16:48.721 --> 02:17:01.747]  And now there's all these new NIST videos talking about how there were explosions going off and that's what Willie Rodriguez and others have said is that there were explosions going off before planes even hit, like seconds before.
[02:17:02.047 --> 02:17:09.531]  Well people have to understand too that you need explosions and any demolition, you're going to have explosions at stage 4, the actual demolition itself.
[02:17:10.371 --> 02:17:16.054]  So there's a strong possibility because again the nature of my son's injuries were chest and face.
[02:17:17.209 --> 02:17:19.050]  Severe lacerations all over the place.
[02:17:19.391 --> 02:17:22.333]  I think he was walking in the doors before the plane hit.
[02:17:22.353 --> 02:17:23.934]  Because if the plane hit, he would have run.
[02:17:23.954 --> 02:17:27.036]  And if he had died, he would have had injuries in the back.
[02:17:27.276 --> 02:17:28.477]  But that's beside the point.
[02:17:30.058 --> 02:17:34.861]  So I had taken his body home that week, and it's taken me so long to find out exactly what did happen to him.
[02:17:34.921 --> 02:17:36.803]  So the explosions are a big key to me.
[02:17:37.523 --> 02:17:42.126]  And of course, as a parent, I'm looking at this as, hey, these are the murders from my son.
[02:17:42.286 --> 02:17:45.849]  And of course, the anger I had, it's profound anger.
[02:17:47.098 --> 02:17:53.582]  But I need that anger because it keeps me going because if you don't have that anger... What is it like when you watch Bush grandstanding on the pile?
[02:17:54.122 --> 02:17:54.742]  It's brutal.
[02:17:55.343 --> 02:17:56.723]  You can't imagine.
[02:17:56.743 --> 02:18:08.050]  Again, the only way I can tell you is if you have children and your child was murdered and they refuse to have an investigation and yet you know who the murderer is.
[02:18:08.570 --> 02:18:12.332]  And then the murderers grandstand as our saviors as well.
[02:18:12.752 --> 02:18:13.012]  Right.
[02:18:13.212 --> 02:18:15.634]  But you just have to imagine that though.
[02:18:17.697 --> 02:18:21.586]  Right, but they're green standing, so... And you have to tone down your anger.
[02:18:21.707 --> 02:18:26.077]  But this is why a lot of family members won't speak up about it, because you've got to find other means to cope in life.
[02:18:26.764 --> 02:18:28.845]  And to carry that anger around with me is just mind-boggling.
[02:18:29.006 --> 02:18:48.679]  Absolutely, but the issue of the mainstream media having to start warming up to 9-11 truth, because 7 stands on its own, and if you look at the numbers and the polls, 9-11 truth has gotten stronger, not weaker, and I believe this is the beginning of the system having to capitulate, Bob.
[02:18:48.699 --> 02:18:50.220]  Well, I really hope.
[02:18:50.300 --> 02:18:54.123]  I really, you know, and I can't get optimistic, because, you know, you just
[02:18:54.690 --> 02:18:56.131]  I hate being knocked down constantly.
[02:18:56.151 --> 02:18:57.973]  I mean, I've been doing this for years and years.
[02:18:58.713 --> 02:19:01.515]  You know, I get my hopes up and, you know, this is going to be a beginning.
[02:19:01.535 --> 02:19:02.496]  And I really do.
[02:19:02.516 --> 02:19:03.957]  I mean, it was a big, big deal.
[02:19:05.078 --> 02:19:06.479]  And we just got to keep after it.
[02:19:06.539 --> 02:19:10.082]  But I just, you know, it's like taking baby steps.
[02:19:10.142 --> 02:19:14.105]  I just have to say, well, maybe this will be the thing that throws us there for the top.
[02:19:14.145 --> 02:19:18.368]  Because I just want so desperately the world to know that this is what governments do.
[02:19:18.648 --> 02:19:20.390]  Specifically, in this case, our government.
[02:19:22.506 --> 02:19:24.668]  No, it's big progress.
[02:19:25.128 --> 02:19:34.014]  Well, he couldn't sit there with two real human beings, a father and an engineer, and see the facts and then say hateful things to you.
[02:19:34.034 --> 02:19:36.595]  I have a lot more respect for Geraldo Rivera.
[02:19:52.707 --> 02:19:54.409]  But I can tell him I got he was a truther.
[02:19:54.749 --> 02:19:55.490]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:55.510 --> 02:19:55.911]  Stay with us.
[02:19:55.931 --> 02:19:59.596]  Do you know someone who's a Constitution basher?
[02:19:59.716 --> 02:20:00.698]  Then here's the M.O.
[02:20:00.738 --> 02:20:02.901]  you need to silence them once and for all.
[02:20:03.141 --> 02:20:05.024]  Introducing the crash course of the U.S.
[02:20:05.064 --> 02:20:05.805]  Constitution.
[02:20:06.045 --> 02:20:08.609]  How to argue with a liberal about constitutional issues.
[02:20:08.629 --> 02:20:09.049]  I don't know.
[02:20:30.675 --> 02:20:30.915]  I think so.
[02:20:57.182 --> 02:21:02.045]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:21:02.145 --> 02:21:02.926]  What have we got?
[02:21:03.146 --> 02:21:05.287]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:21:05.587 --> 02:21:06.348]  A republic.
[02:21:06.608 --> 02:21:09.189]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:21:09.249 --> 02:21:11.171]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:21:11.511 --> 02:21:13.412]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:21:13.532 --> 02:21:14.813]  So they think they own our land?
[02:21:15.233 --> 02:21:16.334]  They think they own our water?
[02:21:16.534 --> 02:21:16.934]  Children?
[02:21:17.154 --> 02:21:17.935]  Our education?
[02:21:18.275 --> 02:21:18.895]  Our money?
[02:21:19.096 --> 02:21:22.758]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:21:23.118 --> 02:21:26.764]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:21:26.804 --> 02:21:27.745]  You are being warned.
[02:21:28.086 --> 02:21:28.907]  We have the facts.
[02:21:29.108 --> 02:21:30.229]  We have the Constitution.
[02:21:30.269 --> 02:21:31.151]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:21:31.191 --> 02:21:32.012]  We have common law.
[02:21:32.072 --> 02:21:34.316]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:21:34.596 --> 02:21:38.362]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:21:38.462 --> 02:21:43.244]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:21:43.424 --> 02:21:44.804]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:21:44.924 --> 02:21:45.765]  Don't tread on me.
[02:21:46.005 --> 02:21:52.427]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:21:57.481 --> 02:22:01.625]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[02:22:01.665 --> 02:22:02.926]  dollar has been devaluating.
[02:22:03.106 --> 02:22:06.810]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[02:22:07.090 --> 02:22:09.632]  Is there a way to protect your portfolios from losing value?
[02:22:09.833 --> 02:22:11.634]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[02:22:11.814 --> 02:22:14.917]  They both have maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[02:22:15.157 --> 02:22:17.500]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them until now,
[02:22:22.284 --> 02:22:23.865]  Your cash would have the buying power of only $4,800.
[02:22:25.447 --> 02:22:27.348]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[02:22:27.408 --> 02:22:30.511]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.

[02:24:02.099 --> 02:24:07.822]  Coming up in the next segment, we've got a two-year-old video of a small child being grabbed by TSA and crying.
[02:24:08.423 --> 02:24:11.785]  So they've been doing this enhanced rape down for a long time.
[02:24:12.265 --> 02:24:17.168]  Bob McElveen, what's your view on the TSA and the stuff going on?
[02:24:18.749 --> 02:24:21.511]  I just can't see myself getting on a plane again.
[02:24:21.531 --> 02:24:22.551]  Talk about my anger.
[02:24:22.571 --> 02:24:24.793]  I can't imagine someone searching me like that.
[02:24:24.833 --> 02:24:26.153]  I think I'd have to punch them in the mouth.
[02:24:26.894 --> 02:24:29.696]  I'm really worried about it because my wife definitely still wants to travel.
[02:24:31.434 --> 02:24:32.455]  It's mind-boggling.
[02:24:32.675 --> 02:24:33.595]  Absolutely mind-boggling.
[02:24:33.675 --> 02:24:35.335]  And this, of course, goes back to 9-11.
[02:24:36.236 --> 02:24:39.077]  That's why 9-11 is so important.
[02:24:39.257 --> 02:24:40.437]  Everything that has happened.
[02:24:40.477 --> 02:24:42.238]  I mean, the world is just upside-down.
[02:24:42.918 --> 02:24:49.300]  And what they do is, you know, when you're talking about al-Qaeda, we have to realize this is all a myth.
[02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:51.721]  It's not a lie, it's become a myth.
[02:24:52.281 --> 02:24:56.843]  President Kennedy said it once, he said, the enemy of truth is not the lie, it is the myth.
[02:24:56.863 --> 02:24:57.903]  Well, it does become a myth.
[02:24:58.621 --> 02:25:04.944]  Well, here you are with these goons and you know it's an inside job and everything they're doing is made up, built on a fraud.
[02:25:25.334 --> 02:25:32.941]  And Bob, I wish every time that there was a terror attack, I'm like, please let it be a real Muslim, because that's not very scary, knowing there's a few, you know, nuts out there.
[02:25:33.201 --> 02:25:39.747]  I mean, there's people getting mugged and killed every day in the town I live in, of a million people, and they don't act like it's the end of the world when somebody gets killed?
[02:25:40.027 --> 02:25:41.048]  That's what goes on!
[02:25:41.428 --> 02:25:51.457]  But then, if it's a Muslim blowing something up, it gets a million times scarier, and we've got to give all our rights up, and then every time you research it, it's the government behind it all!
[02:25:51.718 --> 02:25:51.978]  Great!
[02:25:52.498 --> 02:25:54.719]  And that's, you know, how do you get that?
[02:25:54.739 --> 02:25:56.160]  How do we get that in schools?
[02:25:56.220 --> 02:26:05.303]  I mean, it's understanding history, you know, especially since the 70s when they developed this strategy of tension, you know, when they've been working with these people forever.
[02:26:05.323 --> 02:26:06.644]  That's what people have to understand.
[02:26:07.024 --> 02:26:09.725]  It's easy to find a patsy to do these bidding things.
[02:26:09.745 --> 02:26:13.026]  You know, you have some joker on a plane that someone led them on.
[02:26:13.546 --> 02:26:16.468]  You know, he's from India, you know, from the State Department.
[02:26:16.488 --> 02:26:17.388]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:26:18.657 --> 02:26:24.360]  If you travel around the world, you realize that we, especially in the United States, live in a bubble.
[02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:28.822]  And especially if you talk to people in Russia, they know it's propaganda here.
[02:26:28.862 --> 02:26:30.183]  We still think it's free press.
[02:26:30.583 --> 02:26:32.644]  And that's our biggest storm problem in this country.
[02:26:33.024 --> 02:26:34.544]  I think that's starting to change.
[02:26:35.185 --> 02:26:43.507]  Well, it's buildingwhat.org, and it's having a big effect, and folks have been supporting and getting the word out.
[02:26:43.987 --> 02:26:51.749]  And Bob, I appreciate you popping in with us today, but even if it takes five years, ten years, we're winning in the court of public opinion.
[02:26:52.209 --> 02:26:55.070]  The government is losing its tool of staged terror.
[02:26:55.690 --> 02:26:59.491]  Even Glenn Beck last week said the government may stage in Oklahoma City.
[02:27:00.452 --> 02:27:01.352]  What's your take on that?
[02:27:02.062 --> 02:27:04.891]  Well, I try hard not to listen to Glenn Beck.
[02:27:05.031 --> 02:27:06.195]  I mean, he's right.
[02:27:10.549 --> 02:27:12.090]  I try to avoid watching TV as much as I can.
[02:27:12.130 --> 02:27:12.550]  Sure, sure.
[02:27:12.570 --> 02:27:23.395]  But what I'm saying is regardless to stay in the game, to stay relevant, Geraldo Rivera is, you know, talking about inside job and saying, boy, that's a good point.
[02:27:23.455 --> 02:27:24.256]  I see what you're saying.
[02:27:24.716 --> 02:27:27.377]  And Glenn Beck's talking about Obama blowing stuff up.
[02:27:27.397 --> 02:27:27.557]  Right.
[02:27:27.837 --> 02:27:29.238]  Well, I got news for you, Beck.
[02:27:29.478 --> 02:27:30.839]  They all blow stuff up.
[02:27:31.299 --> 02:27:38.322]  They blow stuff up in Argentina on September 11th, decades ago with Pinochet.
[02:27:38.562 --> 02:27:39.563]  Or Chile, excuse me.
[02:27:40.103 --> 02:27:42.445]  You know, they do it all over the world.
[02:27:42.505 --> 02:27:43.726]  It's been declassified.
[02:27:44.106 --> 02:27:46.808]  Grow up and realize that Hitler did it, Beck.
[02:27:47.429 --> 02:27:49.910]  And stop attacking people like us that tell the truth.
[02:27:50.131 --> 02:27:50.571]  That's right.
[02:27:50.591 --> 02:27:52.252]  That's what has to be done.
[02:27:52.412 --> 02:27:53.533]  People have to be educated.
[02:27:53.593 --> 02:27:54.514]  That's what it's all about.
[02:27:55.735 --> 02:28:00.098]  We've only got a few minutes left, Bob, but any other points you'd like to impart to the listening audience?
[02:28:02.240 --> 02:28:06.483]  Well, let me just briefly talk about Geraldo.
[02:28:06.503 --> 02:28:09.325]  He talked to us a few minutes before we went on the air.
[02:28:10.074 --> 02:28:14.316]  And again, I was very anxious about it, and I just think he did a wonderful job.
[02:28:14.336 --> 02:28:19.438]  That's where the hope is, the fact that he did that.
[02:28:21.559 --> 02:28:27.442]  He wanted to talk about Bobby, but he actually explained to me, he said, look, we just don't have the time because there's certain key points I want to make.
[02:28:28.479 --> 02:28:33.420]  And the people behind the scenes, everyone just treated us tremendously.
[02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:35.021]  So that gives me hope.
[02:28:35.041 --> 02:28:36.301]  Oh, and another quick story.
[02:28:36.341 --> 02:28:40.142]  We walked out of the studio and Huckabee was there.
[02:28:40.702 --> 02:28:43.543]  And he was supposed to appear like in 10 minutes later.
[02:28:43.563 --> 02:28:47.164]  And he stood up, grabbed our hands, shook our hands, and he said, this is astounding.
[02:28:47.204 --> 02:28:48.104]  I just can't believe it.
[02:28:51.047 --> 02:28:52.108]  It's all about the media.
[02:28:52.148 --> 02:28:54.090]  The fact that the media has kept this hidden.
[02:28:54.770 --> 02:28:56.472]  We actually felt it.
[02:28:56.652 --> 02:28:58.174]  I didn't know this about Building 7.
[02:28:58.374 --> 02:29:00.997]  And it's a controlled demolition.
[02:29:01.037 --> 02:29:04.740]  If everyone in the world had seen that, they'd say, that is a controlled demolition.
[02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:06.182]  No ifs, ands, and buts about it.
[02:29:06.682 --> 02:29:09.003]  So therefore, this is where we're going to start this investigation.
[02:29:09.083 --> 02:29:10.384]  Someone had a divage hit.
[02:29:10.624 --> 02:29:12.044]  Let's go to the demolition companies.
[02:29:12.064 --> 02:29:13.245]  Let's talk to Juliana.
[02:29:13.565 --> 02:29:23.349]  This has to come, and then it'll steamroll into the whole 9-11 scenario, because the 9-11 people aren't going to let this be the only thing that happens as part of the investigation.
[02:29:23.369 --> 02:29:25.290]  I'll tell you what, Bob, you're on to something key here.
[02:29:25.830 --> 02:29:31.313]  Stay with us a few more minutes before I get into the economy and this bombshell TSA information.
[02:29:31.873 --> 02:29:35.555]  I want to come back and continue that line of discussion, because Bo Dietl,
[02:29:36.448 --> 02:29:38.310]  You know, famous New York detective.
[02:29:39.952 --> 02:29:41.954]  We got footage that we are changed in.
[02:29:41.994 --> 02:29:43.316]  Well, I'll tell you about it when we get back.
[02:29:43.756 --> 02:29:45.578]  He was talking about bombs in the buildings, too.
[02:29:45.819 --> 02:29:46.439]  We have that footage.
[02:29:47.581 --> 02:29:48.482]  We're on the march.
[02:29:48.982 --> 02:29:50.564]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.505 --> 02:29:54.188]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.398 --> 02:30:00.679]  You're subject to public police action.
[02:30:01.540 --> 02:30:02.461]  Tyranny is here.
[02:30:02.821 --> 02:30:06.564]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:30:06.604 --> 02:30:08.966]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:30:08.986 --> 02:30:14.150]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:30:14.850 --> 02:30:21.115]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:30:21.515 --> 02:30:27.059]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:30:27.499 --> 02:30:31.162]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:30:31.662 --> 02:30:35.646]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:30:35.946 --> 02:30:41.872]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:30:41.892 --> 02:30:44.875]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:30:45.455 --> 02:30:46.897]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:30:47.437 --> 02:30:47.918]  It's here.

[02:30:57.185 --> 02:31:01.128]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:31:01.368 --> 02:31:07.412]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:31:07.772 --> 02:31:14.876]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:31:15.157 --> 02:31:19.740]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:22.181]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:31:24.983 --> 02:31:28.487]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:31:28.727 --> 02:31:30.990]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:31:31.030 --> 02:31:31.350]  Call us.
[02:31:57.829 --> 02:32:12.275]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:32:13.294 --> 02:32:17.015]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:17.996 --> 02:32:30.000]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:32:30.760 --> 02:32:38.023]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:32:38.723 --> 02:32:48.309]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:32:49.090 --> 02:32:52.352]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:32:53.013 --> 02:32:56.215]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:32:59.057 --> 02:33:04.620]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[02:33:05.061 --> 02:33:07.622]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:11.710 --> 02:33:14.073]  Here's some of the headlines at TSA.
[02:33:15.915 --> 02:33:17.638]  Caves on molesting pilots.
[02:33:18.218 --> 02:33:20.922]  Some of the headlines at GCNlive.com.
[02:33:21.843 --> 02:33:23.946]  TSA caves on molesting pilots.
[02:33:26.052 --> 02:33:28.173]  That's top-linked up on Drudge as well.
[02:33:28.994 --> 02:33:31.436]  Homeland Security trying to shut down air travel.
[02:33:31.896 --> 02:33:36.979]  Green Movement wants airlines nationalized so non-essential travel can be banned.
[02:33:37.520 --> 02:33:39.241]  That's at GCNlive.com.
[02:33:39.921 --> 02:33:43.364]  Coming up, I want to play this two-minute video right at the end of this hour.
[02:33:43.964 --> 02:33:48.247]  Call of Duty Black Ops shows good guys using torture.
[02:33:49.727 --> 02:33:51.868]  And George Bush is saying he'd order torture again.
[02:33:52.529 --> 02:33:58.853]  Well, then why are the people that got caught torturing in prison, but Bush gets to admit he ordered it?
[02:34:00.213 --> 02:34:01.734]  That's at GCNLive.com.
[02:34:04.256 --> 02:34:09.659]  And we've got a new breaking story, flashback, TSA goon molests three-year-old.
[02:34:09.719 --> 02:34:10.980]  That's at GCNLive.com.
[02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:18.164]  We're going to play the footage of the news person
[02:34:19.161 --> 02:34:22.386]  Filming it as the little girls crying and being grabbed on.
[02:34:25.063 --> 02:34:27.125]  That's just amazing information.
[02:34:27.185 --> 02:34:29.426]  Also, Big Sis caught lying to the American people.
[02:34:30.107 --> 02:34:37.833]  I'm glad Drudge linked to our TSA caves on molesting pilots, but I think this Big Sis caught lying to the American people.
[02:34:38.273 --> 02:34:41.856]  This is what everybody needs to see to understand this witch is a liar.
[02:34:42.697 --> 02:34:51.944]  I want to go over that information before I hit some economic news, but finishing up the very informative point that Bob McIlvain, who lost his son on 9-11,
[02:34:53.547 --> 02:34:54.087]  was covering.
[02:34:54.568 --> 02:35:02.832]  In Truth Rising, We Are Change New York got footage of Bo Dietl who had protested because he's a co-host sometimes with Rolando Rivera.
[02:35:03.332 --> 02:35:05.573]  They were having a live show outside.
[02:35:05.893 --> 02:35:10.075]  I protested and you know Dietl was acting like a tough guy and stuff so I was screaming at him.
[02:35:10.776 --> 02:35:14.798]  But then he saw We Are Change later and said, I want to talk to you guys.
[02:35:18.373 --> 02:35:23.018]  You know, the way those buildings came down, it had to be bombs, and that's what other police and firemen said.
[02:35:23.318 --> 02:35:25.300]  Well, now we have all those videos confirming it.
[02:35:25.800 --> 02:35:33.368]  But when you get these guys on the street as human beings, I don't want to get into it, but I know quite a few people at Fox.
[02:35:33.428 --> 02:35:34.189]  I'll just leave it at that.
[02:35:35.370 --> 02:35:40.095]  And most of them know that 9-11 is an inside job.
[02:35:41.294 --> 02:35:45.755]  You've got cowards like Sean Hannity who enjoys selling the lies.
[02:35:47.475 --> 02:35:50.936]  Beck has demonized 9-11 truth viciously and seems to enjoy it.
[02:35:52.237 --> 02:35:57.538]  But now, how is he going to do that if he's talking about Obama might blow up federal buildings?
[02:35:57.618 --> 02:36:06.340]  I mean, you know, how can he talk about something that's a real threat because Democratic strategists are talking about it openly, like we don't exist and we don't see it?
[02:36:07.240 --> 02:36:21.829]  Bob, you were getting into some of the things that are happening and how we could really investigate this and, you know, really start going and talking to the controlled demolition companies, going and confronting Giuliani, you know, really going to the people that we know are covering up.
[02:36:24.190 --> 02:36:29.634]  Well, yeah, it's just, it, I mean, that's, like I said on the show, 37 is step one.
[02:36:30.362 --> 02:36:41.889]  You know, if anybody, if you're talking about anything, it is impossible, and that's, there's no if, and but, impossible, that a building, a steel building, can come down in free fall.
[02:36:42.689 --> 02:36:44.870]  So therefore, the whole story is off.
[02:36:45.271 --> 02:36:46.171]  Everyone's lied.
[02:36:46.691 --> 02:36:54.416]  So then you take, alright, so, we have, you know, we have an investigation, and you just, step one, go to demolition people, bring them into a trial.
[02:36:55.149 --> 02:36:57.230]  And Juliana, his actions that day.
[02:36:57.570 --> 02:37:05.292]  Jerry Hauer, picking up the security, the security firm which handled security that day.
[02:37:05.712 --> 02:37:08.872]  And he just keeps going from there to there, and he goes to both towers.
[02:37:09.433 --> 02:37:15.154]  And when we prove it's a controlled demolition, which is so easy to do, you can't argue impossible.
[02:37:15.434 --> 02:37:23.316]  When you have a science, a mechanical engineer on TV saying, it's impossible for steel to bend like that without resistance.
[02:37:24.025 --> 02:37:25.206]  Well, you can't argue that.
[02:37:25.646 --> 02:37:28.349]  That's why they won't have you on TV.
[02:37:28.769 --> 02:37:29.950]  Because what are you going to say?
[02:37:30.390 --> 02:37:34.194]  And you look at the films, you've got to be an idiot to know that that's a controlled demolition.
[02:37:35.387 --> 02:37:39.790]  The only person ever to get on with Hannity was Governor Ventura, and he was in person with him.
[02:37:39.810 --> 02:37:40.350]  Right.
[02:37:40.730 --> 02:37:43.832]  And I don't think he was intimidated by Ventura's size.
[02:37:43.892 --> 02:37:50.876]  He was intimidated by the gravitas of Ventura going, look, I was in underwater demolition.
[02:37:51.296 --> 02:37:52.757]  They blew those buildings up.
[02:37:52.797 --> 02:37:53.798]  It fell free fall.
[02:37:54.861 --> 02:38:01.928]  And there's Hannity who's always talking about his houses and his Rolexes and how much he loves money.
[02:38:02.289 --> 02:38:07.834]  Well, I hope you enjoy that money when you go to hell, buddy, because that's where traders go.
[02:38:08.515 --> 02:38:13.440]  And, you know, I hope that gold is worth it when you go to Hades or 20 pieces of silver.
[02:38:13.861 --> 02:38:15.502]  Now, it's never too late, Hannity.
[02:38:16.383 --> 02:38:22.467]  And Beck and others who've persecuted 9-11 Truth to turn around and tell the truth.
[02:38:22.607 --> 02:38:25.509]  Even if you lose everything you've got, you'll have your integrity.
[02:38:26.470 --> 02:38:30.913]  But look, that's why I have a feeling of satisfaction.
[02:38:30.953 --> 02:38:32.614]  I mean, I've had laryngitis for two weeks.
[02:38:33.655 --> 02:38:34.695]  I'm very sick today.
[02:38:35.036 --> 02:38:35.776]  It's gotten worse.
[02:38:36.557 --> 02:38:37.397]  I can hardly talk.
[02:38:37.437 --> 02:38:39.919]  I have to focus every second just to not start coughing.
[02:38:42.980 --> 02:38:46.345]  I don't want sympathy or a thousand phone calls with the cures I should use.
[02:38:47.627 --> 02:38:51.934]  The issue is I'm here because this is important.
[02:38:51.994 --> 02:38:54.939]  I mean, wild horses couldn't drag me away
[02:38:56.229 --> 02:38:57.390]  From this information.
[02:38:57.890 --> 02:39:01.572]  Because I know we're having victory and I know that resistance is victory.
[02:39:01.932 --> 02:39:12.358]  When you've got the truth, even if you're outnumbered 100 to 1, as the Texas Rangers said, the founder of the Texas Rangers, a man in the wrong can't stand up against a man in the right.
[02:39:14.559 --> 02:39:15.659]  You can't just be right.
[02:39:15.739 --> 02:39:19.101]  You've got to just keep coming and not care what people say about you.
[02:39:19.421 --> 02:39:21.022]  When you've got the truth, you're going to win.
[02:39:21.362 --> 02:39:23.123]  Bob McIlvain, God bless you.
[02:39:23.143 --> 02:39:26.344]  People need to get behind the buildingwhat.org campaign.
[02:39:27.365 --> 02:39:28.245]  Keep it up, my friend.
[02:39:28.265 --> 02:39:29.806]  We're going to get justice.
[02:39:30.566 --> 02:39:31.287]  Thank you so much.
[02:39:31.327 --> 02:39:31.807]  There he goes.
[02:39:33.047 --> 02:39:33.748]  You too, my friend.
[02:39:34.308 --> 02:39:35.068]  What a great soul.
[02:39:35.108 --> 02:39:37.049]  What a great spirit, Bob McIlvain.
[02:39:39.821 --> 02:39:42.783]  But that said, I may have to take off some days this week.
[02:39:42.803 --> 02:39:45.064]  I just need to lay in bed and get over this.
[02:39:46.305 --> 02:39:50.128]  The thing is, almost everybody in the office has been sick for weeks with this chest thing.
[02:39:51.369 --> 02:39:55.511]  And I was talking to one of the crew, it was a party this weekend, and they said half the people there couldn't breathe.
[02:39:56.532 --> 02:40:00.494]  And it just, I'm somebody who doesn't get sick maybe once every two years or something.
[02:40:01.235 --> 02:40:03.917]  And it just does not go away.
[02:40:07.247 --> 02:40:11.288]  Your diaphragm gets super sore because you've been coughing so much and you can't sleep at night?
[02:40:12.168 --> 02:40:21.251]  I'm not complaining, I just... I dread this interrogation I'm gonna get in a couple days from a big national magazine with a big cover story they're doing.
[02:40:22.352 --> 02:40:26.713]  Because if I don't get some sleep, I'm gonna be dumber than a box of rocks.
[02:40:28.169 --> 02:40:33.755]  So I am operating here in the last two weeks with very little sleep, because you wake up coughing like the devil.
[02:40:34.195 --> 02:40:35.997]  Well, you know how it is if you've had a chest cold.
[02:40:36.037 --> 02:40:37.218]  But this isn't like a chest cold.
[02:40:37.238 --> 02:40:38.139]  I haven't had a fever.
[02:40:38.199 --> 02:40:41.203]  It's just like something's coating my lungs.
[02:40:42.384 --> 02:40:43.325]  All right, now I'm whining.
[02:40:44.045 --> 02:40:45.247]  Let's get into the big news.
[02:40:45.307 --> 02:40:47.849]  There is a complete collapse of the globalist program.
[02:40:48.823 --> 02:40:49.764]  With a TSA.
[02:40:50.464 --> 02:40:52.285]  If they fail here, they fail everywhere.
[02:40:52.626 --> 02:40:56.989]  You better believe they're gonna find some jacked up crazies to try to get on planes with bombs.
[02:40:57.389 --> 02:41:01.292]  Or they're just gonna put one in the undercarriage of a plane and blow it out of the air.
[02:41:02.083 --> 02:41:09.746]  I would imagine this big counter response to these bullies, these thugs who are trying to train us how to submit, is going to be staged terror attacks.
[02:41:10.226 --> 02:41:18.750]  That's why you can't just expose the grope down, the rape down, the radiation from the scanners and their lies about it.
[02:41:19.290 --> 02:41:26.513]  You've also got to attack the foundation of their fraud that they're our big mommy, our big brother, our big daddy, big sis.
[02:41:27.133 --> 02:41:33.334]  But this article, Big Sis Caught Lying to American People, this is so important to get out to everyone.
[02:41:33.414 --> 02:41:38.615]  It's so important to Google search Big Sis Caught Lying.
[02:41:39.736 --> 02:41:40.876]  Big Sis Caught Lying.
[02:41:41.396 --> 02:41:42.816]  Because she's in USA Today.
[02:41:42.856 --> 02:41:44.077]  They're having press conferences.
[02:41:44.377 --> 02:41:45.457]  They're having to respond.
[02:41:45.777 --> 02:41:48.017]  They're on the defensive now.
[02:41:48.618 --> 02:41:50.018]  And when people find out
[02:41:51.069 --> 02:41:53.850]  Remember just two weeks ago, the TSA said we don't touch genitals?
[02:41:54.570 --> 02:41:56.730]  Even though their own press release from a week before said it?
[02:41:57.070 --> 02:41:58.251]  And there's all the videos of it?
[02:41:58.651 --> 02:42:00.311]  See, they're losing all credibility.
[02:42:00.931 --> 02:42:03.852]  And oh, she says, we do this in a private place.
[02:42:04.152 --> 02:42:05.312]  No, they do it out in the open!
[02:42:05.972 --> 02:42:07.613]  And she says we don't save the images.
[02:42:07.713 --> 02:42:08.373]  Big lie!
[02:42:09.013 --> 02:42:10.553]  She says there's no radiation danger.
[02:42:10.713 --> 02:42:11.154]  Lie!
[02:42:12.094 --> 02:42:12.714]  We've got her!
[02:42:13.837 --> 02:42:16.799]  This article by Steve Watson is one of the best he's written in the last year.
[02:42:17.399 --> 02:42:19.680]  Great researcher, political scientist, Steve Watson.
[02:42:20.001 --> 02:42:22.102]  PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com.
[02:42:22.442 --> 02:42:27.765]  And then Jaron shows me another video from two years ago, a local newscast.
[02:42:28.225 --> 02:42:29.506]  And this is why this is going to fail.
[02:42:29.726 --> 02:42:33.729]  There's a lot of petty media people that when their ox gets gored, they're going to get angry.
[02:42:34.389 --> 02:42:37.310]  And that's what's happening with Chicago Tribune and New York Times writers.
[02:42:37.770 --> 02:42:40.430]  You know, some man grabs and squeezes.
[02:42:40.450 --> 02:42:42.351]  Let me make sure that isn't a bomb.
[02:42:42.391 --> 02:42:44.691]  It's like they're, you know, handling grapefruit or something.
[02:42:44.711 --> 02:42:45.812]  Let me see if this is ripe.
[02:42:45.872 --> 02:42:47.112]  I mean, they really squeeze.
[02:42:47.792 --> 02:42:54.093]  Look, nobody, no, I'm not going through your scanner and nobody is putting their hands on my genitals.
[02:42:54.413 --> 02:42:57.614]  And they admit that they want to phase in scanning for everyone.
[02:42:58.114 --> 02:42:58.934]  That's admitted.
[02:42:58.994 --> 02:42:59.955]  Don't you understand?
[02:43:00.395 --> 02:43:01.395]  Of course I'm angry.
[02:43:02.665 --> 02:43:03.125]  Of course!
[02:43:03.646 --> 02:43:10.950]  I want to fly, like I've done a couple times, to the Caribbean and go snorkeling and scuba diving for a week.
[02:43:11.331 --> 02:43:12.231]  Can't do it!
[02:43:13.012 --> 02:43:16.854]  Can't take my children to Disneyland or Disney World.
[02:43:18.155 --> 02:43:22.618]  I can't fly, you know, to Monument Valley and show them, you know, how beautiful that is.
[02:43:23.078 --> 02:43:24.839]  I'm having my mobility shut down.
[02:43:24.879 --> 02:43:25.860]  This is by design.
[02:43:27.801 --> 02:43:28.702]  Oh, it gives me a headache.
[02:43:32.813 --> 02:43:34.414]  This video is a shocker.
[02:43:34.494 --> 02:43:35.094]  It's shocker.
[02:43:35.155 --> 02:43:37.716]  TSA has been molesting children for years.
[02:43:38.677 --> 02:43:39.537]  And that's what this is.
[02:43:39.938 --> 02:43:42.059]  Anybody else did this in a park, you go to jail.
[02:43:42.339 --> 02:43:43.480]  Here's the short newscast.
[02:43:44.468 --> 02:43:46.130]  Did you get a reaction from that video?
[02:43:46.470 --> 02:43:47.391]  Well, we sure did.
[02:43:47.511 --> 02:43:54.158]  The little girl you saw getting searched against her will, obviously, at an airport, is the three-year-old daughter of our own Steve Simon.
[02:43:54.198 --> 02:44:02.186]  Yeah, that incident led Steve to ask the Transportation Security Administration some important questions, and the answers can help all of us, frankly.
[02:44:02.466 --> 02:44:06.150]  Steve is here, and it was probably tough on you, but for Mandy, it had to have been frantic.
[02:44:06.350 --> 02:44:07.391]  She was a little bit scared, yeah.
[02:44:07.671 --> 02:44:09.452]  But also a little bit cranky, as well.
[02:44:09.472 --> 02:44:10.272]  She's okay tonight.
[02:44:10.292 --> 02:44:10.692]  She's three.
[02:44:11.012 --> 02:44:11.892]  Yeah, she's three years old.
[02:44:11.932 --> 02:44:20.735]  But first, I want to make it very clear, and I understand, I want to let you know, that there has to be some sacrifice and some balance when it comes to security at the airport.
[02:44:21.035 --> 02:44:21.475]  Hit pause.
[02:44:22.315 --> 02:44:27.677]  So we have to grovel to the minimum wage people grabbing the little girl's rear end and legs.
[02:44:28.337 --> 02:44:29.258]  This is two years ago.
[02:44:30.218 --> 02:44:31.338]  No, it's a fraud!
[02:44:31.538 --> 02:44:33.459]  They know it's a fraud to make pilots do it!
[02:44:34.420 --> 02:44:39.763]  If you don't trust a pilot to have no security check, he shouldn't be flying the stinking airplane.
[02:44:39.803 --> 02:44:40.343]  Come on!
[02:44:42.365 --> 02:44:46.767]  Every time they quote the underwear bomber, the State Department was ordered to get him on the plane.
[02:44:47.267 --> 02:44:48.288]  It was all staged.
[02:44:48.948 --> 02:44:49.309]  Okay?
[02:44:49.709 --> 02:44:50.849]  And I know I keep repeating that.
[02:44:51.170 --> 02:44:52.690]  It's all a fraud!
[02:44:52.971 --> 02:44:53.671]  We're done!
[02:44:54.271 --> 02:44:56.132]  So this guy's little girl's getting grabbed.
[02:44:57.173 --> 02:44:59.915]  Listen, people have these instincts for a reason.
[02:45:01.004 --> 02:45:05.409]  My daughters, when men are around they don't know, a plumber or whatever, they get quiet.
[02:45:06.410 --> 02:45:10.054]  If I try to introduce them to people, especially men, they get quiet.
[02:45:10.374 --> 02:45:12.836]  Even though they're rambunctious and wild with people they know.
[02:45:13.457 --> 02:45:14.498]  That's an instinct.
[02:45:15.459 --> 02:45:20.224]  That's like a little dog, when a big dog comes in the room, a little puppy will go get underneath something.
[02:45:20.504 --> 02:45:21.465]  That's an instinct.
[02:45:22.346 --> 02:45:22.627]  Okay?
[02:45:24.625 --> 02:45:26.566]  So, oh, his daughter was a little cranky.
[02:45:27.186 --> 02:45:29.167]  There's a person grabbing all of her.
[02:45:29.527 --> 02:45:30.547]  It's scaring her.
[02:45:30.867 --> 02:45:32.028]  It's out in front of people.
[02:45:32.228 --> 02:45:34.009]  This child has a normal instinct.
[02:45:35.229 --> 02:45:38.670]  Look, you're not going to brutalize and psychologically damage my children.
[02:45:38.991 --> 02:45:39.531]  You understand?
[02:45:40.782 --> 02:45:42.804]  And they want to have mobile checkpoints to do this.
[02:45:42.844 --> 02:45:43.824]  They want to take blood.
[02:45:44.105 --> 02:45:45.386]  They want in your life.
[02:45:45.726 --> 02:45:47.007]  They suck off of us!
[02:45:47.247 --> 02:45:49.169]  They want to buffalo us and break us!
[02:45:49.869 --> 02:45:51.130]  And it's not gonna happen!
[02:45:51.611 --> 02:45:55.714]  Get it through your self-centered, full-of-yourself, government-thug, police state head.
[02:45:56.074 --> 02:45:57.515]  Your bosses are the terrorists.
[02:45:57.555 --> 02:45:58.316]  Let's finish the clip.
[02:45:59.017 --> 02:46:00.718]  I came home from that trip recently.
[02:46:00.758 --> 02:46:03.040]  That balance just didn't feel right.
[02:46:05.174 --> 02:46:10.080]  Let's face it, kids, airports, and security can be a tough mix.
[02:46:10.260 --> 02:46:11.742]  It's a big pain in the butt.
[02:46:11.762 --> 02:46:21.274]  And last month at the airport in Chattanooga, Tennessee, my three-year-old daughter Mandy went from this happy little girl to this during an ordeal through security.
[02:46:25.348 --> 02:46:27.810]  My cell phone has about 17 seconds of this.
[02:46:28.031 --> 02:46:34.076]  Here, a TSA employee we've decided not to show is patting down Mandy while my wife holds her.
[02:46:34.537 --> 02:46:36.899]  First, they tried a handheld metal detector.
[02:46:36.919 --> 02:46:38.320]  Mandy was not in the mood.
[02:46:38.660 --> 02:46:43.605]  And a TSA employee, well, in my opinion, did not know how to communicate to her.
[02:46:45.073 --> 02:46:50.657]  All of this started after Mandy's teddy bear was taken away for screening through the X-ray.
[02:46:50.877 --> 02:46:56.262]  And that started the crime, which meant Mandy had a tough time going through one of those metal detectors.
[02:46:56.922 --> 02:46:59.144]  It also meant the alarm went off twice.
[02:47:00.445 --> 02:47:07.851]  And TSA officials tell me when that alarm goes off twice, everyone, no matter how old you are, must be hand-searched.
[02:47:10.669 --> 02:47:12.470]  But did it have to be like this?
[02:47:12.850 --> 02:47:14.430]  Is there a better way?
[02:47:14.810 --> 02:47:27.573]  In reality, what we as an agency should be doing, or employees, is looking at that child with a little bit of difference in how we handle the child.
[02:47:27.774 --> 02:47:36.756]  James Marchand with the TSA would not comment specifically on this cell phone video, but he says some TSA screeners should follow some advice.
[02:47:37.296 --> 02:47:40.417]  You try to make it as best you can for that child to come through.
[02:47:40.437 --> 02:47:41.518]  Oh, this is sick.
[02:47:41.618 --> 02:47:43.839]  I can't watch anymore.
[02:47:44.039 --> 02:47:44.759]  That's it.
[02:47:45.299 --> 02:47:45.979]  No more.
[02:47:46.059 --> 02:47:48.400]  It's up on Prison Planet and InfoWars if you want to see it.
[02:47:49.021 --> 02:47:52.062]  But the issue here is, this has been going on for a long time.
[02:47:52.422 --> 02:47:54.703]  Now we're waking up to it and saying no.
[02:47:56.684 --> 02:47:57.644]  That's all that's happening.
[02:47:57.864 --> 02:48:04.907]  I'm going to skip this final break because I've got to get into the economy and the plunging dollar and their attempts to manipulate gold and silver.
[02:48:06.534 --> 02:48:09.656]  Also, wouldn't be able to do this radio show without our sponsors.
[02:48:10.977 --> 02:48:21.245]  And one of them is this awesome new knife, and they've, for self-defense, and they've got a video up on their website, theultimatenife.com.
[02:48:21.945 --> 02:48:30.611]  It's the Fox Karambit, and it's form-fitted and beveled to be the most comfortable knife ever held, and it's about half the price of similar knives.
[02:48:30.671 --> 02:48:33.814]  In fact, I found this knife for almost double on many other sites.
[02:48:34.554 --> 02:48:34.854]  I don't know.
[02:48:57.665 --> 02:49:03.787]  And there's banners up at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, but I suggest you go watch the video.
[02:49:03.807 --> 02:49:05.668]  They've also got a training knife on there.
[02:49:05.688 --> 02:49:07.409]  If you get the knife, you need to learn how to use it.
[02:49:08.189 --> 02:49:12.610]  Continuing, one other great sponsor that's made the broadcast possible.
[02:49:13.071 --> 02:49:19.873]  That's Food Production Systems for Backyard or Small Farm DVD video with bonus resources CD.
[02:49:20.453 --> 02:49:21.814]  I've been sent a lot of these.
[02:49:22.714 --> 02:49:23.635]  And this is so good.
[02:49:23.675 --> 02:49:28.280]  Starting in a few weeks, we're going to be carrying on the online video bookstore shopping cart at InfoWars.com.
[02:49:28.660 --> 02:49:30.262]  But they're also going to continue to be a sponsor.
[02:49:31.163 --> 02:49:35.848]  And I think you should go to www.BackyardFoodProduction.com.
[02:49:36.228 --> 02:49:37.990]  That's BackyardFoodProduction.com.
[02:49:38.411 --> 02:49:42.855]  It's a DVD and an information CD that is invaluable.
[02:49:43.556 --> 02:49:47.038]  How to do it in small backyard areas or small family farms.
[02:49:47.579 --> 02:49:53.363]  You know, the experts on fruit trees, butchering chickens, vegetables, eggs.
[02:49:55.091 --> 02:49:58.692]  Rabbits, dogs, working dogs, orchards.
[02:49:59.412 --> 02:50:01.333]  This is just invaluable information.
[02:50:01.393 --> 02:50:02.273]  It's so much fun.
[02:50:02.773 --> 02:50:07.095]  And if you're a farming family or folks that are into gardening, get it and give it to folks as a gift.
[02:50:07.515 --> 02:50:09.635]  It's BackyardFoodProduction.com.
[02:50:09.955 --> 02:50:12.036]  Becoming self-sufficient, getting back to the land.
[02:50:12.056 --> 02:50:15.037]  It's just so, so incredibly
[02:50:15.877 --> 02:50:43.576]  uh... essential uh... in our society you know i'm gonna talk more about this tomorrow on the show we're going to get some guests on about it but the fact that they're getting hundreds and hundreds of waivers in different waves to mcdonald's and other big companies where they don't have to get insurance for their employees but everybody else does no one can compete against these people it's kind of like big companies get tax exemption but then little companies don't that's why they're consolidating power and it's just pure tyranny i want to get more into that
[02:50:45.251 --> 02:51:01.799]  I also have my crazy economy stack here that I want to go over some here in just a few minutes, but I promised to get to this video.
[02:51:15.660 --> 02:51:16.360]  Excuse me, folks.
[02:51:16.400 --> 02:51:17.461]  Had to cough a little bit there.
[02:51:18.501 --> 02:51:22.203]  I wanted to go over this video in audio for listeners.
[02:51:22.663 --> 02:51:24.303]  Warning, it is very graphic.
[02:51:25.524 --> 02:51:32.126]  This is what teenagers are playing everywhere all across the country and the world.
[02:51:32.166 --> 02:51:34.227]  This is one of the best-selling video games out there.
[02:51:34.587 --> 02:51:37.689]  When these video games come out, they make hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:51:38.629 --> 02:51:41.110]  Call of Duty Black Ops, the latest version,
[02:51:42.785 --> 02:51:45.666]  Shows good guys using torture.
[02:51:46.826 --> 02:51:57.448]  And when I was at Target yesterday buying some socks and clothes for the kids, there were giant end caps in front of the cash registers with nothing but Call of Duty black ops.
[02:51:58.828 --> 02:52:00.629]  And Bush orders torture.
[02:52:00.969 --> 02:52:01.969]  They torture people.
[02:52:02.089 --> 02:52:03.209]  You don't get real intelligence.
[02:52:03.249 --> 02:52:05.910]  It's only good for fake confessions and to scare people.
[02:52:08.610 --> 02:52:11.931]  And what he
[02:52:13.729 --> 02:52:23.018]  Now, now, Bush has come out repeatedly in the last few months, he did again last week, and said, you better order torture, and I ordered it again.
[02:52:23.038 --> 02:52:25.180]  You know, I kept you safe with that torture.
[02:52:29.994 --> 02:52:50.582]  When you look at this, and when you understand what's going on, and how they're bathing us in evil, and how they're conditioning us to accept corruption, and how they're telling us the good guys torture, and then people do simulated torture over and over again, it disconnects them from reality and turns them into monsters.
[02:52:51.022 --> 02:52:52.463]  You know, the bad guys torture.
[02:52:53.427 --> 02:52:55.468]  But that's why the globalists staged the terror attacks.
[02:52:55.829 --> 02:52:57.069]  So they could molest our kids.
[02:52:57.370 --> 02:52:58.590]  So they could teach us to torture.
[02:52:58.851 --> 02:53:02.733]  So they could have dramas on TV where the hero tortures even people's children.
[02:53:03.053 --> 02:53:09.998]  They are turning us into devils to be their imperial army for the world government while we lose all of our liberties and freedoms.
[02:53:10.378 --> 02:53:14.821]  So let's go ahead and play this short clip of torture from Call of Duty Black Ops.
[02:53:14.921 --> 02:53:17.603]  Here are the Americans, the good guys, torturing.
[02:53:17.923 --> 02:53:20.425]  And of course, they're always doing it to stop something bad.
[02:53:20.485 --> 02:53:22.166]  So it's morally good.
[02:53:22.446 --> 02:53:23.387]  This is pure evil.
[02:53:24.488 --> 02:53:27.171]  You clearly don't know anything about Dragovich.
[02:53:29.693 --> 02:53:32.656]  I have nothing to gain by talking to you.
[02:53:37.501 --> 02:53:39.023]  Think about what you have to lose.
[02:53:47.415 --> 02:53:48.355]  We can do this all day.
[02:53:48.895 --> 02:53:50.076]  We got plenty of windows.
[02:53:50.476 --> 02:53:53.056]  Or you can give us what we want and we guarantee your safety.
[02:53:53.336 --> 02:53:57.277]  Of course, if you really punch somebody like that, the jaw'd break it.
[02:53:57.857 --> 02:54:00.618]  I'm already a dead man.
[02:54:00.638 --> 02:54:02.898]  I've been hunted across every corner of the globe.
[02:54:03.838 --> 02:54:05.879]  And if you found me, so will they.
[02:54:05.939 --> 02:54:07.399]  They know everything you know.
[02:54:07.439 --> 02:54:09.300]  They're probably on their way now.
[02:54:10.680 --> 02:54:10.840]  Why?
[02:54:13.490 --> 02:54:15.711]  Dragovich doesn't like loose ends.
[02:54:16.912 --> 02:54:18.633]  I've never even dealt with him directly.
[02:54:19.593 --> 02:54:22.695]  Only Steiner, the German.
[02:54:22.895 --> 02:54:26.517]  What was the nature of your business?
[02:54:26.657 --> 02:54:32.521]  I was hired to help stabilize certain volatile compounds.
[02:54:33.141 --> 02:54:34.482]  What kind of compounds?
[02:54:35.902 --> 02:54:36.623]  Nova-6.
[02:54:36.723 --> 02:54:41.085]  A biochemical weapon.
[02:54:41.145 --> 02:54:42.126]  You left it right to me!
[02:54:48.624 --> 02:54:50.325]  Okay, so there's the brainwashing.
[02:54:50.706 --> 02:54:52.487]  They tortured him, they got the answers.
[02:54:52.567 --> 02:54:53.427]  Torture is good.
[02:54:53.968 --> 02:55:06.276]  That's what tens of millions of youth are doing, and they're taught unrealistic warfare and battle, so they all go sign up to be in the military so they can be shot up with vaccines, you know, the real bioweapon, and breathe the EU.
[02:55:06.497 --> 02:55:08.898]  So, it's just total false reality.
[02:55:09.219 --> 02:55:12.961]  I wanted to shift gears here at the end of this hour with Ted Anderson.
[02:55:13.161 --> 02:55:14.582]  We saw them with the G20 Friday.
[02:55:15.663 --> 02:55:19.825]  Try to drive down gold and silver because it competes with their fiat currencies.
[02:55:19.906 --> 02:55:21.887]  It shot way back up today.
[02:55:22.247 --> 02:55:23.628]  Then it shot way back down.
[02:55:23.668 --> 02:55:24.989]  Then it shot way back up.
[02:55:25.409 --> 02:55:28.130]  There is a battle to drive down gold and silver.
[02:55:28.150 --> 02:55:29.591]  And we've seen this every time.
[02:55:29.911 --> 02:55:31.132]  The trend is only up.
[02:55:31.712 --> 02:55:33.754]  And so people should take this time.
[02:55:33.774 --> 02:55:37.016]  Because I know you ran in and bought gold and silver when it did go down, Ted.
[02:55:38.016 --> 02:55:42.698]  Uh, to get back into the market before it runs back up, though that's already happening.
[02:55:43.078 --> 02:55:44.759]  So briefly, Ted, good to have you here.
[02:55:44.799 --> 02:55:55.404]  What's your take, before we give folks today's silver and gold deals, on every few weeks he issues hundreds and hundreds of waivers, it was 111 last Friday, to companies where they don't have to get insurance.
[02:55:55.864 --> 02:56:02.167]  I wonder if Midas Resources or Genesis Communications Network are going to get waivers from Obama to not have to buy insurance.
[02:56:02.907 --> 02:56:06.691]  You know, I don't know about that, Alex, because, you know, they probably wouldn't do it for us.
[02:56:06.711 --> 02:56:08.073]  They wouldn't help us in any way.
[02:56:08.633 --> 02:56:09.875]  But, yeah, you're right.
[02:56:09.895 --> 02:56:11.817]  There's so much manipulation and stuff going on.
[02:56:11.857 --> 02:56:14.359]  I mean, the G20 meeting, it was just so obvious.
[02:56:15.360 --> 02:56:22.087]  First thing they do is they raise the reserve requirements of the futures market, which drives the silver prices down a little bit.
[02:56:23.409 --> 02:56:26.731]  Because, you know, now you have to have about another, what is it, 0.4%?
[02:56:26.972 --> 02:56:31.655]  It used to cost $5,000 for a contract.
[02:56:31.675 --> 02:56:33.097]  It went up to $6,500.
[02:56:34.498 --> 02:56:35.679]  Anyways, I mean, it did.
[02:56:35.699 --> 02:56:41.664]  And then you've got China trying to raise the interest rates on their own market to drive the prices of gold and silver down.
[02:56:41.684 --> 02:56:49.650]  I mean, it's just this international push to push market prices down in gold and silver to support these fiat currencies.
[02:56:49.650 --> 02:57:00.201]  Yeah, the fraudsters have been trying this for years, but now they're failing because they're playing the same old game, but they're accelerating their hyperinflation, which is a new part to the equation.
[02:57:00.561 --> 02:57:03.844]  Tell folks, we've only got about two minutes left, about the different gold and silver offers.
[02:57:03.884 --> 02:57:04.585]  The number is 800-686-2237.
[02:57:04.605 --> 02:57:04.765]  800-686-2237, Ted.
[02:57:04.785 --> 02:57:05.226]  Tell folks the offer.
[02:57:11.912 --> 02:57:19.839]  Alex, the best deal that I have out there right now are the three videos that you have, The Fall of the Republic, Endgame, and The Obama Deception.
[02:57:20.260 --> 02:57:20.440]  They're $101.
[02:57:20.480 --> 02:57:23.082]  I mean, you just can't beat that.
[02:57:23.883 --> 02:57:24.964]  That's shipping included.
[02:57:25.004 --> 02:57:26.666]  I mean, the silver almost costs $101.
[02:57:26.706 --> 02:57:29.949]  Then with the shipping, it is above $101.
[02:57:30.209 --> 02:57:33.752]  Then a $60 value, three of my most powerful films on top of it, 800-686-2237.
[02:57:33.812 --> 02:57:34.833]  What about the silver half dollars?
[02:57:37.856 --> 02:57:46.479]  Well, the silver half dollar is currently right now at $12.84, although I know the prices have gone up over $15 here recently with them, so that is a really good buy as well.
[02:57:47.520 --> 02:57:48.980]  Franks right now, $3.01.
[02:57:49.040 --> 02:57:51.021]  British Sovereign's $3.77.
[02:57:52.001 --> 02:57:54.462]  There's a lot of stuff that you can get involved with.
[02:57:54.522 --> 02:57:55.863]  I mean, gold did run up today.
[02:57:56.803 --> 02:57:58.584]  It hit $13.7790.
[02:57:59.045 --> 02:58:01.006]  Silver went up to $26.51.
[02:58:01.606 --> 02:58:04.147]  Very strong day for gold and silver, both.
[02:58:04.427 --> 02:58:05.208]  And what are they doing?
[02:58:05.828 --> 02:58:11.211]  The Fed buys $7.9 billion in bonds just today alone, this morning, Monday.
[02:58:11.231 --> 02:58:13.932]  I mean, that's fiat money just coming right into the system.
[02:58:14.273 --> 02:58:17.795]  They can't drive gold prices down and print money at the same time.
[02:58:17.855 --> 02:58:18.555]  It's not possible.
[02:58:18.795 --> 02:58:19.495]  No, they can't.
[02:58:19.635 --> 02:58:20.696]  Folks, I'm out of here.
[02:58:20.776 --> 02:58:24.457]  Retransmission on key issues coming up at InfoWars.com.
[02:58:24.898 --> 02:58:26.878]  Please keep spreading the word about the broadcast.
[02:58:27.179 --> 02:58:28.819]  There's a new story up at Drudge Report.
[02:58:29.459 --> 02:58:33.421]  The illegal aliens in California are all going to get free in-state tuition.
[02:58:33.441 --> 02:58:33.721]  800-686-2237.
[02:58:33.741 --> 02:58:34.722]  Protect yourself today.
