[00:00:04.335 --> 00:00:10.363]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:00:10.964 --> 00:00:13.948]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.161]  Very important broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:24.763]  It is Sunday, the 19th of September 2010.
[00:00:24.843 --> 00:00:39.490]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours and we're going to have open phones for first-time callers, people who have never been able to get through live on air, folks that have been listening for years that have never tried to call.
[00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.751]  We would love to hear from you today.
[00:00:41.811 --> 00:00:42.712]  The toll-free number
[00:00:46.453 --> 00:00:52.294]  It's 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, and we will get you up and on the air.
[00:00:53.234 --> 00:00:59.635]  Okay, we have a lot of important news here today to go over on the economy.
[00:01:00.895 --> 00:01:08.717]  The Arizona Republic is talking about criminal investigations of Joe Arpaio, the sheriff out in Phoenix, Arizona.
[00:01:09.677 --> 00:01:10.737]  We've got members of U.S.
[00:01:10.757 --> 00:01:17.059]  Platoon and Afghan accused of killing civilians for sport in Afghanistan.
[00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:26.321]  We have Janet Napolitano, head of Homeland Security, making jokes about being known as Big Sis, making jokes about Big Sis Big Brother.
[00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:31.783]  So I thought we'd look at some of the things that have continued from Bush and now under Obama.
[00:01:31.983 --> 00:01:33.003]  If this isn't Big Brother,
[00:01:33.883 --> 00:01:34.023]  That's
[00:01:52.191 --> 00:01:53.411]  That's in the London Independent.
[00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:55.912]  Mao, the Chinese say, killed 84 million.
[00:01:55.952 --> 00:01:59.372]  Our government says 64 million.
[00:02:00.193 --> 00:02:02.653]  But their own government says 80-plus million.
[00:02:03.133 --> 00:02:06.714]  But it's admitted on record 45 million in just a four-year period.
[00:02:07.414 --> 00:02:13.855]  And if you look at the policies of Mao Zedong, they're very similar to the carbon taxes and the globalists.
[00:02:14.095 --> 00:02:14.896]  Well, of course they are.
[00:02:15.296 --> 00:02:17.556]  Our government admits they put Mao Zedong into power.
[00:02:17.856 --> 00:02:19.136]  That's declassified now in 1949.
[00:02:21.897 --> 00:02:29.262]  And so to understand the dream scenario for the global social engineers, you need to look at Mao Tse-Tung.
[00:02:29.762 --> 00:02:30.363]  Very important.
[00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:36.447]  It's also admitted our government helped put the head of the Khmer Rouge, Pol Pot, into power.
[00:02:36.887 --> 00:02:41.470]  Zbigniew Brzezinski's written two books bragging about that, and they killed 30% of the population there.
[00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.212]  And of course, he was supposedly anti-communist.
[00:02:43.952 --> 00:02:47.754]  All that matters is they exterminate a large portion of society, re-engineer things.
[00:02:48.094 --> 00:02:54.238]  That's how they wipe out old power structures and put in their new power structures, similar to the Bolsheviks, of course, funded by the U.S.
[00:02:54.298 --> 00:02:56.059]  and British governments in 1917, 1918.
[00:02:56.119 --> 00:03:01.222]  So we're going to be looking at that report today.
[00:03:01.842 --> 00:03:02.763]  There's good news.
[00:03:03.163 --> 00:03:05.184]  Texas sues to block Bazaar.
[00:03:05.544 --> 00:03:06.185]  That's the quote.
[00:03:06.225 --> 00:03:06.965]  Global warming.
[00:03:07.345 --> 00:03:08.226]  EPA rules.
[00:03:09.776 --> 00:03:24.928]  And this is an announcement made by Texas Attorney General, Mr. Abbott, going into the fact that it's all a complete fraud to steal money, that it's based on scientific fraud, and so Texas is suing to block this going in.
[00:03:24.968 --> 00:03:33.074]  Of course, Congress would not pass the carbon taxes, so Jackson and others in the Obama administration are going ahead with it.
[00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:36.217]  They're now officially not calling it a global warming.
[00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.371]  They're calling it global climate disruption.
[00:03:39.391 --> 00:03:40.212]  So they've got a new fraud.
[00:03:40.472 --> 00:03:42.133]  First it was the Ice Age in the 70s.
[00:03:42.593 --> 00:03:44.694]  Since the 80s and 90s and 2000, 2010.
[00:03:44.754 --> 00:03:48.476]  The last 25 years it's been global warming.
[00:03:48.516 --> 00:03:52.058]  Now it's just a thunderstorm is evil and is abnormal.
[00:03:52.078 --> 00:03:52.879]  They actually say that.
[00:03:53.624 --> 00:03:57.167]  A snowstorm, a thunderstorm, hot weather, anything is abnormal.
[00:03:57.547 --> 00:04:01.770]  And if you pay a tax to Al Gore and the central banks, they're going to take really good care of you.
[00:04:02.551 --> 00:04:03.391]  So that's coming up.
[00:04:03.531 --> 00:04:09.036]  Also, FDA won't allow food to be labeled free of genetic modification report.
[00:04:10.034 --> 00:04:12.795]  Has now come out on that front.
[00:04:13.155 --> 00:04:15.676]  This is being reported by Reuters, AP, and Raw Story.
[00:04:16.236 --> 00:04:17.297]  It's got a boil down on it.
[00:04:17.677 --> 00:04:21.458]  And so, yeah, oh, they'll tax you for a thunderstorm, because that's abnormal.
[00:04:21.758 --> 00:04:28.120]  They'll tax you for exhaling carbon dioxide that plants breathe, that plants respirate from, and creates photosynthesis with the sun.
[00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:32.462]  But they won't let you know you're eating a salmon that's got insect genes in it.
[00:04:32.482 --> 00:04:35.683]  They won't let you know you're eating genetically engineered soybeans.
[00:04:36.223 --> 00:04:37.844]  They won't let you know about something really serious.
[00:04:38.404 --> 00:04:39.564]  That's because they're a bunch of frauds.
[00:04:39.985 --> 00:04:42.225]  So that's all coming up as well.
[00:04:42.285 --> 00:04:48.908]  But first, on the other side of this quick break, globalists openly push world taxation and a new global currency.
[00:04:49.008 --> 00:04:51.309]  It's here and it's happening now.
[00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.029]  This is going on now.
[00:04:53.109 --> 00:04:54.010]  This is happening now.
[00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.331]  We're going to break down this all-important issue and try to alert the world population.
[00:04:58.371 --> 00:05:00.532]  On the other side, InfoWars.com is the website.
[00:05:02.042 --> 00:05:07.423]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:05:08.703 --> 00:05:13.465]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:05:13.845 --> 00:05:20.646]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:05:22.566 --> 00:05:24.867]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:05:25.047 --> 00:05:29.008]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:05:31.076 --> 00:05:42.602]  We turned jeans inside out.
[00:05:42.862 --> 00:05:44.363]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:05:44.663 --> 00:05:47.224]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:05:47.544 --> 00:05:53.788]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:05:54.168 --> 00:05:56.389]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:05:56.869 --> 00:05:58.290]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.890]  Got it.
[00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.111]  Others don't.
[00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:07.583]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:07.924 --> 00:06:10.210]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:06:14.606 --> 00:06:16.367]  Thank you for joining us, my friends.
[00:06:16.508 --> 00:06:22.173]  It is Sunday, the 19th day of September 2010.
[00:06:22.834 --> 00:06:27.799]  On this live Sunday broadcast, we're going to be here for the next two hours.
[00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:34.925]  We're also simulcasting the syndicated radio broadcast in full living multicam, multicast shoot.
[00:06:35.906 --> 00:06:44.208]  In video live in color at PrisonPlanet.TV if you'd like to watch the show, not just listen to it.
[00:06:44.688 --> 00:06:49.450]  And if you are watching, you'll notice that I have all these giant stacks of important news.
[00:06:51.030 --> 00:07:00.152]  One of the big ones I'm going to be getting into in the next hour after we cover some other important news and take your calls is state's Homeland Security chief goes into hiding.
[00:07:00.752 --> 00:07:03.053]  This is out of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
[00:07:04.495 --> 00:07:08.499]  And here is another report out of the Pittsburgh Tribune Review.
[00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:12.262]  Quakers anti-war rallies on alert list.
[00:07:13.003 --> 00:07:14.304]  And what are we talking about here?
[00:07:14.424 --> 00:07:17.567]  Well, here's our report from yesterday.
[00:07:17.607 --> 00:07:21.290]  We also reported on this originally and first two weeks ago.
[00:07:22.051 --> 00:07:31.455]  Pennsylvania Homeland Security targeted tea parties and put them on terrorist list and said they may be terrorists because they want to cut taxes.
[00:07:31.495 --> 00:07:47.283]  That was one of the reasons used and it turns out $125,000 was paid to a Israeli company to collect the databases and spy on people and it turns out at the G20 last year they were actually used to create intelligence reports for
[00:07:47.483 --> 00:07:54.992]  Pre-raids on some of the anti G20 activist groups including liberal groups and conservative groups.
[00:07:55.672 --> 00:07:58.275]  And so we're going to be talking about that coming up.
[00:07:59.096 --> 00:08:01.299]  And I want to dovetail it with this report.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.645]  This report is out of the Arizona Republic.
[00:08:07.893 --> 00:08:23.204]  Arizona Sheriff Arpaio's office surveilled political rivals and they say that criminal charges are in the making right now because he used his intelligence unit to spy on political rivals.
[00:08:24.969 --> 00:08:26.751]  I've got mixed feelings about Arpaio.
[00:08:27.692 --> 00:08:28.853]  He is tough on crime.
[00:08:29.413 --> 00:08:33.637]  He's bucked the feds on the open borders and the illegal alien crime wave.
[00:08:34.618 --> 00:08:37.981]  But he has violated citizens' rights, and I'm against that.
[00:08:38.742 --> 00:08:47.270]  But you notice he's the guy trying to actually enforce the law against illegal aliens, and so the feds are suing him, suing the state.
[00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:55.638]  Uh, doing criminal investigations and they've now gone in and gotten sheriff's deputies to claim he was doing things that are clearly illegal.
[00:08:56.659 --> 00:08:58.221]  Now, I've got a question here.
[00:08:58.541 --> 00:09:00.764]  You've got all over the country...
[00:09:03.274 --> 00:09:16.549]  Homeland Security hiring British intelligence, Israeli intelligence, I mean even FEMA put out press releases for NLE09 and admitted in a drill with 14 nations that they had 14 foreign countries in the U.S.
[00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:20.213]  helping surveil mainly conservatives and libertarians.
[00:09:21.154 --> 00:09:22.175]  And it's clearly illegal.
[00:09:23.449 --> 00:09:28.172]  Uh, and, uh, but the point is, why are they going after Arpaio?
[00:09:28.553 --> 00:09:31.295]  This is all part of the selective enforcement.
[00:09:31.595 --> 00:09:37.078]  So we're going to be discussing that coming up in the second hour this evening.
[00:09:37.719 --> 00:09:45.764]  And if your local station doesn't carry all of the show, you can always listen to the streams or the free podcast or the free iPhone app at InfoWars.com.
[00:09:45.784 --> 00:09:50.908]  Or if you miss any of the broadcast, it's all at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:50.928 --> 00:09:52.589]  And of course, Jones Report.
[00:09:53.989 --> 00:10:03.834]  So we're going to be looking at this Arpaio situation versus what's happening in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and other states.
[00:10:03.854 --> 00:10:06.476]  Because it's not just happening in this news report in Pennsylvania.
[00:10:06.916 --> 00:10:19.062]  We also have, in the last two months, three separate Tea Party groups in Ohio were told, you're not allowed to demonstrate, you're not allowed to have rallies, because we think you're a hate group.
[00:10:19.878 --> 00:10:23.241]  And if the government now doesn't like you, you're not allowed to demonstrate.
[00:10:23.761 --> 00:10:26.364]  Now notice how they say, oh, you've got to have a permit to demonstrate.
[00:10:26.784 --> 00:10:29.727]  They turn a right into a privilege, then they just stop issuing the permits.
[00:10:29.887 --> 00:10:31.748]  You don't need a permit.
[00:10:31.788 --> 00:10:35.732]  The courts have ruled over and over again to demonstrate.
[00:10:36.232 --> 00:10:40.676]  You need a permit to block a highway or a road for, say, a Macy's Day parade.
[00:10:41.397 --> 00:10:46.041]  You need a permit to block major city streets.
[00:10:46.943 --> 00:10:55.186]  The police and local city councils and legislatures and the state police and others are all across the country.
[00:10:55.566 --> 00:10:59.248]  Different agencies are always trying to say, we're not going to issue you a permit.
[00:10:59.788 --> 00:11:01.528]  They cannot stop you.
[00:11:01.548 --> 00:11:07.551]  They have literally lost thousands of lawsuits in the last hundred years on this subject and Friday.
[00:11:08.471 --> 00:11:21.836]  On Constitution Day, a federal judge overthrew the particular city in Ohio's block on the Ohio Tea Party for being able to celebrate Constitution Day.
[00:11:22.716 --> 00:11:29.259]  But the reason they were blocking them was because these different private intelligence groups that get taxpayer money had put them on a list.
[00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:33.861]  And this was a mainline Tea Party group they put on a list and banned from protesting.
[00:11:34.401 --> 00:11:37.262]  But you still can't ban black
[00:11:37.902 --> 00:11:42.066]  supremacist, Mexican supremacist, white supremacist, and others.
[00:11:42.527 --> 00:11:45.830]  That's how they always try to set the precedent in Europe and other places, and now in the U.S.
[00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:47.091]  Oh, well, they're extremists.
[00:11:47.151 --> 00:11:48.152]  They can't demonstrate.
[00:11:48.452 --> 00:11:52.456]  Well, once you take their rights, you lose your rights.
[00:11:52.516 --> 00:11:54.418]  It's very elementary.
[00:11:55.198 --> 00:12:02.605]  But the big issue here is, everywhere, government is trying to block people's right
[00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:07.388]  To free speech on the internet, their right to rally, their right to demonstrate.
[00:12:08.749 --> 00:12:13.611]  We're seeing more and more of this and it's getting very scary.
[00:12:14.011 --> 00:12:29.738]  Every week or two I see a report out of the FBI where they're banning British and EU citizens and others for life to ever traveling to the United States for sending emails to Obama at the White House that are mildly insulting.
[00:12:30.138 --> 00:12:31.558]  They don't call for violence.
[00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:32.839]  They don't do anything.
[00:12:33.099 --> 00:12:37.401]  You know, they call the president mild names, not even profane terms.
[00:12:38.041 --> 00:12:39.802]  Because it's a family show, I won't even use them.
[00:12:41.262 --> 00:12:42.702]  But you can pull it up, you know.
[00:12:42.842 --> 00:12:44.703]  Teen banned from live from U.S.
[00:12:44.763 --> 00:12:46.363]  for sending email to Obama.
[00:12:46.403 --> 00:12:48.644]  It'll pull up, you know, AP, Reuters, you name it.
[00:12:49.204 --> 00:12:55.746]  So the issue here is, we're being conditioned to accept an end to free speech.
[00:12:55.906 --> 00:13:05.809]  Supreme Court Justice Breyer last week on ABC Good Morning America said, yes, we're going to probably have a court case soon and probably ban burning Korans.
[00:13:07.952 --> 00:13:09.673]  Bibles or American flags.
[00:13:10.113 --> 00:13:13.734]  Anything that upsets anyone else, you won't be allowed to do.
[00:13:13.894 --> 00:13:15.715]  Well, then all free speech is over.
[00:13:16.195 --> 00:13:17.896]  And we've got the FCC head.
[00:13:18.156 --> 00:13:20.057]  We've got the FCC diversity head.
[00:13:20.277 --> 00:13:23.118]  On record, you can pull up these clips on YouTube.
[00:13:23.278 --> 00:13:27.399]  FCC board member says that they will start regulating speech on the web.
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:32.281]  FCC board member says they will force diversity on the internet.
[00:13:33.441 --> 00:13:35.242]  This is the type of stuff that's going on.
[00:13:35.262 --> 00:13:37.143]  You've got the White House regulations czar.
[00:13:38.607 --> 00:13:50.537]  Who was the boss of Kagan, the new Supreme Court Justice, openly saying, we're going to ban saying man-made global warming, anthropogenic global warming isn't real.
[00:13:50.858 --> 00:13:55.221]  I mean, literally hundreds of statements a month without even looking.
[00:13:55.481 --> 00:13:57.263]  I'm not even looking for this stuff, I just see it everywhere.
[00:13:57.523 --> 00:14:02.567]  I'm sure you're seeing it as well on TV, radio, print, where government
[00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:10.857]  is calling for censorship of talk radio, the internet, and that's because the dinosaur media is dying.
[00:14:11.978 --> 00:14:21.306]  The dinosaur media has been discredited, and so it needs to come in and start using government control to shut down its competition.
[00:14:21.326 --> 00:14:27.852]  That's why we have this dangerous perfect storm of old dinosaur media, so-called liberal progressive media predominantly,
[00:14:28.615 --> 00:14:35.741]  That almost no one buys into, teaming up with government to try to come in and start restricting free speech.
[00:14:35.821 --> 00:14:55.496]  So, if you want that God-given right protected for your right to speak up, your right to write an email, your right to rally, your right to demonstrate, your right to have access to the websites you want to read, you had better support everyone else's free speech, even if you hate it, even if it's abhorrent, even if it's horrible.
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.021]  But more on that coming up.
[00:14:58.041 --> 00:15:12.867]  But this is really creepy all over the country that they've got foreign intelligence groups, private intelligence groups being paid, in some cases, millions of dollars in the aggregate to spy and create files on the American people.
[00:15:13.428 --> 00:15:17.790]  And, of course, every time we get these files going back for a decade, this didn't start under Obama.
[00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:22.232]  This was going on under Clinton, accelerated under Bush, it's now light speed under Obama.
[00:15:22.492 --> 00:15:23.792]  Because these presidents come and go.
[00:15:23.832 --> 00:15:24.653]  The bureaucracy
[00:15:25.493 --> 00:15:25.914]  Stay tuned.
[00:15:46.377 --> 00:15:53.905]  Land rights activists, Second Amendment activists, and then peace activists, and Quakers and everybody else.
[00:15:53.965 --> 00:15:56.808]  Basically, if you're politically active, the government's watching you.
[00:15:57.069 --> 00:15:57.930]  This isn't freedom.
[00:15:58.170 --> 00:15:58.931]  This is tyranny.
[00:15:59.091 --> 00:16:00.552]  Now the big news is straight ahead.
[00:16:00.573 --> 00:16:00.953]  Stay with us.
[00:16:00.973 --> 00:16:01.694]  World Government coming up.
[00:16:02.639 --> 00:16:06.882]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:16:07.182 --> 00:16:07.462]  Number 1.
[00:16:08.103 --> 00:16:11.245]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:16:11.525 --> 00:16:12.085]  Number 2.
[00:16:12.386 --> 00:16:16.949]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:16:17.289 --> 00:16:17.729]  It's true.
[00:16:18.029 --> 00:16:22.592]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:16:22.893 --> 00:16:23.453]  Number 3.
[00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:27.015]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:16:27.315 --> 00:16:31.018]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:16:31.218 --> 00:16:31.759]  Number 4.
[00:16:31.999 --> 00:16:34.381]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:16:34.761 --> 00:16:38.164]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:16:38.444 --> 00:16:38.665]  Number 5.
[00:16:39.245 --> 00:16:43.148]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:16:43.389 --> 00:16:48.153]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:11.732]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.

[00:19:59.176 --> 00:20:00.976]  This information is too important to wait.
[00:20:03.657 --> 00:20:11.359]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:22.982]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:25.342 --> 00:20:27.823]  Waging war on corruption!
[00:20:30.011 --> 00:20:34.052]  Why does the United States have 5% of the world's population out of 100?
[00:20:34.173 --> 00:20:36.533]  Out of 100% we've got 5%.
[00:20:37.694 --> 00:20:39.454]  Why do we have more than half the wealth?
[00:20:40.095 --> 00:20:43.216]  Because we had liberty and freedom and private property rights.
[00:20:43.696 --> 00:20:46.357]  No one else has had it to the level we have had.
[00:20:46.637 --> 00:20:47.777]  We live like barons.
[00:20:47.857 --> 00:20:48.998]  We live like kings.
[00:20:49.618 --> 00:20:54.700]  Even our poorest citizens live better than the rest of the poor worldwide.
[00:20:56.058 --> 00:21:01.800]  And when you lose your Bill of Rights and Constitution, which we're fast doing, most of it's gone, we can still get it back.
[00:21:02.161 --> 00:21:03.341]  It's been taken criminally.
[00:21:03.901 --> 00:21:05.582]  We can take back what's rightfully ours.
[00:21:05.982 --> 00:21:07.663]  As we lose that engine...
[00:21:09.383 --> 00:21:17.226]  We now see the highest poverty rate in 50 years in the United States with new government numbers, and that's even using Cook numbers.
[00:21:17.286 --> 00:21:23.889]  The feds, it's been shown, on unemployment, on inflation, on every level, manipulate the numbers to show it to be better than it is.
[00:21:24.289 --> 00:21:27.431]  Most economists say it's the worst it's been in U.S.
[00:21:27.471 --> 00:21:27.811]  history.
[00:21:28.979 --> 00:21:31.740]  NAFTA and GATT were designed to de-industrialize us.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:37.941]  And finally, Boehner and Limbaugh and all these big Republican leaders are being honest about it.
[00:21:38.001 --> 00:21:38.441]  I hear them.
[00:21:38.782 --> 00:21:40.862]  They're saying the government is run by crooks.
[00:21:41.242 --> 00:21:47.264]  They want to destroy the economy by design to make you dependent on them and to make you poor so you can't resist.
[00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:49.244]  Well, that's actually what the UN says.
[00:21:49.684 --> 00:21:53.005]  That's actually what the Biological Diversity Assessment states.
[00:21:53.185 --> 00:21:55.326]  That's what the head climatologist for NASA says.
[00:21:56.773 --> 00:21:59.055]  Last week, he gave four different interviews.
[00:21:59.375 --> 00:22:05.881]  The White House scientist czar, John P. Holdren, we read the quotes on Friday, saying, we want a post-industrial U.S.
[00:22:06.561 --> 00:22:09.063]  The carbon taxes are to get rid of jobs.
[00:22:09.484 --> 00:22:13.587]  I mean, they're not even denying this anymore.
[00:22:14.268 --> 00:22:15.329]  And that's my frustration.
[00:22:15.369 --> 00:22:16.750]  I was so frustrated this weekend.
[00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:17.771]  I talk about this all the time.
[00:22:18.561 --> 00:22:20.602]  But I've got new info I'm about to go over that's bombshell.
[00:22:21.342 --> 00:22:26.124]  Every time I look at my children, who are innocent and smart and good, I get angry now.
[00:22:26.644 --> 00:22:28.325]  Because I realize we have a tyranny.
[00:22:28.845 --> 00:22:32.066]  Just like if I was Russian and Lenin was taking over, I'd be upset.
[00:22:32.406 --> 00:22:35.207]  Or if I was German and Hitler was coming to power, I'd be upset.
[00:22:35.487 --> 00:22:36.568]  I mean, I know history.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:41.482]  And we don't have to repeat it if people will wake up.
[00:22:42.263 --> 00:22:47.186]  And presidents come and go, but these globalist corporate interests have stated what they're doing.
[00:22:47.206 --> 00:22:49.787]  They're conquering the planet through socialism.
[00:22:50.288 --> 00:23:02.675]  They come in, take over your government, get more than half the public dependent on government, as we've now crossed that Rubicon a year ago, more than half the public are on welfare, or get handouts, or have a government job or contract.
[00:23:02.695 --> 00:23:03.115]  51% now.
[00:23:04.796 --> 00:23:11.039]  And once they've got that dependent group, just like Mao Zedong had half the people on the government dole, they come after the rest of us.
[00:23:12.139 --> 00:23:16.021]  And for every government job, it costs two free market jobs.
[00:23:16.081 --> 00:23:20.983]  Well, you see the government growing, state, local, federal, everything else shrinking.
[00:23:21.063 --> 00:23:22.603]  We know what this does.
[00:23:23.103 --> 00:23:26.405]  And people gotta get it through their heads that it's being done by design.
[00:23:26.665 --> 00:23:28.586]  We're being economically conquered.
[00:23:28.626 --> 00:23:31.107]  Now, I've been on air since 1995.
[00:23:31.147 --> 00:23:31.287]  And in 1995,
[00:23:36.858 --> 00:23:53.712]  I had all the documents that we've covered here about the IMF, the World Bank, the Council on Foreign Relations, the UN, the Rand Corporation, all of them saying they want a world government and how they would collectivize things and how NAFTA and GATT was designed to de-industrialize us.
[00:23:54.273 --> 00:23:56.395]  The Globalist wrote about this in the 60s.
[00:23:56.995 --> 00:24:00.919]  How do you think in the 70s they made the movie with James Caan, Rollerball?
[00:24:01.599 --> 00:24:03.761]  You watch that movie, they're thrown at your face.
[00:24:04.462 --> 00:24:07.986]  Every country is only allowed to basically produce one thing.
[00:24:08.847 --> 00:24:13.432]  So that no nation can be independent, and they're all tied together by a global corporate government.
[00:24:13.852 --> 00:24:16.134]  This is all publicly stated.
[00:24:16.415 --> 00:24:19.478]  If you read Bloomberg Businessweek, they tell you this every week.
[00:24:20.038 --> 00:24:24.143]  If you read The Economist every week, as I do, they tell you it's happening.
[00:24:25.876 --> 00:24:34.019]  Hundreds of articles every week admitting world government, but in almost all of these mainstream articles, they say world government is the answer.
[00:24:34.119 --> 00:24:35.759]  Now, think about where we've come from.
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:51.765]  Old timers, 30, 40, 50 years ago, would read these government white papers about how they were incrementally bringing us into a tyrannical, unelected world government, and they would warn people, and they'd get put on government list, and they'd be harassed, and if they got prominent, they'd be demonized.
[00:24:52.563 --> 00:24:52.923]  Okay.
[00:24:53.804 --> 00:24:54.946]  Now, here we are.
[00:24:55.366 --> 00:24:56.347]  It's 2010.
[00:24:56.687 --> 00:24:58.509]  2010 is long in the tooth.
[00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:10.582]  And every day, I don't have to read the Financial Times of London or Washington Post telling me how great world government is, or how it's the answer to our economic problems, though they're doing that.
[00:25:11.598 --> 00:25:21.042]  We've got the IMF openly saying we must have a new global currency and announcing how they want to do it, and it's exactly how I told you they would do it 15 years ago.
[00:25:21.822 --> 00:25:24.483]  Not because Alex Jones is special.
[00:25:25.904 --> 00:25:31.546]  If I see a Mack truck coming at me and I'm standing in the middle of a highway, I'm going to get out of the way.
[00:25:32.867 --> 00:25:35.248]  Here comes a big truck with its lights on blowing its horn.
[00:25:35.588 --> 00:25:36.888]  I'm not a rocket scientist.
[00:25:37.068 --> 00:25:38.209]  They said they would do this.
[00:25:38.909 --> 00:25:40.550]  That's what's so frustrating about it, okay?
[00:25:42.205 --> 00:25:48.747]  And they've got all these yuppie idiots who their comeback is, well you've seen Star Trek, it's one world government and that, literally, I get that every day.
[00:25:49.127 --> 00:25:51.908]  Or isn't that how humans are growing, is towards world government?
[00:25:52.188 --> 00:25:52.768]  No it's not!
[00:25:53.228 --> 00:26:02.871]  Towards an unelected secretive corporate government that destroys your right to private property and freedom and raises taxes on you to fund them offshore and they're above the law?
[00:26:03.392 --> 00:26:10.554]  That, I mean even if you're for world government and are a big chump, you should know that national sovereignty are firewalls to tyranny.
[00:26:11.374 --> 00:26:13.456]  Just like having 50 states as a firewall.
[00:26:13.576 --> 00:26:17.159]  One state's got taxes too high, you run to the state with lower taxes.
[00:26:17.739 --> 00:26:26.526]  And the OECD and the IMF and World Bank say they want a world government to set global taxes at over 80% like France.
[00:26:27.767 --> 00:26:28.528]  That's all the U.S.
[00:26:28.548 --> 00:26:29.388]  has got going for it.
[00:26:29.889 --> 00:26:33.772]  No industry left to speak of, dumbed down, lowest test scores in the West.
[00:26:34.824 --> 00:26:39.105]  But at least we've still got lower taxes as high as they are compared to Europe and Asia.
[00:26:39.265 --> 00:26:42.286]  So there's still some jobs and investment coming here.
[00:26:43.187 --> 00:26:47.408]  But once they have their global corporate government in place, there's nowhere to run.
[00:26:47.508 --> 00:26:50.149]  So the info I'm about to give you is so important.
[00:26:50.169 --> 00:26:51.029]  I hope you'll take notes.
[00:26:51.429 --> 00:26:55.630]  This story is at PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.com only.
[00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:59.251]  I wrote this in consultation with Paul Watson this morning.
[00:26:59.892 --> 00:27:01.092]  We compiled this report.
[00:27:02.292 --> 00:27:03.933]  They have come out in the last two weeks
[00:27:05.026 --> 00:27:30.361]  And have fully detailed that in the next two months they plan to pass global agreements with the private corporations meeting with the UN and the head of our State Department and the head of our Treasury to establish a global currency and global currency regulations and to establish multiple global taxes including currency taxes, industry value-added taxes,
[00:27:31.405 --> 00:27:34.549]  And more importantly, the regulations that go with that.
[00:27:34.589 --> 00:27:44.501]  So, you've got six megabanks, six, who fund the environmental movement, who openly fund the carbon taxes to be paid to them.
[00:27:44.521 --> 00:27:48.506]  And I've got the quotes here from the heads of the central banks.
[00:27:48.586 --> 00:27:49.427]  I'm going to read them.
[00:27:49.667 --> 00:27:50.628]  Then I'm going to go to your calls.
[00:27:52.236 --> 00:27:57.899]  And they openly state this will give the private banks total government power and financial power over everything.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:04.844]  Now, these global banks have already got control of the Bank of England, the Private Fellow Reserve, and other major central banks of almost every country.
[00:28:05.344 --> 00:28:19.873]  But they've still got to back it up with your regional tax money, and still your Congress, your parliaments, your legislatures have some control, though they've phased out and handed most of their control over being bought off by these offshore interests.
[00:28:20.916 --> 00:28:21.197]  I don't
[00:28:38.271 --> 00:28:51.385]  Systems of control, they're coordinated, they've got the organizational skills, and they incrementally take over your governments, have those governments point the tax money at them, and then just always expand more, more, more, more, more.
[00:28:51.785 --> 00:28:53.527]  So, no more denial!
[00:28:53.928 --> 00:29:00.795]  The Republicans and Democrats have stalled us for decades saying there's no world government, we're already deep into it, but now it's coming out in the open.
[00:29:06.989 --> 00:29:07.909]  Tyranny is here.
[00:29:08.249 --> 00:29:12.151]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:29:12.171 --> 00:29:14.391]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:29:14.411 --> 00:29:19.853]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:29:20.273 --> 00:29:26.515]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:29:26.935 --> 00:29:32.478]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:29:32.918 --> 00:29:36.580]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:41.122]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:29:41.383 --> 00:29:46.905]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:29:47.326 --> 00:29:50.467]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:29:50.888 --> 00:29:52.328]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:29:52.849 --> 00:29:53.289]  It's here.

[00:30:02.662 --> 00:30:06.604]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:30:06.844 --> 00:30:12.868]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:30:13.248 --> 00:30:20.332]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.
[00:30:20.632 --> 00:30:25.195]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:30:27.116 --> 00:30:33.985]  By calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[00:30:34.166 --> 00:30:37.891]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:30:38.427 --> 00:30:44.609]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:48.591]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:30:49.071 --> 00:30:55.353]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:30:55.453 --> 00:30:56.234]  Thank you.
[00:31:03.339 --> 00:31:17.805]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:31:18.805 --> 00:31:22.487]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:23.499 --> 00:31:35.492]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:31:36.253 --> 00:31:43.520]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:31:44.221 --> 00:31:53.812]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:31:54.593 --> 00:31:57.857]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:31:58.518 --> 00:32:01.641]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:32:02.222 --> 00:32:06.463]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:06.763 --> 00:32:07.043]  Number 1.
[00:32:07.683 --> 00:32:10.844]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:11.104 --> 00:32:11.364]  Number 2.
[00:32:11.964 --> 00:32:16.525]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:16.865 --> 00:32:17.305]  It's true.
[00:32:17.605 --> 00:32:22.166]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:22.466 --> 00:32:23.006]  Number 3.
[00:32:23.306 --> 00:32:26.587]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:26.887 --> 00:32:30.588]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:30.788 --> 00:32:31.349]  Number 4.
[00:32:31.589 --> 00:32:33.952]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:34.352 --> 00:32:37.736]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:38.036 --> 00:32:38.236]  Number 5.
[00:32:38.817 --> 00:32:42.741]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:42.982 --> 00:32:47.747]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:48.007 --> 00:32:52.048]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:52.188 --> 00:32:53.749]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:53.969 --> 00:32:58.810]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:10.454]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:16.721 --> 00:33:23.003]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:29.643 --> 00:33:30.544]  It is Sunday.
[00:33:30.644 --> 00:33:31.544]  We are live.
[00:33:31.564 --> 00:33:37.727]  Your phone calls are coming up and a ton of other news, but I want to now get into our top story.
[00:33:38.407 --> 00:33:45.431]  And I want to remind listeners, you can go to the IMF website and go to the World Bank website, the International Bank of Settlements website.
[00:33:45.971 --> 00:33:48.712]  You can go to the CFR Zone website.
[00:33:49.212 --> 00:33:52.214]  This is all public, and this was public 30 years ago.
[00:33:52.754 --> 00:33:54.455]  This was public 40 years ago.
[00:33:54.835 --> 00:33:56.516]  This was public 50 years ago.
[00:33:57.196 --> 00:34:07.751]  But the difference is 15-20 years ago you had to go to the library, a bigger library, a college library, a major city library, to be able to find this and people wouldn't do it.
[00:34:08.231 --> 00:34:10.254]  So the media would get up there on television.
[00:34:11.164 --> 00:34:18.269]  And now the CFR has published reports bragging how they kept it from the public, laughing at you.
[00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:20.391]  It's very funny to them.
[00:34:21.031 --> 00:34:27.576]  They've used all their liberal and conservative talk show hosts to laugh at people and say you're an extremist and it didn't exist.
[00:34:28.137 --> 00:34:30.399]  The difference is, now it's here.
[00:34:30.939 --> 00:34:35.703]  They bankrupted us through the end of Glass-Steagall 11 years ago, as we told you they would.
[00:34:36.443 --> 00:34:42.246]  Their solution is more taxes, VAT taxes at the national, international level.
[00:34:42.686 --> 00:34:50.590]  Now let's go through this Paul Joseph Watson, Alex Jones report that is at PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:53.272]  And it just went up on InfoWars as well.
[00:34:53.812 --> 00:34:54.853]  Let's go to this.
[00:34:55.833 --> 00:35:01.156]  Globalist push world transaction tax at UN summit.
[00:35:02.045 --> 00:35:02.245]  I think?
[00:35:20.038 --> 00:35:25.703]  At this private central bank consortium, which will allow them even more insider trading to consolidate power.
[00:35:26.104 --> 00:35:30.688]  At every currency trade you make, taxes will be paid to the mega six banks.
[00:35:31.328 --> 00:35:32.009]  All public.
[00:35:32.549 --> 00:35:37.474]  This is private corporations that will put you out of your house if they have their way.
[00:35:37.534 --> 00:35:38.355]  They're ruthless.
[00:35:39.787 --> 00:35:40.468]  Let's continue.
[00:35:41.008 --> 00:35:45.191]  Final move for world government and destruction of middle class begins.
[00:35:45.672 --> 00:35:46.933]  Don't say you weren't warned.
[00:35:47.633 --> 00:35:58.061]  Globalists representing 60 nations will meet at the UN this coming week to push a tax on world financial transactions in the name of solving poverty and climate change.
[00:35:58.561 --> 00:35:59.522]  That's nothing to do with that.
[00:36:00.063 --> 00:36:06.588]  Formerly launched as a massive program to bankrupt the middle class,
[00:36:08.399 --> 00:36:10.461]  ...and enrich the coffers of the global government.
[00:36:11.422 --> 00:36:19.889]  Spearheaded by European Union countries, the so-called innovative financing proposal envisions a tax of 0.005%.
[00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:23.272]  That's how it started in England with the VAT 30 years ago.
[00:36:23.572 --> 00:36:23.812]  Now it's 15%.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:31.425]  Which experts estimate could produce 30 billion a year worldwide for priority causes.
[00:36:32.707 --> 00:36:38.992]  As Ira Stoll, editor of Future Capitalism, points out, new taxes always start off small, so as not to be...
[00:36:40.256 --> 00:36:40.936]  We're good to go.
[00:36:58.908 --> 00:37:02.691]  With a global army, global rules, you can bet they won't end small.
[00:37:02.891 --> 00:37:10.696]  Never mind all the issues about whether development aid actually helps poor countries or just winds up empowering corrupt local dictators and their cronies.
[00:37:10.716 --> 00:37:12.137]  Yeah, they're paid off by this.
[00:37:13.288 --> 00:37:24.073]  The call for a global transaction tax arrives in the aftermath of the leaked UN blueprint, which outlines how elitists plan to rebrand global warming in an effort to dismantle the middle class.
[00:37:24.093 --> 00:37:25.113]  That's their stated goal.
[00:37:25.433 --> 00:37:27.014]  They want you under their control.
[00:37:27.274 --> 00:37:29.335]  You think they want you with money and uppity?
[00:37:29.615 --> 00:37:30.536]  No, no, no, no.
[00:37:30.816 --> 00:37:31.616]  They want you poor.
[00:37:32.697 --> 00:37:35.758]  And winds up empowering corrupt local dictators and their cronies.
[00:37:38.123 --> 00:37:46.994]  It goes on, the aim is to limit and redirect the aspirations for a better life of rising middle classes around the world.
[00:37:47.034 --> 00:37:51.400]  In other words, to reduce the standard of living for the middle classes in Western Europe and America.
[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:52.721]  That's a quote from the document.
[00:37:53.422 --> 00:38:07.632]  However, as we uncovered during the Copenhagen Summit, the program of global redistribution of wealth and transaction taxes largely centers around looting the wealth of the middle class in richer countries and then using that money to bankroll the construction of world government.
[00:38:08.132 --> 00:38:18.679]  As the leaked Danish text of the Copenhagen Treaty revealed, the money generated from the consumption tax will go directly to the World Bank, not to developing countries to lower carbon emissions or
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:20.641]  Alleviate poverty.
[00:38:21.081 --> 00:38:22.843]  In fact, actually increase taxes on them as well.
[00:38:22.863 --> 00:38:23.984]  That's why the third world said no.
[00:38:24.845 --> 00:38:30.830]  Under the terms of this proposal, poorer countries will not simply be handed the money pillaged from richer nations.
[00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:38.977]  Instead, they will be forced to accept green loans, which actually shut down their industry, in the name of combating climate change.
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:49.982]  A policy that would land the already financial devastated third world with even more debt payable to globalist institutions such as the IMF.
[00:38:50.702 --> 00:38:58.784]  Even if you accept the global institutions who have proven to be completely corrupt time and time again should be empowered to steal from the rich and give to the poor.
[00:38:58.844 --> 00:39:02.205]  These are the same global six banks that created the derivatives and got bailed out.
[00:39:02.705 --> 00:39:04.566]  These proposals don't even do that.
[00:39:04.966 --> 00:39:18.271]  This is all about bankrolling the expansion of world government and creating a giant slush fund that will be used to coerce smaller countries into allowing themselves to be ruled and regulated by a global bureaucracy funded by increased...
[00:39:18.951 --> 00:39:20.792]  Destitute taxpayers in the West.
[00:39:21.592 --> 00:39:29.936]  We warned that globalists were embarking on a global financial transaction tax back in December, when Lord Monckton obtained the draft proposal for the Copenhagen Summit.
[00:39:30.356 --> 00:39:43.442]  As Monckton revealed at the time, the endgame is to quote, tax the American economy to the extent of 2% of GDP, to impose a further tax of 2% on every financial transaction, that'll also track it, they admit that,
[00:39:43.902 --> 00:39:44.142]  I think?
[00:40:03.439 --> 00:40:20.012]  That a world government is preparing to plunder the West by enforcing a myriad of different global consumption taxes for financial levies to a carbon tax which will do absolutely nothing to address the real environmental issues and will be solely used to expand the power of the World Bank and the IMF and the UN.
[00:40:21.391 --> 00:40:30.900]  Allied to the global tax assault is the newly published, this is published by them, IMF strategy document, direct link in our article, directly to them.
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:32.722]  You'll be on the IMF website, okay?
[00:40:33.122 --> 00:40:34.984]  No more denial, no more thumb sucking.
[00:40:35.484 --> 00:40:36.485]  We were right about it all.
[00:40:36.545 --> 00:40:43.292]  We told you the truth and took the heat for decades, being laughed at by every neocon and every liberal scumbag paid off.
[00:40:45.054 --> 00:40:50.716]  I was offered huge jobs 10 years ago to stop talking about this, and I said no, because I care about my country and my family.
[00:40:50.836 --> 00:40:51.596]  I'm not going to get mad.
[00:40:52.317 --> 00:40:53.557]  But how can you not get angry?
[00:40:53.917 --> 00:41:00.599]  The same banks that created the derivatives and scammed us, that own both parties, are now openly setting up world government.
[00:41:00.779 --> 00:41:03.840]  They've set up private intelligence units inside the U.S.
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:09.162]  to suppress patriots, the main group being gun owners, returning veterans, and people that protest the bankers.
[00:41:09.602 --> 00:41:10.443]  I'm sorry, I'm going to stop.
[00:41:10.463 --> 00:41:11.043]  I apologize.
[00:41:12.705 --> 00:41:13.545]  Welcome back to the article.
[00:41:13.846 --> 00:41:15.626]  Look, if you're not angry, something's wrong with you.
[00:41:15.646 --> 00:41:16.767]  You're going into bondage.
[00:41:18.808 --> 00:41:32.914]  Allied to the global tax is a newly published IMF strategy document that calls for the implementation of a global currency called the Bancor, where they just create unending trillions for themselves that we've got to back up with tax money.
[00:41:32.934 --> 00:41:35.075]  I'm about to read the quote here in a minute from them.
[00:41:36.414 --> 00:41:47.303]  Which will be pushed through by means of draconian regulatory measures that eviscerate sovereignty rights of nation states and hand complete economic control to the global economy over to a tiny despotic ruling elite.
[00:41:47.583 --> 00:41:52.507]  The Bancorp will hand the IMF the power to manipulate exchange rates and determine the eventual collapse of the dollar.
[00:41:53.348 --> 00:42:01.476]  Massive resistance must be focused around rejecting the institution of global taxes paid to the United Nations and the formation of global currencies.
[00:42:01.536 --> 00:42:06.421]  Otherwise, the last tattered shreds of American sovereignty will be flushed down the toilet for good.
[00:42:07.574 --> 00:42:09.715]  Now, that's the Prison Planet article.
[00:42:09.915 --> 00:42:13.536]  Every statement is linked directly to the IMF, World Bank, UN.
[00:42:14.036 --> 00:42:16.377]  Every stinking statement.
[00:42:16.897 --> 00:42:17.698]  All proof.
[00:42:18.058 --> 00:42:21.259]  But when Nightline was here a few months ago, I tried to give them all these documents.
[00:42:21.519 --> 00:42:26.301]  They laughed at me and went on ABC News and basically said I was a lunatic with no proof.
[00:42:26.801 --> 00:42:30.342]  They're counting on you not going and reading this.
[00:42:30.922 --> 00:42:31.803]  Do you understand?
[00:42:32.583 --> 00:42:36.445]  They're doing economically what Hitler and Stalin couldn't do militarily.
[00:42:36.985 --> 00:42:42.448]  Now, when we come back, I'm going to finish up on this and then go to your phone calls for all of you patiently holding.
[00:42:42.468 --> 00:42:43.668]  888-201-2244.

[00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:48.491]  But I've got to cover this.
[00:42:49.111 --> 00:42:57.715]  Because when we come back, I'm going to show you how they're pushing everything in this report we did in the mainstream news, but with sugar-coated garbage.
[00:42:58.275 --> 00:42:59.176]  It's all coming up.
[00:42:59.196 --> 00:43:01.457]  And I'm going to read what central bankers have to say.

[00:47:00.291 --> 00:47:00.731]  Thank you.
[00:47:03.613 --> 00:47:04.773]  Coast to Coast.
[00:47:05.134 --> 00:47:06.574]  Direct from Austin.
[00:47:07.195 --> 00:47:10.416]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:18.705 --> 00:47:23.047]  The Republic is on its knees.
[00:47:23.068 --> 00:47:30.413]  The hedge of protection, the Bill of Rights and Constitution, is being dismantled scientifically.
[00:47:31.193 --> 00:47:40.439]  A ruthless coterie of world financiers openly stating that they want planetary government for forced population reduction is in control.
[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:42.000]  I wanted to read to you
[00:47:43.061 --> 00:47:44.024]  Some quotes here.
[00:47:44.626 --> 00:47:50.964]  Here's one by Zhu Zhuang-Chan, the Chinese central bank head.
[00:47:52.363 --> 00:47:53.584]  And this is at the last U.N.
[00:47:53.644 --> 00:47:55.725]  meeting, and they're now ratifying all of this.
[00:47:56.406 --> 00:48:08.653]  A super-sovereign reserve currency not only eliminates the inherent risk of credit-based sovereign currency, but, oh, so now these private bankers can do whatever they want, but also makes it possible to manage global liquidity.
[00:48:09.134 --> 00:48:15.698]  A super-sovereign reserve currency managed by a global institution could be used to both create and control global liquidity.
[00:48:16.218 --> 00:48:20.259]  wrote Chinese central bank head in a paper calling for world currency.
[00:48:20.859 --> 00:48:35.664]  The centralized management of its member countries, reserves of the fund will be an effective measure to promote a greater role of the SDR special drawing right to the International Monetary Fund's first effort at a world currency as a reserve currency.
[00:48:37.685 --> 00:48:40.248]  And what does the IMF publicly call for?
[00:48:40.368 --> 00:48:41.008]  The same thing.
[00:48:41.629 --> 00:48:46.474]  And so when you hear on the news, oh, they're developing a new global currency.
[00:48:46.554 --> 00:48:48.336]  Oh, they're developing new bank rules.
[00:48:48.556 --> 00:48:52.300]  Oh, they're not going to allow what happened with the subprime mortgages to happen again.
[00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:55.403]  It's the mega banks that changed the rules and sold those.
[00:48:56.284 --> 00:48:57.845]  Again, I'll go back four months ago.
[00:48:57.905 --> 00:49:00.368]  The head of the Texas Banking Association got it right.
[00:49:02.025 --> 00:49:06.408]  They wrote a big editorial and said, these are the mega banks that caused the collapse.
[00:49:06.748 --> 00:49:07.549]  They want to come in.
[00:49:07.589 --> 00:49:09.050]  They control federal regulators.
[00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:10.411]  They want to take us over.
[00:49:10.611 --> 00:49:11.452]  Now what's happening?
[00:49:12.372 --> 00:49:16.515]  It's the very crooks that have engineered all this that are carrying this out.
[00:49:17.216 --> 00:49:22.880]  And once they've got their global currency in place, they won't give you credit if you're a patriot, if you're somebody that criticizes them.
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.061]  They're openly saying this.
[00:49:24.081 --> 00:49:26.783]  This is a global financial dictatorship.
[00:49:27.443 --> 00:49:28.264]  That's being set up.
[00:49:28.564 --> 00:49:34.968]  So look at these mainstream news headlines that I just searched the term global bank rules today.
[00:49:34.989 --> 00:49:35.789]  This is what I got here.
[00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:40.633]  Business Journalism reports new global bank rules can be local U.S.
[00:49:40.653 --> 00:49:46.697]  story and says our government's writing its banking rules under the new power the Federal Reserve's gotten.
[00:49:46.897 --> 00:49:54.523]  They got more power out of engineering the crisis to set rules to be unified in tandem with the new global rules.
[00:49:55.103 --> 00:49:57.445]  Because the Federal Reserve is part of this cartel.
[00:49:59.166 --> 00:49:59.807]  Here's another one.
[00:50:00.167 --> 00:50:00.728]  Canadian.
[00:50:02.349 --> 00:50:03.210]  Financial Minister.
[00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:06.072]  Canada banks well positioned for Basel rules.
[00:50:06.412 --> 00:50:08.274]  Basel, Switzerland sets their rules.
[00:50:09.475 --> 00:50:10.056]  Here's a new one.
[00:50:10.116 --> 00:50:10.776]  Greenspan.
[00:50:10.816 --> 00:50:12.698]  Let Bush-era tax cuts expire.
[00:50:12.938 --> 00:50:16.521]  They know when they raise the taxes that it's going to shut the economy down even more.
[00:50:16.601 --> 00:50:17.081]  They know that.
[00:50:17.342 --> 00:50:18.503]  That's what they want.
[00:50:19.003 --> 00:50:20.244]  That's out of a marketplace.
[00:50:20.284 --> 00:50:20.905]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:50:22.145 --> 00:50:22.826]  Here's another one.
[00:50:23.046 --> 00:50:23.927]  Washington Post.
[00:50:24.607 --> 00:50:28.191]  Once unthinkable, once considered unthinkable, U.S.
[00:50:28.271 --> 00:50:29.992]  sales tax gets fresh look.
[00:50:30.633 --> 00:50:32.294]  And they want a VAT.
[00:50:32.835 --> 00:50:35.918]  What is the IMF and World Bank calling for?
[00:50:36.258 --> 00:50:37.879]  An international, a national.
[00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:42.344]  They are trying to set up a world government where they set the tax rules.
[00:50:42.584 --> 00:50:43.685]  And they state all that.
[00:50:43.805 --> 00:50:44.646]  It's all stated!
[00:50:47.136 --> 00:50:50.099]  I can't get national talk show hosts to talk about it.
[00:50:50.159 --> 00:50:51.821]  Oh, now they're forced a little bit.
[00:50:52.681 --> 00:50:55.044]  But they say, we've got to pay our bills to these bankers.
[00:50:55.384 --> 00:50:56.465]  That's of the Lord.
[00:50:56.645 --> 00:50:57.586]  We don't owe this money.
[00:50:57.626 --> 00:50:58.467]  It's all a fraud.
[00:51:00.569 --> 00:51:01.130]  Here's another one.
[00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:04.273]  Energy Department says it has mandate to force market
[00:51:05.322 --> 00:51:18.445]  Transformation for household appliances, even not just deciding what type of new appliance, with their buddies who have patents for it, but if you can even have the appliance, federal home inspections, all of it, under the carbon tax regime.
[00:51:19.385 --> 00:51:23.146]  But they can't pass that legislation, so they're just having the bureaucracy do it.
[00:51:23.606 --> 00:51:24.766]  That's out of CNS News.
[00:51:25.427 --> 00:51:28.487]  So, these are just some of the reports on that front.
[00:51:29.047 --> 00:51:31.608]  And that dovetails with some good news, though.
[00:51:32.742 --> 00:51:48.587]  The UN has gone from 10 months ago denying the Copenhagen emails were even real, Climategate, when we first started reporting on it, when it was just hackers claimed they had it, then it turned out it was all real, to admitting, okay, we lied about the polarized caps melting, they're getting bigger.
[00:51:49.429 --> 00:51:52.211]  Okay, we lied about the polar bears dying.
[00:51:52.431 --> 00:51:53.612]  There's actually more of them than ever.
[00:51:54.172 --> 00:51:56.894]  Okay, we lied about the glaciers and the Himalayas melting.
[00:51:56.914 --> 00:51:57.495]  They're getting bigger.
[00:51:57.815 --> 00:51:59.036]  Okay, it's all a fraud.
[00:51:59.316 --> 00:51:59.957]  It doesn't matter.
[00:52:00.217 --> 00:52:01.458]  The population's too big.
[00:52:01.498 --> 00:52:03.519]  We still need these taxes to shut down the economy.
[00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:07.022]  In fact, guys, I had it in my stack Friday, but I know you already moved it.
[00:52:08.262 --> 00:52:09.203]  Actually highlighted it.
[00:52:09.223 --> 00:52:15.327]  Will you come dig through the stack and find the quotes of... I don't want to paraphrase.
[00:52:15.367 --> 00:52:16.728]  I want to show people the quotes.
[00:52:17.108 --> 00:52:18.149]  And there's a video link.
[00:52:18.169 --> 00:52:24.693]  He did CNS News and two other TV interviews where the White House science czar said, we've got to shut down the economy.
[00:52:24.893 --> 00:52:25.553]  These are quotes.
[00:52:26.294 --> 00:52:28.935]  He said, we've got to have a post-industrial US.
[00:52:29.435 --> 00:52:30.196]  Here's the stack right here.
[00:52:30.216 --> 00:52:31.096]  You can walk in front of the camera.
[00:52:31.116 --> 00:52:31.497]  I don't care.
[00:52:31.897 --> 00:52:32.397]  Get it for me.
[00:52:32.437 --> 00:52:33.618]  I can't dig it out live on air.
[00:52:33.658 --> 00:52:35.959]  I want to actually read those quotes to people.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:36.360]  I don't want to...
[00:52:37.406 --> 00:52:48.776]  Or here, just search the term live on TV and for radio listeners, search the term White House Science Czar or John P. Holdren, knock U.S.
[00:52:48.836 --> 00:52:49.917]  back to Stone Age.
[00:52:50.737 --> 00:52:54.761]  And that'll pull up our article about it, but it has the quotes in it and the link to the video.
[00:52:55.801 --> 00:52:59.925]  I mean, folks, just John P. Holdren, knock U.S.
[00:52:59.965 --> 00:53:00.906]  back to Stone Age.
[00:53:04.339 --> 00:53:06.320]  Please, please, please go look at it.
[00:53:06.721 --> 00:53:08.442]  They want to shut the economy down.
[00:53:08.522 --> 00:53:09.503]  Don't believe me.
[00:53:10.043 --> 00:53:11.464]  Go look it up right now.
[00:53:11.484 --> 00:53:16.727]  I mean, if you don't have a computer, go to the library Monday and do it.
[00:53:16.827 --> 00:53:18.709]  Please find out I'm telling you the truth.
[00:53:18.769 --> 00:53:20.170]  Watch the stinking video.
[00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:27.535]  He sat down with Cyber News Service and others this week and said it's a wonderful thing to get rid of your jobs.
[00:53:30.928 --> 00:53:32.629]  These people aren't going to stop.
[00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:36.492]  The mega banks are waging war against the free market.
[00:53:36.772 --> 00:53:38.654]  They don't like you having a good life.
[00:53:38.694 --> 00:53:40.695]  They want you dependent on them.
[00:53:42.697 --> 00:53:43.818]  Oh, please.
[00:53:45.018 --> 00:53:47.040]  The guys were telling me earlier I was turning red in here.
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:49.482]  I mean, I really am getting angry.
[00:53:50.202 --> 00:53:51.463]  I don't like people robbing me.
[00:53:51.643 --> 00:53:56.467]  I don't like them taking my country over and butchering my rights for myself and my wife and my children.
[00:53:56.487 --> 00:53:57.828]  I mean, I'm mad about this.
[00:53:58.749 --> 00:53:59.830]  And I guess I'm a weirdo.
[00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:00.750]  I'm a weirdo.
[00:54:00.790 --> 00:54:03.632]  I told you 15 years ago about all this and it came true.
[00:54:03.932 --> 00:54:06.533]  I'm a weirdo that I get mad about freedom being destroyed.
[00:54:06.933 --> 00:54:09.695]  I should only care if my football team loses.
[00:54:10.415 --> 00:54:12.156]  And that is why we're in so much trouble.
[00:54:12.196 --> 00:54:13.817]  We need to get serious minds.
[00:54:14.317 --> 00:54:16.919]  We need to get angry and focus and really take action.
[00:54:18.462 --> 00:54:25.347]  Now, here is a report here from WOAI television.
[00:54:26.048 --> 00:54:30.591]  Texas sues to block bizarre global warming EPA rules.
[00:54:31.111 --> 00:54:32.993]  The state of Texas today sued the U.S.
[00:54:33.033 --> 00:54:36.595]  Environmental Protection Agency and a federal court in Washington, D.C.
[00:54:36.975 --> 00:54:46.702]  claiming four new regulations imposed by the EPA are based on thoroughly discredited, hallelujah, findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and are factually flawed.
[00:54:47.643 --> 00:54:48.686]  And it goes on from there.
[00:54:49.047 --> 00:54:50.570]  And so, this is all admitted!
[00:54:50.590 --> 00:54:55.522]  And Abbott's Attorney General of Texas is telling the truth!
[00:54:55.722 --> 00:54:57.125]  They admit it's a fraud!
[00:54:59.451 --> 00:55:07.600]  Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott says the rules are illegal and if imposed will cost Texas in higher energy costs and tens of thousands of lost jobs.
[00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:19.692]  The state explained that the IPCC and therefore the EPA relied on flawed science to conclude that the greenhouse emissions endanger public health and welfare, Abbott said, because the administration predicted its
[00:55:20.293 --> 00:55:23.355]  Endangerment findings of the IPCC's questionable facts.
[00:55:23.655 --> 00:55:32.682]  The state is seeking to prevent the EPA's new rules and the economic harm that will result from these regulations for being imposed on Texas employers, workers, and enforcement agencies.
[00:55:32.842 --> 00:55:34.123]  Well, we got to go further than that.
[00:55:34.143 --> 00:55:47.893]  The state of Texas is investigating and needs to block the city of Austin law they passed two months ago for 2.6 billion Austin Energy admits in increased prices in the next three years on gas and power.
[00:55:48.971 --> 00:55:50.332]  In a new carbon tax.
[00:55:50.692 --> 00:55:55.114]  I mean, Austin just now passed this garbage.
[00:55:55.875 --> 00:55:57.856]  Austin just now ran this through.
[00:55:57.876 --> 00:56:03.458]  And what did Schwarzenegger say at the Copenhagen event last November?
[00:56:03.758 --> 00:56:06.820]  He said, you can pull up the quotes, because the U.S.
[00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:10.382]  won't do this, we're going to go to the cities and states and get it through.
[00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:13.652]  Of course, he was involved in Enron scamming everybody.
[00:56:13.692 --> 00:56:14.312]  What do you expect?
[00:56:14.372 --> 00:56:15.634]  Of course, the Republicans just love him.
[00:56:16.014 --> 00:56:16.975]  Oh, we love you, Arnold.
[00:56:17.015 --> 00:56:17.955]  You're so conservative.
[00:56:18.316 --> 00:56:20.578]  Oh, we love you, Newt Gingrich, calling for carbon taxes.
[00:56:20.638 --> 00:56:21.519]  Oh, it's so trendy.
[00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:29.525]  Continuing, White House has put out a press release, global warming out, global climate disruption in.
[00:56:29.585 --> 00:56:37.993]  So now, if there's any type of climate change, I mean, they're teaching school kids already, this has been going on for years, that any type of change in weather is abnormal.
[00:56:38.885 --> 00:56:42.149]  Pretty soon, you know, kids will say, Grandpa's crazy, right, Mommy?
[00:56:42.430 --> 00:56:47.917]  He says, used to, we had, you know, didn't have seasons, right?
[00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:55.905]  I mean, they're teaching people that to have seasons is, is, is, is, is, is wrong.
[00:56:56.265 --> 00:56:59.027]  Oh, meanwhile, September snow surprises Montana.
[00:56:59.327 --> 00:57:08.174]  Snow began falling in some areas of north-central Montana and along the Rocky Mountain front early on Friday, leaving some people checking their calendar to see if it's still, in fact, summer.
[00:57:08.754 --> 00:57:13.537]  The early snow, I mean, oh, I guess the global warming is going to get us if we just pay Al Gore some taxes.
[00:57:14.018 --> 00:57:15.139]  Everything will be just fine.
[00:57:15.919 --> 00:57:16.979]  Second hour's coming up.
[00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:18.740]  I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:22.141]  I'm going to dig out those John P. Holdren quotes.
[00:57:22.481 --> 00:57:26.623]  We might even play some of the video, where he says, yeah, we want to get rid of our economy.
[00:57:26.943 --> 00:57:29.084]  We want to end the industrialized society.
[00:57:29.404 --> 00:57:39.967]  Find out more in my groundbreaking film available on DVD, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, available at InfoWars.com or download at the super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:57:41.508 --> 00:57:42.210]  You have found it.
[00:57:42.250 --> 00:57:44.735]  The tip of the spear, the front line, and the info war.
[00:57:44.796 --> 00:57:45.377]  Stay with us.
[00:57:45.457 --> 00:57:46.940]  Hour number two, straight ahead.
[00:57:52.551 --> 00:57:56.794]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:57:57.114 --> 00:57:57.715]  Number 1.
[00:57:58.015 --> 00:58:01.157]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:01.438 --> 00:58:01.998]  Number 2.
[00:58:02.298 --> 00:58:06.862]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:58:07.202 --> 00:58:07.642]  It's true.
[00:58:07.942 --> 00:58:12.506]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:58:12.806 --> 00:58:13.366]  Number 3.
[00:58:13.647 --> 00:58:16.929]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:58:17.229 --> 00:58:20.912]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:58:21.132 --> 00:58:21.673]  Number 4.
[00:58:21.913 --> 00:58:24.296]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:58:24.676 --> 00:58:28.080]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:28.580]  Number 5.
[00:58:29.161 --> 00:58:33.065]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:58:33.306 --> 00:58:38.071]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:58:38.351 --> 00:58:42.372]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:58:42.512 --> 00:58:44.073]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:58:44.293 --> 00:58:46.393]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[00:58:49.154 --> 00:58:51.355]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[00:58:55.376 --> 00:58:58.898]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[00:58:59.159 --> 00:59:01.820]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[00:59:02.061 --> 00:59:07.064]  You need to get your own supply of high-quality, storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[00:59:07.444 --> 00:59:13.028]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.

[00:59:15.711 --> 00:59:18.715]  Not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[00:59:19.035 --> 00:59:20.857]  Try their new evacuation pack.
[00:59:21.018 --> 00:59:23.320]  A two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[00:59:23.581 --> 00:59:25.723]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it.
[00:59:25.984 --> 00:59:31.691]  With open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[00:59:32.051 --> 00:59:33.892]  Get yourself and your family ready today.

[00:59:44.477 --> 00:59:51.841]  Again, on the web, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[00:59:53.602 --> 01:00:00.405]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:03.169 --> 01:00:05.370]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:08.791]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:11.292 --> 01:00:12.873]  We're now into hour number two.
[01:00:13.133 --> 01:00:15.694]  There's the article up on the TV screen at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:00:15.734 --> 01:00:17.475]  You can go watch the video.
[01:00:18.075 --> 01:00:21.196]  He says we'll use the free market to de-develop the United States.
[01:00:21.276 --> 01:00:24.457]  So, they've gone from denying that's their plan to being out in the open.
[01:00:24.837 --> 01:00:28.499]  Raj, Beau, Carol, Brett, Carlton, Joe, Scarlett,
[01:00:28.999 --> 01:00:30.200]  We're going to get to all of you now.
[01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:33.462]  The toll-free number to join us is 888-201-2244.
[01:00:34.022 --> 01:00:39.186]  I'm going to take all the calls that are on the board first, then I'm going to get into all this other police state news.
[01:00:39.746 --> 01:00:44.209]  But that was important that I spend the first hour on world government and world taxes out in the open.
[01:00:45.209 --> 01:00:52.894]  So all the naysayers and people who've been in denial, they should apologize to real patriots who've been telling the truth in the face of being made fun of.
[01:00:53.395 --> 01:00:55.936]  But let's talk to Raj in California.
[01:00:55.976 --> 01:00:56.637]  How you doing, sir?
[01:00:59.312 --> 01:01:00.477]  You must be doing super good.
[01:01:02.265 --> 01:01:02.767]  How's it going?
[01:01:03.008 --> 01:01:03.510]  Good, good.
[01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:03.992]  You're on the air.
[01:01:04.032 --> 01:01:04.353]  Go ahead.
[01:01:05.472 --> 01:01:06.273]  Yeah, I had a question.
[01:01:06.293 --> 01:01:09.515]  You know how you said the Bancorp is a global currency?
[01:01:09.535 --> 01:01:13.057]  Are they planning to incorporate that with Cornexo Alimentarius?
[01:01:13.177 --> 01:01:14.838]  Or is this like everything must go?
[01:01:14.958 --> 01:01:15.639]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:01:15.659 --> 01:01:21.763]  They're trying to pass laws where you can't even can tomatoes or pickles yourself and eat them yourself.
[01:01:21.783 --> 01:01:22.583]  You'll go to prison.
[01:01:23.024 --> 01:01:24.825]  There's a House and Senate bill on that.
[01:01:25.145 --> 01:01:30.469]  They've got global rules to control all the food, to not let you know if there's GMO in your food.
[01:01:30.489 --> 01:01:35.392]  The globalists set the rules, then the nation implements them under treaty.
[01:01:37.234 --> 01:01:39.437]  They just tell people it's for the children!
[01:01:52.401 --> 01:01:57.285]  And, you know, they say you're not allowed to sell squash to people on the side of the road because it might hurt somebody.
[01:01:57.305 --> 01:02:02.069]  And they're, you know, just like Lenin said, you can't have your own farms because it might be poison.
[01:02:02.129 --> 01:02:05.572]  So tens of millions starve to death and they dance around celebrating.
[01:02:05.592 --> 01:02:07.234]  That's what sickening control freaks do.
[01:02:07.254 --> 01:02:10.196]  I mean, you like a beautiful sunrise and sunset.
[01:02:10.236 --> 01:02:11.137]  You like a good meal.
[01:02:11.177 --> 01:02:12.138]  You like being happy.
[01:02:12.598 --> 01:02:14.380]  They like enslavement and death.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:15.541]  Anything else, Raj?
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.921]  God bless you sir, I appreciate your call.
[01:02:20.281 --> 01:02:21.601]  Glad you raised that food point.
[01:02:22.061 --> 01:02:23.662]  Bo in Kentucky, you're on the air.
[01:02:23.682 --> 01:02:27.082]  Hey Alex, thank you very much for taking my call.
[01:02:27.122 --> 01:02:29.423]  You have every right to be mad at this, what's going on.
[01:02:29.463 --> 01:02:31.103]  I'm glad you're out there doing this for you.
[01:02:31.964 --> 01:02:36.345]  Well I gotta watch how mad I get though, because I blew a blood vessel out of my eye, but go ahead.
[01:02:37.905 --> 01:02:41.566]  No, that's what a good human should be is a little upset, and that's a healthy thing to be.
[01:02:42.555 --> 01:02:44.317]  Um, but I started listening to you in 2003.
[01:02:44.417 --> 01:02:45.798]  I want to thank you.
[01:02:45.838 --> 01:02:52.205]  You helped me see what was going on and I was allowed me to kind of get independent and be self-sufficient.
[01:02:52.865 --> 01:02:58.411]  And as a farmer, speaking with the last caller just said, I started, they started wanting to put chips in all our animals on the farm.
[01:02:59.491 --> 01:03:08.298]  And by the way, the big farms and ranches are exempt from that.
[01:03:08.658 --> 01:03:10.940]  They have one chip per 10,000 chickens.
[01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:15.663]  You've got to have one per chicken that costs more than the whole chicken, hence bankrupting you.
[01:03:16.824 --> 01:03:18.886]  Well, I mean, it's written by big agribusiness to shut you down.
[01:03:18.906 --> 01:03:19.106]  Go ahead.
[01:03:26.954 --> 01:03:28.314]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:03:30.855 --> 01:03:34.616]  Now I'm at the point where it's thinking when you had that Lindsay Lohan, T.O.
[01:03:34.976 --> 01:03:38.017]  speech that you came out with on the internet, I really took that to heart.
[01:03:38.517 --> 01:03:47.019]  Every time somebody brings up a star or celebrity getting caught with drugs or whatever, I bring up this stuff, this global stuff, and I bring it up and I try to get them to see the point.
[01:03:47.059 --> 01:03:48.719]  Now they kind of call me the cuckoo and
[01:03:49.379 --> 01:03:52.861]  Oh yeah, they love their standard of living dropping.
[01:03:52.901 --> 01:03:54.442]  They love losing all their rights.
[01:03:54.662 --> 01:04:00.285]  Because for decades they were taught, somebody tells you to watch the government like the founders did, they're cuckoo.
[01:04:00.706 --> 01:04:03.487]  No, the smart people like having their pension funds taken.
[01:04:03.947 --> 01:04:11.552]  The smart people, you know, read Bloomberg, where they're taking the dead veterans' death benefits and stealing it, and they say, that's good.
[01:04:13.285 --> 01:04:14.026]  It's a slow choke.
[01:04:14.326 --> 01:04:17.268]  And it's like Al Gore with that frog in the glass of water.
[01:04:17.288 --> 01:04:20.530]  They're slowly turning up the heat and you don't realize you're being boiled by them.
[01:04:21.351 --> 01:04:24.693]  Well, Bo, 5% won the war against tyranny in this country in 1776.
[01:04:24.893 --> 01:04:27.335]  And we got way more than that.
[01:04:27.455 --> 01:04:29.237]  So people that laugh at you, move on.
[01:04:29.497 --> 01:04:31.138]  You're doing them a favor to warn them.
[01:04:31.558 --> 01:04:34.340]  Go ahead.
[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:37.803]  What's your point in 30 seconds?
[01:04:38.797 --> 01:04:43.641]  The Marine Colonel who busted the Globalist trying to take over in 36 or what it was.
[01:04:43.661 --> 01:04:44.342]  He was a hero too.
[01:04:44.402 --> 01:04:46.583]  It doesn't take such a couple good people to speak up.
[01:04:47.004 --> 01:04:47.584]  Absolutely.
[01:04:47.624 --> 01:04:48.745]  Bo, appreciate your call.
[01:04:49.106 --> 01:04:53.889]  Carol, Brett, Carlton, Joe, Scanner, your calls are all coming up.
[01:04:53.909 --> 01:04:53.950]  888-201-2244.
[01:04:53.970 --> 01:04:55.030]  First time callers.
[01:04:55.050 --> 01:04:55.090]  888-201-2244.
[01:04:55.131 --> 01:04:55.571]  Stay with us.
[01:05:05.868 --> 01:05:06.769]  Tyranny is here.
[01:05:07.129 --> 01:05:10.691]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:05:10.992 --> 01:05:13.253]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:05:13.453 --> 01:05:18.717]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:05:19.157 --> 01:05:25.401]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:05:25.821 --> 01:05:31.385]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:05:31.805 --> 01:05:35.468]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:05:35.988 --> 01:05:37.369]  What we've got here is
[01:06:06.158 --> 01:06:09.519]  Failure took new cake.
[01:06:09.559 --> 01:06:12.539]  Some men you just can't reach.
[01:06:12.559 --> 01:06:18.821]  So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it.
[01:06:18.881 --> 01:06:22.302]  Well, he gets it.
[01:06:22.462 --> 01:06:28.803]  I don't like it any more than he did.
[01:06:29.083 --> 01:06:31.484]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:31.724 --> 01:06:33.124]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:35.629 --> 01:06:45.201]  Okay, coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to go through another news blitz of a bunch of key intel on the economy, the police state, and also we did find that video clip from last week.
[01:06:45.261 --> 01:06:49.887]  I don't like to mention something without playing it, because I know folks have trouble believing this.
[01:06:50.488 --> 01:06:53.292]  White House science czar says he would use free market
[01:06:54.551 --> 01:06:56.752]  To de-develop the United States.
[01:06:57.752 --> 01:07:00.994]  It's stated they want to de-industrialize this country.
[01:07:01.834 --> 01:07:05.716]  And his stated goal is to drug the water supply to also sterilize you and your family.
[01:07:06.196 --> 01:07:07.616]  He's written four books on the subject.
[01:07:07.936 --> 01:07:08.857]  These are psychopaths.
[01:07:09.397 --> 01:07:11.278]  But you'll see the video from him coming up.
[01:07:13.387 --> 01:07:16.409]  Just like last hour, I covered how world government's openly being announced.
[01:07:17.170 --> 01:07:21.193]  Again, we're taking first-time callers today, 888-201-2244.
[01:07:21.674 --> 01:07:23.475]  Let's talk to Carol in California.
[01:07:23.495 --> 01:07:24.636]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:07:25.737 --> 01:07:26.938]  Alex, it's a pleasure.
[01:07:26.958 --> 01:07:32.383]  I first want to give you just briefly, like, background on me as a caller.
[01:07:32.403 --> 01:07:35.125]  I voted for Obama.
[01:07:35.305 --> 01:07:36.266]  I campaigned.
[01:07:36.806 --> 01:07:37.627]  I donated.
[01:07:37.647 --> 01:07:41.991]  And I even flew to Washington, D.C., for the inauguration.
[01:07:42.791 --> 01:07:45.073]  Which is a completely other story.
[01:07:45.113 --> 01:08:05.670]  We got shut out and and so forth but I want to say two years ago you completely changed the way I look at things and how I would scan the news and I guess it started with the Obama deception and I mean I just it's
[01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:20.344]  So Claire and you know I'm just a you know average mom and you know I just want whoever is like listening to your show to know that it's not just fringe.
[01:08:24.944 --> 01:08:31.790]  Well, I made the Obama deception while he had been elected, and it was released right after he got into office in late January.
[01:08:31.810 --> 01:08:33.791]  It was released in March, early March.
[01:08:34.552 --> 01:08:40.877]  And we lay out who his advisors are, how the same people that backed Bush backed him, how it was fake hope and change.
[01:08:41.438 --> 01:08:44.921]  Now the mainline Republicans are going to give fake hope and change.
[01:08:45.441 --> 01:08:48.242]  They're going to try to shut out any good patriots that actually get elected.
[01:08:48.262 --> 01:08:50.782]  They're trying to block real Tea Party candidates.
[01:08:51.303 --> 01:08:54.783]  But less people are getting conned by the bait-and-switch.
[01:08:54.823 --> 01:08:59.885]  So don't feel bad for being bamboozled by Barry Sotaro, aka Barack Obama.
[01:09:00.205 --> 01:09:02.846]  This is all part of an awakening process.
[01:09:02.886 --> 01:09:08.107]  As long as you don't get conned over and over again, we can learn from our mistakes.
[01:09:09.582 --> 01:09:31.244]  There's no chance, but I know, I see how they try to make, you know, everybody in the Tea Party out to be a wacko, and I'm not out there waving Tea Party, uh, flags, or- Well, you're counting on people to be empty-minded, and just do what the TV says is cool and trendy, don't be your own self, and- but they also limit all opposition as if it's just the Tea Party.
[01:09:31.724 --> 01:09:34.186]  You know, as if you're a Republican and you're a Tea Party.
[01:09:34.446 --> 01:09:34.666]  No!
[01:09:34.946 --> 01:09:39.969]  Polls show that only 24%, you know, trust the government in any way.
[01:09:40.529 --> 01:09:44.272]  And so, again, the media is trying to limit dissent to the Tea Party.
[01:09:44.992 --> 01:09:45.853]  But it's not going to work.
[01:09:45.933 --> 01:09:49.415]  Carol, what really woke you up to Obama being a fraudster?
[01:09:50.542 --> 01:09:51.303]  Oh, gosh.
[01:09:51.563 --> 01:09:58.589]  Well, you know, I think it was with the collapse and I wanted to know what happened.
[01:09:58.669 --> 01:10:05.874]  And so I started, instead of like watching media that, you know, have them control the content for me.
[01:10:05.974 --> 01:10:08.156]  Oh, their answer is give the bankers more power.
[01:10:08.456 --> 01:10:09.938]  Oh, you don't like what the bankers did?
[01:10:09.978 --> 01:10:11.419]  Let's give them even more power.
[01:10:11.439 --> 01:10:12.480]  That'll fix it.
[01:10:13.942 --> 01:10:18.365]  Well, yeah, the bailout was like, that's a good starting point.
[01:10:18.405 --> 01:10:19.766]  And that was bipartisan, Carol.
[01:10:19.986 --> 01:10:21.247]  Well, so that's what woke you up.
[01:10:21.267 --> 01:10:22.648]  Well, that's going to wake a lot of people up.
[01:10:22.968 --> 01:10:26.931]  And as the depression accelerates, remember they told us, oh, we're not even in a recession.
[01:10:26.971 --> 01:10:28.912]  Now they're going, oh, we never got out of the recession.
[01:10:29.353 --> 01:10:30.173]  It's a depression.
[01:10:30.574 --> 01:10:31.494]  It's engineered.
[01:10:31.754 --> 01:10:37.759]  And all their policies are only going to make it worse because it's a de-industrialization policy.
[01:10:38.692 --> 01:10:41.894]  Mao didn't kill 60-plus million people because he made a mistake.
[01:10:42.735 --> 01:10:45.437]  Stalin didn't kill 40-plus million because he made a mistake.
[01:10:46.157 --> 01:10:48.739]  Hitler didn't kill 30-plus million because he made a mistake.
[01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:54.083]  Pol Pot didn't kill 30% of the people in his country in Cambodia because he made a mistake.
[01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:58.226]  They want to break your will and make you learn how to lick boots.
[01:10:59.107 --> 01:11:00.868]  Let's talk to Brett in Ohio.
[01:11:00.928 --> 01:11:01.729]  Brett, you're on the air.
[01:11:01.749 --> 01:11:04.951]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:11:06.622 --> 01:11:14.350]  I've been awake for about two years, and I thank you for that and being a patriot and protecting my country and my family and my home.
[01:11:15.091 --> 01:11:18.835]  Unlike Carol, I was into the President Bush.
[01:11:19.575 --> 01:11:20.717]  I mean, he had to be a good guy.
[01:11:20.757 --> 01:11:24.380]  He said, God bless America after he had a speech.
[01:11:24.481 --> 01:11:26.543]  But as you learn, or as I've learned,
[01:11:27.492 --> 01:11:28.693]  He was about a lot of different things.
[01:11:29.254 --> 01:11:33.457]  Well, I mean, even if Bush was a good guy, which he wasn't, he's a puppet.
[01:11:33.758 --> 01:11:36.660]  I mean, you've got to look at the real policies, not the rhetoric.
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:39.523]  And everything Clinton did, Bush accelerated it.
[01:11:39.823 --> 01:11:43.026]  Now, everything Bush was doing, Obama accelerated.
[01:11:43.046 --> 01:11:45.848]  I mean, when you and I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:11:46.889 --> 01:11:51.253]  Well, like I said, I mean, back in those days, I was watching O'Reilly and back in Hannity.
[01:11:52.248 --> 01:11:53.809]  And thinking they have their act together.
[01:11:53.829 --> 01:11:54.949]  Like I said, you've woken me up.
[01:11:55.229 --> 01:11:59.311]  And, you know, I've learned now that they would all throw you under their bus for their own skin or their own pocketbook.
[01:11:59.331 --> 01:12:00.191]  At least that's my belief.
[01:12:00.231 --> 01:12:09.975]  Well, more than that, we forced them to admit world government because what are they going to do when the BBC is saying how great world government is and they're openly, you know, having parades for it?
[01:12:10.335 --> 01:12:13.596]  Now they're like, OK, it's real, but we're the gatekeepers.
[01:12:13.636 --> 01:12:17.657]  Don't be too kooky like some of these groups that say a Bilderberg group exists.
[01:12:17.697 --> 01:12:18.678]  This is a quote from Beck.
[01:12:19.238 --> 01:12:20.439]  That's not an issue.
[01:12:20.459 --> 01:12:23.241]  There's a world government, but it's run by low-level commies.
[01:12:23.561 --> 01:12:25.683]  They never tell you it's run by the big foundations.
[01:12:26.023 --> 01:12:28.225]  Or they tell you the big tax-free foundations.
[01:12:28.585 --> 01:12:31.367]  Or they tell you, oh, the Ground Zero Mosque, it's real horrible.
[01:12:31.727 --> 01:12:35.350]  They don't tell you it's funded by the tax-free foundations and the CIA.
[01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:39.413]  Though, Newark Observer now admits that a month after we broke it, but go ahead.
[01:12:41.395 --> 01:12:43.837]  Well, yeah, like I said, it's, you know, there was...
[01:12:44.969 --> 01:12:49.172]  I mean, I was into when they announced, when Bush was in there, that there was Homeland Security.
[01:12:49.632 --> 01:12:51.053]  I thought, well, shoot, I'm okay with that.
[01:12:51.093 --> 01:12:52.554]  I mean, you know, why are you complaining about that?
[01:12:52.595 --> 01:12:54.196]  I'm not a guy that's going to do anything wrong.
[01:12:54.776 --> 01:12:55.757]  Or the Patriot Act.
[01:12:56.357 --> 01:12:59.159]  And so many people, I think, were like that.
[01:12:59.239 --> 01:13:00.460]  And even today, it's like that.
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:08.266]  Because when I go over all this stuff you went over with me, and I'm always passing out DVDs, I spend more time sharing this information with people
[01:13:08.927 --> 01:13:14.021]  More than my regular job now, because I believe it's extremely important, and I know it is to you, and I respect you for that.
[01:13:14.302 --> 01:13:14.643]  Okay?
[01:13:14.663 --> 01:13:15.526]  Well, I respect you, sir.
[01:13:17.194 --> 01:13:22.477]  Uh, you know, I used to think, and like a lot of people did, we lived in this Andy Griffith, Donna Reed world.
[01:13:22.757 --> 01:13:31.701]  And when you find out, when you truly study, and it's why everybody needs to be studying the documents, and when you mention something, they need to go over this and research it, because what you say is true.
[01:13:31.721 --> 01:13:35.923]  You know, like I said, I don't listen to these other guys because they became turncoats.
[01:13:36.303 --> 01:13:37.424]  They changed their story.
[01:13:37.924 --> 01:13:38.685]  You remain true.
[01:13:39.785 --> 01:13:45.267]  Well, I mean, there's a facade of Andy Griffin, but I mean, I've been harping on this for three weeks since Bloomberg broke it.
[01:13:45.507 --> 01:13:50.908]  And I've already gotten calls about this in the last few years, but even I couldn't believe it, so I didn't look into it.
[01:13:50.988 --> 01:13:51.828]  I'm weak-minded.
[01:14:05.982 --> 01:14:09.785]  Nine times out of ten, I underestimate how evil these globalists are.
[01:14:10.125 --> 01:14:11.906]  They're basically unlimitedly evil.
[01:14:11.926 --> 01:14:27.698]  But I remember getting calls about millions of older veterans when they would die, or people dying in Iraq, or Afghanistan, or in a plane crash in New Mexico, it didn't matter, that suddenly their death benefits, their insurance money, wouldn't go there.
[01:14:28.659 --> 01:14:32.902]  And people say that they stole my death benefits, and I said, that's impossible.
[01:14:33.162 --> 01:14:33.943]  I didn't look into it.
[01:14:34.667 --> 01:14:35.608]  Yeah, but I had heard this.
[01:14:35.828 --> 01:14:51.949]  Now they come out and headline Bloomberg, Veterans Affairs met in secret with Prudential, but that's just one, all the big ones did it, to steal the death benefits and the government says, yep, we changed the rule, we're allowed to keep your insurance money.
[01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:55.682]  The sky is the limit with these people.
[01:14:56.342 --> 01:14:58.604]  20 years ago, they wouldn't let the troops use DU.
[01:14:59.104 --> 01:15:06.028]  It was an emergency weapon of the Russians poured across into Europe, and they admitted it would kill a lot of the troops that used it.
[01:15:07.662 --> 01:15:11.886]  But they changed it in 1991 and said it's no longer bad for you, use it.
[01:15:12.406 --> 01:15:15.049]  And the deformities in Fallujah are 14-fold.
[01:15:15.429 --> 01:15:18.973]  The deformities in our troops and their children are 4-fold.
[01:15:19.213 --> 01:15:20.434]  That's the British Medical Journal.
[01:15:20.734 --> 01:15:25.599]  I mean, folks, they tell the troops, use uranium weapons, they're not bad for you.
[01:15:25.779 --> 01:15:31.324]  They tell workers in the Gulf, core exit isn't bad for you, and Obama says, there's no health problems, don't worry.
[01:15:31.584 --> 01:15:35.948]  They tell police and firemen, you don't need a respirator at ground zero, asbestos isn't bad.
[01:15:36.429 --> 01:15:40.412]  They tell, they take the troops insurance death benefits.
[01:15:41.393 --> 01:15:48.240]  I mean, they take Korea, Vietnam, Desert One, Desert Two, I appreciate your call, God bless you, sir.
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:50.622]  I mean, these people, I can't believe that.
[01:15:51.082 --> 01:15:52.603]  I have nightmares over this!
[01:15:52.983 --> 01:15:53.963]  I mean, literally!
[01:15:54.764 --> 01:15:55.924]  They get away with anything!
[01:15:56.104 --> 01:15:57.485]  What else are they getting away with?
[01:15:57.645 --> 01:15:58.666]  Don't you understand?
[01:15:58.686 --> 01:16:00.126]  We'll be right back with more Call.
[01:16:00.146 --> 01:16:00.707]  Stay with us.
[01:16:03.608 --> 01:16:18.055]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:16:19.082 --> 01:16:22.785]  My name is Mario Cifaldi, and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:16:23.766 --> 01:16:35.776]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:16:36.537 --> 01:16:43.803]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.

[01:17:59.539 --> 01:18:01.342]  This information is too important to wait.
[01:18:02.143 --> 01:18:06.388]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:18:06.708 --> 01:18:07.289]  Number one.
[01:18:07.589 --> 01:18:11.592]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:18:11.872 --> 01:18:16.436]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:18:16.776 --> 01:18:17.216]  It's true.
[01:18:17.516 --> 01:18:22.940]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:18:23.221 --> 01:18:26.503]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:18:26.803 --> 01:18:30.486]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:31.247]  Number 4.
[01:18:31.507 --> 01:18:33.869]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:18:34.270 --> 01:18:37.653]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:18:37.934 --> 01:18:38.154]  Number 5.
[01:18:38.734 --> 01:18:42.659]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:18:42.879 --> 01:18:47.644]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:18:47.924 --> 01:18:51.946]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:18:52.086 --> 01:18:53.647]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:18:53.887 --> 01:18:55.948]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:18:56.128 --> 01:18:59.330]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:18:59.750 --> 01:19:05.953]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:19:06.153 --> 01:19:12.196]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:19:12.576 --> 01:19:16.478]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me
[01:19:16.638 --> 01:19:19.641]  How much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:19:19.941 --> 01:19:24.525]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[01:19:24.825 --> 01:19:33.293]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[01:19:33.493 --> 01:19:37.217]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:19:37.731 --> 01:19:43.917]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:19:44.498 --> 01:19:47.901]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:19:48.401 --> 01:19:55.028]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[01:19:55.368 --> 01:19:55.969]  Thank you.
[01:20:03.604 --> 01:20:06.506]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:20:07.187 --> 01:20:11.270]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:14.313 --> 01:20:19.877]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:20:20.337 --> 01:20:22.879]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:27.646 --> 01:20:35.259]  I have made more than 26 full-length documentary films, and none of them have reached more people than the Obama deception.
[01:20:35.279 --> 01:20:39.686]  We've got a deal running for another week where you get a copy of this expanded film.
[01:20:40.902 --> 01:20:53.049]  That shatters the left-right paradigm and shows how both parties at the top are controlled by these offshore banks and get a copy of Jesse Ventura's American Conspiracies, absolutely free and hardcover, $24.95 value-free.
[01:20:53.429 --> 01:20:58.932]  So the DVD and the book, $19.95, and your purchase makes this broadcast and what we do here possible.
[01:20:59.997 --> 01:21:04.479]  Now if you just joined us, I wasn't joking about that.
[01:21:04.579 --> 01:21:18.885]  Bloomberg's had a series of reports where Prudential and others, major insurance companies admitted, they made a secret deal in 1999 with Veterans Affairs to basically keep dead veterans benefits.
[01:21:19.993 --> 01:21:26.155]  And many experts have called it criminal, but the government says, well, we change the language.
[01:21:26.836 --> 01:21:30.517]  We don't tell the vets when they sign up in the military that that's in the fine print.
[01:21:30.857 --> 01:21:33.058]  So because they didn't read the print, we're going to keep their money.
[01:21:33.818 --> 01:21:34.959]  I mean, that'll just give you an idea.
[01:21:34.979 --> 01:21:35.339]  There it is.
[01:21:35.399 --> 01:21:37.740]  Veterans Agency made secret deal over benefits.
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:38.500]  U.S.
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:45.343]  Department of Veterans Affairs failed to inform 6 million soldiers and their families of an agreement enabling Prudential Financial, Inc.
[01:21:45.723 --> 01:21:55.507]  to withhold lump-sum payments of life insurance benefits to survivors of fallen service members according to records made public through a Freedom of Information Act request.
[01:21:56.287 --> 01:22:02.435]  And what they do is, without giving them the choice, is they pay them a fraction of the supposed interest on it.
[01:22:02.756 --> 01:22:04.178]  In some cases, they just keep it.
[01:22:04.538 --> 01:22:08.483]  So you can read those reports for yourself.
[01:22:09.434 --> 01:22:12.115]  So you pay into these things and you get nothing.
[01:22:12.595 --> 01:22:15.256]  Okay, let's go back to your calls as promised.
[01:22:15.776 --> 01:22:21.378]  Coming up, I'm going to play that John P. Holdren clip about dismantling our industries by design.
[01:22:21.858 --> 01:22:23.638]  You didn't think Knapp and Gatt were an accident.
[01:22:24.299 --> 01:22:28.520]  Let's talk to Joe in Maryland and Julian, Scanner, Nate, John and others.
[01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:29.480]  Joe, you're on the air.
[01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:32.221]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:22:32.861 --> 01:22:34.802]  First I want to say thanks for not selling out.
[01:22:36.291 --> 01:22:38.372]  Well, I mean, selling out is a lie.
[01:22:39.332 --> 01:22:43.973]  Even if you think you sell out and join the New World Order, you're destroying yourself and your own family.
[01:22:44.233 --> 01:22:45.734]  You can't make a deal with the devil.
[01:22:48.495 --> 01:22:48.995]  Anything else, Joe?
[01:22:49.015 --> 01:22:51.836]  Yeah, I'm sorry?
[01:22:52.196 --> 01:22:53.156]  Yeah, your phone was cut now.
[01:22:53.196 --> 01:22:53.556]  Go ahead.
[01:22:54.156 --> 01:22:55.017]  Oh, sorry.
[01:22:55.877 --> 01:22:59.258]  I had a couple questions regarding history and stuff, since you're a history buff.
[01:23:00.855 --> 01:23:03.202]  Oh, hey, how about a Ron Paul DVD?
[01:23:03.242 --> 01:23:05.408]  Like, you know how you got the Obama deception and stuff?
[01:23:05.428 --> 01:23:07.896]  How about a pro Ron Paul?
[01:23:08.695 --> 01:23:09.635]  He's the real deal.
[01:23:09.655 --> 01:23:11.956]  Here's the evidence, how we know he's the real deal.
[01:23:11.976 --> 01:23:16.698]  How about something like that so we can get him in the White House in 2012 before we completely go into 100%.
[01:23:17.098 --> 01:23:35.785]  I'm actually, I suspended the two-year production of my Eugenics film, it's coming out in the middle of next year, to late this year or early next year, release a film about the political paradigm, who Ron Paul is, who the fake Tea Party people are trying to make it a counterfeit.
[01:23:36.105 --> 01:23:37.766]  So it's a great idea, we're actually on it.
[01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:39.040]  Awesome.
[01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:41.901]  And hey, so a couple of questions I had for you.
[01:23:43.081 --> 01:23:44.361]  Did we land on the moon?
[01:23:44.721 --> 01:23:46.962]  And was there a Bush Sr.
[01:23:47.042 --> 01:23:48.922]  JFK assassination connection?
[01:23:50.102 --> 01:23:50.442]  Okay.
[01:23:51.342 --> 01:23:56.323]  All the evidence I have is that the technology is even more advanced than what they show.
[01:23:56.863 --> 01:24:03.465]  And yes, we did go to the moon, but they did fake a few things because they didn't want the general public to see the real technology.
[01:24:03.485 --> 01:24:04.545]  And of course, you know,
[01:24:05.615 --> 01:24:10.859]  The B-2 stealth bomber was 20-plus years old when they rolled it out in 1987.
[01:24:11.179 --> 01:24:16.423]  And I know people who worked on the front line of mission control.
[01:24:16.803 --> 01:24:22.247]  I know the guy that ran the RCA cameras on the moon, Raymond Teague, and he's the real deal.
[01:24:23.107 --> 01:24:29.312]  And I've talked to Dr. Bob Bowman, the former head of the Star Wars program, and he says, well, it's classified, but
[01:24:29.952 --> 01:24:38.615]  You're right on target with, they've got a semi-fake space program, not because they don't have the technology, but because they don't let the public know what they've really got.
[01:24:41.356 --> 01:24:42.317]  Does that answer your question?
[01:24:42.884 --> 01:25:07.806]  Yeah, how about the... because there's a memo out on the internet, I don't know if it's fake or not, but... No, there's a real memo that a George Herbert Walker Bush was in the CIA, and was in Texas, and he was photographed in Daly Plaza, and of course they claim he had just joined the CIA in the 70s to be the director out of nowhere, but of course he went to skull and bones at Yale that founded the CIA, that's on record, and of course he was CIA.
[01:25:07.826 --> 01:25:08.607]  I appreciate your call.
[01:25:10.048 --> 01:25:11.429]  And the evidence is involved.
[01:25:12.009 --> 01:25:14.271]  Let's go to Julian in Texas.
[01:25:14.331 --> 01:25:15.332]  Julian, you're on the air.
[01:25:15.352 --> 01:25:17.913]  Hello, Alex, can you hear me?
[01:25:18.074 --> 01:25:18.314]  Yes.
[01:25:19.895 --> 01:25:28.001]  Yes, I wanted to talk about the skull and bones and how it relates to our current currency in the newly redesigned, like, five to hundred dollar bills.
[01:25:28.821 --> 01:25:32.264]  Well, there's all sorts of occultic numerology and garbage all over our money.
[01:25:33.285 --> 01:25:36.027]  Yeah, but are you aware of the letter E and how it
[01:25:37.210 --> 01:25:41.456]  When you turn on its side, on some fonts it looks like the Triforce.
[01:25:42.878 --> 01:25:43.439]  Are you aware of that?
[01:25:43.459 --> 01:25:45.642]  The power, courage, and justice that they believe in?
[01:25:46.423 --> 01:25:46.724]  Yes.
[01:25:48.526 --> 01:25:50.649]  And how when you fold the $20 bill in half,
[01:25:53.348 --> 01:26:00.031]  The top, it has nine, when you separate it into four sections, it has nine, and then the bottom's one, and on the back is one.
[01:26:00.051 --> 01:26:01.392]  Yeah, well let me be clear, Julian.
[01:26:01.472 --> 01:26:04.553]  The globalists are obsessed with numerology and the occult.
[01:26:05.073 --> 01:26:05.814]  They believe in it.
[01:26:05.994 --> 01:26:06.734]  I don't believe in it.
[01:26:06.754 --> 01:26:09.555]  But for listeners, I'm not saying I believe in this.
[01:26:09.656 --> 01:26:14.038]  It's like, do you believe in a religion that pygmies have in Central Africa, in the Congo?
[01:26:14.158 --> 01:26:14.358]  No.
[01:26:14.838 --> 01:26:17.179]  But do they practice worshipping rocks and trees?
[01:26:17.299 --> 01:26:17.599]  Yes.
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:19.040]  And yes.
[01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:19.660]  It's
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:40.184]  The Republican leadership, predominantly, has gay orgies at Bohemian Grove.
[01:26:40.224 --> 01:26:41.725]  That's even in Vanity Fair.
[01:26:42.046 --> 01:26:43.967]  One of their guys finally snuck in two years ago.
[01:26:44.427 --> 01:26:46.329]  Got fired over it, but did witness it.
[01:26:46.849 --> 01:26:49.852]  And what you think is going on is not what's happening.
[01:26:50.112 --> 01:26:54.936]  But I mean, who else but Satanists would let Dyncor and Halliburton run white slavery rings?
[01:26:55.336 --> 01:26:57.798]  And it's put in the Chicago Tribune and nobody gets in trouble.
[01:26:58.218 --> 01:27:01.401]  It's a bunch of hedonistic Satan worshippers that run everything.
[01:27:03.658 --> 01:27:05.659]  Yeah, it is.
[01:27:05.699 --> 01:27:12.681]  My film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, and The Order of Death, two films on one DVD, covers it all.
[01:27:12.721 --> 01:27:13.142]  But go ahead.
[01:27:14.522 --> 01:27:22.325]  Yeah, and like you see the folding paper money, like foldingmoney.com, but where it shows like the
[01:27:23.672 --> 01:27:26.134]  That the Twin Towers were hit in smoke and then they're coming down.
[01:27:26.154 --> 01:27:27.596]  Well, it shows the whole progression.
[01:27:27.636 --> 01:27:30.138]  It shows them not being hit, being hit, then crumbling.
[01:27:30.439 --> 01:27:31.360]  I appreciate your call.
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:31.680]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:32.541 --> 01:27:38.607]  Literally scores of news ads, TV shows, Fox TV six months before released
[01:27:39.247 --> 01:27:57.635]  A lone government episode, uh, spent off of the X-Files, where the government hijacks a jet, a jumbo jet, by remote control to fly it in the World Trade Center to declare martial law and attack Afghanistan, but the rest of the government stands down because the government runs a drill of it being a drill, and then exactly that happened on 9-11.
[01:27:59.034 --> 01:28:05.723]  And it just goes on and on and on and on and on and on because it's their religion.
[01:28:05.763 --> 01:28:07.144]  It's called lesser magic.
[01:28:07.785 --> 01:28:13.252]  They have to do the ritual first in front of you in a smaller way, like a model of it.
[01:28:13.612 --> 01:28:15.435]  They believe to successfully carry it out.
[01:28:15.475 --> 01:28:16.135]  It's also kind of like
[01:28:17.423 --> 01:28:24.988]  All this stuff is superstition, but it goes back to the Greeks, and every other culture, the Japanese, the Aztecs, they all believed in vampires.
[01:28:25.128 --> 01:28:25.448]  I don't.
[01:28:26.228 --> 01:28:33.253]  But a vampire is a symbol of a psychopathic guild, or a club of psychos who go out at night and kill people.
[01:28:34.033 --> 01:28:41.158]  And vampires have to come to your business or house, make a deal with you, and trick you to invite them in once, so they can come in again.
[01:28:42.085 --> 01:28:46.887]  And so that's why they admit their world government to you, and then the other side of their mouth say it doesn't exist.
[01:28:47.528 --> 01:28:51.649]  And that's why they put all their symbols out about how they're killing us and tell us what they're doing for their movies.
[01:28:53.050 --> 01:28:55.231]  They even believe that that's the job I'm fulfilling.
[01:28:55.251 --> 01:28:57.032]  They believe you're too weak and won't stand up to them.
[01:28:57.152 --> 01:28:59.273]  I believe you're strong and will stand up to them.
[01:29:02.901 --> 01:29:06.722]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[01:30:05.461 --> 01:30:09.004]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.

[01:31:02.783 --> 01:31:08.187]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:31:09.447 --> 01:31:14.190]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:31:14.590 --> 01:31:21.375]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:31:23.316 --> 01:31:26.118]  They sew pride in every stitch.

[01:31:59.191 --> 01:31:59.652]  Got it.
[01:31:59.972 --> 01:32:00.832]  Others don't.
[01:32:01.940 --> 01:32:06.163]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:06.483 --> 01:32:06.764]  Number 1.
[01:32:07.404 --> 01:32:10.566]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:10.827 --> 01:32:11.387]  Number 2.
[01:32:11.687 --> 01:32:16.231]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:16.571 --> 01:32:17.031]  It's true.
[01:32:17.331 --> 01:32:21.875]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:22.195 --> 01:32:22.735]  Number 3.
[01:32:23.016 --> 01:32:26.298]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:26.598 --> 01:32:30.281]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:30.501 --> 01:32:31.062]  Number 4.
[01:32:31.302 --> 01:32:33.664]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:34.064 --> 01:32:37.448]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:37.748 --> 01:32:38.288]  Number 5.
[01:32:38.529 --> 01:32:42.452]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:42.692 --> 01:32:47.437]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:47.737 --> 01:32:51.760]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:32:58.544 --> 01:33:04.748]  Coast to Coast.
[01:33:05.128 --> 01:33:06.569]  Direct from Austin.
[01:33:07.169 --> 01:33:10.391]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:32.569 --> 01:33:33.570]  We are back live.
[01:33:33.630 --> 01:33:35.251]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:33:35.931 --> 01:33:38.353]  It is Sunday, the 19th day of September, 2010.
[01:33:38.393 --> 01:33:42.836]  I want to continue with Scanner, Nate, John, Tom, Darren, and Emmanuel.
[01:33:42.856 --> 01:33:43.857]  That'll be it for calls, though.
[01:33:43.877 --> 01:33:45.718]  We'll get to at least those next six.
[01:33:45.758 --> 01:33:48.120]  Sorry to others, but I can get to those.
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:51.982]  In the first hour, I predominantly covered this report.
[01:33:52.203 --> 01:33:53.503]  Hot off the presses today.
[01:33:54.344 --> 01:33:58.586]  September 19th at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:33:58.667 --> 01:34:03.909]  Globalist push world transaction tax at UN Summit.
[01:34:05.130 --> 01:34:06.911]  Very important to get this out to everybody.
[01:34:07.371 --> 01:34:11.094]  And they admit the new global currency they want to set up and tax you to fund.
[01:34:11.174 --> 01:34:13.095]  And it's privately owned and run.
[01:34:14.079 --> 01:34:20.020]  So now they're getting rid of any pretenses of there even being a government you run or it being public.
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:23.321]  It's totally private, but it uses government power to rob you.
[01:34:23.921 --> 01:34:31.862]  Now, John P. Holdren, I talk a lot about this, but we've learned he's written four books, well you can count one of them as five, and a whole bunch of pamphlets.
[01:34:32.342 --> 01:34:33.702]  He's the White House science czar.
[01:34:33.742 --> 01:34:42.604]  He wrote Ecoscience, Population, Resources, and Environment, calling for world government, planetary police state, forced drugging, forced sterilization, and the water supply.
[01:34:44.312 --> 01:34:45.613]  Bisphenol A, all of it.
[01:34:47.755 --> 01:34:56.662]  And the UN, all these people say global government's about destroying the economy, so they can consolidate power and save the earth from overpopulation.
[01:34:57.463 --> 01:34:59.444]  And a lot of yuppies go, yeah, there are too many people.
[01:34:59.885 --> 01:35:03.007]  Well, when you lose your job or get your pay cut, remember, you wanted all this.
[01:35:03.087 --> 01:35:07.851]  Or when your 27-year-old wife can't get pregnant, you don't know why, well, there's too many people.
[01:35:08.392 --> 01:35:09.773]  So you think you're an elitist.
[01:35:09.893 --> 01:35:10.514]  You're not.
[01:35:10.874 --> 01:35:12.195]  You're being targeted by this.
[01:35:12.235 --> 01:35:12.876]  You understand that?
[01:35:13.843 --> 01:35:27.628]  But here's a Cyber News Service report, and he's given a bunch of interviews lately, admitting they've been secretly geoengineering the atmosphere to save us from global warming, admitting that they want to use the free market to quote, de-develop the United States.
[01:35:28.509 --> 01:35:40.733]  Pay you, like put taxes on you if they don't like your business, have neutral taxes if they're neutral, or give you tax incentives or government money if they like it, i.e.
[01:35:40.813 --> 01:35:41.954]  if you're Al Gore and own
[01:35:43.183 --> 01:35:47.329]  More than a dozen different green jobs companies.
[01:35:48.290 --> 01:35:52.335]  So it's their own little private mafia organization where they decide if you can have a job.
[01:35:52.395 --> 01:35:53.737]  They decide if you can have an industry.
[01:35:54.178 --> 01:35:58.223]  Remember Obama with the GM bankruptcy?
[01:35:58.864 --> 01:36:00.005]  And it came out on the news.
[01:36:00.802 --> 01:36:08.947]  That if you were a Democratic contributor and owned some 75-plus-year-old, multi-million-dollar-a-year car dealership, you were left alone.
[01:36:09.367 --> 01:36:18.673]  But if you were somebody who was neutral or a Republican, they would take your dealership and sell it without giving you money or just shut it down.
[01:36:18.973 --> 01:36:21.675]  I mean, these people are bald-faced mafia crooks.
[01:36:22.535 --> 01:36:23.416]  But here's the headline.
[01:36:23.496 --> 01:36:27.999]  White House science czar says he would use free market to de-develop the United States.
[01:36:28.559 --> 01:36:31.121]  Now remember, Bush was supporting the carbon tax in his last year.
[01:36:32.142 --> 01:36:35.224]  You see TV ads with Newt Gingrich and Nancy Pelosi supporting it.
[01:36:35.484 --> 01:36:38.546]  You see Pat Robertson along with Al Sharpton with TV ads supporting it.
[01:36:38.946 --> 01:36:41.008]  The Republican leadership supports this.
[01:36:41.048 --> 01:36:46.852]  Now there are a lot of good Republican candidates or some members of the House that don't support it, like Boehner or Paul.
[01:36:47.452 --> 01:36:49.774]  Yes, we need to get more of those people in.
[01:36:49.994 --> 01:36:55.079]  A lot of Democrats are coming out, saying get rid of all the tax increases that are set to go into effect.
[01:36:55.519 --> 01:36:58.722]  Because they know when you cut taxes, tax receipts go up.
[01:36:59.323 --> 01:37:05.568]  So you'd cut taxes to make tax receipts go up, because it makes the economy speed up, unless you wanted to de-develop.
[01:37:06.491 --> 01:37:06.791]  See?
[01:37:07.111 --> 01:37:08.312]  The government's not stupid.
[01:37:08.352 --> 01:37:08.952]  They know that.
[01:37:09.353 --> 01:37:10.973]  People say the government's a bunch of idiots.
[01:37:10.993 --> 01:37:12.234]  They're just messing everything up.
[01:37:12.514 --> 01:37:13.815]  Yeah, crazy like a fox.
[01:37:14.255 --> 01:37:19.018]  That's why the corporate empire that uses America for its muscle runs almost the entire planet.
[01:37:19.598 --> 01:37:20.899]  That's why they get away with murder.
[01:37:21.179 --> 01:37:22.259]  Because they're dumb.
[01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:24.281]  They're in control because they're stupid.
[01:37:24.601 --> 01:37:32.105]  No, they're in control because they're smart and they're ruthless and people are gullible and are spectators and sit there and suck their thumbs all day.
[01:37:32.705 --> 01:37:36.539]  Now here is a short clip of the interview with John P. Holdren.
[01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:38.607]  The whole thing's up at InfoWars.com.
[01:37:38.647 --> 01:37:38.928]  Here it is.
[01:37:43.363 --> 01:37:53.548]  I want to just ask you, you wrote a massive campaign, must be launched to restore high quality environment in North America and to de-develop the United States in your book Human Ecology.
[01:37:53.568 --> 01:37:56.889]  Could you explain what you meant by de-developing the United States?
[01:37:57.990 --> 01:38:07.875]  What we meant by that was stopping the kinds of activities that are destroying the environment and replacing them with activities that would produce both prosperity and environmental equality.
[01:38:08.215 --> 01:38:08.956]  Thanks a lot.
[01:38:09.436 --> 01:38:11.597]  And how do you plan on implementing that?
[01:38:13.217 --> 01:38:14.498]  Through the free market economy.
[01:38:15.698 --> 01:38:19.681]  And you also talked about a world of zero net physical growth.
[01:38:21.022 --> 01:38:22.302]  Could you talk about that a little bit?
[01:38:24.724 --> 01:38:26.125]  That was in your World Bank essay.
[01:38:26.185 --> 01:38:27.325]  I have another engagement.
[01:38:28.246 --> 01:38:35.010]  cnsnews.com interviewed Holdren in June of this year and he said his past work is a quote stale topic.
[01:38:36.387 --> 01:38:40.709]  I just want to ask you real quick about a lot of your past work.
[01:38:40.949 --> 01:38:42.110]  Oh, that's enough.
[01:38:42.490 --> 01:38:44.851]  The point is, they're implementing all of this now.
[01:38:45.551 --> 01:38:47.472]  And this is the reality.
[01:38:47.592 --> 01:38:48.893]  Scanner in Oklahoma.
[01:38:49.193 --> 01:38:49.813]  You're on the air.
[01:38:49.873 --> 01:38:50.294]  Go ahead.
[01:38:51.254 --> 01:38:51.834]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:38:51.894 --> 01:38:53.335]  I've been a fan of yours for a long time.
[01:38:53.375 --> 01:38:54.235]  First time caller.
[01:38:54.635 --> 01:38:55.636]  Appreciate your eloquence.
[01:38:55.656 --> 01:39:03.700]  A lot of your, I think, very much labored self-education really shows because you have so many complex flowcharts built into your mind.
[01:39:05.333 --> 01:39:05.993]  Sure.
[01:39:24.554 --> 01:39:40.082]  Astrophysicist James McCanney's comments on his shortwave program that he has weekly concerning first, second and third tier science and the fact that the elite have access to what they believe to be the most premier science on Earth.
[01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:52.072]  Which they carefully shield from the mid-grade science, and then like premium and regular gas and so forth, and the dumbed-down... Well, sir, I know this.
[01:39:52.232 --> 01:39:59.860]  I know in the 70s, GM and others had cars that would give you massive horsepower, 300, 400, 500, and get 60 miles to the gallon.
[01:40:03.383 --> 01:40:05.163]  So they have all of that.
[01:40:05.183 --> 01:40:20.547]  And I remember 11 years ago, MIT saying they developed crystal ball search engine technology that as the public got integrated into it, they could predict almost 100% of the time mass movements, over 90% of the time individual movements.
[01:40:20.787 --> 01:40:25.828]  Now Google last month came out and said and demonstrated they can now predict the future
[01:40:26.588 --> 01:40:26.928]  I think?
[01:40:45.174 --> 01:40:51.020]  That's why they want to cut things down to 500 million, in their own words, because they can't give life extension to the public.
[01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:56.185]  That's why they've got to have government take over health care, turn it into death panels, as Bill Gates now admitted two weeks ago.
[01:40:56.205 --> 01:40:59.988]  He said, yeah, kill granny, hire 10 people, hire 10 teachers.
[01:41:00.388 --> 01:41:04.733]  They're introducing the idea that we get ahead by killing people instead of the fact
[01:41:05.313 --> 01:41:10.819]  That we need people to continue to build our base and world population in the West is dropping massively.
[01:41:10.839 --> 01:41:15.344]  1.3 children for every two adults and replacements 2.2.
[01:41:15.604 --> 01:41:19.568]  Because about 2.2% end up dying in car wrecks and other things.
[01:41:19.588 --> 01:41:25.074]  So you need parents to have 2.2 children on average to be able to even keep your population.
[01:41:25.114 --> 01:41:26.595]  The West is 1.3 on average.
[01:41:26.876 --> 01:41:27.757]  Japan's even lower.
[01:41:28.617 --> 01:41:39.443]  So they know what they're doing, and they sell the idea to greedy-minded, weak-minded people, whose paradigm is, somebody's got to lose for me to win, that, hey, let's kill Granny, you'll get ten jobs.
[01:41:39.803 --> 01:41:44.226]  Of course, they mean they're going to kill those ten teachers as soon as they can, not just Granny.
[01:41:44.726 --> 01:41:51.690]  And so they're introducing a new economic, what I call social cannibalism, into our system.
[01:41:51.730 --> 01:41:55.812]  But go ahead and talk about some of the advanced technologies that this physicist was discussing.
[01:41:56.593 --> 01:42:09.057]  Yeah, well, I made some quick notes to try not to hog too much of your precious time, but one of the things McKinney mentioned was the simple fact that in his laboratory he ran a simple experiment using a laser beam and a high-energy electric spark.
[01:42:09.838 --> 01:42:24.063]  He discovered that the laser beam would be deflected towards the spark, and he carefully measured the effect and found that it was the same as the famous experiment where the sun bends starlight towards it, and that confirmed one of Einstein's theories, you know?
[01:42:24.203 --> 01:42:25.063]  Sure, light bends.
[01:42:26.239 --> 01:42:35.748]  This may completely invalidate at least the interpreted results of that theory and may render... Listen, here's another one.
[01:42:35.768 --> 01:42:41.353]  They've got mega massive radio telescopes and when they point them towards one side of the universe...
[01:42:42.314 --> 01:42:47.217]  The laws of physics are different, and now when they're pointing them another direction, they vary.
[01:42:47.657 --> 01:42:49.498]  And so the universe isn't even constant.
[01:42:49.538 --> 01:42:52.300]  That was in The Economist this week.
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:56.342]  And that also mirrors what a lot of other research is doing.
[01:42:56.722 --> 01:43:01.085]  So it's that dimensional layering effect that over great distances...
[01:43:02.756 --> 01:43:04.357]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[01:45:02.233 --> 01:45:06.238]  Alex Jones here with urgent information concerning TrendsResearch.com.

[01:45:14.187 --> 01:45:17.630]  By tracking 300 separately defined domestic and international trends,

[01:46:06.212 --> 01:46:07.133]  Tyranny is here.
[01:46:07.474 --> 01:46:11.117]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:46:11.418 --> 01:46:13.660]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:19.086]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:46:19.506 --> 01:46:25.733]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:46:26.153 --> 01:46:31.697]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:46:32.137 --> 01:46:35.800]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:40.343]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:46:40.603 --> 01:46:46.127]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:46:46.568 --> 01:46:49.510]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:46:50.110 --> 01:46:51.531]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:46:52.091 --> 01:46:52.532]  It's here.

[01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:06.421]  Direct from Austin.
[01:47:07.142 --> 01:47:10.364]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:20.666 --> 01:47:24.749]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:47:25.169 --> 01:47:28.971]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:47:29.552 --> 01:47:37.077]  The global ruling class is in competition against free market and wealth and individual intelligence.
[01:47:38.291 --> 01:47:40.934]  They want you not only out of the way, they want you dead.
[01:47:41.594 --> 01:47:43.156]  And you need to go read their own documents.
[01:47:43.256 --> 01:47:46.219]  Just search UN World Population Reduction documents.
[01:47:46.859 --> 01:47:47.420]  Eugenics.
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:51.083]  They don't just want to kill the infirm or ignorant.
[01:47:51.444 --> 01:47:53.206]  They're actually targeting the intelligent.
[01:47:55.528 --> 01:47:56.709]  They don't want competition.
[01:47:56.749 --> 01:47:59.071]  They're monopoly men, and the ultimate monopoly.
[01:47:59.091 --> 01:48:01.614]  When the Romans, somebody really gave them trouble, they just killed everybody.
[01:48:02.338 --> 01:48:03.621]  And many other cultures did that.
[01:48:04.563 --> 01:48:09.033]  And this is raw, brute power we're dealing with, and it doesn't have to happen.
[01:48:09.969 --> 01:48:13.491]  But, a lot of you want to continue to live in denial, and so you're going to get hurt real bad.
[01:48:13.511 --> 01:48:14.652]  I'm going to get hurt right along with you.
[01:48:15.393 --> 01:48:19.816]  Alright, I want to jam in as many calls as possible, but please have your point or question, because I've got to get to the next person.
[01:48:19.836 --> 01:48:20.496]  We won't get to everybody.
[01:48:20.797 --> 01:48:22.678]  Nate, John, Tom, Darren, Emmanuel, maybe David.
[01:48:22.698 --> 01:48:24.319]  I've got a few other news items I want to hit.
[01:48:24.339 --> 01:48:26.801]  We'll cover more tomorrow, kicking off at 11 a.m.
[01:48:26.861 --> 01:48:31.804]  Central Standard Time, of course, at the GCN Radio Network and Infowars.com.
[01:48:31.844 --> 01:48:33.605]  But, Nate in California, you're on the air.
[01:48:34.706 --> 01:48:35.607]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:48:35.687 --> 01:48:35.867]  Good.
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:44.070]  Yeah, I just wanted to say, if you look at it from a point of the government's trying to do what's best for the country, then obviously they're doing everything wrong.
[01:48:44.090 --> 01:48:48.016]  But if you look at it from the point they're trying to destroy it, then they're doing everything right.
[01:48:48.857 --> 01:48:51.481]  And then we've got all their admissions that they want to destroy it.
[01:48:51.521 --> 01:48:52.642]  This is not our opinion!
[01:48:53.894 --> 01:48:54.134]  Yeah.
[01:48:55.055 --> 01:48:57.996]  I also wanted to say, word of mouth really works.
[01:48:58.016 --> 01:49:00.438]  I just show everybody your videos.
[01:49:00.538 --> 01:49:03.440]  Anybody that has a computer, I say, here, check this out real quick.
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:10.064]  And then, so then my brother-in-law came back and he said he showed everybody in his little union that video.
[01:49:10.124 --> 01:49:16.187]  And then he said that one of his employees came back and said, thank that guy who ever showed you the Rise of the Republic.
[01:49:16.227 --> 01:49:17.088]  That's the one I showed him.
[01:49:17.528 --> 01:49:18.749]  He said, tell that guy, thank you.
[01:49:18.809 --> 01:49:20.250]  I'm showing everybody I know.
[01:49:20.270 --> 01:49:22.091]  And so my one word
[01:49:27.255 --> 01:49:28.015]  Absolutely.
[01:49:28.476 --> 01:49:36.122]  Look, the power of the human species recognizing a threat, telling person by person, take action.
[01:49:36.522 --> 01:49:37.783]  You know, discredit these people.
[01:49:37.863 --> 01:49:38.784]  Get local control.
[01:49:38.884 --> 01:49:40.025]  Cut the size of government.
[01:49:40.325 --> 01:49:41.606]  Prosecute the mega banks.
[01:49:42.381 --> 01:49:45.222]  And that's why the mega banks are... I may cover it later in the week.
[01:49:45.242 --> 01:49:46.963]  We're getting a lot of harassment, a lot of stuff.
[01:49:47.683 --> 01:49:52.666]  That's why it's important people buy the books, the videos, and support us, because believe me, the enemy's coming after us in a lot of different ways.
[01:49:52.966 --> 01:49:58.388]  I just don't spend our time on it, because I take the attacks as a sign of our success, but it's pretty serious.
[01:49:59.029 --> 01:50:01.270]  And if we give in to all this intimidation, they win.
[01:50:01.290 --> 01:50:03.551]  I mean, you can't roll over to these wolves.
[01:50:04.751 --> 01:50:05.332]  Who's up next?
[01:50:05.412 --> 01:50:06.312]  John in Wisconsin.
[01:50:06.332 --> 01:50:06.892]  You're on the air.
[01:50:08.373 --> 01:50:08.853]  Alex, hi.
[01:50:08.893 --> 01:50:09.593]  It's a real honor.
[01:50:11.303 --> 01:50:14.565]  Ever since 07, my eyes have been open because of Endgame.
[01:50:15.085 --> 01:50:22.209]  I would say you woke me up, but I think it just reconfirmed what I already knew all along about the world and the way things have been structured.
[01:50:22.909 --> 01:50:24.070]  So I really want to thank you.
[01:50:24.790 --> 01:50:29.293]  I've never, you know, spent a dime on any of your products, but somehow your knowledge has gotten to me.
[01:50:29.413 --> 01:50:31.114]  So it's just a real honor.
[01:50:31.194 --> 01:50:31.854]  First of all, just to
[01:50:32.691 --> 01:50:33.432]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:50:33.472 --> 01:50:36.555]  Listen, we would give it all away for free if we could, but we do.
[01:50:37.436 --> 01:50:41.441]  People just get it all at PrisonPlanet.tv first, being members, that finances the bandwidth.
[01:50:41.921 --> 01:50:45.505]  I make the DVD films, people buy them, but then I say make copies of them.
[01:50:45.886 --> 01:50:48.088]  My mission is to reach people, period.
[01:50:49.149 --> 01:50:53.995]  And really, I'm looking forward to that new Eugenics film, because even the concept of Eugenics was just
[01:50:54.855 --> 01:50:58.157]  It was there in the background, like all throughout college, it was always there.
[01:50:58.177 --> 01:51:01.879]  It was like watching an animal film on Discovery Channel or something, you know?
[01:51:01.899 --> 01:51:10.485]  You got 90% of really awesome visuals of animals and life and the world, and then that 10% of their bull, you know?
[01:51:12.146 --> 01:51:14.988]  Isn't the world wonderful, but humans are evil.
[01:51:15.048 --> 01:51:16.209]  We've got to get rid of them.
[01:51:16.549 --> 01:51:31.142]  And that's so you turn off your self-preservation mode and see yourself as bad so you can live under guilt and they, the government, and the anointed priest class, they're going to teach you how to be their slave to atone for your evil.
[01:51:32.188 --> 01:51:40.757]  Exactly, and I was a math comm major, so they really stuck it home, you know, like, it was unbelievable, you know, the whole screaming fire in a theater kind of concept and everything.
[01:51:40.817 --> 01:51:49.627]  It was, it was really funny how they really try to hone down when you're trying to, you know, study the press, you know, just how much that you need to be under their thumb in order to really figure it out.
[01:51:50.676 --> 01:51:53.958]  I just have a real quick question and a heads up.
[01:51:54.278 --> 01:51:57.379]  I saw a preview for the new CSI episode, the season opener.
[01:51:57.399 --> 01:51:59.160]  It looks like some kind of a big bomb thing.
[01:51:59.240 --> 01:52:02.002]  It looks like they're going to try to... It's Bruckheimer, you know?
[01:52:02.282 --> 01:52:03.762]  The terrorists are going to get us!
[01:52:03.942 --> 01:52:10.746]  They simulate real terror all over TV so people accept television as if it's reality at a subconscious level.
[01:52:11.006 --> 01:52:13.247]  So they're all so afraid Al-Qaeda is going to get them.
[01:52:14.426 --> 01:52:14.947]  Exactly.
[01:52:14.967 --> 01:52:17.732]  Um, so I just wanted to put that out there for any of the listeners.
[01:52:17.812 --> 01:52:20.657]  If they're watching it, you know, let us know if it's creepy or whatever.
[01:52:20.697 --> 01:52:23.222]  I don't watch TV anymore because it's, it's just such a sham.
[01:52:24.296 --> 01:52:28.778]  I guess the question I've got is, I mean, everything I've studied kind of hinges on 9-11.
[01:52:28.798 --> 01:52:30.458]  It hinges on the Israelis.
[01:52:31.218 --> 01:52:36.480]  I just, I kind of wonder if Israel is just like the military arm of the Rothschild family.
[01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:39.001]  I mean, the Rothschilds have owned banking for so long.
[01:52:39.501 --> 01:52:45.103]  You know, it just, it begs the question, you know, is this the muscle they've always wanted all these years?
[01:52:45.303 --> 01:52:45.843]  You know, like,
[01:52:46.283 --> 01:52:54.665]  You know, I've studied the New World Order in depth, and if you look at Israel, England, Germany, all these countries are under the same management system.
[01:52:55.345 --> 01:53:07.487]  And so the globalists have spent a lot of money and time always trying to infiltrate our movement, almost like a cult, and make people only focus on one group or another, whereas we cover it all.
[01:53:07.907 --> 01:53:14.429]  When Israeli spies have been caught, you know, working for Homeland Security, putting Americans on list, we've been covering it for four days non-stop.
[01:53:16.249 --> 01:53:20.293]  Again, we also point out NLE09 and other documents where other governments are doing it.
[01:53:20.593 --> 01:53:25.137]  This is a global government and all these countries are states of that world government.
[01:53:25.157 --> 01:53:26.178]  John, I appreciate your call.
[01:53:26.218 --> 01:53:27.639]  We've got to move really fast now.
[01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:29.381]  Tom in Connecticut, go ahead.
[01:53:30.876 --> 01:53:32.437]  Alex, it's a pleasure to speak to you.
[01:53:33.297 --> 01:53:33.597]  Welcome.
[01:53:33.617 --> 01:53:36.498]  I was wondering if you get a foreknowledge of who the up-and-coming Skull and Bones members are?
[01:53:48.323 --> 01:53:51.485]  Skull and Bones is Chapter 322 at Yale.
[01:53:51.965 --> 01:53:57.389]  It's only one of the elite little bevies of this system.
[01:53:58.129 --> 01:54:05.294]  And I mean, you could go look at who the most elite families are, who the grandkids of presidents are, and I mean, you'll know who Skull and Bones is going to be.
[01:54:06.437 --> 01:54:06.697]  Okay.
[01:54:07.218 --> 01:54:14.065]  Another thing is something that's been a lot of people have been talking to me about here has to do with the Restore America plan.
[01:54:14.105 --> 01:54:16.247]  I don't know if you ever heard of it with Tim Turner.
[01:54:16.828 --> 01:54:20.371]  Do you have any knowledge about it and your thoughts on it, if you could, please?
[01:54:20.571 --> 01:54:21.072]  No, I don't.
[01:54:21.152 --> 01:54:22.894]  I appreciate your call, Tom.
[01:54:23.014 --> 01:54:24.135]  Darren in Canada.
[01:54:24.175 --> 01:54:24.776]  You're on the air.
[01:54:26.246 --> 01:54:26.927]  Hey, how's it going?
[01:54:27.147 --> 01:54:28.708]  I appreciate what you do.
[01:54:28.968 --> 01:54:29.689]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:54:29.829 --> 01:54:30.389]  Thank you for calling.
[01:54:30.409 --> 01:54:36.554]  I just want to shout out a website, Vote World Parliament, on the topic of world government.
[01:54:36.594 --> 01:54:40.276]  If people don't believe it, go to voteworldparliament.org.
[01:54:40.396 --> 01:54:45.220]  Oh, they've got hundreds of groups, almost all Rockefeller or Rothschild funded, just openly teaching kids.
[01:54:45.660 --> 01:54:55.992]  They take all the brightest students worldwide and put them in model UN organizations, just training them for world government, putting them in the petty power position of simulating being world leaders.
[01:54:56.453 --> 01:54:58.936]  And so putting in their mind, the power is global.
[01:54:59.176 --> 01:55:00.598]  The power is overseas.
[01:55:00.978 --> 01:55:02.120]  We give up our rights.
[01:55:03.482 --> 01:55:10.508]  Selling a book, Rescue Plan for the Planet Earth, and then it's World Parliament through Global Referendum.
[01:55:12.049 --> 01:55:22.157]  And another thing for Canadians to look up if they want to know what they can do, go to thinkfree.ca and look up Robert Menard videos on YouTube.
[01:55:22.918 --> 01:55:26.560]  Well, the good news is, and I appreciate your call everywhere, Darren,
[01:55:28.820 --> 01:55:42.184]  In city councils and parliaments and regional parliaments, state legislatures, the EU Parliament people are getting up, exposing world government, speaking out against Herman Van Rompuy, the head of the EU, who's openly been announcing world government.
[01:55:42.624 --> 01:55:45.785]  And of course their planes crash, but thank God some of them live.
[01:55:48.604 --> 01:55:57.170]  The British member of the EU Parliament, Nigel Farage, but they can't kill us all and they can't kill an idea.
[01:55:57.190 --> 01:56:04.055]  As Victor Hugo, the French philosopher, said, no army can stop an idea whose time has come.
[01:56:04.355 --> 01:56:06.617]  One of the most common questions I get is, why are you still alive?
[01:56:06.657 --> 01:56:16.064]  Well, if they killed Alex Jones, it would underline, it would highlight, it would put an exclamation point behind the tens of thousands of videos, the 26 films I've put out, the books,
[01:56:16.977 --> 01:56:17.578]  The material.
[01:56:18.318 --> 01:56:19.779]  So they like to demonize me.
[01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:22.441]  You know, have Nightline come out and say I'm horrible.
[01:56:22.802 --> 01:56:24.223]  You know, have CNN do it.
[01:56:25.184 --> 01:56:26.545]  MSNBC hit pieces.
[01:56:27.904 --> 01:56:31.405]  Mischaracterizing what I stand for and what I really say.
[01:56:31.785 --> 01:56:35.106]  But everything we cover is at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:56:35.446 --> 01:56:36.866]  Everything we cover is in the films.
[01:56:37.266 --> 01:56:39.326]  Everything we cover is free all over the internet.
[01:56:39.827 --> 01:56:43.107]  If you want to buy the books and videos to support us, that's fine, but it's all there.
[01:56:43.887 --> 01:56:53.870]  When I say I have an IMF World Bank document linked here that calls for world government and world taxes to destroy industrial society and consolidate power, I have direct links to it.
[01:56:54.230 --> 01:56:55.330]  Just go read it.
[01:56:56.124 --> 01:56:59.067]  Find out I'm telling you the truth and then start your own radio show.
[01:56:59.328 --> 01:57:00.169]  Start your own blog.
[01:57:00.209 --> 01:57:01.450]  Get your own access TV show.
[01:57:01.710 --> 01:57:02.411]  Get my films.
[01:57:02.491 --> 01:57:03.072]  Make copies.
[01:57:03.112 --> 01:57:03.793]  Give them to everybody.
[01:57:04.073 --> 01:57:05.034]  Start an organization.
[01:57:05.355 --> 01:57:07.257]  You don't have to save the world by yourself.
[01:57:07.337 --> 01:57:09.319]  The act of resistance is victory.
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:13.304]  The act of getting informed, having the knowledge that is power.
[01:57:13.484 --> 01:57:14.165]  What did Christ say?
[01:57:14.205 --> 01:57:15.606]  The people perish for lack of knowledge.
[01:57:16.167 --> 01:57:24.831]  Get the knowledge, become informed, and what the criminals running society have done is all wrapped in high-tech packaging and public relations propaganda.
[01:57:25.171 --> 01:57:33.695]  But once you have the truth, I mean, it's like a 700-pound linebacker who can bench press 2,000 pounds and has got legs the size of tree trunks.
[01:57:33.955 --> 01:57:36.976]  You're going to throw that defensive line out of your way.
[01:57:37.016 --> 01:57:37.997]  You're going to run over
[01:57:39.187 --> 01:57:42.209]  And send anybody you hit to the hospital in the information war.
[01:57:42.769 --> 01:57:43.450]  We're out of time.
[01:57:43.490 --> 01:57:44.690]  See you back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:57:44.730 --> 01:57:45.131]  Central.
[01:57:45.491 --> 01:57:46.431]  God bless you all.
[01:57:46.552 --> 01:57:47.592]  Great job, crew.
[01:57:52.755 --> 01:57:53.196]  Hi, folks.
[01:57:53.216 --> 01:57:53.916]  This is Alex Jones.
